The _Survey_ is a masterpiece of\r\ntopographical literature written by a Londoner of ripe experience, who\r\nwas interested in everything that occurred around him.\r\n\r\nStow founded his work upon documents of great value collected by\r\nhimself, and also upon the splendid series of manuscripts belonging to\r\nthe city of London, to which he had access as “fee’d chronicler” of the\r\ncorporation.\r\n\r\nThe great charm of the book to the general reader is to be found in\r\nthe personal touches by which we are informed of changes and incidents\r\nwhich occurred in Stow’s own experience. Of this special feature several\r\ninstances have been singled out, such as the boy fetching milk from\r\nthe farm attached to the abbey of the minoresses, for which he paid\r\none halfpenny for three pints; and the staking out by the tyrannical\r\nThomas Cromwell of part of the gardens of Stow’s father and others\r\nin Throgmorton Street to be added to his own garden, which after his\r\nexecution came into the possession of the Drapers’ Company, and are now\r\ncovered by Throgmorton Avenue. Stow, in his description of the monuments\r\nof St. Paul’s, alluding to the burial places of Sir Philip Sidney, Sir\r\nFrancis Walsingham and Sir Christopher Hatton, says of the latter\r\n“under a most sumptuous monument where merry poet writ thus--\r\n\r\n    “Philip and Francis have no tombe,\r\n    For great Christopher takes all the roome.”\r\n\r\nHenry Holland, in his _Monumenta Sepulchralia Sancti Pauli_, 1614, tells\r\nus that there is “no doubt but the merry poet was the merry old man Stow\r\nhimself.”\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of his life Stow was indefatigable in his work, but\r\nhe kept the best wine for the last. The first edition of the _Survey\r\nof London_ was published in 1598, when he was past seventy years of\r\nage, but there can be no doubt that the whole of his previous life\r\nwas a preparation for his great work. He always lived in London, and\r\nhe was interested in every particular connected with his native city.\r\nNothing of value in its history ever escaped him, and what he did not\r\npersonally know, he often obtained information of from older men than\r\nhimself. Some of his informants could tell what their fathers saw, so\r\nthat their reminiscences often take us back to a long past time. It is\r\nthis mixture of the personal remembrances of old men with his own memory\r\nof what he had seen, and his careful examination of places himself, in\r\ncorroboration of tradition, which give such special value to his book.\r\n\r\nStow was always in search of information at first hand, and other\r\nauthors were glad to avail themselves of his wide experience. Sir George\r\nBuck, when writing the _History of Richard III._, availed himself of\r\nStow’s information that he had talked to old men who remembered that\r\nmaligned king as “a comely prince.” Stow’s arrangement of his materials\r\nis admirable, and many modern topographers might imitate him with\r\nadvantage. He himself acknowledged that the model for his _Survey_ was\r\nhis friend William Lambarde’s excellent _Perambulation of Kent_, 1576.\r\nSome of his explanations of the names of places, being grounded on\r\nhistorical evidence, are often of great value, but others are little\r\nbetter than crude guesses. This is not to the discredit of an author\r\nwriting in the sixteenth century, but some modern writers, who ought to\r\nhave a better knowledge of the origin of place names, have been unwise\r\nenough to quote these as possible etymologies. Mr. C. L. Kingsford, in\r\nhis excellent edition of the _Survey_, has corrected most of these from\r\ntrustworthy old documents. Stow improved his book in the second edition,\r\npublished in 1603, two years before his death, but he omitted some\r\npassages in the first edition which are of interest to us, and which are\r\nnoted in this edition.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is chiefly the _Survey_ which keeps Stow’s memory green in\r\npopular esteem, his other literary productions were highly appreciated\r\nby many distinguished contemporaries. He found a valuable patron in\r\nArchbishop Parker, for whom he edited some old chronicles. Among his\r\nmany friends must be named Camden, Lambarde, Savile, Dr. Dee, Robert\r\nGlover, Somerset Herald, and Fleetwood the Recorder, who hung in his\r\nstudy a portrait of Stow inscribed, “Johannes Stowe, Antiquarius\r\nAngliæ.” The “antiquary” was very proud of this honour, and he told\r\nMassingham, who records the incident in his diary, that he thought\r\nhimself “worthy of that title for his pains.”\r\n\r\nStow was born about the year 1525, and came of a good London stock, his\r\ngrandfather and father were tallow chandlers, and supplied the church\r\nof St. Michael, Cornhill, with lamp oil and candles. Thomas Stow, the\r\ngrandfather, died in 1527, and directed his body “to be buried in the\r\nlittle green churchyard of St. Michael, Cornhill, nigh the wall as may\r\nbe by my father and mother.”\r\n\r\nWe have no particulars as to John Stow’s schooling, and Mr. Kingsford\r\npoints out that his remarks in the “chapter of Schools and other houses\r\nof Learning,” respecting his seeing the scholars of divers grammar\r\nschools repair to the churchyard of St. Bartholomew, Smithfield, to a\r\nscholastic battle of disputation “hardly suggests that he took part in\r\ntheir exercises.”\r\n\r\nThe general opinion seems to be that he was self-taught, but it is\r\nstrange that the son of a fairly well-to-do citizen should not have\r\nbeen a scholar at one of these free grammar schools. He did not follow\r\nhis father’s business as a tallow chandler, but set up for himself as\r\na tailor, in a house by the well within Aldgate, over which in later\r\ntimes a structure was erected widely known as Aldgate pump. Tailors have\r\nvery generally had to put up with threadbare jokes on their trade, and\r\nStow was no exception to the rule. Aubrey reports that Sir Henry Spelman\r\nsaid to Sir William Dugdale, “We are beholding to Mr. Speed and Stow\r\nfor _stitching_ up for us our English history,” and Aubrey adds, “It\r\nseems they were both tailors.” Stow was admitted to the freedom of the\r\nMerchant Taylors’ Company, on 25th November 1547, but was never called\r\nto the livery or any office in the company. At the same time he seems\r\nto have been highly esteemed, and was helpful to the company. He became\r\na pensioner about 1578, and received four pounds a year until mid-summer\r\n1600; this is sometimes called his “fee” and sometimes his “pension.”\r\nAt the latter date, when he had fallen upon evil days, his pension was\r\nincreased to ten pounds a year. This information is given by Mr. C. M.\r\nClode, under the heading of “the loving brother of this mysterie, John\r\nStowe,” in his _Memorials of the Fraternity_, 1875.\r\n\r\nStow’s first literary work is one that does him great credit, namely,\r\nthe 1561 edition of Chaucer’s works, and subsequently he helped his\r\n“loving friend” Speght with notes from “divers records and monuments,”\r\nwhich that friend used in his edition of Chaucer published in 1597. He\r\nthen turned to the publication of the results of his historical studies.\r\nIn 1565, he brought out _A Summarie of Englyshe Chronicles_, which was\r\nfrequently reprinted, also _The Summarie_ abridged, first in 1566, and\r\noften reprinted. _The Chronicles of England_ were published in 1580 and\r\nnot reprinted. _The Annals of England_ appeared first in 1592, other\r\neditions issued by Stow himself in 1601 and 1605. Editions continued by\r\nEdmond Howes were published in 1615 and 1631.\r\n\r\nThe _Annals_ are much of a compilation, but Stow has made them\r\ninteresting by the frequent insertion of his own opinions and remarks.\r\nThe bibliography of these works is somewhat complicated, but Mr.\r\nKingsford has set forth the dates and distinctive characters of the\r\ndifferent books with much clearness.\r\n\r\nStow early fell into a discord with the chronicler Grafton, and the two\r\nbelaboured one another in print, sometimes having resort to bad puns.\r\nGrafton sneered at the “Memories of superstitious foundations, fables\r\nfoolishly _stowed_ together,” and Stow replied by alluding to “empty\r\n_townes_ and unfruitfull _grafts_ of Momus’ offspring.”\r\n\r\nStow’s life was a stormy one, and he had much to endure, both publicly\r\nand in his own family, but his friends helped him through many of his\r\ndifficulties. His younger brother Thomas was ungrateful, and a thorn in\r\nhis side for many years.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of 1569 he was brought before the Lord Mayor for\r\nhaving in his possession a copy of the manifesto of the Spanish\r\nAmbassador on behalf of the Duke of Alva, but he seems to have been able\r\nto clear himself. The same matter was brought before the master and\r\nwardens of the Merchant Taylors’ Company. Mr. Clode remarks respecting\r\nthis occurrence: “It is curious to note from the depositions of the\r\nseveral examinants how very shy of knowing much about the matter they\r\nappear to have been. The knowledge or memory of the nine taylors\r\nexamined was too frequently failing them to bring guilt home to any\r\nbrother of the craft.”\r\n\r\nThe trouble about the Alva manifesto drew the attention of the Queen’s\r\nCouncil to Stow’s library, and the Bishop of London (Grindal) was\r\ndirected to have his house searched, and in reply the Bishop enclosed\r\nto Cecil a catalogue of “Stowe the taylour his unlawfull bookes,”\r\namongst these are “a great store of folishe fabulous bokes of old prynt\r\nas of Sir Degory, Sir Tryamore,” etc., “old fantastical popish books\r\nprinted in the old type.” Thomas Stapleton’s translation of Bede’s\r\n_Ecclesiastical History_ is among the objectionable books. Nothing,\r\nhowever, came of all this pother.\r\n\r\nStow appears to have been fairly well off for some years of his life,\r\nwhen he spent a considerable amount of money on the extensive collection\r\nof manuscripts which he gathered together. This library was well known\r\nto and much appreciated by his fellow antiquaries. Many of the important\r\ndocuments are now in the British Museum and other public libraries.\r\n\r\nHe gave up his business in order to devote himself uninterruptedly to\r\nhis antiquarian labours. Although these labours were much appreciated\r\nthey were not profitable, and in consequence his means were very limited\r\nin his later years. His poverty was brought under the notice of James\r\nI., who acknowledged his claims, but instead of giving substantial aid\r\nthe king granted letters patent, dated 8th March 1604, authorising John\r\nStow and his deputies to collect money--the “voluntary contribution and\r\nkind gratuities” of the king’s subjects. This authority brought little\r\nmoney to the chronicler’s wasted coffers, and it was indeed a pitiful\r\nreward for the well-directed labours of a life-time.\r\n\r\nStow did not long survive this remarkable instance of royal favour. He\r\ndied on the 6th April 1605, and was buried in the Church of St. Andrew\r\nUndershaft, Leadenhall Street, where his widow erected a terra cotta\r\nmonument to his memory, this, which shows the man as he lived, is one of\r\nthe most interesting monuments in the city of a past London worthy.\r\n\r\nEdmond Howes, his literary executor, and continuator of his _Annals_,\r\nhas left a vivid picture of the old chronicler, which completes this\r\nshort notice of one of the most distinguished “Lovers of London.”\r\n\r\n“He was tall of stature, lean of body and face, his eyes small and\r\ncrystalline, of a pleasant and cheerful countenance; his sight and\r\nmemory very good; very sober, mild, and courteous to any that required\r\nhis instructions; and retained the true use of all his senses unto the\r\nday of his death, being of an excellent memory. He always protested\r\nnever to have written anything either for malice, fear, or favour, nor\r\nto seek his own particular gain or vain-glory; and that his only pains\r\nand care was to write _truth_. He could never ride, but travelled on\r\nfoot unto divers cathedral churches, and other chief places of the land\r\nto search records. He was very careless of scoffers, back-biters, and\r\ndetractors. He lived peacefully, and died of the stone colic, being\r\nfour-score years of age.”\r\n\r\nStow is greatly to be commended for printing as an appendix to his\r\n_Survey_, William Fitzstephen’s _Descriptio Londoniæ_, which originally\r\nformed an introduction to the same writer’s _Life of Becket_. It is a\r\nremarkable relic, and unique in its interest as a vivid description\r\nof London in the twelfth century. The author is carried away by his\r\nenthusiasm, and probably exaggerates the beauties of the city. But he\r\nis not blind to evils, for he wisely says, “The city is delightful\r\nindeed, if it has a good governor,” and we know that it did not always\r\nhave that. The account of the sports of the citizens is particularly\r\nvaluable, especially the early notice of the use of skates on the\r\nMoorfields during the winter time. We may be proud as Englishmen that\r\nno other city in Europe possesses so early a description of a mediæval\r\ntown. It should be noted incidentally that “King Henry the Third”\r\nmentioned at the close of Fitzstephen’s account is not the king usually\r\nknown by that name; but Henry the second son of Henry II. This prince\r\nwas crowned during his father’s life-time; but died in 1182, seven years\r\nbefore his father. Matthew Paris also speaks of him as Henry III.\r\n\r\nAn enlarged edition of the _Survey_ was prepared by Anthony Munday after\r\nStow’s death, and published in 1618. In 1633, four months after Munday’s\r\ndeath, another edition, in folio, appeared “completely finished by the\r\nstudy of A. M., H. D., and others.” John Strype took the matter in hand\r\nin the next century and made a new book of the _Survey_ in two volumes,\r\nfolio, 1720. The sixth edition, enlarged by John Strype, “brought down\r\nto the present time by careful hands,” was published in the same form\r\nin 1754-5. Strype died in 1737. This edition of Stow is an excellent\r\nhistory of London, but most persons will agree with Thomas Hearne in\r\nhis criticism, “Stow should have been simply reprinted as a venerable\r\noriginal, and the additions given in a different character.”\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1842 that Stow’s edition of 1603 was reprinted, when\r\nit was edited by Mr. W. J. Thoms, founder and first editor of _Notes\r\nand Queries_. Mr. C. L. Kingsford produced a critical edition of Stow’s\r\nsecond edition (1603) which is of great value. It was published by the\r\nClarendon Press, Oxford, in 1908. The editor gives an account of Stow’s\r\ncollections and MSS., tracing their present location.\r\n\r\n    HENRY B.

of which none that I know (saving John Norden, for the counties\r\nof Middlesex and Hertford) have vouchsafed their labour to the common\r\ngood in that behalf. And, therefore, concurring with the first, in the\r\nsame desire to have drawn together such special descriptions of each\r\nplace, as might not only make up a whole body of the English chorography\r\namongst ourselves, but also might give occasion and courage to M. Camden\r\nto increase and beautify his singular work of the whole, to the view of\r\nthe learned that be abroad, I have attempted the discovery of London,\r\nmy native soil and country, at the desire and persuasion of some of my\r\ngood friends, as well because I have seen sundry antiquities myself\r\ntouching that place, as also for that through search of records to other\r\npurposes, divers written helps are come to my hands, which few others\r\nhave fortuned to meet withall; it is a service that most agreeth with\r\nmy professed travels; it is a duty that I willingly owe to my native\r\nmother and country, and an office that of right I hold myself bound\r\nin love to bestow upon the politic body and members of the same. What\r\nLondon hath been of ancient time men may here see, as what it is now\r\nevery man doth behold. I know that the argument, being of the chief and\r\nprincipal city of the land, required the pen of some excellent artisan,\r\nbut fearing that none would attempt and finish it, as few have essayed\r\nany, I chose rather (amongst other my labours) to handle it after my\r\nplain manner, than to leave it unperformed. Touching the dedication, I\r\nam not doubtful where to seek my patron, since you be a politic estate\r\nof the city, as the walls and buildings be the material parts of the\r\nsame. To you, therefore, do I address this my whole labour, as well that\r\nby your authority I may be protected, as warranted by your own skill and\r\nunderstanding of that which I have written. I confess that I lacked my\r\ndesire to the accomplishment of some special parts,[1] which some other\r\nof better ability promised to perform; but as I then professed, have\r\nsince out of mine old store-house added to this work many rare notes of\r\nantiquity, as may appear to the reader, which I do afford in all duty,\r\nand recommend to your view, my labours to your consideration, and myself\r\nto your service, during life, in this or any other.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] The Dedication of the first edition is precisely the same, except in\r\nthe concluding paragraph, which there stands as follows:--\r\n\r\n“I confess that I lacked my desire to the accomplishment of some\r\nspeciall partes: but I trust hereafter that shal be supplied, and I\r\nprofesse (if more touching this worke come unto me) to afforde it, in\r\nall dutie. In the meantime I recommend this to your view, my laboures\r\nto your consideration, and myself to your service (as I have professed\r\nduring life) in this or any other.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR TO THE READER\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause amongst others mine authors, I have oftentimes alleged\r\nFitz-Stephens as one more choice than other, namely, for the ancient\r\nestate of this city, more than four hundred years since: and also the\r\nsaid author being rare, I have in this place thought good by impression\r\nto impart the same to my loving friends, the learned antiquaries, as the\r\nauthor wrote it in the Latin tongue; and first to note in effect what\r\nMaster Bale, in commendation of the said author, writeth:\r\n\r\n“William Stephanides, or Fitzstephen, a monk of Canterbury, born of\r\nworshipful parents in the city of London, well brought up at the first\r\nunder good masters, did more and more increase in honest conditions and\r\nlearning; for ever in his young years there appeared in him a certain\r\nlight of a gentleman-like disposition, which promised many good things,\r\nafterwards by him performed. Such time as other spent in brawls and idle\r\ntalk, he employed in wholesome exercises for the honour of his country,\r\nfollowing therein the example of Plato, and was very studious both in\r\nhumanity and divinity.”\r\n\r\nThe city of London, his birth-place, the most noble of all other cities\r\nof this land, and the prince’s seat, situated in the south part of this\r\nisland, he loved above all the other, so that at length he wrote most\r\nelegantly in Latin of the site and rights of the same. Leland, in divers\r\nof his books, commendeth him for an excellent writer. He lived in the\r\nreign of King Stephen, wrote in the reign of Henry II., and deceased in\r\nthe year of Christ 1191, in the reign of Richard I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SURVEY OF LONDON\r\n\r\nCONTAINING\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGINAL, ANTIQUITY, INCREASE, MODERN ESTATE, AND DESCRIPTION OF\r\nTHAT CITY\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the Roman writers,[2] to glorify the city of Rome, derive the\r\noriginal thereof from gods and demi-gods, by the Trojan progeny, so\r\nGeoffrey of Monmouth, the Welsh historian, deduceth the foundation\r\nof this famous city of London, for the greater glory thereof, and\r\nemulation of Rome, from the very same original. For he reporteth that\r\nBrute, lineally descended from the demi-god Æneas, the son of Venus,\r\ndaughter of Jupiter, about the year of the world 2855, and 1108 before\r\nthe nativity of Christ, built this city near unto the river now called\r\nThames, and named it Troynovant, or Trenovant. But herein, as Livy,\r\nthe most famous historiographer of the Romans, writeth, antiquity is\r\npardonable, and hath an especial privilege, by interlacing divine\r\nmatters with human, to make the first foundation of cities more\r\nhonourable, more sacred, and, as it were, of greater majesty.\r\n\r\nKing Lud (as the aforesaid Geoffrey of Monmouth noteth) afterwards\r\nnot only repaired this city, but also increased the same with fair\r\nbuildings, towers, and walls, and after his own name called it\r\nCaire-Lud,[3] as Lud’s town; and the strong gate which he built in the\r\nwest part of the city he likewise, for his own honour, named Ludgate.\r\n\r\nThis Lud had issue two sons, Androgeus and Theomantius, who being not\r\nof age to govern at the death of their father, their uncle Cassibelan\r\ntook upon him the crown; about the eighth year of whose reign, Julius\r\nCæsar arrived in this land with a great power of Romans to conquer it;\r\nthe manner of which conquest I will summarily set down out of his own\r\nCommentaries, which are of far better credit than the relations of\r\nGeoffrey Monmouth.\r\n\r\nThe chief government of the Britons, and ordering of the wars, was then\r\nby common advice committed to Cassibelan, whose seigniory was separated\r\nfrom the cities towards the sea-coast by the river called Thames, about\r\nfourscore miles from the sea. This Cassibelan, in times past, had made\r\ncontinual war upon the cities adjoining; but the Britons being moved\r\nwith the Roman invasion, had resolved in that necessity to make him\r\ntheir sovereign, and general of the wars (which continued hot between\r\nthe Romans and them); but in the meanwhile the Troynovants, which was\r\nthen the strongest city well near of all those countries (and out of\r\nwhich city a young gentleman, called Mandubrace, upon confidence of\r\nCæsar’s help, came unto him into the mainland of Gallia, now called\r\nFrance, and thereby escaped death, which he should have suffered at\r\nCassibelan’s hand), sent their ambassadors to Cæsar, promising to yield\r\nunto him, and to do what he should command them instantly, desiring him\r\nto protect Mandubrace from the furious tyranny of Cassibelan, and to\r\nsend him into their city with authority to take the government thereof\r\nupon him. Cæsar accepted the offer, and appointed them to give unto him\r\nforty hostages, and withal to find him grain for his army; and so sent\r\nhe Mandubrace unto them.\r\n\r\nWhen others saw that Cæsar had not only defended the Trinobants against\r\nCassibelan, but had also saved them harmless from the pillage of his own\r\nsoldiers, then did the Conimagues, Segontians, Ancalits, Bibrokes, and\r\nCassians, likewise submit themselves unto him; and by them he learned\r\nthat not far thence was Cassibelan’s town, fortified with woods and\r\nmarsh ground, into the which he had gathered a great number both of men\r\nand cattle.\r\n\r\nFor the Britons call that a town (saith Cæsar), when they have fortified\r\na cumbersome wood with a ditch and rampart, and thither they resort to\r\nabide the approach of their enemies; to this place therefore marched\r\nCæsar with his legions; he found it excellently fortified, both of\r\nnature and by man’s advice; nevertheless, he resolved to assault it in\r\ntwo several places at once, whereupon the Britons, being not able to\r\nendure the force of the Romans, fled out at another part, and left the\r\ntown unto him: a great number of cattle he found there, and many of the\r\nBritons he slew, and others he took in the chase.\r\n\r\nWhilst these things were doing in these quarters, Cassibelan sent\r\nmessengers into Kent, which lieth upon the sea, in which there reigned\r\nthen four particular kings, named Cingetorex, Carvill, Taximagull, and\r\nSegonax, whom he commanded to raise all their forces, and suddenly to\r\nset upon and assault the Romans in their trenches by the sea-side; the\r\nwhich, when the Romans perceived, they sallied out upon them, slew a\r\ngreat sort of them, and taking Cingetorex their noble captain prisoner,\r\nretired themselves to their camp in good safety.\r\n\r\nWhen Cassibelan heard of this, and had formerly taken many other losses,\r\nand found his country sore wasted, and himself left almost alone by the\r\ndefection of the other cities, he sent ambassadors by Comius of Arras\r\nto Cæsar, to intreat with him concerning his own submission; the which\r\nCæsar did accept, and taking hostages, assessed the realm of Britain to\r\na yearly tribute, to be paid to the people of Rome, giving strait charge\r\nto Cassibelan that he should not seek any revenge upon Mandubrace or the\r\nTrinobantes, and so withdrew his army to the sea again.\r\n\r\nThus far out of Cæsar’s Commentaries concerning this history, which\r\nhappened in the year before Christ’s nativity 54. In all which process\r\nthere is for this purpose to be noted, that Cæsar nameth the city of\r\nTrinobantes, which hath a resemblance with Troynova, or Trinobantum,\r\nhaving no greater difference in the orthography than changing b into\r\nv, and yet maketh an error whereof I will not argue; only this I will\r\nnote, that divers learned men do not think “_civitas Trinobantum_” to\r\nbe well and truly translated, “the city of the Trinobantes;” but it\r\nshould rather be the state, commonalty, or seigniory of the Trinobantes;\r\nfor that Cæsar in his Commentaries useth the word _civitas_, only\r\nfor a people living under one and the selfsame prince and law; but\r\ncertain it is that the cities of the Britons were in those days neither\r\nartificially built with houses, nor strongly walled with stone, but were\r\nonly thick and cumbersome woods, plashed within and trenched about. And\r\nthe like in effect do other the Roman and Greek authors directly affirm,\r\nas Strabo, Pomponius Mela, and Dion a senator of Rome, which flourished\r\nin the several reigns of the Roman emperors, Tiberius, Claudius,\r\nDomitian, and Severus; to wit, that before the arrival of the Romans the\r\nBritons had no towns, but called that a town which had a thick entangled\r\nwood, defended, as I said, with a ditch and bank, the like whereof,\r\nthe Irishmen, our next neighbours, do at this day call Fastness.[4]\r\nBut after that these hither parts of Britain were reduced into the\r\nform of a province by the Romans, who sowed the seeds of civility over\r\nall Europe; this city, whatsoever it was before, began to be renowned,\r\nand of fame. For Tacitus, who first of all authors nameth it Londinum,\r\nsaith, that in the 62nd year after Christ, it was, albeit no colony\r\nof the Romans, yet most famous for the great multitude of merchants,\r\nprovision, and intercourse. At which time, in that notable revolt of the\r\nBritons from Nero, in which 70,000 Romans and their confederates were\r\nslain, this city, with Verulam, near St. Albans, and Maldon in Essex,\r\nthen all famous, were ransacked and spoiled. For Suetonius Paulinus,\r\nthen lieutenant for the Romans in this isle, abandoned it, as not then\r\nfortified, and left it to the spoil.\r\n\r\nShortly after, Julius Agricola, the Roman lieutenant, in the time\r\nof Domitian, was the first that by adhorting the Britons publicly,\r\nand helping them privately, won them to build houses for themselves,\r\ntemples for the gods, and courts for justice, to bring up the noblemen’s\r\nchildren in good letters and humanity, and to apparel themselves\r\nRoman-like, whereas before (for the most part) they went naked, painting\r\ntheir bodies, etc., as all the Roman writers have observed.\r\n\r\nTrue it is, I confess, that afterwards many cities and towns in\r\nBritain, under the government of the Romans, were walled with stone\r\nand baked bricks or tiles, as Richborrow or Ryptacester,[5] in\r\nthe Isle of Thanet, until the channel altered his course, beside\r\nSandwich in Kent; Verulamium,[6] beside St. Albans, in Hertfordshire;\r\nCilcester[7] in Hampshire; Wroxcester[8] in Shropshire; Kencester[9]\r\nin Herefordshire, three miles from Hereford town; Ribcester,[10] seven\r\nmiles above Preston, on the water of Rible; Aldburgh,[11] a mile from\r\nBoroughbridge, or Watling Street, on Ure river, and others; and no doubt\r\nbut this city of London was also walled with stone, in the time of the\r\nRoman government here, but yet very lately, for it seemeth not to have\r\nbeen walled in the year of our Lord 296, because in that year, when\r\nAlectus the tyrant was slain in the field, the Franks easily entered\r\nLondon and had sacked the same, had not God, of his great favour, at the\r\nvery instant, brought along the river of Thames, certain bands of Roman\r\nsoldiers, who slew those Franks in every street of the city.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] “As Rome, the chiefe citie of the world, to glorifie it selfe, drew\r\nher originall from the gods, goddesses, and demy gods, by the Trojan\r\nprogeny, so this famous citie of London for greater glorie, and in\r\nemulation of Rome, deriveth itselfe from the very same originall. For,\r\nas Jeffreye of Monmoth, the Welche historian, reporteth, Brute descended\r\nfrom the demy god Eneas, the sonne of Venus, daughter of Jupiter, aboute\r\nthe yeare of the world 2855, the yeare before Christe’s nativitie, 1108,\r\nbuilded a citie neare unto a river now called Thames, and named it\r\nTroynovant, or Trenovant.”--_1st edition_, 1598.\r\n\r\n[3] _Cair Lundein_, in the list of ancient British cities, preserved in\r\nNennius.\r\n\r\n[4] “The like whereof the Irishmen, our next neighbours, doe at this day\r\ncall _paces_.”--_1st edition_, p. 4.\r\n\r\n[5] Richborough, about one mile and a half from Sandwich, the _Rutupium_\r\nof the Romans, was a place of great importance until destroyed by the\r\nDanes in 1010.\r\n\r\n[6] On the banks of the river Verlam, opposite to St. Alban’s, which is\r\nsupposed to have arisen out of its ruin.\r\n\r\n[7] Silchester, in Hampshire, seven miles from Basingstoke; the _Caer\r\nSegont_ of the Britons, and _Segontium_ of the Romans, and _Silcester_\r\nof the Saxons.

Hereupon the Romans sent unto\r\nthem a legion of armed soldiers, which coming into this island, and\r\nencountering with the enemies, overthrew a great number of them, and\r\ndrove the rest out of the frontiers of the country; and so setting\r\nthe Britons at liberty, counselled them to make a wall, extending all\r\nalong between the two seas, which might be of force to keep out their\r\nevil neighbours, and then returned home with great triumph. The Britons\r\nwanting masons built that wall, not of stone as they were advised, but\r\nmade it of turf, and that so slender, that it served little or nothing\r\nat all for their defence, and the enemy perceiving that the Roman\r\nlegion was returned home, forthwith arrived out of their boats, invaded\r\nthe borders, overcame the country, and, as it were, bore down all that\r\nwas before them.\r\n\r\nWhereupon ambassadors were eftsoon dispatched to Rome, lamentably\r\nbeseeching that they would not suffer their miserable country to be\r\nutterly destroyed: then again another legion was sent, which coming upon\r\na sudden, made a great slaughter of the enemy, and chased him home, even\r\nto his own country. These Romans at their departure, told the Britons\r\nplainly, that it was not for their ease or leisure to take upon them any\r\nmore such long and laborious journeys for their defence, and therefore\r\nbade them practice the use of armour and weapons, and learn to withstand\r\ntheir enemies, whom nothing else did make so strong as their faint heart\r\nand cowardice; and for so much as they thought that it would be no small\r\nhelp and encouragement unto their tributary friends whom they were now\r\nforced to forsake,[12] they built for them a wall of hard stone from the\r\nwest sea to the east sea, right between those two cities, which were\r\nthere made to keep out the enemy, in the selfsame place where Severus\r\nbefore had cast his trench. The Britons also putting to their helping\r\nhands as labourers.\r\n\r\nThis wall they built eight feet thick in breadth, and twelve feet in\r\nheight, right, as it were by a line, from east to west, as the ruins\r\nthereof remaining in many places until this day do make to appear. Which\r\nwork, thus perfected, they give the people strait charge to look well to\r\nthemselves, they teach them to handle their weapons, and they instruct\r\nthem in warlike feats. And lest by the sea-side southwards, where their\r\nships lay at harbour, the enemy should come on land, they made up\r\nsundry bulwarks, each somewhat distant from the other, and so bid them\r\nfarewell, as minding no more to return. This happened in the days of the\r\nEmperor Theodosius the younger, almost 500 years after the first arrival\r\nof the Romans here, about the year after Christ’s incarnation 434.\r\n\r\nThe Britons after this, continuing a lingering and doubtful war with\r\nthe Scots and Picts, made choice of Vortigern to be their king and\r\nleader, which man (as saith Malmesbury[13]) was neither valorous of\r\ncourage, nor wise of counsel, but wholly given over to the unlawful\r\nlusts of his flesh; the people likewise, in short time, being grown\r\nto some quietness, gave themselves to gluttony and drunkenness, pride,\r\ncontention, envy, and such other vices, casting from them the yoke of\r\nChrist. In the mean season, a bitter plague fell among them, consuming\r\nin short time such a multitude that the quick were not sufficient to\r\nbury the dead; and yet the remnant remained so hardened in sin, that\r\nneither death of their friends, nor fear of their own danger, could cure\r\nthe mortality of their souls, whereupon a greater stroke of vengeance\r\nensued upon the whole sinful nation. For being now again infested with\r\ntheir old neighbours the Scots and Picts, they consult with their king\r\nVortigern,[14] and send for the Saxons, who shortly after arrived here\r\nin Britain, where, saith Bede, they were received as friends; but as it\r\nproved, they minded to destroy the country as enemies; for after that\r\nthey had driven out the Scots and Picts, they also drove the Britons,\r\nsome over the seas, some into the waste mountains of Wales and Cornwall,\r\nand divided the country into divers kingdoms amongst themselves.\r\n\r\nThese Saxons were likewise ignorant of building with stone until the\r\nyear 680; for then it is affirmed that Benet, abbot of Wirrall,[15]\r\nmaster to the reverend Bede, first brought artificers of stone houses\r\nand glass windows into this island amongst the Saxons, arts before that\r\ntime unto them unknown, and therefore used they but wooden buildings.\r\nAnd to this accordeth Policronicon, who says, “that then had ye wooden\r\nchurches, nay wooden chalices and golden priests, but since golden\r\nchalices and wooden priests.” And to knit up this argument, King Edgar\r\nin his charter to the abbey of Malmesbury, dated the year of Christ 974,\r\nhath words to this effect: “All the monasteries in my realm, to the\r\noutward sight, are nothing but worm-eaten and rotten timber and boards,\r\nand that worse is, within they are almost empty, and void of Divine\r\nservice.”\r\n\r\nThus much be said for walling, not only in respect of this city, but\r\ngenerally also of the first within the realm. Now to return to our\r\nTrinobant (as Cæsar hath it), the same is since by Tacitus, Ptolemæus,\r\nand Antoninus, called Londinium, Longidinum; of Ammiamus, Lundinum,\r\nand Augusta, who calleth it an ancient city; of our Britons, Lundayne;\r\nof the old Saxons, Lundenceaster, Lundenbrig, Londennir; of strangers\r\nLondra and Londres; of the inhabitants, London; whereof you may read a\r\nmore large and learned discourse, and how it took the name, in that\r\nwork of my loving friend, Master Camden, now Clarencieux, which is\r\ncalled _Britannia_.\r\n\r\nThis city of London having been destroyed and burnt by the Danes and\r\nother Pagan enemies, about the year of Christ 839, was by Alfred, king\r\nof the West Saxons, in the year 886, repaired, honourably restored, and\r\nmade again habitable. Who also committed the custody thereof unto his\r\nson-in-law, Ethelred, Earl of Mercia, unto whom before he had given his\r\ndaughter Ethelfled.\r\n\r\nAnd that this city was then strongly walled may appear by divers\r\naccidents, whereof William of Malmsbury hath, that about the year of\r\nChrist 994, the Londoners shut up their gates, and defended their king\r\nEthelred within their walls against the Danes.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1016,[16] Edmund Ironsides reigning over the West Saxons,\r\nCanute the Dane bringing his navy into the west part of the bridge, cast\r\na trench about the city of London, and then attempted to have won it by\r\nassault, but the citizens repulsed him, and drove them from their walls.\r\n\r\nAlso, in the year 1052, Earl Goodwin, with his navy, sailed up by the\r\nsouth end of the bridge, and so assailed the walls of this city.\r\n\r\nWilliam Fitzstephen, in the reign of King Henry II., writing of the\r\nwalls of this city, hath these words: “The wall is high and great, well\r\ntowered on the north side, with due distances between the towers. On the\r\nsouth side also the city was walled and towered, but the fishful river\r\nof Thames, with his ebbing and flowing, hath long since subverted them.”\r\n\r\nBy the north side, he meaneth from the river of Thames in the east to\r\nthe river of Thames in the west, for so stretched the wall in his time,\r\nand the city being far more in length from east to west than in breadth\r\nfrom south to north, and also narrower at both ends than in the midst,\r\nis therefore compassed with the wall on the land side, in form of a bow,\r\nexcept denting in betwixt Cripplegate and Aldersgate; but the wall on\r\nthe south side, along by the river of Thames, was straight as the string\r\nof a bow, and all furnished with towers or bulwarks (as we now term\r\nthem) in due distance every one from other, as witnesseth our author,\r\nand ourselves may behold from the land side. This may suffice for proof\r\nof a wall, and form thereof, about this city, and the same to have been\r\nof great antiquity as any other within this realm.\r\n\r\nAnd now touching the maintenance and reparing the said wall. I read,\r\nthat in the year 1215, the 16th of King John,[17] the barons, entering\r\nthe city by Aldgate, first took assurance of the citizens, then brake\r\ninto the Jews’ houses, searched their coffers to fill their own purses,\r\nand after with great diligence repaired the walls and gates of the\r\ncity with stone taken from the Jews’ broken houses. In the year 1257,\r\nHenry III. caused the walls of this city, which were sore decayed and\r\ndestitute of towers, to be repaired in more seemly wise than before, at\r\nthe common charges of the city. Also in the year 1282,[18] King Edward\r\nI. having granted to Robert Kilwarby, archbishop of Canterbury, license\r\nfor the enlarging of the Blackfriars’ church, to break and take down\r\na part of the wall of the city, from Ludgate to the river of Thames;\r\nhe also granted to Henry Wales, mayor, and the citizens of London, the\r\nfavour to take, toward the making of the wall and enclosure of the city,\r\ncertain customs or toll, as appeareth by his grant. This wall was then\r\nto be made from Ludgate west to Fleet bridge along behind the houses,\r\nand along by the water of the Fleet unto the river of Thames. Moreover,\r\nin the year 1310, Edward II. commanded the citizens to make up the\r\nwall already begun, and the tower at the end of the same wall, within\r\nthe water of Thames near unto the Blackfriars, etc. 1328, the 2nd of\r\nEdward III., the walls of this city were repaired. It was also granted\r\nby King Richard II. in the tenth year of his reign, that a toll should\r\nbe taken of the wares sold by land or by water for ten years, towards\r\nthe repairing of the walls, and cleansing of the ditch about London.\r\nIn the 17th of Edward IV. Ralph Joceline, mayor, caused part of the\r\nwall about the city of London to be repaired; to wit, betwixt Aldgate\r\nand Aldersgate. He also caused Moorfield to be searched for clay, and\r\nbrick thereof to be made and burnt; he likewise caused chalk to be\r\nbrought out of Kent, and to be burnt into lime in the same Moorfield,\r\nfor more furtherance of the work. Then the Skinners to begin in the east\r\nmade that part of the wall betwixt Aldgate and Bevis Marks, towards\r\nBishopsgate, as may appear by their arms in three places fixed there:\r\nthe mayor, with his company of the Drapers, made all that part betwixt\r\nBishopsgate and Allhallows church, and from Allhallows towards the\r\npostern called Moorgate. A great part of the same wall was repaired by\r\nthe executors of Sir John Crosby, late alderman, as may appear by his\r\narms in two places there fixed: and other companies repaired the rest\r\nof the wall to the postern of Cripplegate. The Goldsmiths repaired from\r\nCripplegate towards Aldersgate, and there the work ceased. The circuit\r\nof the wall of London on the land side, to wit, from the Tower of London\r\nin the east unto Aldgate, in 82 perches; from Aldgate to Bishopsgate, 86\r\nperches; from Bishopsgate in the north to the postern of Cripplegate,\r\n162 perches; from Cripplegate to Aldersgate, 75 perches; from Aldersgate\r\nto Newgate, 66 perches; from Newgate in the west to Ludgate, 42 perches;\r\nin all, 513 perches of assize. From Ludgate to the Fleet-dike west,\r\nabout 60 perches; from Fleetbridge south to the river Thames, about 70\r\nperches; and so the total of these perches amounteth to 643, every perch\r\nconsisting of five yards and a half, which do yield 3536 yards and a\r\nhalf, containing 10,608 feet, which make up two English miles and more\r\nby 608 feet.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] Whitchendus.

In the west suburbs was also another great water,\r\ncalled Oldborne, which had its fall into the river of Wells; then were\r\nthere three principal fountains, or wells, in the other suburbs; to wit,\r\nHoly well, Clement’s well, and Clarkes’ well. Near unto this last-named\r\nfountain were divers other wells, to wit, Skinners’ well, Fags’ well,\r\nTode well, Loder’s well, and Radwell. All which said wells, having the\r\nfall of their overflowing in the aforesaid river, much increased the\r\nstream, and in that place gave it the name of Well. In West Smithfield\r\nthere was a pool, in records called Horsepoole, and one other pool near\r\nunto the parish church of St. Giles without Cripplegate. Besides all\r\nwhich, they had in every street and lane of the city divers fair wells\r\nand fresh springs; and after this manner was this city then served with\r\nsweet and fresh waters, which being since decayed, other means have\r\nbeen sought to supply the want, as shall be shown. But first of the\r\naforenamed rivers and other waters is to be said, as following:\r\n\r\nThames, the most famous river of this island, beginneth a little above\r\na village called Winchcombe, in Oxfordshire; and still increasing,\r\npasseth first by the University of Oxford, and so with a marvellous\r\nquiet course to London, and thence breaketh into the French ocean by\r\nmain tides, which twice in twenty-four hours’ space doth ebb and flow\r\nmore than sixty miles in length, to the great commodity of travellers,\r\nby which all kind of merchandise be easily conveyed to London, the\r\nprincipal storehouse and staple of all commodities within this realm;\r\nso that, omitting to speak of great ships and other vessels of burthen,\r\nthere pertaineth to the cities of London, Westminster, and borough of\r\nSouthwark, above the number, as is supposed, of 2000 wherries and other\r\nsmall boats, whereby 3000 poor men, at the least, be set on work and\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nThat the river of Wells, in the west part of the city, was of old so\r\ncalled of the wells, it may be proved thus:--William the Conqueror in\r\nhis charter to the college of St. Marten le Grand, in London, hath\r\nthese words: “I do give and grant to the same church all the land and\r\nthe moor without the postern, which is called Cripplegate, on either\r\npart of the postern; that is to say, from the north corner of the wall,\r\nas the river of the Wells, there near running, departeth the same moor\r\nfrom the wall, unto the running water which entereth the city.”[19] This\r\nwater hath long since been called the river of the Wels, which name of\r\nriver continued; and it was so called in the reign of Edward I., as\r\nshall be shown, with also the decay of the said river. In a fair book of\r\nparliament records, now lately restored to the Tower, it appeareth[20]\r\nthat a parliament being holden at Carlile in the year 1307, the 35th\r\nof Edward I., “Henry Lacy, earl of Lincoln, complained, that whereas\r\nin times past the course of water, running at London under Oldborne\r\nbridge and Fleete bridge into the Thames, had been of such breadth and\r\ndepth, that ten or twelve ships navies at once, with merchandise, were\r\nwont to come to the foresaid bridge of Fleete, and some of them to\r\nOldborne bridge: now the same course, by filth of the tanners and such\r\nothers, was sore decayed; also by raising of wharfs; but especially,\r\nby a diversion of the water made by them of the new Temple, for their\r\nmills standing without Baynardes Castle, in the first year of King\r\nJohn,[21] and divers other impediments, so as the said ships could not\r\nenter as they were wont, and as they ought: wherefore he desired that\r\nthe mayor of London with the sheriffs and other discreet aldermen, might\r\nbe appointed to view the course of the said water; and that by the oaths\r\nof good men, all the aforesaid hindrances might be removed, and it to be\r\nmade as it was wont of old. Whereupon Roger le Brabason, the constable\r\nof the Tower, with the mayor and sheriffs, were assigned to take with\r\nthem honest and discreet men, and to make diligent search and enquiry\r\nhow the said river was in old time, and that they leave nothing that\r\nmay hurt or stop it, but keep it in the same state that it was wont to\r\nbe.” So far the record. Whereupon it followed that the said river was\r\nat that time cleansed, these mills removed, and other things done for\r\nthe preservation of the course thereof, notwithstanding never brought to\r\nthe old depth and breadth; whereupon the name of river ceased, and it\r\nwas since called a brook, namely, Turnmill or Tremill brook, for that\r\ndivers mills were erected upon it, as appeareth by a fair register-book,\r\ncontaining the foundation of the priory at Clarkenwell, and donation of\r\nthe lands thereunto belonging, as also divers other records.\r\n\r\nThis brook hath been divers times since cleansed, namely, and last of\r\nall to any effect, in the year 1502, the 17th of Henry VII., the whole\r\ncourse of Fleete dike, then so called, was scowered, I say, down to the\r\nThames, so that boats with fish and fuel were rowed to Fleete bridge,\r\nand to Oldborne bridge, as they of old time had been accustomed, which\r\nwas a great commodity to all the inhabitants in that part of the city.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1589 was granted a fifteenth, by a common council of the\r\ncity, for the cleansing of this brook or dike; the money amounting to a\r\nthousand marks, was collected, and it was undertaken, that by drawing\r\ndivers springs about Hampstead heath into one head and course, both\r\nthe city should be served of fresh water in all places of want; and\r\nalso, that by such a follower, as men call it, the channel of this\r\nbrook should be scowered into the river of Thames; but much money\r\nbeing therein spent, the effect failed, so that the brook, by means\r\nof continual encroachments upon the banks getting over the water, and\r\ncasting of soilage into the stream, is now become worse cloyed and\r\nchoken than ever it was before.\r\n\r\nThe running water, so called by William the Conqueror in his said\r\ncharter, which entereth the city, etc. (before there was any ditch)\r\nbetween Bishopsgate and the late made postern called Moorgate, entered\r\nthe wall, and was truly of the wall called Walbrooke, not of Gualo, as\r\nsome have far fetched: it ran through the city with divers windings from\r\nthe north towards the south into the river of Thames, and had over the\r\nsame divers bridges along the streets and lanes through which it passed.\r\nI have read in a book[22] entitled the Customs of London,[23] that the\r\nprior of the Holy Trinity within Aldgate ought to make over Walbrooke\r\nin the ward of Brod street, against the stone wall of the city, viz.,\r\nthe same bridge that is next the Church of All Saints, at the wall.\r\nAlso that the prior of the new hospital, St. Mary Spittle without\r\nBishopsgate, ought to make the middle part of one other bridge next to\r\nthe said bridge towards the north: and that in the twenty-eight year of\r\nEdward I. it was by inquisition found before the mayor of London, that\r\nthe parish of St. Stephen upon Walbrooke ought of right to scour the\r\ncourse of the said brook, and therefore the sheriffs were commanded to\r\ndistrain the said parishioners so to do, in the year 1300. The keepers\r\nof those bridges at that time were William Jordan and John de Bever.\r\nThis water-course, having divers bridges, was afterwards vaulted over\r\nwith brick, and paved level with the streets and lanes where through it\r\npassed; and since that, also houses have been built thereon, so that the\r\ncourse of Walbrooke is now hidden underground, and thereby hardly known.\r\n\r\nLangborne water, so called of the length thereof, was a great stream\r\nbreaking out of the ground in Fenchurch street, which ran down with\r\na swift course, west, through that street, athwart Gra street, and\r\ndown Lumbard street, to the west end of St. Mary Wolnothes church, and\r\nthen turning the course down Shareborne lane, so termed of sharing or\r\ndividing, it brake into divers rills or rillets to the river of Thames:\r\nof this bourn that ward took the name, and is till this day called\r\nLangborne ward. This bourn also is long since stopped up at the head,\r\nand the rest of the course filled up and paved over, so that no sign\r\nthereof remaineth more than the names aforesaid.\r\n\r\nOldborne, or Hilborne, was the like water, breaking out about the place\r\nwhere now the bars do stand, and it ran down the whole street till\r\nOldborne bridge, and into the river of the Wells, or Turnemill brook.\r\nThis bourn was likewise long since stopped up at the head, and in other\r\nplaces where the same hath broken out, but yet till this day the said\r\nstreet is there called High Oldborne hill, and both the sides thereof,\r\ntogether with all the grounds adjoining, that lie betwixt it and the\r\nriver of Thames, remain full of springs, so that water is there found at\r\nhand, and hard to be stopped in every house.\r\n\r\nThere are (saith Fitzstephen) near London, on the north side, special\r\nwells in the suburbs, sweet, wholesome, and clear; amongst which Holy\r\nwell, Clarkes’ well, and Clement’s well, are most famous, and frequented\r\nby scholars and youths of the city in summer evenings, when they walk\r\nforth to take the air.\r\n\r\nThe first, to wit, Holy well, is much decayed and marred with filthiness\r\npurposely hid there, for the heightening of the ground for garden-plots.\r\n\r\nThe fountain called St. Clement’s well, north from the parish church of\r\nSt. Clement’s and near unto an inn of Chancerie called Clement’s Inn, is\r\nfair curbed square with hard stone, kept clean for common use, and is\r\nalways full.\r\n\r\nThe third is called Clarkes’ well, or Clarkenwell, and is curbed about\r\nsquare with hard stone, not far from the west end of Clarkenwell church,\r\nbut close without the wall that incloseth it. The said church took the\r\nname of the well, and the well took the name of the parish clerks in\r\nLondon, who of old time were accustomed there yearly to assemble, and\r\nto play some large history of Holy Scripture.[24] And for example, of\r\nlater time, to wit, in the year 1390, the 14th of Richard II., I read,\r\nthe parish clerks of London, on the 18th of July, played interludes at\r\nSkinners’ well, near unto Clarkes’ well, which play continued three\r\ndays together; the king, queen, and nobles being present. Also in the\r\nyear 1409, the 10th of Henry IV., they played a play at the Skinners’\r\nwell, which lasted eight days, and was of matter from the creation of\r\nthe world. There were to see the same the most part of the nobles and\r\ngentles in England, etc.\r\n\r\nOther smaller wells were many near unto Clarkes’ well, namely Skinners’\r\nwell, so called for that the skinners of London held there certain plays\r\nyearly, played of Holy Scripture, etc. In place whereof the wrestlings\r\nhave of later years been kept, and is in part continued at Bartholomew\r\ntide.\r\n\r\nThen there was Fagges well, near unto Smithfield by the Charterhouse,\r\nnow lately damned up, Todwell, Loder’s well, and Radwell, all decayed,\r\nand so filled up, that their places are hardly now discerned.\r\n\r\nSomewhat north from Holywell is one other well curved square with stone,\r\nand is called Dame Annis the clear, and not far from it, but somewhat\r\nwest, is also one other clear water called Perillous pond, because\r\ndivers youths, by swimming therein, have been drowned; and thus much be\r\nsaid for fountains and wells.\r\n\r\nHorsepoole, in West Smithfield, was some time a great water; and because\r\nthe inhabitants in that part of the city did there water their horses,\r\nthe same was in old records called Horsepoole; it is now much decayed,\r\nthe springs being stopped up, and the land water falling into the small\r\nbottom, remaining inclosed with brick, is called Smithfield pond.[25]\r\n\r\nBy St. Giles’ churchyard was a large water called a Pool. I read in the\r\nyear 1244 that Anne of Lodburie was drowned therein; this pool is now\r\nfor the most part stopped up, but the spring is preserved, and was coped\r\nabout with stone by the executors of Richard Whittington.\r\n\r\nThe said river of the Wells, the running water of Walbrooke, the bourns\r\naforenamed, and other the fresh waters that were in and about this city,\r\nbeing in process of time, by incroachment for buildings and heightenings\r\nof grounds, utterly decayed, and the number of citizens mightily\r\nincreased, they were forced to seek sweet waters abroad; whereof some,\r\nat the request of King Henry III., in the twenty-first year of his\r\nreign,[26] were, for the profit of the city, and good of the whole\r\nrealm, thither repairing, to wit, for the poor to drink, and the rich to\r\ndress their meat, granted to the citizens and their successors, by one\r\nGilbert Sanforde, with liberty to convey water from the town of Teyborne\r\nby pipes of lead into their city.\r\n\r\nThe first cistern of lead, castellated with stone in the city of London,\r\nwas called the great Conduit in West Cheape, which was begun to be built\r\nin the year 1285, Henry Wales being then mayor. The water-course from\r\nPaddington to James head hath 510 rods; from James head on the hill to\r\nthe Mewsgate, 102 rods; from the Mewsgate to the Cross in Cheape, 484\r\nrods.\r\n\r\nThe tun upon Cornhill was cisterned in the year 1401; John Shadworth\r\nthen being mayor.\r\n\r\nBosses of water at Belinsgate, by Powle’s wharf, and by St. Giles’\r\nchurch without Cripplegate, made about the year 1423.\r\n\r\nWater conveyed to the gaols of Newgate and Ludgate, 1432.\r\n\r\nWater was first procured to the Standard in West Cheape about the year\r\n1285, which Standard was again new built by the executors of John\r\nWelles, as shall be shown in another place. King Henry VI., in the year\r\n1442, granted to John Hatherley, mayor, license to take up two hundred\r\nfodders of lead for the building of conduits, of a common garnery, and\r\nof a new cross in West Cheape, for the honour of the city.\r\n\r\nThe Conduit in West Cheape, by Powle’s gate, was built about the year\r\n1442; one thousand marks were granted by common council for the building\r\nthereof, and repairing of the other conduits.\r\n\r\nThe Conduit in Aldermanbury, and the Standard in Fleet street, were made\r\nand finished by the executors of Sir William Eastfield in the year 1471;\r\na cistern was added to the Standard in Fleete street, and a cistern was\r\nmade at Fleetbridge, and one other without Cripplegate, in the year 1478.\r\n\r\nConduit in Gra street, in the year 1491.\r\n\r\nConduit at Oldbourne cross about 1498; again new made by William Lambe\r\n1577.\r\n\r\nLittle conduit by the Stockes market, about 1500.\r\n\r\nConduit at Bishopsgate, about 1513.\r\n\r\nConduit at London wall, about 1528.\r\n\r\nConduit at Aldgate without, about 1535.\r\n\r\nConduit in Lothbury, and in Coleman street, 1546.\r\n\r\nConduit of Thames water at Dowgate, 1568.\r\n\r\nThames water, conveyed into men’s houses by pipes of lead from a most\r\nartificial forcier standing near unto London bridge, and made by Peter\r\nMoris, Dutchman, in the year 1582, for service of the city, on the east\r\npart thereof.\r\n\r\nConduits of Thames water, by the parish churches of St. Mary Magdalen,\r\nand St. Nicolas Colde Abbey near unto old Fish street, in the year 1583.\r\n\r\nOne other new forcier was made near to Broken wharfe, to convey Thames\r\nwater into men’s houses of West Cheape, about Powle’s, Fleete street,\r\netc., by an English gentleman named Bevis Bulmer, in the year 1594. Thus\r\nmuch for waters serving this city; first by rivers, brooks, bourns,\r\nfountains, pools, etc.; and since by conduits, partly made by good and\r\ncharitable citizens, and otherwise by charges of the commonalty, as\r\nshall be shown in description of wards wherein they be placed. And now\r\nsome benefactors to these conduits shall be remembered.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1236 certain merchant strangers of cities beyond the seas,\r\nto wit, Amiens, Corby, and Nele, for privileges which they enjoyed in\r\nthis city, gave one hundred pounds towards the charges of conveying\r\nwater from the town of Teyborne. Robert Large, mayor, 1439, gave to the\r\nnew water conduits then in hand forty marks, and towards the vaulting\r\nover of Walbrooke near to the parish church of St. Margaret in Lothbery,\r\ntwo hundred marks.\r\n\r\nSir William Eastfield, mayor, 1438, conveyed water from Teyborne to\r\nFleete street, to Aldermanbury, and from Highbury to Cripplegate.\r\n\r\nWilliam Combes, sheriff, 1441, gave to the work of the conduits ten\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nRichard Rawson, one of the sheriffs, 1476, gave twenty pounds.\r\n\r\nRobert Revell, one of the sheriffs, 1490, gave ten pounds.\r\n\r\nJohn Mathew, mayor, 1490, gave twenty pounds.\r\n\r\nWilliam Bucke, tailor, in the year 1494, towards repairing of conduits,\r\ngave one hundred marks.\r\n\r\nDame Thomason, widow, late wife to John Percivall Taylor, mayor, in the\r\nyear 1498 gave toward the conduit in Oldbourne twenty marks.\r\n\r\nRichard Shore, one of the sheriffs, 1505, gave to the conduit in\r\nOldbourne ten pounds.\r\n\r\nThe Lady Ascue, widow of Sir Christopher Ascue, 1543, gave towards the\r\nconduits one hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nDavid Wodrooffe, sheriff, 1554, gave towards the conduit at Bishopsgate\r\ntwenty pounds.\r\n\r\nEdward Jackman, one of the sheriffs, 1564, gave towards the conduits one\r\nhundred pounds.\r\n\r\nBarnard Randulph, common sergeant of the city, 1583, gave to the water\r\nconduits nine hundred pounds.[27]\r\n\r\nThus much for the conduits of fresh water to this city.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[19] “This water hath been since that time called Turne mill brooke; yet\r\nthen called the river of the Wells, which name of river,” etc.,--_1st\r\nedition_, p. 11.\r\n\r\n[20] Parliament record.\r\n\r\n[21] Patent record.\r\n\r\n[22] “In an old writing book.”--_1st edition_, p. 14.\r\n\r\n[23] Liber Custom.\r\n\r\n[24] This precise definition of the nature of the performances of the\r\nparish clerks, “some large hystorie of Holy Scripture,” does not occur\r\nin the first edition of the _Survey_.\r\n\r\n[25] “Is but fowle, and is called Smithfield Pond.”--_1st edition_, p.\r\n15.\r\n\r\n[26] Patent, 123.\r\n\r\n[27] In the first edition, Barnard Randulph’s gift is stated to be £700\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TOWN DITCH WITHOUT THE WALL OF THE CITY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ditch, which partly now remaineth, and compassed the wall of the\r\ncity, was begun to be made by the Londoners in the year 1211,[28] and\r\nwas finished in the year 1213, the 15th of King John. This ditch being\r\nthen made of 200 feet broad, caused no small hindrance to the canons of\r\nthe Holy Trinity, whose church stood near unto Aldgate; for that the\r\nsaid ditch passed through their ground from the Tower of London unto\r\nBishopsgate. This ditch, being originally made for the defence of the\r\ncity, was also long together carefully cleansed and maintained, as need\r\nrequired; but now of late neglected and forced either to a very narrow,\r\nand the same a filthy channel, or altogether stopped up for gardens\r\nplanted, and houses built thereon; even to the very wall, and in many\r\nplaces upon both ditch and wall houses to be built; to what danger\r\nof the city, I leave to wiser consideration, and can but wish that\r\nreformation might be had.\r\n\r\nIn the year of Christ 1354, the 28th of Edward III., the ditch of this\r\ncity flowing over the bank into the Tower ditch, the king commanded\r\nthe said ditch of the city to be cleansed, and so ordered, that the\r\noverflowing thereof should not force any filth into the Tower ditch.\r\n\r\nAnno 1379, John Philpot, mayor of London, caused this ditch to be\r\ncleansed, and every householder to pay five pence, which was for a day’s\r\nwork towards the charges thereof. Richard II., in the 10th of his reign,\r\ngranted a toll to be taken of wares sold by water or by land, for ten\r\nyears, towards repairing of the wall and cleansing of the ditch.\r\n\r\nThomas Falconer, mayor, 1414, caused the ditch to be cleansed.\r\n\r\nRalph Joceline, mayor, 1477, caused the whole ditch to be cast and\r\ncleansed, and so from time to time it was cleansed, and otherwise\r\nreformed, namely, in 1519, the 10th of Henry VIII., for cleansing and\r\nscowering the common ditch between Aldgate and the postern next the\r\nTower ditch. The chief ditcher had by the day seven pence, the second\r\nditcher six pence, the other ditchers five pence. And every vagabond\r\n(for so were they termed) one penny the day, meat and drink, at charges\r\nof the city. £95 3_s._ 4_d._\r\n\r\nIn my remembrance also the same was cleansed, namely the Moore ditch,\r\nwhen Sir William Hollies was mayor, in the year 1540, and not long\r\nbefore, from the Tower of London to Aldgate.\r\n\r\nIt was again cleansed in the year 1549, Henry Amcotes being mayor,\r\nat the charges of the companies. And again, 1569, the 11th of Queen\r\nElizabeth, for cleansing the same ditch between Aldgate and the postern,\r\nand making a new sewer, and wharf of timber, from the head of the\r\npostern into the town ditch, £814 15_s._ 8_d._ Before the which time the\r\nsaid ditch lay open, without wall or pale, having therein great store of\r\nvery good fish, of divers sorts, as many men yet living, who have taken\r\nand tasted them, can well witness; but now no such matter: the charge\r\nof cleansing is spared, and great profit made by letting out the banks,\r\nwith the spoil of the whole ditch.\r\n\r\nI am not ignorant of two fifteenths granted by a common council in the\r\nyear 1595, for the reformation of this ditch, and that a small portion\r\nthereof, to wit, betwixt Bishopsgate and the postern called Mooregate,\r\nwas cleansed, and made somewhat broader; but filling again very fast,\r\nby reason of overraising the ground near adjoining, therefore never the\r\nbetter: and I will so leave it, for I cannot help it.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[28] Liber Dunstable. Liber Trinitat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIDGES OF THIS CITY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe original foundation of London bridge, by report of Bartholomew\r\nLinsted, alias Fowle, last prior of St. Mary Overies church in\r\nSouthwark, was this: A ferry being kept in place where now the bridge\r\nis built, at length the ferryman and his wife deceasing, left the same\r\nferry to their only daughter, a maiden named Mary, which with the goods\r\nleft by her parents, and also with the profits arising of the said\r\nferry, built a house of Sisters, in place where now standeth the east\r\npart of St. Mary Overies church, above the choir, where she was buried,\r\nunto which house she gave the oversight and profits of the ferry; but\r\nafterwards the said house of Sisters being converted into a college of\r\npriests, the priests built the bridge (of timber) as all the other great\r\nbridges of this land were, and from time to time kept the same in good\r\nreparations, till at length, considering the great charges of repairing\r\nthe same, there was, by aid of the citizens of London, and others, a\r\nbridge built with arches of stone, as shall be shown.\r\n\r\nBut first of the timber bridge, the antiquity thereof being great, but\r\nuncertain; I remember to have read,[29] that in the year of Christ 994,\r\nSweyn, king of Denmark, besieging the city of London, both by water\r\nand by land, the citizens manfully defended themselves, and their king\r\nEthelred, so as part of their enemies were slain in battle, and part of\r\nthem were drowned in the river of Thames, because in their hasty rage\r\nthey took no heed of the bridge.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in the year 1016, Canute the Dane, with a great navy, came up\r\nto London, and on the south of the Thames caused a trench to be cast,\r\nthrough the which his ships were towed into the west side of the bridge,\r\nand then with a deep trench, and straight siege, he compassed the city\r\nround about.\r\n\r\nAlso, in the year 1052, Earl Goodwin, with the like navy, taking\r\nhis course up the river of Thames, and finding none that offered to\r\nresist on the bridge, he sailed up the south side of the said river.\r\nFurthermore, about the year 1067, William the Conqueror, in his charter\r\nto the church of St. Peter at Westminster, confirmed to the monks\r\nserving God there, a gate in London, then called Buttolph’s gate, with a\r\nwharf which was at the head of London bridge.\r\n\r\nWe read likewise, that in the year 1114, the 14th of Henry I., the river\r\nof Thames was so dried up, and such want of water there, that between\r\nthe Tower of London and the bridge, and under the bridge, not only with\r\nhorse, but also a great number of men, women, and children, did wade\r\nover on foot.[30]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1122, the 22nd of Henry I., Thomas Arden gave the monks of\r\nBermondsey the church of St. George, in Southward, and five shillings\r\nrent by the year, out of the land pertaining to London bridge.\r\n\r\nI also have seen a charter under seal to the effect following:--“Henry\r\nking of England, to Ralfe B. of Chichester, and all the ministers\r\nof Sussex, sendeth greeting, know ye, etc. I command by my kingly\r\nauthority, that the manor called Alcestone, which my father gave, with\r\nother lands, to the abbey of Battle, be free and quiet from shires and\r\nhundreds, and all other customs of earthly servitude, as my father held\r\nthe same, most freely and quietly, and namely, from the work of London\r\nbridge, and the work of the castle at Pevensey: and this I command upon\r\nmy forfeiture. Witness, William de Pontlearche, at Byrry.” The which\r\ncharter, with the seal very fair, remaineth in the custody of Joseph\r\nHolland, gentleman.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1136, the 1st of king Stephen,[31] a fire began in the\r\nhouse of one Ailewarde, near unto London stone, which consumed east to\r\nAldgate, and west to St. Erkenwald’s shrine, in Powle’s church; the\r\nbridge of timber over the river of Thames was also burnt, etc., but\r\nafterwards again repaired. For Fitzstephen writes, that in the reign of\r\nKing Stephen and of Henry II., when pastimes were showed on the river of\r\nThames, men stood in great number on the bridge, wharfs, and houses, to\r\nbehold.\r\n\r\nNow in the year 1163, the same bridge was not only repaired, but newly\r\nmade of timber as before, by Peter of Cole church, priest and chaplain.\r\n\r\nThus much for the old timber bridge, maintained partly by the proper\r\nlands thereof, partly by the liberality of divers persons, and partly\r\nby taxations in divers shires, have I proved for the space of 215 years\r\nbefore the bridge of stone was built.\r\n\r\nNow touching the foundation of the stone bridge, it followeth:--About\r\nthe year 1176, the stone bridge over the river of Thames, at London,\r\nwas begun to be founded by the aforesaid Peter of Cole church, near\r\nunto the bridge of timber, but somewhat more towards the west, for I\r\nread, that Buttolfe wharf was, in the Conqueror’s time, at the head of\r\nLondon bridge.[32] The king assisted this work: a cardinal then being\r\nlegate here; and Richard, archbishop of Canterbury, gave one thousand\r\nmarks towards the foundation; the course of the river, for the time,\r\nwas turned another way about, by a trench cast for that purpose,\r\nbeginning, as is supposed, east about Radriffe, and ending in the west\r\nabout Patricksey, now termed Batersey. This work; to wit, the arches,\r\nchapel and stone bridge, over the river of Thames at London, having been\r\nthirty-three years in building, was in the year 1209 finished by the\r\nworthy merchants of London, Serle Mercer, William Almaine, and Benedict\r\nBotewrite, principal masters of that work, for Peter of Cole church\r\ndeceased four years before, and was buried in the chapel on the bridge,\r\nin the year 1205.[33]\r\n\r\nKing John gave certain void places in London to build upon the profits\r\nthereof to remain towards the charges of building and repairing the\r\nsame bridge: a mason being master workman of the bridge, builded from\r\nthe foundation the large chapel on that bridge of his own charges,\r\nwhich chapel was then endowed for two priests, four clerks, etc.,\r\nbesides chantries since founded for John Hatfield and other.[34] After\r\nthe finishing of this chapel, which was the first building upon those\r\narches, sundry houses at times were erected, and many charitable men\r\ngave lands, tenements, or sums of money, towards maintenance thereof,\r\nall which was sometimes noted and in a table fair written for posterity\r\nremaining in the chapel, until the same chapel was turned into a\r\ndwelling-house, and then removed to the bridge house, the effect of\r\nwhich table I was willing to have published in this book, if I could\r\nhave obtained the sight thereof. But making the shorter work, I find by\r\nthe account of William Mariner and Christopher Eliot, wardens of London\r\nbridge from Michaelmas, in the 22nd of Henry VII., unto Michaelmas\r\nnext ensuing, by one whole year, that all the payments and allowances\r\ncame to £815 17_s._ 2-1/4_d._, as there is shown by particulars, by\r\nwhich account then made, may be partly guessed the great charges and\r\ndischarges of that bridge at this day, when things be stretched to so\r\ngreat a price. And now to actions on this bridge.\r\n\r\nThe first action to be noted was lamentable; for within four[35] years\r\nafter the finishing thereof, to wit, in the year 1212, on the l0th of\r\nJuly, at night,[36] the borough of Southwark, upon the south side the\r\nriver of Thames, as also the church of our Lady of the Canons there,\r\nbeing on fire, and an exceeding great multitude of people passing the\r\nbridge, either to extinguish and quench it, or else to gaze at and\r\nbehold it, suddenly the north part, by blowing of the south wind was\r\nalso set on fire, and the people which were even now passing the bridge,\r\nperceiving the same, would have returned, but were stopped by fire; and\r\nit came to pass, that as they stayed or protracted time, the other end\r\nof the bridge also, namely, the south end, was fired, so that the people\r\nthronging themselves between the two fires, did nothing else but expect\r\npresent death; then came there to aid them many ships and vessels, into\r\nthe which the multitude so unadvisedly rushed, that the ships being\r\ndrowned, they all perished.[37] It was said, that through the fire and\r\nshipwreck there were destroyed about three thousand persons, whose\r\nbodies were found in part, or half burnt, besides those that were wholly\r\nburnt to ashes, and could not be found.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1282, through a great frost and deep snow, five arches of\r\nLondon bridge were borne down and carried away.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1289, the bridge was so sore decayed for want of reparations\r\nthat men were afraid to pass thereon, and a subsidy was granted towards\r\nthe amendment thereof,[38] Sir John Britain being custos of London.\r\n1381, a great collection or gathering was made of all archbishops,\r\nbishops, and other ecclesiastical persons, for the reparations of London\r\nbridge. 1381, Wat Tyler, and other rebels of Kent, by this bridge\r\nentered the city, as ye may read in my _Summary_ and _Annals_.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1395, on St. George’s day, was a great justing on London\r\nbridge, betwixt David Earl of Crawford of Scotland, and the Lord Wells\r\nof England; in the which the Lord Wells was at the third course borne\r\nout of the saddle: which history proveth, that at that time the bridge\r\nbeing coped on either side, was not replenished with houses built\r\nthereupon, as it hath since been, and now is. The next year, on the\r\n13th of November, the young Queen Isabell, commonly called the little,\r\nfor she was but eight years old, was conveyed from Kenington besides\r\nLamhith, through Southwarke to the Tower of London, and such a multitude\r\nof people went out to see her, that on London bridge nine persons were\r\ncrowded to death, of whom the prior of Tiptre, a place in Essex, was\r\none, and a matron on Cornhill was another.\r\n\r\nThe Tower on London bridge at the north end of the draw-bridge (for that\r\nbridge was then readily to be drawn up, as well to give passage for\r\nships to Queenhithe, as for the resistance of any foreign force), was\r\nbegun to be built in the year 1426, John Rainwell being mayor.\r\n\r\nAnother tower there is on the said bridge over the gate at the south end\r\ntowards Southwarke, whereof in another place shall be spoken.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1450, Jack Cade, and other rebels of Kent, by this bridge\r\nentered the city: he struck his sword on London Stone, and said himself\r\nthen to be lord of the city, but were by the citizens overcome on the\r\nsame bridge, and put to flight, as in my _Annals_.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1471, Thomas, the bastard Fawconbridge, besieged this\r\nbridge, burnt the gate, and all the houses to the draw-bridge, that time\r\nthirteen in number.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1481, a house called the common siege on London bridge fell\r\ndown into the Thames; through the fall whereof five men were drowned.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1553, the 3rd of February, Sir Thomas Wyat, and the Kentish\r\nmen, marched from Depeford towards London; after knowledge whereof,\r\nforthwith the draw-bridge was cut down, and the bridge gates shut.\r\nWyat and his people entered Southwarke, where they lay till the 6th of\r\nFebruary, but could get no entry of the city by the bridge, the same\r\nwas then so well defended by the citizens, the Lord William Howard\r\nassisting, wherefore he removed towards Kingstone, etc., as in my\r\n_Annals_.\r\n\r\nTo conclude of this bridge over the said river of Thames, I affirm, as\r\nin other my descriptions, that it is a work very rare, having with the\r\ndraw-bridge twenty arches made of squared stone, of height sixty feet,\r\nand in breadth thirty feet, distant one from another twenty feet,\r\ncompact and joined together with vaults and cellars; upon both sides\r\nbe houses built, so that it seemeth rather a continual street than a\r\nbridge; for the fortifying whereof against the incessant assaults of the\r\nriver, it hath overseers and officers, viz., wardens, as aforesaid, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nFleete bridge in the west without Ludgate, a bridge of stone, fair coped\r\non either side with iron pikes; on the which, towards the south, be\r\nalso certain lanthorns of stone, for lights to be placed in the winter\r\nevenings, for commodity of travellers. Under the bridge runneth a water,\r\nsometimes called, as I have said, the river of the Wels, since Turnemill\r\nbrooke, now Fleete dike, because it runneth by the Fleete, and sometimes\r\nabout the Fleete, so under Fleete bridge into the river of Thames. This\r\nbridge hath been far greater in times past, but lessened, as the water\r\ncourse hath been narrowed. It seemeth this last bridge to be made or\r\nrepaired at the charges of John Wels, mayor, in the year 1431, for on\r\nthe coping is engraven Wels embraced by angels, like as on the standard\r\nin Cheape, which he also built. Thus much of the bridge: for of the\r\nwater course, and decay thereof, I have spoken in another place.\r\n\r\nOldbourne bridge, over the said river of the Wels more towards the\r\nnorth, was so called, of a bourn that sometimes ran down Oldbourne hill\r\ninto the said river. This bridge of stone, like as Fleet bridge from\r\nLudgate west, serveth for passengers with carriage or otherwise, from\r\nNewgate toward the west and by north.\r\n\r\nCowbridge, more north, over the same water by Cowbridge street or\r\nCowlane: this bridge being lately decayed, another of timber is made\r\nsomewhat more north, by Chick lane, etc.\r\n\r\nBridges over the town ditch there are divers; to wit, without Aldgate,\r\nwithout Bishopsgate, the postern called Moorgate, the postern of\r\nCriplegate without Aldersgate, the postern of Christ’s hospital,\r\nNewgate, and Ludgate; all these be over paved likewise, with stone level\r\nwith the streets. But one other there is of timber over the river of\r\nWels, or Fleet dike, between the precinct of the Black Friers, and the\r\nhouse of Bridewell.\r\n\r\nThere have been of old time also, divers bridges in sundry places\r\nover the course of Walbrooke, as before I have partly noted, besides\r\nHorseshew bridge, by the church of St. John Baptist, now called St.\r\nJohn’s upon Walbrooke. I read, that of old time every person having\r\nlands on either side of the said brook, should cleanse[39] the same, and\r\nrepair the bridges so far as their lands extended. More, in the 11th of\r\nEdward III. the inhabitants upon the course of this brook were forced to\r\npile and wall the sides thereof. Also, that in the 3rd of Henry V. this\r\nwater-course had many bridges, since vaulted over with bricks, and the\r\nstreets where through it passed so paved, that the same water-course is\r\nnow hardly discerned. For order was taken in the 2nd of Edward IV., that\r\nsuch as had ground on either side of Walbrooke, should vault and pave it\r\nover, so far as his ground extended. And thus much for bridges in this\r\ncity may suffice.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[29] Will.

(saith Fitzstephen) there were seven double\r\ngates in the wall of this city, but he nameth them not. It may therefore\r\nbe supposed, he meant for the first, the gate next the Tower of\r\nLondon,[40] now commonly called the Postern, the next be Aeldgate, the\r\nthird Bishopsgate, the fourth Ealdersgate, the fifth Newgate, the sixth\r\nLudgate, the seventh Bridgegate. Since the which time hath been builded\r\nthe postern called Moorgate, a postern from Christ’s hospital towards\r\nSt. Bartholomew’s hospital in Smithfield, etc. Now of every of these\r\ngates and posterns in the wall, and also of certain water-gates on the\r\nriver of Thames, severally somewhat may, and shall be noted, as I find\r\nauthority, or reasonable conjecture to warrant me.\r\n\r\nFor the first, now called the postern by the Tower of London, it showeth\r\nby that part which yet remaineth, to have been a fair and strong arched\r\ngate, partly built of hard stone of Kent, and partly of stone brought\r\nfrom Caen in Normandy, since the Conquest, and foundation of the high\r\ntower, and served for passengers on foot out of the east, from thence\r\nthrough the city to Ludgate in the west. The ruin and overthrow of this\r\ngate and postern began in the year 1190, the 2nd of Richard I., when\r\nWilliam Longshampe, bishop of Ely, chancellor of England, caused a part\r\nof the city wall, to wit, from the said gate towards the river of Thames\r\nto the white tower, to be broken down, for the enlarging of the said\r\ntower, which he then compassed far wide about with a wall embattled,\r\nand is now the outer wall. He also caused a broad and deep ditch to\r\nbe made without the same wall, intending to have derived the river of\r\nThames with her tides to have flowed about it, which would not be. But\r\nthe southside of this gate, being then by undermining at the foundation\r\nloosened, and greatly weakened; at length, to wit, after two hundred\r\nyears and odd, the same fell down in the year 1440, the 18th of Henry\r\nVI., and was never since by the citizens re-edified.[41] Such was their\r\nnegligence then, and hath bred some trouble to their successors, since\r\nthey suffered a weak and wooden building to be there made, inhabited by\r\npersons of lewd life, oft times by inquest of Portsoken ward presented,\r\nbut not reformed; whereas of former times the said postern was accounted\r\nof as other gates of the city, and was appointed to men of good credit.\r\nAmongst other, I have read, that in the 49th of Edward III., John Cobbe\r\nwas admitted custos of the said postern, and all the habitation thereof,\r\nfor term of his life, by William Walworth, then mayor of London, etc.\r\nMore, that John Credy, Esq., in the 21st of Richard II., was admitted\r\ncustos of the said postern and appurtenances by Richard Whittington,\r\nmayor, the aldermen, and commonalty, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nAELDGATE\r\n\r\nThe next gate in the east is called Aeldgate, of the antiquity or age\r\nthereof. This is one and the first of the four principal gates, and also\r\none of the seven double gates, mentioned by Fitzstephen. It hath had two\r\npair of gates, though now but one; the hooks remaineth yet. Also there\r\nhath been two portcloses; the one of them remaineth, the other wanteth,\r\nbut the place of letting down is manifest. For antiquity of the gate: it\r\nappeareth by a charter of King Edgar to the knights of Knighten Guild,\r\nthat in his days the said port was called Aeldgate, as ye may read in\r\nthe ward of Portsoken. Also Matilda the queen, wife to Henry I., having\r\nfounded the priory of the Holy Trinity within Aeldgate, gave unto the\r\nsame church, to Norman the first prior, and the canons that devoutly\r\nserve God therein,[42] the port of Aeldgate, and the soke or franchises\r\nthereunto belonging, with all customs as free as she held the same; in\r\nthe which charter she nameth the house Christ’s church, and reporteth\r\nAeldgate to be of his domain.\r\n\r\nMore, I read[43] in the year 1215, that in the civil wars between King\r\nJohn and his barons, the Londoners assisting the barons’ faction, who\r\nthen besieged Northampton, and after came to Bedford castle, where they\r\nwere well received by William Beauchampe, and captain of the same;\r\nhaving then also secret intelligence that they might enter the city of\r\nLondon if they would, they removed their camp to Ware, from thence in\r\nthe night coming to London, they entered Aeldgate, and placing guardians\r\nor keepers of the gates, they disposed of all things in the city at\r\ntheir pleasure. They spoiled the friars’ houses, and searched their\r\ncoffers;[44] which being done, Robert Fitzwalter, Geffry Magnavile\r\nEarl of Essex, and the Earl of Glocester, chief leaders of the army,\r\napplied all diligence to repair the gates and walls of this city with\r\nthe stones taken from the Jews’ broken houses, namely, Aeldgate being\r\nthen most ruinous (which had given them an easy entry), they repaired,\r\nor rather newly built, after the manner of the Normans, strongly arched\r\nwith bulwarks of stone from Caen in Normandy, and small brick, called\r\nFlanders tile, was brought from thence, such as hath been here used\r\nsince the Conquest, and not before.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1471,[45] the 11th of Edward IV., Thomas, the bastard\r\nFawconbridge, having assembled a riotous company of shipmen and other in\r\nEssex and Kent, came to London with a great navy of ships, near to the\r\nTower; whereupon the mayor and aldermen, by consent of a common council,\r\nfortified all along the Thames side, from Baynard’s castle to the Tower,\r\nwith armed men, guns, and other instruments of war, to resist the\r\ninvasion of the mariners, whereby the Thames side was safely preserved\r\nand kept by the aldermen and other citizens that assembled thither in\r\ngreat numbers. Whereupon the rebels, being denied passage through the\r\ncity that way, set upon Aeldgate, Bishopsgate, Cripplegate, Aeldersgate,\r\nLondon bridge, and along the river of Thames, shooting arrows and guns\r\ninto the city, fired the suburbs, and burnt more than threescore\r\nhouses. And further, on Sunday the eleventh of May, five thousand of\r\nthem assaulting Aeldgate, won the bulwarks, and entered the city; but\r\nthe portclose being let down, such as had entered were slain, and Robert\r\nBasset, alderman of Aeldgate ward, with the recorder, commanded in the\r\nname of God to draw up the portclose; which being done, they issued out,\r\nand with sharp shot, and fierce fight, put their enemies back so far as\r\nSt. Bottolph’s church, by which time the Earl Rivers, and lieutenant\r\nof the Tower, was come with a fresh company, which joining together,\r\ndiscomfited the rebels, and put them to flight, whom the said Robert\r\nBasset, with the other citizens, chased to the Mile’s End, and from\r\nthence, some to Popular, some to Stratford, slew many, and took many of\r\nthem prisoners. In which space the Bastard having assayed other places\r\nupon the water side, and little prevailed, fled toward his ships. Thus\r\nmuch for Aeldgate.\r\n\r\n\r\nBISHOPSGATE\r\n\r\nThe third, and next toward the north, is called Bishopsgate, for that,\r\nas it may be supposed, the same was first built by some Bishop of\r\nLondon, though now unknown when, or by whom; but true it is, that the\r\nfirst gate was first built for ease of passengers toward the east, and\r\nby north, as into Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire, etc.; the travellers\r\ninto which parts, before the building of this gate, were forced, passing\r\nout at Aeldgate, to go east till they came to the Mile’s end, and then\r\nturning on the left hand to Blethenhall green[46] to Cambridge heath,\r\nand so north, or east, and by north, as their journey lay. If they took\r\nnot this way, by the east out at Aeldgate, they must take their way by\r\nthe north out at Aeldersgate, through Aeldersgate street and Goswel\r\nstreet towards Iseldon, and by a cross of stone on their right hand, set\r\nup for a mark by the north end of Golding lane, to turn eastward through\r\na long street, until this day called Alder street, to another cross\r\nstanding, where now a smith’s forge is placed by Sewer’s-ditch church,\r\nand then to turn again north towards Totenham, Endfield, Waltham, Ware,\r\netc. The eldest note that I read of this Bishopsgate, is that William\r\nBlund, one of the sheriffs of London,[47] in the year 1210, sold to\r\nSerle Mercer, and William Almaine, procurators or wardens of London\r\nbridge, all his land, with the garden, in the parish of St. Buttolph\r\nwithout Bishopsgate, between the land of Richard Casiarin, towards the\r\nnorth, and the land of Robert Crispie towards the south, and the highway\r\ncalled Berewards lane on the east, etc.\r\n\r\nNext I read in a charter, dated the year 1235, that Walter Brune,\r\ncitizen of London, and Rosia his wife, having founded the priory or new\r\nhospital of our blessed Lady, since called St. Mary Spittle without\r\nBishopsgate, confirmed the same to the honour of God and our blessed\r\nLady, for canons regular.\r\n\r\nAlso in the year 1247, Simon Fitzmarie, one of the sheriffs of London,\r\nthe 29th of Henry III., founded the hospital of St. Mary, called Bethlem\r\nwithout Bishopsgate. Thus much for the antiquity of this gate.[48]\r\n\r\nAnd now for repairing the same, I find that Henry III. confirmed to\r\nthe merchants of the Haunce, that had a house in the city called\r\nGuildhalla Theutonicorum, certain liberties and privileges. Edward I.\r\nalso confirmed the same; in the tenth year of whose reign it was found\r\nthat the said merchants ought of right to repair the said gate called\r\nBishopsgate; whereupon Gerard Marbod, alderman of the Haunce and other,\r\nthen remaining in the city of London, for themselves, and all other\r\nmerchants of the said Haunce, granted two hundred and ten marks sterling\r\nto the mayor and citizens; and covenanted that they and their successors\r\nshould from time to time repair the same gate. This gate was again\r\nbeautifully built in the year 1479, in the reign of Edward IV., by the\r\nsaid Haunce merchants.\r\n\r\nMoreover, about the year 1551, these Haunce merchants, having prepared\r\nstone for that purpose, caused a new gate to be framed, there to have\r\nbeen set up, but then their liberties, through suit of our English\r\nmerchants, were seized into the king’s hand; and so that work was\r\nstayed, and the old gate yet remaineth.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTERN OF MOREGATE\r\n\r\nTouching the next postern, called Moregate, I find that Thomas Falconer,\r\nmayor, about the year 1415, the third of Henry V., caused the wall\r\nof the city to be broken near unto Coleman street, and there built a\r\npostern, now called Moregate, upon the moor side where was never gate\r\nbefore. This gate he made for ease of the citizens, that way to pass\r\nupon causeys into the field for their recreation: for the same field\r\nwas at that time a parish. This postern was re-edified by William\r\nHampton, fishmonger, mayor, in the year 1472. In the year also, 1511,\r\nthe third of Henry VIII., Roger Acheley, mayor, caused dikes and bridges\r\nto be made, and the ground to be levelled, and made more commodious for\r\npassage, since which time the same hath been heightened. So much that\r\nthe ditches and bridges are covered, and seemeth to me that if it be\r\nmade level with the battlements of the city wall, yet will it be little\r\nthe drier, such is the moorish nature of that ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTERN OF CRIPPLEGATE\r\n\r\nThe next is the postern of Cripplegate, so called long before the\r\nConquest. For I read in the history of Edmond,[49] king of the East\r\nAngles, written by Abbo Floriacensis, and by Burchard, sometime\r\nsecretary to Offa, king of Marcia, but since by John Lidgate, monk\r\nof Bury, that in the year 1010, the Danes spoiling the kingdom of\r\nthe East Angles, Alwyne, bishop of Helmeham, caused the body of King\r\nEdmond the Martyr to be brought from Bedrisworth (now called Bury St.\r\nEdmondes), through the kingdom of the East Saxons, and so to London\r\nin at Cripplegate; a place, saith mine author, so called of cripples\r\nbegging there: at which gate, it was said, the body entering, miracles\r\nwere wrought, as some of the lame to go upright, praising God. The body\r\nof King Edmond rested for the space of three years in the parish church\r\nof St. Gregorie, near unto the cathedral church of St. Paul. Moreover,\r\nthe charter of William the Conqueror, confirming the foundation of the\r\ncollege in London, called St. Martin the Great, hath these words:[50] “I\r\ndo give and grant to the same church and canons, serving God therein,\r\nall the land and the moore without the postern, which is called\r\nCripplegate, on either side the postern.” More I read, that Alfune built\r\nthe parish church of St. Giles, nigh a gate of the city, called Porta\r\nContractorum, or Cripplesgate, about the year 1099.\r\n\r\nThis postern was sometime a prison, whereunto such citizens and others,\r\nas were arrested for debt or common trespasses, were committed, as they\r\nbe now, to the compters, which thing appeareth by a writ of Edward I.\r\nin these words: “_Rex vic. London. salutem: ex graui querela B. capt. &\r\ndetent. in prisona nostra de Criples gate pro x. l. quas coram Radulpho\r\nde Sandwico tunc custod. ciuitatis nostræ London. & I. de Blackwell\r\nciuis recognit. debit. etc._” This gate was new built by the brewers\r\nof London in the year 1244, as saith Fabian’s manuscript. Edmond Shaw,\r\ngoldsmith, mayor in the year 1483, at his decease appointed by his\r\ntestament his executors, with the cost of four hundred marks, and the\r\nstuff of the old gate, called Cripplesgate, to build the same gate of\r\nnew, which was performed and done in the year 1491.\r\n\r\n\r\nALDERSGATE\r\n\r\nThe next is Ældresgate, or Aldersgate,[51] so called not of Aldrich or\r\nof Elders, that is to say, ancient men, builders thereof; not of Eldarne\r\ntrees, growing there more abundantly than in other places, as some have\r\nfabled,[51] but for the very antiquity of the gate itself, as being one\r\nof the first four gates of the city, and serving for the northern parts,\r\nas Aldegate for the east; which two gates, being both old gates, are for\r\ndifference sake called, the one Ealdegate, and the other Aldersgate.\r\nThis is the fourth principal gate, and hath at sundry times been\r\nincreased with buildings, namely, on the south, or inner side, a great\r\nframe of timber hath been added and set up, containing divers large\r\nrooms and lodgings; also on the east side is the addition of one great\r\nbuilding of timber, with one large floor, paved with stone or tile, and\r\na well therein curbed with stone, of a great depth, and rising into the\r\nsaid room, two stories high from the ground; which well is the only\r\npeculiar note belonging to that gate, for I have not seen the like in\r\nall this city to be raised so high. John Day, stationer, a late famous\r\nprinter of many good books, in our time dwelt in this gate, and built\r\nmuch upon the wall of the city towards the parish church of St. Anne.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTERN OUT OF CHRIST’S HOSPITAL\r\n\r\nThen is there also a postern gate, made out of the wall on the north\r\nside of the late dissolved cloister of Friers minors, commonly of their\r\nhabit called Grey friars, now Christ’s church and hospital. This postern\r\nwas made in the first year of Edward VI. to pass from the said hospital\r\nof Christ’s church unto the hospital of St. Bartlemew in Smithfield.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEWGATE\r\n\r\nThe next gate on the west, and by north, is termed Newgate, as latelier\r\nbuilt than the rest, and is the fifth principal gate. This gate was\r\nfirst erected about the reign of Henry I. or of King Stephen, upon this\r\noccasion.[52] The cathedral church of St. Paul, being burnt about the\r\nyear 1086, in the reign of William the Conqueror, Mauritius, then bishop\r\nof London, repaired not the old church, as some have supposed, but\r\nbegan the foundation of a new work, such as men then judged would never\r\nhave been performed; it was to them so wonderful for height, length,\r\nand breadth, as also in respect it was raised upon arches or vaults, a\r\nkind of workmanship brought in by the Normans, and never known to the\r\nartificers of this land before that time, etc. After Mauritius, Richard\r\nBeamore did wonderfully advance the work of the said church, purchasing\r\nthe large streets and lanes round about, wherein were wont to dwell many\r\nlay people, which grounds he began to compass about with a strong wall\r\nof stone and gates. By means of this increase of the church territory,\r\nbut more by inclosing of ground for so large a cemetery or churchyard,\r\nthe high and large street stretching from Aldegate in the east until\r\nLudgate in the west, was in this place so crossed and stopped up, that\r\nthe carriage through the city westward was forced to pass without the\r\nsaid churchyard wall on the north side, through Pater noster row; and\r\nthen south, down Ave Mary lane, and again west, through Bowyer row to\r\nLudgate; or else out of Cheepe, or Watheling street, to turn south,\r\nthrough the old Exchange; then west through Carter lane, again north\r\nby Creede lane, and then west to Ludgate: which passage, by reason of\r\nso often turning, was very cumbersome and dangerous both for horse and\r\nman; for remedy whereof a new gate was made, and so called, by which men\r\nand cattle, with all manner of carriages, might pass more directly (as\r\nafore) from Aldegate, through West Cheape by Paules, on the north side;\r\nthrough St. Nicholas shambles and Newgate market to Newgate, and from\r\nthence to any part westward over Oldborne bridge, or turning without\r\nthe gate into Smithfielde, and through Iseldon to any part north and\r\nby west. This gate hath of long time been a gaol, or prison for felons\r\nand trespassers, as appeareth by records[53] in the reign of King John,\r\nand of other kings; amongst the which I find one testifying, that in\r\nthe year 1218, the 3rd of King Henry III., the king writeth unto the\r\nsheriffs of London, commanding them to repair the gaol of Newgate for\r\nthe safe keeping of his prisoners, promising that the charges laid out\r\nshould be allowed unto them upon their account in the Exchequer.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in the year 1241, the Jews of Norwich were hanged for\r\ncircumcising a Christian child; their house called the Thor was pulled\r\ndown and destroyed; Aron, the son of Abraham, a Jew, at London, and\r\nthe other Jews, were constrained to pay twenty thousand marks at two\r\nterms in the year, or else to be kept perpetual prisoners in Newgate of\r\nLondon, and in other prisons. In 1255, King Henry III. lodging in the\r\ntower of London, upon displeasure conceived towards the city of London,\r\nfor the escape of John Offrem, a prisoner, being a clerk convict, out\r\nof Newgate, which had killed a prior that was of alliance to the king,\r\nas cousin to the queen: he sent for the mayor and sheriffs to come\r\nbefore him to answer the matter; the mayor laid the fault from him to\r\nthe sheriffs, forasmuch as to them belonged the keeping of all prisoners\r\nwithin the city; and so the mayor returned home, but the sheriffs\r\nremained there prisoners by the space of a month and more; and yet they\r\nexcused themselves, in that the fault chiefly rested in the bishop’s\r\nofficers; for whereas the prisoner was under custody, they at his\r\nrequest had granted license to imprison the offender within the gaol of\r\nNewgate, but so as the bishop’s officers were charged to see him safely\r\nkept. The king, notwithstanding all this, demanded of the city three\r\nthousand marks for a fine.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1326, Robert Baldoke, the king’s chancellor, was put in\r\nNewgate, the 3rd of Edward III. In the year 1337, Sir John Poultney\r\ngave four marks by the year to the relief of prisoners in Newgate. In\r\nthe year 1385, William Walworth gave somewhat to relieve the prisoners\r\nin Newgate, so have many others since. In the year 1414, the gaolers\r\nof Newgate and Ludgate died, and prisoners in Newgate to the number\r\nof sixty-four. In the year 1418, the parson of Wrotham, in Kent, was\r\nimprisoned in Newgate. In the year 1422, the first of Henry VI., license\r\nwas granted to John Coventre, Jenken Carpenter, and William Grove,\r\nexecutors to Richard Whittington, to re-edify the gaol of Newgate, which\r\nthey did with his goods.\r\n\r\nThomas Knowles, grocer, sometime mayor of London, by license of Reynold,\r\nprior of St. Bartholomew’s in Smithfield, and also of John Wakering,\r\nmaster of the hospital of St. Bartholomew, and his brethren, conveyed\r\nthe waste of water at the cistern near to the common fountain and chapel\r\nof St. Nicholas (situate by the said hospital) to the gaols of Newgate,\r\nand Ludgate, for the relief of the prisoners. Tuesday next after Palm\r\nSunday 1431, all the prisoners of Ludgate were removed into Newgate by\r\nWalter Chartesey, and Robert Large, sheriffs of London; and on the\r\n13th of April the same sheriffs (through the false suggestion of John\r\nKingesell, jailor of Newgate) set from thence eighteen persons free\r\nmen, and these were let to the compters, pinioned as if they had been\r\nfelons; but on the sixteenth of June, Ludgate was again appointed for\r\nfree men, prisoners for debt; and the same day the said free men entered\r\nby ordinance of the mayor, aldermen, and commons, and by them Henry\r\nDeane, tailor, was made keeper of Ludgate prison. In the year 1457, a\r\ngreat fray was in the north country between Sir Thomas Percie, Lord\r\nEgremond, and the Earl of Salisbury’s sons, whereby many were maimed\r\nand slain; but, in the end, the Lord Egremond being taken, was by the\r\nking’s counsel found in great default, and therefore condemned in great\r\nsums of money, to be paid to the Earl of Salisbury, and in the meantime\r\ncommitted to Newgate. Not long after, Sir Thomas Percie, Lord Egremond,\r\nand Sir Richard Percie his brother, being in Newgate, broke out of\r\nprison by night, and went to the king; the other prisoners took the\r\nleads of the gate, and defended it a long while against the sheriffs and\r\nall their officers, insomuch that they were forced to call more aid of\r\nthe citizens, whereby they lastly subdued them, and laid them in irons:\r\nand this may suffice for Newgate.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUDGATE\r\n\r\nIn the west is the next, and sixth principal gate, and is called\r\nLudgate, as first built (saith Geoffrey Monmouth) by King Lud, a Briton,\r\nabout the year before Christ’s nativity, 66. Of which building, and also\r\nof the name, as Ludsgate, or Fludsgate, hath been of late some question\r\namong the learned; wherefore I overpass it, as not to my purpose, only\r\nreferring the reader to that I have before written out of Cæsar’s\r\nCommentaries, and other Roman writers, concerning a town or city amongst\r\nthe Britons. This gate I suppose to be one of the most ancient; and as\r\nAldgate was built for the east, so was this Ludsgate for the west. I\r\nread,[54] as I told you, that in the year 1215, the 17th of King John,\r\nthe barons of the realm, being in arms against the king, entered this\r\ncity, and spoiled the Jews’ houses; which being done, Robert Fitzwater\r\nand Geffrey de Magnavilla, Earl of Essex, and the Earl of Gloucester,\r\nchief leaders of the army, applied all diligence to repair the gates\r\nand walls of this city, with the stones of the Jews’ broken houses,\r\nespecially (as it seemeth) they then repaired, or rather new built\r\nLudgate. For in the year 1586, when the same gate was taken down to\r\nbe newly built, there was found couched within the wall thereof a\r\nstone taken from one of the Jews’ houses, wherein was graven in Hebrew\r\ncharacters these words following: _Hæc est statio Rabbi Mosis, filii\r\ninsignis Rabbi Isaac_: which is to say, this is the station or ward\r\nof Rabbi Moyses, the son of the honourable Rabbi Isaac, and had been\r\nfixed upon the front of one of the Jews’ houses, as a note or sign that\r\nsuch a one dwelt there. In the year 1260, this Ludgate was repaired,\r\nand beautified with images of Lud, and other kings, as appeareth by\r\nletters patent of license given to the citizens of London, to take up\r\nstone for that purpose, dated the 25th of Henry III. These images of\r\nkings in the reign of Edward VI. had their heads smitten off, and were\r\notherwise defaced by[55] such as judged every image to be an idol; and\r\nin the reign of Queen Mary were repaired, as by setting new heads on\r\ntheir old bodies, etc. All which so remained until the year 1586, the\r\n28th of Queen Elizabeth, when the same gate being sore decayed, was\r\nclean taken down; the prisoners in the meantime remaining in the large\r\nsouth-east quadrant to the same gate adjoining; and the same year the\r\nwhole gate was newly and beautifully built, with the images of Lud and\r\nothers, as afore, on the east side, and the picture of her majesty Queen\r\nElizabeth on the west side: all which was done at the common charges of\r\nthe citizens, amounting to fifteen hundred pounds or more.\r\n\r\nThis gate was made a free prison in the year 1378, the 1st of Richard\r\nII., Nicholas Brembar being mayor.[56] The same was confirmed in the\r\nyear 1382, John Northampton being mayor, by a common council in the\r\nGuildhall; by which it was ordained that all freemen of this city\r\nshould, for debt, trespasses, accounts, and contempts, be imprisoned\r\nin Ludgate, and for treasons, felonies, and other criminal offences,\r\ncommitted to Newgate, etc. In the year 1431, the 10th of King Henry VI.,\r\nJohn Wells being mayor, a court of common council established ordinances\r\n(as William Standon and Robert Chicheley, late mayors, before had done),\r\ntouching the guard and government of Ludgate and other prisons.\r\n\r\nAlso in the year 1463, the third of Edward IV., Mathew Philip, being\r\nmayor, in a common council, at the request of the well-disposed,\r\nblessed, and devout woman, Dame Agnes Forster, widow, late wife to\r\nStephen Forster, fishmonger, sometime mayor, for the comfort and relief\r\nof all the poor prisoners, certain articles were established. Imprimis,\r\nthat the new works then late edified by the same Dame Agnes, for the\r\nenlarging of the prison of Ludgate, from thenceforth should be had and\r\ntaken as a part and parcel of the said prison of Ludgate; so that both\r\nthe old and new work of Ludgate aforesaid be one prison, gaol keeping,\r\nand charge for evermore.\r\n\r\nThe said quadrant, strongly built of stone by the beforenamed Stephen\r\nForster, and Agnes his wife, containeth a large walking-place by ground\r\nof thirty-eight feet and a half in length, besides the thickness of the\r\nwalls, which are at the least six foot, makes altogether forty-four\r\nfeet and a half; the breadth within the walls is twenty-nine feet and a\r\nhalf, so that the thickness of the walls maketh it thirty five feet and\r\na half in breadth. The like room it hath over it for lodgings, and over\r\nit again fair leads to walk upon, well embattled, all for fresh air and\r\nease of prisoners, to the end they should have lodging and water free\r\nwithout charge, as by certain verses graven in copper, and fixed on the\r\nsaid quadrant, I have read in form following:--\r\n\r\n    “Devout souls that pass this way,\r\n    For Stephen Forster, late mayor, heartily pray;\r\n    And Dame Agnes his spouse to God consecrate,\r\n    That of pity this house made for Londoners in Ludgate.\r\n    So that for lodging and water prisoners here nought pay,\r\n    As their keepers shall all answer at dreadful doomsday.”\r\n\r\nThis place and one other of his arms, three broad arrow-heads, taken\r\ndown with the old gate, I caused to be fixed over the entry of the said\r\nquadrant; but the verses being unhappily turned inward to the wall,\r\nprocured the like in effect to be graven outward in prose, declaring him\r\nto be a fishmonger, because some upon a light occasion (as a maiden’s\r\nhead in a glass window) had fabled him to be a mercer, and to have\r\nbegged there at Ludgate, etc. Thus much for Ludgate.\r\n\r\nNext this is there a breach in the wall of the city, and a bridge of\r\ntimber over the Fleet dike, betwixt Fleetebridge and Thames, directly\r\nover against the house of Bridewel. Thus much for gates in the wall.\r\n\r\nWater-gates on the banks of the river Thames have been many, which being\r\npurchased by private men, are also put to private use, and the old names\r\nof them forgotten; but of such as remain, from the west towards the\r\neast, may be said as followeth:--\r\n\r\nThe Blacke-friers stairs, a free landing-place.\r\n\r\nThen a water-gate at Puddle wharf, of one Puddle that kept a wharf on\r\nthe west side thereof, and now of Puddle water, by means of many horses\r\nwatered there.\r\n\r\nThen Powle’s wharf, also a free landing-place with stairs, etc.\r\n\r\nThen Broken wharf, and other such like.\r\n\r\nBut, Ripa Regina, the Queene’s bank, or Queene hithe may well be\r\naccounted the very chief and principal water-gate of this city, being\r\na common strand or landing-place, yet equal with, and of old time far\r\nexceeding, Belins gate, as shall be shown in the ward of Queene hithe.\r\n\r\nThe next is Downe gate, so called of the sudden descending or down-going\r\nof that way from St. John’s church upon Walbrooke unto the river of\r\nThames, whereby the water in the channel there hath such a swift course,\r\nthat in the year 1574, on the fourth of September, after a strong shower\r\nof rain, a lad, of the age of eighteen years, minding to have leapt over\r\nthe channel, was taken by the feet, and borne down with the violence of\r\nthat narrow stream, and carried toward the Thames with such a violent\r\nswiftness, as no man could rescue or stay him, till he came against\r\na cart-wheel that stood in the water-gate, before which time he was\r\ndrowned and stark dead.\r\n\r\nThis was sometimes a large water-gate, frequented of ships and other\r\nvessels, like as the Queene hithe, and was a part thereof, as doth\r\nappear by an inquisition made in the 28th year of Henry III., wherein\r\nwas found, that as well corn as fish, and all other things coming to the\r\nport of Downegate, were to be ordered after the customs of the Queene’s\r\nhithe, for the king’s use; as also that the corn arriving between the\r\ngate of the Guild hall of the merchants of Cullen (the Styleyard), which\r\nis east from Downegate, and the house then pertaining to the Archbishop\r\nof Canterbury, west from Baynarde’s Castle, was to be measured by the\r\nmeasure, and measurer of the Queene’s soke, or Queene hithe. I read\r\nalso, in the 19th of Edward III., that customs were then to be paid for\r\nships and other vessels resting at Downegate, as if they rode at Queene\r\nhithe, and as they now do at Belingsgate. And thus much for Downegate\r\nmay suffice.\r\n\r\nThe next was called Wolfes gate,[57] in the ropery in the parish of\r\nAllhallowes the Lesse, of later time called Wolfes lane, but now out of\r\nuse; for the lower part was built on by the Earle of Shrewsburie, and\r\nthe other part was stopped up and built on by the chamberlain of London.\r\n\r\nThe next is Ebgate,[58] a water-gate, so called of old time, as\r\nappeareth by divers records of tenements near unto the same adjoining.\r\nIt standeth near unto the church of St. Laurence Pountney, but is within\r\nthe parish of St. Marten Ordegare. In place of this gate is now a narrow\r\npassage to the Thames, and is called Ebgate lane, but more commonly the\r\nOld Swan.\r\n\r\nThen is there a water-gate at the bridge foot, called Oyster gate, of\r\noysters that were there of old time, commonly to be sold, and was the\r\nchiefest market for them and for other shell-fishes. There standeth now\r\nan engine or forcier, for the winding up of water to serve the city,\r\nwhereof I have already spoken.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIDGE GATE\r\n\r\nThe next is the Bridge gate, so called of London Bridge, whereon it\r\nstandeth. This was one of the four first and principal gates of the\r\ncity, long before the Conquest, when there stood a bridge of timber,\r\nand is the seventh and last principal gate mentioned by W. Fitzstephen;\r\nwhich gate being new[59] made, when the bridge was built was built\r\nof stone, hath been oftentimes since repaired. This gate, with the\r\ntower upon it, in the year 1436 fell down, and two of the farthest\r\narches southwards also fell therewith, and no man perished or was hurt\r\ntherewith. To the repairing whereof, divers wealthy citizens gave large\r\nsums of money; namely, Robert Large, sometime mayor, one hundred marks;\r\nStephen Forster, twenty pounds; Sir John Crosbye, alderman, one hundred\r\npounds, etc. But in the year 1471,[60] the Kentish mariners, under the\r\nconduct of bastard Fauconbridge, burned the said gate and thirteen\r\nhouses on the bridge, besides the Beer houses at St. Katherine’s, and\r\nmany others in the suburbs.\r\n\r\nThe next is Buttolphe’s gate, so called of the parish church of St.\r\nButtolph, near adjoining. This gate was sometimes given or confirmed\r\nby William Conqueror to the monks of Westminster in these words: “W.\r\nrex Angliæ, etc., William, king of England, sendeth greeting to the\r\nsheriffes, and all his ministers, as also to all his loving subjects,\r\nFrench and English, of London: Know ye that I have granted to God and\r\nSt. Peter of Westminster, and to the abbot Vitalis, the gift which\r\nAlmundus of the port of S. Buttolph gave them, when he was there made\r\nmonke: that is to say, his Lords court with the houses, and one wharf,\r\nwhich is at the head of London bridge, and all other his lands which he\r\nhad in the same city, in such sort as King Edward more beneficially and\r\namply granted the same; and I will and command that they shall enjoy\r\nthe same well and quietly and honourably, with sake and soke, etc.”\r\n\r\nThe next is Bellinsgate, used as an especial port, or harbour, for small\r\nships and boats coming thereto, and is now[61] most frequented, the\r\nQueen’s hithe being almost forsaken. How this gate took that name, or of\r\nwhat antiquity the same is, I must leave uncertain, as not having any\r\nancient record thereof, more than that Geoffrey Monmouth writeth, that\r\nBelin, a king of the Britons, about four hundred years before Christ’s\r\nnativity, built this gate, and named it Belin’s gate, after his own\r\ncalling; and that when he was dead, his body being burnt, the ashes, in\r\na vessel of brass, were set upon a high pinnacle of stone over the same\r\ngate. But Cæsar and other Roman writers affirm, of cities, walls, and\r\ngates, as ye have before heard; and therefore it seemeth to me not to be\r\nso ancient, but rather to have taken that name of some later owner of\r\nthe place, happily named Beling, or Biling, as Somar’s key, Smart’s key,\r\nFrosh wharf, and others, thereby took their names of their owners. Of\r\nthis gate more shall be said when we come to Belin’s gate ward.\r\n\r\nThen have you a water-gate, on the west side of Wool wharf, or\r\nCustomers’ key,[62] which is commonly called the water-gate, at the\r\nsouth end of Water lane.\r\n\r\nOne other water-gate there is by the bulwark of the Tower, and this is\r\nthe last and farthest water-gate eastward, on the river of Thames, so\r\nfar as the city of London extendeth within the walls; both which last\r\nnamed water-gates be within the Tower ward.\r\n\r\nBesides these common water-gates, were divers private wharfs and\r\nkeys, all along from the east to the west of this city, on the bank\r\nof the river of Thames; merchants of all nations had landing-places,\r\nwarehouses, cellars, and stowage of their goods and merchandises, as\r\npartly shall be touched in the wards adjoining to the said river. Now,\r\nfor the ordering and keeping these gates of this city in the night time,\r\nit was appointed in the year of Christ 1258, by Henry III., the 42nd of\r\nhis reign,[63] that the ports of England should be strongly kept, and\r\nthat the gates of London should be new repaired, and diligently kept in\r\nthe night, for fear of French deceits, whereof one writeth these verses:\r\n\r\n    “Per noctem portæ clauduntur Londoniarum,\r\n    Mœnia ne forte fraus frangat Francigenarum.”\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[40] “Which then served as a posterne for passengers out of the east,\r\nfrom thence through Tower street, East cheape, and Candlewecke street\r\nto London Stone, the middle point of that highway, then through Budge\r\nrow, Watheling street, and leaving Paul’s church on the right hand,\r\nto Ludgate in the west; the next be Aldgate, Bishopsgate, Criplegate,\r\nAldersgate, Ludgate, and the Bridgegate over the Thames. Since the which\r\ntime hath been builded Newgate,” etc.--_1st edition_, p. 25.\r\n\r\n[41] “Was never re-edified againe of stone, but an homely cottage, with\r\na narrow passage made of timber, lath and loame, hath beene in place\r\nthereof set up, and so remaineth.”--_1st edition_, p. 25.\r\n\r\n[42] Liber Trinitat.\r\n\r\n[43] Matthew Paris.\r\n\r\n[44] Radul.

In the west part are two most strong castles, etc.” To begin\r\ntherefore with the most famous Tower of London, situate in the east,\r\nnear unto the river of Thames: it hath been the common opinion, and\r\nsome have written (but of none assured ground), that Julius Cæsar, the\r\nfirst conqueror of the Britons, was the original author and founder, as\r\nwell thereof as also of many other towers, castles, and great buildings\r\nwithin this realm; but (as I have already before noted) Cæsar remained\r\nnot here so long, nor had he in his head any such matter, but only to\r\ndispatch a conquest of this barbarous country, and to proceed to greater\r\nmatters. Neither do the Roman writers make mention of any such buildings\r\ncreated by him here; and therefore leaving this, and proceeding to\r\nmore grounded authority, I find in a fair register-book, containing\r\nthe acts of the Bishops of Rochester, set down by Edmond de Hadenham,\r\nthat William I., surnamed Conqueror, built the Tower of London; to wit,\r\nthe great white and square tower there, about the year of Christ 1078,\r\nappointing Gundulph, then Bishop of Rochester, to be principal surveyor\r\nand overseer of that work, who was for that time lodged in the house of\r\nEdmere, a burgess of London; the very words of which mine author are\r\nthese: “_Gundulphus Episcopus mandato Willielmi Regis magni præfuit\r\noperi magnæ Turris London. quo tempore hospitatus est apud quendam\r\nEdmerum Burgensem London. qui dedit unum_ were _Ecclesiæ Rofen._”\r\n\r\nYe have before heard that the wall of this city was all round about\r\nfurnished with towers and bulwarks, in due distance every one from\r\nother; and also that the river Thames, with his ebbing and flowing, on\r\nthe south side, had subverted the said wall and towers there. Wherefore\r\nKing William, for defence of this city, in place most dangerous, and\r\nopen to the enemy, having taken down the second bulwark in the east\r\npart of the wall from the Thames, built this tower, which was the great\r\nsquare tower, now called the White Tower, and hath been since at divers\r\ntimes enlarged with other buildings adjoining, as shall be shown. This\r\ntower was by tempest of wind[64] sore shaken in the year 1090, the 4th\r\nof William Rufus, and was again by the said Rufus and Henry I. repaired.\r\nThey also caused a castle to be built under the said tower, namely, on\r\nthe south side towards the Thames, and also incastellated the same round\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nHenry Huntingdon, libro sexto, hath these words: “William Rufus\r\nchallenged the investure of prelates; he pilled and shaved the people\r\nwith tribute, especially to spend about the Tower of London, and the\r\ngreat hall at Westminster.”\r\n\r\nOthowerus, Acolinillus, Otto, and Geffrey Magnaville, Earl of Essex,\r\nwere four the first constables of this Tower of London, by succession;\r\nall which held by force a portion of land (that pertained to the priory\r\nof the Holy Trinitie within Aldgate); that is to say, East Smithfield,\r\nnear unto the Tower, making thereof a vineyard,[65] and would not depart\r\nfrom it till the 2nd year of King Stephen, when the same was abridged\r\nand restored to the church. This said Geffrey Magnaville was Earl of\r\nEssex, constable of the Tower, sheriff of London, Middlesex, Essex, and\r\nHertfordshire, as appeareth by a charter of Maud the empress, dated\r\n1141. He also fortified the Tower of London against King Stephen; but\r\nthe king took him in his court at St. Albones, and would not deliver him\r\ntill he had rendered the Tower of London, with the castles of Walden and\r\nPlashey in Essex. In the year 1153 the Tower of London and the castle\r\nof Windsor were by the king delivered to Richard de Lucie, to be safely\r\nkept. In the year 1155, Thomas Becket being chancellor to Henry II.,\r\ncaused the Flemings to be banished out of England,[66] their castles\r\nlately built to be pulled down, and the Tower of London to be repaired.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1190, the 2nd of Richard I., William Longshampe, Bishop\r\nof Elie, Chancellor of England, for cause of dissension betwixt him and\r\nEarl John, the king’s brother that was rebel, inclosed the tower and\r\ncastle of London, with an outward wall of stone embattled, and also\r\ncaused a deep ditch to be cast about the same, thinking (as I have\r\nsaid before) to have environed it with the river of Thames. By the\r\nmaking of this inclosure and ditch in East Smithfield, the church of\r\nthe Holy Trinitie in London lost half a mark rent by the year, and the\r\nmill was removed that belonged to the poor brethren of the hospital of\r\nSt. Katherine,[67] and to the church of the Holy Trinitie aforesaid,\r\nwhich was no small loss and discommodity to either part; and the garden\r\nwhich the king had hired of the brethren for six marks the year, for\r\nthe most part was wasted and marred by the ditch. Recompense was often\r\npromised, but never performed, until King Edward coming after, gave to\r\nthe brethren five marks and a half for that part which the ditch had\r\ndevoured, and the other part thereof without he yielded to them again,\r\nwhich they hold: and of the said rent of five marks and a half, they\r\nhave a deed, by virtue whereof they are well paid to this day.\r\n\r\nIt is also to be noted, and cannot be denied, but that the said\r\ninclosure and ditch took the like or greater quantity of ground from the\r\ncity within the wall; namely, one of that part called the Tower Hill,\r\nbesides breaking down of the city wall, from the White Tower to the\r\nfirst gate of the city, called the Postern; yet have I not read of any\r\nquarrel made by the citizens, or recompense demanded by them for that\r\nmatter, because all was done for good of the city’s defence thereof,\r\nand to their good likings. But Matthew Paris writeth, that in the year\r\n1239, King Henry III. fortified the Tower of London to another end;\r\nwherefore the citizens, fearing lest that were done to their detriment,\r\ncomplained, and the king answered, that he had not done it to their\r\nhurt, but (saith he) I will from henceforth do as my brother doth, in\r\nbuilding and fortifying castles, who beareth the name to be wiser than\r\nI am. It followed in the next year, saith mine author, the said noble\r\nbuildings of the stone gate and bulwark, which the king had caused to\r\nbe made by the Tower of London, on the west side thereof, were shaken\r\nas it had been with an earthquake, and fell down, which the king again\r\ncommanded to be built in better sort than before, which was done; and\r\nyet again, in the year 1247, the said wall and bulwarks that were newly\r\nbuilt, wherein the king had bestowed more than twelve thousand marks,\r\nwere irrecoverably thrown down, as afore; for the which chance the\r\ncitizens of London were nothing sorry, for they were threatened that\r\nthe said wall and bulwarks were built, to the end that if any of them\r\nwould contend for the liberties of the city, they might be imprisoned;\r\nand that many might be laid in divers prisons, many lodgings were made\r\nthat no one should speak with another: thus much Matthew Paris for\r\nthis building. More of Henry III., his dealings against the citizens\r\nof London, we may read in the said author, in 1245, 1248, 1249, 1253,\r\n1255, 1256, etc. But, concerning the said wall and bulwark, the same\r\nwas finished, though not in his time; for I read that Edward I., in\r\nthe second of his reign, commanded the treasurer and chamberlain of\r\nthe Exchequer to deliver out of his treasury unto Miles of Andwarp two\r\nhundred marks, of the fines taken out of divers merchants or usurers\r\nof London, for so be the words of the record, towards the work of the\r\nditch then new made, about the said bulwark, now called the Lion Tower.\r\nI find also recorded, that Henry III., in the 46th of his reign, wrote\r\nto Edward of Westminster, commanding him that he should buy certain\r\nperie plants, and set the same in the place without his Tower of London,\r\nwithin the wall of the said city, which of late he had caused to be\r\ninclosed with a mud wall, as may appear by this that followeth: the\r\nmayor and commonalty of London were fined for throwing down the said\r\nearthen wall against the Tower of London, the 9th of Edward II. Edward\r\nIV. in place thereof built a wall of brick. But now for the Lion Tower\r\nand lions in England, the original, as I have read, was thus.\r\n\r\nHenry I. built his manor of Wodstock, with a park, which he walled about\r\nwith stone, seven miles in compass, destroying for the same divers\r\nvillages, churches, and chapels; and this was the first park in England.\r\nHe placed therein, besides great store of deer, divers strange beasts to\r\nbe kept and nourished, such as were brought to him from far countries,\r\nas lions, leopards, linces, porpentines,[68] and such other. More I\r\nread, that in the year 1235, Frederick the emperor sent to Henry III.\r\nthree leopards, in token of his regal shield of arms, wherein three\r\nleopards were pictured; since the which time those lions and others have\r\nbeen kept in a part of this bulwark, now called the Lion Tower, and\r\ntheir keepers there lodged. King Edward II., in the 12th of his reign,\r\ncommanded the sheriffs of London to pay to the keepers of the king’s\r\nleopard in the Tower of London sixpence the day for the sustenance of\r\nthe leopard, and three-halfpence a day for diet for the said keeper, out\r\nof the fee farm of the said city. More, in the 16th of Edward III., one\r\nlion, one lioness, one leopard, and two cat lions, in the said Tower,\r\nwere committed to the custody of Robert, the son of John Bowre.\r\n\r\nEdward IV. fortified the Tower of London, and inclosed with brick, as\r\nis aforesaid, a certain piece of ground, taken out of the Tower Hill,\r\nwest from the Lion Tower, now called the bulwark. His officers also, in\r\nthe 5th of his reign, set upon the said hill both scaffold and gallows,\r\nfor the execution of offenders; whereupon the mayor and his brethren\r\ncomplained to the king, and were answered that the same was not done in\r\nderogation of the city’s liberties, and thereof caused proclamation to\r\nbe made, etc., as shall be shown in Tower street.\r\n\r\nRichard III., repaired and built in this tower somewhat. Henry VIII.,\r\nin 1532, repaired the White Tower, and other parts thereof. In the year\r\n1548, the 2nd of Edward VI., on the 22nd of November, in the night, a\r\nFrenchman lodged in the round bulwark, betwixt the west gate and the\r\npostern, or drawbridge, called the warders’ gate, by setting fire on a\r\nbarrel of gunpowder, blew up the said bulwark, burnt himself, and no\r\nmore persons. This bulwark, was forthwith again new built.\r\n\r\nAnd here, because I have by occasion spoken of the west gate of this\r\ntower the same, as the most principal, is used for the receipt and\r\ndelivery of all kinds of carriages, without the which gate divers\r\nbulwarks and gates, towards the north, etc. Then near within this west\r\ngate, opening to the south, is a strong postern for passengers by the\r\nward-house, over a drawbridge let down for that purpose. Next on the\r\nsame south side, toward the east, is a large water-gate, for receipt\r\nof boats and small vessels, partly under a stone bridge from the river\r\nof Thames. Beyond it is a small postern, with a drawbridge, seldom let\r\ndown but for the receipt of some great persons, prisoners. Then towards\r\nthe east is a great and strong gate, commonly called the Iron gate, but\r\nnot usually opened. And thus much for the foundation, building, and\r\nrepairing of this tower, with the gates and posterns, may suffice. And\r\nnow somewhat of accidents in the same shall be shown.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1196, William Fitzosbert, a citizen of London, seditiously\r\nmoving the common people to seek liberty, and not to be subject to\r\nthe rich and more mighty, at length was taken and brought before the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury in the Tower, where he was by the judges\r\ncondemned, and by the heels drawn thence to the Elms in Smithfield, and\r\nthere hanged.\r\n\r\nIn 1214, King John[69] wrote to Geffrey Magnaville to deliver the Tower\r\nof London, with the prisoners, armour, and all other things found\r\ntherein belonging to the king, to William, archdeacon of Huntingdon. In\r\nthe year 1216, the 1st of Henry III., the said Tower was delivered to\r\nLewis of France and the barons of England.[70]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1206 pleas of the crown were pleaded in the Tower; likewise\r\nin the year 1220, and likewise in the year 1224, and again in the year\r\n1243, before William of Yorke, Richard Passelew, Henry Brahe, Jerome of\r\nSaxton, justices.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1222, the citizens of London having made a tumult against\r\nthe abbot of Westminster, Hubert of Burge, chief justice of England,\r\ncame to the Tower of London, called before him the mayor and aldermen,\r\nof whom he inquired for the principal authors of that sedition; amongst\r\nwhom one, named Constantine Fitz Aelulfe, avowed that he was the man,\r\nand had done much less than he ought to have done: whereupon the justice\r\nsent him with two other to Falks de Brent, who with armed men brought\r\nthem to the gallows, where they were hanged.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1244, Griffith, the eldest son of Leoline, Prince of Wales,\r\nbeing kept prisoner in the Tower, devised means of escape, and having\r\nin the night made of the hangings, sheets, etc., a long line, he put\r\nhimself down from the top of the Tower, but in the sliding, the weight\r\nof his body, being a very big and a fat man, brake the rope, and he fell\r\nand brake his neck withall.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1253, King Henry III. imprisoned the sheriffs of London\r\nin the Tower more than a month, for the escape of a prisoner out of\r\nNewgate, as you may read in the chapter of Gates.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1260, King Henry, with his queen (for fear of the barons),\r\nwere lodged in the Tower. The next year he sent for his lords, and held\r\nhis parliament there.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1263, when the queen would have removed from the Tower by\r\nwater towards Windsor, sundry Londoners got them together to the bridge,\r\nunder the which she was to pass, and not only cried out upon her with\r\nreproachful words, but also threw mire and stones at her, by which she\r\nwas constrained to return for the time; but in the year 1265, the said\r\ncitizens were fain to submit themselves to the king for it, and the\r\nmayor, aldermen, and sheriffs were sent to divers prisons, and a custos\r\nalso was set over the city; to wit, Othon, constable of the Tower, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1282, Leoline, prince of Wales, being taken at Bewlth\r\ncastle, Roger Lestrange cut off his head, which Sir Roger Mortimer\r\ncaused to be crowned with ivy, and set it upon the Tower of London.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1290, divers justices, as well of the bench as of the\r\nassizes, were sent prisoners to the Tower, which with great sums of\r\nmoney redeemed their liberty. Edward II., the 14th of his reign,\r\nappointed for prisoners in the Tower, a knight twopence the day, an\r\nesquire one penny the day, to serve for their diet.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1320, the king’s justices sat in the Tower, for trial of\r\nmatters; whereupon John Gifors, late mayor of London, and many others,\r\nfled the city, for fear to be charged of things they had presumptuously\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1321, the Mortimers yielding themselves to the king, he sent\r\nthem prisoners to the Tower, where they remained long, and were adjudged\r\nto be drawn and hanged. But at length Roger Mortimer, of Wigmore, by\r\ngiving to his keepers a sleepy drink, escaped out of the Tower, and his\r\nuncle Roger, being still kept there, died about five years after.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1326, the citizens of London won the Tower, wresting the\r\nkeys out of the constable’s hands, delivered all the prisoners, and kept\r\nboth city and Tower to the use of Isabel the queen, and Edward her son.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1330, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March, was taken and brought\r\nto the Tower, from whence he was brought to the Elms, and there hanged.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1344, King Edward III., in the 18th of his reign, commanded\r\nflorences of gold to be made and coined in the Tower; that is to say,\r\na penny piece of the value of five shillings and eight pence, the\r\nhalfpenny piece of the value of three shillings and four pence, and a\r\nfarthing piece worth twenty pence; Percevall de Port of Lake being then\r\nmaster of the coin. And this is the first coining of gold in the Tower,\r\nwhereof I have read, and also the first coinage of gold in England.\r\nI find also recorded, that the said king in the same year ordained\r\nhis exchange of money to be kept in Serne’s Tower, a part of the\r\nking’s house in Bucklesbury. And here to digress a little (by occasion\r\noffered), I find that, in times before passed, all great sums were paid\r\nby weight of gold or silver, as so many pounds or marks of silver, or\r\nso many pounds or marks of gold, cut into blanks, and not stamped, as I\r\ncould prove by many good authorities which I overpass. The smaller sums\r\nalso were paid in starlings, which were pence so called, for other coins\r\nthey had none. The antiquity of this starling penny usual in this realm\r\nis from the reign of Henry II., notwithstanding the Saxon coins before\r\nthe Conquest were pence of fine silver the full weight, and somewhat\r\nbetter than the latter starlings, as I have tried by conference of the\r\npence of Burghrede, king of Mercia, Aelfred, Edward, and Edelred, kings\r\nof the West Saxons, Plegmond, Archbishop of Canterbury, and others.\r\nWilliam the Conqueror’s penny also was fine silver of the weight of\r\nthe easterling, and had on the one side stamped an armed head, with a\r\nbeardless face,--for the Normans wore no beards,--with a sceptre in his\r\nhand. The inscription in the circumference was this: “Le Rei Wilam;”[71]\r\non the other side, a cross double to the ring, between four rowals of\r\nsix points.\r\n\r\nKing Henry I. his penny was of the like weight, fineness, form of face,\r\ncross, etc.\r\n\r\nThis Henry, in the 8th year of his reign, ordained the penny, which was\r\nround, so to be quartered by the cross, that they might easily be broken\r\ninto halfpence and farthings.[72] In the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th of\r\nKing Richard I. his reign, and afterwards, I find commonly easterling\r\nmoney mentioned, and yet ofttimes the same is called argent, as afore,\r\nand not otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe first great sum that I read of to be paid in easterlings was in the\r\nreign of Richard I., when Robert, Earl of Leicester, being prisoner\r\nin France, proffered for his ransom a thousand marks easterlings,\r\nnotwithstanding the easterling pence were long before. The weight of the\r\neasterling penny may appear by divers statutes, namely, of weights and\r\nmeasures, made in the 51st of Henry III. in these words: “Thirty-two\r\ngraines of wheat, drie and round, taken in the middest of the eare,\r\nshoulde be the weight of a starling penie, 20 of those pence should\r\nwaye one ounce, 12 ounces a pound Troy.” It followeth in the statute\r\neight pound to make a gallon of wine, and eight gallons a bushel of\r\nLondon measure, etc. Notwithstanding which statute, I find, in the 8th\r\nof Edward I., Gregorie Rokesley, mayor of London, being chief master\r\nor minister of the Kinge’s Exchange, or mintes, a new coin being then\r\nappointed, the pound of easterling money should contain as afore twelve\r\nounces; to wit, fine silver, such as was then made into foil, and\r\nwas commonly called silver of Guthurons lane,[73] eleven ounces, two\r\neasterlings, and one ferling or farthing, and the other seventeen pence\r\nob. q.[74] to be alloy. Also, the pound of money ought to weigh twenty\r\nshillings and three pence by account; so that no pound ought to be\r\nover twenty shillings and three pence, nor less than twenty shillings\r\nand two pence by account; the ounce to weigh twenty pence, the penny\r\nweight twenty-four grains (which twenty-four by weight then appointed\r\nwere as much as the former thirty-two grains of wheat), a penny force\r\ntwenty-five grains and a half, the penny deble or feeble twenty-two\r\ngrains and a half, etc.[75]\r\n\r\nNow for the penny easterling, how it took that name I think good briefly\r\nto touch. It hath been said, that Numa Pompilius, the second king of the\r\nRomans, commanded money first to be made, of whose name they were called\r\n_nummi_; and when copper pence, silver pence, and gold pence, were made,\r\nbecause every silver penny was worth ten copper pence, and every gold\r\npenny worth ten silver pence, the pence therefore were called in Latin,\r\ndenarii, and oftentimes the pence are named of the matter and stuff of\r\ngold or silver. But the money of England was called of the workers and\r\nmakers thereof; as the florin of gold is called of the Florentines, that\r\nwere the workers thereof, and so the easterling pence took their name of\r\nthe Easterlings which did first make this money in England, in the reign\r\nof Henry II.\r\n\r\nThus have I set down according to my reading in antiquity of money\r\nmatters, omitting the imaginations of late writers, of whom some have\r\nsaid easterling money to take that name of a star, stamped in the border\r\nor ring of the penny; other some of a bird called a star or starling\r\nstamped in the circumference; and other (more unlikely) of being coined\r\nat Strivelin or Starling, a town in Scotland, etc.\r\n\r\nNow concerning halfpence and farthings, the account of which is more\r\nsubtle than the pence, I need not speak of them more than that they were\r\nonly made in the Exchange at London, and nowhere else: first appointed\r\nto be made by Edward I. in the 8th of his reign; and also at the same\r\ntime the said king coined some few groats of silver, but they were not\r\nusual. The king’s Exchange as London was near unto the cathedral church\r\nof St. Paul, and is to this day commonly called the Old Change, but in\r\nevidences the Old Exchange.\r\n\r\nThe king’s exchanger in this place was to deliver out to every other\r\nexchanger throughout England, or other the king’s dominions, their\r\ncoining irons, that is to say, one standard or staple, and two trussels\r\nor puncheons; and when the same was spent and worn, to receive them\r\nwith an account what sum had been coined, and also their pix or bore\r\nof assay, and deliver other irons new graven, etc. I find that in the\r\n9th of King John, there was besides the mint at London, other mints\r\nat Winchester, Excester, Chichester, Canterburie, Rochester, Ipswich,\r\nNorwich, Linne, Lincolne, York, Carleil, Northampton, Oxford, St.\r\nEdmondsbury, and Durham. The exchanger, examiner, and trier, buyeth the\r\nsilver for coinage, answering for every hundred pounds of silver bought\r\nin bullion or otherwise, ninety-eight pounds fifteen shillings, for he\r\ntaketh twenty-five shillings for coinage.\r\n\r\nKing Edward I., in the 27th of his reign, held a parliament at\r\nStebenheth, in the house of Henry Waleis, mayor of London, wherein\r\namongst other things there handled, the transporting of sterling money\r\nwas forbidden.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1351, William Edington, bishop of Winchester, and treasurer\r\nof England, a wise man, but loving the king’s commodity more than the\r\nwealth of the whole realm, and common people (saith mine author[76])\r\ncaused a new coin, called a groat, and a half-groat, to be coined and\r\nstamped, the groat to be taken for four pence, and the half-groat for\r\ntwo pence, not containing in weight according to the pence called\r\neasterlings, but much less, to wit, by five shillings in the pound; by\r\nreason whereof, victuals and merchandises became the dearer through the\r\nwhole realm. About the same time also, the old coin of gold was changed\r\ninto a new; but the old florin or noble, then so called, was worth much\r\nabove the taxed rate of the new, and therefore the merchants engrossed\r\nup the old, and conveyed them out of the realm, to the great loss of the\r\nkingdom. Wherefore a remedy was provided by changing of the stamp.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1411, King Henry IV. caused a new coin of nobles to be made,\r\nof less value than the old by four pence in the noble, so that fifty\r\nnobles should be a pound troy weight.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1421 was granted to Henry V. a fifteenth, to be paid at\r\nCandlemas and at Martinmas, of such money as was then current, gold or\r\nsilver, not overmuch clipped or washed; to wit, that if the noble were\r\nworth five shillings and eight pence, then the king should take it for\r\na full noble of six shillings and eight pence, and if it were less of\r\nvalue than five shillings and eight pence, then the person paying that\r\ngold to make it good to the value of five shillings and eight pence,\r\nthe king always receiving it for a whole noble of six shillings and\r\neight pence. And if the noble so paid be better than five shillings and\r\neight pence, the king to pay again the surplusage that it was better\r\nthan five shillings and eight pence. Also this year was such scarcity of\r\nwhite money, that though a noble were so good of gold and weight as six\r\nshillings and eight pence, men might get no white money for them.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1465, King Edward IV. caused a new coin both of gold and\r\nsilver to be made, whereby he gained much; for he made of an old noble\r\na royal, which he commanded to go for ten shillings. Nevertheless,\r\nto the same royal was put eight pence of alloy, and so weighed the\r\nmore, being smitten with a new stamp, to wit, a rose. He likewise made\r\nhalf-angels of five shillings, and farthings of two shillings and six\r\npence, angelets of six shillings and eight pence, and half-angels of\r\nthree shillings and four pence. He made silver money of three pence, a\r\ngroat, and so of other coins after that rate, to the great harm of the\r\ncommons. W. Lord Hastings, the king’s chamberlain, being master of the\r\nking’s mints, undertook to make the monies under form following, to\r\nwit,--of gold, a piece of eight shillings and four pence sterling, which\r\nshould be called a noble of gold, of the which there should be fifty\r\nsuch pieces in the pound weight of the Tower; another piece of gold of\r\nfour shillings and two pence sterling, and to be of them an hundred such\r\npieces in the pound; and a third piece of gold, of two shillings and one\r\npenny sterling, two hundred such pieces in the pound; every pound weight\r\nof the Tower to be worth twenty pounds, sixteen shillings, and eight\r\npence, the which should be twenty-three carats, three grains and a half\r\nfine, etc., and for silver thirty-seven shillings and six pence; the\r\npiece of four pence to be one hundred and twelve groats and two pence in\r\nthe pound weight.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1504, King Henry VII. appointed a new coin, to wit, a groat,\r\nand half-groat, which bare but half faces; the same time also was coined\r\na groat, which was in value twelve pence, but of those but a few, after\r\nthe rate of forty pence the ounce.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1526, the 18th of Henry VIII., the angel noble being\r\nthen the sixth part of an ounce troy, so that six angels were just\r\nan ounce, which was forty shillings sterling, and the angel was also\r\nworth two ounces of silver, so that six angels were worth twelve ounces\r\nof silver, which was forty shillings. A proclamation was made on the\r\nsixth of September, that the angel should go for seven shillings and\r\nfour pence, the royal for eleven shillings, and the crown for four\r\nshillings and four-pence. And on the fifth of November following, again\r\nby proclamation, the angel was enhanced to seven shillings and sixpence,\r\nand so every ounce of gold to be forty-five shillings, and the ounce of\r\nsilver at three shillings and nine pence in value.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1544, the 35th of Henry VIII., on the 16th of May,\r\nproclamation was made for the enhancing of gold to forty-eight\r\nshillings, and silver to four shillings the ounce. Also the king caused\r\nto be coined base moneys, to wit, pieces of twelve pence, six pence,\r\nfour pence, two pence, and a penny, in weight as the late sterling, in\r\nshow good silver, but inwardly copper. These pieces had whole, or broad\r\nfaces, and continued current after that rate till the 5th of Edward\r\nVI., when they were on the 9th of July called down, the shilling to\r\nnine pence, the groat to three pence, etc., and on the 17th of August\r\nfrom nine pence to six pence, etc. And on the 30th of October was\r\npublished new coins of silver and gold to be made, a piece of silver\r\nfive shillings sterling, a piece of two shillings and five pence, of\r\ntwelve pence, of six pence, a penny with a double rose, half-penny a\r\nsingle rose, and a farthing with a portclose. Coins of fine gold: a\r\nwhole sovereign of thirty shillings, an angel of ten shillings, an\r\nangelet of five shillings. Of crown gold: a sovereign twenty shillings,\r\nhalf-sovereign ten shillings, five shillings, two shillings and six\r\npence, and base moneys to pass as before, which continued till the 2nd\r\nof Queen Elizabeth, then called to a lower rate, taken to the mint,\r\nand refined, the silver whereof being coined with a new stamp of her\r\nmajesty, the dross was carried to foul highways, to heighten them. This\r\nbase money, for the time, caused the old sterling moneys to be hoarded\r\nup, so that I have seen twenty-one shillings current given for one old\r\nangel to gild withal. Also rents of lands and tenements, with prices of\r\nvictuals, were raised far beyond the former rates, hardly since to be\r\nbrought down. Thus much for base moneys coined and current in England\r\nhave I known. But for leather moneys, as many people have fondly talked,\r\nI find no such matter. I read,[77] that King John of France, being taken\r\nprisoner by Edward the Black Prince at the battle of Poictiers, paid\r\na ransom of three millions of florences, whereby he brought the realm\r\ninto such poverty, that many years after they used leather money, with a\r\nlittle stud or nail of silver in the middle thereof. Thus much for mint\r\nand coinage, by occasion of this Tower (under correction of others more\r\nskilful) may suffice. And now to other accidents there.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1360, the peace between England and France being confirmed,\r\nKing Edward came over into England, and straight to the Tower, to see\r\nthe French king then prisoner there, whose ransom he assessed at three\r\nmillions of florences, and so delivered him from prison, and brought him\r\nwith honour to the sea.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1381, the rebels of Kent drew out of the Tower (where the\r\nking was then lodged) Simon Sudberie, archbishop of Canterbury, lord\r\nchancellor, Robert Hales, prior of St. John’s, and treasurer of England,\r\nWilliam Appleton, friar, the king’s confessor, and John Legg, a sergeant\r\nof the king’s, and beheaded them on the Tower hill, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1387, King Richard held his feast of Christmas in the Tower.\r\nAnd in the year 1399, the same king was sent prisoner to the Tower.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1414, Sir John Oldcastell brake out of the Tower. And the\r\nsame year, a parliament being holden at Leycester, a porter of the Tower\r\nwas drawn, hanged, and headed, whose head was sent up, and set over the\r\nTower gate, for consenting to one Whitlooke, that brake out of the Tower.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1419, Friar Randulph was sent to the Tower, and was there\r\nslain by the parson of St. Peter’s in the Tower.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1428, there came to London, a lewd fellow, feigning himself\r\nto be sent from the Emperor to the young King Henry VI., calling himself\r\nBaron of Blakamoore, and that he should be the principal physician\r\nin this kingdom; but his subtlety being known, he was apprehended,\r\ncondemned, drawn, hanged, headed, and quartered, his head set on the\r\nTower of London, and his quarters on four gates of the city.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1458, in Whitsun week, the Duke of Somerset, with Anthonie\r\nRivers, and other four, kept jousts before the queen in the Tower of\r\nLondon, against three esquires of the queen’s, and others.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1465, King Henry VI. was brought prisoner to the Tower,\r\nwhere he remained long.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1470, the Tower was yielded to Sir Richard Lee, mayor of\r\nLondon, and his brethren the aldermen, who forthwith entered the same,\r\ndelivered King Henry of his imprisonment, and lodged him in the king’s\r\nlodging there; but the next year he was again sent thither prisoner, and\r\nthere murdered.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1478, George Duke of Clarence was drowned with malmsey in\r\nthe Tower; and within five years after King Edward V., with his brother,\r\nwere said to be murdered there.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1485, John Earl of Oxford was made constable of the Tower,\r\nand had custody of the lions granted him.[78]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1501, in the month of May, was a royal tourney of lords and\r\nknights in the Tower of London before the king.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1502, Queen Elizabeth, wife to Henry VII., died of\r\nchildbirth in the Tower.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1512, the chapel in the high White Tower was burnt. In the\r\nyear 1536 Queen Anne Bullein was beheaded in the Tower. 1541, Lady\r\nKatherine Howard, wife to King Henry VIII., was also beheaded there.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1546, the 27th of April, being Tuesday in Easter week,\r\nWilliam Foxley, potmaker for the Mint in the Tower of London, fell\r\nasleep, and so continued sleeping, and could not be wakened with\r\npricking, cramping, or otherwise, burning whatsoever, until the first\r\nday of the term, which was full fourteen days and fifteen nights, or\r\nmore, for that Easter term beginneth not before seventeen days after\r\nEaster. The cause of his thus sleeping could not be known, though the\r\nsame was diligently searched after by the king’s physicians, and other\r\nlearned men; yea, the king himself examining the said William Foxley,\r\nwho was in all points found at his awakening to be as if he had slept\r\nbut one night. And he lived more than forty years after in the said\r\nTower, to wit, until the year of Christ 1587, and then deceased on\r\nWednesday in Easter week.\r\n\r\nThus much for these accidents: and now to conclude thereof in summary.\r\nThis Tower is a citadel to defend or command the city; a royal palace\r\nfor assemblies or treaties; a prison of state for the most dangerous\r\noffenders; the only place of coinage for all England at this time; the\r\narmoury for warlike provision; the treasury of the ornaments and jewels\r\nof the crown; and general conserver of the most records of the king’s\r\ncourts of justice at Westminster.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOWER ON LONDON BRIDGE\r\n\r\nThe next tower on the river of Thames is on London bridge, at the north\r\nend of the drawbridge. This tower was newly begun to be built in the\r\nyear 1426. John Reynwell, mayor of London, laid one of the first corner\r\nstones in the foundation of this work, the other three were laid by\r\nthe sheriffs and bridge masters; upon every of these four stones was\r\nengraven in fair roman letters the name of “Ihesus.” And these stones I\r\nhave seen laid in the bridge storehouse since they were taken up, when\r\nthat tower was of late newly made of timber. This gate and tower was at\r\nthe first strongly built up of stone, and so continued until the year\r\n1577, in the month of April, when the same stone arched gate and tower\r\nbeing decayed, was begun to be taken down, and then were the heads of\r\nthe traitors removed thence, and set on the tower over the gate at the\r\nbridge-foot towards Southwark. This said tower being taken down, a new\r\nfoundation was drawn, and Sir John Langley, lord mayor, laid the first\r\nstone in the presence of the sheriffs and bridge masters, on the 28th of\r\nAugust; and in the month of September, in the year 1579, the same tower\r\nwas finished--a beautiful and chargeable piece of work, all above the\r\nbridge being of timber.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOWER ON THE SOUTH OF LONDON BRIDGE\r\n\r\nAnother tower there is on London bridge, to wit, over the gate at the\r\nsouth end of the same bridge towards Southwark. This gate, with the\r\ntower thereupon, and two arches of the bridge, fell down, and no man\r\nperished by the fall thereof, in the year 1436;[79] towards the new\r\nbuilding whereof divers charitable citizens gave large sums of money;\r\nwhich gate, being then again newly built, was, with seventeen houses\r\nmore on the bridge, in the year 1471, burnt by the mariners and sailors\r\nof Kent, Bastard Fauconbridge being their captain.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAYNARD’S CASTLE\r\n\r\nIn the west of this city (saith Fitzstephen) are two most strong\r\ncastles, etc. Also Gervasius Tilbury,[80] in the reign of Henry II.,\r\nwriting of these castles, hath to this effect:--“Two castels,” saith\r\nhe, “are built with walles and rampires, whereof one is, in right of\r\npossession, Baynardes; the other the Barons of Mountfichet.” The first\r\nof these castles, banking on the river Thames, was called Baynard’s\r\nCastle, of Baynard a nobleman, that came in with the Conqueror, and\r\nthen built it, and deceased in the reign of William Rufus; after whose\r\ndecease Geffrey Baynard succeeded, and then William Baynard, in the\r\nyear 1111, who by forfeiture for felony, lost his barony of Little\r\nDunmow, and King Henry gave it wholly to Robert, the son of Richard,\r\nthe son of Gilbard of Clare, and to his heirs, together with the honour\r\nof Baynard’s Castle. This Robert married Maude de Sent Licio, lady\r\nof Bradham, and deceased 1134; was buried at St. Needes by Gilbert of\r\nClare, his father. Walter his son succeeded him; he took to wife Matilde\r\nde Bocham, and after her decease, Matilde, the daughter and co-heir\r\nof Richard de Lucy, on whom he begat Robert and other: he deceased in\r\nthe year 1198, and was buried at Dunmow; after whom succeeded Robert\r\nFitzwater, a valiant knight.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1213 there arose a great discord between King John\r\nand his barons, because Matilda, surnamed the Fair, daughter to the\r\nsaid Robert Fitzwater, whom the king unlawfully loved, but could not\r\nobtain her, nor her father would consent thereunto, whereupon, and for\r\nother like causes, ensued war through the whole realm. The barons were\r\nreceived into London, where they greatly endamaged the king; but in the\r\nend the king did not only therefore banish the said Fitzwater, amongst\r\nother, out of the realm, but also caused his castle called Baynard, and\r\nother his houses, to be spoiled; which thing being done, a messenger\r\nbeing sent unto Matilda the Fair about the king’s suit, whereunto she\r\nwould not consent, she was poisoned;[81] Robert Fitzwater, and other,\r\nbeing then passed into France, and some into Scotland, etc.[82]\r\n\r\nIt happened in the year 1214, King John being then in France with a\r\ngreat army, that a truce was taken betwixt the two kings of England\r\nand France for the term of five years; and a river, or arm of the sea,\r\nbeing then between either host, there was a knight in the English host,\r\nthat cried to them of the other side, willing some one of their knights\r\nto come and joust a course or twain with him; whereupon, without stay,\r\nRobert Fitzwater, being on the French part, made himself ready, ferried\r\nover, and got on horseback, without any man to help him, and showed\r\nhimself ready to the face of his challenger, whom at the first course\r\nhe struck so hard with his great spear, that horse and man fell to\r\nthe ground; and when his spear was broken he went back to the King of\r\nFrance; which when the king had seen, “By God’s tooth,” quoth he (after\r\nhis usual oath), “he were a king indeed that had such a knight.” The\r\nfriends of Robert, hearing these words, kneeled down, and said:--“O\r\nking, he is your knight; it is Robert Fitzwater.” And thereupon, the\r\nnext day he was sent for, and restored to the king’s favour; by which\r\nmeans peace was concluded, and he received his livings, and had license\r\nto repair his castle of Baynard, and other castles.\r\n\r\nThe year 1216, the 1st of Henry III., the castle of Hartford being\r\ndelivered to Lewis the French prince, and the barons of England, Robert\r\nFitzwater requiring to have the same, because the keeping thereof did\r\nby ancient right and title pertain to him, was answered by Lewis, “that\r\nEnglishmen were not worthy to have such holds in keeping, because they\r\ndid betray their own lord,” etc. This Robert deceased in the year 1234,\r\nand was buried at Dunmow, and Walter his son that succeeded him. 1258,\r\nhis barony of Baynard, was in the ward of King Henry, in the nonage\r\nof Robert Fitzwater. This Robert took to his second wife, Ælianor,\r\ndaughter and heir to the Earl of Ferrars, in the year 1289; and in\r\nthe year 1303, on the 12th of March, before John Blondon, mayor of\r\nLondon, he acknowledged his service to the same city, and sware upon\r\nthe Evangelists, that he would be true to the liberties thereof, and\r\nmaintain the same to his power, and the counsel of the same to keep, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RIGHTS THAT BELONGED TO ROBERT FITZWALTER CHASTALIAN OF LONDON, LORD\r\nOF WODEHAM, WERE THESE:--\r\n\r\nThe said Robert, and his heirs, ought to be, and are chief bannerers\r\nof London, in fee of the chastilarie, which he and his ancestors had\r\nby Castle Baynard, in the said city. In time of war the said Robert,\r\nand his heirs, ought to serve the city in manner as followeth: that is,\r\nThe said Robert ought to come, he being the twentieth man of arms on\r\nhorseback, covered with cloth, or armour, unto the great west door of\r\nSt. Paul, with his banner displayed before him of his arms; and when he\r\nis come to the said door, mounted and apparelled, as before is said, the\r\nmayor with his aldermen and sheriffs armed in their arms, shall come out\r\nof the said church of St. Paul, unto the said door, with a banner in his\r\nhand, all on foot, which banner shall be gules, with the image of St.\r\nPaul, gold, the face, hands, feet, and sword, of silver; and as soon as\r\nthe said Robert shall see the mayor, aldermen, and sheriffs, come on\r\nfoot out of the church, armed with such a banner, he shall alight from\r\nhis horse, and salute the mayor, and say to him,--“Sir mayor, I am come\r\nto do my service, which I owe to the city.” And the mayor and aldermen\r\nshall answer,--“We give to you, as our bannerer of fee in this city,\r\nthis banner of this city to bear, and govern to the honour and profit\r\nof the city to our power.” And the said Robert and his heirs shall\r\nreceive the banner in his hands, and shall go on foot out of the gate\r\nwith the banner in his hands; and the mayor, aldermen, and sheriffs,\r\nshall follow to the door, and shall bring a horse to the said Robert\r\nworth twenty pounds, which horse shall be saddled with a saddle of the\r\narms of the said Robert, and shall be covered with sandals of the said\r\narms. Also they shall present to him twenty pounds sterling money, and\r\ndeliver it to the chamberlain of the said Robert for his expenses that\r\nday. Then the said Robert shall mount upon the horse which the mayor\r\npresented to him, with the banner in his hand, and as soon as he is up,\r\nhe shall say to the mayor, that he cause a marshal to be chosen for the\r\nhost, one of the city; which marshal being chosen, the said Robert shall\r\ncommand the mayor and burgesses of the city to warn the commoners to\r\nassemble together, and they shall all go under the banner of St. Paul,\r\nand the said Robert shall bear it himself unto Aldgate, and there the\r\nsaid Robert and mayor shall deliver the said banner of St. Paul from\r\nthence, to whom they shall assent or think good. And if they must make\r\nany issue forth of the city, then the said Robert ought to choose two\r\nforth of every ward, the most sage personages, to foresee to the safe\r\nkeeping of the city after they be gone forth. And this counsel shall be\r\ntaken in the priory of the Trinity near unto Aldgate. And before every\r\ntown or castle which the host of London besiege, if the siege continue a\r\nwhole year, the said Robert shall have for every siege of the commonalty\r\nof London an hundred shillings for his travail, and no more. These\r\nbe the rights that the said Robert hath in the time of war.--Rights\r\nbelonging to Robert Fitzwalter, and to his heirs in the city of London,\r\nin the time of peace, are these: that is to say, the said Robert hath\r\na soken or ward in the city, that is, a wall of the canonry of St.\r\nPaul, as a man goeth down the street before the brewhouse of St. Paul\r\nunto the Thames, and so to the side of the mill, which is in the water\r\nthat cometh down from the Fleet bridge, and goeth so by London walls,\r\nbetwixt the Friers preachers and Ludgate, and so returneth back by the\r\nhouse of the said Friars unto the said wall of the said canonry of St.\r\nPaul, that is, all the parish of St. Andrew, which is in the gift of his\r\nancestors by the said seigniority. And so the said Robert hath appendant\r\nunto the said soken all these things under-written,--that he ought to\r\nhave a soke man, and to place what sokeman he will, so he be of the\r\nsokemanry, or the same ward; and if any of the sokemanry be impleaded in\r\nthe Guildhall, of any thing that toucheth not the body of the mayor that\r\nfor the time is, or that toucheth the body of no sheriff, it is not\r\nlawful for the sokeman of the sokemanry of the said Robert Fitzwalter\r\nto demand a court of the said Robert, and the mayor, and his citizens\r\nof London, ought to grant him to have a court, and in his court he\r\nought to bring his judgments, as it is assented and agreed upon in this\r\nGuildhall, that shall be given them. If any, therefore, be taken in his\r\nsokenly, he ought to have his stocks and imprisonment in his soken; and\r\nhe shall be brought from thence to the Guildhall before the mayor, and\r\nthere they shall provide him his judgment that ought to be given of him;\r\nbut his judgment shall not be published till he come into the court of\r\nthe said Robert, and in his liberty. And the judgment shall be such,\r\nthat if he have deserved death by treason, he to be tied to a post in\r\nthe Thames at a good wharf where boats are fastened, two ebbings and\r\ntwo flowings of the water. And if he be condemned for a common thief,\r\nhe ought to be led to the Elms, and there suffer his judgment as other\r\nthieves. And so the said Robert and his heirs hath honour that he\r\nholdeth a great franchise within the city, that the mayor of the city\r\nand citizens are bound to do him of right, that is to say, that when the\r\nmayor will hold a great council, he ought to call the said Robert, and\r\nhis heirs, to be with him in council of the city, and the said Robert\r\nought to be sworn to be of council with the city against all people,\r\nsaving the king and his heirs. And when the said Robert cometh to the\r\nhustings in the Guildhall of the city, the mayor, or his lieutenant,\r\nought to rise against him, and set him down near unto him; and so long\r\nas he is in the Guildhall, all the judgment ought to be given by his\r\nmouth, according to the record of the recorders of the said Guildhall;\r\nand so many waifes as come so long as he is there, he ought to give\r\nthem to the bailiffs of the town, or to whom he will, by the counsel of\r\nthe mayor of the city. These be the franchises that belonged to Robert\r\nFitzwalter in London, in time of peace; which for the antiquity thereof\r\nI have noted out of an old record.\r\n\r\nThis Robert deceased in the year 1305, leaving issue Walter Fitzrobert,\r\nwho had issue Robert Fitzwalter, unto whom, in the year 1320, the\r\ncitizens of London acknowledged the right which they ought to him and\r\nhis heirs for the Castle Baynard; he deceased 1325; unto whom succeeded\r\nRobert Fitzrobert, Fitzwalter, etc. More of the Lord Fitzwalter may\r\nye read in my Annals in 51st of Edward III. But how this honour of\r\nBaynard’s castle, with the appurtenances, fell from the possession of\r\nthe Fitzwalters, I have not read; only I find, that in the year 1428,\r\nthe 7th of Henry VI., a great fire was at Baynard’s castle, and that\r\nsame Humfrey, Duke of Gloucester, built it of new. By his death and\r\nattainder, in the year 1446, it came to the hands of Henry VI., and\r\nfrom him to Richard, Duke of York, of whom we read, that in the year\r\n1457 he lodged there, as in his own house. In the year 1460, the 28th\r\nof February, the Earls of March and of Warwick, with a great power of\r\nmen, but few of name, entered the city of London, where they were of the\r\ncitizens joyously received; and upon the 3rd of March, being Sunday,\r\nthe said earl caused to be mustered his people in St. John’s field;\r\nwhereunto that host was showed and proclaimed certain articles and\r\npoints wherein King Henry, as they said, had offended; and thereupon,\r\nit was demanded of the said people, whether the said Henry was worthy\r\nto reign as king any longer or not: whereunto the people cried Nay.\r\nThen it was asked of them, whether they would have the Earl of March\r\nfor their king; and they cried, Yea, Yea. Whereupon, certain captains\r\nwere appointed to bear report thereof unto the said Earl of March, then\r\nbeing lodged at his castle of Baynard. Whereof when the earl was by them\r\nadvertised, he thanked God, and them for their election; notwithstanding\r\nhe showed some countenance of insufficiency in him to occupy so great a\r\ncharge, till by exhortation of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop\r\nof Excester, and certain noblemen, he granted to their petition; and\r\non the next morrow at Paul’s he went on procession, offered, and had\r\n_Te Deum_ sung. Then was he with great royalty conveyed to Westminster,\r\nand there, in the great hall, set in the king’s seat, with St. Edward’s\r\nsceptre in his hand.\r\n\r\nEdward IV. being dead, leaving his eldest son Edward, and his second son\r\nRichard, both infants, Richard, Duke of Glocester,[83] being elected by\r\nthe nobles and commons in the Guildhall of London, took on him the title\r\nof the realm and kingdom, as imposed upon him in this Baynard’s castle,\r\nas ye may read penned by Sir Thomas More, and set down in my Annals.\r\n\r\nHenry VII., about the year 1501, the 16th of his reign, repaired, or\r\nrather new built this house, not embattled, or so strongly fortified\r\ncastle like, but far more beautiful and commodious for the entertainment\r\nof any prince or great estate. In the 17th of his reign, he, with his\r\nqueen were lodged there, and came from thence to Powles church, where\r\nthey made their offering, dined in the bishop’s palace, and so returned.\r\nThe 18th of his reign he was lodged there, and the ambassadors from the\r\nking of the Romans, where thither brought to his presence, and from\r\nthence the king came to Powles, and was there sworn to the king of the\r\nRomans, as the said king had sworn to him.\r\n\r\nThe 20th of the said king, he with his knights of the order, all in\r\ntheir habits of the Garter, rode from the Tower of London, through the\r\ncity, unto the cathedral church of St. Paul’s, and there heard evensong,\r\nand from thence they rode to Baynard’s castle, where the king lodged;\r\nand on the next morrow, in the same habit they rode from thence again\r\nto the said church of St. Paul’s, went on procession, heard the divine\r\nservice, offered, and returned. The same year the king of Castile was\r\nlodged there.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1553, the 19th of July, the council, partly moved with the\r\nright of the Lady Mary’s cause, partly considering that the most of\r\nthe realm were wholly bent on her side, changing their mind from Lady\r\nJane, lately proclaimed queen, assembled themselves at this Baynard’s\r\ncastle, where they communed with the Earl of Pembroke, and the Earl of\r\nShrewsbury, and Sir John Mason, clerk of the council, sent for the lord\r\nmayor, and then riding into Cheap to the cross, where Garter King at\r\nArms, trumpet being sounded, proclaimed the Lady Mary, daughter of King\r\nHenry VIII., and Queen Katherine, queen of England, etc.\r\n\r\nThis castle now belongeth to the Earl of Pembroke.[84]\r\n\r\nNext adjoining to this castle was sometime a tower, the name whereof I\r\nhave not read; but that the same was built by Edward II. is manifest by\r\nthis that followeth. King Edward III., in the second year of his reign,\r\ngave unto William de Ros, of Hamolake, in Yorkshire, a tower upon the\r\nwater of Thames, by the castle of Baynard in the city of London, which\r\ntower his father had built; he gave the said tower and appurtenances to\r\nthe said William Hamolake, and his heirs, for a rose yearly, to be paid\r\nfor all service due, etc. This tower, as seemeth to me, was since called\r\nLegat’s inn, the 7th of Edward IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOWER OF MOUNTFIQUIT\r\n\r\nThe next tower or castle, banking also on the river of Thames, was, as\r\nis afore showed, called Mountfiquit’s castle, of a nobleman, Baron of\r\nMountfiquit, the first builder thereof, who came in with William the\r\nConqueror, and was since named Le Sir Mountfiquit. This castle he built\r\nin a place not far distant from Baynard’s, towards the west. The same\r\nWilliam Mountfiquit lived in the reign of Henry I., and was witness to\r\na charter then granted to the city for the sheriffs of London. Richard\r\nMountfiquit lived in King John’s time; and in the year 1213, was by the\r\nsame king banished the realm into France, when peradventure King John\r\ncaused his castle of Mountfiquit, amongst other castles of the barons,\r\nto be overthrown; the which after his return, might be by him again\r\nre-edified; for the total destruction thereof was about the year 1276,\r\nwhen Robert Kilwarby, archbishop of Canterbury, began the foundation of\r\nthe Fryers Preachers church there, commonly called the Blacke Fryers, as\r\nappeareth by a charter the 4th of Edward I., wherein is declared that\r\nGregorie de Rocksley, mayor of London, and the barons of the same city,\r\ngranted and gave unto the said Archbishop Robert, two lanes or ways next\r\nthe street of Baynard’s castle, and the tower of Mountfiquit, to be\r\napplied for the enlargement of the said church and place.\r\n\r\nOne other tower there was also situate on the river of Thames near unto\r\nthe said Blacke Fryers church, on the west part thereof built at the\r\ncitizens’ charges, but by license and commandment of Edward I. and of\r\nEdward II., as appeareth by their grants; which tower was then finished,\r\nand so stood for the space of three hundred years, and was at the last\r\ntaken down by the commandment of John Shaw, mayor of London, in the year\r\n1502.\r\n\r\nAnother tower, or castle, also was there in the west part of the city\r\npertaining to the king. For I read, that in the year 1087, the 20th\r\nof William I., the city of London, with the church of St. Paul, being\r\nburned, Mauritius, then bishop of London, afterward began the foundation\r\nof a new church, whereunto King William, saith mine author, gave the\r\nchoice stones of this castle standing near to the bank of the river of\r\nThames, at the west end of the city. After this Mauritius, Richard his\r\nsuccessor purchased the streets about Paul’s church,[85] compassing the\r\nsame with a wall of stone and gates. King Henry I. gave to this Richard\r\nso much of the moat or wall of the castle, on the Thames side to the\r\nsouth, as should be needful to make the said wall of the churchyard, and\r\nso much more as should suffice to make a way without the wall on the\r\nnorth side, etc.\r\n\r\nThis tower or castle thus destroyed, stood, as it may seem, where now\r\nstandeth the house called Bridewell. For notwithstanding the destruction\r\nof the said castle or tower, the house remained large, so that the kings\r\nof this realm long after were lodged there, and kept their courts; for\r\nuntil the 9th year of Henry III. the courts of law and justice were\r\nkept in the king’s house, wheresoever he was lodged, and not elsewhere.\r\nAnd that the kings have been lodged, and kept their law courts in this\r\nplace, I could show you many authors of record, but for plain proof\r\nthis one may suffice. “_Hæc est finalis concordia, facta in Curia\r\nDomini regis apud Sanct. Bridgid. London. a die Sancti Michaelis in\r\n15 dies, Anno regni regis Johannis 7. coram G. Fil. Petri. Eustachio\r\nde Fauconberg, Johanne de Gestlinge, Osbart filio Hervey, Walter De\r\nCrisping Justiciar. et aliis baronibus Domini regis._”[86] More, as\r\nMatthew Paris hath, about the year 1210, King John, in the 12th of his\r\nreign, summoned a parliament at St. Bride’s in London, where he exacted\r\nof the clergy and religious persons the sum of one hundred thousand\r\npounds; and besides all this, the white monks were compelled to cancel\r\ntheir privileges, and to pay forty thousand pounds to the king, etc.\r\nThis house of St. Bride’s of latter time being left, and not used by the\r\nkings, fell to ruin, insomuch that the very platform thereof remained\r\nfor great part waste, and, as it were, but a laystall of filth and\r\nrubbish; only a fair well remained there. A great part of this house,\r\nnamely, on the west, as hath been said, was given to the Bishop of\r\nSalisbury; the other part towards the east remaining waste until King\r\nHenry VIII. built a stately and beautiful house thereupon, giving it to\r\nname Bridewell, of the parish and well there. This house he purposely\r\nbuilt for the entertainment of the Emperor Charles V., who in the year\r\n1522 came into this city, as I have showed in my Summary, Annals, and\r\nlarge Chronicles.\r\n\r\nOn the north-west side of the city, near unto Redcross street, there\r\nwas a tower, commonly called Barbican, or Burhkenning; for that the\r\nsame being placed on a high ground, and also built of some good height,\r\nwas in old time as a watch-tower for the city, from whence a man might\r\nbehold and view the whole city towards the south, and also into Kent,\r\nSussex, and Surrey, and likewise every other way, east, north, or west.\r\n\r\nSome other Burhkennings, or watch-towers, there were of old time in and\r\nabout the city, all which were repaired, yea, and others new built, by\r\nGilbart de Clare, Earl of Glocester, in the reign of King Henry III.,\r\nwhen the barons were in arms, and held the city against the king; but\r\nthe barons being reconciled to his favour in the year 1267, he caused\r\nall their burhkennings, watch-towers, and bulwarks, made and repaired\r\nby the said earl, to be plucked down, and the ditches to be filled\r\nup, so that nought of them might be seen to remain; and then was this\r\nburhkenning, amongst the rest, overthrown and destroyed; and although\r\nthe ditch near thereunto, called Hound’s ditch, was stopped up, yet the\r\nstreet of long time after was called Hound’s ditch; and of late time\r\nmore commonly called Barbican. The plot or seat of this burhkenning, or\r\nwatch-tower, King Edward III., in the year 1336, and the 10th of his\r\nreign, gave unto Robert Ufford, Earl of Suffolk, by the name of his\r\nmanor of Base court, in the parish of St. Giles without Cripplegate, of\r\nLondon, commonly called the Barbican.\r\n\r\nTower Royal was of old time the king’s house. King Stephen was there\r\nlodged; but sithence called the Queen’s Wardrobe. The princess, mother\r\nto King Richard II. in the 4th of his reign was lodged there; being\r\nforced to fly from the Tower of London when the rebels possessed it. But\r\non the 15th of June (saith Froissart), Wat Tyler being slain, the king\r\nwent to this lady princess his mother, then lodged in the Tower Royal,\r\ncalled the Queen’s Wardrobe, where she had tarried two days and two\r\nnights; which tower (saith the record of Edward III., the 36th year[87])\r\nwas in the parish of St. Michel de Paternoster, etc. In the year 1386,\r\nKing Richard, with Queen Anne his wife, kept their Christmas at Eltham,\r\nwhither came to him Lion, king of Ermony,[88] under pretence to reform\r\npeace betwixt the kings of England and France; but what his coming\r\nprofited he only understood; for besides innumerable gifts that he\r\nreceived of the king and his nobles, the king lying then in this Tower\r\nRoyal, at the Queen’s Wardrobe in London, granted to him a charter of a\r\nthousand pounds by year during his life. He was, as he affirmed, chased\r\nout of his kingdom by the Tartarians. More concerning this tower shall\r\nyou read when you come to Vintry Ward, in which it standeth.\r\n\r\nSernes tower in Bucklesberie, was sometime the king’s house. Edward\r\nIII., in the 18th of his reign, appointed his exchange of moneys therein\r\nto be kept; and in the 32d, he gave the same tower to his free chapel of\r\nSt. Stephen at Westminster.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[64] W.

And there were other inferior\r\nschools also. Upon festival days the masters made solemn meetings in the\r\nchurches, where their scholars disputed logically and demonstratively;\r\nsome bringing enthimems, other perfect syllogisms; some disputed for\r\nshew, other to trace out the truth; cunning sophisters were thought\r\nbrave scholars when they flowed with words; others used fallacies;\r\nrhetoricians spake aptly to persuade, observing the precepts of art,\r\nand omitting nothing that might serve their purpose: the boys of\r\ndiverse schools did cap or pot verses, and contended of the principles\r\nof grammar; there were some which on the other side with epigrams and\r\nrymes, nipping and quipping their fellowes, and the faults of others,\r\nthough suppressing their names, moved thereby much laughter among their\r\nauditors.” Hitherto Fitzstephen, for schools and scholars, and for their\r\nexercises in the city in his days; sithence the which time, as to me it\r\nseemeth, by the increase of colleges and students in the universities\r\nof Oxford and Cambridge, the frequenting of schools, and exercises of\r\nscholars in the city, as had been accustomed, hath much decreased.\r\n\r\nThe three principal churches which had these famous schools by\r\nprivileges, must needs be the cathedral church of St. Paul for one;\r\nseeing that by a general council, holden in the year of Christ 1176,\r\nat Rome, in the patriarchy of Laterane, it was decreed, that every\r\ncathedral church should have his schoolmaster to teach poor scholars,\r\nand others as had been accustomed, and that no man should take any\r\nreward for license to teach. The second, as most ancient, may seem\r\nto have been the monastery of St. Peter’s at Westminster, whereof\r\nIngulphus, Abbot of Crowland, in the reign of William the Conqueror,\r\nwriteth thus:--“I, Ingulphus, an humble servant of God, born of\r\nEnglish parents, in the most beautiful city of London, for to attain\r\nto learning, was first put to Westminster, and after to study of\r\nOxford,” etc. And writing in praise of Queen Edgitha, wife to Edward\r\nthe Confessor: “I have seen her,” saith he, “often when being a boy, I\r\ncame to see my father dwelling in the king’s court, and often coming\r\nfrom school, when I met her, she would oppose me, touching my learning\r\nand lesson; and falling from grammar to logic, wherein she had some\r\nknowledge, she would subtilly conclude an argument with me, and by her\r\nhandmaiden give me three or four pieces of money, and send me unto the\r\npalace where I should receive some victuals, and then be dismissed.”\r\n\r\nThe third school seemeth to have been in the monastery of St. Saviour,\r\nat Bermondsey in Southwark; for other priories, as of St. John by\r\nSmithfield, St. Bartholomew in Smithfield, St. Mary Overie in Southwark,\r\nand that of the Holy Trinity by Aldgate, were all of later foundation,\r\nand the friaries, colleges, and hospitals, in this city, were raised\r\nsince them in the reigns of Henry III., Edward I., II., and III., etc.\r\nAll which houses had their schools, though not so famous as these first\r\nnamed.\r\n\r\nBut touching schools more lately advanced in this city, I read, that\r\nKing Henry V., having suppressed the priories aliens, whereof some were\r\nabout London; namely, one hospital, called Our Lady of Rouncivall,\r\nby Charing Cross; one other hospital in Oldborne; one other without\r\nCripplegate; and the fourth without Aldersgate; besides other that are\r\nnow worn out of memory, and whereof there is no monument remaining more\r\nthan Rouncivall, converted to a brotherhood, which continued till the\r\nreign of Henry VIII. or Edward VI. This, I say, and other their schools\r\nbeing broken up and ceased, King Henry VI., in the 24th of his reign,\r\nby patent, appointed, that there should be in London grammar schools,\r\nbesides St. Paul’s, at St. Martin’s le Grand, St. Mary le Bow in Cheap,\r\nSt. Dunstan’s in the west, and St. Anthony’s. And in the next year, to\r\nwit, 1447, the said king ordained by parliament that four other grammar\r\nschools should be erected, to wit, in the parishes of St. Andrew in\r\nOldborne, Allhallowes the Great in Thames street, St. Peter’s upon\r\nCornhill, and in the hospital of St. Thomas of Acons in West Cheap;\r\nsince the which time as divers schools, by suppressing of religious\r\nhouses, whereof they were members, in the reign of Henry VIII., have\r\nbeen decayed, so again have some others been newly erected, and founded\r\nfor them; as namely Paul’s school, in place of an old ruined house, was\r\nbuilt in most ample manner, and largely endowed, in the year 1512, by\r\nJohn Collet, Doctor of Divinity, Dean of Paul’s, for one hundred and\r\nfifty-three poor men’s children, for which there was ordained a master,\r\nsurmaster, or usher, and a chaplain. Again, in the year 1553, after\r\nthe erection of Christ’s hospital, in the late dissolved house of the\r\nGray Friars, a great number of poor children being taken in, a school\r\nwas also ordained there at the citizen’s charges. Also, in the year\r\n1561, the Merchant Taylors of London founded one notable free grammar\r\nschool, in the parish of St. Laurence Poultney by Candleweeke street,\r\nRichard Hils, late master of that company, having given five hundred\r\npounds towards the purchase of a house, called the Mannor of the Rose,\r\nsometime the Duke of Buckingham’s, wherein the school is kept. As for\r\nthe meeting of the schoolmasters on festival days, at festival churches,\r\nand the disputing of their scholars logically, etc., whereof I have\r\nbefore spoken, the same was long since discontinued; but the arguing of\r\nthe schoolboys about the principles of grammar hath been continued even\r\ntill our time; for I myself, in my youth, have yearly seen, on the eve\r\nof St. Bartholomew the Apostle, the scholars of divers grammar schools\r\nrepair unto the churchyard of St. Bartholomew, the priory in Smithfield,\r\nwhere upon a bank boarded about under a tree, some one scholar hath\r\nstepped up, and there hath opposed and answered, till he were by some\r\nbetter scholar overcome and put down; and then the overcomer taking\r\nthe place, did like as the first; and in the end the best opposers\r\nand answerers had rewards, which I observed not but it made both good\r\nschoolmasters, and also good scholars, diligently against such times to\r\nprepare themselves for the obtaining of this garland. I remember there\r\nrepaired to these exercises, amongst others, the masters and scholars of\r\nthe free schools of St. Paul’s in London, of St. Peter’s at Westminster,\r\nof St. Thomas Acon’s hospital, and of St. Anthonie’s hospital; whereof\r\nthe last-named commonly presented the best scholars, and had the prize\r\nin those days.\r\n\r\nThis priory of St. Bartholomew being surrendered to Henry VIII., those\r\ndisputations of scholars in that place surceased; and was again, only\r\nfor a year or twain, in the reign of Edward VI., revived in the cloister\r\nof Christ’s hospital, where the best scholars, then still of St.\r\nAnthonie’s school,[89] were rewarded with bows and arrows of silver,\r\ngiven to them by Sir Martin Bowes, goldsmith. Nevertheless, however the\r\nencouragement failed, the scholars of Paul’s, meeting with them of St.\r\nAnthonie’s, would call them Anthonie pigs, and they again would call the\r\nother pigeons of Paul’s, because many pigeons were bred in St. Paul’s\r\nchurch, and St. Anthonie was always figured with a pig following him;\r\nand mindful of the former usage, did for a long season disorderly in\r\nthe open street provoke one another with, _Salve tu quoque, placet tibi\r\nmecum disputare? Placet._ And so proceeding from this to questions in\r\ngrammar, they usually fell from words to blows with their satchels full\r\nof books, many times in great heaps, that they troubled the streets and\r\npassengers; so that finally they were restrained with the decay of St.\r\nAnthonie’s school. Out of this school have sprung divers famous persons,\r\nwhereof although time hath buried the names of many, yet in mine own\r\nremembrance may be numbered these following:--Sir Thomas More, knight,\r\nlord chancellor of England, Dr. Nicholas Heath, sometime Bishop of\r\nRochester, after of Worcester, and lastly Archbishop of York and Lord\r\nChancellor of England; Doctor John Whitgift, Bishop of Worcester, and\r\nafter Archbishop of Canterbury, etc.\r\n\r\nOf later time, in the year of Christ 1582, there was founded a public\r\nlecture in chirurgerie, to be read in the College of Physicians in\r\nKnight riders street, to begin in the year 1584, on the sixth of May,\r\nand so to be continued for ever, twice every week, on Wednesday and\r\nFriday, by the honourable Baron, John Lord Lombley, and the learned\r\nRichard Caldwell, doctor in physic, the reader whereof to be Richard\r\nForster, doctor of physic, during his life.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, about the same time there was also begun a mathematical\r\nlecture, to be read in a fair old chapel, built by Simon Eayre, within\r\nthe Leaden hall; whereof a learned citizen born, named Thomas Hood, was\r\nthe first reader. But this chapel, and other parts of that hall, being\r\nemployed for stowage of goods taken out of a great Spanish caracke, the\r\nsaid lecture ceased any more to be read, and was then in the year 1588\r\nread in the house of master Thomas Smith in Grasse street, etc.\r\n\r\nLast of all, Sir Thomas Gresham, knight, agent to the queen’s highness,\r\nby his last will and testament made in the year 1579, gave the Royal\r\nExchange, and all the buildings thereunto appertaining; that is to\r\nsay, the one moiety to the mayor and commonalty of London and their\r\nsuccessors, upon trust that they perform as shall be declared; and the\r\nother moiety to the mercers in like confidence. The mayor and commonalty\r\nare to find four to read lectures of divinity, astronomy, music, and\r\ngeometry, within his dwelling-house in Bishopsgate street, and to bestow\r\nthe sum of two hundred pounds; to wit, fifty pounds the piece, etc.\r\nThe mercers likewise are to find three readers, that is, in civil law,\r\nphysic, and rhetoric, within the same dwelling-house, the sum of one\r\nhundred and fifty pounds; to every reader, fifty pounds, etc.: which\r\ngift hath been since that time confirmed by parliament, to take effect\r\nand begin after the decease of the Lady Anne Gresham, which happened\r\nin the year 1596, and so to continue for ever. Whereupon the lecturers\r\nwere accordingly chosen and appointed to have begun their readings\r\nin the month of June, 1597; whose names were, Anthony Wootton, for\r\ndivinity; Doctor Mathew Guin, for physic; Doctor Henry Mountlow, for\r\nthe civil law; Doctor John Bull, for music; Beerewood, for astronomy;\r\nHenry Brigges, for geometry; and Caleb Willis, for rhetoric. These\r\nlectures are read daily, Sundays excepted, in the term times, by every\r\none upon his day, in the morning betwixt nine and ten, in Latin; in\r\nthe afternoon, betwixt two and three, in English; save that Dr. Bull\r\nis dispensed with to read the music lecture in English only upon two\r\nseveral days, Thursday and Saturday, in the afternoons, betwixt three\r\nand four of the clock.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[89] “Howsoever the same be now fallen, both in number and\r\nestimation.”--_1st edition_, p. 56.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSES OF STUDENTS IN THE COMMON LAW\r\n\r\n\r\nBut besides all this, there is in and about this city a whole\r\nuniversity, as it were, of students, practicers or pleaders, and judges\r\nof the laws of this realm, not living of common stipends, as in other\r\nuniversities it is for the most part done, but of their own private\r\nmaintenance, as being altogether fed either by their places or practice,\r\nor otherwise by their proper revenue, or exhibition of parents and\r\nfriends; for that the younger sort are either gentlemen or the sons of\r\ngentlemen, or of other most wealthy persons. Of these houses there be at\r\nthis day fourteen in all; whereof nine do stand within the liberties of\r\nthis city, and five in the suburbs thereof; to wit:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Within the liberties_\r\n\r\nSerjeants’ inn in Fleet Street, Serjeants’ inn in Chancery lane; for\r\njudges and sergeants only.\r\n\r\nThe Inner temple, the Middle temple, in Fleet street; houses of court.\r\n\r\nClifford’s inn in Fleet street, Thavies inn in Oldborne, Furnival’s inn\r\nin Oldborne, Barnard’s inn in Oldborne, Staple inn in Oldborne; houses\r\nof Chancery.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Without the liberties_\r\n\r\nGray’s inn in Oldborne, Lincoln’s inn in Chancery lane by the old\r\nTemple;[90] houses of court.\r\n\r\nClement’s inn, New inn, Lion’s inn; houses of Chancery, without Temple\r\nbar, in the liberty of Westminster.\r\n\r\nThere was sometime an inn of sergeants in Oldborne, as you may read of\r\nScrop’s inn over against St. Andrew’s church.\r\n\r\nThere was also one other inn of Chancery, called Chester’s inn, for the\r\nnearness of the Bishop of Chester’s house, but more commonly termed\r\nStrand inn, for that it stood in Strand street, and near unto Strand\r\nbridge without Temple bar, in the liberty of the duchy of Lancaster.\r\nThis inn of Chancery, with other houses near adjoining, were pulled\r\ndown in the reign of Edward VI. by Edward Duke of Sommerset, who in\r\nplace thereof raised that large and beautiful house, but yet unfinished,\r\ncalled Sommerset house.\r\n\r\nThere was moreover, in the reign of King Henry I., a tenth house of\r\nChancery, mentioned by Justice Fortescue in his book of the laws of\r\nEngland, but where it stood, or when it was abandoned, I cannot find,\r\nand therefore I will leave it, and return to the rest.\r\n\r\nThe houses of court be replenished partly with young students, and\r\npartly with graduates and practisers of the law; but the inns of\r\nChancery, being, as it were, provinces, severally subjected to the inns\r\nof court, be chiefly furnished with officers, attorneys, solicitors, and\r\nclerks, that follow the courts of the King’s Bench or Common Pleas; and\r\nyet there want not some other being young students, that come thither\r\nsometimes from one of the Universities, and sometimes immediately from\r\ngrammar schools; and these having spent some time in studying upon\r\nthe first elements and grounds of the law, and having performed the\r\nexercise of their own houses (called Boltas Mootes,[91] and putting of\r\ncases), they proceed to be admitted, and become students in some of\r\nthese four houses or inns of court, where continuing by the space of\r\nseven years or thereabouts, they frequent readings, meetings, boltings,\r\nand other learned exercises, whereby growing ripe in the knowledge of\r\nthe laws, and approved withal to be of honest conversation, they are\r\neither, by the general consent of the benchers or readers, being of\r\nthe most ancient, grave, and judicial men of every inn of the court,\r\nor by the special privilege of the present reader there, selected and\r\ncalled to the degree of utter barristers, and so enabled to be common\r\ncounsellors, and to practice the law, both in their chambers and at the\r\nbars.\r\n\r\nOf these, after that they be called to a further step of preferment,\r\ncalled the Bench, there are twain every year chosen among the benchers\r\nof every inn of court to be readers there, who do make their readings at\r\ntwo times in the year also; that is, one in Lent, and the other at the\r\nbeginning of August.\r\n\r\nAnd for the help of young students in every of the inns of Chancery,\r\nthey do likewise choose out of every one inn of court a reader, being\r\nno bencher, but an utter barrister there, of ten or twelve years’\r\ncontinuance, and of good profit in study. Now, from these of the said\r\ndegree of counsellors, or utter barristers, having continued therein the\r\nspace of fourteen or fifteen years at the least, the chiefest and best\r\nlearned are by the benchers elected to increase the number, as I said,\r\nof the bench amongst them; and so in their time do become first single,\r\nand then double, readers to the students of those houses of court;\r\nafter which last reading they be named apprentices at the law, and, in\r\ndefault of a sufficient number of sergeants at law, these are, at the\r\npleasure of the prince, to be advanced to the places of sergeants; out\r\nof which number of sergeants also the void places of judges are likewise\r\nordinarily filled; albeit, now and then some be advanced, by the special\r\nfavour of the prince, to the estate, dignity, and place, both of\r\nsergeant and judge, as it were in one instant. But from thenceforth they\r\nhold not any room in those inns of court, being translated to one of the\r\nsaid two inns, called Sergeante’s inns, where none but the sergeants and\r\njudges do converse.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[90] “In Oldborne.”--_1st edition._\r\n\r\n[91] Cowell, in his _Law Dictionary_, says, “Bolting is a term of art\r\nused in Gray’s Inn, and applied to the bolting or arguing of _moot_\r\ncases.” He endeavours to show that the bolting of cases is analogous\r\nto the _boulting_ or sifting of meal through a bag. All readers of\r\nShakspeare must be familiar with the use of the word in the latter sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF ORDERS AND CUSTOMS\r\n\r\n\r\nOf orders and customs in this city of old time, Fitzstephen saith as\r\nfolloweth: “Men of all trades, sellers of all sorts of wares, labourers\r\nin every work, every morning are in their distinct and several places:\r\nfurthermore, in London, upon the river side, between the wine in ships\r\nand the wine to be sold in taverns, is a common cookery, or cooks’ row;\r\nthere daily, for the season of the year, men might have meat, roast,\r\nsod, or fried; fish, flesh, fowls, fit for rich and poor. If any come\r\nsuddenly to any citizen from afar, weary, and not willing to tarry till\r\nthe meat be bought and dressed, while the servant bringeth water for his\r\nmaster’s hands, and fetcheth bread, he shall have immediately from the\r\nriver’s side all viands whatsoever he desireth: what multitude soever,\r\neither of soldiers or strangers, do come to the city, whatsoever hour,\r\nday or night, according to their pleasures may refresh themselves; and\r\nthey which delight in delicateness may be satisfied with as delicate\r\ndishes there as may be found elsewhere. And this Cooke’s row is very\r\nnecessary to the city; and, according to Plato in Gorgius, next to\r\nphysic, is the office of cooks, as part of a city.\r\n\r\n“Without one of the gates is a plain field, both in name and deed,\r\nwhere every Friday, unless it be a solemn bidden holy day, is a notable\r\nshow of horses to be sold; earls, barons, knights, and citizens repair\r\nthither to see or to buy; there may you of pleasure see amblers pacing\r\nit delicately; there may you see trotters fit for men of arms, sitting\r\nmore hardly; there may you have notable young horses, not yet broken;\r\nthere may you have strong steeds, well limbed geldings, whom the buyers\r\ndo specially regard for pace and swiftness; the boys which ride these\r\nhorses, sometimes two, sometimes three, do run races for wagers, with\r\na desire of praise, or hope of victory. In another part of that field\r\nare to be sold all implements of husbandry, as also fat swine, milch\r\nkine, sheep, and oxen; there stand also mares and horses fit for ploughs\r\nand teams, with their young colts by them. At this city, merchant\r\nstrangers of all nations had their keys and wharfs; the Arabians sent\r\ngold; the Sabians spice and frankincense; the Scythian armour, Babylon\r\noil, Indian purple garments, Egypt precious stones, Norway and Russia\r\nambergreece and sables, and the Frenchmen wine. According to the truth\r\nof Chronicles, this city is ancienter than Rome, built of the ancient\r\nTroyans and of Brute, before that was built by Romulus and Rhemus; and\r\ntherefore useth the ancient customs of Rome. This city, even as Rome,\r\nis divided into wards; it hath yearly sheriffs instead of consuls; it\r\nhath the dignity of senators in aldermen. It hath under officers, common\r\nsewers, and conduits in streets; according to the quality of causes,\r\nit hath general courts and assembles upon appointed days. I do not\r\nthink that there is any city wherein are better customs, in frequenting\r\nthe churches, in serving God, in keeping holy days, in giving alms,\r\nin entertaining strangers, in solemnising marriages, in furnishing\r\nbanquets, celebrating funerals, and burying dead bodies.\r\n\r\n“The only plagues of London are immoderate quaffing among the foolish\r\nsort, and often casualties by fire. Most part of the bishops, abbots,\r\nand great lords of the land have houses there, whereunto they resort,\r\nand bestow much when they are called to parliament by the king, or to\r\ncouncil by their metropolitan, or otherwise by their private business.”\r\n\r\nThus far Fitzstephen, of the estate of things in his time, whereunto may\r\nbe added the present, by conference whereof the alteration will easily\r\nappear.\r\n\r\nMen of trades and sellers of wares in this city have oftentimes since\r\nchanged their places, as they have found their best advantage. For\r\nwhereas mercers and haberdashers used to keep their shops in West\r\nCheape,[92] of later time they held them on London Bridge, where partly\r\nthey yet remain. The goldsmiths of Gutheron’s lane and Old Exchange\r\nare now for the most part removed into the south side of West Cheape,\r\nthe peperers and grocers of Soper’s lane are now in Bucklesberrie, and\r\nother places dispersed. The drapers of Lombard street and of Cornehill\r\nare seated in Candlewick street and Watheling street; the skinners from\r\nSt. Marie Pellipers, or at the Axe, into Budge row and Walbrooke; the\r\nstock fishmongers in Thames street; wet fishmongers in Knightriders\r\nstreet and Bridge street; the ironmongers, of Ironmongers’ lane and Old\r\nJurie, into Thames street; the vintners from the Vinetree into divers\r\nplaces. But the brewers for the more part remain near to the friendly\r\nwater of Thames; the butchers in Eastcheape, St. Nicholas shambles,\r\nand the Stockes market; the hosiers of old time in Hosier lane, near\r\nunto Smithfield, are since removed into Cordwayner street, the upper\r\npart thereof by Bow church, and last of all into Birchoveris lane by\r\nCornehill; the shoe-makers and curriers of Cordwayner street removed\r\nthe one to St. Martin’s le Grand, the other to London wall near unto\r\nMooregate; the founders remain by themselves in Lothberie; cooks,[93]\r\nor pastelars, for the more part in Thames street, the other dispersed\r\ninto divers parts; poulters of late removed out of the Poultrie, betwixt\r\nthe Stockes and the great Conduit in Cheape, into Grasse street and St.\r\nNicholas shambles; bowyers, from Bowyers’ row by Ludgate into divers\r\nplaces, and almost worn out with the fletchers; pater noster makers of\r\nold time, or bead-makers, and text-writers, are gone out of Pater noster\r\nrow, and are called stationers of Paule’s churchyard;[94] patten-makers,\r\nof St. Margaret, Pattens’ lane, clean worn out; labourers every work-day\r\nare to be found in Cheape, about Soper’s land end; horse-coursers and\r\nsellers of oxen, sheep, swine, and such like, remain in their old market\r\nof Smithfield, etc.\r\n\r\nThat merchants of all nations had their keys and wharfs at this city,\r\nwhereunto they brought their merchandises before and in the reign of\r\nHenry II., mine author wrote of his own knowledge to be true, though for\r\nthe antiquity of the city he took the common opinion. Also that this\r\ncity was in his time and afore divided into wards, had yearly sheriffs,\r\naldermen, general courts, and assemblies, and such like notes by him set\r\ndown, in commendation of the citizens; whereof there is no question,\r\nhe wrote likewise of his own experience, as being born and brought up\r\namongst them.\r\n\r\nAnd to confirm his opinion, concerning merchandises then hither\r\ntransported, whereof happily may be some argument, Thomas Clifford[95]\r\n(before Fitzstephen’s time), writing of Edward the Confessor, saith\r\nto this effect: “King Edward, intending to make his sepulchre at\r\nWestminster; for that it was near to the famous city of London, and\r\nthe river of Thames, that brought in all kind of merchandises from all\r\nparts of the world, etc.” And William of Malmesbury, that lived in\r\nthe reign of William I. and II., Henry I., and King Stephen, calleth\r\nthis a noble city, full of wealthy citizens, frequented with the trade\r\nof merchandises from all parts of the world. Also I read, in divers\r\nrecords, that of old time no woad was stowed or harboured in this city,\r\nbut all was presently sold in the ships, except by license purchased\r\nof the sheriffs, till of more later time; to wit, in the year 1236,\r\nAndrew Bokerell, being mayor, by assent of the principal citizens, the\r\nmerchants of Amiens, Nele, and Corby, purchased letters insealed with\r\nthe common seal of the city, that they when they come might harbour\r\ntheir woads, and therefore should give the mayor every year fifty\r\nmarks sterling; and the same year they gave one hundred pounds towards\r\nthe conveying of water from Tyborn to this city. Also the merchants\r\nof Normandie made fine for license to harbour their woads till it was\r\notherwise provided, in the year 1263, Thomas Fitz Thomas being mayor,\r\netc., which proveth that then as afore, they were here amongst other\r\nnations privileged.\r\n\r\nIt followeth in Fitzstephen, that the plagues of London in that time\r\nwere immoderate quaffing among fools, and often casualties by fire. For\r\nthe first--to wit, of quaffing--it continueth as afore, or rather is\r\nmightily increased, though greatly qualified among the poorer sort, not\r\nof any holy abstinence, but of mere necessity, ale and beer being small,\r\nand wines in price above their reach. As for prevention of casualties\r\nby fire, the houses in this city being then built all of timber, and\r\ncovered with thatch of straw or reed, it was long since thought good\r\npolicy in our forefathers wisely to provide, namely, in the year of\r\nChrist 1189, the first of Richard I., Henry Fitzalwine[96] being then\r\nmayor, that all men in this city should build their houses of stone up\r\nto a certain height, and to cover them with slate or baked tile; since\r\nwhich time, thanks be given to God, there hath not happened the like\r\noften consuming fires in this city as afore.\r\n\r\nBut now in our time, instead of these enormities, others are come\r\nin place no less meet to be reformed; namely, purprestures, or\r\nencroachments on the highways, lanes, and common grounds, in and\r\nabout this city; whereof a learned gentleman and grave citizen[97]\r\nhath not many years since written and exhibited a book to the mayor\r\nand commonalty; which book, whether the same have been by them read\r\nand diligently considered upon, I know not, but sure I am nothing is\r\nreformed since concerning this matter.\r\n\r\nThen the number of cars, drays, carts, and coaches, more than hath\r\nbeen accustomed, the streets and lanes being straitened, must needs be\r\ndangerous, as daily experience proveth.\r\n\r\nThe coachman rides behind the horse tails, lasheth them, and looketh not\r\nbehind him; the drayman sitteth and sleepeth on his dray, and letteth\r\nhis horse lead him home. I know that, by the good laws and customs of\r\nthis city,[98] shodde carts[99] are forbidden to enter the same, except\r\nupon reasonable cause, as service of the prince, or such like, they be\r\ntolerated. Also that the fore horse of every carriage should be lead by\r\nhand; but these good orders are not observed. Of old time coaches were\r\nnot known in this island, but chariots or whirlicotes, then so called,\r\nand they only used of princes or great estates, such as had their\r\nfootmen about them; and for example to note, I read that Richard II.,\r\nbeing threatened by the rebels of Kent, rode from the Tower of London to\r\nthe Myles end, and with him his mother, because she was sick and weak,\r\nin a whirlicote, the Earls of Buckingham, Kent, Warwicke, and Oxford,\r\nSir Thomas Percie, Sir Robert Knowles, the Mayor of London, Sir Aubery\r\nde Vere, that bare the king’s sword, with other knights and esquires\r\nattending on horseback. But in the next year, the said King Richard took\r\nto wife Anne, daughter to the King of Bohemia, that first brought hither\r\nthe riding upon side-saddles; and so was the riding in wherlicoates and\r\nchariots forsaken, except at coronations and such like spectacles; but\r\nnow of late years the use of coaches, brought out of Germany, is taken\r\nup, and made so common, as there is neither distinction of time nor\r\ndifference of persons observed; for the world runs on wheels with many\r\nwhose parents were glad to go on foot.\r\n\r\nLast of all, mine author in this chapter hath these words:[100] “Most\r\npart of the bishops, abbots, and great lords of the land, as if they\r\nwere citizens and freemen of London, had many fair houses to resort\r\nunto, and many rich and wealthy gentlemen spent their money there.” And\r\nin another place he hath these words: “Every Sunday in Lent a fresh\r\ncompany of young men comes into the fields on horseback, and the best\r\nhorsemen conducteth the rest; then march forth the citizens’ sons,\r\nand other young men, with disarmed lances and shields, and practise\r\nfeats of war; many courtiers likewise and attendants of noblemen repair\r\nto this exercise, and whilst the hope of victory doth inflame their\r\nminds, they do show good proof how serviceable they would be in martial\r\naffairs, etc.” Again he saith: “This city, in the troublesome time\r\nof King Stephen, showed at a muster twenty thousand armed horsemen\r\nand forty thousand footmen, serviceable for the wars, etc.” All which\r\nsayings of the said author, well considered, do plainly prove that in\r\nthose days the inhabitants and repairers to this city, of what estate\r\nsoever, spiritual or temporal, having houses here, lived together in\r\ngood amity with the citizens, every man observing the customs and orders\r\nof the city, and those to be contributary to charges here, rather than\r\nin any part of the land wheresoever. This city, being the heart of the\r\nrealm, the king’s chamber and prince’s seat, whereunto they made repair,\r\nand showed their forces, both of horses and of men, which caused in\r\ntroublesome time, as of King Stephen, the musters of this city to be so\r\ngreat in number.\r\n\r\nAnd here, to touch somewhat of greater families and households kept in\r\nformer times by noblemen, and great estates of this realm, according\r\nto their honours or dignities,[101] I have seen an account made by H.\r\nLeicester, cofferer to Thomas Earl of Lancaster, for one whole year’s\r\nexpenses in the Earl’s house, from the day next after Michaelmas, in\r\nthe seventh year of Edward II., until Michaelmass in the eight year\r\nof the same king, amounting to the sum of £7957 13_s._ 4-1/2_d._ as\r\nfolloweth:[102]\r\n\r\nTo wit, in the pantry, buttery, and kitchen, £3405, etc.: for one\r\nhundred and eighty-four tons, one pipe of red or claret wine, and one\r\nton of white wine bought for the house, £104 17_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\nFor grocery ware, £180 17_s._\r\n\r\nFor six barrels of sturgeon, £19.\r\n\r\nFor six thousand eight hundred stock-fishes, so called for dried fishes\r\nof all sorts, as lings, habardines, and other, £41 6_s._ 7_d._\r\n\r\nFor one thousand seven hundred and fourteen pounds of waxe, with\r\nvermelion and turpentine to make red waxe, £314 7_s._ 4-1/4_d._\r\n\r\nFor two thousand three hundred and nineteen pounds of tallow candles for\r\nthe household, and one thousand eight hundred and seventy of lights for\r\nParis candles, called perchers, £31 14_s._ 3_d._\r\n\r\nExpenses on the earl’s great horses, and the keeper’s wages, £486 4_s._\r\n3-1/4_d._\r\n\r\nLinen cloth for the earl and his chaplains, and for the pantry, £43\r\n17_s._\r\n\r\nFor one hundred and twenty-nine dozen of parchment, with ink, £4 8_s._\r\n3-1/4_d._\r\n\r\nSum, £5230 17_s._ 7-1/4_d._\r\n\r\nItem, for two cloths of scarlet for the earl against Christmass, one\r\ncloth of russet for the Bishop of Angew, seventy cloths of blue for the\r\nknights (as they were then termed), fifteen cloths of medley for the\r\nlords’ clerks, twenty-eight cloths for the esquires, fifteen cloths for\r\nofficers, nineteen cloths for grooms, five cloths for archers, four\r\ncloths for minstrels and carpenters, with the sharing and carriage for\r\nthe earl’s liveries at Christmasse, £460 15_s._\r\n\r\nItem, for seven furs of variable miniver (or powdered ermine), seven\r\nhoods of purple, three hundred and ninety-five furs of budge for the\r\nliveries of barons, knights, and clerks, one hundred and twenty-three\r\nfurs of lamb for esquires, bought at Christmas, £147 17_s._ 8_d._\r\n\r\nItem, sixty-five cloths, saffron colour, for the barons and knights in\r\nsummer, twelve red cloths, mixed, for clerks, twenty-six cloths, ray,\r\nfor esquires, one cloth, ray, for officers’ coats in summer, and four\r\ncloths, ray, for carpets in the hall, for £345 13_s._ 8_d._\r\n\r\nItem, one hundred pieces of green silk for the knights, fourteen budge\r\nfurs for surcoats, thirteen hoods of budge for clerks, and seventy-five\r\nfurs of lambs for the lord’s liveries in summer, with canvas and cords\r\nto truss them, £72 19_s._\r\n\r\nItem, saddles for the lord’s liveries in summer, £51 6_s._ 8_d._\r\n\r\nItem, one saddle for the earl of the prince’s arms, 40_s._\r\n\r\nSum, £1079 18_s._ 3_d._\r\n\r\nItem, for things bought, whereof cannot be read in my note, £241 14_s._\r\n1-1/4_d._\r\n\r\nFor horses lost in service of the earl, £8 6_s._ 8_d._\r\n\r\nFees paid to earls, barons, knights, and esquires, £623 15_s._ 5_d._\r\n\r\nIn gifts to knights of France, the Queen of England’s nurses, to the\r\nCountess of Warren, esquires, minstrels, messengers, and riders, £92\r\n14_s._\r\n\r\nItem, one hundred and sixty-eight yards of russet cloth,[103] and\r\ntwenty-four coats for poor men, with money given to the poor on Maundy\r\nThursday, £8 16_s._ 7_d._\r\n\r\nItem, twenty-four silver dishes, so many saucers and so many cups for\r\nthe buttery, one pair of pater nosters, and one silver coffin, bought\r\nthis year, £103 5_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\nTo divers messengers about the earl’s business, £34 19_s._ 8_d._\r\n\r\nIn the earl’s chamber, £5.\r\n\r\nTo divers men for the earl’s old debts, £88 16_s._ 0-3/4_d._\r\n\r\nSum, £1207 7_s._ 11-3/4_d._\r\n\r\nThe expences of the countess at Pickering for the time of this account,\r\nas in the pantry, buttery, kitchen, and other places, concerning these\r\noffices, £285 13_s._ 0-1/2_d._\r\n\r\nIn wine, wax, spices, cloths, furs, and other things for the countess’\r\nwardrobe, £154 7_s._ 4-1/2_d._\r\n\r\nSum, £439 8_s._ 6-1/4_d._\r\n\r\nSum total of the whole expenses, £7957 13_s._ 4-1/2_d._\r\n\r\nThus much for this Earl of Lancaster.\r\n\r\nMore I read, that in the 14th of the same Edward II., Hugh Spencer the\r\nelder (condemned by the commonalty) was banished the realm; at which\r\ntime it was found by inquisition that the said Spencer had in sundry\r\nshires, fifty-nine manors: he had twenty-eight thousand sheep, one\r\nthousand oxen and steers, one thousand two hundred kine, with their\r\ncalves, forty mares with their colts, one hundred and sixty drawing\r\nhorses, two thousand hogs, three hundred bullocks, forty tuns of wine,\r\nsix hundred bacons, eighty carcases of Martilmasse beef, six hundred\r\nmuttons in larder, ten tuns of cider; his armour, plate, jewels, and\r\nready money, better than £10,000, thirty-six sacks of wool, and a\r\nlibrary of books. Thus much the record, which provision for household\r\nshoweth a great family there to be kept.\r\n\r\nNearer to our time, I read,[104] in the 36th of Henry VI., that the\r\ngreater estates of the realm being called up to London,\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Salisbury came with five hundred men on horseback, and was\r\nlodged in the Herber.\r\n\r\nRichard, Duke of York, with four hundred men, lodged at Baynard’s\r\ncastle.\r\n\r\nThe Dukes of Excester and Sommerset, with eight hundred men.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Northumberland, the Lord Egremont, and the Lord Clifford,\r\nwith fifteen hundred men.\r\n\r\nRichard Nevill, Earl of Warwick, with six hundred men, all in red\r\njackets, embroidered with ragged staves before and behind, and was\r\nlodged in Warwicke lane; in whose house there was oftentimes six oxen\r\neaten at a breakfast, and every tavern was full of his meat; for he that\r\nhad any acquaintance in that house, might have there so much of sodden\r\nand roast meat as he could prick and carry upon a long dagger.\r\n\r\nRichard Redman, Bishop of Ely, 1500, the 17th of Henry VII.,[105]\r\nbesides his great family, housekeeping, alms dish, and relief to the\r\npoor, wheresoever he was lodged. In his travelling, when at his coming\r\nor going to or from any town, the bells being rung, all the poor would\r\ncome together, to whom he gave every one six pence at the least.\r\n\r\nAnd now to note of our own time somewhat. Omitting in this place Thomas\r\nWolsey, Archbishop of Yorke, and cardinal, I refer the reader to my\r\n_Annals_, where I have set down the order of his house and household,\r\npassing all other subjects of his time. His servants, daily attending\r\nin his house, were near about four hundred, omitting his servants’\r\nservants, which were many.\r\n\r\nNicholas West, Bishop of Ely, in the year 1532, kept continually in his\r\nhouse an hundred servants, giving to the one half of them 53_s._ 4_d._\r\nthe piece yearly; to the other half each 40_s._ the piece; to every one\r\nfor his winter gown four yards of broad cloth, and for his summer coat\r\nthree yards and a half: he daily gave at his gates, besides bread and\r\ndrink, warm meat to two hundred poor people.\r\n\r\nThe housekeeping of Edward, late Earl of Derby, is not to be forgotten,\r\nwho had two hundred and twenty men in check roll: his feeding aged\r\npersons twice every day, sixty and odd, besides all comers, thrice a\r\nweek, appointed for his dealing days, and every Good Friday two thousand\r\nseven hundred, with meat, drink, and money.\r\n\r\nThomas Audley, lord chancellor, his family of gentlemen before him, in\r\ncoats garded with velvet, and chains of gold; his yeomen after him in\r\nthe same livery, not garded.\r\n\r\nWilliam Powlet, lord great master, Marquis of Winchester, kept the like\r\nnumber of gentlemen and yeomen in a livery[106] of Reading tawny, and\r\ngreat relief at his gate.\r\n\r\nThomas Lord Cromwell, Earl of Essex, kept the like or greater number in\r\na livery of grey marble; the gentlemen garded with velvet, the yeomen\r\nwith the same cloth, yet their skirts large enough for their friends to\r\nsit upon them.\r\n\r\nEdward, Duke of Sommerset, was not inferior in keeping a number of tall\r\nand comely gentlemen and yeomen, though his house was then in building,\r\nand most of his men were lodged abroad.\r\n\r\nThe late Earl of Oxford, father to him that now liveth, hath been noted\r\nwithin these forty years to have ridden into this city, and so to his\r\nhouse by London stone, with eighty gentlemen in a livery of Reading\r\ntawny, and chains of gold about their necks, before him, and one hundred\r\ntall yeomen, in the like livery, to follow him without chains, but\r\nall having his cognisance of the blue boar embroidered on their left\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[92] Thus Lydgate, in his ballad of _London Lackpenny_:\r\n\r\n    “Then to the Chepe I began me drawne,\r\n      Where much people I saw for to stande:\r\n    One offered me velvet, sylke and lawne,\r\n      An other he taketh me by the hande,\r\n      ‘Here is Pary’s thred the fynest in the lande,’” etc.\r\n\r\n[93] The cooks in Lydgate’s time, as we learn from the same ballad,\r\nresided chiefly in Eastcheap:\r\n\r\n    “Then I hyed me into East Chepe;\r\n      One cryes ribbs of befe, and many a pye:\r\n    Pewter pottes they clattered on a heape;\r\n      There was harpe, pype and mynstrelsye,” etc.\r\n\r\n[94] “Pater noster beade-makers and text-writers are gone out of\r\nPaternoster rowe into stationers of Paule’s churchyard.”--_1st edition_,\r\np. 63.\r\n\r\n[95] Thomas Clifford.\r\n\r\n[96] Liber Constitutionis.

I\r\nmyself, in that declining time of charity, have oft seen at the Lord\r\nCromwell’s gate in London more than two hundred persons served twice\r\nevery day with bread, meat, and drink sufficient; for he observed that\r\nancient and charitable custom, as all prelates, noblemen, or men of\r\nhonour and worship, his predecessors, had done before him; whereof\r\nsomewhat to note for example, Venerable Bede writeth, that prelates of\r\nhis time having peradventure but wooden churches, had notwithstanding on\r\ntheir board at their meals one alms dish, into the which was carved some\r\ngood portion of meat out of every other dish brought to their table; all\r\nwhich was given to the poor, besides the fragments left, in so much as\r\nin a hard time, a poor prelate wanting victuals, hath caused his alms\r\ndish, being silver, to be divided among the poor, therewith to shift as\r\nthey could, till God should send them better store.\r\n\r\nSuch a prelate was Ethelwald, Bishop of Winchester, in the reign of King\r\nEdgar, about the year of Christ 963: he in a great famine sold away\r\nall the sacred vessels of his church for to relieve the almost starved\r\npeople, saying that there was no reason that the senseless temples of\r\nGod should abound in riches, and lively temples of the Holy Ghost to\r\nlack it.\r\n\r\nWalter de Suffilde, Bishop of Norwich, was of the like mind; about\r\nthe year 1245, in a time of great dearth, he sold all his plate, and\r\ndistributed it to the poor every pennyworth.\r\n\r\nRobert Winchelsey, Archbishop of Canterbury, about the year 1293,\r\nbesides the daily fragments of his house, gave every Friday and Sunday,\r\nunto every beggar that came to his gate, a loaf of bread sufficient\r\nfor that day, and there more usually, every such alms day, in time of\r\ndearth, to the number of five thousand, and otherwise four thousand, at\r\nthe least; more, he used every great festival day to give one hundred\r\nand fifty pence to so many poor people, to send daily meat, bread, and\r\ndrink, to such as by age or sickness were not able to fetch his alms,\r\nand to send meat, money, and apparel to such as he thought needed it.\r\n\r\nI read,[107] in 1171, that Henry II., after his return into England,\r\ndid penance for the slaughter of Thomas Becket, of whom (a sore dearth\r\nincreasing) ten thousand persons, from the first of April, till new corn\r\nwas inned, were daily fed and sustained.\r\n\r\nMore, I find recorded,[108] that in the year 1236, the 20th of Henry\r\nIII., William de Haverhull, the king’s treasurer, was commanded, that\r\nupon the day of the Circumcision of our Lord, six thousand poor people\r\nshould be fed at Westminster, for the state of the king, queen, and\r\ntheir children. The like commandment the said King Henry gave to Hugh\r\nGifford and William Browne, that upon Friday next after the Epiphany,\r\nthey should cause to be fed in the great hall at Windsore, at a good\r\nfire, all the poor and needy children that could be found, and the\r\nking’s children being weighed and measured, their weight and measure to\r\nbe distributed for their good estates. These few examples for charity of\r\nkings may suffice.\r\n\r\nI read, in the reign of Edward III., that Richard de Berie, Bishop of\r\nDurham, did weekly bestow for the relief of the poor eight quarters of\r\nwheat made into bread, besides his alms dish, fragments of his house,\r\nand great sums of money given to the poor when he journeyed. And that\r\nthese alms dishes were as well used at the tables of noblemen as of the\r\nprelates, one note may suffice in this place.\r\n\r\nI read, in the year 1452, that Richard, Duke of York, then claiming\r\nthe crown, the Lord Rivers should have passed the sea about the king’s\r\nbusiness, but staying at Plimmoth till his money was spent, and then\r\nsending for more, the Duke of Sommerset sent him the image of St. George\r\nin silver and gold, to be sold, with the alms dish of the Duke of\r\nGlocester, which was also of great price, for coin had they none.\r\n\r\nTo end of orders and customs in this city, also of great families kept\r\nby honourable persons thither repairing, and of charitable alms of\r\nold times given, I say, for conclusion, that all noble persons, and\r\nother of honour and worship, in former times lodging in this city, or\r\nliberties thereof, did without grudging bear their parts in charges with\r\nthe citizens, according to their estimated estates, as I have before\r\nsaid, and could prove by examples; but let men call to mind Sir Thomas\r\nCromwel, then lord privy seal and vicar-general, lying in the city of\r\nLondon; he bare his charges to the great muster there in A.D. 1539; he\r\nsent his men in great number to the Miles end, and after them their\r\narmour in cars, with their coats of white cloth, the arms of this city;\r\nto wit, a red cross, and a sword, on the breast and back; which armour\r\nand coats they ware amongst the citizens, without any difference, and\r\nmarched through the city to Westminster.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[106] Every livery coat had three yards of broad cloth.--_Stow._\r\n\r\n[107] Pater de Ioham.\r\n\r\n[108] Record of the Tower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPORTS AND PASTIMES OF OLD TIME USED IN THIS CITY\r\n\r\n\r\n“Let us now,” saith Fitzstephen, “come to the sports and pastimes,\r\nseeing it is fit that a city should not only be commodious and serious,\r\nbut also merry and sportful; whereupon in the seals of the popes, until\r\nthe time of Pope Leo, on the one side was St. Peter fishing, with a key\r\nover him, reached as it were by the hand of God out of heaven, and about\r\nit this verse:\r\n\r\n    ‘Tu pro me navem liquisti, suscipe clavem.’\r\n\r\nAnd on the other side was a city, and this inscription on it: ‘_Aurea\r\nRoma_.’ Likewise to the praise of Augustus Cæsar and the city, in\r\nrespect of the shows and sports, was written:\r\n\r\n    ‘Nocte pluit tota, redeunt spectacula mane,’ etc.\r\n\r\n    ‘All night it raines, and shews at morrow tide returne again,\r\n    And Cæsar with almighty Jove hath matcht an equal raign.’\r\n\r\n“But London, for the shows upon theatres, and comical pastimes, hath\r\nholy plays, representations of miracles, which holy confessors have\r\nwrought, or representations of torments wherein the constancy of martyrs\r\nappeared. Every year also at Shrove Tuesday, that we may begin with\r\nchildren’s sports, seeing we all have been children, the school-boys\r\ndo bring cocks of the game to their master, and all the forenoon they\r\ndelight themselves in cock-fighting: after dinner, all the youths go\r\ninto the fields to play at the ball.\r\n\r\n“The scholars of every school have their ball, or baston, in their\r\nhands; the ancient and wealthy men of the city come forth on horseback\r\nto see the sport of the young men, and to take part of the pleasure in\r\nbeholding their agility. Every Friday in Lent a fresh company of young\r\nmen comes into the field on horseback, and the best horseman conducteth\r\nthe rest. Then march forth the citizens’ sons, and other young men,\r\nwith disarmed lances and shields, and there they practice feats of war.\r\nMany courtiers likewise, when the king lieth near, and attendants of\r\nnoblemen, do repair to these exercises; and while the hope of victory\r\ndoth inflame their minds, do show good proof how serviceable they would\r\nbe in martial affairs.\r\n\r\n“In Easter holidays they fight battles on the water; a shield is hung\r\nupon a pole, fixed in the midst of the stream, a boat is prepared\r\nwithout oars, to be carried by violence of the water, and in the fore\r\npart thereof standeth a young man, ready to give charge upon the shield\r\nwith his lance; if so be he breaketh his lance against the shield, and\r\ndoth not fall, he is thought to have performed a worthy deed; if so be,\r\nwithout breaking his lance, he runneth strongly against the shield,\r\ndown he falleth into the water, for the boat is violently forced with\r\nthe tide; but on each side of the shield ride two boats, furnished with\r\nyoung men, which recover him that falleth as soon as they may. Upon the\r\nbridge, wharfs, and houses, by the river’s side, stand great numbers to\r\nsee and laugh thereat.\r\n\r\n“In the holidays all the summer the youths are exercised in leaping,\r\ndancing, shooting, wrestling, casting the stone, and practising their\r\nshields; the maidens trip in their timbrels, and dance as long as they\r\ncan well see. In winter, every holiday before dinner, the boars prepared\r\nfor brawn are set to fight, or else bulls and bears are baited.\r\n\r\n“When the great fen, or moor, which watereth the walls of the city on\r\nthe north side, is frozen, many young men play upon the ice; some,\r\nstriding as wide as they may, do slide swiftly; others make themselves\r\nseats of ice, as great as millstones; one sits down, many hand in hand\r\ndo draw him, and one slipping on a sudden, all fall together; some tie\r\nbones to their feet and under their heels; and shoving themselves by a\r\nlittle picked staff, do slide as swiftly as a bird flieth in the air,\r\nor an arrow out of a cross-bow. Sometime two run together with poles,\r\nand hitting one the other, either one or both do fall, not without\r\nhurt; some break their arms, some their legs, but youth desirous of\r\nglory in this sort exerciseth itself against the time of war. Many of\r\nthe citizens do delight themselves in hawks and hounds; for they have\r\nliberty of hunting in Middlesex, Hartfordshire, all Chiltron, and in\r\nKent to the water of Cray.” Thus far Fitzstephen of sports.\r\n\r\nThese, or the like exercises, have been continued till our time,\r\nnamely, in stage plays, whereof ye may read in anno 1391, a play by\r\nthe parish clerks of London at the Skinner’s well besides Smithfield,\r\nwhich continued three days together, the king, queen, and nobles of the\r\nrealm being present. And of another, in the year 1409, which lasted\r\neight days, and was of matter from the creation of the world, whereat\r\nwas present most part of the nobility and gentry of England. Of late\r\ntime, in place of those stage plays, hath been used comedies, tragedies,\r\ninterludes, and histories, both true and feigned; for the acting whereof\r\ncertain public places[109] have been erected. Also cocks of the game are\r\nyet cherished by divers men for their pleasures, much money being laid\r\non their heads, when they fight in pits, whereof some be costly made\r\nfor that purpose. The ball is used by noblemen and gentlemen in tennis\r\ncourts, and by people of meaner sort in the open fields and streets.\r\n\r\nThe marching forth of citizens’ sons, and other young men on horseback,\r\nwith disarmed lances and shields, there to practise feats of war, man\r\nagainst man, hath long since been left off, but in their stead they\r\nhave used on horseback to run at a dead mark, called a quinten; for\r\nnote whereof I read,[110] that in the year of Christ 1253, the 38th of\r\nHenry III., the youthful citizens, for an exercise of their activity,\r\nset forth a game to run at the quinten; and whoever did best should\r\nhave a peacock, which they had prepared as a prize. Certain of the\r\nking’s servants, because the court lay then at Westminster came, as it\r\nwere, in spite of the citizens, to that game, and giving reproachful\r\nnames to the Londoners, which for the dignity of the city, and ancient\r\nprivilege which they ought to have enjoyed, were called barons, the\r\nsaid Londoners, not able to bear so to be misused, fell upon the king’s\r\nservants, and beat them shrewdly, so that upon complaint to the king he\r\nfined the citizens to pay a thousand marks. This exercise of running at\r\nthe quinten was practised by the youthful citizens as well in summer as\r\nin winter, namely, in the feast of Christmas, I have seen a quinten set\r\nupon Cornehill, by the Leaden hall, where the attendants on the lords of\r\nmerry disports have run, and made great pastime; for he that hit not\r\nthe broad end of the quinten was of all men laughed to scorn, and he\r\nthat hit it full, if he rid not the faster, had a sound blow in his neck\r\nwith a bag full of sand hung on the other end. I have also in the summer\r\nseason seen some upon the river of Thames rowed in wherries, with staves\r\nin their hands, flat at the fore end, running one against another, and\r\nfor the most part, one or both overthrown, and well ducked.\r\n\r\nOn the holy days in summer the youths of this city have in the field\r\nexercised themselves in leaping, dancing, shooting, wrestling, casting\r\nof the stone or ball, etc.\r\n\r\nAnd for defence and use of the weapon, there is a special profession of\r\nmen that teach it. Ye may read in mine _Annals_ how that in the year\r\n1222 the citizens kept games of defence, and wrestlings, near unto the\r\nhospital of St. Giles in the field, where they challenged, and had the\r\nmastery of the men in the suburbs, and other commoners, etc. Also, in\r\nthe year 1453, of a tumult made against the mayor at the wrestling\r\nbesides Clearke’s well, etc. Which is sufficient to prove that of old\r\ntime the exercising of wrestling, and such like, hath been much more\r\nused than of later years. The youths of this city also have used on holy\r\ndays after evening prayer, at their masters’ doors, to exercise their\r\nwasters and bucklers; and the maidens, one of them playing on a timbrel,\r\nin sight of their masters and dames, to dance for garlands hung athwart\r\nthe streets; which open pastimes in my youth being now suppressed,\r\nworse practices within doors are to be feared. As for the baiting of\r\nbulls and bears, they are to this day much frequented, namely, in Bear\r\ngardens,[111] on the Bank’s side, wherein be prepared scaffolds for\r\nbeholders to stand upon. Sliding upon the ice is now but children’s\r\nplay; but in hawking and hunting many grave citizens at this present\r\nhave great delight, and do rather want leisure than goodwill to follow\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOf triumphant shows made by the citizens of London, ye may read,[112] in\r\nthe year 1236, the 20th of Henry III., Andrew Bockwell then being mayor,\r\nhow Helianor, daughter to Reymond, Earl of Provance, riding through the\r\ncity towards Westminster, there to be crowned queen of England, the city\r\nwas adorned with silks, and in the night with lamps, cressets, and other\r\nlights without number, besides many pageants and strange devices there\r\npresented; the citizens also rode to meet the king and queen, clothed in\r\nlong garments embroidered about with gold, and silks of divers colours,\r\ntheir horses gallantly trapped to the number of three hundred and sixty,\r\nevery man bearing a cup of gold or silver in his hand, and the king’s\r\ntrumpeters sounding before them. These citizens did minister wine, as\r\nbottelers, which is their service, at their coronation. More, in the\r\nyear 1293, for victory obtained by Edward I. against the Scots, every\r\ncitizen, according to their several trade, made their several show, but\r\nespecially the fishmongers, which in a solemn procession passed through\r\nthe city, having, amongst other pageants and shows, four sturgeons gilt,\r\ncarried on four horses; then four salmons of silver on four horses; and\r\nafter them six and forty armed knights riding on horses, made like luces\r\nof the sea; and then one representing St. Magnus, because it was upon\r\nSt. Magnus’ day, with a thousand horsemen, etc.\r\n\r\nOne other show, in the year 1377, made by the citizens for disport of\r\nthe young prince, Richard, son to the Black Prince, in the feast of\r\nChristmas, in this manner:--On the Sunday before Candlemas, in the\r\nnight, one hundred and thirty citizens, disguised, and well horsed,\r\nin a mummery, with sound of trumpets, sackbuts, cornets, shalmes,\r\nand other minstrels, and innumerable torch lights of wax, rode from\r\nNewgate, through Cheape, over the bridge, through Southwarke, and so to\r\nKennington beside Lambhith, where the young prince remained with his\r\nmother and the Duke of Lancaster his uncle, the Earls of Cambridge,\r\nHertford, Warwicke, and Suffolke, with divers other lords. In the first\r\nrank did ride forty-eight in the likeness and habit of esquires, two\r\nand two together, clothed in red coats and gowns of say or sandal, with\r\ncomely visors on their faces; after them came riding forty-eight knights\r\nin the same livery of colour and stuff; then followed one richly arrayed\r\nlike an emperor; and after him some distance, one stately attired like\r\na pope, whom followed twenty-four cardinals, and after them eight or\r\nten with black visors, not amiable, as if they had been legates from\r\nsome foreign princes. These maskers, after they had entered Kennington,\r\nalighted from their horses, and entered the hall on foot; which done,\r\nthe prince, his mother, and the lords, came out of the chamber into the\r\nhall, whom the said mummers did salute, showing by a pair of dice upon\r\nthe table their desire to play with the prince, which they so handled\r\nthat the prince did always win when he cast them. Then the mummers set\r\nto the prince three jewels, one after another, which were a bowl of\r\ngold, a cup of gold, and a ring of gold, which the prince won at three\r\ncasts. Then they set to the prince’s mother, the duke, the earls, and\r\nother lords, to every one a ring of gold, which they did also win. After\r\nwhich they were feasted, and the music sounded, the prince and lords\r\ndanced on the one part with the mummers, which did also dance; which\r\njollity being ended, they were again made to drink, and then departed in\r\norder as they came.\r\n\r\nThe like was in Henry IV., in the 2nd of his reign, he then keeping his\r\nChristmas at Eltham, twelve aldermen of London and their sons rode in a\r\nmumming, and had great thanks.\r\n\r\nThus much for sportful shows in triumphs may suffice. Now for sports and\r\npastimes yearly used.\r\n\r\nFirst, in the feast of Christmas, there was in the king’s house,\r\nwheresoever he was lodged, a lord of misrule, or master of merry\r\ndisports,[113] and the like had ye in the house of every nobleman of\r\nhonour or good worship, were he spiritual or temporal. Amongst the which\r\nthe mayor of London, and either of the sheriffs, had their several lords\r\nof misrule, ever contending, without quarrel or offence, who should make\r\nthe rarest pastimes to delight the beholders. These lords beginning\r\ntheir rule on Alhollon eve, continued the same till the morrow after the\r\nFeast of the Purification, commonly called Candlemas day. In all which\r\nspace there were fine and subtle disguisings, masks, and mummeries, with\r\nplaying at cards for counters, nails, and points, in every house, more\r\nfor pastime than for gain.\r\n\r\nAgainst the feast of Christmas every man’s house, as also the parish\r\nchurches, were decked with holm, ivy, bays, and whatsoever the season\r\nof the year afforded to be green. The conduits and standards in the\r\nstreets were likewise garnished; amongst the which I read, in the year\r\n1444, that by tempest of thunder and lightning, on the 1st of February,\r\nat night, Powle’s steeple was fired, but with great labour quenched; and\r\ntowards the morning of Candlemas day, at the Leaden hall in Cornhill,\r\na standard of tree being set up in midst of the pavement, fast in the\r\nground, nailed full of holm and ivy, for disport of Christmas to the\r\npeople, was torn up, and cast down by the malignant spirit (as was\r\nthought), and the stones of the pavement all about were cast in the\r\nstreets, and into divers houses, so that the people were sore aghast of\r\nthe great tempests.\r\n\r\nIn the week before Easter had ye great shows made for the fetching in\r\nof a twisted tree, or with, as they termed it, out of the woods into the\r\nking’s house; and the like into every man’s house of honour or worship.\r\n\r\nIn the month of May, namely, on May-day in the morning, every man,\r\nexcept impediment, would walk into the sweet meadows and green woods,\r\nthere to rejoice their spirits with the beauty and savour of sweet\r\nflowers, and with the harmony of birds, praising God in their kind; and\r\nfor example hereof, Edward Hall hath noted, that King Henry VIII., as\r\nin the 3rd of his reign, and divers other years, so namely, in the 7th\r\nof his reign, on May-day in the morning, with Queen Katherine his wife,\r\naccompanied with many lords and ladies, rode a-maying from Greenwitch\r\nto the high ground of Shooter’s hill, where, as they passed by the way,\r\nthey espied a company of tall yeomen, clothed all in green, with green\r\nhoods, and bows and arrows, to the number of two hundred; one being\r\ntheir chieftain, was called Robin Hoode, who required the king and his\r\ncompany to stay and see his men shoot; whereunto the king granting,\r\nRobin Hoode whistled, and all the two hundred archers shot off, loosing\r\nall at once; and when he whistled again they likewise shot again; their\r\narrows whistled by craft of the head, so that the noise was strange\r\nand loud, which greatly delighted the king, queen, and their company.\r\nMoreover, this Robin Hoode desired the king and queen, with their\r\nretinue, to enter the green wood, where, in harbours made of boughs, and\r\ndecked with flowers, they were set and served plentifully with venison\r\nand wine by Robin Hoode and his men, to their great contentment, and had\r\nother pageants and pastimes, as ye may read in my said author.\r\n\r\nI find also, that in the month of May, the citizens of London of all\r\nestates, lightly in every parish, or sometimes two or three parishes\r\njoining together, had their several mayings, and did fetch in May-poles,\r\nwith divers warlike shows, with good archers, morris dancers, and other\r\ndevices, for pastime all the day long; and toward the evening they had\r\nstage plays, and bonfires in the streets. Of these mayings we read,\r\nin the reign of Henry VI., that the aldermen and sheriffs of London,\r\nbeing on May-day at the Bishop of London’s wood, in the parish of\r\nStebunheath,[114] and having there a worshipful dinner for themselves\r\nand other commoners, Lydgate the poet, that was a monk of Bury, sent to\r\nthem, by a pursuivant, a joyful commendation of that season, containing\r\nsixteen staves of metre royal, beginning thus:--\r\n\r\n    “Mightie Flora! goddess of fresh flowers,--\r\n      Which clothed hath the soyle in lustie greene,\r\n    Made buds spring, with her sweete showers,\r\n      By the influence of the sunne shine.\r\n    To doe pleasance of intent full cleane,\r\n      Unto the States which now sit here,\r\n    Hath Vere downe sent her owne daughter deare.\r\n\r\n    Making the vertue, that dared in the roote,\r\n      Called of clarkes the vertue vegitable,\r\n    For to transcend, most holsome and most soote,\r\n      Into the crop, this season so agreeable,\r\n    The bawmy liquor is so commendable,\r\n      That it rejoyceth with his fresh moysture,\r\n    Man, beast, and fowle, and every creature,” etc.\r\n\r\nThese great Mayings and May-games, made by the governors and masters\r\nof this city, with the triumphant setting up of the great shaft (a\r\nprincipal May-pole in Cornehill, before the parish church of St.\r\nAndrew), therefore called Undershaft, by means of an insurrection of\r\nyouths against aliens on May-day, 1517, the 9th of Henry VIII., have\r\nnot been so freely used as afore, and therefore I leave them, and will\r\nsomewhat touch of watches, as also of shows in the night.[115]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[109] “As the Theater, the Curtine,” etc.--_1st edition._\r\n\r\n[110] Matthew Paris.\r\n\r\n[111] The Bear garden on the Bankside is not mentioned in the first\r\nedition.\r\n\r\n[112] Matthew Paris.\r\n\r\n[113] In the edition of Brand’s _Popular Antiquities_, edited by Sir\r\nHenry Ellis, vol. i. 272-278, will be found a very large and curious\r\ncollection of materials illustrative of this ancient custom.\r\n\r\n[114] Stepney.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF WATCHES IN THIS CITY, AND OTHER MATTERS COMMANDED, AND THE CAUSE WHY\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Conqueror commanded that in every town and village, a bell\r\nshould be nightly rung at eight o’clock, and that all people should then\r\nput out their fire and candle, and take their rest; which order was\r\nobserved through this realm during his reign, and the reign of William\r\nRufus. But Henry I., restoring to his subjects the use of fire and\r\nlights, as afore; it followeth, by reason of wars within the realm, that\r\nmany men also gave themselves to robbery and murders in the night; for\r\nexample whereof in this city Roger Hoveden writeth thus:--“In the year\r\n1175, council was kept at Nottingham; in time of which council a brother\r\nof the Earl Ferrers being in the night privily slain at London, and\r\nthrown out of his inn into the dirty street, when the king understood\r\nthereof, he swore that he would be avenged on the citizens. For it was\r\nthen (saith mine author) a common practice in the city, that a hundred\r\nor more in a company, young and old, would make nightly invasions upon\r\nhouses of the wealthy, to the intent to rob them; and if they found any\r\nman stirring in the city within the night that were not of their crew,\r\nthey would presently murder him, insomuch that when night was come no\r\nman durst adventure to walk in the streets. When this had continued\r\nlong, it fortuned that as a crew of young and wealthy citizens,\r\nassembling together in the night, assaulted a stone house of a certain\r\nrich man, and breaking through the wall, the good man of that house,\r\nhaving prepared himself with others in a corner, when he perceived one\r\nof the thieves named Andrew Bucquint to lead the way, with a burning\r\nbrand in the one hand, and a pot of coals in the other, which he essayed\r\nto kindle with the brand, he flew upon him, and smote off his right\r\nhand, and then with a loud voice cried ‘Thieves!’ at the hearing whereof\r\nthe thieves took their flight, all saving he that had lost his hand,\r\nwhom the good man in the next morning delivered to Richard de Lucie,\r\nthe king’s justice. This thief, upon warrant of his life, appeached his\r\nconfederates, of whom many were taken, and many were fled. Among the\r\nrest that were apprehended, a certain citizen of great countenance,\r\ncredit, and wealth, named John Senex,[116] who forasmuch as he could not\r\nacquit himself by the water dome, as that law was then, he offered to\r\nthe king five hundred pounds of silver for his life; but forasmuch as\r\nhe was condemned by judgment of the water, the king would not take the\r\noffer, but commanded him to be hanged on the gallows, which was done,\r\nand then the city became more quiet for a long time after.” But for a\r\nfull remedy of enormities in the night I read, that in the year 1253,\r\nHenry III. commanded watches in the cities and borough towns to be kept,\r\nfor the better observing of peace and quietness amongst his people.\r\n\r\nAnd further, by the advice of them of Savoy, he ordained, that if any\r\nman chanced to be robbed, or by any means damnified by any thief or\r\nrobber, he to whom the charge of keeping that country, city, or borough,\r\nchiefly appertained, where the robbery was done, should competently\r\nrestore the loss. And this was after the use of Savoy, but yet thought\r\nmore hard to be observed here than in those parts; and, therefore,\r\nleaving those laborious watches, I will speak of our pleasures and\r\npastimes in watching by night.\r\n\r\nIn the months of June and July, on the vigils of festival days, and on\r\nthe same festival days in the evenings after the sun setting, there were\r\nusually made bonfires in the streets, every man bestowing wood or labour\r\ntowards them; the wealthier sort also, before their doors near to the\r\nsaid bonfires, would set out tables on the vigils, furnished with sweet\r\nbread and good drink, and on the festival days with meats and drinks\r\nplentifully, whereunto they would invite their neighbours and passengers\r\nalso to sit and be merry with them in great familiarity, praising God\r\nfor his benefits bestowed on them. These were called bonfires as well\r\nof good amity amongst neighbours that being before at controversy, were\r\nthere, by the labour of others, reconciled, and made of bitter enemies\r\nloving friends; and also for the virtue that a great fire hath to purge\r\nthe infection of the air. On the vigil of St. John the Baptist, and on\r\nSt. Peter and Paul the apostles, every man’s door being shadowed with\r\ngreen birch, long fennel, St. John’s wort, orpin, white lilies, and\r\nsuch like, garnished upon with garlands of beautiful flowers, had also\r\nlamps of glass, with oil burning in them all the night; some hung out\r\nbranches of iron curiously wrought, containing hundreds of lamps alight\r\nat once, which made a goodly show, namely in New Fish street, Thames\r\nstreet, etc. Then had ye besides the standing watches all in bright\r\nharness, in every ward and street of this city and suburbs, a marching\r\nwatch, that passed through the principal streets thereof, to wit, from\r\nthe little conduit by Paule’s gate to West Cheape, by the stocks through\r\nCornhill, by Leaden hall to Aldgate, then back down Fenchurch street, by\r\nGrasse church, about Grasse church conduit, and up Grasse church street\r\ninto Cornhill, and through it into West Cheape again. The whole way for\r\nthis marching watch extendeth to three thousand two hundred tailor’s\r\nyards of assize; for the furniture whereof with lights, there were\r\nappointed seven hundred cressets, five hundred of them being found by\r\nthe companies, the other two hundred by the chamber of London. Besides\r\nthe which lights every constable in London, in number more than two\r\nhundred and forty,[117] had his cresset: the charge of every cresset\r\nwas in light two shillings and four pence, and every cresset had two\r\nmen, one to bear or hold it, another to bear a bag with light, and to\r\nserve it, so that the poor men pertaining to the cressets, taking wages,\r\nbesides that every one had a straw hat, with a badge painted, and his\r\nbreakfast in the mornings amounted in number to almost two thousand.\r\nThe marching watch contained in number about two thousand men, part of\r\nthem being old soldiers of skill, to be captains, lieutenants,\r\nserjeants, corporals, etc., wiflers, drummers, and fifes, standard and\r\nensign bearers, sword players, trumpeters on horseback, demilances on\r\ngreat horses, gunners with hand guns, or half hakes, archers in coats\r\nof white fustian, signed on the breast and back with the arms of the\r\ncity, their bows bent in their hands, with sheaves of arrows by their\r\nsides, pike-men in bright corslets, burganets, etc., halberds, the like\r\nbill-men in almaine rivets, and apernes of mail in great number; there\r\nwere also divers pageants, morris dancers, constables, the one-half,\r\nwhich was one hundred and twenty, on St. John’s eve, the other half\r\non St. Peter’s eve, in bright harness, some overgilt, and every one a\r\njornet[118] of scarlet thereupon, and a chain of gold, his henchman\r\nfollowing him, his minstrels before him, and his cresset light passing\r\nby him, the waits of the city, the mayor’s officers for his guard before\r\nhim, all in a livery of worsted, or say jackets party-coloured, the\r\nmayor himself well mounted on horseback, the swordbearer before him in\r\nfair armour well mounted also, the mayor’s footmen, and the like torch\r\nbearers about him, henchmen twain upon great stirring horses, following\r\nhim. The sheriffs’ watches came one after the other in like order, but\r\nnot so large in number as the mayor’s; for where the mayor had besides\r\nhis giant three pageants, each of the sheriffs had besides their giants\r\nbut two pageants, each their morris dance, and one henchman, their\r\nofficers in jackets of worsted or say, party-coloured, differing from\r\nthe mayor’s, and each from other, but having harnessed men a great many,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThis midsummer watch was thus accustomed yearly, time out of mind, until\r\nthe year 1539, the 31st of Henry VIII., in which year, on the 8th of\r\nMay, a great muster was made by the citizens at the Mile’s end, all\r\nin bright harness, with coats of white silk, or cloth and chains of\r\ngold, in three great battles, to the number of fifteen thousand, which\r\npassed through London to Westminster, and so through the Sanctuary, and\r\nround about the park of St. James, and returned home through Oldborne.\r\nKing Henry, then considering the great charges of the citizens for the\r\nfurniture of this unusual muster, forbad the marching watch provided for\r\nat Midsummer for that year, which being once laid down, was not raised\r\nagain till the year 1548, the 2nd of Edward VI., Sir John Gresham then\r\nbeing mayor, who caused the marching watch, both on the eve of St.\r\nJohn the Baptist and of St. Peter the Apostle, to be revived and set\r\nforth in as comely order as it hath been accustomed, which watch was\r\nalso beautified by the number of more than three hundred demilances and\r\nlight horsemen, prepared by the citizens to be sent into Scotland for\r\nthe rescue of the town of Hadington, and others kept by the Englishmen.\r\nSince this mayor’s time, the like marching watch in this city hath not\r\nbeen used, though some attempts have been made thereunto; as in the year\r\n1585, a book was drawn by a grave citizen,[119] and by him dedicated to\r\nSir Thomas Pullison, then lord mayor, and his brethren the aldermen,\r\ncontaining the manner and order of a marching watch in the city upon the\r\nevens accustomed; in commendation whereof, namely, in times of peace\r\nto be used, he hath words to this effect: “The artificers of sundry\r\nsorts were thereby well set a-work, none but rich men charged, poor men\r\nhelped, old soldiers, trumpeters, drummers, fifes, and ensign-bearers,\r\nwith such like men, meet for princes’ service, kept in ure, wherein the\r\nsafety and defence of every common weal consisteth. Armour and weapon\r\nbeing yearly occupied in this wise, the citizens had of their own\r\nreadily prepared for any need; whereas by intermission hereof, armourers\r\nare out of work, soldiers out of pay, weapons overgrown with foulness,\r\nfew or none good being provided,” etc.\r\n\r\nIn the month of August, about the feast of St. Bartholomew the Apostle,\r\nbefore the Lord Mayor, aldermen, and sheriffs of London, placed in a\r\nlarge tent near unto Clarkenwell, of old time, were divers days spent\r\nin the pastime of wrestling, where the officers of the city, namely,\r\nthe sheriffs, sergeants, and yeomen, the porters of the king’s beam or\r\nweigh-house, now no such men, and other of the city, were challengers\r\nof all men in the suburbs, to wrestle for games appointed, and on other\r\ndays, before the said mayor, aldermen, and sheriffs, in Fensburie\r\nfield, to shoot the standard, broad arrow, and flight, for games; but\r\nnow of late years the wrestling is only practised on Bartholomew’s day\r\nin the afternoon, and the shooting some three or four days after, in\r\none afternoon, and no more. What should I speak of the ancient daily\r\nexercises in the long bow by citizens of this city, now almost clean\r\nleft off and forsaken?--I overpass it; for by the mean of closing in the\r\ncommon grounds, our archers, for want of room to shoot abroad, creep\r\ninto bowling alleys, and ordinary dicing houses, nearer home, where\r\nthey have room enough to hazard their money at unlawful games; and there\r\nI leave them to take their pleasures.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[115] A paper by Mr. Saunders, in Knight’s _London_, i. 169, entitled,\r\n“The Old Spring Time in London,” forms a very agreeable commentary on\r\nthis section of our author’s work.\r\n\r\n[116] Rich thieves most worthy to be hanged.

The matrons of this city are the very modest Sabine\r\nladies of Italy. The Londoners, sometime called Trinobantes, repelled\r\nCæsar, which always made his passage by shedding blood; whereupon Lucan\r\nsung:\r\n\r\n    ‘Territa quæsitis ostendit terga Britannis.’\r\n\r\n“The city of London hath bred some which have subdued many kingdoms,\r\nand also the Roman empire. It hath also brought forth many others, whom\r\nvirtue and valour hath highly advanced; according to Apollo, in his\r\nOracle to Brute, ‘_Sub occasu solis_,’ etc. In the time of Christianity,\r\nit brought forth that noble emperor, Constantine, which gave the city of\r\nRome and all the imperial ensigns to God, St. Peter, and Pope Silvester;\r\nchoosing rather to be called a defender of the church than an emperor;\r\nand, lest peace might be violated, and their eyes troubled by his\r\npresence, he retired from Rome, and built the city of Constantinople.\r\nLondon also in late time hath brought forth famous kings: Maude the\r\nempress, King Henry, son to Henry II., and Thomas the Archbishop,” etc.\r\n\r\nThis Thomas, surnamed Becket, born in London, brought up in the priory\r\nof Marton, student at Paris, became the sheriff’s clerk of London for\r\na time, then parson of St. Mary hill, had a prebend at London, another\r\nat Lincoln, studied the law at Bononie, etc., was made Chancellor of\r\nEngland, and Archbishop of Canterbury, etc. Unto this might be added\r\ninnumerable persons of honour, wisdom, and virtue, born in London; but\r\nof actions done by worthy citizens I will only note a few, and so to\r\nother matters.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of London, time out of mind, founded an hospital of St.\r\nJames in the fields for leprous women of their city.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1197, Walter Brune, a citizen of London, and Rosia, his\r\nwife, founded the hospital of our Lady, called Domus Dei, or St. Marie\r\nSpittle, without Bishopsgate of London; a house of such relief to the\r\nneedy, that there was found standing at the surrender thereof nine score\r\nbeds, well furnished for receipt of poor people.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1216, the Londoners sending out a navy, took ninety-five\r\nships of pirates and sea-robbers; besides innumerable others that they\r\ndrowned, which had robbed on the river of Thames.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1247, Simon Fitzmary, one of the sheriffs of London, founded\r\nthe hospital of St. Mary called Bethlem, and without Bishopsgate.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1283, Henry Wallice, then mayor, built the Tun upon\r\nCornhill, to be a prison for night-walkers, and a market-house called\r\nthe Stocks, both for fish and flesh, standing in the midst of the city.\r\nHe also built divers houses on the west and north side of Paule’s\r\nchurchyard; the profits of all which buildings are to the maintenance of\r\nLondon Bridge.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1332, William Elsing, mercer of London, founded Elsing\r\nSpittle within Cripplegate, for sustentation of an hundred poor blind\r\nmen, and became himself the first prior of that hospital.\r\n\r\nSir John Poultney, draper, four times mayor, in 1337 built a fair chapel\r\nin Paule’s church, wherein he was buried. He founded a college in the\r\nparish church of St. Laurence, called Poultney: he built the parish\r\nchurch called Little Alhallowes, in Thames street; the Carmelite friars\r\nchurch in Coventry: he gave relief to prisoners in Newgate and in the\r\nFleet, and ten shillings a-year to St. Giles’ hospital by Oldborne for\r\never, and other legacies long to rehearse.\r\n\r\nJohn Stodie, vintner, mayor 1358, gave to the vintners all the quadrant\r\nwherein the Vintners’ hall now standeth, with all the tenements round\r\nabout, from Stadies lane, wherein is founded thirteen alms houses for so\r\nmany poor people, etc.\r\n\r\nHenry Picard, vintner, mayor 1357, in the year 1363, did in one day\r\nsumptuously feast Edward III., king of England, John, king of France,\r\nDavid, king of Scots, the king of Cyprus, then all in England, Edward,\r\nprince of Wales, with many other noblemen, and after kept his hall\r\nfor all comers that were willing to play at dice and hazard. The Lady\r\nMargaret, his wife, kept her chamber to the same effect, etc.\r\n\r\nJohn Lofken, fishmonger, four times mayor, 1367, built an hospital\r\ncalled Magdalen’s, in Kingstone upon Thames; gave thereunto nine\r\ntenements, ten shops, one mill, one hundred and twenty-five acres of\r\nland, ten acres of meadow, one hundred and twenty acres of pasture,\r\netc.; more, in London, he built the fair parish church of St. Michael in\r\nCrooked lane, and was there buried.\r\n\r\nJohn Barnes, mayor 1371, gave a chest with three locks, and one thousand\r\nmarks therein, to be lent to young men upon sufficient pawn, and for\r\nthe use thereof, to say _De profundis_, or _Pater noster_, and no more:\r\nhe also was a great builder of St. Thomas Apostle’s parish church, as\r\nappeareth by his arms there, both in stone and glass.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1378, John Filpot, sometime mayor, hired with his own\r\nmoney one thousand soldiers, and defended the realm from incursions\r\nof the enemy, so that in small time his hired men took John Mercer,\r\na sea-rover, with all his ships, which he before had taken from\r\nScarborrow, and fifteen Spanish ships, laden with great riches.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1380, Thomas of Woodstocke, Thomas Percie, Hugh Calverley,\r\nRobert Knoles, and others, being sent with a great power to aid the\r\nduke of Brytaine, the said John Filpot hired ships for them of his\r\nown charges, and released the armour, which the soldiers had pawned\r\nfor their battles, more than a thousand in number. “This most noble\r\ncitizen,” saith Thomas Walsingham, “that had travailed for the commodity\r\nof the whole realm, more than all other of his time, had often relieved\r\nthe king by lending him great sums of money and otherwise, deceased in\r\nA.D. 1384, after that he had assured lands to the city for the relief of\r\nthirteen poor people for ever.”\r\n\r\nIn the year 1381, William Walworth, then mayor, a most provident,\r\nvaliant, and learned citizen, did by his arrest of Wat Tyler (a\r\npresumptuous rebel, upon whom no man durst lay hands), deliver the king\r\nand kingdom from the danger of most wicked traitors, and was for his\r\nservice knighted in the field.\r\n\r\nNicholas Brembar, John Filpot, Robert Laund, Nicholas Twiford, and Adam\r\nFrancis, aldermen, were then for their service likewise knighted; and\r\nSir Robert Knoles, for assisting of the mayor, was made free of this\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nThis Sir Robert Knoles, thus worthily infranchised a citizen, founded a\r\ncollege with an hospital at Pontefract: he also built the great stone\r\nbridge at Rochester, over the river of Medway, etc.\r\n\r\nJohn Churchman, grocer, one of the sheriffs, 1386, for the quiet\r\nof merchants, built a certain house upon Wool wharf, in Tower ward,\r\nto serve for tronage or weighing of wools, and for the customer,\r\ncomptroller, clerks, and other officers to sit, etc.\r\n\r\nAdam Bamme, goldsmith, mayor 1391, in a great dearth, procured corn\r\nfrom parts beyond the seas, to be brought hither in such abundance as\r\nsufficed to serve the city, and the countries near adjoining; to the\r\nfurtherance of which good work he took out of the orphans’ chest in the\r\nGuildhall two thousand marks to buy the said corn, and each alderman\r\nlaid out twenty pounds to the like purpose.\r\n\r\nThomas Knoles, grocer, mayor 1400, with his brethren the aldermen, began\r\nto new build the Guildhall in London, and instead of an old little\r\ncottage in Aldermanberie street, made a fair and goodly house, more\r\nnear unto St. Laurence church in the Jurie: he re-edified St. Anthony’s\r\nchurch, and gave to the grocers his house near unto the same, for relief\r\nof the poor for ever.

He gave besides to the prisons, hospitals, lazar\r\nhouses, and all other poor in the city, or two miles without, very\r\nliberally, and long to be recited.\r\n\r\nSir William Laxton, grocer, mayor 1545, founded a fair free school at\r\nOwndale in Northamptonshire, with six alms houses for the poor.\r\n\r\nSir John Gresham, mercer, mayor 1548, founded a free school at Holt, a\r\nmarket-town in Norfolk.\r\n\r\nSir Rowland Hill, mercer, mayor 1550, caused to be made divers causeways\r\nboth for horse and man; he made four bridges, two of stone, containing\r\neighteen arches in them both; he built one notable free school at\r\nDrayton in Shropshire; he gave to Christ’s hospital in London five\r\nhundred pounds, etc.\r\n\r\nSir Andrew Jud, skinner, mayor 1551, erected one notable free school at\r\nTunbridge in Kent, and alms houses nigh St. Helen’s church in London,\r\nand left to the Skinners lands to the value of sixty pounds three\r\nshillings and eight pence the year; for the which they be bound to pay\r\ntwenty pounds to the schoolmaster, eight pounds to the usher, yearly,\r\nfor ever, and four-shillings the week to the six alms people, and\r\ntwenty-five shillings and four pence the year in coals for ever.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas White, merchant-taylor, mayor 1554, founded St. John’s\r\ncollege, Oxford, and gave great sums of money to divers towns in England\r\nfor relief of the poor, as in my _Summary_.\r\n\r\nEdward Hall, gentleman, of Gray’s inn, a citizen by birth and office, as\r\ncommon sergeant of London, and one of the judges in the Sheriffs’ court;\r\nhe wrote and published a famous and eloquent chronicle, entitled, “The\r\nUniting of the Two noble Families, Lancaster and Yorke.”\r\n\r\nRichard Hils, merchant-taylor, 1560, gave five hundred pounds towards\r\nthe purchase of a house called the manor of the Rose, wherein the\r\nmerchant-taylors founded their free school in London; he also gave\r\nto the said merchant-taylors one plot of ground, with certain small\r\ncottages on the Tower hill, where he built fair alms houses for fourteen\r\nsole women.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time William Lambert, Esq., born in London, a justice\r\nof the peace in Kent, founded a college for the poor which he named of\r\nQueen Elizabeth, in East Greenwich.\r\n\r\nWilliam Harper, merchant-taylor, mayor 1562, founded a free school in\r\nthe town of Bedford, where he was born, and also buried.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Gresham, mercer, 1566, built the Royal Exchange in London,\r\nand by his testament left his dwelling house in Bishopsgate street to\r\nbe a place for readings, allowing large stipends to the readers, and\r\ncertain alms houses for the poor.\r\n\r\nWilliam Patten, gentleman, a citizen by birth, a customer of London\r\noutward, justice of peace in Middlesex, the parish church of\r\nStokenewenton being ruinous, he repaired, or rather new built.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Roo, merchant-taylor, mayor 1568, gave to the\r\nmerchant-taylors lands or tenements, out of them to be given to ten poor\r\nmen, cloth-workers, carpenters, tilers, plasterers, and armourers, forty\r\npounds yearly, namely, four pounds to each, also one hundred pounds to\r\nbe lent to eight poor men; besides he enclosed with a wall of brick\r\nnigh one acre of ground, pertaining to the hospital of Bethlem, to be a\r\nburial for the dead.\r\n\r\nAmbrose Nicholas, salter, mayor 1576, founded twelve alms houses in\r\nMonke’s well street, near unto Creple’s gate, wherein he placed twelve\r\npoor people, having each of them seven pence the week, and once every\r\nyear five sacks of coals, and one quarter of a hundred faggots, all of\r\nhis gift for ever.\r\n\r\nWilliam Lambe, gentleman and clothworker, in the year 1577, built a\r\nwater-conduit at Oldborne cross to his charges of fifteen hundred\r\npounds, and did many other charitable acts, as in my _Summary_.\r\n\r\nSir T. Offley, merchant-taylor, mayor, deceased 1580, appointed by his\r\ntestament the one half of all his goods, and two hundred pounds deducted\r\nout of the other half given to his son Henry, to be given and bestowed\r\nin deeds of charity by his executors, according to his confidence and\r\ntrust in them.\r\n\r\nJohn Haydon, sheriff 1583, gave large legacies, more than three thousand\r\npounds, for the relief of the poor, as in my _Summary_.\r\n\r\nBarnard Randolph, common sergeant of London 1583, gave and delivered\r\nwith his own hand, nine hundred pounds towards the building of\r\nwater-conduits, which was performed. More, by testament he gave one\r\nthousand pounds to be employed in charitable actions; but that money\r\nbeing in hold fast hands, I have not heard how it was bestowed, more\r\nthan of other good men’s testaments--to be performed.\r\n\r\nSir Wolston Dixie, skinner, mayor 1586, founded a free school at\r\nBosworth, and endowed it with twenty pounds land by year.\r\n\r\nRichard May, merchant-taylor, gave three hundred pounds toward the new\r\nbuilding of Blackwell hall in London, a market-place for woollen cloths.\r\n\r\nJohn Fuller, Esq., one of the judges in the sheriffs’ court of London,\r\nby his testament, dated 1592, appointed his wife, her heirs and\r\nassigns, after his decease, to erect one alms house in the parish of\r\nStikoneth,[123] for twelve poor single men, aged fifty years or upwards,\r\nand one other alms house in Shoreditch, for twelve poor aged widow women\r\nof like age, she to endow them with one hundred pounds the year, to\r\nwit, fifty pounds to each for ever, out of his lands in Lincolne shire,\r\nassured ever unto certain fiefs in trust, by a deed of feoffment. Item:\r\nmore, he gave his messuages, lands, and tenements, lying in the parishes\r\nof St. Benet and St. Peter, by Powle’s wharf in London, to feoffees\r\nin trust, yearly for ever, to disburse all the issues and profits of\r\nthe said lands and tenements, to the relieving and discharge of poor\r\nprisoners in the Hole, or two penny wards in the two compters in London,\r\nin equal portions to each compter, so that the prisoners exceed not the\r\nsum of twenty-six shillings and eight pence for every one prisoner at\r\nany one time.\r\n\r\nThus much for famous citizens have I noted their charitable actions,\r\nfor the most part done by them in their lifetime. The residue left in\r\ntrust to their executors, I have known some of them hardly (or never)\r\nperformed; wherefore I wish men to make their own hands their executors,\r\nand their eyes their overseers, not forgetting the old proverb:--\r\n\r\n    “Women be forgetfull, children be unkind,\r\n    Executors be covetous, and take what they find.\r\n    If any body aske where the dead’s goods became,\r\n    They answere, So God me help, and holy dome, he died a poore man.”\r\n\r\nOne worthy citizen merchant-taylor, having many years considered this\r\nproverb foregoing, hath therefore established to twelve poor aged men,\r\nmerchant-taylors, six pounds two shillings to each yearly for ever. He\r\nhath also given them gowns of good broad cloth, lined thoroughly with\r\nbays, and are to receive every three years’ end the like new gowns for\r\never.\r\n\r\nAnd now of some women, citizens’ wives, deserving memory, for example to\r\nposterity shall be noted.\r\n\r\nDame Agnes Foster, widow, sometime wife to Stephen Foster, fishmonger,\r\nmayor 1455, having enlarged the prison of Ludgate in 1463, procured in a\r\ncommon council of this city, certain articles to be established for the\r\nease, comfort, and relief of poor prisoners there, as in the chapter of\r\ngates I have set down.\r\n\r\nAvise Gibson, wife unto Nicholas Gibson, grocer, one of the sheriffs\r\n1539, by license of her husband, founded a free school at Radclyffe,\r\nnear unto London, appointing to the same, for the instruction of sixty\r\npoor men’s children, a schoolmaster and usher with fifty pounds; she\r\nalso built alms houses for fourteen poor aged persons, each of them to\r\nreceive quarterly six shillings and eight pence the piece for ever; the\r\ngovernment of which free school and alms houses she left in confidence\r\nto the Coopers in London. This virtuous gentlewoman was after joined in\r\nmarriage with Sir Anthony Knevet, knight, and so called the Lady Knevet;\r\na fair painted table of her picture was placed in the chapel which she\r\nhad built there, but of late removed thence, by the like reason as the\r\nGrocer’s arms fixed on the outer wall of the schoolhouse are pulled\r\ndown, and the Coopers set in place.[124]\r\n\r\nMargaret Danne, widow to William Danne, ironmonger, one of the sheriffs\r\nof London, gave by her testament to the ironmongers, two thousand\r\npounds, to be lent to young men of that company, paying after the rate\r\nof five pounds in the year for every hundred; which one hundred pounds\r\nso rising yearly, to be employed on charitable actions, as she then\r\nappointed, but not performed in more than thirty years after.\r\n\r\nDame Mary Ramsey, wife to Sir Thomas Ramsey, mayor about the year 1577,\r\nbeing seised of lands in fee simple of her inheritance to the yearly\r\nvalue of two hundred and forty-three pounds, by his consent gave the\r\nsame to Christ’s hospital in London towards the relief of poor children\r\nthere, and other ways, as in my _Summary_ and _Abridgment_ I have\r\nlong since expressed; which gift she in her widowhood confirmed and\r\naugmented, as is showed by monuments in Christ’s hospital erected.\r\n\r\nThus much for the worthiness of citizens in this city, touching whom\r\nJohn Lidgate, a monk of Bury, in the reign of Henry VI., made (amongst\r\nother) these verses following:--\r\n\r\n    “Of seaven things I prayse this citty.\r\n    Of true meaning and faithful observance;\r\n    Of righteousnes, truth, and equity;\r\n    Of stablenes aye kept in legiance;\r\n    And for of vertue thou hast suffisance,\r\n    In this lond here, and other londs all,\r\n    The kinges chamber of custome, men thee call.”\r\n\r\nHaving thus in generality handled the original, the walls, gates,\r\nditches, and fresh waters, the bridges, towers, and castles, the\r\nschools of learning and house of law, the orders and customs, sports\r\nand pastimes, watchings and martial exercises, and lastly the honour\r\nand worthiness of the citizens, I am now to set down the distribution\r\nof this city into parts; and more especially to declare the antiquities\r\nnoteworthy in every of the same; and how both the whole and parts have\r\nbeen from time to time ruled and governed.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[120] “To London in greater quantitie.”--_1st edition_, p. 80.\r\n\r\n[121] “In the yeare 1471, John Stockton, mayor, and eleven aldermen\r\nof London, with the recorder, were all made knightes in the fielde by\r\nEdward IV., for their good service done to him.”--_1st edition_, p. 81.\r\n\r\n[122] Wolverhampton.\r\n\r\n[123] Stepney.\r\n\r\n[124] “Cursed is hee that removeth his neighbors mark, have I\r\nread.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CITY DIVIDED INTO PARTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ancient division of this city was into wards or aldermanries. And\r\ntherefore I will begin at the east, and so proceed through the high and\r\nmost principal street of the city to the west, after this manner.\r\n\r\nFirst, through Aldgate street to the west corner of St. Andrewe’s\r\nchurch, called Undershaft, on the right hand, and Lyme street corner on\r\nthe left; all which is of Aldgate ward; from thence through Cornhill\r\nstreet to the west corner of Leaden hall; all which is of Lyme street\r\nward. From thence, leaving the street that leadeth to Bishopsgate on the\r\nright hand, and the way that leadeth into Grasse street on the left,\r\nstill through Cornhill street, by the conduit to the west corner against\r\nthe Stocks; all which is in Cornhill ward. Then by the said Stocks (a\r\nmarket-place both of fish and flesh standing in the midst of the city)\r\nthrough the Poultry (a street so called) to the great conduit in West\r\nCheape, and so through Cheape to the standard, which is of Cheape ward,\r\nexcept on the south side from Bow-lane to the said standard, which is\r\nof Cordwayner street ward. Then by the standard to the great cross,\r\nwhich is in Cripplegate ward on the north side, and in Bred street ward\r\non the south side. And to the little conduit by Paule’s gate, from\r\nwhence of old time the said high street stretched straight to Ludgate,\r\nall in the ward of Faringdon within, then divided truly from east to\r\nwest, but since by means of the burning of Paule’s church, which was\r\nin the reign of William I., Mauricius, then bishop of London, laid the\r\nfoundation of a new church, so far in largeness exceeding the old, that\r\nthe way towards Ludgate was thereby greatly straitened, as before I have\r\ndiscoursed.\r\n\r\nNow from the north to the south this city was of old time divided, not\r\nby a large highway or street, as from east to west, but by a fair brook\r\nof sweet water, which came from out the north fields through the wall,\r\nand midst of the city, into the river of Thames; which division is\r\ntill this day constantly and without change maintained. This water was\r\ncalled (as I have said) Walbrooke, not Galus brook of a Roman captain\r\nslain by Asclepiodatus, and thrown therein, as some have fabled, but of\r\nrunning through, and from the wall of this city; the course whereof,\r\nto prosecute it particularly, was and is from the said wall to St.\r\nMargaret’s church in Lothberrie; from thence beneath the lower part\r\nof the Grocers’ hall, about the east part of their kitchen, under St.\r\nMildred’s church, somewhat west from the said Stockes’ market; from\r\nthence through Buckles berry, by one great house built of stone and\r\ntimber called the Old Barge, because barges out of the river of Thames\r\nwere rowed up so far into this brook, on the backside of the houses in\r\nWalbrooke street (which street taketh the name of the said brook) by the\r\nwest end of St. John’s church upon Walbrooke, under Horseshew bridge,\r\nby the west side of Tallowchandler’s hall, and of the Skinner’s hall,\r\nand so behind the other houses to Elbow lane, and by a part thereof down\r\nGreenewitch lane, into the river of Thames.\r\n\r\nThis is the course of Walbrooke, which was of old time bridged over in\r\ndivers places, for passage of horses and men, as need required; but\r\nsince, by means of encroachment on the banks thereof, the channel being\r\ngreatly straitened, and other noyances done thereunto, at length the\r\nsame by common consent was arched over with brick, and paved with stone,\r\nequal with the ground, where through it passed, and is now in most\r\nplaces built upon, that no man may by the eye discern it, and therefore\r\nthe trace thereof is hardly known to the common people.\r\n\r\nThis city was divided from east to west, and from north to south. I am\r\nfurther to show how the same was of old time broken into divers parts\r\ncalled wards, whereof Fitzstephen, more than four hundred years since,\r\nwriteth thus:--“This city, (saith he) even as Rome, is divided into\r\nwards; it hath yearly sheriffs instead of consuls. It hath the dignity\r\nof senators in aldermen,” etc. The number of these wards in London\r\nwas, both before and in the reign of Henry III., twenty-four in all;\r\nwhereof thirteen lay on the east side of the said Walbrooke, and eleven\r\non the west. Notwithstanding these eleven grew much more large than\r\nthose of the east; and therefore in the year of Christ 1393, in the\r\n17th of Richard II., Faringdon ward, which was then one entire ward,\r\nbut mightily increased of buildings without the gates, was by act of\r\nparliament appointed to be divided into twain, and to have two aldermen,\r\nto wit, Faringdon within, and Faringdon without, which made up the\r\nnumber of twelve wards on the west side of Walbrooke, and so the whole\r\nnumber of twenty-five on both sides. Moreover, in the year 1550, the\r\nmayor, commonalty, and citizens of London, purchasing the liberties of\r\nthe borough of Southwark, appointed the same to be a ward of London, and\r\nso became the number of thirteen wards on the east, twelve on the west,\r\nand one south of the river Thames, in the said borough of Southwark, in\r\nthe county of Surrey, which in all arise to the number of twenty-six\r\nwards, and twenty-six aldermen of London.\r\n\r\nWards on the east part of Walbrooke are these:--\r\n\r\n    1 Portsoken ward without the walls.\r\n\r\n    2 Tower street ward.\r\n\r\n    3 Ealdegate ward.\r\n\r\n    4 Lime street ward.\r\n\r\n    5 Bishopsgate ward, within the walls and without.\r\n\r\n    6 Brod street ward.\r\n\r\n    7 Cornehil ward.\r\n\r\n    8 Langbourne ward.\r\n\r\n    9 Billingsgate ward.\r\n\r\n    10 Bridge ward within.\r\n\r\n    11 Candlewick street ward.\r\n\r\n    12 Walbrooke ward.\r\n\r\n    13 Downgate ward.\r\n\r\nWards on the west side of Walbrooke are these:\r\n\r\n    14 Vintry ward.\r\n\r\n    15 Cordwainer street ward.\r\n\r\n    16 Cheape ward.\r\n\r\n    17 Colman street warde.\r\n\r\n    18 Basinghall warde.\r\n\r\n    19 Cripplegate ward, within and without.\r\n\r\n    20 Aldersgate ward, within and without.\r\n\r\n    21 Farringdon ward within.\r\n\r\n    22 Bread street ward.\r\n\r\n    23 Queenhithe ward.\r\n\r\n    24 Castle Baynard ward.\r\n\r\n    25 Farringdon ward without the walls.\r\n\r\nOne ward south the river Thames, in the borough of Southwark, by the\r\nname of\r\n\r\n    26 Bridge ward without.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF PORTSOKEN WARD, THE FIRST IN THE EAST PART\r\n\r\n\r\nSeeing that of every of these wards I have to say somewhat, I will begin\r\nwith Portsoken ward without Aldgate.\r\n\r\nThis Portsoken, which soundeth[125] the franchise at the gate, was\r\nsometime a guild, and had beginning in the days of King Edgar, more\r\nthan six hundred years since.[126] There were thirteen knights or\r\nsoldiers, well-beloved to the king and realm, for service by them done,\r\nwhich requested to have a certain portion of land on the east part of\r\nthe city, left desolate and forsaken by the inhabitants, by reason of\r\ntoo much servitude. They besought the king to have this land, with the\r\nliberty of a guild for ever. The king granted to their request, with\r\nconditions following: that is, that each of them should victoriously\r\naccomplish three combats, one above the ground, one under ground,\r\nand the third in the water; and after this, at a certain day in East\r\nSmithfield, they should run with spears against all comers; all which\r\nwas gloriously performed; and the same day the king named it Knighten\r\nGuild, and so bounded it, from Aldgate to the place where the bars now\r\nare, toward the east, on both the sides of the street, and extended\r\nit towards Bishopsgate in the north, unto the house then of William\r\nPresbiter, after of Giffrey Tanner, and then of the heirs of Colver,\r\nafter that of John Easeby, but since of the Lord Bourchier, etc. And\r\nagain towards the south unto the river of Thames, and so far into the\r\nwater, as a horseman, entering the same, may ride at a low water, and\r\nthrow his spear; so that all East Smithfield, with the right part of the\r\nstreet that goeth to Dodding pond into the Thames, and also the hospital\r\nof St. Katherin’s, with the mills that were founded in King Stephen’s\r\ndays, and the outward stone wall, and the new ditch of the Tower, are\r\nof the said fee and liberty; for the said wall and ditch of the Tower\r\nwere made in the time of King Richard, when he was in the Holy Land, by\r\nWilliam Longshampe, Bishop of Ely, as before I have noted unto you.\r\n\r\nThese knights had as then none other charter by all the days of Edgar,\r\nEthelred, and Cnutus, until the time of Edward the Confessor, whom the\r\nheirs of those knights humbly besought to confirm their liberties;\r\nwhereunto he graciously granting,[127] gave them a deed thereof, as\r\nappeareth in the book of the late house of the Holy Trinity. The said\r\ncharter is fair written in the Saxon letter and tongue. After this,\r\nKing William, the son of William the Conqueror, made a confirmation of\r\nthe same liberties, unto the heirs of those knights, in these words:\r\n“William, king of England, to Maurice Bishop, and Godffrey de Magum,\r\nand Richard de Parre, and to his faithfull people of London, greeting:\r\nKnow ye me to have granted to the men of Knighten Guilde, the guilde\r\nthat belonged to them, and the land that belonged thereunto, with all\r\ncustomes, as they had the same in the time of King Edward, and my\r\nfather. Witnesse, Hugh de Buche, at Rething.”\r\n\r\nAfter him, King Henry I. confirmed the same by his charter to the like\r\neffect, the recital whereof I pretermit for brevity. After which time,\r\nthe church of the Holy Trinity, within Aldgate of London, being founded\r\nby Queen Matilda, wife to the said Henry, the multitude of brethren,\r\npraising God day and night therein, in short time so increased, that all\r\nthe city was delighted in the beholding of them; insomuch, that in the\r\nyear 1115, certain burgesses of London, of the progeny of those noble\r\nEnglish knights; to wit, Radulphus Fitalgod, Wilmarde le Deucreshe,\r\nOrgar le Prude, Edward Hupcornehill, Blackstanus, and Alwine his\r\nkinsman, and Robert his brother, the sons of Leafstanus the goldsmith,\r\nWiso his son, Hugh Fitzvulgar, Algare Secusme, coming together into the\r\nchapter-house of the said church of the Holy Trinity, gave to the same\r\nchurch and canons serving God therein, all the lands and soke called in\r\nEnglish Knighten Guilde, which lieth to the wall of the city, without\r\nthe same gate, and stretcheth to the river of Thames; they gave it, I\r\nsay, taking upon them the brotherhood and participation of the benefits\r\nof that house, by the hands of Prior Norman. And the better to confirm\r\nthis their grant, they offered upon the altar there the charter of\r\nEdward, together with the other charters which they had thereof; and\r\nafterward they did put the foresaid prior in seisine thereof, by the\r\nchurch of St. Buttolphe’s, which is built thereon, and is the head\r\nof that land. These things were thus done before Bernard, prior of\r\nDunstable, John, prior of Derland, Geffrey Clinton, chamberlain, and\r\nmany other clerks and laymen, French and English. Orgar le Prude (one\r\nof their company) was sent to King Henry, beseeching him to confirm\r\ntheir gift, which the king gladly granted by his deed: “Henrie, king of\r\nEngland, to Richard Bishop of London, to the shireffes and provost, and\r\nto all his barons and faithfull people, French and English, of London\r\nand Middlesex, greeting: Know ye mee to have graunted and confirmed to\r\nthe church and canons of the Holy Trinitie of London, the soke of the\r\nEnglish Knighten Guilde, and the land which pertaineth thereunto, and\r\nthe church of St. Buttolph, as the men of the same guilde have given and\r\ngranted unto them: and I will and straightly commaund, that they may\r\nhold the same well and honourably and freely, with sacke and soke, toll\r\nand thea, infangthefe, and all customs belonging to it, as the men of\r\nthe same Guild in best sort had the same in the time of K. Edward, and\r\nas King William, my father and brother, did grant it to them by their\r\nwrits. Witnesse, A. the queene, Geffrey the chauncellor, Geoffrey of\r\nClinton, and William of Clinton, at Woodstocke.” All these prescribed\r\nwritings (saith my book), which sometime belonged to the priory of the\r\nHoly Trinity, are registered in the end of the Book of Remembrances,\r\nin the Guildhall of London, marked with the letter C, folio 134. The\r\nking sent also his sheriffs, to wit, Aubrey de Vere, and Roger, nephew\r\nto Hubert, which upon his behalf should invest this church with the\r\npossessions thereof, which the said sheriffs accomplished coming upon\r\nthe ground; Andrew Buchevite, and the forenamed witnesses, and other,\r\nstanding by; notwithstanding, Othowerus Acolivillus, Otto, and Geffrey,\r\nEarl of Essex, constables of the Tower by succession, withheld by force\r\na portion of the said land, as I have before delivered.\r\n\r\nThe prior and canons of the Holy Trinity, being thus seised of the said\r\nland and soke of Knighten Guilde, a part of the suburb without the wall\r\n(but within the liberties of the city), the same prior was, for him and\r\nhis successors, admitted as one of the aldermen of London, to govern\r\nthe same land and soke: according to the customs of the city, he did\r\nsit in court, and rode with the mayor and his brethren the aldermen, as\r\none of them, in scarlet or other livery as they used, until the year\r\n1531, at the which time the said priory, by the last prior there, was\r\nsurrendered to King Henry VIII., in the 23rd of his reign, who gave this\r\npriory to Sir Thomas Audley, knight, lord chancellor of England, and he\r\npulled down the church; since the which dissolution of that house, the\r\nsaid ward of Portsoken hath been governed by a temporal man, one of the\r\naldermen of London, elected by the citizens, as the aldermen of other\r\nwards. Thus much for the out-bounds of Knighten guilde, or Portsoken\r\nward, and for the antiquity and government thereof.\r\n\r\nNow, of the parts therein, this is specially to be noted. First,\r\nthe east part of the Tower standeth there, then an hospital of St.\r\nKatherine’s, founded by Matilda the queen, wife to King Stephen, by\r\nlicense of the priory and convent of the Holy Trinity in London, on\r\nwhose grounds he founded it. Helianor the queen, wife to King Edward\r\nI., a second foundress, appointed there to be a master, three brethren\r\nchaplains, and three sisters, ten poor women, and six poor clerks; she\r\ngave to them the manor of Carlton in Wiltshire, and Upchurch in Kent,\r\netc. Queen Philippa, wife to King Edward III., 1351, founded a chantry\r\nthere, and gave to that hospital ten pounds land by year; it was of late\r\ntime called a free chapel, a college, and an hospital for poor sisters.\r\nThe choir, which of late years was not much inferior to that of Paules,\r\nwas dissolved by Dr. Wilson, a late master there, the brethren and\r\nsisters remaining: this house was valued at £315 14_s._ 2_d._, being\r\nnow of late years inclosed about, or pestered with small tenements and\r\nhomely cottages, having inhabitants, English and strangers, more in\r\nnumber than in some city in England. There lie buried in this church the\r\ncountess of Huntingdon, countess of the March in her time, 1429; John\r\nHolland, Duke of Exeter and Earl of Huntingdon, 1447, and his two wives,\r\nin a fair tomb on the north side the choir; Thomas Walsingham, esquire,\r\nand Thomas Ballarde, esquire, by him, 1465; Thomas Flemming, knight,\r\n1466, etc.[128]\r\n\r\nOn the east and by north of the Tower, lieth East Smithfield and Tower\r\nhill, two plots of ground so called, without the wall of the city; and\r\neast from them both was sometime a monastery, called New Abbey, founded\r\nby King Edward III. in the year 1359, upon occasion as followeth:\r\n\r\nIn the year 1348, the 23rd of Edward III., the first great pestilence\r\nin his time began, and increased so sore, that for want of room in\r\nchurchyards to bury the dead of the city and of the suburbs, one John\r\nCorey, clerk, procured of Nicholas, prior of the Holy Trinity within\r\nAldgate, one toft[129] of ground near unto East Smithfield, for the\r\nburial of them that died, with condition that it might be called the\r\nchurchyard of the Holy Trinity; which ground he caused, by the aid of\r\ndivers devout citizens, to be inclosed with a wall of stone. Robert\r\nElsing, son of William Elsing, gave five pounds thereunto; and the same\r\nwas dedicated by Ralph Stratford, Bishop of London, where innumerable\r\nbodies of the dead were afterwards buried, and a chapel built in the\r\nsame place to the honour of God: to the which King Edward setting his\r\neye (having before, in a tempest on the sea, and peril of drowning,\r\nmade a vow to build a monastery to the honour of God, and our lady of\r\ngrace, if God would grant him grace to come safe to land), built there\r\na monastery, placing an abbot, and monks of the Cistercian, or White\r\norder. The bounds of this plot of ground, together with a decree for\r\ntithes thereof, are expressed in the charter, the effect whereof I\r\nhave set down in another place, and have to show. This house, at the\r\nlate general suppression, was valued at £546 0_s._ 10_d._ yearly; it\r\nwas surrendered in the year 1539, the 30th of Henry VIII.; since the\r\nwhich time, the said monastery being clean pulled down by Sir Arthur\r\nDarcie, knight, and others, of late time in place thereof is built a\r\nlarge storehouse for victuals; and convenient ovens are built there, for\r\nbaking of biscuits to serve her majesty’s ships. The grounds adjoining,\r\nbelonging to the said abbey, are employed in building of small tenements.\r\n\r\nFor Tower hill, as the same is greatly diminished by building of\r\ntenements and garden-plots, etc. So it is of late, to wit, in the year\r\nof Christ 1593, on the north side thereof, and at the west end of Hog\r\nstreet, beautified by certain fair alms houses, strongly built of brick\r\nand timber, and covered with slate for the poor, by the merchant-tailors\r\nof London, in place of some small cottages given to them by Richard\r\nHils, sometime a master of that company, one thousand loads of timber\r\nfor that use, being also given by Anthonie Radcliffe, of the same\r\nsociety, alderman. In these alms houses, fourteen charitable brethren\r\nof the said merchant-tailors yet living, have placed fourteen poor\r\nsole women, which receive each of them of their founder sixteen pence,\r\nor better, weekly, besides £8 15_s._ yearly, paid out of the common\r\ntreasury of the same corporation for fuel.\r\n\r\nFrom the west part of this Tower hill, towards Aldgate, being a long\r\ncontinual street, amongst other smaller buildings in that row, there\r\nwas sometime an abbey of nuns of the order of St. Clare, called the\r\nMinories, founded by Edmond, Earl of Lancaster, Leycester, and Darbie,\r\nbrother to King Edward III., in the year 1293; the length of which abbey\r\ncontained fifteen perches and seven feet, near unto the king’s street or\r\nhighway, etc., as appeareth by a deed, dated 1303.\r\n\r\nA plague of pestilence being in this city, in the year 1515, there died\r\nin this house of nuns professed to the number of twenty-seven, besides\r\nother lay people, servants in their house. This house was valued to\r\ndispend £418 8_s._ 5_d._ yearly, and was surrendered by Dame Elizabeth\r\nSalvage, the last abbess there, unto King Henry VIII. in the 30th of his\r\nreign, the year of Christ 1539.\r\n\r\nIn place of this house of nuns is now built divers fair and large\r\nstorehouses for armour and habiliments of war, with divers workhouses,\r\nserving to the same purpose: there is a small parish church for\r\ninhabitants of the close, called St. Trinities.\r\n\r\nNear adjoining to this abbey, on the south side thereof, was sometime\r\na farm belonging to the said nunnery; at the which farm I myself in my\r\nyouth have fetched many a halfpenny worth of milk, and never had less\r\nthan three ale pints for a halfpenny in the summer, nor less than one\r\nale quart for a halfpenny in the winter, always hot from the kine, as\r\nthe same was milked and strained. One Trolop, and afterwards Goodman,\r\nwere the farmers there, and had thirty or forty kine to the pail.\r\nGoodman’s son being heir to his father’s purchase, let out the ground\r\nfirst for grazing of horses, and then for garden-plots, and lived like a\r\ngentleman thereby.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of that street lieth the ditch without the walls of\r\nthe city, which of old time was used to be open, always from time to\r\ntime cleansed from filth and mud, as need required; of great breadth,\r\nand so deep, that divers, watering horses where they thought it\r\nshallowest, were drowned, both horse and man. But now of later time the\r\nsame ditch is inclosed, and the banks thereof let out for garden-plots,\r\ncarpenters’ yards, bowling allies, and divers houses thereon built,\r\nwhereby the city wall is hidden, the ditch filled up, a small channel\r\nleft, and that very shallow.\r\n\r\nFrom Aldgate, east, lieth a large street and highway, sometime\r\nreplenished with few, but fair and comely buildings; on the north side\r\nwhereof, the first was the parish church of St. Buttolph, in a large\r\ncemetery or churchyard. This church hath been lately new built at the\r\nspecial charges of the priors of the Holy Trinity; patrons thereof, as\r\nit appeareth by the arms of that house, engraven on the stone work.\r\nThe parishioners of this parish being of late years mightily increased,\r\nthe church is pestered with lofts and seats for them. Monuments in this\r\nchurch are few: Henry Jorden founded a chauntry there; John Romany\r\nOllarie, and Agnes his wife, were buried there about 1408; Richard\r\nChester, alderman, one of the sheriffs, 1484; Thomas Lord Darcie of\r\nthe north, knight of the garter, beheaded 1537; Sir Nicholas Carew, of\r\nBedington, in Surrey, knight of the garter, beheaded 1538; Sir Arthur\r\nDarcie, youngest son to Thomas Lord Darcie, deceased at the new abbey on\r\nthe Tower hill, was buried there. East from this parish church, there\r\nwere certain fair inns for receipt of travellers repairing to the city,\r\nup towards Hog lane end, somewhat within the bars, a mark showing how\r\nfar the liberties of the city do extend.\r\n\r\nThis Hog lane stretcheth north toward St. Mary Spitle without\r\nBishopsgate, and within these forty years[130] had on both sides fair\r\nhedge rows of elm trees, with bridges and easy stiles to pass over into\r\nthe pleasant fields, very commodious for citizens therein to walk,\r\nshoot, and otherwise to recreate and refresh their dull spirits in\r\nthe sweet and wholesome air, which is now within a few years made a\r\ncontinual building throughout, of garden-houses and small cottages; and\r\nthe fields on either sides be turned into garden-plots, tenter yards,\r\nbowling alleys, and such like, from Houndes ditch in the west, as far as\r\nWhite Chappell, and further towards the east.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of the highway from Aldgate were some few tenements,\r\nthinly scattered here and there, with many void spaces between them,\r\nup to the Bars; but now that street is not only fully replenished with\r\nbuildings outward, and also pestered with divers alleys, on either side\r\nto the bars, but to White Chappell and beyond. Among the which late\r\nbuildings, one memorable for the commodity of that east part of this\r\ncity is a fair water conduit, hard without the gate; at the building\r\nwhereof in the year 1535, Sir John Allen being mayor, two-fifteens were\r\ngranted by the citizens for the making and laying of pipes, to convey\r\nwater from Hackney to that place; and so that work was finished.\r\n\r\nFrom Aldgate, north-west to Bishopsgate, lieth the ditch of the city\r\ncalled Houndes ditch; for that in old time, when the same lay open, much\r\nfilth (conveyed forth of the city), especially dead dogs, were there\r\nlaid or cast; wherefore of latter time a mud wall was made, inclosing\r\nthe ditch, to keep out the laying of such filth as had been accustomed.\r\nOver against this mud wall, on the other side of the street, was a fair\r\nfield, sometime belonging to the priory of the Trinity, and since by Sir\r\nThomas Audley given to Magdalen college in Cambridge: this field (as all\r\nother about the city) was inclosed, reserving open passage thereinto,\r\nfor such as were disposed. Towards the street were some small cottages,\r\nof two stories high, and little garden-plots backward, for poor bed-rid\r\npeople, for in that street dwelt none other, built by some prior of the\r\nHoly Trinity, to whom that ground belonged.\r\n\r\nIn my youth, I remember, devout people, as well men as women of this\r\ncity, were accustomed oftentimes, especially on Fridays, weekly to walk\r\nthat way purposely there to bestow their charitable alms; every poor man\r\nor woman lying in their bed within their window, which was towards the\r\nstreet, open so low that every man might see them, a clean linen cloth\r\nlying in their window, and a pair of beads, to show that there lay a\r\nbed-rid body, unable but to pray only. This street was first paved in\r\nthe year 1503.\r\n\r\nAbout the latter reign of Henry VIII., three brethren that were\r\ngunfounders, surnamed Owens, got ground there to build upon, and to\r\ninclose for casting of brass ordinance. These occupied a good part of\r\nthe street on the field side, and in a short time divers others also\r\nbuilt there, so that the poor bed-rid people were worn out, and, in\r\nplace of their homely cottages, such houses built as do rather want\r\nroom than rent; which houses be for the most part possessed by brokers,\r\nsellers of old apparel, and such like. The residue of the field was for\r\nthe most part made into a garden by a gardener named Cawsway, one that\r\nserved the markets with herbs and roots; and in the last year of King\r\nEdward VI. the same was parcelled into gardens wherein are now many fair\r\nhouses of pleasure built.\r\n\r\nOn the ditch side of this street the mud wall is also by little and\r\nlittle all taken down, the bank of the ditch being raised, made level\r\nground, and turned into garden-plots and carpenters’ yards, and many\r\nlarge houses are there built; the filth of which houses, as also the\r\nearth cast out of their vaults, is turned into the ditch, by which means\r\nthe ditch is filled up, and both the ditch and wall so hidden that they\r\ncannot be seen of the passers by. This Portsoken ward hath an alderman\r\nand his deputy, common councillors six, constables four, scavengers\r\nfour, for the wardemote inquest eighteen, and a beadle. To the fifteen\r\nit is cessed at four pounds ten shillings.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[125] “As much as”--_1st edition_, p. 85.\r\n\r\n[126] Liber Trinitat.\r\n\r\n[127] Liber Trinitat.\r\n\r\n[128] The further history of this establishment will be found in\r\nNichols’ _History of the Hospital and Collegiate Church of St.\r\nKatherine, near the Tower of London_.\r\n\r\n[129] The Danish _toft_, Swedish _tomt_, properly signifies the ground\r\nupon which a house stands.

One half of\r\nthe Tower, the ditch on the west side, and bulwarks adjoining, do stand\r\nwithin that part where the wall of the city of old time went straight\r\nfrom the postern gate south to the river of Thames, before that the\r\nTower was built. From and without the Tower ditch, west and by north,\r\nis the said Tower hill, sometime a large plot of ground, now greatly\r\nstraitened by incroachments (unlawfully made and suffered) for gardens\r\nand houses; some on the bank of the Tower ditch, whereby the Tower ditch\r\nis marred, but more near unto the wall of the city from the postern\r\nnorth, till over against the principal fore-gate of the Lord Lumley’s\r\nhouse, etc.; but the Tower ward goeth no further that way.\r\n\r\nUpon this hill is always readily prepared, at the charges of the city, a\r\nlarge scaffold and gallows of timber, for the execution of such traitors\r\nor transgressors as are delivered out of the Tower, or otherwise, to the\r\nsheriffs of London by writ, there to be executed. I read, that in the\r\nfifth of King Edward IV.[131] a scaffold and gallows was there set up\r\nby other the king’s officers, and not of the city’s charges, whereupon\r\nthe mayor and his brethren complained, but were answered by the king\r\nthat the Tower hill was of the liberty of the city; and whatsoever was\r\ndone in that point was not in derogation of the city’s liberties, and\r\ntherefore commanded proclamation[132] to be made, as well within the\r\ncity as in the suburbs, as followeth: “Forasmuch as, the seventh day of\r\nthis present month of November, gallows were erect and set up besides\r\nour Tower of London, within the liberties and franchises of our city of\r\nLondon, in derogation and prejudice of the liberties and franchises of\r\nthis city, the king our sovereign lord would it be certainly understood\r\nthat the erection and setting up of the said gallows was not done by\r\nhis commandment; wherefore the king our sovereign lord willeth that the\r\nerection and setting up the said gallows be not any precedent or example\r\nthereby hereafter to be taken, in hurt, prejudice, or derogation of the\r\nfranchises, liberties, and privileges of the said city, which he at all\r\ntimes hath had, and hath in his benevolence, tender favour, and good\r\ngrace, etc. Apud Westminst. 9 die Novemb. anno regni nostri quinto.”\r\nOn the north side of this hill is the said Lord Lumley’s house, and on\r\nthe west side divers houses lately built, and other incroachments along\r\nsouth to Chick lane,[133] on the east of Barking church, at the end\r\nwhereof you have Tower street stretching from the Tower hill, west to\r\nSt. Margaret Patten’s church parsonage.\r\n\r\nNow therefore, to begin at the east end of the street, on the north side\r\nthereof, is the fair parish church called Allhallows Barking, which\r\nstandeth in a large, but sometime far larger, cemetery or churchyard; on\r\nthe north side whereof was sometime built a fair chapel, founded by King\r\nRichard I.; some have written that his heart was buried there under the\r\nhigh altar. This chapel was confirmed and augmented by King Edward I.\r\nEdward IV. gave license to his cousin John, Earl of Worcester, to found\r\nthere a brotherhood for a master and brethren; and he gave to the custos\r\nof that fraternity, which was Sir John Scot, knight, Thomas Colte,\r\nJohn Tate, and John Croke, the priory of Totingbecke, and advowson\r\nof the parish church of Streatham, in the county of Surrey, with all\r\nthe members and appurtenances, and a part of the priory of Okeborn in\r\nWiltshire, both priors aliens, and appointed it to be called the king’s\r\nchapel or chantry, _In capella Beatæ Mariæ de Barking_. King Richard\r\nIII. new built and founded therein a college of priests, etc. Hamond de\r\nLega was buried in that chapel. Robert Tate, mayor of London, 1488,[134]\r\nand other, were there buried. This chapel and college were suppressed\r\nand pulled down in the year 1548, the 2nd of King Edward VI. The ground\r\nwas employed as a garden-plot during the reigns of King Edward, Queen\r\nMary, and part of Queen Elizabeth, till at length a large strong frame\r\nof timber and brick was set thereon, and employed as a store-house of\r\nmerchants’ goods brought from the sea by Sir William Winter, etc.\r\n\r\nMonuments in the parish church of Allhallows Barking, not defaced, are\r\nthese:--Sir Thomas Studinham, of Norwich diocess, knight, 1469; Thomas\r\nGilbart, draper and merchant of the staple, 1483; John Bolt, merchant\r\nof the staple, 1459; Sir John Stile, knight, draper, 1500. William\r\nThinne, esq., one of the clerks of the Green cloth, and master of the\r\nhousehold to King Henry VIII., 1546; Humfrey Monmouth, draper, one of\r\nthe sheriffs, 1535; Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, beheaded 1546; Sir\r\nRichard Devereux, son and heir to the Lord Ferrers of Chartley; Richard\r\nBrowne, esq. 1546; Philip Dennis, esq. 1556; Andrew Evenger, salter;\r\nWilliam Robinson, mercer, alderman, 1552; William Armorer, cloth-worker,\r\nesquire, governor of the pages of honour, or master of the heance men,\r\nservant to Henry VIII., Edward VI., and Queen Mary, buried 1560. Besides\r\nwhich there be divers tombs without inscription. John Crolys and Thomas\r\nPike, citizens of London, founded a chantry there 1388.\r\n\r\nBy the west end of this parish church and chapel, lieth Sidon lane,\r\nnow corruptly called Sything lane, from Tower street up north to\r\nHart street. In this Sidon lane divers fair and large houses are\r\nbuilt, namely, one by Sir John Allen, sometime mayor of London, and\r\nof council unto King Henry VIII.; Sir Francis Walsingham, knight,\r\nprincipal secretary to the queen’s majesty that now is, was lodged\r\nthere, and so was the Earl of Essex, etc. At the north-west corner of\r\nthis lane standeth a proper parish church of St. Olave, which church,\r\ntogether with some houses adjoining, as also others over against it\r\nin Hart street, are of the said Tower street ward. Monuments in this\r\nparish church of St. Olave be these:--Richard Cely and Robert Cely,\r\nfellmongers, principal builders and benefactors of this church; Dame\r\nJohan, wife to Sir John Zouch, 1439; John Clarenciaulx, king of arms,\r\n1427; Thomas Sawle; Sir Richard Haddon, mercer, mayor 1512; Thomas\r\nBurnell, mercer, 1548; Thomas Morley, gentleman, 1566; Sir John\r\nRadcliffe, knight, 1568; and Dame Anne his wife, 1585; Chapone, a\r\nFlorentine gentleman, 1582; Sir Hamond Vaughan, knight; George Stoddard,\r\nmerchant; etc.\r\n\r\nThen have ye out of Tower street, also on the north side, one other\r\nlane, called Marte lane, which runneth up towards the north, and is\r\nfor the most part of this Tower street ward; which lane is about the\r\nthird quarter thereof divided from Aldgate ward, by a chain to be drawn\r\nathwart the said lane, above the west end of Hart street. Cokedon hall,\r\nsometime at the south-west end of Marte lane, I read of.[135]\r\n\r\nA third lane out of Tower street, on the north side, is called Mincheon\r\nlane, so called of tenements there sometime pertaining to the Minchuns\r\nor nuns of St. Helen’s in Bishopsgate street. This lane is all of the\r\nsaid ward, except the corner house towards Fenchurch street. In this\r\nlane of old time dwelt divers strangers born of Genoa and those parts;\r\nthese were commonly called galley men, as men that came up in the\r\ngalleys brought up wines and other merchandises, which they landed in\r\nThames street, at a place called Galley key; they had a certain coin\r\nof silver amongst themselves, which were halfpence of Genoa, and were\r\ncalled Galley halfpence; these halfpence were forbidden in the 13th of\r\nHenry IV., and again by parliament in the 4th of Henry V. It was, that\r\nif any person bring into this realm halfpence, suskinges, or dodkins, he\r\nshould be punished as a thief; and he that taketh or payeth such money\r\nshall leese a hundred shillings, whereof the king shall have the one\r\nhalf, and he that will sue the other half. Notwithstanding, in my youth,\r\nI have seen them pass current, but with some difficulty, for that the\r\nEnglish halfpence were then, though not so broad, somewhat thicker and\r\nstronger.\r\n\r\nThe Clothworkers’ hall is in this lane. Then at the west end of Tower\r\nstreet have ye a little turning towards the north to a fair house\r\nsometime belonging to one named Griste, for he dwelt there in the year\r\n1449. And Jack Cade, captain of the rebels in Kent, being by him in this\r\nhis house feasted, when he had dined, like an unkind guest, robbed him\r\nof all that was there to be found worth the carriage. Next to this is\r\none other fair house, sometime built by Angell Dune, grocer, alderman of\r\nLondon, since possessed by Sir John Champneis, alderman, and mayor of\r\nLondon. He built in this house a high tower of brick, the first that I\r\never heard of in any private man’s house, to overlook his neighbours in\r\nthis city. But this delight of his eye was punished with blindness some\r\nyears before his death. Since that time. Sir Percevall Hart, a jolly\r\ncourtier, and knight-harbinger to the queen, was lodged there, etc.\r\nFrom this house, somewhat west, is the parish church of St. Margaret’s\r\nPattens; to the which church and house, on the north side, and as far\r\nover against on the south, stretcheth the farthest west part of this\r\nward.\r\n\r\nAnd, therefore, to begin again at the east end of Tower street, on\r\nthe south side, have ye Beare lane, wherein are many fair houses, and\r\nrunneth down to Thames street. The next is Sporiar lane, of old time\r\nso called, but since and of later time named Water lane, because it\r\nrunneth down to the water gate by the Custom house in Thames street.\r\nThen is there Hart lane for Harpe lane, which likewise runneth down\r\ninto Thames street. In this Hart lane is the Bakers’ hall, sometime the\r\ndwelling-house of John Chichley, chamberlain of London, who was son\r\nto William Chichley, alderman of London, brother to William Chichley,\r\narchdeacon of Canterburie, nephew to Robert Chichley, mayor of London,\r\nand to Henry Chichley, archbishop of Canterburie. This John Chichley,\r\nsaith John Leland, had twenty-four children. Sir Thomas Kirrioll, of\r\nKent, after he had been long prisoner in France, married Elizabeth, one\r\nof the daughters of this Chichley, by whom he had this Chichley’s house.\r\nThis Elizabeth was secondly married to Sir Ralfe Ashton, knight-marshal,\r\nand thirdly, to Sir John Burchier, uncle to the late Burchier, Earl of\r\nEssex, but she never had child. Edward Poynings made part with Burchier\r\nand Elizabeth, to have Ostenhanger in Kent, after their death, and\r\nentered into it, they living.\r\n\r\nIn Tower street, between Hart lane and Church lane, was a quadrant\r\ncalled Galley row, because galley men dwelt there. Then have ye two\r\nlanes out of Tower street, both called Church lanes, because one runneth\r\ndown by the east end of St. Dunstan’s church, and the other by the west\r\nend of the same; out of the west lane turneth another lane west towards\r\nSt. Marie Hill, and is called Fowle lane, which is for the most part in\r\nTower street ward.\r\n\r\nThis church of St. Dunstone is called, in the east, for difference from\r\none other of the same name in the west; it is a fair and large church\r\nof an ancient building, and within a large churchyard; it hath a great\r\nparish of many rich merchants, and other occupiers of divers trades,\r\nnamely salters and ironmongers.\r\n\r\nThe monuments in that church be these:--In the choir, John Kenington,\r\nparson, there buried 1374; William Islip, parson, 1382; John Kryoll,\r\nesq., brother to Thomas Kryoll, 1400; Nicholas Bond, Thomas Barry,\r\nmerchant, 1445; Robert Shelly, esq., 1420; Robert Pepper, grocer, 1445;\r\nJohn Norwich, grocer, 1390; Alice Brome, wife to John Coventry, sometime\r\nmayor of London, 1433; William Isaack, draper, alderman, 1508; Edward\r\nSkales, merchant, 1521; John Ricroft, esq., sergeant of the larder to\r\nHenry VII. and Henry VIII., 1532; Edwaters, esq., sergeant-at-arms,\r\n1558; Sir Bartholomew James, draper, mayor 1479, buried under a fair\r\nmonument with his lady; Ralfe Greenway, grocer, alderman, put under the\r\nstone of Robert Pepper, 1559; Thomas Bledlow, one of the sheriffs 1472;\r\nJames Bacon, fishmonger, sheriff, 1573; Sir Richard Champion, draper,\r\nmayor 1568; Henry Herdson, skinner, alderman, 1555; Sir James Garnado,\r\nknight; William Hariot, draper, mayor 1481, buried in a fair chapel by\r\nhim built, 1517; John Tate, son to Sir John Tate, in the same chapel in\r\nthe north wall; Sir Christopher Draper, ironmonger, mayor 1566, buried\r\n1580. And many other worshipful personages besides, whose monuments are\r\naltogether defaced.\r\n\r\nNow for the two Church lanes, they meeting on the south side of this\r\nchurch and church yard, do join in one, and running down to the Thames\r\nstreet, the same is called St. Dunstan’s hill, at the lower end whereof\r\nthe said Thames street towards the west on both sides almost to Belin’s\r\ngate, but towards the east up to the water gate, by the bulwark of the\r\nTower, is all of Tower street ward. In this street, on the Thames side,\r\nare divers large landing-places called wharfs or keys, for craneage up\r\nof wares and merchandise, as also for shipping of wares from thence to\r\nbe transported. These wharfs and keys commonly bear the names of their\r\nowners, and are therefore changeable. I read, in the 26th of Henry VI.,\r\nthat in the parish of St. Dunstone in the east, a tenement, called\r\nPasseke’s wharf, and another called Horner’s key, in Thames street,\r\nwere granted to William Harindon, esq. I read also, that in the 6th of\r\nRichard II., John Churchman, grocer, for the quiet of merchants, did\r\nnewly build a certain house upon the key, called Wool wharf, in the\r\nTower street ward, in the parish of Allhallows Barking, betwixt the\r\ntenement of Paule Salisberrie on the east part, and the lane called the\r\nwater gate on the west, to serve for tronage, or weighing of wools in\r\nthe port of London; whereupon the king granted that during the life of\r\nthe said John, the aforesaid tronage should be held and kept in the said\r\nhouse, with easements there for the balances and weights, and a counting\r\nplace for the customer, controllers, clerks, and other officers of the\r\nsaid tronage, together with ingress and egress to and from the same,\r\neven as was had in other places, where the said tronage was wont to be\r\nkept, and that the king should pay yearly to the said John during his\r\nlife forty shillings at the terms of St. Michael and Easter, by even\r\nportions, by the hands of his customer, without any other payment to the\r\nsaid John, as in the indenture thereof more at large appeareth.\r\n\r\nNear unto this Customer’s key towards the east, is the said water gate,\r\nand west from it Porter’s key, then Galley key, where the gallies were\r\nused to unlade and land their merchandises and wares; and that part of\r\nThames street was therefore of some called Galley row, but more commonly\r\nPetty Wales.\r\n\r\nOn the north side, as well as on the south of this Thames street, are\r\nmany fair houses large for stowage, built for merchants; but towards\r\nthe east end thereof, namely, over against Galley key, Wool key, and the\r\nCustom house, there have been of old time some large buildings of stone,\r\nthe ruins whereof do yet remain, but the first builders and owners of\r\nthem are worn out of memory, wherefore the common people affirm Julius\r\nCæsar to be the builder thereof, as also of the Tower itself. But\r\nthereof I have spoken already. Some are of another opinion, and that a\r\nmore likely, that this great stone building was sometime the lodging\r\nappointed for the princes of Wales, when they repaired to this city, and\r\nthat, therefore, the street in that part is called Petty Wales, which\r\nname remaineth there most commonly until this day, even as where the\r\nkings of Scotland were used to be lodged betwixt Charing cross and White\r\nhall, it is likewise called Scotland, and where the earls of Britons\r\nwere lodged without Aldersgate, the street is called Britain street, etc.\r\n\r\nThe said building might of old time pertain to the princes of Wales, as\r\nis aforesaid, but is since turned to other use.\r\n\r\nIt is before noted of Galley key, that the galleys of Italie, and\r\nother parts, did there discharge their wines and merchandises brought\r\nto this city. It is like, therefore, that the merchants and owners\r\nprocured the place to build upon for their lodgings and storehouses, as\r\nthe merchants of the Haunce of Almaine were licensed to have a house,\r\ncalled _Gilda Teutonicorum_, the Guild hall of the Germans. Also the\r\nmerchants of Burdeaux were licensed to build at the Vintry, strongly\r\nwith stone, as may be yet seen, and seemeth old, though often repaired;\r\nmuch more cause have these buildings in Petty Wales, though as lately\r\nbuilt, and partly of the like stone brought from Caen in Normandie, to\r\nseem old, which for many years, to wit, since the galleys left their\r\ncourse of landing there,[136] hath fallen to ruin, and been let out for\r\nstabling of horses, to tipplers of beer, and such like; amongst others,\r\none Mother Mampudding (as they termed her) for many years kept this\r\nhouse, or a great part thereof, for victualling; and it seemeth that\r\nthe builders of the hall of this house were shipwrights, and not house\r\ncarpenters; for the frame thereof (being but low) is raised of certain\r\nprincipal posts of main timber, fixed deep in the ground, without any\r\ngroundsell, boarded close round about on the inside, having none other\r\nwall from the ground to the roof, those boards not exceeding the length\r\nof a clap board, about an inch thick, every board ledging over other as\r\nin a ship or galley, nailed with ship nails called rough and clench,\r\nto wit, rough nails with broad round heads, and clenched on the other\r\nside with square plates of iron. The roof of this hall is also wrought\r\nof the like board, and nailed with rough and clench, and seemeth as it\r\nwere a galley, the keel turned upwards; and I observed that no worm or\r\nrottenness is seen to have entered either board or timber of that hall,\r\nand therefore, in mine opinion, of no great antiquity.[137]\r\n\r\nI read, in 44th of Edward III., that a hospital in the parish of Barking\r\nchurch was founded by Robert Denton, chaplain, for the sustentation\r\nof poor priests, and other both men and women, that were sick of the\r\nfrenzy, there to remain till they were perfectly whole, and restored\r\nto good memory. Also I read, that in the 6th of Henry V. there was in\r\nthe Tower ward a messuage, or great house, called Cobham’s inn; and in\r\nthe 37th of Henry VI, a messuage in Thames street pertaining to Richard\r\nLongvile, etc. Some of the ruins before spoken of may seem to be of the\r\nforesaid hospital, belonging peradventure to some prior alien, and so\r\nsuppressed among the rest in the reign of Edward III. or Henry V., who\r\nsuppressed them all. Thus much for the bounds and antiquities of this\r\nward, wherein is noted the Tower of London, three parish churches, the\r\ncustom house, and two halls of companies, to wit, the clothworkers and\r\nthe bakers. This ward hath an alderman, his deputy, common councillors\r\neight, constables thirteen, scavengers twelve, wardmote men thirteen,\r\nand a beadle; it is taxed to the fifteenth at six and twenty pounds.[138]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[131] Liber l. folio 40.\r\n\r\n[132] Proclamation.

The principal street of this ward\r\nbeginneth at Aldgate, stretching west to sometime a fair well, where\r\nnow a pump is placed; from thence the way being divided into twain, the\r\nfirst and principal street is called Aldgate street, runneth on the\r\nsouth side to Lime street corner, and half that street down on the left\r\nhand is also of that ward. In the mid way on that south side, betwixt\r\nAldgate and Lime street, is Hart horn alley, a way that goeth through\r\ninto Fenchurch street over against Northumberland house. Then have ye\r\nthe Bricklayers’ hall, and another alley called Sprinckle alley, now\r\nnamed Sugarloafe alley, of the like sign. Then is there a fair house,\r\nwith divers tenements near adjoining, sometimes belonging to a late\r\ndissolved priory, since possessed by Mistress Cornewallies, widow, and\r\nher heirs, by gift of Henry VIII., in reward of fine puddings (as it\r\nwas commonly said) by her made, wherewith she had presented him. Such\r\nwas the princely liberality of those times. Of later time Sir Nicholas\r\nThrogmorton, knight, was lodged there. Then, somewhat more west is\r\nBelzettar’s lane, so called of the first builder and owner thereof, now\r\ncorruptly called Billitar lane. Betwixt this Belzettar lane and Lime\r\nstreet was of later time a frame of three fair houses, set up in the\r\nyear 1590, in place where before was a large garden plot, enclosed from\r\nthe high street with a brick wall, which wall being taken down, and the\r\nground dug deep for cellarage, there was found right under the said\r\nbrick wall another wall of stone, with a gate arched of stone, and gates\r\nof timber to be closed in the midst towards the street; the timber of\r\nthe gates was consumed, but the hinges of iron still remained on their\r\nstaples on both the sides. Moreover, in that wall were square windows,\r\nwith bars of iron on either side of the gate. This wall was under ground\r\nabout two fathoms deep, as I then esteemed it, and seemeth to be the\r\nruins of some houses burned in the reign of King Stephen, when the fire\r\nbegan in the house of one Alewarde, near London stone, and consumed east\r\nto Aldgate, whereby it appeareth how greatly the ground of this city\r\nhath been in that place raised.\r\n\r\nOn the north side this principal street stretcheth to the west corner of\r\nSt. Andrewe’s church, and then the ward turneth towards the north by St.\r\nMarie street, on the east side to St. Augustine’s church in the wall,\r\nand so by Buries markes again, or about by the wall to Aldgate.\r\n\r\nThe second way from Aldgate, more towards the south, from the pump\r\naforesaid, is called Fenchurch street, and is of Aldgate ward till\r\nye come to Culver alley, on the west side of Ironmongers hall, where\r\nsometime was a lane which went out of Fenchurch street to the middest of\r\nLime street, but this lane was stopped up for suspicion of thieves that\r\nlurked there by night. Again to Aldgate out of the principal street,\r\neven by the gate and wall of the city, runneth a lane south to Crowched\r\nFriers, and then Woodroffe lane to the Tower hill, and out of this lane\r\nwest a street called Hart street, which of that ward stretched to Sydon\r\nlane by St. Olave’s church. One other lane more west from Aldgate goeth\r\nby Northumberland house toward the Crossed Friers; then have ye on the\r\nsame side the north end of Mart lane and Blanch Apleton, where that ward\r\nendeth.\r\n\r\nThus much for the bounds; now for monuments, or places most ancient and\r\nnotable.\r\n\r\nI am first to begin with the late dissolved priory of the Holy Trinity,\r\ncalled Christ’s church, on the right hand within Aldgate. This priory\r\nwas founded by Matilda, queen, wife to Henry I., in the same place where\r\nSiredus sometime began to erect a church in honour of the Cross and of\r\nSt. Marie Magdalen, of which the Dean and Chapter of Waltham were wont\r\nto receive thirty shillings. The queen was to acquit her church thereof,\r\nand in exchange gave unto them a mill. King Henry confirmed her gift.\r\nThis church was given to Norman, first canon regular in all England.\r\nThe said queen also gave unto the same church, and those that served\r\nGod therein, the plot of Aldgate, and the soke thereunto belonging,\r\nwith all customs so free as she had held the same, and twenty-five\r\npound blankes, which she had of the city of Excester, as appeareth by\r\nher deed, wherein she nameth the house Christ’s church, and reporteth\r\nAldgate to be of her domains, which she granteth with two parts of\r\nthe rent of the city of Excester. Norman took upon him to be prior of\r\nChrist’s church, in the year of Christ 1108, in the parishes of St. Mary\r\nMagdalen, St. Michael, St. Katherine, and the Blessed Trinity, which\r\nnow was made but one parish of the Holy Trinity, and was in old time of\r\nthe Holy Cross or Holy Rood parish. The priory was built on a piece of\r\nground in the parish of St. Katherine towards Aldgate, which lieth in\r\nlength betwixt the King’s street, by the which men go towards Aldgate,\r\nnear to the chapel of St. Michael towards the north, and containeth in\r\nlength eighty-three ells, half, quarter, and half-quarter of the king’s\r\niron eln, and lieth in breadth, etc. The soke and ward of Aldgate was\r\nthen bounded as I have before showed. The queen was a means also that\r\nthe land and English Knighten Guild was given unto the prior Norman:\r\nthe honourable man, Geffrey de Glinton, was a great helper therein, and\r\nobtained that the canons might enclose the way betwixt their church\r\nand the wall of the city, etc. This priory, in process of time, became\r\na very fair and large church, rich in lands and ornaments, and passed\r\nall the priories in the city of London or shire of Middlesex; the prior\r\nwhereof was an alderman of London, to wit, of Portsoken ward.\r\n\r\nI read, that Eustacius, the eighth prior, about the year 1264, because\r\nhe would not deal with temporal matters, instituted Theobald Fitz\r\nIvonis, alderman of Portsoken ward under him, and that William Rising,\r\nprior of Christ’s church, was sworn alderman of the said Portsoken ward\r\nin the 1st of Richard II. These priors have sitten and ridden amongst\r\nthe aldermen of London, in livery like unto them, saving that his\r\nhabit was in shape of a spiritual person, as I myself have seen in my\r\nchildhood; at which time the prior kept a most bountiful house of meat\r\nand drink, both for rich and poor, as well within the house as at the\r\ngates, to all comers, according to their estates.\r\n\r\nThese were the monuments in this church:--Sir Robert Turke, and Dame\r\nAlice his wife; John Tirell, esquire; Simon Kempe, esquire; James\r\nManthorpe, esquire; John Ascue, esquire; Thomas Fauset, of Scalset,\r\nesquire; John Kempe, gentleman; Robert Chirwide, esquire; Sir John\r\nHeningham, and Dame Isabel his wife; Dame Agnes, wife first to Sir\r\nWilliam Bardolph, and then to Sir Thomas Mortimer; John Ashfield,\r\nesquire; Sir John Dedham, knight; Sir Ambrose Charcam; Joan, wife to\r\nThomas Nuck, gentleman; John Husse, esquire; John Beringham, esquire;\r\nThomas Goodwine, esquire; Ralph Walles, esquire; Dame Margaret, daughter\r\nto Sir Ralph Chevie, wife to Sir John Barkeley, to Sir Thomas Barnes,\r\nand to Sir W. Bursire; William Roofe; Simon Francis; John Breton,\r\nesquire; Helling, esquire; John Malwen and his wife; Anthonie Wels, son\r\nto John Wels; Nicholas de Avesey, and Margarie his wife; Anthonie, son\r\nto John Milles; Baldwine, son to King Stephen, and Mathilde, daughter\r\nto King Stephen, wife to the Earl of Meulan; Henry Fitzalwine, mayor of\r\nLondon, 1213; Geffrey Mandevile, 1215; and many other. But to conclude\r\nof this priory: King Henry VIII., minding to reward Sir Thomas Audley,\r\nspeaker of the parliament against Cardinal Wolsey, as ye may read in\r\nHall, sent for the prior, commending him for his hospitality, promised\r\nhim preferment, as a man worthy of a far greater dignity, which promise\r\nsurely he performed, and compounded with him, though in what sort I\r\nnever heard, so that the prior surrendered all that priory, with the\r\nappurtenances, to the king, in the month of July, in the year 1531, the\r\n23rd of the said king’s reign. The canons were sent to other houses of\r\nthe same order, and the priory, with the appurtenances, King Henry gave\r\nto Sir Thomas Audley, newly knighted, and after made lord chancellor.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Audley offered the great church of this priory, with a ring\r\nof nine bells well tuned (whereof four the greatest were since sold\r\nto the parish of Stebunhith, and the five lesser to the parish of St.\r\nStephen in Coleman street) to the parishioners of St. Katherine Christ\r\nchurch, in exchange for their small parish church, minding to have\r\npulled it down, and to have built there towards the street; but the\r\nparishioners having doubts in their heads of after-claps, refused the\r\noffer. Then was the priory church and steeple proffered to whomsoever\r\nwould take it down, and carry it from the ground, but no man would\r\nundertake the offer; whereupon Sir Thomas Audley was fain to be at more\r\ncharges than could be made of the stones, timber, lead, iron, etc. For\r\nthe workmen, with great labour, beginning at the top, loosed stone from\r\nstone, and threw them down, whereby the most part of them were broken,\r\nand few remained whole; and those were sold very cheap, for all the\r\nbuildings then made about the city were of brick and timber. At that\r\ntime any man in the city might have a cart-load of hard stone for paving\r\nbrought to his door for six pence or seven pence, with the carriage. The\r\nsaid Thomas Lord Audley built and dwelt on this priory during his life,\r\nand died there in the year 1544; since the which time the said priory\r\ncame by marriage of the Lord Audley’s daughter and heir unto Thomas,\r\nlate Duke of Norfolk, and was then called the Duke’s place.\r\n\r\nThe parish church of St. Katherine standeth in the cemetery of the\r\nlate dissolved priory of the Holy Trinity, and is therefore called St.\r\nKatherine Christ church. This church seemeth to be very old; since the\r\nbuilding whereof the high street hath been so often raised by pavements,\r\nthat now men are fain to descend into the said church by divers steps,\r\nseven in number. But the steeple, or bell-tower thereof, hath been\r\nlately built, to wit, about the year 1504; for Sir John Percivall,\r\nmerchant-tailor, then deceasing, gave money towards the building\r\nthereof. There be the monuments of Sir Thomas Fleming, knight of Rowles,\r\nin Essex, and Margaret his wife, 1464; Roger Marshall, esquire; Jane\r\nHorne, wife to Roger Marshall; William Multon, alias Burdeaux, herald;\r\nJohn Goad, esquire, and Joan his wife; Beatrix, daughter to William\r\nBrowne; Thomas Multon, esquire, son to Burdeaux, herald; John Chitcroft,\r\nesquire; John Wakefielde, esquire; William Criswicke; Anne and Sewch,\r\ndaughters to Ralph Shirley, esquire; Sir John Rainsford, knight of\r\nEssex; Sir Nicholas Throkmorton, chief butler of England, one of the\r\nchamberlains of the exchequer, ambassador, etc., 1570, and other.\r\n\r\nAt the north-west corner of this ward, in the said high street,\r\nstandeth the fair and beautiful parish church of St. Andrew the Apostle;\r\nwith an addition, to be known from other churches of that name, of the\r\nknape or undershaft; and so called St. Andrew Undershaft, because that\r\nof old time, every year on May-day in the morning, it was used, that\r\nan high or long shaft or May-pole, was set up there, in the midst of\r\nthe street, before the south side of the said church; which shaft when\r\nit was set on end and fixed in the ground, was higher than the church\r\nsteeple. Geffrey Chaucer, writing of a vain boaster, hath these words,\r\nmeaning of the said shaft:\r\n\r\n    “Right well aloft, and high ye beare your heade,\r\n    The weather cocke, with flying, as ye would kill,\r\n    When ye be stuffed, bet of wine, then brede,\r\n    Then looke ye, when your wombe doth fill,\r\n    As ye would beare the great shaft of Cornehill,\r\n    Lord, so merrily crowdeth then your croke,\r\n    That all the streete may heare your body cloke.”\r\n\r\nThis shaft was not raised at any time since evil May-day (so called of\r\nan insurrection made by apprentices and other young persons against\r\naliens in the year 1517); but the said shaft was laid along over the\r\ndoors, and under the pentises of one row of houses and alley gate,\r\ncalled of the shaft Shaft alley (being of the possessions of Rochester\r\nbridge), in the ward of Lime street. It was there, I say, hung on iron\r\nhooks many years, till the third of King Edward VI., that one Sir\r\nStephen, curate of St. Katherine Christ’s church, preaching at Paules\r\ncross, said there that this shaft was made an idol, by naming the church\r\nof St. Andrew with the addition of “under that shaft:” he persuaded\r\ntherefore that the names of churches might be altered; also that the\r\nnames of days in the week might be changed; the fish days to be kept\r\nany days except Friday and Saturday, and the Lent any time, save only\r\nbetwixt Shrovetide and Easter. I have oft times seen this man, forsaking\r\nthe pulpit of his said parish church, preach out of a high elm-tree[139]\r\nin the midst of the churchyard, and then entering the church, forsaking\r\nthe altar, to have sung his high mass in English upon a tomb of the dead\r\ntowards the north. I heard his sermon at Paules cross, and I saw the\r\neffect that followed; for in the afternoon of that present Sunday, the\r\nneighbours and tenants to the said bridge, over whose doors the said\r\nshaft had lain, after they had well dined, to make themselves strong,\r\ngathered more help, and with great labour raising the shaft from the\r\nhooks, whereon it had rested two-and-thirty years, they sawed it in\r\npieces, every man taking for his share so much as had lain over his door\r\nand stall, the length of his house; and they of the alley divided among\r\nthem so much as had lain over their alley gate. Thus was this idol (as\r\nhe[140] termed it) mangled, and after burned.\r\n\r\nSoon after was there a commotion of the commons in Norfolk, Suffolk,\r\nEssex, and other shires; by means whereof, straight orders being taken\r\nfor the suppression of rumours, divers persons were apprehended and\r\nexecuted by martial law; amongst the which the bailiff of Romfort, in\r\nEssex, was one, a man very well beloved: he was early in the morning\r\nof Mary Magdalen’s day, then kept holiday, brought by the sheriffs of\r\nLondon and the knight-marshal to the well within Aldgate, there to be\r\nexecuted upon a gibbet set up that morning, where, being on the ladder,\r\nhe had words to this effect: “Good people, I am come hither to die, but\r\nknow not for what offence, except for words by me spoken yesternight to\r\nSir Stephen, curate and preacher of this parish, which were these: He\r\nasked me, ‘What news in the country?’ I answered, ‘Heavy news.’ ‘Why?’\r\nquoth he. ‘It is said,’ quoth I, ‘that many men be up in Essex, but,\r\nthanks be to God, all is in good quiet about us:’ and this was all, as\r\nGod be my judge,” etc. Upon these words of the prisoner, Sir Stephen,\r\nto avoid reproach of the people, left the city, and was never heard of\r\nsince amongst them to my knowledge. I heard the words of the prisoner,\r\nfor he was executed upon the pavement of my door where I then kept\r\nhouse. Thus much by digression: now again to the parish church of St.\r\nAndrew Undershaft, for it still retaineth the name, which hath been new\r\nbuilt by the parishioners there since the year 1520; every man putting\r\nto his helping hand, some with their purses, other with their bodies.\r\nSteven Gennings, merchant-tailor, sometime mayor of London, caused at\r\nhis charges to be built[141] the whole north side of the great middle\r\naisle, both of the body and choir, as appeareth by his arms over every\r\npillar graven, and also the north isle, which he roofed with timber and\r\nsealed; also the whole south side of the church was glazed, and the pews\r\nin the south chapel made of his costs, as appeareth in every window,\r\nand upon the said pews. He deceased in the year 1524, and was buried in\r\nthe Grey friars church. John Kerkbie, merchant-tailor, sometime one of\r\nthe sheriffs, John Garlande, merchant-tailor, and Nicholas Levison,\r\nmercer, executor to Garlande, were great benefactors to this work; which\r\nwas finished to the glazing in the year 1529, and fully finished 1532.\r\nBuried in this church:[142] Philip Malpas, one of the sheriffs, 1439;\r\nSir Robert Dennie, knight, and after him Thomas Dennie, his son, in the\r\nyear 1421; Thomas Stokes, gentleman, grocer, 1496. In the new church:\r\nJohn Nichell, merchant-tailor, 1537; William Draper, esquire, 1537;\r\nIsabell and Margaret, his wives; Nicholas Levison, mercer, one of the\r\nsheriffs, 1534; John Gerrarde, woolman, merchant of the staple, 1456;\r\nHenry Man, doctor of divinity, bishop of Man, 1550; Stephen Kyrton,\r\nmerchant-tailor, alderman, 1553; David Woodroffe, haberdasher, one of\r\nthe sheriffs, 1554; Stephen Woodroffe, his son, gave one hundred pounds\r\nin money, for the which the poor of that parish receive two shillings in\r\nbread weekly for ever; Sir Thomas Offley, merchant-tailor, mayor, 1556;\r\nhe bequeathed the one half of all his goods to charitable actions, but\r\nthe parish received little benefit thereby; Thomas Starkey, skinner, one\r\nof the sheriffs, 1578; Hugh Offley, leatherseller, one of the sheriffs,\r\n1588; William Hanbury, baker.\r\n\r\nNow down St. Mary street, by the west end of the church towards the\r\nnorth, stand divers fair houses for merchants and other; namely, one\r\nfair great house, built by Sir William Pickering the father, possessed\r\nby Sir William his son, and since by Sir Edward Wootton of Kent. North\r\nfrom this place is the Fletchers’ hall, and so down to the corner of\r\nthat street, over against London wall, and against eastwards to a fair\r\nhouse lately new built, partly by Master Robert Beale, one of the clerks\r\nof the council.\r\n\r\nThen come you to the Papey, a proper house, wherein sometime was kept a\r\nfraternity or brotherhood of St. Charity and St. John Evangelist, called\r\nthe Papey, for poor impotent priests (for in some language priests are\r\ncalled papes), founded in the year 1430 by William Oliver, William\r\nBarnabie, and John Stafford, chaplains or chantry priests in London,\r\nfor a master, two wardens, etc., chaplains, chantry priests, conducts,\r\nand other brethren and sisters, that should be admitted into the church\r\nof St. Augustine Papey in the wall. The brethren of this house becoming\r\nlame, or otherwise into great poverty, were here relieved, as to have\r\nchambers, with certain allowance of bread, drink, and coal, and one\r\nold man and his wife to see them served and to keep the house clean.\r\nThis brotherhood, among others, was suppressed in the reign of Edward\r\nVI.; since the which time in this house hath been lodged Master Moris\r\nof Essex; Sir Francis Walsingham, principal secretary to her majesty;\r\nMaster Barret of Essex, etc.\r\n\r\nThen next is one great house, large of rooms, fair courts, and\r\ngarden-plots; sometimes pertaining to the Bassets, since that to the\r\nabbots of Bury in Suffolk, and therefore called Buries markes, corruptly\r\nBevis markes, and since the dissolution of the abbey of Bury, to Thomas\r\nHenage the father, and to Sir Thomas his son. Then next unto it is the\r\nbefore-spoken priory of the Holy Trinity; to wit, the west and north\r\npart thereof, which stretcheth up to Aldgate, where we first began.\r\n\r\nNow in the second way from Aldgate, more toward the south from the\r\nwell or pump aforesaid, lieth Fenne church street; on the right hand\r\nwhereof, somewhat west from the south end of Belzetter’s lane is the\r\nIronmongers’ hall; which company was incorporated in the 3rd of Edward\r\nIV. Richard Fleming was their first master; Nicholas Marshall and\r\nRichard Cox were custos, or wardens. And on the left hand, or south\r\nside, even by the gate and wall of the city, runneth down a lane to the\r\nTower hill; the south part whereof is called Woodroffe lane, and out of\r\nthis lane toward the west a street called Hart street. In this street,\r\nat the south-east corner thereof, sometime stood one house of Crouched\r\n(or crossed) friars, founded by Ralph Hosiar and William Sabernes about\r\nthe year 1298. Stephen, the tenth prior of the Holy Trinity, in London\r\ngranted there tenements for 13_s._ 8_d._ by the year unto the said\r\nRalph Hosiar and William Sabernes, who afterwards became friars of St.\r\nCrosse; Adam was the first prior of that house. These friars founded\r\ntheir house in place of certain tenements purchased of Richard Wimbush,\r\nthe twelfth prior of the Holy Trinity, in the year 1319, which was\r\nconfirmed by Edward III. the 17th of his reign, valued at £52 13_s._\r\n4_d._, surrendered the twelfth of November, the 30th of Henry VIII. In\r\nthis house was buried Master John Tirres; Nicholas, the son of William\r\nKyriell, esquire; Sir Thomas Mellington, baron of Wemesse, and Dame\r\nElizabeth his wife, daughter and heir of William Botelar, baron of Wome;\r\nRobert Mellington, esquire, and Elizabeth his wife, daughter to Ferreis\r\nof Ousley; Henry Lovell, son to William Lord Lovell; Dame Isabel, wife\r\nto William Edwarde, mayor of London, 1471; William Narborough, and Dame\r\nElizabeth his wife; William Narborough, and Dame Beatrix his wife;\r\nWilliam Brosked, esquire; William Bowes; Lionel Mollington, esquire,\r\nson of Robert Mollington; Nicholas Couderow, and Elizabeth his wife;\r\nSir John Stratford, knight; Sir Thomas Asseldy, knight, clerk of the\r\ncrown, sub-marshal of England, and justice of the shire of Middlesex;\r\nJohn Rest, grocer, mayor of London, 1516; Sir John Skevington, knight,\r\nmerchant-tailor, sheriff, 1520; Sir John Milborne, draper, mayor in\r\nthe year 1520, was buried there, but removed since to St. Edmondes in\r\nLombard street; Sir Rice Grifith, beheaded on the Tower hill, 1531.\r\n\r\nIn place of this church is now a carpenters’ yard, a tennis court, and\r\nsuch like; the friars’ hall was made a glass-house, or house wherein\r\nwas made glass of divers sorts to drink in; which house in the year\r\n1575, on the 4th of September, burst out into a terrible fire, where\r\nbeing practised all means possible to quench, notwithstanding as the\r\nsame house in a small time before had consumed a great quantity of wood\r\nby making of glasses, now itself having within it about forty thousand\r\nbillets of wood, was all consumed to the stone walls, which nevertheless\r\ngreatly hindered the fire from spreading any further.\r\n\r\nAdjoining unto this friars’ church, by the east end thereof in Woodroffe\r\nlane towards the Tower hill, are certain proper alms houses, fourteen in\r\nnumber, built of brick and timber, founded by Sir John Milborne, draper,\r\nsometime mayor, 1521, wherein he placed thirteen aged poor men and their\r\nwives, if they have wives: these have their dwellings rent free, and\r\n2_s._ 4_d._ the piece, the first day of every month, for ever. One also\r\nis to have his house over the gate, and 4_s._ every month: more, he\r\nappointed every Sunday for ever, thirteen penny loaves of white bread,\r\nto be given in the parish church of St. Edmonde in Lombard street, to\r\nthirteen poor people of that parish; and the like thirteen loaves to be\r\ngiven in the parish church of St. Michael upon Cornhill, and in either\r\nparish every year one load of chare coal, of thirty sacks in the load;\r\nand this gift to be continued for ever: for performance whereof, by the\r\nmaster and wardens of the drapers in London, he assured unto them and\r\ntheir successors twenty-three messuages and tenements, and eighteen\r\ngarden-plots, in the parish of St. Olave in Hart street; with proviso,\r\nthat if they perform not those points[143] above-mentioned, the said\r\ntenements and gardens to remain to the mayor and commonalty of the city\r\nof London.\r\n\r\nNext to these alms houses is the Lord Lumley’s house, built in the time\r\nof King Henry VIII. by Sir Thomas Wiat the father, upon one plot of\r\nground of late pertaining to the foresaid Crossed friars, where part of\r\ntheir house stood: and this is the farthest part of Aldgate ward towards\r\nthe south, and joineth to the Tower hill. The other side of that line,\r\nover against the Lord Lumley’s house, on the wall side of the city, is\r\nnow for the most part (or altogether) built even to Aldgate.\r\n\r\nThen have you on the south side of Fenchurch street, over against the\r\nwell or pump, amongst other fair and large built houses, one that\r\nsometime belonged to the prior of Monte Joves, or Monastery Cornute,\r\na cell to Monte Joves beyond the seas, in Essex: it was the prior’s\r\ninn, when he repaired to this city. Then a lane that leadeth down by\r\nNorthumberland house towards the Crossed friars, as is afore showed.\r\n\r\nThis Northumberland house, in the parish of St. Katherine Colman,\r\nbelonged to Henry Percie, Earl of Northumberland, in the 33rd of Henry\r\nVI., but of late being left by the earls, the gardens thereof were made\r\ninto bowling alleys, and other parts into dicing houses, common to all\r\ncomers for their money, there to bowle and hazard; but now of late so\r\nmany bowling alleys, and other houses for unlawful gaming, hath been\r\nraised in other parts of the city and suburbs, that this their ancient\r\nand only patron of misrule, is left and forsaken of her gamesters, and\r\ntherefore turned into a number of great rents, small cottages, for\r\nstrangers and others.\r\n\r\nAt the east end of this lane, in the way from Aldgate toward the Crossed\r\nfriars, of old time were certain tenements called the poor Jurie, of\r\nJews dwelling there.\r\n\r\nNext unto this Northumberland house is the parish church of St.\r\nKatherine, called Coleman; which addition of Coleman was taken of a\r\ngreat haw-yard, or garden, of old time called Coleman haw, in the parish\r\nof the Trinity, now called Christ’s church, and in the parish of St.\r\nKatherine and All Saints called Coleman church.\r\n\r\nThen have you Blanch Apleton; whereof I read, in the 13th of Edward I.,\r\nthat a lane behind the said Blanch Apleton was granted by the king to\r\nbe inclosed and shut up. This Blanch Apleton was a manor belonging to\r\nSir Thomas Roos of Hamelake, knight, the 7th of Richard II., standing at\r\nthe north-east corner of Mart lane, so called of a privilege sometime\r\nenjoined to keep a mart there, long since discontinued, and therefore\r\nforgotten, so as nothing remaineth for memory but the name of Mart\r\nlane, and that corruptly termed Marke lane. I read that, in the third\r\nof Edward IV., all basket-makers, wire-drawers, and other foreigners,\r\nwere permitted to have shops in this manor of Blanch Apleton, and not\r\nelsewhere, within this city or suburbs thereof; and this also being\r\nthe farthest west part of this ward on that south side, I leave it,\r\nwith three parish churches, St Katherine Christ church, St. Andrew\r\nUndershaft, and St. Katherine Colemans; and three halls of companies,\r\nthe Bricklayers’ hall, the Fletchers’ hall, and the Ironmongers’ hall.\r\nIt hath an alderman, his deputy, common councillors six, constables six,\r\nscavengers nine, wardmote men for inquest eighteen, and a beadle. It is\r\ntaxed to the fifteen in London at five pounds.[144]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[139] “The said elm-tree, his preaching place, is lately taken\r\ndown.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\n[140] “As he, poore man, tearmed it.”--_1st edition_, p. 108.\r\n\r\n[141] “The one halfe, to wit.”--_1st edition_, p. 109.\r\n\r\n[142] “The monuments of the dead, buried in this church, are\r\nthese.”--_1st edition_, p. 109.\r\n\r\n[143] “These poyntes not performed.

Now for St. Mary street; the west side\r\nthereof is of this Lime street ward, and also the street which runneth\r\nby the north end of this St. Mary street, on both sides, from thence\r\nwest to an house called the Wrestlers, a sign so called, almost to\r\nBishopsgate. And these are the bounds of this small ward.\r\n\r\nMonuments, or places notable, in this ward be these:--In Lime street\r\nare divers fair houses for merchants and others; there was sometime a\r\nmansion-house of the kings, called the King’s Artirce, whereof I find\r\nrecord in the 14th of Edward I., but now grown out of knowledge. I read\r\nalso of another great house in the west side of Lime street, having a\r\nchapel on the south and a garden on the west, then belonging to the\r\nLord Nevill, which garden is now called the Green yard of the Leaden\r\nhall. This house, in the 9th of Richard II., pertained to Sir Simon\r\nBurley, and Sir John Burley his brother; and of late the said house\r\nwas taken down, and the forefront thereof new built of timber by Hugh\r\nOffley, alderman. At the north-west corner of Lime street was of old\r\ntime one great messuage called Benbrige’s inn; Ralph Holland, draper,\r\nabout the year 1452 gave it to John Gill, master, and to the wardens and\r\nfraternity of tailors and linen-armourers of St. John Baptist in London,\r\nand to their successors for ever. They did set up in place thereof a\r\nfair large frame of timber, containing in the high street one great\r\nhouse, and before it to the corner of Lime street three other tenements,\r\nthe corner house being the largest, and then down Lime street divers\r\nproper tenements; all which the merchant-tailors, in the reign of Edward\r\nVI., sold to Stephen Kirton, merchant-tailor and alderman: he gave, with\r\nhis daughter Grisild, to Nicholas Woodroffe the said great house, with\r\ntwo tenements before it, in lieu of a hundred pounds, and made it up in\r\nmoney £366 13_s._ 4_d._ This worshipful man, and the gentlewoman his\r\nwidow after him, kept those houses down Lime street in good reparations,\r\nnever put out but one tenant, took no fines, nor raised rents of them,\r\nwhich was ten shillings the piece yearly: but whether that favour did\r\noverlive her funeral, the tenants now can best declare the contrary.\r\n\r\nNext unto this, on the high street, was the Lord Sowche’s messuage or\r\ntenement, and other; in place whereof, Richard Wethell, merchant-tailor,\r\nbuilt a fair house, with a high tower, the second in number, and first\r\nof timber, that ever I learnt to have been built to overlook neighbours\r\nin this city.\r\n\r\nThis Richard, then a young man, became in a short time so tormented with\r\ngouts in his joints, of the hands and legs, that he could neither feed\r\nhimself nor go further than he was led; much less was he able to climb\r\nand take the pleasure of the height of his tower. Then is there another\r\nfair house, built by Stephen Kirton, alderman; Alderman Lee doth now\r\npossess it, and again new buildeth it.\r\n\r\nThen is there a fair house of old time called the Green gate; by which\r\nname one Michael Pistoy Lumbard held it, with a tenement and nine shops\r\nin the reign of Richard II., who in the 15th of his reign gave it to\r\nRoger Crophull, and Thomas Bromeflet, esquires, by the name of the Green\r\ngate, in the parish of St. Andrew upon Cornhill, in Lime street ward;\r\nsince the which time Philip Malpas, sometime alderman, and one of the\r\nsheriffs, dwelt therein, and was there robbed and spoiled of his goods\r\nto a great value by Jack Cade, and other rebels, in the year 1449.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, in the reign of Henry VII., it was seized into the\r\nking’s hands, and then granted, first, unto John Alston, after that\r\nunto William de la Rivers, and since by Henry VIII. to John Mutas, a\r\nPicarde or Frenchman, who dwelt there, and harboured in his house many\r\nFrenchmen, that kalendred wolsteds, and did other things contrary to\r\nthe franchises of the citizens; wherefore on evil May-day, which was in\r\nthe year 1517, the apprentices and other spoiled his house; and if they\r\ncould have found Mutas, they would have stricken off his head. Sir Peter\r\nMutas, son to the said John Mutas, sold this house to David Woodroffe,\r\nalderman, whose son, Sir Nicholas Woodroffe, alderman, sold it over to\r\nJohn Moore, alderman, that now possesseth it.\r\n\r\nNext is a house called the Leaden porch, lately divided into two\r\ntenements; whereof one is a tavern, and then one other house for a\r\nmerchant, likewise called the Leaden porch, but now turned to a cook’s\r\nhouse. Next is a fair house and a large, wherein divers mayoralties have\r\nbeen kept, whereof twain in my remembrance; to wit, Sir William Bowyar\r\nand Sir Henry Huberthorne.\r\n\r\nThe next is Leaden hall, of which I read, that in the year 1309 it\r\nbelonged to Sir Hugh Nevill, knight, and that the Lady Alice his\r\nwidow made a feoffment thereof, by the name of Leaden hall, with the\r\nadvowsons of the church of St. Peter upon Cornhill, and other churches,\r\nto Richard, Earl of Arundell and Surrey, 1362. More, in the year 1380,\r\nAlice Nevill, widow to Sir John Nevill, knight, of Essex, confirmed to\r\nThomas Gogshall and others the said manor of Leaden hall, the advowsons,\r\netc. In the year 1384, Humfrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford, had the said\r\nmanor. And in the year 1408, Robert Rikeden, of Essex, and Margaret his\r\nwife, confirmed to Richard Whittington, and other citizens of London,\r\nthe said manor of Leaden hall, with the appurtenances, the advowsons of\r\nSt. Peter’s church, St. Margaret’s Pattens, etc. And in the year 1411,\r\nthe said Whittington and other confirmed the same to the mayor and\r\ncommonalty of London, whereby it came to the possession of the city.\r\nThen in the year 1443, the 21st of Henry VI., John Hatherley, mayor,\r\npurchased license of the said king to take up two hundred fother of\r\nlead, for the building of water conduits, a common granary, and the\r\ncross in West Cheape, more richly, for the honour of the city. In the\r\nyear next following, the parson and parish of St. Dunston, in the east\r\nof London, seeing the famous and mighty man (for the words be in the\r\ngrant, _cum nobilis et potens vir_), Simon Eyre, citizen of London,\r\namong other his works of piety, effectually determined to erect and\r\nbuild a certain granary upon the soil of the same city at Leaden hall,\r\nof his own charges, for the common utility of the said city, to the\r\namplifying and enlarging of the said granary, granted to Henry Frowicke,\r\nthen mayor, the aldermen and commonalty, and their successors for\r\never, all their tenements, with the appurtenances, sometime called the\r\nHorsemill, in Grasse street, for the annual rent of four pounds, etc.\r\nAlso, certain evidences of an alley and tenements pertaining to the\r\nHorsemill adjoining to the said Leaden hall in Grasse street, given\r\nby William Kingstone, fishmonger, unto the parish church of St. Peter\r\nupon Cornehill, do specify the said granary to be built by the said\r\nhonourable and famous merchant, Simon Eyre, sometime an upholsterer,\r\nand then a draper, in the year 1419. He built it of squared stone, in\r\nform as now it showeth, with a fair and large chapel in the east side of\r\nthe quadrant, over the porch of which he caused to be written, _Dextra\r\nDomini exaltavit me_ (The Lord’s right hand exalted me). Within the said\r\nchurch, on the north wall, was written. _Honorandus famosus mercator\r\nSimon Eyre hujus operis_, etc. In English thus:--“The honourable and\r\nfamous merchant, Simon Eyre, founder of this work, once mayor of this\r\ncity, citizen and draper of the same, departed out of this life, the\r\n18th day of September, the year from the Incarnation of Christ 1459,\r\nand the 38th year of the reign of King Henry VI.” He was buried in\r\nthe parish church of St. Mary Woolnoth, in Lombard street: he gave by\r\nhis testament, which I have read, to be distributed to all prisons in\r\nLondon, or within a mile of that city, somewhat to relieve them. More,\r\nhe gave two thousand marks, upon a condition, which not performed, was\r\nthen to be distributed to maids’ marriages, and other deeds of charity;\r\nhe also gave three thousand marks to the drapers, upon condition they\r\nshould, within one year after his decease, establish perpetually a\r\nmaster or warden, five secular priests, six clerks, and two choristers,\r\nto sing daily Divine service by note for ever, in his chapel of the\r\nLeaden hall; also,[145] one master, with an usher, for grammar, one\r\nmaster for writing, and the third for song, with housing there newly\r\nbuilt for them for ever; the master to have for his salary ten pounds,\r\nand every other priest eight pounds, every other clerk five pounds six\r\nshillings and eight pence, and every other chorister five marks; and\r\nif the drapers refused this to do, within one year after his decease,\r\nthen the three thousand marks to remain to the prior and convent of\r\nChrist’s church in London, with condition to establish, as is aforesaid,\r\nwithin two years after his decease; and if they refused, then the three\r\nthousand marks to be disposed by his executors, as they best could\r\ndevise, in works of charity. Thus much for his testament, not performed\r\nby establishing of Divine service in his chapel, or free schools for\r\nscholars; neither how the stock of three thousand marks, or rather five\r\nthousand marks, was employed by his executors, could I ever learn. He\r\nleft issue, Thomas, who had issue, Thomas, etc. True it is, that in\r\none year, 1464, the 3rd of Edward IV., it was agreed by the mayor,\r\naldermen, and commonalty of London, that notwithstanding the king’s\r\nletters patent, lately before granted unto them, touching the tronage or\r\nweighing of wares to be holden at the Leaden hall, yet suit should be\r\nmade to the king for new letters patent to be granted to the mayor of\r\nthe staple for the tronage of wools to be holden there, and order to be\r\ntaken by the discretion of Thomas Cooke, then mayor, the counsel of the\r\ncity, Geffrey Filding, then mayor of the staple at Westminster, and of\r\nthe king’s council, what should be paid to the mayor and aldermen of the\r\ncity, for the laying and housing of the wools there, that so they might\r\nbe brought forth and weighed, etc.\r\n\r\nTouching the chapel there, I find, that in the year 1466, by license\r\nobtained of King Edward IV., in the 6th of his reign, a fraternity of\r\nthe Trinity, of sixty priests, besides other brethren and sisters, in\r\nthe same chapel, was founded by William Rouse, John Risbie, and Thomas\r\nAshby priests, some of the which sixty priests, every market-day in\r\nthe forenoon, did celebrate Divine service there to such market-people\r\nas repaired to prayer; and once every year they met all together and\r\nhad solemn service, with procession of the brethren and sisters. This\r\nfoundation was in the year 1512, by a common council, confirmed to the\r\nsixty Trinity priests, and to their successors, at the will of the mayor\r\nand commonalty.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1484, a great fire happened upon this Leaden hall, by what\r\ncasualty I know not, but much housing was there destroyed, with all the\r\nstocks for guns, and other provision belonging to the city, which was a\r\ngreat loss, and no less charge to be repaired by them.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1503, the 18th of Henry VII., a request was made by the\r\ncommons of the city, concerning the usage of the said Leaden hall, in\r\nform as followeth:--“Please it, the lord mayor, and common council, to\r\nenact, that all Frenchmen bringing canvass, linen cloth, and other\r\nwares to be sold, and all foreigners bringing wolsteds, sayes, staimus,\r\ncoverings, nails, iron work, or any other wares, and also all manner\r\nof foreigners bringing lead to the city to be sold, shall bring all\r\nsuch their wares aforesaid to the open market of the Leaden hall, there\r\nand no where else to be sold and uttered, like as of old time it hath\r\nbeen used, upon pain of forfeiture of all the said wares showed or\r\nsold in any other place than aforesaid; the show of the said wares to\r\nbe made three days in the week, that is to say, Monday, Tuesday, and\r\nWednesday; it is also thought reasonable that the common beam be kept\r\nfrom henceforth in the Leaden hall, and the farmer to pay therefore\r\nreasonable rent to the chamber; for better it is that the chamber have\r\nadvantage thereby than a foreign person; and also the said Leaden hall,\r\nwhich is more chargeable now by half than profitable, shall better bear\r\nout the charges thereof; also the common beam for wool at Leaden hall,\r\nmay yearly pay a rent to the chamber of London, toward supportation\r\nand charges of the same place; for reason it is, that a common office,\r\noccupied upon a common ground, bear a charge to the use of the\r\ncommonalty; also, that foreigners bringing wools, felts, or any other\r\nmerchandises or wares to Leaden hall, to be kept there for the sale and\r\nmarket, may pay more largely for the keeping of their goods than free\r\nmen.” Thus much for the request of the commons at this time.\r\n\r\nNow to set down some proof that the said hall hath been employed and\r\nused as a granary for corn and grain (as the same was first appointed),\r\nleaving all former examples, this one may suffice: Roger Achley, mayor\r\nof London in the year 1512, the 3rd of Henry VIII., when the said mayor\r\nentered the mayoralty, there was not found one hundred quarters of wheat\r\nin all the garners of the city, either within the liberties, or near\r\nadjoining; through the which scarcity, when the carts of Stratford came\r\nladen with bread to the city (as they had been accustomed) there was\r\nsuch press about them, that one man was ready to destroy another, in\r\nstriving to be served for their money. But this scarcity did not last\r\nlong; for the mayor in short time made such provision of wheat, that the\r\nbakers, both of London and Stratford, were weary of taking it up, and\r\nwere forced to take up much more than they would, and for the rest the\r\nmayor laid out the money, and stored it up in Leaden hall, and other\r\ngarners of the city. This mayor also kept the market so well, that he\r\nwould be at the Leaden hall by four o’clock in the summer’s mornings;\r\nand from thence he went to other markets, to the great comfort of the\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nI read also that in the year 1528, the 20th of Henry VIII., surveyors\r\nwere appointed to view the garners of the city, namely, the Bridgehouse\r\nand the Leaden hall, how they were stored of grain for the service of\r\nthe city. And because I have here before spoken of the bread carts\r\ncoming from Stratford at the Bow, ye shall understand that of old time\r\nthe bakers of bread at Stratford were allowed to bring daily (except the\r\nSabbath and principal feasts) divers long carts laden with bread, the\r\nsame being two ounces in the penny wheat loaf heavier than the penny\r\nwheat loaf baked in the city, the same to be sold in Cheape, three or\r\nfour carts standing there, between Gutheron’s lane and Fauster’s lane\r\nend, one cart on Cornhill, by the conduit, and one other in Grasse\r\nstreet. And I have read, that in the 4th year of Edward II., Richard\r\nReffeham being mayor, a baker named John of Stratforde, for making bread\r\nless than the assize, was with a fool’s hood on his head, and loaves\r\nof bread about his neck, drawn on a hurdle through the streets of this\r\ncity. Moreover, in the 44th of Edward III., John Chichester being mayor\r\nof London, I read in the _Visions of Pierce Plowman_, a book so called,\r\nas followeth:\r\n\r\n    “At Londone, I leve,\r\n    Liketh wel my wafres;\r\n    And louren whan thei lakken hem.\r\n    It is noght longe y passed,\r\n    There was a careful commune,\r\n    Whan no cart com to towne\r\n    With breed fro Stratforde;\r\n    Tho gonnen beggaris wepe,\r\n    And werkmen were agast a lite;\r\n    This wole be thought longe.\r\n    In the date of oure Drighte,\r\n    In a drye Aprill,\r\n    A thousand and thre hundred\r\n    Twies twenty and ten,\r\n    My wafres there were gesene\r\n    Whan Chichestre was maire.”[146]\r\n\r\nI read also in the 20th of Henry VIII., Sir James Spencer being mayor,\r\nsix bakers of Stratford were amerced in the Guildhall of London, for\r\nbaking under the size appointed. These bakers of Stratford left serving\r\nof this city, I know not upon what occasion, about thirty years since.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1519 a petition was exhibited by the commons to the common\r\ncouncil, and was by them allowed, concerning the Leaden hall, how they\r\nwould have it used, viz. “Meekly beseeching, showeth unto your good\r\nlordship and masterships, divers citizens of this city, which under\r\ncorrection think, that the great place called the Leaden hall should,\r\nnor ought not to be letten to farm to any person or persons, and in\r\nespecial to any fellowship or company incorporate, to have and hold the\r\nsame hall for term of years, for such inconveniences as thereby may\r\nensue, and come to the hurt of the common weal of the said city in time\r\nto come, as somewhat more largely may appear in the articles following.\r\n\r\n“First, If any assembly or hasty gathering of the commons of the said\r\ncity, for suppressing or subduing of misruled people within the said\r\ncity, hereafter shall happen to be called or commanded by the mayor,\r\naldermen, and other governors and councillors of the said city for the\r\ntime being, there is none so convenient, meet, and necessary a place,\r\nto assemble them in, within the said city, as the said Leaden hall,\r\nboth for largeness of room, and their sure defence in time of their\r\ncounselling together about the premises. Also, in that place hath been\r\nused the artillery, guns, and other armours of the said city, to be\r\nsafely kept in a readiness for the safeguard, wealth, and defence of\r\nthe said city, to be had and occupied at times when need required. As\r\nalso the store of timber for the necessary reparations of the tenements\r\nbelonging to the chamber of the said city, there commonly hath been\r\nkept. Item, If any triumph or nobleness were to be done, or shown by\r\nthe commonalty of the city, for the honour of our sovereign lord the\r\nking and realm, and for the worship of the said city, the said Leaden\r\nhall is most meet and convenient place to prepare and order the said\r\ntriumph therein, and from thence to issue forth to the places therefore\r\nappointed. Item, at any largess or dole of any money made unto the poor\r\npeople of this city, it hath been used to be done and given in the said\r\nLeaden hall, for that the said place is most meet therefore. Item, the\r\nhonourable father, that was maker of the said hall, had a special will,\r\nintent, and mind, that (as it is commonly said) the market men and\r\nwomen that came to the city with victuals and other things, should have\r\ntheir free standing within the said Leaden hall in wet weather, to keep\r\nthemselves and their wares dry, and thereby to encourage them, and all\r\nother, to have the better will and desire the more plenteously to resort\r\nto the said city, to victual the same. And if the said hall should be\r\nletten to farm, the will of the said honourable father should never be\r\nfulfilled nor take effect. Item, if the said place, which is the chief\r\nfortress, and most necessary place within all the city, for the tuition\r\nand safeguard of the same, should be letten to farm out of the hands\r\nof the chief heads of the same city, and especially to another body\r\npolitic, it might at length by likelihood be occasion of discord and\r\ndebate between the said bodies politic, which God defend.\r\n\r\n“For these and many other great and reasonable causes, which hereafter\r\nshall be showed to this honourable court, your said beseechers think it\r\nmuch necessary that the said hall be still in the hands of this city,\r\nand to be surely kept by sad and discreet officers, in such wise, that\r\nit may alway be ready to be used and occupied for the common weal of the\r\nsaid city when need shall require, and in no wise to be letten to any\r\nbody politic.”\r\n\r\nThus much for the petition.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1534, great means were made about the Leaden hall to have\r\nthe same made a burse, for the assembly of merchants, as they had been\r\naccustomed in Lombard street; many common councils were called to that\r\nend: but in the year 1535, John Champneys being mayor, it was fully\r\nconcluded that the burse should remain in Lombard street as afore, and\r\nLeaden hall no more to be spoken of concerning that matter.\r\n\r\nThe use of Leaden hall in my youth was thus:,--In a part of the north\r\nquadrant, on the east side of the north gate, were the common beams for\r\nweighing of wool and other wares, as had been accustomed; on the west\r\nside the gate were the scales to weight meal; the other three sides were\r\nreserved for the most part to the making and resting of the pageants\r\nshowed at Midsummer in the watch; the remnant of the sides and quadrant\r\nwas employed for the stowage of wool sacks, but not closed up; the lofts\r\nabove were partly used by the painters in working for the decking of\r\npageants and other devices, for beautifying of the watch and watchmen;\r\nthe residue of the lofts were letten out to merchants, the wool winders\r\nand packers therein to wind and pack their wools. And thus much for\r\nLeaden hall may suffice.\r\n\r\nNow on the north of Lime street ward in the high street are divers fair\r\nhouses for merchants, and proper tenements for artificers, with an alley\r\nalso called Shaft alley, of the shaft or May-pole sometime resting over\r\nthe gate thereof, as I have declared in Aldgate ward. In the year 1576,\r\npartly at the charges of the parish of St. Andrew, and partly at the\r\ncharges of the chamber of London, a water-pump was raised in Lime street\r\nward, near unto Lime street corner; for the placing of the which pump,\r\nhaving broken up the ground, they were forced to dig more than two\r\nfathom deep[147] before they came to any main ground, where they found a\r\nhearth made of Britain, or rather Roman tile[148] every tile half a yard\r\nsquare, and about two inches thick; they found coal lying there also\r\n(for that lying whole will never consume); then digging one fathom into\r\nthe main, they found water sufficient, made their prall, and set up the\r\npump; which pump, with oft repairing and great charges to the parish,\r\ncontinued not four-and-twenty years, but being rotted, was taken up and\r\na new set in place in the year 1600. Thus much for the high street.\r\n\r\nIn St. Marie street had ye of old time a parish church of St. Marie\r\nthe Virgin, St. Ursula, and the eleven thousand Virgins, which church\r\nwas commonly called St. Marie at the Axe, of the sign of an axe, over\r\nagainst the east end thereof, or St. Marie Pellipar, of a plot of ground\r\nlying on the north side thereof, pertaining to the Skinners in London.\r\nThis parish, about the year 1565, was united to the parish church of St.\r\nAndrew Undershaft, and so was St. Mary at the Axe suppressed and letten\r\nout to be a warehouse for a merchant. Against the east end of this\r\nchurch was sometime a fair wall, now turned to a pump. Also against the\r\nnorth end of this St. Mary street, was sometime one other parish church\r\nof St. Augustine, called St. Augustine in the Wall, for that it stood\r\nadjoining to the wall of the city, and otherwise called St. Augustin’s\r\nPapey, or the poor, as I have read in the reign of Edward III. About\r\nthe year 1430, in the reign of Henry VI., the same church was allowed\r\nto the brethren of the Papey, the house of poor priests, whereof I have\r\nspoken in Aldgate ward. The parishioners of this church were appointed\r\nto the parish church of Allhallows in the wall, which is in Broad street\r\nward, this brotherhood called Papey, being suppressed, the church of St\r\nAugustin was pulled down, and in place thereof one Grey an apothecary\r\nbuilt a stable, hay-loft, etc. It is now a dwelling-house.[149] Those\r\ntwo parish churches, both lying in the ward of Lime street, being thus\r\nsuppressed, there is not any one parish church or place for Divine\r\nservice in that ward, but the inhabitants thereof repair to St. Peter\r\nin Cornhill ward, St. Andrew in Aldgate ward, Alhallows in the wall in\r\nBroad street ward, and some to St. Denis in Langborne ward.\r\n\r\nNow because of late there hath been some question, to what ward this\r\nchurch of St. Augustine Papey should of right belong, for the same hath\r\nbeen challenged by them of Aldgate ward, and without reason taken into\r\nBishopsgate ward from Lime street ward, I am somewhat to touch it. About\r\nthirty years since the chamber of London granted a lease of ground, in\r\nthese words: “lying near London wall in the ward of Lime street, from\r\nthe west of the said church or chapel of St. Augustine Papey towards\r\nBishopsgate,” etc. On the which plot of ground the lease built three\r\nfair tenements, and placed tenants there; these were charged to bear\r\nscot and lot, and some of them to bear office in Lime street ward; all\r\nwhich they did willingly without grudging. And when any suspected or\r\ndisordered persons were by the landlord placed there, the officers of\r\nLime street ward fetched them out of their houses, committed them to\r\nward, procured their due punishments, and banished them from thence;\r\nwhereby in short time that place was reformed, and brought into good\r\norder; which thing being noted by them of Aldgate ward, they moved their\r\nalderman, Sir Thomas Offley, to call in those houses to be of his ward;\r\nbut I myself showing a fair ledger book, sometimes pertaining to the\r\nlate dissolved priory of the Holy Trinity whithin Aldgate, wherein were\r\nset down the just bounds of Aldgate ward, before Sir Thomas Offley, Sir\r\nRowland Heyward, the common council, and wardmote inquest of the same\r\nLime street ward, Sir Thomas Offley gave over his challenge, and so\r\nthat matter rested in good quiet until the year 1579, that Sir Richard\r\nPype being mayor, and alderman of Bishopsgate ward, challenged those\r\nhouses to be of his ward, whereunto (without reason showed) Sir Rowland\r\nHeyward yielded. And thus is that side of the street, from the north\r\ncorner of St. Mary street almost to Bishopsgate, wherein is one plot\r\nof ground, letten by the chamberlain of London to the parish of St.\r\nMartin’s Oteswich, to be a churchyard or burying place for the dead of\r\nthat parish, etc., unjustly drawn and withholden from the ward of Lime\r\nstreet. Divers other proofs I could set down, but this one following\r\nmay suffice.--The mayor and aldermen of London made a grant to the\r\nfraternity of Papie in these words: “Be it remembered, that where now\r\nof late the master and wardens of the fraternity of the Papie have made\r\na brick wall, closing in the chapel of St. Augustine called Papie\r\nchapel, situate in the parish of All Saints in the Wall, in the ward of\r\nLime street, of the city of London; from the south-east corner of the\r\nwhich brick wall is a scutcheon of twenty-one feet of assize from the\r\nsaid corner eastward. And from the same scutcheon there to a messuage\r\nof fifty-five feet and a half westward, the said scutcheon breaketh\r\nout of line right southward betwixt the measures aforesaid three feet\r\nand five inches of assize, upon the common ground of the said city\r\naforesaid, Ralph Verney, mayor, and the aldermen of the same city, the\r\n22nd day of October, the 6th year of Edward IV., granted to John Hod,\r\npriest, and to Master John Bolte, and Thomas Pachet, priests, wardens\r\nof the fraternity of Papie aforesaid, and to their successors for ever,\r\netc., yielding four pence sterling yearly at Michaelmas.” And this is,\r\nsaith my book,[150] enrolled in the Guild hall of London; which is a\r\nsufficient proof the same plot of ground to be of Lime street ward, and\r\nnever otherwise accounted or challenged.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of this street, stretching west from St. Mary street\r\ntowards Bishopsgate street, there was of old time one large messuage\r\nbuilt of stone and timber, in the parish of St. Augustine in the Wall,\r\nnow the parish of Allhallows in the same wall, belonging to the Earl of\r\nOxford, for Richard de Vere, Earl of Oxford, possessed it in the 4th of\r\nHenry V.; but in process of time the lands of the earl fell to females,\r\namongst the which, one being married to Wingfielde of Suffolke, this\r\nhouse with the appurtenances fell to his lot, and was by his heir, Sir\r\nRobert Wingfield, sold to Master Edward Coke, at this time the queen’s\r\nattorney-general. This house being greatly ruinated of late time, for\r\nthe most part hath been letten out to poulterers, for stabling of horses\r\nand stowage of poultry, but now lately new built into a number of small\r\ntenements, letten out to strangers, and other mean people.\r\n\r\nOne note more of this ward, and so an end. I find of record, that in\r\nthe year 1371, the 45th of Edward III., a great subsidy of one hundred\r\nthousand pounds was granted towards the king’s wars in France, whereof\r\nthe clergy paid fifty thousand pounds, and the laity fifty thousand\r\npounds, to be levied to thirty-nine shires of England, containing\r\nparishes eight thousand six hundred, of every parish five pounds sixteen\r\nshillings, the greater to help the lesser. This city, as one of the\r\nshires, then containing twenty-four wards, and in them one hundred and\r\nten parishes, was therefore assessed to six hundred and thirty-five\r\npounds twelve shillings, whereof Lime street ward did bear thirty-four\r\nshillings and no more, so small a ward it was, and so accounted, as\r\nhaving no one whole parish therein, but small portions only of two\r\nparishes in that ward. This ward hath an alderman, his deputy, common\r\ncouncillors four, constables four, scavengers two, wardmote inquest\r\nsixteen, and a beadle; and is taxed to the fifteenth at one pound\r\nnineteen shillings and two pence three farthings.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[144] “It is taxed to the fifteene in London at 46 _li._, and accounted\r\nin the Exchequer to £45 10_s._”--_1st edition_, p. 113.\r\n\r\n[145] “Three schoolemaisters, with an usher, to wit.”--_1st edition_, p.\r\n118.\r\n\r\n[146] This passage is printed very incorrectly, and as prose, by Stow,\r\nwho makes the date “twice thirty and ten,” _i.e._ 1370 (which is\r\ncertainly the date of Chichester’s mayoralty), instead of “twice twenty\r\nand ten,” _i.e._ 1350, which is the reading of the MSS. and of the two\r\nearly printed editions.\r\n\r\n[147] “Cornhill street, in some place raysed two fadome higher than of\r\nolde time, as appeared by buildings found so deepe.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\n[148] “As they call it.”--_1st edition_, p. 123.\r\n\r\n[149] “Reserving the churchyard for a garden plot.”--_1st edition_, p.\r\n124.\r\n\r\n[150] Liber Papie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBISHOPSGATE WARD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next is Bishopsgate ward; whereof a part is without the gate and of\r\nthe suburbs, from the bars by St. Mary Spittle to Bishopsgate, and a\r\npart of Houndsditch; almost half thereof, also without the wall, is of\r\nthe same ward. Then within the gate is Bishopsgate street, so called of\r\nthe gate, to a pump, where sometimes was a fair well, with two buckets,\r\nby the east end of the parish church of St. Martin Oteswich, and then\r\nwinding by the west corner of Leaden hall down Grass street to the\r\ncorner over against Grass church; and this is the bounds of that ward.\r\n\r\nMonuments most to be noted are these: The parish church of St. Buttolph\r\nwithout Bishopsgate, in a fair churchyard, adjoining to the town ditch,\r\nupon the very bank thereof, but of old time inclosed with a comely wall\r\nof brick, lately repaired by Sir William Allen, mayor, in the year\r\n1571, because he was born in that parish, where also he was buried. An\r\nanchoress received 40_s._ the year of the sheriffs of London.\r\n\r\nNow without this churchyard wall is a causeye, leading to a quadrant,\r\ncalled Petty France, of Frenchmen dwelling there, and to other\r\ndwelling-houses, lately built on the bank of the said ditch by some\r\ncitizens of London, that more regarded their own private gain than the\r\ncommon good of the city; for by means of this causeye raised on the\r\nbank, and soilage of houses, with other filthiness cast into the ditch,\r\nthe same is now forced to a narrow channel, and almost filled up with\r\nunsavoury things, to the danger of impoisoning the whole city.\r\n\r\nNext unto the parish church of St. Buttolph is a fair inn for receipt of\r\ntravellers; then an hospital of St. Mary of Bethelem, founded by Simon\r\nFitz Mary, one of the sheriffs of London, in the year 1246: he founded\r\nit to have been a priory of canons, with brethren and sisters; and King\r\nEdward III. granted a protection, which I have seen, for the brethren,\r\n_Miliciæ beatæ Mariæ de Bethlem_, within the city of London, the 14th\r\nyear of his reign. It was an hospital for distracted people: Stephen\r\nGeninges, merchant-tailor, gave £40 towards purchase of the patronage by\r\nhis testament, 1523; the mayor and commonalty purchased the patronage\r\nthereof, with all the lands and tenements thereunto belonging, in the\r\nyear 1546: the same year King Henry VIII. gave this hospital unto the\r\ncity; the church and chapel whereof were taken down in the reign of\r\nQueen Elizabeth, and houses built there by the governors of Christ’s\r\nhospital in London. In this place people that be distraight in wits\r\nare, by the suit of their friends, received and kept as afore, but not\r\nwithout charges to their bringers in. In the year 1569, Sir Thomas Roe,\r\nmerchant-tailor, mayor, caused to be inclosed with a wall of brick\r\nabout one acre of ground, being part of the said hospital of Bethelem;\r\nto wit, on the west, on the bank of Deep Ditch, so called, parting the\r\nsaid hospital of Bethelem from the More field: this he did for burial\r\nand ease of such parishes in London as wanted ground convenient within\r\ntheir parishes. The lady his wife was there buried (by whose persuasion\r\nhe inclosed it), but himself, born in London, was buried in the parish\r\nchurch of Hackney.\r\n\r\nFrom this hospital northward, upon the street’s side, many houses have\r\nbeen built with alleys backward, of late time too much pestered with\r\npeople (a great cause of infection) up to the bars.\r\n\r\nThe other side of this high street from Bishopsgate and Hounds ditch,\r\nthe first building a large inn for receipt of travellers, and is called\r\nthe Dolphin, of such a sign. In the year 1513, Margaret Ricroft, widow,\r\ngave this house, with the gardens and appurtenances, unto William Gam,\r\nR. Clye, their wives, her daughters, and to their heirs, with condition\r\nthey yearly do give to the warden or governors of the Grey friers church\r\nwithin Newgate forty shillings, to find a student of divinity in the\r\nUniversity for ever. Then is there a fair house, of late built by John\r\nPowlet. Next to that, a far more large and beautiful house, with gardens\r\nof pleasure, bowling alleys, and such like, built by Jasper Fisher, free\r\nof the goldsmiths, late one of the six clerks of the chauncerie and a\r\njustice of the peace. It hath since for a time been the Earl of Oxford’s\r\nplace. The queen’s majesty Elizabeth hath lodged there. It now belongeth\r\nto Sir Roger Manars.[151] This house, being so large and sumptuously\r\nbuilt by a man of no greater calling, possessions, or wealth (for he was\r\nindebted to many) was mockingly called Fisher’s folly, and a rhythm was\r\nmade of it, and other the like, in this manner:\r\n\r\n    “Kirkebyes Castell, and Fishers Follie,\r\n    Spinilas pleasure, and Megses glorie.”\r\n\r\nAnd so of other like buildings about the city by citizens, men have not\r\nletted to speak their pleasure.\r\n\r\nFrom Fisher’s Folly up to the west end of Berward’s lane, of old time\r\nso called, but now Hogge lane, because it meeteth with Hogge lane,\r\nwhich cometh from the bars without Aldgate, as is afore showed, is a\r\ncontinual building of tenements, with alleys of cottages, pestered,\r\netc. Then is there a large close, called Tasel close, sometime for that\r\nthere were tassels planted for the use of cloth-workers, since letten\r\nto the cross-bow makers, wherein they used to shoot for games at the\r\npopinjay: now the same being inclosed with a brick wall, serveth to be\r\nan artillery yard, whereunto the gunners of the Tower do weekly repair,\r\nnamely, every Thursday; and there levelling certain brass pieces of\r\ngreat artillery against a butt of earth, made for that purpose, they\r\ndischarge them for their exercise.\r\n\r\nThen have you the late dissolved priory and hospital,[152] commonly\r\ncalled St. Mary Spittle, founded by Walter Brune and Rosia his wife,\r\nfor canons regular. Walter, archdeacon of London, laid the first\r\nstone in the year 1197, William, of St. Mary church, then bishop of\r\nLondon, dedicated to the honour of Jesus Christ and his mother, the\r\nperpetual Virgin Mary, by the name of _Domus Dei_, and _Beatæ Mariæ_,\r\nextra Bishopsgate, in the parish of St. Buttolph; the bounds whereof,\r\nas appeareth by composition betwixt the parson and prior of the\r\nsaid hospital concerning tithes, beginneth at Berward’s lane toward\r\nthe south, and extendeth in breadth to the parish of St. Leonard of\r\nShoreditch towards the north; and in length, from the King’s street\r\non the west to the bishop of London’s field, called Lollesworth, on\r\nthe east. The prior of this St. Mary Spittle, for the emortising\r\nand propriation of Bikenacar, in Essex, to his said house of St.\r\nMary Spittle, gave to Henry VII. £400 in the 22nd of his reign. This\r\nhospital, surrendered to Henry VIII., was valued to dispend £478;\r\nwherein was found, besides ornaments of the church, and other goods\r\npertaining to the hospital, one hundred and eighty beds, well furnished,\r\nfor receipt of the poor; for it was an hospital of great relief. Sir\r\nHenry Plesington, knight, was buried there 1452.\r\n\r\nIn place of this hospital, and near adjoining, are now many fair houses\r\nbuilt for receipt and lodging of worshipful persons. A part of the large\r\nchurchyard pertaining to this hospital, and severed from the rest with a\r\nbrick wall, yet remaineth as of old time, with a pulpit cross therein,\r\nsomewhat like to that in Paules churchyard. And against the said pulpit\r\non the south side, before the charnel and chapel of St. Edmond the\r\nBishop and Mary Magdalen, which chapel was founded about the year 1391\r\nby William Eneshan, citizen and paperer of London, who was there buried,\r\nremaineth also one fair built house, of two stories in height, for the\r\nmayor and other honourable persons, with the aldermen and sheriffs to\r\nsit in, there to hear the sermons preached in the Easter holidays. In\r\nthe loft over them stood the bishop of London, and other prelates; now\r\nthe ladies and aldermen’s wives do there stand at a fair window, or sit\r\nat their pleasure. And here is to be noted, that, time out of mind, it\r\nhath been a laudable custom, that on Good Friday, in the afternoon, some\r\nespecial learned man, by appointment of the prelates, hath preached a\r\nsermon at Paules cross, treating of Christ’s Passion; and upon the three\r\nnext Easter holidays, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, the like learned\r\nmen, by the like appointment, have used to preach on the forenoons at\r\nthe said Spittle, to persuade the article of Christ’s Resurrection;\r\nand then on Low Sunday, one other learned man at Paules cross, to\r\nmake rehearsal of those four former sermons, either commending or\r\nreproving them, as to him by judgment of the learned divines was thought\r\nconvenient. And that done, he was to make a sermon of his own study,\r\nwhich in all were five sermons in one. At these sermons, so severally\r\npreached, the mayor, with his brethren the aldermen, were accustomed\r\nto be present in their violets at Paules on Good Friday, and in their\r\nscarlets at the Spittle in the holidays, except Wednesday in violet, and\r\nthe mayor with his brethren on Low Sunday in scarlet, at Paules cross,\r\ncontinued until this day.\r\n\r\nTouching the antiquity of this custom, I find, that in the year 1398,\r\nKing Richard having procured from Rome confirmation of such statutes\r\nand ordinances as were made in the parliament, begun at Westminster and\r\nended at Shrewsbury, he caused the same confirmation to be read and\r\npronounced at Paules cross, and at St. Mary Spittle, in the sermons\r\nbefore all the people. Philip Malpas, one of the sheriffs in the year\r\n1439, gave twenty shillings by the year to the three preachers at the\r\nSpittle. Stephen Forster, mayor in the year 1454, gave forty pounds\r\nto the preachers at Paules cross and Spittle. I find also that the\r\naforesaid house, wherein the mayor and aldermen do sit at the Spittle,\r\nwas built for that purpose of the goods and by the executors of Richard\r\nLawson, alderman, and Isabell his wife, in the year 1488. In the year\r\n1594, this pulpit being old was taken down, and a new set up; the\r\npreacher’s face turned towards the south, which was before toward the\r\nwest; also a large house, on the east side of the said pulpit, was then\r\nbuilt for the governors and children of Christ’s hospital to sit in, and\r\nthis was done of the goods of William Elkens, alderman, late deceased;\r\nbut within the first year the same house decaying, and like to have\r\nfallen, was again with great cost repaired at the city’s charge.\r\n\r\nOn the east side of this churchyard lieth a large field, of old time\r\ncalled Lolesworth, now Spittle field; which about the year 1576 was\r\nbroken up for clay to make brick; in the digging whereof many earthen\r\npots, called _urnæ_, were found full of ashes, and burnt bones of men,\r\nto wit, of the Romans that inhabited here; for it was the custom of the\r\nRomans to burn their dead, to put their ashes in an urn, and then bury\r\nthe same, with certain ceremonies, in some field appointed for that\r\npurpose near unto their city. Every of these pots had in them with the\r\nashes of the dead one piece of copper money, with the inscription of the\r\nemperor then reigning: some of them were of Claudius, some of Vespasian,\r\nsome of Nero, of Anthoninus Pius, of Trajanus, and others. Besides those\r\nurns, many other pots were there found, made of a white earth with\r\nlong necks and handles, like to our stone jugs: these were empty, but\r\nseemed to be buried full of some liquid matter long since consumed and\r\nsoked through; for there were found divers phials and other fashioned\r\nglasses, some most cunningly wrought, such as I have not seen the like,\r\nand some of crystal; all which had water in them, nothing differing in\r\nclearness, taste, or savour from common spring water, whatsoever it was\r\nat the first: some of these glasses had oil in them very thick, and\r\nearthy in savour; some were supposed to have balm in them, but had lost\r\nthe virtue; many of those pots and glasses were broken in cutting of\r\nthe clay, so that few were taken up whole. There were also found divers\r\ndishes and cups of a fine red-coloured earth, which showed outwardly\r\nsuch a shining smoothness as if they had been of coral; those had in the\r\nbottoms Roman letters printed: there were also lamps of white earth and\r\nred, artificially wrought with divers antiques about them, some three\r\nor four images made of white earth, about a span long each of them: one\r\nI remember was of Pallas, the rest I have forgotten. I myself have\r\nreserved, among divers of those antiquities there, one urn, with the\r\nashes and bones, and one pot of white earth very small, not exceeding\r\nthe quantity of a quarter of a wine pint, made in shape of a hare\r\nsquatted upon her legs, and between her ears is the mouth of the pot.\r\nThere hath also been found in the same field divers coffins of stone,\r\ncontaining the bones of men: these I suppose to be the burials of some\r\nespecial persons in time of the Britons or Saxons, after that the Romans\r\nhad left to govern here. Moreover, there were also found the skulls and\r\nbones of men without coffins, or rather whose coffins (being of great\r\ntimber) were consumed. Divers great nails of iron were there found,\r\nsuch as are used in the wheels of shod carts, being each of them as big\r\nas a man’s finger, and a quarter of a yard long, the heads two inches\r\nover; those nails were more wondered at than the rest of things there\r\nfound, and many opinions of men were there uttered of them; namely,\r\nthat the men there buried were murdered by driving those nails into\r\ntheir heads; a thing unlikely, for a smaller nail would more aptly serve\r\nto so bad a purpose, and a more secret place would likely be employed\r\nfor their burial. But to set down what I have observed concerning this\r\nmatter, I there beheld the bones of a man lying (as I noted), the head\r\nnorth, the feet south, and round about him, as thwart his head, along\r\nboth his sides, and thwart his feet, such nails were found, wherefore I\r\nconceived them to be the nails of his coffin, which had been a trough\r\ncut out of some great tree, and the same covered with a plank, of a\r\ngreat thickness, fastened with such nails; and therefore I caused some\r\nof the nails to be reached up to me, and found under the broad heads of\r\nthem the old wood, skant turned into earth, but still retaining both\r\nthe grain and proper colour: of these nails, with the wood under the\r\nhead thereof, I reserved one, as also the nether jaw-bone of the man,\r\nthe teeth being great, sound, and fast fixed, which, among other many\r\nmonuments there found, I have yet to show; but the nail lying dry, is\r\nby scaling greatly wasted. And thus much for this part of Bishopsgate\r\nward, without the gate; for I have in another place spoken of the gate,\r\nand therefore I am to speak of that other part of this ward which lieth\r\nwithin the gate.\r\n\r\nAnd first to begin on the left hand of Bishopsgate street, from the gate\r\nyou have certain tenements of old time pertaining to a brotherhood of\r\nSt. Nicholas, granted to the parish clerks of London, for two chaplains,\r\nto be kept in the chapel of St. Mary Magdalen, near unto the Guildhall\r\nof London, in the 27th of Henry VI. The first of these houses towards\r\nthe north, and against the wall of the city, was sometime a large inn\r\nor court called the Wrestlers, of such a sign, and the last in the high\r\nstreet towards the south was sometime also a fair inn called the Angel,\r\nof such a sign. Among these said tenements was on the same street side\r\na fair entry, or court, to the common hall of the said parish clerks,\r\nwith proper alms houses, seven in number, adjoining, for poor parish\r\nclerks, and their wives and their widows, such as were in great years\r\nnot able to labour. One of these, by the said brotherhood of parish\r\nclerks, was allowed sixteen pence the week; the other six had each of\r\nthem nine pence the week, according to the patent thereof granted. This\r\nbrotherhood, amongst other, being suppressed, in the reign of Edward\r\nVI. the said hall, with the other buildings there, was given to Sir\r\nRobert Chester, a knight of Cambridgeshire; against whom the parish\r\nclerks commencing suit, in the reign of Queen Mary, and being like to\r\nhave prevailed, the said Sir Robert Chester pulled down the hall, sold\r\nthe timber, stone, and lead, and thereupon the suit was ended. The alms\r\nhouses remain in the queen’s hands, and people are there placed, such as\r\ncan make best friends; some of them, taking the pension appointed, have\r\nlet forth their houses for great rent, giving occasion to the parson of\r\nthe parish to challenge tithes of the poor, etc.\r\n\r\nNext unto this is the small parish church of St. Ethelburge Virgin,\r\nand from thence some small distance is a large court called Little St.\r\nHelen’s, because it pertained to the nuns of St. Helen’s, and was their\r\nhouse: there are seven alms rooms or houses for the poor, belonging to\r\nthe company of Leathersellers. Then, somewhat more west, is another\r\ncourt with a winding lane, which cometh out against the west end of\r\nSt. Andrew Undershaft church. In this court standeth the church of St.\r\nHelen, sometime a priory of black nuns, and in the same a parish church\r\nof St. Helen.\r\n\r\nThis priory was founded before the reign of Henry III. William Basing,\r\ndean of Paules, was the first founder, and was there buried; and William\r\nBasing, one of the sheriffs of London, in the 2nd year of Edward II. was\r\nholden also to be a founder, or rather a helper there. This priory being\r\nvalued at £314 2_s._ 6_d._ was surrendered the 25th of November, the\r\n30th of Henry VIII.; the whole church, the partition betwixt the nuns’\r\nchurch and parish church being taken down, remaineth now to the parish,\r\nand is a fair parish church, but wanteth such a steeple as Sir Thomas\r\nGresham promised to have built, in recompense of ground in their church\r\nfilled up with his monument. The nuns’ hall, and other houses thereunto\r\nappertaining, was since purchased by the company of the Leathersellers,\r\nand is their common hall; which company was incorporate in the 21st year\r\nof Richard II.\r\n\r\nIn the church of St. Helen have you these monuments of the dead:--Thomas\r\nLangton, chaplain, buried in the choir 1350; Adam Frances, mayor, 1354;\r\nElizabeth Vennar, wife to William Vennar, alderman, one of the sheriffs\r\nof London, 1401; Joan, daughter to Henry Seamer, wife to Richard, son\r\nand heir to Robert Lord Poynings, died a virgin 1420; John Swinflat,\r\n1420; Nicholas Marshall, ironmonger, alderman, 1474; Sir John Crosby,\r\nalderman, 1475, and Ann his wife; Thomas Williams, gentleman, 1495;\r\nJoan Cocken, wife to John Cocken, esquire, 1509; Marie Orrell, wife\r\nto Sir Lewes Orrell, knight; Henry Sommer, and Katherine his wife;\r\nWalter Huntington, esquire; John Langthorpe, esquire, 1510; John Gower,\r\nsteward of St. Helen’s, 1512; Robert Rochester, esquire, sergeant of the\r\npantry to Henry VIII.; Sir William Sanctlo, and Sir William Sanctlo,\r\nfather and son; Eleanor, daughter to Sir Thomas Butler; Lord Sudley;\r\nJohn Southworth; Nicholas Harpsfield, esquire; Thomas Sanderford,\r\nor Sommerford, alderman; Alexander Cheyney; Walter Dawbeney; George\r\nFastolph, son to Hugh Fastolph; Robert Liade; Thomas Benolt, alias\r\nClarenciaulx, king at arms, 1534; William Hollis, mayor, 1540; John\r\nFauconbridge, esquire, 1545; Hacket, gentleman of the king’s chapel;\r\nSir Andrew Jud, mayor, 1551; Sir William Pickering, and Sir William\r\nPickering, father and son; William Bond, alderman, 1567; Sir Thomas\r\nGresham, mercer, 1579; William Skegges, sergeant poulter; Richard\r\nGresham, son to Sir Thomas Gresham, 1564.\r\n\r\nThen have you one great house called Crosby place, because the same\r\nwas built by Sir John Crosby, grocer and woolman, in place of certain\r\ntenements, with their appurtenances, letten to him by Alice Ashfed,\r\nprioress of St. Helen’s, and the convent for ninety-nine years, from the\r\nyear 1466 unto the year 1565, for the annual rent of £11 6_s._ 8_d._\r\nThis house he built of stone and timber, very large and beautiful, and\r\nthe highest at that time in London. He was one of the sheriffs, and an\r\nalderman in the year 1470, knighted by Edward IV. in the year 1471, and\r\ndeceased in the year 1475; so short a time enjoyed he that his large and\r\nsumptuous building; he was buried in St. Helen’s, the parish church; a\r\nfair monument of him and his lady is raised there. He gave towards the\r\nreforming of that church five hundred marks, which was bestowed with\r\nthe better, as appeareth by his arms, both in the stone work, roof of\r\ntimber, and glazing. I hold it a fable said of him to be named Crosbie,\r\nof being found by a cross, for I have read of other to have that name\r\nof Crosbie before him; namely, in the year 1406, the 7th of Henry IV.,\r\nthe said king gave to his servant John Crosbie the wardship of Joan,\r\ndaughter and sole heir to John Jordaine, fishmonger, etc. This Crosbie\r\nmight be the father or grandfather to Sir John Crosbie.\r\n\r\nRichard, Duke of Gloucester, and lord protector, afterward king, by\r\nthe name of Richard III., was lodged in this house; since the which\r\ntime, among other, Anthonie Bonvice, a rich merchant of Italy, dwelt\r\nthere; after him, Germain Cioll, then William Bond, alderman, increased\r\nthis house in height, with building of a turret on the top thereof: he\r\ndeceased in the year 1576, and was buried in St. Helen’s church. Divers\r\nambassadors have been lodged there; namely, in the year 1586, Henry\r\nRamelius, chancellor of Denmark, ambassador unto the queen’s majesty\r\nof England from Frederick II., the king of Denmark; an ambassador of\r\nFrance, etc. Sir John Spencer, alderman, lately purchased this house,\r\nmade great reparations, kept his mayoralty there, and since built a most\r\nlarge warehouse near thereunto.\r\n\r\nFrom this Crosbie place up to Leaden hall corner, and so down Grass\r\nstreet, amongst other tenements, are divers fair and large built houses\r\nfor merchants, and such like.\r\n\r\nNow for the other side of this ward, namely, the right hand, hard by\r\nwithin the gate, is one fair water conduit, which Thomas Knesworth,\r\nmayor, in the year 1505, founded: he gave £60, the rest was furnished\r\nat the common charges of the city. This conduit hath since been taken\r\ndown and new built. David Woodrooffe, alderman, gave £20 towards the\r\nconveyance of more water thereunto. From this conduit have you, amongst\r\nmany fair tenements, divers fair inns, large for receipt of travellers,\r\nand some houses for men of worship; namely, one most spacious of all\r\nother thereabout, built of brick and timber by Sir Thomas Gresham,\r\nknight, who deceased in the year 1579, and was buried in St. Helen’s\r\nchurch, under a fair monument, by him prepared in his life: he appointed\r\nby his testament this house to be made a college of readers, as before\r\nis said in the chapter of schools and houses of learning.\r\n\r\nSomewhat west from this house is one other very fair house, wherein\r\nSir William Hollies kept his mayoralty, and was buried in the parish\r\nchurch of St. Helen. Sir Andrew Jud also kept his mayoralty there, and\r\nwas buried at St. Helen’s: he built alms houses for six poor alms people\r\nnear to the said parish church, and gave lands to the Skinners, out of\r\nthe which they are to give 4_s._ every week to the six poor alms people,\r\n8_d._ the piece, and 25_s._ 4_d._ the year, in coals amongst them for\r\never.\r\n\r\nAlice Smith, of London, widow, late wife of Thomas Smith, of the same\r\ncity, esquire, and customer of the port of London, in her last will\r\nand testament, bequeathed lands to the value of £15 by the year for\r\never, to the company of Skinners, for the augmenting of the pensions\r\nof certain poor, inhabiting in eight alms houses, erected by Sir\r\nAndrew Jud, knight, her father, in the parish of Great St. Helen’s, in\r\nBishopsgate street, in London. She hath also given in her said last will\r\nand testament, in other charitable uses, as to the hospitals and to the\r\npoor of other parishes and good preachers, the sum of £300. As also to\r\nthe poor scholars in the two universities of Oxford and Cambridge the\r\nsum of £200; of which, her last will and testament, she made her sons,\r\nThomas Smith, late sheriff of London, and Richard and Robert Smith,\r\nher executors, who have performed the same according to her godly and\r\ncharitable mind.\r\n\r\nThen in the very west corner, over against the east end of St. Martin’s\r\nOteswich (from whence the street windeth towards the south), you had of\r\nold time a fair well, with two buckets, so fastened that the drawing up\r\nof the one let down the other; but now of late that well is turned into\r\na pump.\r\n\r\nFrom this to the corner over against the Leaden hall, and so down Grasse\r\nstreet, are many fair houses for merchants and artificers, and many fair\r\ninns for travellers, even to the corner where that ward endeth, over\r\nagainst Grasse street. And thus much for this Bishopsgate ward shall\r\nsuffice; which hath an alderman, two deputies, one without the gate,\r\nanother within, common councillors six, constables seven, scavengers\r\nseven, for wardmote inquest thirteen, and a beadle: it is taxed to the\r\nfifteen at £13.[153]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[151] “To Master Cornewallos.”--_1st edition_, p. 128.\r\n\r\n[152] “Of our blessed lady.”--_1st edition_, p. 129.\r\n\r\n[153] “At twenty-two pounds in London, and in the Exchequer twenty-one\r\npounds ten shillings.”--_1st edition_, p. 136.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBROAD STREET WARD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next is Brode street ward, which beginneth within Bishopsgate,\r\nfrom the water conduit westward on both sides of the street, by\r\nAllhallows church, to an iron grate on the channel which runneth into\r\nthe water-course of Walbrooke, before you come to the postern called\r\nMooregate; and this is the farthest west part of that ward.\r\n\r\nThen have you Brode street, whereof the ward taketh name, which\r\nstretcheth out of the former street from the east corner of Allhallows\r\nchurchyard, somewhat south to the parish church of St. Peter the Poor\r\non both sides, and then by the south gate of the Augustine friars west,\r\ndown Throkmorton street by the Drapers’ hall into Lothburie, to another\r\ngrate of iron over the channel there, whereby the water runneth into\r\nthe course of Walbrook, under the east end of St. Margaret’s church,\r\ncertain posts of timber are there set up; and this is also the farthest\r\nwest part of this ward, in the said street. Out of the which street\r\nrunneth up Bartholomew lane south to the north side of the Exchange;\r\nthen more east, out of the former street from over against the Friars\r\nAugustine’s church south gate, runneth up another part of Brode street\r\nsouth to a pump over against St. Bennet’s church. Then have you one\r\nother street called Three needle street, beginning at the west, with\r\ntwo buckets, by St. Martin’s Oteswich church wall. This street runneth\r\ndown on both sides to Finkes lane, and half way up that lane to a gate\r\nof a merchant’s house on the west side, but not so far on the east; then\r\nthe foresaid street, from this Finkes lane, runneth down by the Royal\r\nExchange to the Stocks, and to a place formerly called Scalding house,\r\nor Scalding wick, but now Scalding alley; by the west side whereof,\r\nunder the parish church of St. Mildred, runneth the course of Walbrooke;\r\nand these be the bounds of this ward.\r\n\r\nSpecial monuments therein are these:--First, the parish church of\r\nAllhallows in the wall, so called of standing close to the wall of the\r\ncity, in which have been buried Thomas Durrem, esquire, and Margaret his\r\nwife; Robert Beele, esquire, 1601. On the other side of that street,\r\namongst many proper houses possessed for the most part by curriers, is\r\nthe Carpenters’ hall, which company was incorporated in the 17th year of\r\nKing Edward IV.\r\n\r\nThen east from the Currier’s row is a long and high wall of stone,\r\ninclosing the north side of a large garden adjoining to as large an\r\nhouse, built in the reign of King Henry VIII. and of Edward VI. by Sir\r\nWilliam Powlet, lord treasurer of England. Through this garden, which\r\nof old time consisted of divers parts, now united, was sometimes a\r\nfair footway, leading by the west end of the Augustine friars church\r\nstraight north, and opened somewhat west from Allhallows church against\r\nLondon wall towards Moregate; which footway had gates at either end,\r\nlocked up every night; but now the same way being taken into those\r\ngardens, the gates are closed up with stone, whereby the people are\r\nforced to go about by St. Peter’s church, and the east end of the said\r\nFriars church, and all the said great place and garden of Sir William\r\nPowlet to London wall, and so to Moregate.\r\n\r\nThis great house, adjoining to the garden aforesaid, stretcheth to the\r\nnorth corner of Brode street, and then turneth up Brode street all that\r\nside to and beyond the east end of the said Friars church. It was built\r\nby the said lord treasurer in place of Augustine friars house, cloister,\r\nand gardens, etc. The Friars church he pulled not down, but the west\r\nend thereof, inclosed from the steeple and choir, was in the year 1550\r\ngranted to the Dutch nation in London, to be their preaching place: the\r\nother part, namely, the steeple, choir, and side aisles to the choir\r\nadjoining, he reserved to household uses, as for stowage of corn, coal,\r\nand other things; his son and heir, Marquis of Winchester, sold the\r\nmonuments of noblemen there buried in great number, the paving-stone\r\nand whatsoever (which cost many thousands), for one hundred pounds,\r\nand in place thereof made fair stabling for horses. He caused the lead\r\nto be taken from the roofs, and laid tile in place whereof; which\r\nexchange proved not so profitable as he looked for, but rather to his\r\ndisadvantage.\r\n\r\nOn the east side of this Brode street, amongst other buildings, on the\r\nback part of Gresham house, which is in Bishopsgate street, he placed\r\neight proper alms houses, built of brick and timber by Sir Thomas\r\nGresham, knight, for eight alms men, which he now there placed rent\r\nfree, and receive each of them by his gift £6 13_s._ 4_d._ yearly for\r\never.\r\n\r\nNext unto Pawlet house is the parish church of St. Peter the Poor, so\r\ncalled for a difference from other of that name, sometime peradventure a\r\npoor parish, but at this present there be many fair houses, possessed by\r\nrich merchants and other. Buried in this church: Richard Fitzwilliams,\r\nmerchant-tailor, 1520; Sir William Roch, mayor, 1540; Martin Calthrope,\r\nmayor, 1588.\r\n\r\nThen next have you the Augustine Friars church and churchyard; the\r\nentering thereunto by a south gate to the west porch, a large church,\r\nhaving a most fine spired steeple, small, high, and straight, I have not\r\nseen the like: founded by Humfrey Bohun, Earl of Hereford and Essex,\r\nin the year 1253. Reginald Cobham gave his messuage in London to the\r\nenlarging thereof, in the year 1344. Humfrey Bohun, Earl of Hereford\r\nand Essex, re-edified this church in the year 1354, whose body was\r\nthere buried in the choir. The small spired steeple of this church was\r\noverthrown by a tempest of wind in the year 1362, but was raised of\r\nnew, as now it standeth, to the beautifying of the city. This house was\r\nvalued at £57, and was surrendered the 12th of November, the 30th of\r\nHenry VIII.\r\n\r\nThere lie buried in this Friars church, amongst others, Edward, first\r\nson to Joan, mother to King Richard II.; Guy de Mericke, Earl of St.\r\nPaule; Lucie, Countess of Kent, and one of the heirs of Barnabie Lord\r\nof Millaine, with an epitaph; Dame Ide, wife to Sir Thomas West; Dame\r\nMargaret West; Stephen Lindericle, esquire; Sir Humfrey Bohun, Earl of\r\nHereford and Essex, Lord of Brekenake;[154] Richard, the great Earl of\r\nArundell, Surrey, and Warren, beheaded, 1397; Sir Edward Arundell, and\r\nDame Elizabeth his wife; Sir Francis Atcourt,[155] Earl of Pembrooke,\r\nwhich married Alice, sister to the Earl of Oxford; Dame Lucie Knowles,\r\nof Kent; Sir Peter Garinsers, of France; the Lord John Vere, Earl of\r\nOxford, beheaded on the Tower hill 1463; Aubrey de Vere, son and heir\r\nto the Earl of Oxford; Sir Thomas Tudnam, knight; William Bourser; Lord\r\nFitz Warren; Sir Thomas de la Lande, knight; Dame Joan Norris, the Lady\r\nof Bedforde; Anne, daughter to John Viscount Welles; Walter Nevell,\r\nesquire; Sir John Manners, knight; the wife of Sir David Cradocke,\r\nknight; the mother to the Lord Spencer’s wife; Sir Bartlemew Rodlegate;\r\nJohn, son to Sir John Wingfield; Sir Walter Mewes; Robert Newenton,\r\nesquire; Philip Spencer, son to Sir Hugh Spencer; Dame Isabell, daughter\r\nto Sir Hugh; the Lord Barons slain at Barnet field, buried there 1471.\r\nIn the body of the church: Dame Julian, wife to Sir Richard Lacie;\r\nSir Thomas Courtney, son to the Earl of Devonshire, and by him, his\r\nsister, wedded to Cheverstone; the daughter of the Lord Beaumont; two\r\nsons of Sir Thomas Morley, to wit, William and Ralph; Sir William\r\nTalmage, knight; Nicholas Blondell, esquire; Sir Richard Chamberlaine;\r\nJohn Halton, gentleman; Sir John Gifford, knight; Thomas Manningham,\r\nesquire; Sir William Kenude, knight; Sir William, son to Sir Thomas\r\nTerill; John Surell, gentleman. In the east wing: Margaret Barentin,\r\ngentlewoman; John Spicer, esquire, and Letis his wife; John le Percers,\r\nesquire; Roger Chibary, esquire; Peter Morens, esquire; Thomas, son to\r\nSir William Beckland; James Cuthing, esquire; John Chorner, esquire;\r\nWilliam Kenley, esquire; Margery, wife to Thomas Band, and daughter\r\nto John Hutch; the Lord William, Marquis of Barkeley and Earl of\r\nNottingham, and Dame Joan his wife. In the west wing: Sir John Tirrill,\r\nand Dame Katherine his wife; Sir Walter of Powle, knight; Sir John\r\nBlanckwell, and his wife Dame Jane Sayne, daughter to Sir John Lee; Sir\r\nJohn Dawbeney, son and heir to Sir Giles Dawbeney; William, son to Sir\r\nRoger Scroope; Dame Joan Dawbeney, wife to Sir William Dawbeney; Thomas\r\nCharles, esquire; Sir John Dawbeney, knight, and his son Robert; Sir\r\nJames Bell, knight; Sir Oliver Manny, knight; Henry Deskie, esquire; Sir\r\nDiones Mordaske; Sir Bernard Rolingcort; Sir Peter Kayor; Sir William\r\nTirell; Sir William, his brother knights; William Collingborne, esquire,\r\nbeheaded 1484; Sir Roger Clifford, knight; Sir Thomas Coke, mayor in\r\nthe year 1462; William Edward, mayor, 1471; Sir James Tirell, Sir\r\nJohn Windany, knights, beheaded 1502; Sir John Dawtrie, knight, 1519;\r\nDame Margaret Rede, 1510; Edward, Duke of Buckingham, beheaded 1521;\r\nGwiskard, Earl of Huntington.\r\n\r\nOn the south side, and at the west end of this church, many fair houses\r\nare built; namely, in Throgmorton street, one very large and spacious,\r\nbuilt in the place of old and small tenements by Thomas Cromwell, master\r\nof the king’s jewel-house, after that master of the rolls, then Lord\r\nCromwell, knight, lord privy seal, vicar-general, Earl of Essex, high\r\nchamberlain of England, etc. This house being finished, and having\r\nsome reasonable plot of ground left for a garden, he caused the pales\r\nof the gardens adjoining to the north part thereof on a sudden to be\r\ntaken down; twenty-two feet to be measured forth right into the north\r\nof every man’s ground; a line there to be drawn, a trench to be cast,\r\na foundation laid, and a high brick wall to be built. My father had a\r\ngarden there, and a house standing close to his south pale; this house\r\nthey loosed from the ground, and bare upon rollers into my father’s\r\ngarden twenty-two feet, ere my father heard thereof; no warning was\r\ngiven him, nor other answer, when he spake to the surveyors of that\r\nwork, but that their master Sir Thomas commanded them so to do; no man\r\ndurst go to argue the matter, but each man lost his land, and my father\r\npaid his whole rent, which was 6_s._ 6_d._ the year, for that half\r\nwhich was left. Thus much of mine own knowledge have I thought good to\r\nnote, that the sudden rising of some men causeth them[156] to forget\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe company of the Drapers in London bought this house, and now the\r\nsame is their common hall. This company obtained of King Henry VI., in\r\nthe 17th of his reign, to be incorporate: John Gidney was chosen to be\r\ntheir first master, and the four wardens were, J. Wotton, J. Darbie,\r\nRobert Breton, and T. Cooke. The arms granted to the said company by\r\nSir William Bridges, knight, first garter king at arms, in blason, are\r\nthus: Three sunbeams issuing out of three clouds of flame, crowned with\r\nthree crowns imperial of gold, upon a shield azure. From this hall, on\r\nthe same side down to the grates and course of Walbrook, have ye divers\r\nfair houses for merchants and other; from the which grates back again\r\non the other side in Lethbury, so called in record of Edward III., the\r\n38th year, and now corruptly called Lothbury, are candlestick founders\r\nplaced, till ye come to Bartholomew lane, so called of St. Bartholomew’s\r\nchurch, at the south-east corner thereof. In this lane also are divers\r\nfair built houses on both sides, and so likewise have ye in the other\r\nstreet, which stretcheth from the Friars Augustine’s south gate to the\r\ncorner over against St. Bennet’s church. In this street, amongst other\r\nfair buildings, the most ancient was of old time a house pertaining to\r\nthe abbot of St. Albans; John Catcher, alderman, now dwelleth there;\r\nthen is the free school pertaining to the late dissolved hospital of\r\nSt. Anthony, whereof more shall be shown in another place, and so up to\r\nThreeneedle street. On the south part of which street, beginning at the\r\neast, by the well with two buckets, now turned to a pump, is the parish\r\nchurch of St. Martin called Oteswich, of Martin de Oteswich, Nicholas\r\nde Oteswich, William Oteswich, and John Oteswich, founders thereof.\r\nThere be monuments in this church of William Constantine, alderman,\r\nand Emme his wife; Katherine, wife to Benedick Augustine; Sir William\r\nDrifield, knight; John Oteswich, and his wife, under a fair monument\r\non the south side; John Churchman, one of the sheriffs, in the year\r\n1385; Richard Naylor, tailor, alderman, 1483; James Falleron; John\r\nMelchborne; Thomas Hey, and Hellis his wife; William Clitherow, and\r\nMargaret his wife; Oliver and William, sons to John Woodroffe, esquire;\r\nHugh Pemberton, tailor, alderman, 1500, and Katherine his wife; Matthew\r\nPemberton, merchant-tailor, about 1514: he gave £50 to the repairing\r\nof St. Lawrence chapel. The aforesaid John Churchman, for William and\r\nJohn Oteswich, by license of Henry IV., the 6th of his reign, gave the\r\nadvowson or patronage of this church, four messuages, and seventeen\r\nshops, with the appurtenances in the parish of St. Martin’s Oteswich,\r\netc., to the master and wardens of tailors and linen-armourers, keepers\r\nof the guild and fraternity of St. John Baptist in London, and to their\r\nsuccessors, in perpetual alms, to be employed on the poor brethren and\r\nsisters; whereupon, adjoining unto the west end of this parish church,\r\nthe said master and wardens built about a proper quadrant or squared\r\ncourt, seven alms houses, wherein they placed seven alms men of that\r\ncompany, and their wives (if they had wives); each of these seven of\r\nold time had 13_d._ the week, but now of later time their stipend by\r\nthe said master and wardens hath been augmented to the sum of 26_s._\r\nthe quarter, which is £5 4_s._ the year to each of them, besides coals;\r\nmore, to each of them 20_s._ the year, by gift of Walter Fish, sometime\r\nmaster of that company, and tailor to her majesty.\r\n\r\nSome small distance from thence is the Merchant-tailors’-hall,\r\npertaining to the guild and fraternity of St. John Baptist, time out of\r\nmind called of tailors and linen-armourers of London; for I find that\r\nEdward I., in the 28th of his reign, confirmed this guild by the name\r\nof Tailors and Linen-armourers, and also gave to the brethren thereof\r\nauthority every year at Midsummer to hold a feast, and to choose unto\r\nthem a governor, or master, with wardens; whereupon the same year, 1300,\r\non the feast day of the nativity of St. John Baptist, they chose Henry\r\nde Ryall to be their pilgrim for the master of this mystery (as one that\r\ntravelled for the whole company was then so called) until the 11th of\r\nRichard II.; and the four wardens were then called purveyors of alms\r\n(now called quarterage) of the said fraternity. This merchant-tailors’\r\nhall, sometime pertaining to a worshipful gentleman named Edmond Creping\r\n(Dominus Creping after some record), he in the year of Christ 1331, the\r\nfirst of Edward III., for a certain sum of money to him paid, made his\r\ngrant thereof by the name of his principal messuage in the wards of\r\nCornehill and Brode street, which Sir Oliver Ingham, knight, did then\r\nhold, to John of Yakley, the king’s pavilion maker. This was called the\r\nnew hall, or tailors’ inn, for a difference from their old hall, which\r\nwas about the back side of the Red Lion in Basing lane, and in the ward\r\nof Cordwayner street.\r\n\r\nThe 21st of Edward IV., Thomas Holme, _alias_ Clarenciaulx king\r\nof arms for the south part of England, granted by his patents to\r\nthe said fraternity and guild of St. John Baptist, of tailors and\r\nlinen-armourers, to bear in a field silver, a pavilion between two\r\nmantels imperial purple garnished with gold, in a chief azure and holy\r\nLamb, set within a sun, the crest upon the helm, a pavilion purple\r\ngarnished with gold, etc. After this King Henry VII. being himself a\r\nbrother of this fraternity or guild of St. John Baptist, of tailors or\r\nlinen-armourers (as divers other his predecessors kings before him had\r\nbeen, to wit, Richard III., Edward IV., Henry V., Henry IV., and Richard\r\nII.); and for that divers of that fraternity had, time out of mind, been\r\ngreat merchants, and had frequented all sorts of merchandises into most\r\nparts of the world, to the honour of the king’s realm, and to the great\r\nprofit of his subjects, and of his progenitors; and the men of the said\r\nmystery, during the time aforesaid, had exercised the buying and selling\r\nof all wares and merchandises, especially of woollen cloth, as well in\r\ngross, as by retail, throughout all this realm of England, and chiefly\r\nwithin the said city; therefore he, of his especial grace, did change,\r\ntransfer, and translate the guild aforesaid, and did incorporate them\r\ninto the name of the Master and Wardens of the Merchant-tailors of the\r\nfraternity of St. John Baptist, in the city of London.\r\n\r\nSome distance west from this the Merchant-tailors’ hall is Finke’s lane,\r\nso called of Robert Finke, and Robert Finke his son, James Finke, and\r\nRosamond Finke. Robert Finke the elder new built the parish church of\r\nSt. Bennet, commonly called Fink, of the founder; his tenements were\r\nboth of St. Bennet’s parish and St. Martin’s Oteswich parish. The one\r\nhalf of this Finke lane is of Brode street ward, to wit, on the west\r\nside up to the great and principal house wherein the said Finke dwelt;\r\nbut on the other side, namely the east, not so much towards Cornhill.\r\nThen without this lane in the aforesaid Threeneedle street is the\r\nsaid parish church of St. Bennet, a proper church, in which are these\r\nmonuments of the dead:--Robert Simson, and Elizabeth his wife; Roger\r\nStrange, esquire; Trerisse; William Coolby; John Frey; Thomas Briar,\r\nplumber, 1410, etc.\r\n\r\nSome distance west is the Royal Exchange, whereof more shall be spoken\r\nin the ward of Cornhill, and so down to the little conduit, called the\r\npissing conduit, by the Stockes market, and this is the south side of\r\nThreeneedle street.\r\n\r\nOn the north side of this street, from over against the east corner\r\nof St. Martin’s Oteswich church, have ye divers fair and large houses\r\ntill ye come to the hospital of St. Anthonie, sometime a cell to St.\r\nAnthonie’s of Vienna. For I read that King Henry III. granted to the\r\nbrotherhood of St. Anthonie of Vienna, a place amongst the Jews, which\r\nwas sometime their synagogue, and had been built by them about the\r\nyear 1231; but the Christians obtained of the king that it should be\r\ndedicated to our Blessed Lady; and since a hospital being there built,\r\nwas called St. Anthonie’s in London; it was founded in the parish of St.\r\nBennet Finke, for a master, two priests, one schoolmaster, and twelve\r\npoor men: after which foundation, amongst other things, was given to\r\nthis hospital, one messuage and garden, whereon was built the fair large\r\nfree school, and one other parcel of ground, containing thirty-seven\r\nfeet in length, and eighteen feet in breadth, whereon was built the\r\nalms houses of hard stone and timber, in the reign of Henry VI., which\r\nsaid Henry VI., in the 20th of his reign, gave unto John Carpenter,\r\nD.D., master of St. Anthonie’s hospital, and to his brethren and their\r\nsuccessors for ever, his manor of Ponington, with the appurtenances,\r\nwith certain pensions and portions of Milburne, Burnworth, Charlton,\r\nand Up Wimborne, in the county of Southampton, towards the maintenance\r\nof five scholars in the university of Oxford, to be brought up in the\r\nfaculty of arts, after the rate of ten pence the week for every scholar,\r\nso that the said scholars shall be first instructed in the rudiments of\r\ngrammar at the college of Eaton, founded by the said king.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1474, Edward IV. granted to William Say, B.D., master of the\r\nsaid hospital, to have priests, clerks, scholars, poor men, and brethren\r\nof the same, clerks, or laymen, choristers, proctors, messengers,\r\nservants in household, and other things whatsoever, like as the prior\r\nand convent of St. Anthonie’s of Vienna, etc. He also annexed, united,\r\nand appropriated the said hospital unto the collegiate church of St.\r\nGeorge in Windsor.\r\n\r\nThe proctors of this house were to collect the benevolence of charitable\r\npersons towards the building and supporting thereof. And amongst other\r\nthings observed in my youth, I remember that the officers charged with\r\noversight of the markets in this city, did divers times take from\r\nthe market people, pigs starved, or otherwise unwholesome for man’s\r\nsustenance; these they slit in the ear. One of the proctors for St.\r\nAnthonie’s tied a bell about the neck, and let it feed on the dunghills;\r\nno man would hurt or take them up, but if any gave to them bread, or\r\nother feeding, such would they know, watch for, and daily follow,\r\nwhining till they had somewhat given them; whereupon was raised a\r\nproverb, “Such an one will follow such an one, and whine as it were an\r\nAnthonie pig;” but if such a pig grew to be fat, and came to good liking\r\n(as oft times they did), then the proctor would take him up to the use\r\nof the hospital.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1499, Sir John Tate, sometime ale-brewer, when a mercer,\r\ncaused his brewhouse, called the Swan, near adjoining to the said free\r\nchapel, college, or hospital of St. Anthonie, to be taken down for the\r\nenlarging of the church, which was then new built, toward the building\r\nwhereof the said Tate gave great sums of money, and finished in the\r\nyear 1501. Sir John Tate deceased 1514, and was there buried under a\r\nfair monument by him prepared. Dr. Tayler, master of the rolls, and\r\nother.[157]\r\n\r\nWalter Champion, draper, one of the sheriffs of London 1529, was buried\r\nthere, and gave to the beadman twenty pounds. The lands by year of this\r\nhospital were valued in the 37th year of Henry VIII. to be fifty-five\r\npounds six shillings and eight pence.\r\n\r\nOne Johnson (a schoolmaster of the famous free-school there) became a\r\nprebend of Windsor, and then by little and little followed the spoil\r\nof this hospital. He first dissolved the choir, conveyed the plate and\r\nornaments, then the bells, and lastly put out the alms men from their\r\nhouses, appointing them portions of twelve pence the week to each (but\r\nnow I hear of no such matter performed), their houses with other be\r\nletten out for rent, and the church is a preaching place for the French\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nThis school was commended in the reign of Henry VI., and sithence\r\ncommended above other, but now decayed, and come to nothing, by taking\r\nthat from it what thereunto belonged.\r\n\r\nNext is the parish church of St. Bartholomew, at the end of Bartholomew\r\nlane. Thomas Pike, alderman, with the assistance of Nicholas Yoo, one\r\nof the sheriffs of London, about the year 1438, new built this church.\r\nSir John Fray, knight, was buried there, Margery his daughter and\r\nheir, wife to Sir John Lepington, knight, founded there a chantry the\r\n21st of Edward IV. Alderban, a Gascoyne, was buried there; Sir Will.\r\nCapel, mayor 1509, added unto this church a proper chapel on the south\r\nside thereof, and was buried there; Sir Giles Cappell was also buried\r\nthere; James Wilford, tailor, one of the sheriffs 1499, appointed by\r\nhis testament a doctor of divinity, every Good Friday for ever, to\r\npreach there a sermon of Christ’s Passion, from six of the clock till\r\neight before noon, in the said church. John Wilford, merchant-tailor,\r\nalderman, 1544; Sir James Wilford, 1550; Sir George Barne, mayor 1552;\r\nJohn Dent; Miles Coverdale, Bishop of Excester; Thomas Dancer, and Anne\r\nhis wife.\r\n\r\nThen lower down towards the Stocks’ market is the parish church of\r\nSt. Christopher, but re-edified of new; for Richard Shore, one of the\r\nsheriffs 1506, gave money towards the building of the steeple. There lie\r\nburied Richard Sherington, 1392, who gave lands to that church; the Lady\r\nMargaret Norford, 1406; John Clavering, 1421, who gave lands thereunto;\r\nJohn Godnay, draper, mayor 1427. This Godnay, in the year 1444, wedded\r\nthe widow of Robert Large, late mayor, which widow had taken the mantle\r\nand ring, and the vow to live chaste to God during the term of her\r\nlife, for the breach whereof, the marriage done, they were troubled\r\nby the church, and put to penance, both he and she. William Hampton,\r\nmayor 1472, was a great benefactor, and glazed some of the church\r\nwindows; Sir William Martin, mayor 1492; Roger Achley, mayor 1511,\r\nhe dwelt in Cornehill ward, in a house belonging to Cobham college,\r\nrented by the year at twenty-six shillings and eight pence; Robert\r\nThorne, merchant-tailor, a bachelor, 1532--he gave by his testament in\r\ncharity more than four thousand four hundred and forty-five pounds; John\r\nNorryholme; Ralph Batte; Alice Percivall; Jane Drew; William Borresbie;\r\nJohn Broke; Richard Sutton; William Batte; James Well; Henry Beacher,\r\nalderman, 1570.\r\n\r\nWest from this church have ye Scalding alley, of old time called\r\nScalding house, or Scalding wike, because that ground for the most part\r\nwas then employed by poulterers that dwelt in the high street from the\r\nStocks’ market to the great conduit. Their poultry, which they sold at\r\ntheir stalls, were scalded there. The street doth yet bear the name of\r\nthe Poultry, and the poulterers are but lately departed from thence into\r\nother streets, as into Grasse street, and the ends of St. Nicholas flesh\r\nshambles. This Scalding wike is the farthest west part of Brode street\r\nward, and is by the water called Walbrook parted from Cheap ward. This\r\nBrode street ward hath an alderman, with his deputy, common councillors\r\nten, constables ten, scavengers eight, wardmote inquest thirteen, and\r\na beadle. It is taxed to the fifteenth in London at seven-and-twenty\r\npounds, and accounted in the Exchequer after twenty-five pounds.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[154] “Pembroke.”--_1st edition_, p. 136.\r\n\r\n[155] “Courtney.”--_1st edition_, _ibid._\r\n\r\n[156] “In some matters.”--_1st edition_, p. 141.\r\n\r\n[157] “This goodly foundation having a free schoole and almes houses\r\nfor poore men (builded of hard stone) adjoyning to the west end of the\r\nchurch, was of olde time confirmed by Henry the Sixt, in the year 1447.\r\nThe outward work of this new church was finished in the year 1501, the\r\nsaid John Tate deceased about the year 1514, and was there buried in a\r\nmonument by him prepared, as appeareth by an indenture tripartite made\r\nbetween the said John Tate, the Deane of Windsor, and William Milbourn,\r\nchamberlaine.”--_1st edition_, p. 145.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORNEHILL WARD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next ward to the south is Cornehill ward, so called of a corn\r\nmarket, time out of mind there holden, and is a part of the principal\r\nhigh street, beginning at the west end of Leaden hall, stretching down\r\nwest on both the sides by the south end of Finks lane on the right hand,\r\nand by the north end of Birchovers lane; on the left part of which\r\nlanes, to wit, to the middle of them, is of this ward, and so down to\r\nthe Stockes market; and this is the bounds.\r\n\r\nThe upper or east part of this ward, and also a part of Lime street\r\nward, hath been (as I said) a market place, especially for corn, and\r\nsince for all kind of victuals, as is partly showed in Lime street\r\nward; yet it appeareth of record, that in the year 1522, the rippers\r\nof Rie and other places, sold their fresh fish in Leaden hall market\r\nupon Cornehill, but foreign butchers were not admitted there to sell\r\nflesh till the year 1533; and it was enacted, that butchers should\r\nsell[158], their beef not above a halfpenny the pound, and mutton a\r\nhalfpenny half-farthing; which act being devised for the great commodity\r\nof the realm (as it was then thought) hath since proved far otherwise;\r\nfor before that time a fat ox was sold in London for six-and-twenty\r\nshillings and eight pence at the most, a fat wether for three shillings\r\nand four pence, a fat calf the like price, a fat lamb for twelve pence,\r\npieces of beef weighing two pounds and a half at the least, yea three\r\npounds or better, for a penny, on every butcher’s stall in this city,\r\nand of those pieces of beef thirteen or fourteen for twelve pence, fat\r\nmutton for eight pence the quarter, and one hundred weight of beef for\r\nfour shillings and eight pence, at the dearest. What the price is now I\r\nneed not to set down; many men thought the same act to rise in price,\r\nby mean that graziers knew or supposed what weight every their beasts\r\ncontained, and so raising their price thereafter, the butcher could\r\nbe no gainer, but by likewise raising his price.[159] The number of\r\nbutchers then in the city and suburbs was accounted six score, of which\r\nevery one killed six oxen a piece weekly, which is in forty-six weeks\r\nthirty-three thousand one hundred and twenty oxen, or seven hundred and\r\ntwenty oxen weekly. The foreign butchers for a long time stood in the\r\nhigh street of Lime Street ward on the north side, twice every week,\r\nnamely, Wednesday and Saturday, and were some gain to the tenants before\r\nwhose doors they stood, and into whose houses they set their blocks and\r\nstalls; but that advantage being espied, they were taken into Leaden\r\nhall, there to pay for their standing to the chamber of London. Thus\r\nmuch for the market upon Cornhill.\r\n\r\nThe chief ornaments on Cornhill ward are these: first, at the east\r\nend thereof, in the middle of the high street, and at the parting\r\nof four ways, have ye a water standard, placed in the year 1582, in\r\nmanner following. A certain German, named Peter Morris, having made an\r\nartificial forcier for that purpose, conveyed Thames water in pipes of\r\nlead over the steeple of St. Magnus church, at the north end of London\r\nBridge, and from thence into divers men’s houses in Thames street, New\r\nFish street, and Grasse street, up to the north-west corner of Leaden\r\nhall, the highest ground of all the city, where the waste of the main\r\npipe rising into this standard, provided at the charges of the city,\r\nwith four spouts did at every tide run (according to covenant) four\r\nways, plentifully serving to the commodity of the inhabitants near\r\nadjoining in their houses, and also cleansed the channels of the street\r\ntowards Bishopsgate, Aldgate, the bridge, and the Stockes’ market. But\r\nnow no such matter, through whose default I know not.[160]\r\n\r\nThen have ye a fair conduit of sweet water, castellated in the middest\r\nof that ward and street. This conduit was first built of stone in\r\nthe year 1282, by Henry Walles, mayor of London, to be a prison for\r\nnight-walkers, and other suspicious persons, and was called the Tun\r\nupon Cornehill, because the same was built somewhat in fashion of a tun\r\nstanding on the one end.\r\n\r\nTo this prison the night watches of this city committed not only night\r\nwalkers, but also other persons, as well spiritual as temporal, whom\r\nthey suspected of incontinence, and punished them according to the\r\ncustoms of this city; but complaint thereof being made, about the year\r\nof Christ 1297, King Edward I. writeth to his citizens thus:--\r\n\r\n“Edward, by the grace of God, etc. Whereas Richard Gravesend, bishop of\r\nLondon, hath showed unto us, that by the Great Charter of England, the\r\nChurch hath a privilege, that no clerk should be imprisoned by a lay\r\nman without our command, and breach of peace, which notwithstanding\r\nsome citizens of London, upon mere spite, do enter in their watches into\r\nclerks’ chambers, and like felons carry them to the Tun, which Henry le\r\nWalleys, sometime mayor, built for night walkers; wherefore we will that\r\nthis our commandment be proclaimed in full hustings, and that no watch\r\nhereafter enter into any clerk’s chamber, under the forfeit of twenty\r\npounds. Dated at Carlisle the 18th of March, the 25th of our reign.”\r\n\r\nMore, I read about the year of Christ 1299, the 27th of Edward I.,\r\ncertain principal citizens of London, to wit, T. Romane, Richard\r\nGloucester, Nicholas Faringdon, Adam Helingburie, T. Saly, John\r\nDunstable, Richard Ashwy, John Wade, and William Stortford, brake up\r\nthis prison called the Tun, and took out certain prisoners, for which\r\nthey were sharply punished by long imprisonment and great fines. It cost\r\nthe citizens (as some have written) more than twenty thousand marks,\r\nwhich they were amerced in, before William le March, treasurer of the\r\nking’s exchequer, to purchase the king’s favour, and confirmation of\r\ntheir liberties.\r\n\r\nAlso, that in the year 1383, the 7th of Richard II., the citizens of\r\nLondon, taking upon them the rights that belonged to their bishops,\r\nfirst imprisoned such women as were taken in fornication or adultery in\r\nthe said Tun, and after bringing them forth to the sight of the world,\r\nthey caused their heads to be shaven, after the manner of thieves, whom\r\nthey named appellators, and so to be led about the city, in sight of\r\nall the inhabitants, with trumpets and pipes sounding before them, that\r\ntheir persons might be the more largely known. Neither did they spare\r\nsuch kind of men a whit the more, but used them as hardly, saying, they\r\nabhorred not only the negligence of their prelates, but also detested\r\ntheir avarice, that studying for money, omitted the punishment limited\r\nby law, and permitted those that were found guilty to live favourably\r\nin their sin. Wherefore, they would themselves, they said, purge their\r\ncity from such filthiness, lest, through God’s vengeance, either the\r\npestilence or sword should happen to them, or that the earth should\r\nswallow them.\r\n\r\nLast of all to be noted, I read in the charge of the wardmote inquest\r\nin every ward of the city, these words:--“If there be any priest in\r\nservice within the ward, which before time hath been set in the Tun in\r\nCornhill for his dishonesty, and hath forsworn the city, all such shall\r\nbe presented.”\r\n\r\nThus much for the Tun in Cornhill have I read. Now for the punishments\r\nof priests in my youth: one note and no more. John Atwod, draper,\r\ndwelling in the parish of St. Michael upon Cornehill, directly against\r\nthe church, having a proper woman to his wife, such an one as seemed the\r\nholiest among a thousand, had also a lusty chantry priest, of the said\r\nparish church, repairing to his house; with the which priest the said\r\nAtwod would sometimes after supper play a game at tables for a pint of\r\nale: it chanced on a time, having haste of work, and his game proving\r\nlong, he left his wife to play it out, and went down to his shop, but\r\nreturning to fetch a pressing iron, he found such play to his misliking,\r\nthat he forced the priest to jump out at a window over the penthouse\r\ninto the street, and so to run to his lodging in the churchyard. Atwod\r\nand his wife were soon reconciled, so that he would not suffer her to\r\nbe called in question; but the priest being apprehended and committed,\r\nI saw his punishment to be thus:--He was on three market days conveyed\r\nthrough the high street and markets of the city with a paper on his\r\nhead, wherein was written his trespass. The first day he rode in a\r\ncarry, the second on a horse, his face to the horse tail, the third led\r\nbetwixt twain, and every day rung with basons, and proclamations made\r\nof his fact at every turning of the street, as also before John Atwod’s\r\nstall, and the church door of his service, where he lost his chantry of\r\ntwenty nobles the year, and was banished the city for ever.\r\n\r\nBy the west side of the foresaid prison, then called the Tun, was a\r\nfair well of spring water, curbed round with hard stone; but in the\r\nyear 1401, the said prison house, called the Tun, was made a cistern\r\nfor sweet water, conveyed by pipes of lead from Tiborne, and was from\r\nthenceforth called the Conduit upon Cornhill. Then was the well planked\r\nover, and a strong prison made of timber called a cage, with a pair\r\nof stocks therein set upon it, and this was for night walkers. On the\r\ntop of which cage was placed a pillory, for the punishment of bakers\r\noffending in the assize of bread, for millers stealing of corn at the\r\nmill, for bawds, scolds, and other offenders. As in the year 1468,\r\nthe 7th of Edward IV., divers persons being common jurors, such as at\r\nassizes were forsworn for rewards, or favour of parties, were judged to\r\nride from Newgate to the pillory in Cornhill, with mitres of paper on\r\ntheir heads, there to stand, and from thence again to Newgate, and this\r\njudgment was given by the mayor of London. In the year 1509, the 1st of\r\nHenry VIII., Darby, Smith, and Simson, ringleaders of false inquests in\r\nLondon, rode about the city with their faces to the horse tails, and\r\npapers on their heads, and were set on the pillory in Cornhill, and\r\nafter brought again to Newgate, where they died for very shame, saith\r\nRobert Fabian. A ringleader of inquests,[161] as I take it, is he that\r\nmaking a gainful occupation thereof, will appear on Nisi-priuses, or he\r\nbe warned, or procure himself to be warned, to come on by a tales. He\r\nwill also procure himself to be foreman when he can, and take upon him\r\nto overrule the rest to his opinion; such an one shall be laboured by\r\nplaintiffs and defendants, not without promise of rewards, and therefore\r\nto be suspected of a bad conscience. I would wish a more careful choice\r\nof jurors to be had; for I have known a man carted, rung with basons,\r\nand banished out of Bishopsgate ward, and afterward in Aldgate ward\r\nadmitted to be a constable, a grand juryman, and foreman of the wardmote\r\ninquest: what I know of the like, or worse men, proffered to the like\r\noffices, I forbear to write, but wish to be reformed.\r\n\r\nThe foresaid conduit upon Cornhill, was in the year 1475 enlarged by\r\nRobert Drope, draper, mayor, that then dwelt in that ward; he increased\r\nthe cistern of this conduit with an east end of stone, and castellated\r\nin comely manner.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1546, Sir Martin Bowes, mayor, dwelling in Lombard street,\r\nand having his back gate opening into Cornehill against the said\r\nconduit, minded to have enlarged the cistern thereof with a west end,\r\nlike as Robert Drope before had done towards the east; view and measure\r\nof the plot was taken for this work; but the pillory and cage being\r\nremoved, they found the ground planked, and the well aforesaid worn out\r\nof memory, which well they revived and restored to use--it is since made\r\na pump; they set the pillory somewhat west from the well; and so this\r\nwork ceased.\r\n\r\nOn the north side of the street, from the east unto the west, have ye\r\ndivers fair houses for merchants and other, amongst the which one large\r\nhouse is called the Wey house, where merchandises brought from beyond\r\nthe seas are to be weighed at the king’s beam. This house hath a master,\r\nand under him four master porters, with porters under them: they have a\r\nstrong cart, and four great horses, to draw and carry the wares from the\r\nmerchants’ houses to the beam and back again. Sir Thomas Lovell, knight,\r\nbuilt this house, with a fair front of tenements towards the street; all\r\nwhich he gave to the Grocers of London, himself being free of the city,\r\nand a brother of that company.\r\n\r\nThen have ye the said Finke’s lane, the south end of which lane on both\r\nsides is in Cornehill ward.\r\n\r\nThen next is the Royal Exchange, erected in the year 1566, after this\r\norder, namely, certain houses upon Cornehill, and the like upon the\r\nback thereof, in the ward of Brode street, with three alleys, the\r\nfirst called Swan alley, opening into Cornehill, the second New alley,\r\npassing throughout of Cornehill into Brode street ward, over against\r\nSt. Bartholomew lane, the third St. Christopher’s alley, opening into\r\nBrode street ward, and into St. Christopher’s parish, containing in all\r\nfourscore households, were first purchased by the citizens of London,\r\nfor more than three thousand five hundred and thirty-two pounds, and\r\nwere sold for four hundred and seventy-eight pounds, to such persons as\r\nshould take them down and carry them thence; also the ground or plot was\r\nmade plain at the charges of the city; and then possession thereof was\r\nby certain aldermen, in name of the whole citizens, given to Sir Thomas\r\nGresham, knight, agent to the queen’s highness, thereupon to build a\r\nburse, or place for merchants to assemble, at his own proper charges.\r\nAnd he, on the 7th of June, laying the first stone of the foundation,\r\nbeing brick, accompanied with some aldermen, every of them laid a piece\r\nof gold, which the workmen took up, and forthwith followed upon the same\r\nwith such diligence, that by the month of November, in the year 1567,\r\nthe same was covered with slate, and shortly after fully finished.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1570, on the 23rd of January, the queen’s majesty, attended\r\nwith her nobility, came from her house at the Strand, called Somerset\r\nhouse, and entered the city by Temple Bar, through Fleet street, Cheape,\r\nand so by the north side of the burse, through Threeneedle street, to\r\nSir Thomas Gresham’s in Bishopsgate street, where she dined. After\r\ndinner her majesty returning through Cornehill, entered the burse on the\r\nsouth side; and after that she had viewed every part thereof above the\r\nground, especially the pawn, which was richly furnished with all sorts\r\nof the finest wares in the city, she caused the same burse by an herald\r\nand trumpet to be proclaimed the Royal Exchange, and so to be called\r\nfrom thenceforth, and not otherwise.\r\n\r\nNext adjoining this Royal Exchange remaineth one part of a large stone\r\nhouse, and is now called the Castle of such a sign; at a tavern door\r\nthere is a passage through out of Cornehill into Threeneedle street;\r\nthe other part of the said stone house was taken down for enlarging\r\nthe Royal Exchange: this stone house was said of some to have been a\r\nchurch, whereof it had no proportion, of others a Jew’s house, as though\r\nnone but Jews had dwelt in stone houses; but that opinion is without\r\nwarrant, for besides the strong building of stone houses against the\r\ninvasion of thieves in the night, when no watches were kept, in the 1st\r\nyear of Richard I., to prevent the casualties of fire, which often had\r\nhappened in the city, when the houses were built of timber, and covered\r\nwith reed or straw, Henry Fitz Alewine being mayor, it was decreed,\r\nthat from henceforth no man should build within the city but of stone,\r\nuntil a certain height, and to cover the same building with slate or\r\nburnt tile; and this was the very cause of such stone buildings, whereof\r\nmany have remained till our time, that for winning of ground they have\r\nbeen taken down, and in place of some one of them being low, as but\r\ntwo stories above the ground, many houses of four or five stories high\r\nare placed. From this stone house down to the Stocks are divers large\r\nhouses, especially for height, for merchants and artificers.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of this high street is the parish church of St. Peter\r\nupon Cornehill, which seemeth to be of an ancient building, but not\r\nso ancient as fame reporteth, for it hath been lately repaired, if\r\nnot all new built, except the steeple, which is ancient. The roof of\r\nthis church, and glazing, were finished in the reign of Edward IV., as\r\nappeareth by arms of noblemen and aldermen of London then living. There\r\nremaineth in this church a table whereon it is written, I know not by\r\nwhat authority, but of a late hand, that King Lucius founded the same\r\nchurch to be an archbishop’s see metropolitan,[162] and chief church of\r\nhis kingdom, and that it so endured the space of four hundred years,\r\nunto the coming of Augustin the monk.\r\n\r\nJoceline of Furness writeth, that Thean, the first archbishop of London,\r\nin the reign of Lucius, built the said church by the aid of Ciran, chief\r\nbutler to King Lucius; and also that Eluanus, the second archbishop,\r\nbuilt a library to the same adjoining, and converted many of the Druids,\r\nlearned men in the Pagan law, to Christianity. True it is, that a\r\nlibrary there was pertaining to this parish church of old time, built\r\nof stone, and of late repaired with brick by the executors of Sir John\r\nCrosby, alderman, as his arms on the south end doth witness.\r\n\r\nThis library hath been of late time, to wit, within these fifty years,\r\nwell furnished of books; John Leyland viewed and commended them; but\r\nnow those books be gone, and the place is occupied by a schoolmaster\r\nand his usher, over a number of scholars learning their grammar rules,\r\netc. Notwithstanding, before that time a grammar school had been kept in\r\nthis parish, as appeareth in the year 1425, I read, that John Whitby was\r\nrector, and John Steward schoolmaster there; and in the 25th of Henry\r\nVI., it was enacted by parliament, that four grammar schools in London\r\nshould be maintained, namely, in the parishes of Allhallows, in Thames\r\nstreet, St. Andrew in Oldbourne, St. Peter’s upon Cornehill, and St.\r\nThomas of Acars.\r\n\r\nMonuments of the dead in this church defaced: I read, that Hugh Waltham,\r\nNicholas Pricot, mercer, alderman, Richard Manhall, 1503; William\r\nKingston, fishmonger, gave his tenements called the Horse mill in\r\nGrasse street to this church, and was there buried about the year 1298;\r\nJohn Unisburgh, poulterer, 1410; John Law. Also Peter Mason, tailor,\r\ngave to this church seven pounds sterling yearly for ever, out of his\r\ntenements in Colechurch parish, and deceased about the year 1416. John\r\nFoxton founded a chantry there. A brotherhood of St. Peter was in this\r\nchurch established by Henry IV., the 4th of his reign. William Brampton\r\nand William Askham, fishmongers and aldermen, were chief procurers\r\nthereof, for the fishmongers of late buried there; Sir William Bowyer,\r\nmayor 1543; Sir Henry Huberthorn, mayor 1546; Sir Christopher Morice,\r\nmaster-gunner of England to King Henry VIII.; Edward Elrington, esquire,\r\nchief-butler to Edward VI.; Thomas Gardener, grocer; and Justice Smith,\r\nand other.\r\n\r\nThen have ye the parish church of St. Michael th’ Archangel; for the\r\nantiquity whereof I find that Alnothus the priest gave it to the abbot\r\nand convent of Covesham, Reynold abbot, and the convent there did\r\ngrant the same to Sperling the priest, in all measures as he and his\r\npredecessors before had held it; to the which Sperling also they granted\r\nall their lands which they there had, except certain lands which Orgar\r\nle Prowde had held of them, and paid two shilling yearly; for the which\r\ngrant the said Sperling should yearly pay one mark of rent to the said\r\nabbot of Covesham, and find him and his lodging, salt, water, and fire,\r\nwhen he came to London. This was granted 1133, about the 34th of Henry\r\nI. Thus much for antiquity; of later time I find, that Elizabeth Peake,\r\nwidow, gave the patronage or gift of this benefice to the Drapers in\r\nLondon; she lieth buried in the belfry, 1518: her monument yet remaineth.\r\n\r\nThis hath been a fair and beautiful church, but of late years, since\r\nthe surrender of their lands to Edward VI., greatly blemished by the\r\nbuilding of lower tenements on the north side thereof towards the high\r\nstreet, in place of a green churchyard, whereby the church is darkened,\r\nand other ways annoyed. The fair new steeple, or bell tower of this\r\nchurch, was begun to be built in the year 1421, which being finished,\r\nand a fair ring of five bells therein placed, a sixth bell[163] was\r\nadded, and given by John Whitwell, Isabel his wife, and William Rus,\r\nalderman, and goldsmith, about the year 1430, which bell, named “Rus,”\r\nnightly at eight of the clock, and otherwise for knells, and in peals,\r\nrung by one man, for the space of one hundred and sixty years, of late\r\noverhauled by four or five at once, hath been thrice broken, and new\r\ncast within the space of ten years, to the charges of that parish more\r\nthan one hundred marks.\r\n\r\nAnd here a note of this steeple: as I have oft heard my father report,\r\nupon St. James’ night, certain men in the loft next under the bells,\r\nringing of a peal, a tempest of lightning and thunder did arise, an\r\nugly shapen sight appeared to them, coming in at the south window, and\r\nlighted on the north, for fear whereof they all fell down, and lay as\r\ndead for the time, letting the bells ring and cease of their own accord;\r\nwhen the ringers came to themselves, they found certain stones of the\r\nnorth window to be razed and scratched, as if they had been so much\r\nbutter, printed with a lion’s claw; the same stones were fastened there\r\nagain, and so remain till this day. I have seen them oft, and have put\r\na feather or small stick into the holes where the claws had entered\r\nthree or four inches deep. At the same time certain main timber posts at\r\nQueene Hith were scratched and cleft from the top to the bottom; and the\r\npulpit cross in Powle’s churchyard was likewise scratched, cleft, and\r\noverturned. One of the ringers lived in my youth, whom I have oft heard\r\nto verify the same to be true.\r\n\r\nBut to return. William Rus was a special benefactor to this church;\r\nhis arms yet remain in the windows. William Comerton, Symon Smith,\r\nWalter Belingham, were buried there, and founded chantries there;\r\nJohn Grace, 1439; Robert Drope, mayor, buried on the north side of\r\nthe choir, under a fair tomb of grey marble, 1485, he gave to poor\r\nmaids’ marriages of that parish twenty pounds, to poor of that ward ten\r\npounds, shirts and smocks three hundred, and gowns of broad cloth one\r\nhundred, etc.[164] Jane his wife, matching with Edward Gray, Viscount\r\nLisle, was buried by her first husband, 1500; she gave ninety pounds\r\nin money to the beautifying of that church, and her great messuage,\r\nwith the appurtenance, which was by her executors, W. Caple and other,\r\n1517, the 9th of Henry VIII., assured to John Wardroper, parson, T.\r\nClearke, W. Dixson, and John Murdon, wardens of the said church, and\r\ntheir successors for ever, they do keep yearly for her an obite, or\r\nanniversary, to be spent on the poor, and otherwise, in all three\r\npounds, the rest of the profits to be employed in reparation of the\r\nchurch. In the 34th year of Henry VIII., Edward Stephan, parson, T.\r\nSpencer, P. Guntar, and G. Grouch, churchwardens, granted to T. Lodge a\r\nlease for sixty years of the said great messuage, with the appurtenance,\r\nwhich were called the Lady Lisle’s lands, for the rent of eight pounds\r\nthirteen shillings and four pence the year. The parishioners since gave\r\nit up as chantry land, and wronged themselves. Also the said Robert\r\nDrope, and Lady Lisle, notwithstanding their liberality to that church\r\nand parish, their tomb is pulled down, no monument remaineth of them.\r\nPeter Hawton, late alderman, is laid in their vault, 1596. Robert\r\nFabian, alderman, that wrote and published a Chronicle of England and of\r\nFrance, was buried there 1511, with this epitaph:--\r\n\r\n    “Like as the day his course doth consume,\r\n    And the new morrow springeth againe as fast,\r\n    So man and woman, by Nature’s custome,\r\n    This life to pass, at last in earth are cast,\r\n    In joy and sorrow, which here their time do wast,\r\n    Never in one state, but in course transitory,\r\n    So full of change is of this world the glory.”\r\n\r\nHis monument is gone. Richard Garnam, 1527, buried there; Edmond Trindle\r\nand Robert Smith;[165] William Dickson and Margaret his wife,[166]\r\nburied in the cloister under a fair tomb now defaced; Thomas Stow, my\r\ngrandfather, about the year 1526, and Thomas Stow, my father, 1559;\r\nJohn Tolus, alderman, 1548, he gave to John Willowby, parson of that\r\nchurch, to Thomas Lodge, G. Hind, P. Bolde, churchwardens, and to\r\ntheir successors, towards the reparation of that church, and relief of\r\nthe poor for ever, his tenement with the appurtenances in the parish\r\nof St. Michael, which he had lately purchased of Alvery Randalph, of\r\nBadlesmeere in Kent; but the parish never had the gift, nor heard\r\nthereof by the space of forty years after; such was the conscience of G.\r\nBarne and other the executors, to conceal it to themselves; and such is\r\nthe negligence of the parishioners, that being informed thereof, make no\r\nclaim thereunto. Philip Gonter, that was alderman for a time, and gave\r\nfour hundred pounds to be discharged thereof, was buried in the cloister\r\nabout the year 1582, and Anne his wife, etc. Thomas Houghton, father to\r\nthe said Peter Houghton, Francis Beneson, and William Towersan.\r\n\r\nThis parish church hath on the south side thereof a proper cloister,\r\nand a fair churchyard, with a pulpit cross, not much unlike to that in\r\nPaule’s churchyard. Sir John Rudstone, mayor, caused the same pulpit\r\ncross in his lifetime to be built, the churchyard to be enlarged, by\r\nground purchased of the next parish, and also proper houses to be\r\nraised for lodging of choir men, such as at that time were assistants\r\nto divine service, then daily sung by note in that church. The said\r\nJohn Rudstone deceased 1531, and was buried in a vault under the pulpit\r\ncross; he appointed sermons to be preached there, not now performed;\r\nhis tomb before the pulpit cross is taken thence, with the tomb of\r\nRichard Yaxley, Doctor of Physic to King Henry VIII. and other. The\r\nchoir of that church dissolved, the lodgings of choir men were by the\r\ngrave fathers of that time charitably appointed for receipt of ancient\r\ndecayed parishioners, namely, widows, such as were not able to bear the\r\ncharge of greater rents abroad, which blessed work of harbouring the\r\nharbourless is promised to be rewarded in the kingdom of heaven.\r\n\r\nThen have ye Birchover lane, so called of Birchover, the first builder\r\nand owner thereof, now corruptly called Birchin lane, the north half\r\nwhereof is of the said Cornehill ward; the other part is of Langborne\r\nward.\r\n\r\nThis lane, and the high street near adjoining, hath been inhabited for\r\nthe most part with wealthy drapers, from Birchover’s lane, on that side\r\nthe street down to the stocks, in the reign of Henry VI., had ye for the\r\nmost part dwelling Fripperers or Upholders, that sold old apparel and\r\nhousehold stuff.\r\n\r\nI have read of a countryman, that then having lost his hood in\r\nWestminster hall, found the same in Cornehill hanged out to be sold,\r\nwhich he challenged, but was forced to buy, or go without it, for their\r\nstall, they said, was their market. At that time also the wine drawer of\r\nthe Pope’s head tavern (standing without the door in the high street)\r\ntook the same man by the sleeve, and said, “Sir, will you drink a pint\r\nof wine?” whereunto he answered, “A penny spend I may;” and so drank his\r\npint, for bread nothing did he pay, for that was allowed free.[167]\r\n\r\nThis Pope’s head tavern, with other houses adjoining, strongly built\r\nof stone, hath of old time been all in one, pertaining to some great\r\nestate, or rather to the king of this realm, as may be supposed, both by\r\nthe largeness thereof, and by the arms, to wit, three leopards passant,\r\ngardant, which were the whole arms of England before the reign of Edward\r\nIII., that quartered them with the arms of France, three fleur-de-lis.\r\n\r\nThese arms of England, supported between two angels, are fair and\r\nlargely graven in stone on the fore front towards the high street, over\r\nthe door or stall of one great house, lately for many years possessed by\r\nMr. Philip Gunter. The Pope’s head tavern is on the back part thereof\r\ntowards the south, as also one other house called the stone house in\r\nLombard street. Some say this was King John’s house, which might so be;\r\nfor I find in a written copy of Matthew Paris’ History, that in the\r\nyear 1232, Henry III. sent Hubert de Burgh, Earl of Kent, to Cornehill\r\nin London, there to answer all matters objected against him, where he\r\nwisely acquitted himself. The Pope’s head tavern hath a footway through\r\nfrom Cornehill into Lombard street. And down lower on the high street of\r\nCornehill, is there one other way through by the Cardinal’s hat tavern\r\ninto Lombard street. And so let this suffice for Cornhill ward. In which\r\nbe governors:--an alderman, his deputy, common councillors four or six,\r\nconstables four, scavengers four, wardmote inquest sixteen and a beadle.\r\nIt is charged to the fifteen at sixteen pounds.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[158] “Their beef and mutton by weight, to wit.”--_1st edition_, p. 148.\r\n\r\n[159] “But the true cause of enhanceing the prices both of those and\r\nother victuals are not to be disputed here.”--_1st edition_, p. 148.\r\n\r\n[160] It would seem, from the addition of these words, which are not in\r\nthe first edition, that this conduit ceased so to run between the years\r\n1598 and 1603.\r\n\r\n[161] “Ringleaders of inquests will proffer their service, and bend\r\nevery way for gain. Careful choice of jurors is to be had; a man\r\ndetected, and that had sworn foolishly against his brother, is not\r\nto be admitted a common juror; neither butcher nor surgeon is to be\r\nadmitted.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\n[162] “Archbishops of London hard to be proved, and therefore not be\r\naffirmed.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\n[163] “This was accounted the best ring of six belles, to bee rung by\r\nsix men, that was in England, for harmonye, sweetness of sound, and\r\ntune.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\n[164] “To the poor at his burial sixteen pounds, to prisons, hospitals,\r\nand lazar houses, liberally; he also gave his house in Cornehill\r\nto be sold, and the price thereof to be spent on the amendment of\r\nhighways.”--_1st edition_, p. 153.\r\n\r\n[165] “My godfathers.”--_1st edition_, p. 153.\r\n\r\n[166] “My godmother.”--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n[167] “Wine one pint for a pennie, and bread to drink it was given free\r\nin every tavern.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLANGBORNE WARD, AND FENNIE ABOUT\r\n\r\n\r\nLangborne ward, so called of a long bourne of sweet water, which of old\r\ntime breaking out into Fenchurch street, ran down the same street and\r\nLombard street to the west end of St. Mary Woolnoth’s church, where\r\nturning south, and breaking into small shares, rills, or streams, it\r\nleft the name of Share borne lane, or South borne lane (as I have read),\r\nbecause it ran south to the river of Thames. This ward beginneth at the\r\nwest end of Aldgate ward in Fenne church street, by the Ironmongers’\r\nhall, which is on the north side of that street, at a place called\r\nCulver alley, where sometime was a lane, through the which men went\r\ninto Lime street, but that being long since stopped up for suspicion of\r\nthieves that lurked there by night, as is shown in Lime street ward,\r\nthere is now this said alley, a tennis-court, etc.\r\n\r\nFenne church street took that name of a fenny or moorish ground, so made\r\nby means of this borne which passed through it, and therefore until this\r\nday in the Guildhall of this city, that ward is called by the name of\r\nLangborne and Fennie about, and not otherwise; yet others be of opinion\r\nthat it took that name of _Fœnum_, that is, hay sold there, as Grasse\r\nstreet took the name of grass, or herbs, there sold.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this street standeth a small parish church called St.\r\nGabriel Fen church, corruptly Fan church.\r\n\r\nHelming Legget, esquire, by license of Edward III., in the 49th of\r\nhis reign, gave one tenement, with a curtelage thereto belonging,\r\nand a garden, with an entry thereto leading, unto Sir John Hariot,\r\nparson of Fenchurch, and to his successors for ever; the house to be a\r\nparsonage-house, the garden to be a churchyard, or burying-place for the\r\nparish.\r\n\r\nThen have ye Lombard street, so called of the Longobards, and other\r\nmerchants, strangers of divers nations assembling there twice every\r\nday, of what original or continuance I have not read of record, more\r\nthan that Edward II., in the 12th of his reign, confirmed a messuage,\r\nsometime belonging to Robert Turke, abutting on Lombard street toward\r\nthe south, and toward Cornehill on the north, for the merchants of\r\nFlorence, which proveth that street to have had the name of Lombard\r\nstreet before the reign of Edward II. The meeting of which merchants and\r\nothers there continued until the 22nd of December, in the year 1568; on\r\nthe which day the said merchants began to make their meetings at the\r\nburse, a place then new built for that purpose in the ward of Cornhill,\r\nand was since by her majesty, Queen Elizabeth, named the Royal Exchange.\r\n\r\nOn the north side of this ward is Lime street, one half whereof on both\r\nthe sides is of this Langborne ward, and therein on the west side is the\r\nPewterers’ hall, which company were admitted to be a brotherhood in the\r\n13th of Edward IV.\r\n\r\nAt the south-west corner of Lime street standeth a fair parish church\r\nof St. Dionys called Backe church, lately new built in the reign of\r\nHenry VI. John Bugge, esquire, was a great benefactor to that work, as\r\nappeareth by his arms, three water budgets, and his crest, a Morian’s\r\nhead, graven in the stone-work of the choir, the upper end on the north\r\nside, where he was buried. Also John Darby, alderman, added thereunto\r\na fair aisle, or chapel, on the south side, and was there buried about\r\nthe year 1466. He gave (besides sundry ornaments) his dwelling-house and\r\nothers unto the said church. The Lady Wich, widow to Hugh Wich, sometime\r\nmayor of London, was there buried, and gave lands for sermons, etc.\r\nJohn Master, gentleman, was by his children buried there 1444; Thomas\r\nBritaine; Henry Travers, of Maidstone, in Kent, merchant, 1501; John\r\nBond, about 1504; Robert Paget, merchant-tailor, one of the sheriffs,\r\n1536; Sir Thomas Curteis, pewterer, then fishmonger, mayor, 1557; Sir\r\nJames Harvie, ironmonger, mayor, 1581; William Peterson, esquire;\r\nWilliam Sherington; Sir Edward Osborne, clothworker, mayor, etc.\r\n\r\nThen by the four corners (so called of Fenchurch street in the east,\r\nBridge street on the south, Grasse street on the north, and Lombard\r\nstreet on the west), in Lombard street is one fair parish church\r\ncalled Allhallows Grasse church, in Lombard street; I do so read it\r\nin evidences of record, for that the grass market went down that way,\r\nwhen that street was far broader than now it is, being straitened by\r\nincroachments.\r\n\r\nThis church was lately new built. John Warner, armourer, and then\r\ngrocer, sheriff 1494, built the south aisle; his son, Robert Warner,\r\nesquire, finished it in the year 1516. The pewterers were benefactors\r\ntowards the north aisle, etc. The steeple, or bell tower, thereof was\r\nfinished in the year 1544, about the 36th of Henry VIII. The fair stone\r\nporch of this church was brought from the late dissolved priory of St.\r\nJohn of Jerusalem by Smithfield, so was the frame for their bells, but\r\nthe bells being bought, were never brought thither, by reason that one\r\nold Warner, draper, of that parish deceasing, his son Marke Warner would\r\nnot perform what his father had begun, and appointed, so that fair\r\nsteeple hath but one bell, as friars were wont to use. The monuments of\r\nthis church be these. The said Warners, and John Walden, draper.\r\n\r\nNext is a common hostelry for travellers, called the George, of such a\r\nsign. This is said to have pertained to the Earl Ferrers, and was his\r\nLondon lodging in Lombard street, and that in the year 1175, a brother\r\nof the said earl, being there privily slain in the night, was there\r\nthrown down into the dirty street, as I have afore shown in the chapter\r\nof night watches.\r\n\r\nNext to this is the parish church of St. Edmond, the king and martyr, in\r\nLombard street, by the south corner of Birchover lane. This church is\r\nalso called St. Edmond Grasse church, because the said grass market came\r\ndown so low. The monuments in this church are these: Sir John Milborne,\r\ndraper, mayor, deceased, 1535, buried there by Dame Joan and Dame\r\nMargaret his wives, under a tomb of touch; Humfrey Heyford, goldsmith,\r\nmayor 1477; Sir William Chester, draper, mayor 1560, with his wives,\r\namongst his predecessors; Sir George Barne, mayor 1586; Matilde at Vine\r\nfounded a chantry there, etc.\r\n\r\nFrom this church down Lombard street, by Birchover’s lane (the one half\r\nof which lane is of this ward), and so down, be divers fair houses,\r\nnamely, one with a very fair fore front towards the street, built by\r\nSir Martin Bowes, goldsmith, since mayor of London, and then one other,\r\nsometime belonging to William de la Pole, knight banneret, and yet the\r\nking’s merchant,[168] in the 14th of Edward III., and after him to\r\nMichael de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk, in the 14th of Richard II., and was\r\nhis merchant’s house, and so down towards the Stocks market, lacking but\r\nsome three houses thereof.\r\n\r\nThe south side of this ward beginneth in the east, at the chain to be\r\ndrawn athwart Mart lane up into Fenchurch street, and so west by the\r\nnorth end of Minchen lane to St. Margaret Patten’s street, or Roode\r\nlane, and down that street to the midway towards St. Margaret’s church;\r\nthen by Philpot lane (so called of Sir John Philpot that dwelt there,\r\nand was owner thereof), and down that lane some six or eight houses on\r\neach side, is all of this ward.\r\n\r\nThen by Grasse church corner into Lombard street to St. Clement’s lane,\r\nand down the same to St. Clement’s church; then down St. Nicholas lane,\r\nand down the same to St. Nicholas church, and the same church is of this\r\nward. Then to Abchurch church lane, and down some small portion thereof;\r\nthen down Sherborne lane, a part thereof, and a part of Bearebinder\r\nlane, be of this ward; and then down Lombard street to the sign of the\r\nAngel, almost to the corner over against the Stocks market.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of this ward, somewhat within Mart lane, have you the\r\nparish church of Allhallows, commonly called Stane church (as may be\r\nsupposed), for a difference from other churches of that name in this\r\ncity, which of old time were built of timber, and since were built of\r\nstone. In this church have been divers fair monuments of the dead,\r\nnamely, of John Costin, girdler, a great benefactor: he deceased 1244.\r\nHis name remaineth painted in the church roof; if it had been set in\r\nbrass, it would have been fetched down.[169] He gave out of certain\r\ntenements to the poor of that parish a hundred quarters of charcoals\r\nyearly for ever. Sir Robert Test, knight of the holy sepulchre, and\r\nDame Joan his wife, about 1486; Robert Stone; Sir John Steward, and\r\nDame Alice his wife;[170] John Bostocke, esquire; Christopher Holt,\r\nSir Richard Tate, knight, ambassador to King Henry VIII. buried there\r\n1554. His monument remaineth yet; the rest being all pulled down, and\r\nswept out of the church, the churchwardens were forced to make a large\r\naccount; 12_s._ that year for brooms, besides the carriage away of\r\nstone and brass of their own charge. And here I am to note, that being\r\ninformed of the Writhsleys to be buried there, I have since found them\r\nand other to be buried at St. Giles without Cripplegate, where I mind to\r\nleave them.\r\n\r\nBy this church sometime passed a lane, called Cradock’s lane, from\r\nMart lane, winding by the north side of the said church into Fenchurch\r\nstreet, the which lane being straitened by incroachments, is now called\r\nChurch alley.\r\n\r\nThen is the parish church of St. Nicholas Acon, or Hacon (for so have\r\nI read it in records), in Lombard street. Sir John Bridges, draper,\r\nmayor, 1520, newly repaired this church, and embattled it, and was there\r\nburied. Francis Boyer, grocer, one of the sheriffs, was buried there\r\n1580, with other of the Boyers: so was Julian, wife to John Lambart,\r\nalderman.[171]\r\n\r\nThen is there in the high street a proper parish church of St. Mary\r\nWoolnoth, of the Nativity, the reason of which name I have not yet\r\nlearnt. This church is lately new built. Sir Hugh Brice, goldsmith,\r\nmayor in the first year of Henry VII., keeper of the king’s exchange\r\nat London, and one of the governors of the king’s mint in the Tower of\r\nLondon, under William Lord Hastings, the 5th of Edward IV., deceased\r\n1496. He built in this church a chapel called the Charnell, as also part\r\nof the body of the church and of the steeple, and gave money toward\r\nthe finishing thereof, besides the stone which he had prepared: he\r\nwas buried in the body of the church. Guy Brice, or Boys, was buried\r\nthere. Dame Joan, wife to Sir William Peach;[172] Thomas Nocket,\r\ndraper, 1396: he founded a chantry there. Simon Eyre, 1459: he gave the\r\ntavern called the Cardinal’s Hat, in Lombard street, with a tenement\r\nannexed on the east part of the tavern, and a mansion behind the east\r\ntenement, together with an alley from Lombard street to Cornhill,\r\nwith the appurtenances, all which were by him new built, toward a\r\nbrotherhood of our Lady in St. Mary Woolnoth’s church. John Moager,\r\npewterer, and Emme his wife, in St. John’s chapel; Sir John Percivall,\r\nmerchant-tailor, mayor, about 1504; Thomas Roch, and Andrew Michael,\r\nvintners, and Joan their wife; William Hilton, merchant-tailor, and\r\ntailor to King Henry VIII., was buried there 1519, under the chapel of\r\nSt. George, which chapel was built by George Lufken, sometime tailor to\r\nthe prince; Robert Amades, goldsmith, master of the king’s jewels; Sir\r\nMartin Bowes, mayor, buried about 1569: he gave lands for the discharge\r\nof that Langborn ward, of all fifteens to be granted to the king by\r\nparliament; George Hasken, Sir Thomas Ramsey, late mayor, etc. Thus\r\nhave ye seven parishes in this ward, one hall of a company, divers fair\r\nhouses for merchants, and other monuments none. It hath an alderman, his\r\ndeputy, common councillors eight, constables fifteen, scavengers nine,\r\nmen of the wardmote inquest seventeen, and a beadle. It is taxed to the\r\nfifteen,[173] in the exchequer, at £20 9_s._ 8_d._\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[168] “Noblemen of this realm of old time, as also of late years, have\r\ndealt in merchandises.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\n[169] “If it had been in brasse, it would not have remained there so\r\nlong.”--_1st edition_, p. 159.\r\n\r\n[170] In the first edition, p. 159, the following passage is here\r\ninserted:--\r\n\r\n“Alice, William, and John, wife and sons to Thomas Clarell; Agnes,\r\ndaughter to Thomas Niter, gent.; William Atwell; Felix, daughter to\r\nSir Thomas Gisers, and wife to Travers Thomas Mason, esquire; Edmond\r\nWartar, esquire; Joan, wife to John Chamberlaine, esquire, daughter to\r\nRoger Lewkner, esquire; William Frier; John Hamburger, esquire; Hugh\r\nMoresby; Gilbert Prince, alderman; Oliver Chorley, gentleman; Sir John\r\nWrith, or Writhesley, _alias_ Garter principal king at arms, sometime\r\nlaid under a fair tomb in the choir, now broken down and gone; Joan,\r\nwife to Thomas Writhesley, son to Sir John Writhesley, Garter, daughter\r\nand heir to William Hall, esquire; John Writhesley the younger, son\r\nto Sir John Writhesley, and Alienor, Eleanor, second wife to John\r\nWrithesley, daughter and heir to Thomas Arnalde, and Agnes his wife;\r\nJohn Writhesley, son of Thomas; Agnes Arnold, first married to William\r\nWrithesley, daughter of Richard Warmeforde; Barbara Hungerford, daughter\r\nto Sir John Writhesley, wife to Anthony Hungerford, son to Sir Thomas\r\nHungerford, of Denmampney, in the county of Gloucester.”\r\n\r\nThe cause for the omission of these names is explained at the close of\r\nthe paragraph in the text; which is however so indistinctly expressed,\r\nthat its meaning could not very well be ascertained except by a\r\nreference to what was originally written.\r\n\r\n[171] “Mother of William Lambert, yet living.”--_1st edition_, p. 160.\r\n\r\n[172] “Hugh Acton, tailor.”--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n[173] “In London at twenty-one pound.”--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBILLINGSGATE WARD\r\n\r\n\r\nBillingsgate ward beginneth at the west end of Tower street ward in\r\nThames street, about Smart’s key, and runneth down along that street\r\non the south side to St. Magnus church at the bridge foot, and on the\r\nnorth side of the said Thames street, from over against Smart’s key,\r\ntill over against the north-west corner of St. Magnus church aforesaid,\r\non this north side of Thames street, is St. Marie hill lane, up to St.\r\nMargaret’s church, and then part of St. Margaret Patten’s street, at the\r\nend of St. Marie hill lane. Next out of Thames street is Lucas lane, and\r\nthen Buttolph lane, and at the north end thereof Philpot lane; then is\r\nRother lane, of old time so called, and thwart the same lane is Little\r\nEastcheape; and these be the bounds of Billingsgate ward.\r\n\r\nTouching the principal ornaments within this ward. On the south side\r\nof Thames street, beginning at the east end thereof, there is first\r\nthe said Smart’s key, so called of one Smart sometime owner thereof;\r\nthe next is Belinsgate, whereof the whole ward taketh name; the which\r\n(leaving out of the fable, thereof feigning it to be built by King\r\nBeline, a Briton, long before the incarnation of Christ), is at this\r\npresent a large water-gate, port, or harborough, for ships and boats,\r\ncommonly arriving there with fish, both fresh and salt, shell-fishes,\r\nsalt, oranges, onions, and other fruits and roots, wheat, rye, and grain\r\nof divers sorts, for service of the city and the parts of this realm\r\nadjoining. This gate is now more frequented than of old time, when\r\nthe Queen’s hithe was used, as being appointed by the kings of this\r\nrealm, to be the special or only port for taking up of all such kind of\r\nmerchandises brought to this city by strangers and foreigners, and the\r\ndrawbridge of timber at London bridge was then to be raised or drawn up\r\nfor passage of ships with tops thither.\r\n\r\nTouching the ancient customs of Belinsgate in the reign of Edward III.,\r\nevery great ship landing there paid for standage two-pence, every\r\nlittle ship with orelockes a penny, the lesser boat called a Battle a\r\nhalfpenny; of two quarters of corn measured the king was to have one\r\nfarthing, of a combe of corn a penny, of every weight going out of the\r\ncity a halfpenny, of two quarters of sea coal measured a farthing, and\r\nof every tun of ale going out of England beyond the seas, by merchant\r\nstrangers, four-pence, of every thousand herrings a farthing, except\r\nfranchises, etc.\r\n\r\nNext to this is Sommer’s key, which likewise took that name of one\r\nSommer dwelling there, as did Lion key of one Lion, owner thereof, and\r\nsince of the sign of a Lion.\r\n\r\nThen is there a fair wharf, or key, called Buttolph’s gate, by that\r\nname so called in the times of William the Conqueror, and of Edward the\r\nConfessor, as I have shown already in the description of the gates.\r\n\r\nNext is the parish church of St. Buttolphs, a proper church, and hath\r\nhad many fair monuments therein, now defaced and gone: notwithstanding I\r\nfind, by testimonies abroad, that these were buried there; to wit, Roger\r\nCoggar, 1384; Andrew Pikeman, and Joan his wife, 1391; Nicholas James,\r\nironmonger, one of the sheriffs, 1423; William Rainwell, fishmonger,\r\nand John Rainwell, his son, fishmonger, mayor 1426, and deceasing 1445,\r\nburied there with this epitaph:\r\n\r\n    “Citizens of London, call to your remembrance,\r\n    The famous John Rainwell, sometime your Maior.\r\n    Of the staple of Callis, so was his chance.\r\n    Here lieth now his corps; his soule bright and faire,\r\n    Is taken to heaven’s blisse, thereof is no dispaire.\r\n    His acts beare witnes, by matters of recorde,\r\n    How charitable he was, and of what accorde,\r\n    No man hath beene so beneficiall as hee,\r\n    Unto the Citie in giving liberallie,” etc.\r\n\r\nHe gave a stone house to be a revestrie to that church for ever; more,\r\nhe gave lands and tenements to the use of the commonalty, that the\r\nmayor and chamberlain should satisfy unto the discharge of all persons\r\ninhabiting the wards of Belinsgate, Downegate, and Aldgate, as oft as it\r\nshall happen any fifteen, by parliament of the king to be granted, also\r\nto the Exchequer, in discharge of the sheriffs, ten pounds yearly, which\r\nthe sheriffs used to pay for the farm of Southwark, so that all men of\r\nthe realm, coming or passing with carriage, should be free quitted and\r\ndischarged of all toll and other payments, aforetime claimed by the\r\nsheriffs. Further, that the mayor and chamberlain shall pay yearly to\r\nthe sheriffs eight pounds, so that the said sheriffs take no manner of\r\ntoll or money of any person of this realm for their goods, merchandises,\r\nvictuals, and carriages, for their passages at the great gate of the\r\nbridge of the city, nor at the gate called the Drawbridge, etc. The\r\noverplus of money coming of the said lands and tenements, divided into\r\neven portions; the one part to be employed to instore the granaries of\r\nthe city with wheat for the release of the poor commonalty, and the\r\nother moiety to clear and cleanse the shelves, and other stoppages of\r\nthe river of Thames, etc.\r\n\r\nStephen Forstar, fishmonger, mayor in the year 1454, and Dame Agnes his\r\nwife, lie buried there. William Bacon, haberdasher, one of the sheriffs\r\n1480, was there buried, besides many other persons of good worship,\r\nwhose monuments are all destroyed by bad and greedy men of spoil.\r\n\r\nThis parish of St. Buttolph is no great thing, notwithstanding divers\r\nstrangers are there harboured, as may appear by a presentment, not many\r\nyears since made of strangers, inhabitants in the ward of Billingsgate,\r\nin these words: “In Billingsgate ward were one and fifty households of\r\nstrangers, whereof thirty of these households inhabited in the parish\r\nof St. Buttolph, in the chief and principal houses, where they give\r\ntwenty pounds the year for a house lately letten for four marks; the\r\nnearer they dwell to the water-side the more they give for houses, and\r\nwithin thirty years before there was not in the whole ward above three\r\nNetherlanders; at which time there was within the said parish levied,\r\nfor the help of the poor, seven and twenty pounds by the year; but since\r\nthey came so plentifully thither, there cannot be gathered above eleven\r\npounds, for the stranger will not contribute to such charges as other\r\ncitizens do.” Thus much for that south side of this ward.\r\n\r\nOn the north side is Bosse alley, so called of a boss of spring water\r\ncontinually running, which standeth by Billingsgate against this alley,\r\nand was sometime made by the executors of Richard Whittington.\r\n\r\nThen is St. Marie hill lane, which runneth up north from Billingsgate\r\nto the end of St. Margaret Pattens, commonly called Roode lane, and the\r\ngreatest half of that lane is also of Belinsgate ward. In this St. Marie\r\nhill lane is the fair parish church of St. Marie, called on the hill,\r\nbecause of the ascent from Billingsgate.\r\n\r\nThis church hath been lately built, as may appear by this that\r\nfolloweth. Richard Hackney, one of the sheriff’s in the year 1322, and\r\nAlice his wife, were there buried, as Robert Fabian writeth, saying\r\nthus:--“In the year 1497, in the month of April, as labourers digged for\r\nthe foundation of a wall, within the church of St. Marie hill, near unto\r\nBelinsgate, they found a coffin of rotten timber, and therein the corpse\r\nof a woman whole of skin, and of bones undissevered, and the joints of\r\nher arms pliable, without breaking of the skin, upon whose sepulchre\r\nthis was engraven:--‘Here lieth the bodies of Richard Hackney,\r\nfishmonger, and Alice his wife.’”[174] The which Richard was sheriff\r\nin the 15th of Edward II. Her body was kept above ground three or four\r\ndays without nuisance, but then it waxed unsavoury, and so was again\r\nburied. John Mordand, stock-fishmonger, was buried there, 1387; Nicholas\r\nExton, fishmonger, mayor 1387; William Cambridge, mayor, 1420; Richard\r\nGoslin, sheriff, 1422; William Philip, sergeant-at-arms, 1473; Robert\r\nReuell, one of the sheriffs 1490, gave liberally toward the new building\r\nof this church and steeple, and was there buried; William Remington,\r\nmayor, 1500; Sir Thomas Blanke, mayor, 1582; William Holstocke, esquire,\r\ncomptroller of the king’s ships; Sir Cuthbert Buckle, mayor, 1594.\r\n\r\nThis lane on both sides is furnished with many fair houses for\r\nmerchants; and hath at the north end thereof one other lane, called\r\nSt. Margaret Pattens, because of old time pattens were there usually\r\nmade and sold; but of latter time this is called Roode lane, of a roode\r\nthere placed in the churchyard of St. Margaret, whilst the old church\r\nwas taken down, and again newly built; during which time the oblations\r\nmade to this rood were employed towards building of the church; but in\r\nthe year 1538, about the 23rd of May, in the morning, the said rood was\r\nfound to have been in the night preceding, by people unknown, broken\r\nall to pieces, together with the tabernacle wherein it had been placed.\r\nAlso, on the 27th of the same month, in the same parish, amongst the\r\nbasket makers, a great and sudden fire happened in the night season,\r\nwhich within the space of three hours consumed more than a dozen houses,\r\nand nine persons were burnt to death there: and thus ceased that work of\r\nthis church, being at that time nigh finished to the steeple.\r\n\r\nThe lane on both sides beyond the same church to the midway towards\r\nFenchurch street, is of Bellinsgate ward.\r\n\r\nThen again out of Thames street, by the west end of St. Mary hill\r\nchurch, runneth up one other lane, of old time called Roape lane, since\r\ncalled Lucas lane, of one Lucas, owner of some part thereof, and now\r\ncorruptly called Love lane; it runneth up by the east end of a parish\r\nchurch of St. Andrew Hubbert, or St. Andrew in East Cheap. This church,\r\nand all the whole lane called Lucas lane, is of this Belinsgate ward.\r\n\r\nThen have ye one other lane out of Thames street, called Buttolph lane,\r\nbecause it riseth over against the parish church of St. Buttolph, and\r\nrunneth up north by the east end of St. George’s church to the west end\r\nof St. Andrew’s church, and to the south end of Philpot lane.\r\n\r\nThis parish church of St. George in Buttolph lane is small, but the\r\nmonuments for two hundred years past are well preserved from spoil,\r\nwhereof one is of Adam Bamme, mayor 1397; Richard Bamme, esquire,\r\nhis son, of Gillingham in Kent, 1452; John Walton, gentleman, 1401;\r\nMarpor, a gentleman, 1400; John St. John, merchant of Levant, and Agnes\r\nhis wife, 1400; Hugh Spencer, esquire, 1424; William Combes, stock\r\nfishmonger, one of the sheriffs 1452, who gave forty pounds towards the\r\nworks of that church; John Stokar, draper, one of the sheriffs, 1477;\r\nRichard Dryland, esquire, and Katherine his wife, daughter of Morrice\r\nBrune, knight, of Southuckenton in Essex, steward of household to\r\nHumfrey Duke of Glocester, 1487; Nicholas Patrich, one of the sheriffs,\r\n1519. In the churchyard: William Forman, mayor, 1538; James Mumford,\r\nesquire, surgeon to King Henry VIII., buried 1544; Thomas Gayle,\r\nhaberdasher, 1340; Nicholas Wilford, merchant-tailor, and Elizabeth his\r\nwife, about the year 1551; Edward Heyward, 1573, etc. Roger Delakere\r\nfounded a chantry there.\r\n\r\nThen have ye one other lane called Rother lane, or Red Rose lane,\r\nof such a sign there, now commonly called Pudding lane, because the\r\nbutchers of Eastcheap have their scalding house for hogs there, and\r\ntheir puddings, with other filth of beasts, are voided down that way to\r\ntheir dung boats on the Thames.\r\n\r\nThis lane stretcheth from Thames street to Little East Cheape,\r\nchiefly inhabited by basket-makers, turners, and butchers, and is all\r\nof Billinsgate ward. The Garland in Little East Cheape, sometime a\r\nbrewhouse, with a garden on the back side, adjoining to the garden of\r\nSir John Philpot, was the chief house in this East Cheape; it is now\r\ndivided into sundry small tenements, etc.\r\n\r\nThis ward hath an alderman, and his deputy, common councillors,\r\nconstables eleven, scavengers six, for the wardmote inquest fourteen,\r\nand a beadle; it is taxed to the fifteen in London at thirty-two pounds,\r\nand in the Exchequer at thirty-one pounds ten shillings.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[174] “Alice Hackney found uncorrupted more than one hundred and seventy\r\nyeres after she was buried.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIDGE WARD WITHIN\r\n\r\n\r\nBridge ward within, so called of London bridge, which bridge is a\r\nprincipal part of that ward, and beginneth at the stulpes on the south\r\nend by Southwark, runneth along the bridge, and north up Bridge street,\r\ncommonly called (of the fish market) New Fish street, from Fish street\r\nhill, up Grasse street, to the north corner of Grasse church; all the\r\nbridge is replenished on both the sides with large, fair, and beautiful\r\nbuildings, inhabitants for the most part rich merchants, and other\r\nwealthy citizens, mercers, and haberdashers.\r\n\r\nIn New Fish street be fishmongers and fair taverns on Fish street hill\r\nand Grasse street, men of divers trades, grocers and haberdashers.\r\n\r\nIn Grasse street have ye one fair conduit of sweet water castellated\r\nwith crest and vent, made by the appointment of Thomas Hill, mayor,\r\n1484, who gave by his testament one hundred marks towards the conveyance\r\nof water to this place. It was begun by his executors in the year 1491,\r\nand finished of his goods whatsoever it cost.\r\n\r\nOn the east side of this bridge ward have ye the fair parish church\r\nof St. Magnus; in the which church have been buried many men of good\r\nworship, whose monuments are now for the most part utterly defaced.\r\nI find John Blund, mayor, 1307; Henry Yeuele, freemason to Edward\r\nIII., Richard II., and Henry IV., who deceased 1400; his monument\r\nyet remaineth; William Brampton; John Michell, mayor, 1436; John\r\nFrench, baker, yeoman of the crown to Henry VII., 1510; Robert Clarke,\r\nfishmonger, 1521; Richard Turke, one of the sheriffs, 1549; William\r\nSteede, alderman; Richard Morgan, knight, chief justice of the common\r\npleas, 1556; Mauritius Griffeth, Bishop of Rochester, 1559; Robert\r\nBlanch, girdler, 1567; Robert Belgrave, girdler; William Brame, John\r\nCouper, fishmonger, alderman, who was put by his turn of mayoralty\r\n1584; Sir William Garrard, haberdasher, mayor 1555; a grave, wise, and\r\ndiscreet citizen, equal with the best and inferior to none of our time,\r\ndeceased 1571 in the parish of St. Christopher, but was buried in this\r\nchurch of St. Magnus as in the parish where he was born; a fair monument\r\nis there raised on him; Robert Harding, salter, one of the sheriffs,\r\n1568; Simon Low, merchant-tailor, esquire, etc.\r\n\r\nThen is the parish church of St. Margaret on Fish street hill, a proper\r\nchurch, but monuments it hath none: a footway passeth by the south side\r\nof this church from Fish street hill unto Rother lane.\r\n\r\nUp higher on this hill is the parish church of St. Leonard, Milke\r\nchurch, so termed of one William Melker, an especial builder thereof,\r\nbut commonly called St. Leonard’s in East Cheape, because it standeth at\r\nEast Cheape corner. Monuments there be of the Doggets, namely, Walter\r\nDogget, vintner, one of the sheriffs, 1380; John Dogget, vintner, and\r\nAlice his wife, about 1456; this John Dogget gave lands to that church;\r\nWilliam Dogget, etc.\r\n\r\nThis church, and from thence into Little East Cheape to the east end of\r\nthe said church, is of the Bridge ward.\r\n\r\nThen higher in Grasse street is the parish church of St. Bennet, called\r\nGrasse church, of the herb-market there kept: this church also is of\r\nthe Bridge ward, and the farthest north end thereof. Some monuments\r\nremain there undefaced, as of John Harding, salter, 1576; John Sturgeon,\r\nhaberdasher, chamberlain of London; Philip Cushen, Florentine, a famous\r\nmerchant, 1600.\r\n\r\nThe customs of Grass church market, in the reign of Edward III., as\r\nI have read in a book of customs, were these: Every foreign cart\r\nladen with corn or malt, coming thither to be sold, was to pay one\r\nhalfpenny, every foreign cart bringing cheese two-pence, every cart of\r\ncorn and cheese together (if the cheese be more worth than the corn)\r\ntwo-pence, and if the corn be more worth than the cheese, it was to pay\r\na halfpenny; of two horses laden with corn or malt the bailiff had one\r\nfarthing; the cart of the franchise of the Temple and of St. Martin le\r\nGrand paid a farthing; the cart of the hospital of St. John of Jerusalem\r\npaid nothing for their proper goods, and if the corn were brought by\r\nmerchants to sell again, the load paid a halfpenny, etc.\r\n\r\nOn the west side of this ward, at the north end of London bridge, is a\r\npart of Thames street, which is also of this ward, to wit, so much as\r\nof old time was called Stocke Fishmonger row, of the stock fishmongers\r\ndwelling there, down west to a watergate, of old time called Ebgate,\r\nsince Ebgate lane, and now the Old Swan, which is a common stair on the\r\nThames, but the passage is very narrow by means of encroachments. On the\r\nsouth side of Thames street, about the midway betwixt the bridge foot\r\nand Ebgate lane, standeth the Fishmongers’ hall, and divers other fair\r\nhouses for merchants.\r\n\r\nThese fishmongers were sometimes of two several companies, to wit,\r\nStock-fishmongers and Salt-fishmongers, of whose antiquity I read, that\r\nby the name of fishmongers of London, they were, for forestalling,\r\netc., contrary to the laws and constitutions of the city, fined to the\r\nking at five hundred marks, the 18th of King Edward I. More, that the\r\nsaid fishmongers, hearing of the great victory obtained by the same\r\nking against the Scots, in the 26th of his reign, made a triumphant\r\nand solemn show through the city, with divers pageants, and more than\r\none thousand horsemen, etc., as in the chapter of sports and pastimes.\r\nThese two companies of stock-fishmongers and salt-fishmongers of old\r\ntime had their several halls; to wit, in Thames street twain, in New\r\nFish street twain, and in Old Fish street twain: in each place one for\r\neither company, in all six several halls, the company was so great, as I\r\nhave read, and can prove by records. These fishmongers having been jolly\r\ncitizens, and six mayors of their company in the space of twenty-four\r\nyears; to wit, Walter Turke, 1350; John Lofkin, 1359; John Wroth, 1361;\r\nJohn Pechie, 1362; Simon Morden, 1369; and William Walworth, 1374. It\r\nfollowed that in the year 1382, through the counsel of John Northampton,\r\ndraper, then being mayor, William Essex, John More, mercer, and Richard\r\nNorthburie, the said fishmongers were greatly troubled, hindered of\r\ntheir liberties, and almost destroyed by congregations made against\r\nthem, so that in a parliament at London the controversy depending\r\nbetween the mayor and aldermen of London, and the fishmongers there,\r\nNicholas Exton, speaker for the fishmongers, prayeth the king to receive\r\nhim and his company into his protection, for fear of corporal hurt:\r\nwhereupon it was commanded, either part to keep the peace, on pain\r\nof losing all they had; hereupon, a fishmonger, starting up, replied\r\nthat the complaint brought against them by the movers, etc., was but\r\nmatter of malice, for that the fishmongers, in the reign of Edward\r\nIII., being chief officers of the city, had for their misdemeanors then\r\ndone, committed the chief exhibitors of those petitions to prison. In\r\nthis parliament the fishmongers, by the king’s charter patents, were\r\nrestored to their liberties; notwithstanding in the year next following,\r\nto wit, 1383, John Cavendish, fishmonger, craveth the peace against the\r\nchancellor of England, which was granted, and he put in sureties the\r\nEarls of Stafford and Salisburie. Cavendish challengeth the chancellor\r\nfor taking of a bribe of ten pounds for favour of his case, which the\r\nchancellor by oath upon the sacrament avoideth. In further trial it\r\nwas found that the chancellor’s man, without his master’s privity, had\r\ntaken it; whereupon Cavendish was adjudged to prison, and to pay the\r\nchancellor one thousand marks for slandering him.\r\n\r\nAfter this, many of the nobles assembled at Reading to suppress the\r\nseditious stirs of the said John Northampton, or Combarton, late\r\nmayor, that had attempted great and heinous enterprises, of the which\r\nhe was convicted; and when he stood mute, nor would utter one word, it\r\nwas decreed that he should be committed to perpetual prison, his goods\r\nconfiscate to the king’s use, and that he should not come within one\r\nhundred miles of London during his life. He was therefore sent to the\r\ncastle of Tintegall in the confines of Cornewall, and in the mean space\r\nthe king’s servants spoiled his goods. John More, Richard Northbery,\r\nand other, were likewise there convicted, and condemned to perpetual\r\nprison, and their goods confiscate, for certain congregations by them\r\nmade against the fishmongers in the city of London, as is aforesaid;\r\nbut they obtained and had the king’s pardon, in the 14th of his reign,\r\nas appeareth of record; and thus were all these troubles quieted. Those\r\nstock-fishmongers and salt-fishmongers were united in the year 1536, the\r\n28th of Henry VIII.; their hall to be but one, in the house given unto\r\nthem by Sir John Cornwall, Lord Fanhope, and of Ampthull, in the parish\r\nof St. Michael in Crooked lane, in the reign of Henry VI. Thus much\r\nhave I thought good to note of the fishmongers, men ignorant of their\r\nantiquities, not able to show a reason why or when they were joined in\r\namity with the goldsmiths, do give part of their arms, etc. Neither,\r\nto say aught of Sir William Walworth,[175] the glory of their company,\r\nmore than that he slew Jack Straw, which is a mere fable, for the said\r\nStraw was after overthrowing of the rebels, taken, and by judgment of\r\nthe mayor beheaded; whose confession at the gallows is extant in my\r\n_Annals_, where also is set down the most valiant and praiseworthy act\r\nof William Walworth against the principal rebel Waltar Tighlar. As in\r\nreproof of Walworth’s monument in St. Michael’s church, I have declared,\r\nand wished to be reformed there, as in other places.\r\n\r\nOn that south side of Thames street have ye Drinkwater wharf and Fish\r\nwharf, in the parish of St. Magnus. On the north side of Thames street\r\nis St. Martin’s lane; a part of which lane is also of this ward, to wit,\r\non the one side to a well of water, and on the other side as far up\r\nas against the said well. Then is St. Michael’s lane, part whereof is\r\nalso of this ward up to a well there, etc. Then at the upper end of New\r\nFish street is a lane turning towards St. Michael’s lane, and is called\r\nCrooked lane, of the crooked windings thereof.\r\n\r\nAbove this lane’s end, upon Fish street hill, is one great house, for\r\nthe most part built of stone, which pertained sometime to Edward the\r\nBlack Prince, son to Edward III., who was in his lifetime lodged there.\r\nIt is now altered to a common hostelry, having the Black Bell for a sign.\r\n\r\nAbove this house, at the top of Fish street hill, is a turning into\r\nGreat Eastcheape, and so to the corner of Lombard street, over against\r\nthe north-west corner of Grasse church; and these be the whole bounds of\r\nthis Bridge ward within: the which hath an alderman and his deputy, for\r\nthe common council sixteen, constables fifteen, scavengers six, for the\r\nwardmote inquest sixteen, and a beadle. It is taxed to the fifteen in\r\nLondon at forty-seven pounds.[176]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[175] “W. Walworth slandered by a fable of Jack Straw.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANDLEWICK STREET WARD\r\n\r\n\r\nCandlewick street, or Candlewright street ward, beginneth at the\r\neast end of Great Eastcheape; it passeth west through Eastcheape to\r\nCandlewright street, and through the same, down to the north end of\r\nSuffolk lane on the south side, and down that lane by the west end of\r\nSt. Laurence churchyard, which is the farthest west part of that ward.\r\nThe street of Great Eastcheape is so called of the market there kept in\r\nthe east part of the city, as Westcheape is a market so called of being\r\nin the west.\r\n\r\nThis Eastcheape is now a flesh market of butchers there dwelling on\r\nboth sides of the street: it had sometime also cooks mixed amongst the\r\nbutchers, and such other as sold victuals ready dressed of all sorts.\r\nFor of old time, when friends did meet, and were disposed to be merry,\r\nthey went not to dine and sup in taverns, but to the cooks, where they\r\ncalled for meat what they liked, which they always found ready dressed\r\nat a reasonable rate, as I have before showed.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1410, the 11th of Henry IV., upon the even of St. John\r\nBaptist, the king’s sons,[177] Thomas and John, being in Eastcheape at\r\nsupper (or rather at breakfast, for it was after the watch was broken\r\nup, betwixt two and three of the clock after midnight), a great debate\r\nhappened between their men and other of the court, which lasted one\r\nhour, till the mayor and sheriffs with other citizens, appeased the\r\nsame; for the which afterwards the said mayor, aldermen, and sheriffs\r\nwere called to answer before the king, his sons, and divers lords,\r\nbeing highly moved against the city. At which time, William Gascoyne,\r\nchief justice, required the mayor and aldermen, for the citizens, to put\r\nthem in the king’s grace; whereunto they answered, that they had not\r\noffended, but (according to the law) had done their best in stinting\r\ndebate and maintaining of the peace; upon which answer the king remitted\r\nall his ire, and dismissed them. And to prove this Eastcheape to be a\r\nplace replenished with cooks, it may appear by a song called London\r\nLickepennie, made by Lidgate, a monk of Berrie, in the reign of Henry\r\nV., in the person of a countryman coming to London, and travelling\r\nthrough the same. In Westcheape (saith the song) he was called on to\r\nbuy fine lawn, Paris thread, cotton umble, and other linen clothes,\r\nand such like (he speaketh of no silks),[178] in Cornhill, to buy old\r\napparel[179] and household stuff, where he was forced to buy his own\r\nhood, which he had lost in Westminster hall: in Candlewright street\r\ndrapers proffered him cheap cloth, in Eastcheape the cooks cried hot\r\nribs of beef roasted, pies well baked, and other victuals: there was\r\nclattering of pewter-pots, harp, pipe, and sawtry, yea by cock, nay by\r\ncock, for greater oaths were spared: some sang of Jenken, and Julian,\r\netc.; all which melody liked well the passenger, but he wanted money to\r\nabide by it, and therefore gat him into Gravesend barge, and home into\r\nKent.\r\n\r\nCandlewright (so called in old records of the Guildhall, of St. Marie\r\nOveries, and other), or Candlewick street, took that name (as may be\r\nsupposed) either of chandlers, or makers of candles, both of wax and\r\ntallow; for candlewright is a maker of candles, or of wick, which is\r\nthe cotton or yarn thereof; or otherwise wike,[180] which is the place\r\nwhere they used to work them, as Scalding wike by the Stocks market was\r\ncalled of the poulterers scalding and dressing their poultry there;\r\nand in divers countries, dairy houses, or cottages, wherein they make\r\nbutter and cheese, are usually called wicks. There dwelt also of old\r\ntime divers weavers of woollen clothes, brought in by Edward III. For\r\nI read, that in the 44th of his reign, the weavers, brought out of\r\nFlanders, were appointed their meetings to be in the churchyard of St.\r\nLaurence Poultney, and the weavers of Brabant in the churchyard of St.\r\nMary Sommerset. There were then in this city weavers of divers sorts; to\r\nwit, of drapery, or tapery, and napery. These weavers of Candlewright\r\nstreet being in short time worn out, their place is now possessed by\r\nrich drapers, sellers of woollen cloth, etc.\r\n\r\nOn the north side of this ward, at the west end of Eastcheape, have ye\r\nSt. Clement’s lane; a part whereof on both sides is of Candlewick street\r\nward, to wit, somewhat north beyond the parish church of St. Clement in\r\nEastcheape. This is a small church, void of monuments, other than of\r\nFrancis Barnam, alderman, who deceased 1575, and of Benedicke Barnam,\r\nhis son, alderman also, 1598. William Chartney and William Overie\r\nfounded a chantry there.\r\n\r\nNext is St. Nicholas lane, for the most part on both sides of this ward,\r\nalmost to St. Nicholas church. Then is Abchurch lane, which is on both\r\nthe sides almost wholly of this ward, the parish church there (called\r\nof St. Marie Abchurch, Apechurch, or Upchurch, as I have read it),\r\nstandeth somewhat near unto the south end thereof, on a rising ground:\r\nit is a fair church. Simon de Winchcomb founded a chantry there the\r\n19th of Richard II.; John Littleton founded another, and Thomas Hondon\r\nanother; and hath the monuments of J. Long, esquire, of Bedfordshire,\r\n1442; William Wikenson, alderman, 1519; William Jawdrell, tailor, 1440;\r\nSir James Hawes, mayor 1574; Sir John Branch, mayor 1580; John Miners;\r\nWilliam Kettle, etc.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of this ward, beginning again at the east, is St.\r\nMichael’s lane, which lane is almost wholly of this ward, on both sides\r\ndown towards Thames street, to a well or pump there. On the east side of\r\nthis lane is Crooked lane aforesaid, by St. Michael’s church, towards\r\nNew Fish street. One the most ancient house in this lane is called the\r\nLeaden porch, and belonged sometime to Sir John Merston. knight, the 1st\r\nof Edward IV. It is now called the Swan in Crooked lane, possessed of\r\nstrangers, and selling of Rhenish wine. The parish church of this St.\r\nMichael’s was sometime but a small and homely thing, standing upon part\r\nof that ground wherein now standeth the parsonage-house; and the ground\r\nthere about was a filthy plot, by reason of the butchers in Eastcheape,\r\nwho made the same their laystall. William de Burgo gave two messuages to\r\nthat church in Candlewick street, 1317. John Lofkin, stock-fishmonger,\r\nfour times mayor, built in the same ground this fair church of St.\r\nMichael, and was buried there in the choir, under a fair tomb, with\r\nthe images of him and his wife, in alabaster. The said church hath\r\nbeen since increased with a new choir, and side chapels by Sir William\r\nWalworth, stock-fishmonger, mayor, sometime servant to the said John\r\nLofkin: also the tomb of Lofkin was removed, and a flat stone of grey\r\nmarble garnished with plates of copper laid on him, as it yet remaineth\r\nin the body of the church. This William Walworth is reported to have\r\nslain Jack Straw,[181] but Jack Straw being afterward taken, was first\r\nadjudged by the said mayor, and then executed by the loss of his head in\r\nSmithfield.\r\n\r\nTrue it is that this William Walworth, being a man wise, learned, and\r\nof an incomparable manhood,[182] arrested Wat Tyler, a presumptuous\r\nrebel, upon whom no man durst lay hand, whereby he delivered the king\r\nand kingdom from most wicked tyranny of traitors. The mayor arrested him\r\non the head with a sound blow, whereupon Wat Tyler, furiously struck\r\nthe mayor with his dagger, but hurt him not, by reason he was well\r\narmed. The mayor, having received his stroke, drew his basiliard, and\r\ngrievously wounded Wat in the neck, and withal gave him a great blow on\r\nthe head; in the which conflict, an esquire of the king’s house, called\r\nJohn Cavendish, drew his sword, and wounded Wat twice or thrice even to\r\nthe death; and Wat, spurring his horse, cried to the commons to revenge\r\nhim: the horse bare him about eighty feet from the place, and there\r\nhe fell down half dead; and by and by they which attended on the king\r\nenvironed him about, so as he was not seen of his company: many of them\r\nthrust him in divers places of his body, and drew him into the hospital\r\nof St. Bartholomew, from whence again the mayor caused him to be drawn\r\ninto Smithfield, and there to be beheaded. In reward of this service\r\n(the people being dispersed) the king commanded the mayor to put a\r\nbascinet on his head; and the mayor requesting why he should do so, the\r\nking answered, he being much bound unto him, would make him knight: the\r\nmayor answered, that he was neither worthy nor able to take such estate\r\nupon him, for he was but a merchant, and had to live by his merchandise\r\nonly; notwithstanding, the king bade him to put on his bascinet, and\r\nthen with a sword in both his hands he strongly stroke him on the neck,\r\nas the manner was then; and the same day he made three other citizens\r\nknights for his sake in the same place; to wit, John Philpot, Nicholas\r\nBrember, and Robert Launde, alderman. The king gave to the mayor one\r\nhundred pounds land by year, and to each of the other forty pounds land\r\nyearly, to them and their heirs for ever.\r\n\r\nAfter this, in the same year, the said Sir William Walworth, founded in\r\nthe said parish church of St. Michael a college of a master and nine\r\npriests, or chaplains, and deceased 1385, was there buried in the north\r\nchapel by the choir; but his monument being amongst other by bad people\r\ndefaced in the reign of Edward VI., and again since renewed by the\r\nfishmongers, for lack of knowledge of what before had been written in\r\nhis epitaph, they followed a fabulous book, and wrote Jack Straw instead\r\nof Wat Tilar, a great error meet to be reformed there and elsewhere; and\r\ntherefore have I the more at large discoursed of this matter.\r\n\r\nIt hath also been, and is now grown to a common opinion, that in reward\r\nof this service done by the said William Walworth against the rebel,\r\nKing Richard added to the arms of this city (which was argent, a plain\r\ncross gules) a sword or dagger (for so they term it), whereof I have\r\nread no such record, but to the contrary. I find that in the 4th year of\r\nRichard II.,[183] in a full assembly made in the upper chamber of the\r\nGuildhall, summoned by this William Walworth, then mayor, as well of\r\naldermen as of the common council, in every ward, for certain affairs\r\nconcerning the king, it was there by common consent agreed and ordained,\r\nthat the old seal of the office of the mayoralty of the city being very\r\nsmall, old, unapt, and uncomely for the honour of the city, should be\r\nbroken, and one other new should be had, which the said mayor commanded\r\nto be made artificially, and honourable for the exercise of the said\r\noffice thereafter, in place of the other; in which new seal, besides\r\nthe images of Peter and Paul, which of old were rudely engraven, there\r\nshould be under the feet of the said images a shield of the arms of the\r\nsaid city, perfectly graved,[184] with two lions supporting the same,\r\nwith two sergeants of arms; another part, one, and two tabernacles, in\r\nwhich above should stand two angels; between whom, above the said images\r\nof Peter and Paul, shall be set the glorious Virgin. This being done,\r\nthe old seal of the office was delivered to Richard Odiham, chamberlain,\r\nwho brake it, and in place thereof was delivered the new seal to the\r\nsaid mayor, to use in his office of mayoralty, as occasion should\r\nrequire. This new seal seemeth to be made before William Walworth was\r\nknighted, for he is not here entitled Sir, as afterwards he was; and\r\ncertain it is that the same new seal then made is now in use, and none\r\nother in that office of the mayoralty; which may suffice to answer the\r\nformer fable, without showing of any evidence sealed with the old seal,\r\nwhich was the cross and sword of St. Paul, and not the dagger of William\r\nWalworth.\r\n\r\nNow of other monuments in that church. Simon Mordon, mayor 1368, was\r\nburied there; John Olney, mayor 1446; Robert March, stock-fishmonger,\r\ngave two pieces of ground to be a churchyard; John Radwell,\r\nstock-fishmonger, buried 1415; George Gowre, esquire, son to\r\nEdward Gowre, stock-fishmonger, esquire, 1470; Alexander Purpoynt,\r\nstock-fishmonger, 1373; Andrew Burel, gentleman of Gray’s-inn, 1487;\r\nJohn Shrow, stock-fishmonger, 1487, with this epitaph:\r\n\r\n    “Farewell, my friends, the tide abideth no man,\r\n    I am departed hence, and so shall ye.\r\n    But in this passage the best song that I can,\r\n    Is _requiem æternam_, now Jesus grant it me,\r\n    When I have ended all mine adversitie,\r\n    Grant me in Paradise to have a mansion,\r\n    That sheddest thy blood for my redemption.”\r\n\r\nJohn Finkell, one of the sheriffs 1487, was knighted, and gave forty\r\npounds to this church, the one half for his monument. John Pattesley,\r\nmayor 1441; Thomas Ewen, grocer, bare half the charges in building of\r\nthe steeple, and was buried 1501; William Combes, gentleman, of Stoke,\r\nby Guilford in Surrey, 1502; Sir John Brudge, mayor 1530, gave fifty\r\npounds for a house called the College in Crooked lane; he lieth buried\r\nin St. Nicholas Hacon. Waltar Faireford; Robert Barre; Alexander Heyban;\r\nJohn Motte; John Gramstone; John Brampton; John Wood, stock-fishmonger,\r\n1531; Sir Henry Amcots, mayor 1548, etc. Hard by this St. Michael’s\r\nchurch, on the south side thereof, in the year 1560, on the fifth\r\nof July, through the shooting of a gun, which brake in the house of\r\none Adrian Arten, a Dutchman, and set fire on a firkin and barrel of\r\ngunpowder, four houses were blown up, and divers other sore shattered;\r\neleven men and women were slain, and sixteen so hurt and bruised, that\r\nthey hardly escaped with life.\r\n\r\nWest from this St. Michael’s lane is St. Martin Orgar lane, by\r\nCandlewick street, which lane is on both sides down to a well,\r\nreplenished with fair and large houses for merchants, and it is of\r\nthis ward; one of which houses was sometime called Beachamp’s inn, as\r\npertaining unto them of that family. Thomas Arundel, archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, commonly for his time was lodged there.\r\n\r\nThe parish church of St. Martin Orgar is a small thing. William Crowmer,\r\nmayor, built a proper chapel on the south side thereof, and was buried\r\nthere 1533; John Mathew, mayor 1490; Sir William Huet, mayor 1559, with\r\nhis lady and daughter, wife to Sir Edward Osburne; Ralph Tabinham,\r\nalderman; Alice, wife to Thomas Winslow; Thorudon; Benedicke Reding;\r\nThomas Harding; James Smith; Richard Gainford, esquire; John Bold, etc.\r\n\r\nThen is there one other lane called St. Laurence, of the parish church\r\nthere. This lane, down to the south side of the churchyard, is of\r\nCandlewick street ward. The parish church of St. Laurence was increased\r\nwith a chapel of Jesus by Thomas Cole, for a master and chaplain; the\r\nwhich chapel and parish church was made a college of Jesus and of Corpus\r\nChristi, for a master and seven chaplains, by John Poultney, mayor, and\r\nwas confirmed by Edward III., the 20th of his reign: of him was this\r\nchurch called St. Laurence Poultney, in Candlewick street; which college\r\nwas valued at £79 17_s._ 11_d._, and was surrendered in the reign of\r\nEdward VI. Robert Ratcliffe, Earl of Essex, and Henry Ratcliffe, Earl\r\nof Sussex, was buried there; Alderman Beswicke was buried there; John\r\nOliffe, alderman, Robert Browne, and others. Thus much for this ward,\r\nand the antiquities thereof. It hath now an alderman, his deputy, common\r\ncouncillors eight, constables eight, scavengers six, wardmote inquest\r\nmen twelve, and a beadle. It is taxed to the fifteen at sixteen pounds.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[176] “In London at fifty pounds, and in the Exchequer at forty-nine\r\npounds ten shillings.”--_1st edition_, p. 169.\r\n\r\n[177] “The king’s sons beaten to Eastcheape; there was no tavern then in\r\nEastcheape.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\n[178] “In Westcheape linen cloth sold, but no silks spoken of.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\n[179] “Fripparia, upholders upon Cornhill, sellers of old apparel and\r\nhousehold stuff in Eastcheape.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\nThe following is the stanza alluded to by Stow (see Lydgate’s _Minor\r\nPoems_).\r\n\r\n    “Then into Corn hyl anon I rode,\r\n    Where was much stolen gere amonge;\r\n    I saw where honge myne owne hoode,\r\n    That I had lost amonge the thronge:\r\n    To by my own hoode I thought it wronge;\r\n    I knew it well as I did my crede,\r\n    But for lack of money I could not spede.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[180] “Wike is a working place.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\n[181] “In Smithfield, and there to have been knighted by the king, but\r\nthat is not true.”--_1st edition_, p. 172.\r\n\r\n[182] “Fable of William Walworth and Jack Straw reproved.

It\r\nrunneth down Candlewick street west towards Budge row. It hath on the\r\nnorth side thereof St. Swithen’s lane, so called of St. Swithen, a\r\nparish church by London stone. This lane is replenished on both the\r\nsides with fair built houses, and is wholly of Walbrook ward.\r\n\r\nThe said parish church of St. Swithen standeth at the south-west corner\r\nof this lane. License was procured to new build and increase the said\r\nchurch and steeple in the year 1420. Sir John Hend, draper, mayor,\r\nwas an especial benefactor thereunto, as appeareth by his arms in the\r\nglass windows, even in the tops of them, which is in a field silver, a\r\nchief azure, a lion passant silver, a cheveron azure, three escalops\r\nsilver: he lieth buried in the body of this church, with a fair stone\r\nlaid on him, but the plates and inscriptions are defaced. Roger Depham,\r\nalderman, Thomas Aylesbourgh, William Neve, and Matilda Caxton, founded\r\nchantries, and were buried there; John Butler, draper, one of the\r\nsheriffs, 1420; Ralph Jecoline, mayor, a benefactor, buried in a fair\r\ntomb; William White, draper, one of the sheriffs, 1482, and other.\r\n\r\nOn the north side of this church and churchyard is one fair and large\r\nbuilt house, sometime pertaining to the prior of Tortington in Sussex,\r\nsince to the earls of Oxford, and now to Sir John Hart, alderman; which\r\nhouse hath a fair garden belonging thereunto, lying on the west side\r\nthereof. On the back side of two other fair houses in Walbrook, in the\r\nreign of Henry VII., Sir Richard Empson, knight, chancellor of the duchy\r\nof Lancaster, dwelt in the one of them, and Edmond Dudley, esquire, in\r\nthe other; either of them had a door of intercourse into this garden,\r\nwherein they met and consulted of matters at their pleasures. In this\r\nOxford place Sir Ambrose Nicholas kept his mayoralty, and since him the\r\nsaid Sir John Hart.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of this high street, near unto the channel, is pitched\r\nupright a great stone called London stone, fixed in the ground very\r\ndeep, fastened with bars of iron, and otherwise so strongly set, that if\r\ncarts do run against it through negligence, the wheels be broken, and\r\nthe stone itself unshaken.\r\n\r\nThe cause why this stone was set there, the time when, or other memory\r\nhereof, is none, but that the same hath long continued there is\r\nmanifest, namely, since (or rather before) the Conquest; for in the end\r\nof a fair written Gospel book given to Christ’s church in Canterburie,\r\nby Ethelstane, King of the West Saxons, I find noted of lands[185] or\r\nrents in London belonging to the said church, whereof one parcel is\r\ndescribed to lie near unto London stone. Of later time we read, that in\r\nthe year of Christ 1135, the 1st of King Stephen, a fire, which began\r\nin the house of one Ailward, near unto London stone, consumed all east\r\nto Aldgate, in the which fire the priory of the Holy Trinitie was burnt,\r\nand west to St. Erkenwald’s shrine in Paule’s church. And these be the\r\neldest notes that I read thereof.\r\n\r\nSome have said this stone to be set as a mark in the middle of the city\r\nwithin the walls; but in truth it standeth far nearer unto the river\r\nof Thames than to the wall of the city; some others have said the same\r\nto be set for the tendering and making of payment by debtors to their\r\ncreditors at their appointed days and times, till of later time payments\r\nwere more usually made at the font in Pont’s church, and now most\r\ncommonly at the Royal Exchange; some again have imagined the same to be\r\nset up by one John or Thomas Londonstone dwelling there against; but\r\nmore likely it is, that such men have taken name of the stone than the\r\nstone of them, as did John at Noke, Thomas at Stile, William at Wall, or\r\nat Well, etc.\r\n\r\nDown west from this parish church, and from London stone, have ye\r\nWalbrooke corner; from whence runneth up a street, north to the Stocks,\r\ncalled Walbrook, because it standeth on the east side of the same brook,\r\nby the bank thereof, and the whole ward taketh the name of that street.\r\nOn the east side of this street, and at the north corner thereof, is\r\nthe Stocks market, which had this beginning. About the year of Christ\r\n1282, Henry Wales, mayor, caused divers houses in this city to be built\r\ntowards the maintenance of London bridge, namely, one void place near\r\nunto the parish church called Woole church, on the north side thereof,\r\nwhere sometime (the way being very large and broad) had stood a pair of\r\nstocks for punishment of offenders; this building took name of these\r\nstocks, and was appointed by him to be a market place for fish and flesh\r\nin the midst of the city. Other houses he built in other places, as by\r\nthe patent of Edward I. it doth appear, dated the 10th of his reign.\r\nAfter this, in the year 1322, the 17th of Edward II., a decree was\r\nmade by Hamond Chickwell, mayor, that none should sell fish or flesh\r\nout of the markets appointed, to wit, Bridge street, East Cheape, Old\r\nFish street, St. Nicholas’ shambles, and the said Stocks, upon pain to\r\nforfeit such fish or flesh as were sold, for the first time, and the\r\nsecond time to lose their freedom; which act was made by commandment\r\nof the king under his letters patent, dated at the Tower the 17th of\r\nhis reign, and then was this stocks let to farm for £46 13_s._ 4_d._ by\r\nyear. This Stocks market was again begun to be built in the year 1410,\r\nin the 11th of Henry IV., and was finished in the year next following.\r\nIn the year 1507, the same was rented £56 19_s._ 10_d._ And in the year\r\n1543, John Cotes being mayor, there were in this Stocks market for\r\nfishmongers twenty-five boards or stalls, rented yearly to £34 13_s._\r\n4_d._, there were for butchers eighteen boards or stalls, rented at £41\r\n16_s._ 4_d._, and there were also chambers above, sixteen, rented at £5\r\n13_s._ 4_d._, in all £82 3_s._\r\n\r\nNext unto this Stocks is the parish church of St. Mary Wool church, so\r\ncalled of a beam placed in the churchyard, which was thereof called\r\nWool church haw, of the tronage, or weighing of wool there used; and to\r\nverify this, I find amongst the customs of London, written in French in\r\nthe reign of Edward II., a chapter intituled _Les Customes de Wolchurch\r\nHaw_, wherein is set down what was there to be paid for every parcel of\r\nwool weighed. This tronage or weighing of wool, till the 6th of Richard\r\nII., was there continued; John Churchman then built the Customhouse\r\nupon Wool key, to serve for the said tronage, as is before showed in\r\nTower street ward. This church is reasonable fair and large, and was\r\nlately new built by license granted in the 20th of Henry VI., with\r\ncondition to be built fifteen foot from the Stocks market, for sparing\r\nof light to the same Stocks. The parson of this church is to have four\r\nmarks the year for tithe of the said Stocks, paid him by the masters\r\nof the Bridge house, by special decree made the 2nd of Henry VII. John\r\nWinyar, grocer, mayor 1504, was a great helper to the building of this\r\nchurch, and was there buried 1505; he gave unto it by his testament two\r\nlarge basons of silver, and twenty pounds in money. Also Richard Shore,\r\ndraper, one of the sheriffs 1505, was a great benefactor in his life,\r\nand by his testament gave twenty pounds to make a porch at the west\r\nend thereof, and was there buried; Richard Hatfield of Steplemorden in\r\nCambridgeshire, lieth entombed there, 1467; Edward Deoly, esquire, 1467.\r\nJohn Handford, grocer, made the font of that church, very curiously\r\nwrought, painted, and gilded, and was there buried; John Archer,\r\nfishmonger, 1487; Anne Cawode founded a chantry there, etc.\r\n\r\nFrom the Stocks’ market and this parish church east up into Lombard\r\nstreet, some four or five houses on a side, and also on the south side\r\nof Wool church, have ye Bearbinder lane, a part whereof is of this\r\nWalbrooke ward; then lower down in the street called Walbrooke, is one\r\nother fair church of St. Stephen, lately built on the east side thereof,\r\nfor the old church stood on the west side, in place where now standeth\r\nthe parsonage house, and therefore so much nearer the brook, even on\r\nthe bank. Robert Chichley, mayor in the year 1428, the 6th of Henry\r\nVI., gave to this parish of St. Stephen one plot of ground, containing\r\ntwo hundred and eight feet and a half in length, and sixty-six feet in\r\nbreadth, thereupon to build their new church, and for their churchyard;\r\nand in the 7th of Henry VI. the said Robert, one of the founders, laid\r\nthe first stone for himself, the second for William Stoddon, mayor, with\r\nwhose goods the ground that the church standeth on, and the housing,\r\nwith the ground of the churchyard, was bought by the said Chichley for\r\ntwo hundred marks from the Grocers, which had been letten before for\r\nsix-and-twenty marks the year; Robert Whittingham, draper, laid the\r\nthird stone, Henry Barton then mayor, etc. The said Chichley gave more,\r\none hundred pounds to the said work, and bare the charges of all the\r\ntimber work on the procession way, and laid the lead upon it of his\r\nown cost; he also gave all the timber for the roofing of the two side\r\naisles, and paid for the carriage thereof. This church was finished in\r\nthe year 1439; the breadth thereof is sixty-seven feet, and length one\r\nhundred and twenty-five feet, the churchyard ninety feet in length, and\r\nthirty-seven in breadth and more. Robert Whittingham (made Knight of the\r\nBath), in the year 1432, purchased the patronage of this church from\r\nJohn Duke of Bedford, uncle to Henry VI., and Edward IV., in the 2nd of\r\nhis reign, gave it to Richard Lee, then mayor. There be monuments in\r\nthis church of Thomas Southwell, first parson of this new church, who\r\nlieth in the choir; John Dunstable, master of astronomy and music, in\r\nthe year 1453; Sir Richard Lee, mayor, who gave the said parsonage to\r\nthe Grocers; Rowland Hill, mayor 1549; Sir Thomas Pope, first treasurer\r\nof the augmentations, with his wife Dame Margaret; Sir John Cootes,\r\nmayor 1542; Sir John Yorke, knight, merchant-tailor, 1549; Edward\r\nJackman, sheriff 1564; Richard Achley, grocer; Dr. Owyn, physician to\r\nKing Henry VIII.; John Kirby, grocer, 1578; and others.\r\n\r\nLower down from this parish church be divers fair houses, namely, one\r\nwherein of late Sir Richard Baker, a knight of Kent, was lodged, and\r\nwherein dwelt Master Thomas Gore, a merchant famous for hospitality.\r\nOn the west side of this Walbrooke street, over against the Stocks’\r\nmarket, is a part of the high street called the Poultrie, on the south\r\nside west till over against St. Mildrede’s church, and the Skalding wike\r\nis of this ward. Then down again Walbrooke street some small distance,\r\nis Buckles bury, a street so called of Buckle, that sometime was owner\r\nthereof, part of which street on both sides, three or four houses,\r\nto the course of the brook, is of this ward, and so down Walbrooke\r\nstreet to the south corner; from thence west down Budge row some small\r\ndistance, to an alley, and through that alley south by the west end of\r\nSt. John’s church upon Walbrooke, by the south side and east end of the\r\nsame again to Walbrooke corner.\r\n\r\nThis parish church is called St. John upon Walbrooke, because the west\r\nend thereof is on the very bank of Walbrooke, by Horseshew bridge, in\r\nHorseshew bridge street. This church was also lately new built; for\r\nabout the year 1412, license was granted by the mayor and commonalty to\r\nthe parson and parish, for enlarging thereof, with a piece of ground on\r\nthe north part of the choir, twenty-one feet in length, seventeen feet\r\nand three inches in breadth, and on the south side of the choir one\r\nfoot of the common soil. There be no monuments in this church of any\r\naccount, only I have learned, William Cobarton, skinner, who gave lands\r\nto that church, was there buried 1410, and John Stone, tailor, one of\r\nthe sheriffs 1464, was likewise buried there.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of Walbrooke ward, from Candlewicke street, in the\r\nmid way betwixt London stone and Walbrooke corner, is a little lane\r\nwith a turnpike in the midst thereof, and in the same a proper parish\r\nchurch, called St. Mary Bothaw, or Boatehaw by the Erber; this church\r\nbeing near unto the Downegate on the river of Thames, hath the addition\r\nof Boathaw or Boat haw, of near adjoining to a haw or yard, wherein of\r\nold time boats were made, and landed from Downegate to be mended, as may\r\nbe supposed, for other reason I find none why it should be so called.\r\nWithin this church, and the small cloister adjoining, divers noblemen\r\nand persons of worship have been buried, as appeareth by arms in the\r\nwindows, the defaced tombs, and print of plates torn up and carried\r\naway: there remain only of John West, esquire, buried in the year 1408;\r\nThomas Huytley, esquire, 1539, but his monument is defaced since;\r\nLancelot Bathurst, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Erbar is an ancient place so called, but not of Walbrooke ward, and\r\ntherefore out of that lane to Walbrooke corner, and then down till over\r\nagainst the south corner of St. John’s church upon Walbrooke. And this\r\nis all that I can say of Walbrooke ward. It hath an alderman, and his\r\ndeputy, common councillors eleven, constables nine, scavengers six, for\r\nthe wardmote inquest thirteen, and a beadle. It is taxed to the fifteen\r\nin London to £33 5_s._[186]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[185] Liber Trinitate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOWNEGATE WARD\r\n\r\n\r\nDownegate ward beginneth at the south end of Walbrooke ward over against\r\nthe east corner of St. John’s church upon Walbrooke, and descendeth on\r\nboth the sides to Downegate on the Thames, and is so called of that down\r\ngoing or descending thereunto; and of this Downgate the ward taketh\r\nname. This ward turneth into Thames street westward, some ten houses on\r\na side to the course of Walbrooke, but east in Thames street on both\r\nsides to Ebgate lane, or Old Swan, the land side whereof hath many lanes\r\nturning up, as shall be shown when I come to them.\r\n\r\nBut first to begin with the high street called Dowgate; at the upper\r\nend thereof is a fair conduit of Thames water, castellated, and made in\r\nthe year 1568, at charges of the citizens, and is called the conduit\r\nupon Downegate. The descent of this street is such, that in the year\r\n1574, on the 4th of September, in the afternoon, there fell a storm of\r\nrain, where through the channels suddenly arose, and ran with such a\r\nswift course towards the common shores, that a lad of eighteen years\r\nold, minding to have leapt over the channel near unto the said conduit,\r\nwas taken with the stream, and carried from thence towards the Thames\r\nwith such a violence, that no man with staves or otherwise could stay\r\nhim, till he came against a cart wheel that stood in the said watergate,\r\nbefore which time he was drowned, and stark dead.\r\n\r\nOn the west side of this street is the Tallow-chandlers’ hall, a proper\r\nhouse, which company was incorporated in the 2nd year of Edward IV.\r\n\r\nSomewhat lower standeth the Skinners’ hall, a fair house, which was\r\nsometime called Copped hall, by Downegate, in the parish of St. John\r\nupon Walbrooke. In the 19th year of Edward II., Ralph Cobham possessed\r\nit with five shops, etc.\r\n\r\nThis company of Skinners in London were incorporate by Edward III. in\r\nthe 1st of his reign; they had two brotherhoods of Corpus Christi,\r\nviz. one at St. Mary Spittle, the other at St. Mary Bethlem without\r\nBishopsgate. Richard II., in the 18th of his reign, granted them to make\r\ntheir two brotherhoods one, by the name of the fraternity of Corpus\r\nChristi. Of Skinners, divers royal persons were named to be founders\r\nand brethren of this fraternity, to wit, kings six, dukes nine, earls\r\ntwo, lords one. Kings, Edward III., Richard II., Henry IV., Henry V.,\r\nHenry VI., and Edward IV. This fraternity had also once every year, on\r\nCorpus Christi day afternoon, a procession passed through the principal\r\nstreets of the city, wherein was borne more than one hundred torches\r\nof wax (costly garnished) burning light, and above two hundred clerks\r\nand priests, in surplices and copes, singing. After the which were\r\nthe sheriffs’ servants, the clerks of the compters, chaplains for the\r\nsheriffs, the mayor’s sergeants, the counsel of the city, the mayor and\r\naldermen in scarlet, and then the Skinners in their best liveries. Thus\r\nmuch to stop the tongues of unthankful men, such as used to ask, Why\r\nhave ye not noted this, or that? and give no thanks for what is done.\r\n\r\nThen lower down was a challenge of priests, called Jesus’ Commons, a\r\nhouse well furnished with brass, pewter, napery, plate, etc., besides a\r\nfair library well stored with books, all which of old time was given to\r\na number of priests that should keep commons there, and as one left his\r\nplace, by death or otherwise, another should be admitted into his room,\r\nbut this order within this thirty years being discontinued, the said\r\nhouse was dissolved and turned to tenements.\r\n\r\nDown lower have ye Elbow lane; and at the corner thereof was one\r\ngreat stone house, called Olde hall; it is now taken down, and divers\r\nfair houses of timber placed there. This was sometime pertaining to\r\nWilliam de Pont le Arch, and by him given to the priory of St. Mary\r\nOvery in Southwark, in the reign of Henry I. In this Elbow lane is\r\nthe Innholders’ hall, and other fair houses; this lane runneth west,\r\nand suddenly turneth south into Thames street, and therefore of that\r\nbending is called Elbow lane. On the east side of this Downegate street\r\nis the great old house before spoken of, called the Erber, near to\r\nthe church of St. Mary Bothaw; Geffrey Scroope held it by the gift of\r\nEdward III., in the 14th of his reign; it belonged since to John Nevell,\r\nLord of Rabie, then to Richard Nevell, Earl of Warwick; Nevell, Earl\r\nof Salisburie, was lodged there 1457; then it came to George Duke of\r\nClarence, and his heirs male, by the gift of Edward IV., in the 14th of\r\nhis reign. It was lately new built by Sir Thomas Pullison, mayor, and\r\nwas afterward inhabited by Sir Francis Drake, that famous mariner. Next\r\nto this great house is a lane turning to Bush lane (of old time called\r\nCarter lane, of carts and carmen having stables there), and now called\r\nChequer lane, or Chequer alley, of an inn called the Chequer.\r\n\r\nIn Thames street, on the Thames side, west from Downegate, is Greenewich\r\nlane, of old time so called, and now Frier lane, of such a sign there\r\nset up. In this lane is the Joiners’ hall, and other fair houses.\r\n\r\nThen is Grantham’s lane, so called of John Grantham, sometime mayor, and\r\nowner thereof, whose house was very large and strong, built of stone, as\r\nappeareth by gates arched, yet remaining. Ralph Dodmer, first a brewer,\r\nthen a mercer, mayor 1529, dwelt there, and kept his mayoralty in that\r\nhouse; it is now a brewhouse as it was afore.\r\n\r\nThen is Dowgate, whereof is spoken in another place. East from this\r\nDowgate is Cosin lane, named of William Cosin that dwelt there in the\r\n4th of Richard II., as divers his predecessors, father, grandfather,\r\netc. had done before him. William Cosin was one of the sheriffs in the\r\nyear 1306. That house standeth at the south end of the lane, having an\r\nold and artificial conveyance of Thames water into it, and is now a\r\ndyehouse called Lambard’s messuage. Adjoining to that house there was\r\nlately erected an engine to convey Thames water unto Downegate conduit\r\naforesaid.\r\n\r\nNext to this lane, on the east, is the Steelyard, as they term it, a\r\nplace for merchants of Almaine, that used to bring hither as well wheat,\r\nrye, and other grain, as cables, ropes, masts, pitch, tar, flax, hemp,\r\nlinen cloth, wainscots, wax, steel, and other profitable merchandises.\r\nUnto these merchants, in the year 1259, Henry III., at the request of\r\nhis brother Richard, Earl of Cornewell, king of Almaine, granted that\r\nall and singular the merchants, having a house in the city of London,\r\ncommonly called _Guilda Aula Theutonicorum_, should be maintained\r\nand upholden through the whole realm, by all such freedoms, and free\r\nusages, or liberties, as by the king and his noble progenitors’ time\r\nthey had and enjoyed, etc. Edward I. renewed and confirmed that charter\r\nof liberties granted by his father. And in the 10th year of the same\r\nEdward, Henry Wales being mayor, a great controversy did arise between\r\nthe said mayor, and the merchants of the Haunce of Almaine, about the\r\nreparations of Bishopsgate, then likely to fall, for that the said\r\nmerchants enjoyed divers privileges in respect of maintaining the said\r\ngate, which they now denied to repair; for the appeasing of which\r\ncontroversy the king sent his writ to the treasurer and barons of his\r\nExchequer, commanding that they should make inquisition thereof; before\r\nwhom the merchants being called, when they were not able to discharge\r\nthemselves, sith they enjoyed the liberties to them granted for the\r\nsame, a precept was sent to the mayor and sheriffs to distrain the\r\nsaid merchants to make reparations, namely, Gerard Marbod, alderman of\r\nthe Haunce, Ralph de Cussarde, a citizen of Colen, Ludero de Denevar,\r\na burgess of Trivar, John of Aras, a burgess of Trivon, Bartram of\r\nHamburdge, Godestalke of Hundondale, a burgess of Trivon, John de Dele,\r\na burgess of Munstar, then remaining in the said city of London, for\r\nthemselves and all other merchants of the Haunce, and so they granted\r\ntwo hundred and ten marks sterling to the mayor and citizens, and\r\nundertook that they and their successors should from time to time repair\r\nthe said gate, and bear the third part of the charges in money and men\r\nto defend it when need were. And for this agreement the said mayor and\r\ncitizens granted to the said merchants their liberties, which till of\r\nlate they have enjoyed, as namely, amongst other, that they might lay\r\nup their grain which they brought into this realm in inns, and sell it\r\nin their garners, by the space of forty days after they had laid it\r\nup, except by the mayor and citizens they were expressly forbidden,\r\nbecause of dearth, or other reasonable occasions. Also they might have\r\ntheir aldermen as they had been accustomed, foreseeing always that he\r\nwere of the city, and presented to the mayor and aldermen of the city,\r\nso oft as any should be chosen, and should take an oath before them to\r\nmaintain justice in their courts, and to behave themselves in their\r\noffice according to law, and as it stood with the customs of the city.\r\nThus much for their privileges; whereby it appeareth that they were\r\ngreat merchants of corn brought out of the east parts hither, insomuch\r\nthat the occupiers of husbandry in this land were inforced to complain\r\nof them for bringing in such abundance when the corn of this realm was\r\nat such an easy price; whereupon it was ordained by parliament, that no\r\nperson should bring into any part of this realm, by way of merchandise,\r\nwheat, rye, or barley, growing out of the said realm, when the quarter\r\nof wheat exceed not the price of 6_s._ 8_d._, rye 4_s._ the quarter, and\r\nbarley 3_s._ the quarter, upon forfeiture the one half to the king, the\r\nother half to the seizor thereof. These merchants of Haunce had their\r\nGuildhall in Thames street in place aforesaid by the said Cosin lane.\r\nTheir hall is large built of stone, with three arched gates towards the\r\nstreet, the middlemost whereof is far bigger than the other, and is\r\nseldom opened, the other two be mured up; the same is now called the\r\nold hall.\r\n\r\nOf later time, to wit, in the 6th of Richard II., they hired one house\r\nnext adjoining to their old hall, which sometime belonged to Richard\r\nLions, a famous lapidary, one of the sheriffs of London in the 49th of\r\nEdward III., and in the 4th of Richard II., by the rebels of Kent, drawn\r\nout of that house and beheaded in West Cheap. This also was a great\r\nhouse with a large wharf on the Thames, and the way thereunto was called\r\nWindgoose, or Wildgoose lane, which is now called Windgoose alley,\r\nfor that the same alley is for the most part built on by the stilyard\r\nmerchants.\r\n\r\nThe abbot of St. Alban’s had a messuage here with a key, given to him\r\nin the 34th of Henry VI. Then is one other great house, which sometime\r\npertained to John Rainwell, stockfish-monger, mayor, and it was by\r\nhim given to the mayor and commonalty, to the end that the profits\r\nthereof should be disposed in deeds of piety; which house, in the\r\n15th of Edward IV., was confirmed unto the said merchants, in manner\r\nfollowing, namely:--“It is ordayned by our soveraigne lord and his\r\nparliament, that the said marchants of Almaine, being of the companie\r\ncalled the _Guildhall Teutonicorum_ (or the Flemish gild), that now be,\r\nor hereafter shall be, shall have, hold, and enjoy, to them and their\r\nsuccessors for ever, the said place called the Steel house, yeelding to\r\nthe said mayor and communaltie an annuall rent of £70 3_s._ 4_d._ etc.”\r\n\r\nIn the year 1551, and the 5th of Edward VI., through complaint of the\r\nEnglish merchants, the liberty of the steelyard merchants was seized\r\ninto the king’s hands, and so it resteth.\r\n\r\nThen is Church lane, at the west end of Alhallowes church, called\r\nAlhallowes the More in Thames street, for a difference from Alhallowes\r\nthe Less in the same street; it is also called Alhallowes _ad fœnum_ in\r\nthe Ropery, because hay sold near thereunto at Hay wharf, and ropes of\r\nold time made and sold in the high street. This is a fair church, with\r\na large cloister on the south side thereof about their churchyard, but\r\nfoully defaced and ruinated.\r\n\r\nThe church also hath had many fair monuments, but now defaced. There\r\nremaineth in the choir some plates on grave stones--namely, of William\r\nLichfield, D.D., who deceased the year 1447: he was a great student,\r\nand compiled many books, both moral and divine, in prose and in verse,\r\nnamely, one intituled _The Complaint of God unto Sinful Man_. He made\r\nin his time three thousand and eighty-three sermons, as appeared by\r\nhis own handwriting, and were found when he was dead. One other plate\r\nthere is of John Brickles, draper, who deceased in the year 1451; he was\r\na great benefactor to that church, and gave by his testament certain\r\ntenements to the relief of the poor, etc. Nicholas Loven and William\r\nPeston founded chantries there.\r\n\r\nAt the east end of this church goeth down a lane called Hay wharf lane,\r\nnow lately a great brewhouse, built there by one Pot; Henry Campion,\r\nesquire, a beer-brewer, used it, and Abraham his son now possesseth it.\r\nThen was there one other lane, sometime called Woolfe’s gate, now out of\r\nuse; for the lower part thereof upon the bank of Thames is built by the\r\nlate Earl of Shrewsburie, and the other end is built on and stopped up\r\nby the chamberlain of London. John Butler, draper, one of the sheriffs\r\nin the year 1420, dwelt there; he appointed his house to be sold, and\r\nthe price thereof to be given to the poor: it was of Alhallowes parish\r\nthe less. Then is there the said parish church of Alhallowes called the\r\nLess, and by some Alhallowes on the Cellars, for it standeth on vaults;\r\nit is said to be built by Sir John Poultney, sometime mayor. The steeple\r\nand choir of this church standeth on an arched gate, being the entry\r\nto a great house called Cold Harbrough. The choir of late being fallen\r\ndown, is now again at length, in the year 1594, by the parishioners new\r\nbuilt. Touching this Cold Harbrough, I find, that in the 13th of Edward\r\nII., Sir John Abel, knight, demised or let unto Henry Stow, draper, all\r\nthat his capital messuage called the Cold Harbrough, in the parish of\r\nAll Saints _ad fœnum_, and all the appurtenances within the gate, with\r\nthe key which Robert Hartford, citizen, son to William Hartford, had,\r\nand ought; and the foresaid Robert paid for it the rent of thirty-three\r\nshillings the year. This Robert Hartford being owner thereof, as also\r\nof other lands in Surrey, deceasing without issue male, left two\r\ndaughters his coheirs, to wit, Idonia, married to Sir Ralph Bigot, and\r\nMaude, married to Sir Stephen Cosenton, knights, between whom the said\r\nhouse and lands were parted. After the which, John Bigot, son to the\r\nsaid Sir Ralph, and Sir John Cosenton, did sell their moieties of Cold\r\nHarbrough unto John Poultney, son of Adam Poultney, the 8th of Edward\r\nIII. This Sir John Poultney dwelling in this house, and being four times\r\nmayor, the said house took the name of Poultney’s inn. Notwithstanding\r\nthis, Sir John Poultney, the 21st of Edward III., by his charter, gave\r\nand confirmed to Humfrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford and Essex, his\r\nwhole tenement called Cold Harbrough, with all the tenements and key\r\nadjoining, and appurtenances, sometime pertaining to Robert de Hereford,\r\non the way called Hay wharf lane, etc., for one rose at Midsummer, to\r\nhim and to his heirs for all services, if the same were demanded. This\r\nSir John Poultney, deceased 1349, and left issue, by Margaret his wife,\r\nWilliam Poultney, who died without issue, and Margaret his mother was\r\nmarried to Sir Nicholas Lovel, knight, etc. Philip S. Cleare gave two\r\nmessuages pertaining to this Cold Harbrough in the Roperie, towards the\r\nenlarging of the parish church and churchyard of All Saints, called the\r\nLess, in the 20th of Richard II.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1397, the 21st of Richard II., John Holland, Earl of\r\nHuntingdon, was lodged there, and Richard II., his brother dined with\r\nhim: it was then counted a right fair and stately house; but in the next\r\nyear following I find that Edmond, Earl of Cambridge, was there lodged,\r\nnotwithstanding the said house still retained the name of Poultney’s\r\ninn, in the reign of Henry VI., the 26th of his reign. It belonged since\r\nto H. Holland, Duke of Excester, and he was lodged there in the year\r\n1472. In the year 1485, Richard III., by his letters patent, granted and\r\ngave to John Writh, alias Garter, principal king of arms of Englishmen,\r\nand to the rest of the king’s heralds and pursuivants of arms, all that\r\nmessuage, with the appurtenances, called Cold Harbrough, in the parish\r\nof All Saints the Little in London, and their successors for ever. Dated\r\nat Westminster the 2nd of March, _anno regni primo_, without fine or\r\nfee. How the said heralds departed therewith I have not read; but in the\r\nreign of Henry VIII. the Bishop of Durham’s house near Charing cross,\r\nbeing taken into the king’s hand, Cuthbert Tunstal, Bishop of Durham,\r\nwas lodged in this Cold Harbrough; since the which time it hath belonged\r\nto the Earls of Shrewsburie, by composition (as is supposed) from the\r\nsaid Cuthbert Tunstall. The last deceased earl took it down, and in\r\nplace thereof built a great number of small tenements, now letten out\r\nfor great rents to people of all sorts.\r\n\r\nThen is the Dyers’ hall, which company was made a brotherhood or guild,\r\nin the 4th of Henry VI., and appointed to consist of a guardian or\r\nwarden, and a commonalty, the 12th of Edward IV. Then be there divers\r\nlarge brewhouses and others, till you come to Ebgate lane, where that\r\nward endeth in the east. On the north side of Thames street be divers\r\nlanes also; the first is at the south end of Elbow lane, before spoken\r\nof, west from Downegate, over against Greenwich lane: then be divers\r\nfair houses for merchants and others all along that side. The next lane\r\neast from Downegate is called Bush lane, which turneth up to Candlewicke\r\nstreet, and is of Downegate ward. Next is Suffolke lane, likewise\r\nturning up to Candlewicke street. In this lane is one notable grammar\r\nschool, founded in the year 1561 by the master, wardens, and assistants\r\nof the Merchant-Tailors, in the parish of St. Laurence Poultney; Richard\r\nHilles, sometime master of that company, having before given £500\r\ntowards the purchase of a house, called the manor of the Rose, sometime\r\nbelonging to the Duke of Buckingham, wherein the said school is kept.\r\nThen is there one other lane which turneth up to St. Laurence hill, and\r\nto the south-west corner of St. Laurence churchyard; then one other\r\nlane called Poultney lane, that goeth up of this ward to the south-east\r\ncorner of St. Laurence churchyard, and so down again, and to the west\r\ncorner of St. Martin Orgar lane, and over against Ebgate lane; and this\r\nis all of Downgate ward, the thirteenth in number lying east from the\r\nwater-course of Walbrook, and hath not any one house on the west side\r\nof the said brook. It hath an alderman, his deputy, common councillors\r\nnine, constables eight, scavengers five, for the wardmote inquest\r\nfourteen, and a beadle. It is taxed to the fifteen eight-and-twenty\r\npounds.[187]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[186] “In London to forty pound, and in the Exchequer to thirty-nine\r\npound.”--_1st edition_, p. 181.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWARDS ON THE WEST SIDE OF WALBROOKE, AND FIRST OF VINTRY WARD\r\n\r\n\r\nNow I am to speak of the other wards, twelve in number, all lying on\r\nthe west side of the course of Walbrooke. And first of Vintry ward, so\r\ncalled of vintners, and of the vintry, a part of the bank of the river\r\nof Thames, where the merchants of Burdeaux craned their wines out of\r\nlighters and other vessels, and there landed and made sale of them\r\nwithin forty days after, until the 28th of Edward I., at which time\r\nthe said merchants complained that they could not sell their wines,\r\npaying poundage, neither hire houses or cellars to lay them in; and it\r\nwas redressed by virtue of the king’s writ, directed to the mayor and\r\nsheriffs of London, dated at Carlaveroke, or Carlisle, since the which\r\ntime many fair and large houses, with vaults and cellars for stowage of\r\nwines, and lodging of the Burdeaux merchants have been built in place\r\nwhere before time were cooks’ houses; for Fitzstephen, in the reign\r\nof Henry II., writeth, that upon the river’s side, between the wine\r\nin ships, and the wine to be sold in taverns, was a common cookery\r\nor cooks’ row, etc., as in another place I have set down; whereby it\r\nappeareth, that in those days (and till of late time) every man lived by\r\nhis professed trade, not any one interrupting another: the cooks dressed\r\nmeat, and sold no wine, and the taverner sold wine, but dressed no meat\r\nfor sale, etc.\r\n\r\nThis ward beginneth in the east at the west end of Downegate ward, as\r\nthe water-course of Walbrooke parteth them, to wit, at Grantham’s lane,\r\non the Thames side, and at Elbow lane on the land side; it runneth\r\nalong in Thames street west some three houses beyond the Old Swanne, a\r\nbrewhouse, and on the land side some three houses west beyond St. James’\r\nat Garlicke Hith. In breadth this ward stretcheth from the Vintry, north\r\nto the wall of the west gate of the Tower Royall; the other north part\r\nis of Cordwayner street ward. Out of this Royal street, by the south\r\ngate of Tower Royall, runneth a small street east to St. John’s upon\r\nWalbrooke, which street is called Horshew bridge, of such a bridge\r\nsometime over the brook there, which is now vaulted over. Then from the\r\nsaid south gate west, runneth one other street, called Knightriders’\r\nstreet, by St. Thomas Apostle’s church on the north side, and Wringwren\r\nlane by the said church, at the west end thereof, and to the east end\r\nof the Trinitie church in the said Knightriders’ street, where this\r\nward endeth on that south side the street; but on the north side it\r\nrunneth no further than the corner against the new built tavern and\r\nother houses, in a plot of ground where sometime stood Ormond place;\r\nyet have ye one other lane lower down in Royall street, stretching from\r\nover against St. Michael’s church, to, and by the north side of St.\r\nJames’ church by Garlicke Hith; this is called Kerion lane. And thus\r\nmuch for the bounds of Vintry ward. Now, on the Thames’ side, west from\r\nGrantham’s lane, have ye Herber lane, or Brikels’ lane, so called of\r\nJohn Brikels, sometime owner thereof.\r\n\r\nThen is Simpson’s lane, of one Simpson, or Emperor’s head lane, of such\r\na sign. Then the Three Cranes’ lane, so called not only of a sign of\r\nthree cranes at a tavern door, but rather of three strong cranes of\r\ntimber placed on the Vintry wharf by the Thames side, to crane up wines\r\nthere, as is afore showed. This lane was of old time, to wit, the 9th of\r\nRichard II., called The Painted Tavern lane, of the tavern being painted.\r\n\r\nThen next over against St. Martin’s church, is a large house built of\r\nstone and timber, with vaults for the stowage of wines, and is called\r\nthe Vintry. There dwelt John Gisers, vintner, mayor of London, and\r\nconstable of the Tower, and then was Henry Picard, vintner, mayor.\r\nIn this house Henry Picard feasted four kings in one day (as in my\r\n_Summary_ I have showed). Then next is Vanner’s lane, so called of one\r\nVanner that was owner thereof; it is now called Church lane, of the\r\ncoming up from the wharf to St. Martin’s church. Next is Brode lane,\r\nfor that the same is broader for the passage of carts from the Vintrie\r\nwharf, than be the other lanes. At the north-west corner of this lane is\r\nthe Parish Clerks’ hall, lately by them purchased, since they lost their\r\nold hall in Bishopsgate street. Next is Spittle lane, of old time so\r\ncalled, since Stodie’s lane, of the owner thereof named Stodie. Sir John\r\nStodie, vintner, mayor in the year 1357, gave it with all the quadrant\r\nwherein Vintners’ hall now standeth, with the tenements round about unto\r\nthe Vintners; the Vintners built for themselves a fair hall, and also\r\nthirteen alms houses there for thirteen poor people, which are kept of\r\ncharity rent free.\r\n\r\nThe Vintners in London were of old time called Merchant-vintners of\r\nGascoyne; and so I read them in the records of Edward II., the 11th\r\nyear, and Edward III., the 9th year: they were as well Englishmen as\r\nstrangers born beyond the seas, but then subjects to the kings of\r\nEngland, great Burdeaux merchants of Gascoyne and French wines, divers\r\nof them were mayors of this city, namely John Adrian, vintner, Reginold\r\nat conduit, John Oxenford, Hen. Picard, that feasted the kings of\r\nEngland, France, Scotland, and Cypres, John Stodie, that gave Stodie’s\r\nlane to the Vintners; which four last named were mayors in the reign of\r\nEdward III.; and yet Gascoyne wines were then to be sold at London not\r\nabove four pence, nor Rhenish wine above six pence the gallon. I read of\r\nsweet wines, that in the 50th of Edward III., John Peachie, fishmonger,\r\nwas accused, for that he procured a license for the only sale of them\r\nin London; which notwithstanding he justified by law, he was imprisoned\r\nand fined. More, I read, that in the 6th of Henry VI., the Lombards\r\ncorrupting their sweet wines, when knowledge thereof came to John\r\nRainwell, mayor of London, he in divers places of the city commanded the\r\nheads of the butts and other vessels in the open streets to be broken,\r\nto the number of one hundred and fifty, so that the liquor running\r\nforth, passed through the city like a stream of rain water, in the sight\r\nof all the people, from whence there issued a most loathsome savour.\r\n\r\nI read, in the reign of Henry VII., that no sweet wines were brought\r\ninto this realm but Malmesies by the Longabards, paying to the king\r\nfor his license six shillings and eight pence of every butt, besides\r\ntwelve pence for bottle large. I remember within this fifty-four years\r\nMalmsey not to be sold more than one penny halfpenny the pint. For proof\r\nwhereof, it appeareth in the church book of St. Andrew Undershafte, that\r\nin the year 1547 I. G. and S. K., then churchwardens, for eighty pints\r\nof Malmsey spent in the church, after one penny halfpenny the pint, paid\r\nat the year’s end for the same ten shillings. More, I remember that no\r\nsacks were sold but Rumney, and that for medicine more than for drink,\r\nbut now many kinds of sacks are known and used. And so much for wines.\r\n\r\nFor the Vintry, to end therewith, I read, that in the reign of Henry\r\nIV., the young prince Henry, Thomas Duke of Clarence, John Duke of\r\nBedford, and Humfrey Duke of Glocester, the king’s sons, being at supper\r\namong the merchants of London in the Vintry, in the house of Lewes John,\r\nHenry Scogan sent to them a ballad beginning thus:--\r\n\r\n    “My noble sonnes and eke my lords deare,\r\n    I your father, called unworthily,\r\n    Send unto you this ballad following here,\r\n    Written with mine own hand full rudely,\r\n    Although it be that I not reverently\r\n    Have written to your estates, I you pray\r\n    Mine uncunning, taketh benignely,\r\n    For God’s sake, and hearken what I say.”\r\n\r\nThen follow in like metre twenty-three staves, containing a persuasion\r\nfrom losing of time follily in lust and vice, but to spend the same\r\nin virtue and godliness, as ye may read in Geffrey Chawcer’s works\r\nlately printed. The successors of those vintners and wine-drawers, that\r\nretailed by the gallons, pottle, quart, and pint, were all incorporated\r\nby the name of Wine-tunners[188] in the reign of Edward III., and\r\nconfirmed in the 15th of Henry VI.\r\n\r\nNext is Palmer’s lane, now called Anchor lane; the Plumbers have their\r\nhall there, but are tenants to the Vintners. Then is Worcester house,\r\nsometime belonging to the Earls of Worcester, now divided into many\r\ntenements; the Fruiterers have their hall there. Then is the Old Swan, a\r\ngreat brewhouse. And this is all on the Thames’ side that I can note in\r\nthis ward.\r\n\r\nOn the land side is the Royall street and Paternoster lane, I think\r\nof old time called Arches; for I read that Robert de Suffolke gave to\r\nWalter Darford his tenement with the appurtenance in the lane called Les\r\nArches, in the parish of St. Michael de Paternoster church, between the\r\nwall of the field called Winchester field on the east, and the same lane\r\non the West, etc. More, I read of a stone house called Sto da de Winton\r\njuxta Stenden bridge, which in that lane was over Walbrooke water.\r\n\r\nThen is the fair parish church of St. Michael called Paternoster church\r\nin the Royall. This church was new built, and made a college of St.\r\nSpirit and St. Mary, founded by Richard Whitington, mercer, four times\r\nmayor, for a master, four fellows--masters of art, clerks, conducts,\r\nchorists, etc., and an alms house called God’s house, or hospital, for\r\nthirteen poor men, one of them to be tutor, and to have sixteen pence\r\nthe week; the other twelve, each of them to have fourteen pence the\r\nweek for ever, with other necessary provisions, a hutch with three\r\nlocks, a common seal, etc. These were bound to pray for the good estate\r\nof Richard Whitington and Alice his wife, their founders, and for\r\nSir William Whitington, knight, and Dame Joan his wife, and for Hugh\r\nFitzwaren, and Dame Molde his wife, the fathers and mothers of the\r\nsaid Richard Whitington and Alice his wife, for King Richard II., and\r\nThomas of Woodstocke, Duke of Glocester, special lords and promoters of\r\nthe said Richard Whitington, etc. The license for this foundation was\r\ngranted by King Henry IV., the 11th of his reign, and in the 12th of the\r\nsame king’s reign, the mayor and commonalty of London granted to Richard\r\nWhitington a vacant piece of ground, thereon to build his college in\r\nthe Royall, all which was confirmed by Henry VI., the 3rd of his reign,\r\nto John Coventrie, Jenkin Carpenter, and William Grove, executors to\r\nRichard Whitington. This foundation was again confirmed by parliament,\r\nthe 10th of Henry VI., and was suppressed by the statute of Edward VI.\r\n\r\nThe alms houses, with the poor men, do remain, and are paid by the\r\nMercers. This Richard Whitington was in this church three times buried:\r\nfirst by his executors under a fair monument; then in the reign of\r\nEdward VI., the parson of that church, thinking some great riches (as\r\nhe said) to be buried with him, caused his monument to be broken, his\r\nbody to be spoiled of his leaden sheet, and again the second time to\r\nbe buried; and in the reign of Queen Mary the parishioners were forced\r\nto take him up, to lap him in lead as afore, to bury him the third\r\ntime, and to place his monument, or the like, over him again, which\r\nremaineth, and so he resteth. Thomas Windford, alderman, was buried in\r\nthis church 1448; Arnold Macknam, vintner, a merchant of Burdeaux, 1457;\r\nSir Heere Tanke, or Hartancleux, knight of the garter, born in Almayne,\r\na noble warrior in Henry V. and Henry VI. days; Sir Edmond Mulshew,\r\nknight, near to Thomas Cokham, recorder of London; the Lady Kyme; Sir\r\nWilliam Oldhall, knight, 1460; William Barnocke; Sir John Yong, grocer,\r\nmayor 1466; Agnes, daughter to Sir John Yong, first married to Robert\r\nSherington, after to Robert Mulleneux, then to William Cheyney, esquire;\r\nJohn Having, gentleman; William Roswell, esquire; William Postar, clerk\r\nof the crown, 1520; Sir William Bayly, draper, mayor 1533, with Dame\r\nKatherine his wife, leaving sixteen children; John Haydon, mercer,\r\nsheriff 1582, who gave legacies to the thirteen alms men, and otherwise,\r\nfor a lecture.\r\n\r\nAt the upper end of this street is the Tower Royall, whereof that street\r\ntaketh name. This Tower and great place was so called of pertaining to\r\nthe kings of this realm, but by whom the same was first built, or of\r\nwhat antiquity continued, I have not read more than that in the reign\r\nof Edward I., the 2nd, 4th, and 7th years, it was the tenement of Symon\r\nBeawmes; also, that in the 36th of Edward III., the same was called the\r\nRoyall, in the parish of St. Michael de Paternoster, and that in the\r\n43rd of his reign, he gave it by the name of his inn, called the Royall,\r\nin the city of London, in value twenty pounds by year, unto his college\r\nof St. Stephen at Westminster; notwithstanding, in the reign of Richard\r\nII. it was called the Queen’s Wardrobe, as appeareth by this that\r\nfolloweth:--King Richard having in Smithfield overcome and dispersed his\r\nrebels, he, his lords, and all his company, entered the city of London,\r\nwith great joy, and went to the lady princess his mother, who was then\r\nlodged in the Tower Royall, called the Queen’s Wardrobe, where she had\r\nremained three days and two nights, right sore abashed; but when she\r\nsaw the king her son she was greatly rejoiced, and said, “Ah, son! what\r\ngreat sorrow have I suffered for you this day!” The king answered and\r\nsaid, “Certainly, madam, I know it well; but now rejoice, and thank\r\nGod, for I have this day recovered mine heritage, and the realm of\r\nEngland, which I had near hand lost.”\r\n\r\nThis tower seemeth to have been at that time of good defence; for when\r\nthe rebels had beset the Tower of London, and got possession thereof,\r\ntaking from thence whom they listed, as in my _Annals_ I have shown, the\r\nprincess being forced to fly, came to this Tower Royal, where she was\r\nlodged, and remained safe, as ye have heard; and it may be also supposed\r\nthat the king himself was at that time lodged there. I read, that in the\r\nyear 1386, Lyon King of Armonie, being chased out of his realm by the\r\nTartarians, received innumerable gifts of the king and of his nobles,\r\nthe king then lying in the Royall, where he also granted to the said\r\nking of Armonie, a charter of a thousand pounds by year during his\r\nlife. This for proof may suffice that kings of England have been lodged\r\nin this tower, though the same of later time have been neglected, and\r\nturned into stabling for the king’s horses, and now letten out to divers\r\nmen, and divided into tenements.\r\n\r\nIn Horsebridge street is the Cutlars’ hall. Richard de Wilehale, 1295,\r\nconfirmed to Paul Butelar this house and edifices in the parish of St.\r\nMichael Paternoster church and St. John’s upon Walbrooke, which sometime\r\nLawrens Gisors and his son Peter Gisors did possess, and afterward\r\nHugonis de Hingham, and lieth between the tenement of the said Richard\r\ntowards the south, and the lane called Horseshew bridge towards the\r\nnorth, and between the way called Paternoster church on the west,\r\nand the course of Walbrooke on the east, paying yearly one clove of\r\nGereflowers at Easter, and to the prior and convent of St. Mary Overy\r\nsix shillings. This house sometime belonged to Simon Dolesly, grocer,\r\nmayor 1359. They of this company were of old time divided into three\r\narts or sorts of workmen: to wit, the first were smiths, forgers of\r\nblades, and therefore called bladers, and divers of them proved wealthy\r\nmen, as namely, Walter Nele, blader, one of the sheriffs the 12th of\r\nEdward III., deceased 1352, and buried in St. James’ Garlicke Hith; he\r\nleft lands to the mending of high ways about London, betwixt Newgate\r\nand Wicombe, Aldgate and Chelmesford, Bishopsgate and Ware, Southwark\r\nand Rochester, etc. The second were makers of hafts, and otherwise\r\ngarnishers of blades. The third sort were sheathmakers, for swords,\r\ndaggers, and knives. In the 10th of Henry IV. certain ordinances were\r\nmade betwixt the bladers and the other cutlers; and in the 4th of\r\nHenry VI. they were all three companies drawn into one fraternity or\r\nbrotherhood by the name of Cutlers.\r\n\r\nThen is Knightriders’ street, so called (as is supposed) of knights well\r\narmed and mounted at the Tower Royall, riding from thence through that\r\nstreet west to Creed lane, and so out at Ludgate towards Smithfield,\r\nwhen they were there to tourney, joust, or otherwise to show activities\r\nbefore the king and states of the realm.\r\n\r\nIn this street is the parish church of St. Thomas Apostle, by Wringwren\r\nlane, a proper church, but monuments of antiquity be there none, except\r\nsome arms in the windows, as also in the stone work, which some suppose\r\nto be of John Barns, mercer, mayor of London in the year 1371, a great\r\nbuilder thereof; H. Causton, merchant, was a benefactor, and had a\r\nchantry there about 1396; T. Roman, mayor 1310, had also a chantry there\r\n1319; Fitzwilliams, also a benefactor, had a chantry there. More, Sir\r\nWilliam Littlesbery, _alias_ Horne (for King Edward IV. so named him,\r\nbecause he was a most excellent blower in a horn); he was a Salter\r\nand merchant of the staple, mayor of London in the year 1487, and was\r\nburied in this church, having appointed by his testament the bells to\r\nbe changed for four new bells of good tune and sound, but that was not\r\nperformed; he gave five hundred marks to the repairing of highways\r\nbetwixt London and Cambridge; his dwelling-house, with a garden and\r\nappurtenances in the said parish to be sold, and bestowed in charitable\r\nactions, as his executors would answer before God; his house, called the\r\nGeorge, in Bred street, he gave to the Salters, they to find a priest in\r\nthe said church, to have £6 13_s._ 4_d._ the year, to every preacher at\r\nPaul’s cross and at the Spittle four pence for ever; to the prisoners\r\nof Newgate, Ludgate, Marshalsey, and King’s Bench, in victuals, ten\r\nshillings at Christmas, and ten shillings at Easter for ever; which\r\nlegacies are not performed. William Shipton, William Champneis, and\r\nJohn de Burford, had chantries there; John Martin, butcher, one of the\r\nsheriffs, was buried there 1533; etc. Then west from the said church,\r\non the same side, was one great messuage, sometime called Ipres inn, of\r\nWilliam Ipres, a Fleming, the first builder thereof. This William was\r\ncalled out of Flanders, with a number of Flemings, to the aid of King\r\nStephen against Maude the empress, in the year 1138, and grew in favour\r\nwith the said king for his services, so far that he built this his house\r\nnear Tower Royall, in the which tower it seemeth the king was then\r\nlodged, as in the heart of the city, for his more safety.\r\n\r\nRobert, Earl of Gloucester, brother to the empress, being taken, was\r\ncommitted to the custody of this William, to be kept in the castle\r\nof Rochester, till King Stephen was also taken, and then the one was\r\ndelivered in exchange for the other, and both set free. This William of\r\nIpres gave Edredes hithe, now called the Queen’s hithe, to the prior and\r\ncanons of the Holy Trinity in London: he founded the abbey of Boxley\r\nin Kent, etc. In the first of Henry II., the said William, with all\r\nthe other Flemings, fearing the indignation of the new king, departed\r\nthe land; but it seemeth that the said William was shortly called back\r\nagain, and restored both to the king’s favour and to his old possessions\r\nhere, so that the name and family continued long after in this realm, as\r\nmay appear by this which followeth.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1377, the 51st of Edward III., the citizens of London,\r\nminding to have destroyed John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, and Henry\r\nPercie, marshal (for cause shown in my _Annals_), sought up and down,\r\nand could not find them, for they were that day to dine with John of\r\nIpres at his inn, which the Londoners wist not of, but thought the duke\r\nand marshal had been at the Savoy, and therefore posted thither; but one\r\nof the duke’s knights seeing these things, came in great haste to the\r\nplace where the duke was, and after that he had knocked and could not be\r\nlet in, he said to Haveland the porter, “If thou love my lord and thy\r\nlife, open the gate;” with which words he gat entry, and with great fear\r\nhe tells the duke, that without the gate were infinite numbers of armed\r\nmen, and unless he took great heed that day would be his last; with\r\nwhich words the duke leapt so hastily from his oisters, that he hurt\r\nboth his legs against the form: wine was offered, but he could not drink\r\nfor haste, and so fled with his fellow Henry Percie out at a back gate,\r\nand entering the Thames, never stayed rowing until they came to a house\r\nnear the manor of Kennington, where at that time the princess lay with\r\nRichard the young prince, before whom he made his complaint, etc.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, I read of a messuage called Ringed hall. King Henry\r\nVIII., the 32nd of his reign, gave the same, with four tenements\r\nadjoining, unto Morgan Philip, _alias_ Wolfe, in the parish of St.\r\nThomas Apostles, in London, etc.\r\n\r\nOver against Ipres inn, in Knight riders street, at the corner towards\r\nSt. James at Garlicke hithe, was sometime a great house built of stone\r\nand called Ormond place, for that it sometimes belonged to the Earls of\r\nOrmond. King Edward IV., in the 5th of his reign, gave to Elizabeth his\r\nwife the manor of Greenwich, with the tower and park, in the county\r\nof Kent. He also gave this tenement called Ormond place, with all the\r\nappurtenances to the same, situate in the parish of St. Trinitie in\r\nKnight riders street, in London. This house is now lately taken down,\r\nand divers fair tenements are built there, the corner house whereof\r\nis a tavern. Then lower down in Royall street is Kerion lane, of one\r\nKerion sometime dwelling there. In this lane be divers fair houses for\r\nmerchants, and amongst others is the Glaziers’ hall.\r\n\r\nAt the south corner of Royall street is the fair parish church of St.\r\nMartin called in the Vintry, sometime called St. Martin de Beremand\r\nchurch. This church was new built about the year 1399 by the executors\r\nof Mathew Columbars a stranger born, a Burdeaux merchant of Gascoyne and\r\nFrench wines; his arms remain yet in the east window, and are between\r\na cheveron, three columbins. There lie buried in this church--Sir John\r\nGisors, mayor 1311; Henry Gisors, his son, 1343, and John Gisors, his\r\nbrother, 1350; he gave to his son Thomas his great mansion-house called\r\nGisors hall, in the parish of St. Mildred, in Bread street. This Thomas\r\nhad issue, John and Thomas; John made a feoffment, and sold Gisors hall\r\nand other his lands in London, about the year 1386; Thomas deceased\r\n1395. Henry Vennar; Bartholomew de la Vauch; Thomas Cornwalles, one\r\nof the sheriffs 1384; John Cornwalles, esquire, 1436; John Mustrell,\r\nvintner, 1424; William Hodson; William Castleton; John Gray; Robert\r\nDalusse, barber, in the reign of Edward IV., with this epitaph:\r\n\r\n    “As flowers in the field thus passeth life,\r\n    Naked, then clothed, feeble in the end,\r\n    It sheweth by Robert Dalusse, and Alison his wife,\r\n    Christ them save from the power of the fiend.”\r\n\r\nSir Raph Austrie, fishmonger, new roofed this church with timber,\r\ncovered it with lead, and beautifully glazed it: he deceased 1494, and\r\nwas there buried with his two wives; Raph Austrie, his son, gentleman;\r\nWilliam Austrie, and other of that name; Bartrand, wife to Grimond\r\nDescure, esquire, a Gascoyne and merchant of wines, 1494; Thomas Batson;\r\nAlice Fowler, daughter and heir to John Howton, wife to John Hulton;\r\nJames Bartlet, and Alice his wife; William Fennor; Roger Cotton;\r\nRobert Stocker; John Pemberton; Philip de Plasse; John Stapleton; John\r\nMortimer; William Lee; William Hamsteed; William Stoksbie, and Gilbert\r\nMarch, had chantries there.\r\n\r\nThen is the parish church of St. James, called at Garlick hithe, or\r\nGarlicke hive; for that of old time, on the bank of the river of Thames,\r\nnear to this church, garlick was usually sold. This is a proper church,\r\nwhereof Richard Rothing, one of the sheriffs 1326, is said to be the new\r\nbuilder, and lieth buried in the same: so was Waltar Nele, blader, one\r\nof the sheriffs 1337; John of Oxenford, vintner, mayor 1341. I read, in\r\nthe 1st of Edward III., that this John of Oxenford gave to the priory\r\nof the Holy Trinity in London two tofts of land, one mill, fifty acres\r\nof land, two acres of wood, with the appurtenances, in Kentish town, in\r\nvalue 20_s._ 3_d._ by year. Richard Goodcheape, John de Cressingham,\r\nand John Whitthorne, and before them, Galfrid Moncley, 1281, founded a\r\nchantry there.\r\n\r\nMonuments remaining there: Robert Gabeter, esquire, mayor of\r\nNewcastle-upon-Tyne, 1310; John Gisors; William Tiligham; John Stanley;\r\nLord Strange, eldest son of the Earl of Derby, 1503; Nicholas Statham;\r\nRobert de Luton, 1361; Richard Lions, a famous merchant of wines, and\r\na lapidary, sometime one of the sheriffs, beheaded in Cheape by Wat\r\nTyler and other rebels in the year 1381; his picture on his gravestone,\r\nvery fair and large, is with his hair rounded by his ears, and curled;\r\na little beard forked; a gown, girt to him down to his feet, of\r\nbranched damask, wrought with the likeness of flowers; a large purse\r\non his right side, hanging in a belt from his left shoulder; a plain\r\nhood about his neck covering his shoulders, and hanging back behind\r\nhim. Sir John Wrotch, fishmonger, mayor 1361, deceased 1407; Thomas\r\nStonarde, of Oxfordshire; John Bromer, fishmonger, alderman 1474; the\r\nLady Stanley, mother to the Lord Strange; the Countess of Huntingdon;\r\nthe Lady Harbert; Sir George Stanley; Gilbert Bovet, 1398; a Countess\r\nof Worcester, and one of her children; William More, vintner, mayor\r\n1395; William Venor, grocer, mayor 1389; Robert Chichley, mayor 1421;\r\nJames Spencer, vintner, mayor 1543; Richard Plat, brewer, founded a free\r\nschool there 1601.\r\n\r\nAnd thus an end of Vintry ward, which hath an alderman, with a deputy,\r\ncommon councillors nine, constables nine, scavengers four, wardmote\r\ninquest fourteen, and a beadle. It is taxed to the fifteen[189] at £6\r\n13_s._ 4_d._\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[187] “In London at thirty-six pound, and in the Exchequer at\r\nthirty-four pound ten shillings.”--_1st edition_, p. 189.\r\n\r\n[188] “Having thus much, not without travail and some charges, noted for\r\nthe antiquitie of the Vintners, about two years since or more I repayred\r\nto the common-hall of that company, and there showed and read it in\r\na court of assistance, requiring them, as being one of the principal\r\ncompanies in the citie (of whom I meant therefore to write the more at\r\nlarge) that if they knew any more which might sound to their worship or\r\ncommendation, at their leisure to send it me, and I would joyne it to\r\nmy former collection; at which time I was answered by some that tooke\r\nupon them the speech, that they were none of the principall, but of\r\nthe inferior companies; and so willing me to leave them, I departed,\r\nand never since heard from them, which hath somewhat discouraged me\r\nany farther to travail amongst the companies to learne ought at their\r\nhandes.”--_1st edition_, p. 192.\r\n\r\nHis comment (in a side note) is equally worth preserving: “The readiest\r\nto speake not alwaies the wisest men.”\r\n\r\n[189] “In London at six and thirty pounds, and in the Exchequer at\r\nthirty-five pounds five shillings.”--_1st edition_, p. 195.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORDWAINER STREET WARD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next is Cordwainer street ward, taking that name of cordwainers, or\r\nshoemakers, curriers, and workers of leather, dwelling there; for it\r\nappeareth in the records of Henry VI., the 9th of his reign, that an\r\norder was taken then for cordwainers and curriers in Corney street and\r\nSopars lane.\r\n\r\nThis ward beginneth in the east, on the west side of Walbrook, and\r\nturneth west through Budge row (a street so called of the Budge furre,\r\nand of skinners dwelling there), then up by St. Anthony’s church through\r\nAetheling (or Noble street), as Leland termeth it, commonly called\r\nWathling street, to the Red Lion, a place so called of a great lion\r\nof timber placed there at a gate, entering a large court, wherein are\r\ndivers fair and large shops, well furnished with broad cloths and other\r\ndraperies of all sorts, to be sold: and this is the farthest west part\r\nof this ward.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of this street from Budge row lieth a lane turning\r\ndown by the west gate of the Tower Royal, and to the south end of the\r\nstone wall beyond the said gate is of this ward, and is accounted a part\r\nof the Royal street: against this west gate of the Tower Royal is one\r\nother lane that runneth west to Cordwainer street, and this is called\r\nTurnebase lane; on the south side whereof is a piece of Wringwren lane,\r\nto the north-west corner of St. Thomas Church the Apostle. Then again,\r\nout of the high street called Wathling, is one other street, which\r\nrunneth thwart the same; and this is Cordwainer street, whereof the\r\nwhole ward taketh name. This street beginneth by West Cheape, and St.\r\nMary Bow church is the head thereof on the west side, and it runneth\r\ndown south through that part which of later time was called Hosier\r\nlane, now Bow lane, and then by the west end of Aldmary church to the\r\nnew built houses, in place of Ormond house, and so to Garlicke hill,\r\nor hithe, to St. James’ church. The upper part of this street towards\r\nCheape was called Hosier lane, of hosiers dwelling there in place of\r\nshoemakers; but now those hosiers being worn out by men of other trades\r\n(as the hosiers had worn out the shoemakers), the same is called Bow\r\nlane of Bow church. On the west side of Cordewainers street is Basing\r\nlane, right over against Turnebasse lane. This Basing lane west to the\r\nback gate of the Red Lion, in Wathling street, is of this Cordwainers\r\nstreet ward.\r\n\r\nNow again, on the north side of the high street in Budge row, by the\r\neast end of St. Anthonie’s church, have ye St. Sithes lane, so called of\r\nSt. Sithes church (which standeth against the north end of that lane),\r\nand this is wholly of Cordwainers street ward: also the south side of\r\nNeedlers lane, which reacheth from the north end of St. Sithes lane west\r\nto Sopar’s lane; then west from St. Anthonies church is the south end\r\nof Sopar’s lane, which lane took that name, not of soap-making, as some\r\nhave supposed, but of Alen le Sopar, in the 9th of Edward II. I have not\r\nread or heard of soap-making in this city till within this fourscore\r\nyears; that John Lame, dwelling in Grasse street, set up a boiling-house\r\nfor this city, of former time, was served of white soap in hard cakes\r\n(called Castell soap, and other), from beyond the seas, and of grey\r\nsoap,[190] speckled with white, very sweet and good, from Bristow, sold\r\nhere for a penny the pound, and never above a penny farthing, and black\r\nsoap for a halfpenny the pound. Then in Bow lane (as they now call it)\r\nis Goose lane, by Bow church. William Essex, mercer, had tenements there\r\nin the 26th of Edward III.\r\n\r\nThen from the south end of Bow lane, by Wathling street, till over\r\nagainst the Red Lion: and these be the bounds of Cordwainer street ward.\r\n\r\nTouching monuments therein, first you have the fair parish church of\r\nSt. Anthonies in Budge row, on the north side thereof. This church\r\nwas lately re-edified by Thomas Knowles, grocer, mayor, and by Thomas\r\nKnowles, his son, both buried there, with epitaphs, of the father thus:\r\n\r\n    “Here lieth graven vnder this stone,\r\n    Thomas Knowles, both flesh and bone;\r\n    Grocer and alderman, yeares fortie,\r\n    Shiriffe, and twice maior truly.\r\n    And for he should not lie alone,\r\n    Here lieth with him his good wife Joan.\r\n    They were togither sixtie yeare,\r\n    And ninteene children they had in feere,” etc.\r\n\r\nThomas Holland, mercer, was there buried 1456; Thomas Windent, mercer,\r\nalderman, and Katherine his wife; Thomas Hind, mercer, 1528; he was a\r\nbenefactor to this church, to Aldermarie church, and to Bow; Hugh Acton,\r\nmerchant-tailor, buried 1520; he gave thirty-six pounds to the repairing\r\nof the steeple of this church. Simon Street, grocer, lieth in the\r\nchurch wall toward the south; his arms be three colts, and his epitaph\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n    “Such as I am, such shall you be,\r\n    Grocer of London sometime was I,\r\n    The king’s wayer more then yeares twentie,\r\n    Simon Streete called in my place,\r\n    And good fellowship faine would trace;\r\n    Therefore in heaven, everlasting life,\r\n    Jesu send me, and Agnes my wife:\r\n    Kerlie Merlie, my words were tho,\r\n    And _Deo gratias_ I coupled thereto:\r\n    I passed to God in the yeare of grace,\r\n    A thousand foure hundred it was,” etc.\r\n\r\nWilliam Dauntsey, mercer, one of the sheriffs, buried 1542. Henry\r\nCollet, mercer, mayor, a great benefactor to this church; the pictures\r\nof him, his wife, ten sons, and ten daughters, remain in the glass\r\nwindow on the north side of the church; but the said Henry Collet\r\nwas buried at Stebunhith. Henry Halton, grocer, one of the sheriffs,\r\ndeceased 1415; Thomas Spight, merchant-tailor, 1533; and Roger Martin,\r\nmercer, mayor, deceased 1573. John Grantham and Nicholas Bull had\r\nchantries there.\r\n\r\nNext on the south side of Budge row, by the west corner thereof, and\r\non the east side of Cordwainer street, is one other fair church called\r\nAldemarie church, because the same was very old, and elder than any\r\nchurch of St. Marie in the city, till of late years the foundation of a\r\nvery fair new church was laid there by Henry Keble, grocer, mayor, who\r\ndeceased 1518, and was there buried in a vault by him prepared, with a\r\nfair monument raised over him on the north side the choir, now destroyed\r\nand gone: he gave by his testament one thousand pounds towards the\r\nbuilding up of that church, and yet not permitted a resting-place for\r\nhis bones there. Thomas Roman, mayor 1310, had a chantry there. Richard\r\nChawcer,[191] vintner, gave to that church his tenement and tavern,\r\nwith the appurtenance, in the Royal street, the corner of Kerion lane,\r\nand was there buried 1348. John Briton; Ralph Holland, draper, one of\r\nthe sheriffs, deceased 1452; William Taylor, grocer, mayor, deceased\r\n1483: he discharged that ward of fifteens to be paid by the poor. Thomas\r\nHinde, mercer, buried in St. Anthonies, gave ten fodder of lead to the\r\ncovering of the middle aisle of this Aldemarie church. Charles Blunt,\r\nLord Montjoy, was buried there about the year 1545; he made or glazed\r\nthe east window, as appeareth by his arms: his epitaph, made by him in\r\nhis lifetime, thus:\r\n\r\n    “Willingly have I fought, and willingly have I found\r\n    The fatall end that wrought thither as dutie bound:\r\n    Discharged I am of that I ought to my country by honest wound,\r\n    My soule departed Christ hath bought, the end of man is ground.”\r\n\r\nSir William Laxton, grocer, mayor, deceased 1556, and Thomas Lodge,\r\ngrocer, mayor 1583, were buried in the vault of Henry Keble, whose bones\r\nwere unkindly cast out, and his monument pulled down;[192] in place\r\nwhereof monuments are set up of the later buried. William Blunt, Lord\r\nMountjoy, buried there 1594, etc.\r\n\r\nAt the upper end of Hosier lane, toward Westcheape, is the fair parish\r\nchurch of St. Mary Bow. This church, in the reign of William Conqueror,\r\nbeing the first in this city built on arches of stone, was therefore\r\ncalled New Marie church, of St. Marie de Arcubus,[193] or Le Bow, in\r\nWest Cheaping; as Stratford bridge being the first built (by Matilde the\r\nqueen, wife to Henry I.) with arches of stone, was called Stratford le\r\nBow; which names to the said church and bridge remaineth till this day.\r\nThe court of the Arches is kept in this church, and taketh name of the\r\nplace, not the place of the court; but of what antiquity or continuation\r\nthat court hath there continued I cannot learn.\r\n\r\nThis church is of Cordwainer street ward, and for divers accidents\r\nhappening there, hath been made more famous than any other parish church\r\nof the whole city or suburbs. First, we read, that in the year 1090, and\r\nthe 3rd of William Rufus, by tempest of wind, the roof of the church of\r\nSt. Marie Bow, in Cheape, was overturned, wherewith some persons were\r\nslain, and four of the rafters, of twenty-six feet in length, with such\r\nviolence were pitched in the ground of the high street, that scantly\r\nfour feet of them remained above ground, which were fain to be cut even\r\nwith the ground, because they could not be plucked out (for the city of\r\nLondon was not then paved, and a marish ground).\r\n\r\nIn the year 1196, William Fitz Osbert, a seditious tailor, took the\r\nsteeple of Bow, and fortified it with munitions and victuals, but it\r\nwas assaulted, and William with his accomplices were taken, though not\r\nwithout bloodshed, for he was forced by fire and smoke to forsake the\r\nchurch; and then, by the judges condemned, he was by the heels drawn\r\nto the Elms in Smithfield, and there hanged with nine of his fellows;\r\nwhere, because his favourers came not to deliver him, he forsook Mary’s\r\nson (as he termed Christ our Saviour), and called upon the devil to help\r\nand deliver him. Such was the end of this deceiver, a man of an evil\r\nlife, a secret murderer, a filthy fornicator, a pollutor of concubines,\r\nand (amongst other his detestable facts) a false accuser of his elder\r\nbrother,[194] who had in his youth brought him up in learning, and done\r\nmany things for his preferment.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1271, a great part of the steeple of Bow fell down, and\r\nslew many people, men and women. In the year 1284, the 13th of Edward\r\nI., Laurence Ducket, goldsmith, having grievously wounded one Ralph\r\nCrepin in Westcheape, fled into Bow church; into the which in the night\r\ntime entered certain evil persons, friends unto the said Ralph, and\r\nslew the said Laurence lying in the steeple, and then hanged him up,\r\nplacing him so by the window as if he had hanged himself, and so was it\r\nfound by inquisition; for the which fact Laurence Ducket, being drawn\r\nby the feet, was buried in a ditch without the city; but shortly after,\r\nby relation of a boy, who lay with the said Laurence at the time of\r\nhis death, and had hid him there for fear, the truth of the matter was\r\ndisclosed; for the which cause, Jordan Goodcheape, Ralph Crepin, Gilbert\r\nClarke, and Geffrey Clarke, were attainted; a certain woman named Alice,\r\nthat was chief causer of the said mischief, was burnt, and to the number\r\nof sixteen men were drawn and hanged, besides others that being richer,\r\nafter long imprisonment, were hanged by the purse.\r\n\r\nThe church was interdicted, the doors and windows were stopped up with\r\nthorns, but Laurence was taken up, and honestly buried in the churchyard.\r\n\r\nThe parish church of St. Mary Bow, by mean of incroachment and building\r\nof houses, wanting room in their churchyard for burial of the dead, John\r\nRotham, or Rodham, citizen and tailor, by his testament, dated the year\r\n1465, gave to the parson and churchwardens a certain garden in Hosier\r\nlane to be a churchyard, which so continued near a hundred years; but\r\nnow is built on, and is a private man’s house. The old steeple of this\r\nchurch was by little and little re-edified, and new built up, at the\r\nleast so much as was fallen down, many men giving sums of money to the\r\nfurtherance thereof; so that at length, to wit, in the year 1469, it\r\nwas ordained by a common council that the Bow bell should be nightly\r\nrung at nine of the clock. Shortly after, John Donne, mercer, by his\r\ntestament, dated 1472, according to the trust of Reginald Longdon, gave\r\nto the parson and churchwardens of St. Mary Bow two tenements, with the\r\nappurtenances, since made into one, in Hosier lane, then so called, to\r\nthe maintenance of Bow bell, the same to be rung as aforesaid, and other\r\nthings to be observed, as by the will appeareth.\r\n\r\nThis bell being usually rung somewhat late, as seemed to the young men\r\n’prentices, and other in Cheape, they made and set up a rhyme against\r\nthe clerk, as followeth:\r\n\r\n    “Clarke of the Bow bell with the yellow lockes,\r\n    For thy late ringing thy head shall have knocks.”\r\n\r\nWhereunto the clerk replying, wrote,\r\n\r\n    “Children of Cheape, hold you all still,\r\n    For you shall have the Bow bell rung at your will.”\r\n\r\nRobert Harding, goldsmith, one of the sheriffs 1478, gave to the new\r\nwork of that steeple forty pounds; John Haw, mercer, ten pounds; Doctor\r\nAllen, four pounds; Thomas Baldry, four pounds, and other gave other\r\nsums, so that the said work of the steeple was finished in the year\r\n1512. The arches or bowes thereupon, with the lanthorns, five in number,\r\nto wit, one at each corner, and one on the top in the middle upon\r\nthe arches, were also afterward finished of stone, brought from Caen\r\nin Normandy, delivered at the Customers key for 4_s._ 8_d._ the ton;\r\nWilliam Copland, tailor, the king’s merchant, and Andrew Fuller, mercer,\r\nbeing churchwardens 1515 and 1516. It is said that this Copland gave the\r\ngreat bell, which made the fifth in the ring, to be rung nightly at nine\r\nof the clock. This bell was first rung as a knell at the burial of the\r\nsame Copland. It appeareth that the lanthorns on the top of this steeple\r\nwere meant to have been glazed, and lights in them placed nightly in\r\nthe winter, whereby travellers to the city might have the better sight\r\nthereof, and not to miss of their ways.\r\n\r\nIn this parish also was a grammar school, by commandment of King Henry\r\nVI., which school was of old time kept in a house for that purpose\r\nprepared in the churchyard; but that school being decayed, as others\r\nabout this city, the school-house was let out for rent, in the reign of\r\nHenry VIII., for four shillings the year, a cellar for two shillings the\r\nyear, and two vaults under the church for fifteen shillings both.\r\n\r\nThe monuments in this church be these; namely, of Sir John Coventrie,\r\nmercer, mayor 1425; Richard Lambert, alderman; Nicholas Alwine, mercer,\r\nmayor 1499; Robert Harding, goldsmith, one of the sheriffs 1478; John\r\nLoke, one of the sheriffs 1461; Edward Bankes, alderman, haberdasher,\r\n1566; John Warde; William Pierson, scrivener and attorney in the Common\r\nPleas. In a proper chapel on the south side the church standeth a tomb,\r\nelevated and arched.[195] Ade de Buke, hatter, glazed the chapel and\r\nmost part of the church, and was there buried. All other monuments be\r\ndefaced. Hawley and Southam had chantries there.\r\n\r\nWithout the north side of this church of St. Mary Bow, towards West\r\nCheape, standeth one fair building of stone, called in record Seldam,\r\na shed, which greatly darkeneth the said church; for by means thereof\r\nall the windows and doors on that side are stopped up. King Edward III.\r\nupon occasion, as shall be shown in the ward of Cheape, caused this sild\r\nor shed to be made, and to be strongly built of stone, for himself, the\r\nqueen, and other estates to stand in, there to behold the joustings and\r\nother shows at their pleasures. And this house for a long time after\r\nserved to that use, namely, in the reign of Edward III. and Richard II.;\r\nbut in the year 1410, Henry IV., in the 12th of his reign, confirmed the\r\nsaid shed or building to Stephen Spilman, William Marchford, and John\r\nWhateley, mercers, by the name of one New Seldam, shed, or building,\r\nwith shops, cellars, and edifices whatsoever appertaining, called\r\nCrounsilde, or Tamersilde,[196] situate in the mercery in West Cheape,\r\nand in the parish of St. Mary de Arcubus in London, etc. Notwithstanding\r\nwhich grant, the kings of England, and other great estates, as well\r\nof foreign countries, repairing to this realm, as inhabitants of the\r\nsame, have usually repaired to this place, therein to behold the shows\r\nof this city passing through West Cheape, namely, the great watches\r\naccustomed in the night, on the even of St. John Baptist, and St. Peter\r\nat Midsummer, the examples whereof were over long to recite, wherefore\r\nlet it suffice briefly to touch one. In the year 1510, on St. John’s\r\neven, at night, King Henry VIII. came to this place, then called the\r\nKing’s Head in Cheape, in the livery of a yeoman of the guard, with an\r\nhalbert on his shoulder (and there beholding the watch) departed privily\r\nwhen the watch was done, and was not known to any but to whom it pleased\r\nhim; but on St. Peter’s night next following, he and the queen came\r\nroyally riding to the said place, and there with their nobles beheld the\r\nwatch of the city, and returned in the morning.\r\n\r\nThis church of St. Mary, with the said shed of stone, all the housing\r\nin or about Bow church yard, and without on that side the high street\r\nof Cheape to the Standard, be of Cordewainer street ward. These houses\r\nwere of old time but sheds; for I read of no housing otherwise on that\r\nside the street, but of divers sheds from Sopar’s lane to the Standard,\r\netc. Amongst other, I read of three shops or sheds by Sopar’s lane,\r\npertaining to the priory of the Holy Trinity within Aldgate; the one\r\nwas let out for twenty-eight shillings, one other for twenty shillings,\r\nand the third for twelve shillings, by the year. Moreover, that Richard\r\nGoodchepe, mercer, and Margery his wife, son to Jordaine Goodchepe, did\r\nlet to John Dalinges the younger, mercer, their shed and chamber in West\r\nCheape, in the parish of St. Mary de Arches for three shillings and four\r\npence by the year. Also the men of Bread street ward contended with\r\nthe men of Cordwayner street ward for a seld or shed opposite to the\r\nStandard, on the south side, and it was found to be of Cordwayner street\r\nward; W. Waldorne being then mayor, the 1st of Henry VI. Thus much for\r\nCordwainer street ward; which hath an alderman, his deputy, common\r\ncouncillors eight, constables eight, scavengers eight, wardmote inquest\r\nmen fourteen, and a beadle. It standeth taxed to the fifteen in London\r\nat £52 16_s._, in the Exchequer at £52 6_s._[197]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[190] “Gray sope made in London dearer than bought from\r\nBristol.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\n[191] “Richard Chaucer, father to Geffrey Chaucer, the poet, as may be\r\nsupposed.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\n[192] “Sir William Laxton, grocer, mayor, deceased 1556, was buried in\r\nthe vault prepared by Henry Keble, principall founder of that church,\r\nfor himself, but now his bones are unkindly cast out, his monuments\r\npulled downe, and the bodies of the said Sir William Laxton, and of Sir\r\nThomas Lodge, grocer, mayor, are laid in place, with monuments over them\r\nfor the time, till an other give money for their place, and then away\r\nwith them.”--_1st edition_, p. 199.\r\n\r\n[193] “Called _de Arcubus_ of the stone arches or bowes on the top of\r\nthe steeple or bell tower thereof, which arching was as well on the old\r\nsteeple as on the new, for no other part of the church seemeth to have\r\nbeen arched at any time; yet hath the said church never been knowne by\r\nany other name than St. Mary Bow, or le Bow; neither is that church so\r\ncalled of the court there kept, but the said court taketh name of the\r\nplace wherein it is kept, and is called the Court of Arches.”--_1st\r\nedition_, p. 203.\r\n\r\n[194] “A false accuser of his elder brother, in the end was\r\nhanged.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\nIn his first edition, p. 203, this note is continued as follows: “God\r\namend, or shortly send such an end to such false brethren.”\r\n\r\n[195] “Of some unknowne founder.”--_1st edition_, p. 205.\r\n\r\n[196] “And in the 8th of the same Henry called Tamarsilde.”--_1st\r\nedition_, p. 206.\r\n\r\n[197] “In London at £72 16_s._, in the Exchequer at £72.”--_1st\r\nedition_, p. 207.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEAPE WARD\r\n\r\n\r\nNext adjoining is Cheape ward, and taketh name of the market there kept,\r\ncalled West Cheping. This ward also beginneth in the east, on the course\r\nof Walbrooke in Buckles bury, and runneth up on both the sides to the\r\ngreat conduit in Cheape. Also on the south side of Buckles bury, a lane\r\nturning up by St. Sithes church, and by St. Pancrates church, through\r\nNeedler’s lane, on the north side thereof, and then through a piece of\r\nSopar’s lane, on both sides up to Cheape, be all of Cheape ward.\r\n\r\nThen to begin again in the east upon the said course of Walbrooke,\r\nis St. Mildred’s church in the Poultrie, on the north side, and over\r\nagainst the said church gate, on the south, to pass up all that high\r\nstreet called the Poultrie, to the great conduit in Cheape, and then\r\nCheape itself, which beginneth by the east end of the said conduit, and\r\nstretcheth up to the north-east corner of Bow lane on the south side,\r\nand to the Standard on the north side; and thus far to the west is of\r\nCheape ward.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of this high street is no lane turning south out of\r\nthis ward, more than some portion of Sopar’s lane, whereof I have before\r\nwritten. But on the north side of this high street is Conyhope lane,\r\nabout one quarter of Old Jury lane on the west side, and on the east\r\nside almost as much, to the sign of the Angel. Then is Ironmonger’s\r\nlane, all wholly on both sides, and from the north end thereof through\r\nCatton street, west to the north end of St. Lawrence lane, and some four\r\nhouses west beyond the same on that side, and over against Ironmonger’s\r\nlane end on the north side of Catton street up by the Guildhall and St.\r\nLawrence church in the Jurie, is altogether of Cheape ward. Then again\r\nin Cheape, more towards the west, is of St. Lawrence lane before named,\r\nwhich is all wholly of this ward. And last of all is Hony lane, and up\r\nto the Standard on the north side of Cheape. And so stand the bounds of\r\nCheape ward.\r\n\r\nNow for antiquities there. First is Buckles bury, so called of a manor\r\nand tenements pertaining to one Buckle, who there dwelt and kept his\r\ncourts. This manor is supposed to be the great stone building, yet in\r\npart remaining on the south side of the street, which of late time hath\r\nbeen called the Old Barge, of such a sign hanged out near the gate\r\nthereof. This manor or great house hath of long time been divided and\r\nletten out into many tenements; and it hath been a common speech, that\r\nwhen Walbrooke did lie open, barges were rowed out of the Thames, or\r\ntowed up so far, and therefore the place hath ever since been called the\r\nOld Barge.\r\n\r\nAlso on the north side of this street, directly over against the said\r\nBuckles bury, was one ancient and strong tower of stone, the which\r\ntower King Edward III., in the 18th of his reign, by the name of the\r\nking’s house, called Cornette stoure in London, did appoint to be his\r\nExchange of money there to be kept. In the 29th he granted it to Frydus\r\nGuynysane and Landus Bardoile, merchants of Luke, for twenty pounds the\r\nyear. And in the 32nd he gave the same tower to his college or free\r\nchapel of St. Stephen at Westminster, by the name of Cernet’s Tower at\r\nBuckles bury in London. This tower of late years was taken down by one\r\nBuckle, a grocer, meaning in place thereof to have set up and built a\r\ngoodly frame of timber; but the said Buckle greedily labouring to pull\r\ndown the old tower, a part thereof fell upon him, which so sore bruised\r\nhim that his life was thereby shortened, and another that married his\r\nwidow set up the new prepared frame of timber, and finished the work.\r\n\r\nThis whole street called Buckles bury on both the sides throughout is\r\npossessed of grocers and apothecaries towards the west end thereof: on\r\nthe south side breaketh out one other short lane, called in records\r\nPeneritch street; it reacheth but to St. Sythe’s lane, and St. Sythe’s\r\nchurch is the farthest part thereof, for by the west end of the said\r\nchurch beginneth Needlar’s lane, which reacheth to Sopar’s lane, as is\r\naforesaid. This small parish church of St. Sith hath also an addition of\r\nBennet shorne (or Shrog or Shorehog), for by all these names have I read\r\nit, but the most ancient is Shorne, wherefore it seemeth to take that\r\nname of one Benedict Shorne, sometime a citizen and stock-fishmonger of\r\nLondon, a new builder, repairer, or benefactor thereof, in the reign\r\nof Edward II., so that Shorne is but corruptly called Shrog, and more\r\ncorruptly Shorehog.\r\n\r\nThere lie buried in this church, John Froysh, mercer, mayor 1394; John\r\nRochford and Robert Rochford; John Hold, alderman: Henry Froweke,\r\nmercer, mayor 1435; Edward Warrington; John Morrice; John Huntley;\r\nRichard Lincoln, fellmonger, 1546; Sir Ralph Warren, mercer, mayor\r\n1553; Sir John Lion, grocer, mayor 1554: these two last have monuments,\r\nthe rest are all defaced. Edward Hall, gentleman of Greyes inn, common\r\nsergeant of this city, and then under-sheriff of the same; he wrote the\r\nlarge chronicles from Richard II. till the end of Henry VIII., and was\r\nburied in this church.\r\n\r\nThen in Needelars lane have ye the parish church of St. Pancrate, a\r\nproper small church, but divers rich parishioners therein, and hath had\r\nof old time many liberal benefactors, but of late such as (not regarding\r\nthe order taken by her majesty), the least bell in their church being\r\nbroken, have rather sold the same[198] for half the value than put the\r\nparish to charge with new casting; late experience hath proved this to\r\nbe true, besides the spoil of monuments there. In this church are buried\r\nSir Aker; John Aker; John Barens, mercer, mayor 1370; John Beston and\r\nhis wife; Robert Rayland; John Hamber; John Gage; John Rowley; John\r\nLambe; John Hadley, grocer, mayor 1379; Richard Gardener, mercer, mayor\r\n1478; John Stockton, mercer, mayor 1470; John Dane, mercer; John Parker;\r\nRobert Marshall, alderman, 1439; Robert Corcheforde; Robert Hatfielde;\r\nand Robert Hatfield; Nicholas Wilfilde, and Thomas his son; the\r\nmonuments of all which be defaced and gone. There do remain of Robert\r\nBurley, 1360; Richard Wilson, 1525; Robert Packenton, mercer, slain with\r\na gun shot at him in a morning,[199] as he was going to morrow mass\r\nfrom his house in Cheape to St. Thomas of Acars, in the year 1536; the\r\nmurderer was never discovered, but by his own confession made when he\r\ncame to the gallows at Banbury to be hanged for felony; T. Wardbury,\r\nhaberdasher, 1545; James Huish, grocer, 1590; Ambrose Smith, etc. Then\r\nis a part of Soper’s lane turning up to Cheape.\r\n\r\nBy the assent of Stephen Abunden, mayor, the Pepperers in Soper’s lane\r\nwere admitted to sell all such spices and other wares as grocers now use\r\nto sell, retaining the old name of pepperers in Soper’s lane, till at\r\nlength, in the reign of Henry VI., the same Soper’s lane was inhabited\r\nby cordwainers and curriers, after that the pepperers or grocers had\r\nseated themselves in a more open street, to wit, in Buckles bury, where\r\nthey yet remain. Thus much for the south wing of Cheape ward.\r\n\r\nNow to begin again on the bank of the said Walbrooke, at the east end\r\nof the high street called the Poultrie, on the north side thereof, is\r\nthe proper parish church of St. Mildred, which church was new built upon\r\nWalbrooke in the year 1457. John Saxton their parson gave thirty-two\r\npounds towards the building of the new choir, which now standeth upon\r\nthe course of Walbrooke. Lovell and Puery, and Richard Keston, have\r\ntheir arms in the east window as benefactors. The roofing of that\r\nchurch is garnished with the arms of Thomas Archehull, one of the\r\nchurchwardens in the year 1455, who was there buried; Thomas Morsted,\r\nesquire, and chirurgeon to King Henry IV., V., and VI., one of the\r\nsheriff’s of London in the year 1436, gave unto this church a parcel\r\nof ground, containing in length from the course of Walbrooke toward the\r\nwest forty-five feet, and in breadth from the church toward the north\r\nthirty-five feet, being within the gate called Scalding wike, in the\r\nsaid parish, to make a churchyard wherein to bury their dead. Richard\r\nShore, draper, one of the sheriffs 1505, gave fifteen pounds for making\r\na porch to this church. Salomon Lanuare had a chantry there in the 14th\r\nof Edward II. Hugh Game had one other. Buried here, as appeareth by\r\nmonuments, John Hildye, poulter, 1416; John Kendall, 1468; John Garland,\r\n1476; Robert Bois, 1485, and Simon Lee, poulters, 1487; Thomas Lee of\r\nEssex, gentleman: William Hallingridge; Christopher Feliocke, 1494;\r\nRobert Draiton, skinner, 1484; John Christopherson, doctor of physic,\r\n1524; William Turner, skinner, 1536; Blase White, grocer, 1558; Thomas\r\nHobson, haberdasher, 1559; William Hobson, haberdasher, 1581; Thomas\r\nTusser, 1580, with this epitaph:--\r\n\r\n    “Here Thomas Tusser, clad in earth, doth lie,\r\n    That sometime made the Poyntes of Husbandrie;\r\n    By him then learne thou maist, here learne we must,\r\n    When all is done we sleepe and turne to dust,\r\n    And yet through Christ to heaven we hope to go,\r\n    Who reades his bookes shall find his faith was so.”\r\n\r\nOn the north side of the churchyard remain two tombs of marble, but not\r\nknown of whom, or otherwise than by tradition it is said, they were of\r\nThomas Monshampe and William, brothers, about 1547, etc.\r\n\r\nSome four houses west from this parish church of St. Mildred is a prison\r\nhouse pertaining to one of the sheriffs of London, and is called the\r\nCompter in the Poultrie. This hath been there kept and continued time\r\nout of mind, for I have not read of the original thereof. West from\r\nthis compter was a proper chapel, called of Corpus Christi, and St.\r\nMary, at Conyhope lane end, in the parish of St. Mildred, founded by one\r\nnamed Ion. Irunnes, a citizen of London, in the reign of Edward III.,\r\nin which chapel was a guild or fraternity, that might dispend in lands\r\nbetter than twenty pounds by year: it was suppressed by Henry VIII., and\r\npurchased by one Thomas Hobson, haberdasher; he turned this chapel into\r\na fair warehouse and shops towards the street, with lodgings over them.\r\n\r\nThen is Conyhope lane, of old time so called of such a sign of three\r\nconies hanging over a poulterer’s stall at the lane’s end. Within this\r\nlane standeth the Grocers’ hall, which company being of old time called\r\nPepperers, were first incorporated by the name of Grocers in the year\r\n1345, at which time they elected for custos, or guardian, of their\r\nfraternity, Richard Oswin and Laurence Haliwell, and twenty brethren\r\nwere then taken in to be of their society. In the year 1411, the custos,\r\nor guardian, and the brethren of this company, purchased of the Lord Ro.\r\nFitzwaters one plot of ground, with the building thereupon, in the said\r\nConyhope lane, for three hundred and twenty marks, and then laid the\r\nfoundation of their new common hall.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1429, the Grocers had license to purchase five hundred\r\nmarks land, since the which time, near adjoining unto the Grocers’\r\nhall, the said company had built seven proper houses for seven aged\r\npoor alms people. Thomas Knowles, grocer, mayor, gave his tenement in\r\nSt. Anthonie’s churchyard to the Grocers, towards the relief of the\r\npoor brethren in that company. Also H. Keeble, grocer, mayor, gave to\r\nthe seven alms people six pence the piece weekly forever; which pension\r\nis now increased by the masters, to some of them two shillings the\r\npiece weekly, and to some of them less, etc. Henry Adie, grocer, 1563,\r\ngave one thousand marks to the Grocers to purchase lands. And Sir John\r\nPechie, knight banneret, free of that company, gave them five hundred\r\npounds to certain uses; he built alms houses at Ludingstone in Kent, and\r\nwas there buried.\r\n\r\nWest from this Conyhope lane is the Old Jurie, whereof some portion is\r\nof Cheape ward, as afore is showed: at the south end of this lane is the\r\nparish church of St. Mary Colechurch, named of one Cole that built it;\r\nthis church is built upon a wall above ground, so that men are forced\r\nto go to ascend up thereunto by certain steps. I find no monuments of\r\nthis church, more than that Henry IV. granted license to William Marshal\r\nand others, to found a brotherhood of St. Katherine therein, because\r\nThomas Becket, and St. Edmond, the archbishop, were baptized there.\r\nMore, I read of Bordhangly lane, to be in that parish. And thus much for\r\nthe north side of the Poultrie. The south side of the said Poultrie,\r\nbeginning on the bank of the said brook over against the parish church\r\nof St. Mildred, passing up to the great conduit, hath divers fair\r\nhouses, which were sometimes inhabited by poulters, but now by grocers,\r\nhaberdashers, and upholsters.\r\n\r\nAt the west end of this Poultrie, and also of Buckles bury, beginneth\r\nthe large street of West Cheaping, a market place so called, which\r\nstreet stretcheth west till ye come to the little conduit by Paul’s\r\ngate, but not all of Chepe ward. In the east part of this street\r\nstandeth the great conduit of sweet water, conveyed by pipes of\r\nlead under ground from Paddington[200] for the service of this city,\r\ncastellated with stone, and cisterned in lead, about the year 1285, and\r\nagain new built and enlarged by Thomas Ilam, one of the sheriffs 1479.\r\n\r\nAbout the midst of this street is the Standard in Cheape, of what\r\nantiquity the first foundation I have not read. But Henry VI. by\r\nhis patent dated at Windsor the 21st of his reign, which patent was\r\nconfirmed by parliament 1442, granted license to Thomas Knolles, John\r\nChichle, and other, executors to John Wels, grocer, sometime mayor\r\nof London, with his goods to make new the highway which leadeth from\r\nthe city of London towards the palace of Westminster, before and nigh\r\nthe manor of Savoy, parcel of the Duchy of Lancaster, a way then very\r\nruinous, and the pavement broken, to the hurt and mischief of the\r\nsubjects, which old pavement then remaining in that way within the\r\nlength of five hundred feet, and all the breadth of the same before and\r\nnigh the site of the manor aforesaid, they to break up, and with stone,\r\ngravel, and other stuff, one other good and sufficient way there to make\r\nfor the commodity of the subjects.\r\n\r\nAnd further, that the Standard in Cheape, where divers executions of the\r\nlaw before time had been performed, which Standard at the present was\r\nvery ruinous with age, in which there was a conduit, should be taken\r\ndown, and another competent standard of stone, together with a conduit\r\nin the same of new, strongly to be built, for the commodity and honour\r\nof the city, with the goods of the said testator, without interruption,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nOf executions at the Standard in Cheape, we read, that in the year\r\n1293 three men had their right hands smitten off there, for rescuing\r\nof a prisoner arrested by an officer of the city. In the year 1326,\r\nthe burgesses of London caused Walter Stapleton, Bishop of Excester,\r\ntreasurer to Edward II., and other, to be beheaded at the standard in\r\nCheape (but this was by Paul’s gate); in the year 1351, the 26th of\r\nEdward III., two fishmongers were beheaded at the standard in Cheape,\r\nbut I read not of their offence; 1381, Wat Tyler beheaded Richard Lions\r\nand other there. In the year 1399, Henry IV. caused the blanch charters\r\nmade by Richard II. to be burnt there. In the year 1450, Jack Cade,\r\ncaptain of the Kentish rebels, beheaded the Lord Say there. In the\r\nyear 1461, John Davy had his hand stricken off there, because he had\r\nstricken a man before the judges at Westminster, etc.\r\n\r\nThen next is a great cross in West Cheape, which cross was there erected\r\nin the year 1290 by Edward I. upon occasion thus:--Queen Elianor his\r\nwife died at Hardeby (a town near unto the city of Lincoln), her body\r\nwas brought from thence to Westminster; and the king, in memory of her,\r\ncaused in every place where her body rested in the way, a stately cross\r\nof stone to be erected, with the queen’s image and arms upon it, as at\r\nGrantham, Woborne, Northampton, Stony Stratford, Dunstable, St. Albones,\r\nWaltham, West Cheape, and at Charing, from whence she was conveyed to\r\nWestminster, and there buried.\r\n\r\nThis cross in West Cheape being like to those other which remain to\r\nthis day, and being by length of time decayed, John Hatherly, mayor\r\nof London, procured, in the year 1441, license of King Henry VI. to\r\nre-edify the same in more beautiful manner for the honour of the city,\r\nand had license also to take up two hundred fodder of lead for the\r\nbuilding thereof of certain conduits, and a common garnery. This cross\r\nwas then curiously wrought at the charges of divers citizens: John\r\nFisher, mercer, gave six hundred marks toward it; the same was begun to\r\nbe set up 1484, and finished 1486, the 2nd of Henry VII. It was new gilt\r\nover in the year 1522, against the coming of Charles V., emperor; in\r\nthe year 1553, against the coronation of Queen Anne;[201] new burnished\r\nagainst the coronation of Edward VI.; and again new gilt 1554, against\r\nthe coming in of King Philip; since the which time the said cross having\r\nbeen presented by divers juries (or inquests of wardmote) to stand in\r\nthe high way to the let of carriages (as they alleged), but could not\r\nhave it removed, it followed that in the year 1581, the 21st of June,\r\nin the night, the lowest images round about the said cross (being of\r\nChrist’s resurrection, of the Virgin Mary, King Edward the Confessor,\r\nand such like) were broken and defaced, proclamation was made, that\r\nwho so would bewray the doers, should have forty crowns, but nothing\r\ncame to light; the image of the Blessed Virgin, at that time robbed of\r\nher Son, and her arms broken, by which she stayed him on her knees;\r\nher whole body also was haled with ropes, and left likely to fall,\r\nbut in the year 1595 was again fastened and repaired; and in the year\r\nnext following a new misshapen son, as born out of time, all naked, was\r\nlaid in her arms, the other images remaining broke as afore. But on the\r\neast side of the same cross, the steps taken thence, under the image\r\nof Christ’s resurrection defaced, was then set up a curiously wrought\r\ntabernacle of grey marble, and in the same an image alabaster of Diana,\r\nand water conveyed from the Thames prilling from her naked breast for a\r\ntime, but now decayed.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1599, the timber of the cross at the top being rotted\r\nwithin the lead, the arms thereof bending, were feared to have fallen\r\nto the harming of some people, and therefore the whole body of the\r\ncross was scaffolded about, and the top thereof taken down, meaning\r\nin place thereof to have set up a piramis; but some of her majesty’s\r\nhonourable councillors directed their letters to Sir Nicholas Mosley,\r\nthen mayor, by her highness’ express commandment concerning the cross,\r\nforthwith to be repaired, and placed again as it formerly stood, etc.;\r\nnotwithstanding the said cross stood headless more than a year after:\r\nwhereupon the said councillors, in greater number, meaning not any\r\nlonger to permit the continuance of such a contempt, wrote to William\r\nRider, then mayor, requiring him, by virtue of her highness’ said former\r\ndirection and commandment, that without any further delay to accomplish\r\nthe same her majesty’s most princely care therein, respecting especially\r\nthe antiquity and continuance of that monument, an ancient ensign of\r\nChristianity, etc. Dated the 24th of December, 1600. After this a cross\r\nof timber was framed, set up, covered with lead, and gilded, the body of\r\nthe cross downward cleansed of dust, the scaffold carried thence. About\r\ntwelve nights following, the image of Our Lady was again defaced, by\r\nplucking off her crown, and almost her head, taking from her her naked\r\nchild, and stabbing her in the breast, etc. Thus much for the cross in\r\nWest Cheape.\r\n\r\nThen at the west end of West Cheape street, was sometime a cross of\r\nstone, called the Old Cross. Raph Higden, in his _Policronicon_, saith,\r\nthat Waltar Stapleton, Bishop of Excester, treasurer to Edward II., was\r\nby the burgesses of London beheaded at this cross called the Standard,\r\nwithout the north door of St. Paul’s church; and so is it noted in other\r\nwriters that then lived. This old cross stood and remained at the east\r\nend of the parish church called St. Michael in the corner by Paule’s\r\ngate, near to the north end of the old Exchange, till the year 1390, the\r\n13th of Richard II., in place of which old cross then taken down, the\r\nsaid church of St. Michael was enlarged, and also a fair water conduit\r\nbuilt about the 9th of Henry VI.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Edward III. divers joustings were made in this street,\r\nbetwixt Sopar’s lane and the great cross, namely, one in the year 1331,\r\nthe 21st of September, as I find noted by divers writers of that time.\r\nIn the middle of the city of London (say they), in a street called\r\nCheape, the stone pavement being covered with sand, that the horses\r\nmight not slide when they strongly set their feet to the ground, the\r\nking held a tournament three days together, with the nobility, valiant\r\nmen of the realm, and other some strange knights. And to the end the\r\nbeholders might with the better ease see the same, there was a wooden\r\nscaffold erected across the street, like unto a tower, wherein Queen\r\nPhilippa, and many other ladies, richly attired, and assembled from\r\nall parts of the realm, did stand to behold the jousts; but the higher\r\nframe, in which the ladies were placed, brake in sunder, whereby they\r\nwere with some shame forced to fall down, by reason whereof the knights,\r\nand such as were underneath, were grievously hurt; wherefore the queen\r\ntook great care to save the carpenters from punishment, and through her\r\nprayers (which she made upon her knees) pacified the king and council,\r\nand thereby purchased great love of the people. After which time the\r\nking caused a shed to be strongly made of stone, for himself, the queen,\r\nand other estates to stand on, and there to behold the joustings, and\r\nother shows, at their pleasure, by the church of St. Mary Bow, as is\r\nshowed in Cordwainer street ward. Thus much for the high street of\r\nCheape.\r\n\r\nNow let us return to the south side of Cheape ward. From the great\r\nconduit west be many fair and large houses, for the most part possessed\r\nof mercers up to the corner of Cordwainer street, corruptly called\r\nBow lane, which houses in former times were but sheds or shops, with\r\nsolers[202] over them, as of late one of them remained at Sopar’s lane\r\nend, wherein a woman sold seeds, roots, and herbs; but those sheds or\r\nshops, by encroachments on the high street, are now largely built on\r\nboth sides outward, and also upward, some three, four, or five stories\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\nNow of the north side of Cheape street and ward, beginning at the great\r\nconduit, and by St. Mary Cole church, where we left. Next thereunto\r\nwestward is the Mercers’ chapel, sometime an hospital, intituled of\r\nSt. Thomas of Acon, or Acars, for a master and brethren, “_Militia\r\nhospitalis_,” etc., saith the record of Edward III., the 14th year; it\r\nwas founded by Thomas Fitzthebald de Heili, and Agnes his wife, sister\r\nto Thomas Becket, in the reign of Henry II.; they gave to the master\r\nand brethren the lands, with the appurtenances that sometimes were\r\nGilbart Becket’s, father to the said Thomas, in the which he was born,\r\nthere to make a church. There was a charnel, and a chapel over it, of\r\nSt. Nicholas and St. Stephen. This hospital was valued to dispend £277\r\n3_s._ 4_d._, surrendered the 30th of Henry VIII.: the 21st of October,\r\nand was since purchased by the Mercers, by means of Sir Richard Gresham,\r\nand was again set open on the eve of St. Michael, 1541, the 33rd of\r\nHenry VIII.: it is now called the Mercers’ chapel; therein is kept a\r\nfree grammar school, as of old time had been accustomed, commanded by\r\nparliament.[203] Here be many monuments remaining, but more have been\r\ndefaced:--James Butler, Earl of Ormond, and Dame Joan his countess,\r\n1428; John Norton, esquire; Stephen Cavendish, draper, mayor 1362;\r\nThomas Cavendish; William Cavendish; Thomas Ganon, called Pike, one\r\nof the sheriffs 1410; Hungate, of Yorkshire; Ambrose Cresacre; John\r\nChester, draper; John Trusbut, mercer, 1437; Tho. Norland, sheriff 1483;\r\nSir Edmond Sha, goldsmith, mayor 1482; Sir Thomas Hill, mayor 1485;\r\nThomas Ilam, sheriff 1479;[204] Lancelot Laken, esquire; Raph Tilney,\r\nsheriff 1488; Garth, esquire; John Rich; Thomas Butler, Earl of Ormond,\r\n1515; Sir W. Butler, grocer, mayor 1515; W. Browne, mercer, mayor 1513;\r\nJohn Loke, 1519;[205] Sir T. Baldry, mercer, mayor 1523; Sir W. Locke,\r\nmercer, sheriff 1548; Sir John Allen, mercer, mayor 1525, deceased 1544;\r\nSir Thomas Leigh, mercer, mayor 1558; Sir Richard Malory, mercer, mayor\r\n1564; Humf. Baskervile, mercer, sheriff 1561; Sir G. Bond, mayor 1587;\r\netc.\r\n\r\nBefore this hospital, towards the street, was built a fair and beautiful\r\nchapel, arched over with stone, and thereupon the Mercers’ hall, a most\r\ncurious piece of work; Sir John Allen, mercer, being founder of that\r\nchapel, was there buried; but since his tomb is removed thence into the\r\nbody of the hospital church, and his chapel, divided into shops, is\r\nletten out for rent.\r\n\r\nThese Mercers were enabled to be a company, and to purchase lands to\r\nthe value of twenty pounds the year, the 17th of Richard II.; they\r\nhad three messuages and shops in the parish of St. Martin Oteswitch,\r\nin the ward of Bishopsgate, for the sustentation of the poor, and a\r\nchantry of the 22nd of Richard II. Henry IV., in the 12th of his reign,\r\nconfirmed to Stephen Spilman, W. Marchford, and John Whatile, mercers,\r\nby the name of one new seldam, shed, or building, with shops, cellars,\r\nand edifices whatsoever appertaining called Crownsild, situate in the\r\nMercery in West Cheape, in the parish of St. Mary de Arcubus in London,\r\netc., to be holden in burgage, as all the city of London is, and which\r\nwere worth by year in all issues, according to the true value of them,\r\n£7 13_s._ 4_d._, as found by inquisition before T. Knolles, mayor, and\r\nescheator in the said city. Henry VI., in the 3rd of his reign, at the\r\nrequest of John Coventrie, John Carpenter, and William Grove, granted\r\nto the Mercers to have a chaplain and a brotherhood, for relief of such\r\nof their company as came to decay by misfortune on the sea. In the year\r\n1536, on St. Peter’s night, King Henry VIII. and Queen Jane his wife,\r\nstood in this Mercers’ hall, then new built, and beheld the marching\r\nwatch of this city most bravely set out, Sir John Allen, mercer, one of\r\nthe king’s council, being mayor.\r\n\r\nNext beyond the Mercers’ chapel, and their hall, is Ironmonger lane, so\r\ncalled of ironmongers dwelling there, whereof I read, in the reign of\r\nEdward I., etc. In this lane is the small parish church of St. Martin\r\ncalled Pomary, upon what occasion I certainly know not. It is supposed\r\nto be of apples growing where houses are now lately built; for myself\r\nhave seen large void places there. Monuments in that church none to be\r\naccounted of.\r\n\r\nFarther west is St. Laurence lane, so called of St. Laurence church,\r\nwhich standeth directly over against the north end thereof. Antiquities\r\nin this lane I find none other, than that among many fair houses, there\r\nis one large inn for receipt of travellers called Blossoms inn, but\r\ncorruptly Bosoms inn, and hath to sign St. Laurence the Deacon, in a\r\nborder of blossoms or flowers.\r\n\r\nThen near to the Standard in Cheape is Honey lane, so called, not of\r\nsweetness thereof, being very narrow, and somewhat dark, but rather of\r\noften washing and sweeping, to keep it clean. In this lane is the small\r\nparish church called Alhallows in Honey lane; there be no monuments in\r\nthis church worth the noting. I find that John Norman, draper, mayor\r\n1453, was buried there; he gave to the Drapers his tenements on the\r\nnorth side the said church, they to allow for the beam light and lamp,\r\n13_s._ 4_d._ yearly from this lane to the Standard. And thus much for\r\nCheape ward in the high street of Cheape, for it stretcheth no farther.\r\n\r\nNow for the north wing of Cheape ward have ye Catte street, corruptly\r\ncalled Catteten street, which beginneth at the north end of Ironmonger\r\nlane, and runneth to the west end of St. Lawrence church, as is afore\r\nshowed.\r\n\r\nOn the north side of the street is the Guildhall, wherein the courts\r\nfor the city be kept, namely, 1. The court of common council; 2. The\r\ncourt of the lord mayor and his brethren the aldermen; 3. The court\r\nof hustings; 4. The court of orphans; 5. The court of the sheriff; 6.\r\nThe court of the wardmote; 7. The court of hallmote; 8. The court of\r\nrequests, commonly called the court of conscience; 9. The chamberlain’s\r\ncourt for apprentices, and making them free. This Guildhall, saith\r\nRobert Fabian, was begun to be built new in the year 1411, the 12th of\r\nHenry IV., by Thomas Knoles, then mayor, and his brethren the aldermen:\r\nthe same was made, of a little cottage, a large and great house, as\r\nnow it standeth; towards the charges whereof the companies gave large\r\nbenevolences; also offences of men were pardoned for sums of money\r\ntowards this work, extraordinary fees were raised, fines, amercements,\r\nand other things employed during seven years, with a continuation\r\nthereof three years more, all to be employed to this building.\r\n\r\nThe 1st year of Henry VI., John Coventrie and John Carpenter, executors\r\nto Richard Whitington, gave towards the paving of this great hall twenty\r\npounds, and the next year fifteen pounds more, to the said pavement,\r\nwith hard stone of Purbeck; they also glazed some windows thereof,\r\nand of the mayor’s court; on every which windows the arms of Richard\r\nWhitington are placed. The foundation of the mayor’s court was laid in\r\nthe 3rd year of the reign of Henry VI., and of the porch on the south\r\nside of the mayor’s court, in the 4th of the said king. Then was built\r\nthe mayor’s chamber, and the council chamber, with other rooms above the\r\nstairs; last of all a stately porch entering the great hall was erected,\r\nthe front thereof towards the south being beautified with images of\r\nstone, such as is showed by these verses following, made about some\r\nthirty years since by William Elderton, at that time an attorney in the\r\nsheriffs’ courts there:--\r\n\r\n    “Though most of the images be pulled down,\r\n    And none be thought remayne in towne,\r\n    I am sure there be in London yet,\r\n    Seven images in such and in such a place;\r\n    And few or none I think will hit,\r\n    Yet every day they show their face,\r\n    And thousands see them every year,\r\n    But few I thinke can tell me where,\r\n    Where Jesu Christ aloft doth stand:\r\n    Law and Learning on eyther hand,\r\n    Discipline in the Devil’s necke,\r\n    And hard by her are three direct,\r\n    There Justice, Fortitude, and Temperance stand,\r\n    Where find ye the like in all this land?”\r\n\r\nDivers aldermen glazed the great hall and other courts, as appeareth\r\nby their arms in each window. William Hariot, draper, mayor 1481, gave\r\nforty pounds to the making of two loovers in the said Guildhall, and\r\ntowards the glazing thereof. The kitchens and other houses of office\r\nadjoining to this Guildhall, were built of later time, to wit, about\r\nthe year 1501, by procurement of Sir John Sha, goldsmith, mayor (who\r\nwas the first that kept his feast there); towards the charges of\r\nwhich work the mayor had of the fellowships of the city, by their own\r\nagreement, certain sums of money, as of the Mercers forty pounds, the\r\nGrocers twenty pounds, the Drapers thirty pounds, and so of the other\r\nfellowships through the city, as they were of power. Also widows and\r\nother well-disposed persons gave certain sums of money, as the Lady\r\nHill ten pounds, the Lady Austrie ten pounds, and so of many other,\r\ntill the work was finished, since the which time the mayor’s feasts\r\nhave been yearly kept there, which before time had been kept in the\r\nTailors’ hall, and in the Grocers’ hall. Nicholas Alwyn, grocer, mayor\r\n1499, deceased 1505, gave by his testament for a hanging of tapestry,\r\nto serve for principal days in the Guildhall, £73 6_s._ 8_d._ How this\r\ngift was performed I have not heard, for executors of our time having no\r\nconscience (I speak of my own knowledge) prove more testaments than they\r\nperform.\r\n\r\nNow for the chapel or college of our Lady Mary Magdalen, and of All\r\nSaints, by the Guildhall, called London college, I read that the same\r\nwas built about the year 1299, and that Peter Fanelore, Adam Frauncis,\r\nand Henry Frowike, citizens, gave one messuage, with the appurtenances,\r\nin the parish of St. Fawstar, to William Brampton, custos of the\r\nchantry, by them founded in the said chapel with four chaplains, and one\r\nother house in the parish of St. Giles without Cripplegate, in the 27th\r\nof Edward III., was given to them. Moreover, I find that Richard II., in\r\nthe 20th of his reign, granted to Stephen Spilman, mercer, license to\r\ngive one messuage, three shops, and one garden, with the appurtenances,\r\nbeing in the parish of St. Andrew Hubbard, to the custos and chaplains\r\nof the said chapel, and to their successors, for their better relief and\r\nmaintenance for ever.\r\n\r\nKing Henry VI., in the 8th of his reign, gave license to John Barnard,\r\ncustos, and the chaplains, to build of new the said chapel or college of\r\nGuildhall: and the same Henry VI., in the 27th of his reign, granted to\r\nthe parish clerks in London a guild of St. Nicholas, for two chaplains\r\nby them to be kept in the said chapel of St. Mary Magdalen, near unto\r\nthe Guildhall, and to keep seven alms people. Henry Barton, skinner,\r\nmayor, founded a chaplaincy there; Roger Depham, mercer, and Sir William\r\nLangford, knight, had also chaplaincies there. This chapel or college\r\nhad a custos, seven chaplains, three clerks, and four choristers.\r\n\r\nMonuments there have been sundry, as appeareth by the tombs of marble\r\nyet remaining, seven in number, but all defaced. The uppermost in the\r\nchoir, on the south side thereof, above the revestry door, was the tomb\r\nof John Wells, grocer, mayor 1451. The likeness of Wells are graven\r\non the tomb on the revestry door, and other places on that side the\r\nchoir. Also in the glass window over this tomb, and in the east window,\r\nis the likeness of Wells, with hands elevated out of the same Wells,\r\nholding scrolls, wherein is written “Mercy!”--the writing in the east\r\nwindow being broken, yet remaineth Wells. I found his arms also in the\r\nsouth glass window; all which do show that the east end and south side\r\nthe choir of this chapel, and the revestry, were by him both built\r\nand glazed. On the north side the choir the tomb of Thomas Knesworth,\r\nfishmonger, mayor 1505, who deceased 1515, was defaced, and within these\r\nforty-four years again renewed by the Fishmongers. Two other tombs lower\r\nthere are; the one of a draper, the other of a haberdasher, their names\r\nnot known. Richard Stomine is written in the window by the haberdasher.\r\nUnder flat stones do lie divers custos of the chapel, chaplains and\r\nofficers to the chamber. Amongst others, John Clipstone, priest,\r\nsometime custos of the library of the Guildhall, 1457; another of Edmond\r\nAlison, priest, one of the custos of the library, 1510, etc. Sir John\r\nLangley, goldsmith, mayor 1576, lieth buried in the vault, under the\r\ntomb of John Wells before-named. This chapel, or college, valued to\r\ndispend £15 8_s._ 9_d._ by the year, was surrendered amongst other: the\r\nchapel remaineth to the mayor and commonalty, wherein they have service\r\nweekly, as also at the election of the mayor, and at the mayor’s feast,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nAdjoining to this chapel, on the south side, was sometime a fair and\r\nlarge library, furnished with books, pertaining to the Guildhall and\r\ncollege. These books, as it is said, were in the reign of Edward VI.\r\nsent for by Edward, Duke of Somerset, lord protector, with promise to\r\nbe restored: men laded from thence three carries with them, but they\r\nwere never returned. This library was built by the executors of Richard\r\nWhittington, and by William Burie: the arms of Whittington are placed on\r\nthe one side in the stone work, and two letters, to wit, W. and B., for\r\nWilliam Bury, on the other side: it is now lofted through, and made a\r\nstorehouse for clothes.\r\n\r\nSouth-west from this Guildhall is the fair parish church of St.\r\nLaurence, called in the Jury, because of old time[206] many Jews\r\ninhabited thereabout. This church is fair and large, and hath some\r\nmonuments, as shall be shown. I myself, more than seventy years\r\nsince,[207] have seen in this church the shank-bone of a man (as it\r\nis taken), and also a tooth,[208] of a very great bigness, hanged up\r\nfor show in chains of iron, upon a pillar of stone; the tooth (being\r\nabout the bigness of a man’s fist) is long since conveyed from thence:\r\nthe thigh, or shank-bone, of twenty-five inches in length by the rule,\r\nremaineth yet fastened to a post of timber, and is not so much to be\r\nnoted for the length as for the thickness, hardness, and strength\r\nthereof; for when it was hanged on the stone pillar it fretted with\r\nmoving the said pillar, and was not itself fretted, nor, as seemeth,\r\nis not yet lightened by remaining dry; but where or when this bone was\r\nfirst found or discovered I have not heard, and therefore, rejecting\r\nthe fables of some late writers, I overpass them. Walter Blundell\r\nhad a chantry there, the 14th of Edward II. There lie buried in this\r\nchurch--Elizabeth, wife to John Fortescue; Katherine Stoketon; John\r\nStratton; Philip Albert; John Fleming; Philip Agmondesham; William\r\nSkywith; John Norlong; John Baker; Thomas Alleyne; William Barton,\r\nmercer, 1410; William Melrith, mercer, one of the sheriffs, 1425; Simon\r\nBartlet, mercer, 1428; Walter Chartsey, draper, one of the sheriffs\r\n1430; Richard Rich, esquire, of London, the father, and Richard Rich,\r\nhis son, mercer, one of the sheriffs 1442, deceased 1469, with this\r\nepitaph:\r\n\r\n    “Respice quod opus est præsentis temporis æuum,\r\n        Omne quod est, nihil est præter amare Deum.”\r\n\r\nThis Richard was father to John, buried in St. Thomas Acars, which\r\nJohn was father to Thomas, father to Richard Lord Ritch, etc.; John\r\nPickering, honourable for service of his prince and for the English\r\nmerchants beyond the seas, who deceased 1448; Godfrey Bollen, mercer,\r\nmayor 1457; Thomas Bollen, his son, esquire, of Norfolk, 1471; John\r\nAtkenson, gentleman; Dame Mary St. Maure; John Waltham; Roger Bonifant;\r\nJohn Chayhee; John Abbot; Geffrey Filding, mayor 1452, and Angell his\r\nwife; Simon Benington, draper, and Joan his wife; John Marshal, mercer,\r\nmayor 1493; William Purchat, mayor 1498; Thomas Burgoyne, gentleman,\r\nmercer, 1517; the wife of a master of defence, servant to the Princess\r\nof Wales, Duchess of Cornwall, and Countess of Chester;[209] Sir Richard\r\nGresham, mayor 1537; Sir Michell Dormer, mayor 1541; Robert Charsey, one\r\nof the sheriffs 1548; Sir William Row, ironmonger, mayor 1593; Samuel\r\nThornhill, 1397. Thus much for Cheape ward, which hath an alderman,\r\nhis deputy, common councillors eleven, constables eleven, scavengers\r\nnine, for the wardmote inquest twelve, and a beadle. It is taxed to the\r\nfifteen at £72 16_s._, and in the Exchequer at £52 11_s._[210]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[198] “Justices charged to punish such as sel bels from their churches,\r\nElizabeth 14.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\n[199] “The 13th of November.”--_1st edition_, p. 210.\r\n\r\n[200] “This conduite was the first sweete water that was conveyed\r\nby pipes of lead under ground to this place in the citie from\r\nPaddington.”--_1st edition_, p. 210.\r\n\r\n[201] This is obviously an error. It occurs in the first edition, is\r\nrepeated in that of 1603, and by Anthony Munday, in his edition of 1618.\r\nStrype (vol. i. book iii. p. 35), endeavours to correct it, by reading\r\n“Mary,” who was crowned in 1553, instead of Anne. The error, however, is\r\nin the date, which should be 1533, the year of Anne Boleyn’s coronation,\r\nas we learn from the description of that ceremony given by Stow in his\r\n_Annals_, “that she went forward by the crosse which was _newly gilt_.”\r\n\r\n[202] _Soler_ is described by Tyrwhitt, in his edition of Chaucer’s\r\n_Canterbury Tales_, as originally signifying an open gallery or balcony\r\nat the top of the house, though latterly used for any upper room, loft,\r\nor garret. Tyrwhitt refers in his Glossary, to the _Cook’s Tale of\r\nGamelyn_, for an authority for the use of the word in the latter sense--\r\n\r\n    “He fleigh up until alofte,\r\n      And shet the dore fast.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    And saugh where he looked out\r\n      At a _solere_ window.”\r\n\r\nThe German _Söller_ is used by Luther in his magnificent translation\r\nof the Bible in both senses:--“Peter went up upon the house-top to\r\npray”--“_Stieg Petrus hinauf auf den SÖLLER zu beten._” Acts x. 9. “And\r\nwhen they were come in, they went up into an upper room”--“_Und als sie\r\nhinein kamen, stiegen sie auf den SÖLLER._” Acts i. 13.\r\n\r\n[203] “There is also a preaching in the Italian tongue to the Italians\r\nand others on the Sondaies.”--_1st edition_, p. 214.\r\n\r\n[204] “Henry Frowicke.”--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n[205] “Locke his armes in the windowes.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\n[206] Because “of old time, since the raigne of William the Conqueror\r\n(that first brought Jewes from Roan into this realme), many Jewes\r\ninhabited thereabouts, until that in the year 1290, the 18th of Edw. I.,\r\nthey were wholly and for ever by the said king banished this realme,\r\nhaving of their owne goodes to beare their charges, till they were out\r\nof dominions. The number of the Jewes at that time banished were 15,060\r\npersons, whose houses being sold, the king made of them a mightie masse\r\nof money.”--_1st edition_, p. 219.\r\n\r\n[207] “Sixty years since.”--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n[208] “The tooth of some monstrous fish, as I take it.

On the\r\nnorth side lieth Coleman street, whereof the ward taketh name, wholly\r\non both sides north to London wall, and from that north end along by\r\nthe wall, and Moregate east, to the course of Walbrook; and again from\r\nColeman street west to the iron grates: and these be the bounds of this\r\nward.\r\n\r\nAntiquities to be noted therein are these: First, the street of\r\nLothberie, Lathberie, or Loadberie (for by all these names have I read\r\nit), took the name (as it seemeth) of berie, or court of old time there\r\nkept, but by whom is grown out of memory. This street is possessed for\r\nthe most part by founders, that cast candlesticks, chafing-dishes, spice\r\nmortars, and such like copper or laton works, and do afterward turn them\r\nwith the foot, and not with the wheel, to make them smooth and bright\r\nwith turning and scrating (as some do term it), making a loathsome noise\r\nto the by-passers that have not been used to the like, and therefore by\r\nthem disdainfully called Lothberie.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of this street, amongst the founders, be some fair\r\nhouses and large for merchants, namely, one that of old time was the\r\nJews’ synagogue, which was defaced by the citizens of London, after\r\nthat they had slain seven hundred Jews, and spoiled the residue of\r\ntheir goods, in the year 1262, the 47th of Henry III. And not long\r\nafter, in the year 1291, King Edward I. banished the remnant of the\r\nJews out of England, as is afore showed. The said synagogue being so\r\nsuppressed, certain friars got possession thereof; “for in the year\r\n1257,” saith Mathew Paris, “there were seen in London a new order of\r\nfriars, called _De Pœnitentia Jesu_, or _Fratres de Sacca_, because\r\nthey were apparelled in sackcloth, who had their house in London, near\r\nunto Aldersgate without the gate, and had license of Henry III., in the\r\n54th of his reign, to remove from thence to any other place; and in the\r\n56th he gave unto them this Jews’ synagogue; after which time, Elianor\r\nthe queen, wife to Edward I., took into her protection, and warranted\r\nunto the prior and brethren _De Penitentia Jesu Christi_ of London,\r\nthe said land and building in Colechurch street, in the parish of St.\r\nOlave in the Jury, and St. Margaret in Lothbery, by her granted, with\r\nconsent of Stephen de Fulbourne, under-warden of the Bridge-house, and\r\nother brethren of that house, for sixty marks of silver, which they had\r\nreceived of the said prior and brethren of repentance, to the building\r\nof the said bridge.” This order of friars gathered many good scholars,\r\nand multiplied in number exceedingly, until the council at Lyons, by\r\nthe which it was decreed, that from that time forth there should be no\r\nmore orders of begging friars permitted, but only the four orders; to\r\nwit, the Dominicke, or preachers, the Minorites, or grey friars, the\r\nCarmelites, or white friars, and the Augustines: and so from that time\r\nthe begging friars deceased, and fell to nothing.\r\n\r\nNow it followed, that in the year 1305, Robert Fitzwalter requested\r\nand obtained of the said King Edward I., that the same friars of the\r\nSacke might assign to the said Robert their chapel or church, of old\r\ntime called the Synagogue of the Jews, near adjoining to the then\r\nmansion place of the same Robert, which was in place where now standeth\r\nthe Grocers’ hall; and the said Synagogue was at the north corner of\r\nthe Old Jury. Robert Large, mercer, mayor in the year 1439, kept his\r\nmayoralty in this house, and dwelt there until his dying day. This\r\nhouse standeth, and is of two parishes, as opening into Lothberie, of\r\nSt. Margaret’s parish, and opening into the Old Jury of St. Olave’s\r\nparish. The said Robert Large gave liberally to both these parishes, but\r\nwas buried at St. Olave’s. Hugh Clopton, mercer, mayor 1492, dwelt in\r\nthis house, and kept his mayoralty there: it is now a tavern, and hath\r\nto sign a windmill. And thus much for this house, sometime the Jews’\r\nsynagogue, since a house of friars, then a nobleman’s house, after that\r\na merchant’s house, wherein mayoralties have been kept, and now a wine\r\ntavern.\r\n\r\nThen is the Old Jurie, a street so called of Jews sometime dwelling\r\nthere, and near adjoining, in the parishes of St. Olave, St. Michael\r\nBasings hall, St. Martin Ironmonger lane, St. Lawrence, called the Jury,\r\nand so west to Wood street. William, Duke of Normandy, first brought\r\nthem from Rouen to inhabit here.\r\n\r\nWilliam Rufus favoured them so far, that he sware by Luke’s face, his\r\ncommon oath, if they could overcome the Christians, he would be one of\r\ntheir sect.\r\n\r\nHenry II. grievously punished them for corrupting his coin.\r\n\r\nRichard I. forbad Jews and women to be present at his coronation, for\r\nfear of enchantments; for breaking of which commandment many Jews\r\nwere slain, who being assembled to present the king with some gift,\r\none of them was stricken by a Christian, which some unruly people\r\nperceiving, fell upon them, beat them to their houses, and burnt them\r\ntherein, or slew them at their coming out. Also the Jews at Norwich,\r\nSt. Edmondsbury, Lincoln, Stamford, and Lynne, were robbed and spoiled;\r\nand at York, to the number of five hundred, besides women and children,\r\nentered a tower of the castle, proffered money to be in surety of their\r\nlives, but the Christians would not take it, whereupon they cut the\r\nthroats of their wives and children, and cast them over the walls on the\r\nChristians’ heads, and then entering the king’s lodging, they burnt both\r\nthe house and themselves.\r\n\r\nKing John, in the 11th of his reign, commanded all the Jews, both men\r\nand women, to be imprisoned and grievously punished, because he would\r\nhave all their money: some of them gave all they had, and promised more,\r\nto escape so many kinds of torments, for every one of them had one of\r\ntheir eyes at the least plucked out; amongst whom there was one, which\r\nbeing tormented many ways, would not ransom himself, till the king had\r\ncaused every day one of his great teeth to be plucked out by the space\r\nof seven days, and then gave the king ten thousand marks of silver, to\r\nthe end they should pull out no more: the said king at that time spoiled\r\nthe Jews of sixty-six thousand marks.\r\n\r\nThe 17th of this king, the barons brake into the Jews’ houses, rifled\r\ntheir coffers, and with the stone of their houses repaired the gates and\r\nwalls of London.\r\n\r\nKing Henry III., in the 11th of his reign, granted to Semayne, or\r\nBalaster, the house of Benonye Mittun the Jew, in the parish of St.\r\nMichael Bassinghaughe, in which the said Benonye dwelt, with the fourth\r\npart of all his land, in that parish which William Elie held of the fee\r\nof Hugh Nevell, and all the land in Coleman street belonging to the said\r\nBenonye, and the fourth part of the land in the parish of St. Lawrence,\r\nwhich was the fee of T. Buckerell, and were escheated to the king for\r\nthe murder which the said Benonye committed in the city of London, to\r\nhold to the said Semaine, and his heirs, of the king, paying at Easter\r\na pair of gilt spurs, and to do the service thereof due unto the lord’s\r\ncourt. In like manner, and for like services, the king granted to Guso\r\nfor his homage the other part of the lands of the said Bononye in St.\r\nMichael’s parish, which lands that Paynter held, and was the king’s\r\nescheat, and the lands of the said Bononye in the said parish, which\r\nWaltar Turnar held, and fifteen feet of land, which Hugh Harman held,\r\nwith fifteen iron ells of land, and half in the front of Ironmonger\r\nlane, in the parish of St. Martin, which were the said Bononies of the\r\nfee of the hospital of St. Giles, and which Adam the smith held, with\r\ntwo stone-houses, which were Moses’, the Jew of Canterbury, in the\r\nparish of St. Olave, and which are of the fee of Arnold le Reus, and are\r\nthe king’s escheats as before said.\r\n\r\nThe 16th of the said Henry, the Jews in London built a synagogue, but\r\nthe king commanded it should be dedicated to our Blessed Lady, and\r\nafter gave it to the brethren of St. Anthonie of Vienna, and so was it\r\ncalled St. Anthonie’s hospital: this Henry founded a church and house\r\nfor converted Jews in New street, by the Temple, whereby it came to\r\npass that in short time there was gathered a great number of converts.\r\nThe 20th of this Henry, seven Jews were brought from Norwich, which\r\nhad stolen a christened child, had circumcised, and minded to have\r\ncrucified him at Easter, wherefore their bodies and goods were at the\r\nking’s pleasure: the 26th, the Jews were constrained to pay to the king\r\ntwenty thousand marks, at two terms in the year, or else to be kept\r\nin perpetual prison: the 35th, he taketh inestimable sums of money of\r\nall rich men, namely, of Aaron, a Jew, born at York, fourteen thousand\r\nmarks for himself and ten thousand marks for the queen; and before he\r\nhad taken of the same Jew as much as in all amounted to thirty thousand\r\nmarks of silver, and two hundred marks of gold to the queen: in the\r\n40th, were brought up to Westminster two hundred and two Jews from\r\nLincoln, for crucifying of a child named Hugh; eighteen of them were\r\nhanged: the 43rd, a Jew at Tewkesbery fell into a privy on the Saturday,\r\nand would not that day be taken out for reverence of his Sabbath;\r\nwherefore Richard Clare, Earl of Gloucester, kept him there till Monday,\r\nthat he was dead: the 47th, the barons slew the Jews at London seven\r\nhundred; the rest were spoiled, and their synagogue defaced, because one\r\nJew would have forced a Christian to have paid more than two pence for\r\nthe loan of twenty shillings a week.\r\n\r\nThe 3rd of Edward I., in a parliament at London, usury was forbidden\r\nto the Jews; and that all usurers might be known, the king commanded\r\nthat every usurer should wear a table on his breast, the breadth of a\r\npaveline, or else to avoid the realm. The 6th of the said King Edward\r\na reformation was made for clipping of the king’s coin, for which\r\noffence two hundred and sixty-seven Jews were drawn and hanged; three\r\nwere English Christians, and other were English Jews: the same year the\r\nJews crucified a child at Northampton, for the which fact many Jews at\r\nLondon were drawn at horse-tails and hanged. The 11th of Edward I., John\r\nPerkham, Archbishop of Canterbury, commanded the Bishop of London to\r\ndestroy all the Jews’ synagogues in his diocese. The 16th of the said\r\nEdward, all the Jews in England were in one day apprehended by precept\r\nfrom the king, but they redeemed themselves for twelve thousand pounds\r\nof silver; notwithstanding, in the 19th of his reign, he banished them\r\nall out of England, giving them only to bear their charge, till they\r\nwere out of his realm: the number of Jews then expulsed were fifteen\r\nthousand and sixty persons. The king made a mighty mass of money of\r\ntheir houses, which he sold, and yet the commons of England had granted\r\nand gave him a fifteenth of all their goods to banish them: and thus\r\nmuch for the Jews.\r\n\r\nIn this said street, called the Old Jury, is a proper parish church\r\nof St. Olave Upwell, so called in record, 1320. John Brian, parson of\r\nSt. Olave Upwell, in the Jury, founded there a chantry, and gave two\r\nmessuages to that parish, the 16th of Edward II., and was by the said\r\nking confirmed. In this church,[211] to the commendation of the parsons\r\nand parishioners, the monuments of the dead remain less defaced than in\r\nmany other: first, of William Dikman, fereno or ironmonger, one of the\r\nsheriffs of London 1367; Robert Haveloke, ironmonger, 1390; John Organ,\r\nmercer, one of the sheriffs 1385; John Forest, vicar of St. Olave’s, and\r\nof St. Stephen, at that time as a chapel annexed to St. Olave, 1399;\r\nH. Friole, tailor, 1400; T. Morsted, esquire, chirurgeon to Henry IV.,\r\nV., and VI., one of the sheriffs, 1436: he built a fair new aisle to\r\nthe enlargement of this church, on the north side thereof, wherein he\r\nlieth buried, 1450; Adam Breakspeare, chaplain, 1411; William Kerkbie,\r\nmercer, 1465; Robert Large, mercer, mayor 1440; he gave to that church\r\ntwo hundred pounds; John Belwine, founder, 1467; Gabriel Rave, fuller,\r\n1511; Wentworth, esquire, 1510; Thomas Michell, ironmonger, 1527;\r\nGiles Dewes, servant to Henry VII. and to Henry VIII., clerk of their\r\nlibraries, and schoolmaster for the French tongue to Prince Arthur and\r\nto the Lady Mary, 1535; Richard Chamberlaine, ironmonger, one of the\r\nsheriffs, 1562; Edmond Burlacy, mercer, 1583; John Brian, etc.\r\n\r\nFrom this parish church of St. Olave, to the north end of the Old Jewry,\r\nand from thence west to the north end of Ironmongers’ lane, and from\r\nthe said corner into Ironmongers’ lane, almost to the parish church of\r\nSt. Martin, was of old time one large building of stone, very ancient,\r\nmade in place of Jews’ houses, but of what antiquity, or by whom the\r\nsame was built, or for what use, I have not learnt, more than that King\r\nHenry VI., in the 16th of his reign, gave the office of being porter or\r\nkeeper thereof unto John Stent for term of his life, by the name of his\r\nprincipal palace in the Old Jury: this was in my youth called the old\r\nWardrobe, but of later time the outward stone wall hath been by little\r\nand little taken down, and divers fair houses built thereupon, even\r\nround about.\r\n\r\nNow for the north side of this Lothburie, beginning again at the east\r\nend thereof, upon the water-course of Walbrooke, have ye a proper parish\r\nchurch called St. Margaret, which seemeth to be newly re-edified and\r\nbuilt about the year 1440; for Robert Large gave to the choir of that\r\nchurch one hundred shillings and twenty pounds for ornaments; more, to\r\nthe vaulting over the water-course of Walbrook by the said church, for\r\nthe enlarging thereof two hundred marks.\r\n\r\nThere be monuments in this church,--of Reginald Coleman, son to Robert\r\nColeman, buried there 1483: this said Robert Coleman may be supposed\r\nthe first builder or owner of Coleman street, and that St. Stephen’s\r\nchurch, then built in Coleman street, was but a chapel belonging to the\r\nparish church of St. Olave in the Jury; for we read (as afore) that John\r\nForest, vicar of St. Olave’s, and of the chapel annexed of St. Stephen,\r\ndeceased in the year 1399.[212] Hugh Clopton, mercer, mayor, deceased\r\n1496; John Dimocke, Anselme Becker, John Julian, and William Ilford,\r\nchantries there; Sir Brian Tewke, knight, treasurer of the chamber to\r\nKing Henry VIII., and Dame Grisilde his wife, that deceased after him,\r\nwere there buried 1536; John Fetiplace, draper, esquire, 1464, and Joan\r\nhis wife; Sir Hugh Witch, mercer, mayor, son to Richard Witch, entombed\r\nthere 1466: he gave to his third wife three thousand pounds, and to\r\nmaids’ marriages five hundred marks; Sir John Leigh, 1564, with this\r\nepitaph:\r\n\r\n    “No wealth, no prayse, no bright renowne, no skill,\r\n    No force, no fame, no princes loue, no toyle,\r\n    Though forraigne land by trauell search ye will,\r\n    No faithfull seruice of the country soyle,\r\n    Can life prolong one minute of an houre,\r\n    But death at length will execute his power;\r\n    For Sir John Leigh to sundry countries knowne,\r\n    A worthy knight well of his prince esteemde,\r\n    By seeing much, to great experience growne,\r\n    Though safe on seas, though sure on land he seemde,\r\n    Yet here he lyes too soone by death opprest,\r\n    His fame yet liues, his soule in heauen doth rest.”\r\n\r\nBy the west end of this parish church have ye a fair water conduit,\r\nbuilt at the charges of the city in the year 1546. Sir Martin Bowes\r\nbeing mayor, two fifteens were levied of the citizens toward the charges\r\nthereof. This water is conveyed in great abundance from divers springs\r\nlying betwixt Hoxton and Iseldon.\r\n\r\nNext is the Founders’ hall, a proper house, and so to the south-west\r\ncorner of Bassinges hall street, have ye fair and large houses for\r\nmerchants; namely, the corner house at the end of Bassinges hall street;\r\nan old piece of work, built of stone, sometime belonging to a certain\r\nJew named Mansere, the son of Aaron, the son of Coke the Jew, the 7th\r\nof Edward I.; since to Rahere de Sopar’s lane, then to Simon Francis.\r\nThomas Bradbery, mercer, kept his mayoralty there; deceased 1509. Part\r\nof this house hath been lately employed as a market-house for the sale\r\nof woollen bays, watmols, flannels, and such like. Alderman Bennet now\r\npossesseth it.\r\n\r\nOn this north side against the Old Jury is Coleman street, so called of\r\nColeman, the first builder and owner thereof; as also of Colechurch,\r\nor Coleman church, against the great conduit in Cheape. This is a fair\r\nand large street, on both sides built with divers fair houses, besides\r\nalleys, with small tenements in great number. On the east side of this\r\nstreet, almost at the north end thereof, is the Armourers’ hall, which\r\ncompany of armourers were made a fraternity or guild of St George, with\r\na chantry in the chapel of St. Thomas in Paule’s church, in the 1st of\r\nHenry VI. Also on the same side is King’s alley and Love lane, both\r\ncontaining many tenements; and on the west side, towards the south end,\r\nis the parish church of St. Stephen, wherein the monuments are defaced:\r\nnotwithstanding, I find that William Crayhag founded a chantry there in\r\nthe reign of Edward II., and was buried there:[213] also John Essex,\r\nthe 35th of Edward III.; Adam Goodman, the 37th of Edward III.; William\r\nKing, draper, sometime owner of King’s alley, the 18th of Richard II.;\r\nJohn Stokeling, the 10th of Henry VI.; John Arnold, leather-seller, the\r\n17th of Henry VI.; Thomas Bradberie, mercer, mayor, the 1st of Henry\r\nVIII.; his tomb remaineth on the north side the choir; Richard Hamney,\r\n1418; Kirnigham, 1468; Sir John Garme; Richard Colsel; Edmond Harbeke,\r\ncurrier; all these were benefactors, and buried there. This church was\r\nsometime a synagogue of the Jews, then a parish church, then a chapel\r\nto St. Olave’s in the Jury, until the 7th of Edward IV., and was then\r\nincorporated a parish church.\r\n\r\nBy the east end of this church is placed a cock of sweet water, taken of\r\nthe main pipe that goeth into Lothberie. Also in London wall, directly\r\nagainst the north end of Coleman street, is a conduit of water, made\r\nat the charges of Thomas Exmew, goldsmith, mayor 1517. And let here\r\nbe the end of this ward, which hath an alderman, his deputy, common\r\ncouncillors four, constables four, scavengers four, of the wardmote\r\ninquest thirteen, and a beadle. It is taxed to the fifteen at £15 16_s._\r\n9_d._[214]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[211] “A well was under the east end of this church, late turned to a\r\npumpe, but decayed.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\n[212] “This may be some argument which I overpasse.”--_1st edition_, p.\r\n223.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBASSINGS HALL WARD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next adjoining to Coleman street, on the west side thereof, is\r\nBassings hall ward, a small thing, and consisteth of one street called\r\nBassings hall street, of Bassings hall, the most principal house whereof\r\nthe ward taketh name. It beginneth in the south by the late spoken\r\nmarket-house called the Bay hall, which is the last house of Coleman\r\nstreet ward. This street runneth from thence north down to London wall,\r\nand some little distance, both east and west, against the said hall; and\r\nthis is the bound of Bassings hall ward.\r\n\r\nMonuments on the east side thereof, amongst divers fair houses for\r\nmerchants, have ye three halls of companies; namely, the Masons’\r\nhall for the first, but of what antiquity that company is I have not\r\nread. The next is the Weavers’ hall, which company hath been of great\r\nantiquity in this city, as appeareth by a charter of Henry II., in these\r\nwords, _Rex omnibus ad quos_, etc., to be Englished thus:--“Henrie,\r\nking of England, duke of Normandie, and of Guian, Earl of Anjou, to\r\nthe bishop, justices, shiriffes, barons, ministers, and all his true\r\nlieges of London, sendeth greeting: Know ye that we have granted to the\r\nweavers in London their guild, with all the freedomes and customes that\r\nthey had in the time of King Henrie my grandfather, so that none but\r\nthey intermit within the citie of their craft but he be of their guild,\r\nneither in Southwark, or other places pertaining to London, otherwise\r\nthan it was done in the time of King Henrie my grandfather; wherefore\r\nI will and straightly commaund that over all lawfully they may treate,\r\nand have all aforesaid, as well in peace, free, worshipfull, and wholy,\r\nas they had it, freer, better, worshipfullier, and wholier, than in\r\nthe time of King Henrie my grandfather, so that they yeeld yearely\r\nto mee two markes of gold at the feast of St. Michaell; and I forbid\r\nthat any man to them do any unright, or disseise, upon paine of ten\r\npound. Witnes, Thomas of Canterburie, Warwicke fili Gar, Chamberlaine\r\nat Winchester.”[215] Also I read, that the same Henry II., in the 31st\r\nof his reign, made a confirmation to the weavers that had a guild or\r\nfraternity in London, wherein it appeareth that the said weavers made\r\nwoollen cloth, and that they had the correction thereof; but amongst\r\nother articles in that patent, it was decreed, that if any man made\r\ncloth of Spanish wool, mixed with English wool, the portgrave, or\r\nprincipal magistrate of London, ought to burn it, etc.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in the year 1197,[216] King Richard I., at the instance of\r\nHubert, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Justicier of England, ordained\r\nthat the woollen cloths in every part of this realm should be in breadth\r\ntwo yards within the lists, and as good in the midst as in the sides,\r\netc. King Henry III. granted that they should not be vexed, for the\r\nburels, or cloth listed, according to the constitution made for breadth\r\nof cloth the 9th of his reign, etc. Richard II., in the 3rd of his\r\nreign, granted an order of agreement between the weavers of London,\r\nEnglishmen, and aliens, or strangers born, brought in by Edward III.\r\n\r\nLower down is the Girdlers’[217] hall, and this is all touching the east\r\nside of this ward.\r\n\r\nOn the west side, almost at the south end thereof, is Bakewell hall,\r\ncorruptly called Blackewall hall: concerning the original whereof I\r\nhave heard divers opinions, which I overpass as fables without colour\r\nof truth; for though the same seemed a building of great antiquity,\r\nyet in mine opinion the foundation thereof was first laid since the\r\nconquest of William, Duke of Normandie; for the same was built upon\r\nvaults of stone, which stone was brought from Caen in Normandie, the\r\nlike of that of Paule’s church, built by Mauritius and his successors,\r\nbishops of London; but that this house hath been a temple or Jewish\r\nsynagogue (as some have fantasied) I allow not, seeing that it had no\r\nsuch form of roundness, or other likeness, neither had it the form of a\r\nchurch, for the assembly of Christians, which are built east and west,\r\nbut contrariwise the same was built north and south, and in form of a\r\nnobleman’s house; and therefore the best opinion in my judgment is,\r\nthat it was of old time belonging to the family of the Bassings, which\r\nwas in this realm a name of great antiquity and renown, and that it\r\nbare also the name of that family, and was called therefore Bassings\r\nhaugh, or hall; whereunto I am the rather induced, for that the arms of\r\nthat family were of old time so abundantly placed in sundry parts of\r\nthat house, even in the stone-work, but more especially on the walls\r\nof the hall, which carried a continual painting of them on every side,\r\nso close together as one escutcheon could be placed by another, which\r\nI myself have often seen and noted before the old building was taken\r\ndown: these arms were a gyronny of twelve points, gold and azure. Of the\r\nBassinges therefore, builders of this house and owners of the ground\r\nnear adjoining, that ward taketh the name, as Coleman street ward of\r\nColeman, and Faringden ward of William and Nicholas Faringden, men that\r\nwere principal owners of those places.\r\n\r\nAnd of old time the most noble persons that inhabited this city were\r\nappointed to be principal magistrates there, as was Godfrey de Magun (or\r\nMagnavile), portgrave, or sheriff, in the reign of William Conqueror,\r\nand of William Rufus; Hugh de Buch, in the reign of Henry I.; Auberie de\r\nVere, Earl of Oxford; after him, Gilbert Becket, in the reign of King\r\nStephen; after that, Godfrey de Magnavile, the son of William, the son\r\nof Godfrey de Magnavile, Earls of Essex, were portgraves or sheriffs of\r\nLondon and Middlesex. In the reign of Henry II., Peter Fitzwalter; after\r\nhim, John Fitznigel, etc.; so likewise in the reign of King John, the\r\n16th of his reign, a time of great troubles, in the year 1214, Salomon\r\nBassing and Hugh Bassing, barons of this realm, as may be supposed, were\r\nsheriffs; and the said Salomon Bassing was mayor in the year 1216,\r\nwhich was the 1st of Henry III. Also Adam Bassing, son to Salomon (as it\r\nseemeth), was one of the sheriffs in the year 1243, the 28th of Henry\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nUnto this Adam de Bassing King Henry III., in the 31st of his reign,\r\ngave and confirmed certain messuages in Aldermanbury, and in Milke\r\nstreet (places not far from Bassinges hall), the advowson of the church\r\nat Bassinges hall, with sundry liberties and privileges.\r\n\r\nThis man was afterwards mayor in the year 1251, the 36th of Henry III.;\r\nmoreover, Thomas Bassing was one of the sheriffs 1269; Robert Bassing,\r\nsheriff, 1279; and William Bassing was sheriff 1308, etc.; for more of\r\nthe Bassings in this city I need not note, only I read of this family\r\nof Bassinges in Cambridgeshire,[218] called Bassing at the bourn, and\r\nmore shortly Bassing bourn, and gave arms, as is afore showed, and was\r\npainted about this old hall. But this family is worn out, and hath left\r\nthe name to the place where they dwelt. Thus much for this Bassings hall.\r\n\r\nNow how Blakewell hall took that name is another question; for which\r\nI read that Thomas Bakewell dwelt in this house in the 36th of Edward\r\nIII.; and that in the 20th of Richard II., the said king, for the sum\r\nof fifty pounds, which the mayor and commonalty had paid into the\r\nhanaper, granted licence so much as was in him to John Frosh, William\r\nParker, and Stephen Spilman (citizens and mercers), that they, the said\r\nmessuage called Bakewell hall, and one garden, with the appurtenances,\r\nin the parish of St. Michael of Bassings haugh, and of St. Laurence\r\nin the Jurie of London, and one messuage, two shops, and one garden,\r\nin the said parish of St. Michael, which they held of the king in\r\nburghage, might give and assign to the mayor and commonalty for ever.\r\nThis Bakewell hall, thus established, hath been long since employed as a\r\nweekly market-place for all sorts of woollen cloths, broad and narrow,\r\nbrought from all parts of this realm, there to be sold. In the 21st of\r\nRichard II., R. Whittington, mayor, and in the 22nd, Drengh Barringtine\r\nbeing mayor, it was decreed that no foreigner or stranger should sell\r\nany woollen cloth but in the Bakewell hall, upon pain of forfeiture\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\nThis house of late years growing ruinous, and in danger of falling,\r\nRichard May, merchant-tailor, at his decease gave towards the new\r\nbuilding of the outward part thereof three hundred pounds, upon\r\ncondition that the same should be performed within three years after\r\nhis decease; whereupon the old Bakewell hall was taken down, and in the\r\nmonth of February next following, the foundation of a new, strong, and\r\nbeautiful storehouse being laid, the work thereof was so diligently\r\napplied, that within the space of ten months after, to the charges of\r\ntwo thousand five hundred pounds, the same was finished in the year 1588.\r\n\r\nNext beyond this house be placed divers fair houses for merchants and\r\nothers, till ye come to the back gate of Guildhall, which gate and part\r\nof the building within the same is of this ward. Some small distance\r\nbeyond this gate the coopers have their common hall. Then is the parish\r\nchurch of St. Michaell, called St. Michaell at Bassings hall, a proper\r\nchurch lately re-edified or new built, whereto John Barton, mercer, and\r\nAgnes his wife, were great benefactors, as appeareth by his mark placed\r\nthroughout the whole roof of the choir and middle aisle of the church:\r\nhe deceased in the year 1460, and was buried in the choir, with this\r\nepitaph:\r\n\r\n    “John Barton lyeth vnder here,\r\n    Sometimes of London, citizen and mercer,\r\n    And Ienet his wife, with their progenie,\r\n    Beene turned to earth as ye may see:\r\n    Friends free what so ye bee,\r\n    Pray for vs we you pray,\r\n    As you see vs in this degree,\r\n    So shall you be another day.”\r\n\r\nFrances Cooke, John Martin, Edward Bromflit, esquire, of Warwickshire,\r\n1460; Richard Barnes, Sir Roger Roe, Roger Velden, 1479; Sir James\r\nYarford, mercer, mayor, deceased 1526, buried under a fair tomb with\r\nhis lady in a special chapel by him built on the north side of the\r\nchoir; Sir John Gresham, mercer, mayor, deceased 1554; Sir John Ailife,\r\nchirurgeon, then a grocer, one of the sheriffs 1548; Nicholas Bakhurst,\r\none of the sheriffs 1577; Wolston Dixi, skinner, mayor, 1585, etc.\r\nThus have you noted one parish church of St. Michaell, Bakewell hall,\r\na market-place for woollen cloths; the Masons’ hall, Weavers’ hall,\r\nCordellers’ hall, and Coopers’ hall. And thus I end this ward, which\r\nhath an alderman, his deputy, for common council four, constables two,\r\nscavengers two, for the wardmote inquest seventeen, and a beadle. It\r\nis taxed to the fifteen in London at seven pounds, and likewise in the\r\nExchequer at seven pounds.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[213] “There is one tomb on the south side the quire, but without\r\ninscription.”--_1st edition_, p. 225.\r\n\r\n[214] “It is taxed to the fifteen in London at nineteen pound, and in\r\nthe Exchequer at nineteen pound”--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n[215] Patent.\r\n\r\n[216] Matthew Paris.\r\n\r\n[217] The Girdlers were incorporated by letters patent of 27th Henry\r\nVI. 6th Aug. 1449, which were confirmed by Elizabeth in 1568, when the\r\npinners and wire-drawers were incorporated with them. Strype says they\r\nseem to have been a fraternity of St. Lawrence, because of the three\r\ngridirons their arms; but those north country readers, who know what a\r\n_girdle iron_ is, will probably agree with me in thinking the gridirons\r\nor girdle irons are borne with reference to the name of the company.\r\n\r\n[218] “Only I read of a branch of this family of Bassinges to have\r\nspread itself into Cambridgeshire, near unto a water or bourne, and was\r\ntherefore, for a difference from other of that name, called Bassing\r\nat the bourn, and more shortly Bassing borne. But this family is also\r\nworne out, and hath left the name to the place where they dwell.”--_1st\r\nedition_, p. 228.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCRIPPLESGATE WARD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next ward is called of Cripplesgate, and consisteth of divers\r\nstreets and lanes, lying as well without the gate and wall of the city\r\nas within: first within the wall, on the east part thereof, towards the\r\nnorth, it runneth to the west side of Bassings hall ward, and towards\r\nthe south it joineth to the ward of Cheape. It beginneth at the west\r\nend of St. Laurence church in the Jurie, on the north side, and runneth\r\nwest to a pump, where sometime was a well with two buckets, at the\r\nsouth corner of Aldermanburie street; which street runneth down north\r\nto Gayspurre lane, and so to London wall, which street and lane are\r\nwholly on both sides of this ward, and so be some few houses on both\r\nthe sides from Gayspurre lane, by and against the wall of the city,\r\neast to the grates made for the water-course of the channels, and west\r\nto Cripplesgate. Now on the south side, from over against the west end\r\nof St. Laurence church to the pump, and then by Milke street south unto\r\nCheape, which Milke street is wholly on both the sides of Cripplegate\r\nward, as also without the south end of Milke street, a part of West\r\nCheape, to wit, from the Standard to the Cross, is all of Cripplegate\r\nward. Then down Great Wood street, which is wholly of this ward on both\r\nthe sides thereof; so is Little Wood street, which runneth down to\r\nCripplegate.\r\n\r\nOut of this Wood street be divers lanes; namely, on the east side is\r\nLad lane, which runneth east to Milke street corner; down lower in Wood\r\nstreet is Love lane, which lieth by the south side of St. Alban’s church\r\nin Wood street, and runneth down to the Conduit in Aldermanburie street.\r\nLower down in Wood street is Addle street, out of the which runneth\r\nPhillip lane down to London wall. These be the lanes on the east side.\r\n\r\nOn the west side of Wood street is Huggen lane, by the south side of St.\r\nMichael’s church, and goeth through to Guthuruns lane. Then lower is\r\nMaiden lane, which runneth west to the north end of Gutherons lane, and\r\nup the said lane on the east side thereof, till against Kery lane, and\r\nback again: then the said Maiden lane, on the north side, goeth up to\r\nStaining lane, and up a part thereof, on the east side, to the farthest\r\nnorth part of Haberdashers’ hall, and back again to Wood street; and\r\nthere lower down to Silver street, which is of this ward, till ye come\r\nto the east end of St. Olave’s church, on the south side, and to Munkes\r\nwell street on the north side; then down the said Munkes well street on\r\nthe east side thereof, and so to Cripplegate, do make the bounds of this\r\nward within the walls.\r\n\r\nWithout Cripplegate, Fore street runneth thwart before the gate, from\r\nagainst the north side of St. Giles church, along to More lane end,\r\nand to a Postern lane end, that runneth betwixt the town ditch on the\r\nsouth, and certain gardens on the north, almost to Moregate; at the\r\neast of which lane is a pot-maker’s house, which house, with all other\r\nthe gardens, houses, and alleys, on that side the Morefields, till ye\r\ncome to a bridge and cow-house near unto Fensburie court, is all of\r\nCripplegate ward; then to turn back again through the said Postern lane\r\nto More lane, which More lane, with all the alleys and buildings there,\r\nis of this ward; after that is Grub street, more than half thereof to\r\nthe straitening of the street; next is Whitecrosse street, up to the end\r\nof Bech lane, and then Redcrosse street wholly, with a part of Golding\r\nlane, even to the posts there placed, as a bounder.\r\n\r\nThen is Bech lane before spoken of, on the east side of the Red Crosse\r\nand the Barbican street, more than half thereof toward Aldersgate\r\nstreet; and so have you all the bounds of Cripplegate ward without the\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nNow for antiquities and ornaments in this ward to be noted: I find\r\nfirst, at the meeting of the corners of the Old Jurie, Milke street,\r\nLad lane, and Aldermanburie, there was of old time a fair well with two\r\nbuckets, of late years converted to a pump. How Aldermanbury street\r\ntook that name many fables have been bruited, all which I overpass as\r\nnot worthy the counting; but to be short, I say, this street took the\r\nname of Alderman’s burie (which is to say a court), there kept in their\r\nbery, or court, but now called the Guildhall; which hall of old time\r\nstood on the east side of the same street, not far from the west end of\r\nGuildhall, now used. Touching the antiquity of this old Alderman’s burie\r\nor court, I have not read other than that Richard Renery, one of the\r\nsheriffs of London in the 1st of Richard I., which was in the year of\r\nChrist 1189, gave to the church of St. Mary at Osney, by Oxford, certain\r\nground and rents in Aldermanbery of London, as appeareth by the register\r\nof that church, as is also entered into the hoistinges of the Guildhall\r\nin London. This old bery court or hall continued, and the courts of the\r\nmayor and aldermen were continually holden there, until the new bery\r\ncourt, or Guildhall that now is, was built and finished; which hall was\r\nfirst begun to be founded in the year 1411, and was not fully finished\r\nin twenty years after. I myself have seen the ruins of the old court\r\nhall in Aldermanbery street, which of late hath been employed as a\r\ncarpenter’s yard, etc.\r\n\r\nIn this Aldermanbery street be divers fair houses on both the sides,\r\nmeet for merchants or men of worship, and in the midst thereof is a fair\r\nconduit, made at the charges of William Eastfield, sometime mayor, who\r\ntook order as well for water to be conveyed from Teyborne, and for the\r\nbuilding of this Conduit, not far distant from his dwelling-house, as\r\nalso for a Standard of sweet water, to be erected in Fleet street, all\r\nwhich was done by his executors, as in another place I have showed.\r\n\r\nThen is the parish church of St. Mary Aldermanbury, a fair church,\r\nwith a churchyard, and cloister adjoining; in the which cloister is\r\nhanged and fastened a shank-bone of a man (as is said), very great,\r\nand larger by three inches and a half than that which hangeth in St.\r\nLawrence church in the Jury, for it is in length twenty-eight inches\r\nand a half of assise, but not so hard and steele-like as the other,\r\nfor the same is light, and somewhat pory and spongy. This bone is said\r\nto be found amongst the bones of men removed from the charnel-house of\r\nPowles, or rather from the cloister of Powles church; of both which\r\nreports I doubt, for that the late Reyne Wolfe, stationer (who paid for\r\nthe carriage of those bones from the charnel to the Morefields), told\r\nme of some thousands of carrie loads and more to be conveyed, whereof\r\nhe wondered, but never told me of any such bone in either place to be\r\nfound; neither would the same have been easily gotten from him if he\r\nhad heard thereof, except he had reserved the like for himself, being\r\nthe greatest preserver of antiquities in those parts for his time.[219]\r\nTrue it is, that this bone (from whence soever it came) being of a man\r\n(as the form showeth), must needs be monstrous, and more than after the\r\nproportion of five shank-bones of any man now living amongst us.\r\n\r\nThere lie buried in this church--Simon Winchcombe, esquire, 1391; Robert\r\nCombarton, 1422; John Wheatley, mercer, 1428; Sir William Estfild,\r\nknight of the bath, mayor 1438, a great benefactor to that church, under\r\na fair monument: he also built their steeple, changed their old bells\r\ninto five tuneable bells, and gave one hundred pounds to other works of\r\nthat church. Moreover, he caused the Conduit in Aldermanbury, which he\r\nhad begun, to be performed at his charges, and water to be conveyed by\r\npipes of lead from Tyborne to Fleet street, as I have said: and also\r\nfrom High Berie to the parish of St. Giles without Cripplegate, where\r\nthe inhabitants of those parts incastellated the same in sufficient\r\ncisterns. John Midleton, mercer, mayor 1472; John Tomes, draper, 1486;\r\nWilliam Bucke, tailor, 1501; Sir William Browne, mayor 1507; Dame\r\nMargaret Jeninges, wife to Stephen Jeninges, mayor 1515; a widow named\r\nStarkey, sometime wife to Modie; Raffe Woodcock, grocer, one of the\r\nsheriffs 1586; Dame Mary Gresham, wife to Sir John Gresham, 1538; Thomas\r\nGodfrey, remembrancer of the office of the first fruits, 1577.\r\n\r\nBeneath this church have ye Gay spur lane, which runneth down to London\r\nwall, as is afore showed. In this lane, at the north end thereof, was\r\nof old time a house of nuns; which house being in great decay, William\r\nElsing, mercer, in the year of Christ 1329, the 3rd of Edward III.,\r\nbegan in place thereof the foundation of an hospital for sustentation\r\nof one hundred blind men; towards the erection whereof he gave his\r\ntwo houses in the parishes of St. Alphage, and our Blessed Lady in\r\nAldermanbury, near Cripplegate.[220] This house was after called a\r\npriory, or hospital, of St. Mary the Virgin, founded in the year 1332 by\r\nW. Elsing, for canons regular; the which William became the first prior\r\nthere. Robert Elsing, son to the said William, gave to the hospital\r\ntwelve pounds by the year, for the finding of three priests: he also\r\ngave one hundred shillings towards the inclosing of the new churchyard\r\nwithout Aldgate, and one hundred shillings to the inclosing of the new\r\nchurchyard without Aldersgate; to Thomas Elsing, his son, eighty pounds,\r\nthe rest of his goods to be sold and given to the poor. This house,\r\nvalued £193 15_s._ 5_d._, was surrendered the eleventh of May, the 22nd\r\nof Henry VIII.\r\n\r\nThe monuments that were in this church defaced:--Thomas Cheney, son to\r\nWilliam Cheney; Thomas, John, and William Cheney; John Northampton,\r\ndraper, mayor 1381; Edmond Hungerford; Henry Frowike; Joan, daughter to\r\nSir William Cheney, wife to William Stoke; Robert Eldarbroke, esquire,\r\n1460; Dame Joan Ratcliffe; William Fowler; William Kingstone; Thomas\r\nSwineley, and Helen his wife, etc. The principal aisle of this church\r\ntowards the north was pulled down, and a frame of four houses set up\r\nin place: the other part, from the steeple upward, was converted into\r\na parish church of St. Alphage; and the parish church which stood\r\nnear unto the wall of the city by Cripplesgate was pulled down, the\r\nplot thereof made a carpenter’s yard, with saw-pits. The hospital\r\nitself, the prior and canons’ house, with other lodgings, were made a\r\ndwelling-house; the churchyard is a garden plot, and a fair gallery on\r\nthe cloister; the lodgings for the poor are translated into stabling for\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1541, Sir John Williams, master of the king’s jewels,\r\ndwelling in this house on Christmas even at night, about seven of the\r\nclock, a great fire began in the gallery thereof, which burned so sore,\r\nthat the flame firing the whole house, and consuming it, was seen all\r\nthe city over, and was hardly quenched, whereby many of the king’s\r\njewels were burnt, and more embezzled (as was said).[221] Sir Rowland\r\nHeyward, mayor, dwelt in this Spittle, and was buried there 1593;\r\nRichard Lee, _alias_ Clarenciaux king of arms, 1597.\r\n\r\nNow to return to Milk street, so called of milk sold there,[222] there\r\nbe many fair houses for wealthy merchants and other; amongst the which\r\nI read, that Gregory Rokesley, chief assay master of the king’s mints,\r\nand mayor of London in the year 1275, dwelt in this Milk street, in a\r\nhouse belonging to the priory of Lewes in Sussex, whereof he was tenant\r\nat will, paying twenty shillings by the year, without[223] other charge:\r\nsuch were the rents of those times.\r\n\r\nIn this Milke street is a small parish church of St. Marie Magdalen,\r\nwhich hath of late years been repaired. William Browne, mayor 1513, gave\r\nto this church forty pounds, and was buried there; Thomas Exmew, mayor\r\n1528, gave forty pounds, and was buried there; so was John Milford, one\r\nof the sheriffs, 1375; John Olney, mayor 1475; Richard Rawson, one of\r\nthe sheriffs 1476; Henry Kelsey; Sir John Browne, mayor 1497; Thomas\r\nMuschampe, one of the sheriffs 1463; Sir William Cantilo, knight,\r\nmercer, 1462; Henry Cantlow, mercer, merchant of the Staple, who built\r\na chapel, and was buried there 1495; John West, alderman, 1517; John\r\nMachell, alderman, 1558; Thomas Skinner, clothworker, mayor 1596.\r\n\r\nThen next is Wood street, by what reason so called I know not. True it\r\nis, that of old time, according to a decree made in the reign of Richard\r\nI., the houses in London were built of stone for defence of fire; which\r\nkind of building was used for two hundred years or more, but of later\r\ntime for the winning of ground taken down, and houses of timber set up\r\nin place. It seemeth therefore that this street hath been of the latter\r\nbuilding, all of timber (for not one house of stone hath been known\r\nthere), and therefore called Wood street; otherwise it might take the\r\nname of some builder or owner thereof.\r\n\r\nThomas Wood, one of the sheriffs in the year 1491, dwelt there; he was\r\nan especial benefactor towards the building of St. Peter’s church at\r\nWood street end; he also built the beautiful front of houses in Cheape\r\nover against Wood street end, which is called Goldsmiths’ row, garnished\r\nwith the likeness of woodmen; his predecessors might be the first\r\nbuilders, owners, and namers of this street after their own name.\r\n\r\nOn the east side of this street is one of the prison houses pertaining\r\nto the sheriffs of London, and is called the Compter in Wood street,\r\nwhich was prepared to be a prison house in the year 1555; and on the eve\r\nof St. Michael the Archangel, the prisoners that lay in the Compter in\r\nBread street were removed to this Compter in Wood street. Beneath this\r\nCompter is Lad lane, or Ladle lane, for so I find it of record in the\r\nparish of St. Michaell Wood street; and beneath that is Love lane, so\r\ncalled of wantons.\r\n\r\nBy this lane is the parish church of St. Alban, which hath the monuments\r\nof Sir Richard Illingworth, baron of the exchequer; Thomas Chatworth,\r\ngrocer, mayor 1443; John Woodcocke, mayor 1405; John Collet, and Alice\r\nhis wife; Ralph Thomas; Ralph and Richard, sons of Ralph Illingworth,\r\nwhich was son to Sir Richard Illingworth, baron of the exchequer;\r\nThomas, son of Sir Thomas Fitzwilliams; Thomas Halton, mercer, mayor\r\n1450; Thomas Ostrich, haberdasher, 1483; Richard Swetenham, esquire; and\r\nWilliam Dunthorne, town-clerk of London, with this epitaph:\r\n\r\n    “_Fœlix prima dies postquam mortalibus ævi\r\n    Cesserit, hic morbus subit, atque repente senectus\r\n    Tum mors, qua nostrum Dunthorn cecidisse Wilelmum.\r\n    Haud cuiquam latuisse reor, dignissimus (inquam),\r\n    Artibus hic Doctor, nec non celeberrimus hujus,\r\n    Clericus Urbis erat, primus, nullique secundus,\r\n    Moribus, ingenio, studio, nil dixeris illi,\r\n    Quin dederit natura boni, pius ipse modestus,\r\n    Longanimus, solers, patiens, super omnia gratus,\r\n    Quique sub immensas curas variosque labores,\r\n    Anxius atteritur vitæ, dum carpserit auras,\r\n    Hoc tetro in tumulo, compostus pace quiescit._”\r\n\r\nSimon Morsted; Thomas Pikehurst, esquire; Richard Take; Robert\r\nAshcombe; Thomas Lovet, esquire, sheriff of Northamptonshire 1491; John\r\nSpare; Katheren, daughter to Sir Thomas Mirley, knight;[224] William\r\nLinchdale, mercer, 1392; John Penie, mercer, 1450; John Thomas, mercer,\r\n1485; Christopher Hawse, mercer, one of the sheriffs 1503; William\r\nSkarborough, vintner; Simon de Berching; Sir John Cheke, knight,\r\nschoolmaster to King Edward VI., deceased 1557; do lie here.\r\n\r\nThen is Adle street, the reason of which name I know not, for at this\r\npresent it is replenished with fair buildings on both sides; amongst\r\nthe which there was sometime the Pinners’ hall, but that company being\r\ndecayed, it is now the Plaisterers’ hall.\r\n\r\nNot far from thence is the Brewers’ hall, a fair house, which company of\r\nBrewers was incorporated by King Henry VI., in the 16th of his reign,\r\nconfirmed by the name of St. Mary and St. Thomas the Martyr, the 19th of\r\nEdward IV.\r\n\r\nFrom the West end of this Adle street, Little Wood street runneth down\r\nto Cripplesgate: and somewhat east from the Sun tavern, against the wall\r\nof the city, is the Curriers’ hall.\r\n\r\nNow, on the west side of Wood street, have ye Huggen lane, so called of\r\none Hugan that of old time dwelt there: he was called Hugan in the lane,\r\nas I have read in the 34th of Edward I. This lane runneth down by the\r\nsouth side of St. Michael’s church in Wood street, and so growing very\r\nnarrow by means of late encroachments to Guthuron’s lane.\r\n\r\nThe parish church of St. Michael in Wood street is a proper thing, and\r\nlately well repaired. John Ive, parson of this church, John Forster,\r\ngoldsmith, and Peter Fikelden, tailor, gave two messuages, and two\r\nshops, with solars, cellars, and other edifices, in the same parish and\r\nstreet, and in Ladle lane, to the reparations of the church, chancel,\r\nand other works of charity, the 16th of Richard II.\r\n\r\nThe monuments here be of William Bambrough, the son of Henry Bambrough\r\nof Skardborough, 1392; William Turner, waxchandler, 1400; John Peke,\r\ngoldsmith, 1441; William Taverner, girdler, 1454; William Mancer,\r\nironmonger, 1465; John Nash, 1466, with an epitaph; John Allen,\r\ntimbermonger, 1441; Robert Draper, 1500; John Lamberde, draper,\r\nalderman, one of the sheriffs of London, who deceased 1554, and was\r\nfather to[225] William Lambarde, esquire, well known by sundry learned\r\nbooks that he hath published; John Medley, chamberlain of London; John\r\nMarsh, esquire, mercer, and common sergeant of London, etc. There is\r\nalso (but without any outward monument) the head of James, the fourth\r\nking of Scots of that name, slain at Flodden field, and buried here by\r\nthis occasion: After the battle the body of the said king being found,\r\nwas enclosed in lead, and conveyed from thence to London, and so to the\r\nmonastery of Shene in Surrey, where it remained for a time, in what\r\norder I am not certain; but since the dissolution of that house, in the\r\nreign of Edward VI., Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk, being lodged, and\r\nkeeping house there, I have been shown the same body so lapped in lead,\r\nclose to the head and body, thrown into a waste room amongst the old\r\ntimber, lead, and other rubble. Since the which time workmen there, for\r\ntheir foolish pleasure, hewed off his head; and Launcelot Young,[226]\r\nmaster glazier to her majesty, feeling a sweet savour to come from\r\nthence, and seeing the same dried from all moisture, and yet the form\r\nremaining, with the hair of the head, and beard red, brought it to\r\nLondon to his house in Wood street, where for a time he kept it for the\r\nsweetness, but in the end caused the sexton of that church to bury it\r\namongst other bones taken out of their charnel, etc.\r\n\r\nI read in divers records of a house in Wood street, then called Black\r\nhall, but no man at this day can tell thereof.\r\n\r\nOn the north side of this St. Michael’s church is Mayden lane, now so\r\ncalled, but of old time Ingene lane, or Ing lane. In this lane the\r\nWaxchandlers have their common hall, on the south side thereof; and\r\nthe Haberdashers have their like hall on the north side, at Stayning\r\nlane end. This company of the Haberdashers, or Hurrers, of old time so\r\ncalled, were incorporated a brotherhood of St. Katherine, the 26th of\r\nHenry VI., and so confirmed by Henry VII., the 17th of his reign, the\r\nCappers and Hat merchants, or Hurrers, being one company of Haberdashers.\r\n\r\nDown lower in Wood street is Silver street (I think of silversmiths\r\ndwelling there), in which be divers fair houses.\r\n\r\nAnd on the north side thereof is Monkeswell street, so called of a well\r\nat the north end thereof, where the Abbot of Garendon had a house, or\r\ncell, called St. James in the wall by Cripplesgate, and certain monks of\r\ntheir house were the chaplains there, wherefore the well (belonging to\r\nthat cell, or hermitage) was called Monks’ well, and the street, of the\r\nwell, Monkswell street.\r\n\r\nThe east side of this street, down against London wall, and the south\r\nside thereof to Cripplesgate, be of Cripplesgate ward, as is afore\r\nshown. In this street, by the corner of Monkswell street, is the\r\nBowyers’ hall. On the east side of Monkswell street be proper alms\r\nhouses, twelve in number founded by Sir Ambrose Nicholas, salter, mayor\r\n1575, wherein be placed twelve poor and aged people rent free, having\r\neach of them seven pence the week, and once the year, each of them five\r\nsacks of charcoal, and one quarter of a hundred fagots, of his gift, for\r\never.\r\n\r\nThen, in Little Wood street be seven proper chambers in an alley on the\r\nwest side, founded for seven poor people therein to dwell rent free, by\r\nHenry Barton, skinner, mayor 1416. Thus much for the monuments of this\r\nward within the walls.\r\n\r\nNow, without the postern of Cripplesgate, first is the parish church\r\nof St. Giles, a very fair and large church, lately repaired, after\r\nthat the same was burnt in the year 1545, the 37th of Henry VIII., by\r\nwhich mischance the monuments of the dead in this church are very few:\r\nnotwithstanding I have read of these following:--Alice, William, and\r\nJohn, wife and sons to T. Clarell; Agnes, daughter to Thomas Niter,\r\ngentleman; William Atwell; Felix, daughter to Sir Thomas Gisors, and\r\nwife to Thomas Travars; Thomas Mason, esquire; Edmond Wartar, esquire;\r\nJoan, wife to John Chamberlaine, esquire, daughter to Roger Lewkner;\r\nWilliam Fryer; John Hamberger, esquire; Hugh Moresbye; Gilbert Prince,\r\nalderman; Oliver Cherley, gentleman; Sir John Wright or Writhesley,\r\n_alias_ Garter king-at-arms; Joan, wife to Thomas Writhesley, Garter,\r\ndaughter and heir to William Hal, esquire; John Writhesley, the younger,\r\nson to Sir John Writhesley and Alianor; Alianor, second wife to John\r\nWrithesley, daughter and heir to Thomas Arnold, sister and heir to\r\nRichard Arnold, esquire; John, her son and heir; Margaret, with her\r\ndaughter; John Brigget; Thomas Ruston, gentleman; John Talbot, esquire,\r\nand Katheren his wife; Thomas Warfle, and Isabel his wife; Thomas\r\nLucie, gentleman, 1447; Ralph Rochford, knight, 1409; Edmond Watar,\r\nesquire; Elizabeth, wife to Richard Barnes, sister and heir to Richard\r\nMalgrave, esquire, of Essex; Richard Gowre, and John Gowre, esquires;\r\nJohn Baronie, of Millain, 1546; Sir Henry Grey, knight, son and heir to\r\nGeorge Grey, Earl of Kent, 1562; Reginald Grey, Earl of Kent; Richard\r\nChoppin, tallowchandler, one of the sheriffs 1530; John Hamber, esquire,\r\n1573; Thomas Hanley, _alias_ Clarenciaux king-at-arms; Thomas Busby,\r\ncooper, who gave the Queen’s Head tavern to the relief of the poor in\r\nthe parish, 1575; John Whelar, goldsmith, 1575; Richard Bolene, 1563;\r\nWilliam Bolene, 1575; W. Bolene, physician, 1587; Robert Crowley, vicar\r\nthere--all these four under one old stone in the choir; the learned John\r\nFoxe, writer of the _Acts and Monuments of the English Church_, 1587;\r\nthe skilful Robert Glover, _alias_ Sommerset herald, 1588.\r\n\r\nThere was in this church of old time a fraternity, or brotherhood, of\r\nOur Blessed Lady, or Corpus Christi, and St. Giles, founded by John\r\nBelancer, in the reign of Edward III., the 35th year of his reign.\r\n\r\nSome small distance from the east end of this church is a water conduit,\r\nbrought in pipes of lead from Highbery, by John Middleton, one of the\r\nexecutors to Sir William Eastfield, and of his goods; the inhabitants\r\nadjoining castellated it of their own cost and charges about the year\r\n1483.\r\n\r\nThere was also a bosse of clear water in the wall of the churchyard,\r\nmade at the charges of Richard Whitington, sometimes mayor, and was like\r\nto that of Bilinsgate: of late the same was turned into an evil pump,\r\nand so is clean decayed.\r\n\r\nThere was also a fair pool of clear water near unto the parsonage, on\r\nthe west side thereof, which was filled up in the reign of Henry VI.,\r\nthe spring was coped in, and arched over with hard stone, and stairs of\r\nstone to go down to the spring on the bank of the town ditch: and this\r\nwas also done of the goods, and by the executors of Richard Whitington.\r\n\r\nIn White Crosse street King Henry V. built one fair house, and founded\r\nthere a brotherhood of St. Giles, to be kept, which house had sometime\r\nbeen an hospital of the French order, by the name of St. Giles\r\nwithout Cripplesgate, in the reign of Edward I., the king having the\r\njurisdiction, and appointing a custos thereof for the precinct of the\r\nparish of St. Giles, etc. patent Richard II., the 15th year; which\r\nhospital being suppressed, the lands were given to the brotherhood for\r\nthe relief of the poor.\r\n\r\nOne alley of divers tenements over against the north wall of St. Giles’\r\nchurchyard, was appointed to be alms houses for the poor, wherein they\r\ndwelt rent free, and otherwise were relieved; but the said brotherhood\r\nwas suppressed by Henry VIII.; since which time Sir John Gresham, mayor,\r\npurchased the lands, and gave part thereof to the maintenance of a free\r\nschool which he had founded at Holt, a market town in Norfolk.\r\n\r\nIn Red Cross street, on the west side from St. Giles’ churchyard up to\r\nthe said cross, be many fair houses built outward, with divers alleys\r\nturning into a large plot of ground, called the Jews’ Garden, as being\r\nthe only place appointed them in England, wherein to bury their dead,\r\ntill the year 1177, the 24th of Henry II., that it was permitted to\r\nthem (after long suit to the king and parliament at Oxford) to have a\r\nspecial place assigned them in every quarter where they dwelt. This\r\nplot of ground remained to the said Jews till the time of their final\r\nbanishment out of England, and is now turned into fair garden plots and\r\nsummer-houses for pleasure.\r\n\r\nOn the east side of this Red Cross street be also divers fair houses,\r\nup to the cross. And there is Beech lane, peradventure so called of\r\nNicholas de la Beech, lieutenant of the Tower of London, put out of that\r\noffice in the 13th of Edward III. This lane stretcheth from the Red\r\nCross street to White Cross street, replenished, not with beech trees,\r\nbut with beautiful houses of stone, brick, and timber. Amongst the which\r\nwas of old time a great house, pertaining to the Abbot of Ramsey, for\r\nhis lodging when he repaired to the city: it is now called Drewry house,\r\nof Sir Drewe Drewrie, a worshipful owner thereof.\r\n\r\nOn the north side of this Beech lane, towards White Cross street, the\r\nDrapers of London have lately built eight alms houses of brick and\r\ntimber, for eight poor widows of their own company, whom they have\r\nplaced there rent free, according to the gift of Lady Askew, widow to\r\nSir Christopher Askew, sometime draper, and mayor 1533.\r\n\r\nThen in Golding lane, Richard Gallard of Islington, esquire, citizen\r\nand painter-stainer of London, founded thirteen alms houses for so many\r\npoor people placed in them rent free; he gave to the poor of the same\r\nalms houses two pence the piece weekly, and a load of charcoal amongst\r\nthem yearly for ever: he left fair lands about Islington to maintain\r\nhis foundation. Thomas Hayes, sometime chamberlain of London, in the\r\nlatter time of Henry VIII., married Elizabeth, his daughter and heir;\r\nwhich Hayes and Elizabeth had a daughter named Elizabeth, married to\r\nJohn Ironmonger, of London, mercer, who now hath the order of the alms\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nOn the west side of the Red Cross is a street, called the Barbican,\r\nbecause sometime there stood, on the north side thereof, a burgh-kenin,\r\nor watch-tower, of the city, called in some language a barbican, as a\r\nbikening is called a beacon; this burgh-kenning, by the name of the\r\nManor of Base court, was given by Edward III. to Robert Ufford, Earl\r\nof Suffolk, and was lately appertaining to Peregrine Bartie, Lord\r\nWilloughby of Ersby.\r\n\r\nNext adjoining to this is one other great house, called Garter house,\r\nsometime built by Sir Thomas Writhe, or Writhesley, knight, _alias_\r\nGarter principal king-of-arms, second son of Sir John Writhe, knight,\r\n_alias_ Garter, and was uncle to the first Thomas, Earl of Southampton,\r\nknight of the Garter, and chancellor of England; he built this house,\r\nand in the top thereof a chapel, which is dedicated by the name of St.\r\nTrinitatis in Alto.\r\n\r\nThus much for that part of Cripplegate ward without the wall, whereof\r\nmore shall be spoken in the suburb of that part. This ward hath an\r\nalderman, and his deputy, within the gate, common council eight,\r\nconstables nine, scavengers twelve, for wardmote inquest fifteen, and\r\na beadle. Without the gate it hath also a deputy, common council two,\r\nconstables four, scavengers four, wardmote inquest seventeen, and a\r\nbeadle. It is taxed in London to the fifteen at forty pound.[227]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[219] “Reyne Wolf, a grave antiquary, collected the great chronicles,\r\nincreased and published by his executors, under the name of Ralph\r\nHolonshead.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\nThe first edition of Holinshed’s _Chronicles of England, Scotland,\r\nand Ireland_, was printed for John Harrison the elder in 1577. From\r\nHolinshed’s dedicatory epistle to Lord Burleigh, it would seem that\r\nReginald Wolfe projected and even executed the greater part of the\r\nwork, it having “pleased God to call him to his mercie after xxv.\r\nyears travail spent therein.” Wolfe, in fact, intended to make these\r\nChronicles the foundation of “_An Universall Cosmographie of the Whole\r\nWorld_.”\r\n\r\n[220] “Obtaining first the king’s licence of mortmain under the great\r\nseal of England.”--_1st edition_, p. 234.\r\n\r\n[221] “The Lord William of Thame was buried in this church, and so was\r\nhis successor in that house, Sir Rowland Heyward.”--_1st edition_, p.\r\n235.\r\n\r\n[222] “As is supposed.”--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n[223] “Without being bounden to reparations or other charge.”--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n[224] “John Collet.”--_1st edition_, p. 257.\r\n\r\n[225] “My loving friend.”--_1st edition_, p. 238.\r\n\r\n[226] “At this present.”--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALDERSGATE WARD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next is Aldersgate ward, taking name of that north gate of the city.\r\nThis ward also consisteth of divers streets and lanes, lying as well\r\nwithin the gate and wall as without. And first to speak of that part\r\nwithin the gate, thus it is.\r\n\r\nThe east part thereof joineth unto the west part of Cripplegate ward\r\nin Engain lane, or Maiden lane. It beginneth on the north side of that\r\nlane, at Stayning lane end, and runneth up from the Haberdashers’ hall\r\nto St. Mary Staining church, and by the church, east, winding almost to\r\nWood street; and west through Oate lane, and then by the south side of\r\nBacon house in Noble street, back again by Lilipot lane, which is also\r\nof that ward, to Maiden lane, and so on that north side west to St. John\r\nZacharies church, and to Foster lane.\r\n\r\nNow on the south side of Engain or Maiden lane is the west side of\r\nGuthuruns lane to Kery lane, and Kery lane itself (which is of this\r\nward), and back again into Engain lane, by the north side of the\r\nGoldsmiths’ hall to Foster lane: and this is the east wing of this ward.\r\nThen is Foster lane almost wholly of this ward, beginneth in the south\r\ntoward Cheap, on the east side by the north side of St. Foster’s church,\r\nand runneth down north-west by the west end of Engain lane, by Lilipot\r\nlane and Oate lane to Noble street, and through that by Shelly house (of\r\nold time so called, as belonging to the Shelleys); Sir Thomas Shelley,\r\nknight, was owner thereof in the 1st of Henry IV. It is now called Bacon\r\nhouse, because the same was new built by Sir Nicholas Bacon, lord keeper\r\nof the great seal. Down on that side, by Sergeant Fleetwood’s house,\r\nrecorder of London, who also new built it, to St. Olave’s church in\r\nSilver street, which is by the north-west end of this Noble street.\r\n\r\nThen again in Foster lane this ward beginneth on the west side thereof,\r\nover against the south-west corner of St. Foster’s church, and runneth\r\ndown by St. Leonard’s church, by Pope lane end, and by St. Ann’s lane\r\nend, which lane is also of this ward, north to the stone wall by the\r\nwall of the city, over against Bacon house, which stone wall, and so\r\ndown north to Cripplegate on that side, is of Faringdon ward.\r\n\r\nThen have ye the main street of this ward, which is called St. Martin’s\r\nlane, including St. Martin, on the east side thereof, and so down on\r\nboth the sides to Aldersgate. And these be the bounds of this ward\r\nwithin the wall and gate.\r\n\r\nWithout the gate the main street called Aldersgate street runneth up\r\nnorth on the east side to the west end of Howndes ditch, or Barbican\r\nstreet; a part of which street is also of this ward. And on the west\r\nside to Long lane, a part whereof is likewise of this ward. Beyond the\r\nwhich Aldersgate street is Goswell street up to the bars.\r\n\r\nAnd on this west side of Aldersgate street, by St. Buttolph’s church\r\nis Briton street, which runneth west to a pump, and then north to the\r\ngate which entereth the churchyard, sometime pertaining to the priory\r\nof St. Bartholomew on the east side; and on the west side towards St.\r\nBartholomew’s Spittle, to a pair of posts there fixed. And these be the\r\nbounds of this Aldersgate ward without.\r\n\r\nThe antiquities be these, first in Stayning lane, of old time so called,\r\nas may be supposed, of painter-stainers dwelling there.\r\n\r\nOn the east side thereof, adjoining to the Haberdashers’ hall, be ten\r\nalms houses, pertaining to the Haberdashers, wherein be placed ten alms\r\npeople of that company, every of them having eight pence the piece every\r\nFriday for ever, by the gift of Thomas Huntlow, haberdasher, one of the\r\nsheriffs in the year 1539. More, Sir George Baron gave them ten pounds\r\nby the year for ever.\r\n\r\nThen is the small parish church of St. Mary, called Stayning, because it\r\nstandeth at the north end of Stayning lane. In the which church, being\r\nbut newly built, there remains no monument worth the noting.\r\n\r\nThen is Engain lane, or Mayden lane, and at the north-west corner\r\nthereof the parish church of St. John Zachary; a fair church, with the\r\nmonuments well preserved, of Thomas Lichfield, who founded a chantry\r\nthere in the 14th of Edward II.; of Sir Nicholas Twiford, goldsmith,\r\nmayor 1388, and Dame Margery his wife, of whose goods the church was\r\nmade and new built, with a tomb for them, and others of their race,\r\n1390; Drugo Barentine, mayor 1398; he gave fair lands to the Goldsmiths;\r\nhe dwelt right against the Goldsmiths’ hall; between the which hall and\r\nhis dwelling house he built a gallery thwarting the street, whereby\r\nhe might go from one to the other; he was buried in this church, and\r\nChristian his wife, 1427; John Adis, goldsmith, 1400, and Margaret his\r\nwife; John Francis, goldsmith, mayor 1400, and Elizabeth his wife,\r\n1450; I. Sutton, goldsmith, one of the sheriffs 1413; Bartholomew\r\nSeman, goldbeater, master of the king’s mints within the Tower of\r\nLondon and the town of Calice, 1430;[228], John Hewet, esquire, 1500;\r\nWilliam Breakespere, goldsmith, 1461; Christopher Eliot, goldsmith,\r\n1505; Bartholomew Reade, goldsmith, mayor 1502, was buried in the\r\nCharterhouse, and gave to this, his parish church, one hundred pounds;\r\nhis wife was buried here with a fair monument, her picture in habit of a\r\nwidow; Thomas Keyton Lorimar, 1522; William Potken, esquire, 1537; John\r\nCornish, with an epitaph, 1470; Robert Fenruther, goldsmith, one of the\r\nsheriffs in the year 1512.\r\n\r\nOn the east side of this Foster lane, at Engain lane end, is the\r\nGoldsmiths’ hall, a proper house, but not large; and, therefore, to say\r\nthat Bartholomew Read, goldsmith, mayor in the year 1502, kept such a\r\nfeast in this hall, as some have fabuled,[229] is far incredible, and\r\naltogether impossible, considering the smallness of the hall, and number\r\nof the guests, which, as they say, were more than a hundred persons of\r\ngreat estate. For the messes and dishes of meats to them served, the\r\npaled park in the same hall furnished with fruitful trees, beasts of\r\nvenery, and other circumstances of that pretended feast, well weighed,\r\nWestminster hall would hardly have sufficed; and, therefore, I will\r\noverpass it, and note somewhat of principal goldsmiths.\r\n\r\nFirst I read, that Leofstane, goldsmith, was provost of this city in\r\nthe reign of Henry I. Also, that Henry Fitz Alewin Fitz Leafstane,\r\ngoldsmith, was mayor of London in the 1st of Richard I., and continued\r\nmayor twenty-four years. Also that Gregory Rocksly, chief say-master of\r\nall the king’s mints within England, (and therefore by my conjecture)\r\na goldsmith, was mayor in the 3rd of Edward I., and continued mayor\r\nseven years together. Then, William Faringdon, goldsmith, alderman of\r\nFaringdon ward, one of the sheriffs 1281, the 9th of Edward I., who was\r\na goldsmith, as appeareth in record, as shall be shown in Faringdon\r\nward. Then Nicholas Faringdon his son, goldsmith, alderman of Faringdon\r\nward, four times mayor in the reign of Edward II., etc. For the rest\r\nof latter time are more manifestly known, and therefore I leave them.\r\nThe men of this mystery were incorporated or confirmed in the 16th of\r\nRichard II.\r\n\r\nThen at the north end of Noble street is the parish church of St. Olave\r\nin Silver street, a small thing, and without any noteworthy monuments.\r\n\r\nOn the west side of Foster lane is the small parish church of St.\r\nLeonard’s, for them of St. Martin’s le Grand. A number of tenements\r\nbeing lately built in place of the great collegiate church of St.\r\nMartin, that parish is mightily increased. In this church remain these\r\nmonuments. First, without the church is graven in stone on the east end,\r\nJohn Brokeitwell, an especial re-edifier, or new builder thereof. In\r\nthe choir, graven in brass, Robert Purfet, grocer, 1507; Robert Trapis,\r\ngoldsmith, 1526, with this epitaph:--\r\n\r\n    “When the bels be merily roong,\r\n    And the masse devoutly sung,\r\n    And the meat merily eaten,\r\n    Then shall Robert Trips, his wives\r\n    And children be forgotten.”\r\n\r\nThen in Pope lane, so called of one Pope that was owner thereof, on\r\nthe north side of the parish church of St. Anne in the Willows, so\r\ncalled, I know not upon what occasion, but some say of willows growing\r\nthereabouts; but now there is no such void place for willows to grow,\r\nmore than the churchyard, wherein do grow some high ash trees.\r\n\r\nThis church, by casualty of fire in the year 1548, was burnt, so far as\r\nit was combustible, but since being newly repaired, there remain a few\r\nmonuments of antiquity: of Thomas Beckhenton, clerk of the pipe, was\r\nburied there 1499; Raph Caldwell, gentleman, of Grays inn, 1527; John\r\nLord Sheffelde; John Herenden, mercer, esquire, 1572, these verses on an\r\nold stone:--[230]\r\n\r\n    _Qu   an     Tris  di  c  vul    stra\r\n       os   guis     ti  ro um   nere    uit\r\n      h  san    Chris  mi  T   mu      la_\r\n\r\nWilliam Gregory, skinner, mayor of London in the year 1451, was there\r\nburied, and founded a chantry, but no monument of him remaineth.\r\n\r\nThen in St. Martin’s lane was of old time a fair and large college of\r\na dean and secular canons or priests, and was called St. Martin’s le\r\nGrand, founded by Ingelricus and Edwardus his brother, in the year\r\nof Christ 1056, and confirmed by William the Conqueror, as appeareth\r\nby his charter dated 1068. This college claimed great privileges of\r\nsanctuary and otherwise, as appeareth in a book, written by a notary of\r\nthat house about the year 1442, the 19th of Henry VI., wherein, amongst\r\nother things, is set down and declared, that on the 1st of September,\r\nin the year aforesaid, a soldier, prisoner in Newgate, as he was led by\r\nan officer towards the Guildhall of London, there came out of Panyer\r\nalley five of his fellowship, and took him from the officer, brought\r\nhim into sanctuary at the west door of St. Martin’s church, and took\r\ngrithe of that place; but the same day Philip Malpas and Rob. Marshall,\r\nthen sheriffs of London, with many other, entered the said church, and\r\nforcibly took out with them the said five men thither fled, led them\r\nfettered to the Compter, and from thence, chained by the necks, to\r\nNewgate; of which violent taking the dean and chapter in large manner\r\ncomplained to the king, and required him, as their patron, to defend\r\ntheir privileges, like as his predecessors had done, etc. All which\r\ncomplaint and suit the citizens by their counsel, Markam, sergeant at\r\nthe law, John Carpenter, late common clerk of the city, and other,\r\nlearnedly answered, offering to prove that the said place of St. Martin\r\nhad no such immunity or liberty as was pretended; namely, Carpenter\r\noffered to lose his livelihood, if that church had more immunity than\r\nthe least church in London. Notwithstanding, after long debating of\r\nthis controversy, by the king’s commandment, and assent of his council\r\nin the starred chamber, the chancellor and treasurer sent a writ unto\r\nthe sheriffs of London, charging them to bring the said five persons\r\nwith the cause of their taking and withholding afore the king in his\r\nChancery, on the vigil of Allhallows. On which day the said sheriffs,\r\nwith the recorder and counsel of the city, brought and delivered them\r\naccordingly, afore the said lords; whereas the chancellor, after he had\r\ndeclared the king’s commandment, sent them to St. Martin’s, there to\r\nabide freely, as in a place having franchises, whiles them liked, etc.\r\n\r\nThus much out of that book have I noted concerning the privilege of that\r\nplace challenged in these days, since the which time, to wit, in the\r\nyear 1457, the 36th of the said Henry VI., an ordinance was made by the\r\nking and his council concerning the said sanctuary men in St. Martin’s\r\nle Grand, whereof the articles are set down in the book of K., within\r\nthe chamber of the Guildhall, in the lease 299.\r\n\r\nThis college was surrendered to King Edward VI., the 2nd of his reign,\r\nin the year of Christ 1548; and the same year the college church being\r\npulled down, in the east part thereof a large wine tavern was built,\r\nand with all down to the west, and throughout the whole precinct of\r\nthat college, many other houses were built and highly prized, letten to\r\nstrangers born, and other such, as there claimed benefit of privileges\r\ngranted to the canons serving God day and night (for so be the words in\r\nthe charter of William the Conqueror), which may hardly be wrested to\r\nartificers, buyers and sellers, otherwise than is mentioned in the 21st\r\nof St. Matthew’s Gospel.\r\n\r\nLower down on the west side of St. Martin’s lane, in the parish of\r\nSt. Anne, almost by Aldersgate, is one great house, commonly called\r\nNorthumberland house; it belonged to H. Percy. King Henry IV., in\r\nthe 7th of his reign, gave this house, with the tenements thereunto\r\nappertaining, to Queen Jane his wife, and then it was called her\r\nWardrobe: it is now a printing house.\r\n\r\nWithout Aldersgate, on the east side of Aldersgate street, is the Cooks’\r\nhall; which Cooks (or Pastelars) were admitted to be a company, and to\r\nhave a master and wardens, in the 22nd of Edward IV. From thence along\r\ninto Houndsditch, or Barbican street, be many fair houses. On the west\r\nside also be the like fair buildings till ye come to Long lane, and so\r\nto Goswell street.\r\n\r\nIn Briton street, which took that name of the dukes of Brittany lodging\r\nthere, is one proper parish church of St. Buttolph, in which church was\r\nsometime a brotherhood of St. Fabian and Sebastian, founded in the year\r\n1377, the 51st of Edward III., and confirmed by Henry IV., in the 6th\r\nof his reign. Then Henry VI., in the 24th of his reign, to the honour\r\nof the Trinity, gave license to Dame Joan Astley, sometime his nurse,\r\nto R. Cawod and T. Smith, to found the same a fraternity, perpetually\r\nto have a master and two custoses, with brethren and sisters, etc. This\r\nbrotherhood was endowed with lands more than thirty pounds by the year,\r\nand was suppressed by Edward VI. There lie buried, John de Bath, weaver,\r\n1390; Philip at Vine, capper, 1396; Benet Gerard, brewer, 1403; Thomas\r\nBilsington founded a chantry there, and gave to that church a house,\r\ncalled the Helmet upon Cornhill; John Bradmore, chirurgeon, Margaret and\r\nKatheren his wives, 1411; John Michaell, sergeant-at-arms, 1415; Allen\r\nBret, carpenter, 1425; Robert Malton, 1426; John Trigilion, brewer,\r\n1417; John Mason, brewer, 1431; Rob. Cawood, clerk of the pipe in the\r\nking’s exchequer, 1466; Ri. Emmessey; John Walpole; I. Hartshorne,\r\nesquire, servant to the king, 1400, and other of that family, great\r\nbenefactors to that church; W. Marrow, grocer, mayor, and Katherine his\r\nwife, were buried there about 1468. The Lady Ann Packington, widow, late\r\nwife to Jo. Packinton, knight, chirographer of the court of the common\r\npleas; she founded alms houses near unto the White Fryers’ church in\r\nFleet street: the Clothworkers in London have oversight thereof.\r\n\r\nAnd thus an end of this ward; which hath an alderman, his deputy, common\r\ncouncillors five, constables eight, scavengers nine, for the wardmote\r\ninquest fourteen, and a beadle. It is taxed to the fifteen in London\r\nseven pounds, and[231] in the exchequer six pounds nineteen shillings.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[227] “It is taxed in London to the fifteene at forty pound, and in the\r\nExchequer at thirty-nine pound ten shillings.”--_1st edition_, p. 242.\r\n\r\n[228] “Thomas Leichfield.”--_1st edition_, p. 244.\r\n\r\n[229] R. Grafton.\r\n\r\n[230] These disjointed syllables, it will be seen, may be so read as to\r\nform the following rhyming couplet:--\r\n\r\n    “_Quos anguis tristi diro cum vulnere stravit,\r\n    Hos sanguis Christi miro tum munere lavit._”\r\n\r\n\r\n[231] “Likewise in the exchequer.”--_1st edition_, p. 247.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFARINGDON WARD INFRA, OR WITHIN\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the south side of Aldersgate ward lieth Faringdon ward, called\r\n_infra_ or within, for a difference from another ward of that name,\r\nwhich lieth without the walls of the city, and is therefore called\r\nFaringdon _extra_. These two wards of old time were but one, and had\r\nalso but one alderman, till the 17th of Richard II., at which time the\r\nsaid ward, for the greatness thereof, was divided into twain, and by\r\nparliament ordered to have two aldermen, and so it continueth till this\r\nday. The whole great ward of Farindon, both _infra_ and _extra_, took\r\nname of W. Farindon, goldsmith, alderman of that ward, and one of the\r\nsheriffs of London in the year 1281, the 9th of Edward I. He purchased\r\nthe Aldermanry of this ward, as by the abstract of deeds, which I have\r\nread thereof, may appear.\r\n\r\n“Thomas de Arderne, son and heir to Sir Ralph Arderne, knight, granted\r\nto Ralph le Feure, citizen of London, one of the sheriffs in the year\r\n1277, all the aldermanry, with the appurtenances within the city of\r\nLondon, and the suburbs of the same between Ludgate and Newgate, and\r\nalso without the same gates: which aldermanry, Ankerinus de Averne\r\nheld during his life, by the grant of the said Thomas de Arderna, to\r\nhave and to hold to the said Ralph, and to his heirs, freely without\r\nall challenge, yielding therefore yearly to the said Thomas and his\r\nheirs one clove[232] or slip of gilliflowers, at the feast of Easter,\r\nfor all secular service and customs, with warranty unto the said Ralph\r\nle Fevre and his heirs, against all people, Christians and Jews, in\r\nconsideration of twenty marks, which the said Ralph le Fevre did give\r\nbeforehand, in name of a gersum[233] or fine, to the said Thomas, etc.,\r\ndated the 5th of Edward I. Witness, G. de Rokesley, maior; R. Arrar,\r\none of the shiriffes; H. Wales, P. le Taylor, T. de Basing, I. Horne,\r\nN. Blackthorn, aldermen of London.” After this, John le Fevre, son and\r\nheir to the said Ralph le Fevre, granted to William Farindon, citizen\r\nand goldsmith of London, and to his heirs, the said aldermanry, with the\r\nappurtenances, for the service thereunto belonging, in the 7th of Edward\r\nI., in the year of Christ 1279. This aldermanry descended to Nicholas\r\nFarindon, son to the said William, and to his heirs; which Nicholas\r\nFarindon, also a goldsmith, was four times mayor, and lived many years\r\nafter; for I have read divers deeds, whereunto he was a witness, dated\r\nthe year 1360: he made his testament 1361, which was fifty-three years\r\nafter his first being mayor, and was buried in St. Peter’s church in\r\nCheape. So this ward continued under the government of William Faringdon\r\nthe father, and Nicholas his son, by the space of eighty-two years, and\r\nretaineth their name until this present day.\r\n\r\nThis ward of Faringdon within the walls is bounded thus: Beginning in\r\nthe east, at the great cross in Westcheape, from whence it runneth west.\r\nOn the north side from the parish church of St. Peter, which is at the\r\nsouth-west corner of Wood street, on to Guthurun’s lane, and down that\r\nlane to Hugon lane on the east side, and to Kery lane on the west.\r\n\r\nThen again into Cheape and to Foster lane, and down that lane on the\r\neast side, to the north side of St. Foster’s church, and on the west,\r\ntill over against the south-west corner of the said church, from whence\r\ndown Foster lane and Noble street is all of Aldersgate street ward,\r\ntill ye come to the stone wall, in the west side of Noble street, as is\r\nafore showed. Which said wall, down to Nevil’s inn or Windsor house,\r\nand down Monkes well street, on that west side, then by London wall to\r\nCripplegate, and the west side of that same gate is all of Faringdon\r\nward.\r\n\r\nThen back again into Cheape, and from Foster lane end to St. Martin’s\r\nlane end, and from thence through St. Nicholas shambles, by Penticost\r\nlane and Butchers’ alley, and by Stinking lane through Newgate market to\r\nNewgate; all which is the north side of Faringdon ward.\r\n\r\nOn the south, from against the said great cross in Cheape west to\r\nFridayes street, and down that street on the east side, till over\r\nagainst the north-east corner of St. Mathew’s church; and on the west\r\nside, till the south corner of the said church.\r\n\r\nThen again along Cheape to the old Exchange, and down that lane (on the\r\neast side) to the parish church of St. Augustine, which church, and one\r\nhouse next adjoining in Watheling street, be of this ward, and on the\r\nwest side of this lane, to the east arch or gate by St. Augustine’s\r\nchurch, which entereth the south churchyard of St. Paules, which arch\r\nor gate was built by Nicholas Faringdon about the year 1361, and within\r\nthat gate, on the said north side, to the gate that entereth the north\r\nchurchyard, and all the north churchyard is of this Faringdon ward.\r\n\r\nThen again into Cheape, and from the north end of the Old Exchange, west\r\nby the north gate of Paules churchyard, by Pater noster row, by the two\r\nlanes out of Paules church, and to a sign of the Golden Lion, which is\r\nsome twelve houses short of Ave Mary lane; the west side of which lane\r\nis of this ward.\r\n\r\nThen at the south end of Ave Mary lane is Creed lane; the west side\r\nwhereof is also of this ward.\r\n\r\nNow betwixt the south end of Ave Mary lane and the north end of Creede\r\nlane, is the coming out of Paules churchyard on the east, and the high\r\nstreet called Bowier row to Ludgate on the west, which way to Ludgate is\r\nof this ward. On the north side whereof is St. Martin’s church, and on\r\nthe south side a turning into the Blacke friars.\r\n\r\nNow to turn up again to the north end of Ave Mary lane, there is a short\r\nlane which runneth west some small distance, and is there closed up with\r\na gate into a great house: and this is called Amen lane.\r\n\r\nThen on the north side of Pater noster row, beginning at the Conduit\r\nover against the Old Exchange lane end, and going west by St. Michael’s\r\nchurch; at the west end of which church is a small passage through\r\ntowards the north: and beyond this church some small distance is another\r\npassage, which is called Paniar alley, and cometh out against St.\r\nMartin’s lane end.\r\n\r\nThen further west in Pater noster row is Ivie lane, which runneth north\r\nto the west end of St. Nicholas shambles; and then west Pater noster\r\nrow, till over against the Golden Lion, where the ward endeth for that\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nThen about some dozen houses (which is of Baynard’s castle ward) to\r\nWarwick lane end; which Warwick lane stretcheth north to the high\r\nstreet of Newgate market. And the west side of Warwick lane is of this\r\nFaringdon ward; for the east side of Warwick lane, of Ave Marie lane,\r\nand of Creede lane, with the west end of Pater noster row, are all of\r\nBaynardes castle ward.\r\n\r\nYet to begin again at the said Conduit by the Old Exchange, on the\r\nnorth side thereof is a large street that runneth up to Newgate, as is\r\naforesaid. The first part, or south side whereof, from the Conduit to\r\nthe shambles, is called Bladder street. Then on the back side of the\r\nshambles be divers slaughter-houses, and such like, pertaining to the\r\nshambles; and this is called Mount Godard street. Then is the shambles\r\nitself, and then Newgate market; and so the whole street, on both sides\r\nup to Newgate, is of this ward; and thus it is wholly bounded.\r\n\r\nMonuments in this ward be these: First, the great cross in Westcheape\r\nstreet, but in the ward of Faringdon; the which cross was first erected\r\nin that place by Edward I., as before is showed in Westcheape street.\r\n\r\nAt the south-west corner of Wood street is the parish church of St.\r\nPeter the Apostle by the said cross, a proper church lately new built.\r\nJohn Sha, goldsmith, mayor, deceased 1508, appointed by his testament\r\nthe said church and steeple to be newly built of his goods, with a flat\r\nroof; notwithstanding, Thomas Wood, goldsmith, one of the sheriffs\r\n1491, is accounted principal benefactor, because the roof of the middle\r\naisle is supported by images of woodmen. I find to have been buried\r\nin this church--Nicholas Farendon, mayor; Richard Hadley, grocer,\r\n1592; John Palmer, fishmonger, 1500; William Rus, goldsmith, sheriff\r\n1429; T. Atkins, esquire, 1400; John Butler, sheriff 1420;[234] Henry\r\nWarley, alderman 1524; Sir John Monday, goldsmith, mayor, deceased\r\n1537; Augustine Hinde, cloth-worker, one of the sheriffs in the year\r\n1550, whose monument doth yet remain, the others be gone; Sir Alexander\r\nAuenon, mayor 1570.\r\n\r\nThe long shop, or shed, incroaching on the high street before this\r\nchurch wall was licensed to be made in the year 1401, yielding to the\r\nchamber of London thirty shillings and four pence yearly for the time,\r\nbut since thirteen shillings and four pence. Also the same shop was\r\nletten by the parish for three pounds at the most many years since.\r\n\r\nThen is Guthurun’s lane, so called of Guthurun, sometime owner thereof.\r\nThe inhabitants of this lane of old time were goldbeaters, as doth\r\nappear by records in the Exchequer; for the Easterling money was\r\nappointed to be made of fine silver, such as men made into foil, and was\r\ncommonly called silver of Guthurun’s lane, etc. The Embroiderers’ hall\r\nis in this lane. John Throwstone, embroiderer, then goldsmith, sheriff,\r\ndeceased 1519, gave forty pounds towards the purchase of this hall.\r\nHugon lane on the east side, and Kery lane (called of one Kery) on the\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nThen in the high street on the same north side is the Saddlers’ hall,\r\nand then Fauster lane (so called) of St. Fauster’s, a fair church lately\r\nnew built. Henry Coote, goldsmith, one of the sheriffs, deceased 1509,\r\nbuilt St. Dunston’s chapel there. John Throwstone, one of the sheriffs,\r\ngave to the building thereof one hundred pounds by his testament.\r\nJohn Browne, sergeant painter, alderman, deceased 1532, was a great\r\nbenefactor, and was there buried. William Trist, cellarer to the king,\r\n1425, John Standelfe,[235] goldsmiths, lie buried there; Richard\r\nGalder, 1544; Agnes, wife to William Milborne, chamberlain of London,\r\n1500, etc.\r\n\r\nThen down Foster lane and Noble street, both of Aldersgate street ward,\r\ntill ye come to the stone wall which incloseth a garden plot before\r\nthe wall of the city, on the west side of Noble street, and is of\r\nthis Faringdon ward. This garden-plot, containing ninety-five ells in\r\nlength, nine ells and a half in breadth, was by Adam de Burie, mayor,\r\nthe alderman, and citizens of London, letten to John de Nevill, Lord of\r\nRaby, Radulph and Thomas his sons, for sixty years, paying 6_s._ 8_d._\r\nthe year, dated the 48th of Edward III., having in a seal pendant on\r\nthe one side, the figure of a walled city and of St. Paul, a sword in\r\nhis right hand, and in the left a banner; three leopards about that\r\nseal, on the same side, written, _Sigillum Baronium Londoniarum_. On the\r\nother side, the like figure of a city, a bishop sitting on an arch; the\r\ninscription, _Me : que : te : peperi : ne : Cesses : Thoma : tueri_.\r\nThus much for the barons of London, their common seal at that time. At\r\nthe north end of this garden-plot is one great house built of stone and\r\ntimber, now called the Lord Windsor’s house, of old time belonging to\r\nthe Nevils; as in the 19th of Richard II. it was found by inquisition\r\nof a jury, that Elizabeth Nevil died, seised of a great messuage in the\r\nparish of St. Olave, in Monk’s well street in London, holden of the\r\nking in free burgage, which she held of the gift of John Nevell of Raby\r\nher husband, and that John Latimer was next son and heir to the said\r\nElizabeth.\r\n\r\nIn this west side is the Barbers-Chirurgeons’ hall. This company was\r\nincorporated by means of Thomas Morestede, esquire, one of the sheriffs\r\nof London 1436, chirurgeon to the kings of England, Henry IV., V., and\r\nVI.: he deceased 1450. Then Jaques Fries, physician to Edward IV.,\r\nand William Hobbs, physician and chirurgeon for the same king’s body,\r\ncontinuing the suit the full time of twenty years, Edward IV., in the\r\n2nd of his reign, and Richard, Duke of Gloucester, became founders of\r\nthe same corporation in the name of St. Cosme and St. Damiane. The first\r\nassembly of that craft was Roger Strippe, W. Hobbs, T. Goddard, and\r\nRichard Kent; since the which time they built their hall in that street,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nAt the north corner of this street, on the same side, was sometime an\r\nhermitage, or chapel of St. James, called in the wall, near Cripplegate:\r\nit belonged to the abbey and convent of Garadon, as appeareth by a\r\nrecord, the 27th of Edward I., and also the 16th of Edward III. William\r\nde Lions was hermit there, and the abbot and convent of Geredon found\r\ntwo chaplains, Cistercian monks of their house, in this hermitage; one\r\nof them for Aymor de Valence, Earl of Pembroke, and Mary de Saint Paule,\r\nhis countess.\r\n\r\nOf these monks, and of a well pertaining to them, the street took\r\nthat name, and is called Monks’ well street. This hermitage, with the\r\nappurtenances, was in the reign of Edward VI. purchased from the said\r\nking by William Lambe, one of the gentlemen of the king’s chapel,\r\ncitizen and cloth-worker of London: he deceased in the year 1577, and\r\nthen gave it to the clothworkers of London, with other tenements, to the\r\nvalue of fifty pounds the year, to the intent they shall hire a minister\r\nto say divine service there, etc.\r\n\r\nAgain to the high street of Cheape, from Fauster lane end to St.\r\nMartin’s, and by that lane to the shambles or flesh-market, on the north\r\nside whereof is Penticost lane, containing divers slaughter-houses for\r\nthe butchers.\r\n\r\nThen was there of old time a proper parish church of St. Nicholas,\r\nwhereof the said flesh-market took the name, and was called St.\r\nNicholas’ shambles. This church, with the tenements and ornaments, was\r\nby Henry VIII. given to the mayor and commonalty of the city, towards\r\nthe maintenance of the new parish church then to be erected in the late\r\ndissolved church of the Grey Friars; so was this church dissolved and\r\npulled down. In place whereof, and of the churchyard, many fair houses\r\nare now built in a court with a well, in the midst whereof the church\r\nstood.\r\n\r\nThen is Stinking lane, so called, or Chick lane, at the east end of the\r\nGrey Friars church, and there is the Butchers’ hall.\r\n\r\nIn the 3rd of Richard II. motion was made that no butcher should kill\r\nno flesh within London, but at Knightsbridge, or such like distance of\r\nplace from the walls of the city.\r\n\r\nThen the late dissolved church of the Grey Friars; the original whereof\r\nwas this:\r\n\r\nThe first of this order of friars in England, nine in number, arrived\r\nat Dover; five of them remained at Canterburie, the other four came to\r\nLondon, were lodged at the preaching friars in Oldborne for the space of\r\nfifteen days, and then they hired a house in Cornhill of John Trevers,\r\none of the sheriffs of London. They built there little cells, wherein\r\nthey inhabited; but shortly after, the devotion of citizens towards\r\nthem, and the number of the friars so increased, that they were by the\r\ncitizens removed to a place in St. Nicholas’ shambles; which John Ewin,\r\nmercer, appropriated unto the commonalty, to the use of the said friars,\r\nand himself became a lay brother amongst them. About the year 1225,\r\nWilliam Joyner built their choir, Henry Walles the body of the church,\r\nWalter Potter, alderman, the chapter house, Gregorie Rokesley their\r\ndorter; Bartholomew of the Castle made the refectory, Peter de Heliland\r\nmade the infirmitory, Bevis Bond, king of heralds, made the study, etc.\r\n\r\nMargaret, queen, second wife to Edward I., began the choir of their\r\nnew church in the year 1306; to the building whereof, in her lifetime,\r\nshe gave two thousand marks, and one hundred marks by her testament.\r\nJohn Britaine, Earl of Richmond, built the body of the church to the\r\ncharges of three hundred pounds, and gave many rich jewels and ornaments\r\nto be used in the same; Marie, Countess of Pembroke, seventy pounds.\r\nGilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, bestowed twenty great beams out of\r\nhis forest of Tunbridge, and twenty pounds sterling. Lady Helianor le\r\nSpencer, Lady Elizabeth de Burgh, sister to Gilbert de Clare, gave sums\r\nof money; and so did divers citizens; as Arnald de Tolinea, one hundred\r\npounds; Robert, Baron Lisle, who became a friar there, three hundred\r\npounds; Bartholomew de Almaine, fifty pounds. Also Philippa, queen,\r\nwife to Edward III., gave sixty-two pounds; Isabell, queen, mother to\r\nEdward III., gave threescore and ten pounds. And so the work was done\r\nwithin the space of twenty-one years, 1337. This church was furnished\r\nwith windows made at the charges of divers persons. The Lady Margaret\r\nSegrave, Countess of Norfolk, bare the charges of making the stalls in\r\nthe choir, to the value of three hundred and fifty marks, about the\r\nyear 1380. Richard Whittington, in the year 1429, founded the library,\r\nwhich was in length one hundred and twenty-nine feet, and in breadth\r\nthirty-one, all sealed with wainscot, having twenty-eight desks and\r\neight double settles of wainscot; which in the next year following was\r\naltogether finished in building, and within three years after furnished\r\nwith books, to the charges of five hundred and fifty-six pounds ten\r\nshillings; whereof Richard Whittington bare four hundred pounds; the\r\nrest was borne by Doctor Thomas Winchelsey, a friar there; and for\r\nthe writing out of D. Nicholas de Lira, his works, in two volumes, to\r\nbe chained there, one hundred marks, etc. The ceiling of the choir at\r\ndivers men’s charges, two hundred marks, and the painting at fifty\r\nmarks; their conduit head and water-course given them by William Tailor,\r\ntailor to Henry III., etc.\r\n\r\nThis whole church containeth in length three hundred feet, of the feet\r\nof St. Paule; in breadth eighty-nine feet, and in height from the ground\r\nto the roof sixty-four feet and two inches, etc. It was consecrated\r\n1325, and at the general suppression was valued at thirty-two pounds\r\nnineteen shillings, surrendered the 12th of November 1538, the 30th of\r\nHenry VIII., the ornaments and goods being taken to the king’s use. The\r\nchurch was shut up for a time, and used as a storehouse for goods taken\r\nprizes from the French; but in the year 1546, on the 3rd of January, was\r\nagain set open. On the which day preached at Paule’s cross the Bishop of\r\nRochester, where he declared the king’s gift thereof to the city for the\r\nrelieving of the poor. Which gift was by patent--of St. Bartholomew’s\r\nSpittle, lately valued at three hundred and five pounds six shillings\r\nand seven pence, and surrendered to the king; of the said church of\r\nthe Grey Friars, and of two parish churches, the one of St. Nicholas\r\nin the shambles, and the other of St. Ewines in Newgate market, which\r\nwere to be made one parish church in the said Friars church; and in\r\nlands he gave for maintenance for the said church, with divine service,\r\nreparations, etc., five hundred marks by year for ever.\r\n\r\nThe 13th of January, the 38th of Henry VIII., an agreement was made\r\nbetwixt the king and the mayor[236] and commonalty of London, dated the\r\n27th of December, by which the said gift of the Grey Friars church, with\r\nall the edifices and ground, the fratry, the library, the dortor, and\r\nchapter-house, the great cloister and the lesser, tenements, gardens,\r\nand vacant grounds, lead, stone, iron, etc., the hospital of St.\r\nBartholomew in West Smithfield, the church of the same, the lead, bells,\r\nand ornaments of the same hospital, with all the messuages, tenements,\r\nand appurtenances; the parishes of St. Nicholas and of St. Ewin, and\r\nso much of St. Sepulcher’s parish as is within Newgate, were made one\r\nparish church in the Gray Friars church, and called Christ’s church,\r\nfounded by Henry VIII.\r\n\r\nThe vicar of Christ’s church was to have twenty-six pounds thirteen\r\nshillings and four pence the year; the vicar of St. Bartholomew thirteen\r\npounds six shillings and eight pence; the visitor of Newgate (being\r\na priest), ten pounds; and other five priests in Christ’s church,\r\nall to be helping in Divine service, ministering the sacraments and\r\nsacramentals; the five priests to have eight pounds the piece, two\r\nclerks six pounds each, a sexton four pounds. Moreover, he gave them\r\nthe hospital of Bethelem; with the laver of brass in the cloister, by\r\nestimation eighteen feet in length, and two feet and a half in depth;\r\nand the water-course of lead, to the said Friar house belonging,\r\ncontaining by estimation in length eighteen acres.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1552 began the repairing of the Grey Friars house for the\r\npoor fatherless children; and in the month of November the children were\r\ntaken into the same, to the number of almost four hundred. On Christmas\r\nday, in the afternoon, while the lord mayor and aldermen rode to Paules,\r\nthe children of Christ’s hospital stood, from St. Lawrence lane end\r\nin Cheape towards Paules, all in one livery of russet cotton, three\r\nhundred and forty in number; and in Easter next they were in blue at the\r\nSpittle, and so have continued ever since.\r\n\r\nThe defaced monuments in this church were these; First in the choir,\r\nof the Lady Margaret, daughter to Philip, king of France, and wife to\r\nEdward I., foundress of this new church, 1317; of Isabel, queen, wife\r\nto Edward II., daughter to Philip, king of France, 1358; John of the\r\nTower; Queen of Scots, wife to David Bruce, daughter to Edward II.,\r\ndied in Hartford castle, and was buried by Isabel her mother 1362;\r\nWilliam Fitzwarren, baron, and Isabel his wife, sometime Queen of Man;\r\nIsabel, daughter to Edward III., wedded to the Lord Courcy of France,\r\nafter created Earl of Bedford; Elianor, wife to John, Duke of Britaine:\r\nBeatrix, Duchess of Britaine, daughter to Henry III.; Sir Robert Lisle,\r\nbaron; the Lady Lisle, and Margaret de Rivers, Countess of Devon, all\r\nunder one stone; Roger Mortimer, Earl of March, beheaded 1329; Peter,\r\nBishop of Carbon in Hungary, 1331; Gregory Rocksley, mayor, 1282; Sir\r\nJohn Devereux, knight, 1385; John Hastings, Earl of Pembroke, 1389;\r\nMargaret, daughter to Thomas Brotharton, Earl Marshal; she was Duchess\r\nof Norfolk, and Countess Marshal and Lady Segrave, 1389; Richard\r\nHavering, knight, 1388; Robert Trisilian, knight justice, 1308; Geffrey\r\nLucy, son of Geffrey Lucy; John Anbry, son to John, mayor of Norwich,\r\n1368; John Philpot, knight, mayor of London, and the Lady Jane Samford\r\nhis wife, 1384; John, Duke of Bourbon and Anjou, Earl of Claremond,\r\nMontpensier, and Baron Beaujeu, who was taken prisoner at Agincourt,\r\nkept prisoner eighteen years, and deceased 1433; Robert Chalons, knight,\r\n1439; John Chalons; Margaret, daughter to Sir John Philpot, first\r\nmarried to T.

All these and five\r\ntimes so many more have been buried there, whose monuments are wholly\r\ndefaced; for there were nine tombs of alabaster and marble, environed\r\nwith strikes of iron in the choir, and one tomb in the body of the\r\nchurch, also coped with iron, all pulled down, besides sevenscore\r\ngrave-stones of marble, all sold for fifty pounds, or thereabouts, by\r\nSir Martin Bowes, goldsmith and alderman of London. Of late time buried\r\nthere, Walter Hadden, doctor, etc. From this church west to Newgate is\r\nof this ward.\r\n\r\nNow for the south side of this ward, beginning again at the cross in\r\nCheape, from thence to Friday street, and down that street on the west\r\nside, till over against the north-west corner of St. Matthew’s church;\r\nand on the west side, to the south corner of the said church, which is\r\nwholly in the ward of Faringdon. This church hath these few monuments:\r\nThomas Pole, goldsmith, 1395; Robert Johnson, goldsmith, alderman;\r\nJohn Twiselton, goldsmith, alderman, 1525; Ralph Allen, grocer, one\r\nof the sheriffs, deceased 1546; Anthony Gamage, ironmonger, one of\r\nthe sheriffs, deceased 1579; Anthony Cage; John Mabbe, chamberlain of\r\nLondon, etc. Allen at Condit, and Thomas Warlingworth, founded a chantry\r\nthere. Sir Nicholas Twiford, goldsmith, mayor, gave to that church a\r\nhouse, with the appurtenances, called the Griffon on the Hope, in the\r\nsame street.[239]\r\n\r\nFrom this Friday street, west to the Old Exchange, a street so called\r\nof the king’s exchange there kept, which was for the receipt of bullion\r\nto be coined. For Henry III., in the 6th of his reign, wrote to the\r\nScabines and men of Ipre, that he and his council had given prohibition,\r\nthat none, Englishmen or other, should make change of plate or other\r\nmass of silver, but only in his Exchange at London, or at Canterbury.\r\nAndrew Buckerell then had to farm the Exchange of England, and was mayor\r\nof London in the reign of Henry III. John Somercote had the keeping of\r\nthe king’s Exchange over all England. In the 8th of Edward I., Gregory\r\nRockesly was keeper of the said Exchange for the king. In the 5th of\r\nEdward II., William Hausted was keeper thereof; and in the 18th, Roger\r\nde Frowicke, etc.\r\n\r\nThese received the old stamps, or coining-irons, from time to time, as\r\nthe same were worn, and delivered new to all the mints in London, as\r\nmore at large in another place I have noted.\r\n\r\nThis street beginneth by West Cheape in the north, and runneth down\r\nsouth to Knightriders street; that part thereof which is called Old Fish\r\nstreet, but the very housing and office of the Exchange and coinage was\r\nabout the midst thereof, south from the east gate that entereth Paules\r\nchurchyard, and on the west side in Baynard’s castle ward.\r\n\r\nOn the east side of this lane, betwixt West Cheape and the church of St.\r\nAugustine, Henry Walles, mayor (by license of Edward I.), built one row\r\nof houses, the profits rising of them to be employed on London bridge.\r\n\r\nThe parish church of St. Augustine, and one house next adjoining in\r\nWatheling street, is of this ward called Faringdon. This is a fair\r\nchurch, and lately well repaired, wherein be monuments remaining--of\r\nH. Reade, armourer, one of the sheriffs 1450; Robert Bellesdon,\r\nhaberdasher, mayor 1491; Sir Townley William Dere, one of the sheriffs\r\n1450; Robert Raven, haberdasher, 1500; Thomas Apleyard, gentleman,\r\n1515; William Moncaster, merchant-tailor, 1524; William Holte,\r\nmerchant-tailor, 1544, etc.\r\n\r\nThen is the north churchyard of Paules, in the which standeth the\r\ncathedral church, first founded by Ethelbert, king of Kent, about the\r\nyear of Christ 610: he gave thereto lands as appeareth:\r\n\r\n“_Ædelbertus Rex, Deo inspirante, pro animæ suæ remedio dedit episcopo\r\nMelito terram quæ appellatur Tillingeham ad monasterii sui solatium,\r\nscilicet monasterium Sancti Pauli: et ego Rex Æthelbertus ita firmiter\r\nconcedo tibi presuli Melito potestatem ejus habendi & possidendi ut in\r\nperpetuum in monasterii utilitate permaneat_,” etc. Athelstan, Edgar,\r\nEdward the Confessor, and others, also gave lands thereunto. William\r\nthe Conqueror gave to the church of St. Paule, and to Mauricius,\r\nthen bishop, and his successors, the castle of Stortford, with the\r\nappurtenances, etc. He also confirmed the gifts of his predecessors in\r\nthese words: “_W. Rex Angl. concedo Deo et S. Paulo in perpetuum, 24\r\nHidas quas Rex Æthelbert dedit S. Paulo juxta London_,” etc. The charter\r\nof King William the Conqueror, exemplified in the Tower, englished thus:\r\n\r\n“William, by the grace of God, king of Englishmen, to all his welbeloued\r\nFrench and English people, greeting: Know ye that I do giue vnto God\r\nand the church of S. Paule of London, and to the rectors and seruitors\r\nof the same, in all their lands which the church hath, or shall have,\r\nwithin borough and without, sack and sock, thole and theam, infangthefe\r\nand grithbriche, and all freeships, by strand and by land, on tide\r\nand off tide, and all the rights that into them christendome byrath,\r\non morth sprake, and on unright hamed, and on unright work, of all\r\nthat bishoprick on mine land, and on each other man’s land. For I will\r\nthat the church in all things be as free as I would my soul to be in\r\nthe day of judgement. Witnesses: Osmund, our Chancellor; Lanfrank,\r\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury; and T. Archbishop of York; Roger, Earle\r\nof Shrewesbury; Alane, the county; Geffrey de Magnavilla; and Ralph\r\nPeuerel.”\r\n\r\nIn the year 1087, this church of St. Paule was burnt with fire, and\r\ntherewith the most part of the city; which fire began at the entry of\r\nthe west gate, and consumed the east gate. Mauricius the bishop began\r\ntherefore the foundation of a new church of St. Paule, a work that men\r\nof that time judged would never have been finished, it was to them so\r\nwonderful for length and breadth; and also the same was built upon\r\narches (or vaults) of stone, for defence of fire, which was a manner\r\nof work before that time unknown to the people of this nation, and\r\nthen brought in by the French; and the stone was fetched from Caen in\r\nNormandy.\r\n\r\nThis Mauricius deceased in the year 1107. Richard Beamor succeeded\r\nhim in the bishopric, who did wonderfully increase the said church,\r\npurchasing of his own cost the large streets and lanes about it, wherein\r\nwere wont to dwell many lay people; which ground he began to compass\r\nabout with a strong wall of stone and gates. King Henry I. gave to the\r\nsaid Richard so much of the moat (or wall) of the castle, on the Thames\r\nside, to the south, as should be needful to make the said wall of the\r\nchurch, and so much as should suffice to make a wall without the way on\r\nthe north side, etc.\r\n\r\nIt should seem that this Richard inclosed but two sides of the said\r\nchurch or cemetery of St. Paule, to wit, the south and north side;\r\nfor King Edward II., in the 10th of his reign, granted that the said\r\nchurchyard should be inclosed with a wall where it wanted, for the\r\nmurders and robberies that were there committed. But the citizens then\r\nclaimed the east part of the churchyard to be the place of assembly to\r\ntheir folkemotes, and that the great steeple there situate was to that\r\nuse, their common bell, which being there rung, all the inhabitants of\r\nthe city might hear and come together. They also claimed the west side,\r\nthat they might there assemble themselves together, with the lord of\r\nBaynard’s castle, for view of their armour, in defence of the city. This\r\nmatter was in the Tower of London referred to Harvius de Stanton, and\r\nhis fellow justices itinerants; but I find not the decision or judgment\r\nof that controversy.\r\n\r\nTrue it is, that Edward III., in the 17th of his reign, gave commandment\r\nfor the finishing of that wall, which was then performed, and to this\r\nday it continueth; although now on both the sides (to wit, within and\r\nwithout) it be hidden with dwelling-houses. Richard Beamer deceased in\r\nthe year 1127, and his successors in process of time performed the work\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\nThe steeple of this church was built and finished in the year 1222; the\r\ncross on the said steeple fell down, and a new was set up in the year\r\n1314. The new work of Pauls (so called) at the east end above the choir,\r\nwas begun in the year 1251.\r\n\r\nHenry Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, constable of Chester, and custos of\r\nEngland, in his time was a great benefactor to this work, and was there\r\nburied in the year 1310. Also Ralph Baldocke, Bishop of London, in his\r\nlifetime gave two hundred marks to the building of the said new work,\r\nand left much by his testament towards the finishing thereof: he\r\ndeceased in the year 1313, and was buried in the Lady chapel. Also the\r\nnew work of Paules, to wit, the cross aisles, were begun to be new built\r\nin the year 1256.\r\n\r\nThe 1st of February, in the year 1444, about two of the clock in the\r\nafternoon, the steeple of Paules was fired by lightning, in the midst\r\nof the shaft or spire, both on the west side and on the south; but by\r\nlabour of many well-disposed people the same to appearance was quenched\r\nwith vinegar, so that all men withdrew themselves to their houses,\r\npraising God; but between eight and nine of the clock in the same night\r\nthe fire burst out again more fervently than before, and did much hurt\r\nto the lead and timber, till by the great labour of the mayor and people\r\nthat came thither, it was thoroughly quenched.\r\n\r\nThis steeple was repaired in the year 1462, and the weather-cock again\r\nerected. Robert Godwin winding it up, the rope brake, and he was\r\ndestroyed on the pinnacles, and the cock was sore bruised; but Burchwood\r\n(the king’s plumber) set it up again: since the which time, needing\r\nreparation, it was both taken down and set up in the year 1553; at which\r\ntime it was found to be of copper, gilt over; and the length from the\r\nbill to the tail being four feet, and the breadth over the wings three\r\nfeet and a half, it weighed forty pounds; the cross from the bowl to the\r\neagle (or cock) was fifteen feet and six inches, of assize; the length\r\nthereof overthwart was five feet and ten inches, and the compass of the\r\nbowl was nine feet and one inch.\r\n\r\nThe inner body of this cross was oak, the next cover was lead, and the\r\nuttermost was of copper, red varnished. The bowl and eagle, or cock,\r\nwere of copper, and gilt also.\r\n\r\nThe height of the steeple was five hundred and twenty feet, whereof the\r\nstone-work is two hundred and sixty feet, and the spire was likewise two\r\nhundred and sixty feet: the length of the whole church is two hundred\r\nand forty tailors’ yards, which make seven hundred and twenty feet;\r\nthe breadth thereof is one hundred and thirty feet, and the height of\r\nthe body of that church is one hundred and fifty feet. This church\r\nhath a bishop, a dean, a precentor, chancellor, treasurer, and five\r\narchdeacons; to wit, of London, Middlesex, Essex, Colchester, and St.\r\nAlbans: it hath prebendaries thirty, canons twelve, vicars choral six,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThe college of petty canons there was founded by King Richard II. in\r\nhonour of Queen Anne his wife, and of her progenitors, in the 17th of\r\nhis reign. Their hall and lands were then given unto them, as appeareth\r\nby the patent; Master Robert Dokesworth then being master thereof. In\r\nthe year 1408, the petty canons then building their college, the mayor\r\nand commonalty granted them their water-courses, and other easements.\r\n\r\nThere was also one great cloister, on the north side of this church,\r\nenvironing a plot of ground, of old time called Pardon churchyard;\r\nwhereof Thomas More, dean of Paules, was either the first builder, or\r\na most especial benefactor, and was buried there. About this cloister\r\nwas artificially and richly painted the Dance of Machabray, or Dance of\r\nDeath, commonly called the Dance of Paul’s; the like whereof was painted\r\nabout St. Innocent’s cloister at Paris, in France. The metres, or poesy\r\nof this dance, were translated out of French into English by John\r\nLidgate, monk of Bury,[240] and with the picture of death leading all\r\nestates, painted about the cloister, at the special request and at the\r\ndispence of Jenken Carpenter, in the reign of Henry VI. In this cloister\r\nwere buried many persons, some of worship, and others of honour; the\r\nmonuments of whom, in number and curious workmanship, passed all other\r\nthat were in that church.\r\n\r\nOver the east quadrant of this cloister was a fair library, built at\r\nthe costs and charges of Walter Sherington, chancellor of the duchy of\r\nLancaster, in the reign of Henry VI., which hath been well furnished\r\nwith fair written books in vellum, but few of them now do remain there.\r\nIn the midst of this Pardon churchyard was also a fair chapel, first\r\nfounded by Gilbert Becket, portgrave and principal magistrate of this\r\ncity, in the reign of King Stephen, who was there buried.\r\n\r\nThomas Moore, dean of Paul’s before named, re-edified or new built this\r\nchapel, and founded three chaplains there, in the reign of Henry V.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1549, on the 10th of April, the said chapel, by commandment\r\nof the Duke of Somerset, was begun to be pulled down, with the whole\r\ncloister, the Dance of Death, the tombs and monuments; so that nothing\r\nthereof was left but the bare plot of ground, which is since converted\r\ninto a garden for the petty canons. There was also a chapel at the north\r\ndoor of Paules, founded by the same Walter Sherrington, by license\r\nof Henry VI., for two, three, or four chaplains, endowed with forty\r\npounds, by the year. This chapel also was pulled down in the reign of\r\nEdward VI., and in place thereof a fair house built.\r\n\r\nThere was furthermore a fair chapel of the Holy Ghost in Paules church,\r\non the north side, founded in the year 1400 by Roger Holmes, chancellor\r\nand prebendary of Paules, for Adam Berie, alderman, mayor of London\r\n1364, John Wingham and others, for seven chaplains, and called Holme’s\r\ncollege. Their common hall was in Paul’s churchyard, on the south\r\nside, near unto a carpenter’s yard. This college was, with others,\r\nsuppressed in the reign of Edward VI. Then under the choir of Paules is\r\na large chapel, first dedicated to the name of Jesu, founded, or rather\r\nconfirmed, the 37th of Henry VI., as appeareth by his patent thereof,\r\ndated at Croydone, to this effect: “Many liege men, and Christian\r\npeople, having begun a fraternitie and guild, to the honour of the most\r\nglorious name of Jesus Christ our Saviour, in a place called the Crowdes\r\nof the cathedrall church of Paul’s in London, which hath continued long\r\ntime peaceably till now of late; whereupon they have made request, and\r\nwe have taken upon us the name and charge of the foundation, to the\r\nlaud of Almightie God, the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghost, and\r\nespecially to the honour of Jesu, in whose honour the fraternitie was\r\nbegun,” etc.\r\n\r\nThe king ordained William Say, then dean of Paules, to be the rector,\r\nand Richard Ford (a remembrancer in the Exchequer), and Henry Bennis\r\n(clerk of his privy seal), the guardians of those brothers and sisters;\r\nthey and their successors to have a common seal, license to purchase\r\nlands or tenements to the value of forty pounds by the year, etc.\r\n\r\nThis foundation was confirmed by Henry VII., the 22nd of his reign, to\r\nDoctor Collet, then dean of Paules, rector there, etc.; and by Henry\r\nVIII., the 27th of his reign, to Richard Pace, then dean of Paules, etc.\r\n\r\nAt the west end of this Jesus chapel, under the choir of Paules, also\r\nwas a parish church of St. Faith, commonly called St. Faith under\r\nPaul’s, which served for the stationers and others dwelling in Paule’s\r\nchurchyard, Paternoster row, and the places near adjoining. The said\r\nchapel of Jesus being suppressed in the reign of Edward VI., the\r\nparishioners of St. Faith’s church were removed into the same, as to a\r\nplace more sufficient for largeness and lightsomeness, in the year 1551,\r\nand so it remaineth.\r\n\r\nThen was there on the north side of this churchyard a large charnel\r\nhouse for the bones of the dead, and over it a chapel of an old\r\nfoundation, such as followeth. In the year 1282, the 10th of Edward\r\nI., it was agreed, that Henry Walles, mayor, and the citizens, for\r\nthe cause of shops by them built, without the wall of the churchyard,\r\nshould assign to God and to the church of St. Paul ten marks of rent by\r\nthe year for ever, towards the new building of a chapel of the Blessed\r\nVirgin Mary, and also to assign five marks of yearly rent to a chaplain\r\nto celebrate there.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in the year 1430, the 8th of Henry VI., license was granted\r\nto Jenkin Carpenter (executor to Richard Whittington) to establish upon\r\nthe said charnel a chaplain, to have eight marks by the year. Then was\r\nalso in this chapel two brotherhoods. In this chapel were buried Robert\r\nBarton, Henry Barton, mayor, and Thomas Mirfin, mayor, all skinners, and\r\nwere entombed with their images of alabaster over them, grated or coped\r\nabout with iron before the said chapel, all which were pulled down in\r\nthe year 1549: the bones of the dead, couched up in a charnel under the\r\nchapel, were conveyed from thence into Finsbery field (by report of him\r\nwho paid for the carriage[241]), amounting to more than one thousand\r\ncart-loads, and there laid on a moorish ground; in short space after\r\nraised, by soilage of the city upon them, to bear three windmills. The\r\nchapel and charnel were converted into dwelling-houses, warehouses, and\r\nsheds before them, for stationers, in place of the tombs.\r\n\r\nIn the east part of this churchyard standeth Paules school, lately new\r\nbuilt, and endowed in the year 1512 by John Collet, doctor of divinity\r\nand dean of Paules, for one hundred and fifty-three poor men’s children,\r\nto be taught free in the same school; for which he appointed a master,\r\na surmaster, or usher, and a chaplain, with large stipends for ever,\r\ncommitting the oversight thereof to the masters, wardens, and assistants\r\nof the mercers in London, because he was[242] son to Henry Collet,\r\nmercer, sometime mayor. He left to these mercers lands to the yearly\r\nvalue of one hundred and twenty pounds, or better.\r\n\r\nNear unto this school, on the north side thereof, was of old time a\r\ngreat and high clochier, or bell-house, four square, built of stone, and\r\nin the same a most strong frame of timber, with four bells, the greatest\r\nthat I have heard; these were called Jesus’ bells, and belonged to\r\nJesus’ chapel, but I know not by whose gift: the same had a great spire\r\nof timber covered with lead, with the image of St. Paul on the top, but\r\nwas pulled down by Sir Miles Partridge, knight, in the reign of Henry\r\nVIII. The common speech then was, that he did set a hundred pounds upon\r\na cast at dice against it, and so won the said clochiard and bells of\r\nthe king; and then causing the bells to be broken as they hung, the rest\r\nwas pulled down. This man was afterward executed on the Tower hill for\r\nmatters concerning the Duke of Somerset, the 5th of Edward VI.\r\n\r\nIn place of this clochiard, of old times the common bell of the city was\r\nused to be rung for the assembly of the citizens to their folke motes,\r\nas I have before showed.\r\n\r\nAbout the midst of this churchyard is a pulpit cross of timber, mounted\r\nupon steps of stone, and covered with lead, in which are sermons\r\npreached by learned divines every Sunday in the forenoon; the very\r\nantiquity of which cross is to me unknown. I read, that in the year\r\n1259, King Henry III. commanded a general assembly to be made at this\r\ncross, where he in proper person commanded the mayor, that on the next\r\nday following, he should cause to be sworn before the alderman every\r\nstripling of twelve years of age or upward, to be true to the king and\r\nhis heirs, kings of England. Also, in the year 1262, the same king\r\ncaused to be read at Paul’s cross a bull, obtained from Pope Urban IV.,\r\nas an absolution for him, and for all that were sworn to maintain the\r\narticles made in parliament at Oxford. Also in the year 1299, the dean\r\nof Paules accursed at Paules cross all those which had searched in the\r\nchurch of St. Martin in the Field for a hoard of gold, etc. This pulpit\r\ncross was by tempest of lightning and thunder defaced. Thomas Kempe,\r\nBishop of London, new built it in form as it now standeth.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1561, the 4th of June, betwixt the hours of three and four\r\nof the clock in the afternoon, the great spire of the steeple of St.\r\nPaule’s church was fired by lightning, which brake forth (as it seemed)\r\ntwo or three yards beneath the foot of the cross; and from thence it\r\nwent downward the spire to the battlements, stone-work, and bells,\r\nso furiously, that within the space of four hours the same steeple,\r\nwith all the roofs of the church, were consumed, to the great sorrow\r\nand perpetual remembrance of the beholders. After this mischance, the\r\nqueen’s majesty directed her letters to the mayor, willing him to take\r\norder for the speedy repairing of the same: and she, of her gracious\r\ndisposition, for the furtherance thereof, did presently give and deliver\r\nin gold one thousand marks, with a warrant for a thousand loads of\r\ntimber, to be taken out of her woods or elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe citizens also gave first a great benevolence, and after that three\r\nfifteens, to be speedily paid. The clergy of England likewise, within\r\nthe province of Canterbury, granted the fortieth part of the value of\r\ntheir benefices, charged with first fruits, the thirtieth part of such\r\nas were not so charged; but the clergy of London diocese granted the\r\nthirtieth part of all that paid first fruits, and the twentieth part of\r\nsuch as had paid their fruits.\r\n\r\nSix citizens of London, and two petty canons of Paules church, had\r\ncharge to further and oversee the work, wherein such expedition was\r\nused, that within one month next following the burning thereof, the\r\nchurch was covered with boards and lead, in manner of a false roof,\r\nagainst the weather; and before the end of the said year, all the said\r\naisles of the church were framed out of new timber, covered with lead,\r\nand fully finished. The same year also the great roofs of the west and\r\neast ends were framed out of great timber in Yorkshire, brought thence\r\nto London by sea, and set up and covered with lead; the north and south\r\nends were framed of timber, and covered with lead, before April 1566.\r\nConcerning the steeple, divers models were devised and made, but little\r\nelse was done, through whose default, God knoweth; it was said that the\r\nmoney appointed for new building of the steeple was collected.[243]\r\n\r\nMonuments in this church be these: first, as I read, of Erkenwalde,\r\nBishop of London, buried in the old church about the year of Christ 700,\r\nwhose body was translated into the new work in the year 1140, being\r\nrichly shrined above the choir behind the high altar.\r\n\r\nSebba, or Seba, King of the East Saxons, first buried in the old church,\r\nsince removed into the new, and laid in a coffin of stone, on the north\r\nside without the choirs; Ethelred, King of the West Saxons, was likewise\r\nburied and removed; William Norman, Bishop of London in the reigns of\r\nEdward the Confessor and of William the Conqueror, deceased 1070, and\r\nis new buried in the body of the church, with an epitaph, as in my\r\n_Summary_ I have shown; Eustauchius de Fauconbridge, Bishop of London,\r\n1228, buried in the south isle above the choir; Martin Pateshull,\r\nDean of Powle’s, 1239; W. Havarhul, canon; the king’s treasurer, Hugh\r\nPateshull, 1240; Roger Nigar, Bishop of London, 1241, buried in the\r\nnorth side of the choir; Fulco Basset, Bishop of London, 1259, and his\r\nbrother, Philip Basset, knight, 1261; Henry Wingham, Bishop of London,\r\nburied in the south aisle above the choir, 1262; Geffrey de Arca,\r\nchaplain in the chapel of St. James, under the rood at north door, 1264;\r\nAlexander de Swarford, 1273; John Grantham, 1273; John Braynford, and\r\nRichard Umframuile, 1275; Roger de Iale, Archdeacon of Essex, 1280;\r\nRalph Donion, canon, 1382; Godfrey S. Donstan, 1274; Fulke Lovell, 1298;\r\nWilliam Harworth, clerk, 1302; Reginald Brandon, in the new Lady chapel,\r\n1305; Richard Newporte, Archdeacon of Middlesex, 1309; Henry Lacie, Earl\r\nof Lincolne, in the new work of Paules betwixt the Lady chapel and St.\r\nDunston’s chapel, where a fair monument was raised for him, with his\r\npicture in armour, cross-legged, as one professed for defence of the\r\nHoly Land against the infidels, 1310, his monument is foully defaced;\r\nRalph Baldoke, Bishop of London, 1313, in the said Lady chapel, whereof\r\nhe was founder.\r\n\r\nSome have noted,[244] that in digging the foundation of this new work,\r\nnamely of a chapel on the south side of Paule’s church, there were found\r\nmore than a hundred scalps of oxen or kine, in the year 1316; which\r\nthing (say they) confirmed greatly the opinion of those which have\r\nreported, that of old time there had been a temple of Jupiter, and that\r\nthere was daily sacrifice of beasts.\r\n\r\nOthersome, both wise and learned, have thought the buck’s head, borne\r\nbefore the procession of Paule’s on St. Paul’s day, to signify the like.\r\nBut true it is, I have read an ancient deed to this effect.\r\n\r\nSir William Baud, knight, the 3rd of Edward I., in the year 1274, on\r\nCandlemas day, granted to Harvy de Borham, dean of Powle’s, and to the\r\nchapter there, that in consideration of twenty-two acres of ground or\r\nland, by them granted, within their manor of Westley in Essex, to be\r\ninclosed into his park of Curingham, he would for ever, upon the feast\r\nday of the Conversion of St. Paul in winter, give unto them a good doe,\r\nseasonable and sweet, and upon the feast of the commemoration of St.\r\nPaul in summer, a good buck, and offer the same upon the high altar; the\r\nsame to be spent amongst the canons residents. The doe to be brought by\r\none man at the hour of procession, and through the procession to the\r\nhigh altar; and the bringer to have nothing: the buck to be brought\r\nby all his men in like manner, and they to have paid unto them by the\r\nchamberlain of the church twelve pence only, and no more to be required.\r\nThis grant he made, and for performance bound the lands of him and his\r\nheirs to be distrained on; and if the lands should be evicted, that\r\nyet he and his heirs should accomplish the gift. Witnesses: Richard\r\nTilberie, William de Wockendon, Richard de Harlowe, knights, Peter of\r\nStanforde, Thomas of Waldon, and some others.\r\n\r\nSir Walter Baude, son to William, confirmed this gift, in the 30th of\r\nthe said king, and the witnesses thereunto were Nicholas de Wokendon,\r\nRichard de Rokeley, Thomas de Mandevile, John de Rochford, knights,\r\nRichard de Broniford, William de Markes, William de Fulham, and other.\r\nThus much for the grant.\r\n\r\nNow what I have heard by report, and have partly seen, it followeth.\r\nOn the feast day of the commemoration of St. Paul, the buck being\r\nbrought up to the steps of the high altar in Paul’s church, at the\r\nhour of procession, the dean and chapter being apparelled in copes and\r\nvestments, with garlands of roses on their heads, they sent the body\r\nof the buck to baking, and had the head fixed on a pole, borne before\r\nthe cross in their procession, until they issued out of the west door,\r\nwhere the keeper that brought it blowed the death of the buck, and then\r\nthe horners that were about the city presently answered him in like\r\nmanner; for the which pains they had each one of the dean and chapter,\r\nfour pence in money, and their dinner, and the keeper that brought it,\r\nwas allowed during his abode there, for that service, meat, drink, and\r\nlodging, at the dean and chapter’s charges, and five shillings in money\r\nat his going away, together with a loaf of bread, having the picture of\r\nSt. Paul upon it, etc.\r\n\r\nThere was belonging to the church of St. Paul, for both the days, two\r\nspecial suits of vestments, the one embroidered with bucks, the other\r\nwith does, both given by the said Bauds (as I have heard). Thus much for\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\nNow to the residue of the monuments:--Sir Ralph Hingham, chief justice\r\nof both Benches successively, buried in the side of the north walk\r\nagainst the choir, 1308; Henry Guildford, clerk at the altar of the\r\nApostles, 1313; Richard Newport, Bishop of London, 1318; William\r\nChateslehunt, canon, in the new work, 1321, had a chantry there; Sir\r\nNicholas Wokenden, knight, at the altar of St. Thomas in the new work,\r\n1323; John Cheshull, Bishop of London, 1279; Roger Waltham, canon,\r\n1325; Hamo Chikewell, six times mayor of London, 1328; Robert Monden,\r\nand John Monden his brother, canons, in the new work, 1332; Walter\r\nThorpe, canon, in the new work, 1333; John Fable, 1334; James Fisil,\r\nchaplain, 1341; William Melford, Archdeacon of Colchester, 1345;\r\nRichard de Placeto, Archdeacon of Colchester, 1345, before St. Thomas’\r\nchapel; Geffrey Eton, canon, 1345; Nicholas Husband, canon, 1347; Sir\r\nJohn Poultney, mayor 1348, in a fair chapel by him built on the north\r\nside of Paule’s, wherein he founded three chaplains; William Eversden,\r\ncanon, in the crowds, 1349; Alan Hotham, canon, in the new crowds, 1351;\r\nHenry Etesworth, under the rood at north door, 1353; John Beauchampe,\r\nconstable of Dover, warden of the ports, knight of the Garter, son to\r\nGuy Beauchampe, Earl of Warwick, and brother to Thomas Earl of Warwick,\r\nin the body of the church, on the south side, 1358, where a proper\r\nchapel and fair monument remaineth of him; he is by ignorant people\r\nmisnamed to be Humfrey, Duke of Glocester, who lieth honourably buried\r\nat St. Albon’s, twenty miles from London, and therefore such as merrily\r\nor simply profess themselves to serve Duke Humfrey in Paule’s, are to\r\nbe punished here, and sent to St. Albon’s, there again to be punished\r\nfor their absence from their lord and master, as they call him; Michael\r\nNorborow, Bishop of London, 1361; Walter Nele, blader, and Avis his\r\nwife, 1361; Gilbert Brewer, dean of Paule’s, 1366; Richard Wendover,\r\n1366; John Hiltoft, goldsmith, and Alice his wife, in the new works,\r\nSt. Dunston’s chapel, 1368; Adam de Bery, mayor in the year 1364,\r\nburied in a chapel of St. Mary Magdalen, or of the Holy Ghost, called\r\nHolmes’ college, behind the rood at the north door of Paul’s, 1390;\r\nRoger Holmes, chancellor and prebend of Paul’s, was buried there 1400;\r\nJohn of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, 1399, buried on the north side the\r\nchoir, beside Blanch his first wife, who deceased 1368; Sir Richard\r\nBurley, knight of the Garter, under a fair monument in the side of the\r\nnorth walk against the choir, a chantry was there founded for him,\r\n1409; Beatrix his wife, after his death, married to Thomas Lord Rouse,\r\nwas buried in the chapel of St. John Baptist (or Poultney’s chapel)\r\nnear the north door of Paule’s, 1409; Thomas Evers, dean of Paule’s, in\r\nSt. Thomas’ chapel, the new work, 1411; Thomas More, dean of Paule’s,\r\nin the chapel of St. Anne and St. Thomas, by him new built in Pardon\r\nchurchyard, 1419; Thomas Ston, dean of Paule’s, by the tomb of John\r\nBeauchampe, 1423; the Duchess of Bedford, sister to Philip Duke of\r\nBurgoyne, 1433; Robert Fitzhugh, Bishop of London, in the choir, 1435;\r\nWalter Sherington, in a chapel without the north door by him built,\r\n1457; John Drayton, goldsmith, in Alhallowes chapel, 1456; William\r\nSay, dean of Paul’s, in the Crowds, or Jesus’ chapel, 1468; Margaret,\r\nCountess of Shrewsbury, in the Crowds, or Jesus’ chapel, as appeareth by\r\nan inscription on a pillar there.\r\n\r\nHere before the image of Jesu lieth the worshipful and right noble lady,\r\nMargaret Countess of Shrewsbury, late wife of the true and victorious\r\nknight and redoubtable warrior, John Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, which\r\nworship died in Guien for the right of this land.

Amen.\r\n\r\nJohn Wenlocke, by his last will, dated 1477, appointed there should\r\nbe dispended upon a monument over the Lady of Shrewsbury where she is\r\nburied afore Jesus, one hundred pounds. He left Sir Humfrey Talbot his\r\nsupervisor. This Sir Humfrey Talbot, knight, lord marshal of the town of\r\nCalais, made his will the year 1492. He was younger son of John Earl of\r\nShrewsbury, and Margaret his wife; he appointed a stone to be put in a\r\npillar before the grave of his lady mother in Paul’s, of his portraiture\r\nand arms, according to the will of John Wenlocke, but for want of room\r\nand lightsomeness in that place, it was concluded, the image of Jesus to\r\nbe curiously painted on the wall of Paul’s church, over the door that\r\nentereth into the said chapel of Jesus, and the portraiture also of the\r\nsaid Lady Margaret, Countess of Shrewsbury, kneeling in her mantle of\r\narms, with her progeny; all which was so performed, and remaineth till\r\nthis day.\r\n\r\nIn the chapel of Jesus, Thomas Dowcrey, William Lambe, 1578, and many\r\nother, have been interred; John of London, under the north rood, 1266;\r\nJohn Lovell, clerk; John Romane; John of St. Olave; Waltar Bloxley;\r\nSir Alen Boxhull, knight of the Garter, constable of the Tower, custos\r\nof the forest and park of Clarendon, the forest of Brokholt, Grovell,\r\nand Melchet, buried beside St. Erkenwald’s shrine, and of later time\r\nThomas Kempe, Bishop of London, in a proper chapel of the Trinity by\r\nhim founded in the body of the church, on the north side, 1489; Thomas\r\nLinacre, doctor of physic; John Collet, dean of Paule’s, on the south\r\nside without the choir, 1519; John Dowman, canon of Paule’s, 1525;\r\nRichard Fitz-James, Bishop of London, hard beneath the north-west\r\npillar of Paule’s steeple, under a fair tomb, and a chapel of St. Paul,\r\nbuilt of timber, with stairs mounting thereunto over his tomb, of grey\r\nmarble, 1521. His chapel was burned by fire falling from the steeple,\r\nhis tomb was taken thence. John Stokesley, Bishop of London, in our\r\nLady chapel, 1539; John Nevill, Lord Latimer, in a chapel by the north\r\ndoor of Paule’s, about 1542; Sir John Mason, knight, in the north walk,\r\nagainst the choir, 1566; William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke, knight of\r\nthe Garter, on the north side of the choir, 1569; Sir Nicholas Bacon,\r\nlord-keeper of the great seal, on the south side of the choir, 1578;\r\nSir Philip Sidney, above the choir on the north side, 1586; Sir Frances\r\nWalsingham, knight, principal secretary, and chancellor of the duchy of\r\nLancaster, 1590; Sir Christopher Hatton, lord chancellor of England,\r\nknight of the Garter, above the choir, 1591, under a most sumptuous\r\nmonument, where a merry poet wrote thus:--\r\n\r\n    “Philip and Francis have no tombe,\r\n    For _great_ Christopher takes all the roome.”\r\n\r\nJohn Elmer, Bishop of London, before St. Thomas’ chapel, 1594; the Lady\r\nHeneage, and her husband, Sir Thomas Heneage, chancellor of the duchy,\r\n1595; Richard Fletcher, Bishop of London, 1596. These, as the chief,\r\nhave I noted to be buried there.\r\n\r\nWithout the north gate of Paule’s church from the end of the Old\r\nExchange, west up Paternoster row, by the two lanes out of Paule’s\r\nchurch, the first out of the cross aisle of Paule’s, the other out of\r\nthe body of the church, about the midst thereof, and so west to the\r\nGolden Lion, be all of this ward, as is aforesaid. The houses in this\r\nstreet, from the first north gate of Paule’s churchyard unto the next\r\ngate, was first built without the wall of the churchyard, by Henry\r\nWalles, mayor in the year 1282. The rents of those houses go to the\r\nmaintenance of London bridge. This street is now called Pater Noster\r\nrow, because of stationers or text writers that dwelt there, who wrote\r\nand sold all sorts of books then in use, namely, A. B. C. with the Pater\r\nNoster, Ave, Creed, Graces, etc.\r\n\r\nThere dwelt also turners of beads, and they were called Pater Noster\r\nmakers, as I read in a record of one Robert Nikke, Pater Noster maker,\r\nand citizen, in the reign of Henry IV., and so of other. At the end of\r\nPater Noster row is Ave Mary lane, so called upon the like occasion of\r\ntext writers and bead makers then dwelling there; and at the end of\r\nthat lane is likewise Creede lane, late so called, but sometime Spurrier\r\nrow, of spurriers dwelling there; and Amen lane is added thereunto\r\nbetwixt the south end of Warwicke lane and the north end of Ave Mary\r\nlane. At the north end of Ave Mary lane is one great house, built of\r\nstone and timber, of old time pertaining to John Duke of Britaine, Earl\r\nof Richmond, as appeareth by the records of Edward II., since that, it\r\nis called Pembrook’s inn, near unto Ludgate, as belonging to the earls\r\nof Pembrook, in the times of Richard II., the 18th year, and of Henry\r\nVI., the 14th year. It is now called Burgaveny house, and belongeth to\r\nHenry, late Lord of Burgaveny.\r\n\r\nBetwixt the south end of Ave Mary lane, and the north end of Creed lane,\r\nis the coming out of Paule’s church yard on the east, and the high\r\nstreet on the west, towards Ludgate, and this is called Bowyer row, of\r\nbowyers dwelling there in old time, now worn out by mercers and others.\r\nIn this street, on the north side, is the parish church of St. Martin,\r\na proper church, and lately new built; for in the year 1437, John\r\nMichael, mayor, and the commonalty, granted to William Downe, parson\r\nof St. Martin’s at Ludgate, a parcel of ground, containing in length\r\ntwenty-eight feet, and in breadth four feet, to set and build their\r\nsteeple upon, etc. The monuments here have been of William Sevenoake,\r\nmayor 1418; Henry Belwase and John Gest, 1458; William Taverner,\r\ngentleman, 1466; John Barton, esquire, 1439; Stephen Peacock, mayor\r\n1533; Sir Roger Cholmley, John Went, and Roger Paine, had chantries\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of this street is the turning into the Black Friers,\r\nwhich order sometime had their houses in Old borne, where they remained\r\nfor the space of fifty-five years, and then in the year 1276, Gregorie\r\nRoksley, mayor, and the barons of this city, granted and gave to Robert\r\nKilwarby, Archbishop of Canterbury, two lanes or ways next the street of\r\nBaynard’s castle, and also the tower of Mountfitchit, to be destroyed;\r\nin place of which the said Robert built the late new church of the Black\r\nFriers, and placed them therein. King Edward I., and Elianor his wife,\r\nwere great benefactors thereunto. This was a large church, and richly\r\nfurnished with ornaments, wherein divers parliaments, and other great\r\nmeetings, hath been holden; namely, in the year 1450, the 28th of Henry\r\nVI., a parliament was begun at Westminster, and adjourned to the Black\r\nFriers in London, and from thence to Leycester. In the year 1522, the\r\nEmperor Charles V. was lodged there. In the year 1524, the 15th of\r\nApril, a parliament was begun at the Black Friers, wherein was demanded\r\na subsidy of eight hundred thousand pounds to be raised of goods and\r\nlands, four shillings in every pound, and in the end was granted two\r\nshillings of the pound of goods or lands that were worth twenty pounds,\r\nor might dispend twenty pounds by the year, and so upward, to be paid\r\nin two years. This parliament was adjourned to Westminster amongst the\r\nblack monks, and ended in the king’s palace there, the 14th of August,\r\nat nine of the clock in the night, and was therefore called the Black\r\nparliament. In the year 1529, Cardinal Campeius, the legate, with\r\nCardinal Woolsey, sat at the said Black Friars, where before them, as\r\nlegates and judges, was brought in question the king’s marriage with\r\nQueen Katherine, as unlawful, before whom the king and queen were cited\r\nand summoned to appear, etc. whereof more at large in my _Annals_ I have\r\ntouched.\r\n\r\nThe same year, in the month of October, began a parliament in the Black\r\nFriers, in the which Cardinal Woolsey was condemned in the premunire;\r\nthis house, valued at £104 15_s._ 5_d._, was surrendered the 12th of\r\nNovember, the 30th of Henry VIII. There were buried in this church,\r\nMargaret Queen of Scots; Hubert de Burgh, Earl of Kent, translated from\r\ntheir old church by Oldborne; Robert de Attabeto, Earl of Bellimon; Dame\r\nIsabel, wife to Sir Roger Bygot, earl marshal; William and Jane Huse,\r\nchildren to Dame Ellis, Countess of Arundell; and by them lieth Dame\r\nEllis, daughter to the Earl Warren, and after Countess of Arundell;\r\nDame Ide, wife to Sir Waltar ----, daughter to Ferrers of Chartley;\r\nRichard de Brewes; Richard Strange, son to Roger Strange; Elizabeth,\r\ndaughter to Sir Barthol.

Valence; Sir William Thorpe, justice;\r\nthe Lord Lioth of Ireland; Maude, wife to Geffrey Say, daughter to the\r\nEarl of Warwick; Dame Sible, daughter to Wil. Pattehulle, wife to Roger\r\nBeauchampe; and by her Sir Richard or Roger Beauchampe; Lord St. Amand,\r\nand Dame Elizabeth his wife, daughter to the Duke of Lancaster; Sir\r\nStephen Collington, knight; Sir William Peter, knight; the Countess of\r\nHuntington; Duchess of Excester, 1425; Sir John Cornwall; Lord Fanhope,\r\ndied at Amphill in Bedfordshire, and was buried here in 1443; Sir John\r\nTriptoste, Earl of Worcester, beheaded 1470; and by him in his chapel,\r\nJames Tuochet Lord Audley, beheaded 1497; William Paston, and Anne,\r\ndaughter to Edmond Lancaster; the Lord Beamount; Sir Edmond Cornewall,\r\nBaron of Burford; the Lady Nevell, wedded to Lord Dowglas, daughter\r\nto the Duke of Excester; Richard Scrope, esquire; Dame Katheren Vaux,\r\n_alias_ Cobham; Sir Thomas Browne, and Dame Elizabeth his wife; Jane\r\nPowell; Thomas Swinforth; John Mawsley, esquire, 1432; John De la Bere,\r\nNicholas Eare, Geffrey Spring, William Clifford, esquires; Sir Thomas\r\nBrandon, knight of the Garter, 1509; William Stalworth, merchant-tailor,\r\n1518; William Courtney, Earl of Devonshire nominate, but not created,\r\nthe 3rd of Henry VIII., etc.\r\n\r\nThere is a parish of St. Anne within the precinct of the Black Friers,\r\nwhich was pulled down with the Friers’ church, by Sir Thomas Carden;\r\nbut in the reign of Queen Mary, he being forced to find a church to\r\nthe inhabitants, allowed them a lodging chamber above a stair, which\r\nsince that time, to wit, in the year 1597, fell down, and was again by\r\ncollection therefore made, new built and enlarged in the same year, and\r\nwas dedicated on the 11th of December.\r\n\r\nNow to turn again out of the Black Friers through Bowyer row, Ave Mary\r\nlane, and Pater Noster row, to the church of St. Michael _ad Bladum_,\r\nor at the corne (corruptly at the querne), so called, because in place\r\nthereof was sometime a corn market, stretching by west to the shambles.\r\nIt seemeth that the church was new built[245] about the reign of Edward\r\nIII. Thomas Newton, first parson there, was buried in the choir the\r\nyear 1461. At the east end of this church stood a cross, called the old\r\ncross in West Cheape, which was taken down in the year 1390; since the\r\nwhich time the said parish church was also taken down, but new built\r\nand enlarged in the year 1430, the 8th of Henry VI. William Eastfield,\r\nmayor, and the commonalty, granted of the common soil of the city three\r\nfeet and a half in breadth on the north part, and four feet in breadth\r\ntoward the east. This is now a proper church, and hath the monuments\r\nof Thomas Newton, first parson; Roger Woodcocke, hatter, 1475; Thomas\r\nRossel, brewer, 1473; John Hulton, stationer, 1475; John Oxney; Roger\r\nNorth, merchant-haberdasher, 1509; John Leiland, the famous antiquary;\r\nHenry Pranell, vintner, one of the sheriffs 1585; William Erkin, one of\r\nthe sheriffs 1586; Thomas Bankes, barber-chirurgeon, 1598, etc. John\r\nMundham had a chantry there in the reign of Edward II.\r\n\r\nAt the east end of this church, in place of the old cross, is now a\r\nwater-conduit placed. W. Eastfield, mayor the 9th of Henry VI., at the\r\nrequest of divers common councils, granted it so to be; whereupon, in\r\nthe 19th of the same Henry, one thousand marks were granted by a common\r\ncouncil towards the works of this conduit, and the reparations of other:\r\nthis is called the little conduit in West Cheape by Paule’s gate. At the\r\nwest end of this parish church is a small passage for people on foot\r\nthrough the same church; and west from the said church, some distance,\r\nis another passage out of Pater Noster row, and is called, of such a\r\nsign, Panyar alley, which cometh out into the north over against St.\r\nMartin’s lane. Next is Ivie lane, so called of ivy growing on the walls\r\nof the prebend[246] houses; but now the lane is replenished on both\r\nsides with fair houses, and divers offices be there kept by registers,\r\nnamely, for the Prerogative Court of the Archbishop of Canterbury,\r\nthe probate of wills, and for the lord treasurer’s remembrance of the\r\nexchequer, etc.\r\n\r\nThis lane runneth north to the west end of St. Nicholas shambles. Of old\r\ntime was one great house sometimes belonging to the Earls of Britain,\r\nsince that to the Lovels, and was called Lovels’ inn; for Mathild, wife\r\nto John Lovell, held it in the 1st of Henry VI. Then is Eldenese lane,\r\nwhich stretcheth north to the high street of Newgate market; the same\r\nis now called Warwicke lane, of an ancient house there built by an Earl\r\nof Warwicke, and was since called Warwicke inn. It is in record called\r\na messuage in Eldenese lane, in the parish of St. Sepulchre, the 28th\r\nof Henry the VI. Cicille Duchess of Warwicke possessed it. Now again\r\nfrom the conduit by Paule’s gate on the north side is a large street\r\nrunning west to Newgate, the first part whereof, from the conduit to\r\nthe shambles, is of selling bladders there, called Bladder street.\r\nThen behind the butchers’ shops be now divers slaughter houses inward,\r\nand tippling houses outward. This is called Mountgodard street of the\r\ntippling houses there, and the goddards mounting from the tap to the\r\ntable, from the table to the mouth, and sometimes over the head. This\r\nstreet goeth up to the north end of Ivie lane.\r\n\r\nBefore this Mountgodard street stall boards were of old time set up by\r\nthe butchers to show and sell their flesh meat upon, over the which\r\nstallboards they first built sheds to keep off the weather; but since\r\nthat, encroaching by little and little, they have made their stallboards\r\nand sheds fair houses, meet for the principal shambles. Next is Newgate\r\nmarket, first of corn and meal, and then of other victuals, which\r\nstretcheth almost to Eldenese lane. A fair, new, and strong frame of\r\ntimber, covered with lead, was therefore set up at the charges of the\r\ncity, near to the west corner of St. Nicholas’ shambles, for the meal to\r\nbe weighed, in the 1st of Edward VI., Sir John Gresham being then mayor.\r\nOn this side the north corner of Eldenese lane stood sometime a proper\r\nparish church of St. Ewine, as is before said, given by Henry VIII.,\r\ntowards the erecting of Christ’s church; it was taken down, and in place\r\nthereof a fair strong frame of timber erected, wherein dwell men of\r\ndivers trades. And from this frame to Newgate is all of this ward, and\r\nso an end thereof.\r\n\r\nIt hath an alderman, his deputy, common council twelve, constables\r\nseventeen, scavengers eighteen, wardmote inquest eighteen, and a beadle.\r\nAnd is taxed to the fifteen fifty pounds.[247]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[232] The word _clove_ is from the Anglo-Saxon _Clifian_ (the low German\r\n_Klöven_, and Dutch _Klooven_), to split, or _clufe_, an ear of corn\r\nor _clove_ of garlic. In this case the flower is the common Stock,\r\nor Stock Gilliflower, so long a favourite in the gardens of England,\r\nand indeed a native of the cliffs by the sea-side. “The old English\r\nname of Gilliflower,” says the author of the _Flora Domestica_, “which\r\nis now almost lost in the prefix Stock, is corrupted from the French\r\n_Giroflier_. Chaucer writes it _Gylofre_; but, by associating it with\r\nthe nutmeg and other spices, appears to mean the clove-tree, which is in\r\nfact the proper signification of that word. Turner calls it _Gelover_\r\nand _Gelyflower_, Gerrarde and Parkinson _Gilloflower_.”\r\n\r\n[233] The Anglo-Saxon _Gærsuma_--treasure, riches, fine, etc.\r\n\r\n[234] “John Palmer.”--_1st edition_, p. 252.\r\n\r\n[235] “John Standelfe and John Standelfe.”--_1st edition_, p. 253.\r\n\r\n[236] “The maior and communalty of London, parsons of Christ’s church,\r\nthe vicar to be at their appointment.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\n[237] “Treasurer of England.”--_1st edition_, p. 258.\r\n\r\n[238] “And father to Edward Lord Mountjoy; James Blunt, knighte, son to\r\nWalter Blunt, captain of Gwynes, 1492.”--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n[239] In the first edition, Sir Nicholas Twiford is described as having\r\na monument in the church.\r\n\r\n[240] Lydgate’s verses were first printed at the end of Tottell’s\r\nedition of the translation of his _Fall of Princes_, from Boccaccio,\r\n1554, folio, and afterwards in Sir W.

Then is also a\r\npart of Watheling street of this ward, to wit, from over against the\r\nLion on the north side up almost to Paule’s gate, for it lacketh but one\r\nhouse of St. Augustine’s church. And on the south side, from the Red\r\nLion gate to the Old Exchange, and down the same exchange on the east\r\nside by the west end of Mayden lane, or Distar lane, to Knightriders\r\nstreet, or, as they call that part thereof, Old Fish street. And all the\r\nnorth side of the said Old Fish street to the south end of Bread street,\r\nand by that still in Knightriders street till over against the Trinity\r\nchurch and Trinity lane. Then is Bread street itself, so called of bread\r\nin old time there sold; for it appeareth by records, that in the year\r\n1302, which was the 30th of Edward I., the bakers of London were bound\r\nto sell no bread in their shops or houses, but in the market, and that\r\nthey should have four hallmotes in the year, at four several terms, to\r\ndetermine of enormities belonging to the said company.\r\n\r\nThis street giving the name to the whole ward, beginneth in West Cheap,\r\nalmost by the Standard, and runneth down south through or thwart\r\nWatheling street to Knightriders street aforesaid, where it endeth. This\r\nBread street is wholly on both sides of this ward. Out of the which\r\nstreet, on the east side, is Basing lane, a piece whereof, to wit, to\r\nand over against the back gate of the Red Lion in Watheling street, is\r\nof this Bread street ward.\r\n\r\nThen is Fryday street beginning also in West Cheap, and runneth down\r\nsouth through Watheling street to Knightriders street, or Old Fish\r\nstreet. This Friday street is of Bread street ward on the east side from\r\nover against the north-east corner of St. Matthew’s church, and on the\r\nwest side from the south corner of the said church, down as aforesaid.\r\n\r\nIn this Fryday street, on the west side thereof, is a lane, commonly\r\ncalled Mayden lane, or Distaffe lane, corruptly for Distar lane, which\r\nrunneth west into the Old Exchange; and in this lane is also one other\r\nlane, on the south side thereof, likewise called Distar lane, which\r\nrunneth down to Knightriders street, or Old Fish street; and so be the\r\nbounds of this whole ward.\r\n\r\nMonuments to be noted here, first at Bread street corner, the north-east\r\nend, 1595, of Thomas Tomlinson, causing in the high street of Cheape a\r\nvault to be digged and made, there was found, at fifteen feet deep, a\r\nfair pavement like unto that above ground, and at the further end at\r\nthe channel was found a tree sawed into five steps, which was to step\r\nover some brook running out of the west towards Walbrooke; and upon the\r\nedge of the said brook, as it seemeth, there were found lying along\r\nthe bodies of two great trees, the ends whereof were then sawed off,\r\nand firm timber as at the first when they fell, part of the said trees\r\nremain yet in the ground undigged. It was all forced ground until they\r\nwent past the trees aforesaid, which was about seventeen feet deep or\r\nbetter; thus much hath the ground of this city in that place been raised\r\nfrom the main.\r\n\r\nNext to be noted, the most beautiful frame of fair houses and shops that\r\nbe within the walls of London, or elsewhere in England, commonly called\r\nGoldsmith’s row, betwixt Bread street end and the cross in Cheape,\r\nbut is within this Bread street ward; the same was built by Thomas\r\nWood, goldsmith, one of the sheriffs of London, in the year 1491. It\r\ncontaineth in number ten fair dwelling-houses and fourteen shops, all\r\nin one frame, uniformly built four stories high, beautified towards the\r\nstreet with the Goldsmiths’ arms and the likeness of woodmen, in memory\r\nof his name, riding on monstrous beasts, all which is cast in lead,\r\nrichly painted over and gilt: these he gave to the Goldsmiths, with\r\nstocks of money, to be lent to young men having those shops, etc. This\r\nsaid front was again new painted and gilt over in the year 1594; Sir\r\nRichard Martin being then mayor, and keeping his mayoralty in one of\r\nthem, serving out the time of Cuthbert Buckle in that office from the\r\n2nd of July till the 28th of October.\r\n\r\nThen for Watheling street, which Leyland called Atheling or Noble\r\nstreet; but since he showeth no reason why, I rather take it to be so\r\nnamed of the great highway of the same calling. True it is, that at\r\nthis present the inhabitants thereof are wealthy drapers, retailers of\r\nwoollen cloths, both broad and narrow, of all sorts, more than in any\r\none street of this city.\r\n\r\nOf the Old Exchange, I have noted in Faringdon ward; wherefore I pass\r\ndown to Knightriders street, whereof I have also spoken in Cordwainers\r\nstreet ward; but in this part of the said Knightriders street is a fish\r\nmarket kept, and therefore called Old Fish street for a difference from\r\nNew Fish street.\r\n\r\nIn this Old Fish street is one row of small houses, placed along in\r\nthe midst of Knightriders street, which row is also of Bread street\r\nward: these houses, now possessed by fishmongers, were at the first but\r\nmoveable boards (or stalls), set out on market-days, to show their fish\r\nthere to be sold; but procuring license to set up sheds, they grew to\r\nshops, and by little and little to tall houses, of three or four stories\r\nin height, and now are called Fish street. Walter Turke, fishmonger,\r\nmayor 1349, had two shops in Old Fish street, over against St. Nicholas\r\nchurch; the one rented five shillings the year, the other four shillings.\r\n\r\nBread street, so called of bread sold there (as I said), is now wholly\r\ninhabited by rich merchants; and divers fair inns be there, for good\r\nreceipt of carriers and other travellers to the city.\r\n\r\nOn the east side of this street, at the corner of Watheling street,\r\nis the proper church of Alhallowes in Bread street, wherein are the\r\nmonuments--of James Thame, goldsmith; John Walpole, goldsmith, 1349;\r\nThomas Beamount, alderman, one of the sheriffs 1442; Robert Basset,\r\nsalter, mayor 1476; Sir Richard Chaury, salter, mayor 1509; Sir Thomas\r\nPargitar, salter, mayor 1530; Henry Sucley, merchant-tailor, one of\r\nthe sheriffs 1541; Richard Reade, alderman, that served and was taken\r\nprisoner in Scotland, 1542; Robert House, one of the sheriffs 1589;\r\nWilliam Albany, Richard May, and Roger Abde, merchant-tailors.\r\n\r\nIn the 23rd of Henry VIII., the 17th of August, two priests of this\r\nchurch fell at variance, that the one drew blood of the other; wherefore\r\nthe same church was suspended, and no service sung or said therein for\r\nthe space of one month after: the priests were committed to prison,\r\nand the 15th of October, being enjoined penance, went before a general\r\nprocession, bare-headed, bare-footed, and bare-legged, before the\r\nchildren, with beads and books in their hands, from Paules, through\r\nCheape, Cornehill, etc.\r\n\r\nMore to be noted of this church, which had sometime a fair spired\r\nsteeple of stone. In the year 1559, the 5th of September, about mid-day,\r\nfell a great tempest of lightning, with a terrible clap of thunder,\r\nwhich struck the said spire about nine or ten feet beneath the top; out\r\nof the which place fell a stone that slew a dog, and overthrew a man\r\nthat was playing with the dog. The same spire being but little damnified\r\nthereby, was shortly after taken down, for sparing the charges of\r\nreparation.\r\n\r\nOn the same side is Salters’ hall, with six alms houses in number, built\r\nfor poor decayed brethren of that company. This hall was burnt in the\r\nyear 1539, and again re-edified.\r\n\r\nLower down on the same side is the parish church of St. Mildred the\r\nVirgin. The monuments in this church be--of the Lord Trenchaunt of\r\nSt. Alban’s, knight, who was supposed to be either the new builder of\r\nthis church, or best benefactor to the works thereof, about the year\r\n1300; and Odde Cornish, gentleman, 1312; William Palmer, blader, a\r\ngreat benefactor also, 1356; John Shadworth, mayor 1401, who gave the\r\nparsonage-house, a re-vestry, and churchyard to that parish, in the\r\nyear 1428; notwithstanding, his monument is pulled down; Stephen Bugge,\r\ngentleman; his arms be three water-bugs,[248] 1419; Henry Bugge founded\r\na chantry there 1419; Roger Forde, vintner, 1440; Thomas Barnwell,\r\nfishmonger, one of the sheriffs 1434; Sir John Hawlen, clerk, parson\r\nof that church, who built the parsonage-house newly after the same had\r\nbeen burnt to the ground, together with the parson and his man also,\r\nburnt in that fire, 1485; John Parnell, 1510; William Hurstwaight,\r\npewterer to the king, 1526; Christopher Turner, chirurgeon to King Henry\r\nVIII., 1530; Ralph Simonds, fishmonger, one of the sheriffs in the year\r\n1527; Thomas Langham gave to the poor of that parish four tenements\r\n1575; Thomas Hall, salter, 1582; Thomas Collins, salter, alderman; Sir\r\nAmbrose Nicholas, salter, mayor 1575, was buried in Sir John Shadworth’s\r\nvault.\r\n\r\nOut of this Bread street, on the same side, is Basing lane; a part\r\nwhereof (as is afore showed) is of this ward, but how it took the name\r\nof Basing I have not read: in the 20th year of Richard II. the same was\r\ncalled the bakehouse, whether meant for the king’s bakehouse, or of\r\nbakers dwelling there, and baking bread to serve the market in Bread\r\nstreet, where the bread was sold, I know not; but sure I am, I have not\r\nread of Basing, or of Gerrarde the giant, to have anything there to do.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of this lane is one great house, of old time built\r\nupon arched vaults, and with arched gates of stone, brought from Caen in\r\nNormandy. The same is now a common hostrey for receipt of travellers,\r\ncommonly and corruptly called Gerrardes hall, of a giant said to have\r\ndwelt there. In the high-roofed hall of this house sometime stood a\r\nlarge fir pole, which reached to the roof thereof, and was said to be\r\none of the staves[249] that Gerrarde the giant used in the wars to\r\nrun withal. There stood also a ladder of the same length, which (as\r\nthey say) served to ascend to the top of the staff. Of later years\r\nthis hall is altered in building, and divers rooms are made in it.\r\nNotwithstanding, the pole is removed to one corner of the hall, and\r\nthe ladder hanged broken upon a wall in the yard. The hostelar of that\r\nhouse said to me, “the pole lacketh half a foot of forty in length:” I\r\nmeasured the compass thereof, and found it fifteen inches. Reason of\r\nthe pole could the master of the hostrey give me none, but bade me read\r\nthe great Chronicles, for there he heard of it: which answer seemed to\r\nme insufficient, for he meant the description of Britaine, for the most\r\npart drawn out of John Leyland his commentaries (borrowed of myself),\r\nand placed before Reyne Wolfe’s Chronicle,[250] as the labours of\r\nanother (who was forced to confess he never travelled further than from\r\nLondon to the university of Oxford): he writing a chapter of giants or\r\nmonstrous men, hath set down more matter than truth, as partly against\r\nmy will I am enforced here to touch. R. G., in his brief collection of\r\nhistories (as he termeth it) hath these words: “I, the writer hereof,\r\ndid see, the 10th day of March, in the yeare of our Lord 1564, and had\r\nthe same in my hand, the tooth of a man, which weighed ten ounces of\r\ntroy weight; and the skull of the same man is extant, and to be seene,\r\nwhich will hold five pecks of wheat; and the shin-bone of the same man\r\nis six foote in length, and of a marvellous greatness.” Thus far of\r\nR. G.[251] The error thereof is thus: He affirmeth a stone to be the\r\ntooth of a man, which stone (so proved) having no shape of a tooth, had\r\nneither skull or shin-bone. Notwithstanding, it is added in the said\r\ndescription, that by conjectural symetry of those parts the body to be\r\ntwenty-eight feet long, or more. From this he goeth to another like\r\nmatter, of a man with a mouth sixteen feet wide, and so to Gerrard the\r\ngiant and his staff. But to leave these fables, and return where I left,\r\nI will note what myself hath observed concerning that house.\r\n\r\nI read that John Gisors, mayor of London in the year 1245, was owner\r\nthereof, and that Sir John Gisors, knight, mayor of London, and\r\nconstable of the Tower 1311, and divers others of that name and family,\r\nsince that time owned it. William Gisors was one of the sheriffs 1329.\r\nMore, John Gisors had issue, Henry and John; which John had issue,\r\nThomas; which Thomas deceasing in the year 1350, left unto his son\r\nThomas his messuage called Gisor’s hall, in the parish of St. Mildred\r\nin Bread street; John Gisors made a feoffment thereof, 1386, etc. So\r\nit appeareth that this Gisor’s hall, of late time by corruption hath\r\nbeen called Gerrard’s hall[252] for Gisor’s hall; as Bosom’s inn for\r\nBlossom’s inn, Bevis marks for Buries marks, Marke lane for Marte lane,\r\nBelliter lane for Belsetter’s lane, Gutter lane for Guthuruns lane, Cry\r\nchurch for Christ’s church, St. Mihel in the quorn for St. Mihel at\r\ncorne, and sundry such others. Out of this Gisor’s hall, at the first\r\nbuilding thereof, were made divers arched doors, yet to be seen, which\r\nseem not sufficient for any great monster, or other than man of common\r\nstature to pass through, the pole in the hall might be used of old time\r\n(as then the custom was in every parish), to be set up in the summer\r\nas May-pole, before the principal house in the parish or street, and\r\nto stand in the hall before the screen, decked with holme and ivy, all\r\nthe feast of Christmas.[253] The ladder served for the decking of the\r\nmay-pole and roof of the hall. Thus much for Gisor’s hall, and for that\r\nside of Bread street, may suffice.\r\n\r\nNow on the west side of Bread street, amongst divers fair and large\r\nhouses for merchants, and fair inns for passengers, had ye one\r\nprison-house pertaining to the sheriffs of London, called the compter\r\nin Bread street; but in the year 1555 the prisoners were removed\r\nfrom thence to one other new compter in Wood street, provided by\r\nthe city’s purchase, and built for that purpose; the cause of which\r\nremove was this: Richard Husband, pastelar, keeper of this compter\r\nin Bread street, being a wilful and head-strong man, dealt, for his\r\nown advantage, hard with the prisoners under his charge, having also\r\nservants such as himself liked best for their bad usage, and would not\r\nfor any complaint be reformed; whereupon, in the year 1550, Sir Rowland\r\nHill being mayor, by the assent of a court of aldermen, he was sent to\r\nthe gaol of Newgate, for the cruel handling of his prisoners; and it\r\nwas commanded to the keeper to set those irons on his legs which are\r\ncalled the widow’s alms. These he ware from Thursday to Sunday in the\r\nafternoon, and being by a court of aldermen released on the Tuesday,\r\nwas bound in a hundred marks to observe from thenceforth an act made\r\nby the common council, for the ordering of prisoners in the compters;\r\nall which notwithstanding, he continued as afore, whereof myself am\r\npartly a witness; for being of a jury to inquire against a sessions of\r\ngaol delivery,[254] in the year 1552, we found the prisoners hardly\r\ndealt withal, for their achates and otherwise; as also that thieves\r\nand strumpets were there lodged for four pence the night, whereby\r\nthey might be safe from searches that were made abroad; for the which\r\nenormities, and other not needful to be recited, he was indighted at\r\nthat session, but did rub it out, and could not be reformed till this\r\nremove of prisoners, for the house in Bread street was his own by lease,\r\nor otherwise, so that he could not be put from it. Note, that gaolers\r\nbuying their offices will deal hardly with pitiful prisoners.\r\n\r\nNow in Friday street, so called of fishmongers dwelling there, and\r\nserving Friday’s market, on the east side, is a small parish church,\r\ncommonly called St. John Evangelist: the monuments therein be of John\r\nDogget, merchant tailor, one of the sheriffs in the year 1509; Sir\r\nChristopher Askew, draper, mayor 1533; William de Avinger, farrier, was\r\nburied there in the 34th of Edward III. Then lower down, is one other\r\nparish church of St. Margaret Moyses, so called (as seemeth) of one\r\nMoyses, that was founder or new builder thereof. The monuments there be\r\nof Sir Richard Dobbes, skinner, mayor 1551; William Dane, ironmonger,\r\none of the sheriffs 1569; Sir John Allet, fishmonger, mayor 1591. There\r\nwas of older time buried, Nicholas Stanes, and Nicholas Braye; they\r\nfounded chantries there.\r\n\r\nOn the west side of this Friday street, is Mayden lane, so named of\r\nsuch a sign, or Distaffe lane, for Distar lane, as I read in the record\r\nof a brewhouse called the Lamb, in Distar lane, the 16th of Henry VI.\r\nIn this Distar lane, on the north side thereof, is the Cordwainers, or\r\nShoemakers’ hall, which company were made a brotherhood or fraternity,\r\nin the 11th of Henry IV. Of these cordwainers I read, that since the\r\nfifth of Richard II. (when he took to wife Anne, daughter to Vesalaus,\r\nKing of Boheme), by her example, the English people had used piked\r\nshoes, tied to their knees with silken laces, or chains of silver or\r\ngilt, wherefore in the 4th of Edward IV. it was ordained and proclaimed,\r\nthat beaks of shoone and boots, should not pass the length of two\r\ninches, upon pain of cursing by the clergy, and by parliament to pay\r\ntwenty shillings for every pair. And every cordwainer that shod any man\r\nor woman on the Sunday, to pay thirty shillings.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of this Distar lane, is also one other lane, called\r\nDistar lane, which runneth down to Knightriders’ street, or Old Fish\r\nstreet, and this is the end of Bread street ward; which hath an\r\nalderman, his deputy, common council ten, constables ten, scavengers\r\neight, wardmote inquest thirteen, and a beadle. It standeth taxed to the\r\nfifteen in London, at £37, and in the Exchequer at £36 18_s._ 2_d._[255]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[247] “In London at fifty-four pounds, and in the Exchequer at\r\nfifty-three pounds six shillings and eight pence.”--_1st edition_, p.\r\n345.\r\n\r\n[248] Water Bougets--heraldic representations of the leathern bottles in\r\nwhich water was anciently carried.\r\n\r\n[249] “A pole of forty foote long, and fifteen inches about, fabuled to\r\nbe the iusting staffe of Gerrard a giant.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\n[250] “Which aunswere seemed to me insufficient, for hee meant the\r\ndescription of Brittaine, before Reinwolfe’s Chronicle, wherein the\r\nauthor writing a chapter of Gyaunts, and having been deceived by some\r\nauthours, too much crediting their smoothe speeche, hath set down more\r\nmatter than troth, as partly (and also against my will) I am enforced to\r\ntouch.”--_1st edition_, p. 283.\r\n\r\n[251] “R.

They indighted the bowling alleys,\r\netc.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUEENE HITHE WARD\r\n\r\n\r\nNext unto Bread street ward, on the south side thereof, is Queene Hithe\r\nward, so called of a water gate, or harbour for boats, lighters, and\r\nbarges; and was of old time for ships, at what time the timber bridge of\r\nLondon was drawn up, for the passage of them to the said hithe, as to a\r\nprincipal strand for landing and unlading against the midst and heart of\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nThis ward beginneth in the east, in Knightriders’ street, on the south\r\nside thereof, at the east end of the parish church called the Holy\r\nTrinity, and runneth west on the south side to a lane called Lambert\r\nhill, which is the length of the ward in Knightriders’ street, out of\r\nthe which street are divers lanes, running south to Thames street, and\r\nare of this ward: the first is Trinity lane, which runneth down by the\r\nwest end of Trinity church; then is Spuren lane, or Spooner’s lane, now\r\ncalled Huggen lane; then Bread street hill; then St. Mary Mounthaunt,\r\nout of the which lane, on the east side thereof, is one other lane,\r\nturning east, through St. Nicholas Olave’s churchyard to Bread street\r\nhill. This lane is called Finimore lane, or Fivefoot lane, because it\r\nis but five feet in breadth at the west end; in the midst of this lane\r\nrunneth down one other lane broader, south to Thames street, I think\r\nthe same to be called Desbourne lane, for I read of such a lane to have\r\nbeen in the parish of Mary Summerset, in the 22nd year of Edward III.,\r\nwhere there is said to lie between the tenement of Edward de Montacute,\r\nknight, on the east part, and the tenement some time pertaining to\r\nWilliam Gladwine on the west, one plot of ground, containing in length\r\ntowards Thames street, twenty-five feet, etc.\r\n\r\nLast of all, have you Lambart-hill lane, so called of one Lambart, owner\r\nthereof; and this is the furthest west part of this ward.\r\n\r\nOn the north side coming down from Knightriders’ street, the east side\r\nof Lambart hill, is wholly of this ward; and the west side, from the\r\nnorth end of the Blackesmiths’ hall (which is about the midst of this\r\nlane) unto Thames street; then part of Thames street is also of this\r\nward, to wit, from a cook’s house called the sign of King David, three\r\nhouses west from the Old Swan brewhouse in the east, unto Huntington\r\nhouse, over against St. Peter’s church in the west, near unto Paul’s\r\nwharf; and on the land side, from a cook’s house called the Blue Boar,\r\nto the west end of St. Peter’s church, and up St. Peter’s hill, two\r\nhouses north above the said church. And these be the bounds of this\r\nward, in which are parish churches seven, halls of companies two, and\r\nother ornaments as shall be shewed.\r\n\r\nFirst in Knightriders’ street, is the small parish church of the Holy\r\nTrinity, very old, and in danger of down falling: collections have been\r\nmade for repairing thereof, but they will not stretch so far, and,\r\ntherefore, it leaneth upon props or stilts. Monuments as followeth.\r\n\r\nJohn Brian, alderman in the reign of Henry V., a great benefactor; John\r\nChamber had a chantry there; Thomas Rishby, esquire, and Alice his wife,\r\nwithin the chancel; John Mirfin, auditor of the exchequer 1471; Sir\r\nRichard Fowler, of Ricks in Oxfordshire, 1528; George Cope, second son\r\nto Sir John Cope of Copasashby in Northamptonshire, 1572.\r\n\r\nTowards the west end of Knightriders’ street is the parish church of St.\r\nNicolas Cold Abbey, a proper church, somewhat ancient, as appeareth by\r\nthe ways raised thereabout, so that men are forced to descend into the\r\nbody of the church: it hath been called of many Golden Abbey, of some,\r\nGold Abbey, or Cold Bey, and so hath the most ancient writings,[256] as\r\nstanding in a cold place, as Cold harbour, and such like. The steeple or\r\ntall tower of this church, with the south aisle, have been of a later\r\nbuilding: to wit, the 1st of Richard II., when it was meant the whole\r\nold church should have been new built, as appeareth by the arching begun\r\non the east side the steeple, under the which, in the stone work, the\r\narms of one Buckland, esquire, and his wife, daughter to Beaupere, are\r\ncut in stone, and also are in the glass windows, whereby it appeareth\r\nhe was the builder of the steeple, and repairer of the residue. The\r\n26th of Edward III., An. Aubrey being mayor,[257] T. Frere, fishmonger,\r\ngave one piece of ground to the said parish church of St. Nicholas,\r\ncontaining eighty-six feet in length, and forty-three feet at one end,\r\nand thirty-four at the other, in breadth, for a cemetery or churchyard.\r\nThe 20th of Richard II., Thomas Barnard Castle, clerke, John Sonderash,\r\nclerke, and John Nouncy, gave to the parson and churchwardens of the\r\nsaid church and their successors, one messuage and one shop, with the\r\nappurtenances, in Distaffe lane and Old Fish street, for the reparation\r\nof the body of the said church, the belfry or steeple, and ornaments.\r\n\r\nBuried in this church, John Calfe, and William Cogeshall, 1426; Waltar\r\nTurke, fishmonger, mayor 1349; Richarde Esastone, fishmonger, 1330;\r\nNicholas Wolberge, fishmonger, 1407; Thomas Paddington, fishmonger,\r\n1485; Robert Hary, fishmonger, John Suring, 1490; Roger Darlington,\r\nfishmonger, 1557; Richard Lacty, parson, under a fair tomb on the\r\nnorth side the choir, 1491; Richard Bradbrudge, 1497; William Clarke,\r\n1501; James Picman, 1507; Richard Farneford, 1525; Thomas Nicholas,\r\nfishmonger, 1527; William Barde, fishmonger, 1528.\r\n\r\nOn the north side of this church, in the wall thereof, was of late built\r\na convenient cistern of stone and lead, for receipt of Thames water,\r\nconveyed in pipes of lead to that place, for the ease and commodity of\r\nthe fishmongers and other inhabitants in and about Old Fish street.\r\nBarnard Randolph, common serjeant of the city of London, did in his\r\nlifetime deliver to the company of Fishmongers the sum of nine hundred\r\npounds, to be employed towards the conducting of the said Thames water,\r\nand cisterning the same, etc.; in the parishes of St. Mary Magdalen, and\r\nSt. Nicholas Colde Abbey, near unto Fish street, seven hundred pounds;\r\nand other two hundred pounds to charitable deeds: he deceased 1583, and\r\nshortly after this conduit with the other was made and finished.\r\n\r\nIn Trinity lane, on the west side thereof, is the Painterstainers’\r\nhall, for so of old time were they called, but now that workmanship of\r\nstaining is departed out of use in England. Lower down in Trinity lane,\r\non the east side thereof, was sometime a great messuage pertaining unto\r\nJohn, earl of Cornwall, in the 14th of Edward III. On Bread street hill,\r\ndown to the Thames on both sides, be divers fair houses, inhabited\r\nby fishmongers, cheesemongers, and merchants of divers trades. On\r\nthe west side whereof is the parish church of St. Nicholas Olive, a\r\nconvenient church, having the monuments of W. Newport, fishmonger, one\r\nof the sheriffs 1375; Richard Willowes, parson, 1391; Richard Sturges,\r\nfishmonger, 1470; Thomas Lewen, ironmonger, one of the sheriffs 1537,\r\nwho gave his messuage, with the appurtenances, wherein he dwelt, with\r\nfourteen tenements in the said parish of St. Nicholas, to be had\r\nafter the decease of Agnes his wife, to the ironmongers, and they to\r\ngive stipends appointed to almsmen, in five houses by them built in\r\nthe churchyard of that parish, more to poor scholars in Oxford and\r\nCambridge, etc. Blitheman, an excellent organist of the Queen’s chapel,\r\nlieth buried there with an epitaph, 1591, etc.\r\n\r\nThe next is Old Fishstreet hill, a lane so called, which also runneth\r\ndown to Thames street. In this lane, on the east side thereof, is the\r\none end of Finimore, or Five foot lane. On the west side of this Old\r\nFishstreet hill is the Bishop of Hereford’s inn or lodging, an ancient\r\nhouse and large rooms, built of stone and timber, which sometime\r\nbelonged to the Mounthauntes in Norfolk. Radulphus de Maydenstone,\r\nBishop of Hereford, about 1234, bought it of the Mounthauntes, and gave\r\nit to the Bishops of Hereford, his successors. Charles, both Bishop of\r\nHereford and Chancellor of the Marches, about the year 1517, repaired\r\nit, since the which time the same is greatly ruinated, and is now\r\ndivided into many small tenements; the hall and principal rooms, are a\r\nhouse to make sugar-loaves, etc.\r\n\r\nNext adjoining is the parish church of St. Mary de Monte Alto, or\r\nMounthaunt; this is a very small church, and at the first built to\r\nbe a chapel for the said house of the Mounthaunts, and for tenements\r\nthereunto belonging. The Bishop of Hereford is patron thereof. Monuments\r\nin this church of John Glocester, alderman 1345, who gave Salt wharf\r\nfor two chantries there; John Skip, Bishop of Hereford, 1539, sate\r\ntwelve years, died at London in time of parliament, and was buried in\r\nthis church. There was sometime a fair house in the said parish of\r\nSt. Mary Mounthaunt, belonging to Robert Belkenape, one of the king’s\r\njustices, but the said Belkenape being banished this realm. King Richard\r\nII. in the twelfth of his reign, gave it to William Wickham, Bishop of\r\nWinchester.\r\n\r\nOn the east side of this Old Fishstreet hill, is one great house, now\r\nlet out for rent, which house sometime was one of the halls, pertaining\r\nto the company of Fishmongers, at such time as they had six hallmotes or\r\nmeeting places: namely, two in Bridge street, or New Fish street; two in\r\nOld Fish street, whereof this was one; and two in Stockfishmonger row,\r\nor Thames street, as appeareth by a record, the 22nd of Richard II.\r\n\r\nNext westward is one other lane called Lambard hill, the east side\r\nwhereof is wholly of this ward, and but half the west side, to wit, from\r\nthe north end of the Blacksmiths’ hall.\r\n\r\nThen in Thames street of this ward, and on the north side over against\r\nthe Queen’s hith, is the parish church of St. Michaell, a convenient\r\nchurch, but all the monuments therein are defaced.\r\n\r\nI find that Stephen Spilman, gentleman, of that family in Norfolk,\r\nsometime mercer, chamberlain of London, then one of the sheriffs, and\r\nalderman in the year 1404, deceasing without issue, gave his lands to\r\nhis family the Spilmans, and his goods to the making or repairing of\r\nbridges and other like godly uses; and amongst others in this church he\r\nfounded a chantry, and was buried in the choir.\r\n\r\nAlso Richard Marlowe, ironmonger, mayor 1409, gave twenty pounds to the\r\npoor of that ward, and ten marks to the church.\r\n\r\nRichard Gray, ironmonger, one of the sheriffs 1515, gave forty pounds to\r\nthat church, and was buried there. At the west end of that church goeth\r\nup a lane, called Pyel lane. On the same north side, at the south end of\r\nSt. Mary Mounthaunt lane, is the parish church of St. Mary Summerset,\r\nover against the Broken wharf; it is a proper church, but the monuments\r\nare all defaced. I think the same to be of old time called Summer’s\r\nhith, of some man’s name that was owner of the ground near adjoining, as\r\nEdred’s hithe was so called of Edred owner thereof, and thence called\r\nQueene hithe, as pertaining to the queen, etc.\r\n\r\nThen is a small parish church of St. Peter, called _parva_, or little,\r\nnear unto Powle’s wharf; in this church no monuments do remain. At the\r\nwest end thereof, is a lane called St. Peter’s hill, but two houses up\r\nthat lane on the east side is of this ward, and the rest is of Castle\r\nBaynarde ward.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of Thames street, beginning again in the east, among\r\nthe cooks, the first in this ward, is the sign of David the King; then\r\nis Towne’s end lane, turning down to the Thames; then is Queene hithe, a\r\nlarge receptacle for ships, lighters, barges, and such other vessels.\r\n\r\nTouching the antiquity and use of this gate and hithe, first, I find\r\nthe same belongeth to one named Edred, and was then called Edred’s\r\nhithe, which since falling to the hands of King Stephen, it was by his\r\ncharter confirmed to William De Ypre;[258] the farm thereof in fee and\r\nin heritage, William De Ypre gave unto the prior and convent of the Holy\r\nTrinity within Aldgate, as appeareth by this charter:--\r\n\r\n“To Theobalde, by the grace of God, Archbishop of Canterbury, primate of\r\nEngland, and Legate Apostolike, to the Bishoppe of London, and to all\r\nfaithful people, clarkes and layemen, William de Ypre sendeth greeting.\r\n\r\n“Know ye me to have given and graunted to God, and to the church of\r\nthe Holy Trinitie of London, to the prior and canons there serving\r\nGod in perpetuall almes, Edred’s hith, with the appurtenances, with\r\nsuch devotion, that they shall send every yeare twentie pound unto the\r\nmaintenance of the hospital of St. Katherens, which hospitall they have\r\nin their hands, and one hundred shillinges to the monkes of Bermondsey,\r\nand sixty shillinges to the brethren of the hospitall of St. Giles,\r\nand that which remayneth, the said prior and canons shall enjoy to\r\nthemselves. Witnesses, Richard de Lucie, Raph Picot, etc.”\r\n\r\nThis Edred’s hithe, after the aforesaid grants, came again to the king’s\r\nhands, by what means I have not read, but it pertained unto the queen,\r\nand, therefore, was called _Ripa reginæ_, the Queene’s bank, or Queen’s\r\nhithe, and great profit thereof was made to her use, as may appear by\r\nthis which followeth.\r\n\r\nKing Henry III. in the 9th of his reign, commanded the constables of the\r\nTower of London to arrest the ships of the Cinque Ports on the river of\r\nThames, and to compel them to bring their corne to no other place, but\r\nto the Queen’s hithe only. In the eleventh of his reign, he charged the\r\nsaid constable to distrain all fish offered to be sold in any place of\r\nthis city, but at the Queene hithe. Moreover, in the 28th of the said\r\nking’s reign, an inquisition was made before William of Yorke, provost\r\nof Beverley, Henry of Bath, and Hierome of Caxton, justices itinerant,\r\nsitting in the Tower of London, touching the customs of Queen hithe,\r\nobserved in the year last before the wars between the king and his\r\nfather, and the barons of England, and of old customs of other times,\r\nand what customs had been changed, at what time the tax and payment of\r\nall things coming together, and between Woore path and Anedehithe,[259]\r\nwere found and ceased, according to the old order, as well corn and fish\r\nas other things: all which customs were as well to be observed in the\r\npart of Downegate, as in Queen hithe, for the king’s use. When also it\r\nwas found that the corn arriving between the gate of the Guildhall of\r\nthe merchants of Cologne, and the soke of the Archbishop of Canterbury\r\n(for he had a house near unto the Blacke Fryers), was not to be measured\r\nby any other quarter, than by that of the Queene’s soke.\r\n\r\nAfter this, the bailiff of the said hithe complained that, since the\r\nsaid recognition, fourteen foreign ships laden with fish, arrived at\r\nBelinge’s gate, which ships should have arrived at the same hithe;\r\nand, therefore, it was ordered, that if any foreign ship laden with\r\nfish, should in form aforesaid, arrive elsewhere than at this hithe,\r\nit should be at the king’s pleasure to amerce them at forty shillings.\r\nNotwithstanding, the ships of the citizens of London were at liberty to\r\narrive where the owners would appoint them.\r\n\r\nAfter this, the said Henry III. confirmed the grant of Richard Earl of\r\nCornwall for the farm of the Queen hithe unto John Gisors, then mayor,\r\nand to the commonalty of London, and their successors for ever, as by\r\nthis his charter appeareth:\r\n\r\n“Henry, by the grace of God, King of England, Lord of Ireland, Duke of\r\nGuien, and Earl of Anjou, to all archbishops, etc. Be it known, that we\r\nhave seen the covenant between our brother, Richard Earl of Cornwall,\r\non the one part, and the mayor and commonalty on the other part, which\r\nwas in this sort. In the 30th year of Henry, the son of King John,[260]\r\nupon the feast of the Translation of St. Edward, at Westminster, this\r\ncovenant was made between the honourable Lord Richard Earl of Cornwall,\r\nand John Gisors, then mayor of London, and the commons thereof,\r\nconcerning certain exactions and demands pertaining to the Queen hithe\r\nof London. The said earl granted for himself and his heirs, that the\r\nsaid mayor, and all mayors ensuing, and all the commons of the city,\r\nshould have and hold the Queen hithe, with all the liberties, customs,\r\nand other appurtenances, repaying yearly to the said earl, his heirs and\r\nassigns, fifty pounds, at Clarkenwell, at two several terms; to wit, the\r\nSunday after Easter twenty-five pounds, and at Michaelmas twenty-five\r\npounds. And for more surety hereof the said earl hath set thereunto his\r\nseal, and left it with the mayor, and the mayor and commonalty have\r\nset to their seal, and left it with the earl. Wherefore we confirm and\r\nestablish the said covenant for us, and for our heirs. Witnesses, Raph\r\nFitz Nichol, Richard Gray, John and Wil. Brithem, Paulin Painter, Raph\r\nWancia, John Cumbaud, and other, at Windsor, 26th of February, in the\r\n31st of our reign.”\r\n\r\nThe charge of this Queen hithe was then committed to the sheriffs, and\r\nso hath continued ever since; the profits whereof are sore diminished,\r\nso that (as writeth Robert Fabian) it was worth in his time little above\r\ntwenty marks, or fifteen pounds, one year with another. Now for customs\r\nof this Queen hithe.[261] In the year 1302, the 30th of Edward I., it\r\nwas found by the oath of divers men, that bakers, brewers, and others,\r\nbuying their corn at Queen hithe, should pay for measuring, portage,\r\nand carriage, for every quarter of corn whatsoever, from thence to West\r\nCheap, to St. Anthonie’s church, to Horshew bridge, and to Woolsey\r\nstreet, in the parish of Allhallowes the Less, and such like distances,\r\none halfpenny farthing; to Fleet bridge, to Newgate, Cripplegate, to\r\nBircheovers lane, to Eastcheape, and Billingsgate, one penny. Also, that\r\nthe measure (or the meter) ought to have eight chief master-porters,\r\nevery master to have three porters under him, and every one of them\r\nto find one horse, and seven sacks; and he that so did not, to lose\r\nhis office. This hithe was then so frequented with vessels, bringing\r\nthither corn (besides fish, salt, fuel, and other merchandises), that\r\nall these men, to wit, the meter, and porters, thirty-seven in number,\r\nfor all their charges of horses and sacks, and small stipend, lived well\r\nof their labours; but now[262] the bakers of London, and other citizens,\r\ntravel into the countries, and buy their corn of the farmers, after the\r\nfarmers’ price.\r\n\r\nKing Edward II., in the 1st of his reign, gave to Margaret, wife to\r\nPiers de Gavestone, forty-three pounds twelve shillings and nine pence\r\nhalfpenny farthing, out of the rent of London, to be received of the\r\nQueen’s hithe. Certain impositions were set upon ships and other vessels\r\ncoming thither, as upon corn, salt, and other things, toward the charge\r\nof cleansing Roome-land there, the 41st of Edward III.\r\n\r\nThe 3rd of Edward IV., the market at Queen hithe being hindered by the\r\nslackness of drawing up London bridge, it was ordained, that all manner\r\nof vessels, ships, or boats, great or small, resorting to the city with\r\nvictual, should be sold by retail; and that if there came but one vessel\r\nat a time, were it salt, wheat, rye, or other corn, from beyond the\r\nseas, or other grains, garlic, onions, herrings, sprats, eels, whiting,\r\nplaice, cods, mackarel, etc., then that one vessel should come to Queen\r\nhithe, and there to make sale; but if two vessels come, the one should\r\ncome to Queen hithe, the other to Billingsgate; if three, two of them\r\nshould come to Queen hithe, the third to Billingsgate, etc., always the\r\nmore to Queen hithe; if the vessel being great, coming with salt from\r\nthe Bay, and could not come to these keys, then the same to be conveyed\r\nby lighters, as before is meant.\r\n\r\nOne large house for stowage of corn craned out of lighters and barges,\r\nis there lately built; Sir John Lion, grocer, mayor 1554, by his\r\ntestament, gave a hundred pounds towards it; but since increased and\r\nmade larger at the charges of the city, in the year 1565.\r\n\r\nAgainst this Queen’s hithe, on the river Thames, of late years, was\r\nplaced a corn mill, upon or betwixt two barges or lighters, and there\r\nground corn, as water mills in other places, to the wonder of many that\r\nhad not seen the like; but this lasted not long without decay, such as\r\ncaused the same barges and mill to be removed, taken asunder, and soon\r\nforgotten. I read of the like to have been in former time, as thus:--In\r\nthe year 1525, the 16th of Henry VIII., Sir William Bayly being mayor,\r\nJohn Cooke of Glocester, mercer, gave to the mayor and commonalty of\r\nLondon, and theirs for ever, one great barge, in the which two corn\r\nmills were made and placed, which barge and mills were set in and upon\r\nthe stream of the river of Thames, within the jurisdiction and liberty\r\nof the said city of London.\r\n\r\nAnd also he gave to the city all such timber, boards, stones, iron,\r\netc., provided for making, mending, and repairing of the said barge and\r\nmills, in reward whereof the mayor gave him fifty pounds presently, and\r\nfifty pounds yearly during his life; and if the said Cooke deceased\r\nbefore Johan his wife, then she to have forty marks the year during her\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nNext adjoining to this Queen hithe, on the west side thereof, is Salt\r\nwharf, named of salt taken up, measured, and sold there. The next is\r\nStew lane, of a stew or hothouse there kept. After that is Timber hithe,\r\nor Timber street, so called of timber or boards there taken up and\r\nwharfed; it is in the parish of St. Mary Somershithe, as I read in the\r\n56th of Henry III., and in the 9th of Edward II. Then is Brookes wharf,\r\nand Broken wharf, a water gate or key, so called of being broken and\r\nfallen down into the Thames. By this Broken wharf remaineth one large\r\nold building of stone, with arched gates, which messuage, as I find,\r\nin the reign of Henry III., the 43rd year, pertaining unto Hugh de\r\nBygot; and in the 11th of Edward III., to Thomas Brotherton, the king’s\r\nbrother, Earl of Norfolk, Marshal of England; in the 11th of Henry VI.\r\nto John Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, etc.\r\n\r\nWithin the gate of this house (now belonging to the city of London)\r\nis lately, to wit, in the years 1594 and 1595, built one large house\r\nof great height, called an engine, made by Bevis Bulmar, gentleman,\r\nfor the conveying and forcing of Thames water to serve in the middle\r\nand west parts of the city. The ancient great hall of this messuage\r\nis yet standing, and pertaining to a great brewhouse for beer. West\r\nfrom this is Trigge lane, going down to Thames. Next is called Bosse\r\nlane, of a bosse of water, like unto that of Billingsgate, there placed\r\nby the executors of Richard Whittington. Then is one great messuage,\r\nsometime belonging to the abbots of Chertsey in Surrey, and was their\r\ninn, wherein they were lodged when they repaired to the city; it is now\r\ncalled Sandie house, by what reason I have not heard: I think the Lord\r\nSands have been lodged there.\r\n\r\nAnd this is an end of this Queen hithe ward; which hath an alderman and\r\nhis deputy, common council six, constables nine, scavengers eight,\r\nwardmote inquest thirteen, and a beadle. It is taxed to the fifteen in\r\nLondon twenty pounds, and in the Exchequer at nineteen pounds sixteen\r\nshillings and two pence.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[255] “In the Exchequer thirty-six pounds, ten shillings.”--_1st\r\nedition_, p. 285.\r\n\r\n[256] “But I could never learne the cause why it should be so called,\r\nand therefore I will let it passe.”--_1st edition_, p. 287.\r\n\r\n[257] “There bee monumentes in this church of Andrew Awbery, grocer,\r\nmayor, and Thomas Fryar, fishmonger, in the yeare 1351, who gave to this\r\nchurch and parish one plot of ground, containing fiftie-six foote in\r\nlength, and fortie-three foote in breadth at both endes, to be a buriall\r\nplace for the dead of the said parish, the twenty-sixt of Edward the\r\nthird. Also Thomas Madefry, clarke, and John Pylot, gave to the wardens\r\nof that parish one shop and a house in Distar lane, for the continual\r\nrepairing of the body of that church, the belles and ornaments, the\r\ntwentieth of Richard II.”--_1st edition_, p. 287.\r\n\r\n[258] Liber Trinitate.\r\n\r\n[259] It appears from Strype’s _Stow_ (i. p, 214, ed. 1720), that “Were\r\npath or Wore path, is in the east part of the Flete of Barking, about\r\nseven miles from London; and Anedeheth is near Westminster, on the west\r\npart of London.”\r\n\r\n[260] Liber Trinitate, Lon.\r\n\r\n[261] Liber Constitut.\r\n\r\n[262] “But now that case is altered.”--_1st edition_, p. 293.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTLE BAYNARD WARD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next is Castle Baynard ward, so named of an old castle there.\r\nThis ward beginneth in the east on the Thames side, at a house called\r\nHuntingdon house, and runneth west by Paule’s wharf, by Baynard’s\r\ncastle, Puddle wharf, and by the south side of Black Friers. Then\r\nturning by the east wall of the said Friers to the south-west end of\r\nCreed lane. Then, on the north side of Thames street, over against\r\nHuntington house, by St. Peter’s church and lane, called Peter hill,\r\nalong till over against Puddle wharf, and then north up by the great\r\nWardrobe to the west end of Carter lane, then up Creed lane, Ave Mary\r\nlane, and a piece of Pater Noster row, to the sign of the Golden Lion,\r\nand back again up Warwicke lane, and all the east side thereof, to the\r\nsign of the Crown by Newgate market; and this is the farthest north part\r\nof this ward.\r\n\r\nThen out of Thames street be lanes ascending north to Knightriders\r\nstreet; the first is Peter hill lane, all of that ward (two houses\r\nexcepted, adjoining to St. Peter’s church). The next is Paule’s wharf\r\nhill, which thwarting Knightriders street and Carter lane, goeth up to\r\nthe south chain of Paule’s churchyard.\r\n\r\nThen in Adle street, over against the west part of Baynard’s castle,\r\ngoing up by the west end of Knightriders street and to Carter lane. Thus\r\nmuch for lanes out of Thames street. The one half of the west side of\r\nLambard hill lane being of this ward, at the north-west end thereof, on\r\nthe south side, and at the west end of St. Mary Magdalen’s church on the\r\nnorth side beginneth Knightriders street to be of this ward, and runneth\r\nwest on both sides to the parish church of St. Andrew by the Wardrobe.\r\n\r\nThen at the end of St. Mary Magdalen’s church goeth up the Old Exchange,\r\nall the west side whereof up to the south-east gate of Paule’s\r\nchurchyard, and by St. Austen’s church, is of this ward. About the midst\r\nof this Old Exchange, on the west side thereof is Carter lane, which\r\nrunneth west to the east entry of the Blacke Friers, and to the south\r\nend of Creed lane, out of the which Carter lane descendeth a lane called\r\nDo-little lane, and cometh into Knightriders street by the Boar’s head\r\ntavern; and more west is Sermon lane, by an inn called the Paule head.\r\nThen out of Carter lane, on the north side thereof, the south chain\r\nof Paules churchyard, and the churchyard itself on that south side of\r\nPaules church, and the church of St. Gregorie, the bishop’s palace,\r\nand the dean’s lodging, be all of this ward; and such be the bounds\r\nthereof. The ornaments in this ward be parish churches four. Of old time\r\na castle, divers noblemen’s houses, halls of companies twain, and such\r\nothers, as shall be shown.\r\n\r\nIn Thames street, at the south-east end, is an ancient messuage, of old\r\ntime called Beaumount’s inn, as belonging to that family of noblemen\r\nof this realm in the 4th of Edward III. Edward IV., in the 5th of his\r\nreign, gave it to W. Hastings, lord chamberlain, master of his mints. It\r\nis now called Huntington house, as belonging to the earls of Huntington.\r\nNext is Paul’s wharf, a large landing place, with a common stair upon\r\nthe river of Thames, at the end of a street called Paule’s wharf hill,\r\nwhich runneth down from Paule’s chain. Next is a great messuage, called\r\nScropes inn, sometime belonging to Scropes, in the 31st of Henry VI.\r\n\r\nThen is one other great messuage, sometime belonging to the abbey of\r\nFiscampe, beyond the sea, and by reason of the wars, it coming to the\r\nhands of King Edward III., the same was given to Sir Simon Burley,\r\nknight of the Garter, and, therefore, called Burley house in Thames\r\nstreet, between Baynard’s castle and Paule’s wharf.\r\n\r\nThen have you Baynard’s castle, whereof this whole ward taketh the\r\nname. This castle banketh on the river Thames, and was called Baynard’s\r\ncastle, of Baynard, a nobleman that came in with William the Conqueror,\r\nof the which castle, and of Baynard himself, I have spoken in another\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThere was also another tower by Baynard’s castle, built by King Edward\r\nII. Edward III., in the 2nd of his reign, gave it to William Duke of\r\nHamelake, in the county of York, and his heirs, for one rose yearly, to\r\nbe paid for all service, the same place (as seemeth to me) was since\r\ncalled Legate’s inn, in the 7th of Edward IV., where be now divers wood\r\nwharfs in place.\r\n\r\nThen is there a great brewhouse, and Puddle wharf, a watergate into the\r\nThames, where horses use to water, and therefore being defiled with\r\ntheir trampling, and made puddle, like as also of one Puddle dwelling\r\nthere, it is called Puddle wharf. Then is there a lane between the\r\nBlacke Fryers and the Thames, called in the 26th of Edward III. Castle\r\nlane.\r\n\r\nIn this lane also is one great messuage, of old time belonging to the\r\npriory of Okeborne in Wiltshire, and was the prior’s lodging when\r\nhe repaired to London. This priory being of the French order, was\r\nsuppressed by Henry V., and with other lands and tenements pertaining\r\nto the said priory, was by Henry VI. given to his college in Cambridge,\r\ncalled now the King’s college. About this castle lane was sometime a\r\nmill or mills belonging to the Templars of the New Temple, as appeareth\r\nof record; for King John, in the 1st year of his reign, granted a place\r\nin the Fleet, near unto Baynard’s castle, to make a mill, and the whole\r\ncourse of water of the Fleet to serve the said mill.\r\n\r\nI read also, that in the year 1247, the 2nd of Edward I., Ri. Raison,\r\nand Atheline his wife, did give to Nicho. de Musely, clerk, ten\r\nshillings of yearly free and quiet rent, out of all his tenements, with\r\nthe houses thereupon built, and their appurtenances, which they had of\r\nthe demise of the master and brethren of Knights Templars, in England,\r\nnext to their mill of Fleet, over against the houses of Laurence de\r\nBrooke, in the parish of St. Andrew, next to Baynard’s castle, which\r\ntenements lie between the way leading towards the said mill on the west\r\npart. Also in the rights belonging to Robert Fitzwater, and to his\r\nheirs, in the city of London, in the time of peace, it was declared\r\nin the year 1303, that the said Robert, castellan of London, and\r\nbanner-bearer, had a soke (or ward) in the city, that was by the wall of\r\nSt. Paule, as men go down the street before the brewhouse of St. Paule\r\nunto the Thames, and so to the side of the mill, which is in the water\r\nthat cometh down from Fleet bridge, and goeth by London wall, betwixt\r\nFryers preachers church and Ludgate; and so that ward turned back by the\r\nhouse of the said Fryers unto the said common wall of the said canonry\r\nof St. Paul; that is, all of the parish of St. Andrew, which is in the\r\ngift of his ancestors by seniority, as more I have shown in the Castles.\r\n\r\nNow here is to be noted, that the wall of London at that time went\r\nstraight south from Ludgate down to the river of Thames; but for\r\nbuilding of the Blacke Fryers church, the said wall in that place was by\r\ncommandment taken down, and a new wall made straight west from Ludgate\r\nto Fleet bridge, and then by the water of Fleet to the river of Thames,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1307, the 35th of Edward I., in a parliament at Carlisle,\r\nHenry Lacie, Earl of Lincoln, complained of noyances done to the water\r\nof the Fleet; whereupon it was granted that the said mill should be\r\nremoved and destroyed.\r\n\r\nThis ward ascendeth up by the east wall of the Black Fryers to the\r\nsouth-west end of Creed lane, where it endeth on that side.\r\n\r\nThen to begin again on the north side of Thames street, over against\r\nHuntington house, by St. Peter’s church and lane, called Peter hill, and\r\nso to St. Benet Hude (or Hithe) over against Powle’s wharf, a proper\r\nparish church, which hath the monuments of Sir William Cheiny, knight,\r\nand Margaret his wife, 1442, buried there; Doctor Caldwell, physician;\r\nSir Gilbert Dethik, knight, _alias_ Garter king at arms. West from this\r\nchurch, by the south end of Adle street, almost against Pudle wharf,\r\nthere is one ancient building of stone and timber, built by the lords\r\nof Barkley, and therefore called Barklies inn. This house is all in\r\nruin, and letten out in several tenements, yet the arms of the Lord\r\nBarkley remain in the stone work of an arched gate, gules, between a\r\ncheveron, crosses ten--three, three, and four. Richard Beauchampe, Earl\r\nof Warwicke, was lodged in this house, then called Barklies inn, in the\r\nparish of St. Andrew, in the reign of Henry VI.\r\n\r\nThen turning up towards the north is the parish church of St. Andrew in\r\nthe Wardrobe, a proper church, but few monuments hath it. John Parnt\r\nfounded a chantry there. Then is the king’s Great Wardrobe: Sir John\r\nBeauchamp, knight of the Garter, Constable of Dover, Warden of the Sinke\r\nports (son to Guido de Beauchampe, Earl of Warwicke), built this house,\r\nwas lodged there, deceased in the year 1359, and was buried on the south\r\nside of the middle aisle of Paule’s church. His executors sold the house\r\nto King Edward III., unto whom the parson of St. Andrewe’s complaining\r\nthat the said Beauchampe had pulled down divers houses, in their place\r\nto build the same house, where through he was hindered of his accustomed\r\ntithes, paid by the tenants of old time, granted him forty shillings by\r\nyear out of that house for ever. King Richard III. was lodged there in\r\nthe second of his reign.\r\n\r\nIn this house of late years is lodged Sir John Fortescue, knight, master\r\nof the wardrobe, chancellor and under-treasurer of the exchequer, and\r\none of her majesty’s most honourable privy council. The secret letters\r\nand writings touching the estate of the realm were wont to be enrolled\r\nin the king’s wardrobe, and not in the chancery, as appeareth by the\r\nrecords. Claus. 18. E. 4. 1. Memb. 13. Claus. 33. E. 1. Memb. 3. Et\r\nliberat. 1. E. 2. Memb. 4, etc. From this wardrobe, by the west end of\r\nCarter lane, then up Creede lane, Ave Mary lane, a piece of Pater Noster\r\nrow, up Warwick lane, all the east side, to a brewhouse called the\r\nCrown, as I said is of this ward. Touching lanes ascending out of Thames\r\nstreet to Knightriders’ street, the first is Peter’s hill, wherein I\r\nfind no matter of note, more than certain alms houses, lately founded on\r\nthe west side thereof, by David Smith, embroiderer, for six poor widows,\r\nwhereof each to have twenty shillings by the year.\r\n\r\nOn the east side of this lane standeth a large house, of ancient\r\nbuilding, sometime belonging to the abbot of St. Mary in York, and was\r\nhis abiding house when he came to London; Thomas Randolfe, esquire, hath\r\nlately augmented and repaired it.\r\n\r\nAt the upper end of this lane, towards the north, the corner-houses\r\nthere be called Peters key, but the reason thereof I have not heard.\r\nThen is Paules wharf hill, on the east side whereof is Woodmongers’\r\nhall. And next adjoining is Darby house, sometime belonging to the\r\nStanleys, for Thomas Stanley, first Earl of Derby of that name, who\r\nmarried the Lady Margaret, Countess of Richmond, mother to Henry VII.,\r\nin his time built it.\r\n\r\nQueen Mary gave it to Gilbert Dethike, then Garter principal king of\r\narms of Englishmen; Thomas Hawley, Clarenceaux king of arms of the south\r\nparts; William Harvy, _alias_ Norroy king of arms of the north parts,\r\nand the other heralds and pursuivants of arms, and to their successors,\r\nall the same capital messuage or house called Derby house, with the\r\nappurtenances, situate in the parish of St. Benet and St. Peter, then\r\nbeing in the tenure of Sir Richard Sackvile, knight, and lately parcel\r\nof the lands of Edward, Earl of Derby, etc., to the end that the said\r\nkings of arms, heralds, and pursuivants of arms, and their successors,\r\nmight at their liking dwell together, and at meet times to congregate,\r\nspeak, confer, and agree among themselves, for the good government of\r\ntheir faculty, and their records might be more safely kept, etc. Dated\r\nthe 18th of July, 1555, Philip and Mary I., and third year.\r\n\r\nThen higher up, near the south chain of Paules churchyard, is the Paule\r\nHead tavern, which house, with the appurtenances, was of old time called\r\nPaules brewhouse, for that the same was so employed, but been since left\r\noff, and let out.\r\n\r\nOn the west side of this street, is one other great house, built of\r\nstone, which belongeth to Paules church, and was sometime let to the\r\nBlunts, Lords Mountjoy, but of latter time to a college in Cambridge,\r\nand from them to the doctors of the civil law and Arches, who keep a\r\ncommons there; and many of them being there lodged, it is called the\r\nDoctors’ Commons. Above this, on the same side, was one other great\r\nbuilding over-against Paules brewhouse, and this was called Paules\r\nbakehouse, and was employed in baking of bread for the church of Paules.\r\n\r\nIn Addle street, or lane, I find no monuments.\r\n\r\nIn Lambart hill lane on the west side thereof, is the Blacksmiths’ hall,\r\nand adjoining to the north side thereof have ye one plot of ground,\r\ninclosed with a brick wall for a churchyard, or burying-plot for the\r\ndead of St. Mary Magdalen’s by Old Fish street, which was given to that\r\nuse by John Iwarby, an officer in the receipt of the exchequer, in the\r\n26th of King Henry VI., as appeareth by patent. John Iwarby, etc., gave\r\na piece of land lying void in the parish of St. Mary Magdalen, nigh to\r\nOld Fish street, between the tenement of John Philpot on the south,\r\nand the tenement of Bartholomewe Burwash on the west, and the tenement\r\npertaining to the convent of the Holy Well on the north, and the way\r\nupon Lambarde’s hill on the east, for a churchyard, to the parson, and\r\nchurchwardens, etc.\r\n\r\nOver-against the north-west end of this Lambard hill lane in\r\nKnightriders’ street, is the parish church of St. Mary Magdalen, a small\r\nchurch, having but few monuments, Richard Woodroffe, merchant tailor,\r\n1519; Barnard Randolph, esquire, 1583.\r\n\r\nOn the west side of this church, by the porch thereof, is placed a\r\nconduit or cistern of lead, castellated with stone, for receipt of\r\nThames water, conveyed at the charges of the before-named Barnard\r\nRandolph, esquire. By the east end of St. Mary Magdalen’s church,\r\nrunneth up the Old Exchange lane, by the west end of Carter lane, to\r\nthe south-east gate or chain of Paule’s churchyard, as is before shown.\r\nAnd in this part was the Exchange kept, and bullion was received for\r\ncoinage, as is noted in Faringdon ward within.\r\n\r\nIn this parish church of St. Mary Magdalen, out of Knightriders’ street\r\nup to Carter lane, be two small lanes, the one of them called Do Little\r\nlane, as a place not inhabited by artificers or open shopkeepers, but\r\nserving for a near passage from Knightriders’ street to Carter lane.\r\n\r\nThe other, corruptly called Sermon lane, for Sheremoniers’ lane, for\r\nI find it by that name recorded in the 14th of Edward I., and in that\r\nlane, a place to be called the Blacke loft (of melting silver) with four\r\nshops adjoining. It may, therefore, be well supposed that lane to take\r\nname of Sheremonyars, such as cut and rounded the plates to be coined\r\nor stamped into sterling pence; for the place of coining was the Old\r\nExchange, near unto the said Sheremoniars’ lane. Also I find that in the\r\n13th of Richard II. William de la Pole had a house there.\r\n\r\nIn Knightriders’ street is the College of Physicians, wherein was\r\nfounded in the year 1582 a public lecture in surgery, to be read twice\r\nevery week, etc., as is shown elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn the south churchyard of Paules, is the south side and west end of the\r\nsaid church; in the which west end be three stately gates or entries,\r\ncuriously wrought of stone: namely, the middle gate, in the midst\r\nwhereof is placed a massy pillar of brass, whereunto the leaves of the\r\nsaid great gate are closed and fastened with locks, bolts, and bars of\r\niron; all which, notwithstanding, on the 24th of December in the year\r\n1565, by a tempest of wind then rising from the west, these gates were\r\nblown open, the bars, bolts, and locks broken in sunder, or greatly\r\nbended. Also on the 5th of January in the year 1589, by a like tempest\r\nof wind, then in the south-west, the lesser west gate of the said\r\nchurch, next to the bishop’s palace, was broken, both bolts, bars, and\r\nlocks, so that the same was blown over.\r\n\r\nAt either corner of this west end is, also of ancient building, a strong\r\ntower of stone, made for bell towers: the one of them, to wit, next to\r\nthe palace, is at this present to the use of the same palace; the other,\r\ntowards the south, is called the Lowlardes’ tower,[263] and hath been\r\nused as the bishop’s prison, for such as were detected for opinions in\r\nreligion, contrary to the faith of the Church.\r\n\r\nThe last prisoner which I have known committed thereto, was in the\r\nyear 1573, one Peter Burcher, gentleman, of the Middle Temple, for\r\nhaving desperately wounded, and minding to have murdered, a serviceable\r\ngentleman named John Hawkins, esquire, in the high street near unto the\r\nStrand, who being taken and examined, was found to hold certain opinions\r\nerroneous, and therefore committed thither, and convicted; but in the\r\nend, by persuasion, he promised to abjure his heresies; and was, by\r\ncommandment of the council, removed from thence to the Tower of London,\r\netc., where he committed as in my _Annales_ I have expressed.\r\n\r\nAdjoining to this Lowlardes’ tower is the parish-church of St. Gregory,\r\nappointed to the petty canons of Paules. Monuments of note I know none\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThe rest of that south side of St. Paules church, with the chapter-house\r\n(a beautiful piece of work, built about the reign of Edward III.) is\r\nnow defaced by means of licenses granted to cutlers, budget-makers, and\r\nothers, first to build low sheds, but now high houses, which do hide\r\nthat beautiful side of the church, save only the top and south gate.\r\n\r\nOn the north-west side of this churchyard is the bishop’s palace, a\r\nlarge thing for receipt, wherein divers kings have been lodged, and\r\ngreat household hath been kept, as appeareth by the great hall, which\r\nof late years, since the rebatement of bishops’ livings, hath not been\r\nfurnished with household menie and guests, as was meant by the builders\r\nthereof, and was of old time used.\r\n\r\nThe dean’s lodging on the other side, directly against the palace,\r\nis a fair old house, and also divers large houses are on the same\r\nside builded, which yet remain, and of old time were the lodgings of\r\nprebendaries and residentiaries, which kept great households and liberal\r\nhospitality, but now either decayed, or otherwise converted.\r\n\r\nThen is the Stationers’ hall on the same side, lately built for them in\r\nplace of Peter College, where in the year 1549, the 4th of January, five\r\nmen were slain by the fall of earth upon them, digging for a well. And\r\nlet this be an end of Baynardes Castle ward, which hath an alderman, his\r\ndeputy, common council nine, constables ten, scavengers seven, wardmote\r\ninquest fourteen, and a beadle. And to the fifteen is taxed at £12, in\r\nthe exchequer £11 13_s._\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[263] For Lowlardes’ Tower, read M. Foxe.--_Stow._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WARD OF FARINGDON EXTRA, OR WITHOUT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe farthest west ward of this city, being the twenty-fifth ward of\r\nLondon, but without the walls, is called Faringdon Without, and was of\r\nold time part of the other Faringdon Within, until the 17th of Richard\r\nII., that it was divided and made twain, by the names of Faringdon\r\n_infra_ and Faringdon _extra_, as is afore shown.\r\n\r\nThe bounds of which ward without Newgate and Ludgate are these: first,\r\non the east part thereof, is the whole precinct of the late priory\r\nof St. Bartholomew, and a part of Long lane on the north, towards\r\nAldersgate street and Ducke lane, with the hospital of St. Bartholomew\r\non the west, and all Smithfield to the bars in St. John Street. Then\r\nout of Smithfield, Chicke lane toward Turmile brook, and over that\r\nbrook by a bridge of timber into the field, then back again by the\r\npens (or folds) in Smithfield, by Smithfield pond to Cow lane, which\r\nturneth toward Oldborne, and then Hosiar lane out of Smithfield, also\r\ntoward Oldborne, till it meet with a part of Cow lane. Then Cocke\r\nlane out of Smithfield, over-against Pie corner, then also is Giltspur\r\nstreet, out of Smithfield to Newgate, then from Newgate west by St.\r\nSepulchres church to Turnagaine lane, to Oldborne conduit, on Snow hill,\r\nto Oldborne bridge, up Oldborne hill to the bars on both sides. On the\r\nright hand or north side, at the bottom of Oldborne hill, is Gold lane,\r\nsometime a filthy passage into the fields, now both sides built with\r\nsmall tenements. Then higher is Lither lane, turning also to the field,\r\nlately replenished with houses built, and so to the bar.\r\n\r\nNow on the left hand or south side from Newgate lieth a street called\r\nthe Old Bayly, or court of the chamberlain of this city; this stretcheth\r\ndown by the wall of the city unto Ludgate, on the west side of which\r\nstreet breaketh out one other lane, called St. Georges lane, till ye\r\ncome to the south end of Seacole lane, and then turning towards Fleet\r\nstreet it is called Fleet lane. The next out of the high street from\r\nNewgate turning down south, is called the Little Bayly, and runneth down\r\nto the east of St. George’s lane. Then is Seacole lane which turneth\r\ndown into Fleet lane; near unto this Seacole lane, in the turning\r\ntowards Oldborne conduit, is another lane, called in records Wind Againe\r\nlane, it turneth down to Turnemill brook, and from thence back again,\r\nfor there is no way over. Then beyond Oldborne bridge to Shoe lane,\r\nwhich runneth out of Oldborne unto the Conduit in Fleet street. Then\r\nalso is Fewtars lane, which likewise stretcheth south into Fleet street\r\nby the east end of St. Dunstans church, and from this lane to the bars\r\nbe the bounds without Newgate.\r\n\r\nNow without Ludgate, this ward runneth by from the said gate to Temple\r\nbar, and hath on the right hand or north side the south end of the Old\r\nBayly, then down Ludgate hill to the Fleet lane over Fleet bridge, and\r\nby Shoe lane and Fewters lane, and so to New street (or Chancery lane),\r\nand up that lane to the house of the Rolles, which house is also of this\r\nward, and on the other side to a lane over against the Rolles, which\r\nentereth Ficquets’ field.\r\n\r\nThen hard by the bar is one other lane called Shyre lane, because it\r\ndivideth the city from the shire, and this turneth into Ficquets’ field.\r\n\r\nFrom Ludgate again on the left hand, or south side to Fleet bridge, to\r\nBride lane, which runneth south by Bridewell, then to Water lane, which\r\nrunneth down to the Thames.\r\n\r\nThen by the White Fryers and by the Temple, even to the bar aforesaid,\r\nbe the bounds of this Faringdon Ward without.\r\n\r\nTouching ornaments and antiquities in this ward, first betwixt the said\r\nNewgate and the parish church of St. Sepulchre’s, is a way towards\r\nSmithfield, called Gilt Spurre, or Knightriders’ street, of the knights\r\nand others riding that way into Smithfield, replenished with buildings\r\non both sides up to Pie corner, a place so called of such a sign,\r\nsometimes a fair inn for receipt of travellers, but now divided into\r\ntenements, and over against the said Pie corner lieth Cocke lane, which\r\nrunneth down to Oldborne conduit.\r\n\r\nBeyond this Pie corner lieth West Smithfield, compassed about with\r\nbuildings, as first on the south side following the right hand, standeth\r\nthe fair parish church and large hospital of St. Bartilmew, founded by\r\nRahere, the first prior of St. Bartilmewes thereto near adjoining, in\r\nthe year 1102.\r\n\r\nAlfune, that had not long before built the parish church of St. Giles\r\nwithout Criplegate, became the first hospitaller, or proctor, for the\r\npoor of the house, and went himself daily to the shambles and other\r\nmarkets, where he begged the charity of devout people for their relief,\r\npromising to the liberal givers (and that by alleging testimonies of\r\nthe holy scripture) reward at the hands of God. Henry III. granted\r\nto Katherine, late wife to W. Hardell, twenty feet of land in length\r\nand breadth in Smithfield, next to the chapel of the hospital of St.\r\nBartilmew, to build her a recluse or anchorage, commanding the mayor and\r\nsheriffs of London to assign the said twenty feet to the said Katherine,\r\nCarta II of Henry III. The foundation of this hospital, for the poor\r\nand diseased their special sustentation, was confirmed by Edward III.\r\nthe 26th of his reign: it was governed by a master and eight brethren,\r\nbeing priests, for the church, and four sisters to see the poor served.\r\nThe executors of R. Whitington, sometime mayor of London, of his goods\r\nrepaired this hospital, about the year 1423.\r\n\r\nSir John Wakering, priest, master of this house in the year 1463,\r\namongst other books, gave to their common library the fairest Bible that\r\nI have seen, written in large vellum by a brother of that house named\r\nJohn Coke, at the age of sixty-eight years, when he had been priest\r\nforty-three years: since the spoil of that library, I have seen this\r\nbook in the custody of my worshipful friend, Master Walter Cope.\r\n\r\nMonuments in this church of the dead, benefactors thereunto, be these:\r\nElizabeth, wife to Adam Hone, gentleman; Bartilmew Bildington; Jane,\r\nwife to John Cooke; Dame Alis, wife to Sir Richarde Isham; Alice, wife\r\nto Nicholas Bayly; John Woodhouse, esquire; Robert Palmar, gentleman;\r\nIdona, wife to John Walden, lying by her husband on the north side,\r\nlate newly built, 1424; Sir Thomas Malifant, or Nanfant, Baron of\r\nWinnow, Lord St. George in Glamorgan, and Lord Ockeneton and Pile in the\r\ncounty of Pembroke, 1438; Dame Margaret his wife, daughter to Thomas\r\nAstley, esquire, with Edmond and Henry his children; William Markeby,\r\ngentleman, 1438; Richard Shepley, and Alice his wife; Thomas Savill,\r\nserjeant-at-arms; Edward Beastby, gentleman, and Margaret his wife;\r\nWaltar Ingham, and Alienar his wife; Robert Warnar, and Alice Lady\r\nCarne; Robert Caldset, Johan and Agnes his wives; Sir Robert Danvars,\r\nand Dame Agnes his wife, daughter to Sir Richard Delaber; William\r\nBrookes, esquire; John Shirley, esquire, and Margaret his wife, having\r\ntheir pictures of brass, in the habit of pilgrims, on a fair flat stone,\r\nwith an epitaph thus:--\r\n\r\n    “Beholde how ended is our poore pilgrimage,\r\n    Of John Shirley, esquier, with Margaret his wife,\r\n    That xii. children had together in marriage,\r\n    Eight sonnes and foure daughters withouten strife,\r\n    That in honor, nurtur, and labour flowed in fame,\r\n    His pen reporteth his lives occupation,\r\n    Since Pier his life time, John Shirley by name,\r\n    Of his degree, that was in Brutes Albion,\r\n    That in the yeare of grace deceased from hen,\r\n    Fourteene hundred winter, and sixe and fiftie.\r\n    In the yeare of his age, fourescore and ten,\r\n    Of October moneth, the day one and twenty.”\r\n\r\nThis gentleman, a great traveller in divers countries, amongst other\r\nhis labours, painfully collected the works of Geffrey Chaucer, John\r\nLidgate, and other learned writers, which works he wrote in sundry\r\nvolumes to remain for posterity; I have seen them, and partly do possess\r\nthem. Jane, Lady Clinton, gave ten pounds to the poor of this house,\r\nwas there buried, 1458; Agnes, daughter to Sir William St. George;\r\nJohn Rogerbrooke, esquire; Richard Sturgeon; Thomas Burgan, gentleman;\r\nElizabeth, wife to Henry Skinard, daughter to Chincroft, esquire;\r\nWilliam Mackley, gentleman, and Alice his wife; W. Fitzwater, gentleman,\r\n1466.\r\n\r\nThis hospital was valued at the suppression in the year 1539, the\r\n31st of Henry VIII., to thirty-five pounds five shillings and seven\r\npence yearly. The church remaineth a parish church to the tenants\r\ndwelling in the precinct of the hospital; but in the year 1546, on the\r\n13th of January, the bishop of Rochester, preaching at Paules cross,\r\ndeclared the gift of the said king to the citizens for relieving of\r\nthe poor, which contained the church of the Gray Fryers, the church of\r\nSt. Bartilmew, with the hospital, the messuages, and appurtenances in\r\nGiltspurre _alias_ Knightriders’ street, Breton street, Petar quay,\r\nin the parish of St. Mary Magdalen, in Old Fish street, and in the\r\nparish of St. Benet Buda, Lymehurst, or Limehost, in the parish of\r\nStebunheth, etc. Then also were orders devised for relief of the poor,\r\nthe inhabitants were all called to their parish churches, whereby Sir\r\nRichard Dobbes, then mayor, their several aldermen, or other grave\r\ncitizens, they were by eloquent orations persuaded how great and how\r\nmany commodities would ensue unto them and their city, if the poor of\r\ndivers sorts, which they named, were taken from out their streets,\r\nlanes, and alleys, and were bestowed and provided for in hospitals\r\nabroad, etc. Therefore was every man moved liberally to grant, what they\r\nwould impart towards the preparing and furnishing of such hospitals, and\r\nalso what they would contribute weekly towards their maintenance for a\r\ntime, which they said should not be past one year, or twain, until they\r\nwere better furnished of endowment: to make short, every man granted\r\nliberally, according to his ability; books were drawn of the relief in\r\nevery ward of the city, towards the new hospitals, and were delivered\r\nby the mayor to the king’s commissioners, on the 17th of February, and\r\norder was taken therein; so as the 26th of July in the year 1552, the\r\nrepairing of the Gray Fryers’ house, for poor fatherless children, was\r\ntaken in hand; and also in the latter end of the same month, began the\r\nrepairing of this hospital of St. Bartilmew, and was of new endowed, and\r\nfurnished at the charges of the citizens.\r\n\r\nOn the east side of this hospital lieth Ducke lane, which runneth out\r\nof Smithfield south to the north end of Little Britaine street. On the\r\neast side of this Ducke lane, and also of Smithfield, lieth the late\r\ndissolved priory of St. Bartilmew, founded also by Rahere, a pleasant\r\nwitted gentleman, and therefore in his time called the king’s minstrel,\r\nabout the year of Christ 1102; he founded it in a part of the oft\r\nbefore-named morish ground, which was therefore a common laystall of all\r\nfilth that was to be voided out of the city; he placed canons there,\r\nhimself became their first prior, and so continued till his dying day,\r\nand was there buried in a fair monument,[264] of late renewed by Prior\r\nBolton.\r\n\r\nAmongst other memorable matters touching this priory, one is of an\r\narchbishop’s visitation, which Matthew Paris hath thus:--Boniface\r\n(saith he) Archbishop of Canterbury, in his visitation came to this\r\npriory, where being received with procession in the most solemn wise,\r\nhe said, that he passed not upon the honour, but came to visit them;\r\nto whom the canons answered, that they having a learned bishop, ought\r\nnot in contempt of him to be visited by any other: which answer so\r\nmuch offended the archbishop, that he forthwith fell on the subprior,\r\nand smote him on the face, saying, “Indeed, indeed, doth it become you\r\nEnglish traitors so to answer me.” Thus raging, with oaths not to be\r\nrecited, he rent in pieces the rich cope of the subprior, and trod it\r\nunder his feet, and thrust him against a pillar of the chancel with such\r\nviolence, that he had almost killed him; but the canons seeing their\r\nsubprior thus almost slain, came and plucked off the archbishop with\r\nsuch force that they overthrew him backwards, whereby they might see\r\nthat he was armed and prepared to fight; the archbishop’s men seeing\r\ntheir master down, being all strangers, and their master’s countrymen,\r\nborn at Provence, fell upon the canons, beat them, tare them, and trod\r\nthem under feet; at length the canons getting away as well as they\r\ncould, ran bloody and miry, rent and torn, to the bishop of London to\r\ncomplain, who bade them go to the king at Westminster, and tell him\r\nthereof; whereupon four of them went thither, the rest were not able,\r\nthey were so sore hurt; but when they came to Westminster, the king\r\nwould neither hear nor see them, so they returned without redress. In\r\nthe mean season the whole city was in an uproar, and ready to have rung\r\nthe common bell, and to have hewn the archbishop into small pieces, who\r\nwas secretly crept to Lambhith, where they sought him, and not knowing\r\nhim by sight, said to themselves, Where is this ruffian? that cruel\r\nsmiter! he is no winner of souls, but an exactor of money, whom neither\r\nGod, nor any lawful or free election did bring to this promotion, but\r\nthe king did unlawfully intrude him, being utterly unlearned, a stranger\r\nborn, and having a wife, etc. But the archbishop conveyed himself over,\r\nand went to the king with a great complaint against the canons, whereas\r\nhimself was guilty. This priory of St. Bartholomew was again new built\r\nin the year 1410.\r\n\r\nBolton was the last prior of this house, a great builder there; for\r\nhe repaired the priory church, with the parish church adjoining, the\r\noffices and lodgings to the said priory belonging, and near adjoining;\r\nhe built anew the manor of Canonbery at Islington, which belonged to the\r\ncanons of this house, and is situate in a low ground, somewhat north\r\nfrom the parish church there; but he built no house at Harrow on the\r\nHill, as Edward Hall hath written, following a fable then on foot. The\r\npeople (saith he) being feared by prognostications, which declared,\r\nthat in the year of Christ 1524 there should be such eclipses in watery\r\nsigns, and such conjunctions, that by waters and floods many people\r\nshould perish, people victualled themselves, and went to high grounds\r\nfor fear of drowning, and especially one Bolton, which was prior of St.\r\nBartholomewes in Smithfield, built him a house upon Harrow on the Hill,\r\nonly for fear of this flood; thither he went, and made provision of all\r\nthings necessary within him for the space of two months, etc.; but this\r\nwas not so indeed, as I have been credibly informed. True it is, that\r\nthis Bolton was also parson of Harrow, and therefore bestowed some small\r\nreparations on the parsonage-house, and built nothing there more than a\r\ndove-house, to serve him when he had forgone his priory.\r\n\r\nTo this priory King Henry II. granted the privilege of fair, to be kept\r\nyearly at Bartholomew tide for three days, to wit, the eve, the day,\r\nand next morrow, to the which the clothiers of all England, and drapers\r\nof London, repaired,[265] and had their booths and standings within the\r\nchurchyard of this priory, closed in with walls, and gates locked every\r\nnight, and watched, for safety of men’s goods and wares; a court of\r\npie powders was daily during the fair holden for debts and contracts.\r\nBut now, notwithstanding all proclamations of the prince, and also the\r\nact of parliament, in place of booths within this churchyard (only let\r\nout in the fair-time, and closed up all the year after), be many large\r\nhouses built, and the north wall towards Long lane taken down, a number\r\nof tenements are there erected for such as will give great rents.\r\n\r\nMonuments of the dead in this priory are these: of Rahere, the first\r\nfounder; Roger Walden, Bishop of London, 1406; John Wharton, gentleman,\r\nand Elizabeth his wife, daughter to William Scot, esquire; John Louth,\r\ngentleman; Robert Shikeld, gentleman; Sir ---- Bacon, knight; John\r\nLudlow and Alice his wife; W. Thirlewall, esquire; Richard Lancaster,\r\nherald-at-arms; Thomas Torald; John Royston; John Watforde; John\r\nCarleton; Robert, son to Sir Robert Willowby; Gilbert Halstocke;\r\nEleanor, wife to Sir Hugh Fen, mother to Margaret Lady Burgavenie;\r\nWilliam Essex, esquire; Richard Vancke, baron of the exchequer, and\r\nMargaret his wife, daughter to William de la Rivar; John Winderhall;\r\nJohn Duram, esquire, and Elizabeth his wife; John Malwaine; Alice, wife\r\nto Balstred, daughter to Kniffe; William Scarlet, esquire; John Golding;\r\nHugh Waltar, gentleman; and the late Sir Waltar Mildmay, knight,\r\nchancellor of the exchequer, etc.\r\n\r\nThis priory at the late surrender, the 30th of Henry VIII., was valued\r\nat £653 15_s._ by year.\r\n\r\nThis church having in the bell-tower six bells in a tune, those bells\r\nwere sold to the parish of St. Sepulchre’s; and then the church being\r\npulled down to the choir, the choir was, by the king’s order, annexed\r\nfor the enlarging of the old parish church thereto adjoining, and so was\r\nused till the reign of Queen Mary, who gave the remnant of the priory\r\nchurch to the Friers preachers, or Black Friers, and was used as their\r\nconventual church until, the 1st of our sovereign lady Queen Elizabeth,\r\nthose friars were put out, and all the said church, with the old parish\r\nchurch, was wholly as it stood in the last year of Edward VI., given by\r\nparliament to remain for ever a parish church to the inhabitants within\r\nthe close called Great St. Bartholomewes. Since the which time that old\r\nparish church is pulled down, except the steeple of rotten timber ready\r\nto fall of itself. I have oft heard it reported, that a new steeple\r\nshould be built with the stone, lead, and timber of the old parish\r\nchurch, but no such thing was performed. The parish have lately repaired\r\nthe old wooden steeple to serve their turn. On the north side of this\r\npriory is the lane truly called Long, which reacheth from Smithfield to\r\nAldersgate street. This lane is now lately built on both the sides with\r\ntenements for brokers, tipplers, and such like; the rest of Smithfield\r\nfrom Long lane end to the bars is enclosed with inns, brewhouses, and\r\nlarge tenements; on the west side is Chicken lane down to Cowbridge.\r\nThen be the pens or folds, so called, of sheep there parted, and penned\r\nup to be sold on the market-days.\r\n\r\nThen is Smithfield pond, which of old time in records was called\r\nHorse-pool, for that men watered horses there, and was a great water.\r\nIn the 6th of Henry V. a new building was made in this west part of\r\nSmithfield betwixt the said pool and the river of the Wels, or Turnemill\r\nbrooke, in a place then called the Elmes, for that there grew many\r\nelm-trees; and this had been the place of execution for offenders; since\r\nthe which time the building there hath been so increased, that now\r\nremaineth not one tree growing.\r\n\r\nAmongst these new buildings is Cowbridge street, or Cow lane, which\r\nturneth toward Oldborne, in which lane the prior of Semperingham had his\r\ninn, or London lodging.\r\n\r\nThe rest of that west side of Smithfield hath divers fair inns, and\r\nother comely buildings, up to Hosiar lane, which also turneth down to\r\nOldborne till it meet with Cowbridge street. From this lane to Cocke\r\nlane, over against Pie corner.\r\n\r\nAnd thus much for encroachments and enclosure of this Smithfield,\r\nwhereby remaineth but a small portion for the old uses; to wit, for\r\nmarkets of horses and cattle, neither for military exercises, as\r\njoustings, turnings, and great triumphs, which have been there performed\r\nbefore the princes and nobility both of this realm and foreign countries.\r\n\r\nFor example to note:--In the year 1357, the 31st of Edward III., great\r\nand royal jousts were there holden in Smithfield; there being present,\r\nthe Kings of England, France, and Scotland, with many other nobles and\r\ngreat estates of divers lands.\r\n\r\n1362, the 36th of Edward III., on the first five days of May, in\r\nSmithfield, were jousts holden, the king and queen being present, with\r\nthe most part of the chivalry of England, and of France, and of other\r\nnations, to the which came Spaniards, Cyprians and Arminians, knightly\r\nrequesting the king of England against the pagans that invaded their\r\nconfines.\r\n\r\nThe 48th of Edward III., Dame Alice Perrers (the king’s concubine),\r\nas Lady of the Sun, rode from the Tower of London, through Cheape,\r\naccompanied of many lords and ladies, every lady leading a lord by his\r\nhorse-bridle, till they came into West Smithfield, and then began a\r\ngreat joust, which endured seven days after.\r\n\r\nAlso, the 9th of Richard II., was the like great riding from the Tower\r\nto Westminster, and every lord led a lady’s horse-bridle; and on the\r\nmorrow began the joust in Smithfield, which lasted two days: there\r\nbare them well, Henry of Darby, the Duke of Lankester’s son, the Lord\r\nBeaumont, Sir Simon Burley, and Sir Paris Courtney.\r\n\r\nIn the 14th of Richard II., after Froisart, royal jousts and tournaments\r\nwere proclaimed to be done in Smithfield, to begin on Sunday next\r\nafter the feast of St. Michael. Many strangers came forth of other\r\ncountries, namely, Valarian, Earl of St. Paul, that had married King\r\nRichard’s sister, the Lady Maud Courtney, and William, the young Earl\r\nof Ostervant, son to Albart of Baviere, Earl of Holland and Henault.\r\nAt the day appointed there issued forth of the Tower, about the third\r\nhour of the day, sixty coursers, apparelled for the jousts, and upon\r\nevery one an esquire of honour, riding a soft pace; then came forth\r\nsixty ladies of honour, mounted upon palfreys, riding on the one side,\r\nrichly apparelled, and every lady led a knight with a chain of gold,\r\nthose knights being on the king’s party, had their harness and apparel\r\ngarnished with white harts, and crowns of gold about the harts’ necks,\r\nand so they came riding through the streets of London to Smithfield,\r\nwith a great number of trumpets, and other instruments of music before\r\nthem. The king and queen, who were lodged in the bishop’s palace of\r\nLondon, were come from thence, with many great estates, and placed in\r\nchambers to see the jousts; the ladies that led the knights were taken\r\ndown from their palfreys, and went up to chambers prepared for them.\r\nThen alighted the esquires of honour from their coursers, and the\r\nknights in good order mounted upon them; and after their helmets were\r\nset on their heads, and being ready in all points, proclamation made by\r\nthe heralds, the jousts began, and many commendable courses were run, to\r\nthe great pleasure of the beholders. These jousts continued many days,\r\nwith great feasting, as ye may read in Froisart.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1393, the 17th of Richard II., certain lords of Scotland\r\ncame into England to get worship by force of arms; the Earl of Mare\r\nchallenged the Earl of Notingham to joust with him, and so they rode\r\ntogether certain courses, but not the full challenge, for the Earl\r\nof Mare was cast both horse and man, and two of his ribs broken with\r\nthe fall, so that he was conveyed out of Smithfield, and so towards\r\nScotland, but died by the way at Yorke. Sir William Darell, knight,\r\nthe king’s banner-bearer of Scotland, challenged Sir Percie Courtney,\r\nknight, the king’s banner-bearer of England; and when they had run\r\ncertain courses, gave over without conclusion of victory. Then\r\nCookeborne, esquire, of Scotland, challenged Sir Nicholas Hawberke,\r\nknight, and rode five courses, but Cookeborne was borne over horse and\r\nman, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1409, the 10th of Henry IV., a great play was played at the\r\nSkinners’ well, which lasted eight days, where were to see the same the\r\nmost part of the nobles and gentles in England. And forthwith began\r\na royal jousting in Smithfield between the Earl of Somerset, and the\r\nSeneschal of Henalt, Sir John Cornwall, Sir Richard Arrundell, and the\r\nson of Sir John Cheiney, against certain Frenchmen. And the same year\r\na battle was fought in Smithfield between two esquires, the one called\r\nGlaucester, appellant, and the other Arthure, defendant; they fought\r\nvaliantly, but the king took up the quarrel into his hands, and pardoned\r\nthem both.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1430, the 8th of Henry VI., the 14th of January, a battle\r\nwas done in Smithfield, within the lists, before the king, between two\r\nmen of Feversham in Kent, John Upton, notary, appellant, and John Downe,\r\ngentleman, defendant; John Upton put upon John Downe, that he and his\r\ncompeers should imagine the king’s death the day of his coronation. When\r\nthese had fought long, the king took up the matter, and forgave both the\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1442, the 20th of Henry VI., the 30th of January, a\r\nchallenge was done in Smithfield, within lists, before the king, there\r\nbeing Sir Philip la Beaufe of Aragon, knight, the other an esquire of\r\nthe king’s house, called John Ansley or Anstley; they came to the field\r\nall armed, the knight with his sword drawn, and the esquire with his\r\nspear, which spear he cast against the knight, but the knight avoided\r\nit with his sword, and cast it to the ground; then the esquire took his\r\naxe, and smote many blows on the knight, and made him let fall his axe,\r\nand brake up his uniber three times, and would have smote him on the\r\nface with his dagger, for to have slain him, but then the king cried\r\nhold, and so they were departed. The king made John Ansley, knight, and\r\nthe knight of Aragon offered his harness at Windsor.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1446, the 24th of Henry VI., John David appeached his\r\nmaster, Wil. Catur, of treason, and a day being assigned them to fight\r\nin Smithfield; the master being well-beloved, was so cherished by\r\nhis friends, and plied with wine, that being therewith overcome, was\r\nalso unluckily slain by his servant; but that false servant (for he\r\nfalsely accused his master) lived not long unpunished, for he was after\r\nhanged at Teyborne for felony. Let such false accusers note this for\r\nexample,[266] and look for no better end without speedy repentance.\r\n\r\nThe same year Thomas Fitz-Thomas Prior of Kilmaine appeached Sir James\r\nButlar, Earl of Ormond, of treasons; which had a day assigned them to\r\nfight in Smithfield, the lists were made, and the field prepared; but\r\nwhen it came to the point, the king commanded they should not fight, and\r\ntook the quarrel into his hands.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1467, the 7th of Edward IV., the Bastard of Burgoine\r\nchallenged the Lord Scales, brother to the queen, to fight with him\r\nboth on horseback and on foot; the king, therefore, caused lists to be\r\nprepared in Smithfield, the length of one hundred and twenty tailors’\r\nyards and ten feet, and in breadth eighty yards and twenty feet,\r\ndouble-barred, five feet between the bars, the timber-work whereof\r\ncost two hundred marks, besides the fair and costly galleries prepared\r\nfor the ladies and other, at the which martial enterprise the king and\r\nnobility were present. The first day they ran together with spears, and\r\ndeparted with equal honour. The next day they tourneyed on horseback,\r\nthe Lord Scales horse having on his chafron, a long spear pike of\r\nsteel; and as the two champions coped together, the same horse thrust\r\nhis pike into the nostrils of the Bastard’s horse, so that for very\r\npain he mounted so high that he fell on the one side with his master,\r\nand the Lord Scales rode about him with his sword drawn, till the king\r\ncommanded the marshal to help up the Bastard, who said, I cannot hold me\r\nby the clouds; for though my horse fail me, I will not fail an encounter\r\ncompanion; but the king would not suffer them to do any more that day.\r\n\r\nThe next morrow they came into the lists on foot with two pole-axes, and\r\nfought valiantly; but at the last the point of the pole-axe of the Lord\r\nScales entered into the side of the Bastard’s helm, and by force might\r\nhave placed him on his knees; but the king cast down his warder, and the\r\nmarshal severed them. The Bastard required that he might perform his\r\nenterprise; but the king gave judgment as the Bastard relinquished his\r\nchallenge, etc. And this may suffice for jousts in Smithfield.\r\n\r\nNow to return through Giltspur street by Newgate, where I first began,\r\nthere standeth the fair parish church called St. Sepulchers in the\r\nBayly, or by Chamberlain gate, in a fair churchyard, though not so\r\nlarge as of old time, for the same is letten out for buildings and a\r\ngarden-plot.\r\n\r\nThis church was newly re-edified or built about the reign of Henry VI.\r\nor of Edward IV. One of the Pophames was a great builder there, namely,\r\nof one fair chapel on the south side of the choir, as appeareth by his\r\narms and other monuments in the glass windows thereof, and also the fair\r\nporch of the same church towards the south; his image, fair graven in\r\nstone, was fixed over the said porch, but defaced and beaten down; his\r\ntitle by offices was this, Chancellor of Normandy, Captain of Vernoyle,\r\nPearch, Susan, and Bayon, and treasurer of the king’s household: he died\r\nrich, leaving great treasure of strange coins, and was buried in the\r\nCharterhouse church by West Smithfield. The first nobilitating of these\r\nPophames was by Matilda the empress, daughter to Henry I., and by Henry\r\nher son: one Pophame, gentleman, of very fair lands in Southamptonshire,\r\ndied without issue male, about Henry VI., and leaving four daughters,\r\nthey were married to Fostar, Barentine, Wodham, and Hamden. Popham Deane\r\n(distant three miles from Clarendon, and three miles from Mortisham) was\r\nsometime the chief lordship or manor-house of these Pophames.\r\n\r\nThere lie buried in this church, William Andrew, Stephen Clamparde,\r\nLawrence Warcam, John Dagworth, William Porter, Robert Scarlet, esquires.\r\n\r\nNext to this church is a fair and large inn for receipt of travellers,\r\nand hath to sign the Sarasen’s head.\r\n\r\nThere lieth a street from Newgate west to the end of Turnagaine lane,\r\nand winding north to Oldborne conduit. This conduit by Oldborne cross\r\nwas first built 1498. Thomasin, widow to John Percival, mayor, gave to\r\nthe second making thereof twenty marks, Richard Shore ten pounds. Thomas\r\nKnesworth and others also did give towards it.\r\n\r\nBut of late a new conduit was there built in place of the old, namely,\r\nin the year 1577, by William Lamb, sometime a gentleman of the chapel\r\nto King Henry VIII., and afterward a citizen and clothworker of London;\r\nthe water thereof he caused to be conveyed in lead, from divers springs\r\nto one head, and from thence to the said conduit, and waste of one cock\r\nat Oldborne bridge, more than two thousand yards in length; all of which\r\nwas by him performed at his own charges, amounting to the sum of fifteen\r\nhundred pounds.\r\n\r\nFrom the west side of this conduit is the high way, there called Snor\r\nhill; it stretcheth out by Oldborne bridge over the oft-named water of\r\nTurmill brook, and so up to Oldborne hill, all replenished with fair\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nWithout Oldborne bridge, on the right hand, is Gold lane, as is before\r\nshown; up higher on the hill be certain inns, and other fair buildings,\r\namongst the which of old time was a messuage called Scropes inn, for so\r\nI find the same recorded in the 37th of Henry VI.\r\n\r\nThis house was sometime letten out to serjeants-at-the-law, as\r\nappeareth, and was found by inquisition taken in the Guild hall of\r\nLondon, before William Purchase, mayor, and escheator for the king,\r\nHenry VII., in the 14th of his reign, after the death of John Lord\r\nScrope, that he died deceased in his demesne of fee, by the feoffment\r\nof Guy Fairfax, knight, one of the king’s justices, made in the 9th of\r\nthe same king, unto the said John Scrope, knight. Lord Scrope of Bolton,\r\nand Robert Wingfield, esquire, of one house or tenement, late called\r\nSergeants’ inn, situate against the church of St. Andrew in Oldborne,\r\nin the city of London, with two gardens and two messuages to the same\r\ntenement belonging in the said city, to hold in burgage, valued by the\r\nyear in all reprises ten shillings.\r\n\r\nThen is the bishop of Elie’s inn,[267] so called of belonging and\r\npertaining to the bishops of Elie. William de Luda, bishop of Elie,\r\ndeceased 1297, gave this house by the name of his manor, with the\r\nappurtenances in Oldborne, to his successors, with condition his\r\nnext successor should pay one thousand marks to the finding of three\r\nchaplains in the chapel there. More, John Hotham, bishop of Elie, did\r\ngive by the name of six messuages, two cellars, and forty acres of land,\r\nin the suburbs of London, in the parish of St. Andrew in Oldborne, to\r\nthe prior and convent of Elie, as appeareth by patent, the 9th of Edward\r\nIII.: this man was bishop of Elie twenty years, and deceased 1336.\r\n\r\nThomas Arundell, bishop of Elie, beautifully built of new his palace\r\nat Elie, and likewise his manors in divers places, especially this\r\nin Oldborne, which he did not only repair, but rather new-built, and\r\naugmented it with a large port, gate-house, or front, towards the street\r\nor highway; his arms are yet to be discerned in the stone-work thereof:\r\nhe sat bishop of Elie fourteen years, and was translated to Yorke.\r\n\r\nIn this house, for the large and commodious rooms thereof,\r\ndivers great and solemn feasts have been kept, especially by the\r\nserjeants-at-the-law, whereof twain are to be noted for posterity.\r\n\r\nThe first in the year 1464, the 4th of Edward IV., in Michaelmas term,\r\nthe serjeants-at-law held their feast in this house, to the which,\r\namongst other estates, Matthew Phillip, mayor of London, with the\r\naldermen, sheriffs, and commons, of divers crafts, being invited, did\r\nrepair; but when the mayor looked to keep the state in the hall, as\r\nit had been used in all places within the city and liberties (out of\r\nthe king’s presence), the Lord Gray of Ruthen, then lord treasurer of\r\nEngland, unwitting the Serjeants, and against their wills (as they\r\nsaid), was first placed; whereupon the mayor, aldermen, and commons,\r\ndeparted home, and the mayor made the aldermen to dine with him; howbeit\r\nhe and all the citizens were wonderfully displeased, that he was so\r\ndealt with; and the new serjeants and others were right sorry therefore,\r\nand had rather then much good (as they said) it had not so happened.\r\n\r\nOne other feast was likewise there kept in the year 1531, the 23rd of\r\nKing Henry VIII.: the serjeants then made were in number eleven; namely,\r\nThomas Audeley, Walter Luke, I. Bawdwine, I. Hinde, Christopher Jennie,\r\nJohn Dowsell, Edward Mervine, Edmond Knightley, Roger Chomley, Edward\r\nMontague, and Robert Yorke.\r\n\r\nThese also held their feast in this Elie house for five days, to wit,\r\nFriday the 10th of November, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday. On\r\nMonday (which was their principal day) King Henry and Queen Katherine\r\ndined there (but in two chambers), and the foreign ambassadors in a\r\nthird chamber. In the hall, at the high table, sat Sir Nicholas Lambard,\r\nMayor of London, the judges, the barons of the exchequer, with certain\r\naldermen of the city. At the board on the south side sat the master\r\nof the rolls, the master of the chancery, and worshipful citizens. On\r\nthe north side of the hall certain aldermen began the board, and then\r\nfollowed merchants of the city; in the cloister, chapel, and gallery,\r\nknights, esquires, and gentlemen, were placed; in the halls the crafts\r\nof London; the serjeants-of-law and their wives, kept in their own\r\nchambers.\r\n\r\nIt were tedious to set down the preparation of fish, flesh, and other\r\nvictuals, spent in this feast, and would seem almost incredible,\r\nand, as to me it seemeth, wanted little of a feast at a coronation;\r\nnevertheless, a little I will touch, for declaration of the change of\r\nprices. There were brought to the slaughter-house twenty-four great\r\nbeefs at twenty-six shillings and eight pence the piece from the\r\nshambles, one carcass of an ox at twenty-four shillings, one hundred\r\nfat muttons, two shillings and ten pence the piece, fifty-one great\r\nveals at four shillings and eight pence the piece, thirty-four porks\r\nthree shillings and eight pence the piece, ninety-one pigs, sixpence the\r\npiece, capons of grese, of one poulter (for they had three) ten dozens\r\nat twenty pence the piece, capons of Kent, nine dozens and six at twelve\r\npence the piece, capons coarse, nineteen dozen at six pence the piece,\r\ncocks of grose, seven dozen and nine at eight pence the piece, cocks\r\ncoarse, fourteen dozen and eight at three pence the piece, pullets, the\r\nbest, two pence halfpenny, other pullets two pence, pigeons thirty-seven\r\ndozen at ten pence the dozen, swans fourteen dozen, larks three hundred\r\nand forty dozen at five pence the dozen, etc. Edward Nevill was\r\nseneschal or steward, Thomas Ratcliffe, comptroller, Thomas Wildon,\r\nclerk of the kitchen.\r\n\r\nNext beyond this manor of Ely house is Lither lane, turning into the\r\nfield. Then is Furnivalles inn, now an inn of chancery, but sometime\r\nbelonging to Sir William Furnivall, knight, and Thomesin his wife, who\r\nhad in Oldborne two messuages and thirteen shops, as appeareth by record\r\nof Richard II., in the 6th of his reign.\r\n\r\nThen is the Earl of Bathes inn, now called Bath place, of late for the\r\nmost part new built, and so to the bars.\r\n\r\nNow again, from Newgate, on the left hand, or south side, lieth the Old\r\nBayly, which runneth down by the wall upon the ditch of the city, called\r\nHoundes ditch, to Ludgate. I have not read how this street took that\r\nname, but is like to have risen of some court, of old time there kept;\r\nand I find, that in the year 1356, the 34th of Edward III., the tenement\r\nand ground upon Houndes ditch, between Ludgate on the south, and Newgate\r\non the north, was appointed to John Cambridge, fishmonger, Chamberlain\r\nof London, whereby it seemeth that the chamberlains of London have\r\nthere kept their courts, as now they do by the Guildhall, and till this\r\nday the mayor and justices of this city kept their sessions in a part\r\nthereof, now called the Sessions hall, both for the city of London and\r\nshire of Middlesex. Over against the which house, on the right hand,\r\nturneth down St. George’s lane towards Fleet lane.\r\n\r\nIn this St. George’s lane, on the north side thereof, remaineth yet an\r\nold wall of stone, enclosing a piece of ground up Seacole lane, wherein\r\nby report sometime stood an inn of chancery; which house being greatly\r\ndecayed, and standing remote from other houses of that profession, the\r\ncompany removed to a common hostelry, called of the sign Our Lady inn,\r\nnot far from Clement’s inn, which they procured from Sir John Fineox,\r\nlord chief justice of the king’s bench, and since have held it of the\r\nowners by the name of the New inn, paying therefore six pounds rent by\r\nthe year, as tenants at their own will, for more (as is said) cannot be\r\ngotten of them, and much less will they be put from it. Beneath this St.\r\nGeorge’s lane, the lane called Fleet lane, winding south by the prison\r\nof the Fleet into Fleet street by Fleet bridge. Lower down in the Old\r\nBayly is at this present a standard of timber, with a cock or cocks,\r\ndelivering fair spring water to the inhabitants, and is the waste of the\r\nwater serving the prisoners in Ludgate.\r\n\r\nNext out of the high street turneth down a lane called the Little\r\nBayly, which runneth down to the east end of St. George’s lane. The next\r\nis Seacole lane, I think called Limeburner’s lane, of burning lime there\r\nwith seacole. For I read in record of such a lane to have been in the\r\nparish of St. Sepulcher, and there yet remaineth in this lane an alley\r\ncalled Limeburner’s alley. Near unto this Seacole lane, in the turning\r\ntowards Oldborne conduit is Turnagain lane, or rather, as in a record\r\nof the 5th of Edward III., Windagain lane, for that it goeth down west\r\nto Fleet dike, from whence men must turn again the same way they came,\r\nfor there it stopped. Then the high street turneth down Snore hill to\r\nOldborne conduit, and from thence to Oldborne bridge, beyond the which\r\nbridge, on the left hand, is Shoe lane, by the which men pass from\r\nOldborne to Fleet street, by the conduit there. In this Shoe lane, on\r\nthe left hand, is one old house called Oldborne hall, it is now letten\r\nout into divers tenements.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, at the very corner, standeth the parish church of\r\nSt. Andrew, in the which church, or near thereunto, was sometime kept\r\na grammar school, as appeareth in another place by a patent made, as\r\nI have shown, for the erection of schools. There be monuments in this\r\nchurch of Thomas Lord Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton, buried 1550;\r\nRalph Rokeby of Lincoln’s inn, esquire, Master of St. Katherine’s and\r\none of the masters of requests to the queen’s majesty, who deceased the\r\n14th of June, 1596. He gave by his testament to Christ’s Hospital in\r\nLondon one hundred pounds, to the college of the poor of Queen Elizabeth\r\nin East Greenwich one hundred pounds, to the poor scholars in Cambridge\r\none hundred pounds, to the poor scholars in Oxford one hundred pounds,\r\nto the prisoners in the two compters in London two hundred pounds, to\r\nthe prisoners in the Fleet one hundred pounds, to the prisoners in\r\nLudgate one hundred pounds, to the prisoners in Newgate one hundred\r\npounds, to the prisoners in the King’s Bench one hundred pounds, to the\r\nprisoners in the Marshalsea one hundred pounds, to the prisoners in the\r\nWhite Lion twenty pounds, to the poor of St. Katherine’s twenty pounds,\r\nand to every brother and sister there forty shillings; William Sydnam\r\nfounded a chantry there. There was also of old time (as I have read\r\nin the 3rd of Henry V.) an hospital for the poor, which was a cell to\r\nthe house of Cluny in France, and was, therefore, suppressed among the\r\npriories aliens.\r\n\r\nFrom this church of St. Andrew, up Oldborne hill be divers fair built\r\nhouses, amongst the which, on the left hand, there standeth three inns\r\nof Chancery, whereof the first adjoining unto Crookhorn alley is called\r\nThaves inn, and standeth opposite, or over against the said Elyhouse.\r\nThen is Fewter lane, which stretcheth south into Fleet street, by the\r\neast end of St. Dunstone’s church, and is so called of Fewters’[268] (or\r\nidle people) lying there, as in a way leading to gardens; but the same\r\nis now of latter years on both sides built through with many fair houses.\r\n\r\nBeyond this Fewter lane is Barnard’s inn, _alias_ Mackworth’s inn, which\r\nis of Chancery, belonging to the dean and chapter of Lincoln, as saith\r\nthe record of Henry VI., the 32nd of his reign, and was founded by\r\ninquisition in the Guildhall of London, before John Norman, mayor, the\r\nking’s escheator; the jury said, that it was not hurtful for the king to\r\nlicense T. Atkens, citizen of London, and one of the executors to John\r\nMackworth, Dean of Lincoln, to give one messuage in Holborn in London,\r\nwith the appurtenances called Mackworth’s inn, but now commonly known by\r\nthe name of Barnardes inn, to the dean and chapter of Lincoln, to find\r\none sufficient chaplain to celebrate Divine service in the chapel of St.\r\nGeorge, in the cathedral church of Lincoln, where the body of the said\r\nJohn is buried, to have and to hold the said messuage to the said dean\r\nand chapter, and to their successors for ever, in part of satisfaction\r\nof twenty pounds lands and rents, which Edward III. licensed the said\r\ndean and chapter to purchase to their own use, either of their own fee\r\nor tenor, or of any other, so the lands were not holden of the king _in\r\ncapite_.\r\n\r\nThen is Staple inn, also of Chancery, but whereof so named I am\r\nignorant; the same of late is for a great part thereof fair built, and\r\nnot a little augmented. And then at the bar endeth this ward without\r\nNewgate.\r\n\r\nWithout Ludgate, on the right hand, or north side from the said gate\r\nlieth the Old Bayly, as I said, then the high street called Ludgate hill\r\ndown to Fleet lane, in which lane standeth the Fleet, a prison house so\r\ncalled of the Fleet or water running by it, and sometime flowing about\r\nit, but now vaulted over.\r\n\r\nI read that Richard I., in the 1st of his reign, confirmed to Osbert,\r\nbrother to William Longshampe, Chancellor of England and elect of\r\nElie, and to his heirs for ever, the custody of his house or palace\r\nat Westminster, with the keeping of his gaol of the Fleet at London;\r\nalso King John, by his patent, dated the 3rd of his reign, gave to\r\nthe Archdeacon of Welles, the custody of the said king’s house at\r\nWestminster, and of his gaol of the Fleet, together with the wardship\r\nof the daughter and heir of Robert Loveland, etc. Then is Fleet bridge\r\npitched over the said water, whereof I have spoken in another place.\r\n\r\nThen also against the south end of Shoe lane standeth a fair\r\nwater-conduit, whereof William Eastfield, sometime mayor, was founder;\r\nfor the mayor and commonalty of London being possessed of a conduit\r\nhead, with divers springs of water gathered thereinto in the parish of\r\nPadington, and the water conveyed from thence by pipes of lead towards\r\nLondon unto Teyborne; where it had lain by the space of six years or\r\nmore; the executors of Sir William Eastfield obtained licence of the\r\nmayor and commonalty for them, in the year 1453, with the goods of\r\nSir William to convey the said waters, first in pipes of lead into a\r\npipe begun to be laid beside the great conduit head at Maribone, which\r\nstretcheth from thence unto a separall, late before made against the\r\nchapel of Rounsevall by Charing cross, and no further, and then from\r\nthence to convey the said water into the city, and there to make receipt\r\nor receipts for the same unto the common weal of the commonalty, to wit,\r\nthe poor to drink, the rich to dress their meats; which water was by\r\nthem brought thus into Fleet street to a standard, which they had made\r\nand finished 1471.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Fleet street, in the year 1478, obtained licence of\r\nthe mayor, aldermen, and commonalty, to make at their own charges two\r\ncisterns, the one to be set at the said standard, the other at Fleet\r\nbridge, for the receipt of the waste water; this cistern at the standard\r\nthey built, and on the same a fair tower of stone, garnished with images\r\nof St. Christopher on the top, and angels round about lower down, with\r\nsweet sounding bells before them, whereupon, by an engine placed in the\r\ntower, they divers hours of the day and night chimed such an hymn as was\r\nappointed.\r\n\r\nThis conduit, or standard, was again new built with a larger cistern, at\r\nthe charges of the city, in the year 1582.\r\n\r\nFrom this conduit up to Fewtars lane, and further, is the parish church\r\nof St. Dunstan called in the West (for difference from St. Dunstan in\r\nthe East), here lieth buried T. Duke, skinner, in St. Katherin’s chapel\r\nby him built, 1421; Nicholas Coningstone, John Knape, and other, founded\r\nchantries there; Ralph Bane, Bishop of Coventrie and Lichfield, 1559,\r\nand other.\r\n\r\nNext beyond this church is Clifford’s inn, sometime belonging to Robert\r\nClifford, by gift of Edward II. in these words: “The king granteth to\r\nRobert Clifford that messuage, with the appurtenances, next the church\r\nof St. Dunstane in the West, in the suburbs of London, which messuage\r\nwas sometime Malculines de Herley, and came to the hands of Edward\r\nI., by reason of certaine debts which the said Malculine was bound at\r\nthe time of his death to our styde father, from the time that hee was\r\nescaetor on this side Trent; which house John, Earle of Richmount, did\r\nholde of our pleasure, and is now in our possession.”--Patent, the 3rd\r\nof Edward II. After the death of this Robert Clifford, Isabel, his wife,\r\nlet the same messuage to students of the law, as by the record following\r\nmay appear:--\r\n\r\n“_Isabel quæ fuit uxor Roberti Clifford, Messuagium unipartitum, quod\r\nRobertus Clifford habuit in parochia sci. Dunstonis West. in suburbio\r\nLondini, etc., tenuit, et illud dimisit post mortem dict. Roberti,\r\nApprenticiis de banco, pro x. li. annuatium, etc. Anno 18 Eduardi\r\nTertii, inquisitio post mortem Roberti Clifford._”\r\n\r\nThis house hath since fallen into the king’s hands, as I have heard, but\r\nreturned again to the Cliffordes, and is now let to the said students\r\nfor four pounds by the year.\r\n\r\nSomewhat beyond this Clifford’s inn is the south end of New street (or\r\nChancelar lane), on the right hand whereof is Sergeantes’ inn called in\r\nChauncery lane. And then next was sometime the house of the converted\r\nJewes, founded by King Henry III., in place of a Jewe’s house to him\r\nforfeited, in the year 1233, and the 17th of his reign, who built\r\nthere for them a fair church now used, and called the chapel for the\r\ncustody of the Rolles and Records of Chancerie. It standeth not far\r\nfrom the Old Temple, but in the midway between the Old Temple and the\r\nNew, in the which house all such Jewes and infidels, as were converted\r\nto the Christian faith, were ordained and appointed, under an honest\r\nrule of life, sufficient maintenance, whereby it came to pass, that in\r\nshort time there were gathered a great number of converts, which were\r\nbaptized, instructed in the doctrine of Christ, and there lived under\r\na learned Christian appointed to govern them; since the which time, to\r\nwit, in the year 1290, all the Jews in England were banished out of the\r\nrealm, whereby the number of converts in this place was decayed: and,\r\ntherefore, in the year 1377, this house was annexed by patent to William\r\nBurstall Clearke, custos rotulorum, or keeper of the Rolles of the\r\nChauncerie, by Edward III., in the 5th year of his reign; and this first\r\nMaster of the Rolles was sworn in Westminster hall, at the table of\r\nmarble stone; since the which time, that house hath been commonly called\r\nthe Rolles in Chancerie lane.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding such of the Jewes, or other infidels, as have in this\r\nrealm been converted to Christianity, and baptized, have been relieved\r\nthere; for I find in record that one William Piers, a Jew that became a\r\nChristian, was baptised in the fifth of Richard II., and had two pence\r\nthe day allowed him during his life by the said king.\r\n\r\nOn the west side was sometime a house pertaining to the prior of Necton\r\nParke, a house of canons in Lincolnshire; this was commonly called\r\nHereflete inn, and was a brewhouse, but now fair built for the five\r\nclerks of the Chancerie, and standeth over against the said house called\r\nthe Rolles, and near unto the lane which now entereth Fickets croft, or\r\nFickets field. Then is Shere lane, opening also into Fickets field, hard\r\nby the bars.\r\n\r\nOn this north side of Fleet street, in the year of Christ 1595, I\r\nobserved, that when the labourers had broken up the pavement, from\r\nagainst Chancerie lane’s end up towards St. Dunston’s church, and had\r\ndigged four feet deep, they found one other pavement of hard stone, more\r\nsufficient than the first, and, therefore, harder to be broken, under\r\nthe which they found in the made ground, piles of timber driven very\r\nthick, and almost close together, the same being as black as pitch or\r\ncoal, and many of them rotten as earth, which proveth that the ground\r\nthere (as sundry other places of the city) have been a marish, or full\r\nof springs.\r\n\r\nOn the south side from Ludgate, before the wall of the city be fair\r\nbuilt houses to Fleet bridge, on the which bridge a cistern for receipt\r\nof spring water was made by the men of Fleet street, but the watercourse\r\nis decayed, and not restored.\r\n\r\nNext is Bride lane, and therein Bridewell, of old time the king’s house,\r\nfor the kings of this realm have been there lodged; and till the ninth\r\nof Henry III. the courts were kept in the king’s house, wheresoever he\r\nwas lodged, as may appear by ancient records, whereof I have seen many,\r\nbut for example set forth one in the Chapter of Towers and Castles.\r\n\r\nKing Henry VIII. built there a stately and beautiful house of new, for\r\nreceipt of the Emperor Charles V., who, in the year of Christ 1522, was\r\nlodged himself at the Blacke Friers, but his nobles in this new built\r\nBridewell, a gallery being made out of the house over the water, and\r\nthrough the wall of the city, into the emperor’s lodging at the Blacke\r\nFriers. King Henry himself oftentimes lodged there also, as, namely,\r\nin the year 1525, a parliament being then holden in the Black Friers,\r\nhe created estates of nobility there, to wit, Henry Fitz Roy, a child\r\n(which he had by Elizabeth Blunt) to be Earl of Nottingham, Duke of\r\nRichmond and of Somerset, Lieutenant General from Trent northward,\r\nWarden of the East, Middle, and West Marches for anenst Scotland; Henry\r\nCourtney, Earl of Devonshire, cousin-german to the king, to be marquis\r\nof Exeter; Henry Brandon a child of two years old, son to the Earl of\r\nSuffolke, to be Earl of Lincolne; Sir Thomas Mannars, Lord Rose, to\r\nbe Earl of Rutland; Sir Henry Clifford, to be Earl of Cumberland; Sir\r\nRobert Ratcliffe, to be Viscount Fitzwater; and Sir Thomas Boloine,\r\ntreasurer of the king’s household, to be Viscount Rochford.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1528, Cardinal Campeius was brought to the king’s presence,\r\nbeing then at Bridewell, whither he had called all his nobility, judges,\r\nand councillors, etc. And there, the 8th of November, in his great\r\nchamber, he made unto them an oration touching his marriage with Queen\r\nKatherine, as ye may read in Edward Hall.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1529, the same King Henry and Queen Katherine were lodged\r\nthere, whilst the question of their marriage was argued in the Blacke\r\nFriers, etc.\r\n\r\nBut now you shall hear how this house became a house of correction. In\r\nthe year 1553, the 7th of King Edward VI., the 10th of April, Sir George\r\nBaron, being mayor of this city, was sent for to the court at Whitehall,\r\nand there at that time the king gave unto him for the commonalty and\r\ncitizens to be a workhouse for the poor and idle persons of the city,\r\nhis house of Bridewell, and seven hundred marks land, late of the\r\npossessions of the house of the Savoy, and all the bedding and other\r\nfurniture of the said hospital of the Savoy, towards the maintenance\r\nof the said workhouse of Bridewell, and the hospital of St. Thomas in\r\nSouthwark.\r\n\r\nThis gift King Edward confirmed by his charter, dated the 26th of June\r\nnext following; and in the year 1555, in the month of February, Sir\r\nWilliam Gerarde, mayor, and the aldermen entered Bridewell, and took\r\npossession thereof according to the gift of the said King Edward, the\r\nsame being confirmed by Queen Mary.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of St. David’s had his inn over against the north side of\r\nthis Bridwell, as I have said.\r\n\r\nThen is the parish church of St. Bridges, or Bride, of old time a small\r\nthing, which now remaineth to be the choir, but since increased with a\r\nlarge body and side aisles towards the west, at the charges of William\r\nVenor, esquire, warden of the Fleet, about the year 1480, all which he\r\ncaused to be wrought about in the stone in the figure of a vine with\r\ngrapes, and leaves, etc. The partition betwixt the old work and the new,\r\nsometime prepared as a screen to be set up in the hall of the Duke of\r\nSomerset’s house at Strand, was brought for eight score pounds, and set\r\nup in the year 1557; one wilful body began to spoil and break the same\r\nin the year 1596, but was by the high commissioners forced to make it up\r\nagain, and so it resteth. John Ulsthorpe, William Evesham, John Wigan,\r\nand other, found chantries there.\r\n\r\nThe next is Salisburie court, a place so called for that it belonged to\r\nthe Bishops of Salisburie, and was their inn, or London house, at such\r\ntime as they were summoned to come to the parliament, or came for other\r\nbusiness; it hath of late time been the dwelling, first of Sir Richard\r\nSackvile, and now of Sir Thomas Sackvile his son, Baron of Buckhurst,\r\nLord Treasurer, who hath lately enlarged it with stately buildings.\r\n\r\nThen is Water lane, running down, by the west side of a house called the\r\nHanging Sword, to the Thames.\r\n\r\nThen was the White Friers’ church, called _Fratres beatæ Mariæ de Monte\r\nCarmeli_, first founded (saith John Bale) by Sir Richard Gray, knight,\r\nancestor to the Lord Gray Codnor, in the year 1241. King Edward I.\r\ngave to the prior and brethren of that house a plot of ground in Fleet\r\nstreet, whereupon to build their house, which was since re-edified or\r\nnew built, by Hugh Courtney, Earl of Devonshire, about the year 1350,\r\nthe 24th of Edward III. John Lutken, mayor of London, and the commonalty\r\nof the city, granted a lane called Crockers lane, reaching from Fleet\r\nstreet to the Thames, to build in the west end of that church. Sir\r\nRobert Knoles, knight, was a great builder there also, in the reign\r\nof Richard II., and of Henry IV.; he deceased at his manor of Scone\r\nThorpe, in Norffolke, in the year 1407, and was brought to London, and\r\nhonourably buried by the Lady Constance his wife, in the body of the\r\nsaid White Friers’ church, which he had newly built.\r\n\r\nRobert Marshall, Bishop of Hereford, built the choir, presbytery,\r\nsteeple, and many other parts, and was there buried, about the year\r\n1420. There were buried also in the new choir, Sir John Mowbery, Earl\r\nof Nottingham, 1398; Sir Edwarde Cortney; Sir Hugh Montgomerie, and Sir\r\nJohn his brother; John Wolle, son to Sir John Wolle; Thomas Bayholt,\r\nesquire; Elizabeth, Countess of Athole; Dame Johan, wife to Sir Thomas\r\nSay of Alden; Sir Pence Castle, Baron; John, Lord Gray, son to Reginald,\r\nLord Gray of Wilton, 1418; Sir John Ludlow, knight; Sir Richard Derois,\r\nknight; Richarde Gray, knight; John Ashley, knight; Robert Bristow,\r\nesquire; Thomas Perry, esquire; Robert Tempest, esquire; William Call;\r\nWilliam Neddow.\r\n\r\nIn the old choir were buried: Dame Margaret, etc.; Eleanor Gristles; Sir\r\nJohn Browne, knight, and John his son and heir; Sir Simon de Berforde,\r\nknight; Peter Wigus, esquire; Robert Mathew, esquire; Sir John Skargell,\r\nknight; Sir John Norice, knight; Sir Geffrey Roose, knight; Mathew\r\nHadocke, esquire; William Clarell, esquire; John Aprichard, esquire;\r\nWilliam Wentworth, esquire; Thomas Wicham, esquire; Sir Terwit, knight;\r\nSir Stephen Popham, knight; Bastard de Scales; Henrie Blunt, esquire;\r\nElizabeth Blunt; John Swan, esquire; Alice Foster, one of the heirs of\r\nSir Stephen Popham; Sir Robert Brocket, knight; John Drayton, esquire;\r\nJohn, son to Robert Chanlowes, and his daughter Katherine; John Salvin,\r\nWilliam Hampton, John Bampton, John Winter, Edmond Oldhall, William\r\nAppleyard, Thomas Dabby, esquires; Sir Hugh Courtney, knight; John\r\nDrury, son to Robert Drurie; Elizabeth Gemersey, gentlewoman; Sir Thomas\r\nTownsend, knight; Sir Richarde Greene, knight; William Scot, esquire;\r\nThomas Federinghey, I. Fulforde, esquire; Edward Eldsmere, gentleman;\r\nW. Hart, gentleman; Dame Mary Senclare, daughter to Sir Thomas Talbot,\r\nknight; Ancher, esquire; Sir William Moris, knight, and Dame Christian\r\nhis wife; Sir Peter de Mota, knight; Richard Hewton, esquire; Sir I.\r\nHeron, knight; Richard Eton, esquire; Hugh Stapleton, gentleman; William\r\nCopley, gentleman; Sir Ralph Saintowen, knight; Sir Hugh Bromeflete,\r\nknight; Lord Vessey, principal founder of that order, the 6th of Edward\r\nIV., etc.\r\n\r\nThis house was valued at £62 7_s._ 3_d._, and was surrendered the 10th\r\nof November, the 30th of Henry VIII.\r\n\r\nIn place of this Friers’ church be now many fair houses built, lodgings\r\nfor noblemen and others.\r\n\r\nThen is the Sargeants’ inn, so called, for that divers judges and\r\nsargeants at the law keep a commons, and are lodged there in term time.\r\n\r\nNext is the New Temple, so called because the Templars, before the\r\nbuilding of this house, had their Temple in Oldborne. This house was\r\nfounded by the Knights Templars in England, in the reign of Henry II.,\r\nand the same was dedicated to God and our blessed Lady, by Heraclius,\r\nPatriarch of the church called the Holy Resurrection, in Jerusalem, in\r\nthe year of Christ, 1185.\r\n\r\nThese Knights Templars took their beginning about the year 1118, in\r\nmanner following. Certain noblemen, horsemen, religiously bent, bound\r\nby vow themselves in the hands of the Patriarch of Jerusalem, to serve\r\nChrist after the manner of regular canons in chastity and obedience, and\r\nto renounce their own proper wills for ever; the first of which order\r\nwere Hugh Paganus, and Geffrey de S. Andromare. And whereas at the first\r\nthey had no certain habitation, Baldwin, king of Jerusalem, granted unto\r\nthem a dwelling place in his palace by the Temple, and the canons of the\r\nsame Temple gave them the street thereby to build therein their houses\r\nof office, and the patriarch, the king, the nobles, and prelates gave\r\nunto them certain revenues out of their lordships.\r\n\r\nTheir first profession was for safeguard of the pilgrims coming to\r\nvisit the sepulchre, and to keep the highways against the lying in wait\r\nof thieves, etc. About ten years after they had a rule appointed unto\r\nthem, and a white habit, by Honorius II. then Pope; and whereas they\r\nhad but nine in number, they began to increase greatly. Afterward, in\r\nPope Eugenius’ time, they bare crosses of red cloth on their uppermost\r\ngarments, to be known from others; and in short time, because they had\r\ntheir first mansion hard by the Temple of our Lord in Jerusalem, they\r\nwere called Knights of the Temple.\r\n\r\nMany noble men in all parts of Christendom became brethren of this\r\norder, and built for themselves temples in every city or great town in\r\nEngland, but this at London was their chief house, which they built\r\nafter the form of the temple near to the sepulchre of our Lord at\r\nJerusalem; they had also other temples in Cambridge,[269] Bristow,\r\nCanterbury, Dover, Warwick.[270] This Temple in London, was often made a\r\nstorehouse of men’s treasure, I mean such as feared the spoil thereof in\r\nother places.\r\n\r\nMatthew Paris noteth, that in the year 1232, Hubert de Burgh, Earl of\r\nKent, being prisoner in the Tower of London, the king was informed that\r\nhe had much treasure laid up in this New Temple, under the custody\r\nof the Templars; whereupon he sent for the master of the Temple, and\r\nexamined him straitly, who confessed that money being delivered unto him\r\nand his brethren to be kept, he knew not how much there was of it; the\r\nking demanded to have the same delivered, but it was answered, that the\r\nmoney being committed unto their trust, could not be delivered without\r\nthe licence of him that committed it to ecclesiastical protection,\r\nwhereupon the king sent his Treasurer and Justiciar of the Exchequer\r\nunto Hubert, to require him to resign the money wholly into his hands,\r\nwho answered that he would gladly submit himself, and all his, unto the\r\nking’s pleasure; and thereupon desired the knights of the Temple, in his\r\nbehalf, to present all the keys unto the king, to do his pleasure with\r\nthe goods which he had committed unto them. Then the king commanded the\r\nmoney to be faithfully told and laid up in his treasury, by inventory,\r\nwherein was found (besides ready money) vessels of gold and silver\r\nunpriceable, and many precious stones, which would make all men wonder\r\nif they knew the worth of them.\r\n\r\nThis Temple was again dedicated 1240, belike also newly re-edified then.\r\n\r\nThese Templars at this time were in so great glory, that they\r\nentertained the nobility, foreign ambassadors, and the prince himself\r\nvery often, insomuch that Matthew Paris crieth out on them for their\r\npride, who being at the first so poor, as they had but one horse to\r\nserve two of them (in token whereof they gave in their seal two men\r\nriding of one horse), yet suddenly they waxed so insolent, that they\r\ndisdained other orders, and sorted themselves with noblemen.\r\n\r\nKing Edward I. in the year 1283, taking with him Robert Waleran, and\r\nother, came to the Temple, where calling for the keeper of the treasure\r\nhouse, as if he meant to see his mother’s-jewels, that were laid up\r\nthere to be safely kept, he entered into the house, breaking the coffers\r\nof certain persons that had likewise brought their money thither, and he\r\ntook away from thence to the value of a thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nMany parliaments and great councils have been there kept, as may appear\r\nby our histories. In the year 1308, all the Templars in England, as also\r\nin other parts of Christendom, were apprehended and committed to divers\r\nprisons. In 1310, a provincial council was holden at London, against the\r\nTemplars in England, upon heresy and other articles whereof they were\r\naccused, but denied all except one or two of them, notwithstanding they\r\nall did confess that they could not purge themselves fully as faultless,\r\nand so they were condemned to perpetual penance in several monasteries,\r\nwhere they behaved themselves modestly.\r\n\r\nPhilip, king of France, procured their overthrow throughout the whole\r\nworld, and caused them to be condemned by a general council to his\r\nadvantage, as he thought, for he believed to have had all their lands\r\nin France, and, therefore, seized the same in his hands (as I have\r\nread), and caused the Templars to the number of four and fifty (or after\r\nFabian, threescore) to be burned at Paris.\r\n\r\nEdward II. in the year 1313, gave unto Aimer de Valence, Earl of\r\nPembroke, the whose place and houses called the New Temple at London,\r\nwith the ground called Ficquetes Croft, and all the tenements and rents,\r\nwith the appurtenances, that belonged to the Templars in the city of\r\nLondon and suburbs thereof.\r\n\r\nAfter Aimer de Valence (sayeth some) Hugh Spencer, usurping the same,\r\nheld it during his life, by whose death it came again to the hands of\r\nEdward III.; but in the meantime, to wit, 1324, by a council holden at\r\nVienna, all the lands of the Templars (lest the same should be put to\r\nprofane uses) were given to the knights hospitalers of the order of St.\r\nJohn Baptist, called St. John of Jerusalem, which knights had put the\r\nTurkes out of the Isle of Rhodes, and after won upon the said Turkes\r\ndaily for a long time.\r\n\r\nThe said Edward III., therefore, granted the same to the said knights,\r\nwho possessed it, and in the eighteenth year of the said king’s reign,\r\nwere forced to repair the bridge of the said Temple. These knights had\r\ntheir head house for England by West Smithfield, and they in the reign\r\nof the same Edward III. granted (for a certain rent of ten pounds by the\r\nyear) the said Temple, with the appurtenances thereunto adjoining, to\r\nthe students of the common laws of England, in whose possession the same\r\nhath ever since remained; and is now divided into two houses of several\r\nstudents, by the same of inns of court, to wit, the Inner Temple, and\r\nthe Middle Temple, who kept two several halls, but they resort all to\r\nthe said Temple church, in the round walk whereof (which is the west\r\npart without the choir) there remaineth monuments of noblemen buried, to\r\nthe number of eleven, eight of them are images of armed knights, five\r\nlying cross-legged as men vowed to the Holy Land, against the infidels\r\nand unbelieving Jews; the other three straight-legged; the rest are\r\ncoped stones all of grey marble; the first of the cross-legged was W.\r\nMarshall, the elder Earl of Pembroke, who died 1219; Will. Marshall\r\nhis son, Earl of Pembroke, was the second, he died, 1231; and Gilbert\r\nMarshall his brother, Earl of Pembroke, slain in a tournament at\r\nHertford, beside Ware, in the year 1241.\r\n\r\nAfter this Robert Rose, otherwise called Fursan, being made a Templar in\r\nthe year 1245, died and was buried there, and these are all that I can\r\nremember to have read of. Sir Nicholas Hare, Master of the Rolls, was\r\nburied there in the year 1557.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1381, the rebels of Essex and of Kent destroyed and plucked\r\ndown the houses and lodgings of this Temple, took out of the church the\r\nbooks and records that were in hutches of the apprentices of the law,\r\ncarried them into the streets, and burnt them; the house they spoiled\r\nand burnt for wrath that they bare Sir Robert Halles, Lord-prior of St.\r\nJohn’s in Smithfield; but it was since again at divers times repaired,\r\nnamely, the gate-house of the Middle Temple, in the reign of Henry\r\nVIII., by Sir Amias Paulet, knight, upon occasion, as in my _Annales_ I\r\nhave shown. The great hall of the Middle Temple was newly built in the\r\nyear 1572, in the reign of our Queen Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nThis Temple church hath a master and four stipendiary priests, with a\r\nclerk: these for the ministration of Divine service there have stipends\r\nallowed unto them out of the possessions and revenues of the late\r\nhospital and house of St. John’s of Jerusalem in England, as it had\r\nbeen in the reign of Edward VI.; and thus much for the said new Temple,\r\nthe farthest west part of this ward, and also of this city for the\r\nliberties thereof; which ward hath an alderman, and his deputies three.\r\nIn Sepulchre’s parish, common council six, constables four, scavengers\r\nfour, wardmote inquest twelve; St. Bridgetes parish, common councillors\r\neight, constables eight, scavengers eight, wardmote inquest twenty; in\r\nSt. Andrewes, common council two, constables two, scavengers three,\r\nwardmote inquest twelve. It is taxed to the fifteen at thirty-five\r\npounds one shilling.[271]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[264] With the following inscription: “_Hic jacet Raherus primus\r\ncanonicus, et primus prior istius Ecclesiæ_.”\r\n\r\n[265] “The forrens were licensed for three dayes; the freemen so long as\r\nthey would, which was sixe or seven dayes.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\n[266] “John Davy, a false accuser of his master, of him was raised the\r\nby-word,--If ye serve me so, I will call you Davy.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\n[267] “Commonly called Ely place.”--_1st edition_, p. 323.\r\n\r\n[268] Fewters, idle people, probably from the old French _Fautier_,\r\nwhich Roquefort, _Glossaire de la Langue Romane_, defines “_Criminel\r\nCoupable_,” or from _Fautteur_, “_rempli de défauts et de mauvaises\r\nhabitudes_.”\r\n\r\n[269] Matthew Paris.\r\n\r\n[270] “And others in other places.”--_1st edition_, p. 325.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIDGE WARDE WITHOUT, THE TWENTY-SIXTH IN NUMBER; CONSISTING OF THE\r\nBOROUGH OF SOUTHWARKE, IN THE COUNTY OF SURREY.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving treated of wards in London, on the north side of the Thames (in\r\nnumber twenty-five), I am now to cross over the said river into the\r\nborough of Southwark, which is also a ward of London without the walls,\r\non the south side thereof, as is Portsoken on the east, and Farringdon\r\nextra on the west.\r\n\r\nThis borough being in the county of Surrey, consisteth of divers\r\nstreets, ways, and winding lanes, all full of buildings, inhabited; and,\r\nfirst, to begin at the west part thereof, over against the west suburb\r\nof the city.\r\n\r\nOn the bank of the river Thames there is now a continual building of\r\ntenements, about half a mile in length to the bridge. Then from the\r\nbridge, straight towards the south, a continual street, called Long\r\nSouthwark, built on both sides with divers lanes and alleys up to St.\r\nGeorge’s church, and beyond it through Blackman street towards New\r\ntown (or Newington); the liberties of which borough extend almost to\r\nthe parish church of New town aforesaid, distant one mile from London\r\nBridge, and also south-west a continual building almost to Lambeth, more\r\nthan one mile from the said bridge.\r\n\r\nThen from the bridge along by the Thames eastward is St. Olave’s street,\r\nhaving continual building on both the sides, with lanes and alleys, up\r\nto Battle bridge, to Horsedowne, and towards Rother hithe; also some\r\ngood half mile in length from London Bridge.\r\n\r\nSo that I account the whole continual buildings on the bank of the said\r\nriver, from the west towards the east, to be more than a large mile in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nThen have ye, from the entering towards the said Horsedown, one other\r\ncontinual street called Bermondes high street, which stretcheth south,\r\nlikewise furnished with buildings on both sides, almost half a mile\r\nin length, up to the late dissolved monastery of St. Saviour called\r\nBermondsey. And from thence is one Long lane (so called of the length),\r\nturning west to St. George’s church afore named. Out of the which lane\r\nmentioned Long lane breaketh one other street towards the south and by\r\neast, and this is called Kentish street, for that is the way leading\r\ninto that country: and so have you the bounds of this borough.\r\n\r\nThe antiquities most notable in this borough are these: First, for\r\necclesiastical, there was Bermondsey, an abbey of black monks, St. Mary\r\nOveries, a priory of canons regular, St. Thomas, a college or hospital\r\nfor the poor, and the Loke, a lazar house in Kent street. Parish\r\nchurches there have been six, whereof five do remain; viz., St. Mary\r\nMagdalen, in the priory of St. Mary Overy, now the same St. Mary Overy\r\nis the parish church for the said Mary Magdalen, and for St. Margaret on\r\nthe hill, and is called St. Saviour.\r\n\r\nSt. Margaret on the hill being put down is now a court for justice;\r\nSt. Thomas in the hospital serveth for a parish church as before; St.\r\nGeorge a parish church as before it did; so doth St. Olave and St. Mary\r\nMagdalen, by the abbey of Bermondsey.\r\n\r\nThere be also these five prisons or gaols:\r\n\r\n    The Clinke on the Banke.\r\n    The Compter, in the late parish church of St. Margaret.\r\n    The Marshalsey.\r\n    The Kinges Bench.\r\n    And the White Lion, all in Long Southwarke.\r\n\r\nHouses most notable be these:\r\n\r\n    The Bishop of Winchester’s house.\r\n    The Bishop of Rochester’s house.\r\n    The Duke of Suffolk’s house, or Southwark place.\r\n    The Tabard, an hostery or inn.\r\n    The Abbot of Hyde, his house.\r\n    The Prior of Lewes, his house.\r\n    The Abbot of St. Augustine, his house.\r\n    The Bridge house.\r\n    The Abbot of Battaile, his house.\r\n    Battaile bridge.\r\n    The Stewes on the bank of Thames.\r\n    And the Bear gardens there.\r\n\r\nNow, to return to the west bank, there be two bear gardens, the old\r\nand new places, wherein be kept bears, bulls, and other beasts, to be\r\nbaited; as also mastiffs in several kennels, nourished to bait them.\r\nThese bears and other beasts are there baited in plots of ground,\r\nscaffolded about for the beholders to stand safe.\r\n\r\nNext on this bank was sometime the Bordello, or Stewes, a place so\r\ncalled of certain stew-houses privileged there, for the repair of\r\nincontinent men to the like women; of the which privilege I have read\r\nthus:\r\n\r\nIn a parliament holden at Westminster, the 8th of Henry II., it was\r\nordained by the commons, and confirmed by the king and lords, that\r\ndivers constitutions for ever should be kept within that lordship or\r\nfranchise, according to the old customs that had been there used time\r\nout of mind: amongst the which these following were some, viz.\r\n\r\n“That no stew-holder or his wife should let or stay any single woman, to\r\ngo and come freely at all times when they listed.\r\n\r\n“No stew-holder to keep any woman to board, but she to board abroad at\r\nher pleasure.\r\n\r\n“To take no more for the woman’s chamber in the week than fourteen pence.\r\n\r\n“Not to keep open his doors upon the holidays.\r\n\r\n“Not to keep any single woman in his house on the holidays, but the\r\nbailiff to see them voided out of the lordship.\r\n\r\n“No single woman to be kept against her will that would leave her sin.\r\n\r\n“No stew-holder to receive any woman of religion, or any man’s wife.\r\n\r\n“No single woman to take money to lie with any man, but she lie with him\r\nall night till the morrow.\r\n\r\n“No man to be drawn or enticed into any stew-house.\r\n\r\n“The constables, bailiff, and others, every week to search every\r\nstew-house.\r\n\r\n“No stew-holder to keep any woman that hath the perilous infirmity\r\nof burning, not to sell bread, ale, flesh, fish, wood, coal, or any\r\nvictuals, etc.”\r\n\r\nThese and many more orders were to be observed upon great pain and\r\npunishment. I have also seen divers patents of confirmation, namely, one\r\ndated 1345, the 19th of Edward III.[272] Also I find, that in the 4th\r\nof Richard II., these stew-houses belonging to William Walworth, then\r\nmayor of London, were farmed by Froes of Flanders, and spoiled by Walter\r\nTyler, and other rebels of Kent: notwithstanding, I find that ordinances\r\nfor the same place and houses were again confirmed in the reign of Henry\r\nVI., to be continued as before. Also, Robert Fabian writeth, that in the\r\nyear 1506, the 21st of Henry VII., the said stew-houses in Southwarke\r\nwere for a season inhibited, and the doors closed up, but it was not\r\nlong (saith he) ere the houses there were set open again, so many as\r\nwere permitted, for (as it was said) whereas before were eighteen\r\nhouses, from thenceforth were appointed to be used but twelve only.\r\nThese allowed stew-houses had signs on their fronts, towards the Thames,\r\nnot hanged out, but painted on the walls, as a Boar’s head, the Cross\r\nkeys, the Gun, the Castle, the Crane, the Cardinal’s hat, the Bell,\r\nthe Swan, etc. I have heard of ancient men, of good credit, report,\r\nthat these single women were forbidden the rites of the church, so long\r\nas they continued that sinful life, and were excluded from Christian\r\nburial, if they were not reconciled before their death. And therefore\r\nthere was a plot of ground called the Single Woman’s churchyard,\r\nappointed for them far from the parish church.\r\n\r\nIn the year of Christ 1546, the 37th of Henry VIII., this row of\r\nstews in Southwarke was put down by the king’s commandment, which was\r\nproclaimed by sound of trumpet, no more to be privileged, and used as a\r\ncommon brothel, but the inhabitants of the same to keep good and honest\r\nrule as in other places of this realm, etc.\r\n\r\nThen next is the Clinke, a gaol or prison for the trespassers in those\r\nparts; namely, in old time, for such as should brabble, frey, or break\r\nthe peace on the said bank, or in the brothel houses, they were by the\r\ninhabitants thereabout apprehended and committed to this gaol, where\r\nthey were straitly imprisoned.\r\n\r\nNext is the bishop of Winchester’s house, or lodging, when he cometh to\r\nthis city; which house was first built by William Gifford, bishop of\r\nWinchester, about the year 1107, the 7th of Henry I., upon a plot of\r\nground pertaining to the prior of Bermondsey, as appeareth by a writ\r\ndirected unto the barons of the Exchequer, in the year 1366, the 41st of\r\nEdward III. (the bishop’s see being void), for eight pounds, due to the\r\nmonks of Bermondsey for the bishop of Winchester’s lodging in Southwark.\r\nThis is a very fair house, well repaired, and hath a large wharf and\r\nlanding-place, called the bishop of Winchester’s stairs.\r\n\r\nAdjoining to this, on the south side the roof, is the bishop of\r\nRochester’s inn or lodging, by whom first erected I do not now remember\r\nme to have read; but well I wot the same of long time hath not been\r\nfrequented by any bishop, and lieth ruinous for any lack of reparations.\r\nThe abbot of Maverley had a house there.\r\n\r\nEast from the bishop of Winchester’s house, directly over against it,\r\nstandeth a fair church called St. Mary over the Rie, or Overie, that\r\nis over the water. This church, or some other in place thereof, was\r\nof old time, long before the Conquest, a house of sisters, founded by\r\na maiden named Mary; unto the which house and sisters she left (as\r\nwas left to her by her parents) the oversight and profits of a cross\r\nferry, or traverse ferry over the Thames, there kept before that any\r\nbridge was built. This house of sisters was after by Swithen, a noble\r\nlady, converted into a college of priests, who in place of the ferry\r\nbuilt a bridge of timber, and from time to time kept the same in good\r\nreparations, but lastly the same bridge was built of stone; and then\r\nin the year 1106 was this church again founded for canons regulars by\r\nWilliam Pont de la Arche and William Dauncy, knights, Normans.\r\n\r\nWilliam Gifford, bishop of Winchester, was a good benefactor also, for\r\nhe, as some have noted, built the body of that church in the year 1106,\r\nthe 7th of Henry I.\r\n\r\nThe canons first entered the said church then; Algodus was the first\r\nprior.\r\n\r\nKing Henry I. by his charter gave them the church of St. Margaret in\r\nSouthwarke.\r\n\r\nKing Stephen confirmed the gift of King Henry, and also gave the\r\nstone-house, which was William Pont de le Arche’s, by Downegate.\r\n\r\nThis priory was burnt about the year 1207, wherefore the canons did\r\nfound a hospital near unto their priory, where they celebrated until the\r\npriory was repaired; which hospital was after, by consent of Peter de la\r\nRoch, bishop of Winchester, removed into the land of Anicius, archdeacon\r\nof Surrey, in the year 1228, a place where the water was more plentiful,\r\nand the air more wholesome, and was dedicated to St. Thomas.\r\n\r\nThis Peter de Rupibus, or de la Roch, founded a large chapel of St. Mary\r\nMagdalen, in the said church of St. Mary Overie; which chapel was after\r\nappointed to be the parish church for the inhabitants near adjoining.\r\n\r\nThis church was again newly built in the reign of Richard II. and King\r\nHenry IV.\r\n\r\nJohn Gower, esquire, a famous poet,[273] was then an especial benefactor\r\nto that work, and was there buried on the north side of the said church,\r\nin the chapel of St. John, where he founded a chantry: he lieth under a\r\ntomb of stone, with his image, also of stone, over him: the hair of his\r\nhead, auburn, long to his shoulders, but curling up, and a small forked\r\nbeard; on his head a chaplet, like a coronet of four roses; a habit of\r\npurple, damasked down to his feet; a collar of esses gold about his\r\nneck; under his head the likeness of three books, which he compiled. The\r\nfirst, named _Speculum Meditantis_, written in French; the second, _Vox\r\nClamantis_, penned in Latin; the third, _Confessio Amantis_, written in\r\nEnglish, and this last is printed. _Vox Clamantis_, with his _Cronica\r\nTripartita_, and other, both in Latin and French, never printed, I have\r\nand do possess, but _Speculum Meditantis_ I never saw, though heard\r\nthereof to be in Kent. Beside on the wall where he lieth, there was\r\npainted three virgins crowned; one of the which was named Charity,\r\nholding this device:\r\n\r\n    “En toy qui es Fitz de dieu le pere,\r\n    Sauve soit, que gist souz cest piere.”\r\n\r\nThe second writing, Mercy, with this device:\r\n\r\n    “O bone Jesu, fait ta mercie,\r\n    Al alme, dont le corps gist icy.”\r\n\r\nThe third writing, Pity, with this device:\r\n\r\n    “Pur ta pité Jesu regarde,\r\n    Et met cest alme en sauve garde.”\r\n\r\nHis arms a field argent, on a cheveron azure, three leopards’ heads\r\ngold, their tongues gules; two angels supporters, on the crest a talbot:\r\nhis epitaph,\r\n\r\n    “Armigeri scutum nihil a modo fert sibi tutum,\r\n    Reddidit immolutum morti generale tributum,\r\n    Spiritus exutum se gaudeat esse solutum,\r\n    Est ubi virtutum regnum sine labe statutum,”\r\n\r\nThe roof of the middle west aisle fell down in the year 1469. This\r\npriory was surrendered to Henry VIII., the 31st of his reign, the 27th\r\nof October, the year of Christ 1539, valued at £624 6_s._ 6_d._ by the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nAbout Christmas next following, the church of the said priory was\r\npurchased of the king by the inhabitants of the borough, Doctor Stephen\r\nGardner, bishop of Winchester, putting to his helping hand; they made\r\nthereof a parish church for the parish church of St. Mary Magdalen, on\r\nthe south side of the said choir, and of St. Margaret on the hill, which\r\nwere made one parish of St. Saviour.\r\n\r\nThere be monuments in this church,--of Robert Liliarde, or Hiliarde,\r\nesquire; Margaret, daughter to the Lady Audley, wife to Sir Thomas\r\nAudley; William Grevill, esquire, and Margaret his wife; one of the\r\nheirs of William Spershut, esquire; Dame Katherine, wife to John Stoke,\r\nalderman; Robert Merfin, esquire; William Undall, esquire; Lord Ospay\r\nFerar; Sir George Brewes, knight; John Browne; Lady Brandon, wife to\r\nSir Thomas Brandon; William, Lord Scales; William, Earl Warren; Dame\r\nMaude, wife to Sir John Peach; Lewknor; Dame Margaret Elrington, one\r\nof the heirs of Sir Thomas Elrington; John Bowden, esquire; Robert St.\r\nMagil; John Sandhurst; John Gower; John Duncell, merchant-tailor, 1516;\r\nJohn Sturton, esquire; Robert Rouse; Thomas Tong, first Norroy, and\r\nafter Clarenceaux king of arms; William Wickham, translated from the\r\nsee of Lincoln to the bishopric of Winchester in the month of March,\r\n1595, deceased the 11th of June next following, and was buried here;\r\nThomas Cure, esquire, saddler to King Edward VI., Queen Mary, and Queen\r\nElizabeth, deceased the 24th of May, 1598, etc.\r\n\r\nNow passing through St. Mary Over’s close (in possession of the Lord\r\nMountacute), and Pepper alley, into Long Southwark, on the right hand\r\nthereof the market-hill, where the leather is sold, there stood the late\r\nnamed parish church of St. Margaret, given to St. Mary Overies by Henry\r\nI., put down and joined with the parish of St. Mary Magdalen, and united\r\nto the late dissolved priory church of St. Mary Overy.\r\n\r\nA part of this parish church of St. Margaret is now a court, wherein the\r\nassizes and sessions be kept, and the court of admiralty is also there\r\nkept. One other part of the same church is now a prison, called the\r\nCompter in Southwark, etc.\r\n\r\nFarther up on that side, almost directly over against St. George’s\r\nchurch, was sometime a large and most sumptuous house, built by Charles\r\nBrandon, late Duke of Suffolk, in the reign of Henry VIII., which was\r\ncalled Suffolk house, but coming afterwards into the king’s hands, the\r\nsame was called Southwarke place, and a mint of coinage was there kept\r\nfor the king.\r\n\r\nTo this place came King Edward VI., in the second of his reign, from\r\nHampton Court, and dined in it. He at that time made John Yorke, one\r\nof the sheriffs of London, knight, and then rode through the city to\r\nWestminster.\r\n\r\nQueen Mary gave this house to Nicholas Heath, Archbishop of Yorke, and\r\nto his successors, for ever, to be their inn or lodging for their repair\r\nto London, in recompense of Yorke house near to Westminster, which King\r\nHenry her father had taken from Cardinal Wolsey, and from the see of\r\nYorke.\r\n\r\nArchbishop Heath sold the same house to a merchant, or to merchants,\r\nthat pulled it down, sold the lead, stone, iron, etc.; and in place\r\nthereof built many small cottages of great rents, to the increasing\r\nof beggars in that borough. The archbishop bought Norwich house, or\r\nSuffolke place, near unto Charing cross, because it was near unto the\r\ncourt, and left it to his successors.\r\n\r\nNow on the south side to return back again towards the bridge, over\r\nagainst this Suffolke place, is the parish church of St. George,\r\nsometime pertaining to the priory of Barmondsey, by the gift of Thomas\r\nArderne and Thomas his son, in the year 1122. There lie buried in this\r\nchurch, William Kirton, esquire, and his wives, 1464.\r\n\r\nThen is the White Lion, a gaol so called, for that the same was a common\r\nhosterie for the receipt of travellers by that sign. This house was\r\nfirst used as a gaol within these forty years last, since the which time\r\nthe prisoners were once removed thence to a house in Newtowne, where\r\nthey remained for a short time, and were returned back again to the\r\nforesaid White Lion, there to remain as in the appointed gaol for the\r\ncounty of Surrey.\r\n\r\nNext is the gaol or prison of the King’s Bench, but of what antiquity\r\nthe same is I know not. For I have read that the courts of the King’s\r\nBench and Chancery have ofttimes been removed from London to other\r\nplaces, and so hath likewise the gaols that serve those courts; as in\r\nthe year 1304, Edward I. commanded the courts of the King’s Bench and\r\nthe Exchequer, which had remained seven years at Yorke, to be removed to\r\ntheir old places at London. And in the year 1387, the 11th of Richard\r\nII., Robert Tresilian, chief justice, came to the city of Coventrie, and\r\nthere sate by the space of a month, as justice of the Kinge’s benches,\r\nand caused to be indited in that court, about the number of two thousand\r\npersons of that country, etc.\r\n\r\nIt seemeth, therefore, that for that time, the prison or gaol of that\r\ncourt was not far off. Also in the year 1392, the 16th of the same\r\nRichard, the Archbishop of York being Lord Chancellor, for good will\r\nthat he bare to his city, caused the King’s Bench and Chancery to be\r\nremoved from London to York, but ere long they were returned to London.\r\n\r\nThen is the Marshalsey, another gaol or prison, so called, as pertaining\r\nto the marshals of England. Of what continuance kept in Southwark I have\r\nnot learned; but like it is, that the same hath been removable, at the\r\npleasure of the marshals: for I find that in the year 1376, the 50th\r\nof Edward III., Henry Percie (being marshal) kept his prisoners in the\r\ncity of London, where having committed one John Prendergast, of Norwich,\r\ncontrary to the liberties of the city of London, the citizens, by\r\npersuasion of the Lord Fitzwalter their standard-bearer, took armour and\r\nran with great rage to the marshal’s inn, brake up the gates, brought\r\nout the prisoner, and conveyed him away, minding to have burnt the\r\nstocks in the midst of their city, but they first sought for Sir Henry\r\nPercy to have punished him, as I have noted in my _Annales_.\r\n\r\nMore about the feast of Easter next following, John, Duke of Lancaster,\r\nhaving caused all the whole navy of England to be gathered together at\r\nLondon: it chanced a certain esquire to kill one of the shipmen, which\r\nact the other shipmen taking in ill part, they brought their suit into\r\nthe king’s court of the Marshalsey, which then as chanced (saith mine\r\nauthor) was kept in Southwark: but when they perceived that court to be\r\nso favourable to the murderer, and further that the king’s warrant was\r\nalso gotten for his pardon, they in great fury ran to the house wherein\r\nthe murderer was imprisoned, brake into it, and brought forth the\r\nprisoner with his gyves on his legs, they thrust a knife to his heart,\r\nand sticked him as if he had been a dog; after this they tied a rope\r\nto his gyves, and drew him to the gallows, where when they had hanged\r\nhim, as though they had done a great act, they caused the trumpets to\r\nbe sounded before them to their ships, and there in great triumph they\r\nspent the rest of the day.\r\n\r\nAlso the rebels of Kent, in the year 1381, brake down the houses of\r\nthe Marshalsey and King’s Bench in Southwark, took from thence the\r\nprisoners, brake down the house of Sir John Immorth, then marshal of the\r\nMarshalsey and King’s Bench, etc. After this, in the year 1387, the 11th\r\nof Richard II., the morrow after Bartholomew day, the king kept a great\r\ncouncil in the castle of Nottingham, and the Marshalsey of the king was\r\nthen kept at Loughborrow by the space of five days or more. In the year\r\n1443, Sir Walter Manny was marshal of the Marshalsey, the 22nd of Henry\r\nVI. William Brandon, esquire, was marshal in the 8th of Edward IV. In\r\nthe year 1504 the prisoners of the Marshalsey, then in Southwark, brake\r\nout, and many of them being taken were executed, especially such as had\r\nbeen committed for felony or treason.\r\n\r\nFrom thence towards London bridge, on the same side, be many fair inns,\r\nfor recepit of travellers, by these signs, the Spurre, Christopher,\r\nBull, Queene’s Head, Tabarde, George, Hart, Kinge’s Head, etc. Amongst\r\nthe which, the most ancient is the Tabard, so called of the sign, which,\r\nas we now term it, is of a jacket, or sleeveless coat, whole before,\r\nopen on both sides, with a square collar, winged at the shoulders; a\r\nstately garment of old time, commonly worn of noblemen and others, both\r\nat home and abroad in the wars, but then (to wit in the wars) their arms\r\nembroidered, or otherwise depict upon them, that every man by his coat\r\nof arms might be known from others: but now these tabards are only worn\r\nby the heralds, and be called their coats of arms in service; for the\r\ninn of the tabard, Geffrey Chaucer, esquire, the most famous poet of\r\nEngland, in commendation thereof, writeth thus:--\r\n\r\n    “Befell that in that season, on a day,\r\n    In Southwarke at the Tabard, as I lay,\r\n    Readie to wenden on my Pilgrimage\r\n    To Canterburie with devout courage,\r\n    At night was come into that hosterie,\r\n    Well nine-and-twentie in a companie,\r\n    Of sundrie folke, by adventure yfall,\r\n    In fellowship, and pilgrimes were they all,\r\n    That toward Canterburie woulden ride,\r\n    The chambers and the stables weren wide,\r\n    And well we weren eased at the best,” etc.\r\n\r\nWithin this inn was also the lodging of the abbot of Hide (by the city\r\nof Winchester), a fair house for him and his train, when he came to that\r\ncity to parliament, etc.\r\n\r\nAnd then Theeves lane, by St. Thomas’ hospital. The hospital of St.\r\nThomas, first founded by Richard Prior of Bermondsey, in the Selerers\r\nground against the wall of the monastery, in the year 1213, he named\r\nit the Almerie, or house of alms for converts and poor children; for\r\nthe which ground the prior ordained that the almoner should pay ten\r\nshillings and four pence yearly to the Selerer at Michaelmas.\r\n\r\nBut Peter de Rupibus,[274] Bishop of Winchester, in the year 1215,\r\nfounded the same again more fully for canons regular in place of the\r\nfirst hospital; he increased the rent thereof to three hundred and\r\nforty-four pounds in the year. Thus was this hospital holden of the\r\nprior and abbot of Bermondsey till the year 1428, at which time a\r\ncomposition was made between Thomas Thetford, abbot of Bermondsey, and\r\nNicholas Buckland, master of the said hospital of St. Thomas, for all\r\nthe lands and tenements which were holden of the said abbot and convent\r\nin Southwark, or elsewhere, for the old rent to be paid unto the said\r\nabbot.\r\n\r\nThere be monuments in this hospital church of Sir Robert Chamber,\r\nknight; William Fines, Lord Say; Richard Chaucer, John Gloucester,\r\nAdam Atwood, John Ward, Michael Cambridge, William West, John Golding,\r\nesquires; John Benham, George Kirkes, Thomas Kninton, Thomas Baker,\r\ngentlemen; Robert, son to Sir Thomas Fleming; Agnes, wife to Sir Walter\r\nDennis, knight, daughter, and one of the heirs of Sir Robert Danvars;\r\nJohn Evarey, gentleman; etc.\r\n\r\nThis hospital was by the visitors, in the year 1538, valued at two\r\nhundred and sixty-six pounds seventeen shillings and six pence, and was\r\nsurrendered to Henry VIII., in the 30th of his reign.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1552, the citizens of London having purchased the void\r\nsuppressed hospital of St. Thomas in Southwark, in the month of July\r\nbegan the reparations thereof, for poor, impotent, lame, and diseased\r\npeople, so that in the month of November next following, the sick and\r\npoor people were taken in. And in the year 1553, on the 10th of April,\r\nKing Edward VI., in the 7th of his reign, gave to the mayor, commonalty,\r\nand citizens of London, to be a workhouse for the poor and idle persons\r\nof this city, his house of Bridewell, and seven hundred marks land\r\nof the Savoy rents, which hospital he had suppressed, with all the\r\nbeds, bedding, and other furniture belonging to the same, towards the\r\nmaintenance of the said workhouse of Bridewell, and of this hospital of\r\nSt. Thomas in Southwark. This gift the king confirmed by his charter,\r\ndated the 26th of June next following, and willed it to be called the\r\nKing’s hospital in Southwark.\r\n\r\nThe church of this hospital, which of old time served for the tenements\r\nnear adjoining, and pertaining to the said hospital, remaineth as a\r\nparish church.\r\n\r\nBut now to come to St. Olave’s street. On the bank of the river of\r\nThames, is the parish church of St. Olave, a fair and meet large church,\r\nbut a far larger parish especially of aliens or strangers, and poor\r\npeople; in which church there lieth entombed Sir John Burcettur, knight,\r\n1466.\r\n\r\nOver against this parish church, on the south side the street was\r\nsometime one great house built of stone, with arched gates, pertaining\r\nto the prior of Lewes in Sussex, and was his lodging when he came to\r\nLondon; it is now a common hosterie for travellers, and hath to sign the\r\nWalnut Tree.\r\n\r\nThen east from the said parish church of St. Olave is a key. In the\r\nyear 1330, by the license of Simon Swanlond, mayor of London, built by\r\nIsabel, widow to Hamond Goodchepe. And next thereunto was then a great\r\nhouse of stone and timber, belonging to the abbot of St. Augustine\r\nwithout the walls of Canterburie, which was an ancient piece of work,\r\nand seemeth to be one of the first built houses on that side the river\r\nover-against the city; it was called the abbot’s inn of St. Augustine in\r\nSouthwark, and was sometime holden of the Earls of Warren and Surrey, as\r\nappeareth by a deed made 1281, which I have read, and may be Englished\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n“To all whom this present writing shall come, John Earl Warren sendeth\r\ngreeting. Know ye, that we have altogether remised and quit-claimed for\r\nus and our heirs for ever, to Nicholas, abbot of St. Augustine’s of\r\nCanterburie, and the convent of the same, and their successors, suit to\r\nour court of Southwarke, which they owe unto us, for all that messuage\r\nand houses thereon built, and all their appurtenances, which they have\r\nof our fee in Southwarke, situate upon the Thames, between the Bridge\r\nhouse and the church of St. Olave. And the said messuage, with the\r\nbuildings thereon built, and all their appurtenances, to them and their\r\nsuccessors, we have granted in perpetual alms, to hold of us and our\r\nheirs for the same, saving the service due to any other persons, if any\r\nsuch be, then to us; and for this remit and grant the said abbot and\r\nconvent have given unto us five shillings of rent yearly in Southwarke,\r\nand have received us and our heirs in all benefices which shall be in\r\ntheir church for ever.” This suit of court one William Graspeis was\r\nbound to do to the said earl for the said messuage, and heretofore to\r\nacquit in all things the church of St. Augustine against the said earl.\r\n\r\nThis house of late time belonged to Sir Anthony Sentlegar, then to\r\nWarham Sentlegar, etc., and is now called Sentlegar house, but divided\r\ninto sundry tenements. Next is the Bridgehouse, so called as being a\r\nstorehouse for stone, timber, or whatsoever pertaining to the building\r\nor repairing of London bridge.\r\n\r\nThis house seemeth to have taken beginning with the first founding of\r\nthe bridge either of stone or timber; it is a large plot of ground, on\r\nthe bank of the river Thames, containing divers large buildings for\r\nstowage of things necessary towards reparation of the said bridge.\r\n\r\nThere are also divers garners, for laying up of wheat, and other\r\ngrainers for service of the city, as need requireth. Moreover, there\r\nbe certain ovens built, in number ten, of which six be very large, the\r\nother four being but half so big. These were purposely made to bake out\r\nthe bread corn of the said grainers, to the best advantage for relief of\r\nthe poor citizens, when need should require. Sir John Throstone, knight,\r\nsometime an embroiderer, then a goldsmith, one of the sheriffs 1516,\r\ngave by his testament towards the making of these ovens, two hundred\r\npounds, which thing was performed by his executors. Sir John Munday,\r\ngoldsmith, then being mayor, there was of late, for the enlarging of the\r\nsaid Bridge house, taken in an old brewhouse, called Goldings, which\r\nwas given to the city by George Monex, sometime mayor, and in place\r\nthereof, is now a fair brewhouse new built, for service of the city with\r\nbeer.\r\n\r\nNext was the abbot of Battailes inn, betwixt the Bridge house and\r\nBattaile bridge, likewise on the bank of the river of Thames; the walks\r\nand gardens thereunto appertaining, on the other side of the way before\r\nthe gate of the said house, and was called the Maze; there is now an\r\ninn, called the Flower de Luce, for that the sign is three Flower de\r\nLuces. Much other buildings of small tenements are thereon builded,\r\nreplenished with strangers and other, for the most part poor people.\r\n\r\nThen is Battaile bridge, so called of Battaile abbey, for that it\r\nstandeth on the ground, and over a water-course (flowing out of Thames)\r\npertaining to that abbey, and was, therefore, both built and repaired by\r\nthe abbots of that house, as being hard adjoining to the abbot’s lodging.\r\n\r\nBeyond this bridge is Bermondsey street, turning south, in the south end\r\nwhereof was sometime a priory or abbey of St. Saviour, called Bermond’s\r\nEye in Southwark, founded by Alwin Childe, a citizen of London, in the\r\nyear 1081.\r\n\r\nPeter, Richard, Obstert, and Umbalde, monks de Charitate, came unto\r\nBermondsey, in the year 1089, and Peter was made first prior there, by\r\nappointment of the prior of the house, called Charity in France, by\r\nwhich means this priory of Bermondsey (being a cell to that in France)\r\nwas accounted a priory of Aliens.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1094 deceased Alwin Childe, founder of this house. Then\r\nWilliam Rufus gave to the monks his manor of Bermondsey, with the\r\nappurtenances, and built for them there a new great church.\r\n\r\nRobert Blewet, Bishop of Lincolne (King William’s chancellor), gave them\r\nthe manor of Charlton, with the appurtenances. Also Geffrey Martell, by\r\nthe grant of Geffrey Magnavile, gave them the land of Halingbury, and\r\nthe tithe of Alferton, etc.\r\n\r\nMore, in the year 1122, Thomas of Arderne, and Thomas his son, gave to\r\nthe monks of Bermond’s Eye the church of St. George in Southwark, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1165, King Henry II. confirmed to them the hyde or territory\r\nof Southwark, and Laygham Wadden, with the land of Coleman, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1371, the priors of Aliens, throughout England, being seized\r\ninto the king’s hands, Richard Denton an Englishman was made prior of\r\nBermondsey, to whom was committed the custody of the said priory, by the\r\nletters patents of King Edward III., saving to the king the advowsons of\r\nchurches.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1380, the 4th of Richard II., this priory was made a denison\r\n(or free English) for the fine of two hundred marks paid to the king’s\r\nHanaper in the Chancery. In the year 1399 John Attelborough, prior of\r\nBermondsey, was made the first abbot of that house by Pope Boniface IX.,\r\nat the suit of King Richard II.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1417, Thomas Thetford, abbot of Bermondsey, held a plea in\r\nchancery against the king, for the manors of Preston, Bermondsey, and\r\nStone, in the county of Somerset, in the which suit the abbot prevailed\r\nand recovered against the king.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1539 this abbey was valued to dispend by the year four\r\nhundred and seventy-four pounds fourteen shillings and four pence\r\nhalfpenny, and was surrendered to Henry VIII., the 31st of his reign;\r\nthe abbey church was then pulled down by Sir Thomas Pope, knight, and in\r\nplace thereof a goodly house built of stone and timber, now pertaining\r\nto the earls of Sussex.\r\n\r\nThere are buried in that church, Leoftane, provost, shrive or domesman\r\nof London, 1115; Sir William Bowes, knight, and Dame Elizabeth his wife;\r\nSir Thomas Pikeworth, knight; Dame Anne Audley; George, son to John Lord\r\nAudley; John Winkefield, esquire; Sir Nicholas Blonket, knight; Dame\r\nBridget, wife to William Trussell; Holgrave, baron of the exchequer; etc.\r\n\r\nNext unto this abbey church standeth a proper church of St. Mary\r\nMagdalen, built by the priors of Bermondsey, serving for resort of the\r\ninhabitants (tenants to the prior or abbots near adjoining) there to\r\nhave their Divine service: this church remaineth, and serveth as afore,\r\nand is called a parish church.\r\n\r\nThen in Kent street is a lazar house for leprous people, called the Loke\r\nin Southwark; the foundation whereof I find not. Now, having touched\r\ndivers principal parts of this borough, I am to speak somewhat of its\r\ngovernment, and so to end.\r\n\r\nThis borough, upon petition made by the citizens of London to Edward\r\nI., in the 1st year of his reign, was, for divers causes, by parliament\r\ngranted to them for ever, yielding into the exchequer the fee-firm of\r\nten pounds by the year; which grant was confirmed by Edward III., who,\r\nin the 3rd of his reign gave them license to take a toll towards the\r\ncharge of paving the said borough with stone. Henry IV. confirmed the\r\ngrant of his predecessors, so did Edward IV., etc.\r\n\r\nBut in the year 1550, King Edward VI., for the sum of six hundred and\r\nforty-seven pounds two shillings and one penny, paid into his court\r\nof augmentations and revenues of his crown, granted to the mayor\r\nand commonalty all his lands and tenements in Southwark, except, and\r\nreserved, the capital messuage, two mansions, called Southwark place,\r\nlate the Duke of Suffolk’s, and all the gardens and lands to the same\r\nappertaining, the park, and the messuage called the Antilope. Moreover,\r\nhe gave them the lordship and manor of Southwark, with all members and\r\nrights thereof, late pertaining to the monastery of Bermondsey. And\r\nall messuages, places, buildings, rents, courts, waifs and strays, to\r\nthe same appertaining, in the county of Surrey, except as is before\r\nexcepted. He also granted unto them his manor and borough of Southwark,\r\nwith all the members, rights, and appurtenances, late of the possession\r\nof the Archbishop of Canterbury and his see in Southwark. Moreover,\r\nfor the sum of five hundred marks, he granted to the said mayor and\r\ncommonalty, and their successors, in and through the borough and town of\r\nSouthwark, and in all the parishes of St. Saviour, St. Olave, and St.\r\nGeorge, and the parish of St. Thomas Hospital, now called the King’s\r\nhospital, and elsewhere, in the said town and borough of Southwark,\r\nand Kentish street, Bermondsey street, in the parish of Newington, all\r\nwaifs and strays, treasure trove, all felons’ goods, etc., within the\r\nparishes and precinct aforesaid, etc.: the return of writs, processes,\r\nand warrants, etc.: together with a fair in the whole town for three\r\ndays, to wit, the 7th, 8th, and 9th of September, yearly, with a court\r\nof pye powders. A view of franke pledge, with attachments, arrests, etc.\r\nAlso to arrest all felons, and other malefactors, within their precinct,\r\nand send them to ward, and to Newgate. Provided that nothing in that\r\ngrant should be prejudicial to the stewards and marshal of the king’s\r\nhouse. The same premises to be holden of the manor of East Greenwich, in\r\nthe county of Kent, by fealty in free forage. Dated at Westminster, the\r\n23rd of April, in the 4th of his reign. All which was also confirmed by\r\nparliament, etc. And the same year, in the Whitsun week, in a court of\r\naldermen, kept at the Guildhall of London, Sir John Aylophe, knight, was\r\nsworn the first alderman of Bridge ward without, and made up the number\r\nof twenty-six aldermen of London.\r\n\r\nThis borough at a subsidy to the king yieldeth about one thousand\r\nmarks, or eight hundred pounds, which is more than any one city in\r\nEngland payeth, except the city of London. And also the muster of men\r\nin this borough doth likewise in number surpass all other cities,\r\nexcept London. And thus much for the borough of Southwark, one of the\r\ntwenty-six wards of London, which hath an alderman, deputies three,\r\nand a bailiff, common-council none, constables sixteen, scavengers six,\r\nwardmote inquest twenty. And is taxed to the fifteen at seventeen pounds\r\nseventeen shillings and eight pence.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[271] “And in the Exchequer at thirty-four pounds.”--_1st edition_, p.\r\n338.\r\n\r\n[272] “Li. St. Mary Eborum. English people disdayned to be baudes. Froes\r\nof Flaunders were women for that purpose.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\n[273] “John Gower was no knight, neither had he any garland of ivie and\r\nroses, but a chaplet of foure roses onely.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\n[274] Li. St. Marie Overy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUBURBS WITHOUT THE WALLS OF THE SAID CITY BRIEFLY TOUCHED. AS ALSO\r\nWITHOUT THE LIBERTIES MORE AT LARGE DESCRIBED.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving spoken of this city, the original, and increase, by degrees: the\r\nwalls, gates, ditch, castles, towers, bridges, the schools, and houses\r\nof learning: of the orders and customs, sports, and pastimes: of the\r\nhonour of citizens, and worthiness of men: and last of all, how the same\r\ncity is divided into parts and wards: and how the same be bounded: and\r\nwhat monuments of antiquity, or ornaments of building, in every of them,\r\nas also in the borough of Southwark: I am next to speak briefly of the\r\nsuburbs, as well without the gates and walls as without the liberties,\r\nand of the monuments in them.\r\n\r\nConcerning the estate of the suburbs of this city, in the reign of Henry\r\nII., Fitz Stephen hath these words:--“Upwards, on the west (saith he),\r\nis the king’s palace, which is an incomparable building, rising with a\r\nvawmure and bulwark aloft upon the river, two miles from the wall of the\r\ncity, but yet conjoined with a continual suburb. On all sides, without\r\nthe houses of the suburbs, are the citizens’ gardens and orchards,\r\nplanted with trees, both large, sightly, and adjoining together. On\r\nthe north side are pastures and plain meadows, with brooks running\r\nthrough them, turning water-mills with a pleasant noise. Not far off\r\nis a great forest, a well wooded chase, having good covert for harts,\r\nbucks, does, boars, and wild bulls. The corn fields are not of a hungry\r\nsandy mould, but as the fruitful fields of Asia, yielding plentiful\r\nincrease, and filling the barns with corn. There are near London, on the\r\nnorth side, especial wells in the suburbs, sweet, wholesome, and clear.\r\nAmongst which, Holywell, Clarkenwell, and St. Clement’s well, are most\r\nfamous, and most frequented by scholars and youths of the city in summer\r\nevenings, when they walk forth to take the air.” Thus far out of Fitz\r\nStephen for the suburbs at that time.\r\n\r\nThe 2nd of King Henry III. the forest of Middlesex, and the warren of\r\nStaines, were disafforested; since the which time the suburbs about\r\nLondon hath been also mightily increased with buildings; for first,\r\nto begin in the East, by the Tower of London, is the hospital of St.\r\nKatherine, founded by Matilda the queen, wife to King Stephen, as is\r\nafore shown in Portsoken ward; from this precinct of St. Katherine to\r\nWapping in the west,[275] the usual place of execution for hanging of\r\npirates and sea rovers, at the low-water mark, and there to remain,\r\ntill three tides had overflowed them, was never a house standing within\r\nthese forty years; but since the gallows being after removed farther\r\noff, a continual street, or filthy strait passage, with alleys of small\r\ntenements, or cottages, built, inhabited by sailors’ victuallers, along\r\nby the river of Thames, almost to Radcliff, a good mile from the Tower.\r\n\r\nOn the east side, and by north of the Tower, lieth East Smithfield,\r\nHogs’ street, and Tower hill; and east from them both, was the new abbey\r\ncalled Grace, founded by Edward III. From thence Radcliffe, up East\r\nSmithfield, by Nightingall lane (which runneth south to the hermitage,\r\na brewhouse so called of a hermit sometime being there), beyond this\r\nlane to the manor of Bramley (called in record of Richard II. Villa\r\nEast Smithfield, and Villa de Bramley), and to the manor of Shadwell,\r\nbelonging to the Dean of Pauls, there hath been of late, in place of\r\nelm trees, many small tenements raised towards Radcliffe; and Radcliffe\r\nitself hath been also increased in building eastward (in place where I\r\nhave known[276] a large highway, with fair elm trees on both the sides),\r\nthat the same hath now taken hold of Lime hurst, or Lime host, corruptly\r\ncalled Lime house, sometime distant a mile from Ratcliffe.\r\n\r\nHaving said this much for building at Wapping, East Smithfield, Bramley,\r\nand Shadwell, all on the south side of the highway to Radcliffe, now\r\none note on the north side, also concerning pirates. I read that in the\r\nyear 1440, in the Lent season, certain persons, with six ships, brought\r\nfrom beyond the seas fish to victual the city of London, which fish,\r\nwhen they had delivered, and were returning homeward, a number of sea\r\nthieves, in a barge, in the night came upon them, when they were asleep\r\nin their vessels, riding at anchor on the river Thames, and slew them,\r\ncut their throats, cast them overboard, took their money, and drowned\r\ntheir ships, for that no man should espy or accuse them. Two of these\r\nthieves were after taken, and hanged in chains upon a gallows set\r\nupon a raised hill, for that purpose made, in the field beyond East\r\nSmithfield, so that they might be seen far into the river Thames. The\r\nfirst building at Radcliffe in my youth (not to be forgotten) was a fair\r\nfree school and alms houses, founded by Avice Gibson, wife to Nicholas\r\nGibson, grocer, as before I have noted: but of late years shipwrights,\r\nand (for the most part) other marine men, have built many large and\r\nstrong houses for themselves, and smaller for sailors, from thence\r\nalmost to Poplar, and so to Blake wall. Now for Tower hill; the plain\r\nthere is likewise greatly diminished by merchants[277] for building of\r\nsmall tenements; from thence towards Aldgate was the Minories, whereof I\r\nhave spoken.\r\n\r\nFrom Aldgate east again lieth a large street, replenished with\r\nbuildings; to wit, on the north side the parish church of St. Botolph,\r\nand so other buildings, to Hog lane, and to the bars on both sides.\r\n\r\nAlso without the bars both the sides of the street be pestered with\r\ncottages and alleys, even up to Whitechapel church, and almost half a\r\nmile beyond it, into the common field; all which ought to be open and\r\nfree for all men. But this common field, I say, being sometime the\r\nbeauty of this city on that part, is so encroached upon by building of\r\nfilthy cottages, and with other purpressors, inclosures, and laystalls\r\n(notwithstanding all proclamations and acts of parliament made to\r\nthe contrary), that in some places it scarce remaineth a sufficient\r\nhighway for the meeting of carriages and droves of cattle; much less is\r\nthere any fair, pleasant, or wholesome way for people to walk on foot;\r\nwhich is no small blemish to so famous a city to have so unsavoury and\r\nunseemly an entrance or passage thereunto.\r\n\r\nNow of Whitechapel church somewhat, and then back again to Aldgate. This\r\nchurch is, as it were, a chapel of ease to the parish of Stebinhith,\r\nand the parson of Stebinhith hath the gift thereof; which being first\r\ndedicated to the name of God and the blessed Virgin, is now called St.\r\nMary Matfellon. About the year 1428, the 6th of King Henry VI., a devout\r\nwidow of that parish had long time cherished and brought up of alms a\r\ncertain Frenchman, or Breton born, which most unkindly and cruelly in\r\na night murdered the said widow sleeping in her bed, and after fled\r\nwith such jewels and other stuff of her as he might carry; but he was\r\nso freshly pursued, that for fear he took the church of St. George in\r\nSouthwark, and challenged privilege of sanctuary there, and so abjured\r\nthe king’s land. Then the constables (having charge of him) brought him\r\ninto London, intending to have conveyed him eastward; but so soon as\r\nhe was come into the parish, where before he had committed the murder,\r\nthe wives cast upon him so much filth and odour of the street, that\r\n(notwithstanding the best resistance made by the constables) they slew\r\nhim out of hand; and for this feat, it hath been said, that parish to\r\nhave purchased that name of St. Mary Matfellon; but I find in record the\r\nsame to be called Villa beatæ Mariæ de Matfellon, in the 21st of Richard\r\nII.\r\n\r\nMore, we read, that in the year 1336, the 10th of Edward III., the\r\nbishop of Alba, cardinal and parson of Stebinhith, procurator general\r\nin England, presented a clerk to be parson in the church of the blessed\r\nMary called Matfellon, without Aldgate of London, etc.\r\n\r\nNow again from Aldgate north-west to Bishopsgate, lieth Houndsditch, and\r\nso to Bishopsgate.\r\n\r\nNorth, and by east from Bishopsgate, lieth a large street or highway,\r\nhaving on the west side thereof the parish church of St. Buttolph.\r\n\r\nThen is the hospital of St. Mary of Bethelem, founded by a citizen\r\nof London, and as before is showed: up to the bars without the which\r\nis Norton fall gate, a liberty so called, belonging to the dean of\r\nPauls; thence up to the late dissolved priory of St. John Baptist,\r\ncalled Holywell, a house of nuns, of old time founded by a bishop of\r\nLondon. Stephen Grausend, bishop of London, about the year 1318, was a\r\nbenefactor thereunto; re-edified by Sir Thomas Lovel,[278] knight of the\r\ngarter, who built much there in the reigns of Henry VII. and of Henry\r\nVIII.; he endowed this house with fair lands, and was there buried in a\r\nlarge chapel by him built for that purpose. This priory was valued at\r\nthe suppression to have of lands two hundred and ninety-three pounds\r\nby year, and was surrendered 1539, the 31st of Henry VIII. The church\r\nthereof being pulled down, many houses have been built for the lodgings\r\nof noblemen, of strangers born, and other.[279]\r\n\r\nFrom Holywell in the high street is a continual building of tenements\r\nto Sewers ditch,[280] having one small side of a field, already made a\r\ngarden plot. Over against the north corner of this field, between it and\r\nthe church of St. Leonarde in Shoreditch, sometime stood a cross, now\r\na smith’s forge, dividing three ways: forth right the highway is built\r\nupon either side, more than a good flight shot, towards Kinges land,\r\nNewington, Totanham, etc.\r\n\r\nOn the left hand is Galde street, which reacheth west to a stone cross,\r\nover against the north end of Golden lane,[281] and so to the end of\r\nGoswell street. On the right hand of this Galde street, not far from\r\nSowers ditch, but on the north side thereof, is Hoxton, a large street\r\nwith houses on both sides, and is a prebend belonging to Pauls church in\r\nLondon, but of Soers ditch parish.\r\n\r\nOn the right hand beyond Soers ditch church toward Hackney are some late\r\nbuilt houses upon the common soil, for it was a leystall, but those\r\nhouses belong to the parish of Stebunhith.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the highway from Bishopsgate and Houndsditch is the\r\nDolphin, a common inn for receipt of travellers; then a house built by\r\nthe Lord John Powlet, then Fisher’s folly,[282] and so up to the west\r\nend of Berwardes lane, is a continual building of small cottages, then\r\nthe hospital called St. Mary Spittle, hard within the bars, whereof I\r\nhave spoken in Bishopsgate ward.\r\n\r\nFrom the which bars towards Soers ditch[283] on that side is all along a\r\ncontinual building of small and base tenements, for the most part lately\r\nerected.\r\n\r\nAmongst the which (I mean of the ancientest building) was one row\r\nof proper small houses, with gardens for poor decayed people, there\r\nplaced by the prior of the said hospital; every one tenant whereof paid\r\none penny rent by the year at Christmas, and dined with the prior on\r\nChristmas day: but after the suppression of the hospital, these houses,\r\nfor want of reparations, in few years were so decayed, that it was\r\ncalled Rotten row, and the poor worn out (for there came no new in their\r\nplace) houses, for a small portion of money, were sold from Goddard to\r\nRussell, a draper, who new built them, and let them out for rent enough,\r\ntaking also large fines of the tenants, near as much as the houses cost\r\nhim purchase and building; for he made his bargains so hardly with all\r\nmen, that both carpenter, bricklayer, and plasterer, were by that work\r\nundone: and yet, in honour of his name, it is now called Russell’s row.\r\n\r\nNow for the parish of St. Leonard at Soers ditch, the archdeacon of\r\nLondon is always parson thereof, and the cure is served by a vicar. In\r\nthis church have been divers honourable persons buried, as appeareth\r\nby monuments yet remaining: Sir John Elrington, with Margaret his\r\nwife, daughter and heir to Thomas Lord Itchingham, widow to William\r\nBlount, son and heir to Walter Blount, the first Lord Mountjoy, which\r\nMargaret died 1481, Sir Humfrey Starkie, recorder of London, baron of\r\nthe Exchequer; John Gadde, shereman of London, and Anne his wife, 1480;\r\nSir Thomas Seymore, mayor of London, deceased 1535; Sir Thomas Ligh,\r\ndoctor of law, 1545. Item, under one fair monument lieth buried the Lady\r\nKatherine, daughter to Edward, duke of Buckingham, wife to Ralph Nevell,\r\nEarl of Westmoreland, who died 1553; also Elianor, daughter to Sir\r\nWilliam Paston, wife to Thomas Mannars, earl of Rutland, 1551; Margaret,\r\ndaughter to Ralph Nevel, earl of Westmoreland, and wife to Henry\r\nMannars, earl of Rutland, 1560; Katherine, daughter to Henry Nevel, earl\r\nof Westmoreland, and wife to Sir John Constable of Holderness, 1591;\r\nAnne, daughter to T. Mannars, earl of Rutland; Sir T. Mannars, fourth\r\nson to Thomas, earl of Rutland, 1591; Oliver Mannars, fifth son to\r\nThomas, earl of Rutland, 1563, all under one monument; Richard and Harry\r\nYoung, 1545.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that of late one vicar there, for covetousness of the\r\nbrass, which he converted into coined silver, plucking up many plates\r\nfixed on the graves, and left no memory of such as had been buried under\r\nthem, a great injury both to the living and the dead, forbidden by\r\npublic proclamation, in the reign of our sovereign lady Queen Elizabeth,\r\nbut not forborne by many, that either of a preposterous zeal, or of a\r\ngreedy mind, spare not to satisfy themselves by so wicked a means.\r\n\r\nOne note of Shoreditch, and so an end of that suburb. I read, that in\r\nthe year 1440, the 18th of Henry VI. a fuller of Shoreditch appeached\r\nof treason many worthy esquires and gentlemen of Kent, but he being\r\nproved false, was attainted, condemned, and had judgment to be drawn,\r\nhanged, and quartered; which was done; his head set on London bridge,\r\nand his quarters on the gates. This justice was done according to the\r\nxvith of Deuteronomy: “The judges shall make diligent inquisition, and\r\nif the witness be found false, and to have given false witness against\r\nhis brother, then shall they do unto him as he had thought to do unto\r\nhis brother,” etc. I read of the King’s Manor vocatur Shoreditch-place,\r\nin the parish of Hackney, but how it took that name I know not, and\r\ntherefore I will turn back from Shoreditch cross to Bethelem cross, and\r\nso pass through that hospital into the Morefield, which lieth without\r\nthe postern called Moregate.\r\n\r\nThis field of old time was called the More, as appeareth by the charter\r\nof William the Conqueror to the college of St. Martin, declaring a\r\nrunning water to pass into the city from the same More. Also Fitzstephen\r\nwriteth of this More, saying thus: “When the great fen, or moor, which\r\nwatereth the walls on the north side, is frozen,” etc. This fen, or moor\r\nfield, stretching from the wall of the city betwixt Bishopsgate and the\r\npostern called Cripples gate, to Fensbery and to Holy well, continued\r\na waste and unprofitable ground a long time, so that the same was all\r\nletten for four marks the year, in the reign of Edward II.; but in\r\nthe year 1415, the 3rd of Henry V., Thomas Fawconer, mayor, as I have\r\nshowed, caused the wall of the city to be broken toward the said moor,\r\nand built the postern called Moregate, for the ease of the citizens to\r\nwalk that way upon causeys towards Iseldon and Hoxton: moreover, he\r\ncaused the ditches of the city, and other the ditches from Soers ditch\r\nto Deepe ditch, by Bethelem, into the More ditch, to be new cast and\r\ncleansed; by means whereof the said fen or moor was greatly drained and\r\ndried; but shortly after, to wit, in 1477, Ralph Joceline, mayor, for\r\nrepairing of the wall of the city, caused the said moor to be searched\r\nfor clay, and brick to be burnt there, etc.; by which means this field\r\nwas made the worse for a long time.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1498, all the gardens, which had continued time out of mind\r\nwithout Moregate, to wit, about and beyond the lordship of Finsbury,\r\nwere destroyed; and of them was made a plain field for archers to shoot\r\nin. And in the year 1512, Roger Archley, mayor, caused divers dikes\r\nto be cast, and made to drain the waters of the said Morefielde, with\r\nbridges arched over them, and the grounds about to be levelled, whereby\r\nthe said field was made somewhat more commodious, but yet it stood\r\nfull of noisome waters; whereupon, in the year 1527, Sir Thomas Semor,\r\nmayor, caused divers sluices to be made to convey the said waters over\r\nthe Town ditch, into the course of Walbrooke, and so into the Thames;\r\nand by these degrees was this fen or moor at length made main and hard\r\nground, which before being overgrown with flags, sedges, and rushes,\r\nserved to no use; since the which time also the further grounds beyond\r\nFinsbury court have been so overheightened with lay-stalls of dung, that\r\nnow three windmills are thereon set; the ditches be filled up, and the\r\nbridges overwhelmed.\r\n\r\nAnd now concerning the inclosures of common grounds about this city,\r\nwhereof I mind not much to argue, Edward Hall setteth down a note of\r\nhis time, to wit, in the 5th, or rather 6th of Henry VIII. “Before this\r\ntime,” saith he, “the inhabitants of the towns about London, as Iseldon,\r\nHoxton, Shoreditch, and others, had so inclosed the common fields with\r\nhedges and ditches, that neither the young men of the city might shoot,\r\nnor the ancient persons walk for their pleasures in those fields, but\r\nthat either their bows and arrows were taken away or broken, or the\r\nhonest persons arrested or indicted; saying, ‘that no Londoner ought to\r\ngo out of the city, but in the highways.’ This saying so grieved the\r\nLondoners, that suddenly this year a great number of the city assembled\r\nthemselves in a morning, and a turner, in a fool’s coat, came crying\r\nthrough the city, ‘Shovels and spades! shovels and spades!’ so many\r\nof the people followed, that it was a wonder to behold; and within\r\na short space all the hedges about the city were cast down, and the\r\nditches filled up, and every thing made plain, such was the diligence\r\nof these workmen. The king’s council hearing of this assembly, came\r\nto the Gray Friars and sent for the mayor and council of the city to\r\nknow the cause, which declared to them the injury and annoying done to\r\nthe citizens and to their liberties, which though they would not seek\r\ndisorderly to redress, yet the commonalty and young persons could not\r\nbe stayed thus to remedy the same. When the king’s council had heard\r\ntheir answer, they dissimuled the matter, and commanded the mayor to\r\nsee that no other thing were attempted, but that they should forthwith\r\ncall home the younger sort; who having speedily achieved their desire,\r\nreturned home before the king’s council, and the mayor departed without\r\nmore harm: after which time (saith Hall) these fields were never hedged,\r\nbut now we see the thing in worse case than ever, by means of inclosure\r\nfor gardens, wherein are built many fair summer-houses;[284] and, as\r\nin other places of the suburbs, some of them like Midsummer pageants,\r\nwith towers, turrets, and chimney-tops, not so much for use of profit\r\nas for show and pleasure, betraying the vanity of men’s minds, much\r\nunlike to the disposition of the ancient citizens, who delighted in the\r\nbuilding of hospitals and alms-houses for the poor, and therein both\r\nemployed their wits, and spent their wealths in preferment of the common\r\ncommodity of this our city.”\r\n\r\nBut to come back again to Moregate, and from thence west through a\r\nnarrow lane called the Postern, because it hath at either end a door to\r\nbe shut in the night season, betwixt the More ditch inclosed with brick\r\nfor tenter-yards, and the gardens of the said More field, to More lane;\r\na part of the suburb without Cripplegate, without this postern, called\r\nCripplegate, also lay a part of the said More even to the river of the\r\nWells, as in another place I have showed; and no houses were there built\r\ntill the latter end of the reign of William the Conqueror, and of his\r\nson William Rufus; about which times some few houses being there built\r\nalong east and west, thwart before the said gate, one Alfune built for\r\nthe inhabitants a parish church, which is of St. Giles, somewhat west\r\nfrom the said gate, and is now on the bank of the town ditch; and so was\r\nthere a street, since called Fore street, as standing before the gate.\r\n\r\nThis Alfune, in the reign of Henry I., became the first hospitaller of\r\nSt. Bartlemewe’s hospital in Smithfield, as in another place I have\r\nnoted. And this parish church of St. Giles being at the first a small\r\nthing, stood in place where now standeth the vicarage-house, but hath\r\nbeen since at divers times much enlarged, according as the parish\r\nhath increased, and was at the length newly built in place where now\r\nit standeth. But the same new church being large, strongly built, and\r\nrichly furnished with ornaments, was in the year 1545, by casualty of\r\nfire, sore burnt and consumed, notwithstanding it was again within a\r\nshort space of time repaired, as now it showeth.\r\n\r\nSome little distance from the east end of this church standeth a fair\r\nconduit, castellated, in Fore street. Then have ye a boss of sweet water\r\nin the wall of the churchyard, lately made a pump, but already decayed.\r\n\r\nThen have ye a fair pool of sweet water near to the church of St. Giles,\r\nwherein Anne of Lodbery was drowned, as I have before declared.\r\n\r\nIn the east end of Fore street is More lane: then next is Grub street;\r\nof late years inhabited, for the most part, by bowyers, fletchers,\r\nbow-string makers, and such like occupations, now little occupied;\r\narchery giving place to a number of bowling-alleys and dicing-houses,\r\nwhich in all places are increased, and too much frequented.\r\n\r\nThis street stretcheth north to Guerades Well street, which thwarteth it\r\nto White cross street; the next from Fore street north is White cross\r\nstreet, likewise extending itself up to the west end of Guerades Well\r\nstreet, and from the end thereof to Eald street.\r\n\r\nFrom the west end of Fore street lieth Red cross street; from the which\r\ncross on the right hand east lieth Beech lane, and reacheth to the White\r\ncross street. From Red cross north lieth Golding lane, which stretcheth\r\nup to a cross in Ealde street, which Golding lane on both the sides is\r\nreplenished with many tenements of poor people.\r\n\r\nOn the left hand, and west of the Red cross, lieth a street of old\r\ntime called Houndes ditch, and of later time named Barbican, of such\r\ncause as I have before noted. And thus have you all the suburb without\r\nCripplegate, being almost altogether in the parish of St. Giles, which\r\nhath more than eighteen hundred householders, and above four thousand\r\ncommunicants.\r\n\r\nWithout Aldersgate on the left hand is the parish church of St.\r\nButtolph; on the north side of the which church lieth a way called\r\nLittle Britane street, towards the priory of St. Bartholomew in\r\nSmithfield; but the highway without Aldersgate runneth straight north\r\nfrom the said gate unto Houndes ditch, or Barbican street, on the right\r\nhand, and Long lane on the left hand, which runneth into Smithfield.\r\n\r\nThen from the farther end of Aldersgate street, straight north to\r\nthe bar, is called Goswell street, replenished with small tenements,\r\ncottages, and alleys, gardens, banqueting-houses, and bowling-places.\r\n\r\nBeyond these bars, leaving the Charter-house on the left hand, or the\r\nwest side, the way stretcheth up towards Iseldon, and on the right hand,\r\nor east side, at a Red cross, turneth into Eald street, so called, for\r\nthat it was the old highway from Aldersgate, for the north-east parts\r\nof England, before Bishopsgate was built, which street runneth east\r\nto a smith’s forge, sometime a cross before Shoreditch church, from\r\nwhence the passengers and carriages were to turn north to King’s land,\r\nTottenham, Waltham, Ware, etc.\r\n\r\nThere was sometime in this suburb without Aldersgate an hospital for the\r\npoor, but an alien of Clunie, a French order, and therefore suppressed\r\nby King Henry V., who gave the house, with lands and goods, to the\r\nparish of St. Buttolph, and a brotherhood of the Trinity was there\r\nfounded, which was afterward suppressed by Henry VIII. or Edward VI.\r\n\r\nThere is at the farthest north corner of this suburb a windmill, which\r\nwas sometime by a tempest of wind overthrown, and in place thereof a\r\nchapel was built by Queen Katherine (first wife to Henry VIII.), who\r\nnamed it the Mount of Calvary, because it was of Christ’s passion, and\r\nwas in the end of Henry VIII. pulled down, and a windmill newly set up\r\nas afore.\r\n\r\nWithout Newgate lieth the west and by north suburb; on the right hand,\r\nor north side whereof, betwixt the said gate and the parish of St.\r\nSepulchre, turneth a way towards West Smithfield, called, as I have\r\nshowed, Giltspurre street, or Knightriders street; then is Smithfield\r\nitself compassed about with buildings, as I have before declared, in\r\nFaringdon ward without.\r\n\r\nAnd without the bar of West Smithfield lieth a large street or way,\r\ncalled of the house of St. John there St. John’s street, and stretcheth\r\ntoward Iseldon, on the right hand whereof stood the late dissolved\r\nmonastery called the Charterhouse, founded by Sir Walter Manny, knight,\r\na stranger born, lord of the town of Manny, in the diocese of Cambrey,\r\nbeyond the seas, who for service done to King Edward III. was made\r\nknight of the garter: so his house he founded upon this occasion. A\r\ngreat pestilence entering this island, began first in Dorsetshire,\r\nthen proceeded into Devonshire, Somersetshire, Gloucestershire, and\r\nOxfordshire, and at length came to London, and overspread all England,\r\nso wasting the people, that scarce the tenth person of all sorts was\r\nleft alive, and churchyards were not sufficient to receive the dead,\r\nbut men were forced to choose out certain fields for burials; whereupon\r\nRalph Stratford, bishop of London, in the year 1348, bought a piece of\r\nground called No Man’s Land, which he inclosed with a wall of brick, and\r\ndedicated for burial of the dead, building thereupon a proper chapel,\r\nwhich is now enlarged and made a dwelling-house; and this burying plot\r\nis become a fair garden, retaining the old name of Pardon churchyard.\r\n\r\nAbout this, in the year 1349, the said Sir Walter Manny, in respect\r\nof danger that might befall in this time of so great a plague and\r\ninfection, purchased thirteen acres and a rod of ground adjoining to the\r\nsaid No Man’s Land, and lying in a place called Spittle cross, because\r\nit belonged to St, Bartilmewe’s hospital, since that called the New\r\nchurch haw, and caused it to be consecrated by the said bishop of London\r\nto the use of burials.\r\n\r\nIn this plot of ground there were in that year more than fifty thousand\r\npersons buried, as I have read in the charters of Edward III.: also,\r\nI have seen and read an inscription fixed on a stone cross, sometime\r\nstanding in the same churchyard, and having these words:--“_Anno Domini\r\n1349, regnante magna pestilentia consecratum fuit hoc Cœmiterium, in quo\r\net infra septa presentis monasterii, sepulta fuerunt mortuorum corpora\r\nplusquam quinquaginta millia, præter alia multa abhinc usque ad presens,\r\nquorum animabus propitietur Deus. Amen._”\r\n\r\nIn consideration of the number of Christian people here buried, the\r\nsaid Sir Walter Manny caused first a chapel to be built, where for\r\nthe space of twenty-three years offerings were made; and it is to be\r\nnoted, that above one hundred thousand bodies of Christian people had\r\nin that churchyard been buried; for the said knight had purchased that\r\nplace for the burial of poor people, travellers, and other that were\r\ndeceased, to remain for ever; whereupon an order was taken for the\r\navoiding of contention between the parsons of churches and that house;\r\nto wit, that the bodies should be had unto the church where they were\r\nparishioners, or died, and, after the funeral service done, had to\r\nthe place where they should be buried. And in the year 1371 he caused\r\nthere to be founded a house of Carthusian monks, which he willed to be\r\ncalled the Salutation, and that one of the monks should be called prior;\r\nand he gave them the said place of thirteen acres and a rod of land,\r\nwith the chapel and houses there built, for their habitation: he also\r\ngave them the three acres of land lying without the walls on the north\r\npart, betwixt the lands of the abbot of Westminster and the lands of\r\nthe prior of St. John (which three acres were purchased, inclosed, and\r\ndedicated by Ralph Stratford, bishop of London, as is afore showed),\r\nand remained till our time by the name of Pardon churchyard, and served\r\nfor burying of such as desperately ended their lives, or were executed\r\nfor felonies, who were fetched thither usually in a close cart, bailed\r\nover and covered with black, having a plain white cross thwarting, and\r\nat the fore end a St. John’s cross without, and within a bell ringing by\r\nshaking of the cart, whereby the same might be heard when it passed; and\r\nthis was called the friary cart, which belonged to St. John’s, and had\r\nthe privilege of sanctuary.\r\n\r\nIn this charter-house were the monuments of the said Sir Walter Manny,\r\nand Margaret his wife; Marmaduke Lumley; Laurence Brumley, knight; Sir\r\nEdward Hederset, knight; Sir William Manny, knight; Dame Joan Borough;\r\nJohn Dore; Want Water, knight; Robert Olney, esquire; Katherine,\r\ndaughter to Sir William Babington, knight; Blanch, daughter to Hugh\r\nWaterton; Katherine, wife to John at Poote, daughter and heir to Richard\r\nde Lacie; William Rawlin; Sir John Lenthaine, and Dame Margaret his\r\nwife, daughter to John Fray; John Peake, esquire; William Baron, and\r\nWilliam Baron, esquire; Sir Thomas Thawites, knight; Philip Morgan,\r\nbishop of Ely, 1434.\r\n\r\nIn the cloister:--Bartholomew Rede, knight, mayor of London, buried\r\n1505; Sir John Popham, etc.\r\n\r\nThis monastery, at the suppression in the 29th of Henry VIII., was\r\nvalued at six hundred and forty-two pounds and four pence halfpenny\r\nyearly.\r\n\r\nA little without the bars of West Smithfield is Charterhouse lane, so\r\ncalled, for that it leadeth to the said plot of the late dissolved\r\nmonastery; in place whereof, first the Lord North, but since Thomas\r\nHoward, late Duke of Norfolk, have made large and sumptuous buildings\r\nboth for lodging and pleasure. At the gate of this Charter-house is a\r\nfair water conduit, with two cocks, serving the use of the neighbours to\r\ntheir great commodity.\r\n\r\nSt. John’s street, from the entering this lane, is also on both the\r\nsides replenished with buildings up to Clerkenwell. On the left hand of\r\nwhich street lieth a lane called Cow cross, of a cross sometime standing\r\nthere; which lane turneth down to another lane called Turnemill street,\r\nwhich stretcheth up to the west of Clerkenwell, and was called Turnemill\r\nstreet, for such cause as is afore declared.\r\n\r\nOne other lane there is called St. Peter’s lane, which turneth from St.\r\nJohn’s street to Cow cross.\r\n\r\nOn the left hand also stood the late dissolved priory of St. John of\r\nJerusalem in England, founded about the year of Christ 1100 by Jorden\r\nBriset, baron, and Muriell his wife, near unto Clarkes well besides West\r\nSmithfield; which Jorden having first founded the priory of nuns at\r\nClarkes well, bought of them ten acres of land, giving them in exchange\r\nten acres of land in his lordship of Welling hall, in the county of\r\nKent. St. John’s church was dedicated by Eraclius, patriarch of the holy\r\nresurrection of Christ at Jerusalem, in the year 1185, and was the chief\r\nseat in England of the religious knights of St. John of Jerusalem; whose\r\nprofession was, besides their daily service of God, to defend Christians\r\nagainst pagans, and to fight for the church, using for their habit a\r\nblack upper garment, with a white cross on the fore part thereof; and\r\nfor their good service was so highly esteemed, that when the order of\r\nTemplars was dissolved, their lands and possessions were by parliament\r\ngranted unto these, who after the loss of Jerusalem recovered the isle\r\nof Rhodes from the Turks, and there placed themselves, being called\r\nthereof for many years knights of the Rhodes; but after the loss\r\nthereof, 1523, they removed to the isle of Malta, manfully opposing\r\nthemselves against the Turkish invasions.\r\n\r\nThe rebels of Essex and of Kent, 1381, set fire on this house, causing\r\nit to burn by the space of seven days together, not suffering any to\r\nquench it; since the which time the priors of that house have new built\r\nboth the church and houses thereunto appertaining; which church was\r\nfinished by Thomas Docwrey, late lord prior there, about the year 1504,\r\nas appeareth by the inscription over the gate-house, yet remaining.\r\nThis house, at the suppression in the 32nd of Henry VIII., was valued\r\nto dispend in lands three thousand three hundred and eighty-five pounds\r\nnineteen shillings and eight pence yearly. Sir W. Weston being then\r\nlord prior, died on the same seventh of May, on which the house was\r\nsuppressed; so that great yearly pensions being granted to the knights\r\nby the king, and namely to the lord prior during his life one thousand\r\npounds, he never received a penny.\r\n\r\nThe king took into his hands all the lands that belonged to that house\r\nand that order, wheresoever in England and Ireland, for the augmentation\r\nof his crown.\r\n\r\nThis priory church and house of St. John was preserved from spoil or\r\ndown pulling, so long as King Henry VIII. reigned, and was employed\r\nas a store-house for the king’s toils and tents, for hunting, and for\r\nthe wars, etc.; but in the 3rd of King Edward VI., the church, for the\r\nmost part, to wit, the body and side aisles, with the great bell tower\r\n(a most curious piece of workmanship, graven, gilt, and enamelled, to\r\nthe great beautifying of the city, and passing all other that I have\r\nseen), was undermined and blown up with gunpowder; the stone thereof\r\nwas employed in building of the lord protector’s house at the Strand.\r\nThat part of the choir which remaineth, with some side chapels, was by\r\ncardinal Pole, in the reign of Queen Mary, closed up at the west end,\r\nand otherwise repaired; and Sir Thomas Tresham, knight, was then made\r\nlord prior there, with restitution of some lands, but the same was again\r\nsuppressed in the first year of Queen Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nThere were buried in this church brethren of that house and knights\r\nof that order: John Botell; William Bagecore; Richard Barrow; John\r\nVanclay; Thomas Launcelen; John Mallory; William Turney; William\r\nHulles, Hils, or Hayles; John Weston; Redington; William Longstrother;\r\nJohn Longstrother; William Tong; John Wakeline. Then of other: Thomas\r\nThornburgh, gentleman; William West, gentleman; John Fulling, and Adam\r\nGill, esquires; Sir John Mortimor, and Dame Elianor his wife; Nicholas\r\nSilverston; William Plompton, esquire; Margaret Tong, and Isabel Tong;\r\nWalter Bellingham, alias Ireland, king of arms of Ireland; Thomas Bedle,\r\ngentleman; Katherine, daughter of William Plompton, esquire; Richard\r\nTurpin, gentleman; Joan, wife to Alexander Dikes; John Bottle, and\r\nRichard Bottle, esquires; Rowland Darcie; Richard Sutton, gentleman;\r\nRichard Bottill, gentleman; Sir W. Harpden, knight; Robert Kingston,\r\nesquire, and Margery his wife; John Roch; Richard Cednor, gentleman;\r\nSimon Mallory, 1442; William Mallory, Robert Longstrother, Ralph\r\nAsteley, William Marshall, Robert Savage, Robert Gondall, esquires, and\r\nMargery his wife; William Bapthorpe, baron of the Exchequer, 1442.\r\n\r\nNorth from the house of St. John’s was the priory of Clarkenwell, so\r\ncalled of Clarkes well adjoining; which priory was also founded about\r\nthe year 1100 by Jorden Briset, baron, the son of Ralph, the son of\r\nBrian Briset; who gave to Robert, a priest, fourteen acres of land lying\r\nin the field next adjoining to the said Clarkes well, thereupon to\r\nbuild a house of religious persons, which he founded to the honour of\r\nGod and the assumption of our lady, and placed therein black nuns. This\r\nJorden Briset gave also to that house one piece of ground, thereby to\r\nbuild a windmill upon, etc. He and Muriall his wife were buried in the\r\nChapter-house there. More buried in this church: John Wikes, esquire,\r\nand Isabel his wife; Dame Agnes Clifford; Ralph Timbleby, esquire; Dame\r\nJahan, baroness of Greystocke; Dame Jahan, Lady Ferrars. And of later\r\ntime in the parish church, Constances Bennet, a Greek born: he gave two\r\nhouses, the one in St. John’s street, the other in Turnmill street; the\r\nrents of them to be distributed in coals every year against Christmas to\r\nthe poor of that parish.\r\n\r\nWilliam Herne, a master of defence, and yeoman of the guard, 1580,\r\ngave lands and tenements to the clothworkers in London; they to pay\r\nyearly for ever fourteen pounds to the churchwardens of Clarkenwell,\r\nand fourteen pounds to the churchwardens of St. Sepulcher’s, towards\r\nreparations of these churches, and relief of the poor men; more he gave\r\nafter the death of one man, yet living, eight pounds the year for ever\r\nto the mending of highways.\r\n\r\nThomas Sackeford, esquire, one of the masters of requests, gave to\r\nthe poor of that parish forty shillings the year for ever, out of his\r\nalms-house at Woodbridge in Suffolk, where he is buried. Henry Stoke,\r\ngardener, buried there, gave twenty shillings the year for ever, towards\r\nreparation of that church. This priory was valued to dispend two hundred\r\nand sixty-two pounds nine shillings by the year, and was surrendered the\r\n31st of Henry VIII. Many fair houses are now built about the priory,\r\nnamely, by the highway towards Iseldon.\r\n\r\nSo much of the church which remaineth (for one great aisle thereof fell\r\ndown) serveth as a parish church of St. John, not only for the tenements\r\nand near inhabitants, but also (as is aforesaid) for all up to Highgate,\r\nMuswell, etc.\r\n\r\nNear unto this church, beside Clarke’s well lane, divers other wells,\r\nnamely, Skinners well, Fags well, Tode well, Loder’s well, Rede well,\r\netc., now dammed up.\r\n\r\nNow to return again to Giltspurre street, where I first began with\r\nthis suburb, there standeth the parish church of St. Sepulchre in the\r\nBayly, as is before showed; from this street to Turnagaine lane, by\r\nHosiar lane, Cow lane, and Holdborn conduit, down Snore hill to Oldborne\r\nbridge, and up Oldborne hill, by Gold lane on the right hand, and Lither\r\nlane beyond it, to the bars; beyond the which bars on the same side is\r\nPorte pool, or Grayes inn lane, so called of the inn of court, named\r\nGrayes inn, a goodly house there situate, by whom built or first begun I\r\nhave not yet learned, but seemeth to be since Edward III.’s time, and is\r\na prebend to Paule’s church in London.\r\n\r\nThis lane is furnished with fair buildings and many tenements on both\r\nthe sides, leading to the fields towards Highgate and Hamsted.\r\n\r\nOn the high street have ye many fair houses built, and lodgings for\r\ngentlemen, inns for travellers, and such like up almost (for it lacketh\r\nbut little) to St. Giles in the fields; amongst the which buildings,\r\nfor the most part being very new, one passeth the rest in largeness\r\nof rooms, lately built by a widow, sometime wife to Richard Alington,\r\nesquire; which Richard Alington deceased in the year 1561. And thus much\r\nfor that north side of Oldborne.\r\n\r\nNow from Newgate, on the left hand or south side, lieth the Old Bayly,\r\nand so down by Seacole lane end to Oldborne bridge, up Oldborne hill, by\r\nShoe lane and Fewters lane, to the bars.\r\n\r\nBeyond the bars had ye in old time a temple built by the Templars, whose\r\norder first began in the year of Christ 1118, in the 19th of Henry I.\r\nThis temple was left and fell to ruin since the year 1184, when the\r\nTemplars had built them a new temple in Fleet street, near to the river\r\nof Thames. A great part of this old temple was pulled down, but of late\r\nin the year 1595. Adjoining to this old Temple[285] was sometime the\r\nbishop of Lincolne’s inn, wherein he lodged when he repaired to this\r\ncity. Robert de Curars, bishop of Lincoln, built it about the year 1147.\r\nJohn Russell, bishop of Lincoln, chancellor of England, in the reign of\r\nRichard III., was lodged there. It hath of late years belonged to the\r\nearls of Southampton, and therefore called Southampton house. Master\r\nRopar hath of late built much there; by means whereof part of the ruins\r\nof the old Temple were seen to remain built of Caen stone, round in form\r\nas the new Temple, by Temple bar, and other temples in England. Beyond\r\nthis old Temple and the bishop of Lincoln’s house[286] is New street, so\r\ncalled in the reign of Henry III., when he of a Jew’s house founded the\r\nhouse of Converts, betwixt the old Temple and the new.\r\n\r\nThe same street hath since been called Chancery lane, by reason that\r\nKing Edward III. annexed the house of Converts by patent to the office\r\nof Custos Rotulorum, or master of the rolls, in the 15th of his reign.\r\n\r\nIn this street the first fair building to be noted on the east side\r\nis called the Coursitors’ office, built with divers fair lodgings for\r\ngentlemen, all of brick and timber, by Sir Nicholas Bacon, late lord\r\nkeeper of the great seal.\r\n\r\nNear unto this Coursitors’ office be divers fair houses and large\r\ngardens, built and made in a ground sometime belonging to one great\r\nhouse on the other side the street, there made by Ralph Nevel, bishop of\r\nChichester. This ground he had by the gift of Henry III., as appeareth.\r\nThe king granteth to Ralph, bishop of Chichester, chancellor, that\r\nplace, with the garden, which John Herlirum forfeited in that street,\r\ncalled New street, over against the land of the said bishop in the same\r\nstreet; which place, with the garden and appurtenance, was the king’s\r\nescheat by the liberty of the city of London, as it was acknowledged\r\nbefore the king in his court at the Tower of London, in the last pleas\r\nof the crown of that city, cart. 11 Henry III.\r\n\r\nThen was the house of Converts, wherein now the rolls of Chancery be\r\nkept; then the Sergeants’ inn, etc.\r\n\r\nOn the west side of New street, towards the north end thereof, was\r\nof old time the church and house of the Preaching Friers; concerning\r\nthe which house I find, that in the year of Christ 1221, the friars’\r\npreachers, thirteen in number, came into England, and having to their\r\nprior one named Gilbert de Fraxineto, in company of Peter de la Roche,\r\nbishop of Winchester, came to Canterbury, where presenting themselves\r\nbefore the archbishop Steven, he commanded the said prior to preach,\r\nwhose sermon he liked so well, that ever after he loved that order.\r\nThese friars came to London, and had their first house without the wall\r\nof the city by Oldborne, near unto the old Temple.\r\n\r\nHubert de Burgh, earl of Kent, was a great benefactor unto these friars,\r\nand deceasing at his manor of Bansted in Surrey, or, after some writers,\r\nat his castle of Barkhamsted in Hartfordshire, in the year 1242, was\r\nburied in their church; unto the which church he had given his place\r\nat Westminster, which the said friars afterwards sold to Walter Grey,\r\narchbishop of York; and he left it to his successors in that see for\r\never, to be their house, when they should repair to the city of London.\r\nAnd therefore the same was called York place; which name so continued\r\nuntil the year 1529, that King Henry VIII. took it from Thomas Wolsey,\r\ncardinal and archbishop of York, and then gave it to name White hall.\r\n\r\nMargaret, sister to the king of Scots, widow to Geffrey, earl marshal,\r\ndeceased 1244, and was buried in this church.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1250, the friars of this order of preachers through\r\nChristendom and from Jerusalem, were by a convocation assembled together\r\nat this their house by Oldborne, to intreat of their estate, to the\r\nnumber of four hundred, having meat and drink found them of alms,\r\nbecause they had no possessions of their own. The first day, the king\r\ncame to their chapter, found them meat and drink, and dined with them.\r\nAnother day the queen found them meat and drink; afterward the bishop\r\nof London, then the abbot of Westminster, of St. Alban’s, Waltham, and\r\nothers. In the year 1276, Gregory Rokesley, mayor, and the barons of\r\nLondon, granted and gave to Robert Kilwarbie, archbishop of Canterbury,\r\ntwo lanes or ways next the street of Baynard’s castle, and the tower of\r\nMountfichet, to be destroyed. On the which place the said Robert built\r\nthe late new church, with the rest of the stones that were left of\r\nthe said tower: and thus the black friars left their church and house\r\nby Oldborne, and departed to their new. This old friar house (juxta\r\nHolborne, saith the patent) was by King Edward I., in the 16th of his\r\nreign, given to Henry Lacy, earl of Lincoln.\r\n\r\nNext to this house of friars was one other great house, sometime\r\nbelonging to the bishop of Chichester, whereof Matthew Paris writeth\r\nthus:--“Ralph de Nova Villa, or Nevill, bishop of Chichester and\r\nchancellor of England, sometime built a noble house, even from the\r\nground, not far from the new Temple and house of Converts; in the which\r\nplace he deceased in the year 1244. In this place, after the decease\r\nof the said bishop, and in place of the house of black friars before\r\nspoken of, Henry Lacy, earl of Lincoln, constable of Chester, and custos\r\nof England, built his inn, and for the most part was lodged there: he\r\ndeceased in this house in the year 1310, and was buried in the new work\r\n(whereunto he had been a great benefactor) of St. Paul’s church betwixt\r\nour Lady chapel and St. Dunstan’s chapel. This Lincoln’s inn, sometime\r\npertaining to the bishops of Chichester, as a part of the said great\r\nhouse, is now an inn of court, retaining the name of Lincoln’s inn as\r\nafore, but now lately increased with fair buildings, and replenished\r\nwith gentlemen studious in the common laws. In the reign of Henry VIII.\r\nSir Thomas Lovell was a great builder there; especially he built the\r\ngate-house and fore front towards the east, placing thereon as well\r\nthe Lacies’ arms as his own: he caused the Lacies’ arms to be cast and\r\nwrought in lead, on the louer of the hall of that house, which was in\r\nthe three escutcheons, a lion rampant for Lacie, seven mascules voided\r\nfor Quincie, and three wheatsheafs for Chester. This louer being of late\r\nrepaired, the said escutcheons were left out. The rest of that side,\r\neven to Fleet street, is replenished with fair buildings.”\r\n\r\nNow the High Oldborne street, from the north end of New street,\r\nstretcheth on the left hand in building lately framed, up to St. Giles\r\nin the field, which was an hospital founded by Matilda the queen, wife\r\nto Henry I., about the year 1117. This hospital, said the record of\r\nEdward III., the 19th year, was founded without the bar: _Veteris Templi\r\nLondon, et conversorum_.\r\n\r\nThis hospital was founded as a cell to Burton Lager of Jerusalem, as may\r\nappear by a deed dated the 24th of Henry VII. in these words:--“Thomas\r\nNorton, knight, master of Burton Lager of Jerusalem in England, and\r\nthe brethren of the same place, keepers of the hospital of St. Giles,\r\nwithout the bars of the old Temple of London, have sold to Geffrey\r\nKent, citizen and draper of London, a messuage or house, with two\r\ncellars above, edified in the parish of Alhallowes, Hony lane, in West\r\nChepe, adjoining to the west part of a tenement called the Cote on the\r\nHope, pertaining to the drapers of London, for thirty-one pounds.”\r\n\r\nAt this hospital, the prisoners conveyed from the city of London\r\ntowards Teyborne, there to be executed for treasons, felonies, or other\r\ntrespasses, were presented with a great bowl of ale, thereof to drink at\r\ntheir pleasure, as to be their last refreshing in this life.\r\n\r\nNow without Ludgate lieth the south end of the Old Bayly, then down\r\nLudgate hill by Fleet lane, over Fleet bridge, up Fleet street, by Shoe\r\nlane, Fewtar’s lane, New street, or Chauncerie lane, and to Shire lane,\r\nby the bar on the right hand; and from Ludgate on the left hand, or\r\nsouth side, by Bride lane, Water lane, Croker’s lane, Sergeants’ inn,\r\nand the new Temple, by the bar; all which is of Faringdon ward, as is\r\nafore showed.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[275] “To Wapping in the Wose, and Wapping itself, the usual place,\r\netc.”--_1st edition_, p. 347.\r\n\r\n[276] “Fayre hedges, long rowes of elme, and other trees.”--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n[277] “By encroachments for building of small tenements, and taking\r\nin of garden-plots, timber-yards, or what they list. From this tower\r\nhill towards Aldgate (being a long continuous street), amongst\r\nother buildings, was that abbey of nunnes called the Minorities, or\r\nMinories, whereof I have spoken.

In the first edition, it is called Sors ditch, or\r\nSewers ditch.\r\n\r\n[281] “Over against the north end of Grub street.”--_1st edition_, p.\r\n349.\r\n\r\n[282] “Next to that a large house, with gardens of pleasure, builded by\r\nJasper Fisher, from this up to the west end of Hog lane, etc.”--_1st\r\nedition_, p. 350.\r\n\r\n[283] “Soerditch, so called more than four hundred yeares since, as I\r\ncan prove by record.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\n[284] “Banqueting houses like banqueroutes, bearing great shew and\r\nlittle worth.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\n[285] “The same was after the bishop of Lincoln’s inn.”--_1st edition_,\r\np. 361.\r\n\r\n[286] “Beyond this Southampton house.”--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIBERTIES OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER\r\n\r\n\r\nNext without the bar is the New Temple, and liberties of the city\r\nof London, in the suburbs, is a liberty pertaining to the duchy of\r\nLancaster, which beginneth in the east, on the south side or left\r\nhand, by the river Thames, and stretcheth west to Ivie bridge, where\r\nit endeth; and again on the north side, or right hand, some small\r\ndistance without Temple bar, in the high street, from a pair of stocks\r\nthere standing, stretcheth one large Middle row, or troop of small\r\ntenements, partly opening to the south, partly towards the north, up\r\nwest to a stone cross, now headless, over against the Strand; and this\r\nis the bounds to that liberty, which sometime belonged to Briane Lisle,\r\nsince to Peter of Savoy, and then to the house of Lancaster, as shall\r\nbe showed. Henry III., in the 30th year of his reign, did grant to his\r\nuncle Peter of Savoy all those houses upon the Thames, which sometimes\r\npertained to Briane de Insula, or Lisle, without the walls of his city\r\nof London, in the way or street called the Strand, to hold to him and\r\nto his heirs, yielding yearly in the Exchequer, at the feast of St.\r\nMichaell the Archangell, three barbed arrows, for all services, dated at\r\nReding, etc. This Peter of Savoy built the Savoy.\r\n\r\nBut first amongst other buildings memorable for greatness, on the river\r\nof Thames, Excester house, so called for that the same belonged to the\r\nbishops of Excester, and was their inn or London lodging: who was first\r\nbuilder thereof I have not read, but that Walter Stapleton was a great\r\nbuilder there in the reign of Edward II. is manifest; for the citizens\r\nof London, when they had beheaded him in Cheape, near unto the cathedral\r\nchurch of St. Paule, they buried him in a heap of sand or rubbish in his\r\nown house without Temple bar, where he had made great building. Edmond\r\nLacie, bishop of Excester, built the great hall in the reign of Henry\r\nVI., etc. The same hath since been called Paget house, because William\r\nLord Paget enlarged and possessed it. Then Leycester house, because\r\nRobert Dudley, earl of Leycester, of late new built there, and now Essex\r\nhouse, of the earl of Essex lodging there.\r\n\r\nThen west was a chapel dedicated to the Holy Ghost, called St. Sprite,\r\nupon what occasion founded I have not read. Next is Milford lane down to\r\nthe Thames, but why so called I have not read as yet.\r\n\r\nThen was the bishop of Bathes inn, lately new built, for a great part\r\nthereof, by the Lord Thomas Seymour, admiral; which house came since to\r\nbe possessed by the earl of Arundel, and thereof called Arundel house.\r\n\r\nNext beyond the which, on the street side, was sometime a fair cemetery\r\nor churchyard, and in the same a parish church called of the Nativity\r\nof our Lady, and the Innocents of the Strand, and of some by means of\r\na brotherhood kept there, called St. Ursula at the Strand. And near\r\nadjoining to the said church, betwixt it and the river of Thames, was an\r\ninn of Chancery commonly called Chester’s inn (because it belonged to\r\nthe bishop of Chester), by others, named of the situation, Strand inn.\r\n\r\nThen was there a house belonging to the bishop of Landaff; for I find in\r\nrecord, the 4th of Edward II., that a vacant place lying near the church\r\nof our Lady at Strand, the said bishop procured it of Thomas, earl of\r\nLancaster, for the enlarging of this house. Then had ye in the high\r\nstreet a fair bridge called Strand bridge, and under it a lane or way\r\ndown to the landing-place on the bank of Thames.\r\n\r\nThen was the bishop of Chester’s (commonly called of Lichfield and\r\nCoventrie), his inn or London lodging: this house was first built by\r\nWalter Langton, bishop of Chester, treasurer of England in the reign of\r\nEdward I.\r\n\r\nAnd next unto it adjoining was the bishop of Worcester’s inn: all which,\r\nto wit, the parish of St. Mary at Strand, Strand inn, Strand bridge,\r\nwith the lane under it, the bishop of Chester’s inn, the bishop of\r\nWorcester’s inn, with all the tenements adjoining, were by commandment\r\nof Edward, duke of Somerset, uncle to Edward VI., and lord protector,\r\npulled down, and made level ground in the year 1549; in place whereof he\r\nbuilt that large and goodly house, now called Somerset house.\r\n\r\nIn the high street, near unto the Strand, sometime stood a cross of\r\nstone against the bishop of Coventrie or Chester his house; whereof\r\nI read, that in the year 1294, and divers other times, the justices\r\nitinerants sate without London, at the stone cross over against the\r\nbishop of Coventrie’s house, and sometime they sate in the Bishop’s\r\nhouse, which was hard by the Strand, as is aforesaid.\r\n\r\nThen next is the Savoy, so called of Peter, earl of Savoy, and Richmond,\r\nson to Thomas, earl of Savoy, brother to Boniface, archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, and uncle unto Eleanor, wife to King Henry III.\r\n\r\nHe first built this house in the year 1245; and here is occasion\r\noffered me for satisfying of some deniers thereof, to prove that this\r\nPeter of Savoy was also earl of Savoy: wherefore, out of a book of the\r\ngenealogies of all the whole house of Savoy, compiled by Phillebert\r\nPingonio, baron of Guzani, remaining in the hands of W. Smith, alias\r\nRougedragon, officer of arms, I have gathered this:--Thomas, earl of\r\nSavoy, had issue by Beatrix, daughter to Aimon, earl of Geneva, nine\r\nsons and three daughters. Amades, his first son, succeeded earl of Savoy\r\nin the year 1253; Peter, his second son, earl of Savoy and of Richmond,\r\nin 1268; Philip, his third son, earl of Savoy and Burgundie, 1284;\r\nThomas, the fourth, earl of Flanders and prince of Piemont; Boniface,\r\nthe eighth, archbishop of Canterbury; Beatrix, his daughter, married to\r\nRaymond Beringarius of Aragon, earl of Province and Narbone, had issue,\r\nand was mother to five queens: the first, Margaret, wife to Lewes, king\r\nof France; the second, Eleanor, wife to Henry III. king of England;\r\nthe third, Sanctia, wife to Richard, king of the Romans; the fourth,\r\nBeatrix, wife to Charles, king of Naples; the fifth, Johanna, wife to\r\nPhilip, king of Navarre.\r\n\r\nTo return again to the house of Savoy: Queen Eleanor, wife to king Henry\r\nIII., purchased this place afterwards of the fraternity or brethren of\r\nMontjoy;[287] unto whom Peter of Savoy, as it seemeth, had given it,\r\nfor her son, Edmond earl of Lancaster (as M. Camden hath noted out of\r\na register-book of the dukes of Lancaster). Henry, duke of Lancaster,\r\nrepaired or rather new built it, with the charges of fifty-two thousand\r\nmarks, which money he had gathered together at the town of Bridgerike.\r\nJohn, the French king, was lodged there in the year 1357, and also in\r\nthe year 1363; for it was at that time the fairest manor in England.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1381, the rebels of Kent and Essex burnt this house; unto\r\nthe which there was none in the realm to be compared in beauty and\r\nstateliness (saith mine author).[288] They set fire on it round about,\r\nand made proclamation that none, on pain to lose his head, should\r\nconvert to his own use anything that there was, but that they should\r\nbreak such plate and vessels of gold and silver as was found in that\r\nhouse (which was in great plenty) into small pieces, and throw the same\r\ninto the river of Thames: precious stones they should bruise in mortars,\r\nthat the same might be to no use, and so it was done by them. One of\r\ntheir companions they burnt in the fire, because he minded to have\r\nreserved one goodly piece of plate.[289]\r\n\r\nThey found there certain barrels of gunpowder, which they thought had\r\nbeen gold or silver, and throwing them into the fire more suddenly\r\nthan they thought, the hall was blown up, the houses destroyed, and\r\nthemselves very hardly escaped away.\r\n\r\nThis house being thus defaced, and almost overthrown by these rebels\r\nfor malice they bare to John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, of latter\r\ntime came to the king’s hands, and was again raised and beautifully\r\nbuilt for an hospital of St. John Baptist by King Henry VII. about\r\nthe year 1509, for the which hospital, retaining still the old name\r\nof Savoy, he purchased lands to be employed upon the relieving of a\r\nhundred poor people. This hospital being valued to dispend five hundred\r\nand twenty-nine pounds fifteen shillings, etc. by year, was suppressed\r\nthe tenth of June, the 7th of Edward VI.: the beds, bedding, and other\r\nfurniture belonging thereunto, with seven hundred marks of the said\r\nlands by year, he gave to the citizens of London, with his house of\r\nBridewell, to the furnishing thereof, to be a workhouse for the poor and\r\nidle persons, and towards the furnishing of the hospital of St. Thomas\r\nin Southwark, lately suppressed.\r\n\r\nThis hospital of Savoy was again new founded, erected, corporated, and\r\nendowed with lands by Queen Mary, the third of November: in the 4th of\r\nher reign, one Jackson took possession, and was made master thereof\r\nin the same month of November. The ladies of the court and maidens of\r\nhonour (a thing not to be forgotten) stored the same of new with beds,\r\nbedding, and other furniture, in very ample manner, etc.; and it was by\r\npatent so confirmed at Westminster the 9th of May, the 4th and 5th of\r\nPhilip and Mary. The chapel of this hospital serveth now as a parish\r\nchurch to the tenements thereof near adjoining, and others.\r\n\r\nThe next was sometime the bishop of Carlisle’s inn, which now belongeth\r\nto the earl of Bedford, and is called Russell or Bedford house. It\r\nstretcheth from the hospital of Savoy, west to Ivie bridge, where Sir\r\nRobert Cecill, principal secretary to her majesty, hath lately raised a\r\nlarge and stately house of brick and timber, as also levelled and paved\r\nthe highway near adjoining, to the great beautifying of that street and\r\ncommodity of passengers. Richard II., in the 8th of his reign, granted\r\nlicense to pave with stone the highway called Strand street from Temple\r\nbar to the Savoy, and toll to be taken towards the charges; and again\r\nthe like was granted in the 42nd of Henry VI.\r\n\r\nIvie bridge, in the high street, which had a way under it leading down\r\nto the Thames, the like as sometime had the Strand bridge, is now taken\r\ndown, but the lane remaineth as afore, or better, and parteth the\r\nliberty of the duchy and the city of Westminster on that south side.\r\n\r\nNow to begin again at Temple bar, over against it.[290] In the high\r\nstreet, as is afore showed, is one large Middle row of houses and small\r\ntenements built, partly opening to the south, partly towards the north;\r\namongst the which standeth the parish church of St. Clement Danes, so\r\ncalled because Harold, a Danish king, and other Danes, were buried\r\nthere. This Harold, whom king Canutus had by a concubine, reigned three\r\nyears, and was buried at Westminster; but afterward Hardicanutus, the\r\nlawful son of Canutus, in revenge of a displeasure done to his mother,\r\nby expelling her out of the realm, and the murder of his brother\r\nAllured, commanded the body of Harold to be digged out of the earth,\r\nand to be thrown into the Thames, where it was by a fisherman taken up\r\nand buried in this churchyard; but out of a fair ledger-book, sometime\r\nbelonging to the abbey of Chartsey, in the county of Surrey, is noted,\r\nas in Francis Thin, after this sort. In the reign of king Etheldred,\r\nthe monastery of Chartsey was destroyed: ninety monks of that house\r\nwere slain by the Danes, whose bodies were buried in a place next to\r\nthe old monastery. William Malmseberie saith,--“They burnt the church,\r\ntogether with the monks and abbot; but the Danes continuing in their\r\nfury (throughout the whole land), desirous at the length to return home\r\ninto Denmarke, were by the just judgment of God all slain at London in a\r\nplace which is called the church of the Danes.”\r\n\r\nThis said middle row of houses stretching west to a stone cross, now\r\nheadless, by or against the Strand, including the said parish church of\r\nSt. Clement, is also wholly of the liberty and duchy of Lancaster.\r\n\r\nThus much for the bounds and antiquities of this liberty, wherein I\r\nhave noted parish churches twain, sometime three, houses of name six;\r\nto wit, the Savoy or Lancaster house, now a hospital, Somerset house,\r\nEssex house, Arundel house, Bedford or Russell house, and Sir Robert\r\nCecil’s house; besides of Chester’s inn or Strand inn, sometime an inn\r\nof Chancery, etc. This liberty is governed by the chancellor of that\r\nduchy at this present, Sir Robert Cecil, knight, principal secretary to\r\nher majesty, and one of her majesty’s most honourable privy councillors;\r\nthere is under him a steward that keepeth court and leet for the queen;\r\ngiveth the charge and taketh the oaths of every under officer: then is\r\nthere four burgesses and four assistants, to take up controversies;\r\na bailiff, which hath two or three under-bailiffs, that make arrests\r\nwithin that liberty; four constables; four wardens, that keep the lands\r\nand stock for the poor; four wardens for highways; a jury or inquest of\r\nfourteen or sixteen, to present defaults; four ale-conners, which look\r\nto assize of weights and measures, etc.; four scavengers and a beadle;\r\nand their common prison is Newgate. There is in this liberty fifty men,\r\nwhich is always to be at an hour’s warning, with all necessary furniture\r\nto serve the queen, as occasion shall require. Their charge at a fifteen\r\nis thirteen shillings and four pence. Thus much for the suburb in the\r\nliberty of the duchy of Lancaster.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[287] “Fratres de Monte Jovis, or Priory de Cornuto, by Havering at the\r\nBower.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\n[288] H.

This lane turneth\r\nnorth toward St. Giles in the field: from the south end of this lane in\r\nthe high street are divers fair buildings, hosteries, and houses for\r\ngentlemen and men of honour; amongst the which Cicile house is one,\r\nwhich sometime belonged to the parson of St. Martin’s in the field, and\r\nby composition came to Sir Thomas Palmer, knight, in the reign of Edward\r\nVI., who began to build the same of brick and timber, very large and\r\nspacious, but of later time it hath been far more beautifully increased\r\nby the late Sir William Cicile, baron of Burghley, lord treasurer, and\r\ngreat councillor of the estate.\r\n\r\nFrom thence is now a continual new building of divers fair houses,\r\neven up to the earl of Bedford’s house,[291] lately built nigh to Ivy\r\nbridge, and so on the north side to a lane that turneth to the parish\r\nchurch of St. Martin’s in the field, in the liberty of Westminster. Then\r\nhad ye one house, wherein sometime were distraught and lunatic people,\r\nof what antiquity founded or by whom I have not read, neither of the\r\nsuppression; but it was said that sometime a king of England, not liking\r\nsuch a kind of people to remain so near his palace, caused them to be\r\nremoved farther off, to Bethlem without Bishops gate of London, and to\r\nthat hospital: the said house by Charing cross doth yet remain.\r\n\r\nThen is the Mewse, so called of the king’s falcons there kept by the\r\nking’s falconer, which of old time was an office of great account,\r\nas appeareth by a record of Richard II., in the first year of his\r\nreign. Sir Simon Burley, knight, was made constable for the castles of\r\nWindsor, Wigmore, and Guilford, and of the manor of Kenington, and also\r\nmaster of the king’s falcons at the Mewse, near unto Charing cross by\r\nWestminster; but in the year of Christ 1534, the 28th of Henry VIII.,\r\nthe king having fair stabling at Lomsbery (a manor in the farthest west\r\npart of Oldborne), the same was fired and burnt, with many great horses\r\nand great store of hay: after which time, the fore-named house, called\r\nthe Mewse by Charing cross, was new built, and prepared for stabling of\r\nthe king’s horses, in the reign of Edward VI. and Queen Mary, and so\r\nremaineth to that use: and this is the farthest building west on the\r\nnorth side of that high street.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of the which street, in the liberties of Westminster\r\n(beginning at Ivie bridge), first is Durham house, built by Thomas\r\nHatfielde, bishop of Durham, who was made bishop of that see in the year\r\n1545, and sat bishop there thirty-six years.\r\n\r\nAmongst matters memorable concerning this house, this is one:--In the\r\nyear of Christ 1540, the 32nd of Henry VIII., on May-day, a great and\r\ntriumphant justing was holden at Westminster, which had been formerly\r\nproclaimed in France, Flanders, Scotland, and Spain, for all comers that\r\nwould undertake the challengers of England; which were, Sir John Dudley,\r\nSir Thomas Seymour, Sir Thomas Ponings, and Sir George Carew, knights,\r\nand Anthonie Kingston and Richarde Cromwell, esquires; all which came\r\ninto the lists that day richly apparelled, and their horses trapped\r\nall in white velvet. There came against them the said day forty-six\r\ndefendants or undertakers, viz., the earl of Surrey, foremost, Lord\r\nWilliam Howard, Lord Clinton, and Lord Cromwell, son and heir to Thomas\r\nCromwell, earl of Essex, and chamberlain of England, with other; and\r\nthat day, after the justs performed, the challengers rode unto this\r\nDurham house, where they kept open household, and feasted the king and\r\nqueen, with her ladies, and all the court: the second day, Anthonie\r\nKingston and Richard Cromwell were made knights there: the third day\r\nof May the said challengers did tournay on horseback with swords, and\r\nagainst them came forty-nine defendants; Sir John Dudley and the earl of\r\nSurrey running first, which at the first course lost their gauntlets;\r\nand that day Sir Richarde Cromwell overthrew master Palmer and his horse\r\nin the field, to the great honour of the challengers: the fifth of May\r\nthe challengers fought on foot at the barriers, and against them came\r\nfifty defendants, which fought valiantly; but Sir Richard Cromwell\r\noverthrew that day at the barriers master Culpepper in the field; and\r\nthe sixth day the challengers brake up their household.\r\n\r\nIn this time of their housekeeping they had not only feasted the\r\nking, queen, ladies, and all the court, as is afore shewed; but also\r\nthey cheered all the knights and burgesses of the common house in the\r\nparliament, and entertained the mayor of London, with the aldermen,\r\nand their wives, at a dinner, etc. The king gave to every of the said\r\nchallengers, and their heirs for ever, in reward of their valiant\r\nactivity, one hundred marks and a house to dwell in, of yearly revenue,\r\nout of the lands pertaining to the hospital of St. John of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nNext beyond this Durham house is another great house, sometime\r\nbelonging to the bishop of Norwich, and was his London lodging, which\r\nnow pertaineth to the archbishop of York by this occasion. In the\r\nyear 1529, when Cardinal Wolsey, archbishop of Yorke, was indicted in\r\nthe Premunire, whereby King Henry VIII. was entitled to his goods and\r\npossessions: he also seized into his hands the said archbishop’s house,\r\ncommonly called Yorke place, and changed the name thereof into White\r\nhall; whereby the archbishops of Yorke being dispossessed, and having no\r\nhouse of repair about London, Queen Mary gave unto Nicholas Heath, then\r\narchbishop of Yorke, and to his successors, Suffolke house in Southwark,\r\nlately built by Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolke, as I have showed.\r\n\r\nThis house the said archbishop sold, and bought the aforesaid house\r\nof old time belonging to the bishops of Norwich, which of this last\r\npurchase is now called Yorke house, the lord chancellors or lord keepers\r\nof the great seal of England, have been lately there lodged.\r\n\r\nThen was there an hospital of St. Marie Rouncivall by Charing cross\r\n(a cell to the priory and covent of Rouncivall in Navar, in Pampelion\r\ndiocese), where a fraternity was founded in the 15th of Edward IV., but\r\nnow the same is suppressed and turned into tenements.\r\n\r\nNear unto this hospital was a hermitage, with a chapel of St. Katherine,\r\nover against Charing cross; which cross, built of stone, was of old time\r\na fair piece of work, there made by commandment of Edward I., in the\r\n21st year of his reign, in memory of Eleanor, his deceased queen, as is\r\nbefore declared.\r\n\r\nWest from this cross stood sometime an hospital of St. James, consisting\r\nof two hides of land, with the appurtenances, in the parish of St.\r\nMargaret in Westminster, and founded by the citizens of London, before\r\nthe time of any man’s memory, for fourteen sisters, maidens, that were\r\nleprous, living chastely and honestly in divine service.\r\n\r\nAfterwards divers citizens of London gave five-and-fifty pounds rent\r\nthereunto, and then were adjoined eight brethren to minister divine\r\nservice there. After this, also, sundry devout men of London gave to\r\nthis hospital four hides of land in the field of Westminster; and in\r\nHendon, Calcote, and Hampsted, eighty acres of land and wood, etc. King\r\nEdward I. confirmed those gifts, and granted a fair to be kept on the\r\neve of St. James, the day, the morrow, and four days following, in the\r\n18th of his reign.\r\n\r\nThis hospital was surrendered to Henry VIII. the 23rd of his reign: the\r\nsisters being compounded with, were allowed pensions for the term of\r\ntheir lives; and the king built there a goodly manor, annexing thereunto\r\na park, closed about with a wall of brick, now called St. James’ park,\r\nserving indifferently to the said manor, and to the manor or palace of\r\nWhite hall.\r\n\r\nSouth from Charing cross, on the right hand, are divers fair houses\r\nlately built before the park, then a large tilt-yard for noblemen, and\r\nother, to exercise themselves in justing, turning, and fighting at\r\nbarriers.\r\n\r\nOn the left hand from Charing cross be also divers fair tenements lately\r\nbuilt, till ye come to a large plot of ground inclosed with brick, and\r\nis called Scotland, where great buildings have been for receipt of the\r\nkings of Scotland, and other estates of that country; for Margaret,\r\nqueen of Scots, and sister to King Henry VIII., had her abiding there,\r\nwhen she came into England after the death of her husband, as the kings\r\nof Scotland had in former times, when they came to the parliament of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThen is the said White hall, sometime belonging to Hubert de Burgh,\r\nearl of Kent, and justice of England, who gave it to the Black Friars\r\nin Oldborne, as I have before noted. King Henry VIII. ordained it to be\r\ncalled an honour, and built there a sumptuous gallery and a beautiful\r\ngate-house, thwart the high street to St. James’ park, etc.\r\n\r\nIn this gallery the princes, with their nobility, used to stand or sit,\r\nand at windows, to behold all triumphant justings and other military\r\nexercises.\r\n\r\nBeyond this gallery, on the left hand, is the garden or orchard\r\nbelonging to the said White hall.\r\n\r\nOn the right hand be divers fair tennis-courts, bowling-alleys, and a\r\ncock-pit, all built by King Henry VIII.; and then one other arched\r\ngate, with a way over it, thwarting the street from the king’s gardens\r\nto the said park.\r\n\r\nFrom this gate up King’s street to a bridge over Long ditch (so called\r\nfor that the same almost insulateth the city of Westminster), near\r\nwhich bridge is a way leading to Chanon row, so called for that the\r\nsame belonged to the dean and chanons of St. Stephen’s chapel, who were\r\nthere lodged, as now divers noblemen and gentlemen be; whereof one is\r\nbelonging to Sir Edward Hobbey, one other to John Thine, esquire, one\r\nstately built by Ann Stanhope, duchess of Somerset, mother to the earl\r\nof Hartford, who now enjoyeth that house. Next a stately house, now in\r\nbuilding by William earl of Darby; over against the which is a fair\r\nhouse, built by Henry Clinton, earl of Lincoln.\r\n\r\nFrom this way up to the Woolestaple and to the high tower, or gate\r\nwhich entereth the palace court, all is replenished with buildings and\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nTouching this Woolestaple, I read, that in the reign of Edward I.,\r\nthe staple being at Westminster, the parishioners of St. Margaret and\r\nmerchants of the staple built of new the said church, the great chancel\r\nexcepted, which was lately before new built by the abbot of Westminster.\r\n\r\nMoreover, that Edward III., in the 17th of his reign, decreed that no\r\nsilver be carried out of the realm on pain of death; and that whosoever\r\ntransporteth wool should bring over for every sack four nobles of silver\r\nbullion.\r\n\r\nIn the 25th of his reign, he appointed the staple of wool to be kept\r\nonly at Canterbury, for the honour of St. Thomas; but in the 27th\r\nof the same King Edward, the staple of wool, before kept at Bruges\r\nin Flanders, was ordained by parliament to be kept in divers places\r\nof England, Wales, and Ireland, as at Newcastle, Yorke, Lincoln,\r\nCanterbury, Norwich, Westminster, Chichester, Winchester, Excester,\r\nBristow, Carmardyn, etc., to the great benefit of the king and loss unto\r\nstrangers and merchants: for there grew unto the king by this means\r\n(as it was said) the sum of one thousand one hundred and two pounds\r\nby the year, more than any his predecessors before had received; the\r\nstaple at Westminster at that time began on the next morrow after the\r\nfeast of St. Peter ad vincula. The next year was granted to the king by\r\nparliament, towards the recovery of his title in France, fifty shillings\r\nof every sack of wool transported over seas, for the space of six years\r\nnext ensuing; by means whereof the king might dispend daily during\r\nthose years more than a thousand marks sterling: for by the common\r\nopinion there were more than one hundred thousand sacks of wool yearly\r\ntransported into foreign lands, so that during six years the said grant\r\nextended to fifteen hundred thousand pounds sterling.\r\n\r\nIn the 37th of Edward III., it was granted unto him for two years, to\r\ntake five-and-twenty shillings and eight pence upon every sack of wool\r\ntransported; and the same year the staple of wool (notwithstanding the\r\nking’s oath and other great estates) was ordained to be kept at Callis,\r\nand six-and-twenty merchants, the best and wealthiest of all England, to\r\nbe farmers there, both of the town and staple, for three years: every\r\nmerchant to have six men of arms and four archers at the king’s cost. He\r\nordained there also two mayors, one for the town and one for the staple;\r\nand he took for _mala capta_, commonly called Maltorth,[292] twenty\r\nshillings, and of the said merchants’ guardians of the town forty pence,\r\nupon every sack of wool.\r\n\r\nIn the 44th of Edward III., Quinborough, Kingston-upon-Hull, and Boston,\r\nwere made staples of wool; which matter so much offended some, that in\r\nthe 50th of his reign, in a parliament at London, it was complained\r\nthat the staple of wool was so removed from Callis to divers towns in\r\nEngland, contrary to the statute, appointing that citizens and merchants\r\nshould keep it there, and that the king might have the profits and\r\ncustoms, with the exchange of gold and silver, that was there made by\r\nall the merchants in Christindome (esteemed to amount to eight thousand\r\npounds by year), the exchange only; and the citizens and merchants so\r\nordered the matter, that the king spent nothing upon soldiers, neither\r\nupon defence of the town against the enemies; whereas now he spent eight\r\nthousand pounds by year.\r\n\r\nIn the 51st of Edward III., when the staple was sealed at Callis, the\r\nmayor of the staple did furnish the captain of the town upon any road\r\nwith one hundred bilmen, twelve hundred archers of merchants and their\r\nservants, without any wages.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1388, the 12th of Richard II., in a parliament at Cambridge,\r\nit was ordained that the staple of wools should be brought from\r\nMiddleborough in Holland to Callis.\r\n\r\nIn the 14th of his reign, there was granted forty shillings upon every\r\nsack of wool, and in the 21st was granted fifty shillings upon every\r\nsack transported by Englishmen, and three pounds by strangers, etc. It\r\nseemeth that the merchants of this staple be the most ancient merchants\r\nof this realm; and that all commodities of the realm are staple\r\nmerchandises by law and charter as wools, leather, wool fells, lead,\r\ntin, cloth, etc.\r\n\r\nKing Henry VI. had six wool-houses within the staple at Westminster:\r\nthose he granted to the dean and canons of St. Stephen at Westminster,\r\nand confirmed it the 21st of his reign. Thus much for the staple have I\r\nshortly noted.\r\n\r\nAnd now to pass to the famous monastery of Westminster: at the very\r\nentrance of the close thereof, is a lane that leadeth toward the\r\nwest, called Thieving lane, for that thieves were led that way to the\r\ngate-house, while the sanctuary continued in force.\r\n\r\nThis monastery was founded and built by Sebert,[293] king of the East\r\nSaxons, upon the persuasion of Ethelbert, king of Kent, how having\r\nembraced Christianity, and being baptised by Melitus, bishop of London,\r\nimmediately (to show himself a Christian indeed) built a church to the\r\nhonour of God and St. Peter, on the west side of the city of London,\r\nin a place which (because it was overgrown with thorns, and environed\r\nwith water) the Saxons called Thorney, and now of the monastery and west\r\nsituation thereof is called Westminster.\r\n\r\nIn this place (saith Sulcardus) long before was a temple of Apollo,\r\nwhich being overthrown, King Lucius built therein a church of\r\nChristianity.\r\n\r\nSebert was buried in this church, with his wife Athelgoda; whose\r\nbodies many years after, to wit, in the reign of Richard II. (saith\r\nWalsingham), were translated from the old church to the new, and there\r\nentered.\r\n\r\nEdgar, king of the West Saxons, repaired this monastery about the year\r\nof Christ 958; Edward the Confessor built it of new, whereupon T.\r\nClifford writeth thus:\r\n\r\n“Without the walls of London (saith he), upon the river of Thames,\r\nthere was in times passed a little monastery, built to the honour of\r\nGod and St. Peter, with a few Benedict monks in it, under an abbot,\r\nserving Christ: very poor they were, and little was given them for their\r\nrelief. Here the king intended (for that it was near to the famous\r\ncity of London and the river of Thames, that brought in all kinds of\r\nmerchandises from all parts of the world) to make his sepulchre: he\r\ncommanded, therefore, that of the tenths of all his rents the work\r\nshould be begun in such sort as should become the prince of the Apostles.\r\n\r\n“At this his commandment the work is nobly begun, even from the\r\nfoundation, and happily proceedeth till the same was finished: the\r\ncharges bestowed, or to be bestowed, are not regarded. He granted to\r\nthis church great privileges, above all the churches in this land, as\r\npartly appeareth by this his charter:--\r\n\r\n    “Edwarde, king, greets William, bishop, and Leofstane, and\r\n    Aelsie Portreves, and all my burgesses of London friendly, and I\r\n    tell you, that I have this gift given and granted to Christ and St.\r\n    Peter the holy Apostle, at Westminster, full freedome over all the\r\n    land that belongeth to that holy place, etc.”\r\n\r\nHe also caused the parish church of St. Margaret to be newly built\r\nwithout the abbey church of Westminster, for the ease and commodity of\r\nthe monks, because before that time the parish church stood within the\r\nold abbey church in the south aisle, somewhat to their annoyance.\r\n\r\nKing Henry III., in the year of Christ 1220, and in the 5th of his\r\nreign, began the new work of our Lady’s chapel, whereof he laid the\r\nfirst stone in the foundation; and in the year 1245, the walls and\r\nsteeple of the old church (built by King Edward) were taken down, and\r\nenlarging the same church, caused them to be made more comely; for the\r\nfurtherance whereof, in the year 1246, the same king (devising how to\r\nextort money from the citizens of London towards the charges) appointed\r\na mart to be kept at Westminster, the same to last fifteen days, and\r\nin the mean space all trade of merchandise to cease in the city; which\r\nthing the citizens were fain to redeem with two thousand pounds of\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\nThe work of this church, with the houses of office, was finished to the\r\nend of the choir, in the year 1285, the 14th of Edward I.: all which\r\nlabour of sixty-six years was in the year 1299 defaced by a fire kindled\r\nin the lesser hall of the king’s palace at Westminster; the same, with\r\nmany other houses adjoining, and with the queen’s chamber, were all\r\nconsumed; the flame thereof also (being driven with the wind), fired the\r\nmonastery, which was also with the palace consumed.\r\n\r\nThen was this monastery again repaired by the abbots of that church;\r\nKing Edward I. and his successors putting to their helping hands.\r\n\r\nEdward II. appropriated unto this church the patronages of the churches\r\nof Kelveden and Sawbridgeworth in Essex, in the diocese of London.\r\n\r\nSimon Langham, abbot (having been a great builder there in the year\r\n1362), gave forty pounds to the building of the body of the church; but\r\n(amongst others) Abbot Islip was in his time a great builder there, as\r\nmay appear in the stonework and glass windows of the church; since whose\r\ndecease that work hath staid as he left it, unperfected, the church and\r\nsteeple being all of one height.\r\n\r\nKing Henry VII., about the year of Christ 1502, caused the chapel of\r\nour Lady, built by Henry III., with a tavern also, called the White\r\nRose, near adjoining, to be taken down: in which plot of ground, on\r\nthe 24th of January, the first stone of the new chapel was laid by the\r\nhands of Abbot Islip, Sir Reginald Bray, knight of the garter, Doctor\r\nBarnes, master of the Rolls, Doctor Wall, chaplain to the king, Master\r\nHugh Aldham, chaplain to the countess of Darby and Richmond (the king’s\r\nmother), Sir Edward Stanhope, knight, and divers other: upon the which\r\nstone was engraven the same day and year, etc.\r\n\r\nThe charges in building this chapel amounted to the sum of fourteen\r\nthousand pounds. The stone for this work (as I have been informed) was\r\nbrought from Huddlestone quarry in Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nThe altar and sepulture of the same King Henry VII., wherein his body\r\nresteth in this his new chapel, was made and finished in the year 1519\r\nby one Peter, a painter of Florence; for the which he received one\r\nthousand pounds sterling for the whole stuff and workmanship at the\r\nhands of the king’s executors; Richard, bishop of Winchester; Richard,\r\nbishop of London; Thomas, bishop of Durham; John, bishop of Rochester;\r\nThomas, duke of Norfolk, treasurer of England; Charles, earl of\r\nWorcester, the king’s chamberlain; John Fineaux, knight, chief justice\r\nof the King’s bench; Robert Reade, knight, chief justice of the Common\r\nPleas.\r\n\r\nThis monastery being valued to dispend by the year three thousand four\r\nhundred and seventy pounds, etc., was surrendered to Henry VIII. in\r\nthe year 1539. Benson, then abbot, was made the first dean, and not\r\nlong after it was advanced to a bishop’s see in the year 1541. Thomas\r\nThirlby being both the first and last bishop there, who, when he had\r\nimpoverished the church, was translated to Norwich in the year 1550, the\r\n4th of Edward VI., and from thence to Elie in the year 1554, the 2nd of\r\nQueen Mary. Richard Cox, doctor in divinity (late schoolmaster to King\r\nEdward VI.), was made dean of Westminster, whom Queen Mary put out, and\r\nmade Doctor Wonest dean until the year 1556, and then he being removed\r\nfrom thence on the 21st of November, John Feckenham (late dean of\r\nPauls) was made abbot of Westminster, and took possession of the same,\r\nbeing installed, and fourteen monks more received the habit with him\r\nthat day of the order of St. Benedict; but the said John Feckenham, with\r\nhis monks, enjoyed not that place fully three years, for in the year\r\n1559, in the month of July, they were all put out, and Queen Elizabeth\r\nmade the said monastery a college, instituting there a dean, twelve\r\nprebends, a schoolmaster, and usher, forty scholars, called commonly the\r\nQueen’s scholars, twelve alms men; and so it was named the Collegiate\r\nchurch of Westminster, founded by Queen Elizabeth, who placed Doctor\r\nBill,[294] first dean of that new erection; after whom succeeded Doctor\r\nGabriel Goodman, who governed that church forty years, and after Doctor\r\nLancelot Andrewes.\r\n\r\nKings and queens crowned in this church: William, surnamed the\r\nConqueror, and Matilde his wife, were the first, and since them all\r\nother kings and queens of this realm have been there crowned.\r\n\r\nKings and queens buried in this church are these: Sebert, king of the\r\nEast Saxons, with his wife Athelgede; Harold, surnamed Harefoot, king of\r\nthe West Saxons; Edward the Simple, surnamed Confessor, sometime richly\r\nshrined in a tomb of silver and gold, curiously wrought by commandment\r\nof William the Conqueror; Egitha his wife was there buried also;\r\nHugolyn, chamberlain to Edward the Confessor; King Henry III., whose\r\nsepulture was richly garnished with precious stones of jasper, which his\r\nson Edward I. brought out of France for that purpose; Eleanor, wife to\r\nHenry III.; Edward I., who offered to the shrine of Edward the Confessor\r\nthe chair of marble, wherein the kings of Scotland were crowned, with\r\nthe sceptre and crown, also to the same king belonging.\r\n\r\nHe gave also to that church lands to the value of one hundred pounds by\r\nthe year; twenty pounds thereof yearly to be distributed to the poor\r\nfor ever. Then there lieth Eleanor, his wife, daughter to Ferdinando,\r\nking of Castile, 1293; Edward III. by Queen Philippa of Henault his\r\nwife; Richard II. and Anne his wife, with their images upon them, which\r\ncost more than four hundred marks for the gilding; Henry V., with a\r\nroyal image of silver and gilt, which Katherine his wife caused to be\r\nlaid upon him, but the head of this image being of massy silver, is\r\nbroken off, and conveyed away with the plates of silver and gilt that\r\ncovered his body; Katherine, his wife, was buried in the old Lady\r\nchapel 1438, but her corpse being taken up in the reign of Henry VII.,\r\nwhen a new foundation was to be laid, she was never since buried, but\r\nremaineth above ground in a coffin of boards behind the east end of\r\nthe presbytery; Henry VII. in a sumptuous sepulture and chapel before\r\nspecified, and Elizabeth his wife; Edward VI. in the same chapel,\r\nwithout any monument; Queen Mary, without any monument, in the same\r\nchapel; Matilde, daughter to Malcolm, king of Scots, wife to Henry I.,\r\ndied 1118, lieth in the revestry; Anne, wife to Richard III.; Margaret,\r\ncountess of Richmond and Darby, mother to Henry VII.; Anne of Cleves,\r\nwife to Henry VIII.; Edmond, second son to Henry III., first earl of\r\nLancaster, Darby, and Leycester, and Aveline his wife, daughter and heir\r\nto William de Fortibus, earl of Albemarle. In St. Thomas’ chapel lie the\r\nbones of the children of Henry III. and of Edward I., in number nine.\r\nIn the chapter-house,--Elianor, countess of Barre, daughter to Edward\r\nI.; William of Windsor, and Blaunch his sister, children to Edward III.;\r\nJohn of Eltham, earl of Cornewell, son to Edward II.;

corrected and\r\ntwice increased, through mine own painful labours, in the reign of Queen\r\nElizabeth, to wit, in the year 1561; and again beautified with notes by\r\nme, collected out of divers records and monuments, which I delivered to\r\nmy loving friend, Thomas Speght; and he having drawn the same into a\r\ngood form and method, as also explained the old and obscure words, etc.,\r\nhath published them in anno 1597.\r\n\r\nAnne Stanhope, duchess of Somerset, and Jane her daughter;

from whence\r\nit hath not been lawful for any prince or other to take any person that\r\nfled thither for any cause: which privilege was first granted by Sebert,\r\nking of the East Saxons, since increased by Edgar, king of the West\r\nSaxons, renewed and confirmed by King Edward the Confessor, as appeareth\r\nby this his charter following:\r\n\r\n“Edward, by the grace of God, king of Englishmen: I make it to be known\r\nto all generations of the world after me, that by speciall commandement\r\nof our holy father, Pope Leo, I have renewed and honored the holy\r\nchurch of the blessed apostle St. Peter, of Westminster; and I order\r\nand establish for ever, that what person, of what condition or estate\r\nsoever he be, from whence soever he come, or for what offence or cause\r\nit be, either for his refuge into the said holy place, he be assured of\r\nhis life, liberty, and limbs. And over this I forbid, under the paine of\r\neverlasting damnation, that no minister of mine, or of my successors,\r\nintermeddle them with any the goods, lands, or possessions of the said\r\npersons taking the said sanctuary; for I have taken their goodes and\r\nlivelode into my special protection, and therefore I grant to every each\r\nof them, in as much as my terrestriall power may suffice, all maner\r\nfreedom of joyous libertie; and whosoever presumes or doth contrary to\r\nthis my graunt, I will hee lose his name, worship, dignity, and power,\r\nand that with the great traytor Judas that betraied our Saviour, he be\r\nin the everlasting fire of hell; and I will and ordayne that this my\r\ngraunt endure as long as there remayneth in England eyther love or dread\r\nof Christian name.”\r\n\r\nMore of this sanctuary ye may read in our histories, and also in the\r\nstatute of Henry VIII., the 32nd year.\r\n\r\nThe parish church of St. Margaret, sometime within the abbey, was\r\nby Edward the Confessor removed, and built without, for ease of the\r\nmonks. This church continued till the days of Edward I., at which time\r\nthe merchants of the staple and parishioners of Westminster built it\r\nall of new, the great chancel excepted, which was built by the abbots\r\nof Westminster; and this remaineth now a fair parish church, though\r\nsometime in danger of down pulling. In the south aisle of this church is\r\na fair marble monument of Dame Mary Billing, the heir of Robert Nesenham\r\nof Conington, in Huntingdonshire, first married to William Cotton, to\r\nwhose issue her inheritance alone descended, remaining with Robert\r\nCotton at this day, heir of her and her first husband’s family; her\r\nsecond husband was Sir Thomas Billing, chief justice of England; and her\r\nlast, whom likewise she buried, was Thomas Lacy; erecting this monument\r\nto the memory of her three husbands, with whose arms she hath garnished\r\nit, and for her own burial, wherein she was interred in the year 1499.\r\n\r\nNext to this famous monastery is the king’s principal palace, of what\r\nantiquity it is uncertain; but Edward the Confessor held his court\r\nthere, as may appear by the testimony of sundry, and, namely, of\r\nIngulphus, as I have before told you. The said king had his palace, and\r\nfor the most part remained there; where he also so ended his life, and\r\nwas buried in the monastery which he had built. It is not to be doubted\r\nbut that King William I., as he was crowned there, so he built much at\r\nhis palace, for he found it far inferior to the building of princely\r\npalaces in France: and it is manifest, by the testimony of many authors,\r\nthat William Rufus built the great hall there about the year of Christ\r\n1097. Amongst others, Roger of Wendover and Mathew Paris do write, that\r\nKing William (being returned out of Normandy into England) kept his\r\nfeast of Whitsontide very royally at Westminster, in the new hall which\r\nhe had lately built; the length whereof (say some) was two hundred and\r\nseventy feet, and seventy-four feet in breadth; and when he heard men\r\nsay that this hall was too great, he answered and said, “This hall is\r\nnot big enough by the one half, and is but a bed-chamber in comparison\r\nof that I mean to make.” A diligent searcher (saith Paris) might find\r\nout the foundation of the hall, which he was supposed to have built,\r\nstretching from the river of Thames, even to the common highway.\r\n\r\nThis palace was repaired about the year 1163 by Thomas Becket,\r\nchancellor of England, with exceeding great celerity and speed, which\r\nbefore was ready to have fallen down. This hath been the principal seat\r\nand palace of all the kings of England since the Conquest; for here have\r\nthey in the great hall kept their feasts of coronation especially, and\r\nother solemn feasts, as at Christmas and such like, most commonly: for\r\nproof whereof, I find recorded, that in the year 1236, and the 20th of\r\nHenry, III., on the 29th of December, William de Haverhull, the king’s\r\ntreasurer, is commanded, that upon the day of circumcision of our Lord,\r\nhe caused six thousand poor people to be fed at Westminster, for the\r\nstate of the king, the queen, and their children; the weak and aged to\r\nbe placed in the great hall and in the lesser; those that were most\r\nstrong, and in reasonable plight, in the king’s chamber; the children in\r\nthe queen’s; and when the king knoweth the charge, he would allow it in\r\nthe accounts.[296]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1238, the same King Henry kept his feast of Christmas at\r\nWestminster in the great hall; so did he in the year 1241, where he\r\nplaced the legate in the most honourable place of the table, to wit, in\r\nthe midst, which the noblemen took in evil part: the king sat on the\r\nright hand, and the archbishop on the left, and then all the prelates\r\nand nobles according to their estates; for the king himself set the\r\nguests. The year 1242 he likewise kept his Christmas in the hall, etc.\r\nAlso, in the year 1243, Richard, earl of Cornewall, the king’s brother,\r\nmarried Cincia, daughter to Beatrice, countess of Province, and kept his\r\nmarriage-feast in the great hall at Westminster, with great royalty and\r\ncompany of noblemen: insomuch that there were told (_triginta millia_)\r\nthirty thousand dishes of meats at that dinner.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1256, King Henry sate in the exchequer of this hall, and\r\nthere set down order for the appearance of sheriffs, and bringing in of\r\ntheir accounts: there were five marks set on every sheriff’s head for a\r\nfine, because they had not distrained every person that might dispend\r\nfifteen pounds land by the year to receive the order of knighthood,\r\nas the same sheriffs were commanded. Also, the mayor, aldermen, and\r\nsheriffs of London, being accused of oppression and wrongs done by them,\r\nand submitting themselves in this place before the king sitting in\r\njudgment upon that matter, they were condemned to pay their fines for\r\ntheir offences committed, and further, every one of them discharged of\r\nassise and ward.\r\n\r\nIn the years 1268 and 1269, the same king kept his Christmas feasts\r\nat Westminster as before; and also in the same 1269 he translated\r\nwith great solemnity the body of King Edward the Confessor into a new\r\nchapel, at the back of the high altar: which chapel he had prepared of a\r\nmarvellous workmanship, bestowing a new tomb or shrine of gold; and on\r\nthe day of his translation he kept a royal feast in the great hall of\r\nthe palace. Thus much for the feasts of old time in this hall.\r\n\r\nWe read also, that in the year 1236, the river of Thames overflowing the\r\nbanks, caused the marshes about Woolwitch to be all on a sea, wherein\r\nboats and other vessels were carried with the stream; so that besides\r\ncattle, the greatest number of men, women, and children, inhabitants\r\nthere, were drowned: and in the great palace of Westminster men did row\r\nwith wherries in the midst of the hall, being forced to ride to their\r\nchambers.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in the year 1242, the Thames overflowing the banks about\r\nLambhithe, drowned houses and fields by the space of six miles, so\r\nthat in the great hall at Westminster men took their horses, because\r\nthe water ran over all. This palace was (in the year 1299, the 27th of\r\nEdward I.) burnt by a vehement fire, kindled in the lesser hall of the\r\nking’s house: the same, with many other houses adjoining, and with the\r\nqueen’s chamber, were consumed, but after that repaired.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1313, the 31st of Edward I., the king’s treasury at\r\nWestminster was robbed; for the which, Walter, abbot of Westminster,\r\nwith forty-nine of his brethren and thirty-two other, were thrown into\r\nthe Tower of London, and indicted of the robbery of a hundred thousand\r\npounds; but they affirming themselves to be clear of the fact, and\r\ndesiring the king of speedy justice, a commission was directed for\r\ninquiry of the truth, and they were freed.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1316, Edward II. did solemnize his feast of Penticost at\r\nWestminster, in the great hall; where sitting royally at the table, with\r\nhis peers about him, there entered a woman adorned like a minstrel,\r\nsitting on a great horse, trapped as minstrels then used, who rode\r\nround about the tables, showing pastime, and at length came up to the\r\nking’s table, and laid before him a letter, and forthwith turning her\r\nhorse, saluted every one, and departed. The letter being opened, had\r\nthese contents:,--“Our soveraigne lord and king, hath nothing curteously\r\nrespected his knights, that in his father’s time, and also in his owne,\r\nhave put forth their persons to divers perils, and have utterly lost, or\r\ngreatly diminished their substance, for honor of the said king, and he\r\nhath inriched abundantly such as have not borne the waight as yet of the\r\nbusines, etc.”\r\n\r\nThis great hall was begun to be repaired in the year 1397 by Richard\r\nII., who caused the walls, windows, and roof, to be taken down, and new\r\nmade, with a stately porch, and divers lodgings of a marvellous work,\r\nand with great costs; all which he levied of strangers banished or\r\nflying out of their countries, who obtained license to remain in this\r\nland, by the king’s charters, which they had purchased with great sums\r\nof money; John Boterell being then clerk of the works.\r\n\r\nThis hall being finished in the year 1398, the same king kept a most\r\nroyal Christmas there, with daily justings and runnings at tilt;\r\nwhereunto resorted such a number of people, that there was every day\r\nspent twenty-eight or twenty-six oxen, and three hundred sheep, besides\r\nfowl without number: he caused a gown for himself to be made of gold,\r\ngarnished with pearl and precious stones, to the value of three thousand\r\nmarks: he was guarded by Cheshire men, and had about him commonly\r\nthirteen bishops, besides barons, knights, esquires, and other more\r\nthan needed; insomuch, that to the household came every day to meat ten\r\nthousand people, as appeareth by the messes told out from the kitchen to\r\nthree hundred servitors.\r\n\r\nThus was this great hall, for the honour of the prince, oftentimes\r\nfurnished with guests, not only in this king’s time (a prodigal\r\nprince), but in the time of other also, both before and since, though\r\nnot so usually noted. For when it is said, the king held his feast of\r\nChristmas, or such a feast at Westminster, it may well be supposed to be\r\nkept in this great hall, as most sufficient to such a purpose.\r\n\r\nI find noted by Robert Fabian (sometime an alderman of London), that\r\nKing Henry VII., in the 9th of his reign (holding his royal feast of\r\nChristmas at Westminster), on the twelfth day, feasted Ralph Austry,\r\nthen mayor of London, and his brethren the aldermen, with other\r\ncommoners in great number, and after dinner dubbing the mayor knight,\r\ncaused him with his brethren to stay and behold the disguisings and\r\nother disports in the night following, showed in the great hall,\r\nwhich was richly hanged with arras, and staged about on both sides;\r\nwhich disports being ended in the morning, the king, the queen, the\r\nambassadors, and other estates, being set at a table of stone, sixty\r\nknights and esquires served sixty dishes to the king’s mess, and as\r\nmany to the queen’s (neither flesh nor fish), and served the mayor with\r\ntwenty-four dishes to his mess, of the same manner, with sundry wines\r\nin most plenteous wise: and finally, the king and queen being conveyed\r\nwith great lights into the palace, the mayor with his company in barges\r\nreturned and came to London by break of the next day. Thus much for\r\nbuilding of this great hall, and feasting therein.\r\n\r\nIt moreover appeareth that many parliaments have been kept there; for I\r\nfind noted, that in the year 1397, the great hall at Westminster being\r\nout of reparations, and therefore, as it were, new built by Richard II.\r\n(as is afore showed), the same Richard, in the mean time having occasion\r\nto hold a parliament, caused for that purpose a large house to be built\r\nin the midst of the palace-court, betwixt the clock tower and the gate\r\nof the old great hall. This house was very large and long, made of\r\ntimber, covered with tile, open on both the sides and at both the ends,\r\nthat all men might see and hear what was both said and done.\r\n\r\nThe king’s archers (in number four thousand Cheshire men) compassed the\r\nhouse about with their bows bent, and arrows knocked in their hands,\r\nalways ready to shoot: they had bouch of court (to wit, meat and drink),\r\nand great wages of six pence by the day.\r\n\r\nThe old great hall being new built, parliaments were again there kept\r\nas before:[297] namely, one in the year 1399, for the deposing of\r\nRichard II. A great part of this palace at Westminster was once again\r\nburnt in the year 1512, the 4th of Henry VIII.; since the which time it\r\nhath not been re-edified: only the great hall, with the offices near\r\nadjoining, are kept in good reparations, and serveth as afore for feasts\r\nat coronations, arraignments of great persons charged with treasons,\r\nkeeping of the courts of justice, etc. But the princes have been lodged\r\nin other places about the city, as at Baynarde’s castle, at Bridewell,\r\nand White hall, sometime called York place, and sometime at St. James’.\r\n\r\nThis great hall hath been the usual place of pleadings, and ministration\r\nof justice, whereof somewhat shortly I will note. In times past the\r\ncourts and benches followed the king wheresoever he went, as well since\r\nthe Conquest as before; which thing at length being thought cumbersome,\r\npainful, and chargeable to the people, it was in the year 1224, the 9th\r\nof Henry III., agreed that there should be a standing place appointed,\r\nwhere matters should be heard and judged, which was in the great hall at\r\nWestminster.\r\n\r\nIn this hall he ordained three judgment seats; to wit, at the entry\r\non the right hand, the Common Pleas, where civil matters are to be\r\npleaded, specially such as touch lands or contracts: at the upper end\r\nof the hall, on the right hand, or south-east corner, the King’s Bench,\r\nwhere pleas of the crown have their hearing; and on the left hand, or\r\nsouth-west corner, sitteth the lord chancellor, accompanied with the\r\nmaster of the rolls, and other men, learned for the most part in the\r\ncivil law, and called masters of the chancery, which have the king’s\r\nfee. The times of pleading in these courts are four in the year, which\r\nare called terms: the first is Hillary term, which beginneth the 23rd\r\nof January, if it be not Sunday, and endeth the 12th of February; the\r\nsecond is Easter term, and beginneth seventeen days after Easter day,\r\nand endeth four days after Ascension day; the third term beginneth six\r\nor seven days after Trinity Sunday, and endeth the Wednesday fortnight\r\nafter; the fourth is Michaelmas term, which beginneth the 9th of\r\nOctober, if it be not Sunday, and endeth the 28th of November.\r\n\r\nAnd here it is to be noted, that the kings of this realm have used\r\nsometimes to sit in person in the King’s Bench; namely, King Edward IV.,\r\nin the year 1462, in Michaelmas term, sat in the King’s Bench three days\r\ntogether, in the open court, to understand how his laws were ministered\r\nand executed.\r\n\r\nWithin the port, or entry into the hall, on either side are ascendings\r\nup into large chambers, without the hall adjoining thereunto, wherein\r\ncertain courts be kept, namely, on the right hand, is the court of the\r\nExchequer, a place of account for the revenues of the crown: the hearers\r\nof the account have auditors under them; but they which are the chief\r\nfor accounts of the prince, are called barons of the Exchequer, whereof\r\none is called the chief baron. The greatest officer of all is called the\r\nhigh treasurer.[298] In this court be heard those that are delators,\r\nor informers, in popular and penal actions, having thereby part of the\r\nprofit by the law assigned unto them.\r\n\r\nIn this court, if any question be, it is determined after the order of\r\nthe common law of England by twelve men, and all subsidies, taxes, and\r\ncustoms, by account; for in this office the sheriffs of the shire do\r\nattend upon the execution of the commandments of the judges, which the\r\nearl should do, if he were not attending upon the princes in the wars,\r\nor otherwise about him; for the chief office of the earl was to see the\r\nking’s justice to have course, and to be well executed in the shire, and\r\nthe prince’s revenues to be well answered and brought into the treasury.\r\n\r\nIf any fines or amerciaments be extracted out of any of the said courts\r\nupon any man, or any arrerages of accounts of such things as is of\r\ncustoms, taxes, and subsidies, or other such like occasions, the same\r\nthe sheriff of the shire doth gather, and is answerable therefore in\r\nthe Exchequer: as for other ordinary rents of patrimonial lands, and\r\nmost commonly of taxes, customs, and subsidies, there be particular\r\nreceivers and collectors, which do answer it into the Exchequer. This\r\ncourt of the Exchequer hath of old time, and, as I think, since the\r\nConquest, been kept at Westminster, notwithstanding sometimes removed\r\nthence by commandment of the king, and after restored again, as, namely,\r\nin the year 1209, King John commanded the Exchequer to be removed from\r\nWestminster to Northampton, etc.\r\n\r\nOn the left hand above the stair is the Duchy chamber, wherein is kept\r\nthe court for the duchy of Lancaster by a chancellor of that duchy, and\r\nother officers under him. Then is there in another chamber the office of\r\nthe receipts of the queen’s revenues for the crown: then is there also\r\nthe Star chamber, where in the term time, every week once at the least,\r\nwhich is commonly on Fridays and Wednesdays, and on the next day after\r\nthe term endeth, the lord chancellor, and the lords, and other of the\r\nprivy council, and the chief justices of England, from nine of the clock\r\ntill it be eleven, do sit.\r\n\r\nThis place is called the Star chamber, because the roof thereof is\r\ndecked with the likeness of stars gilt: there be plaints heard of riots,\r\nrouts, and other misdemeanors; which if they be found by the king’s\r\ncouncil, the party offender shall be censured by these persons, which\r\nspeak one after another, and he shall be both fined and commanded to\r\nprison.\r\n\r\nThen at the upper end of the great hall, by the King’s Bench, is a going\r\nup to a great chamber, called the White hall, wherein is now kept the\r\ncourt of Wards and Liveries, and adjoining thereunto is the Court of\r\nRequests. Then is St. Stephen’s chapel, of old time founded by King\r\nStephen. King John, in the 7th of his reign, granted to Baldwinus de\r\nLondon, clerk of his Exchequer, the chapelship of St. Stephen’s at\r\nWestminster, etc. This chapel was again since, of a far more curious\r\nworkmanship, new built by King Edward III. in the year 1347, for\r\nthirty-eight persons in that church to serve God; to wit, a dean,\r\ntwelve secular canons, thirteen vicars, four clerks, five choristers,\r\ntwo servitors, to wit, a verger and a keeper of the chapel. He built\r\nfor those from the house of Receipt, along nigh to the Thames, within\r\nthe same palace, there to inhabit; and since that there was also built\r\nfor them, betwixt the clock-house and the wool staple, called the Wey\r\nhouse. He also built to the use of this chapel (though out of the palace\r\ncourt), some distance west, in the little sanctuary, a strong clochard\r\nof stone and timber, covered with lead, and placed therein three great\r\nbells, since usually rung at coronations, triumphs, funeral of princes,\r\nand their obits. Of those bells men fabuled that their ringing soured\r\nall the drink in the town: more, that about the biggest bell was\r\nwritten,--\r\n\r\n    “King Edward made me,\r\n      Thirtie thousand and three;\r\n    Take me downe and wey me,\r\n      And more shall ye find me.”\r\n\r\nBut these bells being taken down indeed, were found all three not\r\nto weigh twenty thousand. True it is, that in the city of Rouen, in\r\nNormandie, there is one great bell, that hath such inscription as\r\nfolloweth:--\r\n\r\n    “Je suis George de Ambois,\r\n    Qui trente cinq mil a pois,\r\n    Mes lui qui me pesera,\r\n    Trente six mil me trouera.\r\n\r\n    “I am George of Ambois,\r\n    Thirty-five thousand in pois;\r\n    But he that shall weigh me,\r\n    Thirty-six thousand shall find me.”\r\n\r\nThe said King Edward endowed this chapel with lands to the yearly value\r\nof five hundred pounds. Doctor John Chambers, the king’s physician,\r\nthe last dean of this college, built thereunto a cloister of curious\r\nworkmanship, to the charges of eleven thousand marks. This chapel, or\r\ncollege, at the suppression, was valued to dispend in lands by the year\r\none thousand and eighty-five pounds ten shillings and five pence, and\r\nwas surrendered to Edward VI.; since the which time the same chapel hath\r\nserved as a parliament house.\r\n\r\nBy this chapel of St. Stephen was sometime one other smaller chapel,\r\ncalled our Lady of the Pew, to the which lady great offerings were\r\nused to be made: amongst other things, I have read, that Richard II.,\r\nafter the overthrow of Wat Tyler and other his rebels, in the 4th of\r\nhis reign, went to Westminster, and there giving thanks to God for his\r\nvictory, made his offering in this chapel; but as divers have noted,\r\nnamely, John Piggot, in the year 1252, on the 17th of February, by\r\nnegligence of a scholar appointed by his schoolmaster to put forth\r\nthe lights of this chapel, the image of our lady, richly decked with\r\njewels, precious stones, pearls, and rings, more than any jeweller could\r\njudge the price for, so saith mine author, was, with all this apparel,\r\nornaments, and chapel itself, burnt; but since again re-edified by\r\nAnthonie, Earl Rivers, Lord Scales, and of the Isle of Wight, uncle and\r\ngovernor to the Prince of Wales, that should have been King Edward V.,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThe said palace, before the entry thereunto, hath a large court, and\r\nin the same a tower of stone, containing a clock, which striketh every\r\nhour on a great bell, to be heard into the hall in sitting time of the\r\ncourts, or otherwise; for the same clock, in a calm, will be heard into\r\nthe city of London. King Henry VI. gave the keeping of this clock,\r\nwith the tower called the clock-house, and the appurtenances, unto\r\nWilliam Walsby, dean of St. Stephen’s, with the wages of six pence the\r\nday out of his Exchequer. By this tower standeth a fountain, which at\r\ncoronations and great triumphs is made to run with wine out of divers\r\nspouts.\r\n\r\nOn the east side of this court is an arched gate to the river of Thames,\r\nwith a fair bridge and landing-place for all men that have occasion. On\r\nthe north side is the south end of St. Stephen’s alley, or Canon row,\r\nand also a way into the old wool staple; and on the west side is a very\r\nfair gate, begun by Richard III. in the year 1484, and was by him built\r\na great height, and many fair lodgings in it, but left unfinished, and\r\nis called the high tower of Westminster. Thus much for the monastery\r\nand palace may suffice. And now will I speak of the gate-house, and of\r\nTotehill street, stretching from the west part of the close.\r\n\r\nThe gate-house is so called of two gates, the one out of the College\r\ncourt towards the north, on the east side whereof was the bishop of\r\nLondon’s prison for clerks’ convict; and the other gate, adjoining to\r\nthe first, but towards the west, is a gaol or prison for offenders\r\nthither committed. Walter Warfield, cellarer to the monastery, caused\r\nboth these gates, with the appurtenances, to be built in the reign of\r\nEdward III.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of this gate, King Henry VII. founded an alms-house\r\nfor thirteen poor men; one of them to be a priest, aged forty-five\r\nyears, a good grammarian, the other twelve to be aged fifty years,\r\nwithout wives: every Saturday the priest to receive of the abbot, or\r\nprior, four pence by the day, and each other two pence halfpenny by the\r\nday for ever, for their sustenance, and every year to each one a gown\r\nand a hood ready made; and to three women that dressed their meat, and\r\nkept them in their sickness, each to have every Saturday sixteen pence,\r\nand every year a gown ready made. More, to the thirteen poor men yearly\r\neighty quarters of coal and one thousand of good faggots to their use,\r\nin the hall and kitchen of their mansion; a discreet monk to be overseer\r\nof them, and he to have forty shillings by the year, etc.; and hereunto\r\nwas every abbot and prior sworn.\r\n\r\nNear unto this house westward was an old chapel of St. Anne; over\r\nagainst the which the Lady Margaret, mother to King Henry VII., erected\r\nan alms-house for poor women, which is now turned into lodgings for the\r\nsinging men of the college. The place wherein this chapel and alms-house\r\nstandeth was called the Elemosinary, or Almonry, now corruptly the\r\nAmbry,[299] for that the alms of the abbey were there distributed to\r\nthe poor. And therein Islip, abbot of Westminster, erected the first\r\npress of book printing that ever was in England, about the year of\r\nChrist 1471. William Caxton, citizen of London, mercer, brought it into\r\nEngland, and was the first that practised it in the said abbey; after\r\nwhich time, the like was practised in the abbeys of St. Augustine at\r\nCanterbury, St. Alban’s, and other monasteries.\r\n\r\nFrom the west gate runneth along Totehil street, wherein is a house\r\nof the Lord Gray of Wilton; and on the other side, at the entry into\r\nTotehill field, Stourton house, which Gyles, the last Lord Dacre of\r\nthe south, purchased and built new, whose lady and wife Anne, sister\r\nto Thomas, the Lord Buckhurst, left money to her executors to build an\r\nhospital for twenty poor women, and so many children, to be brought up\r\nunder them, for whose maintenance she assigned lands to the value of one\r\nhundred pounds by the year, which hospital her executors have new begun\r\nin the field adjoining. From the entry into Totehill field the street is\r\ncalled Petty France, in which, and upon St. Hermit’s hill, on the south\r\nside thereof, Cornelius Van Dun (a Brabander born, yeoman of the guard\r\nto King Henry VIII., King Edward VI., Queen Mary, and Queen Elizabeth,)\r\nbuilt twenty houses for poor women to dwell rent-free: and near hereunto\r\nwas a chapel of Mary Magdalen, now wholly ruinated.\r\n\r\nIn the year of Christ 1256, the 40th of Henry III., John Mansell, the\r\nking’s councillor and priest, did invite to a stately dinner the kings\r\nand queens of England and Scotland, Edward the king’s son, earls,\r\nbarons, and knights, the Bishop of London, and divers citizens, whereby\r\nhis guests did grow to such a number, that his house at Totehill could\r\nnot receive them, but that he was forced to set up tents and pavilions\r\nto receive his guests, whereof there was such a multitude that seven\r\nhundred messes of meat did not serve for the first dinner.\r\n\r\nThe city of Westminster for civil government is divided into twelve\r\nseveral wards; for the which the dean of the collegiate church of\r\nWestminster, or the high-steward, do elect twelve burgesses, and as\r\nmany assistants; that is, one burgess, and one assistant, for every\r\nward; out of the which twelve burgesses two are nominated yearly, upon\r\nThursday in Easter week, for chief burgesses to continue for one year\r\nnext following, who have authority given them by the act of parliament,\r\n27th Elizabeth, to hear, examine, determine, and punish, according to\r\nthe laws of the realm, and lawful customs of the city of London, matters\r\nof incontinency, common scolds, inmates, and common annoyances; and\r\nlikewise, to commit such persons as shall offend against the peace, and\r\nthereof to give knowledge within four-and-twenty hours to some justice\r\nof peace, in the county of Middlesex.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[291] “Which is a goodly house, lately builded nigh to Ivy bridge, over\r\nagainst the old Bedforde house, namely, called Russell house and Dacres\r\nhouse, now the house of Sir Thomas Cecile, Lorde Burghley; and so on the\r\nnorth side to a lane that turneth to the parish church of St. Martin in\r\nthe Fielde, and stretcheth to St. Giles in the Fielde.”--_1st edition_,\r\npp. 370-1.\r\n\r\n[292] “I thinke custome.”--_1st edition_, p. 376.\r\n\r\n[293] “Foundation of Westminster by Sebert, a Christian king, not onely\r\nin word, but in deed.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\n[294] “One of her majesties chaplens.”--_1st edition_, p. 381.\r\n\r\n[295] “Earle of Bridgewater.”--_1st edition_, p. 382.\r\n\r\n[296] In the first edition, the passage relative to Henry II.’s command\r\nto Hugh Gifford and William Browne, to distribute alms “according to\r\nthe weight and measure of the king’s children” (see ante, page 83), is\r\ninserted in this place.\r\n\r\n[297] “I find of record, the 50th of Edward III., that the chapter-house\r\nof the abbot of Westminster was then the usual house for the commons in\r\nparliament.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\n[298] “Of England.”--_1st edition_, p. 387.\r\n\r\n[299] The corruption alluded to by Stow exists to the present day--the\r\nAlmonry being styled by the lower classes in Westminster, the Ambry. The\r\nhouse said to have been Caxton’s is also, we believe, still remaining,\r\nthough in a state of great dilapidation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNORS OF THE CITY OF LONDON; AND FIRST OF ECCLESIASTICAL BISHOPS AND\r\nOTHER MINISTERS THERE\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving thus run through the description of these cities of London\r\nand Westminster, as well in their original foundations, as in their\r\nincreases of buildings and ornaments, together with such incidents of\r\nsundry sorts as are before, both generally and particularly discoursed,\r\nit remaineth that somewhat be noted by me touching the policy and\r\ngovernment, both ecclesiastical and civil, of London, as I have already\r\ndone for Westminster, the order whereof is appointed by the late\r\nstatute, even as that of London is maintained by the customs thereof,\r\nmost laudably used before all the time of memory.\r\n\r\nAnd first, to begin with the ecclesiastical jurisdiction: I read that\r\nthe Christian faith was first preached in this island (then called\r\nBritaine) by Joseph of Arimathea, and his brethren, disciples of Christ,\r\nin the time of Aruiragus, then governor here under the Roman emperor;\r\nafter which time, Lucius, king of the Britaines, sent his ambassadors,\r\nEluanus and Meduvanus, two men learned in the Scriptures, with letters\r\nto Eleutherius,[300] bishop of Rome, desiring him to send some devout\r\nand learned men, by whose instruction he and his people might be taught\r\nthe faith and religion of Christ. Eleutherius baptised those messengers,\r\nmaking Eluanus a bishop, and Meduvius a teacher, and sent over with\r\nthem into Britain two other famous clerks, Faganus and Deruvianus, by\r\nwhose diligence Lucius, and his people of Britaine, were instructed in\r\nthe faith of Christ, and baptized, the temples of idols were converted\r\ninto cathedral churches, and bishops were placed where Flammines\r\nbefore had been; at London, Yorke, and Carleon upon Uske, were placed\r\narchbishops, saith some. The epistle said to be sent by Eleutherius\r\nto king Lucius, for the establishing of the faith, ye may read in my\r\n_Annals_, _Summaries_, and _Chronicles_, truly translated and set down\r\nas mine author hath it, for some have curtailed and corrupted it, and\r\nthen fathered it upon reverend Bede, who never wrote word thereof, or\r\notherwise to that effect, more than this as followeth.\r\n\r\nIn the year 156, Marcus Aurelius Verus, the fourteenth emperor after\r\nAugustus, governed the empire with his brother Aurelius Comodus;\r\nin whose time, Glutherius, a holy man, being pope of the church of\r\nRome, Lucius, king of Britaines, wrote unto him, desiring that by his\r\ncommandment he might be made Christian; which his request was granted\r\nhim; whereby the Britaines receiving then the faith, kept it sound and\r\nundefiled in rest and peace until Dioclesian the emperor’s time. Thus\r\nfar Bede, which may suffice to prove the Christian faith there to be\r\nreceived here. And now of the London bishops as I find them.\r\n\r\nThere remaineth in the parish church of St. Peter upon Cornhill in\r\nLondon a table, wherein is written, that Lucius founded the same church\r\nto be an archbishop’s see, and metropolitan or chief church of his\r\nkingdom, and that it so endured the space of four hundred years, until\r\nthe coming of Augustine the monk, and others, from Rome, in the reign\r\nof the Saxons. The archbishops’ names I find only to be set down by\r\nJoceline of Furnes, in his book of British bishops, and not elsewhere.\r\nThean (saith he) was the first archbishop of London, in the time of\r\nLucius, who built the said church of St. Peter, in a place called\r\nCornhill in London, by the aid of Ciran, chief butler to King Lucius.\r\n\r\n2. Eluanus was the second, and he built a library to the same church\r\nadjoining, and converted many of the Druids (learned men in the Pagan\r\nlaw) to the Christian faith.\r\n\r\n3. Cadar was the third; then followed,\r\n\r\n4. Obinus.\r\n\r\n5. Conan.\r\n\r\n6. Paludius.\r\n\r\n7. Stephen.\r\n\r\n8. Iltute.\r\n\r\n9. Dedwin.\r\n\r\n10. Thedred.\r\n\r\n11. Hillary.\r\n\r\n12. Guidelium.\r\n\r\n13. Vodimus, slain by the Saxons.\r\n\r\n14. Theanus, the fourteenth, fled with the Britaines into Wales, about\r\nthe year of Christ 587.\r\n\r\nThus much out of Joceline of the archbishops; the credit whereof I leave\r\nto the judgment of the learned; for I read of a bishop of London (not\r\nbefore named) in the year of Christ 326, to be present at the second\r\ncouncil, holden at Arles, in the time of Constantine the Great, who\r\nsubscribed thereunto in these words: _Ex provinciæ Britaniæ Civitate\r\nLondiniensi Restitutus Episcopus_, as plainly appeareth in the first\r\ntome of the councils, he writeth not himself archbishop, and therefore\r\nmaketh the matter of archbishops doubtful, or rather, overthroweth that\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nThe Saxons being pagans, having chased the Britons, with the Christian\r\npreachers, into the mountains of Wales and Cornewall; and having divided\r\nthis kingdom of the Britons amongst themselves, at the length, to wit,\r\nin the year 596, Pope Gregory, moved of a godly instinction (sayeth\r\nBede), in the 147th year after the arrival of the Angles or Saxons in\r\nBritaine, sent Augustine, Miletus, Justus, and John, with other monks,\r\nto preach the Gospel to the said nation of the Angles: these landed\r\nin the isle of Thanet, and were first received by Ethelbert, king of\r\nKent, whom they converted to the faith of Christ, with divers other of\r\nhis people, in the 34th year of his reign, which Ethelbert gave unto\r\nAugustine the city of Canterbury.\r\n\r\nThis Augustine, in the year of Christ 604, consecrated Miletus and\r\nJustus bishops, appointing Miletus to preach unto the East Saxons, whose\r\nchief city was London; and there King Sebert, nephew to Ethelbert, by\r\npreaching of Miletus, received the Word of Life: and then Ethelbert king\r\nof Kent, built in the city of London St. Paul’s church, wherein Miletus\r\nbegan to be bishop in the year 619, and sat five years. Ethelbert, by\r\nhis charter, gave lands to this church of St. Paul, so did other kings\r\nafter him. King Sebert, through the good life, and like preaching of\r\nMiletus, having received baptism, to show himself a Christian, built a\r\nchurch to the honour of God and St. Peter, on the west side of London,\r\nwhich church is called Westminster; but the successors of Sebert being\r\npagans, expelled Miletus out of their kingdoms.\r\n\r\nJustus, the second bishop for a time, and then Miletus again; after\r\nwhose decease the seat was void for a time. At length Sigebert, son to\r\nSigebert, brother to Sebert, ruled in Essex; he became a Christian,\r\nand took to him a holy man named Cedde, or Chadde, who won many by\r\npreaching, and good life, to the Christian religion.\r\n\r\nCedde, or Chad, was by Finan consecrated bishop of the East Saxons, and\r\nhe ordered priests and deacons in all the parts of Essex, but especially\r\nat Ithancaster and Tilberie.\r\n\r\nThis city of Ithancaster (saith Raph Cogshall) stood on the bank of the\r\nriver Pante, that runneth by Maldun, in the hundred of Danesey, but now\r\nis drowned in Pante, so that nothing remaineth but the ruin of the city\r\nin the river Tilberie (both the west and east) standeth on the Thames\r\nside, nigh over against Gravesend.\r\n\r\nWina, expelled from the church of Winchester by Cenewalche the king, was\r\nadopted to be the fourth bishop of London, in the reign of Wolferus king\r\nof Mercia, and sat nine years.\r\n\r\nErkenwalde, born in the castle or town of Stallingborough in Lindsey,\r\nfirst abbot of Crotesey, was by Theodore archbishop of Canterbury\r\nappointed to be bishop of the East Saxons, in the city of London. This\r\nErkenwalde, in the year of Christ 677, before he was made bishop, had\r\nbuilt two monasteries, one for himself, being a monk, in the isle of\r\nCrote in Surrey, by the river of Thames, and another for his sister\r\nEdilburge, being a nun, in a certain place called Berching in Essex;\r\nhe deceased at Berching in the year 697, and was then buried in Paul’s\r\nchurch, and translated into the new church of St. Paul in the year 1148.\r\n\r\nWaldhere was bishop of London. Sebba king of the East Saxons at his\r\nhands received the habit of monk, for at that time there were monks\r\nin Paul’s church, as writeth Radulphus de Diceto, and others. To this\r\nbishop he brought a great sum of money, to be bestowed and given to the\r\npoor, reserving nothing to himself, but rather desired to remain poor\r\nin goods as in spirit, for the kingdom of heaven. When he had reigned\r\nthirty years he deceased at Paul’s, and was there buried, and lieth now\r\nin a coffin of stone, on the north side of the aisle next the choir.\r\n\r\nIngwaldus bishop of London was at the consecration of Tatwine archbishop\r\nof Canterbury; he confirmed the foundation of Crowland in the year 716,\r\nsaith Ingulfus, and deceased in the year 744, as saith Hoveden.\r\n\r\n746. Engulfe bishop of London.\r\n\r\n754. Wichet, or Wigerus, bishop of London.\r\n\r\n761. Eaderightus, or Edbrithe, bishop of London.\r\n\r\n768. Eadgain, or Eadgarus, bishop of London.\r\n\r\n773. Kenewallth bishop of London.\r\n\r\n784. Eadbaldus bishop of London.\r\n\r\n795. Heatbright bishop of London, deceased 802, saith Hoveden.\r\n\r\n813. Osmond bishop of London; he was witness to a charter made to\r\nCrowland in the year 833, saith Ingulphus.\r\n\r\n835. Ethelmothe bishop of London.\r\n\r\n838. Elbertus, or Celbertus, bishop of London.\r\n\r\n841. Caulfe bishop of London.\r\n\r\n850. Swithulfus bishop of London; he likewise was witness to a charter\r\nof Crowland 851.\r\n\r\n860.

Hugh de Orwell bishop of London; he died of a\r\nleprosy when he had sitten fifteen years.\r\n\r\n1085. Maurice bishop of London; in whose time, to wit, in the year\r\n1086, the church of St. Paul was burnt, with the most part of this city;\r\nand therefore he laid the foundation of a new large church; and having\r\nsat twenty-two years he deceased 1107, saith Paris.\r\n\r\n1108.

Mary Church, a Norman, bishop of London, who was one\r\nof the three bishops that, by the pope’s commandment, executed his\r\ninterdiction, or curse, upon the whole realm of England; but he was\r\nforced, with the other bishops, to flee the realm in 1208; and his\r\ncastle at Stratford in Essex was by commandment of King John overthrown,\r\n1210. This William, in company of the archbishop of Canterburie, and of\r\nthe bishop of Elie, went to Rome, and there complained against the king,\r\n1212, and returned, so as in the year 1215 King John, in the church of\r\nSt. Paul, at the hands of this William, took upon him the cross for the\r\nHoly Land.

Falcatius de\r\nBrent was delivered to his custody in the year 1224.

In\r\nthe year 1230 (saith Paris), upon the feast day of the Conversion of St.\r\nPaul, when he was at mass in the cathedral church of St. Paul, a great\r\nmultitude of people being there present, suddenly the weather waxed\r\ndark, so as one could scantly see another, and a horrible thunder-clap\r\nlighted on the church, which so shook it, that it was like to have\r\nfallen, and therewithal out of a dark cloud proceeded a flash of\r\nlightning, that all the church seemed to be on fire, whereupon such a\r\nstench ensued, that all men thought they should have died; thousands of\r\nmen and women ran out of the church, and being astonied, fell upon the\r\nground void of all sense and understanding; none of all the multitude\r\ntarried in the church save the bishop and one deacon, which stood still\r\nbefore the high altar, awaiting the will of God. When the air was\r\ncleansed, the multitude returned into the church, and the bishop ended\r\nthe service.\r\n\r\nThis Roger Niger is commended to have been a man of worthy life,\r\nexcellently well-learned, a notable preacher, pleasant in talk, mild\r\nof countenance, and liberal at his table. He admonished the usurers of\r\nhis time to leave such enormities as they tendered the salvation of\r\ntheir souls, and to do penance for that they had committed. But when\r\nhe saw they laughed him to scorn, and also threatened him, the bishop\r\ngenerally excommunicated and accursed all such, and commanded straitly\r\nthat such usurers should depart farther from the city of London, which\r\nhither towards had been ignorant of such mischief and wickedness, least\r\nhis diocese should be infected therewithal. He fell sick and died at his\r\nmanor of Bishops hall, in the lordship and parish of Stebunheth, in the\r\nyear 1241, and was buried in Paul’s church, on the north side of the\r\npresbytery, in a fair tomb, coped, of grey marble.\r\n\r\n1241.

Fulco Lovel, archdeacon of Colchester, elected bishop of London,\r\nbut refused that place.\r\n\r\n1280. Richard Gravesend, archdeacon of Northampton, bishop of London.\r\nIt appeareth by the charter-warren granted to this bishop, that in his\r\ntime there were two woods in the parish of Stebunhith pertaining to the\r\nsaid bishop. I have since I kept house for myself known the one of them\r\nby Bishops hall; but now they are both made plain of wood, and not to\r\nbe discerned from other grounds. Some have fabuled that this Richard\r\nGravesend, bishop of London, in the year 1392, the 16th of Richard II.,\r\npurchased the charter of liberties to this city; which thing hath no\r\npossibility of truth, as I have proved, for he deceased in the year\r\n1303, almost ninety years before that time.\r\n\r\n1307.

FOLLOWETH:\r\n\r\n\r\nHospital of St. Mary, in the parish of Barking church, that was provided\r\nfor poor priests and others, men and women in the city of London, that\r\nwere fallen into frenzy or loss of their memory, until such time as they\r\nshould recover, was since suppressed and given to the hospital of St.\r\nKatherine, by the Tower.\r\n\r\nSt. Anthonies, an hospital of thirteen poor men, and college, with a\r\nfree school for poor men’s children, founded by citizens of London,\r\nlately by John Tate, first a brewer and then a mercer, in the ward of\r\nBroad street, suppressed in

new founded,\r\nendowed, and furnished by Queen Mary, and so remaineth.\r\n\r\nSt. Katherine, by the Tower of London, an hospital, with a master,\r\nbrethren, and sisters, and alms women, founded by Matilde, wife to King\r\nStephen; not suppressed, but in force as before.\r\n\r\nSt. Mary within Cripplegate, an hospital founded by William Elsing, for\r\na hundred blind people of the city, was suppressed by King Henry VIII.\r\n\r\nSt. Mary Bethelem, without Bishopsgate, was an hospital, founded\r\nby Simon Fitzmary, a citizen of London, to have been a priory, and\r\nremaineth for lunatic people, being suppressed and given to Christ’s\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\nSt. Mary, without Bishopsgate, was an hospital and priory, called St.\r\nMary Spittle, founded by a citizen of London for relief of the poor,\r\nwith provision of one hundred and eighty beds there for the poor: it was\r\nsuppressed in the reign of King Henry VIII.\r\n\r\nSt. Mary Rouncevall, by Charing cross, was an hospital

great receipt for the\r\npoor, was suppressed, but again newly founded and endowed by the\r\nbenevolence and charity of the citizens of London.\r\n\r\nAn hospital there was without Aldersgate, a cell to the house of Cluny,\r\nof the French order, suppressed by King Henry V.\r\n\r\nAn hospital without Cripplegate, also a like cell to the said house of\r\nCluny, suppressed by King Henry V.\r\n\r\nA third hospital in Oldborne, being also a cell to the said house of\r\nCluny, suppressed by King Henry V.\r\n\r\nThe hospital, or alms-house, called God’s house, for thirteen poor\r\nmen, with a college, called Whitington college, founded by Richard\r\nWhitington, mercer, and suppressed; but the poor remain, and are paid\r\ntheir allowance by the mercers.\r\n\r\nChrist’s hospital, in Newgate market, of a new foundation in the Grey\r\nFryers church by King Henry VIII.: poor fatherless children be there\r\nbrought up and nourished at the charges of the citizens.\r\n\r\nBridewell, now an hospital (or house of correction), founded by King\r\nEdward VI., to be a workhouse for the poor and idle persons of the\r\ncity, wherein a great number of vagrant persons be now set a-work,\r\nand relieved at the charges of the citizens. Of all these hospitals,\r\nbeing twenty in number, you may read before in their several places,\r\nas also of good and charitable provisions made for the poor by sundry\r\nwell-disposed citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW OF LEPROSE PEOPLE, AND LAZAR HOUSES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed that leprous persons were always, for avoiding the\r\ndanger of infection, to be separated from the sound, etc.; God himself\r\ncommanding to put out of the host every leper.[302] Whereupon I read,\r\nthat in a provincial synod holden at Westminster by Hubert, archbishop\r\nof Canterbury, in the year of Christ 1200, the 2nd of King John, it\r\nwas decreed, according to the institution of the Lateran council, that\r\nwhen so many leprous people were assembled, that might be able to build\r\na church, with a churchyard, for themselves, and to have one especial\r\npriest of their own, that they should be permitted to have the same\r\nwithout contradiction, so they be not injurious to the old churches,\r\nby that which was granted to them for pity’s sake. And further, it was\r\ndecreed that they be not compelled to give any tithes of their gardens\r\nor increase of cattle.\r\n\r\nI have moreover heard, that there is a writ in our law, _de leproso\r\namovendo_; and I have read that King Edward III., in the 20th year of\r\nhis reign, gave commandment to the mayor and sheriffs of London, to make\r\nproclamation in every ward of the city and suburbs, that all leprous\r\npersons inhabiting there should avoid within fifteen days next, and\r\nthat no man suffer any such leprous person to abide within his house,\r\nupon pain to forfeit his said house, and to incur the king’s further\r\ndispleasure; and that they should cause the said lepers to be removed\r\ninto some out places of the fields, from the haunt or company of sound\r\npeople: whereupon certain lazar-houses, as may be supposed, were then\r\nbuilt without the city some good distance; to wit, the Locke without\r\nSouthwark in Kent street; one other betwixt the Miles end and Stratford,\r\nBow; one other at Kingsland, betwixt Shoreditch and Stoke Newington; and\r\nanother at Knightes bridge, west from Charing cross. These four I have\r\nnoted to be erected for the receipt of leprous people sent out of the\r\ncity. At that time, also, the citizens required of the guardian of St.\r\nGiles’ hospital to take from them, and to keep continually, the number\r\nof fourteen persons leprous, according to the foundation of Matilde the\r\nqueen, which was for leprous persons of the city of London and the shire\r\nof Middlesex, which was granted. More, the wardens, or keepers of the\r\nports, gates, or posterns of this city, were sworn in the mayor’s court\r\nbefore the recorder, etc., that they should well and faithfully keep the\r\nsame ports and posterns, and not to suffer any leprous person to enter\r\nthe said city.\r\n\r\nJohn Gardener, porter of the postern by the Tower, his oath before\r\nthe mayor and recorder of London, on Monday, after the feast of St.\r\nBartlemew, the 49th of Edward III.: That the gates and postern be well\r\nand faithfully kept in his office and baylywicke, and that he should\r\nnot suffer any lepers or leper to enter the city, or to remain in the\r\nsuburbs; and if any leper or lepers force themselves to enter by his\r\ngates or postern, he to bind them fast to horses, and send them to be\r\nexamined of the superiors, etc.\r\n\r\nFinally, I read that one William Pole, yeoman of the crown to King\r\nEdward IV., being stricken with a leprosy, was also desirous to build\r\nan hospital, with a chapel, to the honour of God and St. Anthony, for\r\nthe relief and harbouring of such leprous persons as were destitute in\r\nthe kingdom, to the end they should not be offensive to other in their\r\npassing to and fro: for the which cause Edward IV. did by his charter,\r\ndated the 12th of his reign, give unto the said William for ever a\r\ncertain parcel of his land lying in his highway of Highgate and Haloway,\r\nwithin the county of Middlesex, containing sixty feet in length and\r\nthirty-four in breadth.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[302] “Leviticus 13. Numbers 5. Leprose persons to be separated from the\r\nsound.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TEMPORAL GOVERNMENT OF THIS CITY, SOMEWHAT IN BRIEF MANNER\r\n\r\n\r\nThis city of London, being under the government of the Britons, Romans,\r\nand Saxons, the most ancient and famous city of the whole realm, was at\r\nlength destroyed by the Danes, and left desolate, as may appear by our\r\nhistories. But Aelfred, king of the West Saxons, having brought this\r\nwhole realm (from many parts) into one monarchy, honourably repaired\r\nthis city, and made it again habitable, and then committed the custody\r\nthereof to his son-in-law Adhered, earl of Mercia; after whose decease\r\nthe city, with all other possessions pertaining to the said earl,\r\nreturned to King Edward, surnamed the Elder, etc.: and so remained in\r\nthe king’s hands, being governed under him by portgraves (or portreves),\r\nwhich name is compounded of the two Saxon words, _porte_ and _gerefe_,\r\nor _reve_. Porte betokeneth a town, and gerefe signifieth a guardian,\r\nruler, or keeper of the town.\r\n\r\nThese governors of old time (saith Robert Fabian), with the laws and\r\ncustoms then used within this city, were registered in a book called the\r\nDooms’ day, written in the Saxon tongue; but of later days, when the\r\nsaid laws and customs were changed, and for that also the said book was\r\nof a small hand, sore defaced, and hard to be read or understood, it was\r\nless set by, so that it was embezzled and lost. Thus far Fabian.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, I have found, by search of divers old registers and\r\nother records abroad, namely, in a book sometime appertaining to the\r\nmonastery of St. Alban’s, of the portgraves, and other governors of this\r\ncity, as followeth:\r\n\r\nFirst, that in the reign of King Edward, the last before the Conquest,\r\nWolfegare was portgrave, as may appear by the charter of the same king,\r\nin these words: “Edward, king, greeteth Alfward, bishop, and Wolfegare,\r\nmy portgrave, and all the burgesses in London.” And afterward that, in\r\nanother charter, “King Edward greeteth William, bishop, and Sweetman, my\r\nportgrave.” And after, that in another charter to the abbey of Chertsey,\r\nto William, bishop, and Leofstane and Alsy, portgraves. In the reign of\r\nWilliam the Conqueror, William, bishop of London, procured of the said\r\nConqueror his charter of liberties, to the same William, bishop, and\r\nGodfrey, portgrave, in Saxon tongue, and corrected in English thus:\r\n\r\n“William, king, greet William, bishop, and Godfrey, portgrave, and all\r\nthe burgeses within London, French and English. And I graunt that they\r\nbe all their law worthy that they were in Edward’s dayes the king. And I\r\nwill that each child bee his father’s heire. And I will not suffer that\r\nany man do you wrong, and God you keepe.” And then in the reign of the\r\nsaid Conqueror and of William Rufus, Godfrey de Magnavile was portgrave\r\n(or sheriff), as may appear by their charters, and Richard de Par was\r\nprovost.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of King Henry I., Hugh Buche was portgrave, and Leofstanus,\r\ngoldsmith, provost, buried at Bermondsey.\r\n\r\nAfter them Aubrey de Vere was portgrave, and Robert Bar Querel provost.\r\nThis Aubrey de Vere was slain in the reign of King Stephen. It is to be\r\nnoted, also, that King Henry I. granted to the citizens of London the\r\nshrivewick thereof, and of Middlesex, as in another place is showed.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of King Stephen, Gilbert Becket was portgrave, and Andrew\r\nBuchevet provost.\r\n\r\nAfter him, Godfrey Magnavile, the son of William, the son of Godfrey\r\nMagnavile, by the gift of Maude, the empress, was portgrave, or sheriff\r\nof London and Middlesex, for the yearly farm of three hundred pounds, as\r\nappeareth by the charter.\r\n\r\nIn the time of King Henry II., Peter Fitzwalter was portgrave; after\r\nhim John Fitznigel was portgrave; after him Ernulfus Buchel became\r\nportgrave; and after him William Fitz Isabel. These portgraves are also\r\nin divers records called vice-counties, vicounties, or sheriffs,[303]\r\nas being under an earl; for that they then, as since, used that office\r\nas the sheriffs of London do till this day. Some authors do call them\r\ndomesmen, aldermen, or judges of the king’s court,\r\n\r\nWilliam Fitz Stephen, noting the estate of this city, and government\r\nthereof in his time, under the reign of King Stephen and of Henry II.,\r\nhath these words:\r\n\r\n“This city (saith he), even as Rome, is divided into wards; it hath\r\nyearly sheriffs instead of consuls; it hath the dignity of senators and\r\naldermen; it hath under officers, and, according to the quality of laws,\r\nit hath several courts and general assemblies upon appointed days.” Thus\r\nmuch for the antiquity of sheriffs, and also of aldermen, in several\r\nwards of this city, may suffice. And now for the name of bailiffs, and\r\nafter that of mayors, as followeth:\r\n\r\nIn the first year of King Richard I., the citizens of London obtained\r\nto be governed by two bailiffs, which bailiffs are in divers ancient\r\ndeeds called sheriffs, according to the speech of the law, which called\r\nthe shire Balliva, for that they, like as the portgraves, used the same\r\noffice of shrivewicke, for the which the city paid to fee farm three\r\nhundred pounds yearly as before, since the reign of Henry I., which also\r\nis yet paid by the city into the Exchequer until this day.\r\n\r\nThey also obtained to have a mayor, to be their principal governor and\r\nlieutenant of the city, as of the king’s chamber.\r\n\r\n1180. The names of the first bailiffs, or officers, entering into\r\ntheir office at the feast of St. Michael the Archangel, in the year of\r\nChrist 1189, were named Henry Cornhill and Richard Reynere, bailiffs or\r\nsheriffs.\r\n\r\nTheir first mayor was Henry Fitz Alwin Fitz Liefstane, goldsmith,\r\nappointed by the said king, and continued mayor from the 1st of Richard\r\nI. until the 15th of King John, which was twenty-four years and more.\r\n\r\n1190.

Domesmen, or judges of the King’s court.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\n[304] The first edition has “mayor Hugh Fitz Thomas,” and does not make\r\nmention of “Fitz Ottonis.”\r\n\r\n[305] Hallontide,--or, as it was more generally designated, All\r\nHallontide,--is the older designation of All Saints’ day, the 1st of\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALDERMEN AND SHERIFFS OF LONDON\r\n\r\n\r\nThere be in this city, according to the number of wards, twenty-six\r\naldermen; whereof yearly, on the feast day of St. Michael the Archangel,\r\none of them is elected to be mayor for the year following, to begin\r\non the 28th of October: the other aldermen, his brethren, are to him\r\nassistants in councils, courts, etc.\r\n\r\nMore, there is a recorder of London, a grave and learned lawyer, skilful\r\nin the customs of this city, also assistant to the lord mayor: he taketh\r\nplace in councils and in courts before any man that hath not been mayor,\r\nand learnedly delivereth the sentences of the whole court.\r\n\r\nThe sheriffs of London, of old time chosen out of the commonalty,\r\ncommoners, and oftentimes never came to be aldermen, as many aldermen\r\nwere never sheriffs, and yet advanced to be mayor, but of late (by\r\noccasion) the sheriffs have been made aldermen before or presently after\r\ntheir election.\r\n\r\nNicholas Faringdon was never sheriff, yet four times mayor of this city,\r\nand so of other, which reproveth a bye word, such a one will be mayor,\r\nor he be sheriff, etc.\r\n\r\nThen is there a chamberlain of London. A common clerk, or town clerk. A\r\ncommon sergeant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFICERS BELONGING TO THE LORD MAYOR’S HOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\n    Sword-bearer,  }\r\n    Common hunt,   } esquires, four.\r\n    Common crier,  }\r\n    Water bailiff. }\r\n    Coroner of London.\r\n    Sergeant carvers, three.\r\n    Sergeants of the chamber, three.\r\n    Sergeant of the channel.\r\n    Yeoman of the channel.\r\n    Yeomen of the water side, four.\r\n    Under water-bailiff.\r\n    Yeomen of the chamber, two.\r\n    Meal weighers, three.\r\n    Yeomen of the wood wharfs, two.\r\n    The sword-bearer’s man.   }\r\n    Common hunt’s men, two.   }\r\n    Common crier’s man.       } gentlemen’s men, seven.\r\n    Water-bailiffs’ men, two. }\r\n    The carver’s man.         }\r\n\r\nWhereof nine of these have liveries of the lord mayor, viz., the\r\nsword-bearer, and his man, the three carvers, and the four yeomen of the\r\nwater side; all the rest have their liveries from the chamber of London.\r\n\r\nThus far after my notes delivered by an officer of the lord mayor’s\r\nhouse, but unperfected; for I remember a crowner, an under-chamberlain,\r\nand four clerks of the mayor’s court, and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHERIFFS OF LONDON; THEIR OFFICERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sheriffs of London, in the year 1471, were appointed each of them\r\nto have sixteen sergeants, every sergeant to have his yeoman, and six\r\nclerks; to wit, a secondary, a clerk of the papers, and four other\r\nclerks, besides the under sheriffs’ clerks, their stewards, butlers,\r\nporters, and other in household many.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE MAYOR’S AND SHERIFFS’ LIVERIES SOMEWHAT\r\n\r\n\r\nTo follow precedent of former time, the clerks of companies were to\r\ninquire for them of their companies that would have the mayor’s livery,\r\ntheir money as a benevolence given, which must be twenty shillings at\r\nthe least put in a purse, with their names that gave it, and the wardens\r\nto deliver it to the mayor by the first of December; for the which\r\nevery man had then sent him four yards of broad cloth, rowed or striped\r\nathwart, with a different colour to make him a gown, and these were\r\ncalled ray gowns, which was then the livery of the mayor, and also of\r\nthe sheriffs, but each differing from others in the colours.\r\n\r\nOf older times I read, that the officers of this city wore gowns of\r\nparty colours, as the right side of one colour and the left side of\r\nanother; as, for example, I read in books of accounts in the Guildhall,\r\nthat in the 19th year of Henry VI. there was bought for an officer’s\r\ngown two yards of cloth, coloured mustard villars (a colour now out of\r\nuse), and two yards of cloth, coloured blue, price two shillings the\r\nyard, in all eight shillings. More, paid to John Pope, draper, for two\r\ngown cloths, eight yards of two colours, _eux ombo deux de rouge_ (or\r\nred), _medle bune_, and _porre_ (or purple) colour, price the yard two\r\nshillings. These gowns were for Piers Rider and John Bukles, clerks of\r\nthe chamber.\r\n\r\nMore, I read that in the year 1516, in the 7th of Henry VIII., it\r\nwas agreed by a common council in the Guildhall that the sheriffs of\r\nLondon should (as they had been accustomed) give yearly rayed gowns\r\nto the recorder, chamberlain, common sergeant, and common clerk, the\r\nsword-bearer, common hunt, water-bailiff, common crier, like as to their\r\nown offices, etc.\r\n\r\n1525. More, in the 16th of Henry VIII., Sir William Bayly, then being\r\nmayor, made a request, for that clothes of ray (as he alleged) were evil\r\nwrought, his officers might be permitted (contrary to custom) for that\r\nyear to wear gowns of one colour; to the which, in a common council,\r\none answered and said, “Yea, it might be permitted,” and no man said,\r\n“Nay,” and so it passed. Thus much for party coloured and ray gowns have\r\nI read: but for benevolence to the mayor, I find that of later time that\r\neach man giving forty shillings towards his charges, received four yards\r\nof broad cloth to make him a gown, for Thomas White performed it in\r\nthe 1st of Queen Mary; but Sir Thomas Lodge gave instead of four yards\r\nof broad cloth, three yards of satin to make them doublets, and since\r\nthat the three yards of satin is turned into a silver spoon, and so it\r\nholdeth.\r\n\r\nThe days of attendance that the fellowships do give to the mayor at his\r\ngoing to Paules were seven, as followeth:--\r\n\r\n    1. Alhallowen day.\r\n    2. Christmasse day.\r\n    3. St. Stephen’s day.\r\n    4. St. John’s day.\r\n    5. New Year’s day.\r\n    6. Twelfth day.\r\n    7. Candlemasse day.\r\n\r\nThe 23rd of Henry VIII., these companies had place at the mayor’s feast\r\nin the Guildhall, in order as followeth; I speak by precedent, for I was\r\nnever feast-follower:--\r\n\r\n    1.

For the first of these\r\ncompanies that I read of to be a guild, brotherhood, or fraternity,\r\nin this city, were the weavers, whose guild was confirmed by Henry\r\nII. The next fraternity, which was of St. John Baptist, time out of\r\nmind, called of tailors and linen-armourers of London; I find that King\r\nEdward I., in the 28th of his reign, confirmed that guild by the name of\r\ntailors and linen-armourers, and gave to the brethren there of authority\r\nyearly to choose unto them a governor, or master, with wardens, etc. The\r\nother companies have since purchased license of societies, brotherhoods,\r\nor corporations, in the reigns of Edward III., Richard II., Henry IV.,\r\nHenry V., Henry VI., and Edward IV., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMEWHAT OF LIVERIES WORN BY CITIZENS OF LONDON, IN TIME OF TRIUMPHS AND\r\nOTHERWAYS\r\n\r\n\r\n1236. The 20th of Henry III., the mayor, aldermen, sheriffs, and\r\ncitizens of London, rode out to meet the king and his new wife, Queen\r\nElianor, daughter to Reymond Beringarius of Aragon, earl of Provence and\r\nNarbone. The citizens were clothed in long garments, embroidered about\r\nwith gold, and silk in divers colours, their horses finely trapped, to\r\nthe number of three hundred and sixty, every man bearing a golden or\r\nsilver cup in his hand, the king’s trumpets before them sounding, etc.,\r\nas ye may read in my _Annales_.\r\n\r\n1300. The 29th of Edward I., the said king took to wife Margaret, sister\r\nto Philip Le Beau, king of France; they were married at Canterbury. The\r\nqueen was conveyed to London, against whom the citizens to the number of\r\nsix hundred rode in one livery of red and white, with the cognizances of\r\ntheir mysteries embroidered upon their sleeves, they received her four\r\nmiles out of London, and so conveyed her to Westminster.\r\n\r\n1415. The 3rd of Henry V., the said king arriving at Dover, the mayor of\r\nLondon with the aldermen and crafts-men riding in red, with hoods red\r\nand white, met with the king on the Blacke hith, coming from Eltham with\r\nhis prisoners out of France.\r\n\r\n1432. The 10th of Henry VI., he being crowned in France, returning\r\ninto England, came to Eltham towards London, and the mayor of London,\r\nJohn Welles, the aldermen, with the commonalty, rode against him on\r\nhorseback, the mayor in crimson velvet, a great velvet hat furred,\r\na girdle of gold about his middle, and a bawdrike of gold about his\r\nneck trilling down behind him, his three henxemen, on three great\r\ncoursers following him, in one suit of red, all spangled in silver,\r\nthen the aldermen in gowns of scarlet, with sanguine hoods, and all the\r\ncommonality of the city clothed in white gowns, and scarlet hoods, with\r\ndivers cognizances embroidered on their sleeves, etc.\r\n\r\n1485. The 1st of Henry VII., the mayor, aldermen, sheriffs, and\r\ncommonality, all clothed in violet (as in a mourning colour), met the\r\nking at Shorditch, and conveyed him to Powles church, where he offered\r\nhis banners.\r\n\r\nThus much for liveries of citizens in ancient times, both in triumphs\r\nand otherwise, may suffice, whereby may be observed, that the coverture\r\nof men’s heads was then hoods, for neither cap nor hat is spoken of,\r\nexcept that John Welles mayor of London to wear a hat in time of\r\ntriumph, but differing from the hats lately taken in use, and now\r\ncommonly worn for noblemen’s liveries. I read that Thomas earl of\r\nLancaster in the reign of Edward II. gave at Christmas in liveries, to\r\nsuch as served him, a hundred and fifty-nine broad cloaths, allowing to\r\nevery garment furs to fur their hoods: more near our time, there yet\r\nremaineth the counterfeits and pictures of aldermen, and others that\r\nlived in the reigns of Henry VI. and Edward IV., namely alderman Darby\r\ndwelling in Fenchurch street, over against the parish church of St.\r\nDiones, left his picture, as of an alderman, in a gown of scarlet on\r\nhis back, a hood on his head, etc., as is in that house (and elsewhere)\r\nto be seen: for a further monument of those late times, men may behold\r\nthe glass windows of the mayor’s court in the Guildhall above the\r\nstairs, the mayor is there pictured sitting in habit, party-coloured,\r\nand a hood on his head, his swordbearer before him with a hat or cap\r\nof maintenance: the common clerk, and other officers bare-headed,\r\ntheir hoods on their shoulders; and therefore I take it, that the use\r\nof square bonnets worn by noblemen, gentlemen, citizens, and others,\r\ntook beginning in this realm by Henry VII. and in his time, and of\r\nfurther antiquity, I can see no counterfeit or other proof of use.\r\nHenry VIII. (towards his latter reign) wore a round flat cap of scarlet\r\nor of velvet, with a bruch or jewel, and a feather; divers gentlemen,\r\ncourtiers, and others, did the like. The youthful citizens also took\r\nthem to the new fashion of flat caps, knit of woollen yarn black, but so\r\nlight, that they were obliged to tie them under their chins, for else\r\nthe wind would be master over them. The use of these flat round caps so\r\nfar increased (being of less price than the French bonnet) that in short\r\ntime young aldermen took the wearing of them; Sir John White wore it in\r\nhis mayoralty, and was the first that left example to his followers;\r\nbut now the Spanish felt, or the like counterfeit, is most commonly of\r\nall men both spiritual and temporal taken to use, so that the French\r\nbonnet or square cap, and also the round or flat cap, have for the most\r\npart given place to the Spanish felt; but yet in London amongst the\r\ngraver sort (I mean the liveries of companies), remaineth a memory of\r\nthe hoods of old time worn by their predecessors: these hoods were worn,\r\nthe roundlets upon their heads, the skirts to hang behind in their necks\r\nto keep them warm, the tippet to lie on their shoulder, or to wind about\r\ntheir necks, these hoods were of old time made in colours according to\r\ntheir gowns, which were of two colours, as red and blue, or red and\r\npurple, murrey, or as it pleased their masters and wardens to appoint\r\nto the companies; but now of late time, they have used their gowns to\r\nbe all of one colour, and those of the saddest, but their hoods being\r\nmade the one half of the same cloth their gowns be of, the other half\r\nremaineth red as of old time. And so I end, as wanting time to travel\r\nfurther in this work.\r\n\r\nNow since that I have given you an outward view of this city, it shall\r\nnot be impertinent to let you take an insight also of the same, such\r\nas a Londoner born discoursed about twenty years gone, for answer (as\r\nit seemeth) to some objections that then were made against the growing\r\ngreatness thereof. The author gave it me, and therefore, howsoever I\r\nconceal his name (which itself pretendeth not), I think I may without\r\nhis offence impart it to others, that they may take pleasure in the\r\nreading, as I doubt not but he did in the writing. Long may they (that\r\nlist) envy, and long may we and our posterity enjoy the good estate of\r\nthis city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA DISCOURSE OF THE NAMES AND FIRST CAUSES OF THE INSTITUTION OF CITIES\r\nAND PEOPLED TOWNS AND OF THE COMMODITIES THAT DO GROW BY THE SAME; AND,\r\nNAMELY, OF THE CITY OF LONDON\r\n\r\n    WRITTEN BY WAY OF AN APOLOGY (OR DEFENCE) AGAINST THE OPINION OF\r\n    SOME MEN, WHICH THINK THAT THE GREATNESS OF THAT CITY STANDETH NOT\r\n    WITH THE PROFIT AND SECURITY OF THIS REALM\r\n\r\n\r\nCities and well-peopled places be called _Oppida_, in Latin; either _ab\r\nope danda_, or _ab opibus_, or _ab opponendo se hostibus_. They be named\r\nalso _Civitates a cöeundo_, and _urbes_, either of the word _urbare_,\r\nbecause the first inclosure of them was described with the draught of a\r\nplough, or else _ab orbe_, for the round compass that they at the first\r\nhad.\r\n\r\nIn the Greek a city is termed πόλις, either of the word πολὺς, _multus_,\r\nor of πολεῖνω πολένεον,[306] _id est_, _habitare_, _alere_, _gubernare_.\r\n\r\nIn the Saxon (or old English) sometimes _Tun_, which we now call town,\r\nderived of the word _Tynan_, to inclose or tyne, as some yet speak.\r\nBut forasmuch as that word was proper to every village and inclosed\r\ndwelling, therefore our ancestors called their walled towns _Burh_ or\r\n_Byrg_, and we now Bury and Borough, of the Greek word πύργος (as I\r\nthink), which signifieth a tower or a high building.\r\n\r\nThe walls of these towns had their name of _vallum_, because at the\r\nfirst they were but of that earth which was cast out of the trench,\r\nor ditch, wherewith they were environed. But afterward, being made of\r\nmatter more fit for defence, they were named _a muniendo mœnia_. By\r\nthe etymology of these names, it may appear that common weals, cities,\r\nand towns, were at the first invented, to the end that men might lead\r\na civil life amongst themselves, and be saved harmless against their\r\nenemies; whereupon Plato saith, “_Civitates ab initio utilitatis causa\r\nconstitutæ sunt_.” Aristotle, 1. Politicorum, 2. saith, “_Civitas a\r\nnatura profecta est: homo enim animal aptum est ad cœtus, et proinde\r\ncivitatis origo ad viuendum, institutio ad bene viuendum refertur._”\r\nAnd Cicero, _lib. primo de Inventione_, in the beginning, saith, “_Fuit\r\nquoddam tempus cum in agris homines passim bestiarum more vagabantur,\r\netc. quo quidem tempore, quidam (magnus, viz. vir et sapiens) dispersos\r\nhomines in agris, et tectis silvestribus abditos, ratione quadam\r\ncompulit in unum locum, atque eos in unamquamq; rem induxit utilem et\r\nhonestam. Urbibus vero constitutis fidem colere, et justitiam retinere\r\ndiscebant, et aliis parere sua voluntate consuescebant_,” etc. The same\r\nman discourseth notably to the same effect in his Oration _Pro Sestio_,\r\na little after the midst thereof, showing that in the life of men\r\ndispersed, _vis_, beareth all the sway; but in the civil life, _ars_ is\r\nbetter maintained, etc. This thing well saw King William the Conqueror,\r\nwho in his laws, fol. 125, saith, “_Burgi et civitates fundata, et\r\nedificata sunt, ad tuitionem gentium et populorum Regni, et idcirco\r\nobservari debent cum omni libertate, integritate et ratione_.” And his\r\npredecessors, King Ethelstane and King Canutus, in their laws, fol. 62\r\nand 106, had commanded thus: “_Oppida instaurantur_,” etc.\r\n\r\nSeeing, therefore, that as Cicero, 2. _Officior._ saith, “_Proxime et\r\nsecundum Deos, homines hominibus maxime utiles esse possunt_;” and\r\nthat men are congregated into cities and commonwealths for honesty\r\nand utility’s sake, these shortly be the commodities that do come by\r\ncities, commonalties, and corporations. First, men by this nearness\r\nof conversation are withdrawn from barbarous feritie and force to a\r\ncertain mildness of manners, and to humanity and justice; whereby they\r\nare contented to give and take right, to and from their equals and\r\ninferiors, and to hear and obey their heads and superiors. Also the\r\ndoctrine of God is more fitly delivered, and the discipline thereof\r\nmore aptly to be executed, in peopled towns than abroad, by reason of\r\nthe facility of common and often assembling; and consequently such\r\ninhabitants be better managed in order, and better instructed in\r\nwisdom: whereof it came to pass, that at the first, they that excelled\r\nothers this way, were called _astuti_, of the Greek word ἄστυ, which\r\nsignifieth a city, although the term be now declined to the worst\r\npart, and do betoken evil, even as _tyrannus_, _sophista_, and some\r\nsuch other originally good words are fallen; and hereof also good\r\nbehaviour is yet called _urbanitas_, because it is rather found in\r\ncities than elsewhere. In some, by often hearing men be better persuaded\r\nin religion, and for that they live in the eyes of others, they be\r\nby example the more easily trained to justice, and by shamefastness\r\nrestrained from injury.\r\n\r\nAnd whereas commonwealths and kingdoms cannot have, next after God, any\r\nsurer foundation than the love and goodwill of one man towards another,\r\nthat also is closely bred and maintained in cities, where men by mutual\r\nsociety and companying together, do grow to alliances, commonalties, and\r\ncorporations.\r\n\r\nThe liberal sciences and learnings of all sorts, which be _lumina\r\nreipublicæ_, do flourish only in peopled towns; without the which a\r\nrealm is in no better case than a man that lacketh both his eyes.\r\n\r\nManual arts, or handicrafts, as they have for the most part been\r\ninvented in towns and cities, so they cannot anywhere else be either\r\nmaintained or amended. The like is to be said of merchandise, under\r\nwhich name I comprehend all manner of buying, selling, bartering,\r\nexchanging, communicating of things that men need to and fro. Wealth and\r\nriches, which are truly called _subsidia belli, et ornamenta pacis_, are\r\nincreased chiefly in towns and cities both to the prince and people.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of the poor and needy is in such places both sooner to be\r\nespied, and hath means to be more charitably relieved.\r\n\r\nThe places themselves be surer refuges in all extremities of foreign\r\ninvasion, and the inhabitants be a ready hand and strength of men, with\r\nmunition to oppress intestine sedition.\r\n\r\nMoreover, forasmuch as the force of the wars of our time consisteth\r\nchiefly in shot, all other soldiers being either horsemen or footmen,\r\narmed on land, or mariners at the sea, it seemeth to me that citizens\r\nand townsmen be as fit to be employed in any of these services, that on\r\nhorseback only excepted, as the inhabitants that be drawn out of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, even as these societies and assemblies of men in cities\r\nand great towns are a continual bridle against tyranny, which was the\r\ncause that Tarquin, Nero, Dionysius, and such others, have always sought\r\nto weaken them: so, being well tempered, they are a strong fort and\r\nbulwark, not only in the aristocracy, but also in the lawful kingdom or\r\njust royalty.\r\n\r\nAt once the propagation of religion, the execution of good policy, the\r\nexercise of charity, and the defence of the country, is best performed\r\nby towns and cities; and this civil life approacheth nearest to the\r\nshape of that mystical body whereof Christ is the head, and men be the\r\nmembers; whereupon both at the first, that man of God Moses, in the\r\ncommonwealth of the Israelites, and the governors of all countries, in\r\nall ages since, have continually maintained the same; and to change it\r\nwere nothing else but to metamorphose the world, and to make wild beasts\r\nof reasonable men. To stand longer upon this it were, _in re non dubia,\r\nuti oratione non necessaria_; and therefore I will come to London.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[306] Sic in Stow; Strype corrects it into πολεύω.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SINGULARITIES OF THE CITY OF LONDON\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatsoever is said of cities generally, maketh also for London\r\nspecially; howbeit, these things are particularly for our purpose to be\r\nconsidered in it. The situation; the former estimation that it hath had;\r\nthe service that it hath done; the present estate and government of it,\r\nand such benefits as do grow to the realm by the maintenance thereof.\r\n\r\nThis realm hath only three principal rivers, whereon a royal city may\r\nwell be situated: Trent, in the north, Severn in the south-west, and\r\nThames in the south-east; of the which Thames, both for the straight\r\ncourse in length reacheth furthest into the belly of the land, and for\r\nthe breadth and stillness of the water is most navigable up and down the\r\nstream; by reason whereof London, standing almost in the middle of that\r\ncourse, is more commodiously served with provision of necessaries than\r\nany town standing upon the other two rivers can be, and doth also more\r\neasily communicate to the rest of the realm the commodities of her own\r\nintercourse and traffic.\r\n\r\nThis river openeth indifferently upon France and Flanders, our mightiest\r\nneighbours, to whose doings we ought to have a bent eye and special\r\nregard; and this city standeth thereon in such convenient distance\r\nfrom the sea, as it is not only near enough for intelligence of the\r\naffairs of those princes, and for the resistance of their attempts,\r\nbut also sufficiently removed from the fear of any sudden dangers that\r\nmay be offered by them; whereas for the prince of this realm to dwell\r\nupon Trent were to turn his back or blind side to his most dangerous\r\nborderers; and for him to rest and dwell upon Severn were to be shut up\r\nin a cumbersome corner, which openeth but upon Ireland only, a place of\r\nmuch less importance.\r\n\r\nNeither could London be pitched so commodiously upon any other part\r\nof the same river of Thames as where it now standeth; for if it were\r\nremoved more to the west it should lose the benefit of the ebbing and\r\nflowing, and if it were seated more towards the east it should be nearer\r\nto danger of the enemy, and further both from the good air and from\r\ndoing good to the inner parts of the realm; neither may I omit that none\r\nother place is so plentifully watered with springs as London is.\r\n\r\nAnd whereas, amongst other things, corn and cattle, hay and fuel, be of\r\ngreat necessity; of the which cattle may be driven from afar, and corn\r\nmay easily be transported. But hay and fuel, being of greater bulk and\r\nburthen, must be at hand: only London, by the benefit of this situation\r\nand river, may be sufficiently served therewith. In which respect an\r\nalderman of London reasonably (as me thought) affirmed, that although\r\nLondon received great nourishment by the residence of the prince, the\r\nrepair of the parliament and courts of justice, yet it stood principally\r\nby the advantage of the situation upon the river; for when, as on a\r\ntime, it was told him by a courtier that Queen Mary, in her displeasure\r\nagainst London, had appointed to remove with the parliament and term to\r\nOxford, this plain man demanded whether she meant also to divert the\r\nriver of Thames from London, or no? and when the gentleman had answered\r\n“No,” “Then,” quoth the alderman, “by God’s grace, we shall do well\r\nenough at London, whatsoever become of the term and parliament.” I\r\nmyself being then a young scholar at Oxford, did see great preparation\r\nmade towards that term and parliament, and do well remember that the\r\ncommon opinion and voice was, that they were not holden there, because\r\nprovision of hay could not be made in all the country to serve for ten\r\nwhole days together, and yet is that quarter plentifully stored with hay\r\nfor the proportion of the shire itself.\r\n\r\nFor proof of the ancient estimation of London, I will not use the\r\nauthority of the British history, nor of such as follow it (although\r\nsome hold it credible enough that London was first _Trinobantum\r\ncivitas_, or _Troja nova_, that famous city in our histories, and then\r\nLudstoune, and by corruption London, as they report), because they be\r\nnot of sufficient force to draw the gainsayers. Neither will I stand\r\nmuch upon that honourable testimony which Gervas. Tilburiens. giveth to\r\nLondon in his book, _De Otiis Imperialibus_, saying thus, concerning\r\nthe blessing of God towards it:--“_In Urbe London. exceptione habet\r\ndivulgatum id per omnes æquè gentes Lucani proverbium_:\r\n\r\n    Invida fatorum series summisque negatum\r\n    Stare diu.\r\n\r\n“_Nam ea annis 354 ante Romam condita nunquam amisit principatum, nec\r\nbello consumpta est._”\r\n\r\nBut I will rather use the credit of one or two ancient foreign writers,\r\nand then descend to later histories. Cornel. Tacitus, lib. 4. Annal.,\r\nsaith, “_Londinum copia negociatorum, et comeatu maxime celebris_,” and\r\nHerodian, in the Life of Severus the emperor, saith, “_Londinum urbs\r\nmagna et opulenta_.” Beda, lib. Ecclesiastic. 10. chap. 29, showeth\r\nthat Pope Gregory appointed two archbishops’ sees in England, the one\r\nat London, the other at York. King Ethelstane, in his laws, appointing\r\nhow many mint-masters should be in each city, allotteth eight to London,\r\nand not so many to any other city. The penner of those laws, that are\r\nsaid to be made by Edward the Confessor, and confirmed by William the\r\nConqueror, saith, “_London est caput Regni, et Legum_.” King Henry I.,\r\nin the third chapter of his Laws, commandeth that no citizen of London\r\nshould be amerced above one hundred shillings for any pecuniary pain.\r\nThe great charter of England, that Helena for which there was so long\r\nand so great war and contention, in the ninth chapter, saith, “_Civitas\r\nLondon. habeat omnes suas Libertates antiquas_,” etc. About the time of\r\nKing John London was reputed “_regni firmata Columna_,” as Alexander\r\nNeckham writeth; and in the beginning of the reign of Richard II. it was\r\ncalled “_Camera regis_,” as Thomas Walsingham reporteth. I pass over the\r\nrecital of the Saxon charter of King William the Conqueror, the Latin\r\ncharter of Henry I. and II., of Richard I., of John, and of Edward I.,\r\nall which gave unto the citizens of London great privileges, and of\r\nEdward III., who reciting all the grants of his predecessors, not only\r\nconfirmed but also increased the same, and of the latter kings, who\r\nhave likewise added many things thereunto. Only I wish to be noted by\r\nthem, that during all this time, all those wise and politic princes have\r\nthought it fit, not only to maintain London in such plight as they found\r\nit, but also to adorn, increase, and amplify it with singular tokens\r\nof their liberal favour and good liking. And whether there be not now\r\nthe same or greater causes to draw the like, or better estimation and\r\ncherishing, let any man be judge, that will take the pains to compare\r\nthe present estate of London, yet still growing to better, with the\r\nformer condition of the same.\r\n\r\nIt were too much to recite particularly the martial services that this\r\ncity hath done from time to time; neither do I think that they be all\r\ncommitted to writing; only for a taste, as it were, I will note these\r\nfew following.\r\n\r\nAlmost sixty years before the Conquest a huge army of the Danes (whereof\r\nKing Sweyne was the leader) besieged King Etheldred in London (than the\r\nwhich, as the story saith, then he had none other refuge), but they were\r\nmanfully repulsed, and a great number of them slain.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of this Sweyne, his son Canutus (afterward king of\r\nEngland) besieged London, both by land and water; but after much labour,\r\nfinding it impregnable, he departed; and in the same year repairing his\r\nforces, he girded it with a new siege, in the which the citizens so\r\ndefended themselves, and offended him, that in the end he went away with\r\nshame.\r\n\r\nIn the dissension that arose between King Edward the Confessor and his\r\nfather-in-law, Earl Goodwin (which was the mightiest subject within\r\nthis land that ever I have read of), the earl with a great army came\r\nto London, and was for all that by the countenance of the citizens\r\nresisted, till such time as the nobility made reconciliation between\r\nthem. About seventy years after the Conquest, Maude, the empress, made\r\nwar upon King Stephen for the right of the crown, and had taken his\r\nperson prisoner; but, by the strength and assistance of the Londoners\r\nand Kentishmen, Maude was put to flight at Winchester, and her brother\r\nRobert, then earl of Gloucester, was taken, in exchange for whom King\r\nStephen was delivered: I dispute not whose right was better, but I\r\navouch the service, seeing Stephen was in possession.\r\n\r\nThe history of William Walworth, the mayor of London, is well known; by\r\nwhose manhood and policy the person of King Richard II. was rescued,\r\nthe city saved, Wat Tiler killed, and all his straglers discomfited; in\r\nreward of which service, the mayor and other aldermen were knighted.\r\n\r\nJack Cade also having discomfited the king’s army that was sent against\r\nhim, came to London, and was there manfully and with long fight\r\nresisted, until that by the good policy of the citizens his company was\r\ndispersed.\r\n\r\nFinally, in the 10th year of the reign of King Edward IV., and not many\r\ndays before the death of Henry VI., Thomas Nevill, commonly called the\r\nbastard of Fauconbridge, armed a great company against the king, and\r\nbeing denied passage through London, he assaulted it on divers parts;\r\nbut he was repulsed by the citizens, and chased as far as Stratford,\r\nwith the loss of a great many.\r\n\r\nThus much of certain their principal and personal services in war\r\nonly, for it were infinite to repeat the particular aids of men and\r\nmoney which London hath ministered; and I had rather to leave it to be\r\nconjectured at, by comparison to be made between it and other cities,\r\nwhereof I will give you this one note for an example. In the 12th year\r\nof the reign of King Edward II., it was ordered by parliament that every\r\ncity of the realm should make out soldiers against the Scots; at which\r\ntime London was appointed to send two hundred men, and Canterbury, being\r\nthen one of our best cities, forty, and no more: and this proportion\r\nof five to one is now in our age increased, at the least five to one,\r\nboth in soldiers and subsidy. As for the other services that London hath\r\ndone in times of peace, they are to be measured by consideration of the\r\ncommodities, whereof I will speak anon. In the mean season, let the\r\nestate and government of this city be considered, to the end that it may\r\nappear that it standeth well with the policy of the realm.\r\n\r\nCæsar, in his Commentaries, is witness, that in his time the cities\r\nof Britain had large territories annexed unto them, and were several\r\nestates of themselves, governed by particular kings, or potentates,\r\nas in Italy and Germany yet be; and that Mandubratius was king of the\r\nTrinobants, whose chief city London is taken to have been. And I find\r\nnot that this government was altered either by Cæsar or his successors,\r\nnotwithstanding that the country became tributary unto them: but that\r\nit continued until at length the Britons themselves reduced all their\r\npeoples into one monarchy; howbeit, that lasted not any long season,\r\nfor upon Vortiger their king came the Saxons our ancestors, and they\r\ndrave the Britons into Wales, Cornwall, and Bretagne in France, and\r\nin process of war divided the country amongst themselves into an\r\nheptarchy, or seven kingdoms; of the which one was called the kingdom\r\nof the East Saxons, which having in manner the same limits that the\r\nbishopric of London now enjoyeth, contained Essex, Middlesex, and a part\r\nof Hertfordshire, and so included London. Again, it appeareth, that\r\nin course of time, and about eight hundred years after Christ, Egbert\r\n(then king of the West Saxons), _ut pisces sæpe minutos magnus comest_,\r\novercame the rest of the kings, and once more erected a monarchy; the\r\nwhich till the coming in of the Normans, and from thence even hitherto\r\nhath continued.\r\n\r\nNow I doubt not (whatsoever London was in the time of Cæsar), but\r\nthat under the heptarchy and monarchy it hath been a subject, and no\r\nfree city, though happily endowed with some large privileges, for\r\nKing William the Conqueror found a portreeve there, whose name was\r\nGodfrey (by which name he greeteth him in his Saxon Charter), and his\r\noffice was none other than the charge of a bailiff or reeve, as by the\r\nself-same name continuing yet in Gravesend, and certain other places,\r\nmay well appear: but the Frenchmen, using their own language, called\r\nhim sometimes a provost and sometime a bailiff: whatsoever his name and\r\noffice were, he was _perpetuus magistratus_, given by the prince, and\r\nnot chosen by the citizens, as it seemeth; for what time King Richard\r\nI. needed money towards his expedition in the Holy Land, they first\r\npurchased of him the liberty to choose yearly from amongst themselves\r\ntwo bailiffs; and King John, his successor, at their like suit, changed\r\ntheir bailiffs into a mayor and two sheriffs. To these Henry III. added\r\naldermen, at the first eligible yearly, but afterward by King Edward\r\nIII. made perpetual magistrates and justices of the peace within their\r\nwards, in which plight of government it presently standeth. This,\r\nshortly as I could, is the historical and outward estate of London; now\r\ncome I to the inward pith and substance.\r\n\r\nThe estate of this city is to be examined by the quantity and by the\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nThe quantity therefore consisteth in the number of the citizens which\r\nis very great, and far exceedeth the proportion of Hippodamus, which\r\nappointed ten thousand, and of others which have set down other numbers,\r\nas meet stintes in their opinions to be well governed; but yet seeing\r\nboth reason and experience have freed us from the law of any definite\r\nnumber, so that other things be observed, let that be admitted: neither\r\nis London, I fear me, so great as populous; for well saith one, “_Non\r\nidem est magna civitas et frequens, magna est enim quæ multos habet qui\r\narma ferre possunt_:” whatsoever the number be, it breedeth no fear of\r\nsedition; forasmuch as the same consisteth not in the extremes, but in a\r\nvery mediocrity of wealth and riches, as it shall better appear anon.\r\n\r\nAnd if the causes of English rebellions be searched out, they shall be\r\nfound in effect to be these twain, ambition and covetousness; of which\r\nthe first reigneth in the minds of high and noble personages, or of\r\nsuch others as seek to be gracious and popular, and have robbed the\r\nhearts of the multitude; whereas in London, if any where in the world,\r\n_honos vere onus est_, and every man rather shunneth than seeketh the\r\nmayoralty, which is the best mark amongst them; neither hath there been\r\nany strong faction, nor any man more popular than the rest, forasmuch\r\nas the government is by a pattern, as it were, and always the same, how\r\noften soever they change their magistrate. Covetousness, that other\r\nsire of sedition, possesseth the miserable and needy sort, and such as\r\nbe naughty packs, unthrifts, which although it cannot be chosen, but\r\nthat in a frequent city as London is, there shall be found many, yet\r\nbear they not any great sway, seeing the multitude and most part there\r\nis of a competent wealth, and earnestly bent to honest labour. I confess\r\nthat London is a mighty arm and instrument to bring any great desire to\r\neffect, if it may be known to a man’s devotion; whereof also there want\r\nnot examples in the English history. But forasmuch as the same is, by\r\nthe like reason, serviceable and meet to impeach any disloyal attempt,\r\nlet it rather be well governed than evil liked therefore; for it shall\r\nappear anon, that as London hath adhered to some rebellions, so hath\r\nit resisted many, and was never the author of any one. The quality of\r\nthis city consisteth either in the law and government thereof, or in the\r\ndegrees and condition of the citizens or in their strength and riches.\r\n\r\nIt is besides the purpose to dispute, whether the estate of the\r\ngovernment here be a democracy or aristocracy; for whatever it be, being\r\nconsidered in itself, certain it is, that in respect of the whole realm,\r\nLondon is but a citizen and no city, a subject and no free estate, an\r\nobedienciary and no place endowed with any distinct or absolute power;\r\nfor it is governed by the same law that the rest of the realm is, both\r\nin causes criminal and civil, a few customs only excepted, which also\r\nare to be adjudged or forejudged by the common law. And in the assembly\r\nof the estates of our realm (which we call parliament) they are but a\r\nmember of the commonalty, and send two burgesses for their city, as\r\nevery poor borough doth, and two knights for their county, as every\r\nother shire doth; and are as straitly bound by such laws as any part of\r\nthe realm is, for if contribution in subsidy of money to the prince be\r\ndecreed, the Londoners have none exemption; no, not so much as to assess\r\nthemselves, for the prince doth appoint the commissioners.\r\n\r\nIf soldiers must be mustered, Londoners have no law to keep themselves\r\nat home; if provision for the prince’s household be to be made, their\r\ngoods are not privileged. In sum, therefore, the government of London\r\ndiffereth not in substance, but in ceremony, from the rest of the\r\nrealm, as, namely, in the names and choice of their officers, and in\r\ntheir guilds and fraternities, established for the maintenance of\r\nhandicrafts and labourers, and for equity and good order to be kept in\r\nbuying and selling. And yet in these also are they to be controlled by\r\nthe general law; for by the statutes, 28 Edward III. chap. 10, and 1\r\nHenry IV. chap. 15, the points of their misgovernment are inquirable by\r\nthe inhabitants of the foreign shires adjoining, and punishable by such\r\njusticiars as the prince shall thereunto depute: to conclude, therefore,\r\nthe estate of London, for government, is so agreeable a symphony with\r\nthe rest, that there is no fear of dangerous discord to ensue thereby.\r\n\r\nThe multitude (or whole body) of this populous city is two ways to\r\nbe considered, generally and specially: generally, they be natural\r\nsubjects, a part of the commons of this realm, and are by birth\r\nfor the most part a mixture of all countries of the same; by blood\r\ngentlemen, yeomen, and of the basest sort, without distinction, and by\r\nprofession busy bees, and travailers for their living in the hive of\r\nthis commonwealth; but specially considered, they consist of these three\r\nparts,--merchants, handicraftsmen, and labourers.\r\n\r\nMerchandise is also divided into these three sorts,--navigation, by the\r\nwhich merchandizes are brought, and carried in and out over the seas;\r\ninvection, by the which commodities are gathered into the city, and\r\ndispersed from thence into the country by land and negotiation, which I\r\nmay call the keeping of a retailing or standing shop. In common speech,\r\nthey of the first sort be called merchants, and both the other retailers.\r\n\r\nHandicraftsmen be those which do exercise such arts as require both\r\nlabour and cunning, as goldsmiths, tailors, and haberdashers, skinners,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nLabourers and hirelings I call those _quorum operæ non artes emuntur_,\r\nas Tullie saith; of which sort be porters, carmen, watermen, etc.\r\n\r\nAgain, these three sorts may be considered, either in respect of their\r\nwealth or number: in wealth, merchants and some of the chief retailers\r\nhave the first place; the most part of retailers and all artificers the\r\nsecond or mean place; and hirelings the lowest room: but in number they\r\nof the middle place be first, and do far exceed both the rest; hirelings\r\nbe next, and merchants be the last. Now, out of this, that the estate of\r\nLondon, in the persons of the citizens, is so friendly interlaced, and\r\nknit in league with the rest of the realm, not only at their beginning\r\nby birth and blood, as I have showed, but also very commonly at their\r\nending by life and conversation, for that merchants and rich men (being\r\nsatisfied with gain) do for the most part marry their children into the\r\ncountry, and convey themselves, after Cicero’s counsel, “_Veluti ex\r\nportu in agros et possessiones_:” I do infer that there is not only\r\nno danger towards the common quiet thereby, but also great occasion\r\nand cause of good love and amity. Out of this, that they be generally\r\nbent to travel, and do fly poverty, “_Per mare, per saxa, per ignes_,”\r\nas the poet saith: I draw hope that they shall escape the note of many\r\nvices which idle people do fall into. And out of this, that they be\r\na great multitude, and that yet the greatest part of them be neither\r\ntoo rich nor too poor, but do live in the mediocrity, I conclude with\r\nAristotle, that the prince needeth not to fear sedition by them, for\r\nthus saith he: “_Magnæ urbes magis sunt a seditione liberæ, quod in eis\r\ndominetur mediocritas; nam in parvis nihil medium est, sunt enim omnes\r\nvel pauperes vel opulenti._” I am now to come to the strength and power\r\nof this city, which consisteth partly in the number of the citizens\r\nthemselves, whereof I have spoken before, partly in their riches, and\r\nin their warlike furniture; for as touching the strength of the place\r\nitself, that is apparent to the eye, and therefore is not to be treated\r\nof.\r\n\r\nThe wealth and warlike furniture of London is either public or private,\r\nand no doubt the common treasure cannot be much there, seeing that the\r\nrevenue which they have hardly sufficeth to maintain their bridge and\r\nconduits, and to pay their officers and servants. Their toll doth not\r\nany more than pay their fee farm, that they pay to the prince. Their\r\nissues for default of appearances be never levied, and the profits of\r\ntheir courts of justice do go to particular men’s hands. Arguments\r\nhereof be these two: one, that they can do nothing of extraordinary\r\ncharge without a general contribution; another, that they have suffered\r\nsuch as have borne the chief office amongst them, and were become\r\nbankrupt, to depart the city without relief, which I think they neither\r\nwould nor could have done, if the common treasure had sufficed to cover\r\ntheir shame; hereof therefore we need not be afraid. The public armour\r\nand munition of this city remaineth in the halls of the companies, as\r\nit doth throughout the whole realm, for a great part in the parish\r\nchurches; neither is that kept together, but only for obedience to the\r\nlaw, which commandeth it, and therefore if that threaten danger to the\r\nestate, it may by another law be taken from them, and committed to a\r\nmore safe armoury.\r\n\r\nThe private riches of London resteth chiefly in the hands of the\r\nmerchants and retailers, for artificers have not much to spare, and\r\nlabourers have need that it were given unto them. Now how necessary\r\nand serviceable the estate of merchandise is to this realm, it may\r\npartly appear by the practice of that peaceable, politic, and rich\r\nprince, King Henry VII., of whom Polidore (writing his life) sayeth\r\nthus: “_Mercatores ille sæpenumero pecunia multa data gratuite juvabat,\r\nut mercatura ars una omnium cunctis æque mortalibus tum commoda,\r\ntum necessaria, in suo regno copiosior esset_.” But chiefly by the\r\ninestimable commodities that grow thereby: for who knoweth not that we\r\nhave extreme need of many things, whereof foreign countries have great\r\nstore, and that we may spare many things whereof they have need: or who\r\nis ignorant of this, that we have no mines of silver or gold within\r\nour realm, so that the increase of our coin and bullion cometh from\r\nelsewhere; and yet nevertheless we be both fed, clad, and otherwise\r\nserved with foreign commodities and delights, as plentiful as with our\r\ndomestical; which thing cometh to pass by the mean of merchandise only,\r\nwhich importeth necessaries from other countries, and exporteth the\r\nsuperfluities of our own.\r\n\r\nFor seeing we have no way to increase our treasure by mines of gold or\r\nsilver at home, and can have nothing without money or ware from other\r\ncountries abroad, it followeth necessarily, that if we follow the\r\ncounsel of that good old husband, Marcus Cato, saying, “_Oportet patrem\r\nfamilias vendacem esse, non emacem_,” and do carry more commodities in\r\nvalue over the seas than we bring hither from thence, that then the\r\nrealm shall receive that overplus in money; but if we bring from beyond\r\nthe seas merchandise of more value than that which we do send over may\r\ncountervail, then the realm payeth for that overplus in ready money,\r\nand consequently is a loser by that ill husbandry; and therefore in\r\nthis part great and heedful regard must be had that symmetry and due\r\nproportion be kept, lest otherwise either the realm be defrauded of her\r\ntreasure, or the subjects corrupted in vanity, by excessive importation\r\nof superfluous and needless merchandise, or else that we feel penury,\r\neven in our greatest plenty and store, by immoderate exportation of our\r\nown needful commodities.\r\n\r\nOther the benefits that merchandise bringeth shall hereafter appear\r\nin the general recital of the commodities that come by London; and\r\ntherefore it resteth that I speak a word of retailers, and finally\r\nshow that much good groweth by them both. The chief part of retailing\r\nis but a handmaid to merchandise, dispersing by piecemeal that which\r\nthe merchant bringeth in gross; of which trade be mercers, vintners,\r\nhaberdashers, ironmongers, milliners, and all such as sell wares growing\r\nor made beyond the seas; and therefore so long as merchandise itself\r\nshall be profitable, and such proportion kept as neither we lose our\r\ntreasure thereby, nor be cloyed with unnecessary foreign wares, this\r\nkind of retailing is to be retained also.\r\n\r\nNow that merchants and retailers of London be very rich and great,\r\nit is so far from any harm, that it is a thing both praiseworthy and\r\nprofitable; for “_Mercatura_ (saith Cicero), _si tenuis est, sordida\r\nputanda est; sin magna est et copiosa, non est vituperanda_.” And truly\r\nmerchants and retailers do not altogether _intus canere_, and profit\r\nthemselves only, for the prince and realm both are enriched by their\r\nriches: the realm winneth treasure, if their trade be so moderated by\r\nauthority that it break not proportion, and they besides bear a good\r\nfleece, which the prince may shear when he seeth good.\r\n\r\nBut here, before I conclude this part, I have shortly to answer the\r\naccusation of those men, which charge London with the loss and decay\r\nof many (or most) of the ancient cities, corporate towns, and markets\r\nwithin this realm, by drawing from them to herself alone, say they, both\r\nall trade of traffic by sea, and the retailing of wares and exercise\r\nof manual arts also. Touching navigation, which I must confess is\r\napparently decayed in many port towns, and flourisheth only or chiefly\r\nat London, I impute that partly to the fall of the Staple, the which\r\nbeing long since a great trade, and bestowed sometimes at one town and\r\nsometimes at another within the realm, did much enrich the place where\r\nit was, and being now not only diminished in force, but also translated\r\nover the seas, cannot but bring some decay with it, partly to the\r\nimpairing of havens, which in many places have impoverished those towns,\r\nwhose estate doth ebb and flow with them, and partly to the dissolution\r\nof religious houses, by whose wealth and haunt many of those places were\r\nchiefly fed and nourished. I mean not to rehearse particular examples of\r\nevery sort, for the thing itself speaketh, and I haste to an end.\r\n\r\nAs for retailers, therefore, and handicraftsmen, it is no marvel if they\r\nabandon country towns, and resort to London; for not only the court,\r\nwhich is now-a-days much greater and more gallant than in former times,\r\nand which was wont to be contented to remain with a small company,\r\nsometimes at an abbey or priory, sometimes at a bishop’s house, and\r\nsometimes at some mean manor of the king’s own, is now for the most part\r\neither abiding at London, or else so near unto it, that the provision\r\nof things most fit for it may easily be fetched from thence; but also by\r\noccasion thereof, the gentlemen of all shires do fly and flock to this\r\ncity; the younger sort of them to see and show vanity, and the elder to\r\nsave the cost and charge of hospitality and house-keeping.\r\n\r\nFor hereby it cometh to pass, that the gentlemen being either for a\r\ngood portion of the year out of the country, or playing the farmers,\r\ngraziers, brewers, or such like, more than gentlemen were wont to do\r\nwithin the country, retailers and artificers, at the least of such\r\nthings as pertain to the back or belly, do leave the country towns,\r\nwhere there is no vent, and do fly to London, where they be sure to\r\nfind ready and quick market. And yet I wish, that even as many towns in\r\nthe low countries of King Philip do stand, some by one handy art, and\r\nsome by another; so also that it might be provided here that the making\r\nof some things might (by discreet dispensation) be allotted to some\r\nspecial towns, to the end, that although the daintiness of men cannot\r\nbe restrained, which will needs seek those things at London, yet other\r\nplaces also might be relieved, at the least by the workmanship of them.\r\n\r\nThus much then of the estate of London, in the government thereof, in\r\nthe condition of the citizens, and in their power and riches. Now follow\r\nthe enumeration of such benefits as redound to the prince and this realm\r\nby this city: in which doing I profess not to rehearse all, but only to\r\nrecite and run over the chief and principal of them.\r\n\r\nBesides the commodities of the furtherance of religion and justice,\r\nthe propagation of learning, the maintenance of arts, the increase of\r\nriches, and the defence of countries (all which are before showed to\r\ngrow generally by cities, and be common to London with them), London\r\nbringeth singularly these good things following.\r\n\r\nBy advantage of the situation it disperseth foreign wares (as the\r\nstomach doth meat) to all the members most commodiously.\r\n\r\nBy the benefit of the river of Thames, and great trade of merchandise,\r\nit is the chief maker of mariners, and nurse of our navy; and ships (as\r\nmen know) be the wooden walls for defence of our realm.\r\n\r\nIt maintaineth in flourishing estate the countries of Norfolk, Suffolk,\r\nEssex, Kent, and Sussex, which as they lie in the face of our most\r\npuissant neighbour, so ought they above others to be conserved in the\r\ngreatest strength and riches; and these, as it is well known, stand not\r\nso much by the benefit of their own soil, as by the neighbourhood and\r\nnearness which they have to London.\r\n\r\nIt relieveth plentifully, and with good policy, not only her own poor\r\npeople, a thing which scarcely any other town or shire doth, but also\r\nthe poor that from each quarter of the realm do flock unto it, and it\r\nimparteth liberally to the necessity of the universities besides. It is\r\nan ornament to the realm by the beauty thereof, and a terror to other\r\ncountries, by reason of the great wealth and frequency. It spreadeth the\r\nhonour of our country far abroad by her long navigations, and maketh our\r\npower feared, even of barbarous princes. It only is stored with rich\r\nmerchants, which sort only is tolerable; for beggarly merchants do bite\r\ntoo near, and will do more harm than good to the realm.\r\n\r\nIt only of any place in this realm is able to furnish the sudden\r\nnecessity with a strong army. It availeth the prince in tronage,\r\npoundage, and other her customs, much more than all the rest of the\r\nrealm.\r\n\r\nIt yieldeth a greater subsidy than any one part of the realm; I mean\r\nnot for the proportion of the value of the goods only, but also for the\r\nfaithful service there used, in making the assess, for no where else\r\nbe men taxed so near to their just value as in London; yea, many are\r\nfound there, that for their countenance and credit sake, refuse not to\r\nbe rated above their ability, which thing never happeneth abroad in the\r\ncountry. I omit that in ancient time the inhabitants of London and other\r\ncities were accustomably taxed after the tenth of their goods, when the\r\ncountry was assessed at the fifteenth, and rated at the eighth; when the\r\ncountry was set at the twelfth, for that were to awake a sleeping dog;\r\nand I should be thought “_dicenda, tacenda, locutus_,” as the poet said.\r\n\r\nIt only doth and is able to make the prince a ready present or loan of\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nIt only is found fit and able to entertain strangers honourably, and to\r\nreceive the prince of the realm worthily.\r\n\r\nAlmighty God (_qui nisi custodiat civitatem, frustrà vigilat custos_)\r\ngrant that her majesty evermore rightly esteem and rule this city; and\r\nhe give grace, that the citizens may answer duty, as well towards God\r\nand her majesty, as towards this whole realm and country. Amen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN APPENDIX, CONTAINING THE EXAMINATION OF SUCH CAUSES AS HAVE\r\nHERETOFORE MOVED THE PRINCES EITHER TO FINE AND RANSOM THE CITIZENS OF\r\nLONDON, OR TO SEIZE THE LIBERTIES OF THE CITY ITSELF.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese all may be reduced to these few heads; for either the citizens\r\nhave adhered, in aid or arms, to such as have warred upon the prince, or\r\nthey have made tumult, and broken the common peace at home; or they have\r\nmisbehaved themselves in point of government and justice; or finally,\r\nand to speak the plain truth, the princes have taken hold of small\r\nmatters, and coined good sums of money out of them.\r\n\r\nTo the first head I will refer whatsoever they have done, either in\r\nthose wars that happened between King Stephen and Maude the empress,\r\nbeing competitors of the crown, or between King John and his nobles,\r\nassisting Lewis, the French king’s son, when he invaded the realm; for\r\nit is apparent by all histories that the Londoners were not the movers\r\nof these wars, but were only used as instruments to maintain them. The\r\nlike is to be said of all the offences that King Henry III., whose whole\r\nreign was a continual warfare, conceived against this city, concerning\r\nthe bearing of armour against him; for the first part of his reign was\r\nspent in the continuation of those wars that his father had begun with\r\nLewis; and the rest of his life he bestowed in that contention, which\r\nwas commonly called the Barons’ wars: in which tragedy London, as it\r\ncould not be otherwise, had now and then a part, and had many a snub\r\nat the king’s hand for it: but in the end, when he had triumphed over\r\nSimon Montford at Evesham, London felt it most tragical; for then he\r\nboth seized their liberties and sucked themselves dry; and yet Edictum\r\nKenilworth, made shortly after, hath an honourable testimony for London,\r\nsaying, “_Te London laudamus_,” etc. As for the other offences that\r\nhe took against the Londoners, they pertain to the other parts of my\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\nNext after this, against whom the Londoners did put on arms, followeth\r\nKing Edward II., who in the end was deprived of his kingdom, not by\r\ntheir means, but by a general defection both of his own wife and son,\r\nand almost of the whole nobility and realm besides. In which trouble,\r\nthat furious assault and slaughter committed by them upon the bishop of\r\nExcester, then treasurer of the realm, is to be imputed partly to the\r\nsway of the time wherewith they were carried, and partly to a private\r\ndispleasure which they had to the bishop.\r\n\r\nFinally cometh to hand King Richard II.; for these three only, in all\r\nthe catalogue of our kings, have been heavy lords to London, who also\r\nhad much contention with his nobility, and was in the end deposed. But\r\nwhatsoever countenance and aid the city of London brought to the wars\r\nand uproars of that time, it is notoriously true that London never led\r\nthe dance, but ever followed the pipe of the nobility. To close up this\r\nfirst part, therefore, I affirm, that in all the troublesome actions\r\nduring the reign of these three kings, as also in all that heaving in\r\nand hurling out that afterward happened between King Henry VI. and King\r\nEdward IV., the city of London was many times a friend and fautor, but\r\nnever the first motive or author of any intestine war or sedition.\r\n\r\nIn the second room I place a couple of tumultuous affrays that chanced\r\nin the days of King Richard I.; the one upon the day of his coronation\r\nagainst the Jews, which, contrary to the king’s own proclamation, would\r\nneeds enter the church to see him sacred, and were therefore cruelly\r\nhandled by the common people. The other was caused by William with the\r\nlong beard, who after that he had inflamed the poor people against the\r\nricher sort, and was called to answer for his fault, took Bow church for\r\nsanctuary, and kept it, castle-like, till he was fired out.\r\n\r\nHere is place also for the stoning to death of a gentleman, servant\r\nto the half-brother of King Henry III., which had before provoked the\r\ncitizens to fury by wounding divers of them without any cause, 1257;\r\nfor the riotous fray between the servants of the goldsmiths and the\r\ntailors, 1268; for the hurly burly and bloodshed between the Londoners\r\nand the men of Westminster, moved by the young men upon an occasion of\r\na wrestling on St. James’ day, 1221; and made worse by one Constantine,\r\nan ancient citizen, for the brawl and business that arose about a\r\nbaker’s loaf at Salisbury place, 1391; for the which, and some other\r\nmisdemeanours, King Richard II. was so incensed by evil counsel against\r\nthe Londoners, that he determined to destroy them and raze their city:\r\nand for the fight that was between the citizens and sanctuary men of St.\r\nMartin’s, 1454, under King Henry VI.: and finally, for the misrule on\r\nevil May-day 1519, and for such other like, if there have been any.\r\n\r\nTo the third head may be referred the seizure of their liberties, for\r\na false judgment given against a poor widow, called Margaret Viel,\r\n1246; the two several seizures in one year, 1258, for false packing in\r\ncollections of money and other enormities; and finally the seizure made\r\nby King Edward I. for taking of bribes of the bakers, 1285. But all this\r\nsecurity in seizing and resuming of the liberties, which was in old time\r\nthe only ordinary punishment, was at length mitigated by King Edward\r\nIII. and King Henry IV., in their statutes before remembered.\r\n\r\nIn the last place stand those offences, which I repute rather taken\r\nthan given, and do fall within the measure of the adage, “_Ut canem\r\ncædas, cito invenias baculum_:” for King John, in the 10th of his reign,\r\ndeposed the bailiffs of London, because they had bought up the wheat in\r\nthe market, so that there was not to serve his purveyors. King Henry\r\nIII., his son, compelled the Londoners to pay him five thousand pounds,\r\nbecause they had lent to Lewis, the French king, the like sum, of a good\r\nmind to dispatch him out of their city and the realm, at such time as\r\nthe protector and the whole nobility fell to composition with him for\r\nhis departure. And the same king fined them at three thousand marks for\r\nthe escape of a prisoner out of Newgate, of whom they took no charge;\r\nfor he was a clerk, prisoner to the bishop of London, under the custody\r\nof his own servants; and as for the place, it was only borrowed of the\r\nLondoners to serve that turn. Hitherto of these things to this end, that\r\nwhatsoever misdemeanour shall be objected out of history against London,\r\nthe same may herein appear, both in its true place and proper colour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFITZSTEPHEN’S DESCRIPTION OF LONDON\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE SITUATION OF THE SAME\r\n\r\nAmongst the noble and celebrated cities of the world, that of London,\r\nthe capital of the kingdom of England, is one of the most renowned,\r\npossessing above all others abundant wealth, extensive commerce, great\r\ngrandeur and magnificence. It is happy in the salubrity of its climate,\r\nin the profession of the Christian religion, in the strength of its\r\nfortresses, the nature of its situation, the honour of its citizens, and\r\nthe chastity of its matrons; in its sports too it is most pleasant, and\r\nin the production of illustrious men most fortunate. All which things I\r\nwish separately to consider.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE MILDNESS OF THE CLIMATE\r\n\r\nThere then\r\n\r\n    “Men’s minds are soft’ned by a temp’rate clime,”\r\n\r\nnot so however that they are addicted to licentiousness, but so that\r\nthey are not savage and brutal, but rather kind and generous.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE RELIGION\r\n\r\nThere is in St. Paul’s church an episcopal see: it was formerly\r\nmetropolitan, and, it is thought, will be so again, should the citizens\r\nreturn to the island: unless perhaps the archiepiscopal title of St.\r\nThomas, and his bodily presence there, should always retain that dignity\r\nat Canterbury, where it now is. But as St. Thomas has ennobled both\r\nthese cities, London by his birth, and Canterbury by his death, each of\r\nthem, with respect to the saint, has much to allege against the other,\r\nand with justice too. As regards divine worship, there are also in\r\nLondon and in the suburbs thirteen larger conventual churches, besides\r\none hundred and thirty-six lesser parochial ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE STRENGTH OF THE CITY\r\n\r\nOn the east stands the Palatine tower, a fortress of great size and\r\nstrength, the court and walls of which are erected upon a very deep\r\nfoundation, the mortar used in the building being tempered with the\r\nblood of beasts. On the west are two castles strongly fortified; the\r\nwall of the city is high and thick, with seven double gates, having on\r\nthe north side towers placed at proper intervals. London formerly had\r\nwalls and towers in like manner on the south, but that most excellent\r\nriver the Thames, which abounds with fish, and in which the tide ebbs\r\nand flows, runs on that side, and has in a long space of time washed\r\ndown, undermined, and subverted the walls in that part. On the west\r\nalso, higher up on the bank of the river, the royal palace rears its\r\nhead, an incomparable structure, furnished with a breastwork and\r\nbastions, situated in a populous suburb, at a distance of two miles from\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE GARDENS\r\n\r\nAdjoining to the houses on all sides lie the gardens of those citizens\r\nthat dwell in the suburbs, which are well furnished with trees, spacious\r\nand beautiful.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE PASTURE AND TILLAGE LANDS\r\n\r\nOn the north side too are fields for pasture, and a delightful plain of\r\nmeadow land, interspersed with flowing streams, on which stand mills,\r\nwhose clack is very pleasing to the ear. Close by lies an immense\r\nforest, in which are densely wooded thickets, the coverts of game,\r\nstags, fallow-deer, boars, and wild bulls. The tillage lands of the city\r\nare not barren gravelly soils, but like the fertile plains of Asia,\r\nwhich produce abundant crops, and fill the barns of their cultivators\r\nwith\r\n\r\n    “Ceres’ plenteous sheaf.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE SPRINGS\r\n\r\nThere are also round London, on the northern side, in the suburbs,\r\nexcellent springs; the water of which is sweet, clear, and salubrious,\r\n\r\n    “’Mid glistening pebbles gliding playfully:”\r\n\r\namongst which, Holywell, Clerkenwell, and St. Clement’s well, are of\r\nmost note, and most frequently visited, as well by the scholars from the\r\nschools, as by the youth of the city when they go out to take the air in\r\nthe summer evenings. The city is delightful indeed, when it has a good\r\ngovernor.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE HONOUR OF THE CITIZENS\r\n\r\nThis city is ennobled by her men, graced by her arms, and peopled by a\r\nmultitude of inhabitants; so that in the wars under King Stephen there\r\nwent out to a muster, of armed horsemen, esteemed fit for war, twenty\r\nthousand, and of infantry sixty thousand. The citizens of London are\r\nrespected and noted above all other citizens for the elegance of their\r\nmanners, dress, table, and discourse.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE MATRONS\r\n\r\nThe matrons of the city are perfect Sabines.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE SCHOOLS\r\n\r\nThe three principal churches possess, by privilege and ancient dignity,\r\ncelebrated schools; yet often, by the favour of some person of note,\r\nor of some learned men eminently distinguished for their philosophy,\r\nother schools are permitted upon sufferance. On festival days the\r\nmasters assemble their pupils at those churches where the feast of the\r\npatron saint is solemnised; and there the scholars dispute, some in the\r\ndemonstrative way, and others logically; some again recite enthymemes,\r\nwhile others use the more perfect syllogism. Some, to show their\r\nabilities, engage in such disputation as is practised among persons\r\ncontending for victory alone; others dispute upon a truth, which is the\r\ngrace of perfection. The sophisters, who argue upon feigned topics,\r\nare deemed clever according to their fluency of speech and command of\r\nlanguage. Others endeavour to impose by false conclusions. Sometimes\r\ncertain orators in their rhetorical harangues employ all the powers\r\nof persuasion, taking care to observe the precepts of the art, and to\r\nomit nothing apposite to the subject. The boys of the different schools\r\nwrangle with each other in verse, and contend about the principles of\r\ngrammar or the rules of the perfect and future tenses. There are some\r\nwho in epigrams, rhymes, and verses, use that trivial raillery so much\r\npractised amongst the ancients, freely attacking their companions with\r\nFescennine licence, but suppressing the names, discharging their scoffs\r\nand sarcasms against them, touching with Socratic wit the failings of\r\ntheir schoolfellows, or perhaps of greater personages, or biting them\r\nmore keenly with a Theonine tooth. The audience,\r\n\r\n          “well disposed to laugh,\r\n    With curling nose double the quivering peals.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE MANNER IN WHICH THE AFFAIRS OF THE CITY ARE DISPOSED\r\n\r\nThe artizans of the several crafts, the vendors of the various\r\ncommodities, and the labourers of every kind, have each their separate\r\nstation, which they take every morning. There is also in London, on\r\nthe bank of the river, amongst the wine-shops which are kept in ships\r\nand cellars, a public eating-house: there every day, according to the\r\nseason, may be found viands of all kinds, roast, fried, and boiled, fish\r\nlarge and small, coarser meat for the poor, and more delicate for the\r\nrich, such as venison, fowls, and small birds. If friends, wearied with\r\ntheir journey, should unexpectedly come to a citizen’s house, and, being\r\nhungry, should not like to wait till fresh meat be bought and cooked:\r\n\r\n    “The canisters with bread are heap’d on high;\r\n    The attendants water for their hands supply:”--DRYDEN.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile some run to the river side, and there every thing that they\r\ncould wish for is instantly procured. However great the number of\r\nsoldiers or strangers that enters or leaves the city at any hour of\r\nthe day or night, they may turn in there if they please, and refresh\r\nthemselves according to their inclination; so that the former have no\r\noccasion to fast too long, or the latter to leave the city without\r\ndining. Those who wish to indulge themselves would not desire a\r\nsturgeon, or the bird of Africa, or the godwit of Ionia, when the\r\ndelicacies that are to be found there are set before them. This indeed\r\nis the public cookery, and is very convenient to the city, and a\r\ndistinguishing mark of civilisation. Hence we read in Plato’s Gorgias,\r\n“Juxta medicinam esse coquorum officium, simulantium et adulationem\r\nquartæ particulæ civilitatis.” There is, without one of the gates,\r\nimmediately in the suburb, a certain smooth field in name and in\r\nreality. There every Friday, unless it be one of the more solemn\r\nfestivals, is a noted show of well-bred horses exposed for sale. The\r\nearls, barons, and knights, who are at the time resident in the city,\r\nas well as most of the citizens, flock thither either to look on or buy.\r\nIt is pleasant to see the nags, with their sleek and shining coats,\r\nsmoothly ambling along, raising and setting down alternately, as it\r\nwere, their feet on either side: in one part are horses better adapted\r\nto esquires; these, whose pace is rougher but yet expeditious, lift up\r\nand set down, as it were, the two opposite fore and hind feet together;\r\nin another the young blood colts, not yet accustomed to the bridle,\r\n\r\n    “Which upright walk on pasterns firm and straight,\r\n    Their motions easy, prancing in their gait.”--DRYDEN.\r\n\r\nin a third are the horses for burden, strong and stout-limbed; and in\r\na fourth, the more valuable chargers, of an elegant shape and noble\r\nheight, with nimbly moving ears, erect necks, and plump haunches. In\r\nthe movements of these the purchasers observe first their easy pace,\r\nand then their gallop, which is when the fore-feet are raised from\r\nthe ground and set down together, and the hind ones in like manner,\r\nalternately. When a race is to be run by such horses as these, and\r\nperhaps by others, which in like manner, according to their breed, are\r\nstrong for carriage, and vigorous for the course, the people raise a\r\nshout, and order the common horses to be withdrawn to another part of\r\nthe field. The jockeys, who are boys expert in the management of horses,\r\nwhich they regulate by means of curb-bridles, sometimes by threes, and\r\nsometimes by twos, according as the match is made, prepare themselves\r\nfor the contest. Their chief aim is to prevent a competitor getting\r\nbefore them. The horses, too, after their manner, are eager for the\r\nrace; their limbs tremble, and, impatient of delay, they cannot stand\r\nstill; upon the signal being given, they stretch out their limbs, hurry\r\nover the course, and are borne along with unremitting speed. The riders,\r\ninspired with the love of praise and the hope of victory, clap spurs to\r\ntheir flying horses, lashing them with their whips, and inciting them by\r\ntheir shouts. You would think with Heraclitus, that all things were in\r\nmotion, and that Zeno’s opinion was altogether erroneous, when he said,\r\nthat there was no such thing as motion, and that it was impossible to\r\nreach the goal. In another quarter, apart from the rest, stand the goods\r\nof the peasants, implements of husbandry, swine with their long sides,\r\ncows with distended udders,\r\n\r\n    “Oxen of bulk immense, and woolly flocks.”\r\n\r\nThere, too, stand the mares fitted for the plough, the dray, and the\r\ncart, of which some are big with foal, others have their frolicsome\r\ncolts running close by their sides. To this city, from every nation\r\nunder heaven, merchants bring their commodities by sea,\r\n\r\n    “Arabia’s gold, Sabæa’s spice and incense,\r\n    Scythia’s keen weapons, and the oil of palms\r\n    From Babylon’s rich soil, Nile’s precious gems,\r\n    Norway’s warm peltries, Russia’s costly sables,\r\n    Sera’s rich vestures, and the wines of Gaul,\r\n    Hither are sent.”\r\n\r\nAccording to the evidence of chroniclers London is more ancient than\r\nRome: for, as both derive their origin from the same Trojan ancestors,\r\nthis was founded by Brutus before that by Romulus and Remus. Hence\r\nit is that, even to this day, both cities use the same ancient laws\r\nand ordinances. This, like Rome, is divided into wards; it has annual\r\nsheriffs instead of consuls; it has an order of senators and inferior\r\nmagistrates, and also sewers and aqueducts in its streets; each class\r\nof suits, whether of the deliberative, demonstrative, or judicial kind,\r\nhas its appropriate place and proper court; on stated days it has its\r\nassemblies. I think that there is no city in which more approved customs\r\nare observed--in attending churches, honouring God’s ordinances, keeping\r\nfestivals, giving alms, receiving strangers, confirming espousals,\r\ncontracting marriages, celebrating weddings, preparing entertainments,\r\nwelcoming guests, and also in the arrangement of the funeral ceremonies\r\nand the burial of the dead. The only inconveniences of London are,\r\nthe immoderate drinking of foolish persons, and the frequent fires.\r\nMoreover, almost all the bishops, abbots, and great men of England, are,\r\nin a manner, citizens and freemen of London; as they have magnificent\r\nhouses there, to which they resort, spending large sums of money,\r\nwhenever they are summoned thither to councils and assemblies by the\r\nking or their metropolitan, or are compelled to go there by their own\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE SPORTS\r\n\r\nLet us now proceed to the sports of the city; since it is expedient\r\nthat a city be not only an object of utility and importance, but also a\r\nsource of pleasure and diversion. Hence even in the seals of the chief\r\npontiffs, up to the time of Pope Leo, there was engraved on one side of\r\nthe Bull the figure of St. Peter as a fisherman, and above him a key\r\nstretched out to him, as it were, from heaven by the hand of God, and\r\naround him this verse--\r\n\r\n    “For me thou left’st thy ship, receive the key.”\r\n\r\nOn the obverse side was represented a city, with this inscription,\r\nGOLDEN ROME. It was also said in praise of Augustus Cæsar and the city\r\nof Rome,\r\n\r\n    “All night it rains, the shows return with day,\r\n    Cæsar, thou bear’st with Jove alternate sway.”\r\n\r\nLondon, instead of theatrical shows and scenic entertainments, has\r\ndramatic performances of a more sacred kind, either representations of\r\nthe miracles which holy confessors have wrought, or of the passions and\r\nsufferings in which the constancy of martyrs was signally displayed.\r\nMoreover, to begin with the sports of the boys (for we have all been\r\nboys), annually on the day which is called Shrovetide, the boys of the\r\nrespective schools bring each a fighting cock to their master, and\r\nthe whole of that forenoon is spent by the boys in seeing their cocks\r\nfight in the school-room. After dinner, all the young men of the city\r\ngo out into the fields to play at the well-known game of foot-ball. The\r\nscholars belonging to the several schools have each their ball; and the\r\ncity tradesmen, according to their respective crafts, have theirs. The\r\nmore aged men, the fathers of the players, and the wealthy citizens,\r\ncome on horseback to see the contests of the young men, with whom, after\r\ntheir manner, they participate, their natural heat seeming to be aroused\r\nby the sight of so much agility, and by their participation in the\r\namusements of unrestrained youth. Every Sunday in Lent, after dinner, a\r\ncompany of young men enter the fields, mounted on warlike horses--\r\n\r\n    “On coursers always foremost in the race;”\r\n\r\nof which\r\n\r\n    “Each steed’s well-train’d to gallop in a ring.”\r\n\r\nThe lay-sons of the citizens rush out of the gates in crowds, equipped\r\nwith lances and shields, the younger sort with pikes from which the\r\niron head has been taken off, and there they get up sham fights, and\r\nexercise themselves in military combat. When the king happens to be near\r\nthe city, most of the courtiers attend, and the young men who form the\r\nhouseholds of the earls and barons, and have not yet attained the honour\r\nof knighthood, resort thither for the purpose of trying their skill. The\r\nhope of victory animates every one. The spirited horses neigh, their\r\nlimbs tremble, they champ their bits, and, impatient of delay, cannot\r\nendure standing still. When at length\r\n\r\n    “The charger’s hoof seizes upon the course,”\r\n\r\nthe young riders having been divided into companies, some pursue those\r\nthat go before without being able to overtake them, whilst others throw\r\ntheir companions out of their course, and gallop beyond them. In the\r\nEaster holidays they play at a game resembling a naval engagement. A\r\ntarget is firmly fastened to the trunk of a tree which is fixed in the\r\nmiddle of the river, and in the prow of a boat driven along by oars and\r\nthe current stands a young man who is to strike the target with his\r\nlance; if, in hitting it, he break his lance, and keep his position\r\nunmoved, he gains his point, and attains his desire: but if his lance\r\nbe not shivered by the blow, he is tumbled into the river, and his boat\r\npasses by, driven along by its own motion. Two boats, however, are\r\nplaced there, one on each side of the target, and in them a number of\r\nyoung men to take up the striker, when he first emerges from the stream,\r\nor when\r\n\r\n    “A second time he rises from the wave.”\r\n\r\nOn the bridge, and in balconies on the banks of the river, stand the\r\nspectators,\r\n\r\n    “well disposed to laugh.”\r\n\r\nDuring the holydays in summer the young men exercise themselves in\r\nthe sports of leaping, archery, wrestling, stone-throwing, slinging\r\njavelins beyond a mark, and also fighting with bucklers. Cytherea leads\r\nthe dances of the maidens, who merrily trip along the ground beneath\r\nthe uprisen moon. Almost on every holyday in winter, before dinner,\r\nfoaming boars, and huge-tusked hogs, intended for bacon, fight for\r\ntheir lives, or fat bulls or immense boars are baited with dogs. When\r\nthat great marsh which washes the walls of the city on the north side\r\nis frozen over, the young men go out in crowds to divert themselves\r\nupon the ice. Some, having increased their velocity by a run, placing\r\ntheir feet apart, and turning their bodies sideways, slide a great way:\r\nothers make a seat of large pieces of ice like mill-stones, and a great\r\nnumber of them running before, and holding each other by the hand, draw\r\none of their companions who is seated on the ice: if at any time they\r\nslip in moving so swiftly, all fall down headlong together. Others are\r\nmore expert in their sports upon the ice; for fitting to, and binding\r\nunder their feet the shinbones of some animal, and taking in their hands\r\npoles shod with iron, which at times they strike against the ice, they\r\nare carried along with as great rapidity as a bird flying or a bolt\r\ndischarged from a cross-bow. Sometimes two of the skaters having placed\r\nthemselves a great distance apart by mutual agreement, come together\r\nfrom opposite sides; they meet, raise their poles, and strike each\r\nother; either one or both of them fall, not without some bodily hurt:\r\neven after their fall they are carried along to a great distance from\r\neach other by the velocity of the motion; and whatever part of their\r\nheads comes in contact with the ice is laid bare to the very skull. Very\r\nfrequently the leg or arm of the falling party, if he chance to light\r\nupon either of them, is broken. But youth is an age eager for glory and\r\ndesirous of victory, and so young men engage in counterfeit battles,\r\nthat they may conduct themselves more valiantly in real ones. Most of\r\nthe citizens amuse themselves in sporting with merlins, hawks, and other\r\nbirds of a like kind, and also with dogs that hunt in the woods. The\r\ncitizens have the right of hunting in Middlesex, Hertfordshire, all\r\nthe Chilterns, and Kent, as far as the river Cray. The Londoners, then\r\ncalled Trinovantes, repulsed Caius Julius Cæsar, a man who delighted to\r\nmark his path with blood. Whence Lucan says,\r\n\r\n    “Britain he sought, but turn’d his back dismay’d.”\r\n\r\nThe city of London has produced some men, who have subdued many\r\nkingdoms, and even the Roman empire; and very many others, whose virtue\r\nhas exalted them to the skies, as was promised to Brutus by the oracle\r\nof Apollo:\r\n\r\n    “Brutus, there lies beyond the Gallic bounds\r\n    An island which the western sea surrounds:\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    To reach this happy shore thy sails employ:\r\n    There fate decrees to raise a second Troy,\r\n    And found an empire in thy royal line\r\n    Which time shall ne’er destroy, nor bounds confine.”\r\n\r\nSince the planting of the Christian religion there, London has given\r\nbirth to the noble emperor Constantine, who gave the city of Rome and\r\nall the insignia of the empire to God and St. Peter, and Pope Sylvester,\r\nwhose stirrup he held, and chose rather to be called defender of the\r\nholy Roman church, than emperor: and that the peace of our lord the\r\nPope might not, by reason of his presence, be disturbed by the turmoils\r\nconsequent on secular business, he withdrew from the city which he had\r\nbestowed upon our lord the Pope, and built for himself the city of\r\nByzantium. London also in modern times has produced illustrious and\r\naugust princes, the empress Matilda, King Henry the Third, and St.\r\nThomas, the archbishop and glorious martyr of Christ, than whom no
