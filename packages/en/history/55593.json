In 1859\r\nthe author of the present work was intrusted, by the Secretary of\r\nState for India in Council, with the duty of superintending all the\r\nnecessary arrangements for the collection of Chinchona-plants and seeds\r\nof the species esteemed in commerce, in South America, and for their\r\nintroduction into India. This important measure has now been crowned\r\nwith complete success, and it is the object of the following pages\r\nto relate the previous history of the Chinchona-plant; to describe\r\nthe forests in South America where the most valuable species grow; to\r\nrecord the labours of those who were engaged in exploring them; and to\r\ngive an account of all the proceedings connected with the cultivation\r\nof Chinchona-plants in India.\r\n\r\nIn the performance of this service it was a part of my duty to explore\r\nthe forests of the Peruvian province of Caravaya, which has never yet\r\nbeen described by any English traveller; and the first part of the work\r\nis occupied by an account of the various species of Chinchona-plants\r\nand their previous history, a narrative of my travels in Peru, and a\r\nrecord of the labours of the agents whom I employed to collect plants\r\nand seeds of the various species of Chinchonæ in other parts of South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThe traveller who ascends to the lofty plateau of the Cordilleras\r\ncannot fail to be deeply interested in the former history and\r\nmelancholy fate of the Peruvian Indians; and some account of their\r\ncondition under Spanish colonial rule, and of the insurrection of\r\nTupac Amaru, the last of the Incas, will, I trust, not be unwelcome.\r\nI have devoted three chapters to these subjects, which will form a\r\nshort digression on our way to the Chinchona forests. I am indebted\r\nto the late General Miller, and to Dr. Vigil, the learned Director of\r\nthe National Library at Lima, for much new and very curious material\r\nthrowing light on that period of Spanish colonial history which\r\nincludes the great rebellion of the Peruvian Indians in 1780.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the work contains a narrative of my travels in\r\nIndia, a description of the sites selected for Chinchona-plantations,\r\nand an account of the progress of the experimental cultivation of those\r\ninestimable trees, from the arrival of the plants and seeds, early in\r\n1861, to the latest dates.\r\n\r\nIn conducting the operations connected with the collection of\r\nChinchona-plants and seeds in South America, I obtained the services\r\nof Mr. Spruce, Mr. Pritchett, Mr. Cross, and Mr. Weir; and it affords\r\nme great pleasure to have this opportunity of publicly recording their\r\nperseverance in facing many dangers and hardships, and in doing the\r\nwork that was allotted to them so ably, and with such complete success.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Richard Spruce, an eminent botanist who has for eight years\r\nbeen engaged in exploring the basin of the Amazons, from Para to the\r\npeaks of the Quitenian Andes, and from the falls of the Orinoco to the\r\nhead-waters of the Huallaga, the largest share of credit, so far as\r\nthe South American portion of the enterprise is concerned, undoubtedly\r\nbelongs. I have endeavoured to do justice to his untiring energy and\r\nzeal, and to the important service which he has rendered to India.\r\n\r\nBut the collection of plants and seeds in South America, and their\r\nconveyance to the shores of India, would have been of little use if\r\nthey had not been delivered into competent hands on arriving at their\r\ndestination. To the scientific and practical knowledge, the unwearied\r\nzeal, and skilful management of Mr. McIvor, the Superintendent of the\r\nGovernment Gardens at Ootacamund, on the Neilgherry hills, is therefore\r\ndue the successful introduction of Chinchona-plants into India. His\r\ncare has now been fully rewarded, and the experiment has reached a\r\npoint which places it beyond the possibility of ultimate failure.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to Sir William Hooker, who has, from the first, taken a\r\ndeep interest in this beneficial measure, for many acts of kindness,\r\nand for his readiness to give me valuable advice and assistance; while\r\nhe has rendered most essential service in successfully raising a large\r\nnumber of Chinchona-plants at Kew. To Dr. Weddell my thanks are due\r\nfor much information most promptly and kindly supplied; and to Mr.\r\nHoward for the important suggestions and information with which he\r\nhas frequently favoured me, and which no scientific man in Europe is\r\nbetter able to give. It is a fortunate circumstance that his invaluable\r\nand superbly illustrated work on the Chinchona genus should have been\r\npublished just at the time when the Chinchonæ are about to be planted\r\nout in India and Ceylon, for from no other source could the cultivators\r\nderive so large an amount of valuable information. Mr. Howard has\r\nlikewise done good service by presenting the Indian Government with\r\na fine healthy plant of _Chinchona Uritusinga_, a species which had\r\nnot previously been introduced. I take this opportunity of expressing\r\nmy thanks for much assistance from Dr. Seemann, the able Editor of\r\nthe 'Bonplandia;' from Mr. Dalzell, the Conservator of Forests in\r\nthe Bombay Presidency; from Dr. Forbes Watson, the Reporter on the\r\nvegetable products of India, at the India Office; from Mr. Veitch, of\r\nthe Royal Exotic Nursery at Chelsea; and from many kind friends both\r\nin Peru and India. I am also indebted to Mr. Alexander Smith, son of\r\nMr. John Smith, the Curator of the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, for\r\nan interesting note on the principal plants employed by the natives of\r\nIndia on account of their real or supposed febrifugal virtues, which\r\nwill be found in an Appendix.\r\n\r\nThe botanical name for the plants which yield Peruvian bark was given\r\nby Linnæus, in honour of the Countess of Chinchon, who was one of the\r\nfirst Europeans cured by this priceless febrifuge. The word has been\r\ngenerally, but most erroneously, spelt _Cinchona_; and, considering\r\nthat such mis-spelling is no mark of respect to the lady whose memory\r\nit is intended to preserve, while it defeats the intention of Linnæus\r\nto do her honour, I have followed the good example of Mr. Howard and\r\nthe Spanish botanists in adopting the correct way of spelling the\r\nword--_Chinchona_.[1] The Counts of Chinchon, the hereditary Alcaides\r\nof the Alcazar of Segovia, do not hold so obscure a place in history as\r\nto excuse the continuance of this mis-spelling of their name.\r\n\r\nAfter much anxiety, extending over a period of three years; after all\r\nthe hardships, dangers, and toils which a search in virgin tropical\r\nforests entails; and after more than one disappointment, it is a\r\nsource of gratification and thankfulness that this great and important\r\nmeasure, fraught with blessings to the people of India, and with no\r\nless beneficial results to the whole civilized world, should have been\r\nfinally attended with complete success, in spite of difficulties of no\r\nordinary character. How complete this success has been, will be seen\r\nby a perusal of the two last chapters of the present work, and of Mr.\r\nMcIvor's very interesting Report in the Appendix; it is sufficient here\r\nto say that it has exceeded our most sanguine expectations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                          TRAVELS IN PERU.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    PREFACE                                                  PAGE V\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                     DISCOVERY OF PERUVIAN BARK.\r\n\r\n    The Countess of Chinchon--Introduction of the use of bark into\r\n    Europe--M.

La Condamine's first description of a _Chinchona_-tree--J.\r\n  de Jussieu--Description of the Chinchona region--The different\r\n  valuable species--The discovery of quinine.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE whole world, and especially all tropical countries where\r\nintermittent fevers prevail, have long been indebted to the mountainous\r\nforests of the Andes for that inestimable febrifuge which has now\r\nbecome indispensable, and the demand for which is rapidly increasing,\r\nwhile the supply decreases, throughout all civilized countries. There\r\nis probably no drug which is more valuable to man than the febrifugal\r\nalkaloid which is extracted from the chinchona-trees of South America;\r\nand few greater blessings could be conferred on the human race than the\r\nnaturalization of these trees in India, and other congenial regions, so\r\nas to render the supply more certain, cheaper, and more abundant.\r\n\r\nIt will be the principal object of the following pages to relate the\r\nmeasures which have been adopted within the last two years to collect\r\nplants and seeds of these quinine-yielding chinchonæ, in the various\r\nregions of South America, where the most valuable species are found;\r\nand to give an account of their introduction into India, and of the\r\nhill districts in that country where it is considered most likely that\r\nthey will thrive. But it is necessary that the reader should have a\r\ngeneral knowledge of these precious trees, and of their history, before\r\nhe accompanies the explorers who were sent in search of them over the\r\ncordilleras of the Andes, and into the vast untrodden forests.\r\n\r\nIt would be strange indeed, if, as is generally supposed, the Indian\r\naborigines of South America were ignorant of the virtues of Peruvian\r\nbark; yet the absence of this sovereign remedy in the wallets of\r\nitinerant native doctors who have plied their trade from father to son,\r\nsince the time of the Incas, certainly gives some countenance to this\r\nidea. It seems probable, nevertheless, that the Indians were aware of\r\nthe virtues of Peruvian bark in the neighbourhood of Loxa, 230 miles\r\nsouth of Quito, where its use was first made known to Europeans: and\r\nthe Indian name for the tree _quina-quina_, \"bark of bark,\" indicates\r\nthat it was believed to possess some special medicinal properties.[3]\r\nThe Indians looked upon their conquerors with dislike and suspicion;\r\nit is improbable that they would be quick to impart knowledge of this\r\nnature to them; and the interval which elapsed between the discovery\r\nand settlement of the country and the first use of Peruvian bark by\r\nEuropeans may thus easily be explained.[4] The conquest and subsequent\r\ncivil wars in Peru cannot be said to have been finally concluded until\r\nthe time of the viceroy Marquis of Cañete, in 1560; and J. de Jussieu\r\nreports that a Jesuit, who had a fever at Malacotas,[5] was cured by\r\nPeruvian bark in 1600. M. La Condamine also found a manuscript in the\r\nlibrary of a convent at Loxa, in which it was stated that the Europeans\r\nof the province used the bark at about the same time. Thus an interval\r\nof only forty years intervened between the pacification of Peru and the\r\ndiscovery of its most valuable product.\r\n\r\nIt may be added, however, that though the Indians were aware of the\r\nfebrifugal qualities of this bark, they attached little importance\r\nto them, and this may be another reason for the lapse of time which\r\noccurred before the knowledge was imparted to the Spaniards. Referring\r\nto this circumstance La Condamine says, \"Nul n'est saint dans son\r\npays.\" This indifference to, and in many cases even prejudice against\r\nthe use of the Peruvian bark, amongst the Indians, is very remarkable.\r\nPoeppig, writing in 1830, says that in the Peruvian province of Huanuco\r\nthe people, who are much subject to tertian agues, have a strong\r\nrepugnance to its use. The Indian thinks that the cold north alone\r\npermits the use of fever-bark; he considers it as very heating, and\r\ntherefore an unfit remedy in complaints which he believes to arise from\r\ninflammation of the blood.[6] Humboldt also notices this repugnance\r\nto using the bark amongst the natives; and Mr. Spruce makes the same\r\nobservation with respect to the people of Ecuador and New Granada.[7]\r\nHe says that they refer all diseases to the influence of either heat\r\nor cold; and, confounding cause and effect, they suppose all fevers to\r\nproceed from heat. They justly believe bark to be very heating, and\r\nhence their prejudice against its use in fevers, which they treat with\r\n_frescos_ or cooling drinks. Even in Guayaquil the prejudice against\r\nquinine is so strong that, when a physician administers it, he is\r\nobliged to call it by another name.\r\n\r\nIn about 1630 Don Juan Lopez de Canizares, the Spanish Corregidor of\r\nLoxa, being ill with an intermittent fever, an Indian of Malacotas is\r\nsaid to have revealed to him the healing virtues of quinquina bark,\r\nand to have instructed him in the proper way to administer it, and thus\r\nhis cure was effected.\r\n\r\nIn 1638 the wife of Luis Geronimo Fernandez de Cabrera Bobadilla\r\ny Mendoza, fourth Count of Chinchon, lay sick of an intermittent\r\nfever in the palace at Lima. Her famous cure induced Linnæus, long\r\nafterwards, to name the whole genus of quinine-yielding trees in her\r\nhonour _chinchona_. The godmother of these priceless treasures of the\r\nvegetable kingdom has, therefore, some claim upon our attention.\r\n\r\nThis Countess of Chinchon was a daughter of the noble house of Osorio,\r\nwhose founder was created Marquis of Astorga by Henry IV., King of\r\nCastille. The eighth marquis, who died at Astorga in 1613, had a\r\ndaughter by his wife Dona Blanca Manrique y Aragon, named Ana,[8]\r\nborn in 1576; and the ruins of the palace in the curious old town of\r\nAstorga, in which she passed her childhood, are still standing.[9]\r\nAt the early age of sixteen she was married to Don Luis de Velasco,\r\nMarquis of Salinas, who was about to assume the important office of\r\nviceroy of Mexico. She probably accompanied her husband to Mexico, and\r\nafterwards to Lima, as he was viceroy of Peru from 1596 to 1604. In the\r\nlatter year he resumed his former office in Mexico, and, on his return\r\nto Spain, he became President of the Council of the Indies from 1611 to\r\n1617.[10] The lady Ana had thus been a great traveller, when, in the\r\nlatter year, she found herself a widow. In 1621 she was married, in the\r\ncity of Madrid, to her second husband the fourth Count of Chinchon,\r\nwho was descended from a long line of proud and valiant Catalonian\r\nancestors. One of his forefathers, Don Andres de Cabrera, who was\r\ncreated Marquis of Moya in 1480, married Beatriz de Bobadilla, so well\r\nknown in history as the faithful attendant and confidential friend of\r\nQueen Isabella the Catholic. The Emperor Charles V., remembering the\r\nservices and ancient dignity of the illustrious families of Cabrera and\r\nBobadilla, created the second son of the Marquis of Moya, by Beatriz\r\nde Bobadilla, Count of his town of Chinchon, in the kingdom of Toledo,\r\nin 1517.[11] The third Count was one of the over-worked ministers\r\nof that most indefatigable of \"red-tapists\" Philip II.; and his son\r\nbecame the husband of the widow Ana, who accompanied him to Lima on his\r\nappointment as viceroy of Peru in 1629. Thus, for the second time, this\r\nlady entered the City of the Kings as Vice-Queen.\r\n\r\nWhile the Countess Ana was suffering from fever in 1638, in her\r\nsixty-third year, the Corregidor of Loxa, Don Juan Lopez de Canizares,\r\nsent a parcel of powdered quinquina bark to her physician, Juan de\r\nVega, who was also captain of the armoury, assuring him that it was a\r\nsovereign and never-failing remedy for \"tertiana.\" It was administered\r\nto the Countess and effected a complete cure; and Mr. Howard is\r\nof opinion that the particular plant which had this honour, and\r\nwhich, therefore, yields the true and original Peruvian bark, is the\r\n_Chahuarguera_ variety of the _C. Condaminea_.[12] This kind contains a\r\nlarge percentage of _chinchonidine_, an alkaloid, the great importance\r\nof which is only now just beginning to be recognised, so that it is\r\nto _chinchonidine_, and not to _quinine_, that the Countess's cure is\r\ndue.[13]\r\n\r\nThe Count of Chinchon returned to Spain in 1640, and his Countess,\r\nbringing with her a quantity of the healing bark, was thus the first\r\nperson to introduce this invaluable medicine into Europe.[14] Hence\r\nit was sometimes called Countess's bark, and Countess's powder. Her\r\nphysician, Juan de Vega, sold it at Seville for one hundred reals the\r\npound. In memory of this great service Linnæus named the genus which\r\nyields it _Chinchona_, and afterwards the lady Ana's name was still\r\nfurther immortalized in the great family of _Chinchonaceæ_, which,\r\ntogether with _Chinchonæ_, includes ipecacuanhas and coffees. By modern\r\nwriters the first _h_ has usually been dropped, and the word is now\r\nalmost invariably, but most erroneously, spelt _Cinchona_.\r\n\r\nAfter the cure of the Countess of Chinchon, the Jesuits were the\r\ngreat promoters of the introduction of bark into Europe. In 1639, as\r\nthe last act of his viceroyalty, her husband did good service to the\r\ncause of geographical discovery, by causing the expedition under the\r\nPortuguese Texeira to proceed from Quito to the mouth of the Amazons,\r\naccompanied by the Jesuit Acuña, who wrote a most valuable account of\r\nthe voyage.[15] From that time the missionaries of Acuña's fraternity\r\ncontinued to penetrate into the forests bordering on the upper waters\r\nof the Amazons, and to form settlements; and Humboldt mentions a\r\ntradition that these Jesuits accidentally discovered the bitterness\r\nof the bark, and tried an infusion of it in tertian ague. In 1670 the\r\nJesuit missionaries sent parcels of the powdered bark to Rome, whence\r\nit was distributed to members of the fraternity throughout Europe\r\nby the Cardinal de Lugo, and used for the cure of agues with great\r\nsuccess. Hence the name of \"Jesuits' bark,\" and \"Cardinal's bark;\" and\r\nit was a ludicrous result of its patronage by the Jesuits that its use\r\nshould have been for a long time opposed by Protestants and favoured\r\nby Roman Catholics. In 1679 Louis XIV. bought the secret of preparing\r\nquinquina from Sir Robert Talbor, an English doctor, for two thousand\r\nlouis-d'ors, a large pension, and a title. From that time Peruvian\r\nbark seems to have been recognised as the most efficacious remedy for\r\nintermittent fevers. The second Lord Shaftesbury, who died in 1699,\r\nmentions in one of his letters--\"Dr. Locke's and all our ingenious and\r\nable doctors' method of treating fevers with the Peruvian bark:\" he\r\ndeclares his belief that it is \"the most innocent and effectual of all\r\nmedicines;\" but he also alludes to \"the bugbear the world makes of it,\r\nespecially the tribe of inferior physicians.\"\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that a very strong prejudice was raised against\r\nit, which it took many years to conquer; and the controversies which\r\narose on the subject between learned doctors were long and acrimonious.\r\nDr. Colmenero, a professor of the University of Salamanca, wrote a\r\nwork in which he declared that ninety sudden deaths had been caused by\r\nits use in Madrid alone.[16] Chiflet (Paris, 1653) and Plempius (Rome,\r\n1656), two great enemies of novelty, prophesied the early death of\r\nquinquina, and its inevitable malediction by future ages; while the\r\nmore enlightened Badius (Genoa, 1656) defended its use, and quoted more\r\nthan twelve thousand cures by the aid of this remedy, performed by the\r\nbest doctors of the hospitals in Italy. In 1692 Dr. Morton, one of the\r\nopponents of its use, was obliged to retract all he had said against\r\nquinquina; and it was then that it began to be generally admitted\r\nas a valuable medicine. It still, however, remained a subject of\r\ncontroversy, and as late as 1714 two Italian physicians, Ramazzini and\r\nTorti,[17] held opposite views on the subject. Ramazzini wrote against\r\nits use with much violence, while Torti maintained that, in proper\r\ndoses, it would arrest remittent and intermittent fevers.[18]\r\n\r\nWhilst the inestimable value of Peruvian bark was gradually forcing\r\nconviction on the most bigoted medical conservatives of Europe, and\r\nwhilst the number and efficacy of cures effected by its means were\r\nbringing it into general use, and consequently increasing the demand,\r\nit was long before any knowledge was obtained of the tree from which it\r\nwas taken. In 1726 La Fontaine, at the solicitation of the Duchess of\r\nBouillon, who had been cured of a dangerous fever by taking Peruvian\r\nbark, composed a poem in two cantos to celebrate its virtues; but the\r\nexquisite beauty of the leaves, and the delicious fragrance of the\r\nflowers of the quinquina-tree, with allusions to which he might have\r\nadorned his poem, were still unknown in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe first description of the quinquina-tree is due to that memorable\r\nFrench expedition to South America, to which all branches of science\r\nowe so much. The members of this expedition, MM. De la Condamine,\r\nGodin, Bouguer, and the botanist Joseph de Jussieu, sailed from\r\nRochelle on the 16th of May, 1735, to measure the arc of a degree near\r\nQuito, and thus determine the shape of the earth. After a residence\r\nat Quito, Jussieu set out for Loxa, to examine the quinquina-tree, in\r\nMarch, 1739, and in 1743 La Condamine visited Loxa, and stayed for some\r\ntime at Malacotas, with a Spaniard whose chief source of income was the\r\ncollection of bark. He obtained some young plants with the intention of\r\ntaking them down the river Amazons to Cayenne, and thence transporting\r\nthem to the Jardin des Plantes at Paris; but a wave washed over his\r\nlittle vessel near Para, at the mouth of the great river, and carried\r\noff the box in which he had preserved these plants for more than eight\r\nmonths. \"Thus,\" he says, \"I lost them after all the care I had taken\r\nduring a voyage of more than twelve hundred leagues.\"[19] This was the\r\nfirst attempt to transport chinchona-plants from their native forests.\r\n\r\nCondamine described the quinquina-tree of Loxa in the 'Mémoires de\r\nl'Académie;'[20] he was the first man of science who examined and\r\ndescribed this important plant; and in 1742 Linnæus established the\r\ngenus CHINCHONA, in honour of the Countess Ana of Chinchon. He,\r\nhowever, only knew of two species, that of Loxa, which was named _C.\r\nofficinalis_, and the _C. Caribæa_, since degraded to the medicinally\r\nworthless genus of _Exostemmas_.\r\n\r\nJoseph de Jussieu, whose name is associated with that of La Condamine\r\nin the first examination of the chinchona-trees of Loxa, continued his\r\nresearches in South America after the departure of his associate. He\r\npenetrated on foot into the province of Canelos, the scene of Gonzalo\r\nPizarro's wonderful achievements and terrible sufferings; he visited\r\nLima with M. Godin; he travelled over Upper Peru as far as the forests\r\nof Santa Cruz de la Sierra; and he was the first botanist who examined\r\nand sent home specimens of the coca-plant, the beloved narcotic of the\r\nPeruvian Indian. After fifteen years of laborious work he was robbed\r\nof his large collection of plants by a servant at Buenos Ayres, who\r\nbelieved that the boxes contained money. This loss had a disastrous\r\neffect on poor Jussieu, who, in 1771, returned to France, deprived of\r\nreason, after an absence of thirty-four years. Dr. Weddell has named\r\nthe shrubby variety of _C. Calisaya_ in honour of this unfortunate\r\nbotanist _C. Josephiana_.\r\n\r\nFor many years the quinquina-tree of Loxa, the _C. officinalis_ of\r\nLinnæus, was the only species with which botanists were acquainted;\r\nand from 1640 to 1776 no other bark was met with in commerce than that\r\nwhich was exported from the Peruvian port of Payta, brought down from\r\nthe forests in the neighbourhood of Loxa. The constant practice of\r\nimprovidently felling the trees over so small an area for more than a\r\ncentury, without any cessation, inevitably led to their becoming very\r\nscarce, and threatened their eventual extinction. As early as 1735\r\nUlloa reported to the Spanish Government, that the habit of cutting\r\ndown the trees in the forests of Loxa, and afterwards barking them,\r\nwithout taking the precaution of planting others in their places, would\r\nundoubtedly cause their complete extirpation. \"Though the trees are\r\nnumerous,\" he added, \"yet they have an end;\" and he suggested that the\r\nCorregidor of Loxa should be directed to appoint an overseer, whose\r\nduty it should be to examine the forests, and satisfy himself that a\r\ntree was planted in place of every one that was felled, on pain of a\r\nfine.[21] This wise rule was never enforced, and sixty years afterwards\r\nHumboldt reported that 25,000 trees were destroyed in one year.\r\n\r\nThe measures adopted by the Spanish Government towards the end of the\r\nlast century, in sending botanical expeditions to explore the chinchona\r\nforests in other parts of their vast South American possessions, led to\r\nthe discovery of additional valuable species, the introduction of their\r\nbarks into commerce, and the reduction of the pressure on the Loxa\r\nforests, which were thus relieved from being the sole source whence\r\nPeruvian bark could be supplied to the world.\r\n\r\nThe region of chinchona-trees extends from 19° S. latitude, where\r\nWeddell found the _C. Australis_, to 10° N., following the almost\r\nsemicircular curve of the cordillera of the Andes over 1740 miles of\r\nlatitude. They flourish in a cool and equable temperature, on the\r\nslopes and in the valleys and ravines of the mountains, surrounded\r\nby the most majestic scenery, never descending below an elevation of\r\n2500, and ascending as high as 9000 feet above the sea. Within these\r\nlimits their usual companions are tree ferns, melastomaceæ, arborescent\r\npassion-flowers, and allied genera of chinchonaceous plants. Below them\r\nare the forests abounding in palms and bamboos, above their highest\r\nlimits are a few lowly Alpine shrubs. But within this wide zone grow\r\nmany species of chinchonæ, each within its own narrower belt as regards\r\nelevation above the sea, some yielding the inestimable bark, and others\r\ncommercially worthless. And the species of chinchonæ, in their native\r\nforests, are not only divided from each other by zones as regards\r\nheight above the sea, but also by parallels of latitude. In Bolivia\r\nand Caravaya, for instance, the valuable _C. Calisaya_ abounds, but it\r\nis never found nearer the equator than 12° S. Between that parallel\r\nand 10° S. the forests are for the most part occupied by worthless\r\nspecies, while in Northern Peru the important grey barks of commerce\r\nare found. In each of these latitudinal regions the different species\r\nare again divided by belts of altitude. Yet this confinement within\r\nzones of latitude and altitude is not a constant rule; for several of\r\nthe hardier and stronger species have a wider range; while the more\r\nsensitive, and these are usually the most precious kinds, are close\r\nprisoners within their allotted zones, and never pass more than a\r\nhundred yards beyond them. All the species are, of course, affected by\r\nlocal circumstances, which more or less modify the positions of their\r\nzones, as regards altitude.\r\n\r\nThus, to give a geographical summary of the chinchona region, beginning\r\nfrom the south, it commences in the Bolivian province of Cochabamba in\r\n19° S., passes through the yungus of La Paz, Larecaja, Caupolican, and\r\nMunecas, into the Peruvian province of Caravaya; thence through the\r\nPeruvian forests, on the eastern slopes of the Andes, of Marcapata,\r\nPaucartambo, Santa Anna, Guanta, and Uchubamba, to Huanuco and\r\nHuamalies, where the grey bark is found. It then continues through\r\nJaen, to the forests near Loxa and Cuenca, and on the western slopes of\r\nChimborazo. It begins again in latitude 1° 51´ N. at Almaguer, passes\r\nthrough the province of Popayan, and along the slopes of the Andes of\r\nQuindiu, until it reaches its extreme northern limit on the wooded\r\nheights of Merida and Santa Martha.\r\n\r\nHumboldt remarks that, beyond these limits, the Silla de Caraccas, and\r\nother mountains in the province of Cumana, possess a suitable altitude\r\nand climate for the growth of chinchona-trees, as well as some parts\r\nof Mexico, yet that they have never been found either in Cumana or\r\nMexico; and he suggests that this may be accounted for by the breaks\r\nwhich take place in Venezuela on the one hand, and on the isthmus of\r\nPanama on the other, where tracts of country of low elevation intervene\r\nbetween the lofty mountains of Cumana and Mexico and the chinchona\r\nregion of the main Andes. In these low districts the chinchona-trees\r\nmay have encountered obstacles which prevented their propagation to\r\nthe northward: otherwise we might expect to find them in the beautiful\r\nMexican woods of Jalapa, whither the soil and climate, and their usual\r\ncompanions the tree ferns and melastomaceæ, would seem to invite\r\nthem.[22]\r\n\r\nBe this how it may, the chinchona-plant has never been found in any\r\npart of the world beyond the limits already described.\r\n\r\nThe chinchonas, when in good soil and under other favourable\r\ncircumstances, become large forest trees; on higher elevations, and\r\nwhen crowded, and growing in rocky ground, they frequently run up to\r\ngreat heights without a branch; and at the upper limit of their zone\r\nthey become mere shrubs. The leaves are of a great variety of shapes\r\nand sizes, but, in most of the finest species, they are lanceolate,\r\nwith a shining surface of bright green, traversed by crimson veins,\r\nand petioles of the same colour. The flowers are very small, but hang\r\nin clustering panicles, like lilacs, generally of a deep roseate\r\ncolour, paler near the stalk, dark crimson within the tube, with white\r\ncurly hairs bordering the laciniæ of the corolla. The flowers of _C.\r\nmicrantha_ are entirely white. They send forth a delicious fragrance\r\nwhich scents the air in their vicinity.\r\n\r\nThe earliest botanists gave the name of Chinchona to a vast number of\r\nallied genera, which have since been separated, and grouped under other\r\nnames.[23] There are three characteristics by which a true chinchona\r\nmay invariably be known; the presence of curly hairs bordering the\r\nlaciniæ of the corolla, the peculiar mode of dehiscence of the capsule\r\nfrom below upwards, and the little pits at the axils of the veins\r\non the under sides of the leaves. These characters distinguish the\r\nchinchona from many trees which grow with it, and which might at\r\nfirst sight be taken for the same genus. The fact, established by the\r\ninvestigations of chemists, that none of these allied genera contain\r\nany of the medicinal alkaloids, has confirmed the propriety of their\r\nexpulsion from the chinchona genus by botanists; and Dr. Weddell gives\r\na list of seventy-three plants, once received as Chinchonæ, which are\r\nnow more properly classed under allied genera, such as _Cosmibuena_,\r\n_Cascarilla_, _Exostemma_, _Remijia_, _Ladenbergia_, _Lasionema_,\r\n&c.[24]\r\n\r\nThus thinned out and reduced in numbers, the list of species of\r\nChinchonæ has been established by Dr. Weddell at nineteen, and two\r\ndoubtful;[25] but even the classification of this eminent authority,\r\npublished in 1849, already requires much alteration and revision. For\r\ninstance: Dr. Weddell gives no place to the \"red-bark\" species, the\r\nrichest in alkaloids, and one of the most important, which, through\r\nthe recent investigations of Mr. Spruce, will now probably be admitted\r\nby botanists as a distinct species, the _C. succirubra_ (Pavon). A new\r\ngrey bark now introduced into India as _C. Peruviana_ (Howard), and\r\nthe _C. Pahudiana_ (Howard), a worthless kind, cultivated by the Dutch\r\nin Java, will also be received as additional species. It seems likely\r\nalso that the _C. Condaminea_ requires to be divided into two or three\r\ndistinct species; while the _C. Boliviana_ (Weddell) will sink into a\r\nmere variety of the _C. Calisaya_.\r\n\r\nThe commercially valuable species, however, comprise but a small\r\nproportion of the whole; and, as all these have now been introduced\r\ninto India, they alone deserve our attention. They are as follows:--\r\n\r\n                    _C. succirubra_   (Pavon)       yielding _Red bark._\r\n                   {_C. Chahuarguera_ (Pavon)  }\r\n  _C. Condaminea._ {_C. crispa_       (Tafalla)}        \"  _Crown bark._\r\n                   {_C. Uritusinga_   (Pavon)  }\r\n                   {_C. lancifolia_   (Mutis)       \" _Carthagena bark._\r\n                    _C. nitida_       (Ruiz & Pavon)}\r\n                    _C. micrantha_    (Ruiz & Pavon)}   \"   _Grey bark._\r\n                    _C. Peruviana_    (Howard)      }\r\n                    _C. Calisaya_     (Weddell)         \" _Yellow bark._\r\n\r\nThese species yield five different kinds of medicinal barks, which\r\nare collected from five different regions in South America; and in\r\nthe following chapter I propose to give a brief account of each of\r\nthese regions, of their chinchona-trees, and of the investigations of\r\nbotanists down to the time when measures were taken to introduce these\r\ninestimable plants into Java and India. Such an account will naturally\r\ndivide itself into five sections:--\r\n\r\n    I.--The Loxa region, and its _crown barks_.\r\n   II.--The _red-bark_ region, on the western slopes of Chimborazo.\r\n  III.--The New Granada region.\r\n   IV.--The Huanuco region in Northern Peru, and its _grey barks_.\r\n    V.--The _Calisaya_ region, in Bolivia and Southern Peru.\r\n\r\nBefore entering on this subject, however, it will be well to cast a\r\nhasty glance at the progress of those investigations which ended in the\r\ndiscovery of the febrifugal principle in Peruvian bark.\r\n\r\nThe roots, flowers, and capsules of the chinchona-trees have a bitter\r\ntaste with tonic properties, but the upper bark is the only part which\r\nhas any commercial value.[26] The bark of trees is composed of four\r\nlayers--the epiderm, the periderm, the cellular layer, and the liber or\r\nfibrous layer, composed of hexagonal cells filled with resinous matter\r\nand woody tissue. In growing, the tree pushes out the bark, and, as the\r\nexterior part ceases to grow, it separates into layers, and forms the\r\ndead part or periderm; which in chinchonas is partially destroyed, and\r\nblended with the thallus of lichens. The bark is thus formed of the\r\ndead part, or periderm, and the living part, or derm. On young branches\r\nthere is no dead part, the exterior layers remaining entire, while\r\nthe inner layers have not had time to develop. In thick old branches,\r\non the contrary, the periderm or dead part is considerable, while the\r\nfibrous layer of the derm is fully developed. In preparing the bark\r\nthe periderm is removed by striking the trunk with a mallet, and the\r\nderm is then taken off by uniform incisions. The thin pieces from small\r\nbranches are simply exposed to the sun's rays, and assume the form of\r\nhollow cylinders, or quills, called by the natives _canuto_ bark. The\r\nsolid trunk bark is called _tabla_ or _plancha_, and is sewn up in\r\ncoarse canvas and an outer envelope of fresh hide, forming the packages\r\ncalled _serons_.\r\n\r\nThe character of the transverse fracture affords an important criterion\r\nof the quality of the bark. Cellular tissue breaks with a short and\r\nsmooth fracture, woody tissue with a fibrous fracture, as is the case\r\nwith the _calisaya_ bark. The best characteristics by which barks\r\ncontaining much quinine may be distinguished are the shortness of the\r\nfibres which cover the transverse fracture, and the facility with which\r\nthey may be detached, instead of being flexible and adhering as in bad\r\nbarks. Thus, when dry _calisaya_ bark is handled, a quantity of little\r\nprickles run into the skin, and this forms one of its distinguishing\r\nmarks.[27]\r\n\r\nUntil the present century Peruvian bark was used in its crude state,\r\nand numerous attempts were made at different times to discover the\r\nactual healing principle in the bark, before success was finally\r\nattained. The first trial which is worthy of attention was made in\r\n1779 by the chemists Buguet and Cornette, who recognised the existence\r\nof an essential salt, a resinous and an earthy matter in quinquina\r\nbark. In 1790 Fourcroy discovered the existence of a colouring matter,\r\nafterwards called _chinchona red_, and a Swedish doctor named Westring,\r\nin 1800, believed that he had discovered the active principle in\r\nquinquina bark. In 1802 the French chemist Armand Seguin undertook\r\nthe bark trade on a large scale, and found it necessary to study\r\nthe means of discovering good barks, and distinguishing them from\r\nbad ones. He found that the best quinquina bark was precipitated by\r\ntannin, while the bad was not precipitated by that substance. In 1803\r\nanother chemist found a crystalline substance in the bark which he\r\ncalled \"_sel essentiel fébrifuge_\" but it was nothing more than the\r\ncombination of lime with an acid which was named _quinic acid_. Reuss,\r\na Russian chemist, in 1815, was the first to give a tolerable analysis\r\nof quinquina bark; and about the same time Dr. Duncan of Edinburgh\r\nsuggested that a real substance existed as a febrifugal principle.\r\nDr. Gomez, a surgeon in the Portuguese navy, in 1816, was the first\r\nto isolate this febrifugal principle hinted at by Dr. Duncan, and he\r\ncalled it _chinchonine_.[28]\r\n\r\nBut the final discovery of quinine is due to the French chemists\r\nPelletier and Caventou, in 1820. They considered that a vegetable\r\nalkaloid, analogous to morphine and strychnine, existed in quinquina\r\nbark; and they afterwards discovered that the febrifugal principle was\r\nseated in two alkaloids, separate or together, in the different kinds\r\nof bark, called _quinine_ and _chinchonine_, with the same virtues,\r\nwhich, however, were much more powerful in quinine. It was believed\r\nthat in most barks chinchonine exists in the cellular layer, and\r\nquinine in the liber, or fibrous layer; but Mr. Howard has since shown\r\nthat this view is quite incorrect.[29] In 1829 Pelletier discovered a\r\nthird alkaloid, which he called _aricine_, of no use in medicine, and\r\nderived from a worthless species of chinchona, growing in most of the\r\nforests of Peru, called _C. pubescens_.[30]\r\n\r\nThe organic constituents of chinchona barks are--\r\n\r\n  Quina.              |     Kinovic acid.\r\n  Chinchonia.         |     Chinchona red.\r\n  Aricina.            |     A yellow colouring matter.\r\n  Quinidia.           |     A green fatty matter.\r\n  Chinchonidia.       |     Starch.\r\n  Quinic acid.        |     Gum.\r\n  Tannic acid.        |     Lignin.\r\n\r\nThese materials are in different proportions according to the barks.\r\nGrey bark chiefly contains chinchonine and tannin; Calisaya, or yellow\r\nbark, much quinine, and a little chinchonine; red bark holds quinine\r\nand chinchonine in nearly equal proportions; while the barks of New\r\nGranada chiefly contain chinchonidine and quinidine. The two latter\r\nalkaloids were definitively discovered in 1852 by M. Pasteur; although\r\nthe Dutch chemist Heijningen had, in 1848, found what he called β\r\nquinine or quinidine. Chinchonidine is only second to quinine itself in\r\nimportance as a febrifugal principle.\r\n\r\n_Quinine_ is a white substance, without smell, bitter, fusible,\r\ncrystallized, with the property of left-handed rotatory polarization.\r\nThe salts of quinine are soluble in water, alcohol, and ether. Of\r\nall the salts the bisulphate of quinine is preferred, because it\r\nconstitutes a stable salt, easy to prepare, and containing a strong\r\nproportion of the alkaloid. It is very bitter and soluble, and\r\ncrystallizes in long silky needles. It is prepared by adding sulphuric\r\nacid to the sulphate.[31]\r\n\r\n_Chinchonine_ differs from quinine in being less soluble in water,\r\nand being altogether insoluble in ether. It has the property of\r\nright-handed rotatory polarization.\r\n\r\n_Quinidine_ also has the property of right-handed rotatory\r\npolarization, and forms salts like those of quinine. It becomes green\r\nby successive additions of chlorine and ammonia.\r\n\r\n_Chinchonidine_ has not the property of turning green, and forms a\r\nsulphate almost exactly like sulphate of quinine.[32]\r\n\r\nThe discovery of these alkaloids in the quinquina[33] bark, by enabling\r\nchemists to extract the healing principle, has greatly increased the\r\nusefulness of the drug. In small doses they promote the appetite\r\nand assist digestion; and chinchonine is equal to quinine in mild\r\ncases of intermittent fever; but in severe cases the use of quinine\r\nis absolutely necessary. Thus these alkaloids not only possess\r\ntonic properties to which recourse may be had under a multitude of\r\ncircumstances, but also have a febrifugal virtue which is unequalled,\r\nand which has rendered them almost a necessary of life in tropical\r\ncountries, and in low marshy situations where agues prevail. Many a\r\npoor fellow's life was saved in the Walcheren expedition by the timely\r\narrival of a Yankee trader with some chests of bark, after the supply\r\nhad entirely failed in the camp.[34] Dr. Baikie, in his voyage up the\r\nNiger, attributed the return of his men alive to the habitual use of\r\nquinine; and the number of men whose lives it has saved in our naval\r\nservice and in India will give a notion of the vast importance of a\r\nsufficient and cheap supply of the precious bark which yields it.\r\nIndia and other countries have been vainly searched for a substitute\r\nfor quinine, and we may say with as much truth now as Laubert did in\r\n1820--\"This medicine, the most precious of all those known in the art\r\nof healing, is one of the greatest conquests made by man over the\r\nvegetable kingdom. The treasures which Peru yields, and which the\r\nSpaniards sought and dug out of the bowels of the earth, are not to be\r\ncompared for utility with the bark of the quinquina-tree, which they\r\nfor a long time ignored.[35]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  The valuable species of Chinchona-trees--their history, their\r\n  discoverers, and their forests.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--THE LOXA REGION, AND ITS _CROWN BARKS_.\r\n\r\nTHE region around Loxa, on the southern frontier of the modern republic\r\nof Ecuador, is the original home of the Chinchona, and nearly in the\r\ncentre of its latitudinal range of growth. On the lofty grass-covered\r\nslopes of the Andes, around the little town of Loxa, and in the\r\nsheltered ravines and dense forests, those precious trees were found\r\nwhich first made known to the world the healing virtues of Peruvian\r\nbark. They were most plentifully met with in the forests of Uritusinga,\r\nRumisitana, Cajanuma, Boqueron, Villonaco, and Monje, all within short\r\ndistances of Loxa.\r\n\r\nLinnæus had named these trees _Chinchona officinalis_; but when\r\nHumboldt and Bonpland examined them, the discovery of other species\r\nyielding medicinal bark had rendered the name inappropriate, and they\r\nvery properly re-christened them, after the distinguished Frenchman\r\nwho had originally described them, _Chinchona Condaminea_. Humboldt\r\nsays that they grow on mica slate and gneiss, from 6000 to 8000 feet\r\nabove the sea, with a mean temperature between 60° and 65° Fahr. In\r\nhis time the tree was cut down in its first flowering season, or in\r\nthe fourth or seventh of its age, according as it had sprung from a\r\nvigorous root-shoot, or from a seed. He describes the luxuriance of\r\nthe vegetation to be such that the younger trees, only six inches in\r\ndiameter, often attain from fifty-three to sixty-four English feet in\r\nheight. \"This beautiful tree,\" he continues, \"which is adorned with\r\nleaves above five inches long and two broad, growing in dense forests,\r\nseems always to aspire to rise above its neighbours. As its upper\r\nbranches wave to and fro in the wind, their red and shining foliage\r\nproduces a strange and peculiar effect, recognisable from a great\r\ndistance.\"[36] It varies much in the shape of the leaves, according\r\nto the altitude at which it grows, and bark-collectors themselves\r\nwould be deceived if they did not know the tree by the glands, so long\r\nunobserved by botanists. The _C. Condaminea_ described by Humboldt\r\nis the same as the _C. Uritusinga_ of Pavon. It once yielded great\r\nquantities of thick trunk bark, but, owing to reckless felling through\r\na course of years, it is now almost exterminated, and its bark is\r\nrarely met with in commerce. The distinguished botanist Don Francisco\r\nCaldas examined the chinchona forests of Loxa after Humboldt, between\r\n1803 and 1809. He says that the famous quina-tree of Loxa grows in the\r\nforests of Uritusinga and Cajanuma, at a height of from 6200 to 8200\r\nfeet above the sea, in a temperature of 41° to 72° Fahr.; but that it\r\nis only found between the rivers Zamora and Cachiyacu.[37] He describes\r\nthe tree as from thirty to forty-eight feet high, with three or more\r\nstems growing from the same root; the leaves as lanceolate, shining on\r\nboth sides, with veins a rosy colour, a short and tender pubescence\r\non the under side when young, and when past maturity a bright scarlet\r\ncolour; the bark black when exposed to the sun and wind, a brownish\r\ncolour when closed in by other trees, and always covered with\r\nlichens;[38] and the rock on which the trees grow, a micaceous schist.\r\n\r\nDon Francisco José de Caldas, a native of New Granada, was one of\r\nthe most eminent scientific men that South America has yet produced.\r\nHe was associated with Mutis in the botanical expedition of New\r\nGranada; he explored the chinchona region as far as Loxa; and thus\r\ntakes his place as one of those to whom we are indebted for throwing\r\nlight on the nature of the trees yielding Peruvian bark. Caldas was\r\nborn at Popayan in the year 1770; and, from early youth, devoted\r\nhimself to the pursuits of science with untiring energy, especially\r\nstudying botany, mathematics, meteorology, and physical geography. He\r\nconstructed his own barometer and sextant, and, ignorant of the methods\r\nadopted in Europe, he discovered the way of ascertaining altitudes by\r\na boiling-point thermometer. He has left many memoirs on botanical and\r\nother subjects behind him, and his style is always animated, clear,\r\nand interesting; but many of the productions of this remarkable man\r\nare still in manuscript,[39] and others are lost to us for ever. Above\r\nall, it is to be regretted that his botanical chart of the chinchona\r\ngenus, which he promised in one of his memoirs, has never seen the\r\nlight. After the declaration of independence Caldas was nominated by\r\nthe Congress at Bogota to publish the works of his friend the botanist\r\nMutis. When the brutal Spanish General Morillo entered Bogota in June\r\n1816, he perpetrated a series of savage massacres, in which more than\r\n600 of the most distinguished men in the country fell victims. Among\r\nthem was Caldas, who was shot through the back on the 30th of October\r\n1816.[40]\r\n\r\nThe Spanish botanists Ruiz and Pavon also examined the chinchona-trees\r\nof Loxa; and the latter described two species, _C. Uritusinga_,\r\nnamed from the mountain on which it was once most abundant, and _C.\r\nChahuarguera_, so called from a fancied resemblance of the bark to\r\na pair of breeches (_huara_ in Quichua) made from the fibre of the\r\nAmerican aloe (_chahuar_). To these the botanist Tafalla added the\r\n_C. crispa_. These three species are all included in Humboldt's _C.\r\nCondaminea_, which is readily known by the little pits, bordered\r\nwith hairs, at the axils of the veins on the under side of the leaf.\r\nIt would appear that at one period of growth these little pits or\r\nscrobicules are wanting, but when the plant is in full vigour they are\r\nmarkedly prominent. The _C. Chahuarguera_[41] is described by Pavon as\r\ngrowing from eighteen to twenty-four feet in height; although now the\r\ntrees, which yield the Loxa bark of commerce, do not attain a height\r\nof more than four to nine feet. It is met with on the grassy open\r\ncrests of mountain ridges, in light sandy soil interspersed with rocks,\r\namongst shrubs and young plants. The barks of Loxa were called _crown\r\nbarks_, because they were reserved for the exclusive use of the royal\r\npharmacy at Madrid; and they originally sold at Panama for five and\r\nsix dollars, and at Seville for twelve dollars the pound; but in later\r\ntimes they were much adulterated, and the price fell to one dollar the\r\npound.\r\n\r\nThe _C. Chahuarguera_ is the _rusty crown bark_ of commerce,[42] and\r\nthe _C. crispa_ is the _quina fina de Loxa_ or _crespilla negra_ of the\r\nnatives. A parcel of it has quite recently sold at a higher price than\r\n_Calisaya_ quills. With this _rusty crown bark_ are mixed larger quills\r\nparticularly rich in the alkaloid called chinchonidine.[43] The _C.\r\nUritusinga_ grew to the height of a lofty forest tree, but it is now\r\nnearly exterminated. The leaves assume a red colour before they fall,\r\nacquiring the most beautiful tints, and the tree is one of the finest\r\nin those forests.[44] It is said that there is a great difference in\r\nthe bark, according as it is grown on the sides of mountains most\r\nexposed to the morning or evening sun; and its position is believed to\r\nhave a great influence on the quality of its alkaloids. The usual yield\r\nof the large quills is 3.5 to 3.6 per cent.[45]\r\n\r\nThe bark-collectors of Loxa are said to show some little forethought,\r\na quality which is entirely wanting in most of their fraternity. To\r\nsave the trees they occasionally cut off the whole of the bark, with\r\nthe exception of one long strip, which gradually replaces its loss;\r\nand the second cutting is called _cascarilla resecada_. This practice\r\nwas in use in the days of the botanist Ruiz, who protested against\r\nit, and declared that it was very injurious to the trees, many having\r\nbeen destroyed by it.[46] Later accounts, however, show that the\r\nbark-collectors of Loxa are as thoughtlessly destructive as those in\r\nother parts of South America. They often pull up the roots, while the\r\nannual burning of the slopes, and the continual cropping of the young\r\nshoots by cattle, assist the work of destruction.[47]\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, well that the _C. Chahuarguera_ and _C. Uritusinga_,\r\nthe earliest known and among the most valuable of the chinchona-trees,\r\nshould have been saved from extinction by timely introduction into\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nThe annual export of Loxa bark, from the port of Payta, is from 800 to\r\n1000 cwts.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--THE \"RED-BARK\" REGION, ON THE WESTERN SLOPES OF CHIMBORAZO.\r\n\r\nThe species yielding \"red bark,\" the richest and most important of\r\nall the Chinchonæ, is found in the forests on the western slopes of\r\nMount Chimborazo, along the banks of the rivers Chanchan, Chasuan, San\r\nAntonio, and their tributaries. So early as 1738 Condamine spoke of\r\n\"red bark\" (_cascarilla colorada_) as being of superior quality;[48]\r\nand Pavon sent home specimens of the \"red bark of Huaranda,\" and named\r\nthe species _C. succirubra_. Some of these are now in the British\r\nMuseum; and in the collection of Ruiz and Pavon, in the botanical\r\ngardens at Madrid, I found capsules, flowers, and leaves marked\r\n\"_cascarilla colorada de los cerros de San Antonio_.\" In 1857 Dr.\r\nKlotzsch, an eminent German botanist, read a paper at Berlin,[49]\r\nelaborately describing the \"red bark\" as a product of _C. succirubra_,\r\nfrom a very good specimen of Pavon's in the Berlin Museum. Mr. Howard\r\nhas also received a specimen from Alausi, and he is inclined to the\r\nbelief that there are several varieties of _C. succirubra_, and one or\r\ntwo allied species, as yet undescribed.[50] Much light was thrown upon\r\nthe history of this valuable species by Mr. Spruce, when he penetrated\r\ninto the forests to collect seeds and plants for transmission to India\r\nin 1860.\r\n\r\nThough little was known of the tree until quite lately, there was never\r\nany doubt concerning the value of the bark. In 1779 a Spanish ship\r\nfrom Lima, bound to Cadiz, was captured off Lisbon by the 'Hussar'\r\nfrigate, and her cargo consisted chiefly of \"red bark,\" part of which\r\nwas imported into England. In 1785 and 1786 Ruiz states that the\r\ncollectors began to gather the bark of _C. succirubra_, and sell it at\r\nGuayaquil, and from that time it continued to be found in the European\r\nmarkets. It contains a larger proportion of alkaloids than any other\r\nkind, amounting to as much as from 3 to 4 per cent. of the substance of\r\nthe bark, and of this a fair share is quinine. Fine samples yield 3.9\r\nper cent., selling at 8_s._ 9_d._ per lb.; and the quill bark from the\r\nsmaller branches 3.6 per cent.[51] Mr. Howard has recently procured 8.5\r\nper cent. of alkaloids from a specimen of \"red bark.\" A large supply\r\nof plants of this species is flourishing in India and Ceylon, and,\r\nfrom the richness of the species, the comparatively low elevation at\r\nwhich it thrives, and its hardy nature, it may be expected to become a\r\ncultivated plant of great value and importance.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 the export of bark from the port of Guayaquil, the place of\r\nshipment for the _C. succirubra_, amounted to 7006 quintals, valued at\r\n23,353_l._[52] In 1849-50 Dr. Weddell gives the amount at 1042 quintals.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--THE NEW-GRANADA REGION.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the chinchona-trees was fully established in the\r\nmiddle of the last century, and, Don Miguel de Santistevan, the\r\ndirector of the mint at Bogota, having addressed a memorial on the bark\r\ntrade (_estanco de cascarilla_) to the Viceroy Marquis of Villar in\r\n1753, the attention of the Spanish Government was seriously turned to\r\nthe subject. When the Viceroy Don Pedro Mesia de la Cerda, Marquis de\r\nla Vega de Armijo, went out to Bogota in 1760,[53] he was accompanied\r\nby the botanist Don José Celestino Mutis, a native of Cadiz, who was\r\nappointed to conduct a botanical survey of New Granada, and especially\r\nto investigate the bark of the chinchona-trees.[54]\r\n\r\nIn 1772 Mutis found these trees in the neighbourhood of Bogota, and\r\ndescribed four kinds in 1792, which he called _C. lancifolia_, _C.\r\ncordifolia_, _C. oblongifolia_, and _C. ovalifolia_, yielding four\r\nkinds of barks--_anaranjada_, _amarilla_, _roja_, and _blanca_, or\r\norange-coloured, yellow, red, and white.[55] He declared the _C.\r\nlancifolia_ to be excellent for intermittent fevers, in which he was\r\nright, and to be identical with the _C. Condaminea_ of Loxa, in which\r\nhe was wrong; the _C. cordifolia_ he recommended for remittent fevers,\r\nand the other two for inflammatory diseases. In reality the two last\r\nare not chinchonas at all, but belong to the genus _Ladenbergia_,\r\nand contain no fever-dispelling alkaloids whatever; while the _C.\r\nCordifolia_ is so poor in alkaloids as to be practically worthless.\r\n\r\nWhile Mutis, and his disciples Caldas and Zea, were prosecuting their\r\nresearches in New Granada, an expedition under the botanists Ruiz and\r\nPavon was sent to Peru; and an acrimonious paper war sprang up between\r\nthe rivals, as to the respective merits of the barks of New Granada\r\nand Peru. Ruiz declared the New Granada kinds to be inferior to those\r\nof Peru, while Mutis contradicted him, and Zea[56] went so far as to\r\nmaintain that the species found by Ruiz and Pavon in Peru were mere\r\nvarieties of the four chinchonas of Mutis, growing near Bogota.[57]\r\n\r\nThe _C. lancifolia_ of Mutis is dispersed in wild inaccessible\r\nforests, while the other three kinds grow in partly cultivated and\r\ninhabited regions, and their barks are therefore much more easy to\r\ncollect. These worthless barks were, therefore, largely exported from\r\nCarthagena and Santa Martha, while the valuable _C. lancifolia_ was\r\nneglected; and the consequence was that the barks of New Granada fell\r\nentirely into discredit for many years. In about 1849, however, Dr.\r\nSanta Maria of Bogota discovered the _C. lancifolia_ afresh, producing\r\nthe _quina anaranjada_, and it has recently been found in the whole\r\ncordillera from Bogota to Popayan, and largely exported between 1849\r\nand 1855, when the supplies began to fail.\r\n\r\nDr. Karsten, a distinguished German botanist, has lately returned\r\nfrom a residence of some years in New Granada, where he thoroughly\r\nexamined the region of _C. lancifolia_. His remarks on the production\r\nof alkaloids in chinchona barks are very important. He came to the\r\nconclusion that the content of alkaloids was not always the same in\r\nthe same species of chinchona, and that the soil and relations of\r\nclimate, on which the nourishment of the plant depends, exercise\r\nconsiderable influence. He also assumes, what is undoubtedly true, that\r\nthe chinchonæ with the capsule opening from the base and crowned by\r\nthe calyx, with a corolla of delicate texture and bearded edges, and\r\ngenerally unindented seed-lobes, give febrifugal barks; but his further\r\nposition that the short oval or elliptic capsules are a sign of a\r\nregularly larger content of alkaloids, while long capsules show a small\r\nquantity or total absence of quinine and chinchonine, though doubtless\r\ncorrect so far as Dr. Karsten's personal observation extended, will not\r\nbear general application. The _C. succirubra_, the richest of all the\r\nbarks in alkaloids, would certainly come under the latter head. Dr.\r\nKarsten's observations on the differences in the structure of the false\r\nand true barks are also exceedingly valuable.\r\n\r\nThe _C. lancifolia_ of New Granada has been found to contain as much as\r\n2-1/2 per cent. of quinine and from 1 to 2 per cent. of chinchonine.\r\nThe trees are found in forest-regions veiled in fog and rain, and often\r\nexposed to frost, where the temperature ranges from freezing-point to\r\n77° Fahr., at heights of 7000 feet and upwards above the level of the\r\nsea. They attain a height of 80 feet and 5 feet in diameter, but the\r\naverage size is 30 or 40 feet high and 3 feet in girth.[58] Seeds of\r\nthis species, collected by Dr. Karsten, were sent to Java, and there\r\nare now several plants raised from these seeds in India.[59]\r\n\r\nI find that between 1802 and 1807 the export of New Granada bark from\r\nthe port of Carthagena was 3,340,000 lbs.; the largest quantity in one\r\nyear being 48,330 lbs. in 1806. The first arrivals in Spain sold at\r\n5 to 6 dollars a pound, but in 1808 they were worth next to nothing,\r\nowing to the damaged state in which the bark arrived.[60]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--THE HUANUCO REGION IN NORTHERN PERU, AND ITS GREY BARKS.\r\n\r\nThe chinchona-trees, in the forests of the province of Huanuco, in\r\nNorthern Peru, were discovered by Don Francisco Renquifo in 1776, on\r\nthe mountain of San Cristoval de Cuchero or Cocheros; and Don Manuel\r\nAlcarraz brought the first sample of bark from Huanuco to Lima.\r\n\r\nAt almost the same time the Spanish government was organizing a\r\nbotanical expedition to explore the chinchona forests of Peru;\r\ncomposed of the botanists Don José Pavon, Don Hipolito Ruiz,\r\nthe Frenchman Dombey, and two artists named Brunete and Galvez.\r\nThey embarked at Cadiz on November 4th, 1777, and reached Callao\r\nApril 8th, 1778. Having made a large collection of plants in the\r\nneighbourhood of Lima, and despatched them to Spain,[61] they crossed\r\nthe Andes, explored the forests of Tarma, and then proceeded to\r\nHuanuco. They traversed the valley of Chinchao, explored the hill of\r\nCuchero or Cocheros, near Huanuco, and discovered seven species of\r\nchinchona-trees,[62] returning to Lima laden with the precious spoils\r\nof their expedition. They then sailed for Chile, and, after exploring\r\nthe greater part of that province, they returned to Lima, and sent off\r\ntheir botanical collections in fifty-three boxes, which were all lost\r\nin the shipwreck of the 'San Pedro de Alcantara,' off the coast of\r\nPortugal, in 1786. M. Dombey returned to Europe at about the same time.\r\n\r\nRuiz and Pavon then returned to Huanuco, explored the courses of the\r\nrivers Pozuzu and Huancabamba, and eventually established themselves\r\nat the farm of Macora, near Huanuco, where they resided for two months\r\nwith Don Francisco Pulgar and Don Juan Tafalla, who, by order of the\r\nking, had joined them as pupils and associates in their labours--the\r\nfirst as an artist, the second as a botanist. In August, 1785, a fire\r\nbroke out in their house, which destroyed all their journals and\r\ncollections; and they then undertook journeys through the forests of\r\nMuña, Pillao, and Chacahuasi, examining new species of chinchonæ.[63]\r\nOn April 1st, 1788, taking leave of Pulgar and Tafalla, they sailed\r\nfrom Callao, and reached Cadiz in September, when they commenced the\r\npublication of their great work the 'Flora Peruviana.'[64]\r\n\r\nTafalla continued his researches in the province of Huanuco, and\r\ndiscovered the _C. micrantha_ in 1797, in the cool and shady forests of\r\nMonzon and Chicoplaya. Pavon calls him \"noster alumnus.\"\r\n\r\nThe expeditions and discoveries of the Spanish botanists induced the\r\nmerchants of Lima to speculate in bark, and brought the grey barks of\r\nHuanuco into the European markets.[65] In 1785 Don Juan de Bezares,\r\na Lima merchant, devoted 2000 dollars to the exploration of the\r\nforests of Huamalies. He penetrated along the banks of the Monzon to\r\nChicoplaya, passing mountains thickly covered with chinchona-trees,\r\nand engaged people to collect bark. Thousands of arrobas were thus\r\nobtained of the bark of _C. glandulifera_; and having been appointed\r\nGovernor of Huamalies by the Viceroy Don Teodoro de Croix in 1788,\r\nBezares commenced the construction of a good road down the valley of\r\nthe Monzon.[66] Up to 1826 the principal supplies of grey bark were\r\nderived from _C. nitida_, but since that time they are believed to have\r\ncome chiefly from _C. micrantha_.\r\n\r\nScience owes much to the labours of Spanish botanists: the Spanish\r\nnation has every reason to be proud of her sons who explored the\r\nforests of the Andes with such untiring energy and distinguished\r\nability; and the names of Mutis, Ruiz, Pavon, and Tafalla occupy no\r\nunimportant place in the history of botanical research. Nor, in this\r\nrespect, have the natives of South America been behindhand. Caldas\r\nand Zea were worthy successors of Mutis; Franco Davila[67] represents\r\nthe botanical learning of Peru; while in more modern times the name of\r\nthe South American Triana is not unworthy to stand side by side with\r\nthose of the best botanists in Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHINCHONA MICRANTHA. (From Howard's 'Nueva Quinologia de\r\nPavon.')   Page 32.]\r\n\r\nAfter the days of Ruiz and Pavon, our chief authority on the grey barks\r\nof Huanuco is Dr. Poeppig, now a professor in Leipsic, who travelled in\r\nChile and Peru between the years 1827 and 1832.[68] He says that, as in\r\nNew Granada, the grey barks of Huanuco soon fell into discredit in the\r\nEuropean markets, owing to the adulterations of small speculators, and\r\nthat after 1815 the trade almost entirely ceased.[69] In 1830 scarcely\r\n1250 lbs. of bark found their way from Huanuco to Lima.\r\n\r\nIn the flourishing times of the Huanuco bark trade the _cascarilleros_,\r\nor bark-collectors, entered the forests in parties of ten or more, with\r\nsupplies of food and tools. They penetrated for several days into the\r\nvirgin forest until they came to the region of the chinchona-trees,\r\nwhen they built some rude huts and commenced their work. The\r\n_cateador_, or searcher, then climbed a high tree, and, with the aid of\r\nexperience and sharp sight, soon discovered the _manchas_ or clumps by\r\ntheir dark colour, and the peculiar reflection of the light from their\r\nleaves, easily observable even in the midst of these endless expanses\r\nof forest. The _cateador_, then, with never-erring instinct, conducted\r\nthe party for hours through the tangled brushwood, to the chinchona\r\nclump, using the wood-knife at every step. From a single clump they\r\noften obtained a thousand pounds of bark, which was sent up to be dried\r\nbeyond the limits of the forest. All depended on the success of this\r\noperation, for the bark easily becomes mouldy and loses its colour. The\r\n_cascarilleros_ got two rials for every twenty-five pounds of green\r\nbark stripped, from the speculator, and, as they could easily strip\r\nthree hundred pounds, they made two dollars a day. The bark cost the\r\nspeculator about four dollars, and the price at Lima was sixteen to\r\ntwenty dollars the arroba of twenty-five pounds.[70]\r\n\r\nDr. Poeppig makes some important remarks on the supposed danger of\r\nthe total extirpation of the chinchona-trees by reckless felling.\r\nCondamine and Ulloa believed that this would be the case in the Loxa\r\nforests, and Poeppig thinks that their apprehensions were well founded,\r\nbecause there the trees are not felled, but left standing deprived of\r\ntheir bark, in which case they are attacked by rot with extraordinary\r\nrapidity in tropical forests, hosts of insects penetrate to the stem,\r\nand the healthy roots become infected. But it is only necessary to\r\nobserve the precaution of hewing the stem as near as possible to the\r\nroot, in order to be sure of its after-growth. After six years, near\r\nCuchero, the young stems may already be felled again; but, at higher\r\naltitudes, where the most effective chinchonas are found, it requires\r\ntwenty years.[71]\r\n\r\nThe _C. micrantha_ abounds in the province of Huanuco, and the bark\r\nis known as _Cascarilla provinciana_. It yields 2.7 per cent. of\r\nchinchonine, and is much sought after for the Russian market.\r\n\r\nThe _C. nitida_ is a lofty tree growing in the higher regions of\r\nHuanuco, and is known by the natives as _quina cana legitima_ (genuine\r\ngrey bark). It grows at a greater height than the former species, and\r\nyields 2.2 per cent. of chinchonine.\r\n\r\nThe _C. Peruviana_, so named by Mr. Howard, is the _Cascarilla de\r\npata de gallinazo_ of the natives. It grows in the forests at a lower\r\nelevation than _C. nitida_, and yields 3 per cent. of chinchonine\r\nand chinchonidine, consequently indicating a considerable amount\r\nof febrifugal power. Quinine has also been found in samples of grey\r\nbark.[72]\r\n\r\nThe name of _grey_ bark refers to the striking effect of the\r\noverspreading thallus of various _Graphideæ_, forming groups, and\r\nindicating that the tree has grown in an open situation, exposed to\r\nrain and sunshine. A large supply of all the best kinds of grey bark is\r\nnow growing in India.[73]\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--THE CALISAYA REGION IN BOLIVIA AND SOUTHERN PERU.\r\n\r\nThe chinchona region of Bolivia and Southern Peru, although one of\r\nthe most important, was the last to contribute supplies of bark\r\nto the European markets. The trees first became known through the\r\ninvestigations of the German botanist Thaddæus Haenke, and a Spanish\r\nnaval officer named Rubin de Celis, who drew the attention of the\r\ninhabitants to the valuable forests on the eastern slopes of the\r\nBolivian Andes in 1776, though the unfortunate French naturalist Joseph\r\nde Jussieu had previously explored some portions of those forests.[74]\r\nBut it was not until 1820, when quinine was first discovered as the\r\nfebrifugal principle of bark, that the _Chinchona Calisaya_[75] was\r\nrecognised as containing more of that alkaloid than any other species.\r\n\r\nAfter 1820 the demand for _calisaya_ bark increased enormously; great\r\nnumbers of _cascarilleros_, or bark-collectors, entered the forests,\r\nand in a short time scarcely a tree remained in the vicinity of the\r\ninhabited places; and the bark was exported in such quantities that\r\nthe price fell very much.[76] It was not, however, until 1830 that\r\nthe Bolivian Government interfered in the bark trade. It was then\r\nconsidered necessary by General Santa Cruz's administration to check\r\nthe drain of this precious source of wealth by limiting the quantity\r\nof bark to be cut or exported; and in November, 1834, the Bolivian\r\nCongress decreed a law on the subject, which, however, never took\r\neffect. Finally, the cutting was prohibited for five years, but before\r\nthe expiration of that period the decree was abrogated, and an export\r\nduty of twelve dollars to twenty dollars the quintal, or cwt., was\r\nimposed.\r\n\r\nIn 1844 the Bolivian Congress authorized the President, General\r\nBallivian, to negotiate for the establishment of a national bank of\r\nbark, with the requisite capital, to export all the quinquina bark\r\nproduced in the country. This Bolivian legislation on the chinchona\r\nbark, which is considered, with justice, the most important product\r\nof their country, is very curious, and sufficiently demonstrates the\r\nfutility of attempting a system of protection and monopoly. Instead\r\nof taking measures to prevent the reckless destruction of the trees,\r\nto establish extensive nurseries for young plants, and thus ensure a\r\nconstant and sufficient supply of bark, these Bolivians have meddled\r\nwith the trade, attempted to regulate European prices by the most\r\nbarbarous legislation, and allowed the forests to be denuded of\r\nchinchona-trees. In 1845 the bark monopoly was given to Messrs. Jorge\r\nTesanos Pinto and Co., for five years, for the sum of 119,000 dollars,\r\nduring which time not more than 4000 quintals of bark were to be\r\nexported annually. This company gave such iniquitously low prices to\r\nthe _cascarilleros_ for their bark, that a clamour was raised against\r\nit, and the President, General Belzu, put an end to its existence in\r\nMarch 1849.\r\n\r\nFree trade, with a duty of twenty dollars the quintal, was then\r\nestablished during one year; but in 1850 exclusive privileges were\r\nagain granted to Messrs. Aramayo Brothers and Co., who were to pay\r\nthe Government 142,000 dollars a year for the right of exporting 7000\r\nquintals of bark annually, to be purchased of the _cascarilleros_, the\r\n_tabla_ or trunk bark at sixty dollars the quintal, and the _canuto_\r\nor quill bark at thirty to thirty-six dollars the quintal. The Pinto\r\ncompany had only paid eighteen to twenty-two dollars the quintal for\r\n_tabla_, and eight to ten dollars for _canuto_ bark. The favourable\r\nconditions thus offered to _cascarilleros_ induced so great a number\r\nof persons to undertake the business, that at the end of the first\r\nyear more than 20,000 quintals of bark arrived at La Paz--that is to\r\nsay, more than twice as much as the company had agreed for, and more\r\nthan the Pinto company had exported in five years. The Government then\r\nissued a decree to prevent the smuggling of bark, and another that no\r\nbark should be cut except for the company: but these measures caused\r\nmuch discontent, and in 1851 the Congress voted that the Executive\r\nhad exceeded its powers in making these arrangements with the Aramayo\r\ncompany, and declared them to be null and void. The Aramayo company\r\npurchased 14,000 quintals of the bark, and agreed to take the same\r\nquantity during the two following years, paying only a third of the\r\nprice in ready money; but a new company, formed under the name of Pedro\r\nBlaye and Co., engaged to purchase all the bark that was for sale, both\r\nat La Paz and Cochabamba, for ready money. It was evident that one or\r\nthe other of these companies must break, and finally that of Blaye\r\nfell. The Government then determined to export the bark which remained\r\nin store on its own account, paying the same price as had been agreed\r\non by the company.\r\n\r\nThese two companies lasted for two years, during which time the\r\nBolivian forests yielded 3,000,000 lbs. of bark. Such was the result of\r\nthe high prices which followed the fall of the Pinto monopoly; but it\r\nwas the rich contractors, and not the poor bark-collectors, who derived\r\nbenefit from the change.[77]\r\n\r\nIn 1851 Government prohibited the cutting of bark entirely, from the\r\n1st of January, 1852, to the 1st of January, 1854.[78] In 1858 a decree\r\nwas issued to regulate the transition of the system of monopoly to that\r\nof free-trade in bark, which caused an improvement in the prices in\r\nEuropean markets; and in November, 1859, Dr. Linares, then President\r\nof Bolivia, declared the right to cut bark in the forests to be free,\r\nand reduced the duty 25 per cent. on the current prices, to be fixed at\r\nthe beginning of each year.[79] This is the law which now regulates the\r\nbark trade in Bolivia, and, after a course of short-sighted meddling\r\nlegislation, extending over twenty years, in 1850 it still brought\r\n142,000 dollars annually into the public treasury, being a fifteenth\r\npart of the whole revenue of the Republic.\r\n\r\nFor exportation the bark is wrapped in fresh bullock-hides, having been\r\npreviously sewn up in thick cotton bags containing 155 lbs. each. These\r\nhide packages are called _serons_, a mule-load being 285 lbs., and the\r\ntransport to the coast costing about ten dollars for each mule-load.\r\n\r\nIt is to the persevering energy and great talent of that distinguished\r\nFrench botanist Dr. Weddell that we owe our knowledge of the chinchona\r\nregions of Bolivia and Southern Peru, and especially of the inestimable\r\nquinine-yielding species which he identified as the _C. Calisaya_.\r\nDr. Weddell accompanied the scientific expedition of the Count de\r\nCastelnau, which was sent out by Louis Philippe to South America,\r\nand, after crossing the vast empire of Brazil, entered Bolivia by the\r\ncountry of the Chiquitos in August, 1845. It was Dr. Weddell's chief\r\nobject to examine the chinchona region of this country, and his first\r\nstep was to proceed to Tarija, to ascertain the extreme southern limit\r\nof the chinchona-trees, which he discovered in 19° S. lat. He named\r\nthe species _C. Australis_. Dr. Weddell then commenced a thorough\r\nexploration of the Bolivian chinchona forests, making his way over the\r\nmost difficult country, from Cochabamba, through Ayopaya, Enquisivi,\r\nand the _yungus_[80] of La Paz; where the species of chinchonæ\r\ncontinued to multiply under his eye. In Enquisivi he first met with and\r\nstudied the _C. Calisaya_, which he named and described, collecting\r\nmuch information respecting the trade, and the methods of collecting\r\nbark. In 1847 he entered the province of Capaulican, descending the\r\nriver Tipuani, where he was attacked by fever, and ascending the\r\nMapiri. At Apollobamba, the centre of the most ancient bark-collecting\r\ndistrict, he found that the surrounding forests were quite cleared\r\nof chinchona-trees, and that it was necessary to seek for them at a\r\ndistance of ten or twelve days' journey from any inhabited place.\r\nIn June 1847 Dr. Weddell entered the Peruvian province of Caravaya,\r\nexamined the chinchona forests of the valleys of Sandia (San Juan del\r\nOro) and Tambopata, and concluded his investigations by a visit to the\r\nlovely ravine of Santa Anna, near Cuzco.\r\n\r\nDr. Weddell was accompanied in his visit to the valleys of Santa\r\nAnna by M. Delondre, a manufacturer of quinine at Havre, who, after\r\ncontemplating the project of paying a personal visit to the chinchona\r\nforests for twenty years, had at length set out, landed at Islay in\r\nJuly, 1847, and proceeded by way of Arequipa to Cuzco. M. Delondre\r\nappears to have employed a contractor to supply him with bark, who\r\nfailed in his engagements, and of whom the French quinine manufacturer\r\nbitterly complains as a second Dousterswivel.[81] MM. Weddell and\r\nDelondre finally left the chinchona forests in September, 1847, and\r\nset out for the coast of Peru. Dr. Weddell's valuable monograph on\r\nthe chinchona genus, '_Histoire naturelle des Quinquinas_,' the most\r\nimportant work that has yet appeared on the subject, was published at\r\nParis in 1849.\r\n\r\nIn 1851 Dr. Weddell undertook a second voyage to South America, and\r\nin 1852 he entered the Bolivian chinchona region of Tipuani by way of\r\nSorata. In descending the eastern slopes of the Andes he describes\r\nthe vegetation as taking new forms at every mile of the descent. The\r\nundergrowth was formed of _Melastomaceæ_ with violet-coloured flowers\r\n(_Chætogastra_), myrtles, _Gaultherias_, and _Andromedas_; lower down\r\nthere were many superb species of _Thibaudias_; and, where the great\r\nforests succeed to the smaller growth of the more elevated region,\r\nthe predominant trees were _Escallonias_, arborescent _Eupatorias_,\r\n_Bocconias_, and a fruit-bearing _Papilionacea_ with a scarlet corolla.\r\nHe encountered the first forest chinchona-trees at an elevation of 7138\r\nfeet, being the _C. ovata var. α vulgaris_. Descending still, he came\r\nto paccay-trees (_Mimosa Inga_) in flower, and met with the first plant\r\nof the shrubby variety of _C. Calisaya_, on an open grassy ridge or\r\n_pajonal_, at an elevation of 4800 feet.\r\n\r\nDr. Weddell descended the river Tipuani to Guanay, a mission of\r\nLecos Indians, and ascended the Coroico in a canoe made of the\r\nwood of a species of _Bombax_. The forests bordering on the river\r\nCoroico abounded in many species of palms, chiefly _Maximilianas_ and\r\n_Iriarteas_, the latter a singular kind with a trunk supported on long\r\naërial roots. There were also many trees of _C. micrantha_ on the\r\nbanks of the Coroico, a species of chinchona, the peculiarity of which\r\nis its fondness for the bottoms of valleys and banks of rivers, while\r\nmost of the others prefer elevated ridges or slopes of the mountains.\r\nWith it were growing trees of the beautiful _Cascarilla magnifolia_, an\r\nallied genus with deliciously fragrant flowers.\r\n\r\nThe _cascarilleros_ of Bolivia lead a hard and dangerous life. They\r\nonly value the _C. Calisaya_, the other species being for them\r\n_carhua-carhua_, a name given to all the inferior kinds. Those who\r\ncarry the bark on their shoulders from the interior of the forests\r\nreceive fifteen dollars for every quintal, and they also have to carry\r\nall their provisions and covering for the night. If by any accident\r\nthey are lost, or their provisions are destroyed, they die of hunger.\r\nDr. Weddell, on one occasion, while ascending the Coroico, landed\r\nwith the intention of passing the night on a beach well shaded by\r\ntrees. Here he found the hut of a _cascarillero_, and near it a man\r\nstretched out on the ground in the agonies of death. He was nearly\r\nnaked, and covered with myriads of insects, whose stings had hastened\r\nhis end. His face was so swollen as to be wholly unrecognisable, and\r\nhis limbs were in a frightful state. On the leaves which formed the\r\nroof of the hut were the remains of this unfortunate man's clothes, a\r\nstraw hat and some rags, with a knife, and an earthen pot containing\r\nthe remains of his last meal, a little maize, and two or three\r\n_chuñus_. Such is the end to which their hazardous occupation exposes\r\nthe bark-collectors--death in the midst of the forests, far from all\r\nfriends--a death without help, and without consolation.\r\n\r\nDr. Weddell returned to La Paz by ascending the Coroico, and the\r\nresults of his second visit to the chinchona forests appeared in an\r\nentertaining book of travels.[82] To this able botanist and intrepid\r\nexplorer science is indebted, to no small extent, for the present state\r\nof our knowledge of the chinchona genus.\r\n\r\nThe _C. Calisaya_ species has been divided by Dr. Weddell into\r\ntwo varieties, namely, a _vera_ and β _Josephiana_. The former,\r\nwhen growing under favourable circumstances, is a tall tree, often\r\nlarger round than twice a man's girth, with its leafy head rising\r\nabove all the other trees of the forest. The leaves are oblong or\r\nlanceolate-obovate, pitted in the axils of the veins, with a shining\r\ngreen surface, and reddish veins. The flowers, which hang in large\r\npanicles, are a rosy-white colour, with laciniæ rose-colour, and\r\nbordered by marginal white hairs. The capsule is smooth, and about\r\ntwice as long as broad. This tree grows on declivities, and steep\r\nrugged places of the mountains, from 4900 to 5900 feet above the sea,\r\nin the forests of Enquisivi, Capaulican, Apollobamba, and Larecaja\r\nin Bolivia, and of Caravaya in Peru. The trunk may be known by the\r\nperiderm of the bark, sometimes of a greyish-white, sometimes brown\r\nor blackish, being always marked by longitudinal ridges or cracks, a\r\ncharacteristic remarked of no other tree of these forests, excepting\r\none or two of the same family. The taste is strongly bitter, which\r\nis apparent directly the tip of the tongue touches it, and, when the\r\nexterior receives a cut, a yellow gummy resinous matter exudes from it.\r\nThe bark comes off with great ease, like peeling a mushroom, while, in\r\nthe inferior kinds, and above all in the false chinchonas, it strips\r\ntransversely, and with much greater difficulty. A good tree yields 150\r\nto 175 pounds of dried bark.\r\n\r\nThe other variety of _C. Calisaya_, called _ychu cascarilla_, or\r\n_cascarilla del pajonal_, by the natives, was named _Josephiana_ by\r\nDr. Weddell after the unfortunate French botanist Joseph de Jussieu.\r\nIt is a shrub, not attaining a greater height than six and a half to\r\nten feet, and growing on open grassy slopes, at much higher elevations\r\nthan the tree _Calisaya_. There is another tree variety with a somewhat\r\ndarker leaf, which Dr. Weddell classed as a distinct species, and\r\ncalled _C. Boliviana_ in 1849, but which he now considers to be a\r\nmere variety of _C. Calisaya_. The other good kinds in the forests\r\nof Bolivia and Caravaya are _C. micrantha_, and two varieties of _C.\r\novata_.\r\n\r\nDr. Weddell brought seeds of _C. Calisaya_ to Paris, which were raised\r\nin the Jardin des Plantes in 1848, and others in the garden of the\r\nHorticultural Society in London, where one of the plants flowered.[83]\r\nMany of these plants were given away, and some of them were sent by the\r\nDutch Government to Java.\r\n\r\nPlants of _C. Calisaya_ are now flourishing in India. The yield of\r\nquinine for the best kinds of _calisaya_ bark is 3.8 per cent., that\r\nfor the _Josephiana_ variety 3.29.[84]\r\n\r\nArica and Islay are the ports for the shipment of _calisaya_ bark; and\r\nin 1859 the quantity and value exported were:--\r\n\r\n  From Arica      1926 quintals, worth £17,334\r\n   \"   Islay      1365    \"        \"    12,383\r\n                  ----                  ------\r\n                  3291                  29,717\r\n                  ----                  ------\r\n\r\n  Jan. 1st to Nov. 30th, 1860, Arica $160,260 = £35,000 (about).\r\n                      1860, Islay, 1077 quintals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  Rapid destruction of chinchona-trees in South America--Importance\r\n  of their introduction into other countries--M. Hasskarl's\r\n  mission--Chinchona plantations in Java.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE collection of bark in the South American forests was conducted from\r\nthe first with reckless extravagance; no attempt worthy the name has\r\never been made either with a view to the conservancy or cultivation\r\nof the chinchona-trees; and both the complete abandonment of the\r\nforests to the mercy of every speculator, as in Peru, Ecuador, and New\r\nGranada, and the barbarous meddling legislation of Bolivia, have led\r\nto equally destructive results. The bark-collector enters the forest\r\nand destroys the first clump of chinchona-trees he finds, without a\r\nthought of any measure to preserve the continuance of a supply of bark.\r\nThus, in Apollobamba, where the trees once grew thickly round the\r\nvillage, no full-grown one is now to be found within eight or ten days'\r\njourney:[85] and so utterly improvident are the collectors that, in the\r\nforests of Cochabamba, they bark the tree without felling, and thus\r\nensure its death; or, if they cut it down, they actually neglect to\r\ntake off the bark on the side touching the ground, to save themselves\r\nthe trouble of turning the trunk over.[86]\r\n\r\nA century ago Condamine[87] raised a warning voice against the\r\ndestruction that was going on in the forests of Loxa. Ulloa[88] advised\r\nthe Government to check it by legislation; soon afterwards Humboldt\r\nreported that 25,000 chinchona-trees were destroyed every year, and\r\nRuiz[89] protested against the custom of barking the trees, and leaving\r\nthem to be destroyed by rot. But nothing was ever done in the way\r\nof conservancy, either by the Government, or by private speculators\r\nwhose subsistence depended on a continued supply of bark. Dr. Weddell,\r\nalluding to this recklessness as regards _C. Calisaya_, observes that\r\n\"the forests of Bolivia, rich as they are, cannot long resist the\r\ncontinued attacks to which they have been recently exposed. He who, in\r\nEurope, sees these enormous and ever-increasing masses of bark arrive,\r\nmay perhaps believe that they will continue to do so; but he who sees\r\nthe chinchona-trees in their native forests, and knows the real truth,\r\nis obliged to think otherwise.\"\r\n\r\nThere is, however, no danger of the actual extirpation of the trees\r\nunless the plan is adopted of leaving them standing, and stripped\r\nof their bark, as in the Loxa forests. Poeppig says that, in these\r\ncases, the trees in the tropical forests are attacked by rot with\r\nextraordinary rapidity; hosts of insects penetrate the stem to complete\r\nthe work of destruction, and the healthy root becomes infected. Thus\r\nthe valuable species called _C. Uritusinga_ has really been almost\r\nexterminated.\r\n\r\nBut where the trees are felled it is only necessary to observe the\r\nprecaution of hewing the stem as near as possible to the root, in order\r\nto be sure of its after-growth.[90] Under these circumstances, after\r\nsix years the young trees are ready to be felled again in the milder\r\nregions, and after twenty years in cold and exposed localities. From\r\nthe base of the stems, when not barked, a number of shoots spring out\r\nbetween bark and wood; and Dr. Karsten says that, though an interval\r\nof rest of twelve or fifteen years must be given to the forests where\r\nthe chinchona-trees have thus been felled, this only promotes further\r\ninvestigation in the endless untrodden forests, while, in the mean\r\ntime, the younger generation is growing up in those which have already\r\nbeen exhausted.[91]\r\n\r\nThe danger, therefore, is not in the actual annihilation of the\r\nchinchona-trees in South America, but lest, with the increasing demand,\r\nthere should be long intervals of time during which the supply would\r\ncease, owing to the forests being exhausted, and requiring periods\r\nof rest. In many districts this is already the case. The bark which\r\ncomes from Loxa is in the minutest quills, and in the forests of\r\nCaravaya, after an interval of rest of several years, the root-shoots\r\nhad scarcely grown to a sufficient size to yield anything but quill\r\nbark. Then again the supplies of bark from South America are not nearly\r\nsufficient to meet the demand, and the price is kept so high as to\r\nplace this inestimable remedy beyond the means of millions of natives\r\nof fever-visited regions. For these reasons the incalculable importance\r\nof introducing the chinchona-plant into other countries adapted for its\r\ngrowth, and thus escaping from entire dependence on the South American\r\nforests, has long occupied the attention of scientific men in Europe.\r\n\r\nIn 1839 Dr. Royle, in his 'Illustrations of Himalayan Botany,'[92]\r\nrecommended the introduction of the chinchona-plants into India,\r\npointing out the Neilgherry and Silhet hills as suitable sites for\r\nthe experiment, and Lord William Bentinck took some interest in the\r\nproject. M. Fée had previously recommended the introduction of these\r\nplants into the French colonies;[93] and in 1849 both Dr. Weddell[94]\r\nand M. Delondre[95] strongly urged the adoption of this measure. The\r\nformer declared that posterity would bless those who should carry this\r\nidea into execution.[96]\r\n\r\nThe Dutch, who possess in the island of Java a range of forest-covered\r\nmountains admirably adapted for chinchona cultivation, were, however,\r\nthe first to take active steps for its introduction into the Eastern\r\nHemisphere; and their praiseworthy exertions deserve, what they lay\r\nclaim to with justice, the approbation of the whole civilized world.\r\nThe experiment in Java, however, has only been tried with a very\r\nlimited number of valuable species of chinchonæ, and has met with very\r\nlimited success, owing to the introduction of worthless kinds, and to\r\nmistakes in the cultivation, committed during the first few years.\r\n\r\nFor the last thirty years Dutch scientific men, among whom the name\r\nof the botanist Blume may be mentioned, had urged their Government\r\nto undertake the introduction of chinchona-plants into Java. But it\r\nwas not until the year 1852 that M. Pahud, the Dutch Minister of the\r\nColonies, was authorized to employ an agent to collect plants and seeds\r\nof valuable species in Peru, and to convey them to Java. He selected,\r\nfor this important mission, M. Justus Charles Hasskarl, a botanist who\r\nhad for some time superintended the gardens in Java, but who was a\r\nstranger to South America--ignorant of the country, the people, and the\r\nlanguages--unacquainted with the forests where the chinchona-trees are\r\nfound, and who had never seen them growing in their natural state. He\r\nsailed for Peru in December, 1852, with orders not to confine himself\r\nto the _Calisaya_ plant, but to collect plants and seeds of as many\r\ndifferent species as possible. His original orders were to proceed\r\nfrom Guayaquil to the chinchona-forests of Loxa in the first instance;\r\nbut he changed his plan, and, landing at Lima, crossed the cordilleras\r\nin May, 1853.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult, in making a chance journey from the coast to\r\nthe forests of the Eastern Andes, to hit upon a part where valuable\r\nspecies of chinchona-trees are not known to exist. There are such\r\nspaces--forest tracts--intervening between the more favoured regions,\r\nwhere only species of little value are found, such as _C. pubescens_,\r\n_C. scrobiculata_, &c.; and on one of these, between the region of grey\r\nbarks in Huanuco and that of _C. Calisaya_ in Caravaya, M. Hasskarl,\r\nthrough being unacquainted with the localities, was so unfortunate as\r\nto stumble. He crossed the Andes by the road from Lima to Tarma, and\r\ndescended the eastern slopes into the montañas of Vitoc, Uchubamba,\r\nand Monobamba; returning thence by Xauxa into the loftier region\r\nof the Andes. Near Uchubamba he saw trees which he believed to be\r\n_C. Calisaya_; but that species is never found to the north of the\r\nprovince of Caravaya. He however collected a quantity of seeds of\r\nthis imaginary _C. Calisaya_, and four packets of a species which he\r\ncalled _C. ovata_, with smaller quantities of _C. pubescens_ and _C.\r\namygdalifolia_.\r\n\r\nThe species called by M. Hasskarl _C. ovata_ now forms the bulk of\r\nthe chinchona-plantations in Java. He found it on dry sunny hills,\r\nwithout much shelter from the sun, in a very sandy micaceous soil,\r\nat an elevation of 5500 to 6000 feet above the sea. It is sometimes\r\na mere shrub, but occasionally rises to fifteen or twenty-five feet,\r\nwith elegant pink flowers and reddish fruit. The native name is\r\n_cascarilla crespilla chica_; and as the _crespilla grande_ is the\r\n_C. ovata_ of Weddell, it is probable that M. Hasskarl was thus led\r\ninto the mistake of calling his new species _C. ovata_. The leaves are\r\nsmooth above, with a felt-like pubescence on the under surface, and\r\nthe hairy capsules are probably an indication of the worthlessness\r\nof the species.[97] In fact, no good kinds are found in this part of\r\nthe country, and all the seeds sent home by M. Hasskarl were equally\r\nvalueless. He collected specimens of _C. lanceolata_ of Pavon, at a\r\nplace called \"Escalera de San Rafael,\" on the road between Uchubamba\r\nand Xauxa.[98]\r\n\r\nFrom Xauxa M. Hasskarl went to Cuzco, and thence in September to\r\nSandia in the province of Caravaya; but finding that the seeds of\r\nchinchona-trees are ripe in August, and that he had arrived too late,\r\nhe returned to Lima, and finally took up his abode at Arequipa until\r\nthe following year. In March, 1854, he again set out, crossed the Andes\r\nto Puno, and, after wandering over part of Bolivia, at length reached\r\nthe little village of Sina in Caravaya, near the frontier between Peru\r\nand Bolivia, in April. He had assumed the feigned name of José Carlos\r\nMüller, and had printed it on his cards, one of which he presented to\r\nthe governor of Sina, Don Juan de la Cruz Gironda, requesting him to\r\nprocure a supply of chinchona-plants for him. Gironda refused, but\r\nintroduced the stranger to a Bolivian named Clemente Henriquez, a\r\nclever and intelligent, but dishonest and unscrupulous man. Henriquez\r\nagreed to procure 400 plants of _C. Calisaya_ for a certain sum, part\r\nof which was to be paid down, and the remainder on delivery of the\r\nplants. M. Hasskarl then went on to the village of Sandia, where he\r\ntook up his abode, without entering the chinchona forests, and waited\r\nthere until the plants should arrive. Meanwhile Henriquez employed an\r\nIndian to collect the stipulated number of plants, round a place called\r\nYchu-corpa,[99] on the frontier of Bolivia; and when they were brought\r\nto him he went to Sandia, delivered them to M. Hasskarl, and received\r\nhis money. An outcry was afterwards raised against Henriquez, by the\r\npeople inhabiting villages bordering on the chinchona forests, who\r\nconsidered that their interests would be injured by the exportation of\r\nthe plants: they declared they would cut his feet off if they caught\r\nhim, and he has ever since been obliged to live at Pelechuco, in\r\nBolivia.[100] This feeling has rendered any future operations of a like\r\nnature exceedingly difficult.\r\n\r\nM. Hasskarl left Sandia with these plants in June, 1854, but they\r\nwere not placed in Wardian cases at the port of Islay until August,\r\nand on the 27th of that month he finally left the coast of Peru in a\r\nsailing vessel, and shaped his course direct for Java.[101] He arrived\r\nat Batavia with twenty Wardian cases on December 13th, but all his\r\nplants have since died except two.[102] On his arrival M. Hasskarl was\r\nintrusted with the cultivation of chinchona-plants in Java, with the\r\nrank of Assistant-Resident, and was made a Knight of the Netherlands\r\nLion, and Commander of the Order of the Oaken Crown.[103]\r\n\r\nBesides the plants brought by M. Hasskarl, a plant of _C. Calisaya_,\r\nraised in Paris from seeds sent home by Dr. Weddell, had arrived in\r\nJava; as well as plants raised from seeds previously sent from Peru,\r\nand seeds of _C. lancifolia_ sent by Dr. Karsten from New Granada,\r\nthrough the Governor of Curaçoa; and thus the experimental chinchona\r\ncultivation in Java was commenced.\r\n\r\nAlthough through various circumstances the mission to South America was\r\nnot very successful, yet M. Hasskarl deserves the greatest credit for\r\nthe zeal and determination displayed by him in his journeys, during\r\nwhich he was surrounded by no ordinary amount of difficulties and\r\ndangers. He certainly proved himself to be a most indefatigable and\r\ncourageous traveller.\r\n\r\nM. Hasskarl, and his associate M. Teysmann, selected the site for the\r\nfirst chinchona plantation, at a place called Tjibodas, thirty miles\r\nsouth of Batavia, on the northern slope of the volcanic range which\r\ntraverses Java from east to west, and 4400 feet above the sea. Ground\r\nwas also prepared at Tjipannas, half a mile above Tjibodas, and 4700\r\nfeet above the sea. These sites were covered with rasamala-trees of\r\nimmense size (_Liquidambar Altingia_,[104] _Blume_), which had to\r\nbe felled. The superintendents, deceived by the sight of such large\r\ntrees, imagined that the soil was deep and good, but in reality it was\r\nnot more than six inches deep, and underneath there was a formation\r\ncompletely impenetrable to roots, called _tjadas_, composed of sand\r\nand small stones of trachytic origin, strongly cemented together by\r\ncrater slime, the whole being as hard as rock. Not one of the huge\r\nrasamala-trees in reality pierced this _tjadas_ with their roots, but\r\nran along its surface horizontally for hundreds of feet. In these\r\nlocalities the chinchona-plants continued to languish during the year\r\n1855, and in the end of that year the experiment presented a most\r\nhopeless appearance.\r\n\r\nThe causes of this failure are sufficiently evident. After the felling\r\nof the rasamala-trees, the young chinchona-plants were exposed to\r\nthe full force of a burning sun, without any shade whatever, in an\r\nextraordinarily thin soil upon a rocky bank impenetrable to roots. The\r\ndead and rotted roots of the rasamala-trees were allowed to remain,\r\ndeveloping fungi which attacked the chinchona-roots; and the sites\r\nthemselves were in much too low and warm a climate. In consequence of\r\nthe combined effects of these adverse influences, there were only 300\r\nchinchona-plants in Java, in a sickly unpromising condition, after the\r\nlapse of the first eighteen months.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1855, Dr. Franz Junghuhn came to Java with 139\r\nchinchona-plants, raised from seeds in Holland. They were delivered\r\nover to M. Hasskarl, and in six months seventy-six of them were dead.\r\nIn June, 1856, M. Pahud, who had been Minister of the Colonies, and\r\nwas then Governor-General of Netherlands India, relieved M. Hasskarl\r\nof his duties, and gave the entire charge of the chinchona experiment\r\nto Dr. Junghuhn, an experienced scientific botanist. Dr. J. E. de\r\nVry, a chemist of some eminence, was also sent to Java, charged with\r\nthe special duty of applying chemical tests to the barks of the\r\nchinchona-plants, to ascertain their intrinsic value.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Junghuhn took charge the prospects of the experiment were\r\nvery far from promising, and he has displayed an amount of intelligent\r\nperseverance, combined with much practical knowledge, which is\r\ndeserving of all praise. He found the 139 chinchona-plants which\r\nhe himself brought out reduced to sixty-three; the seeds of _C.\r\nlancifolia_ represented by three sickly plants; the collection of\r\nplants of _C. Calisaya_ brought by M. Hasskarl from Peru, also reduced\r\nto three; two plants of _C. Calisaya_ raised from seeds sent home by\r\nDr. Weddell; and the remainder, consisting of the worthless species\r\ncollected by M. Hasskarl in Uchubamba, making a total of only 300\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 a new system was introduced, money was lavishly expended, an\r\nefficient establishment was formed, and a great effort was commenced\r\nto secure the successful cultivation of the chinchona-plants. The\r\nsuperintendent receives 1350_l._ a year, the chemist 1100_l._ a year,\r\nand under them there are eight Dutch overseers; the total amount paid\r\nin salaries being 3256_l._ a year.[105] It was ordered that, until\r\nthe cultivation is considered as quite successful, it should remain\r\nunder the management of scientific men, but that finally it should be\r\nhanded over to the ordinary direction of the chiefs of the provincial\r\ngovernment, under the Director of Cultures; and a memorandum of\r\ninstructions, consisting of eighteen articles, was drawn up for the\r\nguidance of Dr. Junghuhn and his subordinates.\r\n\r\nFinding the chinchona-plants in so deplorable a condition, one of\r\nDr. Junghuhn's first measures was to transplant them from Tjibodas\r\nto a more suitable site on the Malawar mountains, a very delicate\r\nand hazardous operation, which was, however, successfully performed:\r\nin 1857 plants both of _C. Calisaya_ and of the worthless species\r\nblossomed, and in 1858 bore fruit. Dr. Junghuhn found that the latter\r\ncould not be the _C. ovata_ as named by M. Hasskarl; but he was\r\nhimself equally mistaken in naming it _C. Lucumæfolia_, from a fancied\r\nresemblance to that species of Pavon.[106] The great mistake of the\r\nDutch has been in propagating this worthless species, and spending\r\nvast sums of money on its cultivation, tempted by finding that its\r\nnature was hardy, and that it required less care than the delicate _C.\r\nCalisaya_.\r\n\r\nIn 1858 several of the plants sickened from the attacks of destructive\r\ninsects (_Bostrichus_ or _Dermestes_), not larger than the head of a\r\npin, which pierced horizontally into the bark and wood of the stem\r\nand branches, where they laid their eggs and died. Dr. Junghuhn\r\nconjectures that they were imported from Peru; as they are not natives\r\nof the Java forests, and I found these boring insects in the wood of\r\nchinchona-trees in the forests of Caravaya. Twenty-nine trees were thus\r\nattacked in Java, and died.\r\n\r\nDr. Junghuhn established his new plantations on the slopes of the\r\nMalawar mountains, where he has found that the _C. Calisaya_ is much\r\nmore sensitive than his so-called _C. Lucumæfolia_; and that very\r\nslight differences in temperature, in elevation, in light, in shade,\r\nand in moisture, exercise a very evident influence on the former, while\r\nthe latter remain quite unaffected by them. He considers that the best\r\nconditions for the growth of _C. Calisaya_ on the Malawar mountains\r\n(between latitude 7° and 8° S.) are good loose forest soil and moderate\r\nshade, at an elevation from 5000 to 5700 feet above the sea. The _C.\r\nCalisayas_, when they receive light only on their crowns, and are\r\nsurrounded by the dark wood, have a rapidly rising, slender, tall stem,\r\ndevoid of side branches; whilst, when they stand on clear open spots,\r\nthey grow much stronger in width and thickness, but are shorter, and\r\nhave numerous side branches.\r\n\r\nThe following is Dr. Junghuhn's method of cultivation. Pots, made of\r\nbamboo-joints, are loosely filled with finely-sifted earth, composed\r\nof one-fourth part of black volcanic sand (felspar, hornblende, and\r\nmagnet iron) mixed with brown forest soil. The pots are then placed in\r\nthe interior of the forests, on beds of heaped-up earth laid out in\r\nthe form of terraces, on the declivities of the mountains. A roof of\r\ndry grass, supported by stakes, and high enough to admit a side light,\r\nprotects the pots from the falling rain-drops. These seed-beds are from\r\n200 to 500 feet long, and extend in parallel lines between the trees,\r\nlike the steps of an amphitheatre. Each pot receives only one seed, and\r\nthe earth is kept constantly moist by watering twice daily with the\r\nsqueeze of a sponge.[107]\r\n\r\nThe pots remain standing on the seed-beds until the plants are about\r\nhalf a foot high, which takes about eight months; and during this\r\ntime they are turned every five or eight days, in order to prevent\r\nthe crooked growth of the plants, which always turn to the side where\r\nmost light falls on the beds. For the purpose of planting out, a few\r\nprincipal broad roads are made along the mountain ridge through the\r\nwood, united at intervals by cross footpaths, twenty-five feet asunder.\r\nAt the side of these footpaths, and twenty-five feet from each other,\r\nwide trenches are dug, and filled up with cleansed earth, so as to make\r\nslightly raised mounds, with gutters to carry off the rain-water. The\r\nyoung plants are placed in the loose earth on these mounds, and four\r\nstrong stakes, driven into the ground round them, are fastened together\r\nfour or five feet above their heads. This protects them from falling\r\nboughs, drip, and wild animals, for some years. Thus thousands of paths\r\nhave been cut in the forests, and planted with chinchona-trees, which\r\nare growing well. There are now nine nurseries in Java--Tjibodas on\r\nMount Gêdé; Tjiniruan on the south-west slope, and Tjiborum on the\r\nsouthern slope of Mount Malawar; Genting; Reong Gunung; Kawah Tjirvidei\r\nin the Kendeng mountains; one on Mount Patna; and two others.\r\n\r\nDr. Junghuhn, in adopting the above method of cultivation, and in\r\naltering M. Hasskarl's arrangements, has run into an opposite extreme.\r\nHis system of planting the young chinchonas in the forests under dense\r\nshade[108] is most erroneous; and the way in which the seeds are\r\ntreated quite accounts for the small number which germinate.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of December, 1860, the number of chinchona-plants in Java\r\nwas as follows:--\r\n\r\n  _C. Calisaya_                       7,316 plants, and 1030 cuttings.\r\n  _C. lancifolia_                        80   \"      \"    28     \"\r\n  Species procured by M. Hasskarl   939,809   \"      \"    18     \"\r\n                                   --------\r\n  Total                             947,205 plants.[109]\r\n\r\nBesides 700,264 seeds in stock, or sown. The extreme height attained\r\nby the tallest _C. Calisaya_ was, at the same date, fifteen feet, and\r\nby the worthless species twenty-eight feet. One of the trees of _C.\r\nlancifolia_ had also attained a height of fifteen feet.\r\n\r\nDr. de Vry, the eminent chemist who is associated with Dr. Junghuhn,\r\nand who had for two years previously occupied himself with the study\r\nof the chinchona alkaloids, has been actively engaged in careful\r\ninvestigations of the chinchona barks in Java. With regard to the _C.\r\nCalisaya_ his results have been very satisfactory. From the trunk-bark\r\nof a plant of this species, six years old, he obtained, in August,\r\n1860, 5 per cent. of alkaloids; and from that of the branches, 2-1/2\r\nper cent. But the specimens of _C. Calisaya_ bark from Java, which have\r\nbeen sent to the Exhibition of 1862, have a very different appearance,\r\nand are much thinner than those from South America. This circumstance\r\nleads to the inference that the present system of cultivation in Java\r\nis erroneous. With the species introduced by M. Hasskarl, Dr. de Vry\r\nwas not so successful. The leaves, flowers, fruit, and bark of this\r\nspecies were sent to Mr. Howard by Dr. Junghuhn; and it was found\r\nthat the names of _C. ovata_, given it by M. Hasskarl, and of _C.\r\nLucumæfolia_ by Dr. Junghuhn, were equally erroneous. It was clear that\r\nit was one of the numerous worthless species, not previously described,\r\nand Mr. Howard, in the seventh number of his work, has named it _C.\r\nPahudiana_,[110] after M. Charles F. Pahud, who, as Minister of the\r\nColonies, sent M. Hasskarl to South America in 1852, and who, being\r\nappointed Governor-General of Netherlands India in 1855,[111] did so\r\nmuch to ensure the success of the chinchona experiment in Java. Up\r\nto 1860 Dr. de Vry had only obtained 0.4 per cent. of alkaloids from\r\nthe bark of _C. Pahudiana_, and Mr. Howard's examination coincides\r\nwith the analysis of Dr. de Vry in pronouncing it an inferior sort.\r\nIn 1861, however, he obtained 3 per cent. of alkaloids from the bark\r\nof the roots of a _C. Pahudiana_ plant eight years old, and 1-1/4 per\r\ncent. from the trunk-bark. From a tree aged two years and three months\r\nhe only got 0.09 per cent. from the trunk-bark, and 1.9 per cent. from\r\nthe root-bark, of which he states the greater part to be quinine;\r\nwhile in the trunk-bark there was not a trace of that alkaloid. This\r\nresult leads Dr. de Vry to conjecture that the quinine, once formed in\r\nthe roots, is employed in the growth of the plant, and that, when it\r\nattains its full growth, the trunk-bark will also be rich in quinine.\r\nIf this should not be the case, he hopes that the roots of the young\r\nplants may be used profitably for the manufacture of quinine. It is\r\nto be feared that the quinine in the trunk-bark will not increase\r\nwith age, for, while in the younger tree there was 1.9 per cent. of\r\nalkaloids in the roots, chiefly quinine, and 0.09 in the trunk-bark,\r\nin the older one there was 3 per cent. in the roots, of which 1.8 was\r\nquinine, and 1-1/4 per cent. in the trunk-bark, in which there was only\r\nthe minutest trace of quinine. Thus, while the quantity of quinine\r\ndecreased or remained stationary in the roots, the trunk-bark was still\r\ndestitute of that precious alkaloid.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that Dr. de Vry, in his earnest desire to discover\r\nquinine in a species upon which so much labour and anxiety, and such\r\nvast sums of money, had been expended, may have been deceived by\r\nappearances. Both from the form of the capsules, the absence of quinine\r\nin the upper bark, and the locality whence it was procured, there is\r\nevery reason to fear that the _C. Pahudiana_ is a worthless kind; and\r\nthe bark of this species, which has been sent to the Exhibition of\r\n1862, is so evidently valueless that no dealer would buy it. In all\r\nvaluable species there is a good percentage of alkaloids in the upper\r\nbark, and a very much smaller proportion, which, too, is amorphous\r\nand of little commercial value, in the bark of the roots. This law of\r\nnature, the existence of which is proved by all experience, would have\r\nto be reversed in order to enable the Dutch to extract large supplies\r\nof quinine from the roots of a species, such as _C. Pahudiana_, which\r\ncontains none in the upper bark.\r\n\r\nIt is much to be regretted that the scientific men in Java, instead\r\nof exerting all their skill and talent in the work of cultivating _C.\r\nCalisaya_ and _C. lancifolia_, of the value of which there is no doubt,\r\nshould have filled the forests of Java with a kind which from the first\r\nwas known to be of very doubtful value, was unknown in commerce, and\r\nthe cultivation of which will, it is to be feared, only end in loss and\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\nThe valuable species were found to be much more tender, and more\r\nsensitive to external unfavourable influences, than the _C. Pahudiana_;\r\nthe latter was therefore propagated rapidly, and unwisely allowed to\r\noutstrip the other kinds in the race, and the consequence has been that\r\nit has gained an immense preponderance. Thus, so far as valuable species\r\nof chinchona-plants are concerned, the Dutch experiment in Java has\r\nbeen attended by a very small measure of success. After three years\r\nthe Dutch gardeners only had forty plants of valuable species in\r\nJava, and after six years they had only increased their stock to seven\r\nthousand plants. It will presently be seen that far greater results\r\nwere attained in India within eighteen months of the first introduction\r\nof the chinchona-plants.\r\n\r\n  ----------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+----------\r\n                  |   1857.[9]   |  December,  |  December,  |\r\n                  | At Tjibodas. |  1859.[112] |  1860.[113] |  1861.\r\n                  +--------------+-------------+-------------+----------\r\n  _C.

Hasskarl and to his successors. They\r\nhave devoted great ability, no ordinary amount of scientific knowledge,\r\nand untiring perseverance to this good work; and, now that they have\r\nreceived plants of other really valuable species from India, there is a\r\nprospect that the chinchona cultivation in Java may eventually attain\r\nsuch a measure of success as will entitle Dr. Junghuhn and Dr. de Vry\r\nto the gratitude of their countrymen.[114]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION OF CHINCHONA-PLANTS INTO INDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY ARRANGEMENTS.\r\n\r\nTHE distribution of valuable products of the vegetable kingdom amongst\r\nthe nations of the earth--their introduction from countries where they\r\nare indigenous into distant lands with suitable soils and climates--is\r\none of the greatest benefits that civilization has conferred upon\r\nmankind. Such measures ensure immediate material increase of comfort\r\nand profit, while their effects are more durable than the proudest\r\nmonuments of engineering skill. With all their shortcomings, the\r\nSpaniards can point to vast plains covered with wheat and barley,\r\nto valleys waving with sugar-cane, and to hill-slopes enriched by\r\nvineyards and coffee-plantations, as the fruits of their conquest of\r\nSouth America. On the other hand, India owes to America the aloes which\r\nline the roads in Mysore, the delicious anonas, the arnotto-tree,\r\nthe sumach, the capsicums so extensively used in native curries, the\r\npimento, the papaw, the cassava which now forms the staple food of the\r\npeople of Travancore, the potato, tobacco, Indian corn, pine-apples,\r\nAmerican cotton, and lastly the chinchona: while the slopes of the\r\nHimalayas are enriched by tea-plantations, and the hills of Southern\r\nIndia are covered with rows of coffee-trees.\r\n\r\nIt is by thus adding to the sources of Indian wealth that England\r\nwill best discharge the immense responsibility she has incurred by\r\nthe conquest of India, so far as the material interests of that vast\r\nempire are concerned. Thus too will she leave behind her by far the\r\nmost durable monument of the benefits conferred by her rule. The\r\ncanals and other works of the Moguls were in ruins before the English\r\noccupied the country; but the melons which the Emperor Baber, the\r\nfounder of the Mogul dynasty, introduced into India, and which caused\r\nhim to shed tears while thinking of his far-off mountain-home, still\r\nflourish round Delhi and Agra. Centuries after the Ganges canal has\r\nbecome a ruin, and the great Vehar reservoir a dry valley, the people\r\nof India will probably have cause to bless the healing effects of the\r\nfever-dispelling chinchona-trees, which will still be found on their\r\nsouthern mountains.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the chinchona-plant into India was surrounded by\r\ndifficulties from which all other undertakings of a similar nature\r\nhave been free. When tea was introduced into the Himalayan districts,\r\nit had been a cultivated plant in China for many ages, and experienced\r\nChinese cultivators came with it. But the chinchona had never been\r\ncultivated; since the discovery of its value in 1638 it had remained\r\na wild forest tree; all information concerning it was solely derived\r\nfrom the observations of European travellers who had penetrated into\r\nthe virgin forests; and the only guidance for cultivators in India is\r\nto be found in the reports of these travellers, and in the experience\r\nslowly acquired by careful and intelligent trials.[115] Great as these\r\ndifficulties were, they were probably exceeded by the perils and risks\r\nof every description which must be encountered in collecting plants and\r\nseeds in South America, and conveying them in safety to India.\r\n\r\nBut the vast importance of the introduction of these plants into\r\nour Indian empire, and the inestimable benefits which would thus be\r\nconferred on the millions who inhabit the fever-haunted plains and\r\njungles, were commensurate with the difficulties of the undertaking.\r\nThe subject had occupied the attention of the Indian Government from\r\ntime to time, ever since Dr. Royle in 1839 advocated the introduction\r\nof quinine-yielding trees into India, in his work on Himalayan Botany;\r\nbut it was not until twenty years afterwards, in 1859, that any\r\nadequate steps were taken to effect this most desirable end, and to\r\nbring an antidote within the reach of the fever-stricken people of\r\nIndia, while adding a new source of wealth to the resources of that\r\ngreat dependency.\r\n\r\nThe proposal to introduce the chinchona-plants into India was\r\nfirst made officially in a despatch from the Governor-General,\r\ndated March 27th, 1852. It was referred to the late Dr. Royle, the\r\nreporter on Indian products to the East India Company, who drew up\r\nan able memorandum on the subject, dated June, 1852:--\"To the Indian\r\nGovernment,\" he said, \"the home supply of a drug which already costs\r\n7000_l._ a year would be advantageous in an economical point of\r\nview, and invaluable as affording means of employing a drug which is\r\nindispensable in the treatment of Indian fevers. I have no hesitation\r\nin saying that, after the Chinese teas, no more important plant could\r\nbe introduced into India.\" The only result of this application from\r\nIndia was that the Foreign Office was requested to obtain a supply of\r\nplants and seeds from the consuls in South America, and instructions\r\nto that effect were sent out to them in October, 1852. In the\r\nautumn of 1853 Mr. Mark wrote from Bogota that some delay would be\r\nnecessary, and nothing more was heard from that quarter; Mr. Sullivan,\r\nthe consul-general in Peru, replied that it would be impossible to\r\naccomplish a successful result, through the jealousy of the people;\r\nbut Mr. Cope, the excellent and venerable consul-general at Quito,\r\nmade a more satisfactory and substantial answer, in the shape of a box\r\nof chinchona plants and seeds from Cuenca and Loxa. They, however,\r\ndid not long survive the voyage to England. Seeds of _C. Calisaya_,\r\nprocured through Mr. Pentland, were sent to the botanical gardens\r\nat Calcutta, but did not germinate; and in 1853 six plants of the\r\nsame valuable species, contributed by the Horticultural Societies of\r\nEdinburgh and London, raised from seeds sent home by Dr. Weddell from\r\nBolivia, were taken out to Calcutta by Mr. Fortune. They arrived in\r\ngood order, but all died through gross carelessness in their removal to\r\nDarjeeling. In May, 1853, Dr. Royle drew up a second long and valuable\r\nreport upon the subject, and the question was then allowed to drop for\r\nsome years.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious coincidence that at the very time when Dr. Royle was\r\nwriting this report I was actually exploring some of the chinchona\r\nforests of Peru. But the object of my travels was of an antiquarian and\r\nethnological character, and I was in ignorance of the desire of the\r\nIndian Government to procure supplies of those plants, which I then\r\nonly admired for their beauty.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1856, Dr. Royle made a final attempt to induce the East India\r\nCompany to take efficient steps to procure supplies of chinchona plants\r\nand seeds from South America; and proposed to employ Dr. Jamieson, the\r\nable Professor of Botany in the University of Quito, for this purpose.\r\nThe lamented death of that eminent botanist Dr. Royle, to whom India\r\nowes so much, again put an end to all discussion of the subject for\r\nsome time; but in 1859 energetic measures were set on foot, which at\r\nlength effected the desired object fully and completely. Dr. Royle is\r\nwell known as the author of works on Himalayan botany, on the cotton\r\ncultivation and on the fibres of India, and of a 'Materia Medica'\r\ncontaining a valuable article on the chinchona genus, which he caused\r\nto be printed separately for circulation in India. For several years he\r\ntook the warmest interest in the proposed measures for the introduction\r\nof chinchona-plants into India, and used every influence at his\r\ncommand to effect this most important object. But he was not destined\r\nto see the final achievement of a design which he seems to have had so\r\nmuch at heart.\r\n\r\nIn 1859 my services were accepted to superintend the collection of\r\nchinchona plants and seeds in South America, and their introduction\r\ninto India; and I was authorised by Lord Stanley, then Secretary of\r\nState for India, to make such arrangements as should best ensure the\r\ncomplete success of an enterprise, the results of which were expected\r\nto add materially to the resources of our Indian Empire. The urgent\r\nnecessity of this measure had become more apparent since Dr. Royle's\r\ntime. Then the Government of India expended 7000_l._ a year upon\r\nquinine; but in 1857 the expenditure had risen to 12,000_l._, and\r\ncontinued to increase during the following years.[116]\r\n\r\nI at once determined to take measures for obtaining plants and seeds of\r\nall the valuable species of chinchonæ described in a former chapter; to\r\narrange so that, if possible, they should be collected simultaneously\r\nin the different regions separated by many hundreds of miles from each\r\nother; and that, warned by the fatal error of the Dutch in Java, no\r\nspecies should be introduced into India which did not possess bark of\r\nwell-established commercial value. In one of his reports Dr. Royle\r\nhad most truly said that \"the greater the number of species obtained,\r\nas well as the greater the extent of country over which the seeds\r\nare collected, the greater is the probability of finding soils and\r\nclimates in India for their successful culture.\" It was thus necessary\r\nto employ competent persons to collect in New Granada, Ecuador, the\r\nHuanuco forests of Northern Peru, and Caravaya or Bolivia at the same\r\ntime. I considered that it was essential that the proceedings should\r\nbe completed during the first year if possible, in order to give as\r\nshort a time as was practicable for the awakening of that narrow-minded\r\njealousy in the people of the South American Republics, which I was\r\nwell aware would sooner or later be aroused. It was also my duty to\r\nget the work done economically, and there could be no doubt that the\r\nemployment of several agents for a few months would cost less than the\r\nmission of a single traveller, who would have to make his way over\r\nthousands of miles, for three or four years. Time also was an object\r\nwith regard to the establishment of plantations in India.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State for India sanctioned all the details of my plan,\r\nwith the exception of the expedition to New Granada,[117] and the\r\nprovision of a steamer to convey the plants direct across the Pacific\r\nto India. But it was no easy matter to find agents possessed of the\r\nnecessary qualifications for the work. A personal acquaintance with the\r\nchinchona forests, a knowledge of the country, of the people, and of\r\nthe languages, were essential, as well as of the particular species of\r\nchinchona-trees growing in each region; and, as the service was to be\r\nperformed without delay, no time could be spared for acquiring any of\r\nthese qualifications.\r\n\r\nFor the chinchona forests in Ecuador I was so fortunate as to secure\r\nthe services of Mr. Spruce, an excellent botanist and most intrepid\r\nexplorer, who had been engaged for several years in the examination\r\nof the wilds of South America, and who was actually on the spot. Of\r\nhis qualifications there could be no doubt, but I could scarcely have\r\nventured to hope that the service which he undertook to perform would\r\nhave been done so completely and so thoroughly, and would have been\r\ncrowned with such undoubted success. It is perhaps invidious to make\r\ndistinctions, where all have worked so zealously; but it is due to Mr.\r\nSpruce to say that by far the largest share of credit is due to him,\r\nand that his name must take the most prominent place in connection\r\nwith the introduction of these precious plants into India. The region\r\nassigned to him was the most important, as it yielded the \"red-bark\"\r\ntree (_C. succirubra_), containing a larger percentage of febrifugal\r\nalkaloids than any other species; and I felt more sanguine of success\r\nin this quarter than in any other, because the country of the \"red\r\nbark\" was more accessible than any of the others, the forests being\r\non the western slopes of the Andes, navigable rivers flowing through\r\nthem to the Pacific Ocean, and there being, therefore, no necessity of\r\nconveying the plants over the snowy wilds of the cordilleras. I also\r\nrequested Mr. Spruce to make an arrangement for procuring seeds of the\r\nvaluable species from the forests of Loxa.\r\n\r\nFor the forests of the Peruvian province of Huanuco I procured the\r\nservices of Mr. Pritchett, a gentleman who had passed some years in\r\nSouth America, and who was well acquainted with that particular region.\r\nHe was to collect plants and seeds of the species yielding grey bark.\r\n\r\nI myself undertook to explore the forests either of Caravaya or\r\nBolivia, and to collect the _C. Calisaya_ and other important species\r\nof that more distant region. This part of the enterprise was surrounded\r\nby peculiar difficulties, arising from the jealousy of the people,\r\nhabitual with the Bolivians, and recently excited in the minds of the\r\nPeruvians of Caravaya by the proceedings of M. Hasskarl, the Dutch\r\nagent; while the forests are far more inaccessible, and the journey to\r\nthe coast is longer and more formidable.\r\n\r\nIt was the opinion of Sir William Hooker, who gave me the advantage\r\nof his valuable advice, that a good practical working gardener should\r\naccompany both Mr. Spruce and myself, and he considered this an\r\nimperative requirement, in order that they might attend to the packing\r\nof the plants in the forests, their establishment in Wardian cases, and\r\nhave charge of them during the voyage to India. I appointed Mr. Cross,\r\nat his recommendation, to act under the orders of Mr. Spruce; and Mr.\r\nWeir, who was recommended to me by Mr. Veitch, accompanied me to the\r\nchinchona forests of Caravaya.\r\n\r\nIn employing several agents in districts widely removed from each\r\nother, my chief object was to effect the introduction of as many\r\nvaluable species as possible; but I also reflected on the extreme\r\ndifficulty of the undertaking, and the overwhelming chances against\r\nsuccess which confronted a single-handed attempt. In such wild\r\nunfrequented regions all is uncertainty. Along the dizzy paths of the\r\nAndes a single false step may dash the fairest hopes, disappoint the\r\nmost careful calculations. Add to these dangers the probability of\r\nobstacles raised by the natives, and it will at once be seen that three\r\nindependent expeditions materially increased the chances of ultimate\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nBy the end of 1859 I had completed all the preliminary arrangements;\r\nand there was at length a prospect of securing the successful\r\nintroduction into India of a plant the inestimable value of which had\r\nbeen felt, and the importance of its cultivation discussed, for twenty\r\nyears. On December 17th, 1859, we sailed from England, and, crossing\r\nthe isthmus of Panama, arrived in Lima, the capital of Peru, on January\r\n26th, 1860. Thirty Wardian cases for the plants had been sent out round\r\nCape Horn, and I forwarded fifteen to Guayaquil for Mr. Spruce's\r\ncollection, and fifteen to the port of Islay in Southern Peru, to await\r\nmy return from the chinchona forests. After a month's residence in Lima\r\nwe embarked on board one of the mail-steamers for the southward, and on\r\nthe 2nd of March, 1860, we landed at Islay, which is more conveniently\r\nsituated than any other port for a journey to the chinchona forests of\r\nSouthern Peru or Bolivia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nISLAY AND AREQUIPA.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE port of Islay is the commercial outlet of the departments of\r\nArequipa, Cuzco, and Puno, in Southern Peru; and thus a small town,\r\ndating from about 1830,[118] has risen up on the rocky barren coast,\r\nsurrounded by a sandy desert, and shut in from the interior by a range\r\nof sterile mountains. The coast consists of inaccessible cliffs,\r\nperforated with deep caves by the incessant surge of the ocean, with\r\nseveral rocky islets off the shore. The anchorage[119] is formed by\r\na slight indentation of the coast, and the landing is effected at a\r\nsmall iron jetty clamped to the rocks, under which the swell breaks\r\nand chafes with a ceaseless roar. A very steep path leads up the cliff\r\nto a custom-house, forming one side of the little _plaza_, which is\r\nconstantly filled with droves of mules from the interior. A single\r\nstreet leading up from the plaza, with a few lanes off it, forms the\r\ntown of Islay; and a brief statement of the trade of this port will\r\ngive an idea of the importance of the country to which it forms an\r\noutlet.\r\n\r\nThe principal articles of export are alpaca and sheep's wool, vicuña\r\nwool, copper, bark, and specie; the total value in 1859 being\r\n336,842_l._,[120] and the value of the imports, consisting chiefly of\r\nEuropean goods, is about equal to that of the exports.\r\n\r\nThe country round Islay is as dreary and arid a waste as the eye could\r\nrest on; yet from July to October, when there is the greatest amount of\r\nmoisture on the coast, the otherwise barren mountains, which rise up\r\nabruptly from the desert, at a distance of about three miles from the\r\nsea, are green and carpeted with flowers, while the plain nearer Islay\r\nis also dotted over with vegetation. This maritime range is called\r\nthe \"Lomas.\" In consequence of the unusual quantity of rain which\r\nfell in the early part of 1860, the Lomas had broken out in renewed\r\nfreshness in March. The country, close to Islay, was covered with a\r\nscattered growth of Compositæ, wild tobacco, Nympha, Oxalis, Salvia,\r\nan Umbellifer with a large white flower, Verbena, Heliotrope, a purple\r\nSolanum, an Amaranth, and other flowers. It is broken up into abrupt\r\nravines; and, near the foot of the mountains, some of them contain\r\ndeposits of soil washed down by little streams which flow during the\r\nwet season, sufficient to sustain small groves of fig and olive trees,\r\nthe abodes of numerous flocks of doves. Such is the case in the ravines\r\ncalled Catarindo, Yutu, and Matarani, from the latter of which the\r\nwater is led in pipes to supply the town of Islay. The guardian of this\r\nwater-supply is an Irishman, generally known as Juan de la Pila (John\r\nof the fountain), an active obliging man, who also follows the trades\r\nof carpenter, cooper, and blacksmith; and to whom we were indebted for\r\nmuch valuable assistance in procuring soil for the Wardian cases, and\r\nin giving us the use of his yard.\r\n\r\nThe soil in the richest parts of these ravines, which had been washed\r\ndown from the higher slopes of the Lomas, is several feet deep, and\r\nappeared sufficiently good to be used for the Wardian cases, in the\r\nevent of its being found impossible to obtain soil from any more\r\npromising locality; and the great number of wild flowers which were\r\ngrowing in it convinced me that it could not contain anything very\r\npernicious.[121]\r\n\r\nThe formation consists of granite, with veins of very pure quartz; but\r\nthe plains are covered with large patches of fine dust, consisting\r\nchiefly of silica, containing potash and mica, with small quantities of\r\nthe débris of the rocks associated with the soil, which Admiral FitzRoy\r\nsuggests may have been the ashes ejected, at some remote period, from\r\nthe volcano of Arequipa. Near the sea-shore, and about half a mile\r\nsouth-east of Islay, there is a very curious result of the constant\r\naction of the weaves, in two immense cavities hollowed out of the rock,\r\ncalled the _Tinajones_ (jars). They are circular holes about thirty\r\nyards across, and of great depth, separated from the sea by a wall\r\nof cliffs not more than four yards wide, the lower part of which is\r\nundermined, and forms a passage by which the waves rush into the great\r\n_tinajon_, or bowl, with a mighty roar; and, dashing themselves against\r\nthe rocky sides, throw back clouds of white spray. The only vegetation\r\nnear the coast consists of lowly little _Mesembryanthema_, scattered\r\nabout at long intervals, and an occasional stonecrop (_Sedum_).\r\n\r\nDuring our stay at Islay we enjoyed the hospitality of Mr. Wilthew,\r\nH.B.M. Consul, and his wife, to whom we were indebted for much\r\nthoughtful kindness. The rest of the inhabitants consist of Peruvian\r\nofficials, agents of commercial houses in Arequipa, and a few\r\nshopkeepers and artisans, besides the muleteers and other birds\r\nof passage, and the porters and boatmen of mixed Indian and negro\r\nextraction. The supplies for the market come almost entirely from the\r\nrich valley of Tambo, some leagues down the coast.\r\n\r\nOn March 6th, our mules and horses having arrived, we started for\r\nArequipa in the morning, a distance of ninety miles, and, crossing the\r\ncountry near Islay, entered a gorge in the mountains, which winds up to\r\nthe great desert above, at the commencement of which there is a grove\r\nof dusty olive-trees. This dismal ravine, with arid scarped mountains\r\nrising up on either side, here and there a tall gaunt cactus, and\r\neverywhere a dense cloud of white dust, leads up to a little post-house\r\nbuilt of canes, called the \"Tambo de Guerreros,\" eighteen miles from\r\nIslay.\r\n\r\nGuerreros is at the head of the gorge leading down to Islay; and, from\r\na rising ground a little beyond the tambo,[122] the great desert of\r\nArequipa opens upon the view, bounded by a range of mountains which\r\nare crowned by the snowy peak of the volcano. At this point there is a\r\nwooden cross which marks the grave of a poor soldier belonging to the\r\nfugitive army of Salaverry, in 1836, who, worn out with fatigue and\r\nthirst, had here sunk down to die, and had been lightly covered over\r\nwith sand. The flesh was in perfect preservation. We then entered the\r\ngreat desert of Arequipa, extending to the horizon on the right and\r\nleft, and ending in front at the foot of the rocky range of mountains\r\nseparating the sandy waste from the fertile campiña of Arequipa.\r\nThe desert consists of hard ground, without a blade of vegetation,\r\naffording good riding; but it is covered at short intervals with mounds\r\nof the finest white sand, from twenty to thirty feet high, all in\r\nthe shape of a half-moon, with their horns pointing north-west, and\r\nthus denoting the prevailing wind. They are called _Medanos_. These\r\n_Medanos_ shift their positions, and the breeze, whirling the sand in\r\neddies on their summits, often causes a singing noise in the early\r\ndawn. Frequently they form athwart the road, which has to deviate in\r\na half-circle, and rejoin the old track on the other side; but they\r\nall resemble each other exactly, and afford no landmark to the lost or\r\nbenighted traveller.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the desert is the post-house or tambo of La Joya,\r\ntwenty miles from Guerreros, kept by an Englishman, whose homely name\r\nof Jimmy Eyres has been converted into the more grandiloquent and\r\neuphonious Spanish one of Don Santiago Casimiro de los Ayres. Water\r\nand fodder for the beasts are brought from a great distance, and their\r\nprice is of course proportionately high; but, considering its position\r\nin the midst of a desert and many leagues from all supplies, the little\r\ntambo, consisting of several rooms of deal planking roughly knocked\r\ntogether, was very comfortable.\r\n\r\nStarting at four on a bright starlight morning, the perfect stillness\r\nand the wild grandeur of the boundless desert were very impressive,\r\nwhile there was a delicious freshness in the cool air. As the sun rose\r\nbehind the mighty cordilleras which bounded the view, the whiteness\r\nof their snowy peaks became quite dazzling. Immediately in front was\r\nthe perfect cone of the volcano of Arequipa; to the right the glorious\r\npeaks of Charcani and Chuquibamba; to the left the remarkable range of\r\nPichupichu. It is probable that in no part of the world is so sublime a\r\nview of mountain peaks to be found as is presented at early dawn from\r\nthis desert. But its sublimity is similar to that which is witnessed\r\nin a sunrise at sea; it fills the mind with an idea of vastness and\r\ngrandeur, while it wants all the details which usually accompany and\r\nform no small part of the enjoyment derived from ordinary mountain\r\nscenery. Yet here, while gazing on those magnificent peaks, with no\r\nmiddle distance and no foreground, save the flat sea-like wilderness,\r\nwe felt that any addition would have marred the simple glories of this\r\nunparalleled view. The desert is between 4000 and 5000 feet above the\r\nsea, and the cordillera peaks are, some more, some a little less, than\r\n20,000 feet in height; so that, within a distance of under forty miles,\r\nwe beheld mountains rising upwards of 16,000 feet from the point on\r\nwhich we stood: of no other mountains in the world could such a view be\r\nobtained. In this land of the Incas Nature has done her work on a truly\r\ngigantic scale.\r\n\r\nThe desert, from Guerreros to the entrance to the gorge leading through\r\nthe rocky hills which divide it from the plain of Arequipa, is upwards\r\nof forty miles across, while its length from the transverse valley of\r\nTambo to that of Vitor must be about sixty. During the greater part of\r\nthe day we were threading our way through arid mountain gorges, and\r\nup and down zigzag rocky paths strewn with the bones and carcasses\r\nof mules, under a scorching sun. A little pale purple _Nemophila_, a\r\nsmall _Crucifer_, and the weird _Cacti_, the appropriate inhabitants\r\nof the desert, are the only plants of this cheerless region; and a few\r\nobscene gallinazos, floating lazily in the upper air, with their\r\nkeen-piercing eyes watching for some luckless mule to sink under its\r\nburden, were the sole representatives of animal life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AREQUIPA. Page 75.]\r\n\r\nAt length our eyes were gladdened by the sight of the green vale of\r\nTiavaya, in the campiña of Arequipa. The rows of tall willows, the\r\nbright green fields of lucerne, and white farm-houses, were a blessed\r\nrelief after the monotonous glare of barren rocks and sand; but it was\r\nnot until late at night, and after a ride of more than fifty miles,\r\nthat we reached our hospitable lodging in the city of Arequipa.\r\n\r\nArequipa, the second city in Peru, is built on the banks of the rapid\r\nriver Chile, and at the foot of the great volcano, called Misti, which\r\nrises up in a perfect cone to the height of 17,934 feet, its upper half\r\ncovered with snow. Arequipa itself is 7427 feet above the sea, so that\r\nthe mountains ascend in one unbroken sweep upwards of 10,500 feet. The\r\nclimate, during my stay from March 11th to March 22nd, was as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Mean temperature        64-1/3\r\n  Mean minimum at night   60-1/2\r\n  Highest observed        67\r\n  Lowest                  58\r\n  Range                    9\r\n\r\nThe town is built of a white stone of volcanic origin, being a\r\ntrachytic tuffa containing pumice and lava, dug out of quarries at\r\nthe foot of the volcano. The houses are usually of one story, built\r\nsolidly and substantially, with vaulted stone ceilings, the better to\r\nresist the shocks of the frequent earthquakes. Like almost all Spanish\r\nAmerican cities, the streets are straight and at right angles to each\r\nother, with an _azequia_ flowing down the centre. Wheeled vehicles\r\nof any description are unknown, and the traffic consists of horses,\r\ndroves of mules, donkeys laden with lucerne, and flocks of llamas. The\r\nprincipal streets all lead to the great square, which forms a busy\r\nand most interesting scene in the morning, the time for marketing. It\r\nis then filled with gaily-dressed Indian women, some sitting under\r\nshades, with their goods spread out on the ground before them, and\r\nothers, in constant movement, threading their way amongst the sellers.\r\nTheir dresses are of baize, manufactured at Halifax,[123] of the gayest\r\ncolours--consisting of a skirt and mantle of the two most brilliant\r\ncolours they can find, red and blue, green and crimson, or purple and\r\norange. The effect of these bright-coloured groups, in constant motion,\r\nas they move about buying fruit or vegetables, potatoes, earth-nuts,\r\nmedicinal drugs, corn, articles of dress, and other necessaries, is\r\nvery pleasing. The background is formed by the handsome new cathedral\r\nof whitest stone, behind which the noble volcano, and the peaks of\r\nCharcani (18,558 feet above the sea) dazzle the eyes by the brilliancy\r\nof their snowy covering.\r\n\r\nThe campiña of Arequipa, which surrounds the city, is about five miles\r\nbroad from the foot of the cordillera to the arid range of hills which\r\nseparates it from the wilderness of the coast; and about ten or twelve\r\nmiles long, being bounded at each end by a sandy desert. It is watered\r\nby the river Chile,[124] coming from a chasm in the cordillera, on the\r\nnorth-west side of the volcano, and by the streams called Posterio and\r\nSavandia, which flow from the Pichu-pichu mountains to the eastward\r\nof the volcano. These several streams unite on leaving the campiña,\r\nand finally fall into the river of Quilca. The campiña contains,\r\nbesides the city of Arequipa, a number of small villages, and numerous\r\nfarm-houses. In March the view from the hills above the city is most\r\nbeautiful. The brilliant green of the campiña, with its fields of maize\r\nand alfalfa, its rows of tall willows, and orchards of fruit-trees,\r\nis dotted with houses and villages, while it forms an emerald\r\nsetting to the white city. Looking from the other side of Arequipa,\r\nthe view, though not so beautiful, is more imposing: the snow-capped\r\nvolcano rearing its majestic head above the stunted towers of the\r\ntown. There is a great deal of maize grown in the valley, and guano is\r\nextensively used as manure; but the wealth of the campiña is chiefly\r\nderived from its mules, which monopolize the carrying-trade from the\r\ncoast to Arequipa, and from Arequipa to the interior. A quantity of\r\nlucerne or _alfalfa_ is raised for their sustenance, and the _arrieros_\r\nor muleteers are a wealthy class of men, generally possessing a\r\n_chacra_ or farm of their own, besides considerable sums in ready\r\nmoney. They are, as a rule, good-looking, well-grown men, with fresh\r\ncomplexions, and little mixed blood, which is also made evident by the\r\ncomparatively fair complexions of their wives and daughters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AREQUIPA CATHEDRAL. From a Photograph. Page 76.]\r\n\r\nThe families of the upper classes of Arequipa usually own estates in\r\nthe neighbouring warm valleys of the coast, such as Vitor, Tambo,\r\nSiguas, Majes, and Camana, where the rich vineyards yield them a\r\nprofitable return by the sale of aguardiente. Their houses in the\r\ncity are built round a _patio_ or courtyard, on which the principal\r\nrooms open. Their sons are frequently the leaders of the turbulent\r\n_Cholos_ in revolt, and follow the professions of _abogados_, lawyers\r\nor politicians, traders, and _haciendados_ or farmers, while the more\r\nambitious adopt a military life, the _carrera de armas_. The ladies are\r\nconsidered the most beautiful and intelligent in Peru, and, at Lima,\r\nthe most attractive women are usually Arequipeñas. Perhaps the majority\r\nhave never moved beyond the campiña, and adjacent warm valleys, and\r\nmany have never seen the sea. Yet they are sprightly and agreeable in\r\nsociety, full of intelligent curiosity, and almost invariably excellent\r\nmusicians. They frequently sing the plaintive _despedidas_, and other\r\nsonnets of their native poet Melgar, whose love for a fair townswoman\r\nwas unrequited, and whose melancholy fate has surrounded his name with\r\na halo of romance. He was barbarously shot, after having been taken\r\nprisoner by the Spaniards, at the battle of Umachiri in 1815, the first\r\nattempt which the Peruvians made for their independence.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter months the wealthier families remove to villages in\r\nthe campiña, either to Tingo, Tiavaya, or Savandia, taking furniture\r\nwith them. At the commencement of the season droves of mules leave\r\nthe city laden with beds, chairs, and tables, to render the country\r\nhouses habitable. Here the Arequipeños enjoy the delights of the\r\ncountry and of bathing in large swimming-baths faced with masonry,\r\nand planted round with rows of tall willows. The rides in the country\r\nwhich surrounds these villages are exceedingly pretty. The trees\r\nconsist chiefly of tall willows and of the _Schinus molle_ with its\r\nbunches of red berries, while bushes of fragrant white _Daturas_ and\r\nof the beautiful _Bignonia fulva_ fill the hedges, and the streams\r\nare bordered by masses of _Nasturtiums_. The fields either bear crops\r\nof vivid green alfalfa, or tall Indian corn, six to eight feet high,\r\nover which the _Tropæolum canariensis_ creeps in golden masses, and at\r\nwhose feet the bright blue _lupins_, and a _Solanum_ with rich purple\r\nflowers, grow as weeds. From many points of view the rapid waters of\r\nthe river Chile complete the picture, while far away the snowy peaks\r\nof Chuquibamba, Charcani, and the volcano glisten in the beams of the\r\nsun. Above Arequipa the river flows through the valley of Chilinos,\r\nthe steep sides of which are lined with _andeneria_, or terraced\r\nmaize-gardens, with here and there a picturesque group of the stone\r\nhuts of the Indians, often completely hidden by the dark green leaves\r\nand golden flowers of the gourds which cover them. The courtyards of\r\nthe houses are frequently ornamented with a beautiful passion-flower,\r\nwhich creeps over the trellised verandahs, and is covered with flowers.\r\nIt is a species of _Tacsonia_, called by the natives _tumbo_. The\r\nflower has a very long tube, and is of a deep rich rose-colour: and a\r\ndelicious _fresco_, or sherbet, is made of the egg-shaped fruit.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the baths of pure spring-water at Tingo and Savandia,\r\nthe medicinal baths of Yura are a great resort during the winter\r\nmonths. Yura is thirty miles to the north-west, and is situated,\r\nlike Arequipa, just under the range of the cordilleras. The road\r\nleads over very broken ground, where the rugged spurs from the Andes\r\nproject out into the desert. In March the weary arid wilderness was\r\nenlivened by wild flowers, bushes of yellow and purple _Solanums_,\r\nbright orange _Compositæ_, and, in one place, a carpet of little purple\r\ndwarf iris. The baths are in a green ravine, with tall willow-trees\r\nand maize-fields, watered by a little rivulet. In this narrow glen,\r\nbounded on one side by sandstone mountains, which here form the base\r\nof the volcano, and on the other by a ridge of trachyte, there are\r\ntwo places where thermal waters bubble out of the rocks, one being\r\nferruginous and the other sulphurous. At the sulphurous baths there\r\nare some solid stone buildings, intended as lodgings for the bathers,\r\nwith heavy arcades, and long vaulted rooms with no windows, and without\r\nfurniture, for, as at Tingo and Savandia, all visitors bring their\r\nbeds, tables, chairs, crockery, and cooking utensils with them. In the\r\nbath-room there are four square basins, faced with stone, of different\r\ntemperatures, and called the _Vejeto_ (87° Fahr.), the _Desague_ (88°),\r\nthe _Sepultura_ (89°), and the _Tigre_ (90°). They are said to cure\r\ndysentery, rheumatism, and cutaneous diseases. The rivulet flows down\r\nthe glen and joins the river of Yura near a village called Calera,\r\nwhere most of the soap is manufactured which is consumed in Arequipa.\r\nGreat quantities of carbonate of soda are collected from the sandstone\r\nrock, which gives employment to the people of the village. The land is\r\ndivided into _topos_ (5000 square yards), each valued at a thousand\r\ndollars, and every six weeks a harvest of _salitre_ (carbonate of soda)\r\nis reaped. From Calera there is a fine view of the green valley of\r\nYura, and of a grand range of porphyritic mountains.\r\n\r\nThe population of the campiña and town of Arequipa is reckoned at about\r\n50,000.[125] The place was first colonized by the Inca Mayta, who\r\nestablished a body of _mitimaes_ or colonists there, from the village\r\nof Cavanilla, near Puno, and ordained that they should remain and\r\nsettle there. Hence the name \"_Ari quepay_,\" \"Yes! remain:\" or more\r\nprobably it is derived from the words \"_Aric quepa_,\" \"Behind the sharp\r\npeak.\" These _mitimaes_ were the ancestors of the present Indians,\r\nor _Cholos_ as they are called, and were established in villages in\r\nthe campiña, occupied in the cultivation of maize; but the city is\r\npurely Spanish, and was founded by Pizarro in 1540, at which time the\r\nstone-quarries first began to be worked.\r\n\r\nThe _Cholos_ or Indians of Arequipa have long been notorious for their\r\nturbulence, and for the eagerness with which they join any attempt\r\nat revolution, apparently from mere love of excitement. They are\r\naddicted to the use of _chicha_--a fermented liquor made from Indian\r\ncorn--to such an extent that it is said that nearly all the maize which\r\nis raised in the campiña is used in brewing this liquor; under the\r\ninfluence of which the Cholos have established the fame of Arequipa as\r\nthe grand focus of Peruvian revolutions. But this habit of drinking to\r\nexcess has rendered the Cholos, though capable of fighting desperately\r\nbehind walls, quite worthless as soldiers in a campaign; and their\r\nhabit of body becomes so bad that a slight wound is frequently fatal.\r\n\r\nThough the received idea in Europe, that Peru is constantly in a state\r\nof civil war, is erroneous in fact, as well as unjust,[126] yet it is\r\ntrue that the period of tranquillity which had lasted from 1844 to\r\n1854 was broken in the latter year by the successful revolution of\r\nGeneral Castilla--the result of the discontent caused by the dishonest\r\nfinancial measures and the embezzlements of his predecessor; and two\r\nyears afterwards the Cholos of Arequipa commenced a rebellion against\r\nCastilla. A brief account of the siege of that city, which followed,\r\nwill give a good idea of the endurance and fighting qualities of the\r\nCholos.\r\n\r\nIn October 1856 two young men of good family, named Gamio and Masias,\r\ncollected a handful of Cholos, and sent a message to the Prefect\r\nCanseco, telling him that he must either evacuate the city with his\r\ntroops, or lay down his arms. The prefect marched out, and left\r\nArequipa in the hands of the insurgents, who proclaimed the exiled\r\nGeneral Vivanco President of Peru, and appointed Don José Antonio\r\nBerenguel prefect of the town; and most of the soldiers who had\r\nmarched out with Canseco returned on the following day to join the\r\nrebels. Vivanco was an exile in Chile, but, on receiving the news, he\r\nstarted for Islay by the English mail steamer, and reached Arequipa\r\nin December; while General San Roman, who had been sent from Lima\r\nto propose terms of accommodation with the rebels, was dismissed,\r\nand retired into the interior to collect forces for the support of\r\nCastilla's government.\r\n\r\nWhile the Cholos of Arequipa were maturing their rebellion, a fortunate\r\nevent placed the Peruvian navy at the disposal of Vivanco. Their\r\nlargest frigate, the 'Apurimac,' was lying off Arica, and, while her\r\ncaptain, a rough old Chilian seaman named Salcedo, was on shore, the\r\ncrew, led by Lizardo Montero, one of her lieutenants, a young man and\r\nnative of Piura, mutinied, declared for Vivanco, and steamed away,\r\nleaving Salcedo storming on the beach. The 'Apurimac' went at once to\r\nIslay, where Montero captured the port, and where he was joined by two\r\nsmaller steamers, the 'Loa' and 'Tumbez.'\r\n\r\nVivanco, meanwhile, had proclaimed himself \"Regenerator\" of Peru,\r\nand offered his services as a lawgiver and restorer of prosperity to\r\nhis country, which were not accepted or appreciated, as none of the\r\nother great towns followed the example of Arequipa. Leaving a ministry\r\nconsisting of young inexperienced lawyers, who had nothing to lose and\r\nall to gain, in charge of affairs at Arequipa, he embarked on board the\r\n'Apurimac,' in the end of December, 1856, and sailed for Callao, but\r\ndid not venture to disembark. He then went on board the 'Loa,' leaving\r\nthe 'Apurimac' to watch Callao, and proceeded to Truxillo; while the\r\n'Apurimac' went down to the Chincha Islands, and began shipping off the\r\nguano to any one who would buy it, thus leaving the port of Callao open.\r\n\r\nGeneral Castilla is an old Indian, possessed of great military talent\r\nand extraordinary energy and intrepidity; while Vivanco is a native of\r\nLima, of pure Spanish descent, indolent, dilatory, and without personal\r\ncourage; but eloquent and persuasive, and possessed of qualities which\r\nhave surrounded him with numerous warm partisans and personal friends.\r\nBetween such men the issue could not be doubtful.\r\n\r\nThe veteran Castilla, as soon as the 'Apurimac' had sailed for the\r\nChincha Islands, formed the daring plan of attacking his enemy in the\r\nnorth; and, in spite of the Navy, which had declared against him,\r\nhe bought an old steamer, the 'Santiago,' belonging to the English\r\nSteam Navigation Company, and boldly steamed away in search of the\r\nRegenerator. On hearing of his approach, Vivanco was seized with a\r\npanic, and, evacuating the places he had occupied, retreated to his\r\nships. He now thought that, in the absence of Castilla, he might\r\nsucceed in an attempt on the capital, and, collecting all his vessels,\r\nhe retraced his steps southward, and arrived in Callao bay on April\r\n22nd, 1857. A night attack was then made on the fort, but, after some\r\nhard street fighting, Vivanco's party were obliged to retire to their\r\nships; and, his expedition having proved a complete failure, the\r\nRegenerator returned to Islay, and proceeded at once to Arequipa.\r\n\r\nWhile Vivanco was absent in the north, General San Roman had collected\r\na considerable force in the interior, with which he marched towards\r\nArequipa. The warlike Cholos came out to meet him, and a skirmish\r\nfollowed, which they call the battle of Yumina. It consisted of a\r\nconsiderable waste of powder, the two parties firing at each other,\r\nat very long ranges, across a ravine; and in the afternoon the\r\nCholos returned in triumph to Arequipa. Having missed Vivanco in the\r\nnorth, old Don Ramon Castilla steamed away to Arica in the same old\r\n'Santiago,' safely passing the rebellious fleet at Islay, collected\r\na force at Tacna, and, marching by land, arrived in the campiña\r\nof Arequipa in the end of July; soon afterwards establishing his\r\nhead-quarters at the village of Sachaca, some miles below the city, on\r\nthe banks of the river Chile. A detachment occupied Tiavaya, to cut off\r\nVivanco's communication with Islay.\r\n\r\nThe people of Arequipa were now hard at work to place the city in a\r\nproper state of defence; barricades were erected in the most important\r\nstreets, and day and night the Cholos were under arms. But, supplies\r\nhaving now entirely ceased from the custom-house at Islay, Vivanco\r\nfound himself in great difficulties; for people, having little faith\r\nin the success of his revolution, were unwilling to advance money in\r\nexchange for his _vales_ or promissory notes, even at a discount of\r\nfifty per cent. The needy Regenerator then resorted to more violent\r\nmethods of raising money, and, breaking open several of the principal\r\nshops, began to sell their contents to the highest bidder.\r\n\r\nCastilla made constant sham attacks upon the town, which kept the\r\ninhabitants in a continual state of alarm; but all his supplies were\r\nderived from Arica, by way of Tacna, as the port of Islay remained in\r\nthe hands of Vivanco's party. This was his weak point; and when the\r\n'Apurimac' arrived off Arica, and her commander Montero, after a sharp\r\nstreet fight, got possession of that port in February, 1858, Castilla\r\nfound himself in a position of great difficulty. His supplies were\r\nentirely cut off, and it became necessary for him to assault Arequipa\r\nat all hazards. Accordingly he moved from his quarters at Sachaca\r\nand Tiavaya, marched round the south side of the city, and early in\r\nthe morning of March 5th, 1858, commenced an attack on the eastern\r\nsuburbs. His troops first stormed the church of San Antonio, and then\r\nadvanced to the attack of San Pedro, which had also been occupied by\r\nthe besieged. Here the Cholos held their ground for four hours, from\r\neight to twelve A.M., in spite of the desperate attacks of Castilla's\r\nbest troops, and the well-directed fire of his artillery. At length,\r\noverpowered by numbers, they were forced to retire, disputing every\r\ninch of the ground. They rallied at the convent of Santa Rosa, and\r\nobstinately defended the position for several hours, until night\r\nclosed in upon the combatants. Next morning, being the 7th of March,\r\nsome further resistance was made, but the troops of Castilla finally\r\nstormed the barricades, and drove everything before them. Vivanco\r\nescaped in the disguise of a friar to Islay, and thence to Chile, while\r\nhis officers looked after themselves, leaving the gallant defenders\r\nof Arequipa to their fate. Tacna and Arica at once returned to their\r\nallegiance, and the 'Apurimac' was given up to Castilla's ministers at\r\nLima by the mutinous Montero.\r\n\r\nThe Cholos of Arequipa thus defended their position, with great bravery\r\nand resolution, against Castilla's disciplined army for upwards of\r\neight months; and during the assault, which lasted for two days, their\r\ndesperate valour was as remarkable as their extraordinary endurance,\r\nfor, such was the negligence of Vivanco and his officers, that they\r\nwere kept without refreshment or even water during the many hours in\r\nwhich they sustained a deadly and unequal struggle against Castilla's\r\ntroops. It should also be recorded to their credit, that, although the\r\ntown was on several occasions entirely in their hands, there was no\r\ninstance of any act of pillage or excess being committed by them; and,\r\nwhen all authority was withdrawn, they showed no disposition to take\r\nadvantage of their power, but displayed a regard for order which would\r\nnot be found among the lower orders of most other countries during\r\nperiods of great excitement.\r\n\r\nThere is a very striking difference, however, between the Cholos of\r\nArequipa and the Inca Indians of the interior, who appear in the\r\nstreets with their llamas laden with silky vicuña-wool: the former a\r\nturbulent, excitable race, who will fight desperately behind walls, but\r\nwho are without stamina and quite unable to endure fatigue; the latter\r\na patient, long-suffering people, capable of extraordinary endurance,\r\nand, as soldiers, in the habit of marching distances which appear\r\nincredible to those whose experience is confined to the movements of\r\nEuropean troops. There is an evident mixture of Spanish blood in the\r\npeople who inhabit Arequipa and its campiña, while the Indians of the\r\ninterior are for the most part of pure descent.\r\n\r\nThe road over the cordilleras to Cuzco and Puno leaves Arequipa by\r\nthe southern suburb, and, after a few miles, ascends a rocky ridge to\r\nthe more elevated valley of Chihuata or Cangallo (9676 feet above the\r\nsea[127]), at the foot of the southern spur of the volcano. A wretched\r\nstone hut with a mud floor is here the only shelter for the traveller.\r\nAt one end a fire of sticks, where an old hag acted as cook, filled the\r\ninterior with smoke, and at the other each wayfarer, as he arrived,\r\nmade a shakedown of blankets and ponchos, sipped his chocolate, and,\r\nafter a short conversation, composed himself for the night. The fire\r\ngradually smouldered and went out, and the old woman, with a brood of\r\nchildren, made a heap at the further corner.\r\n\r\nAt early dawn of the 23rd of March we were all in motion, and our\r\ncompanion of the previous night, a Spaniard with a large _tropa_ of\r\nmules laden with aguardiente, was busily preparing for a start. As the\r\nsun rose, the dazzling white of the snowy peaks of Pichu-pichu and\r\nthe volcano, with fleecy clouds above their summits, gave a glorious\r\neffect. The rest of the sky was blue, gradually clouding over as the\r\nmorning advanced; and the valley was covered with alfalfa-fields of the\r\nrichest green, with the pretty little village of Cachimarca perched on\r\na rounded hill to the southward. The flowering shrubs by the roadside\r\nare the same as in the campiña of Arequipa, except that a small yellow\r\nCalceolaria is more abundant. The morning air was fresh and bracing as\r\nwe mounted our mules and faced the long zigzag path up the \"alto de los\r\nhuesos,\" the southern spur of the volcano, so called from the bones of\r\nthousands of mules which are met at every turn. This ascent conducts\r\nthe traveller from the temperate valley of Cangallo to the bleak and\r\nchilling plains of the upper cordillera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CHOLO OF AREQUIPA. From a Photograph See page 80.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nJOURNEY ACROSS THE CORDILLERA TO PUNO.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the region of the cordillera of the Andes, in Northern and Central\r\nPeru, the country is broken up into deep warm valleys and profound\r\nravines, separated by lofty precipitous ridges and snowy peaks, which\r\ncombine to form some of the most magnificent scenery in the world.\r\nVast flocks of sheep and alpacas find pasture on the upland slopes,\r\nwhile abundance of wheat is grown lower down. Indian corn generally\r\nflourishes at a still lower elevation, though it is grown as high\r\nas 13,000 feet on the islands of lake Titicaca, and sugar-cane is\r\ncultivated in the deep valleys. This is the nature of the country\r\nbetween Ayacucho and Cuzco, and in the valley of Vilcamayu, which\r\nextends from the foot of the Vilcañota range until it subsides into the\r\nvast tropical plains to the north and east of Cuzco.\r\n\r\nBut the southern part of the interior of Peru, and the northern portion\r\nof Bolivia, present a very different character. From the Vilcañota\r\nmountains the Andes separate into two distinct chains, namely, the\r\ncordillera or coast-range, and the Eastern Andes, which include the\r\nloftiest peaks in South America, Illimani and Sorata, or Illampu. The\r\nregion between these two ranges contains the great lake of Titicaca,\r\nand consists of elevated plains intersected by rivers flowing into\r\nthe lake, at a height never less than 12,000 feet above the sea. The\r\nmagnificent scenery of Northern and Central Peru is wanting in this\r\nsouthern part of the country, which composes the department of Puno,\r\nand is usually called the _Collao_. It, however, possesses features of\r\nits own which are at once striking and imposing, while the land which\r\nis drained by the lake of Titicaca was the cradle of the civilization\r\nof the Incas.\r\n\r\nThe journey up the \"Alto de los huesos\" is very fatiguing, and the\r\nchange from the pleasant exhilarating air of Chihuata, to the chilling\r\nicy blasts which constantly sweep over the upper region of the\r\ncordillera, was severely felt. As the afternoon advanced a drizzling\r\nmist came on, and added to the cheerless desolation of the plains\r\nit was necessary to traverse before reaching the post-house of Apo.\r\nOccasionally a drove of llamas, with their Indian driver, loomed for a\r\nmoment through the mist, and at nightfall we arrived at the post-house\r\nof Apo (14,350 feet), tired, drenched, and cold.\r\n\r\nThe rainy season of the cordilleras commences in November, and\r\ncontinues until the end of March, and during most of that time the\r\ndiscomfort of travelling is so great, and the rivers so swollen, that\r\na journey is seldom undertaken by an ordinary traveller. In March,\r\nhowever, the rain does not fall continuously or in any quantity. The\r\nearly morning is generally clear, but in the afternoon mists, rain, or\r\nsnow begin to fall, and continue until far into the night. From April\r\nuntil October is the dry season, and in May, June, July, and August a\r\ncloud is scarcely ever seen in the sky.\r\n\r\nThe post-houses in the desolate mountains between Arequipa and Puno\r\nare all of the same character. They consist of a range of low stone\r\nbuildings surrounding a courtyard on three sides, and consisting of\r\nfive or six rooms with mud floors, a rough table, and a platform of\r\nstone and mud at one end, which is intended for a bed-place. The roof\r\nis badly tiled or thatched, and the doors are so roughly fitted that\r\nit is impossible to close them. Both man and beast are subject to a\r\nmost distressing illness, caused by the rarefaction of the air at\r\nthese great altitudes, which is called _sorochi_ by the Peruvians. I\r\nhad suffered from a sharp attack of illness at Arequipa, so that I was\r\nprobably predisposed to a visitation from _sorochi_, which I certainly\r\nendured to its fullest extent. Before arriving at Apo, a violent\r\npressure on the head, accompanied by acute pain, and aches in the back\r\nof the neck, caused great discomfort, and these symptoms increased in\r\nintensity during the night at the Apo post-house, so that at three\r\nA.M., when we recommenced our journey, I was unable to mount my mule\r\nwithout assistance.\r\n\r\nA ride of seven hours across grassy plains covered with herbage, with\r\npatches of snow here and there, and ranges of hills with fine masses\r\nof rocks, forming a setting to the distant peaks of the cordillera,\r\nbrought us to the post-house of Pati. During this ride we had to ford\r\nthe river, which flows past Arequipa as the Chile, more than a dozen\r\ntimes. The only living creatures are the _lecca-leccas_, a bird which\r\nfrequents the numerous streams, and the graceful flocks of vicuñas.\r\nThe _lecca-lecca_ is a large plover, with red legs, white head, grey\r\nbody, white under the breast and tail, and wings and tail broadly edged\r\nwith black. It incessantly utters a wild shrill scream. The vicuñas, a\r\nspecies of llama with the habits of an antelope, are very beautiful and\r\ngraceful creatures. They have rich fawn-coloured coats, with patches\r\nof white across the shoulders and inside the legs, and long slender\r\nnecks. They are constantly met with in the most desolate parts of the\r\ncordillera, browsing on the tender shoots of the tufts of _ychu_, or\r\ngalloping along with their noses close to the ground, as if they were\r\nscenting out the best pasture.\r\n\r\nAt Pati a range of abrupt porphyritic cliffs rises from the plain, up\r\nwhich a rough zigzag pass leads to the \"Pampa de Confital,\"[128] the\r\nloftiest part of the road over this pass of the cordillera. A storm of\r\nhail began to fall, which turned into snow as we reached the pampa, and\r\na ride of many hours over a succession of wild desolate plains, in an\r\nincessant snow-storm, brought us to the \"alto de Toledo,\" the highest\r\npart of the road, and 15,590 feet above the level of the sea.[129]\r\nSome glorious snowy peaks appeared through the gloom at sunset, and\r\nafter several weary hours in the darkness we at length arrived at the\r\npost-house of Cuevillas.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Cuevillas there are large sheep-farms, one\r\ncalled Toroya, near the \"alto de Toledo,\" and another called Tincopalca\r\nfarther on. The sheep, at this enormous height, lamb in March and July,\r\nand, of the March lambs, usually about fifty per cent. survive. Beyond\r\nCuevillas there are two large Alpine lakes, whence a river flows down\r\ninto Titicaca, and we thus passed the watershed between the Pacific\r\nand the great lake. The scenery is grand and desolate, reminding me,\r\nin some respects, of the interior of Cornwallis Island in the Arctic\r\nregions. The road passes between the two lakes, and we reached the\r\npost-house of La Compuerta as the afternoon rain commenced. The hills\r\nare covered with tufts of coarse grass (_Stipa ychu_), of which the\r\nllamas eat the upper blades, while the sheep browse on the tender\r\nshoots underneath; and with two kinds of shrubby plants, one a thorny\r\n_composita_ called _ccanlli_, and the other called _tola_ or _ccapo_,\r\nwhich is a resinous _Baccharis_,[130] and is used for fuel.[131]\r\n\r\nThe gorge in which the La Compuerta post-house is situated is the only\r\noutlet for the waters of the lake. Mountains of great height rise up\r\non either side, clothed, at this season, with herbage of the richest\r\ngreen, while ridges of scarped cliffs of dark porphyritic rock crop\r\nout at intervals. The river dashes noisily over huge boulders, and\r\nnear its left bank are the rough stone buildings of the post-house.\r\nGreat quantities of ducks, gulls, coots, godwits, and sandpipers\r\nfrequent the shores of the lake. The postmaster supplied _alfalfa_ for\r\nthe mules, and a _chupé_ consisting of potatoes and salt mutton for\r\nthe travellers, at exorbitant prices; the mules were freed from their\r\ncargoes, which were placed within the porch, ready lashed up in their\r\n_redecillas_ or hide nets; and we were soon rolled up in blankets and\r\nponchos, while the snow continued to fall unceasingly through the early\r\npart of the night. When we got up next morning the thermometer was at\r\n31° Fahr. indoors.\r\n\r\nStarting at dawn, we descended the gorge, passing two ruined mining\r\nestablishments, San Ramon and Santa Lucia, into green plains with large\r\nflocks of sheep scattered over them.\r\n\r\nIn these uninhabited wilds it is an event to meet a traveller, and his\r\nappearance is the signal for a succession of questions and answers. We\r\nhere passed a _cavallero_, in whose dress and general appearance we\r\nsaw a reflection of our own, excepting the comforters. He wore a large\r\nponcho of bright colours, reaching nearly to his heels; a broad-brimmed\r\nfelt hat with a blue cotton handkerchief passed over it, and tied in\r\na knot under his chin; an immense woollen comforter passed round his\r\nthroat and face, until nothing appeared but his eyes; a pair of woollen\r\ngaiters, bright green, with black stripes; and huge spurs. He was an\r\nofficer on his way to Arequipa, and complained of the severity of the\r\nweather and the heaviness of the roads. After a short conversation the\r\ntraveller passed on, followed by his cargo-mules, and soon became a\r\nspeck in the distance.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we came to the first signs of cultivation, since\r\nleaving the valley of Cangallo, in the neighbourhood of the great\r\nsheep-farm of Taya-taya--patches of quinoa, barley, and potatoes, with\r\nthe huts of Indians scattered amongst them; and, crossing a rocky\r\nridge, we came in sight of a vast swampy plain, with the little town\r\nof Vilque, at the foot of a fine rocky height, in the far distance,\r\nwhich we reached at sunset. The long rows of thatched brown huts\r\ndripping with rain, and the muddy streets, looked melancholy. But at\r\nthe time of the great fair, in June, Vilque presents a very different\r\nappearance. The plains, for several miles beyond this little town,\r\nwere so swampy as to be rendered almost impassable. It was with the\r\ngreatest difficulty that we made our way across them, constantly wading\r\nand splashing through water, and in some places sinking so deep in the\r\nadhesive mud, that it was not without desperate exertions that the\r\nmules could extricate themselves. At length we came to a rocky ridge\r\nwhich bounded the vast pampa of Vilque, and continued our journey over\r\nrather drier ground.\r\n\r\nSince leaving La Compuerta we had been continually descending; the\r\nvicuñas had disappeared, as they confine themselves to the loftiest\r\nand wildest parts of the cordillera; but, in the lower region between\r\nVilque and Puno, the feeling of desolation and solitude is dissipated\r\nby the numbers of birds which enliven the country, and by the increased\r\nquantity and variety of wild flowers.\r\n\r\nThe _lecca-leccas_ or plovers were very numerous, screaming shrilly\r\nas they flew in circles, or ran along the ground. In the clefts of\r\nthe rocks there were many birds, like creepers, called _haccacllo_ by\r\nthe Indians, and _pito_ in Spanish--beaks curved downwards, black on\r\nthe top of the head, white underneath, red at the back of the neck,\r\nspeckled wings, white breast, and a black line from the beak to the\r\nback of the neck. We also saw many small green paroquets, bright yellow\r\nfinches called _silgaritos_, a kind of partridge called _yutu_, and,\r\nabove all, the glorious _coraquenque_ or _alcamari_, the royal bird of\r\nthe Incas, whose black and white wing-feathers surmounted the imperial\r\n_llautu_ or fringe of the sovereigns of Peru. The _alcamari_ is a\r\nlarge and noble-looking bird of prey, with a scarlet head, black body,\r\nand long wing-feathers of spotless white. Wherever the plains are\r\nintersected by ridges of rocky cliffs, which is frequently the case,\r\nthere are swarms of large rodents, called _biscaches_, which sat on\r\ntheir hind legs, and looked about inquisitively as we rode past.\r\n\r\nRiding over several wide grassy plains, and passing the village of\r\nTiquillaca, we arrived at the banks of the river Tortorani, which was\r\nso swollen as to be quite impassable. By following its course for\r\nabout half a mile, we came to a place where the whole volume of water\r\nprecipitates itself down a sheer declivity of 250 feet, and forms a\r\nmagnificent cascade. A league below the falls we found a bridge, and,\r\nat sunset, we came in sight of the great lake of Titicaca, with the\r\nsnowy range beyond. A steep zigzag descent leads down to the city of\r\nPuno, which is close to the shores of the lake, and hemmed in by an\r\namphitheatre of argentiferous mountains.\r\n\r\nPuno, the capital of the department, owes its origin and former\r\nprosperity to the rich veins of silver-ore in the surrounding country.\r\nIt is approached, from the north, by a stone archway built over the\r\nroad by General Deustua, who was prefect in 1850; and the streets\r\nslope by a gradual descent towards the lake. The houses are built\r\nof small-sized brown _adobes_, with roofs of thatch or red tiles,\r\nand courtyards very neatly paved with round pebbles and llama's\r\nknuckle-bones in patterns. There are scarcely any with more than a\r\nground-floor, and the rooms open on to the court; but, though at this\r\nelevation, 12,874 feet above the sea, it is extremely cold at night,\r\nstoves are unknown; and the unusual luxury of a fireplace, which exists\r\nin one house, is merely a luxury to the eye, for it is never lighted.\r\nThe streets are clean and well paved, and the stone church in the\r\n_Plaza_, dating from 1757, has an elaborately carved front and two\r\ntowers. In another plaza is the college, a large building with an upper\r\nstory, also built by General Deustua; and both these public squares\r\nhave bronze fountains erected by the Government of General Echenique,\r\nthe late President, besides drinking fountains in the corners of\r\nseveral of the streets. The water is excellent.\r\n\r\nPuno is surrounded by heights covered with patches of potatoes,\r\nbarley, and quinoa (_Chenopodium quinoa_), the huts of Indians being\r\ninterspersed amongst them; and immediately over the town there is\r\nan isolated rocky ridge of carboniferous limestone perforated by\r\nseveral natural caverns, called the Huassa-pata. The shores of the\r\nlake are a few hundred yards from the town, and at the little port\r\nthere are always a number of balsas, made of large bundles of reeds\r\ntied together, with a reed sail.[132] The view to seaward is, however,\r\nconfined by the peninsula of Capachica, and two islands at the mouth of\r\nthe bay of Puno. A canal to enable balsas to come up nearer the town\r\nwas made by the Spanish Intendente Gonzalez Montoya in the beginning of\r\nthe present century.[133]\r\n\r\nThe flora of a country which, though within the tropics, is at an\r\nelevation of nearly thirteen thousand feet above the sea, must\r\nnecessarily be meagre, and the few plants are lowly and inconspicuous.\r\nI noticed the following in the immediate vicinity of Puno. The\r\nonly tree was one of stunted growth, with a pretty pink and white\r\nflower, and dark-green leaves, almost white underneath, called \"oliva\r\nsilvestre\" by the Spaniards, and _ccolli_ in Quichua (_Buddlea\r\ncoriacea_); and of these there were not more than a dozen, sheltered\r\nbehind walls. By far the greater number of plants are _Compositæ_: of\r\nthese I observed three species of _Tagetes_--one with a small yellow\r\nflower; another very sweet, called by the Indians _huaccatay_ and\r\n_chicchipa_, and used to flavour their chupes; and a large shrubby\r\nmarygold, called _sunchu_;[134] also the common sow-thistle, a\r\n_Hieracium_, and the _tola_ and _ccanlli_ before mentioned, used for\r\nfuel. I found two Verbenas and a Solanum, all with purple flowers;\r\na clover, a creeping cucurbitaceous plant, two Cacti, a large dock,\r\nthree Geraniums, all with pink flowers; three Crucifers, very small\r\nherbs, one with a white flower, one with a yellow flower, and the third\r\nthe common shepherd's-purse; a Gilium with a minute white flower, a\r\nsmall legume with tomentose leaves, a pretty little creeping Adoxa,\r\na Statice, a wild Chenopodium, a Veronica, a minute Stellaria, a\r\nRhinanthus, a mallow, a plantago, and three species of wild Oxalis, two\r\nvery minute with white flowers, and one with a yellow flower. There\r\nwere also two ferns, one a very beautiful Gymnogramma with silvery\r\nfronds; nine grasses, the most abundant of which was the coarse _Stipa\r\nychu_; and a few mosses. On the shores of lake Titicaca I saw rushes\r\nin great quantities, a Mimulus, a Ranunculus, a Rumex, and three\r\ngrasses. These plants, though lowly and unpretending, are in sufficient\r\nabundance to cover the country with verdure and pretty wild flowers,\r\nand brighten those parts which are not cultivated. The cultivation\r\nconsists of quinoa, cañahua (both _Chenopodia_), barley, potatos, ocas\r\n(_Oxalis tuberosa_), and wheat in very small quantities, which does not\r\nripen.\r\n\r\nClose to Puno, on the south, are the famous silver-bearing mountains\r\nof Cancharani and Laycaycota, to which Puno owes her existence: and to\r\nthe discovery and working of the Laycaycota mine in the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century a very curious history is attached; which is always\r\ntalked of by the people of Puno as one of the principal events in the\r\nannals of their city.\r\n\r\nIn about 1660 an exceedingly rich vein of silver had been discovered\r\non the hill of Laycaycota, by one José de Salcedo, which was called\r\nthe \"Veta de la Candelaria.\" One account says that the secret of its\r\nexistence was revealed to Salcedo by an Indian girl. José de Salcedo,\r\nand his brother Gaspar, continued to work this vein, and several others\r\nwhich were opened on the Cancharani and Laycaycota hills; enormous\r\nquantities of silver were extracted; and the fame of his enormous\r\nwealth, and its source, attracted crowds of unruly people to the spot,\r\nfrom the various towns of Peru.[135] Salcedo is said to have been\r\ngenerous and open-handed in finding employment for applicants, but,\r\nfrom some unexplained cause, tumults took place at the mines in 1665,\r\nwhich, from first to last, are said to have caused 450 violent deaths.\r\nThe governor of the district, Don Angelo de Peredo, seems to have taken\r\npart against the Salcedos, who retired to the village of Juliaca,\r\nwith a body of armed followers, in November, 1665. In March, 1666,\r\nthey attacked the governor's people who had possession of the mines;\r\nSalcedo neglected repeated orders to come to Lima; and was accused of\r\nhaving threatened to extort a general pardon from the Viceroy, at the\r\nhead of a thousand men. Salcedo himself, however, appears to have been\r\nabsent at Cuzco when the attack was made on the mines. These tumults,\r\naccompanied by much bloodshed, continued until 1669, when the Viceroy\r\nCount of Lemos came to Puno in person, and settled the question by\r\nsending José and Gaspar de Salcedo to Lima, where José was tried,\r\ncondemned, and executed. Gaspar was detained a prisoner in Callao\r\ncastle.\r\n\r\nIt was the general impression at the time, and is so still at Puno,\r\nthat jealousy and envy of their riches occasioned the persecution of\r\nthese men; for not only were the charges against them most frivolous,\r\nbut the Count of Santistevan, the predecessor of the Count of Lemos,\r\nhad caused the Bishop of Arequipa to publish a general pardon of all\r\noffences in 1666. The accusations against José Salcedo were that he\r\nwent about with armed men, took a seat next to the corregidor at\r\na bull-fight in Cuzco, and neglected to obey the order to come to\r\nLima.[136]\r\n\r\nA petition was afterwards sent to Spain, representing that the Salcedos\r\nwere the victims of injustice, and not guilty of disloyalty; that the\r\nViceroy's proceedings were irregular; and that the heirs of the Count\r\nof Lemos were bound to make reparation for the evils caused to these\r\ndeserving men. The petition also prayed that the President of the\r\nCouncil of the Indies might not be allowed to decide the case, because\r\nhe was related to the Count of Lemos.[137] This petition seems to have\r\nreceived favourable consideration; for I find that the son of José de\r\nSalcedo was afterwards created Marquis de la Villa Rica de Puno, and\r\nthat he took a leading part in subsequent mining operations.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable part of this story is that on the day of Salcedo's\r\ndeath the mine became full of water, and the Viceroy was thus\r\ndisappointed in his expectation of succeeding to the wealth of which\r\nhe had deprived his victim. This curious coincidence made a great\r\nimpression on the Indians, which is not yet effaced; and they still\r\npoint out a small lake or pond that is said to cover the once rich vein\r\nor \"Veta de la Candelaria.\"\r\n\r\nSalcedo's son, the Marquis of Villa Rica, attempted to reach his\r\nfather's source of wealth by cutting a horizontal adit or _socabon_ in\r\nthe side of the hill looking on lake Titicaca; and he is said to have\r\npenetrated nearly 700 yards, and within sixty yards of his father's\r\nperpendicular shaft; but his funds failed him, and he died mad. In\r\nspite, however, of the filling up of the \"Candelaria,\" great numbers\r\nof other shafts were sunk, and much silver was extracted, both by the\r\nMarquis, and by other speculators. A report, dated 1718, mentions as\r\nmany as forty-six shafts on the hills near Puno, which were then being\r\nworked.[138] In 1740 a native company attempted to finish the _socabon_\r\nwhich had been commenced by the Marquis, but their workmen were unable\r\nto cut through the masses of porphyry, and, after vast expense, it was\r\nabandoned a second time.\r\n\r\nFrom 1775 to 1824 the mines near Puno yielded ores worth 1,786,000\r\nmarcs of silver, at seven to nine dollars the marc; the richest year\r\nbeing 1802, when the yield was 52,000 marcs; but since 1816 it has been\r\nsteadily decreasing, and in 1824, the year after the expulsion of the\r\nSpaniards, it had sunk very low. In 1826 the _manto_ mine, to which\r\nthe socabon leads, which was excavated by the Marquis of Villa Rica,\r\nwas granted to General O'Brien, a gallant and enthusiastic old Irish\r\nhero of South American independence, who resumed the work, but without\r\nany success. Mr. Begg, an enterprising English merchant, undertook the\r\ncompletion of the _socabon_ in 1830. He imported expensive machinery\r\nfrom England, employed an intelligent engineer named Patterson, and\r\ncontinued to work the _manto_ mine until 1839. He built himself a house\r\nfurnished with every English comfort, and lived in very good style; but\r\nthe speculation was a failure, and he left the country a poor man in\r\n1840, and died in Chile. After the departure of Mr. Begg, some Peruvian\r\nspeculators continued to work at the same mine, but without any energy;\r\nand, at the time of M. de Castelnau's visit in 1845, only thirty\r\nworkmen were employed.[139] When Lieut. Gibbon, U.S.N., passed through\r\nPuno in 1851, the _manto_ was still being worked, but at the time of my\r\nvisit it had been entirely abandoned since 1858.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the great evils arising from the political condition of\r\nPeru since the independence that there is a complete want of confidence\r\nin each other amongst the moneyed classes, and an absence, to a great\r\nextent, of the spirit of enterprise; so that any combination on a\r\nlarge scale for mining, or other purposes of a similar nature, is\r\nalmost impossible. Peru is still a very young country, and there is\r\nreason to hope that this state of things will not continue; but now a\r\nfeeling of suspicion, added to a want of energy, prevents the formation\r\nof native companies. Thus the _manto_ is abandoned, and the numerous\r\nmines which once covered the hills of Cancharani and Laycaycota, and\r\nactually created the city of Puno, which nestles at their feet, are\r\nnot worked. At present there is only one small mine at work, high up\r\non the hill of Cancharani, called the Cachi Vieja. Its proprietor, Don\r\nManuel Ferrandis, is an upright, intelligent, and most kind-hearted old\r\ngentleman, who has had much experience in mining operations; and on the\r\n29th of March he took me to visit the abandoned _manto_, and his own\r\nworks at Cachi Vieja.\r\n\r\nAbout two miles south of Puno is the establishment built by Mr.\r\nBegg, at the foot of the Laycaycota mountain, and facing the lake.\r\nThe buildings stand round a long courtyard, containing four trees of\r\nthe _oliva silvestre_, probably, as the only trees in the country,\r\nonce carefully tended by the former English residents. There is a\r\nsteam-engine which turns a large stone wheel, twelve feet in diameter,\r\nfor grinding the ores; and the quicksilver was separated by the heat of\r\nfires of llama-dung and _tola_,[140] the only fuel to be had. In the\r\nhouse there were papered rooms, fire-grates, and English conveniences,\r\nnow all in ruins, and the rooms used as stables for donkeys. At a short\r\ndistance from Mr. Begg's ruined house, and a little higher up the\r\nmountain, is the entrance to the famous \"_Socabon de Vera Cruz_\" of the\r\n_manto_ mine, commenced by the Marquis of Villa Rica, and finished by\r\nMr. Begg. The \"_socabon_\" penetrates into the mountain, in a generally\r\nsouth-west direction, for a distance of a mile and a quarter; the first\r\n900 yards having a depth of some feet of water, which is dammed up\r\nat a little distance outside the entrance. This part of the gallery\r\nis navigated by an iron canoe about a foot and a half wide; but the\r\ncanal is so narrow that the canoe frequently grates on both sides at\r\nonce against the rocks. The roof of the excavation, too, is very low,\r\nand several times we actually had to crouch down in the bottom of the\r\ncanoe, to avoid knocking our heads. Thus we penetrated into the bowels\r\nof the earth by this subterranean navigation, with an Indian holding\r\na burning torch in the bows. From the entrance, for about 300 yards,\r\nthe excavation traverses a mass of grey porphyry. In the 900 yards of\r\nnavigation there are six locks; and when the water terminates, the\r\ngallery continues for a hundred yards, where there is an iron tramway\r\nlaid down. The metal was dragged down to the head of navigation in\r\ncars, by two old mules, one of which had not seen daylight for fifteen\r\nyears when they ceased to work the mine. At the point where the tramway\r\ncomes to an end, the gallery still continues for 1200 yards; but this\r\npart is very narrow and tortuous, and the metal was carried down to\r\nthe cars on the backs of Indians. The rock at the extreme end of the\r\nexcavation is a very hard green porphyry, with quartz and veins of\r\nsilver ore.\r\n\r\nThe Cachi Vieja works are high up on the Laycaycota hill, and not far\r\nfrom the famous \"Veta de la Candelaria.\" The mouth of the shaft is in a\r\nbuilding opening on a courtyard, where women were sorting the ores in\r\nsmall heaps. The most abundant ore is called _brosa_, containing forty\r\nmarcs of silver in the cajon of fifty quintals (cwts.); other ores are\r\ncalled _rosicler_, _pavonado_, and _polvarilla_. The _rosicler_, or\r\nruby silver, is a most beautiful rose-coloured mineral, containing a\r\nconsiderable quantity of silver.[141]\r\n\r\nBesides Cachi Vieja in the immediate vicinity of Puno, there are some\r\nvery productive silver-mines at San Antonio de Esquilache, twenty miles\r\nsouth-west of that town, which have been worked since 1847 by Don\r\nManuel Costas, one of the most influential citizens of Puno, and my\r\nhost during my stay in that city.\r\n\r\nWool and silver are the great staple products of the department of\r\nPuno; the whole value of exported articles being about 1,200,000\r\ndollars.[142] The population is rather under 300,000 souls; that of\r\nthe town of Puno 9000.[143] Upwards of 1,500,000 dollars come into the\r\ndepartment yearly, either in payments for wool, or in salaries for\r\nofficials, without counting the expenditure for the troops; and it is\r\ncalculated that more than half this sum eventually finds its way into\r\nthe hands of the Indians, who bury it. Thus, in considering the mineral\r\nwealth of Peru, the enormous quantities of coined money, and vases or\r\nother articles made of the precious metals, which have been buried\r\nby the Indians, must be taken into consideration; for this practice\r\nhas been going on since the time of the Incas. Now that the currency\r\nconsists almost entirely of the debased half-dollars of Bolivia, if\r\na Spanish dollar or any other good coin is accidently received by an\r\nIndian, it is immediately buried.\r\n\r\nThe principal people in Puno, during my visit, were General San Roman,\r\nin command of the army of the South, an old man with the face and head\r\nof a pure Indian, and plenty of white hair brushed off his forehead,\r\nwho has been mixed up in all the wars since 1822, and from whom I\r\nreceived much information respecting the Indian rebellion of Tupac\r\nAmaru in 1780, and of Pumacagua in 1815; Señor Garces, the Prefect; Don\r\nJuan Francisco Oviedo; Don Manuel Costas; and Don Manuel Ferrandis,\r\nthe proprietor of the mine on the Laycaycota hill. Every evening there\r\nwas a party assembled at the house of the latter to drink coffee,\r\nand talk over the news of the day. On these occasions, amongst other\r\ntopics of conversation, the possibility of forming a company for the\r\nnavigation of lake Titicaca was frequently discussed. Costas had first\r\nbeen struck by the immense good that steam navigation on the lake would\r\nbring to the department of Puno in 1840, and in 1846 he purchased a\r\nsmall steamer called the 'Titicaca,' and had her sent out in pieces.\r\nHe sold her to the Government, on condition that they would defray the\r\nexpense of sending her up to the lake; but this was never done. It is\r\nconsidered that any steamers which may hereafter be ordered for this\r\npurpose should be about forty tons, drawing four and a half feet, with\r\npaddles (as a screw would inevitably foul amongst the rushes), and\r\naccommodation for passengers on deck. They would take all the products\r\nof the Bolivian forests, bark, timber, chocolate, coca, fruit, and\r\narnotto, to Puno; European manufactured goods, sugar of Abancay, and\r\naguardiente of the coast, from Puno to Bolivia; provisions and traffic\r\nof all kinds amongst the Indians of the shores; and copper of Coracora\r\nto Puno. Timber in vast quantities might be felled in the forests of\r\nCaravaya, and floated down the rivers of Azangaro and Ramiz during the\r\nrainy season, which, with the coal on the island of Soto, would furnish\r\nsupplies of fuel. Markets and easy means of communication having been\r\nformed, the trade would rapidly increase on all sides. The face of\r\nthe country would be entirely changed; the people, finding new wants,\r\nwould become more civilised; and Puno, instead of a city with empty\r\nsilent streets, and half a dozen balsas at its anchorage, would be a\r\nflourishing and busy port.[144] These bright prospects, however, will\r\nrequire time, and a total change in the political condition of Peru,\r\nfor their realization in a somewhat distant future.\r\n\r\nIt is also a very important question whether larches, firs, and\r\nbirch-trees might not be naturalized in the more sheltered ravines\r\nof these lofty treeless regions; where large plantations might be\r\nformed for the supply of timber and fuel. The Indians are now entirely\r\ndependent, for the framework of their roofs, on the crooked poles of\r\nthe _queñua_ tree (_Polylepis tomentella_); and for fuel on llama's\r\ndung and the _tola_ shrubs (_Baccharis_). The winters, from May to\r\nSeptember, are not nearly so cold as in Scotland, though very dry;\r\nand, during the summer or rainy season, though it is cold, there is\r\nplenty of moisture. The introduction of these plantations would change\r\nthe whole face of the country, and the introducer would confer an\r\ninestimable blessing on the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nI remained for some time at Puno, in order to collect information,\r\nand come to a determination respecting the best course to pursue in\r\nthe performance of the service on which I was employed. The supply of\r\nthe bark of _Chinchona Calisaya_ trees is now entirely procured from\r\nthe forests of Munecas, Apollobamba, Yuracares, Larecaja, Inquisivi,\r\nAyopaya, and the _yungus_ of La Paz in Bolivia; but I found that the\r\ndifficulties in the way of making a collection of plants and seeds in\r\nthese districts would be very great, and it afterwards turned out that\r\nthese difficulties would have been insurmountable. As a considerable\r\npart of the revenue of Bolivia is derived from the bark trade, which is\r\nnot the case in Peru, the Bolivians are exceedingly jealous of their\r\nmonopoly; and the nature of my mission was already suspected. Moreover\r\nthere was an imminent prospect of a war between Peru and Bolivia; a\r\nlarge army was massed in three divisions--at Puno under General San\r\nRoman, at Vilque under Beltran, and at Lampa under Frisancho; and, as\r\nsoon as hostilities commenced, it would have been next to impossible\r\nfor a private person to preserve his mules from seizure. This war\r\ndid not actually take place, but Linares, the President of Bolivia,\r\nissued a decree on May 14th prohibiting all traffic, or the passage\r\nof travellers, from one country to the other;[145] a decree which was\r\nstrictly enforced, and which would have rendered it impracticable at\r\nthat time to have conveyed myself and companion, with laden mules, from\r\nBolivia to the coast, without long delays and detentions. One of the\r\npretexts for this threatened war is perhaps the most extraordinary\r\nthat has ever been alleged in modern times; namely, that the Bolivian\r\nGovernment persisted in coining and deluging Peru with debased\r\nhalf-dollars. A strange way of settling a financial difficulty!\r\n\r\nWhile these objections weighed against an attempt to collect plants\r\nin the forests of Bolivia, I found that, with regard to the chinchona\r\nforests of the Peruvian province of Caravaya, on the frontier of Peru\r\nand Bolivia, the facilities for such an enterprise would be much\r\ngreater. I had reason to believe, though I afterwards found myself in\r\nerror, that, as there was no bark trade in Peru of any importance,[146]\r\nno jealousy would be felt at the nature of my mission. Any hostile\r\nproceedings on the Bolivian frontier would not materially affect the\r\nroute between the Caravaya forests and the coast; and, above all,\r\nCaravaya is much nearer and more accessible, as regards an available\r\nseaport, than any part of the chinchona forests of Bolivia. This latter\r\npoint was of the very greatest importance, because success depended\r\nchiefly on the rapidity with which the plants could be conveyed\r\nacross the frozen plains of the cordilleras. I knew from Dr. Weddell\r\nthat, though the bark trade from Caravaya has now ceased, and bark\r\nfrom that district is of no market value, owing to a foolish habit\r\nof adulteration amongst speculators in former times, yet that young\r\nplants, and trees bearing fruit, of the _Chinchona Calisaya_, and other\r\nvaluable species, were abundant in the forests of that province, as far\r\nnorth as the valley of Sandia.\r\n\r\nI, therefore, after much anxious consideration, determined to proceed\r\ndirect from Puno to the forests of Caravaya.\r\n\r\nDuring my stay at Puno I had opportunities of examining some\r\ninteresting ruins, and of collecting information respecting the Indian\r\npopulation of Peru, especially with regard to the great insurrections\r\nof Tupac Amaru and Pumacagua in 1780 and 1815. Much of this information\r\nis quite new; and I, therefore, trust that a description of ancient\r\nruins near Puno, and an account of some of the most stirring events\r\nconnected with the Indians since the Spanish conquest, may prove of\r\nsufficient general interest to justify a halt on the road to the\r\nchinchona forests, and a brief digression from the principal subject of\r\nthe present work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BALSA ON LAKE TITICACA. See page 95]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nLAKE TITICACA.\r\n\r\nThe Aymara Indians--Their\r\nantiquities--Tiahuanaco--Coati--Sillustani--Copacabana.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE region which is drained by rivers flowing from the maritime\r\ncordillera and the eastern range of the Andes into lake Titicaca\r\nconsists of elevated plateaux, seldom less than 13,000 feet above the\r\nsea, which were originally inhabited by the Aymara race of Indians,\r\na people differing in some respects from the Indians of Cuzco and\r\nfurther north, and whose civilization dates from a period far anterior\r\nto that of the Incas. Their language is different from the Quichua of\r\nthe Incas, though evidently a sister tongue, and it is still spoken\r\nby the Aymara Indians from Puno to the central parts of Bolivia,\r\nincluding all the shores of lake Titicaca. I did not, however, observe\r\nmuch difference between the Indians of Puno, who speak Aymara, and the\r\nQuichua Indians of Cuzco. The men are, perhaps, somewhat stouter; but\r\nthey are the same race in all essential points.\r\n\r\nThe lake of Titicaca, the great feature in the region inhabited by the\r\nAymara Indians, is about eighty miles long by forty broad; being by\r\nfar the largest lake in South America. It is divided into two parts by\r\nthe peninsula of Copacabana; the southern division, called the lake of\r\nHuaqui, being eight leagues long by seven, and united to the greater\r\nlake by the strait of Tiquina. A number of rivers, which are swollen\r\nand of considerable volume during the rainy season, flow into the lake.\r\nThe largest of these is the Ramiz, which is formed by the junction of\r\nthe two rivers of Pucara and Azangaro, and enters the lake at its\r\nnorth-west corner. The Suchiz, formed by the rivers of Cavanilla and\r\nLampa, also flows into the lake on its north side, as well as the Yllpa\r\nand Ylave; while on the eastern side are the rivers Huarina, Escoma,\r\nand Achacache, all flowing from a low lateral chain, parallel with\r\nthe great eastern Andes, whose gigantic peaks of Illimani and Sorata\r\nform the principal feature of the views from all parts of the lake.\r\nMuch of the water thus flowing in is drained off by the great river\r\nDesaguadero, which flows out of the south-west corner, and disappears\r\nin the swampy lake of Aullagas, in the south of Bolivia; and perhaps a\r\ngreater quantity is taken up by evaporation; for the volume of water\r\nwhich flows in during the rainy season, when the sun travels north,\r\nis drunk up again when the tutelar deity of the lake returns, between\r\nApril and September.[147] Indeed it is evident that the waters are\r\nsteadily receding, under the combined influence of evaporation and of\r\nthe sediment brought down by the rivers. Lake Titicaca is very deep in\r\nsome places, the deepest part being on the Bolivian side; but in others\r\nit is so shoal that there is only just room to force the balsas through\r\nthe rushes. The winds blow from the eastward all the year round,\r\nsometimes in strong gales, so as to raise a very heavy sea, during\r\nthe day-time; but at night they are occasionally westerly. Along the\r\nwestern shore there are acres of tall rushes, and the east winds blow\r\nall the dead rushes to the western side, mixing with the living beds,\r\nand forming a dense tangled mass. The lake abounds in fish of very\r\npeculiar forms, and in aquatic birds.\r\n\r\nThe principal islands of the lake are those of Titicaca and Coati, near\r\nthe peninsula of Copacabana; that of Campanario in the east, opposite\r\nthe town of Escoma, and nine miles from the shore; Soto, also in the\r\nnorthern part, which is said to contain coal;[148] and Esteves, in the\r\nbay of Puno, where the patriot prisoners were confined by the Spaniards\r\nduring the war of independence; besides a small archipelago in the lake\r\nof Huaqui.\r\n\r\nA very ancient civilization existed on the shores of lake Titicaca long\r\nbefore the appearance of the first Inca of Peru; the principal remains\r\nof which are to be found at Tiahuanaco,[149] near the southern shore of\r\nthe lake of Huaqui. An extensive tract is here covered by huge blocks\r\nof carved stone. It was with much regret that I was obliged, by my\r\nduty, to give up my intention of visiting these interesting remains.\r\nM. de Castelnau mentions two colossal statues of a man and a woman,\r\ncrowned with a kind of turban; a colossal head and a lizard carved on\r\nblocks of stone; a great conical artificial hill; and a monolithic\r\ndoorway, the upper part of which is covered with very curious\r\nsculpture. In the centre there is a figure, probably representing\r\nthe Sun, and on each side a number of figures all turned towards it,\r\nwith wings, and sceptres in their hands: those on one side with their\r\nheads crowned, and those on the other with heads of griffins, and the\r\nbodies adorned with garlands of human heads.[150] All who have visited\r\nthese ruins consider them to be of a distinct character from those\r\nof Cuzco, and other works of the Incas. The stones are more richly\r\ncarved, and many of them have been united by means of a metal poured\r\ninto transverse grooves. M. de Castelnau considers that the chief\r\ncharacteristic of Aymara ruins is the minute detail in the carving on\r\nthe stones, while that of the Incas consists in the grand simplicity of\r\nthe masonry.[151]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TOWERS OF SILLUSTANI. Page 111.]\r\n\r\nOn the islands of Titicaca and Coati there are also extensive ruins,\r\nthe remains of temples and convents of virgins dedicated to the worship\r\nof the Sun and Moon; and Dr. Weddell mentions that there is a kind of\r\nphlox on these islands (_Cantua buxifolia_), its very elegant long\r\nscarlet flower being called by the Aymara Indians the \"flower of the\r\nIncas.\"[152]\r\n\r\nAlthough I was unable to visit either the ruins at Tiahuanaco or those\r\non the islands, I found time to examine ruins of the same character on\r\nthe shores of the lake of Umayu near Vilque, where the great cemetery\r\nof the chiefs of the Aymara tribes of the Collao appears to have been.\r\nThese ruins are at a place called Sillustani, on the north side of the\r\nlake of Umayu, where a high rocky table-land juts out so as to form a\r\npeninsula, which is literally covered with places of sepulture. Four\r\nof them are towers of finely-cut masonry, equal to that of Cuzco, with\r\nthe sides of the stones dovetailing into each other. On climbing up\r\nthe steep rocky path which leads to the table-land, the first on the\r\nright-hand side is perched on the very edge of the northern precipice.\r\nHalf of it is destroyed, the other half is of well-cut stones, with\r\na broad rounded cornice near the summit, and a vaulted roof, part of\r\nwhich remains entire. In the interior, near the foundation, there\r\nis a vaulted chamber entered by a small aperture, and full of human\r\nbones. The rest of the tower was filled up with small stones and earth,\r\nleaving a narrow shaft which ascended from the chamber to the summit,\r\ndown which the bodies may have been lowered into the chamber.\r\n\r\nOn the left there is another smaller tower of exactly similar\r\nconstruction. Further on, and near the verge of the southern precipice,\r\nthere are two other towers close together. One is thirty-six feet high,\r\nand built of the same well-cut masonry, with a cornice and vaulted\r\nroof, and a great lizard carved in relief on one of the stones near\r\nthe base, which measures six feet by three.[153] The other tower was\r\napparently exactly similar, but it is now in a very ruinous state.\r\n\r\nBesides these more remarkable edifices, the table-land is covered\r\nwith other towers of rough unhewn stone and earth, and there are the\r\nremains of two square edifices built of cyclopean stones. The fallen\r\nparts of the towers were covered with masses of bright yellow compositæ\r\ncalled _suncho_, and a purple solanum; and they were frequented by the\r\ncreepers called _haccacllo_, little green paroquets, a small quail\r\ncalled _pucupucu_, and the little ground-dove _cullca_; numbers of\r\n_biscache_ rabbits burrowed in the ruins, while two or three lordly\r\n_coraquenques_ soared in circles over the table-land. After carefully\r\nexamining the old towers of Sillustani, I passed the night in a very\r\nsmall hut, close to the lake of Umayu, the waters of which were smooth\r\nas glass, an island in the centre, and blue ranges of mountains capped\r\nwith snow in the distance. To get into the hut it was necessary to go\r\non hands and knees, the doorway being only three feet high, with a hide\r\ndoor stretched on a wooden frame. The hut was built of rough stones and\r\nthatched with barley-straw; but inside there was a hospitable welcome\r\nand good cheer: the old Indian who dwelt there, and his young daughter,\r\nproviding excellent boiled potatoes, cream-cheese, and fresh milk.\r\n\r\nThe ruins of Tiahuanaco, and on the islands in the lake, and the\r\ntowers of Sillustani, are the principal remains of ancient Aymara\r\ncivilization. Nothing is known respecting the people who raised these\r\nimperishable monuments, except that, in the middle of the eleventh\r\ncentury, a man and woman, declaring themselves to be children of the\r\nSun, are said to have first appeared on the shores of the great lake,\r\nand, marching north, to have founded the empire of the Incas. The\r\ncircumstance that Manco Ccapac, the first Inca of Peru, originally\r\nappeared in the country of the Aymaras, has led to the belief that\r\nhe was himself a chief of that nation; but I am more inclined to the\r\nopinion that he was one of a band of adventurers who had been brought\r\nfrom Asia, or her vast archipelago of islands, by the westerly winds\r\nof the South Pacific, and the southerly breezes of the coast, to the\r\nport of Arica; that he thence made his way to the banks of the great\r\nlake, where he became indoctrinated in the religion of the people; and\r\nthat, for some reason, he continued his wanderings, until he finally\r\ncollected a sufficiently numerous following to found an independent\r\nstate at Cuzco. It seems certain, from emblems found carved upon the\r\nruins, and from tradition, that the worship of the Sun and Moon was\r\nestablished amongst the Aymaras for ages before the conquest of their\r\ncountry by the Incas of Cuzco.\r\n\r\nIt was not for several generations after the foundation of the empire\r\nof the Incas, that their conquests were extended over the Aymara nation\r\nof the Collao; and it was not until about the middle of the eleventh\r\ncentury that the country on the shores of lake Titicaca became part of\r\nthe great empire whose centre and capital was at Cuzco. From that time\r\nthe islands of Titicaca and Coata, and the peninsula of Copacabana,\r\nbecame the most sacred and venerated spots within the dominions of the\r\nIncas; as the localities where their great progenitor Manco Ccapac was\r\nbelieved to have made his first appearance.\r\n\r\nCopacabana means \"the place of a precious stone,\" _copa_ being a\r\nprecious stone, and _cavana_ a place where anything is seen.[154] A\r\nrock called Titicaca gave its name to the island and lake: _titi_ being\r\nAymara for a cat, and _caca_ a rock, for on this rock a cat is said\r\nto have sat with fire shooting from its eyes.[155] In Quichua _titi_\r\nmeans lead. On this rock, which is at the west end of the island of\r\nTiticaca,[156] there was an altar where the Aymaras adored the Sun, and\r\nnear it there were three idols joined in one, called _Apu Ynti_ (the\r\nChief Sun), _Churip Ynti_ (the Son's Sun), and _Yntip Huauqui_ (Brother\r\nof the Sun). The Inca Tupac Yupanqui (A.D. 1439-75) founded a palace\r\nand a village about half a league from the rock, and established a\r\nconvent of virgins there.[157]\r\n\r\nThe island of Coata, a league to the eastward of Titicaca, was\r\ndedicated to the Moon, the name being derived from Coyata, the\r\naccusative of Coya, a queen; the Moon ranking as wife to the Sun. The\r\nruins of the _Accla huasi_, or convent of virgins, on Coata island, are\r\n120 feet long, the interior being divided into numerous cells, with\r\nrows of niches in the walls. They are now overshadowed by queñua-trees,\r\nwhose dark foliage adds to the sombre melancholy of these silent\r\nmemorials of the past. On both the islands there were, in the time\r\nof the Incas, large establishments of Virgins of the Sun, who were\r\ndivided into three grades, according to their beauty. The most lovely\r\nwere called _Guayruro_; the next _Yurac Aclla_, or white maidens; and\r\nthe plain ones _Paco Aclla_, or beast maidens. Each grade was governed\r\nby a _Mamacona_ or nurse, and an _Apu-panaca_ or governor lived near\r\nthe convent, who guarded it, and supplied its inmates with provisions.\r\nThe occupations of the virgins were weaving, embroidery, and brewing\r\nsacrificial _chicha_, to be poured out on the altar of the deity.[158]\r\n\r\nAfter the conquest, the Spanish Viceroys handed over the province of\r\nChucuito, and the islands in the lake, to the Dominican friars, who\r\nsucceeded in introducing far grosser and more degrading superstitions\r\namongst the Indians than they had ever practised on the islands of\r\nTiticaca and Coata; and in establishing, on the adjacent peninsula\r\nof Copacabana, a shrine, the pretended sanctity of which attracted\r\ndevotees and rich presents from all parts of Spanish America.\r\n\r\nIts origin appears to have been as follows:--A member of the family of\r\nthe Incas, named Francisco Titu Yupanqui, not having money enough to\r\nbuy an image of the Virgin for his church, painted a very bad picture,\r\nand the cura, Antonio de Almeida, either to please the Indian, or\r\nbecause there were few images or pictures in the country, allowed it\r\nto be placed near the altar. But the next cura, Antonio de Montoro,\r\nseeing that it caused more laughter than devotion, ordered it to be\r\nput in a corner of the sacristy. The poor artist then went to Potosi\r\nto learn to paint, and, after much labour, he succeeded in completing\r\na picture which, the moment it was placed in the church at Copacabana,\r\nbegan to work miracles. It was set up in 1583, and the Inca painter\r\ndied in 1608. The first thing the picture did was to banish all devils\r\nout of the province, and to cure many Indians of their diseases; and\r\nits fame became so great that in 1588 the Count of Villar, viceroy of\r\nPeru, solemnly delivered it to the care of the Augustine friars by a\r\nroyal edict. Between 1589 and 1652 it is said to have performed 186\r\nmiracles. One Alonzo de Escote, for favours received, saved up money\r\nfor the purpose of giving the Virgin a lamp, and at length he presented\r\nthe richest then to be found in the Spanish colonies, twenty feet long,\r\nwith sockets for as many candles as there are days in the year, all of\r\nsolid silver. Even as late as 1845, when Dr. Weddell saw the church, it\r\nwas very richly gilt.\r\n\r\n\"Other images,\" says Father Calancha, \"in Europe and Asia perform\r\nmiracles in their own towns or provinces, but this picture of\r\nCopacabana performs them all over the new world, and in parts of\r\nEurope!\"[159]\r\n\r\nThus the Spanish conquerors supplied the Aymara Indians of the shores\r\nof lake Titicaca with an object of devotion in the shape of this old\r\npicture; which was to replace their former simple worship of the Sun\r\nand Moon on the sacred islands of the lake. It will be interesting\r\nto examine briefly the way the Spaniards treated the people they\r\nsubjected, in other respects, and to glance at the kind of government\r\nwhich they substituted for the mild rule of the Incas.\r\n\r\nThe forefathers of the present Aymara Indians established a\r\ncivilization of which we have no record save the silent evidence of\r\nthose cyclopean ruins which have just been described. Subsequently, for\r\nnearly four centuries, from the middle of the twelfth to the sixteenth,\r\nthey formed a part of the empire of the Incas, and their land was then\r\ncalled Collasuyu. During this period the Incas followed their constant\r\npolicy of superseding the language of the conquered land by their own\r\nmore polished Quichua; and they so far succeeded that the Aymara, which\r\nonce extended and was spoken all over the Collao, as far as the pass\r\nof Ayaviri, on the road to Cuzco, has been entirely superseded in all\r\nparts north of Puno by the Quichua, and is now only spoken between Puno\r\nand La Paz, and farther south. Nevertheless the people enjoyed a long\r\nperiod of tranquillity and prosperity during the happy rule of the\r\nIncas, and the population continued to increase. With the introduction\r\nof Spanish rule a blight fell upon them: and we shall now see how the\r\nbeneficent laws of the sovereigns of Castile were administered by their\r\nunworthy servants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE PERUVIAN INDIANS:\r\n\r\nTheir condition under Spanish colonial rule.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN reviewing the deplorable results of Spanish domination in South\r\nAmerica, it may at once be conceded that the legislation which\r\noriginated from the councils of the kings of Castile was always, except\r\nin matters connected with religion, remarkable for beneficence and\r\nliberality in all that concerned the natives; and that, in the words\r\nof Mr. Helps, \"those humane and benevolent laws, which emanated from\r\ntime to time from the Home Government, rendered the sway of the Spanish\r\nmonarchs over the conquered nations as remarkable for mildness as any,\r\nperhaps, that has ever been recorded in the pages of history.\"[160] It\r\nmay also be allowed that the Viceroys of Peru were generally earnest\r\nand zealous statesmen, who conscientiously strove to enforce the\r\nregulations which they from time to time received from the council of\r\nthe Indies.\r\n\r\nBut it was almost as impossible for the viceroys to exercise efficient\r\npersonal supervision over the government of so enormous a country,\r\nwhile residing at Lima, as it would have been if they had remained at\r\nthe council-table in Seville; and their subordinates were, as a body,\r\nuntrustworthy, extortionate, rapacious, and often remorselessly cruel.\r\nThus the benign laws of the Spanish kings became a dead letter in\r\nSouth America, and the natives groaned, for three centuries, under a\r\nyoke which crashed them to the earth, and converted vast tracts of once\r\nthickly populated country into uninhabited deserts.\r\n\r\nYet the humane intentions of the Spanish government, and the labours\r\nof the Peruvian viceroys, were not wholly without results; and it is\r\npartly due to them that a system of worse than African slavery was not\r\nestablished in Peru, and that the native race has not long ago become\r\nentirely extinct.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Spanish conquest Pizarro was empowered, in 1529,\r\nto grant \"_encomiendas_,\" or estates, to his fellow-conquerors, the\r\ninhabitants of which were bound to pay tribute to the holders of the\r\ngrants; and in 1536 these _encomiendas_ were extended to two lives.\r\nThe consequent exactions and cruelties were so intolerable that the\r\ngood Las Casas, and other friends of the Indians, at length induced\r\nthe Emperor Charles V. to enact the code so well known as the \"New\r\nLaws,\" in 1542; by which the _encomiendas_ were to pass immediately to\r\nthe Crown after the death of the actual holders; all officers under\r\ngovernment were prohibited from holding them; all men who had been\r\nmixed up in the civil wars of the Pizarros and Almagros were to be\r\ndeprived at once; a fixed sum was to be settled as tribute to be paid\r\nby the Indians; and all forced personal labour was absolutely forbidden.\r\n\r\nThe promulgation of these beneficent laws excited a howl of furious\r\nexecration from the conquerors,--the wolves who were thus to be dragged\r\naway, when their fangs were actually fixed in the flesh of their\r\nvictims. Gonzalo Pizarro rose in rebellion in Peru, and defeated and\r\nkilled Blasco Nuñez de Vela, the viceroy who had arrived to enforce\r\nthese \"New Laws;\" while the more politic Belalcazar, at Popayan,\r\nthough professing obedience, contrived to evade the execution of his\r\norders, after a fashion which gave rise to the well-known saying--\"_se\r\nobedece, pero no se cumple_\"--\"he obeys, but does not fulfil.\" Their\r\nunpopularity was so great that it was considered unsafe to persist\r\nin the attempt to enforce them, and they were revoked in 1545. The\r\nPresident Gasca re-distributed the \"_encomiendas_\" in 1550, and they\r\nwere granted for three lives in 1629. Gasca, who showed more regard for\r\nhis own safety and convenience than for the public service, arranged\r\nthat his settlement of the _encomiendas_ should not be promulgated\r\nuntil he had sailed for Spain, and he suspended the law prohibiting the\r\nforced personal service of the Indians. The latter enactment, however,\r\nwas boldly promulgated by the Judges of the Royal Audience in 1552, and\r\nwas, as might have been expected, immediately followed by a ferment\r\namongst the conquerors and a formidable rebellion. Finally the Marquis\r\nof Cañete arrived in Peru, as viceroy, in 1554; and, by a mixture of\r\nseverity and prudent conciliation, trod out the last sparks of revolt\r\namongst the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nIn 1568 the viceroy Don Francisco de Toledo established the system\r\nunder which the native population of Peru was professedly ruled for\r\nthe two succeeding centuries. Toledo was a bigot, without pity, and\r\ninexorably cruel. Justice or humanity had no weight with him if they\r\nstood in the way of any policy which he deemed to be advisable, as\r\nwas shown in the judicial murder of the young Inca Tupac Amaru. But\r\nhe was a faithful servant of his sovereign, and resolutely determined\r\nto enforce the edicts of the Council of the Indies; a statesman of\r\nconsiderable ability and untiring industry. He was so prolific in\r\nlegislation that, on the subject of coca-cultivation alone, he issued\r\nseventy ordinances; and future viceroys referred to his rules and\r\nenactments as to a received and authoritative text-book. The viceroy\r\nMarquis of Montes Claros, in 1615, declared that \"all future rulers of\r\nPeru were but disciples of Francisco de Toledo, that great master of\r\nstatesmanship.\"\r\n\r\nBy his _Libro de Tasas_, or Book of Rules, Toledo fixed the tribute to\r\nbe paid by the Indians, exempting all men under the age of eighteen,\r\nor over that of fifty. The Indians were governed by native chiefs of\r\ntheir own people, whose duty it was to collect the tribute, and pay it\r\nin to the Spanish corregidor or governor of the province, as well as\r\nto exercise subordinate magisterial functions. These chiefs, called\r\n_Curacas_ in the time of the Incas, were ordered by Toledo to be named\r\n_Caciques_, a word brought from the West Indian islands;[161] and under\r\nthem there were two other native officials--the _Pichca-pachacas_,\r\nplaced over 500 Indians, and the _Pachacas_ over 100. These offices\r\nwere inherited from father to son, and their possessors enjoyed several\r\nprivileges, such as the exemption from arrest, except for grave\r\noffences, and they received a fixed salary. The native Caciques were\r\noften men of considerable wealth; some of them were members of the\r\nroyal family of the Incas; they were free from the payment of tribute\r\nand from personal service; and thus occupied positions of importance\r\namongst their countrymen.[162] They wore the same dress which\r\ndistinguished the nobles of the Inca's court, consisting of a tunic\r\ncalled _uncu_, a rich mantle or cloak of black velvet called _yacolla_,\r\nintended as mourning for the fall of their ancient rulers; and those of\r\nthe family of the Incas added a sort of coronet, whence a red fringe\r\nof alpaca-wool descended as an emblem of nobility. This head-dress\r\nwas called _mascapaycha_. They had pictures of the Incas in their\r\nhouses, and encouraged the periodical festivals in memory of their\r\nbeloved sovereigns, when plays were enacted, and mournful music was\r\nproduced from the national instruments, drums, trumpets, clarions, and\r\n_pututus_, or sea shells.[163] All these customs were left unchanged by\r\nToledo, and the system so far resembles that which now prevails in the\r\nDutch colony of Java.[164]\r\n\r\nBut, in addition to the tribute, the amount of which as established\r\nby Toledo was not excessive, and which was rendered still less\r\nobjectionable to the Indians from being collected by their native\r\nchiefs, there was the _mita_ or forced labour in mines, manufactories,\r\nand farms,[165] which became the instrument of fearful oppression\r\nand cruelty. Toledo enacted that a seventh part of the adult male\r\npopulation of every village should be subject to the _mita_, and\r\nordered that the Caciques should send these _mitayos_, as they were\r\ncalled, to the public squares of the nearest Spanish towns, where they\r\nmight be hired by those who required their services; and laws were\r\nenacted to regulate the distance they might be taken from their homes,\r\nand their payment.[166] It appears, however, that this seventh part\r\nof the working men who were told off for forced labour was exclusive\r\nof those employed in the mines, so that, even in theory, the _mita_\r\ncondemned a large fraction of the population to slavery.[167]\r\n\r\nThere was a class of Indians, numbering about 40,000 souls in the time\r\nof Toledo (1570), called _Yanaconas_, who were scattered over Peru, and\r\nforced to work on the lands of Spaniards, or as domestic servants.\r\nThey may have been descendants of captives in war, or of persons who\r\nhad been condemned to slavery in the time of the Incas, and thus\r\nbecame the property of the conquerors; but in 1601 an enactment was\r\npromulgated to ameliorate their condition, and fix the terms of their\r\nservice.[168]\r\n\r\nIn matters connected with religion the Spanish legislators allowed of\r\nno temporizing policy. All signs of idolatry must disappear, and with\r\nthe new religion came additional exactions, in the shape of fees for\r\nmasses, burials, and christenings. Toledo enacted many laws for the\r\nsuppression of the old religion of the Incas: any Indian who married\r\nan idolatrous woman was to receive one hundred stripes, \"because that\r\nis the punishment which they dislike most;\" the people were prohibited\r\nfrom using surnames taken from the names of birds, beasts, serpents,\r\nor rivers, which was their ancient custom; and no Indian who had been\r\npunished for idolatry, joining in infidel rites, or dancing the dance\r\ncalled _arihua_, could be appointed to hold any public office.[169]\r\n\r\nOn the whole, however, the legislation of the Spanish kings, and the\r\nreports of the viceroys of Peru, display an earnest desire to protect\r\nthe Indians from tyranny, and to render their condition tolerable.\r\nIn 1615 the Marquis of Montes Claros impressed on his successor the\r\nimportance of obliging all classes of Spaniards to treat the Indians\r\nwell, and of chastising oppression with rigour. In 1681 the Count\r\nof Castellar states that one of the points most dwelt upon in the\r\ninstructions given to the viceroys, and in repeated royal enactments,\r\nwas the humane treatment of the Indians; and he declares that he\r\nalways sought to enforce these orders from the day that he landed in\r\nPeru; and words to the same effect are to be found in the reports of\r\nmost of the other viceroys.[170]\r\n\r\nBut side by side with these evidences of the good intentions of the\r\nGovernment, is the testimony of the viceroys that their efforts to\r\ncomply with these beneficent orders, and enforce these humane laws,\r\nwere fruitless, and rendered of no effect by the unworthiness of their\r\nsubordinates; and almost all complain of the rapid depopulation of the\r\ncountry. In 1620 the Prince of Esquilache reported that \"the arm of the\r\nviceroy was not powerful against the negligence and maladministration\r\nof the corregidors;\" in 1681 the Count of Castellar said that he had\r\nto correct and punish the excesses both of the corregidors and the\r\ncuras; in 1697 the Duke of La Palata speaks of the depopulation of the\r\nvillages and towns, caused by the forcible detention of the Indians to\r\nwork at the mines, in cloth and cotton workshops, and in farms; and\r\nanother viceroy attributes the rapid depopulation of the country to the\r\nsame causes, and also to drink, and urges a closer supervision of the\r\nconduct of the corregidors and curas.\r\n\r\nI have, in a former work, given a brief account of the treatment of\r\nthe Indians, and of the way in which the laws intended for their\r\ndefence were evaded; from the evidence of the brothers Ulloa, who were\r\ncommissioned to make a special and secret report on the subject to the\r\nKing of Spain in 1740.[171] I have since collected abundant testimony\r\nto the same effect, printed and in manuscript, both at Madrid and in\r\nPeru; but I have only space for a few brief notes, which must serve to\r\nillustrate this part of the subject.\r\n\r\nThe mines of Potosi were supplied with labourers from the nearest\r\nprovinces, by enforcing a _mita_ of a seventh of the adult male\r\npopulation. In 1573 this _mita_ consisted of 11,199 Indians, in\r\n1620 of 4249, and in 1678 of 1674,[172] a decrease which marks the\r\nrapid depopulation of the country; and, at the latter date, when\r\nthe authorities at Potosi failed to receive a sufficient number of\r\nlabourers by the ordinary _mita_, they kidnapped people in their homes,\r\nand on the roads, and carried them off to forced labour in the mines.\r\nThe law was that the _mitayos_ should be paid for coming and going, and\r\nthat they should not be forced to work at night; but these laws were\r\nhabitually set at nought, and Potosi became an exhausting drain to the\r\nsurrounding country.[173]\r\n\r\nThe mines of Huancavelica, which supplied the quicksilver necessary\r\nfor extracting the silver of Potosi from its ores,[174] also desolated\r\nthe ten adjoining provinces. In 1645 the _mita_ or seventh part of the\r\nadult male population amounted to 620, and in 1678 to only 354 Indians.\r\nThe _mita_ was a service which was abhorred and dreaded by the people,\r\nand mothers maimed the arms and legs of their children to deliver them\r\nfrom this slavery. Don Juan de Padilla relates that, in 1657, when he\r\nwas at Santa Lucia, in the province of Lucanas, he saw the women of\r\nthe village go out to assist each other in sowing their fields, and,\r\nat the end of their labour, they returned hand in hand, singing a most\r\nmelancholy song, and lamenting the cruel fate of their husbands and\r\nbrothers, who were slaving in the mines of Huancavelica, while they\r\nwere obliged to work in the fields like men. They declared that when\r\na man was once taken for the _mita_ his wife seldom or never saw him\r\nagain, unless she went herself to the place of his torments.[175]\r\n\r\nThe oppression of the owners of _obrajes_ or manufactories of coarse\r\nwoollen and cotton cloths, in enforcing the _mitas_, was as crushing\r\nas that of the miners. These people employed men, called _guatacos_,\r\nto hunt the Indians, and drive them into the _obrajes_. If they could\r\nnot find the particular men for whom they were in search, they took\r\ntheir children, wives, and nearest neighbours, robbed them of all they\r\npossessed, and frequently violated the women and young girls.[176] The\r\nmasters, in the _obrajes_, then forced their victims to get deeply in\r\ndebt to them, and thus obtained an excuse for keeping them in perpetual\r\nslavery. In many _obrajes_ there were Indians who had not been outside\r\nthe walls for forty years and upwards. The law was that the natives\r\nshould be free from tribute and personal service until they attained\r\nthe age of eighteen; but it was the general practice to drag children\r\nfrom their homes at the ages of six or eight, force them to work hard\r\nat twisting woollen and cotton threads, and flog them cruelly.[177]\r\n\r\nThus the work of depopulation went on until, in 1622, many\r\n_encomiendas_ which originally contained a thousand adult male Indians,\r\nand yielded eight thousand dollars of tribute, were reduced to a\r\nhundred; yet these unfortunate survivors were forced to continue the\r\npayment of the original tribute, or to render personal service instead.\r\nThere was an _encomienda_ in Huanuco where the Indians had paid more\r\nthan one hundred thousand dollars over and above what was legally due,\r\nduring fifty years.[178]\r\n\r\nIt may well be asked of what use were the humane and beneficent laws\r\nenacted by the kings of Spain if this was the way in which they were\r\nuniversally evaded by corregidors, curas, and Spanish settlers of all\r\nranks? The caciques sorrowfully watched the gradual extinction of their\r\npeople, perhaps secretly hoped for an opportunity of revenge, but were\r\nwithout power to prevent the cruel oppression which they deplored,\r\nthough they did not neglect, from time to time, to protest against the\r\nlawless exactions and cruelties of the Spaniards.[179]\r\n\r\nBut the Indians did not endure their fate without occasional attempts\r\nat resistance. On one occasion the people on the western shore of lake\r\nTiticaca rose against the _mita_ of Potosi, and retreated amongst\r\nthe beds of rushes on the shores of the lake, which, in some places,\r\nare nine leagues long and one broad. In the midst of these rushes\r\nthere was an island, whence secret lanes were cut through the tangled\r\nmass, which the fugitives navigated in their balsas. Secure in their\r\nretreat, they continued to make inroads on the Spanish towns near the\r\nlake, until at last, in 1632, the viceroy Count of Chinchon ordered\r\nhis nephew, Don Rodrigo de Castro, to chastise them. Five of their\r\nleaders were captured and hung at Zepita, and their heads were stuck\r\non the bridge over the Desaguadero. This only exasperated the Indians,\r\nwho elected a brave and enterprising leader named Pedro Laime, and,\r\nsuddenly attacking the bridge over the Desaguadero, they carried off\r\nthe heads of their former chiefs. The Spaniards marched along the shore\r\nand waded to some islets, while the Indians hovered round them in\r\ntheir balsas, and prevented them from advancing further. At length the\r\nSpanish troops were embarked in twenty balsas, and came in sight of the\r\nhostile squadron commanded by Laime. The Indians went in and out of\r\nthe lanes of rushes only known to themselves, baffled their oppressors,\r\nand cut off several of the Spanish balsas. A party of cavalry advancing\r\ninto the swampy ground was suddenly surrounded and cut to pieces, the\r\nIndians only losing three men.[180]\r\n\r\nThus the fugitive Indians retained their liberty for many years in\r\nthese inaccessible fastnesses of lake Titicaca, and the Augustine friar\r\nCalancha confesses that \"the rebellion was caused by the injustice and\r\ntyranny of the Spaniards, who forced the Indians to work without pay,\r\nand seized on their goods.\"\r\n\r\nThis was not a solitary instance of rebellion, though, on the whole,\r\nthe Indians endured their cruel fate with meekness and long suffering.\r\nYet they are not a mean-spirited people, and at length they showed\r\ntheir oppressors that it was possible to press the yoke down too hard\r\neven for their powers of endurance.\r\n\r\nThe tribute, the _mita_, the exactions of the curas, and the\r\n_alcabala_, or excise duties,[181] were all patiently borne;\r\nbut another method of extortion, the \"_repartimiento_,\" or\r\n\"_reparto_,\"[182] at length exhausted the patience of the over-tasked\r\nIndians. The _reparto_ was a system, ostensibly for distributing\r\nEuropean goods to the Indians, which was converted into a means of\r\nwholesale robbery by the Spanish corregidors, and finally led to a\r\ngeneral rebellion. An Indian chieftain thus describes the _reparto_\r\nsystem:--\"Abandoning their souls for their avarice, the corregidors\r\nhave the assurance to distribute (_repartir_) by force, and against\r\nall reason, baize and cloths worth two rials for one dollar, and in\r\nthe same proportion with knives, needles, dice, pins, cards, trumpets,\r\nrings, and pewter mirrors, which are all quite useless to the Indians;\r\nbesides velvets and silks, which the poor people cannot use; for they\r\nare obliged to dress in the coarsest clothes, to sleep on beds of\r\nrags, and feed on roots; while the corregidors and their dependants\r\ncommit the most unjust extortions and outrages. They even exceed the\r\nlegal quantity of _repartos_ assigned to their respective provinces;\r\nfor example, that of Tinta was ordered to be 112,500 dollars, and the\r\ncorregidor made it 500,000 dollars, as was proved by his books and\r\npapers.\"[183] General del Valle, who commanded the troops employed to\r\nput down Tupac Amaru's rebellion, complained that the avarice of the\r\ncorregidors, in recovering their claims on the Indians for _repartos_,\r\nwas such that they refused him the aid of their people in pacifying the\r\ncountry. Their obstinacy and avarice, he declared, had reached to such\r\na point that, if they were informed that the rebels had reached the\r\nvery suburbs of their towns, they would rather see the defeat of the\r\nking's troops than send away a single Indian who might owe them a yard\r\nof cloth.[184]\r\n\r\nThis unblushing dishonesty and extortion, which was winked at by the\r\nRoyal Audience at Lima, the highest court of judicial appeal, drove\r\nthe Indian population to a state of desperation, which only required a\r\nspark to set it in a blaze. The humane laws, and the elaborate system\r\nof legislation for the Indians, had, after 200 years of hopeless\r\ninefficiency, ended in this. The careful enactments to limit the amount\r\nof tribute, to prevent the Indians from suffering by forced personal\r\nservice, the laws of ecclesiastical councils to protect them from the\r\nexactions of the curas, the benevolent intentions evinced in declaring\r\nall Indians to be minors in the eye of the law, the \"_residencias_,\"\r\nor arrangements for examining the conduct of every official at the\r\nclose of his term of office; all these provisions, which have justly\r\ncalled forth the praise of Mr. Helps, Mr. Merivale,[185] and other\r\nmodern writers, had become dead letters, absolutely and hopelessly,\r\ntowards the end of the last century. The laws remained the same,\r\nbut they were habitually set aside by those whose duty it was to\r\nadminister them. The tribute fixed for villages when they contained a\r\nthousand men was continued the same when the population had decreased\r\nto a hundred;[186] the _mita_ was enforced so mercilessly that whole\r\ndistricts were left without a single adult male inhabitant;[187] the\r\ncuras extorted exorbitant fees from their victims, in spite of the\r\nlaw;[188] and the judges, who were sent to take the \"_residencias_,\"\r\nreceived bribes to overlook all offences, and usually handed over the\r\ncomplaints which were submitted to them to the officials who were\r\ncomplained of in exchange for a sum of money, the price of their\r\nsilence.[189] These evils were long borne patiently; but when the\r\nshameless enormities of the _Repartos_ were superadded, the poor\r\nremnant of the descendants of the subjects of the Incas at length rose\r\nas one man against their oppressors.\r\n\r\nThere were not wanting, amongst the Spaniards in Peru, as well as\r\namongst the native Caciques, many good and humane men who raised their\r\nvoices against the lawless cruelty of the majority of the officials,\r\nand earnestly warned the Government of the inevitable consequences.\r\nDon Ventura Santalices, the Governor of La Paz, devoted his time and\r\nfortune to the cause of the oppressed Indians, and was appointed to\r\na seat in the Council of the Indies, but he was poisoned on his\r\narrival in Spain: the energetic remonstrances of Blas Tupac Amaru, a\r\ndescendant of the Incas, caused him also to be summoned to Spain, where\r\nhe obtained promises of many concessions, but he was assassinated at\r\nsea, during the return voyage: and the names of other bold and fearless\r\ndefenders of the Indians deserve to be recorded, such as Don Manuel\r\nArroyo, Don Ignacio Castro, Don Agustin de Gurruchategui, Bishop of\r\nCuzco, and Don Francisco Campos, Bishop of La Paz.\r\n\r\nBut their remonstrances bore no fruit, and, in 1780, the Corregidor of\r\nChayanta having exacted three _repartos_ in one year, an Indian chief,\r\nnamed Tomas Catari, set the example of revolt; thousands flocked to\r\nhis standard, and to those of his brothers Damaso and Nicolas; in a\r\nfew months the whole of Upper Peru (the modern Bolivia) was in revolt,\r\nand an army of Indians under Julian Apasa, a baker of Hayohayo near\r\nSicasica, besieged La Paz.[190] At the same time there was an uneasy\r\nfeeling at Cuzco and throughout Peru, and whispers of a conspiracy\r\namongst the Indians. Don Pedro Sahuaraura, the Cacique of Oropesa, near\r\nCuzco, reported that one Ildefonso del Castillo had solicited him to\r\njoin the conspiracy; suspicion was thrown on several other influential\r\nIndians; and in June 1780 this Castillo, Bernardo Tambohuacto, the\r\nCacique of Pissac, and six others, were put to death at Cuzco.[191] In\r\nthe following November the Cacique José Gabriel Condorcanqui, better\r\nknown as Tupac Amaru, raised the standard of revolt, and the last\r\ndesperate struggle for liberty was commenced by the descendant of the\r\nIncas.[192]\r\n\r\n\"It would be difficult,\" says Dean Funes, \"to find in the history of\r\nrevolutions one more justifiable and less fortunate than that of\r\nTupac Amaru. America had, in those days, become the theatre of the\r\nmost wide-spread tyranny; but the Indians of Peru were those on whose\r\nnecks the yoke weighed heaviest. _Mitas_ and _repartos_ were, in Peru,\r\nthe deadly plagues of Spanish invention, which devoured the human\r\nrace.\"[193]\r\n\r\nI am enabled to give a more correct and circumstantial account of the\r\ngreat rising of the Peruvian Indians in the end of the last century\r\nthan has yet appeared in Europe; although, as this interesting subject\r\nis a digression from the main purpose of the present work, I shall be\r\nobliged to compress my narrative within the narrow limits of one or\r\ntwo chapters.[194] In this brief sketch of the state of the Peruvian\r\nIndians under Spanish rule, I have endeavoured to establish the fact\r\nthat Tupac Amaru's rebellion was justified because the oppression\r\nof his people had become intolerable, and because all law was set\r\nat defiance by the Spanish officials. He protested, not against the\r\ntyranny of the laws, but against the infringement of laws, and the\r\noppressive acts done in spite of the laws, by those whose duty it was\r\nto administer them.\r\n\r\nIn writing on this subject one is apt to be carried away by indignation\r\nagainst the Spanish rulers in South America; yet, if we look round at\r\nthe systems of colonization pursued by other European nations, it will\r\nbe found difficult to say who has a right to cast the first stone.\r\nThe Spanish colonies, however, cannot properly be compared with those\r\nmodern English settlements, to which thousands of the labouring classes\r\nhave emigrated, and either annihilated the natives, or fenced them off\r\nby a system of reserves and isolation. No European labouring class was\r\nintroduced into South America; the Indians still continued to be the\r\ncultivators, the shepherds, and the artizans; and the Spaniards were\r\nmerely the dominant race. This state of things is more allied to the\r\nconditions which now exist in British India or Dutch Java, and there is\r\nthus no analogy between the South American settlements and any British\r\ncolony in the proper acceptation of the word.\r\n\r\nYet to Spain the credit is due, in spite of numerous shortcomings,\r\nand notwithstanding the oppression of her subordinates, of having\r\nendeavoured to establish the wisest, the most humane, and the only\r\nsuccessful system of treating natives of an inferior race. It is\r\ncertain that such a race must either continue to form the mass of the\r\npopulation, amalgamate with their conquerors, or be annihilated. The\r\ntwo former of these three alternatives were adopted in Peru, partly\r\nfrom natural causes, but partly also owing to the incessant exertions\r\nof the earlier Spanish viceroys, and of the \"Defenders of the Indians;\"\r\nand this result was achieved in spite of the oppression and cruelty of\r\ntheir subordinates. The Indians have continued to form the labouring\r\nclass of Peru; amalgamation has taken place, to a very large extent,\r\nwith Europeans; and the native race has thus been preserved from\r\nextinction.[195] In the English colonies, on the other hand, owing\r\nto the influx of settlers of the labouring class, the aborigines\r\nhave either been exterminated, or, through a system of isolation,\r\nare rapidly and inevitably advancing on the melancholy road to final\r\nannihilation.\r\n\r\nBut it was the intention of the Spanish system to do more for the\r\naboriginal race than merely to preserve it from extinction. By\r\nadopting a system of tutelage, as regarded the Indians, the Spanish\r\nGovernment endeavoured to defend them, in legal matters, from the\r\nsuperior intelligence of a more civilized race; and Mr. Helps points\r\nout that it is hardly possible to carry legislation further, in favour\r\nof any people, than by considering them as minors in the eye of the\r\nlaw, in order to protect them from being imposed upon in their dealings\r\nwith their conquerors.[196] The opposite plan, which has been adopted\r\nin some of the English colonies, of making native tribes equal to\r\nEuropeans in the eye of the law, is a mere mockery, and cannot by any\r\npossibility exist in reality.[197]\r\n\r\nIt may then be readily allowed that the intentions of the Spanish\r\nGovernment towards the Indians were humane and just; that their\r\nlegislation was invariably marked by tenderness and concern for the\r\nsubject race; and that their policy, had it been carried into effect,\r\nwas far more wise and generous than that by which modern nations\r\nhave generally been influenced in dealing with the aborigines of\r\ntheir colonies. But I think I have clearly shown that, through the\r\nunworthiness of their subordinates, this policy was only very partially\r\nenforced; that the cruelty and oppression of the colonial officials at\r\nlength became insufferable; and that no cause could be more just than\r\nthat in which Tupac Amaru, the last of the Incas, at length drew his\r\nsword.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nNARRATIVE OF THE INSURRECTION OF JOSÉ GABRIEL TUPAC AMARU, THE LAST OF\r\nTHE INCAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE basin of lake Titicaca is bounded on the north by the mountains\r\nof Vilcañota, which unite the maritime cordillera with the Eastern\r\nAndes, and the river of Vilcamayu rises in these mountains, and flows\r\nnorth through a fertile and well-peopled valley, which is covered with\r\nfields of Indian corn. The road from Puno to Cuzco, after crossing the\r\nVilcañota range by the pass of Santa Rosa, descends the valley of the\r\nVilcamayu, passing through the towns of Marangani, Sicuani, Cacha,\r\nTinta, Checacupe, Quiquijana, and Urcos; and then leaves the river\r\nnear Oropesa, and ascends a valley for three leagues to the city of\r\nCuzco. On either side of the ravine of Vilcamayu are lofty table-lands,\r\nwhich only yield potatoes and quinoa; the wild hills are covered with\r\ncoarse grass, often weighed down with snow; and in several places\r\nthere are large Alpine lakes. Uninviting as this bleak region appears,\r\nit still contains several Indian villages, ruled in 1780 by native\r\ncaciques, who were subject to the corregidor of Tinta, in the valley.\r\nThe principal villages under the jurisdiction of Tinta in this cold and\r\nlofty district are Sangarara, Lanqui, Pampamarca, Surimani, Yanaoca,\r\nand Tungasuca--the latter of which was the home of Tupac Amaru. It is a\r\nsmall village, with a few patches of potatoes and quinoa round it, near\r\nthe banks of a wild-looking lake, with rocky mountains rising abruptly\r\nfrom the water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FAMILY OF THE INCAS OF PERU.\r\nArms of the Incas, granted by Charles V., A.D. 1544.\r\n_Tierce in fess: on a chief azure, a Sun with glory or: on a fess vert,\r\nan eagle displayed between a rainbow and two serpents proper: and on a\r\nbase gules, a castle proper._   _To face page 134._]\r\n\r\nJosé Gabriel Condorcanqui or Tupac Amaru,[198] the son of the Cacique\r\nMiguel Tupac Amaru by his wife Rosa Noguera, was born at Tinta in\r\nthe year 1742, and baptized at Tungasuca, the birthplace of his\r\nfather.[199] He claimed to be the representative of the family of the\r\nIncas, as fifth in lineal descent from Tupac Amaru, the son of the Inca\r\nManco, who was judicially murdered by the Viceroy Toledo in 1571.\r\n\r\nThe young José received the first rudiments of his education from two\r\nneighbouring clergymen, Antonio Lopez, Cura of Pampamarca, a native\r\nof Panama, and a man of considerable talent; and Carlos Rodriguez,\r\nCura of Yanaoca, a native of Guayaquil. At a very early age, however,\r\nhe was sent to the Jesuit college of San Borja at Cuzco, which had\r\nbeen established for the education of young Indian chiefs. He is said\r\nto have been particularly noticed by the professors for his close\r\napplication, capacity, and excellent disposition; and his scholastic\r\nacquirements were not inconsiderable. He spoke Spanish with fluent\r\naccuracy, and his vernacular Quichua with peculiar grace.[200]\r\n\r\nBefore he was twenty he succeeded his father as Cacique of Tungasuca,\r\nPampamarca, and Surimani, three villages situated on the cold and lofty\r\nregion which overhangs the valley of the Vilcamayu; and in 1760 he was\r\nmarried to Micaela Bastidas, a beautiful Indian girl of Abancay.[201]\r\n\r\nIn person José Tupac Amaru was five feet eight inches in height,\r\nwell-proportioned, sinewy, and firmly knit. He had a handsome Indian\r\nface, a slightly aquiline nose, full black eyes, and altogether\r\na countenance intelligent, benign, and expressive. His address,\r\nremarkable for gentlemanlike ease, was dignified and courteous towards\r\nsuperiors and equals; but in his intercourse with the aborigines,\r\nby whom he was profoundly venerated, there was a sedateness not\r\ninconsistent with his legally-admitted claims (de jure) to the diadem\r\nof the Incas. In mind he was enterprising, cool, and persevering.\r\nHe lived in a style becoming his rank, and, when residing at Cuzco,\r\nusually wore a black velvet coat and small-clothes in the fashion of\r\nthe day, a waistcoat of gold tissue, embroidered linen, a Spanish\r\nbeaver dress hat, silk stockings, and gold knee and shoe-buckles, and\r\nhe allowed his glossy black hair to flow in ringlets which extended\r\ndown nearly to his waist.[202] The chief source of his income arose\r\nfrom thirty-five _piaras_ or troops of mules, each _piara_ consisting\r\nof ten, which were regularly employed or hired out in the transport of\r\nmerchandise, home-made stuffs, sugar, and quicksilver to Potosi and\r\nother parts.[203] He had travelled over a considerable portion of\r\nPeru, and had two or three times resided in Lima; and in his journeys\r\nhe was always attended by a small retinue of Indians, and sometimes\r\naccompanied by a chaplain.\r\n\r\nIn about 1770 Tupac Amaru went to Lima to establish his claim to the\r\nMarquisate of Oropesa, which had been granted to his family by Philip\r\nII. After some delay his claim was acknowledged by the Royal Audience,\r\nand, in a judgment pronounced by the Fiscal Don Serafin Leytan y Mola,\r\nhe was declared to be the heir to the marquisate, as fifth in lineal\r\ndescent from the Inca Tupac Amaru; but it would appear that this\r\njudgment was withheld from official publication. It was said that the\r\nfiscal paid the successful suitor so many honours, and said so many\r\ncomplimentary things concerning his nobility and royal descent, that he\r\ngrew proud;[204] and it certainly appears that he adopted a style of\r\nliving in his mountain home at Tungasuca, after his return from Lima,\r\nwhich he had not previously assumed.[205] It is remarkable that, in\r\n1618, the Viceroy Prince of Esquilache wrote a despatch on the claims\r\nto jurisdiction of the members of the Inca family, who were heirs to\r\nthe marquisate of Oropesa. He represented that very great inconvenience\r\nmight arise from any descendant of the Incas, particularly of the\r\nfamily of Oropesa, so closely representing the direct line, holding any\r\njurisdiction in Peru. The estates of the marquisate were the richest\r\nand best in Peru, and situated near Cuzco, where the memory of the\r\nIncas was most cherished. Many descendants of the Incas, he added,\r\nwere then living, subject to no tribute and no personal service, and\r\nvery rich and powerful; and he recommended that all claimants to the\r\nmarquisate should be obliged to live in Spain, and that an equivalent\r\nshould be paid them for their estates.[206] This advice was not adopted\r\nby the Council of the Indies.\r\n\r\nThe young Inca at this time dropped his surname of Condorcanqui,\r\nand assumed that of Tupac Amaru Inca. He governed his villages of\r\nTungasuca, Surinani, and Pampamarca exceedingly well, and was highly\r\nesteemed by the corregidor of the province, Don Pedro Muñoz de Arjona,\r\nand his successors, who admired his punctual attention to his duty, and\r\ntherefore distinguished him above all the other caciques. He habitually\r\ncultivated the acquaintance of the Spanish curas and officials, and\r\nnever let pass an opportunity of representing to them, in impassioned\r\nlanguage, the deplorable condition of the Indians.[207] He assisted the\r\ndistressed, paid tribute for the poor, and sustained whole families\r\nwhich had been reduced to ruin.[208] He cherished the traditions\r\nof his people, and such customs as were not inconsistent with his\r\nprofession of Christianity; and he especially delighted in the dramatic\r\nrepresentations which recalled the glorious memories of the past. One\r\nof his most intimate friends was Dr. Antonio Valdez, Cura of Sicuani,\r\na perfect master of the Quichua language, and author of a play called\r\n'Ollantay,' founded on ancient tradition, which was frequently acted\r\nbefore Tupac Amaru at Tungasuca.[209]\r\n\r\nThe oppression of the Indians by means of the _mitas_ and _repartos_\r\nexcited the indignation of the Inca Tupac Amaru; but he exerted\r\nhimself for years, and exhausted every means of obtaining redress,\r\nbefore he was finally driven to take up arms in their defence. Moved\r\nby his earnest and incessant appeals, and his piteous account of the\r\nsufferings of his people, the Bishops of Cuzco and La Paz forwarded\r\nthem to the king through Don Ventura Santalices; and Blas Tupac Amaru,\r\nthe Inca's uncle, also undertook a voyage to Spain; but death put\r\nan end to the humane missions both of the Spaniard and the Indian.\r\nNevertheless, Tupac Amaru persevered in remitting renewed petitions;\r\nwhile the corregidors not only eluded compliance with the royal\r\ndecrees, but also increased the burdens of the Indians. At length his\r\npatience came to an end, and he resolved to make an appeal to arms, not\r\nto throw off the yoke of Spain, but to obtain some guarantee for the\r\ndue observance of the laws, and their just administration. His views\r\nwere certainly confined to these ends when he first drew his sword,\r\nalthough afterwards, when his moderate demands were only answered by\r\ncruel taunts and brutal menaces, he saw that independence or death were\r\nthe only alternatives.\r\n\r\nThe most merciless oppressor of the Indians of Peru was Don Antonio\r\nAliaga, Corregidor of Tinta, and therefore Tupac Amaru's immediate\r\nsuperior; and the Inca determined to commence his revolt by punishing\r\nthis great culprit. The Inca's old tutor, Dr. Carlos Rodriguez, Cura\r\nof Yanaoca, in celebration of his name-day, gave a dinner to the\r\ncorregidor of Tinta, and the Inca Tupac Amaru, on the 4th of November,\r\n1780. The Inca, on pretence that some person had arrived at his house\r\nfrom Cuzco, withdrew from the banquet early, and placing himself in\r\nambush on the road, with some attendants, made the corregidor prisoner\r\non his return, taking him to Tungasuca,[211] and placing him in close\r\nconfinement. Tupac then wrote a letter marked _reservadissima_, which\r\nhe obliged Aliaga to sign, ordering his cashier at Tinta to remit the\r\npublic money in the provincial treasury to the Inca, assigning as\r\na reason that it was necessary to set out forthwith to the port of\r\nAranta,[212] threatened by a descent from English cruisers. The Inca\r\nthus received 22,000 dollars, some gold ingots, seventy-five muskets,\r\nbaggage-horses, and mules. Recruits were also ordered to be embodied,\r\nand sent to Tungasuca.\r\n\r\nHaving thus drawn together a considerable force, he sent for his old\r\nmaster, Dr. Antonio Lopez, the Cura of Pampamarca,[213] and ordered him\r\nto make known to the corregidor that he must die, and to administer\r\nto him the consolations of religion. A scaffold was then erected in\r\nthe plaza of Tungasuca, around which the retainers of the Inca were\r\nranged in three ranks, the first armed with muskets, the second with\r\npikes, and the rear rank with treble-loaded slings. Aliaga was then led\r\nout and publicly executed on November 10th. Tupac Amaru at the same\r\ntime addressed the astonished multitude, in Quichua, as to his present\r\nconduct and ulterior views. Mounted on a fiery charger, attired in the\r\nprincely costume of his ancestors, with a banner bearing the figure of\r\nan Inca encircled by embroidered chains of gold and silver, and two\r\narmorial serpents,[214] he exhorted his followers to lend an attentive\r\near to the legitimate descendant of their ancient sovereigns, promising\r\nto abolish the _mitas_ and _repartos_, and to punish the extortionate\r\ncorregidors.\r\n\r\nThe whole multitude, with one accord, vowed implicit obedience to\r\nhis orders, and he at once began to form the Indians into companies,\r\nand to nominate officers. Next day he marched to Quiquijana, in the\r\nvalley of the Vilcamayu, the capital of the province of Quispicanchi,\r\nwhich he entered at daybreak on the 12th, but the corregidor had fled.\r\nAfter hearing mass Tupac returned towards Tungasuca, destroying the\r\n_obraje_ of Parapuquio on his way, where he found large quantities\r\nof woollen clothes, which were distributed amongst his followers. He\r\nalso demolished the _obraje_ of Pumacancha, where he found property\r\nvalued at 200,000 dollars, consisting of 18,000 yards of woollen cloths\r\n(_bayeta_), 60,000 of cotton cloths (_tocuyo_), some fire-arms, and two\r\npieces of artillery, belonging to the Corregidor of Quispicanchi.[215]\r\nThese _obrajes_ were odious to the Indians, their owners having\r\nenforced the _mita_ far beyond the limits assigned by the law, and\r\nperpetrated great cruelties on the women and children of the _mitayos_.\r\nThe Inca had now mustered 6000 troops, 300 armed with muskets, and the\r\nrest with pikes, clubs, and slings. Nearly the whole population of the\r\nprovinces of Tinta, Quispicanchi, Cotabambas, Calca, and Chumbivilicas\r\nrose in his favour, with the exception of a few whites.\r\n\r\nThe news of Tupac Amaru's revolt was brought to Cuzco on the 12th, by\r\nCabrera, the Corregidor of Quispicanchi, who had so narrowly escaped\r\ncapture. It created the greatest alarm, as the city was only garrisoned\r\nby two regiments. The college of the expelled Jesuits was turned into a\r\nkind of citadel, into which private and public property was taken for\r\nsecurity; the white part of the population was enrolled; requisitions\r\nfor troops were sent to the neighbouring provinces; and an express was\r\ndespatched to Lima, imploring speedy succour.\r\n\r\nNext day 450 men, under the command of Don Tiburcio de Landa, Governor\r\nof Paurcartambo, marched out of Cuzco, accompanied by the Cacique\r\nof Oropesa, Juan Sahuaraura, with 700 Indians of his _ayllu_, or\r\ntribe. Landa was ordered to wait for reinforcements at a place called\r\nHuayra-pata; but the Corregidor Don Fernando Cabrera, who accompanied\r\nhim, enraged at the loss of property which he had sustained, induced\r\nhim to advance to the village of Sangarara, within five leagues of\r\nTinta, which he reached on the 17th. At dawn on the following morning\r\nit began to snow, and, finding himself surrounded by a superior force\r\nof hostile Indians, Landa retreated into the church. Tupac Amaru\r\nthen wrote to him, offering terms, which were refused; and he again\r\nwrote to the cura, who was also in the church, urging him to retire\r\nwith the women and children. The Spanish troops, however, prevented\r\nthem from coming out, a scuffle ensued, the stock of powder ignited,\r\nand the roof and one of the walls were blown out. The Spaniards\r\nthen made a dash forward, and fought bravely until they were nearly\r\nall killed.[216] Only twenty-eight wounded remained, who were cured\r\nand set at liberty by order of the Inca. Landa,[217] his lieutenant\r\nEscajadillo, Cabrera, and the Cacique Sahuaraura[218] were amongst the\r\nslain.\r\n\r\nThe news of the disaster at Sangarara reached Cuzco on the 19th, and\r\nproduced indescribable confusion. The Cabildo immediately began to\r\ncollect arms, make powder, repair six old field-pieces, and on the\r\n20th Don Juan Nicolas de Lobaton y Zavala, Marquis of Rocafuerte,\r\narrived from Urubamba with reinforcements. Every citizen came forward\r\nto serve, and a corps of volunteers was formed under Don Faustino\r\nAlvarez de Foronda, Count of Vallehermoso. The Bishop ordered all the\r\nclergy to assemble, formed them into four companies, and gave the\r\ncommand to the Dean, Dr. Manuel de Mendieta. More troops soon came\r\nin from Calca, under Don Pablo Astete, and from other parts, and by\r\nthe end of November there were 3000 men in arms at Cuzco. Anxious to\r\npacify the Indians, the Cabildo then issued a proclamation abolishing\r\nthe _repartos_, and the _alcabala_, or excise on provisions, and\r\ndeclaring that the Indians should never again be forced to work in the\r\n_obrajes_, if they remained faithful. Defensive works were thrown up in\r\nthe city and suburbs, and religious processions paraded the streets.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Tupac Amaru might probably have entered Cuzco without\r\nopposition; but unfortunately, relying on the justice of his cause, he\r\nbeguiled himself into the belief that he could accomplish by argument\r\nand negotiation what could only be obtained by the sword. He threw\r\nup embankments and entrenched himself in an encampment near Tinta,\r\nthrowing out videttes to within three leagues of Cuzco; and on the\r\n27th he issued an edict from his head-quarters at Tungasuca, setting\r\nforth the causes of his revolt. In this document he recapitulated the\r\ngrievances which his people suffered, declared the tyranny of the\r\nSpanish officials to be impious and cruel, and called upon the Indians\r\nto rally round his standard.\r\n\r\nEarly in December 1780 Tupac Amaru crossed the Vilcañota range, by the\r\npass of Santa Rosa, and, entering the Collao, advanced by Pucara to\r\nLampa. At every village he addressed the people from the church-steps,\r\nsaying that he came to abolish abuses and punish the corregidors; and\r\nthat he was \"the liberator of the kingdom, the restorer of privileges,\r\nand the common father of those who groan under the yoke of _repartos_.\"\r\nNothing was heard amongst the Indians but acclamations for their Inca\r\nand Redeemer.[219] On the 13th of December he entered the town of\r\nAzangaro, where he destroyed the houses of the Cacique Chuquihuanca,\r\nwho had refused to join the insurrection. A private letter, dated\r\nJanuary 1781,[220] says that he rode into Azangaro on a white horse,\r\nwith splendidly-embroidered trappings, and that two fair men, like\r\nEnglishmen, of commanding aspect, were on his right and left. He was\r\narmed with a gun, sword, and pistols, and was dressed in blue velvet,\r\nrichly embroidered with gold, with a three-cornered hat, and an _uncu_,\r\nin the shape of a bishop's rochet, over all, with a gold chain round\r\nhis neck, to which a large golden sun was attached. Having received\r\nrepeated letters from his wife, reporting the threatening assembly of\r\ntroops at Cuzco, he retraced his steps, by Asillo and Orurillo, to the\r\nvalley of the Vilcamayu, obliging the curas of the villages through\r\nwhich he passed to receive him in their churches under a canopy, and to\r\nchant the _Te Deum_.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th the heights of Picchu, overhanging Cuzco on the west,\r\nwere covered with his army. His cousin Diego Tupac Amaru was detached\r\nto the eastward with 6000 men, to occupy the provinces of Calca and\r\nPaucartambo. Another detachment under Antonio Castelo, one of the\r\nInca's most trusted followers, marched along the direct road to Cuzco,\r\nbut was defeated two leagues from the city at a place called Saylla,\r\nand finally effected a junction with the main body on the heights of\r\nPicchu.\r\n\r\nBefore attempting to force his way into Cuzco, the Inca addressed\r\na letter to the cabildo, and another to the bishop, on the 3rd of\r\nJanuary, 1781. To the cabildo he said that, as the heir of the Incas,\r\nthe ancient kings of the realm, he was stimulated to endeavour by all\r\npossible means to put an end to abuses, and to see men appointed to\r\ngovern the Indians who would respect the laws of the King of Spain.\r\nThe punishment of the Corregidor of Tinta was, he declared, absolutely\r\nnecessary as an example to others: and he announced the object of his\r\nrebellion to be the entire abolition of _repartos_; the appointment of\r\nan _alcalde mayor_, or judge of the Indian nation, in every province;\r\nand the establishment of an _audiencia_ or court of appeal at Cuzco,\r\nwithin reach of the Indians. \"This,\" he concluded, \"is at present\r\nthe extent of my wishes, leaving to the King of Spain his former\r\ndominion.\" To the bishop he said that he had come forward, on behalf\r\nof the whole nation, to put an end to the robberies and outrages of\r\nthe corregidors; and he promised to respect the priests, all church\r\nproperty, and all women and inoffensive unarmed people.[221]\r\n\r\nBut the garrison of Cuzco had, in the mean while, been reinforced by\r\nPumacagua, the Cacique of Chinchero, and by 200 mulatto soldiers from\r\nLima under Don Gabriel de Aviles, who arrived by forced marches on\r\nJanuary 1st. The cabildo, therefore, refused to entertain any proposals\r\nfrom the Inca. The Spaniards came out to attack him under Don Pablo\r\nAstete, and the Caciques of Chinchero and Anta, Pumacagua and Rosas.\r\nThere was a long skirmish in the broken ground, which was brought to\r\na conclusion by the evening snow; but on the 8th a sanguinary battle\r\nwas fought in the suburbs and on the heights, which lasted two days,\r\nand during which a Dominican friar, named Ramon de Salazar, concealed\r\nbehind a rock, did effective service with his musket, and contributed\r\nto throw the Indians into confusion. The Inca finally retreated to\r\nTinta, to re-organize his forces.\r\n\r\nHis cousin Diego Tupac Amaru was also unsuccessful to the eastward.\r\nHis division was detached from the main army at Checacupe, where\r\nhe crossed some mountainous country, and again descended into the\r\nvalley of the Vilcamayu, following the course of the river until he\r\nencountered the forces under the command of the Marquis of Rocafuerte,\r\nconsisting of the levies of Pumacagua, Cacique of Chinchero, and those\r\nof the Caciques of Maras and Huayllabamba. An engagement took place at\r\nHuaran, on the banks of the river, near Calca, when Diego was defeated,\r\nmany of his Indians being drowned in the river; and he again suffered\r\ndefeat at Yucay on December 23rd. The Indian chief then left the valley\r\nof the Vilcamayu, crossed a range of mountains, and laid siege to\r\nthe town of Paucartambo, on the banks of the rapid river of the same\r\nname, while his videttes hovered over the heights above the Vilcamayu\r\nvalley, threatening the towns of Calca, Pissac, and Taray. Don José\r\nAntonio Vivar was sent to occupy the bridge at Urubamba, and watch\r\nthe movements of the Indians. Paucartambo, and a strong fort built on\r\na rocky height on the opposite side of the river, were desperately\r\ndefended by the Spaniards under Don Lorenzo Lechuga, who had fortified\r\nand garrisoned the place. Astete was sent across the bridge at\r\nUrubamba, with 400 men, to relieve it; they had several encounters with\r\nthe Indians on the march, and on reaching the besieged town they found\r\nthat Lechuga had expended all his ammunition; but the besieging force,\r\nunder Diego Tupac Amaru, fell back towards Tinta, on the approach of\r\nAstete, on the 18th of January, 1781. Having re-organized his army at\r\nTinta, the Inca, accompanied by his cousin Diego, made another attack\r\nupon Paucartambo on the 11th of February; but, after several fruitless\r\nassaults, the Indian army finally retreated to Tinta on the 14th.[222]\r\n\r\nTupac Amaru had now assembled a force of 60,000 men in and around\r\nTinta; but they were wholly undisciplined, and only a few hundreds\r\nwere armed with muskets. All the caciques in Peru, with the exception\r\nof sixteen,[223] had, however, declared in favour of the Inca; and the\r\nwhole Indian and mestizo population, except the _ayllus_ or tribes of\r\nthe sixteen Hispanicized caciques, longed earnestly for the success of\r\nthis truly national insurrection. After the retreat from Paucartambo\r\nin February, the Inca occupied himself in strengthening his position\r\nround Tinta, and in visiting the distant provinces of Chuquibamba and\r\nCotabambas, while one Isidro Mamani, an Indian of ferocious character,\r\nborn at Pomata, on the banks of lake Titicaca, Pedro Vargas, and Andres\r\nIngaricona, held the open country in the Collao.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the interior of Central and Upper Peru was in revolt, and\r\nthe viceroys of Peru and Buenos Ayres, Don Augustin de Jauregui and Don\r\nJuan José de Vertiz, were thoroughly alarmed. The former despatched\r\nDon José Antonio Areche, as \"visitador,\" with extraordinary judicial\r\npowers, and a force commanded by Don José del Valle as Mariscal del\r\nCampo, to Cuzco; while the latter named Don Ignacio Flores, then\r\nGovernor of Moxos, as commandante-general, to put down the rebellion in\r\nUpper Peru.\r\n\r\nAreche, accompanied by General José del Valle, and Don Benito de la\r\nMatta Linares, a judge of the Royal Audience at Lima, arrived at Cuzco\r\non February 23rd, 1781, where an army of 15,000 men was collected,\r\nconsisting of the tribes of the recreant caciques, negroes and mulattos\r\nfrom the coast, and a small force of Spaniards.\r\n\r\nEarly in March General del Valle prepared to commence the campaign.\r\nBut, before his army marched out of Cuzco, the visitador Areche\r\nreceived a letter from Tupac Amaru, in which he represented the\r\nearnest endeavours he had made to obtain justice for his people; the\r\nhabitual violation of the law by the Spanish officials; the cruel and\r\nintolerable oppression caused by the _repartimentos_ and the _mita_;\r\nand the absolute necessity of some reform in the administration. He\r\nconcluded by proposing a negotiation by which these ends might be\r\nattained without bloodshed. This despatch is very ably written, and\r\nis a monument of the noble and enlightened views of this great but\r\nmost unfortunate patriot.[224] The answer of the visitador Areche was\r\na brutal menace, better suited to a follower of Zengis Khan than to a\r\nChristian judge. He refused all negotiation, vowed the most horrible\r\nvengeance, and concluded by saying that, if the Inca surrendered at\r\nonce, the cruelty of the mode of his execution would be lessened. The\r\nSpanish General del Valle protested against the brutality of this\r\nreply.[225]\r\n\r\nTupac Amaru now prepared to resist to the utmost, as it became\r\nevident to him that complete independence or death were the only\r\ntwo alternatives which were left by the barbarous policy of the\r\nbloodthirsty visitador; but his edicts were still marked by humanity\r\nand good sense. It does not appear that he ever actually proclaimed\r\nhimself a sovereign independent of Spain; yet the draft of an edict was\r\nfound amongst his papers, in which he styles himself \"Don José I., by\r\nthe grace of God, Inca, King of Peru, Quito, Chile, Buenos Ayres, and\r\nthe continents of the South Sea, Lord of the River of the Amazons, with\r\ndominion over the Grand Paytiti.\" The document is headed by a portrait\r\nof Tupac Amaru, crowned, with Spanish trophies at his feet. It states\r\nthat the King of Castille had usurped the crown and dominions of Peru,\r\nimposing innumerable taxes, tributes, duties, excises, monopolies,\r\ntithes, fifths; appointing officers who sold justice, and treating\r\nthe people like beasts of burden. For these causes, and by reason of\r\nthe cries which have risen up to Heaven, in the name of Almighty God,\r\nit is ordered that no man shall henceforward pay money to any Spanish\r\nofficer, excepting the tithes to priests; but that tribute shall be\r\npaid to the Inca, and an oath of allegiance to him be taken in every\r\ntown and village. The document is without date.[226]\r\n\r\nOn March 12th, 1781, the army under General del Valle marched out\r\nof Cuzco. A detachment of 2000 men was sent against the insurgents,\r\ncommanded by the Caciques Parvina and Bermudez,[227] in the province\r\nof Cotabambas, who were both killed in a desperate action. Tupac Amaru\r\nused to call these brave chiefs his right and left arms. Meanwhile the\r\nmain body of the royalist army advanced slowly along the mountains to\r\nthe westward of the valley of the Vilcamayu, suffering much from the\r\nsnow-storms, the want of food and fuel, and the shameful neglect of\r\nall commissariat arrangements by Areche. On the 18th the Inca sent\r\na message to the Spanish General, saying that the morrow, being the\r\nfestival of San José, would be an appropriate day for settling their\r\ndifferences; and that he should prepare his troops for a movement of\r\nwhich, in compliment to the name-day of both himself and Del Valle, he\r\ndeemed it courteous to apprise his adversary. In consequence of this\r\nmessage the Spaniard kept his men under arms all night, but no attack\r\ntook place, and in the morning the Inca's army was found to be gone.\r\nTupac had intended a stratagem, and had retired into an unfrequented\r\nravine: on the 21st a snow-storm favoured his design, and his plan\r\nwould have succeeded, had not a traitor, named Zunuario de Castro,\r\ngiven Valle notice of his movements. The Spaniards changed their\r\nposition, and the Inca passed the night in vainly searching for it.\r\n\r\nGeneral del Valle was upwards of seventy years of age, and, unable\r\nlonger to endure the excessive cold of the mountains, he descended\r\ninto the valley of the Vilcamayu, and captured Quiquijana, hanging\r\nthe Cacique Luis Poma Inca, who defended it. On the 6th of April\r\nthe Spanish army advanced up the valley, meeting with considerable\r\nopposition, and reached Checacupe early in the day. Near this village\r\nthe Inca had taken up a position, defended by a ditch and parapet\r\nstretching across the valley, and manned by 20,000 men, but he had\r\nneglected to provide any defence for his flanks. A Spanish division\r\nstole unperceived to the back of the position, while the main body\r\nassaulted it in front; and after an heroic defence the Indians,\r\nattacked both in front and rear, fell back to another entrenched\r\nposition at Combapata, a league from Tinta, where the village was\r\nsurrounded by a mud wall, covered at the top with thorny bushes. The\r\nSpaniards, following up their success, played upon the village with\r\ntheir field-pieces for several hours, then carried the position at the\r\npoint of the bayonet, and made a bloody entry into Tinta.\r\n\r\nTupac Amaru, with his wife and three sons, fled to Lanqui, a village\r\nabout twenty miles to the westward, on the shores of a wild Alpine\r\nlake. Here he intended to have rallied his disordered troops, but he\r\nwas betrayed by one of his own officers, named Ventura Landaeta, who,\r\nassisted by the cura of the place, basely delivered the illustrious\r\nInca and his family into the hands of the Spaniards. On the same day\r\nGeneral del Valle hung sixty-seven Indian prisoners at Tinta, whose\r\nheads he stuck on poles by the road-side.[228] Diego Tupac Amaru, his\r\nnephew Andres Mendagure, and Mariano, the second son of the Inca,\r\nfortunately escaped.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of April Francisco, the aged uncle of the Inca,[229] was\r\nalso seized, and the prisoners were marched bareheaded into Cuzco, the\r\nvisitador Areche coming out as far as Urcos to meet them. They were\r\nall separated from each other, and told that they would not meet again\r\nuntil the day of execution.\r\n\r\nThe chief prisoners were the Inca Tupac Amaru, his wife, his two sons\r\nHipolito and Fernando, his uncle Francisco, his brother-in-law Antonio\r\nBastidas, his maternal cousin Patricio Noguera, his cousin Cecilia\r\nTupac Amaru with her husband Pedro Mendagure, a number of captains in\r\nthe Inca's army and other officials, and Aliaga's executioner named\r\nAntonio Oblitas,[230] a negro slave.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to record the diabolical cruelties of the visitador\r\nAreche, and his assistant Matta Linares, in order to complete the\r\nnarrative of the ill-fated Inca's life, and to show into whose hands\r\nthe fate of the Peruvian Indians was placed by the Spanish viceroy,\r\nand of what devilish atrocities they were capable. On the 15th of May,\r\n1781, the visitador Areche pronounced a lengthy sentence, in which he\r\ndeclared that it was necessary to hasten its execution, in order to\r\nconvince the Indians that it was not impossible to put a man of such\r\nelevated rank to death, merely because he was the heir of the Incas\r\nof Peru. He then accused the Inca of rebellion, of destroying the\r\n_obrajes_, of abolishing the _mita_, and of causing pictures to be\r\npainted of himself dressed in the imperial insignia of the _uncu_ or\r\nmantle, and _mascapaicha_ or head-dress; and others representing the\r\ntriumph of his arms at Sangarara. He condemned his victim to behold\r\nthe execution of his wife, his son, his uncle, his brother-in-law\r\nAntonio Bastidas, and of his captains; to have his tongue cut out,\r\nand afterwards to have his limbs secured to the girths of four horses\r\ndragging different ways, and thus to be torn in pieces. His body to\r\nbe burnt on the heights of Picchu, his head to be stuck on a pole\r\nat Tinta, one arm at Tungasuca, the other in Caravaya, a leg in\r\nChumbivilicas, and another in Lampa. His houses to be demolished,\r\ntheir sites strewn with salt, all his goods to be confiscated, all his\r\nrelations declared infamous, all documents relating to his descent to\r\nbe burnt by the hangman, all dresses used by the Incas or caciques\r\nto be prohibited, all pictures of the Incas to be seized and burnt,\r\nthe representation of Quichua dramas to be forbidden, all the musical\r\ninstruments of the Indians to be destroyed, all signs of mourning\r\nfor the Incas to be forbidden, all Indians to give up their national\r\ncostumes, and dress henceforth in the Spanish fashion, and the use of\r\nthe Quichua language to be prohibited.\r\n\r\nIn the annals of barbarism there is probably not to be found a document\r\nequalling this in savage wickedness and imbecile absurdity: and this\r\nwas written by a Spanish judge only eighty years ago.[231]\r\n\r\nThis hideous cruelty was literally carried into effect, in all its\r\nrevolting details. On Friday the 18th of May, 1781, after the great\r\nsquare had been surrounded by Spanish and negro troops, ten persons\r\ncame forth from the church of the Jesuits. One of these was the Inca\r\nTupac Amaru, who had, in the early morning, been visited in prison by\r\nAreche, and urged to betray all the accomplices in his rebellion.[232]\r\n\"You and I,\" he replied, \"are the only conspirators: you for having\r\noppressed the country with exactions which were unendurable, and I for\r\nhaving wished to free the people from such tyranny.\"[233] The Inca's\r\ncompanions in misfortune were his wife Micaela, his sons Hipolito and\r\nFernando, his brother-in-law Antonio Bastidas, his uncle Francisco\r\nTupac Amaru, Tomasa Condemaita the Cacica of Acos, José Verdejo and\r\nAndres Castelo, captains in the Inca's army, and the executioner\r\nOblitas.\r\n\r\nVerdejo, Castelo, Oblitas, and Bastidas were hung at once. The rest\r\nwere heavily chained, tied up in the bags which are used for carrying\r\nthe maté or Paraguay tea, and dragged backwards into the centre of the\r\nsquare by horses. Francisco and Hipolito Tupac Amaru, the one an old\r\nman verging on fourscore years, the other a youth of twenty, then had\r\ntheir tongues cut out, and, with Tomasa Condemaita, were garrotted by\r\nan iron screw, the first that had been seen in Cuzco. Micaela, the\r\nwife of the Inca, was then placed on the same scaffold, her tongue was\r\ncut out, and the screw was placed round her neck in presence of her\r\nhusband; but she suffered cruelly, because her neck was so small that\r\nthe screw failed to strangle her. The executioners then placed a lasso\r\nround her neck, and pulled different ways, at the same time kicking her\r\nin the stomach and bosom until they succeeded in killing her. The Inca\r\nwas then taken into the centre of the square, his chains were taken\r\noff, and his tongue was cut out. He was then thrown on the ground;\r\nlassos, secured to the girths of four horses, were fastened to his\r\nwrists and ankles, and the horses were made to drag different ways, \"a\r\nspectacle never before seen at Cuzco.\" As the unfortunate Inca's body\r\nwas thus raised into the air, his youngest son Fernando, a child of ten\r\nyears, who had been forced to witness this horrible massacre of his\r\nrelations, uttered a heartrending shriek, the knell of which continued\r\nto ring in the ears of those who heard it to their dying day.[234] The\r\nhorses did not pull at the same time, and the body remained suspended\r\nlike a spider for many minutes, until at last the brutal miscreant\r\nAreche, who was looking on from a window in the College of the Jesuits,\r\ncaused the head to be cut off.[235] The child Fernando was then passed\r\nunder the scaffold, and sentenced to be banished for life to one of the\r\npenal settlements in Africa.\r\n\r\nMany of the Spanish citizens were present, but not an Indian was to be\r\nseen. They afterwards declared that, while the horses were torturing\r\nthe Inca, a great wind arose, with torrents of rain, and that even\r\nthe elements felt the death of the Inca, whom the inhuman and impious\r\nSpaniards were torturing with such cruelty.[236]\r\n\r\nThe heads, bodies, and limbs of the victims were sent to the different\r\ntowns of Peru, and to the villages round Cuzco,[237] in order to\r\nstrike terror into the hearts of the Indians; but this proceeding of\r\ncourse had the opposite effect, and goaded them to fury. By the humane\r\nexertions of the Inca the war had hitherto been carried on without\r\nunnecessary bloodshed, and he had always protected unarmed persons and\r\nwomen; but, after the perpetration of these barbarities in Cuzco, it\r\nbecame a war of extermination, and during the following year not less\r\nthan 80,000 people fell victims to the vengeance of the Indian and\r\nSpanish troops.\r\n\r\nIn the revolting cruelty of Areche may be traced the abject terror of\r\na dastardly and craven mind; and to this cowardice may also be imputed\r\nthe concessions which were afterwards wrung from him.[238] Tupac Amaru\r\ndid not die in vain; for, after the suppression of his revolt, the\r\n_repartos_ were abolished, and the _mitas_ were much modified.\r\n\r\nThus fell the last of the Incas. He was a man of whom his nation might\r\nwell be proud, and will bear comparison with the greatest monarchs\r\nof his race. Having enjoyed the best education which Spanish policy\r\nat that time permitted to the people of the colonies, he brought a\r\ncultivated mind, a clear understanding, untiring industry, and devoted\r\nzeal for the welfare of his countrymen to his important duties as a\r\nwealthy and influential cacique. When he afterwards undertook the\r\noffice of defender of the oppressed Indians he displayed an amount\r\nof patient perseverance, combined with great ability in the advocacy\r\nof their cause, which excited the admiration of the Bishop of Cuzco\r\nand others of the more enlightened Spaniards. Finally, after he had\r\nunwillingly become convinced that all remonstrance was useless, he,\r\nin his appeal to arms, combined promptitude of action with great\r\nmoderation in his demands; his edicts were remarkable for their good\r\nsense and humanity; and had his efforts been met by the Spaniards in\r\na corresponding spirit, the viceroy of the King of Castille might at\r\nlength have succeeded in enforcing the practical observance of the\r\nhumane laws of his master.\r\n\r\nBut this was not to be. Instead of a calm and enlightened statesman,\r\nand Spain had many such, the viceroy placed full powers in the hands of\r\na wretch whose conduct was a mixture of cowardice, atrocious cruelty,\r\nand incapacity. Fortune decided in favour of the Spaniards, and the\r\nInca fell into the power of a man whose vile nature was excited to\r\nacts of unequalled barbarity by the terror which his position and his\r\nincompetence had caused him. I have felt obliged to relate the shocking\r\ncircumstances of the death of Tupac Amaru in justice to the Indians;\r\nfor who can be surprised if afterwards they frequently refused to give\r\nquarter to any of the hated race of _Chapetones_, as they called the\r\nSpaniards? and no atrocity was ever perpetrated by them which can be\r\ncompared to the execution of the Inca and his family, committed by the\r\ndeliberate sentence of a Spanish judge.[239]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nDIEGO TUPAC AMARU--FATE OF THE INCA'S FAMILY--INSURRECTION OF PUMACAGUA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHILE the events occurred in the valley of Vilcamayu which ended in the\r\ncapture of the Inca Tupac Amaru and his family, the whole of the Collao\r\nwas in a state of insurrection, and all Spaniards had to escape for\r\ntheir lives to Puno, La Paz, or Arequipa.\r\n\r\nDon Joaquim Antonio de Orellana,[240] Governor of Puno, made a\r\nmost gallant defence of that town, with a force consisting of 180\r\nmusketeers, 647 pikemen, 44 artillerymen with 4 guns, and 254 cavalry.\r\nHe retreated behind his entrenchments when the Inca advanced as far\r\nas Lampa, in December 1780; but in February 1781, in spite of the\r\nheavy rains, he marched to Lampa, where he flogged an Indian until\r\nhe confessed that his rebel countrymen were on an adjacent mountain\r\ncalled Catacora. Orellana found the rebel army drawn up in an almost\r\ninaccessible position, with colours flying; and, while seeking for a\r\nplace where his troops might ascend, they suffered from a storm of\r\nhail and snow. The Spaniards were divided into two assaulting parties,\r\nbut the showers of stones which the Indians hurled from their slings\r\nobliged them to retreat, and Orellana himself was wounded in the jaw.\r\n\r\nHe found it prudent to fall back towards Puno, and, on the 16th,\r\nencamped on the banks of the river of Juliaca, near a place called\r\nMananchili. The Indian army followed the Spaniards and offered them\r\nbattle--the chiefs sending a message to Orellana to tell him that they\r\nacknowledged no king but their Inca Tupac Amaru. They formed their\r\nforces in a semicircle--the right being led by the Cacique Andres\r\nIngaricona, the left by Mamani, and the centre by a chief of Caravaya\r\nnamed Alejandro Calisaya. The battle began at four P.M., and, after\r\na sharp fight, Mamani's division fled to the adjacent heights, and\r\nIngaricona was also routed. The Indians left 370 killed on the field;\r\namong whom there were many women who came to fight by the sides of\r\ntheir husbands and brothers, armed with bones sharpened at one end.\r\nNotwithstanding this success, Orellana made a rapid retreat to his\r\nentrenched position at Puno, collected provisions, and sent messengers\r\nto Arequipa for reinforcements.[241]\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of March the Indian army came in sight, extending for\r\nthree miles along the heights round Puno, with colours flying and a\r\ngreat noise of drums and clarions, entirely surrounding the town,\r\nexcept on the side of the lake. It was commanded by the Caciques Andres\r\nIngaricona and Pedro Vargas. The dismal news of the capture of Tupac\r\nAmaru reached the besieging Indians on April 12th, when they retreated,\r\nfollowed by a Spanish force under Nicolas de Mendiosala of Chucuito.\r\nHe overtook them posted on a hill called Condorcuyo, to the left of\r\nthe road to Cuzco, when a furious struggle commenced; but the Indians\r\nfought most gallantly, and defeated Mendiosala, who retreated in\r\ndisorder. This success encouraged the rebels as much as it disheartened\r\nthe Spaniards, and Chucuito and the other towns on the western\r\nbanks of the lake of Titicaca fell into their hands. They committed\r\nindiscriminate slaughter in revenge for the cruel death of the Inca,\r\nand only a few Spaniards escaped to Puno. The governor Orellana sent\r\nbalsas to rescue some fugitives who were concealed in the rushes on the\r\nshores of the lake, he himself being confined to his house[242] by a\r\nwound in his foot. Meanwhile the Indians of Azangaro, by capturing the\r\ntown and peninsula of Capachica, completed the conquest of the province\r\nof Chucuito, and the rebel chiefs prepared for a second siege of Puno.\r\n\r\nDiego Cristoval Tupac Amaru the Inca's cousin, with his nephew Andres\r\nMendagure, Mariano the young son of the Inca, and Miguel Bastidas a\r\nnephew of the Inca's wife, escaped when the rest of their family were\r\nbetrayed and captured at Lanqui. They now joined the rebel army in the\r\nCollao, Diego took the command, and on the 9th of May he invested Puno\r\non all sides, and commenced the second siege.\r\n\r\nThe Indians were formed in a semicircle on the sides of the surrounding\r\nhills; while Orellana had deepened his entrenchments, and occupied a\r\nvery strong position on the Huassa-pata hill, above Puno: he also built\r\ntwo forts, one called Santa Barbara, where the triumphal arch now is,\r\nand the other called Horca-pata, on the descent from the heights of\r\nCacharani. The corners of the plaza and of the streets were barricaded.\r\nOn the 10th there were skirmishes all day, and on the 11th the Indians\r\ncarried the forts of Santa Barbara and Horca-pata by assault, and\r\npenetrated into the streets, but failed in their attack on the rocky\r\nheight of the Huassa-pata.[243] On the 12th the besiegers suddenly\r\nretreated, at the approach of the army advancing from Cuzco.\r\n\r\nGeneral del Valle, after defeating the Indians at Combapata, continued\r\nhis march up the valley of the Vilcamayu, crossed the pass of Ayaviri,\r\nand, entering the Collao, advanced towards Puno, where he arrived in\r\nthe middle of May. But the Indians of his army were disgusted at the\r\nexcessive rigour with which the rebels were treated; they deserted in\r\ngreat numbers,[244] and assisted the troops of Diego Tupac Amaru in\r\nharassing the Spaniards, and cutting of all supplies. The army of del\r\nValle had been shamefully neglected by the visitador Areche, who was\r\ntoo busy in torturing his prisoners to attend to the commissariat.\r\nThe troops were wretchedly clad, unpaid, without medical stores,\r\nor biscuit, or fresh meat. Under these circumstances the General\r\nreluctantly determined to retreat to Cuzco, taking with him the\r\ngarrison and inhabitants of Puno, which place was evacuated by Orellana\r\non the 26th of May. The army which had left Cuzco in March 15,000\r\nstrong was now reduced, by desertions and sickness, to 1443 men, with\r\nwhich force General del Valle commenced the retreat, closely followed\r\nand constantly harassed by the Indians. He reached Cuzco on the 4th\r\nof July, when a paper war ensued between him and Areche, the latter\r\nblaming him for evacuating Puno, while the General retorted that Areche\r\nhad shamefully neglected the wants of his army, and failed to make any\r\nattempt to subdue the country round Cuzco.[245]\r\n\r\nThe Viceroy seems to have taken the part of the General in this\r\ncontroversy; and the foul vulture Areche, with his companion Matta\r\nLinares, was recalled. He reached Lima on August 23rd, 1781, and\r\nembarked for Spain with the poor little Fernando, son of Tupac Amaru,\r\nwho was sentenced to imprisonment for life.\r\n\r\nThe Indians still remained in arms round Cuzco, especially in the\r\nheights above Urubamba and Calca, and at Lauramarca and Ocungate. Those\r\nnear Calca fortified themselves in a place called Chayña-ccasa, against\r\nwhom the General sent a force of 400 men under Don José de Barela,\r\nand the Indians were defeated with great slaughter; while Don Joaquim\r\nBalcarcel kept the insurgents in check, who continued to threaten\r\nPaucartambo.\r\n\r\nAfter the retreat of General del Valle from Puno, Diego Tupac Amaru\r\nestablished his head-quarters at the town of Azangaro, while Andres\r\nMendagure and Miguel Bastidas overran the provinces on the eastern\r\nshore of lake Titicaca, captured the town of Sorata, and placed\r\nthemselves in communication with the insurgent forces in Upper Peru.\r\nIt is said that fifteen mule-loads of treasure, consisting of spoils\r\nfrom the provinces of Omasuyos and Larecaja, were brought into Azangaro\r\nat this time and buried. Diego Tupac Amaru occupied a house near\r\nthe plaza, where he gave audience in a long sala; and he went from\r\nthis house to the church every night, wrapped in a large cloak. This\r\nstory made people believe that he was concealing treasure, and many a\r\nfruitless search has since been made for it.[246]\r\n\r\nThe hopes of the Indians were now beginning to wane. Diego, though a\r\nman of considerable talent, was not possessed of the same influence\r\nover the people as his unfortunate cousin; and the Spanish officials\r\nwere rapidly receiving reinforcements from Buenos Ayres, while the\r\nslaughter of the Indians had been prodigious. In August, 1781, Diego\r\nissued a decree, ordering that all women, children, and priests,\r\nshould be respected during the war;[247] and on the 18th of October he\r\npromulgated a manifesto setting forth the numerous violations of law\r\nhabitually committed by the corregidors, the exactions of the curas,\r\nand the extortionate duties imposed by the aduaneros.[248] This is a\r\nvery able and telling document, and, together with the more detailed\r\nwritings of the unfortunate Inca, forms a most complete vindication of\r\nthis memorable insurrection.[249]\r\n\r\nOn September 12th, 1781, the viceroy of Peru, Don Augustin de Jauregui,\r\nhad issued a proclamation offering pardon, on submission, to Diego\r\nTupac Amaru and all his followers.[250] It would swell this short\r\nnarrative to an undue length if I attempted to give any account of the\r\nevents in Upper Peru during this period;[251] but the final suppression\r\nof the revolt in that part of the country by the Spanish commanders\r\nFlores, Reseguin, and Segurola, induced Diego Tupac Amaru to accept the\r\nViceroy's offer of pardon, give up the cause, and place himself in the\r\npower of a faithless enemy. Dr. Antonio Valdez, cura of Sicuani, the\r\nfriend of the Inca, and author of the Quichua play of 'Ollantay,' was\r\nsent to Azangaro by the Spanish authorities to persuade Diego to adopt\r\nthis course. They held their conferences on the subject while walking\r\nup and down on the banks of the river; and there is a tradition that\r\nPedro Vilca Apasa, one of Diego's bravest officers, overheard one of\r\nthese conversations, and remonstrated violently against the madness of\r\ntrusting to the word of a Spaniard. But the advice of Valdez prevailed,\r\nDiego sent young Miguel Bastidas to open a negotiation with the Spanish\r\nColonel Reseguin in November; and on December 11th he gave himself up\r\nto Don Ramon de Arias, commandant of the column of Arequipa. At the\r\nsame time Mariano Tupac Amaru, the son of the Inca, Andres Mendagure,\r\nand Miguel Bastidas, surrendered to Don Sebastian de Segurola at La\r\nPaz. Bastidas was sent to Buenos Ayres.\r\n\r\nDiego Tupac Amaru received his pardon at Sicuani, from General del\r\nValle in the name of the viceroy, on January 26th, 1782; and on the\r\nsame day the Bishop of Cuzco[252] solemnly absolved him in the church.\r\nBut Vilca Apasa, Alejandro Calisaya, and other chiefs of Diego's army,\r\nrefused to submit, and continued in arms in the provinces of Caravaya\r\nand Azangaro. General del Valle marched against them in March 1782, and\r\ntook most of them prisoners. Vilca Apasa was captured in his native\r\nvillage of Tapa-tapa, eighteen miles east of Azangaro, where his\r\ndescendants still live. He was torn to pieces by horses in the plaza of\r\nAzangaro, and his limbs were stuck on poles by the road-side.[253] An\r\nold lady told me that she could remember seeing one of his arms on a\r\npole near her father's house. Calisaya, and many others, were hung. The\r\nSpanish General had the cruelty to force Diego Tupac Amaru to accompany\r\nhim, and to witness the execution of his old friends. Del Valle then\r\nmarched over the cordilleras of Lauramarca and Ausangate, where the\r\nIndians had been in rebellion, taking Diego with him in a sort of\r\ntriumph, and returned to Cuzco in August. The old general was taken ill\r\nsoon afterwards, and died at Cuzco on the 4th of September, leaving the\r\ncommand of the troops to Don Gabriel de Aviles.\r\n\r\nDiego Tupac Amaru was permitted to retire to Tungasuca; and young\r\nMariano Tupac Amaru, with his cousin Andres Mendegure, lived at\r\nSicuani. But it would appear that the Spanish authorities had no\r\nintention of keeping their faith with these unfortunate Indians, and\r\nit was soon seen that the distrust of Vilca Apasa was but too well\r\nfounded. The Spaniards were only waiting for an excuse before they\r\ncompleted the extirpation of the whole family of the Incas. This was\r\nsoon found in a rebellion of the Indians of Marcapata and Lauramarca,\r\nwho, on the approach of a force under the Corregidor Necochea in\r\nJanuary 1783, retired to the lofty and almost impenetrable heights\r\nof Hapo and Ampatuni. In February their leader, Santos Huayhua, was\r\ncaptured with his family, and torn to pieces by horses.[254]\r\n\r\nThus the desired excuse for treachery and faithlessness was furnished.\r\nAll the surviving members of the family of the Inca Tupac Amaru were\r\narrested, by order of the viceroy of Peru.[255] The accusations against\r\nthem were frivolous, and, so far as appears in the sentences, without\r\na shadow of proof to support them. Diego was accused of calling the\r\nIndians his sons, of living in a way unbefitting a pardoned rebel, and\r\nof performing funeral rites for his cousin the Inca; young Mariano\r\nTupac Amaru of rescuing his lady-love on September 9th, who had been\r\nforced to become a novice in the monastery of Santa Catalina in Cuzco;\r\nAndres Mendagure of conducting himself in a suspicious way; Manuela\r\nCastro, the mother of Diego, of keeping up disaffection amongst the\r\nIndians; and Lorenzo and Simon Condori, the brothers-in-law of Diego,\r\nof assisting the rebels in Marcapata. The rest of the family were\r\naccused of being relations.\r\n\r\nDiego was imprisoned with his kindred on the 15th of April, 1783,\r\nby Don Raymundo Necochea, Corregidor of Quispicanchi;[256] while\r\nMariano Tupac Amaru and Andres Mendagure were sent to Lima, put on\r\nboard a ship, butchered at sea, and their bodies thrown overboard.\r\nThe vulture Matta Linares, who was still an Oidor of the Audienica at\r\nLima, scented carrion from afar, and arrived at Cuzco on April 20th,\r\nwith the same extraordinary judicial powers as had previously been\r\ngiven by the viceroy to Areche. On the 17th of July he sentenced Diego\r\nTupac Amaru to be dragged at the tail of a mule, with a rope round his\r\nneck, to the place of execution in the plaza of Cuzco, there to be\r\nhung and quartered, his body and limbs to be distributed amongst the\r\ntowns of Tungasuca, Lauramarca, Paucartambo, and Calca, his goods to be\r\nconfiscated, and his houses destroyed; his mother, Marcela Castro, to\r\nbe hung and quartered, and her body to be burnt in the plaza; Lorenzo\r\nand Simon Condori to be hung; and Manuela Titu Condori, the wife of\r\nDiego, to be banished for life.[257] These sentences were executed\r\non the 19th of July 1783; and Matta Linares obliged the good cura of\r\nSicuani, Dr. Valdez, by whose persuasion, as the ancient friend of the\r\nInca Tupac Amaru, Diego had been induced to accept the treacherous\r\npardon, to witness the executions.[258] Matta Linares is still\r\nremembered in Cuzco for his barbarous, immoral, and sneaking conduct.\r\nHe died in Spain in about 1818, having been one of the first among the\r\nunworthy Spaniards who declared in favour of Joseph Buonaparte.\r\n\r\nAt about the time of Diego's execution, the last spark of insurrection\r\nwas trampled out in Huarochiri, a province in the Andes near Lima.\r\nThe Indians of the villages near Caramporna had risen under one Felipe\r\nVelasco Tupac Inca Yupanqui, who declared that the Inca was not dead,\r\nbut that he was alive and crowned in the \"Gran Paytiti.\"[259] Don\r\nFelipe Carrera, who had been appointed Corregidor of Parinacochas, was\r\nsent to Huarochiri, and by a rapid march succeeded in capturing the\r\nchief. Towards evening, however, he was surrounded by a large body of\r\nIndians armed with slings and poles, in a narrow and dangerous part\r\nof the road. He retreated to an eminence with his prisoner, where he\r\ndefended himself until dark against the storm of stones, and then\r\nescaped to Lima. After daily fights with the Indians the rebellion was\r\nput down in June, 1783. Felipe Velasco, and his lieutenant Ciriaco\r\nFlores, were hung in the great square of Lima on July 7th, 1783.[260]\r\n\r\nHaving, after two years and a half, succeeded in quelling the\r\ninsurrection, it remained for the viceroy to extirpate all the\r\ninnocent members of the family of the Incas, and all who were\r\nconnected with them by marriage. Ninety members of the family were\r\nsent to Lima in chains, among whom were Bartolomé Tupac Amaru, the\r\nvenerable great-uncle of the Inca; Marcela Pallocahua, the mother of\r\nthe Inca's wife Micaela Bastidas; and Manuela Condori, the wife of\r\nDiego. Soon after his arrival at Lima Bartolomé Tupac Amaru died at\r\nthe extraordinary age of 125. A life of temperance had given this aged\r\nprince the strength to endure months of solitary confinement at Cuzco,\r\nto sustain blows from muskets and staves in the plaza, to undergo a\r\ncruel journey on foot and in chains of 400 miles, but the horrors of\r\nthe Lima prison at length killed him. The unhappy survivors were\r\nshipped off at Callao, in two ships, the 'Peruana' and the 'San Pedro,'\r\nand thrown into cells in Cadiz for three years, when Charles III.\r\ncaused them to be distributed, apart from each other, in prisons in\r\nthe interior of Spain, until their sufferings were relieved by death.\r\nOnce during the voyage they were allowed by the brutal captain of the\r\ntransport 'Peruana,' named José Cordova, to wash their tattered clothes\r\nat Rio; but their fetters were never removed, and, though the captain\r\ngave his word of honour to a Frenchman who mended his damaged rudder,\r\nthat he would take them off, he unblushingly perjured himself; and the\r\nhorrors which were suffered by these innocent persons, many of them\r\naged women and young children, were never relaxed until they arrived at\r\nCadiz.[261]\r\n\r\nFernando, the youngest child of the Inca, \"whose shrill cry smote every\r\nheart with electric sympathy\"[262] when he beheld the cruel tortures\r\nof his parents, was taken to Spain by the visitador Areche in 1781.\r\nHe was then only ten years of age. In 1783 one Don Luis Ocampo, a\r\ncitizen of Cuzco, went to Spain, and heard that young Fernando was a\r\nclose prisoner in the castle of San Sebastian at Cadiz. Through the\r\naid of an Irish gentleman, who was intimately acquainted with the\r\ntown major, Ocampo applied for a pass to visit him, but was refused.\r\nHe, nevertheless, made his way into the fort, and, looking round at\r\nthe iron gratings of the cells, at length caught sight of a youth\r\nwhose countenance bespoke his origin. He addressed him in Quichua,\r\nand found that he was speaking to Fernando Tupac Amaru. While talking\r\nto him Ocampo received a blow from the butt end of the musket of a\r\nSwiss sentry, whom, however, he induced to permit him to continue the\r\nconversation. It appeared that the government allowed Fernando six\r\nrials a day, but that the soldiers of the guard cheated him of half.\r\nOcampo gave him two or three dollars a week during his stay in Cadiz;\r\nand this is the last we know, for a certainty, of the last surviving\r\nchild of the unfortunate Inca.[263]\r\n\r\nThe fate of these poor Indians, the remaining descendants of those\r\nIncas of Peru whose remarkable civilization, and great power and\r\nwealth, became a proverb during the sixteenth century, will not\r\nfail to be interesting to those who have become acquainted, through\r\nthe pages of Robertson, Prescott, or Helps, with the history of the\r\nSpanish conquest of Peru. The sufferings and death of Tupac Amaru and\r\nhis family form a very sad story, yet they did not suffer and die in\r\nvain: and it must be recorded of them that, unlike other dispossessed\r\nfamilies, they sacrificed themselves, not for their own selfish ends,\r\nbut in the hope of serving their people. They did not die in vain,\r\nfor in their fall they shook the colonial power of Spain to its\r\nfoundation. Not only was the system of _repartos_ at once abolished,\r\nand the _mitas_ considerably modified, but in 1795 the hated office of\r\ncorregidors was replaced by that of intendentes, and from the cruel\r\ndeath of the last of the Incas may be dated the rise of that feeling\r\nwhich ended in the expulsion of the Spaniards from Peru.\r\n\r\nThe rebellion which broke out in Cuzco, thirty-four years after the\r\ndeath of Tupac Amaru, is historically important, not on account of\r\nthe patriotism of its leaders, for they were almost all men of small\r\nweight and selfish ends, but because the great body of the Indians rose\r\nas one man at the first signal, in the hope of freeing their country\r\nfrom a foreign yoke. In 1809 the people of Upper Peru had formed an\r\nindependent government, which they called an \"Institucion de Gobierno,\"\r\nand the viceroy sent General Goyeneche against them with 5000 men from\r\nCuzco. The rebels, ill-provided with arms, were defeated at Huaqui,\r\nnear lake Titicaca, and slaughtered without mercy;[264] but General\r\nPezuela, who succeeded Goyeneche in the command, had to face a patriot\r\narmy from Buenos Ayres under Belgrano, which kept him fully employed.\r\nThen it was that the opportunity was seized of commencing a rebellion\r\nat Cuzco; and this enemy in the rear of the royal army placed Pezuela\r\nin a most critical position.\r\n\r\nThe leader of the rebellion was Mateo Garcia Pumacagua, Cacique of\r\nChinchero near Cuzco, then a very old men. In January 1781, when Tupac\r\nAmaru occupied the heights of Picchu above Cuzco, he had marched from\r\nChinchero with Indians to join him, but, hearing that a large Spanish\r\narmy was advancing from Lima, he changed his mind, and took part\r\nagainst his countrymen with such zeal, that the viceroy created him\r\na brigadier in the Spanish service. On August 3rd, 1814, this Indian\r\nCacique Pumacagua, with the three brothers Vicente, Mariano, and José\r\nAngulo, Don Gabriel Bejar, Hurtado de Mendoza, Astete, Pinelo, Prado,\r\nand others, raised the cry of independence in Cuzco; and so unanimous\r\nwas the feeling against Spanish rule, that the whole population of\r\nthat city joined heart and soul in the insurrection.[265] The brothers\r\nAngulo were men of low birth, and vulgar both in their language and\r\ntheir persons;[266] but Astete and Prado were gentlemen of good family\r\nand position. It is possible that they made use of Pumacagua, as an\r\nIndian cacique, that his countrymen might more readily be induced to\r\njoin their cause.\r\n\r\nHaving occupied Cuzco, the insurgents divided their forces into three\r\ndivisions, which separated in different directions, to excite the\r\nother provinces to revolt. Mariano Angulo, Bejar, and Mendoza, who\r\nwas nicknamed Santafecino, marched to Guamanga, assaulted the house\r\nin which several Spaniards had taken refuge, and hung two officers\r\nin the plaza. Colonel Vicente Gonzalez was sent against them from\r\nLima, and attacked the insurgents, who had been joined by a body of\r\nMorochuco Indians, near Guanta, in September. The rebels were defeated,\r\nand several Morochuco Indians were shot at Guamanga, but the country\r\ncontinued in a disordered state until Santafecino was finally routed at\r\nMatara in April 1815.\r\n\r\nPinelo, and the cura of Munecas in Upper Peru, entered Puno without\r\nresistance with another division on August 29th, advanced to La Paz,\r\nand took it by assault after a siege of two days, on September 24th.\r\n\r\nThe main division, led by Pumacagua in person, and Vicente Angulo,\r\nmarched on Arequipa.\r\n\r\nThe position of the royalist army under Pezuela, with the Buenos Ayrean\r\narmy of independence in front, and this formidable insurrection in the\r\nrear, was most critical: for the Indians, believing that the rule of\r\ntheir Incas was to be restored, and that Pumacagua would succeed where\r\nTupac Amaru had failed, were flocking in thousands to the standard of\r\nthe old cacique. Pezuela organized a division of his army, 1200 strong,\r\ncommanded by General Don Juan Ramirez, who marched from Oruro in\r\nOctober, and fell upon the rebels, numbering 4000 men, 500 armed with\r\nmuskets, and the rest with slings, who were encamped on the heights\r\nabove La Paz. The rebels retired in good order to Puno, and Ramirez\r\nentered La Paz, and, having extorted 63,000 dollars from the citizens,\r\ncontinued his march to Puno, which he occupied on November 23rd, and\r\npressed on towards Arequipa on the 26th.[267]\r\n\r\nIn the mean while Pumacagua and Angulo had been joined by many caciques\r\nwith their _ayllus_ or tribes, and he organized his army at Cavanilla,\r\ngiving the rank of generals and colonels to the Indian chiefs.[268]\r\nFrom Cavanilla the rebel forces marched along the road from Puno to\r\nArequipa, descended the \"alto de los huesos,\" and encountered the\r\nSpanish troops under Brigadier Picoaga in the plain of Cangallo.\r\nPicoaga was defeated and taken prisoner, and the Indians entered\r\nArequipa in triumph, where the greatest enthusiasm prevailed for the\r\ncause of independence. Picoaga and Moscoso, the Intendente of Arequipa,\r\nwere shot by order of the Angulos, who, early in December, issued a\r\nproclamation, declaring that Peru was free; that there had been a\r\nrevolution in Lima; and that the viceroy Don José de Abascal was in\r\nprison. These falsehoods were intended to excite the Spanish Americans\r\nto revolt; but, indeed, they required no such stimulus, for the people\r\nof all races and classes were burning to throw off the yoke of Spain.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that Melgar, the enthusiastic young poet of\r\nArequipa, joined the national army, and became secretary to Vicente\r\nAngulo.\r\n\r\nOn the approach of Ramirez, Pumacagua evacuated Arequipa, and manœuvred\r\nfor some days on the lofty plains between Apo and the post-house of\r\nPati. Ramirez steadily advanced, and came in sight of the Indian army\r\nat a little hut called Chillihua, near the head of the \"alto de los\r\nhuesos;\" but Pumacagua, avoiding a battle, retreated hastily into the\r\ninterior, and Ramirez entered Arequipa without opposition on December\r\n9th. His first act was to shoot Don José Astete, and other patriots who\r\nhad compromised themselves during the time that Pumacagua was in the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm of the Indians was so great that, notwithstanding the\r\naffair at Chillihua, which one authority describes as a retreat,[269]\r\nand another as a disastrous defeat,[270] they again flocked to the\r\nstandard of the old cacique at Pucara, where he soon had another\r\nundisciplined half-armed force around him, numbering 40,000 men.\r\nRamirez organized a force at Arequipa of 1200 men armed with muskets,\r\nand fifty dragoons; and, commencing his march on February 11th, 1815,\r\nhe encamped round the town of Lampa on March 1st. On that day he\r\nreceived a letter from Vicente Angulo, protesting against the war\r\nbeing carried on in a savage and relentless spirit, representing that,\r\nwhen a whole people rises in arms, the insurgents ought to be granted\r\nbelligerent rights; and urging the duty of concluding the war by\r\nnegotiation, and not by bloodshed. \"It is not fear,\" Angulo continues,\r\n\"that induces me to write thus, but a feeling of humanity.\"[271]\r\nRamirez answered that he would accept nothing but unconditional\r\nsurrender. On March 4th he advanced to Ayaviri, on the Vilcañota range,\r\nwhich separates the Collao from the valley of the Vilcamayu. Here\r\nhe received a letter from Pumacagua. The cacique asked the Spanish\r\ngeneral for whom he was fighting, seeing that Ferdinand VII. had been\r\nsold to the French, and that no man knew where he had been taken to; he\r\ndeclared that there was now no other king but the caprice of Europeans,\r\nand that, therefore, he desired to establish a national Government; and\r\nhe told him that he was ready to meet the Spanish army on the field of\r\nbattle.[272] Ramirez replied that a general of the king's army would\r\nnot waste words with vile and insolent rebels, and that his bayonets\r\nwould soon make them alter their tone.[273]\r\n\r\nFrom the 6th to the 10th of March both armies marched in parallel\r\nlines, separated by the rivers Umachiri and Ayaviri. On the 10th\r\nPumacagua drew up his army behind the river Cupi, which was much\r\nswollen by the rains. He had 30,000 men, of whom 800 only were armed\r\nwith muskets, and forty field-pieces, said to have been cast at Cuzco\r\nby an Englishman named George ----,[274] some of them of very large\r\ncalibre, with which he annoyed the Spaniards during the night before\r\nthe battle. Ramirez had only 1300 men; but they were all disciplined\r\nand well-armed soldiers. He crossed the river Cupi, near Umachiri,\r\nin spite of opposition; charged and dispersed the Indians, killing a\r\nthousand men, and captured all their cannon. The rout was complete, and\r\nthe chiefs of the patriot army sought safety in flight.[275]\r\n\r\nThe poet Mariano Melgar was taken prisoner, and immediately shot on\r\nthe field of battle. The fate of this young man was very melancholy:\r\nan unrequited passion led him to join the desperate cause of the\r\ninsurgents, and he is now chiefly remembered by his melancholy\r\nlove-songs and _despedidas_.[276]\r\n\r\nRamirez, immediately after the battle of Umachiri, marched to Cuzco,\r\nwhere he arrived on the 25th; but he detached a portion of his troops\r\nin pursuit of the Indians, who were again defeated close to the town\r\nof Azangaro. The Spaniards cut off the ears of all their prisoners,\r\nflogged them cruelly, and sent them to tell their comrades that they\r\nwould be treated in the same way unless they instantly laid down their\r\narms. The Indians fled over the hills, followed by the Spaniards, who\r\nagain defeated them on a hill near Asillo, six leagues to the north.\r\nAmongst the prisoners at Asillo were the mutilated Indians who had been\r\nsent to terrify the rest, still bravely fighting against their tyrants.\r\nOf such heroism is the usually meek and docile Indian capable.[277]\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Umachiri, Pumacagua had escaped to the heights of\r\nMarangani; but he was betrayed by an Indian whom he had sent down to\r\nbuy some food, and brought a prisoner into Sicuani. After a sort of\r\nconfession had been extorted from him, he was hung, not even with a\r\nrespectable halter, but with a lasso, being seventy-seven years of age.\r\nJosé, Mariano, and Vicente Angulo, Gabriel Bejar, and many others were\r\nshot at Cuzco by Ramirez, who, in the following June, again united his\r\nforces with those of General Pezuela, in Upper Peru. Thus ended the\r\nlast great rising of the Indians under one of their own chiefs, after a\r\ncampaign which lasted ten months.\r\n\r\nTen years after the death of Pumacagua every Spanish soldier had\r\nbeen driven out of the country. Peru was independent, and the Indians\r\nreceived equal rights with citizens of Spanish descent in the new\r\nRepublic, at least so far, and only so far, as the law could give them.\r\nThe _mita_ or forced labour was entirely abolished in 1825; but the\r\ntribute or capitation-tax continued to be exacted until 1854 in Peru,\r\nand is still the principal source of revenue in Bolivia, the Upper\r\nPeru of Spanish times. It is not, however, quite exact to suppose that\r\nthis tribute was a capitation-tax; it was practically at least a rent\r\nor tax on the produce of the land, and more resembled the land-tax\r\nof India. The tribute was levied on every male between the ages of\r\neighteen and fifty; but, in point of fact, nearly every individual\r\nbetween those ages cultivated his own piece of land, or shared the\r\nproduce of a larger piece with several others. Latterly the tribute\r\npaid by each Indian generally amounted to five dollars a year; but,\r\nin some villages, the Indians paid double that amount, the exact rule\r\nbeing handed down by tradition, and known to the caciques. Those who\r\npaid most enjoyed a more dignified position. The department of Puno\r\nyielded 300,000 dollars; that of Cuzco, 400,000. The entire abolition\r\nof the tribute by General Castilla in 1854 is a portion of that mad\r\nand reckless system of finance by which the revenue of Peru is made\r\nto depend almost exclusively on the yield of guano from the Chincha\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\nIn Bolivia the tribute is still paid by men between the ages of\r\neighteen and fifty: the amount being six to ten dollars a year for\r\nproprietors of land, and five dollars for strangers. The revenue from\r\nthis source amounted, in 1850, to 4,595,000 dollars.\r\n\r\nBut though the _mita_, the _reparto_, and the tribute have all been\r\nabolished by law in Peru, the deplorable civil wars, and the system of\r\nkeeping up a large standing army, which is not only unnecessary, but\r\nmost mischievous, have entailed much oppression on the Indians in the\r\nshape of impressment for the army. Villages are frequently surrounded\r\nby a party of soldiers, and all the able-bodied men that can be caught\r\nare driven away to serve in the ranks. This deplorable waste of human\r\nlife is rapidly reducing the already scanty population; and the system\r\nis more oppressive and cruel because it is done in defiance of the\r\nlaw, by the military presidents and generals who have hitherto been\r\nable to set the laws enacted by civilians at defiance, when it suits\r\ntheir purpose.[278] Yet on the whole the condition of the Indians is\r\nimmeasurably more endurable under the Republic than it was when they\r\ngroaned under the _mitas_ of the Spanish corregidors.\r\n\r\nThe history of these Peruvian Indians has been a very melancholy one.\r\nThe early accounts which the Spanish chroniclers gave of the great\r\nempire of the Incas represented the Indians as a people ruled by laws\r\nand usages which provided for almost every action of their lives;\r\nneither a thief nor a vicious man was known amongst them; and they\r\nlived in happiness and contentment, but under a most rigid system of\r\ntutelage and subjection. Then came the Spanish conquerors, and, after\r\na quarter of a century of bloodshed and rapine, the people found\r\nthemselves bowed down by a grievous yoke. While the most beneficent\r\nlaws were enacted by the Council of the Indies, their humane provisions\r\ncontinued to be either entirely evaded, or converted into pretexts\r\nfor additional modes of oppression. From upwards of thirty millions\r\nthe population was reduced to three millions within the space of\r\ntwo centuries; and all that can be said of the much-lauded colonial\r\nlegislation of Spain is that it prevented the Indians from being\r\nactually exterminated; and that, when Peru gained her independence,\r\nthere were a few million survivors, scattered in villages at wide\r\nintervals over a region once thickly peopled by their ancestors. The\r\nCouncil-room at Seville was, like another place, thickly paved with\r\ngood intentions.\r\n\r\nI was thrown a great deal amongst the Indians, and at one time I had\r\nthe most excellent opportunities of judging of their character, and\r\nI was certainly most favourably impressed. They now have many vices\r\nengendered by centuries of oppression and evil example, from which\r\ntheir ancestors were probably free: they are fond of chicha and\r\naguardiente, and are very suspicious; but I found that this latter\r\nfeeling disappears when the occasion for it is found not to exist. They\r\nhave had but too good reason for their suspicion generally. On the\r\nother hand, they are intelligent, patient, obedient, loving amongst\r\neach other, and particularly kind to animals. Crimes of any magnitude\r\nare hardly ever heard of amongst them; and I am sure that there is\r\nno safer region in the world for the traveller, than the plateaux\r\nof the Peruvian cordilleras. That the Indians are not cowardly or\r\nmean-spirited when once roused was proved in the battles which they\r\nfought under the banner of Tupac Amaru in 1781; and a people who could\r\nproduce men capable of such heroic constancy as was displayed by the\r\nmutilated heroes of Asillo should not lightly be accused of want of\r\ncourage. When well led they make excellent soldiers.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is so large a proportion of _mestizos_, or half-castes,\r\nin Peru, it is very remarkable how isolated the Indians still remain.\r\nThey have their separate language, and traditions, and feelings, apart\r\nfrom their neighbours of Spanish origin; and it is even said that\r\nthere are secret modes of intercourse, and even secret designs amongst\r\nthem, the knowledge of which is guarded with jealous care. In 1841,\r\nwhen General Gamarra was at Pucara, on his way to invade Bolivia, it\r\nwas reported that certain influential Indians, from all parts of the\r\ncountry, were about to assemble in the hills near Azangaro, for the\r\ndiscussion of some grave business; and that they were in the habit\r\nof assembling in the same way, though in different localities, every\r\nfive years. The object of these assemblies was unknown--it may have\r\nbeen merely to converse over their ancient traditions--but it was\r\nfeared, at the time, that it was for some far deeper and more momentous\r\npurpose. It is believed that similar meetings have since taken place\r\nnear Chayanta[279] in Bolivia, near Quito, and in other parts, but the\r\nstrictest secrecy is preserved by the Indians themselves. The abolition\r\nof the tribute has probably had the effect of separating the Indians\r\nstill more from the white and mixed races, for they used to have\r\nconstant intercourse connected with the payments to the authorities,\r\nwhich brought them into the towns, while now they live apart in their\r\nsolitary huts in the mountain fastnesses, or in distant villages.\r\n\r\nIt may be that this unhappy people, descendants of the once mighty\r\nrace which, in the glorious days of the Incas, conquered and civilised\r\nhalf a continent, is marching slowly down the gloomy and dark road to\r\nextinction; \"the fading remains of a society sinking amidst storms,\r\noverthrown and shattered by overwhelming catastrophes.\"[280] But I\r\ntrust that this may not be so, and that a fate less sad is still\r\nreserved for the long-suffering gentle children of the Sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nJOURNEY FROM PUNO TO CRUCERO, THE CAPITAL OF CARAVAYA.\r\n\r\n\r\nON April 7th we left Puno on the road to the chinchona forests\r\nof Caravaya. There are three modes of travelling in Peru: one by\r\npurchasing all the required mules and employing servants; the second,\r\nby hiring an _arriero_, or muleteer, who supplies the mules at so much\r\nfor the journey; and the third, by using the wretched animals which\r\nare provided at the post-houses, and changing them at each stage, but\r\nthis can only be done on the main roads. The latter way, though the\r\nleast comfortable, is by far the most economical, and I therefore\r\ndetermined to adopt it, yet I should probably have hesitated had I\r\nknown the trouble it would entail. I bought a fine mule for a hundred\r\ndollars, with the gentle _paso llano_, the easiest pace imaginable, for\r\nmyself, and sent to the post-house at Puno for beasts for Mr. Weir, the\r\ngardener who accompanied me, and for the baggage. Four vicious-looking\r\nbrutes accordingly made their appearance, and we started; but no sooner\r\nhad we reached the plain at the top of the zigzag path leading out of\r\nPuno to the north, than they all ran away in different directions,\r\nkicking violently. After hours of this kind of annoyance I at last got\r\none of the brutes into a corner of a stone-fenced field, but, just\r\nas I was about to catch him, he gave a kick, jumped over the wall,\r\nand went off again. It ended in our having to drag the mules by their\r\nlassos until our arms were nearly torn out of the sockets; and thus we\r\nignominiously entered the village of Paucar-colla late in the evening,\r\na distance of only twelve miles from Puno. As for the scenery, or the\r\nnature of the country, between Puno and Paucar-colla, I can remember\r\nnothing but vicious mules with their hind legs kicking up in the air.\r\n\r\nPaucar-colla is built on an eminence, surrounded by broad grassy\r\nplains, which slope down to the shores of the lake of Titicaca. It\r\nconsists of a few streets of mud-built, red-tiled huts, ranged round\r\na large plaza, with a church in a dilapidated state, also of mud. At\r\nthis place I saw the last of the Aymara Indians, or at least of their\r\nwomen, who can always be distinguished by their dress, which differs\r\nfrom that worn by the Inca or Quichua Indians. The Aymara women wear\r\nan _uncu_, or garment brought together over each shoulder, and secured\r\nin the mode of the classic Greeks, with two _topus_, or large pins,\r\ngenerally in the shape of spoons. The head-dress is a curiously-shaped,\r\nfour-cornered red cap, the sides curving outwards and stiff, with black\r\nflaps suspended from it, sometimes hanging down, and at others thrown\r\nup over the top. The Quichua dress, used by the women from here as far\r\nas Cuzco, is quite different: they have a full woollen skirt, reaching\r\ndown half-way between the knee and ankle; a bright-coloured _lliclla_,\r\nor mantle, over the shoulders, secured across the bosom by a single\r\n_topu_; and as a head-dress the broad-brimmed black velvet _montero_,\r\nwith red and blue ribbons.\r\n\r\nI left Paucar-colla early next morning, and passed by several fields of\r\n_quinoa_ (Chenopodium quinoa), the harvest of which was just beginning.\r\nThe stalks are cut and tied up in heaps, and then the grain is beaten\r\nout with sticks. It is used by the Indians in their universal dish,\r\nthe _chupe_, and in various other ways; but it is an insipid and not\r\nvery nutritious grain. Just beyond the village there is a stream called\r\nthe Illpa, which, in the dry season, scarcely wets the mules' hoofs;\r\nbut at this time of year it was swollen into a broad river, and it\r\nwas necessary to cross it on reed balsas, with the luggage, while the\r\nmules swam. A very large troop of mules, laden with aguardiente, was\r\npassing over at the same time--a long and tedious business. There are\r\nmany streams crossing these roads, which are swollen during the rainy\r\nseason, and very serious delays are thus caused for want of a few\r\nbridges. From the Illpa to Caracoto there is a broad plain extending\r\nto the shores of the lake, with the town or village of Hatun-colla on\r\none of the last spurs of the cordillera to the west.[281] This wide\r\nexpanse, in the rainy season, is swampy and half submerged. It was\r\ncovered with flocks and herds, with huts and out-buildings scattered\r\nover it, and surrounded by mud walls. Here and there we passed pretty\r\nlittle cow-girls and shepherdesses, now dressed in the Quichua, not\r\nthe Aymara, costume. Some of these little maidens, as they stood by\r\nthe wayside spinning wool, had such pretty faces, with the rosy colour\r\nshowing through their soft, brown skins, and their figures were so\r\ngraceful and dignified, that they strongly reminded me of the pictures\r\nof young Inca princesses in the churches of Santa Anna, and of the\r\nJesuits, at Cuzco:--\r\n\r\n  \"La vi tan fermosa\r\n  Que apenas creyera\r\n  Que fuese vaquera\r\n  De la Finojosa.\"\r\n\r\nPotatoes, quinoa, and barley were cultivated in the skirts of the hills\r\nbordering on the plain.\r\n\r\nThe village of Caracoto is at the extreme end of a long rocky spur,\r\nrunning out across the plain; a street of neat mud huts, with a plaza\r\nand dilapidated church. At the post-house a child had died, which was\r\nset out on a table with candles burning before it, and the friends of\r\nthe postmaster were holding a wake, singing, fiddling, and drinking.\r\nBetween Caracoto and the next village of Juliaca there is another\r\nswampy plain: most of the road was under water, and we encountered a\r\nheavy hail-storm. The lights and shades on the cordilleras and nearer\r\nhills, the heavy black masses of cloud in one part of the heavens, and\r\nthe sun's rays breaking through in the other, were very fine. Juliaca\r\nis a small town built under a spur of the mountains, with a handsome\r\nstone church. It was Easter-Sunday, and I was invited to meet all the\r\nprincipal families at dinner at the house of the cura. Several Indian\r\nalcaldes were in attendance; consequential old fellows in full dress,\r\nconsisting of broad-brimmed black felt hats, sober-coloured ponchos,\r\nand black breeches very open at the knees, no stockings, and _usutas_\r\nor sandals of llama-hide. The distinctive mark of the alcaldes, of\r\nwhich they are very proud, is their staff of office, with silver or\r\nbrass head and ferule, and rings round it according to the number of\r\nyears the owner has held office. The Indians here wear the hair in\r\nnumbers of very fine plaits reaching half-way down their backs. An\r\nIndian always accompanied the post-mules from one village to another,\r\nin order to take back the return-mules; and at Juliaca, while I was\r\nquietly enjoying the cura's hospitality, the Indians took my own mule\r\nback to Caracoto, as well as the post-mules. Next morning, therefore,\r\nI sent for it, and received an answer that the postmaster knew nothing\r\nabout it. I was eventually obliged, after seeing the gardener and\r\nluggage on their way to Lampa, to go back to Caracoto, where the\r\npostmaster was drunk and insolent; and at length I found it, with a\r\ntroop of others, on the great plain beyond Caracoto. Several Indians\r\ntook much trouble for me in catching my mule; and it was late in the\r\nafternoon before I got back to Juliaca, and was ready to set out on my\r\njourney to Lampa. I mention this incident in order to show the trouble\r\nand inconvenience of acting as one's own muleteer, although such a\r\nmode of travelling is certainly four or five times as cheap as hiring\r\nan arriero; and I may add that the travelling by post-mules caused me\r\nincessant annoyance and trouble. Whenever they saw a chance the vicious\r\nbrutes always ran off the road in different directions, bumped their\r\ncargo against rocks, and tried to roll, keeping us constantly employed\r\nin galloping after them, and greatly increasing the fatigues of the\r\njourneys. On several occasions, too, an animal was provided which was\r\nso weak or tired that it sank under its cargo before it had gone a\r\nleague, and obliged me to return to the post-house for another. The\r\nadjustment and lashing of the cargos, like everything else, requires\r\nconsiderable knack and skill, which is only acquired by experience; the\r\nIndians were as ignorant in such matters as we were; and during the\r\nfirst three or four journeys our troubles were increased by the cargos\r\nconstantly slipping on one side, when the mules always seized the\r\nopportunity of rushing off the road and kicking furiously.\r\n\r\nA few miles north of Juliaca there is a large river, formed by the\r\njunction of those of Lampa and Cavanilla, the latter being the same\r\nwhich rises in the lake on the road between Arequipa and Puno, and\r\nflows by the post-house of La Compuerta. We crossed it in a reed\r\nbalsa while the mules swam. Beyond the river is the great plain of\r\nChañucahua, which was covered with large pools of water, at this\r\nseason frequented by ducks and sandpipers. Close under the mountains,\r\nwhich bound it on every side, were a few sheep-farms, one of them\r\nthe property of Don Manuel Costas of Puno, and the sheep roamed at\r\nwill over many leagues of pasture-land. At the northern extremity of\r\nthe plain the road ascends and descends a range of steep hills, and,\r\nturning a rocky spur, I came in sight of the town of Lampa. It was just\r\nsunset; the tall church-tower rising over the town, and a stone bridge\r\nspanning the river, were clearly defined by the crimson glow in the\r\nwestern sky, while the lofty peaked mountains forming the background\r\nwere capped by masses of black threatening clouds. At that moment a\r\ntremendous thunder-storm, with flashes of forked lightning and torrents\r\nof rain, burst over the town.\r\n\r\nLampa is the capital of a province in the department of Puno, and I\r\nwas hospitably received by the Sub-prefect, Don Manuel Barrio-nuevo,\r\nwho occupied a good house in the plaza. A portion of the army of the\r\nSouth was quartered in the town; and the General came every evening to\r\nhave tea with the Sub-prefect and his lady, a handsome Arequipeña. On\r\nthese occasions the party consisted of General Frisancho and several\r\nofficers, and ladies who came attended by their little Indian maids,\r\ncarrying shawls, and squatting on the floor in comers during the visit.\r\nAfter tea and conversation the company generally sang some of the\r\n_despedidas_ and love-songs of their national poet Melgar, in parts;\r\nand one young lady sang the plaintive _yaravis_ of the Indians in\r\nQuichua.\r\n\r\nThe church of Lampa is a large building of stone, dating from 1685,\r\nwith a dome of yellow, green, and blue glazed tiles, of which I was\r\ninformed there was formerly a manufactory in Lampa. The tower is\r\nisolated, and about twenty yards from the church, apparently of a\r\ndifferent date. Rows of Indian girls, in their gay-coloured dresses,\r\nwere sitting in the plaza before their little heaps of chuñus, ocas,\r\npotatoes, and other provisions, amongst which, at the season of\r\nEaster, there are always great quantities of herbs gathered on the\r\nmountains, possessing supposed medicinal virtues. Among these a fern,\r\ncalled _racci-racci_, is used as an emetic; _churccu-churccu_, a small\r\nwild oxalis, is taken as a cure for colds; _chichira_, the root of\r\na small crucifer, for rheumatism; _llacua-llacua_, a composita, for\r\ncuring wounds; _quissu_, a nettle, used as a purgative; _cata-cata_,\r\na valerian, as an antispasmodic; _tami-tami_, the root of a gentian,\r\nas a febrifuge; _quachanca_, a euphorbia, the powdered root of which\r\nis taken as a purgative; _hama-hama_, the root of a valerian, said\r\nto be an excellent specific against epilepsy;[282] and many others,\r\nthe native names of which, with their uses, were given me, but I was\r\nunacquainted with their botanical names. Generally when the name of a\r\nplant is repeated twice in Quichua it denotes the possession of some\r\nmedicinal property.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of our departure from Lampa the ground was covered\r\nwith snow, which was slowly melting under the sun's rays. Immediately\r\nafter leaving the town the path winds up a steep mountain range\r\ncalled Chacun-chaca, the sides of the precipitous slopes being well\r\nclothed with _queñua_-trees (_Polylepis tomentella_, Wedd.), which are\r\ngnarled and stunted, with dark-green leaves, and the bark of the trunk\r\npeeling like that of a yew. Their sombre foliage contrasted with the\r\nlight-green tufts of _stipa_, and the patches of snow. The pass was\r\nlong and dangerous, with little torrents pouring down every rut; and on\r\nits summit was the usual _pacheta_, or cairn, which the Indians erect\r\non every conspicuous point. The path descends on the other side into a\r\nlong narrow plain, with the hacienda of Chacun-chaca on the opposite\r\nside. The buildings are surrounded by queñua-trees, and in their rear\r\ntwo remarkable peaked hills rise up abruptly, clothed with the same\r\ntrees, with ridges of rock cropping out at intervals. Their sides were\r\ndotted with cattle, tended by pretty little cow-girls, armed with\r\nslings, and some of them playing the _pincullu_, or Indian flute. The\r\nplain was covered with long grass, in a saturated and spongy state, and\r\ngroves of queñua-trees grew thickly in the gullies of the mountains on\r\neither side. After a ride of several leagues over the plain, latterly\r\nalong the banks of the river Pucara, I turned a point of the road, and\r\nsuddenly came in sight of the almost perpendicular mountain, closely\r\nresembling the northern end of the rock of Gibraltar, which rises\r\nabruptly from the plain, with the little town of Pucara nestling at\r\nits feet. The precipice is composed of a reddish sandstone, upwards of\r\ntwelve hundred feet above the plain, the crevices and summit clothed\r\nwith long grass and shrubby queñuas. Birds were whirling in circles at\r\na great height above the rock, which, in the Spanish times, was famous\r\nfor a fine breed of falcons, which were carefully guarded and regularly\r\nsupplied with meat. They tell a story at Pucara that one of these birds\r\nwas sent to the King of Spain, and that it returned of its own accord,\r\nbeing known by the collar.\r\n\r\nPucara means a fortress in Quichua; and here Francisco Hernandez Giron,\r\nthe rebel who led an insurrection to oppose the abolition of personal\r\nservice amongst the Indians, was finally defeated in 1554. The town is\r\na little larger than Juliaca, with a handsome church in the same style,\r\nand a fountain in the plaza. I dined and passed the evening with the\r\naged cura, Dr. José Faustino Dava, who is famous for his knowledge of\r\nthe Quichua language, in its purest and most classical form. The fame\r\nof Dr. Dava's learning, in all questions connected with the antiquities\r\nof the Incas and the Quichua language, had reached me in England, and I\r\nwas glad to obtain his valuable assistance in looking over a dictionary\r\nof the rich and expressive language of the Incas, on which I had been\r\nworking for some time.\r\n\r\nOwing to the diminution of the aboriginal population in Peru, and the\r\nconstantly increasing corruption of the ancient language, through\r\nthe substitution of Spanish for Quichua words, the introduction of\r\nSpanish modes of expression, and the loss of all purity of style,\r\nthat language, once so important, which was used by a polished court\r\nand civilized people, which was spoken through the extent of a vast\r\nempire, and the use of which was spread by careful legislation, is\r\nnow disappearing. Before long it will be a thing that is past, or\r\nperhaps fade away entirely from the memory of living generations. With\r\nit will disappear the richest form of all the great American group of\r\nlanguages, no small loss to the student of ethnology. With it will be\r\nlost all the traditions which yet remain of the old glory of the Incas,\r\nall the elegies, love-songs, and poems which stamp the character of a\r\nonce powerful, but always gentle and amiable race.\r\n\r\nUnlike the English in India, the half-Spanish races of Peru have paid\r\nlittle attention to the history and languages of the aborigines, within\r\nthe present century; and, if left to them, all traces of the language\r\nof the Incas, and of the songs and traditions which remain in it,\r\nwould, in the course of another century, almost entirely disappear. A\r\nfew honourable exceptions must, however, be recorded. The late Mariano\r\nRivero paid much attention to the antiquities of his country, and the\r\nresults of his labours have been published at Vienna.[283] The curas\r\nof some of the parishes in the interior, also, especially Dr. Dava of\r\nPucara, Dr. Rosas of Chinchero, and the Cura of Oropesa, near Cuzco,\r\nare excellent Quichua scholars, but they are very old men, and their\r\nknowledge will die with them.\r\n\r\nDr. Dava had a large collection of the finches, and other birds of the\r\nloftier parts of the Andes, hanging in wicker cages along the wall of\r\nhis house. Amongst them were a little dove called _urpi_; the bright\r\nyellow little songster called _silgarito_ in Spanish, and _cchaiña_ in\r\nQuichua; the _tuya_, another larger warbler; the _chocclla-poccochi_\r\nor nightingale of Peru; and a little finch with glossy black plumage,\r\npink on the back, and whitish-grey under the wings. He also had some\r\nsmall green paroquets, with long tails and bluish wings, which make\r\ntheir nests under the eaves of roofs, at a height of fourteen thousand\r\nfeet above the sea. At Pucara some of the inhabitants have small\r\nmanufactories for making glazed earthenware basins, pots, plates, and\r\ncups,[284] which find an extensive market in the villages and towns of\r\nthe department of Puno, and which will probably long hold their own\r\nagainst the same kind of coarse wares from Europe or the United States.\r\n\r\nFrom Puno to Pucara I had travelled along the main-road to Cuzco; but,\r\nat the latter place, I branched off to the eastward, to pass through\r\nthe province of Azangaro to that of Caravaya. The main-road continues\r\nin a northerly direction, crosses the snowy range of Vilcañota near\r\nAyaviri, and descends the valley of the Vilcamayu to Cuzco. At Pucara I\r\nleft post-houses and post-mules behind me, for they only exist on the\r\nmain-roads between Arequipa, Puno, Cuzco, and Lima; henceforth I had to\r\ndepend on being able to induce private persons to let out their mules\r\nor ponies to me.\r\n\r\nAbout 500 yards from the town of Pucara is the river of the same name,\r\nwhich flows past Ayaviri in the mountains of Vilcañota. It was very\r\nfull, and eighty yards across. The mules swam, and we had to cross in a\r\nrickety balsa made of two bundles of reeds, which had to go backwards\r\nand forwards five times before all the gear and baggage was on the\r\neastern side. After riding over a plain which became gradually narrower\r\nas the mountains closed in, I began the ascent of a rocky _cuesta_,\r\nwith a torrent dashing down over huge boulders into the plain. There\r\nwas a splendid view of the distant rock of Pucara, with the snowy\r\npeaks of the Vilcañota range behind. A league further on there was an\r\nalpine lake, with a fine peaked cliff rising up from the water's edge.\r\nThere were many ducks and widgeons, and large coots were quietly busy,\r\nswimming about and building their nests on little reed islands; also\r\njet-black ibises, with dark rusty red heads and long curved bills.\r\nAfter a ride of several leagues over a grassy country covered with\r\nflocks of sheep, I reached the summit of a range of hills, and got a\r\ndistant view of the town of Azangaro, in a plain with several isolated\r\nsteep grassy mountains rising from it, and the snowy Andes of Caravaya\r\nin the background. After a very wearisome descent I reached the plain,\r\nand, riding into Azangaro, was most hospitably and kindly received by\r\nDon Luis Quiñones, one of the principal inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe region which I had traversed between Puno and Azangaro is all of\r\nthe same character--a series of grassy plains of great elevation,\r\ncovered with flocks and herds, and watered by numerous rivers flowing\r\ninto lake Titicaca, which are traversed by several mountain-ranges,\r\nspurs from the cordillera, which sometimes run up into peaks almost\r\nto the snow-line, and at others sink into rocky plateaux raised like\r\nsteps above the plain. What strikes one most in travelling through\r\nthis country is the evidence of the vast population it must have\r\ncontained in the days of the Incas, indicated by the ruined remains of\r\n_andeneria_, or terraces for cultivation, rising in every direction\r\ntier above tier up the sides of the hills. But it is now almost\r\nexclusively a grazing country, and the Indians, employed in tending the\r\nlarge flocks of sheep, only raise a sufficient supply of edible roots\r\nfor the consumption of their families, and the market of the nearest\r\ntown. Frequently the shepherds are what are called _yanaconas_, or\r\nIndians kept to service by the owners of the flocks, which vary from\r\n400 to 1000 head. The condition of this class of Indians is very hard,\r\nas they get only a monthly allowance of an _arroba_ of chuñu (frozen\r\npotato) or quinoa, and a pound of coca, or four dollars a month in\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nPuno, Juliaca, Lampa, Pucara, and Azangaro, are all between 12,800\r\nand 13,000 feet above the sea. Between March 28th and April 15th, the\r\nindications of the thermometer at these places were as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Mean temperature        52-1/2°\r\n  Mean minimum at night   37-1/4\r\n  Highest observed        58\r\n  Lowest                  37\r\n  Range                   21\r\n\r\nAzangaro is the capital of the province of the same name. There is a\r\ntradition that, when the Indians were bringing gold and silver for\r\nthe ransom of the Inca Atahualpa, they received news of his murder\r\nby Pizarro, at Sicuani, and at the same time orders came from Inca\r\nManco, who was at Cuzco, to remove the treasure to a greater distance;\r\nand that they buried it near this town. _Asuan_ is \"more,\" _carun_\r\n\"distant;\" hence _Azangaro_. It is generally believed that this\r\ntreasure, worth 7,000,000 dollars, as well as the fifteen mule-loads\r\nof church-plate brought into the town by Diego Tupac Amaru in 1781,\r\nare concealed somewhere, and that some of the Indians know the place\r\nwell, but will not divulge it. Hence there have been numerous attempts\r\nto discover it, and one sub-prefect made several excavations under the\r\npavement in the church, but without any success. On one occasion, not\r\nlong ago, an old Indian, who had been a servant in the house where\r\nDiego Tupac Amaru lodged, told the sub-prefect that in the centre of\r\nthe _sala_, after digging down for about two feet, a layer of gravel\r\nfrom the river would be reached; a little further down a layer of\r\nlime and plaster; a little further a layer of large stones; and that\r\nbeneath the stones would be the treasure. The excavation was commenced,\r\nand great was the excitement when all the different layers were found\r\nexactly as the Indian had described them; but there was no treasure. It\r\nis not unlikely that the Indian only knew or only told half the clue;\r\nand that these layers were some mark, whence a line was to be measured\r\nin some particular direction, and to a certain distance, to denote the\r\nspot under which the treasure was deposited. Yet the searches have not\r\nbeen wholly unsuccessful. There are several subterranean passages and\r\nchambers under Azangaro, and one was discovered a few years ago which\r\nhad been made by the Indians in ancient times. It led towards the\r\nplaza, and ended in a recess, where there were several mummies, adorned\r\nwith golden suns and armlets, and golden semispheres covering their\r\nears--now the property of my host, Don Luis Quiñones.\r\n\r\nAzangaro is _par excellence_ the city of hidden treasure. The houses\r\nare built of mud and straw, and thatched with coarse grass (_stipa\r\nychu_), the better sort being whitewashed. To the north of the town\r\nthere is a long ridge of rocky heights; to the south an isolated peaked\r\nhill nearly overhangs the town; to the east is the river; and to the\r\nwest is a plain bounded by the mountains towards Pucara. The church,\r\nin the plaza, is like a large barn outside, with walls of mud and\r\nstraw, and a tower with broad-brimmed red-tiled roof; but on entering\r\nit I was astonished at its extraordinary magnificence, so entirely out\r\nof proportion to the wealth or importance of this little town. The\r\nnave is lined with large pictures on religious subjects, by native\r\nartists, in frames of carved wood richly gilt. The elaborate gilded\r\ncarving was very striking; the leaves, bunches of grapes, and twisted\r\ncolumns, being the workmanship of the famous carvers of Cuzco. Over\r\nthe arch leading to the chancel there is a picture representing the\r\nTriumph of the Faith, in bright colours. The high altar is plated with\r\nmassive silver, with gilded columns, pictures, and images, in gorgeous\r\nprofusion up to the roof. On either side are two very remarkable\r\npictures, filling the walls between the altar and the chancel-arch. On\r\nthe right an allegorical picture, and the Shepherds worshipping. One\r\nfigure, in the latter picture, a girl holding a basket on her head,\r\nis of great merit, and exactly resembles the 'Santa Justa' of Murillo\r\nin the Duke of Sutherland's collection. On the left is a picture of\r\nthe 'Woman taken in Adultery,' and an excellent copy of the well-known\r\n'Worshipping of the Magi,' by Rubens, in the Madrid gallery. In a side\r\nchapel there is a copy of Leonardo da Vinci's 'Last Supper,' with\r\nportraits of two caciques--the heads of the two great families of\r\nAzangero--with their wives, one of them very pretty, looking on in a\r\ncorner. These copies, which are excellent, must have been procured from\r\nEurope at very great expense.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SONDOR-HUASI, AT AZANGARO. Page 193.]\r\n\r\nThe author of all this magnificence, according to the inscription on\r\nhis portrait, which is fixed in a handsome gilt frame by the side\r\nof the chancel arch, was the Bachiller Dr. Don Basco Bernardo Lopez\r\nde Cangas, a native of Cuzco, and Cura of Azangaro. The interior\r\ndecorations were completed on January 12th, 1758, and the cura died in\r\n1771. He must have been possessed of enormous wealth, to have enabled\r\nhim thus to beautify and adorn his church with such lavish profusion.\r\n\r\nIn the days of the Incas the two great families of Azangaro, whose\r\nheads ranked as Curacas, were the Murumallcucalcinas and Chuquihuancas;\r\nand they retained the office of cacique until recent Spanish times.\r\nThe Murumallcucalcina family is now extinct: they lived in the town,\r\nand a portion of their house still remains, called the _Sondor-huasi_,\r\ndating from the time of the Incas, and the greatest curiosity in the\r\nplace. It is a circular building, about twelve feet in diameter, with\r\nwalls twelve feet high, of mud and straw, very strong and thick. The\r\ndome-shaped roof of thatch also dates from the time of the Incas. The\r\noutside coating consists of a layer of _stipa ychu_, two feet thick,\r\nplaced in very regular rows, and most carefully finished, so as to\r\npresent a smooth surface to the weather. Next there is a thick layer of\r\nthe same grass placed horizontally, netted together with reeds; and\r\nfinally an inner perpendicular layer; the whole thatch being five feet\r\nthick. The interior framework consists of twelve perfect circles of\r\nbent wands, with others descending in curves from the apex of the roof\r\nto the crest of the wall, and where they cross there are lashings of a\r\ntough reed. The whole is finished with most admirable neatness, forming\r\na perfect dome. This is the only roof of the time of the Incas still\r\nremaining in Peru, and hence its great importance in an antiquarian\r\npoint of view. It has been said that the colossal and highly-finished\r\nmasonry of the Incas, and their poor thatched roofs, formed a barbaric\r\ncontrast; but the Sondor-huasi proves that their roofs rivalled\r\ntheir walls in the exquisite art and neatness of their finish. The\r\nSondor-huasi is now in a very dilapidated state, and is used as a\r\nkitchen by the degenerate collateral heirs of the old caciques.\r\n\r\nThe Chuquihuanca family had a country house about a league from\r\nAzangaro, which was destroyed by the army of Tupac Amaru in 1780,\r\nbecause the Chuquihuancas deserted their countrymen and adhered to\r\nthe Spanish cause. I accompanied Don Luis Quiñones, and the whole\r\nof the society of Azangaro, to a picnic at the ruined house of the\r\nChuquihuancas; and it was amusing to see all the masters of families,\r\nthe Sub-Prefect Don Hipolito Valdez, the judge, the cura, and every\r\none else, locking the great folding-doors leading into their _patios_,\r\nand putting the keys into their pockets. Azangaro was entirely\r\ndeserted. We were all well mounted, and there were fourteen young\r\nladies of the party, fresh pleasant girls, who thoroughly enjoyed\r\na good gallop. The ruined house was in a corner of the plain, and\r\nsurrounded on three sides by steep overhanging cliffs. There are the\r\nremains of a house, with a long corridor of brick arches, behind\r\nwhich several broad terraces rise up the face of the cliff, which\r\nare still ornamented with some fine _oliva silvestre_ and _queñua_\r\ntrees, a few ancient apple-trees, and a dense growth of bright-yellow\r\nCompositæ, and Solanums with a purple flower. A noisy torrent foamed\r\ndown the cliffs and over the terraces to the plain below. It was a\r\nvery pretty spot, but in a most desolate condition, and many small\r\ndoves made their nests in the trees. Lupins (_ccerra_[285]) and\r\nnettles (_itapallu_) were growing in the crevices of the rocks. We\r\nhad an excellent and very merry dinner; a large amount of Moquegua\r\nwine, and of the better-clarified and more generous liquor from Don\r\nDomingo Elias's vineyards at Pisco, were drunk; and guitar-playing and\r\nsamocueca-dancing finished the day's entertainment. We returned to\r\nAzangaro after dark. Don Luis assured me that the people of this little\r\ntown were like one family; and that, though election-time or periods\r\nof civil dissension sometimes caused estrangement amongst them, the\r\nhabitual concord and friendship always returned when the excuse for\r\nalienation had passed away.\r\n\r\nAzangaro is a great cattle-breeding province, and there is a\r\nconsiderable trade in cheeses with Arequipa and other parts. I found\r\nvery great difficulty in procuring animals to enable me to continue\r\nmy journey. At length I succeeded in hiring four miserable-looking,\r\nvicious, undersized ponies; and, having crossed the Azangaro on balsas,\r\nby far the largest river I had passed over since leaving Puno, the\r\nway led over the rocky range of Pacobamba hills into another plain,\r\nwhere there were several cattle and sheep farms; and the village of\r\nCorruarini, consisting of a ruined church and a dozen huts. The river\r\nAzangaro rises in the snowy mountains of Caravaya, forms an immense\r\ncurve of nearly half a circle in a course of about two hundred miles,\r\nand, uniting with the river of Pucara, falls into the lake of Titicaca\r\nas the river Ramiz, the largest of its affluents. After a ride of six\r\nleagues we reached the little village of San José, under a conical\r\nhill, and close to the snowy mountains of Surupana.\r\n\r\nI dined with the cura, Fray Juan de Dios Cardenas, who gave me a\r\nlist of medicinal herbs used in Azangaro; and the beasts from that\r\nplace were so infamous that I was obliged to invoke his assistance\r\nto procure fresh ones. It appeared that two Frenchmen had passed a\r\nfew days before, on their way to establish a saw-mill in the Caravaya\r\nforests, with a view to floating timber down the river of Azangaro to\r\nlake Titicaca, and that they had ill-treated some Indians. It was thus\r\nvery difficult to induce them to furnish ponies, but the alcaldes,\r\nwith their great hats and long sticks, were summoned, and, after some\r\nnegotiation, they were induced to supply four ponies to go as far as\r\nCrucero, the capital of the province of Caravaya. It was most fortunate\r\nthat I was enabled to do this, for, during the night, the owners of the\r\nAzangaro ponies came out to San José, and stole them, so that we should\r\nhave been left without even this wretched means of conveyance.\r\n\r\nFrom San José the path winds up a long ravine for several leagues,\r\ndown which a torrent dashes furiously over the rocks, descending\r\nfrom the snowy peak of Accosiri. The mountain scenery, consisting\r\nof steep grassy slopes, masses of rock, torrents, and distant snowy\r\npeaks, was very fine. The ravine led up to the summit of the pass\r\nof Surupana, where it was intensely cold, and the height of which\r\nI roughly estimated, with a boiling-point thermometer, at 16,700\r\nfeet above the sea. Here I met an active young vicuña-hunter, well\r\nmounted, and provided with a gun, who said he was a servant of the\r\nCacique Chuquihuanca of Azangaro, on his way to buy wool in Caravaya.\r\nHe continued in my company during most part of the day. Loud claps\r\nof thunder burst out in different directions, and a snow-storm was\r\ndrifting in our faces. The ravines were covered with deep snow,\r\nbetween high dark mountains, with abrupt cliffs cropping out. A\r\nflock of vicuñas dashed across our path, disappearing again in the\r\ndriving sleet. After wading through snow and mud for several leagues\r\nthe weather cleared up, and we began to descend a splendid gorge,\r\nexactly like some of the finest coombs on the north coast of Devon,\r\non a gigantic scale. This led us down into a valley, where I parted\r\nwith my young vicuña-hunter, who had been a very pleasant companion.\r\nRiding down the grassy valley, and passing many flocks of sheep, I rode\r\nthrough the village of Potoni, a dozen huts on the side of a hill;\r\nforded the river Azangaro, which is here but a small stream even in the\r\nrainy season; and riding up the opposite bank, got a magnificent view\r\nof the snowy mountains of Caravaya, with their sharp needle-like peaks.\r\nTwo leagues brought me to Crucero, the capital of the province of\r\nCaravaya, so called from the cross-roads which here branch off to the\r\nvarious villages in the forests on the other side of the snowy barrier\r\nwhich rises up close to the town, to the eastward.\r\n\r\nCrucero is a collection of comfortless mud-houses, with a small\r\ndilapidated church in the plaza, on a very elevated swampy plain. It\r\nwas intensely cold, with heavy snow-storms during the nights, and\r\nthe people sat wrapped up in cloaks without fires, shivering in a\r\ndreary helpless way, and going to bed soon after sunset, as the only\r\ncomfortable place. I was most kindly received by the sub-prefect, Don\r\nPablo Pimentel, a veteran soldier, and an official who had served many\r\nyears at the head of the Government in Caravaya, and in Lampa. Dr.\r\nWeddell had named a new genus of chinchonaceous plants _Pimentelia_,\r\nin honour of the worthy old sub-prefect, which had pleased him very\r\nmuch. I remained a few days in Crucero, before setting out for the\r\nchinchona-forests in the valleys of Sandia and Tambopata; and during\r\nthat time I obtained a good deal of information from Don Pablo\r\nPimentel, and from Señor Leefdael the Judge, respecting the province\r\nof Caravaya. Don Pablo had travelled over almost every part of it; and\r\nI also received much information at Arequipa from Don Agustin Aragon,\r\na former sub-prefect, who has a large estate in the Caravaya forests.\r\nFrom these sources I am enabled to offer some account of those parts\r\nof Caravaya which I did not visit, and which will form the subject of\r\nthe following chapter. Caravaya is a region of which little is known to\r\nEuropean geographers, and, so far as I am aware, no traveller has yet\r\ngiven any account of it to the English public.\r\n\r\n  Puno to Paucar-colla      9 miles.\r\n     \"    Caracoto         18   \"\r\n     \"    Juliaca           6   \"\r\n     \"    Lampa            21   \"\r\n     \"    Pucara           27   \"\r\n     \"    Azangaro         16   \"\r\n     \"    San José         18   \"\r\n     \"    Crucero          36   \"\r\n                          ---\r\n                          151   \"\r\n                          ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE PROVINCE OF CARAVAYA.\r\n\r\nA short Historical and Geographical Description.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Peruvian province of Caravaya is drained by streams which form part\r\nof the system of one of the largest and least known of the tributaries\r\nof the Amazon--the river Purus.\r\n\r\nThe Purus is the only great affluent flowing into the Amazon from\r\nthe south, the course of which has never yet been explored. We have\r\ndetailed accounts of the Huallaga from Maw, Smyth, Poeppig, and\r\nHerndon; of the Ucayali from Smyth, Herndon, and Castelnau; and of\r\nthe Madeira from Castelnau and Gibbon; but of the Purus, the largest\r\napparently, and one which, in course of time, will probably become the\r\nmost important, we have next to nothing. Its mouth, and the course of\r\nits tributaries, near the base of the Andes, are alone described.\r\n\r\nCondamine and Smyth, in descending the Amazon, mention the great depth\r\nand volume of water at the mouth of the Purus: Herndon heard from\r\na Brazilian trader at Barra, who had ascended its stream for some\r\ndistance, that it was of great size, and without obstructions; and\r\nHaënke, in the last century, arguing from reliable geographical data\r\nwhich he had collected from Indians, stated his conviction that a very\r\nlarge river, flowing from the Andes east of Cuzco, reached the Amazon\r\nto the westward of the mouth of the Madeira.\r\n\r\nThis is the sum of our knowledge of the mouth and lower course of the\r\nPurus. The tributaries which flow into it drain the eastern slopes\r\nof the Andes, from the latitude of Cuzco quite to the frontier of\r\nBolivia--that frontier dividing the streams flowing into the Purus, on\r\nthe Peruvian side, from those which feed the Beni, on the Bolivian.\r\nThese affluents of the Purus are divided into three distinct systems:\r\nthe furthest to the north and west, consisting of the streams flowing\r\nthrough the great valley of Paucartambo, which unite under the name\r\nof the Madre de Dios, or Amaru-mayu; the middle system, draining the\r\nravines of Marcapata and Ollachea; and the southern and eastern, being\r\nthe numerous rivers in the province of Caravaya, as far as the Bolivian\r\nfrontier, which unite as the Ynambari. The Madre de Dios and Ynambari\r\ntogether form the main stream of the Purus.\r\n\r\nThe Paucartambo system is the only one which has, as yet, been\r\ndescribed by modern explorers. In Spanish times the streams which\r\ncompose it were explored, and farms of cacao and coca were established\r\non their banks; and in the end of the last century an expedition was\r\nsent to explore the course of the Madre de Dios, under an officer\r\nnamed Don Tiburcio de Landa. This must have been at some time previous\r\nto 1780, for Landa was killed in that year in the great rebellion of\r\nthe Indians under Tupac Amaru.[286] After the declaration of Peruvian\r\nindependence, General Gamarra, the first Republican Prefect of Cuzco,\r\nsent an expedition to protect the farms in the valley of Paucartambo\r\nfrom the encroachments of the wild Chuncho Indians, and to explore\r\nthe Madre de Dios. It was commanded by a Dr. Sevallos, now a very\r\nold man, retired to a farm in the Caravaya forests, but he has,\r\nunfortunately, lost his journal. General Miller made an expedition\r\ninto the same region in 1835, and penetrated to a greater distance\r\nthan any other explorer before or since. A very brief account of his\r\njourney was published in the 'Royal Geographical Society's Journal'\r\nfor 1836; but there is a much fuller and most interesting journal kept\r\nby this gallant veteran, which has never been printed. In 1852 Lieut.\r\nGibbon, U.S.N., entered the valleys of Paucartambo; and in 1853 I\r\nexplored a part of the course of its principal stream, the Tono.[287]\r\nAnother expedition to explore this region, under the sanction and with\r\nthe aid of the Peruvian Government, was undertaken by some native\r\nadventurers, accompanied by a few Americans, and an English artist\r\nnamed Prendergast, in 1856, but it completely failed. Since that time\r\nthe wild Chuncho Indians have continued to attack and encroach upon the\r\nfew farms which existed in these valleys at the time of my visit in\r\n1853, and at the present moment there is not one remaining. The rich\r\nvalleys of Paucartambo, once covered with flourishing cacao and coca\r\nfarms, have again become one vast uncultivated tropical forest.\r\n\r\nFollowing the eastern slopes of the Andes to the south and east, we\r\nnext come to the streams which drain the valleys of Marcapata and\r\nOllachea, but of these very little is known. These valleys are in the\r\nprovince of Quispicanchi, in the department of Cuzco; and it is said\r\nthat in times past they were cultivated with advantage, and contained\r\nmany coca farms. In the beginning of the last century a Jesuit found\r\ngold in a hill called Camante, in the Marcapata valley, situated\r\nbetween two ravines, in one of which, called Garrote, a Spanish company\r\nestablished gold-washings. The leading man of this company, named\r\nGoyguro, employed hundreds of Indians, and extracted gold from the\r\nCamante hill in lumps; but one day an immense landslip fell into the\r\nVilca-mayu,[288] the chief stream of Marcapata, and all the workmen\r\nran away, and could not be induced to return. This was in about the\r\nyear 1788.\r\n\r\nFor forty years after this event coca-farms and gold-washings were\r\nalike abandoned in Marcapata, until in 1828 the cura of the village\r\nof that name, Dr. Pedro Flores, again opened a road into the valleys,\r\nand, with some associates, established several farms for raising coca\r\nand fruit. In 1836 a company was formed by several young adventurers,\r\nthe chief of whom were José Maria Pacheco of Cuzco and José Maria\r\nOchoa[289] of Huara, with the object of again discovering the\r\nlong-lost golden hill of Camante. The party assembled at Ocongate,\r\nin the cold region of the Andes, whence the distance to Marcapata,\r\nat the commencement of the warm valleys, is fourteen leagues over a\r\nbad road, which traverses the cordillera of Ausungate and Pirhuayani.\r\nFrom Marcapata the two adventurers Pacheco and Ochoa, both active and\r\nintrepid young men, advanced into the forests with fourteen Indians,\r\nand a stock of chuñus and dried meat. These explorers penetrated for\r\nseveral leagues, following the course of the Vilca-mayu, but their\r\nexpedition led to no practical results.[290] In 1851 Colonel Bologenesi\r\nbecame the manager of an expedition for collecting chinchona-bark in\r\nthe forests of Marcapata, and proceeded to the scene of his labours,\r\naccompanied by a young Englishman named George Backhouse. They advanced\r\ninto the forests until they fell in with parties of wild Chuncho\r\nIndians, who were propitiated by presents of knives and other trifles,\r\nand induced to assist young Backhouse and his party in collecting bark.\r\nSome of the Chunchos, however, who had received knives, neglected to\r\nwork, which enraged the Indians in Backhouse's service, and a quarrel\r\nensued, ending in the massacre of Backhouse and all his party. Those\r\nwho were out collecting bark, on discovering what had happened, fled to\r\nColonel Bologenesi; but in their retreat, while fording a river, the\r\nChunchos poured in a volley of arrows amongst them, and killed forty of\r\ntheir number. Bologenesi then collected a military force and advanced\r\ninto the forests, where he suffered great hardships, fighting with the\r\nChunchos all day, and harassed by alarms during the night. He, however,\r\ncollected a thousand quintals of bark, at a cost of fifty lives and\r\nthree hundred thousand dollars. During this expedition indications were\r\nmet with of the ancient gold-washings.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that fevers and perilous roads are not the only\r\ndangers to be apprehended in a search for chinchona-plants.\r\n\r\nLastly, and extending for a distance of one hundred and eighty miles,\r\nfrom Marcapata to the frontier of Bolivia, is the watershed along that\r\npart of the eastern Andes known as the Snowy Range of Caravaya, where\r\nthe numerous streams take their rise which unite to form the Ynambari.\r\nThe Madre de Dios, Marcapata, and Ynambari are thus the three great\r\nsources of the Purus. The tributaries of the latter drain the province\r\nof Caravaya.\r\n\r\nThe first mention of this region is to be found in the pages of the\r\nold Inca historian, Garcilasso de la Vega, who says that \"the richest\r\ngold-mines in Peru are those of Collahuaya, which the Spaniards call\r\nCaravaya, whence they obtain much very fine gold of twenty-four carats,\r\nand they still get some, but not in such abundance.\"[291] The Jesuit\r\nAcosta also mentions \"the famous gold of Caravaya in Peru.\"[292] After\r\nthe final overthrow of the younger Almagro in the battle of Chupas in\r\n1542, some of his followers crossed the snowy range, and descended\r\ninto the great tropical forests of Caravaya,[293] where they discovered\r\nrivers, the sands of which were full of gold. On the banks of these\r\nrivers they built the towns of Sandia, San Gavan, and San Juan del\r\nOro; large sums in gold were sent home to Spain, and the last-named\r\nsettlement received the title of a royal city from Charles V. In 1553\r\nthese settlers received a pardon from the Viceroy Don Antonio de\r\nMendoza, in consideration of the gold they sent home to the Emperor. It\r\nis said that they sent him a nugget weighing four arrobas, in the shape\r\nof a bullock's head; and that afterwards another nugget, in the shape\r\nof a bullock's tongue, was sent to Philip II., but that the ship which\r\ncarried it was lost at sea. Eventually the wild Chuncho Indians of the\r\nSirineyri tribe fell upon the gold-washers, and overpowered them. In\r\nthe following century certain mulattos occupied the gold-washings in\r\nCaravaya, and the king, as a reward for their labours in extracting\r\ntreasure, offered to comply with any request they might make. The\r\nmulattos asked to be called Señores, and for the privilege of entering\r\nevery town on white mules with red trappings, and the bells ringing.\r\nThe Señores mulattos were finally expelled for knocking the priest of\r\nSan Juan del Oro on the head while he was saying mass, after a drunken\r\nbroil. There are many vestiges of washings, bridges, and cuttings made\r\nby these mulattos, in different parts of Caravaya.[294]\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards, however, long continued to extract gold from the rivers\r\nof Caravaya, and established coca-farms and coffee-plantations in some\r\nof the ravines formed by spurs of the cordillera. Gold, however, was\r\nthe product for which Caravaya was most famous.\r\n\r\nIn 1615 the viceroy Marquis of Montes Claros spoke of the rich\r\n_lavaderos_ or gold-washings of Caravaya;[295] and his successor,\r\nthe Prince of Esquilache, wrote a long report upon them in 1620. It\r\nappears that, at that period, the richest of the Caravaya mines was\r\ncalled Aporuma, and that it had then been worked for fifteen years\r\nby a company of adventurers. These men, the chief of whom were named\r\nQuiñones, Frisancho, and Perez, had excavated very extensive works to\r\ndrain off the water, and they petitioned the Viceroy to grant them\r\na _mita_ of Indians to complete the works, for that thus the royal\r\nfifths would be augmented. The Prince of Esquilache wrote a marginal\r\nnote, which may still be seen on the original petition, ordering\r\nDon Pedro de Mercado, the \"visitador-general\" of Caravaya, to grant\r\nthem a _mita_ of Indians within a circuit of twenty leagues of the\r\nAporuma mine, with three dollars a month each, besides salt-meat and\r\nother provisions.[296] In 1678 the yield of the royal fifths from\r\nthe Caravaya gold-washings was at the rate of 806 dollars in three\r\nmonths.[297] From this time to the end of the seventeenth century\r\nFranciscan missionaries were at work amongst the wild Chunchos in the\r\nforests of Caravaya.[298] Towards the end of the last century Caravaya\r\nwas separated from Peru to form part of the new viceroyalty of Buenos\r\nAyres, and the population of whites and civilised Indians was then only\r\nestimated at 6500 souls. Just before that period the town of San Gavan,\r\nwith four thousand families and a large treasure, had been surprised\r\nand entirely destroyed by the Carangas and Suchimanis Chunchos. This\r\ncalamity took place on the 15th of December, 1767. The viceroy Don\r\nManuel Amat swore vengeance on the Chunchos; but his famous mistress,\r\nMariquita Gallegas, better known as La Perichola, interceded for them,\r\nand eventually nothing was done. The other town of San Juan del Oro had\r\nbeen abandoned some time before; and the very sites where they stood\r\nare now uncertain.\r\n\r\nIn the great rebellion of Tupac Amaru the caciques and people of\r\nCaravaya took part with the Indians, probably owing to the influence\r\npossessed by the Inca, arising from the large coca estate which\r\nbelonged to him near San Gavan.[299] At the independence Caravaya\r\nbecame a part of the Peruvian department of Puno.\r\n\r\nIn 1846 Don Pablo Pimentel was appointed Sub-prefect of Caravaya, and\r\nhe endeavoured, by giving a glowing account of its vast capabilities,\r\nto induce the government to make roads and develop the resources\r\nof this important province. Shortly afterwards, in 1849, Caravaya\r\nattracted notice as a land rich in the precious metal, and it soon\r\nbecame the California of South America. In July of that year two\r\nbrothers named Poblete, in searching for chinchona-bark, discovered\r\ngreat abundance of gold-dust in the sands of one of the Caravaya\r\nrivers, and the news soon spread far and wide. Up to 1852 crowds of\r\nadventurers, among whom were many Frenchmen, continued to follow in the\r\nfootsteps of the Pobletes, but most of them returned empty, and the\r\nexcitement has now died away. The trade in chinchona-bark, which once\r\nwas remunerative, and in which many Peruvians displayed extraordinary\r\nenergy and endurance of fatigue, ceased to exist in 1847, owing to the\r\nhabit of adulterating the Calisaya bark with inferior kinds, which gave\r\nthe Caravaya article a bad name in the market, and at length rendered\r\nit unsaleable. This adulteration was practised either through fraud\r\nor ignorance. If the former, it was certainly very short-sighted;\r\nbut Don Pablo Pimentel declares that it was done through ignorance,\r\nthe bark-collectors mistaking the _motosolo_ (C. micrantha) and\r\n_carhua-carhua_ (Cascarilla Carua) for the Calisaya bark.[300]\r\n\r\nThe above meagre notices are all that I have been able to glean\r\nrespecting the history of Caravaya; and I will now give a brief\r\ndescription of the geographical features of this interesting region.\r\n\r\nThe province of Caravaya consists of a narrow strip of lofty\r\ntable-land, bordering on that of Azangaro; the snowy range of the\r\nEastern Andes for a distance of 120 miles; and the boundless tropical\r\nforests to the eastward, stretching away towards the frontier of\r\nBrazil. It is bounded on the east and south by Bolivia, on the N.W. by\r\nthe province of Quispicanchi in the department of Cuzco, on the north\r\nand N.E. by the illimitable forests, and on the west by Azangaro.\r\n\r\nThe lofty table-land to the westward of the snowy Andes extends for 120\r\nmiles, the whole length of Caravaya, but is only from five to ten miles\r\nbroad. It is 13,000 feet above the level of the sea, and here, about a\r\ncentury ago, after the destruction of San Gavan, the town of Crucero\r\nwas founded, as a central position for the capital of the province, and\r\nas being free from the attacks of wild Indians. It derives its name\r\nfrom the numerous roads which branch from it to the villages on the\r\neastern slopes of the Andes. This narrow plain, on which Crucero[301]\r\nis situated, is very swampy, covered with long tufts of _ychu_ grass,\r\nand intensely cold. It yields pasture to immense flocks of sheep; and\r\nto the curious hybrid, first bred by the cura Cabrera in 1826, between\r\nan alpaca and a vicuña, called the paco-vicuña, with a black and white\r\nfleece of long fine wool, which is wove into fabrics like the richest\r\nsilk.[302]\r\n\r\nBut the largest and only important part of Caravaya consists of the\r\nforest-covered valleys to the eastward of the Andes. On the western\r\nside that mountain-chain rises abruptly into peaks covered with snow,\r\nfrom an elevated plateau 14,000 feet above the sea; but on its eastern\r\nside the descent is rapid into tropical valleys. Long spurs run off the\r\nmain chain to the northward, gradually decreasing in elevation; and it\r\nis sometimes a distance of sixty or eighty miles before they finally\r\nsubside into the boundless forest-covered plains of the interior of\r\nSouth America. Numerous rivers flow through the valleys between these\r\nspurs, to join the Ynambari; and in these valleys, near the foot of\r\nthe main chain of the eastern Andes, are the few villages and coca and\r\ncoffee plantations of Caravaya. In these long spurs and deep valleys\r\nCaravaya differs in geographical character from the more northern\r\nregion of Paucartambo, where the Andes subside much more rapidly into\r\nthe level plain.\r\n\r\nIn the warm valleys are to be found all the wealth and population of\r\nCaravaya. The population consists of 22,000 souls, almost all Indians;\r\nand the wealth, besides the flocks of sheep on the western table-land,\r\nis created by the produce of coca, coffee, sugar-cane, and aji-pepper\r\nplantations, fruit-gardens, and gold-washings. Correct statistical\r\nreturns are unknown in Peru; but, as near as I could make out, there is\r\nan annual yield of 20,000 lbs. of coffee and 360,000 lbs. of coca.[303]\r\nI could obtain no reliable statements respecting the yield of gold.\r\n\r\nThe Caravayan valley which is furthest to the north and west is that\r\nof Ollachea, bordering on Marcapata, where there is a small village\r\nat the foot of the Andes. Next come those of Ituata and Corani.\r\nThe little village of Ayapata, near the source of the river of the\r\nsame name, comes next; and thirty miles further in the interior, an\r\nintelligent and enterprising Peruvian, named Don Agustin Aragon, has\r\nestablished a sugar-cane estate called San José de Bella Vista. It\r\nis situated at the junction of two rivers, and he is thus protected\r\nfrom the attacks of the savage Chuncho Indians who prowl about in the\r\nsurrounding forests. He has made a road practicable for mules from\r\nthe village of Ayapata to his estate; and he finds the manufacture of\r\nspirits from the sugar-cane far more profitable than digging for gold\r\nor hunting for chinchona-bark. He is a man full of energy and resource.\r\nHis attempt to establish a manufactory of india-rubber only failed\r\nthrough the refusal of the Peruvian government to give him a contract\r\nfor supplying the army, and thus assist his first efforts; in 1860 he\r\nsent an expedition into the forests to collect wild cacao-plants; any\r\nscheme for developing the resources of the country is sure to receive\r\nhis advocacy; and he looks forward with confidence to the day when a\r\nsteamer shall ascend the Purus and Ynambari, and return to the Atlantic\r\nwith a cargo of the produce of Caravaya. It would be well for Peru if\r\nshe contained many such men as Don Agustin Aragon.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that the old Spanish town of San Gavan was situated near\r\na river of the same name, about twenty miles from Aragon's estate.\r\nThe site is now overgrown with dense forest, and it has never been\r\nvisited since its destruction; yet it is believed that vast treasure\r\nlies concealed amongst the tree-covered ruins, because the attack of\r\nthe Chunchos was sudden, and at once successful; they care nothing\r\nfor the precious metals, and San Gavan contained a royal treasury,\r\nand was a central deposit for the gold of Caravaya. The Chunchos,\r\nin former times, were in friendly communication with, and even took\r\nservice under, the Spaniards; but the tyranny of the latter at length\r\nexasperated them, and led to the destruction of San Gavan. Since that\r\ntime the Chunchos have wandered in the forests in small tribes,[304]\r\nthe implacable enemies of all white men and Inca Indians.\r\n\r\nFollowing the eastern slopes of the Andes to the south-east, the next\r\nvillage to Ayapata, at the head of another deep ravine, is Ccoasa, and\r\nnext follow Usicayus, Phara, and Limbani. Phara is in a ravine on the\r\neastern slope of the Andes, about thirty-five miles from Crucero. Here\r\nmany gold-mines were worked by the Señores Mulattos, and at no great\r\ndistance is the famous gold-mine of Aporuma, in the ravine of Pacchani.\r\nPhara is on the road to the gold-diggings, which were discovered by\r\nthe brothers Poblete, and which attracted so many luckless adventurers\r\nbetween 1849 and 1854. They are at a distance of fifteen leagues to\r\nthe northward. The path lies along a long ridge, gradually descending\r\nfor six leagues to a little hamlet called La Mina. Thence to the banks\r\nof the river Ynambari, here called Huari-huari, is a distance of\r\nthree leagues, down a very dangerous road, covered with huge blocks\r\nof schist, and skirting along fearful precipices. For this distance\r\nthe road is passable for mules. The river is seventy yards broad, and\r\nis crossed by an _oroya_, or bridge of ropes, traversed by a sort of\r\nnet or cage, into which the passenger gets, and is hauled over to the\r\nother side, at a giddy height above the boiling flood. On the other\r\nside, at the junction of the Huari-huari and the golden river of\r\nChalluma,[305] there is a place which has been named Versailles by\r\nsome French adventurers, of whom the most daring and energetic is a M.\r\nLa Harpe. The road, so far, was opened by a party of soldiers of the\r\nbatallion Yungay. From Versailles to the _lavaderos_ or gold-washings\r\nis a distance of six leagues up a narrow forest-covered ravine; and,\r\nin this distance, it is necessary to wade across the river Challuma no\r\nless than fifty-three times--the water coming up to the waist, the feet\r\nconstantly slipping over loose rounded stones, the only support a long\r\nstaff, and where one false step would be inevitable destruction. At\r\nthe end of this perilous journey there is a place called Alta-garcia,\r\nwhere the _administradores_ of the company of first discoverers were\r\nestablished in 1850. Thence to Quimza-mayu (three rivers) is half a\r\nleague, and here the _lavaderos_ commence. In this part of its course\r\nthe river is called Taccuma. Many of the gold-seekers, such as the\r\nSeñores Carpio, La Harpe, Valdez, Tovar, Cardenas, and Costas, have\r\nbeen men who were formerly engaged in the chinchona-bark trade, and who\r\nknow the country thoroughly. The tributaries of the Challuma, called\r\nQuimza-mayu, rise in hills completely isolated from the Andes, and\r\ntheir sands are full of gold, both in dust and nuggets. Immediately\r\nabove the _lavaderos_ rises a hill called Capacurco, and by the French\r\nadventurers Montebello, formed of quartz and other primitive rocks,\r\nwith rich veins of gold. Here Don Manuel Costas of Puno erected a\r\nhouse, and brought out machinery for crushing the quartz, but the\r\nundertaking failed through the badness of the machinery, and the\r\nimmense cost and difficulty of transporting materials through such\r\na country. A few adventurers, however, still continue to wash for\r\ngold in the Challuma or Taccuma. In the part of its course above\r\nthe _lavaderos_ this river descends rapidly from an isolated range\r\nof forest-covered precipitous hills, and in one place its waters\r\nplunge down in a cascade, with a sheer fall of forty feet.[306] The\r\ngold-seekers of the Challuma have penetrated further into the forests,\r\nand nearer to the main stream of the Purus, than any other explorers;\r\nand their discovery of the Challuma, and of the auriferous hills near\r\nits banks, has added something to our geographical knowledge of this\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nThe remaining villages on the eastern slopes of the Caravayan Andes\r\nare Patambuco, Sandia, Cuyo-cuyo, Quiaca, Sina, and the farm of Saqui,\r\non the frontier of Bolivia. The river of Sandia has one of its sources\r\nnear the pass twenty miles north-east of Crucero, whence it flows past\r\nSandia, and for many leagues down a narrow gorge, with magnificent\r\nmountains rising up abruptly on either side. At a distance of twenty\r\nmiles below Sandia, in a part of the ravine called Ypara, the coca\r\nand coffee plantations commence, at a height of 5000 feet above the\r\nsea. Beyond Ypara cultivation ceases, and the river, now increased to\r\ndouble its former size by its junction with the Huari-huari, flows for\r\nmany leagues between mountains covered from their summits with a dense\r\ntropical forest. This region is known as San Juan del Oro, once famous\r\nfor its gold-washings; and here the royal town of the same name stood,\r\nfounded by the fugitive Almagristas, and afterwards tenanted by the\r\nSeñores Mulattos, but long since destroyed and abandoned. The forests\r\ncontain chinchona-trees of valuable species, and, until the last\r\nfourteen years, they were frequented by bark-collectors.\r\n\r\nWhile flowing through the forests of San Juan del Oro the river takes\r\na turn to the westward, and, at a distance of sixty miles from Sandia,\r\nenters the Hatun-yunca, or Valle Grande, where the people of Sandia\r\nhave very extensive coca and coffee plantations. The curve here made\r\nby the river is so considerable that the people from Sandia reach\r\ntheir farms in the Valle Grande by leaving the ravine above Ypara, and\r\nmaking their way across the grass-covered mountains. The coffee-plants\r\nin these farms receive no attention whatever from the time they are\r\nplanted, so that, instead of the dense well-pruned bushes of India or\r\nCeylon, they grow into tall straggling trees about twelve feet high,\r\nwith a very small harvest of berries on each, but each berry well\r\nexposed to the sun. The coffee is certainly excellent.\r\n\r\nPassing through the Valle Grande the river flows on past Versailles,\r\nwhere it receives the golden Challuma, and, uniting with all the other\r\nrivers of Caravaya, becomes that great Ynambari which finally effects\r\na junction with the Madre de Dios, and forms the main stream of the\r\nmighty Purus.\r\n\r\nThe river Huari-huari, which is formed by two streams flowing from the\r\nvillages of Sina and Quiaca, joins the river of Sandia about thirty\r\nmiles below that town, and their united streams compose the Ynambari.\r\nFinally the river Tambopata rises near a farm called Saqui, just within\r\nthe boundary between Peru and Bolivia, at the foot of a ridge of the\r\nEastern Cordillera. After a course of forty miles it receives the river\r\nof San Blas, on the banks of which the people of the Sina village have\r\ntheir coca-plantations. Eighty miles lower down the Tambopata unites\r\nwith the river Pablo-bamba, on its right bank, at a place called\r\nPutina-puncu. The Pablo-bamba rises in a hill called Corpa-ychu on\r\nthe very frontier of Bolivia, and is only divided from the Tambopata,\r\nduring its whole course, by a single range of hills. The frontier\r\nbetween the two republics has never been surveyed. Below Putina-puncu\r\nthe united waters of the two rivers enter the vast forest-covered\r\nplains into which the spurs of the Andes finally subside, and\r\nhenceforth its course is entirely unknown. I think it probable,\r\nhowever, that the Tambopata finds its way direct to the Purus, without\r\npreviously uniting with the Ynambari.\r\n\r\nThe respective distances and populations of the villages of Caravaya\r\nare as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                Miles.

The valleys in which the Caravaya villages are\r\nsituated are separated from each other by spurs of the Andes, many of\r\nthem so wild and precipitous as to be quite inaccessible; and there\r\nis no means of passing from village to village, in many instances,\r\nwithout crossing the Andes to Crucero or Macusani, and descending again\r\nby another pass. For this reason Crucero, being in the most central\r\nposition, has been chosen as the site of the capital of the province,\r\nthough in a bleak and intensely cold region.\r\n\r\nThe geological formation of Caravaya is composed of non-fossiliferous\r\nschists, micaceous and slightly ferruginous, with veins of quartz. It\r\nis a portion of the extensive system of rocks which Mr. Forbes has\r\ngrouped together as belonging to the Silurian epoch, and which extends\r\nalmost continuously over an extent from north-west to south-east of\r\nmore than seven hundred miles, forming the mountain-chain of the\r\nEastern Andes, continuous from Cuzco, through Caravaya, to Bolivia.\r\nThese rocks throw off spurs along the eastern side of the main chain.\r\nOf this formation, too, are the loftiest mountain-peaks in South\r\nAmerica:--Illampu, or Sorata (24,812 feet), and Illimani (24,155\r\nfeet). Illampu, Mr. Forbes assures us, is fossiliferous up to its very\r\nsummit.[307]\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief account of the geography of Caravaya, and especially\r\nof the streams which combine to form the great river Purus, from the\r\nrivers of the Paucartambo valley on the extreme north-west, to the\r\nPablo-bamba on the frontier of Bolivia. The streams flowing from the\r\nEastern Andes to the north-west of the Paucartambo system combine to\r\nswell the Ucayali, while those to the south-east of the Pablo-bamba\r\nfall into the Beni, one of the chief tributaries of the Madeira. The\r\nintermediate streams are the sources of the unknown Purus, they are\r\nall more or less auriferous, they flow through forests abounding in\r\nvaluable products, and through countries of inexhaustible capabilities.\r\nYet the courses of very few of them have been explored to distances of\r\nseventy miles from their sources, and the main stream of the Purus, one\r\nof the principal affluents of the Amazon, may be said to be entirely\r\nunknown to geographers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nCARAVAYA.--THE VALLEY OF SANDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of April I left Crucero, on my way to the chinchona\r\nforests, rather late in the afternoon, accompanied by Mr. Weir the\r\ngardener, a young mestizo named Pablo Sevallos, and two cargo-mules.\r\nAfter a ride of three leagues along the bleak plain of Crucero, covered\r\nwith coarse _Stipa_ and stunted _Cacti_, we reached a little shepherd's\r\nhut, called Choclari-piña, at dusk. It was built of loose stones,\r\nwith a sheepskin hung across the doorway, but with no plaster or mud\r\nbetween the interstices of the stones, so that the piercingly cold wind\r\nblew right through the hut.[308] The poor Indian family were kind and\r\nhospitable, and gave us plenty of fresh milk. Next morning we continued\r\nthe journey along the same plain, with the snowy peaks of the Caravayan\r\nAndes on the left, and the glorious nevada of Ananea ahead, whence rise\r\nthe rivers of Azangaro flowing into lake Titicaca, and of Ynambari\r\nfinding its way to the Atlantic. A ride of twelve miles brought us to\r\na hut called Acco-kunka (neck of sand), at the foot of long ridges of\r\ndark-coloured cliffs, with huge boulders of rock scattered over the\r\nsides of the hills. A hard white frost covered the ground.\r\n\r\nAt Acco-kunka I met a red-faced man, about fifty years of age, who gave\r\nhis name as Don Manuel Martel. He said that he had been a colonel,\r\nand had suffered persecution for being faithful to his party; that\r\nhe had lost much money in the _cascarilla_ trade; and that he was\r\nnow making a clearing in the forests of Caravaya, for the purpose of\r\ngrowing sugar-cane. He talked about M. Hasskarl, the Dutch agent, who\r\nwas employed to obtain chinchona-plants in 1854, under his assumed name\r\nof Müller; said that he employed an agent named Clemente Henriquez to\r\ncollect the plants; and vowed that if he, or any one else, ever again\r\nattempted to take _cascarilla_ (chinchona) plants out of the country,\r\nhe would stir up the people to seize them and cut their feet off. There\r\nwas evidently some allusion to myself in his bluster; and I suspected,\r\nwhat afterwards proved to be the case, that Martel had, by some means,\r\ngot information respecting the objects of my journey, and was desirous\r\nof thwarting them. I had always carefully avoided any mention of\r\nthe subject since leaving Arequipa. Martel said he was going to buy\r\ngold-dust at Poti, so I soon got rid of him; and, passing an alpine\r\nlake, full of water-fowl, we began the descent into the golden valleys\r\nof Caravaya.\r\n\r\nOn the left a black cliff, perpendicular, and fully 2000 feet high,\r\nformed one side of the descent, and the space on its inner side was\r\noccupied by a small glacier, the only one I have ever seen in the\r\nAndes; whence descends, in a long waterfall, the source of the little\r\nriver Huaccuyo, which dashes down the ravine. For the first thousand\r\nfeet the vegetation continues to be of a lowly alpine character,\r\nconsisting of coarse grass and flowering herbs, chiefly _Compositæ_, of\r\nwhich there were several _Senecios_, generally with yellow flowers, a\r\ngentian with violet-coloured flowers, a _Bartsia_ with a yellow flower,\r\na little _Plantago_, and a _Ranunculus_. As we continued the descent,\r\nthe scenery increased in magnificence. The polished surfaces of the\r\nperpendicular cliffs glittered here and there with foaming torrents,\r\nsome like thin lines of thread, others broader and breaking over\r\nrocks, others seeming to burst out of the fleecy clouds; while jagged\r\nblack peaks, glittering with streaks of snow, pierced the mist which\r\nconcealed their bases. After descending for some leagues through this\r\nglorious scenery, the path at length crossed a ridge, and brought us to\r\nthe crest of the deep and narrow ravine of Cuyo-cuyo.\r\n\r\nThe path down the side of the gorge is very precipitous, through a\r\nsuccession of _andeneria_, or terraced gardens, some abandoned, and\r\nothers planted with ocas (_Oxalis tuberosa_), barley, and potatoes;\r\nthe upper tiers from six to eight feet wide, but gradually becoming\r\nbroader. Their walled sides are thickly clothed with Calceolarias,\r\nCelsias, Begonias, a large purple Solanum, and a profusion of ferns.\r\nBut it was not until reaching the little village in the bottom of the\r\nhollow that all the glories of the scene burst upon me. The river\r\nof Sandia, which takes its rise at the head of the ravine, flows by\r\nthe village of Cuyo-cuyo, bordered by ferns and wild flowers. It is\r\nfaced, near the village, with fern-covered masonry, and is crossed by\r\nseveral stone bridges of a single arch. Almost immediately on either\r\nside, the steep precipitous mountains, lined, at least a hundred deep,\r\nwith well-constructed _andeneria_, and faced with stone, rise up\r\nabruptly. In several places a cluster of cottages, built on one of the\r\nterraces, seemed almost to be hanging in the air. Above all the dark\r\nrocks shoot up into snowy peaks, which stood out against the blue sky.\r\nA most lovely scene, but very sad, for the great majority of those\r\ncarefully-constructed terraces, eternal monuments of the beneficence\r\nof the Incas, are now abandoned. The alcalde of Cuyo-cuyo received me\r\nmost hospitably. In the early morning numbers of lambs and young llamas\r\nwere playing about in the abandoned terraced gardens near the village.\r\nBesides Cuyo-cuyo, there are two small hamlets, called Muchucachi and\r\nSullanqui, and several scattered huts in the ravine, the population of\r\nwhich is estimated at 2000 souls.\r\n\r\nIn the morning of April 20th I rode down the beautiful gorge to the\r\nconfluence of the rivers of Sandia and Huaccuyo. After this junction\r\nthe stream becomes a roaring torrent, dashing over huge rocks, and\r\ndescending rapidly down the ravine towards Sandia. On both sides vast\r\nmasses of dark frowning mountains rear themselves up for thousands of\r\nfeet, and end in fantastically shaped peaks, some of them veiled by\r\nthin fleecy clouds. The vegetation rapidly increased in luxuriance\r\nwith the descent. At first there were low shrubs, such as _Baccharis\r\nodorata_, _Weinmannia fagaroides_, &c.; which gradually gave place to\r\ntrees and large bushes; while all the way from Cuyo-cuyo there were\r\nmasses of ferns of many kinds, Begonias, Calceolarias, Lupins, Salvias,\r\nand Celsias. Waterfalls streamed down the mountains in every direction:\r\nsome in a white sheet of continuous foam for hundreds of feet, finally\r\nseeming to plunge into huge beds of ferns and flowers; some like driven\r\nspray; and in one place a fall of water could be seen between two\r\npeaks, which seemed to fall into the clouds below.\r\n\r\nA most glorious and enchanting scene, allowing little time to think\r\nof the road, which was very bad, and in many places most perilous.\r\nIn its best parts it was like a steep back-attic staircase after an\r\nearthquake. Three leagues from Cuyo-cuyo is the confluence of the\r\ntorrent of Ñacorequi with the river of Sandia; and after this point\r\nmaize begins to be cultivated, where the craggy jutting cliffs permit,\r\nbetween the river and the mountains. The Indians live in eyrie-like\r\nhuts, perched at great heights, here and there, amongst the maize\r\nterraces. The village of Sandia is at a distance of fifteen miles from\r\nCuyo-cuyo, down this ravine, a dilapidated little place, with more than\r\nhalf the houses roofless and in ruins. It is built along the banks of\r\nthe river, and has a church in the _plaza_. The mountains rise up all\r\nround it, almost perpendicularly, forming a close amphitheatre; and in\r\ntwo places glittering cascades foam down from their very summits, into\r\nthe bushes on a level with the town.\r\n\r\nThe descent from the summit of the pass over the Caravayan Andes to\r\nSandia is very considerable, nearly 7000 feet in thirty miles, from an\r\narctic to a sub-tropical climate. The height of Crucero is 12,980 feet;\r\nof the pass 13,600; of Cuyo-cuyo 10,510; and of Sandia 6930 feet above\r\nthe sea.[309]\r\n\r\nThe four mountains closely hemming in the village of Sandia are mount\r\nChicanaco, which is beautified by a splendid cascade; mount Vianaco,\r\nwhich ends in two fine wooded peaks, between which a long slender\r\nthread of water descends into the foliage midway; mount Camparacani,\r\non the other side of the river, which rises up to a stupendous height,\r\nending in a jagged rocky peak; and mount Catasuyu, which completes\r\nthe circle, rising abruptly above the church. The name of Sandia\r\nis probably a corruption of the Spanish word _sandilla_, the first\r\nsettlers having mistaken the quantities of gourds which grow here for\r\n_sandillas_ or water-melons.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived in Sandia the governor was absent on his estate; the\r\ncura, my good friend Dr. Guaycochea, was getting in his maize-harvest\r\non his land near Cuzco; and the principal remaining inhabitants were\r\nthe Juez de Paz, Don Francisco Farfan, and one Don Manuel Mena, who\r\nwas drunk in bed when I arrived, but who afterwards received me very\r\nhospitably. These good people are, in manners and education, the\r\nroughest backwoodsmen, much too fond of aguardiente, and addicted to\r\nchewing coca to excess; but they are warm-hearted and neighbourly,\r\nwhile they display some energy in working the coffee and coca estates\r\nin the distant montaña, and in making roads, such as they are, from\r\nthese estates to Sandia. The richer people of Sandia all have more or\r\nless of Indian blood, and their wives and daughters are unable to\r\nspeak any language but Quichua; and thus they seem to be more closely\r\nunited in interests and feelings with the mass of the population than\r\nin any other part of Peru. The Indians of the district of Sandia are\r\ndivided into six _ayllus_ or tribes, besides the inhabitants of the\r\nvillages of Sandia, Cuyo-cuyo, and Patambuco. These _ayllus_ are\r\nestablished on the mountains around Sandia, living in scattered huts,\r\nsome cultivating maize and potatoes, others raising barley and alfalfa\r\nfor mules. The _ayllus_ are called Laqueque, about a league up the\r\nriver, on the right bank; Cuyo-cuyo (not the village), behind mount\r\nCamparacani; Oruro, on the heights below Cuyo-cuyo; Quiaca (not the\r\nvillage), near Oruro; Quenequi, about a league down the river; and\r\nApabuco, behind mount Catasuyu. The population of the parish of Sandia\r\nis about 7000; 4000 in Sandia and its six _ayllus_, 2000 in the village\r\nand ravine of Cuyo-cuyo, and 1000 in Patambuco. As many as 1000 souls\r\nfell victims to the dreadful pestilence of 1855, which raged over all\r\nparts of the Andes of Peru. Nearly every Indian family, besides land\r\nnear Sandia, owns a small farm of coca or coffee down in the montaña,\r\nto which men, women, and children go at harvest-time. As in all parts\r\nof the Andes, so in the Sandia ravine, I constantly found the Indians\r\ncivil, obliging, and respectful, always saluting with an \"Ave Maria\r\nTaytay!\" and a touch of the hat in passing. They are reserved and\r\nsilent, it is true, and superficial observers take this for stupidity.\r\nNever was there a greater mistake: their skill in carving and all\r\ncarpenter's work, in painting and embroidery, the exquisite fabrics\r\nthey weave from vicuña-wool, the really touching poetry of their\r\nlove-songs and _yaravis_, the traditional histories of their _ayllus_,\r\nwhich they preserve with religious care, surely disprove so false a\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nThe houses in Sandia are the merest barns, with mud-walls, and roofs\r\nwhich let the water in. All the family sleep together in a promiscuous\r\nway; pigs and fowls wandering over the floor at early dawn. The Juez\r\nde Paz, Francisco Farfan, administers justice in such a place as this,\r\nlounging on a sort of mud-platform at one end of the room, where\r\nhis bed is made up, while the culprit, and a crowd of alcaldes and\r\nspectators, stand before him. Every one chatters at the same time for\r\nabout ten minutes, and the prisoner is sent to the lock-up. The Jueces\r\nde Paz have to render periodical accounts of all their cases, attested\r\nby witnesses, to the Juez de Primera Instancia in the capital of the\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nWhile upon the subject of these local authorities, it will be well to\r\ngive an account of the powers placed in their hands by the Constitution\r\nof 1856, by which Peru is now governed; both because the measures then\r\nadopted will, I believe, have a lasting and beneficial effect on the\r\npeople, and because the persons so vested with power endeavoured to\r\ndisplay their patriotic zeal by throwing obstacles in my way. By this\r\nconstitution it was provided that in the capital of each department\r\nthere should be a _Junta Departmental_,[310] the members of which\r\nshould be elected in the same way and with the same qualifications as\r\nthose for the National Congress, to meet every year. These _Juntas_\r\nwere to deliberate and legislate for the advancement and material\r\nprogress of the departments, their decrees being null if contrary\r\nto any law of Congress. The evident objection to this measure is\r\nits tendency to split the country up into small communities with\r\nseparate interests, which has always proved to be most disastrous in\r\nthinly-peopled and half-civilized states. This view is taken in a very\r\nable article on the constitution, in a periodical published at Lima,\r\nwhere the _Juntas Departmentales_ are declared to be the initiation\r\nof a system of \"federation,\" the result of which has always been to\r\ndismember countries into so many small depopulated districts, as in\r\nMexico, Central America, New Granada, and the Argentine Republic,\r\nintroducing civil war, anarchy, and dissolution. The writer might now\r\nadd the dis-United States of North America also.[311]\r\n\r\nBut the institutions to which I before alluded, as having had a\r\nbeneficial effect, are the _Juntas Municipales_,[312] which were to be\r\nestablished in every district where materials existed to form them,\r\nand to have the regulation of the local funds and improvements. They\r\nwere to consist of the most influential citizens, elected by their\r\nfellow townsmen, and were to attend to local interests, have charge\r\nof the civic registers, take the census, &c. The same writer speaks\r\nof these municipalities in terms of unqualified praise, and says that\r\ntheir establishment is a positive good, without in any way promoting\r\na federation which would be ruinous to Peruvian nationality.[313]\r\nThey will give young men the opportunity of becoming acquainted with\r\npublic affairs, teach them habits of business, and gradually train them\r\nfor more important political duties. I look upon these institutions\r\nas one of the sources of hope for a brighter future for Peru; and as\r\nlong as they show activity, whether in a right or wrong direction,\r\nthey must be productive of good. The habit of taking an active part in\r\npublic affairs must be better than the torpor and indifference which\r\nformerly prevailed. I saw several signs of activity in these _Juntas\r\nMunicipales_ during my journey from Puno. At Lampa they were actively\r\nengaged in an endeavour to re-establish a manufactory of glazed tiles\r\nin that town; in Azangaro they were collecting subscriptions for a\r\nbridge across the river, to which one of their body had contributed\r\nhalf the required sum; and in Sandia they were drawing up a report on\r\nthe state of the roads, with an estimate of the sum required for their\r\nthorough repair and bridging. I was happy to be able to assist the\r\nSandia Municipality, by preparing a map for them, to illustrate their\r\nreport. The _Juntas Municipales_ of Sandia and Quiaca also, especially\r\nthe latter, took measures to prevent me from procuring a supply of\r\nchinchona-plants or seeds, influenced by motives which exposed their\r\nignorance of political economy, while it displayed their activity and\r\npatriotic zeal.\r\n\r\nIn Sandia the municipal body consists of the Alcalde Municipal, who\r\npresides, the Teniente Alcalde, the Syndic, two Judges of the Peace,\r\nthree Regidores, one of whom is Don Manuel Mena, and a Secretary.\r\n\r\nMy original plan had been to examine the chinchona forests during\r\nthis month, make as many meteorological and other observations as was\r\npossible, and perhaps send down a small collection of plants to the\r\ncoast; but to make the principal collection of plants and seeds in\r\nAugust, the month when the seeds of _C. Calisaya_ are ripe. I had not,\r\nhowever, been two days in Sandia before I discovered that Martel had\r\nalready written to several of the inhabitants, urging them to prevent\r\nme from taking chinchona plants or seeds out of the country, and to\r\nbring the matter before the _Junta Municipal_ of the district. I heard\r\nalso that he was busying himself in the same way in other villages\r\nbordering on the chinchona forests. My mission was becoming the talk\r\nof the whole country; and I at once saw that my only chance of success\r\nwas to commence the work of collecting plants without a moment's delay,\r\nand, if possible, anticipate any measures which might be taken to\r\nthwart my designs.\r\n\r\nIt was at Sandia that it became necessary to make final preparations\r\nfor a journey into the forests, for beyond this point the possibility\r\nof procuring supplies of any kind is very doubtful. I here laid in a\r\nstock of bread to last for about a month, which was toasted in the oven\r\nbelonging to the cura, the only one in the place, and which, together\r\nwith some chocolate and cheese, formed the provisions for myself and\r\nthe gardener. I then persuaded the judge to order the alcaldes of\r\nfour of the _ayllus_ to procure four Indians and two cargo-mules, the\r\nIndians to bring their own provisions with them, for which I advanced\r\nthem money. After considerable delays my little expedition was ready\r\nto start, consisting of myself, Mr. Weir the gardener, Pablo Sevallos\r\nthe mestizo, four Indians, and two mules. The supplies and provisions\r\nwere packed in six leathern bags, containing tea and sugar, chocolate,\r\ntoasted bread, cheese, candles, concentrated beef-tea, changes of\r\nclothes, instruments, powder and shot, besides a tent, an air-bed,\r\ngutta-percha robes, ponchos, a wood-knife and trowel, and maize and\r\nsalt meat for Pablo and the Indians. It took several days to complete\r\nthese preparations.\r\n\r\nThe climate of Sandia, at this time of the year, is exceedingly\r\nagreeable, the days being fine and clear until late in the afternoon,\r\nand not too hot. The prevailing wind blows up the ravine from the\r\nnorth-east, being the trade which comes across the vast forest-covered\r\nplains of the interior. It is this warm trade-wind which produces a\r\nmuch milder climate and more tropical vegetation in Cuyo-cuyo than in\r\nArequipa, though the former place is three thousand feet higher than\r\nthe latter. In Sandia, just after sunset, it feels rather chilly, and\r\nduring the middle of the day the sun is exceedingly hot. Light clouds\r\ngenerally hang about the highest peaks. The variety of most beautiful\r\nand graceful ferns on the walls of the houses, and near the banks of\r\nthe river, is endless.\r\n\r\nI had the satisfaction of seeing, in the house of Don Manuel Mena,\r\nbefore leaving Sandia, a bundle of small branches of the _ychu\r\ncascarilla_ (_C. Calisaya, var. β Josephiana_), with leaves and\r\nflowers, which had been collected as a tonic medicine for a little\r\ndaughter of my host.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of April, late in the afternoon, we left Sandia, and\r\nreached the _tambo_, or travellers' hut, called Cahuan-chaca, before\r\ndark. The road leads down the ravine, along narrow ledges overhanging\r\nthe river, which dashes furiously along, in most places between\r\nperpendicular cliffs. The path is very narrow and dangerous, but the\r\nscenery is superb, and the vegetation becomes richer and more tropical\r\nat every league of the descent.\r\n\r\nOne of the Indians traitorously fled on the first day, and my\r\nparty was thus reduced to three, who were barely able to carry the\r\nnecessary provisions. These three men proved faithful and willing\r\nfellow-labourers. Their names were Andres Vilca of the Oruro _Ayllu_,\r\nJulian Ccuri of Cuyo-cuyo, and Santos Quispi of Apabuco. They were\r\nfine-looking young fellows, wearing their hair in long plaits down\r\ntheir backs, coarse canvas trousers and shirts. They carry the cargos\r\nin large cloths tied in bundles, and placed in other cloths, which are\r\npassed over one shoulder and tied across the chest, called _ccepis_.\r\nThey stoop forward and step out at a great rate; and it is in this\r\nway that Indians carry their burdens along the roads, and women their\r\nchildren, throughout Peru. The _tambo_ of Cahuan-chaca is a shed, with\r\none side open, and we slept in company with three Indians and a woman\r\non their way to get in a coca-harvest in the Hatun-yunca, who were\r\nliving very well on salt mutton, eggs, and potatoes.\r\n\r\nThe river rushing down the valley winds along the small breadth of\r\nlevel land, striking first against the precipitous cliffs on one side,\r\nand then sweeping over to the other, so that a road in the bottom\r\nof the valley would require a bridge at almost every hundred yards.\r\nIt has, therefore, been necessary to excavate a path in the sides\r\nof the mountains, high above the river, which in some places has a\r\nbreadth of three feet only, with a perpendicular cliff on one side,\r\nand a precipice six or seven hundred feet deep on the other; while,\r\nin others, it zigzags down amongst loose stones, where one false step\r\nwould be immediate destruction. But the scenery continued to increase\r\nin beauty, and the cascades were really splendid:--\r\n\r\n  \"A land of streams! some, like a downward smoke,\r\n    Slow-dropping veils of thinnest lawn, did go;\r\n  And some thro' wavering lights and shadows broke,\r\n    Rolling a slumbrous sheet of foam below.\"\r\n\r\nThe river dashed noisily through the centre of the gorge, and the\r\nmasses of green on either side were toned down by many flowers in\r\nlarge patches, bright purple _Lasiandræ_, orange _Cassiæ_, and scarlet\r\n_Salviæ_. I also saw an _Indigofera_ growing in this part of the ravine.\r\n\r\nA mile from the hut of Cahuan-chaca is the confluence of the river\r\nHuascaray; and a league lower down is the little shed or tambo of\r\nCancallani. Here bamboos and tree-ferns first appear, and coca is\r\ncultivated in terraces which are fringed with coffee-plants, with\r\ntheir rich green foliage and crimson berries. I observed that the\r\nhuts in the middle of these patches of coca or maize had no doors,\r\nshowing the confidence of the inmates in the honesty of the numerous\r\npassers-by, who go to and fro between Sandia and the more distant coca\r\nestates.[314] I passed the estate of Chayllabamba, with terraces of\r\ncoca at least fifty deep, up the sides of the mountains; and Asalay, a\r\ncoffee estate, with groves of orange and chirimoya-trees, the extreme\r\npoint reached by M. Hasskarl, the Dutch collector, in 1854. At the\r\nconfluence of the rivers Asalay and Sandia perpendicular cliffs rise\r\nabruptly from the valley to a stupendous height on both sides, and\r\nthe path winds up in a serpentine slippery staircase, to creep along\r\nthe edge of the steep grassy slopes or _pajonales_, far above the\r\ntropical vegetation of the ravine. Winding along this path, we came to\r\nthe _tambo_ of Paccay-samana, on the grassy _pajonal_, the mountains\r\nrising up on the opposite side of the ravine only about sixty yards\r\ndistant; yet the river, in the bottom of the gorge, was many hundreds\r\nof feet below. There were thickets with masses of bright flowers in\r\nthe gullies, and glorious cascades shimmering in the sunlight on the\r\nopposite mountain-sides.\r\n\r\nIt was at this spot that we first encountered chinchona-plants. A\r\nnumber of young plants of _C. Calisaya_, _var. β Josephiana_, were\r\ngrowing by the side of the road, with their exquisite roseate flowers,\r\nand rich green leaves with crimson veins. The rock is a metamorphic\r\nslate, unfossiliferous, slightly micaceous, and ferruginous, with\r\nquartz occurring here and there: the soil a stiff brown loam. Above\r\nthe tambo there was a small thicket of gaultherias, called _ccarani_\r\nin Quichua, and Melastomaceæ with bright purple flowers (_Lasiandra\r\nfontanesiana_), in a shallow gully, surrounded by the rich broad-bladed\r\ngrass of the _pajonal_. Here there were some fine plants of the\r\nchinchona named by Dr. Weddell _C. Caravayensis_; and further on more\r\nplants of _C. Josephiana_, called _ychu cascarilla_ by the natives. The\r\nheight of this spot is 5420 feet above the sea. A tree-fern and many\r\n_Trichomanes_ were growing with the chinchonæ. Paccay-samana is sixteen\r\nmiles from Sandia.\r\n\r\nAnimal life did not appear to be very abundant. There were plenty of\r\nlarge doves, some ducks near the river, and a brilliant woodpecker. I\r\nalso saw great numbers of large swallow-tailed butterflies, purple with\r\nlight-blue spots on the upper wings; and others with white upper wings\r\nedged with jet black and rows of white spots, the lower wings orange.\r\n\r\nBeyond Paccay-samana there were several more plants of _C. Josephiana_,\r\nrising out of masses of maiden-hair and _Polypodia_. After following\r\nthe edge of the pajonal for about a mile, we descended by a precipitous\r\nzigzag path and crossed over the river Pulluma, at its confluence with\r\nthe Sandia. Here the road to the Hatun-yunca or Valle Grande branches\r\noff up the mountain of Ramas-pata, while our way continued down the\r\nravine. The scenery is here remarkably beautiful. Lofty mountains,\r\nwith their bright cascades, are clothed to their summits with rich\r\ngrass, while their gullies are filled with flowering trees and shrubs.\r\nHalf-way up, in many directions, the stone terraces of coca rise tier\r\nabove tier, fringed with ferns and begonias, and filled with the\r\ndelicate coloured green coca-branches, diversified occasionally by the\r\ndarker hues of the coffee. The ravine is filled with masses of purple\r\nMelastomaceæ, and the river is fringed with tree-ferns, plantains, and\r\nbamboos.\r\n\r\nThis purple Melastomacea (_Lasiandra fontanesiana_), called in Quichua\r\n_panti-panti_, in the brilliancy and abundance of its flowers,\r\nbears the same relation to this part of the Peruvian Andes as the\r\nrhododendron does to the Himalayas. The effect in masses is much the\r\nsame, but the _Lasiandra_ appears to me to be a more graceful and\r\ndelicate tree, with a more beautiful flower. In this ravine we have the\r\nshrub chinchonæ on the high grassy slopes, perhaps the finest coffee\r\nin the world near the banks of the river, and a little galium by the\r\nroad-side--all chinchonaceous plants.\r\n\r\nAt noon on April 26th we rested in the tambo of Ypara, in the centre\r\nof coca cultivation, and in the afternoon, crossing the river by a\r\nwooden bridge, we had to travel along the skirts of the mountains, at\r\na considerable height, in the region of the _pajonales_. No gullies or\r\nlarge cascades cut up the face of these mountains, which were entirely\r\nexposed to the full glare of the sun, and here, though there was a\r\nprofusion of purple Melastomaceæ in some of the shallow indentations,\r\nthere were no chinchonæ. Towards evening we came to a lofty spur of the\r\nmountain, called Estanqui, at a great height above the ravine, whence\r\nthere was a most extensive view. To the left was the valley of Sandia,\r\nwith little coca-farms nestling in all the sheltered gullies; and I\r\ncould just make out the boys and girls far far below, like specks, busy\r\nwith the coca-leaves in the drying-yards. In front there was a distant\r\nview of the hills in the direction of San Juan del Oro, covered with\r\nvirgin forest; while at our feet, and a thousand feet below us, was the\r\nconfluence of the rivers Sandia, Llaypuni, and Huari-huari, which unite\r\nto form the great river Ynambari.\r\n\r\nIt was my intention, after marking down all the eligible plants of\r\nthe shrubby _Calisaya_, to be taken up on our return, to make for the\r\nforest-covered valley of Tambopata, which is full of chinchona-trees;\r\nand I therefore left the ravine of the Sandia river at this point,\r\nand, by a rapid descent, went down from the grassy uplands to a region\r\nof tropical forest, full of palms and tree-ferns. We thus reached the\r\nbanks of the Huari-huari. This river flows through a deep and very\r\nnarrow ravine, lined with forest, for about 500 feet, above which rise\r\ngrassy mountains to an immense height. Though only 30 feet across, and\r\nconfined by dark polished rocks, the Huari-huari is very deep, and\r\ndecidedly a more important stream than the Sandia, at their junction.\r\n\r\nWe established ourselves under a rock, where there was no room to\r\npitch the tent, and thus our first night of camping out commenced, for\r\npreviously we had slept in the road-side _tambos_. The Indians carried\r\nlittle earthen pots for cooking, in their _ccepis_, and got up a fire\r\nof dry sticks with great rapidity. I had a delicious bath in the river,\r\nwhere the tall forest trees overshadowed the water on either side. At\r\nnight the moon streamed its floods of light over the forest, and the\r\nbrilliant sparks from myriads of fire-flies shone from the trees in\r\nevery direction up the side of the opposite mountain; but in the early\r\nmorning the sky clouded over, and a heavy drizzling rain began to fall,\r\nwhich prevented sleep, and made us wish for day.\r\n\r\nFrom this encampment our way led up the precipitous sides of the\r\nmountain, to the grassy _pajonales_ which divide the valleys of Sandia\r\nand Tambopata; but I will here halt awhile to give a brief account of\r\nthe cultivation of that plant, of which we had lately seen so much, and\r\nwhich enabled me to ascend the mighty passes of the Andes on foot with\r\nease and comfort--the strength-giving, invigorating coca.\r\n\r\nA general geographical description of all this country has been given\r\nin the preceding chapter.\r\n\r\nDuring my stay at Sandia the indications of the thermometer were as\r\nfollows, between the 20th and 25th of April:--\r\n\r\n  Mean temperature                63-1/5°\r\n  Minimum temperature at night    50-1/2\r\n  Highest observed                65\r\n  Lowest                          47\r\n  Range                           18\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nCOCA-CULTIVATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE coca-leaf is the great source of comfort and enjoyment to the\r\nPeruvian Indian; it is to him what betel is to the Hindoo, kava to\r\nthe South Sea Islander, and tobacco to the rest of mankind; but its\r\nuse produces invigorating effects which are not possessed by the\r\nother stimulants. From the most ancient times the Peruvians have\r\nused this beloved leaf, and they still look upon it with feelings of\r\nsuperstitious veneration. In the time of the Incas it was sacrificed\r\nto the Sun, the Huillac Umu or high priest chewing the leaf during the\r\nceremony; and, before the arrival of the Spaniards, it was used, as the\r\ncacao in Mexico, instead of money. After the conquest, although its\r\nvirtues were extolled by the Inca Garcilasso de la Vega,[315] and by\r\nthe Jesuit Acosta,[316] some fanatics proposed to proscribe its use,\r\nand to root up the plants, because they had been used in the ancient\r\nsuperstitions, and because its cultivation took away the Indians from\r\nother work. The second council of Lima, consisting of bishops from all\r\nparts of South America, condemned the use of coca in 1569 because it\r\nwas a \"useless and pernicious leaf, and on account of the belief stated\r\nto be entertained by the Indians that the habit of chewing coca gave\r\nthem strength, which is an illusion of the devil.\"[317]\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the strength the coca gives to those who chew it,\r\nGarcilasso do la Vega relates the following anecdote. \"I remember a\r\nstory which I heard in my native land of Peru, of a gentleman of rank\r\nand honour, named Rodrigo Pantoja, who, travelling from Cuzco to Rimac\r\n(Lima), met a poor Spaniard (for there are poor people there as well\r\nas here) who was going on foot, with a little girl aged two years on\r\nhis back. The man was known to Pantoja, and they thus conversed. 'Why\r\ndo you go laden thus?' said the knight. The poor man answered that he\r\nwas unable to hire an Indian to carry the child, and for that reason he\r\ncarried it himself. While he spoke Pantoja looked in his mouth, and saw\r\nthat it was full of coca; and, as the Spaniards abominate all that the\r\nIndians eat and drink, as though it savoured of idolatry, particularly\r\nthe chewing of coca, which seems to them a low and vile habit, he said,\r\n'It may be as you say, but why do you eat coca like an Indian, a thing\r\nso hateful to Spaniards?' The man answered, 'In truth, my lord, I\r\ndetest it as much as any one, but necessity obliges me to imitate the\r\nIndians, and keep coca in my mouth; for I would have you to know that,\r\nif I did not do so, I could not carry this burden; while the coca gives\r\nme sufficient strength to endure the fatigue.' Pantoja was astonished\r\nto hear this, and told the story wherever he went; and from that time\r\ncredit was giving to the Indians for using coca from necessity, and not\r\nfrom vicious gluttony.\"\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Government interfered with the cultivation from more\r\nworthy motives, and _mitas_ of Indians, for the purpose of collecting\r\ncoca-leaves, were forbidden in 1569, owing to the reputed unhealthiness\r\nof the valleys.[318] Finally Don Francisco Toledo, viceroy of Peru,\r\npermitted the cultivation with voluntary labour, on condition that the\r\nIndians were well paid, and that care was taken of their healths. This\r\nmost prolific of Peruvian legislators issued no less than seventy\r\n_ordenanzas_ on this subject alone, between the years 1570 and 1574.\r\nCoca has always been one of the most valuable articles of commerce in\r\nPeru, and it is used by about 8,000,000 of the human race.\r\n\r\nThe coca-plant (_Erythoxylon coca_)[319] is cultivated between 5000\r\nand 6000 feet above the level of the sea, in the warm valleys of the\r\neastern slopes of the Andes, where almost the only variation of climate\r\nis from wet to dry, where frost is unknown, and where it rains more or\r\nless every month in the year. It is a shrub from four to six feet high,\r\nwith lichens, called _lacco_ in Quichua, usually growing on the older\r\ntrunks. The branches are straight and alternate; leaves alternate and\r\nentire, in form and size like tea-leaves; flowers solitary with a small\r\nyellowish-white corolla in five petals, ten filaments the length of the\r\ncorolla, anthers heart-shaped, and three pistils.\r\n\r\nSowing is commenced in December and January, when the rains begin,\r\nwhich continue until April. The seeds are spread on the surface of\r\nthe soil in a small nursery or raising-ground called _almaciga_, over\r\nwhich there is generally a thatch roof (_huasichi_). At the end of\r\nabout a fortnight they come up; the young plants being continually\r\nwatered, and protected from the sun by the _huasichi_. The following\r\nyear they are transplanted to a soil specially prepared by thorough\r\nweeding, and breaking up the clods very fine by hand; often in terraces\r\nonly affording room for a single row of plants, up the sides of the\r\nmountains, which are kept up by small stone walls. The plants are\r\ngenerally placed in square holes called _aspi_, a foot deep, with\r\nstones on the sides to prevent the earth from falling in. Three or\r\nfour are planted in each hole, and grow up together. In Caravaya and\r\nBolivia the soil in which the coca grows is composed of a blackish\r\nclay, formed from the decomposition of the schists, which form the\r\nprincipal geological features of the mountains. On level ground the\r\nplants are placed in furrows called _uachos_, separated by little walls\r\nof earth _umachas_, at the foot of each of which a row of plants is\r\nplaced; but this is a modern innovation, the terrace cultivation being\r\nthe most ancient. At the end of eighteen months the plants yield their\r\nfirst harvest, and continue to yield for upwards of forty years. The\r\nfirst harvest is called _quita calzon_, and the leaves are then picked\r\nvery carefully, one by one, to avoid disturbing the roots of the young\r\ntender plants. The following harvests are called _mitta_ (\"time\" or\r\n\"season\"), and take place three times and even four times in the year.\r\nThe most abundant harvest takes place in March, immediately after the\r\nrains; the worst at the end of June, called the _mitta de San Juan_.\r\nThe third, called _mitta de Santos_, is in October or November. With\r\nplenty of watering, forty days suffice to cover the plants with leaves\r\nafresh. It is necessary to weed the ground very carefully, especially\r\nwhile the plants are young, and the harvest is gathered by women and\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nThe green leaves, called _matu_, are deposited in a piece of cloth\r\nwhich each picker carries, and are then spread out in the drying-yard,\r\ncalled _matu-cancha_, and carefully dried in the sun. The dried leaf\r\nis called _coca_. The drying-yard is formed of slate-flags, called\r\n_pizarra_; and, when the leaves are thoroughly dry, they are sewn up\r\nin _cestos_ or sacks made of banana-leaves, of twenty pounds each,\r\nstrengthened by an exterior covering of _bayeta_ or cloth.[320] They\r\nare also packed in _tambores_ of fifty pounds each, pressed tightly\r\ndown. Dr. Poeppig reckoned the profits of a coca-farm to be forty-five\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nThe harvest is greatest in a hot moist situation; but the leaf\r\ngenerally considered the best flavoured by consumers, grows in drier\r\nparts, on the sides of hills. The greatest care is required in the\r\ndrying; for too much sun causes the leaves to dry up and lose their\r\nflavour, while, if packed up moist, they become fetid. They are\r\ngenerally exposed to the sun in thin layers.\r\n\r\nAcosta says that in his time the trade in coca at Potosi was worth\r\n500,000 dollars annually; and that in 1583 the Indians consumed\r\n100,000 _cestos_ of coca, worth 2-1/2 dollars each in Cuzco, and 4\r\ndollars in Potosi. In 1591[321] an excise of 5 per cent. was imposed\r\non coca; and in the years 1746 and 1750 this duty yielded 800 and\r\n500 dollars respectively, from Caravaya alone. Between 1785 and 1795\r\nthe coca traffic was calculated at 1,207,430 dollars in the Peruvian\r\nviceroyalty; and, including that of Buenos Ayres, 2,641,487 dollars.\r\n\r\nIn the district of Sandia, in Caravaya, there are two kinds of coca,\r\nthat of Ypara and that of Hatun-yunca, which has a larger leaf. The\r\nyield is 45,000 cestos a year. In the yungus of La Paz, in Bolivia,\r\nthe yield is about 400,000 cestos. The coca-trade is a government\r\nmonopoly in Bolivia, the state reserving the right of purchasing from\r\nthe grower, and reselling to the consumer. This right is generally\r\nfarmed out to the highest bidder. In 1850 the coca-duty yielded 200,000\r\ndollars to the Bolivian revenue.\r\n\r\nThe approximate annual produce of coca in Peru is about 15,000,000\r\nlbs.,[322] the average yield being about 800 lbs. an acre. More than\r\n10,000,000 lbs. are produced annually in Bolivia, according to Dr.\r\nBooth of La Paz; so that the annual yield of coca throughout South\r\nAmerica, including Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Pasto, may be estimated\r\nat more than 30,000,000 lbs. At Tacna the _tambor_ of 50 lbs. is\r\nworth 9 to 12 dollars, the fluctuations in price being caused by the\r\nperishable nature of the article, which cannot be kept in stock for\r\nany length of time. The average duration of coca in a sound state, on\r\nthe coast, is about five months, after which time it is said to lose\r\nflavour, and is rejected by the Indians as worthless.\r\n\r\nThe reliance on the extraordinary virtues of the coca-leaf, amongst the\r\nPeruvian Indians, is so strong, that, in the Huanuco province, they\r\nbelieve that, if a dying man can taste a leaf placed on his tongue, it\r\nis a sure sign of his future happiness.[323]\r\n\r\nNo Indian is without his _chuspa_ or coca-bag, made of llama-cloth,\r\ndyed red and blue in patterns, with woollen tassels hanging from it.\r\nHe carries it over one shoulder, suspended at his side; and, in taking\r\ncoca, he sits down, puts his _chuspa_ before him, and places the leaves\r\nin his mouth one by one, chewing and turning them till he forms a ball.\r\nHe then applies a small quantity of carbonate of potash, prepared\r\nby burning the stalk of the quinoa-plant, and mixing the ashes with\r\nlime and water; thus forming cakes called _llipta_, which are dried\r\nfor use, and also kept in the _chuspa_.[324] This operation is called\r\n_acullicar_ in Bolivia and Southern Peru, and _chacchar_ in the North.\r\nThey usually perform it three times in a day's work, and every Indian\r\nconsumes two or three ounces of coca daily.\r\n\r\nIn the mines of the cold region of the Andes the Indians derive great\r\nenjoyment from the use of coca; the running _chasqui_, or messenger,\r\nin his long journeys over the mountains and deserts, and the shepherd\r\nwatching his flock on the lofty plains, has no other nourishment than\r\nis afforded by his _chuspa_ of coca, and a little maize. The smell of\r\nthe leaf is agreeable and aromatic, and when chewed it gives out a\r\ngrateful fragrance, accompanied by a slight irritation, which excites\r\nthe saliva. Its properties are to enable a greater amount of fatigue\r\nto be borne with less nourishment, and to prevent the occurrence of\r\ndifficulty of respiration in ascending steep mountain-sides. Tea\r\nmade from the leaves has much the taste of green tea, and, if taken\r\nat night, is much more effectual in keeping people awake. Applied\r\nexternally coca moderates the rheumatic pains caused by cold, and cures\r\nheadaches. When used to excess it is, like everything else, prejudicial\r\nto the health, yet, of all the narcotics used by man, coca is the least\r\ninjurious, and the most soothing and invigorating.\r\n\r\nThe active principle of the coca-leaf has, a few years ago, been\r\nseparated by Dr. Niemann, and called _cocaine_. Pure _cocaine_\r\ncrystallizes with difficulty, is but slightly soluble in water, but is\r\neasily dissolved in alcohol, and still more easily in ether.[325]\r\n\r\nI chewed coca, not constantly, but very frequently, from the day of my\r\ndeparture from Sandia, and, besides the agreeable soothing feeling it\r\nproduced, I found that I could endure long abstinence from food with\r\nless inconvenience than I should otherwise have felt, and it enabled\r\nme to ascend precipitous mountain-sides with a feeling of lightness\r\nand elasticity, and without losing breath. This latter quality ought\r\nto recommend its use to members of the Alpine Club, and to walking\r\ntourists in general, though the sea voyage would probably cause the\r\nleaves to lose much of their virtue. To the Peruvian Indian, however,\r\nwho can procure it within a few weeks of its being picked, the coca is\r\na solace which is easily procured, which affords great enjoyment, and\r\nwhich has a most beneficial effect.[326]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nCARAVAYA.\r\n\r\nChinchona forests of Tambopata.\r\n\r\n\r\nON the morning of April 27th we crossed a rude bridge over the\r\nHuari-huari, and began to make our way up the face of the steep\r\nmountain on the other side, first through a thick forest, and then up\r\ninto the grassy highlands, until, after several halts, we at length\r\nreached the summit of the ridge, though a mountain-peak still rose\r\nup in our rear. From this point there was a most extensive panoramic\r\nview. A sea of ridges rose one behind the other, with stupendous snowy\r\npeaks in the background, and, more than a thousand feet below, the\r\nrivers of Sandia and Huari-huari, reduced to mere glittering threads,\r\ncould be seen winding through the tortuous ravines. We had now reached\r\nthe _pajonales_, and were on a ridge or back-bone between the rivers\r\nof Laccani and San Lorenzo, two tributaries of the Huari-huari;\r\na grass-covered and comparatively cold region, interspersed with\r\nthickets, forming the crest of the tropical forests which line the\r\nsides of the ravines through which the rivers wind, far below.\r\n\r\nWhen there is sunshine, these _pajonales_ form a very pleasant\r\nlandscape: the broad expanse of grass, dotted over with a graceful\r\nmilk-white flower called _sayri-sayri_, is intersected by dense\r\nthickets, some in the gullies and watercourses, and others in clumps,\r\nlike those in an English park, the palms and tree-ferns raising their\r\ngraceful heads above the rest of the trees. Here and there a black pool\r\nof sweet water is met with at the edge of the thicket, with chinchona\r\nand _huaturu_-trees drooping over it. Everywhere there is an abrupt\r\nboundary to the foreground in the profound forest-covered ravines, with\r\nsplendid views of mountain ranges in the distance.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation of the thickets in these _pajonales_ consists of\r\n_palms_, _tree-ferns_, _Melastomaceæ_ (_Lasiandra fontanesiana_) with\r\nbright showy flowers, exceedingly pretty _Ericaceæ_ (_Gaultheriæ_),\r\n_Vacciniæ_, the _huaturu_ or incense-tree in great quantities, and\r\n_Chinchonæ_, chiefly consisting of _C. Caravayensis_ (Wedd.), with a\r\nfew plants of _Calisaya Josephiana_, but the latter are much more rare\r\nhere than in the neighbourhood of Paccay-samana. The _C. Caravayensis_,\r\na worthless species, has panicles of beautiful deep roseate flowers,\r\nlarge coarse hairy capsules, and lanceolate leaves, above smooth with\r\npurple veins, and hairy on the under side. It can probably bear greater\r\ncold than any other chinchona.[327]\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was passed in searching for plants of the shrubby\r\n_Calisaya_, but with little success. During our examination of the\r\nthickets we found a single specimen, evidently belonging to the\r\n_Calisaya_ species, but in the form of a tree, and not of a shrub.\r\nIts height was eighteen feet six inches; its girth, two feet from the\r\nground, eight and a half inches; and the position in which it was\r\ngrowing was 5680 feet above the level of the sea. I was uncertain\r\nwhether it belonged to the tree variety (_Calisaya vera_, Wedd.), or\r\nto the shrub (_Calisaga Josephiana_); for Dr. Weddell only gives the\r\nheight of the latter at eight or ten feet.\r\n\r\nNear the banks of one of the black pools, overhung by spreading\r\nbranches, we found a shed, a roof of coarse grass raised on four sticks\r\nfour and a half feet high, and here we encamped for the night. It had\r\nbeen made by some party of incense-collectors from Bolivia, who wander\r\nthrough these wilds. Towards sunset it began to pour with rain, and\r\ncontinued through the night.\r\n\r\nFrom this point to the Tambopata valley the road was unknown to my\r\nIndians, and had not been traversed since the time of the bark-trade,\r\nwhich came to an end fifteen years ago. It was supposed that any path\r\nwhich might once have existed would be entirely choked up by the\r\nforest, and I therefore started early in the morning, with Andres\r\nVilca, to reconnoitre. The backbone of the ridge along which we\r\ntravelled was not level, but up and down like a saw, and very rough\r\nwork. After walking for a league the ridge ended where a transverse\r\nrange of hills, at a lower elevation, connects the mountains on the\r\nfurther sides of the rivers of San Lorenzo and Laccani, and, closing\r\nup the ravines, contains their sources. This range, at right angles\r\nwith the one over which we had journeyed, is called the _Marun-kunka_,\r\nand is covered with dense forests. It was necessary to force our way\r\nthrough this formidable obstruction, and we plunged into it at once.\r\nOur progress was vigorously opposed by closely matted fallen bamboos\r\nfor the first few hundred yards, and afterwards we followed the course\r\nof a torrent, deeply cut in the rock, and forming a passage four to\r\nsix feet deep, and about three feet across, with masses of ferns\r\nand the roots of enormous forest-trees interlacing across overhead,\r\nand two feet of exceedingly tenacious yellow mud underfoot. In many\r\nplaces it was almost dark at midday, while in others the rays of the\r\nsun succeeded in forcing their way through the ferns, and throwing\r\na pale light across the otherwise gloomy passage. It was a weird\r\nunearthly scene. After several hours of very laborious travelling we\r\nat length forced our way across the Marun-kunka, and came out upon\r\nanother _pajonal_, on the eastern side, whence there was a grand view\r\nof the forest scenery towards Tambopata, and the snowy peaks of the\r\ncordillera above Quiaca and Sina to the right.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was again devoted to searching for plants of _Calisaya\r\nJosephiana_ in the thickets; where the _C. Caravayensis_ was very\r\nplentiful, together with several plants of the shrubby _Calisaya_,\r\nand four or five trees of the normal tree _Calisaya_, from 20 to 30\r\nfeet high. The elevation of this place was 5600 feet above the sea.\r\nLater in the day the journey was continued over a most difficult\r\ncountry, sometimes over grassy _pajonales_, and at others painfully\r\nstruggling through forests like those on the Marun-kunka. In one of\r\nthese forests I came upon a _Calisaya_-tree, 38 feet high, and 1 foot\r\n3 inches in girth at a distance of 3 feet from the ground, which was\r\nseveral feet deep in dead leaves, chiefly the smooth leathery leaf of\r\nthe _huaturu_-tree. At length we commenced the descent into the valley\r\nof Tambopata, 1200 feet down slippery rocks and grass, then through a\r\nbelt of forest, until we suddenly emerged on an open space on the banks\r\nof the large rapid river, where there was a bamboo hut. A little coca\r\nand sugar-cane was planted, but the occupant was absent. With touching\r\nconfidence he had left his door open, so my Indians established\r\nthemselves comfortably, while Weir and I pitched the tent.\r\n\r\nThe river of Tambopata, descending from the farm of Saqui near the\r\nfrontier of Bolivia, here flows in a northerly direction. Up the stream\r\nI could see a few little clearings, but looking down nothing appeared\r\nbut the virgin forest. A most magnificent range of mountains, with a\r\nfine growth of forest trees, rises up on either side, and the rapid\r\nswollen river rushed through the centre of the ravine. The rock of all\r\nthe ranges of hills between the Huari-huari and Tambopata rivers is\r\na yellow clay-slate, with masses of white quartz cropping out on the\r\n_pajonales_.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning we continued our journey down the valley, through\r\na forest of grand timber, passing the little hut of Tambopata which\r\nDr. Weddell had mentioned to me as having been the great rendezvous\r\nfor _cascarilleros_ or chinchona-bark collectors, at the time of his\r\nvisit. After wading across the rapid little river of Llami-llami, which\r\nenters the Tambopata on the left bank, we came to a small clearing,\r\nplanted with sugar-cane, the property of a very energetic and obliging\r\nold Bolivian, named Don Juan de la Cruz Gironda. He was living in\r\na shed, open on two sides, and with a young son, and two or three\r\nIndians, was actively clearing, planting sugar-cane, and making rum in\r\nan extemporized distillery of his own manufacture. This little farm was\r\nthe extreme outpost of civilisation in this direction, and had only\r\nbeen commenced since December 1859.\r\n\r\nGironda was cultivating sugar-cane, maize, and edible roots; and, at\r\nthe time of my visit, he was just commencing his _michca_, or small\r\nsowing of maize. His people were driving holes in the ground with long\r\npoles, about a foot deep, into which they drop four to six grains, and\r\ncover over. The holes are four feet apart, for here the maize grows\r\nto an immense height. The agricultural tools were of a most primitive\r\nkind. The ground is first broken and cleared with a bit of old iron,\r\nfastened, at an acute angle, on a short handle. It is further broken\r\nup by an attempt at a spade, an oblong piece of iron, bent at one end\r\nround a long pole. The weeds and brushwood are cleared away by an\r\ninstrument like the first, only turned a different way, both being\r\nsecured to their handles by leathern thongs. They reap with the blade\r\nof an old knife, and where the clods require to be broken up very\r\nfine, as in coca plantations, it is done by hand. The only use that\r\nGironda puts his small supply of sugar-cane to, as yet, is making\r\nspirits and a small quantity of treacle. The cane is expressed by a\r\nvery primitive mill of three upright rollers of hard wood, worked\r\nby a single capstan-bar and a mule, the juice flowing into a gutter,\r\nand running thence, through a bamboo, into a large jar. The juice is\r\nthen placed in two long canoes, hollow trunks of trees, where it is\r\nallowed to ferment. In about eight days the fermentation is over, and\r\nit is ready for distilling. This sugar-beer is called _huarapu_, and\r\nis rather good. The juice is then poured into a large jar, over an\r\noven, and above the mouth of this jar he places the broken side of\r\nanother smaller one, covering the joining round with mud. From the\r\nmouth of the second jar a bamboo is led through a large canoe to the\r\nmouth of a third jar. The fire is lighted in the oven, the canoe is\r\nfilled with cold water to condense the vapour as it comes up through\r\nthe bamboo, and the work of distilling begins; the clear colourless\r\nrum soon commencing to flow out of the bamboo into the receiving-jar.\r\nThe sugar-cane is of the purplish-brown kind, which is said to ripen\r\nquickest.\r\n\r\nGironda also raises a few edible roots, such as _yucas_ (_Jatophra\r\nmanihot_), _aracachas_[328] (_Conium maculatum_), _camotes_ or sweet\r\npotatoes, and _ocas_. He gave me the following information respecting\r\nthe climate and seasons in the valley of Tambopata, which is worthy of\r\nattention, as this is the very centre of the _C. Calisaya_ region.\r\n\r\n January.--Incessant rain, with damp heat day and night. Sun never\r\n seen. Fruits ripen.\r\n\r\n February.--Incessant rain and very hot. Sun never seen. A coca harvest.\r\n\r\n March.--Less rain, hot days and nights, little sun. Bananas yield most\r\n during the rainy season.\r\n\r\n April.--Less rain; hot, humid nights, and little sun in the daytime.\r\n\r\n May.--A showery month, but little heavy rain. This is the month for\r\n planting coca and sugar-cane, and what is called the _michca_, or\r\n small sowing of maize, as well as yucas, aracachas, camotes, and other\r\n edible roots. Coffee-harvest begins.\r\n\r\n June.--A dry hot month. Much sun and little rain. Coca-harvest early\r\n in the month. Oranges and paccays ripen. Cool nights, but a fierce\r\n heat during the day.\r\n\r\n July.--The hottest and driest month, but with cool nights. Very few\r\n showers. Time for sowing gourds, pumpkins, and water-melons.\r\n\r\n August.--Generally dry. Trees begin to bud. A month for planting.\r\n\r\n September.--Rains begin. Time for blossoming of many trees.\r\n Coca-harvest.\r\n\r\n October.--Rains increasing. Maize-harvest, and time for the \"sembra\r\n grande,\" or great sowing of maize.\r\n\r\n November.--Heavy rains. A coca-harvest.\r\n\r\n December.--Heavy rains. Pumpkins ripen.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the valley of Tambopata consist of Gironda, his two\r\nlittle boys, one Victorio Jovi, Villalba, and the _cascarillero_ named\r\nMartinez. Another _cascarillero_, named Ximenes, has lately died. They\r\nlive with their families at a place called Huaccay-churu, about half a\r\nmile up the Llami-llami river, where there are a few huts, and a small\r\nclearing. Gironda's little farm is the last inhabited spot; beyond\r\nis the illimitable virgin forest, stretching away for hundreds, nay\r\nthousands of miles, to the shores of the Atlantic. This forest has not\r\nbeen traversed since 1847, when the bark trade ceased, and it is quite\r\nclosed up.\r\n\r\nBy the desertion of one of my Indians on the day we left Sandia, the\r\nother three and Pablo Sevallos were barely able to carry the provisions\r\nand other necessaries, so that, on reaching Gironda's clearing, which\r\nis called Lenco-huayccu,[329] I found that I had only sufficient food\r\nto last for six days. Gironda himself was little better off, and was\r\nliving on roots, and _chuñus_ or potatoes preserved by being frozen in\r\nthe loftiest parts of the Andes. I determined, however, to penetrate\r\ninto the forest, in search of chinchona-plants, for six days, and to\r\ntrust to Gironda's kindness to supply me with provisions to enable me\r\nto return to Sandia.\r\n\r\nI was so fortunate as to secure the services of Mariano Martinez, an\r\nexperienced _cascarillero_, who had acted as guide to Dr. Weddell,\r\non the occasion of his visit to the valley of Tambopata in 1846.\r\nHe was thoroughly acquainted with all the different species of\r\nchinchona-trees, and, reared from a child in these forest solitudes, he\r\nwas a most excellent and expert woodman, intelligent, sober, active,\r\nand obliging.\r\n\r\nOn May 1st we prepared to enter the dense entangled forest, where\r\nno European had been before, and no human being for upwards of\r\nthirteen years, except the Collahuayas and incense-collectors. Our\r\nparty consisted of seven: the three Indians, Weir, Pablo, Martinez,\r\nand myself. The Indians, each with their _chuspas_ of coca, and a\r\n_chumpi_ or belt round their waists, carried the _ccepis_ or bundles of\r\nprovisions; Pablo bore the tent; and we were all armed with _machetes_,\r\nor wood-knives, to clear the way. My people were all dressed in coarse\r\ncotton cloth, and I wore a leathern hat, red woollen shirt, fustian\r\ntrousers, and the indispensable _polccos_, or shoes made of _bayeta_ or\r\nfelt, always used in these forests. We were all mustered and ready to\r\nstart on the verge of Gironda's clearing, which is surrounded by tall\r\nforest trees, with the river rushing noisily past, and the opposite\r\nmountains covered to their summits with fine timber, when half a\r\ndozen pale-faced men emerged from the tangled thicket in our front.\r\nThey looked wan and cadaverous like men risen from the dead, and worn\r\nout by long watching and fatigue. They turned out to be Collahuayas,\r\ncollectors of drugs and incense, who penetrate far into the forests to\r\nobtain their wares, and come forth, as we then saw them, looking pale\r\nand haggard.\r\n\r\nThese Collahuayas, called also Chirihuanos on the coast of Peru,\r\nYungeños, and Charasanis, are a very peculiar race. They come from\r\nthree villages in the forest-covered ravines of the Bolivian province\r\nof Larecaja, called Charasani, Consata, and Quirbe; and their\r\nknowledge of the virtues of herbs has been handed down from father to\r\nson from time immemorial. They traverse the forests of Bolivia and\r\nCaravaya collecting their drugs; and then set out as professors of\r\nthe healing art, to exercise their calling in all parts of America,\r\nfrequently being two and three years away from their homes, on these\r\nexcursions. With their wallets of drugs on their backs, and dressed\r\nin black breeches, a red poncho, and broad-brimmed hat, they walk in\r\na direct line from village to village, exercising their calling, and\r\npenetrating as far as Quito and Bogota in one direction, and to the\r\nextreme limits of the Argentine Republic in the other. Their ancestors\r\ndid the same in the time of the Incas, and Garcilasso de la Vega gives\r\nsome account of the medical treatment adopted by the ancient Peruvian\r\nphysicians. They were in the habit of letting blood and purging, they\r\nadministered the powdered leaf of the _sayri_ (tobacco) for headaches,\r\n_mulli_ (_Schinus molle_) for wounds, and a host of other simple herbs\r\nfor other ailments. Both Garcilasso[330] and Acosta[331] mention their\r\nknowledge of the virtues of sarsaparilla, yet it is remarkable that the\r\nCollahuayas should never have discovered the febrifugal qualities of\r\nchinchona bark.\r\n\r\nWe saluted these hard-working physicians, and then entered the forest\r\nfrom which they had just emerged. A short walk brought us to the river\r\nChalluma,[332] a tributary of the Tambopata, which we waded across.\r\nMartinez told me that this was the extreme point reached by Dr.\r\nWeddell, and that he came here to see a tree of _C. micrantha_ growing.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Challuma there is no road at all, and the really serious\r\nforest work began; two hornets stinging me on the temple and back of\r\nthe neck, as I forced my way through the first bush. Martinez went in\r\nfront as pioneer, clearing away obstructions with his _machete_, and\r\nthe rest of our little party followed. Between lordly trees of great\r\nheight the ground was entirely choked up with creepers, fallen masses\r\nof tangled bamboo, and long tendrils which twisted round our ankles,\r\nand tripped us up at every step. Ten miles on open ground is only equal\r\nto one over such country as this. In many places we had to scramble\r\nthrough the same dense forest, along the verge of giddy precipices\r\nwhich overhung the river. Often we came upon tracks where a giant of\r\nthe forest had fallen, bearing all before it, and finally dashing over\r\nthe cliff into the river below. The Tambopata was boiling and surging\r\nover a rocky bed, at times far below us, while at others we took\r\nadvantage of a short strip of rocky beach to escape the forest. Thus we\r\nstruggled on until sunset, when we reached a stony beach, and encamped\r\nfor the night. This had been a most fatiguing march. In some places we\r\nwere a quarter of an hour forcing and cutting our way through a space\r\nof twenty yards, and the halt was most welcome. It was a wild scene\r\nas the darkness closed round: the camp-fire and Indians on the beach,\r\nthe dense gloomy forest close behind, the boiling river in front, and\r\nforest-clad mountains rising up on the other side.\r\n\r\nFrom this, the first day of our forest-life, until the 14th of May,\r\nbeing just a fortnight, we were actively engaged in the examination\r\nof the chinchona region, and in the collection of plants. As the best\r\nway of recording the results of our investigations, I now propose to\r\ngive a detailed account of our proceedings from day to day; and, in\r\nthe following chapter, to recapitulate our observations with special\r\nreference to the climate, soil, and general habit of those species of\r\nchinchonæ which came immediately under our notice. I owe much to the\r\nintelligent assistance of our guide Martinez, who, to great experience\r\nin woodcraft, added a lynx's eye for a _Calisaya_-plant; and it\r\nrequired no little quickness and penetration to distinguish these\r\ntreasures, amidst the close entanglement of the undergrowth, in the\r\ndense forests. Martinez spoke Spanish very imperfectly, and, without a\r\nknowledge of Quichua, I should have found much difficulty in conversing\r\nwith him; but he had a most complete and thorough knowledge of all\r\nforest-lore, and was acquainted with the native name of almost every\r\nplant, and with the uses to which they were or might be applied.\r\n\r\nAt dawn the Indians found the marks of a jaguar on the beach close\r\nto the tent; and a huge snake wriggled through the fallen trees as\r\nwe re-entered the forest. The brilliant colours and great variety of\r\nbutterflies were very striking. I particularly noticed one, bright\r\nblue and crimson above, with the underside marked with a pattern, as\r\nif drawn by a crow-quill on a snow-white ground, edged with deep blue.\r\nAfter struggling through the forest for about a mile we came to the\r\nfoot of the tremendous precipices, one on either side of the river,\r\nwhich Martinez called Ccasa-sani. That on our (the western) shore rises\r\nup perpendicularly from the water to a height which we estimated at 500\r\nfeet, ending in a rocky peak. Its sides are masses of bare polished\r\nrock, except in the rear, and in some crevices, where vegetation finds\r\na foothold. Amongst other trees the paccay (_Mimosa Inga_), with its\r\ncottony fruit, was drooping over the bubbling waves. The river, surging\r\nfuriously over and around huge masses of rock, dashed noisily on\r\nbetween the two precipices.\r\n\r\nWe had to ascend the western precipice of Ccasa-sani by a frightful\r\nkind of ladder, formed of ledges in the rock, or half-rotten branches\r\nof trees, here and there having to cross a yawning chasm on the fallen\r\nstems of tree-ferns rotting from age. Near the summit we had a glorious\r\nview of the forest-covered mountains, running up into sharp peaks,\r\nwith graceful palms rising above the other trees on their crests, and\r\nstanding out against the sky. Several _Calisaya_-trees were growing\r\non the summit, with bunches of young capsules, in company with the\r\nleathery-leafed _huaturu_, and the _Aceite de Maria_ (_Elæagia Mariæ_,\r\nWedd.). The latter is a tree about thirty feet high, with bark covered\r\nwith white lichens. Among the numerous ferns the most conspicuous was\r\na very large _Polypodium_, called _calaguala_. Descending the rocks of\r\nCcasa-sani, we had to continue the work of cutting our way through the\r\nforest, our passage being opposed by matted entanglements of bamboo,\r\nand a _Panicum_ with blades, the edges of which cut like a penknife,\r\ncalled _challi-challi_. On many of the trees there were hornets'-nests,\r\nglobes of mud fixed to the leaves, and covered with the insects. I was\r\ninadvertently going to touch one, which was attached to the back of\r\na large fern-frond, when Martinez, with great dexterity, hurled the\r\nplants down the precipice, before the savage creatures were aware of\r\ntheir danger.\r\n\r\nWe were now in the midst of the chinchona region; and passed several\r\ntrees of _C. ovata_ (_morada ordinaria_) and _C. micrantha_ (_verde\r\npaltaya_). There were also great quantities of a false chinchona,\r\ncalled by Martinez _Carhua-carhua blanca_. We passed through several\r\nlarge groves of this species, which appeared to be a _Lasionema_, but\r\ndiffered in several respects from the _L. chinchonoides_, mentioned\r\nby Dr. Weddell as growing in the Caravayan forests. The tree is very\r\ncommon near the banks of the river Tambopata, frequently with its\r\nboughs, large coarse leaves, and panicles of flowers, drooping over the\r\nwater.[333]\r\n\r\nThe magnitude and variety of the trees of the forest were very\r\nstriking; and the imposing character of the scenery, in these vast\r\nsolitudes, was a source of constant enjoyment, and lightened the\r\nfatigues of the journey. Among the wonders of the forest there were\r\nenormous trees with great buttressed trunks, others sending down\r\nrope-like tendrils from the branches in every direction, the gigantic\r\nbalsam-tree, the india-rubber tree, and many others. A list of the\r\nferns or mosses, endless in the variety of their shape and size, would\r\nfill volumes. Of palms, also, there were many kinds. The tall _chonta_,\r\nwith its hard serviceable wood; the slender beautiful _chinilla_\r\n(_Euterpe?_); the towering _muruna_ (_Iriartea?_), with its roots\r\nshooting out in every direction from eight feet above the ground, and\r\ntriangular-notched leaflets; the _chaquisapa_ (_Astrocaryum?_), with\r\nits lofty stem thickly set with alternate rings of spines, and thorny\r\nleaves; the _sumballu_ (_Giulielma?_), a beautiful palm with a slender\r\nstem covered with long sharp spines, numerous graceful leaves, and an\r\nedible fruit; and above all the _sayal_, the monarch of the palms of\r\nthese forests, with a rather short thick stem, inner fibres of the\r\nstalks like black wool, but with enormous leaves growing rather erect\r\nfrom the stem to a length of at least forty feet--I should think they\r\nmust be the largest leaves in the whole vegetable kingdom. Among the\r\nbright flowers there were crimson _Melastomaceæ_, called _ccesuara_, a\r\nscarlet _Justitia_, the _Manetia coccinea_, and many beautiful orchids\r\nin the branches of the trees.\r\n\r\nAt length, after a very hard day's work, we reached the mouth of\r\nthe Yana-mayu[334] or Black river; and attempted to wade across the\r\nTambopata, but found it too powerful. I was particularly anxious to\r\neffect this, as Martinez assured me that chinchona-trees were most\r\nabundant on the right or eastern bank. We, however, managed to get upon\r\nan island, near the left bank, and encamped for the night on a shingly\r\nbeach. After sunset it came on to rain very heavily, and the waters\r\nfoamed furiously around us in the inky darkness. The rain continued\r\nto pour down, and the waters to rise through the night, and I hourly\r\nexpected the island to be submerged; but, fortunately, we escaped this\r\ndanger, though the river came up to within a very few feet of the\r\ntent-door. I served out a dram of brandy to all hands.\r\n\r\nIn the morning of May 3rd I continued my attempts to cross the river,\r\nby stripping and trying the water for a ford at several points, with\r\na long pole as a support. But the water was deep, much swollen, and\r\nvery rapid; and, after having twice been as nearly as possible carried\r\naway by the fury of the stream, I was obliged unwillingly to give up\r\nthe attempt for the present. I considered it prudent also to remove\r\nour encampment from the island, and to establish it on a narrow beach\r\novershadowed by the forest, at the point where the muddy waters of the\r\nYana-mayu unite with those of the Tambopata.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements having been made, we devoted the day to an\r\nexamination of the adjacent forest. The spot on which we were encamped\r\nwas about 4600 feet above the sea. Our tent was pitched close to the\r\nfoaming torrent, and behind rose up the tall dark forests. In front\r\nwere the steep green sides of the Yana-mayu ravine, while looking down\r\nthe river the view was bounded by forest-covered mountains, surmounted\r\nby the lofty peak of Corimamani. On the actual banks of the river\r\nthere were trees of _C. micrantha_, with large bunches of lovely and\r\ndeliciously sweet white flowers; many _carhua-carhua blancas_; and a\r\nchinchonaceous tree, which Martinez called _Huiñapu_. The _Huiñapu_\r\ngrows low down and near the banks of rivers. Its capsules are three\r\ninches long; and the veins of the leaves are a pale purple. Dr. Weddell\r\ntells me that he recollects gathering the leaves of the _Huiñapu_, and\r\nthat he took it to be a variety of _Cascarilla magnifolia_.\r\n\r\nWe commenced the day's work in the forest on the south-west slopes of\r\nthe Yana-mayu ravine, scrambling up the steep forest-covered declivity\r\namongst palms, tree-ferns, bamboos, and trees with buttressed trunks of\r\nstupendous size. Here too were the vast leaves of the _sayal_ palm. At\r\na height of 400 feet above the river the _Calisaya_ region commences;\r\nwhile in the lower belt, from the river banks to a height of 400 feet,\r\nthe most abundant chinchonaceous plant is the _Carhua-carhua grande_\r\n(_Cascarilla Carua_, Wedd.), with very fragrant white flowers. I met\r\nwith flowers and capsules together on the same tree, which is forty\r\nfeet high, with a thick trunk, fine spreading branches, and masses of\r\nbeautiful white flowers.\r\n\r\nI found that the _C. Calisaya_ region extended in a belt from 450\r\nto 650 feet above the banks of the river; bamboos, large palms,\r\n_C. micranthas_, _Huiñapus_, _Lasionemas_, and the _Cascarilla\r\ncarua_ being found below that line, and other species of chinchonæ\r\nand chinchonaceous plants above it. We collected twenty-five\r\n_Calisaya_-plants, two of them fine strong seedlings, and the remainder\r\nroot-shoots springing up from trees which had been cut down by\r\n_cascarilleros_ in former times, but with good spreading roots of their\r\nown. The search was exceedingly hard work, scrambling through matted\r\nundergrowth, and up steep ascents, through masses of rotting vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was devoted to an examination of the heights on the\r\nnorth-east side of the Yana-mayu, where, at an elevation of 450 feet,\r\nthere is a level table-land, covered with palms and bamboos. The\r\nsearch was chiefly conducted along a ridge above this plateau, where\r\nthe bamboos ended. We obtained twenty more plants of _C. Calisaya_,\r\none of which was declared by Martinez to be a _Calisaya morada_ (_C.\r\nBoliviana_, Wedd.), and the leaf agreed well with Dr. Weddell's\r\ndescription, though that botanist believed that the species was not\r\nfound in this part of Caravaya, but only in the valleys of Ayapata,\r\nfurther north. To-day we saw a couple of _tunquis_,[335] birds with\r\nthe most gorgeous plumage I ever beheld. They are the size of large\r\npigeons, with orange-scarlet feathers on the head, neck, breast, and\r\ntail, black wings, light-grey back, and scarlet crest. They have\r\na shrill, harsh cry. The butterflies and moths were numerous and\r\nbrilliant, but so tame, and in such swarms, as to be a perfect plague.\r\nThere was one bright swallow-tail, with blue wings, fringed with\r\ncrimson. The torments from venomous insects were maddening; especially\r\nfrom a kind of fly which in a moment raised swellings and blood-red\r\nlumps all over the hands and face, causing great pain and irritation.\r\nDuring the night it rained heavily, with peals of thunder, and vivid\r\nflashes of lightning, while the river increased in size, and roared\r\npast the tent noisily.\r\n\r\nThe collection of chinchona-plants was deposited in a shady place, near\r\nthe tent, the roots being well covered over with soft moss.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of May 4th the river was so swollen as to destroy\r\nall hopes of crossing it for the present. It frequently changed its\r\ncolour, on one morning the surging flood being black, on another\r\ntolerably clear, and on another a light muddy colour. By these means\r\nMartinez could always tell where the rains had been heaviest, and what\r\nstream was contributing an unusual freshet to swell the waters of the\r\nTambopata.\r\n\r\nI devoted the day to examining the forest on the declivities\r\noverhanging the left bank of the Tambopata, and this was by far the\r\nmost toilsome and dangerous forest journey we had yet made, rendered\r\nworse by a comparative want of success. The whole way was along giddy\r\nprecipices, seeming to hang half way between the sky and the roaring\r\ntorrent, with no foothold but decaying leaves, nothing to grasp but\r\nrotten branches, every motion a drenching bath from wet leaves, every\r\nother step a painful and dangerous slip or fall, besides hornets,\r\nand endless thorns. Among the latter I was struck by a tree called\r\n_itapallu_, with trunk and branches thickly set with thorns, very\r\nlarge leaves, and the fruit in clusters, like bunches of pearls with\r\npurple stalks. We met with large pigeons, flocks of green parrots,\r\nparoquets, and tunquis. The forest peeps across the river were\r\nsuperb, but it was difficult to enjoy them. Martinez pointed out a\r\nsmall _Asplenium_, called _espincu_, which has a sweet taste, and is\r\nsometimes chewed by the Indians for want of coca; and the _panchi_,\r\na tall slender malvaceous tree, with large round leaves on spreading\r\nbranches at the top, and very white wood. It is used by the Chunchos\r\nfor procuring fire by friction, and the bark, which peels off in long\r\nstrips, is serviceable for girdles. During this day we came to the\r\nlargest _Calisaya_ we had yet seen, and Martinez operated on the bark\r\nto show his dexterity as a cascarillero, which was remarkable.[336]\r\nOur collection only amounted to fourteen plants, among them two fine\r\nseedlings of _C. Calisaya_, two of _C. micrantha_, two of _C. ovata,\r\nvar. β rufinervis_, and the remainder root-shoots of _C. Calisaya_:\r\nseedlings of the latter species are exceedingly rare. We returned to\r\nour camp dead beat, and drenched to the skin, only to find that my\r\nIndians were mutinous, declaring that they had been away long enough,\r\nthat they had no maize or coca left, and that they must return to\r\ntheir homes at once. Our only hope rested upon them, and, if they\r\nhad deserted, all our plans would have been entirely frustrated. It,\r\nhowever, required no little persuasion and eloquence to induce them to\r\nchange their minds, and, as they had nothing left to eat, I sent Andres\r\nVilca back to Gironda, to entreat him to supply us with a few chuñus\r\nand a little coca. I then told the others, in their own expressive\r\nlanguage, that if they deserted me they were liars, thieves, traitors,\r\nand children of the Devil, whose punishment would soon overtake them;\r\nwhile if they were true to me they would be well rewarded, and would\r\nenjoy the friendship of a Viracocha. After this great effort in\r\nQuichua, the evening ended pleasantly. The Indians had built themselves\r\na little shed of palm-leaves near the tent door, a bright fire was\r\nlighted, and its cheery reflection danced on the waves of the noisy\r\nflood.\r\n\r\nIt rained heavily through the night, and in the morning, hearing from\r\nMartinez that the varieties of _C. ovata_, the collection of which had\r\nbeen recommended to me by Dr. Weddell, were only found in a zone at a\r\nmuch greater elevation than that of the _C. Calisayas_, I devoted the\r\nday to a search in an almost vertical direction, on the north-east side\r\nof the Yana-mayu, towards some heights called Pacchani.\r\n\r\nAscending the steep sides of the ravine of Yana-mayu for about two\r\nhundred feet, we reached a narrow level shelf covered with ferns and\r\nthe huge leaves of the _sayal_ palm. The locality was very damp and\r\nshady, and the _C. micrantha_, _Huiñapu_, and _Cascarilla Carua_\r\nwere in great abundance. We continued to ascend through the forest\r\nwhich covered the sides of the steep mountain, for several hours\r\ncontinuously; the footing consisting of decayed leaves and rotten\r\ntrunks, moss and ferns covering every tree, and all the vegetation\r\nintensely humid. At a height of 750 feet above the river we came to\r\nsome trees of the _beno-beno_ (_Pimentelia gomphosia_,[337] Wedd.),\r\nwith its bright laurel-like leaves and minute capsules; the _C.\r\npubescens_, called by Martinez _cascarilla amarilla_, still only in\r\nbud, which was very abundant; and large trees of the _morada naranjada_\r\n(_C. ovata, var. α vulgaris_, Wedd.). Near this place a troop of about\r\ntwenty monkeys went chattering along the tops of the trees, and while I\r\nwas looking at them a huge black hornet rushed up out of the moss and\r\nstung me on the chin. These savage creatures make their nests under the\r\nearth, and are called _huancoyru_.\r\n\r\nAfter a long and wearisome but fruitless search for young plants of\r\nthe _zamba morada_ (the _β rufinervis_ variety of _C. ovata_) in these\r\nexcessively damp forests, we began the descent again. Nothing struck\r\nme so much as the extraordinary variety of forms and shapes in which\r\nnature works in these tropical forests. One is amazed to see enormous\r\ntrees with their gigantic roots separating at least twenty feet above\r\nthe ground, and forming perfect Gothic arches. In one place a giant\r\nof the forest had grown on the edge of a ridge of rock, and the roots\r\nhad combined with the stone to form a spacious vaulted cave large\r\nenough to hold ten men comfortably. Beautiful variegated leaves of\r\n_Colocasiæ_, and a scarlet-flowered _Justitia_, with bright purple\r\nleaves, united with a profusion of ferns to ornament the opening, while\r\nsome tree-ferns, and a _chinilla_, the most slender and elegant of the\r\npalms of the forest, guarded the entrance. Rays of the sun struggled\r\nthrough a network of bamboos on an opposite bank, and penetrated into\r\nthe recesses of the cavern. While I gazed on this lovely scene, the\r\nplaintive mournful notes of the little \"_Alma perdida_\" reached me from\r\nthe boughs of the great tree. This is a small bird of the finch tribe,\r\nof which there are two kinds, one black, the other chesnut with black\r\nwings. Their loud clear note is peculiarly sad. Such peeps as these\r\ninto the secret beauties of the innermost forest recesses are rewards\r\nfor many hours of toil and disappointment.\r\n\r\nLate in the evening I returned to the tent dead tired, sodden and\r\nwet to the skin, covered with moss and fungus, bitten all over by\r\nmosquitos, stung by a hornet, and with hands sliced in pieces by the\r\nsharp blades of a _Panicum_ called _challi-challi_, but with only three\r\nplants of the valuable variety of _C. ovata_. It is most provoking that\r\nonly the seedlings of all the worthless species of Chinchonæ should be\r\nin great abundance; the reason is of course connected with the general\r\nfelling of the trees of valuable species by the cascarilleros, years\r\nago.\r\n\r\nThere was little rain during the night, and on May 6th we commenced the\r\nsearch of a range of forest on the south-west side of the Yana-mayu\r\nravine, where we found a large supply of plants of _C. Calisaya_. At a\r\nheight of 500 feet above the river there was a ridge of rock jutting\r\nout from the forest-covered sides of the ravine. In this spot the\r\nground was not nearly so thickly covered with vegetation; there were\r\nno palms, tree-ferns, or plants requiring extreme moisture, and young\r\nplants received shade from taller trees, while they also enjoyed plenty\r\nof sunshine through the spreading branches. The most abundant plants\r\nwere _Melastomas_, _huaturus_, and _Panica_, which climb amongst the\r\nbranches to a height of thirty feet and upwards. These afford but very\r\nslight shade, and below there is an undergrowth of ferns, _Colocasiæ_,\r\nand young plants. In different parts of this ridge we collected 124\r\nyoung _C. Calisaya_ plants, most of them root-shoots, and a few\r\nseedlings. There were also two young trees bearing capsules. The _C.\r\nCalisaya_ plants were all growing out of the moss which covered the\r\nrock to a thickness of eight inches or a foot, together with beautiful\r\n_Hymenophylla_,[338] but there was scarcely any soil. The roots\r\nspread along the face of the rock, which is a metamorphic clay slate,\r\nunfossiliferous, slightly micaceous, and ferruginous;[339] and is\r\neasily broken up into thin layers by the growth of the plants. In this\r\nsituation the _C. Calisayas_ were more numerous than in any other we\r\nhave yet seen.\r\n\r\nTwo bears had made themselves a comfortable and very carefully\r\nprepared bed on the summit of the ridge, whence there was an extensive\r\nbird's-eye view of the windings of the river, and of the forest-covered\r\nmountains beyond. On the opposite mountains there were two or three\r\nlong bare places--tremendous landslips, not unfrequent occurrences in\r\nthe forest. There is a sudden crash, when masses of rock, huge trees,\r\nand underwood come rushing down in one fell irresistible swoop. A\r\nbeautiful white _Stephanotis_ was climbing over the rocks. We returned\r\nto the camp in a heavy fall of rain, after a very severe but successful\r\nday's work, and found that both the Indians and ourselves had come to\r\nthe end of our provisions, and that Andres Vilca Lad not returned.\r\n\r\nOn May 7th we rose to find only a few bread-crumbs in the corner of our\r\nbag, and, as famine was thus knocking at the door, it became necessary\r\nto beat a hasty retreat. The plants were carefully packed in layers\r\nof moss, and sown up in two bundles of Russia matting, which we had\r\nbrought with us, containing about 200 chinchona-plants. In the absence\r\nof Andres Vilca, Mr. Weir showed much zeal and energy in undertaking\r\nto carry one of these bundles, four and a half feet in circumference,\r\nover the slippery and dangerous road, in doing which he fell into the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of May 7th, when we commenced our retreat, it was\r\npouring with rain, and the forest was saturated, our bodies sodden,\r\nour hands crumpled like washerwomen's, and our powder damp. We had to\r\nwade across many little streams falling into the Tambopata. The first,\r\nafter leaving the Yana-mayu, was called Churu-bamba, because it empties\r\nitself just opposite an island (_churu_, in Quichua). The next stream\r\nwas _Uma-yuyu_, _uma_ being water in Aymara, and _yuyu_ a plant with\r\na large cordate dock-like leaf, used in _chupes_. Thus every little\r\nstream and hill had received a name from the cascarilleros of former\r\ntimes, from some peculiarity of position or other similar circumstance,\r\nwhich would easily impress it on the memory. What an improvement on\r\nthe nomenclature in new countries discovered by Englishmen, where\r\nwe have an endless succession of Jones's rivers, Smith's mountains,\r\nand Brown's islands! Near the banks of these streams there are very\r\nlarge snail-shells, and Martinez described the snails as \"large kind\r\nof hornets, all made of flesh, which do not sting.\" He called them\r\n_Mamachuru_, or \"Mother of the Island.\"\r\n\r\nOn reaching the precipice of Ccasa-sani we scrambled along its slippery\r\nsides, in the pouring rain, to collect plants of _C. Calisaya_, and\r\nobtained twenty-one good ones. They were growing in a similar situation\r\nto those above the Yana-mayu, in company with a number of _Aceite de\r\nMaria_ trees (_Elæagia Mariæ_),[340] and completely exposed to the\r\nsun, without any shade whatever. Passing the precipice, we continued\r\nour damp weary journey, Martinez pointing out everything that\r\nwas noticeable by the way, especially the _palo santo_ (_Guaiacum\r\nsanctum_), a very tall tree, the stem 60 to 70 feet high, without a\r\nbranch, with a few short horizontally spreading branches at the summit,\r\nwith pinnate leaves. When the bark is cut, a host of stinging ants\r\ncome forth. There was also a plant, which he called _achira silvestre_\r\n(_Canna achira?_) with a rhizome, and bunches of rank red berries. We\r\npassed through groves of paccays (_Mimosa Inga_), a creeping legume\r\nwith bright flowers, wild coca, many _Lasionemas_, with their large\r\ncoarse leaves drooping over the river, and a melastomaceous plant with\r\na crimson fruit. After having been nearly carried away by the force of\r\nthe Challuma river, in wading across it, I reached Gironda's hospitable\r\nshed, after a journey of more than thirty miles, in pouring rain.\r\n\r\nOn May 8th I left Gironda's clearing, with Martinez, in order to\r\nexamine the forests above the hut of Tambopata, for plants of _C.\r\nCalisaya_. Here, in almost exactly a similar ridge of rock to those\r\nwhich proved so prolific of these precious plants on the heights\r\nabove the Yana-mayu, and on the precipice of Ccasa-sani, I found a\r\nnumber of plants of _Calisaya morada_ (_C. Boliviana_, Wedd.), growing\r\nout of moss, amongst the rocks, with scarcely any soil. They were\r\novershadowed by numerous trees, called by Martinez \"Compadre[341] de\r\nCalisaya\" (_Gomphosia chlorantha_, Wedd.), one of the most graceful and\r\nbeautiful of the chinchonaceous plants, with deliciously sweet flowers.\r\nDr. Weddell exactly describes it as rising without a branch above\r\nall the trees of the forest, and then spreading out in the form of a\r\nchandelier, and attracting the attention of the traveller from afar.\r\nThe bark of this tree, with its transverse cracks, can with difficulty\r\nbe distinguished from that of _C. Calisaya_. Whilst climbing amongst\r\nthese rocks, I nearly put my hand on a small viper of a most venomous\r\nkind, 18 inches long, with a black skin marked with yellow rings,\r\nedged with white. In the evening we returned to Gironda's clearing at\r\nLenco-huayccu, with eighty-seven chinchona-plants, sixteen of Calisaya\r\nfina (_C. Calisaya, var. α vera_), and sixty-nine of Calisaya morada\r\n(_C. Boliviana_, Wedd.).\r\n\r\nWe found Gironda, on whom we were now entirely dependent for food, very\r\nlittle better off than ourselves. His supplies consisted of maize,\r\nyucas, aracachas, chuñus or frozen potatoes, and quispiñas, made of\r\nboiled quinoa-grains dried in the sun, ground, and preserved as little\r\ngritty hard lumps. He also had some _achocches_, which are poor watery\r\ncucurbitaceous things, squeezed, and served up in chupes. No salt.\r\n\r\nThough frequently baffled, and more than once exposed to much risk in\r\nmaking vain attempts, I had never given up my determination to have at\r\nleast one day's work on the right bank of the Tambopata. For some days\r\nthe volume of water had been gradually decreasing, but it was still\r\n40 yards across, and rushing with great velocity over a ford which\r\nGironda believed to exist a little below Lenco-huayccu. I stripped and\r\nwent in, with the stem of a young _chonta_ palm as a support, but, on\r\napproaching the mid-channel, the water came up above my middle, the\r\nlarge pebbles slipped and rolled under my feet, and for some time it\r\nwas with the utmost difficulty that I held my own; but finally we all\r\nreached the right bank in safety.\r\n\r\nWe were rewarded by a very successful day's work. After ascending the\r\nsteep ravine, through the zone of bamboos, to a height of 400 feet, we\r\nreached a ridge of rocks, where we collected 109 good chinchona-plants\r\nof the _Calisaya morada_ species. The leaves of the chinchonæ, and\r\nmore especially the _Calisaya_ species, are invariably perforated\r\nby holes in every direction. Much of this mischief is the work of\r\ncaterpillars, but it may partly be attributed to the effects of drip\r\nfrom the trees which overshadow them. In this forest there were trees\r\nof great height, without a branch for a distance of 50 or 60 feet\r\nfrom the ground, which Martinez called _canela_. The inner bark had a\r\nstrong taste of cinnamon, and they use it to scent and flavour their\r\n_huarapu_, or fermented juice of the sugar-cane. On many trees, in\r\nthe forest, there are immense masses of earth fixed on the trunk,\r\ncalled _cotocuro_. They consist of exceedingly thin layers, one added\r\nto another until they are sometimes of an immense size, eight to ten\r\nfeet high, and three or four feet across. They are made by myriads and\r\nmyriads of small yellowish lice, which swarm between each thin layer.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we incurred the same risks in wading across the river\r\nagain, but arrived without any accident at Gironda's clearing, where we\r\nnow had a depôt of 436 chinchona-plants.\r\n\r\nOn May 10th I resolved to make a search on the heights immediately\r\nabove Lenco-huayccu, called Gloriapata, for the valuable red-nerved\r\nvariety of _C. ovata_. I first paid a visit to the poor little Indian\r\nwife and children of Martinez at Huaccay-churu, in a hut of split\r\nbamboos, surrounded by aracachas, yucas, camotes with their white\r\nconvolvulus flowers, plantains, frijoles or beans, and the _Amaranthus\r\ncaudatus_, which they call _jataccu_ and _cuimi_, using the leaves in\r\n_chupes_. We then struck right up the steep declivity of Gloriapata,\r\nmaking our way with difficulty through the dense bamboo thickets,\r\nwhich, in spite of their obstinate obstructiveness, make excellent\r\ncisterns, and their joints will always afford a good drink of cool\r\nwater. For some time we followed a pathway made by a herd of peccaries,\r\nuntil it ended at the mouth of a cave which, though low, appeared to\r\nbe of considerable size. These peccaries come down in herds of thirty\r\nor forty to the clearings, during the night, and do much damage amongst\r\nthe roots. Some are black and white, and others of a leaden colour.\r\n\r\nAfter ascending for several hundred feet we came to trees of _C.\r\npubescens_, which appear to belong to a zone just below, but in contact\r\nwith the _C. ovatæ_. Their leaves were eaten by a caterpillar, red at\r\nboth ends, with a horn, red stripe down the back, and red spots on each\r\nside, body striped green and yellow. Some hundred feet higher there\r\nwere large trees of both varieties of _C. ovata_, growing in very moist\r\nparts of the forest, where the trees were covered with _Hymenophylla_\r\nand dripping moss, the former a sure sign of extreme humidity. The\r\nground was covered with fallen leaves to a great depth, and there\r\nwas a good deal of shade. We collected seven plants of _C. ovata,\r\nvar. α vulgaris_, and eleven of _C. ovata, var. β rufinervis_, five\r\nof which were strong healthy seedlings, the remainder being suckers,\r\nwith spreading roots of their own. With the _C. ovatæ_ grows the\r\n_Carhua-carhua chica_ (_Cascarilla bullata_, Wedd.).\r\n\r\nIn descending from these heights I came to a tree which Martinez called\r\n_copal_, but the trunk rose to such an extraordinary height, without\r\nbranches, that I was unable to make out the appearance of the leaves or\r\nflowers. The bark was covered with a milk-white fragrant resin, of a\r\nnature analogous to _gum thus_ or _gum elemi_. The forest also abounds\r\nin vegetable and bees' wax, and in many varieties of gums and resins.\r\n\r\nOn May 11th, as we had now collected a sufficient number of\r\nchinchona-plants, including those of the shrub _Calisaya_ which we\r\nintended to take up on our return across the _pajonales_, to fill\r\nthe Wardian cases at Islay, Mr. Weir began to make up the plants in\r\nlayers, with plenty of moss between them, ready for sewing up in the\r\nRussia matting. Having heard that a young man, a nephew of Gironda's,\r\nhad planted a _C. Calisaya_ in a small clearing a few leagues up the\r\nravine, I went to examine it. The clearing was on a steep declivity\r\nsloping down to the river, and had been partly planted with coffee\r\nand coca by its solitary occupant. The tree was a _Calisaya morada_,\r\nhaving been a root-shoot twelve inches high when it was planted in\r\nJanuary, 1859. It is now seven feet high, six inches and four-tenths\r\nin circumference round the trunk, and three feet three inches across\r\nthe longest branches from one side of the stem to the other. It was\r\ngrowing on the side of a steep hill, quite open to the south, east,\r\nand south-east, at the edge of a clearing, while mountains covered\r\nwith forest rise up close behind it, on the north and west, to a great\r\nheight. It is planted in a soil consisting of stiff yellowish loam,\r\ncomposed of vegetable matter, mixed with the disintegration of the\r\nsoft clay slate. This is probably the only cultivated chinchona-tree\r\nin Peru. In returning to Lenco-huayccu I saw a flock of _Alectors_,\r\nlarge birds analogous to turkeys, and many parrots; and on my arrival I\r\nfound that Mr. Weir had already made up the chinchona-plants, in four\r\nRussia-matting bundles, ready to start for Sandia on the following\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nGENERAL REMARKS ON THE CHINCHONA-PLANTS OF CARAVAYA.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE range of my observations in the chinchona-forests extended for\r\na distance of forty miles along the western side of the ravine of\r\nTambopata, and one day's journey on the eastern side. This region\r\nis covered, with few exceptions, from the banks of the river to\r\nthe summits of the mountain-peaks, by a dense tropical forest. The\r\nformation is everywhere, as I have before said, an unfossiliferous,\r\nmicaceous, slightly ferruginous, metamorphic clay-slate, with veins\r\nof quartz, and the streams all contain more or less gold-dust. When\r\nexposed to the weather this clay-slate quickly turns to a sticky yellow\r\nmud,[342] and lower down it is very brittle, and easily breaks off\r\nin thin layers. The soil formed by the disintegration of the rock,\r\nmixed with decayed vegetable matter, is a heavy yellowish brown loam,\r\nbut there is very little of it on the rocky sides of the ravine, and\r\nno depth of soil except on the few level spaces and gentle slopes\r\nnear the banks of the river. Mr. Forbes, in speaking of the extensive\r\nrange of Silurian formation, of which the Tambopata hills form a part,\r\nattributes the frequent occurrence of veins of auriferous quartz,\r\nusually associated with iron pyrites, to the proximity of granite,\r\nwhence they have been injected into the Silurian slates. In the cooling\r\nand solidification of granite the quartz is the last mineral element\r\nto crystallize and become solid, and he suggests that, during the\r\ncooling, the consequent expansion due to the crystallization of the\r\nconstituents has forced the quartz and gold, still fluid, into the\r\nfissures of the neighbouring rocks, and so formed the auriferous quartz\r\nveins. These are only developed in the slate rocks, which, when such\r\nveins occur, must be at no great distance from granitic eruptions,\r\neither visible, or such as may be inferred to exist.[343]\r\n\r\nThe chinchona forests which I examined in the Tambopata valley are\r\nbetween lat. 13° and 12° 30´ S. The elevation above the sea, on the\r\nbanks of the river, is 4200 feet, while the loftiest crests of the\r\nmountains which overhang it on either side attain an elevation of about\r\n5000 feet. In the preceding chapter I have given a general idea of the\r\nnature of the climate throughout the year, and my stay was too short to\r\nenable me to give any more detailed information for most of the months;\r\nbut I did not fail to take careful observations while I remained in\r\nthe valley, which will give an accurate idea of the climate during the\r\nmonth of May. During the fourteen first days of May the results were as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  Mean temperature                   69-5/6° Fahr.\r\n   \"       \"       at 7 A.M.         68\r\n   \"       \"       at 3 P.M.         71-1/2\r\n   \"       \"       at 9 P.M.         69\r\n  Mean minimum in the night          62-5/7\r\n  Highest temperature observed       75\r\n  Lowest      \"           \"          56\r\n  Entire range                       19\r\n  Mean variation in the 24 hours     10-1/3\r\n  Greatest       \"         \"         15\r\n  Least          \"         \"          6\r\n  Mean of the dew-point              61-4/5 }\r\n       \"          \"     at 7 A.M.    61.9   } Dry bulb\r\n       \"          \"     at 3 P.M.    62.5   } as above.\r\n       \"          \"     at 9 P.M.    60.9   }\r\n\r\nThe wind generally blows up the valley during the daytime, when the\r\nclouds ascend, to be condensed by the colder night-air. Thus we\r\nalmost invariably had rain at night, generally in a heavy fall, but\r\noccasionally in small drizzle, which usually continued until the\r\nforenoon. At noon it cleared up for a fine afternoon, and only on two\r\noccasions did we have rain throughout the day. The valley, and the\r\ncourse of the river, bear N.N.W. and S.S.E.\r\n\r\nThe three valuable species of chinchonæ found in Tambopata grow in\r\ndistinct zones as regards elevation, together with other chinchonaceous\r\nplants, up the declivitous sides of the ravine.\r\n\r\nFrom the banks of the river to about 400 feet up the mountains, the\r\nforest consists of bamboos, several genera of palms, tree-ferns,\r\npaccays, and other _Leguminosæ_, _Lasionemas_, _Cascarilla Caruas_,\r\nand the _Chinchona micrantha_, together with the chinchonaceous\r\ntree called by Martinez _Huiñapu_. This is the lower zone. The _C.\r\nmicrantha_, called by Martinez _verde paltaya_ and _motosolo_,[344]\r\nwas in flower in May. I met with it constantly in moist low places;\r\nand several trees, with their very large ovate leaves, and bunches of\r\nwhite fragrant flowers, were actually drooped over the waters of the\r\nriver. It produces a good quality of bark, and I collected seven fine\r\nseedling-plants of this species.\r\n\r\nFrom 400 to 600 feet above the river is the middle zone, and that which\r\ncontains the Calisaya-plants. The vegetation chiefly consists of huge\r\nbalsam and India-rubber trees, _huaturus_, _Melastomaceæ_, Aceite de\r\nMaria (_Elæagia Mariæ_), Compadre de Calisaya (_Gomphosia chlorantha_),\r\nand occasional trees of _Cascarilla Carua_, which straggle up from\r\nthe lower zone. Here the young trees of _C. Calisaya_ grow in great\r\nabundance, but the cascarilleros had certainly done their work well in\r\nformer years, for every single tree of any size had been felled, though\r\nmany of the young root-shoots were 20 and 30 feet high, and covered\r\nwith capsule-bearing panicles. These precious trees were most plentiful\r\nunder the ridges of rock which crop out at intervals, where the ground\r\nwas not so thickly covered with vegetation, and where the young plants\r\nobtained plenty of light and air, while they were partially protected\r\nfrom the direct rays of the sun by the spreading branches of taller\r\ntrees. The _Calisaya_-trees, on the Ccasa-sani precipice, however,\r\nhad no shade whatever. They were covered with capsules. I observed\r\nthat when the young plants of _C. Calisaya_ grew up the sides of the\r\nrocks, and actually came in contact, they often threw out roots from\r\ntheir stems or branches. The _C. Calisaya_ is by far the most beautiful\r\ntree of these forests. Its leaves are of a dark rich green, smooth and\r\nshining, with crimson veins, and a green petiole edged with red, and\r\nthe deliciously sweet bunches of flowers are white, with rose-coloured\r\nlaciniæ, edged with white marginal hairs. But it was evident that we\r\ndid not see them to advantage in these forests; they ran up tall and\r\nstraggling, as if seeking the sun, and seemed to pant for more light\r\nand air, and a deeper and richer soil. Martinez told me that, when the\r\nCalisaya is much overshadowed by other trees, it loses the crimson\r\ncolour on the petioles and veins of the leaves; and that fifteen\r\nleagues lower down the river (I suppose at about four thousand feet\r\nabove the sea) the leaves of the _Calisaya morada_ become quite bright\r\npurple all over the under side.\r\n\r\nGironda and Martinez told me that there were three kinds of\r\nCalisaya-trees; namely, the _Calisaya fina_ (_C. Calisaya, α vera_,\r\nWedd.), the _Calisaya morada_ (_C. Boliviana_, Wedd.), and the tall\r\n_Calisaya verde_. They added that the latter was a very large tree,\r\nwithout any red colour in the veins of the leaves, and generally\r\ngrowing far down the valleys, almost in the open plain. A tree of this\r\nvariety yields six or seven quintals of bark, while the _Calisaya fina_\r\nonly yields three or four quintals; and Gironda declared that he had\r\nseen one, in the province of Munecas in Bolivia, which had yielded ten\r\nquintals of _tabla_ or trunk-bark alone.\r\n\r\nMy remarks respecting the position of _C. Calisaya_ trees, on the\r\nsides of the ravine, only apply to the forest below Lenco-huayccu;\r\nabove that position they are not found so high up the sides of the\r\nmountains, probably owing to their greater proximity to the snowy\r\nregion of the cordillera. The nearest snow may be about forty miles\r\nfrom Lenco-huayccu, as the crow flies. I also found that the _Calisaya\r\nfina_ was most abundant about the Yana-mayu, while the variety called\r\n_morada_ was plentiful in the upper part of the ravine. But it was very\r\ndifficult for an unpractised eye to detect the slightest difference\r\nbetween these two varieties, until their leaves were placed side by\r\nside, when that of the _morada_ appeared to be just a shade darker\r\ngreen. Dr. Weddell has, in his work, named the _Calisaya morada_, as a\r\ndistinct species, _C. Boliviana_, but I understand that he is now of\r\nopinion that it is scarcely more than a variety of the _Calisaya vera_,\r\nits bark being very generally collected and sold as that of the latter.\r\nNo plants which I saw in the forests could be compared, for vigour and\r\nregularity of growth, with the tree which I have already described as\r\nhaving been planted on the edge of a clearing; and I think this tends\r\nto prove that plenty of light and air is essential to the vigorous\r\ngrowth of the _C. Calisaya_, so long as there is a sufficient supply\r\nof moisture, and protection from the direct rays of a scorching sun\r\nfor the first year or two. The _C. Calisaya_ is undoubtedly the most\r\ndelicate and sensitive of all the species of chinchona.\r\n\r\nAbove the region occupied by _C. Calisayas_, in the forests, is the\r\nthird or upper zone, from 600 to 800 feet above the river. Here, amidst\r\nvery dense humid vegetation, covered with ferns and mosses, are first\r\nmet the trees of _C. pubescens_, and _Pimentelia glomerata_, and a\r\nlittle higher up are numerous trees of the two valuable species of\r\n_C. ovata_, namely, α _vulgaris_ and β _rufinervis_, with very large\r\novate leaves, the latter being distinguishable by the deep red of the\r\nleaf-veins. The _Cascarilla bullata_ grows with them, and extends still\r\nhigher up the sides of the mountains. The bark of the β _rufinervis_\r\nvariety is habitually used to adulterate the Calisaya, which it very\r\nclosely resembles, and is called _zamba morada_ by the cascarilleros,\r\nwhile the α _vulgaris_ variety is known as _morada ordinaria_. Martinez\r\nsaid that the _zamba morada_ was very tenacious of life, and that,\r\nhaving once thrown away a branch amongst some moss, he found it a\r\nfortnight afterwards, still throwing out shoots. Both varieties of _C.\r\novata_ yield valuable barks.\r\n\r\nAbove the zone of the _C. ovatas_, and nearer the snowy cordillera (for\r\nlower down the valley the forests cover the crests of the mountains),\r\ncommence the open grassy _pajonales_, which I have already described.\r\nHere the formation is exactly the same as that in the valley of\r\nTambopata; and the vegetation of the thickets which fill the gullies,\r\nand are interspersed over the grassy glades, consists of _huaturus_,\r\n_Gaultheriæ_, _Vacciniæ_, _Lasiandræ_, and other _Melastomaceæ_,\r\n_Chinchonæ_, palms, and tree-ferns. The chinchonæ consist of _C.\r\nCaravayensis_, and of the shrubby variety of _C. Calisaya_, which\r\nis called _ychu cascarilla_ by the natives. The shrub _Calisaya_ (β\r\n_Josephiana_) is generally from six and a half to ten feet high, but\r\nI met with an individual plant which I believe to belong to this\r\nvariety, which had attained a height of eighteen and a half feet; and\r\nthis inclined me to think, at the time, that this shrubby form could\r\nnot even be considered as a variety of the normal _C. Calisaya_, and\r\nthat its more lowly habit was merely due to the higher elevation and\r\nmore rigorous climate in which it grew. Dr. Weddell remarks that its\r\nappearance varies very much according to the situation in which it\r\ngrows, and that the colour and texture of the different parts change\r\naccording to the amount of exposure.\r\n\r\nI found the shrub _Calisaya_ in flower in the end of April.\r\n\r\nWe crossed two _pajonal_ regions, one above the valley of Sandia, and\r\nthe other between the valleys of Sandia and Tambopata. The height of\r\nthe former above the level of the sea was 5422 feet, and of the latter\r\n5600 feet. The time of my visit was the end of April and beginning of\r\nMay, and I traversed both regions twice, so that an abstract of my\r\nmeteorological observations will give a tolerably correct idea of the\r\nclimate at that time of the year; although they only extend over the\r\n25th, 26th, 27th, and 28th of April, and a few days in the middle of\r\nMay.\r\n\r\n  Mean temperature                59° Fahr.\r\n  Mean minimum at night           52\r\n  Highest temperature observed    67\r\n  Lowest       \"         \"        49\r\n  Entire range                    18\r\n  Mean of the dew-point           53.6 (dry bulb as above).\r\n\r\nIn the early morning there were generally masses of white clouds lying\r\nin the ravines, and in the afternoon a thick mist drifted across the\r\n_pajonal_, with drizzling rain.\r\n\r\nThe shrub-Calisayas, which were growing plentifully by the roadside,\r\nabove the valley of Sandia, were entirely exposed, without any shade\r\nwhatever, and the hill on which they grew had a western aspect. There\r\nis a difference in elevation of about 1000 feet between the locality\r\nwhere we saw the shrub-Calisayas, and the region of the normal\r\ntree-Calisaya in the Tambopata forests; and the shrubby form is also\r\nmany leagues nearer the snows of the cordillera. These circumstances\r\nare alone sufficient to account for the difference in the habit of\r\nthese two forms of _C. Calisaya_; and there seems to be no doubt that\r\nthe barks of the shrubby varieties of chinchonæ are specially good when\r\ntheir stunted growth is owing to the altitude of the locality.\r\n\r\nOur collection of chinchona-plants in the Tambopata forests, and on the\r\n_pajonales_, was completed on May 14th, as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                                          No. of Plants.\r\n  _C.

Gironda,\r\nthough friendly and hospitable, feared that the finger of scorn would\r\nbe pointed at him, as the man who had allowed the stranger to injure\r\nhis countrymen. He wanted to throw away all the plants, except a few\r\nwhich we might take without observation, and, if we had not kept\r\nconstant guard over them, he would have carried his views into effect\r\nwithout consulting us. I saw that in an immediate retreat was the only\r\nhope of saving the plants; and I explained to Gironda that his views\r\nwere incorrect, and that, if necessary, we were prepared to defend our\r\nproperty by force.\r\n\r\nAt the same time I addressed a letter to Don José Bobadilla, stating\r\nthat his interference was an unwarrantable step which I would not\r\ntolerate; and that, as I understood the provisions of the Constitution\r\nof 1856, the functions of the _Juntas Municipales_ were purely\r\nconsultative and legislative, conferring no executive powers whatever,\r\nconcluding with an expression of my sense of his patriotic zeal, and of\r\nregret that it should be accompanied by such misguided and lamentable\r\nignorance of the true interests of his country. Nevertheless, I felt\r\nthe imperative necessity of immediate flight, especially as I obtained\r\ninformation from an Indian of Quiaca that Martel's son and his party,\r\nwho had brought the letter, were only the vanguard of a body of\r\nmestizos, who were coming down the valley to seize me, and destroy my\r\ncollection of chinchona-plants.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning of May 12th we took leave of our kind and\r\nhospitable old friend Gironda, without whose assistance we should have\r\nbeen exposed to much suffering from want of food; and of the honest\r\nforester Martinez. I expressed my sincere regret to Gironda that any\r\nmisunderstanding should have arisen at the close of our acquaintance,\r\nand promised Martinez to obtain guarantees that he should suffer no\r\nmolestation on account of the services he had rendered to me. The most\r\nmelancholy part of travelling is the parting with friends, never to\r\nmeet again.\r\n\r\nAfter a laborious ascent through the forest we found Martel's son and\r\nhis party stationed on the verge of the _pajonal_. They were evidently\r\nwaiting for us, but did not attempt to impede our passage, and a\r\ndisplay of my revolver, although it may have been very efficacious,\r\nwas perfectly harmless, as the powder was quite damp. The young Martel\r\nasked the Indians in Quichua how they dared to carry the plants, and\r\ncalled after them that they would be seized at Sandia; but he was\r\ncivil to me, and we continued our journey peaceably, though full of\r\napprehensions at the turn affairs might take on our arrival at Sandia.\r\n\r\nWe had to cross the same country as we had traversed in our journey\r\nto the Tambopata valley; and, in skirting along the verge of a ridge,\r\nnear the Marun-kunka, the cargo-mule fell headlong down a precipice of\r\ntwenty feet, into a dense mass of trees and underwood. We could see the\r\npoor beast's legs kicking in the air, but it was long before we could\r\nreach her, and more than two hours before a circuitous path could be\r\ncut and cleared away to extricate her. We encamped on the pajonal, and\r\nnext day, after a very laborious walk of twelve hours, we reached the\r\nYpara tambo, in the valley of Sandia, Mr. Weir having collected twenty\r\nplants of _Calisaya Josephiana_ on the way. On May 14th we continued\r\nour journey towards Sandia, and collected fifty-five more plants\r\nof _Calisaya Josephiana_ on the pajonal of Paccay-samana, chiefly\r\nseedlings.\r\n\r\nThe water of the numerous cascades is very refreshing, and as beautiful\r\nin its limpid transparency as when it dashes down the rocks in dazzling\r\nstreams of purest white. We were now too in the land of luscious\r\noranges and chirimoyas. The commonest bird in the valley of Sandia is\r\nthe _cuchu_, a kind of large crow, with a shrill weak caw. It has a\r\nlong yellow bill, greenish-brown body and wings, rump-feathers red,\r\nand a long bright yellow tail, with a black line down the centre. The\r\n_cuchus_ walk about the fields eating the young maize, and perch upon\r\nthe adjoining trees. Humming-birds are numerous, and very beautiful; I\r\nsaw also a little cream-coloured hawk, and lordly eagles were soaring\r\nover the ravine, having their eyries in the inaccessible parts of the\r\nlofty cliffs. Approaching Sandia in the early morning of May 15th, I\r\ncame upon many groups of Indians, with their wives and daughters, who\r\nhad slept in the road, on their way to and from their coca-harvests.\r\nThey were boiling their breakfasts of potatoes over little fires of\r\ndry sticks, which crackled pleasantly. Grand precipices towered up\r\non either side of the valley, and in the bottom, where the bright\r\nriver was murmuring on its way, there was a hut in a field of maize,\r\nsurrounded by the drooping crimson flowers of the \"love-lies-bleeding,\"\r\nwith a girl in a bright blue woollen dress sitting at the door.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Sandia I went through the ceremony of paying off my\r\nIndians, and taking leave; and Vilca, Ccuri, and Quispi returned to\r\ntheir homes. I formed a very high opinion of the Indian character\r\nfrom my experience with these my fellow-labourers. Suspicious they\r\ncertainly were at times, and with good reason after the treatment\r\nthey have usually met with from white men, but willing, hard-working,\r\nintelligent, good-humoured, always ready to help each other, quick in\r\nforming the encampments, conversing quietly and without noise round the\r\ncamp-fires, and always kind to animals; altogether very efficient and\r\ncompanionable people.\r\n\r\nI found things at Sandia in a very alarming state; most of the people\r\nhad been excited by letters from Quiaca to prevent me from continuing\r\nmy journey with the chinchona-plants, and a sort of league had been\r\nmade with other _Juntas Municipales_ to protect their interests, and\r\nprevent foreigners from injuring them. The tactics which were adopted\r\nwould have succeeded in their object, but for a great piece of good\r\nluck. I was prevented from hiring mules, except to go to Crucero, where\r\nI knew Martel was stationed, with the intention of raising obstacles\r\nto my further progress until the plants had been killed by the frost.\r\nI was in despair, and meditated setting out on foot, with all the\r\nfour bundles of plants on my own mule, when Don Manuel Mena told me\r\nconfidentially that, if I would give him my gun, he would get an Indian\r\nto supply beasts, and accompany me to Vilque, on the road to Arequipa.\r\nI willingly agreed to this bargain, and sent Mr. Weir and Pablo to\r\nCrucero, so as to throw Martel off the scent, while I hurried the\r\nplants down to the coast by the most unfrequented line of country.\r\n\r\nAn alarm had, however, been spread through all the villages bordering\r\non the chinchona forests, both in Caravaya and Bolivia, and I\r\nascertained that effectual measures had been taken to prevent my\r\nreturn for seeds in August. Martel had also written to the towns and\r\nvillages between Crucero and Arequipa, to put obstacles in the way of\r\nmy retreat, so that I found it necessary to avoid entering any town\r\nor village, and to shape a direct compass-course over the cordilleras\r\nfrom Sandia to Vilque. I also reluctantly abandoned my intention of\r\nreturning to collect seeds in August, and made the best arrangements in\r\nmy power to obtain a supply, through a reliable agent, in the ensuing\r\nyear. Martel was a mischievous meddling fellow, but the members of\r\nthe _Juntas Municipales_ may have been influenced by misguided zeal\r\nfor the interests of their country, and for the preservation of a\r\nstrict monopoly in a trade which has ceased to exist, for no bark is\r\nnow-exported from Caravaya.\r\n\r\nIn the morning of May 17th I left Sandia on my own trusty mule,\r\ndriving two others with the plants before me, and accompanied by\r\ntheir owner on foot, an Indian named Angelino Paco, a middle-aged\r\nrespectable-looking man, who had been one of the Alcaldes of Sandia\r\nin 1859. Mr. Weir started for Arequipa on the same day, by way of\r\nCrucero. Passing through Cuyo-cuyo without stopping, I continued to\r\nascend a mountain-gorge, by the side of the stream, but Paco had never\r\nbeen out of the valley of Sandia before, and was useless as a guide.\r\nAll along the banks of the stream there were square pools dammed up\r\nand filled with heaps of potatoes and ocas, placed there to freeze\r\ninto _chuñus_, the principal food of the Indians when in the forests,\r\nor on the coffee or coca estates. Higher up the gorge all signs of\r\nhabitation cease, though there are still abandoned tiers of ancient\r\nterraces, and the mountain scenery is quite magnificent. Night coming\r\non without a moon, I halted under a splendid range of frowning black\r\ncliffs, and succeeded in pitching the tent in the dark, but there\r\nwas no fuel, and on opening the leathern bag I found that my little\r\nstock of food and lucifer-matches had been stolen in Sandia. I was\r\nthus entirely dependent for existence on Paco's parched maize, which\r\nproved uncommonly hard fare. The cold was intense during the night, and\r\npenetrated through the tent and clothes to the very marrow.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak Paco and I loaded the mules, and continued to ascend the\r\ngorge by the side of the river of Sandia, which becomes a noisy little\r\nrill, and finally falls, as a thin silvery cascade, over a black\r\ncliff. Reaching the summit of the snowy cordillera of Caravaya, we\r\ncommenced the journey over lofty grass-covered plains, where the ground\r\nwas covered with stiff white frost. There were flocks of vicuñas on\r\nthe plain, and _huallatas_, large white geese with brown wings and\r\nred legs, on the banks of the streams; but as we advanced even these\r\nsigns of life ceased, and, when night closed in, I looked round on\r\nthe desolate scene, and thought that to make a direct cut across the\r\ncordilleras to Vilque by compass-course was a very disagreeable way of\r\ntravelling, though, in this case, a necessary one. I had been eleven\r\nhours in the saddle, when Paco found an abandoned shepherd's hut, built\r\nof loose stones, three feet high, and thatched with _ychu_ grass. The\r\nminimum thermometer, during the night, was as low as 20° Fahr. by my\r\nside.\r\n\r\nAt daylight on May 19th Paco complained of having to rise before the\r\nsun, although he must have been half-frozen. The mules had escaped, and\r\nwe were fully three hours in catching them. The ground was covered with\r\na crisp frost, and during the forenoon we were traveling over the same\r\nlofty wilderness, consisting of grassy undulating hills, with ridges\r\nof cliffs, and huge boulders here and there. The view was bounded on\r\nthe north and east by the splendid snowy peaks of the Caravayan range,\r\nand to the north-west by those of Vilcañota. The only living things, in\r\nthese wild solitudes, are the graceful _vicuñas_, which peered at us\r\nwith their long necks from behind the grassy slopes, the _guanacos_,\r\nthe _biscaches_ burrowing amongst the rocks, and the _huallatas_ or\r\nlarge geese on the margins of streams or pools of water.\r\n\r\nAt about noon we began to descend a rocky dangerous cuesta, where there\r\nwas much trouble with the mules, which were constantly attempting to\r\nlie down and roll with the plants. The steep descent led into the\r\nplain of Putina, which was covered with flocks of sheep, with small\r\nfarms, shaded by clumps of _queñua_-trees, nestling under the sandstone\r\ncliffs which bound the plain. Crossing another range, we reached a\r\nswampy plain, with sheep and cattle scattered over it, and stopped at\r\nan abandoned shepherd's hut, the exact counterpart of last night's\r\nlodging. I had been ten hours in the saddle, and was faint from hunger,\r\nbut had to go supperless to bed. Paco was nearly breaking down from a\r\nbad wound in his foot, but I bandaged it with lint, and he was able to\r\nproceed. He had an _alco_ or Peruvian dog with him, which was devotedly\r\nattached to its master. These dogs are something like Newfoundlands,\r\nonly much smaller, generally black or white, and seldom bark.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow the way, for the first two hours, led over grassy\r\nhills covered with flocks of sheep, with shepherd-lads playing on\r\n_pincullus_, or flutes, the sound of which came floating pleasantly\r\non the air, from every direction far and near. We passed several\r\nblue mountain-lakes, with islands of rushes, and many ducks. From\r\n10 A.M. until sunset the whole day was occupied in crossing a vast\r\nplain covered with sheep and cattle, and just after sunset we reached\r\na small _estancia_ or sheep-farm. It was occupied by a large family\r\nof good-tempered Indians, whose eyes glistened when I offered them a\r\n_cesto_ of coca which I had with me, in exchange for unlimited supplies\r\nof milk and cheese. It was pleasant to see their happiness at the\r\nacquisition of this treasure, which was shared by the children and\r\ndogs. The place was full of guinea-pigs, which are considered great\r\ndelicacies. The extreme hunger from which I had suffered since leaving\r\nSandia was here relieved by plenty of milk, cheese, and parched maize.\r\nEvery night I had wrapped the Russian mats, which enveloped the plants,\r\nin warm ponchos, and the tent. The crooked wriggling queñua-branches,\r\nwhich formed the roof of the hut, looked like snakes in the dim light\r\nafter sunset.\r\n\r\nAt sunrise on May 21st there was a white frost, and the deep blue sky\r\nwas without a single cloud. Suddenly an immense flock of flamingos,\r\ncalled _parihuanas_[346] in Quichua, rose in a long column from the\r\nmargin of the river of Azangaro, which flows through the plain. These\r\nbirds, with their crimson wings, and rose-coloured necks and bodies,\r\nwhirring up in a long spiral column, formed one of the most beautiful\r\nsights I ever saw.\r\n\r\nCrossing a range of rocky hills, we entered a plain, which extended to\r\nthe banks of a large lake, with the little town of Arapa built along\r\nthe shore. Dark mountains rise up immediately in the rear. I believe\r\nthat I am the first English traveller who has ever visited this lake,\r\nand M. de Castelnau, who obtained some information respecting it at\r\nPuno, says that it is not to be found in any map.[347] Along the\r\nshores there were long rows of flamingos, standing like a gigantic\r\nregiment, with a few skirmishers thrown out fishing. There were also\r\n_huallatas_, ibises, ducks, and a stout-built stunted sort of crane.\r\nJourneying on, we began to cross a vast plain which extends for many\r\nleagues round the north-west corner of lake Titicaca, and is dotted\r\nwith walled _estancias_ and flocks of sheep. At length we reached the\r\nford over the river of Azangaro, in sight of the little village of\r\nAchaya, to the left. The water came above the mules' bellies, and,\r\ncrossing half a mile of swampy ground, we came to another ford over\r\nthe river of Pucara. The two rivers, uniting just below Achaya, form\r\nthe Ramiz, the largest feeder of lake Titicaca. We continued our way\r\nfor many hours over the plain, until we reached an Indian's hut long\r\nafter dark, having been twelve hours in the saddle, at the slow tedious\r\npace of a tired mule. The cargo-mules had played every kind of vicious\r\ntrick throughout the day, running off in different directions at every\r\nopportunity, and constantly trying to roll.\r\n\r\nStarting at daybreak on the 22nd, we forded the river of Lampa, crossed\r\nthe road between Lampa and Puno, passed over a rocky cordillera and\r\na wide plain, and reached the little town of Vilque by four in the\r\nafternoon. The place presented a very different appearance from the\r\ntime when we passed through it in March, on our way to Puno. It was\r\nnow the time of the great yearly fair, when buyers and sellers from\r\nevery part of South America flock to the little _sierra_ town. This\r\ngreat gathering was first established in the time of the Spaniards, and\r\nit is not improbable that the Jesuits, who once possessed the great\r\nsheep-farm of Yanarico near Vilque, and who always looked well after\r\nthe improvement of their property, may have been the great promoters of\r\nthe fair.\r\n\r\nOutside the town there were thousands of mules from Tucuman waiting for\r\nPeruvian arrieros to buy them. In the plaza were booths full of every\r\ndescription of Manchester and Birmingham goods; in more retired places\r\nwere gold-dust and coffee from Caravaya, silver from the mines, bark\r\nand chocolate from Bolivia, Germans with glass-ware and woollen knitted\r\nwork, French modistes, Italians, Quichua and Aymara Indians in their\r\nvarious picturesque costumes--in fact, all nations and tongues. In the\r\nplaza, too, there were excellent cafés and dining-rooms, all under\r\ncanvas; but house-rent was exorbitant, and a lodging was not to be had\r\nfor love or money. There was much complaint of the injury done to trade\r\nby the threatened war with Bolivia, and the edict of President Linares,\r\nprohibiting all intercourse with Peru.\r\n\r\nI placed the bundles of plants, carefully wrapped round with ponchos,\r\nin a barley-field occupied by arrieros, covered over with their warm\r\n_aparejos_; but the thermometer was down to 23° Fahr. in the night.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of the 23rd I left Vilque for the sheep-farm of\r\nTaya-taya, in company with Dr. Don Camillo Chaves the superintendent.\r\nThe road was crowded with people coming from Arequipa to the fair\r\nat Vilque: native shopkeepers, English merchants coming to arrange\r\nfor their supplies of wool, and a noisy company of arrieros on their\r\nway to buy mules, and armed to the teeth with horse-pistols, old\r\nguns, and huge daggers, to defend their money-bags. Many of them were\r\ngood-looking fellows, the older ones bearing signs of hard drinking.\r\n\r\nThe sheep-farm of Taya-taya,[348] four leagues from Vilque, is a large\r\nrange of mud-plastered buildings with thatched roofs, built round\r\na large _patio_, on a bleak plain surrounded by mountains. In the\r\nmorning a flock of forty llamas were being laden with packs of wool in\r\nthe patio, at which they were making bitter lamentations. We started\r\nearly on May 24th, and encountered a cold gale of wind, blowing in\r\nicy squalls over the cordillera. I reached the posthouse of Cuevillas\r\nin the night, a distance of 45 miles; got as far as the posthouse of\r\nPati the next day; encountered a tremendous gale of wind on the skirts\r\nof the volcano of Arequipa, but descended to the valley of Cangallo\r\non the 26th; and rode into the city of Arequipa, with my plants, on\r\nthe morning of the 27th of May. Mr. Weir arrived from Crucero on the\r\n29th, having, as I expected, found Martel in that town, whose designs\r\nwere thus baffled. From Sandia to Arequipa is a distance of nearly 300\r\nmiles. No opposition was made to my departure from Arequipa, although\r\nthe local newspaper had something to say afterwards,[349] and on June\r\n1st the plants were safely deposited by the Wardian cases at the port\r\nof Islay.\r\n\r\n\"John of the Fountain\" had provided plenty of soil, and by the 3rd all\r\nthe plants were established in the Wardian cases by Mr. Weir. But the\r\ndifficulties of getting the plants out of the country were not entirely\r\nended by my escape from Martel and the _Juntas Municipales_ of the\r\ninterior. The Superintendent of the custom-house of Islay declared it\r\nto be illegal to export cascarilla-plants, and refused to allow them\r\nto be shipped without an express order from the Minister of Finance\r\nand Commerce at Lima. He had probably received intelligence respecting\r\nthe contents of the cases from Vilque, where all news centres at the\r\ntime of the fair. This obliged me to go to Lima to obtain the necessary\r\norder from Colonel Salcedo, the Minister of Finance, which, after much\r\ndifficulty, I succeeded in doing, and returned with it to Islay on June\r\n23rd.[350]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, since the plants had been established in the Wardian cases,\r\nthey had begun to bud and throw out young leaves, which seemed to prove\r\nthat they had quite recovered from their journey across the arctic\r\nclimate of the Andes. In the evening of the 23rd the cases were hoisted\r\ninto a launch, ready to go on board the steamer on the following\r\nmorning; and during the night attempts were made to bribe the man in\r\ncharge to bore holes and kill the plants by pouring in boiling water,\r\nbut without success. On the following day they were safely lodged on\r\nboard the steamer bound for Panama.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible not to feel regret that H. M. steamer 'Vixen,' then\r\nlying idle at Callao, had not been ordered to take the plants direct\r\nacross the Pacific to Madras, when a majority would have arrived in\r\nperfect order. But this was not to be, and we had to look forward to\r\nlong voyages, several trans-shipments, and the intense heat of the Red\r\nSea, before this most valuable collection of plants could reach their\r\ndestination in Southern India.\r\n\r\nYet it could not but be satisfactory to look back upon the\r\nextraordinary difficulties we had overcome, the hardships and dangers\r\nof the forests, the scarcity of the plants, the bewildering puzzle to\r\nfind them amidst the dense underwood, the endeavour to stop my journey\r\nfirst at Tambopata and then in Sandia, the rapid flight across unknown\r\nparts of the cordillera, and the attempts first to stop and then to\r\ndestroy the plants at Islay: it was a source of gratification to look\r\nback upon all this, and then to see the great majority of the plants\r\nbudding and looking healthy in the Wardian cases.\r\n\r\nThe climate at Islay, during the time that the plants remained there,\r\nwas as follows, from the 1st to the 24th of June:--\r\n\r\n  Mean temperature                69° Fahr.\r\n  Mean minimum at night           60\r\n  Highest temperature observed    73\r\n  Lowest                          58\r\n  Entire range                    15\r\n\r\nThe temperature is almost exactly the same as that of the Tambopata\r\nforests in May; but the forests were always exceedingly moist, while\r\nIslay is intensely dry. This, however, was unimportant to the plants in\r\ntheir cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nPRESENT CONDITION AND FUTURE PROSPECTS OF PERU.\r\n\r\n  Population--Civil wars--Government--Constitution--General\r\n  Castilla and his ministers--Dr. Vigil--Mariano Paz\r\n  Soldan--Valleys on the coast--Cotton, wool, and specie--The\r\n  Amazons--Guano--Finances--Literature--Future prospects.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER a sojourn of a few days at Lima we took a final farewell of the\r\nland of the Incas, on June 29th, 1860. As we steamed along the coast,\r\nin sight of the emerald-green valleys, surrounded by trackless wastes\r\nof sand, and of the glorious cordilleras which towered up behind them,\r\na long train of memories passed in array before us. In this land\r\nalone, of all the nations of the earth, did the ideal of a perfect\r\npatriarchal form of government become a reality. Here, too, are the\r\nscenes of the most romantic episode in modern history, comprised in the\r\ncareer of the Pizarros. The sufferings of the gentle Indians excited\r\nthe indignation of the Elizabethan chivalry; the fabulous riches\r\nextracted from the mines of Peru attracted the adventurous spirit of\r\nthe buccaneers of a baser age; and the brave struggle for independence\r\nled more than one gallant Englishman to shed his blood in the cause of\r\nPeruvian liberty.[351] What is now the state of this famous land, and\r\nwhat prospect is there of the glowing hopes expressed in Mr. Canning's\r\nwell-known speech ever being fulfilled, are questions which cannot fail\r\nto arouse some passing interest.\r\n\r\nIn giving an account of the present condition and future prospects of\r\nPeru, the invariable kindness and frank hospitality of its inhabitants\r\nimpose an obligation to speak with as much leniency and forbearance\r\nas the interests of truth will admit. The South American Republics\r\nare peopled by races of mixed origin, who are doubtless inferior to\r\nEuropeans, both mentally and physically; and the unsettled condition\r\nof those countries, which inevitably succeeded the struggles for an\r\nindependence for which the people were unprepared, has continued longer\r\nthan might justly have been expected. But it appears to be a generally\r\nreceived idea in England, originating from the accounts of travellers\r\nunacquainted with the people, and ignorant of their language, that the\r\nSouth Americans are a mongrel degraded race, incapable of improvement,\r\nand hopelessly degenerate.[352] So far as my experience extends, and\r\nafter a careful consideration of the subject, I can see no grounds for\r\nresigning the hope that a brighter future is yet in store for the land\r\nof the Incas.\r\n\r\nIt is true that, after a casual and superficial glance at the state\r\nof affairs in South America since the expulsion of the Spaniards, the\r\nprospect appears sufficiently gloomy. But a more intimate acquaintance\r\nwith the subject, and especially a knowledge of the tone of thought\r\namongst the younger men, as expressed in conversation and in their\r\nwritings, would show that, under the surface, noble aspirations and\r\nsteady enlightened views prevail, which must eventually yield fruit,\r\nand thus justify our hopes for the future. When independence was\r\nestablished in South America, there were two principal causes which led\r\nto the civil wars which ensued; namely, the question between a federal\r\nor a centralized form of government, and the disputes respecting\r\nboundaries. The power attained during the revolution by the armies, and\r\nthe selfish ambition, treason, and corruption of public men, aggravated\r\nthese sources of evil to a melancholy extent. But other countries,\r\nfar greater and nobler than these poor struggling republics, have had\r\nto pass through as long and as degrading a crisis in their history.\r\nEnglishmen must remember the thirty years comprising the reigns of the\r\ntwo last Stuarts with quite as much shame as the great-grandchildren of\r\nthe present Peruvians will experience when they learn the history of\r\ntheir country for the first forty years after its independence. It is\r\nrecorded that in a British House of Commons there was but one Andrew\r\nMarvel. To my personal knowledge there are now several Andrew Marvels\r\nin Chile and Peru. These young and inexperienced countries have had to\r\npass through a fierce ordeal, and, truth to say, they have played their\r\npart but indifferently as yet. They indeed require forbearance, but let\r\nus not turn from them with disdain and contempt, in the pride of our\r\npresent grandeur and prosperity. Were treason and corruption and base\r\nselfish faction never rife in England's court and parliament?\r\n\r\nThe fatal mistake of several of the old Spanish colonies was in\r\nestablishing a federal system of government, in imitation of the United\r\nStates. This was the case in Mexico, Central America, New Granada, and\r\nthe Argentine Confederation. No system can possibly be more entirely\r\nunsuited to a thinly-peopled mountainous region, without roads, and\r\nunprovided with a sufficient number of capable educated men in the\r\ndistant provinces to undertake the local government. Power necessarily\r\nfalls into the hands of any cunning adventurer, every little state\r\nbecomes a focus for revolution, and an endless succession of civil wars\r\nare the result. Such, in fact, has been the fate of those republics\r\nwhere federation has been established. Pernicious as centralization\r\nalways is when carried too far in old and densely-peopled countries,\r\nit is an absolute necessity in young states, with a small population\r\nthinly scattered over a vast extent of country. The distant\r\ninaccessible districts do not possess the materials for self-government\r\nwithin themselves, and necessarily depend for their prosperity and\r\nadvancement on the capital.\r\n\r\nPeru has only once been subjected to the federal experiment, and she\r\nhas not suffered so much from internal dissensions as the unfortunate\r\ncountries above mentioned. She holds a central position amongst the\r\nSouth American republics, not so cruelly torn by anarchy as Mexico on\r\nthe one hand, and not enjoying so good and settled a government as\r\nChile on the other. Her people too are perhaps inferior in capacity and\r\nmental endowments to the Chilians and the natives of New Granada, but\r\ninfinitely superior to those of Central America and Mexico. She may,\r\ntherefore, be taken as an average example of these half Spanish, half\r\nIndian states; and as such I will proceed to give some account of her\r\npeople, her government, and her material resources.\r\n\r\nThe population of Peru, by the latest accounts, was 1,880,000 souls:\r\nthe whole of the labouring classes in the interior being pure Indians;\r\nthe artizans and shopkeeping classes in the towns partly Indians and\r\npartly half-castes or mestizos; the lower orders on the coast being\r\nnegros, or zambos, a caste between negros and Indians, with some\r\nimported Chinese; and the upper classes being chiefly of Spanish\r\ndescent with a slight dash of Indian blood, many nearly or quite\r\nhalf-castes, not a few pure Indian, and an exceedingly small proportion\r\nof pure Spanish descent.[353] The men of Indian extraction display\r\nperhaps more energy and equal ability with their fellow-countrymen of\r\npure Spanish origin; and many Indians are wealthy enterprising men,\r\nwhile others have held the highest offices in the state. The Peruvians\r\nare intelligent and quick of apprehension, exceedingly hospitable\r\nand kind-hearted, and remarkably humane and forgiving, as a rule, in\r\nthe conduct of their civil wars; but they are apt to be fickle and\r\nvolatile, incapable of any long-sustained effort, and inclined to\r\nindolence. Corruption, bribery, treason, and pusillanimity are but\r\ntoo common; but may not these be the vices engendered by civil strife\r\nand periods of anarchy, rather than the normal characteristics of the\r\npeople? With the exception of the negro races on the coast, there are\r\nfew people among whom crime is more uncommon.\r\n\r\nThe causes of the civil and foreign wars which have retarded the\r\nprogress of Peru since her independence may be explained in a very few\r\nsentences.\r\n\r\nThe first of these has arisen from disputes with her neighbours\r\nrespecting boundaries. On her southern frontier the ambitious policy\r\nof Bolivar created a small republic, from no reason or motive that\r\nwas apparent, beyond the childish vanity of having a country called\r\nafter his name. This country was to all intents and purposes a part of\r\nPeru. Her people, her languages, her traditions and feelings were the\r\nsame, and, until the latter part of the last century, she had formed\r\na part of the Peruvian viceroyalty. No good end was attained by this\r\ndivision; while disputes respecting a doubtful unsurveyed boundary,\r\njealousies and misunderstandings arising from all imported goods\r\nfrom Europe having to be landed at the Peruvian port of Arica, and\r\nconveyed to Bolivia across Peruvian territory, has created a hostile\r\nfeeling, embittered year by year, between people who should have lived\r\nas brothers under a single government. On her northern frontier Peru\r\nhas the little republic of Ecuador, until 1830 a portion of Colombia;\r\nwhich possesses the only good port, with the exception of Callao, on\r\nthe western coast of South America, that of Guayaquil. This port has\r\nalways been coveted by Peru; and the question of the frontier was\r\nfurther confused by the civil jurisdiction in Peru and Quito, during\r\nSpanish times, having been divided by one line, and the ecclesiastical\r\nby another. The generally recognised rule for deciding the frontiers\r\nbetween the South American Republics is the _uti possidetis_, as\r\nregards the former colonial jurisdictions, at the time of the war of\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nThese frontier disputes, carried on with feelings embittered by former\r\njealousies, led to a war between Colombia and Peru in 1828,[354] in\r\nwhich the latter republic was worsted; and a campaign, ending in a\r\ntreaty, between Peru and Bolivia at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe second and more disastrous cause for civil dissensions was the\r\nquestion between a federal and a centralized form of republican\r\ngovernment. Peru enjoyed a period of peace between the war with\r\nColombia in 1828 and the year 1834; but between the latter period\r\nand the year 1844 the unfortunate country was subject to a constant\r\nseries of civil wars and insurrections. The ten years between 1834\r\nand 1844 was Peru's most miserable time. Her public men were corrupt,\r\npusillanimous, and selfishly ambitious; she was given up to be torn\r\nand distracted by wretched military adventurers; and the marches of\r\narmies, with their system of forced recruiting, banished all attempts\r\nat advancement or improvement from the country. Yet even during this\r\ndark interval there was a space of two years, when General Santa Cruz\r\nestablished his dream of a federal republic under the name of the\r\nPeru-Bolivian Confederation, during which the land enjoyed peace and\r\nsome signs of revived prosperity. The able and vigorous administration\r\nof Santa Cruz, whose mother was an Indian chieftainess, was the one\r\nbright spot in this dreary waste of anarchy.\r\n\r\nFor the following ten years Peru enjoyed a period of peace, under\r\nthe rule of General Don Ramon Castilla, an old Indian of Tarapaca,\r\nfor the first six years, and afterwards of General Echenique. During\r\nthis period the country advanced rapidly in material prosperity, but\r\nin 1854 it was again convulsed by a revolution, caused by the general\r\ndiscontent of the people at the gross malversations and unblushing\r\nrobbery of Echenique's Government. Castilla placed himself at the head\r\nof this movement, and, with the aid of a large army, has retained his\r\npower up to the present day. The insurrection at Arequipa, and mutiny\r\nin the fleet, in 1857-58, were purely local, and did not affect the\r\ngeneral tranquillity of the country.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of Peru's ten years of convulsion, a constitution was\r\nadopted, establishing a strictly centralising form of government, in\r\n1839, in which immense power was placed in the hands of the executive.\r\nBut during the ten years of peace which followed the election of\r\nCastilla in 1844, men's minds were strongly influenced by European\r\ntravel and by more extended reading, extreme liberal views were very\r\ngenerally adopted, and the old constitution was felt to be out of\r\ndate. In 1856, therefore, a new constitution was promulgated by a\r\nnational assembly summoned for the purpose by General Castilla, in\r\nwhich abstract ideas of what is just and right were unhesitatingly\r\nand heedlessly adopted; and a strong tendency to federalism and local\r\nself-government was displayed.\r\n\r\nBy a stroke of the pen the capitation-tax paid by the Indians, the\r\nprincipal source of revenue in ordinary times, the slavery of negros\r\non the coast, and all capital punishments were entirely abolished.\r\nThere would have been some nobleness in the abolition of slavery, and\r\nthe grant of 1,780,000 dollars as compensation, as well as a display\r\nof liberal sentiment, if it had in any way increased the burdens\r\nof the people, but this was not the case. For the same reason the\r\ndiscontinuance of the tribute paid by the Indians was a mere act of\r\nrecklessness. In this constitution there were two legislative chambers,\r\na Senate and a House of Representatives; but half the representatives\r\nwere chosen by lot to form a Senate, so that one chamber was a mere\r\ncounterpart of the other. The most remarkable clauses, however, were\r\nthose in which measures leading to the federal form of government, a\r\nplagiarism of the disastrous system of the United States, were adopted.\r\nPeru continued to be divided into Departments governed by Prefects\r\nappointed by the President; but it was now enacted that in the capital\r\nof each Department there should be a sort of state legislature called\r\na _Junta Departmental_, the members being elected by the people, and\r\nempowered to deliberate and legislate for the good of the Department.\r\nThis measure was but a commencement of that fatal system which had\r\nconvulsed some of the other republics; and its tendency was so apparent\r\nthat Castilla was accused of intending to divide Peru into a dozen\r\npetty states, and to rule as a Dictator, by fomenting dissensions\r\namong them.[355] A wiser and more useful measure was the establishment\r\nof what are called _Juntas Municipales_ in the towns and unions of\r\nvillages, composed of the principal residents, who are intrusted with\r\nthe supervision and promotion of all local interests and improvements.\r\n\r\nIn November 1860 this constitution was reformed, improvements were\r\nintroduced, and some of its more absurd and injurious provisions\r\nwere repealed. Capital punishment for the crime of murder was again\r\nenacted. The Congress was to meet every two years on the 28th of July;\r\na third of their number to be renewed every two years; and, during the\r\nrecess, a permanent committee of the Congress, consisting of seven\r\nsenators and eight deputies, to be elected at the end of each session,\r\nwas to watch the execution of acts passed by the Congress, and to\r\nexercise its functions. A great improvement was also adopted in the\r\nconstitution of the Senate. The members of that body are to be elected\r\nby the Departments, each one electing a certain number according to the\r\nnumber of its provinces, and the qualification of a senator is raised\r\nto 1000 dollars a-year. Thus there is now an intelligible difference\r\nbetween the two chambers, and, in the formation of the Senate, one of\r\nthe few good points of the constitution of the United States has been\r\nwisely adopted. The executive power is in the hands of a President\r\nand two Vice-Presidents elected for four years, and a council of\r\nministers. Finally the mischievous _Juntas Departmentales_, which I\r\nbelieve had never been allowed to meet, were abolished, while the\r\nmunicipal institutions of the constitution of 1856, which could only be\r\nproductive of good, remained in full force.\r\n\r\nSuch is the present form of government in Peru, perhaps as good a one\r\nas the country is fit for, and capable, in firm and honest hands,\r\nof meeting all the present requirements of the people; but it is of\r\nmore importance to know in whose hands the government of the country\r\nis placed, and what manner of men are intrusted with the destinies\r\nof a country so rich in memories of the past, as well as in material\r\nresources; a young republic still bleeding at every pore from a series\r\nof civil wars, yet with a growing desire to struggle up, through shame\r\nand misfortune, to a respectable place among the nations. I will give a\r\nfew hasty sketches of the men who formed the executive power during my\r\nstay at Lima in 1860.\r\n\r\nGeneral Ramon Castilla, the President, is a native of Tarapaca in the\r\nextreme south of Peru, and must now be close upon seventy years of age.\r\nHe is the son of Pedro Castilla, who worked the refuse silver-ores of\r\nthe mines of El Carmen,[356] and young Ramon acted as his father's\r\n_leñatero_, or woodcutter. He, afterwards, entered the Spanish army,\r\nand on the arrival of the patriot forces from Chile in 1821 he joined\r\ntheir cause, and attained the rank of colonel. After the independence\r\nhe was appointed Sub-prefect of his native province of Tarapaca, in\r\n1826; and he was Prefect of Puno from 1834 to 1836; but he was mixed up\r\nin all the civil wars, and, after a victory gained by him in 1844, he\r\nwas elected President of the Republic. Castilla is a small spare man,\r\nwith an iron constitution, and great powers of endurance. His bright\r\nfierce little eyes, with overhanging brows, stiff bristly moustaches,\r\nand projecting under lip, give his countenance a truculent expression,\r\nwhich is not improved by a leathery dried-up complexion; but he has a\r\nlook of resolution and an air of command which is almost dignified.\r\nThis remarkable man is an excellent soldier, brave as a lion, prompt\r\nin action, and beloved by his men. Uneducated and illiterate, his\r\npolitical successes and management of parties almost amount to\r\ngenius, while his victories have never been stained by cruelty, and\r\nhis antagonists have seldom been proscribed for any length of time,\r\ngenerally pardoned at once, and often raised by him to posts of\r\nimportance in the service of the Republic. His firm and vigorous grasp\r\nof power has secured for Peru long periods of peace; faction has been\r\nkept under, while an incalculable blessing has thus been conferred on\r\nthe country; and probably no other man had the ability and the nerve\r\nto effect this. But Castilla, though a necessity, has been a necessary\r\nevil. His want of education renders him useless as a statesman. He\r\nhas generally shown himself indifferent to all public works, and to\r\nmeasures for the moral or material benefit of the country, while\r\nhe insists on keeping up an enormous standing army, and on spending\r\nuntold sums on a costly navy, thus squandering the public money, and\r\ncontinuing a pernicious and ruinous system. The brave old man has been\r\na necessity. He alone has been able to keep the peace, and give time\r\nto the Peruvians slowly to develop the resources of their country;\r\nand through this period of tranquillity, when he shall have passed\r\naway, interests and influences may have insensibly risen up, which\r\nwill prevent the recurrence of such periods of anarchy as preceded\r\nCastilla's first accession to power.\r\n\r\nJuan Manuel del Mar, the first Vice-President, a tall, sallow,\r\nearnest-looking man, is a native of Cuzco, the old capital of the\r\nIncas. He has held office for some years, and has more than once been\r\nin supreme command during the absence of Castilla. This statesman was\r\ncalled to the bar in 1830, and has led an active public life as deputy\r\nto Congress, judge, or minister ever since. He is thoroughly honest,\r\npossessed of enlightened views and some ability, very popular, and\r\nuniversally and deservedly respected.\r\n\r\nThe second Vice-President, elected under the provisions of the reformed\r\nconstitution of 1860, is General Pezet, the son of a physician of\r\nFrench extraction, who died in Callao Castle when it was held by the\r\nSpaniards, and stood a long siege. General Pezet, a native of Lima,\r\njoined the patriot ranks when they landed in Peru in 1821, then only\r\neleven years of age; and was at once sent on active service. Thus he\r\nwas present at the battles of Junin and Ayacucho, which destroyed the\r\nSpanish power, and was mixed up in the subsequent civil wars.\r\n\r\nCastilla's ministers, at the time of my visit, were far from\r\nrepresenting the most able and distinguished class of Peruvians.\r\nColonel Salcedo, the Minister of Finance, a native of Lampa, was born\r\nin 1801. He was one of the few members of Congress who, in 1824,\r\nfirmly opposed and defeated the ambitious designs of Bolivar; and he\r\nhas since almost constantly served as sub-prefect or prefect, or as\r\na member of Congress. Another minister was Don José Fabio Melgar,\r\na brother of the famous poet of Arequipa, whose melancholy death I\r\nhave already mentioned. He has served as chief clerk in one or other\r\nof the public offices since 1833, is an amiable man, well read, and\r\nintelligent, but with only moderate abilities, and no originality or\r\nforce of will. The minister of Foreign Affairs was Don Miguel del\r\nCarpio, a veteran statesman, born in 1795, and who, having joined the\r\npatriots and been taken prisoner by the Spaniards in 1822, was long\r\nkept in prison, and heavily chained. Since the independence he has held\r\nimportant offices both in Bolivia and Peru.\r\n\r\nBut old Castilla requires obedient clerks around him, not independent\r\nministers, and the more able and active-minded Peruvians are not to\r\nbe found filling high political posts. The best specimens of the\r\nnatives of Peru are either to be met with leading unobtrusive literary\r\nlives, and preparing for better times; or on their estates actively\r\nand energetically developing the resources of their country. Such men\r\nare Mariategui, Felipe Pardo, Vigil, Paz Soldan, and Elias, whose\r\npatriotism and great ability would do honour to any country.\r\n\r\nDr. Vigil is one of Peru's most distinguished sons. In early life\r\nhe was an active and eloquent member of Congress; subsequently he\r\nwas engaged on one of the most learned, as well as the most liberal\r\nworks that a Roman Catholic clergyman has ever ventured to publish on\r\nthe Papacy; and now in his old age he continues to advocate, in his\r\nforcible writings, every cause and every measure which is intended to\r\nadvance religious freedom, or the moral well-being of his countrymen.\r\nDr. Vigil fears that liberal views on religious subjects, such as\r\ntoleration, the marriage of the clergy, and independence of Rome,\r\ncannot be expected to make any rapid progress at present, but he\r\nis confident that a future generation will appreciate his works,\r\nand introduce the measures which he advocates. One of his strongest\r\nconvictions is that priests will never lead virtuous lives until they\r\nare humanized by family ties: and that, while now they live for the\r\nChurch--that is for themselves and their order--they ought to live for\r\ntheir flocks.\r\n\r\nWhile the learned and amiable Vigil represents the literary men of\r\nPeru, Mariano Paz Soldan is one of the best specimens of the men of\r\naction. His benevolent mind was shocked at the wretched condition\r\nof the prisons in Peru, and he has displayed an amount of energy\r\nand ability in endeavouring to remedy this evil which goes far to\r\nvindicate the Peruvian character from the charge of indolence and\r\nprocrastination. In 1853 Paz Soldan published a very able and detailed\r\nreport on the prisons of the United States; and in 1856, by dint of\r\nunceasing representations, he obtained the necessary grant from the\r\nGovernment for the erection of a penitentiary on the most improved\r\nprinciple at Lima. The work was at once commenced with vigour. The\r\nfoundations, basement, and first story are built of a very hard\r\nporphyritic stone, brought from the hills about two miles from Lima,\r\nwhere a quarry was opened for the first time by Paz Soldan, with a\r\ntramroad direct to the works. The entrance is by a flight of four\r\nsteps, cut out of a single block of this porphyritic rock. The second\r\nstory is of brick, and all the iron for gratings, doors, bolts, and\r\nroofing came out ready made from England. The wards for men, women, and\r\nchildren are separated, each with its large well-ventilated workroom,\r\nexercising yard, and cells; and everything is arranged on the best\r\nEnglish and American models. It will hold 52 women, 52 boys, and 208\r\nmen. This great public work will be a credit to the country, and a\r\nlasting monument of the energy and perseverance of its projector, who\r\ntrusts that it will be but the first of a series of such penitentiaries\r\nin different parts of the country. Don Mariano Paz Soldan is also\r\nengaged in organizing a general topographical survey of Peru.\r\n\r\nThere are many landed proprietors and others, of Paz Soldan's stamp,\r\nwho have availed themselves of the period of tranquillity since 1844,\r\ninterrupted only by one year of revolution, to improve their estates,\r\nand thus add to their country's wealth, especially in the valleys on\r\nthe coast. The long slip of land between the Andes and the Pacific\r\nOcean enjoys an equable climate, rain and heavy storms are nearly\r\nunknown, and refreshing dews descend during the night. The greater\r\npart of this region consists of sandy desert, traversed by ridges of\r\nrocky barren hills; but wherever a stream, descending from the Andes,\r\nis of sufficient volume to reach the ocean, a rich and fertile valley\r\nborders its banks. These valleys, of greater or less extent, and at\r\nvarious intervals, break the monotony of the desert from the bay of\r\nGuayaquil to the river Loa, which separates Peru from Bolivia. They are\r\nadmirably adapted for the cultivation of cotton, the vine, the olive,\r\nand sugar-cane.\r\n\r\nImmense wealth is already derived from these valleys, and, with\r\njudicious outlay for obtaining more regular supplies of water, their\r\ncapabilities might be multiplied indefinitely. The valley of Cañete,\r\nsouth of Lima, which is in the hands of six enterprising proprietors,\r\nis covered with sugar-cane plantations. In 1860 it yielded sugar\r\nworth 1,000,000 dollars, all raised by Chinese and free negro labour.\r\nFurther south, the valleys of Pisco and Yca, thanks chiefly to Don\r\nDomingo Elias and his sons, yield 70,000 _botijas_ of a spirit called\r\npisco, 10,000 barrels of excellent wine, 800,000 lbs. of cotton, and\r\n40,000 lbs. of cochineal. Still further south there are many valleys\r\nwhich render their owners wealthy by the produce of cane-fields and\r\nvineyards, in the departments of Moquegua and Arequipa; and in the\r\nvalley of Tambo, near Arequipa, there are 5000 olive-trees and seven\r\nmills.\r\n\r\nNow that the question of cotton-supply is attracting so large a share\r\nof attention in England, it is gratifying to be able to state that\r\nlanded proprietors on the coast of Peru have seriously turned their\r\nattention to the subject, and that in 1860 the cultivation of cotton\r\nwas becoming a favourite speculation. The soil and climate of these\r\ncoast valleys are admirably adapted for its growth, and, though the\r\nquantity that could be drawn from them would be insignificant when\r\ncompared with the vast demands of Manchester, yet the quality is good,\r\nand they will supply one out of many sources which may hereafter\r\nrender us partially independent of the Confederate States. The estates\r\nof Don Domingo Elias and others, in the valleys of Yca, Palpa, San\r\nXavier, and Nasca, yield 800,000 lbs. of excellent cotton. I visited\r\nthese cotton estates in 1853, and found that the cotton was carefully\r\npicked, and packed by screw presses. A great deal of cotton is also\r\nshipped from the port of Payta, which sells in Liverpool at 8_d._\r\nto 9-1/2_d._ the lb.; and in the valley of Lambayeque,[357] between\r\nPayta and Lima, cotton cultivation has lately been undertaken on a\r\nvery large scale. In 1860, in the four districts of Talambo, Cayalti,\r\nCollus, and Calupe, there were already 600,000 plants in the ground,\r\nand in neighbouring estates extensive tracts of land had been prepared\r\nfor cotton by the house of Zaracondegui and others. At Talambo, in\r\nthe valley of Pacasmayo, there are many Biscayan families, numbering\r\nin all 176 souls, who are exclusively engaged in cotton cultivation;\r\nand the yield in that district in the first year was 800,000 lbs.\r\nIn the province of Chiclayo 700,000 plants were put in the ground\r\nduring 1860, and land was being prepared for the growth of cotton\r\ncrops to a much larger extent. These cotton-growing provinces of\r\nLambayeque, Chiclayo, and Truxillo are fertile and well watered;\r\nstorms of rain are unknown, and they enjoy an equable climate with\r\na mean temperature between 70° and 84° Fahr. It has been calculated\r\nthat, after leaving a fifth of the available land for crops to supply\r\nprovisions for the inhabitants, as many as 140,000 _fanegadas_[358]\r\nmight be brought under cotton cultivation in these provinces alone.\r\nAllowing four feet for each plant, and that each plant yields four\r\npounds a year, this extent of land would produce 580,000,000 lbs. of\r\ncotton annually, worth twelve dollars the cwt. at the port of shipment,\r\nor 69,600,000 dollars. Deducting 22,400,000 for expenses, this would\r\nleave 47,200,000 dollars profit. But these provinces only contain a\r\nsmall fraction of the fertile coast valleys of Peru; and it is clear\r\nthat, if the speculations of 1860 yield a reasonably profitable return,\r\nthe cultivation of cotton may, in all probability, be undertaken\r\nover a vast area, and render Peru an important source of supply for\r\nManchester.[359]\r\n\r\nThe lofty table-lands of the cordillera of the Andes produce\r\nsufficient maize, wheat, and sugar for home consumption; but their\r\nchief exportable wealth is to be found in the vast flocks of sheep and\r\nalpacas which find pasture on those grassy uplands, and in the veins\r\nand washings of silver and gold. About 400,000_l._ worth of wool is\r\nannually exported, of which 5,017,100 lbs., valued at 287,339_l._, were\r\nembarked from the port of Islay in 1859, and 4,214,000 lbs. in 1860.\r\nThe export of specie amounted to about 200,000_l._ in 1859, of which\r\n34,705_l._ were exported from Islay, and 32,000_l._ from Arica. But of\r\nthis a portion is in coined money and _chafalonia_, or old plate.\r\n\r\nBesides the raising of the various valuable products suitable to the\r\ncoast valleys and the _sierra_, the vast forests to the eastward of the\r\nAndes, and the great fluvial highways which flow through them to the\r\nAtlantic, offer an inexhaustible field for Peruvian enterprise. The\r\nincredible resources of this portion of Peru are only now beginning to\r\nbe fully appreciated, though ten, and even twenty years ago, there were\r\nevident symptoms of the first early pulsations of life and commerce\r\non the mighty river Amazons and its tributaries. Petty traders, the\r\npioneers of a stirring future, were then busy, each in his little\r\ntraffic; canoes laden with hammocks, hats, wax, sarsaparilla, copaiba,\r\nand other products of the forest, found their way to Para at the mouth\r\nof the Amazons, and returned with European manufactured goods.\r\n\r\nBut of late years an immense stride in advance has been taken; and in\r\n1857 a Brazilian company was working eight steamers on the Amazons\r\nand its tributaries, conveying passengers, and bearing up and down\r\na ceaseless ebb and flow of commerce. Measures were adopted in 1853\r\nto connect the Brazilian line of steamers with a Peruvian line\r\nnavigating the upper waters, and two small steam-vessels were sent out\r\nfrom New York for the purpose, called the \"Tirado\" and \"Huallaga.\"\r\nThe revolution of 1854 temporarily put a stop to these efforts,\r\nand the two steamers were left to rot at Nauta, 2300 miles up the\r\nAmazons. Latterly, however, steps have again been taken to supply\r\nthe Peruvian tributaries of the Amazons with steam navigation, and\r\nthereby to encourage settlement, attract commerce, and thus develop the\r\nincalculable wealth of Peru's Amazonian provinces.\r\n\r\nIn October 1858 a fluvial convention was signed between Brazil and\r\nPeru, establishing the free navigation of the Amazons, under certain\r\nrestrictions; and in February 1860 the Brazilian steamer 'Tabatinga'\r\narrived at Laguna on the Peruvian river Huallaga, upwards of 3000 miles\r\nfrom the mouth of the Amazons. Meanwhile the Peruvian Government have\r\nordered steamers to be constructed to work on the upper waters of the\r\nAmazons, in conjunction with the Brazilian line; and roads are to be\r\nmade connecting inland towns with the nearest navigable points on the\r\ntributaries of the Amazons. In June 1860 a party of sixty men left the\r\ntown of Huanuco to explore the wide forest-covered plains known as the\r\n\"Pampas del Sacramento\" to the eastward; and in July a road had already\r\nbeen commenced, which is to connect Huanuco with a navigable part of\r\nthe river Ucayali, a distance of 150 miles. A small colony of Germans\r\nhas been established on the river Pozuzu. Other measures of a similar\r\nnature are in contemplation, and it is impossible to estimate the rapid\r\nand certain increase of wealth which will accrue to this hitherto\r\nneglected region, when steam communication has thus brought one of the\r\nrichest regions in the world within reach of a market. Para, at the\r\nmouth of the Amazons, already exceeds, in the number of its staple\r\ncommodities of export, all indigenous to the regions of which it forms\r\nthe outlet, almost any other port on the surface of the globe. My space\r\nwill not allow me to dilate further on this most interesting subject;\r\nbut it is assuredly one which well deserves the attention of commercial\r\nmen in England.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable source of Peruvian wealth, and one which has\r\ncaused effects on her financial system which are perhaps unique in the\r\nhistory of any country, is the guano on the desert islands off the\r\ncoast. When the South American Republics were thrown open to the trade\r\nof Europe, the value of guano as a manure was soon discovered, the\r\ndemand rapidly increased, and the Peruvian Government were not long in\r\navailing themselves of this, as they believed, inexhaustible source of\r\nriches.[360] The three Chincha islands, in the bay of Pisco, contained\r\na total of 12,376,100 tons of guano in 1853, and, as since that time\r\n2,837,365 tons have been exported up to 1860, there were 9,538,735 tons\r\nremaining in 1861.[361] In 1860 as many as 433 vessels, with a tonnage\r\nof 348,554, loaded at the Chincha islands; so that, at the above rate,\r\nthe guano will last for twenty-three years, until 1883. The guano\r\nmonopoly brings in a revenue to the State of 14,850,000 dollars.\r\n\r\nIn Peru even the arid deserts are the sources of enormous wealth; for\r\nwhile the desolate Chinchas pour millions into the treasury, the pampa\r\nof Tamarugal, in the Tarapaca province, contributes its nitrate of soda\r\n(_salitre_) and borate of lime to swell the riches of this favoured\r\nland. It is calculated that the nitrate of soda grounds in this\r\ndistrict cover fifty square leagues, and, allowing one hundred pounds\r\nweight of nitrate for each square yard, this will give 63,000,000\r\ntons, which, at the present rate of consumption, will last for 1393\r\nyears.[362] In 1860 the export of nitrate of soda from the port of\r\nIquique amounted to 1,370,248 cwts., and a good deal of borax is also\r\nexported, though its shipment is prohibited by the Government.\r\n\r\nThe extensive use of mineral substances, such as guano and nitrate of\r\nsoda, as a top-dressing for corn-crops, is a discovery of modern times,\r\nand these manures were not generally appreciated in England until a\r\nperiod between 1824 and 1829. I believe that farmers consider guano and\r\nnitrate of soda to be about equally efficacious as a top-dressing for\r\ncorn; and it is now a matter of pressing interest to the agricultural\r\ncommunity in England to reduce their prices, which are as high as\r\ntwelve and sixteen pounds a ton respectively. But, with this view,\r\na careful search for deposits of guano in other parts of the world\r\nhas only led to the discovery of those at Ichaboe, on the coast of\r\nAfrica, in 1843, and of those on the Arabian Kooria Mooria islands\r\nmore recently. The deposit at Ichaboe was all carried off by the end\r\nof 1845, while that on Jibleea, one of the Kooria Moorias, is still\r\nbeing worked; but it is very inferior to the guano of the Peruvian\r\nislands.[363]\r\n\r\nOn the whole these attempts to find other deposits of guano, which\r\nwould tend to bring down the price in England, have failed of success;\r\nand the Peruvians may consider themselves secure of their strange\r\nsource of revenue for some twenty years to come. And a stranger means\r\nof defraying nearly the whole expenditure of the state was never before\r\nheard of. In 1859 the disbursements amounted to 20,387,756 dollars, of\r\nwhich sum three-fourths were raised by shovelling heaps of dirt off a\r\ndesolate island on the coast!\r\n\r\nA prudent Government would have looked upon the guano monopoly as\r\nan extraordinary item in the receipts, and would have reserved it\r\nfor paying off the internal and foreign debt, for public works, and\r\nimprovements; but the heads of the Peruvians appear to have been\r\nturned by this wonderful increase of their revenue, and they have\r\nsquandered it with ruinous and dishonest recklessness. It is true that\r\nthe interest of the foreign debt has been paid,[364] but otherwise the\r\nlarge receipts have either been embezzled, as in General Echenique's\r\ntime, or spent on immense and unnecessary armaments, and in jobbing\r\nsalaries and pensions. Thousands of families now live on the public\r\nmoney, and, when the guano receipts fail, the ruin and suffering will\r\nbe severe and widely spread. On the strength of the guano monopoly\r\nalmost all the taxes have been abolished, the tribute of the Indians\r\namongst them, and the revenue is composed mainly of three items--guano,\r\ncustoms, and stamps. A biennial budget, containing the receipts and\r\ndisbursements, is laid before Congress every session. I have these\r\nbudgets before me for several years back; but that for 1859 will\r\nsuffice to show the extraordinary nature of the revenue, and the still\r\nmore extraordinary way in which it is spent:--\r\n\r\n         _Receipts._          |         _Disbursements._\r\n                              |\r\n                     Dollars. |                                 Dollars.\r\n  Guano             15,875,352|Pay, &c., to members of Congress  211,084\r\n  Customs, &c.       5,079,439|Army and navy, with pensions    9,746,432\r\n  Surplus from 1858    938,389|Civil expenses, with pensions   2,129,904\r\n                              |Payments to ecclesiastics          63,296\r\n                              |Public works                      718,124\r\n                              |Education and charitable\r\n                              |institutions                      332,471\r\n                              |Police                             92,807\r\n                              |Compensation for slaves\r\n                              |and internal debt               1,576,004\r\n                              |Redemption of Bonds             3,218,700\r\n                              |Miscellaneous                     107,146\r\n                              |Interest of all kinds           2,191,777\r\n                              |                               20,387,745\r\n                    --------- |     Surplus                    1,505,435\r\n                   21,893,180 |                               21,893,180\r\n                   ---------- |\r\n\r\nThe foreign debt is 24,205,400 dollars, and the internal debt and\r\ncompensation for slaves amount to a still larger sum. But the great\r\ndrag upon the public treasury is the enormous army of 15,000 men for a\r\npopulation under two million, with upwards of 2000 officers, those who\r\nare unattached being still retained on full pay. This will give some\r\nidea of the number of families who are living in luxury and idleness\r\non the public money, and of the distress that will follow the sudden\r\nstoppage of their incomes, which is inevitable when the guano comes\r\nto an end. It will be an embarrassing and difficult question for some\r\nfuture Government to decide upon the proper measures for the disposal\r\nof an unwieldy army and a crowd of hungry beggared officers. The best\r\nsuggestion on this subject has come from the late General Miller,\r\nwho, when governing Cuzco in 1836, proposed to establish military\r\ncolonies in the forests to the eastward of the Andes, and thus convert\r\na mischievous and dangerous tool for treason and faction into a means\r\nof enriching the country.\r\n\r\nThe administration of justice in Peru, though the laws are excellent,\r\nand have been codified and ably edited, is so corrupt that it is better\r\nto pass over the subject with a hope that things may be better in a\r\nfuture generation; and the police administration, especially round\r\nLima, is disgraceful.\r\n\r\nMuch indeed will be required, and much I trust is to be hoped, from the\r\nrising generation of young men who are now about to enter upon public\r\nlife. Many of them have been educated in Europe, a large proportion\r\nare well-informed, polished by travel and extensive reading, and\r\nardently desirous of distinguishing themselves in the service of the\r\nState. In literature they have already displayed considerable industry\r\nand ability. The 'Revista de Lima,' a bi-monthly periodical, contains\r\narchæological, biographical, historical, and financial articles and\r\nreviews, generally very ably written, in an enlightened and liberal\r\nspirit, and by men who evidently take an earnest view of life. The\r\ncontributors, among whom are the Señores Lavalle, Ulloa, Pardo, Flores,\r\nMasias, and the painter Laso, are all young men with a career before\r\nthem. It is a good sign, too, that effective steps have been taken\r\nto edit and reprint historical materials which have long remained in\r\nmanuscript, or in scarce old editions. Thus Don Manuel A. Fuentes has\r\nrecently brought out six most interesting volumes containing reports of\r\nthe administrations of several of the Spanish viceroys of Peru,[365]\r\nand a new edition of the 'Mercurio Peruano.' His 'Estadistica de Lima'\r\nis also a work which displays considerable merit: and Don Sebastian\r\nLorente's well-known learning, and habit of careful research, promise\r\nthat his history of Peru, now on the point of being published in Paris,\r\nwill be a work of great value.\r\n\r\nThis hasty glance at the present state of Peru, as regards its\r\ngovernment, material resources, and literature, will, I trust, have\r\nshown that the people of these South American states are not altogether\r\nthe hopelessly degraded race that they are often represented; and that\r\nthere are grounds for believing that there is yet a happier future in\r\nstore for them. For, be it remembered, that Peru is far from being the\r\nbest specimen of these republics, and that the Chilians have displayed\r\ntenfold the ability, both in governing, in commercial and agricultural\r\npursuits, and in literature. I think there can be no doubt that a\r\nhasty conclusion respecting the South American races, founded on their\r\nhistory since the independence, is likely to be erroneous and unfair;\r\nand that, under more favourable circumstances, they are in every way\r\ncapable of better things.\r\n\r\nI cannot better conclude this chapter than by quoting the words of that\r\nnoble old warrior General Miller, written only a few months before\r\nhis death, in November 1861. This most excellent of men fought all\r\nthe battles of independence from 1817 to 1824; he was covered with\r\nwounds and riddled with bullets[366] while striving for South American\r\nfreedom; he had watched with sorrowful attention the subsequent anarchy\r\nand civil wars, and his words carry great weight with them. It will\r\nbe seen that he does not despond, but looks forward with hope to the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nHe says, \"South America, with good reason, must feel for ever proud\r\nof Camilo Henriquez, Vigil, and Mariategui, Olmedo and Felipe Pardo,\r\nSan Martin and O'Higgins, and many others of her illustrious sons. And\r\nwhat may not be expected from the rising and future generations, now\r\nthat there are such universities as that of Santiago de Chile, and\r\nsuch men as Bello to direct and foster them! Who can be blind to the\r\ngenius and great natural abilities of the Peruvian youth, now shooting\r\nforth, notwithstanding the great disadvantages under which Peru at\r\npresent labours, with regard to the state of her colleges? With her\r\nimmense resources, a good government, and tranquillity, what may not be\r\nexpected! But every nation has its beginning, an inevitable and perhaps\r\nnecessarily rough ordeal to undergo, and South America must not expect\r\nto make a leap that no other country has been able to do.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map to illustrate M^R. SPRUCE'S REPORTS on the \"RED\r\nBARK\" REGION OF ECUADOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Spruce's expedition to procure plants and seeds of the \"red bark\"\r\n  or _C. succirubra_--Mr. Pritchett in the Huanuco region, and the \"grey\r\n  barks\"--Mr. Cross's proceedings at Loxa, and collection of seeds of\r\n  _C. Condaminea_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN a previous chapter I have given an account of the arrangements\r\nwhich I made for procuring the various species of Chinchonæ in\r\ndistricts other than that of the Calisaya, and it now remains for me to\r\nrecord the labours of those whom I employed on this service, and the\r\nsuccessful results with which those labours were rewarded. And first,\r\nboth in importance and success, stands the expedition of Mr. Spruce, to\r\ncollect the seeds and plants of the \"red-bark\" tree or _C. succirubra_,\r\nof whose services it would be impossible to speak too highly. I may\r\nmention, at starting, that he received my first letter, requesting him\r\nto undertake the work, on July 2nd, 1859, and such was his zeal that on\r\nthe 22nd of the same month he was on his way to the chinchona forests,\r\nat his own expense, to ascertain the best locality for collecting the\r\nplants and seeds.\r\n\r\nThe species of chinchona, known as the \"red-bark\" tree, yields a larger\r\nper-centage of febrifugal alkaloid than any other, and must therefore\r\nbe considered as the most important.[367] Its native forests are on the\r\nwestern slopes of the famous mountain of Chimborazo, in the Republic\r\nof Ecuador, and for a great many years it has not been found beyond 2°\r\n36´ S. lat., but Mr. Spruce thinks it probable that in former times the\r\ntree grew all along the roots of the Andes of Cuenca and Loxa to the\r\nlimits of the Peruvian desert in 5° S. To the north it scarcely passes\r\nthe latitude of 1° S.; and these precious trees are thus confined\r\nwithin a very narrow latitudinal zone.[368] Within the ascertained\r\nlimits of the true \"red-bark\" tree, it exists in all the valleys of\r\nthe Andes which debouch on the plain of Guayaquil; but great havoc\r\nhas been made amongst the trees of late years by the bark-collectors.\r\nIn the valleys of Alausi, Pallatanga, and Chillanes (see map) all the\r\nlarge trees have already been cut down. At the bases of the ridges of\r\nAngas and San Antonio, the localities originally mentioned by Pavon,\r\nand where \"red-bark\" trees once grew in abundance, the same destructive\r\nsystem has been adopted; and now the \"red-bark\" grounds are confined to\r\nthe ravine of the river Chasuan, and its tributaries, which rise on the\r\nnorthern slopes of Chimborazo, and fall into the river of Guayaquil.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of July 1859 Mr. Spruce set out from the pleasant town\r\nof Ambato, in the Quitenian Andes, where he was then residing, and,\r\npassing through Alausi, arrived at the banks of the river Chanchan, and\r\nestablished himself at a place called Lucmas, which is conveniently\r\nnear the \"red-bark\" chinchona forests. Lucmas is a sugar-cane farm,\r\nbetween 5000 and 6000 feet above the sea; there are forest-trees in\r\nthe valleys and on the hills, while the steep slopes are often covered\r\nwith scrub and grass. From Lucmas Mr. Spruce went to the forests on\r\nthe banks of the river Pumachaca, which rises in the mountain of\r\nAsuay, and falls into the Chanchan, at an elevation of 4000 feet. One\r\ncircumstance, among many, will give an idea of the difficulties which\r\nhe had to encounter. On reaching the Pumachaca he found that the ford\r\nhad been destroyed by the falling of a cliff, and that in its place\r\nthere was a deep whirlpool; so, with the driftwood along the banks, a\r\nbridge had to be made where the river was narrowed between two rocks,\r\nby which his party crossed with the baggage. Then, after a long search,\r\nhe found a place where the horses could swim across, and, by rolling\r\ndown masses of earth and stones, a way was made for them to ascend\r\non the other side. Once across, a hut was made among vegetable-ivory\r\npalms, thatched with the palm-fronds, and Mr. Spruce commenced the\r\nexamination of the forest.\r\n\r\nAfter a long search, during which he passed several felled trunks of\r\nchinchona-trees, he at length came upon a root-shoot about twenty feet\r\nhigh. It is very rare to find these root-shoots, because the bark is\r\nstripped from the roots as well as from the trunk. Mr. Spruce, from\r\nhis observations in the Pumachaca forest, came to the conclusion that\r\nthe \"red-bark\" trees grow best on stony declivities, where there is,\r\nhowever, a good depth of humus, at an elevation of from 3000 to 5000\r\nfeet above the sea. The temperature was very like that of a summer\r\nday in London, but with cold mists towards evening, and from January\r\nto May unceasing rain. He found the chinchona-trees, in this part of\r\nthe country, almost entirely extirpated, and, after a short stay at\r\nLucmas, he proceeded to examine the region of the \"hill barks\" or\r\n_cascarillas serranas_, which is at an elevation of 8500 to 9000 feet,\r\non both sides of the river Chanchan. In the forest of Llalla, at the\r\nfoot of the mountain of Asuay, he found two kinds called by the natives\r\n_cuchi-cara_ (pig-skin) and _pata de gallinazo_;[369] and on a stony\r\nhill-side there were twenty large trees of the former, from 40 to 50\r\nfeet high.\r\n\r\nBy this excursion in the summer of 1859 Mr. Spruce ascertained the\r\ndistricts where he should not go to, a very important point; and he\r\nfinally determined to carry on his collecting operations, in the season\r\nof 1860, at a place called Limon, at the junction of a stream of that\r\nname with the river Chasuan, which falls into the river of Ventanas\r\nat a place called Aguacatal. (See map.) The forests are all private\r\nproperty, and, after much negotiation with the owners, Señor Cordovez\r\nof Ambato, and Dr. Neyra of Guaranda, an agreement was made by which,\r\non payment of 400 dollars, Mr. Spruce was allowed to take as many seeds\r\nand plants as he liked, on condition that he did not touch the bark.\r\n\r\nMr. Spruce had made arrangements for Dr. Taylor of Riobamba to proceed\r\nto Loxa, and collect seeds of the _C. Condaminea_ species; but a severe\r\nrheumatic and nervous attack, almost amounting to paralysis, induced\r\nhim to resign the duty of collecting the \"red bark\" to Dr. Taylor, and\r\nit was only at the last moment that he was strong enough to undertake\r\nthe journey in company with his friend. During the whole time that\r\nMr. Spruce was at work he was suffering severely from illness; the\r\nbenefit derived from the milder climate of the forests was neutralized\r\nby the fogs and damp; and, to use his own words, \"although upheld by\r\na determination to execute to the best of my ability the task I had\r\nundertaken, I was but too often in that state of prostration when to\r\nlie down quietly and die would have seemed a relief.\" Leaving the\r\ntown of Ambato on the 11th of June, Mr. Spruce and Dr. Taylor reached\r\nGuaranda on the 13th, and continued their journey towards the forests\r\non the 17th. At a very little below 4000 feet above the sea they\r\nreached the small farms at Limon. Their abode stood on a narrow ridge\r\nsloping gradually to the river Chasuan. It was merely a long low shed,\r\ntwo-thirds of which was occupied by the rude machinery of a sugar-cane\r\nmill; the remaining third had an upper story with a flooring of\r\nbamboo-planks, half of it open at the sides, and the other half with a\r\nbamboo wall about six feet high, not coming up to the roof in any part\r\nof it. This was their dormitory, and it was reached by a ladder, merely\r\na trunk of a tree with rude notches for steps. On the ground-floor was\r\nthe kitchen, with a wall of rough planks of raft wood, not touching\r\neach other; so that the whole fabric was abundantly ventilated, and\r\nonly too often filled with fog, causing coughs, aching limbs, and\r\nmouldy clothes.\r\n\r\nThis was their head-quarters during the time that they were collecting\r\nseeds and plants; and the severe hardships, miserable lodging, and\r\nacute sufferings from illness must increase our admiration for Mr.\r\nSpruce's zeal and resolution in performing this great public service.\r\n\r\nMr. Cross, the gardener whom I had engaged to assist Mr. Spruce,\r\nconveyed the fifteen Wardian cases, which I had previously sent to\r\nGuayaquil, up the river as far as Ventanas, and reached Limon on the\r\n27th of July.\r\n\r\nIn the mean while Mr. Spruce had carefully examined the chinchona\r\nforests, and visited all the bark-trees known to exist within reach\r\nof Limon. He found a good crop of capsules on many of them, which had\r\nalready nearly reached their full size on the finest trees; on others,\r\nhowever, there were only very young capsules, and even a good many\r\nflowers, and not one of the late-flowering panicles produced ripe\r\ncapsules. On the tree which bore most capsules they began to turn\r\nmouldy, the mould being not fungi, but rudimentary lichens, which,\r\nwhilst it proved that the capsules were still alive and growing,\r\nproved also that they were exposed to an atmosphere almost constantly\r\nsaturated with moisture.\r\n\r\nThe _manchon_ or clump of \"red-bark\" trees at Limon lies nearly west\r\nfrom the peak of Chimborazo, and the river Chasuan rises on the\r\nnorthern shoulder of that mountain. The view from Limon takes in a vast\r\nextent of country, and the whole is unbroken forest, save towards the\r\nsource of the Chasuan, where a lofty ridge rises above the region of\r\narborescent vegetation, and is crowned by a small breadth of grassy\r\n_paramo_. The waters of the Chasuan run over a black or dull blue,\r\nshining, and very compact trachyte, over which, in the bottom of the\r\nvalleys at Limon, there is a fine-grained ferruginous sandstone of a\r\ndeep brown colour, in thick strata. The soil is a deep loamy alluvial\r\ndeposit. The ridges on which the \"red-bark\" trees grow all deviate\r\na little from an easterly and westerly direction, and the chinchonæ\r\nare far more abundant on the northern than on the southern slopes.\r\nThe northern and eastern sides of the trees, too, had borne most\r\nfruit, and scarcely a capsule ripened on their southern and western\r\nsides. This is explained by the trees receiving most sun from the\r\neast and north, the mornings being generally clear and sunny in the\r\nsummer, whilst the afternoons are foggy, and the sun's declination is\r\nnortherly. Mr. Spruce also observed that the trees standing in open\r\nground were far healthier and more luxuriant than those growing in the\r\nforest, where they are hemmed in and partially shaded by other trees;\r\nand he concludes, from this circumstance, that, though the \"red-bark\"\r\ntree may need shade whilst young and tender, it really requires (like\r\nmost trees) plenty of air, light, and room wherein to develop its\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\nThe lowest site of the \"red-bark\" tree at Limon is at an elevation of\r\n2450 feet above the sea, and its highest limit is at an elevation of\r\nabout 5000 feet. The trees nearest the plain are generally the largest,\r\nbut those higher up have much thicker bark in proportion to their\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\nThe havoc committed by the bark-collectors on these trees within the\r\nlast twenty years has been very great. The entire quantity of \"red\r\nbark\" collected in 1859 did not reach to 5000 lbs., and in 1860 no\r\n\"red bark\" at all was got out, so that the trade is nearly extinct. In\r\nthe valleys of the Chasuan and Limon Mr. Spruce saw about 200 of these\r\ntrees standing, but only two or three were saplings which had not\r\nbeen disturbed; all the rest grew from old stools, whose circumference\r\naveraged from 4 to 5 feet. He was unable to find a single young plant\r\nunder the trees, although many of the latter bore signs of having\r\nflowered in previous years; and this was explained by the flowering\r\ntrees invariably growing in open places, where the ground was either\r\nweeded, or trodden down by cattle.\r\n\r\nMr. Spruce describes the _C. succirubra_ or \"red-bark\" tree as very\r\nhandsome, and he declares that, in looking out over the forest, he\r\ncould never find any other tree at all comparable to it for beauty.\r\nIt is fifty feet high, branching from about one-third of its height,\r\nwith large, broadly ovate, deep green, and shining leaves, mixed with\r\ndecaying ones of a blood-red colour, which give it a most striking\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nThe _Cascarilla magnifolia_, a very handsome tree, with a fragrant\r\nwhite flower, grows abundantly with the \"red bark,\" and attains a\r\nheight of 80 feet.\r\n\r\nAfter the arrival of Mr. Cross at Limon the work of collecting\r\ncommenced in earnest. A piece of ground was fenced in, and Mr. Cross\r\nmade a pit and prepared the soil to receive cuttings, of which he put\r\nin above a thousand on the 1st of August and following days; and he\r\nafterwards went round to all the old stools and put in as many layers\r\nfrom them as possible. \"But,\" as Mr. Spruce most truly observes, \"only\r\nthose who have attempted to do anything in the forest, possessing\r\nscarcely any of the necessary appliances, can have any idea of the\r\ndifficulties, and Mr. Cross's unremitting watchfulness alone enabled\r\nhim to surmount them.\"\r\n\r\nTowards the end of July, in a few sunny days, the fruit of the\r\n\"red-bark\" trees made visible advances towards maturity; and in the\r\nmiddle of August the capsules began to burst at the base, and appeared\r\nripe. An Indian was then sent up the trees, and, breaking the panicles\r\ngently off, let them fall on sheets spread on the ground to receive\r\nthem, so that the few loose seeds shaken out by the fall were not\r\nlost. The capsules were afterwards spread out to dry for some days on\r\nthe same sheets. In September Mr. Spruce went across to the valley\r\nof the San Antonio, to the southward, in order to secure additional\r\nseeds from \"red-bark\" trees there, leaving Mr. Cross to watch over the\r\nrooting of the cuttings at Limon. Between the 14th and 19th he gathered\r\n500 well-grown capsules at San Antonio, in addition to 2000 already\r\ncollected at Limon. Good capsules contain forty seeds each, so that\r\nat least 100,000 well-ripened and well-dried seeds were now gathered;\r\nand on the 28th of September Mr. Spruce started for Guayaquil.[370]\r\nIn November he proceeded up the river again, and purchased one of the\r\nrafts at Ventanas, which are used for conveying cacao to Guayaquil. It\r\nwas composed of twelve trunks of raft-wood, sixty-three to sixty-six\r\nfeet long and one foot in diameter, kept in their places by shorter\r\npieces tied transversely, and covered with bamboo planking, fenced\r\nround with rails to a height of three feet, and roofed over. The rope\r\nused for binding the parts of the raft together was the twining stem\r\nof a _Bignonia_. The Wardian cases were got ready on the raft at\r\nVentanas, and Mr. Cross arrived with the plants from Limon on the 13th\r\nof December, and established them in the cases to the number of 637.\r\n\r\nAfter encountering several dangers and mishaps in navigating the river,\r\nthe raft with its precious freight reached Guayaquil on the 27th of\r\nDecember; and the plants were safely embarked on board the steamer, in\r\ncharge of Mr. Cross, on the 2nd of January, 1861.\r\n\r\nThus skilfully and successfully did Mr. Spruce, and his able\r\ncolleagues, perform this most difficult and important service. Mr.\r\nSpruce, during the whole time that he was in the chinchona forests,\r\nmade most careful meteorological observations. From June 19th to\r\nDecember 8th the results of observations of the thermometer were as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  Mean minimum                       61-1/2°\r\n  Mean maximum                       72-1/3\r\n  Mean temperature at 6-1/2 P.M.     67-3/4\r\n  Highest temperature observed       80-1/2 on July 27th.\r\n  Lowest       \"         \"           57     on July 11th.\r\n  Entire range                       23-1/2\r\n  Mean daily variation               10-1/2\r\n\r\nOn the western side of the Quitenian Andes, south of the Equator, the\r\nsummer or dry season lasts from June to December, the remaining five\r\nmonths constituting the wet season. In the summer, at Limon, the early\r\npart of the day is often sunny, and fogs come on in the afternoon and\r\nnight; but in the wet season there are fogs in the morning, and heavy\r\nrains during the rest of the day and night.\r\n\r\nA perusal of the foregoing pages, which are nothing more than a brief\r\nabstract from Mr. Spruce's official reports, cannot fail to impress\r\nthe reader with the valuable nature of the service which has been\r\nperformed, and with the energy and fortitude, combined with great skill\r\nand ability, which enabled Mr. Spruce to overcome so many difficulties;\r\nand almost equal praise is due to Mr. Cross. But in recounting these\r\narduous labours, only half of Mr. Spruce's services have been recorded.\r\nThat gentleman is an accomplished botanist, and most accurate observer;\r\nand he has supplied us with a detailed report which, I do not hesitate\r\nto say, contains a larger amount of valuable information on the\r\nchinchona-forests than any account which has yet appeared in Europe.\r\nIn addition to the narrative of his proceedings, and his observations\r\non the \"red-bark\" tree, Mr. Spruce here gives a minute account of\r\nthe vegetation of the \"red-bark\" forests of Chimborazo, a detailed\r\nmeteorological journal, and important remarks on the climate and\r\nsoil.[371]\r\n\r\nMy apprehensions respecting the feelings of the natives, when our\r\nproceedings became known, were fully justified by what took place in\r\nEcuador, as well as in Peru. But the South Americans are, as a rule,\r\nremarkable for the slowness of their movements; and it was not until\r\nMay 1st, 1861, that the legislature of Ecuador decreed that every\r\nperson, whether foreigner or native, should be forbidden to make\r\ncollections of plants, cuttings, or seeds of the quina-tree; and that\r\nprecautions should be taken to prevent those articles from passing the\r\nports and frontiers of the Republic. A fine of 100 dollars on every\r\nplant, and every drachm of seed, was imposed on those who attempted to\r\nbreak this decree. But by May 1st, 1861, the plants and seeds of the\r\nquina-tree were safe on the Neilgherry hills, in Southern India.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Spruce was engaged in collecting these seeds and plants in\r\nthe forests at the foot of Chimborazo, Mr. Pritchett, whose services I\r\nhad secured for the Huanuco region in Northern Peru, was employed on\r\nthe species of chinchonæ yielding grey bark.\r\n\r\nMr. Pritchett left Lima on the 18th of May, 1860, and arrived in the\r\ntown of Huanuco, the centre of the grey-bark region, on the 28th, where\r\nhe made the necessary preparations for a journey into the neighbouring\r\nforests. On the 9th of June he set out for the mountain-range of\r\nCarpis, to the northward, where there are several species of chinchonæ.\r\nThe _C. purpurea_ is very abundant; the _C. nitida_ is common on\r\nthe north-east side, and on the upper part of the mountains; the _C.\r\nobovata_ is more rare; and the _C. micrantha_ and _C. Peruviana_ are\r\nboth inhabitants of the lower slopes. After crossing the Carpis range,\r\nMr. Pritchett followed the course of the river of Casapi to the village\r\nof Chinchao, and went thence to the coca estate of Casapi, at the\r\neastern end of the valley, where it joins that of the river Huallaga,\r\nand here he was joined by his guide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHINCHONA NITIDA TREES.\r\n\r\nFROM A SKETCH BY MR. PRITCHETT.  Page 323]\r\n\r\nAbout three leagues from Casapi, and close to the Huallaga, is the\r\nmountain called San Cristoval de Cocheros (Cuchero of Pavon and\r\nPoeppig), which rises from the low land at the junction of the two\r\nrivers to a height of about 1200 feet above them, and is the centre of\r\nthe bark district of Huanuco. On the northern side Mr. Pritchett found\r\nabundance of _C. micrantha_, and some trees of _C. Peruviana_; but\r\nthe latter species was much more rare. They both grow to a very large\r\nsize, some of them being thirty inches in diameter and seventy feet in\r\nheight. The trees of _C. nitida_ were at a higher elevation.\r\n\r\nDuring June and July, though it was the dry season, heavy rains\r\ncontinued to fall from day to day; but towards the end of July the\r\nweather broke up, and the sun began to make an impression on the solid\r\nbanks of cloud which filled the valleys, and then it was that, during\r\nsome portion of the day, the sun penetrated to the very underwood of\r\nthe forest. In the first half of August there was fine weather, with\r\nonly an occasional shower. The seeds on the chinchona-trees ripened\r\nrapidly in the sunshine, and Mr. Pritchett collected them by felling\r\nthe trees--a labour which was performed by Indians, whom he hired from\r\nthe coca estate of Casapi. Seven large trees were cut down daily, and\r\ndenuded of their capsules, for a fortnight; the drying process being\r\ncarried on at the estate, where every moment of sunshine was taken\r\nadvantage of. On the 13th of August he started for the coast with his\r\ncollection of seeds, and half a mule-load of young chinchona-plants,\r\nwhich were in perfect health when placed in the Wardian cases at Lima.\r\n\r\nMr. Pritchett reports that in the district around Cocheros, Casapi,\r\nand Carpis, the rocks are of crystalline formation, in many localities\r\nhighly disintegrated, and composed of masses of hornblende, felspar,\r\nand mica. He remarks that felspar contains much potash, of which the\r\nchinchona-trees are said to require a large quantity for their full\r\ndevelopment; and, as felspar abounds in this region, he attributes the\r\nabundance and size of the chinchona-trees to this circumstance. He also\r\nreports that steatite, a silicate of magnesia and alumina, abounds in\r\nthe vicinity of Huanuco.\r\n\r\nHe describes the climate as moist and warm, and says that the\r\ndifference in the degree of moisture and warmth between the lower\r\nslopes where the _C. micrantha_ flourishes, and the higher parts of\r\nthe mountains inhabited by the _C. nitida_, is very striking, while on\r\nthe lower slopes the soil is much deeper and richer.[372] He reports\r\nthe elevation of Cocheros above the level of the sea to be about 4000\r\nfeet,[373] but he made no meteorological or other observations; and\r\nI think there can be no doubt that the elevation of that mountain\r\nis much greater than Mr. Pritchett supposes. I do not find any\r\ninformation on this point in Poeppig's travels; but the Huanuco region\r\nis quite a beaten track, and there are several accounts of it by\r\nmodern travellers. Huanuco itself is 6300 feet above the sea;[374]\r\nthe distance thence to the summit of the cuesta del Carpis, which is\r\n8000 feet above the sea, is about twenty miles, and there is a descent\r\non the other side into the valley of the Casapi of 2920 feet.[375]\r\nAccording to this account the village of Chinchao, in the Casapi\r\nvalley, would have an elevation of about 5000 feet. From Chinchao to\r\nthe foot of the Cocheros mountain is a distance of twenty-five miles\r\ndown the Casapi valley,[376] a gentle descent, with numerous cottages\r\nand plantations on both sides of the road.[377] Thus the foot of the\r\nCocheros mountain would be about 4500 feet above the sea, and its\r\nsummit at least 6000 feet.\r\n\r\nWe shall not, therefore, be very far from the truth if we place the\r\nregion of _C. nitida_ on the Cocheros and Carpis mountains at from 6000\r\nto 7000 feet above the sea, and of _C. micrantha_ at from 4000 to 5000\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nMr. Pritchett performed the portion of this important undertaking which\r\nI intrusted to him with promptitude and zeal. Time was a great object,\r\nand, by going direct from Lima to the best locality in the Huanuco\r\nchinchona region, he completed the necessary collection of plants and\r\nseeds, and returned to the coast in little more than three months.[378]\r\nThis shows how essential a previous knowledge of the chinchona region,\r\nof the people, and of the language, was, without which the collector\r\nwould probably lose much time, which is the same thing as spending\r\nmuch money, and eventually wander into a locality where only worthless\r\nspecies are found, as was the case with the Dutch agent.\r\n\r\nOwing to the unavoidable abandonment of Mr. Spruce's intention of\r\nsending Dr. Taylor to collect seeds of _C. Condaminea_ at Loxa, one\r\nportion of my scheme for introducing all the valuable species into\r\nIndia remained incomplete at the close of 1860. On my return from\r\nIndia, therefore, in May 1861, I obtained the sanction of the Secretary\r\nof State for India to take measures for obtaining a supply of seeds\r\nfrom the Loxa forests. Mr. Cross, the gardener who had so ably assisted\r\nMr. Spruce, and shared his labours, after safely depositing the\r\ncollection of seeds and plants in India, had returned to South America,\r\nattracted by the richness and variety of the flora of the Andes. Having\r\nacquired experience of the people and language, of the localities\r\nwhere chinchona-trees are found, and of the mode of travelling, during\r\nhis former visit, he possessed the necessary qualifications; and, as\r\nMr. Spruce was too ill to undertake the work, it was intrusted to Mr.\r\nCross, who performed it with expedition and success. He is an excellent\r\npractical gardener, intelligent and persevering, ardently devoted to\r\nhis profession, and thoroughly trustworthy.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of September, 1861, Mr. Cross left Guayaquil in an open\r\nrowing boat, and landed at Santa Rosa, the port of the province of\r\nLoxa, whence he proceeded, by way of Zaruma, to the town of Loxa, which\r\nhe reached on the 27th. He had to pass through dense swampy forests,\r\nover dangerous precipitous ridges of the Andes, in crossing one of\r\nwhich his mule slipped down a deep ravine and was dashed to pieces, and\r\nalong barren lofty plains. He mentions that during the ascent to Zaruma\r\nhe saw several \"red-bark\" trees growing at an elevation of eight or\r\nnine thousand feet.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of October he left Loxa, and went to a long low ridge\r\nof hills, called the Sierra de Cajanuma, about eight miles to the\r\nsouthward, a locality which is mentioned by Humboldt, Bonpland, and\r\nCaldas, as the abode of the most valuable kinds of _C. Condaminea_. He\r\ncame to an Indian hut on a little rounded eminence near the summit of\r\nthe mountain, which, being far from public roads or other dwellings,\r\nseemed well suited for his head-quarters during the time that he was\r\nsearching for seeds. For be it remembered that the Decree of May 1st,\r\n1861, already mentioned, was in full force, and that he was running the\r\nrisk of fine and imprisonment in performing this important service. The\r\nowner of the hut, who was an experienced bark-collector, allowed Mr.\r\nCross to establish himself in a little shed at one end of it, which,\r\nalthough favourable for drying seeds, was so cold that he was sometimes\r\ncompelled, during windy nights, to seek shelter in the bottom of a\r\nneighbouring ravine.\r\n\r\nAfter many comparatively unsuccessful searches in the surrounding\r\nwoods, he was one day passing along the bank of a steep ravine, and,\r\nhappening to look over a projecting rock, he saw a number of fine young\r\ntrees of the _C. Condaminea_ on the steep slope beneath, some of which\r\nbore a few panicles of seeds, which, on examination, he found to be\r\nperfectly ripe. After this discovery he continued to search all the\r\nravines in the vicinity from sunrise to sunset, some of which he had to\r\ndescend by means of the trailing stems of a species of _Passiflora_,\r\nand in this way a good supply of seeds was collected. He reports that\r\non the accessible slopes there are few chinchona-trees, owing partly\r\nto the annual burning, and partly to continual cropping of the young\r\nshoots by cattle. He describes the rocks, composed of micaceous schist\r\nand gneiss, as being, in many places, in a state of decomposition,\r\nand states that large portions are frequently tumbling down from the\r\nmore elevated summits. The alluvial deposit in the ravines, where\r\nthe _C. Condaminea_ is found growing, is shallow, in many places not\r\nmore than six inches in depth, and Mr. Cross often gathered seeds\r\nfrom trees which were growing in clefts of rock, where there was not\r\na single ounce of soil to be found. He describes the _C. Condaminea_\r\nas a slender tree, from 20 to 30 feet in height,[379] and from 8 to\r\n10 inches in diameter at the base; but he saw few trees of these\r\ndimensions, and the plants from which the bark of commerce is now taken\r\nare in general not more than 8 to 10 feet in height.[380] When the\r\nplants are cut down, three or four young shoots or suckers generally\r\nspring up, but this does not always happen, as some of the more\r\nindustrious bark-collectors frequently pull up the roots, and bark them\r\nalso. The bark is taken from the smallest twigs, and thus the annual\r\ngrowths are often taken, especially if they are strong. The plants are\r\nsometimes found growing in small clumps, and sometimes solitary, but\r\nalways in dry situations.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of this region ranges according to Humboldt and Caldas\r\nfrom 41° to 72° Fahr., and according to Mr. Cross from 34° to 70°\r\nFahr.; but he adds that it seldom falls below 40°, and rarely rises\r\nabove 65°; the mean range being from 45° to 60° Fahr. The climate of\r\nLoxa is very moist. The wet season commences in January and lasts until\r\nthe end of April or middle of May; in June, July, and August there are\r\nheavy rains, accompanied by strong gales of wind; from September to\r\nJanuary there is generally fine weather, but occasional showers of rain\r\nfall even at that time of year.[381]\r\n\r\nThe vegetation on the Sierra de Cajanuma is of a semi-arborescent\r\ncharacter, but some of the higher summits are bare. In the bottoms\r\nof the ravines grow a species of _Alnus_, _Melastomæ_, _Peperomias_,\r\npalms, and two species of tree ferns; and on the slopes throughout the\r\nlow-lying country, barley, maize, peas, and potatoes are cultivated.\r\nMr. Cross sent home a large collection of dried specimens of\r\nplants gathered on the Sierra de Cajanuma. Among them I observed a\r\n_Befaria_ with pretty crimson flowers, of which he says that one\r\nounce of the roots in two pints of water is taken twice a day by the\r\nIndians for dysentery; a very handsome purple lupin, growing six to\r\neight feet high; an _Embothrium_, a wide-spreading shrub, growing\r\nin dry situations; another smaller _Befaria_, a beautiful shrub,\r\ngrowing in very lofty dry localities; a _Veronica_, a shrub six to\r\neight feet high, with a blue flower; a _Gaultheria_; a wide-spreading\r\n_melastomaceous_ plant, with inconspicuous flowers; and a number of\r\n_Lycopodia_ and ferns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHINCHONA CHAHUARGUERA.\r\n\r\n(From Howard's 'Nueva Quinologia de Pavon.')   Page 329.]\r\n\r\nBesides the seeds of the _C. Condaminea_, which is identical with\r\nthe _C. Chahuarguera_ (Pavon), Mr. Cross succeeded in collecting a\r\nfew seeds of _C. crispa_ (Tafalla) after several long journeys up\r\nthe mountains. He found this kind growing at a great elevation, in a\r\ndeposit of peat, where the temperature sometimes falls to 27° Fahr.\r\nThis species of chinchona yields the _cascarilla crespilla negra_, one\r\nof the most esteemed forms of Loxa bark. Mr. Howard[382] mentions that\r\nthe _Josephiana_ bears the same relation to the normal _C. Calisaya_\r\nas the _Crespilla_ bark at Loxa does to the normal and full-grown _C.\r\nChahuarguera_.\r\n\r\nMr. Cross did his work right well, and in December, 1861, he returned\r\nto Guayaquil with nearly 100,000 seeds of _C. Chahuarguera_, and a\r\nsmaller parcel of _C. crispa_, which were forwarded to India by way of\r\nSouthampton.[383]\r\n\r\nThus were the various operations which I organized for procuring the\r\nvaluable species of chinchona-trees in South America satisfactorily\r\ncompleted; and the labours of Mr. Spruce, Dr. Taylor, Mr. Pritchett,\r\nMr. Cross, and Mr. Weir, though differing in value and importance, all\r\ndeserve the warmest recognition, for all those intrepid and courageous\r\nexplorers worked zealously and successfully, and did good service in\r\nfurthering this most important public enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nCONVEYANCE OF CHINCHONA-PLANTS AND SEEDS FROM SOUTH AMERICA TO INDIA.\r\n\r\n  Transmission of dried specimens--Voyages of plants in Wardian\r\n  cases--Arrival of plants and seeds in India--Depôt at Kew--Treatment\r\n  of plants in Wardian cases--Effects of introduction of\r\n  chinchona-plants into India on trade in South America--Neilgherry\r\n  hills.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE attempt to make simultaneous collections of seeds and plants of all\r\nthe valuable species of chinchonæ was thus crowned with almost complete\r\nsuccess. Out of my original scheme the _C. lancifolia_ of New Granada\r\nwas the only one which had not been procured. It is unnecessary to\r\nsay more respecting the numerous difficulties and dangers which were\r\nencountered by the collectors, for the narrative of the proceedings\r\ndetailed in previous chapters will have made these sufficiently\r\nobvious. So far as the labours in South America were concerned, all\r\nobstacles were surmounted, and the objects of this great enterprise\r\nwere fully attained. Not only were plants and seeds safely brought\r\nto the coast, but, in every instance, the collectors took care to\r\nprovide themselves with botanical specimens from the chinchona-trees.\r\nThus the leaves, flowers, fruit, and bark of each species, which were\r\nbrought to England, placed the identity of the valuable species to\r\nwhich the plants and seeds belonged beyond the remotest possibility\r\nof a doubt.[384] But in conveying these precious mule-loads to the\r\ncoast of Peru, and safely embarking them, only half the difficulties\r\nhad been overcome; and I could not but feel that some failures and\r\ndisappointments must be expected before the chinchona-plants were\r\nfairly established in India.\r\n\r\nThere was not much reason for apprehension with regard to the seeds;\r\nbut the plants, in the absence of any provision for conveying them\r\ndirect across the Pacific, had to undergo an ordeal of unprecedented\r\nduration. Yet the great advantage of introducing plants as well as\r\nseeds, in the immense start they would give to the young plantations in\r\nIndia, was strongly felt, and the complete success that attended the\r\nhazardous transit of at least one relay, which came under peculiarly\r\nfavourable circumstances, fully justified the attempt.\r\n\r\nI gave directions to Mr. Spruce and Mr. Pritchett to send small parcels\r\nof seeds of each species to Jamaica and Trinidad, in obedience to an\r\norder received from England, so that quinine-yielding trees might also\r\nbe introduced into our West Indian colonies; and the results of the\r\nexperiment in those islands will be given in a future chapter. The\r\ngreat bulk of the collections, however, were despatched to India, by\r\nthe roundabout way of Southampton, directly they arrived on the coast\r\nof the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe thirty Wardian cases which I sent out round Cape Horn were three\r\nfeet two inches long, ten feet ten inches broad, and three feet two\r\ninches high; and, with soil and plants, each case weighed a little\r\nover three hundredweight. The collection of plants of _C. Calisaya_,\r\n_C. ovata_, and _C. micrantha_ filled fifteen cases; and the other\r\nfifteen received the collection of _C. succirubra_ at Guayaquil. I also\r\nhad six cases of somewhat smaller dimensions constructed at Lima for\r\nthe plants from Huanuco. The fifteen cases containing the collection\r\nof chinchona-plants from Caravaya sailed from the port of Islay on the\r\n23rd of June, and reached Panama on the 6th of July, 1860, when 207 had\r\nalready begun to throw out green shoots. On their arrival in England,\r\nin August, these 207 plants were in a most flourishing and healthy\r\ncondition, and continued so until their arrival at Alexandria early in\r\nSeptember. But the intense heat of the Red Sea, where the thermometer\r\nranged from 99° in the night to 107° in the day-time, proved too much\r\nfor them, and the damage was increased by a detention of a week at\r\nBombay. Their roots were attacked by rot, yet, on their arrival in\r\nthe Neilgherry hills, their leaves still looked fresh, and several\r\nhundred green cuttings were obtained from them, which, however, failed\r\nto strike. The cases containing the chinchona-plants from Huanuco left\r\nLima in September, and were also in a most promising state when they\r\nreached England, but on their arrival in India they were all dead. The\r\n\"red-bark\" collection, under the able management of Mr. Cross, sailed\r\nfrom Guayaquil on the 2nd of January, 1861. On their arrival in England\r\nin excellent order, six of them were left at Kew as a precaution, and\r\nreplaced by six plants of _C. Calisaya_ supplied by Sir W. Hooker. At\r\nthat season the climate of the Red Sea is cool, and, owing to this\r\ncircumstance and still more to the intelligent watchfulness of a good\r\npractical gardener, 463 plants of _C. succirubra_ and six of _C.\r\nCalisaya_ were handed over to the superintendent on the Neilgherry\r\nhills, in as vigorous and healthy a condition as could possibly have\r\nbeen hoped for after such a voyage.\r\n\r\nThe \"grey-bark\" seeds arrived in the Neilgherry hills early in January,\r\n1861, and the \"red-bark\" in the following March, and both collections\r\ncame up abundantly. The supply of seeds of _C. Condaminea_ reached\r\ntheir destination in Southern India in February 1862. In order to guard\r\nagainst all accidents, a portion of the seeds of each species was left\r\nin England, and a depôt of young chinchona-plants has thus been formed\r\nat Kew Gardens, with a view to fall back upon them in the event of\r\npossible failures or misfortunes in India.[385] Seeds of each of the\r\nspecies were also sent to Ceylon, to which Sir W. Hooker added a few\r\nplants of _C. Calisaya_ from his stock at Kew.\r\n\r\nThus, in spite of one or two disappointments, the great object of the\r\nundertaking sanctioned by the Secretary of State for India was fully\r\nattained. By the spring of 1861 a large supply of plants and young\r\nseedlings was established in the Neilgherry hills; and at the present\r\nmoment we have thousands of chinchona-plants, of all the valuable\r\nspecies, flourishing and multiplying rapidly in Southern India, and in\r\nCeylon. When the unprecedented length of the voyages and the numerous\r\ntrans-shipments are taken into consideration, the wonder is that any\r\nof the plants should have been successfully conveyed from the slopes\r\nof the Andes in South America to the ghauts in Southern India, over\r\nthousands of miles, through every variety of climate, and subject to\r\nthe risk of crossing the isthmus of Panama, of changing steamers at the\r\nisland of St. Thomas, at Southampton, at Suez, and at Bombay, and of\r\nthe journey through Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe most important introduction of plants into India, by means of\r\nWardian cases, previous to the arrival of the chinchonas, was that\r\nof the tea from China in 1849 and following years by Mr. Fortune. On\r\nthose occasions the cases were strongly and coarsely made, the glass\r\nshades firmly fixed, and the glass itself thick, and glazed in pieces\r\nof moderate size. The frames were protected by a grating of iron wire,\r\nwith a canvas covering capable of being unrolled so as to screen the\r\nplants from the direct rays of the sun, if necessary. The soil was not\r\nless than eight or ten inches deep, and kept down by cross-battens, and\r\nthe plants were fairly established in it before starting. In 1849 Mr.\r\nFortune sowed large quantities of seeds in the cases, between rows of\r\nyoung plants, which germinated on their way from China to India, and\r\nreached their destination in the Himalayas in good condition. Out of\r\n250 tea-plants, 215 arrived in perfect order.[386]\r\n\r\nBut it was an easy process to convey plants by the short voyage from\r\nChina to Calcutta, when compared with the introduction of plants from\r\nthe western coast of South America into India; and the performance of\r\nthe latter feat, in the case of the chinchona-plants under Mr. Cross's\r\ncare, is undoubtedly the most extraordinary success of the kind that\r\nhas yet been achieved.\r\n\r\nA few remarks on the treatment of plants in Wardian cases were supplied\r\nto me by Mr. Weir and Mr. Cross, who acquired their experience in the\r\nvoyages from South America to India; and by Mr. McIvor, who received\r\nthe plants on the Neilgherry hills. The cases were filled with soil to\r\na depth of nine to ten inches, in which the chinchonas were planted\r\nin rows, from the back to the front of the case. The distance from\r\nplant to plant was regulated by their size, but, in the case of their\r\nhaving much foliage, they should be rather wide apart, for the crowding\r\nof foliage is always injurious, and often brings on mildew or mould.\r\nAfter having been planted they were well watered, and shaded from the\r\nglare of the mid-day sun. On the surface of the soil, between each row\r\nof plants, a batten was placed, extending from the back to the front\r\nof the case, and held firmly down by two longer battens extending\r\nlengthways. By this means the soil and plants are not disturbed in the\r\noperation of moving the cases. When the cases are finally closed the\r\nsoil should be in a medium state as regards moisture, and all dead\r\nfoliage should be removed. The cases should be made as air-tight as\r\npossible by filling the seams with putty, and every precaution must\r\nbe taken to preserve the plants from the slightest contact with salt\r\nwater.[387] Mr. McIvor strongly recommends that the cases should be\r\nfurnished with a false bottom, raised about two or three inches above\r\nthe true bottom, by bars of wood of the required thickness being nailed\r\non the underside. The false bottom should have holes bored in it at\r\nregular intervals, with a few broken pieces of pot and a layer of moss\r\nplaced over them. He considers that the best sort of soil is formed of\r\nequal parts of leaf-mould, turfy loam, and sand, mixed in a dry state,\r\nand spread out and exposed to the action of the sun for a few days\r\nbefore being placed in the cases. During the voyage the plants should\r\nhave plenty of light and air, one side of the case being left open for\r\ntwo or three hours, morning and evening, during fine weather, when dead\r\nleaves should be picked off, and water administered to any plant which\r\nmay require it. The soil should be turned up on the surface to the\r\ndepth of about half an inch with a small pointed stick every three or\r\nfour days, and always kept rough on the surface, so as to allow the air\r\nto circulate in the soil. This circulation of air is also facilitated\r\nby the false bottom. The action of the air on the soil keeps the roots\r\nin fine condition, and entirely prevents the formation of mildew and\r\ndamp; but the principal object of the false bottom is to allow any\r\nexcess of water to drain off into a place where it cannot _sour_ the\r\nsoil, and yet will not be lost. Then, as the soil becomes dry above,\r\nthe water will be attracted to it.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the false bottom, all the above suggestions\r\nwere carefully attended to by the gardeners who were in charge of the\r\nchinchona-plants during the voyage to India; the partial failures\r\nwhich attended some of the relays from South America could not, under\r\nthe circumstances, have been avoided by any human foresight; and, as\r\nthe general result of my arrangements has been to introduce all the\r\nvaluable kinds of quinine-yielding plants into India, we have every\r\nreason to congratulate ourselves on the success of our labours.\r\n\r\nWith the chinchona-plants I brought from Peru a supply of seeds of the\r\nchirimoya, of aji-pepper, and of the _Schinus molle_, all of which\r\nare coming up well on the Neilgherry hills.[388] They have most of\r\nthe other kinds of _Anonas_ in India, but the chirimoya fruit, the\r\nmost exquisite of all, has yet to be raised. He who has not tasted\r\nthe chirimoya has yet to learn what fruit is. \"The pine-apple, the\r\nmangosteen, and the chirimoya,\" says Dr. Seemann, \"are considered the\r\nfinest fruits in the world. I have tasted them in those localities\r\nin which they are supposed to attain their highest perfection--the\r\npine-apple in Guayaquil, the mangosteen in the Indian archipelago,\r\nand the chirimoya on the slopes of the Andes; and, if I were called\r\nupon to act the part of a Paris, I would without hesitation assign the\r\napple to the chirimoya. Its taste indeed surpasses that of every other\r\nfruit, and Haenke was quite right when he called it the masterpiece of\r\nnature.\"[389]\r\n\r\nIn obtaining plants and seeds of these valuable chinchonas from South\r\nAmerica, it would be a source of deep regret to me if that measure\r\nwas attended by any injury to the people or the commerce of Peru or\r\nEcuador, countries in the welfare of which I have for years taken the\r\ndeepest interest. But I have no apprehension that such will be the\r\nresult of the cultivation of these plants in other parts of the world.\r\nThe demand for quinine will always be in excess of the supply from\r\nSouth America; and the result of chinchona cultivation in India and\r\nJava will have the effect of lowering the price, and bringing this\r\ninestimable febrifuge within the reach of a vast number of people\r\nwho are now excluded from its use, without in any way injuring the\r\ntrade of Peru and Ecuador. I trust that not only will this measure\r\ndo no injury to the South Americans, but that it may be hereafter\r\nproductive of good to them, as well as to the rest of mankind. Hitherto\r\nthey have destroyed the chinchona-trees in a spirit of reckless\r\nshort-sightedness, and thus done more injury to their own interests\r\nthan could possibly have arisen from any commercial competition; but\r\nit may be that the influence of peace and education will inaugurate a\r\nnew system in time to come, that more enlightened views will prevail,\r\nand that they themselves may undertake the cultivation of a plant\r\nwhich is indigenous to their forests, but which, up to this time, they\r\nhave so foolishly neglected. It will then be a pleasure to supply them\r\nwith the information which will have been gained by the experience of\r\ncultivators in India, and thus to assist them in the establishment of\r\nplantations on the slopes of the eastern Andes.\r\n\r\nUnder any circumstances the South Americans, who owe to India the\r\nstaple food of millions of their people, and to the Old World most of\r\ntheir valuable products--wheat, barley, apples, peaches, sugar-cane,\r\nthe vine, rice, the olive, sheep, cattle, and horses--have no right\r\nto desire to withhold from India a product which is so essentially\r\nnecessary to her welfare. Nor do I believe that the better conditioned\r\nPeruvians have any such desire. On the contrary, many of them have\r\nshown themselves willing to promote a friendly interchange of the\r\nproducts of the New and Old Worlds; and the foolish decree issued in\r\nEcuador on the 1st of May, 1861, as well as the numerous obstructions\r\nthrown in my way in southern Peru, may be imputed either to the\r\nnarrow-minded selfishness of half-educated officials, or to the\r\nignorant patriotism of backwoodsmen. These are feelings which are not\r\nshared by either the educated few, or by the Indian population.\r\n\r\nAfter much careful consideration it had been decided that the best\r\nplace for commencing the experimental cultivation of chinchona-plants\r\nin India would be the Neilgherry hills, in the Madras Presidency. Here\r\nare to be found a climate, an amount of moisture, a vegetation, and\r\nan elevation above the sea, more analogous to those of the chinchona\r\nforests in South America than can be met with in any other part of\r\nIndia. In the Government gardens at Ootacamund, on the Neilgherries,\r\nthere were the necessary conveniences for propagating plants and\r\nraising seedlings; and in Mr. William G. McIvor, the Superintendent,\r\nwas to be found a zealous, intelligent, and practical gardener, who\r\nhad carefully studied the botany of the chinchona genus, and under\r\nwhose care the cultivation would be commenced with the best possible\r\nguarantees for its success.\r\n\r\nFrom the Neilgherries the chinchona-plants will, it is hoped, be\r\nintroduced into such other hill districts of Southern India as, after\r\nexamination, may be found suitable for their growth; and it was a part\r\nof my duty to visit the most promising localities, and, in conjunction\r\nwith Mr. McIvor, to select the sites for chinchona plantations on the\r\nNeilgherry hills. With this object in view we landed at the port of\r\nCalicut, on the coast of Malabar, on the 7th of October, 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAVELS IN INDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nMALABAR.\r\n\r\n  Calicut--Houses and gardens--Population of Malabar--Namburi\r\n  Brahmins--Nairs--Tiars--Slaves--Moplahs--Assessment\r\n  of rice-fields, of gardens, of dry crops--Other\r\n  taxes--Voyage up the Beypoor river--The Conolly teak\r\n  plantations--Wundoor--Backwood cultivation--Sholacul--Sispara\r\n  ghaut--Black-wood--Scenery--Sispara--View of the Nellemboor\r\n  valley--Avalanche--Arrival at Ootacamund.\r\n\r\n\r\nHE who would desire to receive the most pleasant impression of India,\r\non a first arrival, must follow in the wake of Vasco de Gama, and land\r\non the coast of Malabar, the garden of the peninsula. Here Nature\r\nis clad in her brightest and most inviting robes, the scenery is\r\nmagnificent, the fields and gardens speak of plenty, and the dwellings\r\nof the people are substantial and comfortable.\r\n\r\nAs we steamed into the anchorage at Calicut, on board the little yacht\r\n'Pleiad,' no appearance of any town was visible, and no building except\r\na tall white lighthouse. Thick groves of cocoanut-trees line the shore,\r\nand are divided from the sea by a belt of sand; while undulating green\r\nhills rise up behind, and the background of mountains was hidden by\r\nbanks of clouds. The whole scene bore a close resemblance to one of\r\nthe Sandwich or Society Islands, down to the canoes which came off to\r\nus the moment the anchor was let go. They are hewn out of the trunk of\r\nthe jack-tree, with an upper bulwark fastened with coir twine; and the\r\ncanoe-men were naked athletic-looking fellows, with enormous hats made\r\nof a frond of the tallipot palm (_Corypha umbraculifera_). When we\r\nshoved off from the 'Pleiad' a handsome fish-hawk, with white head and\r\nbreast, was perched on the fore-topsail yard-arm, and sea-snakes were\r\nplaying in the water alongside. In-shore there were a few native craft,\r\ncalled _pattamars_, at anchor. Pattamars are the vessels which have\r\ncarried on the coasting trade on the western side of India from time\r\nimmemorial. As in the days of Sinbad the sailor, their planks are not\r\nnailed, but sewn together with coir-twine, and they have high sterns\r\nand bows sheering rapidly aft. The deepest part is at the stem, whence\r\nthe bottom curves inwards to the stern. A pattamar has two masts raking\r\nforward, with long picturesque lateen yards slung with one-third part\r\nbefore the mast, and two-thirds abaft. They never attempt to tack, but\r\nalways ware, and if taken aback there is no alternative but either to\r\nwait until she comes round, or to capsize.\r\n\r\nOn landing at Calicut, a carriage drawn by two white bullocks was,\r\nthrough the hospitality of Mr. Patrick Grant, the Collector of Malabar,\r\nwaiting for us on the sandy beach, to convey us to his house; a\r\ndrive of about two miles. The excellent road, of a bright red colour\r\nfrom the soil being composed of laterite, passes through groves of\r\ncocoanut-trees, interspersed with many houses, each surrounded by\r\nits garden of mangos, nux vomica trees, jacks with pepper-vines\r\ncreeping over them, and palm-trees. The houses are all substantial\r\nand comfortable-looking, built of square blocks of laterite joined\r\nwith _chunam_, or lime made from calcined sea-shells, and roofed with\r\ntiles. The laterite or iron-clay is a rock full of cavities and pores\r\nlike coral, overlying the granite which forms the basis of Malabar.\r\nWhen excluded from the air it is so soft that any iron instrument can\r\nreadily cut it, and is dug up in square masses with a pickaxe, and\r\nafterwards shaped into blocks with a knife or trowel. After exposure\r\nit soon becomes as hard, and is as durable as bricks. Each house has\r\na cocoanut safe or store-room on one side, of open wood-work. Many\r\npeople were walking along the road, naked men with huge tallipot-palm\r\nhats, and women with nothing on but bright-coloured petticoats, looking\r\npicturesque in the foreground and middle distance of the palm-shaded\r\nvistas. At intervals the cocoanut groves were broken by fields of vivid\r\ngreen paddy, and tanks filled with red lotus-flowers.\r\n\r\nFrom Mr. Grant's house, on the top of a rounded grassy hill, there is\r\nan extensive and very beautiful view of the undulating hills and dales\r\nof Malabar, generally covered with forest; with the ocean on one side,\r\nand the Wynaad mountains on the other. Malabar is 188 miles long, 25\r\nmiles broad in the northern, and 70 in the southern half, and contains\r\n6262 square miles. It is divided into 17 _Talooks_ or districts, and\r\nhas a population of 1,602,914 souls; of whom 1,165,174 are Hindus,\r\n414,126 Moplahs, and 23,614 Christians.\r\n\r\nThe people of Malabar are a thriving active race, the men well built\r\nand handsome, and the women remarkable for their beauty. The highest\r\ncaste among the Hindus is that of the Namburi Brahmins, who claim all\r\nthe land below the ghauts, and appear to have actually possessed a\r\nlarge portion of it previous to the invasion of Hyder Ali of Mysore.\r\nThey declare that when Parasu Rama, one of the incarnations of Vishnu,\r\nhurled his axe from the mountains, the ocean receded, leaving the\r\nland of Kerala, as Malabar, Cochin, and Travancore were called; which\r\nhe gave to the Namburi Brahmins. It is true that the undulating\r\nflat-topped hills, which cover the part of Malabar near Calicut, are\r\nlike the waves of the sea, and appear as if the ocean in receding had\r\nforced channels, and thus formed the intervening valleys. The Namburis\r\nare fast dying out: they are landed proprietors, and perform such\r\noffices as bestowing holy water and ashes, or performing _poojah_ or\r\nworship for the other Hindus, but never enter the public service.\r\n\r\nThe most important portion of the population is included in the eleven\r\nclasses of Nairs,[390] a race of pure Sudra caste. They pretend to be\r\nborn soldiers, and formed the armies of the Zamorin and Cochin Rajahs,\r\nthe lower castes not being allowed to bear arms. The Nairs now hold\r\nmost of the land in Malabar, and are frequently very rich. Both the\r\nZamorin of Calicut and the Rajah of Cochin are Nairs; and the origin\r\nof their rule is said to have been as follows. About a thousand years\r\nago, a Viceroy of the Sholum Rajah ruled over Malabar, named Cheruman\r\nPermal, who made himself independent, and divided the country among his\r\nnobles, of whom five were of the Kshatri caste, and seven were Nairs.\r\nAfter the division it was found that one of his bravest officers, the\r\nancestor of the present Zamorin or Tamori Rajah, had been left out;\r\nCheruman Permal, therefore, gave him his sword, and all the territory\r\nin which a cock crowing at a certain small temple could be heard.\r\nHence Calicut, from _Colicodu_, a cock-crowing.[391] Down to the time\r\nof Tippoo the whole of Malabar was governed by the descendants of the\r\nsisters of these thirteen Nair chiefs. The Zamorin of Calicut has some\r\ninfluence, though he is much reduced in wealth and importance since the\r\ndays of Vasco de Gama.\r\n\r\nThe Nairs live under the remarkable institution called\r\n_murroo-muka-tayum_. Sisters never leave their homes, but receive\r\nvisits from male acquaintances, and the brothers go out to other\r\nhouses, to their lady-loves, but live with their sisters. If a younger\r\nbrother settles in a new house, he takes his favourite sister with him,\r\nand not the woman who, according to the custom in all other countries,\r\nshould keep house for him. The man's mother manages the house, and\r\nafter her death his eldest sister takes her place; but no man has any\r\nidea who his father is, and the children of his sisters are his heirs.\r\nMoveable property is divided amongst the children of the sisters of the\r\ndeceased equally, and the land is managed by the eldest male of the\r\nfamily, but each individual has a right to a share in the income.\r\n\r\nThis strange custom gives the women an important position; and as\r\nthey are pretty, and take pains with their personal appearance, their\r\ninfluence is very great. The Nairs are addicted to drink, and may eat\r\nvenison, fowls, and fish; and the families are fond of gaiety, and of\r\nvisiting among people of their own rank, when there is much talking\r\nand singing. Most of the men, as well as the women, read and write\r\nin their own character, and there is a Government Gazette printed in\r\nthe Malayalim language. The Collector was anxious, also, to establish\r\na paper in Malayalim, containing general information, which would no\r\ndoubt have an excellent effect, but the difficulty is to find a good\r\nnative editor.\r\n\r\nNext in rank to the Nairs come the _Tiars_ or _Shanars_, a stout,\r\ngood-looking, hard-working race, who do not pretend to Sudra origin.\r\nFormerly the Nairs exacted deference from the Tiars with extreme\r\ncruelty and arrogance, treating them more like brutes than men; and if\r\na Tiar defiled a Nair by touching him, he was instantly cut down. But\r\nBritish rule is gradually uprooting these caste barbarisms, and the\r\nposition of the Tiars is improving. Some of them hold appointments as\r\nclerks in Government offices, and they are protected by just and equal\r\nlaws. The Tiars form the mass of the field labourers; but the proper\r\nduty of their caste is to extract juice from the palm-tree, and either\r\nboil it into _jaggery_ (unrefined sugar), or distil it. Their women are\r\nexceedingly pretty, with masses of long hair; but there is a prevalent\r\ncustom for all the brothers of a family to have but one wife amongst\r\nthem to save expense, which leads to most disastrous consequences.\r\nBelow the Tiars there are several outcast tribes; among them the\r\n_Churmas_ or slaves, a miserable and down-trodden race, possibly the\r\nremnant of the aboriginal inhabitants. Even now they are slow to\r\nunderstand that they are not slaves, and land on which there are most\r\n_Churmas_ still sells at the highest price.\r\n\r\nThe _Moplahs_, or Mohammedans of Malabar, are descended from Arab\r\nmariners and traders by native women, and hence their name, from\r\n_Mah-pilla_ \"son of the mother.\" They have certainly been established\r\nin Malabar for a thousand years, if not more, as it is on record that\r\nthe Viceroy Cheruman Permal, who then divided the country amongst\r\nhis chiefs, was converted by a Moplah, and sailed for Mecca. All the\r\nsympathies of the Moplahs are with Arabia and the Red Sea, and they\r\nfrequently undertake pilgrimages to Mecca. Respecting their creed\r\nthey are fanatical, and are easily roused to fury by an insult, or\r\nan attempt on the part of the Nairs to treat them as a lower caste.\r\nOn these occasions they run mucks; but in ordinary times they are\r\nhard-working, intelligent, abstemious, excellent boatmen, and capital\r\nbackwoodsmen. Many of the Moplahs are very wealthy. Their mosques,\r\nhowever, are poor edifices, not to be distinguished from ordinary\r\ndwelling-houses, and the temples of the Hindus are no better. There is\r\nno attempt at ornamental architecture in the religious buildings of\r\nMalabar.\r\n\r\nOne-fifth of the collectorate of Malabar is taken up with rice and\r\ngarden cultivation, the remaining four-fifths being covered with\r\nforest, or cleared for dry grains and coffee plantations. The land\r\nrevenue, taking the average of five years ending in 1858-59, is\r\n255,000_l._ The assessment of the rice-lands is essentially the\r\nsame as that fixed by the Government of Tippoo Sultan of Mysore in\r\n1783-84. Though unequal, and in some places burdensome, it is on the\r\nwhole light, and, except in two of the Talooks,[392] it is lighter in\r\nthe north than in the south. As an example of the inequality of the\r\nland-tax, I may mention that the district of Pattaumby, on the river\r\nPonany, is very highly and unfairly assessed, as it is said, from\r\nthe following cause. Before the invasion of Tippoo all the land in\r\nMalabar was in the hands of feudal chiefs; there was no land-tax, and\r\nthe Zamorin and other Rajahs were supported by the produce of their\r\nown estates. The first ruler who imposed a land-tax was the Mysore\r\nconqueror. Any village which offended his officers was highly assessed;\r\nand hence the present inequalities, which will, however, be corrected\r\nby the new Survey and Assessment Commission. In the case of Pattaumby\r\nthe accountant quarrelled with the landowners, and threatened to impose\r\na heavy assessment, and, when they attempted to murder him, he escaped\r\nto Wynaad, and sent in his report to Tippoo.\r\n\r\nAll land in Malabar is private property, and the landlord gets 20 to 40\r\nper cent. of the net rent, the remainder being the Government demand.\r\nFrom the gross produce of the rice-fields 20 per cent. is deducted\r\nfor reaping and other small charges called _puddum_, the remainder\r\nbeing available gross rent. From the gross rent one-third is deducted\r\nas the expense of cultivation, called _vitoo vally_; one third as the\r\ncultivator's share, or _koshoo labon_, whether he be a _jemakar_ or\r\nproprietor, a _kanomkar_ or mortgagee, or a _pattamkar_ or renter; and\r\nthe remaining third is the _pattom_, net produce, or rent. Of this\r\nlast third the Government share is 65 per cent., leaving 35 per cent.\r\nas the share of the proprietor. The Government share is thus a little\r\nless than a quarter of the gross produce.\r\n\r\nThe assessment is not calculated on the extent of land, but on the\r\namount of seed required to sow a given space, according to the quality\r\nof the soil, which is divided into three classes, namely _pasma_\r\n(clay), _rasee pasma_ (sand and clay), and _rasee_ (sand). On an\r\naverage the soil does not yield more than tenfold, and most of it bears\r\nonly one crop. Some lands are sown in April or May, and the crops cut\r\nin August or September. These are chiefly in the coast Talooks. Others\r\nare sown in September and October, and the crops cut in January and\r\nFebruary. The seeds are raised on small pieces of land, and the plants,\r\nwhen young, removed by hand, and planted in the paddy-fields.\r\n\r\nThe garden assessment, as it is called, on cocoanut-trees, the great\r\nwealth of Malabar, betel-palms, and jacks, was fixed in 1820.\r\n\r\nThe cocoanut-trees are divided according to their situations and soils\r\ninto five classes--the first and second classes being _attivepoo_, or\r\nsea-coast; and the third, fourth, and fifth, _karavepoo_, or inland\r\ncocoanut-trees. Each tree pays, on an average, eighteen pies,[393]\r\nthose which are unproductive from age or youth being excluded. The\r\nbetel-nut palms pay, on an average, six pies, and the jack-trees\r\ntwenty-eight pies; but the tax on gardens is not more than forty per\r\ncent. of the landlord's rent. A cocoanut-tree is estimated to bear at\r\nleast sixteen to forty nuts in the year, according to its site; and the\r\nowner of a plantation derives profit from the leaves as well as from\r\nthe husks and shells of the nut. The leaves, used for covering houses,\r\nsell at two and a half to five Rs. the thousand, each tree yielding\r\nten to fifteen annually; and the husks, for coir ropes, fetch six annas\r\nthe thousand.[394]\r\n\r\nThe betel-nut palm (_Areca catechu_), which is also taxed has a\r\nlong slender smooth stem, and graceful curving fronds. I have seen\r\npalm-trees in the South Sea islands, many kinds in the forests of South\r\nAmerica, and in India; but, of the whole tribe, the betel-nut palm is\r\ncertainly the most elegant and beautiful. Dr. Hooker likens it \"to an\r\narrow shot from heaven, raising its graceful head and feathery crown in\r\nluxuriance and beauty above the verdant slopes.\" A tree will produce\r\n300 nuts in the year, and continues to bear for twenty-five years.\r\nThe nut is very hard, the size of a cherry, and is chewed by all the\r\nnatives of India with the leaves of the betel-pepper (_Chavica betel_)\r\nspread with _chunam_. It is cut into long narrow pieces, and rolled up\r\nin the leaves of the betel-pepper or pawn. It makes the mouth and teeth\r\nred, and gives the chewer a disgusting appearance. The consumption\r\nmust be enormous, for it is chewed by 50,000,000 of men, and, next to\r\ntobacco, is the most extensively used narcotic; but it has none of the\r\nexcellent properties of the coca-leaf of the Peruvians.\r\n\r\nThe jack (_Artocarpus integrifolius_), the only other tree which\r\nis taxed in Malabar, grows to a considerable size, and the wood is\r\nmuch used for furniture of all kinds. The fruit, a favourite article\r\nof food, is of enormous dimensions, and grows out of the trunk. In\r\nTravancore they put the whole fruit in the ground, and, when the young\r\nshoots grow up, the stems are tied together with straw, and by degrees\r\nthey form one stem, bearing fruit in six or seven years.[395] Besides\r\nthe taxed trees, the gardens round Calicut generally contain mangos and\r\nnux vomica.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the rice or wet cultivation, and the above-mentioned\r\ntrees, the upland or dry cultivation of rice and sesame or gingelee\r\noil-seed is assessed on an annual inspection: forty per cent. of the\r\ngross produce of the former being deducted, on account of the peculiar\r\nlabour and probable loss, and twenty per cent. of the remainder being\r\nthe Government share. The sesame cultivation has no deduction from the\r\ngross produce; and ginger, pepper, and some other dry crops are free\r\nof land-tax. The pepper cultivation is chiefly carried on in northern\r\nMalabar, and ginger in the Shernaad district, south of Calicut, by the\r\nMoplahs.[396]\r\n\r\nThe other taxes are _abkarry_, or the privilege of selling\r\nliquors, which is either farmed by public sale, or levied from the\r\ntoddy-drawers, when it is called _kutty-chatty_ (knife and pot) tax;\r\n_mohturfa_ on houses, shops, fishing-boats, oil-mills, and looms;\r\nlicences, stamps, and the salt monopoly; the whole revenue of Malabar\r\nin 1859 having been 266,860_l._ The income-tax had not yet been levied\r\nat the time of our visit, but its nature had been carefully explained\r\nto the people, it had been stripped of everything that was offensive or\r\ninquisitorial, and no difficulty was anticipated in its introduction,\r\nalthough it was very generally considered that it was unwise and\r\nimpolitic, and that it would be unproductive. In the matter of taxes\r\nthere was a striking contrast between Peru, whence we had just come,\r\nand where they are scarcely known, and this land of manifold imposts.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, however, Malabar is a splendid possession; the people are\r\nvery flourishing, the population increasing, and cultivation rapidly\r\nencroaching on the forests. There is no gang robbery, but occasional\r\nhousebreaking, and a good many murders, often caused by jealousy,\r\nthe criminals usually making a full confession, and thus saving much\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we embarked in a canoe which had been prepared for us\r\nnear the fine timber bridge over the Calicut river, on the road to\r\nBeypoor. The setting sun and banks of rosy clouds were visible through\r\nthe graceful fronds of the cocoanut-trees as we drove along the shady\r\nroad, with occasional glimpses of the sea. The canoe was very long,\r\nand cut out of one trunk, with raised bow and stern, ornamentally\r\ncarved. It was pulled by four tall wiry-looking Moplahs, with nothing\r\non but clouts and huge umbrella-hats, made of the tallipot palm;[397]\r\nand a fifth steered with a paddle. Their oars were long bamboos, with\r\ncircular boards fastened to one end by neat coir seizings. We started a\r\nlittle after sunset, and passed from the Calicut river by a backwater\r\ninto the Beypoor, where there were many shallow places, and the Moplahs\r\nhad constantly to jump out and drag the canoe over them. The banks of\r\nthe river are wooded down to the water's edge, with groves of slender\r\nbetel-nut palms rising aloft, and standing out against the starry sky.\r\nThe foliage was covered with brilliant fire-flies, and here and there\r\nwe passed a hut, with its owner standing on the shore, waving a burning\r\nbrand. All night the boatmen sang noisy glees, and in the morning we\r\nreached the landing-place at Eddiwanna, forty miles from Calicut, and\r\nnear the Government teak plantations of Nellamboor.\r\n\r\nThese plantations were originated by Mr. Conolly, the late Collector\r\nof Malabar, with a view to the establishment of nurseries for\r\nreplenishing the teak forests, as nearly all the fine timber had been\r\nfelled many years ago. There is a great deal in North Canara of small\r\nsize, and still more in Cochin and Travancore; but the reckless system\r\nof felling threatened the same results as has already overtaken the\r\nsupply of chinchona-bark in South America. The only forests containing\r\nteak, in Malabar, in which Government has a proprietary right, are\r\n25 square miles in the Palghat talook, where all the mature trees\r\nhave long since gone to the Bombay dockyard; but in 1842 leases of\r\nforest-land were obtained from the Zamorin for the cultivation of\r\nteak, 70 to 80 square miles in extent, chiefly in the Ernaad talook,\r\nnear Nellamboor. This most important and now successful measure is\r\ndue to the zeal and perseverance of Mr. Conolly, and there is a good\r\nprospect of the stock of teak-timber in these forests being eventually\r\nreplenished. The trees, however, require a growth of 60 or 80 years\r\nto reach a maturity fitting the wood for shipbuilding; but it is then\r\nunequalled by any other known timber; it does not injure iron, and is\r\nnot liable to shrink in width.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before the method of inducing the teak-seeds to\r\ngerminate was discovered, and several experiments were tried. In\r\nthe forests it was observed that the seeds were prepared for growth\r\nby losing the hard outer shell through the warmth caused by fires\r\nwhich annually consume the brushwood. Mr. Conolly, therefore, burnt a\r\ncoating of hay over the ground where the seeds were sown. This trial\r\nwas unsuccessful, and in 1843 it was found that the best method was to\r\nsteep the nuts in water for thirty-six hours, then sow them in holes\r\nfour inches apart, and half an inch under the surface, covering the\r\nbeds with straw, so as to prevent evaporation, and gently watering\r\nthem every evening. By following this plan the seeds germinated, and\r\nsprouted in from four to eight weeks. In 1844 as many as 50,000 young\r\ntrees, raised in the adjacent nurseries, were planted, eight feet\r\napart, in the cleared ground near Nellamboor, along the banks of the\r\nBeypoor river, which had been cleared of jungle. The seedlings are\r\ntransplanted from the nursery at the age of three months, and for the\r\nfirst seven or eight years they sprout up very fast, but afterwards\r\nthey grow slowly. From 1843 to 1859 as many as 1,200,000 trees have\r\nbeen put down, and they are now planted at the rate of 70,000 a year.\r\nMuch care is required in systematic thinning and pruning, and, for the\r\nsuperintendence of this important work, an annual visit is paid to the\r\nplantations by Mr. McIvor, who is now so ably conducting the chinchona\r\nexperiment on the Neilgherry hills.\r\n\r\nWe were met by Mr. McIvor at Eddiwanna, and started for the village\r\nof Wundoor, six miles distant, in _munsheels_ or hammocks, slung to\r\nbamboos with a shade over them, and carried by six men, who kept up\r\nunearthly yells the whole time. The road leads through rice-cultivation\r\nand groves of betel-nut palms, jacks, and mangos. Wundoor is a\r\npretty village, with an avenue of sumach-trees[398] leading up to\r\nthe post-house or travellers' bungalow. These post-houses, which\r\nare erected by the Government at easy stages along all the roads in\r\nIndia, for the convenience of travellers, are exceedingly comfortable,\r\nand render travelling in India as easy and commodious as it is the\r\nreverse in Peru and other parts of South America. At Wundoor the first\r\nbungalow we had seen put an end to all idea of having to rough it while\r\ntravelling in India. The building contained several clean rooms, with\r\ncane-bottom sofas, arm-chairs, and tables; and outside there was a\r\npleasant verandah, with a glorious view of the Koondah mountains, which\r\nit was necessary to ascend on our road to the Neilgherries. A clump of\r\ntrees, consisting of jacks, mangos, and peepuls, formed a huge arch,\r\nthrough which there was an enchanting landscape of smiling hill and\r\ndale, with the dense forest beyond, crowned by the broken outline of\r\nthe distant mountains.\r\n\r\nWe set out from Wundoor at daybreak, and passed a house just outside\r\nthe village, where, a few days before, a tiger had carried off a child\r\nbefore the eyes of its parents. Next day the brute had the temerity\r\nto come again and try to force open the door, when a man shot it\r\nfrom the window. For some hours we rode through a country where the\r\njungle alternated with cultivation in open glades, which in their\r\nnatural state are covered with _Pandanus_, but the people here, as\r\nin other parts of Malabar, are fast encroaching on the forest, and\r\nconverting these glades into paddy-fields. As we approached the foot\r\nof the mountains cultivation at last entirely ceased, and the road led\r\nthrough a dense forest of enormous bamboos, teak-trees with their large\r\ncoarse leaves, black-wood, and other fine timber. At noon we reached\r\nthe post-house of Sholacul, at the foot of the Sispara ghaut, which\r\nleads up to the summit of the Koondahs, a western continuation of the\r\nNeilgherries.\r\n\r\nThe building at Sholacul was surrounded by a very stout pallisade,\r\nto protect it from the wild elephants, who strongly object to all\r\nencroachments on their domain; and even take the trouble of pulling\r\nup the wooden milestones by the side of the roads. We found all the\r\nroads which we travelled over in Malabar excellent, and the ascent\r\nof the Sispara ghaut, though only a zigzag bridle-path, is in very\r\ngood order. After leaving Sholacul the road first passes through a\r\nregion of gigantic reeds, and then through a belt of black-wood,\r\npalms, and tree-ferns, with an undergrowth of _Curcumas_, ferns, and a\r\nbrilliant purple flower (_Torenia Asiatica_). The black or rose-wood\r\ntree (_Dalbergia latifolia_) grows to a height of about fifty feet,\r\nwith handsome spreading branches, and pinnate leaves. The timber is\r\nvery valuable; it is extensively used in Bombay for making beautiful\r\ncarved furniture, and planks are sometimes obtained four feet broad,\r\nafter the sap-wood has been removed. In consequence of the increasing\r\nprice, Dr. Cleghorn, the able and energetic Conservator of Forests in\r\nthe Madras Presidency, has caused a number of seedlings to be planted\r\nat Nellamboor; and plantations have also been formed in N. Canara and\r\nMysore.\r\n\r\nThe occasional openings in the forests, at turns in the road,\r\nafforded us views of the mountains below us covered with the richest\r\nvegetation, and of the rice-fields of Malabar stretching away to the\r\nfaintly indicated blending of sea and haze on the horizon; which\r\nalmost equalled in beauty the finest parts of the eastern Andes. From\r\nabout 1000 to 5000 feet above the sea the jungle is covered with\r\ninnumerable leeches, which eagerly fasten on their prey, whether men,\r\nhorses, or dogs, and make a journey through this region, in the wet\r\nseason, exceedingly disagreeable. Within this leech-zone there is a\r\nconsiderable clearing called Walla-ghaut, planted with coffee, which is\r\nin a ruinous and abandoned state, chiefly owing to the difficulty of\r\ninducing labourers to venture among the leeches. As we continued the\r\nascent, the scenery increased in magnificence, the views became more\r\nextensive, and there were mountain-tops crowned with glorious forest\r\ntrees far below us. At 6000 feet mosses appear, then lilies, brambles,\r\nand wild strawberries, and occasionally we crossed noisy little streams\r\novershadowed by the trees. We reached the Sispara bungalow, on the\r\nsummit of the ghaut, 6742 feet above the level of the sea, late in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nThe Sispara ghaut takes the traveller from the tropical plains to the\r\ntemperate climate of the hills, where the face of nature is entirely\r\nchanged. Here the hills are covered with grass, and the ravines only\r\nare filled with trees, forming thickets called _sholas_. In the rear of\r\nthe bungalow there is an almost unrivalled view of the Malabar plains,\r\nfrom the edge of a precipice. The Koondah hills sweep round until they\r\njoin the Wynaads, half encircling the Nellamboor valley, which was\r\nthousands of feet below us, and is covered with forest, intersected\r\nin all directions by open glades of a rich light green. The Koondahs\r\nrise up from Malabar like perpendicular walls, so steep that even a cat\r\ncould not scale them in any part, for a distance of forty miles; and\r\nthe grandeur of the view from this point, with these sublime cliffs,\r\nand the vast expanse of forest-covered plain below, is very striking.\r\n\r\nAt daylight next morning we left the Sispara bungalow, and rode\r\nfor several miles through a valley interspersed with _sholas_ of\r\nrhododendron-trees. Eighteen miles from Sispara is the Avalanche\r\nbungalow, 6720 feet above the sea, whence there is a good carriage-road\r\nto Ootacamund, the chief European station on the Neilgherry hills. At\r\nAvalanche the Koondah range is considered to cease, and the Neilgherry\r\nhills to commence, but the nature of the country is the same. Between\r\nAvalanche and Ootacamund, a distance of 15 miles, the country consists\r\nof grassy undulating rounded hills, divided from each other by wooded\r\n_sholas_. Herds of fine buffaloes were grazing by the roadside, and\r\nhere and there we saw patches of millet (_Setaria Italica_) near the\r\nhuts of the natives of these hills. As we rode round the artificial\r\nlake, and, passing several pretty little houses surrounded by\r\nshrubberies, stopped at the door of Dawson's hotel at Ootacamund,\r\nit was difficult to persuade ourselves that we were not again in\r\nEngland. The garden in front of the house was stocked with mignonette,\r\nwallflowers, and fuchsias, but the immense bushes of heliotrope covered\r\nwith flowers, ten feet high and at least twenty in circumference, could\r\nnot have attained such dimensions in an English climate. Ootacamund is\r\nnearly in the centre of the table-land of the Neilgherries, at the foot\r\nof the western face of the peak of Dodabetta, and, except to the N.W.,\r\nthe station is completely surrounded by grass-covered hills. Houses\r\nare scattered about under the shelter of the hills, with gardens and\r\nplantations of _Eucalyptus_ and _Acacia heterophylla_, trees introduced\r\nfrom Australia, around them; and the broad excellent roads are bordered\r\nby _Cassia glauca_ bushes with a bright orange flower, honeysuckles,\r\nfox-gloves, geraniums, roses, and masses of the tall _Lobelia excelsa_.\r\nA graceful white iris is also common.\r\n\r\nThis charming spot, now that the roads are planted with tall trees, and\r\nthe hedges filled with all the familiar flowers introduced from old\r\nEngland, while curling smoke ascends through the foliage, and suggests\r\nthe idea of chimneys and warm firesides, is as unlike India, and as\r\nlike an English watering-place, as can be imagined. The tower of the\r\nchurch, seen from many points of view, increases the resemblance, which\r\nis certainly not lessened by the rosy cheeks and healthy looks of the\r\nchildren, and the fresh invigorating mountain air. But when a few miles\r\nfrom the station, and out of sight of all English associations, there\r\nwas much that reminded me of the _pajonales_ in the chinchona region of\r\nCaravaya at a first glance: and I felt sanguine that all the _pajonal_\r\nchinchona-trees would thrive in most of the _sholas_ on the Neilgherry\r\nhills, while suitable sites for those species which require a warmer\r\nclimate would be found in the forest slopes which overlook the plains.\r\nA closer inspection confirmed me in this opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nNEILGHERRY HILLS.\r\n\r\n  Extent--Formation--Soil--Climate--Flora--Hill\r\n  tribes--Todars--Antiquities--Badagas--Koters--Kurumbers--Irulas\r\n  --English stations--Kotergherry--Ootacamund--Coonoor--Jakatalla\r\n  --Government gardens at Ootacamund and Kalhutty--Mr. McIvor--Coffee\r\n  cultivation--Rules for sale of waste lands--Forest conservancy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Neilgherry[399] hills, between latitude 11° 10' and 11° 32' N., and\r\nlongitude 76° 59' and 77° 31' E., form the most elevated mountain mass\r\nin India, south of the Himalayas; the highest peak, that of Dodabetta,\r\nbeing 8610 feet above the level of the sea. They are isolated on three\r\nsides, and rise up abruptly from the plains of Coimbatore on the south,\r\nand from the table-lands of Wynaad and Mysore on the north and east,\r\nto a height of 6000 feet above the former, and 2000 to 3000 above the\r\nlatter; from which they are divided by the broad ravine of the river\r\nMoyaar. On the west they are united with the Koondah range, which is\r\na continuation of the western ghauts. The area of the Neilgherries\r\ncontains 268,494 acres, of which 24,000 are under cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe formation consists of syenitic granite, with veins of basaltic\r\nrock, hornblende, and quartz, while, in some parts, half-decomposed\r\nlaterite underlies the soil. The plateau is not a flat table-land, but\r\na succession of undulating hills and intervening grassy valleys, with\r\nravines thickly wooded, numerous streams, and occasional rocky ridges\r\nrunning up into fine mountain-peaks. The streams all go to swell the\r\ngreat river Cauvery, by its tributaries the Moyaar and Bowany; the\r\nMoyaar descending from the hills by a fine waterfall at Neddiwuttum, on\r\nthe northern slope; and the Bowany flowing down between the Koondahs\r\nand Neilgherries to the south. The soil of the plateau is very rich,\r\nbeing formed by the decomposition of basaltic and hornblende rocks,\r\nmixed with the clayey products of the granite, and much decomposed\r\nvegetable matter. The latter consists of the grass killed down to the\r\nroots by the frost, washed in by the succeeding rains, and mixed with\r\nthe subsoil, increasing its richness and depth season after season. The\r\nrichest land is on the lower slopes, where there are accumulations of\r\nsoil washed from the hills above:[400] and there are extensive deposits\r\nof peat in the valleys, which afford supplies of fuel. The chief defect\r\nin the soil is the absence of lime.\r\n\r\nThe temperature and amount of humidity vary according to the locality.\r\nAt Ootacamund, 7300 feet above the sea, the means of the thermometer\r\nrange from 42° to 68°, while in the two other lower and warmer stations\r\nof Coonoor and Kotergherry, about 6000 feet above the sea, the range\r\nis from 52° to 71°. The annual rainfall at Ootacamund is sixty inches,\r\nat Coonoor fifty-five inches, and at Kotergherry fifty inches. During\r\nthe south-west monsoon, from May to September, the rain comes down in\r\ntorrents at Sispara, and in the western parts of the Neilgherries,\r\nbut their force is somewhat exhausted before reaching Ootacamund, in\r\nthe centre of the plateau. At that station the rainfall, during the\r\nsouth-west monsoon, is about thirty-four inches; and the range of\r\nDodabetta, which rises up like a wall, immediately to the eastward of\r\nOotacamund, almost entirely screens the eastern part of the hills from\r\nthe rains of the south-west monsoon, and there the rainfall is only\r\ntwelve inches from May to September. During the portion of the year\r\nfrom October to April the western parts of the hills are comparatively\r\ndry, the prevalent winds are from the north-east, and the rains which\r\nthey bring with them from the Madras coast do not extend farther west\r\nthan the neighbourhood of Ootacamund. Kotergherry, and the eastern\r\nparts of the hills, receive the full benefit of the rains from the\r\nnorth-east monsoon, but they are not heavy, and the rainfall at\r\nKotergherry, in that season, is thirty-eight inches. Ootacamund also\r\ngets some of the rain of the north-east monsoon (thirty-six inches),\r\nso that, in that central part of the plateau, there is a belt which\r\nreceives a moderate supply of rain throughout the year. In January and\r\nDecember there are frosts in the night, and the extreme radiation which\r\ngoes on in the valleys causes great cold at sunrise; but these frosts\r\nare confined to the valleys in the upper plateau, and they never visit\r\nthe higher slopes, or the well-wooded \"_sholas_.\"\r\n\r\nThe climates of the Neilgherry hills are the most delightful in the\r\nworld; and it may be said of this salubrious region, with its equable\r\nseasons, what the Persian poet said of Kung, \"the warmth is not\r\nheat, and the coolness is not cold.\"[401] On the open plateau, in\r\nthe wooded _sholas_, and in the thick forests of the lower slopes,\r\nthere is a great variety of beautiful flowering trees and shrubs; and\r\nthe vegetation of the hills is both varied and luxuriant. First, in\r\nthe brilliant splendour of its flowers, must be mentioned the tree\r\nrhododendron (_Rhododendron arboreum_), which is very common in all\r\nparts of the hills, either forming small thickets or dotted about on\r\nthe grassy slopes. It grows to a height of twenty feet, with a gnarled\r\nstunted trunk, and masses of deep crimson flowers. In the \"sholas\" are\r\nthe _Michelia nilagiraca_, a large tree, with yellowish-white fragrant\r\nflowers of great size; the _Symplocos pulchra_, with hairy leaves and\r\nsnow-white flowers; the _Ilex Wightiana_, a large umbrageous tree,\r\nwith small white flowers and red berries; the pretty pink-flowered\r\n_Rhodo-myrtus tomentosa_, the berries of which are called \"hill\r\ngooseberries;\" the _Jasminum revolutum_, a shrub with sweet yellow\r\nflowers; the _Sapota elingoides_, a fine forest-tree, with rough\r\ncracked bark, and an edible fruit used in curries; _Crotalariæ_;\r\n_Bignoniæ_; peppers, cinnamon, a number of chinchonaceous shrubs, and\r\nmany others.\r\n\r\nIn the open grassy slopes and near the edges of the wooded ravines\r\nare several _Vaccinia_, especially the _Vaccinium Leschenaultii_,\r\na shrub with pretty rose-coloured flowers; the beautiful _Osbeckia\r\nGardneriana_, with a profusion of large purple flowers; the handsome\r\n_Viburnum Wightianum_; a number of balsams (_Impatiens_ of several\r\nspecies); the _Gaultheria Leschenaultii_ in great quantities, a pretty\r\nlittle shrub with white flowers and blue berries; the _Berberis\r\nMahonia_, with its glossy prickly leaves and long slender racemes of\r\nyellow flowers; and the bright little pink _Indigofera pulchella_;\r\nwhile the climbing passion-flower (_Passiflora Leschenaultii_) hangs in\r\nfestoons over the trees, especially in the eastern parts of the hills.\r\nAmong the more inconspicuous plants are the _Gallium requienianum_;\r\nthe _Rubia cordifolia_;[402] the thorny _Solanum ferox_, with stem\r\nand leaves covered with strong straight prickles; the _Girardinia\r\nLeschenaultii_,[403] or Neilgherry nettle, a most virulent stinger;\r\nthe tall _Lobelia excelsa_; a _Justitia_, with a blue flower, which\r\nentirely covers some of the hills; some pretty _Sonerilas_; several\r\nbeautiful _Ipomœas_ and _lilies; elsias_; and the _Hypericum\r\nHookerianum_, growing plentifully in the meadows, with large orange\r\nflowers; besides ferns, lycopods, and numberless small wild flowers in\r\nthe grass and underwood.\r\n\r\nEnjoying a delightful climate, well supplied with water, and with\r\nits gentle undulations of hill and dale in some places clothed with\r\nrich pasture, in others presenting woods of fine timber and beautiful\r\nflowering shrubs, the Neilgherry hills are eminently fitted for the\r\nabode of a thriving and civilized people. Yet for many centuries\r\nit would appear that their sole inhabitants were a strange race of\r\ncowherds, a people differing in all respects from their neighbours in\r\nthe plains, and indeed from all the other natives of Hindostan.\r\n\r\nThese are the Todars, a race numbering less than a thousand souls, who\r\nnow claim to be the original \"Lords of the hills.\" In times so remote\r\nthat no record of them remains there are still indications that the\r\nIndian peninsula was peopled by races of Scythic origin: and, when\r\nthe Aryan warriors came forth with their Vedic hymns and grand old\r\ncivilization from the fastnesses of Sind, they swept irresistibly over\r\nHindostan, and formed as it were an upper stratum of the population.\r\nThe Scythic element either mixed with, or became subservient to the\r\nAryan in the plains, as the Sudra caste, while in the hill and forest\r\nfastnesses a few tribes remained isolated and independent. Such,\r\npossibly, may have been the origin of the Todars on the Neilgherries.\r\nThe Brahmins, characteristically dovetailing every tradition and every\r\nrace into one or other of their historical myths, declare that the\r\nTodars came from the north in the army of Rama, when he marched against\r\nthe wicked Ravana; and that, deserting their chief, they fled to these\r\nhills. They themselves have no tradition of their origin, but believe\r\nthat they were created on the hills.\r\n\r\nThey are certainly a very remarkable and interesting people, tall,\r\nwell-proportioned, and athletic, and utterly unlike all other natives\r\nof India. They have Jewish features, with aquiline noses, hazel eyes,\r\nthick lips, bushy black beards, and immensely thick clusters of glossy\r\nhair cut so as to stand in dense masses round the sides of the head, a\r\nvery necessary protection from the sun, as they never wear any other\r\nhead-covering. The old men are very handsome, with long white beards\r\nand upright gait, looking like the patriarchs of the Old Testament,\r\nwith their strongly marked Jewish features: but the expressions of\r\nthe younger men are less agreeable to look upon. The women are very\r\ncareful of their hair, which hangs down in long glossy ringlets; and\r\nboth sexes wear nothing but a long piece of coarse cotton cloth, with\r\ntwo broad red stripes round the edges, worn by the men like a Roman\r\ntoga, which sets off their well-shaped limbs to advantage, and exposes\r\none leg entirely, up to the hip; and by the women so as to form a short\r\npetticoat and mantle. They never wash either their persons or their\r\nclothes from the day of their birth to the day of their death. They\r\nlive in small encampments called _munds_, which are scattered over the\r\nhills, and consist of five or six huts, and a larger one used as a\r\ndairy. The families are in the habit of migrating from one _mund_ to\r\nanother, at certain seasons of the year; so that we often came upon a\r\n_mund_ apparently abandoned. A Todar's hut is exactly like the tilt of\r\na waggon, very neatly roofed, with the ends boarded in, and a single\r\nlow entrance. They are generally surrounded by a stone wall, and the\r\ndairy, a larger and more important building, is always a little apart.\r\nThe only occupation of this singular people is to tend their large\r\nherds of fine buffaloes; they live on milk, and on the grain which they\r\ncollect as a due or _goodoo_ from the other hill tribes, and pass the\r\ngreater part of their time in idleness; lolling about and gossiping\r\nin their munds, or strolling over the hills. We passed through one of\r\nthese munds, about a quarter of a mile from our hotel, almost daily,\r\nbut I never remember having seen a Todar engaged in any occupation\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nThe women become the wives of all the brothers into whose families\r\nthey marry, the children being apportioned to husbands according to\r\nseniority. This pernicious custom is also common among the Coorg, and\r\nthe Tiars of Malabar. The Todars, formerly, only allowed one female\r\nchild to live in each family, the rest being strangled; but the\r\nauthorities have lately interfered to put a stop to this custom. When\r\na Todar bride is given away, she is brought to the dwelling of her\r\nhusbands, who each put their feet upon her head; she is then sent to\r\nfetch water for cooking, and the ceremony is considered to be complete.\r\n\r\nThe German missionaries, who have had a good deal of intercourse with\r\nthese people, say that they worship the \"sacred buffalo bell,\" as\r\na representation of _Hiridea_, or the chief God, before which they\r\npour libations of milk; and when there is a dispute about wives or\r\nbuffaloes it is decided by the priest, who becomes possessed by the\r\n_Bell God_, rushes frantically about, and pronounces in favour of the\r\nrichest. Formerly there were seven holy _munds_, each inhabited by\r\na recluse called _palaul_ (milkman), attended upon by a _kavilaul_\r\n(herdsman); but three of these are now deserted, and the fourth is\r\nrarely frequented. The rest have a herd of holy buffaloes attached to\r\nthem for the use of the sanctified occupants, and no women may approach\r\nthem. The only religious festival of any kind celebrated by the Todars,\r\nand that scarcely deserves the name, takes place on the occasion of a\r\nfuneral, when there is much dancing and music. The body is burnt, and\r\nbuffaloes are slaughtered to go with the spirit, and supply it with\r\nmilk. This is called the green funeral. A year afterwards there is\r\nanother ceremony called the dry funeral, when forty or fifty buffaloes\r\nwere hunted down, and beaten to death with clubs; but the Government\r\nhas recently prohibited the immolation of more than two beasts for a\r\nrich, and one for a poor Todar. The burial-places are like gigantic\r\nextinguishers, twelve feet high, and thatched with grass. The bodies\r\nare burnt, and the ashes collected and put into chatties, which are\r\ndeposited in the extinguisher. The Todars have no other ceremonies,\r\ncare for nothing but their buffaloes, and leave prayers to the _palaul_\r\nin his lonely retreat, or to the _palikarpal_ or dairyman of each mund,\r\nwho covers his nose with his thumb when he enters the sacred dairy, and\r\nsays \"May all be well!\"[404]\r\n\r\nThe Todar language is a very rude dialect of the old Canarese, and\r\nsimilar to that of the Badagas, another hill tribe. It is very poor in\r\nwords conveying abstract ideas, as they have few notions beyond their\r\nbuffaloes; their verbs have generally but one tense, and they express\r\nthe future and past by means of adverbs of time.[405]\r\n\r\nThere are many ancient cairns and _tumuli_ on the peaks of the\r\nNeilgherries, and it has been objected that they cannot be assigned\r\nto the ancestors of the Todars, because agricultural implements have\r\nbeen found in them, and these people never cultivate the ground. But\r\nit must be remembered that the Todars now extort _goodoo_ or tribute\r\nof grain from the other hill tribes, and that it is their only food.\r\nIt must be inferred, therefore, that, before they discovered this easy\r\nmode of procuring food, and previous to the arrival of these weaker\r\nagricultural tribes on the hills, the Todars must have been their own\r\ncultivators. The hill people attribute all ancient ruins, of the origin\r\nof which they know nothing, to the Pandus, the famous heroes of Hindu\r\ntradition; and all that can be said of these Neilgherry cairns is that\r\nthey are probably the work of an unknown extinct race, who practised\r\nDruidical rites.[406]\r\n\r\nWe visited several of these remains of an ancient people. On the summit\r\nof the peak of Kalhutty, on the left hand of the road leading down the\r\nSeegoor ghaut to the Mysore plains, whence there is a grand view of\r\nmountain scenery, forest-clad slopes, and a wide expanse of country\r\nstretching away to the horizon, we found several old cairns. They were\r\nof great size, built of immense stones, and hollow in the centre. On\r\nanother peak, called Ibex Hill, one side of which is a scarped cliff\r\nmany hundreds of feet in height, overhanging the Seegoor ghaut, we also\r\nfound two huge cairns, forming a circle about eight feet in diameter.\r\nThere are many others in different parts of the hills, generally on\r\nthe highest peaks, and iron spear-heads, bells, sepulchral urns with\r\nfigures of coiled snakes, tigers, elephants, dogs, and birds on them,\r\nsickles and gold rings have been found buried under the piles of stones.\r\n\r\nThe Todars, as has been said, are the \"lords of the hills,\" and not\r\nonly all the other hill tribes pay them tribute, but the English\r\nGovernment also pays rent to them for the land on which the stations\r\nare situated.[407] But the agricultural tribe of Burghers or Badagas,\r\nwho came to the hills several centuries after the Todars, and are\r\nsubject to them, are by far the most numerous, numbering 15,000 souls,\r\nand occupying 300 villages. They are divided into eighteen classes or\r\ncastes, the members of one of which, called the Wodearu Badagas, wear\r\nthe Brahminical string, are proud and lazy, and inhabit five villages\r\napart from the rest. The villages of the Badagas are scattered all\r\nover the plateau of the hills, and their land occupies two-thirds\r\nof its area. They are much darker, and not nearly such fine men as\r\nthe Todars, wear cotton-cloth turbans and clothing much like other\r\nnatives of India, and are very superstitious and timid; but they are\r\nindustrious, though not so much so as the labourers who come up from\r\nthe plains, and kind and affectionate to their women and children.\r\nThe Badagas, though they possess herds of buffaloes, are chiefly\r\nemployed in cultivation. Their crops consist of _raggee_ (_Eleusine\r\ncorocana_), the most prolific of cultivated grasses,[408] which is\r\nmade into dark brown cakes and porridge; _samee_ or Italian millet,\r\nbarley, an amaranth called _keeray_, some pulses, mustard, onions, and\r\npotatoes. We often passed through the Badaga villages. The houses are\r\nbuilt in a single row, with one thatched roof extending over so as\r\nto form a verandah, supported on poles. In front there is a hard mud\r\nfloor, where the piles of grain are heaped up; and there is generally\r\na _Swami_-house or temple, with a verandah in front supported by\r\nnumerous poles, the walls and poles being painted in red and white\r\nstripes, the Hindu holy colour. Round the villages there are cultivated\r\npatches of _raggee_ and _samee_, which they were reaping in December.\r\nIn the centre of the fields there is a small threshing-floor, where\r\nwe often saw the Badagas sifting the grain from the chaff by shaking\r\nit through sieves, and letting the wind blow the chaff away. A Todar\r\nwas generally squatting near, like an old vulture, waiting for his\r\n_goodoo_. The Badagas belong to the Siva sect, their principal deity\r\nbeing Rungaswamy, whose temple is on the summit of the easternmost peak\r\nof the Neilgherries; but they also worship 338 other idols or _Swamis_,\r\nsuch as trees, streams, stone pillars, and even old knives.\r\n\r\nAnother hill tribe is that of the Koters, who occupy seven large\r\nvillages called _Kotergherry_ (cowkiller's hill). They are of very\r\nlow caste, and work as carpenters, smiths, rope-makers, and potters,\r\nbesides cultivating the ground. The Koters also dress and prepare\r\nbuffalo-hides, and they are a squalid dirty race, living on the carrion\r\nthey pick up on the road-sides. They number about five hundred souls,\r\nand are the artizans of the hills, repairing the ploughs, hoes, and\r\nbill-hooks for the Badagas.\r\n\r\nThe Kurumbers, another tribe, live on the slopes of the hills, in the\r\nmost feverish places. They are a short miserable-looking race, and\r\nthose called _Mooloo_ or jungle Kurumbers are regular wild men of the\r\nwoods, in no respect raised above the beasts of the forest. The others\r\nact as musicians and sorcerers to the Todars and Badagas.\r\n\r\nLastly, the Irulas live low down the slopes of the hills, perform the\r\noffice of priests in the Badagas' temple on the Rungaswamy peak, and\r\noccasionally act plays from the life of Krishna at Badaga festivals.\r\n\r\nThese five tribes of Todars, Badagas, Koters, Kurumbers, and Irulas,\r\nappear for centuries to have had the exclusive enjoyment of the\r\nNeilgherry hills; though Tippoo Sultan of Mysore erected a fort\r\nat Kalhutty, half-way up the Seegoor ghaut, and another on the\r\nHoolicul-droog, overhanging the Coonoor ghaut, which leads up from the\r\nCoimbatore plains. He is said to have used these strongholds for the\r\ndetention of prisoners, and to enable his officers to extort tribute\r\nfrom the hill tribes. The Neilgherry hills were first discovered by two\r\nEnglish civilians who made their way up to the plateau in chasing some\r\nMoplah smugglers.[409]\r\n\r\nIn 1820 Mr. John Sullivan, then Collector of Coimbatore, built the\r\nfirst house in Ootacamund, on the site of a Todar mund of the same\r\nname.[410] It is now used as the building for the Lawrence Asylum.\r\nThe first sanatarium on the hills, however, was at Dimhutty, on the\r\neastern side, and at the adjoining station of Kotergherry, but the\r\nformer is now abandoned. The delightful climate soon attracted crowds\r\nof visitors from the burning plains; many houses gradually rose up\r\non the grassy slopes round the lake which was formed at Ootacamund\r\nby bunding up one end of the valley, and the place rapidly became an\r\nimportant hill-station. A small native town and bazaar sprang up on\r\nthe banks of the lake, a handsome church was erected, a club-house,\r\nand, most conspicuous of all, an immense Parsee shop kept by Framjee\r\nNusserwanjee of Bombay. The roads are excellent, and planted with tall\r\ngraceful Acacia and gum-trees from Australia, and many of the houses\r\nare surrounded by beautiful gardens and shrubberies. The most charming,\r\nperhaps, is that of the late Bishop Dealtry, called Bishops-down,\r\nwhence there is a glorious view of the station on one side, and of the\r\ndistant Koondah hills, overtopped by the sharp peak of Makoorty, on\r\nthe other. Advantage has here been taken of a wooded _shola_ to make\r\npleasant shady walks, and cut vistas through the trees.\r\n\r\nThe warmer station of Coonoor is about nine miles from Ootacamund, at\r\nthe head of the ghaut which leads down to the plains of Coimbatore.\r\nHere the scenery is far more beautiful than at the central station,\r\nas the wooded sides of the ghaut run up into a fine peak called the\r\nHoolicul-droog, and the view extends far away over the plains. The\r\nhouses are perched on the rounded tops of a range of hills, and there\r\nis a church with a fine tower, which is a great addition to the view\r\nof Coonoor from the surrounding eminences. A mile from Coonoor, in\r\nthe direction of Ootacamund, is the military station of Jakatalla,\r\nthe finest barracks I ever saw in any part of the world. It is well\r\nsheltered by high hills from the cold north winds to which Ootacamund\r\nis exposed, as well as from the south-west monsoon, and is in every\r\nrespect admirably adapted as a sanatarium for soldiers and their\r\nfamilies. It has been maintained that the children of Europeans cannot\r\nbe reared even on the hills of India, though upon what grounds this\r\nextraordinary assertion is based I have not yet learnt. The strongest\r\narguments against this idea are the fresh rosy cheeks and rude health\r\nof the boys and girls in the Lawrence asylum, and of the boys and\r\nyoung men at Mr. Pope's[411] and Mr. Nash's schools in Ootacamund,\r\nwho present a striking contrast to the children on the plains. The\r\nbracing climate of the upper plateau of these hills appears to me\r\nto be perfectly well adapted for European colonists: it has all the\r\nadvantages with none of the disadvantages of England, and there are\r\nno influences which can be detrimental to English constitutions. At\r\nthe time of our visit a battalion of the 60th Rifles, and a number\r\nof convalescent soldiers from other regiments, were stationed at\r\nJakatalla. The quarters for the men are built round a large quadrangle,\r\nwith an upper story, and airy corridors for exercise in wet weather.\r\nBeyond are the married quarters for ninety couples, each with two\r\ncomfortable rooms and a little garden; and there are also a hospital,\r\nlibrary, schoolrooms, substantially-built skittle-alley with brick\r\narches, fives-court, and swimming-bath. The officers are quartered\r\nin bungalows on the surrounding hill-slopes, or at Coonoor. It would\r\nbe well if the whole of the European troops in the Madras Presidency\r\nwere permanently quartered on the Neilgherry and other hills as soon\r\nas the railroads are completed. Many of the married men might be\r\npermitted to cultivate and settle on land of their own, with their\r\nfamilies, subject to the condition of being liable to be called on to\r\nserve if required, and a sort of military colony might thus be formed.\r\nThere is excellent pasture for flocks of sheep, wheat may be grown in\r\nany quantity, and there is not the slightest danger to Europeans in\r\nundertaking field labour.\r\n\r\nThe English settler on the Neilgherries will find English fruits,\r\nflowers, vegetables, and grasses, the introduction of which is mainly\r\ndue to the exertions of Mr. William G. McIvor, the Superintendent of\r\nthe Government gardens at Ootacamund, and now also Superintendent\r\nof Chinchona plantations in Southern India. This gentleman has been\r\nin charge of the gardens at Ootacamund since 1848, and unites zeal,\r\nintelligence, and skill to the talent and experience of an excellent\r\npractical gardener. Under his auspices the steep slopes of one of\r\nthe spurs, which run off from the peak of Dodabetta, and overlook\r\nthe cantonment of Ootacamund, have been converted into a tastefully\r\nlaid-out garden, in a succession of terraces. Hampered at first by the\r\ninterference of a useless committee, and with no assistance beyond that\r\nof an East Indian foreman and labourers from the Mysore plains, he has\r\nsucceeded in changing the wild mountain-sides into a very beautiful\r\npublic garden. Every point of view is taken advantage of with admirable\r\ntaste, and numerous trees and flowering shrubs have been introduced\r\nfrom England, Australia, and other countries, while the native flora of\r\nthe hills is fully represented. There are English roses and geraniums,\r\nponds bordered by white arums, shady walks over-arched by trellis-work,\r\ntasteful vases filled with showy flowers, thickets of rhododendrons,\r\nhedges of heliotrope and fuchsia, fine clumps of tall spreading trees,\r\nand, from the upper terraces, between the leafy branches, there are\r\nglorious views of the Ootacamund valley, and of the finely broken range\r\nof the distant Koondah hills.\r\n\r\nMr. McIvor also has a small branch-garden at Kalhutty, about half-way\r\ndown the Seegoor ghaut, leading to the Mysore plains, for raising\r\nfruits which require a warmer climate. This garden is self-supporting.\r\nA magnificent waterfall descends into a rocky basin close beside it,\r\nand the garden contains oranges of many kinds, shaddocks, lemons,\r\nlimes, citrons, nutmegs, loquats, and plantains. On this spot the\r\ndelicious chirimoyas, the seeds of which we brought from Peru,\r\nwill hereafter ripen, and enable the people of India to taste the\r\n\"masterpiece of nature.\"\r\n\r\nEuropean enterprise on the Neilgherries has hitherto been chiefly\r\ndirected towards the cultivation of coffee, and there are several\r\nfine estates near Coonoor. On the 15th of November we set out from\r\nOotacamund to visit them, and rode down the valley of Kaitee, where the\r\nhouse stands which once belonged to Lord Elphinstone, certainly not in\r\na well-selected spot. It was originally chosen for a Government farm,\r\nwhich was given up, and the house was then occupied for a short time by\r\nthe Governor of Pondicherry. Lord Elphinstone, when Governor of Madras,\r\ntook a fancy to the place, erected a very substantial house, finished\r\nit handsomely, and frequently resided there. In 1845 the property\r\nwas bought by Mr. Casamajor of the Civil Service, who established a\r\nschool there for Badaga children, on the principle of paying them for\r\ncoming, at the rate of 1 anna a day. On his death he left it to the\r\nBasle Evangelical Missionaries, by whom it is now occupied. They have\r\nschools, and labour amongst the Badagas, but as yet with scarcely any\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nThe stream which drains the Kaitee valley forms a very beautiful\r\nwaterfall down the face of a cliff into the Karteri valley, where there\r\nis a small coffee estate worked by a Frenchman; and, after crossing\r\na range of hills, in parts thickly wooded, and in parts covered\r\nwith a shrubby _Justitia_ with a blue flower, we reached the coffee\r\nplantation of Hoolicul,[412] owned by Mr. Stainbank. The highest\r\npart of his estate is 5700 feet above the sea,[413] and here he has\r\ntwenty-five acres planted in rather poor soil. Below his house there\r\nare about forty-five more acres planted, down the steep slopes of the\r\nhill, some of the bushes in very good bearing. They are thick, as he\r\nis against pruning the branches, saying that when covered by leafy\r\nbranches the fruit ripens by degrees, and consequently requires less\r\nlabour in picking. The estate has passed through several hands, and the\r\noldest trees were planted seventeen years ago. Mr. Stainbank expects\r\neventually to get fifty tons of coffee off this estate, in the year. An\r\nacre will occasionally yield twenty-five hundredweight.\r\n\r\nThe view from the house is very fine. The plantation slopes away by a\r\nvery steep descent, and in the distance are the Lambton's Peak range of\r\nmountains, and the wide plains of Coimbatore.\r\n\r\nLeaving Hoolicul, we again descended into the ravine of Karteri, where\r\nthe river passes close under the steep face of the hills on which the\r\nstation of Coonoor stands, and on the slopes of the opposite mountains\r\nthere are several coffee estates. Mr. Dawson, a son of the landlord of\r\nthe hotel at Ootacamund, has 100 acres planted; but the most extensive\r\nestate, on the steep slopes overlooking the ghaut leading down into\r\nthe Coimbatore plains, belongs to Mr. Stanes. He has 200 acres planted\r\nwith 250,000 trees, up the precipitous sides of the mountain, facing\r\neast, and protected from the excessive rains of the S.W. monsoon. The\r\nelevation above the sea is upwards of 4800 feet. On the summits of the\r\nmountains above this estate Mr. Stanes has induced the Todars to form\r\ntwo cattle crawls, whence manure is washed down to his plantation. The\r\ntrees are planted in rows, 6 to 8 feet apart, and regularly topped and\r\npruned, so as to admit the sun to ripen the fruit on every branch.\r\nThey are from 4 to 6 feet high, and planted in holes 20 inches deep\r\nby 18; the young plants being brought from a nursery, where seedlings\r\nare raised. The trees are generally in full bearing in the third year.\r\nAfter the berries are picked, and brought in baskets to the _godown_\r\nor warehouse, the pulp or fleshy part has to be removed. The berries\r\nare placed in heaps in a loft, above the _pulper_, looking bright and\r\nred like ripe cherries. They are then sent down a shoot, into which\r\na stream of water is conducted, and are thus washed into the pulper.\r\nOn Mr. Stanes's estate this machine is worked by a water-wheel, but\r\ngenerally it is turned by hand and a fly-wheel. The pulper is a roller\r\ncovered with a sheet of copper, made rough like a nutmeg-grater. The\r\nberries fall on it as it goes round, but there is only room for the\r\nseed to pass, so that the pulp is squeezed off, and carried away by\r\na stream thrown off by the water-wheel, while the naked coffee drops\r\non the other side. The seeds are still covered with glutinous matter,\r\nto remove which they are well washed in a cistern, the inferior ones\r\nfloating, while the good ones sink. The coffee-seeds are then laid out\r\non the _barbecus_, square platforms of brick plastered with _chunam_,\r\nwith sides a foot high; where they dry in the sun for about three days,\r\nand are afterwards stored in the godowns.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that an acre of jungle on the Neilgherries may be\r\ncleared for 200 Rs., including all expenses. The coffee-seedlings, from\r\nthe nursery, may be planted out in seven months, and they will yield a\r\nfirst crop in three years. Coffee-seeds are 5 Rs. a bushel, and that\r\nquantity will rear 10,000 plants, covering 10 acres. One acre ought to\r\nyield one ton, when well cultivated, selling at Calicut, uncleaned,\r\nfor 4 annas the pound. In three years the estate ought to pay 10 per\r\ncent. on the capital expended, if well conducted; the next year the\r\ngross profit should increase to 60 per cent., and afterwards to 100\r\nper cent. A good dwelling-house will cost 4000 Rs.; the pulping-house,\r\nmachinery, and godowns, 4000 Rs. more. Carpenters get 20 Rs. a month,\r\nbricklayers 15 Rs., with 2 annas a day batta for coming out of the\r\ntown, and common labourers 4-1/2 Rs.\r\n\r\nThe Neilgherry planters have great advantages in the way of means of\r\nconveyance from their estates to Calicut and Beypoor, their ports of\r\nshipment. The coffee is carried down the Coonoor ghaut on pack-bullocks\r\nto Matepoliem, and thence in carts along a good road, by Palghatchery,\r\nto the sea-coast. Generally the coffee from the Neilgherry estates\r\nis bought by Mr. Perry and Mr. Andrews at Calicut, in rather a dirty\r\nstate. They have garbling-machines for clearing away all remaining dry\r\npulp, and removing the outer coat from the seeds; and they make their\r\nprofit by shipping the coffee and selling it in a clean state fit for\r\nEuropean use. Neilgherry coffee has an excellent name in the London\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nEuropeans, on the Neilgherries, hold land by a _puttum_ or grant from\r\nGovernment, leasing it in perpetuity, so long as the assessment is\r\npaid, which is fixed at 1 R. per acre of coffee-land, levied after\r\nthe third year. By the resolution of the Madras Government, dated\r\nAugust 5th, 1859, the terms on which waste lands can be purchased were\r\nregulated. These orders apply to all the regions in Southern India\r\nwhich are suited for coffee or chinchona cultivation. It was resolved\r\nto sell outright the fee-simple of all land used for building, and of\r\nwaste land in the hills, without reservation of quit-rent, and with an\r\nabsolute and indefeasible title, sold to the highest bidder at an upset\r\nprice, at twenty times the amount of yearly quit-rent or land-tax. A\r\ntitle-deed will be given under the seal of the Government, declaring\r\nthe absolute title of the holder, free from all demands on account of\r\nland-revenue, with full powers to dispose of the land at pleasure, but\r\nnot exempting it from payments for municipal purposes. Other parties,\r\nhowever, claiming a previous right in the land, will be free to sue\r\nthe holder in the Civil Courts, up to a certain time, so that it will\r\nbe necessary to make careful investigations on this point before\r\npurchasing. When the land-tax is not redeemed, Government will issue\r\npermanent title-deeds, reserving a quit-rent, and the holder will be\r\nfree to redeem the tax, on the same terms, at any future time.\r\n\r\nWith regard to labour on the Neilgherries, there used to be abundant\r\nsupplies of coolies from Mysore and Coimbatore, but they have recently\r\nfallen off, owing to competition on the railway works. Mr. Stanes was\r\npaying his labourers 4-1/2 Rs. a month, and women 3-1/2 Rs. He told me\r\nthat he was particular always to pay every labourer himself, and to\r\nbe very kind to them, by which means he never found any difficulty in\r\nprocuring labour. Some of the planters get the services of Badagas, and\r\neven of some Kurumbers in the picking-time, but the hill tribes are not\r\ngenerally willing to work on the coffee plantations. There are fifteen\r\ncoffee estates on the Neilgherry hills.\r\n\r\nBut the oldest coffee-district in Southern India is Wynaad, a\r\nforest-covered plateau about 3000 feet above the sea, which adjoins the\r\nNeilgherries on the north. In this district there are upwards of thirty\r\ncoffee-plantations, some of them, such as that of Messrs. Campbell\r\nand Ouchterlony, near the ascent to the Neilgherry hills, being very\r\nextensive.[414] There is a great rainfall in Wynaad during the S.W.\r\nmonsoon, and the crops are very abundant; but at the same time the\r\ncoffee is not so good as that grown in drier situations, such as the\r\nNeilgherries near Coonoor, though the yield is greater. Most of the\r\navailable land is already taken up. The labour is derived from Mysore,\r\nwhence the coolies come, often from distances of sixty or seventy\r\nmiles, returning to their families when their wages are paid. In 1860\r\nthe tax on coffee-estates in Wynaad was fixed at 2 Rs. an acre on land\r\nactually planted, to be imposed in the third year, at which time the\r\ntrees are in bearing.[415]\r\n\r\nThe export trade in coffee, from all the hill-districts of Southern\r\nIndia, was, in 1859-60, as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                    Quantity.

For the superintendence of these important measures,\r\ntogether with other duties, Dr. Cleghorn has been placed at the head of\r\na Forest Conservancy Department in the Madras Presidency. He strongly\r\nurges that the high wooded mountain-tops overhanging the low country\r\nshould not be allowed to be cleared for coffee-cultivation, lest the\r\nsupplies of water should be injured.[416] \"The courses of rivulets,\"\r\nhe says, \"should be overshadowed with trees, and the hills should\r\ntherefore be left clothed for a distance of half their height from\r\nthe top, leaving half the slopes and all the valleys for cultivation.\r\nImmense tracts of virgin forest in the valleys of the Koondah hills\r\nare eminently suited for coffee-cultivation. The clearing should only\r\nbe allowed from 2500 to 4500 feet, this being the extreme range within\r\nwhich coffee planted on a large scale is found to thrive.\"\r\n\r\nThere are still thousands of acres of uncleared forests, at suitable\r\nelevations, well adapted for the growth of coffee, in the cultivation\r\nof which the English capitalist would make large and rapid profits; yet\r\nit is not many years since the first coffee-plants were introduced into\r\nthese hills. Coffee now forms an important item in the exports from the\r\nMadras Presidency. There is every reason to hope that the bark from\r\nquinine-yielding chinchona-trees may also become one of the valuable\r\nproducts of the hills; and in the following chapter I propose to give\r\nan account of the selection of the sites for the first experimental\r\nplantations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nSELECTION OF SITES FOR CHINCHONA-PLANTATIONS ON THE NEILGHERRY HILLS.\r\n\r\nThe Dodabetta site--The Neddiwuttum site.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN selecting sites for chinchona plantations in the Neilgherry hills\r\nwe had to compare the climate and other conditions of growth which\r\nprevail in the chinchona forests and open _pajonales_ in the Andes\r\nwith any similar localities which might be found in Southern India.\r\nFor the first experimental sites, it was of course important that the\r\nresemblance, as regards elevation, temperature, and humidity, should be\r\nas close as possible; but there was every reason to hope that, under\r\ncultivation, these plants, like most others, would adapt themselves to\r\nconditions of soil and climate extending over a far more extensive area.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to fix upon two sites in the first instance, one at\r\nthe highest point at which chinchona-plants were likely to flourish,\r\nfor the species from Loxa and others growing at great elevations,\r\nand as an experimental plantation; and another in a lower and warmer\r\nposition for the plants of _C. succirubra_, _C. Peruviana_, _C.\r\nmicrantha_, and the tree _C. Calisaya_. The highest point at which\r\nthese plants will flourish, and the greatest exposure they will bear\r\nwithout injury, are the most favourable conditions for the formation of\r\nquinine; while, if the _sholas_ in the upper plateau of the Neilgherry\r\nhills should prove to be adapted for their growth, their cultivation\r\nmight be indefinitely extended in a climate suitable for English\r\nsettlers.\r\n\r\nPrevious to my arrival on the hills Mr. McIvor had selected a site for\r\nthe highest plantation in a wooded ravine or _shola_ at the back of the\r\nhills which rise above the Government gardens; and, after a careful\r\nexamination, I came to the conclusion that it was well suited for the\r\ngrowth of the hardier species, and for the experimental culture of all\r\nthe kinds which have been introduced into India. It has been named the\r\n\"Dodabetta\" site, from the peak, the highest point of the Neilgherries,\r\nand 8640 feet above the sea, which rises up immediately behind it.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the species for which I considered the Dodabetta site\r\nto be suitable, it will be well in this place to recapitulate the\r\ncircumstances under which they grow on their native mountains.\r\n\r\nThe shrub variety of _C. Calisaya_ (lat. 13° to 15° S.) flourishes\r\nin open _pajonales_, quite exposed, at elevations from 5000 to 7000\r\nfeet above the sea, and in April and May I found the mean temperature\r\nto be 60-1/3°, minimum 55°, and range 17°. The _C. nitida_ (lat. 10°\r\nS.) grows at similar elevations, but we have no exact information\r\nrespecting the temperature and humidity. The varieties of _C.\r\nCondaminea_ (lat. 4° S.) flourish at heights from 6000 to 8000 feet\r\nabove the sea, where the mean range is from 45° to 60°, in a moist\r\nclimate, and in exposed but always dry situations; and one kind,\r\nthe _C. crispa_, the seeds of which have been received in India and\r\nCeylon, grows in a deposit of peat, 8000 feet above the sea, in a\r\ntemperature falling as low as 27°.[417] The _C. lancifolia_ (lat. 5°\r\nN.) is found at 7000 feet above the sea and upwards, where the annual\r\nrange is from freezing-point to 75°, in an exceedingly moist climate.\r\nThe rainy season lasts for nine months, when the constant rain is\r\nonly interrupted in the day by interchanging sun-rays and fog-clouds.\r\nIn the dry season cold clear nights follow days in which a warm sun\r\npenetrates through the fog, which almost constantly lies on the damp\r\nfoliage of the forest.[418] Mr. Cross mentions that he saw trees of _C.\r\nsuccirubra_ on his way to Loxa, growing at elevations of from 8000 to\r\n9000 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nThe site, in the Dodabetta ravine, slopes down from 7700 to 7600 feet\r\nabove the sea, yet, from local causes, it is several degrees warmer\r\nthan the station at Ootacamund; and the temperature agrees with that of\r\nthe species of chinchona-plants described above. The annual temperature\r\nof the peak of Dodabetta, of Ootacamund, and of the warmer station of\r\nKotergherry, are given on the following page.\r\n\r\nThe Dodabetta site, being four or five degrees warmer than Ootacamund,\r\nthroughout the year, has a temperature, on the whole, somewhat warmer\r\nthan the lofty regions where the species of chinchona grow, for\r\nthe cultivation of which this position was selected. The elevation\r\nabove the sea exactly corresponds, and the amount of humidity is\r\nabout the same. The ravine is full of fine trees, with a variety of\r\nexposures, the general aspect being north-west; a clear little stream\r\nflows through it; and, in most parts, the soil consists of a rich\r\nloam four or five feet deep. Outside the wooded ravine there are\r\ntree Rhododendrons, Berberis, Gaultherias, lilies, Lycopodia, and\r\nbrake-ferns, scattered about on the grassy slopes; and the character of\r\nthe scenery and vegetation very closely resembles that of the _pajonal_\r\ncountry between the valleys of Sandia and Tambopata in Caravaya, where\r\nthe shrub _Calisaya_ flourishes. The site is protected by rising\r\ngrounds from the cold northerly winds, and the colder breezes blowing\r\nover it from ridge to ridge prevent the warm air in the ravine from\r\nrising, so that the temperature became warmer as we ascended through\r\nthe wood, and in the highest part there were orchids and pepper-vines\r\nhanging on the trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Observations by T. G. TAYLOR, and by Capt. OUCHTERLONY.]\r\n\r\nThe analogy between the flora of the Dodabetta ravine and of the\r\nloftier parts of the chinchona region was another point which\r\ninfluenced my decision. Within the ravine there are nine species of\r\nchinchonaceous plants, namely--\r\n\r\n  _Hedyotis Lawsoniæ._\r\n  _Hedyotis stylosa._\r\n  _Lasianthus venulosus._\r\n  _Coffea alpestris._\r\n  _Coffea grumelioides._\r\n  _Canthium umbellatum._\r\n  _Grumilea elongata._\r\n  _Grumilea congesta._\r\n  _Psychotria bisulcata._\r\n\r\nThese are mostly ornamental pretty shrubs, from six to eight feet\r\nhigh, with clusters of white or cream-coloured flowers. The other\r\ngenera of which the wood is composed are as follows:--_Vaccinium_,\r\n_Myrsine_, _Symplocos_, _Ilex_, _Michelia_, _Sapota_, _Isonandra_,\r\nand _Cinnamon_ among the trees; _Eugenia_, _Myrtus_, _Jasminum_,\r\n_Osbeckia_, _Sonerila_, _Solanum_, _Viburnum_, and _Acanthus_ among\r\nshrubs; _Lonicera_, _Passiflora_, _Rubia_, and _pepper-vines_ among the\r\nclimbers; with an undergrowth of _Lobelia_, _Begonia_, _Convolvulus_,\r\norchids, and ferns. The _Osbeckias_ and _Sonerilas_ represent the\r\nmelastomaceous plants, the constant companions of chinchonæ in South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nIt was no small advantage that this excellent site for a chinchona\r\nplantation was close to the Government gardens, and that it would thus\r\nbe under the constant supervision of Mr. McIvor. It receives a supply\r\nof moisture during both monsoons, and is, therefore, as good a position\r\nas could have been selected on the higher plateau of the Neilgherries,\r\nthough there are many _sholas_ which will be found equally well adapted\r\nfor the growth of the hardier chinchonas. These precious plants will,\r\nit is to be hoped, before very long, form large plantations on all\r\nparts of the hills, and become one of the most important products\r\nof the Neilgherries. In the mean while Mr. McIvor, the Government\r\nSuperintendent, using the Dodabetta site as an experimental plantation,\r\nwill be enabled to demonstrate the successful results of chinchona\r\nculture, and to raise thousands of plants for the supply of private\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nThe most extensive operations must, however, necessarily be carried\r\non at much lower elevations, where the _C. succirubra_, the species\r\nrichest in febrifugal alkaloids, will flourish best, and where vast\r\nunoccupied forests afford space for plantations on a large scale. A\r\nnorthern aspect is the one best adapted for the vigorous growth of\r\ntrees on the Neilgherry hills, and we, therefore, proceeded to examine\r\nthe forest-covered slopes overlooking the table-lands of Wynaad and\r\nMysore, for a site for the lower chinchona plantation. We started from\r\nOotacamund early one November morning, and rode across the central\r\nplateau of the hills, consisting of rounded grassy undulations,\r\nintersected by wooded _sholas_. In some of the hollows the streams\r\nhad formed large swamps, where there were extensive deposits of peat.\r\nThe traveller's bungalow of Pycarrah, the first on the road towards\r\nWynaad, is ten miles from Ootacamund, on the banks of a river of the\r\nsame name. Several huge boulders of syenite obstruct the stream and\r\ncause it to foam noisily round them, and the wet stones were covered\r\nwith _Podostemads_, herbaceous branched floating plants, with the habit\r\nof liverworts. We saw several otters playing in the water, and peering\r\nat us from behind the rocks. Six miles beyond Pycarrah is the bungalow\r\nof Neddiwuttum, on the edge of the rapid descent into Wynaad, and the\r\nroad descends from the upland slopes through a jungle where the ferns\r\nfirst appear, and maiden-hair, ceterach, and other ferns grow by the\r\nroadside. Some garden marigolds from England had been planted near the\r\nNeddiwuttum bungalow, and they had spread themselves in masses over the\r\nadjacent slopes.\r\n\r\nThe tract of forest land which we came to examine is close to the\r\nbungalow, and from the grassy hill above it there is a glorious view of\r\nWynaad, and of the plains of Mysore, stretching away to the horizon.\r\nHere the mountains sink abruptly down to the Wynaad table-land, and\r\nthe Moyaar river thunders down in a long waterfall, divides Wynaad\r\nfrom Mysore, and, flowing through a deep gorge to join the Bowany in\r\nCoimbatore, eventually swells the waters of the great river Cauvery.\r\nThe land available for immediate occupation comprises about 400 acres\r\nof uncleared forest on the mountain slopes, at an elevation from\r\na little over 6000 to a little under 5000 feet above the level of\r\nthe sea, and with a mean temperature about 8° warmer than that of\r\nOotacamund.\r\n\r\nI selected this site for a plantation of _C. succirubra_, _C.\r\nCalisaya_, _C. micrantha_, and the very delicate _C. Peruviana_,\r\nbecause, with a good supply of water, and a deep rich soil on a base of\r\ndecomposing laterite and syenite, it had a suitable elevation above the\r\nsea, temperature, and amount of humidity. The information we possess\r\non these points, with regard to the above species, is by no means\r\ncomplete; but it is sufficiently exact to enable us to form a correct\r\nopinion. Mr. Spruce gives the following details respecting the climate\r\nof the region of _C. succirubra_, in latitude 1° 40´ S. The zone of the\r\n\"red bark\" is from 2450 to 5000 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\n                                                               Range in\r\n      Mean Min. Mean Max.

In\r\nthe wet season the early part of the day is foggy, and there is heavy\r\ncontinuous rain during the afternoons and nights. In the region of _C.\r\nCalisaya_, from 13° to 16° S. lat., and from 4000 to 6000 feet above\r\nthe sea, the dry season lasts from April to the end of August. April\r\nand August are showery months. May is also showery, but clear in the\r\nforenoons, and the mean temperature during the first half is 69°, mean\r\nmaximum 71-1/2°, and mean minimum 62-1/2°. June and July are hot dry\r\nmonths, with little rain, a bright hot sun in the day, but cold clear\r\nnights. In September the rains begin, increase in October, and pour\r\ndown incessantly from the beginning of November to the middle of March,\r\nwith very hot, damp days and nights. We have no detailed information\r\nrespecting the region of _C. micrantha_ and _C. Peruviana_, species\r\nwhich flourish in 10° S. lat., from 4000 to 5500 feet above the sea.\r\nFrom May to November the sun shines powerfully, yet heavy rains fell\r\nfrom day to day in June and July 1860, and it was not until August\r\nthat the days were clear and bright. At Casapi, in this region, where\r\na register was kept, it rained during half the days in the year.[419]\r\nFrom November to May is the rainy season, and sometimes the rain pours\r\ndown for six or seven days without intermission.[420]\r\n\r\nThe Neddiwuttum site, being about 8° or 10° warmer than Ootacamund,\r\nhas a temperature exactly similar to that of the forests where the\r\nabove species of chinchonæ flourish. Its elevation above the sea is\r\nalso the same as that of the chinchona forests. It is true that Mr.\r\nSpruce gives the extreme upper limit of the \"red-bark\" region at 5000\r\nfeet; but Mr. Cross saw that species growing at an elevation of 8000\r\nfeet; and the great importance of cultivating this species at the\r\nhighest possible elevation is demonstrated by Mr. Spruce's observation\r\nthat the bark of trees growing low down and near the plains is by no\r\nmeans so thick as that of trees which flourish in a loftier and more\r\ntemperate climate.[421] The Neddiwuttum site is within the limit of the\r\nregion which receives both monsoons. Though protected to some extent\r\nfrom the south-west, it receives a full share of the rains during the\r\nsummer, and is also supplied with moisture by the north-east monsoon,\r\ncoming across Mysore between October and December. During the remaining\r\nmonths it is visited by mists and heavy dews in the nights until\r\nthe south-west monsoon again commences in May. It will probably be\r\nfound that these species of chinchonæ will bear a much drier climate\r\nthan we at present suppose; and I have no misgivings that the amount\r\nof humidity at Neddiwuttum will not be amply sufficient for their\r\nsuccessful cultivation. The only person who has visited this site since\r\nits selection, who is capable, through personal knowledge of the South\r\nAmerican chinchona forests, of forming an opinion, is Mr. Cross. It is\r\nexceedingly satisfactory to find that he not only approves of it for\r\nthe cultivation of plants of the \"red-bark\" species, but that, from the\r\nsuperior depth and richness of the soil, he considers that they are\r\nlikely to thrive even better than in their native forests near Limon,\r\non the eastern slopes of Chimborazo.\r\n\r\nIn the Neddiwuttum forest, among other plants, I found the\r\n_Hymenodictyon excelsum_,[422] wild yams, coffee-plants, cinnamon,\r\npepper-vines, _Andromedas_, _Osbeckias_, wild ginger, a _Balanophra_\r\nwith a scarlet flower, and abundance of orchids and ferns. On the\r\nedge of the forest there was a little hut, merely a few branches\r\ncovered with grass, and leaning against the trunk of a tree, with\r\nsome empty honeycombs lying about. It was the habitation of a family\r\nof Mooloo Kurumbers, a wild race who live in the forests, and run\r\naway in great terror when any one approaches them. The establishment\r\nof the plantation will soon make them alter their haunts from the\r\nneighbourhood of Neddiwuttum.\r\n\r\nThe magnificent view from this point embraces a great part of Wynaad.\r\nFar below there was a small coffee-estate, its bright green contrasting\r\nwith the more sombre hues of the surrounding forest; and more to the\r\nleft, though out of sight, is the extensive plantation which, together\r\nwith a tract of forest on the slopes of the Neilgherries, is owned by\r\nMessrs. Ouchterlony and Campbell.\r\n\r\nAfter passing the night at Pycarrah, we started next morning to examine\r\nanother site further to the eastward, and overlooking the plateau of\r\nMysore. We crossed several ranges of grassy hills, with streams in the\r\nintervening valleys flowing through thickets of tree rhododendrons,\r\nwith the gorgeous crimson flowers just beginning to bloom, _Osbeckias_,\r\nand a _Lasianthus_ with a beautiful glossy leaf. The hills were\r\ndotted with a St. John's-wort with a bright orange flower (_Hypericum\r\nHookerianum_). We soon reached the edge of the plateau, overlooking\r\nthe low country, and looked down on the wide plains of Mysore, with\r\nsome Neilgherry peaks in advance of us, and a valley between, where\r\nthere was bright green cultivation, and crimson patches of amaranth,\r\nsurrounding the Badaga village of Choloor. Between the place where we\r\nstood and the Choloor valley there were some fine patches of forest on\r\nthe steep hill-slopes; but they did not offer the same advantages as\r\nNeddiwuttum for a first experimental chinchona plantation. This side\r\nof the hills is drier, the soil poorer, and water is less abundant,\r\nthough it is nearer Ootacamund, and both labour and supplies are more\r\neasily procurable. Returning to Ootacamund we rode up to a Todar-mund,\r\nwhere something unusual had evidently occurred. About thirty Todars\r\nwere walking in a line through the forest glades below, and several\r\njackals were prowling about in the broad daylight. We afterwards heard\r\nthat a huge tiger had killed one of the Todar buffaloes that morning,\r\nand retreated into the _shola_ on the edge of which we had just had\r\nluncheon. They expected him to come out at sunset for his supper.\r\n\r\nWe continued our excursion to the summit of the Kalhutty peak,\r\noverlooking the Seegoor ghaut, whence several fine tracts of\r\nforest-land slope down; but Neddiwuttum was decidedly preferable in\r\nevery respect to all the localities which we examined on the northern\r\nside of the Neilgherries, and to the eastward of that site. The part of\r\nthe hills on the south, towards Coonoor and Kotergherry, was out of the\r\nquestion on account of the summer drought, as it is completely screened\r\nfrom the south-west monsoon by the spurs from the Dodabetta peak; and\r\nthe forests towards the Sispara ghaut, being too far west to receive\r\nmoisture from the north-east monsoon, were not so good as Neddiwuttum,\r\nat least for a first experiment.\r\n\r\nWhen the success of the chinchona culture on the 400 acres of the\r\nNeddiwuttum plantation is fully established, the experiment may then\r\nbe extended to the east and west, both by Government and through\r\nprivate enterprise; and these precious barks may be expected to yield\r\nremunerative profits to European speculators, while they will at the\r\nsame time confer an inestimable blessing on the native population.\r\n\r\nEverything, however, depends upon the method which is adopted for the\r\ncultivation of the chinchona-plants in the experimental plantations;\r\nand, in a future chapter, I propose to give a detailed account of the\r\ncourse of events, as regards the chinchona-plants on the Neilgherry\r\nhills, up to the latest date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nJOURNEY TO THE PULNEY HILLS.\r\n\r\n  Coonoor ghaut--Coimbatore--Pulladom--Cotton\r\n  cultivation--Dharapurum--A marriage procession--Dindigul--Ryotwarry\r\n  tenure--Pulney hills--Kodakarnal--Extent of the\r\n  Pulneys--Formation--Soil--Climate--Inhabitants--Flora--Suitability for\r\n  chinchona cultivation--Forest conservancy--Anamallay hills.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the end of November I set out from Ootacamund, by way of the Coonoor\r\nghaut and Coimbatore, with the intention of examining the suitability\r\nof the Pulney hills in Madura for chinchona cultivation. The Coonoor\r\nghaut, on the southern side of the Neilgherry hills, leads down into\r\nthe plain of Coimbatore. The road is good, though much too steep ever\r\nto make a convenient means of carriage traffic, and the scenery is\r\nexceedingly fine. The deep gorge has forest-covered mountains on the\r\nleft, and a grand range of cliffs on the right, crowned by the bold\r\npeak of the Hoolicul Droog. There are few districts in India without\r\nsome local tradition respecting the five Pandus,[423] the great\r\nmythical heroes of ancient Hindoo history, and the Hoolicul Droog is\r\nnot without one. It is said that the fort on the summit of the Droog\r\nwas inhabited by a _rakshi_ or giant named Pukasooren, who levied a\r\ntribute on the people of the plains, in the shape of a cart-load of\r\nprovisions daily. When he had eaten the provisions he swallowed the\r\ndriver, and kicked the cart down again. Bhima, the impersonation of\r\nstrength, when passing through this part of the country, volunteered\r\nto act as driver, had a desperate encounter with the giant, and killed\r\nhim. The dying Pukasooren cursed the whole country over which the\r\nshadow of the mountain fell during the day, and it has ever since\r\nbeen the abode of a deadly fever. It is certain that the jungles at\r\nthe roots of the hills are the most fever-haunted districts in India,\r\nand I rode rapidly through this belt of forests, and along a road\r\nbordered with _cana-fistula_ and _sappan_-trees,[424] to the village of\r\nMatepoliem, on the banks of the river Bowany, and five miles from the\r\nfoot of the ghaut.\r\n\r\nMatepoliem is twenty-three miles from the town of Coimbatore, and I\r\nrode this distance on a Neilgherry pony in the early morning. The road\r\nis perfectly straight, with an avenue of shady trees along the whole\r\nlength, and good bridges over the dry sandy water-courses. The soil\r\nappeared to be poor, partly waste, and partly cultivated with _cholum_\r\n(_Sorghum Vulgare_[425]), _lablab_,[426] and sesame. _Cholum_, or great\r\nmillet, is much cultivated in the peninsula, and used as food in the\r\nshape of cakes and porridge, where rice is scarce or too expensive.\r\nIt grows to a height of five or six feet, and cattle are very fond of\r\nthe straw, which contains sugar, but it soon exhausts the soil, and\r\ntwo crops are never taken off the same land in succession. There are\r\ntwo villages on the road between Matepoliem and Coimbatore, called\r\nKaramuddy and Goodaloor, in both of which there is a _choultry_ or\r\nnative bungalow, and in the latter an English post-house. At Karamuddy\r\nthere is a very picturesque temple, and on the roadside I passed\r\nseveral horses of earthenware, votive offerings by the potters to their\r\ngod. Under many of the trees there are images of the elephant-headed,\r\npot-bellied god of wisdom, Ganesa, anointed with ghee, and adorned with\r\ngarlands of flowers.\r\n\r\nThe streets of Coimbatore consist of long rows of red-tiled, mud-walled\r\nbuildings, with no windows, and overhanging eaves supported by wooden\r\npillars, under which there are raised platforms where the people sit\r\nand talk. In peeping in at the doors, I could never discern any article\r\nof furniture in the dark obscurity of the interiors, but they generally\r\nlooked clean and well swept. The houses of the English officials\r\nare about a mile from the town, generally surrounded by park-like\r\ncompounds, but the trees and grass thrive badly in the shallow sandy\r\nsoil. Outside the town there are two very large tanks, one nearly a\r\nmile long, which irrigate some rice-fields. The view is very pretty,\r\nwith these extensive sheets of water in the foreground, the cupolas of\r\ntemples rising above the trees beyond, and Lambton's Peak with the blue\r\nline of the Neilgherries in the distance.\r\n\r\nSome exertions are being made at Coimbatore, both by Protestant and\r\nRoman Catholic missionaries, and about sixty natives attend the little\r\nchapel of the London Mission Society. The Bible is very properly\r\nnot admitted into any of the Government schools, and, strange to\r\nsay, educated natives often inquire why this is not done, and why\r\nChristians are ashamed of their Shaster. But in schools unconnected\r\nwith the Government the study of the Bible is enforced like any other\r\nclass-book, and there are upwards of forty Brahmin youths in Coimbatore\r\nwho habitually take it home to learn, with their other lessons, and\r\nnever make the slightest objection. Mr. Thomas, the Collector, felt\r\nvery strongly the great importance of educating the women, and a\r\ngirl-school has been set on foot, after much difficulty. At present\r\nthe influence of the women, and all women have influence, is for\r\nevil. The men, to maintain their superiority, dislike the women to\r\nknow anything, and the head official of the cutcherry at Coimbatore,\r\nwho is a Brahmin, dare not let his friends know that his wife can read\r\nand write, though this accomplishment makes her a more useful and\r\nagreeable companion. The women, generally, are treated like slaves\r\nby their husbands. They are never allowed to eat at the same time,\r\nexcept on the wedding-day, and must walk behind their husbands on a\r\njourney, generally carrying a child on their hips; yet I have seen the\r\nman carrying the child, and at least taking turn about, and in other\r\nrespects they always appeared to be on good terms with each other.\r\n\r\nAt Coimbatore I bought a _bandy_ or country cart of the simplest\r\nconstruction, with two wheels, no springs, and a hood of matting spread\r\nover curved canes; and started, with relays of bullocks posted at\r\nintervals of fifteen miles. This mode of travelling is inconceivably\r\nslow, the rate being about three miles an hour, and it was near sunset\r\nbefore I reached Pulladom, a village twenty-two miles from Coimbatore.\r\nThe road is nearly straight, and planted on both sides with trees of\r\nstunted growth, owing to the shallowness of the soil. It was market-day\r\nat Pulladom, and people were sitting in rows, before piles of cotton\r\ncloths, rice, and dry grains; while an old Tahsildar, in spectacles and\r\nsnow-white garments, was holding a court under a verandah. In strolling\r\nabout I came upon the huge idol-car belonging to the village, on heavy\r\nwooden trucks. The carvings on its sides were very elaborate, with\r\nelephant-headed gods at the angles; but it is only dragged out on very\r\ngreat occasions, and will require new trucks before it is moved again.\r\n\r\nAll this country round Coimbatore produces much cotton, and cloths\r\nare manufactured in great quantities, which supply garments, such\r\nas they are, for the people of the plains, as well as for the hill\r\ntribes of the Neilgherries. The native cotton is of two kinds, called\r\n_oopum-parati_ and _nadum parati_.[427] The seed of the latter is sown\r\nbroadcast, in the same field with _cholum_ and _cumboo_.[428] After the\r\ngrain is cut, the ground is ploughed between the plants four times, and\r\nin the next year the cotton yields a small crop in July, and a larger\r\none in the following January. After the third year the field is manured\r\nand cultivated with grain for two years, cotton being again sown when\r\nthe third crop of grain has been reaped. This _nadum_ cotton is very\r\nlittle cultivated in the Coimbatore district. The chief product is the\r\n_oopum_, the best indigenous cotton, raised, in rotations of two years,\r\nwith _cumboo_ and _cholum_.\r\n\r\nThe _oopum_ cotton is raised on the black soil,[429] an adhesive black\r\nclay, while the little Bourbon cotton that is cultivated is grown on\r\nred soil. It is picked very carelessly, and the bales are so badly\r\npressed that those which I passed in carts on the road looked as if\r\nthey would sink in like a feather-bed, if any one sat upon them.\r\n\r\nMuch pains have been taken by the Government for a series of years to\r\nimprove the method of cultivating cotton in India, and to introduce\r\nAmerican and other species; and very large sums of money have been\r\nspent on experiments. Bourbon cotton was cultivated in Coimbatore as\r\nearly as 1824; and in 1842 Government cotton-farms were established\r\nfor the growth of New Orleans and Indian plants, both in the black and\r\nred soils, under the able superintendence of Dr. Wight, the eminent\r\nbotanist. In 1849 these experiments were abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe great importance of the question of cotton supply from India has\r\nbeen long felt, and never more so than at the present time. To meet the\r\nrequirements of the English markets numerous and costly attempts have\r\nbeen made during a course of years to introduce the American species,\r\nwhich produces a much longer staple than the indigenous Indian kind.\r\nYet American cotton has not hitherto been raised so as to yield a\r\nprofitable return, excepting in the province of Dharwar, in the Bombay\r\nPresidency. The success in this instance is chiefly to be attributed\r\nto a suitable soil and climate; but also, in no small degree, to the\r\nenergy of Mr. Shaw, a former Collector.\r\n\r\nGreat attention has been paid to the nature of the soils, while less\r\nimportance than it really deserves has been attached to climate,\r\nthough climate, and mainly one element of climate--the moisture of the\r\natmosphere--is an essential condition in the successful culture of\r\nAmerican cotton. In travelling southward from the latitude of Bombay\r\nthe climate becomes gradually moister, and at 300 miles there is a\r\nvery decided change. The American cotton-plant has a very different\r\nconstitution from the Indian; it cannot stand so much drought, and the\r\nconditions required for its culture are an equable and moderate supply\r\nof moisture through all the stages of its growth. These conditions are\r\nfulfilled in the Dharwar country, which retains a considerable quantity\r\nof moisture in the air during the cold season, when other parts of the\r\nBombay Presidency are intensely dry. Wherever this is the case, as in\r\nSind, Guzerat, Broach, and Ahmednuggur, the American plant will not\r\nyield a remunerative crop. The indigenous plant is able to endure this\r\ndry season well, because it is a native, not of the peninsula, but of\r\nthe arid country of Sind and part of the Punjab, where it grows wild.\r\n\r\nIf careful hygrometrical observations were taken throughout the year\r\nin the various cotton districts, the results might be compared with\r\nsimilar observations taken in Dharwar; and thus the localities may be\r\nascertained where the American cotton can be advantageously cultivated,\r\nso far at least as this depends on the amount of moisture in the\r\natmosphere. The supply of aqueous vapour in the atmosphere, at any\r\nperiod of the year, diminishes as we recede from the coast; but, having\r\nonce found a centre where the American plant can be profitably raised,\r\nin Dharwar, it is advisable to work from that centre, especially in a\r\nsouth-eastern and southerly direction. This spread of the growth of\r\nAmerican cotton has already taken place to the eastward of Dharwar,\r\nto a considerable extent. The people in the Bellary district, and in\r\nneighbouring parts of the Nizam's territory, have for some years grown\r\ncotton from American seeds, and value it more highly than their native\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nIn Coimbatore, where scorching hot dry winds parch up the plains during\r\npart of the year, and where the rainfall varies so much in different\r\nseasons,[430] sometimes being thirty inches, and at others only seven\r\ninches, it is perhaps doubtful whether it will ever answer to cultivate\r\nAmerican cotton on a large scale, yet excellent samples were obtained\r\nfrom cotton raised on the farms, under the superintendence of Dr.\r\nWight. The attention of Sir William Denison, the present Governor of\r\nMadras, has been chiefly directed to the improvement of native cotton,\r\nby increasing the length of the staple, and lessening the coarseness\r\nof the fibre. It is a well-established fact that \"the best seeds make\r\nthe best breeds,\"[431] and Sir William Denison proposes to select\r\nthose seeds to which the largest fibres are attached, to be used for\r\nthe next crop, and so on in each successive season, the minimum length\r\nbeing increased every year. He believes that, in this way, a permanent\r\naddition may be made to the length, and possibly to the fineness of\r\nthe fibre of the native cotton, which might thus ultimately be able to\r\ncompete in the English markets with its American rival. Mr. Haywood,\r\nthe Secretary of the Manchester Cotton Company, on the other hand,\r\nstrongly urges that attention should be given to the improvement\r\nof American cotton. Well-directed efforts in both directions will\r\ndoubtless be rewarded.\r\n\r\nI left Pulladom in the night, and arrived at the large village of\r\nDharapurum in the following morning, a distance of twenty-eight\r\nmiles. Dharapurum is on the banks of a small river, where there are\r\nrice-fields and cocoanut-trees; for wherever there is the means of\r\nirrigation, rice is always cultivated. Great quantities of cows and\r\ncalves swarm along the roads, and in the open spaces of the village,\r\nwhere there are some fine spreading peepul-trees (_Ficus religiosa_),\r\none of the sacred trees of the Hindus. It has a peculiarly shaped\r\ncordate leaf, with a long narrow acumen one-third the length of the\r\nleaf, and yellow flowers; and it is venerated from a belief that the\r\ngod Vishnu was born amongst its branches. Potters' horses, and images\r\nof the elephant-headed Ganesa, were placed under the trees, the objects\r\nof worship by the villagers, who make offerings of ghee and flowers to\r\nthem. Literally \"an idol under every green tree.\"\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Dharapurum the road becomes very sandy, and passes over\r\na bleak open country covered with low bushes, on the frontier between\r\nthe Coimbatore and Madura collectorates. A range of mountains bounded\r\nthe view to the south. A slow jolting journey of thirty miles brought\r\nme to the village of Pulkanooth in Madura. _Cholum_ and _lablab_\r\nwere cultivated in the surrounding fields, and from the top of a\r\nridge of rocks overhanging the village there is an extensive view of\r\nopen country covered with waving _cholum_, and bounded by the broken\r\noutline of the Pulney hills. Near the village there is the ruin of a\r\nsquare brick fort, with bastions at the angles, entirely overgrown\r\nwith bushes. One of the happiest signs of English rule is to be found\r\nin the number of ruined forts scattered over the country, once the\r\nlurking-places of brutal robbers who extorted half the crops from a\r\nwretched peasantry, whose descendants now reap the fruits of their\r\nlabour in peace.\r\n\r\nIn taking a walk near Pulkanooth I encountered a marriage procession.\r\nFirst came a man with a drum, then two more with a gong of skin\r\nstretched on wooden hoops, then a man with a large game-cock under\r\nhis arm, then a bullock led by a woman, then four women covered with\r\nbracelets and anklets, then a pony ridden by a boy about twelve, with\r\nnothing on but a red turban and gold necklace and bracelets, with a\r\nlittle girl about five in front, whom he clasped round the waist; then\r\nmore men and women, another drum, and lastly a small boy mounted on a\r\nlarge cow. They appeared to have come from a distance, as they stopped\r\nto rest under a peepul-tree, by the road-side.\r\n\r\nAnother night journey took me to the town of Dindigul, a pretty\r\nlittle place at the foot of an isolated mass of primitive rock, whose\r\nperpendicular sides are crowned by a dismantled fort, said to have\r\nbeen erected in the days of Dupleix and French ambition, and to have\r\nbeen occupied and long held by Hyder Ali of Mysore. Here the plains\r\nare chiefly covered with _cholum_ and _cumboo_; and between the town\r\nand the rock there is a grassy esplanade, a grove of cocoanut and\r\nbetel-palms, and a neat little temple to Ganesa. Troops of young\r\ngirls were drawing water from a tank near the esplanade. Their slight\r\ngraceful figures, supporting chatties on their heads, were perfect\r\nmodels of beauty; but they had black ugly faces, flabby ear-lobes, and\r\nlarge studs stuck in their noses. To be admired their backs must be\r\nturned.\r\n\r\nThe Tamil people, who inhabit this part of India, are an exceedingly\r\nblack and ugly race, and the Brahmins are the only people who have\r\nany pretensions whatever to fair skins. On the whole the peasantry in\r\nthe country between the Neilgherry and Pulney hills appeared to be\r\ntolerably well off, and the country was well cultivated, considering\r\nthe unpropitious climate and poor soil. As is well known, the\r\npeople in this part of India hold their land by what is called the\r\n_ryotwarry_ tenure, which is a settlement for the land assessment with\r\neach individual ryot or cultivator, without the intervention of any\r\nzemindar or renter. The land is made over to the actual cultivator,\r\nwho is regarded by the Government as the proprietor of the soil, and\r\nthe arrangement for the payment of land-tax is made directly with\r\nhim, while he receives assistance by remissions of assessment in\r\nunfavourable seasons, and cannot be ejected so long as he pays his dues.\r\n\r\nThe land is classified as irrigated and un-irrigated, and then\r\naccording to its different degrees of fertility; and this settlement\r\nis permanent so long as the land remains in the same condition. The\r\nCollector of each district makes an annual tour of inspection, called\r\n_jummabundy_, to ascertain the extent to which the Government demand\r\nought to be reduced, owing to particular circumstances of season; but\r\nin ordinary times the duty of collection is intrusted to the Tahsildars\r\nor native officials, and their subordinates the Sheristadars. These\r\nofficials, who visited me in the villages through which I passed,\r\nappeared intelligent respectable men, and all the younger ones talked\r\nEnglish fluently.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Munro, who was Governor of Madras from 1818 to 1827,\r\nestablished the _ryotwarry_ system, and since his time the conditions\r\non which the ryots hold their land have been made lighter and more\r\nadvantageous. In 1837 it was enacted that there should be no increase\r\nof land-tax on account of the growth of more valuable crops; in 1852\r\nit was ordered that no ryot should pay an additional tax on account of\r\nimprovements made by himself, causing an increased value;[432] and,\r\nduring Lord Harris's administration, considerable reductions were made\r\nin the land-assessment in nearly all the Madras collectorates. These\r\nreductions, independent of the boon conferred on the people, have been\r\nattended by the most successful results, in an increasing revenue,\r\nand in the extension of the area of cultivation over lands which were\r\nformerly waste.\r\n\r\nDindigul is about forty miles from the foot of the ghaut leading up to\r\nthe Pulney hills, and relays of bullocks were posted for me every seven\r\nmiles, with a man running in front of the cart with a blazing torch.\r\nPassing through the village of Periacolum, round which there are many\r\nlarge tanks and extensive rice cultivation, we reached the jungle at\r\nthe foot of the Pulney hills at early dawn. The path, which is only\r\npracticable for ponies and pack-bullocks, leads up a ravine for half\r\nthe distance, and then corkscrews up the steep sides of the mountain.\r\nThe range looks very imposing from the plain, but not equal to the\r\nNeilgherries at the foot of the Coonoor ghaut. After resting under a\r\nclump of trees I commenced the ascent on foot, driving an unhappy sheep\r\nbefore me, which was to be sacrificed on the summit, where, at this\r\ntime of the year, there are no residents, no market, and no means of\r\nprocuring any supplies.\r\n\r\nThe ascent is exceedingly beautiful, but the undergrowth is thick\r\ngrass, and the vegetation is not nearly so luxuriant as at similar\r\nelevations on the Neilgherries. The trees are chiefly _Leguminosæ_, and\r\nat an elevation of 3000 feet chinchonaceous plants commence, amongst\r\nwhich I observed the _Hymenodictyon excelsum_. At 6000 feet the steep\r\nascent is covered with long grass, and trees are confined to sheltered\r\nhollows and ravines. After reaching the plateau it is necessary to\r\nscale a second steep grassy slope before arriving at the settlement of\r\nKodakarnal, which is 7230 feet above the level of the sea. Kodakarnal\r\nconsists of eight houses, built along the crests of undulating hills,\r\nand one of the inner slopes is clothed with a wood of fine trees and\r\ntree-ferns, from which the Tamil people have named the settlement.[433]\r\nRound the houses there are gum-trees. _Acacia heterophylla_, _Cassia\r\nglauca_, fruit-trees, and hedges of roses and geraniums as at\r\nOotacamund. The houses belong to the officials of the Madura district,\r\nthe American missionaries, a Mr. Clerk of Madras, and the French priest\r\nof Pondicherry, who come here to recruit their healths, and for short\r\nintervals of holiday and relaxation.\r\n\r\nMr. Ames, the Sub-Collector at Dindigul, had kindly given me the use of\r\na house which he shared with Mr. Levinge, the Collector of Madura. It\r\nhas a pleasant garden, whence there is a glorious view of the Madura\r\nplains, with their numerous tanks glittering in the sun; and close\r\nto the house a torrent of deliciously cold water babbles over huge\r\nboulders of rock, and finally leaps in long falls down the face of the\r\ncliffs, making a noise at night like the roar of the sea. The house\r\nwas in charge of a very original old native of low caste, with a large\r\nfamily, named Chenatumby, who is a tolerable gardener, and cultivates\r\nhis own patch of potatoes. Chenatumby is a devoted Protestant, feels\r\na conscientious horror for the idolatry of the Roman Catholics, and\r\nintends to bring up his eldest son as a half-caste, this honour being\r\nconferred on him by the simple process of attiring him in a hat and\r\ntrousers. Old Chenatumby acted as a guide in my walks over the hills,\r\nand was very useful.\r\n\r\nThe Pulney[434] or Varragherry hills, like the Neilgherries further\r\nnorth, branch out in an easterly direction from the main line of the\r\nwestern ghauts. United to a portion of the Anamallay range at their\r\nwestern end, they stretch out into the Madura plains for a distance of\r\nfifty-four miles, with a medium breadth of fifteen, and an area of 798\r\nsquare miles. On the south they rise very abruptly from the plains,\r\npresenting, near their summits, a perfect wall of gneiss; but on the\r\nnorth and east they slope down in a succession of broken ridges. The\r\nPulneys are divided into two parts: a lower series of hill and dale to\r\nthe eastward, called Mailmullay or Kunnundaven, averaging a height of\r\n4000 feet, and covering 231-1/2 square miles, where there are extensive\r\ntracts of forest, some cultivation, and several villages; and a loftier\r\nregion to the westward 6000 to 7500 feet above the sea, with undulating\r\ngrassy hills and mountain-peaks, the highest of which, Permanallie,\r\nattains an elevation of 8000 feet.\r\n\r\nThe formation is gneiss, interstratified with quartz, and traversed by\r\nveins of felspar; and the rock is generally decayed to a considerable\r\ndepth on the plateau, and disintegrated so as to form a gritty clay. In\r\nthe eastern part the soil is a light reddish loam; but on the western\r\nand loftier half it is very poor, being a heavy black peat several feet\r\nthick, with a stiff and plastic yellowish clay as a sub-soil. The rains\r\non the Neilgherry hills have the effect of mixing the decaying grass\r\nwith the decomposed rock, and a rich soil is thus formed; but on the\r\nplateau of the Pulneys this operation does not appear to take place,\r\nthe one becoming a black peat, and the other a stiff clayey subsoil.\r\nThese remarks, however, only apply to the interior valleys, for on\r\nthe outer slopes, overlooking the plains of Madura, there is plenty of\r\ngood soil, and magnificent forests clothe the mountains at the foot of\r\nthe perpendicular walls of gneiss which form the southern ridge of the\r\nPulneys.\r\n\r\nThe climate of the Pulneys, as regards temperature, very closely\r\nresembles that of the Neilgherries. At the time of my visit, in the end\r\nof November and beginning of December, the season was very late, though\r\nthere were thick mists and showers of rain every afternoon. This is\r\nthe time of the north-east monsoon, and the streams swell to torrents\r\nafter every shower. During the first two months in the year it is very\r\ncold, and the ground is often covered with frost on the upper plateau.\r\nIn March there are light showers of rain, which increase during April\r\nand May, and continue, with strong westerly winds, until October. Thus\r\nthe Pulneys are within the influence of the south-west monsoon.[435] In\r\nJune and July, the warmest months, the thermometer never falls below\r\n50°, nor rises above 75°; and the westerly winds, with occasional rain,\r\ncontinue during August and September.\r\n\r\nThe eastern part of the Pulneys, called Kunnundaven, and Poombary,\r\nthe principal village to the westward, are inhabited by people of the\r\nKunnuver and Karakat Vellaler castes, numbering about two thousand of\r\nboth sexes. The villages are chiefly on the lower Pulneys, and one\r\nwhich I visited, called Vilputty, was surrounded by terrace cultivation\r\nof mustard, garlic, _raggee_, and _keeree_ or amaranth. The people also\r\ncultivate _lablab_, limes, oranges, and plantains; and I heard that in\r\none or two villages there were small coffee-gardens. Many low-country\r\nnatives are also settled on the Pulneys, chiefly men outlawed from\r\ntheir castes; and in the more inaccessible forests are the Poliars, a\r\nrace of timid wild men of the woods. Chenatumby told me that they have\r\nno habitations of any kind, but run through the jungle from place to\r\nplace, sleep under rocks, and live on wild honey and roots. The women\r\nrun with them, like wild goats, their children slung in rows on their\r\nhips. The Poliars occasionally trade with the country people, who place\r\ncotton and grain on some stone, and the wild creatures, as soon as the\r\nstrangers are out of sight, take them and put honey in their place, but\r\nthey will allow no one to come near them.\r\n\r\nThe undulating hills and valleys of the interior plateau are\r\ncovered with an aromatic grass (_Andropogon_), which grows in large\r\ncoarse tufts, like the _Stipa ychu_ in Peru; and it is not until\r\nthe young tender shoots come out that it affords good pasture for\r\ncattle, of which there is a small herd on the hills, belonging to\r\nAmerican missionaries and others. The grassy slopes are dotted with\r\ntree-Rhododendrons, Gaultherias, Osbeckias, Lobelias, the _Hypericum\r\nHookerianum_, and brake ferns. This upper plateau is admirably adapted\r\nfor the growth of English fruits and vegetables. In Mr. Levinge's\r\ngarden there were bushes of Fuchsias, Daturas, roses, and geraniums;\r\nand behind the house grew peach, apple, plum, and loquot-trees,\r\nstrawberries, potatoes, green peas, and artichokes.\r\n\r\nWhere there are springs or watercourses on the higher range, there are\r\ngenerally fine wooded \"_sholas_\" facing inwards, and very extensive\r\ntracts of forest on the outer slopes; but the timber, especially teak\r\nand black-wood, has been very extensively cut by the people of the\r\nhills. I examined a _shola_ called Minmurdi-karnal near Pattoor, on the\r\nsouth side, another between that and Kodakarnal, and two others, and\r\nobserved trees of the following genera:-- _Michelia_, _Cinnamomum_,\r\n_Dodonæa_, _Millingtonia_, _Myrsine_, _Monocera_, _Symplocos_,\r\n_Bignonia_, _Crotalaria_, _Passiflora_, _Osbeckia_, _Jasminum_,\r\n_Hedyotis_, _Lasianthus_, _Canthium_, and _Hymenodictyon_. Tree-ferns\r\nabound near the streams, and in some of the jungles there were trees\r\nof enormous size. Early one morning I went with Chenatumby to see the\r\n\"pillar-rocks,\" three miles to the westward of Kodakarnal. They consist\r\nof grand perpendicular cliffs descending from the grassy heights, with\r\ntheir bases clothed with forest. Two of them are separated by fissures\r\nfrom the main cliff, and have the appearance of gigantic columns. It\r\nwas altogether a most magnificent sight, with volumes of fleecy clouds\r\nrolling up from the low country, and occasional peeps of the far-away\r\nplains and glittering tanks through their folds.\r\n\r\nThe natives have long been in the habit of recklessly felling the\r\nmost valuable timber, and acres of fine _shola_ used to be annually\r\ndestroyed to make clearings for plantain and cardamom groves. For\r\nthe latter, however, only the small trees and underwood are burnt on\r\nthe Pulneys, the larger trees being left standing. But this wasteful\r\ndestruction of timber has recently been checked by the authorities,\r\nand in 1860 Mr. Spershneider was appointed as overseer of the Pulney\r\nforests, with a small staff, to prevent the reckless cutting of timber,\r\nand to mark, from year to year, the trees which arrive at sufficient\r\nmaturity, and are fit to be felled.\r\n\r\nI came to the conclusion that in several of the wooded _sholas_\r\nthe chinchona-plant might be cultivated with advantage, the _C.\r\nCondaminea_, and other species which thrive at great elevations, on the\r\nupper plateau, and the _C. succirubra_ in Kunnundaven. Mr. Levinge,\r\nthe Collector of Madura, takes an interest in the experiment, and Mr.\r\nSpershneider would be willing to superintend the chinchona plantations;\r\nso that, when the undertaking is in a sufficiently advanced stage on\r\nthe Neilgherry hills to enable Mr. McIvor to distribute plants for\r\ncultivation in other parts of India, a number might advantageously be\r\nsent to the Pulneys. I understand, too, that it is in contemplation\r\nto form a Company for the cultivation of coffee on these hills,\r\nin which case it is to be hoped that the extension of the growth\r\nof chinchona-plants will be advanced by private enterprise, from\r\nmotives of humanity as well as with a view to successful commercial\r\nspeculation.[436]\r\n\r\nI did not visit the Anamallay hills, to the south of Coimbatore and\r\nwestward of the Pulneys, as no planter was as yet established on\r\nthem, and a considerable time must elapse before they are prepared\r\nfor the introduction of the chinchona-plant. At the time of my visit\r\nno bold clearer of jungles had ventured to invade the domains of the\r\nconservators of forests on the Anamallays.\r\n\r\nDr. Cleghorn reports that these hills are under the influence of the\r\nsouth-west monsoon, though not so much so as the Koondahs at Sispara:\r\nbut I do not find that he gives any detailed account of the amount of\r\nmoisture in the atmosphere during the winter. The soil is described\r\nas deep and covered with rich pasture, streams of water are numerous,\r\nthere are table-lands 6000 to 7000 feet above the sea, and very\r\nfine timber in the ravines. The three hill-tribes, called Kaders,\r\nPoliars, and Malsars, trade in cardamoms, turmeric, ginger, honey,\r\nwax, resins, soapnuts, and millet. Dr. Cleghorn considers that, from\r\nthe extent of forest, the resemblance of the flora to that of Ceylon,\r\nand the altitude, the Anamallays are suitable for the cultivation of\r\ncoffee on a large scale, and for colonization of small communities of\r\nEnglishmen.[437] In this case they are also adapted for the growth\r\nof chinchona-plants, and their introduction, which will of course\r\nbe simultaneous with the settlement of Europeans, will be the more\r\nbeneficial because the lower slopes of the Anamallays are the haunts\r\nof fevers. The quinine-yielding trees will confer blessings on those\r\nwhose duties or interests oblige them to frequent the forests of the\r\nAnamallays, while their cultivation will be a remunerative speculation\r\nto the settlers on the upper plateau.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nMADURA AND TRICHINOPOLY.\r\n\r\n  Arrive at Madura--Peopling of India--The Dravidian race--Brahmin\r\n  colonists in Southern India--Foundation of Madura--Pandyan\r\n  dynasty--Tamil literature--Aghastya--Naik dynasty--The Madura\r\n  Pagoda--The Sangattar--The Choultry--Tirumalla Naik's palace--Caste\r\n  prejudices--Trichinopoly--Coleroon anicut--Rice cultivation--The\r\n  palmyra palm--Caroor--Return to the Neilgherries--Shervaroy\r\n  hills--Courtallum.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE road from the foot of the Pulney hills to Madura, a distance of\r\nupwards of forty miles, is very bad, but it passes through avenues of\r\nshady banyan and peepul trees most of the way, and is, therefore, not\r\nso wearisome for the natives on foot, as for a European jolting at the\r\nrate of three miles an hour in a bullock-cart without springs.\r\n\r\nNear Madura there are tracts of rice cultivation, plantain groves, and\r\ntopes of palm-trees; and at sunrise I came in sight of the _gopurams_\r\nor towers of the great pagoda, rising above thick groves of palmyra\r\npalms, with a foreground of bright green paddy-fields. The city is\r\nvery interesting from its remarkable palaces and temples, as the\r\ncapital of a once powerful kingdom, and as the ancient centre of Tamil\r\ncivilization: and a few words respecting the former history of this\r\npart of India appear necessary before describing the pagoda, and other\r\narchitectural remains of the former greatness of Madura.\r\n\r\nTradition relates that in the most ancient times the country from the\r\nmouths of the Godavery to Cape Comorin was one vast forest. Here the\r\ngreat Aryan hero Rama is said to have resided during his exile, with\r\nhis wife Sita, and here he commenced his wars against the Rakshasas\r\nor fiends, who divided with hermits and sages the possession of the\r\nwilderness. The simple truth probably is that these \"fiends\" were the\r\noriginal inhabitants of Southern India, which was called Dravida Desa,\r\nand that Rama was the first Hindu invader. Dravida denotes the country\r\nof the Dravidas, who are described in Sanscrit writings as men of an\r\noutcast tribe, descended from degraded Kshatriyas.\r\n\r\nThe history of the early peopling of India, by its various races,\r\nis involved in much obscurity; and the little light which has been\r\nthrown upon it is chiefly derived from a comparison of languages. The\r\nprevailing opinion is that India was originally inhabited by a people\r\nwhose remains are to be found in the Koles, Sontals, Bheels, and other\r\nwild hill tribes; that the Dravidians, a Scythic people, came from the\r\nnorth, settled in Hindustan, and drove the aborigines into the hills\r\nand fastnesses; that in their turn the Dravidians were driven across\r\nthe Vindhya mountains by another Scythic race, and became the ancestors\r\nof the present population of Southern India; and that finally the Aryan\r\nrace, with its Vedic civilization, brought this pre-Aryan Scythic race\r\nunder subjection, and formed it into the servile Sudra caste.\r\n\r\nThus the Dravidian people of Southern India were of Scythic origin,\r\nand they spoke a language from which the four modern ones of the\r\nMadras Presidency, Tamil, Telugu, Canarese, and Malayalam,[438] are\r\nderived. These are all grouped as Dravidian languages, and their source\r\nis no longer a matter of doubt. It was formerly supposed that they\r\nwere Aryan, from the great number of apparently Indo-Germanic roots;\r\nbut it is now known, from the structure of their grammar, that they\r\nbelong to the great Turanian or Scythic group of tongues. Mr. Caldwell\r\nconsiders that the Scythian family to which they are most closely\r\nallied is the Finnish or Ugrian;[439] and in this view Professor Max\r\nMüller concurs with him.[440] The ancient Dravidian religion, before\r\nthe people were converted to the belief taught in the Puranas, also\r\nfavours Mr. Caldwell's view. If we may judge from the creed which still\r\nlingers in Tinnevelly and other districts, it consisted in the worship\r\nof evil spirits by means of bloody sacrifices and frantic dances,\r\nwhile a Supreme Being was acknowledged but not venerated, and there\r\nwas no trace of worship of the elements. In these respects it closely\r\nresembled the Shamanism of the Scythic races of High Asia.\r\n\r\nIt is tolerably certain that the Dravidian races had attained to some\r\ndegree of civilization before the Aryans appeared in their country,\r\nand, with a system of castes, introduced the worship of Vishnu and\r\nSiva. One evidence of the ancient civilization of the Dravidians is\r\nthat they possessed a system of numerals up to 1000, essentially the\r\nsame in all the four languages; though in counting above 1000 they make\r\nuse of Sanscrit numerals. From the existence of these native numerals\r\namong the Dravidian nations, Mr. Crawford draws the inference that\r\nthese people must have attained a considerable measure of civilization\r\nbefore they adopted the Hinduism of the north, and hence stood in no\r\nneed of foreign numerals.[441]\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Rama, who appears to have been assisted in his\r\ninvasion of Lanka (Ceylon) by a Dravidian chief, now deified as the\r\nmonkey God Hanuman, the influence of Hinduism rapidly increased, and\r\ncaste prejudices spread over Southern India. But the annals are far too\r\nobscure, and too deeply buried under extravagant fable, to enable us to\r\nform any idea of the time and manner of the complete inoculation of the\r\nDravidian races with Brahminical legends, caste observances, and Hindu\r\nreligious ideas. It is clear, however, that \"to the early Brahminical\r\ncolonists the Dravidians are indebted for the higher arts of life, and\r\nthe first elements of literary culture.\"[442]\r\n\r\nThe Brahmins came to Southern India not as conquerors, but as peaceful\r\nsettlers and instructors; and their influence was obtained through\r\ntheir superior civilization and learning. They gave the name of Sudra\r\nto all the upper and middle classes of native Dravidians, while the\r\nservile classes were not, as in Hindustan, called Sudras, but Pariars.\r\nThus, while in the north a Sudra is a low-caste man, in the south he\r\nranks next to a Brahmin.\r\n\r\nIt is said that, after the avatur of Rama, pilgrims came in great\r\nnumbers to visit the scenes of his triumphs, and, settling in the\r\ncountry, cleared land for cultivation, and laid the foundations of\r\nfuture principalities. One of these settlers was a man named Pandya,\r\nof the Vellaler or agricultural caste, who established himself in\r\nthe south; and his descendant Kula Sekhara, son of Sampanna Pandya,\r\nwas the first king of Madura. Some centuries elapsed, probably five,\r\nbefore the foundation of the city of Madura, during which the settlers\r\nwere occupied in clearing the ground, and forming themselves into an\r\norganized state; and it has been conjectured that the building of the\r\ncapital was commenced between 500 and 600 B.C. Previously the kings of\r\nthe Pandyan dynasty resided at a place called Kurkhi.[443]\r\n\r\nAnother tradition states that a merchant lost his way in the forests,\r\nand discovered an ancient temple dedicated to Siva and his wife Durga,\r\nwhich had been erected by the God Indra. The merchant was directed by\r\nthe God to announce to the Pandyan king, named Kula Sekhara, that it\r\nwas the will of Siva that a city should be erected on the spot. Kula\r\nSekhara, therefore, cleared the forest, rebuilt the temple, and founded\r\na city. On the completion of the work a shower of nectareal dew fell\r\nfrom heaven, spreading a sweet film on the ground, and hence the name\r\nof _Madura_ (sweet).[444]\r\n\r\nThe wife of Siva became incarnate as the daughter and successor of this\r\nprince, under the name of Minakshi; and Siva himself as Sundara, or the\r\nhandsome, was her mortal husband. Thus the Pandyan kings, like many\r\nof the dynasties of ancient Greece, placed their gods at the head of\r\ntheir genealogical tree. The immigration of a colony of Aryan Brahmins\r\nfrom Magadha into the Madura country, and the commencement of Tamil\r\ncivilization and literature, have been placed, by Mr. Caldwell and\r\nothers, in about the seventh century B.C.\r\n\r\nAt the Christian æra the kings of Madura were very powerful, and had\r\nextended their dominions over the whole of the peninsula. They sent two\r\nembassies to Rome--the first in the eighteenth year after the death of\r\nJulius Cæsar, which found the Emperor Augustus at Tarragona; and the\r\nsecond six years later, when he was at Samos.[445] Subsequently the\r\nkingdom was reduced in size by the independence of Malabar, the rise\r\nof Chira in the west, of the state of Chola in the east, and of Ramnad\r\nin the south.[446] A long list of kings is mentioned in the native\r\nannals, with numerous wars, first against the Buddhists, and afterwards\r\nwith the Rajahs of Chola and Ramnad.\r\n\r\nThe most flourishing period of Madura history appears to have been\r\nduring the reigns of Vamsa Sekhara and his son Vamsa Churamani, in\r\nabout 200 A.D. They erected grand temples and palaces, and the more\r\nancient and massive parts of edifices still in existence probably\r\ndate from their reigns. A college, called _Sangattar_, was founded\r\nat Madura, at this time, for the cultivation of the Tamil language\r\nand literature.[447] The first stimulus was given to this movement\r\nby the famous _Rishi_ or sage, Aghastya, the leader of a colony of\r\nBrahmins, whose migration to the south is mentioned in the Ramayana.\r\nHe was a chief agent in diffusing the worship of Siva in the Deccan;\r\nand it is supposed that there was a second man of learning of the\r\nsame name in the eighth or ninth century. Aghastya is said to have\r\nbeen the offspring of two gods, Mithra and Varuna, and he received\r\nthe Brahminical string from seven holy prophets. He became a most\r\nwonderful and enlightened personage, and composed works on medicine,\r\nmoral and natural philosophy, and botany, in high Tamil verse, called\r\n_Yellacanum_, greatly improving and refining his adopted language.\r\nAghastya's memory is deeply venerated by the Tamil people, and his\r\nhealing spirit is still believed to hover amongst the mountains\r\nof Courtallum, in Tinnevelly;[448] where he is worshipped as\r\n_Agast-isvara_, or the star Canopus.\r\n\r\nFrom the ninth to the tenth centuries the Jain religion predominated\r\nin Madura. The Jains were animated by a national and anti-Brahminical\r\nfeeling, and it is chiefly to them that Tamil is indebted for its high\r\nculture and independence of Sanscrit. They were expelled in the reign\r\nof Sundara Pandya, at about the time when Marco Polo visited India.\r\nThe Mohammedans first made an inroad into the Deccan in the reign of\r\nAlla-ud-deen of Delhi in 1293, they crossed the Kistna in 1310, and\r\nadvanced as far as Rameswara in 1374.\r\n\r\nAfter reigning for many centuries the Pandyan dynasty became tributary\r\nto the powerful Brahminical kingdom of Bijayanuggur in Mysore,\r\nin about 1380 A.D. A list of more than seventy kings is given in\r\nthe annals.[449] But in the fifteenth century an officer of the\r\nBijayanuggur Rajah, named Nagama Naik, was installed as feudatory\r\nKing of Madura, and founded the Naik dynasty. He procured the cession\r\nof Trichinopoly from the Chola Rajah, and his son Viswanath Naik\r\ndistributed the district of Tinnevelly amongst his adherents of\r\nthe Totia caste, the ancestors of the Poligars of Tinnevelly. His\r\ndescendant Tirumalla Naik, who succeeded in 1623 A.D., had a long\r\nand flourishing reign, and public edifices still furnish splendid\r\nproofs of his wealth and magnificence. He died in 1657 A.D.; and the\r\nNaik dynasty, which came to an end in 1730 A.D.,[450] was followed by\r\nobscure feudatories of the Nawabs of the Carnatic, who eventually made\r\nway for British rule.\r\n\r\nI went early one morning, with Mr. Levinge the Collector, to visit the\r\ngreat pagoda of Madura, some of the oldest parts of which date from\r\nthe reigns of Pandyan kings in the eighth century. It covers twenty\r\nacres of ground, and is surrounded by a high stone wall painted in red\r\nand white stripes, the Hindoo holy colours. The walls form a perfect\r\nsquare, and in the centre of each side there is a lofty _gopuram_ or\r\ntower. These towers are broad, solid, and very lofty masses of brick,\r\nin the form of a truncated pyramid. From the base to the summit they\r\nare one mass of sculptured figures, representing all the gods in Hindu\r\nmythology, rising tier above tier to the summit, and decreasing in size\r\nwith the height. Each end of the top of the _gopuram_ is ornamented\r\nby a fan-shaped structure of brick-work, representing the hood of a\r\ncobra. We entered the pagoda by a gateway in the left corner of the\r\nwall facing the great _choultry_ built by Tirumalla Naik. Here the\r\nwarden of the pagoda was waiting for us, who had arrived just before in\r\nhis palkee. He is of Sudra caste, a man advanced in years, and of much\r\nreputed holiness; and he received us in a state of nudity, with the\r\nexception of a yellow gauze scarf, his belly, chest, and forehead being\r\nsmeared with holy ashes. A crowd of Brahmins accompanied us.\r\n\r\nA long corridor leads from the entrance to the cloister, with a roof\r\nsupported by stone pillars, between which elephants were stationed,\r\ngaudily painted and caparisoned. The cloister is the finest part of\r\nthe interior of the pagoda. The walls are covered with paintings\r\nrepresenting the marvellous adventures of Krishna, and the pillars\r\nsupporting the roof of the galleries are roughly carved. The central\r\nspace is occupied by \"the tank of the golden lotus,\" with very dirty\r\ngreen water, and stone steps leading down from the cloister. The view\r\nfrom one corner of this tank is very striking; with green stagnant\r\nwater as a foreground, rows of fantastically-carved pillars supporting\r\nthe gallery on the opposite side, with the lofty _gopurams_ in the\r\nrear, rising as it were from the graceful fronds of cocoanut-trees\r\nwhich waved over the roof of the cloisters. Sacred monkeys were running\r\nabout in all directions over the roofs.\r\n\r\nThe _Sangattar_ or literary college of Madura held its sittings in\r\nthis cloister; and Siva is said to have presented it with a diamond\r\nbench which extended itself readily for such persons as were worthy to\r\nbe on a level with the sages of the _Sangattar_, and excluded all who\r\ntried to sit on it without possessing the necessary qualifications.\r\nIn other words, the learned corporation of Madura maintained a strict\r\nand exclusive monopoly. One day a man of the Pariar or lowest caste,\r\nnamed Tiruvallavar, appeared as a candidate for a seat on the bench of\r\n_Sangattar_ professors. The sages were indignant at his presumption,\r\nbut, as he was patronized by the Rajah, they were obliged to give his\r\nbook a trial. It was to find a place on the bench, which the professors\r\ntook care to occupy fully. But the miraculous bench extended itself\r\nto receive the book, which expanded and thrust all the sages off into\r\n\"the tank of the golden lotus,\" and the _Sangattar_ was abolished. This\r\ntook place in about the ninth century, and the work of Tiruvallavar,\r\ncalled _kural_, and consisting of 1330 aphorisms, still exists, and\r\nis the oldest extant work in Tamil literature. Though rejected by the\r\n_Sangattar_, on account of the low caste of its author, it was received\r\nby the Rajah and people; and the college was abolished, or perhaps\r\ndissolved itself from mortification at this defeat.\r\n\r\nIn a corner of the cloister is the entrance to one of the _gopurams_,\r\nand we went up to the top. Holding on by the cobra's hood which crowns\r\nthe tower, there was an extensive view of the town of Madura and\r\nsurrounding country, with its bright green rice cultivation, groves of\r\npalmyra-palms, broad expanses of water, isolated masses of rock, and\r\nthe Pulney hills in the far distance.\r\n\r\nWe passed from the cloister, and walked round the corridors which\r\nsurround the holy of holies containing the _Sokalinga_, the sacred\r\nemblem of the God Siva, which no one but a Brahmin can enter; and the\r\ntemple of Minakshi, his fish-eyed wife. The pillars in these corridors\r\nare curiously carved in the form of dancing-girls, elephant-headed\r\nGods, Sivas, and bulls. Here I was decorated with garlands of flowers\r\nby the warden of the temple, and I saw that there was a flower-garden\r\nin a small enclosure near the cloister, to supply offerings of flowers\r\nfor the ceremonial worship in the temple. In the Hindu religion\r\nbright-coloured or fragrant flowers take a prominent place as offerings\r\nto the gods. The arrows of Kama, the God of Love, were tipped with\r\nfive flowers:[451] the _asoka_ (_Jonesia pinnata_), a beautiful\r\nflower diversified with orange, scarlet, and bright-yellow tints, is\r\nconsecrated to Siva; the lotus-flower, called _kamata_ or _padma_,\r\nto Vishnu and his wife Lakshmi; a sweet-scented jasmine (_Jasminum\r\nundulatum_) to Vishnu, and Mariama the Goddess of Pariars; the superb\r\ncrimson _Ixora Bandhuca_ is offered at the shrines of Vishnu and Siva;\r\nand the _Nauclea Cadumba_, a stately tree, yields the holiest flower in\r\nIndia.[452] In an angle of one of the corridors all the jewels of the\r\ntemple were spread out on a table for our inspection, and we sat down\r\nbefore them, by the side of the old warden. It was a truly magnificent\r\ndisplay of wealth; and it was impossible not to feel that there must\r\nbe deep faith and conviction in a religion which induces men to go\r\nabout naked and in ashes, and to devote tens of thousands of rupees\r\nto ornament the mystic emblems of their Gods. I particularly noticed\r\nsome sapphires of extraordinary size and brilliancy; the cover of the\r\n_lingam_, a cylinder of pure gold, four feet high, encrusted with\r\npearls and rubies; the golden sceptre of Siva, three feet long, and one\r\nmass of rubies; the golden shoes and gauntlets of Siva and Minakshi,\r\ninlaid with rubies, emeralds, and pearls; the head-dress of Minakshi of\r\ngold Trichinopoly-work, adorned with pearls and rubies, with enormous\r\nemeralds hanging from it; her playthings, consisting of golden birds\r\noverlaid with rubies and emeralds; and necklaces and bracelets covered\r\nwith jewels of priceless value. There was also a costly gold chain\r\npresented by Mr. Peters, a former Collector, and another which had\r\nlately arrived from Agra, in an anonymous letter addressed to the\r\npagoda.\r\n\r\nFrom this corridor I was able to peep down a dark passage at the end of\r\nwhich there were some dim lights surrounding the sacred _Soka-linga_,\r\nbut I could not distinguish anything. The warden told us that it was\r\na piece of solid rock cropping out of the ground, and cut into the\r\nshape of a cylinder, with a rounded top, as the mysterious emblem of\r\nSiva, the God of reproduction. Its roots are said to be in the centre\r\nof the earth, and to have been there since the creation. The Pandyan\r\nkings, when they were dying, were taken into the innermost sanctuary\r\nof Siva's temple, to expire and be united with their God. Parallel with\r\nthis holy of holies dedicated to the worship of Siva, in the form of\r\nhis mystic emblem, is the temple of his wife Parvati, here better known\r\nas Minakshi, or the fish-eyed.\r\n\r\nWe then went into the hall of the thousand pillars, which are carved\r\ninto the shape of gods or dancing-girls, and support a flat stone\r\nroof. Here some nautch-girls came dancing before us in silk trousers,\r\nlong tunics, golden headdresses, and rings on their ears, noses, and\r\ntoes; as we walked down the long vistas of pillars. Their motions are\r\nstiff and without grace, like the contortions of galvanized corpses,\r\nand they are generally very ugly, with black teeth. I was glad when\r\nthey relieved us of their disgusting presence, as we were shown into\r\na chamber near the outer door, where the horses and bulls used in the\r\ngreat processions are kept. These are made of solid silver, ornamented\r\nwith precious stones, and on festivals the God and Goddess are mounted\r\non them, and carried round the town.\r\n\r\nThis great pagoda is very richly endowed, and is one of the most famous\r\nin Southern India. It was originally, and for several centuries,\r\nthe centre of Tamil civilization, and it is a very characteristic\r\nspecimen of Hindu architecture. All originality and intellectual\r\nvigour has disappeared from amongst the Tamil people, under the\r\nblighting influence of foreign domination, but their devotional feeling\r\nappears to have survived; together with respect and veneration for\r\nthe doctrines and aphorisms of their classic sages, among the more\r\neducated. Aghastya stands at the head of the Tamil authors, and the\r\nfollowing confession of faith, in the _Njana-nuru_ is attributed to\r\nhim:--\r\n\r\n  \"Worship thou the light of the Universe, who is One:\r\n  Who made the world in a moment, and placed good men in it;\r\n  Who afterwards himself dawned upon the earth as a Guru;\r\n  Who, without wife or family, as a hermit performed austerities;\r\n  Who, appointing loving sages to succeed him,\r\n  Departed again into Heaven:--worship Him.\"[453]\r\n\r\nWe left the pagoda by a corridor leading through one of the _gopurams_\r\ninto the street, immediately in front of the great choultry erected\r\nby Tirumalla Naik. It consists of an immense hall of granite, 300\r\nfeet long by 80, supported by upwards of a hundred pillars of the\r\nsame stone, elaborately carved, and about thirty feet high. One of\r\nthem is formed of a single block of granite. Figures of the Madura\r\nkings of the Naik dynasty are carved on these pillars, amongst whom is\r\nTirumalla Naik, the founder of the edifice. One curious group of carved\r\nfigures represents a tradition of the old Pandyan times. It is related\r\nthat a rich farmer, living near Madura, had twelve sons, who passed\r\ntheir time in the chace. A wild hog once attacked them, killed some,\r\nand chased the rest to the vicinity of a sage engaged in meditation.\r\nThe angry ascetic cursed them, declaring that, in their future life,\r\nthey should be hogs themselves. They were born again as porkers, but\r\nMinakshi took pity on them, officiated as their nurse, and they became\r\nmen with pig's heads, in which capacity they are sculptured on one of\r\nthe pillars of the choultry. The pig-headed brethren were taught the\r\narts and sciences, and were eventually advanced to the ministerial\r\nadministration of the affairs of the Pandyan kingdom. The choultry\r\nwas originally built as a magnificent approach to the temple, and to\r\nreceive the image of the God Siva for ten days every year. It was\r\ncrowded with people, and the spaces between the pillars were occupied\r\nby traders selling silks and cotton-cloths, turbans, bags for betel,\r\nand trinkets.\r\n\r\nNext to the great pagoda and the choultry, the most interesting\r\narchitectural remains of the former grandeur of Madura are the ruins\r\nof the palace of Tirumalla Naik. They consist of a large quadrangular\r\ncourt, now roofless,[454] but apparently once covered over, with side\r\naisles supported by massive stone pillars, rendered almost double their\r\noriginal size by a thick coating of _chunam_, or lime made with pounded\r\nsea-shells, which takes a very fine polish, like marble. These columns\r\nare exceedingly handsome, and their capitals bear evidence of Italian\r\ndesign.[455] They are in double rows, and the roof of the aisles is\r\nmost elaborately carved with mythological figures, originally painted\r\nin bright colours. Numerous green paroquets were screaming and flying\r\nabout near the roof. At the end of this splendid court, opposite the\r\nstreet entrance, there is a broad flight of steps leading up to an\r\ninner hall, where columns of the same massive character support a\r\nrichly carved roof. The whole building has an exceedingly imposing\r\neffect, and in the sombre melancholy of its decay it gives a grand idea\r\nof the former civilization of the Tamil people; but as the English\r\nJudge now holds his court in a portion of the ruins, we must not say,\r\nwith the Persian poet,--\r\n\r\n  \"The spider now weaves its web in the palace of Cæsar,\r\n  The owl stands sentinel on the watch-tower of Afrasiab.\"\r\n\r\nTirumalla Naik also constructed a great tank, about a mile outside the\r\ntown, said to be the finest in Southern India. It is an exact square,\r\nwith sides 300 yards long faced with granite, and flights of steps down\r\nto the water, at intervals. In the centre there is a square island,\r\nrising in broad flights of steps from the water, and covered with a\r\ngrove of trees, above which rises the tall tower of a pagoda.\r\n\r\nThe town of Madura, situated on the banks of the river Vaigay, contains\r\nabout 50,000 inhabitants. It is by far the cleanest and best built city\r\nthat I saw in India, with fine broad streets, and houses with tiled\r\nroofs extending far beyond the walls, so as to form verandahs supported\r\nby poles. Here and there a house with an upper story, belonging to some\r\nwealthy citizen, rose above the rest; and in the bazars there was a\r\nstrong sickly smell of spices. Madura is indebted, for its superiority\r\nover other Indian towns, to Mr. Blackburn, a former Collector, and the\r\ninhabitants have erected a lamp on a tall pedestal to his memory.\r\n\r\nOn the day of my visit to the pagoda, the streets were densely crowded,\r\nthe women were decked out in all their finery, and those of the\r\nBrahmin caste had their faces hideously stained with saffron. It was\r\na festival in honour of some cow or other, who had been turned into a\r\nrock, through the excess of her love for _Nandi_, the bull on which\r\nthe God Siva rides. The religious feelings of the people are displayed\r\nin these festivals, and whether they worship and venerate the stone\r\nor wooden image, or the attributes of God-like virtue and wisdom\r\nwhich the emblems connected with the image are intended to represent,\r\nmy observations led me to believe that, in all classes, there was a\r\ndisplay of most undoubted sincerity. In connection with their religious\r\nobservances, the people of Southern India feel very strongly on the\r\nsubject of caste distinctions. The Brahmins are fair skinned, of Aryan\r\ndescent, and comparatively strangers, having been barely a thousand\r\nyears in the country.[456] Next come the _Sudras_, who represent the\r\nupper classes of the Tamil race. The _Vellaler_ or agricultural caste\r\ncomes next, and then the _Maravar_ and _Kallar_, or robber castes. The\r\nPrince of Ramnad, who is hereditary guardian of Rama's bridge, belongs\r\nto the Maravars, and the Rajah of Tondiman to the Kallars. Below the\r\nrobber castes are the _Shanars_ or toddy-drawers, who are free and\r\nproprietors of land; then the _Pariars_[457] and chucklers or slaves;\r\nthen the _Korawars_ or vagrant basket-makers, and last of all the\r\nshoemakers and low-caste washermen.\r\n\r\nThe higher castes had recently been outraged by the Shanars having\r\nbeen allowed to go in procession along the road, on the occasion of\r\na marriage at Arpucaté, a populous mercantile town in the Madura\r\ndistrict. This was done in defiance of all ancient customs and usages\r\nconnected with caste, which are clearly defined and acknowledged by\r\nall classes of Hindus. The high-caste people defend their feeling of\r\nexclusiveness by urging that the Shanars and Pariars are guilty of\r\none or other of the five great sins, namely, killing the sacred cow,\r\ntheft, drunkenness, adultery, and lying: for that the Shanars draw\r\ntoddy, and the Pariars eat meat. They claim for immemorial custom the\r\nsame authority that is given in England to common law, and declare\r\nthat the Shanars never had the right of parading the streets in\r\nprocession, with music and flags. In considering this question it\r\nshould not be forgotten that the Shanars and other low castes will no\r\nmore allow a man of still lower caste to overstep his privileges by one\r\nhair's breadth than will a Sudra or a Brahmin. Even the Pariars are a\r\nwell-defined, distinct, and ancient caste, jealous of the encroachments\r\nof the castes both above and below them: they have strong caste\r\nfeelings, and treat the caste of shoemakers with contempt.[458] Thus,\r\nif the Shanars and Pariars insist upon their own caste privileges, it\r\nis difficult to see why they should be permitted to infringe upon those\r\nof the castes above them; and it would seem that a feeling of content\r\nand satisfaction with our rule would be best promoted by ensuring to\r\nall classes of the community the exclusive enjoyment of their own\r\npeculiar usages and privileges.\r\n\r\nCaste is one among many instances of the peculiar exaggerations\r\nin which the Hindu mind loves to indulge. The social distinctions\r\nwhich prevail in other countries are represented in India by this\r\ninstitution, in which those distinctions are, not altogether\r\nillogically, carried to an extreme point. Caste may be modified\r\nand rendered less harsh in its general outline; but it will never\r\ncease to exist. The Protestant missionaries, of course, declare war\r\nto the knife against it, as a system of falsehood and deceit, and\r\nan absurdity contrary both to reason and revelation. This may be\r\ntrue, as well as that Brahmins get drunk, and eat asafœtida-cakes in\r\nwhich buffalo flesh forms an ingredient, without losing their caste;\r\nbut missionary denunciations of caste absurdity, and exposures of\r\nBrahminical irregularities, are not likely to make the slightest\r\nimpression on the minds of a people with whom caste distinctions are\r\nhallowed by immemorial usage, and bound up in every act of their lives.\r\nThe favourite missionary receipt is, therefore, to deprive Brahmins\r\nof their _Enam_ or rent-free lands, to induce Government entirely to\r\ndisavow caste, to put an end to all caste distinctions in jails, and\r\nto raise the Pariars and Chucklers from their degradation.[459] A very\r\nsummary plan no doubt, but as impracticable as it would be impolitic\r\nand unjust.\r\n\r\nAfter a most delightful visit at Madura, I started for Trichinopoly\r\nlate one night, and found the road so execrable in some places, that it\r\nwas necessary to go off into the fields, and make a long circuit. The\r\ncountry between Madura and Trichinopoly is chiefly cultivated with dry\r\ngrain, but there are occasional patches of rice. Ranges of rocky hills\r\nintersect the plain, covered with underwood and low trees, which the\r\nnatives are allowed to use for firewood, but, when they carry it off\r\nfor sale, in cart-loads, there is a small duty. I walked most of the\r\ndistance under the shade of the peepul and banyan-trees which line the\r\nroad, and reached Trichinopoly after a journey of a day and two nights.\r\n\r\nTrichinopoly is a large military station, and the European houses,\r\ntherefore, are very numerous, and occupy a considerable space, as they\r\nare generally surrounded by large parks or compounds. A bridge over a\r\nsmall tributary of the Cauvery leads to the bazar and native town; and\r\nthe view from the bridge is very pretty, with cocoanut-trees and bushes\r\ncoming down to the water's edge, and houses embosomed in trees, whence\r\nflights of steps lead down into the water. Beyond the bridge there is a\r\npicturesque mosque of white stone, and the bazar, a long street leading\r\nto the principal part of the town, in the centre of which the famous\r\nrock of Trichinopoly rises up abruptly. Brahmins and other traders\r\nwere sitting in their shops, before piles of earthenware and copper\r\nchatties, cotton cloths, and numerous kinds of grains and pulses in\r\nbaskets. The rock is a mass of granite, 400 feet high, crowned by a\r\nsmall Hindu temple; the ascent is cut in steps out of the solid rock,\r\nand from the summit there is a most extensive view, including the city,\r\nthe fine bridges over the Coleroon and Cauvery, the _gopurams_ of the\r\ngreat pagoda of Seringam on an island in the river, and a vast expanse\r\nof rice cultivation and palm-groves, with Tanjore on the distant\r\nhorizon. The native town contains several large handsome houses\r\nbelonging to Mohammedans, and the ruins of the palace of the Nawabs of\r\nthe Carnatic.\r\n\r\nThrough the kindness of Mr. McDonnell, the Collector, I was enabled to\r\npass a very interesting day at the Upper Coleroon _anicut_. Passing\r\nthe base of the rock of Trichinopoly, and following the main street\r\nof the native town, the banks of the river Cauvery are reached, where\r\nthere are rows of stone temples and houses with open corridors, whence\r\nflights of steps lead down into the water. Near the river there is a\r\ntank filled with red and white lotus-flowers. A handsome stone bridge\r\nspans the Cauvery, and another of equal length crosses the Coleroon,\r\nabout a mile further on. The two rivers form an island, and unite a few\r\nmiles lower down; and the upper _anicut_ is about fourteen miles up the\r\nriver, where Mr. McDonnell had a comfortable bungalow on the banks,\r\nshaded by lofty trees.\r\n\r\nThe Upper Coleroon _anicut_ or weir is constructed at the west end\r\nof the island of Seringam, which is formed by the separation of the\r\nCauvery into two branches, namely the Coleroon on the north, and the\r\nCauvery on the south. Formerly the bed of the Coleroon was continually\r\ndeepening, while that of the Cauvery was rising, so that there was much\r\ndifficulty in obtaining a sufficient supply of water for the irrigation\r\nof the rice-fields of Tanjore. The upper _anicut_, commenced by Colonel\r\nCotton in 1836, and finished in 1850, completely answered the purpose\r\nof deepening the bed of the Cauvery, so much so that another weir was\r\nmade across that river, sixty miles lower down; and by means of the\r\nsecond weir, made in 1845, and the under sluices in the upper one, the\r\nwater is now effectually kept under command.[460] The upper _anicut_,\r\nwhich I visited, is broken into three parts by two small islands. The\r\nsouth part is 282 yards long, the centre 350, and the north 122, the\r\nwhole length, including the islands, being 874, and without them 754\r\nyards. The weir is a plain brick wall, plastered with _chunam_, six\r\nfeet thick, and seven feet high, the top being lined with masonry. It\r\nis defended from the overfall by masses of rough stone; and there are\r\ntwenty-four sluices, which prevent accumulations of sand from forming\r\nabove the _anicut_. The sluices are connected by a narrow bridge of\r\nsixty-two arches, to secure access to them during floods, and it\r\nalso serves as a means of communication between the banks for foot\r\npassengers. The cost of the work, and of repairs between 1836 and 1850,\r\nwas two lacs of rupees, and it assists the irrigation of 600,000 acres,\r\nyielding a revenue of 400,000_l._, or equal to two-thirds of that of\r\nthe whole island of Ceylon.\r\n\r\nBy means of these _anicuts_ the fertile province of Tanjore is\r\nconverted into one vast rice-field,[461] and the portion of\r\nTrichinopoly below the upper weir is equally rich. The country to the\r\nnorth of the road between the _anicut_ and the town of Trichinopoly\r\nwas a wide expanse of bright green rice cultivation, stretching to the\r\nhorizon. In Southern India there are two annual crops of rice, called\r\nthe _caar_ and the _soombah_ or _peshanum_ crops. The former is reaped\r\nin October and is reckoned inferior, and the latter in February and\r\nMarch. Two crops in the year from the same land do not yield much more\r\nthan a single crop, but, owing to the liability of the seasons to fail,\r\nthe cultivators rear as much as possible for the first crop. This is\r\nreaped in the rainy season, when the straw cannot be preserved, so that\r\nthe second crop must necessarily be sown, for fodder for cattle. Rice\r\nrequires rain to ensure the full development of the grain, as well\r\nas irrigation. The seed is sown thick, and then transplanted to the\r\nfields about forty days afterwards; and the fields must be constantly\r\nsupplied with water. The stalks when cut are stacked for a few days,\r\nand the grain is then thrashed out by manual labour or cattle, the husk\r\nbeing separated from the grain with a rice-stamper, generally beaten by\r\nwomen. In the interval of sowing, the natives often sow the land with\r\npulse or sesame, the stubble of which is used as manure for the next\r\nrice-crop.\r\n\r\nAt intervals scattered over the plain, there are groves of cocoanut\r\nand palmyra-palms, like islands in the vast sea of rice-fields, with\r\nsmall villages built under their shade. As the betel-nut palm is the\r\nmost graceful in India, so the palmyra (_Borassus flabelliformis_) is\r\nundoubtedly the ugliest, with its black stem the same size all the way\r\nup, and coarse fan-shaped leaves. It is chiefly from this tree that the\r\nShanars draw the toddy. The spadix or young flowering branch is cut off\r\nnear the top, and an earthenware _chatty_ is tied on the stump, into\r\nwhich the juice flows. Every morning it is emptied and replaced, the\r\nstump being cut afresh, and so on until the whole is exhausted. Sugar\r\nis also extracted by the same process, the inside of the _chatty_ being\r\npowdered with lime to prevent fermentation, and the juice being boiled\r\ndown and dried. The sugar thus obtained is called _jaggery_. The timber\r\nof the palmyra-palm is extensively used for building.\r\n\r\nAs we drove towards Trichinopoly, with these rice-fields studded with\r\npalm-groves on our right, the tall towers of Seringam[462] appeared\r\nrising above the trees which border the waters of the Cauvery; and near\r\nthe town there are large plantain-groves. In leaving Trichinopoly on\r\nthe road to the Neilgherries it is necessary to cross a small affluent\r\nof the Cauvery in ferry-boats. Those for foot-passengers are of wicker\r\ncovered with hides, and perfectly round, like those which are described\r\nby Herodotus, and are still used on the Tigris and Euphrates. After\r\njolting all night through endless groves of banyan and peepul trees,\r\nI reached Caroor,[463] the ancient capital of the Chira Rajahs, the\r\nfollowing morning. The Chira state, in the days of its prosperity,\r\nextended over Coimbatore, and part of Mysore and Malabar. Caroor is\r\na town of some size, in the middle of a plain, through which flows\r\nthe river Amaravati, a tributary of the Cauvery. Mr. Roberts, the\r\nSub-Collector, was living in a curious upper story, on the top of a\r\npagoda, the entrance to which leads under a tall brick _gopuram_, 86\r\nfeet high, 64 feet long at the base, and 52 feet broad, sculptured with\r\nimages exactly on the pattern of those at Madura. The country between\r\nCaroor and the foot of the Neilgherries is flat and uninteresting,\r\nchiefly cultivated with _cholum_, _cumboo_, cotton, and a few pulses,\r\nwith rice in some places. The road is execrable, and generally lined\r\nwith banyan-trees, which, though affording pleasant shade, are ungainly\r\nand ugly, owing to the numerous bunches of dusty-looking roots, which\r\nhang in all directions from the branches. On arriving at Matepoliem\r\nI found a pony waiting, and, riding up the Coonoor ghaut, returned\r\nto Ootacamund. Half-way up the ghaut, at a place called Burlear, Mr.\r\nThomas, the Collector of Coimbatore, has a small but interesting\r\ngarden, containing all kinds of spices, cacao, coffee and tea plants,\r\nbesides oranges, lemons, and citrons.\r\n\r\nDuring my tour through the principal Tamil districts I was chiefly\r\nstruck with the evidences, furnished by the pagodas of Madura and\r\nSeringam, and the works of Tirumalla Naik, of the great surplus revenue\r\nwhich was once derived from the land. By the execution of additional\r\npublic works, the improvement of means of communication, and judicious\r\nreductions of the land-tax, which will induce the ryots to bring more\r\nwaste land under cultivation, much has been effected, but much still\r\nremains to be done, before the country attains the same degree of\r\nprosperity which it appears to have enjoyed in the best days of the\r\nPandyan and Naik dynasties. Tanjore has probably already reached the\r\nhighest state of profitable rice cultivation, through the irrigation\r\nsupplied by the Coleroon _anicuts_. But much may yet be done with\r\nregard to the encouragement of the growth of cotton in Coimbatore,\r\nMadura, and Tinnevelly; and hereafter the coffee and chinchona\r\nplantations of the Neilgherry hills, the Pulneys, and the Anamallays\r\nwill supply another important source of wealth and prosperity.\r\n\r\nTo the north of the Cauvery, in the district of Salem, there is a\r\nrange of isolated hills, called the Shervaroys, which rise, a few\r\nmiles north-east of the town of Salem, into a mass of densely wooded\r\nflat-topped hills. The mean height of the table-land of the Shervaroys,\r\non their summits, is 4600 feet, and the highest peak rises to 5260\r\nfeet. In the Salem district the south-west monsoon sets in early in\r\nJune, and showers continue till September; and in the end of October\r\nthe north-east monsoon brings a return of rain from the opposite\r\nquarter, which continues until December, when the rains cease, owing\r\nto the change of wind from north-east to due north. There are several\r\ncoffee estates on the Shervaroy hills, but they are considered to\r\nbe too dry, and, although the coffee produced is said to be of\r\nexcellent quality, yet the yield is small, and I was told that the\r\nShervaroy plantations were generally losing concerns. The land-tax on\r\nthese estates is one rupee an acre. Between December and June it is\r\nexceedingly dry, and I, therefore, did not consider it advisable to try\r\nthe experiment of chinchona cultivation on the Shervaroys during the\r\nfirst or second years. If the plants are hereafter found to be capable\r\nof enduring longer droughts than we at present expect, they may then be\r\ntried on the Shervaroys.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason I gave up all idea of the hills near Courtallum,\r\nin Tinnevelly. At Courtallum, notwithstanding the perennial humidity,\r\nthe rainfall is only 40 inches, though on the surrounding hills it\r\nis probably greater.[464] The elevation of those hills, however, is\r\nnot sufficient for the profitable cultivation of most species of\r\nchinchona-plants. Tinnevelly is sheltered from the south-west monsoon\r\nby the Travancore mountains, and from the north-east monsoon by the\r\nSerumullay hills, 3500 feet high, which rise from the Madura plains\r\nnear Dindigul, and by the island of Ceylon to the east. This extreme\r\nsouth part of the peninsula, between latitude 8° and 10° north,\r\ntherefore receives little moisture, and has a hot arid climate,\r\nresembling Egypt, and producing senna and Indian cotton of the best\r\nquality.[465] It is possible, however, that localities may hereafter\r\nbe found, where the chinchona species suited to comparatively low\r\nelevations might flourish, such as _C. succirubra_ and _C. micrantha_,\r\non the mountains dividing Tinnevelly from Travancore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nMYSORE AND COORG.\r\n\r\n  Seegoor ghaut--Sandal-wood--Mysore--Seringapatam--Hoonsoor--The\r\n  tannery--Fraserpett--Mercara--The fort--The Rajahs of Coorg--The\r\n  Coorgs--Origin of the river Cauvery--Coorg--Climate--Coffee\r\n  cultivation--Sites for chinchona-plantations--Caryota\r\n  Urens--Virarajendrapett--Cardamom cultivation--Kumari--Poon,\r\n  blackwood, and teak--Pepper cultivation in\r\n  Malabar--Cannanore--Nuggur and Baba Bodeen hills--The Beebee of\r\n  Cannanore--Compta--Sedashighur--Arrive at Bombay.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE descent from the plateau of the Neilgherries to the plains of\r\nMysore on the north, is by the Seegoor ghaut, the only one which is\r\npracticable for carriages. It is much tamer, and not to be compared\r\nwith those of Sispara or Coonoor; and at the foot there is a wide belt\r\nof thin, stunted, pestiferous jungle, twenty-five miles in breadth,\r\nthrough which the river Moyaar flows to join the Bowany. There are a\r\ngreat many young teak-trees, and sandal-wood is also found, in the\r\nforests on the inner or eastern slopes of the ghauts; but all the\r\ntimber looked poor and stunted.[466] The sandal-wood tree (_Santalum\r\nalbum_) is about twenty feet high, with numerous spreading branches,\r\nand small purplish flowers. Dr. Cleghorn reports that with vigilant\r\nsupervision, and slight assistance to nature in clearing the heads of\r\nyoung plants, which are often matted down by creepers, an addition\r\nmight accrue to the revenue of several districts in the Madras\r\nPresidency by the sale of sandal-wood. The export trade in sandal-wood\r\nand oil is even now very considerable. The road from the foot of the\r\nSeegoor ghaut to Mysore, a distance of sixty-four miles, is excellent,\r\nand there is a very good bridge over the river Moyaar. We passed the\r\nnight at the half-way bungalow of Goondulpett, whence there is a grand\r\nview, with scattered date-palms in the foreground, a vast expanse of\r\nundulating plain beyond, bounded by the belt of forest, with the blue\r\nline of the Neilgherries in the distance. There is nothing of interest\r\nbetween Goondulpett and Mysore.\r\n\r\nMysore is on a table-land 2450 feet above the sea. On the western\r\nside of the town flows the Purneah canal, which comes from a distance\r\nof seventy miles to supply Mysore with water, and was made by the\r\nBrahmin minister Purneah, who came into power during the present\r\nRajah's minority, after the death of Tippoo. In approaching the town,\r\nthe isolated rocky hill of Chamandi is seen on the right. Mysore is\r\nfortified, and, after passing under the ramparts, we entered a square,\r\none side of which is occupied by the Rajah's palace. Here, and in the\r\nadjoining streets, there was an unusual amount of life and bustle owing\r\nto the presence of a native court; and we met crowds of nautch-girls,\r\nmen in various costumes, elephants, camels, and bullock-carts. Some of\r\nthe houses have upper stories, but the majority are dark places, with\r\nred-tiled roofs extending far over, and forming verandahs.\r\n\r\nMysore is so called from its having been the abode of the\r\nbuffalo-headed demon _Mahesh-asur_, who was slain by Parvati, the\r\nwife of Siva, in her most hideous and repulsive form, as Cali, the\r\nimpersonation of vengeance. The country, from 1336 to 1565, formed a\r\npart of the Brahminical kingdom of Bijayanuggur; and in 1576 one Raj\r\nWadeyar established his independence as ruler of Mysore, from whom the\r\npresent Rajah is descended. After the death of Tippoo Sultan, and the\r\ncapture of Seringapatam by the English in 1799, the present Rajah, then\r\nonly five years old, was placed on the throne, and the country was\r\nruled by his very clever minister Purneah, until he came of age. He\r\nafterwards proved so utterly incompetent to govern, that the country\r\nfell into a state of anarchy, and the English therefore undertook\r\nthe administration in 1832. The Mysore Commission was then formed,\r\nwith Sir Mark Cubbon at its head, and Mysore was divided into four\r\ndivisions--Bangalore, Astagram, Nuggur, and Chitteldroog.\r\n\r\nThe table-land of Mysore covers an area of 30,886 square miles,\r\nand contains a population of 3,300,000 souls. Sir Mark Cubbon's\r\nadministration was vigorous and progressive. In 1832 the revenue\r\nwas 440,000_l._, in 1860-61 it was 950,000_l._, and in the latter\r\nyear there was an excess of income over expenditure, amounting to\r\n120,000_l._ The Chief Commissioner has made upwards of 1600 miles of\r\nexcellent carriage-road, bridged throughout, and has introduced many\r\nimportant measures, while the officers who have worked under him have\r\ngenerally been distinguished for ability and zeal. The good old general\r\nwas sixty years in India, and governed Mysore from 1832 to 1861. He was\r\nadored by all ranks of the people, and his resignation caused universal\r\nregret, when, early in 1861, he sailed for England. But he was not\r\ndestined to see his native land again, he died at Suez, and thus passed\r\naway a brave soldier and an enlightened statesman, one who had done as\r\ngood and valuable service to his country as any English public servant\r\nduring the present century.\r\n\r\nDuring our stay at Mysore we drove over to Seringapatam, a distance of\r\ntwelve miles. The immediate neighbourhood of the capital is chiefly\r\nplanted with dry grains, such as raggee and pulses. The common people\r\nlive chiefly on raggee, which they store in underground pits. They\r\nalso use the seeds of gram (_Cicer arietinum_) in curries and cakes,\r\nand the oxalic acid which exudes from every part of the plant serves\r\ninstead of vinegar for their curries. The roads round Mysore are\r\nlined with hedges of American aloe. After the first few miles, we\r\nbegan to pass through groves of cocoanut and betel-palms,[467] much\r\nrice cultivation, and fields of sugar-cane. Close to Seringapatam\r\na sugar manufactory has been established by Mr. Grove, who buys up\r\nthe _jaggery_ from the ryots and refines it. We crossed the Cauvery\r\nby a fine bridge, and saw the great canal constructed by Tippoo for\r\nirrigating the rice-fields. There are large ruinous houses and temples,\r\nembowered in palm-trees, with flights of steps down to the river,\r\noutside the old town itself, which is surrounded by a wall and ditch.\r\n\r\nWe first drove to the tomb under which Hyder Ali and Tippoo are buried.\r\nIt is in the middle of a garden called the _Lal-bagh_, with a pretty\r\navenue of cocoanut and betel-palms leading up to it. The tomb is a\r\nsquare building, surmounted by a dome, with minarets at the angles,\r\nrichly decorated with arabesque-work in _chunam_. It is surrounded by\r\nan open corridor, supported by pillars of black hornblende, and in\r\nthe centre of each side there is a doorway. That facing the avenue is\r\nfilled in with an open-work screen of the same stone, and the others\r\nhave double doors richly inlaid with ivory, the gift of Lord Dalhousie.\r\nThe tombs are placed under the dome, three in number, namely, of Hyder,\r\nTippoo, and Tippoo's mother, each covered over with a pall of crimson\r\nsilk. The building is surrounded by cloisters, a part being used as a\r\nchoultry for Moslem travellers, another as a mosque, and another as a\r\nschool for small boys who learn to read the Koran. Government grants an\r\nallowance for keeping the place in repair, and paying Moulvies to serve\r\nin the mosque. The effect of the snow-white tomb, richly adorned with\r\narabesque-work, the lance-like minarets, the cloudless sky, and the\r\nfeathery palm-trees rearing their graceful heads round the building,\r\nwas exceedingly like a scene in the Arabian Nights. The tomb of Colonel\r\nBaillie, who was taken prisoner by Hyder Ali in 1780, is close by, but\r\nin a very neglected state.\r\n\r\nWe then went to the _Derya Dowlet-bagh_ close to the town, which was\r\nthe favourite summer-palace of Tippoo. It is a very richly ornamented\r\narabesque building, every part being covered with gilding and bright\r\ncolours, and pictures on the walls representing the repulse of Lally,\r\nand the defeat of Colonel Baillie. From this place we went to the town\r\nof Seringapatam itself, which is built on an island in the Cauvery,\r\nand surrounded by a strong wall and two very deep ditches. Close to\r\nthe gate is the _jumma musjid_, or principal mosque, with two tall\r\nminarets; and, in one corner, the spot was pointed out where Tippoo\r\nwas accustomed to pray, entering the mosque by a small side-door. The\r\ndouble ditch is a very formidable defence to the town, but it does\r\nnot extend along the side facing the river, and it was here that the\r\nassault was delivered by the English general. A feint was made in the\r\ndirection of the _Lal-bagh_, where the English suffered severely, while\r\nthe real storming party was formed on the opposite side of the Cauvery,\r\nat a spot which is now marked by two upright posts. A bastion facing\r\nthe river had previously been breached, the four guns on it dismounted,\r\nand scarcely any other guns could be brought to bear on the soldiers\r\nof the assaulting column at this particular point, who dashed across\r\nthe Cauvery and up the breach. Tippoo was jammed by the flying crowd in\r\na small doorway, which we saw, where he was killed, and from that day\r\nthe pestiferous Seringapatam ceased to be the capital of Mysore. The\r\npalace, now in ruins, is very like that of the Nawab of the Carnatic\r\nat Trichinopoly, a plain rambling building with rows of large windows,\r\nand there are extensive gardens round it, full of tamarind-trees,\r\ncocoanuts, plantains, and vines.\r\n\r\nThe old town of Seringapatam is exceedingly interesting, but it now\r\nwears an appearance of silent decay and desolation. It is notoriously\r\nunhealthy, and the inevitable penalty of a night passed in the town is\r\na severe attack of fever.\r\n\r\nFrom Mysore we took our way, by Hoonsoor, to the hill district of\r\nCoorg. The road to Hoonsoor passes over twenty-eight miles of a country\r\nvery little cultivated, with extensive tracts of waste land, and a few\r\nfields of dry grain near the villages. Hoonsoor has for many years\r\nbeen a Government grazing-farm and manufactory. In 1860 the bullocks\r\nwere all sold off, but there are still thirty-eight fine elephants,\r\nand upwards of a hundred camels. We saw the elephants having their\r\nbreakfasts in a solemn motionless row, large heaps of rice wrapped in\r\nbundles of reed being put into their mouths by the mahouts. Besides an\r\nestablishment of blacksmiths, carpenters, brass-workers, and of women\r\nemployed in making blankets, there is an extensive Government tannery\r\nat Hoonsoor. There are many trees in India well adapted for tanning\r\npurposes, but the American sumach (_Cæsalpinia coriaria_) introduced\r\nby Dr. Wallich in 1842, and called by the natives _divi-divi_, appears\r\nto be considered the best at Hoonsoor. The _kino_-tree (_Pterocarpus\r\nmarsupium_) is another, and there are two kinds of _catechu_ used for\r\ntanning, one from the betel-nut-palm, and the other from an acacia.\r\nTo obtain the _catechu_ from the betel-palm the nuts are boiled,\r\nand the remaining water is inspissated, and yields the best kind,\r\nwhich is used for the golden coffee-brown colour in dyeing calico,\r\nas well as for tanning. From the acacia the _catechu_ is obtained by\r\nboiling the unripe pods and old wood. It is not considered so good as\r\n_kino_ or _divi-divi_ for tanning purposes, on account of its extreme\r\nastringency. The tannery at Hoonsoor is a very extensive establishment,\r\nwhere shoes, sandals, crossbelts, and scabbards are made for the army.\r\n\r\nThis place suffers frequently and most severely from cholera; and,\r\nduring these terrible visitations a _Swami_ or God, in the shape of\r\na small stone image of Ganesa seated under a black-wood tree, is\r\nspecially invoked.\r\n\r\nHoonsoor is 25 miles from Fraserpett, at the foot of the Coorg\r\nmountains, and we passed through extensive groves of palm-trees with\r\nchatties fastened round the spadices to catch the toddy. Fraserpett is\r\nwithin the Coorg district, and it is in the pleasant little bungalows\r\nwhich have been built here, that the English take refuge during the\r\nheavy down-pour of the south-west monsoon. Through the kindness of\r\nCaptain Martin, a former Superintendent of Coorg, and now engaged\r\nin the cultivation of coffee, we found horses waiting for us at\r\nFraserpett, and continued our journey to Mercara, the capital of the\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nAfter the first two miles the road enters a dense bamboo jungle,\r\nextending along the base of the mountains. It was the month of January\r\nand the forest was completely dried up and burnt by the sun and want\r\nof rain, looking brown and sombre. A splendid white _Ipomæa_, with a\r\nrich lilac centre, was creeping in festoons to the very top of the\r\nfeathery bamboos which bent gracefully over the road. At a place called\r\nSoonticoopah, ten miles from Fraserpett, the ascent of the mountains\r\nbegins. The road leads up and down a succession of wooded heights,\r\nwhich gradually increase in elevation, with intermediate valleys\r\ncultivated with rice and generally fringed with plantain-groves,\r\nthrough which the huts of the Coorgs are visible. At the heads of\r\nthese valleys the streams are divided into two channels, and led down\r\neach side, the space between being sown with rice in terraced fields,\r\ngradually descending with the slope of the valley. These bright\r\npatches of cultivation are very pretty, with their light vivid green\r\ncontrasting with the sombre hues of the forest. Near Mercara the jungle\r\nis a good deal cleared, and the slopes are covered with coffee-plants.\r\nThe road is excellent.\r\n\r\nTowards evening we came in sight of Mercara, by far the prettiest place\r\nI have seen in India. On the opposite side of a deep narrow valley was\r\nthe fort and palace, built on an eminence overlooking a vast extent\r\nof mountainous, forest-covered country. The palace is surrounded by\r\na fortified wall of dark-coloured stone, with semicircular bastions\r\nat intervals. On the wall facing us were two square buildings, with\r\na row of long windows, and an overhanging roof, the residence of\r\nCaptain Eliott, the Superintendent of Coorg; and behind rose up the\r\nlong edifice forming the old palace, and the white steeple of a modern\r\nchurch. A range of wooded hills, with heavy clouds hanging over them,\r\nformed the background. To the right, at a lower elevation were the\r\nnative town, and two mosque-like buildings, snowy white, with domes,\r\nand minarets at the angles, rising up amongst a grove of trees. These\r\nare the tombs of the former Rajahs. The narrow gorge below the fort\r\nis planted with coffee and plantains, which almost hide the huts that\r\nnestle amongst them. In the bottom of the ravine is the principal\r\npagoda of Mercara, built like a mosque, with the tops of the minarets\r\nrichly gilded. The entrance to the fort is by a steep ascent, leading\r\nunder a deep gateway in the outer line of fortification, into a\r\ncourtyard. A second archway leads into a second small court, where\r\nthere is an elaborately carved pagoda to Ganesa. A third archway opens\r\nupon the principal courtyard of the fort, one side of which is occupied\r\nby the Rajah's palace, a long barrack-looking building, with an upper\r\nstory and projecting tiled roof. The officers of a native regiment are\r\nquartered in the palace. To the left is the English church, and to the\r\nright there is a dark dungeon under the rampart, where the late Rajah\r\nkept his prisoners. He used to allow one at a time to run out, and try\r\nto escape by the archway, while he picked them off with a rifle from a\r\nwindow of the palace as they ran. There are two full-sized models of\r\nfavourite elephants, built of brick and _chunam_, in the courtyard.\r\nThe huts of the native regiment are clustered in a little valley close\r\nunder the south wall of the fort.\r\n\r\nThe palace is entered by an archway, over which there is a balconied\r\nwindow supported by two white horses. The inner court is surrounded by\r\na corridor of stone pillars, with a roof entirely of copper; and in the\r\ncentre of the court there is a tank paved with stone flags, now dry,\r\nwith five steps down to it, on two sides, and a carved stone tortoise\r\nin the centre.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the small valley filled with soldiers' huts, there\r\nis a parade-ground, and a small amphitheatre dug out of the solid rock,\r\nwhere elephants and tigers fought for the diversion of the Rajah.\r\nBeyond the parade-ground the ridge on which Mercara is built abruptly\r\nterminates, and the land sinks down into a wooded valley. Here the\r\nlate Rajah had built a little brick and _chunam_ summer-house, whence\r\nthe land descends precipitously to the road leading down the Mangalore\r\nghaut. From this point there is one of the most glorious views to be\r\nfound in India, and we could sit on the grassy edge of the cliffs for\r\nhours, without ceasing to enjoy it. Right and left there is a wide\r\nexpanse of forest-covered ranges of mountains extending into the\r\nblue distance, and in front rises up the mountain of Tadiandamol, the\r\nloftiest peak in Coorg. We watched the crimson sunset over the hills,\r\nand after dark a spontaneous ignition of the dry grass wound like a\r\nserpent along the loftier ridges of the opposite mountains, producing\r\nan indescribably beautiful effect in the clear starry night.\r\n\r\nCoorg has been a portion of the British dominions since 1834, when\r\nthe last Rajah was deposed. The old Rajahs were not Coorgs, but Hindu\r\nLingayets, a peculiar sect whose members wear a small god round their\r\nnecks, in a little silver coffer.[468] The family had certainly reigned\r\nin Coorg since 1633; and Dodda Virappa, who died in 1734, fixed the\r\nseat of government at Mercara, and was the greatest prince of his\r\nfamily. He repulsed a simultaneous invasion of the Mysore Rajah and the\r\nNairs of Malabar, and afterwards reigned in peace for eighteen years.\r\nHyder Ali invaded and overran the country several times, but in 1788\r\nthe young Rajah Viraraja rallied the people round him, disputed every\r\ninch of ground against Tippoo's invading army, and made an alliance\r\nwith the English in Malabar. On the fall of Tippoo a treaty was signed\r\nbetween the East India Company and Viraraja of Coorg, who died in\r\n1807, leaving the country to his favourite daughter Devammaji. His\r\nbrother Lingaraja, however, usurped the throne. He was a monster of\r\ncruelty, and, dying in 1820, was succeeded by his still more brutal\r\nson Viraraja, who massacred all his father's friends, together with\r\nthe poor young princess Devammaji. Her sister, who had married a\r\nCoorg, escaped into British territory. It would be too revolting to\r\nrecount all the atrocities of the last Rajah of Coorg; but at length\r\nthe patience of Lord William Bentinck was exhausted, and in April\r\n1834 General Fraser entered Mercara, and deposed him. Coorg has since\r\nbeen governed by an English Superintendent, under the orders of the\r\nCommissioners of Mysore.\r\n\r\nThe Kodagas or Coorgs are a tall, muscular, broad-chested,\r\nwell-favoured race of mountaineers, numbering about 25,000, with a\r\npopulation rapidly increasing since the deposition of the Rajah.[469]\r\nThey are of Dravidian origin, and speak a dialect of Canarese; but a\r\ncolony of Brahmins early settled in the country, and endeavoured to\r\nmould the traditions of the Coorgs into harmony with their own legends.\r\nThese are embodied in the Cauvery Purana, where there is a romantic\r\naccount of the origin of that important river, which rises in the\r\nmountains of Coorg.\r\n\r\nIn the Mahabharata it is related that the _amrit_ or drink of\r\nimmortality, which had been lost in the waters of the Deluge, was\r\nrecovered by the Suras and Asuras, gods and demons, by churning the\r\nocean. The Asuras are then said to have stolen it, and it was finally\r\nrestored to the gods by the maiden Lopamudre, who charmed the Asuras by\r\nher beauty. The fair damsel then resolved to become a river, and thus\r\npour herself out in blessings over the earth. But the sage Aghastya,\r\nso famous in the history of Madura, was enamoured of her, and she at\r\nlength so far yielded as to consent to be his wife, on condition that\r\nshe should be at liberty to forsake him the first time he left her\r\nalone. One day he went to a short distance to bathe, when Lopamudre\r\nimmediately gratified her early longings, by jumping into Aghastya's\r\nholy tank, and flowing forth as the river Cauvery. The sage, on his\r\nreturn, ran after her, but the only consolation that was left to him\r\nwas to explain to his beloved the course she ought to take in flowing\r\ntowards the eastern sea.\r\n\r\nThe Cauvery Brahmins, as persons of that caste are called in Coorg,\r\nwear the sacred thread, and perform _poojah_ to Amma, the goddess\r\nof the river. They number about forty families, but are fast dying\r\nout. They are often very rich, and are employed in the pagoda, or as\r\nclerks in the Superintendent's office. The Coorgs themselves, the\r\ninhabitants of this mountainous district, are divided into thirteen\r\ncastes.[470] They generally retain the old devil-worship of the Scythic\r\nor Dravidian race from which they are descended, and are addicted to\r\nthe use of charms and sorceries. They marry at a ripe age, but the\r\nwives of brothers are considered as common property. All the men wear a\r\nsilver-mounted dagger, secured round the waist by a silver chain; and\r\nthe women, who are often very pretty, wear a white cotton cloth round\r\nthe head, with the ends hanging half-way down the back. The men are an\r\nindependent, hard-working race, tall, with comparatively fair skins.\r\nThey are very keen sportsmen, and most of them possess a gun, the boys\r\npractising with pellet-bows.\r\n\r\nCoorg consists of a succession of lofty wooded ridges and long deep\r\nvalleys, forty miles broad by sixty long, between lat. 12° and 13°\r\nN. It is bounded on the north by the river Hemavati, on the south by\r\nthe Tambacheri pass, on the west by Malabar and South Canara, and on\r\nthe east by Mysore. South of Mercara the country appears covered with\r\nforest, wave upon wave of wooded mountain ranges rising one behind\r\nthe other, the highest peak of all having its summit partially bare of\r\ntrees, and covered with rich herbage. The elevations above the sea are\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n  Tadiandamol (the highest peak)      5781 feet\r\n  Pushpagiri (another peak)           5682\r\n  Mercara                             4506\r\n  Virarajendrapett                    3399\r\n  Fraserpett                          3200\r\n\r\nThe river Cauvery drains about four-fifths of the surface of Coorg,\r\nwhile about a dozen streams, issuing from the same hill region,\r\ntraverse Malabar and South Canara. From the end of December to the end\r\nof March rain is very scarce, but the valleys are seldom without fogs\r\nmore or less dense in the evenings and mornings, and heavy dews are\r\nfrequent. During these months a dry east wind prevails, which has long\r\nceased to carry rain with it from the Bay of Bengal. Towards the end\r\nof March clouds begin to collect, and the air grows moister. In April\r\nand May there are thunderstorms and frequent showers, with a warm and\r\nmoist climate. In the end of May the clouds in the western sky grow in\r\nstrength; and in June rain prevails, descending at times softly, but\r\ngenerally with great violence, accompanied by heavy gusts of westerly\r\nwind. In July and August the rain pours down in floods day and night,\r\nto such a degree that a flat country would be deluged, but Coorg, after\r\nbeing thoroughly bathed, sends off the water to the east and west by\r\nher numerous valleys. The yearly fall of rain often exceeds 160 inches.\r\nIn September the sun breaks through, in October a north-east wind\r\nclears the sky, in November showers fall over Coorg, being the tail of\r\nthe north-east monsoon, and December is often foggy.[471] The following\r\ntable will give an idea of the annual temperature of Mercara,[472] the\r\nextremes ranging from 52° to 82°, and the average being 60°:--\r\n\r\n  ---+-------------------------------------------------------+---\r\n     |                                                       |\r\n     |            MERCARA, THE CAPITAL OF COORG,             |\r\n     |                                                       |\r\n     |                      1836-37.                         |\r\n     |                                                       |\r\n     +-----------+-------------------+-- -------+------------+\r\n     |           |      Mean         |          |            |\r\n     |           |   Temperature.    | Rainfall | Prevailing |\r\n     |   MONTH.  |-------------------|   in     |   Wind.    |\r\n     |           |  6 A.M. | 10 A.M. | Inches.  |            |\r\n     +-----------+---------+---------+----------+------------+\r\n     | January   |   56    |   69    |  None.   | N.E.       |\r\n     |           |         |         |          |            |\r\n     | February  |   60    |   74    |  None.   | E.N.E.     |\r\n     |           |         |         |          |            |\r\n     | March     |   64    |   76    |   1.3    | Variable.  |\r\n     |           |         |         |          |            |\r\n     | April     |   65    |   78    |   0.2    | Variable.  |\r\n     |           |         |         |          |            |\r\n     | May       |   63    |   72    |   7.6    | N.W.       |\r\n     |           |         |         |          |            |\r\n     | June      |   62    |   68    |  20.8    | W.N.W.     |\r\n     |           |         |         |          |            |\r\n     | July      |   62    |   64    |  23.7    | W.N.W.     |\r\n     |           |         |         |          |            |\r\n     | August    |   60    |   63    |  24.7    | W.N.W.     |\r\n     |           |         |         |          |            |\r\n     | September |   62    |   67    |   7      | W.N.W.     |\r\n     |           |         |         |          |            |\r\n     | October   |   63    |   68    |   0.5    | W.N.W.     |\r\n     |           |         |         |          |            |\r\n     | November  |   60    |   70    |   1.5    | E.N.E.     |\r\n     |           |         |         |          |            |\r\n     | December  |   58    |   70    |   0.07   | N.E.       |\r\n  ---+-----------+---------+---------+----------+------------+---\r\n\r\nAn immense quantity of rice is cultivated in the Coorg valleys, and\r\nlargely exported, but scarcely any dry grain is raised. In 1853 the\r\nrice harvest was said to have been worth seven lacs of rupees. The\r\nCoorgs pay so much on the seed sown, as a land-tax, besides a small\r\nhouse-tax, and the cardamom sales yield about 35,000 Rs.[473]\r\n\r\nCoffee cultivation was only commenced in Coorg about six years ago,\r\nbut its extension both amongst natives and Europeans has since been\r\nvery remarkable. There are now more than a dozen plantations owned by\r\nEuropeans, chiefly near the road leading down the ghaut from Mercara\r\nto the port of Mangalore, and several thousand acres are already under\r\ncultivation. Mr. Mann, the largest proprietor, has upwards of 800 acres\r\nplanted with coffee-trees. The natives too have shown great enterprise\r\nin undertaking a cultivation previously unknown to them, and there is\r\nnow scarcely a hut to be seen without its little coffee-garden. All\r\nthe plantations on the eastern side of Mercara, excepting one, belong\r\nto natives; and close to the town I observed a small clearing where a\r\nCoorg was hard at work building himself a hut, cutting away the jungle,\r\nleading a small stream into new channels for purposes of irrigation,\r\nand planting the slopes of two hills with coffee.\r\n\r\nAn export duty of four annas the maund is levied on coffee in Coorg,\r\nwhich, in 1861, brought in a revenue of 23,000 Rs. In that year\r\n1,29,869 maunds were exported, 1,17,223 by native growers, and 12,645\r\nby Europeans. This disproportion will not exist this year, as the\r\nplants on several new estates will now be in bearing for the first\r\ntime. The main roads in Coorg are excellent, and one at least of the\r\nplanters, if not more, has displayed great energy in connecting his\r\nestates by good roads with the main Government highways. Most of the\r\navailable land, within reasonable distance of a highway, is already\r\ntaken up for coffee cultivation. Labour, as is also the case in Wynaad\r\nand the Neilgherries, is chiefly procured from Mysore, the coolies\r\ncoming up after their own work is done.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by the account I have been able to give of the\r\nelevation, temperature, and of the periods of drought and moisture\r\nin this hill district, that it is not nearly so well adapted for\r\nthe cultivation of chinchona-plants as Neddiwuttum, and many other\r\nlocalities on the Neilgherry hills. It may be compared, more\r\nappropriately, with the forests near Sispara on the Koondahs, as it is\r\nexposed to the full force of the south-west monsoon, and suffers from a\r\nlong drought during the winter.\r\n\r\nThe country to the north and east of Mercara is a plateau, about 4500\r\nfeet above the sea, intersected by ravines full of trees and underwood,\r\namongst which I observed wild orange and lime-trees, _Michelias_, and\r\ntree-ferns, with an undergrowth of ferns, _Lobelia_, _Ipomæa_, and\r\n_Solanum_. The scenery is charming, with grassy slopes, wooded glades,\r\nand here and there a secluded hut in a grove of plantains, on the\r\nedge of a small patch of rice cultivation. I also examined some of\r\nthe forests down the Mangalore ghaut. The road is excellent, winding\r\nwith a gentle gradient through the beautiful forest scenery past\r\nnumerous coffee-plantations to their port of shipment at Mangalore.\r\nAt the fourth milestone from Mercara there is a forest extending for\r\nnearly a mile, on the left of the road, at an elevation of 3800 feet\r\nabove the sea. It descends from the road to the bottom of the ravine,\r\nand on the opposite side there are forest-covered heights of greater\r\nelevation. The forest contains many tall trees, not growing very\r\nclose, with tree-ferns, _Cinnamomum_, _Hymenodictyon_, _Melastomaceæ_,\r\na _Papilionacea_ with a bright yellow flower, and ferns, of which I\r\ncollected five kinds. The general character of the flora appeared\r\nsuitable for the growth of chinchona-plants; and, though this was the\r\ndriest time of the year, I found at least one small stream trickling\r\ndown through the underwood. The valley runs north-west and south-east.\r\n\r\nIn this locality plants of _C. succirubra_ would no doubt flourish,\r\nand the experiment ought certainly to be tried; though, from the low\r\nelevation, the bark would probably be thin, and would yield perhaps\r\na small per-centage of alkaloids. These points, however, can only be\r\nascertained by experience gained from experimental culture. I was told\r\nby Captain Eliott, the Superintendent of Coorg, that the forest in\r\nquestion has been applied for and refused to several coffee-planters.\r\nThe land belongs to Government, but there is a devil living on it,\r\nto which the Coorgs do _poojah_, and the Commissioner of Mysore has,\r\ntherefore, been hitherto unwilling to allow it to be occupied.\r\n\r\nThere are many other localities equally suited for the cultivation\r\nof _C. succirubra_ and _C. micrantha_ in Coorg; the Government will\r\nshortly establish a chinchona nursery there; and, with so many\r\nenergetic and intelligent planters in the district, it will be strange\r\nif the growth of this important product is not extended and rendered\r\nprofitable by private enterprise. A few rows of chinchona-plants ought\r\nto be established in the loftiest part of each coffee-clearing; and\r\nevery settler should plant them, and encourage the cultivation among\r\nthe natives, from motives of humanity, as well as with a view to\r\nsuccessful commercial speculation.\r\n\r\nWe finally left Mercara before dawn, and rode for three miles down\r\nthe steep ghaut leading to the lower and more extensive valleys of\r\nsouth-eastern Coorg, which we reached as the sun rose. It was a very\r\npleasant ride through the beautiful hill country, with uplands covered\r\nwith fine forest, and long strips of fertile valley. In the jungles we\r\nsaw immense clumps of bamboo, which overshadowed the road; a leafless\r\nand thorny _Erythrina_ with crimson flowers; and a _Solanum_ with a\r\nsmall white flower by the road-side. Here and there we came to open\r\ngrassy glades, whence little footpaths led through the neighbouring\r\njungle to some secluded hut. The cultivated valleys are covered with\r\nrice, and fringed with plantain groves and _Caryota urens_.\r\n\r\nThe _Caryota urens_ is a lofty palm-tree, with large leaves, and the\r\nCoorgs draw an immense quantity of toddy from it during the hot season.\r\nThe pith of the trunk of old trees is a kind of sago, and is made\r\ninto bread and gruel by the natives of many parts of India. Humboldt\r\nsays that the form of the leaves is very singular, the singularity\r\nconsisting in their being bipinnatisect, with the ultimate division\r\nhaving the shape of the fin and tail of a fish.[474]\r\n\r\nWe passed several hundred pack-bullocks conveying Bombay salt from\r\nthe Malabar ports to the interior, and, having forded the Cauvery at\r\na point where the bed is full of large boulders of rock, reached the\r\nvillage of Virarajendrapett. It consists of two clean streets, at\r\nright angles, with a missionary church and school. The mountains are\r\nhere dotted with plantain-groves, and nearly every house has a small\r\ncoffee-garden attached. The surrounding country is exceedingly pretty,\r\nthe view being bounded by forest-covered mountains. The bungalow at\r\nVirarajendrapett is on the site of an old palace of the Rajahs, and\r\nthe compound is surrounded by a high wall, with an ornamental gateway,\r\nflanked by stone sentry-boxes.\r\n\r\nFrom this point the descent into Malabar commences, through dense\r\nforest, with bright moonlight glancing through the branches of gigantic\r\ntrees, and after a journey of fifteen miles we reached the bungalow of\r\nOoticully in the middle of the jungle. It is in these forests, on the\r\nwestern slopes of the Coorg mountains, that cardamom cultivation is\r\ncarried on to a great extent. In February parties of Coorgs start for\r\nthese western mountains, and, selecting a slope facing west or north,\r\nmark one of the largest trees on the steepest declivity. A space about\r\n300 feet long and 40 feet broad is then cleared of brushwood, at the\r\nfoot of the tree; a platform is rigged about twelve feet up the tree,\r\non which a pair of woodmen stand and hew away right and left until it\r\nfalls head foremost down the side of the mountain, carrying with it a\r\nnumber of smaller trees in a great crash.\r\n\r\nWithin three months after the felling, the cardamom-plants in the soil\r\nbegin to show their heads all over the cleared ground during the first\r\nrains of the monsoon, and before the end of the rainy season they grow\r\ntwo or three feet. The ground is then carefully cleared of weeds, and\r\nleft to itself for a year. In October, twenty months after the felling\r\nof the great tree, the cardamom-plants are the height of a man, and\r\nthe ground is again carefully and thoroughly cleared. In the following\r\nApril the low fruit-bearing branches shoot forth, and are soon covered\r\nwith clusters of flowers, and afterwards with capsules. Five months\r\nafterwards, in October, the first crop is gathered, and a full harvest\r\nis collected in the following year. The harvests continue for six or\r\nseven years, when they begin to fail, and another large tree must be\r\ncut down in some other locality, so as to let the light in upon a new\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\nThe harvest takes place in October, when the grass is very high and\r\nsharp, sorely cutting the hands, feet, and faces of the people. It is\r\nalso covered with innumerable large greedy leeches. The cultivators\r\npick the cardamom capsules from the branches, and convey them to a\r\ntemporary hut, where the women fill the bags with cardamoms, and carry\r\nthem home, sometimes to distances of ten or twelve miles. Some families\r\nwill gather 20 to 30 maunds annually, worth from 600 to 1000 Rs.[475]\r\n\r\nThis method of cardamom cultivation must be considered injurious to\r\nthe conservancy of fine timber in the forests, but, on the other hand,\r\nthe crops themselves are very valuable, and bring in a considerable\r\nrevenue. But there is another kind of cultivation carried on in these\r\nvast forests on the western slopes of the ghauts, which is far more\r\nprejudicial to the production of valuable timber-trees. This is called\r\n_kumari_, and _punam_ in Malabar. It has been altogether prohibited\r\nin Coorg and Mysore, while in Canara it is not now allowed within nine\r\nmiles of the sea, or three of any navigable river, or in any of the\r\nGovernment forests without previous permission. But in Malabar, where\r\nall the forests are private property, the Government is unable to\r\ninterfere in the matter, and _kumari_ is quite unrestricted.\r\n\r\n_Kumari_ is cultivation carried on in forest-clearings. A space is\r\ncleared on a hill-slope at the end of the year; the wood is left to\r\ndry until March or April, and then burnt. The seed, generally _raggee_\r\n(_Eleusine coracana_), is sown in the ashes on the fall of the first\r\nrain, the ground not being touched with any implement, but merely\r\nweeded and fenced. The produce is reaped at the end of the year, and\r\nis said to be worth double that which could be procured under ordinary\r\nmodes of cultivation. A small crop is taken in the second, and perhaps\r\nin the third year, and the spot is then deserted and allowed to grow\r\nup with jungle. The same spot is cultivated again after 10 or 12 years\r\nin Malabar, but in North Canara the wild hill tribes generally clear\r\npatches in the virgin forest. Dr. Cleghorn reports that _kumari_\r\nrenders the land unfit for coffee-cultivation, destroys valuable\r\ntimber, and makes the locality unhealthy, dense underwood being\r\nsubstituted in the abandoned clearings for tall trees under which the\r\nair circulated freely.[476] The Kurumbers and Irulas, wild tribes of\r\nthe Neilgherries, also raise small crops by burning patches of jungle\r\nand scattering seeds over the ashes. This system, which sounds so\r\nwasteful and is so injurious to the yield of timber in the forests, is\r\nexceedingly profitable to the cultivator, who has no expenses beyond\r\nthe payment of land-tax, which in these wild unfrequented spots is\r\noften evaded. A common profit is 18 to 28 Rs. an acre.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Ooticully we still had to pass through fifteen miles\r\nof jungle, before reaching the open cultivated country in northern\r\nMalabar. In driving down the ghaut the views, through occasional\r\nopenings, of the wide expanses of forest were very grand. Tall trunks\r\nof trees towered up to a great height in search of light and air,\r\npalms and bamboos waved gracefully over the road, and the range of\r\nCoorg mountains filled up the background. Most of the valuable timber\r\nhas been long since felled in these forests, excepting in the very\r\ninaccessible parts. The poon-trees (_Calophyllum angustifolium_),[477]\r\nwhich are chiefly found in Coorg, and yield most valuable spars\r\nfor masts, have become exceedingly scarce. The young trees are now\r\nvigilantly preserved. Black-wood (_Dalbergia latifolia_) is also\r\ngetting scarce, though I saw a good deal of it in some of the Coorg\r\njungles; and teak-trees of any size have almost entirely disappeared,\r\nexcepting in the forests of North Canara.\r\n\r\nAt a distance of twenty miles from the sea the cultivated country\r\ncommences in this part of Malabar, and the road on each side is lined\r\nwith pepper-fields, with occasional groves of plantains and clumps of\r\ncocoa and betel-nut palms. The land undulates in a succession of hills\r\nand dales, with rice cultivation in some of the hollows. Here the\r\npepper is regularly grown in large fields, and not in gardens as at\r\nCalicut. In the first place trees are planted in rows, usually such as\r\nhave rough or prickly bark--the jack, the mango, or the cashew-nut. In\r\nthe country we were passing through the tree used was an _Erythrina_,\r\nwith the bark of trunk and branches thickly covered with thorns. Until\r\nthe trees have grown to the proper size the land is often used for\r\nraising plantains. When the trees have attained a height of 15 or 20\r\nfeet, the pepper is planted at their bases, and soon thickly covers the\r\nstem and festoons over the branches. The pepper-cuttings or suckers are\r\nput down by the commencement of the rains in June, and in five years\r\nthe vine begins to bear. Each vine bears 500 to 700 bunches, which\r\nyield about 8 or 10 seers when dried. During its growth it is necessary\r\nto remove all suckers, and the vine is pruned, thinned, and kept clear\r\nof weeds. The vine bears for thirty years, but every ten years the old\r\nstem is cut down and layers are trained. It is an exceedingly pretty\r\ncultivation, and, if it was not for the crests of straggling branches\r\nwhich crown the vine-covered trunks, it would not be unlike the\r\nhop-fields of Kent.\r\n\r\nThe houses on the road were built of laterite, large and comfortable\r\nlike those at Calicut. We saw the people sitting before their doors,\r\nbusy with their heaps of pepper. When the berries have been gathered\r\nthey are dried in the sun on mats, and turn from red to black. The\r\nwhite pepper is from the same plant, the fruit being freed from the\r\nouter skin by macerating the ripe berries in water. Before reaching\r\nCannanore we passed over three or four miles of elevated rocky land,\r\nwithout cultivation, and arrived in the cantonment late at night.\r\n\r\nIn enumerating the localities where it is likely that chinchona-plants\r\nwill thrive, the mountainous country in Mysore, north of Coorg,\r\nincluding Nuggur and the Baba-Bodeen hills, must not be forgotten.\r\nNuggur consists of rounded hills, from 4000 to 5000 feet above the\r\nsea, with peaks rising as high as 6000; and the adjoining Baba-Bodeen\r\nhills attain a height of 5700 feet. The climate is exceedingly moist,\r\nand at the town of Nuggur, on the western side of the hills, the rains\r\nlast for nine months, during six of which they are so heavy that the\r\ninhabitants cannot leave their houses. The eastern side is drier and\r\nmore level. North of Nuggur the chain of western ghauts sinks down far\r\nbelow the chinchona zone, and north of 14° they scarcely rise above the\r\nplain of Dharwar.[478]\r\n\r\nThere are several profitable coffee plantations in Nuggur, and I\r\nunderstand that it is in contemplation to establish a teak plantation\r\nin that district. Though, as a locality for chinchona cultivation,\r\nit is not to be compared with the Neilgherries or Pulneys, or even\r\nwith Coorg, still it is probable that some of the hardier species\r\nmight thrive there, and thus the area of the chinchona-plants would\r\nbe eventually extended from Nuggur, in 14° N., to the hills near\r\nCourtallum, in the extreme end of the peninsula.\r\n\r\nWe embarked at Cannanore on board a little steamer for Bombay. The view\r\nfrom the sea is pretty. On the left is an old fort built long ago by\r\nthe Dutch; in the centre, looking from the anchorage, is a sandy beach,\r\nwhere elephants were being loaded with the luggage of a detachment of\r\ntroops just arrived from Calicut; and a little to the right is the\r\nnative town surrounded by extensive groves of cocoanut-trees, with the\r\nblue line of the Coorg and Wynaad mountains visible in the distance.\r\nThere are three very large buildings on the sea-shore, one of which is\r\nthe palace of the Beebee, a long house, with the ground-floor let out\r\nas a pepper warehouse.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese built a fort at Cannanore in 1505. They were driven out\r\nby the Dutch, who sold the place to a Moplah, from whom the present\r\nBeebee of Cannanore is descended, the succession going in the female\r\nline. She is much in debt, but owns the Laccadive islands, as well\r\nas Cannanore, and the land round the town. We were told that the\r\nBeebee considered that she had been shamefully treated by the English\r\nGovernment, and that she spoke her mind very freely on the subject.\r\nIt appears that, in about 1545, the Laccadive islands were conferred\r\nin jagheer on the head of the Moplah caste at Cannanore, the ancestor\r\nof the Beebee, by the Rajah of Cherikul, on the payment of a certain\r\ntribute, which was duly rendered to the Cherikul family until its\r\ndestruction by Hyder Ali in the last century. After the storming of\r\nCannanore by the English in 1791, the islands came into possession of\r\nthe East India Company, and in 1799 they were restored to the Beebee's\r\nfamily, subject to the payment of an annual _peshcush_ of 10,000 Rs.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1847, a hurricane of unequalled violence swept over the\r\nislands, which are only nine feet above the sea in the highest part.\r\nThe wind tore up the trees by the roots, the waves flooded the land,\r\nand almost everything on the two most valuable islands was destroyed.\r\nThe Beebee borrowed a steamer from the Government to send supplies\r\nfor the relief of the islanders, and she also obtained a remission\r\nof one-third of the _peshcush_ for ten years, on certain conditions\r\nconnected with reforms in her administration. Her difficulties have\r\nchiefly arisen from being unable to pay the sum demanded for arrears\r\nof _peshcush_, and for the use of the steamer, and in 1854 the English\r\nGovernment assumed the administration of the islands until the debt was\r\npaid. It was desired that the Beebee should give them up altogether\r\nfor a pecuniary equivalent, but to this she has resolutely refused to\r\nconsent. The islands have since been restored to her.[479]\r\n\r\nOn the day after sailing from Cannanore we put into Mangalore, where\r\nthe town, like that of Calicut, is completely hidden from the sea,\r\nthe lighthouse and a few bungalows being visible on a hill in the\r\nrear. This was the dry season, and the coast of Canara was not nearly\r\nso pretty as that of Malabar, looking parched and dried up. North of\r\nMangalore is the port of Compta, with a lighthouse on a steep conical\r\nhill, but no town visible. Compta is now the port of shipment for the\r\ncotton of Dharwar, and there were several _pattamars_ in the anchorage,\r\nwith their decks piled up with bales of cotton. They take it up to\r\nBombay, where it is pressed and shipped for England; and we heard that\r\nthe crews of the pattamars work their way into the bales, and pull out\r\nlarge handfuls of cotton, filling the space up with filth. In this way\r\nthere is a petty trade in stolen cotton along the coast, and the people\r\nwork it up into gloves, stockings, &c., for sale.\r\n\r\nThough, at the time of my visit, Compta was used as the cotton-port\r\nfor Dharwar, yet the port of Sedashighur, further north, has a great\r\nadvantage over it, and is the only place along the coast where there\r\nis safe anchorage during the S.W. monsoon. A point of land, called\r\nCarwar head, forms and protects the bay of Carwar and Beitcool cove,\r\nand, with the assistance of a breakwater, there would be safe anchorage\r\nthroughout the year. A line of islands and rocks, called the Oyster\r\nrocks, a little to the northward, also offers a place of shelter. There\r\nis an anchorage under their lee during the S.W. monsoon, where vessels\r\nmight ride in perfect safety, and, when a lighthouse is established\r\non the highest Oyster rock, vessels will be able to approach this\r\ndangerous coast, and run into the anchorage, during the summer months.\r\nSedashighur is nearer Dharwar than any other port; a river, the\r\nKala-nuddee, navigable for boats for twenty miles, falls into the sea\r\nclose to the anchorage, and a good road is all that is required to make\r\nthis place an important port for the shipment of cotton. Energetic\r\nmeasures have already been adopted for this purpose, and it will\r\nnot be long before Dharwar, the only cotton district in India where\r\nthe American species has as yet been profitably cultivated, will be\r\nsupplied with a port where the cotton may be pressed and shipped direct\r\nfor England.[480]\r\n\r\nAfter passing Sedashighur we put into Goa harbour, and went thence\r\nto Vingorla, the port of the Belgaum district, and a great place for\r\nthe manufacture of earthenware chatties, which are taken up the coast\r\nin pattamars. The following day we were at Rutnagherry, and passing\r\nSevendroog, the famous stronghold of the pirate Angria, we concluded\r\nour coasting voyage by anchoring in Bombay harbour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE MAHABALESHWUR HILLS AND THE DECCAN.\r\n\r\n  Journey from Bombay to Malcolm-penth--The Mahabaleshwur\r\n  Hills--The village and its temples--Elevation of the\r\n  hills--Formation--Soil--Climate--Vegetation--Sites for\r\n  chinchona-plantations--Paunchgunny--Waee--Its temples--The\r\n  babool-tree--Shirwul--The village system--Village officials--Barra\r\n  balloota--Cultivators--Festivals--Crops and harvests--Poona--The Bhore\r\n  ghaut--Return to Bombay.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE districts best adapted for the cultivation of chinchona-plants are\r\nthose in the southern part of the peninsula, at suitable elevations,\r\nwhich receive moisture from both monsoons. The Neilgherry hills are\r\nthe centre of these hill districts, and as we advance further from\r\nthat nucleus in a northerly direction the rainfall from the south-west\r\nmonsoon becomes heavier, while the climate of the winter, when easterly\r\nwinds are blowing, increases in dryness. In 14° N. lat. the hills of\r\nNuggur sink down into the plains of Dharwar, and from that point to\r\nthe Mahabaleshwur hills in 18° N. there are few parts of the western\r\nghauts which attain a sufficient elevation for the successful growth of\r\nchinchona-plants.[481]\r\n\r\nThe Mahabaleshwurs, however, are upwards of 4000 feet above the sea,\r\nand it was therefore possible that they might present localities\r\nsuitable for chinchona cultivation. In February 1861 I started from\r\nthe Mazagon bunder, at Bombay, in a bunder-boat, for the purpose of\r\nexamining these hills, and, crossing the harbour, coasted for a short\r\ndistance along the shores of the Concan, and then sailed up the\r\nNagotna river, with low jungle on either side. At Nagotna two sets\r\nof _hamals_ were waiting for us, and we started for Mhar, a distance\r\nof forty miles across the low country of the Concan. The _hamals_ or\r\npalkee-bearers belong to the _Mhar_ or _Parwari_ caste, who are also\r\nwatchmen, porters, and guides, and are believed to be the aborigines\r\nof the country. They are athletic men, with slender and remarkably\r\nsymmetrical figures when young, always working in gangs of twelve\r\nto each palkee, three at each end, and the others relieving them at\r\nintervals. They carry the weight with a skill which only a life-long\r\npractice could give, and go over the ground at the rate of four miles\r\nan hour, at a sort of trot.\r\n\r\nThe country is generally well covered with rice-fields, now in stubble;\r\nand the numerous stacks of rice-straw, raised five or six feet from the\r\nground on stakes, formed the principal feature of the landscape. A few\r\nmiles beyond Mhar the western ghauts rise abruptly from the plain of\r\nthe Concan, in two gigantic steps. The first step is ascended by the\r\nsteep corkscrew road of the Parr ghaut, and between its summit and the\r\nfoot of the Rartunda ghaut, which winds up the second step, there is\r\na level cultivated plateau. To the left of the road, overlooking the\r\nConcan, there is a steep conical hill, crowned by the famous robber\r\nfort of Pertaubghur. Here, in 1659, Sevajee, the famous founder of\r\nMahratta power, assassinated Afzul Khan, the general of the Mohammedan\r\nKing of Beejapore's army, at an interview. We could see the dark walls\r\nof the fort, with ruined buildings, and a tall tree rising behind them.\r\nThe ascent of the second ghaut brought us, almost immediately, into\r\nthe hill station of Mahabaleshwur. The view from our lodging embraced\r\na foreground of rounded hills covered with green wood, with ranges of\r\npointed, rounded, and flattened peaks in the distance, shimmering in\r\nthe rays of a hot sun.\r\n\r\nThe Mahabaleshwur hills are the loftiest part of the western ghauts\r\nin the Bombay presidency. They form an undulating table-land of small\r\nextent, terminated to the westward by a very abrupt descent, often\r\nforming scarped precipices overhanging the Concan; and sloping down\r\nmore gradually on the side of the Deccan. The highest point, close\r\nto the English station, in lat. 17° 59´ N., is only 4700 feet above\r\nthe sea. The English station, with a native bazar and village, was\r\nformed by Sir John Malcolm in 1828, and has received the name of\r\nMalcolm-penth. Several of the surrounding peaks are named after his\r\ndaughters. The roads are excellent, and are bordered by such trees and\r\nshrubs as jasmine, figs, _Randias_, _Gnidias_, and _Crotalariæ_, with\r\na pretty white _Clematis_ climbing over them. The station is near the\r\nedge of a range of precipitous mountain crags and cliffs overlooking\r\nthe Parr valley. The cliffs are broken by several profound ravines,\r\nthus forming promontories commanding grand views of the hill fort of\r\nPertaubghur, the Concan, and even the sea on very clear days. Good\r\ncarriage-roads have been made to those points which command the best\r\nviews, such as Babington, Bombay, Sidney, and Elphinstone points, all\r\nlooking west. From Babington point there is a magnificent view. The\r\nstation, with numerous bungalows peeping out amongst the trees to the\r\nnorth, is seen along the crest of a ridge which is separated from\r\nBabington point by a profound ravine. The precipitous cliffs, now dried\r\nup and barren, are scarped and furrowed by the water which deluges them\r\nduring the prevalence of the south-west monsoon; but there was one\r\nbright green spot where some potatoes were cultivated in terraces, on\r\nthe edge of a precipice.\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous object in the station is an obelisk of laterite,\r\nerected to the memory of Sir Sidney Beckwith. From this point,\r\nimmediately above the little thatched church, there is a good view\r\nof the station, the numerous bungalows, peeping out amongst their\r\nshrubberies, dotted about in all directions; the billiard bungalow,\r\nsanatarium, and public library, all built of laterite, standing in an\r\nopen space; the native bazar at our feet; and a curiously shaped mass\r\nof mountain peaks to the south and west.\r\n\r\nOne day we rode over to the native village of Mahabaleshwur, which\r\nis three miles from Malcolm-penth. The little village consists of\r\na few dozen thatched huts, on the side of a wooded hill, and some\r\nvery interesting temples. By the roadside, in the hedges surrounding\r\nthe huts, there were roses, daturas, and jambul-trees (_Eugenia\r\njambolanum_) with heads of graceful flowers.\r\n\r\nThe chief temple, built at the foot of a steep hill, has an open space\r\nin front. The exterior wall is faced with pilasters painted yellow,\r\nthe intermediate space being red. In the centre there is an arched\r\ndoorway leading into an interior cloister, built round a tank. No\r\nEuropean is allowed to enter, but, from the outside, a cow carved in\r\nstone is visible on the opposite side of the tank, with a stream of\r\nwater pouring from its mouth. This fountain is said to be the source of\r\nthe Krishna, and the temple is considered very sacred in consequence.\r\nTo the right, and a little in front of the temple, there is a square\r\nchapel sacred to Siva or Mahadeo. A flight of steps leads up to three\r\nnarrow arched doorways, the centre one being occupied by an image of\r\nthe bull _Nandi_ in stone, in a sitting posture, with its back to\r\nthe people, and facing the image of the God inside. The chapel is\r\nsurmounted by a very picturesque dome, with stone tigers at each angle.\r\nTall trees and thick bushes cover the hill in the rear immediately\r\nabove the larger temple, and on the left there is a long native\r\n_choultry_, with a thatched roof.\r\n\r\nThese temples were built about a century ago by a rich banker of\r\nSattara, but they stand on the sites of more ancient structures, the\r\nwork of Gowlee Rajahs. The Gowlees are a race of aboriginal herdsmen,\r\nscattered over the western ghauts from Mahabaleshwur to Kolapore.\r\nThough they now speak the Mahratta language, yet a great number of\r\ntheir words, their features, and many of their customs are Canarese;\r\nand they are evidently a branch of the great Dravidian group of nations.\r\n\r\nThe temples of Mahabaleshwur possess extensive landed property, some\r\nof it on the slopes overhanging the Parr valley. It is in charge of an\r\nhereditary Enamdar, who lives in the Deccan, and visits the temples\r\nonce a year. He keeps them in tolerable repair, and pockets the surplus\r\nof their revenues. From the village there is an extensive view of the\r\ndeep valley of the Krishna and Yena, to the eastward, which slopes down\r\nabruptly from the hill on which Mahabaleshwur is built.\r\n\r\nAs in Coorg there is a curious legend respecting the origin of the\r\nCauvery, so in the Mahabaleshwur hills an equally wild story is\r\nattached to the source of the Krishna. It is said that two giants,\r\ncalled Mahaballee and Anteeballee, made war upon the Brahmins, until\r\nthey were destroyed by Siva. Before they died they asked a favour,\r\nwhich was granted, namely, that they and their followers might be\r\nturned into rivers. This is the fabulous origin of five rivers:--the\r\nKrishna, named in honour of one of Vishnu's avaturs; the Koina and\r\nthe Yena, flowing to the Deccan; and the rivers Sawitri and Gawitri,\r\nfinding their way through gorges to the westward, and becoming\r\ntributaries of the Bancoot river in the Concan. The Krishna is looked\r\nupon as a personation of the God Krishna in a female form, and is often\r\ncalled _baee_ or lady Krishna. This important stream, issuing from\r\nthe cow's mouth at Mahabaleshwur, flows down a gorge bounded by steep\r\nbarren hills, terminating in rocky cliffs. We could see the river, like\r\na silver thread, meandering through some cultivated land far below; but\r\nthe general aspect of the country was barren and cheerless. During the\r\nmonsoon it is doubtless quite green.\r\n\r\nThe Mahabaleshwur hills average an elevation of 4500 feet above the\r\nsea. They are composed almost entirely of laterite,[482] overlying\r\neruptive rocks, such as basalt, greenstone, and amygdaloid; and the\r\nsoil is a clay resulting from the disintegration of the laterite.\r\n\r\nOn these hills October is the commencement of the dry season, but\r\nduring that month the amount of aqueous vapour in the atmosphere is\r\nstill considerable, while the temperature is cool and equable. From\r\nNovember the air becomes gradually drier until the end of February;\r\nthe weather is dry and cold, and a sharp dry easterly wind usually\r\nprevails. The mean temperature of this season is 64°, with a daily\r\nvariation of about 12°. Fogs and mists commence in March, and gradually\r\nincrease until the rain begins in the end of May. The hottest month is\r\nApril. From the end of May to September there is almost incessant rain,\r\nand the hills are constantly enveloped in clouds and fog. The mean\r\ntemperature of the rainy season is 64.5°, but the daily variation is\r\nonly 3°. The average rainfall is 227 inches, of which nearly one-third\r\ncomes down in August.[483] (See Table, next page.)\r\n\r\nThe vegetation of these hills, as might be expected from the essential\r\ndifference in the climate, is quite distinct from that of the\r\nNeilgherries. There is a great want of forest-trees in the jungles,\r\nand the trees and bushes are, as a rule, poor and stunted. The hills\r\nare covered with grass and ferns, and are dotted over with a shrub\r\ncalled by the natives _rumeta_. It is the _Lasiosiphon speciosus_,[484]\r\nwith flowers something like small Guelder roses, clustered in terminal\r\numbels. The _Randia dumetorum_, a thorny bush, is also common. In the\r\nthickets I observed a _Memecylon_, called by the natives _anjun_, a\r\nmelastomaceous tree, with beautiful purple flowers;[485] a small\r\n_Crotalaria_, with a bright yellow flower; a _Jasminum_; an\r\n_Indigofera_; the _Eugenia Jambolanum_; the pretty creeping _Clematis\r\nWightiana_; some willows near streams; a _Solanum_; and the _Curcuma\r\ncaulina_, a kind of arrowroot, with enormous leaves, sometimes tinged\r\nwith red,[486] in flower during the rains.[487]\r\n\r\n                        MAHABALESHWUR HILLS.\r\n         Mean    Mean     Mean     Extreme  Extreme  Mean  Rainfall\r\n  MONTH.

The intense\r\ndryness of the atmosphere during the greater part of the year, the poor\r\ncharacter of the vegetation, and even the enormous rainfall during\r\nthe summer months, which more resembles the climatic conditions of\r\nthe forests of Canelos to the eastward, than the region of \"red-bark\"\r\ntrees to the westward of Chimborazo, all pointed to this conclusion.\r\nNevertheless some seeds of chinchona-plants were forwarded to Mr.\r\nDalzell, the Conservator of forests in the Bombay Presidency, which\r\nare said to have come up well at Mahabaleshwur. If these plants\r\nshould really thrive it will prove that they are capable of adapting\r\nthemselves to differences of climate to an extent of which we\r\npreviously had no idea. I sincerely trust that this may be the case,\r\nand that some at least of the species of Chinchonæ now in India may\r\nbe successfully introduced into the Mahabaleshwur hills. Mr. Dalzell\r\ninforms me that there are high hills to the eastward of the Portuguese\r\nsettlement of Goa, but not so elevated as Mahabaleshwur, where he\r\nthinks that some of the Chinchonæ, which flourish at low elevations,\r\nmight be acclimatized. He had observed that, in the Bombay Presidency,\r\na difference of 150 to 200 miles southing is equivalent to a certain\r\nelevation, that is, that plants confined to the highest ground in lat.\r\n18° are found at a much lower level in lat. 15°; and that members of\r\nthe family of Chinchonaceæ increase in the number of genera and species\r\nas we travel south from Mahabaleshwur, along the summit of the range,\r\nto lat. 15°.\r\n\r\nThe road down into the Deccan, from Malcolm-penth, leads to the\r\neastward over hills bare of jungle, and sprinkled over with a scanty\r\ngrowth of _Lasiosiphons_ and ferns. After six miles it begins to pass\r\nalong a ridge or saddle, with the deep valley of the Krishna on one\r\nside, and that of the Yena on the other. The hills which bound these\r\nvalleys are very precipitous, and, at this season, look grey and\r\nbarren, with ridges of rock cropping out, entirely destitute of all\r\nvegetation. The valleys and lower slopes of the hills are covered with\r\nfields of grain, now in stubble, but which must look bright and green\r\nduring the rainy season.\r\n\r\nAt a distance of ten miles from Malcolm-penth, on a slope overlooking\r\nthe Krishna valley, there are some small experimental farms, belonging\r\nto apothecaries in Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy's hospital at Bombay,\r\nat a place called Paunchgunny. An application was made for some\r\nchinchona-plants, to be raised at Paunchgunny; no doubt all possible\r\ncare and attention would have been bestowed upon them; and I,\r\ntherefore, regret that it should be a locality where they are not at\r\nall likely to flourish. Here the road descends the Tai ghaut into the\r\nDeccan, and in a couple of hours we reached the bungalow on the banks\r\nof the river Krishna, opposite the town of Waee.\r\n\r\nThe town on the other side of the river, with its numerous temples,\r\nwas by far the most interesting place, in an architectural point of\r\nview, that we had yet seen. Long flights of stone steps lead up from\r\nthe waters of the sacred Krishna to the paved platform on which the\r\ntemples are built. Crowds of women and children in blue dresses, and\r\nmen in white cotton cloths and red turbans, were washing their clothes\r\nin the river, or sitting on the steps and gazing into the water, while\r\nnaked Brahmins employed themselves in scrubbing the copper utensils of\r\nthe temples. The largest and most imposing temple is that dedicated\r\nto Ganesa, or Gunputty as he is called in the Deccan. It is a mass of\r\nsolid masonry, whence a wide flight of stone steps leads down to the\r\nKrishna. The shrine itself is a plain stone building, with a large\r\nvestibule in front, consisting of four arched entrances on each side,\r\nand three at the end. The ceiling of this porch is very curious. It\r\nis formed of square flagstones fitted into each other, and clamped\r\ntogether above, so as to make a flat surface exactly resembling the\r\npavement below. From the porch a square doorway leads into the shrine,\r\nwhich is a small chamber without ornament or decoration, with the\r\ncolossal figure of Gunputty facing the entrance. The idol, with a huge\r\nelephant's head, the trunk of which it holds in one of its four hands,\r\nan enormous belly, and cross legs, is hewn out of a solid block of\r\nblack stone.\r\n\r\nThe temple of Gunputty is surmounted by a very remarkable spire,\r\nconsisting of broad concave flutings rising out of a circlet of\r\nlotus-leaves, and approaching each other slightly as they ascend, until\r\nthey finally terminate in another circle of lotus-leaves, out of which\r\na fluted dome rises and crowns the spire. The whole effect is very\r\ngood, and forms the principal feature in the view of Waee from the\r\nright bank of the Krishna.\r\n\r\nA little further back there is a small temple dedicated to Siva or\r\nMahadeo, surrounded by a high wall. Within the enclosure, and in\r\nfront of the shrine, there is a canopy supported on sixteen stone\r\ncolumns, the inner four being under a small dome, and the rest of\r\nthe roof consisting of a very curious pavement-like ceiling, exactly\r\nsimilar to that in front of Gunputty's temple. Advancing through this\r\nvestibule, which is a plain but perfect piece of masonry in very good\r\ntaste, we came to a large image of Siva's bull, called _Nandi_, under\r\na _mandap_ or canopy, supported by four pillars. The image, which is\r\nin a sitting posture, with its head turned towards the door of the\r\nshrine, has numerous ornaments carved about its head and neck, amongst\r\nthem a necklace of bells. It is hewn out of an immense block of stone.\r\nImmediately in front of _Nandi_ is the shrine itself, but the interior\r\nwas too dark to enable us to discern the god. The lower part of the\r\nbuilding is of plain masonry, with two small square windows in fretted\r\nstone-work; but the upper part is surmounted by a richly-carved spire\r\nand dome, while on the cornice of the roof there are niches containing\r\nstone figures. The spire has three tiers of gods round it in niches,\r\nand is crowned by a fluted dome, resting on a circlet of lotus-leaves.\r\nThere is another temple on the platform facing the river, dedicated to\r\nParvati, Siva's wife.\r\n\r\nBy the time we had completed the examination of these temples, we were\r\nsurrounded by a great crowd of Brahmins, _hamals_, girls and boys, who\r\ncontinued to follow us about.\r\n\r\nWe then went up one of the streets of this most devout little town,\r\nand came to a temple dedicated to Vishnu, the enclosure of which is\r\nalso surrounded by a high wall, with lean-to grain-shops outside. The\r\ninterior of the enclosure is lined with betel-nut palms, and paved with\r\nlarge flags, on one of which the figure of a tortoise is carved. The\r\ntemple stands in the centre, with a richly ornamented spire above it.\r\nThe interior consists of a nave, with aisles on each side, and at the\r\nend, opposite the doorway, there is an open grating, within which is\r\nthe deity. The temple was crowded with nautch-girls, and numbers of\r\npeople were passing in and out, doing _poojah_. They first prostrated\r\nthemselves at the entrance, then before the grating, and finally\r\ntouched a bell overhead before giving place to other devotees. Nearly\r\nopposite Vishnu's temple is another to his wife Lakshmi.\r\n\r\nWe afterwards walked through the bazar, a busy interesting scene,\r\ncrowded with people. We saw exposed for sale grains of all kinds in\r\nbaskets, heaps of red ochre for painting Gods and the sect-marks on\r\nthe forehead,[488] sweetmeats, cotton cloths, muslins, and chatties of\r\nclay and copper. Near the river there are five smaller temples to Siva,\r\neach with its _Nandi_ outside the door, and many sacred peepul-trees,\r\nsurrounded by walls of solid masonry.\r\n\r\nAt sunset the view of Waee from the opposite side of the river, with\r\nthe temples reflected in the water, the thickets of trees behind, and\r\nthe crowds of people in snow-white cotton dresses and red turbans, was\r\nenchanting. Waee derives its great sanctity partly from being on the\r\nbanks of the sacred Krishna, and partly from the tradition that it was\r\nthe residence of the five Pandus, the favourite mythical heroes of\r\nthe Hindus, during part of the time of their exile. The people still\r\nhave many tales respecting their deeds, especially those of Bhima, who\r\nwas the biggest and strongest of the five. A peak rising above the\r\ndried-up barren line of mountains behind the town is called after them\r\n_Pandughur_. The temples of Waee were chiefly built, about a century\r\nago, by the head of a wealthy Mahratta family named Rastia.\r\n\r\nFrom Waee we travelled over dried-up plains, with arid desolate hills\r\nin the distance, and reached the village of Shirwul at early dawn.\r\nThere were a few banyans near the road, and some babool-trees (_Acacia\r\nArabica_) dotted about over the plain. The babool-tree in the Deccan\r\nhas the same uses as the carob in Peru. The hard tough wood is\r\nextensively used for ploughshares, naves of wheels, and tent-pegs; its\r\nnecklace-shaped pods are favourite food for sheep and goats, and the\r\nbark is used for tanning.[489] It flourishes on dry arid plains, and\r\nespecially in black cotton-soil, where other trees are rarely met with.\r\nThe hedges round Shirwul are of prickly pear or milk-bush (_Euphorbia\r\ntirucalli_[490]).\r\n\r\nShirwul is one amongst many of those village communities of the Deccan\r\nwhich have retained their peculiar customs and organization from time\r\nimmemorial. The Hindu Rajahs have been succeeded by Mohammedan Kings,\r\nwho in their turn have been followed by Mogul Subadars, Mahratta\r\nPeishwas, and English Collectors, but the village communities have\r\ncontinued unchanged through all these revolutions, and thus the\r\ngreat mass of the people still live under institutions which excite\r\nveneration from their immense age. The cultivator of the Deccan obeys\r\nprecisely the same rules and has the same customs as were followed\r\nby his ancestor before the period of history commenced; and, as\r\nthe land-assessment has now been established for thirty years, on\r\nremarkably easy terms, his condition may not disadvantageously be\r\ncompared with that of any other peasantry in the world.\r\n\r\nThe village-system of the Deccan is so curious in itself, and so\r\ninteresting from its unknown antiquity, that some account of one of\r\nthe villages a few miles from Poona, similar in all respects to that\r\nof Shirwul, will not be out of place. I have taken it from an article\r\nwritten thirty years ago.[491]\r\n\r\nThe land belonging to the village comprises 3669 acres, 1955 arable\r\nand the rest common pasture, with hedges of milk-bush (_Euphorbia\r\ntirucalli_) enclosing the garden-grounds. The village, which is\r\nsurrounded by a mud wall with two gates, includes 107 dwelling-houses\r\nof sun-dried bricks with terraced roofs, a _chowree_ or town-hall, and\r\nthree temples. The houses have _wosurees_ or open porticos in front,\r\nand the interiors consist of three or four small dark rooms with no\r\nwindows. The temples are of hewn stone and _chunam_.\r\n\r\nThe boundaries and institutions of the village have undergone no\r\nalteration from time immemorial, and its offices are hereditary.\r\nThey consist of that of the _Pattel_ or chief magistrate, his deputy\r\nthe _Chowgulla_, the _Koolcurny_ or accountant, and of the _Barra\r\nBalloota_, or twelve subordinate servants.\r\n\r\nThe _Pattel_ holds his office, which is hereditary and saleable, from\r\nGovernment, under a written obligation specifying his duties, rank,\r\nand the ceremonies he is entitled to. He has to collect the Government\r\ndues from the cultivators, punish offences, redress wrongs, and settle\r\ndisputes. In important cases he summons a _Punchayet_ or sort of jury,\r\nand when they are of a serious nature he refers them to the _Amildar_\r\nor Collector of revenue.\r\n\r\nThe _Koolcurny_ or accountant keeps the records and accounts,\r\ncomprising a general measurement of village-lands, a list of fields, of\r\nthe inhabitants, and a detailed account of the revenue. He is generally\r\na Brahmin, and has lands or fees allotted to him by Government.\r\n\r\nThe _Barra Balloota_ offices are hereditary, and the holders, called\r\n_Ballootadars_, are bound to their services to the community for a\r\nfixed proportion of the produce of the soil, from each cultivator. They\r\nare twelve in number, namely, the _Sutar_ or carpenter, who repairs all\r\nwooden instruments; the _Lohar_ or blacksmith, who keeps all iron-work\r\nin repair; the _Parit_ or washerman, who washes all the men's clothes;\r\nthe _Nahawi_ or barber, who shaves and cuts the nails of the villagers,\r\nand kneads the muscles and cracks the joints of the Pattel and\r\nKoolcurny; the _Kumbhar_ or potter; the _Potedar_ or silversmith; the\r\n_Goorow_ or dresser of idols; the _Koli_ or water-carrier; the _Mang_\r\nor ropemaker, who makes ropes of _Hibiscus cannabis_, and is of very\r\nlow caste; and the _Mhar_ or _Parwarree_, an outcast whose dwelling is\r\noutside the village--he acts as watchman, carries letters, and gives\r\nevidence as to village rights, before Punchayets; the _Tsamhar_ or\r\ncobbler, and _Gramjosi_ or astrologer.\r\n\r\nBesides the above duties, the Ballootadars have certain perquisites.\r\nThe carpenter furnishes the stool on which the brides and bridegrooms\r\nare bathed in the marriage ceremony; the blacksmith sticks the hook\r\nthrough the flesh of devotees who swing; the barber plays on the pipe\r\nand tabor at weddings; and the potter prepares the stewed mutton\r\nat harvest-homes. In addition to the Ballootadars there are some\r\nother lower officials called _Alutadars_, consisting of a watchman,\r\ngatekeeper, betel-man, gardener, bard, musician, and host of the\r\nGanjams of the Lingayet sect.\r\n\r\nThe cultivators of the Deccan are lean short men, with black straight\r\nhair, kept shorn except on the upper lip, bronze complexions, high\r\ncheek-bones, low foreheads, and teeth stained with betel. They are\r\ntemperate and hard-working, warmly attached to their children, frugal,\r\nand not improvident, but deceitful, cunning, and false. Their food\r\nconsists of grains, pulses, greens, roots, fruits, hot spices, and oil;\r\ntogether with milk and ghee. No liquor is sold in the villages. Their\r\nevery-day fare is first a cake of _bajree_,[492] or _jowaree_,[493]\r\nbaked on a plate of iron; secondly green pods or fruits cut in pieces,\r\nand boiled with pepper, garlic, or turmeric; and thirdly a porridge\r\nof coarse-ground _jowaree_ and salt. They have three meals daily. For\r\nbreakfast they eat a cake with spiced vegetables, and a raw onion;\r\ntheir wives bring them their dinners in the fields at noon, consisting\r\nof two cakes and green pods boiled; and porridge and milk form their\r\nsuppers. The holiday fare is cakes of pulse and sugar, and balls of\r\nsplit gram and spices.[494]\r\n\r\nThese hard-working people generally wear nothing but a dirty rag\r\nbetween their legs, and another round their heads. On holidays,\r\nhowever, they come out in a white turban, a frock of white cloth coming\r\ndown to the knees, a cloth round the waist, and a pair of drawers. The\r\nfurniture of their dwellings generally comprises two wooden pestles\r\nand a stone mortar, earthenware and copper utensils, a wooden dish for\r\nkneading dough, a flat stone and rolling pin for powdering spices, two\r\niron cups for lamps suspended by a chain, and two couches laced with\r\nrope; the total value being about 40 shillings.\r\n\r\nThe men, as well as the women, are very fond of attending annual\r\npilgrimages at the temples, and several festivals break the monotony of\r\ntheir working days, the chief of which are the _Hooli_, the _Dussera_,\r\nthe _Dewallee_, and another in honour of the cattle. The _Hooli_ is\r\nheld at the full moon in April, and lasts five days. The _Dussera_,\r\nto celebrate the destruction of the Demon Mysore by the Goddess Kali,\r\nis in October, and the _Dewallee_ twenty days afterwards. The cattle\r\nfestival is in August, when the oxen are painted and dressed up, fed\r\nwith sugar, and worshipped by their owners. In the hot dry months the\r\ncultivators hunt deer, hares, and wild hogs.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural implements used in the Deccan are the same as were in\r\nuse upwards of 3000 years ago. They consist of a plough, which makes\r\na mere scratch, made of babool-wood; a rude cart on two solid wheels;\r\na harrow with wooden teeth; and a drill-plough.[495] The oxen do most\r\nof the work; and the sheep are black and white, with long hanging\r\nears. There are two crops, called the _Khereef_ and _Rubbee_. In the\r\n_Khereef_ crop the sowing takes place in June and July, and the harvest\r\nin October. _Bajree_ is sown with a drill-plough in rows, mixed with\r\n_toor_ and other pulses. It is the chief food of the people. Next comes\r\nthe other common grain _jowaree_. Italian millet, _raggee_, _badlee_,\r\nand the _amaranthus_ are sown in smaller quantities. All land, whether\r\nploughed or not, is subjected to the drag-hoe, first lengthways and\r\nthen across, loosening the surface and destroying weeds: and crops of\r\nmillets are alternated with those of pulses. When the harvest begins,\r\na level spot is chosen for a threshing-floor, and made dry and hard.\r\nA pole, five feet high, is fixed in the centre, the grains are heaped\r\nround the floor, and the women break off the ears and throw them in.\r\nOxen are then tied to each other and to the post, and driven round,\r\nto beat out the corn. Winnowing is done by a man standing on a high\r\nstool, and pouring out the grain and chaff to the winds. Ceremonies are\r\nthen performed in honour of the five Pandus, and the grain is stored\r\nin large baskets. The pulses which are sown in the _Khereef_ crop are\r\n_toor_ raised in _jowaree_ and _bajree_ fields, the pods of which are\r\ndetached by beating the plant with a log of wood; _moong_, sown by\r\nitself, and when ripe pulled up by the roots; _ooreed_; _mutkee_; and\r\n_lablab_.\r\n\r\nPlants from which cordage is made, namely the _sun_ (_Crotalaria\r\njuncea_) and _ambadee_ (_Hibiscus cannabinus_) are also raised. They\r\ngrow to a height of five or six feet, and are then pulled up, steeped\r\nfor some days in water, and the bark stripped off.\r\n\r\nIn the _Rubbee_, or cold season crop, the sowing takes place in October\r\nand November, and the harvests in February. At this time wheat is sown\r\nin rich black or loamy soil, well manured; _gram_ (_Cicer arietinum_)\r\nin the best black soil; and flax, generally raised on the edge of\r\nwheat-fields, in strips of four rows. The land is only ploughed once in\r\ntwo years, to the depth of a span.\r\n\r\nAs the Indians of Peru live chiefly on roots, so the natives of the\r\nparts of India which I visited find their chief sustenance in numerous\r\nkinds of millets and pulses. Rice is certainly their favourite food;\r\nbut, from the expenses attending the necessary irrigation, it is\r\ndearer and not so easily attainable as the other cereals, and the\r\ngreat mass of the people live on dry grains and pulses. All these\r\ncereals contain less nourishing matter than wheat, being comparatively\r\npoor in nitrogen, but this deficiency is made up by the pulses which\r\nare generally eaten with them. It is a most remarkable fact that the\r\nnatives habitually combine these two different kinds of food, in their\r\ndishes, in about the same proportions as science has found to be\r\nnecessary in order that the mixture may contain the same proportion of\r\ncarbonous to nitrogenous matter as is found in wheat.[496]\r\n\r\nEvery one who has travelled much, in different parts of the world, or\r\nwho has reflected at all on the subject, well knows that there is\r\nfar more happiness than misery on this earth, that the good outweighs\r\nthe evil, and that the wars and revolutions of history are but specks\r\non the long periods of tranquillity which remain for ever unrecorded.\r\nThe village system of the Deccan is a venerable monument, reminding us\r\nhow little the turmoils and civil wars, invasions, and revolutions,\r\nof which history is composed, affect the mass of the people. The\r\nendless conspiracies, treasons, massacres, and battles which fill the\r\nnarrative of Briggs's Ferishta might not have happened in the Deccan\r\nat all, for all the change they have effected in the institutions and\r\ncustoms of the bulk of the population. The Ballootadar still holds the\r\nsame office which was filled by his ancestor centuries ago, performs\r\nthe same service, and receives the same perquisites. The cultivator\r\nuses the same implements, raises the same crops in the same way, and\r\npractises the same customs. As it was centuries ago, so it is now;\r\nnothing is changed, and these time-honoured institutions continue to be\r\nadmirably adapted to the simple wants and habits of the people who live\r\nunder them. These Deccanees now enjoy their land for a very trifling\r\nassessment unalterable for thirty years, their means are sufficient to\r\nsupply themselves and their families with all they require in the way\r\nof clothing and furniture, they have a considerable variety in their\r\nfood, days of relaxation and festivity are not of rare occurrence,\r\ntheir immediate superiors are of their own race and religion, and there\r\nis little to remind them of the presence of foreign rulers. On the\r\nwhole, in their own simple way, they probably enjoy as much happiness\r\nas the peasantry of most other countries in the world, while their\r\nwants are fewer and their desires more easily attainable.\r\n\r\nIn the country between Shirwul and Poona the harvest had already been\r\nreaped when we crossed it. In one or two places there were avenues of\r\nmango-trees by the road-side, but generally the country was bare and\r\ntreeless. The great city of Poona, once the seat of Mahratta power,\r\nstill retains the signs of its former splendour. In the narrow crowded\r\nstreets there are many large houses of two stories, with much richly\r\ncarved wood about the balconies and doorways, and frescos painted\r\non the walls of Gods and Goddesses, and scenes in the lives of the\r\nPandus or of Krishna. The bazar is generally thronged with Brahmins,\r\nMoslems, Lingayets, Bohrahs, Parsees, men, women, and children, while\r\nthe shops are occupied by silversmiths, workers in copper, brass, and\r\nwood; sellers of grains, drugs, oils, and ingredients for curries; of\r\nsweetmeats, of cloths, of blue and green bangles for women, and of\r\nendless other wares. The temples are numerous, but none of them are\r\nremarkable either for size or beauty. The old palace of the Peishwas\r\nforms one side of an open space, and is surrounded by a high wall with\r\nsemicircular bastions. The entrance is by an archway, flanked on either\r\nside by solid Norman-looking towers, with a balcony over it, extending\r\nfrom one tower to the other, from which the young Peishwa Mahadeo Rao\r\nthrew himself in 1795.\r\n\r\nIn 1773 the Peishwa Narrain Rao was murdered in this gloomy-looking\r\ncastle by his uncle Ragonath Rao, and many another deed of darkness has\r\nbeen done within its walls.\r\n\r\nLeaving the town, we drove past the _Hira Bagh_ or \"diamond garden,\"\r\nwhere there is a large tank with a wooded island in the centre, to the\r\nfoot of the rocky hill of Parbutty, on the summit of which there is a\r\ntemple to Siva. The ascent is by a well-cut flight of steps, and the\r\ntemple,[497] which crowns the hill, is surrounded by a wall of very\r\nsolid masonry, with a covered gallery having quaintly carved wooden\r\nbalconies, and an open rampart above. From one of these balconies Bajee\r\nRao, the last of the Peishwas, watched the defeat of his army at Kirkee\r\nin 1817; when Poona, and all its territory, became an integral part of\r\nBritish India.\r\n\r\nThe view from the Parbutty hill is very extensive. At our feet was\r\nthe _Hira Bagh_, with its broad sheet of water, and numerous groves\r\nof trees; beyond was the great city almost hidden by trees, the roofs\r\nof houses showing here and there, but no conspicuous towers or lofty\r\nbuilding. Further still we could see the windings of the rivers Mula\r\nand Muta, tributaries of the Krishna. To the left was the village of\r\nKirkee, and to the right the churches, numerous bungalows, and other\r\nbuildings of the English cantonment. At this time of year the whole\r\nmass of buildings and gardens forming and mingling with the city\r\nand cantonment, is surrounded by brown dried-up plains, and rocky\r\narid-looking mountains, which furnish a sombre frame to the picture.\r\n\r\nThis magnificent view was exceedingly interesting, because it seemed\r\nmore than probable that, in a not far distant future, the city of Poona\r\nmight become the capital of British India--the seat of Government of a\r\nvast Empire, united for the first time in history under one firm and\r\nbeneficent rule, enjoying a universal peace unknown for centuries, and\r\nrapidly advancing in material prosperity. Calcutta must be given up\r\nas the most distant from England, the least conveniently situated as\r\nregards other parts of India, and the most unhealthy place that could\r\nbe selected for a capital. This point once granted, the old Mahratta\r\ncapital recommends itself as combining all the advantages in which\r\nthe pestiferous banks of the Hooghly are deficient. Poona is within\r\na few hours' journey of the port of Bombay by railroad; situated on\r\nan elevated table-land, its climate is healthy and suitable both for\r\nEuropeans and natives; and it is in a central position as regards all\r\nthe Presidencies of India.\r\n\r\nThe railroad from Poona to Bombay stopped at Khandalla, on the summit\r\nof the Bhore ghaut, where a portion of it is still unfinished. The\r\nvillage of Khandalla is perched on the edge of a deep chasm, mountains\r\nrise up into sharp peaks to the right and left, and there is a very\r\nextensive view over the Concan plains. Here the passengers had to get\r\nout of the train, and go down the ghaut by the excellent road made by\r\nSir John Malcolm, in bullock-_gharries_ or in _palkees_, on ponies or\r\non foot. The works of the railway were, however, progressing fast; and\r\nwhen finished, the railroad up the Bhore ghaut will be one of the most\r\nremarkable works of the kind in the world. The station at Khandalla is\r\n1800 feet, and Kampuli, at the foot of the ghaut, barely 200 feet above\r\nthe sea. For a distance of 220 miles there are no passes for wheeled\r\nvehicles from Bombay to the interior, except the Bhore and Tal ghauts,\r\nso precipitous is the volcanic scarp which forms this portion of the\r\nwestern mountains.\r\n\r\nThe railroad incline down the Bhore ghaut is upwards of fifteen miles\r\nlong, the rise being 1831 feet, and the average gradient 1 in 48.\r\nIn this distance there will be 2535 yards of tunnelling, besides an\r\nimmense amount of cutting and embanking, eight viaducts, and eighteen\r\nbridges. The best known work of this kind in Europe is at Semmering,\r\nacross the Noric Alps; but that of the Bhore ghaut exceeds it in\r\nlength, in height, and in the steepness of the gradient.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the Bhore ghaut is the village of Kampuli, whence the\r\nrailroad runs across the plains of the Concan, over an arm of the sea,\r\npast Tannah, and through the island of Salsette, into the town of\r\nBombay.\r\n\r\nI had now personally examined the Neilgherry hills, the Koondahs, the\r\nPulneys, Coorg, and the Mahabaleshwurs; and collected information\r\nrespecting the hills near Courtallum, the Anamallays, the Shervaroys,\r\nWynaad, the Baba-Bodeens, and Nuggur. After a careful consideration of\r\nthe conditions which each of these districts offer, and a comparison of\r\ntheir elevations, climate, soil, and the character of their vegetation,\r\nwith those of the South American chinchona forests; I was fully\r\nconfirmed in the opinion that the mountains of the Indian peninsula\r\noffered a splendid field for the cultivation of this new and most\r\nvaluable product.\r\n\r\nThe different species thrive in different localities, and require\r\nvarious modes of treatment, but I am inclined to the belief that one\r\nspecies or another will thrive in all the hills from Cape Comorin to\r\nthe parallel of 14° N. This view may prove to be too sanguine, and it\r\nmay be that the droughts at one season, and the excessive rainfall\r\nin another, in several of the hill districts, will prove prejudicial\r\nto successful cultivation. Under any circumstances, however, there\r\ncan be no doubt that the climates of the Neilgherries, Anamallays,\r\nPulneys, and probably Coorg, are admirably adapted to the production\r\nof quinine in these precious trees. On the other hand, it is possible\r\nthat, under cultivation, the chinchonæ may be able to adapt themselves\r\nto conditions of climate differing as much from those of their native\r\nhabitat even as the Mahabaleshwur hills, and that their cultivation\r\nis capable of far wider extension than I am now able to expect. It\r\nwould be a source of gratification if chinchona plantations could\r\nbe established in any part of the Bombay Presidency; and while Mr.\r\nDalzell, the able Conservator of forests, superintends any experiments\r\nwhich may be made, it will certainly not be from a want of botanical\r\nknowledge or intelligent care, if his anticipations of success are not\r\nrealised.[498]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n  CULTIVATION OF THE CHINCHONA-PLANTS IN THE NEILGHERRY HILLS, UNDER THE\r\n  SUPERINTENDENCE OF MR. McIVOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN previous chapters detailed accounts have been given of the\r\nproceedings connected with the collection of chinchona plants and seeds\r\nin South America, their conveyance to India, and the selection of\r\nsuitable sites for their cultivation. It now only remains to record the\r\nprogress of this important experiment in the Neilgherry hills during\r\nthe last year, and to offer some remarks on the contemplated measures\r\nconnected with its future management. A very valuable Report by Mr.\r\nMcIvor, on the same subject, will be found in an Appendix.\r\n\r\nIt is a subject of congratulation that the Government should have at\r\ntheir disposal the services of one so admirably fitted for the post\r\nof Director of chinchona cultivation as Mr. McIvor. This gentleman\r\nhas superintended the Government gardens at Ootacamund for fourteen\r\nyears, and their beauty as well as their usefulness are due to\r\nhim;[499] while his periodical visits to the Conolly teak plantations\r\nhave been productive of the most valuable results,[500] and he has\r\nsuccessfully introduced a great number of English and other plants into\r\nthe Neilgherry hills.[501] Mr. McIvor combines with his attainments\r\nas a scientific gardener great practical experience, and a thorough\r\nacquaintance with the climates, soils, and flora of the hills. He has\r\nlong taken a deep interest in the question of the introduction of\r\nchinchona-plants into India, and he brought the subject to the notice\r\nof Lord Harris, then Governor of Madras, as long ago as 1855. Since\r\nthat time he has made himself master of the subject by a study of every\r\nwork of any importance which has appeared in Europe within the last\r\nthirty years;[502] while the practical knowledge which he has acquired\r\nof the requirements of chinchona-plants during the fifteen months that\r\nhe has now superintended their cultivation, in addition to his previous\r\nqualifications, makes him fitter than any other person that could be\r\nfound for the direction of this most important experiment.\r\n\r\nIn July 1861 Mr. McIvor was appointed Superintendent of chinchona\r\ncultivation by the Madras Government, with full and entire control\r\nover the operations, in direct communication with the Government,\r\nand subject to no interference from any intermediate authority.[503]\r\nOrders to the same effect were sent out to Madras by the Secretary of\r\nState for India in Council on July 2nd, 1861, and the same orders were\r\nrepeated both to the Governor-General and to the Governor of Madras,\r\nin despatches dated February 1862. It was above all things important\r\nthat Mr. McIvor's position, in connexion with the chinchona experiment,\r\nshould be authoritatively defined, in order to protect him from\r\nattempts at interference, which have been as vexatious as they have\r\nbeen unnecessary, and which have more than once threatened to render\r\nsuccess impossible. These dangers are now, fortunately, at an end; and\r\nthe interest taken by Sir William Denison, the present Governor of\r\nMadras, in a measure calculated to confer so great a benefit on the\r\npeople of India, ensures to it a fair trial, and is one of the best\r\nguarantees of ultimate success.\r\n\r\nMr. McIvor's zeal and ability, his intimate knowledge of his\r\nprofession, of the Neilgherry hills, and of all questions bearing on\r\nthe subject of chinchona-plants, and his acquirements as a scientific\r\nas well as a practical gardener, justify the confidence which has\r\nthus been placed in him by the Secretary of State in Council, and\r\nby the Madras Government. He has also had the advantage of personal\r\nintercourse, for weeks together, with Mr. Cross, Mr. Weir, and myself,\r\nafter we had explored and carefully examined the chinchona forests in\r\nSouth America; but his subsequent experience in the cultivation of the\r\nplants under his charge has furnished him with means of observation\r\nwhich now gives his opinion greater weight than those of persons whose\r\nknowledge is derived from books, from short visits to the plantations\r\nin Java, or even from personal examination of the South American\r\nforests.\r\n\r\nIn offering my opinion on the best method of cultivating the\r\nchinchona-plants, I have the satisfaction of knowing that my\r\nconclusions substantially agree with those of Mr. McIvor--mine being\r\nfounded on experience gained in the chinchona forests, and his on\r\ncareful observation of the plants which he has reared in India. That\r\nthese views should be concurred in by Dr. Weddell, Mr. Howard, and Mr.\r\nSpruce, is most satisfactory, as it supplies an additional presumption\r\nof their correctness.\r\n\r\nI will now proceed to give an account of the progress of the chinchona\r\ncultivation in the Neilgherry hills. The first batch of seeds, being\r\nthose of the \"grey-bark\" species from Huanuco, arrived at Ootacamund\r\non the 13th of January, 1861, and those of the \"red-bark\" followed in\r\nthe end of February. On the 7th of April 463 plants of _C. succirubra_\r\nand six of _C. Calisaya_ reached their destination on the Neilgherry\r\nhills in very good condition, considering the length of time they had\r\nbeen in Wardian cases, and thus the experiment was fairly commenced.\r\n\r\nThe first sowing, which took place in January, was not very successful,\r\nbecause Mr. McIvor was induced to use too retentive a soil, having been\r\nmisled by the treatment of seeds adopted in Java; and only 3 to 4 per\r\ncent. germinated. The second sowing took place early in March, the soil\r\nused being of a much freer nature, half composed of burned earth; and\r\n15 to 25 per cent. germinated. Encouraged by this result, Mr. McIvor\r\nused a soil composed entirely of burned earth for the third sowing,\r\nwhich took place in the beginning of April, and included the seeds of\r\nthe \"red-bark\" species. Of this sowing 60 per cent. germinated, and\r\nof the seeds of _C. micrantha_ 90 per cent. It is to be remembered\r\nthat all these seeds were collected in the South American forests some\r\nmonths before, and that they had passed through the perils of several\r\nclimates, and a voyage of many thousands of miles.\r\n\r\nIn May all the plants of _C. succirubra_ had taken fairly to the\r\nsoil, and were in a healthy and flourishing condition, those of _C.\r\nCalisaya_ were doing well, but recovering more slowly from the effects\r\nof the voyage, and the seedlings were growing fast. The temperature\r\ngiven to the plants was 60° in the morning, rising to 75° in the day,\r\nwith plenty of light and air; this treatment having proved to be best\r\nadapted for their rapid growth. Of course they would grow higher if\r\nshaded, and consequently drawn up, according to the erroneous plan\r\nadopted in Java; but this is not what is wanted, and, by giving them\r\nplenty of light and air, they grew into fine strong plants, as broad as\r\nthey were long.\r\n\r\nIt was found that the chinchonæ are remarkably impatient of any damp at\r\ntheir roots, all the species thrive better in rough and open than in\r\nfine soil, and there is reason to believe that they will bear a much\r\ndrier climate than we originally supposed.\r\n\r\nDuring the autumn of 1861 the work of propagation, by means of cuttings\r\nand layers, progressed rapidly; and, whereas in June 1861 we only had\r\n2114 chinchona-plants of valuable species at Ootacamund, in January\r\nthe number was increased to 9732 plants. The layers of _C. succirubra_\r\nroot sufficiently to be removed in five weeks, and cuttings in two\r\nmonths; layers of the \"grey-bark\" taking a little longer time to root,\r\nor about six weeks. Mr. McIvor has also made the important discovery\r\nthat chinchonæ strike freely from _eyes_, and make beautiful plants\r\nexactly like strong seedlings. These _eyes_ will give about eight fine\r\nstrong plants for one that is obtained from cuttings, which is a great\r\nadvantage while there is not much wood in the young plants. In October\r\nMr. McIvor reduced the temperature of one of the propagating houses\r\nto 55° at night, and 65° during the day; and, under this treatment,\r\nwhich is also probably advantageous to the bark, the plants appeared\r\nto grow faster, and the leaves became a very beautiful bright green.\r\nThe thickness of the bark, in the plants of _C. succirubra_, is very\r\nremarkable, having been in some instances nearly one-seventh of an\r\ninch last January, and in the smaller stems the average thickness of\r\nthe bark considerably exceeds that of the wood. Mr. McIvor attributes\r\nthe unusual thickness of the bark to the presence of a large number of\r\nhealthy leaves, exposed to bright light. These leaves throw back into\r\nthe bark a large quantity of highly elaborated matter. The experience\r\nof a year's cultivation convinced Mr. McIvor that, although the most\r\nsuitable elevation and climate differs with the various species, yet\r\nthat they all require a rich, rough, and very open soil. In September\r\nthe erection of a new propagating house for chinchona-plants, in the\r\nGovernment gardens at Ootacamund, was sanctioned, which was completed\r\nearly in December. It is 63 feet long by 21 broad, and will hold about\r\n8000 plants.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch Government in Java, at the request of the Government of\r\nIndia, arranged to forward some chinchona-plants of the species\r\ncultivated in that island to Calcutta; and accordingly 100 of _C.\r\nCalisaya_, 300 of _C. Pahudiana_, and 7 of _C. lancifolia_ were\r\ntransmitted. Of these 48 of _C. Calisaya_, 4 of _C. lancifolia_, and\r\n250 of _C. Pahudiana_ arrived at Ootacamund on the 20th of December,\r\n1861. In exchange for these plants a supply of _C. succirubræ_, and a\r\nproportionate number of the other species, will be sent to Java, \"not\r\nmore in return for the valuable accession actually received to our\r\nstock of plants of _C. Calisaya_, than in acknowledgment of the very\r\ncourteous and liberal spirit evinced by the Dutch authorities.\"[504] At\r\nabout the same time Mr. McIvor also sent 100 plants of _C. succirubra_\r\nand 50 of each of the \"grey-bark\" species to Calcutta, with a view to\r\nthe establishment of a chinchona plantation in the Sikkim or Bhotan\r\nhills.\r\n\r\nThe plants which arrived from Java were drawn and weak, and had\r\nevidently been grown without sufficient light. They were all more or\r\nless affected by rot at their roots, and many of the roots were covered\r\nwith fungi. A few of the plants of _C. Calisaya_ died, but the others\r\nrecovered under Mr. McIvor's watchful care.\r\n\r\nA large parcel of seeds of _C. Condaminea_, probably of two varieties\r\n(_Chahuarguera_ and _Uritusinga_), and a smaller packet of seeds of\r\n_C. crispa_, were despatched from England in January, and arrived at\r\nOotacamund in March, 1862. By this time Mr. McIvor had discovered the\r\nbest method of treatment for chinchona-seeds. He sows in very sandy\r\nsoil; and while so much water is never given as to make the particles\r\nof soil adhere to each other, yet the soil is kept in a uniform\r\nmedium state of moisture. In this way the seeds not only germinate\r\nsoon, but come up very strong. There is every reason to expect that a\r\ngood per-centage of these seeds will germinate,[505] and that a large\r\nnumber of these, the earliest known of all the valuable chinchona\r\nspecies, will soon be growing luxuriantly in the upper _sholas_ of the\r\nNeilgherry hills. Mr. Howard has also presented the Government with a\r\nplant of _C. Uritusinga_ of Pavon (_C. Condaminea_, H. and B.), six\r\nfeet high, which he had raised from seed sent to him from Loxa. This\r\nprecious plant was embarked on board the steamer on the 4th of March,\r\n1862, and arrived at Ootacamund early in April.\r\n\r\nThus, after two anxious years, we now have all the valuable species\r\nof chinchonæ mentioned in the second chapter, safely established in\r\nSouthern India. In the following tabular statement will be seen at a\r\nglance the number of species, the number of each species, the number of\r\nplants last February, their monthly increase since June, their monthly\r\ngrowth, and their present dimensions. The number is now increasing at\r\nthe rate of several thousands every month. The imported plants of _C.\r\nsuccirubra_ have already produced some thousands by propagation; and in\r\nDecember the seedlings had attained a size sufficient to give wood for\r\npropagation, the first of them having even then produced a few hundred\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nFrom the total number of 10,157 chinchona-plants must be deducted 425\r\nof the worthless _C. Pahudiana_ sent from Java, leaving a total of 9732\r\nof valuable species on the 1st of February, with the number rapidly\r\nincreasing. The increase was not so large as it otherwise would have\r\nbeen during the first two months of 1862, owing to the supply of a\r\nnumber of plants to Java, and the transmission of others to Calcutta,\r\nwith a view to the formation of a plantation in the Bengal hills, and\r\nof sixteen to Mr. Maltby for the Rajah of Travancore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONTHLY REPORTS of the Number and Growth of the\r\nCHINCHONA PLANTS on the Neilgherry Hills.[506]]\r\n\r\nIt is exceedingly satisfactory to compare these results with those\r\nof the Dutch cultivators in Java. After _six_ years they only had\r\n(exclusive of the _C. Pahudiana_, which is quite worthless) 8454\r\nchinchona-plants of valuable species;[507] whereas in rather less\r\nthan _one_ year Mr. McIvor has reared 9732, without counting several\r\nhundreds which he has transmitted to Java, Calcutta, and Travancore.\r\nThe Dutch have only introduced _two_ good species, while we have\r\nobtained _nine_, exclusive of the four plants of _C. lancifolia_\r\npresented by the Dutch authorities. Thus, the average increase of\r\nvaluable species of _chinchona_-plants in Java between 1854 and 1860\r\nbeing at the rate of 1409 a year, the results attained in India have\r\nbeen nearly seven times as great as those of the Dutch cultivators.\r\nThese facts are not mentioned in any spirit of undue exultation, but in\r\norder to show that it is not advisable slavishly to follow the methods\r\nof cultivation adopted by the Dutch, as two gentlemen, in official\r\npositions, who have recently visited the plantations in Java, appear to\r\nimagine. On the contrary, a system of cultivation diametrically opposed\r\nto that of the Dutch has enabled Mr. McIvor to achieve his present\r\nsuccess; and the sites for plantations have been selected and prepared,\r\nnot with any reference to the erroneous and comparatively unsuccessful\r\nsystems pursued in Java, but on the principle of carefully comparing\r\nthe elevations, temperature, amount of humidity, and of exposure of the\r\nmountains where the different valuable species of chinchona thrive in\r\nSouth America, with analogous situations in the hills of Southern India.\r\n\r\nThe important process of planting out has now commenced in the\r\nNeilgherry hills, and it has been a subject of careful consideration\r\nwhether the chinchona-plants should be grown under dense shade, under\r\nthe partial shade of forest-trees, or quite in the open: in other\r\nwords--what are the elevations and amounts of exposure best suited to\r\nthe growth of the plants, and the development of their alkaloids?\r\n\r\nIn Java the chinchona-plants were at first established at far too low\r\nan elevation, in a wretched soil, and exposed to the full glare of\r\nthe sun. Dr. Junghuhn, the present Superintendent, went to the other\r\nextreme, and, though the proper elevation has been ascertained, yet\r\nthe error has been committed of forming the plantations in the dense\r\nshade of the forest, with the intention of allowing some trees to be\r\ndrawn up in search of light, without a branch for thirty or forty feet,\r\nand of cutting them down for their bark in about forty years, and of\r\ngrubbing up others in search of imaginary quinine in their roots.[508]\r\nI understand that this plan has at last been found to be erroneous,\r\nand that Dr. Junghuhn now directs all the trees in the vicinity of the\r\nchinchona-plants to be cut down, though faith is still maintained in\r\nthe quinine-yielding roots of the worthless _C. Pahudiana_.[509]\r\n\r\nIf the thing was not sufficiently evident in itself, the appearance of\r\nthe barks sent from Java to the Exhibition of 1862 is quite enough to\r\nprove that chinchona-plants ought not to be cultivated under the shade\r\nof forest-trees. The question of the proper amount of exposure to which\r\neach species should be subjected is, however, one which requires very\r\ncareful consideration; as upon its correct solution depends the most\r\nimportant point of all, namely the method of cultivation which will\r\nbe most profitable, and most suitable to the operations of private\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nMr. McIvor commenced experiments in planting out in the spring of 1861.\r\nIn April he planted out three plants of _C. succirubra_, two under\r\nshade, and one in an open spot surrounded by brushwood and undergrowth.\r\nOn the 29th of the same month the S.W. monsoon set in, and the plants\r\nunder dense shade assumed a weak climber-like habit, and were injured\r\nfrom the leaves being cut to pieces by the constant drip from the\r\nforest-trees;[510] while the plant shaded by the brushwood continued\r\nin the most luxuriant state of health, with its leaves uninjured. In\r\nSeptember 1861, six plants of different species were planted out in\r\ncleared spots on the highest and most exposed points of the Neddiwuttum\r\nsite, and all of these have not only borne the cold and drought without\r\ninjury, but their growth has never even been checked, and at present\r\nthey are in the finest possible state of health. Their leaves are of\r\nthe deepest green, some of them measuring 12 inches by 9.\r\n\r\nBetween May and August fifteen \"red-bark\" plants were planted out at\r\nOotacamund. The unusual cold of December checked the growth of these\r\nplants, but did not injure them in the least, and the leaves still keep\r\ntheir deep-green colour, and measure from 7 to 9 inches.[511]\r\n\r\nEarly in January 1862, the formation of a nursery was commenced at\r\nNeddiwuttum, large enough for 300,000 or 400,000 Chinchonæ; and 2400\r\nwere planted out. 150 acres are to be planted, at the Neddiwuttum\r\nsite, during the year; of which 75 acres will be planted under\r\nvarious degrees of shade from forest-trees, in order to ascertain\r\nthe results of this method by actual experiment; and 75 quite in the\r\nopen, the young plants being protected from the direct rays of the sun\r\nby artificial shade during the first year or two. The original stock\r\nwill be retained in the gardens at Ootacamund, for the purpose of\r\npropagation, and the propagated plants will be used for stocking the\r\nnurseries and plantations.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the question of whether the chinchonæ should be planted\r\nout in dense shade of forest-trees or in the open, it will be well to\r\nrecapitulate some of the information which has been collected in their\r\nnative habitat in South America.\r\n\r\nIn the forests of Caravaya I observed that the plants of _C. Calisaya_,\r\nwhen in dense shade, were tall and weak, with few branches, and without\r\nany sign of ever having flowered or fruited. When very slightly shaded,\r\nas on the ridge of rocks above the Yanamayu, or scarcely at all, as\r\non the precipice of Ccasa-sani, they spread more, have a more healthy\r\nappearance, and are covered with capsule-bearing panicles; while the\r\nmost thriving and healthy-looking young plant that I met with, was\r\ngrowing in the open, without any shade whatever. It is quite certain\r\nthat an abundance of light and air is an absolute necessity for the\r\nfull development of the alkaloids in the bark of _C. Calisaya_, and\r\nthat the trees must either grow at the edge of the forests, or else\r\nfind their way to the light, by overtopping all other trees: otherwise,\r\nas is too often the case, they assume a weakly, straggling habit under\r\nthe baneful influence of dense shade.\r\n\r\nDr. Weddell is of opinion that, during the first year or two, the soil\r\nand trunks of young trees of _C. Calisaya_ should be protected from the\r\ndirect influence of the scorching sun, as he had observed that plants\r\nso exposed generally appeared to have a stunted growth. He refers of\r\ncourse to the _Josephiana_ or shrub variety of _C. Calisaya_, but their\r\ndwarfed habit must be attributed to the less fertile soil of the open\r\ngrass-land in which they grow, and partly also to the great altitude,\r\nand consequently cold climate, rather than to effects of exposure to\r\nlight and air.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the \"red-bark\" species, there cannot be a doubt\r\nthat they should be planted in the open. On this point Mr. Spruce's\r\nobservations are quite conclusive. He says--\"The trees standing in\r\nopen ground, pasture, cane-field, &c., are far healthier and more\r\nluxuriant than those growing in the forest, where they are hemmed in\r\nand partially shaded by other trees; and while many of the former had\r\nflowered freely, the latter were, without exception, sterile. This\r\nplainly shows that, although the red-bark may need shade whilst young\r\nand tender, it really requires (like most trees) plenty of air, light,\r\nand room, wherein to develop its proportions.\"[512]\r\n\r\nThe \"grey-bark\" species all bear the marks of exposure to free air,\r\ncold, and sunshine; and the overspreading thallus of various _Grapideæ_\r\non their barks indicates that the trees have grown in open situations,\r\nexposed to rain and sunshine.[513]\r\n\r\nThe _C. Condaminea_ trees, in the neighbourhood of Loxa, grow\r\nsometimes in little clumps, and sometimes solitary, but always in dry\r\nsituations.[514] Dr. Seemann, who visited Loxa when serving on board\r\nH.M.S. Herald, informs me that those which he saw, bearing ripe fruit,\r\nwere on the edge of thickets, entirely exposed to the influence of air\r\nand sunshine.\r\n\r\nDr. Weddell assures me that he would never recommend that any of the\r\nchinchona-trees should be planted in the dense shade of the forest,\r\nas in such a situation the greater number would evidently soon be\r\nsmothered. He is of opinion that the Chinchonæ, in India, should be\r\nplanted in open ground; but he considers it important that the trunks\r\nand soil should be shaded during the first year or two. He proposes\r\nto effect this object either by planting the chinchonas at convenient\r\ndistances in a quincunx, alternately with some more fast-growing trees,\r\nwhich might be cut away when no longer required;[515] or by planting\r\nthe chinchonas themselves close enough to oblige each other to run up,\r\nsufficient space and air being gradually provided by judicious pruning\r\nand thinning out. The former method might be a good one if it were\r\nnot for the faster-growing trees taking up a great proportion of the\r\nnourishment from the soil, which would be more profitably reserved for\r\nthe chinchonas; and probably the efficient shading of the trees, while\r\nyoung and tender, will be more easily and effectually provided for by\r\nsimple artificial means.\r\n\r\nMr. Howard, the author of '_Nueva Quinologia de Pavon_,' whose\r\nknowledge on all questions connected with chinchona-plants is not\r\nsurpassed by that of any botanist in Europe, is clearly of opinion that\r\nthey should be planted in the open, without shade from other trees,\r\nand that they should be cultivated as shrubs; when their branches will\r\nyield an ample and remunerative supply of bark.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Dr. Junghuhn, in Java, has planted his chinchonæ\r\nunder the dense shade of forest-trees, where they must necessarily\r\nbe watery and unhealthy, where they will not flower or bear fruit,\r\nand where he does not expect that they will yield quinine for fifty\r\nyears, when he contemplates the entire demolition of the plantations\r\nby felling all the trees. Now, if such a system as this is to be\r\nadopted in India, the chinchona-plants might as well never have been\r\nintroduced. The plantations would be a wasteful expense to Government,\r\nwith a remote chance of some profit, forming but a small fraction\r\nof the outlay, about twice in a century; and the idea of chinchona\r\ncultivation ever being undertaken by private enterprise, on this\r\nsystem, is quite out of the question; for what planter in his senses\r\nwould commence the cultivation of a product which would yield him no\r\nreturn for forty or fifty years?\r\n\r\nWhen planted in the open chinchonæ grow luxuriantly, yield abundant\r\nsupplies of seed, and form fine thick bark, which, owing to the free\r\nexposure of the leaves to the influence of light and fresh air,\r\ncontains a large per-centage of alkaloids; while, in the shade of\r\nforest-trees, they run up into tall, weak, straggling plants, with\r\nlittle chance of either bearing fruit, or elaborating much quinine in\r\ntheir bark, until, after nearly half a century, some of them at length\r\novertop the other trees, and reach that essential sunshine of which\r\nthey had been so long deprived.\r\n\r\nI not only think, with Mr. Spruce, Dr. Weddell, Mr. Howard, Mr. McIvor,\r\nand Mr. Cross, that the chinchona-plants must be planted in the open,\r\nand freely exposed to the influence of fresh air and sunshine; but I am\r\nmost strongly of opinion that, if the opposite system was unfortunately\r\nadopted, it would have been far better if the expense and trouble of\r\nintroducing these precious trees into India had never been incurred.\r\n\r\nIt is true that, when planted in the forest, the chinchonæ will\r\nlook well to the casual observer, and that their cultivation can be\r\nconducted without skill or care, as all will be left to nature; while,\r\nin open ground, it will require great skill and constant attention to\r\nget the young trees over the first year or two. The cleared ground\r\nwill be exposed to the full effects of evaporation and radiation, and\r\nmuch judicious management will be necessary in applying artificial\r\nshade, and in adopting other precautions. The open spaces should not, I\r\nthink, be of very great extent, without being broken up by clumps or\r\nirregular lines of trees; and care must be taken that the supplies of\r\nmoisture and of water are not prejudiced by too much felling. But these\r\ndetails may safely be left to Mr. McIvor, who now has the assistance of\r\ntwo well-instructed English gardeners, named Batcock and Lyall; and he\r\nwill be able to obtain uniform and constant yearly supplies of bark,\r\nwithout any damage to the trees, which, when once full-grown, will\r\nthrive luxuriantly, and yield abundance of seeds.\r\n\r\nThe most suitable positions for chinchona-plants, as regards elevation\r\nand climate, having been pointed out, and the best method of treatment\r\nwith respect to exposure being decided in favour of planting out in\r\nopen ground, two other questions remain to be discussed which are\r\nintimately connected with the above,--namely, the conditions under\r\nwhich the largest per-centage of febrifugal alkaloids will be formed in\r\nthe bark,[516] and the method of cultivation which is likely to yield\r\nthe largest and most remunerative supplies of bark in the shortest time.\r\n\r\nOne well-established fact, which is proved by universal experience,\r\nis that all the species of chinchona-trees produce the thickest bark\r\nand the largest per-centage of alkaloids when growing at the highest\r\nelevation at which they respectively flourish. Thus, all other\r\ncircumstances being favourable, the _C. Calisaya_ and _C. succirubra_\r\nspecies will yield more profitable crops when growing at an elevation\r\nof 6000 feet, than at one of 5000 feet. The shrubby varieties of\r\nchinchonæ are specially good when their stunted growth is owing to the\r\naltitude of the locality.[517] Mr. Spruce ascertained, with regard to\r\nthe \"red bark,\" that the greater the height at which the tree grows,\r\nthe larger is the proportion of alkaloids contained in the bark;[518]\r\nand that, although the trees growing nearest the plain were generally\r\nmuch larger, yet their bark was by no means so thick in proportion to\r\ntheir diameter as in trees higher up. He adds that, in cutting down\r\ntrees in the hot plains, he has often been struck with the thinness of\r\nthe bark compared to that of trees growing in temperate climates.[519]\r\n\r\nThere are several other conditions under which the largest amount\r\nof alkaloids is formed in chinchona-barks, which are as yet little\r\nunderstood. Dr. Karsten suggests that the content of alkaloids in\r\nthe same species of chinchona-trees, growing in different ravines,\r\nis affected by unceasing mists in one, and constant sunshine resting\r\non the vegetation in the other; the former impeding, and the latter\r\npromoting, the formation of quinine.[520] In the Loxa region a great\r\ndifference has been noticed in the bark of _C. Condaminea_, according\r\nas the tree has grown on the sides of the mountains most exposed to\r\nthe rays of the morning or of the evening sun: and Mr. Spruce remarks\r\nof the \"red-bark\" trees that the ridges on which they grow all deviate\r\nfrom an easterly and westerly direction, and that the trees are far\r\nmore abundant on their northern than on their southern slopes. The\r\nnorthern and eastern sides of the trees had also borne most flowers,\r\nand scarcely a capsule ripened on their southern and western sides,\r\nexcept on one tree of more open growth than the rest. This phenomenon\r\nis due to the fact that the trees receive more sunshine from the north\r\nand east, during the summer mornings,[521] the afternoons being usually\r\nfoggy.\r\n\r\nAll these points will receive careful attention from Mr. McIvor, in\r\nconducting the cultivation; and his observations will soon enable him\r\nto decide many points connected with the formation of quinine in the\r\nbark, and to ascertain the most advantageous conditions under which the\r\nplants should be cultivated.\r\n\r\nThe sites have been selected at Neddiwuttum and Dodabetta with\r\nreference to the similarity of elevation and climate in those\r\nlocalities to the native mountains of the species which it is intended\r\nto cultivate in them, and because they have plenty of deep loamy soil.\r\nIt has also been determined that the best method of cultivation will be\r\nfound in planting out the chinchonæ in the open, for reasons already\r\ngiven; and not only will the luxuriant and healthy growth of the\r\nplants be provided for by this treatment, but it is also essential for\r\nthe formation of an abundant supply of alkaloids in their bark. This\r\nprocess depends on the vigorous action of the leaves, and the healthful\r\ncondition of the leaves is due to a sufficient supply of sunshine. Dr.\r\nLindley says,--\"It is to the action of leaves,--to the decomposition\r\nof their carbonic acid, and of their water; to the separation of the\r\naqueous particles of the sap from the solid parts that were dissolved\r\nin it; to the deposition thus effected of various earthy and other\r\nsubstances, either introduced into plants as silex or metallic salts,\r\nor formed there, as the vegetable alkaloids; to the extrication of\r\nnitrogen; and, probably, to other causes as yet unknown--that the\r\nformation of the peculiar secretions of plants, of whatever kind, is\r\nowing. And this is brought about principally, if not exclusively, by\r\nthe agency of light. Their green colour becomes intense, in proportion\r\nto their exposure to light within certain limits.\"[522]\r\n\r\nUnder cultivation the chinchona-plants must either be raised in their\r\nshrubby form in the open, or as tall trees under the shade of the\r\nforest. The latter system, which has been adopted by Dr. Junghuhn in\r\nJava, is defended on the ground that, in their natural localities in\r\nthe Andes, the chinchonæ \"grow in damp forests overshadowed by trees.\"\r\nThere are two things to be said against this. Firstly, that it is not\r\nthe case; for though it is true that some species of chinchonæ do grow\r\nin damp shady forests, yet they never flourish in such positions, but\r\nonly when supplied with plenty of light and air; and secondly, even if\r\nit was the case, such an argument would be worth nothing. In their wild\r\nstate, and in localities where they are indigenous, all plants find\r\ncertain conditions which are favourable to their perfect development;\r\nbut they have to struggle for existence with a multitude of neighbours.\r\nEvery condition is not supplied by Providence for the special behoof\r\nof one particular genus, and, in virgin forests, all trees suffer more\r\nor less from being overcrowded and overshadowed. But under cultivation\r\nthe case is different. The cultivator endeavours to combine all the\r\nconditions best calculated to ensure the perfect development of a\r\nparticular plant, and does not subject it to the baneful influences of\r\ntoo much shade, merely because it suffered from overshading in its wild\r\nstate. Mr. McIvor has very aptly illustrated this point, by mentioning\r\nthat Bruce found wheat growing wild in Upper Egypt, struggling for\r\nexistence with rushes and other weeds. An English farmer would be\r\nsurprised if he was told to sow his wheat in the hedges, instead of in\r\nthe fields, because in its wild state it is found amongst weeds and\r\nbriars!\r\n\r\nThe facts that it will be necessary to wait for thirty years before any\r\nreturn can be expected; and that it will have a most injurious effect\r\non the formation of alkaloids in the bark, are sufficient arguments\r\nagainst planting the chinchonæ in the shade of the forest, and waiting\r\nfor them to run up until the survivors overtop the surrounding trees.\r\nIt has been necessary to bring these points prominently forward,\r\nbecause attempts have been made to introduce the erroneous system,\r\nadopted by the Dutch cultivators, into India.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the other alternative, that of raising the chinchonæ in\r\ntheir shrubby form, on plantations in open clearings, with plenty of\r\nfresh air and sunshine. It is the system of cultivation which I, in\r\ncommon with Mr. Howard and Mr. McIvor, consider to be the most likely\r\nto lead to successful results, because it is the only one by which\r\nremunerative harvests of bark can be obtained year by year, without\r\ninjuring the plants.\r\n\r\nTwo questions require consideration before adopting this method: first,\r\nwhether the chinchonæ in their shrubby form will yield a sufficient\r\nannual supply of febrifugal alkaloids to make the cultivation\r\nremunerative; and secondly, whether it will be possible to take the\r\nrequired quantity of bark every year, without checking the growth of\r\nthe trees.\r\n\r\nThe trunk or _tabla_ bark naturally yields a much larger per-centage of\r\nalkaloids than the _canuto_ or small bark of branches; but as a supply\r\nof the former could only be obtained once in forty years, and then at\r\nthe cost of destroying the plantations, while the latter will yield an\r\nannual harvest without any injury to the trees, this point is not of\r\nmuch consequence.[523]\r\n\r\nThe fact is that very little _tabla_ or trunk-bark comes from\r\nSouth America, and that nearly the entire bark trade is supplied\r\nby quill-bark from the branches of shrubs. Some Calisaya bark from\r\nBolivia, some \"red bark,\" and \"West-coast Carthagena,\" from the trunks\r\nof _C. Palton_, arrive in the form of large slabs of _tabla_-bark; but\r\na great deal of the Calisaya and succirubra bark, the whole of the\r\n\"crown-bark\" from Loxa, and all bark from other quarters, is found only\r\nin the form of quills from small branches. I have measured several\r\nof the quills which come into the London market, and find that none\r\nof them have bark equal in thickness to that already attained by some\r\nof the young plants reared by Mr. McIvor at Ootacamund.[524] These\r\nquills are evidently taken from small shrubs, and they yield a very\r\ngood per-centage of quinine. Several samples of quill Calisaya bark,\r\nsold in London in March 1862, contained four per cent. of quinine.\r\nTheir bark was one-eighth of an inch thick, and the quills were just\r\nunder an inch in circumference. In a cultivated state the yield will of\r\ncourse be much greater, and Mr. Howard, judging from the usual yield of\r\nquill-bark, is of opinion that a large produce may be annually realised\r\nby growing the chinchonæ as shrubs.[525]\r\n\r\nIn cultivating the chinchonæ in rows on cleared plantations it will\r\nprobably be found advisable to grow them to a height of ten or twelve\r\nfeet, and about twelve feet from each other, so that they may be\r\nable to spread out until they are nearly as broad as they are long;\r\nand they should be induced to branch as near the ground as possible.\r\nA certain number of the branches should be lopped annually for the\r\nquinine harvest; shoots would immediately be thrown out below the cuts,\r\nfrom which one or two should be selected to take the place of the\r\nlopped branch; and in about six years the new branches, thus formed,\r\nwould be sufficiently grown to be again removed. In the mean while\r\nthe same operation would have been going on with other branches, and\r\nthus an annual harvest of quill-bark may be obtained for any number of\r\nyears. Mr. McIvor considers that this treatment will ensure a quick,\r\nuniform, and constant supply of bark; and if the lopping and pruning is\r\njudiciously conducted, the trees will be benefited rather than injured\r\nby the annual removal of a few branches.[526] Chinchona-plants, like\r\noaks and willows, might also be cultivated as pollards.\r\n\r\nBy cultivating the chinchona-plants on these principles, forming\r\nplantations in cleared open ground, giving the plants plenty of\r\nlight and air, and obtaining annual harvests of quill-bark from\r\nthe shrubs, quinine-yielding chinchona-bark will become an article\r\nof commerce within eight years from the first introduction of the\r\nplants into India. After the first harvest the supply will rapidly\r\nincrease. Extensive Government plantations of the different species at\r\nNeddiwuttum and Dodabetta on the Neilgherries, will be in a position to\r\nsupply any number of chinchonæ for private enterprise, and it is to be\r\nhoped that the Government will establish other chinchona nurseries on\r\nthe Pulney hills, in Coorg, and eventually on the Anamallays.\r\n\r\nAs quinine-yielding bark is a more valuable product than coffee,\r\nthere is every reason to believe that, as soon as the Government\r\nplantations are proved to be successful, many planters will undertake\r\nthe cultivation; and I understand from Mr. McIvor that several persons\r\nhave already expressed a desire to give the chinchonæ a trial, and that\r\nhe expects to be able to distribute plants by June 1862.[527] Thus\r\nanother important product will be added to the resources of India,\r\nwhile the Government will have an abundant and cheap annual supply\r\nof the most indispensable of all medicines to Europeans in tropical\r\nclimates, which is now only obtained at immense expense, and in\r\nquantities quite insufficient to meet the demand.\r\n\r\nIn a commercial point of view the introduction of chinchona-plants\r\ninto India is likely to prove very beneficial, by adding another\r\nvaluable article of export to the numerous products of that favoured\r\nland; but an equal if not a greater result will be derived from this\r\nimportant measure, in the naturalisation of these healing plants in a\r\ncountry the inhabitants of which suffer so severely and constantly from\r\nintermittent and other fevers. From motives of humanity, as well as\r\nfrom personal interest, every coffee-planter, as I have before said,\r\nought to cultivate a few rows of chinchona-plants in the upper part of\r\nhis clearing. Even if it is not intended to rear them on account of\r\ntheir commercial value, yet such a measure recommends itself as a duty,\r\nin order to have a supply of this inestimable febrifuge constantly at\r\nhand for the use of those who are employed on the plantations.\r\n\r\nMany of the natives are already fully aware of the febrifugal virtues\r\nof Peruvian bark, and it is to be hoped that, in all the hill-districts\r\nwhere there is a suitable elevation and climate, they will grow\r\nchinchona-trees in their gardens, just as is now generally done with\r\ncoffee in all the villages in Coorg. For the use of the natives there\r\nwill be no necessity to go to the expense and trouble of extracting the\r\nalkaloids, as the green fresh bark is itself very efficacious. After\r\nthe natives have once used this unfailing remedy, and experienced the\r\npower it has over the fevers from which they suffer, they will, like\r\nDr. Poeppig in the wilds of Peru, approach the beautiful healing trees\r\nwith warm feelings of gratitude,[528] their fame will spread far and\r\nwide, and the cultivation of chinchonæ will, I trust, be extended to\r\nits utmost limit throughout the peninsula of India.\r\n\r\nSo far as my observations extended, the impression which I had\r\npreviously received, that the natives can with difficulty be induced\r\nto undertake the cultivation of any new plants to which they have not\r\nbeen accustomed, was not confirmed. Not to mention the potato, maize,\r\ntobacco, and capsicums, which originally came from America, and are now\r\ngenerally cultivated in India, it is a fact that in Wynaad upwards of\r\n2000 acres are taken up for coffee cultivation by the natives; and in\r\nCoorg, where coffee was only introduced about six years ago, I scarcely\r\nsaw a single hut to which a small coffee-garden was not attached.\r\nThe extent to which the cassava (_Jatophra Manihot_), only lately\r\nintroduced, is now cultivated in Travancore, is quite remarkable; and\r\nthere is every reason to suppose that the natives will be equally ready\r\nto cultivate a plant possessing such extraordinary febrifugal powers as\r\nthe chinchona, the value of which they will soon appreciate.\r\n\r\nThus will the successful cultivation of the quinine-yielding\r\nchinchona-plants confer a great and lasting benefit upon the people\r\nof India, as well as upon the commerce of the whole world; and the\r\nconcluding words of Dr. Weddell's Introduction[529] may, therefore,\r\nwith strict propriety, be applied to Mr. McIvor and his assistants:\r\n\"Reste la ressource de la culture, et il faut l'employer. S'il est\r\nun arbre digne d'être acclimaté, c'est certes le Quinquina; et la\r\npostérité bénirait ceux qui auraient mis à exécution une semblable\r\nidée.\"\r\n\r\nWhile speaking of the incalculable value of _quinine_-yielding\r\nchinchona-plants, it must be understood that I include those of the\r\n\"grey-bark\" species, which yield _chinchonine_; and it is the more\r\nimportant to dwell upon this, because a sentence in the Introduction to\r\nMr. Howard's valuable work is perhaps calculated to give a different\r\nimpression.[530] It is true that chinchonine will not command so\r\nremunerative a price in the London market; yet it produces effects\r\non the system precisely analogous to quinine. To stop intermittent\r\nfever, doses of chinchonine require to be one-third larger than doses\r\nof quinine; but it is absolutely certain that the former is as good\r\na febrifuge as the latter, and it costs infinitely less. Planters\r\nwill of course, in the first instance, undertake the cultivation\r\nof those species which yield quinine, such as _C. succirubra_, _C.\r\nCondaminea_, _C. lancifolia_, and _C. Calisaya_; but the grey-bark\r\nspecies will yield barks which will afford valuable supplies to the\r\nGovernment hospitals; and their naturalisation all over the plateau\r\nof the Neilgherries and other hill districts will be a great boon\r\nto the natives. Hereafter the latter species will well repay the\r\noutlay and labour of cultivation. Even now there is a great demand\r\nfor chinchonine; the chinchonidine of _C. Condaminea_ is considered\r\nby Mr. Howard to be scarcely if at all inferior to quinine, and Dr.\r\nJ. Macpherson thinks so highly of the value of chinchonine that he\r\nconsiders it to be of little importance whether the species introduced\r\ninto India are rich in quinine or chinchonine.

I have no doubt of the suitability\r\nof the Pulney hills, the Koondahs, the Anamallays, and Coorg for such\r\nexperimental cultivation; and trials should hereafter be made on the\r\nMahabaleshwurs, the high hills east of Goa, the Baba-bodeens, Nuggur,\r\nWynaad, the Shervaroys, and the mountains between Tinnevelly and\r\nTravancore.\r\n\r\nThe hill districts of the island of Ceylon, which have the\r\nnecessary elevation, and are within the region of both monsoons,\r\nalso offer peculiarly favourable conditions for the cultivation\r\nof chinchona-plants, probably equal to the best localities on the\r\npeninsula of India. Mr. Thwaites, the Director of the Royal Botanical\r\nGardens at Peradenia, takes a deep interest in this important\r\nmeasure, and under his auspices there can be no doubt of its ultimate\r\nsuccess. It was from the first determined to send a portion of\r\nthe chinchona-seeds to Ceylon, although the whole expense of the\r\nundertaking has been borne by the revenues of India, and no assistance\r\nwhatever has been given by those colonies which will thus profit by its\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nThe gardens at Peradenia are 1594 feet above the level of the sea, and\r\nthe following table will give a correct idea of the climate:--\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n              OBSERVATIONS taken at PERADENIA, in Ceylon, in 1857.\r\n  ----------+--------------------+----------+---------------------------\r\n            |     Thermometer.   | Rainfall |\r\n            +------+------+------+    in    |\r\n    MONTH.  | Max. |Mean. | Min. |  inches. |          REMARKS.\r\n  ----------+------+------+------+----------+---------------------------\r\n    1857.   |      |      |      |          |\r\n            |      |      |      |          |\r\n  January   | 82   | 79.3 | 74.7 |    1.8   |{ Fine and sunny.

The _C. succirubra_, and some other species, would\r\nprobably grow to fine large trees there, but the bark would be very\r\nthin, and would yield little or no febrifugal alkaloids. But there are\r\nmany other localities in Ceylon admirably suited, from their elevation\r\nand climate, for this cultivation, and sites may be selected, well\r\nadapted to the different species, from 5000 feet to Pedrotallagalle,\r\nwhich is 8280 feet above the sea. Among these is the Government garden\r\nof Hakgalle, at Nuwera-ellia, which is 6210 feet above the sea, in a\r\nclimate with an annual temperature of about 59° Fahr., and abundantly\r\nsupplied with moisture. Here most of the chinchona-plants have been\r\nestablished under the superintendence of Mr. Thwaites, who is assisted\r\nin their cultivation by Mr. McNicoll, a zealous and intelligent\r\ngardener from Kew. Mr. Thwaites reported, last September, that the\r\nprogress of the important experiment in the cultivation of chinchonæ\r\nwas satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIn February 1861 the first instalment of chinchona-seeds arrived\r\nin Ceylon, being a parcel of the \"grey-bark\" species sent from the\r\nNeilgherry hills by Mr. McIvor; and soon afterwards a portion of the\r\n\"red-bark\" seeds was received. In April six plants of _C. Calisaya_\r\nwere transmitted from Kew, but two only survived, and are now growing\r\nvigorously at Hakgalle. Last September eight cuttings had been taken\r\nfrom them, two of which had rooted. From the seeds received early in\r\n1861, 800 plants had been raised last September, namely, 530 of _C.\r\nsuccirubra_, 180 of _C. micrantha_, 25 of _C. Peruviana_, 45 of _C.\r\nnitida_, and 60 of the \"grey-bark\" species without name.\r\n\r\nIn January 1862 I forwarded parcels of seeds of _C. Condaminea_ and _C.\r\ncrispa_ to Mr. Thwaites; and early in March six Wardian cases filled\r\nwith chinchona-plants, from the depôt at Kew, were shipped for Ceylon.\r\n\r\nChinchona cultivation in Ceylon has thus been fairly started. It is\r\nexceedingly gratifying to hear that many coffee-planters will be glad\r\nto try the experiment upon their estates;[532] and that Mr. Thwaites\r\nwill shortly be in a position to distribute plants from the Hakgalle\r\ngarden.[533]\r\n\r\nChinchona-trees, in their wild state, have never been found at a\r\ngreater distance than one thousand miles from the equator, and they\r\nare essentially inter-tropical plants; though they only flourish\r\nat considerable elevations above the sea. The reason appears to be\r\nthat one of their chief requirements is a tolerably equable climate\r\nthroughout the year, which the temperate zones, with their great\r\ndifferences of temperature between winter and summer, do not afford.\r\nFor this reason sites were selected, in the first instance, both\r\nin India and Ceylon, within the tropics; and indeed this point was\r\nessential for the first experiments, because all the other conditions\r\nof the growth of chinchonæ could not have been found beyond the\r\nequatorial zone. Under cultivation, however, it is probable that,\r\nwith other favouring circumstances, these plants might thrive within\r\nthe temperate zone, at short distances from the tropic, and attention\r\nwas naturally drawn to the hill districts of the Eastern Himalayas,\r\nin Bengal. The usefulness and importance of the introduction of the\r\nchinchonæ into India will be much enhanced if their cultivation can be\r\nextended to these regions, and attempts will, therefore, be made to\r\nform chinchona plantations in Sikkim, Bhotan, and subsequently in the\r\nKhassya hills.\r\n\r\nThe province of Sikkim,[534] at the base of the mighty Himalayan peak\r\nof Kunchinginga, consists entirely of the basin of the river Tista,\r\nwhich, with its tributaries, drains the whole country. Its position,\r\nopposite to the opening of the Gangetic valley, between the mountains\r\nof Behar on the one hand and the Khassya hills on the other, exposes\r\nit to the full force of the monsoon. Its rains are, therefore, heavy\r\nand almost uninterrupted, accompanied by dense fogs and a saturated\r\natmosphere throughout the year. There are frequent winter rains\r\naccompanied by cold fogs, alternating with frost, hail, and snow.\r\nMarch and April are the driest months, but rains commence in May, and\r\ncontinue with little intermission until October. The bounding mountains\r\nare very lofty, and snow-clad throughout a great part of their extent;\r\nbut the central range in Sikkim, which separates the Tista from its\r\ngreat tributary the Rangit, is depressed till very far into the\r\ninterior. The rainy winds have thus free access to the heart of the\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nThe snow-level is at 16,000 feet; and the mean monthly temperature of\r\nthe English hill station at Darjeeling, which is 7430 feet above the\r\nsea, and in lat. 27° 3´ N., is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  -----------------------------\r\n           DARJEELING.\r\n  +------------+--------------+\r\n  |   MONTH.   |     Mean     |\r\n  |            | temperature. |\r\n  +------------+--------------+\r\n  | January    |     40       |\r\n  | February   |     42       |\r\n  | March      |     50.7     |\r\n  | April      |     55.9     |\r\n  | May        |     57.6     |\r\n  | June       |     61.2     |\r\n  | July       |     61.4     |\r\n  | August     |     61.7     |\r\n  | September  |     59.9     |\r\n  | October    |     58       |\r\n  | November   |     50       |\r\n  | December   |     42       |\r\n  +------------+--------------+\r\n\r\nThe annual rainfall is 122.2 inches.\r\n\r\nOf course no chinchona-plant would flourish in such a climate; and in\r\nthe latitude of 27° it will be necessary to seek for suitable sites in\r\nmuch lower situations than in the hill districts of Southern India,\r\nwhich are in corresponding latitudes to those of the chinchona forests.\r\nIn the Neilgherries the sites have been selected at the same altitudes\r\nas those at which the plants are found in South America, but in the\r\nEastern Himalayas the localities must probably be chosen upwards of\r\na thousand feet lower for each species--the _C. Condaminea_ and its\r\ncompanions perhaps at 5000, and the _C. succirubra_ between 3000 and\r\n4000 feet.\r\n\r\nFrom the sea-level to an elevation of 12,000 feet Sikkim is covered\r\nwith a dense forest, consisting of tall umbrageous trees, often with\r\ndense grass jungle, and in other places accompanied by a luxuriant\r\nundergrowth of shrubs. In the tropical zone _Myrtaceæ_, _Leguminosæ_,\r\nand tree-ferns are common, and the air is near saturation during a\r\ngreat part of the year. _Vaccinia_ are found at from 5000 to 8000,\r\nand snow occasionally falls at 6000 feet. A sub-tropical vegetation\r\npenetrates far into the interior along the banks of the great rivers,\r\nand tree-ferns, rattans, plantains, and other tropical plants are found\r\nat 5000 feet, in the Ratong valley.[535]\r\n\r\nI should conjecture that the extreme limit for the growth of the\r\nhardier species of chinchonæ, in Sikkim, will be found where their\r\nconstant companions the tree-ferns and _Vaccinia_ end, namely at 5000\r\nfeet; and that the best sites for such species as _C. Calisaya_ and _C.\r\nsuccirubra_ are about 1000 to 2000 feet lower, amidst the sub-tropical\r\nvegetation of the valleys.\r\n\r\nBhotan, which adjoins Sikkim on the east, is a mountainous district of\r\nmuch the same character. In its western part the mountain ranges are\r\nlofty and rugged, and the river-courses very deep and generally narrow.\r\nThe climate is equable, and the humidity of the winter appears to\r\nincrease in the part adjoining Sikkim. The steepness of the mountains,\r\nand the influence of the elevated mass of the Khassya hills to the\r\nsouth, make the lower slopes, which skirt the plains of Assam, drier\r\nthan those more to the eastward. Deep narrow valleys carry a tropical\r\nvegetation very far into the interior of Bhotan, among lofty mountains\r\ncapped with almost perpetual snow. These attract to themselves so much\r\nof the moisture of the atmosphere, that the bottoms of the valleys\r\nare comparatively dry and bare of forest. The flora resembles that of\r\nSikkim.[536]\r\n\r\nThe Khassya hills in 25° N. lat. form an isolated mass, rising up from\r\nthe plains of Assam and Silhet to a height of 6000 feet. They rise\r\nabruptly from the plains of Silhet to the south, and at 3000 feet tree\r\nvegetation ceases, and is succeeded by a bleak stony region, with a\r\ntemperate flora, up to 4000 feet, where the English station of Churra\r\nPoorji is built. The table-land is here three miles long by two, to\r\nthe eastward flat and stony, and to the west undulating and hilly.\r\nOn the south there are rocky ridges of limestone. The southern side\r\nof the hills is exposed to the full force of the monsoon, and the\r\nrainfall is excessive, as much as 500 or 600 inches annually. Further\r\nin the interior the fall is less, and it gradually decreases until\r\nthe valley of Assam is entered. This great rainfall is attributable\r\nto the abruptness of the mountains to the south, which face the Bay\r\nof Bengal, and are separated from it by 200 miles of Jheels and\r\nSunderbunds. The heavy rains on the Khassya hills are quite local, as\r\nin Silhet the fall is only 100 inches. The plateau presents a bleak\r\nand inhospitable aspect, and there is not a tree, and scarcely a shrub\r\nto be seen, except occasional clumps of _Pandanus_. This desolation is\r\ncaused by the furious gales of wind, and the extraordinary amount of\r\nrain which washes off the soil. The valleys are open, though with deep\r\nflanks, and the hill-tops are broad. The grassy slopes to the north\r\nare covered with clumps of shrubby vegetation, and the forests are\r\nconfined to sheltered localities. Though the rainfall on the southern\r\nside is 600 inches, twenty miles inland it is reduced to 200 inches.\r\nThe mean annual temperature of Churra Poorji is 66°, and in summer the\r\nthermometer rises to 88° and 90°. To the westward of the Khassyas lie\r\nthe Garrows, which do not attain a greater height than 3000 to 4000\r\nfeet.[537]\r\n\r\nThe flora of the Khassya hills bears a greater resemblance to\r\nthat of the hills in Southern India than to the Sikkim and Bhotan\r\ntypes. Genera and species forming masses of shrubby vegetation are\r\nidentical with those of the Neilgherry _sholas_. It is probable that\r\nchinchona-plantations, especially of _C. succirubra_, might hereafter\r\nbe formed advantageously on the northern slopes of the Khassyas, but\r\nit is evident that the best chances of success for the species growing\r\nat great altitudes, in South America, are offered in the Himalayan\r\ndistricts of Sikkim and Bhotan.\r\n\r\nWith a view to the establishment of chinchona-plantations in the\r\nEastern Himalayas, plants have been forwarded by Mr. McIvor to the\r\nBotanical Gardens at Calcutta. On January 19th, 1862, there were at\r\nCalcutta 91 plants of _C. succirubra_, all except four supplied by Mr.\r\nMcIvor; six of _C. Calisaya_ from Java, and 133 of \"grey-bark\" species,\r\nof which 106 were supplied by Mr. McIvor, and twenty-seven were raised\r\nfrom the original South American seeds. Altogether there were 230 of\r\nthe valuable species of Chinchonæ, besides fifty-nine of the worthless\r\n_C. Pahudiana_. It is intended to commence a chinchona plantation\r\non the lower and outer range of Darjeeling in Sikkim at once, with\r\na propagating-house on the model of Mr. McIvor's at Ootacamund; and\r\nafterwards to form a nursery for species growing at lower elevations on\r\nthe Khassya hills.\r\n\r\nThere is another region in our Eastern dominions where suitable\r\nlocalities may be found for the cultivation of chinchona-plants, but\r\nit is as yet too little explored, and the difficulties of obtaining\r\nsupplies, labour, and transport would be too great at present to allow\r\nof the possibility of forming plantations for some years to come.\r\nI allude to the recently formed province of Pegu. Dr. Brandis, the\r\nConservator of Forests in Pegu, reports that it will be preferable to\r\ndelay the introduction of chinchona-plants into that province, until\r\ntheir cultivation shall have proved successful in other parts.\r\n\r\nIn Pegu there are four great mountain ranges, running parallel with\r\nthe sea-coast, which separate the valleys of the principal rivers.\r\nCommencing from the eastward, the first range is the Arracan-Yomah,\r\ndividing Arracan from Pegu, which is not higher than 4000 feet. The\r\nPegu-Yomah, the principal seat of the Pegu teak, which separates the\r\nvalleys of the Irrawaddy and the Sitang, only has a mean elevation of\r\n2000 feet. The third range consists of the Martaban and Tenasserim\r\ncoast-ranges, and barely attains a height of 5000 feet. The fourth\r\nand most eastern range, forming the watershed between the Sitang and\r\nSalween rivers, extends into the large and compact mountain mass of\r\nYoonzaleen, to the south-east of Toungoo. The area of this lofty region\r\nis a hundred square miles, and several peaks rise to a height of 7000\r\nand 8000 feet above the sea. The rains are heavier on these hills than\r\non the adjacent plains, and the temperature is much cooler and more\r\nuniform. The formation consists of granite, gneiss, and quartzite.\r\nUp to 3000 feet the vegetation is of a tropical character, at which\r\nelevation teak disappears, and pines (_Pinus Khasyana_) begin, and\r\ngo up to 5000 feet on dry gravelly soil. There are plenty of small\r\nmountain streams on these hills, with running water throughout the\r\nyear; and the valleys and slopes are covered with evergreen forest.[538]\r\n\r\nThe Yoonzaleen hills are doubtless the best localities for\r\nchinchona-plantations in Pegu, but as yet there are no facilities for\r\ntaking any steps with a view to the introduction of these inestimable\r\ntrees, which will hereafter be as great a blessing to the fever-haunted\r\njungles of Pegu as to those of India. The Yoonzaleens are forty\r\nmiles from the town of Toungoo, which is at a distance of fifteen\r\ndays of river navigation from Rangoon; and until a Sanatarium is\r\nformed on those hills, or some European settlers have established\r\nthemselves there, it will be useless to attempt the introduction of the\r\nchinchona-plants. Before many years, however, it is to be hoped that\r\nplantations on the Yoonzaleen hills will supply quinine-yielding bark\r\nto the inhabitants of the plains of Pegu.\r\n\r\nIn a former chapter I stated that I gave directions for the\r\ntransmission of a supply of seeds both of the \"grey\" and the \"red-bark\"\r\nspecies to two of our West Indian islands--Trinidad and Jamaica. In\r\nTrinidad they did not germinate, but in Jamaica, under the watchful\r\ncare of Mr. N. Wilson, the Superintendent of the Botanical Gardens\r\nin that colony, they came up plentifully. By the spring of 1861 Mr.\r\nWilson had a good stock of all the species in the gardens on the\r\nsweltering plains, where the \"grey-bark\" species naturally began to\r\ndie off, but the _C. succirubra_ plants were doing well, and sixty of\r\nthem were quite strong enough to be planted out early in June. On the\r\n4th of June, 1861, Mr. Wilson removed 120 plants, 60 of _C. micrantha_\r\nand 60 of _C. nitida_, to the foot of Catherine's Peak, which is\r\n4000 feet above the sea. Here he was obliged to leave them, as the\r\nJamaica Government had furnished him with no efficient assistant. In\r\nNovember he reported that the plants of _C. succirubra_ were doing\r\nwell, and by the latest accounts, dated March 24th, 1862, all the\r\nplants were thriving; but the chinchona experiment is not likely to\r\nsucceed in Jamaica, owing to the listless apathy of the legislators\r\nof this colony. They have taken no steps to supply Mr. Wilson with\r\nassistant-gardeners, have allotted no land in suitable localities as\r\nsites for chinchona-plantations, and have thus neglected to secure the\r\nsuccessful introduction of a product which would have enriched the\r\nisland, when the means of doing so were placed gratuitously at their\r\ndisposal by the Secretary of State for India.\r\n\r\nIn our Eastern possessions the successful cultivation of\r\nquinine-yielding plants in the hills of Southern India, in Ceylon, and\r\nin the Eastern Himalayas, will undoubtedly be productive of the most\r\nbeneficial results. Commercially this measure will add a very important\r\narticle to the list of Indian exports; the European community will\r\nbe provided with a cheap and constant supply of an article which, in\r\ntropical climates, is to them a necessary of life; and the natives of\r\nfever-haunted districts may everywhere have the inestimable healing\r\nbark growing at their doors.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to exaggerate the blessings which the introduction of\r\nchinchona-cultivation will confer upon India. Since quinine has been\r\nextensively used among the troops in India, there has been a steady\r\ndiminution of mortality; and whereas in 1830 the average per-centage\r\nof deaths to cases of fever treated was 3.66, in 1856 it was only one\r\nper cent. in a body of 18,000 men scattered from Peshawur to Pegu.[539]\r\nThe present measure will not only ensure a constant and cheap supply\r\nof quinine to those who already enjoy its benefits, but it will also\r\nbring its use within the means of millions who have hitherto been\r\nunable to procure it. Many lives will thus annually be saved by its\r\nagency. In former ages its use would perhaps have changed the history\r\nof the world. Alexander the Great died of the common remittent fever\r\nof Babylon, merely from the want of a few doses of quinine.[540]\r\nOliver Cromwell was carried off by ague, and, had Peruvian bark been\r\nadministered to him, which was even then known in London, the greatest\r\nand most patriotic of England's rulers would have been preserved to\r\nhis country. In time to come the lives of men of equal importance to\r\ntheir generation may be saved by its use, while the blessings which\r\nit will confer on the great mass of mankind, and especially on the\r\ninhabitants of tropical countries, are incalculable. The introduction\r\nof chinchona-plants into our Eastern possessions will be the most\r\neffective measure which could have been adopted to ensure a permanent\r\nand abundant supply of febrifugal bark; and a debt of gratitude is,\r\ntherefore, due from India to Lord Stanley, who originated it, and to\r\nSir Charles Wood, who has sanctioned all the necessary arrangements,\r\nuntil this great enterprise has finally been crowned with complete\r\nsuccess. To Mr. Spruce, as the most successful collector in South\r\nAmerica, and to Mr. McIvor, who has so ably and zealously conducted the\r\ncultivation in India, the chief credit of having achieved so important\r\na result is due; but the author may be allowed to express his deep\r\nsatisfaction at having been one of the labourers in this good work,\r\nwhere all have worked so zealously.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CANOE ON THE BEYPOOR RIVER. See page 351.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A.\r\n\r\n\r\n  GENERAL MILLER, AND THE FOREIGN OFFICERS WHO SERVED IN THE PATRIOT\r\n  ARMIES OF CHILE AND PERU, BETWEEN 1817 AND 1830.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN the war of independence broke out in South America, many gallant\r\nspirits were attracted from different countries of Europe to fight for\r\nliberty and justice against Spanish oppression. Fired with enthusiasm\r\nfor the cause of liberty, these knights errant, many of whom had been\r\ndistinguished in the wars of Napoleon and Wellington, went forth to\r\nrisk their lives for an idea. That they were in earnest is proved by\r\nthe fact that, out of the whole number of sixty-seven, as many as\r\ntwenty-five were killed or drowned, and eighteen were wounded.\r\n\r\nIn this band of brave adventurers, next perhaps to Lord Dundonald,\r\nthe late General Miller takes the most prominent place, as one of the\r\nablest, the truest, and the best. There is a halo of romance round all\r\nwho joined in this crusade for liberty; all passed through many strange\r\nadventures, and did honour to the land from which they hailed; but the\r\nlamented old warrior who went to his rest last year was pre-eminent\r\namongst his gallant companions, for his many acts of chivalrous daring\r\nand bravery.\r\n\r\nWilliam Miller, a native of Kent, served in the British Field Train\r\nDepartment of the Royal Artillery, during the Peninsular war, under\r\nLord Wellington. He was present at the sieges and storming of Ciudad\r\nRodrigo, Badajoz, and San Sebastian, at the battle of Vittoria, and\r\ninvestment of Bayonne. He had charge of a company of Sappers and Miners\r\nin the American war, was within a few yards of General Ross when he\r\nreceived his death-wound near Baltimore, and was also present at the\r\nattack upon New Orleans in 1814.\r\n\r\nIn 1817, having been placed on half-pay, and tired of an inactive\r\nlife, he proceeded to South America, and offered his services in the\r\nwar against the Spaniards. He was appointed Captain of artillery by\r\nthe Government of the United Provinces of Rio de la Plata, crossed the\r\nAndes into Chile, and saved two pieces of artillery, under a heavy\r\nfire, at the battle of Talca, in March 1818. In April he became a\r\nMajor, and assisted with his regiment at the declaration of Chilian\r\nindependence on September 18th, 1818. In 1819 he commanded the Marines\r\nin Lord Cochrane's squadron, and in March an explosion of gunpowder, on\r\nthe island of San Lorenzo, in Callao Bay, shattered one of his hands\r\nto pieces, injured his face, and caused blindness for many days. In\r\nOctober he was again at the head of his men, leading them to victory\r\nat Pisco, when he was pierced by two balls, one passing through his\r\nliver, and another through his breast. In February 1820, though still\r\nweak and suffering from his former desperate wounds, he headed the\r\nstorming party in the boats, in the gallant attack and capture of the\r\nforts of Valdivia in Chile, where he was again wounded in the head;\r\nand in the subsequent attempt on Chiloe he received a ball through his\r\nleft groin, and a cannon-shot broke one of his feet. In May 1821 he\r\nlanded in Peru, and defeated the Spaniards in the hard-fought battle of\r\nMirabe; in 1823 he conducted a most adventurous and romantic campaign\r\nthrough the whole range of the deserts of Peru, from Arequipa to Pisco,\r\ndefeating the Spaniards, with greatly inferior numbers, on several\r\noccasions; and in the same year he became General of Brigade.\r\n\r\nIn May 1824 General Miller received the command of the Peruvian cavalry\r\nof Bolivar's liberating army, and took a principal part in the victory\r\nof Junin in the following August. Soon afterwards he assumed the\r\ncommand of the whole of the cavalry of the liberating army, at the head\r\nof which he charged, and routed the division of General Valdez in the\r\nglorious battle of Ayacucho, at a most critical moment. This brilliant\r\naction was fought on the 9th of December 1824, and decided the fate of\r\nthe war, the entire Spanish army of 10,000 men under General La Serna,\r\nViceroy of Peru, being utterly routed. In February 1825 he was Prefect\r\nof Puno, and in April of Potosi; but in 1826 he returned to England on\r\nleave of absence, to cure himself of his wounds, which still caused him\r\ngreat suffering.\r\n\r\nAfter a stay of some years in England he returned to Peru in June\r\n1830 but, owing to the factious outbreaks in which he did not choose\r\nto take part, he again obtained leave of absence in 1831, and visited\r\nmany of the islands of the Pacific Ocean, especially the Sandwich and\r\nSociety groups, of which he wrote a most interesting account; and only\r\nreturned to Peru after the constitutional election of General Orbegoso\r\nas President of the Republic. In the early part of 1834 he served in a\r\ncampaign against the revolutionary chief Gamarra; and, though defeated\r\nat Huaylacucho, his operations were on the whole successful, and he was\r\npromoted to the rank of Grand Marshal of Peru on June 11th, 1834.\r\n\r\nIn October 1834 he was appointed Military Governor of Arequipa, Puno,\r\nand Cuzco; and it was at this time that he conceived the idea of\r\nforming a military colony in the valleys to the eastward of Cuzco, on\r\nthe banks of some of the tributaries of the great river Purus. In March\r\n1835, while on the point of setting out on an exploring expedition,\r\na revolution broke out in Cuzco, and he was arrested by Colonel\r\nLopera. He was, however, allowed to set out on his expedition, with\r\ntwo companions and seven Indians. He penetrated on foot to a greater\r\ndistance to the eastward of Cuzco, on this occasion, than has ever been\r\ndone before or since.\r\n\r\nIn September 1835 he again placed himself under the orders of the\r\nConstitutional President Orbegoso, and in February 1836 he captured\r\nSalaverry and eighty officers of his revolutionary army by a very\r\nclever stratagem, near Islay. Shortly afterwards Santa Cruz\r\nestablished the Peru-Bolivian Confederation, and General Miller was\r\nsent as Minister Plenipotentiary to Ecuador, where he signed a treaty\r\nof peace and amity between that Republic and the Confederation. In\r\nAugust 1837 he became Governor of Callao, when all customs duties\r\nwere reduced one half, smuggling ceased, and the receipts were soon\r\nquadrupled. He organized an efficient police; made a subterraneous\r\naqueduct 3 feet wide, 3-1/2 deep, and 280 yards long, for supplying\r\nCallao with water; commenced the erection of a college; and formed a\r\ntramway for the conveyance of goods from the mole to the custom-house.\r\nThe people of Callao still look back with satisfaction and gratitude to\r\nthe period when General Miller was their Governor.\r\n\r\nIn February 1839, on the overthrow of the Peru-Bolivian Confederation,\r\nGeneral Miller was banished with many other able and distinguished\r\nmen, whose names were taken off the army list by a decree dated in the\r\nfollowing March. This unjust and illegal act was cancelled by a law of\r\nCongress dated October 1847.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Peru in 1839, General Miller was appointed in 1843 H.\r\nM. Commissioner and Consul-General for the Islands in the Pacific. In\r\n1859 he revisited Chile and Peru, partly for his health, and partly to\r\nobtain the payment of his large arrears from the Government. When he\r\narrived in Peru the Vice-President Mar, while the President, General\r\nCastilla, was absent at Guayaquil in 1859, reinstated him on the army\r\nlist of Peru, by a decree dated December 9th, the anniversary of\r\nthe battle of Ayacucho, and granted him his current pay as a Grand\r\nMarshal of Peru, and he continued to reside at Lima until his death\r\non the 31st of October 1861. It is satisfactory to be able to record,\r\nfor the honour of the Peruvian nation, that the whole of his claims\r\nwere acknowledged in Congress in a most handsome way, and without a\r\ndissentient voice. But unfortunately the executive in Peru is still\r\nable to set the laws passed by the representatives of the people at\r\ndefiance; delays and evasions were resorted to by Castilla, and the\r\nlast days of one from whom Peru had perhaps received as valuable\r\nservices as from any of her own sons, were embittered by the treatment\r\nwhich he experienced from the President of the Republic.\r\n\r\nGeneral Miller was a man of whom England may well be proud. He was\r\none of those characters who combine great ability and extraordinary\r\ndaring, almost amounting to rashness, with modesty and diffidence. If\r\nthere was any fault to be found in any part of General Miller's former\r\ncareer, in the camp or in the cabinet, it would be from himself that\r\nit would first be heard. To his bravery and prowess, his body riddled\r\nwith bullets, and the history of South American independence, bear\r\ntestimony; to his administrative ability the gratitude of the people\r\nof Callao and Cuzco is the witness; his pure standard of honour, his\r\nscrupulous integrity, his warmth of heart, and single-mindedness are\r\nknown to a wide circle of sorrowing friends; but of his numerous acts\r\nof self-denial and charity few can tell, for he was one who let not his\r\nleft hand know what his right hand did.\r\n\r\nIn person he was more than six feet high, and when young he was\r\nremarkably handsome; his features and shape of the head being of a\r\nthoroughly English type. In society he was exceedingly agreeable to\r\nthe last; his conversation was always interesting, and often very\r\ninstructive; and there was a peculiarly gentle and winning expression\r\nin his eyes. He took a deep interest in the attempt to introduce\r\nchinchona cultivation into India, and I was indebted to him for much\r\nvaluable advice, and for many letters of introduction which were of\r\ngreat service to me. He also supplied me with most of the material\r\nwhich has enabled me to write the narrative of the insurrection of\r\nTupac Amaru, the last of the Incas, forming the ninth chapter of the\r\npresent work.\r\n\r\nHis memoirs, published by his brother many years ago, give by far the\r\nfullest and most interesting account of the war of independence in\r\nChile and Peru, though the work of Garcia Camba, a Spanish general, is\r\nthe best military history.\r\n\r\nGeneral Miller breathed his last on board H.M.S. 'Naiad' in Callao Bay,\r\non the 31st of October 1861; and the remains of the gallant old warrior\r\nwere interred in the cemetery at Bella Vista, with all the honours\r\nwhich the Peruvian Government could bestow. While the body was being\r\nembalmed, two bullets were found in it, and twenty-two wounds were\r\ncounted on different parts of his frame. The most gratifying incident\r\non the occasion was that the people of Callao, who had never forgotten\r\nthe good he had done them as their Governor, insisted on carrying the\r\ncoffin.\r\n\r\nOne of the last things on which General Miller was employed was the\r\ncompilation of the list of his brave companions in arms. Such a list,\r\nI believe, has never appeared before; and as the employment interested\r\nand amused him during a time of much harassing annoyance, it gives me\r\ngreat pleasure to be able to insert it here, in order that his labour\r\nmay not have been entirely in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A LIST of Foreign Officers, Europeans (not Spaniards) and North\r\n  Americans, who served in the patriot armies in Chile and Peru, between\r\n  the years 1817 and 1830, showing the killed, wounded, and not wounded.\r\n\r\n  [The rank specified is that which each officer held when killed, or in\r\n  1830.]\r\n\r\n\r\nKILLED.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GEN.

BY ALEXANDER SMITH, ESQ.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE following enumeration of Indian febrifuge plants, though, from\r\nthe limited time at my disposal, not so complete as could be wished,\r\nwill serve to give an idea of the great variety of indigenous plants\r\nused by the natives of India in the treatment of the different kinds\r\nof fevers so prevalent in that country. European physicians of the\r\npresent day rely to a great extent upon the invaluable products of the\r\n_Chinchonas_, as the most certain remedies for these disorders; but a\r\ncouple of centuries ago, when _quinine_ and the kindred alkaloids were\r\nundreamt of, and when even Peruvian Bark, or, as it was then called,\r\n\"Countess' Bark\" or \"Jesuits' Bark,\" was scarcely known, and its source\r\na jealously guarded secret, their ancestors made use of a much greater\r\nnumber of substances, and highly extolled the febrifuge properties\r\nof many of our native wild plants. Most of these, however, are now\r\nknown to be of little use and are discarded from the modern practice\r\nof physic, though amongst rustic practitioners, or herb-doctors, they\r\nstill to a certain degree enjoy their ancient reputation. We must not\r\ntherefore be surprised that the native doctors of the East, whose\r\nknowledge of chemistry and the allied sciences is as limited as was\r\nthat of our old herbalists, should in like manner ascribe powerful\r\nproperties to the barks, roots, stems, and other parts of plants which\r\nin reality possess as little value in a medical point of view, as the\r\nindigenous plants at one time used in our own country.\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be imagined from these remarks that all the\r\nplants mentioned below are known to be completely devoid of medicinal\r\nproperties. Some of them possibly possess qualities of the greatest\r\nvalue, and, were they properly tested by the enlightened science of\r\nthe present day, might yield products useful either as tonics or\r\nfebrifuges, or prove otherwise valuable. But the great majority are\r\ncomparatively valueless, and their supposed virtues merely the result\r\nof fancy.\r\n\r\n  ALEX. SMITH.\r\n\r\n_Kew, Surrey, April 5th, 1862._\r\n\r\n\r\nRANUNCULACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHALICTRUM FOLIOLOSUM, _D. C._\r\n\r\nThe bitter roots of this Himalayan species of Meadow Rue are used\r\nby the natives in intermittent fevers, and have, according to\r\nO'Shaughnessy, been experimented upon by European practitioners,\r\nand found serviceable not only as a febrifuge, but as a tonic in\r\nconvalescence from acute diseases. The plant is an erect, branching\r\nperennial, three or more feet high, with large quadripinnate leaves\r\ncomposed of numerous small leaflets. It is common throughout the\r\nHimalayas, and is called \"Pelijuree\" or \"Shuprak\" by the natives.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPTIS TEETA, _Wall._\r\n\r\nSeveral bitter roots are called \"Teeta\" in the Bengal bazaars. Those of\r\nthe present plant are brought down from the Mishmee Mountains on the\r\nnorthern borders of Assam, and are consequently called \"Mishmee Teeta.\"\r\nThey are usually packed in little baskets about two inches wide,\r\nmade of strips of rattan-cane. In the Scinde bazaars they are called\r\n\"Mahmira,\" and they are likewise said to be imported from China under\r\nthe name of \"Sou-line\" or \"Chyn-len,\" but the plant is not known to\r\nbe a native of that country. They have an intensely bitter taste, and\r\nthe native doctors esteem them very highly as a tonic and stomachic.\r\nM. Virey says that a decoction of them is a powerful febrifuge, but\r\nO'Shaughnessy states that in experiments made in the Indian hospitals\r\nthey did not seem to exercise any febrifuge virtues, though their tonic\r\nproperties were very manifest. The roots of an allied American species\r\n(_Coptis trifolia_, Salisb.) are used throughout the United States and\r\nCanada as a tonic, under the name of \"Gold Thread.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nACONITUM, _sp. pl._\r\n\r\nThe roots of several species of Aconite, common in the Himalayas, are\r\nreputed to possess febrifuge properties, but the identification of the\r\nparticular species is very uncertain. Amongst others the most virulent\r\nkind of \"Bikh\" or \"Bish,\" that yielded by the _Aconitum ferox_,\r\nWall., is said to be thus employed and also in chronic rheumatism;\r\nand likewise the \"Bikhma\" of Hamilton, supposed to be the _Aconitum\r\npalmatum_, Don. The little tuber-like roots called \"Atees\" or \"Butees,\"\r\nmuch esteemed for their bitter tonic properties, are afforded by the\r\n_Aconitum heterophyllum_, Wall.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNOLIACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nMICHELIA CHAMPACA, _Linn._\r\n\r\nSeveral of the _Magnoliaceæ_ are known to possess powerful febrifuge\r\nvirtues, particularly the _Magnolia glauca_, Linn., and other\r\nAmerican species, the bark and fruits of which are greatly used in\r\nintermittent fever. Among the Indian species, the only one reputed\r\nto possess similar virtues is the \"Champa\" (_Michelia Champaca_,\r\nLinn.), O'Shaughnessy remarking that, after several trials, its bark\r\nappeared to him to possess the properties attributed to the _Magnolia\r\nglauca_. It, however, contains tannin and gallic acid, both of which\r\nare absent in the American bark. The Champa grows to a large size,\r\nhas ovate-lanceolate leaves from eight to ten inches long and two to\r\nfour broad, and bears exceedingly fragrant yellow or orange-coloured\r\nflowers, which the Hindus offer to their deities.\r\n\r\n\r\nBERBERIDACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nBERBERIS LYCIUM, _Royle_.\r\n\r\nAccording to the learned investigations of the late Dr. Royle, it would\r\nappear that this species of Barberry afforded the λύκιον ινδικον of\r\nDioscorides. At the present day an extract of the sliced root, stem,\r\nand branches is prepared in Nipal and the Dhoon, and employed by the\r\nnative doctors in diseases of the eyes, for which purpose the drug was\r\nalso valued by the physicians of old. It is known in Bengal by the name\r\nof \"Rusoot\" or \"Rasot,\" and in Scinde by that of \"Ruswul.\" Employed as\r\na substitute for Chinchona bark this extract has been found to be a\r\nmost valuable remedial agent in common and tertian agues, checking the\r\nfever in three days. The skin is invariably moist during its action.\r\nThe plant is a small stiff shrub with twiggy, pale-barked branches\r\narmed with conical tripartite spines, and bearing clusters of small\r\nobovate-lanceolate leaves, either entire or with spiny teeth along the\r\nedges.\r\n\r\n\r\nMENISPERMACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nTINOSPORA CORDIFOLIA, _Miers_ (= _Cocculus cordifolius_, D. C., and\r\n_Menispermum cordifolium_, Willd.).\r\n\r\nA tall, climbing shrub with rough corky bark, and broad, heart-shaped,\r\npointed leaves from two to four inches long, upon stalks of about the\r\nsame length; common in woods throughout the peninsula of India and in\r\nCeylon, and known in the former country by the name of \"Guluncha\" or\r\n\"Gurcha,\" and amongst the Cinghalese by that of \"Rassakinda.\" All parts\r\nof the plant have a bitter taste, and an infusion of the young stems\r\nand leaves is highly esteemed by the native physicians as a febrifuge\r\nmedicine, and also as a tonic, while in some districts it is looked\r\nupon as a certain cure for poisonous snake-bites. Ainslie says that the\r\nbruised plant is put into the water drunk by the Brahmins at some of\r\ntheir religious ceremonies.\r\n\r\n\r\nTINOSPORA CRISPA, _Miers_ (= _Cocculus crispus_, D. C., and\r\n_Menispermum crispum_, Linn.).\r\n\r\nThis is closely allied to the above, and is known by the same name,\r\n\"Guluncha.\" It has smooth bark, more oval and less heart-shaped leaves\r\non shorter stalks. Like the last it is greatly valued in the treatment\r\nof intermittent fever; but the natives in Silhet consider that it is\r\nmore efficacious when found climbing upon mango-trees. It is found in\r\nSilhet and Pegu, and in several of the Indian islands.\r\n\r\n\r\nCISSAMPELOS PAREIRA, _Linn._\r\n\r\nThe woody stems of this widely spread tropical plant are used in\r\na variety of diseases, and amongst others in fevers, but it is\r\nprincipally valued for its antilithic properties, on account of which\r\nit is admitted into our Pharmacopœias under the name of Pareira-brava.\r\nIt is a tall, hard-wooded climber, indigenous to the tropics of both\r\nhemispheres, and is found in all parts of India. In Ceylon, where it is\r\nalso used as a fever medicine, it is called \"Deyamitta.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPPARIDACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nGYNANDROPSIS PENTAPHYLLA, _D. C._ (= _Cleome pentaphylla_, Linn.).\r\n\r\nA decoction of the little black seeds of this plant is considered\r\nuseful in typhus fever, and in convulsive affections. The plant is\r\ncalled \"Vaylee\" in the Tamul language; \"Hurhuriya\" in Bengalese;\r\n\"Caraila\" by the Hindus; and \"Waila\" by the Cinghalese. It is an annual\r\nplant, a foot or more in height, with hairy stems, and palmately\r\ndivided leaves usually with five, but sometimes with seven or only\r\nthree segments.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRATÆVA NURVALA, _Ham._ (= _Cratæva Tapia_, Burm.).\r\n\r\nA small tree, fifteen to twenty feet high, common on the banks of\r\nrivers on the Malabar coast and in Mysore, producing an astringent\r\nbark, a decoction of which is prescribed as a tonic in both\r\nintermittent and typhus fevers. The Sanscrit name of the plant is\r\n\"Varuna,\" and it is the \"Nurvala\" of Rheede's Hortus Malabaricus,\r\naccording to Hamilton, who says that the real name of the plant in the\r\nMalabar dialect is \"Vala,\" the prefix \"Nur\" (water) merely denoting the\r\nlocalities in which the tree is found.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORINGACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORINGA PTERYGOSPERMA, _Gaertn._ (= _Hyperanthera Moringa_, Vahl.).\r\n\r\nWell known in India as the Horse-radish tree, on account of its roots\r\npossessing a pungent odour and biting aromatic taste similar to\r\nthose of our common horse-radish, for which they are substituted by\r\nEuropean residents in both the East and West Indies. They are also\r\nused medicinally by the native doctors as a stimulant in paralysis and\r\nintermittent fevers, and are also considered valuable as a rubefacient.\r\n\"Morunghy,\" from which the generic name adopted by modern botanists has\r\nbeen derived, is the Tamul name; and \"Sujna\" or \"Salijuna,\" the Hindu.\r\nIt is a small tree, seldom more than twenty feet high, and has large\r\ncompound three-times pinnated leaves, and axillary bunches of whitish\r\nflowers, producing long pendulous three-sided fruits, containing\r\nnumerous winged seeds, which some authors regard as the source of the\r\ncelebrated Ben-oil.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARYOPHYLLACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOLLUGO CERVIANA, _Ser._ (= _Pharnaceum Cervianum_, Linn.).\r\n\r\nThis little herb is used as a medicine in fevers in Ceylon, where it\r\nis called \"Pat-paadagan;\" and as the plant is also found in the Indian\r\npeninsula, it is most probably employed in a similar manner by the\r\nHindu doctors. The order to which it belongs is remarkable for little\r\nbesides the presence of _saponine_ in several species.\r\n\r\n\r\nMALVACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIDA ACUTA, _Burm._ (= _Sida lanceolata_, Retz.).\r\n\r\nThe roots of this have an intensely bitter taste, and their infusion,\r\nin conjunction with ginger, is prescribed in cases of intermittent\r\nfever, for which they have also been tried in the Indian hospitals, but\r\nwithout satisfactory results, though they were found to possess some\r\nmedicinal virtues as a tonic. The plant is called \"Pata\" in Sanscrit;\r\nand \"Malaytanghie\" in Tamul. It is a shrub with narrow lance-shaped,\r\npointed leaves, coarsely toothed along the edges, and either smooth or\r\nsprinkled with bristly hairs, especially on the veins underneath.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAVONIA ZEYLANICA, _Cav._ (= _Hibiscus Zeylanicus_, Linn.).\r\n\r\nA tall annual plant, with variable leaves, the lower ones being\r\nroundish heart-shaped, and the upper deeply three to five lobed, and\r\nwhitish or pale-red flowers. It is called \"Sittamootie\" in Tamul, and\r\nan infusion of the root is administered in fevers, but Ainslie states\r\nthat it does not appear to possess any virtues.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLACACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLAX ZEYLANICA, _Linn._\r\n\r\nA small tree, native of Ceylon and of some parts of India, yielding\r\na fœtid, salt-tasted wood, which is employed in putrid fevers. The\r\nCinghalese, who call the tree \"Malla,\" eat the leaves in their curries.\r\n\r\n\r\nAURANTIACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nÆGLE MARMELOS, _Corr._ (= _Cratæva Marmelos_, Linn.).\r\n\r\nThe Bengal Quince-tree. Almost every part of this tree is used\r\nmedicinally by the native Indian doctors. In fever cases a decoction of\r\nthe bark of the root, and also of the stem, is employed, but when the\r\nlatter is used it is generally combined with a great variety of other\r\nsubstances. The expressed juice of the leaves, diluted with water,\r\nis also administered in incipient fevers and colds. The fruit is a\r\nvaluable remedy in diarrhœa and dysentery, and has been successfully\r\nemployed in those complaints by medical men in this country. It is a\r\ntree of moderate size, with its young branches furnished with sharp\r\nspines, and has ternate or rarely pinnate leaves, and axillary panicles\r\nof few large fragrant flowers. It has a great number of vernacular\r\nnames. In Hindustanee and Bengalee it is called \"Bael, Bêl, or Bêla;\"\r\nin Telinga, \"Maredoo;\" in Tamul, \"Willamarvum;\" in Malayan, \"Tanghula,\"\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELIACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nAZADIRACHTA INDICA, _A. de Juss._ (= _Melia Azadirachta_, Linn.).\r\n\r\nThe bitter astringent bark of this tree, the Neem or Margosa tree of\r\nIndia, is considered by the native doctors to be a most valuable tonic\r\nand febrifuge, and it has been successfully employed as a substitute\r\nfor Chinchona-bark by English physicians in India. A bitter principle\r\ncalled _Azadirine_ has been obtained from it. Other parts of the tree\r\nare likewise reputed to possess medicinal properties: the bitter oil\r\nobtained from the pericarp being employed as an anthelmintic, and the\r\nolive-like fruit itself in leprosy, while the leaves are universally\r\nused in India for poultices. The Neem forms a large ornamental tree,\r\nand has pinnate leaves with unequal-sided smooth leaflets sharply\r\ntoothed at the edges, and loose axillary panicles of bluish flowers.\r\n\"Neem\" or \"Nim\" is its Hindustanee and Bengalee name; \"Nimba,\" in\r\nSanscrit; \"Vaypun\" or \"Vapan,\" in Tamul; and \"Kohomba,\" in Cinghalese.\r\n\r\n\r\nCEDRELACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nCEDRELA TOONA, _Roxb._\r\n\r\nThe Toon-tree grows to a large size, and yields a valuable reddish\r\ntimber, resembling some kinds of mahogany. It has abruptly pinnate\r\nleaves composed of from six to twelve pairs of opposite, usually\r\nentire, smooth leaflets of an ovate-lanceolate shape; and its flowers\r\nare small, yellowish, and sweet-scented, and are disposed in terminal\r\ndrooping panicles. Toon bark is powerfully astringent, but is said\r\nto be devoid of bitterness. It is much esteemed in the treatment of\r\nintermittent fever, though seldom administered alone, but generally\r\nprescribed in combination with the excessively bitter seed of the\r\n_Guilandina Bonducella_. The flowers yield a yellow dye, but the colour\r\nis not permanent.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOYMIDA FEBRIFUGA, _A. de Juss._ (= _Swietenia febrifuga_, Roxb.).\r\n\r\nThe specific name of this tree indicates its use as a medicine in\r\nfevers. The part employed is the bark, which is of a reddish colour and\r\nhas a very bitter, slightly astringent, but not unpleasant taste. It\r\nwas long ago highly recommended as a substitute for Peruvian bark by\r\nseveral English doctors in India, and appears to possess considerable\r\nmedicinal virtues, though Ainslie found that when given in large doses\r\nit deranged the nervous system, occasioned vertigo and subsequent\r\nstupor. The tree is called \"Shemmarum\" by the Tamuls; \"Soimido\" by the\r\nTelingas (whence the generic name adopted by botanists); and \"Rohuna\"\r\nby the Bengalese. It is a very large, hard-wooded tree, with abruptly\r\npinnate leaves composed of from three to six pairs of opposite,\r\noval-oblong blunt leaflets; and produces large panicles of small\r\nyellowish flowers towards the points of the young branches.\r\n\r\nThe bark of another large Indian tree belonging to this order, the\r\n\"Chikrassee\" of the Bengalese (_Chickrassia tabularis_, A. de Juss.),\r\nis a powerful astringent, but, like the Toon bark, devoid of bitterness.\r\n\r\n\r\nOXALIDACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nAVERRHOA BILIMBI, _Linn._\r\n\r\nA syrup prepared with the juice of the excessively acid gherkin-like\r\nfruits of the Bilimbi is used by the native doctors in the treatment\r\nof fevers, as also is a conserve of the flowers. The Bilimbi is a\r\nsmall tree, with unequally pinnate leaves, which, like those of the\r\nwell-known sensitive plant, are irritable and close their leaflets\r\ntogether when touched. Its fruits are commonly used for pickling by\r\nEuropeans, both in the East and in the West Indies.\r\n\r\n\r\nXANTHOXYLACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nTODDALIA ACULEATA, _Pers._ (= _Scopolia aculeata_, Smith).\r\n\r\nPowerful stimulating properties are ascribed to all parts of this\r\nplant. The fresh bark of its root is administered by the Telinga\r\nphysicians, who call the plant \"Conda cashinda,\" for the cure of the\r\nkind of remittent fever known by the name of \"hill fever,\" from its\r\nbeing caught in the jungles of the Indian hills. It is a moderately\r\ntall shrub with prickly stems and branches, alternate, trifoliate,\r\nsmooth leaves marked with numberless pellucid dots, and usually having\r\nprickles on their stalks and on the midribs of the leaflets; and its\r\nflowers, which are whitish and strong scented, are borne in simple or\r\ncompound racemes. Its Cinghalese name is \"Koodoomirris-wel.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSIMARUBACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMADERA INDICA, _Gaertn._\r\n\r\nAll parts of this tree partake of the excessively bitter qualities\r\ncommon to the order. The decoction of the rasped wood has recently been\r\nextensively and successfully employed in Ceylon, in the treatment of\r\nintermittent fever, and is recommended to be given in combination with\r\nMyrobalan galls. The wood is of a pale colour, resembling quassia-wood,\r\nand is very light. The tree is indigenous to Ceylon, and also to the\r\nIndian peninsula, and is the \"Karin-njotti\" of Rheede. It attains a\r\nconsiderable size, and has oblong-elliptical, alternate leaves, and\r\nlong, pendulous, compressed flower-stalks, divided at the top into a\r\nmany-flowered umbel. The bark, called \"Niepa bark,\" also possesses\r\nfebrifugal properties.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHAMNACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nZIZYPHUS JUJUBA, _Lam._ (= _Rhamnus Jujuba_, Linn.)\r\n\r\nThe root of this common Indian tree is a reputed febrifuge, and an\r\ninfusion of it, combined with some warm seed, is said to be employed\r\nas such in the Moluccas, while the bark is used in diarrhœa. It is a\r\nsmall tree, with prickly branches, usually having the spines in pairs,\r\nand elliptical or oblong obtuse leaves, covered on the under side, as\r\nalso are the branches, with dense short tawny tomentum, and it bears\r\nsmall greenish-yellow flowers, which produce roundish, yellow, edible\r\nfruits about the size of cherries. Its Sanscrit name is \"Vadari,\" and\r\nits Bengalese \"Kool.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLEGUMINOSÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASSIA FISTULA, _Linn._ (= _Cathartocarpus Fistula_, Pers.).\r\n\r\nThe black, sweet-tasted pulp contained in the long cylindrical\r\npipe-like pods of this common tropical plant is well known as a gentle\r\nlaxative medicine; and its roots are reputed to be an excellent\r\nfebrifuge. It is the \"Sonali\" of the Bengalese, the \"Amultas\" of the\r\nHindus, and the \"Ahalla\" of the Cinghalese, and is a moderately large\r\ntree, with very long pinnate leaves, and loose drooping racemes of\r\nbright-yellow fragrant flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUILANDINA BONDUCELLA, _Linn._ (= _Cæsalpinia Bonducella_, Fleming).\r\n\r\nThe seeds and bark, but particularly the former, have an intensely\r\nbitter taste, and are supposed to possess powerful tonic virtues.\r\nThe seeds, called Bonduc nuts, are lead or ash coloured and most\r\nexcessively hard. Their cotyledons, powdered and combined with spices\r\nor other medicinal substances, are prescribed with beneficial results\r\nin intermittent fever. The root is also said to be a good tonic in\r\ndyspeptic complaints; in fact, all parts of the plant are reputed to\r\npossess medicinal properties. The plant is a prickly, trailing shrub,\r\nwith abruptly twice-pinnate leaves, each pinna consisting of from five\r\nto eight pairs of oval leaflets, and bears racemes of rusty-yellow\r\nflowers. The Tamuls call it \"Kalichikai;\" the Telingas \"Getsakaia;\"\r\nthe Hindus \"Cat-caleyi\" and \"Natacaranja;\" and the Cinghalese\r\n\"Koombooroo-wel.\" It is a common plant throughout the tropics of both\r\nhemispheres.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHASEOLUS TRILOBUS, _Roth._ (= _Dolichos trilobus_, Linn.).\r\n\r\nAinslie says that \"this plant was brought to Dr. F. Hamilton in Bahar,\r\nwhere he was informed by the Vytians of that district that the fresh\r\nherb was given in decoction in cases of irregular fever.\" It is a\r\nprocumbent, spreading, herbaceous plant, with leaves composed of three\r\nroundish, entire, or three-lobed leaflets on long stalks, and bears a\r\nfew pea-like flowers at the ends of long ascending stalks.\r\n\r\n\r\nORMOCARPUM SENNOIDES, _D. C._ (= _Hedysarum sennoides_, Willd.).\r\n\r\nA shrub with glutinous hairy shoots, unequally pinnate leaves, and\r\nshort axillary racemes bearing a few pea-like flowers, producing\r\njointed pods. The decoction of the roots of this shrub, which is called\r\n\"Caat Morungie\" in the Tamul language, and \"Adivie moonaga\" in Telinga,\r\nis prescribed by the native physicians as a tonic and stimulant in\r\nfevers, and a liniment made of the powdered bark and sesamum oil is\r\napplied externally in paralysis and lumbago.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMBRETACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nTERMINALIA TOMENTOSA, _W. et A._ (= _Terminalia alata_, Roth.).\r\n\r\nThis is a large tree with deeply-cracked bark, and nearly opposite,\r\nlinear, oblong, obtuse leaves, somewhat cordate at the base, crenulate,\r\nand clothed with pubescence underneath. It is the \"Peea-sal\" or \"Usan\"\r\nof the Bengalese; the \"Nella madoo\" of the Telingas; and the \"Aans\"\r\nof the Hindus. The reddish-brown, cracked bark has a strong but not\r\nunpleasant astringent taste, and is classed amongst the febrifuge\r\nmedicines by the native doctors: powdered and mixed with oil it is\r\nemployed in apthæ.\r\n\r\n\r\nMYRTACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYZYGIUM CARYOPHYLLIFOLIUM, _D. C._ (= _Calyptranthes\r\ncaryophyllifolia_, Willd.).\r\n\r\n\"Nawel\" of the Tamuls; \"Nereddie\" of the Telingas; and \"Madang\" of\r\nthe Cinghalese. The thick, brownish-coloured bark of this tree has an\r\nastringent, slightly aromatic taste, and a decoction of it is sometimes\r\nprescribed by native doctors in fevers and bowel complaints, and is\r\nalso employed as a wash for foul ulcers. It has been recommended as a\r\ntanning substance, but it does not possess sufficient astringency to\r\nrender it suitable for that purpose. The tree has smooth, entire leaves\r\nof an oblong-lanceolate shape and attenuated at the base, and bears\r\ncymose panicles of flowers upon the old branches, producing little\r\nedible fruits about the size of peas.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARRINGTONIACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARRINGTONIA RACEMOSA, _Roxb._ (= _Eugenia racemosa_, Linn.).\r\n\r\n\"Cadapum\" (Tam.); \"Kamtee\" (Tel.); and \"Deya-midella\" (Cing.). Ainslie\r\nsays that the reddish-coloured bark of the Cadapum is supposed\r\nto possess virtues similar to those of Chinchona bark. Medicinal\r\nproperties are also ascribed to the root and seed, both of which\r\nhave a bitter though not unpleasant taste. It is a large tree, with\r\ncuneate-oblong, acuminate, serrulate leaves, crowded together towards\r\nthe ends of the branches, and long pendulous racemes of large flowers,\r\nproducing ovate, bluntly quadrangular fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUCURBITACEÆ.\r\n\r\nZANONIA INDICA, _Linn._\r\n\r\nMr. Thwaites says that the Cinghalese value this plant as a febrifuge,\r\nand call it \"Wal-rasakinda.\" It is also found in India, and is the\r\n\"Penar-valli\" of Rheede's Hortus Malabaricus. The plant is a climber,\r\nsupporting itself by means of tendrils, and has alternate, elliptical,\r\npointed leaves, slightly cordate at the base, and axillary racemes of\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRICHOSANTHES CUCUMERINA, _Linn._\r\n\r\nThis is another cucurbitaceous plant much used by the Cinghalese as a\r\nfebrifuge, and from the experiments made with it in the hospitals at\r\nBadulla it appears to possess considerable efficacy. It is astringent\r\nand contains a bitter principle, which it yields to boiling water, and\r\nis therefore recommended to be used in the form of an infusion, made\r\nwith the dried stem and leaves. The plant is called \"Doommaala\" by\r\nthe Cinghalese, and is very common both in Ceylon and India. It is an\r\nannual climbing plant, with three-cleft tendrils, and broadly-cordate,\r\nangular or lobed leaves toothed along the edges. Its seeds are used in\r\nbowel complaints.\r\n\r\n\r\nUMBELLIFERÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDROCOTYLE ASIATICA, _Linn._\r\n\r\nThe Asiatic Pennywort has recently been discovered to be a valuable\r\nremedy in leprosy, scrofula, venereal, and other complaints. The native\r\ndoctors, however, have hitherto considered it serviceable only in bowel\r\ncomplaints and fevers, administering it in the form of an infusion of\r\nthe toasted leaves in combination with fenugreek. It has a bitter,\r\npungent, disagreeable taste, and when bruised gives off a peculiar\r\noffensive odour. The active principle of the plant is said to be due to\r\na thick pale-yellow oil or extract, which has been called _Vellarine_,\r\nfrom the Tamul name of the plant, \"Vullarei.\" Its Telinga name is\r\n\"Babassa;\" its Hindu, \"Thulkura;\" and its Cinghalese, \"Heen-gotookola.\"\r\nBy the latter people it is used as an anthelmintic. Though named\r\n_Asiatica_ by botanists, it is by no means confined to that continent,\r\nbut is spread very generally throughout the tropics. It has creeping\r\nstems, and tufts of roundish kidney-shaped leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHINCHONACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYMENODYCTION EXCELSUM, _Wall._ (= _Cinchona excelsa_, Roxb.)\r\n\r\nRoxburgh supposed this tree to belong to the same genus as the Peruvian\r\nbarks, but no species of true _Chinchona_ has ever been found wild in\r\nthe Eastern hemisphere. The present tree grows to a large size and\r\nyields a thick bark, the inner coatings of which possess the bitterness\r\nand astringency of the real Peruvian bark, especially when fresh; but\r\nthe bitterness, though more durable, is not so quickly communicated to\r\nthe taste. It is called \"Bundaroo\" by the Telingas.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERBESINA CINEREA, _Less._ (= _Conyza cinerea_, Linn.).\r\n\r\nA low-growing annual plant, widely spread throughout the tropics of the\r\nold world, and considered by the Hindus to possess medicinal virtues, a\r\ndecoction of the entire herb being administered in febrile affections\r\nin order to promote perspiration. It is the \"Seera shengalaneer\" of the\r\nTamuls, and the \"Gherutti Kamma\" of the Telingas.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUCKLANDIA COSTUS, _Falc._\r\n\r\nIn an elaborate memoir upon this plant, Dr. Falconer has shown it\r\nto be the source of the celebrated \"Costus\" of the ancients, which\r\nwas previously referred to the _Costus Arabicus_, Linn. (= _Costus\r\nspeciosus_, Sm.), a plant belonging to the order _Zingiberaceæ_. It\r\nis a gregarious herbaceous plant with a perennial root sending up\r\nannual erect stems six or seven feet high, bearing large, somewhat\r\nlyrate pinnatifid leaves. Costus-root is collected in large quantities\r\nin Cashmere, but the only use made of it there is for perfuming bales\r\nof shawls, and thus protecting them from insects, the great bulk of\r\nit being exported to China and Persia, in both of which countries it\r\nis highly esteemed as a medicine, the Persian doctors regarding it\r\nas an efficacious remedy in nearly all the ills human nature is heir\r\nto. Ainslie says that the native practitioners in India prescribe an\r\ninfusion of it as a stomachic and tonic, and also in the advanced\r\nstages of typhus fever. In Cashmere it is called \"Koot,\" which agrees\r\nwith the Arabic \"Koost:\" in Bengal it is known by the name of \"Putchuk.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEMILIA SONCHIFOLIA, _D. C._ (= _Cacalia sonchifolia_, Linn.).\r\n\r\n\"Shudimudi\" of the Bengalese, or \"Kadoo-para\" of the Cinghalese. An\r\nannual, with erect or spreading, branching stems, and variously shaped\r\nleaves, the lower ones being usually lyrate, and the upper more or less\r\namplexicaul, with blunt or sharp auricles. On the Malabar coast the\r\nnative practitioners, according to Rheede, consider a decoction of this\r\nplant to possess antifebrile qualities.\r\n\r\n\r\nEBENACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIOSPYROS EMBRYOPTERIS, _Pers._ (= _Embryopteris glutinifera_, Roxb.).\r\n\r\nAn American species of _Diospyros_ (_D. Virginiana_, Linn.) is\r\nemployed as a febrifuge by rustic practitioners in the United States,\r\nand O'Shaughnessy states that the bark of the present tree has been\r\ngiven in India, but with doubtful results, in the treatment of\r\nintermittent fevers. It is well known as the Gaub-tree, and the viscid,\r\nexcessively astringent juice of its fruit is used for tanning, and\r\nfor paying the seams of boats. It is a middle-sized tree, with long\r\nelliptic-lanceolate, smooth, coriaceous leaves, and whitish flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPOCYNACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPHIOXYLON SERPENTINUM, _Willd._\r\n\r\n\"Chivan amelpodi\" in Tamul; \"Chota Chand\" in Hindostanee; \"Chandra\" in\r\nBengalee; \"Patalganni\" in Telinga; and \"Aikawaireya\" in Cinghalese.\r\nThe root of the Chandra is very bitter, and is administered by the\r\nTelinga and also by the Javanese doctors in the form of a decoction,\r\nas a remedy in fever cases. It is one of the numberless supposed\r\nremedies for the bites of venomous snakes, but, as in many other\r\nsimilar instances, its virtues are fanciful, and its great reputation\r\nis probably ascribable to the old doctrine of _signatures_, the plant\r\nbeing a climber and having a twining stem.\r\n\r\n\r\nWRIGHTIA ANTIDYSENTERICA, _R. Br._ (= _Nerium antidysentericum_, Linn.).\r\n\r\nThe bark of this species of _Wrightia_ is included in some European\r\nworks on Materia Medica under the name of Tellicherry or Conessi\r\nbark. It has long enjoyed a high reputation in India as a tonic and\r\nfebrifuge; but other parts of the plant likewise appear to possess\r\nsimilar properties, a decoction of the long oat-like seeds being\r\nemployed in ardent fever. The bark is also given in dysentery. Among\r\nthe Tamuls it goes by the name of \"Veppalei,\" while the Hindus call it\r\n\"Curayia,\" and the Telingas \"Pala codija.\" It is a small tree producing\r\na white ivory-like wood, which has been tried for engraving purposes,\r\nbut found unsuitable on account of it not being of even quality\r\nthroughout. It has obovate-oblong, shortly acuminate, smooth leaves,\r\nand nearly terminal corymbs of jasmine-like flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\nASCLEPIADACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALOTROPIS GIGANTEA, _R. Br._ (= _Asclepias gigantea_, Linn.).\r\n\r\nVarious parts of the Yercum-plant have long been employed for medicinal\r\npurposes by the native doctors, and experiments made by Anglo-Indian\r\npractitioners have proved that the inner bark of the root, called Mudar\r\nbark, is a valuable remedy in leprosy, and that it may also be given\r\nwith advantage in several other complaints, including intermittent and\r\nother fevers. An elastic gum and a valuable fibre are also obtained\r\nfrom the plant. There are two varieties of Yercum, one with white and\r\nthe other with purple flowers, the former forming a tree fifteen or\r\ntwenty feet high, and the latter a shrub.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOGANIACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRYCHNOS NUX-VOMICA, _Linn._\r\n\r\nAccording to Roxburgh the exceedingly bitter wood of the Nux Vomica\r\nis employed as a remedy in fevers of the intermittent kind, and also\r\nfor the cure of snake-bites, when that of the next species cannot be\r\nobtained. The poisonous bark is commonly sold in the Indian bazaars in\r\nplace of the febrifuge \"Rohuna bark,\" which is in reality the produce\r\nof _Soymida febrifuga_. It is the false Angostura bark of our Materia\r\nMedica. Nux Vomica seeds have also been administered with some benefit\r\nin intermittent fever. The _Strychnos Nux-Vomica_ forms a small tree,\r\nhas oval, entire, shining leaves, strongly marked with from three to\r\nfive longitudinal nerves, and bears small corymbs of greenish-white\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRYCHNOS COLUBRINA, _Linn._\r\n\r\nThe \"Naga musadi\" of the Telingas, or \"Koochilaluta\" of the Bengalese.\r\nThe wood of this species is greatly esteemed by the natives as a remedy\r\nfor snake-bites, and is also given in cases of intermittent fever.\r\nIt is a climbing shrub with thick woody tendrils, elliptic-oblong,\r\nblunt-pointed, three-nerved leaves, and small corymbs of yellowish\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTIANACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPHELIA CHIRATA, _Griseb._ (= _Gentiana Chirayta_, Roxb., and\r\n_Agathotes Chirayta_, Don.).\r\n\r\nThe name \"Chirata\" or \"Chirayta,\" by which this plant is commonly known\r\nin India, is derived from the Sanscrit \"Kirataticta.\" The dried stems\r\nof the Chirata have long been famed amongst the natives of India as a\r\ntonic and febrifuge; and they have also gained considerable reputation\r\namongst European practitioners in India, who, however, have found them\r\nto be more efficacious in the cure of intermittent fever when employed\r\nin combination with the seeds of the _Guilandina Bonducella_, mentioned\r\nabove. It is an annual plant, two or three feet high, with smooth round\r\nstems and opposite, ovate or somewhat cordate, acuminate leaves, marked\r\nwith from five to seven nerves, and bears yellow flowers. Chirata is\r\nincluded in the Edinburgh Pharmacopœia.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPHELIA ANGUSTIFOLIA, _Don._ (= _Swertia angustifolia_, Ham.).\r\n\r\nThe stems of this species are called \"Pukaree Chirata\" in the\r\nHimalayas, and are substituted for the true Chirata. The species is\r\ndistinguished by its stems being somewhat four-sided, by its much\r\nnarrower, sharper-pointed, obscurely three-nerved, short-stalked\r\nleaves, and by its white, violet-spotted flowers. Both this and the\r\ntrue Chirata are natives of the Himalayas.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPHELIA ELEGANS, _Wight._\r\n\r\nIt has recently been discovered that the stems of this South Indian\r\nspecies are made up into bundles in the same manner as the Himalayan\r\nChiratas, with which they have hitherto been confounded in the\r\nbazaars. The plant, however, has a different native name, being called\r\n\"Salaras\" or \"Salajit\" by the inhabitants of the Pulney hills; but it\r\nis considered equally efficacious as a febrifuge. It has obsoletely\r\nfour-sided stems, narrow, ovate-lanceolate, sessile, three-nerved\r\nleaves, tapering to a slender point, and beautiful pale-blue flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALVADORACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALVADORA, _sp._\r\n\r\nA decoction of the bark of a species of _Salvadora_ is recommended by\r\nHindu doctors in cases of low fever, and as a tonic. Great confusion,\r\nhowever, exists among the species of this genus, and it is therefore\r\nuncertain which one is thus employed. Ainslie mentions _Salvadora\r\nPersica_, but it is very doubtful whether that species is found in any\r\npart of India.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORDIACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORDIA MYXA, _Linn._\r\n\r\nTonic and febrifuge properties are ascribed to the bark of this tree,\r\nit being, according to Horsfield, one of the chief remedies used in\r\nfevers by the Javanese, who call it \"Kendal.\" It is a small tree\r\nwith rounded branches, ovate leaves, smooth on the upper surface\r\nbut roughish underneath, and usually terminal panicles of flowers,\r\nproducing yellow, sweet-tasted pulpy fruits about the size of cherries.\r\nIn the Tamul language it is called \"Vidi marum;\" \"Nekra\" in Telinga;\r\n\"Lesura\" in Hindostanee; and \"Loloo\" in Cinghalese.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLANACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLANUM XANTHOCARPUM, _Schrad. et Wendl._ (= _Solanum Jacquini_,\r\nWilld.).\r\n\r\nThere are two varieties of this plant, one of which was formerly\r\nconsidered a distinct species, and named _Solanum Jacquini_. All parts\r\nof the latter variety are used medicinally, and it is one of the fever\r\nremedies employed by the Cinghalese, who call it \"Kattoo-wel-battoo.\"\r\nIt is a decumbent, spreading annual plant, armed with numerous long\r\nwhite prickles, and has sinuately-pinnatifid prickly leaves.

It is a\r\nlittle creeping plant, common in moist places throughout the tropics\r\nof both hemispheres, and has obovate-cuneate leaves, bearing solitary\r\nlong-stalked pale-blue flowers in their axils.

The entire\r\nplant is employed, the intensely bitter principle being found in all\r\nparts of it. It is an annual, with stiff quadrangular stems from one\r\nto two feet high, bearing smooth lanceolate leaves, attenuated at the\r\nbase. In the Telinga language it is called \"Nella vemoo;\" in Bengalese,\r\n\"Kala-megh;\" in Hindustanee, \"Calapnath;\" and in Tamul, \"Kiriat,\" hence\r\nthe common Indian name of the plant, Creat or Creyat.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICIA ADHATODA, _Linn._ (= _Adhatoda Vasica_, Nees ab Essen.)\r\n\r\nThe flowers, leaves, and roots have a bitterish and somewhat aromatic\r\ntaste, and are supposed to possess antispasmodic properties. An\r\ninfusion of them, especially of the flowers, is given to prevent\r\nthe return of rigour in intermittent fever. In Ceylon it is used as\r\nan expectorant for children. The Bengalese call the plant \"Bakus;\"\r\nthe Tamuls, \"Adhatodey;\" the Cinghalese, \"Paawetta;\" the Telingas,\r\n\"Adasara;\" and in Sanscrit it is called \"Vasica\" or \"Uroos.\" It forms\r\na tree fifteen or twenty feet high, with elliptic oblong leaves,\r\nattenuated to both ends, and pale-coloured flowers with purple stripes\r\nand rusty spots.\r\n\r\n\r\nLABIATÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nOCIMUM SANCTUM, _Linn._\r\n\r\nThe Tamul physicians prescribe a decoction of the root of this common\r\nIndian species of Basil in fever cases, and the juice of the leaves in\r\ncatarrhal affections. The Brahmins consider the plant sacred to Vishnu,\r\nand cultivate it in the vicinity of temples, while the Malays strew it\r\nupon the graves of their departed friends. The whole plant generally\r\nhas a purplish tinge, and grows about a foot high: it has long-stalked,\r\ndowny, oval leaves, toothed along the edges, and small pale-purple\r\nflowers.

BY WILLIAM\r\n  G. McIVOR, ESQ., SUPERINTENDENT OF CHINCHONA-CULTIVATION IN THE\r\n  NEILGHERRY HILLS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rearing Seeds._--THE first sowing of imported seeds took place in\r\nthe beginning of February 1860. No certain data being given for the\r\ntreatment of Chinchona-seeds, our first operations were necessarily\r\nexperimental, and a good number of seeds were lost by being sown in too\r\nretentive a soil, and supplied with what, to Chinchona-seeds, proved\r\nto be an excess of moisture; the greatest success we obtained in our\r\nfirst attempts was with the use of a soil composed almost entirely of\r\nburned earth, and of this sowing nearly sixty per cent. germinated, the\r\ntemperature of the earth being about 70°. The number of days required\r\nbefore germination took place in the several sowings varied from\r\nsixty-two to sixty-eight. The seedlings made but little progress for\r\nthe first six weeks, but after that time they sprung into rapid growth,\r\naveraging from 1-1/4 to 2 inches per mensem.\r\n\r\nSeeds of the valuable Chinchona Condaminea, received on the 16th\r\nFebruary 1862, were sown on the same day in a very light open soil\r\ncomposed of a beautifully open sort of sand, with a very small\r\nadmixture of leaf-mould. Our experience with the first seeds having\r\nestablished beyond all doubt that the Chinchonas are very impatient of\r\nany excess of moisture, particular care was taken in the preparation\r\nof the soil used in this sowing. The earth was in the first instance\r\nexposed to the sun for two or three days and thoroughly dried, it\r\nwas then heated to about 212° in order to destroy all grubs or larva\r\nof insects; after being allowed to cool, it was brought into the\r\npotting-shed and watered sufficiently to make it moist, but only to\r\nthat degree of moisture that the particles of soil would not adhere\r\ntogether on being pressed firmly with the hand, that is, the earth on\r\nbeing laid down was sufficiently dry to break and fall into its usual\r\nform. With the soil in this state the pots were filled, the surface\r\nlightly pressed down, and the seeds sown thereon, being lightly covered\r\nwith a sprinkling of sand. The pots were then placed on a slight bottom\r\nheat of about 72°. These were never watered in the strict sense of the\r\nword; when the surface got dry they were slightly sprinkled with a fine\r\nsyringe just sufficient to damp the surface, but never to penetrate\r\nthe soil. Under this treatment the seeds began to germinate very\r\nvigorously on the sixteenth day after sowing, and now, 17th March 1862,\r\nor twenty-nine days after sowing, upwards of sixty per cent. of the\r\nwhole of the perfect seeds sown have germinated, and we may fairly hope\r\nto rear over ninety per cent. of this sowing. I may, however, observe\r\nthat these seeds possessed the great advantage of being forwarded to\r\nIndia in a letter, and thus they were never subjected to the damaging\r\neffects produced on seeds sent out in air-tight parcels. The reason of\r\nthis is the want of a circulation of air through the packets, and a\r\nconsequent deposit of moisture on the interior of the outer covering\r\nby every increase and decrease of temperature on the voyage. As soon\r\nas the seeds germinate they are carefully pricked out into fresh pots\r\n(the soil being prepared as before described for the seeds). This must\r\nof course be done with very great care, the radicle being carefully\r\ncovered with soil, while the seed and cotyledons are kept above the\r\nsurface. In this way about twenty-five seedlings are transplanted into\r\na four-inch pot, and treated in every respect the same as the seeds;\r\nthat is, they are never watered, the soil being merely sprinkled as\r\nbefore stated to keep it in that medium state of moisture in which\r\nit was first put into the pots. This prevents the damping off of the\r\nseedlings, to which they are very liable when treated otherwise; it\r\nalso greatly facilitates their growth and the formation of roots,\r\nthe soil being so perfectly open that it is readily affected by\r\nthe atmosphere, and thus kept in the most favourable condition for\r\npromoting vegetation. When treated in this way our seedlings have made\r\nan average growth in ten months of over eighteen inches, the growth\r\nbeing much more rapid towards the end of the ten months than in the\r\nearlier stages.\r\n\r\n_Propagation._--As soon as the seedlings and imported plants attained\r\nsufficient size, they were propagated by being layered; in this way it\r\nwas found that they rooted readily in about six weeks or two months,\r\nand threw out shoots from every bud; and not only this, but many\r\nlatent buds were developed, and a fine growth of young wood produced\r\nfor succeeding layers and cuttings. The principle of layering, being\r\nso well known to English gardeners, requires no detail; but in the\r\nChinchona-plants it was found that the layers were very liable to\r\n_bleed_, and this not only weakened the plants but retarded the\r\nformation of roots; this we found to be remedied in a great degree by\r\ninserting in the cut a triangular piece of perfectly dry broken porous\r\nbrick. An abundance of young wood being produced, we proceeded to\r\npropagate by cuttings, the earth being prepared with great care, the\r\nsame as for the seeds, with the exception of not being heated. The ends\r\nof the cuttings are placed upon pieces of perfectly dry porous brick,\r\naround the sides of the pots. They are then placed on a bottom heat of\r\n75° or 80°; and, with this treatment, young and tender wood roots in\r\nabout three weeks or one month, older wood in about six weeks to two\r\nmonths. With cuttings of the young wood our loss has not exceeded two\r\nper cent., and with older wood about ten per cent.\r\n\r\nOur object being to produce the largest number of plants in the\r\nshortest possible space of time, it was found that cuttings and layers\r\nrequired more wood than could be conveniently spared, and it was\r\nresolved to try the propagation by buds; in this respect the success\r\nhas been most satisfactory. The secret of success entirely lies in the\r\namount of moisture given; if in excess, they rot immediately, but, if\r\nsufficient care is exercised in reference to moisture, the losses will\r\nnot exceed three or four per cent. Six C. Calisaya buds put in on the\r\n30th January all rooted in forty-one days. It may be observed that it\r\nis not necessary that a leaf should be attached to the bud: this is no\r\ndoubt an advantage, although we have struck many buds of the red bark\r\nwithout leaves, and also a few of the Calisayas.\r\n\r\nIt ought to be explained that the reason why the earth is brought to a\r\nmedium state of moisture before being put into the pots is because it\r\nis never afterwards watered to such an extent as to render it really\r\nwet, being in fact just kept in that state of moisture in which it was\r\noriginally placed in the pots, and this uniform and medium state of\r\nmoisture is more easily retained by the pots being plunged in beds of\r\nearth. The reason why we found this system necessary was, that, when\r\nthe soil was watered in the usual way after the seedlings or cuttings\r\nwere placed in it, it was found, from its expansion and adhesion by\r\nthe action of the water, that its particles were forced far too close\r\ntogether to be beneficial to the growth of the plants, and in many\r\ninstances this proved to be injurious, vastly retarding their growth.\r\n\r\nIn the nurseries in the open air the same principle of cultivation\r\nand propagation as that described above has been adopted, and, with\r\nreference to the condition of the plants and layers, with nearly equal\r\nsuccess, the period of rooting of the layers being from two months to\r\nten weeks, while cuttings take from two to three months, the average\r\nloss being about fifteen per cent.: this occurs from the impossibility,\r\nin the open air, of keeping a uniform state of the atmosphere around\r\nthe cuttings. With layers this is not so important, as they root quite\r\nas surely (though slower) as in the propagating-houses, and flourish\r\nequally well.\r\n\r\n_Formation of Plantations._--The mode of cultivation of these plants\r\nlikely to prove the most advantageous being uncertain, it was resolved\r\nin May and June of 1861 to place out a number of plants under different\r\nconditions of shade, exposure, &c., and the result has been that the\r\nplants placed without the protection of living shade have made the\r\nmost satisfactory progress, and borne the dry season without the least\r\ninjury. The plants placed under living shade were found to be damaged\r\nin some degree during the rains by the incessant drip, but on the\r\nweather clearing up they threw out new leaves and quickly recovered.\r\nNine months after planting, or at the end of our dry season, these\r\nplants were found to be suffering considerably from the drought; and\r\non taking a few of them up, it was found that the holes in which these\r\nChinchonas were planted had become entirely filled by the fibres of\r\nthe roots of the living trees in their neighbourhood, which had drawn\r\nup the whole of the moisture and nourishment from the soil in which\r\nthe Chinchona-plants were placed. In putting the plants out, which\r\nwere placed in the open, we of course saw from the first that with the\r\nyoung plants we had to combat the bad effects of excessive evaporation\r\nduring our dry season, under a bright and scorching sun; we also saw\r\nthe injury likely to be done to the plants by radiation during bright\r\nand cloudless nights. To obviate these disadvantages the plants were\r\nsheltered on the approach of the dry season by a rough enclosure of\r\nbamboo-branches, with the leaves adhering to them, so as to give them\r\nsufficient shade both from the effects of evaporation and radiation.\r\nThe enclosure is left open on the north side, and enclosed on the\r\nsouth, east, and west; the sun's declination being south during the\r\ndry weather. The ground will not be impoverished by the roots of\r\nother trees, and the whole of its nourishment is preserved for the\r\nChinchona-plants. At the same time they will, by this treatment, be far\r\nmore efficiently protected from evaporation and radiation than they\r\nwould be by the use of living shade, whether caused by forest-trees or\r\nby the admixture of faster-growing plants. In addition to this shade\r\nof the branches of cut bamboos, the soil around the roots of some of\r\nthe young Chinchona-plants was covered one or two inches in thickness\r\nwith half-decayed leaves, and the plants thus treated show a very\r\ngreat luxuriance, which is not exceeded by any of the plants in our\r\npropagating-houses. To ascertain the cause of this luxuriance a few\r\nof the plants were recently examined, and although at the end of the\r\ndry season the soil about the roots was found to be perfectly moist;\r\nthousands of young rootlets of great strength were found to have been\r\nthrown into the covering of decayed leaves, so that it had become one\r\nmatted mass of beautiful white roots, many of them nearly the thickness\r\nof a crow-quill. On the strength of these observations we have resolved\r\nto place out this season seventy-five acres of Chinchona-plants in\r\ncleared land, and exactly under the conditions and treatment last\r\ndescribed; we also propose planting seventy-five acres under various\r\ndegrees of living shade, in which every attempt will be made to\r\nmitigate as much as possible the injurious effects of this system\r\nalready described. The cultivation of these plants being experimental,\r\nit is necessary that we should give every method of cultivation which\r\nappears reasonable a fair trial, and that only developed facts should\r\ninfluence us in giving preference to one method of cultivation over\r\nthat of another. The distances at which we have prepared to place\r\nthe plants are for the larger growing species from nine to ten feet\r\napart, for the sorts of medium size eight feet, and for the shrubby\r\nsorts seven feet: these distances are of course too close to admit\r\nof the plants attaining a full size, but we believe that it will be\r\nadvantageous to plant them close in the first instance, and thin them\r\nout afterwards. In order to illustrate the extreme growth of our\r\nplants, it is worthy of note that one or two of them, although not yet\r\ntwelve months old, have attained a height of about five feet by three\r\nand a half feet in diameter through the branches; we may therefore\r\nconclude that the plants will in about two years fairly cover the\r\nground if placed at the distances given above. When they begin to crowd\r\nand impede the growth of each other they will of course be thinned\r\nout and pruned; and it is anticipated that a good supply of bark may\r\nbe obtained by these means in from eight to twelve years, or perhaps\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\n_Ootacamund, 19th March, 1862._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nP.S. On the 5th of April the seeds of _C. Condaminea_ were coming up\r\nplentifully, and 4193 seedlings had already been transplanted. 100\r\nseedlings of _C. crispa_ had also come up. The seeds of _C. Condaminea_\r\nwere coming up at the rate of 500 a-day. At this date there were 25,000\r\nChinchona-plants on the Neilgherry hills, and all the species, except\r\n_C. lancifolia_, were increasing rapidly. It will be some time before\r\nMr. McIvor will be able to propagate from the latter species, owing\r\nto the very unhealthy state in which the plants arrived from Java. In\r\nApril 50 acres of ground were prepared for planting at the Dodabetta\r\nsite, and 70 acres at Neddiwuttum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX E.\r\n\r\n  NOTE ON THE EXPORT TRADE IN PERUVIAN BARK FROM THE PORTS OF SOUTH\r\n  AMERICA, AND ON THE IMPORT TRADE INTO ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nARICA, the port for the \"_Calisaya_\" bark from Bolivia. In 1859\r\nthe export of bark amounted to 192,600 lbs., valued at 17,334_l._;\r\nand between January and November, 1860, to 388,800 lbs., valued at\r\n35,000_l._\r\n\r\nISLAY, another port for the \"_Calisaya_\" bark from Bolivia. In 1859 the\r\nexport of bark amounted to 146,000 lbs., valued at 13,460_l._ (of which\r\n136,500 lbs. went to England, and 9500 lbs. to France); and between\r\nJanuary and November, 1860, to 107,700 lbs., valued at 9770_l._\r\n\r\nPAYTA, the port for the \"_Crown_\" barks from Loxa. The price of bark\r\nat this port for the last nine years has been twenty-four dollars the\r\ncwt.; but during the last year the price has risen to thirty dollars,\r\nwhere it is likely to remain for some time. The usual annual export\r\namounts to 140,000 lbs., the actual quantity shipped in 1861, and it is\r\nvalued at 8400_l._\r\n\r\nGUAYAQUIL, the port for the \"_Red_\" bark and the \"_West Coast\r\nCarthagena_\" bark. The quantity exported varies very much in different\r\nyears, the price being at present about twenty dollars the cwt. In 1857\r\nthe export of bark amounted to 516,600 lbs.; in 1858 to 533,300 lbs.;\r\nin 1859 to 201,700 lbs.; in 1860 to 91,500 lbs.; and in 1861 to 443,700\r\nlbs.; valued in the last of these years at 17,748_l._\r\n\r\nThe \"_Grey_\" barks were exported, in former years, from CALLAO, and in\r\nsmall quantities from HUANCHACO and LAMBAYEQUE, but of late years none\r\nhas been exported.\r\n\r\nThe \"_Carthagena_\" barks from New Granada are exported from the ports\r\nof CARTHAGENA and SANTA MARTHA, and also from the little port of TUMACO\r\non the Pacific coast. From 1849 to 1855 great quantities were exported,\r\nbut in the latter year the supply began to fail. The existing civil\r\nwar in New Granada has still further injured this trade. No reliable\r\naccount of the export of bark from the above ports of New Granada has\r\nbeen received.\r\n\r\nFrom the four ports of ARICA, ISLAY, PAYTA, and GUAYAQUIL the average\r\namount of bark annually exported may be taken at 912,900 lbs., valued\r\nat 59,076_l._ Small quantities may come from other ports, of which no\r\nauthentic account has been obtained; so that the total amount annually\r\nexported from South America may be estimated at considerably over\r\n2,000,000 lbs.\r\n\r\nThere being no duty on the importation of Peruvian bark into England,\r\nthe returns of the amount imported are much less carefully kept than\r\nwas formerly the case. The returns, too, are in packages, and not in\r\nlbs. or cwts., and these packages vary in weight from 120 lbs. to 60\r\nlbs. The number of packages of Peruvian bark imported into England in\r\n1858 was 19,831; in 1859 the number was 10,651; in 1860 it was 10,456;\r\nand in 1861 it was 20,748. Taking the average of the weight of the\r\npackages at 80 lbs. each, the quantity imported into England during the\r\nlast four years would be 4,934,880 lbs., and in the year 1861 about\r\n1,659,840 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of Peruvian bark imported into England during the three\r\nmonths ending on March 31st, 1861, was reported to be 306,300 lbs.,\r\nand during the same period, in the present year, 310,700 lbs. At this\r\nrate the annual import would be a little over 1,200,000 lbs., which is\r\nprobably more correct than the above estimate from the packages.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON: PRINTED BY W.

Dr. Karsten is a careful\r\nobserver and a scientific botanist and chemist, and his observations\r\nform a very important addition to our knowledge of this subject.\r\n\r\n[60] _Report of the Administrador Don Ignacio Cavero, Semanario_, p.\r\n183.\r\n\r\n[61] 300 dried specimens, and 242 coloured drawings, sent in the ship\r\n'Buen Consejo.'\r\n\r\n[62] Namely:--\r\n\r\n  1. _C. lanceolata_        (_Cascarilla bobo amarillo_).\r\n  2. _C. purpurea_          (     \"     _de hoja morada_).\r\n  3. _C. ovata_             (     \"     _pata de gallareta_).\r\n  4. _C. nitida_            (     \"     _fino_).\r\n  5. _C. hirsuta_           (     \"     _fino delgado_).\r\n  6. _C. magnifolia_       {(     \"     _flor de Azahar_).\r\n                           {(     \"     _magnifolia--Wedd_).\r\n  7. _C. glandulifera_      (     \"     _negrilla_).\r\n\r\n[63] I have examined Pavon's dried specimens from Huanuco, now in the\r\nbotanical gardens at Madrid.\r\n\r\nThere are leaves of _C. lanceolata_, from the forests of Muña; leaves\r\nand capsules of _C. ovata_, some of the former very slightly cordate,\r\nfrom Panao and Pillao; leaves, flowers, and capsules of _C. purpurea_;\r\nand leaves and capsules of _C. nitida_, from Cuchero.\r\n\r\n[64] Ruiz published his _Quinologia_ in 1792.\r\n\r\n[65] At first, in the best years, as many as 25,000 arrobas of bark\r\nwere exported from the province of Huanuco, and some large fortunes\r\nwere made.--_Poeppig._ An arroba = 25 lbs.\r\n\r\n[66] _Mercurio Peruano._\r\n\r\n[67] A Peruvian who was for many years Director of the Cabinet of\r\nNatural History in Madrid, during the reign of Charles III.\r\n\r\n[68] _Reise in Peru, während der Jahre 1827-32_, von Eduard Poeppig,\r\nProfessor an der Universität zu Leipzig, ii. pp. 217-23, 257-64.\r\n\r\n[69] Stevenson, however, says that large quantities of bark were\r\nbrought from the woods east of Huamalies in 1825.--_Travels_, ii. p. 66.\r\n\r\n[70] Poeppig.

Dr.\r\nWeddell derives the name from the Quichua words _colli_ (red) and\r\n_saya_ (form); Poeppig from _colla_ (a remedy) and _salla_ (rocky\r\nground); Van Tschudi from _collisara_ (reddish maize). Dr. Laefdael,\r\nthe Judge of Caravaya, told me it came from _ccali_ (strong) and\r\n_sayay_ (become, or be thou). Calisaya is the name of a family of\r\nIndian Caciques in Caravaya, one of whom acted an important part in the\r\nrevolt of 1780-1. The plant may have been called after him.\r\n\r\n[76] The bark of _C. Calisaya_, known as \"yellow bark\" in commerce, was\r\nat first erroneously believed to come from _C. cordifolia_, because\r\nMutis had called the bark from that species _cascarilla amarilla_, or\r\n\"yellow bark.\" See p. 28.\r\n\r\n[77] This account of the Bolivian bark trade is from Dr. Weddell's\r\n_Voyage dans le Nord de Bolivie, et dans les partes voisines de Pérou_.\r\nParis, 1853.

I have caused these\r\nreports to be translated and circulated for the information of those\r\nwho are intrusted with, or interested in, the chinchona cultivation in\r\nIndia or Ceylon.\r\n\r\n[115] Mr. Spruce's remark on the eventual necessity of cultivating the\r\nchinchona tree is important. He says, \"I have seen enough of collecting\r\nthe products of the forests to convince me that _whatever vegetable\r\nsubstance is needful to man, he must ultimately cultivate the plant\r\nproducing it_.\"--_Report_, p. 83.\r\n\r\n[116] It appears, by a government return, that 2051 lbs. of quinine\r\nwere sent to India in 1856, and 1180 lbs. in 1857.\r\n\r\nThe _Friend of India_ of December 10th, 1860, however, quoting from\r\nthe _Lancet_, states that the consumption of quinine and bark in the\r\ngovernment hospitals in India in 1857-8 was 6815 lbs., and that in\r\n1858-9 it amounted to 5087 lbs. The writer of the article adds that\r\nthe government druggists in India sell quinine at 1_l._ an ounce; but,\r\ntaking the cost of an ounce of quinine at 10_s._, the expenditure\r\non this medicine, according to the above figures, would amount to\r\n54,520_l._ in 1857-8, and to 40,696_l._ in 1858-9!\r\n\r\n[117] Nevertheless we now have plants of _C. lancifolia_, the species\r\nwhich should have been procured from New Granada, thriving in India.\r\nThey have been received from Java, in exchange for other species, and\r\nwere originally raised from seeds sent by Dr. Karsten.\r\n\r\n[118] When it was founded by General La Fuente, then Prefect of\r\nArequipa.--_Castelnau_, iii. p. 443.\r\n\r\n[119] There is anchorage for 20 or 25 vessels in 10 or 12 fathoms; but\r\nthere is always a rather heavy swell, so that a hawser is necessary to\r\nkeep a vessels bow to it, even in fine weather.\r\n\r\n[120] In the following proportions:--\r\n\r\n  To England             Alpaca wool    22,500 cwts  worth £192,729\r\n      \"                  Sheep's wool   18,669  \"      \"     67,306\r\n      \"                  Vicuña wool        72  \"      \"      1,537\r\n      \"                  Copper                        \"        333\r\n      \"                  Bark            1,365  \"      \"     12,383\r\n      \"                  Specie                              34,706\r\n  To France              Wool              877  \"      \"      1,886\r\n      \"                  Bark               95  \"      \"      1,077\r\n  To the United States   Wool            8,054  \"      \"     24,884\r\n                                                           --------\r\n                                                           £336,842\r\n                                                           --------\r\n\r\n[121] The analysis of this soil, by Dr. Forbes Watson, gave the\r\nfollowing result:--\r\n\r\n  Water, and a little organic matter     7.100\r\n  Silica, as silicate and as silex      59.800\r\n  Peroxide of iron                      12.100\r\n  Alumina                               12.300\r\n  Lime                                   4.100\r\n  Magnesia                               2.100\r\n  Soda                                   0.724\r\n  Chloride of sodium                     0.408\r\n  Phosphoric acid                        0.117\r\n  Carbonic acid\r\n  Sulphuric acid                         0.082\r\n                                       -------\r\n                                        99.681\r\n              Loss                        .319\r\n                                       -------\r\n                                       100.000\r\n                                       -------\r\n\r\n[122] \"Tambo\" is a Spanish corruption of the Quichua word _Tampu_, an\r\ninn or post-house.\r\n\r\n[123] Almost all the woollen clothing of the Peruvian Indians is now\r\nimported from Yorkshire, and their shirtings from Lowell.

But the miners kept\r\nback a third of the Indian's wages, nominally to form a fund to pay for\r\nhis return to his home at the end of his period of service.\r\n\r\n[166] The Marquis of Montes Claros derives the word _mita_ from the\r\nQuichua _mitta_, \"time,\" and says that the _mita_ was established to\r\nprevent idleness, and for the good of the Indians!--_Memorias_, i. p.\r\n21.\r\n\r\n[167] _Report of the Viceroy Prince of Esquilache_, 1620. This,\r\nhowever, is not quite clear: it is more probable that Indians were\r\nlawlessly torn from their homes to work in the mines when the _mita_ of\r\na seventh did not yield a sufficient number of labourers. In North Peru\r\nthe proportion was a sixth, and in Quito a fifth.\r\n\r\n[168] Montes Claros describes them as Indians domiciled on the estates\r\nor in the houses of Spaniards, like servants; their masters giving them\r\nfood, clothes, and a bit of land, and paying their tribute for them.\r\nLest the system should degenerate into slavery, the king, in a _cedula_\r\nof 1601, declared that they were free, and desired that this should be\r\nmade known to them.--_Memorias_, i. p. 27.\r\n\r\n[169] _Ordenanzas_, No. 34, 12, 140.\r\n\r\n[170] Especially in those of the Count of Alba de Liste in 1660.

I also\r\nobtained a copy of Areche's reply to Tupac Amaru, from a MS. in the\r\npublic library at Lima.\r\n\r\nWeddell has given an account of the insurrection of Tupac Amaru in his\r\n_Voyage dans le Nord de Bolivie_, chap. xv. p. 263-88. This chapter is\r\na résumé of the collection of original documents in the work of Angelis.\r\n\r\n[200] Information from Don Pablo Astete, aged 80, given to Gen. Miller\r\nat Cuzco in 1835. Astete's father had been an intimate friend of Tupac\r\nAmaru, but afterwards served against him.\r\n\r\n[201] Information from Dominga Bastidas, a cousin of Tupac Amaru's\r\nwife, given to Gen. Miller at Cuzco in 1835. She said that Micaela was\r\nalways considered to have been very beautiful; and added, that the sons\r\nof Tupac Amaru, when at college at Cuzco, spent the feast-days at her\r\nhouse. In 1835 she was a very old woman.\r\n\r\n[202] This description of Tupac Amaru is almost word for word as it was\r\ngiven to Gen. Miller by Don Pablo Astete, who well remembered him.\r\n\r\n[203] The inhabitants of Tungasuca, about 500 in number, were as\r\nremarkable for their agricultural industry in 1853, when I saw them, as\r\nthey formerly were as muleteers.\r\n\r\n[204] From a MS. at Lima, headed \"_En el Cuzco, Dec. 3, 1780_.\"\r\n\r\n[205] Inca Manco had two sons, Sayri Tupac and Tupac Amaru. Clara\r\nBeatriz Coya, daughter of Sayri Tupac, married Don Martin Garcia de\r\nLoyola, and had a daughter, Lorenza, created Marchioness of Oropesa\r\nand Countess of Alcanises, with remainder to the descendants of her\r\ngreat-uncle, Tupac Amaru. She married Don Juan Henriquez de Borja, but,\r\nin 1770, there were no descendants of this marriage, and the descendant\r\nof Tupac Amaru was the lawful heir to the marquisate.\r\n\r\nThe decision of the Royal Audience of Lima disposes of the statement\r\nof Baron Humboldt (_Political Essay_, i. p. 208), that \"the pretended\r\nInca was a Mestizo, and his true father a monk.\" Humboldt was certainly\r\nmisinformed, as there is not a shadow of grounds for the assertion.\r\nTupac Amaru's birth is never questioned in any of the documents in my\r\npossession, consisting of his sentence of death, proclamations, and\r\nletters from his enemies, in which no opportunity is lost of blackening\r\nhis memory.\r\n\r\n[206] _Despachos que el Exmo. Señor Principe de Esquilache, Virey de\r\nlos reynos del Peru, envio a su Magestad._ No. 6, p. 344. Lima, April\r\n16, 1618.--MS. in the National Library at Madrid, H. 53.\r\n\r\n[207] From the collection of Angelis.\r\n\r\n[208] Funes.\r\n\r\n[209] In my review of the language and literature of the Incas in\r\na former work (_Cuzco and Lima_, chap. vi.) I gave some translated\r\nextracts from the drama of _Ollantay_, and an abstract of the plot. I\r\nthen stated that it was an ancient play, which had been handed down\r\nfrom the time of the Incas; but I have since discovered that Dr.\r\nValdez was its author, although it contains several ancient songs and\r\nspeeches, and though the plot is undoubtedly ancient. I was led into\r\nthe error by the opinion expressed by the Peruvian antiquary, Mariano\r\nRivero,[210] a very high authority, that the drama had been handed down\r\nfrom the time of the Incas.\r\n\r\nThe original MS. is now in the possession of Don Narciso Cuentas, of\r\nTinta, the nephew and heir of Dr. Valdez; but there are numerous MS.\r\ncopies in Peru, and it has been printed at the end of Dr. Von Tschudi's\r\n_Kechua Sprache_.\r\n\r\nThere is a review of this Quichua drama of Dr. Valdez, in the _Museo\r\nErudito_ (Nos. 5 to 9), a periodical published at Cuzco in 1837, by the\r\neditor, Don José Palacios. He says that the story respecting Ollantay\r\nwas handed down by immemorial tradition, but that the drama was written\r\nby Dr. Valdez. The writer criticizes the plot, objecting that the\r\ntreason of Ollantay is rewarded, while the heroic conduct of Rumi-ñaui\r\nremains unnoticed. Palacios had inquired of Don Juan Hualpa, a noble\r\nCacique of Belem in Cuzco, and of the Caciques of San Sebastian and San\r\nBlas, who agreed in their account of the tradition, which was that the\r\nrebellion of Ollantay arose from the abduction of an _Aclla_ or Virgin\r\nof the Sun from her convent, but they had not heard her name, nor who\r\nshe was.\r\n\r\nThese particulars respecting the origin of the drama of _Ollantay_ may\r\nbe interesting to readers who have paid any attention to the history\r\nof the civilization of the Incas. Though not so ancient as I once\r\nsupposed, the drama is still very curious, because it contains songs\r\nand long passages of undoubted antiquity.\r\n\r\n[210] Antiquedades Peruanas, p. 116.\r\n\r\n[211] Two and a half leagues from Tinta, and two miles from Yanaoca.\r\n\r\n[212] Near the port of Islay, and westward of Cornejo point, the coast\r\nforms a shallow bay, in which is the small cove of Aranta, 13 miles\r\nfrom the valley of Quilca. Its capabilities as a port were personally\r\nexamined by the President Castilla three years ago.\r\n\r\n[213] One mile from Tungasuca.\r\n\r\n[214] A coat of arms was granted to the family of the Incas by Charles\r\nV., at Valladolid, in 1544.

But the\r\nabove account of the affair was given by the Inca himself to Don Miguel\r\nAndrade of Azangaro, and he denied positively that the church was set\r\non fire.--_Sublevacion de Tupac Amaru._ Angelis.\r\n\r\n[217] Landa, the Governor of Paucartambo, had formerly led an exploring\r\nexpedition into the montaña, in search of the great river of Madre de\r\nDios or Purus.--_Cuzco and Lima_, p. 263.\r\n\r\n[218] This Cacique Sahuaraura was the father of the late Dr. Justo\r\nSahuaraura, of Cuzco, who published a little genealogical work in\r\nParis, in 1850, in which he claimed descent from the Incas. I hear,\r\nhowever, that his genealogy is apocryphal. In 1835 he wrote to\r\nthe editor of the _Museo Erudito_ of Cuzco, offering to write the\r\ntraditions of his family in that periodical, as an Inca. A Dr. Gallego,\r\nof Cuzco, replied that no Inca was ever called Sahuaraura, but that the\r\nInca Rocca once had a servant of that name, and that he might possibly\r\nbe descended from him. This silenced Don Justo for a long time.\r\n(_Sahuay_, a flame; _raurac_, make. He had to light the Inca's fire).\r\n\r\n[219] Letter from Dr. Moscoso, Bishop of Cuzco, July 20,\r\n1782.--_Angelis._\r\n\r\n[220] In the collection of Angelis.\r\n\r\n[221] _Angelis_ and _Guzman_, MSS.\r\n\r\n[222] _Historia de lo acaecido en el Real Asunto de Paucartambo, en la\r\nrebelion sucitada por José Gabriel Tupac Amaru._ A manuscript account\r\nof the siege of Paucartambo, by Fray Raymundo Gonzalez, Religioso\r\nMercedario, written in 1782.

In 1806 Dr. Tadeo Garate, of La Paz,\r\nSecretary to Bishop Las Heras (afterwards Archbishop of Lima), was\r\nordered by the Viceroy Marquis of Aviles to publish a history of\r\nthe Rebellion of Tupac Amaru in 1780-1; and, to guard against the\r\npossibility of authentic counter-statements, this despatch was taken\r\nfrom the archives of Cuzco, and sent to La Paz in charge of an Indian\r\nstudent named Pasoscanki, who perused it on the road, and was so struck\r\nwith the magnanimity and heroism of his native prince, that he did not\r\ndeliver the papers. He afterwards emigrated to Buenos Ayres, and, in\r\n1812, went to England, and commissioned Mr. Wood, of Poppin's-court,\r\nFleet-street, to print Tupac Amaru's despatch; but, for want of funds,\r\nthis was not done, and, Pasoscanki returning to Buenos Ayres, the\r\npublication was abandoned. In 1828 the same printer was employed to\r\nprint the Spanish edition of Gen. Miller's _Memoirs_, and at that time\r\nthe despatch was found amongst some old papers in Mr. Wood's office.\r\nIt was finally published in an appendix to the Spanish edition of Gen.\r\nMiller's _Memoirs_.\r\n\r\n[225] Report of Gen. del Valle, Sept. 30, 1781, MS. Letter of Areche.\r\nMS., in the library at Lima.\r\n\r\n[226] This draft of an edict is amongst the papers in Angelis. It is\r\npossible, however, that it may have been forged by the Spaniards, in\r\norder to produce written evidence of the intentions of Tupac Amaru.\r\n\r\n[227] Tomas Parvina de Colquemarca, \"Justicia Mayor,\" and Felipe\r\nBermudez, a Spaniard, belonged to the \"Junta Privada,\" or Privy\r\nCouncil, of the Inca. Bermudez had acted as the Inca's secretary.\r\n\r\n[228] There is said to be a picture in the church at Tinta representing\r\nthis massacre.\r\n\r\n[229] He is said to have been dressed in Incarial robes, with the arms\r\nof the Incas embroidered in gold at the corners.\r\n\r\n[230] A list of the prisoners is given amongst the Angelis papers.\r\n\r\n[231] It is printed in the appendix to the Spanish edition of Gen.\r\nMiller's _Memoirs_, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[232] One account says that he was tortured until one arm was\r\ndislocated, by the _garruche_, by order of Matta Linares. _Guzman_ MSS.\r\n\r\n[233] Letter from Gen. del Valle, Sept. 30, 1781.\r\n\r\n[234] One of these was Dr. Don Toribio Carrasco, afterwards Cura of\r\nBelem in Cuzco, who, in 1835, mentioned the circumstance, and the\r\nimpression it had made, to Gen. Miller.\r\n\r\n[235] These executions, in all their revolting details, were certified\r\nby Juan Bautista Gamarra, public notary to the Cabildo of Cuzco, in a\r\ndocument dated May 20, 1781.\r\n\r\n[236] _Report of the Cabildo of Cuzco._\r\n\r\n[237] The edict, fixing the destinations of the different parts of each\r\nvictim, is printed amongst the papers in Angelis.\r\n\r\n[238] The Pizarros and their companions were angels of mercy when\r\ncompared with such vile wretches as Areche and Matta Linares; yet\r\nwe are told by one of his flatterers that \"the tender heart of the\r\nvisitador was filled with piety and humanity, and that early on the day\r\nafter the execution he went to the cathedral, and, having confessed and\r\npartaken of the sacrament, he paid for several masses for the souls of\r\nthe culprits, and heard them all on his knees, thus edifying the whole\r\ncity.\" Hypocritical hyæna!--_Guzman_ MSS.\r\n\r\n[239] When Señor Zea, of Bogota, was in Paris, Kotzebue undertook a\r\njourney on purpose to obtain information from him respecting Tupac\r\nAmaru, having conceived the idea of writing a tragedy founded on his\r\nrebellion. But Zea, being a Colombian, knew little or nothing about it.\r\n\r\nKotzebue, however, continued his inquiries respecting Peru, which\r\nresulted in his play _The Virgins of the Sun_, and hence Sheridan's\r\n_Pizarro_.\r\n\r\n[240] Orellana was a native of Cuenca, and descended from the great\r\nnavigator of the Amazons.\r\n\r\n[241] _Relacion del Gobernador de Puno, de sus expediciones, sitios,\r\ndefensa, y varios acaecimientos, hasta que despoblo la villa de orden\r\ndel Inspector y Commandante General Don José Antonio del Valle: corre\r\ndesde 16 Noviembre 1780, hasta 17 de Julio 1781._\r\n\r\n[242] During my stay at Puno I lived in the house which was occupied by\r\nOrellana during the siege.

One is that he excommunicated a priest for\r\nbetraying the secrets of the Indians told under the seal of confession;\r\nanother that he tried to save the lives of several Indian rebels;\r\nanother that he asked for a general pardon after the death of the Inca;\r\nanother that he permitted Mariano Tupac Amaru to celebrate the funeral\r\nof his father, &c. If these accusations were true, they all redound to\r\nthe bishop's honour; and it is to be regretted that he was so anxious\r\nto defend himself against them. At the end of his book there are some\r\nletters to him from Diego Tupac Amaru. \"_Inocencia justificada contra\r\nlos artificios de la calumnia.

He saw his\r\nfaithful wife die on board the ship, without being allowed length of\r\nchain enough to approach her. During an imprisonment of forty years at\r\nCeuta the sentries never relaxed their cruelties until the ministry\r\nwhich came into power in Spain, after the military movement of 1820,\r\nset the few survivors at liberty.\r\n\r\nIt is now confidently asserted that the author of this pamphlet was\r\nan impostor. He came to Buenos Ayres in 1822, and the republican\r\ngovernment granted him a house, and a pension for life of 30 dollars a\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\n[262] The words of the Cura of Belem, who heard it.\r\n\r\n[263] Don Luis Ocampo related this anecdote to Gen. Miller in 1835,\r\nwhen he was still living at Cuzco, but upwards of eighty years of age.\r\nAfter Peru had become independent, in about 1828, a person, calling\r\nhimself Fernando Tupac Amaru, appeared in Buenos Ayres, and went on to\r\nLima, becoming a monk in the convent of San Pedro; but he is believed\r\nto have been an impostor.\r\n\r\n[264] Goyeneche was created Count of Huaqui. His brother, the late\r\nBishop of Arequipa, and present Archbishop of Lima, is probably the\r\nsenior Bishop of Christendom, dating his appointment from 1809; and he\r\nis certainly the richest man in all South America.\r\n\r\n[265] _Confesion de Pumacagua._\r\n\r\n[266] Information from Gen.

His\r\nfather was afterwards shot in the plaza of Puno, by the Spaniards, and\r\nwhen the liberating army arrived on the coast of Peru, in 1822, the\r\nyoung San Roman hurried down from his mountain home to join their ranks.\r\n\r\n[276] In October, 1823, Gen. Miller saw the fair object of the\r\npoet Melgar's adoration, at Camana, on the coast of Peru. She was\r\na native of Arequipa, with light hair, blue eyes, and a fair clear\r\ncomplexion. She refused Melgar, married another, and, being obliged\r\nto flee with her husband to escape the persecution of the Royalists,\r\nfound an asylum on the banks of the river Camana. Her maiden name was\r\nParedes.--Miller's _Memoirs_, ii. p. 90.\r\n\r\nMelgar's brother is now Minister of Foreign Affairs at Lima.\r\n\r\n[277] Information from Don Luis Quiñones of Azangaro.\r\n\r\n[278] So strong is the feeling of the Peruvian people generally against\r\nthis oppressive system, that, in the reformed constitution promulgated\r\non Nov. 25, 1860, forced recruiting was declared to be a crime.\r\n\r\n\"El reclutamiento es un crimen.\"--_Titulo_ xvi., _art._ 123.\r\n\r\n[279] In 1859 there was a very formidable rising of the Indians in\r\nChayanta, which was not put down until after much bloodshed.\r\n\r\n[280] Humboldt.\r\n\r\n[281] Hatun-colla was once the capital of the great Inca province of\r\nthe Collao.\r\n\r\n[282] The three latter are also mentioned by Haenke.\r\n\r\n[283] _Antiquedades Peruanas._\r\n\r\n[284] One of the manufacturers, Don Manuel Zenon Ramos, has been very\r\nactive in seeking for instruction, designs, and models from Europe.\r\n\r\n[285] _Lupinus Paniculatus._--Chloris Andina, ii. p. 252.\r\n\r\n[286] Landa sent in a report of his expedition to the Corregidor of\r\nCuzco.

Garcilasso de la Vega, the\r\nhistorian of the Incas, thus describes the use made by them of the\r\ndeposits of guano on the coast of Peru:--\r\n\r\n\"On the shores of the sea, from below Arequipa to Tarapaca, which is\r\nmore than 200 leagues of coast, they use no other manure than that of\r\nsea-birds, which abound in all the coasts of Peru, and go in such great\r\nflocks that it would be incredible to one who had not seen them. They\r\nbreed on certain uninhabited islands which are on that coast; and the\r\nmanure which they deposit is in such quantities that it would also seem\r\nincredible. From afar the heaps of manure appear like the peaks of some\r\nsnowy mountain range. In the time of the kings, who were Incas, such\r\ncare was taken to guard these birds in the breeding season, that it was\r\nnot lawful for any one to land on the isles, on pain of death, that the\r\nbirds might not be frightened, nor driven from their nests. Neither was\r\nit lawful to kill them at any time, either on the islands or elsewhere,\r\nalso on pain of death. Each island was, by order of the Incas, set\r\napart for the use of a particular province, and the guano was fairly\r\ndivided, each village receiving a due portion. Now in these times it\r\nis wasted after a different fashion. There is much fertility in this\r\nbird-manure.\"--II. lib. v. cap. iii. p. 134-5. (Madrid, 1723.)\r\n\r\nFrezier mentions that, when he was on the coast in 1713, guano was\r\nbrought from Iquique and other ports along the coast, and landed at\r\nArica and Ylo, for the aji-pepper and other crops.--Frezier's _South\r\nSea_, p. 152.

In Jibleea the guano is found coating nearly\r\nthe whole of the island (about 500,000 tons), white and polished, so as\r\nto be very slippery, which is very different from the guano of Peru. In\r\nMay, 1857, this guano from Jibleea island was analyzed at Bombay by Dr.\r\nGiraud, with the following result:--\r\n\r\n  Water                                      6·88\r\n  Azotized matter, with ammoniacal salts    38·75\r\n  Fixed alkaline salts                       6·\r\n  Sand                                      26·25\r\n  Sulphate of lime                           3·77\r\n  Phosphate of lime                         18·35\r\n                                           ------\r\n                                           100·00\r\n                                           ------\r\n\r\nThus the quantity of phosphate of lime is very small, and it appears\r\nthat the rains have washed it down, and that it has formed a\r\nstalactitic deposit on the surface of the rock beneath the guano. A\r\ncargo of this deposit was shipped and sold at Liverpool for 8_l._ a ton.\r\n\r\nThe composition of Peruvian guano is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Water                                  13·73\r\n  Organic matter and ammoniacal salts    53·16\r\n  Phosphates                             23·48\r\n  Alkaline salts                          7·97\r\n  Sand                                    1·66\r\n                                        ------\r\n                                        100.00\r\n                                        ------\r\n\r\nOf Ichaboe guano:--\r\n\r\n  Water                                   24·21\r\n  Organic matter, and ammoniacal salts    39·30\r\n  Phosphates                              30·00\r\n  Alkaline salts                           4·19\r\n  Sand                                     2·30\r\n                                         ------\r\n                                         100·00\r\n                                         ------\r\n\r\n[364] The Peruvian Government contracted three loans in London between\r\n1822 and 1825, amounting to 1,816,000_l._, bearing interest at 6 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nNo interest was paid from 1825 to 1849, when the sales of guano had\r\ngreatly increased the resources of Peru. In 1849 Señor Osma made an\r\nagreement with the bondholders to issue New Bonds at 4 per cent. per\r\nannum, the rate to increase 1/2 per cent. annually up to 6 per cent.\r\nArrears of interest, about 2,615,000_l._, were to be capitalized, and\r\nDeferred Bonds to be issued to represent 75 per cent. of these arrears,\r\nand to bear interest at 1 per cent. per annum, increasing 1/2 per cent.\r\nannually up to 3 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn 1852 the Congress authorised General Mendiburu to effect a loan in\r\nLondon for 2,600,000_l._ to redeem the remainder of the 6 per cent.\r\nloan, and to refund other home and Chile debts.\r\n\r\nThe annual interest and sinking fund amount, respectively, to\r\n267,000_l._ and 82,000_l._; the payment of which is secured on the\r\nprofits of guano sold in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThere is also a French loan of 800,000_l._ secured on the profits of\r\nguano sold in France.\r\n\r\nThe whole foreign debt of Peru amounted to 4,491,042_l._ in 1857; and\r\nthe domestic debt to 4,835,708_l._ The foreign debt is annually reduced\r\nby means of a sinking fund.\r\n\r\n[365] _Memorias de los Vireyes que han gobernado el Peru._ (Lima, 1859.)\r\n\r\n[366] After his death 22 wounds were found on his body, and 2 bullets\r\nlodged.\r\n\r\n[367] Mr. Howard has recently obtained 8·5 per cent. of alkaloids from\r\na specimen of red bark.\r\n\r\n[368] There is no ascertained law by which many of the species of the\r\nchinchona genus are thus limited to narrow zones as regards latitude.\r\nMr. Spruce mentions that on the lower regions of the Andes of Pasto\r\nand Popayan, in New Granada, there are the conditions of climate and\r\naltitude requisite for the growth of _C. succirubra_, but it has not\r\nbeen found there.\r\n\r\n[369] This is not the same as the _pata de gallinazo_ of Huanuco, which\r\nhas been named by Mr. Howard _C. Peruviana_.\r\n\r\n[370] Mr. Cross sowed eight of the seeds; one began to germinate on\r\nthe fourth day, and at the end of a fortnight four seeds had pushed\r\ntheir radicles. In three weeks one had the seed-leaves completely\r\ndeveloped; and on the twenty-eighth day after sowing, the last of\r\nthe eight pushed its radicle. Eight chinchona-seeds, gathered by Mr.\r\nSpruce in 1859, were sown at Guayaquil, which had remained nine months\r\nin his herbarium. Of these four germinated, which clearly shows that\r\nwell-ripened and properly-dried seeds do not lose their vitality for\r\na much longer period than their excessive delicacy would lead one to\r\nsuspect.\r\n\r\n[371] 1. _Notes of a visit to the Chinchona Forests_, by R.

He brought home specimens from the trees whence the seeds\r\nwere obtained, which have been examined by Mr. Howard, and proved to\r\nbelong to _C. nitida_, _C. micrantha_, and _C. Peruviana_.

Very characteristic specimens of the bark, leaves, flowers, and\r\ncapsules of _C. Condaminea_ (_C. Chahuarguera_, Pavon). This kind\r\nyields the rusty crown bark of commerce.\r\n\r\n2. Bark, leaves, and flowers of _C. crispa_, Tafalla, a kind which is\r\nincluded in the _C. Condaminea_, H. and B. It yields the _quina fina de\r\nLoxa_, or _cascarilla crespilla_.\r\n\r\n3. Bark and leaves of _C. Lucumæfolia_ of Pavon, from Zamora. This\r\nis the _cascarilla de hoja de lucma_ of the natives. Mr. Cross made\r\nno attempt to collect the seeds, as this species is comparatively\r\nworthless.\r\n\r\n[384] My collection of dried specimens is deposited in the museum and\r\nherbarium at Kew. It consists of leaves, flowers, fruit, and bark of\r\n_C. Calisaya_; leaves and flowers of _C. micrantha_; leaves and fruit\r\nof _C. Caravayensis_; fruit of _Pimentelia glomerata_; and bark from\r\nthe branches of almost every species of chinchona and allied genera in\r\nthe Caravayan forests.\r\n\r\nMr. Spruce's collection of all the parts of _C. succirubra_ is in the\r\nherbarium at Kew.\r\n\r\nMr. Pritchett's collection of leaves, fruit, and bark of _C. nitida_,\r\n_C. micrantha_, _C.

Lucumæfolia_, are\r\npartly in my possession, partly in that of Mr. Howard, and partly in\r\nthat of Mr. Veitch.\r\n\r\n[385] Six cases of chinchona-plants from this depôt were despatched to\r\nCeylon by the mail of March 4, 1862.\r\n\r\n[386] See Fortune's _Tea Districts_, chap. xxi. p. 358-9.\r\n\r\n[387] Mr. Cross says that Wardian cases, as they are at present\r\nconstructed, are notoriously unfit for the growth of plants of any\r\ndescription. He adds that the plants must be healthy root and top\r\nbefore they are deposited in the cases. They ought to be exposed for at\r\nleast a month to the full action of the sun and atmosphere, so that the\r\njuices, stems, and leaves may be fully developed and matured. Plants\r\ntaken out of hothouses, or from dense forests, are not in a fit state\r\nto be sent away immediately in Wardian cases. They are then \"blanched,\"\r\nand are easily affected by adverse influences, such as excess of\r\nmoisture or drought.\r\n\r\n[388] In October, 1861, the _Schinus molle_ plants were 3 feet high;\r\nand the chirimoyas 15 inches. Plants of both have been sent to the\r\ngardens at Bangalore.\r\n\r\n[389] Seemann's _Voyage of the Herald_, i. p. 171.\r\n\r\n[390] These 11 classes are:--1. The _Kirüm Nairs_, who are\r\nagriculturists, clerks, and accountants, and do the cooking on all\r\npublic occasions, a sure sign of transcendent rank. 2. The _Sudra\r\nNairs_. 3. The _Charnadus_. 4. The _Villiums_, who are palkee-bearers\r\nto Namburis and Rajahs. 5. The _Wattacotas_, or oil-makers. 6. The\r\n_Atticourchis_, or cultivators. 7.

At the commencement of the monsoon beds of 10 or 12 feet by 3\r\nor 4 are formed, in which holes are dug a foot apart, which are filled\r\nwith manure. The roots, hitherto carefully buried under sheds, are dug\r\nout, chipped into suitable sizes for planting (1-1/2 to 2 inches long),\r\nand buried in the holes. The bed is then covered with a thick layer\r\nof green leaves, which serve as manure, while they keep the beds from\r\ntoo much dampness. Rain is requisite, but the beds must be kept from\r\ninundation, and drains are therefore cut between them. The roots or\r\nrhizomes, when old, are scalded, scraped, and dried, and thus form the\r\nwhite ginger of commerce.--Drury's _Useful Plants of India_.\r\n\r\n[397] The tallipot or fan-palm (_Corypha umbraculifera_) has a stem 60\r\nor 70 feet high, crowned with enormous fan-shaped leaves, with 40 or 50\r\npairs of segments. These fronds, when dried, are very strong, and are\r\nused for hats and umbrellas. The petiole is seven feet long, and the\r\nblade six feet long and thirteen feet broad.\r\n\r\n[398] The sumach-tree (_Cæsalpinia coriaria_) was introduced into India\r\nfrom America, by Dr. Wallich, in 1842.

The bark yields a fine strong fibre, which the\r\nnatives obtain by first boiling the whole plant, to deprive it\r\nof its virulently-stinging properties, and then peeling the\r\nstalks. The textile material thus obtained is of great delicacy\r\nand strength.--Wight's _Spicelegium Neilgherense_. The fibre of\r\nthe Neilgherry nettle is worth 200_l._ a ton in England, and its\r\ncultivation is likely to be a remunerative speculation.\r\n\r\n[404] _Tribes inhabiting the Neilgherry Hills, from the rough Notes of\r\na German Missionary._ (Madras, 1856.)\r\n\r\n[405] _Vocabulary of the Dialect spoken by the Todars of the Nilagiri\r\nMountains_, by the Rev.

Tamil\r\nliterature, now extant, dates from the eighth or ninth century: p. 68.\r\n\r\n[448] Dr. Ainslie, in his _Materia Medica_, gives a list of twenty\r\nworks by Aghastya, chiefly on medical subjects, some of them translated\r\nfrom Sanscrit.\r\n\r\n[449] For a list of kings of Madura, of the Pandyan and Naik dynasties,\r\nsee a paper in the Asiatic Society's Journals, by H. H. Wilson; from\r\nMS. collections of the late Colonel Mackenzie.\r\n\r\n[450] Tanjore was seized by the Mahrattas in 1675. The last Naik\r\nsovereign of Madura was installed as a tributary of the Nawab of the\r\nCarnatic.\r\n\r\n[451] Namely the _Michelia Champacca_, a golden-coloured flower\r\nwith a strong aromatic smell, also dedicated to Krishna; the\r\nmango-flower-called _amra_; the _Pavonia odorata_ with a sweet flower,\r\ncalled _bulla_; the _Strychnos potatorum_; and the _Mesua ferea_, a\r\nguttiferous plant, with a flower white outside, and yellow inside the\r\ntube, with a smell like sweet-briar.\r\n\r\n[452] While on the subject of sacred Hindu plants, I may also\r\nmention the _soma_ juice, so often alluded to in the Vedas, which\r\ncomes from a leafless asclepiad (_Sarcostemma viminale_) with white\r\nflowers in terminal umbels, which appear during the rains, in the\r\nDeccan: the holy _kusa_-grass (_Poa cynosuroides_), made into ropes\r\nin the N.W. provinces: the peepul-tree, the banyan, the neem (_Melia\r\nAzadyraclita_): the _Cratæva religiosa_, specially sacred to Siva:\r\nthe _Nerium odorum_, sacred to Vishnu and Siva: the _Cæsalpinia\r\npulcherrima_, sacred to Siva: the _Guettarda speciosa_, sacred to\r\nSiva and Vishnu: the _Origanum marjoranum_, a labiate plant sacred\r\nto Vishnu and Siva: the _Caryophyllum inophyllum_, sacred to Vishnu\r\nand Siva: the _Pandanus odoratissimus_, sacred to Vishnu and Mariama,\r\nbut offensive to Siva: the _Artemisia astriaka_, sacred to Vishnu and\r\nSiva: the _Ocimum sanctum_ or _toolsu_, a labiate plant with a white\r\nflower, specially sacred to Vishnu and Krishna: and the _Chrisanthemum\r\nIndicum_, a yellow flower, sacred to Vishnu and Siva.\r\n\r\n[453] Mr. Caldwell considers that these lines do not allude to any of\r\nthe avaturs of the Hindu Deities, but that they are borrowed, in some\r\nunexplained way, from Christianity.\r\n\r\n[454] In Fergusson's _Architecture_, i. p. 105, the hall is represented\r\nwith an arched roof, in a sketch from Daniell's _Views of Hindostan_.\r\n\r\n[455] There was a Portuguese Jesuit mission, with two Christian\r\nchurches, established at Madura during the reign of Tirumalla Naik. It\r\nwas founded by Robert de Nobilibus, a nephew of Cardinal Bellarmin, and\r\nthe missionaries wore the sacred thread, declaring themselves to be\r\nBrahmins from the West.\r\n\r\n[456] The Brahmins of course are of mixed blood, through intercourse\r\nwith Tamil women. Children are therefore Sudras, and are not Brahmins\r\nuntil they are invested with the sacred thread.\r\n\r\n[457] From _Parei_, a drum, as they act as drummers at funerals.\r\n\r\n[458] Caldwell's _Comparative Dravidian Grammar_, Appendix, p. 491.\r\n\r\n[459] _Proceedings of the South India Missionary Conference_, 1858, p.\r\n283.\r\n\r\n[460] _Reports connected with the duties of the Corps of Engineers of\r\nthe Madras Presidency_, 1846, vol. ii., p. 108. _Report of Captain\r\nBell_, p. 117.\r\n\r\n[461] There was formerly a peculiar system of collecting land revenue\r\nprevalent in Tanjore and part of Tinnevelly, called _Oolungoo_, by\r\nwhich the Government demand was dependent on the current price of\r\ngrain. A standard grain assessment was fixed on each village, and\r\nalso a standard rate according to which the grain demand was to\r\nbe commuted into money; but if prices rose more than 10 per cent.\r\nabove the standard commutation rate, or fell more than 5 per cent.\r\nbelow it, the Government, and not the cultivator, was to receive the\r\nprofit and to bear the loss. The advantage of the system was that\r\nthe Government participated in the benefit of high prices with the\r\ncultivator, while the latter was relieved from loss when prices were\r\nmuch depressed.--Mill's _India in 1858_, p. 119.\r\n\r\nThis Oolungoo system was introduced into Tanjore in 1825. It was\r\nfound that the system was fertile in fraud and corruption, especially\r\nin connection with the determination of the annual price, and\r\nwith claims for alleged deficiency of produce. In July, 1859, the\r\nGovernment resolved to abolish the Oolungoo system, and to substitute\r\na fixed money demand, similar to that which prevails in all other\r\ndistricts. By 1860 this change had been completed, both in Tanjore\r\nand Tinnevelly.--_Principal Measures of Sir Charles Trevelyan's\r\nAdministration at Madras_ (_Madras_, 1860), p. 55.\r\n\r\n[462] The largest temple in Southern India, next to that of Madura.\r\n\r\n[463] From _Kar_, black, and _ur_ a town, in Tamil.\r\n\r\n[464] Hooker's _Flora Indica_, i. p. 124.\r\n\r\n[465] Ibid., i. p. 133.\r\n\r\n[466] Dr. Cleghorn states that the Seegoor forest has been much\r\nexhausted by unscrupulous contractors. \"It is important,\" he adds,\r\n\"that it should be allowed to recover, as it is the main source of\r\nsupply to Ootacamund for housebuilding purposes.\" Captain Morgan has\r\nbeen placed in charge of it, and it is hoped that the sale of sandal\r\nand jungle-wood will cover the expenses, while the young teak is coming\r\non for future supply, P. 36.\r\n\r\n[467] The areca-palm requires a low moist situation, with rather\r\na sandy soil, either under the _bund_ of a tank, or in a position\r\notherwise favourable for irrigation. The seeds are put into holes six\r\nfeet apart, and the tree comes into bearing in about eight years. It\r\nyields fruit for fifty years, and, when in full bearing, produces 1-1/2\r\nlbs. of nuts.\r\n\r\n[468] The Lingayets are members of the _Vira Saiva_ sect, or\r\nworshippers of Siva as the _Linga_, a representation of which they\r\ncarry round their necks. The sect is numerous in the central and\r\nsouthern parts of the peninsula. It is of modern origin, having been\r\nfounded by a Brahmin of Kalyan in the middle of the 12th century.\r\nIts members deny the sanctity of the Brahmins and the authority of\r\nthe Vedas, recognize various divinities, and virtually abolish the\r\ndistinction of castes and the inferiority of women. They are divided\r\ninto _Aradhyas_, by birth Brahmins, and often well versed in Sanscrit\r\nliterature; _Jangamas_, who have a literature of their own, written in\r\nKarnata and Telugu; and Bhaktas.--Wilson's _Indian Glossary_, p. 311.\r\n\r\n[469] The whole population of Coorg is about 119,160.\r\n\r\n[470] Namely, the _Amma Kodagas_ or Cauvery Brahmins; the _Kodagas_ or\r\nchief tribe; the _Himbokulu_ or herdsmen; the _Heggade_ or cultivators;\r\nthe _Ari_ or carpenters; the _Badige_ or smiths; the _Kuruba_ or honey\r\ngatherers; the _Kavati_ or jungle cultivators; the _Budiya_ or drawers\r\nof toddy from the _Caryota urens_ palm; the _Meda_ or basket-makers;\r\nthe _Kaleya_ or farm-labourers; the _Holeya_ or slaves; and the\r\n_Yerawa_ or slaves from Malabar, cheaper than cattle.\r\n\r\n[471] _Coorg_, by Rev.

The land is less than a mile wide, the rest being a reef\r\nencircling a large lagoon. Within a hundred yards of the reef there\r\nis no bottom. The lagoon, which abounds in turtle and fish, has three\r\nentrances from the sea, one of which has a depth of two fathoms. The\r\nsoil of the island is a coarse powdered coral, with a little vegetable\r\nmatter. It is quite flat, no part being destitute of vegetation; the\r\nsouth thickly covered with cocoanut-trees and underwood, and the north\r\nmore sparingly. Rats abound, there are some cats, a few cows and goats,\r\nlarge grey cranes, ducks occasionally, and the mosquitos are fearful.\r\n\r\nThe population is 2500; of these 116 are _Malikans_, the aristocracy\r\nof the islands, who own vessels trading to Bengal. The _Koornakar_, or\r\nagent of the Beebee, is generally a _Malikan_; he collects rents, and\r\nsuperintends her traffic. The _Malikans_ have the exclusive privilege\r\nof wearing shoes, live in large houses built round courtyards, and\r\npossess English quadrants, charts, compasses, and telescopes. Below\r\nthem are 180 _Malummies_, or pilots, a rank obtained by merit.\r\nThen 1107 _Klasies_, forming the bulk of the population, who are\r\nsmall landed proprietors, go to sea for regular wages, but are very\r\nindependent. Then 583 _Maylacherries_, or tree-climbers for hire. The\r\nhead-men are elected by the people. The islanders have six or seven\r\nvessels fit for the Bengal trade, and three or four for coasting. They\r\ngo with money to Goa and Mangalore for salt and rice, with coir to\r\nBengal, with cocoanuts to Galle, and bring Calcutta cloths home.--Mr.\r\nThomas's _Report_.\r\n\r\n[480] The gross exports of cotton from the ports in the various\r\ndistricts of the Madras Presidency in 1859-60 were as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Vizagapatam              40,758 lbs.

The tender leaves and\r\nlegumes of the _agati_ (_Agati grandiflora_); oil from the _elloopa_\r\nfruit (_Bassia longifolia_); young unripe gourds of the _Benincasa\r\ncerifera_; the _papaw_ fruit; cocoanut-oil; the leaves of _Canthium\r\nparviflorum_; capsicums; cinnamon; leaves of _Cocculus villosus_;\r\nturmeric; cardamoms; _jhingo_ (_Luffa acutangula_); the fruit of\r\n_Momordica charantia_; green fruit of _Morinda citrifolia_; the legumes\r\nof the horse-radish-tree (_Hyperanthera Moringa_); the plantain; the\r\ntender shoots of the lotus; the pickled seeds of a _Nymphæa_; the\r\nleaves of _Premna latifolia_; berries of _Solanum verbascifolium_;\r\nlegumes of _Trigonella tetrapetala_; the white centre of the leaf culms\r\nof lemon-grass; the _Lablab cultratus_; onions; the fruit of _Sapota\r\nelingoides_ in the Neilgherries; the _moong_ (_Phaseolus mungo_); and\r\nmany other pulses.\r\n\r\n[495] The ploughs, and the carts on wheels bringing home the food from\r\nthe fields, are mentioned in the 1st Ashtaka of the Rig Veda.\r\n\r\n[496] Dr. Forbes Watson has made some very interesting calculations on\r\nthe amount of pulses rich in nitrogen, which must be added to rice and\r\nother cereals comparatively poor in that constituent, in order that the\r\nmixture may contain the same proportion of carbonous to nitrogenous\r\nmatter as is found in wheat, namely six to one. (See Table, next page.)\r\n\r\nThe cereals which I saw growing in the peninsula of India, besides\r\nrice, maize, wheat, and barley, were:--\r\n\r\n1. _Setaria Italica_, called _tennay_ in Tamil, and _samee_ by the\r\ntribes on the Neilgherry hills, which is the Italian millet. The seeds\r\nare used for cakes and porridge. In the Deccan it is only cultivated\r\nin small quantities for the ryot's own use, and seldom for market. The\r\ngrain is very small.\r\n\r\n2. _Panicum Miliaceum_, called _varagoo_ on the Pulney hills, and\r\n_warree_ in the Deccan: a small millet, generally sown broadcast on the\r\nsides of hills. In the Neilgherries it is used as an offering to the\r\ngods, mixed with honey, and wrapped in plantain-leaves.\r\n\r\n3. _Panicum pilosum_, or _badlee_, will grow in the worst soil, but is\r\nnot much cultivated, unless the rains happen to be too scanty for other\r\ncrops. The seed is very small, forming a long hairy spike.\r\n\r\n4. _Cynosurus corocanus_, or _ragee_, is a very prolific grain, and\r\nforms the staple food of the poorer classes in Mysore, and on the\r\nslopes of the ghauts. It requires a light good soil, from which the\r\nwater readily flows. In the Deccan they raise it in seed-beds, and\r\ntransplant when a few inches high. It is made into dark brown cakes.\r\n\r\n5. _Holcus spicatus_, or spiked millet, called _cumboo_ in Madras, and\r\n_bajree_ in the Deccan, where it is the chief food of the inhabitants,\r\nand is considered very nutritious.\r\n\r\n6. _Sorghum vulgare_, or great millet, called _cholum_ in Madras, and\r\n_jowaree_ in the Deccan. It is made into cakes and porridge, and the\r\nstalks, which contain sugar, are excellent fodder for cattle. It grows\r\nsix or eight feet high, and soon exhausts the soil, so that two crops\r\nare never taken in succession.\r\n\r\n7. _Sesamum Indicum_, or gingelee oil-plant, called _till_ in the\r\nDeccan. Oil is expressed from the seeds, which are also toasted and\r\nground into meal for food. In the Deccan it is sown on gravelly or red\r\nsoil, and the plants grow three or four feet high. Presents of the\r\nseed, made up in little boxes, are exchanged by friends on the day that\r\nthe sun takes its northerly declination; and they are also acceptable\r\nas offerings to the god Mahadeo or Siva.\r\n\r\nWith these seven grains, the following pulses are usually raised:--\r\n\r\n1. _Cicer arietinum_, or Bengal gram, the seeds of which are eaten, and\r\nthe oxalic acid, which exudes from all parts of the plant, is used as\r\nvinegar for curries.\r\n\r\n2. _Dolichos unifloris_, or horse gram, with grey seeds, used for\r\nfeeding horses and cattle.\r\n\r\n3. _Dolichos sinensis_, or _lobia_, a twining annual, with large pale\r\nviolet flowers. The seeds are much used for food.\r\n\r\n4. _Cajanus Indicus_, pigeon-pea, or _toor_. A shrub three to six feet\r\nhigh, with yellow papilionaceous flowers. This is an excellent pulse,\r\nand makes a good peas-pudding.\r\n\r\n5. _Phaseolus mungo_, black gram, or _moong_. A nearly erect, hairy\r\nannual, with greenish-yellow flowers. It is much cultivated, and is a\r\nvery important article of food.\r\n\r\n6. _Phaseolus rostratus_, or _hullounda_, a twining plant, with large,\r\ndeep rose-purple, papilionaceous flowers, grown in Malabar, and other\r\nparts of the peninsula.\r\n\r\n7. Another kind of _moong_, called _ooreed_, with black and white seeds.\r\n\r\n8. _Lablab cultratus_, a twining plant, with white, red, or purple\r\npapilionaceous flowers; much cultivated in gardens, and used for food.\r\n\r\n9. _Dolichos lablab_, or _bulla_, a twining plant of which there are\r\nseveral varieties. The seeds are much eaten by the poorer classes when\r\nrice is dear, and are reckoned a wholesome substantial food. Cattle are\r\nvery fond of the stalks. One variety, with white flowers, is cultivated\r\nin gardens, supported on poles, forming arbours about the doors of\r\nhouses. The pods are eaten, but not the seeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cereals.]\r\n\r\n[497] Built in 1749 by the Peishwa Balajee Bajee Rao.\r\n\r\n[498] \"The cultivation of the chinchona-trees may succeed in localities\r\nnot appearing to offer exactly the same conditions regarding climate\r\nand the general character of the country as are peculiar to their\r\nnative forests.\"--_Report by Dr. Brandis_ (Supplement to the _Calcutta\r\nGazette_, August 31, 1861), p. 467.\r\n\r\n[499] \"Mr. McIvor deserves great credit for the manner in which he\r\nhas laid out the garden.

Condaminea seeds in a letter, which\r\narrived first at Ootacamund, in the middle of February. Sixteen days\r\nafter sowing, twelve seeds were found to have germinated; and early in\r\nMarch 138 seedlings were up, or 30 per cent. of the total number of\r\nseeds sown. The large parcel of seeds arrived at Ootacamund on March\r\n4th, and were sown at once. See p. 570.\r\n\r\n[506] This is a variety of _C. nitida_.\r\n\r\n[507] The chinchona-plantations were commenced in Java in December\r\n1854. On the 31st of December, 1860, they had of\r\n\r\n  _C. Calisaya_ plants:  5510 in the germinating sheds.\r\n                         1806 planted out.\r\n                         1030 living cuttings.\r\n  _C. lancifolia_ plants:  38 in the nursery sheds.\r\n                           42 planted out.\r\n                           28 living cuttings.\r\n                         ----\r\n            Total        8454\r\n\r\nTheir other species is worthless.--Mr. Fraser's _Report_, p. 2.\r\n\r\n[508] \"It is the height of improvidence for the collectors to strip\r\noff the bark from the roots, thus securing a worthless product at the\r\nexpense of any possible future renovation of the tree.\"--_Howard_.\r\n\r\n[509] See chap. iii. p. 58.\r\n\r\n[510] This is provided for in Java by placing a shed over the young\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n[511] Mr. McIvor informs me that the winter of 1861-62 was the coldest\r\nhe has experienced since he came to the Neilgherry hills, a period of\r\nfourteen years.\r\n\r\n[512] Spruce's _Report_, p. 23.\r\n\r\n[513] Howard, _Nueva Quinologia_, Nos. 2 and 7.\r\n\r\n[514] Cross's _Report_, p. 5.\r\n\r\n[515] See also Weddell's _Histoire Naturelle des Quinquinas_, p. 32.\r\n\r\n[516] Mr. Howard thinks that the alkaloids are formed in the barks,\r\nby a reaction between ammonia and chincho-tannic acid. The alkaloids\r\nare pure in the bark of the branches, somewhat less so in that of\r\nthe trunk, and most impure in that of the roots.--_Microscopic\r\nObservations_, p. 2.\r\n\r\n[517] Howard.\r\n\r\n[518] Spruce's _Report_, p. 83.\r\n\r\n[519] Ibid., p. 27. See also _Karsten_, p. 20.\r\n\r\n[520] _Karsten_, p. 20.\r\n\r\n[521] Spruce's _Report_, p. 23.\r\n\r\n[522] Lindley's _Theory and Practice of Horticulture_, p. 70.\r\n\r\n[523] In quills from large branches there is more alkaloid than in the\r\nsmaller branches: in the bark of the trunk the proportion is still\r\nfurther increased, but this diminishes in quantity and deteriorates in\r\nquality in the bark of the roots.--_Howard._\r\n\r\n[524] Mr. McIvor reports the thickness of the bark of some of the young\r\nplants at Ootacamund to be nearly a quarter of an inch. The bark of\r\nquills of _C. Calisaya_ given me by Mr. Howard, as samples from a lot\r\non sale, is only one-eighth of an inch in thickness.\r\n\r\n[525] The only reason why the value of quill-bark is much less than\r\nthat of _tabla_-bark is that the former is usually mixed with spurious\r\nbarks. Otherwise the value of quill-bark would only be about threepence\r\nper lb. less than _tabla_-bark.\r\n\r\n[526] Cinnamon is one of the plants which, like the chinchonæ, are\r\ncultivated solely for their bark. Mr. Thwaites, the Director of the\r\nBotanical Gardens in Ceylon, has supplied me with a few particulars\r\nrespecting the cultivation of cinnamon. The young shoots are peeled\r\ntwice during the year, at a particular period of growth, when the bark\r\ncomes off readily. This time is known at once by the peelers, from the\r\nappearance of the young shoots, and the process of peeling is then a\r\nvery expeditious one, with practised hands. Young plants are raised\r\nfrom seeds in nurseries, and planted six feet apart, when they are a\r\nfoot or eighteen inches long. They will commonly bear peeling in three\r\nor four years after being transplanted, if in a favourable locality\r\nand properly attended to. The roots are earthed up frequently, to keep\r\nthe soil loose and free from weeds. In 1858, 750,744 lbs. of cinnamon\r\nwere exported from Ceylon, worth 37,537_l._ There are forty-nine\r\ncinnamon-gardens in the island.\r\n\r\n[527] Mr. McIvor observes that the leaves of all the chinchona-plants\r\nat Ootacamund are exceedingly bitter to the taste, and he suggests that\r\nthese leaves, which naturally fall off the trees in succession, may\r\nbe turned to account by being imported to England as a substitute for\r\nhops in the manufacture of beer. They would no doubt prove a healthy\r\ningredient in beer, but it remains to be proved whether their bitter\r\nwould preserve it as well as hops.\r\n\r\n[528] \"Attacked with violent tertian ague, and without any medicine,\r\nin Pampa-yacu, I made use of the green bark direct from the\r\nchinchona-tree, which I peeled from one growing a few hundred steps\r\ndistant; and although, in consequence of unavoidable exposure in the\r\nrainy season, and the very great exhaustion after eight months' wild\r\nforest life, the disease returned on three occasions, it was each time\r\nconquered within a week. The very unpleasant additional effect, in this\r\ncase, of the green bark, of producing obstinate obstructions, demands\r\nconsideration. It might be well obviated by a plentiful addition of\r\nEpsom salts to the infusion. After the first dose of this fresh and\r\nunadulterated remedy, a sensation of general well-being is felt, and\r\nafter recovery, on the first excursion, one approaches the healing\r\ntrees with warm feelings of gratitude, whose beautiful reddish blossoms\r\nappear in such quantities in January, and their round crowns can be\r\ndistinguished at a distance.\"--Poeppig, _Reise_, ii. p. 223.\r\n\r\n[529] _Histoire Naturelle des Quinquinas_, p. 13.\r\n\r\n[530] \"From the unfitness of the 'Grey Bark' species for the production\r\nof quinine, comparatively small good will be likely to result from\r\ntheir naturalisation.\"--Howard, _Introduction_, p. xiii.\r\n\r\n[531] _Quinine and Antiperiodics in their Therapeutic Relations_, by\r\nDr. J.
