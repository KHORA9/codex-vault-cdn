The period of limited offensives, bypassing, and island hopping\r\nwas virtually over. American troops in greater numbers than ever\r\nbefore assembled in the Pacific Theater, supported by naval and air\r\nforces of corresponding size, fought and overcame Japanese forces of\r\ngreater magnitude than any previously met.\r\n\r\nThough the spotlight is on the front-line fighting, the reader will\r\nfind in this volume a faithful description of all arms and services\r\nperforming their missions. The account is not exclusively an infantry\r\nstory. It covers as well the support of ground fighting on Leyte by\r\nlarge-scale naval operations and by land-based air power under the\r\nmost adverse conditions. In addition, careful attention to logistical\r\nmatters, such as the movement of supplies and the evacuation of the\r\nwounded, gives the reader a picture of the less spectacular activities\r\nof an army in battle.\r\n\r\n\r\nORLANDO WARD\r\nMaj. Gen., U. S. A.\r\nChief of Military History\r\n\r\nWashington, D. C.\r\n30 January 1953\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Hamlin Cannon received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in History\r\nfrom the American University of Washington, D.C.  He is already\r\nknown to American historians for his writings on Mormon and Civil\r\nWar history which have appeared in historical journals.  During World\r\nWar II he served with the Navy in Australia and New Guinea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe landing of the American forces on Leyte on 20 October 1944 brought\r\nto fruition the long-cherished desire of General Douglas MacArthur to\r\nreturn to the Philippine Islands and avenge the humiliating reverses\r\nsuffered in the early days of World War II. The successful conclusion\r\nof the campaign separated the Japanese-held Philippine Archipelago\r\ninto two parts, with a strong American force between them. More\r\nimportant, it completed the severance of the Japanese mainland from\r\nthe stolen southern empire in the Netherlands Indies from which oil,\r\nthe lifeblood of modern warfare, had come.\r\n\r\nThe Leyte Campaign, like other campaigns in the Pacific, was\r\nwaged on the land, in the air, and on and under the sea. In this\r\noperation all branches of the American armed forces played significant\r\nroles. Therefore, although the emphasis in this volume is placed upon\r\nthe deeds of the United States Army ground soldier, the endeavors\r\nof the aviator, the sailor, the marine and the Filipino guerrilla\r\nhave been integrated as far as possible into the story in order to\r\nmake the campaign understandable in its entirety. At the same time,\r\nevery effort has been made to give the Japanese side of the story.\r\n\r\nObviously, to include every exploit of every branch of the armed\r\nforces, of the Filipinos, and of the Japanese would be far beyond\r\nthe compass of a single volume. A careful selectivity was necessary\r\nthroughout in order to avoid the Scylla of omission while skirting\r\nthe Charybdis of oversimplification. Despite these precautions,\r\nbecause of the nature of the available documentary evidence, I may\r\nhave unwittingly fallen into some of the very pitfalls that I tried\r\nto avoid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI wish to express my sincere gratitude and thanks to the many people\r\nwho have given fully of their time and talents in the preparation of\r\nthis volume.\r\n\r\nEspecial thanks are due to Dr. John Miller, jr., who, during his tenure\r\nas Chief of the Pacific Section, Office of the Chief of Military\r\nHistory, carefully reviewed the final draft of the manuscript. His\r\nsound advice and constructive criticism eliminated many a roadblock. I\r\nwish, also, to thank Dr. Louis Morton, Chief of the Pacific Section,\r\nunder whose direction this volume was started; he made constructive\r\ncriticism of several of the chapters. Dr. Kent Roberts Greenfield,\r\nChief Historian, Department of the Army, devoted much time and effort\r\nto reviewing the manuscript and his many penetrating comments on the\r\nvarious chapters were invaluable.\r\n\r\nAppreciation is due to the people of the Historical Records Section,\r\nDepartmental Records Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, who\r\nhelped to locate source material and furnished working space for me\r\nand the records. To Mrs. Lois Aldridge, Mrs. Frances Bowen, Mrs. Clyde\r\nChristian, Miss Margaret Emerson, Mrs. Ellen Garrison, Mr. Robert\r\nGreathouse, Miss Matilda Huber, Mrs. Margarite Kerstetter, Mr. Wilbur\r\nNigh, Miss Sue D. Wallace, and Miss Thelma K. Yarborough--thanks.\r\n\r\nI wish also to thank the members of the U. S. Air Force Historical\r\nDivision, Air University, and the Naval History Branch, Naval Records\r\nand History Division, Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, for\r\nplacing at my disposal the pertinent air and naval records.\r\n\r\nThanks are also due to the members of the historical sections of the\r\nU. S. Navy and the U. S. Air Force and to the many participating\r\ncommanders of various branches of the U. S. armed forces who read\r\nall or parts of the manuscript.\r\n\r\nThe late W. Brooks Phillips started the editing of the manuscript. He\r\nwas succeeded by Col. B. A. Day, Chief of the Editorial and Publication\r\nDivision, and Mrs. Loretto Stevens. Mrs. Stevens also prepared the\r\nfinal copy for the printer. Miss Mary Ann Bacon prepared the index.\r\n\r\nMrs. Martha Willoughby, in addition to accomplishing the arduous\r\ntask of interpreting my handwriting, typed many of the drafts of the\r\nmanuscript and saw that the subject and predicate agreed. Mrs. Wynona\r\nHayden, Mrs. Stella Hess, and Mrs. Michael Miller also typed parts\r\nof the manuscript. Miss Elizabeth Armstrong painstakingly typed the\r\nfinal copy.\r\n\r\nMr. Wsevolod Aglaimoff and Lt. Col. Robert F. O'Donnell, as well as\r\nother members of the Cartographic Branch, spent many months in research\r\nfor and preparation of the maps. At the time this volume was being\r\nprepared for publication, no reliable maps of Leyte were available. The\r\nmaps for this volume are based on the highly inaccurate maps used by\r\nthe troops during the operation. The relief in particular, as shown\r\non these maps, has little in common with the terrain configuration\r\nwhich confronted the troops. Thus, both military and geographical\r\ninformation as given on the maps in the volume should be regarded only\r\nas an approximation of the actual situation at the time of the battle.\r\n\r\nMajor Arthur T. Lawry selected and edited the photographs used in this\r\nvolume. Lt. Roger Pineau (USNR) furnished me the photograph of General\r\nSuzuki. Mr. Israel Wice and his capable assistants in the General\r\nReference Branch were helpful at crucial stages of the manuscript.\r\n\r\nMy sincere appreciation and thanks go to Maj. Gen. Harry A. Maloney,\r\nChief of Military History, and to his successors, Maj. Gen. Orlando\r\nWard and Maj. Gen. Albert C. Smith, as well as to members of their\r\nstaffs, for their understanding and co-operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. HAMLIN CANNON\r\n\r\nWashington, D.

Col. Theodore M. Cornell, U.S. Army, to Bernardo Torres,\r\nGovernor of Leyte, the control which the United States had held over\r\nthe island since 1898 came to an end. Nearly two and a half years were\r\nto elapse before the sound of naval guns in Leyte Gulf would announce\r\nto the world the opening of the Leyte Campaign, the first phase of\r\nthe re-entry of American forces into the Philippine Archipelago. (Map\r\n1--inside back cover)\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of the Leyte Campaign was to establish an air\r\nand logistical base in the Leyte area in order to support operations\r\nin the Luzon-Formosa-China coast area and particularly to nullify\r\nJapanese strength in Luzon. Leyte is one of the Visayan Islands,\r\nwhich constitute the geographical heart of the Philippines. It was\r\nhoped that the fertile Leyte Valley, broad and flat, could be utilized\r\nfor major airfields and base sites from which large-scale operations\r\ncould be launched against the rest of the Philippines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreliminary Discussion\r\n\r\nBehind the decision to go into Leyte lay a series of strategically\r\nsignificant victories, which had followed a staggering initial\r\nreverse. American prewar plans for the Pacific had originally been\r\nbased on the assumption that only the United States and Japan would\r\nbe at war and that the U.S. Pacific Fleet would be in existence. [3]\r\nBut the destruction of the fleet at Pearl Harbor and the entrance of\r\nGermany and Italy into the war nullified these plans. The strategy of\r\nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff [4] in early 1942, therefore, was concerned\r\nchiefly with trying to limit the rapid advance of the Japanese and\r\nwith keeping the line of communications to Australia open. The Pacific\r\nTheater was divided into command areas--the Southwest Pacific Area,\r\nwith General Douglas MacArthur as Supreme Commander (he referred to\r\nhimself, however, as Commander in Chief), and the Pacific Ocean Area\r\n(which included the Central Pacific), with Admiral Chester W. Nimitz\r\nas Commander in Chief. [5]\r\n\r\nIn 1942 and 1943 the Allied forces had halted the Japanese at Papua\r\nand Guadalcanal and started to push them back. On 8 May 1943 the Joint\r\nChiefs approved a \"Strategic Plan for the Defeat of Japan,\" which\r\nwas endorsed by the Combined Chiefs in December. The objective of the\r\nplan was to secure the unconditional surrender of Japan, an objective\r\nthat might necessitate an invasion of the Japanese home islands. As\r\nsuch an invasion promised to be a \"vast undertaking,\" it would be\r\nnecessary to secure a large supply base from which a great aerial\r\noffensive could be mounted against Japan. According to the original\r\nplan this base was to be located in China, but the Mariana Islands were\r\nafterward substituted for China. The plan called for the acquisition\r\nof successive island bases which could be used as \"steppingstones,\"\r\npreferably those which would shorten the sea route, provide for its\r\nsecurity, and at the same time deny to the Japanese bases from which\r\nthey might interfere with the Allied line of communications. The main\r\neffort was to be through the waters of the Pacific Ocean. Nimitz'\r\noperations were to be conducted west through the Japanese mandated\r\nislands while MacArthur's proceeded northwest along the New Guinea\r\ncoast. The two series of operations were to be mutually supporting. [6]\r\n\r\nAlthough no specific islands were named in the Strategic Plan,\r\nthe Philippine Archipelago, because of its strategic position and\r\nlong possession by the United States, naturally loomed large in the\r\nplanning. The Philippines lie athwart all sea routes south from Japan\r\nto the economically important Netherlands Indies--rich in rubber, tin,\r\noil, and rice. The capture of the Philippines would help to sever this\r\nline of communications and would furnish an excellent staging area\r\nfor attacks against China, Formosa, or Japan. Aside from strategic\r\nconsiderations, the liberation of the Islands was important for\r\nreasons of Far Eastern politics and prestige. [7] The obligation of the\r\nUnited States to the subjugated Filipino people could not be lightly\r\nignored. Furthermore, General MacArthur was imbued with a burning\r\ndetermination to return to the Philippine Islands and avenge the\r\nhumiliating defeats suffered by the American forces in 1941 and 1942.\r\n\r\nBy the spring of 1944 the operations in the Pacific were going\r\nso well that the successes had exceeded even the most optimistic\r\nhopes of any of the planning officers. On 12 March the Joint Chiefs\r\nordered General MacArthur to prepare plans for a return to Mindanao,\r\nsouthernmost island of the Philippines, with a target date of 15\r\nNovember 1944. [8] General MacArthur on 15 June issued a plan for\r\nhis future operations. The entrance into the Philippines was to be\r\naccomplished in two phases. The first would be a preliminary operation\r\non 25 October into the Sarangani Bay area in southern Mindanao in\r\norder to establish land-based air forces to augment the carrier-based\r\nair support for the principal effort. The major effort was to be\r\nan amphibious landing operation with forces mounted from New Guinea\r\nfor the seizure on 15 November of airfields and bases on Leyte. [9]\r\nThe latter was to follow quickly on the heels of the first operation\r\nin order to take full advantage of the surprise tactics.\r\n\r\nLeyte occupies a commanding position in the Philippine Islands. Because\r\nof its central location, its repossession by the United States would\r\nnot only divide the Japanese forces in the Philippines but would also\r\nprovide an excellent anchorage in Leyte Gulf, together with sites\r\nfor bases and airfields from which land-based aircraft could bomb all\r\nparts of the Philippines, the coast of China, and Formosa. To an even\r\ngreater extent than Mindanao, Leyte could be made into an excellent\r\nspringboard from which to launch subsequent operations against the\r\nJapanese in Formosa or in the rest of the Philippines.\r\n\r\nIn his planning, General MacArthur recognized that the Leyte operation,\r\nhis most ambitious to date, would require \"massed carrier-based\r\nair support\" and all of the \"combined amphibious and naval forces\r\navailable at the time.\" [10]\r\n\r\nBy June 1944 General MacArthur's forces had pushed up the New Guinea\r\ncoast to the island of Biak, about nine hundred nautical miles\r\nsoutheast of Davao, Mindanao, while those of Admiral Nimitz were\r\npoised to strike at Saipan some twelve hundred miles northeast of\r\nDavao. In most of their previous campaigns the Americans had struck\r\nwith overwhelming force at weakly held Japanese garrisons. Since\r\nthe tide of war was now so favorable to the Allied cause, the Joint\r\nChiefs thought that the Pacific timetable of pending operations\r\nmight be accelerated. On 13 June they had therefore asked MacArthur\r\nand Nimitz their opinions with regard to three ways proposed for\r\nspeeding up operations: \"(a) By advancing target dates of operations\r\nnow scheduled through operations against Formosa; (b) By by-passing\r\npresently selected objectives prior to operations against Formosa;\r\nand (c) By by-passing presently selected objectives and choosing new\r\nones including the home islands.\" Although the Philippine Islands\r\nwere not explicitly named as targets that might be bypassed, they\r\nwere certainly included by implication. [11]\r\n\r\nOn 18 June General MacArthur replied to the query of the Joint Chiefs,\r\n[12] and on 4 July Admiral Nimitz made known his opinions. [13]\r\nOn the advancement of the target dates, both commanders were in\r\ncomplete agreement--it was impossible unless certain conditions\r\ncould be changed. The logistic resources in the Southwest Pacific\r\nwere being strained to the limit to meet the fixed target dates,\r\nwhile the strengthening of Japanese garrisons made it unlikely that\r\nthe Central Pacific could make its present scheduled dates.\r\n\r\nWith respect to bypassing objectives prior to the seizure of Formosa,\r\nMacArthur thought it would be \"unsound\" to bypass the Philippines\r\nand launch an attack across the Pacific directly against Formosa--an\r\nattack which would have the benefit of no appreciable land-based\r\nair support and which would be based upon the Hawaiian Islands,\r\n5,100 miles away. In his opinion it was essential to occupy Luzon and\r\nestablish land-based aircraft thereon before making any move against\r\nFormosa. [14] Nimitz stated that in a series of informal discussions\r\nbetween his and MacArthur's planning officers, the latter anticipated\r\nthe seizure in early September of Morotai Island, 300 statute miles\r\nsoutheast of Mindanao. This was to be followed in late October by a\r\nlimited occupation of the Sarangani Bay area on Mindanao, which was\r\nto be used primarily as a base for short-range aircraft. The major\r\noperation was to be the occupation of Leyte about 15 November. Nimitz\r\nthought that this timing was \"optimistic.\" He felt that the critical\r\nand decisive nature of the Leyte operation required \"practically all\r\navailable covering and striking forces, fire support forces, and all\r\navailable assault shipping.\" If successful, however, the Americans\r\nwould achieve air supremacy over the Philippines. Therefore, since\r\nthe inclusion of the Leyte operation with that of Mindanao would\r\nexpedite subsequent operations, Nimitz considered it \"advisable.\" [15]\r\n\r\nAs to the feasibility of bypassing present objectives and choosing\r\nnew ones, including the Japanese home islands, the two commanders were\r\nnot in complete agreement. MacArthur pronounced the concept \"utterly\r\nunsound,\" since the available shipping was limited to a seven-division\r\nlift and there was insufficient air support. Nimitz thought that no\r\ndecision should be made until after further developments.\r\n\r\nThe proposals disturbed General MacArthur, who concluded his message\r\nto the Joint Chiefs with the following peroration:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is my opinion that purely military considerations demand\r\n    the reoccupation of the Philippines in order to cut the enemy's\r\n    communications to the south and to secure a base for our further\r\n    advance. Even if this were not the case and unless military\r\n    factors demanded another line of action it would in my opinion\r\n    be necessary to reoccupy the Philippines.\r\n\r\n    The Philippines is American Territory where our unsupported forces\r\n    were destroyed by the enemy. Practically all of the 17,000,000\r\n    Filipinos remain loyal to the United States and are undergoing the\r\n    greatest privation and suffering because we have not been able\r\n    to support or succor them. We have a great national obligation\r\n    to discharge.\r\n\r\n    Moreover, if the United States should deliberately bypass the\r\n    Philippines, leaving our prisoners, nationals, and loyal Filipinos\r\n    in enemy hands without an effort to retrieve them at earliest\r\n    moment, we would incur the gravest psychological reaction. We\r\n    would admit the truth of Japanese propaganda to the effect that\r\n    we had abandoned the Filipinos and would not shed American blood\r\n    to redeem them; we would undoubtedly incur the open hostility\r\n    of that people; we would probably suffer such loss of prestige\r\n    among all the peoples of the Far East that it would adversely\r\n    affect the United States for many years.... [16]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reply, General George C. Marshall, Chief of Staff, cautioned\r\nMacArthur to \"be careful not to let personal feelings and Philippine\r\npolitics\" override the great objective, which was to end the\r\nwar. He also pointed out that \"bypassing\" was not \"synonymous with\r\nabandonment.\" [17]\r\n\r\nAdmiral William F. Halsey, the commander of the Third Fleet, and his\r\nstaff, when they heard of the proposal, were enthusiastic about the\r\npossibility of bypassing the more immediate objectives. But in contrast\r\nto Admiral Ernest J. King, Chief of Naval Operations, who wished to\r\nmove directly to Formosa, bypassing the Philippines, Halsey felt it\r\nnecessary and profitable to go into the Philippine Archipelago, which\r\nhe considered to be \"the vulnerable belly of the Imperial dragon.\" [18]\r\nHalsey stated that when Rear Adm. Robert B. Carney, his chief of staff,\r\nwas asked by King, \"Do you want to make a London out of Manila?\" Carney\r\nreplied, \"No, sir. I want to make an England out of Luzon.\" [19]\r\n\r\nThe Joint Chiefs of Staff concluded that none of the currently\r\nselected objectives could be bypassed. They continued, however, to\r\nsearch for means by which the tempo of the war in the Pacific might\r\nbe accelerated.\r\n\r\nIn the latter days of July, General Marshall invited General MacArthur\r\nto visit Pearl Harbor in order to confer with Admiral Nimitz on future\r\nplans for the war in the Pacific. MacArthur arrived on 26 July. To his\r\nsurprise, the President of the United States was present. President\r\nRoosevelt invited him and Admirals Halsey and Nimitz to dinner. After\r\ndinner the President drew out a map and, pointing to Leyte, is reported\r\nto have said, \"Well, Douglas, where do we go from here?\" [20]\r\n\r\nAlthough Mac Arthur had been given no intimation that strategy was\r\ngoing to be discussed, he launched into a long talk on the necessity\r\nof taking Luzon before moving against Formosa. Nimitz did not enter\r\ninto the conversation. The following morning the discussions were\r\ncontinued. Admiral William D. Leahy, who was present, later declared:\r\n\"Both General MacArthur and Admiral Nimitz felt that they did not\r\nrequire any additional reinforcements or assistance\" for the scheduled\r\noperations. [21] This Admiral Leahy considered most unusual.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Nimitz reported to Admiral King that the conferences \"were\r\nquite satisfactory. The general trend of the discussion ... was along\r\nthe line of seeing MacArthur into the Central Philippines....\" [22]\r\n\r\nThere was no strong disagreement between General MacArthur and Admiral\r\nNimitz. Admiral Leahy said, \"I personally was convinced that they\r\ntogether were the best qualified officers in our service for this\r\ntremendous task, and that they could work together in full agreement\r\ntoward the common end of defeating Japan.\" [23]\r\n\r\nStrong efforts were already under way to accelerate operations in the\r\nPacific. A shortage of shipping appeared to be the bottleneck which\r\nhalted all attempts to speed up the operational target dates. General\r\nMacArthur at Brisbane had been directing the whole of his planning\r\ntoward the reoccupation of the Philippine Islands, and on 10 July had\r\nissued a plan for all operations into the archipelago. According to\r\nthis plan the conquest of the Islands was to be accomplished in four\r\nmajor phases.\r\n\r\nThe initial phase envisaged footholds in the southern and central\r\nPhilippines for the establishment of bases and airfields from which\r\nsubsequent operations could be supported. The first operation, planned\r\nfor 1 November 1944, was to be the seizure of the Sarangani Bay area\r\nin southern Mindanao for the purpose of establishing land-based air\r\nforces to augment the carrier-based air support for the advance into\r\nLeyte. The Leyte operation, the main effort of this series, was to\r\ncome on 22 November. Major air, naval, and logistic bases were to\r\nbe constructed on the shores of Leyte Gulf for the control of Leyte,\r\nSamar, and Surigao Strait, and for the neutralization of the Japanese\r\naerial strength on Luzon. [24] The other phases covered the occupation\r\nof Luzon and the consolidation of the Philippines.\r\n\r\nOn 26 July the Joint Chiefs agreed that the primary purpose of the\r\noccupation of the Leyte-Mindanao area was to establish air forces\r\nthere in order to reduce the enemy air strength on Luzon. Some of\r\nAdmiral Nimitz' assault craft which were suitable for shore-to-shore\r\noperations were to be transferred to General MacArthur. The Joint\r\nChiefs, therefore, asked their planners to submit their views on the\r\npossibility of advancing the target date for Leyte to 15 November by\r\ncompressing the intervals between contemplated operations or by the\r\nelimination of certain scheduled operations. [25]\r\n\r\nIn furtherance of this directive, planning officers from Washington\r\nmet with General MacArthur and his staff in Brisbane in the early\r\npart of August and discussed means of accelerating the target date\r\nfor Leyte. General MacArthur told them that a substantial interval\r\nbetween the operations at Sarangani Bay and Leyte was necessary. His\r\nreasons were as follows: (1) the assault shipping that was used for the\r\nSarangani Bay operation would have time to turn around, reload, and\r\nthen be used for the Leyte operation; (2) in the interval six combat\r\nair groups could be installed in the Sarangani Bay area to support\r\nthe Leyte operation; and (3) the carriers would have sufficient time\r\nto execute two strikes before the Leyte operation. [26]\r\n\r\nThe planners from Washington, however, felt that there was\r\nsufficient assault shipping in the Pacific without using the same\r\ncraft for both the Sarangani Bay and the Leyte operations. An\r\nenumeration of the vessels assigned to the Southwest Pacific and\r\nthe Central Pacific gave the areas more than a six-division lift. As\r\nBrig. Gen. Frank N. Roberts, chief of the Strategy and Policy Group,\r\nOperations Division, War Department General Staff, in Washington,\r\ntold Col. William L. Ritchie, his deputy, who was in Brisbane,\r\n\"If you sit down and look at those figures a bit you will see that\r\nthere should be sufficient assault lift for Leyte just on playing\r\nthe numbers racket, without touching the shipping on Sarangani.\" [27]\r\n\r\nBoth Washington and Brisbane recognized that the operations in the\r\nLeyte-Surigao area were necessary in order to provide air bases, depot\r\nareas, and a fleet anchorage for any future advance whether in the\r\nPhilippines, against Formosa, or by a direct route into the Japanese\r\nhomeland. Consequently, the planners never seriously entertained any\r\nidea of bypassing this area, although they continued to probe for\r\nmeans which would accelerate the target date.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the target date was dependent upon the\r\navailability of assault shipping and the desire of General MacArthur\r\nto have each successive advance supported by land-based aircraft. The\r\nexisting shipping was needed for operations already scheduled. The\r\nplanners concluded that additional shipping could be made available\r\nif certain phases of the campaigns of Central Pacific forces into\r\nthe Palaus, scheduled to start on 15 September, were canceled or\r\nset ahead of schedule. The alternatives were to modify the concept\r\nof providing land-based air support for subsequent operations or to\r\nexecute the Sarangani Bay and Leyte operations simultaneously. [28]\r\nThere the matter rested. Apparently the Joint Chiefs had decided that\r\nthe time was not opportune for an acceleration of the target dates.\r\n\r\nOn 27 August General MacArthur furnished General Marshall a timetable\r\nfor future operations by his forces. On 15 September a division and\r\na reinforced regiment were to seize Morotai in order \"to protect\r\nthe western flank\" and to provide land-based aircraft for advances\r\nnorthward. On 15 October a division less one regimental combat team\r\nwas to land in the Talaud Islands northwest of Morotai in order \"to\r\nneutralize the [Japanese] western flank,\" to establish air bases\r\nfrom which the neutralization of Mindanao and the western Visayan\r\nIslands could be accomplished, and to set up a base for airborne\r\ntroops. On 15 November two divisions were to land in the Sarangani\r\nBay area in order to construct bases for land-based aircraft that\r\nwere to support the Leyte operation. On 7 December a regimental\r\ncombat team and a parachute battalion were to drop on Mindanao and\r\nestablish an airfield for fighter cover for the aerial neutralization\r\nof the western Visayan Islands and southern Luzon. On 20 December\r\nfive divisions were to land on Leyte for the purpose of providing\r\n\"major air and logistic bases for operations to the northward.\" The\r\nplan was predicated on the assumption that there would be available\r\nin the Pacific sufficient amphibious lift and fleet support. [29]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlans Agreed Upon\r\n\r\nOn 1 September 1944 the Joint Chiefs of Staff in their 171st meeting\r\nreviewed the situation in the Pacific. The time had come when it\r\nwas necessary to issue a directive for future operations in that\r\narea. After much discussion, the Joint Chiefs left in abeyance the\r\nquestion of what operation should follow Leyte but \"directed the Joint\r\nStaff Planners to prepare, as a matter of urgency, a directive to the\r\nCommander in Chief, Southwest Pacific Area, and the Commander in Chief,\r\nPacific Ocean Areas, to carry out the Leyte operation.\" [30]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on 8 September, the two commanders were given the\r\nfollowing missions: General MacArthur, after conducting the necessary\r\npreliminary operations, was to take the Leyte-Surigao area on 20\r\nDecember, with Admiral Nimitz furnishing fleet support and additional\r\nassault shipping. Both commanders were to arrange for co-ordination\r\nof plans and mutual support of operations; to co-ordinate plans with\r\nGeneral Joseph W. Stilwell, Commanding General, United States Army\r\nforces, China, Burma and India, in order to get maximum support from\r\nthat theater; and to arrange with General Henry H. Arnold, Commanding\r\nGeneral, Twentieth Air Force, for supporting operations. [31]\r\n\r\nConcurrently with the issuance of this directive, momentous events\r\nwere taking place in the Pacific. Admiral Halsey was in command of\r\nscheduled operations against the Palau Islands. On 7 and 8 September\r\naircraft from his carriers struck at Yap and the Palau Islands,\r\nagainst which Admiral Nimitz had scheduled operations, and for the\r\nnext two days bombed Mindanao. On the 12th and 14th the bombers hit\r\nthe central Philippines in support of the operations against the\r\nPalau Islands and Morotai.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Halsey advised Admiral Nimitz that, as a result of the strikes,\r\nfew serviceable planes in the Philippines were left to the Japanese,\r\nthe bulk of the enemy's oil supplies was destroyed, there was \"no\r\nshipping left to sink,\" the \"enemy's non-aggressive attitude [was]\r\nunbelievable and fantastic,\" and \"the area is wide open.\" [32]\r\nHalsey also told Nimitz that one of his downed carrier pilots had\r\nbeen told by his Filipino rescuers that there were no Japanese on\r\nLeyte. [33] He therefore felt that it was time to accelerate the\r\noperations in the Pacific, and he strongly recommended that the\r\nintermediate operations--Yap, Talaud, and the Sarangani Bay area on\r\nMindanao--be canceled. Leyte could be seized immediately and cheaply\r\nwithout any intermediate operations. Halsey's fleet could cover the\r\ninitial landing until land-based aircraft could be established. The\r\nforce intended for the occupation of Yap could be made available to\r\nGeneral MacArthur. [34]\r\n\r\nWhen this message was received, the Combined Chiefs of Staff were\r\nattending a conference in Quebec. The recommendations were transmitted\r\nto Quebec by Admiral Nimitz, who offered to place at MacArthur's\r\ndisposal the III Amphibious Force, including the XXIV Corps, which\r\nwas loading at Pearl Harbor for Yap. General Marshall so informed\r\nGeneral MacArthur and asked his opinion on the proposed change of\r\ntarget date. [35]\r\n\r\nThe message reached MacArthur's headquarters at Hollandia, on New\r\nGuinea, while MacArthur was en route to Morotai and observing radio\r\nsilence. His chief of staff advised General Marshall that although the\r\ninformation from the rescued pilot that there were no Japanese on Leyte\r\nwas incorrect, the intermediate operations could be eliminated. The\r\n1st Cavalry Division and the 24th Infantry Division with sufficient\r\nservice troops were available for the Leyte operation; adequate air\r\nstrength could be provided; the logistic support was practicable;\r\nand the XXIV Corps could be used. [36]\r\n\r\nGeneral Marshall received this answer at Quebec on 15 September while\r\nhe, Admiral Leahy, Admiral King, and General Arnold were at a formal\r\ndinner given by Canadian officers. The Americans withdrew from the\r\ntable for a conference. Within an hour and a half after the message\r\narrived, the Joint Chiefs ordered MacArthur and Nimitz to cancel\r\nthe three intermediate operations of Yap, Talaud, and Sarangani,\r\nco-ordinate their plans, and invade Leyte on 20 October. [37]\r\n\r\nLater that evening, as he was on his way to his quarters after the\r\ndinner, General Marshall received this message: \"Subject to completion\r\nof arrangements with Nimitz, we shall execute Leyte operation on 20\r\nOctober.... MacArthur.\" [38]\r\n\r\nOn 3 October the Joint Chiefs of Staff directed General MacArthur\r\nto occupy Luzon on 20 December 1944, the date originally set for\r\nthe entrance into Leyte. [39] The decision had been made. General\r\nMacArthur was to return to the Philippine Islands in force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nThe Nature of the Target\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Philippine Islands, the largest island group in the Malay\r\nArchipelago, were discovered by Ferdinand Magellan in 1521. They became\r\na Spanish possession in 1565 and remained so until 10 December 1898\r\nwhen they were ceded to the United States by the Treaty of Paris as\r\na result of the Spanish-American war. In the spring of 1942 Japan\r\nsecured military domination over the Islands.\r\n\r\nThe Philippine Archipelago lay in the geographical heart of the Far\r\nEastern theater of war. As a pivotal point of control the Islands were\r\ncentrally placed in relation to Japan, China, Burma, French Indochina,\r\nThailand, British Malaya, and the Netherlands Indies. Being the most\r\nnortherly part of the Malay Archipelago, the Philippines were also\r\nclose to the vital areas of Japan and the Chinese-held areas of the\r\nAsiatic mainland. Located southeast of the continent, they occupy\r\nmuch the same position with respect to the mainland of Asia that the\r\nWest Indies do with respect to North America.\r\n\r\nThe Islands are among the remnants of a great continent that once\r\nextended over the space now occupied by the entire East Indies. There\r\nare some 7,100 islands and islets in the Philippine Archipelago, which\r\nhas a land area of 114,830 square miles. Of these, about 460 have an\r\narea of one square mile or more and 2,773 are named. The Philippine\r\nIslands are divided into three main groups--Luzon and adjacent islands\r\nin the northern sector; the Visayan Islands in the central portion,\r\ncomprising Samar, Leyte, and numerous others; and finally, in the\r\nsouthern part, Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago. The Philippines\r\nhad a prewar population of about 16,000,000, of whom 14,550,000 were\r\nChristians, 678,000 were Mohammedans, 626,000 were pagans, and about\r\n64,000 were Buddhists and Shintoists. [40]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography of Leyte\r\n\r\nThe northeastern Visayan group, which consists mainly of Leyte\r\nand Samar, was selected as the point of entrance into the\r\nPhilippines. Leyte had the higher potential military value. The\r\nair distance from the capital city of Tacloban to Manila is 295\r\nmiles. Leyte is a natural gateway to the rest of the Philippines, and\r\nits possession would greatly facilitate and support further operations\r\nto the north as well as expedite control over the remaining islands\r\nin the Visayan group. [41]\r\n\r\nLeyte roughly resembles a molar tooth with its crown toward Samar\r\nand its roots pointing to Mindanao. The eighth largest island in the\r\nPhilippines, with an area of 2,785 square miles, it runs generally from\r\nnorth to south, with an approximate length of 115 miles and a width\r\nof 15 to 45 miles. It is situated on one of the principal submerged\r\nshelves of the Philippine Archipelago, and the waters over the shelf\r\nhave an average depth of 22 fathoms. (Map 2--inside back cover)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Terrain\r\n\r\nThe island is mainly volcanic in origin. A range of mountains, the\r\ntopographical backbone of the island, extends southeast from Biliran\r\nStrait in the north to Cabalian Bay in the south and separates the\r\nLeyte and Ormoc Valleys. All of southern Leyte is mountainous and,\r\nmilitarily speaking, of little importance. The northwest coast is\r\nalso rugged, and except for the port of Palompon has little tactical\r\nsignificance. The heavily forested central mountain range is composed\r\nof numerous knifelike ridges and spurs and deep ravines and serves as\r\nan effective natural barrier between the island's eastern and western\r\ncoastal areas. It is a major obstacle to the rapid movement of troops\r\nand can be utilized very effectively in defending the island.\r\n\r\nLeyte Valley, a broad and fertile plain, stretches across the\r\nnortheastern part of the island from Leyte Gulf to Carigara Bay. More\r\nthan twenty-five miles wide along the shore of the gulf, it is\r\ngradually narrowed by the mountain ranges to the north and south to\r\nless than ten miles as it reaches Carigara Bay. Most of the island's\r\npopulation live in this valley, and here too are most of the principal\r\ncities and airfields.\r\n\r\nThe main road net of the island runs through Leyte Valley, a\r\ngreat number of streams interlacing it. The numerous rice paddies,\r\ncenturies old, disrupt the natural drainage of the valley. Rarely\r\nis the water level more than a few inches below the surface. Even\r\nin the drier months, vehicular movement is limited to the existing\r\nroads. In 1944 these were poor, inadequate, and ill suited for heavy\r\nmilitary traffic. The best of them had only a light bituminous surface\r\nand were neither wide enough nor strong enough for two-way military\r\ntraffic. [42] It was hoped that Leyte Valley could be developed into\r\na large air and logistical base to support further operations, but\r\nit was not well suited for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe shore line of Leyte Valley along Leyte Gulf and San Pedro Bay\r\naffords the best landing beaches on the island. This coast is\r\ndangerous for beach landings during northeast monsoon periods,\r\nwhen heavy surf, high winds, and torrential rains imperil men,\r\nequipment, and shipping. July, August, and September are the best\r\nmonths for landing. In general there are good firm sand beaches,\r\nonto which landing craft can go directly. A road parallels the shore\r\nline, but there are few exit roads from the beach to this road and\r\nbeyond. In many places close to the shore there are swamps and rice\r\npaddies which prevent rapid egress from the beach. There are other\r\ngood landing beaches on the east coast of Ormoc Bay, but they are\r\ncrossed by innumerable creeks and streams.\r\n\r\nLeyte Gulf is large and open, offering an excellent anchorage\r\nfor a considerable number of vessels, including those of largest\r\nsize. Carigara Bay, to the north of the island, is twenty miles wide,\r\nbut shallow waters, swamps, and the hilly terrain of its eastern and\r\nwestern sides restrict its value for military operations. A narrow neck\r\nof the central mountain range separates the bay from the northern end\r\nof Ormoc Valley. San Juanico Strait, which separates Leyte from Samar\r\nin the north, connects Carigara Bay and San Pedro Bay, the latter being\r\na northern extension of Leyte Gulf. The strait is thirteen and a half\r\nmiles long with an average width of a quarter to a half mile. Small\r\nlanding craft can navigate the channel, but there are strong tidal\r\ncurrents which cause violent rips and swirls at many points.\r\n\r\nWedged in between the central mountain range and the hill mass of the\r\nnorthwest coast of Leyte, the Ormoc Valley, about five miles wide in\r\nits largest part, extends from Ormoc Bay to the north for fifteen miles\r\nwhere a narrow neck of the central ridge separates it from Carigara\r\nBay. Through the valley runs a narrow road, its northern portion marked\r\nby steep grades and sharp curves. Halfway along, a branch road zigzags\r\nits course to Port Palompon on the west coast. Although most of the\r\nsouthern part of the valley is under cultivation, there are large\r\npatches of forest, scrub growth, and cogon grass in the north. [43]\r\n\r\nThe largest city on the island, the provincial capital, is Tacloban,\r\nwhich lies at the head of San Pedro Bay. As the only sizable port in\r\nthe area, it handles most of the outbound shipping, mainly from Leyte\r\nand Samar. Its prewar population was about 31,000. Other important\r\ntowns are Carigara and Barugo on the north coast; Baybay and Ormoc,\r\nthe leading ports on the west coast; and Palo, Tanauan, and Abuyog\r\nalong the east coast. All the more significant towns are situated on\r\nthe main road system of the island, and the larger coastal barrios\r\n(villages) have roads of a sort.\r\n\r\nThe road system is divided into a northern and a southern coastal\r\nroad net. The former, which is the better, was designed for the\r\ntransportation of agricultural produce from the northern interior areas\r\nto Tacloban. The latter is composed of narrow, roundabout roads that\r\nare constantly in need of repair. The two systems are joined by a road,\r\nscarcely better than a trail, which runs west of Abuyog and corkscrews\r\nits way through heavily forested mountains to Baybay. Another road,\r\nlong, narrow, and broken in parts, goes north from Baybay to Ormoc\r\nand thence through the Ormoc Valley to Carigara.\r\n\r\nThe Tacloban airstrip, the principal airfield on the island, was\r\nlocated on the Cataisan Peninsula, which lies just southeast of\r\nTacloban. The Japanese had constructed another airfield, known as\r\nthe Dulag airstrip, two miles west of Dulag; three others--the Buri,\r\nBayug, and San Pablo airstrips--near Burauen, five miles west of Dulag;\r\nand still another at Valencia in the Ormoc Valley, eight miles north\r\nof Ormoc.\r\n\r\nControl of the island of Leyte is dependent upon control of the Leyte\r\nand Ormoc Valleys and their adjacent hills and mountains. Thus, before\r\na successful movement into Leyte Valley could be assured, control of\r\nthe high ground in the vicinity of Palo would be essential. Continued\r\ndominance over the valley is dependent upon control of the high ground\r\nat its northwestern end in the vicinity of Pinamopoan on Carigara Bay,\r\npossession of which would preclude infiltration from Ormoc Valley. The\r\ncontrol of Ormoc Valley and use of the excellent anchorage and harbor\r\nfacilities of Ormoc Bay is dependent upon control of the lowland in\r\nthe vicinity of Ormoc city and the commanding hills to the east.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe People\r\n\r\nIn 1939 the total population of Leyte was 915,853, of whom more\r\nthan 912,000 were native Visayans of Malaysian stock. The largest\r\nother group consisted of 3,076 Chinese, half of whom were engaged\r\nin retail trade. There was a sprinkling of other national groups--40\r\nSpaniards, 20 Germans, 81 from other European countries, 56 Americans,\r\nand 73 Japanese.\r\n\r\nBecause of their insular position and somewhat primitive culture,\r\nthe inhabitants are primarily an agricultural and fishing people. The\r\nprincipal crops are rice, sugar cane, corn, and copra. Judged by\r\nOccidental standards, the mode of farming is backward and shows\r\nlittle tendency to progress. The Filipinos who have been exposed\r\nto industrial life, however, have been able to adapt themselves to\r\nemployment in the limited trade crafts and manufacturing on the island.\r\n\r\nAccording to his own standards, the Filipino lives well enough. His\r\nchief foods are rice or corn, fish, camotes (sweet potatoes), and\r\noccasionally chicken or other meat. The men's clothing is simple;\r\nthe average man has several changes of cheap cotton shirts and pants\r\nmade of imported cotton cloth or, in the more remote districts,\r\nfrom homespun material.\r\n\r\nMost of the dwelling houses are made of bamboo and sheathed with\r\npalm leaves on roof and sides. The material is gathered locally and\r\ntied with rattan. The houses rarely consist of more than two rooms,\r\nand many are raised on pilings, with space for the family pig and\r\nchickens underneath. In one of the rooms, or outdoors, is an open\r\nfireplace with a mud and stone hearth for cooking. There is little\r\nfurniture, and in three out of four families the personal possessions\r\nwould not be worth more than ten dollars.\r\n\r\nLess than 5 percent of the people have a rising standard of\r\nliving. This higher standard is exemplified by a better type of\r\nhabitation, which ranges from a three-room house to a dwelling similar\r\nto that of the American middle class. The diet of more prosperous\r\nFilipinos is basically the same as that of the poorer class, but it\r\noffers a greater variety. Clothing follows the Occidental fashion. The\r\nwealthiest people and those with foreign education or contacts, who\r\nmake up less than 1 percent of the population, dress and live in the\r\nsame manner as Occidentals.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese, during their occupation, governed through the old\r\nadministrative organization of the province. They and their puppet\r\nofficials also set up larger governing bodies that exercised superior\r\njurisdiction. On 6 February 1944 the puppet president of the Philippine\r\nRepublic, José Laurel, appointed a commissioner who held supervisory\r\npower over the local governments in the Visayan Provinces.\r\n\r\nThe governor of the province of Leyte, who previously had been\r\nan elected official, was appointed by the president. He was the\r\nchief operative and administrative head of the province and on all\r\nprovincial administrative matters his decision was final. The treasurer\r\nof the province, who reported directly to the governor, was its chief\r\nfinancial officer and tax assessor. He collected all taxes and license\r\nfees, national and local, and prepared financial statements for the\r\ngovernor but he had no say in administrative matters. The law officer\r\nof the province was legal adviser to the governor and to the municipal\r\nauthorities. He could advise only on administrative matters.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Military Administration maintained liaison between\r\nthe Japanese Army and the civil government. The military police\r\ncollected military intelligence and information and disseminated\r\npropaganda. The Japanese allowed only one political party on the\r\nIslands--the Kalibapi--to which all government officials were\r\nrequired to belong. This party was one of the principal propaganda\r\nagencies, being the prime mover of the pacification programs in the\r\nprovince, and exercised general supervision over the local neighborhood\r\nassociations. The latter helped in maintaining law and order, assisted\r\nthe constabulary, and aided in the distribution of scarce commodities.\r\n\r\nIt should be emphasized that during most of the occupation there were\r\nfew Japanese on Leyte. Southern Leyte in general maintained the same\r\nFilipino institutions and officials as in the prewar years. The heel\r\nof the Japanese conqueror pressed but lightly on most of the people\r\nof Leyte. Beginning in early 1944, however, the Japanese Army forces\r\non the island were reinforced. From that time forward the Filipinos\r\nhad their crops appropriated and in other ways were subjected to the\r\nwill of the Japanese. Misery, hunger, and poverty became commonplace\r\nand a resistance movement grew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Resistance Movement on Leyte\r\n\r\nThe Organizing of Guerrilla Bands\r\n\r\nA period of uncertainty and confusion followed the surrender of the\r\nAmerican and Filipino forces in the Philippines in the spring of\r\n1942. Civilians and members of the armed forces who did not surrender\r\nto the Japanese Army fled into the hills. Some went because they wanted\r\nto continue the fight, others because they felt that the chaotic\r\nconditions on the Islands would afford unequaled opportunities for\r\nlooting and pillaging.\r\n\r\nOnce in the hills, the men formed themselves into guerrilla bands. [44]\r\nAt first all of the bands, because of their lack of money and supplies,\r\nfreely raided farms and storehouses for food and equipment whenever\r\nthey had the opportunity. Moreover, there were real bandit groups\r\nwho frequently and wantonly raped the countryside. For a time all\r\nof the groups were discredited by the people. Gradually, however,\r\nstrong men emerged who formed the guerrilla bands into semi-military\r\norganizations. The leader of each band, who was generally an ex-member\r\nof the armed forces, gave himself a \"bamboo commission,\" usually\r\nconsiderably higher than the one he had hitherto possessed.\r\n\r\nThe following oath of allegiance taken by the members of one of the\r\nbands is probably typical:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I do solemnly swear that I shall obey orders from my superior\r\n    officer; that I shall fight the enemy of the Government of\r\n    the Commonwealth of the Philippines and the United States of\r\n    America whosoever and wherever he maybe [sic] in the territory\r\n    of the Philippines; that I shall never allow myself nor any\r\n    arm or ammunition to be caught by the enemy; that I shall never\r\n    turn traitor to my country nor the United States of America; and\r\n    muchless [sic] reveal to the enemy any secret of the Army to which\r\n    I honorably belong; that I shall never abandon a wounded brother\r\n    in arms; that I join the United Forces in the Philippines without\r\n    personal or party interest, but with the determination to sacrifice\r\n    myself and all that is mine for FREEDOM and DEMOCRACY; that I shall\r\n    protect the lives and property of all loyal Filipinos everywhere.\r\n\r\n    I make this LOYALTY OATH without mental reservation or purpose\r\n    of evasion.\r\n\r\n    SO HELP ME GOD. [45]\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some time the various guerrilla bands on Leyte operated separately,\r\nand there was little or no co-operation between them. They were united,\r\nhowever, in their hatred of the Japanese. Jealousy and strife between\r\ngroups were rampant, but circumstances gradually compelled the smaller\r\nbands to submit to absorption, either by force or persuasion, into\r\nthe larger and more powerful groups. The fact that there were few\r\nJapanese on the island enabled the guerrillas and loyal provincial\r\nofficials to organize the governments of most of the barrios.\r\n\r\nAll of the guerrillas declared that their primary purpose was to aid\r\nthe civilians, maintain peace and order, and keep the Japanese from\r\nabusing the people. They also assumed control over various phases\r\nof public activities--the allotment of food supplies, the issue of\r\nemergency currency, and the punishment of criminals. The guerrillas\r\nin northern Leyte depended upon voluntary contributions to support\r\nthem, while those in southern Leyte levied a loyalty tax. Hard money\r\nhaving been driven out of circulation, the guerrilla units tried to\r\nissue paper, which was acceptable only in those regions where the\r\nparticular unit was active. There was no widespread circulation or\r\nacceptance of any of the guerrilla money.\r\n\r\nThe most important of the guerrilla leaders on Leyte were\r\nLt. Col. Ruperto K. Kangleon and Brig. Gen. Blas E. Miranda. Colonel\r\nKangleon had served for twenty-seven years in the Philippine Army\r\nand was a graduate of the Philippine Academy and General Service\r\nSchool. General Miranda, [46] a former member of the Philippine\r\nConstabulary, was very hostile to the Japanese and to anyone who\r\nsurrendered to them. He killed many former prisoners, whom the Japanese\r\nhad released, on the pretext that they were enemy spies. Miranda was\r\nespecially bitter toward Kangleon, a former prisoner of the enemy.\r\n\r\nOfficial recognition from General MacArthur's headquarters was\r\nslow in reaching the guerrillas on Leyte, a fact that brought about\r\nmisunderstandings. General MacArthur had early established contact with\r\nCol. Macario Peralta on Panay and Col. Wendell Fertig on Mindanao. In\r\nthe middle of February 1943 MacArthur sent Lt. Comdr. Charles Parsons,\r\nUSNR, to the Islands by submarine. Before his departure, General\r\nHeadquarters had established the policies to be followed. The prewar\r\nmilitary districts, as of December 1940, were to be revived. [47] Since\r\nGeneral MacArthur had received information that Colonel Fertig had\r\nsuccessfully created an effective guerrilla organization on Mindanao\r\nand Colonel Peralta one on Panay, he recognized them as commanders of\r\nthe 10th and 6th Military Districts, respectively. Radio communication\r\nfrom MacArthur's headquarters informed Peralta and Fertig of the\r\nappointments on 21 February 1943. Commander Parsons also carried\r\nformal letters, dated 13 February 1943, making these appointments.\r\n\r\nParsons safely reached the Philippines in early March and established\r\nfriendly relations with Colonel Fertig. While on Mindanao he made\r\nseveral local trips, one to southern Leyte where he heard of Colonel\r\nKangleon who had escaped from the Butuan prison camp and returned to\r\nhis home. Parsons visited Kangleon with the promise that he would\r\nbe made commander of the 9th Military District (Leyte and Samar),\r\nand succeeded in persuading him to join the guerrilla movement on\r\nLeyte. [48]\r\n\r\nUntil area commanders could be selected for the 7th, 8th, and\r\n9th (Leyte) Districts, Peralta and Fertig had been authorized by\r\nMacArthur's headquarters, through Parsons, to organize the guerrillas\r\non neighboring islands, as well as on their own. Each thought he\r\nwas to organize the guerrillas on Leyte. Peralta made contact with\r\nGeneral Miranda on northwestern Leyte; Fertig got in touch with\r\nColonel Kangleon. Both Peralta and Fertig told their contacts to\r\norganize Leyte with the official sanction of General MacArthur's\r\nheadquarters. Consequently, Kangleon and Miranda each thought the\r\nother to be a usurper. [49]\r\n\r\nMiranda was adamant in his refusal to treat with Kangleon. Colonel\r\nKangleon thought that Miranda should be ordered to \"forget his\r\nestablished kingdom,\" but if this failed, he declared, the 92d\r\nDivision, commanded by himself, would \"force ... Miranda to join\r\nus.\" [50]\r\n\r\nThe situation became extremely tense, since both Kangleon and Miranda\r\nfelt much bitterness. In August 1943 Kangleon sent a force against\r\nMiranda and during a clash between the two parties some of the men\r\nwere killed. Miranda was routed and many of his followers joined\r\nKangleon. [51] The power of Miranda was broken. Kangleon incorporated\r\nthe other guerrillas on the island into the 92d Division, and Leyte\r\nwas then unified under his command.\r\n\r\nOn 21 October 1943 General MacArthur recognized Colonel Kangleon as the\r\nLeyte Area Commander, and in a letter accompanying the appointment he\r\ntold Kangleon what he expected of him. \"I desire that you establish and\r\nmaintain direct communication with this headquarters at your earliest\r\nopportunity and thereafter you keep me informed of major developments\r\ninvolving enemy movement, dispositions and other activity within your\r\narea and observation.\" [52]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJapanese Punitive Expeditions\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of 1943 the Japanese military authorities tried to\r\nconciliate the guerrillas, offering, in return for their surrender,\r\nnot only freedom from punishment but also jobs and the opportunity to\r\nresume their normal family life. A great many guerrillas took advantage\r\nof this offer of amnesty and surrendered. [53] Among the guerrilla\r\nunits that surrendered to the Japanese were those of Maj. Marcos\r\nG. Soliman and other subordinates of General Miranda's command. [54]\r\nThey gave themselves up in January 1944, but General Miranda himself\r\nrefused to surrender and left for either Cebu or Bohol.\r\n\r\nAfter their attempts at pacification, the Japanese launched more\r\nfrequent and intensive patrols against the guerrillas. The garrison\r\ntroops that had been stationed on Leyte were reinforced. Southern\r\nLeyte, which had known few Japanese, was \"reinvolved\" on 8 December\r\n1943. The guerrillas withdrew and hid in the interior. It was\r\nthought that after a month the troops would leave and be replaced by\r\nconstabulary officers. But after two weeks the Japanese turned their\r\nattention to the civilians. Some they arrested and imprisoned for\r\ndays without food and water, others they tortured and executed. Houses\r\nwere broken into, property was looted, and food was stolen. Spies were\r\nbrought in from neighboring islands to locate the guerrilla hideouts.\r\n\r\nSince the people begged for action, Colonel Kangleon held a meeting of\r\nhis unit commanders on 24 January 1944. With his officers in unanimous\r\naccord, he issued an order to fight, commencing on 1 February 1944. All\r\nofficers and enlisted men of his command signed a loyalty oath that\r\nthey would not allow either themselves or their weapons to be captured.\r\n\r\nFrom 1 February until 12 June, according to Colonel Kangleon, the\r\nguerrillas in southern Leyte had only 10 casualties. In a report\r\ndated 18 May 1944, the Japanese casualties were listed as 434 killed,\r\nof whom 4 were officers, and 205 wounded.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese commander in Leyte made quite a different report. He\r\nstated that from 1 January to 31 August his forces had taken part\r\nin 561 engagements with the guerrillas. They had seized 7 vehicles;\r\n7 generators; 37 radios and other items of wireless equipment;\r\n1,556 weapons, including rifles, bayonets, and homemade shotguns;\r\nand 55,348 rounds of ammunition, as well as sticks of dynamite. The\r\nJapanese declared that they had taken 2,300 prisoners of war, including\r\n3 Americans; that 6 Americans and 23,077 Filipinos had surrendered;\r\n1,984 guerrillas had been killed; and that the Japanese casualties\r\namounted to 7 officers and 208 enlisted men killed, and 11 officers\r\nand 147 men wounded. [55]\r\n\r\nIn the month of October 1944 General MacArthur's Military Intelligence\r\nSection estimated that the strength of the guerrilla 92d Division\r\nwas as follows: Headquarters, Leyte Area Command, 23 officers and\r\n107 enlisted men; 94th Regiment, 71 officers and 1,210 enlisted men;\r\n95th Regiment, 78 officers and 954 enlisted men; 96th Regiment,\r\n37 officers and 710 enlisted men; total strength, 209 officers and\r\n2,981 enlisted men. [56]\r\n\r\nColonel Kangleon stated that as a result of guerrilla activities the\r\nJapanese sent out fewer patrols, staying mainly in the towns. The\r\ncivilians, he claimed, were therefore able to plant and harvest their\r\ncrops. Despite these brave words the guerrillas were definitely on\r\nthe defensive, since Japanese intelligence had accurate information on\r\ntheir movements and strength. Nevertheless, the Japanese also knew that\r\nthe guerrillas had established communication with General MacArthur\r\nin Australia and that they were sending important information to\r\nGeneral Headquarters. This service the Japanese were unable to cut off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLiaison Between Leyte and Australia\r\n\r\nAfter his arrival in Australia in March 1942, General MacArthur had\r\nmaintained radio contact with Corregidor until 6 May, but because\r\nof conditions in the Philippines radio communication with other\r\nparts of the Islands was all but impossible. [57] Before its fall,\r\nCorregidor maintained radio contact with military commanders on the\r\nother islands. Afterward, a few men escaped and made their way to\r\nAustralia. The sum of information they brought was not large, but it\r\nincluded the welcome news that guerrilla units were in existence all\r\nover the Islands. In the summer of 1942 General Headquarters began\r\nto receive messages from the guerrillas in the Philippines, though\r\nat first General MacArthur was not sure that the messages actually\r\ncame from the guerrillas.\r\n\r\nIn August 1942 MacArthur decided to get in touch with the members of\r\nthe resistance movement in the Philippines, and for this purpose he\r\nenlisted the services of Maj. Jesus Antonio Villamor, who had escaped\r\nfrom the Islands and who volunteered to return. [58] From August\r\nto December methods were devised and plans were made for sending\r\nan intelligence party to the Philippines. [59] On 27 December 1942\r\nMajor Villamor received orders to return secretly to the Islands by\r\nsubmarine with three other Filipino officers and two enlisted men. [60]\r\nThey were instructed to establish an intelligence and secret service\r\nnetwork throughout the Philippines; develop a chain of communications\r\nwithin the Philippines and to Australia, together with an escape route\r\nfrom the Islands for the evacuation of important personages; build\r\nup an organization for subversive activities, propaganda, limited\r\nresistance, and sabotage; and make an intelligence survey to obtain\r\ninformation on Japanese political, military, and civil intentions\r\nas well as the strength and disposition of Japanese military, naval,\r\nand air forces. [61]\r\n\r\nArmed with these instructions, Major Villamor returned to the\r\nPhilippine Islands. Slowly but carefully, from December 1942 to\r\nNovember 1943, he established an intelligence network that covered\r\nLuzon and the Visayan Islands. His story is told in part as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I established this network principally with the idea that this net\r\n    would be entirely independent of all intelligence nets previously\r\n    established by the guerrillas, believing that in all probability\r\n    you [General MacArthur] could rely more on guerrilla intelligence\r\n    activities for the present. I wanted to establish something that\r\n    would really be underground and as secret as possible. For that\r\n    reason, I took my time about it. I took as much as two months to\r\n    train each individual man. I tried to impress on each man that\r\n    after he left my place, he would be on his own and that no matter\r\n    what happened to me or to the rest of the net, he would carry\r\n    on. I assured him that both GHQ and I would have faith in him. [62]\r\n\r\n\r\nKangleon was largely responsible for the Leyte radio network. This\r\nintelligence network did not cover the entire island but only those\r\npositions over which he had control. General MacArthur did not furnish\r\nany considerable supplies for this net until shortly before his return\r\nin October 1944. [63] On 3 July 1944 Kangleon received seventy tons\r\nof supplies; an additional shipment of supplies and men followed on\r\n20 July. [64] This allotment was in addition to money sent him. The\r\nfunds available to Kangleon consisted of $50,000 in prewar currency\r\n(\"only a few hundred\" of which were spent by him), $225,000 in \"bogus\r\nJapanese\" currency, and $479,198 in emergency currency printed in\r\nthe Islands and used for \"army\" purposes. [65]\r\n\r\nSeveral clandestine radio stations were in operation on or near\r\nLeyte in June 1944. These were primarily contact stations established\r\noriginally to integrate more closely the activities of the various\r\nguerrilla units with the directives of Colonel Kangleon's headquarters,\r\nwhich was in touch with General Headquarters. After the Leyte Area\r\nCommand was recognized by General MacArthur, the first radio was sent\r\nto Leyte, but the Japanese captured it early in 1944 before it could\r\nbe put to use. Kangleon received a new set from Mindanao. There were\r\ntwo coastwatcher stations in operation--one in southern Leyte and\r\nthe other on Dinagat Island. These furnished MacArthur information\r\non the activities of the Japanese in the area. Colonel Kangleon also\r\nused the radio set in southern Leyte to maintain contact with Colonel\r\nFertig on Mindanao. [66]\r\n\r\nAs a result of information received from the intelligence network,\r\non Leyte and in other areas, together with information from other\r\nsources, General MacArthur's intelligence officers were able to piece\r\ntogether a reasonably accurate picture of the Japanese units on Leyte,\r\ntheir strength, dispositions, and fortifications.\r\n\r\nKangleon's network, however, was not as active as most of the\r\nothers in the Philippines that were operated by coastwatchers and\r\nguerrillas. From March 1944, when Kangleon's network was established,\r\nto October 1944, when the American forces returned, the monthly\r\ntotals of messages received by General Headquarters from Leyte were\r\nas follows: March, 6; April, 7; May, 7; June, 12; July, 13; August,\r\n13; September, 17; and October, 26. [67]\r\n\r\nThe guerrillas of the Philippine Islands made far-reaching\r\ncontributions to the war effort. They were an extremely valuable source\r\nof intelligence; their activities forced the Japanese to retain in\r\nthe Philippines comparatively large forces which would otherwise have\r\nbeen sent south; it is estimated that they killed from eight thousand\r\nto ten thousand Japanese troops; and, finally, they bolstered the\r\nmorale, spirit, and loyalty of the Filipino people. [68] They kept\r\nalive the hope and belief that the forces of the United States would\r\nreturn and redeem the Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nPlans Are Made and Forces Are Readied\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimate of the Enemy Situation\r\n\r\nAmerican knowledge of the Japanese forces on Leyte was derived\r\nfrom many sources. [69] The guerrillas on Leyte and other islands\r\nin the archipelago sent information to Australia on the movements,\r\ndispositions, fortifications, and defenses of the Japanese. Commander\r\nParsons, on his submarine trips to the Islands, brought back with\r\nhim important intelligence. Just before the invasion an intelligence\r\nofficer from Sixth Army and one from the Seventh Fleet secretly went\r\nashore from a submarine and gathered material on Japanese coastal\r\nfortifications and defenses in the beach area.\r\n\r\nMuch effort was expended before the invasion in mapping the island,\r\nbut this work was based on prewar maps and the results were very\r\ninaccurate. Since much of the island was under heavy fog for long\r\nperiods, the photomaps that were produced had little value. They\r\nmissed many important terrain features and misplaced others by\r\nthousands of yards. In general, however, the maps of the beachhead\r\nareas were accurate.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1944 General MacArthur's headquarters received\r\ninformation that the Japanese were starting to reinforce their\r\nPhilippine garrisons. An early estimate, made in June, put the\r\nnumber of enemy troops on the island at 20,000, a sharp increase\r\nover the 5,900 of the previous month. The increase resulted from\r\nthe movement to Leyte from Samar of the veteran 16th Division, which\r\nhad fought at Bataan, and the arrival of 4,000 naval troops from the\r\nPalau Islands. [70] For the next month reports flowed in to General\r\nHeadquarters that the 16th Division was building coastal defenses and\r\nair-raid shelters, and improving the airfields and garrison defenses\r\nof the island. [71]\r\n\r\nIn July 1944 the Americans received information that all was not\r\ngoing well in the Japanese homeland. From a radio interception\r\nthey learned that Premier Hideki Tojo and his entire cabinet had\r\nresigned on 18 July. The Japanese message stated: \"The situation is\r\nthe result of the period of 'sweating blood' and we sincerely regret\r\ncausing anxiety to the Emperor. We thank the people at home and at the\r\nfront for co-operating with the government....\" [72] The tenor of the\r\nannouncement and of subsequent statements made it abundantly clear,\r\nhowever, that the Japanese were determined to do their utmost toward\r\nprosecuting the war to a successful conclusion.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, all the Japanese garrisons in the Philippines were\r\nreinforced. The senior headquarters in the western Pacific was\r\ntransferred from Singapore to Manila, and the brigades in the Islands\r\nwere being developed to divisional strength. Of the estimated 180,000\r\ntroops, 80,000 were believed to be on Luzon, 50,000 in the Visayan\r\nIslands, and 50,000 on Mindanao. It was also believed that the enemy\r\nair strength on the Islands was being greatly increased. There were\r\n100 to 120 airfields in operation and between 700 and 1,500 aircraft,\r\nof which half were combat planes and the others training aircraft. [73]\r\n\r\nIn September 1944 Sixth Army G-2 estimated that the Japanese forces\r\non Leyte consisted mainly of 16th Division units and service troops--a\r\ntotal of 21,700 troops. The 35th Army had just been activated on Cebu\r\nand was to be charged with the defense of all the Visayan Islands. It\r\nwas estimated that the Leyte garrison consisted of the following\r\ncombat troops: 20th Infantry Regiment, 3,000; 33d Infantry Regiment,\r\n3,000; 16th Division Reconnaissance Regiment, 1,000; elements of\r\n102d Division, 1,700; 7th Independent Tank Company, 125; and 16th\r\nDivision Headquarters troops, 1,800. The total amounted to 10,625\r\nmen. In addition there were 1,000 base-defense troops and 10,075\r\nservice troops.\r\n\r\nIt was believed that the Japanese would commit one division on the day\r\nof the landing and the equivalent of another division, assembled from\r\nthe tactical reserves on the island, not later than three days after\r\nthe landing. For the next ten days, five to eight regiments might be\r\nsent in from neighboring islands. These would constitute the \"maximum\r\nnumbers of reinforcements predicated upon the existence of conditions\r\nmost favorable to the enemy.\" [74] The enemy had an undetermined\r\nnumber of tanks and armored cars. The only artillery known to be\r\navailable were some coastal defense guns emplaced along the east\r\ncoast and some artillery pieces on the hills overlooking Tacloban.\r\n\r\nSixth Army believed that on Leyte there were five operational\r\nairfields; three probably operational or under construction; seven\r\nnonoperational; and one seaplane base. The two most important\r\noperational airstrips were the one at Tacloban with forty-five\r\nhardstandings and the one at Dulag with twenty hardstandings. The\r\nTacloban airstrip could accommodate both bombers and fighters. At\r\nthe time of the invasion, it was estimated that the Japanese could\r\noppose the amphibious movement and the landing with 442 fighters and\r\n337 bombers from airfields scattered throughout the Philippines.\r\n\r\nAlthough the possibility existed that the Japanese Fleet, which was\r\nbased in waters near the home islands, might move to the Philippines,\r\nsuch a move was considered doubtful. It was believed that the principal\r\nand immediate threats consisted of a strong cruiser-destroyer task\r\nforce; submarines; and motor torpedo boats and similar craft.\r\n\r\nSixth Army concluded that the town of Tacloban, with its important\r\nport and airfield, was the key to the Japanese defense of the\r\nisland. Consequently, a strong perimeter defense of the town and\r\nthe surrounding area was expected. Since it was impossible for the\r\nJapanese, with a limited number of their troops on the island, to\r\ndefend all of the east coast, strong forces and emplaced defensive\r\npositions were likely to be concentrated at road junctions and at the\r\noperational airfields. Mobile reserves would almost certainly be held\r\nin readiness at key points in Leyte Valley, ready to be rushed to the\r\neast coast areas under attack. It was assumed that strong defenses\r\nwere already established in the Ormoc area and along the northeast\r\ncoast of Ormoc Bay, since the port of Ormoc could be used to bring in\r\nreserves from the other islands in the archipelago. A strong garrison\r\nwas expected at Carigara to protect the northern approaches to Leyte\r\nValley and to repel any amphibious landing through Carigara Bay.\r\n\r\nThe plan for the liberation of Leyte called for more men, guns, ships,\r\nand aircraft than had been required for any previous operation in the\r\nPacific. For the first time ground troops from the Central Pacific\r\nand Southwest Pacific were to join and fight the foe under a common\r\ncommander. General MacArthur, who had left Luzon in a motor torpedo\r\nboat, was to return to the Philippines with a vast armada--the greatest\r\nseen in the Pacific up to that time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tactical Plan\r\n\r\nThe Southwest Pacific Area was the command responsibility of General\r\nMacArthur. He had under his command Allied Air Forces, Lt. Gen. George\r\nC. Kenney commanding; Allied Naval Forces, Vice Adm. Thomas C. Kinkaid\r\ncommanding; Allied Land Forces, Gen. Sir Thomas Blamey commanding;\r\nUnited States Army Services of Supply (SWPA), Maj. Gen. James\r\nL. Frink commanding; and Alamo Force, which was virtually Sixth Army,\r\nLt. Gen. Walter Krueger commanding.\r\n\r\nOn 31 August 1944 General MacArthur issued his first formal\r\ndirective covering projected operations in the Philippines. The Leyte\r\noperation was known as King II. The Southwest Pacific forces were to\r\n\"seize objectives in the Mindanao, Leyte and Samar areas in order\r\nto establish air, naval and logistic bases to cover subsequent\r\noperations to complete the reoccupation of the Philippines.\" The\r\nassigned target dates were as follows: southern Mindanao, 15 November\r\n1944; northwestern Mindanao, 7 December; and Leyte Gulf-Surigao Strait\r\narea, 20 December. The Sixth Army, covered by Admiral Halsey's Third\r\nFleet and supported by the Allied Air and Naval Forces, was directed\r\nto carry out the three operations. [75] On 15 September General\r\nKrueger received word that the Talaud and Mindanao operations had\r\nbeen canceled and that the target date--designated as \"A Day\"--for\r\nthe Leyte operation had been advanced to 20 October. [76]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American Forces\r\n\r\nThe immediate task assigned the forces of the Southwest Pacific,\r\nsupported by the Third Fleet, was the seizure and control of the Leyte\r\nGulf-Surigao Strait area in order to establish air, naval, and logistic\r\nbases to support further operations into the Philippines. Before\r\nthe invasion, air and naval operations were to be conducted so as to\r\ndisorganize Japanese ground and air defenses. The ground operation was\r\ndivided into three phases. In the first phase overwater movement and\r\nminor amphibious operations to secure entrance into Leyte Gulf were\r\nto take place. The main effort, which constituted the second phase,\r\nwas to involve a major assault to capture the airfields and base sites\r\nin Leyte Valley and to open up San Juanico and Panaon Straits. In\r\nthe final phase, the remaining portions of the island in Japanese\r\nhands and the western part of southern Samar were to be secured,\r\nand Surigao Strait was to be opened. [77] The target date had been\r\nset for 20 October 1944.\r\n\r\nGeneral plans for the operation had long since been worked out,\r\nbut not until 20 September did General MacArthur issue his final\r\nplan for the occupation of Leyte. It was based upon the assumption\r\nthat American forces were or would be established along the\r\nMarianas-Ulithi-Palaus-Morotai line and that the Japanese land and\r\nair forces in the Philippines and Formosa would have been \"seriously\r\ncrippled and that the Japanese Fleet would elect to remain in Empire\r\nwaters\" with only \"light forces remaining in the vicinity of the\r\nPhilippines.\" The Japanese were expected to have one well-supplied\r\ndivision in the area with only limited ability to reinforce it from\r\nothers of the Visayan Islands and with all subsequent supply deliveries\r\ncut off. It was assumed that Japanese defenses would be concentrated\r\nin the vicinity of the airfields in the Leyte Valley and at Tacloban.\r\n\r\nThe command organization was as follows: General MacArthur was\r\nSupreme Commander, but during the amphibious movement and landing\r\nAdmiral Kinkaid, as commander of the Naval Attack Force, was to be\r\nin command of all amphibious operations. (Chart 1) Army officers,\r\nwho took control of their forces ashore, were to continue under the\r\nCommander, Naval Attack Force, until the next senior Army commander\r\nassumed control. Upon his arrival ashore and after notification to\r\nAdmiral Kinkaid, General Krueger was to take control of the ground\r\ntroops. General Kenney, as commander of the Allied Air Forces, would\r\nreport directly to General MacArthur.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Halsey, as commander of the Third Fleet, was to co-ordinate\r\nhis operations with those of General MacArthur but he was responsible\r\nto Admiral Nimitz, Commander in Chief, Pacific Ocean Area. The Third\r\nFleet was composed of Vice Adm. Marc Mitscher's Fast Carrier Task\r\nForce, together with miscellaneous elements. Mitscher's force was\r\ndivided into four carrier groups. [78]\r\n\r\nThe Allied Naval Forces, which consisted principally of the\r\nU. S. Seventh Fleet under Admiral Kinkaid, was to transport and\r\nestablish ashore the ground assault force. The Central Philippine\r\nAttack Force consisted of three task forces. Task Force 77, commanded\r\nby Admiral Kinkaid, was to furnish direct air and naval support and\r\nwas composed of battleships, light and heavy cruisers, destroyers,\r\ndestroyer escorts, carriers, escort carriers, gunboat and mortar\r\nflotillas, mine sweepers, auxiliary vessels, and underwater demolition\r\nteams. The transports and cargo ships of the Northern Attack Force,\r\nTask Force 78, under Rear Adm. Daniel E. Barbey, and the Southern\r\nAttack Force, Task Force 79, under Vice Adm. Theodore S. Wilkinson,\r\nwere to transport and set ashore the ground troops. Task Force 79\r\nhad been lent to General MacArthur by Admiral Nimitz for the operation.\r\n\r\nThe Allied Air Forces, principally the Far East Air Forces under\r\nGeneral Kenney, was to neutralize hostile air and naval forces\r\nwithin range of the Philippines. The Allied Air Forces consisted\r\nof the Fifth Air Force, commanded by Maj. Gen. Ennis P. Whitehead;\r\nthe Thirteenth Air Force, commanded by Maj. Gen. St. Clair Streett;\r\nthe Royal Australian Air Force Command under Air Vice Marshal William\r\nD. Bostock; and miscellaneous elements. On order, the Fifth Air Force\r\nwas to be prepared to take over the mission of furnishing direct air\r\nsupport to the ground troops.\r\n\r\nThe United States Army Services of Supply, Southwest Pacific Area,\r\ncommanded by General Frink, was to furnish logistic support for\r\nthe operation. The Eighth U.S. Army, commanded by Lt. Gen. Robert\r\nL. Eichelberger, and the Allied Land Forces, commanded by General\r\nBlamey, were to take over missions previously assigned the Sixth Army\r\nand to assist the latter in training, staging, and mounting the troops\r\nfor the Leyte operation.\r\n\r\nThe ground troops who were to attack Leyte constituted a field\r\narmy--the Sixth Army, which had fought its way up the New Guinea coast\r\nsince April 1943 as Alamo Force. On 25 September 1944 Alamo Force\r\nwas dissolved and Sixth Army assumed its tactical missions. General\r\nKrueger was commanding general for all these campaigns. The principal\r\ncomponent parts of Sixth Army were X and XXIV Corps. The former\r\nconsisted of the 1st Cavalry and 24th Infantry Divisions, under\r\nLt. Gen. Franklin C. Sibert, a seasoned commander who had successfully\r\nfought the Japanese on New Guinea at Wakde-Sarmi. The XXIV Corps,\r\nunder Maj. Gen. John R. Hodge, who had defeated the Japanese on\r\nGuadalcanal, New Georgia, and Bougainville, was composed of the\r\n7th and 96th Infantry Divisions. In reserve were the 32d and 77th\r\nInfantry Divisions. The Sixth Army Service Command was to perform\r\nengineer functions on the island and give general logistic support.\r\n\r\nApproximately 174,000 troops were made available for the initial\r\nassault phase of the operation. About 51,500 of these made up the XXIV\r\nCorps and 53,000 the X Corps. In addition to these troops, the reserve\r\n32d and 77th Divisions had a strength of about 14,500 and 14,000\r\ntroops, respectively. All of the assault divisions were reinforced\r\nwith tank battalions, amphibian truck and tractor battalions, joint\r\nassault signal companies, and many attached service units. A total of\r\nabout 202,500 ground troops was committed to the Leyte operation. [79]\r\n\r\nHeadquarters, Sixth Army, had never participated as such in any\r\ncampaign, but as Headquarters, Alamo Force, it had directed the\r\noperations up the New Guinea coast. Both the X and XXIV Corps were\r\nyet to be battle tested, though all their divisions with one exception\r\nhad participated in previous campaigns against the Japanese. The 1st\r\nCavalry Division had taken part in the Admiralty Islands campaign;\r\nthe 7th Division had defeated the Japanese at Attu and Kwajalein;\r\nthe 24th Division had fought in the Hollandia campaign; the 32d\r\nDivision had won the Papua Campaign and been victorious at Aitape\r\non New Guinea; and the 77th Division had shared in the victory at\r\nGuam. Only the 96th Division was yet to be combat tested. [80]\r\n\r\nGeneral MacArthur's Warning Instructions 5 and Operations Instructions\r\n70 were used by each of the major commanders as a basis for his own\r\noperations orders. Although each order was derived from the one\r\nnext above it, all were planned concurrently. There was need for\r\nconstant intertheater, interservice, and intraservice conferences and\r\ndiscussions on all phases of the plans as they evolved. Frequently\r\nthe planning was made easier by using the work done on plans for\r\nother operations. For example, the logistical plan for the canceled\r\nYap operation was adapted with very little change to the Leyte\r\noperation. The general schemes of maneuver and the employment of\r\nsupport forces which had been found valuable in previous operations\r\nwere also adapted with minor variations to the plans for Leyte.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAir Support\r\n\r\nThe Navy was to bear the brunt of furnishing air support in the early\r\nstages of the campaign. By arrangement with Admiral Nimitz, the Carrier\r\nTask Force from Admiral Halsey's Third Fleet was to strike northern\r\nLuzon and Okinawa or Formosa, or both, from A Day minus 10 to A minus\r\n7. From A minus 4 through A Day, strikes were to be made on Luzon, the\r\nCebu-Negros area, and the Leyte area in support of the landings. As\r\nsoon as the Palau air base facilities would permit, shore-based air\r\nforces from the Central Pacific were to operate in the Bicol area. [81]\r\n\r\nThe Allied Naval Forces was to furnish carrier aircraft as protection\r\nfor convoys and naval task forces and, supplemented by aircraft of\r\nthe Third Fleet and the Allied Air Forces, to provide direct air\r\nsupport for the landings. In addition, it was to furnish protective\r\nair support and cover by carrier aircraft prior to A Day for the\r\npreliminary landings in Leyte Gulf and for the mine sweeping. [82]\r\n\r\nGeneral Mac Arthur assigned air support missions to the Allied Air\r\nForces. General Kenney's airmen were (1) to make aerial reconnaissance;\r\n(2) in co-ordination with Third Fleet carrier-based aircraft, to\r\nneutralize hostile naval and air forces within range of the Philippines\r\nfrom A minus 9 in order to cover the movement of naval forces, the\r\nlanding, and subsequent operations; (3) within capabilities and when\r\nrequested by Admiral Kinkaid, to protect convoys and naval forces and\r\nprovide direct support of the landings and subsequent operations;\r\nand (4) to destroy Japanese shipping and installations in the Sulu\r\nand Arafura Seas and the East Indies. [83]\r\n\r\nOn 24 September General Kenney issued his order for the Leyte operation\r\nand assigned missions to the Allied Air Forces. He designated General\r\nWhitehead's Fifth Air Force as the Air Assault Force. It was to\r\nsupport the operation by intensified air activities against enemy\r\ninstallations, destroy hostile air and surface forces in the Celebes\r\nSea and assigned areas in the Philippine Archipelago, and provide\r\nair defense for existing bases and forces in transit to Leyte within\r\nrange of its capabilities. It was also to be prepared to establish,\r\non order, land-based air forces on Leyte. The Thirteenth Air Force\r\nwas to support the missions of the Fifth Air Force, while the Royal\r\nAustralian Air Force Command was to destroy Japanese installations\r\nand sources of raw materials in the Netherlands Indies. [84]\r\n\r\nAircraft from other theaters agreed to aid in the operation. The\r\nFourteenth Air Force from the China-Burma-India Theater and the\r\nTwentieth Air Force from the Central Pacific were to conduct strikes\r\nagainst Formosa. The Southeast Asia Command was asked to schedule\r\nair offensives against Burma and Malaya just prior to A Day. [85]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNaval Support\r\n\r\nThe Seventh Fleet under Admiral Kinkaid was assigned the following\r\nmission: \"by a ship to shore amphibious operation, [to] transport,\r\nprotect, land and support elements of the 6th Army in order to assist\r\nin the seizure, occupation and development of the Leyte area of the\r\nSouthern Philippines.\" [86] (Chart 2)\r\n\r\nThe Seventh Fleet was designated the Naval Attack Force. For the\r\noperation Admiral Kinkaid organized two attack forces: the Northern\r\nAttack Force (VII Amphibious Force), under Admiral Barbey, and\r\nthe Southern Attack Force (III Amphibious Force), under Admiral\r\nWilkinson. In addition, several subordinate units were created: a\r\nbombardment and fire support group under Rear Adm. Jesse B. Oldendorf;\r\nand a close covering group, an escort carrier group, a mine-sweeping\r\ngroup, and twelve underwater demolition teams. The Northern Attack\r\nForce was to transport and land the X Corps, while the Southern Attack\r\nForce was to do the same for the XXIV Corps.\r\n\r\nThe task groups of the two attack forces were to sortie from the\r\nmounting areas at Manus in the Admiralties and Hollandia in Netherlands\r\nNew Guinea and rendezvous en route to the objective area. Both were\r\n\"to land main elements as nearly simultaneously as practicable at H\r\nHour on 20 October.\" Meanwhile, an advance group on 17 October was\r\nto land the 6th Ranger Infantry Battalion on the islands guarding the\r\napproaches to Leyte Gulf. The task groups were to regulate their speed\r\nof advance so that they would arrive at the entrance of the approach\r\nchannel to Leyte Gulf at specified times. The mine-sweeping group and\r\ncertain units of the bombardment and fire support group which were\r\nto render fire support for initial mine-sweeping operations were to\r\narrive at 0600 on 17 October. They were to be followed fifteen minutes\r\nlater by the attack group assigned to the island approaches. At 1000\r\non the same day the rest of the bombardment and fire support group\r\nwere to arrive. Beginning at 2300 on 19 October the transports and\r\nLST's of the two attack forces were scheduled to arrive in successive\r\ngroups. Their time of arrival was also set so that each group would\r\nreach its transport area in sufficient time to dispatch the assault\r\nwaves to the beach at the designated hour. [87]\r\n\r\nOn arrival in the objective area, the bombardment and fire support\r\ngroup was to divide into northern and southern fire support units,\r\nwhich were then to move to their respective target areas. The northern\r\nfire support unit consisted of 3 old battleships--the Mississippi,\r\nMaryland, and West Virginia--and 3 destroyers. The southern fire\r\nsupport unit was composed of 3 battleships--the Tennessee, California,\r\nand Pennsylvania--13 destroyers, 3 light cruisers, 3 heavy cruisers,\r\nand 1 small seaplane tender.\r\n\r\nThe destroyers in the two target areas were to furnish protection to\r\nthe mine sweepers and the underwater demolition teams. The latter were\r\nto cover the northern and southern beaches before A Day and search\r\nout and destroy any obstacles, either Japanese-made or natural, in\r\nthe waters surrounding the landing beach areas. The mine sweepers\r\nwere to start clearing Leyte Gulf of fixed or floating mines on 17\r\nOctober, three days before the main assault. On the following days,\r\nincluding 20 October, they were to make more intensive sweeps of the\r\nchannels and landing beach areas, with the vessels going as close to\r\nshore as possible without endangering gear. [88]\r\n\r\nAdmiral Oldendorf was to direct the bombardment and fire support. The\r\nbombardment was to start on 17 October in preparation for the\r\nlandings on the island approaches. The gunfire before 20 October\r\nwas for the purpose of rendering unserviceable both airfields and\r\nJapanese aircraft on the ground, in addition to destroying guns and\r\nemplacements, fuel storage and ammunition dumps, naval forces and\r\nshipping, beach defenses and strong points, troops, torpedo launching\r\nramps, and torpedo barges. Close fire support was to be given to the\r\nunderwater demolition teams and destructive fire was to be delivered\r\nagainst enemy forces attempting overwater movements. Finally, night\r\nharassing fire was scheduled to prevent any night attempts of the\r\nJapanese to reconstruct the fortifications and airfields.\r\n\r\nOn 20 October the naval gunfire support units were to cover the\r\napproach of the transports to the unloading areas and to furnish\r\nnecessary counterbattery fire; thoroughly cover the landing beach\r\nareas from the low-water line to approximately 400 yards inland;\r\nand closely support the landings with rockets, 4.2-inch mortars, and\r\ngunfire of all caliber from the ships. After the landings, the naval\r\ngunfire units were to deliver fire on call and prevent the Japanese\r\nfrom either reinforcing or evacuating the island. [89]\r\n\r\nThe Joint Chiefs of Staff had directed Admiral Nimitz to support\r\nGeneral MacArthur's operation against Leyte. Admiral Nimitz ordered\r\nAdmiral Halsey's Third Fleet to \"destroy enemy naval and air forces\r\nin or threatening the Philippine Area.\" The Third Fleet was also to\r\nprotect the air and sea communications along the Central Philippines\r\naxis. If an opportunity to destroy major portions of the Japanese\r\nFleet should arise or could be created, such destruction was to be the\r\nprimary task of all naval forces from the Central Pacific. Admiral\r\nHalsey and General MacArthur were to arrange the necessary measures\r\nfor the co-ordination of their operations. [90]\r\n\r\nIn support of the Leyte operation the Third Fleet was to contain\r\nor destroy the Japanese Fleet and to destroy enemy aircraft and\r\nshipping in the Formosa, Luzon, Visayan, and Mindanao areas from 9\r\nOctober through 17 October, and from A Day for as long as necessary\r\nduring the next thirty days, in order to \"maintain their continued\r\nneutralization.\" From 18 October until such time as the escort carriers\r\ncould assume direct support, the Third Fleet was to destroy enemy\r\nground defenses and installations in Leyte and adjacent areas. Finally,\r\nthe Third Fleet was to provide direct support by fast carrier aircraft\r\nfor the landing and subsequent operations. [91]\r\n\r\nSubmarines from both the Southwest Pacific and Central Pacific were to\r\nsupport the operations by maintaining an offensive reconnaissance over\r\nthe most probable Japanese route of advance, maintaining observation\r\nand lifeguard services and furnishing weather reports and strategic\r\npatrols. Submarines from the Central Pacific were to patrol in the\r\nFormosa, Luzon, Tokyo Bay, and Sasebo areas, while those from the\r\nSeventh Fleet patrolled in the area of Makassar Strait, the Celebes\r\nSea, and the Sulu Sea. Submarines from both areas were to maintain\r\na strong patrol in the Hainan--northern Luzon areas. [92]\r\n\r\nThe naval gunfire, the air support, and the artillery fire were to\r\nbe carefully co-ordinated. At every level from battalion to army\r\nrepresentatives from each support arm were to co-ordinate the use\r\nof their support arms against targets in their respective zones\r\nof action. Requests for support were to be screened as they passed\r\nthrough the various echelons for approval. Commanders in the field\r\nfelt that the passage of requests through many channels was time\r\nconsuming and consequently sometimes nullified what might have been\r\nan immediate advantage. However, requests for support were usually\r\nacted upon within an hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ground Forces\r\n\r\nThe ground forces designated for the Leyte operation came from two\r\ndifferent theaters--the X Corps from the Southwest Pacific and the XXIV\r\nCorps from the Central Pacific. The XXIV Corps, originally intended\r\nfor the Yap operation, had been substituted for the XIV Corps,\r\noriginally intended for Leyte. As the new assignment of the XXIV\r\nCorps placed it under the operational control of General MacArthur,\r\nit was necessary that agreements on the co-ordination of operations\r\nbe reached by the commanders in chief of the two areas. The XXIV\r\nCorps, with its original shipping, had been turned over to General\r\nMacArthur. During the combat phase at Leyte, General MacArthur was to\r\nfurnish the replacements required by the XXIV Corps, but subsequent\r\nreplacements were to be supplied by Admiral Nimitz. [93]\r\n\r\nThe initial assault for the island of Leyte was to begin in the dim\r\nhalf dawn of 17 October, when elements of the 6th Ranger Infantry\r\nBattalion were to land under the protection of naval gunfire and seize\r\nthe small islands that guarded the entrance to Leyte Gulf. (Map 3)\r\nHarbor lights were to be placed on Homonhon Island and the northern\r\ntip of Dinagat Island in order to guide the passage of the convoy into\r\nthe gulf. Since it was believed that there were valuable mine charts\r\non Suluan, that island was added to the objectives of the 6th Rangers.\r\n\r\nGeneral Krueger had wanted to use either the reinforced 158th Infantry\r\nRegiment or the reinforced 112th Cavalry Regimental Combat Team\r\nto secure the island approaches to Leyte Gulf and the Panaon Strait\r\narea. The 21st Infantry, which was assigned the mission of securing the\r\nPanaon Strait area, then could have remained with the 24th Division,\r\nits parent unit, and the 6th Ranger Battalion could have been used\r\nwherever and whenever needed. In addition, these missions would have\r\nbeen put in the hands of a general officer who had an experienced\r\nstaff to assist him. Neither of the desired regiments, however,\r\ncould be made available for the Leyte operation because of shortage\r\nof troops and previous commitments. [94]\r\n\r\nWhile the Rangers were seizing the small islands, the mine sweepers\r\nand underwater demolition teams were to start clearing the gulf of\r\nnatural and man-made obstacles. The fire support units were to move in\r\nand start softening up the beaches. The completion of these missions\r\nwould conclude the first phase of the operation.\r\n\r\nThe second phase comprised \"a major amphibious assault to attack and\r\ndestroy hostile forces in the coastal strip Tacloban-Dulag inclusive,\r\nand to seize airdromes and base sites therein; a rapid advance through\r\nLeyte Valley to seize and occupy the Capoocan-Carigara-Barugo area;\r\n[and finally] open San Juanico and Panaon Straits....\" [95]\r\n\r\nIn the very early hours of 20 October the Northern and Southern Attack\r\nForces were to move to their appointed beach areas and be prepared\r\nto disembark their assault troops. The reinforced 21st Infantry\r\nRegiment was to go ashore at 0930 in the vicinity of Panaon Strait\r\nat the extreme southeast tip of Leyte and secure control of that\r\nentrance to Sogod Bay. To the north at 1000, the X Corps was to land\r\nwith two divisions abreast in the Marasbaras and Palo areas. About\r\nfifteen miles farther south, in the Dulag area, the XXIV Corps was to\r\ngo ashore simultaneously with two divisions abreast. The two corps\r\nwould be so widely separated and their objectives so divergent that\r\ninitially they could not be mutually supporting. Even within the zones\r\nof action of the two corps, the missions assigned the divisions would\r\nlimit the ability of the divisions to support each other. [96]\r\n\r\nAs General Krueger felt that the Japanese would offer the greatest\r\nresistance in the north, the initial objectives of the X Corps were\r\nlimited to the seizure of Palo and the capture of Tacloban and its\r\nairfield. The northernmost unit, the 1st Cavalry Division, actually\r\nan infantry square division, was to land with brigades abreast in\r\nthe Marasbaras area, advance to the north, and seize Tacloban and\r\nits airstrip, the most important objective for A Day. Thereafter,\r\nthe division was to secure control over San Juanico Strait. To the\r\nleft of the 1st Cavalry Division, the 24th Division was to go ashore\r\nwith regiments abreast in the Palo area, seize Palo, and then advance\r\nnorthwest through the Leyte Valley. The two divisions were to converge\r\non Carigara, at the northern end of Leyte Valley on Carigara Bay. [97]\r\n\r\nIn the XXIV Corps zone, the 96th Division with regiments abreast\r\nwas to land in the area between Dulag and San Roque, and to secure\r\nthat portion of Highway 1 in its zone, Catmon Hill, and, finally,\r\nthe Dagami-Tanauan area. On its left the 7th Division with regiments\r\nabreast was to go ashore in the Dulag area. One element was to go\r\nsouth and seize the Highway 1 bridge and crossings of the Daguitan\r\n(Marabang) River at Dao while the main force of the division was\r\nto advance along the axis of the Dulag-Burauen road and capture\r\nBurauen. The 7th Division would then be in a position to move north\r\ntoward Dagami. All hostile airfields in its zone of action were to\r\nbe seized and occupied. The division was to be prepared, on corps\r\norder, to seize Abuyog, to the south, and Baybay, on the west coast,\r\ndestroying enemy forces on the west coast and in the southern portion\r\nof Leyte. [98]\r\n\r\nCompletion of these missions of the X and XXIV Corps would bring\r\nto an end the second phase of the Leyte operation. By this time,\r\nGeneral Krueger hoped, the back of the Japanese resistance would be\r\nbroken. With Leyte Valley and its airfields and base sites firmly\r\nin the hands of the Sixth Army, General Krueger's forces would be in\r\na position to apply firmly the pincers on the remaining Japanese on\r\nthe island. The X Corps was to drive south down the Ormoc Valley to\r\nOrmoc while the XXIV Corps was to move north from Baybay along the\r\nshores of Ormoc Bay and make juncture with the X Corps. The remnants\r\nof the Japanese forces, driven into the mountains of western Leyte,\r\nwould be unable to continue an organized resistance. [99]\r\n\r\nThe eastern shores of Leyte were chosen for the initial landing,\r\nsince the beaches on this side were the best on the island, and\r\nwere the logical entrance to the important airfields, base sites,\r\nand roads in Leyte Valley.\r\n\r\nSince the large number of naval vessels required considerable room\r\nfor landing the assault troops and for maneuvering, the landing beach\r\nareas of the two corps were widely separated. In addition, the value of\r\nthe road net which connected Dulag with the Burauen airfields formed\r\nan important consideration in the determination of the landing beach\r\nsites of the XXIV Corps. \"This latter factor--which took precedence\r\nover the potentiality of strong enemy resistance from Catmon Hill--had\r\ndetermined the selection of beaches in the Dulag area.\" [100]\r\n\r\nAlthough it was recognized as necessary for elements of the XXIV Corps\r\nto advance south to Abuyog and then overland to Baybay in order to\r\ndestroy the enemy forces on the west coast, these maneuvers would\r\nleave great gaps in the battle line if only four divisions were at\r\nfirst employed. General Krueger therefore asked General Headquarters\r\nof the Southwest Pacific for additional combat troops, and during the\r\nprogress of the campaign General MacArthur made them available. [101]\r\n\r\nThe Sixth Army was also troubled about its reserve force. Although the\r\n32d Division at Morotai and Hollandia and the 77th Division at Guam had\r\nbeen designated as Sixth Army Reserve, it would be impossible for these\r\nunits to arrive at Leyte before the middle of November. The shortage\r\nof amphibious shipping made it necessary to mount these divisions on\r\nthe turnaround of assault shipping. Since the floating reserve would\r\nhave to come from one of the assault divisions, it was difficult to\r\ndetermine from which division to take it. It was decided that the\r\n96th Division, considering its mission, could best spare such a unit,\r\nand the 381st Infantry of that division was therefore selected. [102]\r\n\r\nTo summarize the mission of the Sixth Army: on 17 October, the 6th\r\nRanger Infantry Battalion would seize Suluan, Dinagat, and Homonhon\r\nIslands, in the entrance to Leyte Bay. At 0930 on 20 October, the 21st\r\nInfantry Regiment was to land in the vicinity of Panaon Strait and\r\nsecure control of that entrance to Sogod Bay. At 1000 on the same day\r\nthe Sixth Army with the X and XXIV Corps abreast would make a major\r\namphibious landing on Leyte. In the north the X Corps, with the 1st\r\nCavalry Division and the 24th Infantry Division abreast, after moving\r\nashore in the Marasbaras and the Palo areas, would capture Tacloban,\r\nits airfield, and Palo. In the south the XXIV Corps with the 96th and\r\n7th Infantry Divisions abreast would go ashore to secure control in\r\nthe Dulag area. [103]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Logistical Plan\r\n\r\nConstruction\r\n\r\nThe decision to land on Leyte at the beginning of the rainy season\r\nand to construct a major supply and air base thereon presented a\r\nserious problem to the engineers. The poor soil, inadequate roads,\r\nand heavy rains were obstacles that had to be met and in some way\r\novercome if the operation was to be a logistical success. General\r\nMacArthur recognized the need for making use of Leyte as a logistical\r\nbase by creating for the first time in the Southwest Pacific an army\r\nservice command and by detailing his chief engineer, Maj. Gen. Hugh\r\nJ. Casey, to be its commander. ASCOM, as it was called, was to provide\r\nthe logistical services required for the operation and to build and\r\noperate the Army base facilities until the United States Army Services\r\nof Supply (SWPA) could take over. This transfer was expected to take\r\nplace about thirty days after the assault troops first landed on the\r\nshores of Leyte. [104]\r\n\r\nGeneral Mac Arthur directed the Sixth Army to establish the following\r\nair facilities in the Leyte area: by A plus 5, facilities for two\r\nfighter groups, one night fighter squadron, one photo squadron, one\r\nmedium bomber group plus one squadron, three patrol bomber squadrons,\r\nand one Marine reconnaissance squadron; by A plus 30, additional\r\nfacilities for two light bomber groups, one air-sea rescue squadron,\r\none tactical reconnaissance squadron, and one fighter squadron;\r\nadditional facilities by A plus 45 for one fighter group, one patrol\r\nbomber squadron, two heavy bomber groups, and one laboratory squadron;\r\nand by A plus 60, further facilities for one photo squadron, one\r\npatrol bomber squadron, two troop carrier groups, and one combat\r\nmapping squadron. [105]\r\n\r\nThe final Sixth Army plan for the Leyte operation directed ASCOM\r\nto establish naval facilities in the Leyte area as well as the\r\naforementioned air facilities; to make topographic and hydrographic\r\nsurveys, followed by suitable changes in the plans for the construction\r\nof bases, docks, roads, and airdromes; to unload all units, supplies,\r\nand matériel arriving in the area and to store and issue supplies to\r\nground and air units; and, in co-operation with the Philippine Civil\r\nAffairs Units, recruit and direct native labor. [106]\r\n\r\nThe construction program as planned for Leyte brought strong\r\nremonstrances from the Sixth Army engineers. On 10 August Col. William\r\nJ. Ely, the executive officer, protested against the employment\r\nof Leyte as a major supply and air force base. The reasons for his\r\nobjections were prophetic. The operation was to be launched during\r\nthe season of heavy rains in an area where high winds and typhoons\r\noccurred. The harbor was so shallow and so obstructed by patches\r\nof coral that the approaches would have to be as much as 800 feet\r\nlong. The fact that the flat Leyte Valley was interlaced by many\r\nstreams and flooded with rice paddies indicated that the soil was\r\n\"most unstable.\" The condition of the soil and drainage would require\r\nthe hauling, frequently for long distances, of considerable quantities\r\nof rock for the construction of roads. The existing roads and bridges,\r\nin most places so narrow as to permit only one-way traffic, would\r\nsoon disintegrate under the constant heavy rains and the pounding\r\nof military vehicles. Colonel Ely forecast that, in the light\r\nof past experience with poor conditions of soil and drainage, the\r\nconstruction and enlargement of the airstrips would be difficult. The\r\nshortage of engineer troops decreased the possibility of providing\r\nmajor air and supply bases in sufficient time to properly support\r\nfurther operations. He concluded that \"the construction mission\r\ncannot be satisfactorily accomplished with the engineer troops\r\navailable, particularly during the first 90 days.\" Colonel Ely\r\ngloomily summarized, \"Perhaps we can mud and muddle through again on\r\na shoestring but the shoestring must be frayed by this time and if\r\nit broke we may lose our shirt as well as our shoe.\"\r\n\r\nIf the strategic plan were fixed, he recommended that one or more of\r\nthe following measures be adopted: (1) increase the number of engineer\r\nconstruction troops; (2) shift the operation to an area where major\r\nair and supply bases could be constructed without encountering the\r\nadverse weather and port conditions existing on Leyte; (3) \"decrease\r\nthe tempo of the strategic plan\"; and finally (4) decrease the scope\r\nof the air and supply requirements. Nothing was to be gained \"by\r\nundertaking an overambitious program from the beginning that cannot\r\nbe completed on a time schedule that will assure early and adequate\r\nsupport to future operations.\" [107]\r\n\r\nCol. Samuel D. Sturgis, Jr., Sixth Army Engineer, forwarded Colonel\r\nEly's report with a strong concurrence to General MacArthur's engineer,\r\nbut General Headquarters decided to proceed with the original\r\nlogistical plans for the operation. [108]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSupplies\r\n\r\nThe supplies required for the operation involved staggering\r\nquantities. For an invasion force of 150,000 men, the War Department\r\nfigures showed that, for the landing period alone, 1,500,000 tons\r\nof general equipment, 235,000 tons of combat vehicles, 200,000\r\ntons of ammunition, and 200,000 tons of medical supplies were\r\nrequired. Thereafter, 332,000 tons of equipment would be required\r\nevery thirty days. [109] According to the final plan, issued by\r\nGeneral Krueger on 30 September 1944, [110] the units of the Sixth\r\nArmy, X Corps, and Sixth Army Service Command, under General Casey,\r\nwhich were to arrive at Leyte between 20 and 30 October were to take\r\nashore a minimum of ten days' supply of all classes (except engineer\r\nsupplies, which were to be for at least thirty days), and two units\r\nof fire. [111] In this way the strain on ASCOM supply units would be\r\nlessened, and ASCOM, it was hoped, would have time to establish dumps\r\nand make the necessary supply installations. In addition to supplies\r\naccompanying the assault troops, sufficient quantities were to be\r\nbrought into Leyte by 30 October to bring the total supplies for the\r\ntroops to the following figures, expressed in days: thirty days of\r\nfood, clothing, and equipment; fifteen days of motor transport fuel\r\nand distillate; and thirty days of other petroleum products. There were\r\nalso to be five units of fire for combat troops and three for service\r\ntroops. The original plan had called for a thirty-day supply of all\r\npetroleum products to be brought in by A plus 10, but this quantity\r\nwas reduced when General Krueger adopted a plan for the installation\r\nby A plus 7 of bulk fuel storage. The XXIV Corps supply levels were to\r\nremain the same as those planned for the now-canceled Yap operation,\r\nsince the corps was already loaded with supplies which were considered\r\nadequate for the Leyte invasion. [112]\r\n\r\nThere were certain differences in the loads carried by the X and the\r\nXXIV Corps. The XXIV Corps embarked with a thirty-day supply of rations\r\nand medical supplies, twenty days of clothing, weapons, vehicles,\r\nfuels, lubricants, construction matériel, and seven units of fire for\r\nall artillery and five units for other types of weapons. Since the type\r\nof equipment loaded had been selected for the Yap operation, amphibian\r\nvehicles were favored over wheeled vehicles. Less than 50 percent of\r\nthe Table of Equipment allowance of general purpose vehicles and dump\r\ntrucks accompanied the units. Furthermore, many badly needed items\r\nof organizational equipment were carried by the rear echelons, which\r\ndid not arrive until January 1945, after Leyte had been secured. [113]\r\n\r\nThe supplies which were to accompany the troops during the initial\r\nphases of the Leyte operation were to come from bases in New Guinea\r\nand the Central Pacific. Resupply shipping--to be called for as\r\nneeded--was to be loaded at bases in the United States, Australia, and,\r\nif necessary, New Guinea. [114] In addition, ten loaded liberty ships\r\nwere to be held in floating reserve, eight at Hollandia and two in the\r\nPalaus. Two of these were loaded with aviation gasoline, two with fuel\r\noil and lubricants, two with ammunition for the air forces and four\r\nwith ammunition for the ground forces. Admiral Nimitz was to furnish\r\ntwo of the four last mentioned. Except for the LST's transporting\r\nthe XXIV Corps, each LST arriving on 20 October was to carry thirty\r\ntons of technical supplies for the air forces. All LST's arriving\r\nfrom A plus 1 through A plus 4 were to carry forty tons of similar\r\nsupplies. [115] General MacArthur charged the Commanding General,\r\nUnited States Army Services of Supply (SWPA), with providing the\r\nSixth Army with all supplies, except air force technical supplies,\r\nthat would be needed for the operation. [116]\r\n\r\nAn Army garrison force for Yap under Maj. Gen. Roscoe B. Woodruff\r\nhad been scheduled to go with the XXIV Corps, and at Admiral Nimitz'\r\nsuggestion this force was designated to accompany the corps to the\r\nnew target, Leyte, though the Southwest Pacific Area had never\r\nused an organization of this type. [117] It was hoped that the\r\nforce might be useful in taking over \"house-keeping\" duties and the\r\ndevelopment of rear areas, thus relieving the assault commander of\r\nthose responsibilities. Incidentally, General Krueger made little\r\nuse of the garrison force. Units which furnished logistic support\r\nfor carrier operations were also included and were to be assigned to\r\nthe Seventh Fleet. Admiral Nimitz was to continue furnishing logistic\r\nsupport to the XXIV Corps until relieved by General MacArthur. [118]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShipping\r\n\r\nOn 21 September, Pacific Ocean Areas and Southwest Pacific Area reached\r\nan agreement on resupply of ammunition for the XXIV Corps. Arrangements\r\nwere made for loaded ships from San Francisco to be sent to the Leyte\r\narea periodically to alleviate the shipping shortage. [119] It was\r\nexpected that at least twenty-two cargo ships would so arrive from\r\nSan Francisco during the operation.\r\n\r\nThe change in target dates and the substitution of the XXIV Corps for\r\nthe XIV Corps reduced the amount of amphibious shipping available for\r\nthe Leyte operation. Consequently representatives of the Sixth Army,\r\nthe VII Amphibious Force, and the Fifth Air Force met at General\r\nKrueger's headquarters to work out the details for a new shipping\r\nschedule. They made minor changes in the dates for the movement of\r\nconvoys, and rearranged echelons, eliminating one. [120] The shipping\r\nfor the XXIV Corps and the ten resupply ships were to remain the same\r\nas planned for Yap. [121]\r\n\r\nThe amphibious shipping allocated to MacArthur was to be made available\r\nfor such turnaround shipping as would be required. The date of release\r\nof the amphibious vessels in order to mount subsequent operations would\r\nbe announced later, but none were to be released for return to Nimitz'\r\ncontrol without permission from MacArthur. An additional division\r\nlift, which was not included, was to return the 77th Division from\r\nGuam to Guadalcanal or to a location indicated by Admiral Nimitz. [122]\r\n\r\nOn 25 September Sixth Army submitted to General Headquarters a schedule\r\nof cargo loadings of heavy shipping for the Leyte operation and made\r\nsuggestions as to heavy shipping for direct movement of troops. All\r\ntroops and supply ships with the assault convoy which were to depart\r\nfrom Hollandia must arrive in that area not later than A minus 9. [123]\r\n\r\nThe shipping instructions specified that the ships were to be loaded\r\nfor selective discharge; all resupply ships transporting rations,\r\nclothing, vehicles, weapons, and ammunition would be duplicate loaded;\r\nloaded floating reserve ships would be provided; medical supplies would\r\nbe top loaded to avoid breakage and damage; and sufficient stevedore\r\ngear would be placed aboard each ship to handle its cargo. On 25 and\r\n26 September General Krueger's transportation officer submitted to\r\nGeneral Headquarters the heavy shipping requirements for the overwater\r\nmovement of cargo and troops, respectively. It was considered necessary\r\nto utilize \"all types of shipping from Navy LSM's, LST's, and assault\r\ntransports to army controlled merchant ships and troop carriers.\" [124]\r\nAdditional shipping was obtained by making use of that which had\r\ncarried the 1st Marine Division and the 81st Division to Peleliu and\r\nAngaur in the Palau Islands. [125] The shipping specified above was\r\nassembled at Manus and Hollandia and was assigned to the 1st Cavalry\r\nDivision and the 24th Division, which were embarking, respectively,\r\nat those two ports. The XXIV Corps, after leaving the Hawaiian Islands,\r\nwas brought to Manus where it remained in its original shipping.\r\n\r\nOn 8 October General Krueger asked the commanding generals of X\r\nCorps, XXIV Corps, and ASCOM, together with the commanding officers\r\nof the 6th Ranger Infantry Battalion and the 21st Infantry Regiment,\r\nwhether they would be able to meet the target date for Leyte. [126]\r\nUpon receiving affirmative replies, he laconically informed General\r\nHeadquarters: \"Sixth Army Forces designated for KING TWO Operations\r\nare ready to meet KING TWO Target Date.\" [127]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nThe Return\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more than two years the high command of the Southwest Pacific had\r\nanticipated the promised return to the Philippines. That objective\r\nhad governed nearly all of the planning and most of the earlier\r\ninvasions. Now the day had arrived. Plans had been made and troops\r\nand cargo were aboard ships. The fleets of the Pacific Ocean Areas\r\nand the Southwest Pacific Area were about to join forces in a mighty\r\nassault against the Philippines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Convoy Forms\r\n\r\nThat part of the VII Amphibious Force which carried the 24th Infantry\r\nDivision and the Sixth Army Service Command assembled at the harbor\r\nof Hollandia, Netherlands New Guinea. In this force were over 470\r\nships, ranging in size from small rocket-launching craft to 5,000-man\r\ntroopships, loaded and now waiting for the message to weigh anchor\r\nand head for the Far Shore, as Leyte was designated. They were\r\nscheduled to pick up that part of the force which was carrying the\r\n1st Cavalry Division from Manus Island and then rendezvous with the\r\nIII Amphibious Force.\r\n\r\nAt 1600 on Friday, the thirteenth of October, the word was given and\r\nthe great fleet at Hollandia got under way for the target--Leyte--1,300\r\nmiles distant. [128] Minesweeping task groups had preceded it on\r\n11 and 12 October. [129] By sundown the convoy was formed and the\r\nships were darkened. On 14 October the ships of the convoy crossed\r\nthe equator without ceremony. General quarters (battle drill) and\r\nabandon ship drills were held. The part of the force carrying the 1st\r\nCavalry Division was sighted during the day. On the following day the\r\ntwo units joined and the convoy proceeded. On 17 October the convoy\r\nmade visual contact with the tractor groups of the III Amphibious\r\nForce. This force had come from Hawaii with the XXIV Corps to help\r\nin the liberation of Leyte. [130]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV Corps Afloat\r\n\r\nIn the early morning hours of 13 September the headquarters\r\nof XXIV Corps at Schofield Barracks, Oahu, Hawaii, was awake and\r\nactive. Breakfast was served at 0330, and all men who had been informed\r\nthe day before that they were to embark for an unknown shore shouldered\r\ntheir barracks bags and carried them to waiting trucks. By 0700 the\r\nmen had been loaded on the trucks, which took them to the narrow-gauge\r\nOahu railroad. In flat cars they traveled some twenty miles to Honolulu\r\nHarbor. The usual seeming delays followed, but eventually the hot,\r\ntired, and perspiring headquarters men boarded the George F. Clymer\r\nand were assigned bunks. The Clymer was but one unit of a large convoy\r\nthat stretched toward the horizon in every direction. At 1115 on 15\r\nSeptember the convoy got under way for a destination believed to be\r\nYap. As the ships departed, word was received that the Yap operation\r\nhad been canceled and that Leyte was to be their destination. For\r\nthe men on board, life fell into the monotonous routine common to\r\nall transports. Reading, card and dice games, eating, sleeping,\r\nand interminable \"bull sessions\" helped to pass the time.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of the month the Clymer anchored at Eniwetok Island,\r\nan anchorage already crowded with hundreds of transports, warships,\r\nand cargo vessels. The men were allowed to go ashore, where they were\r\ngiven beer and other refreshments. The XXIV Corps was notified that\r\nit would leave for Manus, in the Admiralty Islands, where further\r\norders would be received and the staging completed. The LST flotilla\r\nleft on 26 September and two days later the transports followed. Maps,\r\nterrain studies, and aerial photographs were distributed and studied\r\nen route. [131] At the same time the XXIV Corps issued a tentative\r\nfield order which was distributed to lower unit commanders, who then\r\nheld conferences and issued tentative verbal field orders. [132]\r\n\r\nEarly in October the convoy crossed the equator. On many of the ships\r\nceremonies were held transforming pollywogs into shellbacks, with the\r\nresult that some of the men preferred standing to sitting for a few\r\ndays. On 3 October the convoy arrived at Manus. [133] The assault\r\ntroops of the XXIV Corps were transferred from AKA's to LST's. The\r\n96th Division on 9 October issued a final field order for the Leyte\r\noperation. This order allowed the regimental headquarters less than\r\nforty-eight hours to complete final orders, plans, and maps, and\r\ndistribute them to the headquarters of the assault battalions. [134]\r\n\r\nOn 11 October the LST transports carrying the assault battalions filed\r\nout of the Manus anchorage, and on 14 October the rest of the convoy\r\nagain formed and started on the last stretch of the journey. [135]\r\nIts progress was satisfactory, and on 15 October the President of the\r\nUnited States sent his best wishes for the success of the operation to\r\nPresident Sergio Osmeña of the Philippine Commonwealth, who was at sea\r\nwith the expedition. [136] When the III Amphibious Force rendezvoused\r\nwith the Seventh Fleet, the largest convoy ever seen in the Pacific\r\nup to that time was formed. [137]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nComposition of the Convoy\r\n\r\nThirty-four months had been spent in building and preparing these\r\ncombatant and amphibious vessels. Practically none of them were\r\nin existence at the time Corregidor was besieged. Most of the 183\r\nvessels of Task Force 77 were warships, while Task Forces 78 and 79,\r\nthe amphibious forces, consisted mainly of transports, cargo ships,\r\nand a wide variety of landing ships and craft. Fully 518 ocean-going\r\nvessels were included in Task Forces 78 and 79. [138]\r\n\r\nOf the vessels assigned to participate in the operation, 157 were\r\ncombatant ships: 6 old battleships, 5 heavy cruisers, 6 light cruisers,\r\n18 escort carriers, 86 destroyers, 25 destroyer escorts, and 11\r\nfrigates. There were 420 transport vessels, including 5 command ships,\r\n40 attack transports, 10 LSD's, 151 LST's, 79 LCI's, 21 LCT's, and 18\r\nhigh-speed transports. The remainder included patrol, mine-sweeping,\r\nhydrographic, and service ships. [139]\r\n\r\nThe convoy did not include the combatant ships of Admiral Halsey's\r\nThird Fleet. The main striking force of the Third Fleet was Task\r\nForce 38, composed of four powerful carrier task groups, under Admiral\r\nMitscher. Each group contained fast carriers, cruisers, destroyers,\r\nand the newest American battleships. [140]\r\n\r\nAfter forming, the convoy proceeded toward the target. At this time\r\na disquieting report was received from the meteorologists on board\r\nthe ships: a typhoon was headed toward the Leyte Gulf area. Such a\r\ndisturbance could be fatal to the expedition. A severe storm did in\r\nfact lash the gulf area from 14 through 17 October, but it gradually\r\nabated and the morning of A Day, 20 October, was clear. This favorable\r\nweather augured well for a successful landing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSoftening the Target\r\n\r\nEarly Strikes\r\n\r\nAllied aircraft had already visited the Philippine Archipelago. The\r\nfirst aerial strikes since 1942 were made in the early fall of 1944. On\r\n1 September B-24's from New Guinea bases initiated their first\r\nlarge-scale air attack against airdromes in the Davao area, though\r\nbad weather prevented the protective fighter escort from attacking the\r\ntarget. The airborne defense encountered was surprisingly light--only\r\nthree intercepting fighters opposed the strike. The bombers dropped\r\n100 tons of bombs, destroying 34 planes on the ground and killing\r\nabout 100 men. [141] Two American bombers were shot down and six\r\nreceived minor damages. [142] General MacArthur believed that the\r\nJapanese were conserving their air strength in order to concentrate\r\nit against anticipated Allied landings. [143]\r\n\r\nOn 4 September the first aerial reconnaissance flights were made over\r\nLeyte. During the period 9-14 September, Admiral Mitscher launched\r\na large-scale, carrier-based air assault against the Japanese air\r\ndefenses in the Philippine Islands in order to protect the Palau and\r\nMorotai landings. On 9 September aircraft from the carriers attacked\r\nairdromes and installations in the Mindanao area, destroying 60\r\naircraft on the ground and 8 in the air. On 12 September the attack\r\nwas directed against the Visayan Islands. Of an estimated air strength\r\nof 225 aircraft in the sector, 125 were destroyed on the ground and\r\n75 in the air. During the night of 12 September the Japanese flew in\r\nreinforcements from Luzon. A Third Fleet strike on 13 September against\r\nthe reinforced air strength destroyed an estimated 135 aircraft on\r\nthe ground and 81 in the air. On the 14th, the Third Fleet planes\r\nencountered no enemy air opposition but destroyed from 10 to 15\r\naircraft on the ground. The air strength which the enemy had conserved\r\nfor an anticipated American invasion was thus decimated. About 500,\r\nor approximately 57 percent of the 884 aircraft believed to be in the\r\nPhilippines, were rendered nonoperational or destroyed. This successful\r\nknocking out of the Japanese air strength in the Philippine Islands\r\nwas an important factor in the decision to speed up the landing at\r\nLeyte by two months.\r\n\r\nOn 21 September Central Pacific carrier-based aircraft directed their\r\nattention to the Luzon area. In spite of their vigorous defense of\r\nthe Luzon airfields, the Japanese lost an estimated 110 aircraft in\r\nthe air and 95 on the ground. These included not only combat aircraft\r\nbut also reconnaissance, transport, and training planes. The remaining\r\nair strength in the area was estimated to be 350 aircraft, of which\r\n10 percent were in Mindanao, 20 percent in the Visayan Islands,\r\nand 70 percent in Luzon.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the carrier-based aircraft made strong strikes\r\nagainst enemy shipping in the central and southern Philippines. It\r\nwas estimated that from 1 September to 15 September 105 merchant\r\nvessels were sunk in those waters by carrier planes, destroyers,\r\ncruisers, and submarines. Although exact information was lacking on\r\nthe number of enemy vessels present in the Visayan and Mindanao areas,\r\nit was thought that 50 percent of the Japanese merchant marine in\r\nthose areas was eliminated. A successful attrition of the Japanese\r\nair and naval strength in the Philippines had been accomplished. [144]\r\n\r\nThe Third Fleet's carriers then started to neutralize the approaches\r\nto the Philippine Islands. The carrier-based aircraft launched\r\nstrikes against enemy aircraft staging areas in the Ryukyus, of which\r\nOkinawa is the largest and most important. As a result of attacks on\r\n10 October, they destroyed an estimated 23 enemy planes in the air\r\nand 88 on the ground or in the water. Admiral Halsey reported that\r\nhis flyers sank 1 subtender, 1 mine sweeper, 1 destroyer escort,\r\n2 mine-craft, 4 midget submarines, 20 cargo ships, and 45 other\r\ncraft. In addition, nearly as many ships, mostly of small size,\r\nwere damaged. [145] On 11 October the flyers struck at Luzon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAir and Naval Action in the Formosa Area\r\n\r\nThe plans of the Third Fleet called for strong carrier-based strikes\r\nagainst Formosa on 12 and 13 October. The four task groups of Task\r\nForce 38 were assigned targets in the southern Formosa, northern\r\nFormosa, central Formosa, and the Takao areas, respectively. (Takao\r\nis a port city on the southwest coast of Formosa.) After a fast run\r\non the night of 11-12 October the carriers of Task Force 38 arrived\r\nin position off Formosa in the early morning. Although the Japanese\r\nwere aware of the approach of the task force, they made no attacks\r\nagainst it before dawn. As the first fighters started sweeps over\r\ntheir respective areas, heavy opposition developed, but it dropped\r\nmarkedly during the day. From 12 to 14 October the Japanese lost some\r\n280 aircraft, [146] while the Americans lost 76. As a result of the\r\noperation, the Japanese lost half of their naval air strength. This\r\nloss gave assurance that the U. S. forces would have air superiority\r\nover the Leyte area on A Day. [147]\r\n\r\nOn the evening of 13 October the American heavy cruiser Canberra\r\nwas torpedoed eighty-five miles off Formosa. Admiral Halsey kept\r\nhis forces in the area another day in order to afford protection to\r\nthe Canberra. Attacks, therefore, continued against enemy aircraft,\r\nairfields, and installations. By this time, Japanese reinforcements\r\nhad arrived. On the evening of 14 October an aerial torpedo hit the\r\nheavy cruiser Houston.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Halsey decided to capitalize on the damage inflicted on the two\r\ncruisers. He ordered two task groups, which included the battleships,\r\nto retire eastward out of sight; he sent another of the task groups\r\nto conduct intermittent air raids against northern Luzon; and he\r\nassigned the remaining task group to protect the crippled Canberra and\r\nHouston. Halsey instructed this last task group to send out messages in\r\nthe clear begging piteously for assistance. He hoped that by this ruse,\r\nwhich he called the \"Lure of the Streamlined Bait,\" the Japanese fleet\r\nwould be led to believe that this task group was all that remained of\r\nthe task force and would therefore sweep down for the kill. The two\r\ntask groups which had retired eastward would then appear and engage\r\nthe enemy. The Japanese swallowed the bait and dispatched destroyers\r\nand cruisers toward the \"crippled\" American force. Unfortunately,\r\ntheir search planes uncovered the two task forces off Formosa, and\r\nthe Japanese surface ships hastily withdrew.\r\n\r\nThe enemy pilots made such greatly exaggerated claims of success that\r\nImperial General Headquarters decided to order out the 2d Diversion\r\nAttack Force against the Americans. The flying units of Carrier\r\nDivisions 3 and 4 were transferred to the 2d Air Fleet. These air\r\nunits proceeded to Formosa on the 12th of October. Carrier Divisions\r\n3 and 4, however, remained in the Inland Sea until they sortied forth\r\nfor the Battle of Leyte Gulf. [148] The exaggerated claims of the\r\nJapanese air force were accepted jubilantly on the home islands. The\r\npeople felt that the American Navy had indeed been given a death\r\nblow, and the Finance Ministry distributed \"celebration sake\" to\r\nall households in the country to commemorate the event. The Tokyo\r\nradio made the unfounded claim that \"a total of 57 enemy warships\r\nincluding 19 aircraft carriers and four battleships were sunk or\r\nheavily damaged by the Japanese forces ... the enemy task forces\r\nlost the majority of their strength and were put to rout....\" [149]\r\nIt also predicted that the Allied losses would delay the invasion of\r\nthe Philippine Islands by two months. [150]\r\n\r\nAdmiral Halsey's reaction was to report that \"all 3d Fleet Ships\r\nreported by radio Tokyo as sunk have now been salvaged and are retiring\r\ntowards the enemy.\" [151]\r\n\r\nThe convoy, as it steamed toward Leyte, received the news of the\r\nUnited States success with considerable satisfaction. At this time,\r\nhowever, Admiral Halsey announced that the Third Fleet was being\r\ndeployed for action, since he was expecting the Japanese to rise\r\nto his bait. Consequently the Third Fleet, except for the current\r\nstrike at Luzon, could not furnish any more carrier support for the\r\noperation. [152] The Third Fleet task group which went to the Luzon\r\narea successfully struck at enemy airfields and shipping. From 17 to\r\n19 October it destroyed an estimated ninety-nine enemy aircraft on\r\nthe ground and ninety-five in the air. [153]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRealignment of Air Support\r\n\r\nOn the heels of Admiral Halsey's announcement that no assistance in\r\nconnection with the Leyte landings could be expected from the Third\r\nFleet, Far East Air Forces stated that the Fifth Air Force would\r\nsupport the Leyte operation as a \"priority mission.\" [154] At the\r\nsame time the Seventh Fleet requested intensive reconnaissance of\r\nSan Bernardino and Surigao Straits in the Leyte area. This mission\r\nwas assigned to the Fifth Air Force, which was also charged with\r\nneutralizing the Visayan airfields. The Thirteenth Air Force was to\r\nexpedite the basing on Morotai of heavy bombers which could be called\r\nforward in support when requested by the Fifth Air Force. From 18 to\r\n19 October the carrier aircraft of the Seventh Fleet protected the\r\nconvoy and struck at small vessels and airfields in northern Mindanao\r\nas well as defense and communications installations and airfields on\r\nLeyte. [155]\r\n\r\nAlthough the missions Admiral Halsey had assigned his carriers\r\napparently prevented any aircraft of the Third Fleet from participating\r\nin direct support of the landings, Halsey nevertheless ordered one\r\nof the task groups to strike at the Leyte, Samar, Cebu, and Negros\r\nareas on 18-19 October and to provide direct air support for the\r\nLeyte operation on 20 October. [156] Moreover, by 18 October news\r\nwas received that the Japanese had discovered the ruse and withdrawn\r\ntheir warships from the Formosa area, thus leaving Admiral Halsey's\r\nforces free to protect the operation by covering San Bernardino and\r\nSurigao Straits. [157]\r\n\r\nThe carrier force of the Seventh Fleet was to bear the brunt of the\r\ntactical air support. By the afternoon and night of 17 October the\r\nweather had cleared, and flying conditions were perfect as the carriers\r\nmoved into their operation areas the following morning. The force was\r\ndivided into three units: one unit operated in the southern part of\r\nLeyte Gulf to protect the landings at Panaon Strait; another operated\r\nnear the entrance to the gulf in order to support the landings of\r\nthe Southern Attack Force at Dulag; and the last operated southeast\r\nof Samar Island to support the landings of the Northern Attack Force\r\nat Tacloban.\r\n\r\nDuring 18 and 19 October, aircraft from the carriers struck at\r\nenemy airfields on Cebu, Negros, and Panay Islands. There was very\r\nlittle enemy activity from the Japanese airfields in the Leyte area,\r\nsince they were still sodden from the recent storms. In the two days'\r\nstrikes, the Seventh Fleet aircraft destroyed an estimated thirty-six\r\nenemy planes and damaged twenty-eight more. [158]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJapanese Plan of Defense\r\n\r\nThe air blows on the Philippines served as a warning that the Americans\r\nwere ready to return to the Islands--an event long expected by the\r\nJapanese. By the end of June 1944, the Japanese military situation\r\nhad considerably worsened. The outer circle of Japan's perimeter had\r\nbeen pierced and the impetus of the American drive showed no signs\r\nof slackening. (Map 4)\r\n\r\nThe Allied nations had hit the Japanese from east and west and\r\nseriously interfered with their seaborne commerce. Japan was in grave\r\ndanger of being separated from her stolen southern area--the source\r\nof her raw materials. Units within this area were also being forcibly\r\nisolated from each other. The fall of Saipan had brought about a\r\n\"most serious crisis.\" Premier Tojo was removed and Kuniaki Koiso\r\nformed a new cabinet. [159]\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1944 Imperial General Headquarters had started to\r\nstrengthen the Philippines, the Ryukyus, the Kurile Islands, and Japan\r\nitself--the \"first line of sea defense.\" If the Allies landed forces\r\nin any of these areas, the Japanese would concentrate their land,\r\nair, and sea forces and attempt to repel the landing force. These\r\noperations were known as the SHO (Victory) Operations. Defense of\r\nthe Philippines was SHO I. [160]\r\n\r\nThe Japanese strategy was simple. Japan wished to remain in the war,\r\nand to do so she must at all costs keep open the lines of communication\r\nto the sources of her raw materials in the Netherlands Indies.\r\n\r\nIn the first part of August 1944, the headquarters of the 14th Area\r\nArmy, which was to be charged with the defense of the Philippine\r\nArchipelago, was organized under the command of the Southern Army,\r\nwhile the 35th Army, which was to defend the Visayan Islands, was\r\nestablished under the command of the 14th Area Army. [161]\r\n\r\nThe Philippine Islands were under the jurisdiction of the Southern\r\nArmy, whose command organization was extremely complex. (Chart 3)\r\nThe supreme commander was Field Marshal Count Hisaichi Terauchi. There\r\nwere four area armies in the Southern Army: the 2d Area Army occupied\r\nNetherlands New Guinea, thence west to Timor; the 7th Area Army was\r\nat Singapore; the Burma Area Army was at Rangoon; and the 14th Area\r\nArmy, commanded by Lt. Gen. Shigenori Kuroda, was in the Philippines\r\nwith its headquarters at Manila. The Southern Army also had two air\r\narmies and three garrison armies: the 3d Air Army in Singapore; the\r\n4th Air Army, consisting of two air divisions in the Philippines and\r\none air division in western New Guinea; and a garrison army stationed\r\nin Thailand, another in French Indochina, and a third in Borneo. The\r\ncommander of the 14th Area Army maintained a staff liaison with the\r\n4th Air Army but otherwise had no control over it.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Air Fleet, under the command of the Southwest Area\r\nFleet, was stationed in the Philippines, with headquarters at\r\nManila. Admiral Soemu Toyoda, commander in chief of the Combined\r\nFleet with headquarters at Tokyo, controlled the entire naval forces,\r\nincluding the Southwest Area Fleet. [162]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlans for the 14th Area Army\r\n\r\nThe Japanese during the summer of 1944 anticipated that the United\r\nStates forces would return to the Philippine Islands, but when and\r\nwhere were two questions for which not even Tokyo Rose, the Japanese\r\nradio propagandist, had the answers. Consequently, the Japanese wished\r\nto keep their troops sufficiently mobile that reinforcements might be\r\nrushed to the point of contact. The original plan called for the main\r\ndefensive effort of the ground forces to be made on Luzon, since there\r\nwere too few Japanese troops in the archipelago to defend all of the\r\nPhilippines. The Japanese Navy and Air Forces, however, were to carry\r\nout \"decisive\" actions in the central and southern Philippines. [163]\r\n\r\nTo General Kuroda fell the task of making and executing plans for the\r\ndefense of the Philippines by the 14th Area Army. General Kuroda was\r\nessentially a realist. He stated in June 1947 that in October 1944 he\r\nhad told Maj. Gen. Seizo Arisue, Chief of Army Intelligence, Imperial\r\nGeneral Headquarters, that \"it would be best for Japan to negotiate\r\nan immediate peace before the Americans could destroy our nation\r\nby air power.\" [164] Kuroda thought that all available land forces\r\nshould be concentrated in the Luzon area in order to counterattack\r\nany American landing within the Luzon perimeter. However, because\r\nof their predominant aerial strength, the Americans in their next\r\nattempt could unless they made \"some terrible mistake ... land in\r\nforce and once ashore, could take the Philippines.\" [165] General\r\nKuroda's plan was never considered. Imperial General Headquarters'\r\nplan for the defense of the Philippines called for the employment of\r\nten divisions and five brigades: five divisions and two brigades in\r\nLuzon, four divisions and two brigades in the southern Philippines,\r\nand one division and one brigade in China and Formosa. The two units\r\nlast mentioned would be rushed to the Philippines as soon as the\r\nAmerican landing became imminent. [166] When the Americans landed,\r\nall of these units, acting in concert, were to participate in fighting\r\na decisive battle against the American troops. This plan was never\r\ncarried out in its entirety.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese occupation troops of the Philippine Islands had grown\r\nsoft and had \"no particular will to fight.\" In the spring of 1944,\r\nthere were only minor units available to set up an organized defense.\r\n\r\nImperial General Headquarters and the Southern Army thought that\r\nbecause of the many islands in the archipelago emphasis should be\r\nplaced on air power. Air attacks could destroy the American forces\r\nbefore they arrived at the landing areas or at least before they\r\ncould make appreciable gains. The way could then be opened to turn a\r\ndefense into an offensive. [167] General Kuroda threw cold water on\r\nthis plan by bluntly stating:\r\n\r\n\r\n    That concept is good, but you cannot fight with concept\r\n    alone. Words alone will not sink American ships and that becomes\r\n    clear when you compare our airplanes with theirs. That is why the\r\n    major battles have been occurring on land. We can say that the\r\n    power of our air force is negligible at this time. No matter how\r\n    much the Fourteenth Army devotes their efforts toward air power,\r\n    in actuality, should there be a decisive fight, they must fight\r\n    on land. The preparation and conduct of an operation, and the\r\n    responsibilities thereof cannot be conducted by airplanes and air\r\n    units. The land army should initiate its own preparations. For\r\n    example, for what purpose were the group of air bases constructed\r\n    at Davao and Tacloban? Even though they are built, they aren't\r\n    used. It amounts to construction for the use of the enemy. [168]\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the month of August, the Japanese devoted their main efforts\r\ntoward strengthening the air force. After the first of September\r\nmore emphasis was placed on building up the ground troops while\r\nthe air preparations continued to some extent. The Southern Army in\r\nlate August ordered about one half of a division to Sarangani and\r\none division to Davao against the wishes of the 14th Area Army. This\r\nmeant a reshuffling of the troops that had been moving and repairing\r\ndefenses since the first part of August. \"The order was carried out\r\nbegrudgingly.\" [169]\r\n\r\nLt Gen. Sosaku Suzuki, the commander of the 35th Army, thinking that\r\nthe American Army would land on 1 October, said: \"Contrary to what\r\nhas been announced by General Headquarters our air force cannot be\r\nprepared and equipped in time, nor can the Combined Fleet be depended\r\nupon. The situation grows worse and for this reason the land force\r\npreparations must be hastened. Yet, in spite of that, we must not\r\ndiscourage the air forces and should do as much as possible to prepare\r\naggressive aerial opposition.\" [170]\r\n\r\nIn the middle of September, Imperial General Headquarters decided\r\nto replace General Kuroda with General Tomoyuki Yamashita. Not only\r\ndid General Kuroda have a concept of the Philippine operations that\r\ndiffered from that of his superiors, but he was charged with neglecting\r\nhis duty as field army commander. [171] Lt. Col. Seiichi Yoshie of\r\nthe Personnel Bureau of the War Ministry, who had been sent to the\r\nPhilippines to investigate personnel matters in the Southern Army,\r\nsaid of the incident:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Stories reached the War Ministry that Lt. Gen. Kuroda was devoting\r\n    more time to his golf, reading and personal matters than to the\r\n    execution of his official duties. It appeared that his control\r\n    over staff officers and troops was not sufficiently strong and\r\n    that there was a good deal of unfavorable criticism of his conduct\r\n    among the troops. There were also indications that discipline\r\n    was becoming very lax.\r\n\r\n    On 4 September 1944, I left Tokyo under orders ... to\r\n    investigate. As a result I obtained many statements substantiating\r\n    the unfavorable stories in regard to Lt. Gen. Kuroda. The\r\n    recommendations of all the staff was that Lt. Gen. Kuroda be\r\n    relieved as soon as possible, and be replaced by Gen. Yamashita\r\n    ... who was a superb tactician and excellent leader. [172]\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Yamashita, who was in Manchuria, received notification of\r\nhis appointment on 23 September, and on the 9th of October he assumed\r\ncommand of the 14th Area Army. [173] On his arrival in the Philippines,\r\nhe found conditions were \"unsatisfactory.\" Of the eleven members\r\nof the old staff only five were left and the new staff officers\r\nwere unfamiliar with conditions in the Philippine Islands. [174]\r\nThe state of affairs was well exemplified by a remark of his new\r\nchief of staff, Lt. Gen. Akira Muto, who arrived in the Philippines\r\non 20 October from Sumatra, where he had been in command of the 2d\r\nImperial Guards Division. [175] Upon being told that the Americans\r\nhad landed on Leyte, Muto is said to have replied, \"Very interesting,\r\nbut where is Leyte?\" [176]\r\n\r\nMaj. Gen. Toshio Nishimura, one of three assistants to Yamashita,\r\nstates that the planning for the Leyte campaign was \"very bad.\" The\r\nsupply situation, however, was favorable. Since Manila was the main\r\ndepot not only for the Philippines but also for other places in the\r\nsouth such as Borneo and Singapore, a sufficient amount of everything\r\nneeded was at hand. [177]\r\n\r\nThere were two tactical concepts of defense of the islands in July\r\nand August 1944. One was termed the policy of \"annihilation at the\r\nbeachhead\" and the other the policy of \"resistance in depth.\" The\r\nrespective merits of the two concepts were bitterly debated by their\r\npartisans. The proponents of resistance in depth thought that the\r\nbeach defenses, which had been constructed with a great deal of\r\nlabor, were useless, since it was believed they could not withstand\r\nnaval bombardment. On the other hand, the friends of annihilation\r\nat the beachhead felt that semipermanent beach fortifications could\r\nwithstand bombardment. Imperial General Headquarters, after studying\r\nthe battle lessons of the Pacific Campaign and the actual effect of\r\nnaval bombardment, decided to adopt the resistance in depth tactics and\r\ninstructed the entire army forces to comply. Consequently, the various\r\ngroup commanders abandoned their beach defenses with regret and began\r\nto build strong fortifications in selected areas of the interior. [178]\r\n\r\nThe control of the Visayan Islands and Mindanao was vested in the 35th\r\nArmy, which was the equivalent of an American army corps. General\r\nSuzuki, its commander, compromised between the two concepts of\r\ndefense. At a meeting of the 35th Army unit commanders in the middle\r\nof August 1944, he stated that although the main battle was to be\r\nfought away from the beaches some troops should remain to resist\r\nthe American landings and \"therefore part of the troops must suffer\r\npremature losses.\" [179]\r\n\r\nThe 16th, 102d, 30th, and the 100th Divisions, which were in\r\nLeyte, Panay, and Mindanao, were placed under the 35th Army, whose\r\nheadquarters was at Cebu. [180]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Suzu Plan\r\n\r\nOn 17 August General Suzuki issued the Suzu orders for the defense\r\nof the Visayan Islands and Mindanao by the 35th Army. The 100th\r\nDivision was to protect the Davao area on Mindanao while the 16th\r\nDivision would defend Leyte. Most of the 30th Division and two infantry\r\nbattalions were made mobile units which could be rushed to annihilate\r\nthe American force wherever it landed. However, if the Americans landed\r\nsimultaneously on Davao and Leyte, the main force of the 30th Division\r\nwas to be sent to Davao and the other mobile units would go to Leyte.\r\n\r\nIn late August, Suzuki received orders to dispose his troops as\r\nfollows: a reinforced division in the Davao area, three battalions in\r\nthe Sarangani Bay area, three battalions in the vicinity of Zamboanga,\r\ntwo battalions in the Jolo Islands, a \"strong unit\" in the vicinity of\r\nSurigao, and one division in the Leyte Gulf area. The 55th Independent\r\nMixed Brigade was to be assigned to the 35th Army. Units of the\r\n16th Division which were in Luzon were sent to the 16th Division\r\non Leyte. These elements, which consisted of one engineer company,\r\nan independent transportation unit, and a medical unit, were placed\r\nunder the commander of the 33d Infantry Regiment. [181]\r\n\r\nLt. Gen. Shiro Makino, commanding the 16th Division, which was the\r\nmajor force on Leyte, had directed his efforts since April 1944\r\ntoward the construction of defensive positions on the island. The\r\nfirst line of defense, which was on the east coast in the Dulag area,\r\nwas practically completed by the middle of October. The third defensive\r\nline was in the middle of Leyte Valley in the vicinity of Dagami. The\r\nsecond line of defense was between the two others, while the bulk of\r\nsupplies was assembled in the central mountain range at Jaro.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the other troops at the time of the American\r\nlandings was as follows: one battalion of the 9th Infantry Regiment\r\nin the Catmon Hill and Tanauan district, and the main strength of\r\nthe 33d Infantry Regiment in the Palo and Tacloban area. The larger\r\npart of the 33d Infantry Regiment, which was less adequately trained\r\nthan the other regiments, had arrived on Leyte in mid-September from\r\nLuzon. Its officers were unfamiliar with the terrain and did not\r\nfortify their positions. [182]\r\n\r\nOn 17 October General Makino, having heard that American warships\r\nhad approached Leyte Gulf, alerted the 16th Division for the\r\nimpending battle and ordered all units to \"shatter the enemy landing\r\nattempts.\" [183] On 18 October the 14th Area Army received a report\r\nfrom the 16th Division which indicated that the latter was not certain\r\nthe vessels sighted off Leyte were an enemy attacking force. They\r\nmight be ships seeking safety from the storms, or vessels damaged in\r\nthe naval battle off Formosa. Consequently, 14th Area Army was not\r\nsure that an attack was imminent at Leyte. [184]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlans for the 4th Air Army\r\n\r\nThe principal assignment of the 4th Air Army was to attack\r\nAmerican transports and interdict American shipping and, if given\r\nthe opportunity, to attack the American combatant vessels. The\r\n4th Air Army was also to give aerial support to the movement of\r\nreinforcements. [185]\r\n\r\nIn October the 4th Air Army issued a plan for anticipated\r\noperations. In co-operation with the Army and the Navy, the 4th Air\r\nArmy would attempt to destroy the American forces when they struck the\r\nPhilippines. The Army air force in concert with the naval air units\r\nwould try to destroy carrier-based planes and air bases. In operations\r\nagainst the American fleet, the Army and Navy air units were to have\r\n\"a unified and tactful commitment.\" If the naval air units could not\r\nco-operate the Army air force was to venture a surprise attack with\r\na few planes. Dusk, night, and dawn attacks were to be made against\r\nAllied air bases and all means exerted to foil Allied attempts to\r\nestablish advance bases in the Philippines. The main strength of the\r\nfighter units was to move into the central and southern Philippines in\r\norder to destroy the principal American landing force. The mission\r\nof the Japanese 4th Air Army, operating from Mindanao, Celebes,\r\nand northern Borneo, would be restricted to checking the current\r\nattempts on the part of the Americans to establish bases on Halmahera\r\nand western New Guinea and the destruction of the planes there. For\r\nthis purpose the Japanese air force would use bases in the southern\r\nPhilippines.\r\n\r\nWhen the American convoy was sighted moving toward the Philippines, the\r\nheavy bombers were to deploy to the central and southern Philippines\r\nand make preparations for an immediate attack on the convoy after it\r\nhad arrived in the harbor. The fighter units were to attack Allied\r\naircraft and, if the circumstances were propitious, were also to attack\r\nthe convoy. If the Americans should attempt simultaneous landings at\r\nvarious points, the Japanese Army air forces would \"try to annihilate\r\nthe landing parties one by one,\" [186] acting in concert with the\r\nJapanese Navy.\r\n\r\nCapt. Toshikazu Ohmae, the chief of staff to the commander in chief of\r\nthe Japanese Third Fleet, was highly critical of the liaison between\r\nthe Army and Navy air forces. \"The Army and Navy always quarreled\r\nwith each other. In theory they were supposed to cooperate and on the\r\nhigher levels it would work, but personalities were the trouble.\" [187]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJapanese Navy Plans\r\n\r\nOn 21 July 1944 Admiral Toyoda received a directive which laid down\r\nthe basic policies for subsequent \"urgent operations.\" A great deal\r\nof the contracting empire was abandoned. The Southwest Area, which\r\nembraced the region from Manila to Singapore, was ordered to \"maintain\r\nsecurity of resources areas, hold vital sectors for their defense, and\r\nplace emphasis on protection for fleet anchorages.\" Thus the Japanese\r\nplanned to restrict battle \"to the homeland and to the island chain\r\nwhich protected the last links\" of the empire with the south. The\r\nforces in the Japanese home islands, the Ryukyu chain, Formosa, and\r\nthe Philippine Islands were told to take \"all measures to expedite the\r\nestablishment of conditions to cope with decisive battle. In event\r\nof enemy attack, summon all strength which can be concentrated and\r\nhold vital sectors, in general intercepting and destroying the enemy\r\nwithin the operational sphere of planes of our base air force.\" [188]\r\n\r\nThe success of Admiral Halsey's carrier strikes against Formosa had\r\nconsiderably weakened the strength of Japanese carrier-based planes,\r\nand less than one half of the Army planes remained. The necessity\r\nof sending reinforcements to Formosa also weakened considerably the\r\nJapanese aerial defense of the Philippines. The enemy became almost\r\ncompletely dependent upon the remaining land-based planes. [189] Within\r\ntheir capabilities the Japanese had made their plans and readied their\r\nforces, as the American convoy steamed towards Leyte to do battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecuring the Channel Approaches\r\n\r\nLandings of the 6th Ranger Infantry Battalion\r\n\r\nThe forward part of the convoy, which was carrying the 6th Ranger\r\nInfantry Battalion, commanded by Lt. Col. Henry A. Mucci, had\r\nexperienced stormy weather since leaving Hollandia, but by dawn of the\r\n17th the storm had slackened, though the ocean was still choppy. The\r\ntransports carrying the reinforced 6th Ranger Battalion, preceded by\r\nthree mine sweepers, entered Leyte Gulf. [190]\r\n\r\nThe USS Crosby, carrying Company D, arrived on schedule off Suluan\r\nIsland, the outermost of the islands guarding Leyte Gulf. For twenty\r\nminutes the cruiser Denver shelled the island. Under lowering skies\r\nand in a driving rain which rendered impossible the anticipated air\r\nsupport, [191] Company D, under 1st Lt. Leslie M. Gray, disembarked\r\nfrom the transport and headed for the island in landing craft. The\r\nmission of the unit was to secure mine charts which were believed to be\r\nlocated in a lighthouse on the island. At 0805 the boats touched shore.\r\n\r\nThe landing was unopposed. The men immediately filed south 500\r\nyards on a trail along the coast and then headed east toward the\r\nlighthouse. On the way, four buildings, one of which contained a\r\nJapanese radio, were found and set ablaze. The company then continued\r\nalong the trail. Suddenly the enemy fired from a concealed position,\r\nkilling one man and wounding another. When Company D went into attack\r\nformation, the enemy force disappeared into the heavy jungle bordering\r\nthe trail. The march was resumed and the company reached its objective\r\nwithout further incident. The lighthouse, which had been damaged by\r\nnaval bombardment, and adjoining buildings were deserted. [192]\r\n\r\nIn searching the documents found in the lighthouse, the company failed\r\nto turn up the hoped-for enemy mine charts. [193] It returned to the\r\nbeachhead area and, finding that the landing boats had been hopelessly\r\nbattered and broken up by the surf, formed a perimeter for the night.\r\n\r\nAs Company D was moving along the coast of Suluan Island, naval fire\r\nblasted away at the extreme northwest coast of Dinagat Island. At 0900\r\nthe first assault waves of the 6th Rangers, minus Companies D and B,\r\nstarted for the beach. Although coral reefs approximately one hundred\r\nyards offshore grounded the boats so that the men had to wade the\r\nremainder of the distance, the companies were all ashore by 1230. No\r\nJapanese were on the island and the troops accomplished their mission,\r\nthe erection of a navigation light at Desolation Point to guide the\r\nmovement of the main portion of the convoy.\r\n\r\nCompany B of the 6th Rangers was to have landed on Homonhon Island at\r\nthe same time landings were made on Suluan and Dinagat. Its mission,\r\ntoo, was the emplacement of a navigation light, but bad weather\r\nand choppy seas kept the troops confined to the ship throughout the\r\n17th. [194] On the morning of the 18th, the ship's address system\r\nclanged out general quarters. The men went below, put on their gear,\r\nand checked their weapons. At 0900 the troops were told to prepare to\r\ndisembark. They bolted up the ladders and spilled out over the deck to\r\nthe davits. [195] The boats were lowered and the first wave started for\r\nthe beach. At the same time the guns from the destroyer and frigate\r\nwhich had escorted the transport concentrated fire against the shore\r\nline for twelve minutes. Three minutes later, the boats grounded on a\r\ncoral reef forty yards from the beach, and the men waded the remaining\r\ndistance to shore. They encountered no resistance and at 1038 the\r\ncompany commander, Capt. Arthur D. Simons, notified the battalion\r\ncommander, \"Beachhead secured, supplies ashore. No resistance. No\r\ncasualties.\" [196] The company set up a channel light.\r\n\r\nBy 18 October, steady white lights were beaming from Dinagat and\r\nHomonhon Islands to guide the convoy in to Leyte Island. The one\r\non Dinagat had a visibility of twelve miles and that on Homonhon a\r\nvisibility of ten. [197]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMine Sweeping\r\n\r\nThe mine-sweeping plans contemplated that the mine-sweeping group\r\nwould arrive on 17 October simultaneously with the troops that were\r\nto storm Suluan, Dinagat, and Homonhon Islands. On 11 October the\r\nslow-moving mine sweepers lifted anchor at Manus and departed for the\r\nobjective area. They rendezvoused near the Palaus with the Dinagat\r\nforce, which had left Hollandia on 12 October. On 15 October they were\r\njoined by the carriers and the beach demolition and bombardment and\r\nfire support groups which had sortied from Manus on 12 October. On\r\n14 October information was received from guerrilla sources that\r\nthere were no underwater obstacles off the beaches between Abuyog\r\nand Tacloban. Although the northern Surigao Strait was mined, it was\r\nconsidered doubtful whether the same condition existed at the southern\r\nentrances of Leyte Gulf. [198] The mine-sweeping groups that had left\r\nHollandia on 11 October arrived in Leyte Gulf during the storm of the\r\nevening of 16 October. Some of the mine sweepers had been delayed\r\nby the storm but were able to arrive in time to begin sweeping the\r\nchannels. [199]\r\n\r\nIn the early dawn of 17 October the mine sweepers began their work\r\non the channel approaches to Suluan Island. [200] By 0630 they had\r\naccomplished their task and then began to sweep the waters of the\r\nlanding areas in Leyte Gulf until the storm forced them to suspend\r\noperations. At 1259 they resumed sweeping with great difficulty. Until\r\nA Day, intensive area and tactical mine sweeping continued. The\r\nsweepers started at dawn each day and worked continuously until\r\nnightfall. By 19 October it was known that the Japanese had heavily\r\nmined the approaches to Leyte Gulf but that there were no mines\r\nwithin the gulf itself. The northern part of the main channel into\r\nthe gulf, however, was not considered safe. [201] By the same date\r\nsweeping had been completed in the southern half, 186 mines having\r\nbeen destroyed. At about 0135 on 19 October, the destroyer supporting\r\nthe mine-sweeping units which were in the gulf struck a floating mine\r\nand while maneuvering away from the area struck another. The ship\r\nwas disabled and retired from action. By A Day, a total of 227 mines\r\nhad been destroyed and a passage approximately six miles wide had\r\nbeen cleared just north of Dinagat Island. All ships were therefore\r\ndirected to enter Leyte Gulf through that portion of the strait. [202]\r\n\r\nAs the mine sweepers came close to the land, boats containing Filipinos\r\nmoved out to welcome the advance party of liberators. The reception\r\nthey met was not enthusiastic. Admiral Oldendorf, the commanding\r\nofficer of the bombardment and fire support group, \"suspected that\r\nsome might have come seeking information so detained them aboard\r\ntheir respective ships.... Directed no further patriots be taken\r\naboard ship.\" [203]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnderwater Demolition Teams\r\n\r\nThe naval plans for the amphibious phase of the operation contemplated\r\nthe use of seven underwater demolition teams--three to cover the\r\nnorthern coast beaches and four to cover the southern beaches. The\r\nteams, starting A minus 2 (18 October), were to locate underwater\r\nobstructions and detonate mines. On 18 and 19 October the underwater\r\ndemolition teams made a reconnaissance of the landing areas,\r\naccompanied by destroyers which bombarded the shores. The two days'\r\nreconnaissance disclosed no underwater obstacles or mines in the\r\nvicinity of the proposed landing beaches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Convoy Enters Leyte Gulf\r\n\r\nBy the evening of 19 October the preliminary operations were almost\r\ncompleted. The beaches had been surveyed and found suitable for\r\nlanding; mines had been cleared from most of the main approach channel;\r\nand the entrances to Leyte Gulf had been secured. [204]\r\n\r\nAll ships were to be prepared to attach paravanes (mine-cable cutting\r\ndevices) on signal at any time after noon on 19 October. [205] Since\r\nthe mine sweepers had not sufficiently cleared the gulf, paravanes were\r\nattached preparatory to entering it. The mine sweepers were to have\r\nescorted the convoy into the area, but since they would not be ready\r\nfor about two hours, the entry was ordered to be made without them. The\r\nconvoy hugged the Dinagat shore line so closely that the distance from\r\nthe center of the formation to the shore was only 3,800 yards. [206]\r\nSome of the ships did not see the signal light which had been placed\r\non Dinagat Island by the 6th Rangers and were delayed on that account.\r\n\r\nThe convoy advanced without incident toward the target area. On the\r\n18th Admiral Kinkaid radioed General MacArthur that the operations\r\nwere going well, though the storm had somewhat delayed matters, and\r\nthe General was made \"welcome to our city.\" [207] MacArthur in reply\r\nsaid that he was \"glad indeed to be in your domicile and under your\r\nflag. It gives me not only confidence but a sense of inspiration,\"\r\nand, probably thinking of the many arduous months of planning and\r\namphibious operations, he added, \"As Ripley says believe it or not\r\nwe are almost there.\" [208]\r\n\r\nAs the convoy came ever closer to the target, the atmosphere aboard\r\nthe vessels became more and more tense. By 1800 on 19 October most of\r\nthe vessels had arrived outside the gulf. The Far Shore was now near\r\nand could be seen vaguely in the distance. On board one of the vessels\r\nProtestant and Catholic evening prayers were broadcast over the address\r\nsystem. Some of the men felt that it gave them a lift, but many felt\r\nthat they were being administered the last rites of their church. [209]\r\n\r\nAll vessels arrived on schedule. Because the mine barrier in the\r\nentrance had not been completely cleared, the ships entered the\r\ngulf somewhat to the south of the center of the entrance, avoiding\r\nthe main channel and keeping close to the northern point of Dinagat\r\nIsland. Fears that strong ebb tides might impede progress of the\r\nslower vessels through the entrance proved groundless. Paravanes\r\nwere retained until arrival in the transport areas, but no mines were\r\nencountered. [210]\r\n\r\nNaval plans called for bombardment of the enemy-held shores on A minus\r\n2 (18 October), but because the water areas had not been completely\r\nswept for mines by that time, ships could not reach the bombardment\r\narea. On A minus 1, bombardment was chiefly for the purpose of\r\nproviding effective support and coverage for the underwater demolition\r\nteams. However, many of the defenses and installations of the enemy\r\non or near the landing beaches, including buildings and supply dumps,\r\nwere neutralized or destroyed.\r\n\r\nBy the afternoon of 19 October, when it had become apparent to the\r\nJapanese that the Americans had returned to the Philippine Islands,\r\nGeneral Suzuki put his defense plan into effect. He ordered the\r\n16th Division to annihilate the American force, and, failing that,\r\nto interfere as much as possible with the use of Leyte airfields by\r\nthe American Army. The mobile units, including two battalions from the\r\n30th Division, were to speed to Leyte as fast as possible. Finally,\r\nthe headquarters of the 35th Army was to move to Ormoc on the west\r\ncoast of Leyte on the 23d or 24th of October. [211]\r\n\r\nThrough the night of 19-20 October, destroyers near the shore continued\r\nto shell the Japanese forces on land. The American forces were safely\r\nwithin Leyte Gulf--A Day had arrived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nA Day: 20 October 1944\r\n\r\n\r\nBombardment of the Shores of Leyte\r\n\r\nThe waters of Leyte Gulf were glassy calm as the convoys bearing the\r\nassault forces steamed into their appointed positions off the shores\r\nof Leyte in the very early morning hours of 20 October 1944.\r\n\r\nThere were three stages of the naval gunfire support: the pre-A-Day\r\nbombardment, A-Day bombardment, and close supporting missions to be\r\ndelivered after H Hour and to continue until 24 October. A portion of\r\nthe fire support group in support of the underwater demolition teams\r\nhad bombarded the southern landing beaches and the town of Dulag\r\non 18 October, a process which was repeated on the following day in\r\nsupport of the underwater demolition teams on the northern landing\r\nbeaches. [212]\r\n\r\nAt 0600 on A Day, 20 October, the battleships assigned to the\r\nSouthern Attack Force opened fire on the beaches. A lone Japanese\r\nplane appeared at 0612 over the northern beaches, circled the convoy,\r\nand despite gunfire from the Maryland and West Virginia disappeared\r\nunscathed. [213] At 0700 the battleships of the Northern Attack Force\r\ncommenced firing. For two hours the six battleships, three to each\r\nattack force, fired on the beaches. Since no specific targets could\r\nbe discerned or determined, the gunfire was directed at areas. Many\r\nenemy supply dumps and minor military installations were destroyed. An\r\nobserver reported:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Gray smoke plumes are rising from the shores. Battleship\r\n    Mississippi is now working on the northern beaches. She is\r\n    joined by the Maryland whose fire has apparently caused a large\r\n    shore explosion. Jap ack-ack is fired at spotting planes but the\r\n    performance is weak.\r\n\r\n    Battleships move inshore and renew their constant\r\n    thunder. Helldivers and Avengers from our CVE's are heading toward\r\n    the shore.... [214]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt 0900 the battleships ceased their fire and the cruisers and\r\ndestroyers moved in closer to the shore to deliver their scheduled\r\nbombardment. [215]\r\n\r\nAt 0850 gunfire was suspended in the vicinity of Catmon Hill,\r\nthe most prominent coastal terrain feature near Dulag, in order to\r\nallow an air strike against installations in the interior by the\r\nplanes from the CVE's of the amphibious force. During the day a\r\ntotal of 500 sorties by more than 140 planes were flown in direct\r\nsupport. Twelve direct support missions were carried out, nine\r\nagainst selected targets requested by ground troops and three against\r\ntargets of opportunity. Dawn and dusk fighter sweeps were made against\r\nairfields. [216] The aircraft from the carriers, which were beyond the\r\nrange of the guns of enemy coastal defenses, did not attempt secondary\r\nmissions upon the completion of a mission in the target area. [217]\r\n\r\nThe principal bombing and strafing targets were revetments, dispersal\r\nareas, supply dumps, and bivouac areas, together with aircraft on\r\nislands near Leyte. Grounded planes were strafed and destroyed. The\r\ncommander of the escort carriers made the surprising estimate that\r\naircraft from his carriers had destroyed 125 planes on the ground\r\nand damaged an additional 90 more in the first three days of this\r\n\"close support at a distance.\" [218] Aircraft did not bomb the shore\r\nline, since gunfire from the vessels within the gulf was considered\r\nmore effective.\r\n\r\nAt 0900 the cruisers commenced bombarding the beaches. They were joined\r\nat 0930 by the destroyers. At 0945 the cruisers and destroyers lifted\r\ntheir fire and directed it at the inland areas, at the flanks of the\r\nlanding beaches, and at important roads and towns. [219]\r\n\r\nAt 0800 the first anchor chains of the vessels had rattled out; LCVP's\r\nwere quickly swung over the sides; boats circled mother ships and moved\r\nto their rendezvous areas. [220] The LCI mortar and LCI rocket ships\r\ntook their places at the head of the assault waves. It was now 0945,\r\nfifteen minutes before H Hour. The LCI's raced simultaneously to the\r\nshores of Leyte, raking the landing beaches with rocket and mortar\r\nfire. The bombardment grew heavier and more monotonous. Hundreds of\r\nsmall boats, flanked by rocket ships and destroyers, headed toward\r\nthe beaches; thousands of rockets hit the beaches with the rumble of\r\nan earthquake. It was impossible to distinguish one explosion from\r\nanother in the unbroken roar. [221] Over a smooth sea a hot, brilliant,\r\ntropical sun beat down. The American forces were ready to land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX Corps Goes Ashore\r\n\r\nHours earlier reveille had sounded on board the transports and the\r\ntroops had dressed by the red lights in the holds where they were\r\nquartered. There was very little talking. Many of the men sat on their\r\nbunks giving their weapons a final check. Others lay back and smoked\r\nin silence. A few sought the chaplains. [222]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMissions of Sixth Army Summarized\r\n\r\nThe Sixth Army had been ordered to seize and establish beachheads in\r\nthe Dulag and Tacloban areas and to secure the airfields in order to\r\nprovide naval and air bases; and to seize such objectives in the Panaon\r\nStrait area as would permit safe passage of naval forces through the\r\nstrait to the Camotes Sea. [223] To carry out the operation General\r\nKrueger had assigned the 21st Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry\r\nDivision, to gain control of Panaon Strait; the XXIV Corps was to\r\nsecure the Dulag area and its airstrip; and the 1st Cavalry Division\r\nof X Corps was to land in the Marasbaras area and, by advancing north,\r\ncapture the Tacloban airdrome, the most important A-Day objective\r\nfor the Sixth Army. At the same time, the 24th Division, less the\r\n21st Infantry, of the X Corps was to seize Palo and advance rapidly\r\nto the northwest. [224] The seizure of these areas would secure the\r\nimportant coastal airstrips for future air operations, cut off any\r\nJapanese attempts at reinforcement from the southern Philippines\r\nthrough the Mindanao Sea and Sogod Bay, secure the important eastern\r\nentrances into the interior, and enable the American forces to control\r\nSan Pedro Bay and San Juanico Strait.\r\n\r\nThe northernmost unit of X Corps, the 1st Cavalry Division, was to\r\nland in the vicinity of San Jose (also called San Ricardo and San Jose\r\nRicardo) about three miles north of Palo, on White Beach. White Beach\r\nextended southward 2,000 yards from the Cataisan Peninsula. There\r\nwas an interval of 1,500 yards between this beach and the northern\r\nlimit of Red Beach, which was also 2,000 yards long. [225] The 24th\r\nDivision, less the 21st Infantry, was to land in the vicinity of the\r\ntown of Palo, on Red Beach. (Map 5)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1st Cavalry Division\r\n\r\nWhite Beach had a fairly good landing surface of white coral sand,\r\nbut even at high tide it was suitable only for shallow-draft landing\r\ncraft. Its average width was fifteen yards at low tide, at which\r\ntime a small irregular bank two to three feet high appeared at the\r\nwater's edge. The underwater gradient was shallow, extending out\r\nhalf a mile in places. An irregular fringe of coconut trees ran the\r\nlength of the beach. In the southern section this fringe was narrow,\r\nwith very wet and swampy cleared land behind it. Highway 1 roughly\r\nparalleled the beach about a mile inland. [226]\r\n\r\nThe roar of many guns could be heard as the 1st Cavalry Division\r\nprepared to disembark into landing boats, which were to rendezvous\r\nat the line of departure 5,000 yards from shore. A pall of lazily\r\nbillowing yellow smoke obscured the shores of Leyte. [227]\r\n\r\nThe 1st Cavalry Division, commanded by Maj. Gen. Verne D. Mudge,\r\nwas to land on White Beach with brigades abreast--the 1st Brigade\r\non the left (south) and the 2d Brigade on the right (north)--and\r\nadvance inland. The 1st Brigade, under Brig. Gen. William C. Chase,\r\nwas to reconnoiter the hills on the west side of Tacloban Valley\r\nand establish observation posts which would command the entrances\r\nto the valley. The 2d Brigade, under Brig. Gen. Hugh F. Hoffman, had\r\nthe most important mission of the day. It was to advance northwest,\r\ncapture the Tacloban airdrome and seize the Cataisan Peninsula,\r\nreaching Cataisan Point, the northern extremity of the peninsula,\r\nby 1400. Col. William J. Bradley's 8th Cavalry Regiment of the 2d\r\nBrigade was held afloat in division reserve and was to be prepared\r\nto reinforce either the 1st or 2d Brigade. [228]\r\n\r\nFlanked by rocket and gunboat LCI's, and preceded by amphibian tanks,\r\nthe 5th and 12th Cavalry Regiments, which formed the 1st Brigade,\r\nand the 7th Cavalry, which with the 8th Cavalry (in reserve) composed\r\nthe 2d Brigade, raced for the shores of Leyte. The escorting rocket\r\nships laid down a heavy barrage which covered the beach defenses\r\nto a depth of 1,800 yards inland and left the enemy incapable of\r\norganized resistance. As the boats neared shore, only small arms and\r\nmachine gun fire opposed the landing. [229] As planned, the regiments\r\nlanded abreast, the 7th Cavalry Regiment on the right (north), the\r\n12th Cavalry Regiment in the center, and the 5th Cavalry on the left\r\n(south).\r\n\r\nThe 1st Squadron of the 7th Cavalry was to land north of the 2d\r\nSquadron on the northern end of White Beach, which at this point\r\ncoincided with the narrow neck of land connecting the Cataisan\r\nPeninsula to the rest of the island, and then go directly north to\r\nsecure the entire peninsula and the airstrip. On its left the 2d\r\nSquadron, 7th Cavalry, was to land on the right flank of White Beach,\r\npush inland, capture San Jose and a bridge across the Burayan River\r\nnorthwest of the town, and seize a beachhead line a thousand yards\r\nwest of Highway 1 and three thousand yards from White Beach. The\r\nCataisan Peninsula would then be sealed off.\r\n\r\nBoth squadrons landed on schedule, with only slight opposition,\r\nand immediately began to execute their assignments. The 2d Squadron,\r\nwithin fifteen minutes after landing, knocked out two pillboxes on the\r\nbeach, killing eight Japanese in one and five in the other. It then\r\norganized rapidly and pushed on to secure its first objective, the\r\ntown of San Jose. In the town the squadron engaged in a house-to-house\r\nsearch but found few Japanese. By 1230 twenty-four Japanese had been\r\nkilled, San Jose was in American hands, and the Cataisan Peninsula\r\nwas sealed off. The 7th Cavalry Regiment established its command post\r\non the west side of the town at 1245. The troops of the 2d Squadron\r\nthen set out in a northwesterly direction astride the hard-surfaced,\r\nnarrow San Jose-Tacloban road, but they were slowed down by swamps\r\nand flooded rice paddies on either side. [230] At 1400 they crossed\r\nthe Burayan River on a bridge which the 33d Infantry Regiment had\r\nattempted to destroy but had only damaged. The engineers strengthened\r\nthe bridge so that the medium tanks could cross, and at 1420 the\r\nforward movement continued. By 1630 the squadron had reached its\r\nobjective--a point 3,000 yards from White Beach--and immediately set\r\nup its night perimeter.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry, landed in amphibian tractors on the\r\nnorth end of White Beach a few minutes after initial assault waves of\r\nthe 2d Squadron, 7th Cavalry, had cleared the beach. It moved west off\r\nthe beach 100 yards, pivoted to the right, and began to move up the\r\nCataisan Peninsula. The squadron was expected to secure the peninsula\r\nand the airstrip with great speed. Engineer units had landed just\r\nbehind it and were waiting to start work on the airstrip as soon as\r\nit was seized. The 1st Squadron met with only light enemy opposition,\r\nthe chief obstacles being the swamps, unoccupied pillboxes--each\r\nof which had to be checked--and the numerous Filipino shacks that\r\nafforded possible protection to the enemy. By 1600 the squadron had\r\nsecured the airstrip and the Cataisan Peninsula. [231] Later in the\r\nafternoon the squadron, less Troop A, was withdrawn from the peninsula.\r\n\r\nThe 5th and 12th Cavalry Regiments landed on White Beach without\r\nincident at exactly 1000. Immediately beyond the narrow landing\r\nbeach was a deep swamp through which the regiments must move to reach\r\nHighway 1. The morass was often waist deep, in places even up to the\r\narmpits, and men of the advancing line of troops cursed heartily as\r\nthey floundered toward the highway. [232] Under such circumstances it\r\nwas impossible for the men to carry all of their personal equipment,\r\nand they had to make three trips in order to complete the crossing of\r\ncertain areas. At 1100 a reconnaissance platoon of the 5th Cavalry\r\nRegiment made physical contact with elements of the 34th Infantry,\r\n24th Division, on its left. By 1500 both cavalry regiments were\r\non Highway 1. They pushed westward immediately toward the next\r\nobjective--the foothills west of the highway. [233] Col. Royce\r\nE. Drake, the commanding officer of the 5th Cavalry Regiment, went\r\nforward with a patrol from F Troop. At 1900, about three quarters of\r\na mile south of Caibaan, the patrol made contact with the enemy. In\r\nthe ensuing fight ten Japanese and one American were killed and two\r\nAmericans wounded. At 1915 the 12th Cavalry Regiment closed in on\r\nits A-Day objective and formed its night perimeter. [234] The 5th\r\nCavalry Regiment formed its night perimeter at 2135, a few hundred\r\nyards short of the objective. [235]\r\n\r\nThe first elements of the 8th Cavalry Regiment, 2d Cavalry Brigade,\r\nthe corps reserve, moved to White Beach at 1040, and by 1130 the entire\r\nreserve regiment was ashore. The regiment continued in corps reserve\r\nthroughout the day and spent its first night in the Philippines on\r\nthe western edge of San Jose. [236]\r\n\r\nAt 1400 General Mudge assumed command ashore of the 1st Cavalry\r\nDivision and by 1630 had established the divisional command post\r\nat San Jose. [237] Preceded by a ground reconnaissance of the unit\r\ncommanders, all of the 1st Cavalry Division artillery landed on White\r\nBeach at 1330 and immediately established a position in the vicinity\r\nof San Jose. Before nightfall all battalions had registered and were\r\nprepared to fire, and beginning at 2115 the 61st Field Artillery\r\nBattalion throughout the night delivered harassing fire on the\r\nhills south of Tacloban. [238] By the end of the day the division\r\nhad secured the Cataisan Peninsula and the Tacloban airstrip and,\r\nafter crossing Highway 1, had made physical contact with the right\r\nflank of the 24th Infantry Division. [239]\r\n\r\n24th Infantry Division [240]\r\n\r\nIn the southern part of the X Corps zone, to the left of the 1st\r\nCavalry Division, the 24th Infantry Division (less the 21st Infantry),\r\nunder Maj. Gen. Frederick A. Irving, was to land on Red Beach on the\r\nmorning of A Day. [241] Although there were no underwater obstacles,\r\nmines, or barbed wire along Red Beach, the water was too shallow to\r\npermit vessels the size of LST's to come in and make a dry landing. Red\r\nBeach was narrow but consisted of firm sand. Back of it was flat,\r\nmarshy ground covered with palm trees and jungle growth, extending\r\ninland in a southwesterly direction from the northern end of the\r\nbeach. General Makino had converted a small stream bed in this area\r\ninto a wide and deep tank trap which paralleled the beach for 1,500\r\nyards. Several large, well-camouflaged pillboxes, connected by tunnels\r\nand constructed of palm logs and earth, were scattered throughout the\r\narea. Between the swamp and a low range of hills one and a quarter\r\nmiles inland were open fields and rice paddies. The most prominent\r\nterrain feature was Hill 522 just north of Palo. This hill commanded\r\nthe beach area, the town of Palo, and Highway 2, leading into the\r\ninterior. It was partly wooded, and the 33d Infantry Regiment had\r\ninterlaced it with tunnels, trenches, and pillboxes.\r\n\r\nFrom the beach a single deeply rutted and muddy exit road ran south\r\nto the Palo River, where it turned westward to Highway 1. The river\r\nwas just north of the town of Palo and roughly paralleled Highway 2,\r\nwhich ran in a northwesterly direction from Palo into the interior,\r\nbetween the hills dominating this entrance to Leyte Valley.\r\n\r\nThe 24th Division was to occupy Palo, advance with regiments abreast\r\ninto the interior in a northwesterly direction, [242] occupy the\r\nCapoocan-Carigara-Barugo area, and secure Highway 1 between Palo and\r\nTanauan. The 19th Infantry on the left (south) was to establish an\r\ninitial beachhead, advance to the west and south, seize Hill 522,\r\nand move on and capture Palo. The 34th Infantry on the right (north)\r\nwas to establish an initial beachhead, then move westward into the\r\ninterior and be prepared to assist the 19th Infantry in the capture\r\nof Hill 522. [243]\r\n\r\nThe assaulting forces, having been transferred to landing craft,\r\nmet at the line of departure 5,000 yards from shore. After grouping,\r\nthey dashed for the landing beaches, each regiment in column of\r\nbattalions. The division landed at 1000 with regiments abreast\r\naccording to plan. The Japanese allowed the first five waves to land,\r\nbut when the other waves were 3,000 to 2,000 yards offshore, they\r\nopened strong artillery and mortar fire against them. [244] A number\r\nof the landing craft carrying the 1st Battalion, 19th Infantry,\r\nwere hit and four of them sunk. There were numerous casualties:\r\nthe commanding officer of Company C was killed; a squad of the\r\nAmmunition and Pioneer Platoon was almost wiped out; and the Cannon\r\nCompany suffered the loss of two section leaders, a platoon leader,\r\nand part of its headquarters personnel.\r\n\r\nAmong the vessels hit by Japanese artillery were four LST's, one of\r\nwhich was set on fire. Of the five remaining, two were driven away\r\nand three did not get in until much later. The enemy fired upon the\r\nretiring LST's, which carried with them the artillery and most of\r\nthe tanks. The commanding officer of Headquarters Company and the\r\ndivision quartermaster, together with the latter's executive officer,\r\nwere wounded. Many of the division headquarters personnel were killed\r\nor wounded.\r\n\r\nThe first elements of the 3d Battalion, 34th Infantry, inadvertently\r\nlanded 300 yards north of the assigned area and were immediately pinned\r\ndown by heavy machine gun and rifle fire. The commanding officer of\r\nthe regiment, Col. Aubrey S. Newman, arrived on the beach and, noting\r\nthe situation, shouted to his men, \"Get the hell off the beach. Get\r\nup and get moving. Follow me.\" [245] Thus urgently prompted, the men\r\nfollowed him into the wooded area.\r\n\r\nCompany I was able to advance, but Company K ran into a defensive\r\nposition of five pillboxes along a stream about seventy-five\r\nyards from the beach. It successfully stormed these pillboxes with\r\nrifles, BAR's, and hand grenades. The 3d Battalion then halted for\r\nreorganization. Company L, the reserve company, moved into the line\r\nsouth of Company K to close the gap between the 19th and 34th Infantry\r\nRegiments, a gap created when part of the 34th landed too far north.\r\n\r\nBy 1215 the 34th Infantry had cleared the beach area of the enemy,\r\nand the 3d Battalion was ready to advance across an open swamp\r\nto a line of trees 150 yards away. A preparatory concentration by\r\n81-mm. mortars, tanks, and heavy machine guns was first laid down. At\r\n1230 the 3d Battalion moved in. Although the going was rough and the\r\nmud waist deep, the troops reached the trees at 1300 and waited for\r\nthe mortars and machine guns to arrive. The 3d Battalion then pushed\r\non an additional 250 yards.\r\n\r\nThe 2d Battalion, 34th Infantry, passed through the 3d Battalion,\r\ncrossed Highway 1 at 1550, and dug in for the night 100 yards west\r\nof the highway. [246]\r\n\r\nThe 34th Infantry established contact with the 1st Cavalry Division\r\non the right and the 19th Infantry on the left. The 1st Battalion,\r\n34th Infantry, remained in the beachhead area.\r\n\r\nTo the south the 19th Infantry, with the 3d Battalion in the lead,\r\nhad also struck heavy opposition on its sector of the beach. Through\r\nerror the first waves of the regiment landed almost directly behind the\r\n34th Infantry and 800 yards north of the proposed landing point. The\r\nlater waves landed at the planned spot.\r\n\r\nCompany K did not land on schedule, because its command boat broke\r\ndown. Going in under heavy fire, the company had all its officers\r\nexcept one killed or wounded. One of its platoons was unable to make\r\ncontact with the rest of the company until the following day.\r\n\r\nCompany L, on the right, met little opposition on landing, established\r\ncontact with the 34th Infantry, and reached the initial phase line\r\n500 yards in from the beach. Company I, on the left, encountered\r\nstiff resistance fifty yards off the beach. The defenses of the 33d\r\nInfantry Regiment in this sector consisted of a tank ditch and light\r\nautomatic weapons, mortars, 75-mm. guns, and light and heavy machine\r\nguns in prepared positions. Company I hit a group of pillboxes and\r\nknocked out several of them as well as a 75-mm. gun. In this action\r\nPfc. Frank B. Robinson played a spectacular role. Crawling behind a\r\npillbox, he dropped three grenades into it and then reached down and\r\npulled the machine gun barrel out of line. After a further advance of\r\n200 yards, when a flame thrower aimed at a pillbox failed to ignite,\r\nhe threw a bundle of lighted papers in front of the pillbox. The\r\noperator of the flame thrower then fired through the blaze and the\r\ncharge was ignited. By openly exposing himself to fire from a third\r\npillbox, Robinson enabled tanks to locate its position. [247]\r\n\r\nDuring the next few hours platoons and squads fought independently. The\r\n3d Battalion, 19th Infantry, drove into the interior about 500 yards,\r\nwhere it reorganized, made contact with adjacent units, and then\r\nestablished its perimeter on Highway 1. [248]\r\n\r\nThe 1st Battalion, 19th Infantry, had come in under intense fire in\r\nwhich several boats were hit, and numerous casualties occurred. The\r\nbattalion landed 300 yards north of its selected area, moved in\r\n200 yards, and then made a left, oblique turn in order to reach its\r\npredetermined assembly area. Company B suffered several casualties\r\nwhen it ran into strong rifle and pillbox fire, which pinned it\r\ndown. The company was ordered to break off fighting and move to\r\nthe northern edge of the Japanese positions. Lt. Col. Frederick\r\nR. Zierath, the commanding officer of the battalion, ordered the\r\nself-propelled guns to be brought up. They successfully neutralized\r\nthe pillbox and a supporting position behind it. Company C, landing\r\non the left flank of the battalion, was immediately pinned down by\r\nhostile fire. Zierath ordered it to disengage and proceed to the\r\ndesignated assembly area. Company A, which was split by enemy fire,\r\nregrouped inland and reached the assembly area just ahead of Company C.\r\n\r\nThe 2d Battalion, 19th Infantry, arrived at the beach just as the 1st\r\nBattalion was bypassing the initial resistance. By noon its first\r\ndefense was formed around the beachhead. At 1245 Company E, with a\r\nrocket launcher, silenced a 75-mm. gun which had been firing on the\r\nLST's. In its advance the company located two more 75-mm. guns which\r\nhad been abandoned. Company G relieved Company E and prepared to move\r\nalong the beach road southwest toward Palo. As the point started to\r\nmove out at 1300 it was attacked by approximately a platoon from the\r\n33d Infantry Regiment which attempted to retake the gun positions. The\r\nJapanese were repulsed by rifle fire, leaving eleven dead.\r\n\r\nAt 1430 Company G, in resuming its advance, ran at once into a series\r\nof mutually supporting pillboxes about 500 yards inland, where the\r\nbeach road turns to meet Highway 1. A stiff rifle fire fight followed,\r\nin which the Americans suffered fifteen casualties. Since darkness\r\nwas approaching, the battalion broke off the action and dug in along\r\nthe road for the night.\r\n\r\nWhile the 2d Battalion, 19th Infantry, was proceeding cautiously\r\nforward the 1st Battalion was working toward Hill 522. This hill,\r\nwhich rose directly from the river's edge north of Palo, overlooked the\r\nlanding beaches and its upward trails were steep and winding. Hill 522\r\npresented the most significant terrain feature which would have to be\r\novercome before the American forces could push into the interior from\r\nPalo and it constituted one of the chief objectives for A Day. Three\r\nmonths earlier General Makino had started to fortify it, impressing\r\nnearly all of the male population of Palo for the work. By A Day they\r\nhad constructed five well-camouflaged pillboxes of rocks, planking,\r\nand logs, covered with earth. Numerous tunnels honeycombed the hill;\r\nthe communications trenches were seven feet deep.\r\n\r\nDuring the preliminary bombardments the Navy had delivered some of\r\nits heaviest blows on the hill, and the bombardment was continued\r\nby Battery B of the 13th Field Artillery Battalion and Battery A\r\nof the 63d Field Artillery Battalion. The 1st Battalion of the 19th\r\nInfantry sent reconnaissance parties to locate a northern route to\r\nthe hill. The plan had been to move inland from the extreme south of\r\nthe beachhead, but that area was still in Japanese hands. At 1430,\r\nwhen scouts reported finding a covered route on the northern side\r\nof the hill, the 1st Battalion immediately moved out in a column of\r\ncompanies. The column had barely started when Company A, in the lead,\r\nwas held up by enemy fire from the five pillboxes. The remainder of\r\nthe battalion moved north around Company A, and, skirting the woods,\r\nattacked Hill 522 from the northeast, with Company C on the right\r\nand Company B on the left.\r\n\r\nThe men, although tired from the day's activity and strain, made steady\r\nprogress up the slope. As the troops moved upward, American mortars\r\nstarted to shell the crest of the hill. It was thought that this was\r\nartillery fire and a request was made that it be lifted. It came,\r\nhowever, from the chemical mortars. After a short delay the firing\r\nceased. At dusk Company B reached the first crest of the hill and was\r\nhalted by fire from two enemy bunkers. The company thereupon dug in.\r\n\r\nAt the same time scouts from Company C reached the central and\r\nhighest crest of the hill and espied about two platoons of Japanese\r\ncoming up the other side. They shouted for the remainder of the\r\ncompany to hurry. Company C got to the top of the hill barely ahead\r\nof the Japanese, and a sharp engagement took place in which about\r\nfifty Japanese were killed. Company C held the highest crest of the\r\nhill. During this attack, 1st Lt. Dallas Dick was struck in the leg\r\nand his carbine was shot from his hands, but he continued to command\r\nhis unit until his evacuation forty-eight hours later.\r\n\r\nDuring the night the Japanese made frequent but unsuccessful attempts\r\nto infiltrate the company area and in the darkness they carried\r\naway their dead and wounded. During the action to secure Hill 522,\r\nfourteen men of the 1st Battalion were killed and ninety-five wounded;\r\nthirty of the latter eventually rejoined their units. General Irving,\r\nwho had assumed command of the 24th Division ashore at 1420, later\r\nsaid that if Hill 522 had not been secured when it was, the Americans\r\nmight have suffered a thousand casualties in the assault.\r\n\r\nBy the end of A Day, the division had crossed Highway 1 and established\r\nphysical contact with the 1st Cavalry Division on its right flank. In\r\nspite of strong opposition on its left flank, the 24th Division\r\nhad secured Hill 522, which dominated the route into the interior\r\nand overlooked the town of Palo, the entrance point into Leyte\r\nValley. Furthermore, the X Corps had now secured a firm beachhead\r\narea averaging a mile in depth and extending over five miles from\r\nthe tip of the Cataisan Peninsula to the vicinity of Palo, and had\r\ncaptured the important Tacloban airstrip on the Cataisan Peninsula.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV Corps Goes Ashore\r\n\r\nWhile the X Corps was engaged in seizing a beachhead and capturing\r\nthe Tacloban airfield, the XXIV Corps was carrying out its mission\r\nmore than fourteen miles to the south. (Map 6) It was to land in\r\nthe Dulag-San Jose area and establish a beachhead between Dulag and\r\nTanauan. The Dulag airstrip was the primary objective. The 7th and\r\n96th Divisions--the 7th on the left (south) and the 96th on the right\r\n(north)--made the landings. The most prominent terrain feature near\r\nthe shore line is a short, finger-like hill range between the mouth\r\nof the Labiranan River and the village of Pikas. Ranging from 400\r\nfeet at its southern extremity, known as Labiranan Head, to 1400\r\nfeet at Catmon Hill, southeast of Pikas, this hill mass dominates\r\nthe surrounding plain for miles around. (The entire hill mass will\r\nhereafter be referred to as Catmon Hill.)\r\n\r\nThe 9th Infantry Regiment, less one battalion, was guarding the\r\nCatmon Hill area while the 20th Infantry Regiment, less one battalion,\r\nwas defending the Dulag area. [249]\r\n\r\nImmediately northwest of Dulag and just off the beach was a swamp,\r\n[250] and along the coast were coconut groves interspersed with rice\r\nfields. Many streams and rivers cut across the coastal plain. [251]\r\nBetween Dulag and Labiranan Head was a good section of firm sand beach,\r\nbacked by a broad alluvial plain extending ten miles inland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n96th Infantry Division\r\n\r\nIn the early morning hours of 20 October the Southern Attack Force\r\nmoved to a location off the shores of Leyte near the town of Dulag. The\r\n96th Division was to land with regiments abreast in the area between\r\nthe Calbasag River and the town of San Jose--the 382d Infantry on\r\nthe left (south) and the 383d Infantry on the right (north). The\r\nsouthern half of the division's beachhead area was designated Blue\r\nBeaches 1 and 2, and the northern half was known as Orange Beaches\r\n1 and 2. The beaches had an average length of about 525 yards. The\r\nnorthern extremity of Orange Beach was about ten miles from the\r\nsouthernmost beach of the 24th Division in the X Corps sector.\r\n\r\nThe order to \"land the landing force\" of the 96th Division came at\r\n0845, and LVT's immediately began to spill out of the LST's and head\r\nfor the line of departure. By 0930 the assault waves, preceded by the\r\namphibian tank wave, had arrived at their appointed position 4,500\r\nyards offshore. [252] At the head of the column were LCI gunboats\r\nwhich were to give fire support and act as guides for succeeding\r\nwaves. The assault waves then headed for Blue and Orange Beaches.\r\n\r\nWhen the landing craft were within 100 yards of the shore, the\r\nLCI's fired into the interior and to each side of the landing\r\nbeaches. Thereupon the amphibian tanks began to fire directly beyond\r\nthe beaches, in front of the advancing assault forces. The 382d\r\nInfantry under Col. Macey L. Dill landed at 0950 on Blue Beach, and\r\nthe 383d Infantry under Col. Edwin T. May landed ten minutes later\r\non Orange Beach.\r\n\r\nThe 383d Infantry landed with two battalions abreast--the 2d\r\nBattalion on the left and the 1st Battalion on the right. By 1045 both\r\nbattalions had landed all of their assault troops and had advanced\r\n1,200 yards inland, encountering no resistance except intermittent\r\nmortar fire from the 9th Infantry Regiment in the vicinity of Catmon\r\nHill. [253] Immediately beyond the highway the two battalions reached\r\nan unsuspected swamp. The amphibian tanks bogged down at 1045 and\r\nwere unable to catch up with the assault troops during the rest of\r\nthe day. Intermittent Japanese fire continued to fall on the beach\r\narea. The 2d Battalion crossed the swamp without encountering the\r\nenemy and established its night perimeter 2,600 yards inland from\r\nthe landing beaches.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Battalion, 383d Infantry, pushed northwest through the barrio\r\nof San Jose, which was on the beach, and along the marshy ground and\r\nswamps on the south bank of the Labiranan River for 2,200 yards. It\r\ncrossed the river at 1610. Company C placed a roadblock at the point\r\nwhere Highway 1 crossed the Labiranan River. After advancing 400 yards\r\nfarther northwest the battalion ran into fire from elements of the\r\n9th Infantry Regiment. At 1900 the battalion, still under enemy fire,\r\ndug in for the night. At the close of the day's action it was at the\r\nbase of Labiranan Head in a position which would permit an attack to\r\nbe launched on that terrain feature from the west.\r\n\r\nThe 3d Battalion, which had been held afloat in regimental reserve,\r\ncame ashore at 1045. It mopped up in the rear of the 1st and 2d\r\nBattalions and established its night perimeter 800 yards away from the\r\n1st Battalion on the south bank of the Labiranan River. During the\r\nday the 383d Infantry Regiment, slowed by the terrain, had advanced\r\n2,600 yards inland. [254]\r\n\r\nAs heavy enemy artillery and mortar fire fell on the beach, the 382d\r\nInfantry also landed with two battalions abreast--the 2d Battalion\r\nto the right (north) at Blue Beach 2 and the 3d Battalion to the left\r\n(south) at Blue Beach 1. The 2d Battalion, though momentarily stopped\r\nby debris on the shore, was able to advance quickly and by 1025 had\r\npenetrated 300 yards inland. This gain was increased to 700 yards\r\nby 1115. The battalion crossed Highway 1 before it encountered the\r\nfirst defensive positions of the 9th Infantry Regiment, a series\r\nof zigzag deserted trenches roughly paralleling the beach. Although\r\nthe 2d Battalion met no enemy opposition, the intense heat and the\r\nswampy ground made progress slow. At 1630, when the battalion formed\r\na perimeter for the night, it had pushed inland approximately 2,500\r\nyards.\r\n\r\nThe amphibian tractors carrying the 3d Battalion, 382d Infantry, were\r\nheld up by the tank barriers of coconut logs and debris on the beach,\r\nand the troops were forced to debark at the water's edge. Several\r\nhundred yards off the beach this battalion began to receive heavy\r\nfire from Hill 120, which was about 600 yards from the beach. The\r\nhill dominated the regimental beach area [255] and was the A-Day\r\nobjective for the battalion. The fire pinned down the battalion,\r\nwhich thereupon called for mortar support and naval gunfire. The\r\nresulting barrage forced the Japanese out of their positions, and at\r\n1040 the battalion advanced and captured Hill 120.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Battalion, 382d Infantry, which had been in floating reserve,\r\nlanded on Blue Beach 1 and moved to the foot of Hill 120 to support\r\nthe 3d Battalion. Immediately beyond the hill there was a small meadow\r\nrimmed by a deep swamp. The enemy fired upon the hill throughout the\r\nday but could not dislodge the 3d Battalion. This steady fire and the\r\npresence of the swamp limited the A-Day advance of the 3d Battalion\r\nto 1,300 yards inland from the landing beach.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, despite the swampy terrain and the harassing\r\nfire of the Japanese, the 382d Infantry had advanced approximately\r\n2,500 yards on the northern flank and 1,300 yards on the southern\r\nflank. Contact had been established at 1600 with the 32d Infantry,\r\n7th Division, on the left flank, and the 383d Infantry, 96th Division,\r\non the right flank. [256]\r\n\r\nAt 1630 the assault forces of the 96th Division consolidated their\r\npositions and set up defense perimeters for the night. During the\r\nday the division had captured the barrio of San Jose, established\r\ncontrol over both sides of the Labiranan River, captured Hill 120\r\noverlooking the beach area, and progressed well inland. Although all\r\nunits of the division fell considerably short of the objective for\r\nA Day, this delay was due fully as much to the swampy and difficult\r\nterrain as it was to enemy resistance. The 381st Infantry Regiment\r\nremained in Sixth Army floating reserve throughout the day. [257]\r\n\r\nMaj. Gen. James L. Bradley arrived ashore at 1750, and at 1800\r\nhe assumed command of the 96th Infantry Division. The three light\r\nartillery battalions of the division had landed and were in position\r\nby 1800.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7th Infantry Division\r\n\r\nConcurrently with the landings of the 96th Division, the 7th Division,\r\non the left, was establishing a beachhead in its zone of action\r\njust south of the 96th Division. At 0800 the assault troops of the\r\n7th Division began to clamber down the nets of their transports into\r\nlanding boats which were to carry them in the dash for the shore. [258]\r\nBy 0815 they were boated and at the line of departure.\r\n\r\nThe 7th Division was to land on Violet and Yellow Beaches. Violet Beach\r\nextended 785 yards north from the northern edge of Dulag. The northern\r\nhalf of Yellow Beach, called Yellow Beach 2, which was south of Violet\r\nBeach and contiguous to it, was 400 yards long. Between the northern\r\nand southern halves of Yellow Beach was a swamp. The southern half of\r\nYellow Beach, Yellow Beach 1, was approximately 425 yards in length\r\nand was located south of Dulag and north of the Daguitan River mouth.\r\n\r\nThe 7th Division was to go ashore between the Calbasag and Daguitan\r\nRivers with regiments abreast--the 32d Infantry on the right (north)\r\nand the 184th Infantry on the left (south); the 17th Infantry, less\r\nits 3d Battalion, was in reserve. The principal A-Day objectives\r\nwere the barrio of Dulag and its airstrip. The 3d Battalion, 17th\r\nInfantry, was to swing south and secure the bridge and the crossing\r\nof the Daguitan River at Dao and the crossing of the Talisay River.\r\n\r\nThe 32d Infantry, under Col. Marc J. Logie, was to land on the northern\r\nand southern portions of Violet Beach, drive into the interior,\r\nand protect the right flank of the division. The 184th Infantry,\r\ncommanded by Col. Curtis D. O'Sullivan, was to land on Yellow Beach 1\r\nand Yellow Beach 2 and then drive inland, directing its main effort\r\ntoward an early seizure of the airfield west of Dulag. It was also\r\nto seize and secure the crossings of the Daguitan River.\r\n\r\nAfter the landing waves had formed at the line of departure, the\r\nlanding craft started for the beaches, preceded by the 776th Amphibian\r\nTank Battalion. As it got ashore, the tank battalion received hostile\r\nmortar and small arms fire that came from a tank barrier of coconut\r\npalm logs near the water's edge. The battalion overcame this opposition\r\nfifteen minutes after landing and advanced a distance of 200 yards\r\ninland to positions from which it could support the infantry. [259]\r\nAccording to plan, the 32d and 184th Infantry Regiments followed\r\nabreast. The 32d Infantry landed with two battalions abreast--the 2d\r\non the right and the 3d on the left. The regiment encountered minor\r\nresistance at the beach, consisting of light rifle fire and sporadic\r\nartillery and mortar fire. By 1023 the 3d Battalion had landed all its\r\nassault troops and by 1030 seven assault waves of the 2d Battalion\r\nhad reached the shore. As the two battalions proceeded inland, they\r\nmet opposition from the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe 2d Battalion landed on the edge of a cemetery in which were small\r\ngroups of the enemy very much alive. By 1100 these were subdued by\r\nrifle fire and the battalion was able to advance without difficulty\r\ninto the interior. At about 1300 the 2d Platoon of Company F, after\r\nadvancing some 600 yards, ran into fire from three pillboxes concealed\r\nin the tall cogon grass on the right flank. Tanks were brought up to\r\nknock out the enemy pillboxes. The advance then continued. By 1315\r\nthe 2d Battalion made physical contact with elements of the 96th\r\nDivision on the right. Shortly after 1400 the 2d and 3d Battalions\r\nof the 32d Infantry made contact and reached Highway 1. [260]\r\n\r\nCompanies L and K of the 3d Battalion, 32d Infantry, landed\r\nabreast. Company L, on the left, ran into heavy fire from Japanese\r\nmachine gunners who had waited until the leading elements of the\r\ncompany exposed themselves. The Japanese were entrenched in bunkers\r\nemplaced in hedgerows and banana groves. The pillboxes, which were\r\nmutually supporting, were located at the ends of the hedgerows and\r\noccasionally in the middle of an open field. Each pillbox had machine\r\nguns and antitank guns. Company L suffered a number of casualties\r\nand was pinned down. The enemy gunners then turned to Company K and\r\nstopped its forward movement. In the space of fifteen minutes two\r\nofficers and six men of the 3d Battalion were killed, and one officer\r\nand eighteen men wounded. Of the medium tanks that had come ashore at\r\n1030, three were sent to support Company L and two to support Company\r\nK. The latter two were knocked out before they could adjust their\r\nfire on the pillboxes. The leading tank sent in support of Company L\r\nwas knocked out by a direct hit from an antitank gun. With two tanks\r\nremaining, it was decided to hit the flanks of the entrenched pillboxes\r\nat 1345. A platoon of Company K went to the right and another platoon\r\nfrom the company to the left. Simultaneously the remaining elements\r\nof the two companies, coordinating with the tanks, assaulted the\r\npillboxes. The heavy volume of fire kept the enemy guns quiet until\r\nthey could be finished off with grenades. The pillboxes were knocked\r\nout without further casualties.\r\n\r\nParalleling the route of advance of Company L were several hedge\r\nfences, behind which were enemy machine guns and mortars. Although\r\nunder heavy fire, the company was able to break through the first\r\nbarriers with the aid of the tanks. At 1630, since the enemy fire\r\ncontinued in volume, the 32d Infantry withdrew and established a\r\ndefensive position for the night. During the day the 32d Infantry had\r\nreached a general line along Highway 1. The 2d Battalion had advanced\r\n400 yards beyond the highway and the 3d Battalion 100 yards. [261]\r\n\r\nThe 184th Infantry landed at 1000, two battalions abreast--the 1st\r\non the southern half of Yellow Beach and the 3d on the northern\r\nhalf. They encountered surprisingly little resistance on either\r\nbeach and were able to push inland at a much greater speed than had\r\nbeen anticipated. The 3d Battalion drove through the town of Dulag,\r\nwhich lay directly in its path, to the Dulag-Burauen Highway. The 1st\r\nBattalion pushed inland and reached the highway at 1210, just fifteen\r\nminutes after the 3d Battalion. At 1530 the two battalions established\r\nphysical contact and maintained it throughout the day as they continued\r\ntheir advance along the highway. At 1255 the 2d Battalion, 184th\r\nInfantry, landed on Yellow Beach and went into regimental reserve on\r\nthe regiment's southern flank. As the advance of the 32d Infantry on\r\nthe right slowed up, Company G, 184th Infantry, was committed to fill\r\nthe gap which had developed between the two regiments. At 1835 the\r\n184th Infantry, although it had failed to secure the Dulag airstrip,\r\nformed its night perimeter along the edge of the strip. [262] At the\r\nend of the day the regiment had no battle casualties, but three men\r\nhad been overcome by the heat. Eleven Japanese had been killed in\r\nthe regiment's zone. [263]\r\n\r\nThe 17th Infantry, less its 3d Battalion, was kept in 7th Division\r\nreserve. The 3d Battalion of the 17th had come ashore at 1500 on the\r\nsouthern end of Yellow Beach. The battalion pushed west and south\r\nthrough light opposition, seizing the bridge over the Daguitan River\r\nat Dao, and by 2100 had established a bridgehead south of the river\r\nand made contact with the 184th Infantry on the right. At the end of\r\nthe first day's fighting the 7th Division had gained possession of the\r\nLeyte shore in its zone and penetrated inland 600 yards on the right\r\nand nearly 2,300 yards on the left. It had also reached the edge of\r\nthe Dulag airstrip. By nightfall the XXIV Corps had established a\r\nfirm beachhead line extending along the coast from San Jose on the\r\nnorth to just below Dao on the south.\r\n\r\nSeventy miles to the south the 21st Infantry Regiment of the 24th\r\nDivision, which was detailed to land in the vicinity of Panaon Strait\r\non 20 October at 0930, half an hour before the launching of the\r\ngreat offensive, and to secure control of that entrance to Sogod Bay,\r\nsuccessfully accomplished its mission. It encountered no Japanese.\r\n\r\nThus at the end of A Day the Sixth Army had succeeded in landing\r\nassault forces all along the eastern coast of Leyte and was in\r\ncontrol of Panaon Strait. Its casualties amounted to 49 men killed,\r\n192 wounded, and 6 missing in action. There remained a gap of nearly\r\nten miles between the X and XXIV Corps. The Tacloban airstrip on the\r\nCataisan Peninsula had been secured and the American forces were\r\non the edge of the airstrip at Dulag. Nearly as important as the\r\ncapture of the airstrip was the seizure of Hill 522, which commanded\r\nthe entrance to the broad Leyte Valley at Palo. The advance echelon\r\nof General Headquarters had opened on Leyte Island at 1200. [264]\r\nOn the following day, when adequate communication facilities had\r\nbeen established, Generals Krueger, Sibert, and Hodge assumed command\r\nashore of the Sixth Army, X Corps, and XXIV Corps, respectively.\r\n\r\nMost of the 16th Division had withdrawn during the naval and air\r\nbombardment which took place just prior to the landing. The immediate\r\ninvasion of the troops after this pounding enabled the Americans to\r\nsecure most of the coastal defenses before the enemy could regroup\r\nand return. As a consequence, the only Japanese forces encountered\r\nwere those left behind to fight a delaying action. The meeting with\r\nthe enemy in force was yet to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBringing in Supplies\r\n\r\nWhile the assault forces were securing the beaches of Leyte, supplies\r\nwere being poured in to support the operation. Within an hour after\r\nthe first assault wave hit the hostile shores, rations, equipment,\r\nand other supplies were being rushed to the beaches. Each man going\r\nashore carried a change of clothing in his pack, two days' supply\r\nof emergency rations, one day's supply of D rations, and two filled\r\ncanteens, in addition to his gas mask, weapons, and ammunition.\r\n\r\nThe Navy was responsible for transporting the troops and supplies to\r\nthe target area. Ships' companies unloaded the cargo from the cargo\r\nvessels and transported it in small craft to the beaches. Many of\r\nthe ships had been improperly loaded for the journey to Leyte. The\r\ncargo should have been so loaded that articles first needed would\r\nbe the last put on board; instead it had been stowed haphazardly,\r\nwith little attention given to the problem of unloading.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the faulty stowage of supplies on the ships, many\r\nbadly needed items were at the bottoms of the holds, and articles\r\nthat would not be needed until later in the operation were piled\r\non top of them. The supplies were set ashore in random fashion and\r\nthen were carelessly thrown on trucks and other vehicles. This sort\r\nof handling resulted in a loss of carrying capacity, in slow removal\r\nof the loads, and in a consequent delay in the return of vehicles to\r\nthe landing beaches.\r\n\r\nThe LSM's were used to very good advantage in the unloading of\r\nthe APA's and AKA's. Vehicles and supplies could be loaded on them\r\nwithout difficulty, and in addition, two hatches on the LSM's could\r\nbe worked at the same time. On each of the APA's, AKA's, and LST's\r\nwhich carried troops, a labor crew was detailed to remain on board\r\nto assist in the unloading. [265]\r\n\r\nAt the beach, the Army took over the cargo and moved the supplies\r\nto prearranged dumps. On the northern beaches in the X Corps sector,\r\nthe Army shore party was composed of the 532d and 592d Engineer Boat\r\nand Shore Regiments of the 2d Engineer Special Brigade. After landing,\r\nthese units facilitated the movement of troops, vehicles, and supplies\r\nacross the beaches and controlled all unloading operations. [266]\r\nThe 1122d and 1140th Engineer Combat Groups supervised the unloading\r\nin the XXIV Corps sector. They were assisted by naval beach parties\r\nfrom the VII Amphibious Force, which brought the cargo ashore.\r\n\r\nThe beachhead areas at which the supplies were unloaded varied in\r\nquality and depth. Most of the beaches on which the 7th and 96th\r\nDivisions landed were very good, [267] as contrasted with those in the\r\nX Corps area where the 24th Infantry Division and 1st Cavalry Division\r\ncame ashore. The greatest difficulty was encountered along Red Beach,\r\nwhere the 24th Division landed. This stretch of coast line was ill\r\nadapted to the unloading of supplies, having poor exits and offering\r\nfew dispersal areas ashore. [268]\r\n\r\nLST's approaching Red Beach were under intense enemy fire. Four of them\r\nreceived direct hits. [269] Nearly all of the LST's were grounded 100\r\nto 200 yards from the beach. Only one of them was able to come within\r\nforty to fifty yards of the beach, and it succeeded in unloading its\r\ncargo of heavy equipment only with considerable difficulty. [270]\r\nAnother put off a bulldozer, which disappeared in seven feet of\r\nwater. With difficulty the other LST's withdrew and returned to the\r\ntransport area. [271]\r\n\r\nThe shore parties on both Red and White Beaches (X Corps sector)\r\ndid not land early enough to effect a proper organization before the\r\ncargo began to come in. Although the parties worked hard, they were\r\nundermanned, and it was necessary to augment them by \"volunteers\" in\r\norder to unload the large volume of cargo. [272] It had been planned\r\nto establish temporary beach dumps at the point of unloading of\r\neach LST, but since at Red Beach the LST's could not get ashore, the\r\nplans had to be changed. These craft were diverted to the 1st Cavalry\r\nDivision's White Beach 2,000 yards north. The LSM's and LCM's were\r\nable to discharge their vehicles in three or four feet of water. Many\r\nof these, being poorly waterproofed, stalled and had to be pulled\r\nashore. Once there, the heavily loaded vehicles churned up the sand,\r\nand many of them sank so deeply that they had to be pulled out. [273]\r\n\r\nThe strong resistance of the Japanese and the difficult terrain\r\nlimited the depth of the 24th Division's beachhead and prevented\r\nthe establishment of division dumps beyond the beachhead areas. As a\r\nresult, most of the supplies and nearly all supporting and service\r\ntroops had to be concentrated on the first three or four hundred\r\nyards of the beachhead. Fortunately there was no bombing or strafing\r\nof the area, and although the development of exit roads was slow,\r\nthe congestion on the beach was cleared before trouble developed. [274]\r\n\r\nThe diversion of the 24th Division's LST's to the beaches of the 1st\r\nCavalry Division naturally strained the facilities of the beach and\r\nshore parties on White Beach. The southern end of White Beach also\r\nproved unsuitable for landing LST's, which consequently were shifted\r\nto the northern end. [275] However, the Army shore parties organized\r\nWhite Beach immediately upon landing. A two-way road was cleared along\r\nthe beach with military police directing traffic. Dump areas were\r\nmarked off by white ribbons, and sign posts were erected. The supplies\r\nwere unloaded from the landing craft by roller conveyors and \"fire\r\nbrigade methods\" directly onto the waiting trucks and trailers. [276]\r\nAfter the ships had been unloaded the shore parties consolidated all\r\nof the supplies into dumps as rapidly as possible. The rations and\r\nammunition, which were loaded on fifteen LVT's, were kept mobile to\r\nthe rear of the troops. [277]\r\n\r\nWhen Leyte was substituted for Yap as the target, it had been decided\r\nthat the 96th Division should unload troops and supplies at Leyte as\r\nrapidly as possible. Consequently, supplies were unloaded with little\r\nregard for the order in which items would be needed ashore. [278]\r\n\r\nThere was no general unloading on the beach in the XXIV Corps\r\narea until the late afternoon of A Day, when water, rations, and\r\nammunition were sent ashore. For about an hour the unloading proceeded\r\nsatisfactorily, but the beach soon became congested. The beach parties\r\nbrought in the supplies faster than they could be handled by the shore\r\nparties. [279] At one time more than eighty loaded boats waited over\r\nfive hours before they could be unloaded. The slowness of the shore\r\nparties in unloading the boats was not entirely their fault. Many of\r\nthe boats were improperly loaded with mixed cargo, a situation which\r\ncaused the boats to ship water. They were forced to come in to the\r\nbeach or sink. The shore parties were also handicapped by a lack of\r\nworkers. A shore party of 250 men included headquarters personnel,\r\nmilitary police, and communications men, leaving only fifty or sixty\r\nworkers. The unloading was further retarded by lack of sufficient\r\nmechanical equipment and failure to make full use of available\r\ntransportation. [280]\r\n\r\nLoose cargo piled up on the beaches faster than it could be taken to\r\nthe dump sites. [281] A deep swamp, 250 yards inland and parallel to\r\nBlue Beach, also limited the extension of dumps in that area. The\r\ncongestion was relieved the next day, when the supplies were taken\r\nto selected dump sites nearly as fast as they could be removed from\r\nthe boats.\r\n\r\nIn the Dulag area, the organization of the shore party and its\r\noperations were well co-ordinated. [282] In the initial phase the\r\n7th Division employed the \"drugstore system\" whereby DUKW's carried\r\nthe supplies directly to the front-line consumers of the division\r\nfrom specially loaded LST's which had been anchored off the landing\r\nbeaches. [283] By using this method the division was able to deliver\r\ncritical supplies to the combat troops within an hour after the\r\nrequest was received. At the same time, other supplies and equipment\r\ncould be put ashore without interruption.\r\n\r\nIn the wake of the initial assault waves, the engineer troops landed\r\nand began at once to clear the beaches, prepare dump sites, and build\r\naccess roads. The men worked around the clock in six-hour shifts. [284]\r\n\r\nWithin four hours the 7th Division's shore party was prepared to start\r\nfull-scale operations, and two hours later began to issue supplies\r\nto the assault forces. Since the cargo came ashore in nets, it was\r\npossible to use cranes and bulldozers to good advantage. The cargo\r\nwas initially moved over the landing beaches to regimental beach\r\ndumps 500 yards inland, and as vehicles landed they were driven to\r\ntemporary assembly areas or directly to their organizations. [285]\r\nSix hours after the first assault wave hit the beaches the 7th Division\r\nabandoned the floating drugstore system, since by that time sufficient\r\nsupplies had been brought ashore to fill requisitions directly from\r\nthe dumps. [286]\r\n\r\nDuring the day a total of 107,450 tons of supplies and equipment were\r\ndischarged over the beaches of the Sixth Army. Although the beaches\r\nin some instances were extremely congested, steps had been initiated\r\nto relieve the situation.\r\n\r\nNews of the success of the American forces in establishing a beachhead\r\non Leyte--the first foothold in the Philippine Islands--was joyfully\r\nreceived by the American nation. The President radioed congratulations\r\nto General MacArthur and added, \"You have the nation's gratitude\r\nand the nation's prayers for success as you and your men fight your\r\nway back....\"  [287]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Reaction\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Japanese undertook the defense of Leyte with serene\r\nassurance. Their pilots had erroneously reported the naval battle\r\noff Formosa as a great victory and declared that only remnants of\r\nthe once strong American Navy remained. The defeatist attitude of\r\nthe summer of 1944 vanished.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer there had been disagreement among the Japanese\r\nmilitary leaders. Imperial General Headquarters felt that the decisive\r\nbattle should be fought on Luzon and only delaying actions taken in\r\nother areas. To this the 14th Area Army agreed. The Southern Army,\r\non the other hand, believed that it would be impossible to wage a\r\nsuccessful battle on Luzon if other areas, especially the Visayan\r\nIslands, were allowed to fall into American hands. Since these islands,\r\nif captured, could be used as Allied air bases, the decisive battle\r\nshould be fought whenever and wherever the Americans attacked. [288]\r\n\r\nConfident that the U. S. fleet had suffered grievously in the battle\r\noff Formosa, the Japanese closed ranks and all the commands agreed\r\nthat the time was most opportune to deliver the coup de grâce. The\r\nfoolhardy Americans would take a severe drubbing, and Japan, after\r\na long series of humiliating and costly defeats, would regain the\r\ninitiative. It was therefore a jubilant Imperial General Headquarters\r\nthat ordered its armed forces to do battle with the Americans.\r\n\r\nThe essence of the Imperial General Headquarters plan was simple. The\r\nAmerican convoys and carriers were to be given complete freedom in\r\ntheir journey to the Philippine Islands. When they were sufficiently\r\nclose to make retreat difficult, the main strength of the Japanese\r\nArmy, Navy, and Air Forces would descend upon them and deliver a\r\nknockout blow. If the operation were launched too early, the Americans\r\ncould annihilate the inferior Japanese air strength before the battle\r\ncould be fought; if too late, the Americans could escape and the\r\nobjective would be lost. Imperial General Headquarters, therefore,\r\nwas \"patiently waiting\" for the opportune moment. [289]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Air Forces\r\n\r\nOn the evening of 17 October the 4th Air Army, upon receiving word that\r\nthe U. S. forces were in the vicinity of Suluan Island, ordered the\r\nentire 2d Air Division to attack the Americans. The main strength of\r\nthe fighter units was to be concentrated in the central and southern\r\nPhilippines areas. Although bad weather prevented a reconnaissance,\r\nthe increase in American air raids on the central and southern\r\nPhilippines made it imperative for the Japanese to attack with their\r\nmain air force. The 2d Air Division was ordered to move from Clark\r\nField on Luzon to Bacolod on Negros Island. It was unable to do this\r\nbecause of the bad weather, and it was therefore unable to forestall\r\nthe American landings. The commander of the 4th Air Army decided on\r\n21 October, as a result of the American landings, to use the entire\r\nair force under his command, employing the 7th Air Division and the\r\n30th Fighter Group, in addition to the 2d Air Division. The 12th Air\r\nBrigade of the 30th Fighter Group had just arrived in the Philippines\r\nfrom Japan, via Shanghai, and it was necessary to employ this brigade\r\nimmediately because of the impending battle in Leyte Gulf.\r\n\r\nAll the various units were to launch an attack against the American\r\nland forces and shipping by the evening of 23 October. On 24 October\r\nthere was to be a series of aerial attacks, the first early in the\r\nmorning with the entire force; the second consisting of two waves;\r\nthe third by the entire force in the evening; and during the night\r\nby waves of heavy and light bombers and assault planes. [290]\r\n\r\nThe Americans anticipated increased aerial activity over Leyte, and\r\ntherefore the number of fighters was increased on 24 October to 36,\r\non call from 0545 till dark, with an additional 16 fighters ready for\r\nimmediate action upon request. Twenty-eight of the 36 were assigned\r\nto the attack force commanders and 8, retained by General Krueger,\r\npatrolled the beachhead area and provided additional fighters when\r\nand where they were needed.\r\n\r\nThe Leyte area was subjected to a heavy air assault on the same day, 24\r\nOctober, when an estimated 150 to 200 enemy planes (mostly twin-engined\r\nbombers) approached northern Leyte. Sixty-six were definitely shot\r\ndown and eighteen others were probably shot down. [291] On the\r\nAmerican side, forty combat air patrol and ten direct supporting\r\nplanes participated in this engagement. Three American aircraft\r\ncrash-landed--two on the Tacloban airstrip and one in the water. [292]\r\nOnly a small percentage of the American air activity was directed\r\ntoward the neutralization of the enemy air force, as most of the\r\navailable aircraft were attacking the Japanese fleet. The Japanese\r\nwere determined to \"make Leyte the decisive air battlefield as well as\r\nthe decisive ground and naval battlefield of the Philippines.\" [293]\r\nFor the first time since the Allied counteroffensive in the Pacific had\r\nstarted rolling, the Japanese, for an extended period, risked aircraft\r\nin great numbers in daylight raids as well as at night. The shipping\r\noff Tacloban and Dulag and the Tacloban airfield were the principal\r\ntargets, though other air installations on the island were hit. An\r\nexample of the enemy's dogged determination occurred during the evening\r\nand night of 27 October. At twilight, twelve enemy fighters and dive\r\nbombers dropped 100-pound bombs in the vicinity of Tacloban and tried\r\nrepeatedly but unsuccessfully to strafe the Tacloban airstrip. After\r\na lull, the Japanese aircraft renewed the aerial assault just before\r\nmidnight and continued almost uninterruptedly until dawn. Between\r\n2332 and 0125, there were nine raids of two to four planes each;\r\nbetween 0340 and 0450, three raids of two to four planes each; and\r\nbetween 0454 and 0555 five additional planes made an attack on the\r\narea. [294] The Tacloban airstrip frequently was \"well illuminated\"\r\nby burning aircraft. [295]\r\n\r\nThe 2d Air Division assaulted American shipping from 24 through 28\r\nOctober, but because of the increasing necessity for giving air cover\r\nto the convoys the main strength of fighters of the 4th Air Army was\r\nused to protect the transportation of reinforcements of the 14th\r\nArea Army of Leyte. From 25 October on, the Bacolod airfield and\r\nthe air forces protecting the Japanese convoys going to Leyte were\r\nattacked by American bombers and suffered serious losses. Since it\r\nhad to participate in every phase of the action, the losses of the\r\n4th Air Army were heavy. [296]\r\n\r\nAfter 1 November the Japanese increasingly felt the American air power\r\nthrough attacks upon their air bases and shipping. Their fighter units,\r\nwhich had suffered considerable losses in protecting the convoys,\r\nwere ordered to counterattack. They were not successful. At the same\r\ntime the 4th Air Army received orders to protect the reinforcement\r\nconvoys in the Manila area. By this time the Japanese air forces'\r\nwings had been clipped and \"what had once been a formidable weapon\r\nwas transformed into a sacrificial army of guided missiles.\" [297]\r\nThe suicidal kamikaze pilot became the sole hope of the Japanese\r\nair forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Battle of Leyte Gulf\r\n\r\nJapanese Naval Plans\r\n\r\nOn 21 July the chief of the naval general staff, Imperial\r\nGeneral Headquarters, issued a directive for subsequent \"urgent\r\noperations.\" [298] The operational policy to be followed by the\r\nCombined Fleet was as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. Make utmost effort to maintain and make advantageous use of\r\n    the strategic status quo; plan to smash the enemy's strength;\r\n    take the initiative in creating favorable tactical opportunities,\r\n    or seize the opportunity as it presents itself to crush the enemy\r\n    fleet and attacking forces.\r\n\r\n    2. Co-operate in close conjunction with the Army, maintain the\r\n    security of sectors vital to national defense, and prepare for\r\n    future eventualities.\r\n\r\n    3. Co-operate closely with related forces to maintain security\r\n    of surface routes between Japan and vital southern sources of\r\n    materials. [299]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn 26 July the chief of the naval general staff informed Admiral\r\nToyoda, Commander in Chief, Combined Fleet, that the future \"urgent\r\noperations\" were to be known as the SHO (Victory) Operations. There\r\nwould be four SHO Operations. The first was to cover the defense of\r\nthe Philippine Archipelago. [300] It was essentially the last chance\r\nfor Japan to remain in the war. Said Admiral Toyoda of the situation\r\nat the time of the battle of Leyte Gulf:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Since without the participation of our\r\n    Combined Fleet there was no possibility of\r\n    the land-based forces in the Philippines having\r\n    any chance against your forces at all, it\r\n    was decided to send the whole fleet, taking\r\n    the gamble. If things went well, we might\r\n    obtain unexpectedly good results; but if the\r\n    worst should happen, there was a chance\r\n    that we would lose the entire fleet. But I felt\r\n    that that chance had to be taken....\r\n    Should we lose in the Philippines operations,\r\n    even though the fleet should be left, the shipping\r\n    lane to the south would be completely\r\n    cut off, so that the fleet, if it should come back\r\n    to Japanese waters, could not obtain its fuel\r\n    supply. If it should remain in southern waters,\r\n    it could not receive supplies of ammunition\r\n    and arms. There would be no sense in saving\r\n    the fleet at the expense of the Philippines. [301]\r\n\r\n\r\nSince their carrier force was weak, the Japanese had developed a\r\nplan based upon the main gunnery strength of the fleet and upon\r\nthe land-based air forces. Battleships and cruisers from a southern\r\nbase were to approach Leyte from the south, fight their way to the\r\nlanding beaches, and destroy Allied assault shipping. A decoy force\r\nwas to attempt to lure the U.S. carrier task force away from the\r\nmain action. Shore-based air forces were to inflict maximum damage\r\non the American carrier forces whenever and wherever possible,\r\nbut once the invasion came they were to conserve their strength\r\nuntil the day of the landings, when all the Allied assault shipping\r\nwould be concentrated off the beaches and when their attacks on the\r\nU.S. carriers would assist the advancing Japanese fleet. The plan\r\nwas designed to get the Japanese naval gunnery force into a position\r\nwhere it could do the greatest damage. Little attention was paid\r\nto getting it out. \"The war had reached a point where the Japanese\r\nfleet, hopelessly outnumbered and, as imminent events would prove,\r\neven more hopelessly out-classed, could not risk the fleet action it\r\nhad previously desired but was forced to expend itself in suicidal\r\nattack upon the United States transports.\" [302]\r\n\r\nUpon receiving information on 17 October that American vessels were\r\noff the shores of Suluan Island, Admiral Toyoda immediately alerted\r\nhis forces. On 18 October Toyoda, after intercepting American messages\r\ndealing with the landings on the island approaches to Leyte Gulf,\r\nactivated his plan for the defense of the Philippine Islands. The\r\ntarget date (X Day) for the fleet engagement was set for 22 October\r\nbut logistical difficulties caused a series of delays and on 21\r\nOctober Admiral Toyoda changed X Day to 25 October. \"From the far\r\ncorners of the shrinking Empire the whole combatant strength of the\r\nJapanese Navy converged on Leyte Gulf.\" [303]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Naval Battle [304]\r\n\r\nThe strongest Japanese naval force--the 1st Diversion Attack\r\nForce--moved from the south, reached Brunei Bay in northwest Borneo\r\non 20 October, and after refueling split into two parts and proceeded\r\non its way two days later. The main strength of the 1st Diversion\r\nAttack Force, under Admiral Kurita, sailed northeast up the west coast\r\nof Palawan (one of the Visayan Islands), and then turned eastward\r\nthrough the waters of the central Philippines to San Bernardino Strait,\r\nwhile the smaller unit commanded by Vice Adm. Shoji Nishimura moved\r\neastward through the Sulu Sea in order to force an entrance at Surigao\r\nStrait. The 2d Diversion Attack Force, commanded by Vice Adm. Kiyohide\r\nShima, after leaving the Pescadores on 21 October, sailed south,\r\npast western Luzon, and after refueling in the Calamian Islands,\r\njust south of Mindoro, proceeded to follow and support the southern\r\npart of the 1st Diversion Attack Force in forcing Surigao Strait.\r\n\r\nThe Main Body, consisting chiefly of partially empty carriers with\r\na destroyer escort, departed on the 20th, and on the evening of\r\nthe 22d turned southwest toward Luzon. It was commanded by Vice\r\nAdm. Jisabuto Ozawa. The Main Body was to act as a decoy to draw\r\noff the main American strength. The Japanese submarines off Formosa\r\nwere ordered south toward the eastern approaches to the Philippine\r\nArchipelago and the 2d Air Fleet, shortly before 23 October, began\r\nto arrive on Luzon. [305]\r\n\r\nThere were two American fleets in Philippine waters--the Seventh\r\nFleet under Admiral Kinkaid, whose superior was General MacArthur,\r\nand the Third Fleet under Admiral Halsey, whose superior was Admiral\r\nNimitz. The Seventh Fleet, which consisted of 6 old battleships, 16\r\nescort carriers, 4 heavy cruisers, 4 light cruisers, 30 destroyers,\r\nand 10 destroyer escorts, had escorted the convoy to Leyte and now\r\nstood by to protect it as it unloaded. The Third Fleet was composed\r\nof Task Force 38 under Admiral Mitscher. It consisted of four task\r\ngroups which averaged 23 ships each, divided about as follows:\r\n2 large carriers, 2 light carriers, 2 new battleships, 3 cruisers,\r\nand 14 destroyers. The task force was to secure air supremacy over\r\nthe Philippines, protect the landings, and apply unremitting pressure\r\non Japan. If the opportunity to destroy the major portion of the\r\nJapanese fleet should arise or could be created, that destruction\r\nwas to be its primary task.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese had 4 carriers, 7 battleships, 19 cruisers, 33 destroyers,\r\nand 2 battleship-carriers which carried no aircraft; there were 108\r\nplanes on the carriers and about 335 shore-based planes in the Luzon\r\narea. [306]\r\n\r\nOn 23 October two American submarines, the Dace and the Darter,\r\nencountered the 1st Diversion Attack Force and sank two heavy cruisers,\r\nthe Atago and Maya, off the western coast of Palawan. The former\r\nwas Kurita's flagship; its sinking forced the Japanese admiral to\r\ntransfer hurriedly to another vessel. The submarines also seriously\r\ndamaged another heavy cruiser.\r\n\r\nUpon receiving information that the Combined Fleet was steaming toward\r\nthe Philippines, Admiral Oldendorf's fire support group of the Seventh\r\nFleet moved to the southern end of Leyte Gulf and formed a battle\r\nline across the mouth of Surigao Strait while motor torpedo boats\r\npatrolled within the strait and about its southern entrance. Halsey's\r\nThird Fleet moved toward San Bernardino Strait. The escort carriers\r\nfrom Kinkaid's Seventh Fleet cruised off Leyte Gulf. [307]\r\n\r\nOn the 24th, after receiving a report from the submarine, the\r\ncarriers of the Third Fleet sent aircraft to search to the west and\r\nsouthwest. These aircraft sighted the main part of the 1st Diversion\r\nAttack Force south of Mindoro, and sighted and attacked the smaller\r\nforce under Admiral Nishimura off Negros, slightly damaging a\r\nbattleship and a destroyer. The aircraft of the carriers from their\r\nposition off San Bernardino Strait struck repeatedly at Kurita's\r\nforce while the smaller Nishimura force was left to the battleships in\r\nthe gulf. One Japanese battleship of the 1st Diversion Attack Force\r\nwas sunk, one heavy cruiser rendered impotent, and minor damage was\r\ninflicted on other battleships. The Japanese were forced temporarily\r\n\"to reverse course to westward.\" [308]\r\n\r\nThe aircraft from the Japanese 2d Air Fleet attempted to aid the\r\nnaval forces which were moving eastward through the Philippines. In\r\nco-operation with some aircraft from the Main Body, which was now\r\nabout 100 miles east of Luzon, they attacked the northernmost unit\r\nof the American carriers. Halsey's airmen sighted and reported the\r\nsacrificial Japanese Main Body in the afternoon. Not knowing that\r\nthis force consisted mainly of empty carriers and believing that\r\nthe 1st Diversion Attack Force had been severely damaged, Admiral\r\nHalsey withdrew the battleships and carriers of his Third Fleet and\r\nsteamed north to meet the new threat, leaving San Bernardino Strait\r\nwide open. At midnight Kurita's 1st Diversion Attack Force moved\r\nunmolested through San Bernardino Strait and turned south toward\r\nLeyte Gulf. The Japanese strategy had worked.\r\n\r\nIn the early morning hours, Admiral Oldendorf's warships destroyed the\r\nNishimura force as it sailed into Surigao Strait. Of two battleships,\r\none heavy cruiser, and four destroyers, only the cruiser and\r\none destroyer escaped from the strait, and the cruiser, which had\r\nbeen damaged, was sunk by aircraft from the U. S. carriers the next\r\nmorning. [309] Admiral Shima's 2d Diversion Attack Force, entering the\r\nsame strait thirty minutes after Nishimura's force, suffered damage to\r\na light cruiser that was hit by American torpedo boats. Shima's force\r\nthen made an abortive attack, during which its flagship was damaged\r\nby collision, and withdrew without having engaged. The Third Fleet\r\nfar to the north fell upon the decoy forces, sank all four carriers\r\nof the Main Body and thus \"wrote an end to the Japanese carrier air\r\nforce.\" [310]\r\n\r\nAdmiral Kurita's 1st Diversion Attack Force \"for which so much had been\r\nsacrificed\" [311] encountered Kinkaid's carriers and destroyers off\r\nthe coast of Samar. Admiral Kinkaid was ill prepared to meet the main\r\nthrust of the Japanese Navy, since his carriers were protected only by\r\ndestroyers and destroyer escorts. His \"handling of the exceedingly\r\ndifficult situation\" was \"superb.\" [312] The aircraft from his\r\ncarriers under Rear Adm. Clifton A. F. Sprague rose to the occasion\r\nand gave a \"magnificent performance,\" [313] continually attacking\r\nthe much stronger 1st Diversion Attack Force. Kurita's forces sank\r\none carrier, two destroyers, and one destroyer escort but lost three\r\nheavy cruisers and had one crippled. The American fighting strength\r\nwas greatly diminished at the very time it was needed to protect the\r\namphibious shipping that had carried the Sixth Army, and which still\r\nlay near the shores of Leyte Gulf. Just as it appeared inevitable that\r\nKurita would move in and deliver the coup de grâce, he suddenly broke\r\noff the engagement and retired toward San Bernardino Strait. After the\r\nwar he stated in justification of this strange move: \"The conclusion\r\nfrom our [the Japanese] gunfire and anti-aircraft fire during the\r\nday had led me to believe in my uselessness, my ineffectual position,\r\nif I proceeded into Leyte Gulf where I would come under even heavier\r\naircraft attack. I therefore concluded to go north and join Admiral\r\nOzawa for coordinated action against your northern Task Forces.\" [314]\r\n\r\nSaid Admiral Sprague: \"The failure of the enemy main body and\r\nencircling light forces to completely wipe out all vessels of\r\nthis Task Unit can be attributed to our successful smoke screen,\r\nour torpedo counterattack, continuous harassment of enemy by bomb,\r\ntorpedo, and strafing air attacks, timely maneuvers, and the definite\r\npartiality of Almighty God.\" [315]\r\n\r\nThe battle for Leyte Gulf was over. It had ended in a resounding\r\nvictory for the Americans, whose losses of 1 light carrier, 2 escort\r\ncarriers, 2 destroyers, and 1 destroyer escort were small in comparison\r\nwith the Japanese losses of 3 battleships, 1 large carrier, 3 light\r\ncarriers, 6 heavy cruisers, 4 light cruisers, and 9 destroyers. [316]\r\n\r\nAs the Japanese retreated throughout the 25th and 26th of October,\r\ncarrier- and land-based aircraft struck at the enemy vessels and\r\ninflicted fresh injuries upon them.\r\n\r\nThe Sixth Army summarized its view of the probable consequences if\r\nthe battle had gone against the U. S. Navy as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Had the [Japanese] plan succeeded the effect on the Allied troops\r\n    on Leyte in all likelihood would have been calamitous, for these\r\n    troops would have been isolated and their situation would have been\r\n    precarious indeed. If it had been victorious in the naval battle,\r\n    the Japanese fleet could have leisurely and effectively carried\r\n    out the destruction of shipping, aircraft, and supplies that were\r\n    so vital to Allied operations on Leyte. An enemy naval victory\r\n    would have had an adverse effect of incalculable proportions not\r\n    only upon the Leyte Operation, but upon the overall plan for the\r\n    liberation of the Philippines as well. [317]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sixth Army, however, was depicting the worst of all possible\r\ncontingencies. Admiral Halsey's conclusion is quite different:\r\n\r\n\r\n    That Kurita's force could have leisurely and effectively carried\r\n    out the destruction of shipping, aircraft, and supplies in Leyte\r\n    Gulf was not in the realm of possibilities.... Kurita would have\r\n    been limited to a hit-and-run attack in the restricted waters of\r\n    Leyte Gulf. He would further have been subjected to the attack of\r\n    the cruisers present in Leyte Gulf. He would have been limited\r\n    to minor damage.... The statement that an enemy naval victory\r\n    would have an effect of incalculable proportions not only on the\r\n    Leyte operation, but upon the overall plan for the liberation\r\n    of the Philippines as well, can only be premised on the thought\r\n    that our naval forces would be almost totally destroyed. The\r\n    prognostication of such a condition could be reasoned on none of\r\n    the facts existing during this three days' engagement. [318]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Reinforce the Leyte Garrison\r\n\r\nThe Japanese felt that the honors of the battle were evenly divided\r\nand consequently continued with their program of making Leyte the\r\ndecisive battle of the Philippines. Although the American fleet had\r\nsoundly whipped the Japanese Navy, the Japanese were still able to\r\nsend reinforcements in great numbers to their Leyte garrison. Because\r\nof the lack of sufficient aerial strength, the Americans were unable\r\nto check the steady flow of troops into the port of Ormoc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmerican Aerial Retaliation\r\n\r\nThe carrier strikes of the Seventh and Third Fleets up to and through\r\nA Day had been most successful in forestalling any concentrated\r\neffort on the part of the Japanese against the American shipping\r\nin Leyte Gulf and the troops on the coastal strand. Thereafter, the\r\nJapanese unleashed a furious air assault on the American forces and\r\nshipping. [319]\r\n\r\nAt the same time, American aircraft from the carriers struck at the\r\nJapanese troops and their installations in close support of the ground\r\ntroops. The first called-for air strike was at 0834 on 21 October\r\nagainst bridges over streams that were not fordable along the road\r\nleading from Ormoc to Carigara, in order to prevent enemy movement\r\nalong this road. [320] A total of 121 missions were flown in support\r\nof ground units during the first four days, of which only 33 had been\r\nrequested by the air liaison parties. The targets for these missions\r\nincluded artillery and mortar positions, fuel and supply dumps,\r\nbridges, pillboxes, and other installations, together with trucks,\r\narmored vehicles, and tanks. [321]\r\n\r\nDuring the initial stages of the campaign, Navy flyers gave efficient\r\nclose support to the ground forces. [322] The average time required\r\nto carry out each of these support missions was approximately one\r\nhour, though the usual difficulties of locating friendly troops\r\nand pinpointing the target were present. Enthusiastic reports on\r\nthe effectiveness of this co-operation from naval air were made by\r\nthe 7th Division. Members of this division, which formerly had been\r\nsupported by Army and Navy air forces, found Navy air support in the\r\nfirst days on Leyte far more satisfactory than that which the Army\r\nAir Forces had been able to provide in the past. They believed that\r\nthis superiority was due to the system that the Navy had worked out\r\nfor directing strikes at close-in targets without endangering friendly\r\nground forces, and to the Navy's use of rehearsals with ground units\r\nto establish mutual understanding and confidence. [323]\r\n\r\nThe Battle of Leyte Gulf interfered greatly with the close support\r\nrendered by the Navy, since the carrier-based planes had to be\r\nwithdrawn. The combat air patrol assignments were also disrupted\r\nbecause of surface engagements and the repairing of the CVE's. [324]\r\n\r\nAt this time the Japanese had about 432,000 men in the Philippines,\r\nincluding air force and construction units. Most of them believed\r\nthat they were well prepared to meet the Americans. In fact a staff\r\nofficer of the 14th Area Army, upon hearing that the Americans had\r\nlanded on Leyte, is reported to have jumped up and exclaimed: \"Good,\r\nthey have picked the place where our finest troops are located.\" [325]\r\nIt was also thought that the American troops on Leyte were \"having\r\na difficult time.\" [326] Nevertheless, General Yamashita, who had\r\nsucceeded Kuroda as the commanding general of the 14th Area Army,\r\nsent the 1st Division and other units to Leyte. The Japanese felt that\r\n\"if the decisive battle in Leyte results in failure, it will upset\r\nthe entire operation in the Philippines and the decisive battle in\r\nLuzon will be lost.\" [327]\r\n\r\nBy the 25th of October a battalion of the 55th Independent Mixed\r\nBrigade and one of the 57th Independent Mixed Brigade from Cebu,\r\ntogether with two battalions of the 30th Division, had arrived on Leyte\r\nto reinforce the 16th Division. Shortly after the Sixth Army landed,\r\nthe 35th Army commander, General Suzuki, received orders from General\r\nYamashita to undertake an all-out offensive against the Americans. All\r\nJapanese air, naval, and land forces were to participate. [328]\r\n\r\nOn 22 October the 14th Area Army asked the 35th Army how the 26th\r\nDivision and 68th Independent Mixed Brigade were to be utilized if\r\nthe Japanese decisively won the pending naval battle. The 35th Army\r\nstated that if the Japanese Navy were victorious, the units were\r\nto prevent the landing of more Americans at Leyte Gulf, but if it\r\nwere unsuccessful the troops were to be landed at Carigara Bay. The\r\noptimism of the Japanese was high. Said Maj. Gen. Yoshiharu Tomochika,\r\nChief of Staff, 35th Army: \"We were determined to take offensive after\r\noffensive and clean up American forces on Leyte Island.... We seriously\r\ndiscussed demanding the surrender of the entire American Army after\r\nseizing General MacArthur.\" [329] Then came the Battle of Leyte Gulf.\r\n\r\nDespite the setbacks caused by this disastrous sea battle, the Japanese\r\ncontinued to send troops to Leyte through Ormoc. The reinforcement of\r\nLeyte consisted of moving five major units, in nine echelons: the 35th\r\nArmy moved as many of its units as possible from Mindanao, Cebu, and\r\nPanay; the 1st Division was sent down from Luzon on 1 November; then\r\nthe 26th Division, the 68th Independent Mixed Brigade, and one third\r\nof the 8th Division were sent from Luzon in the order given. [330]\r\n\r\nOn 27 October the Fifth Air Force took over the mission of supporting\r\nthe Sixth Army. As the airstrips were not in serviceable condition,\r\nonly a small detachment--the 308th Bombardment Wing--could be sent\r\nin. Aircraft from the carriers continued to give support. The Fifth Air\r\nForce felt that it could best check the Japanese reinforcement program,\r\nand at the same time give more lasting support to the ground troops,\r\nby attacking the Japanese convoys before they arrived in Leyte. The\r\nFifth Air Force intended also to attack large movements of land\r\ntroops, concentrations, and supply areas. Army Air Forces doctrine\r\nassigned close support as the third priority mission of tactical air\r\nforces. [331] Since there were always insufficient aircraft for the\r\nmissions assigned to the air forces, close support of ground troops\r\nsuffered.\r\n\r\nThe Allied Air Forces, which had been given the mission of supporting\r\nthe Leyte operation, directed its main efforts against airfields in\r\nbypassed areas. Two fighter groups were on Morotai, one heavy bomber\r\ngroup was on Noemfoor, off the north coast of New Guinea, and two\r\nheavy bomber groups were on Biak; they completed 175 sorties in strikes\r\nagainst airfields on Mindanao and the Visayan area. The main targets\r\nof attack were on Mindanao and Cebu and in the Negros area. [332]\r\nThe XIII Bomber Command, which carried the burden of this assault,\r\nwas to neutralize targets previously hit and protect the southwestern\r\nflank of the American forces in the Philippines. The 42d Bombardment\r\nGroup (medium bombers) in October flew the greatest number of sorties\r\nin the history of the group up to that time. [333]\r\n\r\nThe heavy bombers (B-24's) of the 868th Bombardment Squadron, operating\r\nfrom Noemfoor, had as their main target enemy shipping in the Makassar\r\nStrait. At the same time, the B-24's that were within range of the Sulu\r\nSea struck at the Japanese Southern Fleet as it retreated after its\r\nengagement with the Seventh Fleet. The fighters and medium bombers,\r\nwhich had been used to strike at targets on Mindanao, were alerted\r\nto strike any enemy naval vessels that came within range. [334]\r\n\r\nWhile protecting the southwestern flank of the American forces in\r\nthe Philippines, the XIII Bomber Command was extraordinarily busy\r\non 26 October. Part of the Japanese naval task force, consisting of\r\nthree battleships, five cruisers, and four destroyers, had withdrawn\r\nfrom the Leyte area and was in the Sulu Sea when sighted by the 307th\r\nBombardment Group. Twenty-eight B-24's of the bombardment group made\r\ntheir principal targets two of the battleships--one of the Kongo\r\nclass and the other of the Yamato class. Three of the planes were\r\nshot down as the Japanese skillfully and evasively maneuvered their\r\nvessels so that none was sunk. At the same time B-24's from the 5th\r\nBombardment Squadron sighted and sank an enemy light cruiser at a\r\ndifferent location in the Sulu Sea. [335]\r\n\r\nGeneral MacArthur had originally allocated the attack of all\r\nland targets in the Philippines to the Allied Air Forces, [336]\r\nand although subsequent events occasioned a modification of this\r\norder the Fifth Air Force officially established its advance units\r\non Leyte at 1600 on 27 October and assumed operational control of\r\nland-based aircraft. [337] The 308th Bombardment Wing, the advance\r\nechelon of the Fifth Air Force, had two major duties included in\r\nits mission. It was to obtain air superiority over the Philippines\r\nand to isolate the Japanese forces on the battlefield of Leyte. In\r\naddition to these two principal tasks it was to render maximum close\r\nsupport to the ground forces, establish night fighter patrols and a\r\nsystem of courier aircraft, and provide maximum protection to Allied\r\nnaval vessels. [338] Among the Army flyers of the 49th Fighter Group,\r\nan advance party of the Fifth Air Force that arrived on 27 October,\r\nwas Maj. Richard I. Bong, of the 9th Fighter Squadron, the leading ace\r\nof the Army Air Forces. He celebrated his arrival by shooting down an\r\nenemy plane. [339] On 28 October the Army flyers of the 7th Fighter\r\nSquadron got their first enemy airplane on Leyte. Since there were\r\n\"only\" three enemy air raids during the night, the men were able to\r\nget some much needed sleep. [340]\r\n\r\nThe 29th of October, however, was a day of heavy action for the Army\r\nflyers, as described in a report of the 7th Fighter Squadron:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The 29th was a day that will be long remembered.... Two more\r\n    Nips were added to the unit's score;... the 49th Group's 500th\r\n    victory. But more important at that time was the fact ... [that]\r\n    the ... road between the strip and the camp collapsed under\r\n    army traffic.... The already long hours were lengthened still\r\n    more as pilots and men were forced to arise between three and\r\n    four o'clock in the morning, make their way to the barge at\r\n    Tacloban, cross to the strip by water and then sweat out the\r\n    pre-dawn raids. At night, the planes landing at dusk had hardly\r\n    hit the runway before ... BOFORS [40-mm. antiaircraft guns] went\r\n    off and the lights went out. Then down to the end of the strip\r\n    near the gas dumps, and another session of sweating beneath A/A\r\n    [antiaircraft] awaiting the barge for the trip back to Tacloban\r\n    and then to camp. Supper was served as late as 10 o'clock ... a\r\n    few brave individuals tried an alternate road to the south,\r\n    swinging out east to White Beach above Dulag and then north along\r\n    the beach to Tacloban Strip. Japanese snipers soon put a stop to\r\n    this travel during the hours of darkness.\r\n\r\n    To add to the \"big day\"--29 October--the weather observers\r\n    reported a 50 knot gale on the way. Working after dark, pilots\r\n    and linemen minus the regular tie downs and using tent ropes\r\n    and anything available secured the airplanes to jeeps, trucks,\r\n    trailers and tractors. At night, in camp, the small typhoon hit\r\n    and with it went three or four tents, occupants of which awoke to\r\n    find themselves thoroughly drenched and at odds with the world,\r\n    Leyte in particular. [341]\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough 29 October was the most difficult day on Leyte for the\r\nmen of the 7th Fighter Squadron, they were again disheartened the\r\nfollowing day, when one of the squadron's pilots was shot down by\r\nfriendly antiaircraft. [342]\r\n\r\nDuring the first week of November, offensive operations by the Fifth\r\nAir Force were primarily against targets in Ormoc Valley and enemy\r\nshipping in Ormoc Bay. The barrios of Ormoc, Valencia, and Palompon\r\nwere the first land targets. Most of the strikes, however, were\r\nagainst Japanese shipping in Ormoc Bay and in the vicinity of the\r\nCamotes Islands. [343]\r\n\r\nBy 4 November a number of P-38's had been destroyed by bombs and\r\nstrafing, some of which were completely burned up. To cut down the\r\naircraft losses, it was decided to have planes of some of the squadrons\r\nuse the Bayug airstrip in the Dulag area. But since this was a poor\r\nairfield which soon became overcrowded and subject to Japanese air\r\nattacks, it was finally abandoned. [344]\r\n\r\nOn 3 November fifteen P-38's of the 49th Bomber Group struck \"one of\r\nthe most lucrative strafing targets of their history.\" [345] In an\r\nearly morning search for enemy shipping in Ormoc Bay the bombers found\r\nnothing, but on their return they sighted a ten-mile-long convoy of\r\ntrucks, artillery, and tanks extending from Ormoc to Valencia. The\r\nconvoy was strafed and dispersed, leaving twenty to thirty-five\r\ntrucks destroyed and many other vehicles, including two tanks, in\r\nflames. [346] However, two American planes were shot down by enemy\r\nantiaircraft fire, four came in on single engines, and all showed\r\nmany bullet holes. The bombers made no further strikes against the\r\nconvoy, \"as all aircraft received extremely heavy and accurate ground\r\nfire.\" [347]\r\n\r\nThe airmen of the Fifth Air Force continued to hit shipping in Ormoc\r\nBay and in the Camotes Islands, and they also achieved success against\r\nbridges, airfields, troops, camp areas, and transportation. [348]\r\nAlthough the number of Japanese air raids had diminished by 6\r\nNovember, the Americans could not yet feel that they were \"out of\r\nthe rough.\" [349] There was insufficient direct air support for the\r\nground troops throughout the operation and the Japanese continued to\r\nsend troops into Ormoc. The constant stream of Japanese reinforcements\r\ncoming into Leyte augured ill for the success of the operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe TA Operation\r\n\r\nThe TA Operation, by which name the Japanese program for the\r\nreinforcement of Leyte was known, continued from 23 October through\r\n11 December. The numerical weakness of the U. S. land-based aircraft\r\nenabled the Japanese to land many thousands of troops and tons of\r\nsupplies on Leyte. Nine convoys in all were sent to the port of\r\nOrmoc, on the west coast. [350] As a whole, however, the operation\r\nwas \"literally gruesome\" to the Japanese, since their transports and\r\nescort vessels were struck again and again by American aircraft.\r\n\r\nThe first Japanese convoy had three echelons. The first consisted of\r\na landing barge and an auxiliary sailing vessel carrying about 300\r\ntroops of the 102d Division. The second echelon, whose composition\r\nwas identical with the first, carried about 150 troops of the same\r\ndivision. Both safely discharged their troops on 23 and 25 October,\r\nrespectively. The third echelon was made up of 2 destroyers, together\r\nwith 4 transports carrying about 2,000 men of the 30th Division. The\r\ntransports safely unloaded their passengers on 26 October, but American\r\nairmen later sank the destroyers and all but one of the transports. The\r\nremaining vessel was damaged.\r\n\r\nThe second convoy consisted of three echelons, composed of 3, 1,\r\nand 4 transports respectively. The escorting vessels of the third\r\nechelon, the only one that had an escort, consisted of 6 destroyers\r\nand 4 coast defense vessels. The escort vessels carried the troops of\r\nthe 1st Division: the first wave about 1,000 men, the second about\r\n100 headquarters men, and the third approximately 10,000 troops and\r\nabout 9,000 ship tons of provisions and ammunition. All vessels safely\r\ndebarked their troops on 1 and 2 November.\r\n\r\nThe 5 transports of the third convoy carried about 2,000 troops of the\r\n26th Division and approximately 6,600 tons of supplies. The convoy\r\nsailed from Manila on 9 November and was escorted by 1 submarine\r\nchaser, 1 torpedo boat squadron, and 4 destroyers. On 10 November,\r\nwhen the convoy reached the mouth of Ormoc Bay, American airmen\r\ndestroyed all of the escort vessels and transports before they could\r\nunload their troops and cargo.\r\n\r\nEach of the two echelons of the fourth convoy had 3 transports, but\r\nonly the first one had an escort--6 destroyers and 4 coast defense\r\nvessels. The first echelon carried approximately 10,000 troops of the\r\n26th Division and about 3,500 tons of supplies, including provisions,\r\nammunition, and four long-range guns. The second echelon carried\r\nabout 1,000 men of the 1st Division. Both discharged their troops\r\nsafely on 9 November, a day earlier than the anticipated arrival of\r\nthe third convoy, but because of American air action, they were able\r\nto get only a limited part of the supplies ashore.\r\n\r\nThe fifth convoy was organized on the same pattern as its predecessor,\r\nbut the first wave had a submarine chaser as an escort while the\r\nsecond had a destroyer. This convoy, which left Manila between 11 and\r\n25 November with an unknown number of troops and quantity of supplies,\r\nwas completely destroyed en route to Leyte.\r\n\r\nThe sixth convoy, composed of 2 transports, 2 submarine chasers,\r\nand 1 patrol boat, carried approximately 2,500 tons of provisions and\r\nammunition. It entered Ormoc harbor on 28 November and had completed\r\nmost of its unloading when the vessels were either sunk or set afire\r\nby U.S. aircraft and motor torpedo boats.\r\n\r\nThere were four echelons in the seventh convoy. The composition of\r\nthe first two is unknown, but it is known that the first echelon\r\ncompleted unloading at Ipil just south of Ormoc on 30 November. The\r\nthird and fourth echelons, consisting altogether of 3 transports and 2\r\ndestroyers, also carried an unknown number of troops and quantity of\r\nsupplies. As they were unloading at Ormoc on 2 December, the vessels\r\nwere attacked by American airmen who sank one of the destroyers and\r\ndamaged the other. The transports and the damaged destroyer returned\r\nto Manila.\r\n\r\nThe 4 transports of the eighth convoy, escorted by 3 destroyers and 2\r\nsubmarine chasers, carried about 4,000 troops--the main body of the\r\n68th Independent Brigade--and an unknown quantity of provisions and\r\nammunition. It unloaded some of its troops and a part of the cargo at\r\nSan Isidro on the west coast of Leyte on 7 December; but immediately\r\nthereafter, American aircraft sank the transports and heavily damaged\r\nthe destroyers.\r\n\r\nThere were two echelons in the ninth convoy. The first echelon, which\r\nconsisted of 5 transports, 3 destroyers, and 2 submarine chasers,\r\ncarried approximately 3,000 troops of the 5th Infantry Regiment,\r\n8th Division, and about 900 tons of provisions and ammunition. In\r\nunloading at Ormoc on 11 December, 1 destroyer was sunk and 1 destroyer\r\nand 1 transport were damaged. The remaining vessels then moved to\r\nPort Palompon on the west coast of Leyte and completed unloading. The\r\nsecond echelon consisted of only one transport and carried an unknown\r\nnumber of troops and quantity of supplies. It was able on 11 December\r\nto elude the American airmen and complete its unloading. [351]\r\n\r\nAfter the war, General Nishimura, who had been on the staff of the\r\n14th Area Army, made the amazing statement that nearly 80 percent\r\nof the vessels sent to Ormoc were sunk en route. Although most of\r\nthe vessels went down close enough to the Leyte shore for the troops\r\nto swim ashore, the equipment lost could not be replaced. [352] It\r\nis estimated that the Japanese landed more than 45,000 troops and\r\nsomething over 10,000 tons of matériel. [353]\r\n\r\nEven though the Japanese had not succeeded completely in their\r\nreinforcement program, General Krueger was faced with a far stronger\r\nfoe than had been anticipated. The Leyte Campaign was to be long\r\nand costly and was to upset the timetable for the impending Luzon\r\noperation. At the end of A Day the American assault forces had firmly\r\nestablished themselves on the shores of Leyte, but the battle for\r\nthe island was yet to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nSouthern Leyte Valley: Part One\r\n\r\n\r\nThe SHO Operations\r\n\r\nIn their preliminary planning, the Japanese considered that the defense\r\nof Leyte would be only a delaying action. The defenders were to inflict\r\nas many casualties as possible upon the invaders and also to prevent\r\nthem from using the Leyte airfields, but the decisive battle for the\r\nPhilippines would be fought on Luzon. As late as 10 October the chief\r\nof staff of the 35th Army received the following order from Manila:\r\n\"Depending on conditions the 35th Army will prepare to dispatch as\r\nlarge a force to LUZON ISLAND as possible.\" [354]\r\n\r\nOn 21 October, after receiving news of the American landings, General\r\nYamashita activated SHO ICHI GO (Victory Operation Number One). He\r\nmade it clear that the Japanese Army, in co-operation with \"the\r\ntotal force of the Air Force and Navy,\" was to make a major effort\r\non Leyte and destroy the American forces on the island. The 35th Army\r\nwas to concentrate its forces there. The 1st and 26th Divisions, the\r\n68th Brigade, and an artillery unit from the 14th Area Army would be\r\nsent to augment the 35th Army troops. At the same time General Suzuki\r\nreceived information that the Japanese Air Force and Navy would engage\r\nin \"decisive\" battles in support. \"The morale of the 35th Army rose\r\nas a result.\"\r\n\r\nThe Japanese thought that only two American divisions had landed on\r\nLeyte, and that if the 1st, 16th, 30th, and 102d Divisions engaged\r\nthe Americans, a decisive victory would be theirs. General Suzuki\r\ndecided to send forward the following reinforcements to Leyte: the\r\nmain force of the 30th Division, only three battalions of which would\r\nremain in Mindanao; three infantry battalions of the 102d Division;\r\nand one independent infantry battalion each from the 55th and 57th\r\nIndependent Mixed Brigades. These forces were in addition to the two\r\nbattalions previously sent on 23 October.\r\n\r\nGeneral Suzuki believed that the Americans would attempt to join and\r\nstrengthen their beachheads in the vicinity of Tacloban and Dulag\r\nbefore they tried to penetrate inland. At the same time, since Catmon\r\nHill and the high ground west of Tacloban Valley were in Japanese\r\nhands, the 16th Division should be able to contain the Americans\r\nuntil reinforcements arrived.\r\n\r\nHe therefore issued orders based upon these assumptions and also\r\nupon the assumption that the Japanese air and naval forces would be\r\nvictorious. The 35th Army was to concentrate its reinforcements in\r\nthe Carigara area. The principal elements of the 16th Division were to\r\noccupy Burauen and Dagami, and the rest of the division would occupy\r\nCatmon Hill and the western plateau of Tacloban. The 16th Division was\r\nto protect the concentration of the main force of the 35th Army. The\r\n102d Division was to occupy the Jaro area and give direct protection\r\nto the 1st and 26th Divisions and the 68th Brigade. The 30th Division\r\nwas to land at Ormoc Bay in the Albuera area and then advance to the\r\nBurauen area in coordination with the 16th Division and assist the\r\nmain force of the 35th Army. The 1st Division was to land at Ormoc,\r\nthe 26th Division and 68th Brigade were to land at Carigara. If the\r\nsituation were favorable, however, the 68th Brigade was to land in\r\nthe vicinity of Catmon Hill. After the main elements of the 35th\r\nArmy had assembled at Carigara and the area southeast of it, they\r\nwere to move down Leyte Valley and annihilate the American forces in\r\nthe Tacloban area. All the important airfields, bases, and roads were\r\nalso in the valley.\r\n\r\nThe part of Leyte Valley where the Americans hoped air and supply\r\nbases could be developed is a broad and level plain inside a\r\nquadrangle formed by the main roads linking Tanauan, Dulag, Burauen\r\nand Dagami. (Map 7) The region extending ten miles westward from\r\nthe stretch of coast between Dulag and Tanauan to the foothills of\r\nthe central range is an alluvial plain, interlaced by many streams,\r\nin which swamps and rice paddies predominate. Catmon Hill, about half\r\nway between Tanauan and Dulag, was the most prominent terrain feature\r\nnear the shore line.\r\n\r\nCatmon Hill is actually a series of hills with many spurs. This hill\r\nmass starts at the mouth of the Labiranan River above San Jose where\r\nLabiranan Head meets Highway 1, the coastal road, and extends in a\r\ngeneral northwest direction to the vicinity of San Vicente and Pikas\r\nwhere it drops abruptly into the coastal plain. It is covered with\r\ncogon grass about six feet high, in the midst of which are found a\r\nfew trees. The beach areas between the Calbasag River on the south\r\nand Tolosa on the north, together with much of southern Leyte Valley,\r\nare dominated by this hill mass. [355]\r\n\r\nThe 16th Division made use of the caves on Catmon Hill for shelters,\r\nartillery positions, and supply dumps, and established well-concealed\r\ncoconut log pillboxes and observation posts at numerous vantage points\r\non the hills. Some of these pillboxes, with good fields of fire and\r\nspider holes, were emplaced in positions to cover the roads. [356] A\r\nspider hole was dug about five feet deep, sometimes camouflaged with a\r\nremovable cover, and was large enough to contain a man and his weapon.\r\n\r\nThe American prelanding naval bombardment destroyed a number of field\r\npieces of the 22d Field Artillery Regiment, which was deployed in\r\nposition along the first line of defense. The gunfire also disrupted\r\nthe regiment's radio service, and direct communication with the 35th\r\nArmy and the 14th Area Army headquarters was temporarily broken. [357]\r\n\r\nAfter the heavy naval bombardment on A Day and the subsequent landings\r\nby American forces in the Dulag area, General Makino moved the command\r\npost of the 16th Division to Dagami, a step which made communications\r\nvery difficult and inadequate. The troops of the division were then\r\ndisposed as follows: the 20th Infantry Regiment, though considerably\r\ndiminished in number, was holding Julita, and one of its platoons\r\npatrolled the Daguitan River banks; the main part of the 9th Infantry\r\nRegiment was at Catmon Hill, while one of its battalions occupied\r\nTabontabon. [358]\r\n\r\nAt the end of 20 October the Sixth Army was established on the shores\r\nof Leyte Gulf. The X Corps was in the north near Palo and Tacloban,\r\nand the XXIV Corps was in the vicinity of Dulag, poised for a drive\r\ninto southern Leyte Valley. General Krueger planned to push rapidly\r\nthrough Leyte Valley and secure its important roads, airfields, and\r\nbase sites before General Makino could regroup the 16th Division and\r\noffer a firm line of resistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnlarging the 96th Division Beachhead\r\n\r\nGeneral Krueger had assigned the mission of seizing southern Leyte\r\nValley to the XXIV Corps. The 96th Division was to seize Catmon Hill\r\nand its surrounding area, together with the Dagami-Tanauan road. The\r\n7th Division was to proceed along the Dulag-Burauen road, seize the\r\nairfields in that area, and then proceed north to Dagami.\r\n\r\nGeneral Bradley's scheme of maneuver for the 96th Division specified a\r\nmovement into the interior from the beachhead area in a northwesterly\r\ndirection with regiments abreast--the 383d Infantry on the right\r\n(north) and the 382d Infantry on the left (south). The 1st Battalion,\r\n383d Infantry, was to capture Labiranan Head and secure Highway 1\r\nas far north as San Roque. The rest of the regiment was to proceed\r\ninland, bypass Catmon Hill at first, and then, after artillery,\r\nnaval bombardment, and air strikes had neutralized it, to capture\r\nCatmon Hill and the adjacent high ground.\r\n\r\nThe 382d Infantry was to proceed inland in a northwesterly direction\r\nand seize Anibung, which was erroneously believed to have an\r\nairfield. The regiment was then to be ready to advance either to the\r\nnorth or to the west. [359]\r\n\r\nAt the end of A Day the assault troops of the 383d Infantry, commanded\r\nby Colonel May, were approximately 2,500 yards inland. The forward\r\npositions of the 1st Battalion were 400 yards up the sides of the\r\nridge running north from where the troops had crossed the Labiranan\r\nRiver. The 3d Platoon of Company C had established a roadblock at the\r\nhighway crossing; the 2d Battalion, protecting the regimental southern\r\nboundary, had advanced 2,600 yards inland from Orange Beach 1; and\r\nthe 3d Battalion had established a night perimeter 800 yards southwest\r\nof the 1st Battalion on the southern bank of the Labiranan River. [360]\r\n\r\nThe 382d Infantry, under Colonel Dill, had made a successful landing\r\non A Day. The 2d Battalion, on the right, had pushed inland 2,700\r\nyards, while the 3d Battalion, on the left, had gained 1,300 yards;\r\nthe 1st Battalion was in reserve. Contact had been established with\r\nthe 32d Infantry, 7th Division, on the 382d Infantry's left, and with\r\nthe 383d Infantry on its right. [361]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLabiranan Head\r\n\r\nDuring the night of 20-21 October the 361st Field Artillery Battalion\r\nfired upon Labiranan Head in support of the 1st Battalion, 383d\r\nInfantry. [362] In addition naval guns, supporting the 96th Division,\r\nfired harassing and interdicting missions against possible enemy\r\npositions and lines of communication. [363] At 0810 on 21 October an\r\nair strike was registered on Labiranan Head, followed by a three-hour\r\nnaval and artillery barrage.\r\n\r\nThe 382d Infantry was to move inland, maintain contact with the\r\n7th Division, and forestall any Japanese attempt to reach the\r\nbeaches. Concurrently, the 1st Battalion, 383d Infantry, would advance\r\non Catmon Hill from Labiranan Head while the 2d and 3d Battalions of\r\nthe regiment would swing around the northwest end of Catmon Hill and\r\nsqueeze the Japanese in a pincers.\r\n\r\nAt 1130 an assault force commanded by Capt. Hugh D. Young of the 1st\r\nBattalion, 383d Infantry, attacked the Japanese position on Labiranan\r\nHead. This assault force, a composite company, consisted of a platoon\r\neach from A, B, and C Companies, together with the weapons platoon\r\nfrom C Company. The troops moved up the ridge and within ten minutes\r\nafter starting destroyed one machine gun and drove off the crew of\r\nanother. Under cover of mortar fire, the Japanese retired to the\r\nnext ridge.\r\n\r\nIn co-operation with the advance of Captain Young's force, the 3d\r\nPlatoon of Company C, which had established the roadblock at the\r\nHighway 1 crossing of Labiranan River on A Day, moved out just below\r\nLabiranan Head and hit the Japanese flank. The platoon met a strongly\r\nentrenched enemy position which consisted of seven pillboxes guarding\r\nten 75-mm. guns. There were also six coastal guns but only two of\r\nthese had been even partially assembled. When the men of the platoon\r\ngot within twenty feet of the enemy position, they received fire from\r\nthe two flanks and the front. After knocking out a machine gun nest\r\nthe platoon withdrew.\r\n\r\nLt. Col. Edwin O. List, the commanding officer of the 1st Battalion,\r\nthen ordered Captain Young to advance northward up a covered draw and\r\nsecure a small hill in the rear of the enemy force. As the troops\r\nadvanced up the hill, they observed smoke coming from Labiranan\r\nHead. Company D thereupon placed mortar fire on the position which\r\ncontained the ten 75-mm. guns. At 1430 Captain Young requested that\r\nthe fire be lifted; this was done, and the advance continued. [364]\r\n\r\nAt 1600 Captain Young reported that his troops had secured Labiranan\r\nHead. At the same time, friendly naval gunfire shelled Young's\r\ntroops. [365] This gunfire was not stopped, since there were\r\nknown Japanese positions in the vicinity and it was believed to\r\nbe of more lasting importance to knock them out than to hold this\r\none position. Captain Young evacuated Labiranan Head and withdrew\r\nhis troops, who swam across the Labiranan River and formed a night\r\nperimeter on the south bank. At the end of the day the front lines of\r\nthe rest of the 1st Battalion, 383d Infantry, were along the northern\r\nbanks of the Labiranan River and on the high ground 800 yards west\r\nof Labiranan Head. [366]\r\n\r\nDuring the night the 361st, 363d, and 921st Field Artillery Battalions\r\ndelivered harassing fires on the positions of the 9th Infantry Regiment\r\non Labiranan Head. [367] The following morning, Captain Young's force\r\nrejoined the 1st Battalion, 383d Infantry. The 921st Field Artillery\r\nBattalion continued to pound the enemy emplacements until 1200\r\nand then supported the attack as the 1st Battalion, 383d Infantry,\r\nwith Companies A and C as lead companies, moved up the slopes of\r\nLabiranan Head. The antitank platoon of the 1st Battalion set up its\r\n37-mm. guns in a position from which it could rake the south side of\r\nLabiranan Head from the river and support the advance of Company C on\r\nthe left. The platoon knocked out four pillboxes and two machine guns\r\nand then directed fire on the enemy 75-mm. guns. Companies A and C\r\npushed aside the Japanese and at 1630 reached the crest of the hill,\r\ntheir objective. They immediately dug in, consolidated the position,\r\nand then formed a night perimeter from which the entire beach area\r\nfrom San Roque to Dulag could be observed. [368]\r\n\r\nAt 1930 the Japanese centered a counterattack on Company A on the right\r\nflank of the 1st Battalion, 383d Infantry. A combined concentration\r\nfrom the 921st, 361st, and 363d Field Artillery Battalions repelled\r\nthis assault. [369] While Labiranan Hill was being secured, a force\r\nconsisting of the 3d Platoon, Company C, the 1st Platoon, Company\r\nD, 763d Tank Battalion, the 1st Platoon, Cannon Company, and the\r\nbattalion Antitank Platoon pushed along Highway 1, secured San Roque,\r\nand set up a roadblock. [370] From the 23d to the 26th of October the\r\n1st Battalion, 383d Infantry, patrolled the Labiranan Hill--San Roque\r\narea and protected the right flank of the 96th Division as the rest\r\nof the division slogged through swamps and rice paddies to the south.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBattling the Swamps\r\n\r\nAt 0840 on 21 October the 2d and 3d Battalions, 383d Infantry,\r\nwhich were to go in a northwesterly direction around Catmon Hill\r\nand isolate the Japanese force on the hill, moved out westward. They\r\nadvanced through swamps and rice paddies but met no Japanese during\r\nthe day. At 1640, when they established a night perimeter, the 2d\r\nBattalion was 300 yards north of Tigbao and the 3d Battalion with the\r\nregimental command group was 1,100 yards northeast of the barrio and\r\nsouth of Catmon Hill. [371]\r\n\r\nThe 382d Infantry, while protecting the left flank of the 96th\r\nDivision, was to advance rapidly into the interior and seize\r\nTigbao. [372] During the night of 20-21 October artillery fire from\r\nan unknown source fell in the sector of the 2d Battalion, killing\r\nthree men and wounding eight others. At 0800, on 21 October, the\r\n2d Battalion, 382d Infantry, moved out, followed at 0812 by the 3d\r\nBattalion. These troops, like the 2d and 3d Battalions of the 383d\r\nInfantry, were confronted with waist-deep swamps which made the going\r\nslow and arduous. The 3d Battalion, 382d Infantry, immediately after\r\nmoving out, ran into enemy pillboxes constructed of coconut logs and\r\ndefended by machine guns and riflemen. At first the troops bypassed\r\nthe pillboxes but at 1030 Company K went back and wiped them out. In\r\naddition to the morass through which the troops were moving, numerous\r\nempty pillboxes slowed up the advance, since each of them had to be\r\nchecked. [373] At 1430, because there was a gap between the 2d and\r\n3d Battalions, Colonel Dill committed the 1st Battalion to close the\r\nline. The battalions then advanced abreast and kept lateral contact\r\nwith the 2d and 3d Battalions of the 383d Infantry on their right. At\r\n1630, when the battalions established their night perimeters, they\r\nwere far short of their objective. [374]\r\n\r\nAt 1745 Colonel Dill directed all of the battalions of the 382d\r\nInfantry to move out at 0800 on 22 October--the 1st Battalion was\r\nto capture Tigbao and Bolongtohan and then push on to Hindang; the\r\n2d Battalion was to proceed toward Anibung; and the 3d Battalion,\r\non the right of the 1st Battalion, was to proceed to the northwestern\r\nedge of Bolongtohan. [375]\r\n\r\nSince it was known that the Japanese were strongly entrenched\r\non Catmon Hill, General Bradley had decided to bypass the hill\r\ntemporarily. His plan called for the 2d and 3d Battalions of the\r\n383d Infantry to envelop Catmon Hill from the south and then move\r\nnorth to make contact with the 24th Division at Tanauan. [376] On the\r\nmorning of 22 October, Colonel May of the 383d Infantry asked General\r\nBradley for permission to attack Catmon Hill from the south with his\r\n2d and 3d Battalions. General Bradley refused the request and ordered\r\nColonel May to continue the enveloping movement he had started on\r\n21 October. [377] Later on that morning, therefore, the 2d and 3d\r\nBattalions, 383d Infantry, moved out north-northwest. Encountering\r\na deep swamp at 1130, the troops turned northwest. This move did not\r\nmaterially help the situation, since they found that they had exchanged\r\nthe swamp for rice paddies. The advance units reached Anibung at 1630\r\nwithout encountering any Japanese. By 1800 all units had closed in\r\non the vicinity of Anibung and set up a night perimeter 400 yards\r\nnorth of the barrio.\r\n\r\nFew supplies had been brought forward because the vehicles of the\r\nbattalions had advanced only 200 yards when they bogged down. The\r\ntroops hand-carried their weapons and communications equipment, while\r\ncivilians with about eight carabaos [378] helped carry the supplies. In\r\nthe transportation of supplies forward, ammunition was given priority\r\nover rations and water, even though the supply of the latter items,\r\nwhich had been issued to the troops before landing, was nearly\r\nexhausted. The men made free use of coconuts for food and drink. [379]\r\n\r\nAt 0800 on 22 October the three battalions of the 382d Infantry moved\r\nout. By 0900 the 1st and 2d Battalions had pushed through Tigbao,\r\nwhereupon the regimental commander changed the orders for the day. He\r\nordered the 2d Battalion to take Bolongtohan, the 1st Battalion to\r\nseize Canmangui, and the 3d Battalion to go into reserve. [380]\r\n\r\nThe 1st and 3d Battalions of the 382d Infantry made contact with\r\neach other at 1152. When patrols from the 1st Battalion did not\r\nfind any Japanese at Canmangui, the battalion proceeded toward\r\nBolongtohan. Upon nearing Mati, the 1st Battalion encountered an\r\nentrenched position of the enemy and by outflanking the position\r\nwas able to knock it out. The Japanese fought a delaying action and\r\nwithdrew during the afternoon. At 2000 the battalion formed its night\r\nperimeter at Mati. The other battalions of the regiment encountered\r\nno Japanese during the day's progress inland, and formed their night\r\nperimeters at 1800--the 2d Battalion 800 yards east of Bolongtohan\r\nand the 3d Battalion 500 yards southeast of Tigbao. During the day\r\nthe 382d Infantry had pushed forward approximately 2,000 yards. [381]\r\n\r\nAt 2300 on 22 October General Makino issued an order for the defense\r\nof the island by the Japanese 16th Division. He organized his troops\r\ninto the Northern and Southern Leyte Defense Forces. The Southern\r\nDefense Force was to protect the Dulag-Burauen road and the airfields\r\nin the vicinity of Burauen. It was in the zone of action of the 7th\r\nDivision. The Northern Leyte Defense Force [382] was to remain on\r\nCatmon Hill, the high ground south of Tanauan, and the high ground\r\nsouth of Palo. Elements were to be in the vicinity of Tabontabon and\r\nKansamada, and a unit was to protect the artillery positions north of\r\nCatmon Hill. The 16th Engineer Regiment (less three platoons) was to\r\nbe prepared to demolish the roads connecting Dagami and Burauen and\r\nthose connecting Dagami and Tanauan, in order to check the advance\r\nof American tanks. Simultaneously, the main force of the unit was to\r\nsecure the road running northwest from Dagami to Tingib. The division\r\nreserve and command post were to be in the vicinity of Dagami. [383]\r\n\r\nAt 0900 on 23 October the 2d Battalion, 383d Infantry, sent a patrol\r\nto investigate the enemy situation west of Pikas and near the Guinarona\r\nRiver. At 1130 the patrol reported that there were a few Japanese on a\r\nhill near Pikas. The 2d and 3d Battalions, 383d Infantry, moved out at\r\n1200 with the 2d Battalion in the lead. At 1430 Company G, the leading\r\ncompany, surprised some Japanese who were swimming in the Guinarona\r\nRiver. They were \"literally caught with their pants down.\" [384] The\r\nleading companies were able to rout the enemy and continue the advance\r\ndespite small forays which were broken up; about fifty of the enemy\r\nwere killed. At 1810 the 2d Battalion, 383d Infantry, reached the high\r\nground on the north bank of the Guinarona River, 600 yards west of\r\nPikas. A force of approximately 100 Japanese attacked the battalion\r\nas it was establishing a night perimeter. Fortunately the Americans,\r\njust fifteen minutes before, had put their machine guns and mortars\r\nin position and were thus able to fire their weapons immediately and\r\nrepulse the attack. The 3d Battalion, 383d Infantry, closed in on the\r\narea at 1900 and each battalion set up a perimeter for the night. [385]\r\n\r\nDuring the day the regiment received a small quantity of supplies\r\nby Filipino and carabao trains and by airdrop from Navy planes. The\r\namount of food came to about one-half ration for each man. On the\r\nfollowing day Colonel May ordered the 1st Battalion, 383d Infantry,\r\nto remain in position until a supply route could be established. [386]\r\n\r\nEarly on 24 October General Bradley told Colonel May to hold his\r\npresent positions and sent out patrols to find roads, trails, and\r\nsolid ground that could be used as or converted into supply routes\r\nto the rear. [387] The communications between the regiment and the\r\n96th Division were very hard to maintain, since the only radios the\r\ntroops could move inland were hand-carried sets of short range.\r\n\r\nIn the early morning hours of 25 October a division reconnaissance\r\npatrol, with light tanks and a motorized engineer platoon, went along\r\nHighway 1 with the mission of reconnoitering the highway as far north\r\nas the Binahaan River and making contact with the X Corps. By 1300 the\r\npatrol reached the river near Tanauan and found a damaged bridge. By\r\n1600 the bridge had been repaired and the patrol pushed through Tanauan\r\nand made contact with Company K of the 19th Infantry, 24th Division,\r\nthe first between the X and XXIV Corps since the landing.\r\n\r\nThe 382d Infantry spent 23 October patrolling. Contact was established\r\nand maintained between all of the battalions of the regiment during\r\nthe day. Although the forward movement was slowed to allow much-needed\r\nsupplies to come up, an advance of 600 yards was made. As the regiment\r\nadvanced farther inland it became apparent that the entire area was\r\ncomposed of swamps and rice paddies. The roads were only muddy trails\r\nand were impassable for wheeled vehicles. The M29 cargo carriers and\r\nLVT's were pressed into service to carry supplies, but the numerous\r\nstreams and waist-deep swamps soon halted all vehicular traffic. The\r\ntask of supply and of evacuation of wounded soon assumed staggering\r\nproportions. For days the troops had had little food since priority\r\nhad been given to the indispensable ammunition. Filipino and soldier\r\ncarrying details were the only means by which the front lines could\r\nbe supplied. [388]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of 24 October General Bradley ordered the 382d Infantry\r\nto have its 2d Battalion close in on Anibung. The 3d Battalion was to\r\noccupy Hindang and the 1st Battalion was to proceed through Hindang\r\nto a position about 500 yards farther north. [389]\r\n\r\nAt 0830 the 1st and 3d Battalions, 382d Infantry, moved astride the\r\nnarrow trail that led to Tabontabon, with the 3d Battalion echeloned\r\nto the right rear. The 1st Battalion passed through Bolongtohan at\r\n0930 and moved on in a northwesterly direction toward Hindang. At\r\n1105, as the 1st Battalion was pushing through Hindang, it came under\r\nenemy rifle fire. The Japanese had dug spider holes under the huts,\r\nand a trench extended along the western end of the barrio. The 1st\r\nBattalion, assisted by troops from Company B, 763d Tank Battalion,\r\nmoved through the town, leaving the 3d Battalion the job of mopping\r\nup. The 3d Battalion reached Hindang at 1530 and immediately attacked\r\nthe enemy force there. The Japanese offered only slight resistance\r\nand then fled, abandoning thirty-six well-constructed defensive\r\npositions. At 1610 the barrio was secured.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the 1st Battalion, after driving through Hindang with\r\nCompanies A and G abreast, came upon a strong enemy position some 200\r\nyards beyond the town on the left flank of Company A. A platoon of the\r\nCannon Company and some light tanks had managed to get forward. The\r\ntanks and flame throwers flushed the Japanese into the open where\r\nthey were met by the fire of American riflemen who were waiting for\r\nthem. By 1600 the enemy strong point was secured and the battalion\r\nmoved northwest and formed a night perimeter at 1700.\r\n\r\nThe 2d Battalion reached Anibung without incident. The airfield\r\nbelieved to be in the vicinity of the barrio proved nonexistent. At\r\nthe end of the day the regiment had advanced approximately 2,200\r\nyards. The 2d Battalion was at Anibung, the 3d Battalion was just\r\nbeyond Hindang, and the 1st Battalion was in a position to move\r\nnorthwest against Aslom. [390]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of 25 October the 1st and 3d Battalions, 382d\r\nInfantry, moved out in a northwesterly direction toward Aslom,\r\nwith the 3d Battalion on the right, while the 2d Battalion moved\r\nout in a northwesterly direction toward Kanmonhag. The Japanese had\r\nwithdrawn during the night, leaving only scattered riflemen to oppose\r\nthe advance.\r\n\r\nIn their advance, the battalions were supported by elements of the\r\n763d Tank Battalion. At Aslom the two battalions encountered a strongly\r\nfortified position of five gun emplacements and four pillboxes, which\r\nthe tanks were able to knock out. [391] The 1st Battalion formed its\r\nnight perimeter near Aslom while the 3d Battalion pushed north 1,500\r\nyards and formed its perimeter.\r\n\r\nThe 2d Battalion encountered only abandoned pillboxes on its front and\r\nleft flank during its advance. At 1200 a patrol which reconnoitered\r\nKanmonhag found no resistance, and the battalion pushed on to form\r\nits night perimeter on line with the 3d Battalion. [392]\r\n\r\nDuring the first six days of the operation, the casualties of the\r\n96th Division amounted to 5 officers and 89 enlisted men killed, 17\r\nofficers and 416 enlisted men wounded, and 13 enlisted men missing in\r\naction. [393] In the same period the division had killed an estimated\r\n531 Japanese and had taken one prisoner. [394]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCatmon Hill Area\r\n\r\nBy the end of 25 October the 1st Battalion of the 383d Infantry was\r\nin position to attack Labir Hill, while the 2d and 3d Battalions,\r\nremaining in position near Pikas, had sent vigorous patrols into\r\nTabontabon, San Victor, and San Vicente. The 2d and 3d Battalions\r\nof the 382d Infantry were beyond Aslom while the 1st Battalion was\r\nstill at that point. By this time the supply line had been opened up\r\nand the main swamps had been traversed. The 96th Division was deep\r\nin southern Leyte Valley and had isolated a strong enemy force on\r\nCatmon Hill. The way was now open for the division to launch an attack\r\nagainst Tabontabon, bypass the positions of the 9th Infantry Regiment\r\non Catmon Hill, and secure the remainder of its beachhead area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTaking Tabontabon\r\n\r\nBy 23 October the 383d Infantry, less the 1st Battalion, had\r\ncrossed the Guinarona River and established a position west of\r\nPikas. Having been ordered by General Bradley to hold this position,\r\nthe regiment limited its activities to patrolling. While awaiting\r\norders to advance, Colonel May decided to give battle training to\r\nvarious units by sending them out on patrolling missions to observe\r\nthe enemy. [395] Tabontabon and San Victor were assigned to the 3d\r\nBattalion commander as a training mission for one of his companies,\r\nwhile San Vicente Hill was assigned to the 2d Battalion commander\r\nfor the same purpose. Tabontabon was a key point, since it was one\r\nof the main 16th Division supply centers.\r\n\r\nCompany K, which had been selected by the 3d Battalion commander\r\nfor the first mission, sent patrols into the Tabontabon--San Victor\r\narea on the afternoon of 24 October. The patrol sent to Tabontabon\r\nfound that the 9th Infantry Regiment had extensively fortified the\r\nbarrio. There were deep foxholes and machine gun emplacements dug\r\nin under the houses. None of the positions appeared to be occupied,\r\nbut at the end of the town the patrol saw approximately twenty-five\r\nJapanese preparing their evening meal. Tabontabon was a fairly large\r\nbarrio on the Guinarona River, with several blocks of shops and houses,\r\nincluding a church and several two-story buildings, the axis of the\r\ntown running east and west.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of information brought by the patrol, it was decided to\r\nhave Company K move out the following morning to seize Tabontabon. At\r\n0645 on 25 October Company K, reinforced, advanced and at 0730 took\r\ncovered positions 200 yards east of the barrio. Under the plan for\r\nattack the 1st Platoon was to approach the northeastern edge of the\r\nvillage by a covered route, and await the completion of an artillery\r\nconcentration scheduled for 0800. After the artillery preparation\r\na squad from the platoon was to enter and reconnoiter for possible\r\nenemy positions. At the same time, the 2d Platoon, with a similar\r\nmission, was to enter Tabontabon from the southeast side. The 3d\r\nPlatoon was to be prepared to support the action of either the 1st\r\nor the 2d. Machine guns and mortars were placed in such a way as to\r\ngive direct support to both platoons.\r\n\r\nBecause of unexplained communication difficulties, the artillery did\r\nnot deliver its scheduled fire at 0800. Each platoon, however, sent a\r\nsquad into Tabontabon. As soon as advance elements of both platoons\r\nentered the town they came under intense rifle and mortar fire from\r\nenemy positions under the houses. It was obvious that the Japanese\r\nhad heavily reinforced the barrio during the night. The reinforcements\r\nconsisted of a battalion from the 9th Infantry Regiment. [396]\r\n\r\nThe rest of the 1st and 2d Platoons came up and a fire fight\r\nensued. The 3d Platoon was sent in at 1000 to support the 1st Platoon,\r\nand in response to a request for reinforcements, a rifle platoon from\r\nCompany I was brought up at 1040. The commanding officer of Company K\r\nadvised the 3d Battalion by radio that he could take Tabontabon with\r\nan additional rifle company but could not do so with his present force\r\nwithout suffering heavy casualties. The battalion commander ordered\r\nhim to withdraw. The withdrawal, under supporting fire from the 3d\r\nPlatoon, Company K, the platoon from Company I, and mortar and machine\r\ngun fire from the weapons company, was successfully accomplished at\r\n1155. At 1240 Company K rejoined the battalion.\r\n\r\nGeneral Bradley ordered the 383d Infantry to direct the patrols\r\nof the 3d Battalion elsewhere, since the 382d Infantry had been\r\nassigned the mission of securing Tabontabon. During the forthcoming\r\nattack the 383d Infantry was to protect the flank of the 382d,\r\nwhose 2d and 3d Battalions were to launch a co-ordinated attack on\r\nthe town. On 26 October the 2d Battalion of the 382d Infantry moved\r\nwest and established contact with the 3d at 1200. After an artillery\r\nconcentration had been placed on the town the two battalions moved out.\r\n\r\nBy 1600 they had forded the shoulder-deep Guinarona River under heavy\r\nenemy fire and had reached the edge of Tabontabon. As the battalions\r\nslowly pushed their way to the outskirts of the barrio, they came\r\nunder heavy fire. Elements of the 9th Infantry Regiment had dug in\r\nunder the houses, and connecting trenches honeycombed the streets from\r\none strong point to another. At twilight, after heavy artillery fire,\r\nthe enemy launched a strong counterattack which forced the battalions\r\nto withdraw to the river bank, where they established perimeters for\r\nthe night. [397] Until midnight, mortar fire from the 9th Infantry\r\nRegiment fell in the 2d and 3d Battalion areas.\r\n\r\nAt 2100 the 96th Division artillery commenced firing on the town and\r\ncontinued to fire throughout the night. The 1st Battalion, less Company\r\nB which had been left at Aslom to guard supplies, had by now joined\r\nthe rest of the regiment. At 1000 on 27 October the 382d Infantry\r\nlaunched a co-ordinated attack against Tabontabon with the 2d and 3d\r\nBattalions. As Companies I and K of the 3d Battalion started to wade\r\nthe Guinarona River, Colonel Dill, the regimental commander, called\r\nto the men to follow him and then dashed across the bridge, which\r\nwas swept by enemy rifle fire. The 3d Battalion followed him over the\r\nbridge and to the southeast corner of the barrio. [398] The troops met\r\nconsiderable opposition from elements of the 9th Infantry Regiment who\r\nwere hidden in the tall cogon grass. After a short fire fight the two\r\nbattalions worked their way slowly through the western portion of the\r\ntown and then advanced northwest. Although they met fire from several\r\npillboxes, there was no organized resistance. Night perimeters were\r\nset up about a mile northwest of Tabontabon with the 3d Battalion on\r\nthe left side of the road and the 1st Battalion on the right. [399]\r\n\r\nThe 2d Battalion, which had hit the center of the town, encountered\r\nstiff and determined opposition. Company F proceeded cautiously down\r\none street as Company G went through the middle of the second block\r\non its right. The Japanese had riflemen and machine guns under the\r\nhouses and on the second floors of the large buildings. By noon the\r\ntwo companies had worked their way through to the northern edge of\r\nthe town, where they encountered the enemy entrenched in force.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese had placed machine guns to cover the exits from the\r\nbarrio. The guns were aimed down each street and so placed that each\r\ngun was protected by another. Since in Company G men were dropping\r\nfrom heat exhaustion, Company E was sent in to relieve Company G. At\r\nthe same time, the 2d Platoon of the Cannon Company moved forward,\r\nbut its howitzers were unable to direct their fire effectively. Late\r\nin the afternoon, since it had become apparent that the 2d Battalion\r\nwould not be able to secure the town before nightfall, the troops\r\nwere called back to the center of the town, where the 2d Battalion\r\nset up its night perimeter. [400]\r\n\r\nDuring the night the Japanese counterattacked, but American artillery\r\nand mortar fire broke up the assault. [401] At 0800 on 28 October the\r\n2d Battalion continued the attack and succeeded in knocking out the\r\nenemy resistance northeast of the town, an action which enabled the\r\nbattalion to move out north of Tabontabon at 1200. Leaving Company\r\nG to clear the area immediately outside the town, the 2d Battalion\r\nproceeded along the road toward the road junction at Kiling. [402]\r\nIn spite of determined opposition, the Japanese supply center of\r\nTabontabon had at last been taken and approximately 350 Japanese killed\r\nin the area. During the three days of fighting, the 2d Battalion had\r\nthirty-four men killed and eighty wounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCapture of Catmon Hill\r\n\r\nThe capture of Catmon Hill falls into two separate and distinct\r\nactions--the operations of the 383d Infantry in the San Vicente sector\r\nand the assault of the 381st Infantry against Catmon Hill.\r\n\r\nOn 24 October a Japanese prisoner stated that the fortifications on San\r\nVicente Hill, the northern tip of Catmon Hill, were guarded by elements\r\nof the 9th Infantry and 20th Infantry Regiments of the Japanese 16th\r\nDivision. [403] On the morning of 26 October the regimental commander\r\nordered Company E, 383d Infantry, under Capt. Jesse R. Thomas, to make\r\na reconnaissance in force of San Vicente Hill. [404] Upon receiving\r\nhis orders, Captain Thomas made his plans. The 1st Platoon was to\r\nmove forward and take the left nose of the hill, operating on the\r\nright of the 2d Platoon. The 3d Platoon was to move into an assembly\r\narea fifty yards behind the line of departure.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of 26 October the 155-mm. howitzers of the 363d Field\r\nArtillery Battalion laid a ten-minute concentration on the crest of\r\nthe hill. This fire was ineffective, since it was too far ahead of the\r\ntroops. At 1000 the platoons of Company E moved through the tall cogon\r\ngrass to the edge of an open field approximately 200 yards from the\r\nbase of the hill. The men were under orders not to fire until fired\r\nupon. As the leading elements of the two platoons entered the field,\r\nthe 9th Infantry Regiment opened fire with rifles and mortars. The\r\n3d Platoon then moved up into position along the line of departure,\r\nprepared to support the attack. Since the 2d Platoon was not under\r\nheavy fire, it was ordered to move to the foot of the hill and take\r\na position from which it could support by fire the advance of the 1st\r\nPlatoon. Enemy mortars were dropping shells around the center of the\r\narea, but American mortars silenced them.\r\n\r\nThe 2d Platoon reported that it was 100 yards from the base of the\r\nhill. The 2d Battalion commander, Lt. Col. James O. McCray, moved\r\ninto the company command post, about seventy-five yards behind the\r\nattacking platoons at the edge of the open field. This sector began\r\nto receive heavy fire from the right side of the hill and several\r\nmen on the edge of the field were hit. Colonel McCray crawled up and\r\nstarted to help drag the wounded men to cover. At the same time he\r\nordered the battalion to open fire against the hill with all weapons\r\nexcept artillery, but an undetermined number of enemy riflemen in\r\nthe rear of the command post and on the left flank of the company\r\nstarted firing into the command post.\r\n\r\nColonel McCray continued to bring back wounded men. At this time\r\nCaptain Thomas was overcome by the heat, and the executive officer of\r\nCompany E, 2d Lt. Owen R. O'Neill, took over. He ordered the withdrawal\r\nof the force. It was now 1335 and the company, under continuous fire\r\nsince 1000, had been unable to advance. Captain Thomas revived and\r\nagain assumed command, directing the withdrawal and the bringing\r\nback of the wounded. The body of Colonel McCray, who had sacrificed\r\nhis life while dragging the wounded from the hill, was found about\r\ntwenty yards from the command post. The withdrawal was completed.\r\n\r\nFrom 27 to 29 October, the actions of the 2d and 3d Battalions, 383d\r\nInfantry, were limited to reconnaissance patrols in the vicinity of the\r\ntown of San Vicente and San Vicente Hill in attempts to find the strong\r\npositions of the enemy on the hill. At 0930 on 30 October Colonel May\r\nordered the battalions to renew the attack from positions near the\r\nGuinarona River. The two units jumped off at 1300. The 3d Battalion\r\nadvanced along the north bank of the Guinarona River, one company\r\ngoing through Pikas and the rest of the battalion making a wide swing\r\nthrough a coconut palm grove and open fields. The 2d Battalion moved\r\nalong the south bank of the Guinarona River, one company following a\r\ntrail from Pikas to San Vicente and the rest of the battalion going\r\ndirectly to San Vicente Hill, which was taken without opposition\r\nsince the enemy force had withdrawn. The 3d Battalion went through\r\nthe barrio of San Vicente without difficulty but encountered some\r\nsmall arms fire along the river 300 yards north of the village. Both\r\nbattalions formed their night perimeters near the river.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the eastern slopes of Catmon Hill were being\r\nassaulted by elements of the 381st Infantry, which had been in Sixth\r\nArmy reserve through 26 October. On 27 October Sixth Army had released\r\nthe 381st Infantry to XXIV Corps control. At 1330 on the same day\r\nGeneral Bradley ordered the regiment to relieve on the following day\r\nthe 1st Battalion, 383d Infantry, which had been on Labiranan Head\r\nsince 22 October. It was then to attack and capture Catmon Hill.\r\n\r\nCatmon Hill had been under steady naval and artillery fire since A\r\nDay--20 October. The 96th Division artillery had constantly fired on\r\ntargets of opportunity by day and harassed enemy positions in the area\r\nduring the night. Starting at 2100 on 27 October, the 105-mm. howitzers\r\nof the 361st Field Artillery Battalion, the 155-mm. howitzers of the\r\n198th Field Artillery Battalion, a battery of 155-mm. howitzers from\r\nthe 363d Field Artillery Battalion, and the 75-mm. howitzers from the\r\n780th Amphibian Tank Battalion were to deliver harassing fires on the\r\nhill until 1030 the following day. At that time all of the artillery\r\nunits were to commence firing successive concentrations beginning\r\nat the bottom of the hill and working to the top in fifty-yard\r\nbounds. After the 381st Infantry, less the 3d Battalion, attacked\r\nat 1200 on 28 October, the artillery was to fire concentrations in\r\nfront of the troops as they advanced. [405]\r\n\r\nIn making his plans for the capture of Catmon Hill, Col. Michael\r\nE. Halloran, commander of the 381st Infantry, decided to have the 1st\r\nBattalion make an enveloping movement from the northeast while the\r\n2d Battalion pushed west along the main ridge. The 1st Battalion,\r\n383d Infantry, from its position on Labiranan Head, would support\r\nthe attack by fire. On the morning of 28 October the 381st Infantry,\r\nless the 3d Battalion, moved into position for the attack. After a\r\nthirty-minute preparation by the artillery, the 381st Infantry jumped\r\noff to the attack at 1200.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Battalion, 381st Infantry, moved to the foot of the hill, where\r\nit received \"a bloody nose\" from fire coming out of well-entrenched\r\npositions. It withdrew under cover of smoke and established a night\r\nperimeter in the vicinity of its line of departure. The 2d Battalion,\r\nhowever, met no enemy resistance and advanced rapidly. At the close of\r\nthe day the battalion was just short of Labir Hill. [406] During the\r\nnight the Americans expended 3,000 rounds of artillery ammunition on\r\nCatmon Hill, chiefly in front of the 2d Battalion sector. The plans\r\nfor 29 October called for a morning attack by the 2d Battalion,\r\nsupported by fire from the 1st Battalion, 383d Infantry, which had\r\nnot yet been relieved; the 1st Battalion, 381st Infantry, was to seek\r\na new lane of approach and attack at noon.\r\n\r\nAfter a thirty-minute artillery preparation, the 2d Battalion,\r\n381st Infantry, moved out at 0830. With the support of a platoon\r\nof light tanks, the battalion easily secured both Labir and Catmon\r\nHills. By 1300 the position had been consolidated. The 1st Battalion,\r\n381st Infantry, supported by the massed fire of forty-five tanks\r\nand the Regimental Cannon Company, jumped off at 1200. The troops\r\nmoved through a heavily fortified area, and at 1600 they established\r\nphysical contact with the regiment's 2d Battalion.\r\n\r\nDuring the heavy pounding of Catmon Hill, the main body of Japanese\r\ntroops, the 9th Infantry Regiment, had withdrawn from the hill on\r\n26 October, unknown to the Americans, and rejoined the main force of\r\nthe 16th Division in the Dagami area. [407]\r\n\r\nAt last Catmon Hill had been secured. The 1st Battalion, 383d\r\nInfantry, was relieved and passed to the Sixth Army reserve. The 381st\r\nInfantry's command post was moved north of San Roque, and at 1800 its\r\n3d Battalion rejoined the regiment south of this position. During 30\r\nand 31 October the entire Catmon Hill area was mopped up--fifty-three\r\npillboxes, seventeen caves, and numerous smaller emplaced positions\r\nwere destroyed by demolition charges. The last enemy stronghold\r\nthreatening the landing beaches had been removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConvergence on Kiling\r\n\r\nSince the main force of the 96th Division was centered in the vicinity\r\nof Catmon Hill, General Bradley had decided to secure the northern\r\nlimits of the corps beachhead line--the road running from Tanauan to\r\nDagami--concurrently with the assault on Catmon Hill. On 25 October\r\nColonel Halloran had ordered the 3d Battalion of the 381st Infantry\r\nto move north along Highway 1 to Tanauan and thence southwestward\r\nalong the Tanauan-Dagami road to Dagami. At the same time the 17th\r\nInfantry, 7th Division, was advancing north toward Dagami on the\r\nBurauen-Dagami road. At 0830 on 26 October the reinforced 3d Battalion\r\nof the 381st Infantry moved out. [408] The forward movement was halted\r\nby a bridge that had been mined and partially blown out. The battalion\r\nforded the river and the advance continued without tanks or vehicles,\r\nwhile engineers from the 321st Engineer Battalion deactivated the\r\nmines and repaired the bridge. The tanks and vehicles then rejoined\r\nthe battalion. Two platoons supported by tanks were sent forward\r\nto guard the two bridges south and east of Tanauan. En route, the\r\nplatoons received some machine gun and rifle fire from a hill between\r\nVigia Point and Tanauan. During the night the enemy made his presence\r\nknown by three rounds of mortar fire and by sporadic rifle fire on\r\nthe bridge guards.\r\n\r\nAt 0800 on 27 October the march was renewed. The troops again came\r\nunder fire from the hill between Vigia Point and Tanauan. After\r\na delay of two hours, in which artillery fire was placed on the\r\nhill, the advance continued and the entrance into Tanauan at 1145\r\nwas unopposed. The battalion then turned southwestward along the\r\nTanauan-Dagami road toward Kiling, which is about midway between\r\nTanauan and Dagami. The 3d Battalion had gone about two miles along the\r\nroad when it came under fire from 75-mm. guns, mortars, and machine\r\nguns. Two hours were required for Company A, 763d Tank Battalion,\r\nand two flame-thrower tanks to reduce this resistance. [409] Seven\r\npillboxes and three 75-mm. guns were destroyed and a command post\r\nwas captured. A night perimeter was established on the road, at 1700,\r\nand only sporadic rifle fire occurred during the night.\r\n\r\nAt 0800 the following day the 3d Battalion, 381st Infantry, moved out\r\nand about 1500 the advance element entered Kiling. An attack supported\r\nby Battery C, 361st Field Artillery Battalion, was launched against\r\nthe enemy about 1630. The Japanese countered with heavy machine\r\ngun, mortar, and rifle fire. The attack continued without success\r\nuntil 1800, when the 3d Battalion withdrew under a smoke screen and\r\nestablished a night perimeter about 1,000 yards east of Kiling. Battery\r\nC, 361st Field Artillery, fired intermittently during the night to\r\nprevent any Japanese attack against the perimeter. [410]\r\n\r\nAt 0800 the following morning--29 October--the 3d Battalion, supported\r\nby tanks and artillery, moved out against Kiling. On the outskirts\r\nof the barrio the battalion met stubborn and determined resistance\r\nwhere the Japanese, with machine guns, mortars, and rifles, fought\r\n\"to the last man.\" The resistance was overcome, and by 1500 the\r\nAmericans occupied the town, which was honeycombed with emplacements\r\nand entrenchments. At 1600 the 3d Battalion, 381st Infantry, was\r\nrelieved by the 2d Battalion, 382d Infantry, which had come up\r\nfrom Tabontabon by truck. At 1800 the 3d Battalion, 381st Infantry,\r\nreturned by truck to the area north of San Roque. [411]\r\n\r\nFrom Tabontabon two important roads lead to the Tanauan-Dagami\r\nroad. One of these runs in a northeasterly direction and meets the\r\nTanauan-Dagami road at Kiling; the other goes in a northwesterly\r\ndirection and meets the road at Digahongan about one and a half\r\nmiles east of Dagami. Colonel Dill ordered the 1st and 3d Battalions,\r\n382d Infantry, to pass through Tabontabon on 27 October and then to\r\nproceed northwest along the latter road to Digahongan. They were then\r\nto go northeastward along the Tanauan-Dagami road and at Kiling join\r\nthe 2d Battalion, which was to proceed northeast along the road from\r\nTabontabon to Kiling.\r\n\r\nThe 1st and 3d Battalions, with the 3d Battalion in the lead, moved\r\nout of Tabontabon and advanced about three quarters of a mile to\r\nKapahuan where they established night perimeters. During the night\r\nthe Japanese charged the perimeter of the 1st Battalion. The attack\r\nwas repulsed with only three casualties to the battalion, while about\r\none hundred of the enemy were killed.\r\n\r\nAt 0830 on the 28th the 1st and 3d Battalions jumped off abreast\r\nalong both sides of the narrow road for Digahongan--the 1st\r\nBattalion on the right and the 3d Battalion on the left. At 1200,\r\nwhen the battalions were about two miles northwest of Tabontabon,\r\nthey encountered a strongly fortified position. The 16th Division had\r\nbuilt coconut pillboxes and many spider holes, which were supported by\r\ntwo 70-mm. howitzers and a number of 50-mm. mortars. Flame throwers\r\nand demolition teams, supported by the artillery, knocked out this\r\nfortified area. Taking their dead and wounded, the enemy withdrew. The\r\nAmerican troops then advanced under protection of artillery fire toward\r\nthe road junction at Digahongan, which they reached at 1500. During\r\nthe day the battalions had been harassed by numerous hidden riflemen,\r\nmines, and booby traps.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Battalion was to move east toward Kiling. The 3d received\r\norders to stay and guard the road junction at Digahongan, nicknamed\r\nFoxhole Corners, where it went into night perimeter. At 1600\r\nthe battalion successfully repulsed a counterattack by about 200\r\nJapanese. In the meantime the 1st Battalion moved as far east on the\r\nDigahongan-Kiling road as Kansamada, where it established a night\r\nperimeter. During the night several small enemy groups of six to eight\r\nmen each tried to enter the battalion lines but were driven off. [412]\r\n\r\nThe 3d Battalion spent 29 October in patrolling the area around\r\nDigahongan and guarding the road junction. It broke up one enemy\r\nattack by about thirty men. At 0800 the 1st Battalion moved out from\r\nKansamada toward Kiling against scattered enemy fire but at 1130 the\r\ntroops were stopped by heavy automatic fire which came from pillboxes\r\nastride the road. Shortly afterward the enemy artillery opened up\r\nand the 1st Battalion was forced to withdraw about a thousand yards\r\nto a point where it established a perimeter. [413] During the fight\r\nLt. Col. Jesse W. Mecham, the commanding officer of the battalion,\r\nwas mortally wounded. His last order to the battalion was that the\r\ntroops should not risk their lives to get his body out. [414] That\r\nnight, however, Maj. Joseph R. Lewis, who had assumed command of\r\nthe battalion, led a small party forward and recovered the body of\r\nColonel Mecham.\r\n\r\nDuring the night the 9th Infantry Regiment withdrew. On 30 October\r\nthe 1st Battalion, 382d Infantry, found no opposition during its\r\nadvance forward to Kiling and at 1030 established contact with the\r\n2d Battalion, 382d Infantry. The 2d Battalion, less Company G, had\r\nmoved out of Tabontabon on the northeast road to Kiling on 28 October,\r\nspending the night on the outskirts of the town.\r\n\r\nThe units of the 96th Division spent the next three days in patrolling\r\nand mopping up. The division had secured the beachhead area of the\r\nXXIV Corps in its zone of action. Its units had seized the Catmon Hill\r\nmass, which dominated the landing beaches, had traversed and cleaned\r\nout the inland swamps, and had secured the important communications\r\ncenter and supply dump of Tabontabon and the main portion of the\r\nsignificant Tanauan-Dagami road. Since landing they had killed an\r\nestimated 2,769 Japanese and taken 6 prisoners in their zone of\r\naction. [415] The cost had not been light. Casualties of the 96th\r\nDivision since 25 October had been 13 officers and 132 enlisted men\r\nkilled, 30 officers and 534 enlisted men wounded, and 2 officers and\r\n88 enlisted men missing in action. [416]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nSouthern Leyte Valley: Part Two\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the invasion, the Japanese had reached the conclusion that if\r\nand when the Americans landed on Leyte it would be in the Dulag area,\r\nand their greatest efforts had therefore been directed toward making\r\nthat area impregnable. General Makino, commanding general of the 16th\r\nDivision, had stationed the following units in the Dulag sector: the\r\n20th Infantry Regiment, commanded by Col. Keijiro Hokoda; elements\r\nof the 22d Field Artillery Regiment; the 54th Air Field Company,\r\ncommanded by Comdr. Kazumasa Kumazawa; and the 7th Independent Tank\r\nCompany. [417] At 0300 on 21 October, General Makino withdrew from\r\nthe Dulag area to Dagami and established his command post in that\r\nsector. [418] The effective fire of the preliminary naval bombardment\r\nhad driven the Japanese from the landing beaches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dulag-Burauen Road\r\n\r\nThe beachhead quadrangle of the XXIV Corps was bounded, generally,\r\nby the Dulag-Burauen-Dagami-Tanauan road. The sections of the road\r\nbordering the northern edge of the quadrangle (Dagami to Tanauan)\r\nand the eastern edge (Tanauan to Dulag) were, in general, in the\r\n96th Division zone of action. The southern and western sides of\r\nthe quadrangle were assigned to the 7th Division. The road that ran\r\nalong the coast between Dulag and Tanauan was a one-way thoroughfare\r\nwhich soon disintegrated under the heavy rainfall and military\r\ntraffic. (Map 8)\r\n\r\nBesides the Dulag airstrip, which was approximately one mile west of\r\nthe town, there were three other airfields in the zone of action of\r\nthe 7th Infantry Division. The San Pablo airstrip was approximately\r\nfive miles west of Dulag and two miles east of Burauen. Its runway\r\nextended generally east to west with a width of 164 feet and a length\r\nof 4,920 feet. The field was overgrown with weeds and had not been\r\noccupied by the Japanese. The Bayug airstrip was just north of the\r\nhighway and a half mile east of Burauen. It had a runway approximately\r\n5,000 feet long. The Buri airstrip, the most important one in the\r\n7th Division zone, was about one mile northeast of Burauen, ran in\r\na general east-west direction, and was also 5,000 feet long. [419]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHalfway to Burauen\r\n\r\nGeneral Hodge ordered the 7th Division to capture the Dulag airfield\r\nand then drive west along the Dulag-Burauen road to seize Burauen\r\nand its airfields. After this was done, the division was to turn\r\nnorth along the Burauen-Dagami road and capture Dagami. [420] The\r\n32d Infantry was to protect the division's right (north), maintain\r\ncontact with the 96th Division, and, if necessary, help the 184th\r\nInfantry on its left to secure the Dulag airstrip west of the town of\r\nDulag. Securing the airstrip was to be the main effort of the 184th\r\nInfantry. [421]\r\n\r\nAt the end of A Day (20 October), all the assault battalions of the\r\n32d and 184th Infantry Regiments of the 7th Division were ashore. The\r\n32d Infantry was on the right (north) flank and the 184th Infantry\r\non the left (south) flank. The 32d Infantry had advanced just beyond\r\nHighway 1 in the area northwest of Dulag. [422] The 3d Battalion,\r\n184th Infantry, was on the southern edge of the Dulag airstrip, while\r\nthe 1st Battalion of the regiment was directly left of the 3d, and the\r\n2d Battalion was in reserve. [423] The 3d Battalion, 17th Infantry,\r\nprotecting the left flank of the XXIV Corps, was across the Daguitan\r\nRiver at Dao; [424] the 1st and 2d Battalions of the same regiment\r\nwere to remain in division reserve.\r\n\r\nThe 7th Division had scarcely established itself for the night of\r\n20 October when the Japanese launched two small-scale tank attacks\r\nagainst the perimeter of the division. Since a gap existed between\r\nthe 184th and 32d Infantry Regiments, Company G of the 184th was\r\ncommitted to fill the space. As the men of the company were digging\r\nin for the night, three tanks from the 7th Independent Tank Company\r\ncame down the road and sprayed the area with machine gun fire, but\r\nthe fire was high and there were no casualties. Though the company\r\nfired rifles, bazookas, and mortars against them, the tanks escaped\r\nwithout injury. An hour later, when one of the tanks returned,\r\nit was knocked out and its crew were killed by a rifle grenade. An\r\nenemy scout car then dashed down the road, and its occupants killed\r\ntwo men and wounded three others.\r\n\r\nThe 3d Battalion, 184th Infantry, had established its night perimeter\r\non the edge of the Dulag airfield, with its right flank on the\r\nDulag-Burauen road. At 0130 three Japanese medium tanks moved along\r\nthis road. Pfc. George W. Tilk of Company M stopped one of these,\r\nas it came into range, with one shot from his bazooka. The other\r\ntwo tanks continued down the road but on their return trip they\r\nwere destroyed--one by the battalion supply detail and the other by\r\nPfc. Johnnie Johnson with his bazooka. [425]\r\n\r\nThe uneasy repose of the 7th Division was again broken at 0400 on 21\r\nOctober when six enemy tanks attacked the sector of the 3d Battalion,\r\n184th Infantry. Within thirty minutes the battalion knocked out two of\r\nthe tanks and forced the others to retreat. [426] The next disturbance\r\nwas at 0530 when about fifty Japanese launched a limited counterattack\r\nagainst the night perimeter of Company K, 3d Battalion, 32d Infantry,\r\nwith light machine gun and rifle fire. The Americans broke up the\r\nattack with machine guns, mortars, and artillery. [427] Daylight\r\nrevealed thirty-five enemy dead in front of the company perimeter,\r\nand there was evidence that others had been dragged away.\r\n\r\nMaj. Gen. Archibald V. Arnold, commander, ordered the 184th and 32d\r\nInfantry Regiments of the 7th Division to move west toward the Burauen\r\nairstrips abreast. Since a gap of several hundred yards existed between\r\nthe two regiments, the battalions of the 184th Infantry were ordered\r\nto veer to the right. At 0800 the 7th Division attacked, the 184th\r\nInfantry on the left and the 32d Infantry on the right. There were\r\nfour battalions in the assault, from left to right: 1st Battalion,\r\n184th Infantry; 3d Battalion, 184th Infantry; 3d Battalion, 32d\r\nInfantry; and 2d Battalion, 32d Infantry. [428]\r\n\r\nAs the 2d Battalion, 32d Infantry, moved forward, it encountered\r\nJapanese entrenched in positions along the hedgerows. Knocking\r\nout these positions from hedgerow to hedgerow greatly retarded the\r\nadvance. The 3d Battalion on the left faced an impassable swamp. In\r\norder to establish contact with the 184th Infantry and cover the area,\r\nCompany I moved around the left side of the swamp, and Company L went\r\naround the right; Company K was to cover the gap between the 2d and\r\n3d Battalions until the 2d Battalion could close it.\r\n\r\nThere was an enemy strong point between the 2d and 3d Battalions of\r\nthe 32d Infantry, but since Colonel Logie was anxious to continue the\r\nadvance of the regiment and straighten the line between the battalions,\r\nhe ordered the battalions to bypass the strong point, while the 1st\r\nBattalion under Maj. Leigh H. Mathias was ordered to move from its\r\nassembly area and reduce it. The lines were straightened somewhat,\r\nbut the swamps and the heavy foliage made contact very difficult.\r\n\r\nThe 2d and 3d Battalions came under fire from 75-mm. guns emplaced\r\nin bunkers; tanks reduced these bunkers and the advance continued. A\r\nreport of the 32d Infantry boasts that \"the reduction of pillboxes was\r\nright down our alley.\" [429] By 1520 the 3d Battalion, 32d Infantry,\r\nhad reached the regimental beachhead line; shortly thereafter the 2d\r\nBattalion came abreast of the 3d.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Battalion of the 32d Infantry, however, experienced difficulty\r\nin reducing the bypassed strong point, which it reached in the middle\r\nof the afternoon. The Japanese defenses consisted of one 75-mm. and one\r\nantitank gun emplaced in bunkers and four machine guns in pillboxes;\r\nthese were completely surrounded by an elaborate system of trenches\r\nand foxholes and were occupied by approximately two platoons of\r\nriflemen. [430] When the battalion reached the position, Companies\r\nA and B, with Company A on the right, were on a line behind five\r\nmedium tanks and one M8 self-propelled 75-mm. howitzer from the Cannon\r\nCompany. As the troops moved across an open field toward a hedgerow,\r\nthe Japanese opened fire upon Company A. Company B also received fire\r\nas it moved beyond the hedgerow. After several men had been killed\r\nand others wounded, Company B halted until the Japanese positions\r\ncould be neutralized by the tanks and the howitzer.\r\n\r\nAs the tanks emerged from the hedgerow they came under heavy fire\r\nfrom the Japanese antitank gun. Although some of the tanks were\r\nhit, no serious damage was done; but the howitzer received a direct\r\nhit that set it ablaze and exploded its ammunition. [431] The crew\r\nabandoned the burning vehicle. Pfc. Fedele A. Grammatico crawled\r\nup under enemy fire, removed the machine guns, which were intact,\r\nand brought them safely back behind the lines. In the meantime,\r\nCompany A tried to advance and knock out the enemy antitank gun but\r\nthe Japanese stopped the company with direct fire.\r\n\r\nBoth companies were halted. The struggle resolved itself into a battle\r\nbetween the tanks and the Japanese in entrenched positions. The tanks\r\nfinally silenced the enemy, and the infantrymen moved in with rifles\r\nand bazookas and cleared out the foxholes. After the reduction of\r\nthis strong point, the 1st Battalion tried to overtake the 2d and\r\n3d Battalions. This was not possible, and at 1800 the 1st Battalion\r\nformed its own perimeter.\r\n\r\nThe 184th Infantry found little opposition in its area, but excessive\r\nheat and the difficulty of maintaining communication in the high\r\ncogon grass rendered its progress difficult. At 0900 the regiment\r\nsecured the Dulag airstrip and continued its forward movement against\r\nsporadic rifle and machine gun fire. Contact had been broken with\r\nthe 32d Infantry, and at 1245 a gap of 3,000 yards existed between\r\nthe regiments. At 1515 the 184th Infantry was ordered to hold up its\r\nadvance and establish contact with the 32d. [432] It had advanced\r\napproximately 1,000 yards beyond the division beachhead line.\r\n\r\nOn 21 October an unidentified Japanese soldier wrote in his diary:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Finally the enemy's gunfire and bombardment has reached our field\r\n    and road area (except the runway). Gunfire seems to fade to Dulag\r\n    area during the night. It seems that enemy tanks are approaching\r\n    San Pablo vicinity. We are preparing for them.... Barracks and\r\n    fuel dumps are to be burned. I am awaiting the opportune moment....\r\n\r\n    I feel alive during the night and dead during the day. Though\r\n    life and death are separated by a thin sheet of paper I will not\r\n    die until I see a face of a Yankee. [433]\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the night of 21-22 October all field artillery battalions\r\ndelivered harassing fires, and just before the assault they fired a\r\nfifteen-minute barrage.\r\n\r\nAt 0800 the 32d Infantry moved out to the attack. The 2d Battalion on\r\nthe right faced difficult and swampy terrain lying along the winding,\r\nsteep-banked Calbasag River, which the troops had to cross twelve times\r\nduring the day's advance. In the afternoon a platoon of amphibian\r\ntractors and another of amphibian tanks were sent to the aid of the\r\nbattalion, and engineers from the 13th Engineer Battalion constructed\r\ntemporary bridges over the river when necessary. [434] The 3d Battalion\r\nof the regiment paced its speed of advance with that of the 2d.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the 1st Battalion overtook the others and at 1000\r\nmoved to the right of the 3d Battalion, bringing the three units into\r\nline. Earlier, at 0925, the 3d Battalion was advancing just to the\r\nright of the Dulag-Burauen road when it received enemy artillery fire,\r\nwhich came from four 75-mm. field pieces to the rear of a hedgerow\r\n600 to 700 yards ahead. When the companies reached the hedgerow,\r\nCompany L received heavy fire from four machine guns which had been\r\nemplaced to protect the field pieces.\r\n\r\nLight machine guns and mortars were brought up, and the 31st Field\r\nArtillery Battalion placed a five-minute concentration on the enemy\r\nstrong point. Three tanks from Company C, 767th Tank Battalion, were\r\npoised for an assault. As soon as the artillery lifted its fire, the\r\ntanks dashed forward and destroyed one machine gun and one 75-mm. field\r\npiece immediately. The tanks then covered the rest of the area with\r\nmachine gun fire until Company L moved up and destroyed the remaining\r\ngun positions with rifles and grenades. The action ended at 1240.\r\n\r\nAs the 3d Battalion, 32d Infantry, was destroying the artillery\r\nposition, Company G of the 2d Battalion received heavy enemy machine\r\ngun and rifle fire near the banks of the Calbasag River. The 3d\r\nPlatoon of Company G walked into an ambush of machine guns, which\r\nfired from two pillboxes under native shacks. The platoon was pinned\r\ndown, having suffered ten casualties from the first burst of fire. To\r\nkeep the advance moving, Company G remained behind to knock out the\r\nbunkers while Company F went forward to continue the advance with\r\nCompany E. Since the swamps prohibited the use of tanks, and the\r\nmutually supported pillboxes prevented envelopment, and since the\r\nnearness of friendly troops made the use of artillery dangerous,\r\nall of Company G was held up. The 3d Platoon hugged the ground until\r\ndarkness enabled it to withdraw.\r\n\r\nAt 0900 on 22 October, planes from the Seventh Fleet bombed the\r\nJapanese fortifications in front of the 184th Infantry. As on the\r\nprevious day, the heat, tangled foliage, and deep swamps, rather\r\nthan enemy action, slowed the advance of the regiment. Since the\r\n184th Infantry's rate of advance was more rapid than that of the 32d\r\nInfantry, orders were issued to the 184th after it had moved forward\r\nan additional 2,800 yards to hold its position until the 32d Infantry\r\ncould close the gap. [435] The 184th maintained contact with the 3d\r\nBattalion, 17th Infantry, by means of patrols.\r\n\r\nThe 184th Infantry waited most of the day for the 32d to come\r\nabreast. By 1800 the 1st and 3d Battalions of the 32d Infantry\r\nhad advanced approximately half the distance to Burauen. The 3d\r\nBattalion, 17th Infantry, on the southern flank of the division,\r\nsent out reconnaissance patrols, which encountered small groups of the\r\nenemy 1,000 to 1,200 yards south. The rest of the 17th Infantry moved\r\ninto an assembly area in the vicinity of the Dulag airfield. [436]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChanges in Plans\r\n\r\nOn the evening of 22 October both General Makino, commander of the 16th\r\nDivision on Leyte, and General Arnold, commander of the 7th Division,\r\nmade changes in their plans.\r\n\r\nThe 16th Division was divided into the Northern and Southern Leyte\r\nDefense Forces. The Northern Leyte Defense Force, consisting of\r\nthe 9th Infantry Regiment reinforced by elements of the 22d Field\r\nArtillery Regiment, would defend the Catmon Hill area against the\r\n96th Division. The Southern Leyte Defense Force, which opposed\r\nthe 7th Division, was composed of the 20th Infantry Regiment, less\r\none battalion, the 2d Battalion of the 33d Infantry Regiment, the\r\n7th Independent Tank Company, and two platoons of the 16th Engineer\r\nRegiment. Some troops were to occupy the area in the vicinity of San\r\nPablo and the Calbasag River. The main force was to be centralized in\r\na prepared position near Hindang. Another group was to occupy Julita,\r\nfrom which it would make small night raids. At the same time part\r\nof this force was to operate along the right bank of the Daguitan\r\nRiver, protecting the 16th Division's right flank. Another unit of\r\napproximately 600 troops was composed of the 98th Airfield Battalion,\r\nthe 54th Airfield Company, and air-ground service units. It was\r\nto occupy the key positions--the high ground west of Burauen, the\r\nsouth end of Burauen, and the Buri airfield--and thus prevent the\r\nAmericans from using the airfield and stop the advance of American\r\ntanks along the road. The main strength of the artillery (22d Field\r\nArtillery Regiment, less the 6th Battery) would support the Southern\r\nLeyte Defense Force. The engineers were to be prepared to demolish the\r\nroad between Dagami and Burauen and between Dagami and Tanauan. The\r\nmain force of the engineers was to secure the road connecting Dagami,\r\nHiabangan, Rizal, and Tingib. A naval unit was to protect a supply\r\ndump east of Dagami, and all remaining units, together with the 16th\r\nDivision command post, would occupy positions in the vicinity of\r\nDagami. [437]\r\n\r\nThree of the four airfields in the zone of the XXIV Corps were in\r\nthe vicinity of Burauen. General Arnold wished to seize them as\r\nsoon as possible, and at the same time he was anxious to advance so\r\nrapidly that the Japanese would not have time to construct additional\r\nfortified positions near the airfields. He accordingly rearranged\r\nthe assault troops. The 17th Infantry, less the 3d Battalion, with\r\nthe 2d Battalion, 184th Infantry, attached, was ordered to pass\r\nthrough the 184th and 32d Infantry Regiments at 0830 on 23 October,\r\nattack west astride the Dulag-Burauen road, and capture the San Pablo\r\nairfield. The 767th Tank Battalion, in support of the regiment, was\r\neither to precede the 17th Infantry or to operate with it, as the\r\nterrain permitted. It was to jump off from the vicinity of the Dulag\r\nairfield thirty minutes earlier than the assault units of the 17th\r\nInfantry. The 32d and 184th Infantry Regiments were to follow 1,000\r\nyards behind the 17th. [438] It was hoped that this \"flying wedge\"\r\nformation would catch the Japanese off balance and that the rear\r\nelements of the wedge would be able to take care of any disorganized\r\nenemy units that had been bypassed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn to Burauen\r\n\r\nThe flying wedge was very successful. The tanks of the 767th Tank\r\nBattalion moved out at 0730 on the morning of 23 October. Though\r\none of the tanks was knocked out about 3,000 yards west of Julita\r\nat 1000, the others reached the western edge of Burauen at 1712 and\r\nscattered the enemy forces in that area. At 0800 the assault units\r\nof the 17th Infantry jumped off, 400 yards to the rear of the tank\r\nbattalion. Because of the narrow front the column of troops was\r\nelongated, and it was not until shortly after 0900 that the 1st\r\nBattalion, 32d Infantry, was able to move forward. Because of the\r\ndifficult terrain and the blazing heat, the infantrymen experienced\r\ndifficulty in keeping up with the tanks. The troops encountered\r\nsporadic opposition during the day, passed rapidly through the\r\nbarrios of Julita and San Pablo, and secured San Pablo airfield. At\r\n1115 General Arnold notified Colonel Logie that the 32d Infantry was\r\nto be responsible for the right flank of the 7th Division's zone of\r\naction, less the 200-yard front covered by the 17th Infantry.\r\n\r\nAt 1700 the units prepared their night perimeters, the 1st Battalion of\r\nthe 32d, 400 yards south of the San Pablo airstrip; the 3d Battalion,\r\n1,500 yards north of Julita; and the 2d Battalion in division reserve,\r\n500 yards southeast of Julita. [439] At the same time the 17th\r\nInfantry was on the west end of the San Pablo airfield. [440] The 184th\r\nInfantry, minus the 2d Battalion, was south of the highway between San\r\nPablo and Julita. During the day's action, the commanding officer of\r\nthe Japanese 20th Infantry Regiment was killed. [441] The action for\r\nthe next few days resolved itself into two separate engagements--the\r\nseizure of the Buri airstrip and the battle for Dagami.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecuring the XXIV Corps Beachhead Line\r\n\r\nBurauen\r\n\r\nThe 7th Division attacked at 0830 on 24 October, using the same\r\nformation employed on the previous day except that the 1st Battalion,\r\n184th Infantry, reverted to regimental reserve. The 1st and 2d\r\nBattalions, 17th Infantry, continued along the road to Burauen; the\r\n32d Infantry crossed San Pablo airfield and then went to the right in a\r\nnorth-northwest direction toward the Buri airstrip. The 2d Battalion,\r\n17th Infantry, fought its way through the northeastern part of the\r\ntown of Burauen and managed to reach the road to Dagami. As the main\r\npart of Burauen is south and west of the road, the barrio was in the\r\nzone of the 1st Battalion, 17th Infantry, which was advancing along\r\nthe left side of the road.\r\n\r\nThe 17th Infantry reached the edge of Burauen at 1030. As the troops\r\nexplored the situation, they found that though there was no organized\r\nresistance in the town, scattered throughout Burauen were elements of\r\nthe 20th Infantry Regiment, dug in under the buildings in spider holes\r\nand armed with satchel charges, Bangalore torpedoes made of bamboo,\r\nand antitank mines. [442]\r\n\r\nAs the American tanks moved through the barrio, some of the Japanese\r\njumped out of their spider holes and held explosive charges against\r\nthe tanks in an attempt to destroy them at the cost of their own\r\nlives. The assault forces of the 17th Infantry, despite the difficulty\r\nof flushing the enemy from the spider holes under the buildings, made\r\nsteady progress and by 1400 had mopped up and secured the town. The\r\nbattalions re-formed and were ready to go north to Dagami.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Buri Airstrip\r\n\r\nAt 0800 on 24 October, Colonel Logie was transferred to the\r\nheadquarters of the 7th Division and Lt. Col. John M. Finn assumed\r\ncommand of the 32d Infantry. Colonel Finn ordered the 1st Battalion,\r\n32d Infantry, to advance to positions across the San Pablo airfield\r\nand then continue the attack northwest toward the Buri airstrip. The\r\n2d Battalion remained in division reserve.\r\n\r\nThe Buri airfield was northeast of Burauen, with a heavily wooded\r\narea on its northern edge. On the northern and western edges the\r\nJapanese had constructed pillboxes in the high grass and heavy brush,\r\ntogether with mutually supporting machine gun pillboxes interlaced\r\nwith extensive trench systems. On the southern side of the airstrip\r\nthe enemy had twenty strong field fortifications. Approximately\r\n1,000 enemy troops were defending the sector--elements of the 20th\r\nInfantry Regiment, the 98th Airfield Battalion, and the 54th Airfield\r\nCompany. The airfield had been extensively mined with 100-pound\r\naerial bombs buried nose up in the runway and scattered throughout\r\nthe dispersal area. Some of these bombs had electric fuzes and could\r\nbe detonated by enemy troops hidden in foxholes a short distance\r\naway. [443]\r\n\r\nThe 1st Battalion, 32d Infantry, met no resistance as it moved out\r\nfrom the vicinity of the San Pablo airstrip at 1123, but when the\r\nbattalion was 1,000 yards northwest of the airfield it ran into\r\nwell-camouflaged enemy positions. About 1400 the battalion attacked\r\nthe emplacements with Company A on the right, Company C on the left,\r\nand Company B in reserve on the right rear of Company A. In the face\r\nof intense enemy resistance, Company A moved forward and placed heavy\r\nrifle and machine gun fire on the Japanese positions, which crumpled\r\nunder the attack. [444]\r\n\r\nAlthough Company C fought valiantly to keep abreast of Company A,\r\nthe bulk of the enemy strength was in front of it. Heavy machine gun\r\nfire on its left flank and in front pinned the company down and kept\r\nit from moving forward. This delay created a gap between the two\r\ncompanies which a platoon from Company B was ordered to fill.\r\n\r\nWhen he found that Company C could not move, Major Mathias, commander\r\nof the 1st Battalion, started out to locate Company A but was wounded\r\nbefore he could reach it. Maj. Robert C. Foulston, Jr., the battalion's\r\nexecutive officer, assumed command of the battalion as Major Mathias\r\nwas evacuated.\r\n\r\nIntense enemy rifle and machine gun fire hit both of the flanks and\r\nthe front of Company C and forced the company to start a confused\r\nwithdrawal. The 2d Platoon pulled back, but four of its men were cut\r\noff from the others and went the wrong way. These men, picking up\r\nanother who was seriously wounded, proceeded three quarters of a mile\r\nbehind the Japanese lines before they discovered their mistake. To\r\ncover the withdrawal of the rest of the company a holding force,\r\nconsisting of one platoon from Company C and one platoon from Company\r\nB, together with a section of heavy machine guns, was set up about\r\n500 yards to the rear of Company C.\r\n\r\nAs Company C started its withdrawal, the enemy moved forward. Keeping\r\nwell concealed, the Japanese edged forward and laid down a heavy volume\r\nof rifle, machine gun, and mortar fire on the troops, but the holding\r\nforce stopped the advance. An intense fire fight broke out in which\r\nboth sides suffered many casualties. The Americans held on grimly.\r\n\r\nAt 1530 Colonel Finn ordered the 3d Battalion, 32d Infantry, to move\r\nto the left of the 1st Battalion, but the swamps and heavy foliage\r\nmade progress slow. By 1630 the 3d Battalion was 600 yards to the\r\nleft rear of the 1st Battalion.\r\n\r\nDuring the fight Colonel Finn went forward. Grasping the seriousness\r\nof the situation, he ordered the 1st Battalion to withdraw to San\r\nPablo airstrip and sent one platoon of the 3d Battalion to assist\r\nthe 1st Battalion in its withdrawal. The rest of the 3d Battalion was\r\nto protect the withdrawal of the 1st. The troops rapidly carried out\r\nthe orders and withdrew to the airstrip. The 2d Battalion, released\r\nfrom division reserve that evening, moved up on line with the 3d\r\nBattalion. The 32d Infantry formed a defensive perimeter for the\r\nnight. [445]\r\n\r\nDuring the day the 2d Battalion, 32d Infantry, captured a Japanese\r\nprivate, Isamu Nakamaru, who had been a mechanic with the 7th\r\nIndependent Tank Company. He informed his captors that his company\r\noriginally had eleven tanks. Eight of these were lost in the action\r\nnear Julita; the others were at Buri but were out of commission. All\r\nthe tanks were obsolete and had been used mainly to clear and roll\r\nthe airstrips. [446]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of 25 October the 49th Field Artillery Battalion fired\r\nconcentrations from 0800 to 0830 in front of the 32d Infantry and\r\ncovered an area of 400 yards on each side of the Buri airstrip. [447]\r\nAt 0700 the 3d Battalion moved to the right and in front of the\r\n1st. The 32d Infantry was to move out at 0830 with the 2d and 3d\r\nBattalions abreast, each battalion to be preceded by a platoon\r\nof tanks.\r\n\r\nAt 0830 the battalions attacked, both advancing 1,500 yards before\r\nthey encountered any serious obstacle. The 2d Battalion on the right\r\nran into the system of bunkers that protected the Buri airstrip. The\r\n3d Battalion halted and waited for the 2d to overcome the bunkers and\r\nmove forward. Though an antitank gun was brought up to fire on the\r\nbunkers, two futile attacks were launched against them and it became\r\napparent that the 2d Battalion would be considerably delayed. Colonel\r\nFinn therefore ordered the 3d Battalion to advance and secure the\r\nedge of the Buri airstrip, and, with its reserve company, to close\r\nthe gap thus created.\r\n\r\nColonel Finn also ordered the 1st Battalion to move closer to the\r\nright flank of the 3d and prevent an enemy envelopment. Meanwhile,\r\nstrong patrols which the 3d Battalion had sent to within 300 yards\r\nof the airstrip reported that they had encountered only one strong\r\npoint in the 3d Battalion's zone of advance. In order that the 3d\r\nBattalion could be certain it was moving in the direction of the\r\nairstrip, Colonel Finn requested an artillery liaison plane to drop\r\na flare over the southwest edge of the airfield. After this was done\r\nthe battalion resumed its attack and at 1700 reached the edge of the\r\nairstrip. Fortunately the battalion immediately went into a defensive\r\nposition, for at 1715 a sharp enemy assault had to be repulsed with\r\nmachine gun and rifle fire. [448]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the 2d Battalion probed at the bunkers located at the edge\r\nof the heavy woods on the northern fringe of the Buri airfield. These\r\ndefenses consisted of three bunkers connected by an elaborate system\r\nof trenches and spider holes. Both flanks of the 2d Battalion received\r\nmachine gun fire, which became heavier upon any attempt to carry out an\r\nenveloping movement. Under cover of fire from American heavy machine\r\nguns, the 2d Battalion withdrew its wounded. It then formed a night\r\nperimeter and waited for heavier supporting weapons to be brought up.\r\n\r\nOn the following day the 2d Battalion was to move from its night\r\nperimeter on a 400-yard front and secure the western end of the\r\nairstrip. The 3d Battalion, 32d Infantry, was to follow the 1st\r\nBattalion and protect the regiment from an attack from the north. Each\r\nof the assault battalions was to have attached a platoon of medium\r\ntanks and a platoon from the Cannon Company. [449]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of 26 October, the 49th Field Artillery Battalion for\r\nten minutes concentrated its fire for 500 yards on each side of the\r\nairstrip. At 0800 the 32d Infantry attacked. The artillery fire had\r\nbeen effective, and the 2d Battalion knocked out the pillboxes that had\r\nstopped its advance the previous day. Aided by tanks, the battalion was\r\nable to advance 700 yards along the south side of the airstrip by 1700.\r\n\r\nThe 1st battalion, on the right, passed through the 3d and attacked\r\nwest on the north side of the airstrip on a 400-yard front toward the\r\nother end of the airstrip. The 1st Battalion immediately encountered\r\na highly intricate system of pillboxes and bunkers, which slowed the\r\nattack until the tanks arrived. From that time on, a fiercely contested\r\nstruggle continued throughout the afternoon. The battalion employed\r\ntanks, antitank guns, artillery, and mortars to cover its advance,\r\nand destroyed many bunkers with grenades, demolition charges, and\r\nautomatic rifles. [450]\r\n\r\nCompany B bore the brunt of the assault and, fighting tenaciously,\r\nhad battled through 900 yards of the fortified area by 1700. The 1st\r\nand 2d Battalions made contact on the edge of the airstrip and formed\r\ntheir night perimeters; the 3d Battalion protected the rear. During\r\nthe night the 32d Infantry repulsed several light counterattacks.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, 27 October, the time for the attack was set\r\nan hour earlier in the hope that the Japanese would be caught off\r\nguard. At 0700 the 32d Infantry moved out, with the assault battalions\r\nin the same formation as on the previous day. [451] To their happy\r\nsurprise the troops encountered little opposition as they readily\r\nsecured bunker after bunker. The 20th Infantry Regiment had spent\r\nits strength. The American troops found enemy dead \"in every bunker,\r\ntrench, foxhole and bush,\" and wreckage of enemy 75's, machine guns,\r\ngrenade launchers, and rifles was scattered about. More than 400\r\nJapanese dead were found in the sector of the 1st Battalion. [452]\r\nThe infantrymen encountered only an occasional rifleman while mopping\r\nup. By 1130 the Buri airstrip was secured.\r\n\r\nOn 28 October the 2d Battalion was alerted to move to Abuyog at\r\n0400 on the following day. The 3d Battalion was ordered to move to\r\nGuinarona for possible attachment to the 17th Infantry, which had\r\ncommitted all three of its battalions in the fight north along the\r\nBurauen-Dagami road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn to Dagami\r\n\r\nAfter securing the barrio of Burauen at 1300 on 24 October, the\r\n17th Infantry had rested for an hour before attacking along the\r\nBurauen-Dagami road. [453] The 2d Battalion, 184th Infantry, remained\r\nattached to the 17th. As the 17th Infantry started north, a patrol\r\nof four jeeps was sent ahead to reconnoiter. It encountered a strong\r\nforce of the enemy on a road that forked off to the Buri airfield, and\r\nafter a short but determined fire fight the enemy withdrew north. On\r\nits return the patrol reported that the road to Dagami had been mined\r\nwith aircraft bombs that were buried nose up in the road and covered\r\nwith palm fronds and other vegetation. A platoon from Company A, 13th\r\nEngineer Battalion, removed the mines and the column continued forward.\r\n\r\nAbout 1530 the right flank of the 17th Infantry came under mortar and\r\nmachine gun fire which came from a ridge north of Burauen and east of\r\nthe road to Dagami. The ridge was about 700 yards long, 50 feet high,\r\nheavily wooded, and covered with dense undergrowth. Most of the fire\r\nseemed to be coming from an eastern spur that overlooked the Bayug\r\nand Buri airfields. On the left (west) of the road the terrain was\r\nflat and marshy.\r\n\r\nAt 1630 the 17th Infantry began to form its night perimeter on the\r\nsouthern edge of the ridge. The 1st Battalion protected the left (west)\r\nflank and tied in at the road with the regiment's 2d Battalion. The\r\nlines of the 2d Battalion, 17th Infantry, covered the forward line\r\nof the ridge that extended to the rear where the 2d Battalion, 184th\r\nInfantry, held the entrance to the eastern finger. The perimeter of\r\nthe 2d Battalion, 184th Infantry, extended south to tie in with the\r\n1st Battalion, 17th Infantry.\r\n\r\nOnly the 1st Battalion, 17th Infantry, was able to set up its night\r\nperimeter without incident. The 2d Battalion, 184th Infantry, ran\r\ninto determined resistance but was able to establish a firm bivouac\r\nfor itself, using the vacated enemy positions. The 2d Battalion,\r\n17th Infantry, received scattered rifle fire but did not encounter\r\nany of the enemy. During the night the 2d Battalion, 184th Infantry,\r\nand the 2d Battalion, 17th Infantry, were harassed by patrols of ten\r\nto twenty Japanese each, probing for a break in the lines.\r\n\r\nShortly after nightfall there were two abortive charges against the\r\nAmerican lines. As soon as the troops heard the enemy, they called for\r\nprotective fire, which prevented any of the Japanese from entering the\r\nlines. The enemy, however, continually fired into the area throughout\r\nthe night. Earlier in the day an American tank had bogged down in a\r\nswamp to the left of the road, and the crew was forced to abandon it\r\nunder fire, leaving the guns intact. During the night the Japanese\r\ncaptured the tank and sprayed the areas of the 1st Battalion, 17th\r\nInfantry, and the regimental command post with the tank's 37-mm. and\r\nmachine guns, and with four of their own machine guns. Fortunately\r\nthe bullets passed harmlessly over the heads of the troops.\r\n\r\nDuring the night Lt. Col. Francis T. Pachler discussed plans for\r\nthe following day, 25 October, with his battalion commanders. He was\r\nfaced with a choice between two courses of action. On the one hand,\r\nhe could take advantage of the tactical surprise occasioned by his\r\nrapid advance, attempt to bypass the Japanese forces on the ridge,\r\nand make a dash along the Burauen-Dagami road, disregarding losses\r\nthat might be inflicted on his flank; or, on the other hand, he could\r\ndestroy the enemy forces on the ridge before advancing to Dagami. The\r\nfirst alternative must allow for a strong possibility that fire from\r\nthe 32d Infantry, which was pushing west, might fall upon the 17th\r\nInfantry if it continued its advance before the Buri airfield was\r\nsecured. After prolonged discussion, Pachler decided to destroy the\r\nenemy forces on the ridge before proceeding to Dagami.\r\n\r\nColonel Pachler therefore ordered the 1st Battalion, 17th Infantry,\r\nto remain in its present position until the 2d Battalion, echeloned to\r\nits right rear, could swing up on line facing north. While waiting\r\nfor the 2d Battalion to move up, the 1st Battalion would send a\r\nstrong reconnaissance patrol along the road north to the barrio\r\nof Buri to determine Japanese strength, and the condition of the\r\nroad and terrain. The 2d Battalion, 184th Infantry, would attack and\r\ndestroy the enemy force on the finger of the ridge and then come up,\r\nalso facing north.\r\n\r\nThe patrol moved out at 0730 on 25 October. A rifle platoon mounted\r\nthe tops and sides of five tanks and headed north towards Buri. On\r\nits way, the platoon encountered and killed Japanese troops who were\r\nemplaced in spider holes and coconut log pillboxes under buildings,\r\nbut a destroyed bridge at the edge of Buri prevented any further\r\nadvance. The platoon returned at nightfall with the report that the\r\nroad to Buri was clear and that it had killed forty-nine of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe 2d Battalion, 17th Infantry, made its move without incident. The 2d\r\nBattalion, 184th Infantry, advancing from its position on the heavily\r\nwooded eastern finger of the ridge, was forced to meet and destroy the\r\nenemy force with bayonets and grenades. Its progress was slow until\r\na platoon of the Cannon Company and a platoon of medium tanks made\r\na wide encircling movement through the Bayug airstrip and were able\r\nto bring fire to bear on the Japanese. By 1300 the enemy threat was\r\nremoved and the battalion commenced its swing to the north to join\r\nthe other two battalions. At dusk the three units were in line; the\r\ncombat teams had advanced 400 yards and formed their night perimeters.\r\n\r\nAt 1700 Colonel Pachler rearranged his troops and made plans for the\r\nfollowing day. The 2d Battalion, 184th Infantry, was detached to guard\r\nthe ridge. The 3d Battalion, 17th Infantry, which had been guarding the\r\ndivisional left flank south of Dao since A Day, was brought forward\r\nby truck to rejoin the regiment. The 17th Infantry would move out\r\nalong the highway in a column of battalions--the 1st, 2d, and 3d. [454]\r\n\r\nThe 1st Battalion, 17th Infantry, moved out at 0700, Company A on\r\nthe left (west) and Company C on the right (east). Since the tanks\r\nwere forced to remain on the road because of swamps on either side,\r\ntank support was reduced to a platoon. After having moved about 300\r\nyards beyond the line of departure, Company C ran into a small pocket\r\nof enemy resistance which it soon destroyed with hand grenades and\r\nsmall arms fire; twenty-one of the enemy were killed and one was\r\ncaptured. Company A also met and overcame some resistance from\r\nenemy in foxholes in its zone, but was not held up. At 1000 the\r\n1st Battalion received machine gun fire to its front and observed a\r\nmovement in the marsh on its right flank. When the heavy machine guns\r\nand 81-mm. mortars were brought to bear upon the marsh, approximately\r\nsixty Japanese began to run across the open fields. The 4.2-inch\r\nmortars of the 91st Chemical Company also fired on the fleeing enemy.\r\n\r\nWhen the forward elements were about 1,100 yards south of Ginogusan,\r\nCompany A encountered a rice paddy to its front. One platoon of the\r\ncompany went left to move around the rice field, and the support\r\nplatoon was committed to close the gap thus created. As the leading\r\nelements got past the field, an enemy force, which was entrenched just\r\nbeyond it, started firing. The rear elements of the 1st Battalion\r\nimmediately closed in and killed fifteen of the enemy with grenades\r\nand small arms fire. In the meantime, Company C encountered about\r\ntwenty-five Japanese who had dug in under native shacks. Two tanks were\r\ncalled up, and after they had knocked over the shacks the infantrymen\r\nclosed in and destroyed the enemy.\r\n\r\nDuring this action the 3d Platoon of Company F, 2d Battalion,\r\n17th Infantry, reinforced by one squad of the antitank platoon of\r\nthe battalion Headquarters Company, established a roadblock on one\r\nof the roads that led to the Buri airfield. The troops came under\r\nrifle and machine gun fire from their front. Within a few minutes\r\nthe platoon leader and two other men were killed and another man was\r\nwounded. The platoon withdrew about one hundred yards and called for\r\nan 81-mm. mortar concentration on the area. The rest of Company F\r\nwas committed against the Japanese south flank.\r\n\r\nIn the face of heavy fire Company F pushed through the difficult\r\nterrain and forced the enemy to withdraw. However, four Japanese\r\nmachine guns remained in position and fired into the company. The\r\nleader of the antitank squad, though wounded in both legs, ran back to\r\nthe battalion command post and asked for tanks in support. A cannon\r\nplatoon which was sent up silenced the enemy guns. While continuing\r\nthe fight during the enemy withdrawal, the company evacuated its\r\nwounded on improvised bamboo litters.\r\n\r\nCompany F was then relieved by the 2d Battalion, 184th Infantry,\r\nwhich established a roadblock nearer the main highway. Company F\r\nrejoined its battalion and the regiment formed its night perimeter\r\nabout 600 yards south of Guinarona. The night was comparatively\r\npeaceful except for a minor bombing in the 2d Battalion area. The\r\ntroops of the 17th Infantry were ordered to move out on 27 October\r\nin a column of battalions in the following order: 3d, 2d, and 1st,\r\nwith a distance of 500 yards between battalions. [455] Since aerial\r\nphotographs showed that all the bridges had been blown, a platoon of\r\nthe 13th Engineer Battalion was attached to the 3d Battalion.\r\n\r\nAt 0700 the regiment moved out, with the 3d Battalion in the lead,\r\non a 100-yard front on both sides of the highway. The tanks were\r\nforced to stay on the road. The 3d Battalion was able to cross a small\r\nstream south of Guinarona, although the bridge had been damaged. When\r\nit reached the northern bank of the stream the battalion ran into the\r\nenemy. Approximately twenty Japanese were dug in around a schoolhouse,\r\nwith two machine guns mounted in the building. Company K, the lead\r\ncompany, under cover of machine gun and mortar fire, successfully\r\nstormed the schoolhouse and killed seventeen of its defenders. The\r\nengineer troops from the 13th Engineer Battalion advanced and quickly\r\nrepaired the bridge, after which the rest of the 17th Infantry moved\r\nforward. Since the bridge north of Guinarona was also damaged, the same\r\ntactics were used. The infantrymen of the lead company crossed the\r\nstream and stood guard while the engineers repaired the bridge. For\r\n2,500 yards the advance continued, unopposed except for small groups\r\nof Japanese. The heavy machine guns of the regiment fired from the\r\nflanks of the American forces and covered the swamps on both sides\r\nof the road. The 17th Infantry went into night perimeter about 2,200\r\nyards south of Dagami and about 200 yards south of a demolished stone\r\nbridge. As the regiment started to dig in, enemy rifle and machine\r\ngun fire fell on the front of the 3d Battalion but mortars returned\r\nthe fire and silenced the enemy. Although there was sporadic air and\r\nground activity during the night, no attempt was made to penetrate\r\nthe lines of the regiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEntrance Into Dagami\r\n\r\nThe 17th Infantry learned from Japanese prisoners that in addition\r\nto elements of the 20th Infantry Regiment in the Dagami sector, the\r\nfollowing units were present: the 2d Battalion, 33d Infantry Regiment\r\n(about 200 men), together with scattered elements of the 16th Engineer\r\nRegiment and the 9th Infantry Regiment. [456]\r\n\r\nThe Japanese had firmly established themselves in positions in\r\ndepth about 1,000 yards south of Dagami. These defenses consisted\r\nof mutually supporting pillboxes made of logs and sandbags, from\r\nwhich the Japanese could deliver interlocking bands of machine gun\r\nfire. They were situated on higher ground and could be approached\r\nonly across open rice paddies. [457]\r\n\r\nAs the American forces came close to Dagami, the 17th Infantry was\r\nmoving north along the Burauen-Dagami road, and the 382d Infantry,\r\n96th Division, was approaching the road between Dagami and Tanauan.\r\n\r\nLt. Col. Kakuda, the commander of the Japanese Central Area Unit of\r\nthe 20th Infantry Regiment, issued a series of operational orders. At\r\n1800 on 27 October he ordered the 20th Infantry Regiment to take a\r\nposition southwest of Dagami and annihilate the Americans. [458]\r\n\r\nThe 17th Infantry estimated that there were from 1,500 to 2,500\r\nJapanese in the vicinity to oppose the regiment's advance and that\r\nabout 500 of these withdrew from Dagami in orderly fashion. [459]\r\nThe commander of the 17th Infantry prescribed a column of battalions\r\nfor the attack of 28 October. The 2d Battalion would pass through the\r\n3d Battalion, and the attack north would be in the order of 2d, 1st,\r\nand 3d. All of the supporting arms were attached to the 2d Battalion\r\nfor its attack. [460]\r\n\r\nAt 0730 the 2d Battalion attacked and immediately met very strong\r\nopposition. The stone bridge and road were in the middle of a strip\r\nof waist-deep swamp 100 yards wide, which funneled out to form a\r\nlarger swamp. A crescent-shaped coconut grove lay beyond the swamp,\r\none end in front of the road and the other bent to the south about 800\r\nyards west of the road. The road and the curve in the coconut grove\r\ndivided the swamp into three segments--one on each side of the road,\r\nand the third west of and parallel to the road. In the face of intense\r\nrifle, machine gun, and mortar fire coming from an unknown number of\r\nJapanese, Company F and three tanks managed to cross the creek. The\r\ntanks continued north up the road. As Company F waded through the\r\nwaist-deep swamp, it pushed through direct enemy fire and past a large\r\ntank trap and found a line of pillboxes to its front and left flank.\r\n\r\nThe company commander ordered his unit to hold its position and then\r\nreturned south of the bridge to bring up more tanks. The 1st Platoon\r\nof Company F moved to the left rear to protect that flank, which was\r\nreceiving considerable enemy fire. As the company commander rushed\r\nback to get the tanks, about twenty Japanese attacked the 1st Platoon\r\nin an attempt to envelop the left flank of the company. The platoon\r\nleader ordered his men to hold their fire until the enemy was only five\r\nyards away, and nearly all of the Japanese were killed in the initial\r\nvolley. The platoon held its ground to prevent any further enveloping\r\nattempts by the Japanese. Meanwhile, Company F's commanding officer\r\nfound that no tanks were available, since they could not cross the\r\nweakened bridge. He returned to Company F and ordered it to retire\r\nto the tank trap, reorganize, and evacuate the wounded.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, in order to relieve the pressure on Company G\r\n(on the right), which had run into somewhat the same situation,\r\nLt. Col. William B. Moore, the battalion commander, committed Company E\r\nto the right (east) flank. Company E initially encountered determined\r\nopposition but managed to flank the enemy and assist Company G in\r\nits sector. At the same time the engineer troops of the 13th Engineer\r\nBattalion, working feverishly under heavy fire, tried to repair the\r\ndamaged bridge. One of the armored bulldozers lost three drivers,\r\nsuccessively, to enemy fire.\r\n\r\nUnder the close supervision of Colonel Moore, who was in the front\r\nlines, the 2d Battalion pressed the attack. Two M8 armored cars were\r\nbrought wide around the right flank in order to avoid the swamp. With\r\ntheir aid, Companies E and G rolled up the east flank of the 20th\r\nInfantry Regiment and broke through the pillboxes in their own area.\r\n\r\nCompany C was committed to the left of Company F in order to aid\r\nit. Although this move was partially successful, Company C found\r\nitself pinned down by an enemy force entrenched in pillboxes and\r\nzigzag trenches. Since the Japanese defense line extended beyond the\r\nregiment's left (west) flank and around it to the south, Company B was\r\ncommitted further left to hit the southern flank of the enemy. Although\r\nCompany B could not break through the line, it was able to locate\r\nthe enemy right flank and neutralize the fire on that flank.\r\n\r\nOne of the three tanks that had gone north in the morning returned\r\nat 1400 and was guided into the sector of Company F. With all of its\r\nguns blazing, the tank broke through the enemy fortifications, and\r\nCompanies C and F were then able to move in and mop up the enemy. The\r\nother two tanks had gone up the road some 250 yards when they met\r\nantitank fire which completely destroyed one and immobilized the other,\r\ntrapping its crew. As soon as the bridge was made passable, two M8's,\r\na medium tank, and a squad from Company F were sent to rescue the\r\ntrapped crew. While the medium tank and the infantry covered the\r\ndamaged tank, the M8's drew up to it and allowed its crew to escape\r\ninto their open turrets. The detail withdrew, having suffered no\r\ncasualties, and the immobilized tank was then destroyed.\r\n\r\nAt dusk the 2d Battalion, 17th Infantry, and the committed companies\r\nfrom the 1st Battalion pushed some 300 yards beyond the enemy\r\nstrong point and formed a perimeter defense for the night. [461]\r\nCompany B on the far left flank was withdrawn and closed into the\r\nperimeter. Although machine gun and mortar fire came from the left\r\nline of fortifications, there was no major action on the part of the\r\nJapanese. A few of the enemy, attempting to crawl through a trench\r\ninto the position of Company F, became ensnarled in the concertina\r\nwire and were then destroyed by grenades.\r\n\r\nSince the 2d Battalion had borne the brunt of the fighting on 28\r\nOctober and had suffered numerous casualties, the regimental commander\r\ndecided to have the battalion drop back into reserve. Although\r\nthe drive to Dagami was to continue, the north-south line of enemy\r\npillboxes on the left flank of the regiment could not be ignored. At\r\n0800 on 29 October the regimental lines were to be reorganized so\r\nthat the 3d and 1st Battalions, less Company B, would pass through\r\nthe 2d Battalion, which would become the regimental reserve. Company\r\nB with a platoon of M8's would attack the flank and rear of the enemy\r\nin the left line of pillboxes.\r\n\r\nAt 0800, under cover of a heavy artillery concentration from the 49th\r\nField Artillery Battalion, the 1st and 3d Battalions, 17th Infantry,\r\npassed through the 2d Battalion without incident. Company B, reinforced\r\nby the platoon from the Cannon Company, moved out to destroy the\r\nenemy force on the regiment's left flank. The company fought the\r\nJapanese from pillbox to pillbox, catching the enemy on his flanks\r\nand rear by rifle and machine gun fire, together with time-burst fire\r\nfrom the self-propelled howitzers. This completely demoralized the\r\nJapanese, some of whom threw down their arms and tried unsuccessfully\r\nto escape. More than 120 enemy dead were counted in the area. The 1st\r\nBattalion entered the southern part of Dagami without encountering\r\nserious resistance. It then came under artillery fire from the hills\r\nwest of the town.\r\n\r\nThe 3d Battalion proceeded east of the road in a column of companies in\r\nthe order L, K, and I, and met no serious opposition until it reached\r\na cemetery south of Dagami. Overgrown with weeds seven to ten feet\r\nhigh and containing stone crypts built off the ground, the cemetery\r\nwas divided by a path running east to west. As Company L moved into\r\nthe burial ground, Company I swung around the right (east) side to\r\ncome into position for the night. The leading elements of Company\r\nL passed through the cemetery and Company I moved into position\r\nwithout incident, but as the 1st Platoon of Company L, the reserve\r\nplatoon, crossed the path, a headstone tilted back and from the open\r\ngrave four Japanese opened fire with an American Browning automatic\r\nrifle and other small arms. The small arms of the 1st Platoon had no\r\neffect and it became necessary to bring forward a flame thrower to\r\nburn the enemy out. At the same time the platoon received fire from\r\nother open graves, from which the Japanese had removed the bodies. By\r\npunching holes through the stone they used the crypts as individual\r\nfoxholes. The platoon broke into small units and pushed through the\r\ncemetery, destroying the enemy forces wherever they could be located.\r\n\r\nCompany K, which followed Company I, placed two platoons abreast\r\nbehind Company L. As it came through the weeds past the cemetery path a\r\nJapanese officer charged on the right flank with his saber and wounded\r\none man before he could be brought down. Since the platoons were\r\nalso receiving heavy fire from the tombs, the commander of Company\r\nK drew his men back to the path where they reorganized. Preceded by\r\na battery of six flame throwers, the men then marched shoulder to\r\nshoulder through the cemetery and burnt out the enemy. About 1900\r\nthe regiment completed the action and formed its night perimeter.\r\n\r\nDuring the fighting, the regimental operations officer, hearing the\r\nheavy fire and not being able to communicate with the 3d Battalion\r\nheadquarters, called Company K direct to ascertain if the Japanese had\r\nbroken through the American lines. \"Hell no,\" was the reported reply,\r\n\"we're breaking through theirs and fighting for our bivouac.\" [462]\r\nDuring the night small infiltration parties of Japanese tried\r\nunsuccessfully to penetrate the regiment's defenses, and sporadic\r\nartillery fire was received from the hills west of Dagami.\r\n\r\nBy 1040 on 30 October Dagami was securely in American hands, and the\r\n17th Infantry continued to mop up for the rest of the day. The 19th\r\nInfantry Regiment of the 24th Division, X Corps, across the Binahaan\r\nRiver north of Dagami, was reached by an airdrop message from the\r\nartillery spotter plane, and patrols reached the 382d Infantry\r\nof the 96th Division on the east. The mission of the 17th Infantry\r\nRegiment--securing the town of Dagami and effecting junction with the\r\nX Corps and the 96th Division--was completed. The regiment spent the\r\nnext two days in mopping up and patrolling the area around Dagami.\r\n\r\nThe 7th Division had secured the limits of its beachhead line, but\r\nthe southern approaches to the line had not yet been secured. The\r\nroad farther south, running across the island from Abuyog on the east\r\ncoast to Baybay on the west coast, offered a potential route along\r\nwhich the Japanese might pour in reinforcements.\r\n\r\nAt 0530 on 29 October the 2d Battalion, 32d Infantry, left Burauen\r\nfor Abuyog via Dao and the coastal road, Highway 1. Its progress was\r\nimpeded by muddy roads and the previous destruction of the bridge over\r\nthe Bito River. The battalion, less one company, crossed the river\r\nby DUKW's at 0940 and by 1000 was in Abuyog, having encountered no\r\nJapanese. The 7th Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop, acting as an advance\r\nguard for the battalion, pushed west from Abuyog inland four miles\r\non the road toward Baybay.\r\n\r\nOn 30 and 31 October the 2d Battalion, 32d Infantry, remained\r\nat Abuyog, but on the latter day it sent Company G, reinforced,\r\ntoward Baybay on the Abuyog-Baybay road, which corkscrewed through\r\nthe mountains for about twenty-seven miles between the east and west\r\ncoasts. The company encountered no Japanese. On 1 November no forward\r\nprogress was made, but all elements of the 2d Battalion, 32d Infantry,\r\npatrolled. On 2 November Company G moved along the road and closed\r\nin on Baybay at 2200.\r\n\r\nFar to the south the 21st Infantry Regiment, 24th Division, had been\r\nengaged since A Day in extensive patrolling of the Panaon Strait\r\narea. On 31 October the 1st Battalion, 32d Infantry, left the Bayug\r\nairfield for Dulag and at 2200 sailed from Dulag to relieve the\r\n21st Infantry. The battalion arrived at Panaon Island at 0700 on 1\r\nNovember and during the day effected the relief of the 21st Infantry,\r\nwhich then moved north to rejoin the 24th Division. [463]\r\n\r\nThe initial mission of the 7th Infantry Division--to land between the\r\nCalbasag and Daguitan Rivers, advance rapidly inland along the axis\r\nof the Dulag-Burauen road, seize hostile airstrips in its zone of\r\naction, secure the Burauen-Dagami road, and protect the XXIV Corps'\r\nleft (south) flank--had been accomplished.\r\n\r\nSince landing, the 7th Division had killed an estimated 4,211 Japanese\r\nand had taken 19 prisoners. [464] Up to 1000 on 1 November, 32 officers\r\nand 290 enlisted men of the division had been killed; 48 officers,\r\n1 warrant officer, and 777 enlisted men wounded; 15 officers and 223\r\nenlisted men injured; and 21 enlisted men were missing in action. [465]\r\n\r\nBy 2 November, General Hodge's XXIV Corps had finished its assigned\r\nrole for the second phase of General Krueger's plan for the capture of\r\nthe island of Leyte. It had seized the southern part of Leyte Valley\r\nwith its important roads, airfields, and potential base sites. An\r\nelement of the corps had pushed to the west coast of the island,\r\nand was preparing for the move toward the important port of Ormoc as\r\npart of the third phase of the plan. General Makino had been forced\r\nto give up his Dagami headquarters and other positions on the heights\r\noverlooking the town. Far to the north, the X Corps was engaged in\r\nsecuring the northern part of Leyte Valley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nNorthern Leyte Valley: Part One\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the evening of 20 October the Tacloban airfield and Hill 522,\r\noverlooking the town of Palo at the northern entrance to Leyte Valley,\r\nwere in the hands of the X Corps. The night of 20-21 October was\r\nfree from enemy activity in the sector of the 1st Cavalry Division,\r\nand the exhausted troops were able to obtain an unquiet rest during\r\ntheir first night in the Philippines. Having secured the Tacloban\r\nairfield they were in position to march on Tacloban, the capital of\r\nLeyte, the following morning. Tacloban is situated on a peninsula at\r\nthe head of San Pedro Bay. A string of low hills, stretching from\r\nAnibong Point along the base of the peninsula to the southeast,\r\ncommands the approaches to the town. [466] Throughout the night the\r\n61st Field Artillery Battalion delivered harassing fires on the hills\r\nsouth of the town. [467] (Map 9)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSan Juanico Strait\r\n\r\nDrive Toward Caibaan\r\n\r\nGeneral Krueger wished to push rapidly through Leyte Valley and\r\nsecure its important roads and airfields before the Japanese could\r\nregroup and offer a firm line of resistance. In the north, securing San\r\nJuanico Strait would prevent any of the enemy from crossing over from\r\nSamar. Control of the road that led through the interior of northern\r\nLeyte Valley would give the possessor a firm hold on the northern\r\npart of the valley. With a successful two-pronged attack--elements\r\nof the 1st Cavalry Division driving north along San Juanico Strait\r\nand units of the 24th Infantry Division pushing along Highway 2--the\r\nX Corps would arrive at Carigara Bay. At that point the corps would\r\nbe in position to contest any Japanese amphibious movement through\r\nCarigara Bay, and at the same time elements of the corps could drive\r\nsouth through Ormoc Valley and secure the important port of Ormoc.\r\n\r\nPreceded by a naval and air bombardment and a preparation by the\r\n61st Field Artillery Battalion, [468] the 1st Cavalry Division at\r\n0800 on 21 October resumed the assault against the Japanese. [469]\r\nThe division was to capture Tacloban and then secure control over San\r\nJuanico Strait. [470] The 7th Cavalry, 2d Brigade, had been assigned\r\nthe mission of seizing Tacloban, [471] which was defended by elements\r\nof the Japanese 33d Infantry Regiment. [472]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of 21 October the 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry, joined\r\nthe regiment's 2d Squadron in a drive on Tacloban. At 0800 the\r\n7th Cavalry moved with squadrons abreast, the 1st Squadron on the\r\nright and the 2d Squadron on the left, astride the highway leading\r\nto Tacloban. Although the squadrons found the terrain extremely\r\nswampy and movement difficult, by 1400 the 1st Squadron was on the\r\noutskirts of the town and the 2d was halted at the foot of a hill\r\noverlooking Tacloban. The Japanese had dug into the hills overlooking\r\nthe capital. The division artillery then shelled the hill and the\r\nhigh ground to the north. [473] At 1500 the fire was lifted and the\r\nforward movement proceeded.\r\n\r\nThe men of the 1st Squadron entered Tacloban to conduct a\r\nhouse-to-house search for concealed Japanese. They received a\r\ntumultuous welcome from the Filipinos who lined the sides of the\r\nnarrow streets, waving American flags and urging gifts of eggs and\r\nfruit upon the troopers. [474] They were also welcomed by the governor\r\nof the province. The 2d Squadron, on the other hand, was held up by an\r\nestimated 200 Japanese who were entrenched in pillboxes and foxholes\r\nand behind the dense vegetation that covered the hilly area. As heavy\r\nfire from the enemy pinned down the troops, Col. Walter H. Finnegan,\r\nthe regiment's commanding officer, sent the Antitank Platoon and\r\nelements of the Regimental Weapons Troop in support of the 2d Squadron,\r\nwhere that unit faced the southern end of the hill mass. [475]\r\n\r\nThe Weapons Troop was ordered to lay aside its automatic weapons and\r\nassault the hill with rifles, but it was pinned down by intense fire\r\nfrom an enemy bunker to the immediate front. Pfc. Kenneth W. Grove,\r\nan ammunition carrier, volunteered to clear the Japanese from the\r\nposition. He worked his way through the underbrush to the flank of\r\nthe bunker, then charged in the open against its front and killed\r\nthe gun crew. [476] The advance then continued.\r\n\r\nThe movements of the Weapons Troop and the Antitank Platoon were\r\nsuccessful, and by 1800 the southern half of the hill and the town\r\nof Tacloban were in American hands. Shortly after the seizure of\r\nthe capital, General Mudge, the division commander, inspected the\r\ntown from a medium tank. At one point, where the Japanese had turned\r\nover a truck to form a roadblock, the general personally received the\r\nsurrender of forty Formosan laborers. [477] The regimental command post\r\nwas established in the building that had housed the Leyte Intermediate\r\nSchool for Girls.\r\n\r\nThe following day, after an intensive mortar, artillery, and air\r\nbombardment on a hill southwest of Tacloban, the 2d Squadron of the\r\n7th Cavalry moved out against the hill at 0820. Although the terrain\r\nwas rugged, the position was overrun by 1100. The 1st Squadron spent\r\nthe day mopping up the town in search of the enemy. At 1108 General\r\nMudge released the 8th Cavalry, commanded by Colonel Bradley, to 2d\r\nBrigade control.\r\n\r\nBy the end of 22 October the capital of Leyte and its hill defenses\r\nwere securely in American hands. The 7th Cavalry was one day ahead\r\nof schedule, a fact partly explained by the unexpectedly light\r\nresistance of the Japanese and partly by the vigor of the 7th Cavalry's\r\nadvance. [478]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of 22 October the 8th Cavalry made a \"victory\" march\r\nthrough liberated Tacloban and went into perimeter to the west of\r\nthe 7th Cavalry on the hills overlooking the town. Troop C went to\r\nAnibong Point in order to guard the brigade flank from a suspected\r\nJapanese barge landing through San Juanico Strait.\r\n\r\nShortly after the command post was opened at 1830, the 8th Cavalry\r\nreceived orders for the 1st Squadron to depart at 0700 on the\r\nfollowing day. It was to pass through the 7th Cavalry and secure the\r\nbridge crossing the Diit River so as to protect the 2d Squadron,\r\n8th Cavalry. The latter was directed to move northwest across the\r\nmountains, seize Santa Cruz, which was on Carigara Bay about sixteen\r\nmiles northwest of Tacloban, and locate the remnants of the Japanese\r\nwho had opposed the 7th Cavalry in its advance through the city.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Squadron, 8th Cavalry, passed through the 7th Cavalry at 0900\r\non the morning of 23 October. By nightfall the squadron had crossed\r\nand secured the Diit River bridge and routed small groups of the\r\nenemy. The 2d Squadron experienced difficulty in securing Filipino\r\ncarriers for the trip up the Diit River and across the unmapped and\r\nunknown mountains to Santa Cruz. It resolved the situation by driving\r\na truck through the streets and seizing every able-bodied Filipino\r\nin sight. These \"volunteers\" were sufficient to get the squadron to\r\nits night bivouac on the Diit River. The \"indignant carriers [then]\r\ndissolved into the jungle.\" [479] The 2d Squadron established its\r\nperimeter near the village of Diit.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the 1st Brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division had been ordered\r\nto move west on 21 October. This maneuver was designed to protect\r\nthe southern flank of the 2d Brigade and to prevent the Japanese\r\nfrom reinforcing their troops in Tacloban. The 1st Brigade moved\r\nout at 0800 toward Caibaan, the 12th Cavalry on the right and the\r\n5th Cavalry on the left. [480] Troop B of the 12th Cavalry advanced\r\ntoward the barrio of Utap, and though it ran into enemy opposition it\r\nwas able to secure the town after being reinforced by the regimental\r\nand brigade reconnaissance platoons. Swampy ground made the going\r\nvery difficult. The troops captured a large Japanese supply dump\r\nwhich contained quantities of foodstuffs, vehicles, and equipment,\r\nand valuable documents. [481]\r\n\r\nThe 1st and 2d Squadrons of the 5th Cavalry advanced abreast toward\r\nCaibaan and the high ground beyond the town. They encountered only\r\nsporadic rifle fire in Caibaan but at the foot of one of the hills they\r\nmet determined opposition from about half a company of Japanese. After\r\nan exchange of fire, the Japanese signified they wished to surrender\r\nby waving a white flag. The heavy machine guns were brought into\r\nposition and the American soldiers signalled for the Japanese to\r\ndisrobe in order to forestall their using concealed grenades or other\r\nweapons. The Japanese opened fire and wounded five men. The automatic\r\nweapons then returned the fire, killing thirteen of the enemy. The\r\nremaining Japanese withdrew over the hill, and contact was lost.\r\n\r\nThere was no enemy activity in the 5th Cavalry's sector during\r\nthe night of 21-22 October, and at 0645 the advance elements of\r\nthe 1st Squadron began to move up the steep east slope of a hill\r\nwest of Caibaan. The squadron continued its advance, and at 1200\r\nengaged in a short skirmish between the hill and Caibaan, killing ten\r\nJapanese. The difficult terrain, rather than the Japanese, slowed the\r\nadvance. Hampered by tall cogon grass, which cut off every breeze,\r\nthe troops struggled up steep slopes and sharp ridges. Exposed to\r\nthe hot sun and burdened with equipment and ammunition, they were\r\nsoon exhausted. At 1447 the 5th Cavalry received orders to halt all\r\nforward movement until further notice. The 1st Squadron was in bad\r\ncondition physically, since it had been steadily on the move for a\r\nday and a half and had consumed all its rations and water. At the\r\nend of the day, 22 October, the squadron was still at the base of\r\nthe hill, but the rest of the regiment had reached Caibaan. [482] On\r\nthe following day elements of the 5th Cavalry were sent to Tacloban\r\nto act as a guard of honor for General MacArthur. The other units\r\nremained in position. [483]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRestoration of Civil Government\r\n\r\nThe guard of honor, consisting of 1st Lt. John Gregory and thirty\r\nenlisted men of the 5th Cavalry, arrived at Tacloban later on 23\r\nOctober. President Osmeña of the Philippine Commonwealth was also\r\npresent, having come ashore for the occasion. [484] A simple but\r\nimpressive ceremony was held in front of the municipal building\r\nof Tacloban, though the interior of the edifice was a shambles of\r\nbroken furniture and scattered papers. A guard of honor of \"dirty and\r\ntired but efficient-looking soldiers\" [485] was drawn up in front\r\nof the government building. General MacArthur broadcast an address\r\nannouncing the establishment of the Philippine Civil Government with\r\nPresident Osmeña as its head. Lt. Gen. Richard K. Sutherland then read\r\nthe official proclamation. President Osmeña spoke appreciatively of\r\nAmerican support and of the determination of the Filipinos to expel\r\nthe enemy. \"To the Color\" was sounded on the bugle, and the national\r\nflags of the United States and the Philippines were simultaneously\r\nhoisted on the sides of the building. Colonel Kangleon of the guerrilla\r\nforces was then decorated with the Distinguished Service Cross.\r\n\r\nFew Filipinos except representatives of the local government were\r\npresent for the ceremony. Apparently the inhabitants had not heard of\r\nit, or did not know that they were permitted to attend. Information\r\nquickly spread, however, that the civil government had assumed control,\r\nand as General MacArthur and his party left town the civil population\r\ncheered them. [486]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDrive up the Strait\r\n\r\nThough the 1st Cavalry Division had secured Tacloban and the region\r\nsurrounding it, there remained the important task of seizing San\r\nJuanico Strait to prevent the Japanese from bringing in reinforcements\r\nfrom Samar. (See Map 2.) [487] San Juanico Strait, connecting the\r\nLeyte Gulf with Samar Sea, forms a narrow passage between Leyte and\r\nSamar Islands. Highway 1 ends on its western shore, some fourteen miles\r\nnorth of Tacloban at Guintiguian, a small barrio (not shown on the map)\r\ntwo miles north of San Isidro. A ferry between Guintiguian and La Paz,\r\njust across the strait on Samar, links the road networks of the two\r\nislands. The 2d Brigade's mission was to seize Guintiguian on Leyte;\r\nLa Paz on Samar (including the establishment of a bridgehead on the\r\nnorth bank of the Silaga River, three miles northeast of La Paz); and\r\nBabatngon on the north coast of Leyte. By shore-to-shore operations\r\nit was also to seize Basey on the island of Samar and the area north\r\nand west of it. [488]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          GENERAL HEADQUARTERS\r\n                         SOUTHWEST PACIFIC AREA\r\n                    OFFICE OF THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PROCLAMATION\r\n\r\n\r\n    TO THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I have returned. By the grace of Almighty God our forces stand\r\n    again on Philippine soil--soil consecrated in the blood of our\r\n    two peoples. We have come, dedicated and committed, to the task of\r\n    destroying every vestige of enemy control over your daily lives,\r\n    and of restoring, upon a foundation of indestructible strength,\r\n    the liberties of your people.\r\n\r\n    At my side is your President, Sergio Osmeña, worthy successor of\r\n    that great patriot, Manuel Quezon, with members of his cabinet. The\r\n    seat of your government is now therefore firmly re-established\r\n    on Philippine soil.\r\n\r\n    The hour of your redemption is here. Your patriots have\r\n    demonstrated an unswerving and resolute devotion to the principles\r\n    of freedom that challenges the best that is written on the pages\r\n    of human history. I now call upon your supreme effort that the\r\n    enemy may know from the temper of an aroused and outraged people\r\n    within that he has a force there to contend with no less violent\r\n    than is the force committed from without.\r\n\r\n    Rally to me. Let the indomitable spirit of Bataan and Corregidor\r\n    lead on. As the lines of battle roll forward to bring you within\r\n    the zone of operations, rise and strike. Strike at every favorable\r\n    opportunity. For your homes and hearths, strike! For future\r\n    generations of your sons and daughters, strike! In the name of\r\n    your sacred dead, strike! Let no heart be faint. Let every arm\r\n    be steeled. The guidance of divine God points the way. Follow in\r\n    His Name to the Holy Grail of righteous victory!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                DOUGLAS MacARTHUR.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Hoffman had been warned that his 2d Brigade would be assigned\r\nthe mission of securing San Juanico Strait and possibly landing\r\non Samar; he therefore directed an overwater reconnaissance of the\r\nsector. Consequently, on 23 October the staff officers of the 8th\r\nCavalry and of the 1st Squadron of the regiment boarded an LCI at the\r\nTacloban dock. The landing craft made the trip through San Juanico\r\nStrait to the barrio of Babatngon on Janabatas Channel without\r\nincident. On the return trip, the officers observed some Japanese\r\npositions which overlooked the ferry crossing at the Guintiguian\r\nlanding on Leyte. The party made a brief reconnaissance of the\r\nGuintiguian side of the ferry landing and of La Paz on the Samar\r\nside. There was no enemy contact. [489]\r\n\r\nAs a consequence General Hoffman, in issuing his orders for the next\r\nday, assigned the following missions: the 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry,\r\nunder Maj. Leonard E. Smith would embark at 0630 on 24 October,\r\nand move overwater to seize the town of Babatngon. This operation\r\nwould seal off the western entrance into San Juanico Strait. Troop C,\r\nreinforced, of the 1st Squadron, 8th Cavalry, under Maj. F. Raymond\r\nKing, was also to embark at 0630 from Tacloban and move north to\r\nseize the ferry crossing between Guintiguian and La Paz. At the same\r\ntime the rest of the 1st Squadron, 8th Cavalry, under Lt. Col. Mayers\r\nShore, would drive north along the highway and effect a juncture with\r\nC Troop at Guintiguian. [490]\r\n\r\nThe 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry, sailed for Babatngon at 1030 on 24\r\nOctober. The trip was uneventful, and at 1330 the squadron arrived\r\nat Babatngon, sent out security patrols, and established a perimeter\r\ndefense. On 25 October the Japanese launched an air attack, hitting\r\nan LCI in the Babatngon harbor. Eight men were killed and seventeen\r\nwounded, all of them Navy personnel. [491] For the next few days\r\nthe 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry, made a series of overwater movements\r\nthrough Carigara Bay and exploited the lack of any strong Japanese\r\nresistance along the northeast coast of the Leyte Valley. [492]\r\n\r\nReinforced Troop C of the 1st Squadron, 8th Cavalry, was ready to\r\nsail by 0630 on 24 October but was delayed by a Japanese air attack\r\non the shipping in Tacloban harbor and San Pedro Bay, made by about\r\nfifty medium bombers and Army fighters. Before they could reach the\r\nbeachhead area, many of the Japanese planes were shot down by Navy\r\ncombat air patrol fliers, who also beat off another wave of about\r\nthirty more planes. Two of the American planes crash-landed on the\r\nTacloban airfield, while a third landed in the water. [493] There\r\nwas minor damage to American shipping.\r\n\r\nOne of the Japanese planes crashed less than 200 yards from elements\r\nof Troop C but the force got under way. The troopers, after running\r\ndown and killing five Japanese in a canoe, arrived at La Paz, Samar,\r\ntheir destination, without further excitement and established a\r\nroadblock on the road leading to Basey.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Squadron of the 8th Cavalry, which was to travel overland\r\nby Highway 1 to make junction with Troop C at the ferry crossing,\r\nbroke camp at 0700 on the morning of the 24th. The squadron was\r\naccompanied by a platoon of light tanks and weapons carriers with\r\nrations and ammunition. Since the passage was through enemy-held\r\nterritory and over unfamiliar terrain, and since the strength of the\r\nJapanese forces was unknown, it was estimated that it would take the\r\nsquadron a minimum of two days to cover the sixteen and a quarter\r\nmiles between the two forces. The commanding officer of the squadron,\r\nhowever, by utilizing stream-crossing expedients to the utmost in\r\nsnaking tanks and vehicles across the many intersecting streams and\r\nby driving the troops, was able to complete the difficult march to\r\nGuintiguian and go into perimeter with all his men except a rear guard\r\nat 2130 on the same day. At the end of 24 October, the 8th Cavalry,\r\nless the 2d Squadron, was in a position from which it could defend\r\nits beachhead on Samar. [494]\r\n\r\nAt 2300 an estimated hundred Japanese from the 2d Battalion, 9th\r\nInfantry Regiment, attacked the roadblock which had been established\r\non the road leading to Basey. The Japanese opened up with machine\r\ngun fire and tossed several grenades against the position. The\r\ndefenders repelled the attack with machine gun and mortar fire,\r\nbut for the remainder of the night \"confusion reigned supreme and\r\nthe odds and ends were not rounded up until the next morning.\" [495]\r\nDuring the next three days the 8th Cavalry consolidated its position\r\nand extended its perimeter to include a bridgehead on the Silaga River.\r\n\r\nBy the end of 27 October the 1st Cavalry Division had seized\r\nTacloban and gained control of San Juanico Strait. Because of supply\r\ndifficulties the 2d Brigade on 25 October had ordered the 2d Squadron,\r\n8th Cavalry, to discontinue its movement toward Santa Cruz, to remain\r\nin bivouac along the upper reaches of the Diit River and patrol that\r\narea. At this time the casualties of the 1st Cavalry Division amounted\r\nto 4 officers and 36 enlisted men killed, 14 officers and 185 enlisted\r\nmen wounded, and 8 enlisted men missing in action. [496] During the\r\nsame period, the division reported it had killed 739 of the enemy\r\nand had taken prisoner 7 Japanese, 1 Formosan, and 1 Chinese. [497]\r\n\r\nThe opposition had been light--much lighter than had been\r\nexpected. Elements of the division had therefore been sent south to\r\nreinforce the 24th Division, which had borne the brunt of the Japanese\r\nopposition in the X Corps sector in its drive through northern Leyte\r\nValley toward Carigara Bay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeyte Valley Entrance\r\n\r\nDefense at Pawing\r\n\r\nAt the end of 20 October the 24th Division had established a firm\r\nbeachhead near Palo, averaging a mile in depth, and had secured Hill\r\n522 which overlooked Palo. [498] (Map 10) The 24th Division was to\r\nseize Palo and drive astride the road that ran northwest through\r\nthe Leyte Valley to Carigara. The 34th Infantry, in the vicinity of\r\nPawing, had its 2d Battalion, commanded by Lt. Col. James F. Pearsall,\r\nJr., 100 yards west of Highway 1, with the northern elements of the\r\nbattalion in contact with the 5th Cavalry of the 1st Cavalry Division\r\non the right. The 3d Battalion, 34th Infantry, was just short of\r\nthe highway. The leading elements of the 19th Infantry were on Hill\r\n522. [499]\r\n\r\nAt 0100 on 21 October three companies of Japanese, [500] part of\r\nthe 33d Infantry Regiment, [501] under cover of darkness and aided\r\nby heavy machine gun and mortar fire, struck from the south along\r\nHighway 1. The leading elements made a double envelopment of the\r\nAmerican flanks while the main force came down the road and attacked\r\nthe perimeter of the 2d Platoon of Company G. By 0200 the enemy,\r\nstill employing machine gun and mortar fire, had pushed to within a\r\nfew yards of the American positions and had killed or wounded everyone\r\nbut Pvt. Harold H. Moon, Jr., in the first two positions.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese then centered their fire upon Private Moon, who, although\r\nwounded by this fire, replied with his submachine gun. An enemy officer\r\nattempted to throw grenades at Moon's position and was killed. The\r\nJapanese then brought up a light machine gun to within twenty yards\r\nof his position. Moon called back the range correction to friendly\r\nmortars which knocked out the machine gun. For over four hours he\r\nheld back the enemy. At dawn an entire platoon with fixed bayonets\r\ncharged toward him. From a sitting position he fired into the Japanese,\r\nkilled eighteen, and repulsed the attack. He then stood up and threw\r\na grenade at a machine gun that had opened up on his right. He was\r\nhit and instantly killed. [502] The Japanese then resumed their\r\nattack, but the remnants of Moon's platoon fixed bayonets, charged,\r\nand succeeded in breaking through the enemy line.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the enemy hit the perimeter of Company L. For\r\nseveral hours the Japanese felt out the company positions, and then,\r\ncovered by three machine guns, they charged in platoon strength on\r\nthe east side of the company's perimeter. The company, supported\r\nby mortar fire, retaliated and assaulted the Japanese in front of\r\nthe perimeter. Attempted movements around both the enemy flanks\r\nfailed. A frontal assault, protected by fire from both flanks, was\r\nthen successfully made by the company, and the Japanese force was\r\nrouted. There were 105 enemy dead in the immediate area of the company.\r\n\r\nBy this time it was dawn, and Pearsall's men began extensive\r\ncountermeasures. Concentrated mortar fire was laid down, and, since\r\nJapanese artillery was shelling the American positions, artillery\r\nand air strikes were requested. At 0900 Battery A of the 63d Field\r\nArtillery Battalion fired 150 rounds on the Japanese. [503]\r\n\r\nAt a point 1,500 yards south of Pawing naval flyers from the Seventh\r\nFleet strafed the enemy and, in co-operation with the artillery fire,\r\nsuccessfully broke the back of the offensive. The enemy scattered\r\ninto the rice paddies. Members of the 2d Battalion were then able\r\nto go down the road and mop up. More than 600 Japanese were killed\r\nduring the engagement. [504] Company G, which had borne the brunt of\r\nthe attack, lost fourteen men killed and had twelve wounded.\r\n\r\nThe battalion had scarcely finished breakfast when at 1000 it was given\r\nthe mission of seizing a hill mass immediately west of its position\r\nat Pawing. After artillery and naval gunfire had been placed upon the\r\nhill for fifteen minutes, [505] E Company was to take the northern\r\nknoll of the hill mass and F Company to take the southern knoll. It\r\nwas not until 1400, however, that the attack jumped off. Company E\r\nmet no opposition, and within twenty-five minutes was able to occupy\r\nits objective.\r\n\r\nCompany F, commanded by Capt. Paul Austin, had more difficulty. Its\r\nobjective was a steep hill, heavily covered with cogon grass ten to\r\ntwelve feet high, which limited visibility to a few feet. A trail\r\nran west from a small clump of trees to the top of the hill, and\r\nthen south along the crest of the ridge where the grass was only six\r\ninches high. The company proceeded west in a column of platoons and at\r\n1430 reached the foot of the hill. At the western edge of the group\r\nof trees, the 1st and 3d Platoons turned left and advanced directly\r\ntoward the highest point of the hill. The 2d Platoon, with machine\r\nguns, continued up the path.\r\n\r\nAs the 2d Squad of the 1st Platoon reached the crest and as the\r\n1st Squad had nearly done so, an estimated 200 Japanese from the\r\n33d Infantry Regiment opened fire upon the troops with rifles\r\nand two machine guns that were emplaced upon a knoll overlooking\r\nthe trail. Enemy riflemen also rolled grenades down upon the 1st\r\nSquad. These actions pinned down both of the squads.\r\n\r\nProtected by the machine gun fire, other enemy riflemen worked north\r\nalong the reverse slope of the ridge and began to throw grenades down\r\nupon the 2d Platoon. The Japanese possessed a seemingly inexhaustible\r\nsupply of grenades, which they rolled down upon the Americans with\r\ntelling effect. Company F was unable to advance. By 1500 the 1st and\r\n2d Squads of the 1st Platoon were forced off the forward slope. The\r\n2d Platoon also had been unable to go ahead, and the company had\r\nsuffered fourteen casualties. Captain Austin ordered his company to\r\ndisengage for reorganization. Since the American mortars could not\r\nfire directly upon the Japanese for fear of hitting friendly troops,\r\nthey were forced to fire over the enemy and gradually shorten the range\r\nas the American troops disengaged. Consequently the fire at first was\r\nnot too effective. By 1600 the reorganization was complete, but Colonel\r\nPearsall decided to delay the attack until artillery support could be\r\nobtained. Company F formed its night perimeter 500 yards from Pawing.\r\n\r\nThe following morning arrangements were made for an air strike by Navy\r\nflyers on the positions of the 33d Infantry Regiment on the hill. It\r\nwas not until afternoon, however, that the strike could be effected. At\r\n1345 the 63d Field Artillery Battalion marked with smoke the right\r\nand left limits for the air strike. [506] At 1410 naval dive bombers\r\nbombed and strafed the hill for ten minutes with very good results,\r\nand the Japanese power to resist was broken. [507] Captain Austin's\r\nCompany F, accompanied by Colonel Newman, the regimental commander,\r\nthen moved out. Supported by artillery fire, Company F captured the\r\nentire ridge by 1515 without a single casualty. The Pawing area was\r\nnow securely in American hands. Farther south the 19th Infantry was\r\nengaged in fulfilling its mission of capturing the town of Palo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCapture of Palo\r\n\r\nAt the end of the first day's fighting, C Company of the 19th Infantry\r\nhad just secured the top of Hill 522 and Company B at dusk had been\r\npinned down at the southern crest. The following morning artillery fire\r\neffectively knocked out some enemy pillboxes on the north crest. Both\r\ncompanies then simultaneously launched an attack down the far slope\r\nof the hill. In the sharp fight that followed fifty Japanese from the\r\n33d Infantry Regiment were killed and the hill was secured. [508] It\r\nwas not until late in the day, however, that supplies could be brought\r\nto the troops and the wounded be evacuated. The 1st Battalion spent\r\nthe next few days mopping up the area and sealing off the tunnels\r\nwith grenades.\r\n\r\nOn the beach the 3d Battalion, 19th Infantry, on the morning of\r\n21 October waited for naval gunfire to knock out positions that\r\nblocked the beach road to Palo. These defenses consisted of mutually\r\nsupporting well-constructed pillboxes reinforced with logs and earth,\r\nwith intercommunicating trenches and foxholes. They were designed to\r\nbe used in resisting attacks from the beach and from the north. After\r\nan all-night mortar concentration, naval gunfire was directed against\r\nthe positions, and at 1400 the 3d Battalion attacked. When within 200\r\nyards of a road bend, Company I and elements of the Antitank Company,\r\nleading the main assault, met strong resistance, which forced the\r\ncompany to dig in. The other companies occupied the same positions\r\nthey had held the previous day. [509] During the night Company C of\r\nthe 85th Chemical Battalion, expending 500 rounds of ammunition,\r\nlaid intermittent fire from the 4.2-inch mortars on the Japanese\r\npositions. [510]\r\n\r\nAt 0900 on 22 October the 3d Battalion, with Company I in the lead,\r\nattacked with the 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry, which had been released\r\nfrom division reserve, on its left flank. This co-ordinated advance\r\npushed past the defensive positions of the 33d Infantry Regiment,\r\nmany of which had been abandoned. The positions of the 3d Battalion,\r\n19th Infantry, were taken over by the 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry. The\r\nlatter battalion patrolled the road and eliminated scattered Japanese\r\npockets of resistance south to the Palo River.\r\n\r\nThe 2d Battalion, 19th Infantry, was to secure Palo, which is situated\r\nabout one mile inland on the south side of the Palo River. The town\r\nis an important road junction, the meeting point of the Leyte Valley\r\nand east coast road systems. The coastal road, Highway 1, which\r\ngoes through Palo, crosses a steel bridge over the Palo River on the\r\nedge of the town. Highway 2, a one-lane all-weather road for most of\r\nits length, extends west to Barugo and Carigara. [511] Just outside\r\nPalo are two hills, one on each side of the highway, which guard the\r\nentrance into the interior. The Americans termed them Hills B and\r\nC. Elements of the 33d Infantry Regiment were guarding Palo. [512]\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning of 21 October, the 2d Battalion, 19th Infantry,\r\nmoved west through enemy machine gun and rifle fire and bypassed the\r\nenemy defensive position that had held it up the previous day. At\r\n1155 the battalion reached the junction of the beach road and Highway\r\n1. During the movement two men were killed and two wounded. At the road\r\njunction, the battalion dispersed with machine gun fire a column of\r\nabout thirty-five Japanese moving south on Highway 1. Artillery fire\r\nwas then laid on a grove of trees, west of the road, to which the\r\nenemy had fled. As the battalion proceeded south along the highway\r\nbetween the road junction and the bridge, it came under artillery\r\nfire from an undetermined source. The tempo of the march into Palo\r\nwas accelerated--\"the troops wanted to move as rapidly as possible\r\nfrom that vicinity. They double timed across the bridge.\" [513]\r\nAt 1500 they entered Palo without further opposition. [514]\r\n\r\nThe residents of the town were crowded into the church. As the\r\nAmericans entered, the church bell rang and the Filipinos came out and\r\ngreeted the troops. After the first exuberant welcome had subsided,\r\nthe soldiers ordered the civilians back into the church until they\r\ncould secure the town. In the house-to-house search, the troops found\r\nsome booby traps made from coconuts [515] and encountered Japanese\r\nentrenched under and between houses in the western sector of the\r\ntown. Although the battalion had expected to outpost the entire town,\r\nthe menace of the Japanese appeared so threatening that a night\r\nperimeter was established around the town square.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefense of Palo\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of the night there was continuous rifle fire from\r\nindividual Japanese. The 13th Field Artillery Battalion had arrived and\r\nbegan to fire on the roads leading into the town, expending some 300\r\nrounds of ammunition. At midnight some Japanese ammunition stored in a\r\nhouse exploded, and the ensuing fire lasted for three hours. At 0400\r\non 22 October elements of the 33d Infantry Regiment counterattacked\r\nalong Highway 2 [516] but were repulsed by fire from the outposts. The\r\nenemy then struck at the juncture of the left flank of Company F and\r\nthe right flank of Company G. The 81-mm. mortars of the 2d Battalion\r\nfired on this point, expending all their ammunition. In the meantime\r\nBattery B of the 13th Field Artillery Battalion and elements of the\r\n63d Field Artillery Battalion moved up to within a hundred yards of\r\nthe front outposts and fired. The enemy stubbornly continued to fight,\r\nthrowing \"everything he had into the attack.\" [517] At the same time\r\nnearly a platoon of the enemy came out at the curve of the beach road\r\nand started toward the bridge on Highway 1 at Palo, but these troops\r\nwere dispersed by light machine gun fire. Artillery fire forced the\r\nJapanese to withdraw, and they were thrown back on all fronts. [518]\r\nThough the battalion had lost 16 men killed and 44 wounded, it had\r\nkilled 91 Japanese. After the engagement, the battalion requested\r\nadditional ammunition, supplies, and equipment, and transportation\r\nfor the wounded. [519] The requests were complied with, though not\r\nwithout danger since the Japanese had mined the road.\r\n\r\nAt 1330 the regimental headquarters of the 19th Infantry moved into\r\nPalo. The regiment's 3d Battalion relieved the 2d Battalion at the\r\nsame time, thus enabling the latter to attack Hill B at 1425. [520]\r\nThe 3d Battalion spent the rest of the day and the following day\r\nmopping up in Palo and sending probing patrols southward in order to\r\nmake contact with the XXIV Corps. [521] A patrol in Palo killed seven\r\nJapanese dressed in civilian clothing, one of whom, a lieutenant,\r\nhad his insignia pinned inside his clothes. [522]\r\n\r\nOn the night of 23 October Col. Tatsunosuke Suzuki, the commanding\r\nofficer of the 33d Infantry Regiment, led a raiding detachment,\r\narmed with rifles, sabres, grenades, and mines, into Palo from the\r\nsouthwest. [523] Using Filipino civilians in front of them, the men\r\nof the detachment tricked the guards at the outpost into believing\r\nthat they were guerrillas. The Japanese were thus able to capture two\r\nmachine guns and a 37-mm. gun. They penetrated to the town square and\r\ncharged, throwing explosives into houses, trucks, and a tank, and broke\r\ninto an evacuation hospital where they killed some wounded. They then\r\nmoved toward the bridge and mounted the captured machine guns on it,\r\n[524] firing until their ammunition was exhausted and then abandoning\r\nthe guns. The American guards on the other side of the bridge, however,\r\nwere able to fire upon the bridge and its approaches so effectively\r\nthat they killed fifty Japanese, according to a count made the next\r\nmorning. The raid was completely broken up, and sixty Japanese,\r\nincluding Colonel Suzuki, were killed. The American casualties were\r\nfourteen killed and twenty wounded.\r\n\r\nThe 3d Battalion, 19th Infantry, had sent Company K to reconnoiter to\r\nthe south and if possible make contact with the XXIV Corps. On the\r\nmorning of the 24th the company entered San Joaquin to the south of\r\nPalo. By 1600 the town had been secured and the company was prepared\r\nto defend it. Engineers began to repair the damaged bridge so that\r\narmored units could proceed southward along Highway 1. On the morning\r\nof 25 October Company K advanced south from San Joaquin and by 1200 had\r\nsecured positions on the north bank of the Binahaan River, from which\r\npatrols were sent into Tanauan. At 1430 the patrols met a motorized\r\nunit of the 96th Division, establishing contact for the first time\r\nbetween the X and XXIV Corps. The rest of the battalion moved out\r\nof Palo the same morning and was able to advance rapidly with little\r\nopposition and set up a perimeter at Castilla, 8,000 yards southwest\r\nof Palo.\r\n\r\nThus the northern and southern approaches to Palo and the beachhead\r\narea east of the town had now been secured. But on the western edge\r\nof Palo were the two hills athwart Highway 2 and blocking passage into\r\nLeyte Valley. Hill B on the southern side of the highway and Hill C on\r\nthe northern side would have to be secured before the Americans could\r\nadvance. Preliminary reconnaissance had revealed that these hills were\r\nstrongly held, and since the 24th Division, contrary to expectations,\r\nhad encountered considerably stronger opposition than the 1st Cavalry\r\nDivision, General Sibert decided to detach the 1st Brigade from the 1st\r\nCavalry Division and place it under X Corps control. The 2d Squadron\r\nof the 5th Cavalry remained in position on the high ground west of\r\nTacloban, while the regiment's 1st Squadron moved into position in\r\nPawing, to relieve the 2d Battalion, 34th Infantry. The 12th Cavalry\r\nassembled in the vicinity of Marasbaras in X Corps reserve. [525]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCapture of Hill C\r\n\r\nAt 0800 on 23 October the 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry, commanded by\r\nMaj. Edwin N. Edris, and the 1st Platoon, 603d Tank Company, assembled\r\n500 yards north of Hill 522 preparatory to launching an attack on\r\nHill C. [526] It was reported that 300 Japanese were in a strong\r\ndefensive position between Hills C and 331, the latter located west\r\nof Pawing. Consequently, an air strike was called for and delivered\r\non the area, after which the battalion started for Hill C. The first\r\nobstacle encountered was a small ridge known as Hill Nan, and just\r\nbeyond this ridge was another hill mass known as Hill Mike. Company\r\nB advanced up Hill Nan in a skirmish line. When the company neared\r\nthe crest of the ridge, a machine gun 200 yards to its front opened\r\nup, and at the same time the Japanese from dug-in positions on the\r\nreverse slope began to throw grenades over the crest. The company\r\nwas halted. Three times during the afternoon it reached the crest,\r\nonly to be driven back by enemy fire. Several counterattacks were\r\nrepulsed, but the machine gun was not silenced.\r\n\r\nAt 1800 the company received orders to disengage so that artillery\r\nfire might be laid upon the enemy positions. The Japanese immediately\r\ncounterattacked. An American lieutenant and a sergeant of the company\r\nrushed to the crest with grenades which they threw upon the advancing\r\nJapanese. This action enabled the company to disengage and return to\r\nthe assembly area with only a few casualties.\r\n\r\nDuring the night artillery and 4.2-inch mortar fires were placed on\r\nthe ridge. As a result, on the following day, 24 October, the 1st\r\nBattalion secured it without meeting any resistance. With this ridge\r\nin American hands, the 3d Battalion was able to pass through the 1st\r\nBattalion and secure without opposition Hill Mike, the last remaining\r\nobstacle before Hill C. During the night artillery pounded Hill C.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of 25 October the 3d Battalion, 34th Infantry, moved\r\nout to attack Hill C, with Companies I and K abreast. [527] Although\r\nthe troops found the hill difficult to climb, elements of Company\r\nK reached its crest without opposition. The enemy started his usual\r\ntactics of throwing grenades over the crest of the hill at Company I\r\nas it neared the top. Since the company had suffered many casualties,\r\na platoon from Company K was sent to reinforce Company I. Finally, at\r\n1700, the company took the crest of the hill and dug in for the night.\r\n\r\nThe 2d Battalion, 34th Infantry, which had been relieved by the 1st\r\nSquadron, 5th Cavalry, moved out of Pawing at 0700 on 24 October. At\r\n1030 it received orders to seize a small hill southeast of Hill\r\nC. With Company E in the lead, the battalion proceeded in single file\r\nup the hill, which was covered with cogon grass. As it had hitherto\r\nbeen the practice of the Japanese to withhold their main fire until\r\nthe Americans neared the top of a hill, the troops expected little\r\nopposition before reaching the crest. But while the company was still\r\na considerable distance from the top, elements of the 33d Infantry\r\nRegiment opened up with rifles, machine guns, and grenades. This fire\r\npinned the company down, and the men immediately sought concealment\r\nin the cogon grass. Light machine guns were brought up, but, because\r\nof the steepness of the slope, they were ineffective. Artillery\r\nand mortars fired for two hours against the entrenched Japanese\r\npositions. At 1610 Company E renewed the attack and this time secured\r\nthe hill with little opposition. The 34th Infantry now occupied the\r\nhills on the north side of Highway 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeizure of Hill B\r\n\r\nOn 22 October the 3d Battalion of the 19th Infantry had relieved the\r\n2d Battalion of the regiment at Palo, and the regimental commander\r\nordered the 2d Battalion to proceed against Hill B. [528] Earlier,\r\nthe 2d Battalion had sent patrols out preparatory to attacking the\r\nhill. The 13th Field Artillery Battalion laid maximum supporting fires\r\non Hill B as naval bombers strafed it. [529] The 2d Battalion moved\r\nout to the attack at 1425, and the concentrated artillery fire enabled\r\nit to secure without resistance a ridge east of Hill B and then push\r\non down the road toward the hill. But as Company E, the lead company,\r\nreached the foot of Hill B, it was met by a large group from the 33d\r\nInfantry Regiment coming east down the road and around the hill. The\r\nJapanese had left riflemen dug in on the steep banks of the road and\r\nhad posted others in the trees along the road. Some of these riflemen\r\nallowed part of the American troops to pass and then opened fire. A\r\nsharp fire fight broke out in which Company E killed an estimated\r\nhundred of the enemy before being forced to withdraw to the ridge,\r\nwhere the 2d Battalion dug in for the night. During the night the\r\n13th Field Artillery fired on Hill B. At 0730 the following day the 2d\r\nBattalion sent out two patrols to scout the enemy positions. The patrol\r\non the right flank was stopped by machine gun fire at a point 200 yards\r\nwest of the ridge and was forced to return. Mortar fire was placed\r\non the enemy machine guns, after which the 2d Battalion advanced,\r\nreaching what was believed to be the crest of Hill B at 1530. [530]\r\n\r\nAs the forward progress was more difficult than had been expected, the\r\n2d Squadron of the 12th Cavalry was sent to relieve the 1st Battalion,\r\n19th Infantry, which had been engaged in mopping up Hill 522. [531]\r\nThis relieved battalion was given the mission of attacking Hill 85,\r\nto the south of Palo, where the 24th Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop\r\nhad located a strong enemy position. During the night the artillery\r\nplaced concentrated fire upon Hill 85.\r\n\r\nAt 0800 on 24 October the men of the 2d Battalion moved out,\r\nattempting to complete the capture of Hill B. [532] They were held\r\nup by well-emplaced pillboxes and foxholes on the highest crest of\r\nthe ridge, having discovered that the crest they had first occupied\r\nwas not the true crest. Since the 33d Infantry Regiment seemed to\r\nbe well emplaced on the hill, Lt. Col. Robert B. Spragins had his\r\nbattalion move to the right. It took up a position overlooking a\r\nnarrow asphalt road that ran from Highway 2 to a Japanese supply\r\ndump to the south. Colonel Spragins decided to attack Hill B from\r\nthis position on the following morning.\r\n\r\nThe 13th Field Artillery Battalion again pounded the enemy positions\r\non the hill during the night. On the morning of 25 October the\r\n2d Battalion attacked with Companies G and E abreast. The troops\r\nmoved down the slope, across the road, and up the hill, with no\r\nopposition. On reaching the crest, they were met by heavy fire that\r\ncame from well-constructed emplacements. Some of these positions were\r\nsix feet deep and five feet wide. Very heavy fighting broke out in\r\nwhich the companies were barely able to hold their positions. The\r\n11th and 52d Field Artillery Battalions fired in front of Hill B,\r\n[533] and the enemy fire was silenced. Company E was forced back,\r\nbut Company G held on.\r\n\r\nAlthough the hill was in American hands, the hold was very\r\nprecarious. Colonel Spragins therefore moved the rest of the battalion\r\nup to Company G and ordered the latter to move out to a far ridge\r\nin order to secure the hill firmly. This move was accomplished at\r\ntwilight. The rest of the battalion moved out to join Company G.\r\n\r\nStarting in the dark, the battalion lost its way. At midnight the\r\ntroops came to the true crest of the ridge where the enemy had\r\nan observation post surrounded by prepared positions. All were\r\nempty. The Japanese had formed the habit of going to the villages\r\nfor the night and returning in the morning to man their posts. The\r\nnight movement of the battalion \"literally caught them napping away\r\nfrom their defenses.\" [534] The battalion had not reached Company G,\r\nbut it set up a defensive perimeter for the night. The hills guarding\r\nLeyte Valley were now in American hands.\r\n\r\nDuring the day the 1st Battalion, 19th Infantry, secured complete\r\ncontrol of Hill 85 without opposition. The battalion found an abandoned\r\nposition, mortar ammunition, and six dead Japanese.\r\n\r\nBy the end of 25 October the X Corps had made substantial progress\r\ntoward securing northern Leyte Valley. After capturing Tacloban,\r\nthe 1st Cavalry Division had pushed north and secured control over\r\nSan Juanico Strait. The 24th Division had secured Palo and the hill\r\nfortresses that blocked the entrance into northern Leyte Valley. The\r\ncorps was now in a position to launch a drive into the interior of\r\nthe valley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nNorthern Leyte Valley: Part Two\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Krueger had expected stronger Japanese resistance in the\r\nzone of action of the 1st Cavalry Division than in that of the 24th\r\nDivision. He had therefore thought it safe to release the 21st Infantry\r\nfor the landings at Panaon Strait. When events proved otherwise, a\r\nportion of the strength of the 1st Cavalry Division was shifted into\r\nthe zone of the 24th Division to enable the latter to free itself of\r\nresponsibility for rear areas and direct its effort to the advance\r\ninto Leyte Valley. [535] (Map 11)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDrive up Leyte Valley\r\n\r\nThe Japanese planned to fall back into the mountains if the Americans\r\nwere successful in seizing the Tacloban airfield. They expected to\r\ntake with them \"munition sufficient for one and one-half units of fire\r\nfor one division ... and food for 20,000 men for six month[s].\" [536]\r\nThe rapid advance of the Americans, however, prevented the execution of\r\nthis plan. After 25 October the remaining elements of the 33d Infantry\r\nRegiment withdrew to a position about three and three-fourths miles\r\nnortheast of Jaro. [537] When the American forces had taken the hills\r\ndominating the entrance into Leyte Valley and overlooking Highway 2,\r\nLt. Gen. Sosaku Suzuki, the commander of the 35th Army, concentrated\r\nhis forces around Jaro on the southern edge of Leyte Valley. The 41st\r\nRegiment of the 30th Division and the 169th Independent Battalion of\r\nthe 102d Division, both of which had but recently arrived on Leyte as\r\nreinforcements to the 16th Division, on 26 October were ordered to\r\nproceed from Carigara to Jaro. On the same day the 17th Independent\r\nBattalion, 102d Division, moved toward Jaro. [538]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 34th Infantry Advances Into the Valley\r\n\r\nAfter the successful capture of Hills B and C, the 24th Division\r\nresumed its attack west. With the 1st Cavalry Division protecting\r\nthe 24th Division's northern flank, the 34th Infantry was to proceed\r\nwestward into the interior along Highway 2. The 19th Infantry, as the\r\n24th Division's southern prong, was to follow an almost parallel route\r\nto Pastrana. [539] The 1st Cavalry Brigade was to relieve the combat\r\ntroops of the 24th Division in the rear areas in order to enable the\r\ndivision to continue its advance into the interior.\r\n\r\nHighway 2 was a one-lane all-weather road, twelve feet wide with\r\nfour-foot shoulders. It had a crushed rock and gravel surface. In\r\ngeneral it ran through level ground, with occasional groves of light\r\ntimber, bamboo, and abaca. Much of the area was under cultivation. At\r\nSanta Fe a one-lane all-weather branch road ran four miles south to\r\nPastrana, at which point a seasonal one-lane road ran southward for\r\nabout five miles to Dagami and another northwest for about eight and\r\na half miles to Jaro.\r\n\r\nAt 1000 on 26 October the 2d Battalion of the 34th Infantry, commanded\r\nby Colonel Pearsall, moved out of its assembly area at Malirong in a\r\ncolumn of companies and pushed westward on Highway 2. The battalion\r\nmet slight resistance at the Malirong River bridge, but mortar fire\r\nknocked out the enemy opposition, and the advance continued. Since\r\nthe battalion encountered few Japanese, the flank protection, which\r\nhad to traverse difficult terrain, was called in, and the advance\r\nthen proceeded at a much more rapid pace. The 2d Battalion met,\r\nand killed or routed, small groups of the enemy. It crossed streams\r\nwhere the bridges had been destroyed. The 3d Engineer Battalion put\r\ntemporary structures in for two of these bridges in order that the\r\nfirst elements might proceed, and it placed a Bailey bridge over a\r\nthird stream. The 1st Battalion, which followed the 2d, used Japanese\r\nhandcarts to transport supplies between the destroyed bridges and the\r\nforward troops. [540] By 1730 Colonel Pearsall had all of his battalion\r\nin Sante Fe. The following day, Lt. Col. Thomas E. Clifford, Jr.,\r\nwho had become the commanding officer of the 1st Battalion, pushed\r\nhis unit through the 2d Battalion and advanced 7,000 yards without\r\nopposition to the Mudburon River, where the troops established their\r\nnight perimeter at 1545. [541]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMainit River Bridge\r\n\r\nOn the morning of 28 October Colonel Clifford ordered the 1st Battalion\r\nto move out in a column of companies along Highway 2 toward the town of\r\nAlangalang about a mile and a quarter northwest. At 0900 the battalion\r\nmoved out. Company A, the lead company, entered Alangalang without\r\nincident, set up local security, and then fell to the rear of the\r\nbattalion, which passed through Alangalang [542] without pausing and\r\nmoved toward the Mainit River about one and a half miles farther on.\r\n\r\nAs Company C reached the Mainit River it made contact with the enemy,\r\nwho had dug in on both steeply sloping banks of the river at the\r\nsteel bridge crossing. The company suffered five casualties. It was\r\nopposed by the remaining elements of the 33d Infantry, which had been\r\nconsiderably mauled by the Americans. [543] Company C withdrew 300\r\nyards as Companies B and A pressed forward on the left side of the\r\nroad under continuous rifle fire. Colonel Pearsall's 2d Battalion\r\nhad followed the 1st Battalion, and both units were to make an\r\nassault against the 41st Infantry Regiment, which had arrived in the\r\narea. Three batteries of the 63d Field Artillery Battalion shelled\r\nthe enemy positions for a depth of 300 yards on the eastern side of\r\nthe river and 100 yards on the western side.\r\n\r\nAfter the artillery concentration was over, the two battalions\r\nwere to move out to the attack--the 1st on the left and the 2d on\r\nthe right. The regimental commander ordered the 1st Battalion to\r\nattack, destroy the enemy resistance, and secure the eastern bank\r\nof the river. Five tanks were to follow in the rear of the assault\r\ncompanies and fire at targets of opportunity. Five hundred yards away,\r\nto the right of the 1st Battalion, Companies E and F of Pearsall's\r\nbattalion were to cross the river, destroy enemy resistance on the\r\nwestern side, and then go south on Highway 2 to contact the enemy at\r\nthe bridge. [544]\r\n\r\nThe 1st Battalion moved to the water's edge, where it was pinned\r\ndown by enemy fire. Companies E and F of the 2d Battalion, however,\r\nwere able to push north 500 yards through the heavy brush, and amid\r\na driving rain they managed to ford the river unobserved. Once on\r\nthe other side they charged the entrenchments of the 41st Infantry\r\nRegiment on the river, with Company F in the lead. As Company\r\nF neared the bridge it overran three mortar positions without\r\nstopping but was finally halted by heavy machine gun fire. After the\r\ncompany's 60-mm. mortar had knocked out the machine gun, the unit\r\ncontinued to advance and passed the bridgehead before it ran out of\r\nammunition. Company E then relieved Company F, while the latter set up\r\nheavy machine guns to silence enemy machine guns in the woods to the\r\nwest. By 1500 the bridge was in American hands. The Japanese had placed\r\na demolition charge on the bridge, but the American advance had been\r\nso swift that the enemy never had an opportunity to set off the charge.\r\n\r\nThe 3d Battalion had meanwhile moved up to the rear of the other two\r\nbattalions and established contact south of Santa Fe with the 19th\r\nInfantry, which was protecting the southern flank of the division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeizure of Pastrana\r\n\r\nOn 25 October the 3d Battalion, 19th Infantry, advancing toward\r\nPastrana, had pushed against slight opposition into Castilla and\r\nestablished a perimeter there. [545] On the morning of the same day,\r\nMaj. Elmer C. Howard, the battalion commander, told Lt. Col. George\r\nH. Chapman, Jr., of the 19th Infantry that he had learned from the\r\nFilipinos that there was no organized resistance along the three\r\nmiles from Castilla to Pastrana. He therefore asked permission to\r\ngo to Pastrana and establish a roadblock. Colonel Chapman told Major\r\nHoward to stay out of Pastrana but to send patrols to locate defenses\r\naround the town. [546] Colonel Chapman later rescinded this order,\r\nand at 1300 on 26 October Major Howard moved his battalion out from\r\nCastilla to attack Pastrana, which was 5,000 yards southwest of Santa\r\nFe. Company I, the lead company, proceeded over a trail that was\r\ntoo narrow to accommodate vehicles. At 1600 the point of Company\r\nI reached the outskirts of Pastrana but came under heavy enemy\r\nfire. The battalion pulled back and then attacked with Companies I\r\nand K abreast. The companies were stopped by fire that came from an\r\nunusual fortification--a star-shaped fort, with a tin roof, which\r\nlooked like three or four native shacks in a cluster. The sides\r\nwere banked with earth, over which grass had been allowed to grow--a\r\nfeature so exceptional that it aroused suspicion and gave away the\r\nnature of the installation. Pillboxes flanked the fortification,\r\nwhich was backed by a system of trenches. Colonel Chapman ordered\r\nanother attack at 1630, but casualties were so heavy that the troops\r\ndug in after getting within 100 yards of the fortress.\r\n\r\nAt 1750 Battery C, 11th Field Artillery Battalion, placed fire on\r\nthe fortification, but after forty-two rounds of ammunition had\r\nbeen expended, the battery reported that the muddy ground \"caused\r\n[the] guns to go out of action.\" [547] From 1850 to 1905, Battery\r\nA of the 14th Field Artillery delivered harassing fire on Pastrana,\r\n[548] and from 2200 to 2400 the 13th Field Artillery Battalion took\r\nover the task of placing fire on the sector around the town. [549]\r\nWith the coming of daylight, the 4.2-inch and 81-mm. mortars took\r\nup the shelling. The night-long pounding of the Japanese positions\r\naround Pastrana was so effective that on the morning of 27 October\r\nCompany K of the 3d Battalion was able to move around the town and\r\nestablish a roadblock at a demolished bridge a few hundred yards\r\nsouthwest. The rest of the day the 3d Battalion, assisted by Colonel\r\nZierath's 1st Battalion, which had followed the 3d Battalion, mopped\r\nup in the town and sent out patrols to investigate the terrain and\r\nenemy dispositions west and south of the town.\r\n\r\nThe 19th Infantry was to continue to protect the southern flank of the\r\n24th Division, which was driving toward Carigara, by moving toward\r\nJaro--the proposed assembly point of the 35th Army. On the morning\r\nof 28 October, Colonel Zierath had the 1st Battalion establish a\r\nroadblock north of the Binahaan River in the vicinity of Macalpe. The\r\n2d Battalion pushed forward to Tingib and established a perimeter\r\nthere. For the next two days the 19th Infantry sent out patrols in all\r\ndirections; they met only scattered resistance from the Japanese. On\r\n29 October Company K left Pastrana and established a roadblock\r\nat Ypad. On the following day it moved south from Ypad to Lapdok,\r\nwhere it established contact with elements of the XXIV Corps. On\r\nthe 30th two platoons from Company C encountered about 100 Japanese\r\nat Rizal. The enemy fought aggressively, but resistance ceased after\r\nartillery fire had been placed on the town. It was estimated that the\r\nmajority of the enemy force was killed. As a result of the skirmishes\r\nand patrols, General Makino was unable to establish contact between\r\nelements of the 16th Division at Dagami and those at Jaro. [550]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFall of Jaro\r\n\r\nAt the crossing of the Mainit River, a one-lane all-weather branch\r\nroad runs southwest for about three and a half miles to Jaro, and\r\nthen northwest along the western edge of Leyte Valley for about ten\r\nand a half miles to Carigara on the north coast. At Jaro many dirt\r\nroads and trails branch out in all directions.\r\n\r\nThe drive of the 24th Division toward Carigara was continued as the\r\n34th Infantry, protected by the 19th Infantry on its flank, moved\r\ntoward Jaro. After the seizure of the Mainit River bridge, two tanks\r\nof the 1st Platoon, 603d Tank Company, attached to the 34th Infantry,\r\nscouted north and made contact with forward elements of the 2d Squadron\r\nof the 8th Cavalry, which had arrived in the San Miguel area.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of 28 October Colonel Newman issued orders to the 34th\r\nInfantry for the following day. The 3d Battalion, under Lt. Col. Edward\r\nM. Postlethwait, was to pass through Colonel Clifford's 1st Battalion\r\nand Colonel Pearsall's 2d Battalion and resume the offensive with\r\nCompany L in the lead. From Cavite the battalion would move southwest\r\nalong the road to capture Jaro. Company L would be sufficiently in\r\nadvance to make reconnaissance of the route before the rest of the\r\nbattalion arrived. [551]\r\n\r\nAt 0900 on 29 October, Company L moved out from Cavite, meeting no\r\nresistance until an hour later when it ran into some of the enemy at\r\na point about 100 yards from Galotan. [552] The leading scout spied a\r\nman, whom he thought to be a Filipino, dashing into a shack. When he\r\nshouted for the man to come out, the scout was shot in the head. The\r\ncompany came on and killed the man. It then came under machine gun\r\nfire. Platoons attacked from both flanks against Galotan. Since the\r\nenemy troops had dug in under the shacks, it was slow, bloody work\r\ndigging them out with rifles and grenades. The 3d Platoon, which had\r\nbeen in reserve, closed in when the center of the town was reached and\r\nhelped finish the job. In the meantime another unit of the company,\r\nwhich had been sent to the right on a wide enveloping movement,\r\ncame under fire from a wooded knoll. Artillery and mortar fire soon\r\ndrove the Japanese off. Unable to retreat westward, the enemy moved\r\nnorthward down a stream bed and set up a defensive position 500 yards\r\nwest of the road and opposite the center of the advancing column of the\r\n3d Battalion. Fortunately, since the Antitank Platoon had displaced\r\nforward by sections, one section was in position at this point and\r\nwas able to quickly eliminate the enemy threat. The 3d Battalion\r\nresumed its march and secured Jaro at 1700 without further difficulty.\r\n\r\nBy this time the 19th Infantry had gained control of the area south\r\nand east of Jaro. Junction between the 34th Infantry and 19th Infantry\r\nwas accomplished on 31 October when the 1st Battalion, 19th Infantry,\r\nmoved into Jaro. Other elements of the 19th Infantry were engaged\r\nin mopping up in the Pastrana sector. The 19th and 34th Infantry\r\nRegiments had been able to advance rapidly in their drives through\r\nLeyte Valley, had maintained contact with the 1st Cavalry Division,\r\nand had arrived within ten miles of Carigara Bay.\r\n\r\nBy 28 October the XXIV Corps had nearly secured the southern portion of\r\nLeyte Valley. General Sibert was anxious to have the X Corps advance\r\nrapidly to the shore of Carigara Bay and thus bring all of the valley\r\nunder control of the Sixth Army. The 24th Division was relieved by\r\nthe 1st Cavalry Division of responsibility for protecting the rear\r\nareas from Santa Fe to Cavite. The 24th Division, thus freed, was to\r\ncontinue pressing the attack to its front with the utmost vigor. [553]\r\n\r\nThe American advance had been so rapid that General Suzuki did not\r\nhave sufficient time to put into effect his plan for making Jaro the\r\nassembly ground for the 35th Army. He was forced to use the Carigara\r\narea as the new point of rendezvous for his troops. On the evening\r\nof 28 October Colonel Newman planned his attack for the remaining\r\ndistance to Carigara. He hoped that the troops would make a swift\r\npassage, but later events proved that the Japanese intended to contest\r\nthe advance bitterly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDrive From the North\r\n\r\nAt the close of 27 October the 7th Cavalry, less the 1st Squadron,\r\nwas in reserve, while the 1st Squadron was at Babatngon sending\r\npatrols along the north coast of Leyte and the southwest coast of\r\nSamar. The 1st Squadron of the 8th Cavalry was patrolling Samar in the\r\nLa Paz area and the 2d Squadron of the regiment was patrolling from\r\nits bivouac area in the upper reaches of the Diit River. In order to\r\nprotect the rear of the 24th Division in its forward advance, the 1st\r\nSquadron of the 12th Cavalry, which had been in reserve, was ordered to\r\nCastilla. The squadron closed on Castilla at 1200 on 28 October. [554]\r\n\r\nIn accordance with orders from General Sibert, General Mudge\r\nreassigned the various elements of the 1st Cavalry Division. On 28\r\nOctober General Hoffman issued orders for his 2d Cavalry Brigade to\r\nmove toward Carigara. The 2d Squadron, 8th Cavalry, was to establish\r\na base at San Miguel, secure Cavite with one troop, patrol and mop\r\nup the north and northwest area up to and including the Barugo road,\r\nand maintain contact with patrols of the 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry,\r\nthat would be operating southeast from Barugo. The 1st Squadron,\r\n7th Cavalry, while maintaining a platoon at Santa Cruz and a troop\r\nat Babatngon, was to move to the Barugo-Carigara area and mop up and\r\npatrol the area to the south and southeast. [555]\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this plan. Troop C of the 7th Cavalry was to\r\nproceed by water from Babatngon to Barugo and then overland to feel\r\nout the enemy position in Carigara. Troop C, under 1st Lt. Tower\r\nW. Greenbowe, on 28 October made the overwater and overland movements\r\nwithout incident. The troop entered the eastern end of Carigara without\r\nopposition, but as it neared the main intersection it received fire\r\nfrom several buildings. In anticipation of this contingency, the men\r\nof Troop C had been well deployed when they entered the town, and\r\nwere able to return the fire immediately. As the fight progressed,\r\nthe Japanese transported their dead and wounded to five trucks near\r\nthe beach road. The fire fight continued until late in the afternoon\r\nwhen Lieutenant Greenbowe withdrew his force to Barugo, and evacuated\r\nhis dead and wounded with him. The enemy had suffered an estimated\r\n75 casualties; Greenbowe's force had 3 men killed, 9 wounded, and 1\r\nmissing. The mutilated body of the missing man was found later. [556]\r\n\r\nSince intelligence reports stated that as many as 5,000 Japanese\r\nwere in Carigara, General Sibert decided that the attack on the town\r\nshould be a two-division operation. While the 24th Division was\r\nfighting its way up the road from Jaro to Carigara, additional 2d\r\nCavalry Brigade units assembled in the Barugo area. The 1st Squadron\r\nof the 7th Cavalry joined its C Troop at Barugo on 29 October; the 2d\r\nSquadron, 8th Cavalry, moved from San Miguel to Barugo on 31 October;\r\nand the advance headquarters of the 7th Cavalry Regiment and the\r\n2d Cavalry Brigade arrived at Barugo on 31 October and 1 November,\r\nrespectively. Attached to the 7th Cavalry Regiment was the 2d Squadron,\r\n5th Cavalry, which closed into the Barugo area on 1 November via\r\nCavite and San Miguel. [557]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDrive to Tunga\r\n\r\nOn 29 October the Japanese had prepared new plans for the defense\r\nof Leyte. (See Map 2) In order to simplify planning, the 35th Army\r\nheadquarters was relieved of command responsibility for Samar by\r\nthe 14th Area Army. Almost simultaneously, the 35th Army received\r\nthe erroneous report that the Japanese naval forces had destroyed a\r\nlarge part of the U. S. Navy on 24 and 25 October in engagements off\r\nLeyte and that the losses would prevent the Americans from continuing\r\nthe operation. On the contrary, the American naval forces had secured\r\na decisive victory. The Japanese reverse seriously affected General\r\nSuzuki's attempt to put his new plans for the 35th Army into effect.\r\n\r\nThe plans provided for the calling up of the 102d Division from Panay\r\nand the 1st and 26th Divisions from Luzon. These divisions were to land\r\nat Ormoc and then proceed in three columns northward along Highway 2\r\nthrough Ormoc Valley to the shores of Carigara Bay. They were then to\r\nadvance eastward and destroy the American forces in the area between\r\nTacloban and Tanauan. Since it was assumed that Carigara would remain\r\nin Japanese hands, the 68th Brigade, serving as 35th Army reserve,\r\nwas expected to land in the north in the vicinity of Carigara. At the\r\nsame time the 30th Division was to land at Albuera on the west coast\r\nand drive overland to Burauen, in order to support the operations of\r\nthe main body of the 35th Army. [558]\r\n\r\nAlthough the American naval victory and rapid advance of land forces\r\nprevented the Japanese from bringing this plan to full fruition,\r\nsizable enemy forces opposed the drive of U.S. troops toward\r\nCarigara. About 28 October the 41st Infantry Regiment moved from\r\nCarigara to the southeast section of Jaro. The 169th Independent\r\nInfantry Battalion of the 102d Division, together with a battalion\r\n(Tempei Battalion) of the 57th Independent Mixed Brigade, was in the\r\nCarigara area. The advance elements first engaged the Americans about\r\n30 October. [559] These units, however, continued out past Jaro and\r\ntook up positions in the mountains.\r\n\r\nOn the night of 29 October the 34th Infantry had captured Jaro and was\r\nabout ten miles from Carigara along the Jaro-Carigara highway. (Map\r\n12) At 0800 on 30 October Colonel Newman ordered the 3d Battalion\r\nof the 34th Infantry to start for Carigara down the highway. As the\r\nbattalion left the outskirts of Jaro, with Company L in the lead,\r\nit came under fire from Japanese who were dug in under shacks along\r\nthe road. Upon a call from the commanding officer of Company L,\r\nthe tanks came up in a column, fired under the shacks, and then\r\nretired. The leading platoon was drawn back so that artillery fire\r\nmight be placed on the Japanese, but the enemy could not be located\r\nprecisely enough to use the artillery. Colonel Newman then ordered a\r\ncautious movement forward without artillery support, a squad placed\r\non each side of the road and two tanks in the center. The squads had\r\nadvanced only fifty yards when Japanese fire again pinned them down.\r\n\r\nWhen Colonel Newman came forward and discovered why the advance was\r\nheld up he declared, \"I'll get the men going okay.\" [560] Upon hearing\r\nthat the regimental commander was to lead them, the men started to move\r\nforward. The Japanese at once opened fire with artillery and mortars,\r\nand Colonel Newman was hit in the stomach. Although badly wounded he\r\ntried to devise some means of clearing the situation. After sending\r\na runner back with orders to have Colonel Postlethwait fire on the\r\nJapanese position, he said, \"Leave me here and get mortar fire on\r\nthat enemy position.\" [561] As soon as possible Colonel Newman was\r\nput on a poncho and dragged back to safety. [562]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the troops, unable to move forward, broke contact with\r\nthe Japanese in an orderly fashion. Lt. Col. Chester A. Dahlen, the\r\nregimental executive officer, assumed command and at 1209 ordered that\r\nthe attack be resumed. [563] The 3d Battalion was to move northwest\r\nalong the road to Carigara for 3,000 yards and then set up a night\r\nperimeter. The 2d Battalion, in support astride the highway, was to\r\nsecure the high ground 500 yards northwest of Jaro, while the 1st\r\nBattalion was to move to the town of Jaro from its position at the\r\nMainit River bridge.\r\n\r\nThe artillery concentrated its fire on the area to the front, and\r\nat 1230 the 3d Battalion renewed the attack with Company K on the\r\nleft of the road and Company I on the right. After the troops had\r\nproceeded about 200 yards, heavy artillery, machine gun, mortar,\r\nand rifle fire pinned them down. Company L in the rear thereupon\r\nattempted a flanking movement to the left across an open field but\r\ncame under heavy fire from a ridge that commanded the road. All the\r\ncompanies were forced to pull back. At the end of the day's action,\r\nthe forward elements were still on the outskirts of Jaro.\r\n\r\nDuring the night, the 11th, 52d, and 63d Field Artillery Battalions\r\nfired continuously in support of the 34th Infantry. The corps artillery\r\nplaced harassing and interdiction fire along the Jaro-Carigara\r\nroad. [564]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of 31 October Colonel Dahlen ordered the 3d Battalion\r\nto move toward Tunga along the Jaro-Carigara road. The 2d Battalion\r\nwas to pass through the 3d along the highway, and the 1st Battalion\r\nwas to be prepared to follow the 2d. [565] The 19th Infantry was\r\nto protect the rear of the 34th Infantry and forestall any attempt\r\nby the Japanese to send reinforcements from north of the Binahaan\r\nRiver. The 1st Battalion, 19th Infantry, was to move to Jaro via\r\nTingib and Macanip to assist the 34th Infantry. [566]\r\n\r\nAt 0820 the 3d Battalion, 34th Infantry, supported by the 2d Battalion,\r\nattacked along the Jaro-Carigara highway. Company L went down the\r\nhighway and then to the rear of the hill from which it had been\r\nrepulsed the previous day; Company I moved forward astride the road;\r\nand Company K was in reserve. As advanced elements of Company I reached\r\na stream, they came under intense fire but moved to a position from\r\nwhich they could attack the reverse slope of the hill. Other elements\r\nof the company moved off the road to the top of the hill. When they\r\npushed westward along the crest they discovered another hill behind it.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the troops that had attacked the reverse slope came\r\nunder intense fire from the second hill. Concentrated fire was laid\r\non the second hill and a heavy machine gun was sent to the top of the\r\nfirst. Company I, protected by the fire, was thus able to assault\r\nand take the first hill. Company K, the reserve company, thereupon\r\noccupied the hill. These assaults drove the enemy into Company L, which\r\nwas at the foot of the hill. A determined three-hour fight followed,\r\nand, although at one time elements of the company were driven across\r\nthe highway, the company retaliated and eventually cleared the area\r\nof Japanese.\r\n\r\nWhile this fight was going on the 2d Battalion, with Company E as\r\nthe point, moved along the highway toward Tunga. At 1130 the Japanese\r\nopened fire on Company E at the Ginagan River. Tanks, which had been\r\nbrought up, fired with machine guns at the enemy positions on the left\r\nof the road. The Japanese retaliated with mortar and artillery fire,\r\npinning down an antitank gun crew and Company E's mortar section. The\r\nartillery fired a concentration on the Japanese positions and the\r\nadvance was able to continue.\r\n\r\nAt 1430 the enemy reopened fire on the 2d Battalion at the Yapan\r\nRiver. Company G was in the lead, with the 2d Platoon on the left of\r\nthe road and the 3d Platoon on the right. Company E was on Company\r\nG's left flank. With all the troops in a skirmish line, the 2d\r\nBattalion, with tanks, moved down the road to attack. When Company\r\nG came under fire the tanks went to its assistance, and the Japanese\r\nthen concentrated their fire on the armor.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Company E pushed down the left side of the road but was\r\nhalted by fire from an enemy pillbox on a knoll. A self-propelled\r\n105-mm. howitzer was brought up, and fire from this weapon\r\ncompletely disorganized the Japanese and forced them to desert their\r\nposition. When the howitzer had exhausted its ammunition, another\r\nwas brought up to replace it. By this time, however, the enemy's\r\nartillery was registering on the spot and the second was disabled\r\nbefore it could fire a shot.\r\n\r\nElements of the 41st Infantry Regiment, protected by artillery,\r\ngathered in front of Company E and emplaced machine guns in a position\r\nfrom which they could enfilade the company. Thereupon Company E\r\ncommitted its reserve platoon to its left flank but shortly afterward\r\nreceived orders to protect the disabled howitzer and dig in for the\r\nnight. A tank was sent up to cover the establishment of the night\r\nperimeter. Company G received orders to fall back and dig in for the\r\nnight, and upon its withdrawal the Japanese concentrated their fire\r\non Company E. Although badly shaken, Company E held on and protected\r\nthe howitzer. A tank was sent forward to tow the weapon, but since it\r\nwas untowable because of broken treads the crew sent a shell through\r\nit to prevent its use by the enemy. Company E then disengaged and\r\nfell back through Company F, as Company G had done.\r\n\r\nUnder the protective cover of night, the 41st Infantry Regiment\r\nretreated.\r\n\r\nDuring the day the 19th Infantry had followed closely, protecting the\r\nrear of the 34th Infantry and the southern flank of the 24th Division\r\nand blocking off the enemy escape routes. That night General Irving\r\ngave the plan of action for the following day--1 November--for the\r\n24th Division. The 19th Infantry was to continue to block the enemy\r\nescape routes and protect the southern flank of the division along\r\nthe Binahaan River east from Tingib to Yapad, move a battalion into\r\nJaro, establish a roadblock in the vicinity of Jaro, and protect the\r\nline of communications behind the advance of the 34th Infantry as\r\nfar as Gibucauan. The 34th Infantry was to continue advancing along\r\nthe Jaro-Carigara highway, seizing every opportunity to make a wide\r\nenvelopment, especially from the northeast. [567]\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this order, Companies A and B, 34th Infantry,\r\nwere sent at 0820 to make a wide flanking movement eastward to Tuba\r\nand then strike at Tunga from the northeast. At 0900, after patrols\r\nhad reported no enemy contact, the 2d Battalion moved on down the\r\nJaro-Carigara highway.\r\n\r\nBoth battalions proceeded rapidly. At 0900 the 1st Battalion was in\r\nTuba, and at 1100 the 2d had passed through the scene of the previous\r\nday's fighting and was in Giagsam. The troops found much matériel,\r\nincluding two 37-mm. guns and numerous range finders, machine guns,\r\nrifles, packs, and helmets, which the enemy had left in his precipitous\r\nflight. Both battalions closed on Tunga. They paused for rest and\r\nthen moved on down the highway toward Carigara. At 1600 when the 34th\r\nInfantry formed its perimeter for the night, its advance unit, the\r\n1st Battalion, was 1,000 yards from Sagkanan, and its rearmost unit,\r\nthe 3d Battalion, was at Tunga. [568]\r\n\r\nOn the previous day the regimental headquarters had moved into Jaro. It\r\nhad been a bloody road to Carigara, but the 24th Division was knocking\r\nat the back door for admittance as the 1st Cavalry Division on the\r\nnorth was demanding entrance at the front door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCapture of Carigara\r\n\r\nBy 31 October it became evident to the Americans that there was unusual\r\nactivity on the part of the Japanese, who were apparently building\r\nstrong defensive positions around Carigara and pouring reinforcements\r\ninto the town. Statements by reconnaissance parties and reports from\r\nguerrillas led to the belief that 2,000 to 3,000 Japanese were in\r\nthe town and its environs. [569] The enemy was capable of bringing\r\nup a considerable number of reinforcements along the Ormoc road,\r\nor of attacking the American left flank from the south. [570] The\r\nsituation remained unchanged on 1 November.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlans of X Corps\r\n\r\nIn view of the apparent strength of the Japanese defenders,\r\nGeneral Sibert felt that no means should be left untried to insure\r\nthe successful reduction of the strong point. Both the corps and\r\ndivision artillery were to fire on the town, with a heavy 15-minute\r\npreparation from 0745 to 0800 on the front of the 24th Infantry\r\nDivision to a depth of 1,000 yards. Immediately thereafter a series of\r\nconcentrations covering 1,000 yards in depth would be fired from 0800\r\nto 0840, advancing at the rate of 100 yards every four minutes. All\r\navailable artillery except one light battalion of the 24th Infantry\r\nDivision would then fire in front of the 1st Cavalry Division to a\r\ndepth of 1,000 yards from 0845 to 0900. Thereafter the artillery of\r\neach division would support its own division. [571]\r\n\r\nThe 2d Brigade, reinforced, was to seize Carigara from Barugo,\r\n[572] while the 34th Infantry would attack along the Jaro-Carigara\r\nhighway. General Hoffman of the 2d Cavalry Brigade commanded the attack\r\nagainst Carigara. In preparation for the combined assault, the forces\r\nof the 1st Cavalry Division had been gathering in the Barugo area.\r\n\r\nOn 1 November General Hoffman arrived at Barugo, examined the troops,\r\nand made last-minute arrangements. The assault from the north was to\r\nbe in a column of squadrons: 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry; 2d Squadron,\r\n8th Cavalry; and the 2d Squadron, 5th Cavalry, in reserve. The squadron\r\nlast mentioned was to establish and maintain communication with the\r\n34th Infantry, which was to move out in a column of battalions, wait\r\non the outskirts of Carigara until the town had been secured by the 2d\r\nCavalry Brigade, and then flank the town and move on to Capoocan. [573]\r\n\r\nDuring the day of 1 November and the night following, General Suzuki\r\nwithdrew his troops from Carigara and established very strong\r\npositions in the mountains southwest of the town in the vicinity\r\nof Limon. By \"clever deception as to his strength and intentions,\"\r\nthe enemy completely deluded the Americans into believing that his\r\nmajor force was still in Carigara. [574]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeizure of Carigara\r\n\r\nUnaware of the Japanese withdrawal, the Americans proceeded with\r\nthe execution of their plans. During the American artillery fire on\r\nthe morning of 2 November some of the shells landed in the sector of\r\nthe 7th Cavalry, an accident which delayed the attack until 0935. At\r\nthat hour the 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry, followed by the 2d Squadron,\r\n8th Cavalry, jumped off. Since the bridge over the Canomontag River\r\nhad been destroyed by the enemy and the river was not fordable,\r\nit was necessary to utilize native canoes, only two of which were\r\navailable. This procedure consumed much time, but by 1130 the troops\r\ncompleted the crossing. Troop E, 5th Cavalry, made contact with the\r\n34th Infantry at 1100. Since the troops encountered no resistance, the\r\n1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry, followed by the 2d Squadron, 8th Cavalry,\r\nentered the town at 1200 and established a perimeter. General Mudge,\r\nthe commander of the 1st Cavalry Division, entered the town with the\r\nassault cavalry troops. [575] The 2d Squadron, 8th Cavalry, outposted\r\nthe western and southern sections of the town. Patrols from the 34th\r\nInfantry were already in Carigara.\r\n\r\nAt 0800 on 2 November the 34th Infantry moved out, the 1st Battalion\r\nleaving its bivouac area 1,000 yards southeast of Sagkanan and going\r\ndown the highway, followed by the 2d Battalion, less Company G, and\r\nthe 3d Battalion. Company G of the 2d Battalion was to reconnoiter\r\nthe western side of Carigara in case an enveloping movement became\r\nnecessary. [576]\r\n\r\nBy 0900 the 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry, reached a small bridge\r\nat the outskirts of Carigara and awaited word from the 1st Cavalry\r\nDivision. After a wait of one and a half hours, patrols were sent\r\ninto the western portion of Carigara, but they reported no enemy\r\ncontact. All was quiet and the town deserted. The battalion then\r\nskirted Carigara and proceeded along the coast toward Capoocan. It\r\nencountered difficulty in crossing the Carigara River, since the\r\nbridge had been destroyed, but was able to get as far as Balud, where\r\nit set up a night perimeter after being halted by enemy fire. The\r\n2d Battalion moved to the Carigara River, where it dug in for the\r\nnight and was rejoined there by G Company. The 3d Battalion set up\r\nits perimeter just behind the 2d, and the regimental headquarters of\r\nthe 34th Infantry was set up in Carigara.\r\n\r\nIn the advance through northern Leyte Valley the 24th Division had\r\nlost 210 killed, 859 wounded, and 6 missing in action, but it had\r\nkilled an estimated 2,970 Japanese and taken 13 prisoners.\r\n\r\nWith the capture of Carigara, the second phase of General Krueger's\r\nplan for the liberation of Leyte was completed. Panaon and San\r\nJuanico Straits, respectively south and north of the island, had\r\nbeen seized. Elements of the Sixth Army were on the west coast in\r\nthe vicinity of Baybay on the shores of Ormoc Bay, and others were at\r\nCarigara near the northern entrance to Ormoc Valley. The two forces\r\nwere poised for a co-ordinated drive toward Ormoc Valley--the last\r\nimportant Japanese stronghold on the island. Nearly all the tactically\r\nsignificant airfields and ports, together with Leyte Valley, were in\r\nthe hands of the Sixth Army. Victory appeared to be in sight--but\r\ncontinued reinforcement of the island by the Japanese and delay in\r\nthe construction program for building Leyte Valley into a major air\r\nand supply base were matters of grave concern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nLogistics and Civil Affairs\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old saw that for want of a horseshoe nail the kingdom was lost\r\nis applicable in some degree to the story of logistics on the island\r\nof Leyte. Fortunately the outcome in Leyte was less serious than that\r\nrecounted in the proverb. But the cumulative effect of many unfavorable\r\nconditions, each capable of being overcome in itself but each entangled\r\nwith the others, resulted in a protraction of the campaign and a\r\nslowing of the schedule for future operations in the Pacific.\r\n\r\nDespite the forebodings of Sixth Army engineers with regard to\r\ndeveloping major logistical and air bases in Leyte Valley, General\r\nMacArthur had assigned logistical missions to the Sixth Army which,\r\neven under the best of circumstances, would have taxed its facilities\r\nto the utmost. General Krueger thought that in the planning stages\r\ngreater emphasis should have been placed on an appreciation of\r\nterrain when selecting landing beaches and their exits, as well as\r\nsites for base development, airdrome construction, and headquarters\r\ninstallations. Terrain information should have been carefully analyzed\r\nby competent personnel in order that tactical and development plans\r\ncould be based on the utilization of suitable terrain. The target\r\ndates and phase lines should have been flexible enough to allow for\r\nunsatisfactory terrain features. \"Airdromes cannot be built speedily\r\nacross rice paddies and swamps; bivouac areas, depots and dumps cannot\r\nproperly be established in swamps and rice paddies.\" [577]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLogistics\r\n\r\nScarcely had the assault troops landed when the gloomy predictions\r\nof Colonel Ely that conditions of soil and weather on the island\r\nwould make it unfit for the establishment of major bases began to\r\nbe realized. Nevertheless, the necessity for early establishment of\r\nland-based air forces to support the operation made it imperative\r\nthat the engineers start work immediately on rehabilitation of\r\nexisting airfields. Before this task could be carried out, however,\r\nit would be necessary to strengthen and widen the roads in order to\r\nmove heavy construction equipment to the airfields. A breakdown of\r\nthe transportation system for even a few days could affect adversely\r\nall aspects of the Leyte operation. Because of the shortage of\r\nengineer troops, the lack of road metal, and the continuous traffic,\r\nthe construction and maintenance of roads presented a critical and\r\ncontinuing problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoad Construction\r\n\r\nThe troops found their progress greatly hampered by the poor quality\r\nof roads leading to the interior of the island. The type of soil made\r\nit difficult to provide sufficient approach roads and to maintain\r\nall-weather roads. Drivers did not dare come too near the edge of the\r\npavement in passing, even on the major two-lane roads, since their\r\nvehicles would probably become mired on the shoulder. The edges of\r\nhard-surfaced roads broke down under the constant wear until the\r\nroads were no longer wide enough for two-way traffic. Vehicles would\r\noften sink to their axles on the shoulders of the highway and on the\r\nmany access roads, and frequently the roads into camp areas became\r\nunsuitable for traffic of any sort. [578]\r\n\r\nIn the 24th Division zone the engineers undertook to build an ancillary\r\nroad, from the beachhead area to the existing coastal road, over the\r\ndeep swamps and flooded rice paddies. After twenty-four hours' labor\r\nthey abandoned the project as not feasible and in a few days rebuilt a\r\ntrail that skirted the swamp along higher ground. This new thoroughfare\r\nwas pronounced an \"excellent\" three-lane egress road. [579]\r\n\r\nBy utilizing a narrow road leading inland to Highway 1, egress from\r\nthe 1st Cavalry Division beachhead area was accomplished. Since\r\nthe road forked near the beach and ran north to Cataisan Point it\r\nbecame an access road to the Tacloban airfield. All supplies were\r\nrouted along Highway 1 into the interior. When this road went to\r\npieces under the heavy rains of 25 October, no means remained of\r\ngetting overland from the area of the 24th Division to that of the 1st\r\nCavalry Division. The open country back of the Dulag area made the road\r\nproblems of the XXIV Corps zone a little more manageable than those in\r\nthe X Corps area. Dulag itself offered graveled streets for traffic,\r\nbut unfortunately only one very narrow road, with deep ditches on both\r\nsides, led west toward the mountains. With the coming of heavy rains,\r\nthis road was chewed to bits by heavy traffic.\r\n\r\nIn order to preserve the roads as far as possible, the transportation\r\nofficer of the Sixth Army decided to allow their use only to\r\nvehicles having the highest priority and to hold the transportation\r\nof civilians to a minimum. He forbade the use of trucks and other\r\nheavy vehicles for carrying personnel when lighter transportation\r\nwas available. [580] Throughout the Leyte operation, though the\r\nengineering troops worked unceasingly, the condition of the roads\r\nremained a tremendous unsolved problem. A rainfall of 23.5 inches\r\nduring the month of November forced a continuous contest with the mud,\r\nand men and equipment employed on the airstrips had to be diverted to\r\nthe roads, some of which were closed for days at a time while under\r\nrepair. Traffic censuses were made as a basis for many corrective\r\nmeasures that were introduced to control, reduce, and equalize the\r\nflow of traffic. Supplies were issued at night to avoid congestion at\r\npeak periods. ASCOM made strong efforts to keep the road construction\r\nequipment in use and in workable condition, and placed stress upon\r\nprovision for proper drainage. Filipino pick-and-shovel crews were\r\nused as much as possible. In spite of these measures, at the end of\r\nNovember the condition of the roads was \"a major hindrance to base\r\ndevelopment and operations.\" [581]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAirfields\r\n\r\nThe condition of the airstrips produced an even more perplexing\r\nproblem than the roads. Immediately upon their arrival, engineer\r\nreconnaissance parties followed the assault infantry and examined\r\nthe various sites which had been selected during the planning for\r\nairfields. By 22 October they reported that all the proposed airdrome\r\nsites except Tacloban were unfit for use during the rainy season.\r\n\r\nElements of the Sixth Army had captured both the Dulag and Tacloban\r\nairstrips within twenty-four hours after landing, but the Dulag\r\nairstrip was found to be out of use and unserviceable. [582] Since\r\nthe Tacloban field was shorter than had been estimated and was in\r\nneed of resurfacing, it was necessary to construct practically a\r\nnew airfield. Although Japanese air resistance was moderate for the\r\nfirst few days and the weather temperate, progress was slow because of\r\nthe condition of the roads and congestion of traffic. Trucks bearing\r\ngravel moved at a snail's pace.\r\n\r\nOn 25 October the 7th and 8th Fighter Squadrons of the 49th Fighter\r\nGroup assisted in the work on the Tacloban strip. The 8th Squadron\r\nwas dismayed. The entire Cataisan Peninsula, on which the airstrip\r\nwas located, was an \"unadulterated bog\" and the \"confusion was awe\r\ninspiring.\" Labor details were called to work and then dismissed. Upon\r\nreturning to their bivouac area, they would be recalled, and the\r\nprocess repeated. [583] On 25 and 26 October the Japanese air force\r\ncame over the airfield in great waves. Many times the men were forced\r\nto drop their tools and sprawl into gullies and slit trenches as the\r\nJapanese \"returned for more blood.\" [584]\r\n\r\nWith the naval battle of Leyte Gulf under way, activities on the\r\nairfield were further hampered. Construction crews attempted to lay\r\na base of coral on the airfield for the steel matting at the same\r\ntime that Navy planes used the field for emergency landings. About\r\na hundred aircraft used the field on 25 October, and twenty-five of\r\nthese were destroyed in crash landings, one of which set the fuel\r\ndump afire at night. [585] In spite of enemy air raids, the landing\r\nof naval aircraft and the wrecked planes littering the airstrip,\r\nconstruction continued. By 30 October some aircraft were arriving\r\nand making satisfactory landings on the runway, which at that time\r\nhad nearly 4,000 feet of matting. [586]\r\n\r\nOn 27 October the Fifth Air Force took over the mission of supplying\r\nair support. Because of the poor condition of the airstrips and\r\nthe scarcity of available aircraft, however, it was announced on\r\n31 October that only \"sporadic bomb support by the heavy bombers\"\r\nand strafing could be accomplished. Work on the airstrips had barely\r\ngot under way at the end of October. [587]\r\n\r\nAt the same time General Casey, commanding the Army Service Command,\r\npainted a dark picture of the future. He stated that the construction\r\nof airfields in the Dulag area would require more effort than had\r\nbeen anticipated during the planning phase, since the Japanese,\r\ncontrary to expectations, had placed little or no surfacing material\r\non the runways and since soil conditions were such that an eight-inch\r\nsand and gravel base covered with steel mat would be required to\r\nsupport bomber traffic. [588] Furthermore, the labor crews that\r\nwere to have been used in airfield construction were being diverted\r\nto road building, still further reducing \"the already insufficient\r\namount of engineer effort available for drome construction.\" [589]\r\nAside from labor shortages, the chief causes for the disappointing\r\ndelay in airfield construction were poor soil conditions, enemy air\r\nraids, and rain. [590] Under such inauspicious circumstances, the\r\nAllied Air Forces undertook the mission of furnishing air support on\r\nLeyte. Because of the poor condition of the airfields, only a token\r\nforce from the Fifth Air Force was able to come in.\r\n\r\nMuch ingenuity was exercised by the engineers in overcoming\r\ndifficulties. In enlarging the Tacloban airstrip, one of the\r\ngreatest impediments to progress was the limited supply of coral for\r\nsurfacing the runways. The engineers conceived the idea of having\r\nthe dredge Raymond, which had been brought forward to dredge the\r\nnavigational channel, used to pump coral from the channel bottom\r\nonto the runways. The 2,800-horsepower pumps could transport solid\r\nmatter one mile through pipes that extended across the bay and onto\r\nthe land, and they could also raise the dredged matter as much as 300\r\nfeet above sea level. The engineers found that this pipeline was the\r\nquickest way to transport material to the Tacloban airstrip, though\r\nmechanical difficulties sometimes developed. [591]\r\n\r\nDespite constant work on the morasses that constituted the San Pablo\r\nand Buri airfields, these strips continued to be in a generally\r\nunusable condition. Finally, on 25 November, ASCOM dropped all\r\nconstruction work on them. The Fifth Air Force, however, felt that\r\nit was necessary to continue using the Bayug airfield, and at least\r\none aviation battalion remained at work on that strip.\r\n\r\nWhen work on the airstrips at Buri and San Pablo was abandoned, the\r\nSixth Army units thus released began the construction of a new airfield\r\non the coast at Tanauan, midway between Tacloban and Dulag. This field\r\nbecame operational on 16 December 1944. [592] The fact that the main\r\npart of the Fifth Air Force was unable to displace forward to Leyte\r\nmade it possible for the Japanese to reinforce their Leyte garrison\r\nand thus prolong the campaign.\r\n\r\nAlthough his engineers, before the opening of the campaign, had\r\nprotested vigorously to General Headquarters against the establishment\r\nof a major base upon Leyte, General Krueger felt constrained to take\r\nthe responsibility. Said he:\r\n\r\n\r\n    There is no doubt that if I could have made adequate airdromes\r\n    available on Leyte as scheduled we would have had ample air forces\r\n    on hand to stop all Jap reinforcements from coming in. But this\r\n    proved to be impossible, because of terrific rains that flooded\r\n    all level areas on the island. In consequence, we lacked the air\r\n    support necessary adequately to support the operation. This was\r\n    not the fault of the Allied Air Force, however, but mine. [593]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBase Construction\r\n\r\nAfter the assault troops had cleared the beach areas, a perplexing\r\nproblem came to the fore. In the plans for the Leyte operation General\r\nKrueger had assigned to the various commands areas for such facilities\r\nas their supply dumps and hospitals. Upon arrival on Leyte, the Army\r\nService Command discovered that many of the sites were swamps; the\r\ntactical situation delayed reconnaissance for others.\r\n\r\nThroughout November the allocation of areas to the units continued to\r\npresent difficulties. On 12 November General Krueger formed the Area\r\nAllocation Group, which consisted of representatives from MacArthur's\r\nGeneral Headquarters, the Sixth Army, the Air Forces, the Navy,\r\nand the Army Service Command. The various units submitted requests\r\nfor particular areas to this group, which accepted or rejected the\r\nrequests, or allocated different sites. Since many of the applicants\r\nwished to be in the Tacloban area, some of the requests could not\r\nbe granted because of insufficient space. Many of the sites best\r\nsuited for hospitals or storage were occupied by MacArthur's advance\r\nheadquarters and other headquarters. The search of ASCOM for suitable\r\nstorage areas continued throughout the month. [594] On 28 November\r\nGeneral Krueger moved the Sixth Army command post from Tanauan\r\nto Tolosa so that an airstrip could be constructed in the Tanauan\r\narea. [595]\r\n\r\nBy 20 November General Krueger's program for hospital construction\r\nwas far behind schedule. Of the eight hospitals planned for the\r\narea only one was as much as 34 percent complete, and one was only\r\n5 percent complete. [596] The lack of hospital facilities, which\r\ncontinued throughout December, was somewhat offset by the rate of\r\nevacuation and the use of hospital ships and LST's operating under\r\nnaval medical procedure. Next to airfields and roads the construction\r\nof hospitals was given priority. But \"an adequate number of engineer\r\nbattalions ... to do justice to the original requirements\" was\r\nnot available. At the same time General Krueger ordered that the\r\nhospitals be given first priority on structural materials and on\r\nportable buildings. No lumber, including ship dunnage, could be used\r\nin constructing quarters for either officers or enlisted men until the\r\nhospitals were completed. [597] All units that could be spared from\r\nairdrome and road construction were used to build either hospitals\r\nor port and POL (petrol, oil, and lubricants) installations.\r\n\r\nAs for port facilities, the Japanese failed to destroy two existing\r\ndeepwater berths at Tacloban. Despite numerous enemy aerial attacks on\r\nthese docks and on shipping, no material damage resulted. By 1 December\r\nASCOM had constructed an additional dock and several lighterage\r\nwharves. During November the Army Service Command established, in\r\naddition to the main supply base at Tacloban, a subbase at Dulag for\r\nthe southern areas and a supply point at Carigara for the troops of\r\nX Corps. [598]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSupplies\r\n\r\nSince the assault troops had brought with them only limited supplies\r\nand ammunition and since they were deep inside Japanese territory\r\nand 1,500 miles from their nearest supply base, at Hollandia, the\r\nneed for immediate establishment and stocking of supply bases was\r\nespecially urgent. [599]\r\n\r\nBecause some of the LST's offshore in the vicinity of Hill 522 and\r\nPalo were heavily shelled by the Japanese on A Day, the remaining LST's\r\nwere directed to the Cataisan Peninsula, where many of them discharged\r\ntheir loads on the Tacloban airfield, over which the supplies were\r\nscattered. The proposed runway and dispersal areas were strewn with\r\nhundreds of vehicles, together with thousands of tons of ammunition,\r\nrations, and petroleum products. Since there was only one egress road,\r\nthe airstrip became tremendously congested. [600]\r\n\r\nAnother important cause of the congestion was the dictum of General\r\nHeadquarters that certain airfields were to be operational by an\r\nearly date. The Air Forces had therefore loaded the vessels with a\r\nconsiderable number of service troops and a quantity of equipment\r\nwhich could not be used until the airfields were in operation. When\r\nconstruction of the airfields was delayed, these troops and equipment\r\nwere unemployed for many days, thus cluttering the beaches and adding\r\nto the congestion. Ironically, because of limited shipping space,\r\nthey had displaced \"engineers and other service troops which would\r\nhave been of great value.\" [601]\r\n\r\nOn 8 November an estimated 120,000 American troops were on\r\nLeyte. The rations of some of these were on board the vessels that\r\nhad brought them to the island, and cargo was not being discharged\r\nat a satisfactory rate. Col. William N. Leaf, the supply officer of\r\nthe Sixth Army, did not believe that more than sufficient rations,\r\nclothing, and construction equipment to meet minimum requirements\r\ncould be unloaded unless the discharge capacity of the ports was\r\nsubstantially increased. While this condition was not entirely\r\nsatisfactory, it was not as bad as appeared, since incoming units\r\nbrought and discharged thirty days' supply for themselves. [602]\r\nGeneral Krueger set up a committee to determine the priority\r\nof discharge for the various classes of cargo. On 9 November the\r\ncommittee gave top priority to the following items, in order of\r\npreference: ammunition, 1,400 tons a day; rations, 1,000 tons a day;\r\nbridge timber, no specified amount; landing field mats, 500 tons a day;\r\nand aviation gasoline, 1,000 drums a day. [603]\r\n\r\nOn 27 November the priorities committee reviewed the status of\r\nshipping in the harbors and established new priorities for the\r\nunloading of cargo. In order of priority, the following commodities\r\nwere given preference: rations, ammunition, landing mats, and aviation\r\ngasoline. [604] Not all the vessels followed the priorities that had\r\nbeen set up for the discharge of cargo. General Krueger ordered that\r\n\"appropriate disciplinary action\" be taken against any Army personnel\r\nwho were responsible. [605]\r\n\r\nSince successive resupply convoys arrived at Leyte before vessels of\r\nthe preceding echelon had been unloaded, thus congesting the harbor,\r\nand since the Japanese were bombing the vessels, the assistant G-4\r\nof Sixth Army suggested on 2 December that the number of vessels\r\nto be called forward from the rear area to be kept to an absolute\r\nminimum. [606] The time allocated for the discharge of cargo was\r\nsteadily increased: from 20 October to 3 November it was twelve hours\r\na day, from 4 November to 8 November eighteen hours a day, and from\r\n9 November until Christmas, twenty-four hours a day. [607]\r\n\r\nDuring the first thirty days the supplies in tons, stockpiled\r\non Leyte or available on board ship for discharge, over and above\r\ncurrent needs, increased as follows: 20 October, 30,313; 21 October\r\nthrough 30 October, 128,051; 31 October through 9 November, 193,838;\r\nand from 10 November through 19 November, 319,418. [608]\r\n\r\nAfter the supplies were ashore and stored, the problem of getting\r\nthem to the divisions and thence to the front-line troops presented\r\ntremendous difficulties. Nearly all types of transportation were\r\nutilized. As the roads disintegrated, more and more dependence was\r\nplaced upon water transportation. Naval vessels and amphibian vehicles\r\nwere used to carry the supplies as close as possible to the front-line\r\ntroops, and motor vehicles transported them for the remaining distance\r\nwhenever feasible. At other times the troops and Filipino civilians\r\noften had to hand-carry supplies to the assault forces. In addition\r\nthere were many airdrops to troops who were otherwise completely cut\r\noff from the rest of the Sixth Army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMedical Support\r\n\r\nAs the assault forces moved across the beaches, medical units\r\naccompanied them. The 110th Portable Surgical Hospital supported the\r\noperations of the 6th Ranger Infantry Battalion in the islands of\r\nLeyte Gulf. In the northern part of Leyte the 19th and 27th Portable\r\nSurgical Hospitals went ashore with the 1st Cavalry Division in the\r\nTacloban area, while the 16th Portable Surgical Hospital supported\r\nthe 24th Infantry Division in the Palo area. The 38th and 58th\r\nEvacuation Hospitals also landed on A Day in the X Corps zone but\r\ndid not establish themselves in positions to receive patients. In\r\nthe zone of action of XXIV Corps in the vicinity of Dulag, the 7th\r\nand 96th Infantry Divisions were accompanied by the 51st and 52d\r\nPortable Surgical Hospitals, the 394th Medical Clearing Company, and\r\nthe 644th and 645th Medical Collecting Companies. Later in the day a\r\nplatoon from the 69th Field Hospital landed and before nightfall was\r\nready to receive patients. Earlier on the same day the 7th Portable\r\nSurgical Hospital had accompanied the 21st Infantry Regiment to Panaon\r\nStrait. [609]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvacuation of Casualties\r\n\r\nGeneral Bradley attached to each assault battalion a platoon\r\nfrom one of the collecting companies of the 96th Division Medical\r\nBattalion. These platoons landed with the assault waves, collected\r\nthe casualties on the beach, gave them the necessary treatment, and\r\nthen evacuated them to designated ships by landing craft. After the\r\nNavy beach parties had established aid stations the medical units\r\ncleared casualties through them. [610]\r\n\r\nAs the battle moved on beyond the beaches, the remaining medical units\r\ncame ashore and hospitals were put into operation. For the first few\r\ndays, however, the medical units evacuated all casualties to naval\r\nvessels in the harbor, whereupon the vessels sailed for a rear area\r\nbase. It frequently happened that a man with a minor wound or illness,\r\nor a nonbattle injury, would be well and fit for further duty by the\r\ntime the vessel reached the rear area. [611]\r\n\r\nAfter the campaign had progressed beyond the beaches, both the\r\ncorps evacuated to rear areas only those casualties who required\r\nprolonged hospitalization. The Filipino civilian employees of the\r\nArmy and members of the Filipino armed forces received treatment but\r\nwere not evacuated from the island without approval from Sixth Army\r\nheadquarters. Wounded or sick Japanese prisoners were segregated\r\nin the hospitals but, otherwise, they received the same treatment\r\nas other patients. [612] Within three days after landing, the XXIV\r\nCorps set up a field hospital which was ready to receive patients on\r\nthe following day. Consequently, all casualties who had already been\r\nevacuated to the ships but who required hospitalization for less than\r\nfifteen days were brought ashore and held in the shore party medical\r\nsection or admitted to the hospital. [613]\r\n\r\nCo-operation between the medical services of the Sixth Army and those\r\nof the Seventh Fleet was excellent. Col. William A. Hagins, Sixth Army\r\nSurgeon, praised the medical service of the Seventh Fleet in unstinting\r\nterms: \"The LST's equipped to provide surgical service conformed to\r\nthe highest professional standards and they, together with the APH's\r\n(transports for wounded) and the small PCE(R)'s (patrol craft, escort\r\n(rescue)) formed a floating hospital reserve that varied between\r\n3,000 and 5,000 beds. Without this service, which relieved the hard\r\npressed hospitals of many cases, the level of medical and surgical\r\ncare on Leyte would certainly have been sub-standard.\" [614]\r\n\r\nAfter the action had progressed beyond the beaches, the evacuation of\r\ntroops became more difficult. Each medical collecting company of the\r\n96th Division was furnished nine 1/4-ton trucks and three other cargo\r\ncarriers. The swamps and steep hills precluded the use of trucks,\r\nhowever, and the number of cargo carriers was insufficient for the\r\ntask. The latter were most useful in evacuating casualties across\r\nswamps and rice paddies. It was necessary to use litter bearers in\r\nthe mountains, but the narrow trails permitted the use of only two\r\nmen to carry each litter. For some unexplained reason, attempts to\r\nuse Filipinos as litter bearers were not successful. [615] The 24th\r\nDivision, unlike the 96th, found the Filipinos to be excellent litter\r\nbearers and recommended their use whenever possible, since they were\r\nwilling workers who conserved the efficiency of a combat unit by\r\nreplacing the combat soldiers. [616]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMedical Treatment\r\n\r\nWith very few exceptions, all casualties were treated within one\r\nhour after the wound had been inflicted. At the forward aid stations\r\nthe wounded soldier received only initial treatment necessary before\r\nevacuation to the collecting station. When the casualty arrived at\r\nthat point, he was bathed and prepared for further evacuation to a\r\nclearing station. There the necessary surgery was performed to make\r\nthe patient safe for further evacuation, and he was then taken to a\r\nrear area. Because of the swamps and steep hills in the 96th Division\r\nsector, the time lag in evacuation from the forward aid station to\r\nthe clearing station varied from one hour to thirty hours. [617] In\r\nthe 24th Division zone, the clearing stations remained mobile. Only\r\nin rare instances, where it was impossible to remove patients because\r\nof heavy fighting, was a casualty more than four hours in reaching\r\nthe clearing station. [618]\r\n\r\nInitial measures at the aid stations consisted of treatment for\r\nshock, stopping hemorrhage, administering plasma, applying splints,\r\nand dressing wounds. At the clearing stations and portable surgical\r\nhospitals, the initial surgical care consisted mainly of débridements,\r\nemergency laparotomies, and amputations. The medical officer performed\r\nsurgical operations in these forward medical facilities only when\r\nit was thought that the wounded soldier could not stand the arduous\r\ntrip to the rear or when his condition would not permit the delay\r\nnecessary for evacuation. [619]\r\n\r\nA great many chest wounds and compound fractures were treated. The\r\nfractures were cleansed, injured tissue was removed, and a splint or\r\ncast applied. The biggest problem in fractures was the immobilization\r\nof the humerus. If the nerves could be readily found they were\r\nanchored. Plasma was extensively used, and whole blood, considered\r\nindispensable by the surgeons, was generally available. [620]\r\n\r\nIn the first days of the Leyte Campaign, because of the prelanding\r\nbombardment, more civilians than soldiers required treatment by\r\nmedical units. In the 7th Division sector for the first two days,\r\n75 percent of the medical facilities of the only clearing company in\r\noperation were used in caring for civilian casualties. On 24 October\r\nthe Army established a separate hospital on Leyte for civilians. [621]\r\n\r\nThe Sixth Army made a survey of 519 patients who died from injuries\r\nsuffered in battle. Of these 1 died of bayonet wounds, 2 of blast\r\nconcussion, 249 of gunshot wounds, 170 of fragment wounds, and\r\n97 of unclassified injuries, many of which were believed to have\r\nbeen inflicted by bomb or shell fragments. The location of the\r\ngunshot wounds was as follows: 66 in the abdomen, 21 in the back,\r\n7 in the buttocks, 67 in the chest, 49 in the head, 18 in the lower\r\nextremities, 9 in the upper extremities, 3 of multiple character,\r\nand 9 of unclassified location. Of the fragment wounds 25 were in\r\nthe abdomen, 7 in the back, 6 in the buttocks, 30 in the chest, 33 in\r\nthe head, 37 in the lower extremities, 11 in the upper extremities,\r\n12 multiple, and 9 unclassified. [622]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMedical Supply\r\n\r\nThe Sixth Army plan called for the assault troops to go in with five\r\ndays' medical supplies. The other units would go in with thirty days'\r\nsupply. The original plan provided for 300,000 troops over a sixty-day\r\nperiod only. Thereafter, it was expected that Sixth Army would depend\r\nupon resupply shipping and the diversion to Leyte of shipments intended\r\nto fill theater requirements of the Southwest Pacific area. The\r\nresupply shipping consisted of medical maintenance units. Since the\r\naverage medical maintenance unit contained less than 700 items as\r\ncompared to the 3,000 to 3,500 items eventually needed for a balanced\r\nsupply, the medical plan of the X Corps called for loading three days'\r\nsupply on their organic transports and on their personnel. The rest\r\nof the supplies were bulk loaded. The X Corps also had an emergency\r\nresupply of two medical maintenance units, one of which was never\r\nunloaded because of damage to the ship on which it was carried. [623]\r\n\r\nWhen the XXIV Corps was ordered to prepare for the Yap operation,\r\nthe 7th Division began to make its medical plans. After receiving\r\npermission to take a thirty-day supply for 22,000 men on its\r\nassault shipping, the division separated the stock into two sections,\r\nconsisting of a ten-day supply and a twenty-day supply. The former was\r\npacked in ten identical units with one unit to a pallet, each weighing\r\n1,840 pounds and having a volume of seventy-two cubic feet. One of\r\nthese units was allotted to each battalion of the division and one\r\nto the division headquarters. The twenty days' supply was packed in\r\nthree identical units, each weighing about 21,648 pounds and having\r\na volume of about 864 cubic feet. [624]\r\n\r\nThe 24th Division drew approximately thirty tons of medical supplies\r\nfrom the base medical supply. The division then mobile-loaded\r\ntwenty of these tons on five 2 1/2-ton trucks and assigned a truck\r\nto each collecting company. The remaining medical supplies were bulk\r\nloaded. Each medical unit also carried a five-day supply for immediate\r\nuse upon commitment. [625]\r\n\r\nWhen put into practice, however, this system of the 24th Division\r\nwas not entirely satisfactory. Because of the rapid advance of the\r\nassault troops and the lack of transportation, the system of supply\r\nbecame an acute problem. Resupply became co-ordinated with the chain\r\nof evacuation. Forward units would submit informal requisitions to the\r\nclearing companies at the second echelon of evacuation, whereupon the\r\nsupplies would be issued and brought forward by ambulances on their\r\nreturn to the front. The clearing companies would submit requisitions\r\nto the main dump. The difficulty of resupply can be appreciated when\r\nconsiderations of time and distance are understood. For instance,\r\nthe round trip from Carigara to Tacloban, where the main dump was\r\nlocated, amounted to about seventy miles. [626] As greater and greater\r\ndependence was placed upon human carriers to bring out the wounded\r\nand bring in supplies, it proved indeed fortunate that the Sixth Army\r\nhad established amicable relations with the Filipino civilians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCivil Affairs\r\n\r\nAlthough the United States Government had interested itself in\r\nthe civil affairs of the Philippines as early as 13 January 1944,\r\nit was not until 10 November, after the Leyte Campaign had been\r\nlaunched, that General MacArthur received his first directive on\r\ncivil affairs. Between the two dates strong disagreements developed\r\nbetween the War and Interior Departments as to who should administer\r\ncivil affairs in the Islands. The Interior Department insisted that\r\na civil representative of the High Commissioner of the Philippines\r\nshould accompany the assault troops, and General MacArthur was equally\r\ninsistent that he should not. The President finally resolved the\r\nquestion in favor of MacArthur. [627] Lacking a directive from the\r\nJoint Chiefs of Staff, General MacArthur devised his own policy for\r\ncivil affairs during the reoccupation of the Philippines.\r\n\r\nThe formulation of this policy may be said to have started on 22 July\r\n1944 with a memorandum from Brig. Gen. Bonner F. Fellers, personnel\r\nofficer of General Headquarters, to General MacArthur. He stated that\r\nalthough President Manuel Quezon had established a Division of Civil\r\nAffairs in the Philippine Army, the actual work would have to be done\r\nby the United States Army. General Fellers, therefore, recommended\r\nthat General Headquarters immediately assume full responsibility\r\nfor civil administration during the reoccupation. Administration\r\nin the occupied areas should be done, however, in the name of the\r\nPhilippine Commonwealth and in complete co-operation with its official\r\nrepresentatives. [628]\r\n\r\nOn 30 August General MacArthur issued a directive creating a civil\r\naffairs unit in his headquarters and outlining the broad policies\r\nthat were to be followed in the Philippines. [629] This directive\r\nwas subsequently expanded on 28 September [630] but it was not until\r\n9 October, eleven days before the landing on Leyte, that MacArthur\r\nissued detailed instructions on the procedures to be followed. [631]\r\n\r\nDuring the combat stage General Krueger, the senior tactical commander,\r\nwas to be responsible for such civil administration and relief as\r\nwould be possible under the existing tactical situation. General\r\nMacArthur would delegate the administration of civil affairs and\r\nrelief in the liberated areas as promptly as possible to the authorized\r\nrepresentatives of the Commonwealth Government. The only restrictions\r\nplaced upon the Filipino people were to be those required by military\r\nnecessity. By arrangement with General MacArthur the Philippine\r\nCommonwealth was, in general, to determine the guilt or innocence of\r\nsuspected collaborationists, though the U. S. Army commanders were\r\nto retain complete authority to deal with the suspects if necessary.\r\n\r\nGeneral MacArthur also established the financial policies to be\r\nfollowed. A new series of Philippine Treasury certificates called\r\n\"Victory Pesos\" would be introduced in the liberated areas. The\r\nexchange rate would be two for an American dollar. All prewar currency\r\nand all emergency currency officially determined to be bona fide would\r\nbe accepted at face value. All other Philippine or enemy currency would\r\nbe worthless. Wage rates to be paid Filipino labor were established\r\nand ceiling prices consistent with the approved wage scale were set.\r\n\r\nGeneral Krueger delegated authority for civil administration and relief\r\nto Generals Hodge and Sibert for their respective corps areas. The\r\ncommanding general of the Army Service Command was responsible for\r\nthe recruitment and maintenance of civilian labor. General MacArthur\r\nattached to the Sixth Army eight Philippine civil affairs units,\r\nwhich were to assist the field commanders in the administration of\r\ncivil affairs and relief. Two of these were retained by Sixth Army,\r\ntwo were attached to each of the corps, and two to the Army Service\r\nCommand. [632]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the conflict had passed by an area, a civil affairs\r\nunit of the Sixth Army stepped in and started to restore the normal\r\ncommunity life. Temporary appointments of Filipino officials were made,\r\nsuch appointments going to men who had been screened by the Counter\r\nIntelligence Corps or who were sponsored by Filipinos whose loyalty\r\nwas unquestioned. In nearly every case the Philippine Commonwealth\r\nratified these appointments. In every area reached by the Sixth Army,\r\ncivil officials were appointed as soon as the tide of battle passed,\r\nand without exception cordial relations were established. The civil\r\naffairs officers of the Sixth Army did not attempt to interfere with\r\ncivil operations unless requested to do so, or unless the military\r\nsituation made it necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRelations With Filipino Refugees\r\n\r\nWhile the American assault forces were hitting the shores of Leyte,\r\na delegation of Filipinos boarded the Blue Ridge and gave General\r\nIrving of the 24th Division information regarding conditions on the\r\nisland. They received a cordial welcome, the Filipino steward's mates\r\ngiving them much of their spare clothing. [633]\r\n\r\nMany refugees who had been driven from their homes by the naval\r\nbombardment came into the American lines on the beaches seeking\r\ncomfort and aid. These Filipinos had been without food or water for a\r\nconsiderable time, some of them for as long as twenty-four hours. Many\r\nof those who had remained in foxholes during the naval shelling were\r\nbadly shaken up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPalo Sector\r\n\r\nIn the area around Palo [634] fifty to seventy-five civilians had\r\narrived by nightfall on A Day, 20 October. The Army gave them food\r\nand drink and then quartered them in two houses on the beach. By\r\nthe following morning the influx of Filipinos had become very great\r\nand the arrival of many more was expected. The civil affairs officers\r\ntherefore secured two more dwellings, had latrines dug, and maintained\r\nconstant policing of the area, which was finally encircled by wire\r\nenclosures. The Army set up an evacuation hospital unit in the bivouac\r\narea to take care of the wounded and sick. A baby was delivered in\r\nan emergency obstetrical tent, \"both mother and child faring well.\"\r\n\r\nWells were dug to provide water for washing. During 21 October\r\nbetween 1,500 and 2,000 refugees crowded into the area. By 22\r\nOctober the congestion had become so great that a larger site was\r\nimperative. General Sibert decided to move the civilians to Palo,\r\neven though the town had not yet been cleared of Japanese. After\r\nan Army chaplain had said Mass, the refugees proceeded on foot,\r\nin single file, to Palo. The Army adopted this mode of advance in\r\norder to minimize interference with troops, supplies, and equipment\r\nand also to protect the refugees from mines and booby traps which\r\nthe Japanese had placed on the shoulders of the road. Many of the\r\ncivilians carried all of their effects with them; children, as young\r\nas three or four years, were impressed into carrying their share of\r\nthe family's meager possessions.\r\n\r\nBecause of the inpouring of refugees from surrounding districts,\r\nPalo suddenly grew from a normal population of about 6,000 to one\r\nestimated at 12,000 to 15,000. Nearly 5,000 people with their animals\r\ncrowded into a church and its adjacent compound. Sanitary conditions\r\nwere very bad.\r\n\r\nThe Army fed these refugees from captured stocks of rice and\r\nappointed a force of civilian police. After a survey of the area,\r\nthe Army instituted sanitary measures for cleaning up the church and\r\nits compound, with removal and burial of the dead animals. Civilian\r\nlaborers who had been checked for their loyalty undertook the burial\r\nof American and Japanese dead and the unloading of ships in the\r\nharbor. The Army disarmed all Filipinos except guerrillas and enforced\r\nsecurity regulations, which prohibited civilians from appearing on\r\nthe streets after dark. As more military units entered the town,\r\n5,000 of the refugees were moved to its outskirts. The Army set up\r\na hospital in the compound and surgeries in the schoolhouses, with\r\nseparate wards for men and women. Teachers and other qualified women\r\nassisted as practical nurses. Within one week the Army had organized\r\nthe town and begun work toward rehabilitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDulag Sector\r\n\r\nOn the beaches of XXIV Corps a naval civil affairs unit controlled\r\nthe Philippine civilians. [635] This unit arrived ashore at 0700 on 21\r\nOctober. The area which had been previously allocated for a civilian\r\ncompound was found to be a swamp. Approximately 1,500 refugees were\r\nscattered around the landing beaches. The Army assembled these and\r\nmoved them to a new site in the town of Dulag, but the location\r\nhad undergone a three-day naval bombardment which had reduced it to\r\nsmoldering rubble. The Army recruited laborers to clean the area.\r\n\r\nThe military police assisted in control of the civilian population\r\nand procured and distributed food and water. A medical officer and\r\nseveral enlisted men from the 7th Division gave medical aid to large\r\nnumbers of civilians who were treated for minor wounds, injuries,\r\ntropical ulcers, and other ailments. By 22 October the medical officer\r\nhad referred at least 100 of the more serious cases to an Army field\r\nhospital near by. Fifteen unclaimed and unidentified civilian dead\r\nwere buried in the Filipino cemetery.\r\n\r\nBy the morning of 22 October, since the civilian population of Dulag\r\nhad grown to approximately 10,000, General Hodge issued orders to move\r\nthe refugees to a new location. By 23 October, when a suitable place\r\nhad been found, the number of refugees had risen to approximately\r\n30,000. The mass migration to the new location, which was two miles\r\nfrom Dulag, was most difficult, and not until the civil affairs\r\nofficers had sent food and water to the new site could civilians\r\nbe persuaded to move. The selected area measured about 1,000 by 600\r\nyards and consisted of a coconut grove and a beach. Except for its\r\ninadequate size and its infringement upon military installations,\r\nit was completely satisfactory. After 24 October the civilians were\r\nremoved from camp and sent back to their home villages as soon as\r\nthe latter were declared secure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIssuing of Supplies\r\n\r\nBy the morning of 24 October the Sixth Army was taking care of\r\nsome 45,000 people, most of the population of about fifty-six\r\ncommunities. Although at first there was a shortage of food and water,\r\nby 24 October there was an adequate supply. Before that time the\r\nArmy supplied the civilians with C and K rations, since it could not\r\nlocate an appreciable quantity of the civilian food supplies. Seventy\r\npercent of these supplies, consisting of fish, rice, and meat, were\r\nlater found and distributed by the civil affairs officers.\r\n\r\nThe Army originally distributed food to individuals but later made\r\ndistribution through leaders in the barrios until it could establish\r\na general store. The civil affairs officers distributed 28,700 full\r\nrations, fifty cases of condensed milk for infant use, and five tons\r\nof captured Japanese rice. About 5,000 full rations were stolen or\r\nnot accounted for. An Army purification unit set up a 3,000-gallon\r\ncanvas water tank and furnished water to the area.\r\n\r\nA general store was in operation by 26 October for the sale of\r\nnecessities. Clothing, rice, biscuits, salmon, and candles were the\r\nitems most in demand. Some articles were ill adapted to the use or\r\ncustoms of the Filipinos. \"The people would not buy or use the 4,000\r\nrat traps or the rolls of toilet paper furnished nor would they buy or\r\nuse canned or powdered milk.\" [636] Prices were fixed at prewar levels.\r\n\r\nThe civil affairs units of the Sixth Army opened about 500 schools in\r\nthe principal barrios, those in Tacloban being the first to open. Many\r\nschool buildings were either rebuilt or repaired under the direction of\r\ncivil affairs officers and with funds furnished by them. Since there\r\nwere no primary textbooks, in one instance the civil affairs units\r\nmimeographed a series of three schoolbooks which were illustrated\r\nby an Army artist. The teachers of Leyte not only provided excellent\r\nservice in school work but also acted as relief workers, sanitarians,\r\nand assistants in the dispensaries and hospitals.\r\n\r\nAt first, a number of improvised hospitals were opened up. When the\r\ncivilian hospital supplies arrived, however, modern hospitals were\r\nestablished at Tacloban, Baybay, and Carigara. These were staffed\r\nby local doctors and nurses, but the civil affairs unit continued to\r\nfurnish food and supervision. Twenty-seven permanent dispensaries were\r\nalso established. These were greatly needed, since the Japanese had not\r\ngiven the people any medical aid and had stopped all preventive medical\r\nmeasures. Dental treatment was given to more than 2,000 Filipinos,\r\nand smallpox inoculations were administered to more than 8,000. Also,\r\nwhen they seemed to be required, inoculations were given for typhoid,\r\ntyphus, and cholera.\r\n\r\nThe prescribed amount of civilian medical supplies proved to be\r\ninadequate, a situation which placed an undue burden upon the medical\r\nunits and facilities of all echelons of the Sixth Army. The food\r\nsupplies, however, were more than adequate. The sizes of clothing and\r\nshoes were often too large and there was not a sufficient supply of\r\nwomen's and children's garments. On the island 10,000 tons of civilian\r\nsupplies were landed, of which 6,830 tons were distributed. About\r\n1,102 tons of rice were sold or given away, a figure which does not\r\ninclude captured Japanese stocks of rice. More than 400,000 refugees\r\nwere fed and 287,000 relief clients were cared for. [637] By 25\r\nDecember the relief rolls included only the aged, sick, and infirm,\r\nand members of families without a breadwinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecruitment of Filipinos\r\n\r\n\"Hundreds of self appointed guerrillas whose only claim to\r\nparticipation in the guerrilla organization was a recently realized\r\nambition to be of service to their country and to their allies\"\r\nconfronted the assault forces on the beachheads. These individuals\r\ncaused endless confusion, since it was practically impossible for\r\nthe Americans to distinguish between the genuine guerrilla and\r\nhis opportunistic counterfeit. After the first few days, however,\r\nthe Army made contact with guerrilla headquarters and established\r\nliaison with the bona fide guerrillas. [638]\r\n\r\nGeneral Krueger made the guerrillas a part of his armed forces, and\r\nthey became a source of additional strength to the Sixth Army. These\r\nmen frequently operated and patrolled in enemy-held territory and\r\nbrought the Americans valuable information on Japanese movements and\r\ndispositions; the unit commanders of Sixth Army, however, tended to\r\ndiscount reports from such sources with regard to the size of Japanese\r\nforces. The guerrillas also guarded supply dumps and depots, bridges,\r\nand other installations in the rear areas.\r\n\r\nThe generosity of the American soldier in giving away supplies\r\nmade it difficult to recruit civilian labor. Since gifts of food to\r\nprospective laborers diminished their incentive to work, the Sixth\r\nArmy issued an order prohibiting such gifts. As early as 21 October\r\nthe Army got in touch with political and labor leaders to serve as\r\nadvisers and assistants, telling them from day to day how many laborers\r\nwould be needed. The Filipino leaders were very co-operative and made\r\narrangements to secure the necessary labor. Good results were obtained\r\nby enlisting the support of local leaders, especially the parish\r\npriests. General Krueger declared: \"In all reported instances, the\r\npriests lent willing assistance and their information on individuals\r\nand conditions was found reliable and outstandingly impartial.\" [639]\r\nAs the fighting reached past Carigara and Dagami and into the central\r\nmountain range the Filipinos acted as supply carriers for the troops\r\nand worked on the roads and trails. At one time there were as many as\r\n8,000 Filipinos engaged in this labor. Army furnished transportation\r\nto the site of the work and paid wages according to the Commonwealth\r\nGovernment wage scales.\r\n\r\nThroughout November the logistical situation on Leyte remained\r\nbad. Work on roads, together with that on airfields and other\r\ninstallations, consisted largely of temporary expedients. The\r\ndifficult problem of getting supplies ashore and to the troops had\r\nnot been completely solved, a situation which hampered the progress\r\nof the tactical troops. The lag in construction of airdromes made\r\nit impossible for land-based air forces to give adequate close air\r\nsupport to the ground forces. This lack of support was another handicap\r\nto General Krueger's men as they fought their way into the mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nThe Mountain Barrier: Part One\r\n\r\n\r\nThe successful completion of the campaign for the entire Leyte Valley\r\non 2 November enabled General Krueger to embark on the next phase of\r\nhis plan for the liberation of Leyte.\r\n\r\nThis action was to consist of two drives converging on Ormoc: one\r\nsouth through Ormoc Valley by X Corps and the other north from Baybay\r\nby XXIV Corps. The remaining Japanese on the island would thus be\r\nforced into the mountains west of Ormoc Valley where they could not\r\noffer effective organized resistance. At first, while some elements\r\nof the XXIV Corps continued to push west to reinforce the troops on\r\nthe shores of Ormoc Bay and mopped up in southern Leyte Valley, the X\r\nCorps was to secure control of the coast of Carigara Bay from Carigara\r\nto Pinamopoan. With the completion of this assignment, the northern\r\nelements of the Sixth Army would be in a position to drive south along\r\nHighway 2 which twisted and turned through the northern mountains\r\nand central plains of Ormoc Valley to the port of Ormoc. [640] (Map 13)\r\n\r\nGeneral Sibert ordered elements of the 1st Cavalry Division to occupy\r\nCarigara while the 24th Division secured the coastal corridor that\r\nran from Carigara to Pinamopoan and then drove south along Highway\r\n2 and occupied Ormoc. A battalion from the 24th Division was to move\r\nto the Jaro area and protect the 155-mm. howitzers of the 947th Field\r\nArtillery Battalion which was to assist the advance south by covering\r\na trail that ran from Jaro to Ormoc. [641]\r\n\r\nSince the 21st Infantry had encountered virtually no opposition in\r\nthe vicinity of Panaon Strait and since it was desirable that the\r\nregiment rejoin the 24th Division, General Krueger on 30 October had\r\ndirected General Hodge to relieve the 21st Infantry with one battalion\r\nof the 32d Infantry. [642] General Irving ordered the 34th Infantry to\r\ncontinue its attack and secure Capoocan. When the town was captured\r\nthe 19th Infantry was to move into it on 4 November while the 34th\r\nInfantry continued the drive west and secured Pinamopoan. [643]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Coastal Corridor\r\n\r\nCapoocan and Pinamopoan\r\n\r\nAt 0700 on 3 November the 34th Infantry moved west from its perimeter\r\nat Balaud in a column of battalions, with the 1st Battalion, under\r\nColonel Clifford, in the lead. The 1st Battalion entered Capoocan at\r\n0755 and within ten minutes had secured the town. [644]\r\n\r\nAt 0830 the battalion moved out and continued west along the coastal\r\nroad to Pinamopoan. After an advance of about 1,000 yards, Company B,\r\nthe point, encountered an enemy force, estimated at about 100 men,\r\nentrenched on the west bank of a stream. The column halted and placed\r\nmortar fire on the Japanese but failed to dislodge them. The company\r\nthen withdrew while the howitzers of the 63d Field Artillery Battalion\r\npounded the enemy position.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime a platoon of Company B moved south to secure a ridge\r\nwhich paralleled the road. When the platoon located some Japanese\r\ndug in on the reverse slope Colonel Clifford sent Company A to its\r\nassistance. The guides took Company A over the wrong trail and the\r\ntroops ran into the strong enemy entrenchments well concealed by\r\nunderbrush on the western bank of the stream. Company A launched\r\na frontal assault, but after the first platoon had passed the\r\nhidden positions the Japanese opened fire and forced the company\r\nto withdraw. Colonel Clifford rushed Company C to the assistance of\r\nCompany A, ordering it to deploy around the left flank of Company A\r\nand onto the next ridge. The platoon from Company B returned to its\r\nmorning position.\r\n\r\nCompanies A and C then started against the Japanese emplacements on the\r\nopposite bank of the stream. [645] The leader of the advance squad of\r\nCompany A was killed and Sgt. Charles E. Mower assumed command. As he\r\nstarted to lead his men across the stream, Sergeant Mower was severely\r\nwounded. From his exposed position in the middle of the stream he\r\ndirected his squad in the destruction of two enemy machine guns and\r\nnumerous riflemen, but he was killed when the Japanese turned their\r\nfire against him. Sergeant Mower was posthumously awarded the Medal\r\nof Honor.\r\n\r\nAt 1530 Colonel Clifford withdrew Company A. After the 63d Field\r\nArtillery Battalion had blasted the ridge parallel to the road,\r\nCompany B attacked, while Company C made its envelopment around the\r\nsouth flank and destroyed the Japanese pocket of resistance. At 1800\r\nthe 1st Battalion formed its night perimeter. [646]\r\n\r\nEarlier, at 1430, Company K had made a reconnaissance in amphibian\r\ntractors from Capoocan to a point just west of Pinamopoan. Since it\r\nencountered heavy enemy fire, the company withdrew and returned to\r\nCapoocan. [647]\r\n\r\nDuring the night the 11th and 63d Field Artillery Battalions massed\r\ntheir fires and laid interdiction fire up and down the highway. Under\r\ncover of darkness, the Japanese force opposing the 1st Battalion\r\nwithdrew. On the following morning patrols sent out by the 1st\r\nBattalion scouted 1,000 yards to the front but encountered no\r\nenemy. The battalion therefore moved out at 0730 to Colasian where\r\nit set up a defensive position. The 2d and 3d Battalions then passed\r\nthrough the 1st. The 2d Battalion entered Pinamopoan and dug in, while\r\nthe 3d passed through the town and continued west along the highway\r\n1,700 yards. There it set up a defensive position just short of a ridge\r\nof hills that was later to be known as Breakneck Ridge. [648] Between\r\nCapoocan and Pinamopoan the Japanese had abandoned three 75-mm.,\r\none 40-mm., and five 37-mm. guns, together with ammunition dumps,\r\nsignal equipment, and many documents. The 34th Infantry found some land\r\nmines on the road and destroyed them. Since the regiment had quickly\r\nsecured the coastal corridor and had started to move down Highway 2,\r\nthe X Corps was now in a position from which it could drive south.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefense of the Coastal Corridor\r\n\r\nSome elements of the 26th Division had arrived on Leyte during the\r\nnaval battle, and on 1 November most of the 1st Division and the\r\n12th Independent Infantry Regiment of the 26th Division landed\r\nat Ormoc. The 1st Division, which had been activated in Tokyo,\r\nhad served in Manchuria during the \"China Incident\" and had been\r\ntransferred to Shanghai in August 1944. Though it had no combat\r\nexperience, this division was considered by General Tomochika to be\r\nthe best equipped division of the Japanese Army. Under the command\r\nof Lt. Gen. Tadasu Kataoka, it had been held in reserve by Imperial\r\nGeneral Headquarters for the decisive battle, and it was sent to\r\nManila with great expectations. [649]\r\n\r\nThe arrival of these troops was in accord with a plan devised after the\r\nBattle of Leyte Gulf. The 102d Division, coming from Panay, and the 1st\r\nand 26th Divisions, sailing from Luzon, were to land at Ormoc. General\r\nSuzuki planned to have these troops move north along the Ormoc-Limon\r\nroad (Highway 2) through Ormoc Valley, from which they were to diverge\r\nin three columns and capture the Carigara-Jaro road. After seizing\r\nthe road, the Japanese troops were to advance east and destroy the\r\nAmerican forces in the area between Tacloban and Tanauan. After the\r\n1st Division had secured Carigara, the 68th Brigade was to land in the\r\nnorth as 35th Army reserve. At the same time the 30th Division was\r\nto land at Albuera on Ormoc Bay and advance over mountainous trails\r\nto Burauen and later neutralize all resistance in the Dulag area. [650]\r\n\r\nWhen General Suzuki received information that the Americans had secured\r\nCarigara, he realized that it would be impossible to drive toward\r\nSan Pedro Bay with the Americans on his left flank. He believed,\r\nhowever, that the reinforced 1st Division could easily wipe out the\r\nAmerican forces in the Carigara area. On 3 November he ordered the\r\n1st Division to speed up its passage through Ormoc Valley and the 102d\r\nDivision to consolidate its forces with those of the 1st Division for\r\nan all-out attack to annihilate the American troops near Carigara. The\r\n26th Division was to advance on Jaro. [651] No alternative to this\r\nplan had been prepared in case the projected operations were not\r\nsuccessful. [652] On 3 November, American aircraft struck at the\r\n1st Division as it moved up Ormoc Valley in a ten-mile-long convoy\r\nof trucks, tanks, and artillery. They destroyed about thirty trucks\r\nand left two tanks burning. The aircraft received heavy and accurate\r\nground antiaircraft fire, and two of the planes were shot down by\r\nthe Japanese. [653]\r\n\r\nThe lack of defense at Carigara had come as a surprise to General\r\nKrueger, since the Americans had observed the Japanese reinforcing\r\nthe area. General Suzuki had cleverly concealed from the Americans his\r\nstrength and intentions and thus had gained time for a withdrawal by a\r\n\"very successful\" delaying action. [654] At the same time, the 57th\r\nInfantry Regiment of the 1st Division had been able to move north\r\nthrough Ormoc Valley and establish itself in the northern mountains\r\nsurrounding Highway 2.\r\n\r\nThe bringing in of reinforcements by the Japanese brought into sharp\r\nfocus the lack of American aerial strength on Leyte. Although the Fifth\r\nAir Force had numerous aircraft in the rear areas, these could not be\r\nbrought forward because of the very poor condition of the available\r\nairstrips. The few aircraft based on Leyte could not prevent the flow\r\nof additional enemy forces into the island or give direct support to\r\nthe ground troops of Sixth Army.\r\n\r\nSince the Japanese had been able to send without difficulty about\r\n13,500 troops into the Ormoc area, General Krueger recognized that\r\nthey were capable also of landing troops on the shores of Carigara\r\nBay. This landing, if successful, would isolate the American forces\r\nin the Carigara area. To meet this threat, several courses of action\r\nwere open to General Krueger: he could devote the full energy of the\r\nX Corps to preparing a defense against a sea force attack; he could\r\ndisregard the threat and have the X Corps push vigorously south and\r\nsecure a position on ground south of Limon, which was about two and a\r\nhalf miles southwest of Pinamopoan, before the Japanese could build\r\ndefensive positions; or, finally, he could advance south with some\r\nelements, leaving others to guard the Carigara area.\r\n\r\nIf the Japanese Navy and amphibious assault forces entered Carigara\r\nBay, the possibilities for effective countermeasures were not very\r\npromising. The escort carriers of the Seventh Fleet, greatly weakened\r\nby the Battle of Leyte Gulf, could not give support, and it was quite\r\npossible that any assistance that could be furnished by the Third\r\nFleet might not arrive in time.\r\n\r\nRanking officers of the Seventh Fleet, however, did not believe it\r\nlikely that the Japanese would launch an amphibious assault through\r\nCarigara Bay. The reasons given were as follows: The Japanese had\r\nnever made an assault landing against defended beaches in the past;\r\nthey were short of equipment to make a sustained amphibious assault;\r\nand they would be landing in the face of the combined fire of the X\r\nCorps artillery which would cover the beachhead area from positions\r\nwell behind the beaches. [655]\r\n\r\nAlthough General Krueger realized that the high ground in the\r\nLimon area was the key to operations farther south, he decided that\r\nthe threat to the Carigara area could not be ignored. Since he had\r\ninsufficient forces to drive south and at the same time to prepare the\r\nCarigara area for defense, on 4 November he directed General Sibert to\r\nprotect the Carigara area from a seaborne attack before the advance\r\nto the south was continued. At the same time the X Corps was to send\r\nout units to explore for trails that led from Daro, about three miles\r\nsouthwest of Jaro, to Ormoc with the view of emplacing an artillery\r\nbattalion of 155-mm. guns within effective firing range of Ormoc. [656]\r\n\r\nGeneral Sibert immediately told General Irving to defer until\r\nfurther orders the advance south by the 24th Division. At the\r\nsame time he directed Generals Irving and Mudge to have their\r\ndivisions prepare defenses to ward off a seaborne attack against the\r\nBarugo-Carigara-Capoocan area. Patrols of the 24th Infantry Division\r\nand the 1st Cavalry Division were to maintain contact at the Carigara\r\nRiver. [657]\r\n\r\nGeneral Mudge thereupon ordered the 1st Cavalry Brigade to patrol the\r\nCarigara-Jaro road and to protect the movement of supplies and troops\r\nalong the road. The 2d Cavalry Brigade was to establish two squadrons\r\nin the Carigara-Barugo area to protect the seaward approaches to the\r\narea, guard the bridge between Barugo and Carigara, and maintain the\r\nsecurity of San Juanico Strait. The brigade was to be prepared to\r\nreinforce the 24th Division. [658]\r\n\r\nGeneral Irving, also, redisposed his forces. All the field artillery\r\nbattalions had been at Carigara but, with the issuance of the order to\r\nprotect the coast of Carigara Bay, the 13th and 52d Field Artillery\r\nBattalions moved to Colasion Point on 4 November, while the 63d and\r\n11th took positions east and west of Capoocan. [659]\r\n\r\nOn 5 November General Sibert returned the 21st Infantry to the 24th\r\nDivision and recommended that General Irving send the regiment to\r\nPinamopoan to relieve the battle-weary 34th Infantry. [660] By the\r\nend of the day the 1st and 3d Battalions, 21st Infantry, had relieved\r\nthe 34th Infantry and were on the edge of Breakneck Ridge west of\r\nPinamopoan. [661]\r\n\r\nThe American aircraft made two strikes at the convoy of the 1st\r\nDivision as it moved north up Highway 2. The first one at about 1430\r\ndestroyed about thirty trucks, several tanks, and an ammunition dump\r\nand killed fifty to seventy-five men and thirty to forty horses. The\r\nsecond strike at about 1745 hit trucks loaded with Japanese soldiers\r\nwho scattered when attacked. All the vehicles were camouflaged with\r\npalm leaves. [662]\r\n\r\nBy 6 November, since the X Corps had disposed its force to protect\r\nthe seaward approaches and since the Navy had given assurance that an\r\namphibious assault was unlikely, General Krueger felt that the attack\r\nsouth could be continued. He was anxious to have the Sixth Army drive\r\nrapidly down Highway 2 and secure the port of Ormoc, through which the\r\nJapanese had reinforced the Leyte garrison. He also wished to guard\r\nagainst the possibility that the Japanese, as more and more of their\r\ntroops moved up Ormoc Valley, would attempt to debouch into northern\r\nLeyte Valley. He therefore directed General Sibert to expend his main\r\neffort in the drive south but also to send elements of his force\r\ninto the mountains east of Ormoc Valley. These units were to seize\r\nthe mountain passes and secure positions in the Daro area from which\r\nthe artillery could deliver long-range fire upon Ormoc in support of\r\nthe advance south. At the same time, elements of the XXIV Corps were\r\nto guard the mountain passages into southern Leyte Valley. [663]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBattle of Breakneck Ridge\r\n\r\nThe Battle Begins\r\n\r\nOn 5 November General Sibert instructed the 24th Division to complete\r\nthe relief of the 34th Infantry and at the same time to push strong,\r\naggressive patrols to the south. The 1st Battalion, 19th Infantry,\r\nwas to protect a battalion of 155-mm. guns, which was to deliver\r\nlong-range fire on Ormoc, about fourteen miles to the southwest. The\r\nattack south was to begin on 7 November. [664]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, General Irving ordered the 21st Infantry, after\r\nthe completion of its relief of the 34th Infantry, to reconnoiter\r\nBreakneck Ridge to its front on 6 November and on the following day\r\nto launch its drive south. A battalion of the 19th Infantry was to\r\nmove to Pinamopoan and protect the line of communications of the 21st\r\nInfantry as the attack progressed. The rest of the 19th Infantry was\r\nto move to the mountains in the vicinity of Daro and Jaro to protect\r\nthe 226th Field Artillery Battalion and secure the mountain passes\r\nthat led into Leyte Valley. [665]\r\n\r\nThe 21st Infantry relieved the 34th Infantry in the vicinity of\r\nPinamopoan without difficulty and sent out strong patrols to Breakneck\r\nRidge. One of these patrols was led by Lt. Col. Frederick R. Weber,\r\nthe regimental commander.\r\n\r\nBreakneck Ridge, over which Highway 2 corkscrewed its way between\r\nPinamopoan and Limon for about 7,200 yards, was actually a hill mass\r\nwith many spurs branching off from an irregularly shaped crest line\r\ntoward the shores of Carigara Bay to the north and the Leyte River\r\nvalley to the south. Shoulder-high cogon grass was thick on the low\r\nground, and the pockets between the hills were heavily forested. The\r\nvalleys were deep, with precipitous sides. The 1st Division had heavily\r\nfortified the area, taking advantage of the innumerable thickly wooded\r\npockets that served as natural forts. The Japanese had also built an\r\nelaborate system of trenches and other defensive positions and had\r\nhoneycombed the area with spider holes. Many of the latter were on\r\nreverse slopes some distance below the crests and were protected from\r\ndirect fire. In front of each spider hole the enemy had cut fire lanes\r\nthrough the cogon grass, which was left so short that even a crawling\r\nsoldier would be exposed to fire. The constant rainfall made the hills\r\nslippery and treacherous, and, more important, provided a protective\r\ncurtain in the day and covered movements of the enemy at night. [666]\r\n\r\nOn 5 November, before the relief of the 34th Infantry, Maj. Kemuel\r\nK. Blacker, leading an artillery forward observer's party from the 52d\r\nField Artillery Battalion and a patrol from the 34th Infantry, had\r\nreconnoitered far forward on Breakneck Ridge to the top of a knoll,\r\nlater called OP Hill, which was some 2,500 yards west of Pinamopoan,\r\nand was directing fire from that point. [667] The party was attacked\r\nby a group of about platoon strength from the 57th Infantry Regiment\r\nand took refuge in an abandoned position. At 1230 Colonel Weber\r\nordered the 3d Battalion, 21st Infantry, to move out to the party's\r\nassistance. Company K, on the right side of the highway, was able to\r\nsecure the northern approaches to the hill and rescue the observation\r\nparty, though it ran into heavy machine gun and rifle fire. In the\r\nmeantime Company I moved to the left and against stiff resistance\r\nsecured a ridge later known as Corkscrew Ridge, which was about 1,200\r\nyards southeast of OP Hill and which formed the southeastern spur of\r\nBreakneck Ridge. Since both companies needed more ammunition, vehicles\r\nwith the required supply were sent up along the road. After hidden\r\nJapanese riflemen had punctured the tires, the vehicles withdrew and\r\nthe ammunition was carried up by hand. A platoon of riflemen from\r\nCompany I cleared out the enemy position but received mortar fire\r\nfrom an unknown source. [668]\r\n\r\nBoth companies were so far in advance of the rest of the 21st\r\nInfantry that only limited supplies of ammunition and rations could\r\nreach them. As the afternoon hours wore on, the pressure from the\r\n57th Infantry increased but the companies dug in and held their\r\npositions. During the night they repulsed three counterattacks of about\r\nfifty men each. [669] On the following morning the 57th Infantry placed\r\nmortar fire upon the companies, [670] augmented at first by fire from\r\none artillery piece and later by fire from a four-gun battery. [671]\r\nThe intensity of this fire forced the companies to withdraw from\r\ntheir position and rejoin the rest of the 3d Battalion on the beach\r\nnear Colasion. [672]\r\n\r\nDuring the day the 1st Battalion tried unsuccessfully to secure\r\npositions to support the attack through Breakneck Ridge. At the\r\nclose of 6 November the 57th Infantry of the 1st Division securely\r\noccupied Breakneck Ridge and its northern approaches. For the assault\r\nthe following day, General Irving attached the 3d Battalion, 19th\r\nInfantry, to the 21st Infantry. The 3d Battalion, 21st Infantry, had\r\nreorganized about 2,000 yards east of Pinamopoan. The 1st Battalion was\r\non the regiment's right, the 2d Battalion was in the center astride\r\nthe highway, and the 3d Battalion, 19th Infantry, was on the 21st\r\nInfantry's left. [673]\r\n\r\nThe 2d Battalion, 21st Infantry, was the object of a night attack that\r\nstarted at 2000 and lasted for two hours. The enemy used mortars\r\nand grenades against the battalion but was unable to penetrate\r\nits perimeter. [674] Colonel Weber ordered the 21st Infantry to be\r\nprepared to move out at 0800 on 7 November. The assault was to be\r\nmade in column of battalions, the 2d Battalion in the lead, with\r\na spur of Breakneck Ridge as the initial objective. This spur or\r\nbranch ridge extended east and west across the road 400 yards south\r\nof the front line. General Irving ordered the 52d Field Artillery\r\nBattalion to mass its fire immediately in front of the troops for\r\nfifteen minutes just before they jumped off and then to shift its\r\nfire to the ridge. Attached to the 2d Battalion for support were a\r\nplatoon from the 44th Tank Company, a company from the 85th Chemical\r\nBattalion, and a company from the 632d Tank Destroyer Battalion. [675]\r\n\r\nAt 0940 the 308th Bombardment Wing bombed the headquarters of General\r\nSuzuki at Ormoc and strafed the highway near by. Ormoc had also been\r\nunder constant fire from the battalion of 155-mm. guns in Jaro, at\r\na range of 25,000 yards. Only a few houses were left standing after\r\nthe bombardment was completed. [676]\r\n\r\nThe troops moved out as scheduled. Company E, on the west of the\r\nroad, reached the branch ridge at 0915 and came under fire from\r\nenemy automatic weapons on the right. Company G ran into about 200\r\nmen from the 3d Battalion, 57th Infantry Regiment. They were well\r\nentrenched at a bend of the road on the forward slope of the high\r\nground, and Colonel Weber had the self-propelled guns of the tank\r\ndestroyer battalion brought forward. These fired into the pocket, and\r\nalthough they killed the commander of the 3d Battalion the unit held\r\nfast. [677] Weber then called two tanks forward, but as they moved\r\nalong the road a Japanese soldier jumped out of the high cogon grass\r\nand disabled one of the tanks by planting a magnetic mine against\r\nit. The other tank then withdrew. [678]\r\n\r\nGeneral Sibert was dissatisfied with the progress of the 21st\r\nInfantry and felt that Colonel Weber was not sufficiently\r\naggressive. Accompanied by his G-2, Col. William J. Verbeck, he\r\nvisited the command post of Colonel Weber at noon. Dispensing with\r\nthe usual command channels and in the presence of General Irving,\r\nhe relieved Colonel Weber and made Colonel Verbeck the commanding\r\nofficer of the 21st Infantry. Colonel Weber was retained in the\r\nregiment as its executive officer. [679]\r\n\r\nColonel Verbeck ordered Company L, in support of the 2d Battalion,\r\nto make a wide flanking movement to the east and secure the ridge\r\nwhich had been denied to Company G. The company moved out at 1630\r\nbut was unsuccessful. As it withdrew it made contact with Company F\r\nwhich had successfully pushed forward but because of an unexplained\r\nmisunderstanding of orders had withdrawn. [680] Night perimeters were\r\nestablished on the edge of Breakneck Ridge.\r\n\r\nOn the same day Colonel Chapman, commander of the 19th Infantry,\r\nordered his 2d Battalion to send a reinforced rifle company to Hill\r\n1525 about 2,600 yards southeast of Limon, seize this ground, and,\r\nin support of the advance south by the 21st Infantry, direct artillery\r\nfire on Highway 2. Company G, 19th Infantry, moved out on this mission\r\nwith only two thirds of a ration per man, since its kitchens were\r\nstill in the Jaro area. The guides with Company G lost their way,\r\nand the company set up a night perimeter after a patrol had located\r\na strong enemy position on a ridge west of its course. The company\r\nposition was thought to be in the vicinity of Hill 1525, but it was\r\nactually far east of the hill. [681]\r\n\r\nAs the 2d Battalion, 21st Infantry, had failed to secure the ridge 400\r\nyards to its front, Colonel Verbeck that night ordered the battalion,\r\nwith Company L attached, to continue the attack toward the ridge after\r\nan artillery barrage on the following morning. The 1st Battalion\r\nwas to secure Hill 1525, establish contact with the 2d Battalion,\r\n19th Infantry, and from the hill envelop the southern flank of the\r\n1st Division. [682]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of 8 November a typhoon, moving in from the west, swept\r\nover the entire island. Jan Valtin, a member of the 24th Division,\r\ngraphically describes it: \"From the angry immensity of the heavens\r\nfloods raced in almost horizontal sheets. Palms bent low under the\r\nstorm, their fronds flattened like streamers of wet silk. Trees\r\ncrashed to earth. In the expanse of ... [cogon] grass the howling of\r\nthe wind was like a thousand-fold plaint of the unburied dead. The\r\ntrickle of supplies was at a standstill. On Carigara Bay the obscured\r\nheadlands moaned under the onslaught of the ... seas. Planes were\r\ngrounded and ships became haunted things looking for refuge. Massed\r\nartillery ... barrages to the summit of Breakneck Ridge sounded dim\r\nand hollow in the tempest. Trails were obliterated by the rain. The\r\nsky was black.\" [683] In the midst of the storm, the infantry attacked.\r\n\r\nThe 2d Battalion, 21st Infantry, effectively used flame throwers\r\nto drive the enemy troops out of spider holes and caves. [684]\r\nAlthough shelled by sporadic artillery fire, the battalion continued\r\nto advance. Strong elements of the 57th Infantry hotly contested the\r\nAmerican assault. Meanwhile Company E pushed farther along the road\r\nuntil it was halted at the site of a bridge which had been destroyed\r\nby the enemy. The Japanese had flanked the site with emplacements\r\nfrom which rifle, automatic weapons, and mortar fire resisted the\r\nfrontal attack of the company. [685] At nightfall Company E fell\r\nback to its morning position. The 57th Infantry continued to make a\r\ndetermined stand against the 2d Battalion. Concealed Japanese riflemen\r\nfired continuously on the front, flanks, and rear of all positions and\r\nsmall enemy detachments infiltrated through the lines. In concert with\r\nthe attack of the 2d Battalion, the 1st Battalion had moved out that\r\nmorning toward Hill 1525. Since the maps were grossly inaccurate, the\r\nprecise location of the hill was unknown, but the battalion reported\r\nthat it had reached the southern slope of the hill at 1600 and was\r\ndigging in under automatic weapons fire. At 0700 the 2d Battalion,\r\n19th Infantry, under Colonel Spragins, moved out through a driving rain\r\nand over precipitous trails to join the battalion's Company G. During\r\nthe day Company G drove the enemy off the ridge where the company's\r\nadvance had been halted the previous afternoon. In their flight the\r\nJapanese abandoned much equipment, most of which was new. Of more\r\nimportance, a significant field order of the 1st Division was found\r\non the body of a Japanese officer.\r\n\r\nWhen the consolidation of the battalion was made, Colonel Spragins\r\ndetermined that he was east of Hill 1525 as shown on the maps. Although\r\nthe battalion was in a position to observe Leyte Valley, it would\r\nhave to move westward in order to get a view of Ormoc Valley. At 1530\r\nColonel Spragins therefore sent Company E to occupy a ridge 1,000\r\nyards to the west. The battalion then dug in for the night. [686]\r\nOn the following morning General Irving placed the battalion under\r\nthe operational control of the 21st Infantry.\r\n\r\nImmediately in front of the 21st Infantry was a Japanese force\r\nestimated to be of battalion strength. To the east was an undetermined\r\nnumber of enemy machine guns. In front of Company E a bridge was out\r\nand tanks could not pass. On the steep sides of the gulch around this\r\nbridge site, elements of the 57th Infantry with rifles, automatic\r\nweapons, and mortars stopped all attempts of Company E to move\r\nforward. [687]\r\n\r\nThrough the night torrential rains fell. At dawn of 9 November two\r\nbegrimed, soaked, and weary battalions of the 21st Infantry jumped off\r\nto the attack, the 2d Battalion, less Company F, on the west side of\r\nthe road and the 3d Battalion on the east. Heavy artillery preparations\r\nhad already pounded the Japanese front lines. As the attack progressed,\r\nmortars and artillery placed fires on targets of opportunity. In\r\ndestroying pockets of resistance in the gulch, grenades, rifles,\r\nand flame throwers were used, together with heavy machine guns.\r\n\r\nAt 0930 Company I, 21st Infantry, reached the crest of the intermediate\r\nridge on the east side of the road which ran southward toward the\r\ncenter of Breakneck Ridge. An hour later Company E, 21st Infantry,\r\nmoved out from the perimeter it had held for two days. Its mission\r\nwas to cut west of the road and secure the commanding high ground in\r\nthe rear of the emplaced Japanese at the bridge site where the advance\r\nof the company had been stopped on the previous day. At the same time\r\nCompany L, 21st Infantry, passed through Company I and attacked the\r\ncenter of Breakneck Ridge as Company G started a wide envelopment\r\nto the west from Company E's position to assault OP Hill from the\r\nwest. Artillery forward observer parties went with the companies and\r\ncalled artillery fires on targets of opportunity.\r\n\r\nAt 1150 Company L encountered determined opposition from enemy\r\nrifle and mortar fire but doggedly pushed ahead for several hours and\r\nsecured the top of the ridge. Company G reached its objective, but upon\r\nreceiving intense enemy fire was forced to retire to the eastern slopes\r\nof a ridge 300 yards to the north, where it reorganized. Company E also\r\nreached its objective and then formed its night perimeter. At 1815 the\r\nJapanese launched a counterattack against the perimeter of Company G\r\nbut the attack was repulsed. For the night a platoon of heavy machine\r\nguns was attached to each rifle company to protect its perimeter.\r\n\r\nSince the position of the 2d Battalion, 19th Infantry, had by this\r\ntime become clear, Colonel Verbeck ordered the battalion to move\r\nfrom the east and to relieve the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry, on\r\nHill 1525. One company was to be established on a ridge overlooking\r\nHighway 2 while the remainder of the battalion was to block the trail\r\nthat passed Hill 1525. [688] The 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry, was to\r\npush westward from its position on Hill 1525 and cut the Ormoc road\r\nsome 1,800 yards south of Limon in order to forestall the escape of\r\nJapanese troops from Breakneck Ridge. Company A was to remain on the\r\nhill and hold it until the 2d Battalion, 19th Infantry, arrived.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Battalion, less Company A, jumped off at 0730. After it had\r\nadvanced about one and a half miles and was within sight of Highway 2,\r\nthe battalion was halted by heavy enemy fire from the front and both\r\nflanks. It renewed the attack and informed Colonel Verbeck that it was\r\nmoving slowly northwest and was less than a mile from Limon. In the\r\nmeantime the enemy attacked Company A on Hill 1525, and the company\r\nwas able to maintain its position with difficulty. Because of this\r\nfight and the fact that no contact had been established with the 2d\r\nBattalion, 19th Infantry, Colonel Verbeck ordered the battalion to\r\nrejoin Company A. The troops therefore returned and took part in the\r\nfight to repel the Japanese. The 1st Battalion withstood the enemy\r\nforce until 1400, when an estimated battalion of fresh troops from\r\nthe 57th Infantry was thrown into the fight. [689] The Americans then\r\nbroke off the engagement, and the battalion, covered by Company A,\r\nwithdrew from Hill 1525 to the vicinity of Pinamopoan. [690]\r\n\r\nInformation that the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry, was being attacked\r\non Hill 1525 reached the 2d Battalion, 19th Infantry, shortly after\r\nnoon as it was on its way to relieve the 1st Battalion. Colonel\r\nSpragins pushed forward immediately with two companies, hoping to\r\nreach the 1st Battalion by 1500, but progress was slowed by steep,\r\nslippery slopes that were often blocked by huge fallen trees. At 1630,\r\nwithout having heard any sounds of battle, which they had hoped would\r\nguide them to the 1st Battalion's position, the troops reached what\r\nthey believed to be the western slopes of Hill 1525. Patrols reported\r\nno contact either with friendly or enemy units and the 2d Battalion\r\nset up its night perimeter.\r\n\r\n\"At this time,\" states the 24th Infantry Division operations report on\r\nLeyte, \"it began to dawn on all concerned that Hill 1525, as shown on\r\nthe map, was not a single hill mass, but a long ridge of many knolls\r\nand hilltops.\" [691]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBreakneck Ridge: Second Phase\r\n\r\nOn 9 November the Japanese 26th Division arrived at Ormoc in three\r\nlarge transports with a destroyer escort. The troops landed without\r\ntheir equipment and ammunition, since aircraft from the Fifth Air Force\r\nbombed the convoy and forced it to depart before the unloading was\r\ncompleted. During the convoy's return, some of the Japanese vessels\r\nwere destroyed by the American aircraft. [692]\r\n\r\nThe arrival of these troops was in accord with a plan embodied in\r\nthe order which had been taken from the dead Japanese officer on\r\nthe previous day. This plan envisaged a grand offensive which was to\r\nstart in the middle of November. The 41st Infantry Regiment of the\r\n30th Division and the 169th and 171st Independent Infantry Battalions\r\nof the 102d Division were to secure a line that ran from a hill 3,500\r\nyards northwest of Jaro to a point just south of Pinamopoan and protect\r\nthe movement of the 1st Division to this line. With the arrival of\r\nthe 1st Division on this defensive line, a coordinated attack was to\r\nbe launched--the 1st Division seizing the Carigara area and the 41st\r\nInfantry Regiment and the 26th Division attacking the Mt. Mamban area\r\nabout ten miles southeast of Limon. (See Map 2.) The way would then\r\nbe open for a drive into Leyte Valley. [693]\r\n\r\nGeneral Krueger was quick to realize the significance of this\r\norder. Since General Suzuki apparently wished to make the mountains\r\nof northern Leyte the battleground for the island, Krueger disposed\r\nhis forces to meet the enemy threat. The X Corps was to continue\r\nits drive south down Highway 2 but at the same time was to dispose\r\nunits in the central mountain range to protect the exits from Ormoc\r\nValley into Leyte Valley. The XXIV Corps was to send a reinforced\r\nregiment into the hills northwest of Dagami to prevent any Japanese\r\nfrom infiltrating into Leyte Valley, and the corps was also to be\r\nprepared to assist elements of the X Corps that guarded the trail\r\nrunning from Daro to Dolores, a village about six miles northeast of\r\nOrmoc. A regiment of the XXIV Corps was to be placed in Sixth Army\r\nReserve at Dagami, where the central mountain range began. [694]\r\n\r\nGeneral Sibert then ordered the 24th Division to continue its\r\nattack south. The 112th Cavalry Regimental Combat Team, under\r\nBrig. Gen. Julian W. Cunningham, which was expected to arrive on 14\r\nNovember, was to relieve elements of the 1st Cavalry Division that\r\nguarded the beaches in the Carigara-Barugo area. The 1st Cavalry\r\nDivision was then to drive southwest from the central mountains and\r\nrelieve some of the pressure against the 24th Division. [695]\r\n\r\nGeneral Hodge at the same time ordered the 96th Division to seize the\r\nhigh ground between Jaro and Dagami, secure all routes of exit from\r\nthe west coast through the central mountain range, and send patrols\r\nthrough the passes to the west coast of Leyte. The division was also\r\nordered to maintain in the vicinity of Dagami one infantry regiment\r\nin Sixth Army Reserve. At the same time elements of the 7th Division\r\nhad reached the shores of Ormoc Bay in the vicinity of Baybay and\r\nwere ordered to send patrols toward Ormoc and to prepare the route\r\nfor a future advance in strength. [696]\r\n\r\nIf the attention of the Japanese could be fastened upon the X Corps in\r\nthe north and northeast, it might be possible for General Krueger to\r\nput into effect his plan to send a strong force from the XXIV Corps\r\nover the mountains far to the south along the Abuyog--Baybay road\r\nto the eastern shores of Ormoc Bay in order to reinforce elements of\r\nthe 7th Division already there. This force was to drive north toward\r\nOrmoc while elements of the X Corps pushed south toward the town along\r\nHighway 2. It might even be possible later to land an amphibious force,\r\nperhaps as large as a division, at a point just below Ormoc. But first\r\nit was all-important that the Japanese be contained in Ormoc Valley\r\nand that their attention continue to be directed to the north. [697]\r\n\r\nOn 9 November General Irving ordered the 24th Division to launch a\r\nco-ordinated assault on the following day to drive the 1st Division\r\nfrom Breakneck Ridge and also deny it commanding ground from which the\r\nJapanese could conduct delaying actions just south of the barrio of\r\nLimon. (See Map 13.) The 21st Infantry was to drive south along Highway\r\n2 and the 2d Battalion, 19th Infantry, was to proceed west from its\r\nposition on the east flank of the enemy and establish a roadblock\r\non Highway 2 about 2,000 yards south of Limon. The 1st Battalion,\r\n34th Infantry, was to make a wide enveloping movement around the\r\nwest flank of the 57th Infantry and seize the high ground known as\r\nKilay Ridge which was about 700 yards from Highway 2 and west of the\r\nproposed roadblock of the 2d Battalion, 19th Infantry. General Irving\r\nannounced: \"Success of the Leyte Campaign depends upon quickly and\r\ncompletely destroying hostile forces on our front.\" [698]\r\n\r\nBy the morning of 10 November the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry, had\r\nreorganized and re-equipped itself. The 2d and 3d Battalions of the\r\nregiment were disposed along a ridge southwest of Pinamopoan. The\r\ncompanies of the two battalions were intermingled. [699]\r\n\r\nThe rains continued to pour down upon the troops, and the thick\r\nmud was slippery and treacherous underfoot. After the artillery had\r\nfired a ten-minute concentration on Breakneck Ridge, the 21st Infantry\r\nattacked at 0945. Company A, the lead company, passed through Company\r\nE and pushed south. At 0955 Company G seized OP Hill. Simultaneously,\r\nCompany I moved to the site of the destroyed bridge 300 yards east of\r\nOP Hill. Company L moved toward the high ground 300 yards southeast\r\nof its position and at 1120 secured this ground.\r\n\r\nColonel Verbeck then ordered the 1st Battalion to attack a ridge 200\r\nyards to its front by maneuvering through the defiles on each side\r\nof the enemy-held spur. The maneuver was unsuccessful and the 1st\r\nBattalion resumed its former position. [700] The Japanese resisted\r\nall efforts of the 2d Battalion to move down the reverse slope of\r\nOP Hill. [701] During the day the 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry, and\r\nthe 2d Battalion, 19th Infantry, moved out to secure the commanding\r\npositions south of Limon. [702]\r\n\r\nThe ten guns of the 2d Battalion, 1st Artillery Regiment of the 1st\r\nDivision, were moved to a position east of Limon where they could be\r\nused to assist the 57th Infantry Regiment. [703] During the night of\r\n10-11 November the 57th Infantry severed the telephone lines from the\r\nheadquarters of the 21st Infantry to all of the regiment's battalions.\r\n\r\nThat night the American artillery fired heavy interdiction fires, and\r\nbefore 0900 on 11 November it delivered preparations, including white\r\nphosphorus shells, on enemy pockets and strong points on Breakneck\r\nRidge. Company C of the 85th Chemical Battalion maintained constant\r\nharassing fires on the reverse slopes of the east ridge and OP Hill,\r\nat the rate of approximately two 4.2-inch mortar rounds every five\r\nminutes. [704] Colonel Verbeck attached Company L to the 2d Battalion.\r\n\r\nThe 21st Infantry resumed the attack at 0900 with the 1st and 2d\r\nBattalions abreast, the 1st Battalion to the north of OP Hill and\r\nthe 2d Battalion south and west of the parts of Breakneck Ridge\r\npreviously captured.\r\n\r\nStrong elements of the 57th Infantry from the south and from positions\r\nin the wooded ridges east of Corkscrew Ridge immediately fired upon\r\nthe 2d Battalion and pinned it down for the rest of the day. The 1st\r\nBattalion encountered little opposition until it reached a point\r\nabout 300 yards south of the crest of Breakneck Ridge, where the\r\nJapanese strongly resisted. The troops then moved west of the enemy\r\nleft flank about 200 yards to enable the tanks from Company A, 44th\r\nTank Battalion, to make an attack against the main position of the\r\n57th Infantry on Breakneck Ridge. [705]\r\n\r\nThe tanks proceeded along Highway 2 up Breakneck Ridge and down its\r\nreverse slope. They destroyed an estimated twenty-five enemy positions\r\nwhich contained automatic weapons. One tank got stuck when it went off\r\nthe edge of the road. As darkness approached, its crew was rescued by\r\nanother tank which then put a 75-mm. shell into the stalled vehicle\r\nto prevent its use by the Japanese. [706]\r\n\r\nAt 1600 the 308th Bombardment Wing dropped twenty-eight 500-pound\r\nbombs on the Valencia airfield in the middle of Ormoc Valley and\r\ntwenty-four 500-pound bombs on a Highway 2 bridge in the vicinity of\r\nthe airfield. [707]\r\n\r\nAt nightfall the 1st Battalion had secured its objective, a ridge\r\n300 yards to the southwest of OP Hill, and all positions were\r\nconsolidated. During the night the 226th and 465th Field Artillery\r\nBattalions placed harassing fire on the enemy positions. In order\r\nto shake the morale of the Japanese, the artillery fired its rounds\r\nat exact five-minute intervals but scattered the fire throughout the\r\nenemy-held area. [708]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of 12 November the 3d Battalion, supported by six tanks\r\nand a platoon from the 632d Tank Destroyer Battalion, moved out along\r\nthe road skirting the crest of Breakneck Ridge. By 1115 it had passed\r\nover the crest and was moving down the reverse slope. After the 3d\r\nBattalion crossed the hill, the 1st Battalion attacked on the right\r\nof the road with the mission of enveloping the Japanese left (north)\r\nflank. [709] There was little resistance, and soon after 1200 the\r\ncrest of Breakneck Ridge was in the hands of the 21st Infantry. But\r\nshortly afterward the 2d Field Artillery Battalion of the 1st Division\r\nshelled the regiment and stopped all forward advance. [710]\r\n\r\nOn 13 November the 1st and 2d Battalions took up the fight, with\r\nmachine guns from the vicinity of OP Hill firing in support. The 1st\r\nand 2d Battalions advanced 600 and 400 yards, respectively. By 14\r\nNovember it appeared to General Irving that the 21st Infantry had\r\neliminated nearly all resistance on Breakneck Ridge. The regiment\r\ncontrolled the ridge proper, but several adjacent spurs, notably\r\nCorkscrew Ridge, were still controlled by the 57th Infantry. On 15\r\nNovember the 1st Battalion, the most advanced unit, was about 1,500\r\nyards north of Limon. On 16 November the 128th Infantry of the 32d\r\nDivision relieved the 21st Infantry. The battle of Breakneck Ridge\r\nhad not been an easy one for the 21st Infantry; it had lost 630\r\nmen killed, wounded, and missing, together with 135 men from other\r\ncauses. By actual count it had killed 1,779 Japanese. [711]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nThe Mountain Barrier: Part Two\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the middle of November both the Americans and the Japanese realized\r\nthat the struggle for the island of Leyte was going to be long and\r\ncostly--far longer and costlier than either had anticipated.\r\n\r\nOn 9 and 10 November, Field Marshal Hisaichi Terauchi, the senior\r\nofficer of the Japanese forces in the Philippines, held a series\r\nof conferences on the progress of the campaign. General Yamashita,\r\ncommanding general of the 14th Area Army, strongly urged that\r\nthe Leyte operation be discontinued and offered reasons for this\r\nstand: There was little likelihood that additional reinforcements\r\nwould reach the Philippines, and the vital manpower needed for the\r\ndefense of Luzon would be drained off uselessly at Leyte. The naval\r\nbattle of Leyte Gulf, he also thought, had been \"unsatisfactory\"\r\nand there was reason to believe that the air battle off Formosa\r\nhad been equally disappointing. The shortage of shipping and\r\nescort strength greatly aggravated the already difficult problem\r\nof troop transportation. Finally, the land operations were not\r\nproceeding favorably. [712] But Yamashita's superior, Field Marshal\r\nTerauchi, commanding general of the Southern Army, insisted that the\r\nreinforcement program be continued and that the battle for Leyte be\r\nbrought to a successful conclusion. General Yamashita is said to have\r\nreplied, \"I fully understand your intention. I will carry it out to\r\na successful end.\" [713]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReinforcements\r\n\r\nAt the same time General Krueger was anxious to complete the third\r\nphase of the American campaign, the two-pronged drive toward the\r\nport of Ormoc. He felt, however, that there were insufficient troops\r\nto both protect the mountain passes into Leyte Valley and make the\r\ndrives toward Ormoc.\r\n\r\nIn preparing for the Leyte Campaign, General Krueger had asked\r\nthat the units which were to participate be embarked with a 10\r\npercent overstrength. This request was disapproved. Just before the\r\nembarkation, however, he received 5,000 untrained replacements. [714]\r\nHe had also requested that during the course of the operation 18,800\r\nreplacements be delivered to the combat zone, the first 10,000 to\r\narrive by A plus 10. During the first thirty days of the operation\r\nhe would need the following replacements: 14,300 Infantry, 1,300\r\nField Artillery, 1,130 Corps of Engineers, 750 Medical Corps, 375\r\nAntiaircraft Artillery and Coast Artillery, 185 Quartermaster Corps,\r\n185 Ordnance, 185 Signal, and all others 375. Approximately 6 percent\r\nof these should be officers.

At no time did General Krueger\r\nknow when replacements would arrive, or whether they would be combat or\r\nservice troops, or what their individual specialties would be. During\r\nthe course of the operation he received only 336 officers and 4,953\r\nenlisted men as replacements.\r\n\r\nTo add to these difficulties, General MacArthur's headquarters used\r\nfigures for \"assigned strength\" rather than \"effective strength,\"\r\nthat is, the number actually present with a unit, in computing\r\nthe need for replacements. Such figures gave an entirely erroneous\r\npicture, since evacuations were to change rapidly the figures for\r\nmedical installations, and dispositions reports were delayed for\r\nlong periods. For example, on 12 November the assigned strength of\r\nthe Sixth Army was only 289 officers and 1,874 enlisted men short\r\nof its Table of Organization strength, but its effective strength\r\nwas 1,050 officers and 11,754 enlisted men short of the Table of\r\nOrganization strength. By 20 December this shortage had pyramided to\r\nabout 21,000--considerably more than a division. (Table 1) General\r\nKrueger was seriously concerned about the situation, especially since\r\nnearly 79 percent of the casualties occurred in the infantry. [716]\r\n\r\nFortunately, the 32d and 77th Infantry Divisions--the Sixth Army\r\nreserve--were due to come in soon or had already done so, and there\r\nwere on the island additional units that were to have used Leyte\r\nas a shipping area for subsequent operations. The availability of\r\nthe 11th Airborne Division, under Maj. Gen. Joseph M. Swing, and the\r\n112th Cavalry Regimental Combat Team, [717] under General Cunningham,\r\nwas most timely. They could be used to help guard the mountain passes\r\ninto Leyte Valley and also to give support to the drive of X Corps\r\nsouth down the Ormoc Valley.\r\n\r\nAt the same time General Krueger proposed that as soon as there were\r\nsufficient troops and supplies available, an amphibious landing be\r\nmade near Ormoc to capture the town. This operation would speedily\r\nreduce the Japanese opposition south of Ormoc, cut the enemy's line of\r\ncommunication at Ormoc, and place the hostile forces in Ormoc Valley\r\n\"in a vise which could shortly squeeze them into extermination.\" [718]\r\n\r\nThe supporting naval forces, however, could not make available\r\nsufficient assault and resupply shipping to mount and support such\r\nan operation. The Navy also thought that there was insufficient\r\nair support on the island to insure the safe arrival of a convoy\r\ninto Ormoc Bay. There was a strong possibility that severe losses\r\nmight result from the suicide bombing techniques of the Japanese\r\npilots. General Krueger therefore set aside his plan until it could\r\nbe introduced at a more opportune time. [719] When the 11th Airborne\r\nDivision arrived, General Krueger could attach it to the XXIV Corps\r\nin southern Leyte. General Hodge could then relieve some of the troops\r\nthat had been guarding the mountain entrances into the valley and also\r\nsend additional support to the troops on the shores of Ormoc Bay,\r\nthus enabling the XXIV Corps to launch a strong drive toward Ormoc\r\nfrom the south.\r\n\r\nGeneral Krueger originally had planned to have the 32d Division, under\r\nMaj. Gen. William H. Gill, establish control over southern Samar, but\r\nin view of the limited number of Japanese on that island, he decided\r\nto make use of the division to add momentum to the attack of X Corps\r\nand to give rest to the weary troops of the 24th Division. [720]\r\nOn 14 November General Krueger therefore directed General Sibert\r\nto relieve the units of the 24th Division with elements of the 32d\r\nDivision. At the same time, the 112th Cavalry was attached to the\r\n1st Cavalry Division in order to give impetus to the attack. [721]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n32d Division Assumes the Offensive\r\n\r\nGeneral Sibert made arrangements for the introduction of the 32d\r\nDivision and the 112th Cavalry into the battle. The 2d Battalion,\r\n19th Infantry, and the 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry, which had reached\r\npositions overlooking Highway 2 south of Limon, were to remain in those\r\nlocations and temporarily under the operational control of General\r\nGill. The 112th Cavalry was to operate in the mountains between Ormoc\r\nand Leyte Valleys and assist the 1st Cavalry Division in a drive to\r\nthe southwest toward Highway 2. A regimental combat team from the 32d\r\nDivision was to relieve the 21st Infantry on Breakneck Ridge. Another\r\nregiment from the division would mop up in the vicinity of Hill 1525\r\nand prepare to assist in the drive south. Elements of the division were\r\nto relieve the units of the 24th Division in the Daro area, from which\r\nthe artillery had been shelling Ormoc. The 24th Division artillery\r\nwas to support the advance of the 32d Division until relieved. [722]\r\nThe flanks of the 32d Division were protected. The 2d Battalion,\r\n19th Infantry, had established a roadblock on Highway 2, about 2,000\r\nyards south of Limon, and the 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry, was on\r\nthe high ground known as Kilay Ridge, which was 700 yards from the\r\nroad and west of the roadblock of the 2d Battalion, 19th Infantry.\r\n\r\nGeneral Gill directed the 128th Infantry of the 32d Division, commanded\r\nby Col. John A. Hettinger, to pass through the 21st Infantry and\r\nattack south astride Highway 2, to push through Breakneck Ridge,\r\nand to capture Limon, 1,500 yards to the south. Colonel Hettinger\r\nordered the regiment to move out on 16 November at 0800 with battalions\r\nabreast--the 3d Battalion, commanded by Lt. Col. William A. Duncan,\r\non the right (west) of Highway 2, and the 1st Battalion, commanded\r\nby Lt. Col. James P. Burns, on the left. [723] (Map 14)\r\n\r\nThe forward elements of the 1st and 3d Battalions moved out of their\r\nassembly areas on time. They were followed by the remainder of the\r\ntroops as fast as rations and ammunition could be distributed. The\r\nbattalions assembled immediately in the rear of the 21st Infantry\r\nand at 1200 pushed through that regiment and entered upon their first\r\nbattle on Leyte. [724]\r\n\r\nColonel Hettinger ordered Colonel Burns to overcome the enemy\r\nopposition on Corkscrew Ridge. The 1st Battalion made little\r\nprogress. Company A was immediately pinned down by machine gun,\r\nmortar, and rifle fire, and Company B went forward only 150 yards. The\r\n3d Battalion encountered no opposition and advanced to a point 350\r\nyards south of its line of departure, from which Company M delivered\r\nmachine gun fire and Company L rifle fire at long range on the enemy\r\nin the vicinity of Limon. [725]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of 17 November the 1st Battalion reached the slopes\r\nof Corkscrew Ridge, where it dug in. At 0737 the 3d Battalion moved\r\nout along Highway 2 with companies abreast--Company K on the right\r\nand Company L on the left. Company K met no resistance, advanced\r\nabout 1,000 yards, and reached a ridge about 500 yards north of\r\nLimon. Elements of the 57th Infantry stopped Company L almost\r\nimmediately, but a platoon from the company moved fifty yards west\r\naround the pocket of resistance and destroyed it. The company then\r\ncontinued its advance to the ridge. [726] Companies K and L dug in\r\non the ridge for the night. [727]\r\n\r\nOn the following morning Colonel Hettinger ordered the 3d Battalion to\r\nhold its position until the 1st Battalion could come abreast. The 3d\r\nBattalion therefore limited its activities to sending out patrols. The\r\n1st Battalion again attacked Corkscrew Ridge but made very limited\r\ngains.\r\n\r\nElements of the 57th Infantry had dug in on the reverse slope of\r\nthe ridge, and heavy jungle prevented complete observation of these\r\nenemy positions. The Japanese regiment had placed automatic weapons\r\nto command the only routes of approach, thus forcing the American\r\ntroops to move uphill in the face of hostile fire. The 2d Artillery\r\nBattalion had placed its guns so that they covered Highway 2. [728]\r\n\r\nThe 1st Battalion continued to besiege Corkscrew Ridge until 20\r\nNovember, while the 3d Battalion remained on the ridge overlooking\r\nLimon. Late in the afternoon of 21 November, Colonel Hettinger\r\nordered the 128th Infantry to seize Limon, and then move south to\r\nsecure a bridge-crossing over a tributary of the Leyte River. The\r\n1st Battalion was to contain the enemy on Corkscrew Ridge. The two\r\nassault battalions of the regiment got into position on the ridge\r\nnorth of Limon, the 2d Battalion on the east side of Highway 2 and\r\nthe 3d on the west side. [729]\r\n\r\nDuring the night the 120th Field Artillery Battalion delivered\r\nharassing fire along the road between Limon and the Limon\r\nbridge. [730] At 0800 the assault troops moved out. The 3d Battalion\r\nmet little opposition, but the 2d met strong resistance from the 57th\r\nInfantry. [731] Company I encountered no resistance as it moved along\r\na bluff which was just west of the town and which overlooked Limon and\r\nthe bridge. Company K and the 2d Battalion pushed through Limon and\r\nat 1400 the leading elements crossed a tributary of the Leyte River\r\nsouth of the town. A determined Japanese counterattack forced back the\r\nleft flank of the 2d Battalion and exposed Company K. A sudden flood\r\nof the stream, caused by heavy rains, cut off the advance elements\r\nof Company K south of the river from the rest of the company. These\r\ntroops moved to the right and joined Company I on the bluffs. The\r\nrest of the company and the 2d Battalion established a night perimeter\r\nalong a ridge east of the village. The 3d Battalion, less Company K,\r\nestablished itself for the night around the positions of Company I\r\nthat overlooked the bridge and the tributary of the river. [732]\r\n\r\nOn 23 November the 128th Infantry straightened out its lines and\r\nconsolidated its positions. For the next three days activity was\r\nlimited to extensive patrols and the placement of harassing fire\r\non an east-west ridge that overlooked the highway about 1,000 yards\r\nsouth of Limon. Entrenched on this ridge, elements of the 1st Division\r\nsuccessfully resisted until 10 December all efforts of the 32d Division\r\nto dislodge them. [733]\r\n\r\nWith the occupation of Limon, the battle of Breakneck Ridge was over,\r\nbut a number of bypassed pockets of resistance were not eliminated\r\nuntil mid-December. The battle cost the 24th and 32d Divisions a\r\ntotal of 1,498 casualties, killed, wounded, and missing in action, as\r\ncompared with an estimated 5,252 Japanese killed and 8 captured. [734]\r\n\r\nThe Japanese had failed in their attempt to block off Highway 2\r\nat the northern entrance to Ormoc Valley. In no small measure, the\r\nestablishment and maintenance of a roadblock south of Limon by the\r\n2d Battalion, 19th Infantry, and the defense of Kilay Ridge in the\r\nrear of the Japanese front lines by the 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry,\r\nhad made this achievement possible. (See Map 13.) Under constant fire\r\nand greatly outnumbered, these units had prevented General Suzuki\r\nfrom sending additional troops into Limon. From 12 to 23 November\r\nthe 2d Battalion, 19th Infantry, had defended the roadblock under\r\nextremely difficult conditions. The operations report of the 24th\r\nDivision graphically summarizes the deeds for which the battalion\r\nreceived a presidential citation:\r\n\r\n\r\n    These bearded, mud caked soldiers came out of the mountains\r\n    exhausted and hungry. Their feet were heavy, cheeks hollow, bodies\r\n    emaciated, and eyes glazed. They had seen thirty-one comrades\r\n    mortally wounded, watched fifty-five others lie suffering in muddy\r\n    foxholes without adequate medical attention. Yet their morale had\r\n    not changed. It was high when they went in and high when they came\r\n    out. They were proud that they had rendered invaluable aid to the\r\n    main forces fighting in ORMOC CORRIDOR, by disrupting the Japanese\r\n    supply lines and preventing strong reinforcements from passing\r\n    up the ORMOC ROAD. They were proud that they had outfought the\r\n    Emperor's toughest troops, troops that had been battle trained in\r\n    Manchuria. They were certain they had killed at least 606 of the\r\n    enemy and felt that their fire had accounted for many more. And\r\n    they were proud that this had all been accomplished despite\r\n    conditions of extreme hardship. Two hundred and forty-one of the\r\n    battalion's officers and enlisted men were hospitalized for skin\r\n    disorders, foot ulcers, battle fatigue, and sheer exhaustion. [735]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry, under Colonel Clifford, operated west\r\nof Highway 2 on Kilay Ridge, behind the Japanese front lines. It \"wrote\r\na brilliant page in the history of the campaign\" [736] but, since its\r\ninfluence on the situation was not appreciated until later and since\r\nit affords an excellent example of a battalion fighting independently,\r\nthe operation of \"Clifford's Battalion\" will be discussed separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBattle of Kilay Ridge\r\n\r\nWhen General Krueger told General Sibert to push the X Corps south\r\nwith all possible speed down Highway 2 toward Ormoc, the latter had\r\nselected the 24th Division to make the drive. General Irving wished\r\nto protect the sides of the road and prevent the Japanese from sending\r\nreinforcements north up the highway. On 9 November he therefore ordered\r\nthe 34th Infantry to send a battalion around the Japanese west flank\r\nto harass the enemy's rear and thus relieve the pressure that was\r\nholding up the frontal attack of the 21st Infantry on Breakneck Ridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNipponese Caught Napping\r\n\r\nAt 0100 on 10 November Colonel Dahlen, commander of the 34th Infantry,\r\nalerted the 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry, for an amphibious landing\r\nto take place at 0700. The battalion had been in contact with the\r\nenemy for twenty-one days and was reduced to an effective strength\r\nof 560 men. The 1st Battalion, with an observer's party from the\r\n63d Field Artillery Battalion, was ordered to move from Capoocan\r\nin eighteen LVT's and proceed seven miles northwest up the coast of\r\nCarigara Bay. [737] It was then to move inland and seize Kilay Ridge,\r\nwhich was west of the Ormoc road some 3,000 yards behind the Japanese\r\nfront lines. [738]\r\n\r\nAt 0700 the battalion, under Colonel Clifford, moved out, taking every\r\navailable man on the mission and leaving only a minimum of cooks and\r\ndrivers behind. Since the troops had to hand-carry their equipment\r\nthe Headquarters Company left the antitank guns behind, and Company\r\nD took only one section of heavy machine guns and one section of\r\n81-mm. mortars. Colonel Clifford used the men thus released to carry\r\nother weapons and ammunition. Because of the scant time allowed by\r\nthe orders, the battalion left without sufficient rations.\r\n\r\nAt 0750 Clifford's battalion went aboard the LVT's and at 0930\r\narrived at its destination. Debarking without opposition it pushed\r\nrapidly inland and at 1145 reached a hill approximately one mile\r\nfrom the landing area. At dusk the 1st Battalion reached a ridge in\r\nthe vicinity of Belen and about 2,000 yards north of Agahang. There\r\nit set up a night perimeter. Since his maps were inaccurate, Colonel\r\nClifford relied upon the services of Filipino guides from this time\r\nuntil the end of the mission. The rugged and muddy hillsides, made\r\nconsiderably worse by almost constant rain and fog, were similar to\r\nthose encountered by other units fighting in the area.\r\n\r\nAt 0730 on 11 November Colonel Clifford sent out patrols to pick up a\r\npromised airdrop of rations. The battalion had been without food since\r\nthe morning before. At 0910 Colonel Dahlen ordered Colonel Clifford not\r\nto move on to Agahang, which was about 3,800 yards northwest of Limon,\r\nuntil he received rations. The rations were not forthcoming but at\r\n1400 Dahlen told Clifford to obtain the promised rations at Agahang,\r\nto which the battalion then proceeded. No supplies were received,\r\nbut Filipinos furnished the unit with bananas, cooked rice, boiled\r\npotatoes, and a few chickens. A night perimeter was set up. [739]\r\n\r\nAt 0850 on the following day Colonel Clifford's men received their\r\nfirst airdrop of rations. Ten minutes later the commanding officer of\r\nthe 1st Battalion of the guerrilla 96th Infantry made contact with\r\nColonel Clifford and gave him a résumé of the enemy situation. (The\r\nguerrillas rendered invaluable aid to the 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry,\r\nthroughout the Kilay Ridge episode by furnishing intelligence and\r\nprotecting the rear of the unit.) The battalion moved out at 1200\r\nfor Consuegra near the Naga River and entered the town at 1240. At\r\n1310 Colonel Clifford outlined to the officers the plan for the next\r\ntwo days. For the rest of the day, the battalion was to advance to\r\nCabiranan and bivouac for the night. On the morning of 13 November\r\nit was to split into two columns and make a fast advance by separate\r\nroutes to Kilay Ridge, where it would reorganize. As Colonel Clifford\r\nwas briefing his officers, LVT's entered Consuegra with rations for\r\nthe troops. The LVT's had left Carigara Bay, passed through Biliran\r\nStrait, gone down Leyte Bay and into the Naga River, and then proceeded\r\nup the river to the vicinity of Consuegra.\r\n\r\nAt 0855 on 13 November a column of Filipino men, women, and children\r\nentered the perimeter and brought approximately thirty-five boxes of\r\nrations from Consuegra. The battalion left the area at 0930 and reached\r\nthe ridge without opposition. Trenches and prepared gun positions\r\nwithout a man in them honeycombed the ridge from one end to the\r\nother. It was evident that elements of the 1st Division had intended\r\nto occupy the area in the latter stages of the battle for Limon. [740]\r\n\r\nKilay Ridge ran from southeast to northwest, with its northern tip\r\nabout 2,500 yards directly west of Limon and its southern end about\r\n3,000 yards south and slightly west of the same point. The ridge was\r\napproximately 900 feet high and though narrow in some places in others\r\nit widened to 400 yards. The summit was broken into a series of high\r\nknolls from which the entire Limon area and some parts of the Ormoc\r\nroad could be observed. A view of the latter feature was obstructed\r\nto some extent by a ridge, hereafter called Ridge Number 2, between\r\nKilay and the road. Kilay Ridge was about 3,900 yards southwest of\r\nBreakneck Ridge. It would be necessary to maintain control of Kilay\r\nRidge and deny its use to the enemy in order to give complete support\r\nto units advancing south from Breakneck Ridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreliminary Attack\r\n\r\nOn 14 November Colonel Clifford ordered his battalion to entrench\r\nitself along the ridge in positions that would afford the best\r\ntactical advantage. The battalion established strong points and\r\nobservation posts on the knolls, placed blocks on the trails leading\r\nthrough the area, and sent out reconnaissance patrols to locate\r\nenemy positions. Colonel Clifford made arrangements to utilize the\r\nFilipinos as carriers. These men were to use a trail on the north end\r\nof the ridge and bring supplies to the battalion from a supply dump\r\nat Consuegra. The first human pack train arrived in the area at 1010\r\nwith twenty-eight cases of rations and a supply of batteries for the\r\nradios. [741]\r\n\r\nAt 1125 enemy artillery shelled the southern end of the ridge and\r\ntwenty minutes later shifted its fire to the Limon area. The battalion\r\ndid not succeed in establishing physical contact with the 2d Battalion,\r\n19th Infantry, which was operating east of the road, but it was able\r\nto make radio contact. Throughout the day, patrols of the battalion\r\nwere active in searching out enemy positions.\r\n\r\nOn 15 November Company A sent a patrol to Ridge Number 2, which was\r\n600 yards east of the battalion's positions and which overlooked\r\nthe Ormoc road. The patrol found numerous enemy emplacements and\r\napproximately fifty Japanese, who began firing with mortars. After\r\nkilling five of the Japanese the patrol retired. [742] During the day\r\nthe 24th Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop reported to Colonel Clifford\r\nand was assigned the mission of patrolling the west flank of the\r\nbattalion. Although patrols from the 1st Battalion pushed east of\r\nthe Ormoc highway south of Limon, they again were unable to make\r\ncontact with the 2d Battalion, 19th Infantry. On 16 November Colonel\r\nClifford again sent out patrols which tried, still unsuccessfully,\r\nto establish physical contact with this battalion. [743]\r\n\r\nA platoon from Company B, on 17 November, carried on a running\r\nfire fight with the Japanese and forced its way past Ridge Number\r\n2. It crossed the Ormoc road and made contact with the 2d Battalion,\r\n19th Infantry, at its roadblock. A line of communication between the\r\nbattalions could not be established because of the strong enemy forces\r\nbetween them. At the same time parts of Companies B and D engaged\r\nthe enemy on Ridge Number 3, six hundred yards south of Ridge Number\r\n2 and slightly lower. Approximately 200 of the enemy with rifles,\r\nmachine guns, mortars, and artillery were entrenched on Ridge Number\r\n3. The American fire killed at least fifty Japanese. A patrol from\r\nCompany D probed the Japanese defensive position but was forced to\r\nretire with two men missing and one wounded. Then Company B entered\r\nthe fray, and the fire fight grew in intensity. The Japanese directed\r\nfire from at least three automatic weapons as well as strong rifle\r\nfire against the Americans.\r\n\r\nColonel Clifford went to investigate and found Company B engaged\r\nin a bitter fight. While he was there the company sustained six\r\ncasualties. One of the men had been shot through the thigh and was\r\nunable to walk. Since the heavy underbrush and bad trails made it\r\nimpossible for two men to carry him on a litter, Colonel Clifford\r\ncarried the wounded soldier on his back for about a mile to the\r\ncommand post, over a difficult mountain trail which ran for several\r\nhundred yards in the bed of a swift stream. [744] Colonel Clifford\r\nwas awarded a Distinguished Service Cross. [745]\r\n\r\nAt nightfall Company B was separated from the rest of the\r\nbattalion. Colonel Clifford decided to pull the company off the ridge\r\nand replace it with Company C. He was determined to hold what he had\r\n\"at all costs.\" [746] During the day General Sibert attached the\r\nbattalion to the 32d Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRed Badge of Courage\r\n\r\nAt daylight on 18 November Colonel Clifford brought heavy machine\r\nguns into place on the perimeter of the battalion and began to fire\r\non the enemy positions on Ridge Number 3, catching a group of about\r\ntwenty-five Japanese who were cooking their breakfast. At 0700 a\r\ncarrying party with rations and medical supplies moved out toward the\r\nbesieged Company B, and at 1100 Company C started forward to relieve\r\nthe company. Colonel Clifford decided to displace a platoon at a\r\ntime during the day. Under intense rifle fire, Company C succeeded in\r\nrelieving Company B. The fire fight continued throughout the day, and\r\napproximately fifty more Japanese were killed. At 1200 the battalion\r\nconducted burial services for Henry Kilay, a Filipino soldier and\r\nguide who had served the battalion well. [747] During the night and\r\ncontinuing into 19 November, Japanese heavy machine guns fired into\r\nthe perimeter on Ridge Number 2.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the enemy began to deliver heavy fire against\r\nCompany B, which had moved to the south flank of the battalion on\r\nKilay Ridge. Colonel Clifford estimated the Japanese assault force\r\nto be one reinforced company well equipped with mortars and light\r\nmachine guns. By 0905 on 19 November the Japanese had destroyed one\r\nheavy machine gun and had begun a flanking movement to the east of\r\nthe southernmost outpost of Company B.\r\n\r\nThe artillery liaison party moved south and directed artillery fire\r\non the enemy. By 1150, however, Company B was being surrounded and\r\nits ammunition was very low. Colonel Clifford made a reconnaissance\r\nof the area and ordered the besieged company to fall back 100 yards\r\nto the north and set up a strong point with the assistance of Company\r\nA. The next morning Company A was to attack and retake the knoll from\r\nwhich Company B had been forced to retire. Because of strong Japanese\r\nresistance, the gradual attrition of the battalion's forces, and the\r\n\"extreme scarcity\" of ammunition, Colonel Clifford also decided to\r\nhave Company C withdraw from Ridge Number 2 to Kilay Ridge on the\r\nfollowing morning. [748]\r\n\r\nRain fell constantly upon the troops and churned the surface of the\r\nridge into a \"slick mass of mud and slime.\" [749] Men were tired. With\r\ninsufficient rations, broken sleep in sodden foxholes, and constant\r\nharassing fire, many had sickened. Fever, dysentery, and foot ulcers\r\nwere commonplace.\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of 20 November Company C withdrew silently in\r\nthe rain without the knowledge of the Japanese, who threw an attack\r\nof company strength against the position thirty minutes after it had\r\nbeen vacated. Company C established a strong position 200 yards south\r\nof the battalion command post. The artillery fired intermittently on\r\nthe enemy to the south until 1200, when it concentrated its fire in\r\nfront of Company B. So intense was the rain that although artillery\r\nshells were falling only 150 yards away, the artillery liaison party\r\nhad to adjust the fire almost entirely by sound. At 1225 Company B\r\nmoved out in an effort to retake the knoll from which the enemy had\r\nlaunched his attacks the previous day, but it came under intense\r\nrifle and mortar fire which forced it to retire. At this point the\r\nbattalion's supply of ammunition became critically low. [750]\r\n\r\nThe downpour continued through the night and the next day. Patrols,\r\nsent to search for a means of flanking the Japanese, were unsuccessful,\r\nbut they brought back information which made it possible to place\r\nartillery and mortar fire on enemy positions. At 1430 Colonel Clifford\r\nreceived the report that two strong Japanese columns were converging\r\non the battalion from the southeast and northeast. One of the platoons\r\nfrom Company C moved to the north end of the ridge to assure that\r\nthe supply line to Consuegra would be kept open. A carrying party\r\nfrom Consuegra brought in rations and at 1705 the battalion received\r\nan airdrop of blankets, ammunition, and litters. [751] There was no\r\nmajor enemy contact.\r\n\r\nThe rains persisted during the night and the next day, 22\r\nNovember. Throughout the morning, patrols probed the area. At 1130\r\nthe battalion received an airdrop of ammunition, medical supplies,\r\nand ponchos. The main perimeter lines were comparatively quiet until\r\n1430 when the enemy pinned down Company B with heavy fire and assaulted\r\nCompany A. These attacks rapidly grew in intensity. The Japanese with\r\nfixed bayonets charged against the perimeters and almost completely\r\nsurrounded both companies.\r\n\r\nAt 2000, since the enemy completely surrounded Company B, Colonel\r\nClifford ordered the company to break through and withdraw through\r\nCompany A to the rear of the battalion command post. Under cover of\r\nmachine gun and artillery fire, the company withdrew. When a litter\r\ntrain of the wounded was ambushed, one of the bearers was killed by\r\nenemy fire.\r\n\r\nWithin the new perimeter of Company B, 750 yards north of the battalion\r\ncommand post, Colonel Clifford established a rear command post and\r\nall communications moved to it. From this new location the mortars\r\nfrom Company D began to fire in front of Company A, the most advanced\r\ncompany. The battalion cached all supplies and ammunition in case\r\nthe enemy should suddenly break through. The rains continued.\r\n\r\nColonel Clifford made tentative plans to withdraw during the night\r\nbut abandoned them when General Gill ordered him to hold the ridge at\r\nall costs. Advance elements of the 32d Division had entered Limon,\r\nand the withdrawal of Clifford's battalion would have left their\r\nwestern flank completely exposed. [752]\r\n\r\nFortunately the Japanese did not follow up the attacks on 23 November,\r\nbut there was scattered automatic weapons and artillery fire. Next day\r\nAmerican artillery and mortar fire repulsed a small enemy attack at\r\n0830. A platoon from the battalion slipped through the enemy lines and\r\nbrought information on the situation to General Gill. It returned with\r\norders that the battalion was to hold fast. Two airdrops of supplies,\r\nalthough they drew enemy fire, were successfully recovered.\r\n\r\nFor the next two days there was comparative quiet in the sector\r\nexcept for patrol activity and intermittent fire. At 1000 on 25\r\nNovember, General Gill sent Colonel Clifford the following message:\r\n\"You and your men are doing a superb job. Hang on and keep killing\r\nthe Japs....\" [753]\r\n\r\nAt nightfall on 25 November, however, the semiquiet was shattered when\r\nan enemy force armed with automatic weapons, mortars, and artillery\r\nbegan a heavy assault against the perimeter of Company A. The company\r\nbeat off the attack with losses to both forces. On the following\r\nmorning, Colonel Clifford had Company C relieve Company A. At 1630\r\nColonel Dahlen informed him that he, Clifford, was \"in a tight spot,\"\r\nsince the 32d Division could give \"no immediate help,\" and advised\r\nhim to \"use artillery and hang on.\" [754] It became apparent that\r\nthe Japanese were so disposed that they could launch attacks from\r\ndifferent directions. Further evidence to this effect was supplied\r\non 27 November, when a Japanese patrol of almost platoon strength\r\ngot astride the supply line to Consuegra on the northern front of\r\nKilay Ridge. A patrol from Company B dispersed the unit and killed\r\nthree of the enemy. Colonel Clifford estimated that elements of the\r\n1st Regiment were disposed as follows: a minimum of one reinforced\r\ncompany was south of him, at least two reinforced companies were on\r\nthe ridge about 1,000 yards to the east, and a strong but unknown\r\nnumber of the enemy opposed him on the west. If this last force pushed\r\nnorthward Clifford's supply line to Consuegra would be severed. From\r\n1725 to 2020 on 27 November, Company C came under a strong long-range\r\nattack from enemy positions on the ridge to the east. A patrol from\r\nthe 128th Infantry, 32d Division, brought Colonel Clifford the welcome\r\ninformation that reinforcements were en route.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Main Effort\r\n\r\nAt 1000 on 28 November the battalion repulsed a small party of the\r\nenemy that attacked from the south. There was a lull until 1930 when\r\nthe Japanese unleashed a strong effort to drive the defenders from\r\nKilay Ridge and recapture it. The opening was marked by 90-mm. mortar\r\nfire upon the outposts of the battalion. Heavy weapons from the ridge\r\non the east then began firing as at least two machine guns and many\r\nsmall arms began to rain lead from the west. The enemy fire rose to a\r\ncrescendo as the mortars joined in and directed their heaviest fire\r\nat a platoon of Company C on the southwestern end of the ridge. The\r\nJapanese began to deploy troops, apparently in an attempt to reach a\r\ngulch to the west of the battalion's positions. A heavy assault was\r\nlaunched from the south against Company C.\r\n\r\nBy 1955 the mortars of the battalion were brought to bear against\r\nthe advancing Japanese as the crews worked in feverish haste to break\r\nup the assault. At 2015, although Company C now had mortar support,\r\nthe enemy charged with bayonets and grenades. Fighting was at close\r\nquarters and the Japanese began to infiltrate the forward positions. An\r\nhour later the advance platoon of Company C pulled back to join the\r\ncompany, which had been cut off from the rest of the battalion. The\r\nfire fight continued throughout the night with constant rifle fire,\r\nnumerous attempts at infiltration by the Japanese, and intermittent\r\nmortar fire. [755]\r\n\r\nAt dawn on 29 November the Japanese forces were still on the ridge in\r\nstrength and their automatic weapons began to fire anew. All forward\r\nelements of the battalion were under attack and Company C was still\r\nseparated from the rest of the battalion. A reinforced platoon from\r\nCompany B, at 0730, was able to break through to Company C, kill six\r\nof the enemy, and seize two machine guns en route. As Company C's\r\nammunition was practically exhausted, Colonel Clifford immediately\r\nsent a carrying party forward. Since the Japanese had blocked off the\r\ntrail immediately after the passage of the platoon from Company B,\r\nthe carrying party was pinned down.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime two carrying parties from Consuegra entered the\r\nperimeter of the battalion with food and ammunition. One carried the\r\n\"Thanksgiving ration of roast turkey and ... fresh eggs.\" The battalion\r\ntherefore hoped for \"a good meal\" if the situation permitted. [756]\r\n\r\nColonel Clifford urgently requested General Gill to send\r\nreinforcements. At 1325 Gill told Clifford that he had ordered the 2d\r\nBattalion, 128th Infantry, 32d Division, to proceed to Kilay Ridge\r\nimmediately and come under Clifford's control. Colonel Clifford\r\nforcibly reopened the trail to Company C and had food and ammunition\r\nbrought into the forward position. A short time later, Company G,\r\n128th Infantry, arrived and Clifford immediately committed it to\r\nreinforce Company C. The remainder of the 2d Battalion, 128th Infantry,\r\narrived at 1835 and was held in reserve. (See Map 14.)\r\n\r\nThe action for 1 December began at 0800 when a patrol from Company\r\nB proceeded down a draw to the west of Kilay Ridge. The patrol was\r\nto swing wide and approach the right rear almost directly south\r\nof the enemy-held knolls on Kilay Ridge. These were thought to be\r\nthe Japanese strong points and were the objectives for the day. A\r\npreparatory concentration from supporting artillery and from mortars\r\nof both battalions was first laid. The heavy machine gun section of\r\nthe 128th Infantry moved into the draw to the west and set up its guns\r\non the right flank of the ridge in order to be in a position to fire\r\nacross the face of the ridge when the main assault began. Company E\r\nof the 128th Infantry then passed through Company C and launched an\r\nattack against the Japanese-held knolls on the southeastern end of\r\nthe ridge. Heavy and light machine gun fire from Company C protected\r\nthe flanks of Company E.\r\n\r\nThe company took the first knoll easily, but heavy fire from behind\r\na huge log on the second knoll halted Company E. Company A sent a\r\nbazooka team forward to knock out the position and Company C sent all\r\nof its grenades forward, but by 1320 the Japanese soldiers were still\r\nresisting all attempts to dislodge them. The patrol from Company B\r\nreturned at 1345 with the report that it had been to the rear of its\r\nobjective and had seen no enemy activity. No unit made any further\r\nprogress that day. At 1720 General Gill ordered Colonel Clifford to\r\nwithdraw the 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry. [757]\r\n\r\nAt 0925 on 2 December, Company E, 128th Infantry, attacked the knolls\r\nat the south tip of Kilay Ridge, while Company F moved down the ridge\r\nand swung to the right to attack the ridge to the south--the objective\r\nof the two-battalion assault. The 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry,\r\nwithdrew one unit, but at 1245 Colonel Clifford received orders to halt\r\nall further withdrawals pending orders from the commanding officer,\r\n128th Infantry. By then Company E had taken its objective but Company F\r\nhad encountered determined resistance fifty yards from the top of the\r\nridge. It doggedly advanced and by 1625 reached the crest and dug in,\r\nthough still receiving hostile mortar fire.\r\n\r\nThe next day examination of the battlefield where the two battalions\r\nhad been fighting revealed numerous enemy dead and the following\r\nabandoned equipment: three 70-mm. mountain guns, four heavy machine\r\nguns, seventeen light machine guns, one 90-mm. mortar, and many\r\nrifles, pistols, sabers, and field glasses. Documents containing\r\nvaluable intelligence were also found. On 4 December the 1st\r\nBattalion, 34th Infantry, started to withdraw. During the next two\r\ndays elements of the battalion moved through Consuegra and Calubian\r\nto Pinamopoan. The battalion had lost 26 men killed, 2 missing, and\r\n101 wounded, but it estimated that it had killed 900 men of the 1st\r\nInfantry Regiment. The 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry, had acquitted\r\nitself well. It had prevented the Japanese from reinforcing the Limon\r\nforces and imperiling the 32d Division. For its work the battalion\r\nreceived the presidential unit citation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCentral Mountain Range\r\n\r\n1st Cavalry Division\r\n\r\nAs elements of the X Corps were pushing south on Highway 2 through\r\nBreakneck Ridge, other units from the corps were engaged in securing\r\nthe central mountain range that divided Leyte and Ormoc Valleys\r\nin order to prevent any Japanese forces from debouching into Leyte\r\nValley. General Suzuki had ordered the 1st Division commander to place\r\nthe 57th Infantry in the Limon area while the 1st and 49th Infantry\r\nRegiments were to go to the central mountain range. The two regiments\r\nlast mentioned were to prevent any American attempts to infiltrate into\r\nOrmoc Valley and to exploit any favorable opportunity to break through\r\ninto Leyte Valley. About 8 November the 102d Division, including its\r\nsignal, artillery, and engineer units, arrived at Ormoc and General\r\nSuzuki immediately sent them into the mountains of central Leyte. [758]\r\n\r\nGeneral Krueger had already anticipated this movement and had stationed\r\nelements of the X and XXIV Corps at the principal entrances into\r\nLeyte Valley. On 10 November General Mudge sent elements of the 1st\r\nCavalry Division to patrol the area extensively. [759]\r\n\r\nThe northern mountains between Ormoc and Leyte Valleys were high\r\nand rugged, with precipitous sides. The area was heavily forested,\r\nand there were many ground pockets which constituted natural, heavily\r\nwooded fortresses for the Japanese. The very few trails in the sector\r\nwere scarcely better than pig trails. The area had not been properly\r\nmapped and at all times the troops were seriously handicapped by\r\ninsufficient knowledge of the terrain. The nearly constant rainfall\r\nbogged down supply and made the sides of the hills slippery and\r\ntreacherous. From 5 November through 2 December, elements of the 1st\r\nCavalry Division extensively patrolled the central mountain area and\r\nhad many encounters with small forces of the enemy. At all times the\r\nsupply situation was precarious.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Cavalry Division utilized motor transport, LVT's, tractors\r\nand trailers, native carriers, and airdrops to get supplies to\r\nforward troops. Motor transport hauled supplies from the warehouses\r\nin Tacloban to Carigara, a distance of thirty miles. At this point\r\nLVT's of the 826th Amphibian Tractor Battalion hauled the supplies,\r\nthrough rice paddies churned into waist-deep morasses, to Sugud,\r\nthree miles south of Carigara. The supplies were manhandled from the\r\nLVT's into one-ton two-wheeled cargo and ammunition trailers, which\r\nwere towed by the tractors of the artillery battalions that fired in\r\nsupport of the division. The tractors wound their way laboriously\r\ninto the foothills through boulder-strewn streams and up steep\r\ninclines that made it necessary for the tractors to be arranged in\r\ntandem. There was always mud, which made traction difficult, and the\r\nLVT's were better able than the tractors to navigate through slick,\r\nsoft mud which had little body texture.\r\n\r\nThe 12th Cavalry established high in the foothills, at the entrance to\r\nthe passes through the mountains, a supply base that was also a native\r\ncamp, a hospital, and a rest camp. About 300 Filipino carriers were\r\nkept here under the protection of the guerrillas. The carriers had been\r\nhired for six days at a time and were not allowed to leave without\r\na pass from their Filipino leader. This precaution was necessary,\r\nsince the ration-carrying assignment was extremely arduous.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder armed escort, the long train of carriers, two men to each\r\nfifty-pound load of rations, ammunition, and other types of supply,\r\nbegan immediately to struggle forward from the supply camp over\r\nnarrow, slippery trails, across waist-deep rivers and streams, and\r\nthrough heavy undergrowth. In the never-ending climb to gain altitude,\r\nit took five hours to traverse a track that measured less than three\r\nmiles. At the base of a vertical descent of more than 500 feet, there\r\nwas a second supply base, the relay station. From this station it\r\nwas another day's forced march to the forward troops. An additional\r\n300 Filipinos were stationed at the relay station in the mountain\r\nwilderness, surrounded by elements of the enemy. These carriers made\r\nthe last half of the tortuous journey, while the others returned to\r\nthe base camp for resupply. It took four days to get supplies from\r\nthe warehouses to the front-line troops. [760]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 112th Cavalry Regimental Combat Team, under General Cunningham, had\r\narrived at Leyte on 14 November. [761] At this time the 21st Infantry\r\nwas advancing very slowly along Breakneck Ridge, against strong\r\nresistance, and the units of the 1st Cavalry Division were spread\r\nthinly over the central mountain area. [762] In order to strengthen\r\nthe defense line, the 112th Cavalry was committed upon its arrival and\r\npassed to the control of X Corps. [763] On 15 November General Sibert\r\nattached the 112th Cavalry to the 1st Cavalry Division and ordered\r\nit to operate in the Carigara area. [764] General Mudge directed the\r\n112th Cavalry to assume, on 16 November, the responsibility for beach\r\ndefenses in the Capoocan-Carigara-Barugo area and to mop up in the\r\nMt. Minoro area about 3,000 yards south of Capoocan. [765]\r\n\r\nThe 112th Cavalry patrolled the Mt. Minoro area until 22 November. In\r\naccord with General Krueger's desire to relieve some of the pressure\r\nthat was being exerted against the 32d Division in its drive south down\r\nHighway 2, General Mudge on 23 November ordered the 112th Cavalry to\r\nmove southwest from Mt. Minoro toward the highway. The combat team\r\nencountered sporadic resistance and on the morning of 30 November\r\nreached a ridge about 2,500 yards east of Highway 2 and about 5,000\r\nyards southeast of Limon. [766] A strongly entrenched enemy force on\r\nthe ridge resisted all attempts of the 112th Cavalry to dislodge it.\r\n\r\nThe ridge was covered with a dense rain forest, and the lower slopes\r\nwere thickly spotted with bamboo thickets and other extremely dense\r\nvegetation. Clouds covered the tops of the peak and rain fell almost\r\ncontinuously, churning the ground into ankle-deep mud. Visibility\r\nwas limited to only a few yards. The enemy defensive field works\r\nconsisted of foxholes, prone shelters, communication trenches,\r\nand palm-log bunkers. These positions presented no logical avenue\r\nof approach. They were complete perimeters and employed all-round\r\nmutually supporting automatic weapons fire. Although the fields of\r\nfire were limited, the weapons were so effectively placed that they\r\ncovered all approaches. [767]\r\n\r\nThe strong resistance made further progress impossible and the 112th\r\nCavalry established its perimeter. During the night the Japanese\r\nsubjected the 1st and 2d Squadrons, 112th Cavalry, to heavy artillery\r\nfire and launched several patrol attacks against the perimeter of\r\nthe 2d Squadron. The night assaults were beaten off. [768]\r\n\r\nThe next two days were spent by the 2d Squadron, 112th Cavalry,\r\nin trying unsuccessfully to dislodge the Japanese from the\r\nridge. At 1310 on 2 December the 112th Cavalry received orders\r\nto move north-northwest toward the Leyte River, from which point\r\nthey were to send out patrols to make contact with units of the 32d\r\nDivision. [769] At this time, however, the 112th Cavalry was still\r\nopposed by a strong enemy force. Troop A nevertheless moved out to\r\nmake contact with the 32d Division and to reconnoiter to the west\r\nfor further enemy concentrations and for routes by which the 112th\r\nCavalry could advance to Highway 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn 3 December, after an artillery concentration, Troop G, 2d Squadron,\r\n112th Cavalry, started out toward the enemy-held ridge. The slope\r\nwas so precipitous that the troops could not climb and shoot at the\r\nsame time. The Japanese were able to throw grenades upon Troop G\r\nwithout exposing themselves, and the troop retired to the bottom of\r\nthe hill. An artillery concentration was called for and delivered\r\non the ridge, after which the troop again started up the hill. The\r\nJapanese, however, quickly regained their former positions after\r\nthe artillery fire ceased and again repulsed Troop G with grenades\r\nand small arms fire. The troop withdrew to its former position at\r\nthe bottom of the hill. For the remainder of the day, the artillery\r\nplaced harassing fire on the enemy strong point while patrols probed\r\nto the south and west around the flanks of the Japanese position,\r\nseeking better avenues of approach. [770]\r\n\r\nTroop A journeyed without incident toward Highway 2, at 1415 on 3\r\nDecember made contact with the left rear of the 126th Infantry west\r\nof Hill 1525, and at the end of the day was moving southwest to make\r\ncontact with the leading elements of the 126th Infantry. No contact\r\nhad been made with the enemy and there was little sign of enemy\r\nforces. The 1st Squadron received orders to proceed to the Leyte\r\nRiver and locate a dropping ground. [771]\r\n\r\nHenceforward, until 10 December, the 2d Squadron, 112th Cavalry,\r\nwas stalemated by the strongly entrenched Japanese force. Each day\r\nrepeated attacks were made against the enemy position, but to no avail,\r\nand patrols that probed the flanks of the enemy to discover a means\r\nof enveloping the hostile force had no success. On 8 and 9 December\r\nthe 1st Squadron, 112th Cavalry, attempted to locate and cut off the\r\nsupply line of the Japanese force that was holding up the advance of\r\nthe 2d Squadron. [772]\r\n\r\nOn 10 December the 2d Squadron, 7th Cavalry, which had been in\r\nthe Barugo-Capoocan area, relieved the 2d Squadron, 112th Cavalry,\r\nwhich passed to the control of Sixth Army. In the meantime the 1st\r\nSquadron, 112th Cavalry, less Troop A had moved west toward the Leyte\r\nRiver. Troop A reached the left flank of the 126th Infantry. The\r\nprogress of the 1st Squadron was slow because of the hilly terrain,\r\nbut on the morning of 7 December it arrived at the Leyte River and\r\nestablished physical contact with Troop A and the 126th Infantry. [773]\r\nAt the end of 10 December, the 1st Squadron, 112th Cavalry, was on\r\nthe Leyte River.\r\n\r\nThe 2d Squadron, 7th Cavalry, after relieving the 2d Squadron, 112th\r\nCavalry, sent out patrols to study the terrain and attempt to find\r\navenues of approach to the flanks and rear of the enemy strong point\r\nwhich had long held up the 2d Squadron, 112th Cavalry. An aerial\r\nreconnaissance was made of the area. The aerial observer reported\r\nthat the Japanese position was \"definitely as bad\" as the 2d Squadron,\r\n112th Cavalry, had reported it to be, and that the approach from the\r\nrear was even worse than the one from the front. [774]\r\n\r\nThe 2d Squadron, 7th Cavalry, spent 11 December in sending out\r\npatrols on both sides of the enemy-held ridge. The Japanese let the\r\npatrols through and then fired, wounding two of the men. The patrols\r\nthen returned. An artillery concentration was placed upon the enemy\r\nposition, and at 1245 the 2d Squadron, 7th Cavalry, moved out behind\r\na barrage which lifted twenty-five yards at a time. One platoon\r\nattacked frontally while the other platoons attempted to flank the\r\nJapanese. The platoon on the right flank suffered three casualties and\r\nwas immediately pinned down. After the other platoons got to within\r\nfifty yards of a Japanese machine gun position, they also were pinned\r\ndown. At 1600 they dug in for the night at the base of the hill.\r\n\r\nDuring the engagement fifteen to twenty enemy bunkers were observed on\r\neach side of the ridge and four machine guns were definitely spotted. A\r\nnight infiltration party armed with hand grenades, rifles, and knives\r\nwas sent to knock out these bunkers. It destroyed two machine guns\r\nand killed four Japanese.\r\n\r\nAt 0730 on the morning of 13 December, the 2d Squadron, 7th Cavalry,\r\nmoved out and came under fire from two Japanese machine guns well\r\nemplaced on a cliff. The ridge narrowed to ten feet with sixty-degree\r\nslopes, making forward passage almost impossible. The troops were\r\npinned down. In the meantime, Troop F of the squadron worked south\r\nin an attempt to envelop the rear of the enemy force but was unable\r\nto do so and returned. The 2d Squadron established night perimeters\r\nnear the same positions it had held the previous night.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning the 75-mm. and 105-mm. artillery and the\r\n4.2-inch and 60-mm. mortars began to register heavy fire on the\r\nJapanese strong point. At 1200 Troop G of the 2d Squadron jumped off,\r\nattacking the enemy position frontally while Troop F moved in from\r\nthe rear. Employing flame throwers, Troop G steadily pushed forward\r\nand by 1445 had knocked out four enemy bunkers and destroyed several\r\nmachine guns. Of more importance, it was fifty yards beyond the\r\nenemy front lines. Troop F also continued to advance. By the end of\r\nthe day the enemy force had been rooted off the high ground, and the\r\n2d Squadron, 7th Cavalry, was in firm possession of the ridge. The\r\nunit captured a quantity of enemy ordnance, including 12 light and 3\r\nheavy machine guns, 9 grenade launchers, and 73 rifles, together with\r\nconsiderable quantities of grenades and ammunition. Before the ridge\r\nwas secured, \"over 5000 rounds of artillery fire had been placed on\r\n[the] ... position without appreciably affecting it.\" [775]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 96th Division\r\n\r\nBy the end of October the XXIV Corps, having secured the southern\r\npart of Leyte Valley, the Dulag-Burauen-Dagami-Tanauan road net,\r\nand all airfields in the area, was ready for the next phase of its\r\nmission. General Hodge thereupon immediately initiated operations\r\nwhereby the XXIV Corps was to liberate southern Leyte concurrently with\r\nthe drive of the X Corps in the north. General Hodge's plan called\r\nfor the 96th Division to make a holding attack east of the mountains\r\nwhile the 7th Division drove north from Baybay up the coast of Ormoc\r\nBay. [776] (See Map 2.) He therefore ordered the 96th Division to\r\ndefend the Tanauan-Dagami-Burauen-Dulag area and to relieve as rapidly\r\nas possible all elements of the 7th Division in the area. Finally it\r\nwas to mop up all enemy forces in its zone and to furnish security for\r\nall the principal roads and installations in the area. [777] General\r\nBradley on 2 November ordered Colonel Dill's 382d Infantry to relieve\r\nthe 17th Infantry of the 7th Division in the vicinity of Dagami, to\r\nsend strong reconnaissance and combat patrols into the hills to the\r\nwest and northwest, and to destroy all enemy forces encountered. [778]\r\n\r\nGeneral Suzuki was desirous of pushing through to Leyte Valley,\r\none of the best entrances to which was through the Dagami sector. At\r\nthe foot of the central mountain range, Dagami was the center of a\r\nnetwork of roads that led to all parts of Leyte Valley and to the\r\nairfields. Since it was one of the key positions for control of\r\nthe valley, its recapture would be of great advantage to the 35th\r\nArmy. Just west of Dagami, the central mountain range served as a\r\nnatural fortification. The mountains consisted of a series of ridges\r\nseparated by deep gorges which were usually covered with a dense\r\ntropical growth. At key points in the area, the 16th Division had\r\nbuilt coconut-log and concrete pillboxes.\r\n\r\nThere were substantial parts of the 9th, 20th, and 33d Infantry\r\nRegiments of the 16th Division in the mountains west of Dagami. In\r\nthe latter part of October the 16th Division became short of food\r\nand General Makino asked that it be supplied by air. The 4th Air Army\r\ntherefore attempted with six light bombers to supply the division, but\r\nfor some unexplained reason it failed. The 16th Division henceforward\r\nwas forced to supply itself and forage off the land. [779]\r\n\r\nOn 2 November the 382d Infantry started to relieve the 17th\r\nInfantry. The 2d Battalion at 1500 relieved the 3d Battalion,\r\n17th Infantry, just north of Dagami and at 1430, the 1st Battalion\r\nrelieved the 1st Battalion, 17th Infantry, about 1,000 yards west of\r\nDagami. [780]\r\n\r\nElements of the 16th Division were entrenched on \"Bloody Ridge,\"\r\na small promontory on the left side of the road west of Dagami just\r\nshort of Hitomnog in front of the 382d Infantry. A waist-deep swampy\r\nrice paddy was between the ridge and the road. The 1st Battalion,\r\n382d Infantry, after moving into this area engaged the enemy, but at\r\nnightfall it broke off the fight and established its night perimeter.\r\n\r\nAt 0805, the 1st Battalion renewed the attack and met increased heavy\r\nresistance as it advanced through the rice paddy. The companies came\r\nunder mortar and automatic weapons fire at 1445 as they came into\r\nthe open.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese took full advantage of the exposed troops and from\r\nmachine guns and mortars delivered heavy fire which immobilized\r\nthe 1st Battalion. The unit was unable to move in any direction\r\nuntil nightfall, when, with the aid of some artillery smoke, the\r\ntroops began to withdraw. \"Men threw away their packs, machine guns,\r\nradios and even rifles. Their sole aim was to crawl back through the\r\nmuck and get on solid ground once more. Some of the wounded gave up\r\nthe struggle to keep their heads above the water and drowned in the\r\ngrasping swamp.\" [781] After every officer in Companies B and C had\r\nbeen killed or wounded, 1st Sgt. Francis H. Thompson took charge and\r\norganized the evacuation. He silenced an enemy machine gun and also\r\nassisted in removal of the wounded. As a result of his leadership\r\nboth companies successfully withdrew and reorganized. [782]\r\n\r\nAt 1745 five enemy planes strafed the battalion. The advance units\r\nof the 1st Battalion withdrew some 300 yards in order to consolidate\r\ntheir defensive positions for the night. During the day Company E of\r\nthe 2d Battalion reached Patok, and Company G moved out at 2100 to\r\nreinforce the 1st Battalion. [783]\r\n\r\nDuring the night of 3-4 November the 16th Division launched a strong\r\ncounterattack of an estimated two-company strength against the\r\nperimeter of the 1st Battalion. Mortar and artillery fires repulsed\r\nthe assault. There was no further enemy activity during the night. On\r\nthe morning of 4 November the 1st Battalion moved out against light\r\nresistance, advancing about 800 yards and past the scene of the bitter\r\nfighting of the previous day. Colonel Dill ordered the 2d Battalion\r\n(minus Company E) and one platoon from Company G to move west from\r\nDagami and join the 1st Battalion. The 2d Battalion joined close behind\r\nthe 1st Battalion in a column. At 1430 the 1st Battalion encountered\r\nincreased enemy resistance and committed its reserve company on the\r\nleft flank. The 2d Battalion received orders from Colonel Dill to move\r\nup to the left flank of the 1st, but the 2d arrived too late for the\r\ntwo battalions to launch a co-ordinated assault before nightfall. They\r\ntherefore consolidated their positions for the night, having advanced\r\nabout 1,000 yards. [784]\r\n\r\nThe night of 4-5 November was not quiet. The Japanese delivered\r\nharassing fire on the 1st Battalion, and at 2205 elements of the 16th\r\nDivision launched a heavy assault against the perimeter of the 2d\r\nBattalion. An artillery concentration immediately stopped the attack,\r\nand the Japanese fled, leaving 254 dead and wounded behind them.\r\n\r\nThe following morning, after the artillery had fired a preparation\r\nin front of the 1st and 2d Battalions, the two battalions renewed the\r\nattack at 0900 and two companies from the 3d Battalion protected the\r\nregimental left (south) flank. The battalions advanced about 1,000\r\nyards before they encountered any strong resistance. The defenses of\r\nthe 16th Division consisted of a great many concrete emplacements,\r\nconcealed spider holes, and connecting trenches. By nightfall,\r\nat 1700, the two battalions, assisted by the tanks from Company A,\r\n763d Tank Battalion, successfully reduced the enemy to their front\r\nand captured the ridge. Each battalion formed its own perimeter and\r\nmade plans to renew the attack on 6 November. [785]\r\n\r\nAt 0830 the 1st Battalion, with light tanks in support, moved\r\nout in the attack westward against a strong enemy force that was\r\nwell entrenched in foxholes and pillboxes. Each of these defensive\r\npositions had to be reduced before the advance could continue. At 1300\r\nthe 2d Battalion moved to the high ground on the right flank of the\r\n1st. The 1st Battalion encountered a strong concrete enemy pillbox\r\nwhich was believed to be a command post, since there were no firing\r\napertures. As grenades had no effect it became necessary finally\r\nto neutralize the pillbox by pouring gasoline down the ventilation\r\npipes and setting it afire. Two officers and nineteen enlisted men\r\nof the enemy were killed in the pillbox. The Japanese continued to\r\nfight tenaciously. There was no withdrawal, but by the end of the\r\nday only isolated pockets of enemy resistance remained. [786]\r\n\r\nThe Japanese 16th Division was taking a bad beating. Its supply of\r\nprovisions had run out. All the battalion commanders, most of the\r\ncompany commanders, and half the artillery battalion and battery\r\ncommanders had been killed. On the night of 6 November the 16th\r\nDivision contracted its battle lines and on the following day took\r\nup a new position in the Dagami area. The new position ranged from\r\na hill about four and a half miles northwest of Dagami to a point\r\nabout three and three-fourths miles northwest of Burauen. [787]\r\n\r\nOn 7 November all three battalions of the 382d Infantry engaged the\r\nenemy and maintained constant pressure against his positions. The\r\n1st and 3d Battalions advanced west, while the 2d Battalion drove\r\nnorth and west. The 3d Battalion encountered the more determined\r\nresistance. Advancing, preceded by tanks, it met heavy enemy machine\r\ngun and rifle fire. A large enemy force assaulted the troops at\r\nclose quarters and tried to destroy the tanks, but when the 382d\r\nInfantry introduced flame throwers and supporting machine guns, the\r\nattackers fell back in disorder. The regiment overran the Japanese\r\ndefensive positions and killed an estimated 474 of the enemy. [788]\r\nCompany E of the 2d Battalion had remained in the Patok area, engaged\r\nin patrolling and wiping out isolated pockets of enemy resistance.\r\n\r\nOn 8 November strong patrols from the 1st and 2d Battalions probed\r\nwest into the hills. They encountered the left flank of the enemy\r\nsupporting position at a point about 2,600 yards west of Patok. A very\r\nheavy rainfall on the night of 8-9 November made an assault against\r\nthe position impossible on 9 November. After all-night artillery fire,\r\nthe 1st and 3d Battalions moved out at 0900 on 10 November. They met\r\nno resistance, but progress was slow because of the swamps. By 1225\r\nthe two battalions, supported by a platoon of light tanks, occupied\r\nthe ridge formerly held by elements of the 16th Division. The 1st\r\nBattalion had advanced 2,500 yards. [789] The 382d Infantry had\r\ndestroyed all organized enemy resistance in its sector and removed\r\nthe threat to Dagami.\r\n\r\nBy this time General Krueger was devoting the main effort of the\r\nSixth Army toward preventing the 35th Army from debouching into Leyte\r\nValley. The 96th Division received orders from General Hodge to halt\r\nthe relief of the 7th Division and to move north to the Jaro-Palo road\r\nand secure the mountain entrances in that sector. The 7th Division was\r\nto relieve the 96th Division on the Dagami-Burauen road. A regiment\r\nwas also to be made available for immediate motor movement to the\r\nnorth and another for a proposed operation on northern Mindanao. [790]\r\n\r\nThe 96th Division moved to the mountains northwest of Dagami and sent\r\nextensive patrols into the central mountain range along a ten-mile\r\nline that extended from Dagami to Jaro. Constant small contacts with\r\nthe enemy continued until the end of the campaign. The 7th Division\r\npatrolled the Burauen area.\r\n\r\nThe Sixth Army had prevented the Japanese from debouching into Leyte\r\nValley. The X Corps had secured Limon, the entrance to Ormoc Valley,\r\nand was in a position to drive south down the valley to the port of\r\nOrmoc. Although General Krueger's troops had performed well, they\r\nhad made mistakes which gave their commander serious concern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nMeasure of the Fighting\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the latter part of November, the fighting on the island had entered\r\na crucial stage. The additional troops received from General MacArthur\r\nhad enabled General Krueger to put into effect his squeeze play against\r\nthe Japanese. While the X Corps continued to apply unremitting pressure\r\non the 1st and 102d Divisions in the northern mountains of Ormoc Valley\r\nnear Limon, elements of the XXIV Corps would drive north against the\r\n26th Division along the shores of Ormoc Bay toward Ormoc.\r\n\r\nGeneral MacArthur had full confidence in the ability of General\r\nKrueger to carry out this plan and thus bring the Leyte Campaign to a\r\nsuccessful conclusion. Once having given the Sixth Army commander the\r\nassignment for the operation, General MacArthur did not interfere with\r\nGeneral Krueger's prosecution of the battle. But from his headquarters\r\non Leyte, he closely followed the progress of the campaign, frequently\r\nvisited the command posts of the Sixth Army units, and made available\r\nto General Krueger additional troops upon request.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, General Krueger allowed his corps commanders to exercise\r\ntheir independence of judgment and kept his orders to the minimum. He,\r\ntoo, made frequent visits to the front lines, observed the progress of\r\nthe fighting, inspected the living conditions of the men, and noted\r\nthe status of the construction program. General Krueger's concern is\r\nmade evident by a critique issued on 25 November in which he analyzed\r\nthe performance of the Sixth Army on Leyte. [791]\r\n\r\nThe Americans had had time to test their experience on Leyte against\r\npast operations, as well as to determine the good and bad features of\r\ntheir training and tactics and the performance of their weapons and\r\nto contrast them with those employed by the Japanese. An evaluation\r\nof American methods at this point serves to explain in concrete terms\r\nthe nature of the fighting that had occurred and of that which would\r\noccur in the critical days ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American Ground Forces\r\n\r\nTactics\r\n\r\nFollowing the customary procedure, the divisions went ashore with\r\ntwo regiments abreast. Within the regiments there were variations,\r\nsome going ashore with the battalions abreast and others with the\r\nbattalions in column. The size of the landing beach and the nature\r\nof the expected opposition determined the type of landing formation\r\nthat was employed. Once ashore, the nature of the tactical situation\r\nresulted in numerous independent actions by subordinate units. The\r\nformation most frequently used was the normal one of two units in\r\nthe assault and one in reserve.\r\n\r\nFrontal assaults were usually employed against enemy positions, and\r\nnot enough use was made of envelopments. When envelopments were tried\r\nthey were nearly always successful. It was sometimes advantageous to\r\nbypass isolated enemy strong points, leaving them to be mopped up by\r\nthe follow-up units.\r\n\r\nAlthough the primary mission of the infantry is to close with\r\nthe enemy and destroy or capture him, the natural reluctance of\r\nAmerican infantrymen to engage the enemy in close quarters had to be\r\novercome. There were several instances in which the American attacking\r\nforce felt out the Japanese position and then sat back to wait it\r\nout. In one area no progress was made for four days. On several\r\noccasions strong combat patrols of platoon or company strength were\r\nsent to feel out enemy positions, but as soon as they made contact with\r\nthe Japanese the patrols withdrew. They accomplished nothing except\r\nto determine the presence of an unknown number of enemy soldiers.\r\n\r\nIf more than minor resistance was encountered, the troops frequently\r\nfell back and called for fire from supporting weapons. On one occasion\r\na company called for artillery fire upon a roadblock and then withdrew\r\n350 yards while the concentration was delivered. After the lifting of\r\nthe artillery fire, it was very difficult to reorganize the company\r\nand get it back to the objective. Meanwhile the Japanese had again\r\ncovered the roadblock and the whole process had to be repeated.\r\n\r\nThe American soldiers were too road-bound. Sometimes resistance\r\nalong the road stopped the advance of an entire division. This\r\nopposition could have been eliminated quickly by the employment of\r\nsimple envelopments and flanking attacks. Although the presence of\r\nswamps, jungle, and rice paddies tended to channelize the attack,\r\nthe Japanese had displayed superior adeptness, and willingness to go\r\ninto the swamps and stay there until rooted out.\r\n\r\nThe standard employment of artillery in close support of the infantry\r\nagain proved to be very effective and was used extensively. However,\r\nsince the artillery fire enabled the infantry to secure many heavily\r\nfortified positions with few casualties, the infantrymen tended to\r\nbecome too dependent upon the artillerymen and expected them to do\r\nthe work of the infantry. General Krueger insisted that the infantry\r\nmust be prepared to close in immediately after the cessation of the\r\nartillery fire.\r\n\r\nThe Americans had developed a strong tendency to telegraph their\r\npunches. In the morning, before an assault by the infantry, the\r\nartillery pounded the Japanese positions, after which the mortars\r\nopened up. The mortar fire nearly always lasted for a half hour, and\r\nthen the infantry moved out. Upon occasion, the infantry did not attack\r\nimmediately after the preparation by the supporting weapons. This\r\ndelay gave the Japanese time and opportunity to regroup and consolidate\r\ntheir forces, and thus nullified the effects of the preparatory fires.\r\n\r\nParenthetically, it may be remarked that although the actual\r\ncasualties per artillery shell were few, the cumulative effect of\r\nthe heavy and prolonged fire of the artillery and mortars was very\r\ngreat. Col. Junkichi Okabayashi, chief of staff of the Japanese\r\n1st Division, estimated that the losses sustained by the division\r\nwere distributed as follows: by artillery, 60 percent; by mortars,\r\n25 percent; by infantry fire, 14 percent; and by aircraft, 1\r\npercent. [792]\r\n\r\nThe employment of tanks singly, or in small groups, materially\r\naided the infantrymen, since the tanks could be used effectively to\r\nreduce enemy pillboxes and to flush out bamboo thickets. Although\r\nlight tanks were more mobile it was found that the mediums were more\r\nefficient in reducing pillboxes. For successful employment, it was\r\nnecessary that the tanks have close infantry and engineer support. In\r\nsome instances the tanks secured objectives when no infantrymen were\r\npresent to consolidate and hold the positions. For example, a regiment\r\nsupported by a tank battalion received orders to attack and secure an\r\nobjective. The tanks quickly moved out and secured the objective with\r\nlittle resistance. Since the infantrymen did not arrive during the\r\nday, the tanks withdrew at nightfall. During the night the Japanese\r\nmined the area and four of the tanks were lost when they returned\r\nnext morning.\r\n\r\nLikewise, tanks were often disabled because the engineers had failed\r\nto remove mines and give support in the crossing of streams. In one\r\ncase, the engineers failed to repair a bridge, which collapsed after\r\nthree tanks had crossed over it. The Japanese completely destroyed\r\none of the tanks and disabled the other two. It was necessary for\r\nthe Americans to destroy the disabled tanks with their own gunfire\r\nin order to prevent their use as stationary pillboxes by the enemy.\r\n\r\nIt was found advantageous to establish a night perimeter before\r\ndusk. An early establishment of the perimeter enabled the troops\r\nto take effective countermeasures against Japanese infiltrations\r\nand night assaults. [793] The soldiers also had an opportunity to\r\nbecome familiar with their surroundings and were less likely to fire\r\nindiscriminately during the night. In spite of this precaution,\r\nthere was considerable promiscuous firing during the night and at\r\ndawn. One corps commander effectively stopped this practice in his\r\ncommand post area by the adoption of two simple measures. First,\r\nhe employed a reserve battalion to cover an area extending outward\r\nfor one mile and when no Japanese were found the fact was announced\r\nover the loudspeaker. Second, any man caught firing before dawn was\r\nimmediately court-martialed and fined fifty dollars. \"There was very\r\nlittle promiscuous firing thereafter.\" [794]\r\n\r\nAlthough there were three war-dog platoons available for the Leyte\r\noperation, their combat value was practically nil. The unit commanders\r\nto whom they were attached knew little of their capabilities or\r\nlimitations. Some expected the dogs to spot a Japanese position\r\nexactly at a distance of 200 or more yards. One unit took the dogs\r\non a four-day patrol without sufficient dog rations. Another unit\r\nattempted to use dogs in a populated area; the presence of so many\r\ncivilians thoroughly confused the dogs.\r\n\r\nIn general, the troops found that their training had been sound and\r\nthat the methods which in the past had been employed in overcoming the\r\nJapanese were also useful on Leyte. It was felt, however, that greater\r\nemphasis in training should be placed on night patrols and night\r\nmovements near the enemy lines, as well as on closer co-ordination\r\nbetween the infantry and the supporting weapons. Finally, it was\r\nbelieved that the service troops should be given training in basic\r\ninfantry tactics and prepared to maintain their own defenses. [795]\r\n\r\nAll units were in agreement that there could be \"no substitute for\r\naggressive leadership.\" [796] An infantry unit could be no better\r\nthan its leaders. General Krueger said in this connection:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Infantry is the arm of close combat. It is the arm of final\r\n    combat. The Jap is usually most tenacious particularly when in\r\n    entrenched and concealed positions. Individual enemy soldiers will\r\n    remain in their holes until eliminated. Although the supporting\r\n    arms are of great assistance, it ultimately becomes the task of\r\n    the small infantry units to dig them out. The American soldier\r\n    has demonstrated on many battlefields that he can and will do it,\r\n    but he must be aggressively led. There can be no hesitating on\r\n    the part of his leaders. [797]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWelfare of the Men\r\n\r\nAt the same time, in order to obtain the best results from the troops,\r\nthe unit commanders must concern themselves with the well-being\r\nand comfort of their men. Many commanders were indifferent to such\r\nmatters. One corps, for example, had sufficient rations of all\r\ntypes available, but the meals served the men were poorly prepared\r\nand monotonous. Another corps, at the time it landed, was prepared\r\nto live indefinitely on field rations. As late as ten days after the\r\nlanding, no unit--not even any of the fixed installations, including\r\nhigher headquarters--operated a mess or served hot meals. Some units\r\ndid serve hot coffee after the first few days.\r\n\r\nAlthough there was considerable rain and mud, few units made a genuine\r\neffort to get their men under shelter even when the tactical situation\r\npermitted. Night after night, officers and men slept in wet foxholes\r\neven when no enemy troops were within shooting distance. \"It must never\r\nbe forgotten,\" said General Krueger, \"that the individual soldier\r\nis the most important single factor in this war.... He is expected\r\nto do a lot including risking his life. But to get the most out of\r\nhim he must have the feeling that everything possible under existing\r\ncircumstances is being done for his well being and comfort. This is\r\na prime responsibility of command....\" [798]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeapons and Vehicles\r\n\r\nThe basic weapons--the U.S. .30-caliber rifle Model 1903, the\r\nU.S. .30-caliber rifle M1, the BAR, bayonets, and grenades--with which\r\nthe rifle squads and the individual soldiers of the heavy weapons\r\ncompany were equipped were generally satisfactory and notably superior\r\nto comparable weapons of the Japanese.\r\n\r\nThe troops used a variety of hand grenades. The white smoke grenade\r\nwas considered to be defective and was frequently discarded. The white\r\nphosphorus grenade was extensively used, mainly as an antipersonnel\r\nweapon. It was thrown with telling effect into foxholes, caves,\r\nand heavy underbrush. An Australian grenade was introduced, but\r\nbecause the troops were unfamiliar with its use, it was not too\r\nsuccessful. Incendiary hand grenades were effectively used against\r\nenemy weapons, ammunition dumps, and supplies. Colored grenades were\r\nemployed to mark strips for the air dropping of supplies. [799] The\r\nfragmentation grenade was most favored by the troops, and after that\r\nthe phosphorus grenade. [800]\r\n\r\nThe Browning automatic rifle was very popular, the best results being\r\nobtained when two were allotted to a squad. The increased fire power\r\nthus obtained was very effective in night defense.\r\n\r\nThe 81-mm. mortar continued to be highly esteemed as a close support\r\ninfantry weapon. The 4.2-inch chemical mortars of the attached chemical\r\nmortar battalions were extensively employed, affording excellent\r\nresults when emplaced on firm ground. On marshy or swampy ground,\r\nhowever, their base plates would sink and cause inaccurate firing\r\nor put the weapons out of commission. The most popular mortar was\r\nthe 60-mm., which was very mobile and especially suitable for use in\r\nclose terrain. This mortar fired an illuminating shell which was used\r\nconstantly for night defense, but its base plate also tended to sink\r\ninto the ground.\r\n\r\nFlame throwers were employed with very good effect in reducing strongly\r\nfortified positions. The M2-2 flame thrower was an excellent incendiary\r\nweapon against bamboo thickets and shacks. The cartridge type was\r\nconsidered to be more satisfactory, since the spark-ignited flame\r\nthrower was not dependable in rainy weather. The flame thrower was\r\nconsidered \"a very important factor in overcoming the enemy's inherent\r\n'will to resist.'\" [801]\r\n\r\nThe .50-caliber machine gun again proved its value in defense,\r\nbeing highly effective not only against ground targets but also\r\nagainst aircraft. The 96th Division found the Thompson submachine gun\r\nexcellent for use by patrolling units but \"some difficulty ... has\r\nbeen encountered with the M3 machine gun in its failure to feed\r\nproperly.\" [802]\r\n\r\nThe 7th Division found the 75-mm. self-propelled howitzer, because of\r\nits superior mobility, to be the most effective infantry weapon for\r\nreduction of Japanese pillboxes. The 105-mm. howitzers of the field\r\nartillery battalions again proved their worth by the speed, accuracy,\r\nand effectiveness of their fire. The greater striking range of the\r\n155-mm. howitzer had special value for general support missions.\r\n\r\nDemolition charges were used effectively by patrols for the destruction\r\nof enemy ammunition dumps in inaccessible locations and not salvageable\r\nbecause of the tactical situation. Except for this purpose, demolitions\r\nwere not extensively used. [803]\r\n\r\nThe 37-mm. gun was an antitank weapon only occasionally employed by the\r\n7th Division because there were few Japanese armored vehicles against\r\nwhich to use it. The excessive difficulty of manhandling it into a\r\nposition from which fire could be delivered against Japanese pillboxes\r\nand machine guns rendered it ineffective for that purpose. The\r\n90-mm. guns of the antiaircraft artillery had a considerable number\r\nof erratic bursts because of corroded fuzes and worn fuze setting lugs.\r\n\r\nThe tanks and tank destroyers could have been used more frequently\r\nand with greater versatility. Situations often arose in which an\r\ninfantry platoon was held up by enemy machine gun and mortar fire,\r\nbut \"the use of indirect artillery fire was impracticable either\r\nbecause of overhead cover for the enemy weapons or because of undue\r\nrisk to our enveloping infantry.\" General Krueger recommended that the\r\ninfantry employ direct fire by the tanks or tank destroyers. He felt\r\nthat \"the tank destroyer commanders lacked aggressiveness and skilled\r\ndirection.\" [804] The tank destroyer commanders admitted that they were\r\nidle but added that the infantry had not called for them. The tanks and\r\ntank destroyers were ideal weapons for the destruction of machine guns,\r\nmortars, and other heavy infantry weapons, but the infantry commanders\r\nseemed to be unaware of their capabilities. Many commanders employed\r\ntheir armored vehicles down the middle of the road when they could\r\nhave used them more effectively on the flanks and for envelopments.\r\n\r\nThe 96th Division found the Cannon Company's self-propelled\r\n105-mm. howitzer extremely mobile in swamps and mountainous\r\nterrain. It was able to go several miles farther up the mountains\r\nthan any other vehicle and gave excellent support in covering the\r\nmountain passes. [805]\r\n\r\nThe cargo carrier M29 (weasel) proved to be a most useful supply\r\nvehicle. The commanders used it for reconnaissance and visits to\r\nunits in isolated areas and over roads that were impassable to\r\nwheeled vehicles. It also was employed to carry supplies and to\r\nevacuate the wounded from inaccessible areas. The weasel was much\r\nless destructive of roads than any of the other tracked vehicles,\r\nbut the tendency to use it on dry roads resulted in worn-out tracks\r\nand excessive maintenance requirements.\r\n\r\nThe 96th Division found the DUKW to be an excellent vehicle when\r\nwaterborne but on land, regardless of the condition of the roads and\r\nterrain, it was not half as effective as the 2 1/2-ton cargo truck. On\r\nroads the DUKW was a traffic hazard and an obstacle to other cargo\r\ntraffic. [806]\r\n\r\nThe 7th Division landed with seventeen one-ton trailers. They were\r\nfound to be of little value and the division recommended that they\r\nshould not be used in any future operation unless a hard-surfaced,\r\nall-weather road net existed at the anticipated target. [807]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntelligence\r\n\r\nGeneral Krueger pointed out that prompt, aggressive reconnaissance\r\nshould have been instituted immediately upon the landing of the\r\ntroops. The fact that knowledge of the terrain was very limited\r\nbefore the assault--inaccuracies in the distances on existing maps\r\nwere as high as 50 percent--gave urgency to the need for immediate\r\nreconnaissance.\r\n\r\nThe sources of information on the Japanese were as follows:\r\nground and aerial reconnaissance, Filipino civilians, guerrillas,\r\ncaptured documents, and prisoners. Air observation was of limited\r\nvalue because of the Japanese ability at camouflage and because the\r\ninclement weather prevented aerial observation of many areas. The\r\ntendency of the Filipinos to say \"yes\" to everything was also a\r\nhandicap. In general, the guerrilla reports were more accurate than\r\nthose of civilians. Considerable information was obtained from patrols,\r\nwhich were especially valuable for on-the-spot intelligence.\r\n\r\nIn interrogating prisoners the best results were obtained by\r\nemploying Nisei, who obtained more information from prisoners when\r\nthe latter were not subjected to questioning by an officer through\r\nan interpreter. Since most of the prisoners had been separated from\r\ntheir units for a considerable time and were seriously wounded,\r\ntheir information was sparse and generally out of date.\r\n\r\nCaptured documents were the most fruitful source of\r\nintelligence. Although the Japanese made a few attempts to destroy\r\ndog tags and other means of identification before going into battle,\r\nthey were not too successful. The fact that General Krueger obtained\r\ninformation on the proposed ground offensive of the Japanese for\r\nthe middle of November from papers found on the body of a Japanese\r\nofficer was not an isolated incident. Many officers carried on their\r\npersons sets of orders and maps.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese received much of their information on the American order\r\nof battle from broadcasts emanating from San Francisco. At first,\r\nthe Japanese on the island were unable to find out the American order\r\nof battle for Leyte but within a few days the Americans gratuitously\r\nfurnished them the information. Said General Tomochika:\r\n\r\n\r\n    At the time of the landing, 35th Army Headquarters did not know\r\n    the number or name of the American units which had landed ... but\r\n    within a day headquarters learned.... We found out ... by tuning\r\n    in on the San Francisco broadcasts; Japanese troops in the combat\r\n    area were unable to determine their identity. From the same\r\n    source, we later obtained information which was of considerable\r\n    help in planning. In fact, that was the only way we could get\r\n    information.... Information was always received through the San\r\n    Francisco broadcast before reports from our front line units\r\n    reached headquarters.... Since the information came much sooner\r\n    from the American broadcast than from the Japanese communications,\r\n    the Army Headquarters depended on the American broadcasts for\r\n    much intelligence. [808]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJapanese Warfare\r\n\r\nThe 24th Division found the Japanese troops on Leyte to be better\r\ntrained in combat and more skillful than those the division had\r\nencountered during the Hollandia-Tanahmerah Bay operation. [809] In\r\ngeneral the Japanese fought a delaying action, and when forced to yield\r\nground they would fall back to previously prepared positions. During\r\na bombardment by American heavy weapons, the enemy troops would\r\nwithdraw but when the fire lifted they would quickly reoccupy the\r\nvacated positions. [810]\r\n\r\nThe 21st Infantry was impressed with the Japanese \"excellence in\r\nbattle\" on Breakneck Ridge. There were few instances of \"reckless\r\ncharges, needless sacrifices or failure to observe known tactical\r\nprinciples.\" The most notable characteristics exhibited were\r\nthe excellent fire discipline and the effective control of all\r\narms. Without exception individual soldiers withheld their fire until\r\nit would have the greatest possible effect. The heaviest firing would\r\ngenerally start about 1530 and increase in intensity until about dark,\r\nthe fire being accompanied by counterattacks from the front and on\r\nthe flanks. These assaults usually came when the Americans' energy\r\nand ammunition were at their lowest point during the day and when\r\nthey would prevent proper consolidation of the front lines before\r\ndark. [811]\r\n\r\nThe Japanese employed reverse slope defense tactics with much\r\nskill and were successful in utilizing terrain for their defensive\r\npositions. Caves and other natural formations were exploited to the\r\nlimit and positions were dug in deeply and expertly camouflaged. The\r\nJapanese frequently sacrificed fields of fire for cover and\r\nconcealment, a fact which made it very difficult for the Americans\r\nto locate hostile positions.\r\n\r\nCaptured documents indicated that the Japanese attacks were generally\r\nwell conceived but that there were not enough troops at the time of\r\nthe assault. The documents also gave repeated indications that units\r\neither did not receive their orders or did not reach the appointed\r\nplace on time. The Japanese employed two main types of attack. The\r\nfirst, which was similar to that employed by the Americans, utilized\r\na base of fire from supporting weapons, followed by infantry fire and\r\nmovement. This type of attack was not usually accompanied by artillery\r\nor mortar support. The other method consisted of a localized charge\r\nin which the Japanese by sheer force of numbers tried to crack the\r\nAmerican lines. The heavy weapons fire of the Americans was nearly\r\nalways able to break up both types of attack. Enemy forces, generally\r\nin small numbers, tried repeatedly to infiltrate through the American\r\nlines. The objectives were artillery pieces, supply dumps, and key\r\ninstallations. Rarely did they accomplish even minor damage.\r\n\r\nArtillery weapons were seldom used by the Japanese to maximum\r\neffect. The gunnery techniques were \"remarkably undeveloped\"\r\nand inefficient, the pieces being used singly or in pairs and only\r\nrarely as batteries. Their fire was never massed. The gun positions\r\ngenerally were well constructed but they were frequently selected\r\nwith such high regard for concealment that the fields of fire were\r\nlimited. The use of mines and demolition charges was poor, the mine\r\nfields being hastily and obviously laid.\r\n\r\nThe troops were well trained and led by officers imbued with a sense\r\nof duty. Consequently, \"as long as any officers remain alive, the\r\nremnants of a ... force are capable of determined action.\" [812]\r\n\r\nThe Japanese view of American methods was summed up by General\r\nTomochika as follows: \"The strong points of the American strategy\r\nin the Leyte Operation were numerous but the two outstanding points\r\nwere (1) the overwhelming striking power of the American Army, and\r\n(2) the American operations were planned in minute detail and on the\r\nwhole were carried out scrupulously.\" [813]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nBattle of the Ridges\r\n\r\n\r\nAmerican Plans and Preparations\r\n\r\nWith the securing of the beachhead areas in the last week of October\r\nand the first days of November, General Krueger was ready to launch\r\nthat part of his plan that concerned a drive north along the west\r\ncoast of Leyte. Since a preliminary reconnaissance indicated that\r\nthere were not a great many Japanese troops in the southern half of the\r\nisland, elements of the 32d Infantry had already started to push west\r\nthrough the mountains to the west coast along the road from Abuyog to\r\nBaybay. After the attention of the Japanese had been diverted to the\r\nstruggle in the northern mountains, the X Corps could launch a drive\r\nagainst Ormoc, proceeding north from Baybay on Highway 2 along the\r\nshores of the Camotes Sea and of Ormoc Bay. At the same time elements\r\nof the X Corps--the 24th Division and later the 32d Division--could\r\ndrive down the Ormoc corridor to Ormoc. The enemy forces would then\r\nbe caught between the jaws of a trap, with their freedom of maneuver\r\nlimited and most of their strength employed in defensive action. But\r\nthe need for blocking the exits from the central mountain range and\r\nthe scarcity of combat troops made it necessary for General Krueger\r\nto postpone sending a strong force to the shores of the Camotes Sea\r\nuntil additional reinforcements arrived on Leyte in the middle of\r\nNovember. General Hodge was to be prepared, however, to send strong\r\nelements of the XXIV Corps over the mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmerican Plans\r\n\r\nOn 30 October General Hodge directed the 7th Division to move elements,\r\nnot to exceed one battalion, over the mountain road from Abuyog to\r\nBaybay, the western terminus of the road. He also ordered the 7th\r\nDivision to be prepared to move to the west coast when relieved in the\r\nBurauen area. [814] In anticipation of this plan, the 2d Battalion,\r\n32d Infantry, had moved to Abuyog on 29 October to occupy and defend\r\nthat area. Company G had spearheaded the advance to Baybay. On 2\r\nNovember General Arnold alerted the main body of the 32d Infantry,\r\nunder Colonel Finn, for a move to Abuyog.\r\n\r\nAs soon as word was received that the Americans were on the west coast,\r\nGeneral Suzuki, believing these forces to be a small unit of American\r\nand Philippine troops, sent a company from the 364th Battalion south\r\nfrom Ormoc to hold Albuera until the 26th Division could arrive. [815]\r\nAlbuera was important tactically, since from it ran a mountain trail\r\nthat the Japanese had tried unsuccessfully to develop into a road to\r\nthe Burauen airfield in Leyte Valley.\r\n\r\nOn 9 November the 26th Division landed at Ormoc after a rough voyage\r\nfrom Manila. The transport vessels had been repeatedly attacked by\r\nAllied aircraft, which damaged many of the landing barges and ship\r\nhatches. These damaging attacks hindered the unloading of equipment,\r\nwhich did not proceed as planned. Many of the landing barges were run\r\naground and destroyed by Allied aircraft, and the transports were\r\nforced to sail away before being completely emptied. They carried\r\nmost of the ordnance, provisions, and munitions of the division with\r\nthem. On their return trip, all the vessels were sunk by aircraft. The\r\ndivision consequently came ashore underequipped. The strength of\r\nthe 26th Division consisted of Division Headquarters, one battalion\r\nof the 11th Independent Infantry Regiment, three battalions of the\r\n13th Independent Infantry Regiment, and the 2d Battalion of the 12th\r\nInfantry Regiment. These units had only light, portable weapons,\r\nand none was equipped with machine guns except a battalion of the\r\n13th Independent Infantry Regiment.\r\n\r\nGeneral Suzuki had intended to use the 26th Division in the Carigara\r\narea but the arrival of American forces in the Baybay area forced him\r\nto change his plans. On 13 November he received word from Manila that\r\nthe 26th Division was to be used in the Burauen area and consequently\r\nthe main force of the 26th Division was directed to Albuera. General\r\nSuzuki first sent the 13th Independent Infantry Regiment, under\r\nCol. Jiro Saito, [816] but eventually the entire 26th Division,\r\nincluding the division headquarters, was committed to the Albuera area.\r\n\r\nAs the troops of the 2d Battalion, 32d Infantry, moved over the\r\nmountains to Baybay, guerrillas informed them that about three\r\nhundred Japanese soldiers were pushing south toward the Abuyog-Baybay\r\nroad. These enemy troops were \"six marauding units\" of the company\r\nwhich had been sent south to make contact with the American forces\r\nand contain them until the 26th Division could arrive. [817] Company\r\nE set up an ambush, killed many of the Japanese, and forced the others\r\nto disperse.\r\n\r\nBy this time the appearance of Japanese reinforcements going north from\r\nOrmoc caused General Krueger to shift the weight of the Sixth Army to\r\nthe north to meet the new threat, and to order General Hodge to hold up\r\non the relief of the 7th Division in the Burauen area. It was not until\r\nafter the arrival of the 11th Airborne Division that the 7th Division,\r\non 22 November, was able to move in force to the west coast. [818]\r\n\r\nAt 1025 on 14 November General Arnold ordered Colonel Finn to start\r\nmoving the 32d Infantry north to the Damulaan-Caridad area and to be\r\nprepared to advance upon Ormoc on further orders. [819] The units of\r\nthe 32d Infantry moved to their assigned areas near the Palanas River,\r\nand both the Japanese and Americans made ready their positions for\r\nthe clash. (Map 15) The battle that was about to be fought over the\r\nridge lines along the Palanas River was later called the \"Battle of\r\nShoestring Ridge\" by troops of the 32d Infantry. This name applied\r\nto the supply technique rather than to any terrain features of the\r\nridge, since the supply of the 32d Infantry throughout the battle\r\nwas precarious. Said Colonel Finn: \"The old slogan 'Too little and\r\ntoo late' became 'Just enough and just in time' for us.\" [820]\r\n\r\nThe Palanas River runs in a southwesterly direction between two ridges\r\nthat end abruptly on reaching the road. The ridges slope sharply toward\r\nthe river and are separated by a narrow valley. Colonel Finn chose to\r\nstand on Shoestring Ridge, the southernmost of the two, which rises\r\nsteeply from the fields. Its northerly face drops precipitately for\r\nmore than 125 feet to the valley, where dense bamboo thickets cover\r\nthe river banks. The main body of the ridge is covered with cogon\r\ngrass, interspersed with palms and bamboo, growth being especially\r\nheavy in the gullies. Between the western tip of the ridge and the\r\nsea are rice paddies and clusters of palm trees, while at a point\r\n3,000 yards northeast of the road the ridge falls into a saddle and\r\nthen rises to join Hill 918.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOffensive Preparations\r\n\r\nWhile the 26th Division was building up positions on the opposite\r\nbank of the Palanas River, Colonel Finn had to solve problems that\r\nexisted to the rear. Since enemy barges still operated freely a few\r\nthousand yards offshore and two Japanese destroyers had cruised by,\r\nGeneral Arnold thought that the enemy might try to land forces and\r\nseize Baybay in order to separate the American units and sever their\r\nline of communications. There were only three infantry battalions on\r\nthe west coast. The mud and floods on the narrow route that connected\r\nthis force with the source of supplies at Dulag, on the east coast,\r\nmade the road so undependable that the 7th Division could not rely\r\non a quick transfer of reinforcements to the west.\r\n\r\nLt. Col. Charles A. Whitcomb's 3d Battalion, 32d Infantry, had\r\nmoved from Baybay to a position just south of the 2d Battalion on\r\n21 November [821] and established defensive positions in depth. To\r\nhave increased the defensive strength on Shoestring Ridge would\r\nhave placed the bulk of the forces in a position where they would\r\nbe surrounded if the Japanese breached their line. General Arnold,\r\nto prevent such an envelopment, directed that the 2d Battalion, 184th\r\nInfantry, should not be used to reinforce the front lines without his\r\npermission. [822] This order left only Lt. Col. Glenn A. Nelson's\r\n2d Battalion, 32d Infantry, to hold the front. The 1st Battalion\r\nhad been sent to the vicinity of Panaon Strait to relieve the 21st\r\nInfantry. In addition to the infantry there was a concentration of\r\nartillery at Damulaan for support. Batteries A and B of the 49th Field\r\nArtillery Battalion (105-mm. howitzer) had moved up and registered\r\nfire by 21 November, [823] and on the morning of 23 November Battery\r\nB of the 11th 155-mm. Marine Gun Battalion arrived at Damulaan. [824]\r\nThe regimental Cannon Company brought two more pieces, which boosted\r\nthe total to fourteen. All the artillery pieces were only about 1,500\r\nyards behind the front lines, concentrated in a small area in the\r\nvicinity of Damulaan. The light weapons were situated so that their\r\nfire could be placed as far forward as possible, and the 155-mm. guns\r\nwere in positions from which they could shell Ormoc. [825] The defenses\r\nof the infantry and the artillery were consolidated on ground that\r\nafforded the best protection.\r\n\r\nA platoon from the 7th Reconnaissance Troop patrolled the road between\r\nBaybay and Damulaan, and a platoon of light tanks from the 767th Tank\r\nBattalion at Damulaan was the only armor on the west coast. [826]\r\n\r\nFor several days preceding the 23d of November, Filipinos moving to\r\nthe south through the lines reported that large enemy forces were\r\nmassing on the opposite side of the Palanas River and emplacing field\r\nguns. Artillery observers on Shoestring Ridge could see the Japanese\r\nconstructing trenches, machine gun pits, and other installations on\r\nthe opposite ridge. The Japanese forces consisted of the 1st and 2d\r\nBattalions, 13th Independent Infantry Regiment, and two battalions\r\nfrom the 11th and 12th Independent Infantry Regiments. [827] Colonel\r\nSaito was ordered to hold back the American advance, which threatened\r\nto cut off a trail the Japanese had been building at Albuera over\r\nthe mountains to Burauen.\r\n\r\nOn 23 November the defenses of the 32d Infantry were stretched very\r\nthin. Because of the great distance involved it was not possible to\r\nhave a continuous front line extending from the sea to the mountains,\r\nand therefore some passages of approach had to be left open to the\r\nenemy. Only the longest and most difficult were undefended. [828]\r\nThe main defensive sector of the 32d Infantry, just south of the\r\nPalanas River, was astride the highway and on that part of the\r\nridge which overlooked the regiment's artillery and command post\r\ninstallations. The defensive sector of Companies F and G was 1,500\r\nyards in width. Company F occupied the flat, marshy land between\r\nthe sea and the hills to the east. The men built barricades of dirt\r\nand sandbags at intervals of seventy-five yards and mined the area\r\nin front of them. Company E and guerrillas of Companies F and G,\r\n94th Philippine Infantry, which were attached to the 2d Battalion,\r\nwere on a ridge that extended to Hill 918. Some guerrillas were also\r\noutposted between Companies G and E. Regimental headquarters was\r\nat Baybay. [829] \"The main strength of the line was American guts\r\nand fighting spirit.\" [830] During the night, Battery B of the 11th\r\n155-mm. Gun Battalion had moved in and was in position at 0800 to start\r\nfiring. The battery was so well camouflaged that during the ensuing\r\nengagement it was never discovered by the enemy. The regiment now had\r\nin support two batteries of 105-mm. howitzers and one of 155-mm. guns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBattle of Shoestring Ridge\r\n\r\nThe Battle Begins\r\n\r\nAt about 1830 on 23 November, the 26th Division opened up the\r\nlong-expected attack. [831] The signal for the commencement of\r\nhostilities was an artillery concentration, the first rounds\r\nof which fell in the area of Battery A, 49th Field Artillery\r\nBattalion. The next rounds were scattered. Enemy mortars joined the\r\nartillery and concentrated their fire on the front lines of the 32d\r\nInfantry. Counterbattery fire of the 105-mm. howitzers from Battery B\r\nof the 49th Field Artillery temporarily silenced the Japanese fire. At\r\n2000 the enemy artillery and mortars again opened up against the front\r\nlines of the 32d Infantry and cut all communications between the 2d\r\nBattalion and the regimental headquarters at Baybay. Communications\r\nwere later re-established by relay from the 3d Battalion at Caridad.\r\n\r\nAt 2100 the Japanese infantry launched a well-planned attack, supported\r\nby artillery, mortars, and machine guns, against the lines of Company\r\nE. Although the company retaliated with all weapons at its command,\r\nthe Japanese continued to come on, despite heavy casualties, through\r\nthe covered draws, high cogon grass, and bamboo thickets. The guerrilla\r\noutpost between Companies G and E withdrew when the Japanese attacked\r\nCompany E. The enemy force, which consisted of two reinforced rifle\r\ncompanies from the 13th Independent Infantry Regiment, seized portions\r\nof the ridge and dug in.\r\n\r\nColonel Nelson, the commander of the 2d Battalion, ordered\r\nCapt. John J. Young, commanding officer of Company E, to withdraw his\r\ntroops. Since the Japanese had penetrated the lines and were digging\r\nin, the withdrawal was difficult. At about 2200, when Capt. Roy\r\nF. Dixon, commanding officer of Company G, received word that Company\r\nE was to withdraw to a position behind Company L and thus leave the\r\nright flank of Company G exposed, he ordered the right platoon leader\r\nto move his right from a position in front of the ridge to one on the\r\nridge facing east, refusing this flank. [832] The two right squads\r\nmoved back and secured the right of Company G.\r\n\r\nAt dawn on 24 November Colonel Nelson re-formed the 2d Battalion. A\r\npatrol from Company F went to the Palanas River and found no enemy\r\ntroops. At 0800 three companies moved to the east toward Hill\r\n918. The troops succeeded in pushing back a Japanese force that had\r\npenetrated south of the Palanas River and east of Hill 918. Colonel\r\nFinn ordered Company K to move up from Caridad, and he attached it\r\nto the 2d Battalion.\r\n\r\nBattery C of the 57th 105-mm. Howitzer Battalion, which had just\r\narrived, was placed on the left, south of the Bucan River. [833] By\r\n1800 the troops had regained some of the ground lost the previous\r\nnight and occupied a perimeter approximately 2,000 yards long and\r\nless than 1,500 yards deep.\r\n\r\nDuring the day, as far as their limited ammunition would allow,\r\nthe artillery units fired at enemy troop concentrations and possible\r\nobservation posts. The service troops worked feverishly to move badly\r\nneeded ammunition to the front lines. The two most critical items\r\nwere 105-mm. and 81-mm. ammunition, and by nightfall the front lines\r\nhad received 1,400 rounds of the first item and 1,600 rounds of the\r\nsecond. General Arnold attached the 1st Battalion, 184th Infantry,\r\nto the 32d Infantry but Colonel Finn was forbidden to commit it to\r\naction without permission from the 7th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJapanese Counterattack\r\n\r\nThe enemy forces did not wait. That night, under a full moon,\r\nthey attacked American positions with great ferocity, opening the\r\nengagement with the heaviest artillery barrage the 32d Infantry had yet\r\nexperienced. [834] The first rounds fell on the front-line troops, but\r\nthe fire then shifted and centered on Battery A, 49th Field Artillery\r\nBattalion, and the infantry and artillery command posts in the rear\r\nat Damulaan. At the same time the enemy pounded the front lines of\r\nCompanies G, L, E, and K with heavy mortar fire. Additional mortars\r\njoined the battle and shifted the greater part of their fire against\r\nBattery B. The cannoneers held fast and returned the fire.\r\n\r\nAfter this thirty-minute artillery and mortar preparation, the Japanese\r\n13th Independent Infantry Regiment attacked the front lines of the\r\nAmericans, concentrating the assault against three main positions:\r\nthe right flank of Company G, the draw between Companies L and K,\r\nand the center of Company K. At the same time, combat patrols moved\r\nfrom the north against Companies F and G. The companies easily threw\r\nback these patrols.\r\n\r\nColonel Nelson ordered all supporting weapons of the 2d Battalion\r\nto fire. All three artillery batteries fired at the maximum rate\r\nfor seven minutes, while the mortars placed their fire directly on\r\nthe assault force in order to chop it up or drive it back into the\r\nartillery fire. Colonel Nelson then put the Ammunition and Pioneer\r\nPlatoon of the 2d Battalion and a squad from Company B, 13th Engineer\r\nBattalion, in previously prepared positions between Companies G and\r\nE. Company G was thus able to strengthen its lines at the heaviest\r\npoint of pressure and repel the frequently repeated assaults.\r\n\r\nAt about 1900 a strong force of the enemy gathered on the ridge in\r\nfront of the right flank of Company L. The American mortars fired\r\non the ridge but the American machine guns kept silent in order to\r\nconceal their locations. A group of about fifty Japanese came to\r\nwithin thirty yards of the right platoon of Company L and showered it\r\nwith grenades. Mortar fire also fell on this platoon, and at the same\r\ntime the platoon of Company K in the draw came under heavy fire. At\r\nleast twelve emplaced machine guns, in addition to those carried up\r\nby the assaulting troops, raked the positions of Companies K and L\r\nwith intense fire. Company L employed all weapons and threw back the\r\nassault with heavy casualties to the Japanese.\r\n\r\nCompany K did not fare so well, since it was operating at little\r\nmore than half strength and there were only nineteen men in the\r\nplatoon that guarded the draw on the company's left flank. Under the\r\nprotection of machine gun and mortar fire, the Japanese moved against\r\nthe platoon, which was ringed by machine gun fire that cut off any\r\navenue of withdrawal. The platoon seemed to be faced with imminent\r\nextermination. A Marine machine gunner from the 11th 155-mm. Gun\r\nBattalion, who was stationed on the high ground just south of the draw\r\nof the besieged platoon, opened fire and knocked out the enemy machine\r\nguns which had cut off the line of withdrawal. He then directed his\r\nfire against the Japanese weapons on the ridge across the draw and\r\nraked the ridge from one end to the other. After the enemy guns had\r\nbeen silenced the platoon made an orderly withdrawal to the foot of\r\nthe ridge to positions on its right rear, from which it could cover\r\nthe draw. [835] Many enemy dead were left in the vacated positions.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese then attempted to break through the center of Company\r\nK's line, but were driven off by the use of artillery, together with\r\nthe mortars, machine guns, grenades, and rifles of the company. For\r\nthe rest of the night the Japanese kept probing the left flank of\r\nthe company and placing machine gun and mortar fire along the entire\r\nline. At one time about twenty-five of the enemy pushed past the outer\r\nperimeter to within fifty yards of the perimeter of the command post\r\nand set up two machine guns. Headquarters personnel, medical men,\r\nand engineers who were manning the perimeter drove the group off.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Japanese forces in front of Company L withdrew and were\r\nregrouping, preparatory to launching a new attack. Since there was\r\nno artillery observer with the company, 1st Lt. William C. Bentley,\r\nof the Cannon Company, with two men went to a vantage point from which\r\nthey could observe the draw and the ridge where the enemy force was\r\nassembling. Lieutenant Bentley directed an artillery concentration on\r\nthe draw. Three times the Japanese tried to pierce the right flank of\r\nCompany L and three times the artillery drove them back with heavy\r\ncasualties. The enemy then tried unsuccessfully to get through the\r\nleft flank of the company. The front line of Company L had comparative\r\nquiet for the rest of the night, except for a few infiltrators.\r\n\r\nHaving failed to pierce the front lines, the 26th Division troops\r\ntried desperately to knock out the artillery supporting the 32d\r\nInfantry--Batteries A and B of the 49th Field Artillery Battalion\r\nreceiving the heaviest blows. Battery B had all four of its guns\r\nknocked out, but by \"cannibalizing\" the damaged guns the battery had\r\none of them back in operation by dawn. The enemy shelling gradually\r\nslackened in intensity, and by 0400, except for occasional outbursts\r\nof fire, all was quiet.\r\n\r\nAt dawn of 25 November each company sent scouting patrols 2,000 yards\r\nto its front in order to forestall any Japanese attempts to move\r\nin. The patrols remained out all day. The front lines were reinforced\r\nby Company I, which moved into the draw between Companies K and L. The\r\ntroops prepared positions but occupied them only at night, since they\r\nwere located in a swampy rice paddy. Headquarters and B Battery of\r\nthe 57th Field Artillery Battalion moved into the Damulaan area to\r\nprovide additional artillery support. Four 105-mm. howitzer batteries\r\nand one 155-mm. gun battery were then available. The troops of the\r\n3d Battalion reverted to the control of the 3d Battalion commander,\r\nColonel Whitcomb. Because of the intense firing during the night,\r\nthe ammunition in the front lines had been nearly exhausted, but a\r\nsufficient supply was brought forward to the guns by the next evening.\r\n\r\nAt 2200 the enemy, using the same tactics as on the previous night,\r\nagain assaulted the eastern positions of the 32d Infantry with\r\napproximately one battalion, after an artillery preparation. Although\r\napparently well led and well organized, they were in less strength\r\nthan before and were driven back, but not without a grenade battle\r\nand some hand-to-hand fighting.\r\n\r\nWhile the infantry troops were thus engaged, eight Japanese led by\r\nan officer moved unnoticed along the Bucan River about one and a half\r\nmiles south of the Palanas River. Coming up on the right of B Battery,\r\n49th Field Artillery Battalion, these enemy troops threw a shower\r\nof grenades at the gun crews and tried to clamber over the river\r\nbank and get at the guns. One man made it, and by placing a satchel\r\ncharge behind the breechblock of a howitzer he put it permanently\r\nout of commission. All of the Japanese were killed.\r\n\r\nThe troops of the 32d Infantry spent the 26th of November improving\r\ntheir positions, moving automatic weapons, restocking ammunition, and\r\nsecuring much-needed rest. The only important change in the lines was\r\nthe moving of B Company, 184th Infantry, less one platoon, into the\r\nposition of B Battery, which was made part of A Battery. [836] (Map 16)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBloody Bamboo Thicket\r\n\r\nAt 2100 Colonel Saito renewed the assault against the American\r\nposition, following the pattern set by the previous night actions. The\r\nJapanese first laid down mortar and machine gun fire, [837] and\r\nthen heavy-weapons fire of the 13th Infantry Regiment hit the\r\nright platoons of Company G, shifting to the east in about fifteen\r\nminutes. Immediately afterward, about a battalion of Japanese infantry\r\nattacked Company G, while twelve machine guns started to fire from\r\na ridge 1,200 yards to the east. The Japanese moved into the fire of\r\ntheir own heavy weapons. The 32d Infantry, using all of its artillery\r\nbatteries, mortars, machine guns, and rifles, started throwing lead\r\nagainst the enemy force as fast as its men could load and fire. The\r\nJapanese, employing an estimated fifty machine guns, continued to\r\ncome on. \"All hell broke loose\" [838] as the enemy shot off flares to\r\nguide their own artillery fire. The sharp declivity in front of the\r\nAmerican lines did not allow for a close concentration of friendly\r\nartillery fire. Just as it appeared that the lines were to be overrun,\r\nsome more enemy flares went up, and the Japanese withdrew, covered\r\nby heavy machine gun and mortar fire. Colonel Finn, taking advantage\r\nof this fortunate circumstance, hastily rearranged riflemen to fill\r\ngaps caused by casualties and replenished his ammunition supplies. The\r\nmortars of the regiment continued to fire into the draw.\r\n\r\nAfter a short lull Colonel Saito renewed the attack. There was\r\nno preparatory artillery fire, but the mortars and machine guns\r\nintroduced the assault. The attack did not seem as determined as the\r\nprevious one, though the number of troops was apparently about the\r\nsame. The 32d Infantry again called down all types of fire upon the\r\nenemy. Elements of the 13th Infantry Regiment continued to advance,\r\nalthough \"the carnage was terrific,\" [839] and attempted to pass\r\nthrough the American lines. A strong enemy group moved into a bamboo\r\ngrove on a nose in front of the center platoon of G Company. From\r\nthis position the enemy launched an attack which the company resisted\r\nwith grenades and bayonets. As Colonel Finn later reported: \"The\r\nbattle continued to flare up and die down as the valiant soldiers\r\nfought like devils to hold our lines.\" [840] The 81-mm. mortars from\r\nthe mortar platoon of H Company fired 650 rounds in five minutes,\r\nand fire from the 60-mm. mortars was \"practically automatic.\" [841]\r\nAfter an hour's intense fighting, the enemy force withdrew.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese had not attacked the left flank of G Company. These\r\ntroops heard the battle raging to the right and the sounds of the\r\nJapanese forming below them. A noncommissioned officer in charge\r\nof a listening post sent a man to get permission for his three-man\r\ngroup to withdraw. After receiving permission he shouted the order\r\nfrom a distance of fifty yards. As the men from the listening post\r\nstarted back, they were joined by the left platoon and two squads\r\nfrom the center platoon. Within forty-five minutes the two platoons,\r\nless one squad, plus the section of heavy machine guns, were moving\r\nsouth on the highway. \"There was no thought in their minds that the\r\nwithdrawal was not authorized.\" [842] After proceeding down the road\r\n250 yards they met the executive officer of Company H who ordered them\r\nback. It was too late, the damage was done. Though the left platoon\r\nwas able to regain its position without trouble, the two squads from\r\nthe center platoon found the enemy well dug-in in the bamboo thicket\r\nwhere the squads had been. It was later learned that there were about\r\ntwo hundred hostile troops with twenty machine guns in the thicket.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese were within the American lines and in a position from\r\nwhich they could fire on A Battery and the flanks of Companies E, L,\r\nI, and K. [843] Colonel Finn immediately took steps to contain the\r\npenetrators. The reserve platoon from I Company moved behind E Company\r\nto face north in order to stop any enemy troops moving south along\r\nthe high ground. The squad of the center platoon of Company G that\r\nhad remained in position was faced to the west in order to forestall\r\nany attempt to roll up the line of G Company. That part of G Company\r\nwhich had withdrawn was moved along the high ground behind E Company\r\nwhere it established contact with the rest of G Company that faced\r\nthe bamboo thicket. The right of F Company was turned south along the\r\nhighway. Although the enemy could not be denied access to the flat,\r\nopen ground leading to Damulaan, the rear of E and G Companies was\r\nprotected and the flat ground could be covered by fire. The Japanese\r\napparently did not realize the predicament of the Americans, since\r\nthey made no attempt to exploit it.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that G Company was fighting, the other companies, E,\r\nL, and I, were also hit, though the assault was not so heavy as the\r\none against G Company. The commanding officer of E Company, next to\r\nG Company, felt that the situation left him \"in a hell of a spot,\"\r\n[844] but he held his position. The Japanese steadily persisted in\r\ntheir pressure against the lines of the companies and the fighting\r\ncontinued throughout the night. The defenders yielded no ground\r\nand effectively used many supporting fires to disrupt the attack\r\nof the 26th Division. The Americans counted 400 Japanese dead the\r\nnext morning, but casualties of the 32d Infantry, despite the heavy\r\nfighting, had been surprisingly light. For the twenty-four hour period\r\nending at 1430 on 27 November, four officers and fifteen enlisted\r\nmen had been wounded and one enlisted man killed. [845]\r\n\r\nColonel Finn made plans for the recapture of the ground lost by G\r\nCompany, and General Arnold made available to him part of the 1st\r\nBattalion, 184th Infantry, which was at Caridad. The 1st Battalion,\r\nless B Company and two platoons from C Company, left Caridad at 0415\r\non 27 November, and by 0515 it was in Damulaan in readiness for the\r\nassault. Company G, 2d Battalion, 32d Infantry, was also available.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the enemy was in the midst of preparing\r\nnew plans. The Japanese felt that if they could recapture the\r\nBurauen airfields, all the American forces on Leyte would be in\r\njeopardy. General Suzuki therefore ordered his troops to prepare for\r\nan operation at Burauen. In order to concentrate the 26th Division\r\nfor his daring move across the mountains to strike at the Americans\r\nin the vicinity of the Burauen airfields, General Suzuki risked\r\nhis right flank, leaving only a detachment consisting of the 12th\r\nIndependent Infantry Regiment, one and one-half battalions of the 13th\r\nIndependent Infantry Regiment, and one battery of the 26th Artillery\r\nBattalion with two mobile guns to prevent the Americans from reaching\r\nAlbuera and cutting off the base of his attack. At the same time,\r\nstaff members of the 26th Division moved south to direct operations\r\nagainst the 7th Division. [846]\r\n\r\nThese Japanese measures were taken just as General Krueger was able\r\nto reinforce the attack toward Ormoc. The commanding officer of the\r\n1st Battalion, 184th Infantry, at dawn on 27 November got his troops\r\nready for the drive toward Albuera. He moved his battalion behind L\r\nand E Companies, 32d Infantry. Because of the limited area involved,\r\nthe battalion commander decided that only A Company would make the\r\nattack. The artillery, mortars, and machine guns placed heavy fire on\r\nthe bamboo thicket. At 0855 the troops moved out but were stopped by\r\nheavy machine gun fire after they had advanced about 200 yards. They\r\nthen withdrew about fifty yards while the artillery and mortars again\r\ncovered the area. [847] A second attack was also halted, and A Company\r\nagain pulled back. At 1430 a very heavy artillery concentration was\r\nplaced on the thicket. [848] Immediately thereafter C Company moved\r\nin swiftly and cleared out and secured the area by 1600. A total of\r\n109 enemy dead was counted and twenty-nine machine guns were removed.\r\n\r\nThe defensive perimeters of the 32d Infantry were set up. With the\r\naddition of the 1st Battalion, 184th Infantry, the lines were much\r\nstronger. During the night of 27 November elements of the 13th\r\nIndependent Infantry Regiment made minor attempts to infiltrate\r\nthrough the lines but were easily repulsed.\r\n\r\nBy now the Sixth Army had received substantial reinforcements. General\r\nHodge therefore ordered the 7th Division to assemble all forces in the\r\nBaybay area as rapidly as the logistical situation would permit. [849]\r\nBy 27 November sufficient troops had assembled to enable him to order\r\nGeneral Arnold to make \"an early and vigorous attack\" to destroy the\r\nJapanese in the area and then capture Ormoc. [850] On 28 November all\r\nthe assault elements of the 7th Division, with the exception of the\r\n1st Battalion, 32d Infantry, which was patrolling in the vicinity of\r\nPanaon Strait, were either on the eastern shore of the Camotes Sea\r\nor on the way there. The 1st Battalion, 184th Infantry, and the 2d\r\nand 3d Battalions, 32d Infantry, were still engaging the enemy at\r\na bamboo thicket on Shoestring Ridge south of the Palanas River and\r\neast of Damulaan. [851]\r\n\r\nThe troops of Colonel Finn's 32d Infantry were weary. They had\r\nprevented the Japanese 26th Division from going south along the eastern\r\nshore of the Camotes Sea and had held back the best the enemy had\r\nto offer. General Arnold desired that the 7th Division push through\r\nthe enemy lines with two regiments abreast toward Ormoc. The tired\r\n32d Infantry was to be drawn back and replaced by the 184th and 17th\r\nInfantry Regiments.\r\n\r\nOn 28 November, after receiving orders from General Arnold, the\r\ncommanding officer of the 184th Infantry, Col. Curtis D. O'Sullivan,\r\noutlined to his battalion commanders the new roles they were to\r\nplay. The 184th Infantry was to relieve the 32d Infantry and then\r\nattack to the front and cover the division's left sector. The 1st\r\nBattalion of the regiment was to relieve Company F, 32d Infantry,\r\nfrom the beach inland to a clump of trees held by the enemy 600 yards\r\ninland. Parts of Companies A and C were already at the edge of the\r\ngrove. The 2d Battalion, 184th Infantry, with the 57th Field Artillery\r\nBattalion in direct support, was to relieve Companies G and E of the\r\n32d Infantry, tie in with Company L of the 32d Infantry, and attack in\r\nthe direction of Hill 918. The 3d Battalion, in regimental reserve,\r\nwas to take a position in San Agustin. The 32d Infantry was to fall\r\nback to Tinagan. [852] At 1700 the 2d Battalion, 184th Infantry,\r\nrelieved the 2d Battalion, 32d Infantry, at Damulaan. [853]\r\n\r\nAt 1945 on 28 November elements of the 26th Division attacked from the\r\nsoutheast and northeast the right flank of Company A, 184th Infantry,\r\nat the bamboo thicket and pushed it back fifty yards. Battery B,\r\n57th Field Artillery Battalion, fired at the southern point of the\r\nenemy infiltration and also 100 yards to the west. [854] The Japanese\r\nattack was stopped, and the 1st Battalion held fast and dug in. [855]\r\n\r\nCompany E, 2d Battalion, hurriedly moved into a position from which,\r\nif requested, it could support the 1st Battalion. The 81-mm. mortar\r\nsection of the 2d Battalion was prepared to place fire in front of the\r\nzone of Company A, and two platoons from Company C were in position to\r\nfill a gap existing between the 1st and 2d Battalions. [856] By 2045\r\nthe 3d Battalion, 32d Infantry, and the 2d and 1st Battalions, 184th\r\nInfantry, were on a line from right to left. [857] The night was quiet\r\nexcept for sounds of enemy activity in front of the 2d Battalion. [858]\r\n\r\nAt 0900 on 29 November Company A of the 1st Battalion and Company F of\r\nthe 2d Battalion, after a mortar barrage, attacked to retake the lost\r\nground and to overrun the Japanese position in the bamboo thicket. They\r\nregained the ground without opposition, but as the troops approached\r\nthe thicket they met strong resistance. For the rest of the day the\r\nbattle seesawed back and forth as elements of the 184th Infantry and\r\nthe 26th Division contested for control of \"Bloody Bamboo Thicket,\"\r\nas it came to be called. Between 1820 and 1920, Company A repulsed\r\nthree heavy enemy attacks and killed an estimated fifty to eighty\r\nJapanese. [859] At 1800 Companies A and F made a co-ordinated but\r\nunsuccessful attack against the Japanese. They dug in for the night in\r\npositions from which they successfully withstood enemy attacks. [860]\r\n\r\nThe following morning both battalions sent patrols to scout out\r\nthe strength and installations of the enemy. At 1045 Company A,\r\nwhich had been in action for several days, was relieved by Company\r\nC and moved to the old position of the latter. [861] At 1400, after\r\na ten-minute artillery preparation, Company C and two platoons from\r\nCompany F on its right were to move out toward a ridge 150 yards\r\nnorth in order to strengthen the lines and secure positions on the\r\ncommanding terrain--part of which was the bamboo thicket over which\r\nCompany A and the enemy had fought.\r\n\r\nThe companies moved out on time and met little resistance until they\r\nhad penetrated twenty to thirty yards into the thicket, when the\r\nenemy strongly opposed any further advance. The troops of the 184th\r\nInfantry, however, steadily pushed on, and by 1603 Company C, with\r\nthe platoons from Company F just behind it, had cleared the bamboo\r\nthicket. Since the line of Company C extended over a wide front,\r\nit was tightened and shortened and tied into Company B. By 1730 the\r\ntroops of Companies C and F had consolidated their positions and\r\nformed a night perimeter on the forward slope of the ridge. [862]\r\nShoestring Ridge was firmly in American hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBattles of the Hills\r\n\r\nThe attempts of the 26th Division to drive the Americans back had been\r\nchecked, but the front lines remained practically the same as they\r\nhad been at the outset of the battle for Shoestring Ridge. It had\r\nbecome apparent that the most one regiment could do was to conduct\r\na holding action and that if the 7th Division was to continue the\r\nadvance it would be necessary to commit a stronger force against the\r\nJapanese. Elements of the 26th Division were by now firmly ensconced\r\nin the hills that overlooked Highway 2 and were in a position to\r\ncontest bitterly any forward movement of the 7th Division.\r\n\r\nA series of sharply edged ridges with many spurs, heavily overgrown\r\nwith bamboo thickets and high cogon grass, rose from the coastal plain\r\nto the central mountain range. (Map 17) One of these, Hill 918, was\r\nespecially important tactically, since from it one could observe the\r\nentire coast to the south, and as far as Ormoc to the north. About four\r\nfifths of a mile northeast of Hill 918 was the barrio of Kang Dagit,\r\nand about one and a half miles north of the hill was Kang Cainto. [863]\r\nOther important high points were Hill 380, between the Palanas and\r\nTabgas Rivers and about one and a third miles east of Balogo on Highway\r\n2, and Hill 606, between the Tabgas River and Calingatngan Creek and\r\napproximately one and a third miles east of Calingatngan on Highway 2.\r\n\r\nGeneral Arnold wished to attack north with two regiments abreast. He\r\ntherefore ordered Colonel O'Sullivan to send out a strong patrol to\r\nthe front of the 184th Infantry but not to attempt any advance until\r\nthe 17th Infantry could arrive from the east coast. On 3 December,\r\nwhen most of the 17th Infantry had reached the west coast, General\r\nArnold called a meeting of his regimental commanders. He told them that\r\nthe 7th Division was to renew the attack north at 0800 on 5 December\r\nwith regiments abreast, the 17th Infantry on the right and the 184th\r\nInfantry on the left, and secure the Talisayan River about three and\r\na half miles north, together with the intervening enemy positions on\r\nHills 918, 380, and 606. The boundary between the regiments was to be\r\nroughly 2,000 yards from the beach. [864] At this time the front-line\r\nunits of the 26th Division, which had been occupying a hill about\r\ntwo miles northwest of Damulaan, withdrew to the Palanas River and\r\na hill northeast of the river. A battalion of the 26th Division was\r\non the western slope of a hill north of the river. [865]\r\n\r\nOn 4 December the 184th Infantry prepared for the attack and sent\r\npatrols from the 1st and 2d Battalions to the front. These patrols\r\npenetrated as far north as Balogo. The 17th Infantry spent the day\r\nin moving forward the various elements of the regiment. [866] By\r\nnightfall the units of the 7th Division were in readiness for the\r\noffensive which was to start the following morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHill 918\r\n\r\nOn 4 December General Arnold ordered Lt. Col. O'Neill K. Kane to\r\nmove the tanks of the 776th Amphibian Tank Battalion by water under\r\ncover of darkness to a position 1,000 yards at sea to the west of\r\nBalogo, the next coastal town, about a mile to the north of the front\r\nlines. The tanks at dawn on the 5th were to assault the beaches in\r\nthat vicinity and fire on the town and on the north slopes of hills\r\nand ravines in the area. These movements of the tank battalion were\r\nto be closely co-ordinated with the 184th and 17th Infantry Regiments,\r\ninto whose areas the attack was to be made.\r\n\r\nAt 0635 on the 5th, the tank battalion in a column formation started\r\nto move north over water. The tanks advanced toward Balogo until\r\nthey were at a point offshore about 200 yards from the town. They\r\nthen continued north in a column formation and fired into the town\r\nof Tabgas. At the mouth of the Tabgas River, just short of Tabgas,\r\nthe tanks attacked in line formation. Moving ashore at 0700, they sent\r\napproximately 2,550 rounds of 75-mm. ammunition in direct fire against\r\nthe northern slopes of the hills that confronted the 7th Division.\r\n\r\nThe tanks completed their mission, took to the water again, and headed\r\nnorth for a mile to reconnoiter the area around Calingatngan. They\r\nthen turned south and started for the bivouac area. On the return,\r\nColonel Kane, elated over the success of their previous landing and\r\nwishing to use up the remaining ammunition, ordered the tanks to land\r\n500 yards south of the Tabgas River. From here the tanks fired and\r\nthen withdrew unhindered by enemy fire. At 1045 they were back in\r\ntheir bivouac area. [867]\r\n\r\nAt 0800 on 5 December the 184th and 17th Infantry Regiments moved out\r\nwith the 184th Infantry on the left. The 1st Battalion, 184th Infantry,\r\non the extreme left, reached the Palanas River without incident and\r\nwithout having to fire a single shot. [868] The Japanese historians,\r\nhowever, claimed that one of the amphibian tanks was set on fire and\r\nthat the 2d Battalion, 12th Independent Infantry Regiment, repulsed\r\nthe advance of the 184th Infantry. [869]\r\n\r\nThere were numerous finger ridges inland which were cut by deep\r\nravines and gorges that came to within a few hundred yards of the\r\ncoast line. The entrenched Japanese, using reverse slope tactics,\r\nwere able to deliver deadly fire on the advancing infantry. In many\r\ncases the reverse slopes were so steep that effective artillery\r\nfire could not be placed upon them. [870] The 2d Battalion, 184th\r\nInfantry, moved forward slowly toward a small hill which faced the\r\nPalanas River, and at 0858 it encountered enemy small arms fire from\r\nthe western slope of the hill. Using grenades, the battalion pushed\r\nforward, but at 0938 the Japanese opened up with three light machine\r\nguns. The supporting weapons of the 2d Battalion fired on the enemy\r\npositions to the front. At 1037, as the battalion reached the military\r\ncrest of the hill, the Japanese launched a small counterattack on the\r\nleft flank of Company E. This attack was repulsed, but the companies\r\ncontinued to receive small arms and machine gun fire.\r\n\r\nAt 1325 the 1st Battalion renewed its advance and proceeded without\r\nincident, finding the situation \"very quiet\" to its front. At 1435\r\nthe battalion dug in for the night approximately 300 yards south of\r\nBalogo. [871] The 3d Battalion moved through the gap between the 1st\r\nand 2d Battalions and across the front of the 2d Battalion on the\r\nright toward Hill 380, which consisted of a series of ridges. As the\r\n3d Battalion advanced toward the hill, it came under machine gun fire\r\non each flank. With artillery support, the troops reached the top of\r\nthe second ridge of Hill 380 and dug in, nine of the men having been\r\nwounded. [872] At 1635 the battalions of the 184th Infantry received\r\norders to set up night defense positions in depth and to hold the\r\n\"positions at all costs.\" [873] Colonel O'Sullivan decided that the 3d\r\nBattalion was to bear the brunt of the advance of the 184th Infantry\r\non 6 December and push on to Hill 380. [874]\r\n\r\nOn the right of the 184th the 17th Infantry had had a busy day in\r\nworking toward its objective, Hill 918. At 0800 on 5 December the\r\n1st and 2d Battalions of the 17th Infantry, with the 1st Battalion\r\non the left, had moved through the 32d Infantry. At 0906 the advance\r\nelements of the 1st Battalion secured a ridge south of the main ridge\r\nleading from Hill 918, and at 1000 the entire battalion closed on\r\nthis ridge. In the face of sporadic rifle and machine gun fire, the\r\nleading platoons pushed forward to secure a ridge that led west from\r\nHill 918. As the advance platoons neared the crest of this ridge,\r\nthey received intense rifle, machine gun, and mortar fire to the\r\nfront and on both flanks from the 2d Battalion, 12th Independent\r\nInfantry Regiment. At the same time the rest of the battalion, in\r\nattempting to reach a forward ridge and support the leading platoons,\r\nalso encountered cross fire that came down the intervening draw. As\r\nenemy gunfire pinned down the troops, the 1st Battalion lost contact\r\nwith Company G, 2d Battalion, and a gap developed between the 1st\r\nand 2d Battalions.\r\n\r\nThe 12th Independent Infantry Regiment, quickly alert to exploit\r\nthis opportunity to drive a wedge between the two forces, threw\r\napproximately a company armed with machine guns and mortars into the\r\ngap. Although they did not penetrate completely, the enemy troops were\r\nable to secure a position which would make any forward movement of\r\nthe 1st Battalion very costly. The 1st Platoon of Company B and the\r\n3d Platoon of Company A were still out on the forward ridge and cut\r\noff from the rest of the battalion. The reserve platoon of Company A\r\ntried an envelopment around the right flank of the 1st Battalion but\r\nwas stopped by the enemy in the gap. Company C moved up to protect\r\nthe rear of Company A. Eventually the forward platoons withdrew to the\r\nbattalion lines and preparations were made for the night. Under cover\r\nof darkness the 1st Battalion reorganized and moved into positions\r\non top of the first ridge. [875]\r\n\r\nEarlier that day the 2d Battalion had driven forward with Company E\r\non the right and Company G on the left. Company E went east along the\r\nBucan River for approximately 1,000 yards and then turned northeast\r\nto ascend Hill 918. At first, however, the company had to secure a\r\nsmall ridge southwest of Hill 918 on which was a small but dense banana\r\ngrove. Company E encountered and destroyed a small enemy force on this\r\nridge, after which the company reorganized and at approximately 1300\r\nbegan to ascend Hill 918 itself. When Company E reached the military\r\ncrest of the hill, the Japanese began heavy firing with grenade\r\nlaunchers and at least three machine guns. The enemy fire swept the\r\ncrest of the hill and prevented any movement over the lip of the ridge.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Company G went to the left of Company E and secured a\r\nsmall ridge about 1,200 yards from the line of departure and west of\r\nHill 918. The advance platoon of Company G then received fire from\r\nautomatic weapons that were emplaced in a draw to the left front\r\nof the platoon. The rest of the company attempted to move around\r\nto the right of the ridge but also encountered automatic weapons\r\nfire coming from another draw. Since high cogon grass covered the\r\narea, observation was limited to a matter of inches. At about 1300,\r\nelements of the 13th Independent Infantry Regiment counterattacked\r\nthrough a gap between Company G and Company A of the 1st Battalion. A\r\nmachine gun platoon, which was thrown in to plug the gap, succeeded\r\nin stopping the attempted Japanese advance.\r\n\r\nCompany G, however, continued to be pinned down by the enemy fire\r\ndirected at its front. Company F, the reserve company, was then\r\ncommitted to take a position between G and E Companies. Its mission\r\nwas to come abreast of Company E, take Hill 918, and then turn west\r\nand wipe out the resistance in front of Company G. At 1415 Company\r\nF moved up Hill 918 and reached Company E without opposition.\r\n\r\nThree spurs led down from Hill 918. The one occupied by Company E ran\r\nsouthwest, that occupied by Company F ran west, and the third ran\r\nnorthwest. As the two commanders started to launch a co-ordinated\r\nassault from their respective spurs, their companies received a\r\nconcentration of about fifty rounds of mortar fire but pushed through\r\nthis fire and secured the crests of both spurs. They immediately came\r\nunder automatic weapons and rifle fire from the northwest ridge.\r\n\r\nSince the left flank of Company F was in the tall cogon grass, it was\r\npractically impossible for the company to observe the enemy. On the\r\nother hand, Company E was on bare and open ground which exposed it to\r\nmachine gun and mortar fire from Hill 918. Both companies also came\r\nunder long-range machine gun fire from the vicinity of Kang Dagit,\r\nnortheast of Hill 918. It was impractical to attempt an envelopment to\r\nthe right, since the flank of Company E rested on a deep ravine which\r\nran to the bed of the Bagan River. An envelopment to the left would\r\nhave necessitated going down the hill, circling behind Company G,\r\nand attacking east from the positions of the 1st Battalion. Because\r\nof these unfavorable conditions, Companies E and F with their wounded\r\nwithdrew to make a line with Company G. [876]\r\n\r\nIn support of the advance of the 17th Infantry, the 49th Field\r\nArtillery Battalion fired 577 rounds of ammunition during the day. The\r\nfires \"varied from knocking out machine guns to fire on mortars and\r\non troops in the open.\" [877] The 17th Infantry had forced the 1st\r\nBattalion, 12th Independent Infantry Regiment, to start withdrawal\r\nto a hill farther north. At the same time, Japanese engineer and\r\nartillery units at Albuera \"were erecting anti-landing obstacles\r\nalong the beach and putting up antitank defenses.\" [878]\r\n\r\nAt the end of 5 December the 17th Infantry had secured the ridge west\r\nof Hill 918 and the 184th Infantry had secured a line extending from\r\nthe beach 300 yards south of Balogo east to the high ground southeast\r\nof the Palanas River. Company K, 32d Infantry, had filled a gap that\r\nhad existed between the 17th and 184th Infantry Regiments, while\r\nthe 3d Battalion, 184th Infantry, had crossed the Palanas River and,\r\nadvancing up the southwest slope of Hill 380, reached the top of the\r\nfirst ridge. There were no enemy attacks during the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHill 380\r\n\r\nGeneral Arnold ordered the regiments to capture all of Hill 918, the\r\nnorthern slope of Hill 380, and the Palanas River valley. The 1st\r\nand 2d Battalions, 17th Infantry, aided by the 2d Battalion, 184th\r\nInfantry, were to move northeast until their front lines were on an\r\neast-west line south of the Palanas River. They were then to launch an\r\nattack to the north and capture the slope of Hill 380 in their zone of\r\naction. The 3d Battalion, 17th Infantry, was to attack to the north on\r\nthe eastern slope of Hill 918 and capture the slope of Hill 380 in its\r\nzone of action. The 184th Infantry was to capture the northern slope\r\nof Hill 380 and assist the 17th Infantry in its movement north. [879]\r\n\r\nThe 184th Infantry started out at 0800 on 6 December with the 1st\r\nBattalion on the left and the 3d Battalion on the right. Supported\r\nby eight tanks, the 1st Battalion pushed through rifle fire, moved\r\ninto Balogo, and cleared the town. The battalion commander then\r\nordered Company B to seize a ridge just east of Balogo. Though the\r\ncompany temporarily secured the ridge, at 1155 the Japanese drove\r\nthe men off. At 1210 artillery and mortar fire was placed against\r\nthe Japanese positions on the ridge. As soon as the supporting fire\r\nlifted, at 1305, Company B sent a platoon through Company K to hit\r\nthe ridge from the right flank. [880] Company B secured the ridge\r\nat 1510 but fifty yards farther north on the southern slope of the\r\nnext ridge strong elements of the 26th Division had dug in, making\r\nit impossible for the troops to move forward. Before the jump-off of\r\nthe 3d Battalion, 184th Infantry, a platoon from Company K secured\r\nthe first ridge north of the battalion position. At 1000 the rest of\r\nthe battalion reached the top of Hill 380 and secured an enemy field\r\nartillery observation post from which it could see enemy activity\r\nin a deep valley north of Hill 380. Elements of the 26th Division\r\nset up machine guns and delivered mortar and artillery fire on\r\nHill 380 throughout the afternoon. [881] The 1st and 3d Battalions,\r\n184th Infantry, covered by mortar and artillery fire, set up night\r\nperimeters, the latter on Hill 380 and the former on the ridge east\r\nof Balogo. The 2d Battalion, 184th Infantry, remained in the Palanas\r\nRiver valley throughout the day.\r\n\r\nThe 1st and 2d Battalions of the 17th Infantry jumped off abreast. The\r\n1st Battalion reached the ridge which led west from Hill 918 and\r\noverlooked the Palanas River, where it found strong enemy positions\r\nthat had been abandoned. While the 1st Battalion reorganized, advance\r\nplatoons, one each from Companies B and C, went across the Palanas\r\nRiver to the next ridge, which overlooked the Tabgas River. The 1st\r\nBattalion, in conjunction with the 2d Battalion, 184th Infantry,\r\nfollowed the platoons at a distance of about 500 yards. Company\r\nB moved behind a \"protective nose\" which led south from the main\r\nridge and Company C pushed \"a knife edge east of Company B.\" [882] As\r\nCompany C reached a point just short of the main ridge, the men moved\r\nin single file and were pinned down by heavy machine gun cross fire\r\nfrom both flanks and to their front. Company B, attempting to envelop\r\nthe entrenched enemy from the west, encountered heavy fire on its left\r\nfront, which made any envelopment in that direction impossible. At 1500\r\na strong column of the enemy counterattacked the left flank of Company\r\nC, but six machine guns from Company D broke up the enemy attack. The\r\n1st Battalion dug in for the night halfway up Hill 380. [883]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, at 0800, the 2d Battalion, 17th Infantry, had started\r\nfor Hill 918. The 49th Field Artillery Battalion established a smoke\r\nscreen on the hill to cover the advance of the infantry, [884] and\r\nat 1100 Company E reached the crest of the hill. A patrol located\r\na trail that led down to the Palanas River. As Company E moved down\r\nthis trail, Company G, though under machine gun fire, pushed straight\r\nahead through the saddle to its front. [885] By 1715 all elements of\r\nthe 2d Battalion had reached the Palanas River and were moving left\r\nto establish contact with the 1st Battalion. From dug-in positions\r\nin the dense bamboo thickets on the northern bank of the river, the\r\nJapanese opened fire upon the 2d Battalion. Nothing serious developed,\r\nhowever, and the troops formed their night perimeters. The elements\r\nof the 1st and 2d Battalions, 17th Infantry, were now in contact on\r\na line along the Palanas River. [886]\r\n\r\nThe 3d Battalion, 17th Infantry, swung to the extreme right towards\r\nKang Dagit and Kang Cainto in order to hit Hill 380 from the east,\r\nbut it was hampered by ravines two to three hundred feet deep. Though\r\nthe advance was very slow, the 3d Battalion in a column of companies\r\nwith Company L in the lead was able to reach Kang Dagit where it\r\nclosed for the night. [887]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day the 7th Division had secured the barrio\r\nof Balogo, had overrun Hill 918 and occupied Kang Dagit, and had\r\nestablished elements of the division on the banks of the Palanas\r\nRiver and on part of Hill 380.\r\n\r\nThe night of 6-7 December was quiet. General Arnold ordered the 7th\r\nDivision to attack north at 0800 on 7 December and secure Hills 380\r\nand 606. The 184th Infantry was to capture the high ground south of\r\nthe Tabgas River. [888] Colonel Pachler ordered the 17th Infantry,\r\nwith its 1st Battalion on the left and its 2d Battalion on the right,\r\nto attack north to secure the portion of Hills 380 and 606 in its\r\nsector. The 3d Battalion, 17th Infantry, was to secure Kang Cainto\r\nand to be prepared to attack Hill 380 from the east or to continue\r\nnorth. At 0630 patrols went out to make reconnaissance and determine\r\nthe enemy strength and dispositions to their front. [889]\r\n\r\nAt 0913 the 184th Infantry moved out. It met little opposition, and\r\nat 1643 the regiment reached the high ground overlooking the Tabgas\r\nRiver and dug in for the night. [890]\r\n\r\nAt dawn the 17th Infantry sent out patrols. The one from the 1st\r\nBattalion located an enemy heavy machine gun, two light machine guns,\r\nand a mortar, emplaced 150 yards from the battalion's lines. When the\r\npatrol returned, mortar fire was placed on the position and it was\r\nwiped out. The 1st Battalion moved out at approximately 0900. Though\r\nlong-range fire fell on the troops and small arms fire hit the left\r\nflank of Company C, the men continued to push forward. The battalion\r\nfound several ridges leading up Hill 380--a knifelike ridge in front\r\nof Company C and a double ridge in the form of a horseshoe, with its\r\nclosed end toward the hill, in front of Company B.\r\n\r\nCompany B moved across the double ridge while Company C forced its\r\npassage through machine gun and rifle fire across the closed part\r\nof the horseshoe. At 1600 the two companies re-established contact\r\non the northernmost ridge leading to Hill 380. At 1630 the Japanese\r\nwith machine guns launched a counterattack against the right flank\r\nof the 3d Battalion, 184th Infantry, and the left flank of the 1st\r\nBattalion, 17th Infantry. The 3d Battalion, 184th, was pinned down\r\nbut did not yield any ground. The troops on the front lines of the\r\n1st Battalion, 17th Infantry, at first were forced back slightly but\r\nin a few minutes regained the lost ground. They dug in for the night\r\non the crest of the ridge. [891]\r\n\r\nAfter its dawn patrols had reported on 7 December, the 2d Battalion,\r\n17th Infantry, jumped off to the attack. Company E secured the first\r\nof the three spurs leading from Hill 380, and continued forward to\r\nthe middle spur in the face of light fire that came from in front of\r\nthe company in the area the 17th Infantry wished to secure. Presently\r\nthe fire grew to considerable intensity and the company's section of\r\nlight machine guns and two platoons of heavy machine guns moved onto\r\nthe middle spur, where they neutralized the enemy position.\r\n\r\nWhile this action was going on, Companies G and F moved to the first\r\nspur. Company G received orders from the battalion commander to make\r\na wide envelopment of Hill 380 and then assault the hill from the\r\neast. At 0930 the company dropped below the military crest of the\r\nsouthern slope of Hill 380 unobserved and made its way very slowly\r\nover the steep terrain and through the thick cogon grass. At 1200 the\r\n49th Field Artillery Battalion laid a five-minute preparatory fire\r\nin front of the battalion. [892] The American troops then routed the\r\nsurprised Japanese defenders and killed the majority of them as the\r\nothers fled into the mountains northeast of the hill.\r\n\r\nApparently realizing that Hill 380 was the key to defense of the\r\nTabgas River valley and Hill 606, troops of the 26th Division poured\r\nlong-range machine gun fire from Hill 606 into Company G and at the\r\nsame time halted the company with small arms fire from the immediate\r\nleft along the ridge. At 1355, after a heavy mortar barrage, about\r\nfifty men from the 26th Division counterattacked the positions of\r\nCompany G, but the company held firm and mowed down the attackers\r\nwith fire from its rifles and automatic weapons. The position on the\r\nhill was maintained.\r\n\r\nAlthough Company G occupied the top of Hill 380, it was not in a\r\nposition to aid the advance of Company E. The Japanese troops were\r\ndug in on the reverse slopes and could only be rooted out by close-in\r\nfighting. The commanding officer of the 2d Battalion committed Company\r\nF down the main spur from the east, supported by Companies E and G and\r\nthe machine guns from Company H. As soon as Company F started down the\r\nridge, the enemy concentrated fire upon it both from the north and the\r\nwest. In a matter of minutes Company F was reduced to a point where\r\nthe number of its riflemen hardly equaled one platoon. The company\r\ncommander secured an additional platoon from Company G and renewed the\r\nassault behind a concentration of 100 rounds of 60-mm. mortar fire\r\nand 80 rounds of 81-mm. mortar fire. The attack succeeded, and the\r\nenemy force was overrun and annihilated. Company E thereupon moved\r\nto the main ridge and helped mop up the area. [893]\r\n\r\nAt 0700 the 3d Battalion, 17th Infantry, moved out, reaching the source\r\nof the Palanas River at 1400. An enemy force of about fifty men was\r\nobserved in a natural bowl to its immediate front. The battalion placed\r\nlong-range rifle and machine gun fire on the group as two platoons from\r\nCompany K attacked from the flank. They destroyed the entire Japanese\r\nforce without any casualties to the American troops. The 3d Battalion\r\nthen crossed the Palanas River and went into night perimeter at Kang\r\nCainto. At 1907 eight rounds of artillery fire fell into the area,\r\nkilling seven men and wounding eighteen others. [894]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day the 184th Infantry was on the banks of the\r\nTabgas River and the 17th Infantry had secured Hill 380, which\r\ncommanded the Tabgas River valley.\r\n\r\nAlthough several days of hard going still lay ahead before the 7th\r\nDivision was to reach its objective, the Talisayan River, the backbone\r\nof the Japanese resistance had been broken and the Battle of the Ridges\r\nwas virtually won. The division had achieved what the Japanese had\r\nconsidered impossible. It had pushed through Leyte over the tortuous\r\nmountain road between Abuyog and Baybay, it had held the enemy back\r\nat Shoestring Ridge, and it had then pushed north along the shores\r\nof Ormoc Bay toward Ormoc, decimating the right flank detachment of\r\nthe 26th Division in the process. General Suzuki had been forced to\r\nsend south much of his tactical strength, which was to have been used\r\nfor the defense of Ormoc. The 7th Division had assisted in no small\r\nway in tightening the ever-shortening noose about the Japanese who\r\nremained on the island.\r\n\r\nOn this day, 7 December, the 77th Division landed at Deposito just\r\nbelow Ormoc. The 26th Division was caught between two strong American\r\ndivisions. It was doomed. At this point the action of the 7th Division\r\nmerged with that of the 77th Division in the drive of the XXIV Corps\r\nagainst Ormoc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nThe Fall of Ormoc\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a time for decision. By the first of December the two\r\nadversaries had taken the measure of each other, but neither felt\r\nsatisfied with the progress of the campaign.\r\n\r\nThe tide of battle was slowly turning against the Japanese. They had\r\nwagered major stakes that the battle of Leyte should be the decisive\r\none of the Philippines. Someway, somehow, the Japanese felt, they must\r\nregain the initiative or Leyte, for which so much had been sacrificed,\r\nwould be lost to them. The days had dwindled to a precious few.\r\n\r\nImperial General Headquarters was loath to write off the Leyte\r\nCampaign. A daring plan was conceived whereby the ground and air\r\nforces, working in close co-ordination, would attempt to wrest the\r\ninitiative from General Krueger's forces. Before the main effort,\r\nsuicide aircraft carrying demolition teams were to crash-land on the\r\nDulag and Tacloban airstrips and render them unfit for use. Thereafter,\r\nthe 2d Raiding Group of the 4th Air Army would transport two paratroop\r\ncompanies to the Burauen airfields. The paratroops in conjunction\r\nwith elements of the 35th Army, including the 26th Division, would\r\nthen seize the Burauen airfields. The time was to be the evening of\r\n5 December. With the loss of the airfields, the U. S. Sixth Army,\r\nit was hoped, would be in a perilous situation. [895]\r\n\r\nGeneral Krueger was also making plans. By the middle of November strong\r\nelements of the Sixth Army were trying to force their way into the\r\nOrmoc Valley and others were on the eastern shore of Ormoc Bay. The\r\nplan of General Krueger was simple. He wanted to secure control of\r\nthe valley and the port of Ormoc and thus force the Japanese into\r\nthe mountains near the western coast, from which they could escape\r\nonly by sea.\r\n\r\nAt this time the XXIV Corps was with difficulty driving west and\r\nnorth from the center of the island. The 96th Division was engaged in\r\nmopping up in the mountains overlooking Leyte Valley. Units of the 7th\r\nDivision, far to the south, were moving westward toward Baybay on the\r\nshore of the Camotes Sea. The 1st Cavalry Division and the 24th and 32d\r\nInfantry Divisions of the X Corps were making slow progress in driving\r\ndown the Ormoc corridor from the Limon-Pinamopoan-Carigara area.\r\n\r\nSeveral courses of action were now open to General Krueger. He could\r\nconcentrate on the drive of the 32d Infantry Division and the 1st\r\nCavalry Division south down the Ormoc corridor, or on the advance of\r\nthe 7th Division north along the coast of Ormoc Bay from Baybay to\r\nOrmoc. A third course also presented itself. An amphibious overwater\r\nmovement might be attempted by landing troops just below Ormoc in the\r\nmidst of the enemy force, thus dividing the Japanese strength. After\r\nlanding, the troops could push north, seize Ormoc, and then drive\r\nup the Ormoc corridor and effect a juncture with elements of the X\r\nCorps. This move, though highly hazardous, would considerably shorten\r\nthe Leyte Campaign if successfully carried out.\r\n\r\nIn mid-November, therefore, General Krueger proposed that an amphibious\r\nmovement and a landing at a point just below Ormoc be made. At\r\nthat time, however, the naval forces did not have the necessary\r\nassault and resupply shipping on hand to mount and maintain such\r\nan operation and to execute as well the Mindoro operation scheduled\r\nfor 5 December. Since there was insufficient air support, the local\r\nnaval commander felt that a convoy entering Ormoc Bay might be in\r\njeopardy and that Japanese suicide bombing tactics could cause heavy\r\nlosses. Unable to secure the necessary assault shipping, General\r\nKrueger temporarily set aside his plan. [896]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlan for Amphibious Movement\r\n\r\nOn 30 November General MacArthur postponed for ten days the Mindoro\r\noperation. [897] The postponement would make available the amphibious\r\nshipping and naval support that were necessary for a landing in the\r\nOrmoc area. From a naval point of view, however, the operation was\r\nvery precarious, since the Japanese were still making aerial attacks\r\nthat could seriously damage the shipping needed for the forthcoming\r\nMindoro and Luzon operations. After careful consideration of the\r\nrisks involved, Admiral Kinkaid decided to make available to General\r\nKrueger the shipping required for an amphibious movement to a point\r\nbelow Ormoc. [898]\r\n\r\nAfter issuing a warning order on 1 December, General Krueger on 4\r\nDecember ordered the two corps to make their \"main effort,\" starting 5\r\nDecember, toward the defeat of the enemy forces in the Ormoc area. The\r\nX Corps was to advance \"vigorously south astride Highway 2 so as\r\nto support the effort made by the ... XXIV Corps.\" The commanding\r\ngeneral of the XXIV Corps was to arrange with the commander of the\r\nnaval task group for the shipping and naval gunfire support necessary\r\nto transport and land a division just below Ormoc. General Hodge,\r\nalso, was to arrange with the commanding general of the Fifth Air\r\nForce for close air support for the landing and subsequent operations\r\nashore. [899] The 77th Division was selected to make the amphibious\r\nmovement to the Ormoc area.\r\n\r\nIn planning for the Leyte operation the Sixth Army had designated\r\nMaj. Gen. Andrew D. Bruce's 77th Infantry Division, then on Guam, as\r\nthe second of its two reserve divisions. As a result of the successes\r\nin the first days of the campaign, however, General MacArthur thought\r\nit would not be necessary to use the division on Leyte. On 29 October,\r\nwithout General Krueger's concurrence, General MacArthur transferred\r\ncontrol of the division from General Krueger to Admiral Nimitz,\r\nCommander in Chief, Pacific Ocean Area. [900] Shortly afterward the\r\nJapanese began their reinforcements of Leyte and a captured Japanese\r\nfield order revealed that an all-out offensive would be launched\r\nagainst the Americans in the middle of November. These developments\r\nled General MacArthur to request Admiral Nimitz to divert the 77th\r\nDivision, which was on its way to New Caledonia, to the Tacoloban area\r\non Leyte. [901] Admiral Nimitz acquiesced and told General MacArthur\r\nthat the division was being sent to Manus. After its arrival there,\r\noperational control over it would pass to General MacArthur. [902]\r\n\r\nUpon arrival of the 77th Division at Seeadler Harbor on Manus at 1330,\r\n15 November, General MacArthur ordered it to go to Leyte and come\r\nunder the control of General Krueger. [903] After the ships' stores\r\nhad been replenished, the convoy sailed out of the anchorage at 1700,\r\n17 November, and made the voyage to Leyte without incident. [904]\r\nThe units commenced landing on the eastern shores of Leyte in the\r\nvicinity of Tarragona and Dulag about 1800, 23 November, and came\r\nunder the control of General Krueger who assigned the division to\r\nGeneral Hodge. From 23 to 25 November it was engaged in unloading\r\nthe transports and establishing bivouac areas.\r\n\r\nOn 19 November, while it was still at sea, General Krueger had ordered\r\nthe 77th Division to furnish immediately after landing a ship-unloading\r\ndetail of about 1,200 men for the projected operation at Mindoro. [905]\r\nAt 1600 on 27 November the detail, a battalion of the 306th Infantry,\r\nboarded LCI's at Tarragona Beach and departed for the staging area\r\nfor the Mindoro operation.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with General Krueger's plans, General Hodge ordered\r\nthe 77th Division to make preparations for the amphibious operation\r\nbelow Ormoc. (Map 19) It was to be assisted by the 7th Division,\r\nwhich was to attack and capture the high ground south of the Panilahan\r\nRiver. General Bruce, once ashore, was to direct and co-ordinate the\r\nattack of the 7th Division with that of the 77th Division. [906]\r\nGeneral Krueger informed General Hodge that he did not approve of\r\nthis arrangement and added that such co-ordination as was necessary\r\nshould be exercised by Hodge as corps commander. [907]\r\n\r\nAt a point about three and a half miles southeast of Ormoc was\r\nthe barrio of Deposito where the 77th Division was to land. Along\r\nthe eastern shore of Ormoc Bay, south from Ormoc, there were many\r\nareas which offered suitable landing beaches. These were crossed by\r\nnumerous rivers and streams which discharged into Ormoc Bay. None of\r\nthese would be a handicap, since all could be forded except during the\r\nmonsoon season. The beach area selected, though narrow, was suitable\r\nfor landing, having a surface of hard sand and gravel that could be\r\nused as a road by vehicles.\r\n\r\nThe terrain was level for about a mile and a half inland from\r\nthe beach, and then rose gradually to a height of twenty to thirty\r\nfeet. Half a mile farther inland, the mountain slopes began. Highway 2,\r\nwhich was ten feet wide and composed of sand and gravel, ran along the\r\nentire length of the east coast of Ormoc Bay. Several roads ran from\r\nHighway 2 to the beach: one was about a hundred yards south of the\r\nBaod River and skirted the rice paddies in the middle of the landing\r\nbeach area; another, just south of the rice paddies, extended inland\r\nabout two miles from the beach. [908]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNaval Plans\r\n\r\nWhen the naval forces were informed that the overwater movement to\r\nOrmoc would take place and that the Mindoro operation was postponed,\r\nthe shipping reserved for the Mindoro operation was turned over to\r\nthe Ormoc force. Rear Adm. Arthur D. Struble was given command of\r\nTask Group 78.3, which was to transport and land the 77th Division,\r\ntogether with its supplies and equipment, in the Ormoc Bay area and\r\nsupport the landing by naval gunfire. [909]\r\n\r\nAdmiral Struble divided his task group into six units, in addition\r\nto the destroyer which was his flagship. These consisted of: a\r\nFast Transport Unit of eight transports; a Light Transport Unit of\r\ntwenty-seven landing craft and twelve LSM's (medium landing ships);\r\na Heavy Transport Unit of four LST's (tank landing ships); an Escort\r\nUnit of twelve destroyers; a Mine-Sweeping Unit of nine mine sweepers\r\nand a transport; and a Control and Inshore Support Unit made up of\r\nfour LCI(R)'s (infantry rocket landing craft), two submarine chasers,\r\nand one tug. The landing was to be made between the Baod and Bagonbon\r\nRivers but clear of the Bagonbon River delta. The northern half of\r\nthe beach was called White I and the southern half White II. Six\r\ndestroyers would bombard the landing beaches.\r\n\r\nThe line of departure was fixed at 2,000 yards from the beach,\r\nbut if the shore fire became heavy the line of departure would be\r\nmoved back 1,000 yards. There would be five assault waves with two\r\nLCI(R)'s flanking the first wave to the beach. Each craft would fire\r\nso as to cover the sector of the beach in its area to a depth of 600\r\nyards. After completion of the bombardment the LCI(R)'s would reload\r\nand remain on the flanks to engage targets of opportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAir Support Plans [910]\r\n\r\nThe Fifth Air Force would provide both day and night air cover for\r\nthe journey of the assault convoy to the target, for the landings,\r\nand for the return convoy. It was estimated that on 5 December,\r\nfor the journey to the target, seventeen night fighter sorties and\r\nseventy-two day fighter sorties would be required. Protection would\r\nalso be furnished by the bombers, and forty-six aircraft would be\r\navailable on call for strikes against enemy installations and targets\r\nof opportunity, as well as for special missions.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the landings, the tempo would be accelerated. There\r\nwould be nineteen night fighter sorties and ninety-six day fighter\r\nsorties; ten flights of forty bombers to cover the beachhead; six\r\nnights of twenty-four bombers to cover the return of the assault\r\nconvoy; and eleven night fighters to cover the LST and main assault\r\nconvoys, the beachhead, and the return convoy. There would also be\r\navailable sixteen bombers for interception or additional cover for\r\nthe beachhead and convoy; twenty-four P-47's for interception, ground\r\nsupport, and attacks against enemy shipping or targets of opportunity;\r\nsixteen P-40's for ground strikes; and thirty-four F4U's for cover\r\nor interception.\r\n\r\nThe 77th Division continued to assemble its troops on Tarragona Beach,\r\non the east coast of Leyte, and during the night of 5 December the\r\nloading of supplies and equipment on the landing ships began. The\r\nloading was slowed by frequent air alerts. The division had previously\r\nbeen told that the convoy would be unable to stay in the landing area\r\nmore than two hours and consequently there was no attempt to bulk load\r\nsupplies, since they would take too long to unload. All supplies and\r\nequipment to support the initial assault had to be mobile-loaded, that\r\nis, loaded on the vehicles taken with the division so that the supplies\r\ncould be brought ashore in the vehicles upon debarkation. There\r\nwere only 289 vehicles in the initial convoy, including tanks, M8's,\r\nand M10's that could not carry supplies. The LVT's (tracked landing\r\nvehicles) were filled with supplies rather than troops in order that\r\nthey could be discharged from the landing ships into the water and\r\ngo ashore fully loaded. Furthermore, since the supplies were mobile\r\nthey could be moved either by water or inland by motor. [911] The 77th\r\nDivision gave the highest priority to ammunition, water, and rations.\r\n\r\nAbout 0700 on 6 December the assault shipping rendezvoused off\r\nTarragona and Rizal Beaches, and one hour later the assault troops\r\nbegan to board the vessels. The loading was completed at 1200 and\r\nthe convoy assembled offshore from Dulag to await the arrival of the\r\ntwelve escorting destroyers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Movement Overwater\r\n\r\nThe Convoy Sails\r\n\r\nTwo mine sweepers swept the Canigao Channel between Leyte and Bohol\r\non 27 November and again on 4 and 6 December, but they encountered no\r\nmines of any sort. [912] At 1200 on 6 December the convoy's escorting\r\ndestroyers departed from San Pedro Bay and moved to the point of\r\nrendezvous offshore, near the Tarragona-Rizal area. The principal\r\nconvoy was formed and got under way at 1330, having been preceded by\r\nfour slower-moving LST's escorted by two destroyers. The commander\r\nof the destroyer unit gave additional protection to the transports\r\nwith four destroyers until 2300, when the destroyers departed for a\r\nprelanding raid on Ormoc Bay. They were also to intercept any Japanese\r\nsurface vessels that might be attempting to bring reinforcements into\r\nOrmoc harbor.\r\n\r\nThe journey through Leyte Gulf, Surigao Strait, and the Camotes Sea\r\nwas uneventful. Several unidentified planes flew over the convoy but\r\ndid not launch an attack. The only alert during the voyage was about\r\ntwilight on the 6th of December, when an unidentified group of eighteen\r\nbombers flew over the formation in the direction of Tacloban. The\r\nconvoy encountered numerous small native craft en route and checked\r\nseveral of these but found no Japanese. [913]\r\n\r\nThroughout the night the vessels steamed toward the target. Silently\r\nthey took their stations in Ormoc Bay, off the coast of Deposito,\r\nbefore dawn. At 0634 on 7 December an enemy shore battery opened fire,\r\nwhich was answered at 0640 as the destroyers commenced firing upon\r\ntheir assigned targets. Behind Ipil, in the vicinity of the northern\r\nfire support group, a number of enemy 3-inch gun positions were\r\nobserved. The destroyers took the positions under fire and quickly\r\nsilenced them. At 0655 a large number of Japanese were observed in the\r\ntown of Albuera and these also were taken under fire. The destroyers\r\ncovered the landing beaches until ordered to lift fire just as the\r\nfirst wave of the landing party was approaching the beach. [914]\r\n\r\nAs the American convoy steamed into position, it received word that\r\nan enemy convoy was on the way to Ormoc with reinforcements. Aircraft\r\nof the V Fighter Command flew to intercept the Japanese vessels,\r\nwhich comprised six transports and seven escort vessels. During\r\nthe morning occurred one of the most intense aerial battles of the\r\nLeyte Campaign. Fifty-six P-47's of the 341st and 347th Fighter\r\nSquadrons dropped ninety-four 1,000-pound and six 500-pound bombs\r\non the enemy shipping and strafed the vessels. The Army and Marine\r\nland-based aircraft destroyed two cargo vessels and two passenger\r\ntransports. [915] Nearly all the available American aircraft were\r\nengaged in the attack. General MacArthur in his daily communique\r\nestimated that the entire convoy was wiped out and that 4,000 enemy\r\ntroops lost their lives. [916]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Land the Landing Party\"\r\n\r\nThe landing of the first wave, scheduled for 0630, was delayed until\r\n0707 to take advantage of better light for the naval bombardment. There\r\nwere to be five waves for each regiment. [917] At 0701 the first wave\r\nof small landing craft left the line of departure and raced for the\r\nshore. The first wave was landed at 0707, co-ordinating its spacing\r\nand timing with that of the LCI(R)'s supporting the landing. There\r\nwas no opposition, and the troops moved inland.\r\n\r\nThe dispatch and landing of the fourth wave of LCI(R)'s was delayed\r\nbecause the third wave had been unable to disembark the troops and\r\nretract according to schedule. The fifth wave of LSM's was delayed\r\nfor the same reason. Since the tide was rapidly falling and the sand\r\nbar was exposed, a tug was used in several instances to pull the craft\r\noff. At 1100 the commander of the task group pulled out, leaving behind\r\none LCI and four LSM's stranded on the beach. The tug left at the same\r\ntime, and Admiral Struble ordered the grounded craft to retract at high\r\ntide and proceed back to San Pedro Bay under cover of darkness. [918]\r\n\r\nWith the departure of the landing waves for the shore, the destroyers\r\nturned their fire upon targets adjacent to the landing beaches. The\r\nLaffey at 0830 opened fire against some enemy troops approaching\r\nthe barrio of Ipil from the north and turned them back. At 0930 the\r\nConyngham fired upon a possible concentration south of Ipil and at\r\n1000 this destroyer's shore fire control party requested additional\r\nsupport against enemy troops that were moving into Ipil. [919]\r\n\r\nAt 0820 the Japanese launched a strong aerial offensive against the\r\nAmerican vessels in Ormoc Bay. The enemy air attacks continued for\r\nnearly nine and a half hours. The Fifth Air Force, beginning at 0700,\r\ngave air cover throughout the day and \"did an excellent job.\" [920]\r\nUpon a number of occasions, however, the enemy airplanes slipped\r\nthrough the antiaircraft fire and the air protection and hit the\r\nshipping. Japanese suicide aircraft struck and badly damaged five\r\nvessels. At 0945 the destroyer Mahan and the high-speed transport\r\nWard received such damaging blows that they later had to be sunk\r\nby gunfire. [921] The Japanese made sixteen different raids on the\r\nshipping, during which an estimated forty-five to fifty enemy aircraft\r\nattacked the formation. Thirty-six of these were believed to have\r\nbeen shot down. [922]\r\n\r\nThe landing waves arrived ashore without incident and without\r\ncasualties. Within thirty-five minutes the advance echelon of division\r\nheadquarters, including the assistant division commander and the\r\ngeneral staff sections, were ashore. [923] Approximately 2,000 men\r\nwere placed on a 1,000-yard beach every five minutes. Mobile-loading\r\nof supplies had made this speed possible. \"Logistically it was a\r\ndifficult operation to push that mass of troops and equipment on a\r\nbeach in so short a time and had there been any considerable unexpected\r\nenemy mortar or artillery fire at any time during the period, great\r\ncasualties might have resulted.\" [924] At 0930 General Bruce assumed\r\ncommand ashore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJapanese Plans\r\n\r\nUntil the middle of November, the commander of the Japanese 35th Army\r\nhad failed to put any beach obstacles along the shores of Ormoc Bay,\r\n[925] since he believed that there was little likelihood of an American\r\nthrust up the bay. General Suzuki thought that the Americans would\r\nbe deterred by the presence of a Japanese naval base on Cebu in front\r\nof Bohol Strait. As American naval activity increased along the coast\r\nin the last part of November, however, the Japanese finally conceded\r\nthat there was \"a great possibility\" of an American landing at Ormoc\r\nBay. By the middle of the month the Ormoc Defense Headquarters was\r\norganized under the command of Colonel Mitsui, the commanding officer\r\nof the Shipping Unit. The main force of the Defense Headquarters was\r\nthe Shipping Unit, but the Antitank and Antiaircraft Gun Units, the\r\nAutomatic Gun Company, and other units were added. In addition, all\r\nunits then in Ormoc were temporarily placed under Colonel Mitsui. The\r\nenemy plan of defense was simple. At the town of Ormoc the Japanese,\r\nfrom their main defensive positions, were to stop the advance and then,\r\ngathering as much strength as possible, they were to counterattack.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese defenses, however, were not completed at the time of\r\nthe American landings. Only individual trenches had been dug along\r\nthe coast, and the field positions in the northern part of Ipil were\r\nelementary. Upon being alerted that the Americans had landed, the\r\nShipping Unit of Colonel Mitsui took up its main defensive positions\r\nin the Ipil area. At the same time, troops of the Nonaka Battalion of\r\nthe 30th Division, consisting of an infantry company and a machine\r\ngun company, were placed under the command of Colonel Mitsui. The\r\nmajor part of the 30th Division remained on Mindanao. The American\r\nstrength was estimated to be one regiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDrive Toward Ormoc\r\n\r\nIpil\r\n\r\nThe assault elements of the 77th Division advanced inland immediately\r\nafter landing. The 1st Battalion of Col. Vincent J. Tanzola's 305th\r\nInfantry, with two companies abreast, was to seize the crossings\r\nover the Bagonbon River in the vicinity of Highway 2. [926] The\r\n307th Infantry was to move rapidly inland and establish an initial\r\nbeachhead line about 1,300 yards east near a bridge over the Baod\r\nRiver. The 305th Infantry landed in a column of battalions with the\r\n1st, 3d, and 2d Battalions going ashore in that order. The 1st and\r\n3d Battalions moved rapidly inland to the objective while the 2d\r\nBattalion remained in regimental reserve. The 307th Infantry also\r\nreached the bridge without difficulty. In the town of Deposito, enemy\r\nfoxholes had been dug in the tall grass and apparently were to be\r\nused only as a protection against Allied air attacks, since they had\r\nno field of fire. Immediately upon landing, a reconnaissance patrol\r\nwent to locate a trail leading from the beach to Highway 2. About 300\r\nyards north of the Bagonbon River, the patrol found a small access\r\nroad which was put to immediate use. [927] The initial beachhead\r\nline was achieved within forty-five minutes after landing. Most of\r\nthe Japanese 26th Division which had been in the area were either\r\nmoving over the mountains to participate in a battle for the Burauen\r\nairfields or were engaging the 7th Division south of Deposito. Little\r\nbesides service troops remained to oppose the 77th Division.\r\n\r\nGeneral Bruce originally had planned to hold the beachhead line,\r\nestablish a defensive position, and await the arrival of additional\r\nsupplies and reinforcements on the following day. But because of\r\nthe lack of organized resistance, the speed with which the troops\r\nmoved inland, and his desire to fully exploit the situation before\r\nthe Japanese could counterattack, he very early decided to continue\r\nthe attack northward astride the highway and extend the division's\r\nbeachhead to Ipil. [928]\r\n\r\nThe 307th Infantry (less the 2d Battalion which was on Samar), under\r\nCol. Stephen S. Hamilton, together with the 2d Battalion of Col. Aubrey\r\nD. Smith's 306th Infantry, which was attached to the regiment after\r\nthe landing, was ordered by General Bruce to move northward and take\r\nIpil. [929] At about 1045, with the 1st Battalion in the lead, the\r\nregiment moved out northward astride Highway 2 toward Ipil. At the same\r\ntime the division artillery was in position to support the advance. The\r\n306th Field Artillery Battalion had been previously placed in the 7th\r\nDivision area at a position from which it could fire as far north as\r\nIpil and 6,000 yards inland. [930] At first there was little enemy\r\nopposition, but the troops observed many well-camouflaged foxholes\r\nunder the houses, and many stores of Japanese food and ammunition.\r\n\r\nWithin ten minutes after starting, the 1st Battalion, 307th Infantry,\r\nwas 300 yards north of Deposito and by 1215 had advanced 500 yards\r\nfarther north. Japanese resistance became heavier as the troops\r\nneared Ipil. The remaining troops of the Nonaka Battalion of the 30th\r\nDivision, consisting of an infantry company and a machine gun company,\r\nhad landed at Ormoc from junks and \"fought bravely\" under the command\r\nof the Shipping Unit. [931] The enemy had emplaced machine guns, and\r\nin one instance a cannon, in dugouts under the houses. [932] By 1455\r\nthe 307th Infantry was on the outskirts of Ipil, but its advance was\r\ntemporarily held up when the Japanese exploded one of their ammunition\r\ndumps. [933] By 1740 the 1st Battalion had cleared the barrio and set\r\nup a night perimeter on its northern outskirts. The regiment had killed\r\nan estimated sixty-six Japanese and had captured one prisoner of war,\r\na medical supply dump, a bivouac area, and numerous documents. [934]\r\n\r\nThe 305th Infantry during the day moved south to the Bagonbon River\r\nwithout serious opposition. Patrols of platoon strength were sent\r\nto scout out enemy positions and, if possible, establish contact\r\nwith the 7th Division which was fighting north along the coast from\r\nBaybay. These patrols went as far south as the Panalihan River,\r\ndestroying three food dumps and knocking out an enemy pillbox. [935]\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon enemy aircraft that were molesting the shipping\r\ndropped some bombs ashore but no appreciable damage resulted. The\r\ndivision artillery established a command post approximately 200 yards\r\ninland on the southern banks of the Baod River. As the beachhead line\r\nextended, the artillery moved to the northern banks of the river. This\r\nposition afforded better cover and concealment. The artillery fired\r\non enemy machine guns, mortars, and troops. [936]\r\n\r\nAt 1640 General Bruce issued orders for the regiments to consolidate\r\ntheir positions and form night perimeters. The 77th Division had\r\nestablished a two-mile beachhead extending from Ipil in the north\r\nto the Bagonbon River on the south and had penetrated inland nearly\r\na mile.\r\n\r\nGeneral Bruce's plan at this time was to push forward vigorously\r\nand capture Ormoc, after which he would drive north, take Valencia,\r\nand make contact with elements of the X Corps. Each day he would\r\n\"roll up his rear\" to form a defensive perimeter at night. Patrols\r\nwould be sent east to locate enemy concentrations and destroy them\r\nby artillery fire, and at the same time other patrols would move to\r\nthe east to search out routes and Japanese dispositions with a view\r\nto taking Valencia from the east. [937]\r\n\r\nIn planning for the amphibious landing, the Fifth Air Force had\r\nordered the 308th Bombardment Wing to conduct bombing and strafing\r\nmissions, in addition to providing cover for the movement. [938]\r\nThe plans for 8 December called for the 308th Bombardment Wing to be\r\nprepared on request to bomb Camp Downes--a prewar military post south\r\nof Ormoc--maintain a close vigilance over Ormoc, and continue the\r\noverhead air patrols. [939] The 307th Infantry was to move north at\r\n0800 astride Highway 2 and seize Camp Downes. The 305th Infantry was\r\nto withdraw from the south and move north in support of the attack\r\nof the 307th Infantry and at the same time protect the southern\r\nand southeastern flanks of the division. The 902d Field Artillery\r\nBattalion and Company A of the 776th Amphibian Tank Battalion would\r\nsupport the attack. At least two patrols of the 305th Infantry would\r\nbe sent south to disrupt enemy communications. All other units of\r\nthe division were to be prepared to move north on division order. [940]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCamp Downes\r\n\r\nImmediately north of Ipil, Colonel Mitsui had constructed a few small\r\nstrong points, each of which consisted of two coconut log pillboxes,\r\nseveral trenches, and foxhole emplacements for machine guns. Between\r\nthese positions and Camp Downes were groups of enemy riflemen and\r\nmachine gunners on the banks of the streams and at the ends of wooded\r\nridges that extended from the northeast toward the highway. They\r\nhad dug in at the bases of the trees and on the edges of the bamboo\r\nclumps. In the sector between Ipil and Camp Downes the highway was\r\nnine feet wide, with three-foot shoulders, and surfaced with coral or\r\ngravel. Fields of sugar cane or grassy hills lay east of the road,\r\nwhich was fringed with clumps of acacia or coconut trees. At least\r\none reinforced enemy company had taken up its last defensive stand\r\nat Camp Downes. Less than a mile from Ormoc, Camp Downes had been an\r\nimportant Philippine Army and Constabulary camp before the war. The\r\nplateau on which it was situated lay east of the highway and commanded\r\nall approaches, most of which were open and without cover. A ravine\r\nran along the southern side of the barrio. At Camp Downes the Japanese\r\nhad placed thirteen machine guns, two 40-mm. antiaircraft guns, and\r\nthree 75-mm. field pieces under the porches and in the foundations\r\nof buildings. These were well camouflaged and mutually supporting\r\nand were protected by concealed riflemen. [941]\r\n\r\nAs the 77th Division consolidated its positions in Ipil, the Japanese\r\nstarted to use reinforcements to check any further advance toward\r\nOrmoc. The 12th Independent Infantry Regiment had been assembling at\r\nDolores, northeast of Ormoc. On the night of 7 December its commander,\r\nColonel Imahori, ordered the newly arrived Kamijo Battalion, which\r\nconsisted of two companies, to co-operate with the Shipping Unit under\r\nColonel Mitsui in delaying the advance of the American forces until\r\nthe arrival of the main body of the 12th Independent Infantry. [942]\r\nBy the morning of 8 December it became evident to the 77th Division\r\nthat it had surprised the enemy.\r\n\r\nAt 0615 enemy planes flew over the command post area, and ten minutes\r\nlater one of these was shot down by antiaircraft fire. [943] At 0800\r\nColonel Hamilton's 307th Infantry moved out. [944] By 1000 the regiment\r\nwas 200 yards north of Ipil, but it encountered more determined\r\nresistance when it reached the Panalian River at 1200. General Bruce\r\nordered the attacking force to continue north with the objective of\r\nreaching the ravine just south of the Camp Downes plateau. The 307th\r\nInfantry was to make the assault and employ if necessary all reserves,\r\nwhile the 2d Battalion of the 306th Infantry continued to be attached\r\nto the regiment in support. The 902d Field Artillery Battalion,\r\nCompany A of the 776th Amphibian Tank Battalion, and Company A\r\nof the 88th Chemical Weapons Battalion were also to continue their\r\nsupport. Farther south, the 305th Infantry would move north to defend\r\nthe bridgehead at the Baod River and the 77th Reconnaissance Troop\r\nwould move at 1330 to an area 500 yards north of the Panilahan River\r\nto clear out a position for the division command post. [945]\r\n\r\nUpon receiving its mission, a platoon from Company A of the 776th\r\nAmphibian Tank Battalion moved over water toward Camp Downes to secure\r\ninformation on the dispositions of the Japanese. The platoon proceeded\r\nnorth 500 yards offshore to the vicinity of Panalian Point where it\r\nreceived heavy enemy artillery fire from Camp Downes. The platoon\r\nreturned and reported the location of the enemy artillery. [946]\r\nThe 902d Field Artillery Battalion thereupon shelled the Japanese\r\nartillery positions. [947]\r\n\r\nThe assault units of the 307th Infantry steadily pushed out against\r\ndetermined opposition in which the enemy used rifles, mortars,\r\nand small artillery from dug-in positions along finger ridges and\r\nstreams. The Japanese had a prepared position 1,000 yards in depth from\r\nwhich they swept the rice fields which the troops had to traverse,\r\nbut fire from the American automatic weapons and mortars forced the\r\nJapanese to fall back. [948] An enemy company counterattacked and hit\r\nCompany A of the 88th Chemical Battalion. The Japanese were repulsed\r\non two separate occasions--the first time at 1320 and the second\r\nat 1520, when in company strength they charged the Americans. The\r\nchemical company stopped both charges with high explosive and white\r\nphosphorus shells. [949] The 307th Infantry pressed forward, capturing\r\nconsiderable quantities of small arms and artillery ammunition,\r\nand by nightfall had advanced some 2,000 yards. The 1st Battalion,\r\n306th Infantry, was to relieve the regiment's 2d Battalion, which\r\nhad been attached to the 307th Infantry as an assault battalion. [950]\r\n\r\nColonel Tanzola's 305th Infantry during the day protected the\r\nsouthern and southeastern flanks of the 77th Division in its advance\r\nnorthward. At night the regiment's defensive perimeter centered around\r\nIpil but extended as far south as the Baod River. [951]\r\n\r\nThe Japanese forces suffered greatly in the course of the day. The\r\ncommander of the Kamijo Battalion was severely wounded and the\r\nbattalion itself had many casualties. Consequently, the Tateishi\r\nand Maeda Battalions of the 12th Independent Infantry Regiment,\r\nwhich had been alerted to join the Kamijo Battalion, were ordered\r\nto take positions north of Ormoc, on the night of 9 December. [952]\r\nThe Japanese troops in the sector opposing the 77th Division were two\r\ncompanies totaling 100 men of the 1st Battalion, 12th Independent\r\nInfantry, with three machine guns and two battalion guns; three\r\ncompanies totaling 250 men of the 3d Battalion of the same regiment\r\nwith nine machine guns, two battalion guns, and four antitank\r\nguns; sixty men with three machine guns from the 30th Division; a\r\nparatroop unit of eighty men; a ship engineer unit of 500 men; and\r\n750 personnel from the Navy. The total effective military strength\r\nwas 1,740 men. [953]\r\n\r\nAt 0400 on 9 December the first resupply convoy arrived carrying with\r\nit the rest of the 306th Infantry. The 3d Battalion, 306th Infantry,\r\nwas placed on the eastern flank which connected the 305th Infantry on\r\nthe south with the 307th Infantry on the north. Its mission was to\r\nprotect the east and center of the beachhead. At 0530 the batteries\r\nof the 902d Field Artillery Battalion fired 110 rounds on a harassing\r\nmission and at 0820 they fired 192 rounds in preparation for the\r\nattack by the infantry against Camp Downes. [954] The 1st Battalion,\r\n306th Infantry, was to pass through the 2d Battalion, 306th Infantry,\r\nand continue the attack with the 3d Battalion, 307th Infantry,\r\non the left. The 1st Battalion, 307th Infantry, would protect the\r\nregimental right flank. [955] After the artillery concentration the\r\n307th Infantry at 0830 moved out toward Camp Downes.\r\n\r\nThe 307th Infantry inched slowly forward. It became evident that the\r\nJapanese had regrouped and emplaced the forces on ridges and high\r\nground which overlooked all possible approaches to Camp Downes and\r\nOrmoc, In selecting his defensive positions the enemy used \"excellent\r\njudgment\" [956] and defended the area with at least two companies\r\nheavily reinforced with automatic weapons. The assaulting forces\r\nreceived intense small arms and artillery fire. [957]\r\n\r\nThe 902d Field Artillery Battalion supported the attack from positions\r\nnorth of the Baod River. The 305th Field Artillery Battalion, which\r\nhad just arrived, was sent forward to support the attack. [958] At\r\none of the Japanese strong points that had been overrun were found\r\neleven heavy machine guns, two 40-mm. antiaircraft guns, and three\r\n75-mm. guns. At 1700, Japanese aircraft strafed the regiment and\r\ninflicted several casualties. At 1750, however, the 307th Infantry\r\nentered Camp Downes, secured the area, and established a night\r\nperimeter. Its total advance for the day was about one thousand\r\nyards. [959]\r\n\r\nAt 1245 the 305th Infantry, which had been protecting the southern\r\nflank of the division, received a new assignment from General\r\nBruce. The 2d Battalion of the 305th Infantry was to protect the\r\ndivision's rear by taking a position just south of Ipil. The 1st and\r\n3d Battalions were to move north of the Panilahan River and 1,000\r\nyards to the east in order to complete an all-around defense of\r\nCamp Downes. [960] At 1345 the battalions moved north. As soon as\r\nthe 307th Infantry entered Camp Downes, General Bruce ordered his\r\nforward command post into that area, and the advance echelon of his\r\nheadquarters moved out. Upon its arrival at the selected camp site,\r\na coconut grove on a hill just south of Camp Downes, the advance\r\nechelon became involved in a fire fight between the 307th Infantry\r\nand the enemy forces on the hill. It dug in under fire in the new\r\narea. The Japanese defenders were driven out of the coconut grove as\r\nthe rest of the command post moved in. [961]\r\n\r\nDuring the day the 307th Infantry had advanced about 1,000 yards\r\nand captured Camp Downes. The 305th Infantry had secured the area\r\nnortheast of Camp Downes and protected the northeastern flank of the\r\n77th Division. The 306th Infantry had moved into an assembly area\r\n600 yards north of Ipil. [962]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo Sevens are Rolled in Ormoc\r\n\r\nAt 1830 General Bruce issued verbal orders for the attack on\r\n10 December. Ormoc was the target. The 307th and 306th Infantry\r\nRegiments were to move out abreast. The 307th Infantry would attack\r\nalong the highway to its front while the 306th Infantry would move to\r\nthe northeast and attempt to envelop the opposing enemy force. The\r\n305th Infantry initially was to remain in position and defend its\r\npart of the line. [963]\r\n\r\nOrmoc, the largest and most important commercial center in western\r\nLeyte, possessed a concrete and pile pier at which a vessel with\r\na sixteen-foot draft, and two smaller vessels, could anchor at\r\nthe same time. [964] On the route to Ormoc and in the town itself,\r\nthe Japanese dug strong defensive positions. The favored sites were\r\nin bamboo thickets, on reverse slopes, along creek beds, and under\r\nbuildings. Individual spider holes about six feet deep were covered\r\nwith logs and earth and \"beautifully camouflaged.\" Against such\r\npositions, artillery and mortar fire did little more than daze the\r\ndefenders. Each position had to be searched out and destroyed. [965]\r\n\r\nOn 9 December the commander of the Japanese 35th Army ordered the\r\nfour companies of the 12th Independent Infantry Regiment to return\r\nto their regiment from positions north of Ipil and to be prepared to\r\nhelp defend the Ormoc area. [966]\r\n\r\nIn preparation for the assault against Ormoc, the 902d Field\r\nArtillery Battalion at 0830 established an observation post at Camp\r\nDownes. At 0920 the battalion fired 100 rounds of ammunition during\r\na ten-minute period in front of the area which the attacking forces\r\nwere to traverse. At 0930 the artillery fire was directed at enemy\r\npositions observed in Ormoc. [967] General Krueger made arrangements\r\nwith Admiral Kinkaid for LCM's, LCV's, and LVT's to operate along\r\nthe coast at dawn and nightfall for an indefinite period. [968]\r\n\r\nAt 0900, Company A of the 776th Amphibian Tank Battalion with its\r\n75-mm. howitzers moved into Ormoc--the first American troops to enter\r\nthe city. The 2d and 3d Platoons of the company moved through the\r\nstreets and sent high explosives and smoke shells into the buildings\r\noccupied by the Japanese. [969] The enemy defenders were also hit\r\nfrom the bay. LCM(R)'s from the Navy came overwater, moved near the\r\nOrmoc pier, and fired their rockets into the center of the town. As\r\nthe rockets were being fired, the crews of the LGM's engaged the enemy\r\ndefenders on the pier in a small arms fight, the antiaircraft machine\r\nguns on the LCM's exchanging fire with the Japanese rifles and machine\r\nguns. After the last of the rockets were launched the LCM's withdrew,\r\nstill under small arms fire. [970]\r\n\r\nColonel Smith's 306th Infantry was to move to the northeast with the\r\n1st and 3d Battalions abreast and forestall any attempt to reinforce\r\nthe Ormoc garrison. At 0945 the commanding officer of the 306th\r\nInfantry announced that both battalions had moved out on time. [971]\r\nThe 1st Battalion on the left encountered only light opposition during\r\nthe day. The 3d Battalion met light resistance in two deep ravines\r\nbut was able to push through without difficulty. Throughout the day,\r\nhowever, the regiment received harassing fire from well-concealed\r\nriflemen, each of whom generally worked alone. By 1600 the 1st\r\nBattalion was at a bridge on Highway 2 north of Ormoc and the\r\n3d Battalion was within 500 yards of the 1st but was slowed by\r\nthe necessity for maintaining contact with the regiment's 2d\r\nBattalion. This unit had been committed on the right in order to\r\nsecure contact with the 305th Infantry. [972]\r\n\r\nAt 0930 the troops of the 307th Infantry moved out. [973] They\r\nencountered little resistance until they neared the outskirts of Ormoc,\r\nwhere a deep ravine lay between the southern edge of the town and the\r\nfront lines of the advancing troops. An enemy force, which had dug in\r\non both sides and along the top of this ravine, had to be rooted out\r\nwith bayonets, grenades, and mortars. In spite of the determined enemy\r\nresistance, American casualties were very light. Entering the western\r\npart of the city, the 307th Infantry hit the front line of the Mitsui\r\nUnit on the left flank of the 12th Independent Infantry Regiment. [974]\r\n\r\nOrmoc \"was a blazing inferno of bursting white phosphorus shells,\r\nburning houses, and exploding ammunition dumps, and over it all hung\r\na pall of heavy smoke from burning dumps mixed with the gray dust\r\nof destroyed concrete buildings, blasted by ... artillery, mortar,\r\nand rocket fire.\" [975]\r\n\r\nThe 306th and 307th Infantry Regiments squeezed the enemy like a tube\r\nof toothpaste. The 306th Infantry enveloped the northeast flank, while\r\nthe drive of the 77th Division up the shore of Ormoc Bay banished any\r\nhopes that the Japanese might have entertained of escaping southeast\r\nby Highway 2. The Japanese were squeezed through Ormoc to the north.\r\n\r\nLeft behind, however, were some defenders who heroically but hopelessly\r\nfought to delay the American advance. Situated in spider holes beneath\r\nthe buildings, they stubbornly fought back until overcome. Street by\r\nstreet, house by house, the 307th Infantry cleared Ormoc, which was\r\na scene of gutted buildings and rubble. Many ammunition and signal\r\nsupply dumps were captured, including a church that had been filled\r\nwith artillery and small arms ammunition. [976]\r\n\r\nAs his troops were reducing Ormoc, General Bruce made a report to the\r\ncommanding general of the XXIV Corps on the status of the attack and\r\nreferred to a promise that had been made by the commanding general of\r\nthe Fifth Air Force: \"Where is the case of Scotch that was promised\r\nby General Whitehead for the capture of Ormoc. I don't drink but I\r\nhave an assistant division commander and regimental commanders who\r\ndo....\" [977]\r\n\r\nAt the same time that the 77th Division was entering Ormoc, the 32d\r\nDivision was pushing southward toward Ormoc Valley, the 11th Airborne\r\nDivision was working westward over the mountains toward the town, and\r\nthe 7th Division was pushing northward along the eastern coast of Ormoc\r\nBay in an attempt to make a juncture with the 77th Division. General\r\nBruce advised General Hodge: \"Have rolled two sevens in Ormoc. Come\r\nseven come eleven.\" [978]\r\n\r\nThe 307th Infantry pushed through the town and at 1730 established\r\na night perimeter on the banks of the Antilao River on the western\r\nedge of Ormoc where it tied in with the front line of the 306th\r\nInfantry. At long last, Ormoc was in American hands.\r\n\r\nIn its drive north the 77th Division killed an estimated 1,506 Japanese\r\nand took 7 prisoners. [979] Its own casualties were 123 men killed,\r\n329 wounded, and 13 missing in action. [980]\r\n\r\nOn 7 December, the 7th Division moved north from its position about\r\nseven miles south of Deposito to join the 77th Division, which\r\nhad landed that day at Deposito. It advanced with two regiments\r\nabreast--the 184th Infantry on the left and the 17th Infantry on\r\nthe right. The regiments made slow progress as they pushed over a\r\nseries of hills and river valleys. On the night of 9-10 December the\r\nJapanese who were caught between the 7th and 77th Divisions withdrew\r\ninto the mountains. At 1000 on 11 December an advance element, the\r\n2d Battalion, 184th Infantry, reached Ipil and established contact\r\nwith the 77th Division.\r\n\r\nThe XXIV Corps was now in undisputed control of the eastern shore\r\nof Ormoc Bay and the town of Ormoc. The capture of Ormoc had very\r\nimportant effects. It divided the Japanese forces and isolated\r\nthe remaining elements of the enemy 26th Division. It drew off and\r\ndestroyed heretofore uncommitted enemy reserves, thus relieving the\r\nsituation on all other fronts, and it hastened the juncture of the\r\nX Corps with the forces of the XXIV Corps. It denied to the Japanese\r\nthe use of Ormoc as a port, through which so many reinforcements and\r\nsupplies had been poured into the campaign. Finally, the Japanese were\r\nunable to use Highway 2 south of Ormoc and were driven north up Ormoc\r\nValley. [981] General Krueger had realized an important part of his\r\nplan for the seizure of Ormoc Valley, since sealing off the port of\r\nOrmoc would enable the Sixth Army to devote its major effort toward\r\ncompletion of that plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nBattle of the Airstrips\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediately after Pearl Harbor, American submarines began to attack\r\nJapanese shipping to the Netherlands Indies. From the beginning they\r\nwere successful. In September 1943 the submarines accelerated the\r\ntempo of their attack. The Japanese lost to the submarines \"tremendous\r\ntonnages of shipping ... all over the ocean. No route was secure from\r\ntheir attack; no ship was safe south of Honshu.\" [982] By the early\r\nfall of 1944 the Japanese line of communications to the Netherlands\r\nIndies was virtually cut.\r\n\r\nWith American land-based air strength on Leyte increasing steadily,\r\na strong possibility existed that the line of communications between\r\nthe Japanese homeland and the South Pacific area would be completely\r\nsevered, especially if the main American air force should move up from\r\nNew Guinea to Leyte. Imperial General Headquarters felt, therefore,\r\nthat the Dulag and Tacloban airfields must be neutralized, and the\r\nBurauen airfields in southern Leyte Valley seized before the American\r\nair force could establish itself in strength on the island. Japanese\r\ncontrol of the airfields would also facilitate the movement of Japanese\r\nsupplies to the island and greatly assist the ground operations of\r\nthe 35th Army. [983]\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of November, Gen. Tomoyuki Yamashita, commanding\r\ngeneral of the 14th Area Army, sent a liaison officer from his\r\nheadquarters in Manila with orders to Lt. Gen. Sosaku Suzuki, the\r\n35th Army commander, at Ormoc. General Yamashita is quoted as saying:\r\n\"If the construction of air bases on Leyte is permitted to continue,\r\nthe communications between the Southern areas and the homeland will be\r\ncut and this would be a serious situation. Therefore, we must occupy\r\nBurauen airfield as soon as possible and at the same time neutralize\r\nTacloban and Dulag airfields. Moreover, we must annihilate the enemy's\r\nair power.\" [984]\r\n\r\nTherefore, in a desperate attempt to gain the initiative, the Japanese\r\nembarked on a rash scheme to seize the airfields of Leyte. Their\r\nplan entailed a co-ordinated effort by both the ground and air\r\nforces. Beginning on 23 November and continuing through 27 November,\r\nthe army air force was to launch a campaign to eliminate American air\r\nresistance. On the night of 26 November, aircraft carrying specially\r\ntrained demolitionists were to crash-land on the Dulag and Tacloban\r\nairstrips and put them out of commission. [985]\r\n\r\nPlans were made for the 3d and 4th Airborne Raiding Regiments to\r\ndescend from Luzon on the Burauen airfields. The 26th Division,\r\ntogether with the 16th Division, which had fought the Americans in\r\nLeyte Valley, and the 68th Independent Mixed Brigade of the 35th Army\r\nwere to infiltrate through the mountains and attack and capture the\r\nBurauen airfields. The 16th Division was to move from its position\r\nin the mountains west of Dagami toward Buri, the northernmost of the\r\nBurauen airfields. Elements of the 26th Division which were engaging\r\nthe 7th Division on the shores of Ormoc Bay were to break off the\r\nfight, move over the mountains, and attack Bayug and San Pablo, the\r\nsouthernmost of the Burauen fields. (Map 20) If all went well they\r\nwere to proceed east and capture the Dulag airfield, on the shores\r\nof Leyte Gulf. The airborne assault was to be made on the night of\r\n5 December. The ground troops were to arrive early on the morning of\r\n6 December and assist in the attack.\r\n\r\nBecause he felt that he had not made sufficient preparation, General\r\nSuzuki requested that the attack be postponed until 7 December. General\r\nYamashita disapproved this request, but since bad weather was forecast\r\nfor 5 December, he sent a message to General Suzuki changing the date\r\nof attack to the night of 6 December. This information was immediately\r\ntransmitted to the 26th Division. At the same time, efforts were\r\nmade by General Suzuki's headquarters to relay the information to\r\nthe 16th Division, but because of radio difficulties General Makino\r\nnever received the message.\r\n\r\nGeneral Makino, after receiving the order for the airborne attack on\r\nthe night of 5 December to be followed with an attack by his forces\r\non the following morning, concentrated the remaining strength of the\r\n16th Division into one battalion. General Suzuki personally took\r\ncommand of the Burauen operation, and on 1 December he and a part\r\nof his staff moved east into the mountains near Burauen. General\r\nTomochika was left in command of the Ormoc forces. [986]\r\n\r\nUnwittingly, the Japanese were flogging a dead horse. General Krueger\r\nhad stopped all work on these airfields on 25 November.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American Dispositions\r\n\r\nThe Sixth Army planners for the Leyte operation had not envisaged the\r\nemployment of the 11th Airborne Division during the campaign. This\r\ndivision, commanded by Maj. Gen. Joseph M. Swing, was to have staged\r\non Leyte for subsequent operations. [987]\r\n\r\nOn 22 November, however, General Hodge ordered the relief of the 7th\r\nDivision, minus the 17th Infantry, by the 11th Airborne Division in\r\norder to free the 7th Division for the drive up the eastern shore of\r\nOrmoc Bay. On the same day the 11th Airborne Division, along with\r\nthe 17th Infantry, less the 2d Battalion, was ordered to seize and\r\nsecure all exits from the mountains into Leyte Valley in its area. The\r\ndivision was then to advance through the central mountain range,\r\nand secure the western exits from the mountains in order to assist\r\nthe attack of the 7th Infantry Division in its drive north toward\r\nOrmoc. [988] Upon receipt of this order, General Swing assigned to\r\nthe units of the 11th Airborne Division the mission of securing the\r\nmountain exits.\r\n\r\nGeneral Swing immediately started to relieve elements of the 7th\r\nDivision and by 28 November the relief was completed. For several days\r\nthe 11th Airborne Division sent patrols to the west and maintained\r\nsmall security guards at the Buri and Bayug airfields.\r\n\r\nThere were three airstrips--San Pablo, Bayug, and Buri--north of the\r\nDulag-Burauen road in the area between San Pablo and Burauen. Both\r\nthe Bayug and San Pablo airfields were on the Dulag-Burauen road. The\r\nBuri airstrip was almost directly north of the Bayug airstrip. The\r\nland between the Bayug and Buri airstrips was flat for a distance\r\nof about 800 yards. The northern half of this flat land was a swamp,\r\nsometimes five feet in depth. At the northern end of the swamp was a\r\nnarrow stream, about fifteen feet wide, which ran along the base of a\r\nplateau. This plateau, which was directly north of the Buri airfield,\r\nwas forested with palm trees and jungle growth. Buri airfield lay\r\nbetween the swamp and the plateau. [989]\r\n\r\nBy 27 November information from captured documents and prisoners\r\ninterrogated by units of the Sixth Army indicated that the enemy\r\nwas planning a co-ordinated ground and airborne attack to seize the\r\nairfields in the Burauen area. The intelligence officers of the XXIV\r\nCorps, however, thought that the Japanese were not capable of putting\r\nthis assault plan into effect. The American patrols operating west\r\nof Burauen had found no new trails being constructed nor any old\r\nones being extensively used. Furthermore, the American forces had\r\nblocked all known trails leading east over the mountains into the\r\narea. Although the enemy might be able to make an airborne attack,\r\n\"he is not at this time capable of launching a co-ordinated ground\r\nairborne attack of major proportions in the Burauen area.\" [990]\r\n\r\nDespite the trail blocks, however, elements of the 16th Division were\r\nable to descend upon the Buri airstrip from the mountains southwest\r\nof Dagami. Only one battalion of the 26th Division, which was to\r\nhave attacked the airfields in the Burauen area on 7 December, ever\r\nreached the area. The movement over the mountains was difficult, and\r\nit was not until the night of 10-11 December that the unit arrived\r\nwest of Burauen. It made a half-hearted attack, which was repulsed\r\nby elements of the 11th Airborne Division. [991]\r\n\r\nAlthough the intelligence officers of the XXIV Corps believed there\r\nwas no possibility of a co-ordinated ground and aerial assault,\r\nGeneral Hodge alerted the XXIV Corps to a possible enemy paratroop\r\nlanding. All units were directed to strengthen local defenses and\r\nestablish in each sector a twenty-four-hour watching post. All men\r\nwere to be armed and wear helmets, or to have arms and helmets within\r\nreach at all times. In the event of any unusual enemy activity, the\r\nheadquarters of the XXIV Corps was to be notified immediately. [992]\r\n\r\nIn order to protect the airfields more adequately, a company of the\r\n77th Division was furnished to the 11th Airborne Division to defend the\r\nDulag airfield, while the latter division held one battalion alerted\r\nat Burauen in readiness to move against hostile forces at any of the\r\nthree airfields in the area. [993] One battalion of the 306th Infantry\r\nRegiment and a platoon each from Companies A and B of the 767th Tank\r\nBattalion were stationed north of Burauen; the regiment was to be\r\nprepared to assemble two companies near the headquarters of the Fifth\r\nAir Force for motor movement in defense against airborne attack, and\r\nto maintain security detachments at the Bayug and Buri airstrips. [994]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst Japanese Effort\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the first phase of the Japanese plan to regain\r\nthe initiative had begun. At 0245 on 27 November, three enemy air\r\ntransports with lights on flew over Leyte Gulf at an altitude of about\r\nfifty feet. Ten minutes later one of these aircraft crash-landed in\r\nthe water about twenty-five yards offshore in the area of the 728th\r\nAmphibian Tractor Battalion, which was about two miles south of Rizal\r\nand about three miles north of Tarragona.\r\n\r\nA guard from the battalion, assuming the plane to be friendly,\r\napproached it and climbed on the wing to offer assistance. The Japanese\r\nemerged from the plane and threw grenades at the guard. The men of\r\nthe tractor battalion, hearing the noise, came on and killed two\r\nJapanese with small arms fire. Three others, however, escaped and\r\nreached a swamp west of the landing point. Ten or twelve more of the\r\nenemy moved south along the beach in the surf and also disappeared\r\ninto the swamp. [995]\r\n\r\nOne of the other two planes crash-landed on the Buri airstrip and all\r\nits occupants were killed. The remaining plane crashed on the beach\r\nnear the Bito River, north of Abuyog. Opposite, across the river,\r\nelements of the 11th Airborne Division were encamped. [996] With the\r\nexception of one soldier, who was killed at dawn, all of the Japanese\r\nin this plane escaped. The 728th Amphibian Tractor Battalion found many\r\ndemolition charges abandoned in the plane. In view of this discovery,\r\nand the fact that the enemy made no attempt to follow up the landing\r\nby an airborne attack in force, the Americans concluded that the\r\nJapanese were on a suicide mission of demolition and destruction in\r\nthe Dulag and Burauen airfield areas. Although the operation caused\r\nno damage, Radio Tokyo informed the Japanese people that it was\r\n\"most successful.\" If the enemy believed that his attempt had been\r\nsuccessful, however, the possibility existed that other airborne\r\ntroops would be landed, either as raiding parties or in force. [997]\r\n\r\nBy 5 December the XXIV Corps was lulled into a sense of false\r\nsecurity. The 2d Battalion, 511th Parachute Infantry, which had been\r\nin the Burauen area, had rejoined its regiment, which was fighting\r\nfor the mountain passes on the trail to Albuera. The 3d Battalion,\r\n306th Infantry, on the northwestern approaches to the airfields,\r\nreverted on 5 December to the control of the 77th Infantry Division,\r\nwhich was embarking for the Ormoc operation. The only infantry unit\r\nin the Burauen area at the time of the Japanese attack was the 1st\r\nBattalion, 187th Glider Infantry (less one company), which was on San\r\nPablo airfield. The G-2 periodic report on 5 December at 2000 stated\r\nwith regard to the general situation in the Burauen-Dagami-Mount Alto\r\narea: \"An examination of reports of action in this area since 1 Nov\r\nmay well warrant the assumption that organized resistance has about\r\nceased.\" [998] But before morning, the remnants of the Japanese 16th\r\nDivision hit the Buri airfield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBattle of Buri Airstrip\r\n\r\nOn or about 2 December General Makino, commanding general of the\r\n16th Division, had assembled from the hills southwest of Dagami the\r\nremaining elements of the division. The total strength thus massed\r\nwas only about 500 men. The men rested, and then marched on toward\r\nthe Buri airstrip. On the way, American artillery and tank fire\r\nkilled approximately 200 of them. The remaining force moved to a new\r\nlocation--a deep gorge about 6,500 yards southwest of Dagami. On\r\n5 December, this force was to move out of the gorge, join the\r\nparatroopers, and launch a combined assault against the Buri airstrip.\r\n\r\nThe Americans later learned from interrogated prisoners that the morale\r\nof the men of the 16th Division was very low at that time. They were\r\nliving on coconuts and bananas, since the officers had taken the few\r\nremaining rations. Wounded men in the force had been abandoned. [999]\r\n\r\nThe 16th Division was still unaware that the target date for the\r\nBurauen operation had been postponed to the night of 6 December, and\r\nconsequently proceeded with its plans to attack the Buri airstrip on\r\n6 December at 0630--over fourteen hours before the paratroopers were\r\nscheduled to land. On the night of 5-6 December, approximately 150\r\nJapanese made their way quietly toward the Buri airstrip.\r\n\r\nAt 0600, the 287th Field Artillery Observation Battalion, northwest\r\nof Burauen, saw elements of the Japanese 16th Division crossing the\r\nmain road south of the battalion's position and heading east toward\r\nthe Buri field. The battalion immediately relayed this information\r\nto the XXIV Corps headquarters. [1000] After crossing the road, the\r\nenemy moved into the swamp near the airfield. One Japanese unit of\r\nabout 15 men, armed with a machine gun, stationed itself at a Filipino\r\nshack 300 yards west of the highway in order to cover the road. [1001]\r\n\r\nAt the Buri strip were about 47 men from the 287th Field Artillery\r\nObservation Battalion and 157 miscellaneous troops. [1002] Small\r\nunits of engineering troops and a signal company were at the foot of\r\nthe bluff, on the northern edge of the strip.\r\n\r\nAt 0630, the 16th Division launched its surprise attack. Led by a\r\nFilipino, [1003] the Japanese broke into the American bivouac area\r\nwhile the men were still asleep. Some were bayoneted while in their\r\nblankets, or before they could seize their weapons. Others held the\r\nJapanese off until they could retreat, shoeless and in their shorts\r\nand undershirts, either up the bluff to the headquarters of the V\r\nBomber Command, or to the road, where an infantry company had come up\r\nin support. [1004] The service troops were \"firing at everything that\r\nmoves and ... probably inflicting casualties among our troops.\" [1005]\r\nThe Japanese from the 16th Division entrenched themselves in the\r\nwoods north of the airstrip.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, General Hodge ordered that the 1st Battalion, 382d Infantry,\r\nbe released from the 96th Division and placed under the operational\r\ncontrol of General Swing of the 11th Airborne Division. The battalion\r\nwas to proceed immediately to the aid of the two companies of the 11th\r\nAirborne Division in the Buri airfield area. General Hodge emphasized\r\nthat the area was \"critical\" and \"must be kept closed.\" It would be\r\n\"dangerous\" to let the enemy \"get into the service troops along the\r\nroad and around airfields.\" [1006] One reinforced company of the 1st\r\nBattalion was already in the area and the rest of the battalion made\r\nready to follow. [1007]\r\n\r\nSmall patrols of combat troops held the enemy forces in check. At\r\n1030 one patrol killed seventeen Japanese north of the Buri airfield,\r\nand another killed three of the enemy west of the airstrip. The\r\n1st Battalion of the 187th Glider Infantry was moved from the San\r\nPablo airfield to the Buri area and went into position near the\r\nairfield. [1008] By 1800 on 6 December, the enemy had been driven\r\noff the Buri airfield, though pockets of resistance still remained\r\non the edges of the airstrip. The battalion encountered a portion of\r\nthe 16th Division east of the strip and destroyed it. [1009] Forty\r\nof the enemy were known to be dead, and it was believed that as many\r\nmore had also been killed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttack From the Sky\r\n\r\nSan Pablo Airstrip\r\n\r\nThe Japanese air transports were scheduled to be over the airfields\r\nat 1840 on 6 December, with an escort of fighter aircraft. Fighters\r\nwere to neutralize the airstrips and, just before the paratroopers\r\njumped, medium bombers were to strafe the Buri, San Pablo, and Bayug\r\nairstrips. At the same time light bombers were to hit antiaircraft\r\npositions between San Pablo and Dulag and points west. Fifty-one\r\naircraft in all (transports, bombers, and fighters) were assigned to\r\nthe operation. The transports were allotted as follows: twenty to the\r\nBuri airstrip, nine to San Pablo airstrip, six to Bayug airstrip,\r\nand two each to the Tacloban and Dulag airstrips. Each transport\r\ncarried fifteen to twenty men. [1010]\r\n\r\nThe Japanese parachutists were well drilled as to their mission. The\r\noperation was to be divided into five phases. The first phase was to\r\nbegin with the jump-off. The men, immediately after landing, were to\r\nattack and destroy aircraft on the ground, and one element was to\r\nattack the barracks and communications. This phase was to end when\r\nthe moon rose. In the second phase, ending about 2230, the troops\r\nwould destroy matériel, ammunition dumps, bridges, and remaining\r\nbarracks. During the third phase, from 2330 to 0300, the paratroopers\r\nwere to destroy the remaining aircraft and installations. In the\r\nfourth phase, lasting from 0300 to 0600, they were to build defensive\r\npositions. In the fifth phase, from 0600 on, preparations were to be\r\nmade for future operations.\r\n\r\nThere were to be three assault waves. The first wave would consist\r\nof the headquarters unit with approximately 25 men; the signal\r\nunit with 7; the 1st Company with 100; the 2d Company with 86; the\r\nconstruction company with 97; and a platoon with 50 men. The second\r\nwould be composed of 9 men from the headquarters unit; the 3d Company;\r\nthe Heavy Weapons Company; and the signal unit. The final wave would\r\nconsist of the remaining troops--about 80 men. [1011]\r\n\r\nJust before dark, thirty-nine Japanese transports with supporting\r\nbombers and fighters roared over the Burauen airfields. Several\r\nincendiary bombs fell on the San Pablo strip, setting a gasoline\r\ndump afire and burning a liaison plane. Approximately eighteen enemy\r\naircraft were shot down. Parachutists began to descend from the\r\ntransports. The commander of the 3d Regiment with about 60 of his\r\nmen dropped on the Buri strip, while between 250 and 300 parachutists\r\nlanded near the San Pablo strip. [1012]\r\n\r\nThe parachutists, immediately after landing, ran up the north and south\r\nsides of the San Pablo strip. They talked in loud tones and allegedly\r\ncalled out in English, \"Hello--where are your machine guns?\" Most of\r\nthe enemy forces assembled on the north side of the airstrip. They\r\nburned three or four more liaison planes, a jeep, several tents,\r\nand another gasoline dump, throwing ammunition on the latter.\r\n\r\nThe only American troops in the area, a small detachment of the 11th\r\nAirborne Division, consisted of elements of the 127th Airborne Engineer\r\nBattalion, the signal company, Headquarters Battery of the division\r\nartillery, special troops as well as Air Corps service troops. During\r\nthe night of 6-7 December, confusion reigned on the airstrip. There\r\nwas uncontrolled and disorganized firing and much difficulty arose\r\nin establishing a co-ordinated command. [1013]\r\n\r\nAt dawn, after most of the paratroopers had assembled on the San Pablo\r\nairfield, they moved north and west to the northern edge of the Buri\r\nairstrip and joined elements of the 16th Division.\r\n\r\nAt the San Pablo airstrip, Lt. Col. Douglas C. Davis, the commanding\r\nofficer of the 127th Airborne Engineer Battalion, organized the\r\nmiscellaneous service troops into an infantry unit to protect the\r\nSan Pablo airstrip. The 674th Parachute Field Artillery Battalion,\r\nwhich was at the mouth of the Bito River, north of Abuyog, was to\r\nleave its guns at that place and come to the assistance of Colonel\r\nDavis' force. At daylight, the troops of the 127th Airborne Engineer\r\nBattalion moved out toward the airstrip and met the 674th Field\r\nArtillery Battalion, under Col. Lukas E. Hoska. The artillery battalion\r\nswung into line and the two units moved out as a provisional infantry\r\nregiment under Colonel Davis--the airborne engineers on the left and\r\nthe artillery battalion on the right.\r\n\r\nThey encountered strong resistance to the west of the San Pablo\r\nairstrip. After advancing north of the strip, the engineers ran\r\nout of ammunition. The field artillery battalion went forward to a\r\ncoconut grove, also to the north of the airstrip. The gap between\r\nthe two units was closed by a strong patrol. Since the food and\r\nammunition situation remained uncertain, the composite force went\r\ninto a perimeter in defense of San Pablo strip, where it remained\r\nfor the next few days. [1014]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBuri Airstrip\r\n\r\nOn the night of 6-7 December, the Air Corps service personnel had\r\nabruptly quitted the Buri airfield, leaving behind carbines, rifles,\r\ngrenades, small arms ammunition, and machine guns. 2d Lt. Rudolph\r\nMamula of the 767th Tank Battalion had been ordered to take charge\r\nof the situation, co-ordinate the action of forces on the airstrip,\r\nand recover abandoned armament and ammunition. Apparently he was\r\nunsuccessful, because later in the day the Japanese made \"the best\r\nuse\" of the same arms and ammunition. By the middle of the morning,\r\non 7 December, the enemy had completely occupied the Buri airstrip.\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of the landing of Japanese paratroopers, General\r\nKrueger had requested General MacArthur to release elements of the 38th\r\nDivision for employment against the enemy airborne troops. The 38th\r\nDivision had arrived on Leyte to stage for future operations. General\r\nHeadquarters assigned the 149th Infantry to the control of the\r\ncommanding general of the Sixth Army; two battalions of the 149th\r\nInfantry were in turn released on 6 December to the control of General\r\nHodge, the commanding general of XXIV Corps, who put them under the\r\noperational control of the 11th Airborne Division for employment\r\nagainst parachutists in the Burauen area. The remaining battalion of\r\nthe 149th Infantry was alerted for the movement in the Burauen area\r\non twenty-four hours' notice. [1015]\r\n\r\nThe 1st and 2d Battalions of the 149th Infantry, 38th Division,\r\nwere alerted at 0200 on 7 December for movement to the San Pablo\r\nairstrip. The advance elements of the 1st Battalion were greeted at\r\nthe San Pablo airstrip by General Swing, who is reported to have\r\nsaid: \"Glad to see you. I am General Swing of the 11th Airborne\r\nDivision. We've been having a hell of a time here. Last night\r\napproximately seventy-five Jap paratroopers dropped on us of which\r\nwe have accounted for about fifty. Fifteen hundred yards from here\r\non an azimuth of 273° is another airstrip just like this one. Between\r\nhere and there are about twenty-five Jap troopers. It is now 1400. I\r\nwant that strip secure by nightfall.\" [1016]\r\n\r\nThe commanding officer of the 1st Battalion decided to attack with\r\nCompanies A and C abreast, Company A on the right, with approximately\r\na 200-yard frontage for each company. A section of heavy machine guns\r\nwas attached to each unit, and a platoon of 81-mm. mortars from Company\r\nD was to support the attack from positions on the San Pablo airstrip.\r\n\r\nMoving out at 1430, the troops covered the first 400 yards without\r\nincident but were stopped by a rain-swollen swamp. Since attempts to\r\nbypass the swamp were fruitless, the men were forced to go through\r\nit. The water was shoulder-high in places, and the companies lost\r\ncontact during the crossing. Company A proceeded to the Buri\r\nairstrip, arriving there about 1630. Company C, which had been\r\ndelayed by a slight skirmish with the enemy, did not arrive until\r\nabout 1800. Because of the lateness of the hour and the fact that\r\nobservation had shown there were \"many more Japanese\" on the north of\r\nthe airstrip than had been estimated by General Swing, it was decided\r\nto establish perimeters for the night. [1017]\r\n\r\nBy the end of 7 December the 1st Battalion, 149th Infantry,\r\nhad established a toe hold on the southwestern fringe of the Buri\r\nstrip. During the day the 1st Battalion, 187th Infantry, northwest of\r\nthe Bayug airstrip, had received machine gun fire from an estimated\r\nenemy platoon just west of the Burauen-Dagami road. This enemy force\r\nwas contained throughout the day as advances were made southeast toward\r\nthe Buri airstrip. At 1630 the 1st Battalion, 187th Infantry, and the\r\n1st Battalion, 149th Infantry, established contact at the western end\r\nof the Buri airstrip. The 1st Battalion, 382d Infantry, 96th Division,\r\nhad been placed under the control of the 11th Airborne Division. At\r\ndusk of 7 December, it took a position near the 1st Battalion,\r\n149th Infantry. [1018] At 2000 the sector was reported quiet. It\r\nwas impossible to estimate the total number of American and Japanese\r\ncasualties for the day, but it was believed to be large. [1019]\r\n\r\nDuring the night of 7-8 December, the Japanese brought forward two\r\nmachine guns and emplaced them directly in front of Company A of the\r\n1st Battalion, 382d Infantry. At dawn the machine guns opened up. Their\r\nlow, grazing fire pinned down the company, but Pfc. Warren G. Perkins,\r\nin the face of enemy bullets, located the guns and called mortar fire\r\nupon the site. The mortar concentration, falling within fifty yards of\r\nPerkins, silenced the machine guns and startled the Japanese. Pvt. Ova\r\nA. Kelley took advantage of the confusion and charged with his M1 rifle\r\nand a carbine. Kelley killed eight of the enemy before he himself was\r\nslain. [1020] The rest of Company A followed Kelley and secured the\r\nedge of the airstrip where it set up a perimeter. During 8 December\r\nthe Americans consolidated their positions.\r\n\r\nAt 1045 on 9 December the 1st Battalion, 149th Infantry, attacked\r\nnorth with Companies A, B, and C on a line. The companies got across\r\nthe airstrip but then came under fire from Japanese weapons emplaced\r\non high ground to the north. The 1st Battalion therefore withdrew to\r\nthe southern edge of the strip. During the day it had killed fifty\r\nof an enemy force estimated to consist of two hundred men. The 2d\r\nBattalion remained in position throughout the day. [1021]\r\n\r\nAt twilight the assault companies of the 1st Battalion, 382d Infantry,\r\nwere sent out in various directions to locate enemy patrols said\r\nto be converging upon the airfield. Only a few mortar men and\r\nheadquarters personnel were left behind to guard the perimeters. At\r\nmidnight approximately 150 Japanese attacked. The headquarters\r\nand service troops with rifle fire, together with the mortar men,\r\nstopped the charge. They killed fifty of the enemy and suffered seven\r\ncasualties. [1022]\r\n\r\nOn 10 December, after a half-hour artillery concentration, the 1st\r\nBattalion, 149th Infantry, attacked with Companies A and C abreast,\r\nand Company B in the rear. After the 1st Battalion had pushed north\r\n300 yards across the airstrip, Companies A and C moved northwest\r\nwhile Company B went to the northeast. The companies cleared the\r\nairfield area of individual riflemen and destroyed small pockets of\r\nenemy resistance. The 1st Battalion went into perimeter at 1700 on\r\nthe Buri airstrip. The 2d Battalion remained in position throughout\r\nthe day. [1023]\r\n\r\nAt 1930 the Japanese launched their final concentrated attack against\r\nthe airfields. They began to fire at the administration buildings of\r\nthe Fifth Air Force, and some of the bullets went through the plywood\r\nwalls of the house of Maj. Gen. Ennis C. Whitehead. \"The General\r\nducked a bullet, ordered someone to find out who the blankety-blank\r\nwas responsible and that he'd blankety-blank better stop or think up\r\na blankety-blank good reason.\" [1024]\r\n\r\nA staff officer immediately started to investigate the situation. He\r\ngot Lt. Col. Paul V. Kaessner of the 8th Aviation Signal Battalion on\r\nthe telephone. The following conversation is reported to have ensued:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Colonel,\" he said sternly, \"you've got to stop that promiscuous\r\n    firing down there immediately!\"\r\n\r\n    \"Like to, sir,\" answered the colonel, \"but the Japs....\"\r\n\r\n    \"Japs,\" shouted the staff officer, \"that can't be Japs. That fire\r\n    is coming from our fifties.\"\r\n\r\n    \"That's right ... and the Japs are doing the shooting!\"\r\n\r\n    \"Where in the hell did the Japs get our machine guns?\"\r\n\r\n    \"How in hell should I know, sir?\"\r\n\r\n    \"The bullets are coming right through the general's quarters.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Tell the general to get down on the floor. Incidentally, that\r\n    yelling you hear is a Banzai raid on our mess hall.\" [1025]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe air force personnel were pushed back until they reached the\r\nhospital, where they halted and held. They then counterattacked and\r\ndrove the enemy away from the area. The Japanese left thirty of their\r\ndead behind them.\r\n\r\nThis action was the last major effort of the Japanese against the\r\nBurauen airfields. Only a little more than a battalion of the 26th\r\nDivision, which was to have assisted the 16th Division, managed\r\nto reach the airstrips, and it had arrived in a very disorganized\r\ncondition. Immediately afterward, General Suzuki, the commanding\r\ngeneral of the 35th Army, learned that the 77th Division had landed\r\njust below Ormoc on the eastern coast of Ormoc Bay. Since Ormoc was the\r\nsouthern entrance to Ormoc Valley, it was highly important that the\r\ntown be defended at all costs. General Suzuki therefore ordered that\r\nthe operations against the Burauen airfields be discontinued and that\r\nall troops repair to Ormoc Valley. The return through the mountains\r\nwas difficult. Nearly all organization was lost, and the Japanese made\r\ntheir way back through the mountains as scattered individuals. [1026]\r\n\r\nThe air transports allotted to Tacloban were destroyed by antiaircraft\r\nfire, while those destined for Dulag crash-landed, killing all their\r\noccupants. [1027]\r\n\r\nThe Japanese had failed to achieve any major objective. Though\r\nthey had destroyed minor fuel and supply dumps and a few American\r\naircraft, delayed airfield construction, and isolated Fifth Air\r\nForce headquarters for five days, they had not appreciably delayed\r\nthe Leyte operation. [1028]\r\n\r\nThe Japanese attempt to take the initiative away from the Americans\r\nhad failed. The Sixth Army was at the northern and southern entrances\r\nto Ormoc Valley. Elements of the X Corps had been battering for a\r\nlong time at the northern portal. With the capture of Ormoc, the\r\nXXIV Corps had sprung the lock on the southern doorway and was in a\r\nposition to drive north and thus relieve some of the pressure being\r\nexerted against the X Corps.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the XXIV Corps at the entrance to Ormoc Valley brought\r\nthe critical logistical situation on the island of Leyte to the\r\nfore. The tenuous supply line already had been stretched very thin,\r\nand, with the 77th Division extending its lines, a strong possibility\r\nexisted that it might snap altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nLogistics\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conquest of Leyte was taking longer than had been anticipated. The\r\ndecision of the Japanese to make Leyte the decisive battleground\r\nof the Philippines had forced the Americans to commit not only the\r\nreserve 32d and 77th Infantry Divisions but also the 112th Cavalry\r\nRegimental Combat Team, the 11th Airborne Division, and elements of\r\nthe 38th Infantry Division. The inability of the Americans to establish\r\nconsiderable land-based air forces on Leyte, as well as the unexpected\r\nJapanese reinforcement program, had retarded the campaign. Not only\r\nwas the timetable of future operations in the Pacific upset, but a\r\nstrong possibility existed that it would not be feasible to establish\r\na major logistical and air base on the island--the primary purpose\r\nof the operation.\r\n\r\nThe construction program on Leyte was hampered by conflicting\r\npriorities and, as had been foreseen, very poor terrain, bad weather\r\nconditions, and a shortage of service personnel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConstruction\r\n\r\nRetelling the disagreements and describing the conflicts that arose\r\nover the everchanging needs of the Army, Navy, and Air Forces would\r\nbe involved, tedious, and unprofitable. But the progress of the\r\nconstruction program must be recounted, since it had direct bearing\r\nnot only on the Leyte Campaign but also on the Mindoro and Luzon\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAirfields\r\n\r\nThe importance of the development of the airfields cannot be\r\noveremphasized. The inability of the Sixth Army to meet its\r\nconstruction dates on the airstrips, because of poor soil conditions\r\nand heavy rains, prevented the U. S. forces from stopping the flow\r\nof Japanese reinforcements and made it impossible for the Allied\r\nAir Forces to give sufficient land-based air support to the ground\r\ntroops. It also forced a postponement of the Mindoro operation. It\r\nis well, therefore, to summarize just what had been accomplished in\r\nairfield construction.\r\n\r\nWork on the Tacloban airstrip had been handicapped at first by the\r\nheavy concentration of troops, supplies, and equipment in the area\r\nduring the early stages of the operation. Thereafter, work was further\r\nhampered by the insufficient supply of coral for surfacing the runway\r\nand by the very heavy traffic concentrated on the haul road because of\r\nthe necessity for unloading cargo over White Beach. By 25 December,\r\n1 runway, 50 dispersal areas, 536,000 square feet of alert apron,\r\n1 diagonal taxiway, 1 parallel dispersal taxiway, and 8,943 feet of\r\nadditional dispersal taxiways had been constructed.\r\n\r\nThe Dulag airfield was located on the flat flood plain of the Marabang\r\nRiver. The difficulties encountered were numerous: time lost because\r\nof excessive rains that amounted to thirty-five inches in forty days;\r\nair alerts; very poor drainage, which required the construction of\r\na system of drag-line trenches to the river; and very poor access\r\nroads. The access roads required an excessive expenditure of time,\r\nlabor, and material in order to maintain traffic to the airfield. One\r\nrunway, 2 alert areas with gravel surface and 2 with mat surface,\r\n1 matted transport parking area, 133 dispersal areas, and 24,200 feet\r\nof dispersal taxiways were constructed by 25 December.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of November all construction work was stopped on the\r\nthree airfields in the Burauen area, but not before considerable time\r\nand effort had been expended in futile attempts to make the airfields\r\nusable. [1029] Since these airfields could not be made serviceable,\r\nGeneral Krueger received permission from General MacArthur to construct\r\nan airfield in the Tanauan area, and moved his headquarters from\r\nTanauan to Tologosa on 28 November in order that construction might\r\nbe started. The new site had a good sandy surface, its drainage\r\nwas satisfactory, and it proved to be an excellent location for an\r\nairfield. By 16 December the field became operational, and by the\r\n25th there had been completed 1 runway with mat surfacing, 1 overrun,\r\n90,000 square feet of warm-up area, 120,000 square feet of alert apron,\r\n1 parallel taxiway, and 26 large dispersal areas. [1030]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoads\r\n\r\nThe rehabilitation of roads presented problems as vexatious as those\r\nin airfield construction. In southern Leyte Valley, the road that\r\nran from Dulag through Burauen to Dagami soon became impassable\r\nfor about two miles on each side of Burauen. This section of the\r\nroad was completely rebuilt by dumping approximately three feet of\r\ngravel over it. The remainder of the road was kept open most of the\r\ntime by permitting only one-way traffic. The other roads were just as\r\nbad. After heavy rains the road in the Army Service Command area was\r\nfrequently under at least two feet of water. The streets in Tacloban\r\ndisintegrated so rapidly that much engineer effort was required to\r\nkeep them open. Such maintenance was necessary to assure continued\r\noperation of the many supply and administrative facilities located\r\nin the city. [1031] The roads on the west coast were, if possible,\r\neven worse. Upkeep of the roads in general required a \"profligate\r\nexpenditure of engineer troops.\" It was found that a battalion could\r\naccomplish no more in a month than a platoon could have carried out\r\nin a week under good weather conditions. The roads required a rock or\r\ngravel foundation one to three feet thick, whereas a road-metal surface\r\nof three to four inches on an earth base was normally adequate. Since\r\npriority was given to work on the principal roads and airfields, the\r\nconstruction of access roads, as well as hardstands for hospitals,\r\ndepots, and other needed installations was greatly delayed. In this\r\nconnection General Krueger stated: \"This, in turn, greatly affected the\r\nsupply situation, including construction materials, by lack of access\r\nto the depots, lack of storage space into which to discharge ships,\r\nand lack of facilities and spare parts to permit repair and servicing\r\nof engineer heavy equipment as well as other critical transportation\r\nand combat vehicles.\" [1032]\r\n\r\nOn 21 December General Krueger estimated that after the elimination\r\nof certain projects on which informal agreements had been reached,\r\nthe extent of completion by 5 January of the other projects would be\r\nas follows: main supply roads, 50 percent; access roads, 20 percent;\r\nAir Forces installations (exclusive of air depot and assembly plants),\r\n44 percent; hospitals, 40 percent; base supply and services, 25\r\npercent; oil and aviation gasoline storage (exclusive of naval oil\r\nstorage which had not been started), 50 percent; Navy installations, 20\r\npercent; and headquarters construction, 40 percent. [1033] The gloomy\r\nprognostications of Sixth Army engineers had proven all too true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSupplies\r\n\r\nInland Movement of Supplies\r\n\r\nAs the roads on Leyte became more and more unserviceable, greater\r\nreliance was placed on the use of naval vessels to transport supplies\r\nand personnel to various parts of the island. The Transportation\r\nSection, Sixth Army, maintained a small-boat pool that was used\r\nextensively to transport light cargo and personnel between Tacloban,\r\nSan Ricardo, Palo, Tanauan, Tolosa, Dulag, and Catmon Hill. [1034]\r\nLCM's were widely employed on the northern and eastern coasts of the\r\nisland and LSM's operated on the west coast.

From about the middle of November\r\nuntil the latter part of December, 1,167,818 pounds of supplies\r\nwere either dropped or delivered by air. (Table 3) Two hundred and\r\neighty-two plane loads of supplies were dropped, a total of 2,776\r\nparachutes being used. Because of the nature of the terrain and the\r\nproximity of the Japanese, the proportion of airdropped supplies\r\nthat could be recovered varied from 65 to 90 percent. Approximately\r\n60 percent of the parachutes were recovered and returned to the 11th\r\nAir Cargo Resupply Squadron. [1036]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSupplying the West Coast\r\n\r\nThe landing of the 77th Division on the west coast of Leyte brought\r\ninto sharper focus the difficult job of giving adequate logistical\r\nsupport to the tactical units. The Sixth Army supply lines were\r\ntenuous. There was a shortage of shipping, and furnishing supplies\r\nto the troops fighting in the mountains was especially difficult.\r\n\r\nIn planning for the amphibious movement of the 77th Division,\r\nthe resupply shipping set up for the division was as follows: on 9\r\nDecember, two days after the division's landing at Deposito, 12 LSM's\r\nand 4 LCI's would bring in supplies; on 11 December, 12 LSM's and 5\r\nLCI's would bring in additional supplies; and on 13 December 12 LSM's\r\nand 4 LCI's would carry further supplies to the division. Thereafter, 3\r\nLSM's would be assigned the task of supplying the 77th Division.

[1038] Because\r\nof the extreme shortage of shipping that resulted, General Hodge\r\nsuggested to General Bruce on 8 December that thirty trucks, which\r\nhad been scheduled for delivery on the first two convoys of resupply\r\nshipping, be sent overland along the Abuyog-Baybay mountain road and\r\nused to shuttle supplies of the division between the two towns. These\r\nsupplies could be sent forward to the 77th Division when its beachhead\r\nmerged with that of the 7th Division. [1039] On the following day\r\nthe first resupply for the 77th division left Abuyog in a convoy of\r\ntrucks which went over the mountains to Baybay, where LCM's took the\r\ncargo and moved it to the area of the 77th Division. [1040]\r\n\r\nAt 2100 on 10 December, General Hodge notified General Bruce that\r\nthe second echelon of resupply was to arrive at 2359 on the following\r\nday at any beach that General Bruce desired. The supplies consisted\r\nof 40,000 rations, 1,000 gallons of 80-octane gasoline, 500 gallons\r\nof diesel oil, 100 tons of ammunition, and 10 tons of medical\r\nsupplies. Certain tactical and service units were also to be sent\r\nforward. The third echelon, which was scheduled to arrive on the west\r\ncoast on the night of 14-15 December, was to consist of the remaining\r\nunits of the 77th Division and \"considerable resupply.\" [1041]\r\n\r\nAs the tide of battle swept the 77th Division farther northward, its\r\nline of supply and that of the 7th Division became very thin. About 15\r\nDecember the supply officer of the XXIV Corps summarized the situation\r\nto the corps chief of staff. Between 19 and 25 December three resupply\r\nechelons, consisting of twenty-four LSM's and five LCI's carrying 3,250\r\ntons of supplies, were to arrive on the west coast. He believed this\r\namount was insufficient. According to his calculations, the daily\r\nrequirements for two divisions in heavy fighting were 500 tons of\r\nsupplies. He estimated that the supplies of the 77th Division could\r\nnot last beyond 18 December. By 19 December the division would be in\r\nshort supply unless 100 truck loads of supplies could be sent over\r\nthe mountains before that time. The convoy that was to go forward\r\non the 19th would carry only two days' supplies and there would be\r\na three-day interval before the arrival of the next convoy. The XXIV\r\nCorps, therefore, was faced with the problem of moving 200 truck loads\r\nof supplies during those three days merely to keep even. After 25\r\nDecember, one and a half days' supply would be sent overwater every\r\nthree days. Since the supply officer of the XXIV Corps had strong\r\ndoubts that the road would stand \"a movement involving 300 trucks\r\nevery three days\" it was believed that the supply situation would\r\nsteadily worsen. [1042]\r\n\r\nOn 15 December General Krueger sent a radio message to Admiral Kinkaid\r\nreviewing the critical supply situation and requesting that sufficient\r\namphibious shipping be made available immediately to carry supplies\r\nto the forces on the west coast. Admiral Kinkaid acquiesced, and\r\non 22 December a resupply convoy arrived at Ormoc with \"sufficient\r\nsupplies and equipment to alleviate the critical situation.\" [1043]\r\n\r\nBy 26 December a general level of five to ten days' supply of all\r\nclasses had been built up, a level that was maintained throughout\r\nthe rest of the operation. The XXIV Corps utilized to the maximum\r\nthe available space on the LSM convoys, and units on the west coast\r\nemployed all available motor transportation to supplement the tonnage\r\non the convoys. Finally, the supplies were pooled in dumps at Ipil\r\nand Ormoc and then allotted to the units.\r\n\r\nOn 25 December General Hodge received a Christmas message from his\r\nsupply officer: \"Best wishes for Merry Xmas and a New Year filled\r\nwith supplies, resupplies, more supplies and no supply worries.\" [1044]\r\n\r\nThe serious logistical situation was to affect definitely the progress\r\nof the Sixth Army as it fought its way into Ormoc Valley--the last\r\nimportant enemy stronghold on the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nThe Entrances to Ormoc Valley\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Bruce's quick exploitation of the surprise landing of the\r\n77th Division just below Ormoc had resulted in the capture of Ormoc\r\non 10 December. With each successive advance, he had displaced his\r\nentire division forward. General Bruce, as he phrased it, preferred to\r\n\"drag his tail up the beach.\" [1045]\r\n\r\nWith the seizure of Ormoc, General Krueger's Sixth Army had driven\r\nthe main elements of the Japanese 35th Army into Ormoc Valley. The\r\nJapanese were caught in the jaws of a trap--the 1st Cavalry Division\r\nand the 32d Infantry Division were closing in from the north and the\r\n77th Infantry Division from the south. General Krueger ordered the\r\nX and XXIV Corps to close this trap upon the Japanese.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSouthern Entrance to Ormoc Valley\r\n\r\nJapanese Plans\r\n\r\nWhen General Suzuki, the commander of the Japanese 35th Army, ordered\r\nthe action against the Burauen airfields, his anticipations had been\r\nhigh. Accompanied by his chief of staff and six other staff officers,\r\nhe had gone to the headquarters of the 26th Division, in the mountains\r\nnear Lubi, in order to supervise the operation personally. General\r\nTomochika, the deputy chief of staff, remained at Ormoc because of\r\nthe advance of the Americans up the west coast, and took command of\r\noperations in the area.\r\n\r\nA mixed battalion, consisting of four companies, reinforced the 12th\r\nIndependent Infantry Regiment. This regiment, under Colonel Imahori,\r\nwas to be prepared at a moment's notice for action in the Ormoc\r\nsector. [1046] The 16th and 26th Divisions received orders to retreat\r\nwestward and establish defensive positions in the Ormoc Valley. The\r\n16th Division, which had less than 200 men, had ceased to exist as a\r\nfighting unit. The Japanese decided that henceforward their operations\r\nwould be strictly defensive. The 26th Division started to withdraw\r\nthrough the mountains, but its orders to retreat were very hard to\r\ncarry out. The Americans had blocked the road, and the 11th Airborne\r\nDivision units, which had advanced west from Burauen, were attacking\r\nin the vicinity of Lubi. As a result, the staff officers of General\r\nSuzuki's 35th Army \"disbanded and scattered.\" General Suzuki passed\r\nthrough the American lines and reached the command post at Huaton,\r\nfour miles north of Ormoc, on 13 December; his chief of staff arrived\r\nthere the following day. As for the 26th Division, \"all contact with\r\nthe Division was lost by Army Headquarters until the early part of\r\nMarch.\" [1047]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime General Tomochika had prepared new plans. On 6\r\nDecember he was told by a staff officer of the 1st Division, which\r\nwas fighting the 32d Division in the north, that the 1st Division had\r\n\"reached the stage of collapse.\" [1048] The mission of the 1st Division\r\nwas then changed to one of defense. Colonel Imahori by the night of\r\n7 December had sent two companies south. [1049] These companies,\r\nknown as the Kamijo Battalion, were destroyed at Ipil by the 77th\r\nDivision in its march to Ormoc. Colonel Imahori, fearful that the\r\nrest of his detachment would suffer the same fate, ordered his main\r\nforce, the Tateishi and Maeda Battalions, to construct positions\r\nnorth of Ormoc. The remnants of the Kamijo Battalion established a\r\nposition northeast of Ormoc. In his plan for the parachute attack on\r\nthe Burauen airfields, General Suzuki had decided to use as a part\r\nof his attacking force the 4th Air Raiding Landing Unit. In view\r\nof the unfavorable situation that had developed, the 14th Area Army\r\ncommander, General Yamashita, decided that after the 4th Air Raiding\r\nLanding Unit landed at the Valencia airfield it was to be kept in\r\nthe Ormoc area. From 8 to 13 December approximately 500 men from\r\nthe unit arrived in the Ormoc area, and were attached to the Imahori\r\nDetachment. They had traveled only at dawn or dusk to avoid detection.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, \"in order to ease the difficult Leyte Island\r\nOperation,\" General Yamashita dispatched from Luzon to assist the\r\ntroops in the Ormoc sector the Takahashi Detachment, composed of the\r\n5th Infantry Regiment of the 8th Division, an artillery battalion,\r\na company of engineers, a transportation company, and a Special Naval\r\nLanding Force of 400 men with four light tanks and sixteen trench\r\nmortars. In order to suppress the guerrillas, who were active in the\r\nCamotes Islands off the west coast of Leyte and who were guarding the\r\nentrance to Ormoc Bay, the area army commander ordered a detachment,\r\nknown as the Camotes Detachment, to those islands. This detachment was\r\ncomposed of one battalion (less two companies) of the 58th Independent\r\nMixed Brigade, an artillery battery, and an engineering platoon.\r\n\r\nThe transports carrying the troops to the Ormoc area underwent a\r\nsevere aerial bombardment from American aircraft. As a consequence,\r\nonly the Special Naval Landing Force arrived at its target. On the\r\nsame day the transports carrying the Takahashi and Camotes Detachments\r\nwere forced to put in at Palompon on the west coast. The subsequent\r\nadvance of these detachments toward Ormoc was greatly delayed.\r\n\r\nOn 9 December the 77th Infantry Regiment, the last of the\r\nJapanese reinforcements for Leyte, landed at Palompon and moved to\r\nMatagob. General Suzuki intended to assemble and integrate these\r\nunits and to launch a counteroffensive against Ormoc starting on 17\r\nDecember. [1050]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCogon Defenses\r\n\r\nOn 10 December General Bruce devised a new scheme of maneuver:\r\nthe 77th Division was to break loose from its base and use Indian\r\nwarfare or blockhouse tactics. At night each \"fort\" was to establish\r\nan all-round defense from any Japanese night attacks. In the daytime,\r\nan armed convoy was to go \"from fort to fort.\" The Filipino guerrillas\r\nwere to guard the bridges and furnish intelligence. [1051]\r\n\r\nBy nightfall of 10 December the 77th Division had cleared Ormoc. (See\r\nMap 19.) The front lines of the 307th Infantry were on the western\r\noutskirts of the town along the bank of the Antilao River, a stream\r\nwhich flows past the entire western side of Ormoc. At the city's\r\nnorthern edge the river is crossed by Highway 2, which then proceeds\r\ndirectly north about 300 yards west of the river and parallel to it\r\nfor a distance of about 1,000 yards. The 306th Infantry on the right\r\nof the 307th Infantry had come abreast of that regiment at twilight.\r\n\r\nGeneral Bruce's plan for 11 December provided for a limited attack\r\nnorth to enable the division to straighten out its lines. The 305th\r\nInfantry in the afternoon would come between the 306th Infantry on the\r\nright and the 307th Infantry on the left. The 305th Infantry was to\r\nbe prepared to attack on the morning of 12 December with battalions\r\nabreast, one on each side of the highway. [1052]\r\n\r\nAt 0930 on 11 December the 306th and 307th Infantry Regiments jumped\r\noff with the 307th Infantry on the left. The assault battalions of\r\nthe 307th Infantry and the 1st Battalion, 306th Infantry, attempted to\r\ncross the Antilao River but came under heavy fire and were pinned down.\r\n\r\nThe fire came from a well-fortified position of the 12th Independent\r\nInfantry Regiment on the north bank of the river at Cogon, a small\r\nbarrio on Highway 2 just north of Ormoc. The enemy position was on\r\na small elevated plateau, adjacent to Highway 2, overlooking the\r\nriver to the south and rice paddies to the east and west. Innumerable\r\nspider holes had been constructed throughout the area. The principal\r\ndefensive position, slightly east of Cogon, was in the vicinity of a\r\nthree-story reinforced concrete building that had been converted into\r\na blockhouse. The well-camouflaged positions, with the exception of\r\nthe fortress, were so situated in the underbrush and the waist-high\r\ncogon grass that it was impossible to detect them at a distance of\r\nmore than ten feet. From these positions the Japanese could command\r\nthe bridge over the Antilao River and deny the U. S. troops the use\r\nof Highway 2 to the north. An estimated reinforced battalion with\r\nmachine guns, antitank guns, and field pieces, together with small\r\narms, defended the area.\r\n\r\nThe artillery fired on the enemy front lines, which were only\r\ntwenty-five yards in front of the American assault troops, but failed\r\nto dislodge the Japanese. The assault battalions of the 307th Infantry\r\nand the 1st Battalion, 306th Infantry, thereupon delivered point-blank\r\nfire from their tank destroyer guns, amphibian tank guns, light and\r\nmedium machine guns, and infantry weapons on the Japanese position\r\nbut still could not overcome it. The lack of shipping had prevented\r\nthe division from taking its medium tanks with it. Unable to move\r\nforward, the battalions established their front lines and perimeters\r\nfor the night along a line just north of Ormoc.\r\n\r\nOn the division's right, the 3d Battalion, 306th Infantry, moved\r\nforward against increasingly strong resistance from the 12th\r\nIndependent Infantry Regiment. After advancing about 1,000 yards the\r\n3d Battalion encountered a well-entrenched position. Elements of the\r\n12th Independent Infantry Regiment had dug in on a steep ridge in\r\nfront of which was a deep ravine. Eight hundred yards of rice paddies\r\nlay between this position and the one opposing the other battalions,\r\nthough both positions were part of the same defensive system. The\r\nartillery placed fire upon the ridge. Although able to utilize only\r\na company and a half against the enemy position, the 3d Battalion,\r\nunder cover of the artillery fire, attacked and succeeded in gaining a\r\nfoothold on the ridge. The 12th Independent Infantry Regiment at the\r\nsame time directed two unsuccessful counterattacks against the right\r\nflank and rear of the 3d Battalion. Since the forward elements on\r\nthe ridge were vulnerable and any further advance would have exposed\r\nboth flanks of the 3d Battalion, the commanding officer of the 306th\r\nInfantry at 1600 ordered the 3d Battalion to withdraw the forward\r\nunits on the enemy-held ridge and consolidate its position. [1053]\r\n\r\nAt 1600 the 2d and 3d Battalions, 305th Infantry, moved north of Ormoc\r\nand took up the position held by the 1st Battalion, 306th Infantry,\r\nbetween the 307th Infantry on the left and the 3d Battalion, 306th\r\nInfantry, on the right. The relieved battalion was ordered to take a\r\nposition to reinforce the 2d and 3d Battalions, 306th Infantry. The\r\n1st Battalion, 305th Infantry, remained just south of Camp Downes as\r\nthe extreme right flank of the 77th Division. [1054]\r\n\r\nIn his plan for the drive of the XXIV Corps up Ormoc Valley, General\r\nHodge ordered the 7th Division to \"continue the attack as directed\r\nand coordinated\" by General Bruce. [1055] To strengthen the Ormoc\r\ndefenses, elements of the 7th Division were scheduled to be brought\r\nforward. General Bruce planned to attack daily towards Valencia, which\r\nwas about six and a half miles north of Ormoc. The 77th Division would\r\neventually cut loose from the Ormoc defenses and take up each night\r\nan all-round defense. The supply convoy, protected by strong guards,\r\nwould move along Highway 2 and measure its advance by that of the\r\nassault units. The 305th Infantry was to proceed along Highway 2\r\nand the 306th Infantry, while protecting the division right flank,\r\nwas to be prepared to proceed 2,000 to 3,000 yards east of Highway 2,\r\nmove north through the hills to a point due east of Valencia, and then\r\nturn west across Highway 2 and capture that town. The 307th Infantry,\r\nwhile protecting the division left flank, was to be prepared to relieve\r\nthe 305th Infantry. The artillery of the division at the outset was\r\nto support the advance from Ormoc and eventually move with the forward\r\nelement of the 77th Division when the latter cut loose from the Ormoc\r\nsector. [1056]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnemy Night Landings\r\n\r\nAt 2330 on 11 December the 77th Division beach defense units observed\r\na Japanese convoy, which was transporting the Special Naval Landing\r\nForce, steaming into Ormoc Bay with the apparent intention of landing\r\nat Ormoc. The Japanese evidently thought that Ormoc was still in their\r\nhands. The first craft noticed by the U.S. forces was a landing barge\r\nwith about fifty men, heading directly for the Ormoc pier. By the time\r\nthe barge came within range of the shore weapons, all shore units were\r\nalert and waited with guns trained upon it. They withheld their fire\r\nuntil the barge was within fifty yards of the pier and then all weapons\r\nconverged their fires upon the craft. The first rounds squarely hit\r\nthe barge, which immediately burst into flames. The Japanese clambered\r\natop the gunwales and are reported to have screamed, \"Don't shoot,\"\r\nunder the mistaken notion that their forces still occupied Ormoc.\r\n\r\nThe harbor was lit up by the burning barge and 60-mm. illuminating\r\nshells. During the night the Americans discovered that another enemy\r\nvessel, about the size of an LST, had pulled into shore northwest of\r\nthe town under cover of darkness and was busily engaged in discharging\r\ntroops and equipment. The tank destroyer guns of the 307th Infantry,\r\nemplaced along the beach within 1,000 yards of the vessel, opened fire\r\non it while forward observers from the 902d Field Artillery Battalion\r\ndirected artillery fire upon the landing area and inland. The enemy\r\nvessel attempted to pull out to sea, but after proceeding less than\r\nfifty yards it burst into flames and sank. About 150 men, two tanks,\r\na number of rifles, mortars, and machine guns, and a quantity of\r\nammunition had been unloaded before the vessel sank, but most of the\r\nsupplies, including four ammunition trucks, had been destroyed by\r\nAmerican fire while the vessel was unloading.\r\n\r\nThe early dawn of 12 December revealed another ship of the same type\r\nfarther west near Linao. The artillery, mortars, and tank destroyer\r\nguns opened up against this vessel as it fled along the shores of\r\nOrmoc Bay, and their fire followed until it was out of range. Before\r\nthe fire ceased, heavy clouds of smoke billowed from the vessel as\r\nit moved at a snail's pace. During the night the American fire had to\r\nbe closely co-ordinated, since American vessels, including a resupply\r\nconvoy, were in the bay. Not a single U. S. craft was damaged.\r\n\r\nTroops of the Special Naval Landing Force who had disembarked got\r\nin touch with Colonel Imahori, who immediately ordered them to go\r\nto Highway 2 as the reserve unit of the 12th Independent Infantry\r\nRegiment. It was impossible for them to carry out the order, since the\r\n77th Division had advanced north from Ormoc. They thereupon decided\r\nto join a naval airfield construction unit at Valencia, but again\r\nthey failed. In the latter part of December, the men of the Special\r\nNaval Landing Force were in the eastern part of the Palompon area\r\nwithout having taken part in the battle for the Ormoc corridor. [1057]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBattle of the Blockhouse\r\n\r\nBecause the fighting on the previous day had been extremely intense,\r\nGeneral Bruce on 12 December consolidated his positions and brought\r\nforward supplies and supporting artillery. The front-line units sent\r\nout strong combat and reconnaissance patrols to the front and flanks\r\nto secure information on the dispositions of the Japanese. [1058]\r\nThroughout the day and night the artillery battalions of the division\r\nplaced harassing and interdiction fires on the enemy positions across\r\nthe Antilao River. [1059]\r\n\r\nThe 902d and 305th Field Artillery Battalions, two batteries of the\r\n304th Field Artillery Battalion, and one battery of 155-mm. howitzers\r\nfrom the 306th Field Artillery Battalion fired continuously for five\r\nminutes on the morning of 13 December at the enemy position in front\r\nof the 305th Infantry. So intense was the fire that the enemy soldiers\r\nwere bewildered and streamed toward the front lines of the division\r\nwhere they were cut down in great numbers by machine gun and small\r\narms fire. The Japanese in and around the concrete building, however,\r\nlay low and weathered the barrage.\r\n\r\nGeneral Bruce attached Col. Paul L. Freeman, an observer from the War\r\nDepartment General Staff, to the 305th Infantry. Colonel Freeman was\r\nmade the commander of a special attack force, consisting of Companies\r\nE and L, which was to storm the blockhouse. The 305th Infantry, which\r\nwas to make the main effort, had the 3d Battalion on the right of\r\nHighway 2 and the 2d and 1st Battalions on the left of the road. The\r\n3d Battalion in a column of companies moved out at 0830. In support of\r\nthe 305th Infantry, the 2d Platoon, Company A, 88th Chemical Battalion,\r\nfired on and silenced two enemy machine guns. The Japanese held their\r\nfire until the infantrymen were upon them, making it necessary for\r\nthe artillery to fire at very close range. The fire from the 305th\r\nField Artillery Battalion came to within fifty yards of the American\r\nfront lines.\r\n\r\nAfter Company I, the lead company, reached the ridge at 0925, K\r\nCompany moved up and attempted to consolidate the 3d Battalion's\r\nposition by making an oblique turn to the right flank of Company\r\nI. It was hit at 1155 by the first of five counterattacks by the 12th\r\nIndependent Infantry Regiment. The enemy preceded the infantry assault\r\nby artillery, mortar, and automatic weapons fire. The 3d Battalion\r\nestimated the enemy force to be a reinforced battalion. All of the\r\ncounterattacks were driven off with heavy casualties on both sides.\r\n\r\nThe 2d Battalion, 305th Infantry, on the left of the highway, jumped\r\noff at 0830 in a column of companies, Company F leading. At 0845 the\r\ntroops ran into concentrated automatic weapons fire, which pinned them\r\ndown. Company G moved around the left flank of Company F and also\r\ncame under heavy fire. A Japanese force estimated as two reinforced\r\ncompanies opposed Companies F and G. With the right flank of Company\r\nF on the blockhouse, the 2d Battalion pivoted on this point until\r\nthe line ran in a generally northern direction from the blockhouse\r\nand faced toward the east. The 1st Battalion faced north and tied in\r\nwith the 307th Infantry on its left. Colonel Freeman's special attack\r\nforce was unable to move forward. The 3d Battalion held the commanding\r\nground east of Highway 2. The battalions of the 305th Infantry arranged\r\nco-ordinating fires that covered all open spaces. [1060]\r\n\r\nThe 307th Infantry moved westward along the Ormoc-Linao road to\r\nforestall any enemy reinforcements and counterattacks from that\r\ndirection. The troops encountered few Japanese. The 307th Infantry\r\nin its advance of 1,000 yards took the barrio of Linao and captured\r\nthree artillery pieces and two antiaircraft guns, as well as ammunition\r\nfor those weapons. [1061]\r\n\r\nThe 306th Infantry, protecting the right flank of the 305th, received\r\nno opposition during the day but assisted the attack of the 305th\r\nInfantry by fire. Patrols of the 306th Infantry explored the area in\r\nthe vicinity of Donghol, about two miles northeast of Ormoc, but made\r\nno contact with the enemy. [1062]\r\n\r\nAlthough the 77th Division had extended its western boundary during\r\nthe day by about 1,000 yards, the front lines in the center remained\r\ngenerally where they had been in the morning. The 1st and 2d Platoons\r\nof Company A, 88th Chemical Battalion, laid a continuous smoke\r\nscreen in front of the troops from 0930 to 1630, enabling the aid\r\nmen to remove the wounded from the front lines and carry them to the\r\nrear. [1063]\r\n\r\nDuring the night of 13-14 December the artillery of the 77th Division\r\ndelivered harassing and interdiction fires to the front, the principal\r\ntarget being the concrete house that had withstood the onslaught of\r\nthe previous two days. The 1st Battalion, 305th Infantry, received\r\nenemy mortar fire during the night, and both it and the 2d Battalion\r\nreceived light machine gun fire in the early morning hours. The 2d\r\nBattalion destroyed one machine gun with mortar fire.\r\n\r\nAt 0930 on 14 December Colonel Freeman prepared his special assault\r\nforce to renew the attack. Before the jump-off, artillery and\r\nmortars laid their fire on the blockhouse and beyond. Under cover of\r\nartillery fire the troops cautiously moved out at 1030 with Company\r\nL on the right and by 1105 they had advanced 100 yards. Company L\r\nknocked out two pillboxes with flame throwers and a tank destroyer\r\ngun. Company E found every step of the way contested. The troops used\r\nhand grenades and bayonets and literally forced the enemy out of the\r\nfoxholes in tough hand-to-hand fighting. [1064] Capt. Robert B. Nett,\r\nthe commanding officer of Company E, although seriously wounded,\r\nrefused to relinquish his command. He led his company forward and\r\nkilled seven Japanese with his rifle and bayonet. Captain Nett was\r\nawarded the Medal of Honor.\r\n\r\nWhile Company E was so engaged, Company L on its right advanced\r\nthrough dense foliage and burnt the Japanese out of their foxholes\r\nand the bamboo thicket with flame throwers. The company was assisted\r\nby armored bulldozers from the 302d Engineers. For a hundred yards on\r\nall sides of the blockhouse, the enemy had dug many deep foxholes only\r\na few yards apart. All the foxholes were covered, some with coconut\r\nlogs and earth, and others with improvised lids of metal and earth. One\r\nwas protected by an upturned bathtub. The armored bulldozer drove over\r\nthe positions, its blades cutting off the tops of the foxholes, after\r\nwhich small arms fire into the holes killed the occupants. The crews of\r\nthe tank destroyers not only fired point-blank at targets but opened\r\nthe escape hatches and dropped grenades into the foxholes. [1065]\r\nAt 1240 the blockhouse, or what remained of it, was secured.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the 1st Battalion, 305th Infantry, flanked the\r\nblockhouse at 1225 and wheeled 1,000 yards to the east, cutting off\r\nthe enemy line of communications on Highway 2. The 3d Battalion,\r\n305th Infantry, remained on the high ground. By 1510 the crossroad\r\nnorth of Ormoc was taken. At the end of the day, the front lines of\r\nthe 305th Infantry ran south to north along Highway 2 with Company L\r\nin the blockhouse sector. A large pocket of the enemy, which had been\r\nbypassed by the 1st Battalion, was centered generally in front of the\r\n2d Battalion. The 307th Infantry was on the left flank of the 305th,\r\nwhile the 1st Battalion, 184th Infantry, which had relieved the 306th\r\nInfantry, was on the right flank in Ormoc. [1066]\r\n\r\nDuring the day the 307th Infantry continued its mission of protecting\r\nthe left flank of the 77th Division in its northward advance and sent\r\npatrols and a strong reconnaissance force, consisting of two reinforced\r\nrifle companies, one dismounted cannon platoon, and four tanks, west\r\nto the banks of an unnamed river near Jalubon. The reconnaissance\r\nforce killed twenty-one of the enemy, also capturing and destroying\r\ngreat quantities of Japanese matériel and supplies. By the time the\r\nperimeter of the 307th Infantry was established in the late afternoon\r\nof 14 December, as reported by General Bruce, \"the coast line from\r\nOrmoc to Jalubon was dotted with fires and the explosions of burning\r\nJapanese ammunition dumps.\" [1067]\r\n\r\nTwo other patrols, composed of volunteers from the 306th and\r\n307th Infantry Regiments, reconnoitered approximately 3,000 yards\r\nto the west of the 307th Infantry for possible trails for a wide\r\nenvelopment. [1068] These patrols met only scattered groups of the\r\nenemy and advanced within 2,000 yards of Valencia, returning with\r\nthe information that an envelopment was feasible. [1069] During the\r\nday the 184th Infantry relieved the 306th Infantry of its mission of\r\nholding the coastal defenses, freeing the latter unit for an enveloping\r\nmovement to the north.\r\n\r\nOn 15 December the 77th Division consolidated its lines and sent out\r\nsmall patrols. The enemy continued to be very active in the sector\r\nof the 305th Infantry. During the night the artillery operating in\r\nthe 1st Battalion sector knocked out four 2 1/2-ton trucks and killed\r\nseventeen of the enemy, while the 2d Battalion beat off two Japanese\r\ncounterattacks. In the 3d Battalion sector all was quiet.\r\n\r\nBy 15 December the port of Ormoc had been sealed off. It was through\r\nthis port that the Japanese had sent in a profusion of men, supplies,\r\nand equipment, thus prolonging the battle for the island beyond the\r\ntime anticipated in the original American plans for the operation. The\r\n77th Division estimated that for the period from 11 through 15 December\r\nit had taken 9 prisoners and killed 3,046 of the enemy. [1070] Its own\r\ncasualties were 2 officers and 101 enlisted men killed, 22 officers and\r\n296 enlisted men wounded, and 26 enlisted men missing in action. [1071]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mountain Passage\r\n\r\nAs a result of General Suzuki's abortive attempt to seize the Burauen\r\nairfields, a number of Japanese soldiers remained in the mountains\r\nwest of Burauen. Most of these were from the 26th Division and\r\nthey were trying to rejoin the main part of the 35th Army in Ormoc\r\nValley. Earlier, the 11th Airborne Division had started out over\r\nthe mountains from Burauen in order to relieve enemy pressure on the\r\neastern flank of the XXIV Corps in its drive toward Ormoc. (Map 21)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMahonag\r\n\r\nJust west of Burauen the central mountain range rises abruptly from\r\nLeyte Valley to peaks that are 4,000 feet or more in height. Many of\r\nthe deep, precipitous gorges were impassable even for foot soldiers. No\r\nroads went through the mountains but there were short footpaths from\r\none locality to another. Some of these trails led over boulder-strewn,\r\nswiftly running streams and frequently bridged deep gorges with a\r\nsingle log where a slip meant a drop of thirty to forty feet. The paths\r\nwere often so steep that footholds had to be cut into the hillsides,\r\nand soldiers were forced to use their hands to avoid falling as much\r\nas forty to a hundred feet. [1072]\r\n\r\nOn 25 November the 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment moved west from\r\nBurauen for Mahonag, ten miles away. The almost impassable terrain,\r\nheavy rainfall, and pockets of lurking Japanese made passage very\r\ndifficult. It was impossible for the regiment to move as a unit. In\r\nsmall parties, sometimes even less than a squad, the 511th moved\r\nforward. \"The journey to Mahonag defies description. Sucking mud,\r\njungle vines, and vertical inclines exhausted men before they had\r\nmarched an hour. Though it rained often during any one trip, still\r\nthere was no drinking water available throughout the journey.\" [1073]\r\nThe 3d Battalion, 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment, after considerable\r\nhardship entered Mahonag on 6 December. [1074]\r\n\r\nOn 9 December the 2d Battalion, though encountering heavy fire\r\nfrom enemy machine guns, mortars, and rifles, pushed steadily\r\nforward and established contact with the other units of the 511th\r\nParachute Infantry Regiment at Mahonag. For several days thereafter,\r\nthis regiment was busily engaged in sending out patrols. Company G,\r\npatrolling in force for two miles to the front, was cut off from the\r\nrest of the regiment, which was held down because of strong enemy\r\naction. On 13 December the 32d Infantry pushed northeast from Ormoc\r\nBay in an effort to make juncture with the 11th Airborne Division\r\nand assist it in moving out of the mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDrive of 32d Infantry\r\n\r\nThe 32d Infantry also encountered very precipitous hills and its\r\nadvance was bitterly contested by the Japanese. By the evening of 14\r\nDecember the regiment had considerably reduced the distance between\r\nitself and the 511th Parachute Infantry.\r\n\r\nAt 0700 on 15 December, as the 3d Battalion was moving out, a patrol\r\nof six men from Company G, 511th Parachute Infantry, entered the\r\nbattalion's lines. The rest of Company G was only 700 yards east of\r\nthe ridge. The patrol reported that Company G had been cut off from\r\nthe rest of the regiment for four days and was without food.\r\n\r\nThe 3d Battalion encountered only slight resistance and at 0950 was\r\non top of the ridge. A platoon moved out to make contact with Company\r\nG of the 511th Parachute Infantry. The platoon reached the company,\r\nand at 1855 Company G entered the lines of the 3d Battalion, which\r\nfed and sheltered its men for the night.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the 1st Battalion had moved out at 0800 and encountered\r\nscattered resistance. To the east and south of the 32d Infantry was an\r\nimpassable canyon, several hundred feet deep. In order to reach the\r\n511th Parachute Infantry, it would be necessary for the regiment to\r\ngo either north for an undetermined distance or down the ridge toward\r\nthe coast and then up again. A third possibility involved crossing\r\nthe Talisayan River in the foothills several miles to the west. With\r\nthese facts in mind Colonel Finn asked his executive officer, \"Are\r\nwe to actually contact the 511th personally[?] What is the purpose\r\nof the contact and are we to lead them out by hand[?]\" [1075]\r\n\r\nAt the same time, General Arnold advised the 511th Parachute Infantry\r\nof the situation and that \"present orders\" from General Hodge required\r\nthe displacement of the 32d Infantry from its positions in order\r\nto wipe out pockets of resistance that remained near Ormoc. The\r\n511th Parachute Infantry was to make every effort to drive toward\r\nthe position of the 32d Infantry, since the latter would soon be\r\nwithdrawn. The 511th would then have to fight it out alone. General\r\nArnold finally decided that the 1st and 3d Battalions, 32d Infantry,\r\nwould be withdrawn and that the 2d Battalion, which was fresher, would\r\nmove up and attempt to establish contact with the 511th Parachute\r\nInfantry. [1076]\r\n\r\nAt 0700 on 16 December the 2d Battalion started eastward along\r\nthe south bank of the Talisayan River. For the next few days the\r\nbattalion made slow progress, meeting and destroying small groups of\r\nthe enemy pushing west. As the troops advanced they were confronted\r\nwith steep and heavily wooded ridges which were separated by gorges\r\nseveral hundred feet deep. The Japanese, well concealed by the heavy\r\nfoliage and entrenched in caves, were most difficult to dislodge,\r\nbut the distance between the 2d Battalion and the 511th Parachute\r\nInfantry daily diminished. On 20 December the 2d Battalion was held\r\nup by the terrain and strong enemy opposition on two ridges to its\r\nfront. For the next two days the battalion pounded at the Japanese\r\nforce in attempts to dislodge it. At this time the distance between the\r\n2d Battalion and the 511th Parachute Infantry had narrowed down. Enemy\r\nresistance was overcome on the morning of 22 December. In the meantime\r\nthe 187th Glider Infantry Regiment passed through the 511th Parachute\r\nInfantry Regiment and continued the attack. At 1330 on 22 December the\r\n2d Battalion of the 187th Glider Infantry Regiment passed through the\r\n2d Battalion, 32d Infantry, and pushed on to the coast. The difficult\r\nmountain passes had been overcome. [1077]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Drive South\r\n\r\nRegrouping of Japanese Forces\r\n\r\nWhen the Americans took Limon, the key point of entrance on Highway\r\n2 into Ormoc Valley from the north, the Japanese forces were thrown\r\ninto confusion. The Americans, unknown to themselves, had successfully\r\ndivided the Japanese 1st and 102d Divisions that had been charged\r\nwith the defense of northern Leyte. The Japanese were forced to\r\nregroup their various units in an attempt to correct the rapidly\r\ndeteriorating situation along their front lines. The strong American\r\ninfantry assaults, which had been co-ordinated with heavy mortar and\r\nartillery fire, induced General Kataoka, the commanding general of\r\nthe 1st Division, to redistribute his forces along Highway 2. [1078]\r\n\r\nThe onslaught of the X Corps had forced General Suzuki to abandon\r\nthe earlier plan of advancing the 35th Army north along three widely\r\nseparated routes. Instead he had to concentrate the main strength of\r\nthe 1st Division along the highway to check the American advance. The\r\nplan to use the 1st Division as a strong offensive force had to be\r\ndiscarded in favor of using it in a strictly defensive role.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Division had suffered much: as of 2 December, 3,000 of\r\nits men had been killed or wounded. Furthermore, one third of the\r\ninfantry weapons of the 1st Infantry Regiment and two thirds of\r\nthose belonging to the 57th Infantry Regiment had been rendered\r\ninoperable. The infantry was short of grenades and ammunition for\r\nthe 50-mm. grenade dischargers. \"The men were suffering from the\r\neffect of continuous fighting, from lack of provisions, overwork,\r\nand especially from the lack of vitamins.\" [1079]\r\n\r\nBy this time communications between the 1st Division and other units\r\nhad broken down. Telephonic and telegraphic communications between\r\nthe division and 35th Army headquarters were out for long periods of\r\ntime, and liaison between the division headquarters and front-line\r\nunits was carried out by messengers moving on foot. The supply lines\r\nhad also broken down. The 1st Division Transport Regiment found it\r\nvirtually impossible to supply food and ammunition to the 1st and\r\n57th Infantry Regiments and the 1st Artillery Regiment.\r\n\r\nGeneral Kataoka grouped his forces along Highway 2 in the\r\nLimon-Pinamopoan area in order to concentrate the maximum strength\r\nalong Highway 2. The 1st Reconnaissance Regiment was to attack the\r\nleft flank of the 32d Division, [1080] which was already opposed by\r\nthe 57th Infantry in the Limon sector; the 1st Battalion, less Company\r\n3 and the 2d Battalion, plus Company 11, of the 49th Infantry were to\r\noccupy the 1,900-yard sector two miles southeast of Limon in order to\r\nhold back American forces in that area; and the 1st Artillery Regiment\r\nwas to defend its prepared positions south of Limon. The troops of\r\nthe 1st Engineer Regiment and other noncombat units were issued small\r\narms and ordered to take part in the defense of Highway 2. [1081]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDrive of the 32d Division\r\n\r\nIn order to support the amphibious landing of the 77th Division at\r\nDeposito and its subsequent movement northward, General Krueger had\r\nordered the X Corps to make its main effort, beginning on 5 December,\r\nby advancing vigorously south astride Highway 2 from the vicinity\r\nof Limon. [1082] Acting on Corps orders, General Gill prepared to\r\nmove out with two regiments abreast. The 32d Division consolidated\r\nits positions on 5 December, and readied itself for a strong assault\r\nsouth down Highway 2. [1083] (See Map 14.)\r\n\r\nThe 127th Infantry had pushed past the 3d Battalion, 128th Infantry,\r\nwhich was south of the Leyte River and west of Limon. The 127th\r\nencountered very determined resistance from the Japanese entrenched\r\non the high ground 1,000 yards south of the Leyte River bridge. The\r\nwell-camouflaged enemy defenses consisted of numerous foxholes and\r\nten-foot-deep spider holes, many of which were connected by interlacing\r\ncommunication trenches.\r\n\r\nThe terrain that the troops traversed was adapted to defensive\r\nfighting, and the 1st Division took full advantage of this fact. There\r\nwere deep ravines and steep hills where the enemy had dug in on both\r\nthe forward and reverse slopes. The entire area was covered by heavy\r\nrain forest with dense underbrush. The nearly constant rainfall made\r\nobservation difficult and the maps for the area were very inaccurate.\r\n\r\nBy 12 December the 32d Division had \"detoured\" around the 1st and\r\n57th Infantry Regiments of the 1st Division and was assaulting\r\nthe Japanese artillery positions south of Limon. On this date the\r\ndivision straightened out its lines, established physical contact\r\nbetween the assault battalions, resupplied the assault units,\r\nand sent out patrols. The sector in which the greatest Japanese\r\nresistance was encountered continued to be that of the 2d Battalion,\r\n126th Infantry. Employing mortars and four tanks, this battalion was\r\nable to make only limited gains. [1084]\r\n\r\nDuring the night of 12-13 December the artillery battalions of the\r\n32d Division fired harassing missions near the perimeters of the\r\n126th and 127th Infantry Regiments and southward on Highway 2 as far\r\nas the vicinity of Lonoy.\r\n\r\nThe 14th Area Army had planned to land the 39th Infantry Regiment\r\nand an artillery company from the 10th Division near Carigara on\r\n16 December, but in view of the American 77th Division's advance to\r\nOrmoc the plan was canceled on 11 December. On 13 December General\r\nSuzuki attached an infantry company of about 100 men from the 102d\r\nDivision to the 1st Division in order to strengthen the latter's lines.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of 13 December the 2d Battalion, 126th Infantry, with\r\nthe assistance of its tanks and heavy mortars, pushed past the Japanese\r\nwho had held up its advance. In the face of most determined opposition\r\nthe battalion moved south, destroying the pockets of resistance which\r\nhad been bypassed. At the end of the day the 2d Battalion had advanced\r\n400 yards to a position 200 yards north of a roadblock set up by\r\nthe 3d Battalion, 126th Infantry. The 3d Battalion, less Company L,\r\nwhich was to remain on the high ground overlooking the road, was to\r\nattack south on the east side of Highway 2 and come abreast of the\r\n1st Battalion, 126th Infantry.\r\n\r\nAt 1521 the 3d Battalion reported that six enemy tanks were coming\r\nup the highway. After heavy fighting, the Japanese tanks withdrew at\r\nnightfall and returned to the south. The 1st Battalion, 126th Infantry,\r\nthe southernmost unit of the division, made plans to dislodge the\r\nenemy force between it and the 3d Battalion. The contested ground\r\nconsisted of an open space 600 to 700 yards long and 200 to 300 yards\r\nwide, at the southern end of which were two knolls. The 1st Battalion\r\nhad men on both knolls but did not control the northern end of the\r\nsector where the Japanese had dug in and were using machine guns,\r\nmortars, and rifles. The 1st Battalion charged against the Japanese\r\nand rooted them out with grenades and mortar fire. Except for this\r\naction, only slight gains were registered during the day. The men\r\nof the battalion were hungry, having been without food since the\r\nprevious afternoon. The commanding officer of the battalion renewed\r\na request for additional rations and ammunition, since the one-third\r\nration that had been received the day before was insufficient.\r\n\r\nThe 1st and 2d Battalions of the 127th Infantry received orders from\r\nthe regimental commander to advance south with the 1st Battalion on\r\nthe left, pinch out the 3d Battalion, 126th Infantry, and link up with\r\nthe 1st Battalion, 126th Infantry. The 1st Battalion, 127th Infantry,\r\nmoved out in a column of companies and had advanced 400 yards when it\r\nencountered forty to fifty Japanese on a ridge to its front, about 150\r\nyards west of the road. The enemy threw blocks of TNT and grenades\r\nagainst the battalion, effectively pinning down the troops. A night\r\nperimeter was established.\r\n\r\nThe 2d Battalion, 126th Infantry, moved abreast of the regiment's 1st\r\nBattalion throughout the day. Its advance was bitterly contested by\r\nthe Japanese, who employed machine guns, mortars, and rifles against\r\nthe battalion, which dug in for the night under fire. [1085] At 1630\r\nthe 11th Field Artillery Battalion fired upon fifteen Japanese who were\r\nwalking along the road south of Lonoy and killed twelve of them. [1086]\r\n\r\nThe night of 13-14 December was not quiet. At 2300 an enemy force\r\nfrom the 1st Infantry Regiment broke into the command post of the\r\n126th Infantry. The Japanese set up a machine gun in the area and\r\nattacked with grenades and rifles. Bitter hand-to-hand fighting ensued\r\nbut by 0325 the enemy force was evicted and the area had quieted\r\ndown. At 0630, with the coming of dawn, the Headquarters Company got\r\nthings in order and everyone was \"happy to hear sound of comrade's\r\nvoices.\" Six Japanese were killed and two Americans and two Filipinos\r\nwounded. [1087]\r\n\r\nOn 14 December nearly all battalions of the 127th and 126th Infantry\r\nRegiments were engaged in moving slowly forward and maintaining\r\nphysical contact with each other. At 1045 the air observer of\r\nthe 11th Field Artillery Battalion located what appeared to be a\r\ncamouflaged four-gun position at a point 300 yards northeast of\r\nLonoy. The battalion fired upon the site and the Japanese fled from\r\nthe position. The 11th Field Artillery Battalion again fired into\r\nthe same general area at 1315 and set a supply and ammunition dump\r\nand three buildings on fire. At 1530 the battalion and the corps\r\nartillery massed their fires in order to cover all of Lonoy. [1088]\r\nAt 1730, the 127th Infantry destroyed two enemy tanks going north.\r\n\r\nThe 126th Infantry, on the same day, moved forward in a column of\r\nbattalions. The 1st Battalion made a limited advance, since it was\r\nvery short of ammunition and completely out of food. It did establish\r\na roadblock, however, and made contact with the 2d Battalion, 127th\r\nInfantry. The 2d Battalion, the northernmost unit of the 126th\r\nInfantry, moved slowly behind the 3d Battalion of the regiment. An\r\ninterval of about 250 yards existed between the two battalions. The\r\nJapanese in front of the 32d Division, especially in the sector of\r\nthe 3d Battalion, had strongly entrenched themselves and resisted\r\nthe 3d Battalion from both sides of the highway.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Every bend of the road was lined with ... foxholes dug into the\r\n    banks of the road and spider holes dug underneath the roots of\r\n    trees and under logs on the hillsides. It was bitter, close hand\r\n    to hand fighting and because of the steepness of the terrain,\r\n    the denseness of the tree growth, the inaccuracy of maps and\r\n    nearness of adjoining units, artillery and mortar fire could not\r\n    be used to its full advantage in reducing these positions. [1089]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main Japanese defensive line had been reached. By 14 December the\r\n32d Division had advanced more than two miles south of Limon. The\r\n77th Division had crushed the Cogon defenses and was in a position\r\nto drive north and make juncture with elements of the X Corps. The\r\nnorthern and southern entrances to Ormoc Valley were denied to the\r\nJapanese. The jaws of the Sixth Army trap were starting to close.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nSeizure of Ormoc Valley\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Krueger wished the two corps to attack aggressively through\r\nOrmoc Valley toward Valencia, about six and a half miles north of\r\nOrmoc. The X Corps, pushing south along Highway 2, was to seize the\r\nhigh ground north of Valencia and the XXIV Corps was to continue\r\nits drive north, capture Valencia, and establish contact with the X\r\nCorps. (Map 22) Driving north along Highway 2, the 77th Division was\r\nto seize Valencia and its airfield and effect a juncture with the X\r\nCorps to separate the enemy forces in the mountains east of its zone\r\nof action from those on the west coast in the Palompon area. General\r\nBruce was to co-ordinate all artillery fires and air support missions\r\nin the Ormoc-Valencia area. [1090]\r\n\r\nAfter the seizure of Ormoc, although the 35th Army still controlled\r\nOrmoc Valley, the Sixth Army had closed the northern and southern\r\nentrances. There remained available to the Japanese as a principal\r\nport only Palompon. A road from this town through the mountains joined\r\nHighway 2 in the vicinity of Libongao and constituted the only main\r\nroute from the west coast of Leyte to Ormoc Valley. The Americans\r\nnoticed that the Japanese were moving supplies, men, ammunition,\r\nand artillery to the Valencia area and concluded that the Japanese\r\nwould make a defensive stand in Valencia. [1091]\r\n\r\nBy the end of 15 December the forces of General Bruce had cleared\r\nthe Japanese defenders from the Ormoc area and were ready for the\r\nnext phase of the drive north up the Ormoc corridor. Reports made the\r\nprevious day by the reconnaissance patrols from the 306th and 307th\r\nInfantry Regiments indicated that there was little enemy resistance\r\nto the west of Highway 2. These led General Bruce to decide in favor\r\nof a plan for enveloping the enemy from the west. The 306th and 307th\r\nInfantry were to strike the flanks and rear of the Japanese defending\r\nthe highway and thus permit a more rapid advance along this road by\r\nthe 305th Infantry. [1092]\r\n\r\nGeneral Hodge had informed General Bruce that the commanding general\r\nof the Sixth Army desired to have the attack pushed \"with all possible\r\nvigor.\" The operations of the 77th Division were to depend upon the\r\nsituation and conditions then existing. [1093] On 14 December General\r\nHodge visited General Bruce, who explained his plans. General Hodge\r\nthought they were \"sound\" [1094] and later told General Bruce to keep\r\nhis plans flexible in order to take advantage of every break to speed\r\nthe advance north. It was imperative that the XXIV Corps secure control\r\nof the roads north before the Japanese could establish positions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDrive From the South to the Libongao Area\r\n\r\nSeizure of the Road Junction\r\n\r\nAccording to its plan of attack for 16 December the 305th Infantry,\r\nfrom the vicinity of Cogon, was to continue its assault north\r\non Highway 2, liquidate the remaining enemy forces in Cogon, and\r\nfinally secure a large defensive position centered around the road\r\njunction north of Cogon. All three battalions of the regiment were\r\nto consolidate around the point while the 306th and 307th Infantry\r\nRegiments were to drive toward Valencia.\r\n\r\nThe Cannon and Antitank Companies and the heavy weapons units of the\r\nother two regiments were attached to the 305th Infantry for movement\r\nonly and were to be used solely in case of emergency. These units\r\nwere to be sent to the 306th and 307th Infantry Regiments upon call\r\nby those regiments.\r\n\r\nAt 0930 on 16 December the assault units of the 305th Infantry moved\r\nout. The 1st Battalion, on the left of Highway 2, was to attack north,\r\nand the 3d Battalion, on the right of Highway 2, was to attack north\r\nand then northeast to effect a juncture with the 1st and 2d Battalions\r\nat the road junction north of Cogon. The 2d Battalion was to attack\r\neast to flank the enemy positions along the highway. The operation\r\nwas to be assisted by artillery.\r\n\r\nDuring the morning the artillery in support of the 1st Battalion\r\nknocked out two antitank guns, a heavy machine gun, and an enemy\r\ndugout position. At 1035 the 1st Battalion had advanced several\r\nhundred yards. As the 3d Battalion came forward, Company L moved in\r\non the right flank of the 1st Battalion. At 1100 the 2d Battalion\r\nhad reached the enemy positions along the highway and by 1215 had\r\ncleared out the enemy pocket and the road in its sector. A light\r\ntank platoon from the 706th Tank Battalion was attached to the 1st\r\nBattalion at 1255 in order to assist the battalion in clearing the\r\nJapanese from their foxholes. Although progress was slow, it was\r\nthorough. The localized envelopments of the enemy's right (west)\r\nflank resulted in the capture of Cogon at the end of the day. The\r\n305th Infantry advanced 400 yards north of the road junction and\r\nestablished night positions around it. [1095]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnvelopment of Valencia\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the 306th and 307th Infantry Regiments had been\r\nordered to make a series of sweeping envelopments on the Japanese right\r\n(west) flank toward Valencia. The 307th Infantry was to move northwest\r\nabout six and a quarter miles through the barrios of Jalubon, Liloan,\r\nand Bao to Catayom on the Bao River, then swing northeast to the barrio\r\nof San Jose and continue northeast to the Valencia airstrip. The\r\n306th Infantry was to follow the 307th Infantry northwest and then\r\ndrive east and cut Highway 2. [1096]\r\n\r\nThe 306th Field Artillery Battalion, though in general support, was to\r\ngive priority to the 307th Infantry. The 902d and 305th Field Artillery\r\nBattalions were to support elements of the reconnaissance troops\r\noperating on each flank of the division. The artillery battalions\r\nwould fire in the regimental zones of action only on call from or\r\nwith the approval of the regiments. [1097]\r\n\r\nOn 16 December the 307th Infantry crossed the line of departure\r\non time. Since there were no roads and the route was across rice\r\npaddies, through waist-deep rivers, and over terrain impassable\r\nfor vehicles, the troops hand-carried their supplies. Arrangements\r\nwere also made for Filipinos to carry supplies, and, as the advance\r\nprogressed, more and more Filipinos joined the column of the 307th\r\nInfantry for this purpose. [1098] The regiment met only scattered\r\nresistance. Some Japanese troops encountered in the vicinity of Liloan\r\nwere dispersed. At 1525 leading elements of the 307th Infantry passed\r\nthrough Bao and moved on toward San Jose. On the outskirts of that\r\nbarrio, the troops met and destroyed two platoons of the enemy. At\r\n1645 the 307th Infantry dug in for the night in San Jose. The regiment\r\nhad covered eight miles, a rapid rate of advance considering the\r\nnature of the terrain and the load carried. At 2340 General Bruce\r\ntold the 307th Infantry that an incendiary air strike would be made\r\non Valencia before 0900 the following day and that the regiment was\r\nto hold its present position until further orders. [1099]\r\n\r\nAt 0900 on 16 December the 306th Infantry moved past the initial point\r\nof departure on the northwestern edge of Ormoc. At 1035 the regiment\r\nwas 1,000 yards west of the starting point and close \"on the tail\"\r\nof the 307th Infantry. The 306th waited until the 307th cleared and\r\nthen moved north. Although it did not encounter any Japanese its\r\nprogress was very slow because the route of advance ran through deep\r\nrice paddies. At 1730 the regiment established its night perimeter\r\nabout 700 yards south-southwest of Tipic. [1100] During the day the\r\n305th Infantry had cleared Cogon and occupied defensive positions\r\naround the road junction north of the town.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese had constructed defensive positions along Highway 2 in\r\nthe southern part of Ormoc Valley. At the road junction of Highway 2\r\nwith the road to Liloan were many trenches three to four feet deep and\r\nparallel to the highway. Trenches had also been dug along the sides of\r\na machine gun emplacement that occupied a slight elevation commanding\r\nHighway 2 both to the north and to the south. On both sides of the\r\nroad from Cogon to Catayom foxholes lined Highway 2, in the ditches\r\nand under the shacks. Some of these positions were dug on a slant and\r\nwere six to seven feet deep. At Tambuco the foxholes extended along\r\nthe highway for 400 yards, with machine gun emplacements on the sides\r\nof the foxholes. Other positions along Highway 2 consisted of poorly\r\nintegrated foxholes and machine guns that covered the road. The field\r\nartillery pieces between Tambuco and Catayom were placed along the\r\nhighway, with the exception of a 75-mm. gun that guarded a bridge\r\nand was well concealed inside a roadside shack. [1101]\r\n\r\nThe 14th Area Army had planned to reinforce the 35th Army by\r\ndispatching the Takahashi Detachment, which consisted of the 5th\r\nInfantry Regiment, one artillery battalion, and one engineer company\r\nand one transport company each from the 8th Division, together with\r\nthe Ito Naval Landing Force of 400 troops from Luzon.\r\n\r\nThe 77th Infantry Regiment had landed at Palompon on or about 9\r\nDecember from Cebu and moved to Matagob where, after assembling its\r\ntroops, it began to move southeast toward Huaton, the new headquarters\r\nof the 35th Army. Huaton was a small barrio on Highway 2 about three\r\nand a half miles north of Cogon. On 13 December General Suzuki,\r\nthe commander of the 35th Army, arrived at Huaton from the Burauen\r\narea. After the 12th Independent Infantry Regiment, the 4th Airborne\r\nRaiding Regiment, the Mitsui Shipping Unit, the Ito Naval Landing\r\nForce, and the 77th Infantry Regiment were assembled, General Suzuki\r\non 15 December ordered an attack, which was to start 17 December,\r\nagainst the American forces in the Ormoc area. [1102]\r\n\r\nThe fall of Cogon and the envelopment to the west forced General\r\nSuzuki to change his plans again. The 305th Infantry had captured the\r\npositions of the Tateishi Battalion of the 12th Independent Infantry\r\nRegiment, and the position of the 77th Infantry Regiment was greatly\r\nweakened. As the attack against Ormoc could not be successfully\r\ncompleted, the 12th and 77th Infantry Regiments were to carry out a\r\ndelaying action. [1103]\r\n\r\nSince the fall of Valencia might break the organized resistance of the\r\nJapanese in Ormoc Valley, General Bruce decided to push forward rapidly\r\nand take the barrio before the enemy could regroup. [1104] General\r\nKrueger asked General Whitehead for air strikes against Valencia. If\r\nthe weather permitted, a strike would be made at 0900 and another would\r\nbe delivered on call. In addition, nearly all available artillery of\r\nthe division that could arrive within firing distance, as well as the\r\n226th Field Artillery Battalion from positions east of the mountains\r\nnear Daro, would shell the town until ordered to lift the fire.\r\n\r\nThe 305th Infantry was to drive rapidly north on Highway 2 and clear\r\nout the Japanese for a distance of 200 to 300 yards on each side of the\r\nroad, even though it might mean bypassing groups of the enemy on the\r\nflanks. A patrol from the regiment was to operate east of its sector\r\nto locate enemy forces. The 306th Infantry was to drive rapidly east\r\ntoward Highway 2 and then advance north up the highway, clearing a lane\r\n200 to 300 yards wide. At a point 500 to 600 yards north of Cabulihan,\r\nit was to await further orders. The regiment was to be prepared to\r\nsend a battalion south to assist the 305th Infantry in its advance.\r\n\r\nGeneral Bruce organized an armored column to carry rations and\r\nammunition to the 306th and 307th Infantry Regiments. This column,\r\nwhich was to move north on Highway 2, consisted of five light tanks\r\nfrom the 7th Division, the Cannon and Tank Destroyer Companies of the\r\n306th and 307th Infantry Regiments, part of Company C, 302d Engineer\r\nBattalion, a platoon from the 305th Infantry, and sufficient LVT's to\r\ncarry men and supplies. An artillery observer accompanied the column.\r\n\r\nElements of the 302d Engineer Battalion were to repair immediately\r\nthe highway between Ormoc and Valencia and at night retire within\r\nthe nearest infantry defensive perimeter. The order was summed up as\r\nfollows: \"The action will be pressed with the utmost vigor by careful\r\nplanning but every effort will be made to save casualties.\" [1105]\r\n\r\nAt 0830 on 17 December the 305th Infantry moved out along Highway 2. At\r\n1000 the 1st Battalion reported that it was advancing at the rate of\r\n100 yards every ten minutes against light opposition. By 1145 the 305th\r\nInfantry was fighting through Tambuco. At a road junction just north\r\nof Tambuco, it eliminated some enemy resistance and the advance slowed\r\ndown. The regiment moved forward to a point about 300 yards north of\r\nthe road junction and established its night perimeter, which extended\r\n300 yards to the northeast along the Tambuco-Dolores road in order\r\nto forestall any Japanese counterattacks from that direction. [1106]\r\n\r\nOn the same day the 306th Infantry pushed its attack northeast at\r\n0800. The advancing troops almost immediately encountered Japanese\r\nwho, apparently taken by surprise, were unable to offer organized\r\nresistance. At 1040, when the forward elements were 1,000 yards\r\nsouthwest of Cabulihan, the opposition stiffened and the regimental\r\ncommander therefore committed the 3d Battalion on the left of the 2d\r\nBattalion. The advance continued. As the regiment neared Highway 2,\r\nresistance became more intense. The 306th Infantry encountered the\r\nJapanese who were fleeing northwest from the assault of the 305th\r\nInfantry and the heavy artillery that accompanied it. (Unknown\r\nto the Americans, General Suzuki and his staff were among the\r\nretreating Japanese. Suzuki succeeded in escaping to Libongao, where\r\nhe established a new headquarters for the 35th Army.) At 1440 the 306th\r\nInfantry reached Highway 2 between Catayom and Cabulihan and proceeded\r\nnorth toward Cabulihan, its objective. Advance elements of the 3d\r\nBattalion reached the outskirts of the town but withdrew three or\r\nfour hundred yards to take advantage of more commanding terrain. After\r\ncombat patrols had cleared the area, the 306th Infantry established its\r\nnight perimeter five hundred yards south of Cabulihan at 1600. [1107]\r\n\r\nGeneral Bruce had ordered the 307th Infantry to remain in San Jose\r\nuntil further notice. Since the guerrilla forces had reported a large\r\nnumber of Japanese in the area, General Bruce had made arrangements\r\nto soften the sector with an aerial bombardment and artillery fire\r\nbefore the infantry attack. In response to Bruce's request, fifteen\r\nP-40's from the V Fighter Command had been made available by General\r\nWhitehead for an air strike against the Valencia area.\r\n\r\nThe 155-mm. guns of the 226th Field Artillery Battalion at Daro began\r\nfiring on Valencia and the airstrip on the morning of 17 December\r\nand hit a Japanese ammunition dump. At 1245 the artillery fire\r\nwas halted for the air strike, and for fifty minutes the area was\r\nbombed and strafed. With the conclusion of the air attack, at 1335,\r\nthe artillery began anew to pound the area. \"The medium artillery\r\n... reached out from Ormoc and the 'Long Toms' ... from Daro joined\r\nin the fighting.\" [1108] In the meantime the 902d Field Artillery\r\nBattalion moved forward to a point from which it could support the\r\nadvance of the 307th Infantry. At 1415 the artillery fire stopped\r\nand the 307th Infantry moved out astride the San Jose-Valencia road\r\ntoward Valencia. Though the artillery fire and aerial bombardment had\r\ndriven some of the Japanese from the area, a strong well-equipped\r\nforce, including a number of paratroopers, remained to oppose the\r\n307th Infantry. The regiment pushed forward, however, and at 1640\r\nits leading elements were on the southwestern edge of the airstrip\r\nand within 1,000 yards of Valencia. The 307th Infantry formed its\r\nnight perimeter on the edge of the airfield and made preparations to\r\ncontinue the attack on 18 December. [1109]\r\n\r\nDuring 17 December, despite the disorganization of the Japanese forces,\r\nColonel Imahori of the 12th Independent Infantry Regiment tried to\r\nreach Ormoc, but he was unsuccessful. [1110] A few enemy artillery\r\nshells landed in the Ormoc area but that was all. General Bruce wrote\r\nlater: \"The men got a laugh because the General's latrine, unoccupied,\r\nwas struck. He wished about that time that he had remained up front\r\nwhich he had reached by landing in a cub plane on an unimproved jungle\r\nroad.\" [1111]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of 18 December, since supplies and ammunition for the\r\n306th and 307th Infantry Regiments were becoming dangerously low,\r\nGeneral Bruce pushed the armored column vigorously forward through\r\nthe 305th Infantry. The column swept past enemy strong points and\r\nsucceeded in bringing supplies to both regiments.\r\n\r\nThe attack of the 305th Infantry was consequently delayed. The 3d\r\nBattalion of the regiment, however, jumped off in a northeast direction\r\non the Dolores road in order to cut off any Japanese reinforcements\r\nfrom that area. At 0945 the rest of the 305th Infantry started\r\nout along Highway 2 and encountered little resistance. By 1400 the\r\nbattalions had passed through the barrios of Dayhagan and Huaton (the\r\nformer and short-lived headquarters of General Suzuki), and knocked\r\nout fifteen enemy trucks and three tanks. The 3d Battalion proceeded\r\nnortheast from the road junction along the road to Dolores, and crushed\r\nall resistance. The battalion then moved west toward Highway 2, leaving\r\na platoon behind to seal off the Dolores road from Highway 2. [1112]\r\n\r\nAt 0830 on 18 December the 306th Infantry renewed its attack. At first\r\nthe 2d Battalion moved south astride Highway 2 in order to make contact\r\nwith the 305th Infantry, which was pushing north along the highway,\r\nbut since there was little resistance the battalion withdrew and\r\nrejoined the regiment. As the rest of the regiment continued north\r\nit met moderate opposition but pushed ahead steadily. The troops\r\nencountered many strong points along the road but no organized main\r\nline of resistance.\r\n\r\nThe 306th Infantry proceeded astride the highway against moderate to\r\nstrong opposition. An enemy force estimated as two battalions had dug\r\nin under the houses and in foxholes along the sides of the road. The\r\nJapanese tried to halt the advance with heavy machine guns and a\r\nfew mortars, but without avail. Patrols from the 306th Infantry made\r\ncontact with the 305th Infantry at 1500. The 306th Infantry reached\r\nthe southern edge of Valencia at 1630 and tied in with the 307th\r\nInfantry. Night perimeters were established. [1113]\r\n\r\nAt 0830 on 18 December the 307th Infantry from the southwestern edge\r\nof the Valencia airstrip renewed the attack. There was no opposition\r\nand at 0905 the airfield and the town of Valencia were in the hands\r\nof the regiment. General Bruce considered the heavy artillery and\r\naerial assaults of the previous day \"most effective.\" The airfield\r\nwas in \"fair\" condition; it was safe for light aircraft and with\r\nminor repairs could be made suitable for other aircraft. The 307th\r\nInfantry spent the rest of 18 December consolidating its positions\r\nand conducting extensive patrols to the north and east. At 1630 it\r\nestablished physical contact with the 306th Infantry. [1114]\r\n\r\nIn three days of relatively fast fighting and maneuvering the 77th\r\nDivision had shaken the Japanese forces badly and disrupted the plans\r\nof General Suzuki. The 307th Infantry, by making a wide envelopment\r\nof the west flank, had captured Valencia and its airfield, and the\r\n306th Infantry, making a smaller envelopment, had bisected Highway\r\n2 at Cabulihan while the 305th Infantry moved up the highway from\r\nCogon. All of southern Ormoc Valley from Ormoc to Valencia, a distance\r\nof about six and a half miles as the crow flies, was securely in\r\nAmerican hands. All units were in contact and ready for the next\r\nphase of their mission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDrive to Palompon Road Junction\r\n\r\nSince elements of the XXIV Corps had been able to make more rapid\r\nprogress through Ormoc Valley than the X Corps units, General Krueger\r\non 19 December enlarged the zone of action of the XXIV Corps to\r\ninclude Libongao, the barrio just below the juncture of Highway 2\r\nwith the Palompon road. [1115] General Hodge thereupon ordered the\r\n77th Division to continue north and seize Libongao and then to secure\r\nthe Palompon road and establish contact with the X Corps. [1116]\r\n\r\nGeneral Bruce ordered the 305th Infantry to assume responsibility for\r\nthe defense of Valencia and its airfield, and thus free the 306th\r\nand 307th Infantry Regiments for new assignments. The 307th was to\r\nmove north astride Highway 2 to Libongao and then continue to the\r\njunction with the Palompon road. The 306th was to move across country\r\nand strike northwest toward the Palompon road. Although its advance\r\nwould parallel that of the 307th, the 306th was to be about 2,300\r\nyards west of the other regiment. After reaching the Palompon road\r\nin the vicinity of the Togbong River the 306th Infantry would strike\r\nwest for the crossing and then move east to the road junction. The\r\n304th, 305th, and 902d Field Artillery Battalions were to remain in\r\nthe Valencia area while the 306th Field Artillery Battalion was to\r\nbe prepared to move forward on call. [1117]\r\n\r\nAt Libongao, General Suzuki prepared his defense. In the area he had\r\nhis headquarters guard and a part of the 4th Airborne Raiding Regiment,\r\nin addition to a field artillery battalion, an engineering company,\r\nand a transportation company. An advance battalion of the Takahashi\r\nDetachment arrived in the sector from Palompon on the night of 17\r\nDecember. General Suzuki ordered it to proceed south from Libongao\r\nand destroy the American forces in the Valencia area. [1118]\r\n\r\nAs the 307th Infantry advanced north at 0900 on 19 December, it\r\nbecame apparent that General Suzuki had organized a defense of the\r\nhighway. Many machine gun and light artillery emplacements were dug\r\nin along the road, and the enemy resistance became more determined\r\nas the troops moved north. A force estimated to be of battalion\r\nstrength was dug in in depth along streams and ridges. With the use\r\nof grenades the 307th routed the defenders, the battalion from the\r\nTakahashi Detachment. The 307th Infantry pushed steadily north and\r\nat 1800 established a night perimeter; it had advanced nearly three\r\nmiles and captured much enemy equipment during the day. [1119]\r\n\r\nThe 306th Infantry moved out at 1100 and proceeded rapidly, without\r\nmeeting resistance, to a point about 500 yards south of the Palompon\r\nroad where it encountered elements of the 5th Infantry Regiment. At\r\n1530 a battery of artillery and infantry mortars and machine guns\r\nfired upon the Japanese. In co-ordination with fire from these\r\nweapons, the 306th Infantry was then able to push forward. At 1800,\r\nthough patrols from the regiment had reached the Palompon road, the\r\nregiment itself dug in for the night at a point 300 yards south of\r\nthe Palompon road. [1120]\r\n\r\nOn 20 December, after a five-minute artillery preparation to its\r\nfront, the 307th Infantry moved out at 0830 and encountered the\r\n\"strongest fortified positions\" since it had left Camp Downes. The\r\nJapanese 5th Infantry Regiment and other elements of the 1st Division\r\nresisted any forward advance. By 1000 the 307th Infantry had \"mowed\r\ndown\" and annihilated two suicide counterattacks of fifty men each\r\non its right flank. An additional force, estimated at 2,000 men,\r\nwell equipped with machine guns, mortars, and a limited amount\r\nof artillery, opposed the 307th Infantry from hastily constructed\r\ndefensive positions. The attack of the enemy forces was not well\r\nco-ordinated; consequently the regiment, though slowed down, was\r\nable to continue forward. At 1549 the leading elements of the 307th\r\nInfantry were at Libongao. The enemy defensive fire increased in\r\nintensity on the northern outskirts of the village. At 1710, about\r\n200 yards north of Libongao, the regiment repulsed a force estimated\r\nto consist of 200 Japanese armed with machine guns and mortars. The\r\n307th Infantry established its night perimeter about 1,000 yards south\r\nof the road junction. During the day the regiment had captured many\r\ntons of ammunition and matériel in supply dumps, together with more\r\nthan thirty enemy trucks. The 307th Infantry put many of the latter\r\ninto serviceable condition and made immediate use of them. [1121]\r\n\r\nFor the same day, 20 December, the 306th Infantry, on the left of\r\nthe 307th, was assigned the mission of advancing to the Palompon\r\nroad. Upon reaching the road, the 1st Battalion on the left would\r\nturn west along it to seize a bridge crossing the Togbong River and\r\nthe 3d Battalion would turn east to seize the junction of the road\r\nand Highway 2. [1122] During the night the enemy artillery heavily\r\nshelled the sector of the regiment. After a ten-minute artillery\r\npreparation the assault battalions moved out at 0830, and by 0925\r\nthey had reached the Palompon road. Each of the battalions thereupon\r\nstarted to execute its part of the mission.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Battalion pushed steadily forward and reached the eastern\r\nbanks of the Togbong River at the bridge crossing, the bridge itself\r\nhaving been destroyed by the enemy. From a commanding ridge upon\r\nthe western banks of the river, just north of the bridge site, a\r\nJapanese force estimated to be a battalion in strength opposed any\r\nfurther advance. The company on the left forced a passage across the\r\nriver south of the bridge site, but the company on the right, despite\r\nrepeated attempts, was unable to cross the river. At 1630 the 1st\r\nBattalion received orders to take up a night defensive position on the\r\neastern banks of the river. During the night the enemy unsuccessfully\r\nlaunched three counterattacks against the 1st Battalion. In the morning\r\nthe battalion counted more than 400 Japanese dead around its position.\r\n\r\nThe 3d Battalion, 306th Infantry, upon reaching the Palompon road\r\nturned east and encountered steadily increasing enemy opposition. By\r\n1500, however, Company K reached the road junction. At the same\r\ntime the 3d Battalion received orders to withdraw west 300 yards\r\nso that the 307th Infantry could register unrestricted fire to its\r\nfront. This withdrawal was carried out and the 3d and 2d Battalions\r\nof the 306th Infantry established night positions 300 yards west of\r\nthe road junction.\r\n\r\nAt 1900 General Bruce ordered the 306th Infantry to deliver harassing\r\nfire on the enemy forces to the west during the night of 20-21 December\r\nand the 307th Infantry to fire 500 yards to its front up Highway 2\r\nand east of the highway. [1123]\r\n\r\nThe Japanese 5th Infantry Regiment had assembled in the Libongao\r\nsector with orders to proceed to the Valencia sector, but the 77th\r\nDivision had advanced so rapidly that it was attacking the 35th Army\r\nHeadquarters. The Takahashi Detachment suffered heavy casualties\r\nand withdrew to Matagob, on the Palompon road between Palompon and\r\nLibongao. The field artillery battalion and the engineering and\r\ntransportation companies that had been left at Matagob were absorbed\r\nby the Takahashi Detachment. On 21 December General Suzuki ordered\r\nthe regiment to make a defensive stand, so that the main force of\r\nthe 35th Army could withdraw to the Palompon sector on the shore of\r\nthe Camotes Sea. [1124]\r\n\r\nDuring the night of 20-21 December the 77th Division artillery expended\r\nhalf a unit of fire, intermittently bombarding enemy positions west\r\nof the 77th Division and to the east of Highway 2. The bombardment was\r\nthe most intensive made by the 77th Division during the campaign. Just\r\nbefore renewal of the attack on 21 December, the artillery delivered\r\na concentrated thirty-minute preparation. General Bruce ordered the\r\n306th Infantry to move out at 0630. Since the 1st Battalion was short\r\nof ammunition, it was to await the arrival of Company E, which had\r\nbeen attached to the battalion, with additional ammunition. At 1250,\r\nhaving received the ammunition, the battalion moved out and at 1330\r\nsecured the ridge (overlooking the bridge site), which had blocked\r\nits advance the previous day.\r\n\r\nImmediately afterward General Bruce ordered the battalion to proceed\r\nwest along the Palompon road and secure the bridge over the Pagsangahan\r\nRiver. The ridge was thereupon outposted as the 1st Battalion withdrew\r\nto prepare for continuation of the assault, but elements of the 5th\r\nInfantry Regiment drove the outposts off the ridge and immediately\r\noccupied it. At 1500 the 1st Battalion attacked unsuccessfully in\r\nan effort to retake the position. It formed a night perimeter at the\r\nriver crossing at 1600, and at 0750 concentrated a ten-minute artillery\r\npreparation on the enemy positions on the ridge. The 1st Battalion\r\nthen moved out toward the high ground and secured the ridge within\r\ntwenty minutes, the Japanese offering only slight resistance. [1125]\r\n\r\nThe 77th Division had reached the Palompon road. In its drive north\r\nthe division had destroyed the major elements of the 5th and 77th\r\nInfantry Regiments and the 4th Airborne Regiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 32d Division Resumes the Offensive\r\n\r\nElements of the X Corps were slowly moving south in an attempt to\r\neffect a juncture with the XXIV Corps. On 14 December the 126th and\r\n127th Infantry Regiments of the 32d Division had pushed south down\r\nHighway 2 against very determined resistance and through mountainous\r\nterrain to the main defense line of the 1st Division. The Japanese\r\nwere well entrenched on a series of ridges overlooking Highway\r\n2. A heavy rain forest covered the ridges and the deep ravines in\r\nbetween. The enemy had carefully selected his defensive positions\r\nand camouflaged his machine guns, which were flanked by hidden\r\nriflemen. Targets could not be spotted beyond a range of about\r\nseventy-five feet. The employment of mortars was very limited because\r\nof the lack of visibility, and the hazards of tree burst were equally\r\ndangerous to both the Japanese and the Americans. The troops had to\r\n\"approach within spitting distance of the [Japanese machine] guns\"\r\nbefore they could locate the weapons. [1126]\r\n\r\nFor the next few days the regiments of the 32d Division fought\r\nvaliantly against a foe that limited the division's advance to a few\r\nscore yards a day. Of the many acts of individual bravery, those of\r\nPfc. Dick J. Vlug and Sgt. Leroy Johnson were outstanding. Private\r\nVlug single-handedly destroyed five enemy tanks that were moving\r\nnorth along the highway. Sergeant Johnson threw himself upon an enemy\r\ngrenade that killed him but did not hurt those comrades near him. Both\r\nmen were awarded the Medal of Honor.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of 17 December advance elements of the 126th Infantry\r\nwere about 4,000 yards south of Limon. After a preparation of heavy\r\nmortar fire the 1st Battalion moved out at 0730, encountering about a\r\nplatoon of the enemy on a knoll 300 yards east of the road. A bitter\r\nfire fight broke out and continued throughout the day. The battalion\r\nwas unable to advance farther and set up a night perimeter. During\r\nthe fight the 1st Battalion captured four enemy machine guns.\r\n\r\nIn the zone of the 2d Battalion, east of the highway, all the\r\nbattalion's mortars, machine guns, and 37-mm. guns, together with four\r\nmedium tanks, massed their combined fires on the enemy positions to\r\nthe front. These positions consisted of numerous foxholes, pillboxes\r\nof coconut logs, and L-shaped fortifications dug into the mountain\r\nsides. A rain of steel descended upon the Japanese on the high\r\nground directly east of the battalion. This preparatory fire had\r\nexcellent results and the 2d Battalion, after moving out at 1100,\r\nquickly secured the ridge and consolidated its position. It captured\r\nthree 47-mm. antitank guns, three 75-mm. mountain guns, and two\r\n70-mm. battalion guns. About 150 of the enemy were killed by the\r\npreparatory fire and the battalion attack.\r\n\r\nCompany I, 3d Battalion, quickly secured and destroyed a roadblock\r\nthat the enemy had constructed the previous day. Accompanied by the\r\nfour tanks, the company then advanced down the highway just behind\r\nthe 2d Battalion without encountering opposition. For the rest of\r\nthe day the 3d Battalion protected the road and patrolled five or six\r\nhundred yards to the rear. The 127th Infantry to the south remained\r\nin position awaiting the 126th Infantry. [1127]\r\n\r\nBy the following morning, 18 December, the 126th Infantry was on a\r\nline that extended east of Highway 2. To the front of the regiment,\r\nelements of the 1st Division occupied three positions on an east-west\r\nline approximately 800 yards in length and extending across Highway\r\n2. There were actually three ridges along this line. The first ran\r\nnorth and south beside the road, and on it was located the western\r\nposition of the enemy. From this site the Japanese were able to\r\nroll hand grenades down on the road. About 200 yards to the east\r\nwas another strongly fortified north-south ridge, east of which was\r\na small valley with a banana grove. Still farther east was a small\r\nknoll upon which was located a strong enemy defensive position. An\r\nestimated two reinforced enemy companies, well supported by automatic\r\nweapons and well dug in, occupied this position. The whole area was\r\ncovered with a dense rain forest, and it was impossible to spot any\r\nJapanese fortified position more than thirty yards away.\r\n\r\nBefore the troops moved out, the mortars and tanks placed heavy fire\r\non the Japanese positions for twenty minutes. At 1010 on 18 December\r\nthe 126th Infantry attacked with the 1st Battalion on the right and\r\nthe 2d Battalion on the left. In advancing to the ridge nearest the\r\nroad, the American troops received considerable small arms fire just\r\neast of the road. The 1st Battalion moved ahead up the ridge east\r\nof the road and by 1230 it had advanced 200 yards to the top of the\r\nridge. The Japanese resisted strongly and heavy fighting occurred\r\nin which both sides used machine guns, grenades, and bayonets. By\r\n1800 the 1st Battalion was in firm possession of the ridge. The 2d\r\nBattalion, supported by machine guns and mortars, was able to creep\r\nup through the forested ravine to within thirty yards of the enemy\r\nposition on the knoll before it was fired upon. A bitter engagement\r\nthen ensued. After five hours of intense fighting the battalion drove\r\nthe Japanese defenders off the knoll. The 1st and 2d Battalions formed\r\ntheir night perimeters within fifty yards of the enemy front lines. The\r\n3d Battalion of the 126th Infantry moved south along the road and\r\nclosed the gap between the 126th and 127th Infantry Regiments. [1128]\r\nThe artillery fired upon several buildings about 800 to 1,500 yards\r\nsouthwest of the forward elements of the 32d Division. Lucrative\r\nartillery targets were practically nonexistent. [1129]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of 19 December the 126th Infantry followed the same\r\nprocedure that had been used the previous day. A heavy machine gun\r\nand mortar concentration was placed upon the Japanese positions on\r\nthe crest of a ridge fifty yards to the front. At 1100 the 126th\r\nInfantry moved out with battalions abreast, the 1st Battalion on\r\nthe right and the 2d on the left. Six heavy machine guns immediately\r\nfired on the left flank of the 1st Battalion. The battalion withdrew\r\nand placed a concentration of more than 200 rounds of mortar fire\r\non the position while its machine guns raked the Japanese force\r\n\"fore and aft.\" The troops then renewed the assault but the Japanese\r\ncontinued to resist. Elements of the 1st Division had dug in on the\r\ntop and both sides of a ridge and had utilized caves to construct\r\na defensive position in which there were more than 100 foxholes\r\nwith communicating trenches. Heavy fighting continued throughout the\r\nday. The 1st Battalion used mortars, flame throwers, white phosphorus\r\ngrenades, hand grenades, rifles, and supporting flanking fire from its\r\nheavy and light machine guns, but was able to advance only seventy-five\r\nyards. Although the battalion overran many emplacements, a determined\r\nJapanese force remained to be overcome when the battalion established\r\nits night perimeter on the eastern slope of the ridge.\r\n\r\nThe 2d Battalion, 126th Infantry, encountered only scattered rifle\r\nfire that came principally from the enemy position on its right\r\nflank. During its advance the battalion delivered flanking machine\r\ngun and rifle fire in support of the 1st Battalion on its right. By\r\n1200 the 2d Battalion had advanced 200 yards and secured the area in\r\nits zone of action. At 1530 the 1st Squadron, 112th Cavalry, which\r\nhad been protecting the eastern flank of the 32d Division, relieved\r\nthe 2d Battalion, which withdrew to an assembly area in the rear.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of 19-20 December, the commanding officer of\r\nCompany B, 126th Infantry, which had borne the brunt of the enemy\r\nresistance, placed one platoon of the company along the eastern side\r\nof the ridge and another platoon on the western side. At the same\r\ntime he continued the pressure from the south. Throughout the night\r\nthe company kept firing at known enemy positions and the sector in\r\ngeneral. The company commander also required each of his men to throw\r\nhand grenades periodically. At first light and without any breakfast\r\nthe troops rushed the enemy position. The Japanese had lost the power\r\nto resist and by 1000 the company had taken the last of the three\r\nenemy positions. Two hundred Japanese dead were counted in the area.\r\n\r\nAt 1245 on 20 December the 127th Infantry took over the conquered\r\nsector and the 1st Battalion, 126th Infantry, withdrew to an assembly\r\narea in the rear. [1130]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDebouchment From the Mountains\r\n\r\nSince the 32d Division had borne the brunt of the assault, General\r\nSibert ordered the 1st Cavalry Division to make the main attack\r\nsouth. It was to assist the advance of the 32d Division to a bridge\r\n1,000 yards north of Lonoy and then move south and make contact\r\nwith the 77th Division. [1131] The 1st Cavalry Division had been\r\noperating in the central mountain chain on the eastern flank of the\r\n32d Division and had been opposed by the 102d Division. The latter,\r\nafter its arrival at Ormoc, had gone directly into the mountains in\r\nthe vicinity of Mt. Pina. [1132] The 102d Division did not play a\r\nsignificant role in the Leyte campaign.\r\n\r\nThe 112th Cavalry Regimental Combat Team had moved south on the eastern\r\nflank of the 32d Division. The 1st Squadron of the 112th Cavalry had\r\nbeen able to keep pace with the 32d Division, but the 2d Squadron\r\nhad encountered a very strong enemy force on a ridge overlooking the\r\nLeyte River south of Limon. The Japanese resisted all the squadron's\r\nefforts to dislodge them. The 2d Squadron, 7th Cavalry, relieved the\r\n2d Squadron, 112th Cavalry, and on 14 December it had succeeded in\r\novercoming the Japanese and had seized the ridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpearhead of the Assault\r\n\r\nWhile the 112th and 7th Cavalry Regiments were busily engaged in\r\ndefending the east flank of the 32d Division in its push south along\r\nHighway 2, the 12th Cavalry was mopping up enemy groups entrenched in\r\nthe mountains farther to the east. Particularly strong enemy resistance\r\nhad been encountered in the Mt. Badian and Hill 2348 sector, which was\r\nabout five miles northeast of Kananga, a barrio on Highway 2. [1133]\r\nIn the process of reducing the Japanese-held area, it was estimated\r\nthat an enemy force of 500 to 600 men had been wiped out. From 28\r\nNovember to 9 December, the 12th Cavalry remained in the Mt. Badian and\r\nHill 2348 sector, sent out westward patrols, and slowly moved westward.\r\n\r\nOn 10 December, General Sibert decided to have elements of the 1st\r\nCavalry Division debouch from the mountains onto Highway 2 south of\r\nthe 32d Division and in the Lonoy area. This move was to be concurrent\r\nwith the expected advance of the 32d Division down the highway. [1134]\r\nThe 1st Squadron, 12th Cavalry, was in the vicinity of Mt. Cabungaan,\r\nand the 2d Squadron, on Hill 2348, was 2,000 yards northeast of\r\nthe 1st Squadron. An enemy strong point existed to the north of the\r\nperimeter of the 1st Squadron. The 12th Cavalry spent 10 December\r\nin making preparations for a two-squadron assault against this enemy\r\nforce. The plan was for the 1st Squadron to attack at 0830 while the\r\n2d Squadron from Hill 2348 supported the attack by enveloping the\r\nleft flank of the enemy. In furtherance of this plan Troop E of the\r\n2d Squadron moved off Hill 2348 at 0800 toward the southwest and dug\r\nin for the night just north of Mt. Cabungaan. [1135]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of 11 December, an intense mortar and artillery\r\nconcentration was placed upon the enemy position in front of the 1st\r\nSquadron. The fire was so close that fragments frequently fell on the\r\nwaiting assault troops. After this fire, the 1st Squadron with Troop A\r\nin the lead moved out at 0715. At the same time Troop E attacked from\r\nthe northeast. The enemy defenses consisted of seven or eight pillboxes\r\nand many caves dug into the very rugged terrain. The men of Troop A,\r\nclosely followed by Troop B, charged up the hill \"throwing grenades\r\nand firing from the hip.\" [1136] The hill fell to the 1st Squadron at\r\n1003 after very heavy hand-to-hand fighting. Troop E had been held\r\nup by the terrain and was unable to assist the 1st Squadron. After\r\nthe capture of the Japanese position, patrols established contact\r\nwith Troop E at 1200. The regimental reconnaissance platoon returned\r\nfrom the vicinity of Lonoy with the information that the Japanese\r\nhad prepared strong defensive positions in that area. The platoon\r\nhad gained a good observation point 900 yards east of Lonoy. [1137]\r\nThe next several days were spent in sending out patrols and moving\r\nthe 2d Squadron to the position of the 1st Squadron.\r\n\r\nOn 14 December, the 12th Cavalry was ordered to continue west to\r\nHighway 2 and assist the advance of the 32d Division, to establish a\r\nroadblock on the highway, and to attack the hostile forces to the north\r\nbetween it and the 32d Division. [1138] In furtherance of this order,\r\nthe 1st Squadron, less A and C Troops, moved west on 15 December toward\r\na previously reconnoitered area that was about 1,800 yards east of the\r\nbarrio of Lonoy. This site, a banana plantation, was chosen for its\r\nobservation facilities to the west and as an excellent dropping ground\r\nfor supplies. The 1st Squadron, having encountered little opposition,\r\nclosed on the area before dusk. Thereupon the rest of the regiment\r\nwas ordered to close in on the area before nightfall on 17 December.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLonoy\r\n\r\nThe 12th Cavalry on 18 December sent out patrols to Lonoy, Kananga, and\r\nto the northwest to make contact with the nearest friendly troops. The\r\npatrols to Lonoy and Kananga, although they ran into scattered groups\r\nof the enemy, were able to locate suitable approaches to Lonoy for\r\ntheir squadrons. [1139]\r\n\r\nAt 2235, on 18 December, the 12th Cavalry received orders to move\r\nout the following morning, seize Lonoy, and be prepared to seize\r\nKananga. The commanding officer of the regiment decided to have the\r\n1st and 2d Squadrons move out abreast with the 2d Squadron on the\r\nleft. During the entire night the artillery was to deliver harassing\r\nfire on the highway north of Lonoy and on the area between the routes\r\nof approach of the two squadrons.\r\n\r\nAfter a preparation on 19 December, the 1st and 2d Squadrons moved\r\nout at 0800. The 1st Squadron met only light, sporadic resistance. The\r\ntroops observed many Japanese proceeding north along the highway and\r\nhad mortar and artillery fires placed upon them. At 1200, the 1st\r\nSquadron seized Lonoy, captured much enemy equipment, and destroyed\r\nmany supply dumps. The 1st Squadron moved to assist the 2d Squadron\r\nin the capture of a knoll southeast of the barrio. The 1st Squadron\r\nclosed on the knoll about 1400, and aided the assault of the 2d\r\nSquadron by fire and by sending a troop east to assist it.\r\n\r\nThe 2d Squadron jumped off on schedule but at 0930, when it was 800\r\nyards short of its objective, the squadron came under heavy rifle\r\nand machine gun fire from the thick woods. The 271st Field Artillery\r\nBattalion placed fire on the area and a great many of the enemy were\r\nkilled, the remainder fleeing south. The squadron received additional\r\nmachine gun fire from the north but a patrol quickly silenced it. In\r\nthe meantime the mortar platoon from Troop D, in support of the 1st\r\nSquadron, fired upon Lonoy. The Japanese immediately responded with\r\nfire from a 105-mm. gun, which they had cleverly concealed in the gap\r\nbetween the two squadrons and about 600 yards from the regimental\r\nobservation post at which the gun directed its fire. The enemy\r\ngun killed one man and wounded fifteen others of the command-post\r\ngroup. The heavy machine guns from the Weapons troop and the artillery\r\nfrom the 271st Field Artillery Battalion began concentrating their\r\nfires upon the enemy gun. The Antitank Platoon was sent out to destroy\r\nthe gun and its crew. Following the machine gun and artillery fire,\r\nthe enemy gun was silent for about half an hour. It then suddenly\r\nopened up against the 2d Squadron at a range of about 300 yards. The\r\nenemy fire resulted in tree bursts which killed five men and wounded\r\nfifteen others. Troop G, which suffered the most casualties, and\r\nthe Antitank Platoon immediately turned and attacked to the north to\r\ndestroy the gun. The 2d Squadron, less Troop G, renewed the attack\r\ntowards Lonoy, receiving scattered rifle fire. At 1730 it reached\r\nLonoy and was in contact with the 1st Squadron.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Troop G sideslipped to the west and with the Antitank\r\nPlatoon attacked and destroyed the enemy gun and four of its crew. A\r\npatrol located another enemy 105-mm. gun but, because of darkness and\r\npoint-blank fire from the weapon at a range of about twenty-five feet,\r\nit was unable to knock out the gun. At 2200 Troops G and H, the medical\r\ngroup, and the Antitank Platoon formed a joint night perimeter. [1140]\r\n\r\nLate that night the regimental commander ordered the 2d and 1st\r\nSquadrons of the 12th Cavalry to move south on the morning of 20\r\nDecember along Highway 2 in a column of squadrons, with the 2d\r\nSquadron in the lead. During the night, in preparation for this\r\nadvance, the 271st Field Artillery Battalion fired 1,096 rounds on\r\nKananga, on the road north of Lonoy, and on sectors occupied by the\r\nenemy artillery. This fire destroyed the enemy 105-mm. gun.\r\n\r\nAt 0715 on the morning of 20 December the 2d Squadron, less Troop G,\r\nmoved out and immediately came under heavy fire from enemy forces that\r\nhad dug in underneath houses and behind small pieces of cover along the\r\nroad. The squadron eliminated these pockets of resistance by direct\r\nfire and by flanking movements on both sides of the highway. At 1200\r\nthe 2d Squadron forced the Japanese off a ridge which was just east\r\nof the highway and about 500 yards north of Kananga. The squadron\r\nthen encountered heavy rifle and machine gun fire that came from a\r\ncoconut grove and some houses about 200 yards south of the ridge.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the 1st Squadron, at 0830, moved south to support\r\nthe attack of the 2d Squadron. At about 1230, the 1st Squadron arrived\r\nbehind the ridge occupied by the 2d Squadron and then continued south,\r\nat 1500, seizing and completely dominating a ridge about fifty yards\r\neast of Kananga. The 2d Squadron and a platoon from the 1st Squadron\r\nattacked north, parallel to the highway, and by nightfall cleaned\r\nout the coconut grove and set up a night perimeter.\r\n\r\nGeneral Mudge, commanding general of the 1st Cavalry Division, said\r\nof the 12th Cavalry:\r\n\r\n\r\n    As a result of the stout-hearted efforts of the 12th Cavalry\r\n    Regiment, elements of the Division are within 2,500 yards of making\r\n    contact with forward elements of the 77th Division. Considering\r\n    the fact that the regiment has been reduced to 50% strength by the\r\n    rigors and deprivations of 40 days in the mountains, the display\r\n    of courage, stamina, and drive on the part of the 12th Cavalry is a\r\n    credit to the best traditions of the United States Cavalry. [1141]\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the night General Mudge ordered the 12th Cavalry to move out\r\nat 0800 21 December, seize Kananga, and then make physical contact\r\nwith the 77th Division, which was pushing north from Libongao. He\r\nattached the 1st Squadron, 5th Cavalry, to the 12th Cavalry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJuncture of Forces\r\n\r\nOn the morning of 21 December the 1st and 2d Squadrons of the 12th\r\nCavalry, supported by the 271st Field Artillery Battalion, moved out\r\nin a co-ordinated assault against Kananga. The 1st Squadron attacked\r\nfrom the north while the 2d Squadron drove in from the ridge on the\r\neast. The first elements of the regiment reached Kananga at 1157 and\r\nby 1425 the 12th Cavalry was in the town. The regiment methodically\r\ncleared out every hut, ferreted out each Japanese, and destroyed every\r\ninstallation. While the mopping up was going on, patrols from the 12th\r\nCavalry pushed to the south to make contact with the 77th Division.\r\n\r\nThe regimental commander ordered the commander of the 3d Battalion,\r\n306th Infantry, to push east at 0730 on 21 December along the\r\nPalompon road to the juncture of the road with Highway 2 and then\r\nturn north for 1,000 yards and attempt to establish contact with the\r\n1st Cavalry Division. The 3d Battalion moved out on time, and within\r\nfifteen minutes reached the road junction and turned north. The\r\nbattalion had gone only 200 yards north when its left-flank company\r\ncame under intense fire from a ridge overlooking the road. The 2d\r\nBattalion complied with orders from the regimental commander to\r\n\"put out something\" on the 3d Battalion's left flank and sent out\r\none rifle company to envelop the enemy position. This move relieved\r\nthe pressure to some extent but the advance was still slow and costly.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the 307th Infantry reached the road junction at 0800,\r\nhaving advanced without incident. With the slowing up of the 306th\r\nInfantry, General Bruce ordered the commander of the 307th Infantry\r\nRegiment to send forward additional troops. The 2d Battalion, 307th\r\nInfantry, and the Cannon and Antitank Companies of the regiment were\r\nsent to the front to reinforce the 306th Infantry. This maneuver was\r\nsuccessful and the attacking forces pushed forward.\r\n\r\nAt 1645, the 306th Infantry and Troop A of the 12th Cavalry made\r\nphysical contact. At 1115 on 22 December, Col. John H. Stadler, the\r\ncommanding officer of the 12th Cavalry, representing General Mudge,\r\nmet General Bruce at a bridge south of Kananga. The X and XXIV Corps\r\nhad joined hands. Highway 2 was at long last open for its entire\r\ndistance from Ormoc to Pinamopoan. [1142]\r\n\r\nThe Ormoc Valley, in which the Japanese had so tenaciously resisted the\r\nAmerican advance, was now securely in the hands of the Sixth Army. The\r\nnorthern and southern prongs of the trap had closed. There remained\r\nonly Palompon as an exit for the Japanese forces. To the securing of\r\nthat port, the X and XXIV Corps, acting in concert, could concentrate\r\ntheir main efforts. Plans had been readied. The Sixth Army was poised\r\nin a position from which it could drive westward to the sea and bring\r\nthe Leyte campaign to a successful conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nWestward to the Sea\r\n\r\n\r\nThe co-ordinated pressure exerted from the north and south on the\r\nJapanese forces in the Ormoc area had compelled the commander of the\r\n35th Army to make successive changes in his plans. General Suzuki had\r\nabandoned the aerial and ground assault against the Burauen airfields,\r\ntransferred the field base of the 35th Army from Ormoc to Palompon\r\nand, finally, had found it necessary to order the remaining Japanese\r\nunits on Leyte to retreat to the hills behind Ormoc Valley. General\r\nTomochika said afterward, \"The best that the 35th Army could do from\r\nthen on was to hold out as long as possible.\" [1143]\r\n\r\nThe northwestern mountains of Leyte west of Ormoc Bay provided a\r\ndifficult barrier to any movement toward the northwest coast. The\r\narea was the last one available to the Japanese either for escaping\r\nfrom Leyte or for staging defensive actions. In general, the terrain\r\nwas rough, increasing in altitude from broken ground and low hills\r\nin the north to steep rocky ridges and high hills in the south. The\r\nnorthern part was either under cultivation or covered with cogon\r\ngrass. Toward the south, the cultivated fields and grasslands were\r\ngradually supplanted by dense forests.\r\n\r\nPalompon had been extensively used by the Japanese as an auxiliary\r\nport of entry to Leyte. The town was the western terminus of the\r\nroad that ran north and eastward across the northwestern hills to\r\njoin Highway 2 near Libongao. (Map 23) It was this road junction that\r\nthe X and XXIV Corps had seized. The Palompon road, as it was called,\r\nfollowed the lower slopes of the hills until the flat interior valley\r\nfloor was reached. The confining hills were steep-sided with many\r\nknife-edged crests. [1144] Such was the area into which the forces\r\nof the Sixth Army had driven remnants of the Japanese 35th Army.\r\n\r\nWhen the 77th Infantry Division and the 1st Cavalry Division joined\r\nforces on 21 December just south of Kananga, Highway 2 between Ormoc\r\nand Pinamopoan was opened to the Americans. The Sixth Army, anxious to\r\ndeliver the coup de grâce, arranged its troops for a four-division\r\nthrust to the west coast on a long front. In the south the 77th\r\nDivision was to drive west along the Palompon road. To its right\r\n(north) there would be, from left to right, the 1st Cavalry Division\r\nand the 32d and 24th Infantry Divisions. The Sixth Army had started the\r\nLeyte Campaign with two corps on a four-division front and was ending\r\nits part in the campaign with two corps on a four-division front.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 77th Division Goes West\r\n\r\nOverwater to Palompon [1145]\r\n\r\nGuerrillas had informed General Bruce that the bridges on the road\r\nthat wound through the mountains from the vicinity of Libongao to\r\nPalompon either were intact or could be quickly repaired. General\r\nBruce decided to verify this by having an engineer patrol work with\r\nthe guerrillas and by having a reconnaissance made over the area in\r\na cub plane. On 19 December General Bruce directed that a fast-moving\r\nforce be organized to operate along the road to Palompon. The engineers\r\nlater informed him that because of the condition of many of the bridges\r\nit would be impossible to send an advance column along the road. [1146]\r\n\r\nOn 21 December General Hodge, anticipating the juncture of the X and\r\nXXIV Corps, ordered the 77th Division to be prepared after that event\r\nto move rapidly west and seize the Palompon area. [1147] On 22 December\r\nGeneral Krueger, acting on a recommendation that had been made by\r\nGeneral Bruce through General Hodge, [1148] informed Admiral Kinkaid\r\nthat it might be possible to expedite the capture of Palompon by\r\nhaving an infantry battalion, utilizing amphibian vehicles and LCM's,\r\nmake an amphibious movement from Ormoc to the vicinity of Palompon. He\r\ntherefore asked Admiral Kinkaid if naval support to escort and guide\r\nthis movement could be furnished for either the night of 23-24 or\r\nthat of 24-25 December. If possible, the amphibious force should\r\nhave a destroyer escort. [1149] Admiral Kinkaid stated, in reply,\r\nthat because of preparations for other operations it would be \"most\r\ndifficult\" to provide a destroyer escort but that he could furnish a\r\nPT escort which he believed would be sufficient protection. [1150]\r\nThis was satisfactory to General Krueger and he ordered the XXIV\r\nCorps to make plans for the amphibious movement. [1151] In turn\r\nGeneral Hodge told General Bruce to prepare for the operation.\r\n\r\nOn 22 December, General Bruce put his plan into operation. The 1st\r\nBattalion, 305th Infantry, was to make the amphibious landing in the\r\nvicinity of Palompon while the 2d and 3d Battalions were to proceed\r\nwest along the Palompon road, after moving in trucks from Valencia to\r\nthe Palompon road near the Togbong River. Previously, on 21 December,\r\nBattery A of the 531st Field Artillery Battalion (155-mm. gun) was\r\nbrought with a great deal of effort to a position near San Jose from\r\nwhich it could fire on Palompon, which the guerrillas and civilians\r\nhad received instructions to evacuate. [1152]\r\n\r\nThe 1st Battalion was to commence loading at 1400 on 23 December\r\nat Ormoc. The convoy was to be protected en route by patrol torpedo\r\nboats and close air support. Upon arriving at Palompon at 0500 on 25\r\nDecember, the mortar-firing LCM's were to bombard the shore before\r\nthe assault forces moved in. Beginning 23 December, the artillery of\r\nthe 77th Division was to bombard Palompon and to continue as long as\r\nLt. Col. James E. Landrum, the task force commander, desired it. [1153]\r\n\r\nThe 1st Battalion was to move ashore on the beach about 1,500 yards\r\nnorth of Palompon with Companies C and B in assault, Company C on the\r\nleft. Its mission was to destroy the enemy force in Palompon and then\r\nturn north. [1154]\r\n\r\nIn support of the proposed landing, aircraft from the Fifth Air\r\nForce bombed Palompon on 23 December. The results were \"hot stuff,\"\r\nan overenthusiastic observer reported, claiming that \"only half of\r\ntwo houses were left standing in the whole town.\" [1155]\r\n\r\nOn 23 December, the reinforced 1st Battalion moved to Ormoc to prepare\r\nfor the amphibious landing and at 1930 on 24 December the troops\r\nembarked. [1156] The convoy departed at 2000. The vessels included,\r\nin addition to the mechanized landing craft, the LVT's of the 718th\r\nand 536th Amphibian Tractor Battalions. They made the tedious ten-hour\r\ntrip without incident as far as enemy action was concerned, although\r\nthree of the LVT's \"sank owing to mechanical failure.\"\r\n\r\nThe vessels took position off the landing beaches on the morning\r\nof 25 December. After the 155-mm. guns of the 531st Field Artillery\r\nBattalion had fired from positions near San Jose, twelve and a half\r\nmiles east of Palompon, the mortar boats of the 2d Engineer Special\r\nBrigade softened up the beaches. The landing waves then started for the\r\nshore, the first wave landing at 0720 and the last one at 0755. They\r\nreceived no hostile fire.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile,\" wrote General Bruce, \"the Division Commander could stand\r\nit no longer and called for a plane, flew soon after daylight across\r\nthe mountains and seaward, located the amphibious forces still at\r\nsea, ... witnessed the preparatory fires by the 155-mm. guns and that\r\nfrom the mortar boats ... saw them going in ... and advance to the\r\nbeach. (He obeyed a rather boyish impulse and flew from 25 to 50 feet\r\nabove the heads of the troops in the assault boats and leaned out,\r\ngiving a boxer's victory sign with both hands.)\" [1157]\r\n\r\nThe troops quickly organized on the beach. A light fast armored\r\ncolumn moved north to clear the road and to forestall any Japanese\r\ncounterattack from that direction as the rest of the task force went\r\nrapidly south through the barrio of Look to Palompon, which fell at\r\n1206. This closed the last main port of entrance on the island to the\r\nJapanese. Within four hours after hitting the beaches the battalion\r\nhad secured the barrios of Buaya and Look as well as Palompon, and had\r\nstrong patrols operating to the northeast and south. The troops met no\r\nopposition at any point. It was doubtless with great satisfaction that\r\nGeneral Bruce sent the following message to the Commanding General,\r\nXXIV Corps: \"The 77th Infantry Division's Christmas contribution to\r\nthe Leyte Campaign is the capture of Palompon, the last main port of\r\nthe enemy. We are all grateful to the Almighty on this birthday of the\r\nSon and on the Season of the Feast of Lights.\" [1158] The 1st Battalion\r\nreceived \"warm congratulations and thanks\" from General Krueger. [1159]\r\n\r\nThe 1st Battalion occupied a defensive position in the vicinity of Look\r\non 25 December, and rested on 26 December, which was Christmas Day back\r\nhome. It spent the next five days sending out patrols and awaiting the\r\narrival through the mountains of the rest of the 305th Infantry. On 30\r\nDecember, Company C made a reconnaissance in force and an amphibious\r\nlanding at Abijao, about seven miles north of Palompon. The company\r\novercame some Japanese resistance and burned down the town to prevent\r\nits reoccupation. It then pushed 1,300 yards north and established\r\nradio contact with elements of the 1st Cavalry Division, which had\r\npushed through the mountains to the vicinity of Villaba. [1160]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Palompon Road\r\n\r\nThe Palompon road wound through the mountains and crossed many rivers,\r\nover which some forty bridges would have to be built or repaired. It\r\nran northwest two and a half miles from the Togbong River to the\r\nbarrio of Humaybunay and then cut sharply to the southwest for about\r\nfour miles to Matagob, at which point it went into the hills almost\r\ndirectly south for about 2,000 yards, and then turned south-southwest\r\nfor 1,000 yards. At this point it turned and twisted to the southwest\r\nfor approximately five and a half miles to the vicinity of San Miguel,\r\nfrom where it arched 3,500 yards to Look, on the Camotes Sea.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese had pockmarked Matagob and the area surrounding it\r\nwith foxholes and emplacements and had dug spider holes under the\r\nhouses. South of Matagob, where the road climbed into the hills, the\r\nenemy had utilized natural caves, gullies, and ridges on both sides\r\nof the road and dug many deep defensive positions. Some of these were\r\neight feet deep, two feet in diameter at the top, and widened to six\r\nfeet at the bottom. The Japanese had emplaced machine guns in culverts\r\nand had constructed several well-camouflaged coconut log pillboxes\r\non the forward slopes of the ridges. An excellent, almost invisible\r\ninstallation, which served as an observation post, was dug in on the\r\nforward slope of a ridge about three miles north of San Miguel. It\r\nhad a concealed entrance on the reverse slope. From this post eight\r\nmiles of the road to the north and east could be observed.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese 5th Infantry Regiment was the principal enemy unit in the\r\nsector, although remnants of other units retreating west from Highway\r\n2 were in the area. The following Japanese units were identified: 1st,\r\n3d, and 6th Batteries of the 8th Field Artillery Regiment; elements\r\nof the 8th Division Signal Unit; the 8th Transport Regiment; and the\r\n8th Engineer Regiment. Although intelligence officers estimated that\r\nthere were between 2,000 and 3,000 enemy troops in the sector, only\r\na force of about battalion strength opposed the 305th Infantry. The\r\nrest had scattered into the hills to the northwest.\r\n\r\nAt 0700, on 22 December, the 2d Battalion, 305th Infantry, left\r\nValencia followed at 1035 by the 3d Battalion. The 2d Battalion crossed\r\nthe Togbong River, moved through the 1st Battalion, 306th Infantry,\r\nand at 1030 attacked along the Palompon road. The battalion had\r\nadvanced 1,600 yards northwest by 1230 and secured the Pagsangahan\r\nRiver crossing. The assault continued with the 3d Battalion coming\r\nup on the right flank of the 2d. The battalions moved through rice\r\npaddies and through Humaybunay and established a night perimeter\r\nabout one mile southwest of the barrio.\r\n\r\nThe 302d Engineer Battalion, which followed behind the assault\r\nbattalions, fought the \"battle of bridges.\" [1161] The engineers\r\nworked around the clock, frequently without any infantry protection,\r\nto restore the bridges as soon as possible. The bridges were to\r\nbe sufficiently strengthened initially to support 2 1/2-ton truck\r\ntraffic for infantry supply, then they were to be reinforced to carry\r\n20 tons in order to bring M8's forward, and eventually to 36-ton\r\ncapacity to carry the M10's. General Bruce had hoped that sufficient\r\nBailey bridges could be made available for important crossings to\r\ncarry traffic while engineers built wooden bridges under the Bailey\r\nbridges. Only a limited number of Bailey bridges were furnished,\r\nhowever, and engineer progress to the west was slowed down. [1162]\r\n\r\nThe assault battalions of the 305th Infantry that were astride the\r\nPalompon road spent a quiet night. They had before them the enemy's\r\nstrongly fortified positions at Matagob. At 0830 on 23 December, the\r\n2d Battalion moved out, followed at 1130 by the 3d Battalion. The 2d\r\nBattalion moved forward west of the road while the 3d advanced east\r\nof the road. Intermittent enemy rifle fire fell upon the 2d Battalion\r\nbut it pushed ahead steadily. At 1500, the 2d Battalion was 500 yards\r\nbeyond Matagob and the 3d was 300 yards behind the 2d. The troops\r\ncame under heavy fire from two enemy 75-mm. guns on the hills west of\r\nMatagob and suffered several casualties. The mortars and artillery\r\nwith the 305th Infantry silenced the Japanese guns. The regimental\r\ncommander issued orders for the battalions to move out for the assault\r\nat 1000 on the following day against the regimental objective, a road\r\nbend that was 2,000 yards to its front. The 2d Battalion set up its\r\nnight perimeter in place while the 3d Battalion withdrew to a point\r\n1,000 yards east of Matagob. The regimental command post moved from\r\nHumaybunay to the 3d Battalion perimeter. [1163]\r\n\r\nDuring the night the Japanese made several attempts to penetrate the\r\nAmerican lines. The 3d Battalion destroyed a demolition squad that\r\nentered its position, while the 2d Battalion beat back one attack\r\nat 0245 and another one, which was accompanied by mortar fire, at\r\n0630. The 305th Infantry killed an estimated 100 Japanese with no\r\ncasualties to the regiment. [1164]\r\n\r\nAt 1000 on 24 December the assault troops jumped off. The Japanese\r\nresistance was light and intermittent, but American progress was\r\nslow because of the rough, irregular hills in which the enemy had\r\nestablished positions in foxholes, spider holes, and caves. Since it\r\nwas not possible to bypass these positions, the regiment had to clear\r\neach one before the advance could continue. The force received some\r\nartillery fire but a mortar platoon from Company A, 88th Chemical\r\nWeapons Battalion, silenced the enemy guns. At 1500 the battalions\r\nset up their night perimeter 500 yards short of the road bend. During\r\nthe night a Japanese force of twenty men, which tried to penetrate\r\nthe defenses of the 3d Battalion, was killed. [1165]\r\n\r\nAt 0800 on 25 December the attack was renewed, but made very slow\r\nprogress. The enemy, dug in in small pockets along the road, resisted\r\nstubbornly. The 3d Battalion advanced 200 yards and was pinned\r\ndown by machine gun, mountain gun, and rifle fire. The 2d Battalion\r\nattempted to envelop the enemy strong point on the Japanese right\r\n(south) flank but was repulsed. [1166]\r\n\r\nOn 26 December the regiment limited its activity to patrolling. Since\r\nit was Christmas Day in the States, \"All guns of the Division Artillery\r\nfired ... at ... 1200 as a salute to the nation on Christmas Day. This\r\nwas followed by one minute of silent prayer for the dead and wounded of\r\nthe 77th Division.\" [1167] That night General Bruce ordered the troops\r\nto build bonfires and sing, and employ other ruses in the hope that the\r\nJapanese might believe that the troops were celebrating Christmas and\r\nmight therefore try to enter the defensive perimeters. These ruses were\r\nunsuccessful in the sectors of the assault battalions, but a similar\r\none employed in the area of the regimental command post attracted\r\nsome Japanese patrols, which were either destroyed or driven off.\r\n\r\nAt dawn on 27 December the 3d Battalion moved around the Japanese\r\nleft flank toward the high ground six hundred yards from the line\r\nof departure. Despite enemy artillery and machine gun fire and the\r\ndifficult terrain, the battalion reached the objective, killing 160\r\nJapanese. The remainder fled to the hills.\r\n\r\nWhen it became apparent that the Japanese resistance was strong and\r\ndetermined and might unduly delay the progress of the 305th Infantry,\r\nGeneral Bruce decided to move the 2d Battalion of the regiment\r\noverwater to the vicinity of Palompon at the western terminus of the\r\nroad. The 2d Battalion could then attack east along the road while the\r\n3d Battalion continued the attack west. The Japanese defenders would\r\nthus be under fire on their front and rear. This eastern attack force,\r\nwhich was called the Provisional Mountain Force, moved to Ormoc and\r\nthence, after arrangements had been made with the naval representatives\r\nof Krueger's staff, overwater by LCM's to Palompon. It arrived at\r\nthe latter without incident at 1500 on 28 December. On the same day\r\nthe 3d Battalion, reinforced, continued the attack westward. The\r\nJapanese resisted strongly with small arms fire from pillboxes and\r\nwith artillery. The 3d Battalion advanced approximately 1,000 yards\r\nduring the day. [1168]\r\n\r\nAt 0800 on 29 December, the 3d Battalion moved out. The battalion\r\nhad advanced 650 yards at 1000 when it encountered very determined\r\nresistance from an enemy force in very well camouflaged, dug-in\r\npositions. The troops were pinned down for the rest of the day. The\r\nProvisional Mountain Force moved out of Look at 1200 to a position\r\nfrom which it could launch its assault eastward along the road.\r\n\r\nAt 0930 on 30 December the 305th Infantry struck along the Palompon\r\nroad, the 3d Battalion driving west, and the Provisional Mountain\r\nForce attacking east. The Mountain Force encountered only scattered\r\nresistance until 0930, when the Japanese, from well-entrenched\r\npositions in the precipitous sides of the road at a point about\r\nfour miles east of Palompon, directed strong machine gun fire along\r\nthe road. The Mountain Force dug in for the night on high ground\r\noverlooking the point at which its advance had been halted. The 3d\r\nBattalion succeeded in overcoming the opposition which had halted\r\nit the previous day, and pushed forward to a point about 1,000\r\nyards southwest of Tipolo. The Japanese had emplaced artillery on\r\ncurves in the road and could fire directly on the advancing American\r\ntroops. Although the 305th Infantry lost one tank to enemy artillery\r\nfire, it was able to destroy three 75-mm. guns and capture two others\r\nintact. [1169]\r\n\r\nDuring the night, the Japanese force withdrew; only scattered troops\r\nwere left to delay the advance. At 0800 on 31 December, the assault\r\nforces of the 305th Infantry resumed the attack, and encountered only\r\nsporadic rifle fire. At 1225 at a point two miles northeast of San\r\nMiguel the 3d Battalion and the Provisional Mountain Force met. This\r\nended all organized resistance along the Palompon road and secured an\r\noverland route from Highway 2 in the Ormoc Valley to Palompon on the\r\nwest coast. [1170] The 77th Division made the astounding estimate that\r\nfor the period from 21 through 31 December 1944, it had killed 5,779\r\nJapanese, taken 29 prisoners, and had lost 17 men killed, 116 wounded,\r\nand 6 missing in action. [1171]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX Corps Goes West\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, to the north of the 77th Division, elements of the 1st\r\nCavalry Division and the 32d Infantry Division had turned off Highway\r\n2 and were pushing over the mountains to the west coast. [1172]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 1st Cavalry Division\r\n\r\nWith the clearing of Highway 2 and the junction of the X and XXIV\r\nCorps at a point just south of Kananga, the 1st Cavalry Division\r\nwas in readiness to push toward the west coast in conjunction with\r\nassaults by the 77th Division on its left and the 32d Division on its\r\nright. The troops were on a 2,500-yard front along Highway 2 between\r\nKananga and Lonoy.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of 23 December the assault units of the 1st Cavalry\r\nDivision moved out from the highway and started west. None encountered\r\nany resistance. The 1st Squadron, 12th Cavalry, established a\r\nnight perimeter on a ridge about 1,400 yards slightly northwest of\r\nKananga. The 1st Squadron, 5th Cavalry, set up a night perimeter\r\n1,000 yards north of that of the 1st Squadron, 12th Cavalry, while\r\nthe 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry, dug in for the night on a line with\r\nthe other two squadrons.\r\n\r\nThis first day's march set the pattern for the next several\r\ndays. The regiments pushed steadily forward, meeting only scattered\r\nresistance. The chief obstacles were waist-deep swamps in the zone\r\nof the 12th Cavalry. These were waded on 24 December. The tangled\r\nvegetation and sharp, precipitous ridges that were henceforward\r\nencountered also made the passage slow and difficult.\r\n\r\nOn 28 December, the foremost elements of the 5th and 12th Cavalry\r\nRegiments broke out of the mountains and reached the barrio of\r\nTibur on the west coast, about 2,800 yards north of Abijao. (See Map\r\n2.) By nightfall on the following day, the 7th Cavalry was also on\r\nthe west coast but farther north. In its advance it had encountered\r\nand destroyed many small, scattered groups of the enemy, most of\r\nwhom showed little desire to fight. The regiment arrived at Villaba,\r\ntwo and one-half miles north of Tibur, at dusk, and in securing the\r\ntown killed thirty-five Japanese.\r\n\r\nDuring the early morning hours of 31 December, the Japanese launched\r\nfour counterattacks against the forces at Villaba. Each started with\r\na bugle call, the first attack beginning at 0230 and the final one at\r\ndawn. An estimated 500 of the enemy, armed with mortars, machine guns,\r\nand rifles, participated in the assaults, but the American artillery\r\nstopped the Japanese and their forces scattered. On 31 December,\r\nthe 77th Division began to relieve the elements of the 1st Cavalry\r\nDivision, which moved back to Kananga.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 30th of December, the 7th Cavalry had made\r\nphysical contact northeast of Villaba with the 127th Infantry, 32d\r\nDivision, which had been driving to the west coast north of the 1st\r\nCavalry Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 32d Division\r\n\r\nOn 22 December the 127th Infantry had reached Lonoy and made contact\r\nwith the 7th Cavalry. On the following day the troops rested. [1173]\r\nThe 128th Infantry had been engaged in sending out patrols throughout\r\nthe Limon area from 11 to 18 December. These patrols were successful\r\nin wiping out pockets of resistance that had been bypassed by the\r\nadvance forces of the 32d Division in the division's drive along\r\nHighway 2 to the south. On 20 December, the 128th received orders\r\nfrom General Gill to prepare for a move to the west coast. [1174]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Both the 127th and 128th Infantry Regiments sent out patrols on\r\n    23 December to reconnoiter the terrain. At 0800 on 24 December the\r\n    two regiments started for the west coast. Throughout the march to\r\n    the sea, they encountered only small parties of the enemy, who\r\n    put up no effective resistance, but heavy rains, dense, almost\r\n    impassable forests, and steep craggy hills slowed the advance.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe commanding officer of the 127th Infantry said of the hills\r\nencountered on 24 December:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The morning was spent in climbing to the top of a mountain\r\n    ridge. The climbing was difficult but as we later found out, the\r\n    descent was much worse. The trail led almost perpendicular down the\r\n    side. After reaching the bottom, another ridge was encountered,\r\n    this almost straight up, everyone had to use hand holds to pull\r\n    themselves up. All in all there were seven ridges from the bottom\r\n    of the first descent to the first possible bivouac area. [1175]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hills were less rugged from then on. On the morning of 25 December,\r\nthe 1st Battalion, 127th Infantry, encountered and dispersed 300 to\r\n400 Japanese. Throughout the march both regiments received supplies\r\nby airdrop, which was not completely satisfactory since none of the\r\ndrops was made at the requested time and frequently there was a wide\r\nscattering of supplies.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of 29 December the two regiments were on their\r\nobjectives: the 128th Infantry on the high ground overlooking Tabango\r\nand Campopo Bays and the 127th Infantry on the high ground overlooking\r\nAntipolo Point, approximately three miles to the south. Patrols were\r\nsent out to scout the terrain and establish contact with the 1st\r\nCavalry Division on the south and with the 24th Infantry Division on\r\nthe north. [1176]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 24th Infantry Division [1177]\r\n\r\nThe 24th Division, after having been relieved by the 32d Division on\r\nBreakneck Ridge, had protected the rear areas on a trail leading from\r\nJaro to Ormoc. Two weeks before the march to the west coast a large\r\nJapanese convoy had been attacked by U. S. aircraft and forced into\r\nSan Isidro Bay on the northern part of the west coast. Although the\r\nvessels were destroyed, some of the troops were able to get ashore. On\r\n9 December they headed toward Calubian, on Leyte Bay about six miles\r\nnortheast of San Isidro. General Woodruff, who had replaced General\r\nIrving on 18 November, ordered Colonel Clifford's 1st Battalion,\r\n34th Infantry, which had been defending Kilay Ridge, to wipe out\r\nthe part of the enemy force that had landed at San Isidro and fled\r\nnortheastward to the vicinity of Calubian.\r\n\r\nAt 2300 on 21 December, Colonel Clifford notified Colonel Dahlen,\r\nthe commanding officer of the 34th Infantry, that a Japanese force of\r\nabout 160 men was at Tuktuk, about four miles south of Calubian. He\r\nadded that at 0800 on the following morning the 1st Battalion would\r\nmove out and destroy the force.\r\n\r\nAt 0300 a force consisting of a platoon from Company C and a platoon\r\nfrom Company A moved toward the high ground northwest of Tuktuk in\r\npreparation for the assault, but because of very poor trails the\r\nforce was delayed. In the meantime four LVT's with a platoon of\r\nmortars moved overwater to Tuktuk. At 0830 the attack started, with\r\nmachine guns mounted on the LVT's and mortars furnishing supporting\r\nfire. The Japanese resistance was sporadic, although some mortar fire\r\nwas received. As the troops of the 34th Infantry neared the barrio,\r\nthe enemy defenders broke and fled, and the town was deserted as the\r\nsoldiers entered. Approximately thirty enemy dead were counted in the\r\nbarrio and vicinity. The fleeing enemy force was later destroyed by\r\npatrols that worked over the sector. The Japanese had obviously been\r\nlooting because linens, silverware, and women's clothing were found\r\nin their packs. One soldier had a baby's high chair tied on the top\r\nof his pack.\r\n\r\nOn 23 December, Col William W. Jenna, former commanding officer of\r\nthe 34th Infantry, returned from sick leave in the States and assumed\r\ncommand of the 34th Infantry. With his arrival plans were expedited\r\nto clean up the northwestern end of the Leyte peninsula in conjunction\r\nwith the assaults of other units of the Sixth Army.\r\n\r\nFrom 23 to 26 December, extensive patrolling was conducted along the\r\nwest coast of the Leyte peninsula. On 26 December the 34th Infantry\r\nissued orders for clearing the part of the Leyte peninsula in its\r\nzone. The 1st Battalion was to secure all trails and high ground in\r\nthe interior, prevent any enemy movement to the north and to the east,\r\nand, finally, be prepared to assist the 2d Battalion in the capture\r\nof the San Isidro Bay area.\r\n\r\nAt 2245 on 26 December the LCM's at Villalon (a barrio on Biliran\r\nStrait and about six miles northwest of Calubian) began to load\r\nCompanies F and G. By 2300 the embarkation was completed and the\r\ncraft moved to Gigantangan Island, arriving there fifteen minutes\r\nafter midnight. The troops disembarked and slept. At 0530 they again\r\nembarked and proceeded to Taglawigan, arriving there at 0730. After\r\nstrafing the shore the companies landed, meeting no resistance. At\r\nthe same time Company F completed its assignment without opposition,\r\npushing east and south and encircling Taglawigan. Before noon, some\r\nelements of the 2d Battalion were moving overland to Daha, about two\r\nmiles to the south, while others had re-embarked and were making an\r\noverwater movement toward it. By noon Taglawigan and Daha had fallen\r\nto the 2d Battalion.\r\n\r\nCompany G, reinforced, left Company F at Daha, re-embarked on the\r\nlanding craft, and headed toward the San Isidro Bay area, 6,000 yards\r\nto the south. As the convoy neared San Isidro, it came under machine\r\ngun fire from the barrio and the hills to the southwest. A frontal\r\nattack on the town was abandoned and the landing craft moved to the\r\nsouthwest of the jetty to make their landing. The LVT's mired in the\r\nmud about 100 to 150 yards offshore. The rest of the force, which\r\nwas in the LCM's, waded ashore. Some of the troops from the LVT's met\r\nwith great difficulty in trying to get ashore but the LVT's finally\r\nsucceeded in retracting and picked them up. Approximately 150 soldiers\r\nwith supplies for the task force returned to Gigantangan Island. The\r\nconvoy had only one casualty.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the 1st Battalion had received orders at 1300 to\r\ntake San Isidro. The battalion moved overland from Calubian and at\r\nnightfall it dug in on the high ground overlooking San Isidro.\r\n\r\nAt 0800 on 28 December, the co-ordinated assault was made against\r\nSan Isidro, with elements of the 2d Battalion attacking from the\r\nnorth while the 1st Battalion attacked from the east. The troops\r\nencountered light resistance, the Japanese defenders being only\r\npartially armed. Fifty-five of the enemy were killed and one prisoner\r\nwas taken. By 1230, the 1st Battalion was out-posting San Isidro.\r\n\r\nWith the capture of San Isidro, the last main point on the Leyte\r\npeninsula was safely in the hands of the 34th Infantry. The troops\r\nmoved south along the coast and destroyed small, poorly equipped groups\r\nof the enemy. One group of Japanese, whose only weapons were bayonets\r\nattached to bamboo poles, tried hopelessly to break through the lines.\r\n\r\nOn 1 January 1945, the 77th Division was ordered to relieve the\r\n32d and 24th Infantry Divisions and the 1st Cavalry Division. The\r\nrelieved divisions were to move to staging areas and prepare for\r\nfuture operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Retreat\r\n\r\nCondition of Japanese Forces\r\n\r\nThe morale and physical condition of the Japanese Army were very\r\nlow. With the juncture of the American X and XXIV Corps, the 35th\r\nArmy had begun to disintegrate. Desertion became common. The wounded\r\nwould not assemble with their units. The problem of the wounded\r\nbecame serious since there were no proper facilities for medical\r\ntreatment. General Tomochika later said: \"Commanders employing\r\npersuasive language frequently requested seriously wounded soldiers\r\nat the front to commit suicide; this was particularly common among\r\npersonnel of the 1st Division and it was pitiful. However the majority\r\ndied willingly. Only Japanese could have done a thing like this and\r\nyet I could not bear to see the sight.\" [1178]\r\n\r\nThose of the slightly wounded that could not march with the able-bodied\r\nsoldiers walked by themselves. They became separated from their units\r\nand some, although able to do so, refused to rejoin their outfits,\r\ngiving their wounds as an excuse. In addition there were deserters\r\nwho fled to the hills. The 35th Army began the policy of sending the\r\nslightly wounded back to the front lines. Many of the service units,\r\nsuch as the Mitsui Shipping Unit and the air corps ground crews,\r\nrefused to fight since they were not trained as combat troops. \"Even\r\nthe artillery and antiaircraft units retreated without facing the\r\nenemy. Their excuse was that they were not trained to fight as infantry\r\nand were useless without their guns.\" [1179]\r\n\r\nDoubtless, some of the unwillingness of the Japanese service troops to\r\nserve on the front lines was due to their physical condition. When the\r\n1st Division arrived on Leyte on 1 November it brought with it enough\r\nfood and ammunition for one month, and by 1 December this supply was\r\nexhausted. On 3 December an additional one-half month's supply was\r\nbrought in at Ormoc; but this was destroyed or captured by the 77th\r\nDivision in its advance. Consequently after the 1st of December all\r\nJapanese troops on Leyte \"were on a starvation diet and had to live\r\noff the land.\" [1180] The 1st and 57th Infantry Regiments were the\r\nprincipal sufferers. The men were forced to eat coconuts, various\r\ngrasses, bamboo shoots, the heart fibers of coconut tree trunks,\r\nand whatever native fruits or vegetables they could forage. When the\r\ntroops received orders to withdraw to the west coast of Leyte, \"they\r\nwere literally in a starved condition, ... many instances occurred\r\nin which men vomited seven to ten times a day because they could not\r\ndigest some of the food due to their weakened stomachs.\" [1181]\r\n\r\nThe 1st Division abandoned much equipment, ammunition, and rations\r\nalong the highway through the Ormoc Valley. Many of the stragglers and\r\ndeserters clothed and fed themselves with the abandoned matériel. The\r\nchief of staff of the 35th Army stated that when the Americans\r\ncaptured army headquarters, he left the headquarters without any\r\nclothing. However, he picked up \"a new uniform and sufficient food\r\nwhile on the road.\" [1182]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWithdrawal Plans\r\n\r\nOn 19 December, General Suzuki, the commander of the 35th Army\r\non Leyte, had received word from the 14th Area Army in Manila that\r\nhenceforth the 35th Army was to subsist on its own resources and what\r\nit could obtain within its operational area. [1183]\r\n\r\nOn the same day, probably because of the information received from\r\nManila, General Suzuki ordered a conference of the staff officers of\r\nthe 1st and 102d Divisions. At this meeting, General Suzuki ordered\r\nthe 1st Division to retreat to the northern sector of the Matagob area\r\nand the 102d Division to the southern part of the same sector. At\r\nMatagob the divisions were to reorganize for a counterattack. The\r\norder did not give any specific time for the withdrawal; each division\r\nwas to take action according to the situation in its sector. On 20\r\nDecember, General Suzuki moved his headquarters farther west to a\r\npoint approximately three and a half miles north of Palompon. [1184]\r\n\r\nOn 21 December, the 102d Division, which had about 2,000 men, began\r\nto withdraw to the vicinity of Matagob. The division, having failed to\r\nget in touch with the 35th Army, moved to the west coast near Villaba,\r\napproximately ten miles north of Palompon. [1185] It made contact\r\nwith the 1st Division at the end of December, and also with the 68th\r\nInfantry Brigade and the 5th Infantry Regiment, which were already\r\nin that sector. [1186] The 1st Division also began to withdraw on 21\r\nDecember, making the withdrawal in two columns. The southern column\r\nconsisted of about six hundred men of the 49th Infantry Regiment,\r\n1st Division Transport Regiment, and other units. On its way west,\r\nit was met on 23 December by the 68th Brigade which, unaware of\r\nthe loss of the Ormoc road, was proceeding toward the highway. The\r\nbrigade joined the southern column, which reached the Bagacay sector\r\nthe following day. (The barrio of Bagacay is six miles northeast\r\nof Villaba.) The northern column also had about six hundred men and\r\nconsisted of elements of the Division Headquarters, the 1st Infantry\r\nRegiment, the 57th Infantry Regiment, and other units. The detachment\r\nwas forced to cut its way through dense jungle. On 25 December it\r\nwas attacked by the Americans and further decimated. That night the\r\nnorthern and southern columns met at Bagacay and on the following day\r\nstarted towards Matagob. On the 28th, following orders from General\r\nSuzuki, they turned north and established defensive positions on the\r\neastern slope of Mt. Canguipot, two and a half miles southeast of\r\nVillaba. [1187]\r\n\r\nAs the Japanese, pursued by the forces of the X and XXIV Corps,\r\nspiritlessly retreated toward the mountains of western Leyte, Imperial\r\nGeneral Headquarters notified the Japanese people: \"Our forces are\r\nstill holding the Burauen and San Pablo airfields and continue to\r\nattack the enemy positions. Our forces are fighting fiercely on the\r\neastern mountain slopes near Ormoc and Albuera.\" [1188]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nLeyte Is Liberated\r\n\r\n\r\nOn 15 December, General MacArthur had directed General Eichelberger's\r\nEighth Army to be prepared to assume control of nearly all Sixth\r\nArmy units in the Leyte area at 0001 on 26 December 1944 in order to\r\nrelieve the Sixth Army for future operations. The Eighth Army was\r\nto relieve the Sixth of all duties and missions in the area except\r\ncertain ones dealing with logistics and construction. These were\r\nassigned to the USASOS (SWPA). The Allied Naval and Air Forces were\r\ndirected to continue, in support of the Eighth Army, the missions\r\nwhich hitherto had been specified for the Sixth. [1189]\r\n\r\nIn furtherance of General MacArthur's instructions, General Krueger\r\nissued orders covering the transfer to Eighth Army control of certain\r\nSixth Army units. On 21 December he named the units over which he\r\nwas relinquishing control as of 0001, 26 December, and stated that\r\nthe responsibility for continuing assigned duties and missions in\r\nthe area would then pass from him to the Commanding General, Eighth\r\nU. S. Army, the Commanding General, USASOS (SWPA), and the Commander,\r\nAllied Naval Forces. [1190]\r\n\r\nGeneral Eichelberger, also, prepared orders for the forthcoming\r\ntransfer of authority. The supply and evacuation procedures of\r\nthe Sixth Army would remain in effect. The X and XXIV Corps would\r\n\"continue on their present assigned missions of destroying Japanese\r\nwherever found, and ... be prepared to conduct overland or amphibious\r\nshore to shore operations to seize enemy supply points and bases,\r\nand ports of entry.\" [1191]\r\n\r\nOn 25 December, when elements of the 77th Division had seized Palompon,\r\nthe last important port on Leyte, General MacArthur declared that\r\nall organized resistance had ended. He said in a message to General\r\nKrueger: \"Heartiest congratulations on capture of Palompon. This closes\r\na campaign that has had few counterparts in the utter destruction\r\nof the enemy's forces with a maximum conservation of our own. It has\r\nbeen a magnificent performance on the part of all concerned.\" [1192]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Eighth Army Assumes Control\r\n\r\nOn 26 December, General Eichelberger assumed control of all combat\r\nunits in the Leyte-Samar area. It was not until the first part of\r\nJanuary 1945 that the American troops secured the west coast of\r\nLeyte. Thereafter only isolated pockets of enemy resistance remained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssembly of Japanese Forces\r\n\r\nOn 25 December 1944, General Yamashita, commanding the 14th Area Army,\r\nnotified General Suzuki, the 35th Army commander, that he had written\r\noff the Leyte Campaign as a loss; henceforward the 35th Army on Leyte\r\nwould be self-sustaining and self-supporting, the units on Leyte\r\nwould be transferred to other areas, and, finally, the units on the\r\nisland would be assembled at a point from which raiding operations\r\ncould be conducted. Since these orders were ambiguous and apparently\r\ncontradictory, General Suzuki asked that the message be repeated but he\r\nnever received an answer. Accordingly, in the latter part of December,\r\nhe sent his chief of staff to Manila for further clarification of\r\nthe orders. The chief of staff arrived at Manila, by way of Cebu,\r\nin late January, but he was unable to obtain any further information\r\nfor General Suzuki.\r\n\r\nThe decision of General Yamashita to abandon the Leyte operation\r\nfollowed a series of rapidly moving events. On the 14th of December,\r\nhe canceled an optimistic plan for an amphibious assault through\r\nthe shallow waters of Carigara Bay against Carigara, an assault that\r\nhad been scheduled for 16 December. This cancellation followed the\r\nsighting of an Allied convoy en route to Mindoro. [1193] The convoy\r\nreached Mindoro and the troops landed successfully on 15 December. On\r\n19 December, two days prior to the junction of the X and XXIV Corps\r\non Highway 2, General Yamashita told General Suzuki that he could no\r\nlonger send any reinforcements and supplies to Leyte and that the\r\n35th Army would have to become self-supporting. On the same day,\r\nGeneral Yamashita assigned to the defense of Luzon three divisions\r\nthat Imperial General Headquarters had earmarked for Leyte. Shortly\r\nafterward, at a conference with representatives from the Southern\r\nArmy and Imperial General Headquarters, the representative from the\r\nlatter told General Yamashita to forget the Leyte operation.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, General Suzuki interpreted his orders to mean that\r\nunits of the 35th Army would assemble at a common point at which\r\nthey could be self-supporting. He had selected the western area of\r\nMatagob-Palompon in the vicinity of the road leading from Highway 2\r\nat Libongao over the mountains to Palompon on the west coast. Palompon\r\nwas to have been used as the rear center of the line of communications\r\nand the army headquarters was to have been established at Kompisao,\r\nbut the seizure of Palompon on 25 December by the 77th Division\r\nforced Suzuki to change the location of his army headquarters. [1194]\r\nHe then selected as a base of operations an area in the vicinity of\r\nGinabuyan that overlooked Silad Bay and was about three kilometers\r\nnorth of Villaba.\r\n\r\nThe new area was a plateau with an elevation of about 1,200 feet,\r\nheavily forested and having rocky eastern and western slopes that made\r\nit \"a natural fortress.\" From it one could command a view of Ormoc\r\nValley to the east and the Camotes Sea and Cebu to the west. There\r\nwere a few Filipino huts, and cultivated fields and coconut groves,\r\ninterspersed with salt beds, lay along the beach. The area \"was\r\nadmirably suited for an extended period of defensive action.\" [1195]\r\nGeneral Suzuki ordered the units of the 35th Army that were retreating\r\nwestward to repair to the vicinity of the new base of operations.\r\n\r\nThe units continued to straggle westward towards the selected area. By\r\n1 January, most of them had taken up positions in the Balanac sector,\r\nwhich was about three and a half miles southeast of Villaba and\r\noverlooked the Palompon road. They had been hard pressed. The 68th\r\nBrigade and the 1st Division made contact and successfully concentrated\r\nsouth of Villaba in early January. The 12th Independent Regiment (the\r\nImahori Detachment), the Mitsui Shipping Unit, the 4th Airborne Raiding\r\nRegiment and the remaining troops of the 77th Infantry Regiment, which\r\nhad been operating northeast of Ormoc, reached the southern Matagob\r\narea about the middle of January. It was not until the beginning of\r\nFebruary that these units made contact with the 35th Army. The few\r\nremaining elements of the 16th Division stayed in the vicinity of\r\nValencia until the end of February. The 26th Division also remained\r\nin this area until the middle of January, when it moved west and\r\nestablished contact with the 35th Army. [1196]\r\n\r\nThe 102d Division presented certain difficulties. There had been\r\ninstances of forty to fifty deserters fleeing to Cebu or Negros on\r\nboats they had built for themselves. Deserters that were apprehended\r\nwere court-martialed. General Suzuki for some time had been out\r\nof touch with Lt. Gen. Shimpei Fukue, the commanding general of\r\nthe 102d Division, which was in the Mt. Pina area. By chance, one\r\nof Suzuki's officers learned that Fukue was planning to evacuate\r\nto Cebu. General Suzuki was incensed since he and his staff felt\r\nthat Fukue \"was violating the military code in taking these steps\r\nwithout consent.\" He thereupon sent the following message to Fukue:\r\n\"Lt. General Fukue and his headquarters will remain in Leyte and at\r\nthe same time I am attaching other units and groups in the Visayan\r\nand Mindanao sectors to your Division. General Fukue and his Chief of\r\nStaff will report to me in person at Army Headquarters.\" The commander\r\nof the 102d Division did not answer but his chief of staff sent the\r\nfollowing reply: \"We appreciate the efforts of Army but at the present\r\ntime we are very busy preparing for retreat. The division commander\r\nand chief of staff are unable to report to Army Headquarters.\" [1197]\r\n\r\nGeneral Suzuki was \"entirely displeased\" with the reaction of Fukue\r\nand sent his chief of staff, General Tomochika, to investigate the\r\nsituation. When Tomochika arrived he found that Fukue, with his\r\nchief of staff and some headquarters personnel, had already left for\r\nCebu. This fact was communicated to General Suzuki by Tomochika, who\r\nstates that \"for several days I had a difficult time in consoling the\r\ngeneral.\" [1198] The sequel to these events was that General Suzuki\r\nrelieved General Fukue of his command and ordered him to remain on\r\nCebu until he received further orders. Upon the arrival of Suzuki\r\nin Cebu in the spring of 1945, Fukue was sentenced to confinement\r\nfor thirty days. General Suzuki asked Imperial General Headquarters\r\nin Tokyo for authority to court-martial General Fukue; no reply was\r\nforthcoming. General Fukue was released and later returned to command\r\nof the 102d Division. [1199]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the leaderless 102d Division, with a strength of\r\napproximately 2,000 men, crossed Highway 2 north of Libongao and\r\nreached the southern area of Matagob about 24 December. The troops\r\nfailed to contact the 35th Army and after remaining for a short time\r\nat Matagob moved to the vicinity of Villaba.\r\n\r\nThe units that arrived on the west coast were much understrength\r\nand very poorly equipped. All artillery had been lost. There were\r\nonly five to ten machine guns per regiment in addition to individual\r\nweapons. Each man had an average of sixty rounds of ammunition and\r\nseveral hand grenades.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of December, General Yamashita sent the following message\r\nto General Suzuki:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Sixty days have already elapsed since the American forces invaded\r\n    Leyte Island, during which period the Thirty-fifth Army, under\r\n    the forceful leadership of its commander, has waged many a heroic\r\n    battle against superior enemy forces and in the face of numerous\r\n    difficulties. The Army gave a great blow to the enemy. Moreover,\r\n    the Thirty-fifth Army by containing the opposing enemy for this\r\n    long period of time deprived him of freedom of action for the\r\n    coming operation, thereby facilitating the general conduct of\r\n    our operations in this battle and rendering great services to our\r\n    cause. I am deeply impressed, particularly with the fact that the\r\n    Takachiho Unit captured the hostile airfield at BURAUEN after the\r\n    Thirty-fifth Army, despite its inferiority in equipment and number\r\n    of men, and the stoppage of supply, made a timely and resolute\r\n    attack against the enemy with the commander himself leading\r\n    them. However, the enemy, who has increased his material power\r\n    and war potential, now threatens, solely on the strength of his\r\n    material superiority, to bear down on Luzon Island despite the\r\n    heroic and desperate efforts of our sea and air forces as well\r\n    as of the Thirty-fifth Army. In view of the sudden change in the\r\n    situation, we shall seek and destroy our enemy on Luzon Island,\r\n    thereby doing our part in the heroic struggle of the Army and\r\n    avenging many a valiant warrior who fell before the enemy. As\r\n    munitions have not been supplied adequately, I cannot keep back\r\n    tears of remorse for tens of thousands of our officers and men\r\n    fighting in Leyte Island. Nevertheless, I must impose a still\r\n    harder task upon you. Please try to understand my intentions. They\r\n    say it is harder to live than to die. You officers and men, be\r\n    patient enough to endure the hardships of life, and help guard and\r\n    maintain the prosperity of the Imperial Throne through eternal\r\n    resistance to the enemy, and be ready to meet your death calmly\r\n    for our beloved country. I sincerely instruct you as above. [1200]\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Suzuki took steps to make the force on Leyte\r\nself-supporting. In January 1945, he established two principles for\r\nhis troops. First, the troops were to utilize as much of the local\r\nfood and material as possible and plant sweet potatoes and Indian\r\ncorn. Second, all provisions in the area outside of the operation\r\nbase were to be purchased. The execution of the first part of his\r\nfirst precept worked reasonably well but the constant American air\r\nraids and mopping-up operations prevented the Japanese from being too\r\nsuccessful in planting and harvesting the corn and potatoes. They were\r\nalso not very fortunate in purchasing supplies from outside the area,\r\nalthough some supplies were obtained each time the men could pass\r\nthrough the American protective screen.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese arrived on the western shores of Leyte at the end of\r\nthe harvest season. They secured large quantities of provisions\r\nwhich the Filipinos had stored and also a great number of coconuts\r\nand sweet potatoes. The soldiers used the carabaos of the island as\r\nmeat and obtained salt from sea water. For vegetables, the army's\r\nchief reliance was upon wild ferns, tokay grass, and wild spinach.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, \"although there was not enough food to increase the\r\nfighting power of the Army, no one died of starvation and some units\r\nstored enough supplies for two to three months.\" [1201]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mop-up\r\n\r\nBy the end of December, most of the enemy troops were in northwest\r\nLeyte, west of Highway 2 and north of Palompon. Another large enemy\r\nconcentration was located in the hills south of Palompon. [1202]\r\n\r\nThe mop-up of any operation is dangerous, difficult, and unglamorous,\r\nbut it is highly essential. The activities of the 7th Division on Leyte\r\nduring January and February 1945 are typical of the large-scale mop-up\r\nin which many small units are sent out daily in all directions. This\r\ndivision was assigned all of the west coast area south of a line from\r\nPalompon to Valencia. Its records state that the division \"sent out as\r\nmany as forty combat patrols daily to hunt down and destroy thousands\r\nof Japanese stragglers wandering throughout the area.\" [1203]\r\n\r\nEight divisions were engaged in mopping up for varying lengths of time\r\non Leyte, but only an outline of their activities will be attempted\r\nhere. The operation may be divided into three phases: XXIV Corps\r\nactivities from 1 January to 15 February 1945; X Corps activities\r\nfrom 1 January to 24 February 1945; and Eighth Army Area Command\r\noperations from 24 February to 8 May 1945. [1204]\r\n\r\nDuring the XXIV Corps phase, the 11th Airborne Division encountered an\r\nenemy force well dug in on the southern slopes of Mt. Majunag, five\r\nmiles northwest of Burauen. After much bitter hand-to-hand fighting\r\nthe Japanese were destroyed. The 96th Division engaged in extensive\r\npatrolling, relieved the 11th Airborne Division, and relieved the\r\nX Corps of all tactical responsibility east of the mountains. The\r\n7th Division sent out numerous patrols in the southern part of the\r\nisland, and sent out a reinforced battalion that destroyed all enemy\r\nforces in the Camotes Islands. The 77th Division, which operated\r\nin the northwestern part of the island, cleared up many pockets of\r\nenemy resistance.\r\n\r\nIn the X Corps phase, the island of Samar was cleared of Japanese\r\ntroops. The Americal Division, advance elements of which arrived on\r\n24 January, extensively patrolled both the islands of Leyte and Samar.\r\n\r\nDuring the Eighth Army Area Command phase, the constant searching\r\nout of isolated groups of enemy soldiers continued. In addition to\r\nthe Americal Division, the 1st Filipino Infantry Regiment patrolled\r\nLeyte. On 8 May, the control of the Eighth Army over the area came\r\nto an end. [1205]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Withdrawal\r\n\r\nAt the time that General Suzuki made his plans for the units of\r\nthe 35th Army on Leyte to become self-sufficient, he felt that\r\nthere were too many soldiers on the island to make the plan fully\r\neffective. General Suzuki decided therefore to transfer to other\r\nislands those who, because of their good physical condition and morale,\r\nwould be able to withstand the rigors of a long fight. Consequently\r\nthe sick, weak, and wounded were dropped from the units that were to\r\nbe withdrawn. [1206] General Suzuki also considered the selection of\r\nthe location of the new headquarters for the 35th Army. Since there\r\nwere 15,000 Japanese residents in and around Davao on Mindanao, it\r\nwas finally decided to remove the army headquarters to Davao. As a\r\npreliminary step, the 1st Division was to be sent to Cebu. [1207]\r\n\r\nGeneral Suzuki had plans drawn up showing the order of precedence\r\nby which the units on Leyte were to be withdrawn and their\r\ndestinations. All available landing barges on Leyte and additional\r\nvessels from Cebu and other areas would be used. The order of the\r\nproposed withdrawal and the destinations of the units were as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    1st Division                          northern Cebu and later to\r\n                                          Negros\r\n    41st and 77th Infantry Regiments      Mindanao\r\n    102d Division                         Visayan area\r\n    26th Division                         Bacolod sector of Negros\r\n    Takahashi Detachment                  northern Cebu\r\n    Units of the 68th Independent Mixed\r\n    Brigade                               northern Cebu\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Suzuki and 35th Army Headquarters would leave Leyte about\r\nthe same time as the 26th Division. The 16th Division, the 68th\r\nIndependent Mixed Brigade, and other small units were to remain on\r\nLeyte and would be under the command of Lt. Gen. Shiro Makino, the\r\n16th Division commander. [1208]\r\n\r\nWhen these plans were announced Lt. Gen. Tadasu Kataoka, the\r\ncommanding general of the 1st Division, suggested that as the 1st\r\nDivision had lost so many men and officers in the Leyte operation\r\nit might be better to use the 68th Independent Mixed Brigade, which\r\nhad fresh troops and would be better suited for the assignment to\r\nCebu. He was overruled. [1209] There were, however, other officers\r\nwho were more anxious to leave Leyte. General Tomochika later wrote:\r\n\"Many of the troops rushed to join this movement and Staff Officer\r\nNakamura experienced difficulty in controlling them. However, quite\r\na number of men succeeded in transferring without the commander's\r\norders. The commander was displeased because only a small number of\r\nstaff officers were willing to stay on Leyte.\" [1210]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of 12 January, four launches arrived at Abijao to begin\r\nevacuation of the 1st Division. The Americans attacked and damaged\r\nthe vessels, but three were repaired. By 2300, with the embarkation\r\nof the first party, composed of elements of the 49th Infantry and\r\nDivision Headquarters, the evacuation got under way. This group left\r\nAbijao at 0130 on 13 January and reached Tabogon, in northern Cebu,\r\nabout 0730. At about the same time, the remnants of the 57th Infantry\r\nreached Cebu. The rest of 1st Division Headquarters, the 1st Infantry\r\nRegiment, and part of the 1st Transport Regiment left Leyte on the\r\n18th, and on the 20th the rest of the 49th Infantry Regiment and the\r\n1st Division Transport quitted the island.\r\n\r\nBetween the 13th and 20th of January the three launches, each carrying\r\nabout seventy men, made four round trips. After the second trip,\r\nthe Americans spotted the operation. The hiding place of the craft at\r\nTabogon was frequently strafed by aircraft and shelled by submarines\r\nand motor torpedo boats, which kept the channel waters under sharp\r\nsurveillance. On the night of the 20th, American aircraft sank three\r\nlaunches. Although additional craft were sent up from Liloan on Cebu,\r\nthese were also sunk. It was impossible to evacuate any more personnel\r\nuntil the middle of March. [1211]\r\n\r\nThe number of men from the 1st Division evacuated to Cebu was estimated\r\nto be as follows: 1st Division Headquarters, 73; 1st Infantry Regiment,\r\n72; 49th Infantry Regiment, 208; 57th Infantry Regiment, 178; and 1st\r\nTransport Regiment, 212; a total of 743 men. The equipment evacuated\r\nincluded 332 rifles, 4 heavy machine guns, 11 light machine guns, 5\r\ngrenade launchers, and a small amount of small arms ammunition. [1212]\r\nIn addition several hundred men obtained their own transportation\r\nand left for other islands in the Philippines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Road Ends\r\n\r\nFrom 20 January on, the remaining Japanese forces stayed in the Villaba\r\nsector, hoping that succor would come. On 20 January General Tomochika\r\n\"waited on the beach\" for a boat that never came. The men were \"plunged\r\ninto the depths of despair.\" Time passed. On the evening of 17 March,\r\ntwo Japanese vessels appeared. General Suzuki and part of his staff\r\nboarded the craft and at 0030, 18 March, left the island of Leyte,\r\nFor days the vessels sailed from island to island in the Visayas\r\nonly to find that they were too late. The Americans were already in\r\npossession. On the evening of 16 April, the vessel bearing General\r\nSuzuki was bombed by American aircraft off the coast of Negros Island\r\nand Suzuki was killed [1213] The Leyte Campaign had ended.\r\n\r\nThe liberation of Leyte had been accomplished at no slight cost. During\r\nthe peak month, January 1945, there were 257,766 American Army,\r\nincluding Air Forces, troops on Leyte. [1214] The total Army casualties\r\nfor the Leyte Campaign were over 15,500, including more than 3,500\r\nkilled and nearly 12,000 wounded. (Tables 4 and 5)\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, with data now available to determine with any degree\r\nof exactitude the number of Japanese who participated in the campaign\r\nor their casualties. The estimates of the Sixth and Eighth Armies\r\nvary greatly, as do those of the various Japanese sources. The Sixth\r\nArmy estimated that it had killed 56,263 and captured 389 men. [1215]\r\nand that as of 26 December 1944 when it relinquished control to Eighth\r\nArmy about 5,000 of the Japanese remained on the islands of Leyte and\r\nSamar. [1216] The Eighth Army estimated that, for the mop-up period\r\nfrom 26 December 1944 to 8 May 1945, it killed and found dead 24,294\r\nand captured 439 Japanese. [1217] General Eichelberger stated that\r\nhis forces killed \"more than twenty-seven thousand Japanese.\" [1218]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 4--U. S.

S. Army,\r\nInclosure 1, and Sixth U. S. Army, on the Leyte-Samar Operation,\r\np. 155.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Japanese historians of the Leyte operation estimate that the total\r\nstrength of their army ground troops was 70,000 men. [1220] General\r\nTomochika, the chief of staff of the 35th Army, was interrogated\r\nseveral times after the war. On one occasion he estimated that the\r\ntotal number of Japanese involved in the Leyte operation, including\r\nnaval and air personnel and those who lost their lives in transports\r\nsunk en route to Leyte, was 59,400 men, approximately one fifth of all\r\nJapanese forces in the Philippine Islands. [1221] On another occasion\r\nGeneral Tomochika estimated that 61,800 Japanese had been on Leyte,\r\nand that 13,010 were alive and 48,790 had been killed by 17 March\r\n1945. [1222]\r\n\r\nIn the plan for the defeat of Japan the objective sought in\r\nreconquering the Philippines was not only to liberate the Filipinos\r\nbut also to cut off the Japanese from the rich empire that they had\r\nacquired in the Netherlands Indies, and at the same time to establish\r\na base for the final assault on the enemy's homeland. As early as 1942\r\nAllied submarines had begun to gnaw at the lifeline between Japan and\r\nits new empire, rich in rubber, tin, rice, and, above all, in oil,\r\nwithout which Japan could not remain in the war. By the fall of 1944\r\nthe submarines had virtually cut this lifeline, which ran past the\r\nPhilippines. The loss of the Philippines to the Allies would finally\r\nsever it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 5--Sixth Army Battle Casualties by Arm or Service, 20 October-25\r\nDecember 1944\r\n\r\n----------------+------+------+-------------+-------------+-------------\r\n                |    Killed   |  Wounded and|   Missing   |    Total\r\n                |             |    Injured  |  in Action  |\r\nArm or Service  +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n                |Number| Per  |Number| Per  |Number| Per  |Number| Per\r\n                |      | Cent |      | Cent |      | Cent |      | Cent\r\n----------------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\nInfantry        | 2,380| 82.42| 7,749| 78.61|   85 | 52.80|10,214| 79.14\r\nEngineer        |   132|  4.58|   762|  7.73|   46 | 28.57|   940|  7.28\r\nMedical         |   100|  3.47|   375|  3.80|    8 |  4.97|   483|  3.74\r\nField Artillery |    96|  3.33|   328|  3.33|    5 |  3.11|   429|  3.32\r\nCoast Artillery |    47|  1.59|   248|  2.52|    1 |   .62|   296|  2.30\r\nOrdnance        |    45|  1.56|   100|  1.01|    1 |   .62|   146|  1.13\r\nQuartermaster   |    41|  1.42|    67|   .68|    9 |  5.59|   117|   .91\r\nSignal          |    12|   .42|    76|   .77|    0 |   .00|    88|   .68\r\nTransportation  |     7|   .24|    73|   .74|    1 |   .62|    81|   .63\r\nChemical Warfare|    13|   .45|    44|   .45|    0 |   .00|    57|   .44\r\nMilitary Police |    13|   .45|    27|   .27|    4 |  2.48|    44|   .34\r\nChaplain        |     0|   .00|     0|   .00|    0 |   .00|     0|   .00\r\nMiscellaneous   |     2|   .07|     9|   .09|    1 |   .62|    12|   .09\r\n                +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n      Total     | 2,888|100.00| 9,858|100.00|  161 |100.00|12,907|100.00\r\n----------------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n\r\nSource: Sixth Army Operations Report Leyte, 20 October-25 December\r\n1944, p. 155.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of the Leyte Campaign had been to force an entry into\r\nthe Philippines and establish a solid base for their reconquest. It\r\nhad accomplished this object, though the base had not been secured\r\nand developed as promptly or as effectively as the planners had\r\nanticipated. The construction program on the island had been\r\na disappointment. Leyte never became a major air base. But the\r\ncampaign had other and more important effects that had not been\r\nforeseen when it was launched. In their determination to make Leyte\r\nthe decisive battle of the Philippines, the Japanese had committed\r\nthe major portions of their fleet and air force in a vain attempt to\r\nstay the American advance. In the Battle of Leyte Gulf the Japanese\r\nNavy suffered irreparable damage--all of the carriers were lost and\r\nmost of the capital ships were sunk or damaged. The air force was now\r\nalmost completely dependent upon the suicidal kamikaze pilot. Finally,\r\nthe dispatch of reinforcements and supplies to Leyte had seriously\r\ncrippled the defenses of Luzon--the strategic heart of the Philippine\r\nArchipelago.\r\n\r\nThe Americans had established an air base in the midst of the\r\nJapanese-held Philippine Islands--a base within medium bomber range\r\nof Luzon, the principal American target in the archipelago. [1223]\r\nAs General Yamashita, commanding officer of all Japanese Army troops\r\nin the Philippines later said: \"After the loss of Leyte ... I realized\r\nthat decisive battle was impossible....\" [1224]\r\n\r\nThree years of hard fighting over jungle trails had finally brought\r\nthe U. S. forces back to the Philippines. Ahead lay months of weary\r\nstruggle but ultimate victory was no longer in doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A\r\n\r\n\r\nGHQ Operations Instructions Number 70, 21 September 1944\r\n\r\nGENERAL HEADQUARTERS\r\n\r\nSOUTHWEST PACIFIC AREA\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

Forces records,\r\nU.S. Army records, U.S. Marine Corps records, U.S. Navy records,\r\nguerrilla records, Japanese studies, interviews, manuscript histories,\r\nspecial studies, and published works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoint Chiefs of Staff Records\r\n\r\nThe official records of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as well as those of\r\nthe Combined Chiefs of Staff, are now in the custody of the Research\r\nAnalysis Section, Joint Chiefs of Staff. They consist primarily of\r\nthe formal papers and minutes of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. An almost\r\ncomplete file of these JCS and CCS papers and minutes was kept for\r\nthe Army during the wartime period by the Operations Division of the\r\nWar Department General Staff and is now in the possession of the G-3\r\nDivision, the successor to the Operations Division. This Army file\r\ncontains plans for projected operations, the working papers of the Army\r\nplanning personnel, and correspondence with officers in the Pacific\r\ntheaters, as well as the copies of the JCS and CCS minutes and papers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArmy Air Forces Records\r\n\r\nThe archives of the United States Army Air Forces contain manuscript\r\nhistories of the various units and commands, written during or shortly\r\nafter the war. The quality of these varies considerably. The following\r\nhistories are of especial value for a study of the Leyte Campaign:\r\nthose of the 7th, 8th, and 9th Fighter Squadrons of the 49th Fighter\r\nGroup, 86th Fighter Wing, V Fighter Command, Fifth Air Force; V Fighter\r\nCommand; V Bomber Command; XIII Bomber Command; Fifth Air Force;\r\nThirteenth Air Force; and Far East Air Forces. Two studies are also\r\nuseful: Far East Air Forces Staff Study Operation KING II, 12 July\r\n44; and Fifth Air Force Fighter Cover Plan for Ormoc Bay Operation,\r\nfile 731.326.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArmy Records\r\n\r\nThe voluminous Army records on the Leyte Campaign vary considerably\r\nin quality and content. The documents range from messages between\r\nthe Chief of Staff and theater commanders to company journals.\r\n\r\nThe Chief of Staff's Log, 1944, which is in the Staff Communications\r\nOffice, Office of the Chief of Staff, contains the daily high level\r\nradiograms and telephonic communications between Washington and\r\nthe theaters. These give a concise daily summary of the strategic\r\nsituation throughout the world, shed considerable light on joint and\r\ncombined command, and summarize important plans and decisions.\r\n\r\nMost of the records of General MacArthur's headquarters are in\r\nJapan. Available in the Historical Records Section of the Adjutant\r\nGeneral's Office is a nearly complete file of the G-3 journals\r\nfor the entire war period. The \"Top Secret\" messages are not\r\nincluded. In addition there is a nearly complete file of Allied\r\nTranslator Interpreter Section, GHQ SWPA, \"Current Translations\" and\r\n\"Enemy Publications.\" The Allied Geographical Section, GHQ SWPA,\r\nmade terrain studies of the geographical regions in the Southwest\r\nPacific Area. Although they contain errors three of these were of\r\nvalue--Special Report 55, Airfields, Landing Beaches and Roads,\r\nSamar, Leyte and Dinagat Group, 10 July 1944; Terrain Study 84,\r\nLeyte Province, 17 August 1944; and Terrain Handbook 34, Tacloban,\r\n25 September 1944. The Military Intelligence Section prepared\r\ninformation bulletins on the guerrillas that were of some use. These\r\nare: The Resistance Movement on Leyte Island, 7 October 1944, and\r\nThe Resistance Movement on Samar Island, 10 October 1944.\r\n\r\nThe records of the Sixth Army for the campaign are very complete and\r\nin excellent condition. In addition to a fine operations report, there\r\nare complete G-2, G-3, and G-4 journals. These journals contain the\r\ndaily messages, reports, and memoranda exchanged between Sixth Army,\r\nGeneral Headquarters, responsible naval commanders, and subordinate\r\nunits of the Sixth Army, as well as planning papers, periodic reports\r\nof Sixth Army and subordinate units, field and administrative orders,\r\ninterrogations, and estimates of the enemy situation. For the period\r\nafter 26 December 1944 the operations report of the Eighth Army\r\nis useful.\r\n\r\nThe operations report of the X Corps is helpful but too brief. The\r\njournals (G-2, G-3, and G-4) of the corps, however, are good. The XXIV\r\nCorps prepared an inadequate and incomplete operations report and its\r\njournals as a whole are inferior to those of the X Corps. The sections\r\nand sub-sections of the headquarters of the XXIV Corps completed\r\n\"histories.\" These consist mainly of photographs of individuals and\r\nnotations of changes in personnel. The \"history\" of the Sixth Army\r\nService Command is poor and there are few records of ASCOM in the\r\nHistorical Records Section, Adjutant General's Office.\r\n\r\nThe records of the 1st Cavalry Division and subordinate units are\r\ngenerally adequate, although those of the two brigades are inferior\r\nto those of the division and of the regiments. The narrative of the\r\noperations report of the 7th Division is inferior but the appendixes\r\nare excellent and very complete; the journals of the division are\r\ngood. In general the operations reports and journals of the infantry\r\nregiments are very helpful. The operations report of the 32d Infantry\r\nis excellent and a model for a perfect regimental operations report. In\r\ncontrast, the operations reports and journals of the 11th Airborne\r\nDivision and subordinate units are very poor and incomplete. The 24th\r\nInfantry Division prepared a superb operations report and kept good\r\njournals. The records of the regiments of the division are sparse\r\nand incomplete and their operations reports are either inadequate or\r\nnonexistent. The records and operations reports of the 32d Division\r\nand its regiments are extremely sketchy and inexact. The 38th Division\r\nused Leyte as a staging area; when the Japanese parachuted into the\r\nBurauen airfields, its 149th Infantry was committed. The operations\r\nreport of that regiment for the resultant action is far too brief. The\r\n77th Infantry Division and its regiments have very good operations\r\nreports but their journals are inadequate. The operations reports and\r\njournals of the 96th Division are good. The journals and operations\r\nreports of the Americal Division are only fairly good. There are\r\n\"histories\" and operations reports of small independent or attached\r\nunits, but these are frequently one to three pages in length and very\r\nincomplete. Finally, it should be noted that the operations reports\r\nof the various artillery units are in the main poor and incomplete\r\nand the journals are highly technical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarine Records\r\n\r\nSpecial Action Report of Corps Artillery, V Amphibious Corps, 28\r\nDecember 1944.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNavy Records\r\n\r\nThe naval records that were consulted include the operation plans and\r\nreports by naval commanders. Copies of most of these are among the\r\nrecords of the Historical Records Section, Adjutant General's Office,\r\nDepartment of the Army. All of the documents are in the files of the\r\nOffice of the Naval Records and Library, Department of the Navy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuerrilla Records\r\n\r\nThere is in the Office of the Chief of Military History a large,\r\ncompletely disorganized collection of heterogeneous materials by and\r\nabout the guerrillas in the Philippine Islands. These are incomplete,\r\ninadequate, and controversial. Some of the guerrilla bands had no\r\nrecords and all that is known of others is from violently prejudiced\r\nsources. Some of the American guerrillas published books on their\r\nexperiences. These are impressionistic, generally replete with\r\nderring-do, and consequently possess scant value as sources. The\r\nCombat History Division, G-1 Section, AFWESPAC, prepared a four-volume\r\nwork--\"Triumph in the Philippines,\" the third volume of which, entitled\r\n\"Guerrillas: Enemy Occupation,\" is colorful, but poor history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJapanese Studies\r\n\r\nAt the cessation of hostilities, General MacArthur ordered the former\r\nJapanese War and Navy Ministries to prepare studies on Japanese plans\r\nand operations in World War II. The resulting studies, translations and\r\noriginals, of which those mentioned below deal with the Leyte Campaign,\r\nare on file with the Office of the Chief of Military History. Although\r\nthere are errors in dates, designations of units, and frequently in\r\nfacts, these are the best sources for information on Japanese plans\r\nand operations. An exception is the independent study by General\r\nTomochika, which despite its garish title is very good and contains\r\nmuch human interest. Tomochika, evidently a man of strong prejudices,\r\nat times was unduly critical of some of his fellow officers. Japanese\r\nStudies used in this volume are:\r\n\r\nTomochika, Maj. Gen. Yoshiharu, The True Facts of the Leyte Operation,\r\ntypescript of translation, 10th I&HS, Eighth Army, 3 December 1946\r\n\r\nJapanese Studies in World War II, 5, 4th Air Army Operations, 1914-45\r\n\r\n----, 7, 14th Army Operations on Leyte\r\n\r\n----, 11, 35th Army Operations, 1944-45\r\n\r\n----, 14, Naval Operations in the Philippine Area, 1942-45\r\n\r\n----, 21, History of the Southern Army, 1941-45\r\n\r\n----, 72, History of the Army Section, Imperial General Headquarters,\r\n1941-45\r\n\r\n----, 102, Philippine Area Naval Operations, October 1944-December\r\n1944, Part II, The Battle of Leyte Gulf\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviews\r\n\r\nThe following U.S. Army officers furnished the author valuable\r\ninformation on the Leyte Campaign: Lt.

Roger Pineau of the\r\nU.S. Navy were very co-operative, helping to clear up moot points\r\nthat arose. Capt. Samuel E. Morison furnished information on the\r\nPearl Harbor Conference of July 1944.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nManuscript Histories\r\n\r\nThere are in the files of the Office, Chief of Military History,\r\nthe following manuscript histories of certain phases of the campaign:\r\n\r\nDean, Captain Tucker--The Liberation of Leyte.

A full\r\ndiscussion of the \"greatest naval battle of the Second World War\r\nand the largest engagement ever fought on the high seas\" would\r\nrequire a volume. Such a study is being prepared by Samuel Eliot\r\nMorison in his series of studies on the U.S. Navy's part in the\r\nwar. Two excellent accounts--James Field's The Japanese at Leyte\r\nGulf, and C. Vann Woodward's The Battle for Leyte Gulf (New York,\r\n1947)--have already appeared.

The division commander, Lt. Gen. Kataoka worried\r\nabout the loss of his troops, lacked brave command ability and did\r\nnot establish any set battle policy. [He refused to commit one of\r\nhis important units to the defense of Highway 2.] ... therefore\r\nthe Chief of Staff, Deputy Chief of Staff and senior staff officers\r\nwere dispatched from Army to Division on three different occasions\r\nto urge General Kataoka to submit to these orders.... Regardless of\r\nhow much we urged General Kataoka to change his views he would not\r\nbudge. Colonel Ikeda, the Chief of Staff of the 1st Division [until\r\n13 December] was partially deaf and further because of a former lung\r\nailment, he was unsuited to hold his important position. (Tomochika,\r\nTrue Facts of Leyte Opn, p. 18.)\r\n\r\nGeneral Tomochika was less than fair to the 1st Division. From its\r\npositions in the mountains of northern Leyte, the division contested\r\nevery foot of advance of the X Corps. General Krueger said of the\r\n1st Division: \"This unit more than any other hostile unit on Leyte\r\nwas responsible for the extension of the Leyte Operation.\" (Sixth\r\nArmy Opns Rpt Leyte, p. 41.)\r\n\r\n[1082] Sixth Army FO 36, 4 Dec 44.\r\n\r\n[1083] During the action of 5 December, Pfc. William A. McWhorter\r\nsacrificed his life that a companion might live. He deliberately held\r\nnext to his body and away from his comrade a Japanese grenade which\r\nhad been thrown into his position. The charge exploded and killed him\r\ninstantly but did not harm his companion. He was awarded posthumously\r\nthe Medal of Honor.\r\n\r\n[1084] \"However for a patrol from Company I [127th Infantry] it was a\r\nred letter day in that the patrol found a bottle of U.S. Golden Wedding\r\nWiskey [sic] at an evacuated Jap hospital.
