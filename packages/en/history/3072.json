The young men of to-day were then babes in their cradles, or,\r\nif more than that, too young to be appalled by the terror of the times.\r\nThose now graduating from our schools of learning to be teachers of\r\nyouth and leaders of public thought, if they are ever prepared to teach\r\nthe history of the war for the Union so as to render adequate honor to\r\nits martyrs and heroes, and at the same time impress the obvious moral\r\nto be drawn from it, must derive their knowledge from authors who can\r\neach one say of the thrilling story he is spared to tell: “All of which\r\nI saw, and part of which I was.”\r\n\r\nThe writer is honored with the privilege of introducing to the reader\r\na volume written by an author who was an actor and a sufferer in the\r\nscenes he has so vividly and faithfully described, and sent forth to\r\nthe public by a publisher whose literary contributions in support of\r\nthe loyal cause entitle him to the highest appreciation. Both author\r\nand publisher have had an honorable and efficient part in the great\r\nstruggle, and are therefore worthy to hand down to the future a record\r\nof the perils encountered and the sufferings endured by patriotic\r\nsoldiers in the prisons of the enemy. The publisher, at the beginning\r\nof the war, entered, with zeal and ardor upon the work of raising\r\na company of men, intending to lead them to the field. Prevented\r\nfrom carrying out this design, his energies were directed to a more\r\neffective service. His famous “Nasby Letters” exposed the absurd and\r\nsophistical argumentations of rebels and their sympathisers, in such\r\nbroad, attractive and admirable burlesque, as to direct against them\r\nthe “loud, long laughter of a world!” The unique and telling satire of\r\nthese papers became a power and inspiration to our armies in the field\r\nand to their anxious friends at home, more than equal to the might of\r\nwhole battalions poured in upon the enemy. An athlete in logic may\r\nlay an error writhing at his feet, and after all it may recover to do\r\ngreat mischief. But the sharp wit of the humorist drives it before the\r\nworld’s derision into shame and everlasting contempt. These letters\r\nwere read and shouted over gleefully at every camp-fire in the Union\r\nArmy, and eagerly devoured by crowds of listeners when mails were\r\nopened at country post-offices. Other humorists were content when they\r\nsimply amused the reader, but “Nasby’s” jests were arguments--they had\r\na meaning--they were suggested by the necessities and emergencies of the\r\nNation’s peril, and written to support, with all earnestness, a most\r\nsacred cause.\r\n\r\nThe author, when very young, engaged in journalistic work, until the\r\ndrum of the recruiting officer called him to join the ranks of his\r\ncountry’s defenders. As the reader is told, he was made a prisoner.\r\nHe took with him into the terrible prison enclosure not only a brave,\r\nvigorous, youthful spirit, but invaluable habits of mind and thought\r\nfor storing up the incidents and experiences of his prison life. As a\r\njournalist he had acquired the habit of noticing and memorizing every\r\nstriking or thrilling incident, and the experiences of his prison\r\nlife were adapted to enstamp themselves indelibly on both feeling and\r\nmemory. He speaks from personal experience and from the stand-paint of\r\ntender and complete sympathy with those of his comrades who suffered\r\nmore than he did himself. Of his qualifications, the writer of these\r\nintroductory words need not speak. The sketches themselves testify to\r\nhis ability with such force that no commendation is required.\r\n\r\nThis work is needed. A generation is arising who do not know what the\r\npreservation of our free government cost in blood and suffering. Even\r\nthe men of the passing generation begin to be forgetful, if we may\r\njudge from the recklessness or carelessness of their political action.\r\nThe soldier is not always remembered nor honored as he should be. But,\r\nwhat to the future of the great Republic is more important, there is\r\ngreat danger of our people under-estimating the bitter animus and\r\nterrible malignity to the Union and its defenders cherished by those\r\nwho made war upon it. This is a point we can not afford to be mistaken\r\nabout. And yet, right at this point this volume will meet its severest\r\ncriticism, and at this point its testimony is most vital and necessary.\r\n\r\nMany will be slow to believe all that is here told most truthfully\r\nof the tyranny and cruelty of the captors of our brave boys in\r\nblue. There are no parallels to the cruelties and malignities here\r\ndescribed in Northern society. The system of slavery, maintained for\r\nover two hundred years at the South, had performed a most perverting,\r\nmorally desolating, and we might say, demonizing work on the dominant\r\nrace, which people bred under our free civilization can not at once\r\nunderstand, nor scarcely believe when it is declared unto them. This\r\nreluctance to believe unwelcome truths has been the snare of our\r\nnational life. We have not been willing to believe how hardened,\r\ndespotic, and cruel the wielders of irresponsible power may become.\r\n\r\nWhen the anti-slavery reformers of thirty years ago set forth the\r\ncruelties of the slave system, they were met with a storm of indignant\r\ndenial, villification and rebuke. When Theodore D. Weld issued his\r\n“Testimony of a Thousand Witnesses,” to the cruelty of slavery, he\r\nintroduced it with a few words, pregnant with sound philosophy, which\r\ncan be applied to the work now introduced, and may help the reader\r\nbetter to accept and appreciate its statements. Mr. Weld said:\r\n\r\n“Suppose I should seize you, rob you of your liberty, drive you into\r\nthe field, and make you work without pay as long as you lived. Would\r\nthat be justice? Would it be kindness? Or would it be monstrous\r\ninjustice and cruelty? Now, is the man who robs you every day too\r\ntender-hearted ever to cuff or kick you? He can empty your pockets\r\nwithout remorse, but if your stomach is empty, it cuts him to the\r\nquick. He can make you work a life-time without pay, but loves you\r\ntoo well to let you go hungry. He fleeces you of your rights with a\r\nrelish, but is shocked if you work bare-headed in summer, or without\r\nwarm stockings in winter. He can make you go without your liberty,\r\nbut never without a shirt. He can crush in you all hope of bettering\r\nyour condition by vowing that you shall die his slave, but though he\r\ncan thus cruelly torture your feelings, he will never lacerate your\r\nback--he can break your heart, but is very tender of your skin. He can\r\nstrip you of all protection of law, and all comfort in religion, and\r\nthus expose you to all outrages, but if you are exposed to the weather,\r\nhalf-clad and half-sheltered, how yearn his tender bowels! What! talk\r\nof a man treating you well while robbing you of all you get, and as\r\nfast as you get it? And robbing you of yourself, too, your hands and\r\nfeet, your muscles, limbs and senses, your body and mind, your liberty\r\nand earnings, your free speech and rights of conscience, your right to\r\nacquire knowledge, property and reputation, and yet you are content to\r\nbelieve without question that men who do all this by their slaves have\r\nsoft hearts oozing out so lovingly toward their human chattles that\r\nthey always keep them well housed and well clad, never push them too\r\nhard in the field, never make their dear backs smart, nor let their\r\ndear stomachs get empty!”\r\n\r\nIn like manner we may ask, are not the cruelties and oppressions\r\ndescribed in the following pages what we should legitimately expect\r\nfrom men who, all their lives, have used whip and thumb-screw, shot-gun\r\nand bloodhound, to keep human beings subservient to their will? Are we\r\nto expect nothing but chivalric tenderness and compassion from men who\r\nmade war on a tolerant government to make more secure their barbaric\r\nsystem of oppression?\r\n\r\nThese things are written because they are true. Duty to the brave\r\ndead, to the heroic living, who have endured the pangs of a hundred\r\ndeaths for their country’s sake; duty to the government which depends\r\non the wisdom and constancy of its good citizens for its support and\r\nperpetuity, calls for this “round, unvarnished tale” of suffering\r\nendured for freedom’s sake.\r\n\r\nThe publisher of this work urged his friend and associate in journalism\r\nto write and send forth these sketches because the times demanded just\r\nsuch an expose of the inner hell of the Southern prisons. The tender\r\nmercies of oppressors are cruel. We must accept the truth and act in\r\nview of it. Acting wisely on the warnings of the past, we shall be able\r\nto prevent treason, with all its fearful concomitants, from being again\r\nthe scourge and terror of our beloved land.\r\n\r\nROBERT McCUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR’S PREFACE\r\n\r\nFifteen months ago--and one month before it was begun--I had no more\r\nidea of writing this book than I have now of taking up my residence in\r\nChina.\r\n\r\nWhile I have always been deeply impressed with the idea that the\r\npublic should know much more of the history of Andersonville and other\r\nSouthern prisons than it does, it had never occurred to me that I was\r\nin any way charged with the duty of increasing that enlightenment.\r\n\r\nNo affected deprecation of my own abilities had any part is this.\r\nI certainly knew enough of the matter, as did every other boy who\r\nhad even a month’s experience in those terrible places, but the\r\nvery magnitude of that knowledge overpowered me, by showing me the\r\nvast requirements of the subject-requirements that seemed to make\r\nit presumption for any but the greatest pens in our literature to\r\nattempt the work. One day at Andersonville or Florence would be task\r\nenough for the genius of Carlyle or Hugo; lesser than they would fail\r\npreposterously to rise to the level of the theme. No writer ever\r\ndescribed such a deluge of woes as swept over the unfortunates confined\r\nin Rebel prisons in the last year-and-a-half of the Confederacy’s life.\r\nNo man was ever called upon to describe the spectacle and the process\r\nof seventy thousand young, strong, able-bodied men, starving and\r\nrotting to death. Such a gigantic tragedy as this stuns the mind and\r\nbenumbs the imagination.\r\n\r\nI no more felt myself competent to the task than to accomplish one of\r\nMichael Angelo’s grand creations in sculpture or painting.\r\n\r\nStudy of the subject since confirms me in this view, and my only claim\r\nfor this book is that it is a contribution--a record of individual\r\nobservation and experience--which will add something to the material\r\nwhich the historian of the future will find available for his work.\r\n\r\nThe work was begun at the suggestion of Mr. D. R. Locke, (Petroleum V.\r\nNasby), the eminent political satirist. At first it was only intended\r\nto write a few short serial sketches of prison life for the columns\r\nof the TOLEDO BLADE. The exceeding favor with which the first of the\r\nseries was received induced a great widening of their scope, until\r\nfinally they took the range they now have.\r\n\r\nI know that what is contained herein will be bitterly denied. I am\r\nprepared for this. In my boyhood I witnessed the savagery of the\r\nSlavery agitation--in my youth I felt the fierceness of the hatred\r\ndirected against all those who stood by the Nation. I know that hell\r\nhath no fury like the vindictiveness of those who are hurt by the\r\ntruth being told of them. I apprehend being assailed by a sirocco\r\nof contradiction and calumny. But I solemnly affirm in advance the\r\nentire and absolute truth of every material fact, statement and\r\ndescription. I assert that, so far from there being any exaggeration\r\nin any particular, that in no instance has the half of the truth\r\nbeen told, nor could it be, save by an inspired pen. I am ready to\r\ndemonstrate this by any test that the deniers of this may require,\r\nand I am fortified in my position by unsolicited letters from over\r\n3,000 surviving prisoners, warmly indorsing the account as thoroughly\r\naccurate in every respect.\r\n\r\nIt has been charged that hatred of the South is the animus of this\r\nwork. Nothing can be farther from the truth. No one has a deeper love\r\nfor every part of our common country than I, and no one to-day will\r\nmake more efforts and sacrifices to bring the South to the same plane\r\nof social and material development with the rest of the Nation than I\r\nwill. If I could see that the sufferings at Andersonville and elsewhere\r\ncontributed in any considerable degree to that end, and I should not\r\nregret that they had been. Blood and tears mark every step in the\r\nprogress of the race, and human misery seems unavoidable in securing\r\nhuman advancement. But I am naturally embittered by the fruitlessness,\r\nas well as the uselessness of the misery of Andersonville. There was\r\nnever the least military or other reason for inflicting all that\r\nwretchedness upon men, and, as far as mortal eye can discern, no\r\nearthly good resulted from the martyrdom of those tens of thousands.\r\nI wish I could see some hope that their wantonly shed blood has sown\r\nseeds that will one day blossom, and bear a rich fruitage of benefit to\r\nmankind, but it saddens me beyond expression that I can not.\r\n\r\nThe years 1864-5 were a season of desperate battles, but in that\r\ntime many more Union soldiers were slain behind the Rebel armies, by\r\nstarvation and exposure, than were killed in front of them by cannon\r\nand rifle. The country has heard much of the heroism and sacrifices of\r\nthose loyal youths who fell on the field of battle; but it has heard\r\nlittle of the still greater number who died in prison pen. It knows\r\nfull well how grandly her sons met death in front of the serried ranks\r\nof treason, and but little of the sublime firmness with which they\r\nendured unto the death, all that the ingenious cruelty of their foes\r\ncould inflict upon them while in captivity.\r\n\r\nIt is to help supply this deficiency that this book is written. It is\r\na mite contributed to the better remembrance by their countrymen of\r\nthose who in this way endured and died that the Nation might live. It\r\nis an offering of testimony to future generations of the measureless\r\ncost of the expiation of a national sin, and of the preservation of our\r\nnational unity.\r\n\r\nThis is all. I know I speak for all those still living comrades who\r\nwent with me through the scenes that I have attempted to describe, when\r\nI say that we have no revenges to satisfy, no hatreds to appease. We do\r\nnot ask that anyone shall be punished. We only desire that the Nation\r\nshall recognize and remember the grand fidelity of our dead comrades,\r\nand take abundant care that they shall not have died in vain.\r\n\r\nFor the great mass of Southern people we have only the kindliest\r\nfeeling. We but hate a vicious social system, the lingering shadow of\r\na darker age, to which they yield, and which, by elevating bad men to\r\npower, has proved their own and their country’s bane.\r\n\r\nThe following story does not claim to be in any sense a history of\r\nSouthern prisons. It is simply a record of the experience of one\r\nindividual--one boy--who staid all the time with his comrades inside\r\nthe prison, and had no better opportunities for gaining information\r\nthan any other of his 60,000 companions.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the illustrations in this work are from the skilled\r\npencil of Captain O. J. Hopkins, of Toledo, who served through the war\r\nin the ranks of the Forty-second Ohio. His army experience has been of\r\npeculiar value to the work, as it has enabled him to furnish a series\r\nof illustrations whose life-like fidelity of action, pose and detail\r\nare admirable.\r\n\r\nSome thirty of the pictures, including the frontispiece, and the\r\nallegorical illustrations of War and Peace, are from the atelier of Mr.\r\nO. Reich, Cincinnati, O.\r\n\r\nA word as to the spelling: Having always been an ardent believer in\r\nthe reformation of our present preposterous system--or rather, no\r\nsystem--of orthography, I am anxious to do whatever lies in my power\r\nto promote it. In the following pages the spelling is simplified to\r\nthe last degree allowed by Webster. I hope that the time is near when\r\neven that advanced spelling reformer will be left far in the rear by\r\nthe progress of a people thoroughly weary of longer slavery to the\r\northographical absurdities handed down to us from a remote and grossly\r\nunlearned ancestry.\r\n\r\nToledo, O., Dec. 10, 1879.\r\n\r\nJOHN McELROY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe wait beneath the furnace blast\r\nThe pangs of transformation;\r\nNot painlessly doth God recast\r\nAnd mold anew the nation.\r\nHot burns the fire\r\nWhere wrongs expire;\r\nNor spares the hand\r\nThat from the land\r\nUproots the ancient evil.\r\n\r\nThe hand-breadth cloud the sages feared\r\nIts bloody rain is dropping;\r\nThe poison plant the fathers spared\r\nAll else is overtopping.\r\nEast, West, South, North,\r\nIt curses the earth;\r\nAll justice dies,\r\nAnd fraud and lies\r\nLive only in its shadow.\r\n\r\nThen let the selfish lip be dumb\r\nAnd hushed the breath of sighing;\r\nBefore the joy of peace must come\r\nThe pains of purifying.\r\nGod give us grace\r\nEach in his place\r\nTo bear his lot,\r\nAnd, murmuring not,\r\nEndure and wait and labor!\r\n\r\nWHITTIER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSONVILLE\r\n\r\nA STORY OF REBEL MILITARY PRISONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nA STRANGE LAND--THE HEART OF THE APPALACHIANS--THE GATEWAY OF AN EMPIRE\r\n--A SEQUESTERED VALE, AND A PRIMITIVE, ARCADIAN, NON-PROGRESSIVE PEOPLE.\r\n\r\nA low, square, plainly-hewn stone, set near the summit of the eastern\r\napproach to the formidable natural fortress of Cumberland Gap,\r\nindicates the boundaries of--the three great States of Virginia,\r\nKentucky and Tennessee. It is such a place as, remembering the old\r\nGreek and Roman myths and superstitions, one would recognize as fitting\r\nto mark the confines of the territories of great masses of strong,\r\naggressive, and frequently conflicting peoples. There the god Terminus\r\nshould have had one of his chief temples, where his shrine would be\r\nshadowed by barriers rising above the clouds, and his sacred solitude\r\nguarded from the rude invasion of armed hosts by range on range of\r\nbattlemented rocks, crowning almost inaccessible mountains, interposed\r\nacross every approach from the usual haunts of men.\r\n\r\nRoundabout the land is full of strangeness and mystery. The throes of\r\nsome great convulsion of Nature are written on the face of the four\r\nthousand square miles of territory, of which Cumberland Gap is the\r\ncentral point. Miles of granite mountains are thrust up like giant\r\nwalls, hundreds of feet high, and as smooth and regular as the side of\r\na monument.\r\n\r\nHuge, fantastically-shaped rocks abound everywhere--sometimes rising\r\ninto pinnacles on lofty summits--sometimes hanging over the verge of\r\nbeetling cliffs, as if placed there in waiting for a time when they\r\ncould be hurled down upon the path of an advancing army, and sweep it\r\naway.\r\n\r\nLarge streams of water burst out in the most unexpected planes,\r\nfrequently far up mountain sides, and fall in silver veils upon\r\nstones beaten round by the ceaseless dash for ages. Caves, rich in\r\nquaintly formed stalactites and stalagmites, and their recesses filled\r\nwith metallic salts of the most powerful and diverse natures; break\r\nthe mountain sides at frequent intervals. Everywhere one is met by\r\nsurprises and anomalies. Even the rank vegetation is eccentric, and as\r\nprone to develop into bizarre forms as are the rocks and mountains.\r\n\r\nThe dreaded panther ranges through the primeval, rarely trodden\r\nforests; every crevice in the rocks has for tenants rattlesnakes or\r\nstealthy copperheads, while long, wonderfully swift “blue racers” haunt\r\nthe edges of the woods, and linger around the fields to chill his\r\nblood who catches a glimpse of their upreared heads, with their great,\r\nbalefully bright eyes, and “white-collar” encircled throats.\r\n\r\nThe human events happening here have been in harmony with the natural\r\nones. It has always been a land of conflict. In 1540--339 years ago\r\n--De Soto, in that energetic but fruitless search for gold which\r\noccupied his later years, penetrated to this region, and found it the\r\nfastness of the Xualans, a bold, aggressive race, continually warring\r\nwith its neighbors. When next the white man reached the country--a\r\ncentury and a half later--he found the Xualans had been swept away by\r\nthe conquering Cherokees, and he witnessed there the most sanguinary\r\ncontest between Indians of which our annals give any account--a pitched\r\nbattle two days in duration, between the invading Shawnees, who lorded\r\nit over what is now Kentucky, Ohio and Indiana--and the Cherokees, who\r\ndominated the country the southeast of the Cumberland range. Again the\r\nCherokees were victorious, and the discomfited Shawnees retired north\r\nof the Gap.\r\n\r\nThen the white man delivered battle for the possession the land, and\r\nbought it with the lives of many gallant adventurers. Half a century\r\nlater Boone and his hardy companion followed, and forced their way into\r\nKentucky.\r\n\r\nAnother half century saw the Gap the favorite haunt of the greatest\r\nof American bandits--the noted John A. Murrell--and his gang. They\r\ninfested the country for years, now waylaying the trader or drover\r\nthreading his toilsome way over the lone mountains, now descending upon\r\nsome little town, to plunder its stores and houses.\r\n\r\nAt length Murrell and his band were driven out, and sought a new field\r\nof operations on the Lower Mississippi. They left germs behind them,\r\nhowever, that developed into horse thieve counterfeiters, and later\r\ninto guerrillas and bushwhackers.\r\n\r\nWhen the Rebellion broke out the region at once became the theater of\r\nmilitary operations. Twice Cumberland Gap was seized by the Rebels, and\r\ntwice was it wrested away from them. In 1861 it was the point whence\r\nZollicoffer launched out with his legions to “liberate Kentucky,” and\r\nit was whither they fled, beaten and shattered, after the disasters of\r\nWild Cat and Mill Springs. In 1862 Kirby Smith led his army through the\r\nGap on his way to overrun Kentucky and invade the North. Three months\r\nlater his beaten forces sought refuge from their pursuers behind its\r\nimpregnable fortifications. Another year saw Burnside burst through the\r\nGap with a conquering force and redeem loyal East Tennessee from its\r\nRebel oppressors.\r\n\r\nHad the South ever been able to separate from the North the boundary\r\nwould have been established along this line.\r\n\r\nBetween the main ridge upon which Cumberland Gap is situated, and the\r\nnext range on the southeast which runs parallel with it, is a narrow,\r\nlong, very fruitful valley, walled in on either side for a hundred\r\nmiles by tall mountains as a City street is by high buildings. It is\r\ncalled Powell’s Valley. In it dwell a simple, primitive people, shut\r\nout from the world almost as much as if they lived in New Zealand, and\r\nwith the speech, manners and ideas that their fathers brought into the\r\nValley when they settled it a century ago. There has been but little\r\nchange since then. The young men who have annually driven cattle to\r\nthe distant markets in Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia, have brought\r\nback occasional stray bits of finery for the “women folks,” and the\r\nlatest improved fire-arms for themselves, but this is about all the\r\ninnovations the progress of the world has been allowed to make. Wheeled\r\nvehicles are almost unknown; men and women travel on horseback as\r\nthey did a century ago, the clothing is the product of the farm and\r\nthe busy looms of the women, and life is as rural and Arcadian as any\r\never described in a pastoral. The people are rich in cattle, hogs,\r\nhorses, sheep and the products of the field. The fat soil brings forth\r\nthe substantials of life in opulent plenty. Having this there seems\r\nto be little care for more. Ambition nor avarice, nor yet craving\r\nafter luxury, disturb their contented souls or drag them away from the\r\nnon-progressive round of simple life bequeathed them by their fathers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nSCARCITY OF FOOD FOR THE ARMY--RAID FOR FORAGE--ENCOUNTER WIT THE\r\nREBELS --SHARP CAVALRY FIGHT--DEFEAT OF THE “JOHNNIES”--POWELL’S VALLEY\r\nOPENED UP.\r\n\r\nAs the Autumn of 1863 advanced towards Winter the difficulty of\r\nsupplying the forces concentrated around Cumberland Gap--as well as\r\nthe rest of Burnside’s army in East Tennessee--became greater and\r\ngreater. The base of supplies was at Camp Nelson, near Lexington,\r\nKy., one hundred and eighty miles from the Gap, and all that the Army\r\nused had to be hauled that distance by mule teams over roads that, in\r\ntheir best state were wretched, and which the copious rains and heavy\r\ntraffic had rendered well-nigh impassable. All the country to our\r\npossession had been drained of its stock of whatever would contribute\r\nto the support of man or beast. That portion of Powell’s Valley\r\nextending from the Gap into Virginia was still in the hands of the\r\nRebels; its stock of products was as yet almost exempt from military\r\ncontributions. Consequently a raid was projected to reduce the Valley\r\nto our possession, and secure its much needed stores. It was guarded by\r\nthe Sixty-fourth Virginia, a mounted regiment, made up of the young men\r\nof the locality, who had then been in the service about two years.\r\n\r\nMaj. C. H. Beer’s third Battalion, Sixteenth Illinois Cavalry--four\r\ncompanies, each about 75 strong--was sent on the errand of driving\r\nout the Rebels and opening up the Valley for our foraging teams. The\r\nwriter was invited to attend the excursion. As he held the honorable,\r\nbut not very lucrative position of “high, private” in Company L, of the\r\nBattalion, and the invitation came from his Captain, he did not feel at\r\nliberty to decline. He went, as private soldiers have been in the habit\r\nof doing ever since the days of the old Centurion, who said with the\r\ncharacteristic boastfulness of one of the lower grades of commissioned\r\nofficers when he happens to be a snob:\r\n\r\n     For I am also a man set under authority, having under me soldiers,\r\n     and I say unto one, Go; and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he\r\n     cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.\r\n\r\nRather “airy” talk that for a man who nowadays would take rank with\r\nCaptains of infantry.\r\n\r\nThree hundred of us responded to the signal of “boots and saddles,”\r\nbuckled on three hundred more or less trusty sabers and revolvers,\r\nsaddled three hundred more or less gallant steeds, came into line\r\n“as companies” with the automatic listlessness of the old soldiers,\r\n“counted off by fours” in that queer gamut-running style that makes a\r\ncompany of men “counting off”--each shouting a number in a different\r\nvoice from his neighbor--sound like running the scales on some great\r\norgan badly out of tune; something like this:\r\n\r\nOne. Two. Three. Four. One. Two. Three. Four. One. Two. Three. Four.\r\n\r\nThen, as the bugle sounded “Right forward! fours right!” we moved off\r\nat a walk through the melancholy mist that soaked through the very\r\nfiber of man and horse, and reduced the minds of both to a condition of\r\nlimp indifference as to things past, present and future.\r\n\r\nWhither we were going we knew not, nor cared. Such matters had long\r\nsince ceased to excite any interest. A cavalryman soon recognizes\r\nas the least astonishing thing in his existence the signal to “Fall\r\nin!” and start somewhere. He feels that he is the “Poor Joe” of the\r\nArmy--under perpetual orders to “move on.”\r\n\r\nDown we wound over the road that zig-tagged through the forts,\r\nbatteries and rifle-pits covering the eastern ascent to the Flap-past\r\nthe wonderful Murrell Spring--so-called because the robber chief had\r\nkilled, as he stooped to drink of its crystal waters, a rich drover,\r\nwhom he was pretending to pilot through the mountains--down to where\r\nthe “Virginia road” turned off sharply to the left and entered Powell’s\r\nValley. The mist had become a chill, dreary rain, through, which we\r\nplodded silently, until night closed in around us some ten miles from\r\nthe Gap. As we halted to go into camp, an indignant Virginian resented\r\nthe invasion of the sacred soil by firing at one of the guards moving\r\nout to his place. The guard looked at the fellow contemptuously, as\r\nif he hated to waste powder on a man who had no better sense than to\r\nstay out in such a rain, when he could go in-doors, and the bushwhacker\r\nescaped, without even a return shot.\r\n\r\nFires were built, coffee made, horses rubbed, and we laid down with\r\nfeet to the fire to get what sleep we could.\r\n\r\nBefore morning we were awakened by the bitter cold. It had cleared off\r\nduring the night and turned so cold that everything was frozen stiff.\r\nThis was better than the rain, at all events. A good fire and a hot cup\r\nof coffee would make the cold quite endurable.\r\n\r\nAt daylight the bugle sounded “Right forward! fours right!” again, and\r\nthe 300 of us resumed our onward plod over the rocky, cedar-crowned\r\nhills.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, other things were taking place elsewhere. Our esteemed\r\nfriends of the Sixty-fourth Virginia, who were in camp at the little\r\ntown of Jonesville, about 40 miles from the Gap, had learned of our\r\nstarting up the Valley to drive them out, and they showed that warm\r\nreciprocity characteristic of the Southern soldier, by mounting and\r\nstarting down the Valley to drive us out. Nothing could be more\r\nharmonious, it will be perceived. Barring the trifling divergence of\r\nyews as to who was to drive and who be driven, there was perfect accord\r\nin our ideas.\r\n\r\nOur numbers were about equal. If I were to say that they considerably\r\noutnumbered us, I would be following the universal precedent. No\r\nsoldier-high or low-ever admitted engaging an equal or inferior force\r\nof the enemy.\r\n\r\nAbout 9 o’clock in the morning--Sunday--they rode through the streets\r\nof Jonesville on their way to give us battle. It was here that most of\r\nthe members of the Regiment lived. Every man, woman and child in the\r\ntown was related in some way to nearly every one of the soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe women turned out to wave their fathers, husbands, brothers and\r\nlovers on to victory. The old men gathered to give parting counsel and\r\nencouragement to their sons and kindred. The Sixty-fourth rode away to\r\nwhat hope told them would be a glorious victory.\r\n\r\nAt noon we are still straggling along without much attempt at soldierly\r\norder, over the rough, frozen hill-sides. It is yet bitterly cold, and\r\nmen and horses draw themselves together, as if to expose as little\r\nsurface as possible to the unkind elements. Not a word had been spoken\r\nby any one for hours.\r\n\r\nThe head of the column has just reached the top of the hill, and the\r\nrest of us are strung along for a quarter of a mile or so back.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a few shots ring out upon the frosty air from the carbines\r\nof the advance. The general apathy is instantly, replaced by keen\r\nattention, and the boys instinctively range themselves into fours--the\r\ncavalry unit of action. The Major, who is riding about the middle of\r\nthe first Company--I--dashes to the front. A glance seems to satisfy\r\nhim, for he turns in his saddle and his voice rings out:\r\n\r\n“Company I! FOURS LEFT INTO LINE!--MARCH!!”\r\n\r\nThe Company swings around on the hill-top like a great, jointed toy\r\nsnake. As the fours come into line on a trot, we see every man draw\r\nhis saber and revolver. The Company raises a mighty cheer and dashes\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nCompany K presses forward to the ground Company I has just left,\r\nthe fours sweep around into line, the sabers and revolvers come out\r\nspontaneously, the men cheer and the Company flings itself forward.\r\n\r\nAll this time we of Company L can see nothing except what the companies\r\nahead of us are doing. We are wrought up to the highest pitch. As\r\nCompany K clears its ground, we press forward eagerly. Now we go into\r\nline just as we raise the hill, and as my four comes around, I catch\r\na hurried glimpse through a rift in the smoke of a line of butternut\r\nand gray clad men a hundred yards or so away. Their guns are at their\r\nfaces, and I see the smoke and fire spurt from the muzzles. At the same\r\ninstant our sabers and revolvers are drawn. We shout in a frenzy of\r\nexcitement, and the horses spring forward as if shot from a bow.\r\n\r\nI see nothing more until I reach the place where the Rebel line stood.\r\nThen I find it is gone. Looking beyond toward the bottom of the hill,\r\nI see the woods filled with Rebels, flying in disorder and our men\r\nyelling in pursuit. This is the portion of the line which Companies\r\nI and K struck. Here and there are men in butternut clothing, prone\r\non the frozen ground, wounded and dying. I have just time to notice\r\nclosely one middle-aged man lying almost under my horse’s feet. He has\r\nreceived a carbine bullet through his head and his blood colors a great\r\nspace around him.\r\n\r\nOne brave man, riding a roan horse, attempts to rally his companions.\r\nHe halts on a little knoll, wheels his horse to face us, and waves his\r\nhat to draw his companions to him. A tall, lank fellow in the next four\r\nto me--who goes by the nickname of “’Leven Yards”--aims his carbine at\r\nhim, and, without checking his horse’s pace, fires. The heavy Sharpe’s\r\nbullet tears a gaping hole through the Rebel’s heart. He drops from his\r\nsaddle, his life-blood runs down in little rills on either side of the\r\nknoll, and his riderless horse dashes away in a panic.\r\n\r\nAt this instant comes an order for the Company to break up into fours\r\nand press on through the forest in pursuit. My four trots off to the\r\nroad at the right. A Rebel bugler, who hag been cut off, leaps his\r\nhorse into the road in front of us. We all fire at him on the impulse\r\nof the moment. He falls from his horse with a bullet through his back.\r\nCompany M, which has remained in column as a reserve, is now thundering\r\nup close behind at a gallop. Its seventy-five powerful horses are\r\nspurning the solid earth with steel-clad hoofs. The man will be ground\r\ninto a shapeless mass if left where he has fallen. We spring from our\r\nhorses and drag him into a fence corner; then remount and join in the\r\npursuit.\r\n\r\nThis happened on the summit of Chestnut Ridge, fifteen miles from\r\nJonesville.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon the anxious watchers at Jonesville saw a single\r\nfugitive urging his well-nigh spent horse down the slope of the hill\r\ntoward town. In an agony of anxiety they hurried forward to meet him\r\nand learn his news.\r\n\r\nThe first messenger who rushed into Job’s presence to announce the\r\nbeginning of the series of misfortunes which were to afflict the\r\nupright man of Uz is a type of all the cowards who, before or since\r\nthen, have been the first to speed away from the field of battle to\r\nspread the news of disaster. He said:\r\n\r\n    “And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have\r\n    slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped\r\n    alone to tell thee.”\r\n\r\nSo this fleeing Virginian shouted to his expectant friends:\r\n\r\n“The boys are all cut to pieces; I’m the only one that got away.”\r\n\r\nThe terrible extent of his words was belied a little later, by the\r\nappearance on the distant summit of the hill of a considerable mob\r\nof fugitives, flying at the utmost speed of their nearly exhausted\r\nhorses. As they came on down the hill as almost equally disorganized\r\ncrowd of pursuers appeared on the summit, yelling in voices hoarse\r\nwith continued shouting, and pouring an incessant fire of carbine and\r\nrevolver bullets upon the hapless men of the Sixty-fourth Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe two masses of men swept on through the town. Beyond it, the road\r\nbranched in several directions, the pursued scattered on each of these,\r\nand the worn-out pursuers gave up the chase.\r\n\r\nReturning to Jonesville, we took an account of stock, and found that\r\nwe were “ahead” one hundred and fifteen prisoners, nearly that many\r\nhorses, and a considerable quantity of small arms. How many of the\r\nenemy had been killed and wounded could not be told, as they were\r\nscattered over the whole fifteen miles between where the fight occurred\r\nand the pursuit ended. Our loss was trifling.\r\n\r\nComparing notes around the camp-fires in the evening, we found that\r\nour success had been owing to the Major’s instinct, his grasp of the\r\nsituation, and the soldierly way in which he took advantage of it. When\r\nhe reached the summit of the hill he found the Rebel line nearly formed\r\nand ready for action. A moment’s hesitation might have been fatal to\r\nus. At his command Company I went into line with the thought-like\r\ncelerity of trained cavalry, and instantly dashed through the right\r\nof the Rebel line. Company K followed and plunged through the Rebel\r\ncenter, and when we of Company L arrived on the ground, and charged the\r\nleft, the last vestige of resistance was swept away. The whole affair\r\ndid not probably occupy more than fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nThis was the way Powell’s Valley was opened to our foragers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nLIVING OFF THE ENEMY--REVELING IN THE FATNESS OF THE COUNTRY--SOLDIERLY\r\nPURVEYING AND CAMP COOKERY--SUSCEPTIBLE TEAMSTERS AND THEIR TENDENCY TO\r\nFLIGHTINESS--MAKING SOLDIER’S BED.\r\n\r\nFor weeks we rode up and down--hither and thither--along the length\r\nof the narrow, granite-walled Valley; between mountains so lofty that\r\nthe sun labored slowly over them in the morning, occupying half the\r\nforenoon in getting to where his rays would reach the stream that ran\r\nthrough the Valley’s center. Perpetual shadow reigned on the northern\r\nand western faces of these towering Nights--not enough warmth and\r\nsunshine reaching them in the cold months to check the growth of the\r\never-lengthening icicles hanging from the jutting cliffs, or melt the\r\narabesque frost-forms with which the many dashing cascades decorated\r\nthe adjacent rocks and shrubbery. Occasionally we would see where some\r\nlittle stream ran down over the face of the bare, black rocks for many\r\nhundred feet, and then its course would be a long band of sheeny white,\r\nlike a great rich, spotless scarf of satin, festooning the war-grimed\r\nwalls of some old castle.\r\n\r\nOur duty now was to break up any nuclei of concentration that the\r\nRebels might attempt to form, and to guard our foragers--that is, the\r\nteamsters and employee of the Quartermaster’s Department--who were\r\nloading grain into wagons and hauling it away.\r\n\r\nThis last was an arduous task. There is no man in the world that needs\r\nas much protection as an Army teamster. He is worse in this respect\r\nthan a New England manufacturer, or an old maid on her travels. He is\r\ngiven to sudden fears and causeless panics. Very innocent cedars have\r\na fashion of assuming in his eyes the appearance of desperate Rebels\r\narmed with murderous guns, and there is no telling what moment a rock\r\nmay take such a form as to freeze his young blood, and make each\r\nparticular hair stand on end like quills upon the fretful porcupine.\r\nOne has to be particular about snapping caps in his neighborhood,\r\nand give to him careful warning before discharging a carbine to\r\nclean it. His first impulse, when anything occurs to jar upon his\r\ndelicate nerves, is to cut his wheel-mule loose and retire with the\r\nprecipitation of a man having an appointment to keep and being behind\r\ntime. There is no man who can get as much speed out of a mule as a\r\nteamster falling back from the neighborhood of heavy firing.\r\n\r\nThis nervous tremor was not peculiar to the engineers of our\r\ntransportation department. It was noticeable in the gentry who carted\r\nthe scanty provisions of the Rebels. One of Wheeler’s cavalrymen told\r\nme that the brigade to which he belonged was one evening ordered to\r\nmove at daybreak. The night was rainy, and it was thought best to\r\ndischarge the guns and reload before starting. Unfortunately, it was\r\nneglected to inform the teamsters of this, and at the first discharge\r\nthey varnished from the scene with such energy that it was over a week\r\nbefore the brigade succeeded in getting them back again.\r\n\r\nWhy association with the mule should thus demoralize a man, has\r\nalways been a puzzle to me, for while the mule, as Col. Ingersoll has\r\nremarked, is an animal without pride of ancestry or hope of posterity,\r\nhe is still not a coward by any means. It is beyond dispute that a\r\nfull-grown and active lioness once attacked a mule in the grounds\r\nof the Cincinnati Zoological Garden, and was ignominiously beaten,\r\nreceiving injuries from which she died shortly afterward.\r\n\r\nThe apparition of a badly-scared teamster urging one of his wheel mules\r\nat break-neck speed over the rough ground, yelling for protection\r\nagainst “them Johnnies,” who had appeared on some hilltop in sight of\r\nwhere he was gathering corn, was an almost hourly occurrence. Of course\r\nthe squad dispatched to his assistance found nobody.\r\n\r\nStill, there were plenty of Rebels in the country, and they hung around\r\nour front, exchanging shots with us at long taw, and occasionally\r\ntreating us to a volley at close range, from some favorable point.\r\nBut we had the decided advantage of them at this game. Our Sharpe’s\r\ncarbines were much superior in every way to their Enfields. They\r\nwould shoot much farther, and a great deal more rapidly, so that the\r\nVirginians were not long in discovering that they were losing more than\r\nthey gained in this useless warfare.\r\n\r\nOnce they played a sharp practical joke upon us. Copper River is a\r\ndeep, exceedingly rapid mountain stream, with a very slippery rocky\r\nbottom. The Rebels blockaded a ford in such a way that it was almost\r\nimpossible for a horse to keep his feet. Then they tolled us off in\r\npursuit of a small party to this ford. When we came to it there was\r\na light line of skirmishers on the opposite bank, who popped away at\r\nus industriously. Our boys formed in line, gave the customary, cheer,\r\nand dashed in to carry the ford at a charge. As they did so at least\r\none-half of the horses went down as if they were shot, and rolled over\r\ntheir riders in the swift running, ice-cold waters. The Rebels yelled\r\na triumphant laugh, as they galloped away, and the laugh was re-echoed\r\nby our fellows, who were as quick to see the joke as the other side. We\r\ntried to get even with them by a sharp chase, but we gave it up after a\r\nfew miles, without having taken any prisoners.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, there was much to make our sojourn in the Valley\r\nendurable. Though we did not wear fine linen, we fared sumptuously--for\r\nsoldiers--every day. The cavalryman is always charged by the infantry\r\nand artillery with having a finer and surer scent for the good things\r\nin the country than any other man in the service. He is believed to\r\nhave an instinct that will unfailingly lead him, in the dankest night,\r\nto the roosting place of the most desirable poultry, and after he has\r\ncamped in a neighborhood for awhile it would require a close chemical\r\nanalysis to find a trace of ham.\r\n\r\nWe did our best to sustain the reputation of our arm of the service.\r\nWe found the most delicious hams packed away in the ash-houses. They\r\nwere small, and had that; exquisite nutty flavor, peculiar to mast-fed\r\nbacon. Then there was an abundance of the delightful little apple known\r\nas “romanites.” There were turnips, pumpkins, cabbages, potatoes, and\r\nthe usual products of the field in plenty, even profusion. The corn\r\nin the fields furnished an ample supply of breadstuff. We carried it\r\nto and ground it in the quaintest, rudest little mills that can be\r\nimagined outside of the primitive affairs by which the women of Arabia\r\ncoarsely powder the grain for the family meal. Sometimes the mill would\r\nconsist only of four stout posts thrust into the ground at the edge of\r\nsome stream. A line of boulders reaching diagonally across the stream\r\nanswered for a dam, by diverting a portion of the volume of water to a\r\nchannel at the side, where it moved a clumsily constructed wheel, that\r\nturned two small stones, not larger than good-sized grindstones. Over\r\nthis would be a shed made by resting poles in forked posts stuck into\r\nthe ground, and covering these with clapboards held in place by large\r\nflat stones. They resembled the mills of the gods--in grinding slowly.\r\nIt used to seem that a healthy man could eat the meal faster than they\r\nground it.\r\n\r\nBut what savory meals we used to concoct around the campfires, out of\r\nthe rich materials collected during the day’s ride! Such stews, such\r\nsoups, such broils, such wonderful commixtures of things diverse in\r\nnature and antagonistic in properties such daring culinary experiments\r\nin combining materials never before attempted to be combined. The\r\nFrench say of untasteful arrangement of hues in dress “that the colors\r\nswear at each other.” I have often thought the same thing of the\r\nheterogeneities that go to make up a soldier’s pot-a feu.\r\n\r\nBut for all that they never failed to taste deliciously after a long\r\nday’s ride. They were washed down by a tincupful of coffee strong\r\nenough to tan leather, then came a brier-wood pipeful of fragrant\r\nkinnikinnic, and a seat by the ruddy, sparkling fire of aromatic cedar\r\nlogs, that diffused at once warmth, and spicy, pleasing incense. A\r\nchat over the events of the day, and the prospect of the morrow, the\r\nwonderful merits of each man’s horse, and the disgusting irregularities\r\nof the mails from home, lasted until the silver-voiced bugle rang out\r\nthe sweet, mournful tattoo of the Regulations, to the flowing cadences\r\nof which the boys had arranged the absurdly incongruous words:\r\n\r\n          “S-a-y--D-e-u-t-c-h-e-r-will-you fight-mit Sigel!\r\n          Zwei-glass of lager-bier, ja! ja! JA!”\r\n\r\nWords were fitted to all the calls, which generally bore some\r\nrelativeness to the signal, but these were as, destitute of congruity\r\nas of sense.\r\n\r\nTattoo always produces an impression of extreme loneliness. As its\r\nweird, half-availing notes ring out and are answered back from\r\nthe distant rocks shrouded in night, and perhaps concealing the\r\nlurking foe, the soldier remembers that he is far away from home and\r\nfriends--deep in the enemy’s country, encompassed on every hand by\r\nthose in deadly hostility to him, who are perhaps even then maturing\r\nthe preparations for his destruction.\r\n\r\nAs the tattoo sounds, the boys arise from around the fire, visit the\r\nhorse line, see that their horses are securely tied, rub off from\r\nthe fetlocks and legs such specks of mud as may have escaped the\r\ncleaning in the early evening, and if possible, smuggle their faithful\r\nfour-footed friends a few ears of corn, or another bunch of hay.\r\n\r\nIf not too tired, and everything else is favorable, the cavalryman has\r\nprepared himself a comfortable couch for the night. He always sleeps\r\nwith a chum. The two have gathered enough small tufts of pine or cedar\r\nto make a comfortable, springy, mattress-like foundation. On this is\r\nlaid the poncho or rubber blanket. Next comes one of their overcoats,\r\nand upon this they lie, covering themselves with the two blankets and\r\nthe other overcoat, their feet towards the fire, their boots at the\r\nfoot, and their belts, with revolver, saber and carbine, at the sides\r\nof the bed. It is surprising what an amount of comfort a man can get\r\nout of such a couch, and how, at an alarm, he springs from it, almost\r\ninstantly dressed and armed.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour after tattoo the bugle rings out another sadly sweet\r\nstrain, that hath a dying sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nA BITTER COLD MORNING AND A WARM AWAKENING--TROUBLE ALL ALONG THE LINE\r\n--FIERCE CONFLICTS, ASSAULTS AND DEFENSE--PROLONGED AND DESPERATE\r\nSTRUGGLE ENDING WITH A SURRENDER.\r\n\r\nThe night had been the most intensely cold that the country had\r\nknown for many years. Peach and other tender trees had been killed\r\nby the frosty rigor, and sentinels had been frozen to death in our\r\nneighborhood. The deep snow on which we made our beds, the icy covering\r\nof the streams near us, the limbs of the trees above us, had been\r\ncracking with loud noises all night, from the bitter cold.\r\n\r\nWe were camped around Jonesville, each of the four companies lying on\r\none of the roads leading from the town. Company L lay about a mile from\r\nthe Court House. On a knoll at the end of the village toward us, and at\r\na point where two roads separated,--one of which led to us,--stood a\r\nthree-inch Rodman rifle, belonging to the Twenty-second Ohio Battery.\r\nIt and its squad of eighteen men, under command of Lieutenant Alger and\r\nSergeant Davis, had been sent up to us a few days before from the Gap.\r\n\r\nThe comfortless gray dawn was crawling sluggishly over the\r\nmountain-tops, as if numb as the animal and vegetable life which had\r\nbeen shrinking all the long hours under the fierce chill.\r\n\r\nThe Major’s bugler had saluted the morn with the lively, ringing\r\ntarr-r-r-a-ta-ara of the Regulation reveille, and the company buglers,\r\nas fast as they could thaw out their mouth-pieces, were answering him.\r\n\r\nI lay on my bed, dreading to get up, and yet not anxious to lie still.\r\nIt was a question which would be the more uncomfortable. I turned over,\r\nto see if there was not another position in which it would be warmer,\r\nand began wishing for the thousandth time that the efforts for the\r\namelioration of the horrors of warfare would progress to such a point\r\nas to put a stop to all Winter soldiering, so that a fellow could go\r\nhome as soon as cold weather began, sit around a comfortable stove in\r\na country store; and tell camp stories until the Spring was far enough\r\nadvanced to let him go back to the front wearing a straw hat and a\r\nlinen duster.\r\n\r\nThen I began wondering how much longer I would dare lie there, before\r\nthe Orderly Sergeant would draw me out by the heels, and accompany the\r\noperation with numerous unkind and sulphurous remarks.\r\n\r\nThis cogitation, was abruptly terminated by hearing an excited shout\r\nfrom the Captain:\r\n\r\n“Turn Out!--COMPANY L!! TURNOUT!!!”\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same instant rose that shrill, piercing Rebel yell, which\r\none who has once heard it rarely forgets, and this was followed by a\r\ncrashing volley from apparently a regiment of rifles.\r\n\r\nI arose-promptly.\r\n\r\nThere was evidently something of more interest on hand than the weather.\r\n\r\nCap, overcoat, boots and revolver belt went on, and eyes opened at\r\nabout the same instant.\r\n\r\nAs I snatched up my carbine, I looked out in front, and the whole woods\r\nappeared to be full of Rebels, rushing toward us, all yelling and some\r\nfiring. My Captain and First Lieutenant had taken up position on the\r\nright front of the tents, and part of the boys were running up to form\r\na line alongside them. The Second Lieutenant had stationed himself on a\r\nknoll on the left front, and about a third of the company was rallying\r\naround him.\r\n\r\nMy chum was a silent, sententious sort of a chap, and as we ran forward\r\nto the Captain’s line, he remarked earnestly:\r\n\r\n“Well: this beats hell!”\r\n\r\nI thought he had a clear idea of the situation.\r\n\r\nAll this occupied an inappreciably short space of time. The Rebels\r\nhad not stopped to reload, but were rushing impetuously toward us. We\r\ngave them a hot, rolling volley from our carbines. Many fell, more\r\nstopped to load and reply, but the mass surged straight forward at us.\r\nThen our fire grew so deadly that they showed a disposition to cover\r\nthemselves behind the rocks and trees. Again they were urged forward;\r\nand a body of them headed by their Colonel, mounted on a white horse,\r\npushed forward through the gap between us and the Second Lieutenant.\r\nThe Rebel Colonel dashed up to the Second Lieutenant, and ordered him\r\nto surrender. The latter-a gallant old graybeard--cursed the Rebel\r\nbitterly and snapped his now empty revolver in his face. The Colonel\r\nfired and killed him, whereupon his squad, with two of its Sergeants\r\nkilled and half its numbers on the ground, surrendered.\r\n\r\nThe Rebels in our front and flank pressed us with equal closeness. It\r\nseemed as if it was absolutely impossible to check their rush for an\r\ninstant, and as we saw the fate of our companions the Captain gave\r\nthe word for every man to look out for himself. We ran back a little\r\ndistance, sprang over the fence into the fields, and rushed toward\r\nTown, the Rebels encouraging us to make good time by a sharp fire into\r\nour backs from the fence.\r\n\r\nWhile we were vainly attempting to stem the onset of the column dashed\r\nagainst us, better success was secured elsewhere. Another column swept\r\ndown the other road, upon which there was only an outlying picket.\r\nThis had to come back on the run before the overwhelming numbers, and\r\nthe Rebels galloped straight for the three-inch Rodman. Company M was\r\nthe first to get saddled and mounted, and now came up at a steady,\r\nswinging gallop, in two platoons, saber and revolver in hand, and led\r\nby two Sergeants-Key and McWright,--printer boys from Bloomington,\r\nIllinois. They divined the object of the Rebel dash, and strained every\r\nnerve to reach the gun first. The Rebels were too near, and got the\r\ngun and turned it. Before they could fire it, Company M struck them\r\nheadlong, but they took the terrible impact without flinching, and\r\nfor a few minutes there was fierce hand-to-hand work, with sword and\r\npistol. The Rebel leader sank under a half-dozen simultaneous wounds,\r\nand fell dead almost under the gun. Men dropped from their horses each\r\ninstant, and the riderless steeds fled away. The scale of victory was\r\nturned by the Major dashing against the Rebel left flank at the head of\r\nCompany I, and a portion of the artillery squad. The Rebels gave ground\r\nslowly, and were packed into a dense mass in the lane up which they\r\nhad charged. After they had been crowded back, say fifty yards, word\r\nwas passed through our men to open to the right and left on the sides\r\nof the road. The artillerymen had turned the gun and loaded it with a\r\nsolid shot. Instantly a wide lane opened through our ranks; the man\r\nwith the lanyard drew the fatal cord, fire burst from the primer and\r\nthe muzzle, the long gun sprang up and recoiled, and there seemed to\r\nbe a demoniac yell in its ear-splitting crash, as the heavy ball left\r\nthe mouth, and tore its bloody way through the bodies of the struggling\r\nmass of men and horses.\r\n\r\nThis ended it. The Rebels gave way in disorder, and our men fell back\r\nto give the gun an opportunity to throw shell and canister.\r\n\r\nThe Rebels now saw that we were not to be run over like a field of\r\ncornstalks, and they fell back to devise further tactics, giving us a\r\nbreathing spell to get ourselves in shape for defense.\r\n\r\nThe dullest could see that we were in a desperate situation. Critical\r\npositions were no new experience to us, as they never are to a cavalry\r\ncommand after a few months in the field, but, though the pitcher goes\r\noften to the well, it is broken at last, and our time was evidently at\r\nhand. The narrow throat of the Valley, through which lay the road back\r\nto the Gap, was held by a force of Rebels evidently much superior to\r\nour own, and strongly posted. The road was a slender, tortuous one,\r\nwinding through rocks and gorges. Nowhere was there room enough to\r\nmove with even a platoon front against the enemy, and this precluded\r\nall chances of cutting out. The best we could do was a slow, difficult\r\nmovement, in column of fours, and this would have been suicide. On the\r\nother side of the Town the Rebels were massed stronger, while to the\r\nright and left rose the steep mountain sides. We were caught-trapped as\r\nsurely as a rat ever was in a wire trap.\r\n\r\nAs we learned afterwards, a whole division of cavalry, under command of\r\nthe noted Rebel, Major General Sam Jones, had been sent to effect our\r\ncapture, to offset in a measure Longstreet’s repulse at Knoxville. A\r\ngross overestimate of our numbers had caused the sending of so large a\r\nforce on this errand, and the rough treatment we gave the two columns\r\nthat attacked us first confirmed the Rebel General’s ideas of our\r\nstrength, and led him to adopt cautious tactics, instead of crushing us\r\nout speedily, by a determined advance of all parts of his encircling\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nThe lull in the fight did not last long. A portion of the Rebel line on\r\nthe east rushed forward to gain a more commanding position.\r\n\r\nWe concentrated in that direction and drove it back, the Rodman\r\nassisting with a couple of well-aimed shells.--This was followed by a\r\nsimilar but more successful attempt by another part of the Rebel line,\r\nand so it went on all day--the Rebels rushing up first on this side,\r\nand then on that, and we, hastily collecting at the exposed points,\r\nseeking to drive them back. We were frequently successful; we were on\r\nthe inside, and had the advantage of the short interior lines, so that\r\nour few men and our breech-loaders told to a good purpose.\r\n\r\nThere were frequent crises in the struggle, that at some times gave\r\nencouragement, but never hope. Once a determined onset was made\r\nfrom the East, and was met by the equally determined resistance of\r\nnearly our whole force. Our fire was so galling that a large number\r\nof our foes crowded into a house on a knoll, and making loopholes in\r\nits walls, began replying to us pretty sharply. We sent word to our\r\nfaithful artillerists, who trained the gun upon the house. The first\r\nshell screamed over the roof, and burst harmlessly beyond. We suspended\r\nfire to watch the next. It crashed through the side; for an instant\r\nall was deathly still; we thought it had gone on through. Then came a\r\nroar and a crash; the clapboards flew off the roof, and smoke poured\r\nout; panic-stricken Rebels rushed from the doors and sprang from the\r\nwindows--like bees from a disturbed hive; the shell had burst among\r\nthe confined mass of men inside! We afterwards heard that twenty-five\r\nwere killed there.\r\n\r\nAt another time a considerable force of rebels gained the cover of a\r\nfence in easy range of our main force. Companies L and K were ordered\r\nto charge forward on foot and dislodge them. Away we went, under a\r\nfire that seemed to drop a man at every step. A hundred yards in front\r\nof the Rebels was a little cover, and behind this our men lay down as\r\nif by one impulse. Then came a close, desperate duel at short range.\r\nIt was a question between Northern pluck and Southern courage, as to\r\nwhich could stand the most punishment. Lying as flat as possible on the\r\ncrusted snow, only raising the head or body enough to load and aim, the\r\nmen on both sides, with their teeth set, their glaring eyes fastened\r\non the foe, their nerves as tense as tightly-drawn steel wires, rained\r\nshot on each other as fast as excited hands could crowd cartridges into\r\nthe guns and discharge them.\r\n\r\nNot a word was said.\r\n\r\nThe shallower enthusiasm that expresses itself in oaths and shouts\r\nhad given way to the deep, voiceless rage of men in a death grapple.\r\nThe Rebel line was a rolling torrent of flame, their bullets shrieked\r\nangrily as they flew past, they struck the snow in front of us,\r\nand threw its cold flakes in faces that were white with the fires\r\nof consuming hate; they buried themselves with a dull thud in the\r\nquivering bodies of the enraged combatants.\r\n\r\nMinutes passed; they seemed hours.\r\n\r\nWould the villains, scoundrels, hell-hounds, sons of vipers never go?\r\n\r\nAt length a few Rebels sprang up and tried to fly. They were shot down\r\ninstantly.\r\n\r\nThen the whole line rose and ran!\r\n\r\nThe relief was so great that we jumped to our feet and cheered wildly,\r\nforgetting in our excitement to make use of our victory by shooting\r\ndown our flying enemies.\r\n\r\nNor was an element of fun lacking. A Second Lieutenant was ordered\r\nto take a party of skirmishers to the top of a hill and engage those\r\nof the Rebels stationed on another hill-top across a ravine. He had\r\nbut lately joined us from the Regular Army, where he was a Drill\r\nSergeant. Naturally, he was very methodical in his way, and scorned\r\nto do otherwise under fire than he would upon the parade ground. He\r\nmoved his little command to the hill-top, in close order, and faced\r\nthem to the front. The Johnnies received them with a yell and a volley,\r\nwhereat the boys winced a little, much to the Lieutenant’s disgust, who\r\nswore at them; then had them count off with great deliberation, and\r\ndeployed them as coolly as if them was not an enemy within a hundred\r\nmiles. After the line deployed, he “dressed” it, commanded “Front!” and\r\n“Begin, firing!” his attention was called another way for an instant,\r\nand when he looked back again, there was not a man of his nicely formed\r\nskirmish line visible. The logs and stones had evidently been put there\r\nfor the use of skirmishers, the boys thought, and in an instant they\r\navailed themselves of their shelter.\r\n\r\nNever was there an angrier man than that Second Lieutenant; he\r\nbrandished his saber and swore; he seemed to feel that all his\r\nsoldierly reputation was gone, but the boys stuck to their shelter for\r\nall that, informing him that when the Rebels would stand out in the\r\nopen field and take their fire, they would likewise.\r\n\r\nDespite all our efforts, the Rebel line crawled up closer an closer to\r\nus; we were driven back from knoll to knoll, and from one fence after\r\nanother. We had maintained the unequal struggle for eight hours; over\r\none-fourth of our number were stretched upon the snow, killed or badly\r\nwounded. Our cartridges were nearly all gone; the cannon had fired its\r\nlast shot long ago, and having a blank cartridge left, had shot the\r\nrammer at a gathering party of the enemy.\r\n\r\nJust as the Winter sun was going down upon a day of gloom the bugle\r\ncalled us all up on the hillside. Then the Rebels saw for the first\r\ntime how few there were, and began an almost simultaneous charge all\r\nalong the line. The Major raised piece of a shelter tent upon a pole.\r\nThe line halted. An officer rode out from it, followed by two privates.\r\n\r\nApproaching the Major, he said, “Who is in command this force?”\r\n\r\nThe Major replied: “I am.”\r\n\r\n“Then, Sir, I demand your sword.”\r\n\r\n“What is your rank, Sir!”\r\n\r\n“I am Adjutant of the Sixty-fourth Virginia.”\r\n\r\nThe punctillious soul of the old “Regular”--for such the Major was\r\nswelled up instantly, and he answered:\r\n\r\n“By ---, sir, I will never surrender to my inferior in rank!”\r\n\r\nThe Adjutant reined his horse back. His two followers leveled their\r\npieces at the Major and waited orders to fire. They were covered by a\r\ndozen carbines in the hands of our men. The Adjutant ordered his men to\r\n“recover arms,” and rode away with them. He presently returned with a\r\nColonel, and to him the Major handed his saber.\r\n\r\nAs the men realized what was being done, the first thought of many\r\nof them was to snatch out the cylinder’s of their revolvers, and the\r\nslides of their carbines, and throw them away, so as to make the arms\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\nWe were overcome with rage and humiliation at being compelled to yield\r\nto an enemy whom we had hated so bitterly. As we stood there on the\r\nbleak mountain-side, the biting wind soughing through the leafless\r\nbranches, the shadows of a gloomy winter night closing around us, the\r\ngroans and shrieks of our wounded mingling with the triumphant yells of\r\nthe Rebels plundering our tents, it seemed as if Fate could press to\r\nman’s lips no cup with bitterer dregs in it than this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE REACTION--DEPRESSION--BITTING COLD--SHARP HUNGER AND SAD REFLEXION.\r\n\r\n          “Of being taken by the Insolent foe.”--Othello.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night that followed was inexpressibly dreary: The high-wrought\r\nnervous tension, which had been protracted through the long hours\r\nthat the fight lasted, was succeeded by a proportionate mental\r\ndepression, such as naturally follows any strain upon the mind.\r\nThis was intensified in our cases by the sharp sting of defeat, the\r\nhumiliation of having to yield ourselves, our horses and our arms into\r\nthe possession of the enemy, the uncertainty as to the future, and the\r\nsorrow we felt at the loss of so many of our comrades.\r\n\r\nCompany L had suffered very severely, but our chief regret was for the\r\ngallant Osgood, our Second Lieutenant. He, above all others, was our\r\ntrusted leader. The Captain and First Lieutenant were brave men, and\r\ngood enough soldiers, but Osgood was the one “whose adoption tried,\r\nwe grappled to our souls with hooks of steel.” There was never any\r\ndifficulty in getting all the volunteers he wanted for a scouting\r\nparty. A quiet, pleasant spoken gentleman, past middle age, he looked\r\nmuch better fitted for the office of Justice of the Peace, to which\r\nhis fellow-citizens of Urbana, Illinois, had elected and reelected\r\nhim, than to command a troop of rough riders in a great civil war. But\r\nnone more gallant than he ever vaulted into saddle to do battle for\r\nthe right. He went into the Army solely as a matter of principle, and\r\ndid his duty with the unflagging zeal of an olden Puritan fighting for\r\nliberty and his soul’s salvation. He was a superb horseman--as all the\r\nolder Illinoisans are and, for all his two-score years and ten, he\r\nrecognized few superiors for strength and activity in the Battalion. A\r\nradical, uncompromising Abolitionist, he had frequently asserted that\r\nhe would rather die than yield to a Rebel, and he kept his word in this\r\nas in everything else.\r\n\r\nAs for him, it was probably the way he desired to die. No one believed\r\nmore ardently than he that\r\n\r\n               Whether on the scaffold high,\r\n               Or in the battle’s van;\r\n               The fittest place for man to die,\r\n               Is where he dies for man.\r\n\r\nAmong the many who had lost chums and friends was Ned Johnson, of\r\nCompany K. Ned was a young Englishman, with much of the suggestiveness\r\nof the bull-dog common to the lower class of that nation. His fist was\r\nreadier than his tongue. His chum, Walter Savage was of the same surly\r\ntype. The two had come from England twelve years before, and had been\r\ntogether ever since. Savage was killed in the struggle for the fence\r\ndescribed in the preceding chapter. Ned could not realize for a while\r\nthat his friend was dead. It was only when the body rapidly stiffened\r\non its icy bed, and the eyes which had been gleaming deadly hate when\r\nhe was stricken down were glazed over with the dull film of death, that\r\nhe believed he was gone from him forever. Then his rage was terrible.\r\nFor the rest of the day he was at the head of every assault upon the\r\nenemy. His voice could ever be heard above the firing, cursing the\r\nRebels bitterly, and urging the boys to “Stand up to ’em! Stand right\r\nup to ’em! Don’t give a inch! Let them have the best you got in the\r\nshop! Shoot low, and don’t waste a cartridge!”\r\n\r\nWhen we surrendered, Ned seemed to yield sullenly to the inevitable.\r\nHe threw his belt and apparently his revolver with it upon the snow. A\r\nguard was formed around us, and we gathered about the fires that were\r\nstarted. Ned sat apart, his arms folded, his head upon his breast,\r\nbrooding bitterly upon Walter’s death. A horseman, evidently a Colonel\r\nor General, clattered up to give some directions concerning us. At the\r\nsound of his voice Ned raised his head and gave him a swift glance;\r\nthe gold stars upon the Rebel’s collar led him to believe that he was\r\nthe commander of the enemy. Ned sprang to his feet, made a long stride\r\nforward, snatched from the breast of his overcoat the revolver he had\r\nbeen hiding there, cocked it and leveled it at the Rebel’s breast.\r\nBefore he could pull the trigger Orderly Sergeant Charles Bentley, of\r\nhis Company, who was watching him, leaped forward, caught his wrist\r\nand threw the revolver up. Others joined in, took the weapon away, and\r\nhanded it over to the officer, who then ordered us all to be searched\r\nfor arms, and rode away.\r\n\r\nAll our dejection could not make us forget that we were intensely\r\nhungry. We had eaten nothing all day. The fight began before we had\r\ntime to get any breakfast, and of course there was no interval for\r\nrefreshments during the engagement. The Rebels were no better off than\r\nwe, having been marched rapidly all night in order to come upon us by\r\ndaylight.\r\n\r\nLate in the evening a few sacks of meal were given us, and we took the\r\nfirst lesson in an art that long and painful practice afterward was to\r\nmake very familiar to us. We had nothing to mix the meal in, and it\r\nlooked as if we would have to eat it dry, until a happy thought struck\r\nsome one that our caps would do for kneading troughs. At once every\r\ncap was devoted to this. Getting water from an adjacent spring, each\r\nman made a little wad of dough--unsalted--and spreading it upon a flat\r\nstone or a chip, set it up in front of the fire to bake. As soon as it\r\nwas browned on one side, it was pulled off the stone, and the other\r\nside turned to the fire. It was a very primitive way of cooking and I\r\nbecame thoroughly disgusted with it. It was fortunate for me that I\r\nlittle dreamed that this was the way I should have to get my meals for\r\nthe next fifteen months.\r\n\r\nAfter somewhat of the edge had been taken off our hunger by this food,\r\nwe crouched around the fires, talked over the events of the day,\r\nspeculated as to what was to be done with us, and snatched such sleep\r\nas the biting cold would permit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n“ON TO RICHMOND!”--MARCHING ON FOOT OVER THE MOUNTAINS--MY HORSE HAS A\r\nNEW RIDER--UNSOPHISTICATED MOUNTAIN GIRLS--DISCUSSING THE ISSUES OF THE\r\nWAR--PARTING WITH “HIATOGA.”\r\n\r\nAt dawn we were gathered together, more meal issued to us, which we\r\ncooked in the same way, and then were started under heavy guard to\r\nmarch on foot over the mountains to Bristol, a station at the point\r\nwhere the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad crosses the line between\r\nVirginia and Tennessee.\r\n\r\nAs we were preparing to set out a Sergeant of the First Virginia\r\ncavalry came galloping up to us on my horse! The sight of my faithful\r\n“Hiatoga” bestrid by a Rebel, wrung my heart. During the action I had\r\nforgotten him, but when it ceased I began to worry about his fate. As\r\nhe and his rider came near I called out to him; he stopped and gave\r\na whinny of recognition, which seemed also a plaintive appeal for an\r\nexplanation of the changed condition of affairs.\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant was a pleasant, gentlemanly boy of about my own age. He\r\nrode up to me and inquired if it was my horse, to which I replied in\r\nthe affirmative, and asked permission to take from the saddle pockets\r\nsome letters, pictures and other trinkets. He granted this, and we\r\nbecame friends from thence on until we separated. He rode by my side as\r\nwe plodded over the steep, slippery hills, and we beguiled the way by\r\nchatting of the thousand things that soldiers find to talk about, and\r\nexchanged reminiscences of the service on both sides. But the subject\r\nhe was fondest of was that which I relished least: my--now his--horse.\r\nInto the open ulcer of my heart he poured the acid of all manner of\r\nquestions concerning my lost steed’s qualities and capabilities: would\r\nhe swim? how was he in fording? did he jump well! how did he stand\r\nfire? I smothered my irritation, and answered as pleasantly as I could.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of the third day after the capture, we came up to\r\nwhere a party of rustic belles were collected at “quilting.” The\r\n“Yankees” were instantly objects of greater interest than the parade of\r\na menagerie would have been. The Sergeant told the girls we were going\r\nto camp for the night a mile or so ahead, and if they would be at a\r\ncertain house, he would have a Yankee for them for close inspection.\r\nAfter halting, the Sergeant obtained leave to take me out with a\r\nguard, and I was presently ushered into a room in which the damsels\r\nwere massed in force, --a carnation-checked, staring, open-mouthed,\r\nlinsey-clad crowd, as ignorant of corsets and gloves as of Hebrew, and\r\nwith a propensity to giggle that was chronic and irrepressible. When\r\nwe entered the room there was a general giggle, and then a shower of\r\ncomments upon my appearance,--each sentence punctuated with the chorus\r\nof feminine cachination. A remark was made about my hair and eyes, and\r\ntheir risibles gave way; judgment was passed on my nose, and then came\r\na ripple of laughter. I got very red in the face, and uncomfortable\r\ngenerally. Attention was called to the size of my feet and hands, and\r\nthe usual chorus followed. Those useful members of my body seemed to\r\nswell up as they do to a young man at his first party.\r\n\r\nThen I saw that in the minds of these bucolic maidens I was scarcely,\r\nif at all, human; they did not understand that I belonged to the\r\nrace; I was a “Yankee”--a something of the non-human class, as the\r\ngorilla or the chimpanzee. They felt as free to discuss my points\r\nbefore my face as they would to talk of a horse or a wild animal in a\r\nshow. My equanimity was partially restored by this reflection, but I\r\nwas still too young to escape embarrassment and irritation at being\r\nthus dissected and giggled at by a party of girls, even if they were\r\nignorant Virginia mountaineers.\r\n\r\nI turned around to speak to the Sergeant, and in so doing showed my\r\nback to the ladies. The hum of comment deepened into surprise, that\r\nhalf stopped and then intensified the giggle.\r\n\r\nI was puzzled for a minute, and then the direction of their glances,\r\nand their remarks explained it all. At the rear of the lower part of\r\nthe cavalry jacket, about where the upper ornamental buttons are on\r\nthe tail of a frock coat, are two funny tabs, about the size of small\r\npin-cushions. They are fastened by the edge, and stick out straight\r\nbehind. Their use is to support the heavy belt in the rear, as the\r\nbuttons do in front. When the belt is off it would puzzle the Seven\r\nWise Men to guess what they are for. The unsophisticated young ladies,\r\nwith that swift intuition which is one of lovely woman’s salient mental\r\ntraits, immediately jumped at the conclusion that the projections\r\ncovered some peculiar conformation of the Yankee anatomy--some\r\nincipient, dromedary-like humps, or perchance the horns of which they\r\nhad heard so much.\r\n\r\nThis anatomical phenomena was discussed intently for a few minutes,\r\nduring which I heard one of the girls inquire whether “it would hurt\r\nhim to cut ’em off?” and another hazarded the opinion that “it would\r\nprobably bleed him to death.”\r\n\r\nThen a new idea seized them, and they said to the Sergeant “Make him\r\nsing! Make him sing!”\r\n\r\nThis was too much for the Sergeant, who had been intensely amused at\r\nthe girls’ wonderment. He turned to me, very red in the face, with:\r\n\r\n“Sergeant: the girls want to hear you sing.”\r\n\r\nI replied that I could not sing a note. Said he:\r\n\r\n“Oh, come now. I know better than that; I never seed or heerd of a\r\nYankee that couldn’t sing.”\r\n\r\nI nevertheless assured him that there really were some Yankees that\r\ndid not have any musical accomplishments, and that I was one of that\r\nunfortunate number. I asked him to get the ladies to sing for me, and\r\nto this they acceded quite readily. One girl, with a fair soprano, who\r\nseemed to be the leader of the crowd, sang “The Homespun Dress,” a song\r\nvery popular in the South, and having the same tune as the “Bonnie Blue\r\nFlag.” It began,\r\n\r\n               I envy not the Northern girl\r\n               Their silks and jewels fine,\r\n\r\nand proceeded to compare the homespun habiliments of the Southern women\r\nto the finery and frippery of the ladies on the other side of Mason and\r\nDixon’s line in a manner very disadvantageous to the latter.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the girls made a fine exhibition of the lung-power acquired\r\nin climbing their precipitous mountains, when they came in on the chorus\r\n\r\n               Hurra! Hurra! for southern rights Hurra!\r\n               Hurra for the homespun dress,\r\n               The Southern ladies wear.\r\n\r\nThis ended the entertainment.\r\n\r\nOn our journey to Bristol we met many Rebel soldiers, of all ranks, and\r\na small number of citizens. As the conscription had then been enforced\r\npretty sharply for over a year the only able-bodied men seen in civil\r\nlife were those who had some trade which exempted them from being\r\nforced into active service. It greatly astonished us at first to find\r\nthat nearly all the mechanics were included among the exempts, or could\r\nbe if they chose; but a very little reflection showed us the wisdom of\r\nsuch a policy. The South is as nearly a purely agricultural country\r\nas is Russia or South America. The people have, little inclination\r\nor capacity for anything else than pastoral pursuits. Consequently\r\nmechanics are very scarce, and manufactories much scarcer. The limited\r\nquantity of products of mechanical skill needed by the people was\r\nmostly imported from the North or Europe. Both these sources of supply\r\nwere cutoff by the war, and the country was thrown upon its own slender\r\nmanufacturing resources. To force its mechanics into the army would\r\ntherefore be suicidal. The Army would gain a few thousand men, but its\r\noperations would be embarrassed, if not stopped altogether, by a want\r\nof supplies. This condition of affairs reminded one of the singular\r\npaucity of mechanical skill among the Bedouins of the desert, which\r\nrenders the life of a blacksmith sacred. No matter how bitter the feud\r\nbetween tribes, no one will kill the other’s workers of iron, and\r\ninstances are told of warriors saving their lives at critical periods\r\nby falling on their knees and making with their garments an imitation\r\nof the action of a smith’s bellows.\r\n\r\nAll whom we met were eager to discuss with us the causes, phases and\r\nprogress of the war, and whenever opportunity offered or could be\r\nmade, those of us who were inclined to talk were speedily involved in\r\nan argument with crowds of soldiers and citizens. But, owing to the\r\npolemic poverty of our opponents, the argument was more in name than\r\nin fact. Like all people of slender or untrained intellectual powers\r\nthey labored under the hallucination that asserting was reasoning, and\r\nthe emphatic reiteration of bald statements, logic. The narrow round\r\nwhich all from highest to lowest--traveled was sometimes comical, and\r\nsometimes irritating, according to one’s mood! The dispute invariably\r\nbegan by their asking:\r\n\r\n“Well, what are you ’uns down here a-fightin’ we ’uns for?”\r\n\r\nAs this was replied to the newt one followed:\r\n\r\n“Why are you’uns takin’ our niggers away from we ’uns for?”\r\n\r\nThen came:\r\n\r\n“What do you ’uns put our niggers to fightin’ we’uns for?” The windup\r\nalways was: “Well, let me tell you, sir, you can never whip people that\r\nare fighting for liberty, sir.”\r\n\r\nEven General Giltner, who had achieved considerable military reputation\r\nas commander of a division of Kentucky cavalry, seemed to be as\r\nslenderly furnished with logical ammunition as the balance, for as he\r\nhalted by us he opened the conversation with the well-worn formula:\r\n\r\n“Well: what are you ’uns down here a-fighting we’uns for?”\r\n\r\nThe question had become raspingly monotonous to me, whom he addressed,\r\nand I replied with marked acerbity:\r\n\r\n“Because we are the Northern mudsills whom you affect to despise, and\r\nwe came down here to lick you into respecting us.”\r\n\r\nThe answer seemed to tickle him, a pleasanter light came into his\r\nsinister gray eyes, he laughed lightly, and bade us a kindly good day.\r\n\r\nFour days after our capture we arrived in Bristol. The guards who had\r\nbrought us over the mountains were relieved by others, the Sergeant\r\nbade me good by, struck his spurs into “Hiatoga’s” sides, and he and my\r\nfaithful horse were soon lost to view in the darkness.\r\n\r\nA new and keener sense of desolation came over me at the final\r\nseparation from my tried and true four-footed friend, who had been\r\nmy constant companion through so many perils and hardships. We had\r\nendured together the Winter’s cold, the dispiriting drench of the rain,\r\nthe fatigue of the long march, the discomforts of the muddy camp, the\r\ngripings of hunger, the weariness of the drill and review, the perils\r\nof the vidette post, the courier service, the scout and the fight. We\r\nhad shared in common\r\n\r\n               The whips and scorns of time,\r\n               The oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,\r\n               The insolence of office, and the spurns\r\n\r\nwhich a patient private and his horse of the unworthy take; we had had\r\nour frequently recurring rows with other fellows and their horses, over\r\nquestions of precedence at watering places, and grass-plots, had had\r\nlively tilts with guards of forage piles in surreptitious attempts to\r\nget additional rations, sometimes coming off victorious and sometimes\r\nbeing driven off ingloriously. I had often gone hungry that he might\r\nhave the only ear of corn obtainable. I am not skilled enough in horse\r\nlore to speak of his points or pedigree. I only know that his strong\r\nlimbs never failed me, and that he was always ready for duty and ever\r\nwilling.\r\n\r\nNow at last our paths diverged. I was retired from actual service to\r\na prison, and he bore his new master off to battle against his old\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n               ...........................\r\n\r\nPacked closely in old, dilapidated stock and box cars, as if cattle\r\nin shipment to market, we pounded along slowly, and apparently\r\ninterminably, toward the Rebel capital.\r\n\r\nThe railroads of the South were already in very bad condition. They\r\nwere never more than passably good, even in their best estate, but now,\r\nwith a large part of the skilled men engaged upon them escaped back to\r\nthe North, with all renewal, improvement, or any but the most necessary\r\nrepairs stopped for three years, and with a marked absence of even\r\nordinary skill and care in their management, they were as nearly ruined\r\nas they could well be and still run.\r\n\r\nOne of the severe embarrassments under which the roads labored was\r\na lack of oil. There is very little fatty matter of any kind in the\r\nSouth. The climate and the food plants do not favor the accumulation of\r\nadipose tissue by animals, and there is no other source of supply. Lard\r\noil and tallow were very scarce and held at exorbitant prices.\r\n\r\nAttempts were made to obtain lubricants from the peanut and the cotton\r\nseed. The first yielded a fine bland oil, resembling the ordinary grade\r\nof olive oil, but it was entirely too expensive for use in the arts.\r\nThe cotton seed oil could be produced much cheaper, but it had in it\r\nsuch a quantity of gummy matter as to render it worse than useless for\r\nemployment on machinery.\r\n\r\nThis scarcity of oleaginous matter produced a corresponding scarcity of\r\nsoap and similar detergents, but this was a deprivation which caused\r\nthe Rebels, as a whole, as little inconvenience as any that they\r\nsuffered from. I have seen many thousands of them who were obviously\r\ngreatly in need of soap, but if they were rent with any suffering on\r\nthat account they concealed it with marvelous self-control.\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be a scanty supply of oil provided for the locomotives,\r\nbut the cars had to run with unlubricated axles, and the screaking and\r\ngroaning of the grinding journals in the dry boxes was sometimes almost\r\ndeafening, especially when we were going around a curve.\r\n\r\nOur engine went off the wretched track several times, but as she was\r\nnot running much faster than a man could walk, the worst consequence to\r\nus was a severe jolting. She was small, and was easily pried back upon\r\nthe track, and sent again upon her wheezy, straining way.\r\n\r\nThe depression which had weighed us down for a night and a day after\r\nour capture had now been succeeded by a more cheerful feeling. We began\r\nto look upon our condition as the fortune of war. We were proud of our\r\nresistance to overwhelming numbers. We knew we had sold ourselves at a\r\nprice which, if the Rebels had it to do over again, they would not pay\r\nfor us. We believed that we had killed and seriously wounded as many\r\nof them as they had killed, wounded and captured of us. We had nothing\r\nto blame ourselves for. Moreover, we began to be buoyed up with the\r\nexpectation that we would be exchanged immediately upon our arrival at\r\nRichmond, and the Rebel officers confidently assured us that this would\r\nbe so. There was then a temporary hitch in the exchange, but it would\r\nall be straightened out in a few days, and it might not be a month\r\nuntil we were again marching out of Cumberland Gap, on an avenging\r\nforay against some of the force which had assisted in our capture.\r\n\r\nFortunately for this delusive hopefulness there was no weird and boding\r\nCassandra to pierce the veil of the future for us, and reveal the\r\nlength and the ghastly horror of the Valley of the Shadow of Death,\r\nthrough which we must pass for hundreds of sad days, stretching out\r\ninto long months of suffering and death. Happily there was no one to\r\ntell us that of every five in that party four would never stand under\r\nthe Stars and Stripes again, but succumbing to chronic starvation,\r\nlong-continued exposure, the bullet of the brutal guard, the loathsome\r\nscurvy, the hideous gangrene, and the heartsickness of hope deferred,\r\nwould find respite from pain low in the barren sands of that hungry\r\nSouthern soil.\r\n\r\nWere every doom foretokened by appropriate omens, the ravens along our\r\nroute would have croaked themselves hoarse.\r\n\r\nBut, far from being oppressed by any presentiment of coming evil, we\r\nbegan to appreciate and enjoy the picturesque grandeur of the scenery\r\nthrough which we were moving. The rugged sternness of the Appalachian\r\nmountain range, in whose rock-ribbed heart we had fought our losing\r\nfight, was now softening into less strong, but more graceful outlines\r\nas we approached the pine-clad, sandy plains of the seaboard, upon\r\nwhich Richmond is built. We were skirting along the eastern base of\r\nthe great Blue Ridge, about whose distant and lofty summits hung a\r\nperpetual veil of deep, dark, but translucent blue, which refracted the\r\nslanting rays of the morning and evening sun into masses of color more\r\ngorgeous than a dreamer’s vision of an enchanted land. At Lynchburg\r\nwe saw the famed Peaks of Otter--twenty miles away--lifting their\r\nproud heads far into the clouds, like giant watch-towers sentineling\r\nthe gateway that the mighty waters of the James had forced through\r\nthe barriers of solid adamant lying across their path to the far-off\r\nsea. What we had seen many miles back start from the mountain sides\r\nas slender rivulets, brawling over the worn boulders, were now great,\r\nrushing, full-tide streams, enough of them in any fifty miles of our\r\njourney to furnish water power for all the factories of New England.\r\nTheir amazing opulence of mechanical energy has lain unutilized, almost\r\nunnoticed; in the two and one-half centuries that the white man has\r\ndwelt near them, while in Massachusetts and her near neighbors every\r\nrill that can turn a wheel has been put into harness and forced to do\r\nits share of labor for the benefit of the men who have made themselves\r\nits masters.\r\n\r\nHere is one of the differences between the two sections: In the North\r\nman was set free, and the elements made to do his work. In the South\r\nman was the degraded slave, and the elements wantoned on in undisturbed\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nAs we went on, the Valleys of the James and the Appomattox, down which\r\nour way lay, broadened into an expanse of arable acres, and the faces\r\nof those streams were frequently flecked by gem-like little islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nENTERING RICHMOND--DISAPPOINTMENT AT ITS APPEARANCE--EVERYBODY IN\r\nUNIFORM--CURLED DARLINGS OF THE CAPITAL--THE REBEL FLAG--LIBBY PRISON\r\n--DICK TURNER--SEARCHING THE NEW COMERS.\r\n\r\nEarly on the tenth morning after our capture we were told that we were\r\nabout to enter Richmond. Instantly all were keenly observant of every\r\ndetail in the surroundings of a City that was then the object of the\r\nhopes and fears of thirty-five millions of people--a City assailing\r\nwhich seventy-five thousand brave men had already laid down their\r\nlives, defending which an equal number had died, and which, before\r\nit fell, was to cost the life blood of another one hundred and fifty\r\nthousand valiant assailants and defenders.\r\n\r\nSo much had been said and written about Richmond that our boyish\r\nminds had wrought up the most extravagant expectations of it and its\r\ndefenses. We anticipated seeing a City differing widely from anything\r\never seen before; some anomaly of nature displayed in its site, itself\r\nguarded by imposing and impregnable fortifications, with powerful forts\r\nand heavy guns, perhaps even walls, castles, postern gates, moats and\r\nditches, and all the other panoply of defensive warfare, with which\r\nromantic history had made us familiar.\r\n\r\nWe were disappointed--badly disappointed--in seeing nothing of this\r\nas we slowly rolled along. The spires and the tall chimneys of the\r\nfactories rose in the distance very much as they had in other Cities\r\nwe had visited. We passed a single line of breastworks of bare yellow\r\nsand, but the scrubby pines in front were not cut away, and there were\r\nno signs that there had ever been any immediate expectation of use\r\nfor the works. A redoubt or two--without guns--could be made out, and\r\nthis was all. Grim-visaged war had few wrinkles on his front in that\r\nneighborhood. They were then seaming his brow on the Rappahannock,\r\nseventy miles away, where the Army of Northern Virginia and the Army of\r\nthe Potomac lay confronting each other.\r\n\r\nAt one of the stopping places I had been separated from my companions\r\nby entering a car in which were a number of East Tennesseeans, captured\r\nin the operations around Knoxville, and whom the Rebels, in accordance\r\nwith their usual custom, were treating with studied contumely. I had\r\nalways had a very warm side for these simple rustics of the mountains\r\nand valleys. I knew much of their unwavering fidelity to the Union, of\r\nthe firm steadfastness with which they endured persecution for their\r\ncountry’s sake, and made sacrifices even unto death; and, as in those\r\ndays I estimated all men simply by their devotion to the great cause\r\nof National integrity, (a habit that still clings to me) I rated these\r\nmen very highly. I had gone into their car to do my little to encourage\r\nthem, and when I attempted to return to my own I was prevented by the\r\nguard.\r\n\r\nCrossing the long bridge, our train came to a halt on the other side\r\nof the river with the usual clamor of bell and whistle, the usual\r\nseemingly purposeless and vacillating, almost dizzying, running\r\nbackward and forward on a network of sidetracks and switches, that\r\nseemed unavoidably necessary, a dozen years ago, in getting a train\r\ninto a City.\r\n\r\nStill unable to regain my comrades and share their fortunes, I was\r\nmarched off with the Tennesseeans through the City to the office of\r\nsome one who had charge of the prisoners of war.\r\n\r\nThe streets we passed through were lined with retail stores, in which\r\nbusiness was being carried on very much as in peaceful times. Many\r\npeople were on the streets, but the greater part of the men wore some\r\nsort of a uniform. Though numbers of these were in active service, yet\r\nthe wearing of a military garb did not necessarily imply this. Nearly\r\nevery able-bodied man in Richmond was; enrolled in some sort of an\r\norganization, and armed, and drilled regularly. Even the members of the\r\nConfederate Congress were uniformed and attached, in theory at least,\r\nto the Home Guards.\r\n\r\nIt was obvious even to the casual glimpse of a passing prisoner of war,\r\nthat the City did not lack its full share of the class which formed\r\nso large an element of the society of Washington and other Northern\r\nCities during the war--the dainty carpet soldiers, heros of the\r\npromenade and the boudoir, who strutted in uniforms when the enemy was\r\nfar off, and wore citizen’s clothes when he was close at hand. There\r\nwere many curled darlings displaying their fine forms in the nattiest\r\nof uniforms, whose gloss had never suffered from so much as a heavy\r\ndew, let alone a rainy day on the march. The Confederate gray could be\r\nmade into a very dressy garb. With the sleeves lavishly embroidered\r\nwith gold lace, and the collar decorated with stars indicating the\r\nwearer’s rank--silver for the field officers, and gold for the higher\r\ngrade,--the feet compressed into high-heeled, high-instepped boots,\r\n(no Virginian is himself without a fine pair of skin-tight boots)\r\nand the head covered with a fine, soft, broad-brimmed hat, trimmed\r\nwith a gold cord, from which a bullion tassel dangled several inches\r\ndown the wearer’s back, you had a military swell, caparisoned for\r\nconquest--among the fair sex.\r\n\r\nOn our way we passed the noted Capitol of Virginia--a handsome marble\r\nbuilding,--of the column-fronted Grecian temple style. It stands\r\nin the center of the City. Upon the grounds is Crawford’s famous\r\nequestrian statue of Washington, surrounded by smaller statues of other\r\nRevolutionary patriots.\r\n\r\nThe Confederate Congress was then in session in the Capitol, and also\r\nthe Legislature of Virginia, a fact indicated by the State flag of\r\nVirginia floating from the southern end of the building, and the new\r\nflag of the Confederacy from the northern end. This was the first time\r\nI had seen the latter, which had been recently adopted, and I examined\r\nit with some interest. The design was exceedingly plain. Simply a white\r\nbanner, with a red field in the corner where the blue field with stars\r\nis in ours. The two blue stripes were drawn diagonally across this\r\nfield in the shape of a letter X, and in these were thirteen white\r\nstars, corresponding to the number of States claimed to be in the\r\nConfederacy.\r\n\r\nThe battle-flag was simply the red field. My examination of all this\r\nwas necessarily very brief. The guards felt that I was in Richmond\r\nfor other purposes than to study architecture, statuary and heraldry,\r\nand besides they were in a hurry to be relieved of us and get their\r\nbreakfast, so my art-education was abbreviated sharply.\r\n\r\nWe did not excite much attention on the streets. Prisoners had by that\r\ntime become too common in Richmond to create any interest. Occasionally\r\npassers by would fling opprobrious epithets at “the East Tennessee\r\ntraitors,” but that was all.\r\n\r\nThe commandant of the prisons directed the Tennesseeans to be taken to\r\nCastle Lightning--a prison used to confine the Rebel deserters, among\r\nwhom they also classed the East Tennesseeans, and sometimes the West\r\nVirginians, Kentuckians, Marylanders and Missourians found fighting\r\nagainst them. Such of our men as deserted to them were also lodged\r\nthere, as the Rebels, very properly, did not place a high estimate upon\r\nthis class of recruits to their army, and, as we shall see farther\r\nalong, violated all obligations of good faith with them, by putting\r\nthem among the regular prisoners of war, so as to exchange them for\r\ntheir own men.\r\n\r\nBack we were all marched to a street which ran parallel to the river\r\nand canal, and but one square away from them. It was lined on both\r\nsides by plain brick warehouses and tobacco factories, four and five\r\nstories high, which were now used by the Rebel Government as prisons\r\nand military storehouses.\r\n\r\nThe first we passed was Castle Thunder, of bloody repute. This occupied\r\nthe same place in Confederate history, that, the dungeons beneath the\r\nlevel of the water did in the annals of the Venetian Council of Ten. It\r\nwas believed that if the bricks in its somber, dirt-grimed walls could\r\nspeak, each could tell a separate story of a life deemed dangerous to\r\nthe State that had gone down in night, at the behest of the ruthless\r\nConfederate authorities. It was confidently asserted that among the\r\ncommoner occurrences within its confines was the stationing of a doomed\r\nprisoner against a certain bit of blood-stained, bullet-chipped wall,\r\nand relieving the Confederacy of all farther fear of him by the rifles\r\nof a firing party. How well this dark reputation was deserved, no one\r\nbut those inside the inner circle of the Davis Government can say. It\r\nis safe to believe that more tragedies were enacted there than the\r\narchives of the Rebel civil or military judicature give any account of.\r\nThe prison was employed for the detention of spies, and those charged\r\nwith the convenient allegation of “treason against the Confederate\r\nStates of America.” It is probable that many of these were sent out\r\nof the world with as little respect for the formalities of law as was\r\nexhibited with regard to the ‘suspects’ during the French Revolution.\r\n\r\nNext we came to Castle Lightning, and here I bade adieu to my Tennessee\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nA few squares more and we arrived at a warehouse larger than any of the\r\nothers. Over the door was a sign\r\n\r\n                    THOMAS LIBBY & SON,\r\n                 SHIP CHANDLERS AND GROCERS.\r\n\r\nThis was the notorious “Libby Prison,” whose name was painfully\r\nfamiliar to every Union man in the land. Under the sign was a broad\r\nentrance way, large enough to admit a dray or a small wagon. On one\r\nside of this was the prison office, in which were a number of dapper,\r\nfeeble-faced clerks at work on the prison records.\r\n\r\nAs I entered this space a squad of newly arrived prisoners were being\r\nsearched for valuables, and having their names, rank and regiment\r\nrecorded in the books. Presently a clerk addressed as “Majah Tunnah,”\r\nthe man who was superintending these operations, and I scanned him\r\nwith increased interest, as I knew then that he was the ill-famed Dick\r\nTurner, hated all over the North for his brutality to our prisoners.\r\n\r\nHe looked as if he deserved his reputation. Seen upon the street he\r\nwould be taken for a second or third class gambler, one in whom a\r\ncertain amount of cunning is pieced out by a readiness to use brute\r\nforce. His face, clean-shaved, except a “Bowery-b’hoy” goatee, was\r\nwhite, fat, and selfishly sensual. Small, pig-like eyes, set close\r\ntogether, glanced around continually. His legs were short, his body\r\nlong, and made to appear longer, by his wearing no vest--a custom\r\ncommon them with Southerners.\r\n\r\nHis faculties were at that moment absorbed in seeing that no person\r\nconcealed any money from him. His subordinates did not search closely\r\nenough to suit him, and he would run his fat, heavily-ringed fingers\r\nthrough the prisoner’s hair, feel under their arms and elsewhere where\r\nhe thought a stray five dollar greenback might be concealed. But with\r\nall his greedy care he was no match for Yankee cunning. The prisoners\r\ntold me afterward that, suspecting they would be searched, they had\r\ntaken off the caps of the large, hollow brass buttons of their coats,\r\ncarefully folded a bill into each cavity, and replaced the cap. In this\r\nway they brought in several hundred dollars safely.\r\n\r\nThere was one dirty old Englishman in the party, who, Turner was\r\nconvinced, had money concealed about his person. He compelled him to\r\nstrip off everything, and stand shivering in the sharp cold, while he\r\ntook up one filthy rag after another, felt over each carefully, and\r\nscrutinized each seam and fold. I was delighted to see that after all\r\nhis nauseating work he did not find so much as a five cent piece.\r\n\r\nIt came my turn. I had no desire, in that frigid atmosphere, to strip\r\ndown to what Artemus Ward called “the skanderlous costoom of the Greek\r\nSlave;” so I pulled out of my pocket my little store of wealth--ten\r\ndollars in greenbacks, sixty dollars in Confederate graybacks--and\r\ndisplayed it as Turner came up with, “There’s all I have, sir.” Turner\r\npocketed it without a word, and did not search me. In after months,\r\nwhen I was nearly famished, my estimation of “Majah Tunnah” was hardly\r\nenhanced by the reflection that what would have purchased me many good\r\nmeals was probably lost by him in betting on a pair of queens, when his\r\nopponent held a “king full.”\r\n\r\nI ventured to step into the office to inquire after my comrades.\r\nOne of the whey-faced clerks said with the supercilious asperity\r\ncharacteristic of gnat-brained headquarters attaches:\r\n\r\n“Get out of here!” as if I had been a stray cur wandering in in search\r\nof a bone lunch.\r\n\r\nI wanted to feed the fellow to a pile-driver. The utmost I could hope\r\nfor in the way of revenge was that the delicate creature might some day\r\nmake a mistake in parting his hair, and catch his death of cold.\r\n\r\nThe guard conducted us across the street, and into the third story of\r\na building standing on the next corner below. Here I found about four\r\nhundred men, mostly belonging to the Army of the Potomac, who crowded\r\naround me with the usual questions to new prisoners: What was my\r\nRegiment, where and when captured, and:\r\n\r\nWhat were the prospects of exchange?\r\n\r\nIt makes me shudder now to recall how often, during the dreadful months\r\nthat followed, this momentous question was eagerly propounded to every\r\nnew comer: put with bated breath by men to whom exchange meant all that\r\nthey asked of this world, and possibly of the next; meant life, home,\r\nwife or sweet-heart, friends, restoration to manhood, and self-respect\r\n--everything, everything that makes existence in this world worth\r\nhaving.\r\n\r\nI answered as simply and discouragingly as did the tens of thousands\r\nthat came after me:\r\n\r\n“I did not hear anything about exchange.”\r\n\r\nA soldier in the field had many other things of more immediate interest\r\nto think about than the exchange of prisoners. The question only became\r\na living issue when he or some of his intimate friends fell into the\r\nenemy’s hands.\r\n\r\nThus began my first day in prison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION TO PRISON LIFE--THE PEMBERTON BUILDING AND ITS\r\nOCCUPANTS --NEAT SAILORS--ROLL CALL--RATIONS AND CLOTHING--CHIVALRIC\r\n“CONFISCATION.”\r\n\r\nI began acquainting myself with my new situation and surroundings. The\r\nbuilding into which I had been conducted was an old tobacco factory,\r\ncalled the “Pemberton building,” possibly from an owner of that name,\r\nand standing on the corner of what I was told were Fifteenth and Carey\r\nstreets. In front it was four stories high; behind but three, owing to\r\nthe rapid rise of the hill, against which it was built.\r\n\r\nIt fronted towards the James River and Kanawha Canal, and the James\r\nRiver--both lying side by side, and only one hundred yards distant,\r\nwith no intervening buildings. The front windows afforded a fine view.\r\nTo the right front was Libby, with its guards pacing around it on the\r\nsidewalk, watching the fifteen hundred officers confined within its\r\nwalls. At intervals during each day squads of fresh prisoners could\r\nbe seen entering its dark mouth, to be registered, and searched, and\r\nthen marched off to the prison assigned them. We could see up the James\r\nRiver for a mile or so, to where the long bridges crossing it bounded\r\nthe view. Directly in front, across the river, was a flat, sandy plain,\r\nsaid to be General Winfield Scott’s farm, and now used as a proving\r\nground for the guns cast at the Tredegar Iron Works.\r\n\r\nThe view down the river was very fine. It extended about twelve miles,\r\nto where a gap in the woods seemed to indicate a fort, which we\r\nimagined to be Fort Darling, at that time the principal fortification\r\ndefending the passage of the James.\r\n\r\nBetween that point and where we were lay the river, in a long, broad\r\nmirror-like expanse, like a pretty little inland lake. Occasionally\r\na busy little tug would bustle up or down, a gunboat move along with\r\nnoiseless dignity, suggestive of a reserved power, or a schooner\r\nbeat lazily from one side to the other. But these were so few as to\r\nmake even more pronounced the customary idleness that hung over the\r\nscene. The tug’s activity seemed spasmodic and forced--a sort of\r\nprotest against the gradually increasing lethargy that reigned upon\r\nthe bosom of the waters --the gunboat floated along as if performing\r\na perfunctory duty, and the schooners sailed about as if tired of\r\nremaining in one place. That little stretch of water was all that was\r\nleft for a cruising ground. Beyond Fort Darling the Union gunboats\r\nlay, and the only vessel that passed the barrier was the occasional\r\nflag-of-truce steamer.\r\n\r\nThe basement of the building was occupied as a store-house for the\r\ntaxes-in-kind which the Confederate Government collected. On the first\r\nfloor were about five hundred men. On the second floor--where I was\r\n--were about four hundred men. These were principally from the First\r\nDivision, First Corps distinguished by a round red patch on their\r\ncaps; First Division, Second Corps, marked by a red clover leaf; and\r\nthe First Division, Third Corps, who wore a red diamond. They were\r\nmainly captured at Gettysburg and Mine Run. Besides these there was\r\na considerable number from the Eighth Corps, captured at Winchester,\r\nand a large infusion of Cavalry-First, Second and Third West\r\nVirginia--taken in Averill’s desperate raid up the Virginia Valley,\r\nwith the Wytheville Salt Works as an objective.\r\n\r\nOn the third floor were about two hundred sailors and marines, taken\r\nin the gallant but luckless assault upon the ruins of Fort Sumter, in\r\nthe September previous. They retained the discipline of the ship in\r\ntheir quarters, kept themselves trim and clean, and their floor as\r\nwhite as a ship’s deck. They did not court the society of the “sojers”\r\nbelow, whose camp ideas of neatness differed from theirs. A few old\r\nbarnacle-backs always sat on guard around the head of the steps leading\r\nfrom the lower rooms. They chewed tobacco enormously, and kept their\r\nmouths filled with the extracted juice. Any luckless “sojer” who\r\nattempted to ascend the stairs usually returned in haste, to avoid the\r\ndeluge of the filthy liquid.\r\n\r\nFor convenience in issuing rations we were divided into messes of\r\ntwenty, each mess electing a Sergeant as its head, and each floor\r\nelecting a Sergeant-of-the-Floor, who drew rations and enforced what\r\nlittle discipline was observed.\r\n\r\nThough we were not so neat as the sailors above us, we tried to keep\r\nour quarters reasonably clean, and we washed the floor every morning;\r\ngetting down on our knees and rubbing it clean and dry with rags.\r\nEach mess detailed a man each day to wash up the part of the floor it\r\noccupied, and he had to do this properly or no ration would be given\r\nhim. While the washing up was going on each man stripped himself\r\nand made close examination of his garments for the body-lice, which\r\notherwise would have increased beyond control. Blankets were also\r\ncarefully hunted over for these “small deer.”\r\n\r\nAbout eight o’clock a spruce little lisping rebel named Ross would\r\nappear with a book, and a body-guard, consisting of a big Irishman,\r\nwho had the air of a Policeman, and carried a musket barrel made\r\ninto a cane. Behind him were two or three armed guards. The\r\nSergeant-of-the-Floor commanded:\r\n\r\n“Fall in in four ranks for roll-call.”\r\n\r\nWe formed along one side of the room; the guards halted at the head of\r\nthe stairs; Ross walked down in front and counted the files, closely\r\nfollowed by his Irish aid, with his gun-barrel cane raised ready for\r\nuse upon any one who should arouse his ruffianly ire. Breaking ranks\r\nwe returned to our places, and sat around in moody silence for three\r\nhours. We had eaten nothing since the previous noon. Rising hungry, our\r\nhunger seemed to increase in arithmetical ratio with every quarter of\r\nan hour.\r\n\r\nThese times afforded an illustration of the thorough subjection of\r\nman to the tyrant Stomach. A more irritable lot of individuals could\r\nscarcely be found outside of a menagerie than these men during the\r\nhours waiting for rations. “Crosser than, two sticks” utterly failed\r\nas a comparison. They were crosser than the lines of a check apron.\r\nMany could have given odds to the traditional bear with a sore head,\r\nand run out of the game fifty points ahead of him. It was astonishingly\r\neasy to get up a fight at these times. There was no need of going\r\na step out of the way to search for it, as one could have a full\r\nfledged article of overwhelming size on his hands at any instant, by\r\na trifling indiscretion of speech or manner. All the old irritating\r\nflings between the cavalry, the artillery and the infantry, the older\r\n“first-call” men, and the later or “Three-Hundred-Dollar-men,” as\r\nthey were derisively dubbed, between the different corps of the Army\r\nof the Potomac, between men of different States, and lastly between\r\nthe adherents and opponents of McClellan, came to the lips and were\r\nanswered by a blow with the fist, when a ring would be formed around\r\nthe combatants by a crowd, which would encourage them with yells to do\r\ntheir best. In a few minutes one of the parties to the fistic debate,\r\nwho found the point raised by him not well taken, would retire to the\r\nsink to wash the blood from his battered face, and the rest would\r\nresume their seats and glower at space until some fresh excitement\r\nroused them. For the last hour or so of these long waits hardly a word\r\nwould be spoken. We were too ill-natured to talk for amusement, and\r\nthere was nothing else to talk for.\r\n\r\nThis spell was broken about eleven o’clock by the appearance at the\r\nhead of the stairway of the Irishman with the gun-barrel cane, and his\r\nsinging out:\r\n\r\n“Sargint uv the flure: fourtane min and a bread-box!”\r\n\r\nInstantly every man sprang to his feet, and pressed forward to be one\r\nof the favored fourteen. One did not get any more gyrations or obtain\r\nthem any sooner by this, but it was a relief, and a change to walk the\r\nhalf square outside the prison to the cookhouse, and help carry the\r\nrations back.\r\n\r\nFor a little while after our arrival in Richmond, the rations were\r\ntolerably good. There had been so much said about the privations\r\nof the prisoners that our Government had, after much quibbling and\r\nnegotiation, succeeded in getting the privilege of sending food and\r\nclothing through the lines to us. Of course but a small part of that\r\nsent ever reached its destination. There were too many greedy Rebels\r\nalong its line of passage to let much of it be received by those for\r\nwhom it was intended. We could see from our windows Rebels strutting\r\nabout in overcoats, in which the box wrinkles were still plainly\r\nvisible, wearing new “U. S.” blankets as cloaks, and walking in\r\nGovernment shoes, worth fabulous prices in Confederate money.\r\n\r\nFortunately for our Government the rebels decided to out themselves off\r\nfrom this profitable source of supply. We read one day in the Richmond\r\npapers that “President Davis and his Cabinet had come to the conclusion\r\nthat it was incompatible with the dignity of a sovereign power to\r\npermit another power with which it was at war, to feed and clothe\r\nprisoners in its hands.”\r\n\r\nI will not stop to argue this point of honor, and show its absurdity by\r\npointing out that it is not an unusual practice with nations at war. It\r\nis a sufficient commentary upon this assumption of punctiliousness that\r\nthe paper went on to say that some five tons of clothing and fifteen\r\ntons of food, which had been sent under a flag of truce to City Point,\r\nwould neither be returned nor delivered to us, but “converted to the\r\nuse of the Confederate Government.”\r\n\r\n               “And surely they are all honorable men!”\r\n\r\nHeaven save the mark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nBRANS OR PEAS--INSUFFICIENCY OF DARKY TESTIMONY--A GUARD KILLS A\r\nPRISONER--PRISONERS TEAZE THE GUARDS--DESPERATE OUTBREAK.\r\n\r\nBut, to return to the rations--a topic which, with escape or exchange,\r\nwere to be the absorbing ones for us for the next fifteen months. There\r\nwas now issued to every two men a loaf of coarse bread--made of a\r\nmixture of flour and meal--and about the size and shape of an ordinary\r\nbrick. This half loaf was accompanied, while our Government was allowed\r\nto furnish rations, with a small piece of corned beef. Occasionally we\r\ngot a sweet potato, or a half-pint or such a matter of soup made from\r\na coarse, but nutritious, bean or pea, called variously “nigger-pea,”\r\n“stock-pea,” or “cow-pea.”\r\n\r\nThis, by the way, became a fruitful bone of contention during our stay\r\nin the South. One strong party among us maintained that it was a bean,\r\nbecause it was shaped like one, and brown, which they claimed no pea\r\never was. The other party held that it was a pea because its various\r\nnames all agreed in describing it as a pea, and because it was so full\r\nof bugs--none being entirely free from insects, and some having as many\r\nas twelve by actual count--within its shell. This, they declared, was a\r\ndistinctive characteristic of the pea family. The contention began with\r\nour first instalment of the leguminous ration, and was still raging\r\nbetween the survivors who passed into our lines in 1865. It waxed hot\r\noccasionally, and each side continually sought evidence to support\r\nits view of the case. Once an old darky, sent into the prison on some\r\nerrand, was summoned to decide a hot dispute that was raging in the\r\ncrowd to which I belonged. The champion of the pea side said, producing\r\none of the objects of dispute:\r\n\r\n“Now, boys, keep still, till I put the question fairly. Now, uncle,\r\nwhat do they call that there?”\r\n\r\nThe colored gentleman scrutinized the vegetable closely, and replied,\r\n\r\n“Well, dey mos’ generally calls ’em stock-peas, round hyar aways.”\r\n\r\n“There,” said the pea-champion triumphantly.\r\n\r\n“But,” broke in the leader of the bean party, “Uncle, don’t they also\r\ncall them beans?”\r\n\r\n“Well, yes, chile, I spec dat lots of ’em does.”\r\n\r\nAnd this was about the way the matter usually ended.\r\n\r\nI will not attempt to bias the reader’s judgment by saying which side I\r\nbelieved to be right. As the historic British showman said, in reply to\r\nthe question as to whether an animal in his collection was a rhinoceros\r\nor an elephant, “You pays your money and you takes your choice.”\r\n\r\nThe rations issued to us, as will be seen above, though they appear\r\nscanty, were still sufficient to support life and health, and months\r\nafterward, in Andersonville, we used to look back to them as sumptuous.\r\nWe usually had them divided and eaten by noon, and, with the gnawings\r\nof hunger appeased, we spent the afternoon and evening comfortably.\r\nWe told stories, paced up and down, the floor for exercise, played\r\ncards, sung, read what few books were available, stood at the windows\r\nand studied the landscape, and watched the Rebels trying their guns\r\nand shells, and so on as long as it was daylight. Occasionally it was\r\ndangerous to be about the windows. This depended wholly on the temper\r\nof the guards. One day a member of a Virginia regiment, on guard on\r\nthe pavement in front, deliberately left his beat, walked out into\r\nthe center of the street, aimed his gun at a member of the Ninth West\r\nVirginia, who was standing at a window near, and firing, shot him\r\nthrough the heart, the bullet passing through his body, and through the\r\nfloor above. The act was purely malicious, and was done, doubtless,\r\nin revenge for some injury which our men had done the assassin or his\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nWe were not altogether blameless, by any means. There were few\r\nopportunities to say bitterly offensive things to the guards, let pass\r\nunimproved.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners in the third floor of the Smith building, adjoining us,\r\nhad their own way of teasing them. Late at night, when everybody would\r\nbe lying down, and out of the way of shots, a window in the third story\r\nwould open, a broomstick, with a piece nailed across to represent arms,\r\nand clothed with a cap and blouse, would be protruded, and a voice\r\ncoming from a man carefully protected by the wall, would inquire:\r\n\r\n“S-a-y, g-uarr-d, what time is it?”\r\n\r\nIf the guard was of the long suffering kind he would answer:\r\n\r\n“Take yo’ head back in, up dah; you kno hits agin all odahs to do dat?”\r\n\r\nThen the voice would say, aggravatingly, “Oh, well, go to ---- you ----\r\nRebel ----, if you can’t answer a civil question.”\r\n\r\nBefore the speech was ended the guard’s rifle would be at his shoulder\r\nand he would fire. Back would come the blouse and hat in haste, only to\r\ngo out again the next instant, with a derisive laugh, and,\r\n\r\n“Thought you were going to hurt somebody, didn’t you, you ---- ----\r\n---- ---- ----. But, Lord, you can’t shoot for sour apples; if I\r\ncouldn’t shoot no better than you, Mr. Johnny Reb, I would ----”\r\n\r\nBy this time the guard, having his gun loaded again, would cut short\r\nthe remarks with another shot, which, followed up with similar remarks,\r\nwould provoke still another, when an alarm sounding, the guards at\r\nLibby and all the other buildings around us would turn out. An officer\r\nof the guard would go up with a squad into the third floor, only\r\nto find everybody up there snoring away as if they were the Seven\r\nSleepers. After relieving his mind of a quantity of vigorous profanity,\r\nand threats to “buck and gag” and cut off the rations of the whole\r\nroom, the officer would return to his quarters in the guard house, but\r\nbefore he was fairly ensconced there the cap and blouse would go out\r\nagain, and the maddened guard be regaled with a spirited and vividly\r\nprofane lecture on the depravity of Rebels in general, and his own\r\nunworthiness in particular.\r\n\r\nOne night in January things took a more serious turn. The boys on the\r\nlower floor of our building had long considered a plan of escape. There\r\nwere then about fifteen thousand prisoners in Richmond--ten thousand on\r\nBelle Isle and five thousand in the buildings. Of these one thousand\r\nfive hundred were officers in Libby. Besides there were the prisoners\r\nin Castles Thunder and Lightning. The essential features of the plan\r\nwere that at a preconcerted signal we at the second and third floors\r\nshould appear at the windows with bricks and irons from the tobacco\r\npresses, which a should shower down on the guards and drive them away,\r\nwhile the men of the first floor would pour out, chase the guards\r\ninto the board house in the basement, seize their arms, drive those\r\naway from around Libby and the other prisons, release the officers,\r\norganize into regiments and brigades, seize the armory, set fire to the\r\npublic buildings and retreat from the City, by the south side of the\r\nJames, where there was but a scanty force of Rebels, and more could be\r\nprevented from coming over by burning the bridges behind us.\r\n\r\nIt was a magnificent scheme, and might have been carried out, but there\r\nwas no one in the building who was generally believed to have the\r\nqualities of a leader.\r\n\r\nBut while it was being debated a few of the hot heads on the lower\r\nfloor undertook to precipitate the crisis. They seized what they\r\nthought was a favorable opportunity, overpowered the guard who stood at\r\nthe foot of the stairs, and poured into the street. The other guards\r\nfell back and opened fire on them; other troops hastened up, and soon\r\ndrove them back into the building, after killing ten or fifteen. We of\r\nthe second and third floors did not anticipate the break at that time,\r\nand were taken as much by surprise as were the Rebels. Nearly all were\r\nlying down and many were asleep. Some hastened to the windows, and\r\ndropped missiles out, but before any concerted action could be taken it\r\nwas seen that the case was hopeless, and we remained quiet.\r\n\r\nAmong those who led in the assault was a drummer-boy of some New York\r\nRegiment, a recklessly brave little rascal. He had somehow smuggled a\r\nsmall four-shooter in with him, and when they rushed out he fired it\r\noff at the guards.\r\n\r\nAfter the prisoners were driven back, the Rebel officers came in and\r\nvapored around considerably, but confined themselves to big words.\r\nThey were particularly anxious to find the revolver, and ordered a\r\ngeneral and rigorous search for it. The prisoners were all ranged on\r\none side of the room and carefully examined by one party, while another\r\nhunted through the blankets and bundles. It was all in vain; no pistol\r\ncould be found. The boy had a loaf of wheat bread, bought from a baker\r\nduring the day. It was a round loaf, set together in two pieces like\r\na biscuit. He pulled these apart, laid the fourshooter between them,\r\npressed the two halves together, and went on calmly nibbling away at\r\nthe loaf while the search was progressing.\r\n\r\nTwo gunboats were brought up the next morning, and anchored in the\r\ncanal near us, with their heavy guns trained upon the building. It was\r\nthought that this would intimidate as from a repetition of the attack,\r\nbut our sailors conceived that, as they laid against the shore next to\r\nus, they could be easily captured, and their artillery made to assist\r\nus. A scheme to accomplish this was being wrought out, when we received\r\nnotice to move, and it came to naught.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE EXCHANGE AND THE CAUSE OF ITS INTERRUPTION--BRIEF RESUME OF THE\r\nDIFFERENT CARTELS, AND THE DIFFICULTIES THAT LED TO THEIR SUSPENSION.\r\n\r\nFew questions intimately connected with the actual operations of\r\nthe Rebellion have been enveloped with such a mass of conflicting\r\nstatement as the responsibility for the interruption of the exchange.\r\nSouthern writers and politicians, naturally anxious to diminish as\r\nmuch as possible the great odium resting upon their section for the\r\ntreatment of prisoners of war during the last year and a half of the\r\nConfederacy’s existence, have vehemently charged that the Government of\r\nthe United States deliberately and pitilessly resigned to their fate\r\nsuch of its soldiers as fell into the hands of the enemy, and repelled\r\nall advances from the Rebel Government looking toward a resumption\r\nof exchange. It is alleged on our side, on the other hand, that our\r\nGovernment did all that was possible, consistent with National dignity\r\nand military prudence, to secure a release of its unfortunate men in\r\nthe power of the Rebels.\r\n\r\nOver this vexed question there has been waged an acrimonious\r\nwar of words, which has apparently led to no decision, nor any\r\nconvictions--the disputants, one and all, remaining on the sides of the\r\ncontroversy occupied by them when the debate began.\r\n\r\nI may not be in possession of all the facts bearing upon the case, and\r\nmay be warped in judgment by prejudices in favor of my own Government’s\r\nwisdom and humanity, but, however this may be, the following is my firm\r\nbelief as to the controlling facts in this lamentable affair:\r\n\r\n1. For some time after the beginning of hostilities our Government\r\nrefused to exchange prisoners with the Rebels, on the ground that this\r\nmight be held by the European powers who were seeking a pretext for\r\nacknowledging the Confederacy, to be admission by us that the war was\r\nno longer an insurrection but a revolution, which had resulted in the\r\n‘de facto’ establishment of a new nation. This difficulty was finally\r\ngotten over by recognizing the Rebels as belligerents, which, while it\r\nplaced them on a somewhat different plane from mere insurgents, did not\r\nelevate them to the position of soldiers of a foreign power.\r\n\r\n2. Then the following cartel was agreed upon by Generals Dig on our\r\nside and Hill on that of the Rebels:\r\n\r\nHAXALL’S LANDING, ON JAMES RIVER, July 22, 1882.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, having been commissioned by the authorities they\r\nrespectively represent to make arrangements for a general exchange of\r\nprisoners of war, have agreed to the following articles:\r\n\r\nARTICLE I.--It is hereby agreed and stipulated, that all prisoners\r\nof war, held by either party, including those taken on private armed\r\nvessels, known as privateers, shall be exchanged upon the conditions\r\nand terms following:\r\n\r\nPrisoners to be exchanged man for man and officer for officer.\r\nPrivateers to be placed upon the footing of officers and men of the\r\nnavy.\r\n\r\nMen and officers of lower grades may be exchanged for officers of\r\na higher grade, and men and officers of different services may be\r\nexchanged according to the following scale of equivalents:\r\n\r\nA General-commanding-in-chief, or an Admiral, shall be exchanged for\r\nofficers of equal rank, or for sixty privates or common seamen.\r\n\r\nA Commodore, carrying a broad pennant, or a Brigadier General, shall\r\nbe exchanged for officers of equal rank, or twenty privates or common\r\nseamen.\r\n\r\nA Captain in the Navy, or a Colonel, shall be exchanged for officers of\r\nequal rank, or for fifteen privates or common seamen.\r\n\r\nA Lieutenant Colonel, or Commander in the Navy, shall be exchanged for\r\nofficers of equal rank, or for ten privates or common seamen.\r\n\r\nA Lieutenant, or a Master in the Navy, or a Captain in the Army or\r\nmarines shall be exchanged for officers of equal rank, or six privates\r\nor common seamen.\r\n\r\nMaster’s-mates in the Navy, or Lieutenants or Ensigns in the Army,\r\nshall be exchanged for officers of equal rank, or four privates or\r\ncommon seamen. Midshipmen, warrant officers in the Navy, masters of\r\nmerchant vessels and commanders of privateers, shall be exchanged for\r\nofficers of equal rank, or three privates or common seamen; Second\r\nCaptains, Lieutenants or mates of merchant vessels or privateers, and\r\nall petty officers in the Navy, and all noncommissioned officers in\r\nthe Army or marines, shall be severally exchanged for persons of equal\r\nrank, or for two privates or common seamen; and private soldiers or\r\ncommon seamen shall be exchanged for each other man for man.\r\n\r\nARTICLE II.--Local, State, civil and militia rank held by persons\r\nnot in actual military service will not be recognized; the basis of\r\nexchange being the grade actually held in the naval and military\r\nservice of the respective parties.\r\n\r\nARTICLE III.--If citizens held by either party on charges of\r\ndisloyalty, or any alleged civil offense, are exchanged, it shall only\r\nbe for citizens. Captured sutlers, teamsters, and all civilians in the\r\nactual service of either party, to be exchanged for persons in similar\r\npositions.\r\n\r\nARTICLE IV.--All prisoners of war to be discharged on parole in ten\r\ndays after their capture; and the prisoners now held, and those\r\nhereafter taken, to be transported to the points mutually agreed\r\nupon, at the expense of the capturing party. The surplus prisoners\r\nnot exchanged shall not be permitted to take up arms again, nor to\r\nserve as military police or constabulary force in any fort, garrison\r\nor field-work, held by either of the respective parties, nor as guards\r\nof prisoners, deposits or stores, nor to discharge any duty usually\r\nperformed by soldiers, until exchanged under the provisions of this\r\ncartel. The exchange is not to be considered complete until the officer\r\nor soldier exchanged for has been actually restored to the lines to\r\nwhich he belongs.\r\n\r\nARTICLE V.--Each party upon the discharge of prisoners of the other\r\nparty is authorized to discharge an equal number of their own officers\r\nor men from parole, furnishing, at the same time, to the other party a\r\nlist of their prisoners discharged, and of their own officers and men\r\nrelieved from parole; thus enabling each party to relieve from parole\r\nsuch of their officers and men as the party may choose. The lists\r\nthus mutually furnished, will keep both parties advised of the true\r\ncondition of the exchange of prisoners.\r\n\r\nARTICLE VI.--The stipulations and provisions above mentioned to be of\r\nbinding obligation during the continuance of the war, it matters not\r\nwhich party may have the surplus of prisoners; the great principles\r\ninvolved being, First, An equitable exchange of prisoners, man for\r\nman, or officer for officer, or officers of higher grade exchanged\r\nfor officers of lower grade, or for privates, according to scale of\r\nequivalents. Second, That privates and officers and men of different\r\nservices may be exchanged according to the same scale of equivalents.\r\nThird, That all prisoners, of whatever arm of service, are to be\r\nexchanged or paroled in ten days from the time of their capture, if it\r\nbe practicable to transfer them to their own lines in that time; if\r\nnot, so soon thereafter as practicable. Fourth, That no officer, or\r\nsoldier, employed in the service of either party, is to be considered\r\nas exchanged and absolved from his parole until his equivalent has\r\nactually reached the lines of his friends. Fifth, That parole forbids\r\nthe performance of field, garrison, police, or guard or constabulary\r\nduty.\r\n\r\n                                   JOHN A. DIX, Major General.\r\n\r\n                                   D. H. HILL, Major General, C. S. A.\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTARY ARTICLES.\r\n\r\nARTICLE VII.--All prisoners of war now held on either side, and all\r\nprisoners hereafter taken, shall be sent with all reasonable dispatch\r\nto A. M. Aiken’s, below Dutch Gap, on the James River, in Virginia, or\r\nto Vicksburg, on the Mississippi River, in the State of Mississippi,\r\nand there exchanged of paroled until such exchange can be effected,\r\nnotice being previously given by each party of the number of prisoners\r\nit will send, and the time when they will be delivered at those points\r\nrespectively; and in case the vicissitudes of war shall change the\r\nmilitary relations of the places designated in this article to the\r\ncontending parties, so as to render the same inconvenient for the\r\ndelivery and exchange of prisoners, other places bearing as nearly as\r\nmay be the present local relations of said places to the lines of said\r\nparties, shall be, by mutual agreement, substituted. But nothing in\r\nthis article contained shall prevent the commanders of the two opposing\r\narmies from exchanging prisoners or releasing them on parole, at other\r\npoints mutually agreed on by said commanders.\r\n\r\nARTICLE VIII.--For the purpose of carrying into effect the foregoing\r\narticles of agreement, each party will appoint two agents for the\r\nexchange of prisoners of war, whose duty it shall be to communicate\r\nwith each other by correspondence and otherwise; to prepare the lists\r\nof prisoners; to attend to the delivery of the prisoners at the places\r\nagreed on, and to carry out promptly, effectually, and in good faith,\r\nall the details and provisions of the said articles of agreement.\r\n\r\nARTICLE IX.--And, in case any misunderstanding shall arise in regard\r\nto any clause or stipulation in the foregoing articles, it is mutually\r\nagreed that such misunderstanding shall not affect the release of\r\nprisoners on parole, as herein provided, but shall be made the subject\r\nof friendly explanation, in order that the object of this agreement may\r\nneither be defeated nor postponed.\r\n\r\n                              JOHN A. DIX, Major General.\r\n                              D. H. HILL, Major General. C. S. A.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis plan did not work well. Men on both sides, who wanted a little\r\nrest from soldiering, could obtain it by so straggling in the vicinity\r\nof the enemy. Their parole--following close upon their capture,\r\nfrequently upon the spot--allowed them to visit home, and sojourn\r\nawhile where were pleasanter pastures than at the front. Then the\r\nRebels grew into the habit of paroling everybody that they could\r\nconstrain into being a prisoner of war. Peaceable, unwarlike and\r\ndecrepit citizens of Kentucky, East Tennessee, West Virginia, Missouri\r\nand Maryland were “captured” and paroled, and setoff against regular\r\nRebel soldiers taken by us.\r\n\r\n3. After some months of trial of this scheme, a modification of\r\nthe cartel was agreed upon, the main feature of which was that all\r\nprisoners must be reduced to possession, and delivered to the exchange\r\nofficers either at City Point, Va., or Vicksburg, Miss. This worked\r\nvery well for some months, until our Government began organizing negro\r\ntroops. The Rebels then issued an order that neither these troops nor\r\ntheir officers should be held as amenable to the laws of war, but that,\r\nwhen captured, the men should be returned to slavery, and the officers\r\nturned over to the Governors of the States in which they were taken, to\r\nbe dealt with according to the stringent law punishing the incitement\r\nof servile insurrection. Our Government could not permit this for a\r\nday. It was bound by every consideration of National honor to protect\r\nthose who wore its uniform and bore its flag. The Rebel Government was\r\npromptly informed that rebel officers and men would be held as hostages\r\nfor the proper treatment of such members of colored regiments as might\r\nbe taken.\r\n\r\n4. This discussion did not put a stop to the exchange, but while it\r\nwas going on Vicksburg was captured, and the battle of Gettysburg was\r\nfought. The first placed one of the exchange points in our hands. At\r\nthe opening of the fight at Gettysburg Lee captured some six thousand\r\nPennsylvania militia. He sent to Meade to have these exchanged on\r\nthe field of battle. Meade declined to do so for two reasons: first,\r\nbecause it was against the cartel, which prescribed that prisoners must\r\nbe reduced to possession; and second, because he was anxious to have\r\nLee hampered with such a body of prisoners, since it was very doubtful\r\nif he could get his beaten army back across the Potomac, let alone his\r\nprisoners. Lee then sent a communication to General Couch, commanding\r\nthe Pennsylvania militia, asking him to receive prisoners on parole,\r\nand Couch, not knowing what Meade had done, acceded to the request.\r\nOur Government disavowed Couch’s action instantly, and ordered the\r\nparoles to be treated as of no force, whereupon the Rebel Government\r\nordered back into the field twelve thousand of the prisoners captured\r\nby Grant’s army at Vicksburg.\r\n\r\n5. The paroling now stopped abruptly, leaving in the hands of both\r\nsides the prisoners captured at Gettysburg, except the militia above\r\nmentioned. The Rebels added considerably to those in their hands by\r\ntheir captures at Chickamauga, while we gained a great many at Mission\r\nRidge, Cumberland Gap and elsewhere, so that at the time we arrived in\r\nRichmond the Rebels had about fifteen thousand prisoners in their hands\r\nand our Government had about twenty-five thousand.\r\n\r\n6. The rebels now began demanding that the prisoners on both sides be\r\nexchanged--man for man--as far as they went, and the remainder paroled.\r\nOur Government offered to exchange man for man, but declined--on\r\naccount of the previous bad faith of the Rebels--to release the balance\r\non parole. The Rebels also refused to make any concessions in regard to\r\nthe treatment of officers and men of colored regiments.\r\n\r\n7. At this juncture General B. F. Butler was appointed to the command\r\nof the Department of the Blackwater, which made him an ex-officio\r\nCommissioner of Exchange. The Rebels instantly refused to treat\r\nwith him, on the ground that he was outlawed by the proclamation of\r\nJefferson Davis. General Butler very pertinently replied that this only\r\nplaced him nearer their level, as Jefferson Davis and all associated\r\nwith him in the Rebel Government had been outlawed by the proclamation\r\nof President Lincoln. The Rebels scorned to notice this home thrust by\r\nthe Union General.\r\n\r\n8. On February 12, 1864, General Butler addressed a letter to the Rebel\r\nCommissioner Ould, in which be asked, for the sake of humanity, that\r\nthe questions interrupting the exchange be left temporarily in abeyance\r\nwhile an informal exchange was put in operation. He would send five\r\nhundred prisoners to City Point; let them be met by a similar number\r\nof Union prisoners. This could go on from day to day until all in each\r\nother’s hands should be transferred to their respective flags.\r\n\r\nThe five hundred sent with the General’s letter were received, and\r\nfive hundred Union prisoners returned for them. Another five hundred,\r\nsent the next day, were refused, and so this reasonable and humane\r\nproposition ended in nothing.\r\n\r\nThis was the condition of affairs in February, 1864, when the Rebel\r\nauthorities concluded to send us to Andersonville. If the reader will\r\nfix these facts in his minds I will explain other phases as they\r\ndevelop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nPUTTING IN THE TIME--RATIONS--COOKING UTENSILS--“FIAT” SOUP--“SPOONING”\r\n--AFRICAN NEWSPAPER VENDERS--TRADING GREENBACKS FOR CONFEDERATE MONEY\r\n--VISIT FROM JOHN MORGAN.\r\n\r\nThe Winter days passed on, one by one, after the manner described in\r\na former chapter,--the mornings in ill-nature hunger; the afternoons\r\nand evenings in tolerable comfort. The rations kept growing lighter\r\nand lighter; the quantity of bread remained the same, but the meat\r\ndiminished, and occasional days would pass without any being issued.\r\nThen we receive a pint or less of soup made from the beans or peas\r\nbefore mentioned, but this, too, suffered continued change, in the\r\ngradually increasing proportion of James River water, and decreasing of\r\nthat of the beans.\r\n\r\nThe water of the James River is doubtless excellent: it looks well--at\r\na distance--and is said to serve the purposes of ablution and\r\nnavigation admirably. There seems to be a limit however, to the extent\r\nof its advantageous combination with the bean (or pea) for nutritive\r\npurposes. This, though, was or view of the case, merely, and not\r\nshared in to any appreciably extent by the gentlemen who were managing\r\nour boarding house. We seemed to view the matter through allopathic\r\nspectacles, they through homoeopathic lenses. We thought that the\r\natomic weight of peas (or beans) and the James River fluid were about\r\nequal, which would indicate that the proper combining proportions would\r\nbe, say a bucket of beans (or peas) to a bucket of water. They held\r\nthat the nutritive potency was increased by the dilution, and the best\r\nresults were obtainable when the symptoms of hunger were combated by\r\nthe trituration of a bucketful of the peas-beans with a barrel of ‘aqua\r\njamesiana.’\r\n\r\nMy first experience with this “flat” soup was very instructive, if\r\nnot agreeable. I had come into prison, as did most other prisoners,\r\nabsolutely destitute of dishes, or cooking utensils. The well-used,\r\nhalf-canteen frying-pan, the blackened quart cup, and the spoon, which\r\nformed the usual kitchen outfit of the cavalryman in the field, were\r\nin the haversack on my saddle, and were lost to me when I separated\r\nfrom my horse. Now, when we were told that we were to draw soup, I was\r\nin great danger of losing my ration from having no vessel in which to\r\nreceive it. There were but few tin cups in the prison, and these were,\r\nof course, wanted by their owners. By great good fortune I found an\r\nempty fruit can, holding about a quart. I was also lucky enough to find\r\na piece from which to make a bail. I next manufactured a spoon and\r\nknife combined from a bit of hoop-iron.\r\n\r\nThese two humble utensils at once placed myself and my immediate\r\nchums on another plane, as far as worldly goods were concerned. We\r\nwere better off than the mass, and as well off as the most fortunate.\r\nIt was a curious illustration of that law of political economy which\r\nteaches that so-called intrinsic value is largely adventitious. Their\r\npossession gave us infinitely more consideration among our fellows than\r\nwould the possession of a brown-stone front in an eligible location,\r\nfurnished with hot and cold water throughout, and all the modern\r\nimprovements. It was a place where cooking utensils were in demand,\r\nand title-deeds to brown-stone fronts were not. We were in possession\r\nof something which every one needed every day, and, therefore, were\r\npersons of consequence and consideration to those around us who were\r\npresent or prospective borrowers.\r\n\r\nOn our side we obeyed another law of political economy: We clung to\r\nour property with unrelaxing tenacity, made the best use of it in our\r\nintercourse with our fellows, and only gave it up after our release and\r\nentry into a land where the plenitude of cooking utensils of superior\r\nconstruction made ours valueless. Then we flung them into the sea, with\r\nlittle gratitude for the great benefit they had been to us. We were\r\nmore anxious to get rid of the many hateful recollections clustering\r\naround them.\r\n\r\nBut, to return to the alleged soup: As I started to drink my first\r\nration it seemed to me that there was a superfluity of bugs upon its\r\nsurface. Much as I wanted animal food, I did not care for fresh meat\r\nin that form. I skimmed them off carefully, so as to lose as little\r\nsoup as possible. But the top layer seemed to be underlaid with another\r\nequally dense. This was also skimmed off as deftly as possible. But\r\nbeneath this appeared another layer, which, when removed, showed still\r\nanother; and so on, until I had scraped to the bottom of the can, and\r\nthe last of the bugs went with the last of my soup. I have before\r\nspoken of the remarkable bug fecundity of the beans (or peas). This was\r\na demonstration of it. Every scouped out pea (or bean) which found its\r\nway into the soup bore inside of its shell from ten to twenty of these\r\nhard-crusted little weevil. Afterward I drank my soup without skimming.\r\nIt was not that I hated the weevil less, but that I loved the soup\r\nmore. It was only another step toward a closer conformity to that grand\r\nrule which I have made the guiding maxim of my life:\r\n\r\n‘When I must, I had better.’\r\n\r\nI recommend this to other young men starting on their career.\r\n\r\nThe room in which we were was barely large enough for all of us to lie\r\ndown at once. Even then it required pretty close “spooning” together\r\n--so close in fact that all sleeping along one side would have to turn\r\nat once. It was funny to watch this operation. All, for instance, would\r\nbe lying on their right sides. They would begin to get tired, and one\r\nof the wearied ones would sing out to the Sergeant who was in command\r\nof the row--\r\n\r\n“Sergeant: let’s spoon the other way.”\r\n\r\nThat individual would reply:\r\n\r\n“All right. Attention! LEFT SPOON!!” and the whole line would at once\r\nflop over on their left sides.\r\n\r\nThe feet of the row that slept along the east wall on the floor below\r\nus were in a line with the edge of the outer door, and a chalk line\r\ndrawn from the crack between the door and the frame to the opposite\r\nwall would touch, say 150 pairs of feet. They were a noisy crowd down\r\nthere, and one night their noise so provoked the guard in front of the\r\ndoor that he called out to them to keep quiet or he would fire in upon\r\nthem. They greeted this threat with a chorus profanely uncomplimentary\r\nto the purity of the guard’s ancestry; they did not imply his descent\r\na la Darwin, from the remote monkey, but more immediate generation\r\nby a common domestic animal. The incensed Rebel opened the door wide\r\nenough to thrust his gun in, and he fired directly down the line of\r\ntoes. His piece was apparently loaded with buckshot, and the little\r\nballs must have struck the legs, nipped off the toes, pierced the feet,\r\nand otherwise slightly wounded the lower extremities of fifty men. The\r\nsimultaneous shriek that went up was deafening. It was soon found out\r\nthat nobody had been hurt seriously, and there was not a little fun\r\nover the occurrence.\r\n\r\nOne of the prisoners in Libby was Brigadier General Neal Dow, of Maine,\r\nwho had then a National reputation as a Temperance advocate, and the\r\nauthor of the famous Maine Liquor Law. We, whose places were near the\r\nfront window, used to see him frequently on the street, accompanied\r\nby a guard. He was allowed, we understood, to visit our sick in the\r\nhospital. His long, snowy beard and hair gave him a venerable and\r\ncommanding appearance.\r\n\r\nNewsboys seemed to be a thing unknown in Richmond. The papers were\r\nsold on the streets by negro men. The one who frequented our section\r\nwith the morning journals had a mellow; rich baritone for which we\r\nwould be glad to exchange the shrill cries of our street Arabs. We long\r\nremembered him as one of the peculiar features of Richmond. He had one\r\nunvarying formula for proclaiming his wares. It ran in this wise:\r\n\r\n“Great Nooze in de papahs!\r\n\r\n“Great Nooze from Orange Coaht House, Virginny!\r\n\r\n“Great Nooze from Alexandry, Virginny!\r\n\r\n“Great Nooze from Washington City!\r\n\r\n“Great Nooze from Chattanoogy, Tennessee!\r\n\r\n“Great Nooze from Chahlston, Sou’ Cahlina!\r\n\r\n“Great Nooze in depapahs!”\r\n\r\nIt did not matter to him that the Rebels had not been at some of these\r\nplaces for months. He would not change for such mere trifles as the\r\nentire evaporation of all possible interest connected with Chattanooga\r\nand Alexandria. He was a true Bourbon Southerner--he learned nothing\r\nand forgot nothing.\r\n\r\nThere was a considerable trade driven between the prisoners and the\r\nguard at the door. This was a very lucrative position for the latter,\r\nand men of a commercial turn of mind generally managed to get stationed\r\nthere. The blockade had cut off the Confederacy’s supplies from the\r\nouter world, and the many trinkets about a man’s person were in good\r\ndemand at high prices. The men of the Army of the Potomac, who were\r\npaid regularly, and were always near their supplies, had their pockets\r\nfilled with combs, silk handkerchiefs, knives, neckties, gold pens,\r\npencils, silver watches, playing cards, dice, etc. Such of these as\r\nescaped appropriation by their captors and Dick Turner, were eagerly\r\nbought by the guards, who paid fair prices in Confederate money, or\r\ntraded wheat bread, tobacco, daily papers, etc., for them.\r\n\r\nThere was also considerable brokerage in money, and the manner of doing\r\nthis was an admirable exemplification of the folly of the “fiat” money\r\nidea. The Rebels exhausted their ingenuity in framing laws to sustain\r\nthe purchasing power of their paper money. It was made legal tender for\r\nall debts public and private; it was decreed that the man who refused\r\nto take it was a public enemy; all the considerations of patriotism\r\nwere rallied to its support, and the law provided that any citizens\r\nfound trafficking in the money of the enemy--i.e., greenbacks, should\r\nsuffer imprisonment in the Penitentiary, and any soldier so offending\r\nshould suffer death.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this, in Richmond, the head and heart of the\r\nConfederacy, in January, 1864--long before the Rebel cause began to\r\nlook at all desperate--it took a dollar to buy such a loaf of bread as\r\nnow sells for ten cents; a newspaper was a half dollar, and everything\r\nelse in proportion. And still worse: There was not a day during our\r\nstay in Richmond but what one could go to the hole in the door before\r\nwhich the guard was pacing and call out in a loud whisper:\r\n\r\n“Say, Guard: do you want to buy some greenbacks?”\r\n\r\nAnd be sure that the reply would be, after a furtive glance around to\r\nsee that no officer was watching:\r\n\r\n“Yes; how much do you want for them?”\r\n\r\nThe reply was then: “Ten for one.”\r\n\r\n“All right; how much have you got?”\r\n\r\nThe Yankee would reply; the Rebel would walk to the farther end of his\r\nbeat, count out the necessary amount, and, returning, put up one hand\r\nwith it, while with the other he caught hold of one end of the Yankee’s\r\ngreenback. At the word, both would release their holds simultaneously,\r\nthe exchange was complete, and the Rebel would pace industriously\r\nup and down his beat with the air of the school boy who “ain’t been\r\na-doin’ nothing.”\r\n\r\nThere was never any risk in approaching any guard with a proposition of\r\nthis kind. I never heard of one refusing to trade for greenbacks, and\r\nif the men on guard could not be restrained by these stringent laws,\r\nwhat hope could there be of restraining anybody else?\r\n\r\nOne day we were favored with a visit from the redoubtable General\r\nJohn H. Morgan, next to J. E. B. Stuart the greatest of Rebel cavalry\r\nleaders. He had lately escaped from the Ohio Penitentiary. He was\r\ninvited to Richmond to be made a Major General, and was given a grand\r\novation by the citizens and civic Government. He came into our building\r\nto visit a number of the First Kentucky Cavalry (loyal)--captured at\r\nNew Philadelphia, East Tennessee--whom he was anxious to have exchanged\r\nfor men of his own regiment--the First Kentucky Cavalry (Rebel)--who\r\nwere captured at the same time he was. I happened to get very close to\r\nhim while he was standing there talking to his old acquaintances, and I\r\nmade a mental photograph of him, which still retains all its original\r\ndistinctness. He was a tall, heavy man, with a full, coarse, and\r\nsomewhat dull face, and lazy, sluggish gray eyes. His long black hair\r\nwas carefully oiled, and turned under at the ends, as was the custom\r\nwith the rural beaux some years ago. His face was clean shaved, except\r\na large, sandy goatee. He wore a high silk hat, a black broadcloth\r\ncoat, Kentucky jeans pantaloons, neatly fitting boots, and no vest.\r\nThere was nothing remotely suggestive of unusual ability or force of\r\ncharacter, and I thought as I studied him that the sting of George D.\r\nPrentice’s bon mot about him was in its acrid truth. Said Mr. Prentice:\r\n\r\n“Why don’t somebody put a pistol to Basil Duke’s head, and blow John\r\nMorgan’s brains out!” [Basil Duke was John Morgan’s right hand man.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nREMARKS AS TO NOMENCLATURE--VACCINATION AND ITS EFFECTS--“N’YAARKER’S”\r\n--THEIR CHARACTERISTICS AND THEIR METHODS OF OPERATING.\r\n\r\nBefore going any further in this narrative it may be well to state that\r\nthe nomenclature employed is not used in any odious or disparaging\r\nsense. It is simply the adoption of the usual terms employed by the\r\nsoldiers of both sides in speaking to or of each other. We habitually\r\nspoke of them and to them, as “Rebels,” and “Johnnies;” they of\r\nand to us, as “Yanks,” and “Yankees.” To have said “Confederates,”\r\n“Southerners,” “Secessionists,” or “Federalists,” “Unionists,”\r\n“Northerners” or “Nationalists,” would have seemed useless euphemism.\r\nThe plainer terms suited better, and it was a day when things were more\r\nimportant than names.\r\n\r\nFor some inscrutable reason the Rebels decided to vaccinate us all.\r\nWhy they did this has been one of the unsolved problems of my life. It\r\nis true that there was small pox in the City, and among the prisoners\r\nat Danville; but that any consideration for our safety should have\r\nled them to order general inoculation is not among the reasonable\r\ninferences. But, be that as it may, vaccination was ordered, and\r\nperformed. By great good luck I was absent from the building with the\r\nsquad drawing rations, when our room was inoculated, so I escaped what\r\nwas an infliction to all, and fatal to many. The direst consequences\r\nfollowed the operation. Foul ulcers appeared on various parts of the\r\nbodies of the vaccinated. In many instances the arms literally rotted\r\noff; and death followed from a corruption of the blood. Frequently the\r\nfaces, and other parts of those who recovered, were disfigured by the\r\nghastly cicatrices of healed ulcers. A special friend of mine, Sergeant\r\nFrank Beverstock--then a member of the Third Virginia Cavalry, (loyal),\r\nand after the war a banker in Bowling Green, O.,--bore upon his temple\r\nto his dying day, (which occurred a year ago), a fearful scar, where\r\nthe flesh had sloughed off from the effects of the virus that had\r\ntainted his blood.\r\n\r\nThis I do not pretend to account for. We thought at the time that the\r\nRebels had deliberately poisoned the vaccine matter with syphilitic\r\nvirus, and it was so charged upon them. I do not now believe that this\r\nwas so; I can hardly think that members of the humane profession of\r\nmedicine would be guilty of such subtle diabolism--worse even than\r\npoisoning the wells from which an enemy must drink. The explanation\r\nwith which I have satisfied myself is that some careless or stupid\r\npractitioner took the vaccinating lymph from diseased human bodies, and\r\nthus infected all with the blood venom, without any conception of what\r\nhe was doing. The low standard of medical education in the South makes\r\nthis theory quite plausible.\r\n\r\nWe now formed the acquaintance of a species of human vermin that united\r\nwith the Rebels, cold, hunger, lice and the oppression of distraint, to\r\nleave nothing undone that could add to the miseries of our prison life.\r\n\r\nThese were the fledglings of the slums and dives of New York--graduates\r\nof that metropolitan sink of iniquity where the rogues and criminals of\r\nthe whole world meet for mutual instruction in vice.\r\n\r\nThey were men who, as a rule, had never known, a day of honesty and\r\ncleanliness in their misspent lives; whose fathers, brothers and\r\nconstant companions were roughs, malefactors and, felons; whose\r\nmothers, wives and sisters were prostitutes, procuresses and thieves;\r\nmen who had from infancy lived in an atmosphere of sin, until it\r\nsaturated every fiber of their being as a dweller in a jungle imbibes\r\nmalaria by every one of his, millions of pores, until his very marrow\r\nis surcharged with it.\r\n\r\nThey included representatives from all nationalities, and their\r\ndescendants, but the English and Irish elements predominated. They\r\nhad an argot peculiar to themselves. It was partly made up of the\r\n“flash” language of the London thieves, amplified and enriched by the\r\ncant vocabulary and the jargon of crime of every European tongue.\r\nThey spoke it with a peculiar accent and intonation that made them\r\ninstantly recognizable from the roughs of all other Cities. They called\r\nthemselves “N’Yaarkers;” we came to know them as “Raiders.”\r\n\r\nIf everything in the animal world has its counterpart among men, then\r\nthese were the wolves, jackals and hyenas of the race at once cowardly\r\nand fierce--audaciously bold when the power of numbers was on their\r\nside, and cowardly when confronted with resolution by anything like an\r\nequality of strength.\r\n\r\nLike all other roughs and rascals of whatever degree, they were utterly\r\nworthless as soldiers. There may have been in the Army some habitual\r\ncorner loafer, some fistic champion of the bar-room and brothel, some\r\nTerror of Plug Uglyville, who was worth the salt in the hard tack he\r\nconsumed, but if there were, I did not form his acquaintance, and I\r\nnever heard of any one else who did. It was the rule that the man who\r\nwas the readiest in the use of fist and slungshot at home had the\r\ngreatest diffidence about forming a close acquaintance with cold lead\r\nin the neighborhood of the front. Thousands of the so-called “dangerous\r\nclasses” were recruited, from whom the Government did not receive so\r\nmuch service as would pay for the buttons on their uniforms. People\r\nexpected that they would make themselves as troublesome to the Rebels\r\nas they were to good citizens and the Police, but they were only\r\npugnacious to the provost guard, and terrible to the people in the rear\r\nof the Army who had anything that could be stolen.\r\n\r\nThe highest type of soldier which the world has yet produced is the\r\nintelligent, self-respecting American boy, with home, and father and\r\nmother and friends behind him, and duty in front beckoning him on. In\r\nthe sixty centuries that war has been a profession no man has entered\r\nits ranks so calmly resolute in confronting danger, so shrewd and\r\nenergetic in his aggressiveness, so tenacious of the defense and the\r\nassault, so certain to rise swiftly to the level of every emergency,\r\nas the boy who, in the good old phrase, had been “well-raised” in a\r\nGodfearing home, and went to the field in obedience to a conviction\r\nof duty. His unfailing courage and good sense won fights that the\r\nincompetency or cankering jealousy of commanders had lost. High\r\nofficers were occasionally disloyal, or willing to sacrifice their\r\ncountry to personal pique; still more frequently they were ignorant\r\nand inefficient; but the enlisted man had more than enough innate\r\nsoldiership to make amends for these deficiencies, and his superb\r\nconduct often brought honors and promotions to those only who deserved\r\nshame and disaster.\r\n\r\nOur “N’Yaarkers,” swift to see any opportunity for dishonest gain, had\r\ntaken to bounty-jumping, or, as they termed it, “leppin’ the bounty,”\r\nfor a livelihood. Those who were thrust in upon us had followed this\r\nuntil it had become dangerous, and then deserted to the Rebels. The\r\nlatter kept them at Castle Lightning for awhile, and then, rightly\r\nestimating their character, and considering that it was best to trade\r\nthem off for a genuine Rebel soldier, sent them in among us, to be\r\nexchanged regularly with us. There was not so much good faith as good\r\npolicy shown by this. It was a matter of indifference to the Rebels\r\nhow soon our Government shot these deserters after getting them in its\r\nhands again. They were only anxious to use them to get their own men\r\nback.\r\n\r\nThe moment they came into contact with us our troubles began. They\r\nstole whenever opportunities offered, and they were indefatigable in\r\nmaking these offer; they robbed by actual force, whenever force would\r\navail; and more obsequious lick-spittles to power never existed--they\r\nwere perpetually on the look-out for a chance to curry favor by\r\nbetraying some plan or scheme to those who guarded us.\r\n\r\nI saw one day a queer illustration of the audacious side of these\r\nfellows’ characters, and it shows at the same time how brazen\r\neffrontery will sometimes get the better of courage. In a room in an\r\nadjacent building were a number of these fellows, and a still greater\r\nnumber of East Tennesseeans. These latter were simple, ignorant\r\nfolks, but reasonably courageous. About fifty of them were sitting in\r\na group in one corner of the room, and near them a couple or three\r\n“N’Yaarkers.” Suddenly one of the latter said with an oath:\r\n\r\n“I was robbed last night; I lost two silver watches, a couple of rings,\r\nand about fifty dollars in greenbacks. I believe some of you fellers\r\nwent through me.”\r\n\r\nThis was all pure invention; he no more had the things mentioned than\r\nhe had purity of heart and a Christian spirit, but the unsophisticated\r\nTennesseeans did not dream of disputing his statement, and answered in\r\nchorus:\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, mister; we didn’t take your things; we ain’t that kind.”\r\n\r\nThis was like the reply of the lamb to the wolf, in the fable, and the\r\nN’Yaarker retorted with a simulated storm of passion, and a torrent of\r\noaths:\r\n\r\n“---- ---- I know ye did; I know some uv yez has got them; stand up\r\nagin the wall there till I search yez!”\r\n\r\nAnd that whole fifty men, any one of whom was physically equal to the\r\nN’Yaarker, and his superior in point of real courage, actually stood\r\nagainst the wall, and submitted to being searched and having taken\r\nfrom them the few Confederate bills they had, and such trinkets as the\r\nsearcher took a fancy to.\r\n\r\nI was thoroughly disgusted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nBELLE ISLE--TERRIBLE SUFFERING FROM COLD AND HUNGER--FATE OF LIEUTENANT\r\nBOISSEUX’S DOG--OUR COMPANY MYSTERY--TERMINATION OF ALL HOPES OF ITS\r\nSOLUTION.\r\n\r\nIn February my chum--B. B. Andrews, now a physician in Astoria,\r\nIllinois --was brought into our building, greatly to my delight and\r\nastonishment, and from him I obtained the much desired news as to the\r\nfate of my comrades. He told me they had been sent to Belle Isle,\r\nwhither he had gone, but succumbing to the rigors of that dreadful\r\nplace, he had been taken to the hospital, and, upon his convalesence,\r\nplaced in our prison.\r\n\r\nOur men were suffering terribly on the island. It was low, damp, and\r\nswept by the bleak, piercing winds that howled up and down the surface\r\nof the James. The first prisoners placed on the island had been given\r\ntents that afforded them some shelter, but these were all occupied when\r\nour battalion came in, so that they were compelled to lie on the snow\r\nand frozen ground, without shelter, covering of any kind, or fire.\r\nDuring this time the cold had been so intense that the James had frozen\r\nover three times.\r\n\r\nThe rations had been much worse than ours. The so-called soup had been\r\ndiluted to a ridiculous thinness, and meat had wholly disappeared.\r\nSo intense became the craving for animal food, that one day when\r\nLieutenant Boisseux--the Commandant--strolled into the camp with his\r\nbeloved white bull-terrier, which was as fat as a Cheshire pig, the\r\nlatter was decoyed into a tent, a blanket thrown over him, his throat\r\ncut within a rod of where his master was standing, and he was then\r\nskinned, cut up, cooked, and furnished a savory meal to many hungry men.\r\n\r\nWhen Boisseux learned of the fate of his four-footed friend he was, of\r\ncourse, intensely enraged, but that was all the good it did him. The\r\nonly revenge possible was to sentence more prisoners to ride the cruel\r\nwooden horse which he used as a means of punishment.\r\n\r\nFour of our company were already dead. Jacob Lowry and John Beach were\r\nstanding near the gate one day when some one snatched the guard’s\r\nblanket from the post where he had hung it, and ran. The enraged\r\nsentry leveled his gun and fired into the crowd. The balls passed\r\nthrough Lowry’s and Beach’s breasts. Then Charley Osgood, son of our\r\nLieutenant, a quiet, fair-haired, pleasant-spoken boy, but as brave and\r\nearnest as his gallant father, sank under the combination of hunger and\r\ncold. One stinging morning he was found stiff and stark, on the hard\r\nground, his bright, frank blue eyes glazed over in death.\r\n\r\nOne of the mysteries of our company was a tall, slender, elderly\r\nScotchman, who appeared on the rolls as William Bradford. What his\r\npast life had been, where he had lived, what his profession, whether\r\nmarried or single, no one ever knew. He came to us while in Camp of\r\nInstruction near Springfield, Illinois, and seemed to have left all his\r\npast behind him as he crossed the line of sentries around the camp.\r\nHe never received any letters, and never wrote any; never asked for a\r\nfurlough or pass, and never expressed a wish to be elsewhere than in\r\ncamp. He was courteous and pleasant, but very reserved. He interfered\r\nwith no one, obeyed orders promptly and without remark, and was always\r\npresent for duty. Scrupulously neat in dress, always as clean-shaved as\r\nan old-fashioned gentleman of the world, with manners and conversation\r\nthat showed him to have belonged to a refined and polished circle,\r\nhe was evidently out of place as a private soldier in a company of\r\nreckless and none-too-refined young Illinois troopers, but he never\r\navailed himself of any of the numerous opportunities offered to change\r\nhis associations. His elegant penmanship would have secured him an easy\r\nberth and better society at headquarters, but he declined to accept a\r\ndetail. He became an exciting mystery to a knot of us imaginative young\r\ncubs, who sorted up out of the reminiscential rag-bag of high colors\r\nand strong contrasts with which the sensational literature that we\r\nmost affected had plentifully stored our minds, a half-dozen intensely\r\nemotional careers for him. We spent much time in mentally trying these\r\non, and discussing which fitted him best. We were always expecting\r\na denouement that would come like a lightning flash and reveal his\r\nwhole mysterious past, showing him to have been the disinherited scion\r\nof some noble house, a man of high station, who was expiating some\r\nfearful crime; an accomplished villain eluding his pursuers--in short,\r\na Somebody who would be a fitting hero for Miss Braddon’s or Wilkie\r\nCollins’s literary purposes. We never got but two clues of his past,\r\nand they were faint ones. One day, he left lying near me a small copy\r\nof “Paradise Lost,” that he always carried with him. Turning over its\r\nleaves I found all of Milton’s bitter invectives against women heavily\r\nunderscored. Another time, while on guard with him, he spent much of\r\nhis time in writing some Latin verses in very elegant chirography\r\nupon the white painted boards of a fence along which his beat ran. We\r\npressed in all the available knowledge of Latin about camp, and found\r\nthat the tenor of the verses was very uncomplimentary to that charming\r\nsex which does us the honor of being our mothers and sweethearts.\r\nThese evidences we accepted as sufficient demonstration that there was\r\na woman at the bottom of the mystery, and made us more impatient for\r\nfurther developments. These were never to come. Bradford pined away an\r\nBelle Isle, and grew weaker, but no less reserved, each day. At length,\r\none bitter cold night ended it all. He was found in the morning stone\r\ndead, with his iron-gray hair frozen fast to the ground, upon which he\r\nlay. Our mystery had to remain unsolved. There was nothing about his\r\nperson to give any hint as to his past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nHOPING FOR EXCHANGE--AN EXPOSITION OF THE DOCTRINE OF CHANCES --OFF\r\nFOR ANDERSONVILLE--UNCERTAINTY AS TO OUR DESTINATION--ARRIVAL AT\r\nANDERSONVILLE.\r\n\r\nAs each lagging day closed, we confidently expected that the next would\r\nbring some news of the eagerly-desired exchange. We hopefully assured\r\neach other that the thing could not be delayed much longer; that the\r\nSpring was near, the campaign would soon open, and each government\r\nwould make an effort to get all its men into the field, and this would\r\nbring about a transfer of prisoners. A Sergeant of the Seventh Indiana\r\nInfantry stated his theory to me this way:\r\n\r\n“You know I’m just old lightnin’ on chuck-a-luck. Now the way I bet is\r\nthis: I lay down, say on the ace, an’ it don’t come up; I just double\r\nmy bet on the ace, an’ keep on doublin’ every time it loses, until at\r\nlast it comes up an’ then I win a bushel o’ money, and mebbe bust the\r\nbank. You see the thing’s got to come up some time; an’ every time it\r\ndon’t come up makes it more likely to come up the next time. It’s just\r\nthe same way with this ’ere exchange. The thing’s got to happen some\r\nday, an’ every day that it don’t happen increases the chances that it\r\nwill happen the next day.”\r\n\r\nSome months later I folded the sanguine Sergeant’s stiffening hands\r\ntogether across his fleshless ribs, and helped carry his body out to\r\nthe dead-house at Andersonville, in order to get a piece of wood to\r\ncook my ration of meal with.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 17th of February, 1864, we were ordered to get\r\nready to move at daybreak the next morning. We were certain this could\r\nmean nothing else than exchange, and our exaltation was such that we\r\ndid little sleeping that night. The morning was very cold, but we\r\nsang and joked as we marched over the creaking bridge, on our way to\r\nthe cars. We were packed so tightly in these that it was impossible\r\nto even sit down, and we rolled slow ly away after a wheezing engine\r\nto Petersburg, whence we expected to march to the exchange post. We\r\nreached Petersburg before noon, and the cars halted there along time,\r\nwe momentarily expecting an order to get out. Then the train started up\r\nand moved out of the City toward the southeast. This was inexplicable,\r\nbut after we had proceeded this way for several hours some one\r\nconceived the idea that the Rebels, to avoid treating with Butler, were\r\ntaking us into the Department of some other commander to exchange us.\r\nThis explanation satisfied us, and our spirits rose again.\r\n\r\nNight found us at Gaston, N. C., where we received a few crackers for\r\nrations, and changed cars. It was dark, and we resorted to a little\r\nstrategy to secure more room. About thirty of us got into a tight\r\nbox car, and immediately announced that it was too full to admit any\r\nmore. When an officer came along with another squad to stow away, we\r\nwould yell out to him to take some of the men out, as we were crowded\r\nunbearably. In the mean time everybody in the car would pack closely\r\naround the door, so as to give the impression that the car was densely\r\ncrowded. The Rebel would look convinced, and demand:\r\n\r\n“Why, how many men have you got in de cah?”\r\n\r\nThen one of us would order the imaginary host in the invisible recesses\r\nto--\r\n\r\n“Stand still there, and be counted,” while he would gravely count up to\r\none hundred or one hundred and twenty, which was the utmost limit of\r\nthe car, and the Rebel would hurry off to put his prisoners somewhere\r\nelse. We managed to play this successfully during the whole journey,\r\nand not only obtained room to lie down in the car, but also drew three\r\nor four times as many rations as were intended for us, so that while we\r\nat no time had enough, we were farther from starvation than our less\r\nstrategic companions.\r\n\r\nThe second afternoon we arrived at Raleigh, the capitol of North\r\nCarolina, and were camped in a piece of timber, and shortly after dark\r\norders were issued to us all to lie flat on the ground and not rise up\r\ntill daylight. About the middle of the night a man belonging to a New\r\nJersey regiment, who had apparently forgotten the order, stood up, and\r\nwas immediately shot dead by the guard.\r\n\r\nFor four or five days more the decrepit little locomotive strained\r\nalong, dragging after it the rattling’ old cars. The scenery was\r\nintensely monotonous. It was a flat, almost unending, stretch of pine\r\nbarrens and the land so poor that a disgusted Illinoisan, used to the\r\nfertility of the great American Bottom, said rather strongly, that,\r\n\r\n“By George, they’d have to manure this ground before they could even\r\nmake brick out of it.”\r\n\r\nIt was a surprise to all of us who had heard so much of the wealth of\r\nVirginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, to find the soil\r\na sterile sand bank, interspersed with swamps.\r\n\r\nWe had still no idea of where we were going. We only knew that our\r\ngeneral course was southward, and that we had passed through the\r\nCarolinas, and were in Georgia. We furbished up our school knowledge\r\nof geography and endeavored to recall something of the location of\r\nRaleigh, Charlotte, Columbia and Augusta, through which we passed, but\r\nthe attempt was not a success.\r\n\r\nLate on the afternoon of the 25th of February the Seventh Indiana\r\nSergeant approached me with the inquiry:\r\n\r\n“Do you know where Macon is?”\r\n\r\nThe place had not then become as well known as it was afterward.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that I had read something of Macon in Revolutionary\r\nhistory, and that it was a fort on the sea coast. He said that the\r\nguard had told him that we were to be taken to a point near that place,\r\nand we agreed that it was probably a new place of exchange. A little\r\nlater we passed through the town of Macon, Ga, and turned upon a road\r\nthat led almost due south.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight the train stopped, and we were ordered off. We were in\r\nthe midst of a forest of tall trees that loaded the air with the heavy\r\nbalsamic odor peculiar to pine trees. A few small rude houses were\r\nscattered around near.\r\n\r\nStretching out into the darkness was a double row of great heaps of\r\nburning pitch pine, that smoked and flamed fiercely, and lit up a\r\nlittle space around in the somber forest with a ruddy glare. Between\r\nthese two rows lay a road, which we were ordered to take.\r\n\r\nThe scene was weird and uncanny. I had recently read the “Iliad,” and\r\nthe long lines of huge fires reminded me of that scene in the first\r\nbook, where the Greeks burn on the sea shore the bodies of those\r\nsmitten by Apollo’s pestilential-arrows\r\n\r\n          For nine long nights, through all the dusky air,\r\n          The pyres, thick flaming shot a dismal glare.\r\n\r\nFive hundred weary men moved along slowly through double lines of\r\nguards. Five hundred men marched silently towards the gates that were\r\nto shut out life and hope from most of them forever. A quarter of a\r\nmile from the railroad we came to a massive palisade of great squared\r\nlogs standing upright in the ground. The fires blazed up and showed\r\nus a section of these, and two massive wooden gates, with heavy iron\r\nhinges and bolts. They swung open as we stood there and we passed\r\nthrough into the space beyond.\r\n\r\nWe were in Andersonville.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nGEORGIA--A LEAN AND HUNGRY LAND--DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UPPER AND LOWER\r\nGEORGIA--THE PILLAGE OF ANDERSONVILLE.\r\n\r\nAs the next nine months of the existence of those of us who survived\r\nwere spent in intimate connection with the soil of Georgia, and, as it\r\nexercised a potential influence upon our comfort and well-being, or\r\nrather lack of these--a mention of some of its peculiar characteristics\r\nmay help the reader to a fuller comprehension of the conditions\r\nsurrounding us--our environment, as Darwin would say.\r\n\r\nGeorgia, which, next to Texas, is the largest State in the South, and\r\nhas nearly twenty-five per cent. more area than the great State of New\r\nYork, is divided into two distinct and widely differing sections, by a\r\ngeological line extending directly across the State from Augusta, on\r\nthe Savannah River, through Macon, on the Ocmulgee, to Columbus, on the\r\nChattahoochie. That part lying to the north and west of this line is\r\nusually spoken of as “Upper Georgia;” while that lying to the south and\r\neast, extending to the Atlantic Ocean and the Florida line, is called\r\n“Lower Georgia.” In this part of the State--though far removed from\r\neach other--were the prisons of Andersonville, Savannah, Millen and\r\nBlackshear, in which we were incarcerated one after the other.\r\n\r\nUpper Georgia--the capital of which is Atlanta--is a fruitful,\r\nproductive, metalliferous region, that will in time become quite\r\nwealthy. Lower Georgia, which has an extent about equal to that of\r\nIndiana, is not only poorer now than a worn-out province of Asia Minor,\r\nbut in all probability will ever remain so.\r\n\r\nIt is a starved, sterile land, impressing one as a desert in the first\r\nstages of reclamation into productive soil, or a productive soil in\r\nthe last steps of deterioration into a desert. It is a vast expanse\r\nof arid, yellow sand, broken at intervals by foul swamps, with a\r\njungle-life growth of unwholesome vegetation, and teeming With venomous\r\nsnakes, and all manner of hideous crawling thing.\r\n\r\nThe original forest still stands almost unbroken on this wide stretch\r\nof thirty thousand square miles, but it does not cover it as we say\r\nof forests in more favored lands. The tall, solemn pines, upright and\r\nsymmetrical as huge masts, and wholly destitute of limbs, except the\r\nlittle, umbrella-like crest at the very top, stand far apart from each\r\nother in an unfriendly isolation. There is no fraternal interlacing of\r\nbranches to form a kindly, umbrageous shadow. Between them is no genial\r\nundergrowth of vines, shrubs, and demi-trees, generous in fruits,\r\nberries and nuts, such as make one of the charms of Northern forests.\r\nOn the ground is no rich, springing sod of emerald green, fragrant\r\nwith the elusive sweetness of white clover, and dainty flowers, but\r\na sparse, wiry, famished grass, scattered thinly over the surface in\r\ntufts and patches, like the hair on a mangy cur.\r\n\r\nThe giant pines seem to have sucked up into their immense boles all the\r\nnutriment in the earth, and starved out every minor growth. So wide and\r\nclean is the space between them, that one can look through the forest\r\nin any direction for miles, with almost as little interference with the\r\nview as on a prairie. In the swampier parts the trees are lower, and\r\ntheir limbs are hung with heavy festoons of the gloomy Spanish moss, or\r\n“death moss,” as it is more frequently called, because where it grows\r\nrankest the malaria is the deadliest. Everywhere Nature seems sad,\r\nsubdued and somber.\r\n\r\nI have long entertained a peculiar theory to account for the decadence\r\nand ruin of countries. My reading of the world’s history seems to teach\r\nme that when a strong people take possession of a fertile land, they\r\nreduce it to cultivation, thrive upon its bountifulness, multiply into\r\nmillions the mouths to be fed from it, tax it to the last limit of\r\nproduction of the necessities of life, take from it continually, and\r\ngive nothing back, starve and overwork it as cruel, grasping men do a\r\nservant or a beast, and when at last it breaks down under the strain,\r\nit revenges itself by starving many of them with great famines, while\r\nthe others go off in search of new countries to put through the same\r\nprocess of exhaustion. We have seen one country after another undergo\r\nthis process as the seat of empire took its westward way, from the\r\ncradle of the race on the banks of the Oxus to the fertile plains in\r\nthe Valley of the Euphrates. Impoverishing these, men next sought the\r\nValley of the Nile, then the Grecian Peninsula; next Syracuse and the\r\nItalian Peninsula, then the Iberian Peninsula, and the African shores\r\nof the Mediterranean. Exhausting all these, they were deserted for the\r\nFrench, German and English portions of Europe. The turn of the latter\r\nis now come; famines are becoming terribly frequent, and mankind is\r\npouring into the virgin fields of America.\r\n\r\nLower Georgia, the Carolinas and Eastern Virginia have all the\r\ncharacteristics of these starved and worn-out lands. It would seem as\r\nif, away back in the distance of ages, some numerous and civilized race\r\nhad drained from the soil the last atom of food-producing constituents,\r\nand that it is now slowly gathering back, as the centuries pass, the\r\nelements that have been wrung from the land.\r\n\r\nLower Georgia is very thinly settled. Much of the land is still in\r\nthe hands of the Government. The three or four railroads which pass\r\nthrough it have little reference to local traffic. There are no towns\r\nalong them as a rule; stations are made every ten miles, and not named,\r\nbut numbered, as “Station No. 4”--“No. 10”, etc. The roads were built\r\nas through lines, to bring to the seaboard the rich products of the\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\nAndersonville is one of the few stations dignified with a same,\r\nprobably because it contained some half dozen of shabby houses, whereas\r\nat the others there was usually nothing more than a mere open shed, to\r\nshelter goods and travelers. It is on a rudely constructed, rickety\r\nrailroad, that runs from Macon to Albany, the head of navigation on\r\nthe Flint River, which is, one hundred and six miles from Macon, and\r\ntwo hundred and fifty from the Gulf of Mexico. Andersonville is about\r\nsixty miles from Macon, and, consequently, about three hundred miles\r\nfrom the Gulf. The camp was merely a hole cut in the wilderness. It was\r\nas remote a point from, our armies, as they then lay, as the Southern\r\nConfederacy could give. The nearest was Sherman, at Chattanooga, four\r\nhundred miles away, and on the other side of a range of mountains\r\nhundreds of miles wide.\r\n\r\nTo us it seemed beyond the last forlorn limits of civilization. We felt\r\nthat we were more completely at the mercy of our foes than ever. While\r\nin Richmond we were in the heart of the Confederacy; we were in the\r\nmidst of the Rebel military and, civil force, and were surrounded on\r\nevery hand by visible evidences of the great magnitude of that power,\r\nbut this, while it enforced our ready submission, did not overawe us\r\ndepressingly, We knew that though the Rebels were all about us in great\r\nforce, our own men were also near, and in still greater force--that\r\nwhile they were very strong our army was still stronger, and there was\r\nno telling what day this superiority of strength, might be demonstrated\r\nin such a way as to decisively benefit us.\r\n\r\nBut here we felt as did the Ancient Mariner:\r\n\r\n               Alone on a wide, wide sea,\r\n               So lonely ’twas that God himself\r\n               Scarce seemed there to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nWAKING UP IN ANDERSONVILLE--SOME DESCRIPTION OF THE PLACE--OUR FIRST\r\nMAIL--BUILDING SHELTER--GEN. WINDER--HIMSELF AND LINEAGE.\r\n\r\nWe roused up promptly with the dawn to take a survey of our new abiding\r\nplace. We found ourselves in an immense pen, about one thousand feet\r\nlong by eight hundred wide, as a young surveyor--a member of the\r\nThirty-fourth Ohio--informed us after he had paced it off. He estimated\r\nthat it contained about sixteen acres. The walls were formed by pine\r\nlogs twenty-five feet long, from two to three feet in diameter, hewn\r\nsquare, set into the ground to a depth of five feet, and placed so\r\nclose together as to leave no crack through which the country outside\r\ncould be seen. There being five feet of the logs in the ground, the\r\nwall was, of course, twenty feet high. This manner of enclosure was in\r\nsome respects superior to a wall of masonry. It was equally unscalable,\r\nand much more difficult to undermine or batter down.\r\n\r\nThe pen was longest due north and south. It was divided in the center\r\nby a creek about a yard wide and ten inches deep, running from west to\r\neast. On each side of this was a quaking bog of slimy ooze one hundred\r\nand fifty feet wide, and so yielding that one attempting to walk upon\r\nit would sink to the waist. From this swamp the sand-hills sloped north\r\nand south to the stockade. All the trees inside the stockade, save two,\r\nhad been cut down and used in its construction. All the rank vegetation\r\nof the swamp had also been cut off.\r\n\r\nThere were two entrances to the stockade, one on each side of the\r\ncreek, midway between it and the ends, and called respectively the\r\n“North Gate” and the “South Gate.” These were constructed double, by\r\nbuilding smaller stockades around them on the outside, with another\r\nset of gates. When prisoners or wagons with rations were brought in,\r\nthey were first brought inside the outer gates, which were carefully\r\nsecured, before the inner gates were opened. This was done to prevent\r\nthe gates being carried by a rush by those confined inside.\r\n\r\nAt regular intervals along the palisades were little perches, upon\r\nwhich stood guards, who overlooked the whole inside of the prison.\r\n\r\nThe only view we had of the outside was that obtained by looking from\r\nthe highest points of the North or South Sides across the depression\r\nwhere the stockade crossed the swamp. In this way we could see about\r\nforty acres at a time of the adjoining woodland, or say one hundred and\r\nsixty acres altogether, and this meager landscape had to content us for\r\nthe next half year.\r\n\r\nBefore our inspection was finished, a wagon drove in with rations, and\r\na quart of meal, a sweet potato and a few ounces of salt beef were\r\nissued to each one of us.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes we were all hard at work preparing our first meal in\r\nAndersonville. The debris of the forest left a temporary abundance\r\nof fuel, and we had already a cheerful fire blazing for every little\r\nsquad. There were a number of tobacco presses in the rooms we occupied\r\nin Richmond, and to each of these was a quantity of sheets of tin,\r\nevidently used to put between the layers of tobacco. The deft hands of\r\nthe mechanics among us bent these up into square pans, which were real\r\nhandy cooking utensils, holding about--a quart. Water was carried in\r\nthem from the creek; the meal mixed in them to a dough, or else boiled\r\nas mush in the same vessels; the potatoes were boiled; and their final\r\nservice was to hold a little meal to be carefully browned, and then\r\nwater boiled upon it, so as to form a feeble imitation of coffee. I\r\nfound my education at Jonesville in the art of baking a hoe-cake now\r\ncame in good play, both for myself and companions. Taking one of the\r\npieces of tin which had not yet been made into a pan, we spread upon\r\nit a layer of dough about a half-inch thick. Propping this up nearly\r\nupright before the fire, it was soon nicely browned over. This process\r\nmade it sweat itself loose from the tin, when it was turned over and\r\nthe bottom browned also. Save that it was destitute of salt, it was\r\nquite a toothsome bit of nutriment for a hungry man, and I recommend my\r\nreaders to try making a “pone” of this kind once, just to see what it\r\nwas like.\r\n\r\nThe supreme indifference with which the Rebels always treated the\r\nmatter of cooking utensils for us, excited my wonder. It never seemed\r\nto occur to them that we could have any more need of vessels for our\r\nfood than cattle or swine. Never, during my whole prison life, did I\r\nsee so much as a tin cup or a bucket issued to a prisoner. Starving men\r\nwere driven to all sorts of shifts for want of these. Pantaloons or\r\ncoats were pulled off and their sleeves or legs used to draw a mess’s\r\nmeal in. Boots were common vessels for carrying water, and when the\r\nfeet of these gave way the legs were ingeniously closed up with pine\r\npegs, so as to form rude leathern buckets. Men whose pocket knives had\r\nescaped the search at the gates made very ingenious little tubs and\r\nbuckets, and these devices enabled us to get along after a fashion.\r\n\r\nAfter our meal was disposed of, we held a council on the situation.\r\nThough we had been sadly disappointed in not being exchanged, it\r\nseemed that on the whole our condition had been bettered. This first\r\nration was a decided improvement on those of the Pemberton building;\r\nwe had left the snow and ice behind at Richmond--or rather at some\r\nplace between Raleigh, N. C., and Columbia, S. C.--and the air here,\r\nthough chill, was not nipping, but bracing. It looked as if we would\r\nhave a plenty of wood for shelter and fuel, it was certainly better\r\nto have sixteen acres to roam over than the stiffing confines of a\r\nbuilding; and, still better, it seemed as if there would be plenty of\r\nopportunities to get beyond the stockade, and attempt a journey through\r\nthe woods to that blissful land --“Our lines.”\r\n\r\nWe settled down to make the best of things. A Rebel Sergeant came\r\nin presently and arranged us in hundreds. We subdivided these into\r\nmesses of twenty-five, and began devising means for shelter. Nothing\r\nshowed the inborn capacity of the Northern soldier to take care of\r\nhimself better than the way in which we accomplished this with the\r\nrude materials at our command. No ax, spade nor mattock was allowed\r\nus by the Rebels, who treated us in regard to these the same as in\r\nrespect to culinary vessels. The only tools were a few pocket-knives,\r\nand perhaps half-a-dozen hatchets which some infantrymen-principally\r\nmembers of the Third Michigan--were allowed to retain. Yet, despite\r\nall these drawbacks, we had quite a village of huts erected in a few\r\ndays,--nearly enough, in fact, to afford tolerable shelter for the\r\nwhole five hundred of us first-comers.\r\n\r\nThe wither and poles that grew in the swamp were bent into the shape\r\nof the semi-circular bows that support the canvas covers of army\r\nwagons, and both ends thrust in the ground. These formed the timbers\r\nof our dwellings. They were held in place by weaving in, basket-wise,\r\na network of briers and vines. Tufts of the long leaves which are the\r\ndistinguishing characteristic of the Georgia pine (popularly known as\r\nthe “long-leaved pine”) were wrought into this network until a thatch\r\nwas formed, that was a fair protection against the rain--it was like\r\nthe Irishman’s unglazed window-sash, which “kep’ out the coarsest uv\r\nthe cold.”\r\n\r\nThe results accomplished were as astonishing to us as to the Rebels,\r\nwho would have lain unsheltered upon the sand until bleached out like\r\nfield-rotted flax, before thinking to protect themselves in this\r\nway. As our village was approaching completion, the Rebel Sergeant\r\nwho called the roll entered. He was very odd-looking. The cervical\r\nmuscles were distorted in such a way as to suggest to us the name of\r\n“Wry-necked Smith,” by which we always designated him. Pete Bates, of\r\nthe Third Michigan, who was the wag of our squad, accounted for Smith’s\r\ncondition by saying that while on dress parade once the Colonel of\r\nSmith’s regiment had commanded “eyes right,” and then forgot to give\r\nthe order “front.” Smith, being a good soldier, had kept his eyes in\r\nthe position of gazing at the buttons of the third man to the right,\r\nwaiting for the order to restore them to their natural direction,\r\nuntil they had become permanently fixed in their obliquity and he was\r\ncompelled to go through life taking a biased view of all things.\r\n\r\nSmith walked in, made a diagonal survey of the encampment, which, if\r\nhe had ever seen “Mitchell’s Geography,” probably reminded him of the\r\npicture of a Kaffir village, in that instructive but awfully dull book,\r\nand then expressed the opinion that usually welled up to every Rebel’s\r\nlips:\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ll be durned, if you Yanks don’t just beat the devil.”\r\n\r\nOf course, we replied with the well-worn prison joke, that we supposed\r\nwe did, as we beat the Rebels, who were worse than the devil.\r\n\r\nThere rode in among us, a few days after our arrival, an old man whose\r\ncollar bore the wreathed stars of a Major General. Heavy white locks\r\nfell from beneath his slouched hat, nearly to his shoulders. Sunken\r\ngray eyes, too dull and cold to light up, marked a hard, stony face,\r\nthe salient feature of which was a thin-upped, compressed mouth, with\r\ncorners drawn down deeply--the mouth which seems the world over to be\r\nthe index of selfish, cruel, sulky malignance. It is such a mouth as\r\nhas the school-boy--the coward of the play ground, who delights in\r\npulling off the wings of flies. It is such a mouth as we can imagine\r\nsome remorseless inquisitor to have had--that is, not an inquisitor\r\nfilled with holy zeal for what he mistakenly thought the cause of\r\nChrist demanded, but a spleeny, envious, rancorous shaveling, who\r\ntortured men from hatred of their superiority to him, and sheer love of\r\ninflicting pain.\r\n\r\nThe rider was John H. Winder, Commissary General of Prisoners,\r\nBaltimorean renegade and the malign genius to whose account should be\r\ncharged the deaths of more gallant men than all the inquisitors of the\r\nworld ever slew by the less dreadful rack and wheel. It was he who in\r\nAugust could point to the three thousand and eighty-one new made graves\r\nfor that month, and exultingly tell his hearer that he was “doing more\r\nfor the Confederacy than twenty regiments.”\r\n\r\nHis lineage was in accordance with his character. His father was that\r\nGeneral William H. Winder, whose poltroonery at Bladensburg, in 1814,\r\nnullified the resistance of the gallant Commodore Barney, and gave\r\nWashington to the British.\r\n\r\nThe father was a coward and an incompetent; the son, always cautiously\r\ndistant from the scene of hostilities, was the tormentor of those whom\r\nthe fortunes of war, and the arms of brave men threw into his hands.\r\n\r\nWinder gazed at us stonily for a few minutes without speaking, and,\r\nturning, rode out again.\r\n\r\nOur troubles, from that hour, rapidly increased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE PLANTATION NEGROS--NOT STUPID TO BE LOYAL--THEIR DITHYRAMBIC MUSIC\r\n--COPPERHEAD OPINION OF LONGFELLOW.\r\n\r\nThe stockade was not quite finished at the time of our arrival--a gap\r\nof several hundred feet appearing at the southwest corner. A gang of\r\nabout two hundred negros were at work felling trees, hewing legs, and\r\nplacing them upright in the trenches. We had an opportunity--soon\r\nto disappear forever--of studying the workings of the “peculiar\r\ninstitution” in its very home. The negros were of the lowest field-hand\r\nclass, strong, dull, ox-like, but each having in our eyes an admixture\r\nof cunning and secretiveness that their masters pretended was not in\r\nthem. Their demeanor toward us illustrated this. We were the objects\r\nof the most supreme interest to them, but when near us and in the\r\npresence of a white Rebel, this interest took the shape of stupid,\r\nopen-eyed, open-mouthed wonder, something akin to the look on the face\r\nof the rustic lout, gazing for the first time upon a locomotive or a\r\nsteam threshing machine. But if chance threw one of them near us when\r\nhe thought himself unobserved by the Rebels, the blank, vacant face\r\nlighted up with an entirely different expression. He was no longer the\r\ncredulous yokel who believed the Yankees were only slightly modified\r\ndevils, ready at any instant to return to their original horn-and-tail\r\ncondition and snatch him away to the bluest kind of perdition; he knew,\r\napparently quite as well as his master, that they were in some way his\r\nfriends and allies, and he lost no opportunity in communicating his\r\nappreciation of that fact, and of offering his services in any possible\r\nway. And these offers were sincere. It is the testimony of every Union\r\nprisoner in the South that he was never betrayed by or disappointed in\r\na field-negro, but could always approach any one of them with perfect\r\nconfidence in his extending all the aid in his power, whether as a\r\nguide to escape, as sentinel to signal danger, or a purveyor of food.\r\nThese services were frequently attended with the greatest personal\r\nrisk, but they were none the less readily undertaken. This applies only\r\nto the field-hands; the house servants were treacherous and wholly\r\nunreliable. Very many of our men who managed to get away from the\r\nprisons were recaptured through their betrayal by house servants, but\r\nnone were retaken where a field hand could prevent it.\r\n\r\nWe were much interested in watching the negro work. They wove in a\r\ngreat deal of their peculiar, wild, mournful music, whenever the\r\ncharacter of the labor permitted. They seemed to sing the music for\r\nthe music’s sake alone, and were as heedless of the fitness of the\r\naccompanying words, as the composer of a modern opera is of his\r\nlibretto. One middle aged man, with a powerful, mellow baritone, like\r\nthe round, full notes of a French horn, played by a virtuoso, was the\r\nmusical leader of the party. He never seemed to bother himself about\r\nair, notes or words, but improvised all as he went along, and he sang\r\nas the spirit moved him. He would suddenly break out with--\r\n\r\n     “Oh, he’s gone up dah, nevah to come back agin,”\r\n\r\nAt this every darkey within hearing would roll out, in admirable\r\nconsonance with the pitch, air and time started by the leader--\r\n\r\n     “O-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!”\r\n\r\nThen would ring out from the leader as from the throbbing lips of a\r\nsilver trumpet,\r\n\r\n     “Lord bress him soul; I done hope he is happy now!”\r\n\r\nAnd the antiphonal two hundred would chant back\r\n\r\n     “O-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!”\r\n\r\nAnd so on for hours. They never seemed to weary of singing, and we\r\ncertainly did not of listening to them. The absolute independence\r\nof the conventionalities of tune and sentiment, gave them freedom\r\nto wander through a kaleideoscopic variety of harmonic effects, as\r\nspontaneous and changeful as the song of a bird.\r\n\r\nI sat one evening, long after the shadows of night had fallen upon the\r\nhillside, with one of my chums--a Frank Berkstresser, of the Ninth\r\nMaryland Infantry, who before enlisting was a mathematical tutor in\r\ncollege at Hancock, Maryland. As we listened to the unwearying flow of\r\nmelody from the camp of the laborers, I thought of and repeated to him\r\nLongfellow’s fine lines:\r\n\r\nTHE SLAVE SINGING AT MIDNIGHT.\r\n\r\nAnd the voice of his devotion\r\nFilled my soul with strong emotion;\r\nFor its tones by turns were glad\r\nSweetly solemn, wildly sad.\r\n\r\n          Paul and Silas, in their prison,\r\n          Sang of Christ, the Lord arisen,\r\n          And an earthquake’s arm of might\r\n          Broke their dungeon gates at night.\r\n\r\n          But, alas, what holy angel\r\n          Brings the slave this glad evangel\r\n          And what earthquake’s arm of might.\r\n          Breaks his prison gags at night.\r\n\r\nSaid I: “Now, isn’t that fine, Berkstresser?”\r\n\r\nHe was a Democrat, of fearfully pro-slavery ideas, and he replied,\r\nsententiously:\r\n\r\n“O, the poetry’s tolerable, but the sentiment’s damnable.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nSCHEMES AND PLANS TO ESCAPE--SCALING THE STOCKADE--ESTABLISHING THE\r\nDEAD LINE--THE FIRST MAN KILLED.\r\n\r\nThe official designation of our prison was “Camp Sumpter,” but this\r\nwas scarcely known outside of the Rebel documents, reports and orders.\r\nIt was the same way with the prison five miles from Millen, to which\r\nwe were afterward transferred. The Rebels styled it officially “Camp\r\nLawton,” but we called it always “Millen.”\r\n\r\nHaving our huts finished, the next solicitude was about escape,\r\nand this was the burden of our thoughts, day and night. We held\r\nconferences, at which every man was required to contribute all the\r\ngeographical knowledge of that section of Georgia that he might have\r\nleft over from his schoolboy days, and also that gained by persistent\r\nquestioning of such guards and other Rebels as he had come in contact\r\nwith. When first landed in the prison we were as ignorant of our\r\nwhereabouts as if we had been dropped into the center of Africa. But\r\none of the prisoners was found to have a fragment of a school atlas,\r\nin which was an outline map of Georgia, that had Macon, Atlanta,\r\nMilledgeville, and Savannah laid down upon it. As we knew we had\r\ncome southward from Macon, we felt pretty certain we were in the\r\nsouthwestern corner of the State. Conversations with guards and others\r\ngave us the information that the Chattahooche flowed some two score of\r\nmiles to the westward, and that the Flint lay a little nearer on the\r\neast. Our map showed that these two united and flowed together into\r\nAppalachicola Bay, where, some of us remembered, a newspaper item had\r\nsaid that we had gunboats stationed. The creek that ran through the\r\nstockade flowed to the east, and we reasoned that if we followed its\r\ncourse we would be led to the Flint, down which we could float on a log\r\nor raft to the Appalachicola. This was the favorite scheme of the party\r\nwith which I sided. Another party believed the most feasible plan was\r\nto go northward, and endeavor to gain the mountains, and thence get\r\ninto East Tennessee.\r\n\r\nBut the main thing was to get away from the stockade; this, as the\r\nFrench say of all first steps, was what would cost.\r\n\r\nOur first attempt was made about a week after our arrival. We found two\r\nlogs on the east side that were a couple of feet shorter than the rest,\r\nand it seemed as if they could be successfully scaled. About fifty of\r\nus resolved to make the attempt. We made a rope twenty-five or thirty\r\nfeet long, and strong enough to bear a man, out of strings and strips\r\nof cloth. A stout stick was fastened to the end, so that it would catch\r\non the logs on either side of the gap. On a night dark enough to favor\r\nour scheme, we gathered together, drew cuts to determine each boy’s\r\nplace in the line, fell in single rank, according to this arrangement,\r\nand marched to the place. The line was thrown skillfully, the stick\r\ncaught fairly in the notch, and the boy who had drawn number one\r\nclimbed up amid a suspense so keen that I could hear my heart beating.\r\nIt seemed ages before he reached the top, and that the noise he made\r\nmust certainly attract the attention of the guard. It did not. We saw\r\nour comrade’s. figure outlined against the sky as he slid, over the\r\ntop, and then heard the dull thump as he sprang to the ground on the\r\nother side. “Number two,” was whispered by our leader, and he performed\r\nthe feat as successfully as his predecessor. “Number, three,” and he\r\nfollowed noiselessly and quickly. Thus it went on, until, just as we\r\nheard number fifteen drop, we also heard a Rebel voice say in a vicious\r\nundertone:\r\n\r\n“Halt! halt, there, d--n you!”\r\n\r\nThis was enough. The game was up; we were discovered, and the remaining\r\nthirty-five of us left that locality with all the speed in our heels,\r\ngetting away just in time to escape a volley which a squad of guards,\r\nposted in the lookouts, poured upon the spot where we had been standing.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the fifteen who had got over the Stockade were brought\r\nin, each chained to a sixty-four pound ball. Their story was that one\r\nof the N’Yaarkers, who had become cognizant of our scheme, had sought\r\nto obtain favor in the Rebel eyes by betraying us. The Rebels stationed\r\na squad at the crossing place, and as each man dropped down from the\r\nStockade he was caught by the shoulder, the muzzle of a revolver thrust\r\ninto his face, and an order to surrender whispered into his ear. It was\r\nexpected that the guards in the sentry-boxes would do such execution\r\namong those of us still inside as would prove a warning to other\r\nwould-be escapes. They were defeated in this benevolent intention by\r\nthe readiness with which we divined the meaning of that incautiously\r\nloud halt, and our alacrity in leaving the unhealthy locality.\r\n\r\nThe traitorous N’Yaarker was rewarded with a detail into the commissary\r\ndepartment, where he fed and fattened like a rat that had secured\r\nundisturbed homestead rights in the center of a cheese. When the\r\nmiserable remnant of us were leaving Andersonville months afterward,\r\nI saw him, sleek, rotund, and well-clothed, lounging leisurely in the\r\ndoor of a tent. He regarded us a moment contemptuously, and then went\r\non conversing with a fellow N’Yaarker, in the foul slang that none but\r\nsuch as he were low enough to use.\r\n\r\nI have always imagined that the fellow returned home, at the close of\r\nthe war, and became a prominent member of Tweed’s gang.\r\n\r\nWe protested against the barbarity of compelling men to wear irons\r\nfor exercising their natural right of attempting to escape, but no\r\nattention was paid to our protest.\r\n\r\nAnother result of this abortive effort was the establishment of the\r\nnotorious “Dead Line.” A few days later a gang of negros came in and\r\ndrove a line of stakes down at a distance of twenty feet from the\r\nstockade. They nailed upon this a strip of stuff four inches wide, and\r\nthen an order was issued that if this was crossed, or even touched, the\r\nguards would fire upon the offender without warning.\r\n\r\nOur surveyor figured up this new contraction of our space, and came to\r\nthe conclusion that the Dead Line and the Swamp took up about three\r\nacres, and we were left now only thirteen acres. This was not of much\r\nconsequence then, however, as we still had plenty of room.\r\n\r\nThe first man was killed the morning after the Dead-Line was put up.\r\nThe victim was a German, wearing the white crescent of the Second\r\nDivision of the Eleventh Corps, whom we had nicknamed “Sigel.” Hardship\r\nand exposure had crazed him, and brought on a severe attack of St.\r\nVitus’s dance. As he went hobbling around with a vacuous grin upon\r\nhis face, he spied an old piece of cloth lying on the ground inside\r\nthe Dead Line. He stooped down and reached under for it. At that\r\ninstant the guard fired. The charge of ball-and-buck entered the poor\r\nold fellow’s shoulder and tore through his body. He fell dead, still\r\nclutching the dirty rag that had cost him his Life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nCAPT. HENRI WIRZ--SOME DESCRIPTION OF A SMALL-MINDED PERSONAGE, WHO\r\nGAINED GREAT NOTORIETY--FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH HIS DISCIPLINARY METHOD.\r\n\r\nThe emptying of the prisons at Danville and Richmond into Andersonville\r\nwent on slowly during the month of March. They came in by train loads\r\nof from five hundred to eight hundred, at intervals of two or three\r\ndays. By the end of the month there were about five thousand in the\r\nstockade. There was a fair amount of space for this number, and as yet\r\nwe suffered no inconvenience from our crowding, though most persons\r\nwould fancy that thirteen acres of ground was a rather limited area for\r\nfive thousand men to live, move and have their being a upon. Yet a few\r\nweeks later we were to see seven times that many packed into that space.\r\n\r\nOne morning a new Rebel officer came in to superintend calling the\r\nroll. He was an undersized, fidgety man, with an insignificant face,\r\nand a mouth that protruded like a rabbit’s. His bright little eyes,\r\nlike those of a squirrel or a rat, assisted in giving his countenance\r\na look of kinship to the family of rodent animals--a genus which\r\nlives by stealth and cunning, subsisting on that which it can steal\r\naway from stronger and braver creatures. He was dressed in a pair of\r\ngray trousers, with the other part of his body covered with a calico\r\ngarment, like that which small boys used to wear, called “waists.”\r\nThis was fastened to the pantaloons by buttons, precisely as was the\r\ncustom with the garments of boys struggling with the orthography of\r\nwords in two syllables. Upon his head was perched a little gray cap.\r\nSticking in his belt, and fastened to his wrist by a strap two or three\r\nfeet long, was one of those formidable looking, but harmless English\r\nrevolvers, that have ten barrels around the edge of the cylinder, and\r\nfire a musket-bullet from the center. The wearer of this composite\r\ncostume, and bearer of this amateur arsenal, stepped nervously about\r\nand sputtered volubly in very broken English. He said to Wry-Necked\r\nSmith:\r\n\r\n“Py Gott, you don’t vatch dem dam Yankees glose enough! Dey are\r\nschlippin’ rount, and peatin’ you efery dimes.”\r\n\r\nThis was Captain Henri Wirz, the new commandant of the interior of\r\nthe prison. There has been a great deal of misapprehension of the\r\ncharacter of Wirz. He is usually regarded as a villain of large mental\r\ncaliber, and with a genius for cruelty. He was nothing of the kind. He\r\nwas simply contemptible, from whatever point of view he was studied.\r\nGnat-brained, cowardly, and feeble natured, he had not a quality that\r\ncommanded respect from any one who knew him. His cruelty did not seem\r\ndesigned so much as the ebullitions of a peevish, snarling little\r\ntemper, united to a mind incapable of conceiving the results of his\r\nacts, or understanding the pain he was Inflicting.\r\n\r\nI never heard anything of his profession or vocation before entering\r\nthe army. I always believed, however, that he had been a cheap clerk\r\nin a small dry-goods store, a third or fourth rate book-keeper, or\r\nsomething similar. Imagine, if you please, one such, who never had\r\nbrains or self-command sufficient to control himself, placed in command\r\nof thirty-five thousand men. Being a fool he could not help being an\r\ninfliction to them, even with the best of intentions, and Wirz was not\r\ntroubled with good intentions.\r\n\r\nI mention the probability of his having been a dry-goods clerk or\r\nbook-keeper, not with any disrespect to two honorable vocations, but\r\nbecause Wirz had had some training as an accountant, and this was\r\nwhat gave him the place over us. Rebels, as a rule, are astonishingly\r\nignorant of arithmetic and accounting, generally. They are good shots,\r\nfine horsemen, ready speakers and ardent politicians, but, like all\r\nnoncommercial people, they flounder hopelessly in what people of this\r\nsection would consider simple mathematical processes. One of our\r\nconstant amusements was in befogging and “beating” those charged with\r\ncalling rolls and issuing rations. It was not at all difficult at times\r\nto make a hundred men count as a hundred and ten, and so on.\r\n\r\nWirz could count beyond one hundred, and this determined his selection\r\nfor the place. His first move was a stupid change. We had been grouped\r\nin the natural way into hundreds and thousands. He re-arranged the men\r\nin “squads” of ninety, and three of these--two hundred and seventy men\r\n--into a “detachment.” The detachments were numbered in order from the\r\nNorth Gate, and the squads were numbered “one, two, three.” On the\r\nrolls this was stated after the man’s name. For instance, a chum of\r\nmine, and in the same squad with me, was Charles L. Soule, of the Third\r\nMichigan Infantry. His name appeared on the rolls:\r\n\r\n“Chas. L. Soule, priv. Co. E, 8d Mich. Inf., 1-2.”\r\n\r\nThat is, he belonged to the Second Squad of the First Detachment.\r\n\r\nWhere Wirz got his, preposterous idea of organization from has always\r\nbeen a mystery to me. It was awkward in every way--in drawing rations,\r\ncounting, dividing into messes, etc.\r\n\r\nWirz was not long in giving us a taste of his quality. The next morning\r\nafter his first appearance he came in when roll-call was sounded, and\r\nordered all the squads and detachments to form, and remain standing in\r\nranks until all were counted. Any soldier will say that there is no\r\nduty more annoying and difficult than standing still in ranks for any\r\nconsiderable length of time, especially when there is nothing to do\r\nor to engage the attention. It took Wirz between two and three hours\r\nto count the whole camp, and by that time we of the first detachments\r\nwere almost all out of ranks. Thereupon Wirz announced that no rations\r\nwould be issued to the camp that day. The orders to stand in ranks\r\nwere repeated the next morning, with a warning that a failure to obey\r\nwould be punished as that of the previous day had been. Though we were\r\nso hungry, that, to use the words of a Thirty-Fifth Pennsylvanian\r\nstanding next to me--his “big intestines were eating his little ones\r\nup,” it was impossible to keep the rank formation during the long\r\nhours. One man after another straggled away, and again we lost our\r\nrations. That afternoon we became desperate. Plots were considered for\r\na daring assault to force the gates or scale the stockade. The men were\r\ncrazy enough to attempt anything rather than sit down and patiently\r\nstarve. Many offered themselves as leaders in any attempt that it might\r\nbe thought best to make. The hopelessness of any such venture was\r\napparent, even to famished men, and the propositions went no farther\r\nthan inflammatory talk.\r\n\r\nThe third morning the orders were again repeated. This time we\r\nsucceeded in remaining in ranks in such a manner as to satisfy Wirz,\r\nand we were given our rations for that day, but those of the other days\r\nwere permanently withheld.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon Wirz ventured into camp alone. He was assailed with a\r\nstorm of curses and execrations, and a shower of clubs. He pulled out\r\nhis revolver, as if to fire upon his assailants. A yell was raised to\r\ntake his pistol away from him and a crowd rushed forward to do this.\r\nWithout waiting to fire a shot, he turned and ran to the gate for dear\r\nlife. He did not come in again for a long while, and never afterward\r\nwithout a retinue of guards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nPRIZE-FIGHT AMONG THE N’YAARKERS--A GREAT MANY FORMALITIES, AND LITTLE\r\nBLOOD SPILT--A FUTILE ATTEMPT TO RECOVER A WATCH--DEFEAT OF THE LAW AND\r\nORDER PARTY.\r\n\r\nOne of the train-loads from Richmond was almost wholly made up of our\r\nold acquaintances--the N’Yaarkers. The number of these had swelled to\r\nfour hundred or five hundred--all leagued together in the fellowship of\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\nWe did not manifest any keen desire for intimate social relations with\r\nthem, and they did not seem to hunger for our society, so they moved\r\nacross the creek to the unoccupied South Side, and established their\r\ncamp there, at a considerable distance from us.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon a number of us went across to their camp, to witness\r\na fight according to the rules of the Prize Ring, which was to come\r\noff between two professional pugilists. These were a couple of\r\nbounty-jumpers who had some little reputation in New York sporting\r\ncircles, under the names of the “Staleybridge Chicken” and the “Haarlem\r\nInfant.”\r\n\r\nOn the way from Richmond a cast-iron skillet, or spider, had been\r\nstolen by the crowd from the Rebels. It was a small affair, holding a\r\nhalf gallon, and worth to-day about fifty cents. In Andersonville its\r\nworth was literally above rubies. Two men belonging to different messes\r\neach claimed the ownership of the utensil, on the ground of being\r\nmost active in securing it. Their claims were strenuously supported\r\nby their respective messes, at the heads of which were the aforesaid\r\nInfant and Chicken. A great deal of strong talk, and several indecisive\r\nknock-downs resulted in an agreement to settle the matter by wager of\r\nbattle between the Infant and Chicken.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived a twenty-four foot ring had been prepared by drawing\r\na deep mark in the sand. In diagonally opposite corners of these the\r\nseconds were kneeling on one knee and supporting their principals on\r\nthe other by their sides they had little vessels of water, and bundles\r\nof rags to answer for sponges. Another corner was occupied by the\r\numpire, a foul-mouthed, loud-tongued Tombs shyster, named Pete Bradley.\r\nA long-bodied, short-legged hoodlum, nick-named “Heenan,” armed with a\r\nclub, acted as ring keeper, and “belted” back, remorselessly, any of\r\nthe spectators who crowded over the line. Did he see a foot obtruding\r\nitself so much as an inch over the mark in the sand--and the pressure\r\nfrom the crowd behind was so great that it was difficult for the front\r\nfellows to keep off the line--his heavy club and a blasting curse would\r\nfall upon the offender simultaneously.\r\n\r\nEvery effort was made to have all things conform as nearly as possible\r\nto the recognized practices of the “London Prize Ring.”\r\n\r\nAt Bradley’s call of “Time!” the principals would rise from their\r\nseconds’ knees, advance briskly to the scratch across the center of the\r\nring, and spar away sharply for a little time, until one got in a blow\r\nthat sent the other to the ground, where he would lie until his second\r\npicked him up, carried him back, washed his face off, and gave him a\r\ndrink. He then rested until the next call of time.\r\n\r\nThis sort of performance went on for an hour or more, with the\r\nknockdowns and other casualities pretty evenly divided between the two.\r\nThen it became apparent that the Infant was getting more than he had\r\nstorage room for. His interest in the skillet was evidently abating,\r\nthe leering grin he wore upon his face during the early part of the\r\nengagement had disappeared long ago, as the successive “hot ones” which\r\nthe Chicken had succeeded in planting upon his mouth, put it out of his\r\npower to “smile and smile,” “e’en though he might still be a villain.”\r\nHe began coming up to the scratch as sluggishly as a hired man starting\r\nout for his day’s work, and finally he did not come up at all. A bunch\r\nof blood soaked rags was tossed into the air from his corner, and\r\nBradley declared the Chicken to be the victor, amid enthusiastic cheers\r\nfrom the crowd.\r\n\r\nWe voted the thing rather tame. In the whole hour and a-half there\r\nwas not so much savage fighting, not so much damage done, as a couple\r\nof earnest, but unscientific men, who have no time to waste, will\r\nfrequently crowd into an impromptu affair not exceeding five minutes in\r\nduration.\r\n\r\nOur next visit to the N’Yaarkers was on a different errand. The moment\r\nthey arrived in camp we began to be annoyed by their depredations.\r\nBlankets--the sole protection of men--would be snatched off as they\r\nslept at night. Articles of clothing and cooking utensils would go the\r\nsame way, and occasionally a man would be robbed in open daylight.\r\nAll these, it was believed, with good reason, were the work of the\r\nN’Yaarkers, and the stolen things were conveyed to their camp.\r\nOccasionally depredators would be caught and beaten, but they would\r\ngive a signal which would bring to their assistance the whole body of\r\nN’Yaarkers, and turn the tables on their assailants.\r\n\r\nWe had in our squad a little watchmaker named Dan Martin, of the Eighth\r\nNew York Infantry. Other boys let him take their watches to tinker up,\r\nso as to make a show of running, and be available for trading to the\r\nguards.\r\n\r\nOne day Martin was at the creek, when a N’Yaarker asked him to let\r\nhim look at a watch. Martin incautiously did so, when the N’Yaarker\r\nsnatched it and sped away to the camp of his crowd. Martin ran back to\r\nus and told his story. This was the last feather which was to break\r\nthe camel’s back of our patience. Peter Bates, of the Third Michigan,\r\nthe Sergeant of our squad, had considerable confidence in his muscular\r\nability. He flamed up into mighty wrath, and swore a sulphurous oath\r\nthat we would get that watch back, whereupon about two hundred of us\r\navowed our willingness to help reclaim it.\r\n\r\nEach of us providing ourselves with a club, we started on our errand.\r\nThe rest of the camp--about four thousand--gathered on the hillside to\r\nwatch us. We thought they might have sent us some assistance, as it\r\nwas about as much their fight as ours, but they did not, and we were\r\ntoo proud to ask it. The crossing of the swamp was quite difficult.\r\nOnly one could go over at a time, and he very slowly. The N’Yaarkers\r\nunderstood that trouble was pending, and they began mustering to\r\nreceive us. From the way they turned out it was evident that we should\r\nhave come over with three hundred instead of two hundred, but it was\r\ntoo late then to alter the program. As we came up a stalwart Irishman\r\nstepped out and asked us what we wanted.\r\n\r\nBates replied: “We have come over to get a watch that one of your\r\nfellows took from one of ours, and by --- we’re going to have it.”\r\n\r\nThe Irishman’s reply was equally explicit though not strictly logical\r\nin construction. Said he: “We havn’t got your watch, and be ye can’t\r\nhave it.”\r\n\r\nThis joined the issue just as fairly as if it had been done by all the\r\ndocumentary formula that passed between Turkey and Russia prior to\r\nthe late war. Bates and the Irishman then exchanged very derogatory\r\nopinions of each other, and began striking with their clubs. The rest\r\nof us took this as our cue, and each, selecting as small a N’Yaarker as\r\nwe could readily find, sailed in.\r\n\r\nThere is a very expressive bit of slang coming into general use in the\r\nWest, which speaks of a man “biting off more than he can chew.”\r\n\r\nThat is what we had done. We had taken a contract that we should have\r\ndivided, and sub-let the bigger half. Two minutes after the engagement\r\nbecame general there was no doubt that we would have been much better\r\noff if we had staid on our own side of the creek. The watch was a very\r\npoor one, anyhow. We thought we would just say good day to our N’Yaark\r\nfriends, and return home hastily. But they declined to be left so\r\nprecipitately. They wanted to stay with us awhile. It was lots of fun\r\nfor them, and for the four thousand yelling spectators on the opposite\r\nhill, who were greatly enjoying our discomfiture. There was hardly\r\nenough of the amusement to go clear around, however, and it all fell\r\nshort just before it reached us. We earnestly wished that some of the\r\nboys would come over and help us let go of the N’Yaarkers, but they\r\nwere enjoying the thing too much to interfere.\r\n\r\nWe were driven down the hill, pell-mell, with the N’Yaarkers pursuing\r\nhotly with yell and blow. At the swamp we tried to make a stand to\r\nsecure our passage across, but it was only partially successful. Very\r\nfew got back without some severe hurts, and many received blows that\r\ngreatly hastened their deaths.\r\n\r\nAfter this the N’Yaarkers became bolder in their robberies, and more\r\narrogant in their demeanor than ever, and we had the poor revenge upon\r\nthose who would not assist us, of seeing a reign of terror inaugurated\r\nover the whole camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nDIMINISHING RATIONS--A DEADLY COLD RAIN--HOVERING OVER PITCH PINE FIRES\r\n--INCREASE ON MORTALITY--A THEORY OF HEALTH.\r\n\r\nThe rations diminished perceptibly day by day. When we first entered\r\nwe each received something over a quart of tolerably good meal, a\r\nsweet potato, a piece of meat about the size of one’s two fingers, and\r\noccasionally a spoonful of salt. First the salt disappeared. Then the\r\nsweet potato took unto itself wings and flew away, never to return.\r\nAn attempt was ostensibly made to issue us cow-peas instead, and the\r\nfirst issue was only a quart to a detachment of two hundred and seventy\r\nmen. This has two-thirds of a pint to each squad of ninety, and made\r\nbut a few spoonfuls for each of the four messes in the squad. When it\r\ncame to dividing among the men, the beans had to be counted. Nobody\r\nreceived enough to pay for cooking, and we were at a loss what to do\r\nuntil somebody suggested that we play poker for them. This met general\r\nacceptance, and after that, as long as beans were drawn, a large\r\nportion of the day was spent in absorbing games of “bluff” and “draw,”\r\nat a bean “ante,” and no “limit.”\r\n\r\nAfter a number of hours’ diligent playing, some lucky or skillful\r\nplayer would be in possession of all the beans in a mess, a squad, and\r\nsometimes a detachment, and have enough for a good meal.\r\n\r\nNext the meal began to diminish in quantity and deteriorate in quality.\r\nIt became so exceedingly coarse that the common remark was that the\r\nnext step would be to bring us the corn in the shock, and feed it to\r\nus like stock. Then meat followed suit with the rest. The rations\r\ndecreased in size, and the number of days that we did not get any, kept\r\nconstantly increasing in proportion to the days that we did, until\r\neventually the meat bade us a final adieu, and joined the sweet potato\r\nin that undiscovered country from whose bourne no ration ever returned.\r\n\r\nThe fuel and building material in the stockade were speedily exhausted.\r\nThe later comers had nothing whatever to build shelter with.\r\n\r\nBut, after the Spring rains had fairly set in, it seemed that we had\r\nnot tasted misery until then. About the middle of March the windows of\r\nheaven opened, and it began a rain like that of the time of Noah. It\r\nwas tropical in quantity and persistency, and arctic in temperature.\r\nFor dreary hours that lengthened into weary days and nights, and these\r\nagain into never-ending weeks, the driving, drenching flood poured\r\ndown upon the sodden earth, searching the very marrow of the five\r\nthousand hapless men against whose chilled frames it beat with pitiless\r\nmonotony, and soaked the sand bank upon which we lay until it was like\r\na sponge filled with ice-water. It seems to me now that it must have\r\nbeen two or three weeks that the sun was wholly hidden behind the\r\ndripping clouds, not shining out once in all that time. The intervals\r\nwhen it did not rain were rare and short. An hour’s respite would be\r\nfollowed by a day of steady, regular pelting of the great rain drops.\r\n\r\nI find that the report of the Smithsonian Institute gives the average\r\nannual rainfall in the section around Andersonville, at fifty-six\r\ninches --nearly five feet--while that of foggy England is only\r\nthirty-two. Our experience would lead me to think that we got the five\r\nfeet all at once.\r\n\r\nWe first comers, who had huts, were measurably better off than the\r\nlater arrivals. It was much drier in our leaf-thatched tents, and we\r\nwere spared much of the annoyance that comes from the steady dash of\r\nrain against the body for hours.\r\n\r\nThe condition of those who had no tents was truly pitiable.\r\n\r\nThey sat or lay on the hill-side the live-long day and night, and took\r\nthe washing flow with such gloomy composure as they could muster.\r\n\r\nAll soldiers will agree with me that there is no campaigning hardship\r\ncomparable to a cold rain. One can brace up against the extremes of\r\nheat and cold, and mitigate their inclemency in various ways. But there\r\nis no escaping a long-continued, chilling rain. It seems to penetrate\r\nto the heart, and leach away the very vital force.\r\n\r\nThe only relief attainable was found in huddling over little fires kept\r\nalive by small groups with their slender stocks of wood. As this wood\r\nwas all pitch-pine, that burned with a very sooty flame, the effect\r\nupon the appearance of the hoverers was, startling. Face, neck and\r\nhands became covered with mixture of lampblack and turpentine, forming\r\na coating as thick as heavy brown paper, and absolutely irremovable by\r\nwater alone. The hair also became of midnight blackness, and gummed up\r\ninto elflocks of fantastic shape and effect. Any one of us could have\r\ngone on the negro minstrel stage, without changing a hair, and put to\r\nblush the most elaborate make-up of the grotesque burnt-cork artists.\r\n\r\nNo wood was issued to us. The only way of getting it was to stand\r\naround the gate for hours until a guard off duty could be coaxed or\r\nhired to accompany a small party to the woods, to bring back a load of\r\nsuch knots and limbs as could be picked up. Our chief persuaders to\r\nthe guards to do us this favor were rings, pencils, knives, combs, and\r\nsuch trifles as we might have in our pockets, and, more especially, the\r\nbrass buttons on our uniforms. Rebel soldiers, like Indians, negros\r\nand other imperfectly civilized people, were passionately fond of\r\nbright and gaudy things. A handful of brass buttons would catch every\r\none of them as swiftly and as surely as a piece of red flannel will a\r\ngudgeon. Our regular fee for an escort for three of us to the woods was\r\nsix over-coat or dress-coat buttons, or ten or twelve jacket buttons.\r\nAll in the mess contributed to this fund, and the fuel obtained was\r\ncarefully guarded and husbanded.\r\n\r\nThis manner of conducting the wood business is a fair sample of the\r\nmanagement, or rather the lack of it, of every other detail of prison\r\nadministration. All the hardships we suffered from lack of fuel and\r\nshelter could have been prevented without the slightest expense or\r\ntrouble to the Confederacy. Two hundred men allowed to go out on\r\nparole, and supplied with ages, would have brought in from the adjacent\r\nwoods, in a week’s time, enough material to make everybody comfortable\r\ntents, and to supply all the fuel needed.\r\n\r\nThe mortality caused by the storm was, of course, very great. The\r\nofficial report says the total number in the prison in March was four\r\nthousand six hundred and three, of whom two hundred and eighty-three\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nAmong the first to die was the one whom we expected to live longest.\r\nHe was by much the largest man in prison, and was called, because of\r\nthis, “BIG JOE.” He was a Sergeant in the Fifth Pennsylvania Cavalry,\r\nand seemed the picture of health. One morning the news ran through the\r\nprison that “Big Joe is dead,” and a visit to his squad showed his\r\nstiff, lifeless form, occupying as much ground as Goliath’s, after his\r\nencounter with David.\r\n\r\nHis early demise was an example of a general law, the workings of which\r\nfew in the army failed to notice. It was always the large and strong\r\nwho first succumbed to hardship. The stalwart, huge-limbed, toil-inured\r\nmen sank down earliest on the march, yielded soonest to malarial\r\ninfluences, and fell first under the combined effects of home-sickness,\r\nexposure and the privations of army life. The slender, withy boys,\r\nas supple and weak as cats, had apparently the nine lives of those\r\nanimals. There were few exceptions to this rule in the army--there were\r\nnone in Andersonville. I can recall few or no instances where a large,\r\nstrong, “hearty” man lived through a few months of imprisonment. The\r\nsurvivors were invariably youths, at the verge of manhood,--slender,\r\nquick, active, medium-statured fellows, of a cheerful temperament, in\r\nwhom one would have expected comparatively little powers of endurance.\r\n\r\nThe theory which I constructed for my own private use in accounting for\r\nthis phenomenon I offer with proper diffidence to others who may be in\r\nsearch of a hypothesis to explain facts that they have observed. It is\r\nthis:\r\n\r\na. The circulation of the blood maintains health, and consequently\r\nlife by carrying away from the various parts of the body the particles\r\nof worn-out and poisonous tissue, and replacing them with fresh,\r\nstructure-building material.\r\n\r\nb. The man is healthiest in whom this process goes on most freely and\r\ncontinuously.\r\n\r\nc. Men of considerable muscular power are disposed to be sluggish;\r\nthe exertion of great strength does not favor circulation. It rather\r\nretards it, and disturbs its equilibrium by congesting the blood in\r\nquantities in the sets of muscles called into action.\r\n\r\nd. In light, active men, on the other hand, the circulation goes on\r\nperfectly and evenly, because all the parts are put in motion, and kept\r\nso in such a manner as to promote the movement of the blood to every\r\nextremity. They do not strain one set of muscles by long continued\r\neffort, as a strong man does, but call one into play after another.\r\n\r\nThere is no compulsion on the reader to accept this speculation at any\r\nvaluation whatever. There is not even any charge for it. I will lay\r\ndown this simple axiom:\r\n\r\n               No strong man, is a healthy man\r\n\r\nfrom the athlete in the circus who lifts pieces of artillery and\r\ncatches cannon balls, to the exhibition swell in a country gymnasium.\r\nIf my theory is not a sufficient explanation of this, there is nothing\r\nto prevent the reader from building up one to suit him better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN ALABAMIANS AND GEORGIANS--DEATH OF “POLL PARROTT”\r\n--A GOOD JOKE UPON THE GUARD--A BRUTAL RASCAL.\r\n\r\nThere were two regiments guarding us--the Twenty-Sixth Alabama and the\r\nFifty-Fifth Georgia. Never were two regiments of the same army more\r\ndifferent. The Alabamians were the superiors of the Georgians in every\r\nway that one set of men could be superior to another. They were manly,\r\nsoldierly, and honorable, where the Georgians were treacherous and\r\nbrutal. We had nothing to complain of at the hands of the Alabamians;\r\nwe suffered from the Georgians everything that mean-spirited cruelty\r\ncould devise. The Georgians were always on the look-out for something\r\nthat they could torture into such apparent violation of orders, as\r\nwould justify them in shooting men down; the Alabamians never fired\r\nuntil they were satisfied that a deliberate offense was intended. I can\r\nrecall of my own seeing at least a dozen instances where men of the\r\nFifty-Fifth Georgia Killed prisoners under the pretense that they were\r\nacross the Dead Line, when the victims were a yard or more from the\r\nDead Line, and had not the remotest idea of going any nearer.\r\n\r\nThe only man I ever knew to be killed by one of the Twenty-Sixth\r\nAlabama was named Hubbard, from Chicago, Ills., and a member of the\r\nThirty-Eighth Illinois. He had lost one leg, and went hobbling about\r\nthe camp on crutches, chattering continually in a loud, discordant\r\nvoice, saying all manner of hateful and annoying things, wherever\r\nhe saw an opportunity. This and his beak-like nose gained for him\r\nthe name of “Poll Parrot.” His misfortune caused him to be tolerated\r\nwhere another man would have been suppressed. By-and-by he gave still\r\ngreater cause for offense by his obsequious attempts to curry favor\r\nwith Captain Wirz, who took him outside several times for purposes that\r\nwere not well explained. Finally, some hours after one of Poll Parrot’s\r\nvisits outside, a Rebel officer came in with a guard, and, proceeding\r\nwith suspicious directness to a tent which was the mouth of a large\r\ntunnel that a hundred men or more had been quietly pushing forward,\r\nbroke the tunnel in, and took the occupants of the tent outside for\r\npunishment. The question that demanded immediate solution then was:\r\n\r\n“Who is the traitor who has informed the Rebels?”\r\n\r\nSuspicion pointed very strongly to “Poll Parrot.” By the next morning\r\nthe evidence collected seemed to amount to a certainty, and a crowd\r\ncaught the Parrot with the intention of lynching him. He succeeded\r\nin breaking away from them and ran under the Dead Line, near where I\r\nwas sitting in, my tent. At first it looked as if he had done this\r\nto secure the protection of the guard. The latter--a Twenty-Sixth\r\nAlabamian --ordered him out. Poll Parrot rose up on his one leg, put\r\nhis back against the Dead Line, faced the guard, and said in his harsh,\r\ncackling voice:\r\n\r\n“No; I won’t go out. If I’ve lost the confidence of my comrades I want\r\nto die.”\r\n\r\nPart of the crowd were taken back by this move, and felt disposed\r\nto accept it as a demonstration of the Parrot’s innocence. The rest\r\nthought it was a piece of bravado, because of his belief that the\r\nRebels would not injure, him after he had served them. They renewed\r\ntheir yells, the guard again ordered the Parrot out, but the latter,\r\ntearing open his blouse, cackled out:\r\n\r\n“No, I won’t go; fire at me, guard. There’s my heart shoot me right\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\nThere was no help for it. The Rebel leveled his gun and fired. The\r\ncharge struck the Parrot’s lower jaw, and carried it completely away,\r\nleaving his tongue and the roof of his mouth exposed. As he was carried\r\nback to die, he wagged his tongue rigorously, in attempting to speak,\r\nbut it was of no use.\r\n\r\nThe guard set his gun down and buried his face in his hands. It was the\r\nonly time that I saw a sentinel show anything but exultation at killing\r\na Yankee.\r\n\r\nA ludicrous contrast to this took place a few nights later. The rains\r\nhad ceased, the weather had become warmer, and our spirits rising\r\nwith this increase in the comfort of our surroundings, a number of\r\nus were sitting around “Nosey”--a boy with a superb tenor voice--who\r\nwas singing patriotic songs. We were coming in strong on the chorus,\r\nin a way that spoke vastly more for our enthusiasm for the Union than\r\nour musical knowledge. “Nosey” sang the “Star Spangled Banner,” “The\r\nBattle Cry of Freedom,” “Brave Boys are They,” etc., capitally, and we\r\nthrew our whole lungs into the chorus. It was quite dark, and while\r\nour noise was going on the guards changed, new men coming on duty.\r\nSuddenly, bang! went the gun of the guard in the box about fifty feet\r\naway from us. We knew it was a Fifty-Fifth Georgian, and supposed that,\r\nirritated at our singing, he was trying to kill some of us for spite.\r\nAt the sound of the gun we jumped up and scattered. As no one gave\r\nthe usual agonized yell of a prisoner when shot, we supposed the ball\r\nhad not taken effect. We could hear the sentinel ramming down another\r\ncartridge, hear him “return rammer,” and cock his rifle. Again the gun\r\ncracked, and again there was no sound of anybody being hit. Again we\r\ncould hear the sentry churning down another cartridge. The drums began\r\nbeating the long roll in the camps, and officers could be heard turning\r\nthe men out. The thing was becoming exciting, and one of us sang out to\r\nthe guard:\r\n\r\n“S-a-y! What the are you shooting at, any how?”\r\n\r\n“I’m a shootin’ at that ---- ---- Yank thar by the Dead Line, and by\r\n--- if you’uns don’t take him in I’ll blow the whole head offn him.”\r\n\r\n“What Yank? Where’s any Yank?”\r\n\r\n“Why, thar--right thar--a-standin’ agin the Ded Line.”\r\n\r\n“Why, you Rebel fool, that’s a chunk of wood. You can’t get any\r\nfurlough for shooting that!”\r\n\r\nAt this there was a general roar from the rest of the camp, which the\r\nother guards took up, and as the Reserves came double-quicking up, and\r\nlearned the occasion of the alarm, they gave the rascal who had been so\r\nanxious to kill somebody a torrent of abuse for having disturbed them.\r\n\r\nA part of our crowd had been out after wood during the day, and secured\r\na piece of a log as large as two of them could carry, and bringing it\r\nin, stood it up near the Dead Line. When the guard mounted to his post\r\nhe was sure he saw a temerarious Yankee in front of him, and hastened\r\nto slay him.\r\n\r\nIt was an unusual good fortune that nobody was struck. It was very\r\nrare that the guards fired into the prison without hitting at least\r\none person. The Georgia Reserves, who formed our guards later in the\r\nseason, were armed with an old gun called a Queen Anne musket, altered\r\nto percussion. It carried a bullet as big as a large marble, and three\r\nor four buckshot. When fired into a group of men it was sure to bring\r\nseveral down.\r\n\r\nI was standing one day in the line at the gate, waiting for a chance to\r\ngo out after wood. A Fifty-Fifth Georgian was the gate guard, and he\r\ndrew a line in the sand with his bayonet which we should not cross. The\r\ncrowd behind pushed one man till he put his foot a few inches over the\r\nline, to save himself from falling; the guard sank a bayonet through\r\nthe foot as quick as a flash.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nA NEW LOT OF PRISONERS--THE BATTLE OF OOLUSTEE--MEN SACRIFICED TO\r\nA GENERAL’S INCOMPETENCY--A HOODLUM REINFORCEMENT--A QUEER CROWD\r\n--MISTREATMENT OF AN OFFICER OF A COLORED REGIMENT--KILLING THE\r\nSERGEANT OF A NEGRO SQUAD.\r\n\r\nSo far only old prisoners--those taken at Gettysburg, Chicamauga\r\nand Mine Run--had been brought in. The armies had been very quiet\r\nduring the Winter, preparing for the death grapple in the Spring.\r\nThere had been nothing done, save a few cavalry raids, such as our\r\nown, and Averill’s attempt to gain and break up the Rebel salt works\r\nat Wytheville, and Saltville. Consequently none but a few cavalry\r\nprisoners were added to the number already in the hands of the Rebels.\r\n\r\nThe first lot of new ones came in about the middle of March. There\r\nwere about seven hundred of them, who had been captured at the battle\r\nof Oolustee, Fla., on the 20th of February. About five hundred\r\nof them were white, and belonged to the Seventh Connecticut, the\r\nSeventh New Hampshire, Forty Seventh, Forty-Eighth and One Hundred\r\nand Fifteenth New York, and Sherman’s regular battery. The rest were\r\ncolored, and belonged to the Eighth United States, and Fifty-Fourth\r\nMassachusetts. The story they told of the battle was one which had\r\nmany shameful reiterations during the war. It was the story told\r\nwhenever Banks, Sturgis, Butler, or one of a host of similar smaller\r\nfailures were trusted with commands. It was a senseless waste of the\r\nlives of private soldiers, and the property of the United States by\r\npretentious blunderers, who, in some inscrutable manner, had attained\r\nto responsible commands. In this instance, a bungling Brigadier named\r\nSeymore had marched his forces across the State of Florida, to do he\r\nhardly knew what, and in the neighborhood of an enemy of whose numbers,\r\ndisposition, location, and intentions he was profoundly ignorant.\r\nThe Rebels, under General Finnegan, waited till he had strung his\r\ncommand along through swamps and cane brakes, scores of miles from his\r\nsupports, and then fell unexpectedly upon his advance. The regiment\r\nwas overpowered, and another regiment that hurried up to its support,\r\nsuffered the same fate. The balance of the regiments were sent in in\r\nthe same manner--each arriving on the field just after its predecessor\r\nhad been thoroughly whipped by the concentrated force of the Rebels.\r\nThe men fought gallantly, but the stupidity of a Commanding General is\r\na thing that the gods themselves strive against in vain. We suffered a\r\nhumiliating defeat, with a loss of two thousand men and a fine rifled\r\nbattery, which was brought to Andersonville and placed in position to\r\ncommand the prison.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the Seventh New Hampshire were an unwelcome addition\r\nto our numbers. They were N’Yaarkers--old time colleagues of those\r\nalready in with us--veteran bounty jumpers, that had been drawn to\r\nNew Hampshire by the size of the bounty offered there, and had been\r\nassigned to fill up the wasted ranks of the veteran Seventh regiment.\r\nThey had tried to desert as soon as they received their bounty, but\r\nthe Government clung to them literally with hooks of steel, sending\r\nmany of them to the regiment in irons. Thus foiled, they deserted to\r\nthe Rebels during the retreat from the battlefield. They were quite an\r\naccession to the force of our N’Yaarkers, and helped much to establish\r\nthe hoodlum reign which was shortly inaugurated over the whole prison.\r\n\r\nThe Forty-Eighth New Yorkers who came in were a set of chaps so odd\r\nin every way as to be a source of never-failing interest. The name of\r\ntheir regiment was ‘L’Enfants Perdu’ (the Lost Children), which we\r\nanglicized into “The Lost Ducks.” It was believed that every nation\r\nin Europe was represented in their ranks, and it used to be said\r\njocularly, that no two of them spoke the same language. As near as I\r\ncould find out they were all or nearly all South Europeans, Italians,\r\nSpaniards; Portuguese, Levantines, with a predominance of the French\r\nelement. They wore a little cap with an upturned brim, and a strap\r\nresting on the chin, a coat with funny little tales about two inches\r\nlong, and a brass chain across the breast; and for pantaloons they had\r\na sort of a petticoat reaching to the knees, and sewed together down\r\nthe middle. They were just as singular otherwise as in their looks,\r\nspeech and uniform. On one occasion the whole mob of us went over in\r\na mass to their squad to see them cook and eat a large water snake,\r\nwhich two of them had succeeded in capturing in the swamps, and carried\r\noff to their mess, jabbering in high glee over their treasure trove.\r\nAny of us were ready to eat a piece of dog, cat, horse or mule, if we\r\ncould get it, but, it was generally agreed, as Dawson, of my company\r\nexpressed it, that “Nobody but one of them darned queer Lost Ducks\r\nwould eat a varmint like a water snake.”\r\n\r\nMajor Albert Bogle, of the Eighth United States, (colored) had fallen\r\ninto the hands of the rebels by reason of a severe wound in the leg,\r\nwhich left him helpless upon the field at Oolustee. The Rebels treated\r\nhim with studied indignity. They utterly refused to recognize him as an\r\nofficer, or even as a man. Instead of being sent to Macon or Columbia,\r\nwhere the other officers were, he was sent to Andersonville, the same\r\nas an enlisted man. No care was given his wound, no surgeon would\r\nexamine it or dress it. He was thrown into a stock car, without a bed\r\nor blanket, and hauled over the rough, jolting road to Andersonville.\r\nOnce a Rebel officer rode up and fired several shots at him, as he lay\r\nhelpless on the car floor. Fortunately the Rebel’s marksmanship was as\r\nbad as his intentions, and none of the shots took effect. He was placed\r\nin a squad near me, and compelled to get up and hobble into line when\r\nthe rest were mustered for roll-call. No opportunity to insult, “the\r\nnigger officer,” was neglected, and the N’Yaarkers vied with the Rebels\r\nin heaping abuse upon him. He was a fine, intelligent young man, and\r\nbore it all with dignified self-possession, until after a lapse of some\r\nweeks the Rebels changed their policy and took him from the prison to\r\nsend to where the other officers were.\r\n\r\nThe negro soldiers were also treated as badly as possible. The wounded\r\nwere turned into the Stockade without having their hurts attended\r\nto. One stalwart, soldierly Sergeant had received a bullet which\r\nhad forced its way under the scalp for some distance, and partially\r\nimbedded itself in the skull, where it still remained. He suffered\r\nintense agony, and would pass the whole night walking up and down the\r\nstreet in front of our tent, moaning distressingly. The bullet could\r\nbe felt plainly with the fingers, and we were sure that it would not\r\nbe a minute’s work, with a sharp knife, to remove it and give the man\r\nrelief. But we could not prevail upon the Rebel Surgeons even to see\r\nthe man. Finally inflammation set in and he died.\r\n\r\nThe negros were made into a squad by themselves, and taken out every\r\nday to work around the prison. A white Sergeant was placed over them,\r\nwho was the object of the contumely of the guards and other Rebels. One\r\nday as he was standing near the gate, waiting his orders to come out,\r\nthe gate guard, without any provocation whatever, dropped his gun until\r\nthe muzzle rested against the Sergeant’s stomach, and fired, killing\r\nhim instantly.\r\n\r\nThe Sergeantcy was then offered to me, but as I had no accident policy,\r\nI was constrained to decline the honor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nAPRIL--LONGING TO GET OUT--THE DEATH RATE--THE PLAGUE OF LICE --THE\r\nSO-CALLED HOSPITAL.\r\n\r\nApril brought sunny skies and balmy weather. Existence became much\r\nmore tolerable. With freedom it would have been enjoyable, even had we\r\nbeen no better fed, clothed and sheltered. But imprisonment had never\r\nseemed so hard to bear--even in the first few weeks--as now. It was\r\neasier to submit to confinement to a limited area, when cold and rain\r\nwere aiding hunger to benumb the faculties and chill the energies than\r\nit was now, when Nature was rousing her slumbering forces to activity,\r\nand earth, and air and sky were filled with stimulus to man to imitate\r\nher example. The yearning to be up and doing something-to turn these\r\ngolden hours to good account for self and country--pressed into heart\r\nand brain as the vivifying sap pressed into tree-duct and plant cell,\r\nawaking all vegetation to energetic life.\r\n\r\nTo be compelled, at such a time, to lie around in vacuous idleness\r\n--to spend days that should be crowded full of action in a monotonous,\r\nobjectless routine of hunting lice, gathering at roll-call, and drawing\r\nand cooking our scanty rations, was torturing.\r\n\r\nBut to many of our number the aspirations for freedom were not, as\r\nwith us, the desire for a wider, manlier field of action, so much as\r\nan intense longing to get where care and comforts would arrest their\r\nswift progress to the shadowy hereafter. The cruel rains had sapped\r\naway their stamina, and they could not recover it with the meager and\r\ninnutritious diet of coarse meal, and an occasional scrap of salt meat.\r\nQuick consumption, bronchitis, pneumonia, low fever and diarrhea seized\r\nupon these ready victims for their ravages, and bore them off at the\r\nrate of nearly a score a day.\r\n\r\nIt now became a part of, the day’s regular routine to take a walk past\r\nthe gates in the morning, inspect and count the dead, and see if any\r\nfriends were among them. Clothes having by this time become a very\r\nimportant consideration with the prisoners, it was the custom of the\r\nmess in which a man died to remove from his person all garments that\r\nwere of any account, and so many bodies were carried out nearly naked.\r\nThe hands were crossed upon the breast, the big toes tied together with\r\na bit of string, and a slip of paper containing the man’s name, rank,\r\ncompany and regiment was pinned on the breast of his shirt.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the dead was indescribably ghastly. The unclosed eyes\r\nshone with a stony glitter--\r\n\r\n               An orphan’s curse would drag to hell\r\n               A spirit from on high:\r\n               But, O, more terrible than that,\r\n               Is the curse in a dead man’s eye.\r\n\r\nThe lips and nostrils were distorted with pain and hunger, the sallow,\r\ndirt-grimed skin drawn tensely over the facial bones, and the whole\r\nframed with the long, lank, matted hair and beard. Millions of lice\r\nswarmed over the wasted limbs and ridged ribs. These verminous pests\r\nhad become so numerous--owing to our lack of changes of clothing, and\r\nof facilities for boiling what we had--that the most a healthy man\r\ncould do was to keep the number feeding upon his person down to a\r\nreasonable limit--say a few tablespoonfuls. When a man became so sick\r\nas to be unable to help himself, the parasites speedily increased into\r\nmillions, or, to speak more comprehensively, into pints and quarts. It\r\ndid not even seem exaggeration when some one declared that he had seen\r\na dead man with more than a gallon of lice on him.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the irritation from the biting of these myriads\r\nmaterially the days of those who died.\r\n\r\nWhere a sick man had friends or comrades, of course part of their duty,\r\nin taking care of him, was to “louse” his clothing. One of the most\r\neffectual ways of doing this was to turn the garments wrong side out\r\nand hold the seams as close to the fire as possible, without burning\r\nthe cloth. In a short time the lice would swell up and burst open,\r\nlike pop-corn. This method was a favorite one for another reason than\r\nits efficacy: it gave one a keener sense of revenge upon his rascally\r\nlittle tormentors than he could get in any other way.\r\n\r\nAs the weather grew warmer and the number in the prison increased, the\r\nlice became more unendurable. They even filled the hot sand under our\r\nfeet, and voracious troops would climb up on one like streams of ants\r\nswarming up a tree. We began to have a full comprehension of the third\r\nplague with which the Lord visited the Egyptians:\r\n\r\n    And the Lord said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod,\r\n    and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice through all\r\n    the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n    And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and\r\n    smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man and in beast;\r\n    all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of\r\n    Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe total number of deaths in April, according to the official report,\r\nwas five hundred and seventy-six, or an average of over nineteen a day.\r\nThere was an average of five thousand prisoner’s in the pen during\r\nall but the last few days of the month, when the number was increased\r\nby the arrival of the captured garrison of Plymouth. This would make\r\nthe loss over eleven per cent., and so worse than decimation. At that\r\nrate we should all have died in about eight months. We could have gone\r\nthrough a sharp campaign lasting those thirty days and not lost so\r\ngreat a proportion of our forces. The British had about as many men as\r\nwere in the Stockade at the battle of New Orleans, yet their loss in\r\nkilled fell much short of the deaths in the pen in April.\r\n\r\nA makeshift of a hospital was established in the northeastern corner of\r\nthe Stockade. A portion of the ground was divided from the rest of the\r\nprison by a railing, a few tent flies were stretched, and in these the\r\nlong leaves of the pine were made into apologies for beds of about the\r\ngoodness of the straw on which a Northern farmer beds his stock. The\r\nsick taken there were no better off than if they had staid with their\r\ncomrades.\r\n\r\nWhat they needed to bring about their recovery was clean clothing,\r\nnutritious food, shelter and freedom from the tortures of the lice.\r\nThey obtained none of these. Save a few decoctions of roots, there were\r\nno medicines; the sick were fed the same coarse corn meal that brought\r\nabout the malignant dysentery from which they all suffered; they wore\r\nand slept in the same vermin-infested clothes, and there could be but\r\none result: the official records show that seventy-six per cent. of\r\nthose taken to the hospitals died there.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the hospital was specially unfortunate for my\r\nlittle squad. The ground required for it compelled a general reduction\r\nof the space we all occupied. We had to tear down our huts and move.\r\nBy this time the materials had become so dry that we could not rebuild\r\nwith them, as the pine tufts fell to pieces. This reduced the tent\r\nand bedding material of our party--now numbering five--to a cavalry\r\novercoat and a blanket. We scooped a hole a foot deep in the sand and\r\nstuck our tent-poles around it. By day we spread our blanket over the\r\npoles for a tent. At night we lay down upon the overcoat and covered\r\nourselves with the blanket. It required considerable stretching to make\r\nit go over five; the two out side fellows used to get very chilly, and\r\nsqueeze the three inside ones until they felt no thicker than a wafer.\r\nBut it had to do, and we took turns sleeping on the outside. In the\r\ncourse of a few weeks three of my chums died and left myself and B. B.\r\nAndrews (now Dr. Andrews, of Astoria, Ill.) sole heirs to and occupants\r\nof, the overcoat and blanket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nTHE “PLYMOUTH PILGRIMS”--SAD TRANSITION FROM COMFORTABLE BARRACKS\r\nTO ANDERSONVILLE--A CRAZED PENNSYLVANIAN--DEVELOPMENT OF THE BUTLER\r\nBUSINESS.\r\n\r\nWe awoke one morning, in the last part of April, to find about two\r\nthousand freshly arrived prisoners lying asleep in the main streets\r\nrunning from the gates. They were attired in stylish new uniforms, with\r\nfancy hats and shoes; the Sergeants and Corporals wore patent leather\r\nor silk chevrons, and each man had a large, well-filled knapsack, of\r\nthe kind new recruits usually carried on coming first to the front, and\r\nwhich the older soldiers spoke of humorously as “bureaus.” They were\r\nthe snuggest, nattiest lot of soldiers we had ever seen, outside of the\r\n“paper collar” fellows forming the headquarter guard of some General in\r\na large City. As one of my companions surveyed them, he said:\r\n\r\n“Hulloa! I’m blanked if the Johnnies haven’t caught a regiment of\r\nBrigadier Generals, somewhere.”\r\n\r\nBy-and-by the “fresh fish,” as all new arrivals were termed, began to\r\nwake up, and then we learned that they belonged to a brigade consisting\r\nof the Eighty-Fifth New York, One Hundred and First and One Hundred\r\nand Third Pennsylvania, Sixteenth Connecticut, Twenty-Fourth New York\r\nBattery, two companies of Massachusetts heavy artillery, and a company\r\nof the Twelfth New York Cavalry.\r\n\r\nThey had been garrisoning Plymouth, N. C., an important seaport on the\r\nRoanoke River. Three small gunboats assisted them in their duty. The\r\nRebels constructed a powerful iron clad called the “Albemarle,” at a\r\npoint further up the Roanoke, and on the afternoon of the 17th, with\r\nher and three brigades of infantry, made an attack upon the post. The\r\n“Albemarle” ran past the forts unharmed, sank one of the gunboats, and\r\ndrove the others away. She then turned her attention to the garrison,\r\nwhich she took in the rear, while the infantry attacked in front. Our\r\nmen held out until the 20th, when they capitulated. They were allowed\r\nto retain their personal effects, of all kinds, and, as is the case\r\nwith all men in garrison, these were considerable.\r\n\r\nThe One Hundred and First and One Hundred and Third Pennsylvania and\r\nEighty-Fifth New York had just “veteranized,” and received their first\r\ninstalment of veteran bounty. Had they not been attacked they would\r\nhave sailed for home in a day or two, on their veteran furlough, and\r\nthis accounted for their fine raiment. They were made up of boys\r\nfrom good New York and Pennsylvania families, and were, as a rule,\r\nintelligent and fairly educated.\r\n\r\nTheir horror at the appearance of their place of incarceration was\r\nbeyond expression. At one moment they could not comprehend that we\r\ndirty and haggard tatterdemalions had once been clean, self-respecting,\r\nwell-fed soldiers like themselves; at the next they would affirm that\r\nthey knew they could not stand it a month, in here we had then endured\r\nit from four to nine months. They took it, in every way, the hardest of\r\nany prisoners that came in, except some of the ‘Hundred-Days’ men, who\r\nwere brought in in August, from the Valley of Virginia. They had served\r\nnearly all their time in various garrisons along the seacoast--from\r\nFortress Monroe to Beaufort--where they had had comparatively little of\r\nthe actual hardships of soldiering in the field. They had nearly always\r\nhad comfortable quarters, an abundance of food, few hard marches or\r\nother severe service. Consequently they were not so well hardened for\r\nAndersonville as the majority who came in. In other respects they were\r\nbetter prepared, as they had an abundance of clothing, blankets and\r\ncooking utensils, and each man had some of his veteran bounty still in\r\npossession.\r\n\r\nIt was painful to see how rapidly many of them sank under the miseries\r\nof the situation. They gave up the moment the gates were closed upon\r\nthem, and began pining away. We older prisoners buoyed ourselves up\r\ncontinually with hopes of escape or exchange. We dug tunnels with the\r\npersistence of beavers, and we watched every possible opportunity to\r\nget outside the accursed walls of the pen. But we could not enlist the\r\ninterest of these discouraged ones in any of our schemes, or talk. They\r\nresigned themselves to Death, and waited despondingly till he came.\r\n\r\nA middle-aged One Hundred and First Pennsylvanian, who had taken up\r\nhis quarters near me, was an object of peculiar interest. Reasonably\r\nintelligent and fairly read, I presume that he was a respectable\r\nmechanic before entering the Army. He was evidently a very domestic\r\nman, whose whole happiness centered in his family.\r\n\r\nWhen he first came in he was thoroughly dazed by the greatness of his\r\nmisfortune. He would sit for hours with his face in his hands and\r\nhis elbows on his knees, gazing out upon the mass of men and huts,\r\nwith vacant, lack-luster eyes. We could not interest him in anything.\r\nWe tried to show him how to fix his blanket up to give him some\r\nshelter, but he went at the work in a disheartened way, and finally\r\nsmiled feebly and stopped. He had some letters from his family and a\r\nmelaineotype of a plain-faced woman--his wife--and her children, and\r\nspent much time in looking at them. At first he ate his rations when\r\nhe drew them, but finally began to reject, them. In a few days he was\r\ndelirious with hunger and homesick ness. He would sit on the sand for\r\nhours imagining that he was at his family table, dispensing his frugal\r\nhospitalities to his wife and children.\r\n\r\nMaking a motion, as if presenting a dish, he would say:\r\n\r\n“Janie, have another biscuit, do!”\r\n\r\nOr,\r\n\r\n“Eddie, son, won’t you have another piece of this nice steak?”\r\n\r\nOr,\r\n\r\n“Maggie, have some more potatos,” and so on, through a whole family of\r\nsix, or more. It was a relief to us when he died in about a month after\r\nhe came in.\r\n\r\nAs stated above, the Plymouth men brought in a large amount of\r\nmoney --variously estimated at from ten thousand to one hundred\r\nthousand dollars. The presence of this quantity of circulating medium\r\nimmediately started a lively commerce. All sorts of devices were\r\nresorted to by the other prisoners to get a little of this wealth.\r\nRude chuck-a-luck boards were constructed out of such material as was\r\nattainable, and put in operation. Dice and cards were brought out by\r\nthose skilled in such matters. As those of us already in the Stockade\r\noccupied all the ground, there was no disposition on the part of many\r\nto surrender a portion of their space without exacting a pecuniary\r\ncompensation. Messes having ground in a good location would frequently\r\ndemand and get ten dollars for permission for two or three to quarter\r\nwith them. Then there was a great demand for poles to stretch blankets\r\nover to make tents; the Rebels, with their usual stupid cruelty, would\r\nnot supply these, nor allow the prisoners to go out and get them\r\nthemselves. Many of the older prisoners had poles to spare which they\r\nwere saying up for fuel. They sold these to the Plymouth folks at the\r\nrate of ten dollars for three--enough to put up a blanket.\r\n\r\nThe most considerable trading was done through the gates. The Rebel\r\nguards were found quite as keen to barter as they had been in Richmond.\r\nThough the laws against their dealing in the money of the enemy were\r\nstill as stringent as ever, their thirst for greenbacks was not abated\r\none whit, and they were ready to sell anything they had for the\r\ncoveted currency. The rate of exchange was seven or eight dollars in\r\nConfederate money for one dollar in greenbacks. Wood, tobacco, meat,\r\nflour, beans, molasses, onions and a villainous kind of whisky made\r\nfrom sorghum, were the staple articles of trade. A whole race of little\r\ntraffickers in these articles sprang up, and finally Selden, the Rebel\r\nQuartermaster, established a sutler shop in the center of the North\r\nSide, which he put in charge of Ira Beverly, of the One Hundredth\r\nOhio, and Charlie Huckleby, of the Eighth Tennessee. It was a fine\r\nillustration of the development of the commercial instinct in some men.\r\nNo more unlikely place for making money could be imagined, yet starting\r\nin without a cent, they contrived to turn and twist and trade, until\r\nthey had transferred to their pockets a portion of the funds which were\r\nin some one else’s. The Rebels, of course, got nine out of every ten\r\ndollars there was in the prison, but these middle men contrived to have\r\na little of it stick to their fingers.\r\n\r\nIt was only the very few who were able to do this. Nine hundred and\r\nninety-nine out of every thousand were, like myself, either wholly\r\ndestitute of money and unable to get it from anybody else, or they paid\r\nout what money they had to the middlemen, in exorbitant prices for\r\narticles of food.\r\n\r\nThe N’Yaarkers had still another method for getting food, money,\r\nblankets and clothing. They formed little bands called “Raiders,”\r\nunder the leadership of a chief villain. One of these bands would\r\nselect as their victim a man who had good blankets, clothes, a watch,\r\nor greenbacks. Frequently he would be one of the little traders, with\r\na sack of beans, a piece of meat, or something of that kind. Pouncing\r\nupon him at night they would snatch away his possessions, knock down\r\nhis friends who came to his assistance, and scurry away into the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nLONGINGS FOR GOD’S COUNTRY--CONSIDERATIONS OF THE METHODS OF GETTING\r\nTHERE--EXCHANGE AND ESCAPE--DIGGING TUNNELS, AND THE DIFFICULTIES\r\nCONNECTED THEREWITH--PUNISHMENT OF A TRAITOR.\r\n\r\nTo our minds the world now contained but two grand divisions, as widely\r\ndifferent from each other as happiness and misery. The first--that\r\nportion over which our flag floated was usually spoken of as “God’s\r\nCountry;” the other--that under the baneful shadow of the banner of\r\nrebellion--was designated by the most opprobrious epithets at the\r\nspeaker’s command.\r\n\r\nTo get from the latter to the former was to attain, at one bound, the\r\nhighest good. Better to be a doorkeeper in the House of the Lord, under\r\nthe Stars and Stripes, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness, under\r\nthe hateful Southern Cross.\r\n\r\nTo take even the humblest and hardest of service in the field now would\r\nbe a delightsome change. We did not ask to go home--we would be content\r\nwith anything, so long as it was in that blest place “within our\r\nlines.” Only let us get back once, and there would be no more grumbling\r\nat rations or guard duty--we would willingly endure all the hardships\r\nand privations that soldier flesh is heir to.\r\n\r\nThere were two ways of getting back--escape and exchange. Exchange was\r\nlike the ever receding mirage of the desert, that lures the thirsty\r\ntraveler on over the parched sands, with illusions of refreshing\r\nsprings, only to leave his bones at last to whiten by the side of those\r\nof his unremembered predecessors. Every day there came something to\r\nbuild up the hopes that exchange was near at hand--every day brought\r\nsomething to extinguish the hopes of the preceding one. We took these\r\nvarying phases according to our several temperaments. The sanguine\r\nbuilt themselves up on the encouraging reports; the desponding sank\r\ndown and died under the discouraging ones.\r\n\r\nEscape was a perpetual allurement. To the actively inclined among us\r\nit seemed always possible, and daring, busy brains were indefatigable\r\nin concocting schemes for it. The only bit of Rebel brain work that I\r\never saw for which I did not feel contempt was the perfect precautions\r\ntaken to prevent our escape. This is shown by the fact that, although,\r\nfrom first to last, there were nearly fifty thousand prisoners in\r\nAndersonville, and three out of every five of these were ever on the\r\nalert to take French leave of their captors, only three hundred and\r\ntwenty-eight succeeded in getting so far away from Andersonville as to\r\nleave it to be presumed that they had reached our lines.\r\n\r\nThe first, and almost superhuman difficulty was to get outside the\r\nStockade. It was simply impossible to scale it. The guards were too\r\nclose together to allow an instant’s hope to the most sanguine, that\r\nhe could even pass the Dead Line without being shot by some one of\r\nthem. This same closeness prevented any hope of bribing them. To be\r\nsuccessful half those on post would have to be bribed, as every part of\r\nthe Stockade was clearly visible from every other part, and there was\r\nno night so dark as not to allow a plain view to a number of guards of\r\nthe dark figure outlined against the light colored logs of any Yankee\r\nwho should essay to clamber towards the top of the palisades.\r\n\r\nThe gates were so carefully guarded every time they were opened as to\r\npreclude hope of slipping out through theme. They were only unclosed\r\ntwice or thrice a day--once to admit, the men to call the roll, once\r\nto let them out again, once to let the wagons come in with rations,\r\nand once, perhaps, to admit, new prisoners. At all these times every\r\nprecaution was taken to prevent any one getting out surreptitiously.\r\n\r\nThis narrowed down the possibilities of passing the limits of the pen\r\nalive, to tunneling. This was also surrounded by almost insuperable\r\ndifficulties. First, it required not less than fifty feet of\r\nsubterranean excavation to get out, which was an enormous work with\r\nour limited means. Then the logs forming the Stockade were set in the\r\nground to a depth of five feet, and the tunnel had to go down beneath\r\nthem. They had an unpleasant habit of dropping down into the burrow\r\nunder them. It added much to the discouragements of tunneling to think\r\nof one of these massive timbers dropping upon a fellow as he worked his\r\nmole-like way under it, and either crushing him to death outright, or\r\npinning him there to die of suffocation or hunger.\r\n\r\nIn one instance, in a tunnel near me, but in which I was not\r\ninterested, the log slipped down after the digger had got out beyond\r\nit. He immediately began digging for the surface, for life, and was\r\nfortunately able to break through before he suffocated. He got his head\r\nabove the ground, and then fainted. The guard outside saw him, pulled\r\nhim out of the hole, and when he recovered sensibility hurried him back\r\ninto the Stockade.\r\n\r\nIn another tunnel, also near us, a broad-shouldered German, of the\r\nSecond Minnesota, went in to take his turn at digging. He was so much\r\nlarger than any of his predecessors that he stuck fast in a narrow\r\npart, and despite all the efforts of himself and comrades, it was\r\nfound impossible to move him one way or the other. The comrades were\r\nat last reduced to the humiliation of informing the Officer of the\r\nGuard of their tunnel and the condition of their friend, and of asking\r\nassistance to release him, which was given.\r\n\r\nThe great tunneling tool was the indispensable half-canteen. The\r\ninventive genius of our people, stimulated by the war, produced nothing\r\nfor the comfort and effectiveness of the soldier equal in usefulness\r\nto this humble and unrecognized utensil. It will be remembered that a\r\ncanteen was composed of two pieces of tin struck up into the shape of\r\nsaucers, and soldered together at the edges. After a soldier had been\r\nin the field a little while, and thrown away or lost the curious and\r\ncomplicated kitchen furniture he started out with, he found that by\r\nmelting the halves of his canteen apart, he had a vessel much handier\r\nin every way than any he had parted with. It could be used for anything\r\n--to make soup or coffee in, bake bread, brown coffee, stew vegetables,\r\netc., etc. A sufficient handle was made with a split stick. When the\r\ncooking was done, the handle was thrown away, and the half canteen\r\nslipped out of the road into the haversack. There seemed to be no end\r\nof the uses to which this ever-ready disk of blackened sheet iron could\r\nbe turned. Several instances are on record where infantry regiments,\r\nwith no other tools than this, covered themselves on the field with\r\nquite respectable rifle pits.\r\n\r\nThe starting point of a tunnel was always some tent close to the Dead\r\nLine, and sufficiently well closed to screen the operations from the\r\nsight of the guards near by. The party engaged in the work organized\r\nby giving every man a number to secure the proper apportionment of the\r\nlabor. Number One began digging with his half canteen. After he had\r\nworked until tired, he came out, and Number Two took his place, and so\r\non. The tunnel was simply a round, rat-like burrow, a little larger\r\nthan a man’s body. The digger lay on his stomach, dug ahead of him,\r\nthrew the dirt under him, and worked it back with his feet till the man\r\nbehind him, also lying on his stomach, could catch it and work it back\r\nto the next. As the tunnel lengthened the number of men behind each\r\nother in this way had to be increased, so that in a tunnel seventy-five\r\nfeet long there would be from eight to ten men lying one behind the\r\nother. When the dirt was pushed back to the mouth of the tunnel it was\r\ntaken up in improvised bags, made by tying up the bottoms of pantaloon\r\nlegs, carried to the Swamp, and emptied. The work in the tunnel was\r\nvery exhausting, and the digger had to be relieved every half-hour.\r\n\r\nThe greatest trouble was to carry the tunnel forward in a straight\r\nline. As nearly everybody dug most of the time with the right hand,\r\nthere was an almost irresistible tendency to make the course veer\r\nto the left. The first tunnel I was connected with was a ludicrous\r\nillustration of this. About twenty of us had devoted our nights for\r\nover a week to the prolongation of a burrow. We had not yet reached\r\nthe Stockade, which astonished us, as measurement with a string showed\r\nthat we had gone nearly twice the distance necessary for the purpose.\r\nThe thing was inexplicable, and we ceased operations to consider the\r\nmatter. The next day a man walking by a tent some little distance from\r\nthe one in which the hole began, was badly startled by the ground\r\ngiving way under his feet, and his sinking nearly to his waist in a\r\nhole. It was very singular, but after wondering over the matter for\r\nsome hours, there came a glimmer of suspicion that it might be, in some\r\nway, connected with the missing end of our tunnel. One of us started\r\nthrough on an exploring expedition, and confirmed the suspicions by\r\ncoming out where the man had broken through. Our tunnel was shaped like\r\na horse shoe, and the beginning and end were not fifteen feet apart.\r\nAfter that we practised digging with our left hand, and made certain\r\ncompensations for the tendency to the sinister side.\r\n\r\nAnother trouble connected with tunneling was the number of traitors and\r\nspies among us. There were many--principally among the N’Yaarker crowd\r\nwho were always zealous to betray a tunnel, in order to curry favor\r\nwith the Rebel officers. Then, again, the Rebels had numbers of their\r\nown men in the pen at night, as spies. It was hardly even necessary\r\nto dress these in our uniform, because a great many of our own men\r\ncame into the prison in Rebel clothes, having been compelled to trade\r\ngarments with their captors.\r\n\r\nOne day in May, quite an excitement was raised by the detection of one\r\nof these “tunnel traitors” in such a way as left no doubt of his guilt.\r\nAt first everybody was in favor of killing him, and they actually\r\nstarted to beat him to death. This was arrested by a proposition to\r\n“have Captain Jack tattoo him,” and the suggestion was immediately\r\nacted upon.\r\n\r\n“Captain Jack” was a sailor who had been with us in the Pemberton\r\nbuilding at Richmond. He was a very skilful tattoo artist, but, I am\r\nsure, could make the process nastier than any other that I ever saw\r\nattempt it. He chewed tobacco enormously. After pricking away for a few\r\nminutes at the design on the arm or some portion of the body, he would\r\ndeluge it with a flood of tobacco spit, which, he claimed, acted as\r\na kind of mordant. Piping this off with a filthy rag, he would study\r\nthe effect for an instant, and then go ahead with another series of\r\nprickings and tobacco juice drenchings.\r\n\r\nThe tunnel-traitor was taken to Captain Jack. That worthy decided to\r\nbrand him with a great “T,” the top part to extend across his forehead\r\nand the stem to run down his nose. Captain Jack got his tattooing kit\r\nready, and the fellow was thrown upon the ground and held there. The\r\nCaptain took his head between his legs, and began operations. After an\r\ninstant’s work with the needles, he opened his mouth, and filled the\r\nwretch’s face and eyes full of the disgusting saliva. The crowd round\r\nabout yelled with delight at this new process. For an hour, that was\r\ndoubtless an eternity to the rascal undergoing branding, Captain Jack\r\ncontinued his alternate pickings and drenchings. At the end of that\r\ntime the traitor’s face was disfigured with a hideous mark that he\r\nwould bear to his grave. We learned afterwards that he was not one of\r\nour men, but a Rebel spy. This added much to our satisfaction with the\r\nmanner of his treatment. He disappeared shortly after the operation was\r\nfinished, being, I suppose, taken outside. I hardly think Captain Jack\r\nwould be pleased to meet him again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE HOUNDS, AND THE DIFFICULTIES THEY PUT IN THE WAY OF ESCAPE --THE\r\nWHOLE SOUTH PATROLLED BY THEM.\r\n\r\nThose who succeeded, one way or another, in passing the Stockade\r\nlimits, found still more difficulties lying between them and freedom\r\nthan would discourage ordinarily resolute men. The first was to get\r\naway from the immediate vicinity of the prison. All around were Rebel\r\npatrols, pickets and guards, watching every avenue of egress. Several\r\npacks of hounds formed efficient coadjutors of these, and were more\r\ndreaded by possible “escapes,” than any other means at the command\r\nof our jailors. Guards and patrols could be evaded, or circumvented,\r\nbut the hounds could not. Nearly every man brought back from a futile\r\nattempt at escape told the same story: he had been able to escape\r\nthe human Rebels, but not their canine colleagues. Three of our\r\ndetachment--members of the Twentieth Indiana--had an experience of this\r\nkind that will serve to illustrate hundreds of others. They had been\r\ntaken outside to do some work upon the cook-house that was being built.\r\nA guard was sent with the three a little distance into the woods to\r\nget a piece of timber. The boys sauntered, along carelessly with the\r\nguard, and managed to get pretty near him. As soon as they were fairly\r\nout of sight of the rest, the strongest of them--Tom Williams--snatched\r\nthe Rebel’s gun away from him, and the other two springing upon him as\r\nswift as wild cats, throttled him, so that he could not give the alarm.\r\nStill keeping a hand on his throat, they led him off some distance,\r\nand tied him to a sapling with strings made by tearing up one of their\r\nblouses. He was also securely gagged, and the boys, bidding him a\r\nhasty, but not specially tender, farewell, struck out, as they fondly\r\nhoped, for freedom. It was not long until they were missed, and the\r\nparties sent in search found and released the guard, who gave all the\r\ninformation he possessed as to what had become of his charges. All the\r\npacks of hounds, the squads of cavalry, and the foot patrols were sent\r\nout to scour the adjacent country. The Yankees kept in the swamps and\r\ncreeks, and no trace of them was found that afternoon or evening. By\r\nthis time they were ten or fifteen miles away, and thought that they\r\ncould safely leave the creeks for better walking on the solid ground.\r\nThey had gone but a few miles, when the pack of hounds Captain Wirz was\r\nwith took their trail, and came after them in full cry. The boys tried\r\nto ran, but, exhausted as they were, they could make no headway. Two of\r\nthem were soon caught, but Tom Williams, who was so desperate that he\r\npreferred death to recapture, jumped into a mill-pond near by. When he\r\ncame up, it was in a lot of saw logs and drift wood that hid him from\r\nbeing seen from the shore. The dogs stopped at the shore, and bayed\r\nafter the disappearing prey. The Rebels with them, who had seen Tom\r\nspring in, came up and made a pretty thorough search for him. As they\r\ndid not think to probe around the drift wood this was unsuccessful, and\r\nthey came to the conclusion that Tom had been drowned. Wirz marched\r\nthe other two back and, for a wonder, did not punish them, probably\r\nbecause he was so rejoiced at his success in capturing them. He was\r\nbeaming with delight when he returned them to our squad, and said, with\r\na chuckle:\r\n\r\n“Brisoners, I pring you pack two of dem tam Yankees wat got away\r\nyesterday, unt I run de oder raskal into a mill-pont and trowntet him.”\r\n\r\nWhat was our astonishment, about three weeks later, to see Tom, fat\r\nand healthy, and dressed in a full suit of butternut, come stalking\r\ninto the pen. He had nearly reached the mountains, when a pack of\r\nhounds, patrolling for deserters or negros, took his trail, where he\r\nhad crossed the road from one field to another, and speedily ran him\r\ndown. He had been put in a little country jail, and well fed till an\r\nopportunity occurred to send him back. This patrolling for negros and\r\ndeserters was another of the great obstacles to a successful passage\r\nthrough the country. The rebels had put, every able-bodied white man in\r\nthe ranks, and were bending every energy to keep him there. The whole\r\ncountry was carefully policed by Provost Marshals to bring out those\r\nwho were shirking military duty, or had deserted their colors, and to\r\ncheck any movement by the negros. One could not go anywhere without\r\na pass, as every road was continually watched by men and hounds. It\r\nwas the policy of our men, when escaping, to avoid roads as much as\r\npossible by traveling through the woods and fields.\r\n\r\nFrom what I saw of the hounds, and what I could learn from others,\r\nI believe that each pack was made up of two bloodhounds and from\r\ntwenty-five to fifty other dogs. The bloodhounds were debased\r\ndescendants of the strong and fierce hounds imported from Cuba--many of\r\nthem by the United States Government--for hunting Indians, during the\r\nSeminole war. The other dogs were the mongrels that are found in such\r\nplentifulness about every Southern house--increasing, as a rule, in\r\nnumbers as the inhabitant of the house is lower down and poorer. They\r\nare like wolves, sneaking and cowardly when alone, fierce and bold when\r\nin packs. Each pack was managed by a well-armed man, who rode a mule;\r\nand carried, slung over his shoulders by a cord, a cow horn, scraped\r\nvery thin, with which he controlled the band by signals.\r\n\r\nWhat always puzzled me much was why the hounds took only Yankee trails,\r\nin the vicinity of the prison. There was about the Stockade from six\r\nthousand to ten thousand Rebels and negros, including guards, officers,\r\nservants, workmen, etc. These were, of course, continually in motion\r\nand must have daily made trails leading in every direction. It was the\r\ncustom of the Rebels to send a pack of hounds around the prison every\r\nmorning, to examine if any Yankees had escaped during the night. It was\r\nbelieved that they rarely failed to find a prisoner’s tracks, and still\r\nmore rarely ran off upon a Rebel’s. If those outside the Stockade had\r\nbeen confined to certain path and roads we could have understood this,\r\nbut, as I understand, they were not. It was part of the interest of the\r\nday, for us, to watch the packs go yelping around the pen searching\r\nfor tracks. We got information in this way whether any tunnel had been\r\nsuccessfully opened during the night.\r\n\r\nThe use of hounds furnished us a crushing reply to the ever recurring\r\nRebel question:\r\n\r\n“Why are you-uns puttin’ niggers in the field to fight we-uns for?”\r\n\r\nThe questioner was always silenced by the return interrogatory:\r\n\r\n“Is that as bad as running white men down with blood hounds?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nMAY--INFLUX OF NEW PRISONERS--DISPARITY IN NUMBERS BETWEEN THE EASTERN\r\nAND WESTERN ARMIES--TERRIBLE CROWDING--SLAUGHTER OF MEN AT THE CREEK.\r\n\r\nIn May the long gathering storm of war burst with angry violence all\r\nalong the line held by the contending armies. The campaign began\r\nwhich was to terminate eleven months later in the obliteration of the\r\nSouthern Confederacy. May 1, Sigel moved up the Shenandoah Valley\r\nwith thirty thousand men; May 3, Butler began his blundering movement\r\nagainst Petersburg; May 3, the Army of the Potomac left Culpeper, and\r\non the 5th began its deadly grapple with Lee, in the Wilderness; May 6,\r\nSherman moved from Chattanooga, and engaged Joe Johnston at Rocky Face\r\nRidge and Tunnel Hill.\r\n\r\nEach of these columns lost heavily in prisoners. It could not be\r\notherwise; it was a consequence of the aggressive movements. An army\r\nacting offensively usually suffers more from capture than one on the\r\ndefensive. Our armies were penetrating the enemy’s country in close\r\nproximity to a determined and vigilant foe. Every scout, every skirmish\r\nline, every picket, every foraging party ran the risk of falling into a\r\nRebel trap. This was in addition to the risk of capture in action.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the prisoners were taken from the Army of the Potomac. For\r\nthis there were two reasons: First, that there were many more men in\r\nthat Army than in any other; and second, that the entanglement in the\r\ndense thickets and shrubbery of the Wilderness enabled both sides to\r\ncapture great numbers of the other’s men. Grant lost in prisoners from\r\nMay 5 to May 31, seven thousand four hundred and fifty; he probably\r\ncaptured two-thirds of that number from the Johnnies.\r\n\r\nWirz’s headquarters were established in a large log house which had\r\nbeen built in the fort a little distant from the southeast corner of\r\nthe prison. Every day--and sometimes twice or thrice a day--we would\r\nsee great squads of prisoners marched up to these headquarters, where\r\nthey would be searched, their names entered upon the prison records,\r\nby clerks (detailed prisoners; few Rebels had the requisite clerical\r\nskill) and then be marched into the prison. As they entered, the Rebel\r\nguards would stand to arms. The infantry would be in line of battle,\r\nthe cavalry mounted, and the artillerymen standing by their guns, ready\r\nto open at the instant with grape and canister.\r\n\r\nThe disparity between the number coming in from the Army of the\r\nPotomac and Western armies was so great, that we Westerners began to\r\ntake some advantage of it. If we saw a squad of one hundred and fifty\r\nor thereabouts at the headquarters, we felt pretty certain they were\r\nfrom Sherman, and gathered to meet them, and learn the news from our\r\nfriends. If there were from five hundred to two thousand we knew they\r\nwere from the Army of the Potomac, and there were none of our comrades\r\namong them. There were three exceptions to this rule while we were in\r\nAndersonville. The first was in June, when the drunken and incompetent\r\nSturgis (now Colonel of the Seventh United States Cavalry) shamefully\r\nsacrificed a superb division at Guntown, Miss. The next was after Hood\r\nmade his desperate attack on Sherman, on the 22d of July, and the third\r\nwas when Stoneman was captured at Macon. At each of these times about\r\ntwo thousand prisoners were brought in.\r\n\r\nBy the end of May there were eighteen thousand four hundred and\r\nfifty-four prisoners in the Stockade. Before the reader dismisses this\r\nstatement from his mind let him reflect how great a number this is.\r\nIt is more active, able-bodied young men than there are in any of our\r\nleading Cities, save New York and Philadelphia. It is more than the\r\naverage population of an Ohio County. It is four times as many troops\r\nas Taylor won the victory of Buena Vista with, and about twice as many\r\nas Scott went into battle with at any time in his march to the City of\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nThese eighteen thousand four hundred and fifty-four men were cooped up\r\non less than thirteen acres of ground, making about fifteen hundred\r\nto the acre. No room could be given up for streets, or for the usual\r\narrangements of a camp, and most kinds of exercise were wholly\r\nprecluded. The men crowded together like pigs nesting in the woods on\r\ncold nights. The ground, despite all our efforts, became indescribably\r\nfilthy, and this condition grew rapidly worse as the season advanced\r\nand the sun’s rays gained fervency. As it is impossible to describe\r\nthis adequately, I must again ask the reader to assist with a few\r\ncomparisons. He has an idea of how much filth is produced, on an\r\nordinary City lot, in a week, by its occupation by a family say of six\r\npersons. Now let him imagine what would be the result if that lot,\r\ninstead of having upon it six persons, with every appliance for keeping\r\nthemselves clean, and for removing and concealing filth, was the home\r\nof one hundred and eight men, with none of these appliances.\r\n\r\nThat he may figure out these proportions for himself, I will repeat\r\nsome of the elements of the problem: We will say that an average City\r\nlot is thirty feet front by one hundred deep. This is more front than\r\nmost of them have, but we will be liberal. This gives us a surface of\r\nthree thousand square feet. An acre contains forty-three thousand five\r\nhundred and sixty square feet. Upon thirteen of these acres, we had\r\neighteen thousand four hundred and fifty-four men. After he has found\r\nthe number of square feet that each man had for sleeping apartment,\r\ndining room, kitchen, exercise grounds and outhouses, and decided that\r\nnobody could live for any length of time in such contracted space, I\r\nwill tell him that a few weeks later double that many men were crowded\r\nupon that space that over thirty-five thousand were packed upon those\r\ntwelve and a-half or thirteen acres.\r\n\r\nBut I will not anticipate. With the warm weather the condition of the\r\nswamp in the center of the prison became simply horrible. We hear so\r\nmuch now-a-days of blood poisoning from the effluvia of sinks and\r\nsewers, that reading it, I wonder how a man inside the Stockade, and\r\ninto whose nostrils came a breath of that noisomeness, escaped being\r\ncarried off by a malignant typhus. In the slimy ooze were billions of\r\nwhite maggots. They would crawl out by thousands on the warm sand, and,\r\nlying there a few minutes, sprout a wing or a pair of them. With these\r\nthey would essay a clumsy flight, ending by dropping down upon some\r\nexposed portion of a man’s body, and stinging him like a gad-fly. Still\r\nworse, they would drop into what he was cooking, and the utmost care\r\ncould not prevent a mess of food from being contaminated with them.\r\n\r\nAll the water that we had to use was that in the creek which flowed\r\nthrough this seething mass of corruption, and received its sewerage.\r\nHow pure the water was when it came into the Stockade was a question.\r\nWe always believed that it received the drainage from the camps of the\r\nguards, a half-a-mile away.\r\n\r\nA road was made across the swamp, along the Dead Line at the west side,\r\nwhere the creek entered the pen. Those getting water would go to this\r\nspot, and reach as far up the stream as possible, to get the water that\r\nwas least filthy. As they could reach nearly to the Dead Line this\r\nfurnished an excuse to such of the guards as were murderously inclined\r\nto fire upon them. I think I hazard nothing in saying that for weeks\r\nat least one man a day was killed at this place. The murders became\r\nmonotonous; there was a dreadful sameness to them. A gun would crack;\r\nlooking up we would see, still smoking, the muzzle of the musket of\r\none of the guards on either side of the creek. At the same instant\r\nwould rise a piercing shriek from the man struck, now floundering in\r\nthe creek in his death agony. Then thousands of throats would yell out\r\ncurses and denunciations, and--\r\n\r\n“O, give the Rebel ---- ---- ---- ---- a furlough!”\r\n\r\nIt was our belief that every guard who killed a Yankee was rewarded\r\nwith a thirty-day furlough. Mr. Frederick Holliger, now of Toledo,\r\nformerly a member of the Seventy-Second Ohio, and captured at Guntown,\r\ntells me, as his introduction to Andersonville life, that a few hours\r\nafter his entry he went to the brook to get a drink, reached out too\r\nfar, and was fired upon by the guard, who missed him, but killed\r\nanother man and wounded a second. The other prisoners standing near\r\nthen attacked him, and beat him nearly to death, for having drawn the\r\nfire of the guard.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more inexcusable than these murders. Whatever defense\r\nthere might be for firing on men who touched the Dead Line in other\r\nparts of the prison, there could be none here. The men had no intention\r\nof escaping; they had no designs upon the Stockade; they were not\r\nleading any party to assail it. They were in every instance killed in\r\nthe act of reaching out with their cups to dip up a little water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nSOME DISTINCTION BETWEEN SOLDIERLY DUTY AND MURDER--A PLOT TO ESCAPE\r\n--IT IS REVEALED AND FRUSTRATED.\r\n\r\nLet the reader understand that in any strictures I make I do not\r\ncomplain of the necessary hardships of war. I understood fully and\r\naccepted the conditions of a soldier’s career. My going into the\r\nfield uniformed and armed implied an intention, at least, of killing,\r\nwounding, or capturing, some of the enemy. There was consequently no\r\nground of complaint if I was, myself killed, wounded, or captured.\r\nIf I did not want to take these chances I ought to stay at home. In\r\nthe same way, I recognized the right of our captors or guards to take\r\nproper precautions to prevent our escape. I never questioned for an\r\ninstant the right of a guard to fire upon those attempting to escape,\r\nand to kill them. Had I been posted over prisoners I should have\r\nhad no compunction about shooting at those trying to get away, and\r\nconsequently I could not blame the Rebels for doing the same thing. It\r\nwas a matter of soldierly duty.\r\n\r\nBut not one of the men assassinated by the guards at Andersonville were\r\ntrying to escape, nor could they have got away if not arrested by a\r\nbullet. In a majority of instances there was not even a transgression\r\nof a prison rule, and when there was such a transgression it was a mere\r\nharmless inadvertence. The slaying of every man there was a foul crime.\r\n\r\nThe most of this was done by very young boys; some of it by old men.\r\nThe Twenty-Sixth Alabama and Fifty-Fifth Georgia, had guarded us since\r\nthe opening of the prison, but now they were ordered to the field, and\r\ntheir places filled by the Georgia “Reserves,” an organization of boys\r\nunder, and men over the military age. As General Grant aptly-phrased\r\nit, “They had robbed the cradle and the grave,” in forming these\r\nregiments. The boys, who had grown up from children since the war\r\nbegan, could not comprehend that a Yankee was a human being, or that it\r\nwas any more wrongful to shoot one than to kill a mad dog. Their young\r\nimaginations had been inflamed with stories of the total depravity of\r\nthe Unionists until they believed it was a meritorious thing to seize\r\nevery opportunity to exterminate them.\r\n\r\nEarly one morning I overheard a conversation between two of these\r\nyouthful guards:\r\n\r\n“Say, Bill, I heerd that you shot a Yank last night?”\r\n\r\n“Now, you just bet I did. God! you jest ought to’ve heerd him holler.”\r\n\r\nEvidently the juvenile murderer had no more conception that he had\r\ncommitted crime than if he had killed a rattlesnake.\r\n\r\nAmong those who came in about the last of the month were two thousand\r\nmen from Butler’s command, lost in the disastrous action of May 15,\r\nby which Butler was “bottled up” at Bermuda Hundreds. At that time\r\nthe Rebel hatred for Butler verged on insanity, and they vented this\r\nupon these men who were so luckless--in every sense--as to be in his\r\ncommand. Every pains was taken to mistreat them. Stripped of every\r\narticle of clothing, equipment, and cooking utensils--everything,\r\nexcept a shirt and a pair of pantaloons, they were turned bareheaded\r\nand barefooted into the prison, and the worst possible place in the pen\r\nhunted out to locate them upon. This was under the bank, at the edge of\r\nthe Swamp and at the eastern side of the prison, where the sinks were,\r\nand all filth from the upper part of the camp flowed down to them. The\r\nsand upon which they lay was dry and burning as that of a tropical\r\ndesert; they were without the slightest shelter of any kind, the maggot\r\nflies swarmed over them, and the stench was frightful. If one of them\r\nsurvived the germ theory of disease is a hallucination.\r\n\r\nThe increasing number of prisoners made it necessary for the Rebels to\r\nimprove their means of guarding and holding us in check. They threw\r\nup a line of rifle pits around the Stockade for the infantry guards.\r\nAt intervals along this were piles of hand grenades, which could be\r\nused with fearful effect in case of an outbreak. A strong star fort\r\nwas thrown up at a little distance from the southwest corner. Eleven\r\nfield pieces were mounted in this in such a way as to rake the Stockade\r\ndiagonally. A smaller fort, mounting five guns, was built at the\r\nnorthwest corner, and at the northeast and southeast corners were small\r\nlunettes, with a couple of howitzers each. Packed as we were we had\r\nreason to dread a single round from any of these works, which could not\r\nfail to produce fearful havoc.\r\n\r\nStill a plot was concocted for a break, and it seemed to the sanguine\r\nportions of us that it must prove successful. First a secret society\r\nwas organized, bound by the most stringent oaths that could be devised.\r\nThe members of this were divided into companies of fifty men each;\r\nunder officers regularly elected. The secrecy was assumed in order\r\nto shut out Rebel spies and the traitors from a knowledge of the\r\ncontemplated outbreak. A man named Baker--belonging, I think, to some\r\nNew York regiment--was the grand organizer of the scheme. We were\r\ncareful in each of our companies to admit none to membership except\r\nsuch as long acquaintance gave us entire confidence in.\r\n\r\nThe plan was to dig large tunnels to the Stockade at various places,\r\nand then hollow out the ground at the foot of the timbers, so that a\r\nhalf dozen or so could be pushed over with a little effort, and make\r\na gap ten or twelve feet wide. All these were to be thrown down at\r\na preconcerted signal, the companies were to rush out and seize the\r\neleven guns of the headquarters fort. The Plymouth Brigade was then\r\nto man these and turn them on the camp of the Reserves who, it was\r\nimagined, would drop their arms and take to their heels after receiving\r\na round or so of shell. We would gather what arms we could, and place\r\nthem in the hands of the most active and determined. This would give us\r\nfrown eight to ten thousand fairly armed, resolute men, with which we\r\nthought we could march to Appalachicola Bay, or to Sherman.\r\n\r\nWe worked energetically at our tunnels, which soon began to assume such\r\nshape as to give assurance that they would answer our expectations in\r\nopening the prison walls.\r\n\r\nThen came the usual blight to all such enterprises: a spy or a traitor\r\nrevealed everything to Wirz. One day a guard came in, seized Baker and\r\ntook him out. What was done with him I know not; we never heard of him\r\nafter he passed the inner gate.\r\n\r\nImmediately afterward all the Sergeants of detachments were summoned\r\noutside. There they met Wirz, who made a speech informing them that he\r\nknew all the details of the plot, and had made sufficient preparations\r\nto defeat it. The guard had been strongly reinforced, and disposed in\r\nsuch a manner as to protect the guns from capture. The Stockade had\r\nbeen secured to prevent its falling, even if undermined. He said, in\r\naddition, that Sherman had been badly defeated by Johnston, and driven\r\nback across the river, so that any hopes of co-operation by him would\r\nbe ill-founded.\r\n\r\nWhen the Sergeants returned, he caused the following notice to be\r\nposted on the gates:\r\n\r\n                                NOTICE.\r\n\r\n    Not wishing to shed the blood of hundreds, not connected with those\r\n    who concocted a mad plan to force the Stockade, and make in this way\r\n    their escape, I hereby warn the leaders and those who formed\r\n    themselves into a band to carry out this, that I am in possession of\r\n    all the facts, and have made my dispositions accordingly, so as to\r\n    frustrate it. No choice would be left me but to open with grape and\r\n    canister on the Stockade, and what effect this would have, in this\r\n    densely crowded place, need not be told.\r\n\r\n    May 25, 1864.\r\n                                            H. Wirz.\r\n\r\nThe next day a line of tall poles, bearing white flags, were put up at\r\nsome little distance from the Dead Line, and a notice was read to us\r\nat roll call that if, except at roll call, any gathering exceeding one\r\nhundred was observed, closer the Stockade than these poles, the guns\r\nwould open with grape and canister without warning.\r\n\r\nThe number of deaths in the Stockade in May was seven hundred and\r\neight, about as many as had been killed in Sherman’s army during the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nJUNE--POSSIBILITIES OF A MURDEROUS CANNONADE--WHAT WAS PROPOSED TO\r\nBE DONE IN THAT EVENT--A FALSE ALARM--DETERIORATION OF THE RATIONS\r\n--FEARFUL INCREASE OF MORTALITY.\r\n\r\nAfter Wirz’s threat of grape and canister upon the slightest\r\nprovocation, we lived in daily apprehension of some pretext being found\r\nfor opening the guns upon us for a general massacre. Bitter experience\r\nhad long since taught us that the Rebels rarely threatened in vain.\r\nWirz, especially, was much more likely to kill without warning, than\r\nto warn without killing. This was because of the essential weakness of\r\nhis nature. He knew no art of government, no method of discipline save\r\n“kill them!” His petty little mind’s scope reached no further. He could\r\nconceive of no other way of managing men than the punishment of every\r\noffense, or seeming offense, with death. Men who have any talent for\r\ngoverning find little occasion for the death penalty. The stronger they\r\nare in themselves--the more fitted for controlling others--the less\r\ntheir need of enforcing their authority by harsh measures.\r\n\r\nThere was a general expression of determination among the prisoners to\r\nanswer any cannonade with a desperate attempt to force the Stockade.\r\nIt was agreed that anything was better than dying like rats in a pit\r\nor wild animals in a battue. It was believed that if anything would\r\noccur which would rouse half those in the pen to make a headlong effort\r\nin concert, the palisade could be scaled, and the gates carried, and,\r\nthough it would be at a fearful loss of life, the majority of those\r\nmaking the attempt would get out. If the Rebels would discharge grape\r\nand canister, or throw a shell into the prison, it would lash everybody\r\nto such a pitch that they would see that the sole forlorn hope of\r\nsafety lay in wresting the arms away from our tormentors. The great\r\nelement in our favor was the shortness of the distance between us and\r\nthe cannon. We could hope to traverse this before the guns could be\r\nreloaded more than once.\r\n\r\nWhether it would have been possible to succeed I am unable to say.\r\nIt would have depended wholly upon the spirit and unanimity with\r\nwhich the effort was made. Had ten thousand rushed forward at once,\r\neach with a determination to do or die, I think it would have been\r\nsuccessful without a loss of a tenth of the number. But the insuperable\r\ntrouble--in our disorganized state--was want of concert of action. I am\r\nquite sure, however, that the attempt would have been made had the guns\r\nopened.\r\n\r\nOne day, while the agitation of this matter was feverish, I was cooking\r\nmy dinner--that is, boiling my pitiful little ration of unsalted meal,\r\nin my fruit can, with the aid of a handful of splinters that I had been\r\nable to pick up by a half day’s diligent search. Suddenly the long\r\nrifle in the headquarters fort rang out angrily. A fuse shell shrieked\r\nacross the prison--close to the tops of the logs, and burst in the\r\nwoods beyond. It was answered with a yell of defiance from ten thousand\r\nthroats.\r\n\r\nI sprang up-my heart in my mouth. The long dreaded time had arrived;\r\nthe Rebels had opened the massacre in which they must exterminate us,\r\nor we them.\r\n\r\nI looked across to the opposite bank, on which were standing twelve\r\nthousand men--erect, excited, defiant. I was sure that at the next shot\r\nthey would surge straight against the Stockade like a mighty human\r\nbillow, and then a carnage would begin the like of which modern times\r\nhad never seen.\r\n\r\nThe excitement and suspense were terrible. We waited for what seemed\r\nages for the next gun. It was not fired. Old Winder was merely showing\r\nthe prisoners how he could rally the guards to oppose an outbreak.\r\nThough the gun had a shell in it, it was merely a signal, and the\r\nguards came double-quicking up by regiments, going into position in the\r\nrifle pits and the hand-grenade piles.\r\n\r\nAs we realized what the whole affair meant, we relieved our surcharged\r\nfeelings with a few general yells of execration upon Rebels generally,\r\nand upon those around us particularly, and resumed our occupation of\r\ncooking rations, killing lice, and discussing the prospects of exchange\r\nand escape.\r\n\r\nThe rations, like everything else about us, had steadily grown worse. A\r\nbakery was built outside of the Stockade in May and our meal was baked\r\nthere into loaves about the size of brick. Each of us got a half of one\r\nof these for a day’s ration. This, and occasionally a small slice of\r\nsalt pork, was call that I received. I wish the reader would prepare\r\nhimself an object lesson as to how little life can be supported on for\r\nany length of time, by procuring a piece of corn bread the size of an\r\nordinary brickbat, and a thin slice of pork, and then imagine how he\r\nwould fare, with that as his sole daily ration, for long hungry weeks\r\nand months. Dio Lewis satisfied himself that he could sustain life on\r\nsixty cents, a week. I am sure that the food furnished us by the Rebels\r\nwould not, at present prices cost one-third that. They pretended to\r\ngive us one-third of pound of bacon and one and one-fourth pounds of\r\ncorn meal. A week’s rations then would be two and one-third pounds of\r\nbacon--worth ten cents, and eight and three-fourths pounds of meal,\r\nworth, say, ten cents more. As a matter of fact, I do not presume that\r\nat any time we got this full ration. It would surprise me to learn that\r\nwe averaged two-thirds of it.\r\n\r\nThe meal was ground very coarse and produced great irrition in the\r\nbowels. We used to have the most frightful cramps that men ever\r\nsuffered from. Those who were predisposed intestinal affections were\r\nspeedily carried off by incurable diarrhea and dysentery. Of the\r\ntwelve thousand and twelve men who died, four thousand died of chronic\r\ndiarrhea; eight hundred and seventeen died of acute diarrhea, and one\r\nthousand three hundred and eighty-four died of dysenteria, making total\r\nof six thousand two hundred and one victims to enteric disorders.\r\n\r\nLet the reader reflect a moment upon this number, till comprehends\r\nfully how many six thousand two hundred and men are, and how much\r\nforce, energy, training, and rich possibilities for the good of the\r\ncommunity and country died with those six thousand two hundred and\r\none young, active men. It may help his perception of the magnitude of\r\nthis number to remember that the total loss of the British, during the\r\nCrimean war, by death in all shapes, was four thousand five hundred and\r\nninety-five, or one thousand seven hundred and six less than the deaths\r\nin Andersonville from dysenteric diseases alone.\r\n\r\nThe loathsome maggot flies swarmed about the bakery, and dropped into\r\nthe trough where the dough was being mixed, so that it was rare to get\r\na ration of bread not contaminated with a few of them.\r\n\r\nIt was not long until the bakery became inadequate to supply bread\r\nfor all the prisoners. Then great iron kettles were set, and mush was\r\nissued to a number of detachments, instead of bread. There was not\r\nso much cleanliness and care in preparing this as a farmer shows in\r\ncooking food for stock. A deep wagon-bed would be shoveled full of\r\nthe smoking paste, which was then hailed inside and issued out to the\r\ndetachments, the latter receiving it on blankets, pieces of shelter\r\ntents, or, lacking even these, upon the bare sand.\r\n\r\nAs still more prisoners came in, neither bread nor mush could be\r\nfurnished them, and a part of the detachments received their rations\r\nin meal. Earnest solicitation at length resulted in having occasional\r\nscanty issues of wood to cook this with. My detachment was allowed to\r\nchoose which it would take--bread, mush or meal. It took the latter.\r\n\r\nCooking the meal was the topic of daily interest. There were three\r\nways of doing it: Bread, mush and “dumplings.” In the latter the\r\nmeal was dampened until it would hold together, and was rolled into\r\nlittle balls, the size of marbles, which were then boiled. The bread\r\nwas the most satisfactory and nourishing; the mush the bulkiest--it\r\nmade a bigger show, but did not stay with one so long. The dumplings\r\nheld an intermediate position--the water in which they were boiled\r\nbecoming a sort of a broth that helped to stay the stomach. We received\r\nno salt, as a rule. No one knows the intense longing for this, when\r\none goes without it for a while. When, after a privation of weeks we\r\nwould get a teaspoonful of salt apiece, it seemed as if every muscle\r\nin our bodies was invigorated. We traded buttons to the guards for\r\nred peppers, and made our mush, or bread, or dumplings, hot with the\r\nfiery-pods, in hopes that this would make up for the lack of salt, but\r\nit was a failure. One pinch of salt was worth all the pepper pods in\r\nthe Southern Confederacy. My little squad--now diminished by death from\r\nfive to three--cooked our rations together to economize wood and waste\r\nof meal, and quarreled among ourselves daily as to whether the joint\r\nstock should be converted into bread, mush or dumplings. The decision\r\ndepended upon the state of the stomach. If very hungry, we made mush;\r\nif less famished, dumplings; if disposed to weigh matters, bread.\r\n\r\nThis may seem a trifling matter, but it was far from it. We all\r\nremember the man who was very fond of white beans, but after having\r\nfifty or sixty meals of them in succession, began to find a suspicion\r\nof monotony in the provender. We had now six months of unvarying diet\r\nof corn meal and water, and even so slight a change as a variation in\r\nthe way of combining the two was an agreeable novelty.\r\n\r\nAt the end of June there were twenty-six thousand three hundred\r\nand sixty-seven prisoners in the Stockade, and one thousand two\r\nhundred--just forty per day--had died during the month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nDYING BY INCHES--SEITZ, THE SLOW, AND HIS DEATH--STIGGALL AND EMERSON\r\n--RAVAGES ON THE SCURVY.\r\n\r\nMay and June made sad havoc in the already thin ranks of our battalion.\r\nNearly a score died in my company--L--and the other companies suffered\r\nproportionately. Among the first to die of my company comrades, was\r\na genial little Corporal, “Billy” Phillips--who was a favorite with\r\nus all. Everything was done for him that kindness could suggest, but\r\nit was of little avail. Then “Bruno” Weeks--a young boy, the son of a\r\npreacher, who had run away from his home in Fulton County, Ohio, to\r\njoin us, succumbed to hardship and privation.\r\n\r\nThe next to go was good-natured, harmless Victor Seitz, a Detroit cigar\r\nmaker, a German, and one of the slowest of created mortals. How he ever\r\ncame to go into the cavalry was beyond the wildest surmises of his\r\ncomrades. Why his supernatural slowness and clumsiness did not result\r\nin his being killed at least once a day, while in the service, was even\r\nstill farther beyond the power of conjecture. No accident ever happened\r\nin the company that Seitz did not have some share in. Did a horse fall\r\non a slippery road, it was almost sure to be Seitz’s, and that imported\r\nson of the Fatherland was equally sure to be caught under him. Did\r\nsomebody tumble over a bank of a dark night, it was Seitz that we soon\r\nheard making his way back, swearing in deep German gutterals, with\r\nfrequent allusion to ‘tausend teuflin.’ Did a shanty blow down, we ran\r\nover and pulled Seitz out of the debris, when he would exclaim:\r\n\r\n“Zo! dot vos pretty vunny now, ain’t it?”\r\n\r\nAnd as he surveyed the scene of his trouble with true German phlegm,\r\nhe would fish a brier-wood pipe from the recesses of his pockets, fill\r\nit with tobacco, and go plodding off in a cloud of smoke in search of\r\nsome fresh way to narrowly escape destruction. He did not know enough\r\nabout horses to put a snaffle-bit in one’s mouth, and yet he would draw\r\nthe friskiest, most mettlesome animal in the corral, upon whose back he\r\nwas scarcely more at home than he would be upon a slack rope. It was\r\nno uncommon thing to see a horse break out of ranks, and go past the\r\nbattalion like the wind, with poor Seitz clinging to his mane like the\r\ntraditional grim Death to a deceased African. We then knew that Seitz\r\nhad thoughtlessly sunk the keen spurs he would persist in wearing; deep\r\ninto the flanks of his high-mettled animal.\r\n\r\nThese accidents became so much a matter-of-course that when anything\r\nunusual occurred in the company our first impulse was to go and help\r\nSeitz out.\r\n\r\nWhen the bugle sounded “boots and saddles,” the rest of us would pack\r\nup, mount, “count off by fours from the right,” and be ready to move\r\nout before the last notes of the call had fairly died away. Just then\r\nwe would notice an unsaddled horse still tied to the hitching place. It\r\nwas Seitz’s, and that worthy would be seen approaching, pipe in mouth,\r\nand bridle in hand, with calm, equable steps, as if any time before the\r\nexpiration of his enlistment would be soon enough to accomplish the\r\nsaddling of his steed. A chorus of impatient and derisive remarks would\r\ngo up from his impatient comrades:\r\n\r\n“For heaven’s sake, Seitz, hurry up!”\r\n\r\n“Seitz! you are like a cow’s tail--always behind!”\r\n\r\n“Seitz, you are slower than the second coming of the Savior!”\r\n\r\n“Christmas is a railroad train alongside of you, Seitz!”\r\n\r\n“If you ain’t on that horse in half a second, Seitz, we’ll go off and\r\nleave you, and the Johnnies will skin you alive!” etc., etc.\r\n\r\nNot a ripple of emotion would roll over Seitz’s placid features under\r\nthe sharpest of these objurgations. At last, losing all patience, two\r\nor three boys would dismount, run to Seitz’s horse, pack, saddle and\r\nbridle him, as if he were struck with a whirlwind. Then Seitz would\r\nmount, and we would move ’off.\r\n\r\nFor all this, we liked him. His good nature was boundless, and his\r\ndisposition to oblige equal to the severest test. He did not lack a\r\ngrain of his full share of the calm, steadfast courage of his race, and\r\nwould stay where he was put, though Erebus yawned and bade him fly.\r\nHe was very useful, despite his unfitness for many of the duties of a\r\ncavalryman. He was a good guard, and always ready to take charge of\r\nprisoners, or be sentry around wagons or a forage pile-duties that most\r\nof the boys cordially hated.\r\n\r\nBut he came into the last trouble at Andersonville. He stood up pretty\r\nwell under the hardships of Belle Isle, but lost his cheerfulness--his\r\nunrepining calmness--after a few weeks in the Stockade. One day we\r\nremembered that none of us had seen him for several days, and we\r\nstarted in search of him. We found him in a distant part of the camp,\r\nlying near the Dead Line. His long fair hair was matted together, his\r\nblue eyes had the flush of fever. Every part of his clothing was gray\r\nwith the lice that were hastening his death with their torments. He\r\nuttered the first complaint I ever heard him make, as I came up to him:\r\n\r\n“My Gott, M ----, dis is worse dun a dog’s det!”\r\n\r\nIn a few days we gave him all the funeral in our power; tied his big\r\ntoes together, folded his hands across his breast, pinned to his shirt\r\na slip of paper, upon which was written:\r\n\r\n               VICTOR E. SEITZ,\r\n          Co. L, Sixteenth Illinois Cavalry.\r\n\r\nAnd laid his body at the South Gate, beside some scores of others that\r\nwere awaiting the arrival of the six-mule wagon that hauled them to the\r\nPotter’s Field, which was to be their last resting-place.\r\n\r\nJohn Emerson and John Stiggall, of my company, were two Norwegian boys,\r\nand fine specimens of their race--intelligent, faithful, and always\r\nready for duty. They had an affection for each other that reminded\r\none of the stories told of the sworn attachment and the unfailing\r\ndevotion that were common between two Gothic warrior youths. Coming\r\ninto Andersonville some little time after the rest of us, they found\r\nall the desirable ground taken up, and they established their quarters\r\nat the base of the hill, near the Swamp. There they dug a little hole\r\nto lie in, and put in a layer of pine leaves. Between them they had an\r\novercoat and a blanket. At night they lay upon the coat and covered\r\nthemselves with the blanket. By day the blanket served as a tent. The\r\nhardships and annoyances that we endured made everybody else cross and\r\nirritable. At times it seemed impossible to say or listen to pleasant\r\nwords, and nobody was ever allowed to go any length of time spoiling\r\nfor a fight. He could usually be accommodated upon the spot to any\r\nextent he desired, by simply making his wishes known. Even the best of\r\nchums would have sharp quarrels and brisk fights, and this disposition\r\nincreased as disease made greater inroads upon them. I saw in one\r\ninstance two brothers-both of whom died the next day of scurvy--and\r\nwho were so helpless as to be unable to rise, pull themselves up on\r\ntheir knees by clenching the poles of their tents --in order to strike\r\neach other with clubs, and they kept striking until the bystanders\r\ninterfered and took their weapons away from them.\r\n\r\nBut Stiggall and Emerson never quarreled with each other. Their\r\ntenderness and affection were remarkable to witness. They began to\r\ngo the way that so many were going; diarrhea and scurvy set in; they\r\nwasted away till their muscles and tissues almost disappeared, leaving\r\nthe skin lying fiat upon the bones; but their principal solicitude was\r\nfor each other, and each seemed actually jealous of any person else\r\ndoing anything for the other. I met Emerson one day, with one leg drawn\r\nclear out of shape, and rendered almost useless by the scurvy. He was\r\nvery weak, but was hobbling down towards the Creek with a bucket made\r\nfrom a boot leg. I said:\r\n\r\n“Johnny, just give me your bucket. I’ll fill it for you, and bring it\r\nup to your tent.”\r\n\r\n“No; much obliged, M ----” he wheezed out; “my pardner wants a cool\r\ndrink, and I guess I’d better get it for him.”\r\n\r\nStiggall died in June. He was one of the first victims of scurvy,\r\nwhich, in the succeeding few weeks, carried off so many. All of us who\r\nhad read sea-stories had read much of this disease and its horrors, but\r\nwe had little conception of the dreadful reality. It usually manifested\r\nitself first in the mouth. The breath became unbearably fetid; the\r\ngums swelled until they protruded, livid and disgusting, beyond the\r\nlips. The teeth became so loose that they frequently fell out, and\r\nthe sufferer would pick them up and set them back in their sockets.\r\nIn attempting to bite the hard corn bread furnished by the bakery the\r\nteeth often stuck fast and were pulled out. The gums had a fashion\r\nof breaking away, in large chunks, which would be swallowed or spit\r\nout. All the time one was eating his mouth would be filled with blood,\r\nfragments of gums and loosened teeth.\r\n\r\nFrightful, malignant ulcers appeared in other parts of the body; the\r\never-present maggot flies laid eggs in these, and soon worms swarmed\r\ntherein. The sufferer looked and felt as if, though he yet lived and\r\nmoved, his body was anticipating the rotting it would undergo a little\r\nlater in the grave.\r\n\r\nThe last change was ushered in by the lower parts of the legs\r\nswelling. When this appeared, we considered the man doomed. We all\r\nhad scurvy, more or less, but as long as it kept out of our legs we\r\nwere hopeful. First, the ankle joints swelled, then the foot became\r\nuseless. The swelling increased until the knees became stiff, and the\r\nskin from these down was distended until it looked pale, colorless and\r\ntransparent as a tightly blown bladder. The leg was so much larger at\r\nthe bottom than at the thigh, that the sufferers used to make grim\r\njokes about being modeled like a churn, “with the biggest end down.”\r\nThe man then became utterly helpless and usually died in a short time.\r\n\r\nThe official report puts down the number of deaths from scurvy at\r\nthree thousand five hundred and seventy-four, but Dr. Jones, the Rebel\r\nsurgeon, reported to the Rebel Government his belief that nine-tenths\r\nof the great mortality of the prison was due, either directly or\r\nindirectly, to this cause.\r\n\r\nThe only effort made by the Rebel doctors to check its ravages was\r\noccasionally to give a handful of sumach berries to some particularly\r\nbad case.\r\n\r\nWhen Stiggall died we thought Emerson would certainly follow him in a\r\nday or two, but, to our surprise, he lingered along until August before\r\ndying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\n“OLE BOO,” AND “OLE SOL, THE HAYMAKER”--A FETID, BURNING\r\nDESERT--NOISOME WATER, AND THE EFFECTS OF DRINKING IT--STEALING SOFT\r\nSOAP.\r\n\r\nThe gradually lengthening Summer days were insufferably long and\r\nwearisome. Each was hotter, longer and more tedious than its\r\npredecessors. In my company was a none-too-bright fellow, named Dawson.\r\nDuring the chilly rains or the nipping, winds of our first days in\r\nprison, Dawson would, as he rose in, the morning, survey the forbidding\r\nskies with lack-luster eyes and remark, oracularly:\r\n\r\n“Well, Ole Boo gits us agin, to-day.”\r\n\r\nHe was so unvarying in this salutation to the morn that his designation\r\nof disagreeable weather as “Ole Boo” became generally adopted by us.\r\nWhen the hot weather came on, Dawson’s remark, upon rising and seeing\r\nexcellent prospects for a scorcher, changed to: “Well, Ole Sol, the\r\nHaymaker, is going to git in his work on us agin to-day.”\r\n\r\nAs long as he lived and was able to talk, this was Dawson’s invariable\r\nobservation at the break of day.\r\n\r\nHe was quite right. The Ole Haymaker would do some famous work before\r\nhe descended in the West, sending his level rays through the wide\r\ninterstices between the somber pines.\r\n\r\nBy nine o’clock in the morning his beams would begin to fairly singe\r\neverything in the crowded pen. The hot sand would glow as one sees it\r\nin the center of the unshaded highway some scorching noon in August.\r\nThe high walls of the prison prevented the circulation inside of any\r\nbreeze that might be in motion, while the foul stench rising from the\r\nputrid Swamp and the rotting ground seemed to reach the skies.\r\n\r\nOne can readily comprehend the horrors of death on the burning sands\r\nof a desert. But the desert sand is at least clean; there is nothing\r\nworse about it than heat and intense dryness. It is not, as that was\r\nat Andersonville, poisoned with the excretions of thousands of sick\r\nand dying men, filled with disgusting vermin, and loading the air with\r\nthe germs of death. The difference is as that between a brick-kiln and\r\na sewer. Should the fates ever decide that I shall be flung out upon\r\nsands to perish, I beg that the hottest place in the Sahara may be\r\nselected, rather than such a spot as the interior of the Andersonville\r\nStockade.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that we had an abundance of water, which made a decided\r\nimprovement on a desert. Doubtless--had that water been pure. But\r\nevery mouthful of it was a blood poison, and helped promote disease\r\nand death. Even before reaching the Stockade it was so polluted by\r\nthe drainage of the Rebel camps as to be utterly unfit for human\r\nuse. In our part of the prison we sank several wells--some as deep\r\nas forty feet--to procure water. We had no other tools for this than\r\nour ever-faithful half canteens, and nothing wherewith to wall the\r\nwells. But a firm clay was reached a few feet below the surface, which\r\nafforded tolerable strong sides for the lower part, ana furnished\r\nmaterial to make adobe bricks for curbs to keep out the sand of the\r\nupper part. The sides were continually giving away, however, and\r\nfellows were perpetually falling down the holes, to the great damage of\r\ntheir legs and arms. The water, which was drawn up in little cans, or\r\nboot leg buckets, by strings made of strips of cloth, was much better\r\nthan that of the creek, but was still far from pure, as it contained\r\nthe seepage from the filthy ground.\r\n\r\nThe intense heat led men to drink great quantities of water, and this\r\nsuperinduced malignant dropsical complaints, which, next to diarrhea,\r\nscurvy and gangrene, were the ailments most active in carrying men off.\r\nThose affected in this way swelled up frightfully from day to day.\r\nTheir clothes speedily became too small for them, and were ripped off,\r\nleaving them entirely naked, and they suffered intensely until death\r\nat last came to their relief. Among those of my squad who died in this\r\nway, was a young man named Baxter, of the Fifth Indiana Cavalry, taken\r\nat Chicamauga. He was very fine looking--tall, slender, with regular\r\nfeatures and intensely black hair and eyes; he sang nicely, and was\r\ngenerally liked. A more pitiable object than he, when last I saw him,\r\njust before his death, can not be imagined. His body had swollen until\r\nit seemed marvelous that the human skin could bear so much distention\r\nwithout disruption, All the old look of bright intelligence had been.\r\ndriven from his face by the distortion of his features. His swarthy\r\nhair and beard, grown long and ragged, had that peculiar repulsive look\r\nwhich the black hair of the sick is prone to assume.\r\n\r\nI attributed much of my freedom from the diseases to which others\r\nsuccumbed to abstention from water drinking. Long before I entered the\r\narmy, I had constructed a theory--on premises that were doubtless as\r\ninsufficient as those that boyish theories are usually based upon--that\r\ndrinking water was a habit, and a pernicious one, which sapped away\r\nthe energy. I took some trouble to curb my appetite for water, and\r\nsoon found that I got along very comfortably without drinking anything\r\nbeyond that which was contained in my food. I followed this up after\r\nentering the army, drinking nothing at any time but a little coffee,\r\nand finding no need, even on the dustiest marches, for anything more. I\r\ndo not presume that in a year I drank a quart of cold water. Experience\r\nseemed to confirm my views, for I noticed that the first to sink under\r\na fatigue, or to yield to sickness, were those who were always on the\r\nlookout for drinking water, springing from their horses and struggling\r\naround every well or spring on the line of march for an opportunity to\r\nfill their canteens.\r\n\r\nI made liberal use of the Creek for bathing purposes, however, visiting\r\nit four or five times a day during the hot days, to wash myself all\r\nover. This did not cool one off much, for the shallow stream was nearly\r\nas hot as the sand, but it seemed to do some good, and it helped pass\r\naway the tedious hours. The stream was nearly all the time filled as\r\nfull of bathers as they could stand, and the water could do little\r\ntowards cleansing so many. The occasional rain storms that swept\r\nacross the prison were welcomed, not only because they cooled the air\r\ntemporarily, but because they gave us a shower-bath. As they came up,\r\nnearly every one stripped naked and got out where he could enjoy the\r\nfull benefit of the falling water. Fancy, if possible, the spectacle\r\nof twenty-five thousand or thirty thousand men without a stitch of\r\nclothing upon them. The like has not been seen, I imagine, since the\r\nnaked followers of Boadicea gathered in force to do battle to the Roman\r\ninvaders.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to get really clean. Our bodies seemed covered with\r\na varnish-like, gummy matter that defied removal by water alone. I\r\nimagined that it came from the rosin or turpentine, arising from the\r\nlittle pitch pine fires over which we hovered when cooking our rations.\r\nIt would yield to nothing except strong soap-and soap, as I have before\r\nstated--was nearly as scarce in the Southern Confederacy as salt. We in\r\nprison saw even less of it, or rather, none at all. The scarcity of it,\r\nand our desire for it, recalls a bit of personal experience.\r\n\r\nI had steadfastly refused all offers of positions outside the prison\r\non parole, as, like the great majority of the prisoners, my hatred of\r\nthe Rebels grew more bitter, day by day; I felt as if I would rather\r\ndie than accept the smallest favor at their hands, and I shared the\r\ncommon contempt for those who did. But, when the movement for a grand\r\nattack on the Stockade--mentioned in a previous chapter--was apparently\r\nrapidly coming to a head, I was offered a temporary detail outside to,\r\nassist in making up some rolls. I resolved to accept; first because\r\nI thought I might get some information that would be of use in our\r\nenterprise; and, next, because I foresaw that the rush through the gaps\r\nin the Stockade would be bloody business, and by going out in advance\r\nI would avoid that much of the danger, and still be able to give\r\neffective assistance.\r\n\r\nI was taken up to Wirz’s office. He was writing at a desk at one end of\r\na large room when the Sergeant brought me in. He turned around, told\r\nthe Sergeant to leave me, and ordered me to sit down upon a box at the\r\nother end of the room.\r\n\r\nTurning his back and resuming his writing, in a few minutes he had\r\nforgotten me. I sat quietly, taking in the details for a half-hour, and\r\nthen, having exhausted everything else in the room, I began wondering\r\nwhat was in the box I was sitting upon. The lid was loose; I hitched\r\nit forward a little without attracting Wirz’s attention, and slipped\r\nmy left hand down of a voyage of discovery. It seemed very likely that\r\nthere was something there that a loyal Yankee deserved better than a\r\nRebel. I found that it was a fine article of soft soap. A handful was\r\nscooped up and speedily shoved into my left pantaloon pocket. Expecting\r\nevery instant that Wirz would turn around and order me to come to the\r\ndesk to show my handwriting, hastily and furtively wiped my hand on the\r\nback of my shirt and watched Wirz with as innocent an expression as a\r\nschool boy assumes when he has just flipped a chewed paper wad across\r\nthe room. Wirz was still engrossed in his writing, and did not look\r\naround. I was emboldened to reach down for another handful. This was\r\nalso successfully transferred, the hand wiped off on the back of the\r\nshirt, and the face wore its expression of infantile ingenuousness.\r\nStill Wirz did not look up. I kept dipping up handful after handful,\r\nuntil I had gotten about a quart in the left hand pocket. After each\r\nhandful I rubbed my hand off on the back of my shirt and waited an\r\ninstant for a summons to the desk. Then the process was repeated with\r\nthe other hand, and a quart of the saponaceous mush was packed in the\r\nright hand pocket.\r\n\r\nShortly after Wirz rose and ordered a guard to take me away and keep\r\nme, until he decided what to do with me. The day was intensely hot, and\r\nsoon the soap in my pockets and on the back of my shirt began burning\r\nlike double strength Spanish fly blisters. There was nothing to do but\r\ngrin and bear it. I set my teeth, squatted down under the shade of the\r\nparapet of the fort, and stood it silently and sullenly. For the first\r\ntime in my life I thoroughly appreciated the story of the Spartan boy,\r\nwho stole the fox and suffered the animal to tear his bowels out rather\r\nthan give a sign which would lead to the exposure of his theft.\r\n\r\nBetween four and five o’clock-after I had endured the thing for five or\r\nsix hours, a guard came with orders from Wirz that I should be returned\r\nto the Stockade. Upon hastily removing my clothes, after coming inside,\r\nI found I had a blister on each thigh, and one down my back, that would\r\nhave delighted an old practitioner of the heroic school. But I also had\r\na half gallon of excellent soft soap. My chums and I took a magnificent\r\nwash, and gave our clothes the same, and we still had soap enough left\r\nto barter for some onions that we had long coveted, and which tasted as\r\nsweet to us as manna to the Israelites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\n“POUR PASSER LE TEMPS”--A SET OF CHESSMEN PROCURED UNDER DIFFICULTIES\r\n--RELIGIOUS SERVICES--THE DEVOTED PRIEST--WAR SONG.\r\n\r\nThe time moved with leaden feet. Do the best we could, there were very\r\nmany tiresome hours for which no occupation whatever could be found.\r\nAll that was necessary to be done during the day--attending roll\r\ncall, drawing and cooking rations, killing lice and washing--could be\r\ndisposed of in an hour’s time, and we were left with fifteen or sixteen\r\nwaking hours, for which there was absolutely no employment. Very many\r\ntried to escape both the heat and ennui by sleeping as much as possible\r\nthrough the day, but I noticed that those who did this soon died, and\r\nconsequently I did not do it. Card playing had sufficed to pass away\r\nthe hours at first, but our cards soon wore out, and deprived us of\r\nthis resource. My chum, Andrews, and I constructed a set of chessmen\r\nwith an infinite deal of trouble. We found a soft, white root in the\r\nswamp which answered our purpose. A boy near us had a tolerably sharp\r\npocket-knife, for the use of which a couple of hours each day, we gave\r\na few spoonfuls of meal. The knife was the only one among a large\r\nnumber of prisoners, as the Rebel guards had an affection for that\r\nstyle of cutlery, which led them to search incoming prisoners, very\r\nclosely. The fortunate owner of this derived quite a little income of\r\nmeal by shrewdly loaning it to his knifeless comrades. The shapes that\r\nwe made for pieces and pawns were necessarily very rude, but they were\r\nsufficiently distinct for identification. We blackened one set with\r\npitch pine soot, found a piece of plank that would answer for a board\r\nand purchased it from its possessor for part of a ration of meal, and\r\nso were fitted out with what served until our release to distract our\r\nattention from much of the surrounding misery.\r\n\r\nEvery one else procured such amusement as they could. Newcomers, who\r\nstill had money and cards, gambled as long as their means lasted. Those\r\nwho had books read them until the leaves fell apart. Those who had\r\npaper and pen and ink tried to write descriptions and keep journals,\r\nbut this was usually given up after being in prison a few weeks. I\r\nwas fortunate enough to know a boy who had brought a copy of “Gray’s\r\nAnatomy” into prison with him. I was not specially interested in the\r\nsubject, but it was Hobson’s choice; I could read anatomy or nothing,\r\nand so I tackled it with such good will that before my friend became\r\nsick and was taken outside, and his book with him, I had obtained a\r\nvery fair knowledge of the rudiments of physiology.\r\n\r\nThere was a little band of devoted Christian workers, among whom were\r\nOrderly Sergeant Thomas J. Sheppard, Ninety-Seventh O. Y. L, now a\r\nleading Baptist minister in Eastern Ohio; Boston Corbett, who afterward\r\nslew John Wilkes Booth, and Frank Smith, now at the head of the\r\nRailroad Bethel work at Toledo. They were indefatigable in trying to\r\nevangelize the prison. A few of them would take their station in some\r\npart of the Stockade (a different one every time), and begin singing\r\nsome old familiar hymn like:\r\n\r\n               “Come, Thou fount of every blessing,”\r\n\r\nand in a few minutes they would have an attentive audience of as many\r\nthousand as could get within hearing. The singing would be followed\r\nby regular services, during which Sheppard, Smith, Corbett, and some\r\nothers would make short, spirited, practical addresses, which no doubt\r\ndid much good to all who heard them, though the grains of leaven were\r\nentirely too small to leaven such an immense measure of meal. They\r\nconducted several funerals, as nearly like the way it was done at home\r\nas possible. Their ministrations were not confined to mere lip service,\r\nbut they labored assiduously in caring for the sick, and made many a\r\npoor fellow’s way to the grave much smoother for him.\r\n\r\nThis was about all the religious services that we were favored with.\r\nThe Rebel preachers did not make that effort to save our misguided\r\nsouls which one would have imagined they would having us where we could\r\nnot choose but hear they might have taken advantage of our situation\r\nto rake us fore and aft with their theological artillery. They only\r\nattempted it in one instance. While in Richmond a preacher came into\r\nour room and announced in an authoritative way that he would address us\r\non religious subjects. We uncovered respectfully, and gathered around\r\nhim. He was a loud-tongued, brawling Boanerges, who addressed the Lord\r\nas if drilling a brigade.\r\n\r\nHe spoke but a few moments before making apparent his belief that the\r\nworst of crimes was that of being a Yankee, and that a man must not\r\nonly be saved through Christ’s blood, but also serve in the Rebel army\r\nbefore he could attain to heaven.\r\n\r\nOf course we raised such a yell of derision that the sermon was brought\r\nto an abrupt conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe only minister who came into the Stockade was a Catholic priest,\r\nmiddle-aged, tall, slender, and unmistakably devout. He was unwearied\r\nin his attention to the sick, and the whole day could be seen moving\r\naround through the prison, attending to those who needed spiritual\r\nconsolation. It was interesting to see him administer the extreme\r\nunction to a dying man. Placing a long purple scarf about his own\r\nneck and a small brazen crucifix in the hands of the dying one, he\r\nwould kneel by the latter’s side and anoint him upon the eyes, ears,\r\nnostrils; lips, hands, feet and breast, with sacred oil; from a little\r\nbrass vessel, repeating the while, in an impressive voice, the solemn\r\noffices of the Church.\r\n\r\nHis unwearying devotion gained the admiration of all, no matter how\r\nlittle inclined one might be to view priestliness generally with favor.\r\nHe was evidently of such stuff as Christian heros have ever been made\r\nof, and would have faced stake and fagot, at the call of duty, with\r\nunquailing eye. His name was Father Hamilton, and he was stationed\r\nat Macon. The world should know more of a man whose services were so\r\ncreditable to humanity and his Church:\r\n\r\nThe good father had the wisdom of the serpent, with the harmlessness\r\nof the dove. Though full of commiseration for the unhappy lot of the\r\nprisoners, nothing could betray him into the slightest expression of\r\nopinion regarding the war or those who were the authors of all this\r\nmisery. In our impatience at our treatment, and hunger for news, we\r\nforgot his sacerdotal character, and importuned him for tidings of\r\nthe exchange. His invariable reply was that he lived apart from these\r\nthings and kept himself ignorant of them.\r\n\r\n“But, father,” said I one day, with an impatience that I could not\r\nwholly repress, “you must certainly hear or read something of this,\r\nwhile you are outside among the Rebel officers.” Like many other\r\npeople, I supposed that the whole world was excited over that in which\r\nI felt a deep interest.\r\n\r\n“No, my son,” replied he, in his usual calm, measured tones. “I go not\r\namong them, nor do I hear anything from them. When I leave the prison\r\nin the evening, full of sorrow at what I have seen here, I find that\r\nthe best use I can make of my time is in studying the Word of God, and\r\nespecially the Psalms of David.”\r\n\r\nWe were not any longer good company for each other. We had heard over\r\nand over again all each other’s stories and jokes, and each knew as\r\nmuch about the other’s previous history as we chose to communicate. The\r\nstory of every individual’s past life, relations, friends, regiment,\r\nand soldier experience had been told again and again, until the\r\nrepetition was wearisome. The cool nights following the hot days were\r\nfavorable to little gossiping seances like the yarn-spinning watches\r\nof sailors on pleasant nights. Our squad, though its stock of stories\r\nwas worn threadbare, was fortunate enough to have a sweet singer in\r\nIsrael “Nosey” Payne--of whose tunefulness we never tired. He had a\r\nlarge repertoire of patriotic songs, which he sang with feeling and\r\ncorrectness, and which helped much to make the calm Summer nights pass\r\nagreeably. Among the best of these was “Brave Boys are They,” which\r\nI always thought was the finest ballad, both in poetry and music,\r\nproduced by the War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nMAGGOTS, LICE AND RAIDERS--PRACTICES OF THESE HUMAN VERMIN--PLUNDERING\r\nTHE SICK AND DYING--NIGHT ATTACKS, AND BATTLES BY DAY--HARD TIMES FOR\r\nTHE SMALL TRADERS.\r\n\r\nWith each long, hot Summer hour the lice, the maggot-flies and the\r\nN’Yaarkers increased in numbers and venomous activity. They were\r\never-present annoyances and troubles; no time was free from them. The\r\nlice worried us by day and tormented us by night; the maggot-flies\r\nfouled our food, and laid in sores and wounds larvae that speedily\r\nbecame masses of wriggling worms. The N’Yaarkers were human vermin that\r\npreyed upon and harried us unceasingly.\r\n\r\nThey formed themselves into bands numbering from five to twenty-five,\r\neach led by a bold, unscrupulous, energetic scoundrel. We now called\r\nthem “Raiders,” and the most prominent and best known of the bands were\r\ncalled by the names of their ruffian leaders, as “Mosby’s Raiders,”\r\n“Curtis’s Raiders,” “Delaney’s Raiders,” “Sarsfield’s Raiders,”\r\n“Collins’s Raiders,” etc.\r\n\r\nAs long as we old prisoners formed the bulk of those inside the\r\nStockade, the Raiders had slender picking. They would occasionally\r\nsnatch a blanket from the tent poles, or knock a boy down at the\r\nCreek and take his silver watch from him; but this was all. Abundant\r\nopportunities for securing richer swag came to them with the advent of\r\nthe Plymouth Pilgrims. As had been before stated, these boys brought\r\nin with them a large portion of their first instalment of veteran\r\nbounty--aggregating in amount, according to varying estimates, between\r\ntwenty-five thousand and one hundred thousand dollars. The Pilgrims\r\nwere likewise well clothed, had an abundance of blankets and camp\r\nequipage, and a plentiful supply of personal trinkets, that could be\r\nreadily traded off to the Rebels. An average one of them--even if his\r\nmoney were all gone--was a bonanza to any band which could succeed in\r\nplundering him. His watch and chain, shoes, knife, ring, handkerchief,\r\ncombs and similar trifles, would net several hundred dollars in\r\nConfederate money. The blockade, which cut off the Rebel communication\r\nwith the outer world, made these in great demand. Many of the prisoners\r\nthat came in from the Army of the Potomac repaid robbing equally\r\nwell. As a rule those from that Army were not searched so closely as\r\nthose from the West, and not unfrequently they came in with all their\r\nbelongings untouched, where Sherman’s men, arriving the same day, would\r\nbe stripped nearly to the buff.\r\n\r\nThe methods of the Raiders were various, ranging all the way from sneak\r\nthievery to highway robbery. All the arts learned in the prisons and\r\npurlieus of New York were put into exercise. Decoys, “bunko-steerers”\r\nat home, would be on the look-out for promising subjects as each crowd\r\nof fresh prisoners entered the gate, and by kindly offers to find them\r\na sleeping place, lure them to where they could be easily despoiled\r\nduring the night. If the victim resisted there was always sufficient\r\nforce at hand to conquer him, and not seldom his life paid the penalty\r\nof his contumacy. I have known as many as three of these to be killed\r\nin a night, and their bodies--with throats cut, or skulls crushed\r\nin--be found in the morning among the dead at the gates.\r\n\r\nAll men having money or valuables were under continual espionage,\r\nand when found in places convenient for attack, a rush was made for\r\nthem. They were knocked down and their persons rifled with such swift\r\ndexterity that it was done before they realized what had happened.\r\n\r\nAt first these depredations were only perpetrated at night. The quarry\r\nwas selected during the day, and arrangements made for a descent. After\r\nthe victim was asleep the band dashed down upon him, and sheared him\r\nof his goods with incredible swiftness. Those near would raise the cry\r\nof “Raiders!” and attack the robbers. If the latter had secured their\r\nbooty they retreated with all possible speed, and were soon lost in\r\nthe crowd. If not, they would offer battle, and signal for assistance\r\nfrom the other bands. Severe engagements of this kind were of continual\r\noccurrence, in which men were so badly beaten as to die from the\r\neffects. The weapons used were fists, clubs, axes, tent-poles, etc.\r\nThe Raiders were plentifully provided with the usual weapons of their\r\nclass--slung-shots and brass-knuckles. Several of them had succeeded in\r\nsmuggling bowie-knives into prison.\r\n\r\nThey had the great advantage in these rows of being well acquainted\r\nwith each other, while, except the Plymouth Pilgrims, the rest of the\r\nprisoners were made up of small squads of men from each regiment in\r\nthe service, and total strangers to all outside of their own little\r\nband. The Raiders could concentrate, if necessary, four hundred or five\r\nhundred men upon any point of attack, and each member of the gangs had\r\nbecome so familiarized with all the rest by long association in New\r\nYork, and elsewhere, that he never dealt a blow amiss, while their\r\nopponents were nearly as likely to attack friends as enemies.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of June the continual success of the Raiders emboldened\r\nthem so that they no longer confined their depredations to the night,\r\nbut made their forays in broad daylight, and there was hardly an hour\r\nin the twenty-four that the cry of “Raiders! Raiders!” did, not go up\r\nfrom some part of the pen, and on looking in the direction of the cry,\r\none would see a surging commotion, men struggling, and clubs being\r\nplied vigorously. This was even more common than the guards shooting\r\nmen at the Creek crossing.\r\n\r\nOne day I saw “Dick Allen’s Raiders,” eleven in number, attack a man\r\nwearing the uniform of Ellett’s Marine Brigade. He was a recent comer,\r\nand alone, but he was brave. He had come into possession of a spade,\r\nby some means or another, and he used this with delightful vigor and\r\neffect. Two or three times he struck one of his assailants so fairly\r\non the head and with such good will that I congratulated myself that\r\nhe had killed him. Finally, Dick Allen managed to slip around behind\r\nhim unnoticed, and striking him on the head with a slung-shot, knocked\r\nhim down, when the whole crowd pounced upon him to kill him, but were\r\ndriven off by others rallying to his assistance.\r\n\r\nThe proceeds of these forays enabled the Raiders to wax fat and lusty,\r\nwhile others were dying from starvation. They all had good tents,\r\nconstructed of stolen blankets, and their headquarters was a large,\r\nroomy tent, with a circular top, situated on the street leading to\r\nthe South Gate, and capable of accommodating from seventy-five to one\r\nhundred men. All the material for this had been wrested away from\r\nothers. While hundreds were dying of scurvy and diarrhea, from the\r\nmiserable, insufficient food, and lack of vegetables, these fellows\r\nhad flour, fresh meat, onions, potatoes, green beans, and other\r\nthings, the very looks of which were a torture to hungry, scorbutic,\r\ndysenteric men. They were on the best possible terms with the Rebels,\r\nwhom they fawned upon and groveled before, and were in return allowed\r\nmany favors, in the way of trading, going out upon detail, and making\r\npurchases.\r\n\r\nAmong their special objects of attack were the small traders in the\r\nprison. We had quite a number of these whose genius for barter was\r\nso strong that it took root and flourished even in that unpropitious\r\nsoil, and during the time when new prisoners were constantly coming in\r\nwith money, they managed to accumulate small sums--from ten dollars\r\nupward, by trading between the guards and the prisoners. In the period\r\nimmediately following a prisoner’s entrance he was likely to spend\r\nall his money and trade off all his possessions for food, trusting to\r\nfortune to get him out of there when these were gone. Then was when\r\nhe was profitable to these go-betweens, who managed to make him pay\r\nhandsomely for what he got. The Raiders kept watch of these traders,\r\nand plundered them whenever occasion served. It reminded one of the\r\nhabits of the fishing eagle, which hovers around until some other bird\r\ncatches a fish, and then takes it away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nA COMMUNITY WITHOUT GOVERNMENT--FORMATION OF THE REGULATORS--RAIDERS\r\nATTACK KEY BUT ARE BLUFFED OFF--ASSAULT OF THE REGULATORS ON THE\r\nRAIDERS --DESPERATE BATTLE--OVERTHROW OF THE RAIDERS.\r\n\r\nTo fully appreciate the condition of affairs let it be remembered\r\nthat we were a community of twenty-five thousand boys and young\r\nmen--none too regardful of control at best--and now wholly destitute\r\nof government. The Rebels never made the slightest attempt to maintain\r\norder in the prison. Their whole energies were concentrated in\r\npreventing our escape. So long as we staid inside the Stockade, they\r\ncared as little what we did there as for the performances of savages\r\nin the interior of Africa. I doubt if they would have interfered had\r\none-half of us killed and eaten the other half. They rather took a\r\ndelight in such atrocities as came to their notice. It was an ocular\r\ndemonstration of the total depravity of the Yankees.\r\n\r\nAmong ourselves there was no one in position to lay down law and\r\nenforce it. Being all enlisted men we were on a dead level as far as\r\nrank was concerned--the highest being only Sergeants, whose stripes\r\ncarried no weight of authority. The time of our stay was--it was\r\nhoped--too transient to make it worth while bothering about organizing\r\nany form of government. The great bulk of the boys were recent comers,\r\nwho hoped that in another week or so they would be out again. There\r\nwere no fat salaries to tempt any one to take upon himself the duty of\r\nruling the masses, and all were left to their own devices, to do good\r\nor evil, according to their several bents, and as fear of consequences\r\nswayed them. Each little squad of men was a law unto themselves, and\r\nmade and enforced their own regulations on their own territory. The\r\nadministration of justice was reduced to its simplest terms. If a\r\nfellow did wrong he was pounded--if there was anybody capable of doing\r\nit. If not he went free.\r\n\r\nThe almost unvarying success of the Raiders in--their forays gave the\r\ngeneral impression that they were invincible--that is, that not enough\r\nmen could be concentrated against them to whip them. Our ill-success in\r\nthe attack we made on them in April helped us to the same belief. If we\r\ncould not beat them then, we could not now, after we had been enfeebled\r\nby months of starvation and disease. It seemed to us that the Plymouth\r\nPilgrims, whose organization was yet very strong, should undertake\r\nthe task; but, as is usually the case in this world, where we think\r\nsomebody else ought to undertake the performance of a disagreeable\r\npublic duty, they did not see it in the light that we wished them to.\r\nThey established guards around their squads, and helped beat off the\r\nRaiders when their own territory was invaded, but this was all they\r\nwould do. The rest of us formed similar guards. In the southwest corner\r\nof the Stockade--where I was--we formed ourselves into a company of\r\nfifty active boys--mostly belonging to my own battalion and to other\r\nIllinois regiments--of which I was elected Captain. My First Lieutenant\r\nwas a tall, taciturn, long-armed member of the One Hundred and Eleventh\r\nIllinois, whom we called “Egypt,” as he came from that section of\r\nthe State. He was wonderfully handy with his fists. I think he could\r\nknock a fellow down so that he would fall-harder, and lie longer than\r\nany person I ever saw. We made a tacit division of duties: I did the\r\ntalking, and “Egypt” went through the manual labor of knocking our\r\nopponents down. In the numerous little encounters in which our company\r\nwas engaged, “Egypt” would stand by my side, silent, grim and patient,\r\nwhile I pursued the dialogue with the leader of the other crowd. As\r\nsoon as he thought the conversation had reached the proper point, his\r\nlong left arm stretched out like a flash, and the other fellow dropped\r\nas if he had suddenly come in range of a mule that was feeling well.\r\nThat unexpected left-hander never failed. It would have made Charles\r\nReade’s heart leap for joy to see it.\r\n\r\nIn spite of our company and our watchfulness, the Raiders beat us\r\nbadly on one occasion. Marion Friend, of Company I of our battalion,\r\nwas one of the small traders, and had accumulated forty dollars by his\r\nbartering. One evening at dusk Delaney’s Raiders, about twenty-five\r\nstrong, took advantage of the absence of most of us drawing rations, to\r\nmake a rush for Marion. They knocked him down, cut him across the wrist\r\nand neck with a razor, and robbed him of his forty dollars. By the time\r\nwe could rally Delaney and his attendant scoundrels were safe from\r\npursuit in the midst of their friends.\r\n\r\nThis state of things had become unendurable. Sergeant Leroy L. Key,\r\nof Company M, our battalion, resolved to make an effort to crush the\r\nRaiders. He was a printer, from Bloomington, Illinois, tall, dark,\r\nintelligent and strong-willed, and one of the bravest men I ever knew.\r\nHe was ably seconded by “Limber Jim,” of the Sixty-Seventh Illinois,\r\nwhose lithe, sinewy form, and striking features reminded one of a young\r\nSioux brave. He had all of Key’s desperate courage, but not his brains\r\nor his talent for leadership. Though fearfully reduced in numbers, our\r\nbattalion had still about one hundred well men in it, and these formed\r\nthe nucleus for Key’s band of “Regulators,” as they were styled. Among\r\nthem were several who had no equals in physical strength and courage\r\nin any of the Raider chiefs. Our best man was Ned Carrigan, Corporal\r\nof Company I, from Chicago--who was so confessedly the best man in the\r\nwhole prison that he was never called upon to demonstrate it. He was a\r\nbig-hearted, genial Irish boy, who was never known to get into trouble\r\non his own account, but only used his fists when some of his comrades\r\nwere imposed upon. He had fought in the ring, and on one occasion had\r\nkilled a man with a single blow of his fist, in a prize fight near\r\nSt. Louis. We were all very proud of him, and it was as good as an\r\nentertainment to us to see the noisiest roughs subside into deferential\r\nsilence as Ned would come among them, like some grand mastiff in the\r\nmidst of a pack of yelping curs. Ned entered into the regulating scheme\r\nheartily. Other stalwart specimens of physical manhood in our battalion\r\nwere Sergeant Goody, Ned Johnson, Tom Larkin, and others, who, while\r\nnot approaching Carrigan’s perfect manhood, were still more than a\r\nmatch for the best of the Raiders.\r\n\r\nKey proceeded with the greatest secrecy in the organization of his\r\nforces. He accepted none but Western men, and preferred Illinoisans,\r\nIowans, Kansans, Indianians and Ohioans. The boys from those States\r\nseemed to naturally go together, and be moved by the same motives. He\r\ninformed Wirz what he proposed doing, so that any unusual commotion\r\nwithin the prison might not be mistaken for an attempt upon the\r\nStockade, and made the excuse for opening with the artillery. Wirz,\r\nwho happened to be in a complaisant humor, approved of the design, and\r\nallowed him the use of the enclosure of the North Gate to confine his\r\nprisoners in.\r\n\r\nIn spite of Key’s efforts at secrecy, information as to his scheme\r\nreached the Raiders. It was debated at their headquarters, and decided\r\nthere that Key must be killed. Three men were selected to do this\r\nwork. They called on Key, a dusk, on the evening of the 2d of July. In\r\nresponse to their inquiries, he came out of the blanket-covered hole\r\non the hillside that he called his tent. They told him what they had\r\nheard, and asked if it was true. He said it was. One of them then drew\r\na knife, and the other two, “billies” to attack him. But, anticipating\r\ntrouble, Key had procured a revolver which one of the Pilgrims had\r\nbrought in in his knapsack and drawing this he drove them off, but\r\nwithout firing a shot.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence caused the greatest excitement. To us of the Regulators\r\nit showed that the Raiders had penetrated our designs, and were\r\nprepared for them. To the great majority of the prisoners it was the\r\nfirst intimation that such a thing was contemplated; the news spread\r\nfrom squad to squad with the greatest rapidity, and soon everybody was\r\ndiscussing the chances of the movement. For awhile men ceased their\r\ninterminable discussion of escape and exchange--let those over worked\r\nwords and themes have a rare spell of repose--and debated whether\r\nthe Raiders would whip the regulators, or the Regulators conquer the\r\nRaiders. The reasons which I have previously enumerated, induced a\r\ngeneral disbelief in the probability of our success. The Raiders were\r\nin good health well fed, used to operating together, and had the\r\nconfidence begotten by a long series of successes. The Regulators\r\nlacked in all these respects.\r\n\r\nWhether Key had originally fixed on the next day for making the attack,\r\nor whether this affair precipitated the crisis, I know not, but later\r\nin the evening he sent us all order: to be on our guard all night, and\r\nready for action the next morning.\r\n\r\nThere was very little sleep anywhere that night. The Rebels learned\r\nthrough their spies that something unusual was going on inside, and as\r\ntheir only interpretation of anything unusual there was a design upon\r\nthe Stockade, they strengthened the guards, took additional precautions\r\nin every way, and spent the hours in anxious anticipation.\r\n\r\nWe, fearing that the Raiders might attempt to frustrate the scheme\r\nby an attack in overpowering force on Key’s squad, which would be\r\naccompanied by the assassination of him and Limber Jim, held ourselves\r\nin readiness to offer any assistance that might be needed.\r\n\r\nThe Raiders, though confident of success, were no less exercised.\r\nThey threw out pickets to all the approaches to their headquarters,\r\nand provided otherwise against surprise. They had smuggled in some\r\ncanteens of a cheap, vile whisky made from sorghum--and they grew quite\r\nhilarious in their Big Tent over their potations. Two songs had long\r\nago been accepted by us as peculiarly the Raiders’ own--as some one in\r\ntheir crowd sang them nearly every evening, and we never heard them\r\nanywhere else. The first began:\r\n\r\n               In Athol lived a man named Jerry Lanagan;\r\n               He battered away till he hadn’t a pound.\r\n               His father he died, and he made him a man agin;\r\n               Left him a farm of ten acres of ground.\r\n\r\nThe other related the exploits of an Irish highwayman named Brennan,\r\nwhose chief virtue was that\r\n\r\n               What he rob-bed from the rich he gave unto the poor.\r\n\r\nAnd this was the villainous chorus in which they all joined, and sang in\r\nsuch a way as suggested highway robbery, murder, mayhem and arson:\r\n\r\n               Brennan on the moor!\r\n               Brennan on the moor!\r\n               Proud and undaunted stood\r\n               John Brennan on the moor.\r\n\r\nThey howled these two nearly the live-long night. They became\r\neventually quite monotonous to us, who were waiting and watching. It\r\nwould have been quite a relief if they had thrown in a new one every\r\nhour or so, by way of variety.\r\n\r\nMorning at last came. Our companies mustered on their grounds, and then\r\nmarched to the space on the South Side where the rations were issued.\r\nEach man was armed with a small club, secured to his wrist by a string.\r\n\r\nThe Rebels--with their chronic fear of an outbreak animating them--had\r\nall the infantry in line of battle with loaded guns. The cannon in the\r\nworks were shotted, the fuses thrust into the touch-holes and the men\r\nstood with lanyards in hand ready to mow down everybody, at any instant.\r\n\r\nThe sun rose rapidly through the clear sky, which soon glowed down on\r\nus like a brazen oven. The whole camp gathered where it could best view\r\nthe encounter. This was upon the North Side. As I have before explained\r\nthe two sides sloped toward each other like those of a great trough.\r\nThe Raiders’ headquarters stood upon the center of the southern slope,\r\nand consequently those standing on the northern slope saw everything as\r\nif upon the stage of a theater.\r\n\r\nWhile standing in ranks waiting the orders to move, one of my comrades\r\ntouched me on the arm, and said:\r\n\r\n“My God! just look over there!”\r\n\r\nI turned from watching the Rebel artillerists, whose intentions gave\r\nme more uneasiness than anything else, and looked in the direction\r\nindicated by the speaker. The sight was the strangest one my eyes\r\never encountered. There were at least fifteen thousand perhaps twenty\r\nthousand--men packed together on the bank, and every eye was turned on\r\nus. The slope was such that each man’s face showed over the shoulders\r\nof the one in front of him, making acres on acres of faces. It was\r\nas if the whole broad hillside was paved or thatched with human\r\ncountenances.\r\n\r\nWhen all was ready we moved down upon the Big Tent, in as good order\r\nas we could preserve while passing through the narrow tortuous paths\r\nbetween the tents. Key, Limber Jim, Ned Carigan, Goody, Tom Larkin, and\r\nNed Johnson led the advance with their companies. The prison was as\r\nsilent as a graveyard. As we approached, the Raiders massed themselves\r\nin a strong, heavy line, with the center, against which our advance was\r\nmoving, held by the most redoubtable of their leaders. How many there\r\nwere of them could not be told, as it was impossible to say where their\r\nline ended and the mass of spectators began. They could not themselves\r\ntell, as the attitude of a large portion of the spectators would be\r\ndetermined by which way the battle went.\r\n\r\nNot a blow was struck until the lines came close together. Then the\r\nRaider center launched itself forward against ours, and grappled\r\nsavagely with the leading Regulators. For an instant--it seemed an\r\nhour--the struggle was desperate.\r\n\r\nStrong, fierce men clenched and strove to throttle each other; great\r\nmuscles strained almost to bursting, and blows with fist and club-dealt\r\nwith all the energy of mortal hate--fell like hail. One-perhaps\r\ntwo-endless minutes the lines surged--throbbed--backward and forward a\r\nstep or two, and then, as if by a concentration of mighty effort, our\r\nmen flung the Raider line back from it--broken--shattered. The next\r\ninstant our leaders were striding through the mass like raging lions.\r\nCarrigan, Limber Jim, Larkin, Johnson and Goody each smote down a swath\r\nof men before them, as they moved resistlessly forward.\r\n\r\nWe light weights had been sent around on the flanks to separate the\r\nspectators from the combatants, strike the Raiders ‘en revers,’ and, as\r\nfar as possible, keep the crowd from reinforcing them.\r\n\r\nIn five minutes after the first blow--was struck the overthrow of the\r\nRaiders was complete. Resistance ceased, and they sought safety in\r\nflight.\r\n\r\nAs the result became apparent to the--watchers on the opposite\r\nhillside, they vented their pent-up excitement in a yell that made the\r\nvery ground tremble, and we answered them with a shout that expressed\r\nnot only our exultation over our victory, but our great relief from the\r\nintense strain we had long borne.\r\n\r\nWe picked up a few prisoners on the battle field, and retired without\r\nmaking any special effort to get any more then, as we knew, that they\r\ncould not escape us.\r\n\r\nWe were very tired, and very hungry. The time for drawing rations had\r\narrived. Wagons containing bread and mush had driven to the gates, but\r\nWirz would not allow these to be opened, lest in the excited condition\r\nof the men an attempt might be made to carry them. Key ordered\r\noperations to cease, that Wirz might be re-assured and let the rations\r\nenter. It was in vain. Wirz was thoroughly scared. The wagons stood\r\nout in the hot sun until the mush fermented and soured, and had to be\r\nthrown away, while we event rationless to bed, and rose the next day\r\nwith more than usually empty stomachs to goad us on to our work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nWHY THE REGULATORS WERE NOT ASSISTED BY THE ENTIRE CAMP--PECULIARITIES\r\nOF BOYS FROM DIFFERENT SECTIONS--HUNTING THE RAIDERS DOWN--EXPLOITS OF\r\nMY LEFT-HANDED LIEUTENANT--RUNNING THE GAUNTLET.\r\n\r\nI may not have made it wholly clear to the reader why we did not have\r\nthe active assistance of the whole prison in the struggle with the\r\nRaiders. There were many reasons for this. First, the great bulk of\r\nthe prisoners were new comers, having been, at the farthest, but three\r\nor four weeks in the Stockade. They did not comprehend the situation\r\nof affairs as we older prisoners did. They did not understand that\r\nall the outrages--or very nearly all--were the work of--a relatively\r\nsmall crowd of graduates from the metropolitan school of vice. The\r\nactivity and audacity of the Raiders gave them the impression that at\r\nleast half the able-bodied men in the Stockade were engaged in these\r\ndepredations. This is always the case. A half dozen burglars or other\r\nactive criminals in a town will produce the impression that a large\r\nportion of the population are law breakers. We never estimated that the\r\nraiding N’Yaarkers, with their spies and other accomplices, exceeded\r\nfive hundred, but it would have been difficult to convince a new\r\nprisoner that there were not thousands of them. Secondly, the prisoners\r\nwere made up of small squads from every regiment at the front along the\r\nwhole line from the Mississippi to the Atlantic. These were strangers\r\nto and distrustful of all out side their own little circles. The\r\nEastern men were especially so. The Pennsylvanians and New Yorkers each\r\nformed groups, and did not fraternize readily with those outside their\r\nState lines. The New Jerseyans held aloof from all the rest, while the\r\nMassachusetts soldiers had very little in Common with anybody--even\r\ntheir fellow New Englanders. The Michigan men were modified New\r\nEnglanders. They had the same tricks of speech; they said “I be”\r\nfor “I am,” and “haag” for “hog;” “Let me look at your knife half a\r\nsecond,” or “Give me just a sup of that water,” where we said simply\r\n“Lend me your knife,” or “hand me a drink.” They were less reserved\r\nthan the true Yankees, more disposed to be social, and, with all their\r\neccentricities, were as manly, honorable a set of fellows as it was\r\nmy fortune to meet with in the army. I could ask no better comrades\r\nthan the boys of the Third Michigan Infantry, who belonged to the same\r\n“Ninety” with me. The boys from Minnesota and Wisconsin were very much\r\nlike those from Michigan. Those from Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa and\r\nKansas all seemed cut off the same piece. To all intents and purposes\r\nthey might have come from the same County. They spoke the same dialect,\r\nread the same newspapers, had studied McGuffey’s Readers, Mitchell’s\r\nGeography, and Ray’s Arithmetics at school, admired the same great men,\r\nand held generally the same opinions on any given subject. It was never\r\ndifficult to get them to act in unison--they did it spontaneously;\r\nwhile it required an effort to bring about harmony of action with those\r\nfrom other sections. Had the Western boys in prison been thoroughly\r\nadvised of the nature of our enterprise, we could, doubtless, have\r\ncommanded their cordial assistance, but they were not, and there was no\r\nway in which it could be done readily, until after the decisive blow\r\nwas struck.\r\n\r\nThe work of arresting the leading Raiders went on actively all day on\r\nthe Fourth of July. They made occasional shows of fierce resistance,\r\nbut the events of the day before had destroyed their prestige, broken\r\ntheir confidence, and driven away from their support very many who\r\nfollowed their lead when they were considered all-powerful. They\r\nscattered from their former haunts, and mingled with the crowds in\r\nother parts of the prison, but were recognized, and reported to Key,\r\nwho sent parties to arrest them. Several times they managed to collect\r\nenough adherents to drive off the squads sent after them, but this\r\nonly gave them a short respite, for the squad would return reinforced,\r\nand make short work of them. Besides, the prisoners generally were\r\nbeginning to understand and approve of the Regulators’ movement, and\r\nwere disposed to give all the assistance needed.\r\n\r\nMyself and “Egypt,” my taciturn Lieutenant of the sinewy left arm, were\r\nsent with our company to arrest Pete Donnelly, a notorious character,\r\nand leader of, a bad crowd. He was more “knocker” than Raider, however.\r\nHe was an old Pemberton building acquaintance, and as we marched up to\r\nwhere he was standing at the head of his gathering clan, he recognized\r\nme and said:\r\n\r\n“Hello, Illinoy,” (the name by which I was generally known in prison)\r\n“what do you want here?”\r\n\r\nI replied, “Pete, Key has sent me for you. I want you to go to\r\nheadquarters.”\r\n\r\n“What the ---- does Key want with me?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know, I’m sure; he only said to bring you.”\r\n\r\n“But I haven’t had anything to do with them other snoozers you have\r\nbeen a-having trouble with.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know anything about that; you can talk to Key as to that. I\r\nonly know that we are sent for you.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you don’t think you can take me unless I choose to go? You haint\r\ngot anybody in that crowd big enough to make it worth while for him to\r\nwaste his time trying it.”\r\n\r\nI replied diffidently that one never knew what--he could do till he\r\ntried; that while none of us were very big, we were as willing a lot of\r\nlittle fellows as he ever saw, and if it were all the same to him, we\r\nwould undertake to waste a little time getting him to headquarters.\r\n\r\nThe conversation seemed unnecessarily long to “Egypt,” who stood by my\r\nside; about a half step in advance. Pete was becoming angrier and more\r\ndefiant every minute. His followers were crowding up to us, club in\r\nhand. Finally Pete thrust his fist in my face, and roared out:\r\n\r\n“By ---, I ain’t a going with ye, and ye can’t take me, you ---- ----\r\n---- ”\r\n\r\nThis was “Egypt’s” cue. His long left arm uncoupled like the loosening\r\nof the weight of a pile-driver. It caught Mr. Donnelly under the chin,\r\nfairly lifted him from his feet, and dropped him on his back among his\r\nfollowers. It seemed to me that the predominating expression in his\r\nface as he went, over was that of profound wonder as to where that blow\r\ncould have come from, and why he did not see it in time to dodge or\r\nward it off.\r\n\r\nAs Pete dropped, the rest of us stepped forward with our clubs, to\r\nengage his followers, while “Egypt” and one or two others tied his\r\nhands and otherwise secured him. But his henchmen made no effort to\r\nrescue him, and we carried him over to headquarters without molestation.\r\n\r\nThe work of arresting increased in interest and excitement until it\r\ndeveloped into the furore of a hunt, with thousands eagerly engaged\r\nin it. The Raiders’ tents were torn down and pillaged. Blankets, tent\r\npoles, and cooking utensils were carried off as spoils, and the ground\r\nwas dug over for secreted property. A large quantity of watches,\r\nchains, knives, rings, gold pens, etc., etc.--the booty of many a\r\nraid--was found, and helped to give impetus to the hunt. Even the Rebel\r\nQuartermaster, with the characteristic keen scent of the Rebels for\r\nspoils, smelled from the outside the opportunity for gaining plunder,\r\nand came in with a squad of Rebels equipped with spades, to dig for\r\nburied treasures. How successful he was I know not, as I took no part\r\nin any of the operations of that nature.\r\n\r\nIt was claimed that several skeletons of victims of the Raiders were\r\nfound buried beneath the tent. I cannot speak with any certainty as to\r\nthis, though my impression is that at least one was found.\r\n\r\nBy evening Key had perhaps one hundred and twenty-five of the most\r\nnoted Raiders in his hands. Wirz had allowed him the use of the small\r\nstockade forming the entrance to the North Gate to confine them in.\r\n\r\nThe next thing was the judgment and punishment of the arrested ones.\r\nFor this purpose Key organized a court martial composed of thirteen\r\nSergeants, chosen from the latest arrivals of prisoners, that they\r\nmight have no prejudice against the Raiders. I believe that a man named\r\nDick McCullough, belonging to the Third Missouri Cavalry, was the\r\nPresident of the Court. The trial was carefully conducted, with all\r\nthe formality of a legal procedure that the Court and those managing\r\nthe matter could remember as applicable to the crimes with which\r\nthe accused were charged. Each of these confronted by the witnesses\r\nwho testified against him, and allowed to cross-examine them to any\r\nextent he desired. The defense was managed by one of their crowd,\r\nthe foul-tongued Tombs shyster, Pete Bradley, of whom I have before\r\nspoken. Such was the fear of the vengeance of the Raiders and their\r\nfriends that many who had been badly abused dared not testify against\r\nthem, dreading midnight assassination if they did. Others would not go\r\nbefore the Court except at night. But for all this there was no lack\r\nof evidence; there were thousands who had been robbed and maltreated,\r\nor who had seen these outrages committed on others, and the boldness\r\nof the leaders in their bight of power rendered their identification a\r\nmatter of no difficulty whatever.\r\n\r\nThe trial lasted several days, and concluded with sentencing quite a\r\nlarge number to run the gauntlet, a smaller number to wear balls and\r\nchains, and the following six to be hanged:\r\n\r\n  John Sarsfield, One Hundred and Forty-Fourth New York.\r\n  William Collins, alias “Mosby,” Company D, Eighty-Eighth Pennsylvania,\r\n  Charles Curtis, Company A, Fifth Rhode Island Artillery.\r\n  Patrick Delaney, Company E, Eighty-Third Pennsylvania.\r\n  A. Muir, United States Navy.\r\n  Terence Sullivan, Seventy-Second New York.\r\n\r\nThese names and regiments are of little consequence, however, as I\r\nbelieve all the rascals were professional bounty-jumpers, and did not\r\nbelong to any regiment longer than they could find an opportunity to\r\ndesert and join another.\r\n\r\nThose sentenced to ball-and-chain were brought in immediately, and had\r\nthe irons fitted to them that had been worn by some of our men as a\r\npunishment for trying to escape.\r\n\r\nIt was not yet determined how punishment should be meted out to the\r\nremainder, but circumstances themselves decided the matter. Wirz\r\nbecame tired of guarding so large a number as Key had arrested, and\r\nhe informed Key that he should turn them back into the Stockade\r\nimmediately. Key begged for little farther time to consider the\r\ndisposition of the cases, but Wirz refused it, and ordered the Officer\r\nof the Guard to return all arrested, save those sentenced to death, to\r\nthe Stockade. In the meantime the news had spread through the prison\r\nthat the Raiders were to be sent in again unpunished, and an angry\r\nmob, numbering some thousands, and mostly composed of men who had\r\nsuffered injuries at the hands of the marauders, gathered at the South\r\nGate, clubs in hand, to get such satisfaction as they could out of the\r\nrascals. They formed in two long, parallel lines, facing inward, and\r\ngrimly awaited the incoming of the objects of their vengeance.\r\n\r\nThe Officer of the Guard opened the wicket in the gate, and began\r\nforcing the Raiders through it--one at a time--at the point of the\r\nbayonet, and each as he entered was told what he already realized\r\nwell--that he must run for his life. They did this with all the energy\r\nthat they possessed, and as they ran blows rained on their heads, arms\r\nand backs. If they could succeed in breaking through the line at any\r\nplace they were generally let go without any further punishment. Three\r\nof the number were beaten to death. I saw one of these killed. I had no\r\nliking for the gauntlet performance, and refused to have anything to\r\ndo with it, as did most, if not all, of my crowd. While the gauntlet\r\nwas in operation, I was standing by my tent at the head of a little\r\nstreet, about two hundred feet from the line, watching what was being\r\ndone. A sailor was let in. He had a large bowie knife concealed about\r\nhis person somewhere, which he drew, and struck savagely with at his\r\ntormentors on either side. They fell back from before him, but closed\r\nin behind and pounded him terribly. He broke through the line, and ran\r\nup the street towards me. About midway of the distance stood a boy\r\nwho had helped carry a dead man out during the day, and while out had\r\nsecured a large pine rail which he had brought in with him. He was\r\nholding this straight up in the air, as if at a “present arms.” He\r\nseemed to have known from the first that the Raider would run that way.\r\nJust as he came squarely under it, the boy dropped the rail like the\r\nbar of a toll gate. It struck the Raider across the head, felled him as\r\nif by a shot, and his pursuers then beat him to death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE EXECUTION--BUILDING THE SCAFFOLD--DOUBTS OF THE CAMP-CAPTAIN\r\nWIRZ THINKS IT IS PROBABLY A RUSE TO FORCE THE STOCKADE--HIS\r\nPREPARATIONS AGAINST SUCH AN ATTEMPT--ENTRANCE OF THE DOOMED\r\nONES--THEY REALIZE THEIR FATE--ONE MAKES A DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO\r\nESCAPE--HIS RECAPTURE--INTENSE EXCITEMENT--WIRZ ORDERS THE GUNS TO\r\nOPEN--FORTUNATELY THEY DO NOT--THE SIX ARE HANGED--ONE BREAKS HIS\r\nROPE--SCENE WHEN THE RAIDERS ARE CUT DOWN.\r\n\r\nIt began to be pretty generally understood through the prison that\r\nsix men had been sentenced to be hanged, though no authoritative\r\nannouncement of the fact had been made. There was much canvassing\r\nas to where they should be executed, and whether an attempt to hang\r\nthem inside of the Stockade would not rouse their friends to make a\r\ndesperate effort to rescue them, which would precipitate a general\r\nengagement of even larger proportions than that of the 3d. Despite\r\nthe result of the affairs of that and the succeeding days, the camp\r\nwas not yet convinced that the Raiders were really conquered, and the\r\nRegulators themselves were not thoroughly at ease on that score. Some\r\nfive thousand or six thousand new prisoners had come in since the first\r\nof the month, and it was claimed that the Raiders had received large\r\nreinforcements from those,--a claim rendered probable by most of the\r\nnew-comers being from the Army of the Potomac.\r\n\r\nKey and those immediately about him kept their own counsel in the\r\nmatter, and suffered no secret of their intentions to leak out, until\r\non the morning of the 11th, when it became generally known that the\r\nsentences were too be carried into effect that day, and inside the\r\nprison.\r\n\r\nMy first direct information as to this was by a messenger from Key with\r\nan order to assemble my company and stand guard over the carpenters\r\nwho were to erect the scaffold. He informed me that all the Regulators\r\nwould be held in readiness to come to our relief if we were attacked in\r\nforce. I had hoped that if the men were to be hanged I would be spared\r\nthe unpleasant duty of assisting, for, though I believed they richly\r\ndeserved that punishment, I had much rather some one else administered\r\nit upon them. There was no way out of it, however, that I could see,\r\nand so “Egypt” and I got the boys together, and marched down to the\r\ndesignated place, which was an open space near the end of the street\r\nrunning from the South Gate, and kept vacant for the purpose of issuing\r\nrations. It was quite near the spot where the Raiders’ Big Tent had\r\nstood, and afforded as good a view to the rest of the camp as could be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nKey had secured the loan of a few beams and rough planks, sufficient\r\nto build a rude scaffold with. Our first duty was to care for these\r\nas they came in, for such was the need of wood, and plank for tent\r\npurposes, that they would scarcely have fallen to the ground before\r\nthey were spirited away, had we not stood over them all the time with\r\nclubs.\r\n\r\nThe carpenters sent by Key came over and set to work. The N’Yaarkers\r\ngathered around in considerable numbers, sullen and abusive. They\r\ncursed us with all their rich vocabulary of foul epithets, vowed that\r\nwe should never carry out the execution, and swore that they had marked\r\neach one for vengeance. We returned the compliments in kind, and\r\noccasionally it seemed as if a general collision was imminent; but we\r\nsucceeded in avoiding this, and by noon the scaffold was finished. It\r\nwas a very simple affair. A stout beam was fastened on the top of two\r\nposts, about fifteen feet high. At about the height of a man’s head\r\na couple of boards stretched across the space between the posts, and\r\nmet in the center. The ends at the posts laid on cleats; the ends in\r\nthe center rested upon a couple of boards, standing upright, and each\r\nhaving a piece of rope fastened through a hole in it in such a manner,\r\nthat a man could snatch it from under the planks serving as the floor\r\nof the scaffold, and let the whole thing drop. A rude ladder to ascend\r\nby completed the preparations.\r\n\r\nAs the arrangements neared completion the excitement in and around the\r\nprison grew intense. Key came over with the balance of the Regulators,\r\nand we formed a hollow square around the scaffold, our company marking\r\nthe line on the East Side. There were now thirty thousand in the\r\nprison. Of these about one-third packed themselves as tightly about our\r\nsquare as they could stand. The remaining twenty thousand were wedged\r\ntogether in a solid mass on the North Side. Again I contemplated the\r\nwonderful, startling, spectacle of a mosaic pavement of human faces\r\ncovering the whole broad hillside.\r\n\r\nOutside, the Rebel, infantry was standing in the rifle pits, the\r\nartillerymen were in place about their loaded and trained pieces, the\r\nNo. 4 of each gun holding the lanyard cord in his hand, ready to fire\r\nthe piece at the instant of command. The small squad of cavalry was\r\ndrawn up on the hill near the Star Fort, and near it were the masters\r\nof the hounds, with their yelping packs.\r\n\r\nAll the hangers-on of the Rebel camp--clerks, teamsters, employer,\r\nnegros, hundreds of white and colored women, in all forming a motley\r\ncrowd of between one and two thousand, were gathered together in a\r\ngroup between the end of the rifle pits and the Star Fort. They had a\r\ngood view from there, but a still better one could be had, a little\r\nfarther to the right, and in front of the guns. They kept edging up in\r\nthat direction, as crowds will, though they knew the danger they would\r\nincur if the artillery opened.\r\n\r\nThe day was broiling hot. The sun shot his perpendicular rays down with\r\nblistering fierceness, and the densely packed, motionless crowds made\r\nthe heat almost insupportable.\r\n\r\nKey took up his position inside the square to direct matters. With him\r\nwere Limber Jim, Dick McCullough, and one or two others. Also, Ned\r\nJohnson, Tom Larkin, Sergeant Goody, and three others who were to act\r\nas hangmen. Each of these six was provided with a white sack, such as\r\nthe Rebels brought in meal in. Two Corporals of my company--“Stag”\r\nHarris and Wat Payne--were appointed to pull the stays from under the\r\nplatform at the signal.\r\n\r\nA little after noon the South Gate opened, and Wirz rode in, dressed\r\nin a suit of white duck, and mounted on his white horse--a conjunction\r\nwhich had gained for him the appellation of “Death on a Pale Horse.”\r\nBehind him walked the faithful old priest, wearing his Church’s purple\r\ninsignia of the deepest sorrow, and reading the service for the\r\ncondemned. The six doomed men followed, walking between double ranks of\r\nRebel guards.\r\n\r\nAll came inside the hollow square and halted. Wirz then said:\r\n\r\n“Brizners, I return to you dose men so Boot as I got dem. You haf tried\r\ndem yourselves, and found dem guilty--I haf had notting to do wit it. I\r\nvash my hands of eferyting connected wit dem. Do wit dem as you like,\r\nand may Gott haf mercy on you and on dem. Garts, about face! Voryvarts,\r\nmarch!”\r\n\r\nWith this he marched out and left us.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the condemned looked stunned. They seemed to comprehend\r\nfor the first time that it was really the determination of the\r\nRegulators to hang them. Before that they had evidently thought that\r\nthe talk of hanging was merely bluff. One of them gasped out:\r\n\r\n“My God, men, you don’t really mean to hang us up there!”\r\n\r\nKey answered grimly and laconically:\r\n\r\n“That seems to be about the size of it.”\r\n\r\nAt this they burst out in a passionate storm of intercessions and\r\nimprecations, which lasted for a minute or so, when it was stopped by\r\none of them saying imperatively:\r\n\r\n“All of you stop now, and let the priest talk for us.”\r\n\r\nAt this the priest closed the book upon which he had kept his eyes bent\r\nsince his entrance, and facing the multitude on the North Side began a\r\nplea for mercy.\r\n\r\nThe condemned faced in the same direction, to read their fate in the\r\ncountenances of those whom he was addressing. This movement brought\r\nCurtis--a low-statured, massively built man--on the right of their\r\nline, and about ten or fifteen steps from my company.\r\n\r\nThe whole camp had been as still as death since Wirz’s exit. The\r\nsilence seemed to become even more profound as the priest began his\r\nappeal. For a minute every ear was strained to catch what he said.\r\nThen, as the nearest of the thousands comprehended what he was saying\r\nthey raised a shout of “No! no!! NO!!” “Hang them! hang them!” “Don’t\r\nlet them go! Never!”\r\n\r\n“Hang the rascals! hang the villains!”\r\n\r\n“Hang, ’em! hang ’em! hang ’em!”\r\n\r\nThis was taken up all over the prison, and tens of thousands throats\r\nyelled it in a fearful chorus.\r\n\r\nCurtis turned from the crowd with desperation convulsing his features.\r\nTearing off the broad-brimmed hat which he wore, he flung it on the\r\nground with the exclamation!\r\n\r\n“By God, I’ll die this way first!” and, drawing his head down and\r\nfolding his arms about it, he dashed forward for the center of my\r\ncompany, like a great stone hurled from a catapult.\r\n\r\n“Egypt” and I saw where he was going to strike, and ran down the line\r\nto help stop him. As he came up we rained blows on his head with our\r\nclubs, but so many of us struck at him at once that we broke each\r\nother’s clubs to pieces, and only knocked him on his knees. He rose\r\nwith an almost superhuman effort, and plunged into the mass beyond.\r\n\r\nThe excitement almost became delirium. For an instant I feared that\r\neverything was gone to ruin. “Egypt” and I strained every energy to\r\nrestore our lines, before the break could be taken advantage of by\r\nthe others. Our boys behaved splendidly, standing firm, and in a few\r\nseconds the line was restored.\r\n\r\nAs Curtis broke through, Delaney, a brawny Irishman standing next to\r\nhim, started to follow. He took one step. At the same instant Limber\r\nJim’s long legs took three great strides, and placed him directly in\r\nfront of Delaney. Jim’s right hand held an enormous bowie-knife, and as\r\nhe raised it above Delaney he hissed out:\r\n\r\n“If you dare move another step, I’ll open you ---- ---- ----, I’ll open\r\nyou from one end to the other.\r\n\r\nDelaney stopped. This checked the others till our lines reformed.\r\n\r\nWhen Wirz saw the commotion he was panic-stricken with fear that the\r\nlong-dreaded assault on the Stockade had begun. He ran down from the\r\nheadquarter steps to the Captain of the battery, shrieking:\r\n\r\n“Fire! fire! fire!”\r\n\r\nThe Captain, not being a fool, could see that the rush was not towards\r\nthe Stockade, but away from it, and he refrained from giving the order.\r\n\r\nBut the spectators who had gotten before the guns, heard Wirz’s\r\nexcited yell, and remembering the consequences to themselves should\r\nthe artillery be discharged, became frenzied with fear, and screamed,\r\nand fell down over and trampled upon each other in endeavoring to get\r\naway. The guards on that side of the Stockade ran down in a panic, and\r\nthe ten thousand prisoners immediately around us, expecting no less\r\nthan that the next instant we would be swept with grape and canister,\r\nstampeded tumultuously. There were quite a number of wells right around\r\nus, and all of these were filled full of men that fell into them as the\r\ncrowd rushed away. Many had legs and arms broken, and I have no doubt\r\nthat several were killed.\r\n\r\nIt was the stormiest five minutes that I ever saw.\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on two of my company, belonging to the Fifth Iowa\r\nCavalry, were in hot pursuit of Curtis. I had seen them start and\r\nshouted to them to come back, as I feared they would be set upon by the\r\nRaiders and murdered. But the din was so overpowering that they could\r\nnot hear me, and doubtless would not have come back if they had heard.\r\n\r\nCurtis ran diagonally down the hill, jumping over the tents and\r\nknocking down the men who happened in his way. Arriving at the swamp\r\nhe plunged in, sinking nearly to his hips in the fetid, filthy ooze.\r\nHe forged his way through with terrible effort. His pursuers followed\r\nhis example, and caught up to him just as he emerged on the other side.\r\nThey struck him on the back of the head with their clubs, and knocked\r\nhim down.\r\n\r\nBy this time order had been restored about us. The guns remained\r\nsilent, and the crowd massed around us again. From where we were we\r\ncould see the successful end of the chase after Curtis, and could see\r\nhis captors start back with him. Their success was announced with a\r\nroar of applause from the North Side. Both captors and captured were\r\ngreatly exhausted, and they were coming back very slowly. Key ordered\r\nthe balance up on to the scaffold. They obeyed promptly. The priest\r\nresumed his reading of the service for the condemned. The excitement\r\nseemed to make the doomed ones exceedingly thirsty. I never saw\r\nmen drink such inordinate quantities of water. They called for it\r\ncontinually, gulped down a quart or more at a time, and kept two men\r\ngoing nearly all the time carrying it to them.\r\n\r\nWhen Curtis finally arrived, he sat on the ground for a minute or so,\r\nto rest, and then, reeking with filth, slowly and painfully climbed the\r\nsteps. Delaney seemed to think he was suffering as much from fright as\r\nanything else, and said to him:\r\n\r\n“Come on up, now, show yourself a man, and die game.”\r\n\r\nAgain the priest resumed his reading, but it had no interest to\r\nDelaney, who kept calling out directions to Pete Donelly, who was\r\nstanding in the crowd, as to dispositions to be made of certain bits of\r\nstolen property: to give a watch to this one, a ring to another, and so\r\non. Once the priest stopped and said:\r\n\r\n“My son, let the things of this earth go, and turn your attention\r\ntoward those of heaven.”\r\n\r\nDelaney paid no attention to this admonition. The whole six then began\r\ndelivering farewell messages to those in the crowd. Key pulled a watch\r\nfrom his pocket and said:\r\n\r\n“Two minutes more to talk.”\r\n\r\nDelaney said cheerfully:\r\n\r\n“Well, good by, b’ys; if I’ve hurted any of y ez, I hope ye’ll forgive\r\nme. Shpake up, now, any of yez that I’ve hurted, and say yell forgive\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nWe called upon Marion Friend, whose throat Delaney had tried to cut\r\nthree weeks before while robbing him of forty dollars, to come forward,\r\nbut Friend was not in a forgiving mood, and refused with an oath.\r\n\r\nKey said:\r\n\r\n“Time’s up!” put the watch back in his pocket and raised his hand like\r\nan officer commanding a gun. Harris and Payne laid hold of the ropes to\r\nthe supports of the planks. Each of the six hangmen tied a condemned\r\nman’s hands, pulled a meal sack down over his head, placed the noose\r\naround his neck, drew it up tolerably close, and sprang to the ground.\r\nThe priest began praying aloud.\r\n\r\nKey dropped his hand. Payne and Harris snatched the supports out with\r\na single jerk. The planks fell with a clatter. Five of the bodies\r\nswung around dizzily in the air. The sixth that of “Mosby,” a large,\r\npowerful, raw-boned man, one of the worst in the lot, and who, among\r\nother crimes, had killed Limber Jim’s brother-broke the rope, and fell\r\nwith a thud to the ground. Some of the men ran forward, examined the\r\nbody, and decided that he still lived. The rope was cut off his neck,\r\nthe meal sack removed, and water thrown in his face until consciousness\r\nreturned. At the first instant he thought he was in eternity. He gasped\r\nout:\r\n\r\n“Where am I? Am I in the other world?”\r\n\r\nLimber Jim muttered that they would soon show him where he was, and\r\nwent on grimly fixing up the scaffold anew. “Mosby” soon realized what\r\nhad happened, and the unrelenting purpose of the Regulator Chiefs. Then\r\nhe began to beg piteously for his life, saying:\r\n\r\n“O for God’s sake, do not put me up there again! God has spared my life\r\nonce. He meant that you should be merciful to me.”\r\n\r\nLimber Jim deigned him no reply. When the scaffold was rearranged, and\r\na stout rope had replaced the broken one, he pulled the meal sack once\r\nmore over “Mosby’s” head, who never ceased his pleadings. Then picking\r\nup the large man as if he were a baby, he carried him to the scaffold\r\nand handed him up to Tom Larkin, who fitted the noose around his neck\r\nand sprang down. The supports had not been set with the same delicacy\r\nas at first, and Limber Jim had to set his heel and wrench desperately\r\nat them before he could force them out. Then “Mosby” passed away\r\nwithout a struggle.\r\n\r\nAfter hanging till life was extinct, the bodies were cut down, the\r\nmeal-sacks pulled off their faces, and the Regulators formal two\r\nparallel lines, through which all the prisoners passed and took a look\r\nat the bodies. Pete Donnelly and Dick Allen knelt down and wiped the\r\nfroth off Delaney’s lips, and swore vengeance against those who had\r\ndone him to death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nAFTER THE EXECUTION--FORMATION OF A POLICE FORCE--ITS FIRST CHIEF\r\n--“SPANKING” AN OFFENDER.\r\n\r\nAfter the executions Key, knowing that he, and all those prominently\r\nconnected with the hanging, would be in hourly danger of assassination\r\nif they remained inside, secured details as nurses and ward-masters in\r\nthe hospital, and went outside. In this crowd were Key, Ned Carrigan,\r\nLimber Jim, Dick McCullough, the six hangmen, the two Corporals who\r\npulled the props from under the scaffold, and perhaps some others whom\r\nI do not now remember.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile provision had been made for the future maintenance\r\nof order in the prison by the organization of a regular police force,\r\nwhich in time came to number twelve hundred men. These were divided\r\ninto companies, under appropriate officers. Guards were detailed for\r\ncertain locations, patrols passed through the camp in all directions\r\ncontinually, and signals with whistles could summon sufficient\r\nassistance to suppress any disturbance, or carry out any orders from\r\nthe chief.\r\n\r\nThe chieftainship was first held by Key, but when he went outside he\r\nappointed Sergeant A. R. Hill, of the One Hundredth O. V. I.--now\r\na resident of Wauseon, Ohio,--his successor. Hill was one of the\r\nnotabilities of that immense throng. A great, broad-shouldered, giant,\r\nin the prime of his manhood--the beginning of his thirtieth year--he\r\nwas as good-natured as big, and as mild-mannered as brave. He spoke\r\nslowly, softly, and with a slightly rustic twang, that was very\r\ntempting to a certain class of sharps to take him up for a “luberly\r\ngreeny.” The man who did so usually repented his error in sack-cloth\r\nand ashes.\r\n\r\nHill first came into prominence as the victor in the most stubbornly\r\ncontested fight in the prison history of Belle Isle. When the squad of\r\nthe One Hundredth Ohio--captured at Limestone Station, East Tennessee,\r\nin September, 1863--arrived on Belle Isle, a certain Jack Oliver, of the\r\nNineteenth Indiana, was the undisputed fistic monarch of the Island.\r\nHe did not bear his blushing honors modestly; few of a right arm that\r\nindefinite locality known as “the middle of next week,” is something\r\nthat the possessor can as little resist showing as can a girl her first\r\nsolitaire ring. To know that one can certainly strike a disagreeable\r\nfellow out of time is pretty sure to breed a desire to do that thing\r\nwhenever occasion serves. Jack Oliver was one who did not let his\r\nbiceps rust in inaction, but thrashed everybody on the Island whom he\r\nthought needed it, and his ideas as to those who should be included in\r\nthis class widened daily, until it began to appear that he would soon\r\nfeel it his duty to let no unwhipped man escape, but pound everybody on\r\nthe Island.\r\n\r\nOne day his evil genius led him to abuse a rather elderly man belonging\r\nto Hill’s mess. As he fired off his tirade of contumely, Hill said with\r\nmore than his usual “soft” rusticity:\r\n\r\n“Mister--I--don’t--think--it--just--right--for--a--young--man--to--call\r\n--an--old--one--such--bad names.”\r\n\r\nJack Oliver turned on him savagely.\r\n\r\n“Well! may be you want to take it up?”\r\n\r\nThe grin on Hill’s face looked still more verdant, as he answered with\r\ngentle deliberation:\r\n\r\n“Well--mister--I--don’t--go--around--a--hunting--things--but--I\r\n--ginerally--take--care--of--all--that’s--sent--me!”\r\n\r\nJack foamed, but his fiercest bluster could not drive that infantile\r\nsmile from Hill’s face, nor provoke a change in the calm slowness of\r\nhis speech.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that nothing would do but a battle-royal, and Jack\r\nhad sense enough to see that the imperturbable rustic was likely to\r\ngive him a job of some difficulty. He went off and came back with his\r\nclan, while Hill’s comrades of the One Hundredth gathered around to\r\ninsure him fair play. Jack pulled off his coat and vest, rolled up his\r\nsleeves, and made other elaborate preparations for the affray. Hill,\r\nwithout removing a garment, said, as he surveyed him with a mocking\r\nsmile:\r\n\r\n“Mister--you--seem--to--be--one--of--them--partick-e-ler--fellers.”\r\n\r\nJack roared out,\r\n\r\n“By ---, I’ll make you partickeler before I get through with you. Now,\r\nhow shall we settle this? Regular stand-up-and knock-down, or rough and\r\ntumble?”\r\n\r\nIf anything Hill’s face was more vacantly serene, and his tones blander\r\nthan ever, as he answered:\r\n\r\n“Strike--any--gait--that--suits--you,--Mister;--I guess--I--will--be\r\n--able--to--keep--up--with--you.”\r\n\r\nThey closed. Hill feinted with his left, and as Jack uncovered to\r\nguard, he caught him fairly on the lower left ribs, by a blow from his\r\nmighty right fist, that sounded--as one of the by-standers expressed\r\nit--“like striking a hollow log with a maul.”\r\n\r\nThe color in Jack’s face paled. He did not seem to understand how\r\nhe had laid himself open to such a pass, and made the same mistake,\r\nreceiving again a sounding blow in the short ribs. This taught him\r\nnothing, either, for again he opened his guard in response to a feint,\r\nand again caught a blow on his luckless left, ribs, that drove the\r\nblood from his face and the breath from his body. He reeled back\r\namong his supporters for an instant to breathe. Recovering his wind,\r\nbe dashed at Hill feinted strongly with his right, but delivered a\r\nterrible kick against the lower part of the latter’s abdomen. Both\r\nclosed and fought savagely at half-arm’s length for an instant;\r\nduring which Hill struck Jack so fairly in the mouth as to break out\r\nthree front teeth, which the latter swallowed. Then they clenched and\r\nstruggled to throw each other. Hill’s superior strength and skill\r\ncrushed his opponent to the ground, and he fell upon him. As they\r\ngrappled there, one of Jack’s followers sought to aid his leader by\r\ncatching Hill by the hair, intending to kick him in the face. In an\r\ninstant he was knocked down by a stalwart member of the One Hundredth,\r\nand then literally lifted out of the ring by kicks.\r\n\r\nJack was soon so badly beaten as to be unable to cry “enough!” One of\r\nhis friends did that service for him, the fight ceased, and thenceforth\r\nMr. Oliver resigned his pugilistic crown, and retired to the shades of\r\nprivate life. He died of scurvy and diarrhea, some months afterward, in\r\nAndersonville.\r\n\r\nThe almost hourly scenes of violence and crime that marked the days and\r\nnights before the Regulators began operations were now succeeded by the\r\ngreatest order. The prison was freer from crime than the best governed\r\nCity. There were frequent squabbles and fights, of course, and many\r\npetty larcenies. Rations of bread and of wood, articles of clothing,\r\nand the wretched little cans and half canteens that formed our cooking\r\nutensils, were still stolen, but all these were in a sneak-thief\r\nway. There was an entire absence of the audacious open-day robbery\r\nand murder --the “raiding” of the previous few weeks. The summary\r\npunishment inflicted on the condemned was sufficient to cow even bolder\r\nmen than the Raiders, and they were frightened into at least quiescence.\r\n\r\nSergeant Hill’s administration was vigorous, and secured the best\r\nresults. He became a judge of all infractions of morals and law, and\r\nsat at the door of his tent to dispense justice to all comers, like the\r\nCadi of a Mahometan Village. His judicial methods and punishments also\r\nreminded one strongly of the primitive judicature of Oriental lands.\r\nThe wronged one came before him and told his tale: he had his blouse,\r\nor his quart cup, or his shoes, or his watch, or his money stolen\r\nduring the night. The suspected one was also summoned, confronted with\r\nhis accuser, and sharply interrogated. Hill would revolve the stories\r\nin his mind, decide the innocence or guilt of the accused, and if he\r\nthought the accusation sustained, order the culprit to punishment. He\r\ndid not imitate his Mussulman prototypes to the extent of bowstringing\r\nor decapitating the condemned, nor did he cut any thief’s hands off,\r\nnor yet nail his ears to a doorpost, but he introduced a modification\r\nof the bastinado that made those who were punished by it even wish\r\nthey were dead. The instrument used was what is called in the South\r\na “shake” --a split shingle, a yard or more long, and with one end\r\nwhittled down to form a handle. The culprit was made to bend down until\r\nhe could catch around his ankles with his hands. The part of the body\r\nthus brought into most prominence was denuded of clothing and “spanked”\r\nfrom one to twenty times, as Hill ordered, by the “shake” in same\r\nstrong and willing hand. It was very amusing--to the bystanders. The\r\n“spankee” never seemed to enter very heartily into the mirth of the\r\noccasion. As a rule he slept on his face for a week or so after, and\r\ntook his meals standing.\r\n\r\nThe fear of the spanking, and Hill’s skill in detecting the guilty\r\nones, had a very salutary effect upon the smaller criminals.\r\n\r\nThe Raiders who had been put into irons were very restive under the\r\ninfliction, and begged Hill daily to release them. They professed the\r\ngreatest penitence, and promised the most exemplary behavior for the\r\nfuture. Hill refused to release them, declaring that they should wear\r\nthe irons until delivered up to our Government.\r\n\r\nOne of the Raiders--named Heffron--had, shortly after his arrest,\r\nturned State’s evidence, and given testimony that assisted materially\r\nin the conviction of his companions. One morning, a week or so after\r\nthe hanging, his body was found lying among the other dead at the South\r\nGate. The impression made by the fingers of the hand that had strangled\r\nhim, were still plainly visible about the throat. There was no doubt as\r\nto why he had been killed, or that the Raiders were his murderers, but\r\nthe actual perpetrators were never discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nJULY--THE PRISON BECOMES MORE CROWDED, THE WEATHER HOTTER, NATIONS\r\nPOORER, AND MORTALITY GREATER--SOME OF THE PHENOMENA OF SUFFERING AND\r\nDEATH.\r\n\r\nAll during July the prisoners came streaming in by hundreds and\r\nthousands from every portion of the long line of battle, stretching\r\nfrom the Eastern bank of the Mississippi to the shores of the Atlantic.\r\nOver one thousand squandered by Sturgis at Guntown came in; two\r\nthousand of those captured in the desperate blow dealt by Hood against\r\nthe Army of the Tennessee on the 22d of the month before Atlanta;\r\nhundreds from Hunter’s luckless column in the Shenandoah Valley,\r\nthousands from Grant’s lines in front of Petersburg. In all, seven\r\nthousand one hundred and twenty-eight were, during the month, turned\r\ninto that seething mass of corrupting humanity to be polluted and\r\ntainted by it, and to assist in turn to make it fouler and deadlier.\r\nOver seventy hecatombs of chosen victims --of fair youths in the\r\nfirst flush of hopeful manhood, at the threshold of a life of honor\r\nto themselves and of usefulness to the community; beardless boys,\r\nrich in the priceless affections of homes, fathers, mothers, sisters\r\nand sweethearts, with minds thrilling with high aspirations for the\r\nbright future, were sent in as the monthly sacrifice to this Minotaur\r\nof the Rebellion, who, couched in his foul lair, slew them, not with\r\nthe merciful delivery of speedy death, as his Cretan prototype did the\r\nannual tribute of Athenian youths and maidens, but, gloating over his\r\nprey, doomed them to lingering destruction. He rotted their flesh with\r\nthe scurvy, racked their minds with intolerable suspense, burned their\r\nbodies with the slow fire of famine, and delighted in each separate\r\npang, until they sank beneath the fearful accumulation. Theseus\r\n[Sherman. D.W.]--the deliverer--was coming. His terrible sword could\r\nbe seen gleaming as it rose and fell on the banks of the James, and\r\nin the mountains beyond Atlanta, where he was hewing his way towards\r\nthem and the heart of the Southern Confederacy. But he came too late\r\nto save them. Strike as swiftly and as heavily as he would, he could\r\nnot strike so hard nor so sure at his foes with saber blow and musket\r\nshot, as they could at the hapless youths with the dreadful armament of\r\nstarvation and disease.\r\n\r\nThough the deaths were one thousand eight hundred and seventeen more\r\nthan were killed at the battle of Shiloh--this left the number in\r\nthe prison at the end of the month thirty-one thousand six hundred\r\nand seventy-eight. Let me assist the reader’s comprehension of the\r\nmagnitude of this number by giving the population of a few important\r\nCities, according to the census of 1870:\r\n\r\nCambridge, Mass 89,639\r\nCharleston, S. C. 48,958\r\nColumbus, O. 31,274\r\nDayton, O. 30,473\r\nFall River, Mass 26,766\r\nKansas City, Mo 32,260\r\n\r\nThe number of prisoners exceeded the whole number of men between\r\nthe ages of eighteen and forty-five in several of the States and\r\nTerritories in the Union. Here, for instance, are the returns for 1870,\r\nof men of military age in some portions of the country:\r\n\r\nArizona 5,157\r\nColorado 15,166\r\nDakota 5,301\r\nIdaho 9,431\r\nMontana 12,418\r\nNebraska 35,677\r\nNevada 24,762\r\nNew Hampshire 60,684\r\nOregon 23,959\r\nRhode Island 44,377\r\nVermont 62,450\r\nWest Virginia 6,832\r\n\r\nIt was more soldiers than could be raised to-day, under strong\r\npressure, in either Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado,\r\nConnecticut, Dakota, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Idaho,\r\nLouisiana, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire,\r\nNew Medico, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Vermont or West\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nThese thirty-one thousand six hundred and seventy-eight active young\r\nmen, who were likely to find the confines of a State too narrow for\r\nthem, were cooped up on thirteen acres of ground--less than a farmer\r\ngives for play-ground for a half dozen colts or a small flock of sheep.\r\nThere was hardly room for all to lie down at night, and to walk a few\r\nhundred feet in any direction would require an hour’s patient threading\r\nof the mass of men and tents.\r\n\r\nThe weather became hotter and hotter; at midday the sand would burn\r\nthe hand. The thin skins of fair and auburn-haired men blistered under\r\nthe sun’s rays, and swelled up in great watery puffs, which soon\r\nbecame the breeding grounds of the hideous maggots, or the still more\r\ndeadly gangrene. The loathsome swamp grew in rank offensiveness with\r\nevery burning hour. The pestilence literally stalked at noon-day, and\r\nstruck his victims down on every hand. One could not look a rod in any\r\ndirection without seeing at least a dozen men in the last frightful\r\nstages of rotting Death.\r\n\r\nLet me describe the scene immediately around my own tent during the\r\nlast two weeks of July, as a sample of the condition of the whole\r\nprison: I will take a space not larger than a good sized parlor or\r\nsitting room. On this were at least fifty of us. Directly in front of\r\nme lay two brothers--named Sherwood--belonging to Company I, of my\r\nbattalion, who came originally from Missouri. They were now in the\r\nlast stages of scurvy and diarrhea. Every particle of muscle and fat\r\nabout their limbs and bodies had apparently wasted away, leaving the\r\nskin clinging close to the bone of the face, arms, hands, ribs and\r\nthighs--everywhere except the feet and legs, where it was swollen tense\r\nand transparent, distended with gallons of purulent matter. Their livid\r\ngums, from which most of their teeth had already fallen, protruded\r\nfar beyond their lips. To their left lay a Sergeant and two others\r\nof their company, all three slowly dying from diarrhea, and beyond\r\nwas a fair-haired German, young and intelligent looking, whose life\r\nwas ebbing tediously away. To my right was a handsome young Sergeant\r\nof an Illinois Infantry Regiment, captured at Kenesaw. His left arm\r\nhad been amputated between the shoulder and elbow, and he was turned\r\ninto the Stockade with the stump all undressed, save the ligating of\r\nthe arteries. Of course, he had not been inside an hour until the\r\nmaggot flies had laid eggs in the open wound, and before the day was\r\ngone the worms were hatched out, and rioting amid the inflamed and\r\nsuper-sensitive nerves, where their every motion was agony. Accustomed\r\nas we were to misery, we found a still lower depth in his misfortune,\r\nand I would be happier could I forget his pale, drawn face, as he\r\nwandered uncomplainingly to and fro, holding his maimed limb with his\r\nright hand, occasionally stopping to squeeze it, as one does a boil,\r\nand press from it a stream of maggots and pus. I do not think he ate or\r\nslept for a week before he died. Next to him staid an Irish Sergeant of\r\na New York Regiment, a fine soldierly man, who, with pardonable pride,\r\nwore, conspicuously on his left breast, a medal gained by gallantry\r\nwhile a British soldier in the Crimea. He was wasting away with\r\ndiarrhea, and died before the month was out.\r\n\r\nThis was what one could see on every square rod of the prison. Where I\r\nwas was not only no worse than the rest of the prison, but was probably\r\nmuch better and healthier, as it was the highest ground inside,\r\nfarthest from the Swamp, and having the dead line on two sides, had a\r\nventilation that those nearer the center could not possibly have. Yet,\r\nwith all these conditions in our favor, the mortality was as I have\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nNear us an exasperating idiot, who played the flute, had established\r\nhimself. Like all poor players, he affected the low, mournful notes, as\r\nplaintive as the distant cooing of the dove in lowering, weather. He\r\nplayed or rather tooted away in his “blues”-inducing strain hour after\r\nhour, despite our energetic protests, and occasionally flinging a club\r\nat him. There was no more stop to him than to a man with a hand-organ,\r\nand to this day the low, sad notes of a flute are the swiftest reminder\r\nto me of those sorrowful, death-laden days.\r\n\r\nI had an illustration one morning of how far decomposition would\r\nprogress in a man’s body before he died. My chum and I found a\r\ntreasure-trove in the streets, in the shape of the body of a man who\r\ndied during the night. The value of this “find” was that if we took it\r\nto the gate, we would be allowed to carry it outside to the deadhouse,\r\nand on our way back have an opportunity to pick up a chunk of wood, to\r\nuse in cooking. While discussing our good luck another party came up\r\nand claimed the body. A verbal dispute led to one of blows, in which\r\nwe came off victorious, and I hastily caught hold of the arm near the\r\nelbow to help bear the body away. The skin gave way under my hand,\r\nand slipped with it down to the wrist, like a torn sleeve. It was\r\nsickening, but I clung to my prize, and secured a very good chunk of\r\nwood while outside with it. The wood was very much needed by my mess,\r\nas our squad had then had none for more than a week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF THE 22D OF JULY--THE ARMS OF THE TENNESSEE ASSAULTED\r\nFRONT AND REAR--DEATH OF GENERAL MCPHERSON--ASSUMPTION OF COMMAND BY\r\nGENERAL LOGAN--RESULT OF THE BATTLE.\r\n\r\nNaturally, we had a consuming hunger for news of what was being\r\naccomplished by our armies toward crushing the Rebellion. Now, more\r\nthan ever, had we reason to ardently wish for the destruction of the\r\nRebel power. Before capture we had love of country and a natural desire\r\nfor the triumph of her flag to animate us. Now we had a hatred of the\r\nRebels that passed expression, and a fierce longing to see those who\r\ndaily tortured and insulted us trampled down in the dust of humiliation.\r\n\r\nThe daily arrival of prisoners kept us tolerably well\r\ninformed as to the general progress of the campaign, and we\r\nadded to the information thus obtained by getting--almost\r\ndaily--in some manner or another--a copy of a Rebel paper.\r\nMost frequently these were Atlanta papers, or an issue of the\r\n“Memphis-Corinth-Jackson-Grenada-Chattanooga-Resacca-Marietta-Atlanta\r\nAppeal,” as they used to facetiously term a Memphis paper that left\r\nthat City when it was taken in 1862, and for two years fell back from\r\nplace to place, as Sherman’s Army advanced, until at last it gave up\r\nthe struggle in September, 1864, in a little Town south of Atlanta,\r\nafter about two thousand miles of weary retreat from an indefatigable\r\npursuer. The papers were brought in by “fresh fish,” purchased from\r\nthe guards at from fifty cents to one dollar apiece, or occasionally\r\nthrown in to us when they had some specially disagreeable intelligence,\r\nlike the defeat of Banks, or Sturgis, or Bunter, to exult over. I was\r\nparticularly fortunate in getting hold of these. Becoming installed as\r\ngeneral reader for a neighborhood of several thousand men, everything\r\nof this kind was immediately brought to me, to be read aloud for the\r\nbenefit of everybody. All the older prisoners knew me by the nick-name\r\nof “Illinoy” --a designation arising from my wearing on my cap, when\r\nI entered prison, a neat little white metal badge of “ILLS.” When any\r\nreading matter was brought into our neighborhood, there would be a\r\ngeneral cry of:\r\n\r\n“Take it up to ‘Illinoy,’” and then hundreds would mass around my\r\nquarters to bear the news read.\r\n\r\nThe Rebel papers usually had very meager reports of the operations of\r\nthe armies, and these were greatly distorted, but they were still very\r\ninteresting, and as we always started in to read with the expectation\r\nthat the whole statement was a mass of perversions and lies, where\r\ntruth was an infrequent accident, we were not likely to be much\r\nimpressed with it.\r\n\r\nThere was a marled difference in the tone of the reports brought in\r\nfrom the different armies. Sherman’s men were always sanguine. They\r\nhad no doubt that they were pushing the enemy straight to the wall,\r\nand that every day brought the Southern Confederacy much nearer its\r\ndownfall. Those from the Army of the Potomac were never so hopeful.\r\nThey would admit that Grant was pounding Lee terribly, but the shadow\r\nof the frequent defeats of the Army of the Potomac seemed to hang\r\ndepressingly over them.\r\n\r\nThere came a day, however, when our sanguine hopes as to Sherman were\r\nchecked by a possibility that he had failed; that his long campaign\r\ntowards Atlanta had culminated in such a reverse under the very walls\r\nof the City as would compel an abandonment of the enterprise, and\r\npossibly a humiliating retreat. We knew that Jeff. Davis and his\r\nGovernment were strongly dissatisfied with the Fabian policy of Joe\r\nJohnston. The papers had told us of the Rebel President’s visit to\r\nAtlanta, of his bitter comments on Johnston’s tactics; of his going so\r\nfar as to sneer about the necessity of providing pontoons at Key West,\r\nso that Johnston might continue his retreat even to Cuba. Then came the\r\nnews of Johnston’s Supersession by Hood, and the papers were full of\r\nthe exulting predictions of what would now be accomplished “when that\r\ngallant young soldier is once fairly in the saddle.”\r\n\r\nAll this meant one supreme effort to arrest the onward course of\r\nSherman. It indicated a resolve to stake the fate of Atlanta, and\r\nthe fortunes of the Confederacy in the West, upon the hazard of one\r\ndesperate fight. We watched the summoning up of every Rebel energy for\r\nthe blow with apprehension. We dreaded another Chickamauga.\r\n\r\nThe blow fell on the 22d of July. It was well planned. The Army of\r\nthe Tennessee, the left of Sherman’s forces, was the part struck.\r\nOn the night of the 21st Hood marched a heavy force around its left\r\nflank and gained its rear. On the 22d this force fell on the rear with\r\nthe impetuous violence of a cyclone, while the Rebels in the works\r\nimmediately around Atlanta attacked furiously in front.\r\n\r\nIt was an ordeal that no other army ever passed through successfully.\r\nThe steadiest troops in Europe would think it foolhardiness to attempt\r\nto withstand an assault in force in front and rear at the same time.\r\nThe finest legions that follow any flag to-day must almost inevitably\r\nsuccumb to such a mode of attack. But the seasoned veterans of the\r\nArmy of the Tennessee encountered the shock with an obstinacy which\r\nshowed that the finest material for soldiery this planet holds was that\r\nin which undaunted hearts beat beneath blue blouses. Springing over\r\nthe front of their breastworks, they drove back with a withering fire\r\nthe force assailing them in the rear. This beaten off, they jumped\r\nback to their proper places, and repulsed the assault in front. This\r\nwas the way the battle was waged until night compelled a cessation of\r\noperations. Our boys were alternately behind the breastworks firing at\r\nRebels advancing upon the front, and in front of the works firing upon\r\nthose coming up in the rear. Sometimes part of our line would be on one\r\nside of the works, and part on the other.\r\n\r\nIn the prison we were greatly excited over the result of the\r\nengagement, of which we were uncertain for many days. A host of new\r\nprisoners perhaps two thousand--was brought in from there, but as they\r\nwere captured during the progress of the fight, they could not speak\r\ndefinitely as to its issue. The Rebel papers exulted without stint\r\nover what they termed “a glorious victory.” They were particularly\r\njubilant over the death of McPherson, who, they claimed, was the brain\r\nand guiding hand of Sherman’s army. One paper likened him to the\r\npilot-fish, which guides the shark to his prey. Now that he was gone,\r\nsaid the paper, Sherman’s army becomes a great lumbering hulk, with no\r\none in it capable of directing it, and it must soon fall to utter ruin\r\nunder the skilfully delivered strokes of the gallant Hood.\r\n\r\nWe also knew that great numbers of wounded had been brought to the\r\nprison hospital, and this seemed to confirm the Rebel claim of a\r\nvictory, as it showed they retained possession of the battle field.\r\n\r\nAbout the 1st of August a large squad of Sherman’s men, captured in one\r\nof the engagements subsequent to the 22d, came in. We gathered around\r\nthem eagerly. Among them I noticed a bright, curly-haired, blue-eyed\r\ninfantryman--or boy, rather, as he was yet beardless. His cap was\r\nmarked “68th O. Y. Y. L,” his sleeves were garnished with re-enlistment\r\nstripes, and on the breast of his blouse was a silver arrow. To the\r\neye of the soldier this said that he was a veteran member of the\r\nSixty-Eighth Regiment of Ohio Infantry (that is, having already served\r\nthree years, he had re-enlisted for the war), and that he belonged\r\nto the Third Division of the Seventeenth Army Corps. He was so young\r\nand fresh looking that one could hardly believe him to be a veteran,\r\nbut if his stripes had not said this, the soldierly arrangement of\r\nclothing and accouterments, and the graceful, self-possessed pose of\r\nlimbs and body would have told the observer that he was one of those\r\n“Old Reliables” with whom Sherman and Grant had already subdued a third\r\nof the Confederacy. His blanket, which, for a wonder, the Rebels had\r\nneglected to take from him, was tightly rolled, its ends tied together,\r\nand thrown over his shoulder scarf-fashion. His pantaloons were tucked\r\ninside his stocking tops, that were pulled up as far as possible,\r\nand tied tightly around his ankle with a string. A none-too-clean\r\nhaversack, containing the inevitable sooty quart cup, and even blacker\r\nhalf-canteen, waft slung easily from the shoulder opposite to that on\r\nwhich the blanket rested. Hand him his faithful Springfield rifle, put\r\nthree days’ rations in his haversack, and forty rounds in his cartridge\r\nbog, and he would be ready, without an instant’s demur or question,\r\nto march to the ends of the earth, and fight anything that crossed\r\nhis path. He was a type of the honest, honorable, self respecting\r\nAmerican boy, who, as a soldier, the world has not equaled in the sixty\r\ncenturies that war has been a profession. I suggested to him that he\r\nwas rather a youngster to be wearing veteran chevrons. “Yes,” said he,\r\n“I am not so old as some of the rest of the boys, but I have seen about\r\nas much service and been in the business about as long as any of them.\r\nThey call me ‘Old Dad,’ I suppose because I was the youngest boy in the\r\nRegiment, when we first entered the service, though our whole Company,\r\nofficers and all, were only a lot of boys, and the Regiment to day,\r\nwhat’s left of ’em, are about as young a lot of officers and men as\r\nthere are in the service. Why, our old Colonel ain’t only twenty-four\r\nyears old now, and he has been in command ever since we went into\r\nVicksburg. I have heard it said by our boys that since we veteranized\r\nthe whole Regiment, officers, and men, average less than twenty-four\r\nyears old. But they are gray-hounds to march and stayers in a fight,\r\nyou bet. Why, the rest of the troops over in West Tennessee used to\r\ncall our Brigade ‘Leggett’s Cavalry,’ for they always had us chasing\r\nOld Forrest, and we kept him skedaddling, too, pretty lively. But I\r\ntell you we did get into a red hot scrimmage on the 22d. It just laid\r\nover Champion Hills, or any of the big fights around Vicksburg, and\r\nthey were lively enough to amuse any one.”\r\n\r\n“So you were in the affair on the 22d, were you! We are awful anxious\r\nto hear all about it. Come over here to my quarters and tell us all you\r\nknow. All we know is that there has been a big fight, with McPherson\r\nkilled, and a heavy loss of life besides, and the Rebels claim a great\r\nvictory.”\r\n\r\n“O, they be -----. It was the sickest victory they ever got. About one\r\nmore victory of that kind would make their infernal old Confederacy\r\nready for a coroner’s inquest. Well, I can tell you pretty much all\r\nabout that fight, for I reckon if the truth was known, our regiment\r\nfired about the first and last shot that opened and closed the fighting\r\non that day. Well, you see the whole Army got across the river, and\r\nwere closing in around the City of Atlanta. Our Corps, the Seventeenth,\r\nwas the extreme left of the army, and were moving up toward the City\r\nfrom the East. The Fifteenth (Logan’s) Corps joined us on the right,\r\nthen the Army of the Cumberland further to the right. We run onto the\r\nRebs about sundown the 21st. They had some breastworks on a ridge in\r\nfront of us, and we had a pretty sharp fight before we drove them\r\noff. We went right to work, and kept at it all night in changing and\r\nstrengthening the old Rebel barricades, fronting them towards Atlanta,\r\nand by morning had some good solid works along our whole line. During\r\nthe night we fancied we could hear wagons or artillery moving away in\r\nfront of us, apparently going South, or towards our left. About three\r\nor four o’clock in the morning, while I was shoveling dirt like a\r\nbeaver out on the works, the Lieutenant came to me and said the Colonel\r\nwanted to see me, pointing to a large tree in the rear, where I could\r\nfind him. I reported and found him with General Leggett, who commanded\r\nour Division, talking mighty serious, and Bob Wheeler, of F Company,\r\nstanding there with his Springfield at a parade rest. As soon as I came\r\nup, the Colonel says:\r\n\r\n“Boys, the General wants two level-headed chaps to go out beyond the\r\npickets to the front and toward the left. I have selected you for the\r\nduty. Go as quietly as possible and as fast as you can; keep your eyes\r\nand ears open; don’t fire a shot if you can help it, and come back and\r\ntell us exactly what you have seen and heard, and not what you imagine\r\nor suspect. I have selected you for the duty.’\r\n\r\n“He gave us the countersign, and off we started over the breastworks\r\nand through the thick woods. We soon came to our skirmish or pickets,\r\nonly a few rods in front of our works, and cautioned them not to fire\r\non us in going or returning. We went out as much as half a mile or\r\nmore, until we could plainly hear the sound of wagons and artillery.\r\nWe then cautiously crept forward until we could see the main road\r\nleading south from the City filled with marching men, artillery and\r\nteams. We could hear the commands of the officers and see the flags\r\nand banners of regiment after regiment as they passed us. We got back\r\nquietly and quickly, passed through our picket line all right, and\r\nfound the General and our Colonel sitting on a log where we had left\r\nthem, waiting for us. We reported what we had seen and heard, and\r\ngave it as our opinion that the Johnnies were evacuating Atlanta. The\r\nGeneral shook his head, and the Colonel says: ‘You may return to your\r\ncompany.’ Bob says to me:\r\n\r\n“‘The old General shakes his head as though he thought them d---d Rebs\r\nain’t evacuating Atlanta so mighty sudden, but are up to some devilment\r\nagain. I ain’t sure but he’s right. They ain’t going to keep falling\r\nback and falling back to all eternity, but are just agoin’ to give us\r\na rip-roaring great big fight one o’ these days--when they get a good\r\nready. You hear me!’\r\n\r\n“Saying which we both went to our companies, and laid down to get a\r\nlittle sleep. It was about daylight then, and I must have snoozed\r\naway until near noon, when I heard the order ‘fall in!’ and found the\r\nregiment getting into line, and the boys all tallying about going right\r\ninto Atlanta; that the Rebels had evacuated the City during the night,\r\nand that we were going to have a race with the Fifteenth Corps as to\r\nwhich would get into the City first. We could look away out across a\r\nlarge field in front of our works, and see the skirmish line advancing\r\nsteadily towards the main works around the City. Not a shot was being,\r\nfired on either side.\r\n\r\n“To our surprise, instead of marching to the front and toward the\r\nCity, we filed off into a small road cut through the woods and marched\r\nrapidly to the rear. We could not understand what it meant. We marched\r\nat quick time, feeling pretty mad that we had to go to the rear, when\r\nthe rest of our Division were going into Atlanta.\r\n\r\n“We passed the Sixteenth Corps lying on their arms, back in some open\r\nfields, and the wagon trains of our Corps all comfortably corralled,\r\nand finally found ourselves out by the Seventeenth Corps headquarters.\r\nTwo or three companies were sent out to picket several roads that\r\nseemed to cross at that point, as it was reported ‘Rebel Cavalry’ had\r\nbeen seen on these roads but a short time before, and this accounted\r\nfor our being rushed out in such a great hurry.\r\n\r\n“We had just stacked arms and were going to take a little rest after\r\nour rapid march, when several Rebel prisoners were brought in by some\r\nof the boys who had straggled a little. They found the Rebels on the\r\nroad we had just marched out on. Up to this time not a shot had been\r\nfired. All was quiet back at the main works we had just left, when\r\nsuddenly we saw several staff officers come tearing up to the Colonel,\r\nwho ordered us to ‘fall in!’ ‘Take aims!’ ‘about, face!’ The Lieutenant\r\nColonel dashed down one of the roads where one of the companies had\r\ngone out on picket. The Major and Adjutant galloped down the others. We\r\ndid not wait for them to come back, though, but moved right back on the\r\nroad we had just come out, in line of battle, our colors in the road,\r\nand our flanks in open timber. We soon reached a fence enclosing a\r\nlarge field, and there could see a line of Rebels moving by the flank,\r\nand forming, facing toward Atlanta, but to the left and in the rear of\r\nthe position occupied by our Corps. As soon as we reached the fence we\r\nfired a round or two into the backs of these gray coats, who broke into\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\n“Just then the other companies joined us, and we moved off on ‘double\r\nquick by the right flank,’ for you see we were completely cut off from\r\nthe troops up at the front, and we had to get well over to the right\r\nto get around the flank of the Rebels. Just about the time we fired on\r\nthe rebels the Sixteenth Corps opened up a hot fire of musketry and\r\nartillery on them, some of their shot coming over mighty close to where\r\nwe were. We marched pretty fast, and finally turned in through some\r\nopen fields to the left, and came out just in the rear of the Sixteenth\r\nCorps, who were fighting like devils along their whole line.\r\n\r\n“Just as we came out into the open field we saw General R. K. Scott,\r\nwho used to be our Colonel, and who commanded our brigade, come\r\ntearing toward us with one or two aids or orderlies. He was on his\r\nbig clay-bank horse, ‘Old Hatchie,’ as we called him, as we captured\r\nhim on the battlefield at the battle of ‘Matamora,’ or ‘Hell on the\r\nHatchie,’ as our boys always called it. He rode up to the Colonel, said\r\nsomething hastily, when all at once we heard the all-firedest crash of\r\nmusketry and artillery way up at the front where we had built the works\r\nthe night before and left the rest of our brigade and Division getting\r\nready to prance into Atlanta when we were sent off to the rear. Scott\r\nput spurs to his old horse, who was one of the fastest runners in our\r\nDivision, and away he went back towards the position where his brigade\r\nand the troops immediately to their left were now hotly engaged. He\r\nrode right along in rear of the Sixteenth Corps, paying no attention\r\napparently to the shot and shell and bullets that were tearing up\r\nthe earth and exploding and striking all around him. His aids and\r\norderlies vainly tried to keep up with him. We could plainly see the\r\nRebel lines as they came out of the woods into the open grounds to\r\nattack the Sixteenth Corps, which had hastily formed in the open field,\r\nwithout any signs of works, and were standing up like men, having a\r\nhand-to-hand fight. We were just far enough in the rear so that every\r\nblasted shot or shell that was fired too high to hit the ranks of the\r\nSixteenth Corps came rattling over amongst us. All this time we were\r\nmarching fast, following in the direction General Scott had taken, who\r\nevidently had ordered the Colonel to join his brigade up at the front.\r\nWe were down under the crest of a little hill, following along the bank\r\nof a little creek, keeping under cover of the bank as much as possible\r\nto protect us from the shots of the enemy. We suddenly saw General\r\nLogan and one or two of his staff upon the right bank of the ravine\r\nriding rapidly toward us. As he neared the head of the regiment he\r\nshouted:\r\n\r\n“‘Halt! What regiment is that, and where are you going?’” The Colonel,\r\nin a loud voice, that all could hear, told him: “The Sixty-Eighth Ohio;\r\ngoing to join our brigade of the Third Division--your old Division,\r\nGeneral, of the Seventeenth Corps.”\r\n\r\n“Logan says, ‘you had better go right in here on the left of Dodge. The\r\nThird Division have hardly ground enough left now to bury their dead.\r\nGod knows they need you. But try it on, if you think you can get to\r\nthem.’\r\n\r\n“Just at this moment a staff officer came riding up on the opposite\r\nside of the ravine from where Logan was and interrupted Logan, who was\r\nabout telling the Colonel not to try to go to the position held by the\r\nThird Division by the road cut through the woods whence we had come\r\nout, but to keep off to the right towards the Fifteenth Corps, as the\r\nwoods referred to were full of Rebels. The officer saluted Logan, and\r\nshouted across:\r\n\r\n“General Sherman directs me to inform you of the death of General\r\nMcPherson, and orders you to take command of the Army of the Tennessee;\r\nhave Dodge close well up to the Seventeenth Corps, and Sherman will\r\nreinforce you to the extent of the whole army.’\r\n\r\n“Logan, standing in his stirrups, on his beautiful black horse, formed\r\na picture against the blue sky as we looked up the ravine at him, his\r\nblack eyes fairly blazing and his long black hair waving in the wind.\r\nHe replied in a ringing, clear tone that we all could hear:\r\n\r\n“Say to General Sherman I have heard of McPherson’s death, and have\r\nassumed the command of the Army of the Tennessee, and have already\r\nanticipated his orders in regard to closing the gap between Dodge and\r\nthe Seventeenth Corps.’\r\n\r\n“This, of course, all happened in one quarter of the time I have been\r\ntelling you. Logan put spurs to his horse and rode in one direction,\r\nthe staff officer of General Sherman in another, and we started on\r\na rapid step toward the front. This was the first we had heard of\r\nMcPherson’s death, and it made us feel very bad. Some of the officers\r\nand men cried as though they had lost a brother; others pressed their\r\nlips, gritted their teeth, and swore to avenge his death. He was a\r\ngreat favorite with all his Army, particularly of our Corps, which he\r\ncommanded for a long while. Our company, especially, knew him well,\r\nand loved him dearly, for we had been his Headquarters Guard for over\r\na year. As we marched along, toward the front, we could see brigades,\r\nand regiments, and batteries of artillery; coming over from the right\r\nof the Army, and taking position in new lines in rear of the Sixteenth\r\nand Seventeenth Corps. Major Generals and their staffs, Brigadier\r\nGenerals and their staffs, were mighty thick along the banks of the\r\nlittle ravine we were following; stragglers and wounded men by the\r\nhundred were pouring in to the safe shelter formed by the broken ground\r\nalong which we were rapidly marching; stories were heard of divisions,\r\nbrigades and regiments that these wounded or stragglers belonged,\r\nhaving been all cut to pieces; officers all killed; and the speaker,\r\nthe only one of his command not killed, wounded or captured. But you\r\nboys have heard and seen the same cowardly sneaks, probably, in fights\r\nthat you were in. The battle raged furiously all this time; part of the\r\ntime the Sixteenth Corps seemed to be in the worst; then it would let\r\nup on them and the Seventeenth Corps would be hotly engaged along their\r\nwhole front.\r\n\r\n“We had probably marched half an hour since leaving Logan, and were\r\ngetting pretty near back to our main line of works, when the Colonel\r\nordered a halt and knapsacks to be unslung and piled up. I tell you it\r\nwas a relief to get them off, for it was a fearful hot day, and we had\r\nbeen marching almost double quick. We knew that this meant business\r\nthough, and that we were stripping for the fight, which we would soon\r\nbe in. Just at this moment we saw an ambulance, with the horses on a\r\ndead run, followed by two or three mounted officers and men, coming\r\nright towards us out of the very woods Logan had cautioned the Colonel\r\nto avoid. When the ambulance got to where we were it halted. It was\r\npretty well out of danger from the bullets and shell of the enemy.\r\nThey stopped, and we recognized Major Strong, of McPherson’s Staff,\r\nwhom the all knew, as he was the Chief Inspector of our Corps, and\r\nin the ambulance he had the body of General McPherson. Major Strong,\r\nit appears, during a slight lull in the fighting at that part of the\r\nline, having taken an ambulance and driven into the very jaws of death\r\nto recover the remains of his loved commander. It seems he found the\r\nbody right by the side of the little road that we had gone out on when\r\nwe went to the rear. He was dead when he found him, having been shot\r\noff his horse, the bullet striking him in the back, just below his\r\nheart, probably killing him instantly. There was a young fellow with\r\nhim who was wounded also, when Strong found them. He belonged to our\r\nFirst Division, and recognized General McPherson, and stood by him\r\nuntil Major Strong came up. He was in the ambulance with the body of\r\nMcPherson when they stopped by us.\r\n\r\n“It seems that when the fight opened away back in the rear where we\r\nhad been, and at the left of the Sixteenth Corps which was almost\r\ndirectly in the rear of the Seventeenth Corps, McPherson sent his\r\nstaff and orderlies with various orders to different parts of the\r\nline, and started himself to ride over from the Seventeenth Corps to\r\nthe Sixteenth Corps, taking exactly the same course our Regiment had,\r\nperhaps an hour before, but the Rebels had discovered there was a gap\r\nbetween the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Corps, and meeting no opposition\r\nto their advances in this strip of woods, where they were hidden from\r\nview, they had marched right along down in the rear, and with their\r\nline at right angles with the line of works occupied by the left of\r\nthe Seventeenth Corps; they were thus parallel and close to the little\r\nroad McPherson had taken, and probably he rode right into them and was\r\nkilled before he realized the true situation.\r\n\r\n“Having piled our knapsacks, and left a couple of our older men, who\r\nwere played out with the heat and most ready to drop with sunstroke, to\r\nguard them, we started on again. The ambulance with the corpse of Gen.\r\nMcPherson moved off towards the right of the Army, which was the last\r\nwe ever saw of that brave and handsome soldier.\r\n\r\n“We bore off a little to the right of a large open field on top of a\r\nhigh hill where one of our batteries was pounding away at a tremendous\r\nrate. We came up to the main line of works just about at the left of\r\nthe Fifteenth Corps. They seemed to be having an easy time of it just\r\nthen --no fighting going on in their front, except occasional shots\r\nfrom some heavy guns on the main line of Rebel works around the City.\r\nWe crossed right over the Fifteenth Corps’ works and filed to the left,\r\nkeeping along on the outside of our works. We had not gone far before\r\nthe Rebel gunners in the main works around the City discovered us; and\r\nthe way they did tear loose at us was a caution. Their aim was rather\r\nbad, however, and most of their shots went over us. We saw one of\r\nthem--I think it was a shell--strike an artillery caisson belonging to\r\none of our-batteries. It exploded as it struck, and then the caisson,\r\nwhich was full of ammunition, exploded with an awful noise, throwing\r\npieces of wood and iron and its own load of shot and shell high into\r\nthe air, scattering death and destruction to the men and horses\r\nattached to it. We thought we saw arms and legs and parts of bodies of\r\nmen flying in every direction; but we were glad to learn afterwards\r\nthat it was the contents of the knapsacks of the Battery boys, who had\r\nstrapped them on the caissons for transportation.\r\n\r\n“Just after passing the hill where our battery was making things so\r\nlively, they stopped firing to let us pass. We saw General Leggett,\r\nour Division Commander, come riding toward us. He was outside of our\r\nline of works, too. You know how we build breastworks--sort of zigzag\r\nlike, you know, so they cannot be enfiladed. Well, that’s just the way\r\nthe works were along there, and you never saw such a curious shape\r\nas we formed our Division in. Why, part of them were on one side of\r\nthe works, and go along a little further and here was a regiment, or\r\npart of a regiment on the other side, both sets firing in opposite\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\n“No sir’ee, they were not demoralized or in confusion, they were cool\r\nand as steady as on parade. But the old Division had, you know, never\r\nbeen driven from any position they had once taken, in all their long\r\nservice, and they did not propose to leave that ridge until they got\r\norders from some one beside the Rebs.\r\n\r\n“There were times when a fellow did not know which side of the works\r\nwas the safest, for the Johnnies were in front of us and in rear of us.\r\nYou see, our Fourth Division, which had been to the left of us, had\r\nbeen forced to quit their works, when the Rebs got into the works in\r\ntheir rear, so that our Division was now at the point where our line\r\nturned sharply to the left, and rear--in the direction of the Sixteenth\r\nCorps.\r\n\r\n“We got into business before we had been there over three minutes. A\r\nline of the Rebs tried to charge across the open fields in front of\r\nus, but by the help of the old twenty-four pounders (which proved to\r\nbe part of Cooper’s Illinois Battery, that we had been alongside of in\r\nmany a hard fight before), we drove them back a-flying, only to have to\r\njump over on the outside of our works the next minute to tackle a heavy\r\nforce that came for our rear through that blasted strip of woods. We\r\nsoon drove them off, and the firing on both sides seemed to have pretty\r\nmuch stopped.\r\n\r\n“‘Our Brigade,’ which we discovered, was now commanded by ‘Old\r\nWhiskers’ (Colonel Piles, of the Seventy-Eighth Ohio. I’ll bet he’s\r\ngot the longest whiskers of any man in the Army.) You see General\r\nScott had not been seen or heard of since he had started to the rear\r\nafter our regiment when the fighting first commenced. We all believed\r\nthat he was either killed or captured, or he would have been with his\r\ncommand. He was a splendid soldier, and a bull-dog of a fighter. His\r\nabsence was a great loss, but we had not much time to think of such\r\nthings, for our brigade was then ordered to leave the works and to move\r\nto the right about twenty or thirty rods across a large ravine, where\r\nwe were placed in position in an open corn-field, forming a new line\r\nat quite an angle from the line of works we had just left, extending\r\nto the left, and getting us back nearer onto a line with the Sixteenth\r\nCorps. The battery of howitzers, now reinforced by a part of the Third\r\nOhio heavy guns, still occupied the old works on the highest part of\r\nthe hill, just to the right of our new line. We took our position just\r\non the brow of a hill, and were ordered to lie down, and the rear rank\r\nto go for rails, which we discovered a few rods behind us in the shape\r\nof a good ten-rail fence. Every rear-rank chap came back with all the\r\nrails he could lug, and we barely had time to lay them down in front\r\nof us, forming a little barricade of six to eight or ten inches high,\r\nwhen we heard the most unearthly Rebel yell directly in front of us.\r\nIt grew louder and came nearer and nearer, until we could see a solid\r\nline of the gray coats coming out of the woods and down the opposite\r\nslope, their battle flags flying, officers in front with drawn swords,\r\narms at right shoulder, and every one of them yelling like so many\r\nSioux Indians. The line seemed to be massed six or eight ranks deep,\r\nfollowed closely by the second line, and that by the third, each, if\r\npossible, yelling louder and appearing more desperately reckless than\r\nthe one ahead. At their first appearance we opened on them, and so did\r\nthe bully old twenty-four-pounders, with canister.\r\n\r\n“On they came; the first line staggered and wavered back on to the\r\nsecond, which was coming on the double quick. Such a raking as we did\r\ngive them. Oh, Lordy, how we did wish that we had the breech loading\r\nSpencers or Winchesters. But we had the old reliable Springfields,\r\nand we poured it in hot and heavy. By the time the charging column\r\ngot down the opposite slope, and were struggling through the thicket\r\nof undergrowth in the ravine, they were one confused mass of officers\r\nand men, the three lines now forming one solid column, which made\r\nseveral desperate efforts to rush up to the top of the hill where we\r\nwere punishing them so. One of their first surges came mighty near\r\ngoing right over the left of our Regiment, as they were lying down\r\nbehind their little rail piles. But the boys clubbed their guns and the\r\nofficers used their revolvers and swords and drove them back down the\r\nhill.\r\n\r\n“The Seventy-Eighth and Twentieth Ohio, our right and left bowers, who\r\nhad been brigaded with us ever since ‘Shiloh,’ were into it as hot and\r\nheavy as we had been, and had lost numbers of their officers and men,\r\nbut were hanging on to their little rail piles when the fight was over.\r\nAt one time the Rebs were right in on top of the Seventy-Eighth. One\r\nbig Reb grabbed their colors, and tried to pull them out of the hands\r\nof the color-bearer. But old Captain Orr, a little, short, dried-up\r\nfellow, about sixty years old, struck him with his sword across the\r\nback of the neck, and killed him deader than a mackerel, right in his\r\ntracks.\r\n\r\n“It was now getting dark, and the Johnnies concluded they had taken a\r\nbigger contract in trying to drive us off that hill in one day than\r\nthey had counted on, so they quit charging on us, but drew back under\r\ncover of the woods and along the old line of works that we had left,\r\nand kept up a pecking away and sharp-shooting at us all night long.\r\nThey opened fire on us from a number of pieces of artillery from the\r\nfront, from the left, and from some heavy guns away over to the right\r\nof us, in the main works around Atlanta.\r\n\r\n“We did not fool away much time that night, either. We got our shovels\r\nand picks, and while part of us were sharpshooting and trying to keep\r\nthe Rebels from working up too close to us, the rest of the boys were\r\nputting up some good solid earthworks right where our rail piles had\r\nbeen, and by morning we were in splendid shape to have received our\r\nfriends, no matter which way they had come at us, for they kept up such\r\nan all-fired shelling of us from so many different directions; that the\r\nboys had built traverses and bomb-proofs at all sorts of angles and in\r\nall directions.\r\n\r\n“There was one point off to our right, a few rods up along our old line\r\nof works where there was a crowd of Rebel sharpshooters that annoyed\r\nus more than all the rest, by their constant firing at us through the\r\nnight. They killed one of Company H’s boys, and wounded several others.\r\nFinally Captain Williams, of D Company, came along and said he wanted\r\na couple of good shots out of our company to go with him, so I went\r\nfor one. He took about ten of us, and we crawled down into the ravine\r\nin front of where we were building the works, and got behind a large\r\nfallen tree, and we laid there and could just fire right up into the\r\nrear of those fellows as they lay behind a traverse extending back\r\nfrom our old line of works. It was so dark we could only see where to\r\nfire by the flash of guns, but every time they would shoot, some of us\r\nwould let them have one. They staid there until almost daylight, when\r\nthey, concluded as things looked, since we were going to stay, they had\r\nbetter be going.\r\n\r\n“It was an awful night. Down in the ravine below us lay hundreds of\r\nkilled and wounded Rebels, groaning and crying aloud for water and for\r\nhelp. We did do what we could for those right around us--but it was\r\nso dark, and so many shell bursting and bullets flying around that a\r\nfellow could not get about much. I tell you it was pretty tough next\r\nmorning to go along to the different companies of our regiment and\r\nhear who were among the killed and wounded, and to see the long row\r\nof graves that were being dug to bury our comrades and our officers.\r\nThere was the Captain of Company E, Nelson Skeeles, of Fulton County,\r\nO., one of--the bravest and best officers in the regiment. By his\r\nside lay First Sergeant Lesnit, and next were the two great, powerful\r\nShepherds--cousins but more like brothers. One, it seems, was killed\r\nwhile supporting the head of the other, who had just received a death\r\nwound, thus dying in each other’s arms.\r\n\r\n“But I can’t begin to think or tell you the names of all the poor boys\r\nthat we laid away to rest in their last, long sleep on that gloomy day.\r\nOur Major was severely wounded, and several other officers had been hit\r\nmore or less badly.\r\n\r\n“It was a frightful sight, though, to go over the field in front of\r\nour works on that morning. The Rebel dead and badly wounded laid where\r\nthey had fallen. The bottom and opposite side of the ravine showed\r\nhow destructive our fire and that of the canister from the howitzers\r\nhad been. The underbrush was cut, slashed, and torn into shreds, and\r\nthe larger trees were scarred, bruised and broken by the thousands of\r\nbullets and other missiles that had been poured into them from almost\r\nevery conceivable direction during the day before.\r\n\r\n“A lot of us boys went way over to the left into Fuller’s Division of\r\nthe Sixteenth Corps, to see how some of our boys over there had got\r\nthrough the scrimmage, for they had about as nasty a fight as any part\r\nof the Army, and if it had not been for their being just where they\r\nwere, I am not sure but what the old Seventeenth Corps would have had\r\na different story to tell now. We found our friends had been way out\r\nby Decatur, where their brigade had got into a pretty lively fight on\r\ntheir own hook.\r\n\r\n“We got back to camp, and the first thing I knew I was detailed for\r\npicket duty, and we were posted over a few rods across the ravine in\r\nour front. We had not been out but a short time when we saw a flag\r\nof truce, borne by an officer, coming towards us. We halted him, and\r\nmade him wait until a report was sent back to Corps headquarters. The\r\nRebel officer was quite chatty and talkative with our picket officer,\r\nwhile waiting. He said he was on General Cleburne’s staff, and that the\r\ntroops that charged us so fiercely the evening before was Cleburne’s\r\nwhole Division, and that after their last repulse, knowing the hill\r\nwhere we were posted was the most important position along our line,\r\nhe felt that if they would keep close to us during the night, and keep\r\nup a show of fight, that we would pull out and abandon the hill before\r\nmorning. He said that he, with about fifty of their best men, had\r\nvolunteered to keep up the demonstration, and it was his party that had\r\noccupied the traverse in our old works the night before and had annoyed\r\nus and the Battery men by their constant sharpshooting, which we\r\nfellows behind the old tree had finally tired out. He said they staid\r\nuntil almost daylight, and that he lost more than half his men before\r\nhe left. He also told us that General Scott was captured by their\r\nDivision, at about the time and almost the same spot as where General\r\nMcPherson was killed, and that he was not hurt or wounded, and was now\r\na prisoner in their hands.\r\n\r\n“Quite a lot of our staff officers soon came out, and as near as we\r\ncould learn the Rebels wanted a truce to bury their dead. Our folks\r\ntried to get up an exchange of prisoners that had been taken by both\r\nsides the day before, but for some reason they could not bring it\r\nabout. But the truce for burying the dead was agreed to. Along about\r\ndusk some of the boys on my post got to telling about a lot of silver\r\nand brass instruments that belonged to one of the bands of the Fourth\r\nDivision, which had been hung up in some small trees a little way over\r\nin front of where we were when the fight was going on the day before,\r\nand that when, a bullet would strike one of the horns they could hear\r\nit go ‘pin-g’ and in a few minutes ‘pan-g’ would go another bullet\r\nthrough one of them.\r\n\r\n“A new picket was just coming’ on, and I had picked up my blanket and\r\nhaversack, and was about ready to start back to camp, when, thinks I,\r\n‘I’ll just go out there and see about them horns.’ I told the boys what\r\nI was going to do. They all seemed to think it was safe enough, so out\r\nI started. I had not gone more than a hundred yards, I should think,\r\nwhen here I found the horns all hanging around on the trees just as the\r\nboys had described. Some of them had lots of bullet holes in them. But\r\nI saw a beautiful, nice looking silver bugle hanging off to one side a\r\nlittle. ‘I Thinks,’ says I, ‘I’ll just take that little toot horn in\r\nout of the wet, and take it back to camp.’ I was just reaching up after\r\nit when I heard some one say,\r\n\r\n“‘Halt!’ and I’ll be dog-Boned if there wasn’t two of the meanest\r\nlooking Rebels, standing not ten feet from me, with their guns cocked\r\nand pointed at me, and, of course, I knew I was a goner; they walked me\r\nback about one hundred and fifty yards, where their picket line was.\r\nFrom there I was kept going for an hour or two until we got over to\r\na place on the railroad called East Point. There I got in with a big\r\ncrowd of our prisoners, who were taken the day before, and we have been\r\nfooling along in a lot of old cattle cars getting down here ever since.\r\n\r\n“So this is ‘Andersonville,’ is it! Well, by ----!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nCLOTHING: ITS RAPID DETERIORATION, AND DEVICES TO REPLENISH\r\nIT--DESPERATE EFFORTS TO COVER NAKEDNESS--“LITTLE RED CAP” AND HIS\r\nLETTER.\r\n\r\nClothing had now become an object of real solicitude to us older\r\nprisoners. The veterans of our crowd--the surviving remnant of those\r\ncaptured at Gettysburg--had been prisoners over a year. The next in\r\nseniority--the Chickamauga boys--had been in ten months. The Mine Run\r\nfellows were eight months old, and my battalion had had seven months’\r\nincarceration. None of us were models of well-dressed gentlemen when\r\ncaptured. Our garments told the whole story of the hard campaigning we\r\nhad undergone. Now, with months of the wear and tear of prison life,\r\nsleeping on the sand, working in tunnels, digging wells, etc., we were\r\ntattered and torn to an extent that a second-class tramp would have\r\nconsidered disgraceful.\r\n\r\nThis is no reflection upon the quality of the clothes furnished by\r\nthe Government. We simply reached the limit of the wear of textile\r\nfabrics. I am particular to say this, because I want to contribute my\r\nlittle mite towards doing justice to a badly abused part of our Army\r\norganization --the Quartermaster’s Department. It is fashionable to\r\nspeak of “shoddy,” and utter some stereotyped sneers about “brown paper\r\nshoes,” and “musketo-netting overcoats,” when any discussion of the\r\nQuartermaster service is the subject of conversation, but I have no\r\nhesitation in asking the indorsement of my comrades to the statement\r\nthat we have never found anywhere else as durable garments as those\r\nfurnished us by the Government during our service in the Army. The\r\nclothes were not as fine in texture, nor so stylish in cut as those we\r\nwore before or since, but when it came to wear they could be relied on\r\nto the last thread. It was always marvelous to me that they lasted so\r\nwell, with the rough usage a soldier in the field must necessarily give\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBut to return to my subject. I can best illustrate the way our\r\nclothes dropped off us, piece by piece, like the petals from the last\r\nrose of Summer, by taking my own case as an example: When I entered\r\nprison I was clad in the ordinary garb of an enlisted man of the\r\ncavalry--stout, comfortable boots, woolen pocks, drawers, pantaloons,\r\nwith a “reenforcement,” or “ready-made patches,” as the infantry\r\ncalled them; vest, warm, snug-fitting jacket, under and over shirts,\r\nheavy overcoat, and a forage-cap. First my boots fell into cureless\r\nruin, but this was no special hardship, as the weather had become\r\nquite warm, and it was more pleasant than otherwise to go barefooted.\r\nThen part of the underclothing retired from service. The jacket and\r\nvest followed, their end being hastened by having their best portions\r\ntaken to patch up the pantaloons, which kept giving out at the most\r\nembarrassing places. Then the cape of the overcoat was called upon to\r\nassist in repairing these continually-recurring breaches in the nether\r\ngarments. The same insatiate demand finally consumed the whole coat, in\r\na vain attempt to prevent an exposure of person greater than consistent\r\nwith the usages of society. The pantaloons--or what, by courtesy, I\r\ncalled such, were a monument of careful and ingenious, but hopeless,\r\npatching, that should have called forth the admiration of a Florentine\r\nartist in mosaic. I have been shown--in later years--many table tops,\r\nornamented in marquetry, inlaid with thousands of little bits of wood,\r\ncunningly arranged, and patiently joined together. I always look at\r\nthem with interest, for I know the work spent upon them: I remember my\r\nAndersonville pantaloons.\r\n\r\nThe clothing upon the upper part of my body had been reduced to the\r\nremains of a knit undershirt. It had fallen into so many holes that it\r\nlooked like the coarse “riddles” through which ashes and gravel are\r\nsifted. Wherever these holes were the sun had burned my back, breast\r\nand shoulders deeply black. The parts covered by the threads and\r\nfragments forming the boundaries of the holes, were still white. When\r\nI pulled my alleged shirt off, to wash or to free it from some of its\r\nteeming population, my skin showed a fine lace pattern in black and\r\nwhite, that was very interesting to my comrades, and the subject of\r\ncountless jokes by them.\r\n\r\nThey used to descant loudly on the chaste elegance of the design, the\r\nrichness of the tracing, etc., and beg me to furnish them with a copy\r\nof it when I got home, for their sisters to work window curtains or\r\ntidies by. They were sure that so striking a novelty in patterns would\r\nbe very acceptable. I would reply to their witticisms in the language\r\nof Portia’s Prince of Morocco:\r\n\r\nMislike me not for my complexion-- The shadowed livery of the burning\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nOne of the stories told me in my childhood by an old negro nurse, was\r\nof a poverty stricken little girl “who slept on the floor and was\r\ncovered with the door,” and she once asked--\r\n\r\n“Mamma how do poor folks get along who haven’t any door?”\r\n\r\nIn the same spirit I used to wonder how poor fellows got along who\r\nhadn’t any shirt.\r\n\r\nOne common way of keeping up one’s clothing was by stealing mealsacks.\r\nThe meal furnished as rations was brought in in white cotton sacks.\r\nSergeants of detachments were required to return these when the\r\nrations were issued the next day. I have before alluded to the general\r\nincapacity of the Rebels to deal accurately with even simple numbers.\r\nIt was never very difficult for a shrewd Sergeant to make nine sacks\r\ncount as ten. After awhile the Rebels began to see through this sleight\r\nof hand manipulation, and to check it. Then the Sergeants resorted to\r\nthe device of tearing the sacks in two, and turning each half in as a\r\nwhole one. The cotton cloth gained in this way was used for patching,\r\nor, if a boy could succeed in beating the Rebels out of enough of\r\nit, he would fabricate himself a shirt or a pair of pantaloons. We\r\nobtained all our thread in the same way. A half of a sack, carefully\r\nraveled out, would furnish a couple of handfuls of thread. Had it not\r\nbeen for this resource all our sewing and mending would have come to a\r\nstandstill.\r\n\r\nMost of our needles were manufactured by ourselves from bones. A piece\r\nof bone, split as near as possible to the required size, was carefully\r\nrubbed down upon a brick, and then had an eye laboriously worked\r\nthrough it with a bit of wire or something else available for the\r\npurpose. The needles were about the size of ordinary darning needles,\r\nand answered the purpose very well.\r\n\r\nThese devices gave one some conception of the way savages provide for\r\nthe wants of their lives. Time was with them, as with us, of little\r\nimportance. It was no loss of time to them, nor to us, to spend a large\r\nportion of the waking hours of a week in fabricating a needle out of a\r\nbone, where a civilized man could purchase a much better one with the\r\nproduct of three minutes’ labor. I do not think any red Indian of the\r\nplains exceeded us in the patience with which we worked away at these\r\nminutia of life’s needs.\r\n\r\nOf course the most common source of clothing was the dead, and no body\r\nwas carried out with any clothing on it that could be of service to the\r\nsurvivors. The Plymouth Pilgrims, who were so well clothed on coming\r\nin, and were now dying off very rapidly, furnished many good suits to\r\ncover the nakedness of older, prisoners. Most of the prisoners from the\r\nArmy of the Potomac were well dressed, and as very many died within a\r\nmonth or six weeks after their entrance, they left their clothes in\r\npretty good condition for those who constituted themselves their heirs,\r\nadministrators and assigns.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I had the greatest aversion to wearing dead men’s\r\nclothes, and could only bring myself to it after I had been a year in\r\nprison, and it became a question between doing that and freezing to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nEvery new batch of prisoners was besieged with anxious inquiries on the\r\nsubject which lay closest to all our hearts:\r\n\r\n“What are they doing about exchange!”\r\n\r\nNothing in human experience--save the anxious expectancy of a sail by\r\ncastaways on a desert island--could equal the intense eagerness with\r\nwhich this question was asked, and the answer awaited. To thousands now\r\nhanging on the verge of eternity it meant life or death. Between the\r\nfirst day of July and the first of November over twelve thousand men\r\ndied, who would doubtless have lived had they been able to reach our\r\nlines--“get to God’s country,” as we expressed it.\r\n\r\nThe new comers brought little reliable news of contemplated exchange.\r\nThere was none to bring in the first place, and in the next, soldiers\r\nin active service in the field had other things to busy themselves\r\nwith than reading up the details of the negotiations between the\r\nCommissioners of Exchange. They had all heard rumors, however, and by\r\nthe time they reached Andersonville, they had crystallized these into\r\nactual statements of fact. A half hour after they entered the Stockade,\r\na report like this would spread like wildfire:\r\n\r\n“An Army of the Potomac man has just come in, who was captured in front\r\nof Petersburg. He says that he read in the New York Herald, the day\r\nbefore he was taken, that an exchange had been agreed upon, and that\r\nour ships had already started for Savannah to take us home.”\r\n\r\nThen our hopes would soar up like balloons. We fed ourselves on such\r\nstuff from day to day, and doubtless many lives were greatly prolonged\r\nby the continual encouragement. There was hardly a day when I did not\r\nsay to myself that I would much rather die than endure imprisonment\r\nanother month, and had I believed that another month would see me\r\nstill there, I am pretty certain that I should have ended the matter\r\nby crossing the Dead Line. I was firmly resolved not to die the\r\ndisgusting, agonizing death that so many around me were dying.\r\n\r\nOne of our best purveyors of information was a bright, blue-eyed,\r\nfair-haired little drummer boy, as handsome as a girl, well-bred as\r\na lady, and evidently the darling of some refined loving mother. He\r\nbelonged, I think, to some loyal Virginia regiment, was captured in\r\none of the actions in the Shenandoa Valley, and had been with us\r\nin Richmond. We called him “Red Cap,” from his wearing a jaunty,\r\ngold-laced, crimson cap. Ordinarily, the smaller a drummer boy is\r\nthe harder he is, but no amount of attrition with rough men could\r\ncoarse the ingrained refinement of Red Cap’s manners. He was between\r\nthirteen and fourteen, and it seemed utterly shameful that men, calling\r\nthemselves soldier should make war on such a tender boy and drag him\r\noff to prison.\r\n\r\nBut no six-footer had a more soldierly heart than little Red Cap, and\r\nnone were more loyal to the cause. It was a pleasure to hear him tell\r\nthe story of the fights and movements his regiment had been engaged\r\nin. He was a good observer and told his tale with boyish fervor.\r\nShortly after Wirz assumed command he took Red Cap into his office as\r\nan Orderly. His bright face and winning manner; fascinated the women\r\nvisitors at headquarters, and numbers of them tried to adopt him,\r\nbut with poor success. Like the rest of us, he could see few charms\r\nin an existence under the Rebel flag, and turned a deaf ear to their\r\nblandishments. He kept his ears open to the conversation of the Rebel\r\nofficers around him, and frequently secured permission to visit the\r\ninterior of the Stockade, when he would communicate to us all that he\r\nhas heard. He received a flattering reception every time he cams in,\r\nand no orator ever secured a more attentive audience than would gather\r\naround him to listen to what he had to say. He was, beyond a doubt, the\r\nbest known and most popular person in the prison, and I know all the\r\nsurvivors of his old admirer; share my great interest in him, and my\r\ncuriosity as to whether he yet lives, and whether his subsequent career\r\nhas justified the sanguine hopes we all had as to his future. I hope\r\nthat if he sees this, or any one who knows anything about him, he will\r\ncommunicate with me. There are thousands who will be glad to hear from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nA most remarkable coincidence occurred in regard to this comrade.\r\nSeveral days after the above had been written, and “set up,” but before\r\nit had yet appeared in the paper, I received the following letter:\r\n\r\n                                             ECKHART MINES,\r\n                              Alleghany County, Md., March 24.\r\n\r\nTo the Editor of the BLADE:\r\n\r\nLast evening I saw a copy of your paper, in which was a chapter or\r\ntwo of a prison life of a soldier during the late war. I was forcibly\r\nstruck with the correctness of what he wrote, and the names of several\r\nof my old comrades which he quoted: Hill, Limber Jim, etc., etc. I\r\nwas a drummer boy of Company I, Tenth West Virginia Infantry, and was\r\nfifteen years of age a day or two after arriving in Andersonville,\r\nwhich was in the last of February, 1884. Nineteen of my comrades were\r\nthere with me, and, poor fellows, they are there yet. I have no doubt\r\nthat I would have remained there, too, had I not been more fortunate.\r\n\r\nI do not know who your soldier correspondent is, but assume to say\r\nthat from the following description he will remember having seen me\r\nin Andersonville: I was the little boy that for three or four months\r\nofficiated as orderly for Captain Wirz. I wore a red cap, and every\r\nday could be seen riding Wirz’s gray mare, either at headquarters,\r\nor about the Stockade. I was acting in this capacity when the six\r\nraiders --“Mosby,” (proper name Collins) Delaney, Curtis, and--I forget\r\nthe other names--were executed. I believe that I was the first that\r\nconveyed the intelligence to them that Confederate General Winder had\r\napproved their sentence. As soon as Wirz received the dispatch to that\r\neffect, I ran down to the stocks and told them.\r\n\r\nI visited Hill, of Wauseon, Fulton County, O., since the war, and found\r\nhim hale and hearty. I have not heard from him for a number of years\r\nuntil reading your correspondent’s letter last evening. It is the only\r\nletter of the series that I have seen, but after reading that one, I\r\nfeel called upon to certify that I have no doubts of the truthfulness\r\nof your correspondent’s story. The world will never know or believe the\r\nhorrors of Andersonville and other prisons in the South. No living,\r\nhuman being, in my judgment, will ever be able to properly paint the\r\nhorrors of those infernal dens.\r\n\r\nI formed the acquaintance of several Ohio soldiers whilst in\r\nprison. Among these were O. D. Streeter, of Cleveland, who went to\r\nAndersonville about the same time that I did, and escaped, and was the\r\nonly man that I ever knew that escaped and reached our lines. After an\r\nabsence of several months he was retaken in one of Sherman’s battles\r\nbefore Atlanta, and brought back. I also knew John L. Richards, of\r\nFostoria, Seneca County, O. or Eaglesville, Wood County. Also, a man\r\nby the name of Beverly, who was a partner of Charley Aucklebv, of\r\nTennessee. I would like to hear from all of these parties. They all\r\nknow me.\r\n\r\nMr. Editor, I will close by wishing all my comrades who shared in the\r\nsufferings and dangers of Confederate prisons, a long and useful life.\r\n\r\n                                   Yours truly,\r\n                                                  RANSOM T. POWELL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nSOME FEATURES OF THE MORTALITY--PERCENTAGE OF DEATHS TO THOSE LIVING\r\n--AN AVERAGE MEAN ONLY STANDS THE MISERY THREE MONTHS--DESCRIPTION\r\nOF THE PRISON AND THE CONDITION OF THE MEN THEREIN, BY A LEADING\r\nSCIENTIFIC MAN OF THE SOUTH.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the manner in which the Plymouth Pilgrims were now dying,\r\nI am reminded of my theory that the ordinary man’s endurance of this\r\nprison life did not average over three months. The Plymouth boys\r\narrived in May; the bulk of those who died passed away in July and\r\nAugust. The great increase of prisoners from all sources was in May,\r\nJune and July. The greatest mortality among these was in August,\r\nSeptember and October.\r\n\r\nMany came in who had been in good health during their service in the\r\nfield, but who seemed utterly overwhelmed by the appalling misery they\r\nsaw on every hand, and giving way to despondency, died in a few days\r\nor weeks. I do not mean to include them in the above class, as their\r\nsickness was more mental than physical. My idea is that, taking one\r\nhundred ordinarily healthful young soldiers from a regiment in active\r\nservice, and putting them into Andersonville, by the end of the third\r\nmonth at least thirty-three of those weakest and most vulnerable to\r\ndisease would have succumbed to the exposure, the pollution of ground\r\nand air, and the insufficiency of the ration of coarse corn meal. After\r\nthis the mortality would be somewhat less, say at the end of six months\r\nfifty of them would be dead. The remainder would hang on still more\r\ntenaciously, and at the end of a year there would be fifteen or twenty\r\nstill alive. There were sixty-three of my company taken; thirteen\r\nlived through. I believe this was about the usual proportion for those\r\nwho were in as long as we. In all there were forty-five thousand six\r\nhundred and thirteen prisoners brought into Andersonville. Of these\r\ntwelve thousand nine hundred and twelve died there, to say nothing of\r\nthousands that died in other prisons in Georgia and the Carolinas,\r\nimmediately after their removal from Andersonville. One of every\r\nthree and a-half men upon whom the gates of the Stockade closed never\r\nrepassed them alive. Twenty-nine per cent. of the boys who so much as\r\nset foot in Andersonville died there. Let it be kept in mind all the\r\ntime, that the average stay of a prisoner there was not four months.\r\nThe great majority came in after the 1st of May, and left before the\r\nmiddle of September. May 1, 1864, there were ten thousand four hundred\r\nand twenty-seven in the Stockade. August 8 there were thirty-three\r\nthousand one hundred and fourteen; September 30 all these were dead\r\nor gone, except eight thousand two hundred and eighteen, of whom four\r\nthousand five hundred and ninety died inside of the next thirty days.\r\nThe records of the world can shove no parallel to this astounding\r\nmortality.\r\n\r\nSince the above matter was first published in the BLADE, a friend has\r\nsent me a transcript of the evidence at the Wirz trial, of Professor\r\nJoseph Jones, a Surgeon of high rank in the Rebel Army, and who\r\nstood at the head of the medical profession in Georgia. He visited\r\nAndersonville at the instance of the Surgeon-General of the Confederate\r\nStates’ Army, to make a study, for the benefit of science, of the\r\nphenomena of disease occurring there. His capacity and opportunities\r\nfor observation, and for clearly estimating the value of the facts\r\ncoming under his notice were, of course, vastly superior to mine,\r\nand as he states the case stronger than I dare to, for fear of being\r\naccused of exaggeration and downright untruth, I reproduce the major\r\npart of his testimony--embodying also his official report to medical\r\nheadquarters at Richmond--that my readers may know how the prison\r\nappeared to the eyes of one who, though a bitter Rebel, was still a\r\nhumane man and a conscientious observer, striving to learn the truth:\r\n\r\n                         MEDICAL TESTIMONY.\r\n\r\n[Transcript from the printed testimony at the Wirz Trial, pages 618 to\r\n639, inclusive.]\r\n\r\n                                             OCTOBER 7, 1885.\r\n\r\nDr. Joseph Jones, for the prosecution:\r\n\r\nBy the Judge Advocate:\r\n\r\nQuestion.

How were you employed during the Rebellion?\r\n\r\nA. I served six months in the early part of it as a private in the\r\nranks, and the rest of the time in the medical department.\r\n\r\nQ. Under the direction of whom?\r\n\r\nA. Under the direction of Dr. Moore, Surgeon General.\r\n\r\nQ. Did you, while acting under his direction, visit Andersonville,\r\nprofessionally?\r\n\r\nA. Yes, Sir.\r\n\r\nQ. For the purpose of making investigations there?\r\n\r\nA. For the purpose of prosecuting investigations ordered by the Surgeon\r\nGeneral.\r\n\r\nQ. You went there in obedience to a letter of instructions?\r\n\r\nA. In obedience to orders which I received.\r\n\r\nQ. Did you reduce the results of your investigations to the shape of a\r\nreport?\r\n\r\nA. I was engaged at that work when General Johnston surrendered his\r\narmy.\r\n\r\n(A document being handed to witness.)\r\n\r\nQ. Have you examined this extract from your report and compared it with\r\nthe original?\r\n\r\nA. Yes, Sir; I have.\r\n\r\nQ. Is it accurate?\r\n\r\nA. So far as my examination extended, it is accurate.’\r\n\r\nThe document just examined by witness was offered in evidence, and is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nObservations upon the diseases of the Federal prisoners, confined to\r\nCamp Sumter, Andersonville, in Sumter County, Georgia, instituted\r\nwith a view to illustrate chiefly the origin and causes of hospital\r\ngangrene, the relations of continued and malarial fevers, and the\r\npathology of camp diarrhea and dysentery, by Joseph Jones; Surgeon P.\r\nA. C. S., Professor of Medical Chemistry in the Medical College of\r\nGeorgia, at Augusta, Georgia.\r\n\r\n\r\nHearing of the unusual mortality among the Federal prisoners confined\r\nat Andersonville; Georgia, in the month of August, 1864, during a visit\r\nto Richmond, Va., I expressed to the Surgeon General, S. P. Moore,\r\nConfederate States of America, a desire to visit Camp Sumter, with\r\nthe design of instituting a series of inquiries upon the nature and\r\ncauses of the prevailing diseases. Smallpox had appeared among the\r\nprisoners, and I believed that this would prove an admirable field\r\nfor the establishment of its characteristic lesions. The condition\r\nof Peyer’s glands in this disease was considered as worthy of minute\r\ninvestigation. It was believed that a large body of men from the\r\nNorthern portion of the United States, suddenly transported to a warm\r\nSouthern climate, and confined upon a small portion of land, would\r\nfurnish an excellent field for the investigation of the relations of\r\ntyphus, typhoid, and malarial fevers.\r\n\r\nThe Surgeon General of the Confederate States of America furnished me\r\nwith the following letter of introduction to the Surgeon in charge of\r\nthe Confederate States Military Prison at Andersonville, Ga.:\r\n\r\n                              CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA,\r\n                              SURGEON GENERAL’S OFFICE, RICHMOND, VA.,\r\n                              August 6, 1864.\r\n\r\nSIR:--The field of pathological investigations afforded by the large\r\ncollection of Federal prisoners in Georgia, is of great extant and\r\nimportance, and it is believed that results of value to the profession\r\nmay be obtained by careful investigation of the effects of disease upon\r\nthe large body of men subjected to a decided change of climate and\r\nthose circumstances peculiar to prison life. The Surgeon in charge of\r\nthe hospital for Federal prisoners, together with his assistants, will\r\nafford every facility to Surgeon Joseph Jones, in the prosecution of\r\nthe labors ordered by the Surgeon General. Efficient assistance must\r\nbe rendered Surgeon Jones by the medical officers, not only in his\r\nexaminations into the causes and symptoms of the various diseases, but\r\nespecially in the arduous labors of post mortem examinations.\r\n\r\nThe medical officers will assist in the performance of such\r\npost-mortems as Surgeon Jones may indicate, in order that this great\r\nfield for pathological investigation may be explored for the benefit of\r\nthe Medical Department of the Confederate Army.\r\n\r\n                                        S. P. MOORE, Surgeon General.\r\nSurgeon ISAIAH H. WHITE,\r\n\r\n     In charge of Hospital for Federal prisoners, Andersonville, Ga.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn compliance with this letter of the Surgeon General, Isaiah H.\r\nWhite, Chief Surgeon of the post, and R. R. Stevenson, Surgeon in\r\ncharge of the Prison Hospital, afforded the necessary facilities for\r\nthe prosecution of my investigations among the sick outside of the\r\nStockade. After the completion of my labors in the military prison\r\nhospital, the following communication was addressed to Brigadier\r\nGeneral John H. Winder, in consequence of the refusal on the part of\r\nthe commandant of the interior of the Confederate States Military\r\nPrison to admit me within the Stockade upon the order of the Surgeon\r\nGeneral:\r\n\r\n                              CAMP SUMTER, ANDERSONVILLE GA.,\r\n                              September 16, 1864.\r\n\r\nGENERAL:--I respectfully request the commandant of the post of\r\nAndersonville to grant me permission and to furnish the necessary pass\r\nto visit the sick and medical officers within the Stockade of the\r\nConfederate States Prison. I desire to institute certain inquiries\r\nordered by the Surgeon General. Surgeon Isaiah H. White, Chief Surgeon\r\nof the post, and Surgeon R. R. Stevenson, in charge of the Prison\r\nHospital, have afforded me every facility for the prosecution of my\r\nlabors among the sick outside of the Stockade.\r\n               Very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n                         JOSEPH JONES, Surgeon P. A. C. S.\r\n\r\nBrigadier General JOHN H. WINDER,\r\nCommandant, Post Andersonville.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the absence of General Winder from the post, Captain Winder furnished\r\nthe following order:\r\n\r\n                              CAMP SUMTER, ANDERSONVILLE;\r\n                                        September 17, 1864.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN:--You will permit Surgeon Joseph Jones, who has orders from the\r\nSurgeon General, to visit the sick within the Stockade that are under\r\nmedical treatment. Surgeon Jones is ordered to make certain\r\ninvestigations which may prove useful to his profession. By direction of\r\nGeneral Winder.\r\n                              Very respectfully,\r\n                                        W. S. WINDER, A. A. G.\r\n\r\nCaptain H. WIRZ, Commanding Prison.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Description of the Confederate States Military Prison Hospital at\r\n     Andersonville. Number of prisoners, physical condition, food,\r\n     clothing, habits, moral condition, diseases.\r\n\r\nThe Confederate Military Prison at Andersonville, Ga., consists of a\r\nstrong Stockade, twenty feet in height, enclosing twenty-seven acres.\r\nThe Stockade is formed of strong pine logs, firmly planted in the\r\nground. The main Stockade is surrounded by two other similar rows of\r\npine logs, the middle Stockade being sixteen feet high, and the outer\r\ntwelve feet. These are intended for offense and defense. If the inner\r\nStockade should at any time be forced by the prisoners, the second\r\nforms another line of defense; while in case of an attempt to deliver\r\nthe prisoners by a force operating upon the exterior, the outer line\r\nforms an admirable protection to the Confederate troops, and a most\r\nformidable obstacle to cavalry or infantry. The four angles of the\r\nouter line are strengthened by earthworks upon commanding eminences,\r\nfrom which the cannon, in case of an outbreak among the prisoners, may\r\nsweep the entire enclosure; and it was designed to connect these works\r\nby a line of rifle pits, running zig-zag, around the outer Stockade;\r\nthose rifle pits have never been completed. The ground enclosed by the\r\ninnermost Stockade lies in the form of a parallelogram, the larger\r\ndiameter running almost due north and south. This space includes the\r\nnorthern and southern opposing sides of two hills, between which a\r\nstream of water runs from west to east. The surface soil of these hills\r\nis composed chiefly of sand with varying admixtures of clay and oxide\r\nof iron. The clay is sufficiently tenacious to give a considerable\r\ndegree of consistency to the soil. The internal structure of the hills,\r\nas revealed by the deep wells, is similar to that already described.\r\nThe alternate layers of clay and sand, as well as the oxide of iron,\r\nwhich forms in its various combinations a cement to the sand, allow of\r\nextensive tunneling. The prisoners not only constructed numerous dirt\r\nhuts with balls of clay and sand, taken from the wells which they have\r\nexcavated all over those hills, but they have also, in some cases,\r\ntunneled extensively from these wells. The lower portions of these\r\nhills, bordering on the stream, are wet and boggy from the constant\r\noozing of water. The Stockade was built originally to accommodate only\r\nten thousand prisoners, and included at first seventeen acres. Near the\r\nclose of the month of June the area was enlarged by the addition of\r\nten acres. The ground added was situated on the northern slope of the\r\nlargest hill.\r\n\r\nThe average number of square feet of ground to each prisoner in August\r\n1864: 35.7\r\n\r\nWithin the circumscribed area of the Stockade the Federal prisoners\r\nwere compelled to perform all the offices of life--cooking, washing,\r\nthe calls of nature, exercise, and sleeping. During the month of March\r\nthe prison was less crowded than at any subsequent time, and then the\r\naverage space of ground to each prisoner was only 98.7 feet, or less\r\nthan seven square yards. The Federal prisoners were gathered from all\r\nparts of the Confederate States east of the Mississippi, and crowded\r\ninto the confined space, until in the month of June the average number\r\nof square feet of ground to each prisoner was only 33.2 or less than\r\nfour square yards. These figures represent the condition of the\r\nStockade in a better light even than it really was; for a considerable\r\nbreadth of land along the stream, flowing from west to east between\r\nthe hills, was low and boggy, and was covered with the excrement of\r\nthe men, and thus rendered wholly uninhabitable, and in fact useless\r\nfor every purpose except that of defecation. The pines and other small\r\ntrees and shrubs, which originally were scattered sparsely over these\r\nhills, were in a short time cut down and consumed by the prisoners\r\nfor firewood, and no shade tree was left in the entire enclosure\r\nof the stockade. With their characteristic industry and ingenuity,\r\nthe Federals constructed for themselves small huts and caves, and\r\nattempted to shield themselves from the rain and sun and night damps\r\nand dew. But few tents were distributed to the prisoners, and those\r\nwere in most cases torn and rotten. In the location and arrangement of\r\nthese tents and huts no order appears to have been followed; in fact,\r\nregular streets appear to be out of the question in so crowded an\r\narea; especially too, as large bodies of prisoners were from time to\r\ntime added suddenly without any previous preparations. The irregular\r\narrangement of the huts and imperfect shelters was very unfavorable for\r\nthe maintenance of a proper system of police.\r\n\r\nThe police and internal economy of the prison was left almost entirely\r\nin the hands of the prisoners themselves; the duties of the Confederate\r\nsoldiers acting as guards being limited to the occupation of the\r\nboxes or lookouts ranged around the stockade at regular intervals,\r\nand to the manning of the batteries at the angles of the prison.\r\nEven judicial matters pertaining to themselves, as the detection and\r\npunishment of such crimes as theft and murder appear to have been\r\nin a great measure abandoned to the prisoners. A striking instance\r\nof this occurred in the month of July, when the Federal prisoners\r\nwithin the Stockade tried, condemned, and hanged six (6) of their own\r\nnumber, who had been convicted of stealing and of robbing and murdering\r\ntheir fellow-prisoners. They were all hung upon the same day, and\r\nthousands of the prisoners gathered around to witness the execution.\r\nThe Confederate authorities are said not to have interfered with these\r\nproceedings. In this collection of men from all parts of the world,\r\nevery phase of human character was represented; the stronger preyed\r\nupon the weaker, and even the sick who were unable to defend themselves\r\nwere robbed of their scanty supplies of food and clothing. Dark stories\r\nwere afloat, of men, both sick and well, who were murdered at night,\r\nstrangled to death by their comrades for scant supplies of clothing or\r\nmoney. I heard a sick and wounded Federal prisoner accuse his nurse, a\r\nfellow-prisoner of the United States Army, of having stealthily, during\r\nhis sleep inoculated his wounded arm with gangrene, that he might\r\ndestroy his life and fall heir to his clothing.\r\n\r\n               ....................................\r\n\r\nThe large number of men confined within the Stockade soon, under a\r\ndefective system of police, and with imperfect arrangements, covered\r\nthe surface of the low grounds with excrements. The sinks over\r\nthe lower portions of the stream were imperfect in their plan and\r\nstructure, and the excrements were in large measure deposited so near\r\nthe borders of the stream as not to be washed away, or else accumulated\r\nupon the low boggy ground. The volume of water was not sufficient to\r\nwash away the feces, and they accumulated in such quantities in the\r\nlower portion of the stream as to form a mass of liquid excrement heavy\r\nrains caused the water of the stream to rise, and as the arrangements\r\nfor the passage of the increased amounts of water out of the Stockade\r\nwere insufficient, the liquid feces overflowed the low grounds and\r\ncovered them several inches, after the subsidence of the waters.\r\nThe action of the sun upon this putrefying mass of excrements and\r\nfragments of bread and meat and bones excited most rapid fermentation\r\nand developed a horrible stench. Improvements were projected for the\r\nremoval of the filth and for the prevention of its accumulation, but\r\nthey were only partially and imperfectly carried out. As the forces of\r\nthe prisoners were reduced by confinement, want of exercise, improper\r\ndiet, and by scurvy, diarrhea, and dysentery, they were unable to\r\nevacuate their bowels within the stream or along its banks, and the\r\nexcrements were deposited at the very doors of their tents. The vast\r\nmajority appeared to lose all repulsion to filth, and both sick and\r\nwell disregarded all the laws of hygiene and personal cleanliness. The\r\naccommodations for the sick were imperfect and insufficient. From the\r\norganization of the prison, February 24, 1864, to May 22, the sick\r\nwere treated within the Stockade. In the crowded condition of the\r\nStockade, and with the tents and huts clustered thickly around the\r\nhospital, it was impossible to secure proper ventilation or to maintain\r\nthe necessary police. The Federal prisoners also made frequent forays\r\nupon the hospital stores and carried off the food and clothing of the\r\nsick. The hospital was, on the 22d of May, removed to its present site\r\nwithout the Stockade, and five acres of ground covered with oaks and\r\npines appropriated to the use of the sick.\r\n\r\nThe supply of medical officers has been insufficient from the\r\nfoundation of the prison.\r\n\r\nThe nurses and attendants upon the sick have been most generally\r\nFederal prisoners, who in too many cases appear to have been devoid of\r\nmoral principle, and who not only neglected their duties, but were also\r\nengaged in extensive robbing of the sick.\r\n\r\nFrom the want of proper police and hygienic regulations alone it\r\nis not wonderful that from February 24 to September 21, 1864, nine\r\nthousand four hundred and seventy-nine deaths, nearly one-third the\r\nentire number of prisoners, should have been recorded. I found the\r\nStockade and hospital in the following condition during my pathological\r\ninvestigations, instituted in the month of September, 1864:\r\n\r\n\r\n               STOCKADE, CONFEDERATE STATES MILITARY PRISON.\r\n\r\nAt the time of my visit to Andersonville a large number of Federal\r\nprisoners had been removed to Millen, Savannah; Charleston, and other\r\nparts of, the Confederacy, in anticipation of an advance of General\r\nSherman’s forces from Atlanta, with the design of liberating their\r\ncaptive brethren; however, about fifteen thousand prisoners remained\r\nconfined within the limits of the Stockade and Confederate States\r\nMilitary Prison Hospital.\r\n\r\nIn the Stockade, with the exception of the damp lowlands bordering the\r\nsmall stream, the surface was covered with huts, and small ragged tents\r\nand parts of blankets and fragments of oil-cloth, coats, and blankets\r\nstretched upon stacks. The tents and huts were not arranged according\r\nto any order, and there was in most parts of the enclosure scarcely\r\nroom for two men to walk abreast between the tents and huts.\r\n\r\nIf one might judge from the large pieces of corn-bread scattered\r\nabout in every direction on the ground the prisoners were either very\r\nlavishly supplied with this article of diet, or else this kind of food\r\nwas not relished by them.\r\n\r\nEach day the dead from the Stockade were carried out by their\r\nfellow-prisoners and deposited upon the ground under a bush arbor, just\r\noutside of the Southwestern Gate. From thence they were carried in\r\ncarts to the burying ground, one-quarter of a mile northwest, of the\r\nPrison. The dead were buried without coffins, side by side, in trenches\r\nfour feet deep.\r\n\r\nThe low grounds bordering the stream were covered with human excrements\r\nand filth of all kinds, which in many places appeared to be alive with\r\nworking maggots. An indescribable sickening stench arose from these\r\nfermenting masses of human filth.\r\n\r\nThere were near five thousand seriously ill Federals in the Stockade\r\nand Confederate States Military Prison Hospital, and the deaths\r\nexceeded one hundred per day, and large numbers of the prisoners\r\nwho were walking about, and who had not been entered upon the\r\nsick reports, were suffering from severe and incurable diarrhea,\r\ndysentery, and scurvy. The sick were attended almost entirely by\r\ntheir fellow-prisoners, appointed as nurses, and as they received but\r\nlittle attention, they were compelled to exert themselves at all times\r\nto attend to the calls of nature, and hence they retained the power\r\nof moving about to within a comparatively short period of the close\r\nof life. Owing to the slow progress of the diseases most prevalent,\r\ndiarrhea, and chronic dysentery, the corpses were as a general rule\r\nemaciated.\r\n\r\nI visited two thousand sick within the Stockade, lying under some long\r\nsheds which had been built at the northern portion for themselves. At\r\nthis time only one medical officer was in attendance, whereas at least\r\ntwenty medical officers should have been employed.\r\n\r\nDied in the Stockade from its organization, February 24, 186l to\r\nSeptember 2l ....................................................3,254\r\nDied in Hospital during same time ...............................6,225\r\n\r\nTotal deaths in Hospital and Stockade ...........................9,479\r\n\r\nScurvy, diarrhea, dysentery, and hospital gangrene were the prevailing\r\ndiseases. I was surprised to find but few cases of malarial fever, and\r\nno well-marked cases either of typhus or typhoid fever. The absence\r\nof the different forms of malarial fever may be accounted for in the\r\nsupposition that the artificial atmosphere of the Stockade, crowded\r\ndensely with human beings and loaded with animal exhalations, was\r\nunfavorable to the existence and action of the malarial poison. The\r\nabsence of typhoid and typhus fevers amongst all the causes which\r\nare supposed to generate these diseases, appeared to be due to the\r\nfact that the great majority of these prisoners had been in captivity\r\nin Virginia, at Belle Island, and in other parts of the Confederacy\r\nfor months, and even as long as two years, and during this time they\r\nhad been subjected to the same bad influences, and those who had not\r\nhad these fevers before either had them during their confinement in\r\nConfederate prisons or else their systems, from long exposure, were\r\nproof against their action.\r\n\r\nThe effects of scurvy were manifested on every hand, and in all its\r\nvarious stages, from the muddy, pale complexion, pale gums, feeble,\r\nlanguid muscular motions, lowness of spirits, and fetid breath, to the\r\ndusky, dirty, leaden complexion, swollen features, spongy, purple,\r\nlivid, fungoid, bleeding gums, loose teeth, oedematous limbs, covered\r\nwith livid vibices, and petechiae spasmodically flexed, painful and\r\nhardened extremities, spontaneous hemorrhages from mucous canals, and\r\nlarge, ill-conditioned, spreading ulcers covered with a dark purplish\r\nfungus growth. I observed that in some of the cases of scurvy the\r\nparotid glands were greatly swollen, and in some instances to such an\r\nextent as to preclude entirely the power to articulate. In several\r\ncases of dropsy of the abdomen and lower extremities supervening upon\r\nscurvy, the patients affirmed that previously to the appearance of the\r\ndropsy they had suffered with profuse and obstinate diarrhea, and that\r\nwhen this was checked by a change of diet, from Indian corn-bread baked\r\nwith the husk, to boiled rice, the dropsy appeared. The severe pains\r\nand livid patches were frequently associated with swellings in various\r\nparts, and especially in the lower extremities, accompanied with\r\nstiffness and contractions of the knee joints and ankles, and often\r\nwith a brawny feel of the parts, as if lymph had been effused between\r\nthe integuments and apeneuroses, preventing the motion of the skin over\r\nthe swollen parts. Many of the prisoners believed that the scurvy was\r\ncontagious, and I saw men guarding their wells and springs, fearing\r\nlest some man suffering with the scurvy might use the water and thus\r\npoison them.\r\n\r\nI observed also numerous cases of hospital gangrene, and of spreading\r\nscorbutic ulcers, which had supervened upon slight injuries. The\r\nscorbutic ulcers presented a dark, purple fungoid, elevated surface,\r\nwith livid swollen edges, and exuded a thin; fetid, sanious fluid,\r\ninstead of pus. Many ulcers which originated from the scorbutic\r\ncondition of the system appeared to become truly gangrenous, assuming\r\nall the characteristics of hospital gangrene. From the crowded\r\ncondition, filthy habits, bad diet, and dejected, depressed condition\r\nof the prisoners, their systems had become so disordered that the\r\nsmallest abrasion of the skin, from the rubbing of a shoe, or from\r\nthe effects of the sun, or from the prick of a splinter, or from\r\nscratching, or a musketo bite, in some cases, took on rapid and\r\nfrightful ulceration and gangrene. The long use of salt meat, ofttimes\r\nimperfectly cured, as well as the most total deprivation of vegetables\r\nand fruit, appeared to be the chief causes of the scurvy. I carefully\r\nexamined the bakery and the bread furnished the prisoners, and found\r\nthat they were supplied almost entirely with corn-bread from which the\r\nhusk had not been separated. This husk acted as an irritant to the\r\nalimentary canal, without adding any nutriment to the bread. As far as\r\nmy examination extended no fault could be found with the mode in which\r\nthe bread was baked; the difficulty lay in the failure to separate the\r\nhusk from the corn-meal. I strongly urged the preparation of large\r\nquantities of soup made from the cow and calves’ heads with the brains\r\nand tongues, to which a liberal supply of sweet potatos and vegetables\r\nmight have been advantageously added. The material existed in abundance\r\nfor the preparation of such soup in large quantities with but little\r\nadditional expense. Such aliment would have been not only highly\r\nnutritious, but it would also have acted as an efficient remedial\r\nagent for the removal of the scorbutic condition. The sick within the\r\nStockade lay under several long sheds which were originally built for\r\nbarracks. These sheds covered two floors which were open on all sides.\r\nThe sick lay upon the bare boards, or upon such ragged blankets as they\r\npossessed, without, as far as I observed, any bedding or even straw.\r\n\r\n                    ............................\r\n\r\nThe haggard, distressed countenances of these miserable, complaining,\r\ndejected, living skeletons, crying for medical aid and food, and\r\ncursing their Government for its refusal to exchange prisoners, and\r\nthe ghastly corpses, with their glazed eye balls staring up into\r\nvacant space, with the flies swarming down their open and grinning\r\nmouths, and over their ragged clothes, infested with numerous lice,\r\nas they lay amongst the sick and dying, formed a picture of helpless,\r\nhopeless misery which it would be impossible to portray bywords or by\r\nthe brush. A feeling of disappointment and even resentment on account\r\nof the United States Government upon the subject of the exchange\r\nof prisoners, appeared to be widespread, and the apparent hopeless\r\nnature of the negotiations for some general exchange of prisoners\r\nappeared to be a cause of universal regret and deep and injurious\r\ndespondency. I heard some of the prisoners go so far as to exonerate\r\nthe Confederate Government from any charge of intentionally subjecting\r\nthem to a protracted confinement, with its necessary and unavoidable\r\nsufferings, in a country cut off from all intercourse with foreign\r\nnations, and sorely pressed on all sides, whilst on the other hand they\r\ncharged their prolonged captivity upon their own Government, which\r\nwas attempting to make the negro equal to the white man. Some hundred\r\nor more of the prisoners had been released from confinement in the\r\nStockade on parole, and filled various offices as clerks, druggists,\r\nand carpenters, etc., in the various departments. These men were well\r\nclothed, and presented a stout and healthy appearance, and as a general\r\nrule they presented a much more robust and healthy appearance than the\r\nConfederate troops guarding the prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe entire grounds are surrounded by a frail board fence, and are\r\nstrictly guarded by Confederate soldiers, and no prisoner except the\r\nparoled attendants is allowed to leave the grounds except by a special\r\npermit from the Commandant of the Interior of the Prison.\r\n\r\nThe patients and attendants, near two thousand in number, are crowded\r\ninto this confined space and are but poorly supplied with old and\r\nragged tents. Large numbers of them were without any bunks in the\r\ntents, and lay upon the ground, oft-times without even a blanket.\r\nNo beds or straw appeared to have been furnished. The tents extend\r\nto within a few yards of the small stream, the eastern portion of\r\nwhich, as we have before said, is used as a privy and is loaded with\r\nexcrements; and I observed a large pile of corn-bread, bones, and\r\nfilth of all kinds, thirty feet in diameter and several feet in hight,\r\nswarming with myriads of flies, in a vacant space near the pots used\r\nfor cooking. Millions of flies swarmed over everything, and covered the\r\nfaces of the sleeping patients, and crawled down their open mouths,\r\nand deposited their maggots in the gangrenous wounds of the living,\r\nand in the mouths of the dead. Musketos in great numbers also infested\r\nthe tents, and many of the patients were so stung by these pestiferous\r\ninsects, that they resembled those suffering from a slight attack of\r\nthe measles.\r\n\r\nThe police and hygiene of the hospital were defective in the extreme;\r\nthe attendants, who appeared in almost every instance to have been\r\nselected from the prisoners, seemed to have in many cases but little\r\ninterest in the welfare of their fellow-captives. The accusation was\r\nmade that the nurses in many cases robbed the sick of their clothing,\r\nmoney, and rations, and carried on a clandestine trade with the paroled\r\nprisoners and Confederate guards without the hospital enclosure, in\r\nthe clothing, effects of the sick, dying, and dead Federals. They\r\ncertainly appeared to neglect the comfort and cleanliness of the sick\r\nintrusted to their care in a most shameful manner, even after making\r\ndue allowances for the difficulties of the situation. Many of the sick\r\nwere literally encrusted with dirt and filth and covered with vermin.\r\nWhen a gangrenous wound needed washing, the limb was thrust out a\r\nlittle from the blanket, or board, or rags upon which the patient was\r\nlying, and water poured over it, and all the putrescent matter allowed\r\nto soak into the ground floor of the tent. The supply of rags for\r\ndressing wounds was said to be very scant, and I saw the most filthy\r\nrags which had been applied several times, and imperfectly washed, used\r\nin dressing wounds. Where hospital gangrene was prevailing, it was\r\nimpossible for any wound to escape contagion under these circumstances.\r\nThe results of the treatment of wounds in the hospital were of the\r\nmost unsatisfactory character, from this neglect of cleanliness, in\r\nthe dressings and wounds themselves, as well as from various other\r\ncauses which will be more fully considered. I saw several gangrenous\r\nwounds filled with maggots. I have frequently seen neglected wounds\r\namongst the Confederate soldiers similarly affected; and as far as my\r\nexperience extends, these worms destroy only the dead tissues and do\r\nnot injure specially the well parts. I have even heard surgeons affirm\r\nthat a gangrenous wound which had been thoroughly cleansed by maggots,\r\nhealed more rapidly than if it had been left to itself. This want of\r\ncleanliness on the part of the nurses appeared to be the result of\r\ncarelessness and inattention, rather than of malignant design, and\r\nthe whole trouble can be traced to the want of the proper police and\r\nsanitary regulations, and to the absence of intelligent organization\r\nand division of labor. The abuses were in a large measure due to the\r\nalmost total absence of system, government, and rigid, but wholesome\r\nsanitary regulations. In extenuation of these abuses it was alleged by\r\nthe medical officers that the Confederate troops were barely sufficient\r\nto guard the prisoners, and that it was impossible to obtain any number\r\nof experienced nurses from the Confederate forces. In fact the guard\r\nappeared to be too small, even for the regulation of the internal\r\nhygiene and police of the hospital.\r\n\r\nThe manner of disposing of the dead was also calculated to depress\r\nthe already desponding spirits of these men, many of whom have been\r\nconfined for months, and even for nearly two years in Richmond and\r\nother places, and whose strength had been wasted by bad air, bad\r\nfood, and neglect of personal cleanliness. The dead-house is merely a\r\nframe covered with old tent cloth and a few bushes, situated in the\r\nsouthwestern corner of the hospital grounds. When a patient dies, he\r\nis simply laid in the narrow street in front of his tent, until he is\r\nremoved by Federal negros detailed to carry off the dead; if a patient\r\ndies during the night, he lies there until the morning, and during the\r\nday even the dead were frequently allowed to remain for hours in these\r\nwalks. In the dead-house the corpses lie upon the bare ground, and were\r\nin most cases covered with filth and vermin.\r\n\r\n                    ............................\r\n\r\nThe cooking arrangements are of the most defective character. Five\r\nlarge iron pots similar to those used for boiling sugar cane, appeared\r\nto be the only cooking utensils furnished by the hospital for the\r\ncooking of nearly two thousand men; and the patients were dependent in\r\ngreat measure upon their own miserable utensils. They were allowed to\r\ncook in the tent doors and in the lanes, and this was another source\r\nof filth, and another favorable condition for the generation and\r\nmultiplication of flies and other vermin.\r\n\r\nThe air of the tents was foul and disagreeable in the extreme, and\r\nin fact the entire grounds emitted a most nauseous and disgusting\r\nsmell. I entered nearly all the tents and carefully examined the cases\r\nof interest, and especially the cases of gangrene, upon numerous\r\noccasions, during the prosecution of my pathological inquiries at\r\nAndersonville, and therefore enjoyed every opportunity to judge\r\ncorrectly of the hygiene and police of the hospital.\r\n\r\nThere appeared to be almost absolute indifference and neglect on\r\nthe part of the patients of personal cleanliness; their persons and\r\nclothing inmost instances, and especially of those suffering with\r\ngangrene and scorbutic ulcers, were filthy in the extreme and covered\r\nwith vermin. It was too often the case that patients were received from\r\nthe Stockade in a most deplorable condition. I have seen men brought\r\nin from the Stockade in a dying condition, begrimed from head to foot\r\nwith their own excrements, and so black from smoke and filth that they,\r\nresembled negros rather than white men. That this description of the\r\nStockade and hospital has not been overdrawn, will appear from the\r\nreports of the surgeons in charge, appended to this report.\r\n\r\n                    .........................\r\n\r\nWe will examine first the consolidated report of the sick and wounded\r\nFederal prisoners. During six months, from the 1st of March to the\r\n31st of August, forty-two thousand six hundred and eighty-six cases of\r\ndiseases and wounds were reported. No classified record of the sick in\r\nthe Stockade was kept after the establishment of the hospital without\r\nthe Prison. This fact, in conjunction with those already presented\r\nrelating to the insufficiency of medical officers and the extreme\r\nillness and even death of many prisoners in the tents in the Stockade,\r\nwithout any medical attention or record beyond the bare number of the\r\ndead, demonstrate that these figures, large as they, appear to be, are\r\nfar below the truth.\r\n\r\nAs the number of prisoners varied greatly at different periods, the\r\nrelations between those reported sick and well, as far as those\r\nstatistics extend, can best be determined by a comparison of the\r\nstatistics of each month.\r\n\r\nDuring this period of six months no less than five hundred and\r\nsixty-five deaths are recorded under the head of ‘morbi vanie.’ In\r\nother words, those men died without having received sufficient medical\r\nattention for the determination of even the name of the disease causing\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of August fifty-three cases and fifty-three deaths\r\nare recorded as due to marasmus. Surely this large number of deaths\r\nmust have been due to some other morbid state than slow wasting. If\r\nthey were due to improper and insufficient food, they should have been\r\nclassed accordingly, and if to diarrhea or dysentery or scurvy, the\r\nclassification should in like manner have been explicit.\r\n\r\nWe observe a progressive increase of the rate of mortality, from\r\n3.11 per cent. in March to 9.09 per cent. of mean strength, sick and\r\nwell, in August. The ratio of mortality continued to increase during\r\nSeptember, for notwithstanding the removal of one-half of the entire\r\nnumber of prisoners during the early portion of the month, one thousand\r\nseven hundred and sixty-seven (1,767) deaths are registered from\r\nSeptember 1 to 21, and the largest number of deaths upon any one day\r\noccurred during this month, on the 16th, viz. one hundred and nineteen.\r\n\r\nThe entire number of Federal prisoners confined at Andersonville was\r\nabout forty thousand six hundred and eleven; and during the period of\r\nnear seven months, from February 24 to September 21, nine thousand four\r\nhundred and seventy-nine (9,479) deaths were recorded; that is, during\r\nthis period near one-fourth, or more, exactly one in 4.2, or 13.3 per\r\ncent., terminated fatally. This increase of mortality was due in great\r\nmeasure to the accumulation of the sources of disease, as the increase\r\nof excrements and filth of all kinds, and the concentration of noxious\r\neffluvia, and also to the progressive effects of salt diet, crowding,\r\nand the hot climate.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CONCLUSIONS.\r\n\r\n1st. The great mortality among the Federal prisoners confined in the\r\nmilitary prison at Andersonville was not referable to climatic causes,\r\nor to the nature of the soil and waters.\r\n\r\n2d. The chief causes of death were scurvy and its results and bowel\r\naffections-chronic and acute diarrhea and dysentery. The bowel\r\naffections appear to have been due to the diet, the habits of the\r\npatients, the depressed, dejected state of the nervous system and\r\nmoral and intellectual powers, and to the effluvia arising from the\r\ndecomposing animal and vegetable filth. The effects of salt meat, and\r\nan unvarying diet of cornmeal, with but few vegetables, and imperfect\r\nsupplies of vinegar and syrup, were manifested in the great prevalence\r\nof scurvy. This disease, without doubt, was also influenced to an\r\nimportant extent in its origin and course by the foul animal emanations.\r\n\r\n3d. From the sameness of the food and form, the action of the poisonous\r\ngases in the densely crowded and filthy Stockade and hospital, the\r\nblood was altered in its constitution, even before the manifestation of\r\nactual disease. In both the well and the sick the red corpuscles were\r\ndiminished; and in all diseases uncomplicated with inflammation, the\r\nfibrous element was deficient. In cases of ulceration of the mucous\r\nmembrane of the intestinal canal, the fibrous element of the blood was\r\nincreased; while in simple diarrhea, uncomplicated with ulceration, it\r\nwas either diminished or else remained stationary. Heart clots were\r\nvery common, if not universally present, in cases of ulceration of\r\nthe intestinal mucous membrane, while in the uncomplicated cases of\r\ndiarrhea and scurvy, the blood was fluid and did not coagulate readily,\r\nand the heart clots and fibrous concretions were almost universally\r\nabsent. From the watery condition of the blood, there resulted various\r\nserous effusions into the pericardium, ventricles of the brain, and\r\ninto the abdomen. In almost all the cases which I examined after death,\r\neven the most emaciated, there was more or less serous effusion into\r\nthe abdominal cavity. In cases of hospital gangrene of the extremities,\r\nand in cases of gangrene of the intestines, heart clots and fibrous\r\ncoagula were universally present. The presence of those clots in the\r\ncases of hospital gangrene, while they were absent in the cases in\r\nwhich there was no inflammatory symptoms, sustains the conclusion that\r\nhospital gangrene is a species of inflammation, imperfect and irregular\r\nthough it may be in its progress, in which the fibrous element and\r\ncoagulation of the blood are increased, even in those who are suffering\r\nfrom such a condition of the blood, and from such diseases as are\r\nnaturally accompanied with a decrease in the fibrous constituent.\r\n\r\n4th. The fact that hospital Gangrene appeared in the Stockade first,\r\nand originated spontaneously without any previous contagion, and\r\noccurred sporadically all over the Stockade and prison hospital, was\r\nproof positive that this disease will arise whenever the conditions of\r\ncrowding, filth, foul air, and bad diet are present. The exhalations\r\nfrom the hospital and Stockade appeared to exert their effects to\r\na considerable distance outside of these localities. The origin of\r\nhospital gangrene among these prisoners appeared clearly to depend in\r\ngreat measure upon the state of the general system induced by diet, and\r\nvarious external noxious influences. The rapidity of the appearance\r\nand action of the gangrene depended upon the powers and state of the\r\nconstitution, as well as upon the intensity of the poison in the\r\natmosphere, or upon the direct application of poisonous matter to the\r\nwounded surface. This was further illustrated by the important fact\r\nthat hospital gangrene, or a disease resembling it in all essential\r\nrespects, attacked the intestinal canal of patients laboring under\r\nulceration of the bowels, although there were no local manifestations\r\nof gangrene upon the surface of the body. This mode of termination\r\nin cases of dysentery was quite common in the foul atmosphere of the\r\nConfederate States Military Hospital, in the depressed, depraved\r\ncondition of the system of these Federal prisoners.\r\n\r\n5th. A scorbutic condition of the system appeared to favor the origin\r\nof foul ulcers, which frequently took on true hospital gangrene. Scurvy\r\nand hospital gangrene frequently existed in the same individual. In\r\nsuch cases, vegetable diet, with vegetable acids, would remove the\r\nscorbutic condition without curing the hospital gangrene. From the\r\nresults of the existing war for the establishment of the independence\r\nof the Confederate States, as well as from the published observations\r\nof Dr. Trotter, Sir Gilbert Blane, and others of the English navy\r\nand army, it is evident that the scorbutic condition of the system,\r\nespecially in crowded ships and camps, is most favorable to the origin\r\nand spread of foul ulcers and hospital gangrene. As in the present\r\ncase of Andersonville, so also in past times when medical hygiene was\r\nalmost entirely neglected, those two diseases were almost universally\r\nassociated in crowded ships. In many cases it was very difficult to\r\ndecide at first whether the ulcer was a simple result of scurvy or of\r\nthe action of the prison or hospital gangrene, for there was great\r\nsimilarity in the appearance of the ulcers in the two diseases. So\r\ncommonly have those two diseases been combined in their origin and\r\naction, that the description of scorbutic ulcers, by many authors,\r\nevidently includes also many of the prominent characteristics of\r\nhospital gangrene. This will be rendered evident by an examination\r\nof the observations of Dr. Lind and Sir Gilbert Blane upon scorbutic\r\nulcers.\r\n\r\n6th. Gangrenous spots followed by rapid destruction of tissue\r\nappeared in some cases where there had been no known wound. Without\r\nsuch well-established facts, it might be assumed that the disease\r\nwas propagated from one patient to another. In such a filthy and\r\ncrowded hospital as that of the Confederate States Military Prison\r\nat Andersonville, it was impossible to isolate the wounded from the\r\nsources of actual contact of the gangrenous matter. The flies swarming\r\nover the wounds and over filth of every kind, the filthy, imperfectly\r\nwashed and scanty supplies of rags, and the limited supply of washing\r\nutensils, the same wash-bowl serving for scores of patients, were\r\nsources of such constant circulation of the gangrenous matter that\r\nthe disease might rapidly spread from a single gangrenous wound.\r\nThe fact already stated, that a form of moist gangrene, resembling\r\nhospital gangrene, was quite common in this foul atmosphere, in cases\r\nof dysentery, both with and without the existence of the disease upon\r\nthe entire surface, not only demonstrates the dependence of the disease\r\nupon the state of the constitution, but proves in the clearest manner\r\nthat neither the contact of the poisonous matter of gangrene, nor the\r\ndirect action of the poisonous atmosphere upon the ulcerated surfaces\r\nis necessary to the development of the disease.\r\n\r\n7th. In this foul atmosphere amputation did not arrest hospital\r\ngangrene; the disease almost invariably returned. Almost every\r\namputation was followed finally by death, either from the effects of\r\ngangrene or from the prevailing diarrhea and dysentery. Nitric acid and\r\nescharotics generally in this crowded atmosphere, loaded with noxious\r\neffluvia, exerted only temporary effects; after their application\r\nto the diseased surfaces, the gangrene would frequently return with\r\nredoubled energy; and even after the gangrene had been completely\r\nremoved by local and constitutional treatment, it would frequently\r\nreturn and destroy the patient. As far as my observation extended, very\r\nfew of the cases of amputation for gangrene recovered. The progress of\r\nthese cases was frequently very deceptive. I have observed after death\r\nthe most extensive disorganization of the structures of the stump, when\r\nduring life there was but little swelling of the part, and the patient\r\nwas apparently doing well. I endeavored to impress upon the medical\r\nofficers the view that in this disease treatment was almost useless,\r\nwithout an abundant supply of pure, fresh air, nutritious food, and\r\ntonics and stimulants. Such changes, however, as would allow of the\r\nisolation of the cases of hospital gangrene appeared to be out of the\r\npower of the medical officers.\r\n\r\n8th. The gangrenous mass was without true pus, and consisted chiefly of\r\nbroken-down, disorganized structures. The reaction of the gangrenous\r\nmatter in certain stages was alkaline.\r\n\r\n9th. The best, and in truth the only means of protecting large armies\r\nand navies, as well as prisoners, from the ravages of hospital\r\ngangrene, is to furnish liberal supplies of well-cured meat, together\r\nwith fresh beef and vegetables, and to enforce a rigid system of\r\nhygiene.\r\n\r\n10th. Finally, this gigantic mass of human misery calls loudly\r\nfor relief, not only for the sake of suffering humanity, but also\r\non account of our own brave soldiers now captives in the hands of\r\nthe Federal Government. Strict justice to the gallant men of the\r\nConfederate Armies, who have been or who may be, so unfortunate as\r\nto be compelled to surrender in battle, demands that the Confederate\r\nGovernment should adopt that course which will best secure their health\r\nand comfort in captivity; or at least leave their enemies without a\r\nshadow of an excuse for any violation of the rules of civilized warfare\r\nin the treatment of prisoners.\r\n\r\n                    [End of the Witness’s Testimony.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe variation--from month to month--of the proportion of deaths to the\r\nwhole number living is singular and interesting. It supports the theory\r\nI have advanced above, as the following facts, taken from the official\r\nreport, will show:\r\n     In April one in every sixteen died.\r\n     In May one in every twenty-six died.\r\n     In June one in every twenty-two died.\r\n     In July one in every eighteen died.\r\n     In August one in every eleven died.\r\n     In September one in every three died.\r\n     In October one in every two died.\r\n     In November one in every three died.\r\n\r\nDoes the reader fully understand that in September one-third of those\r\nin the pen died, that in October one-half of the remainder perished,\r\nand in November one-third of those who still survived, died? Let him\r\npause for a moment and read this over carefully again; because its\r\nstartling magnitude will hardly dawn upon him at first reading. It is\r\ntrue that the fearfully disproportionate mortality of those months\r\nwas largely due to the fact that it was mostly the sick that remained\r\nbehind, but even this diminishes but little the frightfulness of the\r\nshowing. Did any one ever hear of an epidemic so fatal that one-third\r\nof those attacked by it in one month died; one-half of the remnant the\r\nnext month, and one-third of the feeble remainder the next month? If he\r\ndid, his reading has been much more extensive than mine.\r\n\r\nThe greatest number of deaths in one day is reported to have occurred\r\non the 23d of August, when one hundred and twenty-seven died, or one\r\nman every eleven minutes.\r\n\r\nThe greatest number of prisoners in the Stockade is stated to have\r\nbeen August 8, when there were thirty-three thousand one hundred and\r\nfourteen.\r\n\r\nI have always imagined both these statements to be short of the truth,\r\nbecause my remembrance is that one day in August I counted over two\r\nhundred dead lying in a row. As for the greatest number of prisoners,\r\nI remember quite distinctly standing by the ration wagon during the\r\nwhole time of the delivery of rations, to see how many prisoners\r\nthere really were inside. That day the One Hundred and Thirty-Third\r\nDetachment was called, and its Sergeant came up and drew rations for\r\na full detachment. All the other detachments were habitually kept\r\nfull by replacing those who died with new comers. As each detachment\r\nconsisted of two hundred and seventy men, one hundred and thirty-three\r\ndetachments would make thirty-five thousand nine hundred and ten,\r\nexclusive of those in the hospital, and those detailed outside as\r\ncooks, clerks, hospital attendants and various other employments--say\r\nfrom one to two thousand more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nDIFFICULTY OF EXERCISING--EMBARRASSMENTS OF A MORNING WALK--THE RIALTO\r\nOF THE PRISON--CURSING THE SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY--THE STORY OF THE\r\nBATTLE OF SPOTTSYLVANIA COURTHOUSE.\r\n\r\nCertainly, in no other great community, that ever existed upon the face\r\nof the globe was there so little daily ebb and flow as in this. Dull\r\nas an ordinary Town or City may be; however monotonous, eventless,\r\neven stupid the lives of its citizens, there is yet, nevertheless, a\r\nflow every day of its life-blood--its population towards its heart,\r\nand an ebb of the same, every evening towards its extremities. These\r\nrecurring tides mingle all classes together and promote the general\r\nhealthfulness, as the constant motion hither and yon of the ocean’s\r\nwaters purify and sweeten them.\r\n\r\nThe lack of these helped vastly to make the living mass inside the\r\nStockade a human Dead Sea--or rather a Dying Sea--a putrefying,\r\nstinking lake, resolving itself into phosphorescent corruption, like\r\nthose rotting southern seas, whose seething filth burns in hideous\r\nreds, and ghastly greens and yellows.\r\n\r\nBeing little call for motion of any kind, and no room to exercise\r\nwhatever wish there might be in that direction, very many succumbed\r\nunresistingly to the apathy which was so strongly favored by\r\ndespondency and the weakness induced by continual hunger, and lying\r\nsupinely on the hot sand, day in and day out, speedily brought\r\nthemselves into such a condition as invited the attacks of disease.\r\n\r\nIt required both determination and effort to take a little walking\r\nexercise. The ground was so densely crowded with holes and other\r\ndevices for shelter that it took one at least ten minutes to pick his\r\nway through the narrow and tortuous labyrinth which served as paths\r\nfor communication between different parts of the Camp. Still further,\r\nthere was nothing to see anywhere or to form sufficient inducement for\r\nany one to make so laborious a journey. One simply encountered at every\r\nnew step the same unwelcome sights that he had just left; there was\r\na monotony in the misery as in everything else, and consequently the\r\ntemptation to sit or lie still in one’s own quarters became very great.\r\n\r\nI used to make it a point to go to some of the remoter parts of the\r\nStockade once every day, simply for exercise. One can gain some idea of\r\nthe crowd, and the difficulty of making one’s way through it, when I\r\nsay that no point in the prison could be more than fifteen hundred feet\r\nfrom where I staid, and, had the way been clear, I could have walked\r\nthither and back in at most a half an hour, yet it usually took me from\r\ntwo to three hours to make one of these journeys.\r\n\r\nThis daily trip, a few visits to the Creek to wash all over, a few\r\ngames of chess, attendance upon roll call, drawing rations, cooking\r\nand eating the same, “lousing” my fragments of clothes, and doing some\r\nlittle duties for my sick and helpless comrades, constituted the daily\r\nroutine for myself, as for most of the active youths in the prison.\r\n\r\nThe Creek was the great meeting point for all inside the Stockade. All\r\nable to walk were certain to be there at least once during the day, and\r\nwe made it a rendezvous, a place to exchange gossip, discuss the latest\r\nnews, canvass the prospects of exchange, and, most of all, to curse the\r\nRebels. Indeed no conversation ever progressed very far without both\r\nspeaker and listener taking frequent rests to say bitter things as to\r\nthe Rebels generally, and Wirz, Winder and Davis in particular.\r\n\r\nA conversation between two boys--strangers to each other who came\r\nto the Creek to wash themselves or their clothes, or for some other\r\npurpose, would progress thus:\r\n\r\nFirst Boy--“I belong to the Second Corps,--Hancock’s, [the Army of the\r\nPotomac boys always mentioned what Corps they belonged to, where the\r\nWestern boys stated their Regiment.] They got me at Spottsylvania,\r\nwhen they were butting their heads against our breast-works, trying to\r\nget even with us for gobbling up Johnson in the morning,”--He stops\r\nsuddenly and changes tone to say: “I hope to God, that when our folks\r\nget Richmond, they will put old Ben Butler in command of it, with\r\norders to limb, skin and jayhawk it worse than he did New Orleans.”\r\n\r\nSecond Boy, (fervently:) “I wish to God he would, and that he’d catch\r\nold Jeff., and that grayheaded devil, Winder, and the old Dutch\r\nCaptain, strip ’em just as we were, put ’em in this pen, with just the\r\nrations they are givin’ us, and set a guard of plantation niggers over\r\n’em, with orders to blow their whole infernal heads off, if they dared\r\nso much as to look at the dead line.”\r\n\r\nFirst Boy--(returning to the story of his capture.) “Old Hancock caught\r\nthe Johnnies that morning the neatest you ever saw anything in your\r\nlife. After the two armies had murdered each other for four or five\r\ndays in the Wilderness, by fighting so close together that much of the\r\ntime you could almost shake hands with the Graybacks, both hauled off\r\na little, and lay and glowered at each other. Each side had lost about\r\ntwenty thousand men in learning that if it attacked the other it would\r\nget mashed fine. So each built a line of works and lay behind them, and\r\ntried to nag the other into coming out and attacking. At Spottsylvania\r\nour lines and those of the Johnnies weren’t twelve hundred yards\r\napart. The ground was clear and clean between them, and any force that\r\nattempted to cross it to attack would be cut to pieces, as sure as\r\nanything. We laid there three or four days watching each other--just\r\nlike boys at school, who shake fists and dare each other. At one place\r\nthe Rebel line ran out towards us like the top of a great letter ‘A.’\r\nThe night of the 11th of May it rained very hard, and then came a fog\r\nso thick that you couldn’t see the length of a company. Hancock thought\r\nhe’d take advantage of this. We were all turned out very quietly about\r\nfour o’clock in the morning. Not a bit of noise was allowed. We even\r\nhad to take off our canteens and tin cups, that they might not rattle\r\nagainst our bayonets. The ground was so wet that our footsteps couldn’t\r\nbe heard. It was one of those deathly, still movements, when you think\r\nyour heart is making as much noise as a bass drum.\r\n\r\n“The Johnnies didn’t seem to have the faintest suspicion of what was\r\ncoming, though they ought, because we would have expected such an\r\nattack from them if we hadn’t made it ourselves. Their pickets were\r\nout just a little ways from their works, and we were almost on to them\r\nbefore they discovered us. They fired and ran back. At this we raised a\r\nyell and dashed forward at a charge. As we poured over the works, the\r\nRebels came double-quicking up to defend them. We flanked Johnson’s\r\nDivision quicker’n you could say ‘Jack Robinson,’ and had four thousand\r\nof ’em in our grip just as nice as you please. We sent them to the rear\r\nunder guard, and started for the next line of Rebel works about a half\r\na mile away. But we had now waked up the whole of Lee’s army, and they\r\nall came straight for us, like packs of mad wolves. Ewell struck us in\r\nthe center; Longstreet let drive at our left flank, and Hill tackled\r\nour right. We fell back to the works we had taken, Warren and Wright\r\ncame up to help us, and we had it hot and heavy for the rest of the day\r\nand part of the night. The Johnnies seemed so mad over what we’d done\r\nthat they were half crazy. They charged us five times, coming up every\r\ntime just as if they were going to lift us right out of the works with\r\nthe bayonet. About midnight, after they’d lost over ten thousand men,\r\nthey seemed to understand that we had pre-empted that piece of real\r\nestate, and didn’t propose to allow anybody to jump our claim, so they\r\nfell back sullen like to their main works. When they came on the last\r\ncharge, our Brigadier walked behind each of our regiments and said:\r\n\r\n“Boys, we’ll send ’em back this time for keeps. Give it to ’em by the\r\nacre, and when they begin to waver, we’ll all jump over the works and\r\ngo for them with the bayonet.’\r\n\r\n“We did it just that way. We poured such a fire on them that the\r\nbullets knocked up the ground in front just like you have seen the\r\ndeep dust in a road in the middle of Summer fly up when the first\r\ngreat big drops of a rain storm strike it. But they came on, yelling\r\nand swearing, officers in front waving swords, and shouting--all that\r\nbusiness, you know. When they got to about one hundred yards from us,\r\nthey did not seem to be coming so fast, and there was a good deal of\r\nconfusion among them. The brigade bugle sounded:\r\n\r\n“Stop firing.”\r\n\r\n“We all ceased instantly. The rebels looked up in astonishment. Our\r\nGeneral sang out:\r\n\r\n“Fix bayonets!’ but we knew what was coming, and were already executing\r\nthe order. You can imagine the crash that ran down the line, as every\r\nfellow snatched his bayonet out and slapped it on the muzzle of his\r\ngun. Then the General’s voice rang out like a bugle:\r\n\r\n“Ready!--FORWARD! CHARGE!’\r\n\r\n“We cheered till everything seemed to split, and jumped over the works,\r\nalmost every man at the same minute. The Johnnies seemed to have been\r\npuzzled at the stoppage of our fire. When we all came sailing over\r\nthe works, with guns brought right, down where they meant business,\r\nthey were so astonished for a minute that they stood stock still, not\r\nknowing whether to come for us, or run. We did not allow them long\r\nto debate, but went right towards them on the double quick, with the\r\nbayonets looking awful savage and hungry. It was too much for Mr.\r\nJohnny Reb’s nerves. They all seemed to about face’ at once, and they\r\nlit out of there as if they had been sent for in a hurry. We chased\r\nafter ’em as fast as we could, and picked up just lots of ’em. Finally\r\nit began to be real funny. A Johnny’s wind would begin to give out\r\nhe’d fall behind his comrades; he’d hear us yell and think that we\r\nwere right behind him, ready to sink a bayonet through him’; he’d turn\r\naround, throw up his hands, and sing out:\r\n\r\n“I surrender, mister! I surrender!’ and find that we were a hundred\r\nfeet off, and would have to have a bayonet as long as one of\r\nMcClellan’s general orders to touch him.\r\n\r\n“Well, my company was the left of our regiment, and our regiment was\r\nthe left of the brigade, and we swung out ahead of all the rest of\r\nthe boys. In our excitement of chasing the Johnnies, we didn’t see\r\nthat we had passed an angle of their works. About thirty of us had\r\nbecome separated from the company and were chasing a squad of about\r\nseventy-five or one hundred. We had got up so close to them that we\r\nhollered:\r\n\r\n“‘Halt there, now, or we’ll blow your heads off.’\r\n\r\n“They turned round with, ‘halt yourselves; you ---- Yankee ---- ----’\r\n\r\n“We looked around at this, and saw that we were not one hundred feet\r\naway from the angle of the works, which were filled with Rebels\r\nwaiting for our fellows to get to where they could have a good flank\r\nfire upon them. There was nothing to do but to throw down our guns\r\nand surrender, and we had hardly gone inside of the works, until the\r\nJohnnies opened on our brigade and drove it back. This ended the battle\r\nat Spottsylvania Court House.”\r\n\r\nSecond Boy (irrelevantly.) “Some day the underpinning will fly out from\r\nunder the South, and let it sink right into the middle kittle o’ hell.”\r\n\r\nFirst Boy (savagely.) “I only wish the whole Southern Confederacy was\r\nhanging over hell by a single string, and I had a knife.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nREBEL MUSIC--SINGULAR LACK OF THE CREATIVE POWER AMONG THE SOUTHERNERS\r\n--CONTRAST WITH SIMILAR PEOPLE ELSEWHERE--THEIR FAVORITE MUSIC, AND\r\nWHERE IT WAS BORROWED FROM--A FIFER WITH ONE TUNE.\r\n\r\nI have before mentioned as among the things that grew upon one with\r\nincreasing acquaintance with the Rebels on their native heath, was\r\nastonishment at their lack of mechanical skill and at their inability\r\nto grapple with numbers and the simpler processes of arithmetic.\r\nAnother characteristic of the same nature was their wonderful lack of\r\nmusical ability, or of any kind of tuneful creativeness.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, all over the world, people living under similar conditions\r\nto the Southerners are exceedingly musical, and we owe the great\r\nmajority of the sweetest compositions which delight the ear and\r\nsubdue the senses to unlettered song-makers of the Swiss mountains,\r\nthe Tyrolese valleys, the Bavarian Highlands, and the minstrels of\r\nScotland, Ireland and Wales.\r\n\r\nThe music of English-speaking people is very largely made up of these\r\ncontributions from the folk-songs of dwellers in the wilder and more\r\nmountainous parts of the British Isles. One rarely goes far out of\r\nthe way in attributing to this source any air that he may hear that\r\ncaptivates him with its seductive opulence of harmony. Exquisite\r\nmelodies, limpid and unstrained as the carol of a bird in Spring-time,\r\nand as plaintive as the cooing of a turtle-dove seems as natural\r\nproducts of the Scottish Highlands as the gorse which blazons on their\r\nhillsides in August. Debarred from expressing their aspirations as\r\npeople of broader culture do--in painting, in sculpture, in poetry and\r\nprose, these mountaineers make song the flexible and ready instrument\r\nfor the communication of every emotion that sweeps across their souls.\r\n\r\nLove, hatred, grief, revenge, anger, and especially war seems to tune\r\ntheir minds to harmony, and awake the voice of song in them hearts.\r\nThe battles which the Scotch and Irish fought to replace the luckless\r\nStuarts upon the British throne--the bloody rebellions of 1715 and\r\n1745, left a rich legacy of sweet song, the outpouring of loving,\r\npassionate loyalty to a wretched cause; songs which are today esteemed\r\nand sung wherever the English language is spoken, by people who have\r\nlong since forgotten what burning feelings gave birth to their favorite\r\nmelodies.\r\n\r\nFor a century the bones of both the Pretenders have moldered in alien\r\nsoil; the names of James Edward, and Charles Edward, which were once\r\ntrumpet blasts to rouse armed men, mean as little to the multitude of\r\ntoday as those of the Saxon Ethelbert, and Danish Hardicanute, yet\r\nthe world goes on singing--and will probably as long as the English\r\nlanguage is spoken--“Wha’ll be King but Charlie?” “When Jamie Come\r\nHame,” “Over the Water to Charlie,” “Charlie is my Darling,” “The Bonny\r\nBlue Bonnets are Over the Border,” “Saddle Your Steeds and Awa,” and a\r\nmyriad others whose infinite tenderness and melody no modern composer\r\ncan equal.\r\n\r\nYet these same Scotch and Irish, the same Jacobite English,\r\ntransplanted on account of their chronic rebelliousness to the\r\nmountains of Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia, seem to have lost\r\ntheir tunefulness, as some fine singing birds do when carried from\r\ntheir native shores.\r\n\r\nThe descendants of those who drew swords for James and Charles at\r\nPreston Pans and Culloden dwell to-day in the dales and valleys of\r\nthe Alleganies, as their fathers did in the dales and valleys of the\r\nGrampians, but their voices are mute.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the Southerners are fond of music. They are fond of singing\r\nand listening to old-fashioned ballads, most of which have never\r\nbeen printed, but handed down from one generation to the other, like\r\nthe ‘Volklieder’ of Germany. They sing these with the wild, fervid\r\nimpressiveness characteristic of the ballad singing of unlettered\r\npeople. Very many play tolerably on the violin and banjo, and\r\noccasionally one is found whose instrumentation may be called good. But\r\nabove this hight they never soar. The only musician produced by the\r\nSouth of whom the rest of the country has ever heard, is Blind Tom,\r\nthe negro idiot. No composer, no song writer of any kind has appeared\r\nwithin the borders of Dixie.\r\n\r\nIt was a disappointment to me that even the stress of the war, the\r\npassion and fierceness with which the Rebels felt and fought, could\r\nnot stimulate any adherent of the Stars and Bars into the production\r\nof a single lyric worthy in the remotest degree of the magnitude of\r\nthe struggle, and the depth of the popular feeling. Where two million\r\nScotch, fighting to restore the fallen fortunes of the worse than\r\nworthless Stuarts, filled the world with immortal music, eleven million\r\nof Southerners, fighting for what they claimed to be individual freedom\r\nand national life, did not produce any original verse, or a bar of\r\nmusic that the world could recognize as such. This is the fact; and an\r\nundeniable one. Its explanation I must leave to abler analysts than I\r\nam.\r\n\r\nSearching for peculiar causes we find but two that make the South\r\ndiffer from the ancestral home of these people. These two were Climate\r\nand Slavery. Climatic effects will not account for the phenomenon,\r\nbecause we see that the peasantry of the mountains of Spain and the\r\nSouth of France as ignorant as these people, and dwellers in a still\r\nmore enervating atmosphere-are very fertile in musical composition,\r\nand their songs are to the Romanic languages what the Scotch and Irish\r\nballads are to the English.\r\n\r\nThen it must be ascribed to the incubus of Slavery upon the intellect,\r\nwhich has repressed this as it has all other healthy growths in the\r\nSouth. Slavery seems to benumb all the faculties except the passions.\r\nThe fact that the mountaineers had but few or no slaves, does not seem\r\nto be of importance in the case. They lived under the deadly shadow\r\nof the upas tree, and suffered the consequences of its stunting their\r\ndevelopment in all directions, as the ague-smitten inhabitant of\r\nthe Roman Campana finds every sense and every muscle clogged by the\r\nfiltering in of the insidious miasma. They did not compose songs and\r\nmusic, because they did not have the intellectual energy for that work.\r\n\r\nThe negros displayed all the musical creativeness of that section.\r\nTheir wonderful prolificness in wild, rude songs, with strangely\r\nmelodious airs that burned themselves into the memory, was one of the\r\nsalient characteristics of that down-trodden race. Like the Russian\r\nserfs, and the bondmen of all ages and lands, the songs they made and\r\nsang all had an undertone of touching plaintiveness, born of ages of\r\ndumb suffering. The themes were exceedingly simple, and the range of\r\nsubjects limited. The joys, and sorrows, hopes and despairs of love’s\r\ngratification or disappointment, of struggles for freedom, contests\r\nwith malign persons and influences, of rage, hatred, jealousy, revenge,\r\nsuch as form the motifs for the majority of the poetry of free and\r\nstrong races, were wholly absent from their lyrics. Religion, hunger\r\nand toil were their main inspiration. They sang of the pleasures of\r\nidling in the genial sunshine; the delights of abundance of food; the\r\neternal happiness that awaited them in the heavenly future, where the\r\nslave-driver ceased from troubling and the weary were at rest; where\r\nTime rolled around in endless cycles of days spent in basking, harp in\r\nhand, and silken clad, in golden streets, under the soft effulgence of\r\ncloudless skies, glowing with warmth and kindness emanating from the\r\nCreator himself. Had their masters condescended to borrow the music of\r\nthe slaves, they would have found none whose sentiments were suitable\r\nfor the ode of a people undergoing the pangs of what was hoped to be\r\nthe birth of a new nation.\r\n\r\nThe three songs most popular at the South, and generally regarded as\r\ndistinctively Southern, were “The Bonnie Blue Flag,” “Maryland, My\r\nMaryland,” and “Stonewall Jackson Crossing into Maryland.” The first of\r\nthese was the greatest favorite by long odds. Women sang, men whistled,\r\nand the so-called musicians played it wherever we went. While in the\r\nfield before capture, it was the commonest of experiences to have\r\nRebel women sing it at us tauntingly from the house that we passed\r\nor near which we stopped. If ever near enough a Rebel camp, we were\r\nsure to hear its wailing crescendo rising upon the air from the lips\r\nor instruments of some one more quartered there. At Richmond it rang\r\nupon us constantly from some source or another, and the same was true\r\nwherever else we went in the so-called Confederacy. I give the air and words below:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nAll familiar with Scotch songs will readily recognize the name and air\r\nas an old friend, and one of the fierce Jacobite melodies that for a\r\nlong time disturbed the tranquility of the Brunswick family on the\r\nEnglish throne. The new words supplied by the Rebels are the merest\r\ndoggerel, and fit the music as poorly as the unchanged name of the song\r\nfitted to its new use. The flag of the Rebellion was not a bonnie blue\r\none; but had quite as much red and white as azure. It did not have a\r\nsingle star, but thirteen.\r\n\r\nNear in popularity was “Maryland, My Maryland.” The versification of\r\nthis was of a much higher Order, being fairly respectable. The air is\r\nold, and a familiar one to all college students, and belongs to one of\r\nthe most common of German household songs:\r\n\r\n          O, Tannenbaum! O, Tannenbaum, wie tru sind deine Blatter!\r\n          Da gruenst nicht nur zur Sommerseit,\r\n          Nein, auch in Winter, when es Schneit, etc.\r\n\r\nwhich Longfellow has finely translated,\r\n\r\nO, hemlock tree! O, hemlock tree! how faithful are thy branches!\r\nGreen not alone in Summer time,\r\nBut in the Winter’s float and rime.\r\nO, hemlock tree O, hemlock tree! how faithful are thy branches. Etc.\r\n\r\nThe Rebel version ran:\r\n\r\n          MARYLAND.\r\n\r\nThe despot’s heel is on thy shore,\r\n          Maryland!\r\nHis touch is at thy temple door,\r\n          Maryland!\r\nAvenge the patriotic gore\r\nThat flecked the streets of Baltimore,\r\nAnd be the battle queen of yore,\r\nMaryland! My Maryland!\r\n\r\nHark to the wand’ring son’s appeal,\r\n          Maryland!\r\nMy mother State, to thee I kneel,\r\n          Maryland!\r\nFor life and death, for woe and weal,\r\nThy peerless chivalry reveal,\r\nAnd gird thy beauteous limbs with steel,\r\nMaryland! My Maryland!\r\n\r\nThou wilt not cower in the duet,\r\n          Maryland!\r\nThy beaming sword shall never rust\r\n          Maryland!\r\nRemember Carroll’s sacred trust,\r\nRemember Howard’s warlike thrust--\r\nAnd all thy slumberers with the just,\r\nMaryland! My Maryland!\r\n\r\nCome! ’tis the red dawn of the day,\r\n          Maryland!\r\nCome! with thy panoplied array,\r\n          Maryland!\r\nWith Ringgold’s spirit for the fray,\r\nWith Watson’s blood at Monterey,\r\nWith fearless Lowe and dashing May,\r\nMaryland! My Maryland!\r\n\r\nComet for thy shield is bright and strong,\r\n          Maryland!\r\nCome! for thy dalliance does thee wrong,\r\n          Maryland!\r\nCome! to thins own heroic throng,\r\nThat stalks with Liberty along,\r\nAnd give a new Key to thy song,\r\nMaryland! My Maryland!\r\n\r\nDear Mother! burst the tyrant’s chain,\r\n          Maryland!\r\nVirginia should not call in vain,\r\n          Maryland!\r\nShe meets her sisters on the plain--\r\n‘Sic semper’ ’tis the proud refrain,\r\nThat baffles millions back amain,\r\n          Maryland!\r\nArise, in majesty again,\r\nMaryland! My Maryland!\r\n\r\nI see the blush upon thy cheek,\r\n          Maryland!\r\nBut thou wast ever bravely meek,\r\n          Maryland!\r\nBut lo! there surges forth a shriek\r\nFrom hill to hill, from creek to creek--\r\nPotomac calls to Chesapeake,\r\nMaryland! My Maryland!\r\n\r\nThou wilt not yield the vandal toll.\r\n          Maryland!\r\nThou wilt not crook to his control,\r\n          Maryland!\r\nBetter the fire upon thee roll,\r\nBetter the blade, the shot, the bowl,\r\nThan crucifixion of the soul,\r\nMaryland! My Maryland!\r\n\r\nI hear the distant Thunder hem,\r\n          Maryland!\r\nThe Old Line’s bugle, fife, and drum.\r\n          Maryland!\r\nShe is not dead, nor deaf, nor dumb--\r\nHnzza! she spurns the Northern scum!\r\nShe breathes--she burns! she’ll come! she’ll come!\r\nMaryland! My Maryland!\r\n\r\n\r\n“Stonewall Jackson Crossing into Maryland,” was another travesty, of\r\nabout the same literary merit, or rather demerit, as “The Bonnie Blue\r\nFlag.” Its air was that of the well-known and popular negro minstrel\r\nsong, “Billy Patterson.” For all that, it sounded very martial and\r\nstirring when played by a brass band.\r\n\r\nWe heard these songs with tiresome iteration, daily and nightly, during\r\nour stay in the Southern Confederacy. Some one of the guards seemed to\r\nbe perpetually beguiling the weariness of his watch by singing in all\r\nkeys, in every sort of a voice, and with the wildest latitude as to\r\nair and time. They became so terribly irritating to us, that to this\r\nday the remembrance of those soul-lacerating lyrics abides with me as\r\none of the chief of the minor torments of our situation. They were, in\r\nfact, nearly as bad as the lice.\r\n\r\nWe revenged ourselves as best we could by constructing fearfully\r\nwicked, obscene and insulting parodies on these, and by singing them\r\nwith irritating effusiveness in the hearing of the guards who were\r\ninflicting these nuisances upon us.\r\n\r\nOf the same nature was the garrison music. One fife, played by an\r\nasthmatic old fellow whose breathings were nearly as audible as his\r\nnotes, and one rheumatic drummer, constituted the entire band for the\r\npost. The fifer actually knew but one tune “The Bonnie Blue Flag” --and\r\ndid not know that well. But it was all that he had, and he played it\r\nwith wearisome monotony for every camp call--five or six times a day,\r\nand seven days in the week. He called us up in the morning with it for\r\na reveille; he sounded the “roll call” and “drill call,” breakfast,\r\ndinner and supper with it, and finally sent us to bed, with the same\r\ndreary wail that had rung in our ears all day. I never hated any piece\r\nof music as I came to hate that threnody of treason. It would have\r\nbeen such a relief if the old asthmatic who played it could have been\r\ninduced to learn another tune to play on Sundays, and give us one day\r\nof rest. He did not, but desecrated the Lord’s Day by playing as vilely\r\nas on the rest of the week. The Rebels were fully conscious of their\r\nmusical deficiencies, and made repeated but unsuccessful attempts to\r\ninduce the musicians among the prisoners to come outside and form a\r\nband.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nAUGUST--NEEDLES STUCK IN PUMPKIN SEEDS--SOME PHENOMENA OF STARVATION\r\n--RIOTING IN REMEMBERED LUXURIES.\r\n\r\n“Illinoy,” said tall, gaunt Jack North, of the One Hundred and\r\nFourteenth Illinois, to me, one day, as we sat contemplating our naked,\r\nand sadly attenuated underpinning; “what do our legs and feet most look\r\nmost like?”\r\n\r\n“Give it up, Jack,” said I.\r\n\r\n“Why--darning needles stuck in pumpkin seeds, of course.” I never heard\r\na better comparison for our wasted limbs.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the great bodily emaciation were sometimes very\r\nstartling. Boys of a fleshy habit would change so in a few weeks as\r\nto lose all resemblance to their former selves, and comrades who came\r\ninto prison later would utterly fail to recognize them. Most fat men,\r\nas most large men, died in a little while after entering, though there\r\nwere exceptions. One of these was a boy of my own company, named George\r\nHillicks. George had shot up within a few years to over six feet in\r\nhight, and then, as such boys occasionally do, had, after enlisting\r\nwith us, taken on such a development of flesh that we nicknamed him\r\nthe “Giant,” and he became a pretty good load for even the strongest\r\nhorse. George held his flesh through Belle Isle, and the earlier weeks\r\nin Andersonville, but June, July, and August “fetched him,” as the\r\nboys said. He seemed to melt away like an icicle on a Spring day, and\r\nhe grew so thin that his hight seemed preternatural. We called him\r\n“Flagstaff,” and cracked all sorts of jokes about putting an insulator\r\non his head, and setting him up for a telegraph pole, braiding his\r\nlegs and using him for a whip lash, letting his hair grow a little\r\nlonger, and trading him off to the Rebels for a sponge and staff for\r\nthe artillery, etc. We all expected him to die, and looked continually\r\nfor the development of the fatal scurvy symptoms, which were to seal\r\nhis doom. But he worried through, and came out at last in good shape, a\r\nhappy result due as much as to anything else to his having in Chester\r\nHayward, of Prairie City, Ill.,--one of the most devoted chums I ever\r\nknew. Chester nursed and looked out for George with wife-like fidelity,\r\nand had his reward in bringing him safe through our lines. There were\r\nthousands of instances of this generous devotion to each other by chums\r\nin Andersonville, and I know of nothing that reflects any more credit\r\nupon our boy soldiers.\r\n\r\nThere was little chance for any one to accumulate flesh on the rations\r\nwe were receiving. I say it in all soberness that I do not believe\r\nthat a healthy hen could have grown fat upon them. I am sure that any\r\ngood-sized “shanghai” eats more every day than the meager half loaf\r\nthat we had to maintain life upon. Scanty as this was, and hungry as\r\nall were, very many could not eat it. Their stomachs revolted against\r\nthe trash; it became so nauseous to them that they could not force\r\nit down, even when famishing, and they died of starvation with the\r\nchunks of the so-called bread under their head. I found myself rapidly\r\napproaching this condition. I had been blessed with a good digestion\r\nand a talent for sleeping under the most discouraging circumstances.\r\nThese, I have no doubt, were of the greatest assistance to me in my\r\nstruggle for existence. But now the rations became fearfully obnoxious\r\nto me, and it was only with the greatest effort--pulling the bread into\r\nlittle pieces and swallowing each, of these as one would a pill--that\r\nI succeeded in worrying the stuff down. I had not as yet fallen away\r\nvery much, but as I had never, up, to that time, weighed so much as one\r\nhundred and twenty-five pounds, there was no great amount of adipose to\r\nlose. It was evident that unless some change occurred my time was near\r\nat hand.\r\n\r\nThere was not only hunger for more food, but longing with an intensity\r\nbeyond expression for alteration of some kind in the rations. The\r\nchangeless monotony of the miserable saltless bread, or worse mush, for\r\ndays, weeks and months, became unbearable. If those wretched mule teams\r\nhad only once a month hauled in something different--if they had come\r\nin loaded with sweet potatos, green corn or wheat flour, there would be\r\nthousands of men still living who now slumber beneath those melancholy\r\npines. It would have given something to look forward to, and remember\r\nwhen past. But to know each day that the gates would open to admit the\r\nsame distasteful apologies for food took away the appetite and raised\r\none’s gorge, even while famishing for something to eat.\r\n\r\nWe could for a while forget the stench, the lice, the heat, the\r\nmaggots, the dead and dying around us, the insulting malignance of our\r\njailors; but it was, very hard work to banish thoughts and longings\r\nfor food from our minds. Hundreds became actually insane from brooding\r\nover it. Crazy men could be found in all parts of the camp. Numbers of\r\nthem wandered around entirely naked. Their babblings and maunderings\r\nabout something to eat were painful to hear. I have before mentioned\r\nthe case of the Plymouth Pilgrim near me, whose insanity took the form\r\nof imagining that he was sitting at the table with his family, and\r\nwho would go through the show of helping them to imaginary viands and\r\ndelicacies. The cravings for green food of those afflicted with the\r\nscurvy were, agonizing. Large numbers of watermelons were brought to\r\nthe prison, and sold to those who had the money to pay for them at from\r\none to five dollars, greenbacks, apiece. A boy who had means to buy a\r\npiece of these would be followed about while eating it by a crowd of\r\nperhaps twenty-five or thirty livid-gummed scorbutics, each imploring\r\nhim for the rind when he was through with it.\r\n\r\nWe thought of food all day, and were visited with torturing dreams\r\nof it at night. One of the pleasant recollections of my pre-military\r\nlife was a banquet at the “Planter’s House,” St. Louis, at which I was\r\na boyish guest. It was, doubtless, an ordinary affair, as banquets\r\ngo, but to me then, with all the keen appreciation of youth and first\r\nexperience, it was a feast worthy of Lucullus. But now this delightful\r\nreminiscence became a torment. Hundreds of times I dreamed I was\r\nagain at the “Planter’s.” I saw the wide corridors, with their mosaic\r\npavement; I entered the grand dining-room, keeping timidly near the\r\nfriend to whose kindness I owed this wonderful favor; I saw again the\r\nmirror-lined walls, the evergreen decked ceilings, the festoons and\r\nmottos, the tables gleaming with cutglass and silver, the buffets with\r\nwines and fruits, the brigade of sleek, black, white-aproned waiters,\r\nheaded by one who had presence enough for a major General. Again I\r\nreveled in all the dainties and dishes on the bill-of-fare; calling for\r\neverything that I dared to, just to see what each was like, and to be\r\nable to say afterwards that I had partaken of it; all these bewildering\r\ndelights of the first realization of what a boy has read and wondered\r\nmuch over, and longed for, would dance their rout and reel through\r\nmy somnolent brain. Then I would awake to find myself a half-naked,\r\nhalf-starved, vermin-eaten wretch, crouching in a hole in the ground,\r\nwaiting for my keepers to fling me a chunk of corn bread.\r\n\r\nNaturally the boys--and especially the country boys and new prisoners\r\n--talked much of victuals--what they had had, and what they would have\r\nagain, when they got out. Take this as a sample of the conversation\r\nwhich might be heard in any group of boys, sitting together on the\r\nsand, killin lice and talking of exchange:\r\n\r\nTom--“Well, Bill, when we get back to God’s country, you and Jim and\r\nJohn must all come to my house and take dinner with me. I want to give\r\nyou a square meal. I want to show you just what good livin’ is. You\r\nknow my mother is just the best cook in all that section. When she lays\r\nherself out to get up a meal all the other women in the neighborhood\r\njust stand back and admire!”\r\n\r\nBill--“O, that’s all right; but I’ll bet she can’t hold a candle to my\r\nmother, when it comes to good cooking.”\r\n\r\nJim--“No, nor to mine.”\r\n\r\nJohn--(with patronizing contempt.) “O, shucks! None of you fellers were\r\never at our house, even when we had one of our common weekday dinners.”\r\n\r\nTom--(unheedful of the counter claims.) I hev teen studyin’ up the\r\ndinner I’d like, and the bill-of-fare I’d set out for you fellers when\r\nyou come over to see me. First, of course, we’ll lay the foundation\r\nlike with a nice, juicy loin roast, and some mashed potatos.\r\n\r\nBill--(interrupting.) “Now, do you like mashed potatos with beef? The\r\nway may mother does is to pare the potatos, and lay them in the pan\r\nalong with the beef. Then, you know, they come out just as nice and\r\ncrisp, and brown; they have soaked up all the beef gravy, and they\r\ncrinkle between your teeth--”\r\n\r\nJim--“Now, I tell you, mashed Neshannocks with butter on ’em is plenty\r\ngood enough for me.”\r\n\r\nJohn--“If you’d et some of the new kind of peachblows that we raised in\r\nthe old pasture lot the year before I enlisted, you’d never say another\r\nword about your Neshannocks.”\r\n\r\nTom--(taking breath and starting in fresh.) “Then we’ll hev some fried\r\nSpring chickens, of our dominick breed. Them dominicks of ours have the\r\nnicest, tenderest meat, better’n quail, a darned sight, and the way my\r\nmother can fry Spring chickens----”\r\n\r\nBill--(aside to Jim.) “Every durned woman in the country thinks she can\r\n‘spry ching frickens;’ but my mother---”\r\n\r\nJohn--“You fellers all know that there’s nobody knows half as much\r\nabout chicken doin’s as these ’tinerant Methodis’ preachers. They give\r\n’em chicken wherever they go, and folks do say that out in the new\r\nsettlements they can’t get no preachin’, no gospel, nor nothin’, until\r\nthe chickens become so plenty that a preacher is reasonably sure of\r\nhavin’ one for his dinner wherever he may go. Now, there’s old Peter\r\nCartwright, who has traveled over Illinoy and Indianny since the Year\r\nOne, and preached more good sermons than any other man who ever set on\r\nsaddle-bags, and has et more chickens than there are birds in a big\r\npigeon roost. Well, he took dinner at our house when he came up to\r\ndedicate the big, white church at Simpkin’s Corners, and when he passed\r\nup his plate the third time for more chicken, he sez, sez he:--I’ve et\r\nat a great many hundred tables in the fifty years I have labored in the\r\nvineyard of the Redeemer, but I must say, Mrs. Kiggins, that your way\r\nof frying chickens is a leetle the nicest that I ever knew. I only wish\r\nthat the sisters generally would get your reseet.’ Yes, that’s what he\r\nsaid,--‘a leetle the nicest.’”\r\n\r\nTom--“An’ then, we’ll hev biscuits an’ butter. I’ll just bet five\r\nhundred dollars to a cent, and give back the cent if I win, that we\r\nhave the best butter at our house that there is in Central Illinoy. You\r\ncan’t never hev good butter onless you have a spring house; there’s no\r\nuse of talkin’--all the patent churns that lazy men ever invented--all\r\nthe fancy milk pans an’ coolers, can’t make up for a spring house.\r\nLocations for a spring house are scarcer than hen’s teeth in Illinoy,\r\nbut we hev one, and there ain’t a better one in Orange County, New\r\nYork. Then you’ll see dome of the biscuits my mother makes.”\r\n\r\nBill--“Well, now, my mother’s a boss biscuit-maker, too.”\r\n\r\nJim--“You kin just gamble that mine is.”\r\n\r\nJohn--“O, that’s the way you fellers ought to think an’ talk, but my\r\nmother----”\r\n\r\nTom--(coming in again with fresh vigor) “They’re jest as light an’\r\nfluffy as a dandelion puff, and they melt in your month like a ripe\r\nBartlett pear. You just pull ’em open--Now you know that I think\r\nthere’s nothin’ that shows a person’s raisin’ so well as to see him\r\neat biscuits an’ butter. If he’s been raised mostly on corn bread, an’\r\ncommon doins,’ an’ don’t know much about good things to eat, he’ll most\r\nlikely cut his biscuit open with a case knife, an’ make it fall as flat\r\nas one o’ yesterday’s pancakes. But if he is used to biscuits, has had\r\n’em often at his house, he’ll--just pull ’em open, slow an’ easy like,\r\nthen he’ll lay a little slice of butter inside, and drop a few drops\r\nof clear honey on this, an’ stick the two halves back, together again,\r\nan--”\r\n\r\n“Oh, for God Almighty’s sake, stop talking that infernal nonsense,”\r\nroar out a half dozen of the surrounding crowd, whose mouths have been\r\nwatering over this unctuous recital of the good things of the table.\r\n“You blamed fools, do you want to drive yourselves and everybody else\r\ncrazy with such stuff as that. Dry up and try to think of something\r\nelse.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nSURLY BRITON--THE STOLID COURAGE THAT MAKES THE ENGLISH FLAG A\r\nBANNER OF TRIUMPH--OUR COMPANY BUGLER, HIS CHARACTERISTICS AND HIS\r\nDEATH--URGENT DEMAND FOR MECHANICS--NONE WANT TO GO--TREATMENT OF\r\nA REBEL SHOEMAKER --ENLARGEMENT OF THE STOCKADE--IT IS BROKEN BY A\r\nSTORM--THE WONDERFUL SPRING.\r\n\r\nEarly in August, F. Marriott, our Company Bugler, died. Previous to\r\ncoming to America he had been for many years an English soldier, and\r\nI accepted him as a type of that stolid, doggedly brave class, which\r\nforms the bulk of the English armies, and has for centuries carried\r\nthe British flag with dauntless courage into every land under the\r\nsun. Rough, surly and unsocial, he did his duty with the unemotional\r\nsteadiness of a machine. He knew nothing but to obey orders, and obeyed\r\nthem under all circumstances promptly, but with stony impassiveness.\r\nWith the command to move forward into action, he moved forward without\r\na word, and with face as blank as a side of sole leather. He went\r\nas far as ordered, halted at the word, and retired at command as\r\nphlegmatically as he advanced. If he cared a straw whether he advanced\r\nor retreated, if it mattered to the extent of a pinch of salt whether\r\nwe whipped the Rebels or they defeated us, he kept that feeling so\r\ndeeply hidden in the recesses of his sturdy bosom that no one ever\r\nsuspected it. In the excitement of action the rest of the boys shouted,\r\nand swore, and expressed their tense feelings in various ways, but\r\nMarriott might as well have been a graven image, for all the expression\r\nthat he suffered to escape. Doubtless, if the Captain had ordered him\r\nto shoot one of the company through the heart, he would have executed\r\nthe command according to the manual of arms, brought his carbine to\r\na “recover,” and at the word marched back to his quarters without an\r\ninquiry as to the cause of the proceedings. He made no friends, and\r\nthough his surliness repelled us, he made few enemies. Indeed, he was\r\nrather a favorite, since he was a genuine character; his gruffness had\r\nno taint of selfish greed in it; he minded his own business strictly,\r\nand wanted others to do the same. When he first came into the company,\r\nit is true, he gained the enmity of nearly everybody in it, but an\r\nincident occurred which turned the tide in his favor. Some annoying\r\nlittle depredations had been practiced on the boys, and it needed\r\nbut a word of suspicion to inflame all their minds against the surly\r\nEnglishman as the unknown perpetrator. The feeling intensified, until\r\nabout half of the company were in a mood to kill the Bugler outright.\r\nAs we were returning from stable duty one evening, some little\r\noccurrence fanned the smoldering anger into a fierce blaze; a couple\r\nof the smaller boys began an attack upon him; others hastened to their\r\nassistance, and soon half the company were engaged in the assault.\r\n\r\nHe succeeded in disengaging himself from his assailants, and, squaring\r\nhimself off, said, defiantly:\r\n\r\n“Dom yer cowardly heyes; jest come hat me one hat a time, hand hI’ll\r\nwollop the ’ole gang uv ye’s.”\r\n\r\nOne of our Sergeants styled himself proudly “a Chicago rough,” and was\r\nas vain of his pugilistic abilities as a small boy is of a father who\r\nplays in the band. We all hated him cordially--even more than we did\r\nMarriott.\r\n\r\nHe thought this was a good time to show off, and forcing his way\r\nthrough the crowd, he said, vauntingly:\r\n\r\n“Just fall back and form a ring, boys, and see me polish off\r\nthe---fool.”\r\n\r\nThe ring was formed, with the Bugler and the Sergeant in the center.\r\nThough the latter was the younger and stronger the first round showed\r\nhim that it would have profited him much more to have let Marriott’s\r\nchallenge pass unheeded. As a rule, it is as well to ignore all\r\ninvitations of this kind from Englishmen, and especially from those\r\nwho, like Marriott, have served a term in the army, for they are likely\r\nto be so handy with their fists as to make the consequences of an\r\nacceptance more lively than desirable.\r\n\r\nSo the Sergeant found. “Marriott,” as one of the spectators expressed\r\nit, “went around him like a cooper around a barrel.” He planted his\r\nblows just where he wished, to the intense delight of the boys, who\r\nyelled enthusiastically whenever he got in “a hot one,” and their\r\ndelight at seeing the Sergeant drubbed so thoroughly and artistically,\r\nworked an entire revolution in his favor.\r\n\r\nThenceforward we viewed his eccentricities with lenient eyes, and\r\nbecame rather proud of his bull-dog stolidity and surliness. The whole\r\nbattalion soon came to share this feeling, and everybody enjoyed\r\nhearing his deep-toned growl, which mischievous boys would incite by\r\nsome petty annoyances deliberately designed for that purpose. I will\r\nmention incidentally, that after his encounter with the Sergeant no one\r\never again volunteered to “polish” him off.\r\n\r\nAndersonville did not improve either his temper or his\r\ncommunicativeness. He seemed to want to get as far away from the rest\r\nof us as possible, and took up his quarters in a remote corner of\r\nthe Stockade, among utter strangers. Those of us who wandered up in\r\nhis neighborhood occasionally, to see how he was getting along, were\r\nreceived with such scant courtesy, that we did not hasten to repeat\r\nthe visit. At length, after none of us had seen him for weeks, we\r\nthought that comradeship demanded another visit. We found him in the\r\nlast stages of scurvy and diarrhea. Chunks of uneaten corn bread lay\r\nby his head. They were at least a week old. The rations since then had\r\nevidently been stolen from the helpless man by those around him. The\r\nplace where he lay was indescribably filthy, and his body was swarming\r\nwith vermin. Some good Samaritan had filled his little black oyster\r\ncan with water, and placed it within his reach. For a week, at least,\r\nhe had not been able to rise from the ground; he could barely reach\r\nfor the water near him. He gave us such a glare of recognition as I\r\nremembered to have seen light up the fast-darkening eyes of a savage\r\nold mastiff, that I and my boyish companions once found dying in the\r\nwoods of disease and hurts. Had he been able he would have driven us\r\naway, or at least assailed us with biting English epithets. Thus he had\r\ndoubtless driven away all those who had attempted to help him. We did\r\nwhat little we could, and staid with him until the next afternoon, when\r\nhe died. We prepared his body, in the customary way: folded the hands\r\nacross his breast, tied the toes together, and carried it outside, not\r\nforgetting each of us, to bring back a load of wood.\r\n\r\nThe scarcity of mechanics of all kinds in the Confederacy, and the\r\nurgent needs of the people for many things which the war and the\r\nblockade prevented their obtaining, led to continual inducements being\r\noffered to the artizans among us to go outside and work at their\r\ntrade. Shoemakers seemed most in demand; next to these blacksmiths,\r\nmachinists, molders and metal workers generally. Not a week passed\r\nduring my imprisonment that I did not see a Rebel emissary of some kind\r\nabout the prison seeking to engage skilled workmen for some purpose\r\nor another. While in Richmond the managers of the Tredegar Iron Works\r\nwere brazen and persistent in their efforts to seduce what are termed\r\n“malleable iron workers,” to enter their employ. A boy who was master\r\nof any one of the commoner trades had but to make his wishes known, and\r\nhe would be allowed to go out on parole to work. I was a printer, and I\r\nthink that at least a dozen times I was approached by Rebel publishers\r\nwith offers of a parole, and work at good prices. One from Columbia, S.\r\nC., offered me two dollars and a half a “thousand” for composition. As\r\nthe highest price for such work that I had received before enlisting\r\nwas thirty cents a thousand, this seemed a chance to accumulate untold\r\nwealth. Since a man working in day time can set from thirty-five\r\nto fifty “thousand” a week, this would make weekly wages run from\r\neighty-seven dollars and fifty cents to one hundred and twenty-five\r\ndollars--but it was in Confederate money, then worth from ten to twenty\r\ncents on the dollar.\r\n\r\nStill better offers were made to iron workers of all kinds, to\r\nshoemakers, tanners, weavers, tailors, hatters, engineers, machinists,\r\nmillers, railroad men, and similar tradesmen. Any of these could\r\nhave made a handsome thing by accepting the offers made them almost\r\nweekly. As nearly all in the prison had useful trades, it would have\r\nbeen of immense benefit to the Confederacy if they could have been\r\ninduced to work at them. There is no measuring the benefit it would\r\nhave been to the Southern cause if all the hundreds of tanners and\r\nshoemakers in the Stockade could have, been persuaded to go outside\r\nand labor in providing leather and shoes for the almost shoeless\r\npeople and soldiery. The machinists alone could have done more good\r\nto the Southern Confederacy than one of our brigades was doing harm,\r\nby consenting to go to the railroad shops at Griswoldville and ply\r\ntheir handicraft. The lack of material resources in the South was\r\none of the strongest allies our arms had. This lack of resources was\r\nprimarily caused by a lack of skilled labor to develop those resources,\r\nand nowhere could there be found a finer collection of skilled\r\nlaborers than in the thirty-three thousand prisoners incarcerated in\r\nAndersonville.\r\n\r\nAll solicitations to accept a parole and go outside to work at one’s\r\ntrade were treated with the scorn they deserved. If any mechanic\r\nyielded to them, the fact did not come under my notice. The usual reply\r\nto invitations of this kind was:\r\n\r\n“No, Sir! By God, I’ll stay in here till I rot, and the maggots carry\r\nme out through the cracks in the Stockade, before I’ll so much as raise\r\nmy little finger to help the infernal Confederacy, or Rebels, in any\r\nshape or form.”\r\n\r\nIn August a Macon shoemaker came in to get some of his trade to go\r\nback with him to work in the Confederate shoe factory. He prosecuted\r\nhis search for these until he reached the center of the camp on the\r\nNorth Side, when some of the shoemakers who had gathered around him,\r\napparently considering his propositions, seized him and threw him into\r\na well. He was kept there a whole day, and only released when Wirz cut\r\noff the rations of the prison for that day, and announced that no more\r\nwould be issued until the man was returned safe and sound to the gate.\r\n\r\nThe terrible crowding was somewhat ameliorated by the opening in\r\nJuly of an addition--six hundred feet long--to the North Side of the\r\nStockade. This increased the room inside to twenty acres, giving about\r\nan acre to every one thousand seven hundred men,--a preposterously\r\ncontracted area still. The new ground was not a hotbed of virulent\r\npoison like the olds however, and those who moved on to it had that\r\nmuch in their favor.\r\n\r\nThe palisades between the new and the old portions of the pen were left\r\nstanding when the new portion was opened. We were still suffering a\r\ngreat deal of inconvenience from lack of wood. That night the standing\r\ntimbers were attacked by thousands of prisoners armed with every\r\nspecies of a tool to cut wood, from a case-knife to an ax. They worked\r\nthe live-long night with such energy that by morning not only every\r\ninch of the logs above ground had disappeared, but that below had been\r\ndug up, and there was not enough left of the eight hundred foot wall of\r\ntwenty-five-foot logs to make a box of matches.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon--early in August--one of the violent rain storms\r\ncommon to that section sprung up, and in a little while the water\r\nwas falling in torrents. The little creek running through the camp\r\nswelled up immensely, and swept out large gaps in the Stockade, both\r\nin the west and east sides. The Rebels noticed the breaches as soon\r\nas the prisoners. Two guns were fired from the Star Tort, and all the\r\nguards rushed out, and formed so as to prevent any egress, if one was\r\nattempted. Taken by surprise, we were not in a condition to profit by\r\nthe opportunity until it was too late.\r\n\r\nThe storm did one good thing: it swept away a great deal of filth, and\r\nleft the camp much more wholesome. The foul stench rising from the\r\ncamp made an excellent electrical conductor, and the lightning struck\r\nseveral times within one hundred feet of the prison.\r\n\r\nToward the end of August there happened what the religously inclined\r\ntermed a Providential Dispensation. The water in the Creek was\r\nindescribably bad. No amount of familiarity with it, no increase of\r\nintimacy with our offensive surroundings, could lessen the disgust\r\nat the polluted water. As I have said previously, before the stream\r\nentered the Stockade, it was rendered too filthy for any use by the\r\ncontaminations from the camps of the guards, situated about a half-mile\r\nabove. Immediately on entering the Stockade the contamination became\r\nterrible. The oozy seep at the bottom of the hillsides drained directly\r\ninto it all the mass of filth from a population of thirty-three\r\nthousand. Imagine the condition of an open sewer, passing through the\r\nheart of a city of that many people, and receiving all the offensive\r\nproduct of so dense a gathering into a shallow, sluggish stream, a yard\r\nwide and five inches deep, and heated by the burning rays of the sun\r\nin the thirty-second degree of latitude. Imagine, if one can, without\r\nbecoming sick at the stomach, all of these people having to wash in and\r\ndrink of this foul flow.\r\n\r\nThere is not a scintilla of exaggeration in this statement. That\r\nit is within the exact truth is demonstrable by the testimony of\r\nany man--Rebel or Union--who ever saw the inside of the Stockade at\r\nAndersonville. I am quite content to have its truth--as well as that of\r\nany other statement made in this book--be determined by the evidence\r\nof any one, no matter how bitter his hatred of the Union, who had any\r\npersonal knowledge of the condition of affairs at Andersonville. No one\r\ncan successfully deny that there were at least thirty-three thousand\r\nprisoners in the Stockade, and that the one shallow, narrow creek,\r\nwhich passed through the prison, was at once their main sewer and their\r\nsource of supply of water for bathing, drinking and washing. With these\r\nmain facts admitted, the reader’s common sense of natural consequences\r\nwill furnish the rest of the details.\r\n\r\nIt is true that some of the more fortunate of us had wells; thanks to\r\nour own energy in overcoming extraordinary obstacles; no thanks to our\r\ngaolers for making the slightest effort to provide these necessities\r\nof life. We dug the wells with case and pocket knives, and half\r\ncanteens to a depth of from twenty to thirty feet, pulling up the dirt\r\nin pantaloons legs, and running continual risk of being smothered to\r\ndeath by the caving in of the unwalled sides. Not only did the Rebels\r\nrefuse to give us boards with which to wall the wells, and buckets for\r\ndrawing the water, but they did all in their power to prevent us from\r\ndigging the wells, and made continual forays to capture the digging\r\ntools, because the wells were frequently used as the starting places\r\nfor tunnels. Professor Jones lays special stress on this tunnel feature\r\nin his testimony, which I have introduced in a previous chapter.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of the prisoners who went to the Creek for water,\r\nwent as near as possible to the Dead Line on the West Side, where the\r\nCreek entered the Stockade, that they might get water with as little\r\nfilth in it as possible. In the crowds struggling there for their turn\r\nto take a dip, some one nearly every day got so close to the Dead Line\r\nas to arouse a suspicion in the guard’s mind that he was touching it.\r\nThe suspicion was the unfortunate one’s death warrant, and also its\r\nexecution. As the sluggish brain of the guard conceived it he leveled\r\nhis gun; the distance to his victim was not over one hundred feet;\r\nhe never failed his aim; the first warning the wretched prisoner got\r\nthat he was suspected of transgressing a prison-rule was the charge of\r\n“ball-and-buck” that tore through his body. It was lucky if he was, the\r\nonly one of the group killed. More wicked and unjustifiable murders\r\nnever were committed than these almost daily assassinations at the\r\nCreek.\r\n\r\nOne morning the camp was astonished beyond measure to discover that\r\nduring the night a large, bold spring had burst out on the North\r\nSide, about midway between the Swamp and the summit of the hill. It\r\npoured out its grateful flood of pure, sweet water in an apparently\r\nexhaustless quantity. To the many who looked in wonder upon it, it\r\nseemed as truly a heaven-wrought miracle as when Moses’s enchanted rod\r\nsmote the parched rock in Sinai’s desert waste, and the living waters\r\ngushed forth.\r\n\r\nThe police took charge of the spring, and every one was compelled to\r\ntake his regular turn in filling his vessel. This was kept up during\r\nour whole stay in Andersonville, and every morning, shortly after\r\ndaybreak, a thousand men could be seen standing in line, waiting their\r\nturns to fill their cans and cups with the precious liquid.\r\n\r\nI am told by comrades who have revisited the Stockade of recent years,\r\nthat the spring is yet running as when we left, and is held in most\r\npious veneration by the negros of that vicinity, who still preserve the\r\ntradition of its miraculous origin, and ascribe to its water wonderful\r\ngrace giving and healing properties, similar to those which pious\r\nCatholics believe exist in the holy water of the fountain at Lourdes.\r\n\r\nI must confess that I do not think they are so very far from right. If\r\nI could believe that any water was sacred and thaumaturgic, it would\r\nbe of that fountain which appeared so opportunely for the benefit of\r\nthe perishing thousands of Andersonville. And when I hear of people\r\nbringing water for baptismal purposes from the Jordan, I say in\r\nmy heart, “How much more would I value for myself and friends the\r\nadministration of the chrismal sacrament with the diviner flow from\r\nthat low sand-hill in Western Georgia.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\n“SICK CALL,” AND THE SCENES THAT ACCOMPANIED IT--MUSTERING THE LAME,\r\nHALT AND DISEASED AT THE SOUTH GATE--AN UNUSUALLY BAD CASE--GOING OUT\r\nTO THE HOSPITAL--ACCOMMODATION AND TREATMENT OF THE PATIENTS THERE--THE\r\nHORRIBLE SUFFERING IN THE GANGRENE WARD--BUNGLING AMPUTATIONS\r\nBY BLUNDERING PRACTITIONERS--AFFECTION BETWEEN A SAILOR AND HIS\r\nWARD--DEATH OF MY COMRADE.\r\n\r\nEvery morning after roll-call, thousands of sick gathered at the South\r\nGate, where the doctors made some pretense of affording medical relief.\r\nThe scene there reminded me of the illustrations in my Sunday-School\r\nlessons of that time when “great multitudes came unto Him,” by the\r\nshores of the Sea of Galilee, “having with them those that were\r\nlame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others.” Had the crowds worn the\r\nflouting robes of the East, the picture would have lacked nothing\r\nbut the presence of the Son of Man to make it complete. Here were\r\nthe burning sands and parching sun; hither came scores of groups of\r\nthree or four comrades, laboriously staggering under the weight of a\r\nblanket in which they had carried a disabled and dying friend from some\r\ndistant part of the Stockade. Beside them hobbled the scorbutics with\r\nswollen and distorted limbs, each more loathsome and nearer death than\r\nthe lepers whom Christ’s divine touch made whole. Dozens, unable to\r\nwalk, and having no comrades to carry them, crawled painfully along,\r\nwith frequent stops, on their hands and knees. Every form of intense\r\nphysical suffering that it is possible for disease to induce in the\r\nhuman frame was visible at these daily parades of the sick of the\r\nprison. As over three thousand (three thousand and seventy-six) died\r\nin August, there were probably twelve thousand dangerously sick at any\r\ngiven time daring the month; and a large part of these collected at the\r\nSouth Gate every morning.\r\n\r\nMeasurably-calloused as we had become by the daily sights of horror\r\naround us, we encountered spectacles in these gatherings which\r\nno amount of visible misery could accustom us to. I remember one\r\nespecially that burned itself deeply into my memory. It was of a young\r\nman not over twenty-five, who a few weeks ago--his clothes looked\r\ncomparatively new --had evidently been the picture of manly beauty\r\nand youthful vigor. He had had a well-knit, lithe form; dark curling\r\nhair fell over a forehead which had once been fair, and his eyes still\r\nshowed that they had gleamed with a bold, adventurous spirit. The red\r\nclover leaf on his cap showed that he belonged to the First Division of\r\nthe Second Corps, the three chevrons on his arm that he was a Sergeant,\r\nand the stripe at his cuff that he was a veteran. Some kind-hearted\r\nboys had found him in a miserable condition on the North Side, and\r\ncarried him over in a blanket to where the doctors could see him. He\r\nhad but little clothing on, save his blouse and cap. Ulcers of some\r\nkind had formed in his abdomen, and these were now masses of squirming\r\nworms. It was so much worse than the usual forms of suffering, that\r\nquite a little crowd of compassionate spectators gathered around and\r\nexpressed their pity. The sufferer turned to one who lay beside him\r\nwith:\r\n\r\n“Comrade: If we were only under the old Stars and Stripes, we wouldn’t\r\ncare a G-d d--n for a few worms, would we?”\r\n\r\nThis was not profane. It was an utterance from the depths of a brave\r\nman’s heart, couched in the strongest language at his command. It\r\nseemed terrible that so gallant a soul should depart from earth in this\r\nmiserable fashion. Some of us, much moved by the sight, went to the\r\ndoctors and put the case as strongly as possible, begging them to do\r\nsomething to alleviate his suffering. They declined to see the case,\r\nbut got rid of us by giving us a bottle of turpentine, with directions\r\nto pour it upon the ulcers to kill the maggots. We did so. It must have\r\nbeen cruel torture, and as absurd remedially as cruel, but our hero set\r\nhis teeth and endured, without a groan. He was then carried out to the\r\nhospital to die.\r\n\r\nI said the doctors made a pretense of affording medical relief. It was\r\nhardly that, since about all the prescription for those inside the\r\nStockade consisted in giving a handful of sumach berries to each of\r\nthose complaining of scurvy. The berries might have done some good, had\r\nthere been enough of them, and had their action been assisted by proper\r\nfood. As it was, they were probably nearly, if not wholly, useless.\r\nNothing was given to arrest the ravages of dysentery.\r\n\r\nA limited number of the worst cases were admitted to the Hospital\r\neach day. As this only had capacity for about one-quarter of the sick\r\nin the Stockade, new patients could only be admitted as others died.\r\nIt seemed, anyway, like signing a man’s death warrant to send him to\r\nthe Hospital, as three out of every four who went out there died. The\r\nfollowing from the official report of the Hospital shows this:\r\n\r\nTotal number admitted .........................................12,900\r\nDied ................................................. 8,663\r\nExchanged ............................................ 828\r\nTook the oath of allegiance .......................... 25\r\nSent elsewhere ....................................... 2,889\r\n\r\nTotal ................................................12,400\r\n\r\nAverage deaths, 76 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in August I made a successful effort to get out to the Hospital.\r\nI had several reasons for this: First, one of my chums, W. W. Watts,\r\nof my own company, had been sent out a little whale before very sick\r\nwith scurvy and pneumonia, and I wanted to see if I could do anything\r\nfor him, if he still lived: I have mentioned before that for awhile\r\nafter our entrance into Andersonville five of us slept on one overcoat\r\nand covered ourselves with one blanket. Two of these had already died,\r\nleaving as possessors of-the blanket and overcoat, W. W. Watts, B. B.\r\nAndrews, and myself.\r\n\r\nNext, I wanted to go out to see if there was any prospect of escape. I\r\nhad long since given up hopes of escaping from the Stockade. All our\r\nattempts at tunneling had resulted in dead failures, and now, to make\r\nus wholly despair of success in that direction, another Stockade was\r\nbuilt clear around the prison, at a distance of one hundred and twenty\r\nfeet from the first palisades. It was manifest that though we might\r\nsucceed in tunneling past one Stockade, we could not go beyond the\r\nsecond one.\r\n\r\nI had the scurvy rather badly, and being naturally slight in frame, I\r\npresented a very sick appearance to the physicians, and was passed out\r\nto the Hospital.\r\n\r\nWhile this was a wretched affair, it was still a vast improvement on\r\nthe Stockade. About five acres of ground, a little southeast of the\r\nStockade, and bordering on a creek, were enclosed by a board fence,\r\naround which the guard walked, trees shaded the ground tolerably well.\r\nThere were tents and flies to shelter part of the sick, and in these\r\nwere beds made of pine leaves. There were regular streets and alleys\r\nrunning through the grounds, and as the management was in the hands\r\nof our own men, the place was kept reasonably clean and orderly for\r\nAndersonville.\r\n\r\nThere was also some improvement in the food. Rice in some degree\r\nreplaced the nauseous and innutritious corn bread, and if served in\r\nsufficient quantities, would doubtless have promoted the recovery\r\nof many men dying from dysenteric diseases. We also received small\r\nquantities of “okra,” a plant peculiar to the South, whose pods\r\ncontained a mucilaginous matter that made a soup very grateful to those\r\nsuffering from scurvy.\r\n\r\nBut all these ameliorations of condition were too slight to even arrest\r\nthe progress of the disease of the thousands of dying men brought out\r\nfrom the Stockade. These still wore the same lice-infested garments as\r\nin prison; no baths or even ordinary applications of soap and water\r\ncleaned their dirt-grimed skins, to give their pores an opportunity\r\nto assist in restoring them to health; even their long, lank and\r\nmatted hair, swarming with vermin, was not trimmed. The most ordinary\r\nand obvious measures for their comfort and care were neglected. If a\r\nman recovered he did it almost in spite of fate. The medicines given\r\nwere scanty and crude. The principal remedial agent--as far as my\r\nobservation extended--was a rank, fetid species of unrectified spirits,\r\nwhich, I was told, was made from sorgum seed. It had a light-green\r\ntinge, and was about as inviting to the taste as spirits of turpentine.\r\nIt was given to the sick in small quantities mixed with water. I had\r\nhad some experience with Kentucky “apple-jack,” which, it was popularly\r\nbelieved among the boys, would dissolve a piece of the fattest pork\r\nthrown into it, but that seemed balmy and oily alongside of this.\r\nAfter tasting some, I ceased to wonder at the atrocities of Wirz and\r\nhis associates. Nothing would seem too bad to a man who made that his\r\nhabitual tipple.\r\n\r\n[For a more particular description of the Hospital I must refer my\r\nreader to the testimony of Professor Jones, in a previous chapter.]\r\n\r\nCertainly this continent has never seen--and I fervently trust it\r\nwill never again see--such a gigantic concentration of misery as that\r\nHospital displayed daily. The official statistics tell the story of\r\nthis with terrible brevity: There were three thousand seven hundred\r\nand nine in the Hospital in August; one thousand four hundred and\r\neighty-nine--nearly every other man died. The rate afterwards became\r\nmuch higher than this.\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous suffering was in the gangrene wards. Horrible\r\nsores spreading almost visibly from hour to hour, devoured men’s limbs\r\nand bodies. I remember one ward in which the alterations appeared to be\r\naltogether in the back, where they ate out the tissue between the skin\r\nand the ribs. The attendants seemed trying to arrest the progress of\r\nthe sloughing by drenching the sores with a solution of blue vitriol.\r\nThis was exquisitely painful, and in the morning, when the drenching\r\nwas going on, the whole hospital rang with the most agonizing screams.\r\n\r\nBut the gangrene mostly attacked the legs and arms, and the led more\r\nthan the arms. Sometimes it killed men inside of a week; sometimes they\r\nlingered on indefinitely. I remember one man in the Stockade who cut\r\nhis hand with the sharp corner of a card of corn bread he was lifting\r\nfrom the ration wagon; gangrene set in immediately, and he died four\r\ndays after.\r\n\r\nOne form that was quit prevalent was a cancer of the lower one corner\r\nof the mouth, and it finally ate the whole side of the face out. Of\r\ncourse the sufferer had the greatest trouble in eating and drinking.\r\nFor the latter it was customary to whittle out a little wooden tube,\r\nand fasten it in a tin cup, through which he could suck up the water.\r\nAs this mouth cancer seemed contagious, none of us would allow any one\r\nafflicted with it to use any of our cooking utensils. The Rebel doctors\r\nat the hospital resorted to wholesale amputations to check the progress\r\nof the gangrene.\r\n\r\nThey had a two hours session of limb-lopping every morning, each of\r\nwhich resulted in quite a pile of severed members. I presume more\r\nbungling operations are rarely seen outside of Russian or Turkish\r\nhospitals. Their unskilfulness was apparent even to non-scientific\r\nobservers like myself. The standard of medical education in the\r\nSouth--as indeed of every other form of education--was quite low. The\r\nChief Surgeon of the prison, Dr. Isaiah White, and perhaps two or three\r\nothers, seemed to be gentlemen of fair abilities and attainments. The\r\nremainder were of that class of illiterate and unlearning quacks who\r\nphysic and blister the poor whites and negros in the country districts\r\nof the South; who believe they can stop bleeding of the nose by\r\nrepeating a verse from the Bible; who think that if in gathering their\r\nfavorite remedy of boneset they cut the stem upwards it will purge\r\ntheir patients, and if downward it will vomit them, and who hold that\r\nthere is nothing so good for “fits” as a black cat, killed in the dark\r\nof the moon, cut open, and bound while yet warm, upon the naked chest\r\nof the victim of the convulsions.\r\n\r\nThey had a case of instruments captured from some of our field\r\nhospitals, which were dull and fearfully out of order. With poor\r\ninstruments and unskilled hands the operations became mangling.\r\n\r\nIn the Hospital I saw an admirable illustration of the affection\r\nwhich a sailor will lavish on a ship’s boy, whom he takes a fancy to,\r\nand makes his “chicken,” as the phrase is. The United States sloop\r\n“Water Witch” had recently been captured in Ossabaw Sound, and her\r\ncrew brought into prison. One of her boys--a bright, handsome little\r\nfellow of about fifteen--had lost one of his arms in the fight. He\r\nwas brought into the Hospital, and the old fellow whose “chicken” he\r\nwas, was allowed to accompany and nurse him. This “old barnacle-back”\r\nwas as surly a growler as ever went aloft, but to his “chicken” he\r\nwas as tender and thoughtful as a woman. They found a shady nook in\r\none corner, and any moment one looked in that direction he could see\r\nthe old tar hard at work at something for the comfort and pleasure\r\nof his pet. Now he was dressing the wound as deftly and gently as a\r\nmother caring for a new-born babe; now he was trying to concoct some\r\nrelish out of the slender materials he could beg or steal from the\r\nQuartermaster; now trying to arrange the shade of the bed of pine\r\nleaves in a more comfortable manner; now repairing or washing his\r\nclothes, and so on.\r\n\r\nAll the sailors were particularly favored by being allowed to bring\r\ntheir bags in untouched by the guards. This “chicken” had a wonderful\r\nsupply of clothes, the handiwork of his protector who, like most good\r\nsailors, was very skillful with the needle. He had suits of fine white\r\nduck, embroidered with blue in a way that would ravish the heart of a\r\nfine lady, and blue suits similarly embroidered with white. No belle\r\never kept her clothes in better order than these were. When the duck\r\ncame up from the old sailor’s patient washing it was as spotless as\r\nnew-fallen snow.\r\n\r\nI found my chum in a very bad condition. His appetite was entirely\r\ngone, but he had an inordinate craving for tobacco--for strong, black\r\nplug --which he smoked in a pipe. He had already traded off all his\r\nbrass buttons to the guards for this. I had accumulated a few buttons\r\nto bribe the guard to take me out for wood, and I gave these also\r\nfor tobacco for him. When I awoke one morning the man who laid next\r\nto me on the right was dead, having died sometime during the night.\r\nI searched his pockets and took what was in them. These were a silk\r\npocket handkerchief, a gutta percha finger-ring, a comb, a pencil, and\r\na leather pocket-book, making in all quite a nice little “find.” I hied\r\nover to the guard, and succeeded in trading the personal estate which\r\nI had inherited from the intestate deceased, for a handful of peaches,\r\na handful of hardly ripe figs, and a long plug of tobacco. I hastened\r\nback to Watts, expecting that the figs and peaches would do him a world\r\nof good. At first I did not show him the tobacco, as I was strongly\r\nopposed to his using it, thinking that it was making him much worse.\r\nBut he looked at the tempting peaches and figs with lack-luster eyes;\r\nhe was too far gone to care for them. He pushed them back to me, saying\r\nfaintly:\r\n\r\n“No, you take ’em, Mc; I don’t want ’em; I can’t eat ’em!”\r\n\r\nI then produced the tobacco, and his face lighted up. Concluding that\r\nthis was all the comfort that he could have, and that I might as well\r\ngratify him, I cut up some of the weed, filled his pipe and lighted it.\r\nHe smoked calmly and almost happily all the afternoon, hardly speaking\r\na word to me. As it grew dark he asked me to bring him a drink. I did\r\nso, and as I raised him up he said:\r\n\r\n“Mc, this thing’s ended. Tell my father that I stood it as long as I\r\ncould, and----”\r\n\r\nThe death rattle sounded in his throat, and when I laid him back it was\r\nall over. Straightening out his limbs, folding his hands across his\r\nbreast, and composing his features as best I could, I lay, down beside\r\nthe body and slept till morning, when I did what little else I could\r\ntoward preparing for the grave all that was left of my long-suffering\r\nlittle friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION TO ESCAPE--DIFFERENT PLANS AND THEIR MERITS--I PREFER THE\r\nAPPALACHICOLA ROUTE--PREPARATIONS FOR DEPARTURE--A HOT DAY--THE FENCE\r\nPASSED SUCCESSFULLY PURSUED BY THE HOUNDS--CAUGHT --RETURNED TO THE\r\nSTOCKADE.\r\n\r\nAfter Watt’s death, I set earnestly about seeing what could be done in\r\nthe way of escape. Frank Harney, of the First West Virginia Cavalry, a\r\nboy of about my own age and disposition, joined with me in the scheme.\r\nI was still possessed with my original plan of making my way down the\r\ncreeks to the Flint River, down the Flint River to where it emptied\r\ninto the Appalachicola River, and down that stream to its debauchure\r\ninto the bay that connected with the Gulf of Mexico. I was sure of\r\nfinding my way by this route, because, if nothing else offered, I could\r\nget astride of a log and float down the current. The way to Sherman,\r\nin the other direction, was long, torturous and difficult, with a\r\nfearful gauntlet of blood-hounds, patrols and the scouts of Hood’s Army\r\nto be run. I had but little difficulty in persuading Harney into an\r\nacceptance of my views, and we began arranging for a solution of the\r\nfirst great problem--how to get outside of the Hospital guards. As I\r\nhave explained before, the Hospital was surrounded by a board fence,\r\nwith guards walking their beats on the ground outside. A small creek\r\nflowed through the southern end of the grounds, and at its lower end\r\nwas used as a sink. The boards of the fence came down to the surface\r\nof the water, where the Creek passed out, but we found, by careful\r\nprodding with a stick, that the hole between the boards and the bottom\r\nof the Creek was sufficiently large to allow the passage of our bodies,\r\nand there had been no stakes driven or other precautions used to\r\nprevent egress by this channel. A guard was posted there, and probably\r\nordered to stand at the edge of the stream, but it smelled so vilely in\r\nthose scorching days that he had consulted his feelings and probably\r\nhis health, by retiring to the top of the bank, a rod or more distant.\r\nWe watched night after night, and at last were gratified to find that\r\nnone went nearer the Creak than the top of this bank.\r\n\r\nThen we waited for the moon to come right, so that the first part\r\nof the night should be dark. This took several days, but at last we\r\nknew that the next night she would not rise until between 9 and 10\r\no’clock, which would give us nearly two hours of the dense darkness of\r\na moonless Summer night in the South. We had first thought of saving\r\nup some rations for the trip, but then reflected that these would be\r\nruined by the filthy water into which we must sink to go under the\r\nfence. It was not difficult to abandon the food idea, since it was very\r\nhard to force ourselves to lay by even the smallest portion of our\r\nscanty rations.\r\n\r\nAs the next day wore on, our minds were wrought up into exalted tension\r\nby the rapid approach of the supreme moment, with all its chances\r\nand consequences. The experience of the past few months was not such\r\nas to mentally fit us for such a hazard. It prepared us for sullen,\r\nuncomplaining endurance, for calmly contemplating the worst that could\r\ncome; but it did not strengthen that fiber of mind that leads to\r\nventuresome activity and daring exploits. Doubtless the weakness of our\r\nbodies reacted upon our spirits. We contemplated all the perils that\r\nconfronted us; perils that, now looming up with impending nearness,\r\ntook a clearer and more threatening shape than they had ever done\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nWe considered the desperate chances of passing the guard unseen; or,\r\nif noticed, of escaping his fire without death or severe wounds. But\r\nsupposing him fortunately evaded, then came the gauntlet of the hounds\r\nand the patrols hunting deserters. After this, a long, weary journey,\r\nwith bare feet and almost naked bodies, through an unknown country\r\nabounding with enemies; the dangers of assassination by the embittered\r\npopulace; the risks of dying with hunger and fatigue in the gloomy\r\ndepths of a swamp; the scanty hopes that, if we reached the seashore,\r\nwe could get to our vessels.\r\n\r\nNot one of all these contingencies failed to expand itself to all its\r\nalarming proportions, and unite with its fellows to form a dreadful\r\nvista, like the valleys filled with demons and genii, dragons and\r\nmalign enchantments, which confront the heros of the “Arabian Nights,”\r\nwhen they set out to perform their exploits.\r\n\r\nBut behind us lay more miseries and horrors than a riotous imagination\r\ncould conceive; before us could certainly be nothing worse. We would\r\nput life and freedom to the hazard of a touch, and win or lose it all.\r\n\r\nThe day had been intolerably hot. The sun’s rays seemed to sear the\r\nearth, like heated irons, and the air that lay on the burning sand was\r\nbroken by wavy lines, such as one sees indicate the radiation from a\r\nhot stove.\r\n\r\nExcept the wretched chain-gang plodding torturously back and forward on\r\nthe hillside, not a soul nor an animal could be seen in motion outside\r\nthe Stockade. The hounds were panting in their kennel; the Rebel\r\nofficers, half or wholly drunken with villainous sorgum whisky, were\r\nstretched at full length in the shade at headquarters; the half-caked\r\ngunners crouched under the shadow of the embankments of the forts, the\r\nguards hung limply over the Stockade in front of their little perches;\r\nthe thirty thousand boys inside the Stockade, prone or supine upon\r\nthe glowing sand, gasped for breath--for one draft of sweet, cool,\r\nwholesome air that did not bear on its wings the subtle seeds of rank\r\ncorruption and death. Everywhere was the prostration of discomfort--the\r\ninertia of sluggishness.\r\n\r\nOnly the sick moved; only the pain-racked cried out; only the dying\r\nstruggled; only the agonies of dissolution could make life assert\r\nitself against the exhaustion of the heat.\r\n\r\nHarney and I, lying in the scanty shade of the trunk of a tall pine,\r\nand with hearts filled with solicitude as to the outcome of what the\r\nevening would bring us, looked out over the scene as we had done daily\r\nfor long months, and remained silent for hours, until the sun, as if\r\nweary with torturing and slaying, began going down in the blazing West.\r\nThe groans of the thousands of sick around us, the shrieks of the\r\nrotting ones in the gangrene wards rang incessantly in our ears.\r\n\r\nAs the sun disappeared, and the heat abated, the suspended activity\r\nwas restored. The Master of the Hounds came out with his yelping pack,\r\nand started on his rounds; the Rebel officers aroused themselves from\r\ntheir siesta and went lazily about their duties; the fifer produced\r\nhis cracked fife and piped forth his unvarying “Bonnie Blue Flag,”\r\nas a signal for dress parade, and drums beaten by unskilled hands in\r\nthe camps of the different regiments, repeated the signal. In time\r\nStockade the mass of humanity became full of motion as an ant hill, and\r\nresembled it very much from our point of view, with the boys threading\r\ntheir way among the burrows, tents and holes.\r\n\r\nIt was becoming dark quite rapidly. The moments seemed galloping onward\r\ntoward the time when we must make the decisive step. We drew from the\r\ndirty rag in which it was wrapped the little piece of corn bread that\r\nwe had saved for our supper, carefully divided it into two equal parts,\r\nand each took one and ate it in silence. This done, we held a final\r\nconsultation as to our plans, and went over each detail carefully, that\r\nwe might fully understand each other under all possible circumstances,\r\nand act in concert. One point we laboriously impressed upon each other,\r\nand that was; that under no circumstances were we to allow ourselves\r\nto be tempted to leave the Creek until we reached its junction with\r\nthe Flint River. I then picked up two pine leaves, broke them off to\r\nunequal lengths, rolled them in my hands behind my back for a second,\r\nand presenting them to Harney with their ends sticking out of my closed\r\nhand, said:\r\n\r\n“The one that gets the longest one goes first.”\r\n\r\nHarney reached forth and drew the longer one.\r\n\r\nWe made a tour of reconnaissance. Everything seemed as usual, and\r\nwonderfully calm compared with the tumult in our minds. The Hospital\r\nguards were pacing their beats lazily; those on the Stockade were\r\ndrawling listlessly the first “call around” of the evening:\r\n\r\n“Post numbah foah! Half-past seven o’clock! and a-l-l’s we-l-ll!”\r\n\r\nInside the Stockade was a Babel of sounds, above all of which rose the\r\nmelody of religious and patriotic songs, sung in various parts of the\r\ncamp. From the headquarters came the shouts and laughter of the Rebel\r\nofficers having a little “frolic” in the cool of the evening. The\r\ngroans of the sick around us were gradually hushing, as the abatement\r\nof the terrible heat let all but the worst cases sink into a brief\r\nslumber, from which they awoke before midnight to renew their outcries.\r\nBut those in the Gangrene wards seemed to be denied even this scanty\r\nblessing. Apparently they never slept, for their shrieks never ceased.\r\nA multitude of whip-poor-wills in the woods around us began their usual\r\ndismal cry, which had never seemed so unearthly and full of dreadful\r\npresages as now.\r\n\r\nIt was, now quite dark, and we stole noiselessly down to the Creek\r\nand reconnoitered. We listened. The guard was not pacing his beat, as\r\nwe could not hear his footsteps. A large, ill-shapen lump against the\r\ntrunk of one of the trees on the bank showed that he was leaning there\r\nresting himself. We watched him for several minutes, but he did not\r\nmove, and the thought shot into our minds that he might be asleep; but\r\nit seemed impossible: it was too early in the evening.\r\n\r\nNow, if ever, was the opportunity. Harney squeezed my hand, stepped\r\nnoiselessly into the Creek, laid himself gently down into the filthy\r\nwater, and while my heart was beating so that I was certain it could\r\nbe heard some distance from me, began making toward the fence. He\r\npassed under easily, and I raised my eyes toward the guard, while on my\r\nstrained ear fell the soft plashing made by Harney as he pulled himself\r\ncautiously forward. It seemed as if the sentinel must hear this; he\r\ncould not help it, and every second I expected to see the black lump\r\naddress itself to motion, and the musket flash out fiendishly. But he\r\ndid not; the lump remained motionless; the musket silent.\r\n\r\nWhen I thought that Harney had gained a sufficient distance I followed.\r\nIt seemed as if the disgusting water would smother me as I laid myself\r\ndown into it, and such was my agitation that it appeared almost\r\nimpossible that I should escape making such a noise as would attract\r\nthe guard’s notice. Catching hold of the roots and limbs at the side\r\nof the stream, I pulled myself slowly along, and as noiselessly as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nI passed under the fence without difficulty, and was outside, and\r\nwithin fifteen feet of the guard. I had lain down into the creek upon\r\nmy right side, that my face might be toward the guard, and I could\r\nwatch him closely all the time.\r\n\r\nAs I came under the fence he was still leaning motionless against the\r\ntree, but to my heated imagination he appeared to have turned and be\r\nwatching me. I hardly breathed; the filthy water rippling past me\r\nseemed to roar to attract the guard’s attention; I reached my hand out\r\ncautiously to grasp a root to pull myself along by, and caught instead\r\na dry branch, which broke with a loud crack. My heart absolutely stood\r\nstill. The guard evidently heard the noise. The black lump separated\r\nitself from the tree, and a straight line which I knew to be his musket\r\nseparated itself from the lump. In a brief instant I lived a year of\r\nmortal apprehension. So certain was I that he had discovered me, and\r\nwas leveling his piece to fire, that I could scarcely restrain myself\r\nfrom springing up and dashing away to avoid the shot. Then I heard him\r\ntake a step, and to my unutterable surprise and relief, he walked off\r\nfarther from the Creek, evidently to speak to the man whose beat joined\r\nhis.\r\n\r\nI pulled away more swiftly, but still with the greatest caution, until\r\nafter half-an-hour’s painful effort I had gotten fully one hundred and\r\nfifty yards away from the Hospital fence, and found Harney crouched on\r\na cypress knee, close to the water’s edge, watching for me.\r\n\r\nWe waited there a few minutes, until I could rest, and calm my\r\nperturbed nerves down to something nearer their normal equilibrium, and\r\nthen started on. We hoped that if we were as lucky in our next step as\r\nin the first one we would reach the Flint River by daylight, and have a\r\ngood long start before the morning roll-call revealed our absence. We\r\ncould hear the hounds still baying in the distance, but this sound was\r\ntoo customary to give us any uneasiness.\r\n\r\nBut our progress was terribly slow. Every step hurt fearfully. The\r\nCreek bed was full of roots and snags, and briers, and vines trailed\r\nacross it. These caught and tore our bare feet and legs, rendered\r\nabnormally tender by the scurvy. It seemed as if every step was marked\r\nwith blood. The vines tripped us, and we frequently fell headlong. We\r\nstruggled on determinedly for nearly an hour, and were perhaps a mile\r\nfrom the Hospital.\r\n\r\nThe moon came up, and its light showed that the creek continued its\r\ncourse through a dense jungle like that we had been traversing,\r\nwhile on the high ground to our left were the open pine woods I have\r\npreviously described.\r\n\r\nWe stopped and debated for a few minutes. We recalled our promise to\r\nkeep in the Creek, the experience of other boys who had tried to escape\r\nand been caught by the hounds. If we staid in the Creek we were sure\r\nthe hounds would not find our trail, but it was equally certain that at\r\nthis rate we would be exhausted and starved before we got out of sight\r\nof the prison. It seemed that we had gone far enough to be out of reach\r\nof the packs patrolling immediately around the Stockade, and there\r\ncould be but little risk in trying a short walk on the dry ground. We\r\nconcluded to take the chances, and, ascending the bank, we walked and\r\nran as fast as we could for about two miles further.\r\n\r\nAll at once it struck me that with all our progress the hounds sounded\r\nas near as when we started. I shivered at the thought, and though\r\nnearly ready to drop with fatigue, urged myself and Harney on.\r\n\r\nAn instant later their baying rang out on the still night air right\r\nbehind us, and with fearful distinctness. There was no mistake now;\r\nthey had found our trail, and were running us down. The change from\r\nfearful apprehension to the crushing reality stopped us stock-still in\r\nour tracks.\r\n\r\nAt the next breath the hounds came bursting through the woods in plain\r\nsight, and in full cry. We obeyed our first impulse; rushed back into\r\nthe swamp, forced our way for a few yards through the flesh-tearing\r\nimpediments, until we gained a large cypress, upon whose great knees\r\nwe climbed--thoroughly exhausted--just as the yelping pack reached the\r\nedge of the water, and stopped there and bayed at us. It was a physical\r\nimpossibility for us to go another step.\r\n\r\nIn a moment the low-browed villain who had charge of the hounds came\r\ngalloping up on his mule, tooting signals to his dogs as he came, on\r\nthe cow-horn slung from his shoulders.\r\n\r\nHe immediately discovered us, covered us with his revolver, and yelled\r\nout:\r\n\r\n“Come ashore, there, quick: you---- ---- ---- ----s!”\r\n\r\nThere was no help for it. We climbed down off the knees and started\r\ntowards the land. As we neared it, the hounds became almost frantic,\r\nand it seemed as if we would be torn to pieces the moment they could\r\nreach us. But the master dismounted and drove them back. He was surly\r\n--even savage--to us, but seemed in too much hurry to get back to waste\r\nany time annoying us with the dogs. He ordered us to get around in\r\nfront of the mule, and start back to camp. We moved as rapidly as our\r\nfatigue and our lacerated feet would allow us, and before midnight were\r\nagain in the hospital, fatigued, filthy, torn, bruised and wretched\r\nbeyond description or conception.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we were turned back into the Stockade as punishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nAUGUST--GOOD LUCK IN NOT MEETING CAPTAIN WIRZ--THAT WORTHY’S TREATMENT\r\nOF RECAPTURED PRISONERS--SECRET SOCIETIES IN PRISON--SINGULAR MEETING\r\nAND ITS RESULT--DISCOVERY AND REMOVAL OF THE OFFICERS AMONG THE\r\nENLISTED MEN.\r\n\r\nHarney and I were specially fortunate in being turned back into the\r\nStockade without being brought before Captain Wirz.\r\n\r\nWe subsequently learned that we owed this good luck to Wirz’s absence\r\non sick leave--his place being supplied by Lieutenant Davis, a moderate\r\nbrained Baltimorean, and one of that horde of Marylanders in the Rebel\r\nArmy, whose principal service to the Confederacy consisted in working\r\nthemselves into “bomb-proof” places, and forcing those whom they\r\ndisplaced into the field. Winder was the illustrious head of this crowd\r\nof bomb-proof Rebels from “Maryland, My Maryland!” whose enthusiasm for\r\nthe Southern cause and consistency in serving it only in such places\r\nas were out of range of the Yankee artillery, was the subject of many\r\nbitter jibes by the Rebels--especially by those whose secure berths\r\nthey possessed themselves of.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Davis went into the war with great brashness. He was one of\r\nthe mob which attacked the Sixth Massachusetts in its passage through\r\nBaltimore, but, like all of that class of roughs, he got his stomach\r\nfull of war as soon as the real business of fighting began, and he\r\nretired to where the chances of attaining a ripe old age were better\r\nthan in front of the Army of the Potomac’s muskets. We shall hear of\r\nDavis again.\r\n\r\nEncountering Captain Wirz was one of the terrors of an abortive attempt\r\nto escape. When recaptured prisoners were brought before him he would\r\nfrequently give way to paroxysms of screaming rage, so violent as\r\nto closely verge on insanity. Brandishing the fearful and wonderful\r\nrevolver--of which I have spoken in such a manner as to threaten the\r\nluckless captives with instant death, he would shriek out imprecations,\r\ncurses; and foul epithets in French, German and English, until he\r\nfairly frothed at the mouth. There were plenty of stories current in\r\ncamp of his having several times given away to his rage so far as to\r\nactually shoot men down in these interviews, and still more of his\r\nknocking boys down and jumping upon them, until he inflicted injuries\r\nthat soon resulted in death. How true these rumors were I am unable to\r\nsay of my own personal knowledge, since I never saw him kill any one,\r\nnor have I talked with any one who did. There were a number of cases\r\nof this kind testified to upon his trial, but they all happened among\r\n“paroles” outside the Stockade, or among the prisoners inside after we\r\nleft, so I knew nothing of them.\r\n\r\nOne of the Old Switzer’s favorite ways of ending these seances was to\r\ninform the boys that he would have them shot in an hour or so, and\r\nbid them prepare for death. After keeping them in fearful suspense\r\nfor hours he would order them to be punished with the stocks, the\r\nball-and-chain, the chain-gang, or--if his fierce mood had burned\r\nitself entirely out --as was quite likely with a man of his shallop’\r\nbrain and vacillating temper--to be simply returned to the stockade.\r\n\r\nNothing, I am sure, since the days of the Inquisition--or still later,\r\nsince the terrible punishments visited upon the insurgents of 1848 by\r\nthe Austrian aristocrats--has been so diabolical as the stocks and\r\nchain-gangs, as used by Wirz. At one time seven men, sitting in the\r\nstocks near the Star Fort--in plain view of the camp--became objects\r\nof interest to everybody inside. They were never relieved from their\r\npainful position, but were kept there until all of them died. I think\r\nit was nearly two weeks before the last one succumbed. What they\r\nendured in that time even imagination cannot conceive--I do not think\r\nthat an Indian tribe ever devised keener torture for its captives.\r\n\r\nThe chain-gang consisted of a number of men--varying from twelve to\r\ntwenty-five, all chained to one sixty-four pound ball. They were also\r\nstationed near the Star Fort, standing out in the hot sun, without a\r\nparticle of shade over them. When one moved they all had to move. They\r\nwere scourged with the dysentery, and the necessities of some one of\r\ntheir number kept them constantly in motion. I can see them distinctly\r\nyet, tramping laboriously and painfully back and forward over that\r\nburning hillside, every moment of the long, weary Summer days.\r\n\r\nA comrade writes to remind me of the beneficent work of the Masonic\r\nOrder. I mention it most gladly, as it was the sole recognition on\r\nthe part of any of our foes of our claims to human kinship. The\r\nchurches of all denominations--except the solitary Catholic priest,\r\nFather Hamilton, --ignored us as wholly as if we were dumb beasts.\r\nLay humanitarians were equally indifferent, and the only interest\r\nmanifested by any Rebel in the welfare of any prisoner was by the\r\nMasonic brotherhood. The Rebel Masons interested themselves in securing\r\ndetails outside the Stockade in the cookhouse, the commissary, and\r\nelsewhere, for the brethren among the prisoners who would accept such\r\nfavors. Such as did not feel inclined to go outside on parole received\r\nfrequent presents in the way of food, and especially of vegetables,\r\nwhich were literally beyond price. Materials were sent inside to build\r\ntents for the Masons, and I think such as made themselves known before\r\ndeath, received burial according to the rites of the Order. Doctor\r\nWhite, and perhaps other Surgeons, belonged to the fraternity, and the\r\nwearing of a Masonic emblem by a new prisoner was pretty sure to catch\r\ntheir eyes, and be the means of securing for the wearer the tender\r\nof their good offices, such as a detail into the Hospital as nurse,\r\nward-master, etc.\r\n\r\nI was not fortunate enough to be one of the mystic brethren, and\r\nso missed all share in any of these benefits, as well as in any\r\nothers, and I take special pride in one thing: that during my whole\r\nimprisonment I was not beholden to a Rebel for a single favor of any\r\nkind. The Rebel does not live who can say that he ever gave me so much\r\nas a handful of meal, a spoonful of salt, an inch of thread, or a\r\nstick of wood. From first to last I received nothing but my rations,\r\nexcept occasional trifles that I succeeded in stealing from the stupid\r\nofficers charged with issuing rations. I owe no man in the Southern\r\nConfederacy gratitude for anything--not even for a kind word.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of secret society pins recalls a noteworthy story which has\r\nbeen told me since the war, of boys whom I knew. At the breaking\r\nout of hostilities there existed in Toledo a festive little secret\r\nsociety, such as lurking boys frequently organize, with no other\r\nobject than fun and the usual adolescent love of mystery. There were a\r\ndozen or so members in it who called themselves “The Royal Reubens,”\r\nand were headed by a bookbinder named Ned Hopkins. Some one started\r\na branch of the Order in Napoleon, O., and among the members was\r\nCharles E. Reynolds, of that town. The badge of the society was a\r\npeculiarly shaped gold pin. Reynolds and Hopkins never met, and had no\r\nacquaintance with each other. When the war broke out, Hopkins enlisted\r\nin Battery H, First Ohio Artillery, and was sent to the Army of the\r\nPotomac, where he was captured, in the Fall of 1863, while scouting,\r\nin the neighborhood of Richmond. Reynolds entered the Sixty-Eighth\r\nOhio Volunteer Infantry, and was taken in the neighborhood of Jackson,\r\nMiss.,--two thousand miles from the place of Hopkins’s capture.\r\nAt Andersonville Hopkins became one of the officers in charge of\r\nthe Hospital. One day a Rebel Sergeant, who called the roll in the\r\nStockade, after studying Hopkins’s pin a minute, said:\r\n\r\n“I seed a Yank in the Stockade to-day a-wearing a pin egzackly like\r\nthat ere.”\r\n\r\nThis aroused Hopkins’s interest, and he went inside in search of the\r\nother “feller.” Having his squad and detachment there was little\r\ndifficulty in finding him. He recognized the pin, spoke to its wearer,\r\ngave him the “grand hailing sign” of the “Royal Reubens,” and it was\r\nduly responded to. The upshot of the matter was that he took Reynolds\r\nout with him as clerk, and saved his life, as the latter was going down\r\nhill very rapidly. Reynolds, in turn, secured the detail of a comrade\r\nof the Sixty-Eighth who was failing fast, and succeeded in saving his\r\nlife--all of which happy results were directly attributable to that\r\ninsignificant boyish society, and its equally unimportant badge of\r\nmembership.\r\n\r\nAlong in the last of August the Rebels learned that there were between\r\ntwo and three hundred Captains and Lieutenants in the Stockade, passing\r\nthemselves off as enlisted men. The motive of these officers was\r\ntwo-fold: first, a chivalrous wish to share the fortunes and fate of\r\ntheir boys, and second, disinclination to gratify the Rebels by the\r\nknowledge of the rank of their captives. The secret was so well kept\r\nthat none of us suspected it until the fact was announced by the Rebels\r\nthemselves. They were taken out immediately, and sent to Macon, where\r\nthe commissioned officers’ prison was. It would not do to trust such\r\npossible leaders with us another day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\nFOOD--THE MEAGERNESS, INFERIOR QUALITY, AND TERRIBLE SAMENESS --REBEL\r\nTESTIMONY ON THE SUBJECT--FUTILITY OF SUCCESSFUL EXPLANATION.\r\n\r\nI have in other places dwelt upon the insufficiency and the\r\nnauseousness of the food. No words that I can use, no insistence upon\r\nthis theme, can give the reader any idea of its mortal importance to us.\r\n\r\nLet the reader consider for a moment the quantity, quality, and variety\r\nof food that he now holds to be necessary for the maintenance of life\r\nand health. I trust that every one who peruses this book--that every\r\none in fact over whom the Stars and Stripes wave--has his cup of\r\ncoffee, his biscuits and his beefsteak for breakfast--a substantial\r\ndinner of roast or boiled--and a lighter, but still sufficient meal in\r\nthe evening. In all, certainly not less than fifty different articles\r\nare set before him during the day, for his choice as elements of\r\nnourishment. Let him scan this extended bill-of-fare, which long custom\r\nhas made so common-place as to be uninteresting--perhaps even wearisome\r\nto think about --and see what he could omit from it, if necessity\r\ncompelled him. After a reluctant farewell to fish, butter, eggs, milk,\r\nsugar, green and preserved fruits, etc., he thinks that perhaps under\r\nextraordinary circumstances he might be able to merely sustain life\r\nfor a limited period on a diet of bread and meat three times a day,\r\nwashed down with creamless, unsweetened coffee, and varied occasionally\r\nwith additions of potatos, onions, beans, etc. It would astonish the\r\nInnocent to have one of our veterans inform him that this was not\r\neven the first stage of destitution; that a soldier who had these was\r\nexpected to be on the summit level of contentment. Any of the boys\r\nwho followed Grant to Appomattox Court House, Sherman to the Sea, or\r\n“Pap” Thomas till his glorious career culminated with the annihilation\r\nof Hood, will tell him of many weeks when a slice of fat pork on a\r\npiece of “hard tack” had to do duty for the breakfast of beefsteak and\r\nbiscuits; when another slice of fat pork and another cracker served for\r\nthe dinner of roast beef and vegetables, and a third cracker and slice\r\nof pork was a substitute for the supper of toast and chops.\r\n\r\nI say to these veterans in turn that they did not arrive at the first\r\nstages of destitution compared with the depths to which we were\r\ndragged. The restriction for a few weeks to a diet of crackers and fat\r\npork was certainly a hardship, but the crackers alone, chemists tell\r\nus, contain all the elements necessary to support life, and in our Army\r\nthey were always well made and very palatable. I believe I risk nothing\r\nin saying that one of the ordinary square crackers of our Commissary\r\nDepartment contained much more real nutriment than the whole of our\r\naverage ration.\r\n\r\nI have before compared the size, shape and appearance of the daily half\r\nloaf of corn bread issued to us to a half-brick, and I do not yet know\r\nof a more fitting comparison. At first we got a small piece of rusty\r\nbacon along with this; but the size of this diminished steadily until\r\nat last it faded away entirely, and during the last six months of our\r\nimprisonment I do not believe that we received rations of meat above a\r\nhalf-dozen times.\r\n\r\nTo this smallness was added ineffable badness. The meal was ground\r\nvery coarsely, by dull, weakly propelled stones, that imperfectly\r\ncrushed the grains, and left the tough, hard coating of the kernels in\r\nlarge, sharp, mica-like scales, which cut and inflamed the stomach and\r\nintestines, like handfuls of pounded glass. The alimentary canals of\r\nall compelled to eat it were kept in a continual state of irritation\r\nthat usually terminated in incurable dysentery.\r\n\r\nThat I have not over-stated this evil can be seen by reference to the\r\ntestimony of so competent a scientific observer as Professor Jones, and\r\nI add to that unimpeachable testimony the following extract from the\r\nstatement made in an attempted defense of Andersonville by Doctor R.\r\nRandolph Stevenson, who styles himself, formerly Surgeon in the Army\r\nof the Confederate States of America, Chief Surgeon of the Confederate\r\nStates Military Prison Hospitals, Andersonville, Ga.:\r\n\r\nV. From the sameness of the food, and from the action of the poisonous\r\ngases in the densely crowded and filthy Stockade and Hospital, the\r\nblood was altered in its constitution, even, before the manifestation\r\nof actual disease.\r\n\r\nIn both the well and the sick, the red corpuscles were diminished; and\r\nin all diseases uncomplicated with inflammation, the fibrinous element\r\nwas deficient. In cases of ulceration of the mucous membrane of the\r\nintestinal canal, the fibrinous element of the blood appeared to be\r\nincreased; while in simple diarrhea, uncomplicated with ulceration, and\r\ndependent upon the character of the food and the existence of scurvy,\r\nit was either diminished or remained stationary. Heart-clots were very\r\ncommon, if not universally present, in the cases of ulceration of\r\nthe intestinal mucous membrane; while in the uncomplicated cases of\r\ndiarrhea and scurvy, the blood was fluid and did not coagulate readily,\r\nand the heart-clots and fibrinous concretions were almost universally\r\nabsent. From the watery condition of the blood there resulted various\r\nserous effusions into the pericardium, into the ventricles of the\r\nbrain, and into the abdominal cavity.\r\n\r\nIn almost all cases which I examined after death, even in the most\r\nemaciated, there was more or less serous effusion into the abdominal\r\ncavity. In cases of hospital gangrene of the extremities, and in\r\ncases of gangrene of the intestines, heart-clots and firm coagula\r\nwere universally present. The presence of these clots in the cases of\r\nhospital gangrene, whilst they were absent in the cases in which there\r\nwere no inflammatory symptoms, appears to sustain the conclusion that\r\nhospital gangrene is a species of inflammation (imperfect and irregular\r\nthough it may be in its progress), in which the fibrinous element\r\nand coagulability of the blood are increased, even in those who are\r\nsuffering from such a condition of the blood and from such diseases as\r\nare naturally accompanied with a decrease in the fibrinous constituent.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. The impoverished condition of the blood, which led to serous\r\neffusions within the ventricles of the brain, and around the brain\r\nand spinal cord, and into the pericardial and abdominal cavities, was\r\ngradually induced by the action of several causes, but chiefly by the\r\ncharacter of the food.\r\n\r\nThe Federal prisoners, as a general rule, had been reared upon wheat\r\nbread and Irish potatos; and the Indian corn so extensively used at\r\nthe South, was almost unknown to them as an article of diet previous\r\nto their capture. Owing to the impossibility of obtaining the\r\nnecessary sieves in the Confederacy for the separation of the husk\r\nfrom the corn-meal, the rations of the Confederate soldiers, as well\r\nas of the Federal prisoners, consisted of unbolted corn-flour, and\r\nmeal and grist; this circumstance rendered the corn-bread still more\r\ndisagreeable and distasteful to the Federal prisoners. While Indian\r\nmeal, even when prepared with the husk, is one of the most wholesome\r\nand nutritious forms of food, as has been already shown by the health\r\nand rapid increase of the Southern population, and especially of the\r\nnegros, previous to the present war, and by the strength, endurance\r\nand activity of the Confederate soldiers, who were throughout the war\r\nconfined to a great extent to unbolted corn-meal; it is nevertheless\r\ntrue that those who have not been reared upon corn-meal, or who have\r\nnot accustomed themselves to its use gradually, become excessively\r\ntired of this kind of diet when suddenly confined to it without a due\r\nproportion of wheat bread. Large numbers of the Federal prisoners\r\nappeared to be utterly disgusted with Indian corn, and immense piles\r\nof corn-bread could be seen in the Stockade and Hospital inclosures.\r\nThose who were so disgusted with this form of food that they had no\r\nappetite to partake of it, except in quantities insufficient to supply\r\nthe waste of the tissues, were, of course, in the condition of men\r\nslowly starving, notwithstanding that the only farinaceous form of food\r\nwhich the Confederate States produced in sufficient abundance for the\r\nmaintenance of armies was not withheld from them. In such cases, an\r\nurgent feeling of hunger was not a prominent symptom; and even when it\r\nexisted at first, it soon disappeared, and was succeeded by an actual\r\nloathing of food. In this state the muscular strength was rapidly\r\ndiminished, the tissues wasted, and the thin, skeleton-like forms moved\r\nabout with the appearance of utter exhaustion and dejection. The mental\r\ncondition connected with long confinement, with the most miserable\r\nsurroundings, and with no hope for the future, also depressed all the\r\nnervous and vital actions, and was especially active in destroying\r\nthe appetite. The effects of mental depression, and of defective\r\nnutrition, were manifested not only in the slow, feeble motions of the\r\nwasted, skeleton-like forms, but also in such lethargy, listlessness,\r\nand torpor of the mental faculties as rendered these unfortunate men\r\noblivious and indifferent to their afflicted condition. In many cases,\r\neven of the greatest apparent suffering and distress, instead of\r\nshowing any anxiety to communicate the causes of their distress, or to\r\nrelate their privations, and their longings for their homes and their\r\nfriends and relatives, they lay in a listless, lethargic, uncomplaining\r\nstate, taking no notice either of their own distressed condition, or\r\nof the gigantic mass of human misery by which they were surrounded.\r\nNothing appalled and depressed me so much as this silent, uncomplaining\r\nmisery. It is a fact of great interest, that notwithstanding this\r\ndefective nutrition in men subjected to crowding and filth, contagious\r\nfevers were rare; and typhus fever, which is supposed to be generated\r\nin just such a state of things as existed at Andersonville, was\r\nunknown. These facts, established by my investigations, stand in\r\nstriking contrast with such a statement as the following by a recent\r\nEnglish writer:\r\n\r\n“A deficiency of food, especially of the nitrogenous part, quickly\r\nleads to the breaking up of the animal frame. Plague, pestilence and\r\nfamine are associated with each other in the public mind, and the\r\nrecords of every country show how closely they are related. The medical\r\nhistory of Ireland is remarkable for the illustrations of how much\r\nmischief may be occasioned by a general deficiency of food. Always the\r\nhabitat of fever, it every now and then becomes the very hot-bed of its\r\npropagation and development. Let there be but a small failure in the\r\nusual imperfect supply of food, and the lurking seeds of pestilence\r\nare ready to burst into frightful activity. The famine of the present\r\ncentury is but too forcible and illustrative of this. It fostered\r\nepidemics which have not been witnessed in this generation, and gave\r\nrise to scenes of devastation and misery which are not surpassed by\r\nthe most appalling epidemics of the Middle Ages. The principal form\r\nof the scourge was known as the contagious famine fever (typhus),\r\nand it spread, not merely from end to end of the country in which it\r\nhad originated, but, breaking through all boundaries, it crossed the\r\nbroad ocean, and made itself painfully manifest in localities where\r\nit was previously unknown. Thousands fell under the virulence of its\r\naction, for wherever it came it struck down a seventh of the people,\r\nand of those whom it attacked, one out of nine perished. Even those who\r\nescaped the fatal influence of it, were left the miserable victims of\r\nscurvy and low fever.”\r\n\r\nWhile we readily admit that famine induces that state of the system\r\nwhich is the most susceptible to the action of fever poisons, and thus\r\ninduces the state of the entire population which is most favorable\r\nfor the rapid and destructive spread of all contagious fevers, at the\r\nsame time we are forced by the facts established by the present war,\r\nas well as by a host of others, both old and new, to admit that we are\r\nstill ignorant of the causes necessary for the origin of typhus fever.\r\nAdded to the imperfect nature of the rations issued to the Federal\r\nprisoners, the difficulties of their situation were at times greatly\r\nincreased by the sudden and desolating Federal raids in Virginia,\r\nGeorgia, and other States, which necessitated the sudden transportation\r\nfrom Richmond and other points threatened of large bodies of prisoners,\r\nwithout the possibility of much previous preparation; and not only did\r\nthese men suffer in transition upon the dilapidated and overburdened\r\nline of railroad communication, but after arriving at Andersonville,\r\nthe rations were frequently insufficient to supply the sudden addition\r\nof several thousand men. And as the Confederacy became more and more\r\npressed, and when powerful hostile armies were plunging through her\r\nbosom, the Federal prisoners of Andersonville suffered incredibly\r\nduring the hasty removal to Millen, Savannah, Charleston, and other\r\npoints, supposed at the time to be secure from the enemy. Each one of\r\nthese causes must be weighed when an attempt is made to estimate the\r\nunusual mortality among these prisoners of war.\r\n\r\nVII. Scurvy, arising from sameness of food and imperfect nutrition,\r\ncaused, either directly or indirectly, nine-tenths of the deaths among\r\nthe Federal prisoners at Andersonville.\r\n\r\nNot only were the deaths referred to unknown causes, to apoplexy, to\r\nanasarca, and to debility, traceable to scurvy and its effects; and not\r\nonly was the mortality in small-pox, pneumonia, and typhoid fever, and\r\nin all acute diseases, more than doubled by the scorbutic taint, but\r\neven those all but universal and deadly bowel affections arose from the\r\nsame causes, and derived their fatal character from the same conditions\r\nwhich produced the scurvy. In truth, these men at Andersonville were\r\nin the condition of a crew at sea, confined in a foul ship upon salt\r\nmeat and unvarying food, and without fresh vegetables. Not only so,\r\nbut these unfortunate prisoners were men forcibly confined and crowded\r\nupon a ship tossed about on a stormy ocean, without a rudder, without\r\na compass, without a guiding-star, and without any apparent boundary\r\nor to their voyage; and they reflected in their steadily increasing\r\nmiseries the distressed condition and waning fortunes of devastated\r\nand bleeding country, which was compelled, in justice to her own\r\nunfortunate sons, to hold these men in the most distressing captivity.\r\n\r\nI saw nothing in the scurvy which prevailed so universally at\r\nAndersonville, at all different from this disease as described by\r\nvarious standard writers. The mortality was no greater than that\r\nwhich has afflicted a hundred ships upon long voyages, and it did not\r\nexceed the mortality which has, upon me than one occasion, and in a\r\nmuch shorter period of time, annihilated large armies and desolated\r\nbeleaguered cities. The general results of my investigations upon\r\nthe chronic diarrhea and dysentery of the Federal prisoners of\r\nAndersonville were similar to those of the English surgeons during the\r\nwar against Russia.\r\n\r\nIX. Drugs exercised but little influence over the progress and fatal\r\ntermination of chronic diarrhea and dysentery in the Military Prison\r\nand Hospital at Andersonville, chiefly because the proper form of\r\nnourishment (milk, rice, vegetables, anti-scorbutics, and nourishing\r\nanimal and vegetable soups) was not issued, and could not be procured\r\nin sufficient quantities for the sick prisoners.\r\n\r\nOpium allayed pain and checked the bowels temporarily, but the frail\r\ndam was soon swept away, and the patient appears to be but little\r\nbetter, if not the worse, for this merely palliative treatment. The\r\nroot of the difficulty could not be reached by drugs; nothing short of\r\nthe wanting elements of nutrition would have tended in any manner to\r\nrestore the tone of the digestive system, and of all the wasted and\r\ndegenerated organs and tissues. My opinion to this effect was expressed\r\nmost decidedly to the medical officers in charge of these unfortunate\r\nmen. The correctness of this view was sustained by the healthy and\r\nrobust condition of the paroled prisoners, who received an extra\r\nration, and who were able to make considerable sums by trading, and who\r\nsupplied themselves with a liberal and varied diet.\r\n\r\nX. The fact that hospital gangrene appeared in the Stockade first,\r\nand originated spontaneously, without any previous contagion, and\r\noccurred sporadically all over the Stockade and Prison Hospital, was\r\nproof positive that this disease will arise whenever the conditions of\r\ncrowding, filth, foul air, and bad diet are present.\r\n\r\nThe exhalations from the Hospital and Stockade appeared to exert their\r\neffects to a considerable distance outside of these localities. The\r\norigin of gangrene among these prisoners appeared clearly to depend in\r\ngreat measure upon the state of the general system, induced by diet,\r\nexposure, neglect of personal cleanliness; and by various external\r\nnoxious influences. The rapidity of the appearance and action of the\r\ngangrene depended upon the powers and state of the constitution, as\r\nwell as upon the intensity of the poison in the atmosphere, or upon the\r\ndirect application of poisonous matter to the wounded surface. This was\r\nfurther illustrated by the important fact, that hospital gangrene, or a\r\ndisease resembling this form of gangrene, attacked the intestinal canal\r\nof patients laboring under ulceration of the bowels, although there\r\nwere no local manifestations of gangrene upon the surface of the body.\r\nThis mode of termination in cases of dysentery was quite common in the\r\nfoul atmosphere of the Confederate States Military Prison Hospital; and\r\nin the depressed, depraved condition of the system of these Federal\r\nprisoners, death ensued very rapidly after the gangrenous state of the\r\nintestines was established.\r\n\r\nXI. A scorbutic condition of the system appeared to favor the origin of\r\nfoul ulcers, which frequently took on true hospital gangrene.\r\n\r\nScurvy and gangrene frequently existed in the same individual. In such\r\ncases, vegetable diet with vegetable acids would remove the scorbutic\r\ncondition without curing the hospital gangrene.. . Scurvy consists\r\nnot only in an alteration in the constitution of the blood, which\r\nleads to passive hemorrhages from the bowels, and the effusion into\r\nthe various tissues of a deeply-colored fibrinous exudation; but, as\r\nwe have conclusively shown by postmortem examination, this state is\r\nattended with consistence of the muscles of the heart, and the mucous\r\nmembrane of the alimentary canal, and of solid parts generally. We\r\nhave, according to the extent of the deficiency of certain articles\r\nof food, every degree of scorbutic derangement, from the most fearful\r\ndepravation of the blood and the perversion of every function\r\nsubserved by the blood to those slight derangements which are scarcely\r\ndistinguishable from a state of health. We are as yet ignorant of\r\nthe true nature of the changes of the blood and tissues in scurvy,\r\nand wide field for investigation is open for the determination the\r\ncharacteristic changes--physical, chemical, and physiological--of the\r\nblood and tissues, and of the secretions and excretions of scurvy. Such\r\ninquiries would be of great value in their bearing upon the origin\r\nof hospital gangrene. Up to the present war, the results of chemical\r\ninvestigations upon the pathology of the blood in scurvy were not\r\nonly contradictory, but meager, and wanting in that careful detail\r\nof the cases from which the blood was abstracted which would enable\r\nus to explain the cause of the apparent discrepancies in different\r\nanalyses. Thus it is not yet settled whether the fibrin is increased\r\nor diminished in this disease; and the differences which exist in the\r\nstatements of different writers appear to be referable to the neglect\r\nof a critical examination and record of all the symptoms of the cases\r\nfrom which the blood was abstracted. The true nature of the changes of\r\nthe blood in scurvy can be established only by numerous analyses during\r\ndifferent stages of the disease, and followed up by carefully performed\r\nand recorded postmortem examinations. With such data we could settle\r\nsuch important questions as whether the increase of fibrin in scurvy\r\nwas invariably dependent upon some local inflammation.\r\n\r\nXII. Gangrenous spots, followed by rapid destruction of tissue,\r\nappeared in some cases in which there had been no previous or existing\r\nwound or abrasion; and without such well established facts, it might\r\nbe assumed that the disease was propagated from one patient to another\r\nin every case, either by exhalations from the gangrenous surface or by\r\ndirect contact.\r\n\r\nIn such a filthy and crowded hospital as that of the Confederate,\r\nStates Military Prison of Camp Sumter, Andersonville, it was impossible\r\nto isolate the wounded from the sources of actual contact of the\r\ngangrenous matter. The flies swarming over the wounds and over filth of\r\nevery description; the filthy, imperfectly washed, and scanty rags; the\r\nlimited number of sponges and wash-bowls (the same wash-bowl and sponge\r\nserving for a score or more of patients), were one and all sources of\r\nsuch constant circulation of the gangrenous matter, that the disease\r\nmight rapidly be propagated from a single gangrenous wound. While the\r\nfact already considered, that a form of moist gangrene, resembling\r\nhospital gangrene, was quite common in this foul atmosphere in cases\r\nof dysentery, both with and without the existence of hospital gangrene\r\nupon the surface, demonstrates the dependence of the disease upon the\r\nstate of the constitution, and proves in a clear manner that neither\r\nthe contact of the poisonous matter of gangrene, nor the direct action\r\nof the poisoned atmosphere upon the ulcerated surface, is necessary\r\nto the development of the disease; on the other hand, it is equally\r\nwell-established that the disease may be communicated by the various\r\nways just mentioned. It is impossible to determine the length of time\r\nwhich rags and clothing saturated with gangrenous matter will retain\r\nthe power of reproducing the disease when applied to healthy wounds.\r\nProfessor Brugmans, as quoted by Guthrie in his commentaries on the\r\nsurgery of the war in Portugal, Spain, France, and the Netherlands,\r\nsays that in 1797, in Holland, ‘charpie,’ composed of linen threads cut\r\nof different lengths, which, on inquiry, it was found had been already\r\nused in the great hospitals in France, and had been subsequently washed\r\nand bleached, caused every ulcer to which it was applied to be affected\r\nby hospital gangrene. Guthrie affirms in the same work, that the fact\r\nthat this disease was readily communicated by the application of\r\ninstruments, lint, or bandages which had been in contact with infected\r\nparts, was too firmly established by the experience of every one in\r\nPortugal and Spain to be a matter of doubt. There are facts to show\r\nthat flies may be the means of communicating malignant pustules. Dr.\r\nWagner, who has related several cases of malignant pustule produced in\r\nman and beasts, both by contact and by eating the flesh of diseased\r\nanimals, which happened in the village of Striessa in Saxony, in 1834,\r\ngives two very remarkable cases which occurred eight days after any\r\nbeast had been affected with the disease. Both were women, one of\r\ntwenty-six and the other of fifty years, and in them the pustules were\r\nwell marked, and the general symptoms similar to the other cases. The\r\nlatter patient said she had been bitten by a fly upon the back d the\r\nneck, at which part the carbuncle appeared; and the former, that she\r\nhad also been bitten upon the right upper arm by a gnat. Upon inquiry,\r\nWagner found that the skin of one of the infected beasts had been hung\r\non a neighboring wall, and thought it very possible that the insects\r\nmight have been attracted to them by the smell, and had thence conveyed\r\nthe poison.\r\n\r\n[End of Dr. Stevenson’s Statement]\r\n\r\n                    ..........................\r\n\r\nThe old adage says that “Hunger is the best sauce for poor food,” but\r\nhunger failed to render this detestable stuff palatable, and it became\r\nso loathsome that very many actually starved to death because unable to\r\nforce their organs of deglutition to receive the nauseous dose and pass\r\nit to the stomach. I was always much healthier than the average of the\r\nboys, and my appetite consequently much better, yet for the last month\r\nthat I was in Andersonville, it required all my determination to crowd\r\nthe bread down my throat, and, as I have stated before, I could only do\r\nthis by breaking off small bits at a time, and forcing each down as I\r\nwould a pill.\r\n\r\nA large part of this repulsiveness was due to the coarseness and\r\nfoulness of the meal, the wretched cooking, and the lack of salt,\r\nbut there was a still more potent reason than all these. Nature does\r\nnot intend that man shall live by bread alone, nor by any one kind\r\nof food. She indicates this by the varying tastes and longings that\r\nshe gives him. If his body needs one kind of constituents, his tastes\r\nlead him to desire the food that is richest in those constituents.\r\nWhen he has taken as much as his system requires, the sense of satiety\r\nsupervenes, and he “becomes tired” of that particular food. If tastes\r\nare not perverted, but allowed a free but temperate exercise, they are\r\nthe surest indicators of the way to preserve health and strength by a\r\njudicious selection of alimentation.\r\n\r\nIn this case Nature was protesting by a rebellion of the tastes against\r\nany further use of that species of food. She was saying, as plainly as\r\nshe ever spoke, that death could only be averted by a change of diet,\r\nwhich would supply our bodies with the constituents they so sadly\r\nneeded, and which could not be supplied by corn meal.\r\n\r\nHow needless was this confinement of our rations to corn meal, and\r\nespecially to such wretchedly prepared meal, is conclusively shown by\r\nthe Rebel testimony heretofore given. It would have been very little\r\nextra trouble to the Rebels to have had our meal sifted; we would\r\ngladly have done it ourselves if allowed the utensils and opportunity.\r\nIt would have been as little trouble to have varied our rations with\r\ngreen corn and sweet potatos, of which the country was then full.\r\n\r\nA few wagon loads of roasting ears and sweet potatos would have\r\nbanished every trace of scurvy from the camp, healed up the wasting\r\ndysentery, and saved thousands of lives. Any day that the Rebels had\r\nchosen they could have gotten a thousand volunteers who would have\r\ngiven their solemn parole not to escape, and gone any distance into the\r\ncountry, to gather the potatos and corn, and such other vegetables as\r\nwere readily obtainable, and bring, them into the camp.\r\n\r\nWhatever else may be said in defense of the Southern management of\r\nmilitary prisons, the permitting seven thousand men to die of the\r\nscurvy in the Summer time, in the midst of an agricultural region,\r\nfilled with all manner of green vegetation, must forever remain\r\nimpossible of explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\nSOLICITUDE AS TO THE FATE OF ATLANTA AND SHERMAN’S ARMY--PAUCITY OF\r\nNEWS --HOW WE HEARD THAT ATLANTA HAD FALLEN--ANNOUNCEMENT OF A GENERAL\r\nEXCHANGE--WE LEAVE ANDERSONVILLE.\r\n\r\nWe again began to be exceedingly solicitous over the fate of Atlanta\r\nand Sherman’s Army: we had heard but little directly from that front\r\nfor several weeks. Few prisoners had come in since those captured in\r\nthe bloody engagements of the 20th, 22d, and 28th of July. In spite\r\nof their confident tones, and our own sanguine hopes, the outlook\r\nadmitted of very grave doubts. The battles of the last week of July\r\nhad been looked at it in the best light possible--indecisive. Our men\r\nhad held their own, it is true, but an invading army can not afford\r\nto simply hold its own. Anything short of an absolute success is to\r\nit disguised defeat. Then we knew that the cavalry column sent out\r\nunder Stoneman had been so badly handled by that inefficient commander\r\nthat it had failed ridiculously in its object, being beaten in detail,\r\nand suffering the loss of its commander and a considerable portion\r\nof its numbers. This had been followed by a defeat of our infantry\r\nat Etowah Creek, and then came a long interval in which we received\r\nno news save what the Rebel papers contained, and they pretended no\r\ndoubt that Sherman’s failure was already demonstrated. Next came\r\nwell-authenticated news that Sherman had raised the siege and fallen\r\nback to the Chattahoochee, and we felt something of the bitterness of\r\ndespair. For days thereafter we heard nothing, though the hot, close\r\nSummer air seemed surcharged with the premonitions of a war storm about\r\nto burst, even as nature heralds in the same way a concentration of the\r\nmighty force of the elements for the grand crash of the thunderstorm.\r\nWe waited in tense expectancy for the decision of the fates whether\r\nfinal victory or defeat should end the long and arduous campaign.\r\n\r\nAt night the guards in the perches around the Stockade called out\r\nevery half hour, so as to show the officers that they were awake and\r\nattending to their duty. The formula for this ran thus:\r\n\r\n“Post numbah 1; half-past eight o’clock, and a-l-l’s w-e-l-l!”\r\n\r\nPost No. 2 repeated this cry, and so it went around.\r\n\r\nOne evening when our anxiety as to Atlanta was wrought to the highest\r\npitch, one of the guards sang out:\r\n\r\n“Post numbah foah--half past eight o’clock--and Atlanta’s--gone--t-o\r\n--hell.”\r\n\r\nThe heart of every man within hearing leaped to his mouth. We looked\r\ntoward each other, almost speechless with glad surprise, and then\r\ngasped out:\r\n\r\n“Did you hear THAT?”\r\n\r\nThe next instant such a ringing cheer burst out as wells spontaneously\r\nfrom the throats and hearts of men, in the first ecstatic moments of\r\nvictory--a cheer to which our saddened hearts and enfeebled lungs\r\nhad long been strangers. It was the genuine, honest, manly Northern\r\ncheer, as different from the shrill Rebel yell as the honest mastiff’s\r\ndeep-voiced welcome is from the howl of the prowling wolf.\r\n\r\nThe shout was taken up all over the prison. Even those who had not\r\nheard the guard understood that it meant that “Atlanta was ours and\r\nfairly won,” and they took up the acclamation with as much enthusiasm\r\nas we had begun it. All thoughts of sleep were put to flight: we would\r\nhave a season of rejoicing. Little knots gathered together, debated the\r\nnews, and indulged in the most sanguine hopes as to the effect upon\r\nthe Rebels. In some parts of the Stockade stump speeches were made. I\r\nbelieve that Boston Corbett and his party organized a prayer and praise\r\nmeeting. In our corner we stirred up our tuneful friend “Nosey,” who\r\nsang again the grand old patriotic hymns that set our thin blood to\r\nbounding, and made us remember that we were still Union soldiers, with\r\nhigher hopes than that of starving and dying in Andersonville. He sang\r\nthe ever-glorious Star Spangled Banner, as he used to sing it around\r\nthe camp fire in happier days, when we were in the field. He sang the\r\nrousing “Rally Round the Flag,” with its wealth of patriotic fire and\r\nmartial vigor, and we, with throats hoarse from shouting; joined in the\r\nchorus until the welkin rang again.\r\n\r\nThe Rebels became excited, lest our exaltation of spirits would lead\r\nto an assault upon the Stockade. They got under arms, and remained so\r\nuntil the enthusiasm became less demonstrative.\r\n\r\nA few days later--on the evening of the 6th of September--the Rebel\r\nSergeants who called the roll entered the Stockade, and each assembling\r\nhis squads, addressed them as follows:\r\n\r\n“PRISONERS: I am instructed by General Winder to inform you that a\r\ngeneral exchange has been agreed upon. Twenty thousand men will be\r\nexchanged immediately at Savannah, where your vessels are now waiting\r\nfor you. Detachments from One to Ten will prepare to leave early\r\nto-morrow morning.”\r\n\r\nThe excitement that this news produced was simply indescribable. I\r\nhave seen men in every possible exigency that can confront men, and a\r\nlarge proportion viewed that which impended over them with at least\r\noutward composure. The boys around me had endured all that we suffered\r\nwith stoical firmness. Groans from pain-racked bodies could not be\r\nrepressed, and bitter curses and maledictions against the Rebels leaped\r\nunbidden to the lips at the slightest occasion, but there was no\r\nmurmuring or whining. There was not a day--hardly an hour--in which one\r\ndid not see such exhibitions of manly fortitude as made him proud of\r\nbelonging to a race of which every individual was a hero.\r\n\r\nBut the emotion which pain and suffering and danger could not develop,\r\njoy could, and boys sang, and shouted and cried, and danced as if in\r\na delirium. “God’s country,” fairer than the sweet promised land of\r\nCanaan appeared to the rapt vision of the Hebrew poet prophet, spread\r\nout in glad vista before the mind’s eye of every one. It had come--at\r\nlast it had come that which we had so longed for, wished for, prayed\r\nfor, dreamed of; schemed, planned, toiled for, and for which went up\r\nthe last earnest, dying wish of the thousands of our comrades who would\r\nnow know no exchange save into that eternal “God’s country” where\r\n\r\n               Sickness and sorrow, pain and death\r\n               Are felt and feared no more.\r\n\r\nOur “preparations,” for leaving were few and simple. When the morning\r\ncame, and shortly after the order to move, Andrews and I picked our\r\nwell-worn blanket, our tattered overcoat, our rude chessmen, and no\r\nless rude board, our little black can, and the spoon made of hoop-iron,\r\nand bade farewell to the hole-in-the-ground that had been our home for\r\nnearly seven long months.\r\n\r\nMy feet were still in miserable condition from the lacerations received\r\nin the attempt to escape, but I took one of our tent poles as a staff\r\nand hobbled away. We re-passed the gates which we had entered on that\r\nFebruary night, ages since, it seemed, and crawled slowly over to the\r\ndepot.\r\n\r\nI had come to regard the Rebels around us as such measureless liars\r\nthat my first impulse was to believe the reverse of anything they said\r\nto us; and even now, while I hoped for the best, my old habit of mind\r\nwas so strongly upon me that I had some doubts of our going to be\r\nexchanged, simply because it was a Rebel who had said so. But in the\r\ncrowd of Rebels who stood close to the road upon which we were walking\r\nwas a young Second Lieutenant, who said to a Colonel as I passed:\r\n\r\n“Weil, those fellows can sing ‘Homeward Bound,’ can’t they?”\r\n\r\nThis set my last misgiving at rest. Now I was certain that we were\r\ngoing to be exchanged, and my spirits soared to the skies.\r\n\r\nEntering the cars we thumped and pounded toilsomely along, after\r\nthe manner of Southern railroads, at the rate of six or eight miles\r\nan hour. Savannah was two hundred and forty miles away, and to our\r\nimpatient minds it seemed as if we would never get there. The route\r\nlay the whole distance through the cheerless pine barrens which cover\r\nthe greater part of Georgia. The only considerable town on the way was\r\nMacon, which had then a population of five thousand or thereabouts. For\r\nscores of miles there would not be a sign of a human habitation, and in\r\nthe one hundred and eighty miles between Macon and Savannah there were\r\nonly three insignificant villages. There was a station every ten miles,\r\nat which the only building was an open shed, to shelter from sun and\r\nrain a casual passenger, or a bit of goods.\r\n\r\nThe occasional specimens of the poor white “cracker” population that\r\nwe saw, seemed indigenous products of the starved soil. They suited\r\ntheir poverty-stricken surroundings as well as the gnarled and scrubby\r\nvegetation suited the sterile sand. Thin-chested, round-shouldered,\r\nscraggy-bearded, dull-eyed and open-mouthed, they all looked alike--all\r\nlooked as ignorant, as stupid, and as lazy as they were poor and\r\nweak. They were “low-downers” in every respect, and made our rough\r\nand simple. minded East Tennesseans look like models of elegant and\r\ncultured gentlemen in contrast.\r\n\r\nWe looked on the poverty-stricken land with good-natured contempt, for\r\nwe thought we were leaving it forever, and would soon be in one which,\r\ncompared to it, was as the fatness at Egypt to the leanness of the\r\ndesert of Sinai.\r\n\r\nThe second day after leaving Andersonville our train struggled across\r\nthe swamps into Savannah, and rolled slowly down the live oak shaded\r\nstreets into the center of the City. It seemed like another Deserted\r\nVillage, so vacant and noiseless the streets, and the buildings\r\neverywhere so overgrown with luxuriant vegetation: The limbs of the\r\nshade trees crashed along and broke, upon the tops of our cars, as if\r\nno train had passed that way for years. Through the interstices between\r\nthe trees and clumps of foliage could be seen the gleaming white marble\r\nof the monuments erected to Greene and Pulaski, looking like giant\r\ntombstones in a City of the Dead. The unbroken stillness--so different\r\nfrom what we expected on entering the metropolis of Georgia, and a City\r\nthat was an important port in Revolutionary days--became absolutely\r\noppressive. We could not understand it, but our thoughts were more\r\nintent upon the coming transfer to our flag than upon any speculation\r\nas to the cause of the remarkable somnolence of Savannah.\r\n\r\nFinally some little boys straggled out to where our car was standing,\r\nand we opened up a conversation with them:\r\n\r\n“Say, boys, are our vessels down in the harbor yet?”\r\n\r\nThe reply came in that piercing treble shriek in which a boy of ten or\r\ntwelve makes even his most confidential communications:\r\n\r\n“I don’t know.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” (with our confidence in exchange somewhat dashed,) “they intend\r\nto exchange us here, don’t they?”\r\n\r\nAnother falsetto scream, “I don’t know.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” (with something of a quaver in the questioner’s voice,) “what\r\nare they going to do, with us, any way?”\r\n\r\n“O,” (the treble shriek became almost demoniac) “they are fixing up a\r\nplace over by the old jail for you.”\r\n\r\nWhat a sinking of hearts was there then! Andrews and I would not give\r\nup hope so speedily as some others did, and resolved to believe, for\r\nawhile at least, that we were going to be exchanged.\r\n\r\nOrdered out of the cars, we were marched along the street. A crowd\r\nof small boys, full of the curiosity of the animal, gathered around\r\nus as we marched. Suddenly a door in a rather nice house opened; an\r\nangry-faced woman appeared on the steps and shouted out:\r\n\r\n“Boys! BOYS! What are you doin’ there! Come up on the steps immejitely!\r\nCome away from them n-a-s-t-y things!”\r\n\r\nI will admit that we were not prepossessing in appearance; nor were\r\nwe as cleanly as young gentlemen should habitually be; in fact, I may\r\nas well confess that I would not now, if I could help it, allow a\r\ntramp, as dilapidated in raiment, as unwashed, unshorn, uncombed, and\r\npopulous with insects as we were, to come within several rods of me.\r\nNevertheless, it was not pleasant to hear so accurate a description\r\nof our personal appearance sent forth on the wings of the wind by a\r\nshrill-voiced Rebel female.\r\n\r\nA short march brought us to the place “they were fixing for us by the\r\nold jail.” It was another pen, with high walls of thick pine plank,\r\nwhich told us only too plainly how vain were our expectations of\r\nexchange.\r\n\r\nWhen we were turned inside, and I realized that the gates of another\r\nprison had closed upon me, hope forsook me. I flung our odious little\r\npossessions-our can, chess-board, overcoat, and blanket-upon the\r\nground, and, sitting down beside them, gave way to the bitterest\r\ndespair. I wanted to die, O, so badly. Never in all my life had I\r\ndesired anything in the world so much as I did now to get out of it.\r\nHad I had pistol, knife, rope, or poison, I would have ended my prison\r\nlife then and there, and departed with the unceremoniousness of a\r\nFrench leave. I remembered that I could get a quietus from a guard with\r\nvery little trouble, but I would not give one of the bitterly hated\r\nRebels the triumph of shooting me. I longed to be another Samson, with\r\nthe whole Southern Confederacy gathered in another Temple of Dagon,\r\nthat I might pull down the supporting pillars, and die happy in slaying\r\nthousands of my enemies.\r\n\r\nWhile I was thus sinking deeper and deeper in the Slough of Despond,\r\nthe firing of a musket, and the shriek of the man who was struck,\r\nattracted my attention. Looking towards the opposite end of the pen\r\nI saw a guard bringing his still smoking musket to a “recover arms,”\r\nand, not fifteen feet from him, a prisoner lying on the ground in the\r\nagonies of death. The latter had a pipe in his mouth when he was shot,\r\nand his teeth still clenched its stem. His legs and arms were drawn up\r\nconvulsively, and he was rocking backward and forward on his back. The\r\ncharge had struck him just above the hip-bone.\r\n\r\nThe Rebel officer in command of the guard was sitting on his horse\r\ninside the pen at the time, and rode forward to see what the matter\r\nwas. Lieutenant Davis, who had come with us from Andersonville, was\r\nalso sitting on a horse inside the prison, and he called out in his\r\nusual harsh, disagreeable voice:\r\n\r\n“That’s all right, Cunnel; the man’s done just as I awdahed him to.”\r\n\r\nI found that lying around inside were a number of bits of plank--each\r\nabout five feet long, which had been sawed off by the carpenters\r\nengaged in building the prison. The ground being a bare common, was\r\ndestitute of all shelter, and the pieces looked as if they would be\r\nquite useful in building a tent. There may have been an order issued\r\nforbidding the prisoners to touch them, but if so, I had not heard it,\r\nand I imagine the first intimation to the prisoner just killed that the\r\nboards were not to be taken was the bullet which penetrated his vitals.\r\nTwenty-five cents would be a liberal appraisement of the value of the\r\nlumber for which the boy lost his life.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour afterward we thought we saw all the guards march out of\r\nthe front gate. There was still another pile of these same kind of\r\npieces of board lying at the further side of the prison. The crowd\r\naround me noticed it, and we all made a rush for it. In spite of my\r\nlame feet I outstripped the rest, and was just in the act of stooping\r\ndown to pick the boards up when a loud yell from those behind startled\r\nme. Glancing to my left I saw a guard cocking his gun and bringing\r\nit up to shoot me. With one frightened spring, as quick as a flash,\r\nand before he could cover me, I landed fully a rod back in the crowd,\r\nand mixed with it. The fellow tried hard to draw a bead on me, but I\r\nwas too quick for him, and he finally lowered his gun with an oath\r\nexpressive of disappointment in not being able to kill a Yankee.\r\n\r\nWalking back to my place the full ludicrousness of the thing dawned\r\nupon me so forcibly that I forgot all about my excitement and scare,\r\nand laughed aloud. Here, not an hour age I was murmuring because I\r\ncould find no way to die; I sighed for death as a bridegroom for the\r\ncoming of his bride, an yet, when a Rebel had pointed his gun at me, it\r\nhad nearly scared me out of a year’s growth, and made me jump farther\r\nthan I could possibly do when my feet were well, and I was in good\r\ncondition otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\nSAVANNAH--DEVICES TO OBTAIN MATERIALS FOR A TENT--THEIR ULTIMATE\r\nSUCCESS --RESUMPTION OF TUNNELING--ESCAPING BY WHOLESALE AND BEING\r\nRECAPTURED EN MASSE--THE OBSTACLES THAT LAY BETWEEN US AND OUR LINES.\r\n\r\nAndrews and I did not let the fate of the boy who was killed, nor my\r\nown narrow escape from losing the top of my head, deter us from farther\r\nefforts to secure possession of those coveted boards. My readers\r\nremember the story of the boy who, digging vigorously at a hole,\r\nreplied to the remark of a passing traveler that there was probably no\r\nground-hog there, and, even if there was, “ground-hog was mighty poor\r\neatin’, any way,” with:\r\n\r\n“Mister, there’s got to be a ground-hog there; our family’s out o’\r\nmeat!”\r\n\r\nThat was what actuated us: we were out of material for a tent. Our\r\nsolitary blanket had rotted and worn full of holes by its long double\r\nduty, as bed-clothes and tent at Andersonville, and there was an\r\nimperative call for a substitute.\r\n\r\nAndrews and I flattered ourselves that when we matched our collective\r\nor individual wits against those of a Johnny his defeat was pretty\r\ncertain, and with this cheerful estimate of our own powers to animate\r\nus, we set to work to steal the boards from under the guard’s nose. The\r\nJohnny had malice in his heart and buck-and-ball in his musket, but his\r\neyes were not sufficiently numerous to adequately discharge all the\r\nduties laid upon him. He had too many different things to watch at the\r\nsame time. I would approach a gap in the fence not yet closed as if\r\nI intended making a dash through it for liberty, and when the Johnny\r\nhad concentrated all his attention on letting me have the contents of\r\nhis gun just as soon as he could have a reasonable excuse for doing\r\nso, Andrews would pick u a couple of boards and slip away with them.\r\nThen I would fall back in pretended (and some real) alarm, and--Andrew\r\nwould come up and draw his attention by a similar feint, while I made\r\noff with a couple more pieces. After a few hours c this strategy, we\r\nfound ourselves the possessors of some dozen planks, with which we made\r\na lean-to, that formed a tolerable shelter for our heads and the upper\r\nportion of our bodies. As the boards were not over five feet long,\r\nand the slope reduce the sheltered space to about four-and-one-half\r\nfeet, it left the lower part of our naked feet and legs to project\r\nout-of-doors. Andrews used to lament very touchingly the sunburning his\r\ntoe-nails were receiving. He knew that his complexion was being ruined\r\nfor life, and all the Balm of a Thousand Flowers in the world would\r\nnot restore his comely ankles to that condition of pristine loveliness\r\nwhich would admit of their introduction into good society again.\r\nAnother defect was that, like the fun in a practical joke, it was all\r\non one side; there was not enough of it to go clear round. It was very\r\nunpleasant, when a storm came up in a direction different from that we\r\nhad calculated upon, to be compelled to get out in the midst of it, and\r\nbuild our house over to face the other way.\r\n\r\nStill we had a tent, and were that much better off than three-fourths\r\nof our comrades who had no shelter at all. We were owners of a brown\r\nstone front on Fifth Avenue compared to the other fellows.\r\n\r\nOur tent erected, we began a general survey of our new abiding place.\r\nThe ground was a sandy common in the outskirts of Savannah. The sand\r\nwas covered with a light sod. The Rebels, who knew nothing of our\r\nburrowing propensities, had neglected to make the plank forming the\r\nwalls of the Prison project any distance below the surface of the\r\nground, and had put up no Dead Line around the inside; so that it\r\nlooked as if everything was arranged expressly to invite us to tunnel\r\nout. We were not the boys to neglect such an invitation. By night about\r\nthree thousand had been received from Andersonville, and placed inside.\r\nWhen morning came it looked as if a colony of gigantic rats had been at\r\nwork. There was a tunnel every ten or fifteen feet, and at least twelve\r\nhundred of us had gone out through them during the night. I never\r\nunderstood why all in the pen did not follow our example, and leave the\r\nguards watching a forsaken Prison. There was nothing to prevent it. An\r\nhour’s industrious work with a half-canteen would take any one outside,\r\nor if a boy was too lazy to dig his own tunnel, he could have the use\r\nof one of the hundred others that had been dug.\r\n\r\nBut escaping was only begun when the Stockade was passed. The site of\r\nSavannah is virtually an island. On the north is the Savannah River;\r\nto the east, southeast and south, are the two Ogeechee rivers, and a\r\nchain of sounds and lagoons connecting with the Atlantic Ocean. To\r\nthe west is a canal connecting the Savannah and Big Ogeechee Rivers.\r\nWe found ourselves headed off by water whichever way we went. All the\r\nbridges were guarded, and all the boats destroyed. Early in the morning\r\nthe Rebels discovered our absence, and the whole garrison of Savannah\r\nwas sent out on patrol after us. They picked up the boys in squads of\r\nfrom ten to thirty, lurking around the shores of the streams waiting\r\nfor night to come, to get across, or engaged in building rafts for\r\ntransportation. By evening the whole mob of us were back in the pen\r\nagain. As nobody was punished for running away, we treated the whole\r\naffair as a lark, and those brought back first stood around the gate\r\nand yelled derisively as the others came in.\r\n\r\nThat night big fires were built all around the Stockade, and a line\r\nof guards placed on the ground inside of these. In spite of this\r\nprecaution, quite a number escaped. The next day a Dead Line was put\r\nup inside of the Prison, twenty feet from the Stockade. This only\r\nincreased the labor of burrowing, by making us go farther. Instead of\r\nbeing able to tunnel out in an hour, it now took three or four hours.\r\nThat night several hundred of us, rested from our previous performance,\r\nand hopeful of better luck, brought our faithful half canteens--now\r\nscoured very bright by constant use-into requisition again, and before\r\nthe morning. dawned we had gained the high reeds of the swamps, where\r\nwe lay concealed until night.\r\n\r\nIn this way we managed to evade the recapture that came to most of\r\nthose who went out, but it was a fearful experience. Having been raised\r\nin a country where venomous snakes abounded, I had that fear and horror\r\nof them that inhabitants of those districts feel, and of which people\r\nliving in sections free from such a scourge know little. I fancied\r\nthat the Southern swamps were filled with all forms of loathsome and\r\npoisonous reptiles, and it required all my courage to venture into\r\nthem barefooted. Besides, the snags and roots hurt our feet fearfully.\r\nOur hope was to find a boat somewhere, in which we could float out to\r\nsea, and trust to being picked up by some of the blockading fleet. But\r\nno boat could we find, with all our painful and diligent search. We\r\nlearned afterward that the Rebels made a practice of breaking up all\r\nthe boats along the shore to prevent negros and their own deserters\r\nfrom escaping to the blockading fleet. We thought of making a raft\r\nof logs, but had we had the strength to do this, we would doubtless\r\nhave thought it too risky, since we dreaded missing the vessels, and\r\nbeing carried out to sea to perish of hunger. During the night we came\r\nto the railroad bridge across the Ogeechee. We had some slender hope\r\nthat, if we could reach this we might perhaps get across the river,\r\nand find better opportunities for escape. But these last expectations\r\nwere blasted by the discovery that it was guarded. There was a post\r\nand a fire on the shore next us, and a single guard with a lantern was\r\nstationed on one of the middle spans. Almost famished with hunger, and\r\nso weary and footsore that we could scarcely move another step, we went\r\nback to a cleared place on the high ground, and laid down to sleep,\r\nentirely reckless as to what became of us. Late in the morning we were\r\nawakened by the Rebel patrol and taken back to the prison. Lieutenant\r\nDavis, disgusted with the perpetual attempts to escape, moved the\r\nDead Line out forty feet from the Stockade; but this restricted our\r\nroom greatly, since the number of prisoners in the pen had now risen\r\nto about six thousand, and, besides, it offered little additional\r\nprotection against tunneling.\r\n\r\nIt was not much more difficult to dig fifty feet than it had been to\r\ndig thirty feet. Davis soon realized this, and put the Dead Line back\r\nto twenty feet. His next device was a much more sensible one. A crowd\r\nof one hundred and fifty negros dug a trench twenty feet wide and five\r\nfeet deep around the whole prison on the outside, and this ditch was\r\nfilled with water from the City Water Works. No one could cross this\r\nwithout attracting the attention of the guards.\r\n\r\nStill we were not discouraged, and Andrews and I joined a crowd that\r\nwas constructing a large tunnel from near our quarters on the east side\r\nof the pen. We finished the burrow to within a few inches of the edge\r\nof the ditch, and then ceased operations, to await some stormy night,\r\nwhen we could hope to get across the ditch unnoticed.\r\n\r\nOrders were issued to guards to fire without warning on men who were\r\nobserved to be digging or carrying out dirt after nightfall. They\r\noccasionally did so, but the risk did not keep anyone from tunneling.\r\nOur tunnel ran directly under a sentry box. When carrying dirt away\r\nthe bearer of the bucket had to turn his back on the guard and walk\r\ndirectly down the street in front of him, two hundred or three hundred\r\nfeet, to the center of the camp, where he scattered the sand around--so\r\nas to give no indication of where it came from. Though we always\r\nwaited till the moon went down, it seemed as if, unless the guard were\r\na fool, both by nature and training, he could not help taking notice\r\nof what was going on under his eyes. I do not recall any more nervous\r\npromenades in my life, than those when, taking my turn, I received my\r\nbucket of sand at the mouth of the tunnel, and walked slowly away with\r\nit. The most disagreeable part was in turning my back to the guard.\r\nCould I have faced him, I had sufficient confidence in my quickness of\r\nperception, and talents as a dodger, to imagine that I could make it\r\ndifficult for him to hit me. But in walling with my back to him I was\r\nwholly at his mercy. Fortune, however, favored us, and we were allowed\r\nto go on with our work--night after night--without a shot.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile another happy thought slowly gestated in Davis’s\r\nalleged intellect. How he came to give birth to two ideas with no more\r\nthan a week between them, puzzled all who knew him, and still more\r\nthat he survived this extraordinary strain upon the gray matter of the\r\ncerebrum. His new idea was to have driven a heavily-laden mule cart\r\naround the inside of the Dead Line at least once a day. The wheels or\r\nthe mule’s feet broke through the thin sod covering the tunnels and\r\nexposed them. Our tunnel went with the rest, and those of our crowd\r\nwho wore shoes had humiliation added to sorrow by being compelled to\r\ngo in and spade the hole full of dirt. This put an end to subterranean\r\nengineering.\r\n\r\nOne day one of the boys watched his opportunity, got under the ration\r\nwagon, and clinging close to the coupling pole with hands and feet, was\r\ncarried outside. He was detected, however, as he came from under the\r\nwagon, and brought back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\nFRANK REVERSTOCK’S ATTEMPT AT ESCAPE--PASSING OFF AS REBEL BOY HE\r\nREACHES GRISWOLDVILLE BY RAIL, AND THEN STRIKES ACROSS THE COUNTRY FOR\r\nSHERMAN, BUT IS CAUGHT WITHIN TWENTY MILES OF OUR LINES.\r\n\r\nOne of the shrewdest and nearest successful attempts to escape that\r\ncame under my notice was that of my friend Sergeant Frank Reverstock,\r\nof the Third West Virginia Cavalry, of whom I have before spoken.\r\nFrank, who was quite small, with a smooth boyish face, had converted\r\nto his own use a citizen’s coat, belonging to a young boy, a Sutler’s\r\nassistant, who had died in Andersonville. He had made himself a pair\r\nof bag pantaloons and a shirt from pieces of meal sacks which he had\r\nappropriated from day to day. He had also the Sutler’s assistant’s\r\nshoes, and, to crown all, he wore on his head one of those hideous\r\nlooking hats of quilted calico which the Rebels had taken to wearing\r\nin the lack of felt hats, which they could neither make nor buy.\r\nAltogether Frank looked enough like a Rebel to be dangerous to trust\r\nnear a country store or a stable full of horses. When we first arrived\r\nin the prison quite a crowd of the Savannahians rushed in to inspect\r\nus. The guards had some difficulty in keeping them and us separate.\r\nWhile perplexed with this annoyance, one of them saw Frank standing\r\nin our crowd, and, touching him with his bayonet, said, with some\r\nsharpness:\r\n\r\n“See heah; you must stand back; you musn’t crowd on them prisoners so.”\r\n\r\nFrank stood back. He did it promptly but calmly, and then, as if his\r\ncuriosity as to Yankees was fully satisfied, he walked slowly away up\r\nthe street, deliberating as he went on a plan for getting out of the\r\nCity. He hit upon an excellent one. Going to the engineer of a freight\r\ntrain making ready to start back to Macon, he told him that his father\r\nwas working in the Confederate machine shops at Griswoldville, near\r\nMacon; that he himself was also one of the machinists employed there,\r\nand desired to go thither but lacked the necessary means to pay his\r\npassage. If the engineer would let him ride up on the engine he would\r\ndo work enough to pay the fare. Frank told the story ingeniously, the\r\nengineer and firemen were won over, and gave their consent.\r\n\r\nNo more zealous assistant ever climbed upon a tender than Frank\r\nproved to be. He loaded wood with a nervous industry, that stood him\r\nin place of great strength. He kept the tender in perfect order, and\r\nanticipated, as far as possible, every want of the engineer and his\r\nassistant. They were delighted with him, and treated him with the\r\ngreatest kindness, dividing their food with him, and insisting that\r\nhe should share their bed when they “laid by” for the night. Frank\r\nwould have gladly declined this latter kindness with thanks, as he was\r\nconscious that the quantity of “graybacks” his clothing contained did\r\nnot make him a very desirable sleeping companion for any one, but his\r\nfriends were so pressing that he was compelled to accede.\r\n\r\nHis greatest trouble was a fear of recognition by some one of the\r\nprisoners that were continually passing by the train load, on their\r\nway from Andersonville to other prisons. He was one of the best known\r\nof the prisoners in Andersonville; bright, active, always cheerful,\r\nand forever in motion during waking hours,--every one in the Prison\r\nspeedily became familiar with him, and all addressed him as “Sergeant\r\nFrankie.” If any one on the passing trains had caught a glimpse of him,\r\nthat glimpse would have been followed almost inevitably with a shout of:\r\n\r\n“Hello, Sergeant Frankie! What are you doing there?”\r\n\r\nThen the whole game would have been up. Frank escaped this by\r\npersistent watchfulness, and by busying himself on the opposite side of\r\nthe engine, with his back turned to the other trains.\r\n\r\nAt last when nearing Griswoldville, Frank, pointing to a large white\r\nhouse at some distance across the fields, said:\r\n\r\n“Now, right over there is where my uncle lives, and I believe I’ll just\r\nrun over and see him, and then walk into Griswoldville.”\r\n\r\nHe thanked his friends fervently for their kindness, promised to call\r\nand see them frequently, bade them good by, and jumped off the train.\r\n\r\nHe walked towards the white house as long as he thought he could be\r\nseen, and then entered a large corn field and concealed himself in a\r\nthicket in the center of it until dark, when he made his way to the\r\nneighboring woods, and began journeying northward as fast as his legs\r\ncould carry him. When morning broke he had made good progress, but\r\nwas terribly tired. It was not prudent to travel by daylight, so he\r\ngathered himself some ears of corn and some berries, of which he made\r\nhis breakfast, and finding a suitable thicket he crawled into it, fell\r\nasleep, and did not wake up until late in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nAfter another meal of raw corn and berries he resumed his journey, and\r\nthat night made still better progress.\r\n\r\nHe repeated this for several days and nights--lying in the woods in\r\nthe day time, traveling by night through woods, fields, and by-paths\r\navoiding all the fords, bridges and main roads, and living on what he\r\ncould glean from the fields, that he might not take even so much risk\r\nas was involved in going to the negro cabins for food.\r\n\r\nBut there are always flaws in every man’s armor of caution--even in so\r\nperfect a one as Frank’s. His complete success so far had the natural\r\neffect of inducing a growing carelessness, which wrought his ruin. One\r\nevening he started off briskly, after a refreshing rest and sleep. He\r\nknew that he must be very near Sherman’s lines, and hope cheered him up\r\nwith the belief that his freedom would soon be won.\r\n\r\nDescending from the hill, in whose dense brushwood he had made his\r\nbed all day, he entered a large field full of standing corn, and made\r\nhis way between the rows until he reached, on the other side, the\r\nfence that separated it from the main road, across which was another\r\ncorn-field, that Frank intended entering.\r\n\r\nBut he neglected his usual precautions on approaching a road, and\r\ninstead of coming up cautiously and carefully reconnoitering in all\r\ndirections before he left cover, he sprang boldly over the fence and\r\nstrode out for the other side. As he reached the middle of the road,\r\nhis ears were assailed with the sharp click of a musket being cocked,\r\nand the harsh command:\r\n\r\n“Halt! halt, dah, I say!”\r\n\r\nTurning with a start to his left he saw not ten feet from him, a\r\nmounted patrol, the sound of whose approach had been masked by the deep\r\ndust of the road, into which his horse’s hoofs sank noiselessly.\r\n\r\nFrank, of course, yielded without a word, and when sent to the officer\r\nin command he told the old story about his being an employee of the\r\nGriswoldville shops, off on a leave of absence to make a visit to sick\r\nrelatives. But, unfortunately, his captors belonged to that section\r\nthemselves, and speedily caught him in a maze of cross-questioning from\r\nwhich he could not extricate himself. It also became apparent from his\r\nlanguage that he was a Yankee, and it was not far from this to the\r\nconclusion that he was a spy--a conclusion to which the proximity of\r\nSherman’s lines, then less than twenty miles distant-greatly assisted.\r\n\r\nBy the next morning this belief had become so firmly fixed in the minds\r\nof the Rebels that Frank saw a halter dangling alarmingly near, and he\r\nconcluded the wisest plan was to confess who he really was.\r\n\r\nIt was not the smallest of his griefs to realize by how slight a chance\r\nhe had failed. Had he looked down the road before he climbed the fence,\r\nor had he been ten minutes earlier or later, the patrol would not have\r\nbeen there, he could have gained the next field unperceived, and two\r\nmore nights of successful progress would have taken him into Sherman’s\r\nlines at Sand Mountain. The patrol which caught him was on the look-out\r\nfor deserters and shirking conscripts, who had become unusually\r\nnumerous since the fall of Atlanta.\r\n\r\nHe was sent back to us at Savannah. As he came into the prison gate\r\nLieutenant Davis was standing near. He looked sternly at Frank and his\r\nRebel garments, and muttering,\r\n\r\n“By God, I’ll stop this!” caught the coat by the tails, tore it to the\r\ncollar, and took it and his hat away from Frank.\r\n\r\nThere was a strange sequel to this episode. A few weeks afterward\r\na special exchange for ten thousand was made, and Frank succeeded\r\nin being included in this. He was given the usual furlough from the\r\nparoled camp at Annapolis, and went to his home in a little town near\r\nMansfield, O.\r\n\r\nOne day while on the cars going--I think to Newark, O., he saw\r\nLieutenant Davis on the train, in citizens’ clothes. He had been sent\r\nby the Rebel Government to Canada with dispatches relating to some of\r\nthe raids then harassing our Northern borders. Davis was the last man\r\nin the world to successfully disguise himself. He had a large, coarse\r\nmouth, that made him remembered by all who had ever seen him. Frank\r\nrecognized him instantly and said:\r\n\r\n“You are Lieutenant Davis?”\r\n\r\nDavis replied:\r\n\r\n“You are totally mistaken, sah, I am -----.”\r\n\r\nFrank insisted that he was right. Davis fumed and blustered, but though\r\nFrank was small, he was as game as a bantam rooster, and he gave Davis\r\nto understand that there had been a vast change in their relative\r\npositions; that the one, while still the same insolent swaggerer, had\r\nnot regiments of infantry or batteries of artillery to emphasize his\r\ninsolence, and the other was no longer embarrassed in the discussion by\r\nthe immense odds in favor of his jailor opponent.\r\n\r\nAfter a stormy scene Frank called in the assistance of some other\r\nsoldiers in the car, arrested Davis, and took him to Camp Chase--near\r\nColumbus, O.,--where he was fully identified by a number of paroled\r\nprisoners. He was searched, and documents showing the nature of his\r\nmission beyond a doubt, were found upon his person.\r\n\r\nA court martial was immediately convened for his trial.\r\n\r\nThis found him guilty, and sentenced him to be hanged as a spy.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the trial Frank stepped up to the prisoner and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Davis, I believe we’re even on that coat, now.”\r\n\r\nDavis was sent to Johnson’s Island for execution, but influences were\r\nimmediately set at work to secure Executive clemency. What they were\r\nI know not, but I am informed by the Rev. Robert McCune, who was then\r\nChaplain of the One Hundred and Twenty-Eighth Ohio Infantry and the\r\nPost of Johnson’s Island and who was the spiritual adviser appointed to\r\nprepare Davis for execution, that the sentence was hardly pronounced\r\nbefore Davis was visited by an emissary, who told him to dismiss his\r\nfears, that he should not suffer the punishment.\r\n\r\nIt is likely that leading Baltimore Unionists were enlisted in his\r\nbehalf through family connections, and as the Border State Unionists\r\nwere then potent at Washington, they readily secured a commutation of\r\nhis sentence to imprisonment during the war.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the justice of this world is very unevenly dispensed when\r\nso much solicitude is shown for the life of such a man, and none at all\r\nfor the much better men whom he assisted to destroy.\r\n\r\nThe official notice of the commutation of the sentence was not\r\npublished until the day set for the execution, but the certain\r\nknowledge that it would be forthcoming enabled Davis to display a\r\ngreat deal of bravado on approaching what was supposed to be his end.\r\nAs the reader can readily imagine, from what I have heretofore said\r\nof him, Davis was the man to improve to the utmost every opportunity\r\nto strut his little hour, and he did it in this instance. He posed,\r\nattitudinized and vapored, so that the camp and the country were filled\r\nwith stories of the wonderful coolness with which he contemplated his\r\napproaching fate.\r\n\r\nAmong other things he said to his guard, as he washed himself\r\nelaborately the night before the day announced for the execution:\r\n\r\n“Well, you can be sure of one thing; to-morrow night there will\r\ncertainly be one clean corpse on this Island.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for his braggadocio, he let it leak out in some way that\r\nhe had been well aware all the time that he would not be executed.\r\n\r\nHe was taken to Fort Delaware for confinement, and died there some time\r\nafter.\r\n\r\nFrank Beverstock went back to his regiment, and served with it until\r\nthe close of the war. He then returned home, and, after awhile became\r\na banker at Bowling Green, O. He was a fine business man and became\r\nvery prosperous. But though naturally healthy and vigorous, his system\r\ncarried in it the seeds of death, sown there by the hardships of\r\ncaptivity. He had been one of the victims of the Rebels’ vaccination;\r\nthe virus injected into his blood had caused a large part of his right\r\ntemple to slough off, and when it healed it left a ghastly cicatrix.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago he was taken suddenly ill, and died before his friends\r\nhad any idea that his condition was serious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\n\r\nSAVANNAH PROVES TO BE A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER--ESCAPE FROM THE BRATS\r\nOF GUARDS--COMPARISON BETWEEN WIRZ AND DAVIS--A BRIEF INTERVAL OF GOOD\r\nRATIONS--WINDER, THE MAN WITH THE EVIL EYE--THE DISLOYAL WORK OF A\r\nSHYSTER.\r\n\r\nAfter all Savannah was a wonderful improvement on Andersonville.\r\nWe got away from the pestilential Swamp and that poisonous ground.\r\nEvery mouthful of air was not laden with disease germs, nor every cup\r\nof water polluted with the seeds of death. The earth did not breed\r\ngangrene, nor the atmosphere promote fever. As only the more vigorous\r\nhad come away, we were freed from the depressing spectacle of every\r\nthird man dying. The keen disappointment prostrated very many who had\r\nbeen of average health, and I imagine, several hundred died, but there\r\nwere hospital arrangements of some kind, and the sick were taken away\r\nfrom among us. Those of us who tunneled out had an opportunity of\r\nstretching our legs, which we had not had for months in the overcrowded\r\nStockade we had left. The attempts to escape did all engaged in them\r\ngood, even though they failed, since they aroused new ideas and hopes,\r\nset the blood into more rapid circulation, and toned up the mind and\r\nsystem both. I had come away from Andersonville with considerable\r\nscurvy manifesting itself in my gums and feet. Soon these signs almost\r\nwholly disappeared.\r\n\r\nWe also got away from those murderous little brats of Reserves, who\r\nguarded us at Andersonville, and shot men down as they would stone\r\napples out of a tree. Our guards now were mostly, sailors, from the\r\nRebel fleet in the harbor--Irishmen, Englishmen and Scandinavians, as\r\nfree hearted and kindly as sailors always are. I do not think they\r\never fired a shot at one of us. The only trouble we had was with that\r\nportion of the guard drawn from the infantry of the garrison. They had\r\nthe same rattlesnake venom of the Home Guard crowd wherever we met it,\r\nand shot us down at the least provocation. Fortunately they only formed\r\na small part of the sentinels.\r\n\r\nBest of all, we escaped for a while from the upas-like shadow of Winder\r\nand Wirz, in whose presence strong men sickened and died, as when near\r\nsome malign genii of an Eastern story. The peasantry of Italy believed\r\nfirmly in the evil eye. Did they ever know any such men as Winder and\r\nhis satellite, I could comprehend how much foundation they could have\r\nfor such a belief.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Davis had many faults, but there was no comparison between\r\nhim and the Andersonville commandant. He was a typical young Southern\r\nman; ignorant and bumptious as to the most common matters of school-boy\r\nknowledge, inordinately vain of himself and his family, coarse in\r\ntastes and thoughts, violent in his prejudices, but after all with\r\nsome streaks of honor and generosity that made the widest possible\r\ndifference between him and Wirz, who never had any. As one of my chums\r\nsaid to me:\r\n\r\n“Wirz is the most even-tempered man I ever knew; he’s always foaming\r\nmad.”\r\n\r\nThis was nearly the truth. I never saw Wirz when he was not angry; if\r\nnot violently abusive, he was cynical and sardonic. Never, in my little\r\nexperience with him did I detect a glint of kindly, generous humanity;\r\nif he ever was moved by any sight of suffering its exhibition in his\r\nface escaped my eye. If he ever had even a wish to mitigate the pain or\r\nhardship of any man the expression of such wish never fell on my ear.\r\nHow a man could move daily through such misery as he encountered, and\r\nnever be moved by it except to scorn and mocking is beyond my limited\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\nDavis vapored a great deal, swearing big round oaths in the broadest of\r\nSouthern patois; he was perpetually threatening to:\r\n\r\n“Open on ye wid de ahtillery,” but the only death that I knew him to\r\ndirectly cause or sanction was that I have described in the previous\r\nchapter. He would not put himself out of the way to annoy and oppress\r\nprisoners, as Wirz would, but frequently showed even a disposition to\r\nhumor them in some little thing, when it could be done without danger\r\nor trouble to himself.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by, however, he got an idea that there was some money to be made\r\nout of the prisoners, and he set his wits to work in this direction.\r\nOne day, standing at the gate, he gave one of his peculiar yells that\r\nhe used to attract the attention of the camp with:\r\n\r\n“Wh-ah-ye!!”\r\n\r\nWe all came to “attention,” and he announced:\r\n\r\n“Yesterday, while I wuz in the camps (a Rebel always says camps,)\r\nsome of you prisoners picked my pockets of seventy-five dollars in\r\ngreenbacks. Now, I give you notice that I’ll not send in any moah\r\nrations till the money’s returned to me.”\r\n\r\nThis was a very stupid method of extortion, since no one believed that\r\nhe had lost the money, and at all events he had no business to have\r\nthe greenbacks, as the Rebel laws imposed severe penalties upon any\r\ncitizen, and still more upon any soldier dealing with, or having in\r\nhis possession any of “the money of the enemy.” We did without rations\r\nuntil night, when they were sent in. There was a story that some of\r\nthe boys in the prison had contributed to make up part of the sum, and\r\nDavis took it and was satisfied. I do not know how true the story was.\r\nAt another time some of the boys stole the bridle and halter off an\r\nold horse that was driven in with a cart. The things were worth, at a\r\nliberal estimate, one dollar. Davis cut off the rations of the whole\r\nsix thousand of us for one day for this. We always imagined that the\r\nproceeds went into his pocket.\r\n\r\nA special exchange was arranged between our Navy Department and\r\nthat of the Rebels, by which all seamen and marines among us were\r\nexchanged. Lists of these were sent to the different prisons and\r\nthe men called for. About three-fourths of them were dead, but many\r\nsoldiers divining, the situation of affairs, answered to the dead men’s\r\nnames, went away with the squad and were exchanged. Much of this was\r\nthrough the connivance of the Rebel officers, who favored those who\r\nhad ingratiated themselves with them. In many instances money was paid\r\nto secure this privilege, and I have been informed on good authority\r\nthat Jack Huckleby, of the Eighth Tennessee, and Ira Beverly, of the\r\nOne Hundredth Ohio, who kept the big sutler shop on the North Side at\r\nAndersonville, paid Davis five hundred dollars each to be allowed to go\r\nwith the sailors. As for Andrews and me, we had no friends among the\r\nRebels, nor money to bribe with, so we stood no show.\r\n\r\nThe rations issued to us for some time after our arrival seemed\r\nriotous luxury to what we had been getting at Andersonville. Each\r\nof us received daily a half-dozen rude and coarse imitations of our\r\nfondly-remembered hard tack, and with these a small piece of meat or a\r\nfew spoonfuls of molasses, and a quart or so of vinegar, and several\r\nplugs of tobacco for each “hundred.” How exquisite was the taste of the\r\ncrackers and molasses!\r\n\r\nIt was the first wheat bread I had eaten since my entry into Richmond\r\n--nine months before--and molasses had been a stranger to me for\r\nyears. After the corn bread we had so long lived upon, this was manna.\r\nIt seems that the Commissary at Savannah labored under the delusion\r\nthat he must issue to us the same rations as were served out to\r\nthe Rebel soldiers and sailors. It was some little time before the\r\nfearful mistake came to the knowledge of Winder. I fancy that the\r\nnews almost threw him into an apoplectic fit. Nothing, save his being\r\nordered to the front, could have caused him such poignant sorrow as\r\nthe information that so much good food had been worse than wasted in\r\nundoing his work by building up the bodies of his hated enemies.\r\n\r\nWithout being told, we knew that he had been heard from when the\r\ntobacco, vinegar and molasses failed to come in, and the crackers gave\r\nway to corn meal. Still this was a vast improvement on Andersonville,\r\nas the meal was fine and sweet, and we each had a spoonful of salt\r\nissued to us regularly.\r\n\r\nI am quite sure that I cannot make the reader who has not had an\r\nexperience similar to ours comprehend the wonderful importance to us\r\nof that spoonful of salt. Whether or not the appetite for salt be, as\r\nsome scientists claim, a purely artificial want, one thing is certain,\r\nand that is, that either the habit of countless generations or some\r\nother cause, has so deeply ingrained it into our common nature, that\r\nit has come to be nearly as essential as food itself, and no amount of\r\ndeprivation can accustom us to its absence. Rather, it seemed that the\r\nlonger we did without it the more overpowering became our craving. I\r\ncould get along to-day and to-morrow, perhaps the whole week, without\r\nsalt in my food, since the lack would be supplied from the excess I\r\nhad already swallowed, but at the end of that time Nature would begin\r\nto demand that I renew the supply of saline constituent of my tissues,\r\nand she would become more clamorous with every day that I neglected her\r\nbidding, and finally summon Nausea to aid Longing.\r\n\r\nThe light artillery of the garrison of Savannah--four batteries,\r\ntwenty-four pieces--was stationed around three sides of the prison, the\r\nguns unlimbered, planted at convenient distance, and trained upon us,\r\nready for instant use. We could see all the grinning mouths through\r\nthe cracks in the fence. There were enough of them to send us as high\r\nas the traditional kite flown by Gilderoy. The having at his beck this\r\narray of frowning metal lent Lieutenant Davis such an importance in\r\nhis own eyes that his demeanor swelled to the grandiose. It became\r\nvery amusing to see him puff up and vaunt over it, as he did on every\r\npossible occasion. For instance, finding a crowd of several hundred\r\nlounging around the gate, he would throw open the wicket, stalk in\r\nwith the air of a Jove threatening a rebellious world with the dread\r\nthunders of heaven, and shout:\r\n\r\n“W-h-a-a y-e-e! Prisoners, I give you jist two minutes to cleah away\r\nfrom this gate, aw I’ll open on ye wid de ahtillery!”\r\n\r\nOne of the buglers of the artillery was a superb musician--evidently\r\nsome old “regular” whom the Confederacy had seduced into its service,\r\nand his instrument was so sweet toned that we imagined that it was made\r\nof silver. The calls he played were nearly the same as we used in the\r\ncavalry, and for the first few days we became bitterly homesick every\r\ntime he sent ringing out the old familiar signals, that to us were\r\nso closely associated with what now seemed the bright and happy days\r\nwhen we were in the field with our battalion. If we were only back in\r\nthe valleys of Tennessee with what alacrity we would respond to that\r\n“assembly;” no Orderly’s patience would be worn out in getting laggards\r\nand lazy ones to “fall in for roll-call;” how eagerly we would attend\r\nto “stable duty;” how gladly mount our faithful horses and ride away to\r\n“water,” and what bareback races ride, going and coming. We would be\r\neven glad to hear “guard” and “drill” sounded; and there would be music\r\nin the disconsolate “surgeon’s call:”\r\n\r\n    “Come-get-your-q-n-i-n-i-n-e; come, get your quinine; It’ll make you\r\n    sad: It’ll make you sick. Come, come.”\r\n\r\nO, if we were only back, what admirable soldiers we would be! One\r\nmorning, about three or four o’clock, we were awakened by the ground\r\nshaking and a series of heavy, dull thumps sounding oft seaward. Our\r\nsilver-voiced bugler seemed to be awakened, too. He set the echoes\r\nringing with a vigorously played “reveille;” a minute later came an\r\nequally earnest “assembly,” and when “boots and saddles” followed, we\r\nknew that all was not well in Denmark; the thumping and shaking now had\r\na significance. It meant heavy Yankee guns somewhere near. We heard\r\nthe gunners hitching up; the bugle signal “forward,” the wheels roll\r\noff, and for a half hour afterwards we caught the receding sound of\r\nthe bugle commanding “right turn,” “left turn,” etc., as the batteries\r\nmarched away. Of course, we became considerably wrought up over the\r\nmatter, as we fancied that, knowing we were in Savannah, our vessels\r\nwere trying to pass up to the City and take it. The thumping and\r\nshaking continued until late in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nWe subsequently learned that some of our blockaders, finding time\r\nbanging heavy upon their hands, had essayed a little diversion by\r\nknocking Forts Jackson and Bledsoe--two small forts defending the\r\npassage of the Savannah--about their defenders’ ears. After capturing\r\nthe forts our folks desisted and came no farther.\r\n\r\nQuite a number of the old Raider crowd had come with us from\r\nAndersonville. Among these was the shyster, Peter Bradley. They kept up\r\ntheir old tactics of hanging around the gates, and currying favor with\r\nthe Rebels in every possible way, in hopes to get paroles outside or\r\nother favors. The great mass of the prisoners were so bitter against\r\nthe Rebels as to feel that they would rather die than ask or accept\r\na favor from their hands, and they had little else than contempt for\r\nthese trucklers. The raider crowd’s favorite theme of conversation\r\nwith the Rebels was the strong discontent of the boys with the manner\r\nof their treatment by our Government. The assertion that there was any\r\nsuch widespread feeling was utterly false. We all had confidence--as we\r\ncontinue to have to this day--that our Government would do everything\r\nfor us possible, consistent with its honor, and the success of military\r\noperations, and outside of the little squad of which I speak, not\r\nan admission could be extracted from anybody that blame could be\r\nattached to any one, except the Rebels. It was regarded as unmanly and\r\nunsoldier-like to the last degree, as well as senseless, to revile our\r\nGovernment for the crimes committed by its foes.\r\n\r\nBut the Rebels were led to believe that we were ripe for revolt against\r\nour flag, and to side with them. Imagine, if possible, the stupidity\r\nthat would mistake our bitter hatred of those who were our deadly\r\nenemies, for any feeling that would lead us to join hands with those\r\nenemies. One day we were surprised to see the carpenters erect a rude\r\nstand in the center of the camp. When it was finished, Bradley appeared\r\nupon it, in company with some Rebel officers and guards. We gathered\r\naround in curiosity, and Bradley began making a speech.\r\n\r\nHe said that it had now become apparent to all of us that our\r\nGovernment had abandoned us; that it cared little or nothing for us,\r\nsince it could hire as many more quite readily, by offering a bounty\r\nequal to the pay which would be due us now; that it cost only a few\r\nhundred dollars to bring over a shipload of Irish, “Dutch,” and French,\r\nwho were only too glad to agree to fight or do anything else to get\r\nto this country. [The peculiar impudence of this consisted in Bradley\r\nhimself being a foreigner, and one who had only come out under one of\r\nthe later calls, and the influence of a big bounty.]\r\n\r\nContinuing in this strain he repeated and dwelt upon the old lie,\r\nalways in the mouths of his crowd, that Secretary Stanton and General\r\nHalleck had positively refused to enter upon negotiations for exchange,\r\nbecause those in prison were “only a miserable lot of ‘coffee-boilers’\r\nand ‘blackberry pickers,’ whom the Army was better off without.”\r\n\r\nThe terms “coffee-boiler,” and “blackberry-pickers” were considered\r\nthe worst terms of opprobrium we had in prison. They were applied to\r\nthat class of stragglers and skulkers, who were only too ready to give\r\nthemselves up to the enemy, and who, on coming in, told some gauzy\r\nstory about “just having stopped to boil a cup of coffee,” or to do\r\nsomething else which they should not have done, when they were gobbled\r\nup. It is not risking much to affirm the probability of Bradley and\r\nmost of his crowd having belonged to this dishonorable class.\r\n\r\nThe assertion that either the great Chief-of-Staff or the still greater\r\nWar-Secretary were even capable of applying such epithets to the mass\r\nof prisoners is too preposterous to need refutation, or even denial.\r\nNo person outside the raider crowd ever gave the silly lie a moment’s\r\ntoleration.\r\n\r\nBradley concluded his speech in some such language as this:\r\n\r\n“And now, fellow prisoners, I propose to you this: that we unite in\r\ninforming our Government that unless we are exchanged in thirty days,\r\nwe will be forced by self-preservation to join the Confederate army.”\r\n\r\nFor an instant his hearers seemed stunned at the fellow’s audacity, and\r\nthen there went up such a roar of denunciation and execration that the\r\nair trembled. The Rebels thought that the whole camp was going to rush\r\non Bradley and tear him to pieces, and they drew revolvers and leveled\r\nmuskets to defend him. The uproar only ceased when Bradley was hurried\r\nout of the prisons but for hours everybody was savage and sullen, and\r\nfull of threatenings against him, when opportunity served. We never saw\r\nhim afterward.\r\n\r\nAngry as I was, I could not help being amused at the tempestuous rage\r\nof a tall, fine-looking and well educated Irish Sergeant of an Illinois\r\nregiment. He poured forth denunciations of the traitor and the Rebels,\r\nwith the vivid fluency of his Hibernian nature, vowed he’d “give a year\r\nof me life, be J---s, to have the handling of the dirty spalpeen for\r\nten minutes; be G-d,” and finally in his rage, tore off his own shirt\r\nand threw it on the ground and trampled on it.\r\n\r\nImagine my astonishment, some time after getting out of prison, to find\r\nthe Southern papers publishing as a defense against the charges in\r\nregard to Andersonville, the following document, which they claimed to\r\nhave been adopted by “a mass meeting of the prisoners:”\r\n\r\n“At a mass meeting held September 28th, 1864, by the Federal prisoners\r\nconfined at Savannah, Ga., it was unanimously agreed that the following\r\nresolutions be sent to the President of the United States, in the hope\r\nthat he might thereby take such steps as in his wisdom he may think\r\nnecessary for our speedy exchange or parole:\r\n\r\n“Resolved, That while we would declare our unbounded love for the\r\nUnion, for the home of our fathers, and for the graves of those\r\nwe venerate, we would beg most respectfully that our situation as\r\nprisoners be diligently inquired into, and every obstacle consistent\r\nwith the honor and dignity of the Government at once removed.\r\n\r\n“Resolved, That while allowing the Confederate authorities all due\r\npraise for the attention paid to prisoners, numbers of our men are\r\ndaily consigned to early graves, in the prime of manhood, far from home\r\nand kindred, and this is not caused intentionally by the Confederate\r\nGovernment, but by force of circumstances; the prisoners are forced to\r\ngo without shelter, and, in a great portion of cases, without medicine.\r\n\r\n“Resolved, That, whereas, ten thousand of our brave comrades have\r\ndescended into an untimely grave within the last six months, and as\r\nwe believe their death was caused by the difference of climate, the\r\npeculiar kind and insufficiency of food, and lack of proper medical\r\ntreatment; and, whereas, those difficulties still remain, we would\r\ndeclare as our firm belief, that unless we are speedily exchanged, we\r\nhave no alternative but to share the lamentable fate of our comrades.\r\nMust this thing still go on! Is there no hope?\r\n\r\n“Resolved, That, whereas, the cold and inclement season of the year is\r\nfast approaching, we hold it to be our duty as soldiers and citizens\r\nof the United States, to inform our Government that the majority of\r\nour prisoners ate without proper clothing, in some cases being almost\r\nnaked, and are without blankets to protect us from the scorching sun by\r\nday or the heavy dews by night, and we would most respectfully request\r\nthe Government to make some arrangement whereby we can be supplied with\r\nthese, to us, necessary articles.\r\n\r\n“Resolved, That, whereas, the term of service of many of our comrades\r\nhaving expired, they, having served truly and faithfully for the\r\nterm of their several enlistments, would most respectfully ask their\r\nGovernment, are they to be forgotten? Are past services to be ignored?\r\nNot having seen their wives and little ones for over three years, they\r\nwould most respectfully, but firmly, request the Government to make\r\nsome arrangements whereby they can be exchanged or paroled.\r\n\r\n“Resolved, That, whereas, in the fortune of war, it was our lot to\r\nbecome prisoners, we have suffered patiently, and are still willing to\r\nsuffer, if by so doing we can benefit the country; but we must most\r\nrespectfully beg to say, that we are not willing to suffer to further\r\nthe ends of any party or clique to the detriment of our honor, our\r\nfamilies, and our country, and we beg that this affair be explained to\r\nus, that we may continue to hold the Government in that respect which\r\nis necessary to make a good citizen and soldier.\r\n\r\n                                   “P. BRADLEY,\r\n\r\n                    “Chairman of Committee in behalf of Prisoners.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn regard to the above I will simply say this, that while I cannot\r\npretend to know or even much that went on around me, I do not think it\r\nwas possible for a mass meeting of prisoners to have been held without\r\nmy knowing it, and its essential features. Still less was it possible\r\nfor a mass meeting to have been held which would have adopted any such\r\na document as the above, or anything else that a Rebel would have\r\nfound the least pleasure in republishing. The whole thing is a brazen\r\nfalsehood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.\r\n\r\nWHY WE WERE HURRIED OUT OF ANDERSONVILLE--THE FALL OF ATLANTA\r\n--OUR LONGING TO HEAR THE NEWS--ARRIVAL OF SOME FRESH FISH--HOW WE KNEW\r\nTHEY WERE WESTERN BOYS--DIFFERENCE IN THE APPEARANCE OF THE SOLDIERS OF\r\nTHE TWO ARMIES.\r\n\r\nThe reason of our being hurried out of Andersonville under the false\r\npretext of exchange dawned on us before we had been in Savannah long.\r\nIf the reader will consult the map of Georgia he will understand this,\r\ntoo. Let him remember that several of the railroads which now appear\r\nwere not built then. The road upon which Andersonville is situated\r\nwas about one hundred and twenty miles long, reaching from Macon to\r\nAmericus, Andersonville being about midway between these two. It had\r\nno connections anywhere except at Macon, and it was hundreds of miles\r\nacross the country from Andersonville to any other road. When Atlanta\r\nfell it brought our folks to within sixty miles of Macon, and any day\r\nthey were liable to make a forward movement, which would capture that\r\nplace, and have us where we could be retaken with ease.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing left undone to rouse the apprehensions of the Rebels\r\nin that direction. The humiliating surrender of General Stoneman\r\nat Macon in July, showed them what our folks were thinking of, and\r\nawakened their minds to the disastrous consequences of such a movement\r\nwhen executed by a bolder and abler commander. Two days of one of\r\nKilpatrick’s swift, silent marches would carry his hard-riding troopers\r\naround Hood’s right flank, and into the streets of Macon, where a\r\nhalf hour’s work with the torch on the bridges across the Ocmulgee\r\nand the creeks that enter it at that point, would have cut all of the\r\nConfederate Army of the Tennessee’s communications. Another day and\r\nnight of easy marching would bring his guidons fluttering through the\r\nwoods about the Stockade at Andersonville, and give him a reinforcement\r\nof twelve or fifteen thousand able-bodied soldiers, with whom he could\r\nhave held the whole Valley of the Chattahoochie, and become the nether\r\nmillstone, against which Sherman could have ground Hood’s army to\r\npowder.\r\n\r\nSuch a thing was not only possible, but very probable, and doubtless\r\nwould have occurred had we remained in Andersonville another week.\r\n\r\nHence the haste to get us away, and hence the lie about exchange, for,\r\nhad it not been for this, one-quarter at least of those taken on the\r\ncars would have succeeded in getting off and attempted to have reached\r\nSherman’s lines.\r\n\r\nThe removal went on with such rapidity that by the end of September\r\nonly eight thousand two hundred and eighteen remained at Andersonville,\r\nand these were mostly too sick to be moved; two thousand seven hundred\r\ndied in September, fifteen hundred and sixty in October, and four\r\nhundred and eighty-five in November, so that at the beginning of\r\nDecember there were only thirteen hundred and fifty-nine remaining.\r\nThe larger part of those taken out were sent on to Charleston, and\r\nsubsequently to Florence and Salisbury. About six or seven thousand of\r\nus, as near as I remember, were brought to Savannah.\r\n\r\n                         .......................\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were all exceedingly anxious to know how the Atlanta campaign had\r\nended. So far our information only comprised the facts that a sharp\r\nbattle had been fought, and the result was the complete possession of\r\nour great objective point. The manner of accomplishing this glorious\r\nend, the magnitude of the engagement, the regiments, brigades and\r\ncorps participating, the loss on both sides, the completeness of the\r\nvictories, etc., were all matters that we knew nothing of, and thirsted\r\nto learn.\r\n\r\nThe Rebel papers said as little as possible about the capture, and the\r\nfacts in that little were so largely diluted with fiction as to convey\r\nno real information. But few new, prisoners were coming in, and none\r\nof these were from Sherman. However, toward the last of September, a\r\nhandful of “fresh fish” were turned inside, whom our experienced eyes\r\ninstantly told us were Western boys.\r\n\r\nThere was never any difficulty in telling, as far as he could be\r\nseen, whether a boy belonged to the East or the west. First, no one\r\nfrom the Army of the Potomac was ever without his corps badge worn\r\nconspicuously; it was rare to see such a thing on one of Sherman’s men.\r\nThen there was a dressy air about the Army of the Potomac that was\r\nwholly wanting in the soldiers serving west of the Alleghanies.\r\n\r\nThe Army, of the Potomac was always near to its base of supplies,\r\nalways had its stores accessible, and the care of the clothing and\r\nequipments of the men was an essential part of its discipline. A ragged\r\nor shabbily dressed man was a rarity. Dress coats, paper collars,\r\nfresh woolen shirts, neat-fitting pantaloons, good comfortable shoes,\r\nand trim caps or hats, with all the blazing brass of company letters\r\nan inch long, regimental number, bugle and eagle, according to the\r\nRegulations, were as common to Eastern boys as they were rare among the\r\nWesterners.\r\n\r\nThe latter usually wore blouses, instead of dress coats, and as a rule\r\ntheir clothing had not been renewed since the opening, of the campaign\r\n--and it showed this. Those who wore good boots or shoes generally had\r\nto submit to forcible exchanges by their captors, and the same was true\r\nof head gear. The Rebels were badly off in regard to hats. They did not\r\nhave skill and ingenuity enough to make these out of felt or straw, and\r\nthe make-shifts they contrived of quilted calico and long-leaved pine,\r\nwere ugly enough to frighten horned cattle.\r\n\r\nI never blamed them much for wanting to get rid of these, even if they\r\ndid have to commit a sort of highway robbery upon defenseless prisoners\r\nto do so. To be a traitor in arms was bad certainly, but one never\r\nappreciated the entire magnitude of the crime until he saw a Rebel\r\nwearing a calico or a pine-leaf hat. Then one felt as if it would be a\r\ngreat mistake to ever show such a man mercy.\r\n\r\nThe Army of Northern Virginia seemed to have supplied themselves with\r\nhead-gear of Yankee manufacture of previous years, and they then quit\r\ntaking the hats of their prisoners. Johnston’s Army did not have such\r\ngood luck, and had to keep plundering to the end of the war.\r\n\r\nAnother thing about the Army of the Potomac was the variety of the\r\nuniforms. There were members of Zouave regiments, wearing baggy\r\nbreeches of various hues, gaiters, crimson fezes, and profusely braided\r\njackets. I have before mentioned the queer garb of the “Lost Ducks.”\r\n(Les Enfants Perdu, Forty-eighth New York.)\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking uniforms was that of the “Fourteenth\r\nBrooklyn.” They wore scarlet pantaloons, a blue jacket handsomely\r\nbraided, and a red fez, with a white cloth wrapped around the head,\r\nturban-fashion. As a large number of them were captured, they formed\r\nquite a picturesque feature of every crowd. They were generally good\r\nfellows and gallant soldiers.\r\n\r\nAnother uniform that attracted much, though not so favorable, attention\r\nwas that of the Third New Jersey Cavalry, or First New Jersey Hussars,\r\nas they preferred to call themselves. The designer of the uniform\r\nmust have had an interest in a curcuma plantation, or else he was a\r\nfanatical Orangeman. Each uniform would furnish occasion enough for a\r\ndozen New York riots on the 12th of July. Never was such an eruption\r\nof the yellows seen outside of the jaundiced livery of some Eastern\r\npotentate. Down each leg of the pantaloons ran a stripe of yellow braid\r\none and one-half inches wide. The jacket had enormous gilt buttons,\r\nand was embellished with yellow braid until it was difficult to tell\r\nwhether it was blue cloth trimmed with yellow, or yellow adorned with\r\nblue. From the shoulders swung a little, false hussar jacket, lined\r\nwith the same flaring yellow. The vizor-less cap was similarly warmed\r\nup with the hue of the perfected sunflower. Their saffron magnificence\r\nwas like the gorgeous gold of the lilies of the field, and Solomon in\r\nall his glory could not have beau arrayed like one of them. I hope he\r\nwas not. I want to retain my respect for him. We dubbed these daffodil\r\ncavaliers “Butterflies,” and the name stuck to them like a poor\r\nrelation.\r\n\r\nStill another distinction that was always noticeable between the two\r\narmies was in the bodily bearing of the men. The Army of the Potomac\r\nwas drilled more rigidly than the Western men, and had comparatively\r\nfew long marches. Its members had something of the stiffness and\r\nprecision of English and German soldiery, while the Western boys had\r\nthe long, “reachy” stride, and easy swing that made forty miles a day a\r\nrather commonplace march for an infantry regiment.\r\n\r\nThis was why we knew the new prisoners to be Sherman’s boys as soon as\r\nthey came inside, and we started for them to hear the news. Inviting\r\nthem over to our lean-to, we told them our anxiety for the story of the\r\ndecisive blow that gave us the Central Gate of the Confederacy, and\r\nasked them to give it to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\n\r\nWHAT CAUSED THE FALL OF ATLANTA--A DISSERTATION UPON AN IMPORTANT\r\nPSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEM--THE BATTLE OF JONESBORO--WHY IT WAS FOUGHT\r\n--HOW SHERMAN DECEIVED HOOD--A DESPERATE BAYONET CHARGE, AND THE ONLY\r\nSUCCESSFUL ONE IN THE ATLANTA CAMPAIGN--A GALLANT COLONEL AND HOW HE\r\nDIED--THE HEROISM OF SOME ENLISTED MEN--GOING CALMLY INTO CERTAIN DEATH.\r\n\r\nAn intelligent, quick-eyed, sunburned boy, without an ounce of\r\nsurplus flesh on face or limbs, which had been reduced to gray-hound\r\ncondition by the labors and anxieties of the months of battling between\r\nChattanooga and Atlanta, seemed to be the accepted talker of the crowd,\r\nsince all the rest looked at him, as if expecting him to answer for\r\nthem. He did so:\r\n\r\n“You want to know about how we got Atlanta at last, do you? Well, if\r\nyou don’t know, I should think you would want to. If I didn’t, I’d want\r\nsomebody to tell me all about it just as soon as he could get to me,\r\nfor it was one of the neatest little bits of work that ‘old Billy’ and\r\nhis boys ever did, and it got away with Hood so bad that he hardly knew\r\nwhat hurt him.\r\n\r\n“Well, first, I’ll tell you that we belong to the old Fourteenth\r\nOhio Volunteers, which, if you know anything about the Army of the\r\nCumberland, you’ll remember has just about as good a record as any that\r\ntrains around old Pap Thomas--and he don’t ’low no slouches of any kind\r\nnear him, either--you can bet $500 to a cent on that, and offer to give\r\nback the cent if you win. Ours is Jim Steedman’s old regiment--you’ve\r\nall heard of old Chickamauga Jim, who slashed his division of 7,000\r\nfresh men into the Rebel flank on the second day at Chickamauga, in a\r\nway that made Longstreet wish he’d staid on the Rappahannock, and never\r\ntried to get up any little sociable with the Westerners. If I do say\r\nit myself, I believe we’ve got as good a crowd of square, stand-up,\r\ntrust ’em-every-minute-in-your-life boys, as ever thawed hard-tack and\r\nsowbelly. We got all the grunters and weak sisters fanned out the first\r\nyear, and since then we’ve been on a business basis, all the time.\r\nWe’re in a mighty good brigade, too. Most of the regiments have been\r\nwith us since we formed the first brigade Pap Thomas ever commanded,\r\nand waded with him through the mud of Kentucky, from Wild Cat to Mill\r\nSprings, where he gave Zollicoffer just a little the awfulest thrashing\r\nthat a Rebel General ever got. That, you know, was in January, 1862,\r\nand was the first victory gained by the Western Army, and our people\r\nfelt so rejoiced over it that--”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes; we’ve read all about that,” we broke in, “and we’d like to\r\nhear it again, some other time; but tell us now about Atlanta.”\r\n\r\n“All right. Let’s see: where was I? O, yes, talking about our brigade.\r\nIt is the Third Brigade, of the Third Division, of the Fourteenth\r\nCorps, and is made up of the Fourteenth Ohio, Thirty-eighth Ohio, Tenth\r\nKentucky, and Seventy-fourth Indiana. Our old Colonel--George P. Este\r\n--commands it. We never liked him very well in camp, but I tell you\r\nhe’s a whole team in a fight, and he’d do so well there that all would\r\ntake to him again, and he’d be real popular for a while.”\r\n\r\n“Now, isn’t that strange,” broke in Andrews, who was given to fits of\r\nspeculation of psychological phenomena: “None of us yearn to die, but\r\nthe surest way to gain the affection of the boys is to show zeal in\r\nleading them into scrapes where the chances of getting shot are the\r\nbest. Courage in action, like charity, covers a multitude of sins. I\r\nhave known it to make the most unpopular man in the battalion, the most\r\npopular inside of half an hour. Now, M.(addressing himself to me,)\r\nyou remember Lieutenant H., of our battalion. You know he was a very\r\nfancy young fellow; wore as snipish’ clothes as the tailor could make,\r\nhad gold lace on his jacket wherever the regulations would allow it,\r\ndecorated his shoulders with the stunningest pair of shoulder knots I\r\never saw, and so on. Well, he did not stay with us long after we went\r\nto the front. He went back on a detail for a court martial, and staid\r\na good while. When he rejoined us, he was not in good odor, at all,\r\nand the boys weren’t at all careful in saying unpleasant things when\r\nhe could hear them, A little while after he came back we made that\r\nreconnaissance up on the Virginia Road. We stirred up the Johnnies with\r\nour skirmish line, and while the firing was going on in front we sat on\r\nour horses in line, waiting for the order to move forward and engage.\r\nYou know how solemn such moments are. I looked down the line and saw\r\nLieutenant H. at the right of Company --, in command of it. I had not\r\nseen him since he came back, and I sung out:\r\n\r\n“‘Hello, Lieutenant, how do you feel?’\r\n\r\n“The reply came back, promptly, and with boyish cheerfulness:\r\n\r\n“‘Bully, by ----; I’m going to lead seventy men of Company into action\r\ntoday!’\r\n\r\n“How his boys did cheer him. When the bugle sounded--‘forward, trot,’\r\nhis company sailed in as if they meant it, and swept the Johnnies off\r\nin short meter. You never heard anybody say anything against Lieutenant\r\nafter that.”\r\n\r\n“You know how it was with Captain G., of our regiment,” said one of\r\nthe Fourteenth to another. “He was promoted from Orderly Sergeant to\r\na Second Lieutenant, and assigned to Company D. All the members of\r\nCompany D went to headquarters in a body, and protested against his\r\nbeing put in their company, and he was not. Well, he behaved so well at\r\nChickamauga that the boys saw that they had done him a great injustice,\r\nand all those that still lived went again to headquarters, and asked to\r\ntake all back that they had said, and to have him put into the company.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that was doing the manly thing, sure; but go on about Atlanta.”\r\n\r\n“I was telling about our brigade,” resumed the narrator. “Of course, we\r\nthink our regiment’s the best by long odds in the army--every fellow\r\nthinks that of his regiment--but next to it come the other regiments of\r\nour brigade. There’s not a cent of discount on any of them.\r\n\r\n“Sherman had stretched out his right away to the south and west of\r\nAtlanta. About the middle of August our corps, commanded by Jefferson\r\nC. Davis, was lying in works at Utoy Creek, a couple of miles from\r\nAtlanta. We could see the tall steeples and the high buildings of the\r\nCity quite plainly. Things had gone on dull and quiet like for about\r\nten days. This was longer by a good deal than we had been at rest since\r\nwe left Resaca in the Spring. We knew that something was brewing, and\r\nthat it must come to a head soon.\r\n\r\n“I belong to Company C. Our little mess--now reduced to three by the\r\nloss of two of our best soldiers and cooks, Disbrow and Sulier, killed\r\nbehind head-logs in front of Atlanta, by sharpshooters--had one fellow\r\nthat we called ‘Observer,’ because he had such a faculty of picking\r\nup news in his prowling around headquarters. He brought us in so much\r\nof this, and it was generally so reliable that we frequently made up\r\nhis absence from duty by taking his place. He was never away from a\r\nfight, though. On the night of the 25th of August, ‘Observer’ came in\r\nwith the news that something was in the wind. Sherman was getting awful\r\nrestless, and we had found out that this always meant lots of trouble\r\nto our friends on the other side.\r\n\r\n“Sure enough, orders came to get ready to move, and the next night we\r\nall moved to the right and rear, out of sight of the Johnnies. Our well\r\nbuilt works were left in charge of Garrard’s Cavalry, who concealed\r\ntheir horses in the rear, and came up and took our places. The whole\r\narmy except the Twentieth Corps moved quietly off, and did it so nicely\r\nthat we were gone some time before the enemy suspected it. Then the\r\nTwentieth Corps pulled out towards the North, and fell back to the\r\nChattahoochie, making quite a shove of retreat. The Rebels snapped up\r\nthe bait greedily. They thought the siege was being raised, and they\r\npoured over their works to hurry the Twentieth boys off. The Twentieth\r\nfellows let them know that there was lots of sting in them yet, and the\r\nJohnnies were not long in discovering that it would have been money\r\nin their pockets if they had let that ‘moon-and-star’ (that’s the\r\nTwentieth’s badge, you know) crowd alone.\r\n\r\n“But the Rebs thought the rest of us were gone for good and that\r\nAtlanta was saved. Naturally they felt mighty happy over it; and\r\nresolved to have a big celebration--a ball, a meeting of jubilee, etc.\r\nExtra trains were run in, with girls and women from the surrounding\r\ncountry, and they just had a high old time.\r\n\r\n“In the meantime we were going through so many different kinds of\r\ntactics that it looked as if Sherman was really crazy this time, sure.\r\nFinally we made a grand left wheel, and then went forward a long way\r\nin line of battle. It puzzled us a good deal, but we knew that Sherman\r\ncouldn’t get us into any scrape that Pap Thomas couldn’t get us out of,\r\nand so it was all right.\r\n\r\n“Along on the evening of the 31st our right wing seemed to have run\r\nagainst a hornet’s nest, and we could hear the musketry and cannon\r\nspeak out real spiteful, but nothing came down our way. We had struck\r\nthe railroad leading south from Atlanta to Macon, and began tearing\r\nit up. The jollity at Atlanta was stopped right in the middle by the\r\nappalling news that the Yankees hadn’t retreated worth a cent, but had\r\nbroken out in a new and much worse spot than ever. Then there was no\r\nend of trouble all around, and Hood started part of his army back after\r\nus.\r\n\r\n“Part of Hardee’s and Pat Cleburne’s command went into position in\r\nfront of us. We left them alone till Stanley could come up on our left,\r\nand swing around, so as to cut off their retreat, when we would bag\r\nevery one of them. But Stanley was as slow as he always was, and did\r\nnot come up until it was too late, and the game was gone.\r\n\r\n“The sun was just going down on the evening of the 1st of September,\r\nwhen we began to see we were in for it, sure. The Fourteenth Corps\r\nwheeled into position near the railroad, and the sound of musketry and\r\nartillery became very loud and clear on our front and left. We turned\r\na little and marched straight toward the racket, becoming more excited\r\nevery minute. We saw the Carlin’s brigade of regulars, who were some\r\ndistance ahead of us, pile knapsacks, form in line, fix bayonets, and\r\ndash off with arousing cheer.\r\n\r\n“The Rebel fire beat upon them like a Summer rain-storm, the ground\r\nshook with the noise, and just as we reached the edge of the cotton\r\nfield, we saw the remnant of the brigade come flying back out of the\r\nawful, blasting shower of bullets. The whole slope was covered with\r\ndead and wounded.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” interrupts one of the Fourteenth; “and they made that charge\r\nright gamely, too, I can tell you. They were good soldiers, and well\r\nled. When we went over the works, I remember seeing the body of a\r\nlittle Major of one of the regiments lying right on the top. If he\r\nhadn’t been killed he’d been inside in a half-a-dozen steps more.\r\nThere’s no mistake about it; those regulars will fight.”\r\n\r\n“When we saw this,” resumed the narrator, “it set our fellows fairly\r\nwild; they became just crying mad; I never saw them so before. The\r\norder came to strip for the charge, and our knapsacks were piled in\r\nhalf a minute. A Lieutenant of our company, who was then on the staff\r\nof Gen. Baird, our division commander, rode slowly down the line and\r\ngave us our instructions to load our guns, fix bayonets, and hold fire\r\nuntil we were on top of the Rebel works. Then Colonel Este sang out\r\nclear and steady as a bugle signal:\r\n\r\n“‘Brigade, forward! Guide center! MARCH!!’\r\n\r\n“And we started. Heavens, how they did let into us, as we came up\r\ninto range. They had ten pieces of artillery, and more men behind the\r\nbreastworks than we had in line, and the fire they poured on us was\r\nsimply withering. We walked across the hundreds of dead and dying of\r\nthe regular brigade, and at every step our own men fell down among\r\nthem. General Baud’s horse was shot down, and the General thrown far\r\nover his head, but he jumped up and ran alongside of us. Major Wilson,\r\nour regimental commander, fell mortally wounded; Lieutenant Kirk was\r\nkilled, and also Captain Stopfard, Adjutant General of the brigade.\r\nLieutenants Cobb and Mitchell dropped with wounds that proved fatal in\r\na few days. Captain Ugan lost an arm, one-third of the enlisted men\r\nfell, but we went straight ahead, the grape and the musketry becoming\r\nworse every step, until we gained the edge of the hill, where we were\r\nchecked a minute by the brush, which the Rebels had fixed up in the\r\nshape of abattis. Just then a terrible fire from a new direction,\r\nour left, swept down the whole length of our line. The Colonel of\r\nthe Seventeenth New York--as gallant a man as ever lived saw the new\r\ntrouble, took his regiment in on the run, and relieved us of this, but\r\nhe was himself mortally wounded. If our boys were half-crazy before,\r\nthey were frantic now, and as we got out of the entanglement of the\r\nbrush, we raised a fearful yell and ran at the works. We climbed the\r\nsides, fired right down into the defenders, and then began with the\r\nbayonet and sword. For a few minutes it was simply awful. On both sides\r\nmen acted like infuriated devils. They dashed each other’s brains out\r\nwith clubbed muskets; bayonets were driven into men’s bodies up to the\r\nmuzzle of the gun; officers ran their swords through their opponents,\r\nand revolvers, after being emptied into the faces of the Rebels, were\r\nthrown with desperate force into the ranks. In our regiment was a\r\nstout German butcher named Frank Fleck. He became so excited that he\r\nthrew down his sword, and rushed among the Rebels with his bare fists,\r\nknocking down a swath of them. He yelled to the first Rebel he met:\r\n\r\n“Py Gott, I’ve no patience mit you,’ and knocked him sprawling. He\r\ncaught hold of the commander of the Rebel Brigade, and snatched him\r\nback over the works by main strength. Wonderful to say, he escaped\r\nunhurt, but the boys will probably not soon let him hear the last of,\r\n\r\n“Py Gott, I’ve no patience mit you.’\r\n\r\n“The Tenth Kentucky, by the queerest luck in the world, was matched\r\nagainst the Rebel Ninth Kentucky. The commanders of the two regiments\r\nwere brothers-in-law, and the men relatives, friends, acquaintances and\r\nschoolmates. They hated each other accordingly, and the fight between\r\nthem was more bitter, if possible, than anywhere else on the line. The\r\nThirty-Eighth Ohio and Seventy-fourth Indiana put in some work that was\r\njust magnificent. We hadn’t time to look at it then, but the dead and\r\nwounded piled up after the fight told the story.\r\n\r\n“We gradually forced our way over the works, but the Rebels were game\r\nto the last, and we had to make them surrender almost one at a time.\r\nThe artillerymen tried to fire on us when we were so close we could lay\r\nour hands on the guns.\r\n\r\n“Finally nearly all in the works surrendered, and were disarmed and\r\nmarched back. Just then an aid came dashing up with the information\r\nthat we must turn the works, and get ready to receive Hardee, who was\r\nadvancing to retake the position. We snatched up some shovels lying\r\nnear, and began work. We had no time to remove the dead and dying\r\nRebels on the works, and the dirt we threw covered them up. It proved\r\na false alarm. Hardee had as much as he could do to save his own hide,\r\nand the affair ended about dark.\r\n\r\n“When we came to count up what we had gained, we found that we had\r\nactually taken more prisoners from behind breastworks than there\r\nwere in our brigade when we started the charge. We had made the only\r\nreally successful bayonet charge of the campaign. Every other time\r\nsince we left Chattanooga the party standing on the defensive had been\r\nsuccessful. Here we had taken strong double lines, with ten guns,\r\nseven battle flags, and over two thousand prisoners. We had lost\r\nterribly--not less than one-third of the brigade, and many of our best\r\nmen. Our regiment went into the battle with fifteen officers; nine of\r\nthese were killed or wounded, and seven of the nine lost either their\r\nlimbs or lives. The Thirty-Eighth Ohio, and the other regiments of the\r\nbrigade lost equally heavy. We thought Chickamauga awful, but Jonesboro\r\ndiscounted it.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know,” said another of the Fourteenth, “I heard our Surgeon\r\ntelling about how that Colonel Grower, of the Seventeenth New York, who\r\ncame in so splendidly on our left, died? They say he was a Wall Street\r\nbroker, before the war. He was hit shortly after he led his regiment\r\nin, and after the fight, was carried back to the hospital. While our\r\nSurgeon was going the rounds Colonel Grower called him, and said\r\nquietly, ‘When you get through with the men, come and see me, please.’\r\n\r\n“The Doctor would have attended to him then, but Grower wouldn’t let\r\nhim. After he got through he went back to Grower, examined his wound,\r\nand told him that he could only live a few hours. Grower received the\r\nnews tranquilly, had the Doctor write a letter to his wife, and gave\r\nhim his things to send her, and then grasping the Doctor’s hand, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“Doctor, I’ve just one more favor to ask; will you grant it?’\r\n\r\n“The Doctor said, ‘Certainly; what is it?’\r\n\r\n“You say I can’t live but a few hours?’\r\n\r\n“Yes; that is true.’\r\n\r\n“And that I will likely be in great pain!’\r\n\r\n“I am sorry to say so.’\r\n\r\n“Well, then, do give me morphia enough to put me to sleep, so that I\r\nwill wake up only in another world.’\r\n\r\n“The Doctor did so; Colonel Grower thanked him; wrung his hand, bade\r\nhim good-by, and went to sleep to wake no more.”\r\n\r\n“Do you believe in presentiments and superstitions?” said another of\r\nthe Fourteenth. There was Fisher Pray, Orderly Sergeant of Company I.\r\nHe came from Waterville, O., where his folks are now living. The day\r\nbefore we started out he had a presentiment that we were going into\r\na fight, and that he would be killed. He couldn’t shake it off. He\r\ntold the Lieutenant, and some of the boys about it, and they tried\r\nto ridicule him out of it, but it was no good. When the sharp firing\r\nbroke out in front some of the boys said, ‘Fisher, I do believe you\r\nare right,’ and he nodded his head mournfully. When we were piling\r\nknapsacks for the charge, the Lieutenant, who was a great friend of\r\nFisher’s, said:\r\n\r\n“Fisher, you stay here and guard the knapsacks.’\r\n\r\n“Fisher’s face blazed in an instant.\r\n\r\n“No, sir,’ said he; I never shirked a fight yet, and I won’t begin now.’\r\n\r\n“So he went into the fight, and was killed, as he knew he would be.\r\nNow, that’s what I call nerve.”\r\n\r\n“The same thing was true of Sergeant Arthur Tarbox, of Company A,” said\r\nthe narrator; “he had a presentiment, too; he knew he was going to be\r\nkilled, if he went in, and he was offered an honorable chance to stay\r\nout, but he would not take it, and went in and was killed.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we staid there the next day, buried our dead, took care of our\r\nwounded, and gathered up the plunder we had taken from the Johnnies.\r\nThe rest of the army went off, ‘hot blocks,’ after Hardee and the\r\nrest of Hood’s army, which it was hoped would be caught outside of\r\nentrenchments. But Hood had too much the start, and got into the works\r\nat Lovejoy, ahead of our fellows. The night before we heard several\r\nvery loud explosions up to the north. We guessed what that meant, and\r\nso did the Twentieth Corps, who were lying back at the Chattahoochee,\r\nand the next morning the General commanding--Slocum--sent out a\r\nreconnaissance. It was met by the Mayor of Atlanta, who said that the\r\nRebels had blown up their stores and retreated. The Twentieth Corps\r\nthen came in and took possession of the City, and the next day--the\r\n3d--Sherman came in, and issued an order declaring the campaign at an\r\nend, and that we would rest awhile and refit.\r\n\r\n“We laid around Atlanta a good while, and things quieted down so\r\nthat it seemed almost like peace, after the four months of continual\r\nfighting we had gone through. We had been under a strain so long that\r\nnow we boys went in the other direction, and became too careless, and\r\nthat’s how we got picked up. We went out about five miles one night\r\nafter a lot of nice smoked hams that a nigger told us were stored in\r\nan old cotton press, and which we knew would be enough sight better\r\neating for Company C, than the commissary pork we had lived on so long.\r\nWe found the cotton press, and the hams, just as the nigger told us,\r\nand we hitched up a team to take them into camp. As we hadn’t seen any\r\nJohnny signs anywhere, we set our guns down to help load the meat, and\r\njust as we all came stringing out to the wagon with as much meat as we\r\ncould carry, a company of Ferguson’s Cavalry popped out of the woods\r\nabout one hundred yards in front of us and were on top of us before we\r\ncould say I scat. You see they’d heard of the meat, too.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\n\r\nA FAIR SACRIFICE--THE STORY OF ONE BOY WHO WILLINGLY GAVE HIS YOUNG\r\nLIFE FOR HIS COUNTRY.\r\n\r\nCharley Barbour was one of the truest-hearted and best-liked of my\r\nschool-boy chums and friends. For several terms we sat together on\r\nthe same uncompromisingly uncomfortable bench, worried over the same\r\nboy-maddening problems in “Ray’s Arithmetic-Part III.,” learned the\r\nsame jargon of meaningless rules from “Greene’s Grammar,” pondered over\r\n“Mitchell’s Geography and Atlas,” and tried in vain to understand why\r\nProvidence made the surface of one State obtrusively pink and another\r\nultramarine blue; trod slowly and painfully over the rugged road\r\n“Bullion” points out for beginners in Latin, and began to believe we\r\nshould hate ourselves and everybody else, if we were gotten up after\r\nthe manner shown by “Cutter’s Physiology.” We were caught together in\r\nthe same long series of school-boy scrapes--and were usually ferruled\r\ntogether by the same strong-armed teacher. We shared nearly everything\r\n--our fun and work; enjoyment and annoyance--all were generally\r\nmeted out to us together. We read from the same books the story of\r\nthe wonderful world we were going to see in that bright future “when\r\nwe were men;” we spent our Saturdays and vacations in the miniature\r\nexplorations of the rocky hills and caves, and dark cedar woods around\r\nour homes, to gather ocular helps to a better comprehension of that\r\nmagical land which we were convinced began just beyond our horizon, and\r\nhad in it, visible to the eye of him who traveled through its enchanted\r\nbreadth, all that “Gulliver’s Fables,” the “Arabian Nights,” and a\r\nhundred books of travel and adventure told of.\r\n\r\nWe imagined that the only dull and commonplace spot on earth was that\r\nwhere we lived. Everywhere else life was a grand spectacular drama,\r\nfull of thrilling effects.\r\n\r\nBrave and handsome young men were rescuing distressed damsels,\r\nbeautiful as they were wealthy; bloody pirates and swarthy murderers\r\nwere being foiled by quaint spoken backwoodsmen, who carried unerring\r\nrifles; gallant but blundering Irishmen, speaking the most delightful\r\nbrogue, and making the funniest mistakes, were daily thwarting cool\r\nand determined villains; bold tars were encountering fearful sea\r\nperils; lionhearted adventurers were cowing and quelling whole tribes\r\nof barbarians; magicians were casting spells, misers hoarding gold,\r\nscientists making astonishing discoveries, poor and unknown boys\r\nachieving wealth and fame at a single bound, hidden mysteries coming\r\nto light, and so the world was going on, making reams of history with\r\neach diurnal revolution, and furnishing boundless material for the most\r\ndelightful books.\r\n\r\nAt the age of thirteen a perusal of the lives of Benjamin Franklin and\r\nHorace Greeley precipitated my determination to no longer hesitate in\r\nlaunching my small bark upon the great ocean. I ran away from home\r\nin a truly romantic way, and placed my foot on what I expected to be\r\nthe first round of the ladder of fame, by becoming “devil boy” in a\r\nprinting office in a distant large City. Charley’s attachment to his\r\nmother and his home was too strong to permit him to take this step,\r\nand we parted in sorrow, mitigated on my side by roseate dreams of the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nSix years passed. One hot August morning I met an old acquaintance\r\nat the Creek, in Andersonville. He told me to come there the next\r\nmorning, after roll-call, and he would take me to see some person who\r\nwas very anxious to meet me. I was prompt at the rendezvous, and was\r\nsoon joined by the other party. He threaded his way slowly for over\r\nhalf an hour through the closely-jumbled mass of tents and burrows,\r\nand at length stopped in front of a blanket-tent in the northwestern\r\ncorner. The occupant rose and took my hand. For an instant I was\r\npuzzled; then the clear, blue eyes, and well-remembered smile recalled\r\nto me my old-time comrade, Charley Barbour. His story was soon told.\r\nHe was a Sergeant in a Western Virginia cavalry regiment--the Fourth,\r\nI think. At the time Hunter was making his retreat from the Valley of\r\nVirginia, it was decided to mislead the enemy by sending out a courier\r\nwith false dispatches to be captured. There was a call for a volunteer\r\nfor this service. Charley was the first to offer, with that spirit of\r\ngenerous self-sacrifice that was one of his pleasantest traits when\r\na boy. He knew what he had to expect. Capture meant imprisonment at\r\nAndersonville; our men had now a pretty clear understanding of what\r\nthis was. Charley took the dispatches and rode into the enemy’s lines.\r\nHe was taken, and the false information produced the desired effect.\r\nOn his way to Andersonville he was stripped of all his clothing\r\nbut his shirt and pantaloons, and turned into the Stockade in this\r\ncondition. When I saw him he had been in a week or more. He told his\r\nstory quietly--almost diffidently--not seeming aware that he had done\r\nmore than his simple duty. I left him with the promise and expectation\r\nof returning the next day, but when I attempted to find him again, I\r\nwas lost in the maze of tents and burrows. I had forgotten to ask the\r\nnumber of his detachment, and after spending several days in hunting\r\nfor him, I was forced to give the search up. He knew as little of my\r\nwhereabouts, and though we were all the time within seventeen hundred\r\nfeet of each other, neither we nor our common acquaintance could ever\r\nmanage to meet again. This will give the reader an idea of the throng\r\ncompressed within the narrow limits of the Stockade. After leaving\r\nAndersonville, however, I met this man once more, and learned from him\r\nthat Charley had sickened and died within a month after his entrance to\r\nprison.\r\n\r\nSo ended his day-dream of a career in the busy world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\n\r\nWE LEAVE SAVANNAH--MORE HOPES OF EXCHANGE--SCENES AT DEPARTURE\r\n--“FLANKERS”--ON THE BACK TRACK TOWARD ANDERSONVILLE--ALARM THEREAT\r\n--AT THE PARTING OF TWO WAYS--WE FINALLY BRING UP AT CAMP LAWTON.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 11th of October there came an order for one\r\nthousand prisoners to fall in and march out, for transfer to some other\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nOf course, Andrews and I “flanked” into this crowd. That was our\r\nusual way of doing. Holding that the chances were strongly in favor\r\nof every movement of prisoners being to our lines, we never failed\r\nto be numbered in the first squad of prisoners that were sent out.\r\nThe seductive mirage of “exchange” was always luring us on. It must\r\ncome some time, certainly, and it would be most likely to come to\r\nthose who were most earnestly searching for it. At all events, we\r\nshould leave no means untried to avail ourselves of whatever seeming\r\nchances there might be. There could be no other motive for this move,\r\nwe argued, than exchange. The Confederacy was not likely to be at\r\nthe trouble and expense of hauling us about the country without some\r\ngood reason--something better than a wish to make us acquainted with\r\nSouthern scenery and topography. It would hardly take us away from\r\nSavannah so soon after bringing us there for any other purpose than\r\ndelivery to our people.\r\n\r\nThe Rebels encouraged this belief with direct assertions of its truth.\r\nThey framed a plausible lie about there having arisen some difficulty\r\nconcerning the admission of our vessels past the harbor defenses of\r\nSavannah, which made it necessary to take us elsewhere--probably to\r\nCharleston--for delivery to our men.\r\n\r\nWishes are always the most powerful allies of belief. There is\r\nlittle difficulty in convincing a man of that of which he wants to\r\nbe convinced. We forgot the lie told us when we were taken from\r\nAndersonville, and believed the one which was told us now.\r\n\r\nAndrews and I hastily snatched our worldly possessions--our overcoat,\r\nblanket, can, spoon, chessboard and men, yelled to some of our\r\nneighbors that they could have our hitherto much-treasured house, and\r\nrunning down to the gate, forced ourselves well up to the front of the\r\ncrowd that was being assembled to go out.\r\n\r\nThe usual scenes accompanying the departure of first squads were being\r\nacted tumultuously. Every one in the camp wanted to be one of the\r\nsupposed-to-be-favored few, and if not selected at first, tried to\r\n“flank in”--that is, slip into the place of some one else who had had\r\nbetter luck. This one naturally resisted displacement, ‘vi et armis,’\r\nand the fights would become so general as to cause a resemblance to the\r\nfamed Fair of Donnybrook. The cry would go up:\r\n\r\n“Look out for flankers!”\r\n\r\nThe lines of the selected would dress up compactly, and outsiders\r\ntrying to force themselves in would get mercilessly pounded.\r\n\r\nWe finally got out of the pen, and into the cars, which soon rolled\r\naway to the westward. We were packed in too densely to be able to lie\r\ndown. We could hardly sit down. Andrews and I took up our position in\r\none corner, piled our little treasures under us, and trying to lean\r\nagainst each other in such a way as to afford mutual support and rest,\r\ndozed fitfully through a long, weary night.\r\n\r\nWhen morning came we found ourselves running northwest through a poor,\r\npine-barren country that strongly resembled that we had traversed in\r\ncoming to Savannah. The more we looked at it the more familiar it\r\nbecame, and soon there was no doubt we were going back to Andersonville.\r\n\r\nBy noon we had reached Millen--eighty miles from Savannah, and\r\nfifty-three from Augusta. It was the junction of the road leading to\r\nMacon and that running to Augusta. We halted a little while at the “Y,”\r\nand to us the minutes were full of anxiety. If we turned off to the\r\nleft we were going back to Andersonville. If we took the right hand\r\nroad we were on the way to Charleston or Richmond, with the chances in\r\nfavor of exchange.\r\n\r\nAt length we started, and, to our joy, our engine took the right hand\r\ntrack. We stopped again, after a run of five miles, in the midst of one\r\nof the open, scattering forests of long leaved pine that I have before\r\ndescribed. We were ordered out of the cars, and marching a few rods,\r\ncame in sight of another of those hateful Stockades, which seemed to\r\nbe as natural products of the Sterile sand of that dreary land as its\r\ndesolate woods and its breed of boy murderers and gray-headed assassins.\r\n\r\nAgain our hearts sank, and death seemed more welcome than incarceration\r\nin those gloomy wooden walls. We marched despondently up to the gates\r\nof the Prison, and halted while a party of Rebel clerks made a list of\r\nour names, rank, companies, and regiments. As they were Rebels it was\r\nslow work. Reading and writing never came by nature, as Dogberry would\r\nsay, to any man fighting for Secession. As a rule, he took to them as\r\nreluctantly as if, he thought them cunning inventions of the Northern\r\nAbolitionist to perplex and demoralize him. What a half-dozen boys\r\ntaken out of our own ranks would have done with ease in an hour or so,\r\nthese Rebels worried over all of the afternoon, and then their register\r\nof us was so imperfect, badly written and misspelled, that the Yankee\r\nclerks afterwards detailed for the purpose, never could succeed in\r\nreducing it to intelligibility.\r\n\r\nWe learned that the place at which we had arrived was Camp Lawton, but\r\nwe almost always spoke of it as “Millen,” the same as Camp Sumter is\r\nuniversally known as Andersonville.\r\n\r\nShortly after dark we were turned inside the Stockade. Being the first\r\nthat had entered, there was quite a quantity of wood--the offal from\r\nthe timber used in constructing the Stockade--lying on the ground. The\r\nnight was chilly one we soon had a number of fires blazing. Green pitch\r\npine, when burned, gives off a peculiar, pungent odor, which is never\r\nforgotten by one who has once smelled it. I first became acquainted\r\nwith it on entering Andersonville, and to this day it is the most\r\npowerful remembrance I can have of the opening of that dreadful Iliad\r\nof woes. On my journey to Washington of late years the locomotives\r\nare invariably fed with pitch pine as we near the Capital, and as the\r\nwell-remembered smell reaches me, I grow sick at heart with the flood\r\nof saddening recollections indissolubly associated with it.\r\n\r\nAs our fires blazed up the clinging, penetrating fumes diffused\r\nthemselves everywhere. The night was as cool as the one when we arrived\r\nat Andersonville, the earth, meagerly sodded with sparse, hard,\r\nwiry grass, was the same; the same piney breezes blew in from the\r\nsurrounding trees, the same dismal owls hooted at us; the same mournful\r\nwhip-poor-will lamented, God knows what, in the gathering twilight.\r\nWhat we both felt in the gloomy recesses of downcast hearts Andrews\r\nexpressed as he turned to me with:\r\n\r\n“My God, Mc, this looks like Andersonville all over again.”\r\n\r\nA cupful of corn meal was issued to each of us. I hunted up some water.\r\nAndrews made a stiff dough, and spread it about half an inch thick on\r\nthe back of our chessboard. He propped this up before the fire, and\r\nwhen the surface was neatly browned over, slipped it off the board\r\nand turned it over to brown the other side similarly. This done, we\r\ndivided it carefully between us, swallowed it in silence, spread our\r\nold overcoat on the ground, tucked chess-board, can, and spoon under\r\nfar enough to be out of the reach of thieves, adjusted the thin blanket\r\nso as to get the most possible warmth out of it, crawled in close\r\ntogether, and went to sleep. This, thank Heaven, we could do; we could\r\nstill sleep, and Nature had some opportunity to repair the waste of the\r\nday. We slept, and forgot where we were.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX.\r\n\r\nOUR NEW QUARTERS AT CAMP LAWTON--BUILDING A HUT--AN EXCEPTIONAL\r\nCOMMANDANT--HE IS a GOOD MAN, BUT WILL TAKE BRIBES--RATIONS.\r\n\r\nIn the morning we took a survey of our new quarters, and found that\r\nwe were in a Stockade resembling very much in construction and\r\ndimensions that at Andersonville. The principal difference was that\r\nthe upright logs were in their rough state, whereas they were hewed at\r\nAndersonville, and the brook running through the camp was not bordered\r\nby a swamp, but had clean, firm banks.\r\n\r\nOur next move was to make the best of the situation. We were divided\r\ninto hundreds, each commanded by a Sergeant. Ten hundreds constituted\r\na division, the head of which was also a Sergeant. I was elected by my\r\ncomrades to the Sergeantcy of the Second Hundred of the First Division.\r\nAs soon as we were assigned to our ground, we began constructing\r\nshelter. For the first and only time in my prison experience, we found\r\na full supply of material for this purpose, and the use we made of it\r\nshowed how infinitely better we would have fared if in each prison the\r\nRebels had done even so slight a thing as to bring in a few logs from\r\nthe surrounding woods and distribute them to us. A hundred or so of\r\nthese would probably have saved thousands of lives at Andersonville and\r\nFlorence.\r\n\r\nA large tree lay on the ground assigned to our hundred. Andrews and I\r\ntook possession of one side of the ten feet nearest the butt. Other\r\nboys occupied the rest in a similar manner. One of our boys had\r\nsucceeded in smuggling an ax in with him, and we kept it in constant\r\nuse day and night, each group borrowing it for an hour or so at a time.\r\nIt was as dull as a hoe, and we were very weak, so that it was slow\r\nwork “niggering off”--(as the boys termed it) a cut of the log. It\r\nseemed as if beavers could have gnawed it off easier and more quickly.\r\nWe only cut an inch or so at a time, and then passed the ax to the next\r\nusers. Making little wedges with a dull knife, we drove them into the\r\nlog with clubs, and split off long, thin strips, like the weatherboards\r\nof a house, and by the time we had split off our share of the log in\r\nthis slow and laborious way, we had a fine lot of these strips. We were\r\nlucky enough to find four forked sticks, of which we made the corners\r\nof our dwelling, and roofed it carefully with our strips, held in place\r\nby sods torn up from the edge of the creek bank. The sides and ends\r\nwere enclosed; we gathered enough pine tops to cover the ground to a\r\ndepth of several inches; we banked up the outside, and ditched around\r\nit, and then had the most comfortable abode we had during our prison\r\ncareer. It was truly a house builded with our own hands, for we had no\r\ntools whatever save the occasional use of the aforementioned dull axe\r\nand equally dull knife.\r\n\r\nThe rude little hut represented as much actual hard, manual labor as\r\nwould be required to build a comfortable little cottage in the North,\r\nbut we gladly performed it, as we would have done any other work to\r\nbetter our condition.\r\n\r\nFor a while wood was quite plentiful, and we had the luxury daily of\r\nwarm fires, which the increasing coolness of the weather made important\r\naccessories to our comfort.\r\n\r\nOther prisoners kept coming in. Those we left behind at Savannah\r\nfollowed us, and the prison there was broken up. Quite a number also\r\ncame in from--Andersonville, so that in a little while we had between\r\nsix and seven thousand in the Stockade. The last comers found all the\r\nmaterial for tents and all the fuel used up, and consequently did not\r\nfare so well as the earlier arrivals.\r\n\r\nThe commandant of the prison--one Captain Bowes--was the best of his\r\nclass it was my fortune to meet. Compared with the senseless brutality\r\nof Wirz, the reckless deviltry of Davis, or the stupid malignance of\r\nBarrett, at Florence, his administration was mildness and wisdom itself.\r\n\r\nHe enforced discipline better than any of those named, but has what\r\nthey all lacked--executive ability--and he secured results that they\r\ncould not possibly attain, and without anything, like the friction that\r\nattended their efforts. I do not remember that any one was shot during\r\nour six weeks’ stay at Millen--a circumstance simply remarkable, since\r\nI do not recall a single week passed anywhere else without at least one\r\nmurder by the guards.\r\n\r\nOne instance will illustrate the difference of his administration\r\nfrom that of other prison commandants. He came upon the grounds\r\nof our division one morning, accompanied by a pleasant-faced,\r\nintelligent-appearing lad of about fifteen or sixteen. He said to us:\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen: (The only instance during our imprisonment when we received\r\nso polite a designation.) This is my son, who will hereafter call your\r\nroll. He will treat you as gentlemen, and I know you will do the same\r\nto him.”\r\n\r\nThis understanding was observed to the letter on both sides. Young\r\nBowes invariably spoke civilly to us, and we obeyed his orders with a\r\nprompt cheerfulness that left him nothing to complain of.\r\n\r\nThe only charge I have to make against Bowes is made more in detail in\r\nanother chapter, and that is, that he took money from well prisoners\r\nfor giving them the first chance to go through on the Sick Exchange.\r\nHow culpable this was I must leave each reader to decide for himself.\r\nI thought it very wrong at the time, but possibly my views might have\r\nbeen colored highly by my not having any money wherewith to procure my\r\nown inclusion in the happy lot of the exchanged.\r\n\r\nOf one thing I am certain: that his acceptance of money to bias his\r\nofficial action was not singular on his part. I am convinced that every\r\ncommandant we had over us--except Wirz--was habitually in the receipt\r\nof bribes from prisoners. I never heard that any one succeeded in\r\nbribing Wirz, and this is the sole good thing I can say of that fellow.\r\nAgainst this it may be said, however, that he plundered the boys so\r\neffectually on entering the prison as to leave them little of the\r\nwherewithal to bribe anybody.\r\n\r\nDavis was probably the most unscrupulous bribe-taker of the lot. He\r\nactually received money for permitting prisoners to escape to our\r\nlines, and got down to as low a figure as one hundred dollars for this\r\nsort of service. I never heard that any of the other commandants went\r\nthis far.\r\n\r\nThe rations issued to us were somewhat better than those of\r\nAndersonville, as the meal was finer and better, though it was\r\nabsurdedly insufficient in quantity, and we received no salt. On\r\nseveral occasions fresh beef was dealt out to us, and each time the\r\nexcitement created among those who had not tasted fresh meat for weeks\r\nand months was wonderful. On the first occasion the meat was simply the\r\nheads of the cattle killed for the use of the guards. Several wagon\r\nloads of these were brought in and distributed. We broke them up so\r\nthat every man got a piece of the bone, which was boiled and reboiled,\r\nas long as a single bubble of grease would rise to the surface of the\r\nwater; every vestige of meat was gnawed and scraped from the surface\r\nand then the bone was charred until it crumbled, when it was eaten.\r\nNo one who has not experienced it can imagine the inordinate hunger\r\nfor animal food of those who had eaten little else than corn bread\r\nfor so long. Our exhausted bodies were perishing for lack of proper\r\nsustenance. Nature indicated fresh beef as the best medium to repair\r\nthe great damage already done, and our longing for it became beyond\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX.\r\n\r\nTHE RAIDERS REAPPEAR ON THE SCENE--THE ATTEMPT TO ASSASSINATE THOSE WHO\r\nWERE CONCERNED IN THE EXECUTION--A COUPLE OF LIVELY FIGHTS, IN WHICH\r\nTHE RAIDERS ARE DEFEATED--HOLDING AN ELECTION.\r\n\r\nOur old antagonists--the Raiders--were present in strong force\r\nin Millen. Like ourselves, they had imagined the departure from\r\nAndersonville was for exchange, and their relations to the Rebels were\r\nsuch that they were all given a chance to go with the first squads. A\r\nnumber had been allowed to go with the sailors on the Special Naval\r\nExchange from Savannah, in the place of sailors and marines who had\r\ndied. On the way to Charleston a fight had taken place between them\r\nand the real sailors, during which one of their number--a curly-headed\r\nIrishman named Dailey, who was in such high favor with the Rebels that\r\nhe was given the place of driving the ration wagon that came in the\r\nNorth Side at Andersonville --was killed, and thrown under the wheels\r\nof the moving train, which passed over him.\r\n\r\nAfter things began to settle into shape at Millen, they seemed\r\nto believe that they were in such ascendancy as to numbers and\r\norganization that they could put into execution their schemes of\r\nvengeance against those of us who had been active participants in the\r\nexecution of their confederates at Andersonville.\r\n\r\nAfter some little preliminaries they settled upon Corporal “Wat” Payne,\r\nof my company, as their first victim. The reader will remember Payne as\r\none of the two Corporals who pulled the trigger to the scaffold at the\r\ntime of the execution.\r\n\r\nPayne was a very good man physically, and was yet in fair condition.\r\nThe Raiders came up one day with their best man--Pete Donnelly--and\r\nprovoked a fight, intending, in the course of it, to kill Payne. We,\r\nwho knew Payee, felt reasonably confident of his ability to handle\r\neven so redoubtable a pugilist as Donnelly, and we gathered together a\r\nlittle squad of our friends to see fair play.\r\n\r\nThe fight began after the usual amount of bad talk on both sides, and\r\nwe were pleased to see our man slowly get the better of the New York\r\nplug-ugly. After several sharp rounds they closed, and still Payne was\r\nahead, but in an evil moment he spied a pine knot at his feet, which he\r\nthought he could reach, and end the fight by cracking Donnelly’s head\r\nwith it. Donnelly took instant advantage of the movement to get it,\r\nthrew Payne heavily, and fell upon him. His crowd rushed in to finish\r\nour man by clubbing him over the head. We sailed in to prevent this,\r\nand after a rattling exchange of blows all around, succeeded in getting\r\nPayne away.\r\n\r\nThe issue of the fight seemed rather against us, however, and the\r\nRaiders were much emboldened. Payne kept close to his crowd after\r\nthat, and as we had shown such an entire willingness to stand by him,\r\nthe Raiders --with their accustomed prudence when real fighting was\r\ninvolved--did not attempt to molest him farther, though they talked\r\nvery savagely.\r\n\r\nA few days after this Sergeant Goody and Corporal Ned Carrigan, both of\r\nour battalion, came in. I must ask the reader to again recall the fact\r\nthat Sergeant Goody was one of the six hangmen who put the meal-sacks\r\nover the heads, and the ropes around the necks of the condemned.\r\nCorporal Carrigan was the gigantic prize fighter, who was universally\r\nacknowledged to be the best man physically among the whole thirty-four\r\nthousand in Andersonville. The Raiders knew that Goody had come in\r\nbefore we of his own battalion did. They resolved to kill him then and\r\nthere, and in broad daylight. He had secured in some way a shelter\r\ntent, and was inside of it fixing it up. The Raider crowd, headed by\r\nPete Donnelly, and Dick Allen, went up to his tent and one of them\r\ncalled to him:\r\n\r\n“Sergeant, come out; I want to see you.”\r\n\r\nGoody, supposing it was one of us, came crawling out on his hands and\r\nknees. As he did so their heavy clubs crashed down upon his head.\r\nHe was neither killed nor stunned, as they had reason to expect. He\r\nsucceeded in rising to his feet, and breaking through the crowd of\r\nassassins. He dashed down the side of the hill, hotly pursued by them.\r\nComing to the Creek, he leaped it in his excitement, but his pursuers\r\ncould not, and were checked. One of our battalion boys, who saw and\r\ncomprehended the whole affair, ran over to us, shouting:\r\n\r\n“Turn out! turn out, for God’s sake! the Raiders are killing Goody!”\r\n\r\nWe snatched up our clubs and started after the Raiders, but before we\r\ncould reach them, Ned Carrigan, who also comprehended what the trouble\r\nwas, had run to the side of Goody, armed with a terrible looking\r\nclub. The sight of Ned, and the demonstration that he was thoroughly\r\naroused, was enough for the Raider crew, and they abandoned the field\r\nhastily. We did not feel ourselves strong enough to follow them on to\r\ntheir own dung hill, and try conclusions with them, but we determined\r\nto report the matter to the Rebel Commandant, from whom we had reason\r\nto believe we could expect assistance. We were right. He sent in a\r\nsquad of guards, arrested Dick Allen, Pete Donnelly, and several other\r\nringleaders, took them out and put them in the stocks in such a manner\r\nthat they were compelled to lie upon their stomachs. A shallow tin\r\nvessel containing water was placed under their faces to furnish them\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\nThey staid there a day and night, and when released, joined the Rebel\r\nArmy, entering the artillery company that manned the guns in the fort\r\ncovering the prison. I used to imagine with what zeal they would send\r\nus over; a round of shell or grape if they could get anything like an\r\nexcuse.\r\n\r\nThis gave us good riddance--of our dangerous enemies, and we had little\r\nfurther trouble with any of them.\r\n\r\nThe depression in the temperature made me very sensible of the\r\ndeficiencies in my wardrobe. Unshod feet, a shirt like a fishing net,\r\nand pantaloons as well ventilated as a paling fence might do very well\r\nfor the broiling sun at Andersonville and Savannah, but now, with\r\nthe thermometer nightly dipping a little nearer the frost line, it\r\nbecame unpleasantly evident that as garments their office was purely\r\nperfunctory; one might say ornamental simply, if he wanted to be very\r\nsarcastic. They were worn solely to afford convenient quarters for\r\nmultitudes of lice, and in deference to the prejudice which has existed\r\nsince the Fall of Man against our mingling with our fellow creatures in\r\nthe attire provided us by Nature. Had I read Darwin then I should have\r\nexpected that my long exposure to the weather would start a fine suit\r\nof fur, in the effort of Nature to adapt, me to my environment. But no\r\nmore indications of this appeared than if I had been a hairless dog of\r\nMexico, suddenly transplanted to more northern latitudes. Providence\r\ndid not seem to be in the tempering-the-wind-to-the-shorn-lamb\r\nbusiness, as far as I was concerned. I still retained an almost\r\nunconquerable prejudice against stripping the dead to secure clothes,\r\nand so unless exchange or death came speedily, I was in a bad fix.\r\n\r\nOne morning about day break, Andrews, who had started to go to another\r\npart of the camp, came slipping back in a state of gleeful excitement.\r\nAt first I thought he either had found a tunnel or had heard some good\r\nnews about exchange. It was neither. He opened his jacket and handed\r\nme an infantry man’s blouse, which he had found in the main street,\r\nwhere it had dropped out of some fellow’s bundle. We did not make any\r\nextra exertion to find the owner. Andrews was in sore need of clothes\r\nhimself, but my necessities were so much greater that the generous\r\nfellow thought of my wants first. We examined the garment with as much\r\ninterest as ever a belle bestowed on a new dress from Worth’s. It was\r\nin fair preservation, but the owner had cut the buttons off to trade to\r\nthe guard, doubtless for a few sticks of wood, or a spoonful of salt.\r\nWe supplied the place of these with little wooden pins, and I donned\r\nthe garment as a shirt and coat and vest, too, for that matter. The\r\nbest suit I ever put on never gave me a hundredth part the satisfaction\r\nthat this did. Shortly after, I managed to subdue my aversion so far as\r\nto take a good shoe which a one-legged dead man had no farther use for,\r\nand a little later a comrade gave me for the other foot a boot bottom\r\nfrom which he had cut the top to make a bucket.\r\n\r\n                    ...........................\r\n\r\nThe day of the Presidential election of 1864 approached. The Rebels\r\nwere naturally very much interested in the result, as they believed\r\nthat the election of McClellan meant compromise and cessation of\r\nhostilities, while the re-election of Lincoln meant prosecution of\r\nthe War to the bitter end. The toadying Raiders, who were perpetually\r\nhanging around the gate to get a chance to insinuate themselves into\r\nthe favor of the Rebel officers, persuaded them that we were all so\r\nbitterly hostile to our Government for not exchanging us that if we\r\nwere allowed to vote we would cast an overwhelming majority in favor of\r\nMcClellan.\r\n\r\nThe Rebels thought that this might perhaps be used to advantage as\r\npolitical capital for their friends in the North. They gave orders\r\nthat we might, if we chose, hold an election on the same day of the\r\nPresidential election. They sent in some ballot boxes, and we elected\r\nJudges of the Election.\r\n\r\nAbout noon of that day Captain Bowes, and a crowd of tightbooted,\r\nbroad-hatted Rebel officers, strutted in with the peculiar\r\n“Ef-yer-don’t-b’lieve--I’m-a-butcher-jest-smell-o’-mebutes” swagger\r\ncharacteristic of the class. They had come in to see us all voting for\r\nMcClellan. Instead, they found the polls surrounded with ticket pedlers\r\nshouting:\r\n\r\n“Walk right up here now, and get your\r\nUnconditional-Union-Abraham-Lincoln-tickets!”\r\n\r\n“Here’s your straight-haired prosecution-of-the-war ticket.”\r\n\r\n“Vote the Lincoln ticket; vote to whip the Rebels, and make peace with\r\nthem when they’ve laid down their arms.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t vote a McClellan ticket and gratify Rebels, everywhere,” etc.\r\n\r\nThe Rebel officers did not find the scene what their fancy painted it,\r\nand turning around they strutted out.\r\n\r\nWhen the votes came to be counted out there were over seven thousand\r\nfor Lincoln, and not half that many hundred for McClellan. The latter\r\ngot very few votes outside the Raider crowd. The same day a similar\r\nelection was held in Florence, with like result. Of course this did not\r\nindicate that there was any such a preponderance of Republicans among\r\nus. It meant simply that the Democratic boys, little as they might have\r\nliked Lincoln, would have voted for him a hundred times rather than do\r\nanything to please the Rebels.\r\n\r\nI never heard that the Rebels sent the result North.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI.\r\n\r\nTHE REBELS FORMALLY PROPOSE TO US TO DESERT TO THEM--CONTUMELIOUS\r\nTREATMENT OF THE PROPOSITION--THEIR RAGE--AN EXCITING TIME--AN OUTBREAK\r\nTHREATENED--DIFFICULTIES ATTENDING DESERTION TO THE REBELS.\r\n\r\nOne day in November, some little time after the occurrences narrated\r\nin the last chapter, orders came in to make out rolls of all those who\r\nwere born outside of the United States, and whose terms of service had\r\nexpired.\r\n\r\nWe held a little council among ourselves as to the meaning of this, and\r\nconcluded that some partial exchange had been agreed on, and the Rebels\r\nwere going to send back the class of boys whom they thought would be\r\nof least value to the Government. Acting on this conclusion the great\r\nmajority of us enrolled ourselves as foreigners, and as having served\r\nout our terms. I made out the roll of my hundred, and managed to give\r\nevery man a foreign nativity. Those whose names would bear it were\r\nassigned to England, Ireland, Scotland France and Germany, and the\r\nbalance were distributed through Canada and the West Indies. After\r\nfinishing the roll and sending it out, I did not wonder that the Rebels\r\nbelieved the battles for the Union were fought by foreign mercenaries.\r\nThe other rolls were made out in the same way, and I do not suppose\r\nthat they showed five hundred native Americans in the Stockade.\r\n\r\nThe next day after sending out the rolls, there came an order that all\r\nthose whose names appeared thereon should fall in. We did so, promptly,\r\nand as nearly every man in camp was included, we fell in as for other\r\npurposes, by hundreds and thousands. We were then marched outside,\r\nand massed around a stump on which stood a Rebel officer, evidently\r\nwaiting to make us a speech. We awaited his remarks with the greatest\r\nimpatience, but He did not begin until the last division had marched\r\nout and came to a parade rest close to the stump.\r\n\r\nIt was the same old story:\r\n\r\n“Prisoners, you can no longer have any doubt that your Government has\r\ncruelly abandoned you; it makes no efforts to release you, and refuses\r\nall our offers of exchange. We are anxious to get our men back, and\r\nhave made every effort to do so, but it refuses to meet us on any\r\nreasonable grounds. Your Secretary of War has said that the Government\r\ncan get along very well without you, and General Halleck has said that\r\nyou were nothing but a set of blackberry pickers and coffee boilers\r\nanyhow.\r\n\r\n“You’ve already endured much more than it could expect of you; you\r\nserved it faithfully during the term you enlisted for, and now, when it\r\nis through with you, it throws you aside to starve and die. You also\r\ncan have no doubt that the Southern Confederacy is certain to succeed\r\nin securing its independence. It will do this in a few months. It now\r\noffers you an opportunity to join its service, and if you serve it\r\nfaithfully to the end, you will receive the same rewards as the rest of\r\nits soldiers. You will be taken out of here, be well clothed and fed,\r\ngiven a good bounty, and, at the conclusion of the War receive a land\r\nwarrant for a nice farm. If you”--\r\n\r\nBut we had heard enough. The Sergeant of our division--a man with a\r\nstentorian voice sprang out and shouted:\r\n\r\n“Attention, first Division!”\r\n\r\nWe Sergeants of hundreds repeated the command down the line. Shouted he:\r\n\r\n“First Division, about--”\r\n\r\nSaid we:\r\n\r\n“First Hundred, about--”\r\n\r\n“Second Hundred, about--”\r\n\r\n“Third Hundred, about--”\r\n\r\n“Fourth Hundred, about--” etc., etc.\r\n\r\nSaid he:--\r\n\r\n“FACE!!”\r\n\r\nTen Sergeants repeated “Face!” one after the other, and each man in the\r\nhundreds turned on his heel. Then our leader commanded--\r\n\r\n“First Division, forward! MARCH!” and we strode back into the Stockade,\r\nfollowed immediately by all the other divisions, leaving the orator\r\nstill standing on the stump.\r\n\r\nThe Rebels were furious at this curt way of replying. We had scarcely\r\nreached our quarters when they came in with several companies, with\r\nloaded guns and fixed bayonets. They drove us out of our tents and\r\nhuts, into one corner, under the pretense of hunting axes and spades,\r\nbut in reality to steal our blankets, and whatever else they could find\r\nthat they wanted, and to break down and injure our huts, many of which,\r\ncosting us days of patient labor, they destroyed in pure wantonness.\r\n\r\nWe were burning with the bitterest indignation. A tall, slender man\r\nnamed Lloyd, a member of the Sixty-First Ohio--a rough, uneducated\r\nfellow, but brim full of patriotism and manly common sense, jumped\r\nup on a stump and poured out his soul in rude but fiery eloquence:\r\n“Comrades,” he said, “do not let the blowing of these Rebel whelps\r\ndiscourage you; pay no attention to the lies they have told you\r\nto-day; you know well that our Government is too honorable and just to\r\ndesert any one who serves it; it has not deserted us; their hell-born\r\nConfederacy is not going to succeed. I tell you that as sure as there\r\nis a God who reigns and judges in Israel, before the Spring breezes\r\nstir the tops of these blasted old pines their Confederacy and all the\r\nlousy graybacks who support it will be so deep in hell that nothing\r\nbut a search warrant from the throne of God Almighty can ever find it\r\nagain. And the glorious old Stars and Stripes--”\r\n\r\nHere we began cheering tremendously. A Rebel Captain came running up,\r\nsaid to the guard, who was leaning on his gun, gazing curiously at\r\nLloyd:\r\n\r\n“What in ---- are you standing gaping there for? Why don’t you shoot\r\nthe ---- ---- Yankee son---- --- -----?” and snatching the gun away\r\nfrom him, cocked and leveled it at Lloyd, but the boys near jerked the\r\nspeaker down from the stump and saved his life.\r\n\r\nWe became fearfully, wrought up. Some of the more excitable shouted\r\nout to charge on the line of guards, snatch they guns away from them,\r\nand force our way through the gate The shouts were taken up by others,\r\nand, as if in obedience to the suggestion, we instinctively formed in\r\nline-of-battle facing the guards. A glance down the line showed me an\r\narray of desperate, tensely drawn faces, such as one sees who looks a\r\nmen when they are summoning up all their resolution for some deed of\r\ngreat peril. The Rebel officers hastily retreated behind the line of\r\nguards, whose faces blanched, but they leveled the muskets and prepared\r\nto receive us.\r\n\r\nCaptain Bowes, who was overlooking the prison from an elevation\r\noutside, had, however, divined the trouble at the outset, an was\r\npreparing to meet it. The gunners, who had shotted the pieces and\r\ntrained them upon us when we came out to listen t the speech, had again\r\ncovered us with them, and were ready to sweep the prison with grape\r\nand canister at the instant of command. The long roll was summoning\r\nthe infantry regiments back into line, and some of the cooler-headed\r\namong us pointed these facts out and succeeded in getting the line to\r\ndissolve again into groups of muttering, sullen-faced men. When this\r\nwas done, the guards marched out, by a cautious indirect maneuver, so\r\nas not to turn their backs to us.\r\n\r\nIt was believed that we had some among us who would like to avail\r\nthemselves of the offer of the Rebels, and that they would try to\r\ninform the Rebels of their desires by going to the gate during\r\nthe night and speaking to the Officer-of-the-Guard. A squad armed\r\nthemselves with clubs and laid in wait for these. They succeeded in\r\ncatching several --snatching some of then back even after they had\r\ntold the guard their wishes in a tone so loud that all near could hear\r\ndistinctly. The Officer-of-the-Guard rushed in two or three times in a\r\nvain attempt to save the would be deserter from the cruel hands that\r\nclutched him and bore him away to where he had a lesson in loyalty\r\nimpressed upon the fleshiest part of his person by a long, flexible\r\nstrip of pine wielded by very willing hands.\r\n\r\nAfter this was kept up for several nights different ideas began I to\r\nprevail. It was felt that if a man wanted to join the Rebels, the\r\nbest way was to let him go and get rid of him. He was of no benefit\r\nto the Government, and would be of none to the Rebels. After this no\r\nrestriction was put upon any one who desired to go outside and take the\r\noath. But very few did so, however, and these were wholly confined to\r\nthe Raider crowd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII.\r\n\r\nSERGEANT LEROY L. KEY--HIS ADVENTURES SUBSEQUENT TO THE EXECUTIONS\r\n--HE GOES OUTSIDE AT ANDERSONVILLE ON PAROLE--LABORS IN THE COOK-HOUSE\r\n--ATTEMPTS TO ESCAPE--IS RECAPTURED AND TAKEN TO MACON--ESCAPES FROM\r\nTHERE, BUT IS COMPELLED TO RETURN--IS FINALLY EXCHANGED AT SAVANNAH.\r\n\r\nLeroy L. Key, the heroic Sergeant of Company M, Sixteenth Illinois\r\nCavalry, who organized and led the Regulators at Andersonville in their\r\nsuccessful conflict with and defeat of the Raiders, and who presided at\r\nthe execution of the six condemned men on the 11th of July, furnishes,\r\nat the request of the author, the following story of his prison career\r\nsubsequent to that event:\r\n\r\nOn the 12th day of July, 1864, the day after the hanging of the six\r\nRaiders, by the urgent request of my many friends (of whom you were\r\none), I sought and obtained from Wirz a parole for myself and the six\r\nbrave men who assisted as executioners of those desperados. It seemed\r\nthat you were all fearful that we might, after what had been done,\r\nbe assassinated if we remained in the Stockade; and that we might be\r\noverpowered, perhaps, by the friends of the Raiders we had hanged, at a\r\ntime possibly, when you would not be on hand to give us assistance, and\r\nthus lose our lives for rendering the help we did in getting rid of the\r\nworst pestilence we had to contend with.\r\n\r\nOn obtaining my parole I was very careful to have it so arranged and\r\nmutually understood, between Wirz and myself, that at any time that my\r\nsquad (meaning the survivors of my comrades, with whom I was originally\r\ncaptured) was sent away from Andersonville, either to be exchanged or\r\nto go to another prison, that I should be allowed to go with them.\r\nThis was agreed to, and so written in my parole which I carried until\r\nit absolutely wore out. I took a position in the cook-house, and the\r\nother boys either went to work there, or at the hospital or grave-yard\r\nas occasion required. I worked here, and did the best I could for the\r\nmany starving wretches inside, in the way of preparing their food,\r\nuntil the eighth day of September, at which time, if you remember,\r\nquite a train load of men were removed, as many of us thought, for the\r\npurpose of exchange; but, as we afterwards discovered, to be taken to\r\nanother prison. Among the crowd so removed was my squad, or, at least,\r\na portion of them, being my intimate mess-mates while in the Stockade.\r\nAs soon as I found this to be the case I waited on Wirz at his office,\r\nand asked permission to go with them, which he refused, stating that\r\nhe was compelled to have men at the cookhouse to cook for those in the\r\nStockade until they were all gone or exchanged. I reminded him of the\r\ncondition in my parole, but this only had the effect of making him\r\nmad, and he threatened me with the stocks if I did not go back and\r\nresume work. I then and there made up my mind to attempt my escape,\r\nconsidering that the parole had first been broken by the man that\r\ngranted it.\r\n\r\nOn inquiry after my return to the cook-house, I found four other boys\r\nwho were also planning an escape, and who were only too glad to get me\r\nto join them and take charge of the affair. Our plans were well laid\r\nand well executed, as the sequel will prove, and in this particular\r\nmy own experience in the endeavor to escape from Andersonville is not\r\nentirely dissimilar from yours, though it had different results. I very\r\nmuch regret that in the attempt I lost my penciled memorandum, in which\r\nit was my habit to chronicle what went on around me daily, and where I\r\nhad the names of my brave comrades who made the effort to escape with\r\nme. Unfortunately, I cannot now recall to memory the name of one of\r\nthem or remember to what commands they belonged.\r\n\r\nI knew that our greatest risk was run in eluding the guards, and that\r\nin the morning we should be compelled to cheat the blood-hounds. The\r\nfirst we managed to do very well, not without many hairbreadth escapes,\r\nhowever; but we did succeed in getting through both lines of guards,\r\nand found ourselves in the densest pine forest I ever saw. We traveled,\r\nas nearly as we could judge, due north all night until daylight. From\r\nour fatigue and bruises, and the long hours that had elapsed since 8\r\no’clock, the time of our starting, we thought we had come not less than\r\ntwelve or fifteen miles. Imagine our surprise and mortification, then,\r\nwhen we could plainly hear the reveille, and almost the Sergeant’s\r\nvoice calling the roll, while the answers of “Here!” were perfectly\r\ndistinct. We could not possibly have been more than a mile, or a\r\nmile-and-a-half at the farthest, from the Stockade.\r\n\r\nOur anxiety and mortification were doubled when at the usual hour--as\r\nwe supposed--we heard the well-known and long-familiar sound of the\r\nhunter’s horn, calling his hounds to their accustomed task of making\r\nthe circuit of the Stockade, for the purpose of ascertaining whether\r\nor not any “Yankee” had had the audacity to attempt an escape. The\r\nhounds, anticipating, no doubt, this usual daily work, gave forth glad\r\nbarks of joy at being thus called forth to duty. We heard them start,\r\nas was usual, from about the railroad depot (as we imagined), but the\r\nsounds growing fainter and fainter gave us a little hope that our trail\r\nhad been missed. Only a short time, however, were we allowed this\r\npleasant reflection, for ere long--it could not have been more than an\r\nhour--we could plainly see that they were drawing nearer and nearer.\r\nThey finally appeared so close that I advised the boys to climb a tree\r\nor sapling in order to keep the dogs from biting them, and to be ready\r\nto surrender when the hunters came up, hoping thus to experience as\r\nlittle misery as possible, and not dreaming but that we were caught.\r\nOn, on came the hounds, nearer and nearer still, till we imagined\r\nthat we could see the undergrowth in the forest shaking by coming in\r\ncontact with their bodies. Plainer and plainer came the sound of the\r\nhunter’s voice urging them forward. Our hearts were in our throats,\r\nand in the terrible excitement we wondered if it could be possible for\r\nProvidence to so arrange it that the dogs would pass us. This last\r\nthought, by some strange fancy, had taken possession of me, and I here\r\nfrankly acknowledge that I believed it would happen. Why I believed\r\nit, God only knows. My excitement was so great, indeed, that I almost\r\nlost sight of our danger, and felt like shouting to the dogs myself,\r\nwhile I came near losing my hold on the tree in which I was hidden. By\r\nchance I happened to look around at my nearest neighbor in distress.\r\nHis expression was sufficient to quell any enthusiasm I might have had,\r\nand I, too, became despondent. In a very few minutes our suspense was\r\nover. The dogs came within not less than three hundred yards of us,\r\nand we could even see one of them, God in Heaven can only imagine what\r\ngreat joy was then, brought to our aching hearts, for almost instantly\r\nupon coming into sight, the hounds struck off on a different trail, and\r\npassed us. Their voices became fainter and fainter, until finally we\r\ncould hear them no longer. About noon, however, they were called back\r\nand taken to camp, but until that time not one of us left our position\r\nin the trees.\r\n\r\nWhen we were satisfied that we were safe for the present, we descended\r\nto the ground to get what rest we could, in order to be prepared for\r\nthe night’s march, having previously agreed to travel at night and\r\nsleep in the day time. “Our Father, who art in Heaven,” etc., were the\r\nfirst words that escaped my lips, and the first thoughts that came\r\nto my mind as I landed on terra firma. Never before, or since, had I\r\nexperienced such a profound reverence for Almighty God, for I firmly\r\nbelieve that only through some mighty invisible power were we at that\r\ntime delivered from untold tortures. Had we been found, we might have\r\nbeen torn and mutilated by the dogs, or, taken back to Andersonville,\r\nhave suffered for days or perhaps weeks in the stocks or chain gang,\r\nas the humor of Wirz might have dictated at the time--either of which\r\nwould have been almost certain death.\r\n\r\nIt was very fortunate for us that before our escape from Andersonville\r\nwe were detailed at the cook-house, for by this means we were enabled\r\nto bring away enough food to live for several days without the\r\nnecessity of theft. Each one of us had our haversacks full of such\r\nsmall delicacies as it was possible for us to get when we started,\r\nthese consisting of corn bread and fat bacon--nothing less, nothing\r\nmore. Yet we managed to subsist comfortably until our fourth day out,\r\nwhen we happened to come upon a sweet potato patch, the potatos in\r\nwhich had not been dug. In a very short space of time we were all well\r\nsupplied with this article, and lived on them raw during that day and\r\nthe next night.\r\n\r\nJust at evening, in going through a field, we suddenly came across\r\nthree negro men, who at first sight of us showed signs of running,\r\nthinking, as they told us afterward, that we were the “patrols.” After\r\nexplaining to them who we were and our condition, they took us to a\r\nvery quiet retreat in the woods, and two of them went off, stating\r\nthat they would soon be back. In a very short time they returned laden\r\nwith well cooked provisions, which not only gave us a good supper, but\r\nsupplied us for the next day with all that we wanted. They then guided\r\nus on our way for several miles, and left us, after having refused\r\ncompensation for what they had done.\r\n\r\nWe continued to travel in this way for nine long weary nights, and on\r\nthe morning of the tenth day, as we were going into the woods to hide\r\nas usual, a little before daylight, we came to a small pond at which\r\nthere was a negro boy watering two mules before hitching them to a cane\r\nmill, it then being cane grinding time in Georgia. He saw us at the\r\nsame time we did him, and being frightened put whip to the animals and\r\nran off. We tried every way to stop him, but it was no use. He had the\r\nstart of us. We were very fearful of the consequences of this mishap,\r\nbut had no remedy, and being very tired, could do nothing else but go\r\ninto the woods, go to sleep and trust to luck.\r\n\r\nThe next thing I remembered was being punched in the ribs by my comrade\r\nnearest to me, and aroused with the remark, “We are gone up.” On\r\nopening my eyes, I saw four men, in citizens’ dress, each of whom had a\r\nshot gun ready for use. We were ordered to get up. The first question\r\nasked us was:\r\n\r\n“Who are you.”\r\n\r\nThis was spoken in so mild a tone as to lead me to believe that we\r\nmight possibly be in the hands of gentlemen, if not indeed in those of\r\nfriends. It was some time before any one answered. The boys, by their\r\nlooks and the expression of their countenances, seemed to appeal to\r\nme for a reply to get them out of their present dilemma, if possible.\r\nBefore I had time to collect my thoughts, we were startled by these\r\nwords, coming from the same man that had asked the original question:\r\n\r\n“You had better not hesitate, for we have an idea who you are, and\r\nshould it prove that we are correct, it will be the worse for you.”\r\n\r\n“‘Who do you think we are?’ I inquired.”\r\n\r\n“‘Horse thieves and moss-backs,’ was the reply.”\r\n\r\nI jumped at the conclusion instantly that in order to save our lives,\r\nwe had better at once own the truth. In a very few words I told them\r\nwho we were, where we were from, how long we had been on the road,\r\netc. At this they withdrew a short distance from us for consultation,\r\nleaving us for the time in terrible suspense as to what our fate might\r\nbe. Soon, how ever, they returned and informed us that they would\r\nbe compelled to take us to the County Jail, to await further orders\r\nfrom the Military Commander of the District. While they were talking\r\ntogether, I took a hasty inventory of what valuables we had on hand.\r\nI found in the crowd four silver watches, about three hundred dollars\r\nin Confederate money, and possibly, about one hundred dollars in\r\ngreenbacks. Before their return, I told the boys to be sure not to\r\nrefuse any request I should make. Said I:\r\n\r\n“‘Gentlemen, we have here four silver watches and several hundred\r\ndollars in Confederate money and greenbacks, all of which we now offer\r\nyou, if you will but allow us to proceed on our journey, we taking our\r\nown chances in the future.’”\r\n\r\nThis proposition, to my great surprise, was refused. I thought then\r\nthat possibly I had been a little indiscreet in exposing our valuables,\r\nbut in this I was mistaken, for we had, indeed, fallen into the hands\r\nof gentlemen, whose zeal for the Lost Cause was greater than that for\r\nobtaining worldly wealth, and who not only refused the bribe, but took\r\nus to a well-furnished and well-supplied farm house close by, gave us\r\nan excellent breakfast, allowing us to sit at the table in a beautiful\r\ndining-room, with a lady at the head, filled our haversacks with good,\r\nwholesome food, and allowed us to keep our property, with an admonition\r\nto be careful how we showed it again. We were then put into a wagon and\r\ntaken to Hamilton, a small town, the county seat of Hamilton County,\r\nGeorgia, and placed in jail, where we remained for two days and nights\r\n--fearing, always, that the jail would be burned over our heads, as we\r\nheard frequent threats of that nature, by the mob on the streets. But\r\nthe same kind Providence that had heretofore watched over us, seemed\r\nnot to have deserted us in this trouble.\r\n\r\nOne of the days we were confined at this place was Sunday, and some\r\nkind-hearted lady or ladies (I only wish I knew their names, as well\r\nas those of the gentlemen who had us first in charge, so that I could\r\nchronicle them with honor here) taking compassion upon our forlorn\r\ncondition, sent us a splendid dinner on a very large china platter.\r\nWhether it was done intentionally or not, we never learned, but it was\r\na fact, however, that there was not a knife, fork or spoon upon the\r\ndish, and no table to set it upon. It was placed on the floor, around\r\nwhich we soon gathered, and, with grateful hearts, we “got away” with\r\nit all, in an incredibly short space of time, while many men and boys\r\nlooked on, enjoying our ludicrous attitudes and manners.\r\n\r\nFrom here we were taken to Columbus, Ga., and again placed in jail,\r\nand in the charge of Confederate soldiers. We could easily see that we\r\nwere gradually getting into hot water again, and that, ere many days,\r\nwe would have to resume our old habits in prison. Our only hope now\r\nwas that we would not be returned to Andersonville, knowing well that\r\nif we got back into the clutches of Wirz our chances for life would be\r\nslim indeed. From Columbus we were sent by rail to Macon, where we were\r\nplaced in a prison somewhat similar to Andersonville, but of nothing\r\nlike its pretensions to security. I soon learned that it was only used\r\nas a kind of reception place for the prisoners who were captured in\r\nsmall squads, and when they numbered two or three hundred, they would\r\nbe shipped to Andersonville, or some other place of greater dimensions\r\nand strength. What became of the other boys who were with me, after\r\nwe got to Macon, I do not know, for I lost sight of them there. The\r\nvery next day after our arrival, there were shipped to Andersonville\r\nfrom this prison between two and three hundred men. I was called on\r\nto go with the crowd, but having had a sufficient experience of the\r\nhospitality of that hotel, I concluded to play “old soldier,” so I\r\nbecame too sick to travel. In this way I escaped being sent off four\r\ndifferent times.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, quite a large number of commissioned officers had been\r\nsent up from Charleston to be exchanged at Rough and Ready. With them\r\nwere about forty more than the cartel called for, and they were left\r\nat Macon for ten days or two weeks. Among these officers were several\r\nof my acquaintance, one being Lieut. Huntly of our regiment (I am not\r\nquite sure that I am right in the name of this officer, but I think I\r\nam), through whose influence I was allowed to go outside with them on\r\nparole. It was while enjoying this parole that I got more familiarly\r\nacquainted with Captain Hurtell, or Hurtrell, who was in command of the\r\nprison at Macon, and to his honor, I here assert, that he was the only\r\ngentleman and the only officer that had the least humane feeling in his\r\nbreast, who ever had charge of me while a prisoner of war after we were\r\ntaken out of the hands of our original captors at Jonesville, Va.\r\n\r\nIt now became very evident that the Rebels were moving the prisoners\r\nfrom Andersonville and elsewhere, so as to place them beyond the reach\r\nof Sherman and Stoneman. At my present place of confinement the fear\r\nof our recapture had also taken possession of the Rebel authorities,\r\nso the prisoners were sent off in much smaller squads than formerly,\r\nfrequently not more than ten or fifteen in a gang, whereas, before,\r\nthey never thought of dispatching less than two or three hundred\r\ntogether. I acknowledge that I began to get very uneasy, fearful that\r\nthe “old soldier” dodge would not be much longer successful, and I\r\nwould be forced back to my old haunts. It so happened, however, that I\r\nmanaged to make it serve me, by getting detailed in the prison hospital\r\nas nurse, so that I was enabled to play another “dodge” upon the Rebel\r\nofficers. At first, when the Sergeant would come around to find out who\r\nwere able to walk, with assistance, to the depot, I was shaking with\r\na chill, which, according to my representation, had not abated in the\r\nleast for several hours. My teeth were actually chattering at the time,\r\nfor I had learned how to make them do so. I was passed. The next day\r\nthe orders for removal were more stringent than had yet been issued,\r\nstating that all who could stand it to be removed on stretchers must\r\ngo. I concluded at once that I was gone, so as soon as I learned how\r\nmatters were, I got out from under my dirty blanket, stood up and found\r\nI was able to walk, to my great astonishment, of course. An officer\r\ncame early in the morning to muster us into ranks preparatory for\r\nremoval. I fell in with the rest. We were marched out and around to the\r\ngate of the prison.\r\n\r\nNow, it so happened that just as we neared the gate of the prison,\r\nthe prisoners were being marched from the Stockade. The officer in\r\ncharge of us--we numbering possibly about ten--undertook to place us\r\nat the head of the column coming out, but the guard in charge of that\r\nsquad refused to let him do so. We were then ordered to stand at one\r\nside with no guard over us but the officer who had brought us from the\r\nHospital.\r\n\r\nTaking this in at a glance, I concluded that now was my chance to make\r\nmy second attempt to escape. I stepped behind the gate office (a small\r\nframe building with only one room), which was not more than six feet\r\nfrom me, and as luck (or Providence) would have it, the negro man whose\r\nduty it was, as I knew, to wait on and take care of this office, and\r\nwho had taken quite a liking for me, was standing at the back door. I\r\nwinked at him and threw him my blanket and the cup, at the same time\r\ntelling him in a whisper to hide them away for me until he heard from\r\nme again. With a grin and a nod, he accepted the trust, and I started\r\ndown along the walls of the Stockade alone. In order to make this\r\nmore plain, and to show what a risk I was running at the time, I will\r\nstate that between the Stockade and a brick wall, fully as high as the\r\nStockade fence that was parallel with it, throughout its entire length\r\non that side, there was a space of not more than thirty feet. On the\r\noutside of this Stockade was a platform, built for the guards to walk\r\non, sufficiently clear the top to allow them to look inside with ease,\r\nand on this side, on the platform, were three guards. I had traveled\r\nabout fifty feet only, from the gate office, when I heard the command\r\nto “Halt!” I did so, of course.\r\n\r\n“Where are you going, you d---d Yank?” said the guard.\r\n\r\n“Going after my clothes, that are over there in the wash,” pointing to\r\na small cabin just beyond the Stockade, where I happened to know that\r\nthe officers had their washing done.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” said he; “you are one of the Yank’s that’s been on, parole,\r\nare you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, hurry up, or you will get left.”\r\n\r\nThe other guards heard this conversation and thinking it all right I\r\nwas allowed to pass without further trouble. I went to the cabin in\r\nquestion--for I saw the last guard on the line watching me, and boldly\r\nentered. I made a clear statement to the woman in charge of it about\r\nhow I had made my escape, and asked her to secrete me in the house\r\nuntil night. I was soon convinced, however, from what she told me,\r\nas well as from my own knowledge of how things were managed in the\r\nConfederacy, that it would not be right for me to stay there, for if\r\nthe house was searched and I found in it, it would be the worse for\r\nher. Therefore, not wishing to entail misery upon another, I begged her\r\nto give me something to eat, and going to the swamp near by, succeeded\r\nin getting well without detection.\r\n\r\nI lay there all day, and during the time had a very severe chill and\r\nafterwards a burning fever, so that when night came, knowing I could\r\nnot travel, I resolved to return to the cabin and spend the night, and\r\ngive myself up the next morning. There was no trouble in returning. I\r\nlearned that my fears of the morning had not been groundless, for the\r\nguards had actually searched the house for me. The woman told them\r\nthat I had got my clothes and left the house shortly after my entrance\r\n(which was the truth except the part about the clothes), I thanked\r\nher very kindly and begged to be allowed to stay in the cabin till\r\nmorning, when I would present myself at Captain H.’s office and suffer\r\nthe consequences. This she allowed me to do. I shall ever feel grateful\r\nto this woman for her protection. She was white and her given name was\r\n“Sallie,” but the other I have forgotten.\r\n\r\nAbout daylight I strolled over near the office and looked around there\r\nuntil I saw the Captain take his seat at his desk. I stepped into the\r\ndoor as soon as I saw that he was not occupied and saluted him “a la\r\nmilitaire.”\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” he asked; “you look like a Yank.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” said I, “I am called by that name since I was captured in\r\nthe Federal Army.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what are you doing here, and what is your name?”\r\n\r\nI told him.\r\n\r\n“Why didn’t you answer to your name when it was called at the gate\r\nyesterday, sir?”\r\n\r\n“I never heard anyone call my name. Where were you?”\r\n\r\n“I ran away down into the swamp.”\r\n\r\n“Were you re-captured and brought back?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir, I came back of my own accord.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by this evasion?”\r\n\r\n“I am not trying to evade, sir, or I might not have been here now. The\r\ntruth is, Captain, I have been in many prisons since my capture, and\r\nhave been treated very badly in all of them, until I came here.”\r\n\r\n“I then explained to him freely my escape from Andersonville, and my\r\nsubsequent re-capture, how it was that I had played ‘old soldier’ etc.”\r\n\r\n“Now,” said I, “Captain, as long as I am a prisoner of war, I wish to\r\nstay with you, or under your command. This is my reason for running\r\naway yesterday, when I felt confident that if I did not do so I would\r\nbe returned under Wirz’s command, and, if I had been so returned, I\r\nwould have killed myself rather than submit to the untold tortures\r\nwhich he would have put me to, for having the audacity to attempt an\r\nescape from him.”\r\n\r\nThe Captain’s attention was here called to some other matters in hand,\r\nand I was sent back into the Stockade with a command very pleasantly\r\ngiven, that I should stay there until ordered out, which I very\r\ngratefully promised to do, and did. This was the last chance I ever\r\nhad to talk to Captain Hurtrell, to my great sorrow, for I had really\r\nformed a liking for the man, notwithstanding the fact that he was a\r\nRebel, and a commander of prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe next day we all had to leave Macon. Whether we were able or not,\r\nthe order was imperative. Great was my joy when I learned that we were\r\non the way to Savannah and not to Andersonville. We traveled over the\r\nsame road, so well described in one of your articles on Andersonville,\r\nand arrived in Savannah sometime in the afternoon of the 21st day of\r\nNovember, 1864. Our squad was placed in some barracks and confined\r\nthere until the next day. I was sick at the time, so sick in fact,\r\nthat I could hardly hold my head up. Soon after, we were taken to the\r\nFlorida depot, as they told us, to be shipped to some prison in those\r\ndismal swamps. I came near fainting when this was told to us, for I was\r\nconfident that I could not survive another siege of prison life, if it\r\nwas anything to compare to-what I had already suffered. When we arrived\r\nat the depot, it was raining. The officer in charge of us wanted to\r\nknow what train to put us on, for there were two, if not three, trains\r\nwaiting orders to start. He was told to march us on to a certain flat\r\ncar, near by, but before giving the order he demanded a receipt for us,\r\nwhich the train officer refused. We were accordingly taken back to our\r\nquarters, which proved to be a most fortunate circumstance.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d day of November, to our great relief, we were called upon to\r\nsign a parole preparatory to being sent down the river on the flat-boat\r\nto our exchange ships, then lying in the harbor. When I say we, I mean\r\nthose of us that had recently come from Macon, and a few others, who\r\nhad also been fortunate in reaching Savannah in small squads. The other\r\npoor fellows, who had already been loaded on the trains, were taken\r\naway to Florida, and many of them never lived to return. On the 24th\r\nthose of us who had been paroled were taken on board our ships, and\r\nwere once more safely housed under that great, glorious and beautiful\r\nStar Spangled Banner. Long may she wave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIII.\r\n\r\nDREARY WEATHER--THE COLD RAINS DISTRESS ALL AND KILL HUNDREDS--EXCHANGE\r\nOF TEN THOUSAND SICK--CAPTAIN BOWES TURNS A PRETTY, BUT NOT VERY\r\nHONEST, PENNY.\r\n\r\nAs November wore away long-continued, chill, searching rains desolated\r\nour days and nights. The great, cold drops pelted down slowly,\r\ndismally, and incessantly. Each seemed to beat through our emaciated\r\nframes against the very marrow of our bones, and to be battering its\r\nway remorselessly into the citadel of life, like the cruel drops that\r\nfell from the basin of the inquisitors upon the firmly-fastened head of\r\ntheir victim, until his reason fled, and the death-agony cramped his\r\nheart to stillness.\r\n\r\nThe lagging, leaden hours were inexpressibly dreary. Compared with\r\nmany others, we were quite comfortable, as our hut protected us from\r\nthe actual beating of the rain upon our bodies; but we were much more\r\nmiserable than under the sweltering heat of Andersonville, as we lay\r\nalmost naked upon our bed of pine leaves, shivering in the raw, rasping\r\nair, and looked out over acres of wretches lying dumbly on the sodden\r\nsand, receiving the benumbing drench of the sullen skies without a\r\ngroan or a motion.\r\n\r\nIt was enough to kill healthy, vigorous men, active and resolute,\r\nwith bodies well-nourished and well clothed, and with minds vivacious\r\nand hopeful, to stand these day-and-night-long solid drenchings. No\r\none can imagine how fatal it was to boys whose vitality was sapped by\r\nlong months in Andersonville, by coarse, meager, changeless food, by\r\ngroveling on the bare earth, and by hopelessness as to any improvement\r\nof condition.\r\n\r\nFever, rheumatism, throat and lung diseases and despair now came\r\nto complete the work begun by scurvy, dysentery and gangrene, in\r\nAndersonville.\r\n\r\nHundreds, weary of the long struggle, and of hoping against hope, laid\r\nthemselves down and yielded to their fate. In the six weeks that we\r\nwere at Millen, one man in every ten died. The ghostly pines there sigh\r\nover the unnoted graves of seven hundred boys, for whom life’s morning\r\nclosed in the gloomiest shadows. As many as would form a splendid\r\nregiment--as many as constitute the first born of a populous City--more\r\nthan three times as many as were slain outright on our side in the\r\nbloody battle of Franklin, succumbed to this new hardship. The country\r\nfor which they died does not even have a record of their names. They\r\nwere simply blotted out of existence; they became as though they had\r\nnever been.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the month the Rebels yielded to the importunities\r\nof our Government so far as to agree to exchange ten thousand sick.\r\nThe Rebel Surgeons took praiseworthy care that our Government should\r\nprofit as little as possible by this, by sending every hopeless case,\r\nevery man whose lease of life was not likely to extend much beyond his\r\nreaching the parole boat. If he once reached our receiving officers it\r\nwas all that was necessary; he counted to them as much as if he had\r\nbeen a Goliath. A very large portion of those sent through died on the\r\nway to our lines, or within a few hours after their transports at being\r\nonce more under the old Stars and Stripes had moderated.\r\n\r\nThe sending of the sick through gave our commandant--Captain Bowes--a\r\nfine opportunity to fill his pockets, by conniving at the passage\r\nof well men. There was still considerable money in the hands of a\r\nfew prisoners. All this, and more, too, were they willing to give\r\nfor their lives. In the first batch that went away were two of the\r\nleading sutlers at Andersonville, who had accumulated perhaps one\r\nthousand dollars each by their shrewd and successful bartering. It was\r\ngenerally believed that they gave every cent to Bowes for the privilege\r\nof leaving. I know nothing of the truth of this, but I am reasonably\r\ncertain that they paid him very handsomely.\r\n\r\nSoon we heard that one hundred and fifty dollars each had been\r\nsufficient to buy some men out; then one hundred, seventy-five, fifty,\r\nthirty, twenty, ten, and at last five dollars. Whether the upright\r\nBowes drew the line at the latter figure, and refused to sell his honor\r\nfor less than the ruling rates of a street-walker’s virtue, I know not.\r\nIt was the lowest quotation that came to my knowledge, but he may have\r\ngone cheaper. I have always observed that when men or women begin to\r\ntraffic in themselves, their price falls as rapidly as that of a piece\r\nof tainted meat in hot weather. If one could buy them at the rate they\r\nwind up with, and sell them at their first price, there would be room\r\nfor an enormous profit.\r\n\r\nThe cheapest I ever knew a Rebel officer to be bought was some weeks\r\nafter this at Florence. The sick exchange was still going on. I have\r\nbefore spoken of the Rebel passion for bright gilt buttons. It used\r\nto be a proverbial comment upon the small treasons that were of daily\r\noccurrence on both sides, that you could buy the soul of a mean man\r\nin our crowd for a pint of corn meal, and the soul of a Rebel guard\r\nfor a half dozen brass buttons. A boy of the Fifth-fourth Ohio,\r\nwhose home was at or near Lima, O., wore a blue vest, with the gilt,\r\nbright-trimmed buttons of a staff officer. The Rebel Surgeon who was\r\nexamining the sick for exchange saw the buttons and admired them very\r\nmuch. The boy stepped back, borrowed a knife from a comrade, cut the\r\nbuttons off, and handed them to the Doctor.\r\n\r\n“All right, sir,” said he as his itching palm closed over the coveted\r\nornaments; “you can pass,” and pass he did to home and friends.\r\n\r\nCaptain Bowes’s merchandizing in the matter of exchange was as open as\r\nthe issuing of rations. His agent in conducting the bargaining was a\r\nRaider--a New York gambler and stool-pigeon--whom we called “Mattie.”\r\nHe dealt quite fairly, for several times when the exchange was\r\ninterrupted, Bowes sent the money back to those who had paid him, and\r\nreceived it again when the exchange was renewed.\r\n\r\nHad it been possible to buy our way out for five cents each Andrews and\r\nI would have had to stay back, since we had not had that much money for\r\nmonths, and all our friends were in an equally bad plight. Like almost\r\neverybody else we had spent the few dollars we happened to have on\r\nentering prison, in a week or so, and since then we had been entirely\r\npenniless.\r\n\r\nThere was no hope left for us but to try to pass the Surgeons as\r\ndesperately sick, and we expended our energies in simulating this\r\ncondition. Rheumatism was our forte, and I flatter myself we got up\r\ntwo cases that were apparently bad enough to serve as illustrations\r\nfor a patent medicine advertisement. But it would not do. Bad as we\r\nmade our condition appear, there were so many more who were infinitely\r\nworse, that we stood no show in the competitive examination. I doubt\r\nif we would have been given an average of “50” in a report. We had to\r\nstand back, and see about one quarter of our number march out and away\r\nhome. We could not complain at this--much as we wanted to go ourselves,\r\nsince there could be no question that these poor fellows deserved\r\nthe precedence. We did grumble savagely, however, at Captain Bowes’s\r\nvenality, in selling out chances to moneyed men, since these were\r\ninvariably those who were best prepared to withstand the hardships of\r\nimprisonment, as they were mostly new men, and all had good clothes and\r\nblankets. We did not blame the men, however, since it was not in human\r\nnature to resist an opportunity to get away--at any cost-from that\r\naccursed place. “All that a man hath he will give for his life,” and I\r\nthink that if I had owned the City of New York in fee simple, I would\r\nhave given it away willingly, rather than stand in prison another month.\r\n\r\nThe sutlers, to whom I have alluded above, had accumulated sufficient\r\nto supply themselves with all the necessaries and some of the comforts\r\nof life, during any probable term of imprisonment, and still have a\r\nsnug amount left, but they, would rather give it all up and return to\r\nservice with their regiments in the field, than take the chances of any\r\nlonger continuance in prison.\r\n\r\nI can only surmise how much Bowes realized out of the prisoners by his\r\nvenality, but I feel sure that it could not have been less than three\r\nthousand dollars, and I would not be astonished to learn that it was\r\nten thousand dollars in green.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIV.\r\n\r\nANOTHER REMOVAL--SHERMAN’S ADVANCE SCARES THE REBELS INTO RUNNING\r\nUS AWAY FROM MILLEN--WE ARE TAKEN TO SAVANNAH, AND THENCE DOWN THE\r\nATLANTIC & GULF ROAD TO BLACKSHEAR\r\n\r\nOne night, toward the last of November, there was a general alarm\r\naround the prison. A gun was fired from the Fort, the long-roll was\r\nbeaten in the various camps of the guards, and the regiments answered\r\nby getting under arms in haste, and forming near the prison gates.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this, which we did not learn until weeks later, was that\r\nSherman, who had cut loose from Atlanta and started on his famous March\r\nto the Sea, had taken such a course as rendered it probable that Millen\r\nwas one of his objective points. It was, therefore, necessary that we\r\nshould be hurried away with all possible speed. As we had had no news\r\nfrom Sherman since the end of the Atlanta campaign, and were ignorant\r\nof his having begun his great raid, we were at an utter loss to account\r\nfor the commotion among our keepers.\r\n\r\nAbout 3 o’clock in the morning the Rebel Sergeants, who called the\r\nroll, came in and ordered us to turn out immediately and get ready to\r\nmove.\r\n\r\nThe morning was one of the most cheerless I ever knew. A cold rain\r\npoured relentlessly down upon us half-naked, shivering wretches, as\r\nwe groped around in the darkness for our pitiful little belongings of\r\nrags and cooking utensils, and huddled together in groups, urged on\r\ncontinually by the curses and abuse of the Rebel officers sent in to\r\nget us ready to move.\r\n\r\nThough roused at 3 o’clock, the cars were not ready to receive us till\r\nnearly noon. In the meantime we stood in ranks--numb, trembling, and\r\nheart-sick. The guards around us crouched over fires, and shielded\r\nthemselves as best they could with blankets and bits of tent cloth. We\r\nhad nothing to build fires with, and were not allowed to approach those\r\nof the guards.\r\n\r\nAround us everywhere was the dull, cold, gray, hopeless desolation of\r\nthe approach of minter. The hard, wiry grass that thinly covered the\r\nonce and sand, the occasional stunted weeds, and the sparse foliage\r\nof the gnarled and dwarfish undergrowth, all were parched brown and\r\nsere by the fiery heat of the long Summer, and now rattled drearily\r\nunder the pitiless, cold rain, streaming from lowering clouds that\r\nseemed to have floated down to us from the cheerless summit of some\r\ngreat iceberg; the tall, naked pines moaned and shivered; dead, sapless\r\nleaves fell wearily to the sodden earth, like withered hopes drifting\r\ndown to deepen some Slough of Despond.\r\n\r\nScores of our crowd found this the culmination of their misery. They\r\nlaid down upon the ground and yielded to death as s welcome relief, and\r\nwe left them lying there unburied when we moved to the cars.\r\n\r\nAs we passed through the Rebel camp at dawn, on our way to the cars,\r\nAndrews and I noticed a nest of four large, bright, new tin pans--a\r\nrare thing in the Confederacy at that time. We managed to snatch them\r\nwithout the guard’s attention being attracted, and in an instant had\r\nthem wrapped up in our blanket. But the blanket was full of holes, and\r\nin spite of all our efforts, it would slip at the most inconvenient\r\ntimes, so as to show a broad glare of the bright metal, just when it\r\nseemed it could not help attracting the attention of the guards or\r\ntheir officers. A dozen times at least we were on the imminent brink of\r\ndetection, but we finally got our treasures safely to the cars, and sat\r\ndown upon them.\r\n\r\nThe cars were open flats. The rain still beat down unrelentingly.\r\nAndrews and I huddled ourselves together so as to make our bodies\r\nafford as much heat as possible, pulled our faithful old overcoat\r\naround us as far as it would go, and endured the inclemency as best we\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nOur train headed back to Savannah, and again our hearts warmed up with\r\nhopes of exchange. It seemed as if there could be no other purpose of\r\ntaking us out of a prison so recently established and at such cost as\r\nMillen.\r\n\r\nAs we approached the coast the rain ceased, but a piercing cold wind\r\nset in, that threatened to convert our soaked rags into icicles.\r\n\r\nVery many died on the way. When we arrived at Savannah almost, if\r\nnot quite, every car had upon it one whom hunger no longer gnawed\r\nor disease wasted; whom cold had pinched for the last time, and for\r\nwhom the golden portals of the Beyond had opened for an exchange that\r\nneither Davis nor his despicable tool, Winder, could control.\r\n\r\nWe did not sentimentalize over these. We could not mourn; the thousands\r\nthat we had seen pass away made that emotion hackneyed and wearisome;\r\nwith the death of some friend and comrade as regularly an event of each\r\nday as roll call and drawing rations, the sentiment of grief had become\r\nnearly obsolete. We were not hardened; we had simply come to look upon\r\ndeath as commonplace and ordinary. To have had no one dead or dying\r\naround us would have been regarded as singular.\r\n\r\nBesides, why should we feel any regret at the passing away of those\r\nwhose condition would probably be bettered thereby! It was difficult\r\nto see where we who still lived were any better off than they who were\r\ngone before and now “forever at peace, each in his windowless palace\r\nof rest.” If imprisonment was to continue only another month, we would\r\nrather be with them.\r\n\r\nArriving at Savannah, we were ordered off the cars. A squad from each\r\ncar carried the dead to a designated spot, and land them in a row,\r\ncomposing their limbs as well as possible, but giving no other funeral\r\nrites, not even making a record of their names and regiments. Negro\r\nlaborers came along afterwards, with carts, took the bodies to some\r\nvacant ground, and sunk them out of sight in the sand.\r\n\r\nWe were given a few crackers each--the same rude imitation of “hard\r\ntack” that had been served out to us when we arrived at Savannah\r\nthe first time, and then were marched over and put upon a train on\r\nthe Atlantic & Gulf Railroad, running from Savannah along the sea\r\ncoast towards Florida. What this meant we had little conception, but\r\nhope, which sprang eternal in the prisoner’s breast, whispered that\r\nperhaps it was exchange; that there was some difficulty about our\r\nvessels coming to Savannah, and we were being taken to some other more\r\nconvenient sea port; probably to Florida, to deliver us to our folks\r\nthere. We satisfied ourselves that we were running along the sea coast\r\nby tasting the water in the streams we crossed, whenever we could get\r\nan opportunity to dip up some. As long as the water tasted salty we\r\nknew we were near the sea, and hope burned brightly.\r\n\r\nThe truth was--as we afterwards learned--the Rebels were terribly\r\npuzzled what to do with us. We were brought to Savannah, but that did\r\nnot solve the problem; and we were sent down the Atlantic & Gulf road\r\nas a temporary expedient.\r\n\r\nThe railroad was the worst of the many bad ones which it was my\r\nfortune to ride upon in my excursions while a guest of the Southern\r\nConfederacy. It had run down until it had nearly reached the worn-out\r\ncondition of that Western road, of which an employee of a rival route\r\nonce said, “that all there was left of it now was two streaks of rust\r\nand the right of way.” As it was one of the non-essential roads to the\r\nSouthern Confederacy, it was stripped of the best of its rolling-stock\r\nand machinery to supply the other more important lines.\r\n\r\nI have before mentioned the scarcity of grease in the South, and the\r\ndifficulty of supplying the railroads with lubricants. Apparently there\r\nhad been no oil on the Atlantic & Gulf since the beginning of the war,\r\nand the screeches of the dry axles revolving in the worn-out boxes were\r\nagonizing. Some thing would break on the cars or blow out on the engine\r\nevery few miles, necessitating a long stop for repairs. Then there was\r\nno supply of fuel along the line. When the engine ran out of wood it\r\nwould halt, and a couple of negros riding on the tender would assail\r\na panel of fence or a fallen tree with their axes, and after an hour\r\nor such matter of hard chopping, would pile sufficient wood upon the\r\ntender to enable us to renew our journey.\r\n\r\nFrequently the engine stopped as if from sheer fatigue or inanition.\r\nThe Rebel officers tried to get us to assist it up the grade by\r\ndismounting and pushing behind. We respectfully, but firmly, declined.\r\nWe were gentlemen of leisure, we said, and decidedly averse to manual\r\nlabor; we had been invited on this excursion by Mr. Jeff. Davis and his\r\nfriends, who set themselves up as our entertainers, and it would be a\r\ngross breach of hospitality to reflect upon our hosts by working our\r\npassage. If this was insisted upon, we should certainly not visit them\r\nagain. Besides, it made no difference to us whether the train got along\r\nor not. We were not losing anything by the delay; we were not anxious\r\nto go anywhere. One part of the Southern Confederacy was just as good\r\nas another to us. So not a finger could they persuade any of us to\r\nraise to help along the journey.\r\n\r\nThe country we were traversing was sterile and poor--worse even than\r\nthat in the neighborhood of Andersonville. Farms and farmhouses were\r\nscarce, and of towns there were none. Not even a collection of houses\r\nbig enough to justify a blacksmith shop or a store appeared along the\r\nwhole route. But few fields of any kind were seen, and nowhere was\r\nthere a farm which gave evidence of a determined effort on the part of\r\nits occupants to till the soil and to improve their condition.\r\n\r\nWhen the train stopped for wood, or for repairs, or from exhaustion,\r\nwe were allowed to descend from the cars and stretch our numbed limbs.\r\nIt did us good in other ways, too. It seemed almost happiness to be\r\noutside of those cursed Stockades, to rest our eyes by looking away\r\nthrough the woods, and seeing birds and animals that were free. They\r\nmust be happy, because to us to be free once more was the summit of\r\nearthly happiness.\r\n\r\nThere was a chance, too, to pick up something green to eat, and we\r\nwere famishing for this. The scurvy still lingered in our systems,\r\nand we were hungry for an antidote. A plant grew rather plentifully\r\nalong the track that looked very much as I imagine a palm leaf fan\r\ndoes in its green state. The leaf was not so large as an ordinary palm\r\nleaf fan, and came directly out of the ground. The natives called\r\nit “bull-grass,” but anything more unlike grass I never saw, so we\r\nrejected that nomenclature, and dubbed them “green fans.” They were\r\nvery hard to pull up, it being usually as much as the strongest of us\r\ncould do to draw them out of the ground. When pulled up there was found\r\nthe smallest bit of a stock--not as much as a joint of one’s little\r\nfinger--that was eatable. It had no particular taste, and probably\r\nlittle nutriment, still it was fresh and green, and we strained our\r\nweak muscles and enfeebled sinews at every opportunity, endeavoring to\r\npull up a “green fan.”\r\n\r\nAt one place where we stopped there was a makeshift of a garden, one of\r\nthose sorry “truck patches,” which do poor duty about Southern cabins\r\nfor the kitchen gardens of the Northern, farmers, and produce a few\r\ncoarse cow peas, a scanty lot of collards (a coarse kind of cabbage,\r\nwith a stalk about a yard long) and some onions to vary the usual\r\nside-meat and corn pone, diet of the Georgia “cracker.” Scanning the\r\npatch’s ruins of vine and stalk, Andrews espied a handful of onions,\r\nwhich had; remained ungathered. They tempted him as the apple did Eve.\r\nWithout stopping to communicate his intention to me, he sprang from\r\nthe car, snatched the onions from their bed, pulled up, half a dozen\r\ncollard stalks and was on his way back before the guard could make\r\nup his mind to fire upon him. The swiftness of his motions saved his\r\nlife, for had he been more deliberate the guard would have concluded he\r\nwas trying to, escape, and shot him down. As it was he was returning\r\nback before the guard could get his gun up. The onions he had, secured\r\nwere to us more delicious than wine upon the lees. They seemed to find\r\ntheir way into every fiber of our bodies, and invigorate every organ.\r\nThe collard stalks he had snatched up, in the expectation of finding\r\nin them something resembling the nutritious “heart” that we remembered\r\nas children, seeking and, finding in the stalks of cabbage. But we\r\nwere disappointed. The stalks were as dry and rotten as the bones of\r\nSouthern, society. Even hunger could find no meat in them.\r\n\r\nAfter some days of this leisurely journeying toward the South, we\r\nhalted permanently about eighty-six miles from Savannah. There was\r\nno reason why we should stop there more than any place else where we\r\nhad been or were likely to go. It seemed as if the Rebels had simply\r\ntired of hauling us, and dumped us, off. We had another lot of dead,\r\naccumulated since we left Savannah, and the scenes at that place were\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\nThe train returned for another load of prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXV.\r\n\r\nBLACKSHEAR AND PIERCE COUNTRY--WE TAKE UP NEW QUARTERS, BUT ARE CALLED\r\nOUT FOR EXCHANGE--EXCITEMENT OVER SIGNING THE PAROLE--A HAPPY JOURNEY\r\nTO SAVANNAH--GRIEVOUS DISAPPOINTMENT\r\n\r\nWe were informed that the place we were at was Blackshear, and that it\r\nwas the Court House, i. e., the County seat of Pierce County. Where\r\nthey kept the Court House, or County seat, is beyond conjecture to\r\nme, since I could not see a half dozen houses in the whole clearing,\r\nand not one of them was a respectable dwelling, taking even so low a\r\nstandard for respectable dwellings as that afforded by the majority of\r\nGeorgia houses.\r\n\r\nPierce County, as I have since learned by the census report, is one\r\nof the poorest Counties of a poor section of a very poor State. A\r\npopulation of less than two thousand is thinly scattered over its five\r\nhundred square miles of territory, and gain a meager subsistence by a\r\nweak simulation of cultivating patches of its sandy dunes and plains in\r\n“nubbin” corn and dropsical sweet potatos. A few “razor-back” hogs --a\r\nspecies so gaunt and thin that I heard a man once declare that he had\r\nstopped a lot belonging to a neighbor from crawling through the cracks\r\nof a tight board fence by simply tying a knot in their tails--roam the\r\nwoods, and supply all the meat used.\r\n\r\nAndrews used to insist that some of the hogs which we saw were so thin\r\nthat the connection between their fore and hindquarters was only a\r\nsingle thickness of skin, with hair on both sides--but then Andrews\r\nsometimes seemed to me to have a tendency to exaggerate.\r\n\r\nThe swine certainly did have proportions that strongly resembled those\r\nof the animals which children cut out of cardboard. They were like the\r\ngeometrical definition of a superfice--all length and breadth, and no\r\nthickness. A ham from them would look like a palm-leaf fan.\r\n\r\nI never ceased to marvel at the delicate adjustment of the development\r\nof animal life to the soil in these lean sections of Georgia. The poor\r\nland would not maintain anything but lank, lazy men, with few wants,\r\nand none but lank, lazy men, with few wants, sought a maintenance from\r\nit. I may have tangled up cause and effect, in this proposition, but if\r\nso, the reader can disentangle them at his leisure.\r\n\r\nI was not astonished to learn that it took five hundred square miles of\r\nPierce County land to maintain two thousand “crackers,” even as poorly\r\nas they lived. I should want fully that much of it to support one\r\nfair-sized Northern family as it should be.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the cars we were marched off into the pine woods, by the\r\nside of a considerable stream, and told that this was to be our camp. A\r\nheavy guard was placed around us, and a number of pieces of artillery\r\nmounted where they would command the camp.\r\n\r\nWe started in to make ourselves comfortable, as at Millen, by building\r\nshanties. The prisoners we left behind followed us, and we soon had\r\nour old crowd of five or six thousand, who had been our companions at\r\nSavannah and Millers, again with us. The place looked very favorable\r\nfor escape. We knew we were still near the sea coast--really not more\r\nthan forty miles away--and we felt that if we could once get there we\r\nshould be safe. Andrews and I meditated plans of escape, and toiled\r\naway at our cabin.\r\n\r\nAbout a week after our arrival we were startled by an order for the one\r\nthousand of us who had first arrived to get ready to move out. In a few\r\nminutes we were taken outside the guard line, massed close together,\r\nand informed in a few words by a Rebel officer that we were about to be\r\ntaken back to Savannah for exchange.\r\n\r\nThe announcement took away our breath. For an instant the rush of\r\nemotion made us speechless, and when utterance returned, the first use\r\nwe made of it was to join in one simultaneous outburst of acclamation.\r\nThose inside the guard line, understanding what our cheer meant,\r\nanswered us with a loud shout of congratulation--the first real,\r\ngenuine, hearty cheering that had been done since receiving the\r\nannouncement of the exchange at Andersonville, three months before.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the excitement had subsided somewhat, the Rebel proceeded to\r\nexplain that we would all be required to sign a parole. This set us to\r\nthinking. After our scornful rejection of the proposition to enlist in\r\nthe Rebel army, the Rebels had felt around among us considerably as to\r\nhow we were disposed toward taking what was called the “Non-Combatant’s\r\nOath;” that is, the swearing not to take up arms against the Southern\r\nConfederacy again during the war. To the most of us this seemed only a\r\nlittle less dishonorable than joining the Rebel army. We held that our\r\noaths to our own Government placed us at its disposal until it chose to\r\ndischarge us, and we could not make any engagements with its enemies\r\nthat might come in contravention of that duty. In short, it looked very\r\nmuch like desertion, and this we did not feel at liberty to consider.\r\n\r\nThere were still many among us, who, feeling certain that they could\r\nnot survive imprisonment much longer, were disposed to look favorably\r\nupon the Non-Combatant’s Oath, thinking that the circumstances of\r\nthe case would justify their apparent dereliction from duty. Whether\r\nit would or not I must leave to more skilled casuists than myself to\r\ndecide. It was a matter I believed every man must settle with his own\r\nconscience. The opinion that I then held and expressed was, that if a\r\nboy, felt that he was hopelessly sick, and that he could not live if he\r\nremained in prison, he was justified in taking the Oath. In the absence\r\nof our own Surgeons he would have to decide for himself whether he was\r\nsick enough to be warranted in resorting to this means of saving his\r\nlife. If he was in as good health as the majority of us were, with a\r\nreasonable prospect of surviving some weeks longer, there was no excuse\r\nfor taking the Oath, for in that few weeks we might be exchanged, be\r\nrecaptured, or make our escape. I think this was the general opinion of\r\nthe prisoners.\r\n\r\nWhile the Rebel was talking about our signing the parole, there flashed\r\nupon all of us at the same moment, a suspicion that this was a trap to\r\ndelude us into signing the Non-Combatant’s Oath. Instantly there went\r\nup a general shout:\r\n\r\n“Read the parole to us.”\r\n\r\nThe Rebel was handed a blank parole by a companion, and he read over\r\nthe printed condition at the top, which was that those signing agreed\r\nnot to bear arms against the Confederates in the field, or in garrison,\r\nnot to man any works, assist in any expedition, do any sort of guard\r\nduty, serve in any military constabulary, or perform any kind of\r\nmilitary service until properly exchanged.\r\n\r\nFor a minute this was satisfactory; then their ingrained distrust of\r\nany thing a Rebel said or did returned, and they shouted:\r\n\r\n“No, no; let some of us read it; let Ilinoy’ read it--”\r\n\r\nThe Rebel looked around in a puzzled manner.\r\n\r\n“Who the h--l is ‘Illinoy!’ Where is he?” said he.\r\n\r\nI saluted and said:\r\n\r\n“That’s a nickname they give me.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said he, “get up on this stump and read this parole to\r\nthese d---d fools that won’t believe me.”\r\n\r\nI mounted the stump, took the blank from his hand and read it over\r\nslowly, giving as much emphasis as possible to the all-important clause\r\nat the end--“until properly exchanged.” I then said:\r\n\r\n“Boys, this seems all right to me,” and they answered, with almost one\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n“Yes, that’s all right. We’ll sign that.”\r\n\r\nI was never so proud of the American soldier-boy as at that moment.\r\nThey all felt that signing that paper was to give them freedom and\r\nlife. They knew too well from sad experience what the alternative was.\r\nMany felt that unless released another week would see them in their\r\ngraves. All knew that every day’s stay in Rebel hands greatly lessened\r\ntheir chances of life. Yet in all that thousand there was not one\r\nvoice in favor of yielding a tittle of honor to save life. They would\r\nsecure their freedom honorably, or die faithfully. Remember that this\r\nwas a miscellaneous crowd of boys, gathered from all sections of the\r\ncountry, and from many of whom no exalted conceptions of duty and honor\r\nwere expected. I wish some one would point out to me, on the brightest\r\npages of knightly record, some deed of fealty and truth that equals the\r\nsimple fidelity of these unknown heros. I do not think that one of them\r\nfelt that he was doing anything especially meritorious. He only obeyed\r\nthe natural promptings of his loyal heart.\r\n\r\nThe business of signing the paroles was then begun in earnest. We\r\nwere separated into squads according to the first letters of our\r\nnames, all those whose name began with A being placed in one squad,\r\nthose beginning with B, in another, and so on. Blank paroles for each\r\nletter were spread out on boxes and planks at different places, and\r\nthe signing went on under the superintendence of a Rebel Sergeant and\r\none of the prisoners. The squad of M’s selected me to superintend the\r\nsigning for us, and I stood by to direct the boys, and sign for the\r\nvery few who could not write. After this was done we fell into ranks\r\nagain, called the roll of the signers, and carefully compared the\r\nnumber of men with the number of signatures so that nobody should pass\r\nunparoled. The oath was then administered to us, and two day’s rations\r\nof corn meal and fresh beef were issued.\r\n\r\nThis formality removed the last lingering doubt that we had of the\r\nexchange being a reality, and we gave way to the happiest emotions. We\r\ncheered ourselves hoarse, and the fellows still inside followed our\r\nexample, as they expected that they would share our good fortune in a\r\nday or two.\r\n\r\nOur next performance was to set to work, cook our two days’ rations at\r\nonce and eat them. This was not very difficult, as the whole supply\r\nfor two days would hardly make one square meal. That done, many of the\r\nboys went to the guard line and threw their blankets, clothing, cooking\r\nutensils, etc., to their comrades who were still inside. No one thought\r\nthey would have any further use for such things.\r\n\r\n“To-morrow, at this time, thank Heaven,” said a boy near me, as he\r\ntossed his blanket and overcoat back to some one inside, “we’ll be in\r\nGod’s country, and then I wouldn’t touch them d---d lousy old rags with\r\na ten-foot pole.”\r\n\r\nOne of the boys in the M squad was a Maine infantryman, who had been\r\nwith me in the Pemberton building, in Richmond, and had fashioned\r\nhimself a little square pan out of a tin plate of a tobacco press, such\r\nas I have described in an earlier chapter. He had carried it with him\r\never since, and it was his sole vessel for all purposes--for cooking,\r\ncarrying water, drawing rations, etc. He had cherished it as if it were\r\na farm or a good situation. But now, as he turned away from signing\r\nhis name to the parole, he looked at his faithful servant for a minute\r\nin undisguised contempt; on the eve of restoration to happier, better\r\nthings, it was a reminder of all the petty, inglorious contemptible\r\ntrials and sorrows he had endured; he actually loathed it for its\r\nremembrances, and flinging it upon the ground he crushed it out of\r\nall shape and usefulness with his feet, trampling upon it as he would\r\neverything connected with his prison life. Months afterward I had to\r\nlend this man my little can to cook his rations in.\r\n\r\nAndrews and I flung the bright new tin pans we had stolen at Millen\r\ninside the line, to be scrambled for. It was hard to tell who were the\r\nmost surprised at their appearance--the Rebels or our own boys--for\r\nfew had any idea that there were such things in the whole Confederacy,\r\nand certainly none looked for them in the possession of two such\r\npoverty-stricken specimens as we were. We thought it best to retain\r\npossession of our little can, spoon, chess-board, blanket, and overcoat.\r\n\r\nAs we marched down and boarded the train, the Rebels confirmed their\r\nprevious action by taking all the guards from around us. Only some\r\neight or ten were sent to the train, and these quartered themselves in\r\nthe caboose, and paid us no further attention.\r\n\r\nThe train rolled away amid cheering by ourselves and those we left\r\nbehind. One thousand happier boys than we never started on a journey.\r\nWe were going home. That was enough to wreathe the skies with glory,\r\nand fill the world with sweetness and light. The wintry sun had\r\nsomething of geniality and warmth, the landscape lost some of its\r\nrepulsiveness, the dreary palmettos had less of that hideousness which\r\nmade us regard them as very fitting emblems of treason. We even began\r\nto feel a little good-humored contempt for our hateful little Brats of\r\nguards, and to reflect how much vicious education and surroundings were\r\nto be held responsible for their misdeeds.\r\n\r\nWe laughed and sang as we rolled along toward Savannah--going back much\r\nfaster than the came. We re-told old stories, and repeated old jokes,\r\nthat had become wearisome months and months ago, but were now freshened\r\nup and given their olden pith by the joyousness of the occasion. We\r\nrevived and talked over old schemes gotten up in the earlier days\r\nof prison life, of what “we would do when we got out,” but almost\r\nforgotten since, in the general uncertainty of ever getting out. We\r\nexchanged addresses, and promised faithfully to write to each other and\r\ntell how we found everything at home.\r\n\r\nSo the afternoon and night passed. We were too excited to sleep, and\r\npassed the hours watching the scenery, recalling the objects we had\r\npassed on the way to Blackshear, and guessing how near we were to\r\nSavannah.\r\n\r\nThough we were running along within fifteen or twenty miles of the\r\ncoast, with all our guards asleep in the caboose, no one thought of\r\nescape. We could step off the cars and walk over to the seashore as\r\neasily as a man steps out of his door and walks to a neighboring town,\r\nbut why should we? Were we not going directly to our vessels in the\r\nharbor of Savannah, and was it not better to do this, than to take the\r\nchances of escaping, and encounter the difficulties of reaching our\r\nblockaders! We thought so, and we staid on the cars.\r\n\r\nA cold, gray Winter morning was just breaking as we reached Savannah.\r\nOur train ran down in the City, and then whistled sharply and ran back\r\na mile or so; it repeated this maneuver two or three times, the evident\r\ndesign being to keep us on the cars until the people were ready to\r\nreceive us. Finally our engine ran with all the speed she was capable\r\nof, and as the train dashed into the street we found ourselves between\r\ntwo heavy lines of guards with bayonets fixed.\r\n\r\nThe whole sickening reality was made apparent by one glance at the\r\nguard line. Our parole was a mockery, its only object being to get us\r\nto Savannah as easily as possible, and to prevent benefit from our\r\nrecapture to any of Sherman’s Raiders, who might make a dash for the\r\nrailroad while we were in transit. There had been no intention of\r\nexchanging us. There was no exchange going on at Savannah.\r\n\r\nAfter all, I do not think we felt the disappointment as keenly as the\r\nfirst time we were brought to Savannah. Imprisonment had stupefied us;\r\nwe were duller and more hopeless.\r\n\r\nOrdered down out of the cars, we were formed in line in the street.\r\n\r\nSaid a Rebel officer:\r\n\r\n“Now, any of you fellahs that ah too sick to go to Chahlston, step\r\nfohwahd one pace.”\r\n\r\nWe looked at each other an instant, and then the whole line stepped\r\nforward. We all felt too sick to go to Charleston, or to do anything\r\nelse in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVI.\r\n\r\nSPECIMEN CONVERSATION WITH AN AVERAGE NATIVE GEORGIAN--WE LEARN THAT\r\nSHERMAN IS HEADING FOR SAVANNAH--THE RESERVES GET A LITTLE SETTLING\r\nDOWN.\r\n\r\nAs the train left the northern suburbs of Savannah we came upon a scene\r\nof busy activity, strongly contrasting with the somnolent lethargy that\r\nseemed to be the normal condition of the City and its inhabitants.\r\nLong lines of earthworks were being constructed, gangs of negros were\r\nfelling trees, building forts and batteries, making abatis, and toiling\r\nwith numbers of huge guns which were being moved out and placed in\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nAs we had had no new prisoners nor any papers for some weeks--the\r\npapers being doubtless designedly kept away from us--we were at a loss\r\nto know what this meant. We could not understand this erection of\r\nfortifications on that side, because, knowing as we did how well the\r\nflanks of the City were protected by the Savannah and Ogeeche Rivers,\r\nwe could not see how a force from the coast--whence we supposed an\r\nattack must come, could hope to reach the City’s rear, especially as we\r\nhad just come up on the right flank of the City, and saw no sign of our\r\nfolks in that direction.\r\n\r\nOur train stopped for a few minutes at the edge of this line of works,\r\nand an old citizen who had been surveying the scene with senile\r\ninterest, tottered over to our car to take a look at us. He was a type\r\nof the old man of the South of the scanty middle class, the small\r\nfarmer. Long white hair and beard, spectacles with great round, staring\r\nglasses, a broad-brimmed hat of ante-Revolutionary pattern, clothes\r\nthat had apparently descended to him from some ancestor who had come\r\nover with Oglethorpe, and a two-handed staff with a head of buckhorn,\r\nupon which he leaned as old peasants do in plays, formed such an image\r\nas recalled to me the picture of the old man in the illustrations in\r\n“The Dairyman’s Daughter.” He was as garrulous as a magpie, and as\r\nopinionated as a Southern white always is. Halting in front of our car,\r\nhe steadied himself by planting his staff, clasping it with both lean\r\nand skinny hands, and leaning forward upon it, his jaws then addressed\r\nthemselves to motion thus:\r\n\r\n“Boys, who mout these be that ye got?”\r\n\r\nOne of the Guards:--“O, these is some Yanks that we’ve bin hivin’ down\r\nat Camp Sumter.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?” (with an upward inflection of the voice, followed by a close\r\nscrutiny of us through the goggle-eyed glasses,) “Wall, they’re a\r\npowerful ornary lookin’ lot, I’ll declah.”\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the old, gentleman’s perceptive powers were much\r\nmore highly developed than his politeness.\r\n\r\n“Well, they ain’t what ye mout call purty, that’s a fack,” said the\r\nguard.\r\n\r\n“So yer Yanks, air ye?” said the venerable Goober-Grabber, (the\r\nnick-name in the South for Georgians), directing his conversation to\r\nme. “Wall, I’m powerful glad to see ye, an’ ’specially whar ye can’t do\r\nno harm; I’ve wanted to see some Yankees ever sence the beginnin’ of\r\nthe wah, but hev never had no chance. Whah did ye cum from?”\r\n\r\nI seemed called upon to answer, and said: “I came from Illinois; most\r\nof the boys in this car are from Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan and\r\nIowa.”\r\n\r\n“’Deed! All Westerners, air ye? Wall, do ye know I alluz liked the\r\nWesterners a heap sight better than them blue-bellied New England\r\nYankees.”\r\n\r\nNo discussion with a Rebel ever proceeded very far without his making\r\nan assertion like this. It was a favorite declaration of theirs, but\r\nits absurdity was comical, when one remembered that the majority of\r\nthem could not for their lives tell the names of the New England\r\nStates, and could no more distinguish a Downeaster from an Illinoisan\r\nthan they could tell a Saxon from a Bavarian. One day, while I was\r\nholding a conversation similar to the above with an old man on guard,\r\nanother guard, who had been stationed near a squad made up of Germans,\r\nthat talked altogether in the language of the Fatherland, broke in with:\r\n\r\n“Out there by post numbah foahteen, where I wuz yesterday, there’s a\r\nlot of Yanks who jest jabbered away all the hull time, and I hope I may\r\nnever see the back of my neck ef I could understand ary word they said,\r\nAre them the regular blue-belly kind?”\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman entered upon the next stage of the invariable routine\r\nof discussion with a Rebel:\r\n\r\n“Wall, what air you’uns down heah, a-fightin’ we’uns foh?”\r\n\r\nAs I had answered this question several hundred times, I had found the\r\nmost extinguishing reply to be to ask in return:\r\n\r\n“What are you’uns coming up into our country to fight we’uns for?”\r\n\r\nDisdaining to notice this return in kind, the old man passed on to the\r\nnext stage:\r\n\r\n“What are you’uns takin’ ouah niggahs away from us foh?”\r\n\r\nNow, if negros had been as cheap as oreoide watches, it is doubtful\r\nwhether the speaker had ever had money enough in his possession at one\r\ntime to buy one, and yet he talked of taking away “ouah niggahs,” as if\r\nthey were as plenty about his place as hills of corn. As a rule, the\r\nmore abjectly poor a Southerner was, the more readily he worked himself\r\ninto a rage over the idea of “takin’ away ouah niggahs.”\r\n\r\nI replied in burlesque of his assumption of ownership:\r\n\r\n“What are you coming up North to burn my rolling mills and rob my\r\ncomrade here’s bank, and plunder my brother’s store, and burn down my\r\nuncle’s factories?”\r\n\r\nNo reply, to this counter thrust. The old man passed to the third\r\ninevitable proposition:\r\n\r\n“What air you’uns puttin’ ouah niggahs in the field to fight we’uns\r\nfoh?”\r\n\r\nThen the whole car-load shouted back at him at once:\r\n\r\n“What are you’uns putting blood-hounds on our trails to hunt us down,\r\nfor?”\r\n\r\nOld Man--(savagely), “Waal, ye don’t think ye kin ever lick us;\r\nleastways sich fellers as ye air?”\r\n\r\nMyself--“Well, we warmed it to you pretty lively until you caught us.\r\nThere were none of us but what were doing about as good work as any\r\nstock you fellows could turn out. No Rebels in our neighborhood had\r\nmuch to brag on. We are not a drop in the bucket, either. There’s\r\nmillions more better men than we are where we came from, and they are\r\nall determined to stamp out your miserable Confederacy. You’ve got\r\nto come to it, sooner or later; you must knock under, sure as white\r\nblossoms make little apples. You’d better make up your mind to it.”\r\n\r\nOld Man--“No, sah, nevah. Ye nevah kin conquer us! We’re the bravest\r\npeople and the best fighters on airth. Ye nevah kin whip any people\r\nthat’s a fightin’ fur their liberty an’ their right; an’ ye nevah can\r\nwhip the South, sah, any way. We’ll fight ye until all the men air\r\nkilled, and then the wimmen’ll fight ye, sah.”\r\n\r\nMyself--“Well, you may think so, or you may not. From the way our boys\r\nare snatching the Confederacy’s real estate away, it begins to look as\r\nif you’d not have enough to fight anybody on pretty soon. What’s the\r\nmeaning of all this fortifying?”\r\n\r\nOld Man--“Why, don’t you know? Our folks are fixin’ up a place foh Bill\r\nSherman to butt his brains out gain’.”\r\n\r\n“Bill Sherman!” we all shouted in surprise: “Why he ain’t within two\r\nhundred miles of this place, is he?”\r\n\r\nOld Man--“Yes, but he is, tho’. He thinks he’s played a sharp Yankee\r\ntrick on Hood. He found out he couldn’t lick him in a squar’ fight,\r\nnohow; he’d tried that on too often; so he just sneaked ’round behind\r\nhim, and made a break for the center of the State, where he thought\r\nthere was lots of good stealin’ to be done. But we’ll show him. We’ll\r\nsoon hev him just whar we want him, an’ we’ll learn him how to go\r\ntraipesin’ ’round the country, stealin’ nigahs, burnin’ cotton, an’\r\nrunnin’ off folkses’ beef critters. He sees now the scrape he’s got\r\ninto, an’ he’s tryin’ to get to the coast, whar the gun-boats’ll help\r\n’im out. But he’ll nevah git thar, sah; no sah, nevah. He’s mouty nigh\r\nthe end of his rope, sah, and we’ll purty’ soon hev him jist whar you\r\nfellows air, sah.”\r\n\r\nMyself--“Well, if you fellows intended stopping him, why didn’t you do\r\nit up about Atlanta? What did you let him come clear through the State,\r\nburning and stealing, as you say? It was money in your pockets to head\r\nhim off as soon as possible.”\r\n\r\nOld Man--“Oh, we didn’t set nothing afore him up thar except Joe\r\nBrown’s Pets, these sorry little Reserves; they’re powerful little\r\naccount; no stand-up to’em at all; they’d break their necks runnin’\r\naway ef ye so much as bust a cap near to ’em.”\r\n\r\nOur guards, who belonged to these Reserves, instantly felt that the\r\nconversation had progressed farther than was profitable and one of them\r\nspoke up roughly:\r\n\r\n“See heah, old man, you must go off; I can’t hev ye talkin’ to these\r\nprisoners; hits agin my awdahs. Go ’way now!”\r\n\r\nThe old fellow moved off, but as he did he flung this Parthian arrow:\r\n\r\n“When Sherman gits down deep, he’ll find somethin’ different from the\r\nlittle snots of Reserves he ran over up about Milledgeville; he’ll find\r\nhe’s got to fight real soldiers.”\r\n\r\nWe could not help enjoying the rage of the guards, over the low\r\nestimate placed upon the fighting ability of themselves and comrades,\r\nand as they raved, around about what they would do if they were only\r\ngiven an opportunity to go into a line of battle against Sherman, we\r\nadded fuel to the flames of their anger by confiding to each other that\r\nwe always “knew that little Brats whose highest ambition was to murder\r\na defenseless prisoner, could be nothing else than cowards end skulkers\r\nin the field.”\r\n\r\n“Yaas--sonnies,” said Charlie Burroughs, of the Third Michigan, in\r\nthat nasal Yankee drawl, that he always assumed, when he wanted to say\r\nanything very cutting; “you--trundle--bed--soldiers--who’ve never--seen\r\n--a--real--wild--Yankee--don’t--know--how--different--they--are--from\r\n--the kind--that--are--starved--down--to tameness. They’re--jest--as\r\n--different--as--a--lion in--a--menagerie--is--from--his--brother--in\r\n--the woods--who--has--a--nigger--every day--for-dinner. You--fellows\r\n--will--go--into--a--circus--tent--and--throw--tobacco--quids in--the\r\n--face--of--the--lion--in--the--cage--when--you--haven’t--spunk enough\r\n--to--look--a woodchuck--in--the--eye--if--you--met--him--alone. It’s\r\n--lots--o’--fun--to you--to--shoot--down--a--sick--and--starving-man\r\n--in--the--Stockade, but--when--you--see--a--Yank with--a--gun--in--his\r\n--hand--your--livers get--so--white--that--chalk--would--make--a--black\r\n--mark--on--’em.”\r\n\r\nA little later, a paper, which some one had gotten hold of, in some\r\nmysterious manner, was secretly passed to me. I read it as I could find\r\nopportunity, and communicated its contents to the rest of the boys.\r\nThe most important of these was a flaming proclamation by Governor Joe\r\nBrown, setting forth that General Sherman was now traversing the State,\r\ncommitting all sorts of depredations; that he had prepared the way for\r\nhis own destruction, and the Governor called upon all good citizens to\r\nrise en masse, and assist in crushing the audacious invader. Bridges\r\nmust be burned before and behind him, roads obstructed, and every inch\r\nof soil resolutely disputed.\r\n\r\nWe enjoyed this. It showed that the Rebels were terribly alarmed, and\r\nwe began to feel some of that confidence that “Sherman will come out\r\nall right,” which so marvelously animated all under his command.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVII.\r\n\r\nOFF TO CHARLESTON--PASSING THROUGH THE RICE SWAMPS--TWO EXTREMES OF\r\nSOCIETY--ENTRY INTO CHARLESTON--LEISURELY WARFARE--SHELLING THE CITY AT\r\nREGULAR INTERVALS--WE CAMP IN A MASS OF RUINS--DEPARTURE FOR FLORENCE.\r\n\r\nThe train started in a few minutes after the close of the conversation\r\nwith the old Georgian, and we soon came to and crossed the Savannah\r\nRiver into South Carolina. The river was wide and apparently deep; the\r\ntide was setting back in a swift, muddy current; the crazy old bridge\r\ncreaked and shook, and the grinding axles shrieked in the dry journals,\r\nas we pulled across. It looked very much at times as if we were to all\r\ncrash down into the turbid flood--and we did not care very much if we\r\ndid, if we were not going to be exchanged.\r\n\r\nThe road lay through the tide swamp region of South Carolina, a\r\npeculiar and interesting country. Though swamps and fens stretched in\r\nall directions as far as the eye could reach, the landscape was more\r\ngrateful to the eye than the famine-stricken, pine-barrens of Georgia,\r\nwhich had become wearisome to the sight. The soil where it appeared,\r\nwas rich, vegetation was luxuriant; great clumps of laurel showed\r\nglossy richness in the greenness of its verdure, that reminded us of\r\nthe fresh color of the vegetation of our Northern homes, so different\r\nfrom the parched and impoverished look of Georgian foliage. Immense\r\nflocks of wild fowl fluttered around us; the Georgian woods were almost\r\ndestitute of living creatures; the evergreen live-oak, with its queer\r\nfestoons of Spanish moss, and the ugly and useless palmettos gave\r\nnovelty and interest to the view.\r\n\r\nThe rice swamps through which we were passing were the princely\r\npossessions of the few nabobs who before the war stood at the head\r\nof South Carolina aristocracy--they were South Carolina, in fact, as\r\nabsolutely as Louis XIV. was France. In their hands--but a few score\r\nin number--was concentrated about all there was of South Carolina\r\neducation, wealth, culture, and breeding. They represented a pinchbeck\r\nimitation of that regime in France which was happily swept out of\r\nexistence by the Revolution, and the destruction of which more than\r\ncompensated for every drop of blood shed in those terrible days. Like\r\nthe provincial ‘grandes seigneurs’ of Louis XVI’s reign, they were\r\ngay, dissipated and turbulent; “accomplished” in the superficial\r\nacquirements that made the “gentleman” one hundred years ago, but are\r\ngrotesquely out of place in this sensible, solid age, which demands\r\nthat a man shall be of use, and not merely for show. They ran horses\r\nand fought cocks, dawdled through society when young, and intrigued\r\nin politics the rest of their lives, with frequent spice-work of\r\nduels. Esteeming personal courage as a supreme human virtue, and\r\nnever wearying of prating their devotion to the highest standard of\r\nintrepidity, they never produced a General who was even mediocre; nor\r\ndid any one ever hear of a South Carolina regiment gaining distinction.\r\nRegarding politics and the art of government as, equally with arms,\r\ntheir natural vocations, they have never given the Nation a statesman,\r\nand their greatest politicians achieved eminence by advocating ideas\r\nwhich only attracted attention by their balefulness.\r\n\r\nStill further resembling the French ‘grandes seigneurs’ of the\r\neighteenth century, they rolled in wealth wrung from the laborer by\r\nreducing the rewards of his toil to the last fraction that would\r\nsupport his life and strength. The rice culture was immensely\r\nprofitable, because they had found the secret for raising it more\r\ncheaply than even the pauper laborer of the of world could. Their lands\r\nhad cost them nothing originally, the improvements of dikes and ditches\r\nwere comparatively, inexpensive, the taxes were nominal, and their\r\nslaves were not so expensive to keep as good horses in the North.\r\n\r\nThousands of the acres along the road belonged to the Rhetts,\r\nthousands to the Heywards, thousands to the Manigault the Lowndes, the\r\nMiddletons, the Hugers, the Barnwells, and the Elliots--all names too\r\nwell known in the history of our country’s sorrows. Occasionally one\r\nof their stately mansions could be seen on some distant elevation,\r\nsurrounded by noble old trees, and superb grounds. Here they lived\r\nduring the healthy part of the year, but fled thence to summer resort\r\nin the highlands as the miasmatic season approached.\r\n\r\nThe people we saw at the stations along our route were melancholy\r\nillustrations of the evils of the rule of such an oligarchy. There was\r\nno middle class visible anywhere--nothing but the two extremes. A man\r\nwas either a “gentleman,” and wore white shirt and city-made clothes,\r\nor he was a loutish hind, clad in mere apologies for garments. We\r\nthought we had found in the Georgia “cracker” the lowest substratum of\r\nhuman society, but he was bright intelligence compared to the South\r\nCarolina “clay-eater” and “sand-hiller.” The “cracker” always gave\r\nhopes to one that if he had the advantage of common schools, and could\r\nbe made to understand that laziness was dishonorable, he might develop\r\ninto something. There was little foundation for such hope in the\r\naverage low South Carolinian. His mind was a shaking quagmire, which\r\ndid not admit of the erection of any superstructure of education upon\r\nit. The South Carolina guards about us did not know the name of the\r\nnext town, though they had been raised in that section. They did not\r\nknow how far it was there, or to any place else, and they did not care\r\nto learn. They had no conception of what the war was being waged for,\r\nand did not want to find out; they did not know where their regiment\r\nwas going, and did not remember where it had been; they could not tell\r\nhow long they had been in service, nor the time they had enlisted for.\r\nThey only remembered that sometimes they had had “sorter good times,”\r\nand sometimes “they had been powerful bad,” and they hoped there would\r\nbe plenty to eat wherever they went, and not too much hard marching.\r\nThen they wondered “whar a feller’d be likely to make a raise of a\r\ncanteen of good whisky?”\r\n\r\nBad as the whites were, the rice plantation negros were even worse,\r\nif that were possible. Brought to the country centuries ago, as\r\nbrutal savages from Africa, they had learned nothing of Christian\r\ncivilization, except that it meant endless toil, in malarious swamps,\r\nunder the lash of the taskmaster. They wore, possibly, a little more\r\nclothing than their Senegambian ancestors did; they ate corn meal, yams\r\nand rice, instead of bananas, yams and rice, as their forefathers did,\r\nand they had learned a bastard, almost unintelligible, English. These\r\nwere the sole blessings acquired by a transfer from a life of freedom\r\nin the jungles of the Gold Coast, to one of slavery in the swamps of\r\nthe Combahee.\r\n\r\nI could not then, nor can I now, regret the downfall of a system of\r\nsociety which bore such fruits.\r\n\r\nTowards night a distressingly cold breeze, laden with a penetrating\r\nmist, set in from the sea, and put an end to future observations by\r\nmaking us too uncomfortable to care for scenery or social conditions.\r\nWe wanted most to devise a way to keep warm. Andrews and I pulled our\r\novercoat and blanket closely about us, snuggled together so as to make\r\neach one’s meager body afford the other as much heat as possible--and\r\nendured.\r\n\r\nWe became fearfully hungry. It will be recollected that we ate the\r\nwhole of the two days’ rations issued to us at Blackshear at once, and\r\nwe had received nothing since. We reached the sullen, fainting stage\r\nof great hunger, and for hours nothing was said by any one, except an\r\noccasional bitter execration on Rebels and Rebel practices.\r\n\r\nIt was late at night when we reached Charleston. The lights of the\r\nCity, and the apparent warmth and comfort there cheered us up somewhat\r\nwith the hopes that we might have some share in them. Leaving the\r\ntrain, we were marched some distance through well-lighted streets, in\r\nwhich were plenty of people walking to and fro. There were many stores,\r\napparently stocked with goods, and the citizens seemed to be going\r\nabout their business very much as was the custom up North.\r\n\r\nAt length our head of column made a “right turn,” and we marched away\r\nfrom the lighted portion of the City, to a part which I could see\r\nthrough the shadows was filled with ruins. An almost insupportable\r\nodor of gas, escaping I suppose from the ruptured pipes, mingled with\r\nthe cold, rasping air from the sea, to make every breath intensely\r\ndisagreeable.\r\n\r\nAs I saw the ruins, it flashed upon me that this was the burnt district\r\nof the city, and they were putting us under the fire of our own guns.\r\nAt first I felt much alarmed. Little relish as I had on general\r\nprinciples, for being shot I had much less for being killed by our own\r\nmen. Then I reflected that if they put me there--and kept me--a guard\r\nwould have to be placed around us, who would necessarily be in as much\r\nclanger as we were, and I knew I could stand any fire that a Rebel\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nWe were halted in a vacant lot, and sat down, only to jump up the next\r\ninstant, as some one shouted:\r\n\r\n“There comes one of ’em!”\r\n\r\nIt was a great shell from the Swamp Angel Battery. Starting from a\r\npoint miles away, where, seemingly, the sky came down to the sea, was\r\na narrow ribbon of fire, which slowly unrolled itself against the\r\nstar-lit vault over our heads. On, on it came, and was apparently\r\nfollowing the sky down to the horizon behind us. As it reached the\r\nzenith, there came to our ears a prolonged, but not sharp,\r\n\r\n“Whish--ish-ish-ish-ish!”\r\n\r\nWe watched it breathlessly, and it seemed to be long minutes in running\r\nits course; then a thump upon the ground, and a vibration, told that\r\nit had struck. For a moment there was a dead silence. Then came a loud\r\nroar, and the crash of breaking timber and crushing walls. The shell\r\nhad bursted.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later another shell followed, with like results. For awhile\r\nwe forgot all about hunger in the excitement of watching the messengers\r\nfrom “God’s country.” What happiness to be where those shells came\r\nfrom. Soon a Rebel battery of heavy guns somewhere near and in front\r\nof us, waked up, and began answering with dull, slow thumps that made\r\nthe ground shudder. This continued about an hour, when it quieted\r\ndown again, but our shells kept coming over at regular intervals with\r\nthe same slow deliberation, the same prolonged warning, and the same\r\ndreadful crash when they struck. They had already gone on this way for\r\nover a year, and were to keep it up months longer until the City was\r\ncaptured.\r\n\r\nThe routine was the same from day to day, month in, and month out,\r\nfrom early in August, 1863, to the middle of April, 1865. Every few\r\nminutes during the day our folks would hurl a great shell into the\r\nbeleaguered City, and twice a day, for perhaps an hour each time, the\r\nRebel batteries would talk back. It must have been a lesson to the\r\nCharlestonians of the persistent, methodical spirit of the North. They\r\nprided themselves on the length of the time they were holding out\r\nagainst the enemy, and the papers each day had a column headed:\r\n\r\n               “390th DAY OF THE SIEGE,”\r\n\r\nor 391st, 393d, etc., as the number might be since our people opened\r\nfire upon the City. The part where we lay was a mass of ruins. Many\r\nlarge buildings had been knocked down; very many more were riddled\r\nwith shot holes and tottering to their fall. One night a shell passed\r\nthrough a large building about a quarter of a mile from us. It had\r\nalready been struck several times, and was shaky. The shell went\r\nthrough with a deafening crash. All was still for an instant; then it\r\nexploded with a dull roar, followed by more crashing of timber and\r\nwalls. The sound died away and was succeeded by a moment of silence.\r\nFinally the great building fell, a shapeless heap of ruins, with\r\na noise like that of a dozen field pieces. We wanted to cheer but\r\nrestrained ourselves. This was the nearest to us that any shell came.\r\n\r\nThere was only one section of the City in reach of our guns and this\r\nwas nearly destroyed. Fires had come to complete the work begun by\r\nthe shells. Outside of the boundaries of this region, the people felt\r\nthemselves as safe as in one of our northern Cities to-day. They had\r\nan abiding faith that they were clear out of reach of any artillery\r\nthat we could mount. I learned afterwards from some of the prisoners,\r\nwho went into Charleston ahead of us, and were camped on the race\r\ncourse outside of the City, that one day our fellows threw a shell\r\nclear over the City to this race course. There was an immediate and\r\nterrible panic among the citizens. They thought we had mounted some\r\nnew guns of increased range, and now the whole city must go. But the\r\nnext shell fell inside the established limits, and those following\r\nwere equally well behaved, so that the panic abated. I have never\r\nheard any explanation of the matter. It may have been some freak of\r\nthe gun-squad, trying the effect of an extra charge of powder. Had our\r\npeople known of its signal effect, they could have depopulated the\r\nplace in a few hours.\r\n\r\nThe whole matter impressed me queerly. The only artillery I had ever\r\nseen in action were field pieces. They made an earsplitting crash when\r\nthey were discharged, and there was likely to be oceans of trouble for\r\neverybody in that neighborhood about that time. I reasoned from this\r\nthat bigger guns made a proportionally greater amount of noise, and\r\nbred an infinitely larger quantity of trouble. Now I was hearing the\r\ngiants of the world’s ordnance, and they were not so impressive as a\r\nlively battery of three-inch rifles. Their reports did not threaten\r\nto shatter everything, but had a dull resonance, something like that\r\nproduced by striking an empty barrel with a wooden maul. Their shells\r\ndid not come at one in that wildly, ferocious way, with which a missile\r\nfrom a six-pounder convinces every fellow in a long line of battle\r\nthat he is the identical one it is meant for, but they meandered over\r\nin a lazy, leisurely manner, as if time was no object and no person\r\nwould feel put out at having to wait for them. Then, the idea of firing\r\nevery quarter of an hour for a year--fixing up a job for a lifetime,\r\nas Andrews expressed it,--and of being fired back at for an hour at\r\n9 o’clock every morning and evening; of fifty thousand people going\r\non buying and selling, eating, drinking and sleeping, having dances,\r\ndrives and balls, marrying and giving in marriage, all within a few\r\nhundred yards of where the shells were falling-struck me as a most\r\nsingular method of conducting warfare.\r\n\r\nWe received no rations until the day after our arrival, and then they\r\nwere scanty, though fair in quality. We were by this time so hungry\r\nand faint that we could hardly move. We did nothing for hours but lie\r\naround on the ground and try to forget how famished we were. At the\r\nannouncement of rations, many acted as if crazy, and it was all that\r\nthe Sergeants could do to restrain the impatient mob from tearing\r\nthe food away and devouring it, when they were trying to divide it\r\nout. Very many--perhaps thirty--died during the night and morning. No\r\nblame for this is attached to the Charlestonians. They distinguished\r\nthemselves from the citizens of every other place in the Southern\r\nConfederacy where we had been, by making efforts to relieve our\r\ncondition. They sent quite a quantity of food to us, and the Sisters of\r\nCharity came among us, seeking and ministering to the sick. I believe\r\nour experience was the usual one. The prisoners who passed through\r\nCharleston before us all spoke very highly of the kindness shown them\r\nby the citizens there.\r\n\r\nWe remained in Charleston but a few days. One night we were marched\r\ndown to a rickety depot, and put aboard a still more rickety train.\r\nWhen morning came we found ourselves running northward through a pine\r\nbarren country that resembled somewhat that in Georgia, except that the\r\npine was short-leaved, there was more oak and other hard woods, and the\r\nvegetation generally assumed a more Northern look. We had been put into\r\nclose box cars, with guards at the doors and on top. During the night\r\nquite a number of the boys, who had fabricated little saws out of case\r\nknives and fragments of hoop iron, cut holes through the bottoms of the\r\ncars, through which they dropped to the ground and escaped, but were\r\nmostly recaptured after several days. There was no hole cut in our car,\r\nand so Andrews and I staid in.\r\n\r\nJust at dusk we came to the insignificant village of Florence, the\r\njunction of the road leading from Charleston to Cheraw with that\r\nrunning from Wilmington to Kingsville. It was about one hundred and\r\ntwenty miles from Charleston, and the same distance from Wilmington.\r\nAs our train ran through a cut near the junction a darky stood by the\r\ntrack gazing at us curiously. When the train had nearly passed him he\r\nstarted to run up the bank. In the imperfect light the guards mistook\r\nhim for one of us who had jumped from the train. They all fired, and\r\nthe unlucky negro fell, pierced by a score of bullets.\r\n\r\nThat night we camped in the open field. When morning came we saw, a few\r\nhundred yards from us, a Stockade of rough logs, with guards stationed\r\naround it. It was another prison pen. They were just bringing the dead\r\nout, and two men were tossing the bodies up into the four-horse wagon\r\nwhich hauled them away for burial. The men were going about their\r\nbusiness as coolly as if loading slaughtered hogs. One of them would\r\ncatch the body by the feet, and the other by the arms. They would give\r\nit a swing--“One, two, three,” and up it would go into the wagon. This\r\nfilled heaping full with corpses, a negro mounted the wheel horse,\r\ngrasped the lines, and shouted to his animals:\r\n\r\n“Now, walk off on your tails, boys.”\r\n\r\nThe horses strained, the wagon moved, and its load of what were once\r\ngallant, devoted soldiers, was carted off to nameless graves. This was\r\na part of the daily morning routine.\r\n\r\nAs we stood looking at the sickeningly familiar architecture of the\r\nprison pen, a Seventh Indianian near me said, in tones of wearisome\r\ndisgust:\r\n\r\n“Well, this Southern Confederacy is the d---dest country to stand logs\r\non end on God Almighty’s footstool.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVIII.\r\n\r\nFIRST DAYS AT FLORENCE--INTRODUCTION TO LIEUTENANT BARRETT, THE\r\nRED-HEADED KEEPER--A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF OUR NEW QUARTERS--WINDERS\r\nMALIGN INFLUENCE MANIFEST.\r\n\r\nIt did not require a very acute comprehension to understand that the\r\nStockade at which we were gazing was likely to be our abiding place for\r\nsome indefinite period in the future.\r\n\r\nAs usual, this discovery was the death-warrant of many whose lives had\r\nonly been prolonged by the hoping against hope that the movement would\r\nterminate inside our lines. When the portentous palisades showed to\r\na fatal certainty that the word of promise had been broken to their\r\nhearts, they gave up the struggle wearily, lay back on the frozen\r\nground, and died.\r\n\r\nAndrews and I were not in the humor for dying just then. The long\r\nimprisonment, the privations of hunger, the scourging by the elements,\r\nthe death of four out of every five of our number had indeed dulled and\r\nstupefied us--bred an indifference to our own suffering and a seeming\r\ncallosity to that of others, but there still burned in our hearts, and\r\nin the hearts of every one about us, a dull, sullen, smoldering fire of\r\nhate and defiance toward everything Rebel, and a lust for revenge upon\r\nthose who had showered woes upon our heads. There was little fear of\r\ndeath; even the King of Terrors loses most of his awful character upon\r\ntolerably close acquaintance, and we had been on very intimate terms\r\nwith him for a year now. He was a constant visitor, who dropped in upon\r\nus at all hours of the day and night, and would not be denied to any\r\none.\r\n\r\nSince my entry into prison fully fifteen thousand boys had died around\r\nme, and in no one of them had I seen the least, dread or reluctance to\r\ngo. I believe this is generally true of death by disease, everywhere.\r\nOur ever kindly mother, Nature, only makes us dread death when she\r\ndesires us to preserve life. When she summons us hence she tenderly\r\nprovides that we shall willingly obey the call.\r\n\r\nMore than for anything else, we wanted to live now to triumph over\r\nthe Rebels. To simply die would be of little importance, but to die\r\nunrevenged would be fearful. If we, the despised, the contemned, the\r\ninsulted, the starved and maltreated; could live to come back to our\r\noppressors as the armed ministers of retribution, terrible in the\r\nremembrance of the wrongs of ourselves and comrade’s, irresistible as\r\nthe agents of heavenly justice, and mete out to them that Biblical\r\nreturn of seven-fold of what they had measured out to us, then we\r\nwould be content to go to death afterwards. Had the thrice-accursed\r\nConfederacy and our malignant gaolers millions of lives, our great\r\nrevenge would have stomach for them all.\r\n\r\nThe December morning was gray and leaden; dull, somber, snow-laden\r\nclouds swept across the sky before the soughing wind.\r\n\r\nThe ground, frozen hard and stiff, cut and hurt our bare feet at every\r\nstep; an icy breeze drove in through the holes in our rags, and smote\r\nour bodies like blows from sticks. The trees and shrubbery around were\r\nas naked and forlorn as in the North in the days of early Winter before\r\nthe snow comes.\r\n\r\nOver and around us hung like a cold miasma the sickening odor peculiar\r\nto Southern forests in Winter time.\r\n\r\nOut of the naked, repelling, unlovely earth rose the Stockade, in\r\nhideous ugliness. At the gate the two men continued at their monotonous\r\nlabor of tossing the dead of the previous day into the wagon-heaving\r\ninto that rude hearse the inanimate remains that had once tempted\r\ngallant, manly hearts, glowing with patriotism and devotion to\r\ncountry--piling up listlessly and wearily, in a mass of nameless,\r\nemaciated corpses, fluttering with rags, and swarming with vermin, the\r\npride, the joy of a hundred fair Northern homes, whose light had now\r\ngone out forever.\r\n\r\nAround the prison walls shambled the guards, blanketed like Indians,\r\nand with faces and hearts of wolves. Other Rebels--also clad in dingy\r\nbutternut--slouched around lazily, crouched over diminutive fires,\r\nand talked idle gossip in the broadest of “nigger” dialect. Officers\r\nswelled and strutted hither and thither, and negro servants loitered\r\naround, striving to spread the least amount of work over the greatest\r\namount of time.\r\n\r\nWhile I stood gazing in gloomy silence at the depressing surroundings\r\nAndrews, less speculative and more practical, saw a good-sized pine\r\nstump near by, which had so much of the earth washed away from it\r\nthat it looked as if it could be readily pulled up. We had had bitter\r\nexperience in other prisons as to the value of wood, and Andrews\r\nreasoned that as we would be likely to have a repetition of this in the\r\nStockade we were about to enter, we should make an effort to secure\r\nthe stump. We both attacked it, and after a great deal of hard work,\r\nsucceeded in uprooting it. It was very lucky that we did, since it was\r\nthe greatest help in preserving our lives through the three long months\r\nthat we remained at Florence.\r\n\r\nWhile we were arranging our stump so as to carry it to the best\r\nadvantage, a vulgar-faced man, with fiery red hair, and wearing on his\r\ncollar the yellow bars of a Lieutenant, approached. This was Lieutenant\r\nBarrett, commandant of the interior of the prison, and a more inhuman\r\nwretch even than Captain Wirz, because he had a little more brains than\r\nthe commandant at Andersonville, and this extra intellect was wholly\r\ndevoted to cruelty. As he came near he commanded, in loud, brutal tones:\r\n\r\n“Attention, Prisoners!”\r\n\r\nWe all stood up and fell in in two ranks. Said he:\r\n\r\n“By companies, right wheel, march!”\r\n\r\nThis was simply preposterous. As every soldier knows, wheeling by\r\ncompanies is one of the most difficult of manuvers, and requires\r\nsome preparation of a battalion before attempting to execute it. Our\r\nthousand was made up of infantry, cavalry and artillery, representing,\r\nperhaps, one hundred different regiments. We had not been divided off\r\ninto companies, and were encumbered with blankets, tents, cooking\r\nutensils, wood, etc., which prevented our moving with such freedom as\r\nto make a company wheel, even had we been divided up into companies\r\nand drilled for the maneuver. The attempt to obey the command was, of\r\ncourse, a ludicrous failure. The Rebel officers standing near Barrett\r\nlaughed openly at his stupidity in giving such an order, but he was\r\nfurious. He hurled at us a torrent of the vilest abuse the corrupt\r\nimagination of man can conceive, and swore until he was fairly black in\r\nthe face. He fired his revolver off over our heads, and shrieked and\r\nshouted until he had to stop from sheer exhaustion. Another officer\r\ntook command then, and marched us into prison.\r\n\r\nWe found this a small copy of Andersonville. There was a stream running\r\nnorth and south, on either side of which was a swamp. A Stockade of\r\nrough logs, with the bark still on, inclosed several acres. The front\r\nof the prison was toward the West. A piece of artillery stood before\r\nthe gate, and a platform at each corner bore a gun, elevated high\r\nenough to rake the whole inside of the prison. A man stood behind each\r\nof these guns continually, so as to open with them at any moment.\r\nThe earth was thrown up against the outside of the palisades in a\r\nhigh embankment, along the top of which the guards on duty walked, it\r\nbeing high enough to elevate their head, shoulders and breasts above\r\nthe tops of the logs. Inside the inevitable dead-line was traced by\r\nrunning a furrow around the prison-twenty feet from the Stockade--with\r\na plow. In one respect it was an improvement on Andersonville: regular\r\nstreets were laid off, so that motion about the camp was possible, and\r\ncleanliness was promoted. Also, the crowd inside was not so dense as at\r\nCamp Sumter.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners were divided into hundreds and thousands, with Sergeants\r\nat the heads of the divisions. A very good police force-organized and\r\nofficered by the prisoners--maintained order and prevented crime.\r\nThefts and other offenses were punished, as at Andersonville, by the\r\nChief of Police sentencing the offenders to be spanked or tied up.\r\n\r\nWe found very many of our Andersonville acquaintances inside, and for\r\nseveral days comparisons of experience were in order. They had left\r\nAndersonville a few days after us, but were taken to Charleston instead\r\nof Savannah. The same story of exchange was dinned into their ears\r\nuntil they arrived at Charleston, when the truth was told them, that\r\nno exchange was contemplated, and that they had been deceived for the\r\npurpose of getting them safely out of reach of Sherman.\r\n\r\nStill they were treated well in Charleston--better than they had been\r\nanywhere else. Intelligent physicians had visited the sick, prescribed\r\nfor them, furnished them with proper medicines, and admitted the worst\r\ncases to the hospital, where they were given something of the care that\r\none would expect in such an institution. Wheat bread, molasses and rice\r\nwere issued to them, and also a few spoonfuls of vinegar, daily, which\r\nwere very grateful to them in their scorbutic condition. The citizens\r\nsent in clothing, food and vegetables. The Sisters of Charity were\r\nindefatigable in ministering to the sick and dying. Altogether, their\r\nrecollections of the place were quite pleasant.\r\n\r\nDespite the disagreeable prominence which the City had in the Secession\r\nmovement, there was a very strong Union element there, and many men\r\nfound opportunity to do favors to the prisoners and reveal to them how\r\nmuch they abhorred Secession.\r\n\r\nAfter they had been in Charleston a fortnight or more, the yellow fever\r\nbroke out in the City, and soon extended its ravages to the prisoners,\r\nquite a number dying from it.\r\n\r\nEarly in October they had been sent away from the City to their\r\npresent location, which was then a piece of forest land. There was no\r\nstockade or other enclosure about them, and one night they forced the\r\nguard-line, about fifteen hundred escaping, under a pretty sharp fire\r\nfrom the guards. After getting out they scattered, each group taking\r\na different route, some seeking Beaufort, and other places along the\r\nseaboard, and the rest trying to gain the mountains. The whole State\r\nwas thrown into the greatest perturbation by the occurrence. The\r\npapers magnified the proportion of the outbreak, and lauded fulsomely\r\nthe gallantry of the guards in endeavoring to withstand the desperate\r\nassaults of the frenzied Yankees. The people were wrought up into\r\nthe highest alarm as to outrages and excesses that these flying\r\ndesperados might be expected to commit. One would think that another\r\nGrecian horse, introduced into the heart of the Confederate Troy, had\r\nlet out its fatal band of armed men. All good citizens were enjoined\r\nto turn out and assist in arresting the runaways. The vigilance of\r\nall patrolling was redoubled, and such was the effectiveness of the\r\nmeasures taken that before a month nearly every one of the fugitives\r\nhad been retaken and sent back to Florence. Few of these complained\r\nof any special ill-treatment by their captors, while many reported\r\nfrequent acts of kindness, especially when their captors belonged to\r\nthe middle and upper classes. The low-down class--the clay-eaters--on\r\nthe other hand, almost always abused their prisoners, and sometimes, it\r\nis pretty certain, murdered them in cold blood.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Winder came on from Andersonville, and then everything\r\nchanged immediately to the complexion of that place. He began the\r\nerection of the Stockade, and made it very strong. The Dead Line was\r\nestablished, but instead of being a strip of plank upon the top of\r\nlow posts, as at Andersonville, it was simply a shallow trench, which\r\nwas sometimes plainly visible, and sometimes not. The guards always\r\nresolved matters of doubt against the prisoners, and fired on them when\r\nthey supposed them too near where the Dead Line ought to be. Fifteen\r\nacres of ground were enclosed by the palisades, of which five were\r\ntaken up by the creek and swamp, and three or four more by the Dead\r\nLine; main streets, etc., leaving about seven or eight for the actual\r\nuse of the prisoners, whose number swelled to fifteen thousand by the\r\narrivals from Andersonville. This made the crowding together nearly\r\nas bad as at the latter place, and for awhile the same fatal results\r\nfollowed. The mortality, and the sending away of several thousand on\r\nthe sick exchange, reduced the aggregate number at the time of our\r\narrival to about eleven thousand, which gave more room to all, but was\r\nstill not one-twentieth of the space which that number of men should\r\nhave had.\r\n\r\nNo shelter, nor material for constructing any, was furnished. The\r\nground was rather thickly wooded, and covered with undergrowth, when\r\nthe Stockade was built, and certainly no bit of soil was ever so\r\nthoroughly cleared as this was. The trees and brush were cut down and\r\nworked up into hut building materials by the same slow and laborious\r\nprocess that I have described as employed in building our huts at\r\nMillen.\r\n\r\nThen the stumps were attacked for fuel, and with such persistent\r\nthoroughness that after some weeks there was certainly not enough\r\nwoody material left in that whole fifteen acres of ground to kindle a\r\nsmall kitchen fire. The men would begin work on the stump of a good\r\nsized tree, and chip and split it off painfully and slowly until they\r\nhad followed it to the extremity of the tap root ten or fifteen feet\r\nbelow the surface. The lateral roots would be followed with equal\r\ndetermination, and trenches thirty feet long, and two or three feet\r\ndeep were dug with case-knives and half-canteens, to get a root as\r\nthick as one’s wrist. The roots of shrubs and vines were followed up\r\nand gathered with similar industry. The cold weather and the scanty\r\nissues of wood forced men to do this.\r\n\r\nThe huts constructed were as various as the materials and the tastes of\r\nthe builders. Those who were fortunate enough to get plenty of timber\r\nbuilt such cabins as I have described at Millen. Those who had less\r\neked out their materials in various ways. Most frequently all that a\r\nsquad of three or four could get would be a few slender poles and some\r\nbrush. They would dig a hole in the ground two feet deep and large\r\nenough for them all to lie in. Then putting up a stick at each end\r\nand laying a ridge pole across, they, would adjust the rest of their\r\nmaterial so as to form sloping sides capable of supporting earth enough\r\nto make a water-tight roof. The great majority were not so well off as\r\nthese, and had absolutely, nothing of which to build. They had recourse\r\nto the clay of the swamp, from which they fashioned rude sun-dried\r\nbricks, and made adobe houses, shaped like a bee hive, which lasted\r\nvery well until a hard rain came, when they dissolved into red mire\r\nabout the bodies of their miserable inmates.\r\n\r\nRemember that all these makeshifts were practiced within a half-a-mile\r\nof an almost boundless forest, from which in a day’s time the camp\r\ncould have been supplied with material enough to give every man a\r\ncomfortable hut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIX.\r\n\r\nBARRETT’S INSANE CRUELTY--HOW HE PUNISHED THOSE ALLEGED TO BE ENGAGED\r\nIN TUNNELING--THE MISERY IN THE STOCKADE--MEN’S LIMBS ROTTING OFF WITH\r\nDRY GANGRENE.\r\n\r\nWinder had found in Barrett even a better tool for his cruel purposes\r\nthan Wirz. The two resembled each other in many respects. Both were\r\nabsolutely destitute of any talent for commanding men, and could no\r\nmore handle even one thousand men properly than a cabin boy could\r\nnavigate a great ocean steamer. Both were given to the same senseless\r\nfits of insane rage, coming and going without apparent cause, during\r\nwhich they fired revolvers and guns or threw clubs into crowds of\r\nprisoners, or knocked down such as were within reach of their fists.\r\nThese exhibitions were such as an overgrown child might be expected to\r\nmake. They did not secure any result except to increase the prisoners’\r\nwonder that such ill-tempered fools could be given any position of\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nA short time previous to our entry Barrett thought he had reason to\r\nsuspect a tunnel. He immediately announced that no more rations should\r\nbe issued until its whereabouts was revealed and the ringleaders in the\r\nattempt to escape delivered up to him. The rations at that time were\r\nvery scanty, so that the first day they were cut off the sufferings\r\nwere fearful. The boys thought he would surely relent the next day, but\r\nthey did not know their man. He was not suffering any, why should he\r\nrelax his severity? He strolled leisurely out from his dinner table,\r\npicking his teeth with his penknife in the comfortable, self-satisfied\r\nway of a coarse man who has just filled his stomach to his entire\r\ncontent--an attitude and an air that was simply maddening to the\r\nfamishing wretches, of whom he inquired tantalizingly:\r\n\r\n“Air ye’re hungry enough to give up them G-d d d s--s of b----s yet?”\r\n\r\nThat night thirteen thousand men, crazy, fainting with hunger, walked\r\nhither and thither, until exhaustion forced them to become quiet, sat\r\non the ground and pressed their bowels in by leaning against sticks of\r\nwood laid across their thighs; trooped to the Creek and drank water\r\nuntil their gorges rose and they could swallow no more--did everything\r\nin fact that imagination could suggest--to assuage the pangs of the\r\ndeadly gnawing that was consuming their vitals. All the cruelties of\r\nthe terrible Spanish Inquisition, if heaped together, would not sum\r\nup a greater aggregate of anguish than was endured by them. The third\r\nday came, and still no signs of yielding by Barrett. The Sergeants\r\ncounseled together. Something must be done. The fellow would starve\r\nthe whole camp to death with as little compunction as one drowns blind\r\npuppies. It was necessary to get up a tunnel to show Barrett, and to\r\nget boys who would confess to being leaders in the work. A number of\r\ngallant fellows volunteered to brave his wrath, and save the rest of\r\ntheir comrades. It required high courage to do this, as there was no\r\nquestion but that the punishment meted out would be as fearful as the\r\ncruel mind of the fellow could conceive. The Sergeants decided that\r\nfour would be sufficient to answer the purpose; they selected these by\r\nlot, marched them to the gate and delivered them over to Barrett, who\r\nthereupon ordered the rations to be sent in. He was considerate enough,\r\ntoo, to feed the men he was going to torture.\r\n\r\nThe starving men in the Stockade could not wait after the rations were\r\nissued to cook them, but in many instances mixed the meal up with\r\nwater, and swallowed it raw. Frequently their stomachs, irritated by\r\nthe long fast, rejected the mess; any very many had reached the stage\r\nwhere they loathed food; a burning fever was consuming them, and\r\nseething their brains with delirium. Hundreds died within a few days,\r\nand hundreds more were so debilitated by the terrible strain that they\r\ndid not linger long afterward.\r\n\r\nThe boys who had offered themselves as a sacrifice for the rest were\r\nput into a guard house, and kept over night that Barrett might make a\r\nday of the amusement of torturing them. After he had laid in a hearty\r\nbreakfast, and doubtless fortified himself with some of the villainous\r\nsorgum whisky, which the Rebels were now reduced to drinking, he set\r\nabout his entertainment.\r\n\r\nThe devoted four were brought out--one by one--and their hands tied\r\ntogether behind their backs. Then a noose of a slender, strong hemp\r\nrope was slipped over the first one’s thumbs and drawn tight, after\r\nwhich the rope was thrown over a log projecting from the roof of the\r\nguard house, and two or three Rebels hauled upon it until the miserable\r\nYankee was lifted from the ground, and hung suspended by the thumbs,\r\nwhile his weight seemed tearing his limbs from his shoulder blades. The\r\nother three were treated in the same manner.\r\n\r\nThe agony was simply excruciating. The boys were brave, and had\r\nresolved to stand their punishment without a groan, but this was too\r\nmuch for human endurance. Their will was strong, but Nature could not\r\nbe denied, and they shrieked aloud so pitifully that a young Reserve\r\nstanding near fainted. Each one screamed:\r\n\r\n“For God’s sake, kill me! kill me! Shoot me if--you want to, but let me\r\ndown from here!” The only effect of this upon Barrett was to light up\r\nhis brutal face with a leer of fiendish satisfaction. He said to the\r\nguards with a gleeful wink:\r\n\r\n“By God, I’ll learn these Yanks to be more afeard of me than of the old\r\ndevil himself. They’ll soon understand that I’m not the man to fool\r\nwith. I’m old pizen, I am, when I git started. Jest hear ’em squeal,\r\nwon’t yer?”\r\n\r\nThen walking from one prisoner to another, he said:\r\n\r\n“D---n yer skins, ye’ll dig tunnels, will ye? Ye’ll try to git out, and\r\nrun through the country stealin’ and carryin’ off niggers, and makin’\r\nmore trouble than yer d----d necks are worth. I’ll learn ye all about\r\nthat. If I ketch ye at this sort of work again, d----d ef I don’t kill\r\nye ez soon ez I ketch ye.”\r\n\r\nAnd so on, ad infinitum. How long the boys were kept up there\r\nundergoing this torture can not be said. Perhaps it was an hour or\r\nmore. To the locker-on it seemed long hours, to the poor fellows\r\nthemselves it was ages. When they were let down at last, all fainted,\r\nand were carried away to the hospital, where they were weeks in\r\nrecovering from the effects. Some of them were crippled for life.\r\n\r\nWhen we came into the prison there were about eleven thousand there.\r\nMore uniformly wretched creatures I had never before seen. Up to the\r\ntime of our departure from Andersonville the constant influx of new\r\nprisoners had prevented the misery and wasting away of life from\r\nbecoming fully realized. Though thousands were continually dying,\r\nthousands more of healthy, clean, well-clothed men were as continually\r\ncoming in from the front, so that a large portion of those inside\r\nlooked in fairly good condition. Put now no new prisoners had come in\r\nfor months; the money which made such a show about the sutler shops of\r\nAndersonville had been spent; and there was in every face the same look\r\nof ghastly emaciation, the same shrunken muscles and feeble limbs, the\r\nsame lack-luster eyes and hopeless countenances.\r\n\r\nOne of the commonest of sights was to see men whose hands and feet\r\nwere simply rotting off. The nights were frequently so cold that ice\r\na quarter of an inch thick formed on the water. The naked frames of\r\nstarving men were poorly calculated to withstand this frosty rigor, and\r\nthousands had their extremities so badly frozen as to destroy the life\r\nin those parts, and induce a rotting of the tissues by a dry gangrene.\r\nThe rotted flesh frequently remained in its place for a long time --a\r\nloathsome but painless mass, that gradually sloughed off, leaving the\r\nsinews that passed through it to stand out like shining, white cords.\r\n\r\nWhile this was in some respects less terrible than the hospital\r\ngangrene at Andersonville, it was more generally diffused, and dreadful\r\nto the last degree. The Rebel Surgeons at Florence did not follow\r\nthe habit of those at Andersonville, and try to check the disease by\r\nwholesale amputation, but simply let it run its course, and thousands\r\nfinally carried their putrefied limbs through our lines, when the\r\nConfederacy broke up in the Spring, to be treated by our Surgeons.\r\n\r\nI had been in prison but a little while when a voice called out from a\r\nhole in the ground, as I was passing:\r\n\r\n“S-a-y, Sergeant! Won’t you please take these shears and cut my toes\r\noff?”\r\n\r\n“What?” said I, in amazement, stopping in front of the dugout.\r\n\r\n“Just take these shears, won’t you, and cut my toes off?” answered the\r\ninmate, an Indiana infantryman--holding up a pair of dull shears in his\r\nhand, and elevating a foot for me to look at.\r\n\r\nI examined the latter carefully. All the flesh of the toes, except\r\nlittle pads at the ends, had rotted off, leaving the bones as clean as\r\nif scraped. The little tendons still remained, and held the bones to\r\ntheir places, but this seemed to hurt the rest of the feet and annoy\r\nthe man.\r\n\r\n“You’d better let one of the Rebel doctors see this,” I said, after\r\nfinishing my survey, “before you conclude to have them off. May be they\r\ncan be saved.”\r\n\r\n“No; d----d if I’m going to have any of them Rebel butchers fooling\r\naround me. I’d die first, and then I wouldn’t,” was the reply. “You can\r\ndo it better than they can. It’s just a little snip. Just try it.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t like to,” I replied. “I might lame you for life, and make you\r\nlots of trouble.”\r\n\r\n“O, bother! what business is that of yours? They’re my toes, and I want\r\n’em off. They hurt me so I can’t sleep. Come, now, take the shears and\r\ncut ’em off.”\r\n\r\nI yielded, and taking the shears, snipped one tendon after another,\r\nclose to the feet, and in a few seconds had the whole ten toes lying in\r\na heap at the bottom of the dug-out. I picked them up and handed them\r\nto their owner, who gazed at them, complacently, and remarked:\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m darned glad they’re off. I won’t be bothered with corns any\r\nmore, I flatter myself.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXX.\r\n\r\nHOUSE AND CLOTHES--EFFORTS TO ERECT A SUITABLE RESIDENCE--DIFFICULTIES\r\nATTENDING THIS--VARIETIES OF FLORENTINE ARCHITECTURE--WAITING FOR DEAD\r\nMEN’S CLOTHES--CRAVING FOR TOBACCO.\r\n\r\nWe were put into the old squads to fill the places of those who had\r\nrecently died, being assigned to these vacancies according to the\r\ninitials of our surnames, the same rolls being used that we had signed\r\nas paroles. This separated Andrews and me, for the “A’s” were taken to\r\nfill up the first hundreds of the First Thousand, while the “M’s,” to\r\nwhich I belonged, went into the next Thousand.\r\n\r\nI was put into the Second Hundred of the Second Thousand, and its\r\nSergeant dying shortly after, I was given his place, and commanded the\r\nhundred, drew its rations, made out its rolls, and looked out for its\r\nsick during the rest of our stay there.\r\n\r\nAndrews and I got together again, and began fixing up what little we\r\ncould to protect ourselves against the weather. Cold as this was we\r\ndecided that it was safer to endure it and risk frost-biting every\r\nnight than to build one of the mud-walled and mud-covered holes that\r\nso many, lived in. These were much warmer than lying out on the frozen\r\nground, but we believed that they were very unhealthy, and that no one\r\nlived long who inhabited them.\r\n\r\nSo we set about repairing our faithful old blanket--now full of great\r\nholes. We watched the dead men to get pieces of cloth from their\r\ngarments to make patches, which we sewed on with yarn raveled from\r\nother fragments of woolen cloth. Some of our company, whom we found in\r\nthe prison, donated us the three sticks necessary to make tent-poles\r\n--wonderful generosity when the preciousness of firewood is remembered.\r\nWe hoisted our blanket upon these; built a wall of mud bricks at one\r\nend, and in it a little fireplace to economize our scanty fuel to the\r\nlast degree, and were once more at home, and much better off than most\r\nof our neighbors.\r\n\r\nOne of these, the proprietor of a hole in the ground covered with an\r\narch of adobe bricks, had absolutely no bed-clothes except a couple of\r\nshort pieces of board--and very little other clothing. He dug a trench\r\nin the bottom of what was by courtesy called his tent, sufficiently\r\nlarge to contain his body below his neck. At nightfall he would crawl\r\ninto this, put his two bits of board so that they joined over his\r\nbreast, and then say: “Now, boys, cover me over;” whereupon his friends\r\nwould cover him up with dry sand from the sides of his domicile, in\r\nwhich he would slumber quietly till morning, when he would rise, shake\r\nthe sand from his garments, and declare that he felt as well refreshed\r\nas if he had slept on a spring mattress.\r\n\r\nThere has been much talk of earth baths of late years in scientific\r\nand medical circles. I have been sorry that our Florence comrade if he\r\nstill lives--did not contribute the results of his experience.\r\n\r\nThe pinching cold cured me of my repugnance to wearing dead men’s\r\nclothes, or rather it made my nakedness so painful that I was glad\r\nto cover it as best I could, and I began foraging among the corpses\r\nfor garments. For awhile my efforts to set myself up in the mortuary\r\nsecond-hand clothing business were not all successful. I found that\r\ndying men with good clothes were as carefully watched over by sets\r\nof fellows who constituted themselves their residuary legatees as if\r\nthey were men of fortune dying in the midst of a circle of expectant\r\nnephews and nieces. Before one was fairly cold his clothes would be\r\nappropriated and divided, and I have seen many sharp fights between\r\ncontesting claimants.\r\n\r\nI soon perceived that my best chance was to get up very early in the\r\nmorning, and do my hunting. The nights were so cold that many could\r\nnot sleep, and they would walk up and down the streets, trying to keep\r\nwarm by exercise. Towards morning, becoming exhausted, they would lie\r\ndown on the ground almost anywhere, and die. I have frequently seen so\r\nmany as fifty of these. My first “find” of any importance was a young\r\nPennsylvania Zouave, who was lying dead near the bridge that crossed\r\nthe Creek. His clothes were all badly worn, except his baggy, dark\r\ntrousers, which were nearly new. I removed these, scraped out from each\r\nof the dozens of great folds in the legs about a half pint of lice,\r\nand drew the garments over my own half-frozen limbs, the first real\r\ncovering those members had had for four or five months. The pantaloons\r\nonly came down about half-way between my knees and feet, but still\r\nthey were wonderfully comfortable to what I had been--or rather not\r\nbeen--wearing. I had picked up a pair of boot bottoms, which answered\r\nme for shoes, and now I began a hunt for socks. This took several\r\nmorning expeditions, but on one of them I was rewarded with finding a\r\ncorpse with a good brown one --army make--and a few days later I got\r\nanother, a good, thick genuine one, knit at home, of blue yarn, by some\r\npatient, careful housewife. Almost the next morning I had the good\r\nfortune to find a dead man with a warm, whole, infantry dress-coat, a\r\nmost serviceable garment. As I still had for a shirt the blouse Andrews\r\nhad given me at Millen, I now considered my wardrobe complete, and left\r\nthe rest of the clothes to those who were more needy than I.\r\n\r\nThose who used tobacco seemed to suffer more from a deprivation of\r\nthe weed than from lack of food. There were no sacrifices they would\r\nnot make to obtain it, and it was no uncommon thing for boys to trade\r\noff half their rations for a chew of “navy plug.” As long as one had\r\nanything--especially buttons--to trade, tobacco could be procured from\r\nthe guards, who were plentifully supplied with it. When means of barter\r\nwere gone, chewers frequently became so desperate as to beg the guards\r\nto throw them a bit of the precious nicotine. Shortly after our arrival\r\nat Florence, a prisoner on the East Side approached one of the Reserves\r\nwith the request:\r\n\r\n“Say, Guard, can’t you give a fellow a chew of tobacco?”\r\n\r\nTo which the guard replied:\r\n\r\n“Yes; come right across the line there and I’ll drop you down a bit.”\r\n\r\nThe unsuspecting prisoner stepped across the Dead Line, and the\r\nguard--a boy of sixteen--raised his gun and killed him.\r\n\r\nAt the North Side of the prison, the path down to the Creek lay right\r\nalong side of the Dead Line, which was a mere furrow in the ground.\r\n\r\nAt night the guards, in their zeal to kill somebody, were very likely\r\nto imagine that any one going along the path for water was across the\r\nDead Line, and fire upon him. It was as bad as going upon the skirmish\r\nline to go for water after nightfall. Yet every night a group of boys\r\nwould be found standing at the head of the path crying out:\r\n\r\n“Fill your buckets for a chew of tobacco.”\r\n\r\nThat is, they were willing to take all the risk of running that\r\ngauntlet for this moderate compensation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXI.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER--RATIONS OF WOOD AND FOOD GROW LESS DAILY--UNCERTAINTY AS TO\r\nTHE MORTALITY AT FLORENCE--EVEN THE GOVERNMENT’S STATISTICS ARE VERY\r\nDEFICIENT--CARE FOB THE SICK.\r\n\r\nThe rations of wood grew smaller as the weather grew colder,\r\nuntil at last they settled down to a piece about the size of a\r\nkitchen rolling-pin per day for each man. This had to serve for\r\nall purposes--cooking, as well as warming. We split the rations up\r\ninto slips about the size of a carpenter’s lead pencil, and used\r\nthem parsimoniously, never building a fire so big that it could\r\nnot be covered with a half-peck measure. We hovered closely over\r\nthis--covering it, in fact, with our hands and bodies, so that not a\r\nparticle of heat was lost. Remembering the Indian’s sage remark, “That\r\nthe white man built a big fire and sat away off from it; the Indian\r\nmade a little fire and got up close to it,” we let nothing in the\r\nway of caloric be wasted by distance. The pitch-pine produced great\r\nquantities of soot, which, in cold and rainy days, when we hung over\r\nthe fires all the time, blackened our faces until we were beyond the\r\nrecognition of intimate friends.\r\n\r\nThere was the same economy of fuel in cooking. Less than half as much\r\nas is contained in a penny bunch of kindling was made to suffice in\r\npreparing our daily meal. If we cooked mush we elevated our little can\r\nan inch from the ground upon a chunk of clay, and piled the little\r\nsticks around it so carefully that none should burn without yielding\r\nall its heat to the vessel, and not one more was burned than absolutely\r\nnecessary. If we baked bread we spread the dough upon our chessboard,\r\nand propped it up before the little fire-place, and used every particle\r\nof heat evolved. We had to pinch and starve ourselves thus, while\r\nwithin five minutes’ walk from the prison-gate stood enough timber to\r\nbuild a great city.\r\n\r\nThe stump Andrews and I had the foresight to save now did us excellent\r\nservice. It was pitch pine, very fat with resin, and a little piece\r\nsplit off each day added much to our fires and our comfort.\r\n\r\nOne morning, upon examining the pockets of an infantryman of my hundred\r\nwho had just died, I had the wonderful luck to find a silver quarter.\r\nI hurried off to tell Andrews of our unexpected good fortune. By an\r\neffort he succeeded in calming himself to the point of receiving the\r\nnews with philosophic coolness, and we went into Committee of the\r\nWhole Upon the State of Our Stomachs, to consider how the money could\r\nbe spent to the best advantage. At the south side of the Stockade on\r\nthe outside of the timbers, was a sutler shop, kept by a Rebel, and\r\ncommunicating with the prison by a hole two or three feet square,\r\ncut through the logs. The Dead Line was broken at this point, so as\r\nto permit prisoners to come up to the hole to trade. The articles\r\nfor sale were corn meal and bread, flour and wheat bread, meat,\r\nbeaus, molasses, honey, sweet potatos, etc. I went down to the place,\r\ncarefully inspected the stock, priced everything there, and studied\r\nthe relative food value of each. I came back, reported my observations\r\nand conclusions to Andrews, and then staid at the tent while he went\r\non a similar errand. The consideration of the matter was continued\r\nduring the day and night, and the next morning we determined upon\r\ninvesting our twenty-five cents in sweet potatos, as we could get\r\nnearly a half-bushel of them, which was “more fillin’ at the price,” to\r\nuse the words of Dickens’s Fat Boy, than anything else offered us. We\r\nbought the potatos, carried them home in our blanket, buried them in\r\nthe bottom of our tent, to keep them from being stolen, and restricted\r\nourselves to two per day until we had eaten them all.\r\n\r\nThe Rebels did something more towards properly caring for the sick than\r\nat Andersonville. A hospital was established in the northwestern corner\r\nof the Stockade, and separated from the rest of the camp by a line of\r\npolice, composed of our own men. In this space several large sheds\r\nwere erected, of that rude architecture common to the coarser sort of\r\nbuildings in the South. There was not a nail or a bolt used in their\r\nentire construction. Forked posts at the ends and sides supported poles\r\nupon which were laid the long “shakes,” or split shingles, forming the\r\nroofs, and which were held in place by other poles laid upon them. The\r\nsides and ends were enclosed by similar “shakes,” and altogether they\r\nformed quite a fair protection against the weather. Beds of pine leaves\r\nwere provided for the sick, and some coverlets, which our Sanitary\r\nCommission had been allowed to send through. But nothing was done to\r\nbathe or cleanse them, or to exchange their lice-infested garments\r\nfor others less full of torture. The long tangled hair and whiskers\r\nwere not cut, nor indeed were any of the commonest suggestions for\r\nthe improvement of the condition of the sick put into execution. Men\r\nwho had laid in their mud hovels until they had become helpless and\r\nhopeless, were admitted to the hospital, usually only to die.\r\n\r\nThe diseases were different in character from those which swept off the\r\nprisoners at Andersonville. There they were mostly of the digestive\r\norgans; here of the respiratory. The filthy, putrid, speedily fatal\r\ngangrene of Andersonville became here a dry, slow wasting away of\r\nthe parts, which continued for weeks, even months, without being\r\nnecessarily fatal. Men’s feet and legs, and less frequently their hands\r\nand arms, decayed and sloughed off. The parts became so dead that a\r\nknife could be run through them without causing a particle of pain. The\r\ndead flesh hung on to the bones and tendons long after the nerves and\r\nveins had ceased to perform their functions, and sometimes startled one\r\nby dropping off in a lump, without causing pain or hemorrhage.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of these was, of course, frightful, or would have been,\r\nhad we not become accustomed to them. The spectacle of men with their\r\nfeet and legs a mass of dry ulceration, which had reduced the flesh\r\nto putrescent deadness, and left the tendons standing out like cords,\r\nwas too common to excite remark or even attention. Unless the victim\r\nwas a comrade, no one specially heeded his condition. Lung diseases\r\nand low fevers ravaged the camp, existing all the time in a more or\r\nless virulent condition, according to the changes of the weather,\r\nand occasionally ragging in destructive epidemics. I am unable to\r\nspeak with any degree of definiteness as to the death rate, since I\r\nhad ceased to interest myself about the number dying each day. I had\r\nnow been a prisoner a year, and had become so torpid and stupefied,\r\nmentally and physically, that I cared comparatively little for anything\r\nsave the rations of food and of fuel. The difference of a few spoonfuls\r\nof meal, or a large splinter of wood in the daily issues to me, were\r\nof more actual importance than the increase or decrease of the death\r\nrate by a half a score or more. At Andersonville I frequently took the\r\ntrouble to count the number of dead and living, but all curiosity of\r\nthis kind had now died out.\r\n\r\nNor can I find that anybody else is in possession of much more than\r\nmy own information on the subject. Inquiry at the War Department has\r\nelicited the following letters:\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe prison records of Florence, S. C., have never come to light,\r\nand therefore the number of prisoners confined there could not be\r\nascertained from the records on file in this office; nor do I think\r\nthat any statement purporting to show that number has ever been made.\r\n\r\nIn the report to Congress of March 1, 1869, it was shown from records\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nEscaped, fifty-eight; paroled, one; died, two thousand seven hundred\r\nand ninety-three. Total, two thousand eight hundred and fifty-two.\r\n\r\nSince date of said report there have been added to the records as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nDied, two hundred and twelve; enlisted in Rebel army, three hundred and\r\ntwenty-six. Total, five hundred and thirty-eight.\r\n\r\nMaking a total disposed of from there, as shown by records on file, of\r\nthree thousand three hundred and ninety.\r\n\r\nThis, no doubt, is a small proportion of the number actually confined\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThe hospital register on file contains that part only of the alphabet\r\nsubsequent to, and including part of the letter S, but from this\r\nregister, it is shown that the prisoners were arranged in hundreds\r\nand thousands, and the hundred and thousand to which he belonged is\r\nrecorded opposite each man’s name on said register. Thus:\r\n\r\n“John Jones, 11th thousand, 10th hundred.”\r\n\r\nEleven thousand being the highest number thus recorded, it is fair to\r\npresume that not less than that number were confined there on a certain\r\ndate, and that more than that number were confined there during the\r\ntime it was continued as a prison.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nStatement showing the whole number of Federals and Confederates\r\ncaptured, (less the number paroled on the field), the number who died\r\nwhile prisoners, and the percentage of deaths, 1861-1865\r\n\r\n                                 FEDERALS\r\nCaptured .................................................. 187,818\r\nDied, (as shown by prison and hospital records on file).... 30,674\r\nPercentage of deaths ...................................... 16.375\r\n\r\n                               CONFEDERATES\r\nCaptured .................................................. 227,570\r\nDied ...................................................... 26,774\r\nPercentage of deaths ...................................... 11.768\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the detailed statement prepared for Congress dated March 1, 1869,\r\nthe whole number of deaths given as shown by Prisoner of War records\r\nwas twenty-six thousand three hundred and twenty-eight, but since that\r\ndate evidence of three thousand six hundred and twenty-eight additional\r\ndeaths has been obtained from the captured Confederate records, making\r\na total of twenty-nine thousand nine hundred and fifty-six as above\r\nshown. This is believed to be many thousands less than the actual\r\nnumber of Federal prisoners who died in Confederate prisons, as we have\r\nno records from those at Montgomery Ala., Mobile, Ala., Millen, Ga.,\r\nMarietta, Ga., Atlanta, Ga., Charleston, S. C., and others. The records\r\nof Florence, S. C., and Salisbury, N. C., are very incomplete. It also\r\nappears from Confederate inspection reports of Confederate prisons,\r\nthat large percentage of the deaths occurred in prison quarter without\r\nthe care or knowledge of the Surgeon. For the month of December, 1864\r\nalone, the Confederate “burial report”; Salisbury, N. C., show that\r\nout, of eleven hundred and fifty deaths, two hundred and twenty-three,\r\nor twenty per cent., died in prison quarters and are not accounted\r\nfor in the report of the Surgeon, and therefore not taken into\r\nconsideration in the above report, as the only records of said prisons\r\non file (with one exception) are the Hospital records. Calculating the\r\npercentage of deaths on this basis would give the number of deaths at\r\nthirty-seven thousand four hundred and forty-five and percentage of\r\ndeaths at 20.023.\r\n\r\n              [End of the Letters from the War Department.]\r\n\r\nIf we assume that the Government’s records of Florence as correct, it\r\nwill be apparent that one man in every three die there, since, while\r\nthere might have been as high as fifty thousand at one time in the\r\nprison, during the last three months of its existence I am quite sure\r\nthat the number did not exceed seven thousand. This would make the\r\nmortality much greater than at Andersonville, which it undoubtedly\r\nwas, since the physical condition of the prisoners confined there\r\nhad been greatly depressed by their long confinement, while the bulk\r\nc the prisoners at Andersonville were those who had been brought\r\nthither directly from the field. I think also that all who experienced\r\nconfinement in the two places are united in pronouncing Florence to be,\r\non the whole, much the worse place and more fatal to life.\r\n\r\nThe medicines furnished the sick were quite simple in nature and\r\nmainly composed of indigenous substances. For diarrhea red pepper and\r\ndecoctions of blackberry root and of pine leave were given. For coughs\r\nand lung diseases, a decoction of wild cherry bark was administered.\r\nChills and fever were treated with decoctions of dogwood bark, and\r\nfever patients who craved something sour, were given a weak acid drink,\r\nmade by fermenting a small quantity of meal in a barrel of water. All\r\nthese remedies were quite good in their way, and would have benefitted\r\nthe patients had they been accompanied by proper shelter, food and\r\nclothing. But it was idle to attempt to arrest with blackberry root the\r\ndiarrhea, or with wild cherry bark the consumption of a man lying in a\r\ncold, damp, mud hovel, devoured by vermin, and struggling to maintain\r\nlife upon less than a pint of unsalted corn meal per diem.\r\n\r\nFinding that the doctors issued red pepper for diarrhea, and an\r\nimitation of sweet oil made from peanuts, for the gangrenous sores\r\nabove described, I reported to them an imaginary comrade in my tent,\r\nwhose symptoms indicated those remedies, and succeeded in drawing a\r\nsmall quantity of each, two or three times a week. The red pepper I\r\nused to warm up our bread and mush, and give some different taste to\r\nthe corn meal, which had now become so loathsome to us. The peanut\r\noil served to give a hint of the animal food we hungered for. It was\r\ngreasy, and as we did not have any meat for three months, even this\r\nflimsy substitute was inexpressibly grateful to palate and stomach. But\r\none morning the Hospital Steward made a mistake, and gave me castor oil\r\ninstead, and the consequences were unpleasant.\r\n\r\nA more agreeable remembrance is that of two small apples, about the\r\nsize of walnuts, given me by a boy named Henry Clay Montague Porter, of\r\nthe Sixteenth Connecticut. He had relatives living in North Carolina,\r\nwho sent him a small packs of eatables, out of which, in the fulness\r\nof his generous heart he gave me this share--enough to make me always\r\nremember him with kindness.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of eatables reminds me of an incident. Joe Darling, of the\r\nFirst Maine, our Chief of Police, had a sister living at Augusta,\r\nGa., who occasionally came to Florence with basket of food and other\r\nnecessaries for her brother. On one of these journeys, while sitting\r\nin Colonel Iverson’s tent, waiting for her brother to be brought out\r\nof prison, she picked out of her basket a nicely browned doughnut and\r\nhanded it to the guard pacing in front of the tent, with:\r\n\r\n“Here, guard, wouldn’t you like a genuine Yankee doughnut?”\r\n\r\nThe guard-a lank, loose-jointed Georgia cracker--who in all his life\r\nseen very little more inviting food than the his hominy and molasses,\r\nupon which he had been raised, took the cake, turned it over and\r\ninspected it curiously for some time without apparently getting the\r\nleast idea of what it was for, and then handed it back to the donor,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n“Really, mum, I don’t believe I’ve got any use for it”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXII.\r\n\r\nDULL WINTER DAYS--TOO WEAK AND TOO STUPID To AMUSE OURSELVES--ATTEMPTS\r\nOF THE REBELS TO RECRUIT US INTO THEIR ARMY--THE CLASS OF MEN THEY\r\nOBTAINED --VENGEANCE ON “THE GALVANIZED”--A SINGULAR EXPERIENCE--RARE\r\nGLIMPSES OF FUN--INABILITY OF THE REBELS TO COUNT.\r\n\r\nThe Rebels continued their efforts to induce prisoners to enlist in\r\ntheir army, and with much better success than at any previous time.\r\nMany men had become so desperate that they were reckless as to what\r\nthey did. Home, relatives, friends, happiness--all they had remembered\r\nor looked forward to, all that had nerved them up to endure the present\r\nand brave the future--now seemed separated from them forever by a\r\nyawning and impassable chasm. For many weeks no new prisoners had come\r\nin to rouse their drooping courage with news of the progress of our\r\narms towards final victory, or refresh their remembrances of home, and\r\nthe gladsomeness of “God’s Country.” Before them they saw nothing but\r\nweeks of slow and painful progress towards bitter death. The other\r\nalternative was enlistment in the Rebel army.\r\n\r\nAnother class went out and joined, with no other intention than to\r\nescape at the first opportunity. They justified their bad faith to the\r\nRebels by recalling the numberless instances of the Rebels’ bad faith\r\nto us, and usually closed their arguments in defense of their course\r\nwith:\r\n\r\n“No oath administered by a Rebel can have any binding obligation. These\r\nmen are outlaws who have not only broken their oaths to the Government,\r\nbut who have deserted from its service, and turned its arms against\r\nit. They are perjurers and traitors, and in addition, the oath they\r\nadminister to us is under compulsion and for that reason is of no\r\naccount.”\r\n\r\nStill another class, mostly made up from the old Raider crowd, enlisted\r\nfrom natural depravity. They went out more than for anything else\r\nbecause their hearts were prone to evil and they did that which was\r\nwrong in preference to what was right. By far the largest portion of\r\nthose the Rebels obtained were of this class, and a more worthless\r\ncrowd of soldiers has not been seen since Falstaff mustered his famous\r\nrecruits.\r\n\r\nAfter all, however, the number who deserted their flag was\r\nastonishingly small, considering all the circumstances. The official\r\nreport says three hundred and twenty-six, but I imaging this is\r\nunder the truth, since quite a number were turned back in after\r\ntheir utter uselessness had been demonstrated. I suppose that five\r\nhundred “galvanized,” as we termed it, but this was very few when the\r\nhopelessness of exchange, the despair of life, and the wretchedness of\r\nthe condition of the eleven or twelve thousand inside the Stockade is\r\nremembered.\r\n\r\nThe motives actuating men to desert were not closely analyzed by us,\r\nbut we held all who did so as despicable scoundrels, too vile to be\r\nadequately described in words. It was not safe for a man to announce\r\nhis intention of “galvanizing,” for he incurred much danger of being\r\nbeaten until he was physically unable to reach the gate. Those who went\r\nover to the enemy had to use great discretion in letting the Rebel\r\nofficer, know so much of their wishes as would secure their being\r\ntaker outside. Men were frequently knocked down and dragged away while\r\ntelling the officers they wanted to go out.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion one hundred or more of the raider crowd who had\r\ngalvanized, were stopped for a few hours in some little Town, on\r\ntheir way to the front. They lost no time in stealing everything they\r\ncould lay their hands upon, and the disgusted Rebel commander ordered\r\nthem to be returned to the Stockade. They came in in the evening, all\r\nwell rigged out in Rebel uniforms, and carrying blankets. We chose to\r\nconsider their good clothes and equipments an aggravation of their\r\noffense and an insult to ourselves. We had at that time quite a squad\r\nof negro soldiers inside with us. Among them was a gigantic fellow with\r\na fist like a wooden beetle. Some of the white boys resolved to use\r\nthese to wreak the camp’s displeasure on the Galvanized. The plan was\r\ncarried out capitally. The big darky, followed by a crowd of smaller\r\nand nimbler “shades,” would approach one of the leaders among them with:\r\n\r\n“Is you a Galvanized?”\r\n\r\nThe surly reply would be,\r\n\r\n“Yes, you ---- black ----. What the business is that of yours?”\r\n\r\nAt that instant the bony fist of the darky, descending like a\r\npile-driver, would catch the recreant under the ear, and lift him about\r\na rod. As he fell, the smaller darkies would pounce upon him, and in an\r\ninstant despoil him of his blanket and perhaps the larger portion of\r\nhis warm clothing. The operation was repeated with a dozen or more. The\r\nwhole camp enjoyed it as rare fun, and it was the only time that I saw\r\nnearly every body at Florence laugh.\r\n\r\nA few prisoners were brought in in December, who had been taken\r\nin Foster’s attempt to cut the Charleston & Savannah Railroad at\r\nPocataligo. Among them we were astonished to find Charley Hirsch,\r\na member of Company I’s of our battalion. He had had a strange\r\nexperience. He was originally a member of a Texas regiment and was\r\ncaptured at Arkansas Post. He then took the oath of allegiance and\r\nenlisted with us. While we were at Savannah he approached a guard one\r\nday to trade for tobacco. The moment he spoke to the man he recognized\r\nhim as a former comrade in the Texas regiment. The latter knew him\r\nalso, and sang out,\r\n\r\n“I know you; you’re Charley Hirsch, that used to be in my company.”\r\n\r\nCharley backed into the crowd as quickly as possible; to elude the\r\nfellow’s eyes, but the latter called for the Corporal of the Guard,\r\nhad himself relieved, and in a few minutes came in with an officer\r\nin search of the deserter. He found him with little difficulty, and\r\ntook him out. The luckless Charley was tried by court martial, found,\r\nguilty, sentenced to be shot, and while waiting execution was confined\r\nin the jail. Before the sentence could be carried into effect Sherman\r\ncame so close to the City that it was thought best to remove the\r\nprisoners. In the confusion Charley managed to make his escape, and\r\nat the moment the battle of Pocataligo opened, was lying concealed\r\nbetween the two lines of battle, without knowing, of course, that he\r\nwas in such a dangerous locality. After the firing opened, he thought\r\nit better to lie still than run the risk from the fire of both sides,\r\nespecially as he momentarily expected our folks to advance and drive\r\nthe Rebels away. But the reverse happened; the Johnnies drove our\r\nfellows, and, finding Charley in his place of concealment, took him for\r\none of Foster’s men, and sent him to Florence, where he staid until we\r\nwent through to our lines.\r\n\r\nOur days went by as stupidly and eventless as can be conceived. We had\r\ngrown too spiritless and lethargic to dig tunnels or plan escapes. We\r\nhad nothing to read, nothing to make or destroy, nothing to work with,\r\nnothing to play with, and even no desire to contrive anything for\r\namusement. All the cards in the prison were worn out long ago. Some of\r\nthe boys had made dominos from bones, and Andrews and I still had our\r\nchessmen, but we were too listless to play. The mind, enfeebled by the\r\nlong disuse of it except in a few limited channels, was unfitted for\r\neven so much effort as was involved in a game for pastime.\r\n\r\nNor were there any physical exercises, such as that crowd of young\r\nmen would have delighted in under other circumstances. There was no\r\nrunning, boxing, jumping, wrestling, leaping, etc. All were too weak\r\nand hungry to make any exertion beyond that absolutely necessary.\r\nOn cold days everybody seemed totally benumbed. The camp would be\r\nsilent and still. Little groups everywhere hovered for hours, moody\r\nand sullen, over diminutive, flickering fires, made with one poor\r\nhandful of splinters. When the sun shone, more activity was visible.\r\nBoys wandered around, hunted up their friends, and saw what gaps\r\ndeath--always busiest during the cold spells--had made in the ranks\r\nof their acquaintances. During the warmest part of the day everybody\r\ndisrobed, and spent an hour or more killing the lice that had waxed and\r\nmultiplied to grievous proportions during the few days of comparative\r\nimmunity.\r\n\r\nBesides the whipping of the Galvanized by the darkies, I remember but\r\ntwo other bits of amusement we had while at Florence. One of these was\r\nin hearing the colored soldiers sing patriotic songs, which they did\r\nwith great gusto when the weather became mild. The other was the antics\r\nof a circus clown--a member, I believe, of a Connecticut or a New York\r\nregiment, who, on the rare occasions when we were feeling not exactly\r\nwell so much as simply better than we had been, would give us an hour\r\nor two of recitations of the drolleries with which he was wont to set\r\nthe crowded canvas in a roar. One of his happiest efforts, I remember,\r\nwas a stilted paraphrase of “Old Uncle Ned” a song very popular a\r\nquarter of a century ago, and which ran something like this:\r\n\r\nThere was an old darky, an’ his name was Uncle Ned,\r\nBut he died long ago, long ago\r\nHe had no wool on de top of his head,\r\nDe place whar de wool ought to grouw.\r\n\r\n          CHORUS\r\n          Den lay down de shubel an’ de hoe,\r\n          Den hang up de fiddle an’ de bow;\r\n          For dere’s no more hard work for poor Uncle Ned\r\n          He’s gone whar de good niggahs go.\r\n\r\nHis fingers war long, like de cane in de brake,\r\nAnd his eyes war too dim for to see;\r\nHe had no teeth to eat de corn cake,\r\nSo he had to let de corn cake be.\r\n\r\n          CHORUS.\r\n\r\nHis legs were so bowed dat he couldn’t lie still.\r\nAn’ he had no nails on his toes;\r\n\r\nHis neck was so crooked dot he couldn’t take a pill,\r\nSo he had to take a pill through his nose.\r\n\r\n          CHORUS.\r\n\r\nOne cold frosty morning old Uncle Ned died,\r\nAn’ de tears ran down massa’s cheek like rain,\r\nFor he knew when Uncle Ned was laid in de groun’,\r\nHe would never see poor Uncle Ned again,\r\n\r\n          CHORUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the hands of this artist the song became--\r\n\r\nThere was an aged and indigent African whose cognomen was Uncle Edward,\r\nBut he is deceased since a remote period, a very remote period;\r\nHe possessed no capillary substance on the summit of his cranium,\r\nThe place designated by kind Nature for the capillary substance to\r\nvegetate.\r\n\r\nCHORUS.\r\nThen let the agricultural implements rest recumbent upon the ground;\r\nAnd suspend the musical instruments in peace neon the wall,\r\nFor there’s no more physical energy to be displayed by our Indigent\r\n          Uncle Edward\r\nHe has departed to that place set apart by a beneficent Providence for\r\n          the reception of the better class of Africans.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so on. These rare flashes of fun only served to throw the\r\nunderlying misery out in greater relief. It was like lightning playing\r\nacross the surface of a dreary morass.\r\n\r\nI have before alluded several times to the general inability of Rebels\r\nto count accurately, even in low numbers. One continually met phases\r\nof this that seemed simply incomprehensible to us, who had taken in\r\nthe multiplication table almost with our mother’s milk, and knew the\r\nRule of Three as well as a Presbyterian boy does the Shorter Catechism.\r\nA cadet--an undergraduate of the South Carolina Military Institute\r\n--called our roll at Florence, and though an inborn young aristocrat,\r\nwho believed himself made of finer clay than most mortals, he was\r\nnot a bad fellow at all. He thought South Carolina aristocracy the\r\nfinest gentry, and the South Carolina Military Institute the greatest\r\ninstitution of learning in the world; but that is common with all South\r\nCarolinians.\r\n\r\nOne day he came in so full of some matter of rare importance that we\r\nbecame somewhat excited as to its nature. Dismissing our hundred after\r\nroll-call, he unburdened his mind:\r\n\r\n“Now you fellers are all so d---d peart on mathematics, and such\r\nthings, that you want to snap me up on every opportunity, but I guess\r\nI’ve got something this time that’ll settle you. Its something that a\r\nfellow gave out yesterday, and Colonel Iverson, and all the officers\r\nout there have been figuring on it ever since, and none have got the\r\nright answer, and I’m powerful sure that none of you, smart as you\r\nthink you are, can do it.”\r\n\r\n“Heavens, and earth, let’s hear this wonderful problem,” said we all.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he, “what is the length of a pole standing in a river,\r\none-fifth of which is in the mud, two-thirds in the water, and\r\none-eighth above the water, while one foot and three inches of the top\r\nis broken off?”\r\n\r\nIn a minute a dozen answered, “One hundred and fifty feet.”\r\n\r\nThe cadet could only look his amazement at the possession of such an\r\namount of learning by a crowd of mudsills, and one of our fellows said\r\ncontemptuously:\r\n\r\n“Why, if you South Carolina Institute fellows couldn’t answer such\r\nquestions as that they wouldn’t allow you in the infant class up North.”\r\n\r\nLieutenant Barrett, our red-headed tormentor, could not, for the life\r\nof him, count those inside in hundreds and thousands in such a manner\r\nas to be reasonably certain of correctness. As it would have cankered\r\nhis soul to feel that he was being beaten out of a half-dozen rations\r\nby the superior cunning of the Yankees, he adopted a plan which he must\r\nhave learned at some period of his life when he was a hog or sheep\r\ndrover. Every Sunday morning all in the camp were driven across the\r\nCreek to the East Side, and then made to file slowly back--one at a\r\ntime--between two guards stationed on the little bridge that spanned\r\nthe Creek. By this means, if he was able to count up to one hundred, he\r\ncould get our number correctly.\r\n\r\nThe first time this was done after our arrival he gave us a display\r\nof his wanton malevolence. We were nearly all assembled on the East\r\nSide, and were standing in ranks, at the edge of the swamp, facing the\r\nwest. Barrett was walking along the opposite edge of the swamp, and,\r\ncoming to a little gully jumped, it. He was very awkward, and came near\r\nfalling into the mud. We all yelled derisively. He turned toward us in\r\na fury, shook his fist, and shouted curses and imprecations. We yelled\r\nstill louder. He snatched out his revolver, and began firing at our\r\nline. The distance was considerable--say four or five hundred feet--and\r\nthe bullets struck in the mud in advance of the line. We still yelled.\r\nThen he jerked a gun from a guard and fired, but his aim was still bad,\r\nand the bullet sang over our heads, striking in the bank above us. He\r\nposted of to get another gun, but his fit subsided before he obtained\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIII.\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS--AND THE WAY THE WAS PASSED--THE DAILY ROUTINE OF RATION\r\nDRAWING--SOME PECULIARITIES OF LIVING AND DYING.\r\n\r\nChristmas, with its swelling flood of happy memories,--memories now\r\nbitter because they marked the high tide whence our fortunes had\r\nreceded to this despicable state--came, but brought no change to\r\nmark its coming. It is true that we had expected no change; we had\r\nnot looked forward to the day, and hardly knew when it arrived, so\r\nindifferent were we to the lapse of time.\r\n\r\nWhen reminded that the day was one that in all Christendom was sacred\r\nto good cheer and joyful meetings; that wherever the upraised cross\r\nproclaimed followers of Him who preached “Peace on Earth and good will\r\nto men,” parents and children, brothers and sisters, long-time friends,\r\nand all congenial spirits were gathering around hospitable boards to\r\ndelight in each other’s society, and strengthen the bonds of unity\r\nbetween them, we listened as to a tale told of some foreign land from\r\nwhich we had parted forever more.\r\n\r\nIt seemed years since we had known anything of the kind. The experience\r\nwe had had of it belonged to the dim and irrevocable past. It could not\r\ncome to us again, nor we go to it. Squalor, hunger, cold and wasting\r\ndisease had become the ordinary conditions of existence, from which\r\nthere was little hope that we would ever be exempt.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was well, to a certain degree, that we felt so. It softened\r\nthe poignancy of our reflections over the difference in the condition\r\nof ourselves and our happier comrades who were elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe weather was in harmony with our feelings. The dull, gray, leaden\r\nsky was as sharp a contrast with the crisp, bracing sharpness of a\r\nNorthern Christmas morning, as our beggarly little ration of saltless\r\ncorn meal was to the sumptuous cheer that loaded the dinner-tables of\r\nour Northern homes.\r\n\r\nWe turned out languidly in the morning to roll-call, endured silently\r\nthe raving abuse of the cowardly brute Barrett, hung stupidly over the\r\nflickering little fires, until the gates opened to admit the rations.\r\nFor an hour there was bustle and animation. All stood around and\r\ncounted each sack of meal, to get an idea of the rations we were likely\r\nto receive.\r\n\r\nThis was a daily custom. The number intended for the day’s issue were\r\nall brought in and piled up in the street. Then there was a division\r\nof the sacks to the thousands, the Sergeant of each being called up in\r\nturn, and allowed to pick out and carry away one, until all were taken.\r\nWhen we entered the prison each thousand received, on an average, ten\r\nor eleven sacks a day. Every week saw a reduction in the number, until\r\nby midwinter the daily issue to a thousand averaged four sacks. Let\r\nus say that one of these sacks held two bushels, or the four, eight\r\nbushels. As there are thirty-two quarts in a bushel, one thousand men\r\nreceived two hundred and fifty-six quarts, or less than a half pint\r\neach.\r\n\r\nWe thought we had sounded the depths of misery at Andersonville, but\r\nFlorence showed us a much lower depth. Bad as was parching under the\r\nburning sun whose fiery rays bred miasma and putrefaction, it was still\r\nnot so bad as having one’s life chilled out by exposure in nakedness\r\nupon the frozen ground to biting winds and freezing sleet. Wretched as\r\nthe rusty bacon and coarse, maggot-filled bread of Andersonville was,\r\nit would still go much farther towards supporting life than the handful\r\nof saltless meal at Florence.\r\n\r\nWhile I believe it possible for any young man, with the forces of life\r\nstrong within him, and healthy in every way, to survive, by taking due\r\nprecautions, such treatment as we received in Andersonville, I cannot\r\nunderstand how anybody could live through a month of Florence. That\r\nmany did live is only an astonishing illustration of the tenacity of\r\nlife in some individuals.\r\n\r\nLet the reader imagine--anywhere he likes--a fifteen-acre field, with\r\na stream running through the center. Let him imagine this inclosed\r\nby a Stockade eighteen feet high, made by standing logs on end.\r\nLet him conceive of ten thousand feeble men, debilitated by months\r\nof imprisonment, turned inside this inclosure, without a yard of\r\ncovering given them, and told to make their homes there. One quarter\r\nof them--two thousand five hundred--pick up brush, pieces of rail,\r\nsplits from logs, etc., sufficient to make huts that will turn the rain\r\ntolerably. The huts are in no case as good shelter as an ordinarily\r\ncareful farmer provides for his swine. Half of the prisoners--five\r\nthousand--who cannot do so well, work the mud up into rude bricks,\r\nwith which they build shelters that wash down at every hard rain.\r\nThe remaining two thousand five hundred do not do even this, but lie\r\naround on the ground, on old blankets and overcoats, and in day-time\r\nprop these up on sticks, as shelter from the rain and wind. Let them\r\nbe given not to exceed a pint of corn meal a day, and a piece of wood\r\nabout the size of an ordinary stick for a cooking stove to cook it\r\nwith. Then let such weather prevail as we ordinarily have in the North\r\nin November--freezing cold rains, with frequent days and nights when\r\nthe ice forms as thick as a pane of glass. How long does he think men\r\ncould live through that? He will probably say that a week, or at most\r\na fortnight, would see the last and strongest of these ten thousand\r\nlying dead in the frozen mire where he wallowed. He will be astonished\r\nto learn that probably not more than four or five thousand of those who\r\nunderwent this in Florence died there. How many died after release--in\r\nWashington, on the vessels coming to Annapolis, in hospital and camp at\r\nAnnapolis, or after they reached home, none but the Recording Angel can\r\ntell. All that I know is we left a trail of dead behind us, wherever we\r\nmoved, so long as I was with the doleful caravan.\r\n\r\nLooking back, after these lapse of years, the most salient\r\ncharacteristic seems to be the ease with which men died. There, was\r\nlittle of the violence of dissolution so common at Andersonville. The\r\nmachinery of life in all of us, was running slowly and feebly; it would\r\nsimply grow still slower and feebler in some, and then stop without a\r\njar, without a sensation to manifest it. Nightly one of two or three\r\ncomrades sleeping together would die. The survivors would not know it\r\nuntil they tried to get him to “spoon” over, when they would find him\r\nrigid and motionless. As they could not spare even so little heat as\r\nwas still contained in his body, they would not remove this, but lie up\r\nthe closer to it until morning. Such a thing as a boy making an outcry\r\nwhen he discovered his comrade dead, or manifesting any, desire to get\r\naway from the corpse, was unknown.\r\n\r\nI remember one who, as Charles II. said of himself, was --“an\r\nunconscionable long time in dying.” His name was Bickford; he belonged\r\nto the Twenty-First Ohio Volunteer Infantry, lived, I think, near\r\nFindlay, O., and was in my hundred. His partner and he were both in a\r\nvery bad condition, and I was not surprised, on making my rounds, one\r\nmorning, to find them apparently quite dead. I called help, and took\r\nhis partner away to the gate. When we picked up Bickford we found he\r\nstill lived, and had strength enough to gasp out:\r\n\r\n“You fellers had better let me alone.” We laid him back to die, as we\r\nsupposed, in an hour or so.\r\n\r\nWhen the Rebel Surgeon came in on his rounds, I showed him Bickford,\r\nlying there with his eyes closed, and limbs motionless. The Surgeon\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“O, that man’s dead; why don’t you have him taken out?”\r\n\r\nI replied: “No, he isn’t. Just see.” Stooping, I shook the boy sharply,\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n“Bickford! Bickford!! How do you feel?”\r\n\r\nThe eyes did not unclose, but the lips opened slowly, and said with a\r\npainful effort:\r\n\r\n“F-i-r-s-t R-a-t-e!”\r\n\r\nThis scene was repeated every morning for over a week. Every day the\r\nRebel Surgeon would insist that the man should betaken out, and every\r\nmorning Bickford would gasp out with troublesome exertion that he felt:\r\n\r\n“F-i-r-s-t R-a-t-e!”\r\n\r\nIt ended one morning by his inability, to make his usual answer, and\r\nthen he was carried out to join the two score others being loaded into\r\nthe wagon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIV.\r\n\r\nNEW YEAR’S DAY--DEATH OF JOHN H. WINDER--HE DIES ON HIS WAY TO A DINNER\r\n--SOMETHING AS TO CHARACTER AND CAREER--ONE OF THE WORST MEN THAT EVER\r\nLIVED.\r\n\r\nOn New Year’s Day we were startled by the information that our old-time\r\nenemy--General John H. Winder--was dead. It seemed that the Rebel\r\nSutler of the Post had prepared in his tent a grand New Year’s dinner\r\nto which all the officers were invited. Just as Winder bent his head\r\nto enter the tent he fell, and expired shortly after. The boys said it\r\nwas a clear case of Death by Visitation of the Devil, and it was always\r\ninsisted that his last words were:\r\n\r\n“My faith is in Christ; I expect to be saved. Be sure and cut down the\r\nprisoners’ rations.”\r\n\r\nThus passed away the chief evil genius of the Prisoners-of-War.\r\nAmerican history has no other character approaching his in vileness.\r\nI doubt if the history of the world can show another man, so\r\ninsignificant in abilities and position, at whose door can be laid such\r\na terrible load of human misery. There have been many great conquerors\r\nand warriors who have\r\n\r\n          Waded through slaughter to a throne,\r\n          And shut the gates of mercy on mankind,\r\n\r\nbut they were great men, with great objects, with grand plans to carry\r\nout, whose benefits they thought would be more than an equivalent for\r\nthe suffering they caused. The misery they inflicted was not the motive\r\nof their schemes, but an unpleasant incident, and usually the sufferers\r\nwere men of other races and religions, for whom sympathy had been\r\ndulled by long antagonism.\r\n\r\nBut Winder was an obscure, dull old man--the commonplace descendant of\r\na pseudo-aristocrat whose cowardly incompetence had once cost us the\r\nloss of our National Capital. More prudent than his runaway father, he\r\nheld himself aloof from the field; his father had lost reputation and\r\nalmost his commission, by coming into contact with the enemy; he would\r\ntake no such foolish risks, and he did not. When false expectations\r\nof the ultimate triumph of Secession led him to cast his lot with the\r\nSouthern Confederacy, he did not solicit a command in the field, but\r\ntook up his quarters in Richmond, to become a sort of Informer-General,\r\nHigh-Inquisitor and Chief Eavesdropper for his intimate friend,\r\nJefferson Davis. He pried and spied around into every man’s bedroom and\r\nfamily circle, to discover traces of Union sentiment. The wildest tales\r\nmalice and vindictiveness could concoct found welcome reception in his\r\nears. He was only too willing to believe, that he might find excuse for\r\nharrying and persecuting. He arrested, insulted, imprisoned, banished,\r\nand shot people, until the patience even of the citizens of Richmond\r\ngave way, and pressure was brought upon Jefferson Davis to secure the\r\nsuppression of his satellite. For a long while Davis resisted, but\r\nat last yielded, and transferred Winder to the office of Commissary\r\nGeneral of Prisoners. The delight of the Richmond people was great. One\r\nof the papers expressed it in an article, the key note of which was:\r\n\r\n“Thank God that Richmond is at last rid of old Winder. God have mercy\r\nupon those to whom he has been sent.”\r\n\r\nRemorseless and cruel as his conduct of the office of Provost Marshal\r\nGeneral was, it gave little hint of the extent to which he would go\r\nin that of Commissary General of Prisoners. Before, he was restrained\r\nsomewhat by public opinion and the laws of the land. These no longer\r\ndeterred him. From the time he assumed command of all the Prisons east\r\nof the Mississippi--some time in the Fall of 1863--until death removed\r\nhim, January 1, 1865--certainly not less than twenty-five thousand\r\nincarcerated men died in the most horrible manner that the mind can\r\nconceive. He cannot be accused of exaggeration, when, surveying the\r\nthousands of new graves at Andersonville, he could say with a quiet\r\nchuckle that he was “doing more to kill off the Yankees than twenty\r\nregiments at the front.” No twenty regiments in the Rebel Army ever\r\nsucceeded in slaying anything like thirteen thousand Yankees in six\r\nmonths, or any other time. His cold blooded cruelty was such as to\r\ndisgust even the Rebel officers. Colonel D. T. Chandler, of the Rebel\r\nWar Department, sent on a tour of inspection to Andersonville, reported\r\nback, under date of August 5, 1864:\r\n\r\n“My duty requires me respectfully to recommend a change in the officer\r\nin command of the post, Brigadier General John H. Winder, and the\r\nsubstitution in his place of some one who unites both energy and good\r\njudgment with some feelings of humanity and consideration for the\r\nwelfare and comfort, as far as is consistent with their safe keeping,\r\nof the vast number of unfortunates placed under his control; some one\r\nwho, at least, will not advocate deliberately, and in cold blood, the\r\npropriety of leaving them in their present condition until their number\r\nis sufficiently reduced by death to make the present arrangements\r\nsuffice for their accommodation, and who will not consider it a matter\r\nof self-laudation and boasting that he has never been inside of the\r\nStockade--a place the horrors of which it is difficult to describe, and\r\nwhich is a disgrace to civilization--the condition of which he might,\r\nby the exercise of a little energy and judgment, even with the limited\r\nmeans at his command, have considerably improved.”\r\n\r\nIn his examination touching this report, Colonel Chandler says:\r\n\r\n“I noticed that General Winder seemed very indifferent to the welfare\r\nof the prisoners, indisposed to do anything, or to do as much as I\r\nthought he ought to do, to alleviate their sufferings. I remonstrated\r\nwith him as well as I could, and he used that language which I\r\nreported to the Department with reference to it--the language stated\r\nin the report. When I spoke of the great mortality existing among the\r\nprisoners, and pointed out to him that the sickly season was coming on,\r\nand that it must necessarily increase unless something was done for\r\ntheir relief--the swamp, for instance, drained, proper food furnished,\r\nand in better quantity, and other sanitary suggestions which I made to\r\nhim--he replied to me that he thought it was better to see half of them\r\ndie than to take care of the men.”\r\n\r\nIt was he who could issue such an order as this, when it was supposed\r\nthat General Stoneman was approaching Andersonville:\r\n\r\n                                   HEADQUARTERS MILITARY PRISON,\r\n                                   ANDERSONVILLE, Ga., July 27, 1864.\r\nThe officers on duty and in charge of the Battery of Florida Artillery\r\nat the time will, upon receiving notice that the enemy has approached\r\nwithin seven miles of this post, open upon the Stockade with grapeshot,\r\nwithout reference to the situation beyond these lines of defense.\r\n\r\n                                   JOHN H. WINDER,\r\n                              Brigadier General Commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis man was not only unpunished, but the Government is to-day\r\nsupporting his children in luxury by the rent it pays for the use of\r\nhis property --the well-known Winder building, which is occupied by one\r\nof the Departments at Washington.\r\n\r\nI confess that all my attempts to satisfactorily analyze Winder’s\r\ncharacter and discover a sufficient motive for his monstrous conduct\r\nhave been futile. Even if we imagine him inspired by a hatred of the\r\npeople of the North that rose to fiendishness, we can not understand\r\nhim. It seems impossible for the mind of any man to cherish so deep and\r\ninsatiable an enmity against his fellow-creatures that it could not be\r\nquenched and turned to pity by the sight of even one day’s misery at\r\nAndersonville or Florence. No one man could possess such a grievous\r\nsense of private or national wrongs as to be proof against the daily\r\nspectacle of thousands of his own fellow citizens, inhabitants of the\r\nsame country, associates in the same institutions, educated in the same\r\nprinciples, speaking the same language--thousands of his brethren in\r\nrace, creed, and all that unite men into great communities, starving,\r\nrotting and freezing to death.\r\n\r\nThere is many a man who has a hatred so intense that nothing but\r\nthe death of the detested one will satisfy it. A still fewer number\r\nthirst for a more comprehensive retribution; they would slay perhaps\r\na half-dozen persons; and there may be such gluttons of revenge as\r\nwould not be satisfied with the sacrifice of less than a score or two,\r\nbut such would be monsters of whom there have been very few, even in\r\nfiction. How must they all bow their diminished heads before a man who\r\nfed his animosity fat with tens of thousands of lives.\r\n\r\nBut, what also militates greatly against the presumption that either\r\nrevenge or an abnormal predisposition to cruelty could have animated\r\nWinder, is that the possession of any two such mental traits so\r\nstrongly marked would presuppose a corresponding activity of other\r\nintellectual faculties, which was not true of him, as from all I can\r\nlearn of him his mind was in no respect extraordinary.\r\n\r\nIt does not seem possible that he had either the brain to conceive, or\r\nthe firmness of purpose to carry out so gigantic and long-enduring a\r\ncareer of cruelty, because that would imply superhuman qualities in a\r\nman who had previously held his own very poorly in the competition with\r\nother men.\r\n\r\nThe probability is that neither Winder nor his direct superiors--Howell\r\nCobb and Jefferson Davis--conceived in all its proportions the gigantic\r\nengine of torture and death they were organizing; nor did they\r\ncomprehend the enormity of the crime they were committing. But they\r\nwere willing to do much wrong to gain their end; and the smaller crimes\r\nof to-day prepared them for greater ones to-morrow, and still greater\r\nones the day following. Killing ten men a day on Belle Isle in January,\r\nby starvation and hardship, led very easily to killing one hundred men\r\na day in Andersonville, in July, August and September. Probably at\r\nthe beginning of the war they would have felt uneasy at slaying one\r\nman per day by such means, but as retribution came not, and as their\r\nappetite for slaughter grew with feeding, and as their sympathy with\r\nhuman misery atrophied from long suppression, they ventured upon ever\r\nwidening ranges of destructiveness. Had the war lasted another year,\r\nand they lived, five hundred deaths a day would doubtless have been\r\ninsufficient to disturb them.\r\n\r\nWinder doubtless went about his part of the task of slaughter coolly,\r\nleisurely, almost perfunctorily. His training in the Regular Army\r\nwas against the likelihood of his displaying zeal in anything. He\r\ninstituted certain measures, and let things take their course. That\r\ncourse was a rapid transition from bad to worse, but it was still in\r\nthe direction of his wishes, and, what little of his own energy was\r\ninfused into it was in the direction of impetus,-not of controlling\r\nor improving the course. To have done things better would have\r\ninvolved soma personal discomfort. He was not likely to incur personal\r\ndiscomfort to mitigate evils that were only afflicting someone else.\r\nBy an effort of one hour a day for two weeks he could have had every\r\nman in Andersonville and Florence given good shelter through his own\r\nexertions. He was not only too indifferent and too lazy to do this,\r\nbut he was too malignant; and this neglect to allow--simply allow,\r\nremember--the prisoners to protect their lives by providing their own\r\nshelter, gives the key to his whole disposition, and would stamp his\r\nmemory with infamy, even if there were no other charges against him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXV.\r\n\r\nONE INSTANCE OF A SUCCESSFUL ESCAPE--THE ADVENTURES OF SERGEANT WALTER\r\nHARTSOUGH, OF COMPANY K, SIXTEENTH ILLINOIS CAVALRY--HE GETS AWAY FROM\r\nTHE REBELS AT THOMASVILLE, AND AFTER A TOILSOME AND DANGEROUS JOURNEY\r\nOF SEVERAL HUNDRED MILES, REACHES OUR LINES IN FLORIDA.\r\n\r\nWhile I was at Savannah I got hold of a primary geography in possession\r\nof one of the prisoners, and securing a fragment of a lead pencil from\r\none comrade, and a sheet of note paper from another, I made a copy of\r\nthe South Carolina and Georgia sea coast, for the use of Andrews and\r\nmyself in attempting to escape. The reader remembers the ill success of\r\nall our efforts in that direction. When we were at Blackshear we still\r\nhad the map, and intended to make another effort, “as soon as the sign\r\ngot right.” One day while we were waiting for this, Walter Hartsough, a\r\nSergeant of Company g, of our battalion, came to me and said:\r\n\r\n“Mc., I wish you’d lend me your map a little while. I want to make a\r\ncopy.”\r\n\r\nI handed it over to him, and never saw him more, as almost immediately\r\nafter we were taken out “on parole” and sent to Florence. I heard from\r\nother comrades of the battalion that he had succeeded in getting past\r\nthe guard line and into the Woods, which was the last they ever heard\r\nof him. Whether starved to death in some swamp, whether torn to pieces\r\nby dogs, or killed by the rifles of his pursuers, they knew not. The\r\nreader can judge of my astonishment as well as pleasure, at receiving\r\namong the dozens of letters which came to me every day while this\r\naccount was appearing in the BLADE, one signed “Walter Hartsough, late\r\nof Co. K, Sixteenth Illinois Cavalry.” It was like one returned from\r\nthe grave, and the next mail took a letter to him, inquiring eagerly\r\nof his adventures after we separated. I take pleasure in presenting\r\nthe reader with his reply, which was only intended as a private\r\ncommunication to myself. The first part of the letter I omit, as it\r\ncontains only gossip about our old comrades, which, however interesting\r\nto myself, would hardly be so to the general reader.\r\n\r\n                                   GENOA, WAYNE COUNTY, IA.,\r\n                                   May 27, 1879.\r\n\r\nDear Comrade Mc.:\r\n                    .....................\r\nI have been living in this town for ten years, running a general\r\nstore, under the firm name of Hartsough & Martin, and have been more\r\nsuccessful than I anticipated.\r\n\r\nI made my escape from Thomasville, Ga., Dec. 7, 1864, by running the\r\nguards, in company with Frank Hommat, of Company M, and a man by the\r\nname of Clipson, of the Twenty-First Illinois Infantry. I had heard\r\nthe officers in charge of us say that they intended to march us across\r\nto the other road, and take us back to Andersonville. We concluded\r\nwe would take a heavy risk on our lives rather than return there. By\r\nstinting ourselves we had got a little meal ahead, which we thought we\r\nwould bake up for the journey, but our appetites got the better of us,\r\nand we ate it all up before starting. We were camped in the woods then,\r\nwith no Stockade--only a line of guards around us. We thought that by\r\na little strategy and boldness we could pass these. We determined to\r\ntry. Clipson was to go to the right, Hommat in the center, and myself\r\nto the left. We all slipped through, without a shot. Our rendezvous was\r\nto be the center of a small swamp, through which flowed a small stream\r\nthat supplied the prisoners with water. Hommat and I got together soon\r\nafter passing the guard lines, and we began signaling for Clipson. We\r\nlaid down by a large log that lay across the stream, and submerged\r\nour limbs and part of our bodies in the water, the better to screen\r\nourselves from observation. Pretty soon a Johnny came along with a\r\nbunch of turnip tops, that he was taking up to the camp to trade to the\r\nprisoners. As he passed over the log I could have caught him by the\r\nleg, which I intended to do if he saw us, but he passed along, heedless\r\nof those concealed under his very feet, which saved him a ducking at\r\nleast, for we were resolved to drown him if he discovered us. Waiting\r\nhere a little longer we left our lurking place and made a circuit of\r\nthe edge of the swamp, still signaling for Clipson. But we could find\r\nnothing of him, and at last had to give him up.\r\n\r\nWe were now between Thomasville and the camp, and as Thomasville\r\nwas the end of the railroad, the woods were full of Rebels waiting\r\ntransportation, and we approached the road carefully, supposing that it\r\nwas guarded to keep their own men from going to town. We crawled up to\r\nthe road, but seeing no one, started across it. At that moment a guard\r\nabout thirty yards to our left, who evidently supposed that we were\r\nRebels, sang out:\r\n\r\n“Whar ye gwine to thar boys?”\r\n\r\nI answered:\r\n\r\n“Jest a-gwine out here a little ways.”\r\n\r\nFrank whispered me to run, but I said, “No; wait till he halts us,\r\nand then run.” He walked up to where we had crossed his beat--looked\r\nafter us a few minutes, and then, to our great relief, walked back to\r\nhis post. After much trouble we succeeded in getting through all the\r\ntroops, and started fairly on our way. We tried to shape our course\r\ntoward Florida. The country was very swampy, the night rainy and dark,\r\nno stars were out to guide us, and we made such poor progress that\r\nwhen daylight came we were only eight miles from our starting place,\r\nand close to a road leading from Thomasville to Monticello. Finding a\r\nlarge turnip patch, we filled our pockets, and then hunted a place to\r\nlie concealed in during the day. We selected a thicket in the center\r\nof a large pasture. We crawled into this and laid down. Some negros\r\npassed close to us, going to their work in an adjoining field. They had\r\na bucket of victuals with them for dinner, which they hung on the fence\r\nin such a way that we could have easily stolen it without detection.\r\nThe temptation to hungry men was very great, but we concluded that it\r\nwas best and safest to let it alone.\r\n\r\nAs the negros returned from work in the evening they separated, one\r\nold man passing on the opposite side of the thicket from the rest. We\r\nhalted him and told him that we were Rebs, who had taken a French leave\r\nof Thomasville; that we were tired of guarding Yanks, and were going\r\nhome; and further, that we were hungry, and wanted something to eat.\r\nHe told us that he was the boss on the plantation. His master lived in\r\nThomasville. He, himself, did not have much to eat, but he would show\r\nus where to stay, and when the folks went to bed he would bring us some\r\nfood. Passing up close to the negro quarters we got over the fence and\r\nlay down behind it, to wait for our supper.\r\n\r\nWe had been there but a short time when a young negro came out, and\r\npassing close by us, went into a fence corner a few panels distant\r\nand, kneeling down, began praying aloud, and very, earnestly, and\r\nstranger still, the burden of his supplication was for the success of\r\nour armies. I thought it the best prayer I ever listened to. Finishing\r\nhis devotions he returned to the house, and shortly after the old man\r\ncame with a good supper of corn bread, molasses and milk. He said that\r\nhe had no meat, and that he had done the best he could for us. After\r\nwe had eaten, he said that as the young people had gone to bed, we had\r\nbetter come into his cabin and rest awhile, which we did.\r\n\r\nHommat had a full suit of Rebel clothes, and I had stolen sacks enough\r\nat Andersonville, when they were issuing rations, to make me a shirt\r\nand pantaloons, which a sailor fabricated for me. I wore these over\r\nwhat was left of my blue clothes. The old negro lady treated us very\r\ncoolly. In a few minutes a young negro came in, whom the old gentleman\r\nintroduced as his son, and whom I immediately recognized as our friend\r\nof the prayerful proclivities. He said that he had been a body servant\r\nto his young master, who was an officer in the Rebel army.\r\n\r\n“Golly!” says he, “if you ’uns had stood a little longer at Stone\r\nRiver, our men would have run.”\r\n\r\nI turned to him sharply with the question of what he meant by calling\r\nus “You ’uns,” and asked him if he believed we were Yankees. He\r\nsurveyed us carefully for a few seconds, and then said:\r\n\r\n“Yes; I bleav you is Yankees.”\r\n\r\nHe paused a second, and added:\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know you is.”\r\n\r\nI asked him how he knew it, and he said that we neither looked nor\r\ntalked like their men. I then acknowledged that we were Yankee\r\nprisoners, trying to make our escape to our lines. This announcement\r\nput new life into the old lady, and, after satisfying herself that we\r\nwere really Yankees, she got up from her seat, shook hands with us,\r\nand declared we must have a better supper than we had had. She set\r\nimmediately about preparing it for us. Taking up a plank in the floor,\r\nshe pulled out a nice flitch of bacon, from which she cut as much as\r\nwe could eat, and gave us some to carry with us. She got up a real\r\nsubstantial supper, to which we did full justice, in spite of the meal\r\nwe had already eaten.\r\n\r\nThey gave us a quantity of victuals to take with us, and instructed us\r\nas well as possible as to our road. They warned us to keep away from\r\nthe young negros, but trust the old ones implicitly. Thanking them\r\nover and over for their exceeding kindness, we bade them good-by, and\r\nstarted again on our journey. Our supplies lasted two days, during\r\nwhich time we made good progress, keeping away from the roads, and\r\nflanking the towns, which were few and insignificant. We occasionally\r\ncame across negros, of whom we cautiously inquired as to the route\r\nand towns, and by the assistance of our map and the stars, got along\r\nvery well indeed, until we came to the Suwanee River. We had intended\r\nto cross this at Columbus or Alligator. When within six miles of the\r\nriver we stopped at some negro huts to get some food. The lady who\r\nowned the negros was a widow, who was born and raised in Massachusetts.\r\nHer husband had died before the war began. An old negro woman told her\r\nmistress that we were at the quarters, and she sent for us to come to\r\nthe house. She was a very nice-looking lady, about thirty-five years\r\nof age, and treated us with great kindness. Hommat being barefooted,\r\nshe pulled off her own shoes and stockings and gave them to him, saying\r\nthat she would go to Town the next day and get herself another pair.\r\nShe told us not to try to cross the river near Columbus, as their\r\ntroops had been deserting in great numbers, and the river was closely\r\npicketed to catch the runaways. She gave us directions how to go so\r\nas to cross the river about fifty miles below Columbus. We struck the\r\nriver again the next night, and I wanted to swim it, but Hommat was\r\nafraid of alligators, and I could not induce him to venture into the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nWe traveled down the river until we came to Moseley’s Ferry, where we\r\nstole an old boat about a third full of water, and paddled across.\r\nThere was quite a little town at that place, but we walked right down\r\nthe main street without meeting any one. Six miles from the river we\r\nsaw an old negro woman roasting sweet potatos in the back yard of a\r\nhouse. We were very hungry, and thought we would risk something to get\r\nfood. Hommat went around near her, and asked her for something to eat.\r\nShe told him to go and ask the white folks. This was the answer she\r\nmade to every question. He wound up by asking her how far it was to\r\nMossley’s Ferry, saying that he wanted to go there, and get something\r\nto eat. She at last ran into the house, and we ran away as fast as\r\nwe could. We had gone but a short distance when we heard a horn, and\r\nsoon-the-cursed hounds began bellowing. We did our best running, but\r\nthe hounds circled around the house a few times and then took our\r\ntrail. For a little while it seemed all up with us, as the sound of the\r\nbaying came closer and closer. But our inquiry about the distance to\r\nMoseley’s Ferry seems to have saved us. They soon called the hounds in,\r\nand started them on the track we had come, instead of that upon which\r\nwe were going. The baying shortly died away in the distance. We did not\r\nwaste any time congratulating ourselves over our marvelous escape, but\r\npaced on as fast as we could for about eight miles farther. On the way\r\nwe passed over the battle ground of Oolustee, or Ocean Pond.\r\n\r\nComing near to Lake City we fell in with some negros who had been\r\nbrought from Maryland. We stopped over one day with them, to rest, and\r\ntwo of them concluded to go with us. We were furnished with a lot of\r\ncooked provisions, and starting one night made forty-two miles before\r\nmorning. We kept the negros in advance. I told Hommat that it was a\r\npoor command that could not afford an advance guard. After traveling\r\ntwo nights with the negros, we came near Baldwin. Here I was very much\r\nafraid of recapture, and I did not want the negros with us, if we were,\r\nlest we should be shot for slave-stealing. About daylight of the second\r\nmorning we gave them the slip.\r\n\r\nWe had to skirt Baldwin closely, to head the St. Mary’s River, or cross\r\nit where that was easiest. After crossing the river we came to a very\r\nlarge swamp, in the edge of which we lay all day. Before nightfall we\r\nstarted to go through it, as there was no fear of detection in these\r\nswamps. We got through before it was very dark, and as we emerged\r\nfrom it we discovered a dense cloud of smoke to our right and quite\r\nclose. We decided this was a camp, and while we were talking the band\r\nbegan to play. This made us think that probably our forces had come\r\nout from Fernandina, and taken the place. I proposed to Hommat that\r\nwe go forward and reconnoiter. He refused, and leaving him alone, I\r\nstarted forward. I had gone but a short distance when a soldier came\r\nout from the camp with a bucket. He began singing, and the song he\r\nsang convinced me that he was a Rebel. Rejoining Hommat, we held a\r\nconsultation and decided to stay where we were until it became darker,\r\nbefore trying to get out. It was the night of the 22d of December, and\r\nvery cold for that country. The camp guard had small fires built, which\r\nwe could see quite plainly. After starting we saw that the pickets also\r\nhad fires, and that we were between the two lines. This discovery saved\r\nus from capture, and keeping about an equal distance between the two,\r\nwe undertook to work our way out.\r\n\r\nWe first crossed a line of breastworks, then in succession the\r\nFernandina Railroad, the Jacksonville Railroad, and pike, moving all\r\nthe time nearly parallel with the picket line. Here we had to halt.\r\nHommat was suffering greatly with his feet. The shoes that had been\r\ngiven him by the widow lady were worn out, and his feet were much torn\r\nand cut by the terribly rough road we had traveled through swamps, etc.\r\nWe sat down on a log, and I, pulling off the remains of my army shirt,\r\ntore it into pieces, and Hommat wrapped his feet up in them. A part I\r\nreserved and tore into strips, to tie up the rents in our pantaloons.\r\nGoing through the swamps and briers had torn them into tatters, from\r\nwaistband to hem, leaving our skins bare to be served in the same way.\r\n\r\nWe started again, moving slowly and bearing towards the picket fires,\r\nwhich we could see for a distance on our left. After traveling some\r\nlittle time the lights on our left ended, which puzzled us for a while,\r\nuntil we came to a fearful big swamp, that explained it all, as this,\r\nconsidered impassable, protected the right of the camp. We had an awful\r\ntime in getting through. In many places we had to lie down and crawl\r\nlong distances through the paths made in the brakes by hogs and other\r\nanimals. As we at length came out, Hommat turned to me and whispered\r\nthat in the morning we would have some Lincoln coffee. He seemed to\r\nthink this must certainly end our troubles.\r\n\r\nWe were now between the Jacksonville Railroad and the St. John’s River.\r\nWe kept about four miles from the railroad, for fear of running into\r\nthe Rebel outposts. We had traveled but a few miles when Hommat said he\r\ncould go no farther, as his feet and legs were so swelled and numb that\r\nhe could not tell when he set them upon the ground. I had some matches\r\nthat a negro had given me, and gathering together a few pine knots\r\nwe made a fire--the first that we had lighted on the trip--and laid\r\ndown with it between us. We had slept but a few minutes when I awoke\r\nand found Hommat’s clothes on fire. Rousing him we put out the flames\r\nbefore he was badly burned, but the thing had excited him so as to give\r\nhim new life, and be proposed to start on again.\r\n\r\nBy sunrise we were within eight miles of our lines, and concluding that\r\nit would be safe to travel in the daytime, we went ahead, walking along\r\nthe railroad. The excitement being over, Hommat began to move very\r\nslowly again. His feet and legs were so swollen that he could scarcely\r\nwalk, and it took us a long while to pass over those eight miles.\r\n\r\nAt last we came in sight of our pickets. They were negros. They halted\r\nus, and Hommat went forward to speak to them. They called for the\r\nOfficer of the Guard, who came, passed us inside, and shook hands\r\ncordially with us. His first inquiry was if we knew Charley Marseilles,\r\nwhom you remember ran that little bakery at Andersonville.\r\n\r\nWe were treated very kindly at Jacksonville. General Scammon was in\r\ncommand of the post, and had only been released but a short time from\r\nprison, so he knew how it was himself. I never expect to enjoy as happy\r\na moment on earth as I did when I again got under the protection of the\r\nold flag. Hommat went to the hospital a few days, and was then sent\r\naround to New York by sea.\r\n\r\nOh, it was a fearful trip through those Florida swamps. We would very\r\noften have to try a swamp in three or four different places before\r\nwe could get through. Some nights we could not travel on account\r\nof its being cloudy and raining. There is not money enough in the\r\nUnited States to induce me to undertake the trip again under the same\r\ncircumstances. Our friend Clipson, that made his escape when we did,\r\ngot very nearly through to our lines, but was taken sick, and had to\r\ngive himself up. He was taken back to Andersonville and kept until the\r\nnext Spring, when he came through all right. There were sixty-one of\r\nCompany K captured at Jonesville, and I think there was only seventeen\r\nlived through those horrible prisons.\r\n\r\nYou have given the best description of prison life that I have ever\r\nseen written. The only trouble is that it cannot be portrayed so that\r\npersons can realize the suffering and abuse that our soldiers endured\r\nin those prison hells. Your statements are all correct in regard to\r\nthe treatment that we received, and all those scenes you have depicted\r\nare as vivid in my mind today as if they had only occurred yesterday.\r\nPlease let me hear from you again. Wishing you success in all your\r\nundertakings, I remain your friend,\r\n\r\n                              WALTER, HARTSOUGH,\r\n          Late of K Company, Sixteenth Illinois Volunteer of Infantry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE PECULIAR TYPE OF INSANITY PREVALENT AT FLORENCE--BARRETT’S\r\nWANTONNESS OF CRUELTY--WE LEARN OF SHERMAN’S ADVANCE INTO SOUTH\r\nCAROLINA--THE REBELS BEGIN MOVING THE PRISONERS AWAY--ANDREWS AND I\r\nCHANGE OUR TACTICS, AND STAY BEHIND--ARRIVAL OF FIVE PRISONERS FROM\r\nSHERMAN’S COMMAND--THEIR UNBOUNDED CONFIDENCE IN SHERMAN’S SUCCESS, AND\r\nITS BENEFICIAL EFFECT UPON US.\r\n\r\nOne terrible phase of existence at Florence was the vast increase of\r\ninsanity. We had many insane men at Andersonville, but the type of the\r\nderangement was different, partaking more of what the doctors term\r\nmelancholia. Prisoners coming in from the front were struck aghast by\r\nthe horrors they saw everywhere. Men dying of painful and repulsive\r\ndiseases lined every step of whatever path they trod; the rations given\r\nthem were repugnant to taste and stomach; shelter from the fiery sun\r\nthere was none, and scarcely room enough for them to lie down upon.\r\nUnder these discouraging circumstances, home-loving, kindly-hearted\r\nmen, especially those who had passed out of the first flush of youth,\r\nand had left wife and children behind when they entered the service,\r\nwere speedily overcome with despair of surviving until released; their\r\nhopelessness fed on the same germs which gave it birth, until it became\r\nsenseless, vacant-eyed, unreasoning, incurable melancholy, when the\r\nvictim would lie for hours, without speaking a word, except to babble\r\nof home, or would wander aimlessly about the camp--frequently stark\r\nnaked--until he died or was shot for coming too near the Dead Line.\r\nSoldiers must not suppose that this was the same class of weaklings\r\nwho usually pine themselves into the Hospital within three months\r\nafter their regiment enters the field. They were as a rule, made up of\r\nseasoned soldiery, who had become inured to the dangers and hardships\r\nof active service, and were not likely to sink down under any ordinary\r\ntrials.\r\n\r\nThe insane of Florence were of a different class; they were the boys\r\nwho had laughed at such a yielding to adversity in Andersonville,\r\nand felt a lofty pity for the misfortunes of those who succumbed so.\r\nBut now the long strain of hardship, privation and exposure had done\r\nfor them what discouragement had done for those of less fortitude in\r\nAndersonville. The faculties shrank under disuse and misfortune, until\r\nthey forgot their regiments, companies, places and date of capture,\r\nand finally, even their names. I should think that by the middle of\r\nJanuary, at least one in every ten had sunk to this imbecile condition.\r\nIt was not insanity so much as mental atrophy--not so much aberration\r\nof the mind, as a paralysis of mental action. The sufferers became\r\napathetic idiots, with no desire or wish to do or be anything. If they\r\nwalked around at all they had to be watched closely, to prevent their\r\nstraying over the Dead Line, and giving the young brats of guards the\r\ncoveted opportunity of killing them. Very many of such were killed,\r\nand one of my Midwinter memories of Florence was that of seeing one of\r\nthese unfortunate imbeciles wandering witlessly up to the Dead Line\r\nfrom the Swamp, while the guard--a boy of seventeen--stood with gun in\r\nhand, in the attitude of a man expecting a covey to be flushed, waiting\r\nfor the poor devil to come so near the Dead Line as to afford an excuse\r\nfor killing him. Two sane prisoners, comprehending the situation,\r\nrushed up to the lunatic, at the risk of their own lives, caught him by\r\nthe arms, and drew him back to safety.\r\n\r\nThe brutal Barrett seemed to delight in maltreating these demented\r\nunfortunates. He either could not be made to understand their\r\ncondition, or willfully disregarded it, for it was one of the commonest\r\nsights to see him knock down, beat, kick or otherwise abuse them\r\nfor not instantly obeying orders which their dazed senses could not\r\ncomprehend, or their feeble limbs execute, even if comprehended.\r\n\r\nIn my life I have seen many wantonly cruel men. I have known numbers\r\nof mates of Mississippi river steamers--a class which seems carefully\r\nselected from ruffians most proficient in profanity, obscenity and\r\nswift-handed violence; I have seen negro-drivers in the slave marts of\r\nSt. Louis, Memphis and New Orleans, and overseers on the plantations\r\nof Mississippi and Louisiana; as a police reporter in one of the\r\nlargest cities in America, I have come in contact with thousands of\r\nthe brutalized scoundrels--the thugs of the brothel, bar-room and\r\nalley--who form the dangerous classes of a metropolis. I knew Captain\r\nWirz. But in all this exceptionally extensive and varied experience, I\r\nnever met a man who seemed to love cruelty for its own sake as well as\r\nLieutenant Barrett. He took such pleasure in inflicting pain as those\r\nIndians who slice off their prisoners’ eyelids, ears, noses and hands,\r\nbefore burning them at the stake.\r\n\r\nThat a thing hurt some one else was always ample reason for his doing\r\nit. The starving, freezing prisoners used to collect in considerable\r\nnumbers before the gate, and stand there for hours gazing vacantly\r\nat it. There was no special object in doing this, only that it was a\r\ncentral point, the rations came in there, and occasionally an officer\r\nwould enter, and it was the only place where anything was likely to\r\noccur to vary the dreary monotony of the day, and the boys went there\r\nbecause there was nothing else to offer any occupation to their minds.\r\nIt became a favorite practical joke of Barrett’s to slip up to the gate\r\nwith an armful of clubs, and suddenly opening the wicket, fling them\r\none after another, into the crowd, with all the force he possessed.\r\nMany were knocked down, and many received hurts which resulted in fatal\r\ngangrene. If he had left the clubs lying where thrown, there would have\r\nbeen some compensation for his meanness, but he always came in and\r\ncarefully gathered up such as he could get, as ammunition for another\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nI have heard men speak of receiving justice--even favors from Wirz. I\r\nnever heard any one saying that much of Barrett. Like Winder, if he had\r\na redeeming quality it was carefully obscured from the view of all that\r\nI ever met who knew him.\r\n\r\nWhere the fellow came from, what State was entitled to the discredit of\r\nproducing and raising him, what he was before the War, what became of\r\nhim after he left us, are matters of which I never heard even a rumor,\r\nexcept a very vague one that he had been killed by our cavalry, some\r\nreturned prisoner having recognized and shot him.\r\n\r\nColonel Iverson, of the Fifth Georgia, was the Post Commander. He was a\r\nman of some education, but had a violent, ungovernable temper, during\r\nfits of which he did very brutal things. At other times he would show\r\na disposition towards fairness and justice. The worst point in my\r\nindictment against him is that he suffered Barrett to do as he did.\r\n\r\nLet the reader understand that I have no personal reasons for my\r\nopinion of these men. They never did anything to me, save what they did\r\nto all of my companions. I held myself aloof from them, and shunned\r\nintercourse so effectually that during my whole imprisonment I did not\r\nspeak as many words to Rebel officers as are in this and the above\r\nparagraphs, and most of those were spoken to the Surgeon who visited\r\nmy hundred. I do not usually seek conversation with people I do not\r\nlike, and certainly did not with persons for whom I had so little love\r\nas I had for Turner, Ross, Winder, Wirz, Davis, Iverson, Barrett, et\r\nal. Possibly they felt badly over my distance and reserve, but I must\r\nconfess that they never showed it very palpably.\r\n\r\nAs January dragged slowly away into February, rumors of the astonishing\r\nsuccess of Sherman began to be so definite and well authenticated as to\r\ninduce belief. We knew that the Western Chieftain had marched almost\r\nunresisted through Georgia, and captured Savannah with comparatively\r\nlittle difficulty. We did not understand it, nor did the Rebels around\r\nus, for neither of us comprehended the Confederacy’s near approach to\r\ndissolution, and we could not explain why a desperate attempt was not\r\nmade somewhere to arrest the onward sweep of the conquering armies of\r\nthe West. It seemed that if there was any vitality left in Rebeldom it\r\nwould deal a blow that would at least cause the presumptuous invader\r\nto pause. As we knew nothing of the battles of Franklin and Nashville,\r\nwe were ignorant of the destruction of Hood’s army, and were at a loss\r\nto account for its failure to contest Sherman’s progress. The last we\r\nhad heard of Hood, he had been flanked out of Atlanta, but we did not\r\nunderstand that the strength or morale of his force had been seriously\r\nreduced in consequence.\r\n\r\nSoon it drifted in to us that Sherman had cut loose from Savannah, as\r\nfrom Atlanta, and entered South Carolina, to repeat there the march\r\nthrough her sister State. Our sources of information now were confined\r\nto the gossip which our men--working outside on parole,--could overhear\r\nfrom the Rebels, and communicate to us as occasion served. These\r\noccasions were not frequent, as the men outside were not allowed to\r\ncome in except rarely, or stay long then. Still we managed to know\r\nreasonably, soon that Sherman was sweeping resistlessly across the\r\nState, with Hardee, Dick Taylor, Beauregard, and others, vainly trying\r\nto make head against him. It seemed impossible to us that they should\r\nnot stop him soon, for if each of all these leaders had any command\r\nworthy the name the aggregate must make an army that, standing on the\r\ndefensive, would give Sherman a great deal of trouble. That he would be\r\nable to penetrate into the State as far as we were never entered into\r\nour minds.\r\n\r\nBy and by we were astonished at the number of the trains that we\r\ncould hear passing north on the Charleston & Cheraw Railroad. Day\r\nand night for two weeks there did not seem to be more than half an\r\nhour’s interval at any time between the rumble and whistles of the\r\ntrains as they passed Florence Junction, and sped away towards Cheraw,\r\nthirty-five miles north of us. We at length discovered that Sherman had\r\nreached Branchville, and was singing around toward Columbia, and other\r\nimportant points to the north; that Charleston was being evacuated,\r\nand its garrison, munitions and stores were being removed to Cheraw,\r\nwhich the Rebel Generals intended to make their new base. As this news\r\nwas so well confirmed as to leave no doubt of it, it began to wake up\r\nand encourage all the more hopeful of us. We thought we could see some\r\npremonitions of the glorious end, and that we were getting vicarious\r\nsatisfaction at the hands of our friends under the command of Uncle\r\nBilly.\r\n\r\nOne morning orders came for one thousand men to get ready to move.\r\nAndrews and I held a council of war on the situation, the question\r\nbefore the house being whether we would go with that crowd, or stay\r\nbehind. The conclusion we came to was thus stated by Andrews:\r\n\r\n“Now, Mc., we’ve flanked ahead every time, and see how we’ve come\r\nout. We flanked into the first squad that left Richmond, and we were\r\nconsequently in the first that got into Andersonville. May be if\r\nwe’d staid back we’d got into that squad that was exchanged. We were\r\nin the first squad that left Andersonville. We were the first to\r\nleave Savannah and enter Millen. May be if we’d staid back, we’d got\r\nexchanged with the ten thousand sick. We were the first to leave Millen\r\nand the first to reach Blackshear. We were again the first to leave\r\nBlackshear. Perhaps those fellows we left behind then are exchanged.\r\nNow, as we’ve played ahead every time, with such infernal luck, let’s\r\nplay backward this time, and try what that brings us.”\r\n\r\n“But, Lale,” (Andrews’s nickname--his proper name being Bezaleel), said\r\nI, “we made something by going ahead every time--that is, if we were\r\nnot going to be exchanged. By getting into those places first we picked\r\nout the best spots to stay, and got tent-building stuff that those who\r\ncame after us could not. And certainly we can never again get into as\r\nbad a place as this is. The chances are that if this does not mean\r\nexchange, it means transfer to a better prison.”\r\n\r\nBut we concluded, as I said above, to reverse our usual order of\r\nprocedure and flank back, in hopes that something would favor our\r\nescape to Sherman. Accordingly, we let the first squad go off without\r\nus, and the next, and the next, and so on, till there were only eleven\r\nhundred --mostly those sick in the Hospital--remaining behind. Those\r\nwho went away--we afterwards learned, were run down on the cars to\r\nWilmington, and afterwards up to Goldsboro, N. C.\r\n\r\nFor a week or more we eleven hundred tenanted the Stockade, and by\r\nburning up the tents of those who had gone had the only decent,\r\ncomfortable fires we had while in Florence. In hunting around through\r\nthe tents for fuel we found many bodies of those who had died as their\r\ncomrades were leaving. As the larger portion of us could barely walk,\r\nthe Rebels paroled us to remain inside of the Stockade or within a few\r\nhundred yards of the front of it, and took the guards off. While these\r\nwere marching down, a dozen or more of us, exulting in even so much\r\nfreedom as we had obtained, climbed on the Hospital shed to see what\r\nthe outlook was, and perched ourselves on the ridgepole. Lieutenant\r\nBarrett came along, at a distance of two hundred yards, with a squad of\r\nguards. Observing us, he halted his men, faced them toward us, and they\r\nleveled their guns as if to fire. He expected to see us tumble down\r\nin ludicrous alarm, to avoid the bullets. But we hated him and them\r\nso bad, that we could not give them the poor satisfaction of scaring\r\nus. Only one of our party attempted to slide down, but the moment we\r\nswore at him he came back and took his seat with folded arms alongside\r\nof us. Barrett gave the order to fire, and the bullets shrieked aver\r\nour heads, fortunately not hitting anybody. We responded with yells of\r\nderision, and the worst abuse we could think of.\r\n\r\nComing down after awhile, I walked to the now open gate, and looped\r\nthrough it over the barren fields to the dense woods a mile away, and a\r\nwild desire to run off took possession of me. It seemed as if I could\r\nnot resist it. The woods appeared full of enticing shapes, beckoning me\r\nto come to them, and the winds whispered in my ears:\r\n\r\n“Run! Run! Run!”\r\n\r\nBut the words of my parole were still fresh in my mind, and I stilled\r\nmy frenzy to escape by turning back into the Stockade and looking away\r\nfrom the tempting view.\r\n\r\nOnce five new prisoners, the first we had seen in a long time, were\r\nbrought in from Sherman’s army. They were plump, well-conditioned,\r\nwell-dressed, healthy, devil-may-care young fellows, whose confidence\r\nin themselves and in Sherman was simply limitless, and their contempt\r\nfor all Rebels and especially those who terrorized over us, enormous.\r\n\r\n“Come up here to headquarters,” said one of the Rebel officers to them\r\nas they stood talking to us; “and we’ll parole you.”\r\n\r\n“O go to h--- with your parole,” said the spokesman of the crowd, with\r\nnonchalant contempt; “we don’t want none of your paroles. Old Billy’ll\r\nparole us before Saturday.”\r\n\r\nTo us they said:\r\n\r\n“Now, you boys want to cheer right up; keep a stiff upper lip. This\r\nthing’s workin’ all right. Their old Confederacy’s goin’ to pieces like\r\na house afire. Sherman’s promenadin’ through it just as it suits him,\r\nand he’s liable to pay a visit at any hour. We’re expectin’ him all the\r\ntime, because it was generally understood all through the Army that we\r\nwere to take the prison pen here in on our way.”\r\n\r\nI mentioned my distrust of the concentration of Rebels at Cheraw, and\r\ntheir faces took on a look of supreme disdain.\r\n\r\n“Now, don’t let that worry you a minute,” said the confident spokesman.\r\n“All the Rebels between here and Lee’s Army can’t prevent Sherman from\r\ngoing just where he pleases. Why, we’ve quit fightin’ ’em except with\r\nthe Bummers advance. We haven’t had to go into regular line of battle\r\nagainst them for I don’t know how long. Sherman would like anything\r\nbetter than to have ’em make a stand somewhere so that he could get a\r\ngood fair whack at ’em.”\r\n\r\nNo one can imagine the effect of all this upon us. It was better than\r\na carload of medicines and a train load of provisions would have\r\nbeen. From the depths of despondency we sprang at once to tip-toe on\r\nthe mountain-tops of expectation. We did little day and night but\r\nlisten for the sound of Sherman’s guns and discuss what we would do\r\nwhen he came. We planned schemes of terrible vengeance on Barrett and\r\nIverson, but these worthies had mysteriously disappeared--whither no\r\none knew. There was hardly an hour of any night passed without some\r\none of us fancying that he heard the welcome sound of distant firing.\r\nAs everybody knows, by listening intently at night, one can hear just\r\nexactly what he is intent upon hearing, and so was with us. In the\r\nmiddle of the night boys listening awake with strained ears, would say:\r\n\r\n“Now, if ever I heard musketry firing in my life, that’s a heavy\r\nskirmish line at work, and sharply too, and not more than three miles\r\naway, neither.”\r\n\r\nThen another would say:\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to ever get out of here if that don’t sound just as the\r\nskirmishing at Chancellorsville did the first day to us. We were lying\r\ndown about four miles off, when it began pattering just as that is\r\ndoing now.”\r\n\r\nAnd so on.\r\n\r\nOne night about nine or ten, there came two short, sharp peals of\r\nthunder, that sounded precisely like the reports of rifled field\r\npieces. We sprang up in a frenzy of excitement, and shouted as if our\r\nthroats would split. But the next peal went off in the usual rumble,\r\nand our excitement had to subside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVII.\r\n\r\nFRUITLESS WAITING FOR SHERMAN--WE LEAVE FLORENCE--INTELLIGENCE OF THE\r\nFALL OF WILMINGTON COMMUNICATED TO US BY A SLAVE--THE TURPENTINE REGION\r\nOF NORTH CAROLINA--WE COME UPON A REBEL LINE OF BATTLE--YANKEES AT BOTH\r\nENDS OF THE ROAD.\r\n\r\nThings had gone on in the way described in the previous chapter until\r\npast the middle of February. For more than a week every waking hour\r\nwas spent in anxious expectancy of Sherman--listening for the far-off\r\nrattle of his guns--straining our ears to catch the sullen boom of his\r\nartillery--scanning the distant woods to see the Rebels falling back in\r\nhopeless confusion before the pursuit of his dashing advance. Though we\r\nbecame as impatient as those ancient sentinels who for ten long years\r\nstood upon the Grecian hills to catch the first glimpse of the flames\r\nof burning Troy, Sherman came not. We afterwards learned that two\r\nexpeditions were sent down towards us from Cheraw, but they met with\r\nunexpected resistance, and were turned back.\r\n\r\nIt was now plain to us that the Confederacy was tottering to its fall,\r\nand we were only troubled by occasional misgivings that we might in\r\nsome way be caught and crushed under the toppling ruins. It did not\r\nseem possible that with the cruel tenacity with which the Rebels had\r\nclung to us they would be willing to let us go free at last, but\r\nwould be tempted in the rage of their final defeat to commit some\r\nunparalleled atrocity upon us.\r\n\r\nOne day all of us who were able to walk were made to fall in and march\r\nover to the railroad, where we were loaded into boxcars. The sick\r\n--except those who were manifestly dying--were loaded into wagons and\r\nhauled over. The dying were left to their fate, without any companions\r\nor nurses.\r\n\r\nThe train started off in a northeasterly direction, and as we went\r\nthrough Florence the skies were crimson with great fires, burning in\r\nall directions. We were told these were cotton and military stores\r\nbeing destroyed in anticipation of a visit from, a part of Sherman’s\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nWhen morning came we were still running in the same direction that we\r\nstarted. In the confusion of loading us upon the cars the previous\r\nevening, I had been allowed to approach too near a Rebel officer’s\r\nstock of rations, and the result was his being the loser and myself\r\nthe gainer of a canteen filled with fairly good molasses. Andrews and\r\nI had some corn bread, and we, breakfasted sumptuously upon it and the\r\nmolasses, which was certainly none-the-less sweet from having been\r\nstolen.\r\n\r\nOur meal over, we began reconnoitering, as much for employment as\r\nanything else. We were in the front end of a box car. With a saw made\r\non the back of a case-knife we cut a hole through the boards big enough\r\nto permit us to pass out, and perhaps escape. We found that we were\r\non the foremost box car of the train--the next vehicle to us being a\r\npassenger coach, in which were the Rebel officers. On the rear platform\r\nof this car was seated one of their servants--a trusty old slave, well\r\ndressed, for a negro, and as respectful as his class usually was. Said\r\nI to him:\r\n\r\n“Well, uncle, where are they taking us?”\r\n\r\nHe replied:\r\n\r\n“Well, sah, I couldn’t rightly say.”\r\n\r\n“But you could guess, if you tried, couldn’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes sah.”\r\n\r\nHe gave a quick look around to see if the door behind him was so\r\nsecurely shut that he could not be overheard by the Rebels inside the\r\ncar, his dull, stolid face lighted up as a negro’s always does in the\r\nexcitement of doing something cunning, and he said in a loud whisper:\r\n\r\n“Dey’s a-gwine to take you to Wilmington--ef dey kin get you dar!”\r\n\r\n“Can get us there!” said I in astonishment. “Is there anything to\r\nprevent them taking us there?”\r\n\r\nThe dark face filled with inexpressible meaning. I asked:\r\n\r\n“It isn’t possible that there are any Yankees down there to interfere,\r\nis it?”\r\n\r\nThe great eyes flamed up with intelligence to tell me that I guessed\r\naright; again he glanced nervously around to assure himself that no one\r\nwas eavesdropping, and then he said in a whisper, just loud enough to\r\nbe heard above the noise of the moving train:\r\n\r\n“De Yankees took Wilmington yesterday mawning.”\r\n\r\nThe news startled me, but it was true, our troops having driven out the\r\nRebel troops, and entered Wilmington, on the preceding day--the 22d of\r\nFebruary, 1865, as I learned afterwards. How this negro came to know\r\nmore of what was going on than his masters puzzled me much. That he did\r\nknow more was beyond question, since if the Rebels in whose charge we\r\nwere had known of Wilmington’s fall, they would not have gone to the\r\ntrouble of loading us upon the cars and hauling us one, hundred miles\r\nin the direction of a City which had come into the hands of our men.\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted by many writers that the negros had some occult\r\nmeans of diffusing important news among the mass of their people,\r\nprobably by relays of swift runners who traveled at night, going\r\ntwenty-five or thirty miles and back before morning. Very astonishing\r\nstories are told of things communicated in this way across the length\r\nor breadth of the Confederacy. It is said that our officers in the\r\nblockading fleet in the Gulf heard from the negros in advance of the\r\npublication in the Rebel papers of the issuance of the Proclamation\r\nof Emancipation, and of several of our most important Victories. The\r\nincident given above prepares me to believe all that has been told\r\nof the perfection to which the negros had brought their “grapevine\r\ntelegraph,” as it was jocularly termed.\r\n\r\nThe Rebels believed something of it, too. In spite of their rigorous\r\npatrol, an institution dating long before the war, and the severe\r\npunishments visited upon negros found off their master’s premises\r\nwithout a pass, none of them entertained a doubt that the young\r\nnegro men were in the habit of making long, mysterious journeys at\r\nnight, which had other motives than love-making or chicken-stealing.\r\nOccasionally a young man would get caught fifty or seventy-five miles\r\nfrom his “quarters,” while on some errand of his own, the nature\r\nof which no punishment could make him divulge. His master would be\r\nsatisfied that he did not intend running away, because he was likely\r\ngoing in the wrong direction, but beyond this nothing could be\r\nascertained. It was a common belief among overseers, when they saw an\r\nactive, healthy young “buck” sleepy and languid about his work, that he\r\nhad spent the night on one of these excursions.\r\n\r\nThe country we were running through--if such straining, toilsome\r\nprogress as our engine was making could be called running--was a rich\r\nturpentine district. We passed by forests where all the trees were\r\nmarked with long scores through the bark, and extended up to a hight\r\nof twenty feet or more. Into these, the turpentine and rosin, running\r\ndown, were caught, and conveyed by negros to stills near by, where it\r\nwas prepared for market. The stills were as rude as the mills we had\r\nseen in Eastern Tennessee and Kentucky, and were as liable to fiery\r\ndestruction as a powder-house. Every few miles a wide space of ground,\r\nburned clean of trees and underbrush, and yet marked by a portion of\r\nthe stones which had formed the furnace, showed where a turpentine\r\nstill, managed by careless and ignorant blacks, had been licked\r\nup by the breath of flame. They never seemed to re-build on these\r\nspots--whether from superstition or other reasons, I know not.\r\n\r\nOccasionally we came to great piles of barrels of turpentine, rosin\r\nand tar, some of which had laid there since the blockade had cut off\r\ncommunication with the outer world. Many of the barrels of rosin had\r\nburst, and their contents melted in the heat of the sun, had run over\r\nthe ground like streams of lava, covering it to a depth of many inches.\r\nAt the enormous price rosin, tar and turpentine were commanding in the\r\nmarkets of the world, each of these piles represented a superb fortune.\r\nAny one of them, if lying upon the docks of New York, would have\r\nyielded enough to make every one of us upon the train comfortable for\r\nlife. But a few months after the blockade was raised, and they sank to\r\none-thirtieth of their present value.\r\n\r\nThese terebinthine stores were the property of the plantation lords\r\nof the lowlands of North Carolina, who correspond to the pinchbeck\r\nbarons of the rice districts of South Carolina. As there, the whites\r\nand negros we saw were of the lowest, most squalid type of humanity.\r\nThe people of the middle and upland districts of North Carolina are a\r\nmuch superior race to the same class in South Carolina. They are mostly\r\nof Scotch-Irish descent, with a strong infusion of English-Quaker\r\nblood, and resemble much the best of the Virginians. They make an\r\neffort to diffuse education, and have many of the virtues of a simple,\r\nnon-progressive, tolerably industrious middle class. It was here that\r\nthe strong Union sentiment of North Carolina numbered most of its\r\nadherents. The people of the lowlands were as different as if belonging\r\nto another race. The enormous mass of ignorance--the three hundred and\r\nfifty thousand men and women who could not read or write--were mostly\r\nblack and white serfs of the great landholders, whose plantations lie\r\nwithin one hundred miles of the Atlantic coast.\r\n\r\nAs we approached the coast the country became swampier, and our old\r\nacquaintances, the cypress, with their malformed “knees,” became more\r\nand more numerous.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the afternoon our train suddenly stopped. Looking\r\nout to ascertain the cause, we were electrified to see a Rebel line\r\nof battle stretched across the track, about a half mile ahead of the\r\nengine, and with its rear toward us. It was as real a line as was ever\r\nseen on any field. The double ranks of “Butternuts,” with arms gleaming\r\nin the afternoon sun, stretched away out through the open pine woods,\r\nfarther than we could see. Close behind the motionless line stood the\r\ncompany officers, leaning on their drawn swords. Behind these still,\r\nwere the regimental officers on their horses. On a slight rise of the\r\nground, a group of horsemen, to whom other horsemen momentarily dashed\r\nup to or sped away from, showed the station of the General in command.\r\nOn another knoll, at a little distance, were several-field pieces,\r\nstanding “in battery,” the cannoneers at the guns, the postillions\r\ndismounted and holding their horses by the bits, the caisson men\r\nstanding in readiness to serve out ammunition. Our men were evidently\r\nclose at hand in strong force, and the engagement was likely to open at\r\nany instant.\r\n\r\nFor a minute we were speechless with astonishment. Then came a surge\r\nof excitement. What should we do? What could we do? Obviously nothing.\r\nEleven hundred, sick, enfeebled prisoners could not even overpower\r\ntheir guards, let alone make such a diversion in the rear of a\r\nline-of-battle as would assist our folks to gain a victory. But while\r\nwe debated the engine whistled sharply--a frightened shriek it sounded\r\nto us--and began pushing our train rapidly backward over the rough and\r\nwretched track. Back, back we went, as fast as rosin and pine knots\r\ncould force the engine to move us. The cars swayed continually back and\r\nforth, momentarily threatening to fly the crazy roadway, and roll over\r\nthe embankment or into one of the adjacent swamps. We would have hailed\r\nsuch a catastrophe, as it would have probably killed more of the guards\r\nthan of us, and the confusion would have given many of the survivors\r\nopportunity to escape. But no such accident happened, and towards\r\nmidnight we reached the bridge across the Great Pedee River, where\r\nour train was stopped by a squad of Rebel cavalrymen, who brought the\r\nintelligence that as Kilpatrick was expected into Florence every hour,\r\nit would not do to take us there.\r\n\r\nWe were ordered off the cars, and laid down on the banks of the Great\r\nPedee, our guards and the cavalry forming a line around us, and taking\r\nprecautions to defend the bridge against Kilpatrick, should he find out\r\nour whereabouts and come after us.\r\n\r\n“Well, Mc,” said Andrews, as we adjusted our old overcoat and blanket\r\non the ground for a bed; “I guess we needn’t care whether school keeps\r\nor not. Our fellows have evidently got both ends of the road, and are\r\ncoming towards us from each way. There’s no road--not even a wagon\r\nroad --for the Johnnies to run us off on, and I guess all we’ve got to\r\ndo is to stand still and see the salvation of the Lord. Bad as these\r\nhounds are, I don’t believe they will shoot us down rather than let our\r\nfolks retake us. At least they won’t since old Winder’s dead. If he was\r\nalive, he’d order our throats cut--one by one--with the guards’ pocket\r\nknives, rather than give us up. I’m only afraid we’ll be allowed to\r\nstarve before our folks reach us.”\r\n\r\nI concurred in this view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVIII.\r\n\r\nRETURN TO FLORENCE AND A SHORT SOJOURN THERE--OFF TOWARDS WILMINGTON\r\nAGAIN--CRUISING A REBEL OFFICER’S LUNCH--SIGNS OF APPROACHING OUR LINES\r\n--TERROR OF OUR RASCALLY GUARDS--ENTRANCE INTO GOD’S COUNTRY AT LAST.\r\n\r\nBut Kilpatrick, like Sherman, came not. Perhaps he knew that all the\r\nprisoners had been removed from the Stockade; perhaps he had other\r\nbusiness of more importance on hand; probably his movement was only\r\na feint. At all events it was definitely known the next day that he\r\nhad withdrawn so far as to render it wholly unlikely that he intended\r\nattacking Florence, so we were brought back and returned to our old\r\nquarters. For a week or more we loitered about the now nearly-abandoned\r\nprison; skulked and crawled around the dismal mud-tents like the\r\nghostly denizens of some Potter’s Field, who, for some reason had been\r\nallowed to return to earth, and for awhile creep painfully around the\r\nlittle hillocks beneath which they had been entombed.\r\n\r\nA few score, whose vital powers were strained to the last degree of\r\ntension, gave up the ghost, and sank to dreamless rest. It mattered\r\nnow little to these when Sherman came, or when Kilpatrick’s guidons\r\nshould flutter through the forest of sighing pines, heralds of life,\r\nhappiness, and home--\r\n\r\n               After life’s fitful fever they slept well\r\n               Treason had done its worst. Nor steel nor poison:\r\n               Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing\r\n               Could touch them farther.\r\n\r\nOne day another order came for us to be loaded on the cars, and over\r\nto the railroad we went again in the same fashion as before. The\r\ncomparatively few of us who were still able to walk at all well, loaded\r\nourselves down with the bundles and blankets of our less fortunate\r\ncompanions, who hobbled and limped--many even crawling on their hands\r\nand knees--over the hard, frozen ground, by our sides.\r\n\r\nThose not able to crawl even, were taken in wagons, for the orders were\r\nimperative not to leave a living prisoner behind.\r\n\r\nAt the railroad we found two trains awaiting us. On the front of each\r\nengine were two rude white flags, made by fastening the halves of meal\r\nsacks to short sticks. The sight of these gave us some hope, but our\r\nbelief that Rebels were constitutional liars and deceivers was so firm\r\nand fixed, that we persuaded ourselves that the flags meant nothing\r\nmore than some wilful delusion for us.\r\n\r\nAgain we started off in the direction of Wilmington, and traversed the\r\nsame country described in the previous chapter. Again Andrews and I\r\nfound ourselves in the next box car to the passenger coach containing\r\nthe Rebel officers. Again we cut a hole through the end, with our saw,\r\nand again found a darky servant sitting on the rear platform. Andrews\r\nwent out and sat down alongside of him, and found that he was seated\r\nupon a large gunny-bag sack containing the cooked rations of the Rebel\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nThe intelligence that there was something there worth taking Andrews\r\ncommunicated to me by an expressive signal, of which soldiers\r\ncampaigning together as long as he and I had, always have an extensive\r\nand well understood code.\r\n\r\nI took a seat in the hole we had made in the end of the car, in reach\r\nof Andrews. Andrews called the attention of the negro to some feature\r\nof the country near by, and asked him a question in regard to it. As he\r\nlooked in the direction indicated, Andrews slipped his hand into the\r\nmouth of the bag, and pulled out a small sack of wheat biscuits, which\r\nhe passed to me and I concealed. The darky turned and told Andrews all\r\nabout the matter in regard to which the interrogation had been made.\r\nAndrews became so much interested in what was being told him, that he\r\nsat up closer and closer to the darky, who in turn moved farther away\r\nfrom the sack.\r\n\r\nNext we ran through a turpentine plantation, and as the darky was\r\npointing out where the still, the master’s place, the “quarters,” etc.,\r\nwere, Andrews managed to fish out of that bag and pass to me three\r\nroasted chickens. Then a great swamp called for description, and before\r\nwe were through with it, I had about a peck of boiled sweet potatos.\r\n\r\nAndrews emptied the bag as the darky was showing him a great peanut\r\nplantation, taking from it a small frying-pan, a canteen of molasses,\r\nand a half-gallon tin bucket, which had been used to make coffee in. We\r\ndivided up our wealth of eatables with the rest of the boys in the car,\r\nnot forgetting to keep enough to give ourselves a magnificent meal.\r\n\r\nAs we ran along we searched carefully for the place where we had seen\r\nthe line-of-battle, expecting that it would now be marked with signs of\r\na terrible conflict, but we could see nothing. We could not even fix\r\nthe locality where the line stood.\r\n\r\nAs it became apparent that we were going directly toward Wilmington,\r\nas fast as our engines could pull us, the excitement rose. We had\r\nmany misgivings as to whether our folks still retained possession of\r\nWilmington, and whether, if they did, the Rebels could not stop at a\r\npoint outside of our lines, and transfer us to some other road.\r\n\r\nFor hours we had seen nobody in the country through which we were\r\npassing. What few houses were visible were apparently deserted,\r\nand there were no Towns or stations anywhere. We were very anxious\r\nto see some one, in hopes of getting a hint of what the state of\r\naffairs was in the direction we were going. At length we saw a young\r\nman--apparently a scout--on horseback, but his clothes were equally\r\ndivided between the blue and the butternut, as to give no clue to which\r\nside he belonged.\r\n\r\nAn hour later we saw two infantrymen, who were evidently out foraging.\r\nThey had sacks of something on their backs, and wore blue clothes. This\r\nwas a very hopeful sign of a near approach to our lines, but bitter\r\nexperience in the past warned us against being too sanguine.\r\n\r\nAbout 4 o’clock P. M., the trains stopped and whistled long and loud.\r\nLooking out I could see--perhaps half-a-mile away--a line of rifle pits\r\nrunning at right angles with the track. Guards, whose guns flashed as\r\nthey turned, were pacing up and down, but they were too far away for me\r\nto distinguish their uniforms.\r\n\r\nThe suspense became fearful.\r\n\r\nBut I received much encouragement from the singular conduct of our\r\nguards. First I noticed a Captain, who had been especially mean to us\r\nwhile at Florence.\r\n\r\nHe was walking on the ground by the train. His face was pale, his teeth\r\nset, and his eyes shone with excitement. He called out in a strange,\r\nforced voice to his men and boys on the roof of the cars:\r\n\r\n“Here, you fellers git down off’en thar and form a line.”\r\n\r\nThe fellows did so, in a slow, constrained, frightened ways and huddled\r\ntogether, in the most unsoldierly manner.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing reminded me of a scene I once saw in our line,\r\nwhere a weak-kneed Captain was ordered to take a party of rather\r\nchicken-hearted recruits out on the skirmish-line.\r\n\r\nWe immediately divined what was the matter. The lines in front of us\r\nwere really those of our people, and the idiots of guards, not knowing\r\nof their entire safety when protected by a flag of truce, were scared\r\nhalf out of their small wits at approaching so near to armed Yankees.\r\n\r\nWe showered taunts and jeers upon them. An Irishman in my car yelled\r\nout:\r\n\r\n“Och, ye dirty spalpeens; it’s not shootin’ prisoners ye are now; it’s\r\ncumin’ where the Yankee b’ys hev the gun; and the minnit ye say thim\r\nyer white livers show themselves in yer pale faces. Bad luck to the\r\nblatherin’ bastards that yez are, and to the mothers that bore ye.”\r\n\r\nAt length our train moved up so near to the line that I could see it\r\nwas the grand, old loyal blue that clothed the forms of the men who\r\nwere pacing up and down.\r\n\r\nAnd certainly the world does not hold as superb looking men as these\r\nappeared to me. Finely formed, stalwart, full-fed and well clothed,\r\nthey formed the most delightful contrast with the scrawny, shambling,\r\nvillain-visaged little clay-eaters and white trash who had looked down\r\nupon us from the sentry boxes for many long months.\r\n\r\nI sprang out of the cars and began washing my face and hands in the\r\nditch at the side of the road. The Rebel Captain, noticing me, said, in\r\nthe old, hateful, brutal, imperious tone:\r\n\r\n“Git back in dat cah, dah.”\r\n\r\nAn hour before I would have scrambled back as quickly as possible,\r\nknowing that an instant’s hesitation would be followed by a bullet.\r\nNow, I looked him in the face, and said as irritatingly as possible:\r\n\r\n“O, you go to ----, you Rebel. I’m going into Uncle Sam’s lines with as\r\nlittle Rebel filth on me as possible.”\r\n\r\nHe passed me without replying.\r\n\r\nHis day of shooting was past.\r\n\r\nDescending from the cars, we passed through the guards into our lines,\r\na Rebel and a Union clerk checking us off as we passed. By the time it\r\nwas dark we were all under our flag again.\r\n\r\nThe place where we came through was several miles west of Wilmington,\r\nwhere the railroad crossed a branch of the Cape Fear River. The point\r\nwas held by a brigade of Schofield’s army--the Twenty-Third Army Corps.\r\n\r\nThe boys lavished unstinted kindness upon us. All of the brigade off\r\nduty crowded around, offering us blankets, shirts shoes, pantaloons and\r\nother articles of clothing and similar things that we were obviously\r\nin the greatest need of. The sick were carried, by hundreds of willing\r\nhands, to a sheltered spot, and laid upon good, comfortable beds\r\nimprovised with leaves and blankets. A great line of huge, generous\r\nfires was built, that every one of us could have plenty of place around\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBy and by a line of wagons came over from Wilmington laden with\r\nrations, and they were dispensed to us with what seemed reckless\r\nprodigality. The lid of a box of hard tack would be knocked off, and\r\nthe contents handed to us as we filed past, with absolute disregard as\r\nto quantity. If a prisoner looked wistful after receiving one handful\r\nof crackers, another was handed to him; if his long-famished eyes still\r\nlingered as if enchained by the rare display of food, the men who were\r\nissuing said:\r\n\r\n“Here, old fellow, there’s plenty of it: take just as much as you can\r\ncarry in your arms.”\r\n\r\nSo it was also with the pickled pork, the coffee, the sugar, etc. We\r\nhad been stinted and starved so long that we could not comprehend that\r\nthere was anywhere actually enough of anything.\r\n\r\nThe kind-hearted boys who were acting as our hosts began preparing\r\nfood for the sick, but the Surgeons, who had arrived in the meanwhile,\r\nwere compelled to repress them, as it was plain that while it was a\r\ndangerous experiment to give any of us all we could or would eat, it\r\nwould never do to give the sick such a temptation to kill themselves,\r\nand only a limited amount of food was allowed to be given those who\r\nwere unable to walk.\r\n\r\nAndrews and I hungered for coffee, the delightful fumes of which filled\r\nthe air and intoxicated our senses. We procured enough to make our\r\nhalf-gallon bucket full and very strong.\r\n\r\nWe drank so much of this that Andrews became positively drunk, and fell\r\nhelplessly into some brush. I pulled him out and dragged him away to a\r\nplace where we had made our rude bed.\r\n\r\nI was dazed. I could not comprehend that the long-looked for,\r\noften-despaired-of event had actually happened. I feared that it was\r\none of those tantalizing dreams that had so often haunted my sleep,\r\nonly to be followed by a wretched awakening. Then I became seized with\r\na sudden fear lest the Rebel attempt to retake me. The line of guards\r\naround us seemed very slight. It might be forced in the night, and all\r\nof us recaptured. Shivering at this thought, absurd though it was, I\r\narose from our bed, and taking Andrews with me, crawled two or three\r\nhundred yards into a dense undergrowth, where in the event of our lines\r\nbeing forced, we would be overlooked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIX.\r\n\r\nGETTING USED TO FREEDOM--DELIGHTS OF A LAND WHERE THERE IS ENOUGH\r\nOF EVERYTHING--FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE OLD FLAG--WILMINGTON AND ITS\r\nHISTORY --LIEUTENANT CUSHING--FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE COLORED\r\nTROOPS--LEAVING FOR HOME--DESTRUCTION OF THE “THORN” BY A TORPEDO--THE\r\nMOCK MONITOR’S ACHIEVEMENT.\r\n\r\nAfter a sound sleep, Andrews and I awoke to the enjoyment of our first\r\nday of freedom and existence in God’s country. The sun had already\r\nrisen, bright and warm, consonant with the happiness of the new life\r\nnow opening up for us.\r\n\r\nBut to nearly a score of our party his beams brought no awakening\r\ngladness. They fell upon stony, staring eyes, from out of which the\r\nlight of life had now faded, as the light of hope had done long ago.\r\nThe dead lay there upon the rude beds of fallen leaves, scraped\r\ntogether by thoughtful comrades the night before, their clenched teeth\r\nshowing through parted lips, faces fleshless and pinched, long, unkempt\r\nand ragged hair and whiskers just stirred by the lazy breeze, the\r\nrotting feet and limbs drawn up, and skinny hands clenched in the last\r\nagonies.\r\n\r\nTheir fate seemed harder than that of any who had died before them. It\r\nwas doubtful if many of them knew that they were at last inside of our\r\nown lines.\r\n\r\nAgain the kind-hearted boys of the brigade crowded around us with\r\nproffers of service. Of an Ohio boy who directed his kind tenders to\r\nAndrews and me, we procured a chunk of coarse rosin soap about as big\r\nas a pack of cards, and a towel. Never was there as great a quantity\r\nof solid comfort got out of that much soap as we obtained. It was the\r\nfirst that we had since that which I stole in Wirz’s headquarters, in\r\nJune --nine months before. We felt that the dirt which had accumulated\r\nupon us since then would subject us to assessment as real estate if we\r\nwere in the North.\r\n\r\nHurrying off to a little creek we began our ablutions, and it was not\r\nlong until Andrews declared that there was a perceptible sand-bar\r\nforming in the stream, from what we washed off. Dirt deposits of the\r\nPliocene era rolled off feet and legs. Eocene incrustations let loose\r\nreluctantly from neck and ears; the hair was a mass of tangled locks\r\nmatted with nine months’ accumulation of pitch pine tar, rosin soot,\r\nand South Carolina sand, that we did not think we had better start in\r\nupon it until we either had the shock cut off, or had a whole ocean and\r\na vat of soap to wash it out with.\r\n\r\nAfter scrubbing until we were exhausted we got off the first few outer\r\nlayers--the post tertiary formation, a geologist would term it--and the\r\nsmell of many breakfasts cooking, coming down over the hill, set our\r\nstomachs in a mutiny against any longer fasting.\r\n\r\nWe went back, rosy, panting, glowing, but happy, to get our selves some\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\nShould Providence, for some inscrutable reason, vouchsafe me the years\r\nof Methuselah, one of the pleasantest recollections that will abide\r\nwith me to the close of the nine hundredth and sixty-ninth year, will\r\nbe of that delightful odor of cooking food which regaled our senses as\r\nwe came back. From the boiling coffee and the meat frying in the pan\r\nrose an incense sweeter to the senses a thousand times than all the\r\nperfumes of far Arabia. It differed from the loathsome odor of cooking\r\ncorn meal as much as it did from the effluvia of a sewer.\r\n\r\nOur noses were the first of our senses to bear testimony that we had\r\npassed from the land of starvation to that of plenty. Andrews and I\r\nhastened off to get our own breakfast, and soon had a half-gallon\r\nof strong coffee, and a frying-pan full, of meat cooking over the\r\nfire--not one of the beggarly skimped little fires we had crouched over\r\nduring our months of imprisonment, but a royal, generous fire, fed with\r\nlogs instead of shavings and splinters, and giving out heat enough to\r\nwarm a regiment.\r\n\r\nHaving eaten positively all that we could swallow, those of us who\r\ncould walk were ordered to fall in and march over to Wilmington. We\r\ncrossed the branch of the river on a pontoon bridge, and took the road\r\nthat led across the narrow sandy island between the two branches,\r\nWilmington being situated on the opposite bank of the farther one.\r\n\r\nWhen about half way a shout from some one in advance caused us to look\r\nup, and then we saw, flying from a tall steeple in Wilmington, the\r\nglorious old Stars and Stripes, resplendent in the morning sun, and\r\nmore beautiful than the most gorgeous web from Tyrian looms. We stopped\r\nwith one accord, and shouted and cheered and cried until every throat\r\nwas sore and every eye red and blood-shot. It seemed as if our cup of\r\nhappiness would certainly run over if any more additions were made to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at the bank of the river opposite Wilmington, a whole\r\nworld of new and interesting sights opened up before us. Wilmington,\r\nduring the last year-and-a-half of the war, was, next to Richmond, the\r\nmost important place in the Southern Confederacy. It was the only port\r\nto which blockade running was at all safe enough to be lucrative. The\r\nRebels held the strong forts of Caswell and Fisher, at the mouth of\r\nCape Fear River, and outside, the Frying Pan Shoals, which extended\r\nalong the coast forty or fifty miles, kept our blockading fleet so\r\nfar off, and made the line so weak and scattered, that there was\r\ncomparatively little risk to the small, swift-sailing vessels employed\r\nby the blockade runners in running through it. The only way that\r\nblockade running could be stopped was by the reduction of Forts Caswell\r\nand Fisher, and it was not stopped until this was done.\r\n\r\nBefore the war Wilmington was a dull, sleepy North Carolina Town, with\r\nas little animation of any kind as a Breton Pillage. The only business\r\nwas the handling of the tar, turpentine, rosin, and peanuts produced\r\nin the surrounding country, a business never lively enough to excite\r\nmore than a lazy ripple in the sluggish lagoons of trade. But very\r\nnew wine was put into this old bottle when blockade running began to\r\ndevelop in importance. Then this Sleepy hollow of a place took on\r\nthe appearance of San Francisco in the hight of the gold fever. The\r\nEnglish houses engaged in blockade running established branches there\r\nconducted by young men who lived like princes. All the best houses in\r\nthe City were leased by them and fitted up in the most gorgeous style.\r\nThey literally clothed themselves in purple and fine linen and fared\r\nsumptuously every day, with their fine wines and imported delicacies\r\nand retinue of servants to wait upon them. Fast young Rebel officers,\r\neager for a season of dissipation, could imagine nothing better than\r\na leave of absence to go to Wilmington. Money flowed like water. The\r\ncommon sailors--the scum of all foreign ports--who manned the blockade\r\nrunners, received as high as one hundred dollars in gold per month,\r\nand a bounty of fifty dollars for every successful trip, which from\r\nNassau could be easily made in seven days. Other people were paid in\r\nproportion, and as the old proverb says, “What comes over the Devil’s\r\nback is spent under his breast,” the money so obtained was squandered\r\nrecklessly, and all sorts of debauchery ran riot.\r\n\r\nOn the ground where we were standing had been erected several large\r\nsteam cotton presses, built to compress cotton for the blockade\r\nrunners. Around them were stored immense quantities of cotton, and\r\nnear by were nearly as great stores of turpentine, rosin and tar. A\r\nlittle farther down the river was navy yard with docks, etc., for the\r\naccommodation, building and repair of blockade runners. At the time our\r\nfolks took Fort Fisher and advanced on Wilmington the docks were filled\r\nwith vessels. The retreating Rebels set fire to everything--cotton,\r\ncotton presses, turpentine, rosin, tar, navy yard, naval stores,\r\ntimber, docks, and vessels, and the fire made clean work. Our people\r\narrived too late to save anything, and when we came in the smoke from\r\nthe burned cotton, turpentine, etc., still filled the woods. It was a\r\nsignal illustration of the ravages of war. Here had been destroyed, in\r\na few hours, more property than a half-million industrious men would\r\naccumulate in their lives.\r\n\r\nAlmost as gratifying as the sight of the old flag flying in triumph,\r\nwas the exhibition of our naval power in the river before us. The\r\nlarger part of the great North Atlantic squadron, which had done such\r\nexcellent service in the reduction of the defenses of Wilmington, was\r\nlying at anchor, with their hundreds of huge guns yawning as if ardent\r\nfor more great forts to beat down, more vessels to sink, more heavy\r\nartillery to crush, more Rebels to conquer. It seemed as if there were\r\ncannon enough there to blow the whole Confederacy into kingdom-come.\r\nAll was life and animation around the fleet. On the decks the officers\r\nwere pacing up and down. One on each vessel carried a long telescope,\r\nwith which he almost constantly swept the horizon. Numberless small\r\nboats, each rowed by neatly-uniformed men, and carrying a flag in the\r\nstern, darted hither and thither, carrying officers on errands of duty\r\nor pleasure. It was such a scene as enabled me to realize in a measure,\r\nthe descriptions I had read of the pomp and circumstance of naval\r\nwarfare.\r\n\r\nWhile we were standing, contemplating all the interesting sights within\r\nview, a small steamer, about the size of a canal-boat, and carrying\r\nseveral bright brass guns, ran swiftly and noiselessly up to the dock\r\nnear by, and a young, pale-faced officer, slender in build and nervous\r\nin manner, stepped ashore. Some of the blue jackets who were talking\r\nto us looked at him and the vessel with the greatest expression of\r\ninterest, and said:\r\n\r\n“Hello! there’s the ‘Monticello’ and Lieutenant Cushing.”\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the naval boy hero, with whose exploits the whole\r\ncountry was ringing. Our sailor friends proceeded to tell us of his\r\nachievements, of which they were justly proud. They told us of his\r\nperilous scouts and his hairbreadth escapes, of his wonderful audacity\r\nand still more wonderful success--of his capture of Towns with a\r\nhandful of sailors, and the destruction of valuable stores, etc. I felt\r\nvery sorry that the man was not a cavalry commander. There he would\r\nhave had full scope for his peculiar genius. He had come prominently\r\ninto notice in the preceding Autumn, when he had, by one of the most\r\ndaring performances narrated in naval history, destroyed the formidable\r\nram “Albermarle.” This vessel had been constructed by the Rebels on the\r\nRoanoke River, and had done them very good service, first by assisting\r\nto reduce the forts and capture the garrison at Plymouth, N. C., and\r\nafterward in some minor engagements. In October, 1864, she was lying at\r\nPlymouth. Around her was a boom of logs to prevent sudden approaches\r\nof boats or vessels from our fleet. Cushing, who was then barely\r\ntwenty-one, resolved to attempt her destruction. He fitted up a steam\r\nlaunch with a long spar to which he attached a torpedo. On the night of\r\nOctober 27th, with thirteen companions, he ran quietly up the Sound and\r\nwas not discovered until his boat struck the boom, when a terrific fire\r\nwas opened upon him. Backing a short distance, he ran at the boom with\r\nsuch velocity that his boat leaped across it into the water beyond.\r\nIn an instant more his torpedo struck the side of the “Albemarle” and\r\nexploded, tearing a great hole in her hull, which sank her in a few\r\nminutes. At the moment the torpedo went off the “Albermarle” fired one\r\nof her great guns directly into the launch, tearing it completely to\r\npieces. Lieutenant Cushing and one comrade rose to the surface of the\r\nseething water and, swimming ashore, escaped. What became of the rest\r\nis not known, but their fate can hardly be a matter of doubt.\r\n\r\nWe were ferried across the river into Wilmington, and marched up the\r\nstreets to some vacant ground near the railroad depot, where we found\r\nmost of our old Florence comrades already assembled. When they left us\r\nin the middle of February they were taken to Wilmington, and thence to\r\nGoldsboro, N. C., where they were kept until the rapid closing in of\r\nour Armies made it impracticable to hold them any longer, when they\r\nwere sent back to Wilmington and given up to our forces as we had been.\r\n\r\nIt was now nearly noon, and we were ordered to fall in and draw\r\nrations, a bewildering order to us, who had been so long in the\r\nhabit of drawing food but once a day. We fell in in single rank, and\r\nmarched up, one at a time, past where a group of employees of the\r\nCommissary Department dealt out the food. One handed each prisoner as\r\nhe passed a large slice of meat; another gave him a handful of ground\r\ncoffee; a third a handful of sugar; a fourth gave him a pickle, while\r\na fifth and sixth handed him an onion and a loaf of fresh bread.\r\nThis filled the horn of our plenty full. To have all these in one\r\nday--meat, coffee, sugar, onions and soft bread--was simply to riot\r\nin undreamed-of luxury. Many of the boys--poor fellows--could not yet\r\nrealize that there was enough for all, or they could not give up their\r\nold “flanking” tricks, and they stole around, and falling into the\r\nrear, came up again for’ another share. We laughed at them, as did\r\nthe Commissary men, who, nevertheless, duplicated the rations already\r\nreceived, and sent them away happy and content.\r\n\r\nWhat a glorious dinner Andrews and I had, with our half gallon of\r\nstrong coffee, our soft bread, and a pan full of fried pork and onions!\r\nSuch an enjoyable feast will never be, eaten again by us.\r\n\r\nHere we saw negro troops under arms for the first time--the most of the\r\norganization of colored soldiers having been, done since our capture.\r\nIt was startling at first to see a stalwart, coal-black negro stalking\r\nalong with a Sergeant’s chevrons on his arm, or to gaze on a regimental\r\nline of dusky faces on dress parade, but we soon got used to it. The\r\nfirst strong peculiarity of the negro soldier that impressed itself,\r\nupon us was his literal obedience of orders. A white soldier usually\r\nallows himself considerable discretion in obeying orders--he aims more\r\nat the spirit, while the negro adheres to the strict letter of the\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the second day after our arrival a line of guards were\r\nplaced around us, with orders not to allow any of us to go up town\r\nwithout a pass. The reason of this was that many weak--even dying-men\r\nwould persist in wandering about, and would be found exhausted,\r\nfrequently dead, in various parts of the City. Andrews and I concluded\r\nto go up town. Approaching a negro sentinel he warned us back with,\r\n\r\n“Stand back, dah; don’t come any furder; it’s agin de awdahs; you can’t\r\npass.”\r\n\r\nHe would not allow us to argue the case, but brought his gun to such a\r\nthreatening position that we fell back. Going down the line a little\r\nfarther, we came to a white sentinel, to whom I said:\r\n\r\n“Comrade, what are your orders:”\r\n\r\nHe replied:\r\n\r\n“My orders are not to let any of you fellows pass, but my beat only\r\nextends to that out-house there.”\r\n\r\nActing on this plain hint, we walked around the house and went up-town.\r\nThe guard simply construed his orders in a liberal spirit. He reasoned\r\nthat they hardly applied to us, since we were evidently able to take\r\ncare of ourselves.\r\n\r\nLater we had another illustration of this dog like fidelity of the\r\ncolored sentinel. A number of us were quartered in a large and empty\r\nwarehouse. On the same floor, and close to us, were a couple of very\r\nfine horses belonging to some officer. We had not been in the warehouse\r\nvery long until we concluded that the straw with which the horses were\r\nbedded would be better used in making couches for ourselves, and this\r\nsuggestion was instantly acted upon, and so thoroughly that there was\r\nnot a straw left between the animals and the bare boards. Presently the\r\nowner of the horses came in, and he was greatly incensed at what had\r\nbeen done. He relieved his mind of a few sulphurous oaths, and going\r\nout, came back soon with a man with more straw, and a colored soldier\r\nwhom he stationed by the horses, saying:\r\n\r\n“Now, look here. You musn’t let anybody take anything sway from these\r\nstalls; d’you understand me?--not a thing.”\r\n\r\nHe then went out. Andrews and I had just finished cooking dinner, and\r\nwere sitting down to eat it. Wishing to lend our frying-pan to another\r\nmess, I looked around for something to lay our meat upon. Near the\r\nhorses I saw a book cover, which would answer the purpose admirably.\r\nSpringing up, I skipped across to where it was, snatched it up, and\r\nran back to my place. As I reached it a yell from the boys made me\r\nlook around. The darky was coming at me “full tilt,” with his gun at a\r\n“charge bayonets.” As I turned he said:\r\n\r\n“Put dat right back dah!”\r\n\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n“Why, this don’t amount to anything, this is only an old book cover. It\r\nhasn’t anything in the world to do with the horses.”\r\n\r\nHe only replied:\r\n\r\n“Put dat right back dah!”\r\n\r\nI tried another appeal:\r\n\r\n“Now, you woolly-headed son of thunder, haven’t you got sense enough to\r\nknow that the officer who posted you didn’t mean such a thing as this!\r\nHe only meant that we should not be allowed to take any of the horses’\r\nbedding or equipments; don’t you see?”\r\n\r\nI might as well have reasoned with a cigar store Indian. He set his\r\nteeth, his eyes showed a dangerous amount of white, and foreshortening\r\nhis musket for a lunge, he hissed out again “Put dat right back dah, I\r\ntell you!”\r\n\r\nI looked at the bayonet; it was very long, very bright, and very sharp.\r\nIt gleamed cold and chilly like, as if it had not run through a man\r\nfor a long time, and yearned for another opportunity. Nothing but the\r\nwhites of the darky’s eyes could now be seen. I did not want to perish\r\nthere in the fresh bloom of my youth and loveliness; it seemed to me as\r\nif it was my duty to reserve myself for fields of future usefulness, so\r\nI walked back and laid the book cover precisely on the spot whence I\r\nhad obtained it, while the thousand boys in the house set up a yell of\r\nsarcastic laughter.\r\n\r\nWe staid in Wilmington a few days, days of almost purely animal\r\nenjoyment--the joy of having just as much to eat as we could possibly\r\nswallow, and no one to molest or make us afraid in any way. How we\r\ndid eat and fill up. The wrinkles in our skin smoothed out under the\r\nstretching, and we began to feel as if we were returning to our old\r\nplumpness, though so far the plumpness was wholly abdominal.\r\n\r\nOne morning we were told that the transports would begin going back\r\nwith us that afternoon, the first that left taking the sick. Andrews\r\nand I, true to our old prison practices, resolved to be among those\r\non the first boat. We slipped through the guards and going up town,\r\nwent straight to Major General Schofield’s headquarters and solicited\r\na pass to go on the first boat--the steamer “Thorn.” General Schofield\r\ntreated us very kindly; but declined to let anybody but the helplessly\r\nsick go on the “Thorn.” Defeated here we went down to where the vessel\r\nwas lying at the dock, and tried to smuggle ourselves aboard, but the\r\nguard was too strong and too vigilant, and we were driven away. Going\r\nalong the dock, angry and discouraged by our failure, we saw a Surgeon,\r\nat a little distance, who was examining and sending the sick who could\r\nwalk aboard another vessel--the “General Lyon.” We took our cue, and a\r\nlittle shamming secured from him tickets which permitted us to take our\r\npassage in her. The larger portion of those on board were in the hold,\r\nand a few were on deck. Andrews and I found a snug place under the\r\nforecastle, by the anchor chains.\r\n\r\nBoth vessels speedily received their complement, and leaving their\r\ndocks, started down the river. The “Thorn” steamed ahead of us, and\r\ndisappeared. Shortly after we got under way, the Colonel who was put in\r\ncommand of the boat--himself a released prisoner--came around on a tour\r\nof inspection. He found about one thousand of us aboard, and singling\r\nme out made me the non-commissioned officer in command. I was put in\r\ncharge, of issuing the rations and of a barrel of milk punch which the\r\nSanitary Commission had sent down to be dealt out on the voyage to such\r\nas needed it. I went to work and arranged the boys in the best way I\r\ncould, and returned to the deck to view the scenery.\r\n\r\nWilmington is thirty-four miles from the sea, and the river for that\r\ndistance is a calm, broad estuary. At this time the resources of Rebel\r\nengineering were exhausted in defense against its passage by a hostile\r\nfleet, and undoubtedly the best work of the kind in the Southern\r\nConfederacy was done upon it. At its mouth were Forts Fisher and\r\nCaswell, the strongest sea coast forts in the Confederacy. Fort Caswell\r\nwas an old United States fort, much enlarged and strengthened. Fort\r\nFisher was a new work, begun immediately after the beginning of the\r\nwar, and labored at incessantly until captured. Behind these every one\r\nof the thirty-four miles to Wilmington was covered with the fire of the\r\nbest guns the English arsenals could produce, mounted on forts built\r\nat every advantageous spot. Lines of piles running out into the water,\r\nforced incoming vessels to wind back and forth across the stream under\r\nthe point-blank range of massive Armstrong rifles. As if this were not\r\nsufficient, the channel was thickly studded with torpedoes that would\r\nexplode at the touch of the keel of a passing vessel. These abundant\r\nprecautions, and the telegram from General Lee, found in Fort Fisher,\r\nstating that unless that stronghold and Fort Caswell were held he could\r\nnot hold Richmond, give some idea of the importance of the place to the\r\nRebels.\r\n\r\nWe passed groups of hundreds of sailors fishing for torpedos, and saw\r\nmany of these dangerous monsters, which they had hauled up out of the\r\nwater. We caught up with the “Thorn,” when about half way to the sea,\r\npassed her, to our great delight, and soon left a gap between us of\r\nnearly half-a-mile. We ran through an opening in the piling, holding up\r\nclose to the left side, and she apparently followed our course exactly.\r\nSuddenly there was a dull roar; a column of water, bearing with it\r\nfragments of timbers, planking and human bodies, rose up through one\r\nside of the vessel, and, as it fell, she lurched forward and sank. She\r\nhad struck a torpedo. I never learned the number lost, but it must have\r\nbeen very great.\r\n\r\nSome little time after this happened we approached Fort Anderson, the\r\nmost powerful of the works between Wilmington and the forts at the\r\nmouth of the sea. It was built on the ruins of the little Town of\r\nBrunswick, destroyed by Cornwallis during the Revolutionary War. We\r\nsaw a monitor lying near it, and sought good positions to view this\r\nspecimen of the redoubtable ironclads of which we had heard and read\r\nso much. It looked precisely as it did in pictures, as black, as grim,\r\nand as uncompromising as the impregnable floating fortress which had\r\nbrought the “Merrimac” to terms.\r\n\r\nBut as we approached closely we noticed a limpness about the smoke\r\nstack that seemed very inconsistent with the customary rigidity of\r\ncylindrical iron. Then the escape pipe seemed scarcely able to maintain\r\nitself upright. A few minutes later we discovered that our terrible\r\nCyclops of the sea was a flimsy humbug, a theatrical imitation, made by\r\nstretching blackened canvas over a wooden frame.\r\n\r\nOne of the officers on board told us its story. After the fall of Fort\r\nFisher the Rebels retired to Fort Anderson, and offered a desperate\r\nresistance to our army and fleet. Owing to the shallowness of the water\r\nthe latter could not come into close enough range to do effective work.\r\nThen the happy idea of this sham monitor suggested itself to some one.\r\nIt was prepared, and one morning before daybreak it was sent floating\r\nin on the tide. The other monitors opened up a heavy fire from their\r\nposition. The Rebels manned their guns and replied vigorously, by\r\nconcentrating a terrible cannonade on the sham monitor, which sailed\r\ngrandly on, undisturbed by the heavy rifled bolts tearing through her\r\ncanvas turret. Almost frantic with apprehension of the result if she\r\ncould not be checked, every gun that would bear was turned upon her,\r\nand torpedos were exploded in her pathway by electricity. All these she\r\ntreated with the silent contempt they merited from so invulnerable a\r\nmonster. At length, as she reached a good easy range of the fort, her\r\nbow struck something, and she swung around as if to open fire. That was\r\nenough for the Rebels. With Schofield’s army reaching out to cut off\r\ntheir retreat, and this dreadful thing about to tear the insides out of\r\ntheir fort with four-hundred-pound shot at quarter-mile range, there\r\nwas nothing for them to do but consult their own safety, which they did\r\nwith such haste that they did not spike a gun, or destroy a pound of\r\nstores.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXX.\r\n\r\nVISIT TO FORT FISHER, AND INSPECTION OF THAT STRONGHOLD--THE WAY IT WAS\r\nCAPTURED--OUT ON THE OCEAN SAILING--TERRIBLY SEASICK--RAPID RECOVERY\r\n--ARRIVAL AT ANNAPOLIS--WASHED, CLOTHED AND FED--UNBOUNDED LUXURY, AND\r\nDAYS OF UNADULTERATED HAPPINESS.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the mouth of Cape Fear River the wind was blowing so\r\nhard that our Captain did not think it best to venture out, so he cast\r\nanchor. The cabin of the vessel was filled with officers who had been\r\nreleased from prison about the same time we were. I was also given a\r\nberth in the cabin, in consideration of my being the non-commissioned\r\nofficer in charge of the men, and I found the associations quite\r\npleasant. A party was made up, which included me, to visit Fort Fisher,\r\nand we spent the larger part of a day very agreeably in wandering over\r\nthat great stronghold. We found it wonderful in its strength, and\r\nwere prepared to accept the statement of those who had seen foreign\r\ndefensive works, that it was much more powerful than the famous\r\nMalakoff, which so long defied the besiegers of Sebastopol.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the fort was on a narrow and low spit of ground\r\nbetween Cape Fear River and the ocean. On this the Rebels had erected,\r\nwith prodigious labor, an embankment over a mile in length, twenty-five\r\nfeet thick and twenty feet high. About two-thirds of this bank faced\r\nthe sea; the other third ran across the spit of land to protect the\r\nfort against an attack from the land side. Still stronger than the bank\r\nforming the front of the fort were the traverses, which prevented an\r\nenfilading fire These were regular hills, twenty-five to forty feet\r\nhigh, and broad and long in proportion. There were fifteen or twenty\r\nof them along the face of the fort. Inside of them were capacious\r\nbomb proofs, sufficiently large to shelter the whole garrison. It\r\nseemed as if a whole Township had been dug up, carted down there and\r\nset on edge. In front of the works was a strong palisade. Between\r\neach pair of traverses were one or two enormous guns, none less than\r\none-hundred-and-fifty pounders. Among these we saw a great Armstrong\r\ngun, which had been presented to the Southern Confederacy by its\r\nmanufacturer, Sir William Armstrong, who, like the majority of the\r\nEnglish nobility, was a warm admirer of the Jeff. Davis crowd. It was\r\nthe finest piece of ordnance ever seen in this country. The carriage\r\nwas rosewood, and the mountings gilt brass. The breech of the gun had\r\nfive reinforcements.\r\n\r\nTo attack this place our Government assembled the most powerful\r\nfleet ever sent on such an expedition. Over seventy-five men-of-war,\r\nincluding six monitors, and carrying six hundred guns, assailed it\r\nwith a storm of shot and shell that averaged four projectiles per\r\nsecond for several hours; the parapet was battered, and the large guns\r\ncrushed as one smashes a bottle with a stone. The garrison fled into\r\nthe bomb-proofs for protection. The troops, who had landed above the\r\nfort, moved up to assail the land face, while a brigade of sailors and\r\nmarines attacked the sea face.\r\n\r\nAs the fleet had to cease firing to allow the charge, the Rebels ran\r\nout of their casemates and, manning the parapet, opened such a fire\r\nof musketry that the brigade from the fleet was driven back, but the\r\nsoldiers made a lodgment on the land face. Then began some beautiful\r\ncooperative tactics between the Army and Navy, communication being kept\r\nup with signal flags. Our men were on one side of the parapets and the\r\nRebels on the other, with the fighting almost hand-to-hand. The vessels\r\nranged out to where their guns would rake the Rebel line, and as their\r\nshot tore down its length, the Rebels gave way, and falling back to the\r\nnext traverse, renewed the conflict there. Guided by the signals our\r\nvessels changed their positions, so as to rake this line also, and so\r\nthe fight went on until twelve traverses had been carried, one after\r\nthe other, when the rebels surrendered.\r\n\r\nThe next day the Rebels abandoned Fort Caswell and other fortifications\r\nin the immediate neighborhood, surrendered two gunboats, and fell\r\nback to the lines at Fort Anderson. After Fort Fisher fell, several\r\nblockade-runners were lured inside and captured.\r\n\r\nNever before had there been such a demonstration of the power of\r\nheavy artillery. Huge cannon were pounded into fragments, hills of\r\nsand ripped open, deep crevasses blown in the ground by exploding\r\nshells, wooden buildings reduced to kindling-wood, etc. The ground\r\nwas literally paved with fragments of shot and shell, which, now red\r\nwith rust from the corroding salt air, made the interior of the fort\r\nresemble what one of our party likened it to “an old brickyard.”\r\n\r\nWhichever way we looked along the shores we saw abundant evidence of\r\nthe greatness of the business which gave the place its importance. In\r\nall directions, as far as the eye could reach, the beach was dotted\r\nwith the bleaching skeletons of blockade-runners--some run ashore by\r\ntheir mistaking the channel, more beached to escape the hot pursuit of\r\nour blockaders.\r\n\r\nDirectly in front of the sea face of the fort, and not four hundred\r\nyards from the savage mouths of the huge guns, the blackened timbers of\r\na burned blockade-runner showed above the water at low tide. Coming in\r\nfrom Nassau with a cargo of priceless value to the gasping Confederacy,\r\nshe was observed and chased by one of our vessels, a swifter sailer,\r\neven, than herself. The war ship closed rapidly upon her. She sought\r\nthe protection of the guns of Fort Fisher, which opened venomously on\r\nthe chaser. They did not stop her, though they were less than half a\r\nmile away. In another minute she would have sent the Rebel vessel to\r\nthe bottom of the sea, by a broadside from her heavy guns, but the\r\nCaptain of the latter turned her suddenly, and ran her high up on the\r\nbeach, wrecking his vessel, but saving the much more valuable cargo.\r\nOur vessel then hauled off, and as night fell, quiet was restored. At\r\nmidnight two boat-loads of determined men, rowing with muffled oars\r\nmoved silently out from the blockader towards the beached vessel.\r\nIn their boats they had some cans of turpentine, and several large\r\nshells. When they reached the blockade-runner they found all her crew\r\ngone ashore, save one watchman, whom they overpowered before he could\r\ngive the alarm. They cautiously felt their way around, with the aid of\r\na dark lantern, secured the ship’s chronometer, her papers and some\r\nother desired objects. They then saturated with the turpentine piles of\r\ncombustible material, placed about the vessel to the best advantage,\r\nand finished by depositing the shells where their explosion would ruin\r\nthe machinery. All this was done so near to the fort that the sentinels\r\non the parapets could be heard with the greatest distinctness as they\r\nrepeated their half-hourly cry of “All’s well.” Their preparations\r\ncompleted, the daring fellows touched matches to the doomed vessel in a\r\ndozen places at once, and sprang into their boats. The flames instantly\r\nenveloped the ship, and showed the gunners the incendiaries rowing\r\nrapidly away. A hail of shot beat the water into a foam around the\r\nboats, but their good fortune still attended them, and they got back\r\nwithout losing a man.\r\n\r\nThe wind at length calmed sufficiently to encourage our Captain to\r\nventure out, and we were soon battling with the rolling waves, far out\r\nof sight of land. For awhile the novelty of the scene fascinated me.\r\nI was at last on the ocean, of which I had heard, read and imagined\r\nso much. The creaking cordage, the straining engine, the plunging\r\nship, the wild waste of tumbling billows, everyone apparently racing\r\nto where our tossing bark was struggling to maintain herself, all had\r\nan entrancing interest for me, and I tried to recall Byron’s sublime\r\napostrophe to the ocean:\r\n\r\n          Thou glorious mirror, where the Almighty’s form\r\n          Classes itself in tempest: in all time,\r\n          Calm or convulsed-in breeze, or gale, or storm,\r\n          Icing the pole, or in the torrid clime\r\n          Dark-heaving--boundless, endless, and sublime--\r\n          The image of eternity--the throne\r\n          Of the invisible; even from out thy slime\r\n          The monsters of the deep are made; each zone\r\n          Obey thee: thou goest forth, dread, fathomless, alone,\r\n\r\nJust then, my reverie was broken by the strong hand of the gruff\r\nCaptain of, the vessel descending upon my shoulder, and he said:\r\n\r\n“See, here, youngster! Ain’t you the fellow that was put in command of\r\nthese men?”\r\n\r\nI acknowledged such to be the case.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the Captain; “I want you to ’tend to your business and\r\nstraighten them around, so that we can clean off the decks.”\r\n\r\nI turned from the bulwark over which I had been contemplating the vasty\r\ndeep, and saw the sorriest, most woe-begone lot that the imagination\r\ncan conceive. Every mother’s son was wretchedly sea-sick. They were\r\npaying the penalty of their overfeeding in Wilmington; and every face\r\nlooked as if its owner was discovering for the first time what the real\r\nlower depths of human misery was. They all seemed afraid they would not\r\ndie; as if they were praying for death, but feeling certain that he was\r\ngoing back on them in a most shameful way.\r\n\r\nWe straightened them around a little, washed them and the decks off\r\nwith a hose, and then I started down in the hold to see how matters\r\nwere with the six hundred down there. The boys there were much sicker\r\nthan those on deck. As I lifted the hatch there rose an odor which\r\nappeared strong enough to raise the plank itself. Every onion that\r\nhad been issued to us in Wilmington seemed to lie down there in the\r\nlast stages of decomposition. All of the seventy distinct smells which\r\nColeridge counted at Cologne might have been counted in any given\r\ncubic foot of atmosphere, while the next foot would have an entirely\r\ndifferent and equally demonstrative “bouquet.”\r\n\r\nI recoiled, and leaned against the bulwark, but soon summoned up\r\ncourage enough to go half-way down the ladder, and shout out in as\r\nstern a tone as I could command:\r\n\r\n“Here, now! I want you fellows to straighten around there, right off,\r\nand help clean up!”\r\n\r\nThey were as angry and cross as they were sick. They wanted nothing in\r\nthe world so much as the opportunity I had given them to swear at and\r\nabuse somebody. Every one of them raised on his elbow, and shaking his\r\nfist at me yelled out:\r\n\r\n“O, you go to ----, you ---- ---- ----. Just come down another step,\r\nand I’ll knock the whole head off ’en you.”\r\n\r\nI did not go down any farther.\r\n\r\nComing back on the deck my stomach began to feel qualmish. Some\r\nwretched idiot, whose grandfather’s grave I hope the jackasses have\r\ndefiled, as the Turks would say, told me that the best preventive of\r\nsea-sickness was to drink as much of the milk punch as I could swallow.\r\n\r\nLike another idiot, I did so.\r\n\r\nI went again to the side of the vessel, but now the fascination of the\r\nscene had all faded out. The restless billows were dreary, savage,\r\nhungry and dizzying; they seemed to claw at, and tear, and wrench\r\nthe struggling ship as a group of huge lions would tease and worry a\r\ncaptive dog. They distressed her and all on board by dealing a blow\r\nwhich would send her reeling in one direction, but before she had swung\r\nthe full length that impulse would have sent her, catching her on the\r\nopposite side with a stunning shock that sent her another way, only to\r\nmeet another rude buffet from still another side.\r\n\r\nI thought we could all have stood it if the motion had been like that\r\nof a swing-backward and forward--or even if the to and fro motion had\r\nbeen complicated with a side-wise swing, but to be put through every\r\npossible bewildering motion in the briefest space of time was more than\r\nheads of iron and stomachs of brass could stand.\r\n\r\nMine were not made of such perdurable stuff.\r\n\r\nThey commenced mutinous demonstrations in regard to the milk punch.\r\n\r\nI began wondering whether the milk was not the horrible beer swill,\r\nstump-tail kind of which I had heard so much.\r\n\r\nAnd the whisky in it; to use a vigorous Westernism, descriptive of mean\r\nwhisky, it seemed to me that I could smell the boy’s feet who plowed\r\nthe corn from which it was distilled.\r\n\r\nThen the onions I had eaten in Wilmington began to rebel, and incite\r\nthe bread, meat and coffee to gastric insurrection, and I became so\r\nutterly wretched that life had no farther attractions.\r\n\r\nWhile I was leaning over the bulwark, musing on the complete hollowness\r\nof all earthly things, the Captain of the vessel caught hold of me\r\nroughly, and said:\r\n\r\n“Look here, you’re just playin’ the very devil a-commandin’ these here\r\nmen. Why in ---- don’t you stiffen up, and hump yourself around, and\r\nmake these men mind, or else belt them over the head with a capstan\r\nbar! Now I want you to ’tend to your business. D’you understand me?”\r\n\r\nI turned a pair of weary and hopeless eyes upon him, and started to say\r\nthat a man who would talk to one in my forlorn condition of “stiffening\r\nup,” and “belting other fellows over the head with a capstan bar,”\r\nwould insult a woman dying with consumption, but I suddenly became too\r\nfull for utterance.\r\n\r\nThe milk punch, the onions, the bread, and meat and coffee tired of\r\nfighting it out in the narrow quarters where I had stowed them, had\r\nstarted upwards tumultuously.\r\n\r\nI turned my head again to the sea, and looking down into its smaragdine\r\ndepths, let go of the victualistic store which I had been industriously\r\naccumulating ever since I had come through the lines.\r\n\r\nI vomited until I felt as empty and hollow as a stove pipe. There\r\nwas a vacuum that extended clear to my toe-nails. I feared that\r\nevery retching struggle would dent me in, all over, as one sees tin\r\npreserving cans crushed in by outside pressure, and I apprehended that\r\nif I kept on much longer my shoe-soles would come up after the rest.\r\n\r\nI will mention, parenthetically, that, to this day I abhor milk punch,\r\nand also onions.\r\n\r\nUnutterably miserable as I was I could not refrain from a ghost of a\r\nsmile, when a poor country boy near me sang out in an interval between\r\nvomiting spells:\r\n\r\n“O, Captain, for God’s sake, stop the boat and lem’me go ashore, and I\r\nswear I’ll walk every step of the way home.”\r\n\r\nHe was like old Gonzalo in the ‘Tempest:’\r\n\r\n     Now world I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren\r\n     ground; long heath; brown furze; anything. The wills above be done!\r\n     but I would fain die a dry death.\r\n\r\nAfter this misery had lasted about two days we got past Cape Hatteras,\r\nand out of reach of its malign influence, and recovered as rapidly as\r\nwe had been prostrated.\r\n\r\nWe regained spirits and appetites with amazing swiftness; the sun came\r\nout warm and cheerful, we cleaned up our quarters and ourselves as best\r\nwe could, and during the remainder of the voyage were as blithe and\r\ncheerful as so many crickets.\r\n\r\nThe fun in the cabin was rollicking. The officers had been as sick as\r\nthe men, but were wonderfully vivacious when the ‘mal du mer’ passed\r\noff. In the party was a fine glee club, which had been organized at\r\n“Camp Sorgum,” the officers’ prison at Columbia. Its leader was a Major\r\nof the Fifth Iowa Cavalry, who possessed a marvelously sweet tenor\r\nvoice, and well developed musical powers. While we were at Wilmington\r\nhe sang “When Sherman Marched Down to the Sea,” to an audience of\r\nsoldiers that packed the Opera House densely.\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm he aroused was simply indescribable; men shouted, and\r\nthe tears ran down their faces. He was recalled time and again, each\r\ntime with an increase in the furore. The audience would have staid\r\nthere all night to listen to him sing that one song. Poor fellow, he\r\nonly went home to die. An attack of pneumonia carried him off within a\r\nfortnight after we separated at Annapolis.\r\n\r\nThe Glee Club had several songs which they rendered in regular negro\r\nminstrel style, and in a way that was irresistibly ludicrous. One of\r\ntheir favorites was “Billy Patterson.” All standing up in a ring, the\r\ntenors would lead off:\r\n\r\n          “I saw an old man go riding by,”\r\n\r\nand the baritones, flinging themselves around with the looseness of\r\nChristy’s Minstrels, in a “break down,” would reply:\r\n\r\n          “Don’t tell me! Don’t tell me!”\r\n\r\nThen the tenors would resume:\r\n\r\n          “Says I, Ole man, your horse’ll die.”\r\n\r\nThen the baritones, with an air of exaggerated interest;\r\n\r\n          “A-ha-a-a, Billy Patterson!”\r\n\r\nTenors:\r\n\r\n          “For. It he dies, I’ll tan his skin;\r\n          An’ if he lives I’ll ride him agin,”\r\n\r\nAll-together, with a furious “break down” at the close:\r\n\r\n          “Then I’ll lay five dollars down,\r\n          And count them one by one;\r\n          Then I’ll lay five dollars down,\r\n          If anybody will show me the man\r\n          That struck Billy Patterson.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so on. It used to upset my gravity entirely to see a crowd of\r\ngrave and dignified Captains, Majors and Colonels going through this\r\nnonsensical drollery with all the abandon of professional burnt-cork\r\nartists.\r\n\r\nAs we were nearing the entrance to Chesapeake Bay we passed a great\r\nmonitor, who was exercising her crew at the guns. She fired directly\r\nacross our course, the huge four hundred pound balls shipping along\r\nthe water, about a mile ahead of us, as we boys used to make the flat\r\nstones skip in the play of “Ducks and Drakes.” One or two of the shots\r\ncame so. close that I feared she might be mistaking us for a Rebel ship\r\nintent on some raid up the Bay, and I looked up anxiously to see that\r\nthe flag should float out so conspicuously that she could not help\r\nseeing it.\r\n\r\nThe next day our vessel ran alongside of the dock at the Naval Academy\r\nat Annapolis, that institution now being used as a hospital for paroled\r\nprisoners. The musicians of the Post band came down with stretchers\r\nto carry the sick to the Hospital, while those of us who were able\r\nto walk were ordered to fall in and march up. The distance was but a\r\nfew hundred yards. On reaching the building we marched up on a little\r\nbalcony, and as we did so each one of us was seized by a hospital\r\nattendant, who, with the quick dexterity attained by long practice,\r\nsnatched every one of our filthy, lousy rags off in the twinkling of an\r\neye, and flung them over the railing to the ground, where a man loaded\r\nthem into a wagon with a pitchfork.\r\n\r\nWith them went our faithful little black can, our hoop-iron spoon, and\r\nour chessboard and men.\r\n\r\nThus entirely denuded, each boy was given a shove which sent him into a\r\nlittle room, where a barber pressed him down upon a stool, and almost\r\nbefore he understood what was being done, had his hair and beard cut\r\noff as close as shears would do it. Another tap on the back sent the\r\nshorn lamb into a room furnished with great tubs of water and with\r\nabout six inches of soap suds on the zinc-covered floor.\r\n\r\nIn another minute two men with sponges had removed every trace of\r\nprison grime from his body, and passed him on to two more men, who\r\nwiped him dry, and moved him on to where a man handed him a new shirt,\r\na pair of drawers, pair of socks, pair of pantaloons, pair of slippers,\r\nand a hospital gown, and motioned him to go on into the large room,\r\nand array himself in his new garments. Like everything else about the\r\nHospital this performance was reduced to a perfect system. Not a word\r\nwas spoken by anybody, not a moment’s time lost, and it seemed to me\r\nthat it was not ten minutes after I marched up on the balcony, covered\r\nwith dirt, rags, vermin, and a matted shock of hair, until I marched\r\nout of the room, clean and well clothed. Now I began to feel as if I\r\nwas really a man again.\r\n\r\nThe next thing done was to register our names, rank, regiment, when\r\nand where captured, when and where released. After this we were shown\r\nto our rooms. And such rooms as they were. All the old maids in the\r\ncountry could not have improved their spick-span neatness. The floors\r\nwere as white as pine plank could be scoured; the sheets and bedding\r\nas clean as cotton and linen and woolen could be washed. Nothing in\r\nany home in the land was any more daintily, wholesomely, unqualifiedly\r\nclean than were these little chambers, each containing two beds, one\r\nfor each man assigned to their occupancy.\r\n\r\nAndrews doubted if we could stand all this radical change in our\r\nhabits. He feared that it was rushing things too fast. We might have\r\nhad our hair cut one week, and taken a bath all over a week later, and\r\nso progress down to sleeping between white sheets in the course of six\r\nmonths, but to do it all in one day seemed like tempting fate.\r\n\r\nEvery turn showed us some new feature of the marvelous order of this\r\nwonderful institution. Shortly after we were sent to our rooms, a\r\nSurgeon entered with a Clerk. After answering the usual questions as\r\nto name, rank, company and regiment, the Surgeon examined our tongues,\r\neyes, limbs and general appearance, and communicated his conclusions\r\nto the Clerk, who filled out a blank card. This card was stuck into\r\na little tin holder at the head of my bed. Andrews’s card was the\r\nsame, except the name. The Surgeon was followed by a Sergeant, who\r\nwas Chief of the Dining-Room, and the Clerk, who made a minute of the\r\ndiet ordered for us, and moved off. Andrews and I immediately became\r\nvery solicitous to know what species of diet No. 1 was. After the\r\nseasickness left us our appetites became as ravenous as a buzz-saw,\r\nand unless Diet No. 1 was more than No. 1 in name, it would not fill\r\nthe bill. We had not long to remain in suspense, for soon another\r\nnon-commissioned officer passed through at the head of a train of\r\nattendants, bearing trays. Consulting the list in his hand, he said to\r\none of his followers, “Two No. 1’s,” and that satellite set down two\r\nlarge plates, upon each of which were a cup of coffee, a shred of meat,\r\ntwo boiled eggs and a couple of rolls.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Andrews, as the procession moved away, “I want to know\r\nwhere this thing’s going to stop. I am trying hard to get used to\r\nwearing a shirt without any lice in it, and to sitting down on a chair,\r\nand to sleeping in a clean bed, but when it comes to having my meals\r\nsent to my room, I’m afraid I’ll degenerate into a pampered child of\r\nluxury. They are really piling it on too strong. Let us see, Mc.; how\r\nlong’s it been since we were sitting on the sand there in Florence,\r\nboiling our pint of meal in that old can?”\r\n\r\n“It seems many years, Lale,” I said; “but for heaven’s sake let us try\r\nto forget it as soon as possible. We will always remember too much of\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nAnd we did try hard to make the miserable recollections fade out of our\r\nminds. When we were stripped on the balcony we threw away every visible\r\ntoken that could remind us of the hateful experience we had passed\r\nthrough. We did not retain a scrap of paper or a relic to recall the\r\nunhappy past. We loathed everything connected with it.\r\n\r\nThe days that followed were very happy ones. The Paymaster came around\r\nand paid us each two months’ pay and twenty-five cents a day “ration\r\nmoney” for every day we had been in prison. This gave Andrews and\r\nI about one hundred and sixty-five dollars apiece--an abundance of\r\nspending money. Uncle Sam was very kind and considerate to his soldier\r\nnephews, and the Hospital authorities neglected nothing that would add\r\nto our comfort. The superbly-kept grounds of the Naval Academy were\r\nrenewing the freshness of their loveliness under the tender wooing\r\nof the advancing Spring, and every step one sauntered through them\r\nwas a new delight. A magnificent band gave us sweet music morning and\r\nevening. Every dispatch from the South told of the victorious progress\r\nof our arms, and the rapid approach of the close of the struggle. All\r\nwe had to do was to enjoy the goods the gods were showering upon us,\r\nand we did so with appreciative, thankful hearts. After awhile all\r\nable to travel were given furloughs of thirty days to visit their\r\nhomes, with instructions to report at the expiration of their leaves\r\nof absence to the camps of rendezvous nearest their homes, and we\r\nseparated, nearly every man going in a different direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXI.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN WIRZ THE ONLY ONE OF THE PRISON-KEEPERS PUNISHED--HIS ARREST,\r\nTRIAL AND EXECUTION.\r\n\r\nOf all those more or less concerned in the barbarities practiced\r\nupon our prisoners, but one--Captain Henry Wirz--was punished. The\r\nTurners, at Richmond; Lieutenant Boisseux, of Belle Isle; Major Gee,\r\nof Salisbury; Colonel Iverson and Lieutenant Barrett, of Florence; and\r\nthe many brutal miscreants about Andersonville, escaped scot free. What\r\nbecame of them no one knows; they were never heard of after the close\r\nof the war. They had sense enough to retire into obscurity, and stay\r\nthere, and this saved their lives, for each one of them had made deadly\r\nenemies among those whom they had maltreated, who, had they known where\r\nthey were, would have walked every step of the way thither to kill them.\r\n\r\nWhen the Confederacy went to pieces in April, 1865, Wirz was still\r\nat Andersonville. General Wilson, commanding our cavalry forces, and\r\nwho had established his headquarters at Macon, Ga., learned of this,\r\nand sent one of his staff--Captain H. E. Noyes, of the Fourth Regular\r\nCavalry --with a squad. of men, to arrest him. This was done on the\r\n7th of May. Wirz protested against his arrest, claiming that he was\r\nprotected by the terms of Johnson’s surrender, and, addressed the\r\nfollowing letter to General Wilson:\r\n\r\n                              ANDERSONVILLE, GA., May 7, 1865.\r\n\r\nGENERAL:--It is with great reluctance that I address you these lines,\r\nbeing fully aware how little time is left you to attend to such matters\r\nas I now have the honor to lay before you, and if I could see any other\r\nway to accomplish my object I would not intrude upon you. I am a native\r\nof Switzerland, and was before the war a citizen of Louisiana, and by\r\nprofession a physician. Like hundreds and thousands of others, I was\r\ncarried away by the maelstrom of excitement and joined the Southern\r\narmy. I was very severely wounded at the battle of “Seven Pines,” near\r\nRichmond, Va., and have nearly lost the use of my right arm. Unfit for\r\nfield duty, I was ordered to report to Brevet Major General John H.\r\nWinder, in charge of the Federal prisoners of war, who ordered me to\r\ntake charge of a prison in Tuscaloosa, Ala. My health failing me, I\r\napplied for a furlough and went to Europe, from whence I returned in\r\nFebruary, 1864. I was then ordered to report to the commandant of the\r\nmilitary prison at Andersonville, Ga., who assigned me to the command\r\nof the interior of the prison. The duties I had to perform were arduous\r\nand unpleasant, and I am satisfied that no man can or will justly\r\nblame me for things that happened here, and which were beyond my power\r\nto control. I do not think that I ought to be held responsible for\r\nthe shortness of rations, for the overcrowded state of the prison,\r\n(which was of itself a prolific source of fearful mortality), for the\r\ninadequate supply of clothing, want of shelter, etc., etc. Still I\r\nnow bear the odium, and men who were prisoners have seemed disposed\r\nto wreak their vengeance upon me for what they have suffered--I, who\r\nwas only the medium, or, I may better say, the tool in the hands of my\r\nsuperiors. This is my condition. I am a man with a family. I lost all\r\nmy property when the Federal army besieged Vicksburg. I have no money\r\nat present to go to any place, and, even if I had, I know of no place\r\nwhere I can go. My life is in danger, and I most respectfully ask of\r\nyou help and relief. If you will be so generous as to give me some sort\r\nof a safe conduct, or, what I should greatly prefer, a guard to protect\r\nmyself and family against violence, I should be thankful to you, and\r\nyou may rest assured that your protection will not be given to one who\r\nis unworthy of it. My intention is to return with my family to Europe,\r\nas soon as I can make the arrangements. In the meantime I have the\r\nhonor General, to remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                        Hy. WIRZ, Captain C. S. A.\r\nMajor General T. H. WILSON,\r\nCommanding, Macon. Ga.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was kept at Macon, under guard, until May 20, when Captain Noyes\r\nwas ordered to take him, and the hospital records of Andersonville,\r\nto Washington. Between Macon and Cincinnati the journey was a perfect\r\ngauntlet.\r\n\r\nOur men were stationed all along the road, and among them everywhere\r\nwere ex-prisoners, who recognized Wirz, and made such determined\r\nefforts to kill him that it was all that Captain Noyes, backed by a\r\nstrong guard, could do to frustrate them. At Chattanooga and Nashville\r\nthe struggle between his guards and his would-be slayers, was quite\r\nsharp.\r\n\r\nAt Louisville, Noyes had Wirz clean-shaved, and dressed in a complete\r\nsuit of black, with a beaver hat, which so altered his appearance that\r\nno one recognized him after that, and the rest of the journey was made\r\nunmolested.\r\n\r\nThe authorities at Washington ordered that he be tried immediately,\r\nby a court martial composed of Generals Lewis Wallace, Mott, Geary,\r\nL. Thomas, Fessenden, Bragg and Baller, Colonel Allcock, and\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Stibbs. Colonel Chipman was Judge Advocate, and the\r\ntrial began August 23.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner was arraigned on a formidable list of charges and\r\nspecifications, which accused him of “combining, confederating, and\r\nconspiring together with John H. Winder, Richard B. Winder, Isaiah\r\nII. White, W. S. Winder, R. R. Stevenson and others unknown, to\r\ninjure the health and destroy the lives of soldiers in the military\r\nservice of the United States, there held, and being prisoners of war\r\nwithin the lines of the so-called Confederate States, and in the\r\nmilitary prisons thereof, to the end that the armies of the United\r\nStates might be weakened and impaired, in violation of the laws and\r\ncustoms of war.” The main facts of the dense over-crowding, the lack\r\nof sufficient shelter, the hideous mortality were cited, and to these\r\nadded a long list of specific acts of brutality, such as hunting men\r\ndown with hounds, tearing them with dogs, robbing them, confining them\r\nin the stocks, cruelly beating and murdering them, of which Wirz was\r\npersonally guilty.\r\n\r\nWhen the defendant was called upon to plead he claimed that his case\r\nwas covered by the terms of Johnston’s surrender, and furthermore, that\r\nthe country now being at peace, he could not be lawfully tried by a\r\ncourt-martial. These objections being overruled, he entered a plea of\r\nnot guilty to all the charges and specifications. He had two lawyers\r\nfor counsel.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution called Captain Noyes first, who detailed the\r\ncircumstances of Wirz’s arrest, and denied that he had given any\r\npromises of protection.\r\n\r\nThe next witness was Colonel George C. Gibbs, who commanded the\r\ntroops of the post at Andersonville. He testified that Wirz was the\r\ncommandant of the prison, and had sole authority under Winder over all\r\nthe prisoners; that there was a Dead Line there, and orders to shoot\r\nany one who crossed it; that dogs were kept to hunt down escaping\r\nprisoners; the dogs were the ordinary plantation dogs, mixture of hound\r\nand cur.\r\n\r\nDr. J. C. Bates, who was a Surgeon of the Prison Hospital, (a Rebel),\r\ntestified that the condition of things in his division was horrible.\r\nNearly naked men, covered with lice, were dying on all sides. Many were\r\nlying in the filthy sand and mud.\r\n\r\nHe went on and described the terrible condition of men--dying from\r\nscurvy, diarrhea, gangrenous sores, and lice. He wanted to carry in\r\nfresh vegetables for the sick, but did not dare, the orders being very\r\nstrict against such thing. He thought the prison authorities might\r\neasily have sent in enough green corn to have stopped the scurvy;\r\nthe miasmatic effluvia from the prison was exceedingly offensive and\r\npoisonous, so much so that when the surgeons received a slight scratch\r\non their persons, they carefully covered it up with court plaster,\r\nbefore venturing near the prison.\r\n\r\nA number of other Rebel Surgeons testified to substantially the same\r\nfacts. Several residents of that section of the State testified to the\r\nplentifulness of the crops there in 1864.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these, about one hundred and fifty Union prisoners were\r\nexamined, who testified to all manner of barbarities which had come\r\nunder their personal observation. They had all seen Wirz shoot men, had\r\nseen him knock sick and crippled men down and stamp upon them, had been\r\nrun down by him with hounds, etc. Their testimony occupies about two\r\nthousand pages of manuscript, and is, without doubt, the most, terrible\r\nrecord of crime ever laid to the account of any man.\r\n\r\nThe taking of this testimony occupied until October 18, when the\r\nGovernment decided to close the case, as any further evidence would be\r\nsimply cumulative.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner presented a statement in which he denied that there had\r\nbeen an accomplice in a conspiracy of John H. Winder and others, to\r\ndestroy the lives of United States soldiers; he also denied that there\r\nhad been such a conspiracy, but made the pertinent inquiry why he\r\nalone, of all those who were charged with the conspiracy, was brought\r\nto trial. He said that Winder has gone to the great judgment seat, to\r\nanswer for all his thoughts, words and deeds, “and surely I am not to\r\nbe held culpable for them. General Howell Cobb has received the pardon\r\nof the President of the United States.” He further claimed that there\r\nwas no principle of law which would sanction the holding of him--a mere\r\nsubordinate --guilty, for simply obeying, as literally as possible, the\r\norders of his superiors.\r\n\r\nHe denied all the specific acts of cruelty alleged against him, such\r\nas maltreating and killing prisoners with his own hands. The prisoners\r\nkilled for crossing the Dead Line, he claimed, should not be charged\r\nagainst him, since they were simply punished for the violation of a\r\nknown order which formed part of the discipline, he believed, of all\r\nmilitary prisons. The statement that soldiers were given a furlough\r\nfor killing a Yankee prisoner, was declared to be “a mere idle, absurd\r\ncamp rumor.” As to the lack of shelter, room and rations for so many\r\nprisoners, he claimed that the sole responsibility rested upon the\r\nConfederate Government. There never were but two prisoners whipped by\r\nhis order, and these were for sufficient cause. He asked the Court to\r\nconsider favorably two important items in his defense: first, that he\r\nhad of his own accord taken the drummer boys from the Stockade, and\r\nplaced them where they could get purer air and better food. Second,\r\nthat no property taken from prisoners was retained by him, but was\r\nturned over to the Prison Quartermaster.\r\n\r\nThe Court, after due deliberation, declared the prisoner guilty on all\r\nthe charges and specifications save two unimportant ones, and sentenced\r\nhim to be hanged by the neck until dead, at such time and place as the\r\nPresident of the United States should direct.\r\n\r\nNovember 3 President Johnson approved of the sentence, and ordered\r\nMajor General C. C. Augur to carry the same into effect on Friday,\r\nNovember 10, which was done. The prisoner made frantic appeals against\r\nthe sentence; he wrote imploring letters to President Johnson, and\r\nlying ones to the New York News, a Rebel paper. It is said that his\r\nwife attempted to convey poison to him, that he might commit suicide\r\nand avoid the ignomy of being hanged. When all hope was gone he nerved\r\nhimself up to meet his fate, and died, as thousands of other scoundrels\r\nhave, with calmness. His body was buried in the grounds of the Old\r\nCapitol Prison, alongside of that of Azterodt, one of the accomplices\r\nin the assassination of President Lincoln.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXII.\r\n\r\nTHE RESPONSIBILITY--WHO WAS TO BLAME FOR ALL THE MISERY--AN EXAMINATION\r\nOF THE FLIMSY EXCUSES MADE FOR THE REBELS--ONE DOCUMENT THAT CONVICTS\r\nTHEM--WHAT IS DESIRED.\r\n\r\nI have endeavored to tell the foregoing story as calmly, as\r\ndispassionately, as free from vituperation and prejudice as possible.\r\nHow well I have succeeded the reader must judge. How difficult this\r\nmoderation has been at times only those know who, like myself, have\r\nseen, from day to day, the treason-sharpened fangs of Starvation and\r\nDisease gnaw nearer and nearer to the hearts of well-beloved friends\r\nand comrades. Of the sixty-three of my company comrades who entered\r\nprison with me, but eleven, or at most thirteen, emerged alive,\r\nand several of these have since died from the effects of what they\r\nsuffered. The mortality in the other companies of our battalion was\r\nequally great, as it was also with the prisoners generally. Not less\r\nthan twenty-five thousand gallant, noble-hearted boys died around me\r\nbetween the dates of my capture and release. Nobler men than they\r\nnever died for any cause. For the most part they were simple-minded,\r\nhonest-hearted boys; the sterling products of our Northern home-life,\r\nand Northern Common Schools, and that grand stalwart Northern blood,\r\nthe yeoman blood of sturdy middle class freemen--the blood of the\r\nrace which has conquered on every field since the Roman Empire went\r\ndown under its sinewy blows. They prated little of honor, and knew\r\nnothing of “chivalry” except in its repulsive travesty in the South.\r\nAs citizens at home, no honest labor had been regarded by them as too\r\nhumble to be followed with manly pride in its success; as soldiers\r\nin the field, they did their duty with a calm defiance of danger and\r\ndeath, that the world has not seen equaled in the six thousand years\r\nthat men have followed the trade of war. In the prison their conduct\r\nwas marked by the same unostentatious but unflinching heroism. Death\r\nstared them in the face constantly. They could read their own fate in\r\nthat of the loathsome, unburied dead all around them. Insolent enemies\r\nmocked their sufferings, and sneered at their devotion to a Government\r\nwhich they asserted had abandoned them, but the simple faith, the\r\ningrained honesty of these plain-mannered, plain-spoken boys rose\r\nsuperior to every trial. Brutus, the noblest Roman of them all, says in\r\nhis grandest flight:\r\n\r\n          Set honor in one eye and death in the other,\r\n          And I will look on both indifferently.\r\n\r\nThey did not say this: they did it. They never questioned their duty; no\r\nrepinings, no murmurings against their Government escaped their lips,\r\nthey took the dread fortunes brought to them as calmly, as unshrinkingly\r\nas they had those in the field; they quailed not, nor wavered in their\r\nfaith before the worst the Rebels could do. The finest epitaph ever\r\ninscribed above a soldier’s grave was that graven on the stone which\r\nmarked the resting-place of the deathless three hundred who fell at\r\nThermopylae:\r\n\r\n          Go, stranger, to Lacedaemon,--\r\n          And tell Sparta that we lie here in obedience to her laws.\r\n\r\nThey who lie in the shallow graves of Andersonville, Belle Isle,\r\nFlorence and Salisbury, lie there in obedience to the precepts\r\nand maxims inculcated into their minds in the churches and Common\r\nSchools of the North; precepts which impressed upon them the duty of\r\nmanliness and honor in all the relations and exigencies of life; not\r\nthe “chivalric” prate of their enemies, but the calm steadfastness\r\nwhich endureth to the end. The highest tribute that can be paid them\r\nis to say they did full credit to their teachings, and they died as\r\nevery American should when duty bids him. No richer heritage was ever\r\nbequeathed to posterity.\r\n\r\nIt was in the year 1864, and the first three months of 1865 that these\r\ntwenty-five thousand youths mere cruelly and needlessly done to death.\r\nIn these fatal fifteen months more young men than to-day form the\r\npride, the hope, and the vigor of any one of our leading Cities, more\r\nthan at the beginning of the war were found in either of several States\r\nin the Nation, were sent to their graves, “unknelled, uncoffined,\r\nand unknown,” victims of the most barbarous and unnecessary cruelty\r\nrecorded since the Dark Ages. Barbarous, because the wit of man has not\r\nyet devised a more savage method of destroying fellow-beings than by\r\nexposure and starvation; unnecessary, because the destruction of these\r\nhad not, and could not have the slightest effect upon the result of the\r\nstruggle. The Rebel leaders have acknowledged that they knew the fate\r\nof the Confederacy was sealed when the campaign of 1864 opened with the\r\nNorth displaying an unflinching determination to prosecute the war to\r\na successful conclusion. All that they could hope for after that was\r\nsome fortuitous accident, or unexpected foreign recognition that would\r\ngive them peace with victory. The prisoners were non-important factors\r\nin the military problem. Had they all been turned loose as soon as\r\ncaptured, their efforts would not have hastened the Confederacy’s fate\r\na single day.\r\n\r\nAs to the responsibility for this monstrous cataclysm of human misery\r\nand death: That the great mass of the Southern people approved of these\r\noutrages, or even knew of them, I do not, for an instant, believe.\r\nThey are as little capable of countenancing such a thing as any people\r\nin the world. But the crowning blemish of Southern society has ever\r\nbeen the dumb acquiescence of the many respectable, well-disposed,\r\nright-thinking people in the acts of the turbulent and unscrupulous\r\nfew. From this direful spring has flowed an Iliad of unnumbered woes,\r\nnot only to that section but to our common country. It was this that\r\nkept the South vibrating between patriotism and treason during the\r\nrevolution, so that it cost more lives and treasure to maintain the\r\nstruggle there than in all the rest of the country. It was this that\r\nthreatened the dismemberment of the Union in 1832. It was this that\r\naggravated and envenomed every wrong growing out of Slavery; that\r\noutraged liberty, debauched citizenship, plundered the mails, gagged\r\nthe press, stiffled speech, made opinion a crime, polluted the free\r\nsoil of God with the unwilling step of the bondman, and at last crowned\r\nthree-quarters of a century of this unparalleled iniquity by dragging\r\neleven millions of people into a war from which their souls revolted,\r\nand against which they had declared by overwhelming majorities in\r\nevery State except South Carolina, where the people had no voice. It\r\nmay puzzle some to understand how a relatively small band of political\r\ndesperados in each State could accomplish such a momentous wrong;\r\nthat they did do it, no one conversant with our history will deny,\r\nand that they--insignificant as they were in numbers, in abilities,\r\nin character, in everything save capacity and indomitable energy in\r\nmischief--could achieve such gigantic wrongs in direct opposition to\r\nthe better sense of their communities is a fearful demonstration of the\r\ndefects of the constitution of Southern society.\r\n\r\nMen capable of doing all that the Secession leaders were guilty\r\nof--both before and during the war--were quite capable of revengefully\r\ndestroying twenty-five thousand of their enemies by the most hideous\r\nmeans at their command. That they did so set about destroying\r\ntheir enemies, wilfully, maliciously, and with malice prepense and\r\naforethought, is susceptible of proof as conclusive as that which in a\r\ncriminal court sends murderers to the gallows.\r\n\r\nLet us examine some of these proofs:\r\n\r\n1. The terrible mortality at Andersonville and elsewhere was a matter\r\nof as much notoriety throughout the Southern Confederacy as the\r\nmilitary operations of Lee and Johnson. No intelligent man--much less\r\nthe Rebel leaders--was ignorant of it nor of its calamitous proportions.\r\n\r\n2. Had the Rebel leaders within a reasonable time after this matter\r\nbecame notorious made some show of inquiring into and alleviating\r\nthe deadly misery, there might be some excuse for them on the\r\nground of lack of information, and the plea that they did as well\r\nas they could would have some validity. But this state of affairs\r\nwas allowed to continue over a year--in fact until the downfall of\r\nthe Confederacy--without a hand being raised to mitigate the horrors\r\nof those places--without even an inquiry being made as to whether\r\nthey were mitigable or not. Still worse: every month saw the horrors\r\nthicken, and the condition of the prisoners become more wretched.\r\n\r\nThe suffering in May, 1864, was more terrible than in April; June\r\nshowed a frightful increase over May, while words fail to paint the\r\nhorrors of July and August, and so the wretchedness waxed until the\r\nend, in April, 1865.\r\n\r\n3. The main causes of suffering and death were so obviously preventible\r\nthat the Rebel leaders could not have been ignorant of the ease with\r\nwhich a remedy could be applied. These main causes were three in number:\r\n\r\na. Improper and insufficient food. b. Unheard-of crowding together. c.\r\nUtter lack of shelter.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say which of these three was the most deadly. Let us\r\nadmit, for the sake of argument, that it was impossible for the Rebels\r\nto supply sufficient and proper food. This admission, I know, will not\r\nstand for an instant in the face of the revelations made by Sherman’s\r\nMarch to the Sea; and through the Carolinas, but let that pass, that we\r\nmay consider more easily demonstrable facts connected with the next two\r\npropositions, the first of which is as to the crowding together. Was\r\nland so scarce in the Southern Confederacy that no more than sixteen\r\nacres could be spared for the use of thirty-five thousand prisoners?\r\nThe State of Georgia has a population of less than one-sixth that of\r\nNew York, scattered over a territory one-quarter greater than that\r\nState’s, and yet a pitiful little tract--less than the corn-patch\r\n“clearing” of the laziest “cracker” in the State--was all that could\r\nbe allotted to the use of three-and-a-half times ten thousand young\r\nmen! The average population of the State does not exceed sixteen to\r\nthe square mile, yet Andersonville was peopled at the rate of one\r\nmillion four hundred thousand to the square mile. With millions of\r\nacres of unsettled, useless, worthless pine barrens all around them,\r\nthe prisoners were wedged together so closely that there was scarcely\r\nroom to lie down at night, and a few had space enough to have served as\r\na grave. This, too, in a country where the land was of so little worth\r\nthat much of it had never been entered from the Government.\r\n\r\nThen, as to shelter and fire: Each of the prisons was situated in the\r\nheart of a primeval forest, from which the first trees that had ever\r\nbeen cut were those used in building the pens. Within a gun-shot of\r\nthe perishing men was an abundance of lumber and wood to have built\r\nevery man in prison a warm, comfortable hut, and enough fuel to supply\r\nall his wants. Supposing even, that the Rebels did not have the labor\r\nat hand to convert these forests into building material and fuel, the\r\nprisoners themselves would have gladly undertaken the work, as a means\r\nof promoting their own comfort, and for occupation and exercise. No\r\ntools would have been too poor and clumsy for them to work with. When\r\nlogs were occasionally found or brought into prison, men tore them to\r\npieces almost with their naked fingers. Every prisoner will bear me out\r\nin the assertion that there was probably not a root as large as a bit\r\nof clothes-line in all the ground covered by the prisons, that eluded\r\nthe faithfully eager search of freezing men for fuel. What else than\r\ndeliberate design can account for this systematic withholding from the\r\nprisoners of that which was so essential to their existence, and which\r\nit was so easy to give them?\r\n\r\nThis much for the circumstantial evidence connecting the Rebel\r\nauthorities with the premeditated plan for destroying the prisoners.\r\nLet us examine the direct evidence:\r\n\r\nThe first feature is the assignment to the command of the prisons of\r\n“General” John H. Winder, the confidential friend of Mr. Jefferson\r\nDavis, and a man so unscrupulous, cruel and bloody-thirsty that at\r\nthe time of his appointment he was the most hated and feared man in\r\nthe Southern Confederacy. His odious administration of the odious\r\noffice of Provost Marshal General showed him to be fittest of tools\r\nfor their purpose. Their selection--considering the end in view, was\r\neminently wise. Baron Haynau was made eternally infamous by a fraction\r\nof the wanton cruelties which load the memory of Winder. But it can be\r\nsaid in extenuation of Haynau’s offenses that he was a brave, skilful\r\nand energetic soldier, who overthrew on the field the enemies he\r\nmaltreated. If Winder, at any time during the war, was nearer the front\r\nthan Richmond, history does not mention it. Haynau was the bastard son\r\nof a German Elector and of the daughter of a village, druggist. Winder\r\nwas the son of a sham aristocrat, whose cowardice and incompetence in\r\nthe war of 1812 gave Washington into the hands of the British ravagers.\r\n\r\nIt is sufficient indication of this man’s character that he could look\r\nunmoved upon the terrible suffering that prevailed in Andersonville in\r\nJune, July, and August; that he could see three thousand men die each\r\nmonth in the most horrible manner, without lifting a finger in any way\r\nto assist them; that he could call attention in a self-boastful way\r\nto the fact that “I am killing off more Yankees than twenty regiments\r\nin Lee’s Army,” and that he could respond to the suggestions of the\r\nhorror-struck visiting Inspector that the prisoners be given at least\r\nmore room, with the assertion that he intended to leave matters just\r\nas they were--the operations of death would soon thin out the crowd so\r\nthat the survivors would have sufficient room.\r\n\r\nIt was Winder who issued this order to the Commander of the Artillery:\r\n\r\nORDER No. 13.\r\n\r\n                                   HEADQUARTERS MILITARY PRISON,\r\n                                   ANDERSONVILLE, Ga., July 27, 1864.\r\n\r\nThe officers on duty and in charge of the Battery of Florida Artillery\r\nat the time will, upon receiving notice that the enemy has approached\r\nwithin seven miles of this post, open upon the Stockade with grapeshot,\r\nwithout reference to the situation beyond these lines of defense.\r\n\r\n                                   JOHN H. WINDER,\r\n                              Brigadier General Commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiabolical is the only word that will come at all near fitly\r\ncharacterizing such an infamous order. What must have been the nature\r\nof a man who would calmly order twenty-five guns to be opened with\r\ngrape and canister at two hundred yards range, upon a mass of thirty\r\nthousand prisoners, mostly sick and dying! All this, rather than\r\nsuffer them to be rescued by their friends. Can there be any terms of\r\nreprobation sufficiently strong to properly denounce so malignant a\r\nmonster? History has no parallel to him, save among the blood-reveling\r\nkings of Dahomey, or those sanguinary Asiatic chieftains who built\r\npyramids of human skulls, and paved roads with men’s bones. How a man\r\nbred an American came to display such a Timour-like thirst for human\r\nlife, such an Oriental contempt for the sufferings of others, is one of\r\nthe mysteries that perplexes me the more I study it.\r\n\r\nIf the Rebel leaders who appointed this man, to whom he reported\r\ndirect, without intervention of superior officers, and who were fully\r\ninformed of all his acts through other sources than himself, were not\r\nresponsible for him, who in Heaven’s name was? How can there be a\r\npossibility that they were not cognizant and approving of his acts?\r\n\r\nThe Rebels have attempted but one defense to the terrible charges\r\nagainst them, and that is, that our Government persistently refused\r\nto exchange, preferring to let its men rot in prison, to yielding up\r\nthe Rebels it held. This is so utterly false as to be absurd. Our\r\nGovernment made overture after overture for exchange to the Rebels,\r\nand offered to yield many of the points of difference. But it could\r\nnot, with the least consideration for its own honor, yield up the\r\nnegro soldiers and their officers to the unrestrained brutality of the\r\nRebel authorities, nor could it, consistent with military prudence,\r\nparole the one hundred thousand well-fed, well-clothed, able-bodied\r\nRebels held by it as prisoners, and let them appear inside of a week in\r\nfront of Grant or Sherman. Until it would agree to do this the Rebels\r\nwould not agree to exchange, and the only motive--save revenge--which\r\ncould have inspired the Rebel maltreatment of the prisoners, was the\r\nexpectation of raising such a clamor in the North as would force the\r\nGovernment to consent to a disadvantageous exchange, and to give back\r\nto the Confederacy, at its most critical period one hundred thousand\r\nfresh, able-bodied soldiers. It was for this purpose, probably, that\r\nour Government and the Sanitary Commission were refused all permission\r\nto send us food and clothing. For my part, and I know I echo the\r\nfeelings of ninety-nine out of every hundred of my comrades, I would\r\nrather have staid in prison till I rotted, than that our Government\r\nshould have yielded to the degrading demands of insolent Rebels.\r\n\r\nThere is one document in the possession of the Government which seems\r\nto me to be unanswerable proof, both of the settled policy of the\r\nRichmond Government towards the Union prisoners, and of the relative\r\nmerits of Northern and Southern treatment of captives. The document is\r\na letter reading as follows:\r\n\r\n                              CITY POINT, Va., March 17, 1863.\r\n\r\nSIR:--A flag-of-truce boat has arrived with three hundred and fifty\r\npolitical prisoners, General Barrow and several other prominent men\r\namong them.\r\n\r\nI wish you to send me on four o’clock Wednesday morning, all the\r\nmilitary prisoners (except officers), and all the political prisoners\r\nyou have. If any of the political prisoners have on hand proof enough\r\nto convict them of being spies, or of having committed other offenses\r\nwhich should subject them to punishment, so state opposite their names.\r\nAlso, state whether you think, under all the circumstances, they should\r\nbe released. The arrangement I have made works largely in our favor. WE\r\nGET RID OF A SET OF MISERABLE WRETCHES, AND RECEIVE SOME OF THE BEST\r\nMATERIAL I EVER SAW.\r\n\r\nTell Captain Turner to put down on the list of political prisoners the\r\nnames of Edward P. Eggling, and Eugenia Hammermister. The President is\r\nanxious that they should get off. They are here now. This, of course,\r\nis between ourselves. If you have any political prisoners whom you can\r\nsend off safely to keep her company, I would like you to send her.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred and odd more political prisoners are on their way.\r\n\r\nI would be more full in my communication if I had time. Yours truly,\r\n\r\n                         ROBERT OULD, Commissioner of Exchange.\r\n\r\nTo Brigadier general John H. Winder.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, supposing that our Government, for good military reasons, or for\r\nno reason at all, declined to exchange prisoners, what possible excuse\r\nis that for slaughtering them by exquisite tortures? Every Government\r\nhas ap unquestioned right to decline exchanging when its military\r\npolicy suggests such a course; and such declination conveys no right\r\nwhatever to the enemy to slay those prisoners, either outright with the\r\nedge of the sword, or more slowly by inhuman treatment. The Rebels’\r\nattempts to justify their conduct, by the claim that our Government\r\nrefused to accede to their wishes in a certain respect, is too\r\npreposterous to be made or listened to by intelligent men.\r\n\r\nThe whole affair is simply inexcusable, and stands out a foul blot on\r\nthe memory of every Rebel in high place in the Confederate Government.\r\n\r\n“Vengeance is mine,” saith the Lord, and by Him must this great crime\r\nbe avenged, if it ever is avenged. It certainly transcends all human\r\npower. I have seen little indication of any Divine interposition\r\nto mete out, at least on this earth, adequate punishment to those\r\nwho were the principal agents in that iniquity. Howell Cobb died as\r\npeacefully in his bed as any Christian in the land, and with as few\r\napparent twinges of remorse as if he had spent his life in good deeds\r\nand prayer. The arch-fiend Winder died in equal tranquility, murmuring\r\nsome cheerful hope as to his soul’s future. Not one of the ghosts of\r\nhis hunger-slain hovered around to embitter his dying moments, as he\r\nhad theirs. Jefferson Davis “still lives, a prosperous gentleman,”\r\nthe idol of a large circle of adherents, the recipient of real estate\r\nfavors from elderly females of morbid sympathies, and a man whose mouth\r\nis full of plaints of his wrongs, and misappreciation. The rest of the\r\nleading conspirators have either departed this life in the odor of\r\nsanctity, surrounded by sorrowing friends, or are gliding serenely down\r\nthe mellow autumnal vale of a benign old age.\r\n\r\nOnly Wirz--small, insignificant, miserable Wirz, the underling, the\r\ntool, the servile, brainless, little fetcher-and-carrier of these men,\r\nwas punished--was hanged, and upon the narrow shoulders of this pitiful\r\nscapegoat was packed the entire sin of Jefferson Davis and his crew.\r\nWhat a farce!\r\n\r\nA petty little Captain made to expiate the crimes of Generals, Cabinet\r\nOfficers, and a President. How absurd!\r\n\r\nBut I do not ask for vengeance. I do not ask for retribution for one\r\nof those thousands of dead comrades, the glitter of whose sightless\r\neyes will follow me through life. I do not desire even justice on the\r\nstill living authors and accomplices in the deep damnation of their\r\ntaking off. I simply ask that the great sacrifices of my dead comrades\r\nshall not be suffered to pass unregarded to irrevocable oblivion;\r\nthat the example of their heroic self-abnegation shall not be lost,\r\nbut the lesson it teaches be preserved and inculcated into the minds\r\nof their fellow-countrymen, that future generations may profit by it,\r\nand others be as ready to die for right and honor and good government\r\nas they were. And it seems to me that if we are to appreciate their\r\nvirtues, we must loathe and hold up to opprobrium those evil men whose\r\nmalignity made all their sacrifices necessary. I cannot understand what\r\ngood self-sacrifice and heroic example are to serve in this world, if\r\nthey are to be followed by such a maudlin confusion of ideas as now\r\nthreatens to obliterate all distinction between the men who fought and\r\ndied for the Right and those who resisted them for the Wrong.",
