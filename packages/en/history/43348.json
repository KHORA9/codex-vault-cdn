CONSTABLE, Printers to His Majesty\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First publication of the Letters.] Public attention was first\r\ndrawn to the Paston Letters in the year 1787, when there issued from the\r\npress two quarto volumes with a very lengthy title, setting forth that\r\nthe contents were original letters written ‘by various persons of rank\r\nand consequence’ during the reigns of Henry VI., Edward IV., and Richard\r\nIII. The materials were derived from autographs in the possession of the\r\nEditor, a Mr. Fenn, of East Dereham, in Norfolk, who was well enough\r\nknown in society as a gentleman of literary and antiquarian tastes, but\r\nwho had not at that time attained any great degree of celebrity. Horace\r\nWalpole had described him, thirteen years before, as ‘a smatterer in\r\nantiquity, but a very good sort of man.’ What the great literary magnate\r\nafterwards thought of him we are not informed, but we know that he took\r\na lively interest in the Paston Letters the moment they were published.\r\nHe appears, indeed, to have given some assistance in the progress of the\r\nwork through the press. On its appearance he expressed himself with\r\ncharacteristic enthusiasm:--‘The letters of Henry VI.’s reign, etc., are\r\ncome out, and _to me_ make all other letters not worth reading. I have\r\ngone through one volume, and cannot bear to be writing when I am so\r\neager to be reading. . . . There are letters from _all_ my acquaintance,\r\nLord Rivers, Lord Hastings, the Earl of Warwick, whom I remember still\r\nbetter than Mrs. Strawbridge, though she died within these fifty years.\r\nWhat antiquary would be answering a letter from a living countess, when\r\nhe may read one from Eleanor Mowbray, Duchess of Norfolk?’[1-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1-1: _Walpole’s Letters_ (Cunningham’s ed.), ix. 92.]\r\n\r\nSo wrote the great literary exquisite and virtuoso, the man whose\r\nopinion in those days was life or death to a young author or a new\r\npublication. And in spite of all that was artificial and affected in his\r\ncharacter,--in spite even of the affectation of pretending a snobbish\r\ninterest in ancient duchesses--Walpole was one of the fittest men of\r\nthat day to appreciate such a publication. [Sidenote: What was thought\r\nof them by some.] Miss Hannah More was less easily pleased, and she no\r\ndoubt was the type of many other readers. The letters, she declared,\r\nwere quite barbarous in style, with none of the elegance of their\r\nsupposed contemporary Rowley. They might perhaps be of some use to\r\ncorrect history, but as letters and fine reading, nothing was to be said\r\nfor them.[2-1] It was natural enough that an age which took this view of\r\nthe matter should have preferred the forgeries of Chatterton to the most\r\ngenuine productions of the fifteenth century. The style of the Paston\r\nLetters, even if it had been the most polished imaginable, of course\r\ncould not have exhibited the polish of the eighteenth century, unless a\r\nChatterton had had some hand in their composition.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2-1: Roberts’s _Memoirs of Hannah More_, ii. 50.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General interest in the work.] Yet the interest excited by\r\nthe work was such that the editor had no reason to complain of its\r\nreception. The Paston Letters were soon in everybody’s hands. The work,\r\nindeed, appeared under royal patronage, for Fenn had got leave\r\nbeforehand to dedicate it to the King as ‘the avowed patron’ of\r\nantiquarian knowledge. This alone had doubtless some influence upon the\r\nsale; but the novel character of the publication itself must have\r\nexcited curiosity still more. A whole edition was disposed of in a week,\r\nand a second edition called for, which, after undergoing some little\r\nrevision, with the assistance of Mr. George Steevens, the Shakspearian\r\neditor, was published the same year. Meanwhile, to gratify the curious,\r\nthe original MS. letters were deposited for a time in the Library of the\r\nSociety of Antiquaries; but the King having expressed a wish to see\r\nthem, Fenn sent them to Buckingham Palace, then called the Queen’s\r\nPalace, requesting that, if they were thought worthy of a place in the\r\nRoyal Collection, His Majesty would be pleased to accept them. They were\r\naccordingly, it would seem, added to the Royal Library; and as an\r\nacknowledgment of the value of the gift, Fenn was summoned to Court, and\r\nreceived the honour of knighthood.\r\n\r\nBut the two volumes hitherto published by Fenn contained only a small\r\nselection out of a pretty considerable number of original letters of the\r\nsame period in his possession. The reception these two volumes had met\r\nwith now encouraged him to make a further selection, and he announced\r\nwith his second edition that another series of the Letters was in\r\npreparation, which was to cover the same period as the first two\r\nvolumes, and to include also the reign of Henry VII. Accordingly a third\r\nand fourth volume of the work were issued together in the year 1789,\r\ncontaining the new letters down to the middle of Edward IV.’s reign. A\r\nfifth and concluding volume, bringing the work down to the end of Henry\r\nVII.’s reign, was left ready for publication at Sir John Fenn’s death in\r\n1794, and was published by his nephew, Mr. Serjeant Frere, in 1823.\r\n\r\nOf the original MSS. of these letters and their descent Fenn gives but a\r\nbrief account in the preface to his first volume, which we will\r\nendeavour to supplement with additional facts to the best of our\r\nability. [Sidenote: The MSS.] The letters, it will be seen, were for the\r\nmost part written by or to particular members of the family of Paston in\r\nNorfolk. Here and there, it is true, are to be found among them State\r\npapers and other letters of great interest, which must have come to the\r\nhands of the family through some indirect channel; but the great\r\nmajority are letters distinctly addressed to persons of the name of\r\nPaston, and in the possession of the Pastons they remained for several\r\ngenerations. In the days of Charles II. the head of the family, Sir\r\nRobert Paston, was created Earl of Yarmouth; but his son William, the\r\nsecond bearer of the title, having got into debt and encumbered his\r\ninheritance, finally died without male issue, so that his title became\r\nextinct. While living in reduced circumstances, he appears to have\r\nparted with a portion of his family papers, which were purchased by the\r\ngreat antiquary and collector, Peter Le Neve, Norroy King of Arms. Le\r\nNeve was a Norfolk man, possessed of considerable estates at Witchingham\r\nand elsewhere in the county; and he made it a special object to collect\r\nMSS. and records relating to Norfolk and Suffolk. Just before his death\r\nin 1729 he made a will,[4-1] by which he bequeathed his MSS. to the\r\nerudite Dr. Tanner, afterwards Bishop of St. Asaph’s, and Thomas Martin\r\nof Palgrave; but this bequest was subject to the condition that within a\r\nyear after his death they should ‘procure a good and safe repository in\r\nthe Cathedral Church of Norwich, or in some other good and public\r\nbuilding in the said city’ for their preservation, the object being to\r\nmake them at all times accessible to those who wished to consult them.\r\nThe condition, however, was not fulfilled, and the bequest would\r\nnaturally have become null; but ‘honest Tom Martin of Palgrave’ (to give\r\nhim the familiar name by which he himself desired to be known) married\r\nthe widow of his friend, and thus became possessed of his MSS. by\r\nanother title.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4-1: _See_ Appendix after Introduction, No. I.]\r\n\r\nThe Le Neve collection, however, contained only a portion of the Paston\r\nfamily papers. On the death, in 1732, of the Earl of Yarmouth, who\r\noutlived Le Neve by three years, some thirty or forty chests of valuable\r\nletters and documents still remained at the family seat at Oxnead. These\r\ntreasures the Rev. Francis Blomefield was allowed to examine three years\r\nlater with a view to his county history, for which purpose he boarded at\r\nOxnead for a fortnight.[4-2] Of the results of a general survey of the\r\npapers he writes, on the 13th May 1735, to Major Weldon a number of\r\ninteresting particulars, of which the following may be quoted as bearing\r\nupon the subject before us:--‘There is another box full of the pardons,\r\ngrants, and old deeds, freedoms, etc., belonging to the Paston family\r\nonly, which I laid by themselves, for fear you should think them proper\r\nto be preserved with the family; they don’t relate to any estates. . . .\r\nThere are innumerable letters of good consequence in history still lying\r\namong the loose papers, all which I laid up in a corner of the room on a\r\nheap which contains several sacks full.’[5-1] But Blomefield afterwards\r\nbecame the owner of a considerable portion of these papers; for he not\r\nonly wrote his initials on several of them, and marked a good many\r\nothers with a mark by which he was in the habit of distinguishing\r\noriginal documents that he had examined and noted, but he also made a\r\npresent to a friend of one letter which must certainly have once been in\r\nthe Paston family archives. He himself refers to his ownership of\r\ncertain collections of documents in the Preface to his _History of\r\nNorfolk_, where he informs the reader that he has made distinct\r\nreference to the several authors and originals he had made use of in all\r\ncases, ‘except’ (these are his words) ‘where the originals are either in\r\nMr. Le Neve’s or my own collections, which at present I design to join\r\nto his, so that, being together, they may be consulted at all times.’\r\nApparently honest Tom Martin was still intending to carry out Le Neve’s\r\ndesign, and Blomefield purposed to aid it further by adding his own\r\ncollections to the Le Neve MSS. But though Martin lived for nearly forty\r\nyears after his marriage with Le Neve’s widow, and always kept this\r\ndesign in view, he failed to carry it out. His necessities compelled him\r\nto part with some of his treasures, but these apparently were mainly\r\nbooks enriched with MS. notes, not original ancient MSS., and even as he\r\ngrew old he did not altogether drop the project. He frequently formed\r\nresolutions that he would, _next year_, arrange what remained, and make\r\na selection for public use. But at last, at the age of seventy-four, he\r\nsuddenly died in his chair without having given effect to his purpose.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4-2: _Cursory Notices of the Reverend Francis\r\n    Blomefield._ By J. Wilton Rix, Esq.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5-1: _Norfolk Archæology_, ii. 210, 211.]\r\n\r\nNeither did his friend Blomefield, who died nine years before him, in\r\nJanuary 1762, succeed in giving effect to _his_ good intention of\r\nuniting his collections with the Le Neve MSS. For he died deeply in\r\ndebt, and by his will, made just before death, he directed all his\r\npersonal property to be sold in payment of his liabilities. His\r\nexecutors, however, declined to act, and administration was granted to\r\ntwo principal creditors. Of the Paston MSS. which were owned by him,\r\na few are now to be found in one of the volumes of the Douce Collection\r\nin the Bodleian Library at Oxford. These, it would seem, were first\r\npurchased by the noted antiquary John Ives,[6-1] who acquired a number\r\nof Le Neve’s, Martin’s, and Blomefield’s MSS.; and after his library was\r\nsold by auction in March 1777, they became part of the collections\r\nrelating to the counties of Oxford and Cambridge, which Gough, in his\r\n_British Topography_ (vol. ii. p. 5), informs us that he purchased at\r\nthe sale of Mr. Ives’ papers. To this same collection, probably,\r\nbelonged also a few of the scattered documents relating to the Paston\r\nfamily which have been met with among the miscellaneous stores of the\r\nBodleian Library, for a knowledge of which I was indebted to the late\r\nMr. W. H. Turner of Oxford.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6-1: _See_ Nichols’s _Literary Anecdotes_, iii. 199.]\r\n\r\nMartin’s executors seem to have done what they could to preserve the\r\nintegrity of his collections. A catalogue of his library was printed\r\nat Lynn in 1771, in the hope that some purchaser would be found to take\r\nthe whole. Such a purchaser did present himself, but not in the interest\r\nof the public. [Sidenote: By Mr. Worth.] A certain Mr. John Worth,\r\na chemist at Diss, bought both the library and the other collections,\r\nas a speculation, for £630. The printed books he immediately sold to\r\na firm at Norwich, who disposed of them by auction; the pictures and\r\nsmaller curiosities he sold by auction at Diss, and certain portions\r\nof the MSS. were sent, at different times, to the London market. But\r\nbefore he had completed the sale of all the collections, Mr. Worth died\r\nsuddenly in December 1774. That portion of the MSS. which contained the\r\nPaston Letters he had up to that time reserved. Mr. Fenn immediately\r\npurchased them of his executors, and they had been twelve years in his\r\npossession when he published his first two volumes of selections from\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSo much for the early history of the MSS. Their subsequent fate is not a\r\nlittle curious. On the 23rd May 1787, Fenn received his knighthood at\r\nSt. James’s, having then and there presented to the King three bound\r\nvolumes of MSS. which were the originals of his first two printed\r\nvolumes.[6-2] Yet, strange to say, these MSS. were afterwards lost sight\r\nof so completely that for a whole century nobody could tell what had\r\nbecome of them. They were not in the Royal Library afterwards given up\r\nto the British Museum; they were not to be found in any of the Royal\r\nPalaces. The late Prince Consort, just before his death, caused a\r\ncareful search to be made for them, but it proved quite ineffectual.\r\nTheir hiding-place remained unknown even when I first republished these\r\nLetters in the years 1872-75.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6-2: The following announcement appears in the _Morning\r\n    Chronicle_ of the 24th May 1787: ‘Yesterday, John Fenn, Esq.,\r\n    attended the levee at St. James’s, and had the honour of\r\n    presenting to His Majesty (bound in three volumes) the original\r\n    letters of which he had before presented a printed copy; when His\r\n    Majesty, as a mark of his gracious acceptance, was pleased to\r\n    confer on him the honour of knighthood.’]\r\n\r\nTo this mystery succeeded another of the same kind. The originals of the\r\nother three volumes were not presented to the king; but they, too,\r\ndisappeared, and remained for a long time equally undiscoverable. Even\r\nMr. Serjeant Frere, who edited the fifth volume from transcripts left by\r\nSir John Fenn after his death, declared that he had not been able to\r\nfind the originals of that volume any more than those of the others.\r\nStrange to say, however, the originals of that volume were in his house\r\nall the time, and were discovered by his son, Mr. Philip Frere, in the\r\nyear 1865, just after an ingenious _littérateur_ had made the complete\r\ndisappearance of _all_ the MSS. a ground for casting doubt on the\r\nauthenticity of the published letters. It is certainly a misfortune for\r\nhistorical literature, or at all events was in those days, that the\r\nowners of ancient MSS. commonly took so little pains to ascertain what\r\nit was that they had got. Since then the proceedings of the Historical\r\nMSS. Commission, which have brought to light vast stores of unsuspected\r\nmaterials for history, have awakened much more interest in such matters.\r\n\r\nThus three distinct portions of MSS. that had been carefully edited had\r\nall been lost sight of and remained undiscoverable for a long series of\r\nyears. The originals of the first two volumes presented to the King\r\ncould not be found. The originals of volumes iii. and iv. could not be\r\nfound. The originals of volume v. could not be found. These last,\r\nhowever, after a time, came to light, as we have seen, in 1865, having\r\nbeen discovered in the house of the late Mr. Philip Frere at Dungate, in\r\nCambridgeshire; and with them were found a large number of additional\r\nMSS., also belonging to the Paston Collection, among which was the\r\noriginal of one of the letters of volume iii. separated from all its\r\nfellows, whose place of concealment remained still unknown.\r\n\r\nThis discovery, however, was important, and at once suggested to me the\r\npossibility of producing a new edition of the Letters arranged in true\r\nchronological order, and augmented by those hitherto unedited. It\r\nsuggested, moreover, that more of the originals might even yet be\r\ndiscovered with a little further search, perhaps even in the same house.\r\nBut a further search at Dungate, though it brought to light a vast\r\nquantity of papers of different ages, many of them very curious, did not\r\nlead to the discovery of any other than the single document above\r\nreferred to belonging to any of the first four volumes. All that Mr.\r\nPhilip Frere could find belonging to the Paston Collection he sold to\r\nthe British Museum, and the rest he disposed of by auction.\r\n\r\nThe question then occurred: Since the originals of volumes iii. and iv.\r\nhad not been found at Dungate, might they be in the possession of the\r\nhead of the Frere family, the late Mr. George Frere of Roydon Hall, near\r\nDiss, in Norfolk? This was suggested to me as probable by Mr. Philip\r\nFrere, his cousin, and I wrote to him accordingly on the 3rd December\r\n1867. I received an answer from him dated on the 6th, that he did not\r\nsee how such MSS. should have found their way to Roydon, but if they\r\nturned up at any time he would let me know. Unluckily he seems to have\r\ndismissed the subject from his mind, and I received no answer to further\r\ninquiries repeated at various intervals. At last it appeared hopeless to\r\nwait longer and defer my edition of the Letters indefinitely on the\r\nchance of finding more originals anywhere. So the first volume of my\r\nedition went to press, and the second, and the third. But just after I\r\nhad printed off two Appendices to vol. iii., a friend of Mr. George\r\nFrere’s called upon me at the Record Office, and informed me that a\r\nnumber of original Paston letters had been discovered at Roydon, which\r\nhe had conveyed up to London. After some further communication with Mr.\r\nFrere himself I was allowed to inspect them at his son’s chambers in the\r\nTemple, when I found among them those very originals of Fenn’s third and\r\nfourth volumes which eight years before he could not believe were in his\r\npossession! Every one of them, I think, was there with just two\r\nexceptions--the first a document which, as already mentioned, was found\r\nat Dungate; the second a letter (No. 52 in this edition) now preserved\r\nat Holland House, the existence of which was made known to me before my\r\nsecond volume was issued by a recent book of the Princess Marie\r\nLiechtenstein.[9-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 9-1: _Holland House._ By Princess Marie Liechtenstein,\r\n    vol. ii. p. 198.]\r\n\r\nIt was mortifying, I confess, not to have received earlier intelligence\r\nof a fact that I had suspected all along. But it was better to have\r\nlearned it at the last moment than not till after my last volume was\r\npublished. So, having made two Appendices already to that volume, the\r\nonly thing to do was to add a third, in which the reader would find a\r\nbrief note of the discovery, with copies of some of the unpublished\r\nletters, and as full an account of the others belonging to the same\r\nperiod as circumstances would permit. Altogether there were no less than\r\nninety-five new original letters belonging to the period found at Roydon\r\nHall, along with the originals of Fenn’s third and fourth volumes.\r\n\r\nIn July 1888 these Roydon Hall MSS. were offered for sale at Christie’s.\r\nThey consisted then of 311 letters, mainly the originals of Fenn’s third\r\nand fourth volumes, and of those described in my third Appendix. Of the\r\nformer set there were only four letters wanting, viz. the two in volume\r\niii. whose existence is accounted for elsewhere, and two in volume iv.\r\n‘which,’ the sale catalogue observes, ‘are noted by Fenn himself as\r\nbeing no longer in his possession.’ As to the letters in my Appendix the\r\ncatalogue goes on to say:--\r\n\r\n  ‘Of the ninety-five additional letters above mentioned (Gairdner,\r\n  992-1086) _four_ are missing (Nos. 1016, 1029, 1077, 1085). On the\r\n  other hand, on collating the present collection with the printed\r\n  volumes, it was found to contain _four others_ of which no record\r\n  exists either in Fenn’s or Mr. Gairdner’s edition, and which\r\n  consequently appear to have escaped the notice of the latter\r\n  gentleman while examining the treasures at Roydon Hall.’\r\n\r\n‘The latter gentleman’ begs leave to say here that he never was at\r\nRoydon Hall in his life, and was only allowed to examine such of the\r\n‘treasures’ found there as were placed before him in the year 1875 in a\r\ncertain chamber in the Temple. A well-known bookseller purchased the\r\nMSS. offered at Christie’s for 500 guineas, and some years later (in\r\n1896), sold them to the British Museum. They are thus, at length,\r\navailable for general consultation. The number of missing originals,\r\nhowever, is not quite as given in Christie’s sale catalogue. There are\r\nfour, not two, lacking of volume iv. On the other hand, only two letters\r\nof the Appendix are wanting.[10-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 10-1: The missing letters of volume iv. are Nos. 24, 97,\r\n    99, and 105 (Nos. 551, 726, 735, and 758 of this edition). The\r\n    last never formed part of Fenn’s collection. I do not know of any\r\n    other noted by him as ‘no longer in his possession.’ The letters\r\n    missing of the Appendix are only Nos. 997 and 1019. Of the four\r\n    said to be missing in Christie’s catalogue, 1016 is not a document\r\n    at all, the number having been accidentally skipped in the\r\n    Inventory, and the other three are in the British Museum. No.\r\n    1077, however, is inaccurately described in the Appendix.]\r\n\r\nAbout fifteen years after the discovery at Roydon there came another\r\ndiscovery elsewhere. On the 29th March 1890 it was announced in the\r\n_Athenæum_ that the missing originals of Fenn’s first and second\r\nvolumes--that is to say, the MSS. presented to King George III.--had\r\nlikewise come to light again. They were found at Orwell Park, in\r\nSuffolk, in 1889, after the death of the late Colonel Tomline, and they\r\nremain there in the possession of his cousin, Mr. E. G. Pretyman, M.P.,\r\nnow Secretary to the Admiralty, who kindly showed them to me at his\r\nhouse soon after their discovery. They have come to him among family\r\npapers and heirlooms of which, being only tenant for life, he is not\r\nfree to dispose until some doubts can be removed as to their past\r\nhistory; and I accordingly forbear from saying more on this point except\r\nthat their place of deposit indicates that they may either have got\r\nmixed with the private papers and books of Pitt, of which a large number\r\nare in the Orwell library, or with those of his old tutor and secretary,\r\nDr. George Pretyman, better known as Bishop Tomline. Dr. Pretyman had\r\njust been appointed Bishop of Lincoln when Fenn published his first two\r\nvolumes, and it was many years afterwards that he assumed the name of\r\nTomline. But whether these MSS. came to his hands or to Pitt’s, or under\r\nwhat circumstances they were delivered to either, there is no evidence\r\nto show. Possibly the King’s illness in 1788 prevented their being\r\nplaced, or, it may be, replaced, in the Royal Library, where they were\r\nintended to remain.\r\n\r\nThe edition of these Letters published by Mr. Arber in 1872-75 was in\r\nthree volumes. It was printed from stereotype plates, and has been\r\nreissued more than once by the Messrs. Constable with corrections, and\r\nlatterly with an additional volume containing the Preface and\r\nIntroduction by themselves, and a Supplement giving the full text of\r\nthose newly-found letters of which the reader had to be content with a\r\nbare catalogue in 1875. My original aim to have a complete collection of\r\nall extant Paston Letters had been defeated; and there seemed nothing\r\nfor it but to let them remain even at the last in a general series, an\r\nAppendix and a Supplement. The present publishers, however, by\r\narrangement with Messrs. Constable, were anxious to meet the wants of\r\nscholars who desired to possess the letters, now that the collection\r\nseems to be as complete as it is ever likely to be, in a single series,\r\nand in a more luxurious form than that in which they have hitherto\r\nappeared. I have accordingly rearranged the letters as desired--a task\r\nnot altogether without its difficulties when nice chronological\r\nquestions had to be weighed and the story of the Pastons in all its\r\ndetails had for so many years ceased to occupy a foremost place in my\r\nthoughts; and I trust that the unity of the series will now give\r\nsatisfaction. At the same time, the opportunity has not been lost of\r\nrectifying such errors as have been brought to my notice, which could\r\nnot have been conveniently corrected in the stereotype editions.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the recovery of the originals of the letters printed by\r\nFenn, it has not been thought necessary to edit these anew from the MSS.\r\nWhether such a thing would be altogether practicable even now may\r\nperhaps be a question; at all events it would have delayed the work\r\nunduly. Fenn’s editing is, as I have shown in previous editions, fairly\r\nsatisfactory on the whole, and it is not to be supposed that a\r\ncomparison of all the printed letters with the original MSS. would lead\r\nto results of very material consequence. A large number have been\r\ncompared already, and the comparison inspires the greatest confidence in\r\nhis care and accuracy. His misreadings are really very few, his method\r\nof procedure having been such as to prevent their being either many or\r\nserious; while as to his suppressions I have found no reason to believe,\r\nfrom what examination I have been able to make, that any of them were of\r\nvery material importance.\r\n\r\nIt was not editorial carelessness on Fenn’s part which made a new\r\nedition desirable in 1872. It was, first of all, the advance of\r\nhistorical criticism since his day--or rather, perhaps, I should say, of\r\nthe means of verifying many things by the publication of historical\r\nsources and the greater accessibility of historical records. And\r\nsecondly, the discovery of such a large number of unprinted documents\r\nbelonging to the Paston Collection made it possible to study that\r\ncollection as a whole, and fill up the outlines of information which\r\nthey contained on matters both public and private. On this subject I may\r\nbe allowed simply to quote what I said in 1872 in the preface to the\r\nfirst volume:--\r\n\r\n  ‘The errors in Fenn’s chronology are numerous, and so exceedingly\r\n  misleading that, indispensable as these Letters now are to the\r\n  historian, there is not a single historian who has made use of them\r\n  but has misdated some event or other, owing to their inaccurate\r\n  arrangement. Even writers who have been most on their guard in some\r\n  places have suffered themselves to be misled in others. This is no\r\n  reproach to the former Editor, whose work is indeed a perfect model\r\n  of care and accuracy for the days in which he lived; but historical\r\n  criticism has advanced since that time, and facilities abound which\r\n  did not then exist for comparing one set of documents with another,\r\n  and testing the accuracy of dates by public records. The completion\r\n  of Blomefield’s _History of Norfolk_, and the admirable index added\r\n  to that work of late years by Mr. Chadwick, have also been of\r\n  eminent service in verifying minute facts. Moreover, the\r\n  comprehensive study of the whole correspondence, with the advantage\r\n  of having a part already published to refer to, has enabled me in\r\n  many cases to see the exact bearing of particular letters, which\r\n  before seemed to have no certain place in the chronology, not only\r\n  upon public events, but upon the Private affairs of the Paston\r\n  family. . . .\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Accuracy of Fenn’s text.] ‘The care taken by Sir John\r\n  Fenn to secure the accuracy of his text can be proved by many tests.\r\n  It might, indeed, be inferred from the elaborate plan of editing\r\n  that he adopted, exhibiting in every case two transcripts of the\r\n  same letter, the one to show the precise spelling and punctuation of\r\n  the original, the other to facilitate the perusal by modern\r\n  orthography. A work on which so much pains were bestowed, and which\r\n  was illustrated besides by numerous facsimiles of the original\r\n  handwritings, signatures, paper-marks, and seals of the letters, was\r\n  not likely to have been executed in a slovenly manner, in so far as\r\n  the text is concerned. But we are not left in this case to mere\r\n  presumptive evidence. The originals of the fifth volume have been\r\n  minutely examined by a committee of the Society of Antiquaries, and\r\n  compared all through with the printed text, and the general result\r\n  of this examination was that the errors are very few, and for the\r\n  most part trivial. Now, if this was the case with regard to that\r\n  volume, which it must be remembered was published after Fenn’s death\r\n  from transcripts prepared for the press, and had not the benefit of\r\n  a final revision of the proof-sheets by the editor, we have surely\r\n  every reason to suppose that the preceding volumes were at least not\r\n  less accurate.\r\n\r\n  ‘At all events, any inaccuracies that may exist in them were\r\n  certainly not the result of negligence. I have been favoured by Mr.\r\n  Almack, of Melford, near Sudbury, in Suffolk, with the loan of\r\n  several sheets of MS. notes bequeathed to him by the late Mr.\r\n  Dalton, of Bury St. Edmunds, who transcribed a number of the\r\n  original MSS. for Sir John Fenn. These papers contain a host of\r\n  minute queries and criticisms, which were the result of a close\r\n  examination of the first four volumes, undertaken at Fenn’s request.\r\n  Those on the first two volumes are dated on the 3rd and 7th of May\r\n  1788, more than a year after the book was published. But on vols.\r\n  iii. and iv. there are two separate sets of observations, the first\r\n  of which were made on the transcripts before they were sent to\r\n  press, the other, like those on the two first volumes, on the\r\n  published letters. From an examination of these criticisms, and also\r\n  from the results of the examination of the fifth volume by the\r\n  committee of the Society of Antiquaries,[13-1] I have been led to\r\n  the opinion that the manner in which Sir John Fenn prepared his\r\n  materials for the press was as follows:-- [Sidenote: Mode in which\r\n  Fenn prepared the letters for publication.] Two copies were first\r\n  made of every letter, the one in the exact spelling and punctuation\r\n  of the original, the other in modern orthography. Both these copies\r\n  were taken direct from the original, and possibly in the case of the\r\n  first two volumes they were both made by Fenn himself. In vols. iii.\r\n  and iv., however, it is stated that many of the transcripts were\r\n  made by Mr. Dalton, while those of vol. v. were found to be almost\r\n  all in his handwriting when that volume was sent to press in\r\n  1823.[13-2] But this statement probably refers only to the copies in\r\n  the antique spelling. Those in modern spelling I believe to have\r\n  been made for the most part, if not altogether, by Fenn himself.\r\n  When completed, the two copies were placed side by side, and given\r\n  to Mr. Dalton to take home with him. Mr. Dalton then made a close\r\n  comparison of the two versions, and pointed out every instance in\r\n  which he found the slightest disagreement between them, or where he\r\n  thought an explanation might be usefully bracketed into the modern\r\n  version. These comments in the case of vol. iii. are upwards of 400\r\n  in number, and extend over eighteen closely written pages quarto. It\r\n  is clear that they one and all received the fullest consideration\r\n  from Sir John Fenn before the work was published. Every one of the\r\n  discrepancies pointed out between the two versions is rectified in\r\n  the printed volume, and there cannot be a doubt that in every such\r\n  case the original MS. was again referred to, to settle the disputed\r\n  reading.\r\n\r\n  ‘One or two illustrations of this may not be unacceptable to the\r\n  reader. The following are among the observations made by Mr. Dalton\r\n  on the transcripts of vol. iii. as prepared for press. [Sidenote:\r\n  Examples.] In Letter viii. was a passage in which occurred the\r\n  words, “that had of your father certain lands _one_ seven years or\r\n  eight years agone.” Mr. Dalton’s experience as a transcriber appears\r\n  to have suggested to him that “one” was a very common misreading of\r\n  the word “over” in ancient MSS., and he accordingly suggested that\r\n  word as making better sense. His surmise turned out to be the true\r\n  reading, and the passage stands corrected accordingly in the printed\r\n  volume. In Letter xxiv. there was a discrepancy in the date between\r\n  the transcript in ancient spelling and the modern version. In the\r\n  latter it was “the 4th day of December,” whereas the former gave it\r\n  as the 3rd. On examination it appears that the _modern_ version was\r\n  found to be correct, a Roman “iiij.” having been misread in the\r\n  other as “iij.” Thus we have very sufficient evidence that the\r\n  modern copy could not have been taken from the ancient, but was made\r\n  independently from the original MS. Another instance of the same\r\n  thing occurs in the beginning of Letter xli., where the words “to my\r\n  power” had been omitted in the literal transcript, but were found in\r\n  the modern copy.\r\n\r\n  ‘Mr. Dalton’s part in the work of transcription appears clearly in\r\n  several of his observations. One of the transcripts is frequently\r\n  referred to as “my copy”; and an observation made on Letter lxxxvi.\r\n  shows pretty clearly that the copy so referred to was the literal\r\n  one. At the bottom of that letter is the following brief\r\n  postscript:--“Utinam iste mundus malignus transiret et\r\n  concupiscentia ejus”; on which Mr. Dalton remarks as follows:--“I\r\n  have added this on _your_ copy as supposing it an oversight, and\r\n  hope it is properly inserted.” Thus it appears that Mr. Dalton’s own\r\n  transcript had the words which were deficient in the other, and\r\n  that, being tolerably certain they existed in the original, he\r\n  transferred them to the copy made by Fenn. Now when it is considered\r\n  that these words are written in the original MS. with peculiarly\r\n  crabbed contractions, which had to be preserved in the literal\r\n  version as exactly as they could be represented in type,[15-1] it\r\n  will, I think, appear evident that Mr. Dalton could never have\r\n  ventured to supply them in such a form without the original before\r\n  him. It is clear, therefore, that his copy was the literal\r\n  transcript, and that of Fenn the modern version.\r\n\r\n  ‘Again, in Letter xxxi. of the same volume, on the second last line\r\n  of page 137, occur the words, “that he obey not the certiorari.” On\r\n  this passage occurs the following query--“The word for ‘obey’ seems\r\n  unintelligible. Have I not erred from the original in my copy?”\r\n  Another case will show how by this examination the errors of the\r\n  original transcripts were eliminated. In Letter xxxiv., at the\r\n  bottom of pp. 144-5, occurs the name of Will or William Staunton. It\r\n  appears this name was first transcribed as “Robert Fraunton” in the\r\n  right or modern version; on which Mr. Dalton remarks, “It is William\r\n  in orig.” (Mr. Dalton constantly speaks of the transcript in ancient\r\n  spelling as the “original” in these notes, though it is clear he had\r\n  not the real original before him at the time he made them).\r\n  Strangely enough, Mr. Dalton does not suspect the surname as well as\r\n  the Christian name, but it is clear that both were wrong, and that\r\n  they were set right in consequence of this query directing the\r\n  editor’s attention once more to the original MS.’\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 13-1: _Archæol._ vol. xli. p. 39.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 13-2: _See_ Advertisement in the beginning of the\r\n    volume, p. vii.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 15-1: The following is the exact form in which they\r\n    stand in the literal or left-hand version:--‘Utia’z iste mu’d\r\n    maligu{s} t’nsir{t} & c’up’ia e{s}.’]\r\n\r\n  [[‘The care taken by Sir John\r\n  _opening quotation mark missing_]]\r\n\r\nTo this I may add some further evidences of Fenn’s editorial care and\r\naccuracy. When the second volume of my first edition was published in\r\n1874, my attention was called, as already mentioned, to the existence at\r\nHolland House of the original of one of those letters[15-2] which I had\r\nreprinted from Fenn. It was one of the letters in Fenn’s third volume,\r\nand only one[15-3] other letter in that volume had then turned up.\r\nI carefully compared both these papers with the documents as printed,\r\nand in both, as I remarked in the Preface to vol. ii., the exact spelling\r\nwas given with the most scrupulous accuracy, so that there was scarcely\r\nthe most trivial variation between the originals and the printed text.\r\nBut a more careful estimate, alike of Fenn’s merits and of his defects\r\nas an editor, became possible when, on the publication of the third\r\nvolume of the same edition, I was able, as I have already shown, to\r\nannounce at the last moment the result of a cursory inspection of the\r\noriginals of his third and fourth volumes. And what I said at that time\r\nmay be here transcribed:--\r\n\r\n  ‘The recovery of these long-lost originals, although, unfortunately,\r\n  too late to be of the use it might have been in this edition, is\r\n  important in two ways: first, as affording an additional means of\r\n  testing Fenn’s accuracy as an editor; and secondly, as a means of\r\n  testing the soundness of some occasional inferences which the\r\n  present Editor was obliged to draw for himself in the absence of the\r\n  originals. More than one instance occurs in this work in which it\r\n  will be seen that I have ventured to eliminate from the text as\r\n  spurious a heading printed by Fenn as if it were a part of the\r\n  document which it precedes. Thus, in No. 19,[16-1] I pointed out\r\n  that the title, in which Judge Paston is called “Sir William Paston,\r\n  knight,” could not possibly be contemporaneous; and the document\r\n  itself shows that this opinion was well founded. It bears, indeed,\r\na   modern endorsement in a handwriting of the last century much to the\r\n  same effect as Sir John Fenn’s heading; but this, of course, is no\r\n  authority at all. In the same way I showed that the title printed by\r\n  Fenn, as a heading to No. 191,[16-2] was utterly erroneous, and\r\n  could not possibly have existed in the original MS. This conclusion\r\n  is also substantiated by the document, which, I may add, bears in\r\n  the margin the heading “Copia,” showing that it was a transcript.\r\n  The document itself being an important State Paper, there were\r\n  probably a number of copies made at the time; but as no others have\r\n  been preserved, it is only known to us as one of the Paston Letters.\r\n\r\n  ‘Another State Paper (No. 238),[16-3] of which a copy was likewise\r\n  sent to John Paston, has a heading which Sir John Fenn very\r\n  curiously misread. It is printed in this edition[16-4] as it stands\r\n  in the first, _Vadatur J. P._, meaning apparently “John Paston gives\r\n  security, or stands pledged.” But it turns out on examination that\r\n  the reading of the original is _Tradatur J. P._ (Let this be\r\n  delivered to John Paston).\r\n\r\n  ‘To return to No. 19, it will be seen that I was obliged to reprint\r\n  from Fenn in the preliminary note a few words which he had found\r\n  written on the back of the letter, of which it was difficult to make\r\n  any perfect sense, but which seemed to imply that the bill was\r\n  delivered to Parliament in the 13th year of Henry VI. I pointed out\r\n  that there seemed to be some error in this, as no Parliament\r\n  actually met in the 13th year of Henry VI. The original endorsement,\r\n  however, is perfectly intelligible and consistent with facts, when\r\n  once it has been accurately deciphered. The handwriting, indeed, is\r\n  very crabbed, and for a considerable time I was puzzled; but the\r\n  words are as follows:--“Falsa billa Will’i Dallyng ad parliamentum\r\n  tempore quo Henricus Grey fuit vicecomes, ante annum terciodecimum\r\n  Regis Henrici vj{ti}.” I find as a matter of fact that Henry Grey\r\n  was sheriff (_vicecomes_) of Norfolk, first in the 8th and 9th, and\r\n  again in the 12th and 13th year of Henry VI., and that Parliament\r\n  sat in November and December of the 12th year (1433); so that the\r\n  date of the document is one year earlier than that assigned to it.\r\n\r\n  ‘Again, I ventured to question on internal evidence the authorship\r\n  of a letter (No. 910)[17-1] which Fenn had assigned to William\r\n  Paston, the uncle of Sir John Paston. At the end is the signature\r\n  “Wyll’m Paston,” with a reference in Fenn to a facsimile engraved in\r\n  a previous volume. But the evidence seemed to me very strong that\r\n  the William Paston who wrote this letter was not Sir John’s uncle,\r\n  but his brother. The inspection of the original letter itself has\r\n  proved to me that I was right. The signatures of the two Williams\r\n  were not altogether unlike each other; but the signature appended to\r\n  this letter is unquestionably that of the younger man, not of his\r\n  uncle; while the facsimile, to which Fenn erroneously refers the\r\n  reader, is that of the uncle’s signature taken from a different\r\n  letter.\r\n\r\n  ‘It may perhaps be conceived that if even these few errors could be\r\n  detected in Fenn’s work by one who had not yet an opportunity of\r\n  consulting the original MSS., a large number of others would be\r\n  discovered by a minute comparison of the printed volumes with the\r\n  letters themselves. This suspicion, however, is scarcely borne out\r\n  by the facts. I cannot profess to have made anything like an\r\n  exhaustive examination, but so far as I have compared these MSS.\r\n  with the printed text, I find no evidence of more than very\r\n  occasional inaccuracy, and, generally speaking, in matters very\r\n  immaterial. On the contrary, an inspection of these last recovered\r\n  originals has greatly confirmed the opinion, which the originals\r\n  previously discovered enabled me to form, of the scrupulous fidelity\r\n  and care with which the letters were first edited. For the most\r\n  part, not only the words, but the exact spelling of the MSS. is\r\n  preserved, with merely the most trifling variations. Sir John,\r\n  indeed, was not a trained archivist, and there are what may be\r\n  called errors of system in his mode of reading, such as, for\r\n  instance, the omission of contractions that may be held to represent\r\n  a final _e_, or the rendering a final dash by _s_ instead of _es_.\r\n  In such things the plan that he pursued was obvious. But it is\r\n  manifest that in other respects he is very accurate indeed; for he\r\n  had made so careful a study of these MSS. that he was quite familiar\r\n  with most of the ancient modes of handwriting, and, on the whole,\r\n  very seldom mistook a reading.\r\n\r\n  ‘I may add, that this recent discovery enables me to vindicate his\r\n  accuracy in one place, even where it seemed before to be very\r\n  strangely at fault. At the end of Letter iii. of the fifth\r\n  volume,[18-1] occurs in the original edition the following\r\n  postscript:--“I warn you keep this letter close, and lose it not;\r\n  rather burn it.” On comparing this letter with the original, the\r\n  Committee of the Society of Antiquaries, some years ago, were amazed\r\n  to find that there was no such postscript in the MS., and they were\r\n  a good deal at a loss to account for its insertion. It now appears,\r\n  however, that this letter was preserved in duplicate, for among the\r\n  newly-recovered MSS. I discovered a second copy, being a corrected\r\n  draft, in Margaret Paston’s own hand, at the end of which occurs the\r\n  P.S. in question.\r\n\r\n  ‘It must be acknowledged, however, that Fenn’s mode of editing was\r\n  not in all respects quite so satisfactory. Defects, of which no one\r\n  could reasonably have complained in his own day, are now a serious\r\n  drawback, especially where the original MSS. are no longer\r\n  accessible. Occasionally, as we have seen, he inserts a heading of\r\n  his own in the text of a document without any intimation that it is\r\n  not in the original; but this is so rare a matter that little need\r\n  be said about it. A more serious fault is, that in vols. iii. and\r\n  iv. he has published occasionally mere extracts from a letter as if\r\n  it were the whole letter. In vols. i. and ii. he avowedly left out\r\n  passages of little interest, and marked the places where they\r\n  occurred with asterisks; but in the two succeeding volumes he has\r\n  not thought it necessary to be so particular, and he has made the\r\n  omissions _sub silentio_. For this indeed no one can seriously blame\r\n  him. The work itself, as he had planned it, was only a selection of\r\n  letters from a correspondence, and a liberal use of asterisks would\r\n  not have helped to make it more interesting to the public.\r\n  Occasionally he even inverts the order of his extracts, printing a\r\n  postscript, or part of a postscript, in the body of a letter, and\r\n  placing at the end some passage that occurs in the letter itself,\r\n  for no other reason apparently than that it might read better as a\r\n  whole.\r\n\r\n  ‘Thus Letter 37 of this edition[18-2] (vol. iii., Letter vi., in\r\n  Fenn) is only a brief extract, the original being a very long\r\n  letter, though the subjects touched upon are not of very great\r\n  interest. So also Letter 171 (Letter xxx. in Fenn’s third\r\n  volume)[18-3] is a set of extracts. Letter 182 (vol. iii., Letter\r\n  xxxix., in Fenn)[18-4] is the same; and the first part of what is\r\n  given as a postscript is not a postscript in the original, but\r\n  actually comes before the first printed paragraph.\r\n\r\n  ‘In short, it was the aim of Sir John Fenn to reproduce with\r\n  accuracy the spelling and the style of the MSS. he had before him;\r\n  but as for the substance, to give only so much as he thought would\r\n  be really interesting. The letters themselves he regarded rather as\r\n  specimens of epistolary art in the fifteenth century than as a\r\n  substantial contribution to our knowledge of the times. To have\r\n  given a complete transcript of every letter, or even a _résumé_ in\r\n  his own words of all that concerned lawsuits, leases, bailiffs’\r\n  accounts, and a number of other matters of equally little interest,\r\n  formed no part of his design; but the task that he had really set\r\n  himself he executed with admirable fidelity. He grudged no labour or\r\n  expense in tracing facsimiles of the signatures, the seals, and the\r\n  watermarks on the paper. All that could serve to illustrate the\r\n  manners of the period, either in the contents of the letters, or in\r\n  the handwritings, or the mode in which they were folded, he esteemed\r\n  most valuable; and for these things his edition will continue still\r\n  to be much prized. But as it was clearly impossible in that day to\r\n  think of printing the whole correspondence, and determining\r\n  precisely the chronology by an exhaustive study of minutiæ, there\r\n  seemed no good reason why he should not give two or three paragraphs\r\n  from a letter without feeling bound to specify that they were merely\r\n  extracts. Yet even these defects are not of frequent occurrence. The\r\n  omissions are by no means numerous, and the matter they contain is\r\n  generally unimportant in itself.’\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 15-2: No. 38 in that edition, No. 52 in this.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 15-3: It was Letter 1 in Fenn’s third volume, No. 18 in\r\n    my first edition, No. 24 in this.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 16-1: No. 25 in present edition.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 16-2: No. 230 in present edition.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 16-3: No. 282 in present edition.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 16-4: That is to say, in the edition published by Mr.\r\n    Arber in 1875, when it was impossible to correct the text.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 17-1: No. 1033 in present edition.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 18-1: No. 787 of this edition.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 18-2: No. 51 of present edition.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 18-3: No. 205.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 18-4: No. 221.]\r\n\r\nI took advantage, however, at that time, of the recovery of so many of\r\nthe missing originals to make a cursory examination for the further\r\ntesting of Fenn’s editorial accuracy. Two or three letters I compared\r\ncarefully with the originals throughout, and in others I made special\r\nreference to passages where doubts were naturally suggested, either from\r\nthe obscurity of the words or from any other cause as to the correctness\r\nof the reading. The results of this examination I gave in an Appendix at\r\nthe end of the Introduction to the third volume in 1875, and such errors\r\nas I was then able to detect are corrected in the present edition.\r\n\r\nApart from such corrections, the letters are here reproduced as they are\r\nprinted in previous editions, only in a better order. Fenn’s text has\r\nbeen followed, where no corrections have been found, in all the letters\r\nprinted by him except those of his fifth volume. The exact transcript\r\ngiven on the left-hand pages of Fenn’s edition has been strictly adhered\r\nto, except that contractions have been extended; and even in this\r\nprocess we have always been guided by the interpretation given by Fenn\r\nhimself in his modern version on the right-hand pages. All the other\r\nletters in this publication are edited from the original MSS., with a\r\nvery few exceptions in which these cannot be found. In some places,\r\nindeed, where the contents of a letter are of very little interest, it\r\nhas been thought sufficient merely to give an abstract instead of a\r\ntranscript, placing the abstract in what is believed to be its true\r\nplace in the series chronologically. Abstracts are also given of\r\ndocuments that are too lengthy and formal to be printed, and, in one\r\ncase, of a letter sold at a public sale, of which a transcript is not\r\nnow procurable. In the same manner, wherever I have found the slightest\r\nnote or reference, whether in Fenn’s footnotes or in Blomefield’s\r\n_Norfolk_--where a few such references may be met with--to any letter\r\nthat appears originally to have belonged to the Paston correspondence,\r\neven though the original be now inaccessible, and our information about\r\nthe contents the most scanty, the reader will find a notice of all that\r\nis known about the missing document in the present publication.\r\n\r\nI wish it were in my power to make the present edition better still. But\r\nthere have been always formidable obstacles to completeness during the\r\nthirty years and more since I first took up the business of editing the\r\nletters; and though many of these obstacles have been removed, my\r\nenergies are naturally not quite what they once were. The publishers,\r\nhowever, have thought it time for a more satisfactory edition, and I\r\nhope I have done my best. It remains to say a few words about the\r\noriginal MSS. and the places in which they now exist.\r\n\r\nOf those at Orwell Park I have already spoken. They are contained in\r\nthree half-bound volumes, and are the originals of the letters printed\r\nby Fenn in his first and second volumes.\r\n\r\nIn the British Museum are contained, first of all, four volumes of the\r\n‘Additional MSS.’ numbered 27,443 to 27,446, consisting of the originals\r\nof volume v. of Fenn’s edition which was published after his death, and\r\na number of other letters first printed by me in the edition of 1872-75.\r\nThe nine volumes which follow these, viz. ‘Additional MSS.,’\r\n27,447-27,455, contain also Paston letters but of a later date, and\r\npapers relating to Sir John Fenn’s publication. There is also a separate\r\nvolume of ‘Paston letters’ in ‘Additional MS.’ 33,597; but these, too,\r\nare mostly of later date, only eight being of the fifteenth century.\r\nFurther, there are the Roydon Hall MSS. (including with, I believe, only\r\ntwo exceptions the originals of Fenn’s third and fourth volumes), which\r\nare contained in the volumes ‘Additional,’ 34,888-9. And finally there\r\nare two Paston letters (included in this edition) in ‘Additional MS.’\r\n35,251. These are all that are in the British Museum. Besides these\r\nthere are, as above noticed, a few MSS. in a volume of the Douce\r\nCollection and the other stray MSS. in the Bodleian Library at Oxford\r\nabove referred to. At Oxford, also, though not strictly belonging to the\r\nPaston family correspondence, are a number of valuable papers, some of\r\nwhich are included in this edition, having an important bearing on the\r\nfortunes of the family. These are among the muniments contained in the\r\ntower of Magdalene College. As the execution of Sir John Fastolf’s will\r\nultimately devolved upon Bishop Waynflete, who, instead of a college at\r\nCaister, made provision for a foundation of seven priests and seven poor\r\nscholars in Magdalene College, a number of papers relative to the\r\ndisputes between the executors and the arrangement between the Bishop\r\nand John Paston’s sons have been preserved among the documents of that\r\ncollege. My attention was first called to these many years ago by Mr.\r\nMacray, through whom I obtained copies, in the first place, of some\r\nentries from an old index of the deeds relating to Norfolk and Suffolk,\r\nwhich had already been referred to by Chandler in his Life of Bishop\r\nWaynflete. Afterwards Mr. Macray, who had for some time been engaged in\r\na catalogue of the whole collection, was obliging enough to send me one\r\nor two abstracts of his own made from the original documents even before\r\nhe was able to refer me to his report on the muniments of Magdalene\r\nCollege, printed in the Fourth Report of the Historical MSS. Commission.\r\nIt will be seen that I have transcribed several interesting entries from\r\nthis source.\r\n\r\nFurther, there are just a few Paston letters preserved in Pembroke\r\nCollege, Cambridge.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat remains to be said is only the confession of personal obligations,\r\nincurred mainly long ago in connection with this work. The lapse of\r\nyears since my first edition of these letters was issued, in 1872,\r\nnaturally reminds me of the loss of various friends who favoured and\r\nassisted it in various ways. Among these were the late Colonel Chester,\r\nMr. H. C. Coote, Mr. Richard Almack of Melford, Mr. W. H. Turner of\r\nOxford, Mr. J. H. Gurney, Mr. Fitch, and Mr. L’Estrange of Norwich. On\r\nthe other hand, I am happy to reckon still among the living Dr. Jessopp,\r\nMr. Aldis Wright, Miss Toulmin Smith, and Mr. J. C. C. Smith, now a\r\nretired official of the Probate Office at Somerset House, who all gave\r\nme kindly help so long ago. And I have further to declare my obligations\r\nto Mr. Walter Rye, a gentleman well known as the best living authority\r\non Norfolk topography and families, for most friendly and useful\r\nassistance in the way of notes and suggestions towards later editions.\r\nI have also quite recently received help (confessed elsewhere) from the\r\nRev. William Hudson of Eastbourne, and have further had my attention\r\ncalled to significant documents in the Public Record Office by some of\r\nmy old friends and colleagues there.\r\n\r\nBut among the departed, there is one whom I have reserved for mention by\r\nhimself, not so much for any particular assistance given me long ago in\r\nthe preparation of this work as for the previous education in historical\r\nstudy which I feel that I received from intercourse with him. I had been\r\nyears engaged in the public service, and always thought that the records\r\nof the realm ought to be better utilised than they were in those days\r\nfor the purpose of historical research; but how even Record clerks were\r\nto become well acquainted with them under the conditions then existing\r\nit was difficult to see. For each of us had his own little task assigned\r\nto him, and had really very little opportunity, if ever so willing, to\r\ngo beyond it. Nor was there too much encouragement given under official\r\nregulations to anything like historical training; for the Record Office,\r\nwhen first constituted, was supposed to exist for the sake of litigants\r\nwho wanted copies of documents, rather than for that of historical\r\nstudents who wanted to read them with other objects. Besides, people did\r\nnot generally imagine then that past history could be rewritten, except\r\nby able and graphic pens which, perhaps, could put new life into old\r\nfacts without a very large amount of additional research. The idea that\r\nthe country contained vast stores of long-neglected letters capable of\r\nyielding up copious new information to supplement and to correct the old\r\nstory of our national annals had hardly dawned upon anybody--least of\r\nall, perhaps, on humble officials bound to furnish office copies of\r\n‘fines’ and ‘recoveries’ and antiquated legal processes. Even the State\r\nPapers, at that time, were kept apart from the Public Records, and could\r\nonly be consulted by special permission from a Secretary of State. No\r\nclerk, either of the Record or State Paper Department, knew more than\r\nwas contained within his own particular province. But by the wise policy\r\nof the late Lord Romilly these red-tape bands were ultimately broken;\r\nand just at that time I had the rare privilege of being appointed to\r\nassist the late Reverend John S. Brewer in one of the great works which\r\nhis Lordship set on foot to enable the British public to understand the\r\nvalue of its own MSS. It was to this association with Mr. Brewer that I\r\nfeel I owe all my historical training, and I made some acknowledgment of\r\nthat debt in 1872 when I dedicated to him my first edition of this work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Paston Family_\r\n\r\nThe little village of Paston, in Norfolk, lies not far from the sea,\r\nwhere the land descends gently behind the elevated ground of Mundesley,\r\nand the line of the shore, proceeding eastward from Cromer, begins to\r\ntend a little more towards the south. It is about twenty miles north of\r\nNorwich. The country, though destitute of any marked features, is not\r\nuninteresting. Southwards, where it is low and flat, the ruins of\r\nBromholm Priory attract attention. But, on the whole, it is an\r\nout-of-the-way district, unapproachable by sea, for the coast is\r\ndangerous, and offering few attractions to those who visit it by land.\r\nIndeed, till quite recently, no railways had come near it, and the means\r\nof access were not superabundant. Here, however, lived for several\r\ncenturies a family which took its surname from the place, and whose\r\nprivate correspondence at one particular epoch sheds no inconsiderable\r\nlight on the annals of their country.\r\n\r\nOf the early history of this family our notices are scanty and\r\nuncertain. A Norman descent was claimed for them not only by the county\r\nhistorian Blomefield but by the laborious herald, Francis Sandford,\r\nauthor of a _Genealogical History of the Kings of England_, on the\r\nevidence of documents which have been since dispersed. Sandford’s\r\ngenealogy of the Paston family was drawn up in the year 1674, just after\r\nSir Robert Paston had been raised to the peerage by the title of\r\nViscount Yarmouth, before he was promoted to the higher dignity of earl.\r\nIt still remains in MS.; but a pretty full account of it will be found\r\nin the fourth volume of _Norfolk Archæology_. The story of the early\r\nancestors, however, does not concern us here. At the time the family and\r\ntheir doings become best known to us, their social position was merely\r\nthat of small gentry. One of these, however, was a justice of the Common\r\nPleas in the reign of Henry VI., whose uprightness of conduct caused him\r\nto be commonly spoken of by the name of the Good Judge. He had a son,\r\nJohn, brought up to the law, who became executor to the old soldier and\r\nstatesman, Sir John Fastolf. This John Paston had a considerable family,\r\nof whom the two eldest sons, strange to say, both bore the same\r\nChristian name as their father. They were also both of them soldiers,\r\nand each, in his time, attained the dignity of knighthood. But of them\r\nand their father, and their grandfather the judge, we shall have more to\r\nsay presently. After them came Sir William Paston, a lawyer, one of\r\nwhose daughters, Eleanor, married Thomas Manners, first Earl of Rutland.\r\nHe had also two sons, of whom the first, Erasmus, died before him.\r\n[Sidenote: Clement Paston.] The second, whose name was Clement, was\r\nperhaps the most illustrious of the whole line. Born at Paston Hall, in\r\nthe immediate neighbourhood of the sea, he had an early love for ships,\r\nwas admitted when young into the naval service of Henry VIII., and\r\nbecame a great commander. In an engagement with the French he captured\r\ntheir admiral, the Baron de St. Blankheare or Blankard, and kept him\r\nprisoner at Caister, near Yarmouth, till he had paid 7000 crowns for his\r\nransom, besides giving up a number of valuables contained in his ship.\r\nOf this event Clement Paston preserved till his death a curious memorial\r\namong his household utensils, and we read in his will that he bequeathed\r\nto his nephew his ‘standing bowl called the Baron St. Blankheare.’ He\r\nserved also by land as well as by sea, and was with the Protector\r\nSomerset in Scotland at the battle of Pinkie. In Mary’s reign he is said\r\nto have been the person to whom the rebel Sir Thomas Wyat surrendered.\r\nIn his later years he was more peacefully occupied in building a fine\r\nfamily seat at Oxnead. He lived till near the close of the reign of\r\nElizabeth, having earned golden opinions from each of the sovereigns\r\nunder whom he served. ‘Henry VIII.,’ we are told, ‘called him his\r\nchampion; the Duke of Somerset, Protector in King Edward’s reign, called\r\nhim his soldier; Queen Mary, her seaman; and Queen Elizabeth, her\r\nfather.’[27-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 27-1: Blomefield’s _History of Norfolk_, vi. 487, 488.]\r\n\r\nClement Paston died childless, and was succeeded by his nephew, another\r\nSir William, whose name is well known in Norfolk as the founder of North\r\nWalsham School, and whose effigy in armour is visible in North Walsham\r\nChurch, with a Latin epitaph recording acts of munificence on his part,\r\nnot only to the grammar-school, but also to the cathedrals of Bath and\r\nNorwich, to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and to the poor at\r\nYarmouth.\r\n\r\nFrom Sir William the line descended through Christopher Paston (who, on\r\nsucceeding his father, was found to be an idiot, incapable of managing\r\nhis affairs), Sir Edmund and Sir William Paston, Baronet, to Sir Robert\r\nPaston, who, in the reign of Charles II., was created, first Viscount\r\nand afterwards Earl of Yarmouth. [Sidenote: The Earl of Yarmouth.] He is\r\ndescribed as a person of good learning, and a traveller who brought home\r\na number of curiosities collected in foreign countries. Before he was\r\nraised to the peerage he sat in Parliament for Castle Rising. It was he\r\nwho, in the year 1664, was bold enough to propose to the House of\r\nCommons the unprecedented grant of two and a half millions to the king\r\nfor a war against the Dutch.[27-2] This act not unnaturally brought him\r\ninto favour with the Court, and paved the way for his advancement.\r\nAnother incident in his life is too remarkable to be passed over. On the\r\n9th of August 1676 he was waylaid while travelling in the night-time by\r\na band of ruffians, who shot five bullets into his coach, one of which\r\nentered his body. The wound, however, was not mortal, and he lived six\r\nyears longer.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 27-2: Clarendon’s _Life_, ii. 440.]\r\n\r\nHis relations with the Court were not altogether of good omen for his\r\nfamily. We are told that he once entertained the king and queen, and the\r\nking’s brother, James, Duke of York, with a number of the nobility, at\r\nhis family seat at Oxnead. His son, William, who became second Earl of\r\nYarmouth, married the Lady Charlotte Boyle, one of King Charles’s\r\nnatural daughters. This great alliance, and all the magnificence it\r\ninvolved, was too much for his slender fortunes. Earl William was led\r\ninto a profuse expenditure which involved him in pecuniary difficulties.\r\nHe soon deeply encumbered his inheritance; the library and the\r\ncuriosities collected by his accomplished father had to be sold. The\r\nmagnificent seat at Oxnead was allowed to fall into ruin; and on the\r\ndeath of this second earl it was pulled down, and the materials turned\r\ninto money to satisfy his creditors. The family line itself came to an\r\nend, for Earl William had survived all his male issue, and the title\r\nbecame extinct.\r\n\r\nFrom this brief summary of the family history we must now turn to a more\r\nspecific account of William Paston, the old judge in the days of Henry\r\nVI., and of his children. [Sidenote: Thrifty ancestors.] Of them, and of\r\ntheir more immediate ancestor Clement, we have a description drawn by an\r\nunfriendly hand some time after the judge’s death; and as it is,\r\nnotwithstanding its bias, our sole authority for some facts which should\r\nengage our attention at the outset, we cannot do better than quote the\r\npaper at length:--\r\n\r\n  ‘_A remembrance of the worshipful kin and ancestry of Paston, born\r\n  in Paston in Gemyngham Soken._\r\n\r\n  ‘First, There was one Clement Paston dwelling in Paston, and he was\r\n  a good, plain husband (_i.e._ husbandman), and lived upon his land\r\n  that he had in Paston, and kept thereon a plough all times in the\r\n  year, and sometimes in barlysell two ploughs. The said Clement yede\r\n  (_i.e._ went) at one plough both winter and summer, and he rode to\r\n  mill on the bare horseback with his corn under him, and brought home\r\n  meal again under him, and also drove his cart with divers corns to\r\n  Wynterton to sell, as a good husband[man] ought to do. Also, he had\r\n  in Paston a five score or a six score acres of land at the most, and\r\n  much thereof bond land to Gemyngham Hall, with a little poor\r\n  water-mill running by a little river there, as it appeareth there of\r\n  old time. Other livelode nor manors had he none there, nor in none\r\n  other place.\r\n\r\n  ‘And he wedded Geoffrey of Somerton (whose true surname is Goneld)’s\r\n  sister, which was a bondwoman, to whom it is not unknown (to the\r\n  prior of Bromholm and Bakton also, as it is said) if that men will\r\n  inquire.\r\n\r\n  ‘And as for Geoffrey Somerton, he was bond also, to whom, etc., he\r\n  was both a pardoner and an attorney; and then was a good world, for\r\n  he gathered many pence and half-pence, and therewith he made a fair\r\n  chapel at Somerton, as it appeareth, etc.\r\n\r\n  ‘Also, the said Clement had a son William, which that he set to\r\n  school, and often he borrowed money to find him to school; and after\r\n  that he yede (went) to court with the help of Geoffrey Somerton, his\r\n  uncle, and learned the law, and there begat he much good; and then\r\n  he was made a serjeant, and afterwards made a justice, and a right\r\n  cunning man in the law. And he purchased much land in Paston, and\r\n  also he purchased the moiety of the fifth part of the manor of\r\n  Bakton, called either Latymer’s, or Styward’s, or Huntingfield,\r\n  which moiety stretched into Paston; and so with it, and with another\r\n  part of the said five parts he hath seignory in Paston, but no manor\r\n  place; and thereby would John Paston, son to the said William, make\r\n  himself a lordship there, to the Duke (qu. Duchy?) of Lancaster’s\r\n  great hurt.\r\n\r\n  ‘And the said John would and hath untruly increased him by one\r\n  tenant, as where that the prior of Bromholm borrowed money of the\r\n  said William for to pay withal his dismes, the said William would\r\n  not lend it him unless the said prior would mortgage to the said\r\n  William one John Albon, the said prior’s bondsman, dwelling in\r\n  Paston, which was a stiff churl and a thrifty man, and would not\r\n  obey him unto the said William; and for that cause, and for evil\r\n  will that the said William had unto him, he desired him of the\r\n  prior. And now after the death of the said William, the said John\r\n  Albon died; and now John Paston, son to the said William, by force\r\n  of the mortgage sent for the son of the said John Albon to Norwich.’\r\n\r\nThe reader will probably be of opinion that several of the facts here\r\nrecorded are by no means so discreditable to the Pastons as the writer\r\ncertainly intended that they should appear. The object of the whole\r\npaper is to cast a stigma on the family in general, as a crafty,\r\nmoney-getting race who had risen above their natural rank and station.\r\nIt is insinuated that they were originally mere _adscripti glebæ_; that\r\nClement Paston was only a thrifty husbandman (note the original\r\nsignification of the word, ‘housebondman’), that he married a bondwoman,\r\nand transmitted to his son and grandson lands held by a servile tenure;\r\nand the writer further contends that they had no manorial rights in\r\nPaston, although William Paston, the justice, had purchased land in the\r\nneighbourhood, and his son John was endeavouring to ‘make himself a\r\nlordship’ there to the prejudice of the rights of the Duchy of\r\nLancaster. It is altogether a singular statement, very interesting in\r\nits bearing upon the obscure question of the origin of copyholds, and\r\nthe gradual emancipation of villeins. Whether it be true or false is\r\nanother question; if true, it appears to discredit entirely the supposed\r\nNorman ancestry of the Pastons; but the remarkable thing is that an\r\nimputation of this kind could have been preferred against a family who,\r\nwhatever may have been their origin, had certainly long before obtained\r\na recognised position in the county.\r\n\r\nIt would appear, however, from the accuser’s own statement, that Clement\r\nPaston, the father of the justice, was an industrious peasant, who\r\ntilled his own land, and who set so high a value on a good education\r\nthat he borrowed money to keep his son at school. With the help of his\r\nbrother-in-law, he also sent the young man to London to learn the law,\r\na profession which in that day, as in the present, was considered to\r\nafford an excellent education for a gentleman.[30-1] The good education\r\nwas not thrown away. [Sidenote: William Paston the justice.] William\r\nPaston rose in the profession and became one of its ornaments. He\r\nimproved his fortunes by marrying Agnes, daughter and heiress of Sir\r\nEdmund Berry of Harlingbury Hall, in Hertfordshire. Some years before\r\nhis father’s death, Richard Courtenay, Bishop of Norwich, appointed him\r\nhis steward. In 1414 he was called in, along with two others, to\r\nmediate in a dispute which had for some time prevailed in the city of\r\nNorwich, as to the mode in which the mayors should be elected; and\r\nhe had the good fortune with his coadjutors to adjust the matter\r\nsatisfactorily.[30-2] In 1421 he was made a serjeant, and in 1429 a\r\njudge of the Common Pleas.[30-3] Before that time we find him acting\r\nas trustee for various properties, as of the Appleyard family in\r\nDunston,[30-4] of Sir Richard Carbonel,[30-5] Sir Simon Felbrigg,[30-6]\r\nJohn Berney,[31-1] Sir John Rothenhale,[31-2] Sir John Gyney of\r\nDilham,[31-3] Lord Cobham,[31-4] and Ralph Lord Cromwell.[31-5] He was\r\nalso executor to Sir William Calthorp.[31-6] The confidence reposed in\r\nhim by so many different persons is a remarkable testimony to the esteem\r\nin which he was held. He was, moreover, appointed one of the king’s\r\ncouncil for the duchy of Lancaster, and on his elevation to the judicial\r\nbench the king gave him a salary of 110 marks (£73, 6s. 8d.), with two\r\nrobes more than the ordinary allowance of the judges.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 30-1: ‘Here everything good and virtuous is to be\r\n    learned; all vice is discouraged and banished. So that knights,\r\n    barons, and the greatest nobility of the kingdom, often place\r\n    their children in those Inns of Court; not so much to make the law\r\n    their study, much less to live by the profession (having large\r\n    patrimonies of their own), but to form their manners, and to\r\n    preserve them from the contagion of vice.’--_Fortescue de Laudibus\r\n    Legum Angliæ_ (ed. Amos), 185.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 30-2: Blomefield’s _Norfolk_, iii. 126.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 30-3: Dugdale’s _Origines_.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 30-4: Blomefield, v. 56.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 30-5: _Ibid._ ii. 257, 285; vii. 217.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 30-6: _Ibid._ viii. 109.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 31-1: Blomefield, x. 67.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 31-2: _See_ Letter 13.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 31-3: Blomefield, vi. 353.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 31-4: _Ibid._ x. 176.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 31-5: _Ibid._ v. 27.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 31-6: _Ibid._ vi. 517.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to all this he is supposed to have been a knight, and is\r\ncalled Sir William Paston in Fenn’s publication. But this dignity was\r\nnever conferred upon him in his own day. [Sidenote: Not a knight.] There\r\nis, indeed, one paper printed by Fenn from the MSS. which were for a\r\nlong time missing that speaks of him in the heading as ‘Sir William\r\nPaston, Knight’; but the original MS. since recovered shows that the\r\nheading so printed is taken from an endorsement of a more modern date.\r\nThis was, indeed, a confident surmise of mine at a time when the MS. was\r\ninaccessible; for it was clear that William Paston never could have been\r\nknighted. His name occurs over and over again on the patent rolls of\r\nHenry VI. He is named in at least one commission of the peace every year\r\nto his death, and in a good many other commissions besides, as justices\r\ninvariably were. He is named also in many of the other papers of the\r\nsame collection, simply as William Paston of Paston, Esquire; and even\r\nin the body of the petition so inaccurately headed, he is simply styled\r\nWilliam Paston, one of the justices. Nor does there appear to be any\r\nother foundation for the error than that single endorsement. He left a\r\nname behind him of so great repute, that Fuller could not help giving\r\nhim a place among his ‘Worthies of England,’ although, as he remarks, it\r\ndid not fall strictly within the plan of his work to notice a lawyer who\r\nwas neither a chief justice nor an author.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His character.] Of his personal character we are entitled to\r\nform a favourable estimate, not only from the honourable name conferred\r\non him as a judge, but also from the evidences already alluded to of the\r\ngeneral confidence felt in his integrity. True it is that among these\r\npapers we have a complaint against him for accepting fees and pensions\r\nwhen he was justice, from various persons in the counties of Norfolk and\r\nSuffolk;[32-1] but this only proves, what we might have expected, that\r\nhe had enemies and cavillers as well as friends. Of the justice of the\r\ncharges in themselves we have no means of forming an independent\r\njudgment; but in days when all England, and not least so the county of\r\nNorfolk, was full of party spirit and contention, it was not likely that\r\na man in the position of William Paston should escape imputations of\r\npartiality and one-sidedness. Before his elevation to the bench, he had\r\nalready suffered for doing his duty to more than one client. Having\r\ndefended the Prior of Norwich in an action brought against him by a\r\ncertain Walter Aslak, touching the advowson of the church of Sprouston,\r\nthe latter appears to have pursued him with unrelenting hatred. The\r\ncounty of Norfolk was at the time ringing with the news of an outrage\r\ncommitted by a band of unknown rioters at Wighton. On the last day of\r\nthe year 1423, one John Grys of Wighton had been entertaining company,\r\nand was heated with ‘wassail,’ when he was suddenly attacked in his own\r\nhouse. [Sidenote: Outrage by William Aslak.] He and his son and a\r\nservant were carried a mile from home and led to a pair of gallows,\r\nwhere it was intended to hang them; but as ropes were not at once to be\r\nhad, they were murdered in another fashion, and their bodies horribly\r\nmutilated before death.[32-2] For nearly three years the murderers went\r\nunpunished, while the country stood aghast at the crime. But while it\r\nwas still recent, at a county court holden at Norwich, Aslak caused a\r\nnumber of bills, partly in rhyme, to be posted on the gates of Norwich\r\npriory, and of the Grey Friars, and some of the city gates, distinctly\r\nthreatening William Paston with the fate of John Grys, and insinuating\r\nthat even worse things were in store for him.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 32-1: No. 25.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 32-2: _See_ No. 6. Compare J. Amundesham Annales, 16. In\r\n    the latter Grys’s Christian name is given as William, and the\r\n    outrage is said to have taken place on Christmas Day instead of\r\n    New Year’s Eve.]\r\n\r\nAgainst open threats like these William Paston of course appealed to the\r\nlaw; but law in those days was but a feeble protector. Aslak had the\r\npowerful support of Sir Thomas Erpingham, by which he was enabled not\r\nonly to evade the execution of sentence passed against him, but even to\r\ncontinue his persecution. He found means to deprive Paston of the favour\r\nof the Duke of Norfolk, got bills introduced in Parliament to his\r\nprejudice, and made it unsafe for him to stir abroad. The whole country\r\nappears to have been disorganised by faction; quarrels at that very time\r\nwere rife in the king’s council-chamber itself, between Humphrey, Duke\r\nof Gloucester, the Protector, and Bishop Beaufort; nor was anything so\r\nfirmly established by authority but that hopes might be entertained of\r\nsetting it aside by favour.\r\n\r\nWilliam Paston had two other enemies at this time. ‘I pray the Holy\r\nTrinity,’ he writes in one place, ‘deliver me of my three adversaries,\r\nthis cursed Bishop for Bromholm, Aslak for Sprouston, and Julian Herberd\r\nfor Thornham.’ The bishop whom he mentions with so much vehemence,\r\nclaimed to be a kinsman of his own, and named himself John Paston, but\r\nWilliam Paston denied the relationship, maintaining that his true name\r\nwas John Wortes. [Sidenote: John Wortes.] He appears to have been in the\r\nfirst place a monk of Bromholm, the prior of which monastery having\r\nbrought an action against him as an apostate from his order, engaged\r\nWilliam Paston as his counsel in the prosecution. Wortes, however,\r\nescaped abroad, and brought the matter before the spiritual jurisdiction\r\nof the court of Rome, bringing actions against both the prior and\r\nWilliam Paston, the latter of whom he got condemned in a penalty of\r\n£205. On this William Paston was advised by friends at Rome to come at\r\nonce to an arrangement with him; but he determined to contest the\r\nvalidity of the sentence, the result of which appears to have been that\r\nhe was excommunicated. His adversary, meanwhile, found interest to get\r\nhimself appointed and consecrated Bishop of Cork; and though his name\r\ndoes not appear in the ordinary lists of bishops of that see, the\r\nVatican archives show that he was provided to it on the 23rd May\r\n1425.[34-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 34-1: Nos. 10, 11, 12. Maziere Brady in his book on the\r\n    _Episcopal Succession_, vol. ii. p. 79, gives the following entry\r\n    from the archives of the Vatican:--\r\n\r\n    ‘Die 10{o} kal. Junii 1425, provisum est ecclesiæ Corcagen. in\r\n    Hibernia, vacanti per mortem Milis (_Milonis_), de persona Ven.\r\n    Fratris Johannis Pasten, prioris conventualis Prioratus Bromholm,\r\n    Ordinis Cluniacensis.’--_Vatican_.\r\n\r\n    Also on Sept. 14, 1425, ‘Johannes Paston, Dei gratia electus\r\n    Korkagen, solvit personaliter 120 florenos auri,’ etc.\r\n    --_Obligazioni_.]\r\n\r\n  [[Fratris Johannis Pasten ... Ordinis Cluniacensis.’\r\n  _text reads ‘Fratis ... Chuniacensis’_]]\r\n\r\nAs for Julian Herberd, William Paston’s third enemy, we have hitherto\r\nknown nothing of her but the name. It appears, however, by some Chancery\r\nproceedings[34-2] recently discovered, that Julian Herberd was a widow\r\nwho considered herself to have been wronged by Paston as regards her\r\nmother’s inheritance, of which he had kept her from the full use for no\r\nless than forty years. Paston had, indeed, made her some pecuniary\r\noffers which she did not think sufficient, and she had attempted to\r\npursue her rights against him at a Parliament at Westminster, when he\r\ncaused her to be imprisoned in the King’s Bench. There, as she\r\ngrievously complains, she lay a year, suffering much and ‘nigh dead from\r\ncold, hunger, and thirst.’ The case was apparently one of parliamentary\r\nprivilege, which she had violated by her attempted action, though she\r\nadds that he threatened to keep her in prison for life if she would not\r\nrelease to him her right, and give him a full acquittance. She also\r\naccuses him of having actually procured one from her by coercion, and of\r\nhaving by false suggestion to the Lord Chancellor caused her committal\r\nto the Fleet, where she was kept for a whole year, ‘beaten, fettered,\r\nand stocked,’ that no man might know where she was. At another time,\r\nalso, she says he kept her three years in the pit within Norwich Castle\r\non starvation diet. The accusation culminates in a charge which seems\r\nreally inconceivable:--\r\n\r\n  ‘Item, the said Paston did bring her out of the Round House into\r\n  your Palace and brought her afore your Chief Justice, and then the\r\n  said Paston commanded certain persons to bring her to prison to your\r\n  Bench, and bade at his peril certain persons to smite the brain out\r\n  of her head for suing of her right; and there being in grievous\r\n  prison during half year and more, fettered and chained, suffering\r\n  cold, hunger, thirst, in point of death, God and ye, gracious King,\r\n  help her to her right.’\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 34-2: Printed in Appendix to this introduction.]\r\n\r\nWhat we are to think of all this, not having Paston’s reply, I cannot\r\nsay.\r\n\r\nScanty and disconnected as are the notices we possess of William Paston,\r\nwe must not pass by without comment his letter to the vicar of the abbot\r\nof Clugny, in behalf of Bromholm Priory.[35-1] It was not, indeed, the\r\nonly occasion[35-2] on which we find that he exerted himself in behalf\r\nof this ancient monastery, within a mile of which, he tells us, he was\r\nborn. [Sidenote: Bromholm Priory.] Bromholm Priory was, in fact, about\r\nthat distance from Paston Hall, as miles were reckoned then (though it\r\nis nearer two of our statute miles), and must have been regarded with\r\nspecial interest by the family. It was there that John Paston, the son\r\nof the judge, was sumptuously buried in the reign of Edward IV. It was a\r\nmonastery of some celebrity. Though not, at least in its latter days,\r\none of the most wealthy religious houses, for it fell among the smaller\r\nmonasteries at the first parliamentary suppression of Henry VIII., its\r\nruins still attest that it was by no means insignificant. Situated by\r\nthe sea-shore, with a flat, unbroken country round about, they are\r\nconspicuous from a distance both by sea and land. Among the numerous\r\nmonasteries of Norfolk, none but Walsingham was more visited by\r\nstrangers, and many of the pilgrims to Walsingham turned aside on their\r\nway homeward to visit the Rood of Bromholm. For this was a very special\r\ntreasure brought from Constantinople two hundred years before, and\r\ncomposed of a portion of the wood of the true Cross. Many were the\r\nmiracles recorded to have been wrought in the monastery since that\r\nprecious relic was set up; the blind had received their sight, the lame\r\nhad walked, and lepers had been cleansed; even the dead had been\r\nrestored to life. It was impossible that a native of Paston could be\r\nuninterested in a place so renowned throughout all England.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 35-1: No. 20.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 35-2: _See_ No. 47, p. 56.]\r\n\r\nYet about this time the priory must have been less prosperous than it\r\nhad once been. Its government and constitution were in a transition\r\nstate. It was one of the twenty-eight monasteries in England which\r\nbelonged to the Cluniac order, and were originally subject to the\r\nvisitation of the Abbot of Clugny in France. Subjection to a foreign\r\nhead did not tend at any time to make them popular in this country, and\r\nin the reign of Henry V. that connection was suddenly broken off. An act\r\nwas passed suppressing at once all the alien priories, or religious\r\nhouses that acknowledged foreign superiors. The priors of several of the\r\nCluniac monasteries took out new foundation charters, and attached\r\nthemselves to other orders. Those that continued signed deeds of\r\nsurrender, and their monasteries were taken into the king’s hands. About\r\nnine or ten years later, however, it would seem that a vicar of the\r\nAbbot of Clugny was allowed to visit England, and to him William Paston\r\nmade an appeal to profess in due form a number of virtuous young men who\r\nhad joined the priory in the interval.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Land purchased by Judge Paston.] From the statement already\r\nquoted as to the history of the Paston family, it appears that William\r\nPaston purchased a good deal of land in Paston besides what had\r\noriginally belonged to them. It was evidently his intention to make a\r\nfamily residence, and transmit to his sons a more absolute ownership in\r\nthe land from which they derived their name. Much of his father’s land\r\nin Paston had been copyhold belonging to the manor of Gimingham Hall;\r\nbut William Paston bought ‘a moiety of the fifth part’ of the adjacent\r\nmanor of Bacton, with free land extending into Paston. He thus\r\nestablished himself as undoubted lord of the greater part of the soil,\r\nand must have felt a pardonable pride in the improved position he\r\nthereby bequeathed to his descendants. At Paston he apparently\r\ncontemplated building a manor house; for he made inquiry about getting\r\nstone from Yorkshire conveyed by sea to Mundesley, where there was then\r\na small harbour[36-1] within two miles of Paston village. To carry out\r\nthe improvements [Sidenote: Highways diverted.] he proposed to make\r\nthere and on other parts of his property, he obtained licence from the\r\nking a year before his death to divert two public highways, the one at\r\nPaston and the other at Oxnead, a little from their course.[36-2] The\r\nalterations do not appear to have been of a nature that any one had a\r\nright to complain of. Full inquiry was made beforehand by an inquisition\r\n_ad quod damnum_[37-1] whether they would be to the prejudice of\r\nneighbours. At Paston the extent of roadway which he obtained leave to\r\nenclose was only thirty-two and a half perches in length by one perch in\r\nbreadth. It ran on the south side of his mansion, and he agreed to make\r\na new highway of the same dimensions on the north side. The vicar of\r\nPaston seems to have been the neighbour principally concerned in the\r\ncourse that the new thoroughfare was to take, and all particulars had\r\nbeen arranged with him a few months before William Paston died.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 36-1: No. 7.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 36-2: Patent 6th July, 21 Henry VI., p. 1, m. 10.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 37-1: _Inquis. a. q. d._ (arranged with _Inquisitions\r\n    post-mortem_), 21 Henry VI., No. 53.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John Paston has disputes with his neighbours.] But it would\r\nseem upon the judge’s death his great designs were for some time\r\ninterrupted. The family were looked upon by many as upstarts, and young\r\nJohn Paston, who was only four-and-twenty, though bred to the law like\r\nhis father, could not expect to possess the same weight and influence\r\nwith his neighbours. A claim was revived by the lord of Gimingham Hall\r\nto a rent of eight shillings from one of Paston’s tenants, which had\r\nnever been demanded so long as the judge was alive. The vicar of Paston\r\npulled up the ‘doles’ which were set to mark the new highway, and\r\nvarious other disturbances were committed by the neighbours. It seems to\r\nhave required all the energies not only of John Paston upon the spot,\r\nbut also of his brother Edmund, who was in London at Clifford’s Inn, to\r\nsecure the rights of the family; insomuch that their mother, in writing\r\nto the latter of the opposition to which they had been exposed,\r\nexpresses a fear lest she should make him weary of Paston.[37-2] And,\r\nindeed, if Edmund Paston was not weary of the dispute, his mother\r\nherself had cause to be; for it not only lasted years after this, but\r\nfor some years after Edmund Paston was dead the stopping of the king’s\r\nhighway was a fruitful theme of remonstrance. When Agnes Paston built a\r\nwall it was thrown down before it was half completed; threats of heavy\r\namercements were addressed to her in church, and the men of Paston spoke\r\nof showing their displeasure when they went in public procession on St.\r\nMark’s day.[37-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 37-2: Letter 62.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 37-3: Nos. 194, 195, 196.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oxnead.] The Manor of Oxnead, which in later times became the\r\nprincipal seat of the family, was also among the possessions purchased\r\nby Judge Paston. He bought it of William Clopton of Long Melford, and\r\nsettled it upon Agnes, his wife. But after his death her right to it was\r\ndisputed. It had formerly belonged to a family of the name of Hauteyn,\r\nand there suddenly started up a claimant in the person of one John\r\nHauteyn, whose right to hold property of any kind was [Sidenote: John\r\nHauteyn.] supposed to have been entirely annulled by the fact of his\r\nhaving entered the Order of Carmelite Friars. It seems, however, he had\r\nsucceeded in getting from the Pope a dispensation to renounce the Order\r\non the plea that he had been forced into it against his will when he was\r\nunder age, and being thus restored by the ecclesiastical power to the\r\ncondition of a layman, he next appealed to the civil courts to get back\r\nhis inheritance. This danger must have been seen by William Paston\r\nbefore his death, and a paper was drawn up (No. 46) to show that Hauteyn\r\nhad been released from his vows on false pretences. Nevertheless he\r\npursued his claim at law, and although he complained of the difficulty\r\nof getting counsel (owing, as he himself intimated, to the respect in\r\nwhich the bar held the memory of Judge Paston, and the fact that his son\r\nJohn was one of their own members), he seems to have had hopes of\r\nsucceeding through the influence of the Duke of Suffolk. His suit,\r\nhowever, had not been brought to a successful determination at the date\r\nof Suffolk’s fall. It was still going on in the succeeding summer; but\r\nas we hear no more of it after that, we may presume that the altered\r\nstate of the political world induced him to abandon it. According to\r\nBlomefield, he and others of the Hauteyn family released their rights to\r\nAgnes Paston ‘about 1449’; but this date is certainly at least a year\r\ntoo early.[38-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 38-1: Nos. 63, 87, 93, 128; Blomefield, vi. 479.]\r\n\r\nWilliam Paston also purchased various other lands in the county of\r\nNorfolk.[38-2] Among others, he purchased from Thomas Chaucer, a son of\r\nthe famous poet, the manor of Gresham,[39-1] of which we shall have\r\nsomething more to say a little later. We also find that in the fourth\r\nyear of Henry VI. he obtained, in conjunction with one Thomas Poye,\r\na grant of a market, fair and free-warren in his manor of Shipden which\r\nhad belonged to his father Clement before him.[39-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 38-2: It would appear that he had also an estate at\r\n    Therfield, in Hertfordshire, as shown by an inscription in the\r\n    east window of the north aisle of the parish church, in which were\r\n    portraits of himself and his wife underwritten with the words,\r\n    _Orate pro animabus domini Willelmi Paston et Agnetis uxoris ejus,\r\n    benefactorum hujus ecclesiæ_ (Chauncey’s _Hertfordshire_, 88).]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 39-1: Blomefield, viii. 127.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 39-2: _Patent Roll_, 4 Henry VI., p. 2, m. 13;\r\n    Blomefield, viii. 102. A further notice relating to Judge Paston\r\n    has been given me by Sir James Ramsay in the following\r\n    memorandum:--‘£432 for arrears of salary due to late William\r\n    Paston, paid to his executor, John Paston, from _parva custuma_ of\r\n    the port of London. L.T.R. Enrolled Customs Account of Henry VI.\r\n    (entry 8 Nov. 37 Hen. VI.--Mich. 38 Hen. VI.)’ in Public Record\r\n    Office. So the arrears of the judge’s salary were only paid in\r\n    1458, fourteen years after his death.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John Paston’s marriage.] The notices of John Paston begin\r\nwhen he was on the eve of marrying, a few years before his father’s\r\ndeath. The match was evidently one that was arranged by the parents,\r\nafter the fashion of the times. The lady was of a good family--daughter\r\nand heiress of John Mauteby, Esq. of Mauteby in Norfolk. The friends on\r\nboth sides must have been satisfied that the union was a good one; for\r\nit had the one great merit which was then considered everything--it was\r\nno disparagement to the fortunes or the rank of either family. Beyond\r\nthis hard business view, indeed, might have been found better arguments\r\nto recommend it; but English men and women in those days did not read\r\nnovels, and had no great notion of cultivating sentiment for its own\r\nsake. Agnes Paston writes to her husband to intimate ‘the bringing home\r\nof the gentlewoman from Reedham,’ according to the arrangement he had\r\nmade about it. It was, in her words, ‘the first acquaintance between\r\nJohn Paston and the said gentlewoman’ (one would think Dame Agnes must\r\nhave learned from her husband to express herself with something of the\r\nformality of a lawyer); and we are glad to find that the young lady’s\r\nsense of propriety did not spoil her natural affability. ‘She made him\r\ngentle cheer in gentle wise, and said he was verily your son; and so I\r\nhope there shall need no great treaty between them.’ Finally the judge\r\nis requested by his wife to buy a gown for his future daughter-in-law,\r\nto which her mother would add a goodly fur. ‘The gown,’ says Dame Agnes,\r\n‘needeth for to be had; and of colour it would be a goodly blue, or else\r\na bright sanguine.’[40-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 40-1: No. 34.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of his wife.] ‘The gentlewoman’ thus introduced to\r\nJohn Paston and the reader proved to the former a most devoted wife\r\nduring about six-and-twenty years of married life. Her letters to her\r\nhusband form no inconsiderable portion of the correspondence in these\r\nvolumes, and it is impossible to peruse them without being convinced\r\nthat the writer was a woman not only of great force of character, but of\r\ntruly affectionate nature. It is true the ordinary style of these\r\nepistles is very different from that of wives addressing their husbands\r\nnowadays. There are no conventional expressions of tenderness--the\r\nconventionality of the age seems to have required not tenderness but\r\nhumility on the part of women towards the head of a family; the subjects\r\nof the letters, too, are for the most part matters of pure business; yet\r\nthe genuine womanly nature is seen bursting out whenever there is\r\noccasion to call it forth. Very early in the correspondence we meet with\r\na letter of hers (No. 47) which in itself is pretty sufficient evidence\r\nthat women, at least, were human in the fifteenth century. Her husband\r\nwas at the time in London just beginning to recover from an illness\r\nwhich seems to have been occasioned by some injury he had met with. His\r\nmother had vowed to give an image of wax the weight of himself to Our\r\nLady of Walsingham on his recovery, and Margaret to go on a pilgrimage\r\nthither, and also to St. Leonard’s at Norwich. That she did not\r\nundertake a journey of a hundred miles to do more efficient service was\r\ncertainly not owing to any want of will on her part. The difficulties of\r\ntravelling in those days, and the care of a young child, sufficiently\r\naccount for her remaining in Norfolk; but apparently even these\r\nconsiderations would not have deterred her from the journey had she not\r\nbeen dissuaded from it by others. ‘If I might have had my will,’ she\r\nwrites, ‘I should have seen you ere this time. I would ye were at home,\r\nif it were for your ease (and your sore might be as well looked to here\r\nas it is there ye be), now liever than a gown, though it were of\r\nscarlet.’ Could the sincerity of a woman’s wishes be more artlessly\r\nexpressed?\r\n\r\nLet not the reader suppose, however, that Margaret Paston’s acknowledged\r\nlove of a scarlet gown indicates anything like frivolity of character or\r\ninordinate love of display. We have little reason to believe from her\r\ncorrespondence that dress was a ruling passion. The chief aim\r\ndiscernible in all she writes--the chief motive that influenced\r\neverything she did--was simply the desire to give her husband\r\nsatisfaction. And her will to do him service was, in general, only\r\nequalled by her ability. During term time, when John Paston was in\r\nLondon, she was his agent at home. It was she who negotiated with\r\nfarmers, receiving overtures for leases and threats of lawsuits, and\r\nreported to her husband everything that might affect his interests, with\r\nthe news of the country generally. Nor were threats always the worst\r\nthing she had to encounter on his account. For even domestic life, in\r\nthose days, was not always exempt from violence; and there were at least\r\ntwo occasions when Margaret had to endure, in her husband’s absence,\r\nthings that a woman ought to have been spared.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Manor of Gresham.] One of these occasions we proceed to\r\nnotice. The manor of Gresham, which William Paston had purchased from\r\nthe son of the poet Chaucer, had been in the days of Edward II. the\r\nproperty of one Edmund Bacon, who obtained from that king a licence to\r\nembattle the manor-house. It descended from him to his two daughters,\r\nMargaret and Margery. The former became the wife of Sir William de\r\nKerdeston, and her rights were inherited by a daughter named Maud, who\r\nmarried Sir John Burghersh.[41-1] This moiety came to Thomas Chaucer by\r\nhis marriage with Maud Burghersh, the daughter of the Maud just\r\nmentioned. The other became at first the property of Sir William\r\nMolynes, who married Bacon’s second daughter Margery. But this Margery\r\nhaving survived her husband, made a settlement of it by will, according\r\nto which the reversion of it after the decease of one Philip Vache and\r\nof Elizabeth his wife, was to be sold; and William, son of Robert\r\nMolynes, was to have the first option of purchase. This William Molynes\r\nat first declined to buy it, being apparently in want of funds; but he\r\nafterwards got one Thomas Fauconer, a London merchant, to advance the\r\npurchase-money, on an agreement that his son should marry Fauconer’s\r\ndaughter. The marriage, however, never took effect; the Molynes family\r\nlost all claim upon the manor, and the same Thomas Chaucer who acquired\r\nthe other moiety by his wife, purchased this moiety also, and conveyed\r\nboth to William Paston.[42-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 41-1: _Inquisitions post-mortem_, 27 Edw. III., No. 28,\r\n    and 30 Edw. III., No. 42. Blomefield inaccurately makes Maud,\r\n    whom Sir John Burghersh married, the daughter of Edmond Bacon\r\n    instead of his granddaughter.--(_Hist. of Norf._ viii. 127.)]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 42-1: No. 16. Blomefield gives a somewhat different\r\n    account, founded doubtless on documents to which I have not had\r\n    access. He says that Margery, widow of Sir William Molynes,\r\n    settled her portion of the manor on one Thomas de la Lynde, with\r\n    the consent of her son Sir William Molynes, who resigned all claim\r\n    to it.]\r\n\r\n  [[Footnote 41-1: _Inquisitions post-mortem_, 27 Edw. III.,\r\n  _comma after “III.” missing_]]\r\n\r\nThe whole manor of Gresham thus descended to John Paston, as his\r\nfather’s heir. But a few years after his father’s death he was troubled\r\nin the possession of it by Robert Hungerford, son of Lord Hungerford,\r\nwho, having married Eleanor Molynes, a descendant of the Sir William\r\nMolynes above referred to, had been raised to the peerage as Lord\r\nMolynes,and laid claim to the whole inheritance of the [Sidenote:\r\nClaimed by Lord Molynes.] Molynes family. He was still but a young\r\nman,[42-2] heir-apparent to another barony; and, with the prospect of a\r\ngreat inheritance both from his father and from his mother, who was the\r\ndaughter and sole heir of William Lord Botraux, he certainly had little\r\noccasion to covet lands that were not his own. Nevertheless he listened\r\nto the counsels of John Heydon of Baconsthorpe, a lawyer who had been\r\nsheriff and also recorder of Norwich, and whom the gentry of Norfolk\r\nlooked upon with anything but goodwill, regarding him as the ready tool\r\nof every powerful oppressor. His chief patron, with whom his name was\r\nconstantly coupled, was Sir Thomas Tuddenham; and the two together,\r\nespecially during the unpopular ministry of the Duke of Suffolk,\r\nexercised an ascendency in the county, of which we hear very numerous\r\ncomplaints. Heydon persuaded Lord Molynes that he had a good claim to\r\nthe manor of Gresham; and Lord Molynes, without more ado, went in and\r\ntook possession on the 17th of February 1448.[43-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 42-2: According to the inquisition taken on his father’s\r\n    death (_Inq. p. m._, 37 Hen. VI., No. 17), he was over thirty in\r\n    June 1459. If we are to understand that he was then only in his\r\n    thirty-first year, he could not have been twenty when he first\r\n    dispossessed John Paston of Gresham. But ‘over thirty’ may perhaps\r\n    mean two or three years over.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 43-1: No. 102.]\r\n\r\nTo recover his rights against a powerful young nobleman connected with\r\nvarious wealthy and influential families required, as John Paston knew,\r\nthe exercise of great discretion. Instead of resorting at once to an\r\naction at law, he made representations to Lord Molynes and his legal\r\nadvisers to show how indefensible was the title they had set up for him.\r\nHe secured some attention for his remonstrances by the intercession of\r\nWaynflete, bishop of Winchester.[43-2] Conferences took place between\r\nthe counsel of both parties during the following summer, and the\r\nweakness of Lord Molynes’ case was practically confessed by his\r\nsolicitors, who in the end told Paston to apply to his lordship\r\npersonally. Paston accordingly, at no small expense to himself, went and\r\nwaited upon him at Salisbury and elsewhere, but was continually put off.\r\nAt last, on the 6th of October, not, as I believe, the same year, but\r\nthe year following, he succeeded in doing to Lord Molynes to some extent\r\nwhat Lord Molynes had already done to him. He took possession of ‘a\r\nmansion within the said town,’ and occupied it himself, having doubtless\r\na sufficiency of servants to guard against any sudden surprise. After\r\nthis fashion he maintained his rights for a period of over three months.\r\nThe usual residence of Lord Molynes was in Wiltshire, and his agents\r\nprobably did not like the responsibility of attempting to remove John\r\nPaston without express orders from their master. But on the 28th of\r\nJanuary 1450, while John Paston was away in London on business, there\r\ncame before the mansion at Gresham a company of a thousand persons, sent\r\nto recover possession for Lord Molynes. They were armed with cuirasses\r\nand brigandines, with guns, bows, and arrows, and with every kind of\r\noffensive and defensive armour. They had also mining instruments, long\r\npoles with hooks, called cromes, used for pulling down houses, ladders,\r\npickaxes, and pans with fire burning in them. With these formidable\r\nimplements they beset the house, at that time occupied only by Margaret\r\nPaston and twelve other persons; and having broken open the outer gates,\r\nthey set to work undermining the very chamber in which Margaret was.\r\nResistance under the circumstances was impossible. Margaret was forcibly\r\ncarried out. The house was then thoroughly rifled of all that it\r\ncontained--property estimated by John Paston at £200[44-1]--the\r\ndoorposts were cut asunder, and the place was left little better than a\r\nruin. Further, that there might be no mistake about the spirit in which\r\nthe outrage was perpetrated, the rioters declared openly, that if they\r\nhad found John Paston, or his friend John Damme, who had aided him with\r\nhis counsel about these matters, neither of them should have escaped\r\nalive.[44-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 43-2: No. 79.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 44-1: A value probably equal to about £3000 of our\r\n    money.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 44-2: Nos. 102, 135.]\r\n\r\nJohn Paston drew up a petition for redress to Parliament, and another to\r\nthe Lord Chancellor; but it was some months before his case could be\r\nattended to, for that year was one of confusion and disorder\r\nunparalleled. It was that year, in fact, which may be said to have\r\nwitnessed the first outbreak of a long, intermittent civil war. History\r\nhas not passed over in silence the troubles of 1450. [Sidenote: Troubled\r\ntimes, A.D. 1450.] The rebellion of Jack Cade, and the murder of two\r\nbishops in different parts of the country, were facts which no historian\r\ncould treat as wholly insignificant. Many writers have even repeated the\r\nold slander, which there seems no good reason to believe, that Jack\r\nCade’s insurrection was promoted by the intrigues of the Duke of York;\r\nbut no one appears to me to have realised the precise nature of the\r\ncrisis that necessarily followed the removal of the Duke of Suffolk. And\r\nas we have now arrived at the point where the Paston Letters begin to\r\nhave a most direct bearing on English history, we must endeavour in a\r\nfew words of historical retrospect to make the matter as clear as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Duke of Suffolk_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of the Duke of Suffolk.] As to the causes of Suffolk’s\r\nfall we are not left in ignorance. Not only do we possess the full text\r\nof the long indictment drawn up against him this year in Parliament, but\r\na number of political ballads and satires, in which he is continually\r\nspoken of by the name of Jack Napes, help us to realise the feeling with\r\nwhich he was generally regarded. Of his real merits as a statesman, it\r\nis hard to pronounce an opinion; for though, obviously enough, his whole\r\npolicy was a failure, he himself seems to have been aware from the first\r\nthat it was not likely to be popular. Two great difficulties he had to\r\ncontend with, each sufficient to give serious anxiety to any minister\r\nwhatever: the first being the utter weakness of the king’s character;\r\nthe second, the practical impossibility of maintaining the English\r\nconquests in France. To secure both himself and the nation against the\r\nuncertainties which might arise from the vacillating counsels of one who\r\nseems hardly ever to have been able to judge for himself in State\r\naffairs, he may have thought it politic to ally the king with a woman of\r\nstronger will than his own. At all events, if this was his intention, he\r\ncertainly achieved it. The marriage of Henry with Margaret of Anjou was\r\nhis work; and from Margaret he afterwards obtained a protection which he\r\nwould certainly not have received from her well-intentioned but\r\nfeeble-minded husband.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The king’s marriage.] This marriage undoubtedly recommended\r\nitself to Henry himself as a great means of promoting peace with France.\r\nThe pious, humane, and Christian character of the king disposed him\r\nfavourably towards all pacific counsels, and gave him a high opinion of\r\nthe statesman whose policy most obviously had in view the termination of\r\nthe disastrous war between France and England. King René, the father of\r\nMargaret of Anjou, was the brother of the French king’s consort; so it\r\nwas conceived that by his and Margaret’s intercession a permanent peace\r\nmight be obtained, honourable to both countries. For this end, Henry was\r\nwilling to relinquish his barren title to the kingdom of France, if he\r\ncould have been secured in the possession of those lands only, such as\r\nGuienne and Normandy, which he held irrespective of that title.[45-1] He\r\nwas willing to relinquish even the duchies of Anjou and Maine, King\r\nRené’s patrimony, though the latter had long been in the possession of\r\nthe English. It was of course out of the question that Henry should\r\ncontinue to keep the father of his bride by force out of his own lands.\r\nSuffolk therefore promised to give them up to the French king, for the\r\nuse of René and his brother, Charles of Anjou; so that instead of the\r\nformer giving his daughter a dower, England was called upon to part with\r\nsome of her conquests. But how would the English nation reconcile itself\r\nto such a condition? Suffolk knew well he was treading in a dangerous\r\npath, and took every possible precaution to secure himself. He pleaded\r\nbeforehand his own incompetency for the charge that was committed to\r\nhim. He urged that his familiarity with the Duke of Orleans and other\r\nFrench prisoners lately detained in England brought him under suspicion\r\nat home, and rendered him a less fitting ambassador for arranging\r\nmatters with France. Finally he obtained from the King and Council an\r\ninstrument under the Great Seal, pardoning him beforehand any error of\r\njudgment he might possibly commit in conducting so critical a\r\nnegotiation.[46-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 45-1: Stevenson’s _Wars of the English in France_, i.\r\n    132.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 46-1: Rymer, xi. 53.]\r\n\r\nHis success, if judged by the immediate result, seemed to show that so\r\nmuch diffidence was unnecessary. The people at large rejoiced in the\r\nmarriage of their king; the bride, if poor, was beautiful and\r\nattractive; the negotiator received the thanks of Parliament,\r\nand there was not a man in all the kingdom,--at least in all the\r\nlegislature--durst wag his tongue in censure. The Duke of Gloucester,\r\nhis chief rival and opponent in the senate, was the first to rise from\r\nhis seat and recommend Suffolk, for his services, to the favour of the\r\nCrown.[46-2] If he had really committed any mistakes, they were as yet\r\nunknown, or at all events uncriticised. Even the cession of Maine and\r\nAnjou at this time does not seem to have been spoken of.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 46-2: _Rolls of Parl._ v. 73. That Gloucester secretly\r\n    disliked Suffolk’s policy, and thought the peace with France too\r\n    dearly bought, is more than probable. At the reception of the\r\n    French ambassadors in 1445, we learn from their report that Henry\r\n    looked exceedingly pleased, especially when his uncle the French\r\n    king was mentioned. ‘And on his left hand were my Lord of\r\n    Gloucester, at whom he looked at the time, and then he turned\r\n    round to the right to the chancellor, and the Earl of Suffolk, and\r\n    the Cardinal of York, who were there, smiling to them, and it was\r\n    very obvious that he made some signal. And it was afterwards\r\n    mentioned by-------- (_blank in orig._), that he pressed his\r\n    Chancellor’s hand and said to him in English, “I am very much\r\n    rejoiced that some who are present should hear these words. They\r\n    are not at their ease.”’--Stevenson’s _Wars of the English in\r\n    France_, i. 110-11.]\r\n\r\nHappy in the confidence of his sovereign, Suffolk was promoted to more\r\ndistinguished honour. From an earl he was raised to the dignity of a\r\nmarquis; from a marquisate, a few years later, to a dukedom. He had\r\nalready supplanted older statesmen with far greater advantages of birth\r\nand pre-eminence of rank. [Sidenote: Suffolk’s ascendency.] The two\r\ngreat rivals, Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, and Cardinal Beaufort, were\r\nboth eclipsed, and both died, within six weeks of each other, two years\r\nafter the king’s marriage, leaving Suffolk the only minister of mark.\r\nBut his position was not improved by this undisputed ascendency.\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1447.] The death of Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester,\r\naroused suspicions in the public mind that were perhaps due merely to\r\ntime and circumstance. Duke Humphrey, with many defects in his\r\ncharacter, had always been a popular favourite, and just before his\r\ndeath he had been arrested on a charge of treason. That he could not\r\npossibly have remained quiet under the new _régime_ is a fact that we\r\nmight presume as a matter of course, but there is no clear evidence that\r\nhe was guilty of intrigue or conspiracy. The king, indeed, appears to\r\nhave thought he was so, but his opinions were formed by those of Suffolk\r\nand the Queen; and both Suffolk and the Queen were such enemies of Duke\r\nHumphrey, that they were vehemently suspected of having procured his\r\ndeath.[47-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 47-1: An interesting and valuable account of the death\r\n    of Duke Humphrey, from original sources, will be found in _The\r\n    Hall of Lawford Hall_, pp. 104-13.]\r\n\r\nComplaints against the minister now began to be made more openly, and\r\nhis conduct touching the surrender of Anjou and Maine was so generally\r\ncensured, that he petitioned the king that a day might be appointed on\r\nwhich he should have an opportunity of clearing himself before the\r\nCouncil. On the 25th of May 1447 his wish was granted, and in the\r\npresence of a full Council, including the Duke of York, and others who\r\nmight have been expected to be no very favourable critics, he gave a\r\ndetailed account of all that he had done. How far he made a really\r\nfavourable impression upon his hearers we do not know; but in the end he\r\nwas declared to have vindicated his integrity, and a proclamation was\r\nissued forbidding the circulation of such slanders against him in\r\nfuture, under penalty of the king’s displeasure.[48-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 48-1: Rymer, xi. 173.]\r\n\r\nThe nature of the defence that he set up can only be a matter of\r\nspeculation; but it may be observed that as yet no formal delivery of\r\nAnjou or Maine had really taken place at all. The former province,\r\nthough it had been before this overrun and laid waste by the English,\r\ndoes not appear ever to have been permanently occupied by them. Delivery\r\nof Anjou would therefore have been an idle form; all that was required\r\nwas that the English should forbear to invade it. But with Maine the\r\ncase was different. It had been for a long time in the hands of the\r\nEnglish, and pledges had certainly been given for its delivery by\r\nSuffolk and by Henry himself in December 1445.[48-2] As yet, however,\r\nnothing had been concluded by way of positive treaty. No definite peace\r\nhad been made with France. Difficulties had always started up in the\r\nnegotiations, and the ambassadors appointed on either side had been\r\nunable to do more than prolong from time to time the existing truce,\r\nleaving the matter in dispute to be adjusted at a personal interview\r\nbetween the two kings, for which express provision was made at the time\r\nof each new arrangement. But the personal interview never took place. In\r\nAugust 1445 it was arranged for the following summer. In January 1446 it\r\nwas fixed to be before November. In February 1447 it was again to be in\r\nthe summer following. In July it was settled to be before May 1448; but\r\nin October the time was again lengthened further.[48-3] There can be\r\nlittle doubt that these perpetual delays were due merely to hesitation\r\non the part of England to carry out a policy to which she was already\r\npledged. Charles, of course, could not allow them to go on for ever. In\r\nthe treaty of July 1447, an express provision was for the first time\r\ninserted, that the town and castle of Le Mans, and other places within\r\nthe county of Maine, should be delivered up to the French. It seems also\r\nto have been privately arranged that this should be done before the 1st\r\nof November; and that the further treaty made at Bourges on the 15th of\r\nOctober should not be published until the surrender was\r\naccomplished.[49-1] But the year 1447 had very nearly expired before\r\neven the first steps were taken to give effect to this arrangement. At\r\nlength, on the 30th of December, an agreement was made by Matthew Gough,\r\nwho had the keeping of Le Mans, that the place should be surrendered by\r\nthe 15th of January, on receipt of letters patent from the King of\r\nFrance, for compensation to be made to grantees of the English crown.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 48-2: _See_ Stevenson’s _Wars of the English in France_,\r\n    ii. [639] to [642].]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 48-3: Rymer, xi. 97, 108, 151, 182, 189, etc.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 49-1: Stevenson’s _Wars_, ii. [714, 715].]\r\n\r\nEven this arrangement, however, was not adhered to. Matthew Gough still\r\nfound reasons for refusing or delaying the surrender, although the\r\nEnglish Government protested the sincerity of its intentions. But\r\nCharles now began to take the matter into his own hands. [Sidenote:\r\nSiege of Le Mans, A.D. 1448.] Count Dunois and others were sent to\r\nbesiege the place, with a force raised suddenly out of various towns;\r\nfor France had been carefully maturing, during those years of truce,\r\na system of conscription which was now becoming serviceable. At the first\r\nrumour of these musters the English Government was alarmed, and Sir\r\nThomas Hoo, Lord Hastings, Henry’s Chancellor of France, wrote urgently\r\nto Pierre de Brézé, seneschal of Poitou, who had been the chief\r\nnegotiator of the existing truce, deprecating the use of force against\r\na town which it was the full intention of his Government to yield up\r\nhonourably.[49-2] Such protests, however, availed nothing in the face\r\nof the obvious fact that the surrender had not taken place at the time\r\nagreed on. The French continued to muster forces. In great haste an\r\nembassy was despatched from England, consisting of Adam de Moleyns,\r\nBishop of Chichester, and Sir Thomas Roos; but the conduct of the\r\ngarrison itself rendered further negotiation nugatory. By no means could\r\nthey be induced, even in obedience to their own king, to surrender the\r\ncity peacefully. Dunois and his army accordingly drew nearer. Three\r\nsharp skirmishes took place before the siege could be formed; but at\r\nlength the garrison were fully closed in. All that they could now do was\r\nto make a composition with the enemy; yet even this they would not have\r\nattempted of themselves. The efforts of the English envoys, however,\r\nsecured for the besieged most favourable terms of surrender. Not only\r\nwere they permitted to march out with bag and baggage, but a sum of\r\nmoney was delivered to each of the captains, by the French king’s\r\norders; with which, and a safe-conduct from Charles, they departed into\r\nNormandy.[50-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 49-2: Stevenson’s _Wars_, i. 198. _See_ also a letter of\r\n    the 18th Feb. 1448, of which an abstract is given in vol. ii. of\r\n    the same work, p. 576.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 50-1: _Chron. de Mat. de Coussy_ (in Buchon’s\r\n    collection), p. 34.]\r\n\r\nIt was on Friday, the 15th of March 1448, the day on which the truce\r\nbetween the two countries was to have expired, that the brave Matthew\r\nGough, along with his colleague, Fulk Eton, formally delivered up to the\r\nFrench, not only the town and castle of Le Mans, but also the whole\r\ncounty of Maine except the lordship of Fresnay. [Sidenote: Its\r\nsurrender.] Standing on the outer bridge, they made a public protest\r\nbefore their soldiers, and caused a notary to witness it by a formal\r\ndocument, that what they did was only in obedience to their own king’s\r\ncommands, and that the king himself, in giving up possession of the\r\ncounty of Maine, by no means parted with his sovereign rights therein;\r\nthat he only gave up actual possession in order that King René and his\r\nbrother, Charles of Anjou, might enjoy the fruits of their own lands,\r\nand in the hope that a firm peace might be established between England\r\nand France. Four days before this was done the truce had been prolonged\r\nfor two years more.[50-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 50-2: Rymer, xi. 199, 204. Stevenson’s _Wars_, i. 207.]\r\n\r\nThe reluctant cession of such a valuable province as Maine boded ill for\r\nthe security of the neighbouring duchy of Normandy. The government of\r\nNormandy was at this time committed to Edmund Beaufort, Marquis of\r\nDorset, who had just been created Duke of Somerset. His appointment to\r\nthe post had been due rather to favour than to merit. The Duke of York\r\nwas then Regent of France, and had given good proof of his competence to\r\ntake charge of the entire kingdom. But Somerset, who was head of the\r\nhouse of Beaufort, nearly allied in blood to the Crown, and who had come\r\ninto possession of immense wealth by the death of his uncle, the\r\nCardinal of Winchester, had the ambition of an Englishman to show his\r\ntalent for governing. His influence with the king and Suffolk obtained\r\nfor him the government of Normandy; and that he might exercise it\r\nundisturbed, York was recalled from France. The change was ill advised;\r\nfor the times demanded the best of generalship, and the utmost political\r\ndiscretion. Somerset, though not without experience in war, had given no\r\nevidence of the possession of such qualities; and they had been\r\nnotoriously wanting in his brother John, who was Duke of Somerset before\r\nhim, when his ambition, too, had been gratified by a command in France.\r\nDuke John, we are told, absolutely refused to give any one his\r\nconfidence as to what he was going to do at any period of the campaign.\r\nHe used to say that if his shirt knew his plans he would burn it; and\r\nso, with a great deal of manœuvring and mystery, he captured a small\r\nplace in Britanny called La Guerche, made a vain attempt to reduce\r\nanother fortress, and then returned to England.[51-1] It may have been\r\nowing to public discontent at the small result of his great\r\npreparations, that he was accused of treason on his return; when, unable\r\nto endure so great a reproach, he was believed to have put an end to his\r\nown life.[51-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 51-1: Basin, _Histoire de Charles VII._ etc. i. 150-1.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 51-2: _Hist. Croylandensis Continuatio_ in Fulman’s\r\n    _Scriptores_, p. 519.]\r\n\r\nWith a full recollection of the indiscretions of his brother John, the\r\nKing’s Council must have hesitated to confide to Duke Edmund such an\r\nimportant trust as the government of Normandy. They must have hesitated\r\nall the more, as the appointment of Somerset involved the recall of the\r\nDuke of York. And we are told that their acts at the time betrayed\r\nsymptoms of such irresolution; insomuch that one day a new governor of\r\nNormandy was proclaimed at Rouen, and the next his commission was\r\nrevoked and another named in his stead.[51-3] But at last the influence\r\nof Somerset prevailed. He was not, however, permitted to go abroad\r\nwithout warning of the dangers against which he had to provide. The\r\nveteran Sir John Fastolf drew up a paper for his guidance, pointing out\r\nthat it was now peculiarly important to strengthen the fortifications on\r\nthe new frontier, to protect the seaports, to preserve free\r\ncommunication with England, and (what was quite as politic a suggestion\r\nas any) to appoint a wise chancellor and a council for the impartial\r\nadministration of justice, so as to protect the inhabitants from\r\noppression.[52-1] From the comment made upon these suggestions, either\r\nby Fastolf himself or by his secretary William Worcester, it would seem\r\nthat they were not acted upon; and to this cause he attributed the\r\ndisasters which soon followed in quick succession, and brought upon the\r\nDuke of Somerset the indignation and contempt of a large number of his\r\ncountrymen. These feelings, probably, were not altogether just. The duke\r\nhad done good service before in France, and part of the blame of what\r\noccurred may perhaps be attributed to divided management--more\r\nespecially to the unruly feelings of a number of the English soldiers.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 51-3: Basin, i. 192.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 52-1: Stevenson’s _Wars_, ii. [592].]\r\n\r\nThe garrison which had been compelled against its will to give up Le\r\nMans found it hard to obtain quarters in Normandy. It was doubtful\r\nwhether they were not labouring under their own king’s displeasure, and\r\nthe captains of fortified towns were afraid to take them in. At last\r\nthey took possession of Pontorson and St. James de Beuvron, two towns\r\nsituated near the confines of Britanny which had been laid waste during\r\nthe previous wars and had since been abandoned. They began to victual\r\nand fortify themselves in these positions, to the alarm of their\r\nneighbours, until the Duke of Britanny felt it necessary to complain to\r\nthe Duke of Somerset, requesting that they might be dislodged. Somerset,\r\nin reply, promised to caution them not to do anything in violation of\r\nthe truce, but declined to bid them evacuate their positions. Diplomatic\r\nintercourse went on between one side and the other, always in the most\r\ncourteous terms, but every day it was becoming more apparent that all\r\nconfidence was gone.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1449.] At last, in March 1449, the English justified the\r\nsuspicions that had long been entertained of them. A detachment of about\r\n600 men, under François de Surienne, popularly named L’Arragonois,\r\na leader in the pay of England,[53-1] who had, not long before, been\r\nknighted by Henry, crossed the frontier southwards into Britanny,\r\n[Sidenote: Capture of Fougères.] took by assault the town and castle of\r\nFougères, and made dreadful havoc and slaughter among the unsuspecting\r\ninhabitants. The place was full of wealthy merchants, for it was the\r\ncentre of a considerable woollen manufacture, and the booty found in it\r\nwas estimated at no less than two millions of gold.[53-2] Such a prize\r\nin legitimate warfare would undoubtedly have been well worth the taking;\r\nbut under the actual circumstances the deed was a glaring, perfidious\r\nviolation of the truce. Somerset had been only a few days before\r\nprotesting to the King of France that, even if all his towns were open\r\nand undefended, they would be perfectly secure from any assault by the\r\nEnglish;[53-3] yet here was a town belonging to the Duke of Britanny,\r\na vassal of the King of France who had been expressly included in the\r\ntruce, assaulted and taken by fraud. Somerset disavowed the deed, but\r\nrefused to make restitution. He professed to write to the king for\r\ninstructions how to act; but he utterly destroyed his flimsy pretence of\r\nneutrality by writing to the King of France, desiring him not to give\r\nassistance to the Duke of Britanny.[53-4]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 53-1: Stevenson’s _Wars_, i. 473; ii. 573.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 53-2: Stevenson’s _Reductio Normanniæ_, 406.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 53-3: _Ibid._ 402.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 53-4: _Ibid._ 406.]\r\n\r\nThe truth is that the expedition had been fully authorised, not only by\r\nSomerset in Normandy, but by the king and the Duke of Suffolk in\r\nEngland. It was suggested to L’Arragonois when he was in England by\r\nSuffolk himself, who assured him that he would do the king a most\r\nexcellent service by taking a place of so much consequence. He was\r\nfurther given to understand that he incurred no danger or\r\nresponsibility; for even if he were besieged by the Duke of Britanny,\r\nample succours would be despatched to relieve him. Unfortunately, during\r\nthe next few months, the English had too much to do to keep their word,\r\nand L’Arragonois was compelled to surrender the place again to the Duke\r\nof Britanny after a five weeks’ siege. Feeling himself then absolved\r\nfrom every engagement to England, he next year sent back the Order of\r\nthe Garter to Henry, declaring himself from that time a subject of his\r\nnatural lord the King of Arragon, in whose country he proposed to spend\r\nthe remainder of his days.[54-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 54-1: Stevenson’s _Wars_, i. 275, 278, etc.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the richness of the booty won by the capture of\r\nFougères, the English ought to have been aware that they would have a\r\nheavy price to pay for it. The alienation of a friend in the Duke of\r\nBritanny evidently did not grieve them, although that in itself should\r\nhave been a matter of some concern; for the duke, though nearly related\r\nto the French king, had studied to keep himself neutral hitherto. To his\r\nand his father’s pacific policy it was owing that the commerce of\r\nBritanny had prospered and Fougères itself become rich, while\r\nneighbouring districts were exposed to the ravages of war. But the\r\nresentment of the Duke of Britanny was not a cause of much apprehension.\r\nThe effect of the outrage upon the French people was a much more serious\r\nmatter, and this was felt immediately. The King of France, when he heard\r\nthe news, was at Montils by Tours on the point of starting for Bourges.\r\nHe immediately changed his purpose and turned back to Chinon that he\r\nmight be nearer Britanny. A secret treaty was made between the king and\r\nthe duke to aid each other on the recommencement of hostilities with the\r\nEnglish. [Sidenote: Pont-de-l’Arche taken by the French.] A plot was\r\nalso laid to surprise the town of Pont-de-l’Arche on the Seine, just as\r\nFougères had been surprised by the English. It was completely\r\nsuccessful, and Pont-de-l’Arche was captured by stratagem early in the\r\nmorning of the 16th of May, by a body of adventurers professedly in the\r\nservice of Brittany. There could be no mistake about the significance of\r\nthe retribution. To the Duke of Britanny the capture of Pont-de-l’Arche\r\nwas of no value, except in the way of retaliation, for it was at a great\r\ndistance from his borders; while to France it was a most important gain\r\nif used with a view to the recovery of Normandy. But France was quite as\r\nfree to disavow the deed as the English Government had been to disavow\r\nthe taking of Fougères.\r\n\r\nCharles had, in fact, gained, in a strategic point of view, quite as\r\ngreat an advantage as the English had gained in point of material\r\nwealth. But morally his advantage was greater still, for he showed\r\nhimself perfectly open to treat for the redress of outrages on both\r\nsides, and was willing to put Pont-de-l’Arche again into the hands of\r\nthe English if they would have restored Fougères. All conferences,\r\nhowever, were ineffectual, and the French followed up their advantage by\r\ntaking Gerberoy and Conches. In the south they also won from the English\r\ntwo places in the neighbourhood of Bordeaux.[55-1] Still, Charles had\r\nnot yet declared war, and these things were avowedly no more than the\r\nacts of desultory marauders. His ambassadors still demanded the\r\nrestitution of Fougères, which possibly the English might now have been\r\nwilling to accord if they could have had the French captures restored to\r\nthem, but that in the surrender of the place they would have had to\r\nacknowledge Britanny as a feudal dependency of Charles.[55-2]\r\nNegotiations were accordingly broken off, and Charles having besides\r\nreceived particulars of a breach of the truce with Scotland in the\r\npreceding year, which even an English writer does not venture to\r\ndefend,[55-3] at length made a formal declaration of hostilities.[55-4]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 55-1: _Reductio Normanniæ_, 251.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 55-2: _Ibid._ 503.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 55-3: ‘Eodem anno [26 Hen.

Giles), Hen. VI. p. 36.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 55-4: _Reductio Normanniæ_, 254.]\r\n\r\nNever, it must be owned, did England incur the grave responsibilities of\r\nwar with a greater degree of foolhardiness. Somerset himself seemed only\r\nnow to have wakened up to the defenceless state of Normandy. He had just\r\nsent over Lord Hastings and the Abbot of Gloucester with a message to\r\nthe English Parliament desiring immediate aid. The French, he said, were\r\ndaily reinforcing their garrisons upon the frontier, and committing\r\noutrages against the truce. General musters were proclaimed throughout\r\nthe kingdom, and every thirty men of the whole population were required\r\nto find a horseman fully equipped for war. Meanwhile, the English\r\ngarrisons in Normandy were too feeble to resist attack. Not a single\r\nplace was furnished with sufficient artillery, and the fortifications,\r\nalmost everywhere, had fallen into such decay that even if filled with\r\nmen and guns they could not possibly be defended. Besides this, the\r\nwhole province was in such extreme poverty that it could no longer\r\nendure further imposts for the charges of its own defence.[56-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 56-1: _Rolls of Parl._ v. 147.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Progress of the French.] No marvel, therefore, that the\r\nprogress of the French arms was, from this time, uninterrupted. On the\r\n19th July the town of Verneuil was taken by the aid of a miller who had\r\nbeen maltreated by some of the garrison; and, some time afterwards, the\r\ncastle also surrendered. In August operations were carried on in several\r\nparts of the Duchy at once. Towns near the sea and towns near the French\r\nfrontier were attacked at the same time; and Pont-Audemer, Lisieux,\r\nMantes, Vernon, and other places were recovered from the English. Then\r\nfollowed in quick succession the capture of Essay, Fécamp, Harcourt,\r\nChambrois, Roche-Guyon, and Coutances. In October, Rouen, the capital of\r\nthe province, was invested. On the 19th the inhabitants with one accord\r\nrose in arms against the English, who found it necessary to retreat into\r\nthe castle. In this stronghold Somerset himself was assailed by the King\r\nof France, and, after a vain attempt to secure better terms, agreed to\r\nsurrender not only it but the fortresses of Arques, Caudebec, and\r\nseveral other places, leaving the gallant Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, as\r\na hostage until they were delivered up. Meanwhile, the Duke of Britanny\r\noverran Lower Normandy and recovered his own Fougères after a siege of\r\nlittle more than a month. François L’Arragonois, finding no hope of\r\nsuccours, surrendered the place and afterwards went over to the French.\r\n\r\nIn short, before the end of the year, the English had lost nearly\r\neverything in the North of France. The inhabitants everywhere conspired\r\nto betray towns and garrisons, and every man not English-born took part\r\nagainst the English. Even King René, Henry’s father-in-law, assisted\r\nCharles at the siege of Rouen, and shared the honours of his triumphal\r\nentry. At the end of the year 1449 the English held nothing in Normandy\r\nexcept a few towns upon the sea-coast or a little way inland--the chief\r\nof these being Honfleur, Bayeux, Caen, and Cherbourg. The last-named\r\nfortress remained untaken till the 12th of August in the following year.\r\nWhen it surrendered, the whole of Normandy was finally lost.\r\n\r\nThe news of these reverses so rapidly following each other of course\r\nproduced in England the most profound dissatisfaction. The Parliament to\r\nwhich Somerset had applied for aid had been removed after Whitsunday to\r\nWinchester on account of the insalubrity of the air in London and\r\nWestminster, and had been finally dissolved on the 16th of July. A new\r\nParliament was then called for a winter session to provide for the\r\ndefence of Normandy, when, in fact, it was too late.[57-1] By the time\r\nit had assembled Rouen was already lost. [Sidenote: Unpopularity of\r\nSuffolk.] The secret odium with which the policy of Suffolk had been\r\nviewed for years past could now no longer be restrained. It was\r\ndifficult to persuade the many that the disgrace which had befallen the\r\nEnglish arms was not due to treachery as much as to incompetence. The\r\ncession of Maine and Anjou was more loudly blamed than ever, and Suffolk\r\nwas considered to have negotiated the king’s marriage mainly with a view\r\nto his own advantage. It was remembered how he had once imprudently\r\nboasted that he possessed no less weight in the counsels of the King of\r\nFrance than in those of his own sovereign; it was again murmured that he\r\nhad been the cause of Gloucester’s death. And notwithstanding the\r\nprotection of the Court, these feelings found expression in Parliament.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 57-1: _Rolls of Parl._ v. 143, 171. Even when the new\r\n    Parliament met at Westminster on the 6th November it was obliged\r\n    to adjourn to the City of London on account of the unhealthiness\r\n    of the air. We must remember that Westminster was then little\r\n    better than a flat muddy island, with a vast extent of marshy land\r\n    and stagnant pools between Pimlico and the Thames.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1450.] At the beginning of the New Year, an incident\r\noccurred which served still further to precipitate his ruin. [Sidenote:\r\nMurder of the Bishop of Chichester.] Adam de Moleyns, Bishop of\r\nChichester, keeper of the Privy Seal, who, as we have seen, had been\r\nsent over to France in the beginning of 1448, to arrange the peaceful\r\ncession of Le Mans, was at this time sent to Portsmouth to pay the wages\r\nof certain soldiers and sailors. He was a scholar as well as a\r\nstatesman, and corresponded occasionally with the celebrated Æneas\r\nSylvius, afterwards Pope Pius II.[58-1] But, like Suffolk, he was\r\nbelieved to make his own advantage out of public affairs. He had the\r\nreputation of being very covetous; the king’s treasury was ill supplied\r\nwith money, and he endeavoured to force the men to be satisfied with\r\nless than their due. On this they broke out into open mutiny, cried out\r\nthat he was one of those who had sold Normandy, and thereupon put him to\r\ndeath.[58-2] This was on the 9th day of January 1450. During the\r\naltercation he let fall some words, probably in justification of his own\r\nconduct, which were considered to reflect most seriously upon that of\r\nthe Duke of Suffolk,[58-3] and a cry arose for the duke’s impeachment in\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 58-1: _Æneæ Sylvii Epp._ 80, 186.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 58-2: According to his friend, Æneas Sylvius, the mode\r\n    of death inflicted on him was decapitation. (_Opera_, 443.)]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 58-3: _Rolls of Parl._ v. 176.]\r\n\r\nIt must certainly be acknowledged by any candid student of history that\r\nthe state of the English Constitution in early times did not admit of\r\ntrue and impartial justice being done to an accused minister. So long as\r\na man in Suffolk’s position was upheld by the power of the Crown, it was\r\nto the last degree dangerous to say anything against him; but when the\r\nvoice of complaint could no longer be restrained, the protection he had\r\nbefore received ceased to be of any use to him. It became then quite as\r\ndangerous to say anything in his favour as it had been formerly to\r\naccuse him. The Crown could not make common cause with one whose conduct\r\nwas under suspicion; for the king could do no wrong, and the minister\r\nmust be the scapegoat. The party, therefore, which would insist on any\r\ninquiry into the conduct of a minister, knew well that they must succeed\r\nin getting him condemned, or be branded as traitors themselves. Such\r\nproceedings accordingly began inevitably with intrigue. Lord Cromwell\r\nwas Suffolk’s enemy at the council-table, and used his influence\r\nsecretly with members of the House of Commons, to get them to bring\r\nforward an impeachment in that chamber. That he was a dangerous opponent\r\nSuffolk himself was very well aware. A little before Christmas, William\r\nTailboys, one of the duke’s principal supporters, had set a number of\r\narmed men in wait for him at the door of the Star Chamber, where the\r\ncouncil met, and Lord Cromwell narrowly escaped being killed. The\r\nattempt, however, failed, and Tailboys was committed to the Tower; from\r\nwhich it would seem that he must soon afterwards have been released.\r\nCromwell then brought an action against him in the Court of Exchequer to\r\nrecover damages for the assault, and was awarded £3000; on which\r\nTailboys was committed to the Sheriff of London’s prison; and this was\r\nall the redress obtained by Cromwell till, by a special Act in the\r\nensuing Parliament, Tailboys was removed from that place of confinement,\r\nand lodged in the Tower once more, for a period of twelve months. Owing\r\nto the king’s protection he was not brought to trial.[59-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 59-1: W. Worc. _Rolls of Parl._ v. 200. I find by an\r\n    entry in the _Controlment Roll_, 30 Hen. VI., that on St.\r\n    Bartholomew’s Day, 1451, William Tailboys and nineteen other\r\n    persons belonging to South Kyme, in Lincolnshire, were outlawed at\r\n    the suit of Elizabeth, widow of John Saunderson, for the murder of\r\n    her husband.]\r\n\r\nAn evil day, nevertheless, had arrived for the Duke of Suffolk, which\r\nnot all the influence of the king, nor the still greater influence of\r\nMargaret of Anjou, who owed to him her proud position as Henry’s\r\nconsort, was able to avert. On the 22nd of January the duke presented a\r\npetition to the king that he might be allowed to clear himself before\r\nParliament of the imputations which had been cast on him in consequence\r\nof the dying words of Bishop Moleyns. He begged the king to remember how\r\nhis father had died in the service of King Henry V. at Harfleur--how his\r\nelder brother had been with that king at Agincourt--how two other\r\nbrothers had fallen in the king’s own days at Jargeau, when he himself\r\nwas taken prisoner and had to pay £20,000 for his ransom--how his fourth\r\nbrother had been a hostage for him in the enemies’ hands and died there.\r\nHe also reminded the king that he had borne arms for four-and-thirty\r\nyears, had been thirty years a Knight of the Garter, and had served in\r\nthe wars abroad for seventeen years at a time, without ever coming home.\r\nSince then he had been fifteen years in England about the king’s person,\r\nand he prayed God that if ever he died otherwise than in his bed, it\r\nmight be in maintaining the quarrel that he had been at all times true\r\nto Henry.[60-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 60-1: _Rolls of Parl._ v. 176.]\r\n\r\nFour days after this a deputation from the Commons waited on the Lord\r\nChancellor, desiring that as Suffolk had confessed the prevalence of\r\ninjurious reports against him, he might be committed to custody. This\r\nrequest was laid by the Chancellor before the king and council on the\r\nfollowing day, and the opinion of the judges being taken as to the\r\nlegality of the proposed arrest, he was allowed to remain at liberty\r\nuntil a definite charge should be brought against him. Such a charge was\r\naccordingly declared two days later by the Speaker, who did not hesitate\r\nto tell the Lord Chancellor, in the name of the Commons, that Suffolk\r\nwas believed to be in league with the French king to promote an invasion\r\nof England, and had fortified the castle of Wallingford with a view of\r\nassisting the invaders. The duke, on this, was committed to the Tower.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Suffolk impeached.] On the 7th of February he was formally\r\nimpeached by the Commons. A copy of the articles of impeachment will be\r\nfound in the Paston Letters (No. 76). Nothing was said in them of the\r\nfortification of Wallingford Castle, but a number of specific charges\r\nwere made, many of them authenticated by the exact day and place when\r\nthe alleged treasonable acts were committed, tending to show that in his\r\ncommunications with the French he had been invariably opposed to the\r\ninterests of his own country. It was alleged that he had been bribed to\r\ndeliver Anjou and Maine, and that as long ago as the year 1440 he was\r\ninfluenced by corrupt motives to promote the liberation of the Duke of\r\nOrleans; that he had disclosed the secrets of the English\r\ncouncil-chamber to the French king’s ambassadors; that he had even given\r\ninformation by which France had profited in the war, and that he had\r\nrendered peace negotiations nugatory by letting the French know\r\nbeforehand the instructions given to the English envoys. Further, in the\r\nmidst of invasion and national disgrace, he had hoped to gratify his own\r\nambition. The king, who was still childless, was to be deposed; and the\r\nduke had actually hoped to make his own son king in his place. It seems\r\nthat he had obtained some time before a grant of the wardship of\r\nMargaret Beaufort, daughter of the late Duke of Somerset, who was the\r\nnearest heir to the Crown in the Lancastrian line, and since his arrest\r\nhe had caused her to be married to his own son, Lord John De la\r\nPole.[61-1] Such was the foundation on which the worst charge rested.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 61-1: So it is stated in the impeachment. According to\r\n    the inquisition on Suffolk’s death, his son was born on the 27th\r\n    September 1442, and was therefore at this time only in his eighth\r\n    year.--Napier’s _Historical Notices of Swyncombe and Ewelme_,\r\n    108.]\r\n\r\nA month passed before he was heard in his own defence. The Commons\r\nimpeached, but it was for the Lords to try him. Meanwhile, another bill\r\nof indictment had been prepared by the malice of his enemies, in which\r\nall the failures of his policy were visited upon him as crimes, and\r\nattributed to the worst and most selfish motives. For his own private\r\ngain, he had caused the Crown to be prodigal of grants to other persons,\r\ntill it was so impoverished that the wages of the household were unpaid,\r\nand the royal manors left to fall into decay. He had granted the earldom\r\nof Kendal, with large possessions both in England and in Guienne, to a\r\nGascon, who ultimately sided with the French, but had happened to marry\r\nhis niece. He had weakened the king’s power in Guienne, alienated the\r\nCount of Armagnac, and caused a band of English to attack the king’s\r\nGerman allies; he had disposed of offices to unworthy persons without\r\nconsulting the council, granted important possessions in Normandy to the\r\nFrench king’s councillors, given to the French queen £13,000 of the\r\nrevenues of England, appropriated and misapplied the king’s treasure and\r\nthe subsidies granted by Parliament for the keeping of the sea. These\r\nand some minor charges formed the contents of the second bill of\r\nindictment.[61-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 61-2: _Rolls of Parl._ v. 179-182.]\r\n\r\nHe was brought from the Tower on the 9th day of March, and required to\r\nmake answer before the Lords to the contents of both bills. He requested\r\nof the king that he might have copies, which were allowed him; and that\r\nhe might prepare his answer more at ease, he was removed for a few days\r\nto a tower within the king’s palace at Westminster. [Sidenote: His\r\ndefence.] On the 13th he was sent for to make his answer before the king\r\nand lords. Kneeling before the throne, he replied to each of the eight\r\narticles in the first bill separately. He denied their truth entirely,\r\nand offered to prove them false in whatever manner the king would\r\ndirect. He declared it absurd to consider Margaret Beaufort as\r\nheir-presumptive to the Crown, and used other arguments to show the\r\nimprobability of his designs on the succession. In all else he showed\r\nthat the other lords of the council were quite as much committed as he;\r\nand as to the delivery of Anjou and Maine, he laid the responsibility\r\nentirely upon the murdered Bishop of Chichester.[62-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 62-1: _Rolls of Parl._ v. 182.]\r\n\r\nNext day, the Chief Justice, by the king’s command, asked the Lords what\r\nadvice they would give the king in the matter. It was a Saturday, and\r\nthe Lords deferred their answer till the following Monday; but on the\r\nMonday nothing was done. On the Tuesday the king sent for all the Lords\r\nthen in London to attend him in his own palace, where they met in an\r\ninner chamber. When they were assembled, Suffolk was sent for, and\r\nkneeling down, was addressed briefly by the Lord Chancellor. He was\r\nreminded that he had made answer to the first bill of the Commons\r\nwithout claiming the right of being tried by the peers; and he was asked\r\nif he had anything further to say upon the subject. He replied that the\r\naccusations were too horrible to be further spoken of, and he hoped he\r\nhad sufficiently answered all that touched the king’s person, and the\r\nstate of his kingdom. Nevertheless, he submitted himself entirely to the\r\nking, to do with him whatever he thought good.[62-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 62-2: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\nOn this an answer was returned to him in the king’s name by the Lord\r\nChancellor. A miserably weak and evasive answer it was, showing clearly\r\nthat the king desired to protect his favourite, but had not the\r\nmanliness to avow he thought him worthy of protection. The Lord\r\nChancellor was commissioned to say, that as to the very serious charges\r\ncontained in the first bill, the king regarded Suffolk as not having\r\nbeen proved either guilty or innocent; but touching those contained in\r\nthe second bill, which amounted only to misprisions, as Suffolk did not\r\nput himself upon his peerage, but submitted entirely to the king, the\r\nlatter had determined, without consulting the Lords, and not in the way\r\nof judgment (for he was not sitting in tribunal), but merely in virtue\r\nof the duke’s own submission, [Sidenote: He is ordered to leave\r\nEngland.] to bid him absent himself from England for five years, from\r\nthe first day of May ensuing.[63-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 63-1: _Rolls of Parl._ v. 183.]\r\n\r\nIt is clear upon the face of the matter, that although the king was made\r\nto take the sole responsibility of this decision, it was really a thing\r\narranged, and not arranged without difficulty, between the friends of\r\nSuffolk and some of the leading members of the House of Lords.\r\nImmediately after it was pronounced, Viscount Beaumont, who was one of\r\nSuffolk’s principal allies, made a protest on behalf of the Lords, that\r\nwhat the king had just done, he had done by his own authority, without\r\ntheir advice and counsel. He accordingly besought the king that their\r\nprotest might be recorded in the rolls of Parliament, for their\r\nprotection, so that the case might not henceforth be made a precedent in\r\nderogation of the privileges of the peerage.[63-2] Thus it was clearly\r\nhoped on all sides a great crisis had been averted. Suffolk was got rid\r\nof, but not condemned. A victim was given over to popular resentment,\r\nbut the rights of the Peers for the future were to be maintained. And\r\nthough the Crown lowered itself by an avowed dereliction of duty, it was\r\nnot severely censured for preferring expediency to justice.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 63-2: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\nOn the following night the duke left Westminster for Suffolk. The people\r\nof London were intensely excited, and about two thousand persons sallied\r\nout to St. Giles’ hoping to intercept his departure, but they succeeded\r\nonly in capturing his horse and some of his servants, whom they\r\nmaltreated, as might have been expected. Even after this the excitement\r\nwas scarcely diminished. Seditious manifestoes were thrown about in\r\npublic and secretly posted on church doors.[64-1] The duke had more than\r\na month to prepare for leaving England, and seems to have spent the time\r\nin the county of Suffolk. [Sidenote: He embarks for Flanders.] On\r\nThursday the 30th of April he embarked at Ipswich for Flanders; but\r\nbefore going he assembled the gentlemen of the county, and, taking the\r\nsacrament, swore he was innocent of the sale of Normandy and of the\r\nother treasons imputed to him.[64-2] He also wrote an interesting letter\r\nof general admonitions for the use of his young son, at that time not\r\neight years old, whom he was not to see again for at least five years,\r\nand too probably not at all. This letter, which is known to us only by a\r\ncopy preserved in the Paston correspondence (No. 117), can hardly fail\r\nto awaken sympathy with the writer. As an evidence of unaffected piety\r\nto God and sincere loyalty to his king, it will probably outweigh with\r\nmost readers all the aspersions cast by Parliament on the purity of his\r\nintentions.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 64-1: Rymer, xi. 268.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 64-2: W. Worc. 468, 469.]\r\n\r\nTwo ships and a little pinnace conveyed him from the Suffolk coast\r\nsouthwards till he stood off Dover, when he despatched the small vessel\r\nwith letters to certain persons in Calais to ascertain how he should be\r\nreceived if he landed there. The pinnace was intercepted by some ships\r\nwhich seem to have been lying in wait for his passage; and when it was\r\nascertained where the duke actually was, they immediately bore down upon\r\nhim. Foremost among the pursuers was a ship called the _Nicholas of the\r\nTower_, the master of which, on nearing Suffolk’s vessel, sent out a\r\nboat to ask who they were. Suffolk made answer in person, and said that\r\nhe was going by the king’s command to Calais; on which they told him he\r\nmust speak with their master. They accordingly conveyed him and two or\r\nthree others in their boat to the _Nicholas_. When he came on board the\r\nmaster saluted him with the words, ‘Welcome, traitor!’ and sent to know\r\nif the shipmen meant to take part with the duke, which they at once\r\ndisowned all intention of doing. The duke was then informed that he must\r\ndie, but was allowed the whole of the next day and night to confess\r\nhimself and prepare for the event.[64-3] On Monday the 2nd of May the\r\nrovers consummated their design. In sight of all his men Suffolk was\r\ndrawn out of the _Nicholas_ into a boat in which an axe and block were\r\nprepared. [Sidenote: Is murdered at sea.] One of the crew, an Irish\r\nchurl, then bade him lay down his head, telling him in cruel mockery\r\nthat he should be fairly dealt with and die upon a sword. A rusty sword\r\nwas brought out accordingly, and with nearly half a dozen strokes the\r\nfellow clumsily cut off his head. He was then stripped of his russet\r\ngown and velvet doublet. His body was brought to land and thrown upon\r\nthe sands at Dover; and his men were at the same time allowed to\r\ndisembark.[65-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 64-3: _English Chronicle_, ed. Davies, p. 69.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 65-1: _Paston Letters_, Nos. 120, 121.]\r\n\r\nThe source from which we learn most of these particulars is a letter of\r\nWilliam Lomner to John Paston written when the news was fresh. The\r\nwriter seems to have been quite overpowered by the tragic character of\r\nthe event, and declares he had so blurred the writing with tears that he\r\nfears it would not be easy to decipher. Indications of genuine human\r\nfeeling like this are so rare in letters of an early date that we are in\r\ndanger of attributing to the men of those days a coldness and brutality\r\nwhich were by no means so universal as we are apt to suppose. The truth\r\nis that when men related facts they regarded their own feelings as an\r\nimpertinence having nothing whatever to do with the matter in\r\nhand.[65-2] The art of letter-writing, besides, had not yet acquired the\r\nfreedom of later days. It was used, in the main, for business purposes\r\nonly. We shall meet, it is true, in this very correspondence, with one\r\nor two early specimens of jesting epistles; but, on the whole, I suspect\r\npaper was too valuable a commodity and writing too great a labour to be\r\nwasted on things irrelevant.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 65-2: Even the passage above referred to would probably\r\n    be an illustration of this if the original letter were examined.\r\n    As we have reprinted it from Fenn, it stands thus: ‘Right\r\n    worshipful Sir, I recommend me to you, and am right sorry of that\r\n    I shall say, _and have so wesshe this little bill with sorrowful\r\n    tears that uneathes ye shall read it_.’ The words in italics would\r\n    probably be found to be an interlineation in the original, for\r\n    though they stand at the beginning of the letter, they were\r\n    clearly written after it was penned, and the only reason why they\r\n    were inserted was to excuse the illegibility of the writing.]\r\n\r\nBut whatever feeling may have been excited by the news of Suffolk’s\r\nmurder in men like William Lomner, who possibly may have known the duke\r\npersonally, we may well believe that the nation at large was neither\r\nafflicted nor very greatly shocked at the event. Even the prior of\r\nCroyland, the head of a great religious community in Lincolnshire,\r\nspeaks of it as the just punishment of a traitor, and has not a word to\r\nsay in reprobation.[66-1] Mocking dirges were composed and spread\r\nabroad, in which his partisans were represented as chanting his funeral\r\nservice, and a blessing was invoked on the heads of his murderers. These\r\nwere but the last of a host of satires in which the public indignation\r\nhad for months past found a vent.[66-2] Suffolk had been represented on\r\nhis imprisonment as a fox driven into his hole, who must on no account\r\nbe let out again. He had been rhymed at as the Ape with his Clog who had\r\ntied Talbot our good dog, in allusion to the fact of Talbot, Earl of\r\nShrewsbury, having been given up as a hostage to the French after the\r\nsurrender of Rouen.[66-3] He had been reviled as an upstart who had\r\nusurped the place of better men, and who systematically thwarted and\r\nneutralised all that better men could do. If any one wept for the fall\r\nof such a man, it was not on public grounds.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 66-1: _Contin. of Croyland Chronicle_, p. 525.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 66-2: Wright’s _Political Poems_ (in Rolls series), ii.\r\n    232.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 66-3: _Ibid._ 222, 224.]\r\n\r\nAs a specimen of these political satires we cannot resist the temptation\r\nto quote a short poem which must have been composed towards the close of\r\nthe year 1449, after the surrender of Rouen and before Suffolk’s fall.\r\nIt is far less personal than the others, being not so much an invective\r\nagainst Suffolk as a wail over the loss of England’s great men, and the\r\ndecay of her fortunes. The leading statesmen and warriors of that and\r\nthe former age are here spoken of by their badges, which the reader will\r\nfind interpreted in the margin:--\r\n\r\n  ‘The Root[a] is dead, the Swan[b] is gone,\r\n    The fiery Cresset[c] hath lost his light.\r\n  Therefore England may make great moan\r\n    Were not the help of God Almight’.\r\n  The Castle[d] is won where care begun,\r\n    The Portè-cullis[e] is laid adown;\r\n  Yclosèd we have our Velvet Hat[f]\r\n    That covered us from many stormes brown.\r\n  The White Lion[g] is laid to sleep,\r\n    Thorough the envy of th’ Apè[h] Clog;\r\n  And he is bounden that our door should keep;\r\n    That is Talbot, our good dog.\r\n  The Fisher[i] has lost his angle hook;\r\n    Get them again when it will be.\r\n  Our Millè-sail[k] will not about,\r\n    It hath so long gone empty.\r\n  The Bear[l] is bound that was so wild,\r\n    For he hath lost his Ragged Staff.\r\n  The Carte-nathe[m] is spoke-less\r\n    For the counsel that he gaf.\r\n  The Lily[n] is both fair and green;\r\n    The Conduit[o] runneth not, I wean.\r\n  The Cornish Chough[p] oft with his train\r\n    Hath made our Eagle[q] blind.\r\n  The White Hart[r] is put out of mind\r\n    Because he will not to them consent;\r\n  Therefore, the Commons saith, is both true and kind,\r\n    Both in Sussex and in Kent.\r\n  The Water Bouge[s] and the Wine Botell\r\n    With the Fetterlock’s[t] chain bene fast.\r\n  The Wheat Ear[u] will them sustain\r\n    As long as he may endure and last.\r\n  The Boar[w] is far into the West,\r\n    That should us help with shield and spear.\r\n  The Falcon[x] fleeth and hath no rest\r\n    Till he wit where to bigg his nest.’\r\n\r\n    [Footnote a: The Regent Bedford.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote b: Humphrey, Duke of Glo’ster.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote c: The last Duke of Exeter.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote d: Rouen Castle.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote e: The Duke of Somerset.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote f: The Cardinal Beaufort.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote g: The Duke of Norfolk, who had gone on pilgrimage to\r\n    Rome in 1447.

Kiriel.] A force under Sir Thomas Kiriel had\r\nbeen sent to the aid of the Duke of Somerset in Normandy after the loss\r\nof Rouen. It disembarked at Cherbourg, and proceeding towards Caen,\r\nwhere the duke had now taken up his position, besieged and took\r\nValognes. They were now in full communication with the garrisons of Caen\r\nand Bayeux, when they were suddenly attacked at the village of\r\nFourmigni, and routed with great slaughter. Between three and four\r\nthousand Englishmen were left dead upon the field; Kiriel himself was\r\ntaken prisoner; even the brave Matthew Gough (well known to Frenchmen of\r\nthat day as Matago) found it needful to fall back with his company of\r\n1500 men for the safeguard of Bayeux, which a month afterwards he was\r\ncompelled after all to give up to the enemy.[68-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 68-1: Berry’s narrative in Stevenson’s _Expulsion of the\r\n    English from Normandy_, 336. _Wars of the Engl._ ii. [360].\r\n    _Paston Letters_, No. 120.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Parliament, which had been prorogued over Easter, was\r\nordered to meet again at Leicester instead of Westminster. The reason\r\ngiven for the change of place was still, as before, the unhealthiness of\r\nthe air about Westminster; and doubtless it was a very true reason. It\r\nis possible, however, that the political atmosphere of London was quite\r\nas oppressive to the Court as the physical atmosphere could be to the\r\nParliament. During their sitting at Leicester a much needed subsidy was\r\nvoted to the king, and an Act passed for the application of certain\r\nrevenues to the expenses of the Royal Household in order to stop the\r\nexactions of purveyors. But they had hardly sat a month when the session\r\nwas suddenly put an end to from a cause which we proceed to notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rebellion of Jack Cade_\r\n\r\nThe murder of the Duke of Suffolk had not made things better than they\r\nhad been before. The ablest of the ministers, who had hitherto guided\r\nthe king’s counsels, was now removed, but his place was left for a time\r\naltogether unsupplied. The men of Suffolk’s party, such as Lord Say,\r\nViscount Beaumont, and Thomas Daniel, still remained about the king, and\r\nwere nearly as unpopular as he had been. The offices formerly held by\r\nSuffolk were divided among them and their particular friends.[68-2] Even\r\nif the Court had desired to call in men of greater weight, they were not\r\nthen at hand. The Duke of Somerset was in France, and the Duke of York\r\nin Ireland; so that some time must have elapsed before either of them\r\ncould have taken part in public affairs at home. Meanwhile it was said\r\nthat the resentment of the Court for Suffolk’s murder would be visited\r\nupon the county of Kent; and the county of Kent was of opinion that it\r\nsuffered abuses enough already. The exactions of the king’s officers,\r\nboth in the way of taxation and purveyance, were felt to be extortionate\r\nand capricious. The collectors of the revenue were appointed by the\r\nknights of the shire, and these, instead of being freely chosen by the\r\npeople, were but the nominees of a few great men who compelled their\r\ntenants to vote according to their pleasure. There were, besides, grave\r\ncases of injustice in which people were accused of treason, and kept in\r\nprison without trial, on the information of persons about the Court who\r\nhad influence to obtain grants of their lands from the Crown.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 68-2: _See_ No. 123. William Worcester says Lord\r\n    Beauchamp was made treasurer, and Lord Cromwell the king’s\r\n    chamberlain. Lord Beauchamp’s appointment is on the _Patent\r\n    Rolls_. See _Calendarium Rot. Patent_, p. 294.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cade’s Rebellion.] Hence arose Jack Cade’s rebellion,\r\na movement which we must not permit ourselves to look upon as a vulgar\r\noutbreak of the rabble. Whole districts of Kent, Surrey, and Sussex rose\r\nin arms, clamouring for redress of grievances; and it is certain that\r\nthe insurgents met with a large amount of sympathy, even from those who\r\ndid not actually take part with them.[69-1] As their leader, they\r\nselected a man who called himself Mortimer, and who, besides some\r\nexperience in war, was evidently possessed of no small talent for\r\ngeneralship. It afterwards turned out that his real name was Cade, that\r\nhe was a native of Ireland, and that he had been living a year before in\r\nthe household of Sir Thomas Dacre in Sussex, when he was obliged to\r\nabjure the kingdom for killing a woman who was with child. He then\r\nbetook himself to France and served in the French war against England.\r\nWhat induced him to return does not appear, unless we may suppose, which\r\nis not unlikely, that some misdemeanour when in the service of France\r\nmade the French soil fully as dangerous to him as the English. In\r\nEngland he seems to have assumed the name of Aylmer, and passed himself\r\noff as a physician. He married a squire’s daughter, and dressed in\r\nscarlet; and when the rebellion broke out in Kent he called himself John\r\nMortimer, a cousin of the Duke of York.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 69-1: The late Mr. Durrant Cooper, in an interesting\r\n    paper read before a meeting of the Kent Archæological Society,\r\n    examined the long list of names given on the _Patent Roll_ of 28\r\n    Henry VI., and proved from them that the insurrection was by no\r\n    means of a very plebeian or disorderly character. ‘In several\r\n    hundreds,’ he says, ‘the constables duly, and as if legally,\r\n    summoned the men; and many parishes, particularly Marden,\r\n    Penshurst, Hawkhurst, Northfleet, Boughton-Malherbe, Smarden, and\r\n    Pluckley, furnished as many men as could be found in our day fit\r\n    for arms.’]\r\n\r\nThe first disturbances took place at Whitsuntide in the latter end of\r\nMay. In the second week of June[70-1] a considerable army from the\r\ncounties of Kent, Surrey, and Sussex encamped upon Blackheath. The king,\r\nwho, on receiving news of the rising, had dissolved the parliament then\r\nsitting at Leicester, arrived in London on Saturday the 13th, and took\r\nup his quarters at the priory of St. John’s, near Smithfield. He had\r\nwith him 20,000 men under arms, but for some reason or other did not set\r\nout against the rebels till the following Thursday, the 18th.[70-1]\r\nThey, meanwhile, had withdrawn in the night-time,[70-2] and the king and\r\nhis host occupied their position on Blackheath. The royal forces,\r\nhowever, proceeded no further. Only a detachment, under Sir Humphrey\r\nStafford and his brother William, was sent to pursue the insurgents. An\r\nencounter took place at Sevenoaks on the 18th,[70-3] in which both the\r\nStaffords were killed. Their defeat spread dismay and disaffection in\r\nthe royal camp. The noblemen who had accompanied the king to Blackheath\r\ncould no longer keep their men together, the latter protesting that\r\nunless justice were done on certain traitors who had misled the king,\r\nthey would go over to the Captain of Kent. To satisfy them, Lord Say was\r\narrested and sent to the Tower; but even with this concession the king\r\ndid not dare presume upon their loyalty. He withdrew to Greenwich, and\r\nthe whole of his army dispersed. The king himself returned to London by\r\nwater, and made preparations during the next two or three days to remove\r\nto Kenilworth. The mayor and commons of the city went to him to beseech\r\nhim to remain, offering to live and die with him, and pay half a year’s\r\ncost of his household. But all was to no purpose. The king had not even\r\nthe manliness of Richard II. at Smithfield, and he took his departure to\r\nKenilworth.[71-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 70-1: These dates were given differently in previous\r\n    issues of this Introduction. For a rectification of the chronology\r\n    of the rebellion I am indebted to Kriehn’s _English Rising_ in\r\n    1450, pp. 125 and following.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 70-2: According to No. 119 of our collection this\r\n    retreat would appear to have been on the 22nd June, but that date\r\n    is certainly an error.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 70-3: The 18th June is given as the date of Sir Humphrey\r\n    Stafford’s death in _Inquis. post mortem_, 28 Henry VI. No. 7.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 71-1: W. Worc.--_Three Fifteenth Century Chronicles_\r\n    (edited by me for the Camden Soc.), 67.--Chronicle in MS. Cott.\r\n    Vitell. A. xvi.]\r\n\r\nThe city, thus deserted by its sovereign, knew not for a time what to\r\ndo. A party within the Common Council itself ventured to open\r\nnegotiations with the insurgents, and Alderman Cooke passed to and fro\r\nunder the safe-conduct of the Captain.[71-2] To many it may have seemed\r\ndoubtful loyalty to support the government of Lord Say and his friends\r\nagainst an oppressed population. On the 1st day of July[71-3] the\r\ninsurgents entered Southwark. On the 2nd a Common Council was called by\r\nthe Lord Mayor to provide means for resisting their entry into the city;\r\nbut the majority voted for their free admission, and Alderman Robert\r\nHorne, who was the leading speaker against them, was committed to prison\r\nfor his boldness. [Sidenote: The rebels enter London.] That same\r\nafternoon the so-called Mortimer and his followers passed over London\r\nBridge into the city. The Captain, after passing the drawbridge, hewed\r\nthe ropes asunder with his sword. His first proceedings were marked by\r\norder and discipline. He issued proclamations in the king’s name against\r\nrobbery and forced requisitions, but he rode through the different\r\nstreets as if to place the capital under military government; and when\r\nhe came to London Stone, he struck it with his sword, saying, ‘Now is\r\nMortimer lord of this city.’ Finally, he gave instructions to the Lord\r\nMayor about the order to be kept within his jurisdiction, and returned\r\nfor the night to his quarters in Southwark. On the following morning,\r\nFriday the 3rd, he again entered the city, when he caused Lord Say to be\r\nsent for from the Tower. That no resistance was made to this demand by\r\nLord Scales, who had the keeping of the fortress, may seem strange. But\r\nthere was a reason for it which most of the chroniclers do not tell us.\r\nThe king had been obliged to listen to the grievances of his ‘Commons’\r\nand to withdraw his protection from his favourites. He had granted a\r\ncommission ‘to certain lords and to the mayor and divers justices, to\r\ninquire of all persons that were traitors, extortioners, or oppressors\r\nof the king’s people.’[72-1] Lord Say was accordingly formally arraigned\r\nat a regular sessions at the Guildhall. But when the unfortunate\r\nnobleman claimed the constitutional privilege of being tried by his\r\npeers, the pretence of law was finally laid aside. A company of the\r\ninsurgents took him from the officers and hurried him off to the\r\nStandard in Cheap, where, before he was half shriven, his head was cut\r\noff and stuck upon a long pole. A son-in-law of his named Crowmer, who\r\nwas then very unpopular as sheriff of Kent, met with a similar fate. He\r\nwas beheaded in Cade’s presence at Mile End. Barbarity now followed\r\nviolence. The lifeless heads of Say and Crowmer were carried through the\r\nstreets, and made to kiss each other. At the same time one Bailey was\r\nbeheaded at Whitechapel on a charge of necromancy, the real cause of his\r\ndeath being, as it was reported, that he was an old acquaintance of\r\nCade’s who might have revealed something of his past history.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 71-2: Holinshed, iii. 632.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 71-3: I leave this part of the story as it was\r\n    originally written, though here, too, the chronology seems to\r\n    require rectification, especially from sources since published,\r\n    for which the reader may consult Kriehn’s work, p. 129.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 72-1: MS. Vitellius A. xvi. fol. 107, quoted by Kriehn,\r\n    p. 92.]\r\n\r\nIt may have been the expectation of inevitable exposure that induced\r\nCade now to relax discipline, and set an example of spoliation himself.\r\nHe entered and pillaged the house of Philip Malpas, an alderman known as\r\na friend of the Court, and therefore unpopular in the city. Next day he\r\ndined at a house in the parish of St. Margaret Pattens, and then robbed\r\nhis host. At each of these acts of robbery the rabble were sharers of\r\nthe spoil. But, of course, such proceedings completely alienated all who\r\nhad anything to lose, and the mayor and aldermen began to devise\r\nmeasures for expelling Cade and his followers from the city. For this\r\nend they negotiated with Lord Scales and Matthew Gough, who had then the\r\nkeeping of the Tower.\r\n\r\nFor three days successively Cade had entered the city with his men, and\r\nretired in the evening to Southwark. But on Sunday, the 5th of July, he\r\nfor some reason remained in Southwark all day. In the evening the mayor\r\nand citizens, with a force under Matthew Gough, came and occupied London\r\nBridge to prevent the Kentish men again entering the city. [Sidenote:\r\nBattle on London Bridge.] The Captain called his men to arms, and\r\nattacked the citizens with such impetuosity, that he drove them back\r\nfrom the Southwark end of the bridge to the drawbridge in the centre.\r\nThis the insurgents set on fire, after inflicting great losses on the\r\ncitizens, many of whom were slain or drowned in defending it. Matthew\r\nGough himself was among those who perished. Still, the fight was\r\nobstinately contested, the advantage being for the moment now with one\r\nparty and now with the other. It continued all through the night till\r\nnine on the following morning; when at last the Kentish men began to\r\ngive way, and a truce was made for a certain number of hours.\r\n\r\n  [[Sidenote: Battle on London Bridge.\r\n  _final . missing_]]\r\n\r\nA favourable opportunity now presented itself for mediation. Although\r\nthe king had retired to Kenilworth, he had left behind him in London\r\nsome leading members of his council, among whom were Cardinal Kemp,\r\nArchbishop of York,[73-1] then Lord Chancellor, and Waynflete, Bishop of\r\nWinchester. The former had taken refuge in the Tower, under the\r\nprotection of Lord Scales; and he called to him the latter, who lay\r\nconcealed at Holywell.[73-2] A conference was arranged between them and\r\nthe insurgents, and both the Cardinal and Bishop Waynflete[73-3] with\r\nsome others crossed the river and met with Cade in St. Margaret’s Church\r\nin Southwark. In the end matters were satisfactorily arranged, and the\r\nbishop produced two general pardons prepared by the Chancellor, the\r\nfirst for the Captain himself, and the second for his followers. The\r\noffer was embraced with eagerness. The men were by this time disgusted\r\nwith their leader, and alarmed at the result of their own acts. By\r\nthousands they accepted the amnesty and began to return homewards. But\r\nCade, who knew that his pardon would avail him little when the history\r\nof his past life came to be investigated, wisely made friends to himself\r\nafter the fashion of the Unjust Steward. He broke open the gaols of the\r\nKing’s Bench and Marshalsea, and formed a new company out of the\r\nliberated prisoners.[74-1] He then despatched to Rochester a barge laden\r\nwith the goods he had taken from Malpas and others in London, and\r\nprepared to go thither himself by land. He and his new following appear\r\nto have been still in Southwark on the 8th of July, but to have passed\r\nthrough Dartford to Rochester on the 9th, where they continued still in\r\narms against the king on the 10th and 11th.[74-2] An attempt they made\r\nupon the castle of Queenborough was resisted by Sir Roger Chamberlain,\r\nto whom a reward was given in the following year in acknowledgment of\r\nhis services.[74-3] Meanwhile a proclamation was issued offering a\r\nreward of a thousand marks for Cade’s apprehension, and ten marks for\r\nthat of any of his followers; ‘for,’ says a contemporary chronicler, ‘it\r\nwas openly known that his name was not Mortimer; his name was John Cade;\r\nand therefore his charter stood in no strength.’[74-4]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 73-1: Inaccurately called Archbishop of Canterbury by\r\n    Fabyan and others. He was not translated to Canterbury till 1452.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 73-2: Hall’s _Chronicle_. Holy Well was a mineral spring\r\n    to the north of London, much frequented before the Reformation,\r\n    when it was stopped up as being considered a place of\r\n    superstitious resort. A century afterwards it was discovered anew\r\n    by a Mr. Sadler, from whom the locality is named to this day\r\n    Sadler’s Wells.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 73-3: Some doubt seems to be thrown on Hall’s statement\r\n    that both prelates crossed the river, as earlier writers say the\r\n    Chancellor _sent_ pardons under the Great Seal. William Worcester,\r\n    moreover, makes no mention of the cardinal, but says that the\r\n    Bishop of Winchester and others of the king’s council spoke with\r\n    the Captain of Kent. But the ‘Short English Chronicle’ in the\r\n    _Three Fifteenth Century Chronicles_, edited by me for the Camden\r\n    Society in 1880 (p. 68), does exactly the reverse, and omitting\r\n    all reference to the Bishop of Winchester, says: ‘And forthewithe\r\n    went the Chaunseler to the Capteyne and sessed him and gave him a\r\n    chartur and his men an other.’]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 74-1: Hall’s _Chronicle_.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 74-2: See _Act of Attainder_, 29 Hen. VI. _Rolls of\r\n    Parl._ vi. 224.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 74-3: Devon’s _Issue Rolls_, 471. Davies’ _English\r\n    Chron._ 67.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 74-4: _Three Fifteenth Century Chronicles_, 68.]\r\n\r\nThe feeble remains of the rebellion were already quarrelling about the\r\nbooty Cade had conveyed out of London. Their leader now took horse and\r\nescaped in disguise towards the woody country about Lewes. He was\r\npursued by Alexander Iden, a gentleman who had just been appointed\r\nsheriff of Kent in place of the murdered Crowmer. [Sidenote: Capture and\r\ndeath of Cade.] Iden overtook him in a garden at Heathfield, and made\r\nhim prisoner, not without a scuffle, in which Cade was mortally wounded,\r\nso that on being conveyed to London he died on the way. It only remained\r\nto use his carcass as a terror to evil-doers. His head was cut off and\r\nplaced upon London Bridge, with the face looking towards Kent. His body\r\nwas drawn through the streets of London, then quartered, and the\r\nquarters sent to four different places very widely apart,--one of them\r\nto Blackheath, one to Norwich, one to Salisbury, and one to\r\nGloucester.[75-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 75-1: W. Worc. Fabyan. Davies’ _English Chronicle_\r\n    (Camden Soc.), 67. Ellis’ _Letters_, 2nd Series i. 115.]\r\n\r\nIf the dispersion of traitors’ limbs for exhibition in many places could\r\nhave effectually repressed disloyalty, the whole realm ought now to have\r\nbeen at rest. The quarters of another Kentish rebel, who, under the name\r\nof Bluebeard, had raised disturbances in the preceding February, were at\r\nthat moment undergoing public exhibition in London, Norwich, and the\r\nCinque Ports. Those of two others were about this time despatched by the\r\nsheriffs of London to Chichester, Rochester, Portsmouth, Colchester,\r\nStamford, Coventry, Newbury, and Winchester. The heads of all these\r\nwretches were set upon London Bridge, which in the course of this\r\nmiserable year bore no less than twenty-three such horrid\r\nornaments.[75-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 75-2: Ellis, _ib._ MS. Vitell. A. xvi.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Further disturbances.] But with all this, sedition was not\r\nput down, even in the county of Kent; for I find by the evidence of\r\nauthentic records that a new rising took place in August at Feversham,\r\nunder one William Parminter, who, undeterred by the fate of Cade,\r\ngathered about him 400 men, and called himself _the second_ Captain of\r\nKent. This affair is quite unnoticed by historians, and all I know of it\r\nis derived from a pardon to one of those engaged in it.[75-3] But even\r\nParminter was not the last ‘Captain of Kent’ that made his appearance\r\nthis year; for the very same title was immediately afterwards assumed by\r\none John Smyth, for whose capture a reward of £40 was ordered to be paid\r\nto the Duke of Somerset on the 3rd of October.[75-4] And the\r\nchroniclers, though they do not mention these disturbances, tell us that\r\nsuch things were general over all the kingdom. In Wiltshire, at the time\r\nthat Cade was at Blackheath, William Ayscough, Bishop of Salisbury, had\r\none day said mass at Edington, when he was dragged from the altar by a\r\nband of his own tenants and murdered in his alb and stole at the top of\r\na neighbouring hill. He was the second bishop who had been murdered that\r\nyear by the populace. Another insurrection in the same county in August\r\nis mentioned in a letter of James Gresham’s, the number of the\r\ninsurgents being reported at nine or ten thousand men.[76-1] These\r\ninstances may suffice as evidence of the widespread troubles of the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 75-3: _See_ document in Appendix to this Introduction;\r\n    also Devon’s _Issue Rolls_, p. 472. It would seem as if the entry\r\n    there dated 5th August ought to have been 5th September, as\r\n    Parminter does not seem to have been taken even on the last day of\r\n    August.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 75-4: Nicolas’s _Proceedings of the Privy Council_, vi.\r\n    101.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 76-1: _See_ No. 131.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sir John Fastolf.] Of the degree of private suffering and\r\nmisery inflicted in particular cases by these commotions we have a\r\nlively picture in Letter 126. At the time when Cade and his followers\r\nwere encamped upon Blackheath, Sir John Fastolf, a noted warrior of the\r\ntime, of whom we shall have much to say hereafter, was residing at his\r\nhouse in Southwark. He was a man who had not succeeded in standing well\r\nwith his contemporaries, and the fact may have contributed not a little\r\nto the sensitiveness of a naturally irascible character. In one\r\nengagement with the French[76-2] he was actually accused of cowardice,\r\na charge which he seems afterwards satisfactorily to have disproved. For\r\nsome years, however, he had given up soldiering and returned to his\r\nnative country, where he served the king in a different manner as a\r\nmember of his Privy Council. But in this capacity too he was unpopular.\r\nHis advice should have been valuable at least in reference to the\r\naffairs of France; but it does not seem to have been taken. The warnings\r\nand counsels which he gave with reference to the maintenance of the\r\nEnglish conquests in France he caused his secretary, William Worcester,\r\nto put in writing for his justification; but though his admonitions were\r\nneglected by those to whom they were addressed, popular rumour held him\r\npartly accountable for the loss of Normandy. Of this opinion some\r\nevidence was given in the course of Cade’s insurrection.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 76-2: The Battle of Patay.]\r\n\r\nAs a member of the King’s Council Fastolf thought it right to send a\r\nmessenger to ascertain what were the demands of the insurgents.\r\n[Sidenote: John Payn and the rebels.] He therefore commanded one John\r\nPayn, who was in his service, to take a man with him and two of the best\r\nhorses of his stable, and ride to Blackheath. When he arrived there,\r\nCade ordered him to be taken prisoner. To save his master’s horses from\r\nbeing stolen, Payn gave them to the attendant, who galloped away with\r\nthem as fast as he could, while he himself was brought before the\r\nCaptain. Cade then asked him what he had come for, and why he had caused\r\nhis fellow to run away with the horses. He answered that he had come to\r\njoin some brothers of his wife, and other companions who were among the\r\ninsurgents. On this some one called out to the Captain that he was a man\r\nof Sir John Fastolf’s, and that the two horses were Sir John’s. The\r\nCaptain raised a cry of ‘Treason!’ and sent him through the camp with a\r\nherald of the Duke of Exeter before him, in the duke’s coat-of-arms. At\r\nfour quarters of the field the herald proclaimed with an _Oyez_ that\r\nPayn had been sent as a spy upon them by the greatest traitor in England\r\nor France, namely, by one Sir John Fastolf, who had diminished all the\r\ngarrisons of Normandy, Le Mans, and Maine, and thereby caused the loss\r\nof all the king’s inheritance beyond sea. It was added that Sir John had\r\ngarrisoned his place with the old soldiers of Normandy, to oppose the\r\nCommons when they came to Southwark; and, as the emissary of such a\r\ntraitor, Payn was informed that he should lose his head.\r\n\r\nHe was brought to the Captain’s tent, where an axe and block were\r\nproduced. But fortunately he had friends among the host; and Robert\r\nPoynings, Cade’s swordbearer and carver, who afterwards married John\r\nPaston’s sister Elizabeth, declared plainly that there should die a\r\nhundred or two others if Payn were put to death. He was therefore\r\nallowed to live on taking an oath that he would go to Southwark and arm\r\nhimself, and return to join the Commons. He accordingly carried to\r\nFastolf a statement of their demands, advising him at the same time to\r\nput away his old soldiers and withdraw himself into the Tower. The old\r\nwarrior felt that the advice was prudent; he left but two of his\r\nservants in the place, and but for Payn the insurgents would have burned\r\nit to the ground. The faithful dependant, however, had to pay the full\r\npenalty of his master’s unpopularity. He seems to have entertained the\r\nrioters for some time at his own cost. Afterwards the Captain took from\r\nhim some valuable clothes and armour, and sent men to ransack his\r\nchamber of bonds, money, and other stores. The insurgents also robbed\r\nhis house in Kent, and threatened to hang his wife and children.\r\nFinally, on the night of the battle on London Bridge, Cade thrust him\r\ninto the thickest of the combat, where he continued six hours unable to\r\nextricate himself, and was dangerously wounded.\r\n\r\nTo have passed through all this was surely a severe enough trial; yet\r\nafter that commotion he had further trouble to endure. He was impeached\r\nby the Bishop of Rochester, and thrown into the Marshalsea by command of\r\nthe queen. He was also threatened to be hanged, drawn, and quartered, in\r\norder that he might accuse his master Fastolf of treason; but in the end\r\nhis friends succeeded in procuring for him a charter of pardon. To earn\r\nthis, however, as we find from the document itself, he had to appear\r\nbefore the king in person, during a progress which he made in Kent the\r\nyear after the rebellion, and, amid a crowd of other supplicants whose\r\nbodies were stripped naked down to their legs, humbly to beg for\r\nmercy.[78-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 78-1: _See_ Appendix to Introduction.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Dukes of York and Somerset_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Duke of York.] Cade’s rebellion was attributed by the\r\nCourt to the machinations of the Duke of York. The disturbances that had\r\nprevailed for some months previously seem to have been partly associated\r\nwith his name. When Adam de Moleyns, Bishop of Chichester, was murdered\r\nin the beginning of the year, the malcontents talked of inviting York\r\nover from Ireland to redress the wrongs of the people. The exclusion of\r\nYork and other lords of royal blood from the king’s councils was also\r\nmade an express ground of complaint by the Kentish insurgents. The\r\nrepetition of his name in the mouths of the disaffected was anything but\r\ngrateful to the party then in power. It was construed as being in itself\r\nan evidence of his disloyalty. But the popular complaints as to his\r\ntreatment were both just and reasonable, for it was a matter that\r\nconcerned the public weal. The rank, wealth, and lineage of the Duke of\r\nYork, his connection with the blood-royal, his large possessions, and\r\nfinally his well-proved ability both as a general and an\r\nadministrator--all marked him out as one who ought to have been invited\r\nto take a leading part in the government of the realm; but a faction\r\nabout the king had taken care to keep him as much as possible at a\r\ndistance from the Court. Moreover, it had maligned and aspersed him in\r\nhis absence, so that it would have been positively insecure for himself\r\nto allow the charges to accumulate. A time had clearly come when it was\r\nno longer his duty to obey the orders of others. His enemies were\r\nbecoming more and more unpopular every day, and the only hope of\r\nimproving the administration of affairs depended upon his taking the\r\ninitiative.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Comes over from Ireland.] He accordingly determined to avail\r\nhimself of the privilege due to his rank, and lay his requests at the\r\nfoot of the throne. A little before Michaelmas he came over from\r\nIreland, collected 4000 of his retainers upon the Welsh Marches, and\r\nwith them proceeded to London. His coming, although unsolicited by the\r\nking and without leave asked, was nevertheless not altogether\r\nunexpected. Attempts were made to stop his landing at Beaumaris, and\r\nbodies of men lay in wait for him in various places to interrupt his\r\nprogress. For this, however, he could not have been unprepared. He knew\r\nwell the hatred entertained towards him at the Court, for he had\r\nexperienced pretty much the same thing years before in going to Ireland,\r\nas now in coming from it. Although he was sent to that country in the\r\nking’s service, and as the king’s lieutenant, there were persons\r\ncommissioned to apprehend him at several points in his journey thither;\r\nand now on his return similar efforts were made to prevent his advance\r\nto London. As regards himself they were altogether fruitless; but it is\r\nnot improbable that they succeeded in deterring many of his followers\r\nfrom joining him. William Tresham, the Speaker of the last Parliament,\r\nhaving received a summons from the duke to meet him, was waylaid and\r\nmurdered in Northamptonshire by a body of the retainers of Lord Grey of\r\nRuthin. For two months the murderers went at large. The sheriff of the\r\ncounty durst not arrest them, and it was only on the meeting of\r\nParliament that a special act was passed for their punishment.[80-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 80-1: _Rolls of Parl._ v. 211-12.]\r\n\r\nYork, however, pursued his way, in spite of all opposition, to the royal\r\npresence, and great was the dismay of those then about the king.\r\nAccording to an act passed against him nine years later, his approach\r\nwas not unaccompanied by violence. He and his followers, it is said,\r\ncame in warlike array to Westminster Palace, and ‘beat down the spears\r\nand walls’ in the king’s chamber. If so, we should infer that his access\r\nto the king was opposed even at the last moment. But the opposition was\r\nineffectual, and the reception he met with from Henry himself did not\r\nindicate that the king at all resented his conduct.\r\n\r\nIt must have been on his first interview with Henry that he presented a\r\npetition and received a reply from him, which are printed in Holinshed\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Richard, Duke of York: his letter to King Henry_[80-2]\r\n\r\n  Please it your Highness to conceive that since my departing out of\r\n  this your realm by your commandment, and being in your service in\r\n  your land of Ireland, I have been informed that divers language hath\r\n  been said of me to your most excellent estate which should sound to\r\n  my dishonour and reproach and charge of my person; howbeit that I\r\n  have been, and ever will be, your true liegeman and servant, and if\r\n  there be any man that will or dare say the contrary or charge me\r\n  otherwise, I beseech your rightwiseness to call him before your high\r\n  presence, and I will declare me for my discharge as a true knight\r\n  ought to do. And if I do not, as I doubt not but I shall, I beseech\r\n  you to punish me as the poorest man of your land. And if he be found\r\n  untrue in his suggestion and information, I beseech you of your\r\n  highness that he be punished after his desert in example of all\r\n  other.\r\n\r\n  Please it your Excellency to know that as well before my departing\r\n  out of this your realm for to go into your land of Ireland in your\r\n  full noble service, as since, certain persons have lain in wait for\r\n  to hearken upon me, as Sir John Talbot, knight, at the castle of\r\n  Holt, Sir Thomas Stanley, knight, in Cheshire, Pulford at Chester,\r\n  Elton at Worcester, Brooke at Gloucester, and Richard, groom of your\r\n  chamber, at Beaumaris; which had in charge, as I am informed, to\r\n  take me, and put me into your castle of Conway, and to strike off\r\n  the head of Sir William Oldhall, knight, and to have put in prison\r\n  Sir William Devereux, knight, and Sir Edmund Malso (Mulso), knight,\r\n  withouten enlarging until the time that your Highness had appointed\r\n  their deliverance.\r\n\r\n  Item, at such time as I was purposed for to have arrived at your\r\n  haven of Beaumaris, for to have come to your noble presence to\r\n  declare me your true man and subject, as my duty is, my landing was\r\n  stopped and forebarred by Henry Norris, Thomas Norris, William\r\n  Buckley, William Grust, and Bartholomew Bould, your officers in\r\n  North Wales, that I should not land there, nor have victuals nor\r\n  refreshing for me and my fellowship, as I have written to your\r\n  Excellency here before; so far forth, that Henry Norris, deputy to\r\n  the chamberlain of North Wales, said unto me that he had in\r\n  commandment that I should in no wise have landing, refreshing, nor\r\n  lodging, for men nor horse, nor other thing that might turn to my\r\n  worship or ease; putting the blame upon Sir William Say, usher of\r\n  your chamber, saying and affirming that I am against your intent and\r\n  [held] as a traitor, as I am informed. And, moreover, certain\r\n  letters were made and delivered unto Chester, Shrewsbury, and to\r\n  other places, for to let mine entry into the same.\r\n\r\n  Item, above all wrongs and injuries above said, done unto me of\r\n  malice without any cause, I being in your land of Ireland in your\r\n  honourable service, certain commissions were made and directed unto\r\n  divers persons, which for the execution of the same sat in certain\r\n  places, and the juries impanelled and charged. Unto the which juries\r\n  certain persons laboured instantly to have me indicted of treason,\r\n  to the intent for to have undone me and mine issue, and corrupted my\r\n  blood, as it is openly published. Beseeching your Majesty royal of\r\n  your righteousness to do examine these matters, and thereupon to do\r\n  such justice in this behalf as the cause requireth; for mine intent\r\n  is fully to pursue to your Highness for the conclusion of these\r\n  matters.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 80-2: The whole of this correspondence is attributed by\r\n    Holinshed and Stow to the year 1452; but it appears to me clearly\r\n    to belong to the year 1450, when the Duke had just returned from\r\n    Ireland. See _Chronicle of London_, 136; though internal evidence\r\n    alone will, I think, satisfy the careful student.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Answer of King Henry to the Duke of York_\r\n\r\n  Cousin, we have seen the bill that ye took us late, and also\r\n  understand the good humble obedience that ye in yourself show unto\r\n  us, as well in word as in deed; wherefore our intent is the more\r\n  hastily to ease you of such things as were in your said bill.\r\n  Howbeit that at our more leisure we might answer you to your said\r\n  bill, yet we let you wit that, for the causes aforesaid, we will\r\n  declare you now our intent in these matters. Sith it is that a long\r\n  time among the people hath been upon you many strange language, and\r\n  in especial anon after your [qu. their?][82-1] disordinate and\r\n  unlawful slaying of the bishop of Chichester,[82-2] divers and many\r\n  of the untrue shipmen and other said, in their manner, words against\r\n  our estate, making menace to our own person by your sayings, that ye\r\n  should be fetched with many thousands, and ye should take upon you\r\n  that which ye neither ought, nor, as we doubt not, ye will not\r\n  attempt; so far forth that it was said to our person by divers, and\r\n  especially, we remember, of one Wasnes which had like words unto us.\r\n  And also there were divers of such false people that went on and had\r\n  like language in divers of our towns of our land, which by our\r\n  subjects were taken and duly executed. Wherefore we sent to divers\r\n  of our courts and places to hearken and to take heed if any such\r\n  manner coming were, and if there had been, for to resist it; but\r\n  coming into our land our true subject as ye did, our intent was not\r\n  that ye, nor less of estate of our subjects, nor none of your\r\n  servants should not have been letted nor warned, but in goodly wise\r\n  received; howbeit that peradventure your sudden coming, without\r\n  certain warning, caused our servants to do as they did, considering\r\n  the causes abovesaid. And as to the indictment that ye spoke of, we\r\n  think verily and hold for certain, that there was none such. And if\r\n  ye may truly prove that any person was thereabouts, the matter shall\r\n  be demeaned as the case shall require, so that he shall know it is\r\n  to our great displeasure. Upon this, for the easing of your heart in\r\n  all such matters, we declare, repute and admit you as our true and\r\n  faithful subject, and as our faithful cousin.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 82-1: I have no doubt this is a misreading of the\r\n    contracted form ‘y{r}’ which was intended for ‘their.’ To accuse\r\n    York of the murder of the Bishop of Chichester, and apparently as\r\n    a principal, not an accessory in that murder, when he was at the\r\n    time in Ireland, would have been absurd. Besides, the tenor of the\r\n    whole of this reply is to exculpate York of all charges.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 82-2: Misprinted ‘Chester’ in Holinshed.]\r\n\r\nSo far, York had gained his object. The charges against him were\r\nrepudiated by the highest authority in the kingdom. But it was\r\nimpossible that the matter could rest there. His own interests and those\r\nof the public alike compelled him to demand a full inquiry into the\r\nmachinations of his adversaries, and when admitted to freer intercourse\r\nwith Henry he was able to support this request by most inconvenient\r\narguments. Town and country now listened with eagerness for news of a\r\nlong looked-for crisis, while, as it seemed, the old _régime_ was being\r\nquietly laid aside at Westminster. [Sidenote: A change of government.]\r\n‘Sir, and it please,’ writes one newsmonger, William Wayte, the clerk of\r\nJustice Yelverton, ‘Sir, and it please, I was in my lord of York’s\r\nhouse, and I heard much thing more than my master writeth unto you of.\r\nI heard much thing in Fleet Street. But, sir, my lord was with the king,\r\nand he visaged so the matter that all the king’s household was and is\r\nafraid right sore. And my said lord hath put a bill to the king and\r\ndesired much thing which is much after the Commons’ desire; and all is\r\nupon justice, and to put all those that be indicted under arrest without\r\nsurety or mainprise, and to be tried by law as law will; insomuch that\r\non Monday Sir William Oldhall was with the king at Westminster more than\r\ntwo hours, and had of the king good cheer.’[83-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 83-1: _See_ No. 142.]\r\n\r\nSir William Oldhall, a friend and companion-in-arms of the Duke of York\r\nin France, had been summoned to the king’s councils more than once\r\nbefore.[83-2] But the last occasion was eleven years before this, at a\r\ntime when it was doubtless felt to be necessary to obtain the sanction\r\nbeforehand of all parties in the State to the proposed negotiations for\r\npeace at Calais. From that day till now we do not hear of him, and we\r\nmay presume that he was not invited to Court. By the Duke of York’s\r\nletter just quoted, it would seem that courtiers had planned to have him\r\nbeheaded. But now the old exclusiveness was defeated. Men whose\r\npatriotism and generalship, it was believed, would have averted the loss\r\nof France, were at length allowed free access to their sovereign; while\r\nmen who were believed to have culpably misdirected the king, and by\r\ntheir favouritism and partiality to have perverted the course of justice\r\nthroughout the kingdom, stood in fear of a strict inquiry being made\r\ninto their misdeeds. For such was the sole purport of the ‘bill,’ or\r\npetition presented by the Duke of York as mentioned by William Wayte,\r\nthe exact text of which will be seen in No. 143. The king’s answer to\r\nthis is preserved in Holinshed as follows:--\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 83-2: Nicolas’s _Proceedings of the Privy Council_, iv.\r\n    212, v. 108.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Answer of King Henry to the Duke of York_\r\n\r\n  Cousin, as touching your bill last put up to us, we understand well\r\n  that ye, of good heart, counsel and advertise us to the setting up\r\n  of justice and to the speedy punishing of some persons indicted or\r\n  noised, offering your service to be ready at commandment in the\r\n  same; sith it is, that for many causes moving us to have determined\r\n  in our soul to stablish a sad and substantial Council, giving them\r\n  more ample authority and power than ever we did before this, in the\r\n  which we have appointed you to be one. But sith it is not\r\n  accustomed, sure, nor expedient, to take a conclusion and conduct by\r\n  advice or counsel of one person by himself, for the conservation (?)\r\n  it is observed that the greatest and the best, the rich and the\r\n  poor, in liberty, virtue and effect of their[84-1] voices be equal;\r\n  we have therefore determined within ourself to send for our\r\n  Chancellor of England and for other Lords of our Council, yea and\r\n  all other, together within short time, ripely to common of these and\r\n  other our great matters. In the which communication such\r\n  conclusions, by the grace of God, shall be taken, as shall sound to\r\n  His pleasure, the weal of us and our land, as well in these matters\r\n  as in any other.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 84-1: Misprinted ‘your’ in Holinshed.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Politics in Norfolk.] The time was favourable to men like\r\nJohn Paston, who had been wronged by a powerful neighbour such as Lord\r\nMolynes, and had been hitherto denied redress. There seemed also a hope\r\nof destroying, once for all, the influence of Tuddenham and Heydon in\r\nthe county of Norfolk. It was proposed that on the Duke of York visiting\r\nNorfolk, which he intended to do, the mayor and aldermen of Norwich\r\nshould ride to meet him, and that complaints should be preferred against\r\nthe party of Tuddenham and Heydon in the name of the whole city. ‘And\r\nlet that be done,’ adds William Wayte, ‘in the most lamentable wise;\r\nfor, Sir, but if (_i.e._ unless) my Lord hear some foul tales of them,\r\nand some hideous noise and cry, by my faith they are else like to come\r\nto grace.’ Owing to the influence of the Duke of York, a new Parliament\r\nwas summoned to meet in November, and John Paston was urged by some\r\nfriends to get himself returned as a member. But it was still more\r\nstrongly recommended that the Earl of Oxford should meet the duke,\r\napparently with the view of arranging the list of candidates--a\r\nresponsibility which the earl, for his part, seems to have declined. The\r\nDuke of Norfolk met with the Duke of York at Bury St. Edmunds, and these\r\ntwo dukes settled that matter between them. The Earl of Oxford modestly\r\ncontented himself with reporting their decision, and advising that their\r\nwishes should be carried into effect.[85-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 85-1: Nos. 142, 145, 148, and 149. The influence of a\r\n    powerful nobleman on the elections was evidently quite a matter of\r\n    course. What use York made of it, or attempted to make of it,\r\n    cannot so easily be determined. Of the two candidates proposed by\r\n    him for the county of Norfolk, only one was returned, the name of\r\n    Sir Miles Stapleton being substituted for that of Sir William\r\n    Chamberlain (_see_ vol. ii. p. 185 note 1). It appears from two of\r\n    the above cited letters that Stapleton was a favourite candidate\r\n    with the Pastons and their friends, and that he was urged to wait\r\n    on the Duke of York on his coming to Norwich.]\r\n\r\nThe Parliament met on the 6th November, and Sir William Oldhall was\r\nchosen Speaker. About the same time a commission of _Oyer and Terminer_\r\nwhich had been issued as early as the first of August,[85-2] began its\r\nlabours at Norwich, and the Earl of Oxford stayed away from Parliament\r\nto attend it. Mr. Justice Yelverton was sent down from Westminster to\r\nsit on that tribunal along with him. There seemed hope at last of\r\nredress being had for the wrongs and violence that had prevailed in the\r\ncounty of Norfolk; but the course of justice was not yet an easy one.\r\nGreat pressure had been put upon the king, even at the last moment, that\r\nYelverton should be countermanded, and Lord Molynes had spoken of his\r\nown dispute with Paston in the king’s presence in a manner that made the\r\nfriends of the latter wish he had been then at Westminster to see after\r\nhis own interests. The Lords of the Council, however, determined that\r\nYelverton should keep his day for going into Norfolk. When he arrived\r\nthere, he had occasion to report that there were many persons\r\nill-disposed towards Tuddenham and Heydon, but that it was most\r\nimportant they should be encouraged by a good sheriff and under-sheriff\r\nbeing appointed, else there would be a total miscarriage of justice. For\r\nthe annual election of sheriffs had been delayed this year, apparently\r\nowing to the state of parties. Until the Duke of York arrived in London\r\nfor the Parliament, his friends would not allow them to be nominated;\r\nand the state of suspense and anxiety occasioned by this delay is\r\nclearly shown in the letters written during November.[86-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 85-2: _See_ No. 119.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 86-1: Nos. 151, 153, 154, 155, 156.]\r\n\r\nThe truth is, the Duke of York had not yet succeeded in establishing the\r\ngovernment upon anything like a firm or satisfactory basis. In times\r\nlike our own there is little difficulty in determining the\r\nresponsibility of ministers; but in the rough judgment of the ‘Commons’\r\nof those days an error in policy was nothing short of treason. Whoever\r\ntook upon him to guide the king’s counsels knew very well the danger of\r\nthe task; and York (if I understand his character aright) was anxious,\r\nuntil he was driven desperate, never to assume more authority than he\r\nwas distinctly warranted in doing. He could not but remember that his\r\nfather had suffered death for conspiring to depose Henry V., and that\r\nhis own high birth and descent from Edward III. caused his acts to be\r\nall the more jealously watched by those who sought to estrange him from\r\nhis sovereign. He therefore made it by no means his aim to establish for\r\nhimself a marked ascendency. He rather sought to show his moderation.\r\nI find, indeed, that at this particular period he not only removed two\r\nmembers of the Council, Lord Dudley and the Abbot of St. Peter’s at\r\nGloucester, but sent them prisoners to his own castle of Ludlow.[86-2]\r\nThis, however, he could hardly have done without permission from the\r\nking, as it was the express object of his petition above referred to,\r\nthat persons accused of misconducting themselves in high places should\r\nbe committed for trial; and judging from the terms of the king’s answer,\r\nI should say that it must have been done by the authority of the new\r\nCouncil, which Henry therein declared it to be his intention to\r\nconstitute.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 86-2: Stow’s _Chronicle_, p. 392.]\r\n\r\nThis new Council was probably what we should call in these days a\r\ncoalition ministry. [Sidenote: The Duke of Somerset.] York’s great\r\nrival, the Duke of Somerset, had come over from Normandy a little before\r\nYork himself came over from Ireland. On the 11th of September, while\r\nCardinal Kemp, who was then Lord Chancellor, was sitting at Rochester on\r\na commission of _Oyer and Terminer_ to try the Kentish rebels,[87-1] he\r\naffixed the Great Seal to a patent appointing Somerset Constable of\r\nEngland.[87-2] In that capacity, as we have already seen, the duke\r\narrested one of the new Kentish leaders that started up after Cade’s\r\nrebellion had been quelled. There is no doubt that he stood high in the\r\nking’s confidence, and that he was particularly acceptable to Queen\r\nMargaret. He was, nevertheless, one of the most unpopular men in\r\nEngland, on account of his surrender of Caen and total loss of Normandy\r\nin the preceding year; and as the Parliament was now called, among other\r\nreasons, expressly to provide for the defence of the kingdom, and for\r\nspeedy succours being sent to preserve the king’s other dominions in\r\nFrance,[87-3] it was impossible that his conduct should not be inquired\r\ninto. The short sitting of Parliament before Christmas was greatly\r\noccupied by controversy between York and Somerset.[87-4] On the 1st of\r\nDecember the latter was placed under arrest. His lodgings at the Black\r\nFriars were broken into and pillaged by the populace, and he himself was\r\nnearly killed, but was rescued from their violence by a barge of his\r\nbrother-in-law the Earl of Devon. Next day the Dukes of York and Norfolk\r\ncaused proclamation to be made through the city that no man should\r\ncommit robbery on pain of death, and a man was actually beheaded in\r\nCheap for disobeying this order. As a further demonstration against\r\nlawlessness, the king and his lords, on Thursday the 3rd December, rode\r\nthrough the city in armour, either side of the way being kept by a line\r\nof armed citizens throughout the route of the procession. It was the\r\nmost brilliant display of the kind the Londoners of that day had ever\r\nseen.[88-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 87-1: _See_ vol. ii. pp. 161-2.]  [[Letter 131]]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 87-2: Rymer, xi. 276.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 87-3: _Rolls of Parl._ v. 210.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 87-4: W. Worc.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 88-1: MS. Cott. Vitell. A. xvi. Stow in his _Chronicle_\r\n    dates this procession a day later.]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Somerset did not long remain in prison. Very soon after\r\nChristmas the king made him captain of Calais, and gave him the entire\r\ncontrol of the royal household.[88-2] The Court was evidently bent on\r\nthe restoration of the old order of things, so far as it dared to do so.\r\nThe chief obstacle to this undoubtedly was the Parliament, which was, on\r\nthe whole, so favourable to the Duke of York, that one member, Young of\r\nBristol, had even ventured to move that he should be declared heir to\r\nthe crown.[88-3] Parliament, however, could be prorogued; and, as Young\r\nfound shortly afterwards, its members could be committed to the Tower.\r\nThe speech of the Lord Chancellor on the meeting of Parliament had\r\ndeclared that it was summoned for three important causes: first, to\r\nprovide for the defence of the kingdom, and especially the safeguard of\r\nthe sea; secondly, for the speedy relief of the king’s subjects in the\r\nsouth of France, and aid against the French; thirdly, for pacifying the\r\nking’s subjects at home, and punishing the disturbances which had lately\r\nbeen so frequent. But practically nothing was done about any of these\r\nmatters before Christmas. An act was passed for the more speedy levying\r\nof a subsidy granted in the last Parliament, and also an act of\r\nattainder against the murderers of William Tresham. The Lord Chancellor\r\nthen, in the king’s name and in his presence, prorogued the Parliament\r\ntill the 20th of January, declaring that the matters touching the\r\ndefence of the kingdom were too great and difficult to be adequately\r\ndiscussed at that time. The same excuse, however, was again used for\r\nfurther prorogations until the 5th of May; and meanwhile fears began to\r\nbe entertained in the country that all that had been done hitherto for a\r\nmore impartial administration of justice was about to be upset.[88-4]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 88-2: W. Worc.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 88-3: _The Chronicle of London_ (p. 137) says that ‘all\r\n    the Commons’ agreed to this proposition, and stood out for some\r\n    time against the Lords on the subject.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 88-4: _Rolls of Parl._ v. 210-14.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1451.] During the whole course of the succeeding year\r\nmatters were in a very unsettled condition. At the very opening of the\r\nyear we hear complaints that the sheriff, Jermyn, had not shown himself\r\nimpartial, but was endeavouring to suppress complaints against certain\r\npersons at the coming sessions at Lynn. It was feared the king would\r\npardon Tuddenham and Heydon the payment of their dues to the Exchequer\r\nfor Suffolk; and if they did, payment of taxes would be generally\r\nrefused, as Blake, the Bishop of Swaffham, having gone up to London,\r\ninformed the Lord Chancellor himself. From London, too, men wrote in a\r\nmanner that was anything but encouraging. The government was getting\r\nparalysed alike by debt and by indecision. ‘As for tidings here,’ writes\r\nJohn Bocking, ‘I certify you all is nought, or will be nought. The king\r\nborroweth his expenses for Christmas. The King of Arragon, the Duke of\r\nMilan, the Duke of Austria, the Duke of Burgundy, would be assistant to\r\nus to make a conquest, and nothing is answered nor agreed in manner save\r\nabiding the great deliberation that at the last shall spill all\r\ntogether.’ Chief-Justice Fortescue had been for a week expecting every\r\nnight to be assaulted.[89-1] The only symptom of vigour at headquarters\r\nwas the despatch of a commission of _Oyer and Terminer_ into Kent, for\r\nthe trial of those who had raised disturbances during the preceding\r\nsummer. As for the county of Norfolk, the only hope lay in a strong\r\nclamour being raised against oppressors. Sir John Fastolf showed himself\r\nanxious about the prosecution of certain indictments against Heydon, and\r\nhis servant Bocking, and Wayte, the servant of Judge Yelverton, urged\r\nthat strong representations should be made to Lord Scales against\r\nshowing any favour to that unpopular lawyer.[89-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 89-1: In earlier issues of this Introduction was added:\r\n    ‘probably for no other reason than his high impartiality.’ Mr.\r\n    Plummer, I find, who knows him better, has not the same opinion of\r\n    Fortescue’s impartiality as a politician, but considers that he\r\n    was in danger just because he was so strong a Lancastrian. _See_\r\n    Introduction to _The Governance of England_, p. 50.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 89-2: Nos. 167, 169-174.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tuddenham and Heydon.] By and by it was seen what good reason\r\nthe friends of justice had for their apprehensions. It had been arranged\r\nthat Tuddenham and Heydon should be indicted at a sitting of the\r\ncommission of _Oyer and Terminer_ at Norwich in the ensuing spring.\r\nRumours, however, began to prevail in Norwich that they who had promoted\r\nthis commission in the county of Norfolk--the Earl of Oxford and Justice\r\nYelverton, as well as John Paston and John Damme--were to be indicted in\r\nKent by way of revenge. John Damme had before this caused Heydon to be\r\nindicted of treason for taking down one of those hideous memorials of a\r\nsavage justice--the quarter of a man exposed in public. The man was\r\ndoubtless a political victim belonging to Heydon’s own party; but Heydon\r\nwas now looking to recover his influence, and he contrived to get the\r\ncharge of treason retorted against Damme. Symptoms were observed in\r\nNorwich that the unpopular party were becoming bolder again. ‘Heydon’s\r\nmen,’ wrote James Gloys to John Paston, ‘brought his own horse and his\r\nsaddle through Aylesham on Monday, and they came in at the Bishop’s\r\nGates at Norwich, and came over Tombland and into the Abbey; and sithen\r\nthey said they should go to London for Heydon. Item, some say that\r\nHeydon should be made a knight, and much other language there is which\r\ncauseth men to be afeard, weening that he should have a rule\r\nagain.’[90-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 90-1: Nos. 179 and 180.]\r\n\r\nFull well might Sir John Fastolf and others apprehend that if Heydon or\r\nTuddenham appeared in answer to the indictment, it would be with such a\r\nfollowing at his back as would overawe the court. No appearance was put\r\nin for them at all at several of the sessions of _Oyer and Terminer_.\r\nOne sitting was held at Norwich on the 2nd of March. Another was held\r\njust after Easter on the 29th of April, and Justice Prisot, not the most\r\nimpartial of judges, was sent down to Norwich to hold it. Strong\r\ncomplaints were put in against Tuddenham and Heydon on the part of the\r\ncity of Norwich, and also by the town of Swaffham, by Sir John Fastolf,\r\nSir Harry Inglos, John Paston, and many others; but, as Fastolf’s\r\nchaplain afterwards informed his master, ‘the judges, by their\r\nwilfulness, might not find in their heart to give not so much as a beck\r\nnor a twinkling of their eye toward, but took it to derision, God reform\r\nsuch partiality!’ The one-sidedness of Prisot, indeed, was such as to\r\nbring down upon him a rebuke from his colleague Yelverton. ‘Ah, Sir\r\nMayor and your brethren,’ said the former, ‘as to the process of your\r\ncomplaints we will put them in continuance, but in all other we will\r\nproceed.’ Yelverton felt bound to protest against such unfairness.\r\n[Sidenote: Partial justice.] Yet even this was not the worst; for\r\nPrisot, seeing that, with all he could do, the result of the proceedings\r\nat Norwich would scarcely be satisfactory to Tuddenham and Heydon, took\r\nit upon him, apparently by his own authority, to remove them to\r\nWalsingham, where they had most supporters. And there, accordingly,\r\nanother session was opened on Tuesday the 4th of May.[91-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 91-1: Nos. 119, 185, 186, 192.]\r\n\r\nIt was, according to Sir Thomas Howys, ‘the most partial place of all\r\nthe shire.’ All the friends and allies of Tuddenham and Heydon, knights\r\nand squires, and gentlemen who had always been devoted to their\r\npleasure, received due warning to attend. A body of 400 horse also\r\naccompanied the accused, and not one of the numerous complainants\r\nventured to open his mouth except John Paston. Even he had received a\r\nfriendly message only two days before that he had better consider well\r\nwhether it was advisable to come himself, as there was ‘great press of\r\npeople and few friends’; and, moreover, the sheriff was ‘not so whole’\r\nas he had been. What this expression meant required but little\r\nexplanation. As Sheriff of Norfolk, John Jermyn was willing to do Paston\r\nall the service in his power, but simple justice he did not dare to\r\ndo.[91-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 91-2: Nos. 189, 192.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John Paston and Lord Molynes.] He had but too good an excuse\r\nfor his timidity. Of John Paston’s complaint against Tuddenham and\r\nHeydon we hear no more; we can easily imagine what became of it. But we\r\nknow precisely what became of an action brought by Paston at this\r\nsessions against his old adversary Lord Molynes, for his forcible\r\nexpulsion from Gresham in the preceding year. John Paston, to be sure,\r\nwas now peaceably reinstated in the possession of that manor;[91-3] but\r\nhe had the boldness to conceive that undermining his wife’s chamber,\r\nturning her forcibly out of doors, and then pillaging the whole mansion,\r\nwere acts for which he might fairly expect redress against both Lord\r\nMolynes and his agents. He had accordingly procured two indictments to\r\nbe framed, the first against his lordship, and the second against his\r\nmen. But before the case came on at Walsingham, Sheriff Jermyn gave\r\nnotice to Paston’s friends that he had received a distinct injunction\r\nfrom the king to make up a panel to acquit Lord Molynes.[92-1] Royal\r\nletters of such a tenor do not seem to have been at all incompatible\r\nwith the usages of Henry VI.’s reign. John Paston himself said the\r\ndocument was one that could be procured for six-and-eightpence.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 91-3: No. 178.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 92-1: No. 189.]\r\n\r\nThere was no hope, therefore, of making Lord Molynes himself responsible\r\nfor the attack on Gresham. The only question was whether the men who had\r\ndone his bidding could not be made to suffer for it. After the acquittal\r\nof their master, John Osbern reports a remarkable conversation that he\r\nhad with Sheriff Jermyn in which he did his best to induce him to accept\r\na bribe in Paston’s interest. The gift had been left with the under\r\nsheriff for his acceptance. Jermyn declined to take it until he had seen\r\nPaston himself, but Osbern was fully under the impression that he would\r\nbe glad to have it. Osbern, however, appealed also to other arguments.\r\n‘I remembered him,’ he tells Paston, ‘of his promises made before to you\r\nat London, when he took his oath and charge, and that ye were with him\r\nwhen he took his oath and other divers times; and for those promises\r\nmade by him to you at that time, and other times at the _Oyer and\r\nTerminer_ at Lynn, ye proposed you by the trust that ye have in him to\r\nattempt and rear actions that should be to the avail of him and of his\r\noffice.’ The prospect of Paston being valuable to him as a litigant had\r\nits weight with the sheriff, and he promised to do him all the good in\r\nhis power except in the action against Lord Molynes’ men; for not only\r\nLord Molynes himself but the Duke of Norfolk had written to him to show\r\nthem favour, and if they were not acquitted he expected to incur both\r\ntheir displeasure and the king’s. In vain did Osbern urge that Paston\r\nwould find sufficient surety to save the sheriff harmless. Jermyn said\r\nhe could take no surety over £100, and Lord Molynes was a great lord who\r\ncould do him more injury than that.[93-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 93-1: No. 193.]\r\n\r\n  [[The gift had been left with the under sheriff\r\n  _text unchanged: expected form “under-sheriff”_]]\r\n\r\nThe diplomacy on either side seems to have been conducted with\r\nconsiderable _finesse_. Jermyn declared that he had been offered twenty\r\nnobles at Walsingham in behalf of the Lord Molynes, but that he had\r\nnever received a penny either from him or from any of Paston’s\r\nadversaries. Osbern then offered if he would promise to be sincere\r\ntowards Paston, that the latter would give him a sum in hand, as much as\r\nhe could desire, or would place it in the hands of a middle man whom\r\nJermyn could trust. In the end, however, he was obliged to be satisfied\r\nwith Jermyn’s assuring him that if he found it lay within his power to\r\ndo anything for Paston, he would take his money with good will. The\r\nnegotiator’s impression was that he was fully pledged to get Lord\r\nMolynes’ men acquitted, but that in all other actions he would be found\r\nfavourable to Paston.[93-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 93-2: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Parliament.] About this time Parliament, which had now been\r\nprorogued for nearly five months, met again at Westminster. The king’s\r\nnecessities were doubtless the all-sufficient cause why its meeting\r\ncould no longer be dispensed with. The Crown was already in debt to the\r\nsum of £372,000, and was daily becoming more so. The expenses of the\r\nroyal household amounted to £24,000 a year, while the yearly revenue out\r\nof which they should have been paid was only £5000. Nor was it by any\r\nmeans advisable to remedy the matter by imposing fresh taxation; for the\r\npeople were so impoverished by the payment of subsidies, the exactions\r\nof the king’s purveyors, and the general maladministration of justice,\r\nthat the experiment could hardly have been made with safety. An act of\r\nresumption was the only expedient by which it seemed possible to meet\r\nthe difficulty; and all grants of crown lands made to any persons since\r\nthe first day of the reign were accordingly recalled by statute.[93-3]\r\nIn return for this the Commons preferred a petition to the king that he\r\nwould for ever remove from his presence and counsels a number of persons\r\nto whom they alleged it was owing both that his possessions had been\r\ndiminished, and that the laws had not been carried into execution.\r\nForemost on the list was the Duke of Somerset; and with him were named\r\nAlice, widow of the late Duke of Suffolk, William Booth, Bishop of\r\nChester (that is to say, of Coventry and Lichfield),[94-1] Lord Dudley,\r\nThomas Daniel, and twenty-five others. It was petitioned that they\r\nshould never again be permitted to come within twelve miles of the royal\r\npresence, on pain of forfeiture of lands and goods. But the days had not\r\nyet come when a petition against ministers by the Commons was tantamount\r\nto their dismissal. The king indeed felt it best on this occasion to\r\nyield somewhat; but he yielded on no principle whatever. He declared in\r\nreply that he himself saw no cause for their removal; but he was content\r\nto dismiss the most of them for a year, during which period accusations\r\nbrought against any of them might be inquired into. Those who were Peers\r\nof the realm, however, he refused to send away; and he insisted on\r\nretaining the services of one or two others who had been accustomed\r\ncontinually to wait upon him.[94-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 93-3: _Rolls of Parl._ v. 217.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 94-1: The modern see of Chester was separated from this\r\n    diocese in the time of Henry VIII.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 94-2: _Rolls of Parl._ v. 216.]\r\n\r\nParliament seems shortly after this to have been dissolved, and no\r\nparliament met again till two years later. Of course the influence of\r\nSomerset increased when both Lords and Commons were dismissed into the\r\ncountry; and we perceive that by the end of the year Thomas Daniel, one\r\nof the old unpopular adherents of the Duke of Suffolk, who,\r\nnevertheless, had not always been acceptable to the Court, was expecting\r\nto recover favour by means of Somerset.[94-3] He is represented as\r\nhaving cultivated the Duke’s friendship for a quarter of a year; so that\r\nwe may conclude Somerset’s ascendency was at this time unmistakable.\r\nWith what degree of discretion he made use of it there is little\r\nevidence to show. One advantage that Daniel hoped to gain through his\r\ninfluence was the friendship of Tuddenham and Heydon, by whose means,\r\nand by the good offices of Lord Scales, he expected to be allowed to\r\nre-enter the manor of Bradeston, of which he had already dispossessed\r\none Osbert Munford last year, but had subsequently been dispossessed\r\nhimself. The value of a disputed title in any part of England probably\r\ndepended very much upon who was supreme at Court.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 94-3: No. 206. Daniel had been out of favour at one time\r\n    during Suffolk’s ascendency. _See_ No. 75, p. 86.]\r\n\r\nBut high as Somerset stood in the king’s favour, the course of events\r\ndid not tend to make him more acceptable to the people. The loss of\r\nNormandy, in the preceding year, was itself a thing not likely to be\r\nreadily forgotten; but the misfortunes of the English arms did not end\r\nwith the loss of Normandy. So great, indeed, was the despondency\r\noccasioned by that event that, in the opinion of French writers, Calais\r\nitself would not have been able to hold out if the French had\r\nimmediately proceeded to attack it. But Charles was afraid he might have\r\nbeen deserted by the Duke of Burgundy, whose interests would hardly have\r\nbeen promoted by the French king strengthening himself in that quarter,\r\nand he declined to attempt it.[95-1] Relieved, however, of the necessity\r\nof maintaining a large force in Normandy, he found new occupation for\r\nhis troops in completing the conquest of Guienne, of which a beginning\r\nhad already been made by the capture of Cognac and of some places near\r\nBayonne and the Pyrenees. In November 1450 the French laid siege to\r\nBourg and Blaye on the Garonne, both of which places capitulated in the\r\nspring of the following year. They were the keys of the more important\r\ncity of Bordeaux, which, now perceiving that there was no hope of\r\nsuccour from England, was obliged to follow their example. This was in\r\nJune 1451. [Sidenote: Loss of Gascony and Guienne.] Two months\r\nafterwards Bayonne, too, was obliged to capitulate; and with it the\r\nwhole of Gascony and Guienne was as completely lost to the English as\r\nNormandy had been in the preceding year. Calais was now all that\r\nremained to them of their conquests and possessions in France; nor were\r\nthey without considerable apprehension that they might be expelled from\r\nCalais too.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 95-1: Basin, i. 247-48.]\r\n\r\nThese disasters, which were but the natural sequel to the loss of\r\nNormandy, only served to make more bitter the reflection how the\r\ngovernment of that duchy had been taken out of the able hands of the\r\nDuke of York and given to the incompetent Somerset. The jealousy with\r\nwhich the latter regarded his rival was heightened by the consciousness\r\nof his own unpopularity. The Duke of York was living in seclusion at his\r\ncastle of Ludlow, but Somerset seems to have regarded him with daily\r\nincreasing apprehension. He was continually instilling into the king\r\ndistrust of York’s fidelity as a subject; until at last the latter\r\nthought it expedient to make a public declaration of his loyalty.\r\n[Sidenote: York’s manifesto.] He accordingly issued the following\r\nmanifesto:--\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: A.D. 1452.]\r\n\r\n  Forasmuch as I, Richard Duke of York, am informed that the King, my\r\n  sovereign lord, is my heavy lord, greatly displeased with me, and\r\n  hath in me a distrust by sinister information of mine enemies,\r\n  adversaries, and evil-willers, where[as] God knoweth, from whom\r\n  nothing is hid, I am, and have been, and ever will be, his true\r\n  liegeman, and so have I before this, divers times, as well by mouth\r\n  as by writing, notified and declared to my said sovereign lord: And\r\n  for that this notice so comen unto me of the displeasure of my said\r\n  sovereign lord is to me so grievous, I have prayed the reverend\r\n  father in God, the Bishop of Hereford,[96-1] and my cousin the Earl\r\n  of Shrewsbury, to come hither and hear my declaration in this\r\n  matter; wherein I have said to them that I am true liegeman to the\r\n  King my sovereign lord, ever have been, and shall be to my dying\r\n  day. And to the very proof that it is so, I offer myself to swear\r\n  that on the blessed Sacrament, and receive it, the which I hope\r\n  shall be my salvation at the day of doom. And so for my special\r\n  comfort and consolation I have prayed the said lords to report and\r\n  declare unto the King’s highness my said offer; and to the end and\r\n  intent that I will be ready to do the same oath in presence of two\r\n  or three lords, such as shall please the King’s highness to send\r\n  hither to accept it. In witness whereof I have signed this schedule\r\n  with my sign manual, and set thereunto my signet of arms. Written in\r\n  my castle of Ludlow, the 9th of January, the 30th year of the reign\r\n  of my sovereign lord, King Henry the Sixth.[96-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 96-1: Reginald Butler or Boulers, whose appointment to\r\n    the see, dated 23rd December 1450, was no doubt due to the Duke of\r\n    York’s influence.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 96-2: Stow’s _Chronicle_, p. 393.]\r\n\r\nHe appears to have waited nearly a month to learn the effect of this\r\nremonstrance. Meanwhile reports came that the French were advancing to\r\nlay siege to Calais. At such a juncture it was peculiarly intolerable\r\nthat the administration of affairs should still be intrusted to hands so\r\nnotoriously incompetent as those of Somerset; and York, as being the\r\nonly man who could stir in such a matter with effect, now made up his\r\nmind to take active steps for Somerset’s removal. Nothing, however,\r\ncould be done for such an object without a considerable force of armed\r\nmen to support him. York accordingly issued the following address to the\r\nburgesses of Shrewsbury:--\r\n\r\n  Right worshipful friends, I recommend me unto you; and I suppose it\r\n  is well known unto you, as well by experience as by common language\r\n  said and reported throughout all Christendom, what laud, what\r\n  worship, honour, and manhood, was ascribed of all nations unto the\r\n  people of this realm whilst the kingdom’s sovereign lord stood\r\n  possessed of his lordship in the realm of France and duchy of\r\n  Normandy; and what derogation, loss of merchandize, lesion of\r\n  honour, and villany, is said and reported generally unto the English\r\n  nation for loss of the same; namely (_i.e._ especially) unto the\r\n  Duke of Somerset, when he had the commandance and charge thereof:\r\n  the which loss hath caused and encouraged the King’s enemies for to\r\n  conquer and get Gascony and Guienne, and now daily they make their\r\n  advance for to lay siege unto Calais, and to other places in the\r\n  marches there, for to apply them to their obeisance, and so for to\r\n  come into the land with great puissance, to the final destruction\r\n  thereof, if they might prevail, and to put the land in their\r\n  subjection, which God defend. And on the other part it is to be\r\n  supposed it is not unknown to you how that, after my coming out of\r\n  Ireland I, as the King’s true liegeman and servant (and ever shall\r\n  be to my life’s end) and for my true acquittal, perceiving the\r\n  inconvenience before rehearsed, advised his Royal Majesty of certain\r\n  articles concerning the weal and safeguard, as well of his most\r\n  royal person, as the tranquillity and conservation of all this his\r\n  realm: the which advertisements, howbeit that it was thought that\r\n  they were full necessary, were laid apart, and to be of none effect,\r\n  through the envy, malice, and untruth of the said Duke of Somerset;\r\n  which for my truth, faith, and allegiance that I owe unto the King,\r\n  and the good will and favour that I have to all the realm, laboreth\r\n  continually about the King’s highness for my undoing, and to corrupt\r\n  my blood, and to disinherit me and my heirs, and such persons as be\r\n  about me, without any desert or cause done or attempted, on my part\r\n  or theirs, I make our Lord Judge. Wherefore, worshipful friends, to\r\n  the intent that every man shall know my purpose and desire for to\r\n  declare me such as I am, I signify unto you that, with the help and\r\n  supportation of Almighty God, and of Our Lady, and of all the\r\n  Company of Heaven, I, after long sufferance and delays, [though it\r\n  is] not my will or intent to displease my sovereign lord, seeing\r\n  that the said Duke ever prevaileth and ruleth about the King’s\r\n  person, [and] that by this means the land is likely to be destroyed,\r\n  am fully concluded to proceed in all haste against him with the help\r\n  of my kinsmen and friends; in such wise that it shall prove to\r\n  promote ease, peace, tranquillity, and safeguard of all this land:\r\n  and more, keeping me within the bounds of my liegeance, as it\r\n  pertaineth to my duty, praying and exhorting you to fortify,\r\n  enforce, and assist me, and to come to me with all diligence,\r\n  wheresoever I shall be, or draw, with as many goodly and likely men\r\n  as ye may, to execute the intent abovesaid. Written under my signet\r\n  at my castle of Ludlow, the 3rd day of February.\r\n\r\n  Furthermore I pray you that such strait appointment and ordinance be\r\n  made that the people which shall come in your fellowship, or be sent\r\n  unto me by your agreement, be demeaned in such wise by the way, that\r\n  they do no offence, nor robbery, nor oppression upon the people, in\r\n  lesion of justice. Written as above, etc.\r\n\r\n    Your good friend,\r\n    R. YORK.[98-1]\r\n\r\n    To my right worshipful friends, the bailiffs, burgesses and\r\n    commons of the good town of Shrewsbury.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 98-1: Ellis’s _Letters_, First Series, i. 11-13.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: York marches towards London.] Having thus collected a\r\nsufficient body of followers, the duke began his march to London. The\r\nEarl of Devonshire, Lord Cobham, and other noblemen also collected\r\npeople and joined him.[98-2] The king and Somerset, however, being\r\ninformed of his intentions, set out from the capital to meet him,\r\nissuing, at the same time, an imperative summons to Lord Cobham, and\r\nprobably to the duke’s other adherents, to repair immediately to the\r\nroyal presence.[98-3] But the duke, who had no desire to engage the\r\nking’s forces, turned aside and hoped to reach London unmolested. He\r\nsent a herald before him to desire liberty for himself and his allies to\r\nenter the city; but strict injunctions to the contrary had been left by\r\nthe king, and his request was refused. Disappointed in this quarter, it\r\nwas natural that he should look for greater sympathy in Kent, where,\r\ndoubtless, smouldered still the remains of past disaffection. He\r\naccordingly crossed the Thames at Kingston Bridge, and proceeded with\r\nhis host to Dartford. The king’s army followed and pitched their camp\r\nupon Blackheath. And so, on the 1st of March 1452, there lay, within\r\neight miles of each other, two formidable hosts, which any further\r\nmovement must apparently bring into collision.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 98-2: _English Chronicle_ (ed. Davies), 69.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 98-3: Nicolas’s _Privy Council Proceedings_, vi. 116.\r\n    According to Fabyan, the king and Somerset set out on the 16th of\r\n    February. The summons to Lord Cobham, though dated Westminster,\r\n    was issued on the 17th.]\r\n\r\nTo judge from one contemporary account,[99-1] the duke’s position must\r\nhave been a strong one. He had a body of ordnance in the field, with no\r\nless than 3000 gunners. He himself had 8000 men in the centre of his\r\nposition; while the Earl of Devonshire lay to the south with another\r\ndetachment of 6000, and Lord Cobham by the river-side commanded an equal\r\nforce. Seven ships lay on the water filled with the baggage of the\r\ntroops. But the strength of the king’s army appears to have largely\r\nexceeded these numbers;[99-2] and even if the duke had wished to provoke\r\na conflict, it was evidently more prudent to remain simply on the\r\ndefensive. He accordingly left the responsibility of further action to\r\nthose of the king’s party.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 99-1: _Cottonian Roll_, ii. 23. _See_ Appendix to this\r\n    Introduction.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 99-2: _Rolls of Parl._ v. 346. The statement in the Act\r\n    of Attainder passed against the Duke of York seven years\r\n    afterwards, that he was ‘of no power to withstand’ the king on\r\n    this occasion, is liable to suspicion, but it is confirmed by the\r\n    testimony of Whethamstede, 348.]\r\n\r\nIn this crisis the lords who were with the king took counsel together,\r\nand determined, if possible, to labour for a compromise.[99-3] An\r\nembassy was appointed to go to the Duke of York, and hear what he had to\r\nsay. It consisted of the wise and good prelate Waynflete, Bishop of\r\nWinchester, and Bourchier, Bishop of Ely (afterwards Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury), the Earls of Salisbury and Warwick, Lord Beauchamp, Lord\r\nSudeley, and some others. The answer made by York was, that no ill was\r\nintended against either the king or any of his Council; that the duke\r\nand his followers were lovers of the commonweal; but that it was their\r\nintention to remove from the king certain evil-disposed persons, through\r\nwhose means the common people had been grievously oppressed. Of these\r\nthe Duke of Somerset was declared to be the chief; and, indeed, his\r\nunpopularity was such that even those on the king’s side would seem to\r\nhave seconded the Duke of York’s demand. After a consultation the king\r\nconsented that Somerset should be committed to custody until he should\r\nmake answer to such charges as York would bring against him.[100-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 99-3: ‘The Lords, both spiritual and temporal, took the\r\n    matter in hand.’ _Three Fifteenth Century Chronicles_ (Camden\r\n    Soc.), 69. So also _Chronicle of London_, 137.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 100-1: Fabyan.]\r\n\r\nNothing more seemed necessary to avert civil war. On a simple pledge\r\ngiven by the king that Somerset should be placed in confinement, and\r\nafterwards put on his trial, the Duke of York at once broke up his camp\r\nand ordered his men home. He then repaired himself to the king’s tent to\r\nexpress his loyalty. [Sidenote: York is entrapped,] But no sooner had he\r\narrived there than he found he was deceived. The king, in violation of\r\nhis promise, kept the Duke of Somerset attending upon him as his chief\r\nadviser, and York was virtually a prisoner. He was sent on to London in\r\nadvance of the king, in a kind of honourable custody, attended by two\r\nbishops, who conducted him to his own residence; but what to do with him\r\nwhen he got there was a difficulty. His enemies feared to send him to\r\nthe Tower. There were 10,000 men yet remaining in the Welsh Marches,\r\nwho, on such a rumour, would have come up to London; and it was not very\r\nlong before they were reported to be all under arms, and actually on the\r\nmarch, with the duke’s young son at their head--Edward, Earl of March,\r\nboy as he was, not yet quite ten years old.[100-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 100-2: Fabyan. _Three Fifteenth Century Chronicles_, 69,\r\n    and the MS. Chronicle, Vitell. A. xvi.]\r\n\r\nYork had distinctly accused the Duke of Somerset as a traitor. He was\r\nnow in Somerset’s power, but the latter did not dare to retort the\r\ncharge upon him. Yet if Somerset was not a traitor, the course pursued\r\nby York was utterly indefensible. He had actually taken up arms against\r\nthe Crown, to remove by force the minister in whom the king had placed\r\nhis confidence. But unfortunately Somerset knew too well that if he made\r\nthis a ground of accusation against his rival, recrimination would be\r\nsure to follow, and he himself would incur a weight of public odium\r\nwhich might possibly lead to the same result as in the case of Suffolk.\r\nThe wisest and most politic course for himself was not to impeach the\r\nDuke of York, but, if possible, to shut his mouth and let him go free.\r\nNo accusation, therefore, was drawn up. [Sidenote: and compelled to\r\nswear allegiance.] An oath of allegiance, binding him over to keep the\r\npeace in time coming, was all that was required. It was on the 1st of\r\nMarch that York had repaired to the king’s tent and found himself in his\r\nrival’s power. On the 10th he was brought to St. Paul’s, and there\r\npublicly made oath as follows:--\r\n\r\n  I, Richard, Duke of York, confess and beknow that I am and ought to\r\n  be humble subject and liegeman to you, my sovereign Lord, King Henry\r\n  the Sixth, and owe therefore to bear you faith and truth as to my\r\n  sovereign lord, and shall do all the days unto my life’s end; and\r\n  shall not at any time will or assent, that anything be attempted or\r\n  done against your noble person, but wheresoever I shall have\r\n  knowledge of any such thing imagined or purposed I shall, with all\r\n  the speed and diligence possible to me, make that your Highness\r\n  shall have knowledge thereof, and even do all that shall be possible\r\n  to me to the withstanding thereof, to the utterest of my life.\r\nI   shall not in no wise any thing take upon me against your royal\r\n  estate or the obeisance that is due thereto, nor suffer any other\r\n  man to do, as far forth as it shall lie in my power to let it; and\r\n  also I shall come at your commandment, whensoever I shall be called\r\n  by the same, in humble and obeisant wise, but if [_i.e._ unless] I\r\n  be letted by any sickness or impotency of my person or by such other\r\n  causes as shall be thought reasonable to you, my sovereign lord.\r\nI   shall never hereafter take upon me to gather any routs, or make any\r\n  assembly of your people, without your commandment or licence, or in\r\n  my lawful defence. In the interpretation of which my lawful defence,\r\n  and declaration thereof, I shall report me at all times to your\r\n  Highness, and, if the case require, unto my peers: nor anything\r\n  attempt by way of faite against any of your subjects, of what\r\n  estate, degree, or condition that they be. But whensoever I find\r\n  myself wronged or aggrieved, I shall sue humbly for remedy to your\r\n  Highness, and proceed after the course of your laws, and in none\r\n  other wise, saving in mine own lawful defence in manner above said;\r\n  and shall in all things abovesaid and other have me unto your\r\n  Highness as an humble and true subject ought to have him to his\r\n  Sovereign Lord.\r\n\r\n  All these things above said I promise truly to observe and keep, by\r\n  the Holy Evangelists contained in this book that I lay my hand upon,\r\n  and by the Holy Cross that I here touch, and by the blessed\r\n  Sacrament of our Lord’s body that I shall now with His mercy\r\n  receive. And over this I agree me and will that if I any time\r\n  hereafter, as with the grace of our Lord I never shall, anything\r\n  attempt by way of fear or otherwise against your royal majesty and\r\n  obeisance that I owe thereto, or anything I take upon me otherwise\r\n  than is above expressed, I from that time forth be unabled, [held\r\n  and taken as an untrue and openly forsworn man, and unable][102-1]\r\n  to all manner of worship, estate, and degree, be it such as I now\r\n  occupy, or any other that might grow unto me in any wise.\r\n\r\n  And this I here have promised and sworn proceedeth of mine own\r\n  desire and free voluntee and by no constraining or coercion. In\r\n  witness of all the which things above written I, Richard, Duke of\r\n  York above named, subscribe me with mine own hand and seal, with\r\n  this mine own seal, &c.[102-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 102-1: These words are not in the copy in the _Rolls\r\n    of Parliament_, but they occur in that given in Holinshed’s\r\n    _Chronicle_.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 102-2: _Rolls of Parl._ v. 346.]\r\n\r\nWith this guarantee for his future loyalty, the duke was permitted to\r\nreturn into his own country.\r\n\r\nSomerset might well be pleased that the matter should be settled thus;\r\nfor if the charges York brought, or at least was prepared to have\r\nbrought, against him were only one-half true (and some of them certainly\r\nwere true altogether), his administration of the Duchy of Normandy was a\r\nmixture of indiscretion and dishonesty at which the nation had good\r\nright to be indignant. We have already seen how in concert with the Duke\r\nof Suffolk he had authorised a perfidious breach of the truce with\r\nFrance in the capture of Fougères. We have also seen how ill prepared he\r\nwas for the consequences; how he discovered too late the weakness of all\r\nthe garrisons; how the French king recovered town after town, and the\r\nEnglish were finally expelled from Normandy in less than a year and a\r\nhalf after the unjustifiable outrage. [Sidenote: York’s charges against\r\nSomerset.] But if any credit may be given to the further charges\r\nbrought against him by the Duke of York,--charges which agree only\r\ntoo well with the character attributed to him by the most impartial\r\nauthorities[102-3]--Somerset had himself to blame in great measure for\r\nthe defenceless condition of the country committed to his protection.\r\nOn his first going into Normandy he had jobbed the offices under his\r\ncontrol. For the sake of private emolument he had removed a number of\r\ntrusty and experienced captains, filling their places with creatures of\r\nhis own, or men who had paid _douceurs_ for their posts; and only on\r\nreceipt of still greater bribes would he consent to restore any of those\r\nthat had been put out. He had, however, actually reduced many garrisons,\r\nwhile he had taxed the inhabitants of the Duchy beyond all reason for\r\nthe means of defence. His administration of justice, too, had been such\r\nas to excite the most vehement dissatisfaction, and had made the whole\r\nnative population impatient of English government. He had, moreover,\r\npocketed the compensation given by France to the dispossessed Englishmen\r\nof Anjou and Maine. Worse still, after all his maladministration and ill\r\nsuccess, he had prevailed on the king to make him captain of Calais,\r\nwhich it seemed as if he was on the point of losing also in as careless\r\nand culpable a manner as he had already lost Normandy.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 102-3: The character given of the Duke of Somerset by\r\n    the contemporary historian Basin is on the whole favourable, and\r\n    may be supposed to be impartial. He describes him as handsome in\r\n    person, gentle and urbane in manner, and well inclined towards\r\n    justice; but all these graces were marred by an insatiable avarice\r\n    which would not let him rest content with the immense wealth he\r\n    had inherited from Cardinal Beaufort; and by continually coveting\r\n    the riches of others he brought ruin on himself. Basin, i. 193.]\r\n\r\nHere, however, is the full text of the accusation,[103-1] as prepared by\r\nYork himself:--\r\n\r\n  Thies articles and pointes folowyng yeve, shewe and ministre I,\r\n  Richard Duc of York, youre true liegman and servaunt unto youre\r\n  highnesse, summarily purposyng and declaryng thaym ayeinst Edmond\r\n  Duc of Somerset for the grete welfare and the comen availle and\r\n  interesse of youre mageste Roiall and of this youre noble roialme,\r\n  aswell to bryng to knawlege and understondyng the meanes and causes\r\n  of the grete myscheves and inconvenientz which late befe[l] unto\r\n  this youre said noble roiame, as in losse of youre lyvelode by yonde\r\n  thee see and otherwyse in ponisshment of deservitours and excuse of\r\n  innocencie, and also in puttyng aside and eschuyng of the grete and\r\n  importable hurte and prejudice which ben like, withouten that\r\n  purviaunce be had of remedie, to succede in shorte tyme. To the\r\n  which articles and every of theym I, the seid Duc of York, desire of\r\n  youre egall and indifferent rightwesnesse that the seid Edmond\r\n  answere by his feith and trouth, the sacrement of his othe\r\n  thereuppon made, duly and truly as lawe and conscience requireth;\r\nI   also desiryng, for the veraly examinacion and knowlech of trouth\r\n  theruppon to be had, and for the grete and singuler weel of this\r\n  youre said Roiame, to be admytted to the prefe, and to yeve evidence\r\n  in the said articles that folowyn in such as he woll denye, after\r\n  the equite and consideracion of lawe in such case, and processe had,\r\n  and also of good feith and conscience justice thereafter to be don\r\n  and executid.\r\n\r\n  First, I article and declare that the seid Edmond Duc of Somersett\r\n  hath be meane, consenter, occasioner, cause and mediatour, both by\r\n  his inwarde knowlege and expresse consent, by counseill, and\r\n  worchyng thurghe diverse subtyle weyes and meanes, as by violent\r\n  presumpcion and otherwyse is knowen and understonde, and furthermore\r\n  also by his inordinate negligence, lacchesse and wilfull\r\n  rechelessnes and insaciate covetyse, of the losse and amission of\r\n  youre Duchie of Normandie, rejoissed and possessed at this tyme, for\r\n  the defence of his negligent kepyng and otherwyse before reherced,\r\n  by youre enemyes. Which may clerly by (_sic_) understonde by the\r\n  meanes and causes that folowen; of the which and for such one he is\r\n  openly called, reputed and had by the comen fame and voice. Of the\r\n  which oon cause is that the seid Duc of Somersett, at his first\r\n  comyng into Normandie, chaunged and putt out of theire occupacion\r\n  and youre service, withoute skyll, cause or reason, all the true and\r\n  feithfull officers, for the most partie, of all Normandie, and put\r\n  in such as hym liked for his owne singuler availe and covetyse, as\r\n  it apperith well, inasmoch as ther coude noon of theym that were so\r\n  put out be restored agayn withoute grete giftes and rewardes, which\r\n  was full unfittyng. And furthermore did put in prison many diverse\r\n  and notable persones of youre seid Duchie, withoute cause, justice\r\n  or any ordinarie processe made agayn theym or due examinacion, and\r\n  by that meane did grete extorcions and rered unlawfully grete sommes\r\n  undre colour of amendes and composicions, wherby the cuntre for such\r\n  wrong and faute of justice grucched sore agayn hym and his\r\n  governaunce and caused the people to arise in theire conseytes and\r\n  to take grete displeasir; and that was a grete occasion and cause of\r\n  the losse of youre said Duchie of Normandie.\r\n\r\n  Item, the seid Edmond Duc of Somerset was cause and consenter\r\n  voluntarie of the brekyng of the trues and pais for a tyme had\r\n  betwene youre highnes and youre uncle of Fraunce, which was well\r\n  understond at the taking of Fogiers in Britaigne by Sir Fraunceys\r\n  Larragonneys thurgh his avise, consentement, and counseile; and also\r\n  duryng the said trues made more strong and fortified diverse places\r\n  disopered by youre commaundement, as Morteyn and Seint Jakes de\r\n  Beveron, ageyn the appointement of the seid trues; uppon which youre\r\n  uncle did sommon hym to make a-seeth [_satisfaction_] and for to\r\n  disimpaire the seid fortifying and wrong don agayn the trues, and in\r\n  asmoch as non aseeth by hym was don, nor [he] lefte not of his seid\r\n  fortifiyng, caused youre seid uncle to have, as he pretende, cause\r\n  to breke the said trues on his partie; which brekyng of trues was\r\n  oon of the verray cause of losse of Normandie. And thus he brake the\r\n  seide trues ayeinst his promysse and true feith made to youre\r\n  highnes, which was to kepe and entretyn the said trues, and so did\r\n  ayen the lawe in this behalve and youre statutes of the roiame.\r\n\r\n  Item, he put away and diminisshed diverse garnisons and other strong\r\n  places of youre seid Duchie of Normandie of soudiours and of men of\r\n  werre which were accustumed to abide uppon the suerte and saufgarde\r\n  of the same, howe be hit he had verrayly knowlege that youre ennmyes\r\n  were full determi[ned] for to ley seges to put the same places in\r\n  theire subjeccion, not paiyng duely nor contentyng such soudiours as\r\n  abode uppon the defences of the same places; he reryng at that tyme\r\n  in youre said Duchie as grete tailles and aides as were in long tyme\r\n  before duryng the werre; and that caused the soudiours in diverse\r\n  strong places for poverte, not havyng hors nor harneys, and also the\r\n  nombre diminisshed, to be of non poiaire to make resistence, and\r\n  that was a grete cause of the losse of Normandie.

The\r\n    first paragraph of this document is quoted by Stowe in his\r\n    _Chronicle_, p. 397, and the charges are referred by him to the\r\n    thirty-third year of the king’s reign, _i.e._ the latter part of\r\n    A.D. 1454, which is certainly erroneous. The date which he\r\n    intended, indeed, was the latter part of the year 1453, when the\r\n    Duke of Somerset was arrested and sent to the Tower; but this date\r\n    also is quite impossible.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 106-1: MS. mutilated.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 106-2: A line seems here to be cut off in the MS. at\r\n    the bottom of the leaf.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 107-1: Charles, afterwards Charles the Bold, son of\r\n    Philip the Good, who was at this time Duke of Burgundy.]\r\n\r\n  [[Anjoy and Mayn iij.{xx} xij.{m} (72,000) frankes\r\n  _the letters shown as {superscripts} were printed directly above\r\n  the preceding numbers_]\r\n\r\nI imagine this paper must have been really handed in by York to the\r\nlords of the king’s Council. It is preserved among the MSS. in the\r\nCottonian Library, a large number of which were undoubtedly at one time\r\npart of the public records of the realm. But in any case we can hardly\r\ndoubt that Somerset understood quite sufficiently the grounds on which\r\nhe was so generally hated; nor is it by any means improbable that the\r\narmed remonstrance of the Duke of York produced some real effect, if\r\nonly for a time. This at least we know, that only four days after the\r\noath taken by York at St. Paul’s, active and energetic measures began to\r\nbe taken for the defence of Calais. [Sidenote: Defence of Calais.]\r\nHistorians, as Sir Harris Nicolas truly remarks, do not seem hitherto to\r\nhave been aware of the imminent danger in which even Calais at this time\r\nstood of being lost, like the other English conquests, a full century\r\nbefore it was actually recovered by the French. Rumours that Calais\r\nwould be besieged reached England in the beginning of May 1450, along\r\nwith the news of the Duke of Suffolk’s murder.[108-1] In August 1451 a\r\nreinforcement of 1150 men was sent thither in twelve vessels, under the\r\nLords Beauchamp and Sudeley. In the February following, as we have seen,\r\nYork wrote of the success of the French in Gascony having emboldened\r\nthem to lay siege to Calais again. And now, on the 14th of March, when\r\nCharles was advancing towards the last English stronghold, with the most\r\nformidable army that had been seen for years, and when men had begun to\r\nfear that he would be able not only to gain possession of Calais with\r\nease, but even to invade and ravage England, steps were at last taken\r\nfor the immediate formation of a fleet.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 108-1: Letter 121.]\r\n\r\nA royal navy had undoubtedly existed for a long time before the days of\r\nHenry VI., but it never amounted in itself to a very formidable force,\r\nand in time of war recourse was always had to impressment on the large\r\nscale. But the neglect of the sea was during this reign the constant\r\ncomplaint of Englishmen. For want of an efficient fleet the mercantile\r\ninterest continually suffered, the fisheries could not safely be\r\nvisited, and even the dwellers at home were insecure. The fact was\r\nconfessed by the greatest eulogists of Henry VI., who had not a thought\r\nof impugning his government. ‘Our enemies,’ says Capgrave in his\r\n_Illustrious Henries_,--‘Our enemies laugh at us. They say, “Take off\r\nthe ship from your precious money, and stamp a sheep upon it to signify\r\nyour sheepish minds.” We who used to be conquerors of all nations are\r\nnow conquered by all. The men of old used to say that the sea was\r\nEngland’s wall, and now our enemies have got upon the wall; what think\r\nyou they will do to the defenceless inhabitants? Because this business\r\nhas been neglected for so many years it now happens that ships are\r\nscanty, and sailors also few, and such as we have unskilled for want of\r\nexercise. May God take away our reproach and raise up a spirit of\r\nbravery in our nation!’[109-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 109-1: _Capgrave de Illust. Henricis_, 135.]\r\n\r\nThere were already available for the king’s service a certain number of\r\nships in the Thames, and at Winchelsea and Sandwich. The chief of these\r\nvessels was called the _Grace Dieu_--a name which was perhaps\r\ntraditional, for it was handed down to Tudor times when, with the king’s\r\nown Christian name prefixed, it was always given to the largest of the\r\nfleet.[109-2] The Earl of Shrewsbury[110-1] was appointed to take the\r\ncommand of the whole army at sea, and efforts were made to augment the\r\nsquadron with as large a force as possible. On the 14th of March 1452 a\r\ncommission was given to Lord Clifford, which was doubtless one of a\r\nnumber given to various noblemen, to negotiate for this purpose with\r\nshipowners, knights, and gentlemen in the district where he commonly\r\nresided; and he was instructed to take the command of all such vessels\r\nas he could raise, and bring them into the Downs to join with\r\nShrewsbury. The appeal to patriotism was not made in vain. Many\r\nshipowners came forward, offering not only to lend but to victual their\r\nown ships for the service. But full powers were also given to arrest\r\nships, shipmasters, and mariners, to make up a sufficient number. To\r\nevery man not furnished with victuals by the benevolence of others,\r\ntwelve pence a week was offered on the king’s behalf, with a customary\r\nshare in any booty that he might help to capture at sea. Captains of\r\nships were to have in addition a reward of ten marks, or £10, at the\r\ndiscretion of Lord Clifford. Altogether we may presume that the\r\ndefensive measures taken at this time were sufficient, for we hear no\r\nmore during the next few years of any attempt to lay siege to Calais.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 109-2: The _Henry Grace Dieu_ of Henry VIII.’s time is,\r\n    however, better known by its popular epithet of the _Great\r\n    Harry_.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 110-1: The Earl of Shrewsbury, as already mentioned, had\r\n    been given up to the French in 1449 as a hostage for the delivery\r\n    of certain towns in Normandy. It is said that he only recovered\r\n    his liberty on taking oath never to bear arms again against the\r\n    French, but that on visiting Rome in the year of Jubilee, 1450, he\r\n    obtained an absolution from this engagement.--_Æneæ Sylvii Opera_,\r\n    441.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amnesty at Home--Disaster Abroad_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General pardon.] As to internal dissensions at home, it was\r\nquite in accordance with the weakness of the king’s character to believe\r\nthat he had now stilled the chief elements of danger. His piety\r\nsuggested to him to complete the good work by a general political\r\namnesty. The year 1450, as being the concluding year of a half-century,\r\nhad been celebrated as a jubilee at Rome, during which a general\r\nindulgence and pardon were granted to all who visited the Imperial City.\r\nThere was also, according to precedent, a bull issued at the close of\r\nthe year to extend these benefits still further. Taking his example from\r\nthe great Spiritual Ruler, the king, on Good Friday, the 7th of April\r\n1452, offered publicly a general pardon to all who had been guilty of\r\nacts of disloyalty to himself, and who would apply to his Chancery for\r\nletters patent.[111-1] The offer was, undoubtedly, both gracious and\r\nhumane. It sprang from a genuine love of peace on the king’s part, and\r\nprobably went far to make the government of Somerset endurable for some\r\nmonths longer. Amid the confusion and troubles of the times, thousands\r\nmust have felt that they needed the royal clemency to protect them\r\nagainst the severity of the laws. One hundred and forty-four persons,\r\namong whom was Thomas Young of Bristol--he who had proposed in\r\nParliament that York should be proclaimed heir to the crown--obtained\r\nsealed pardons on that very Good Friday. Some two or three thousand\r\nothers laid claim to the like indulgence, and had patents granted to\r\nthem at a later date.[111-2] Only a very few persons were excepted on\r\naccount of the enormity of their offences.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 111-1: Whethamstede, 317.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 111-2: The names are all entered on the _Pardon Roll_ of\r\n    30 and 31 Henry VI. Among the hosts of less interesting names, we\r\n    find that the Duke of York took out a pardon on the 3rd of June;\r\n    the Duke of Norfolk and the young Duke of Suffolk on the 23rd of\r\n    the same month; Thomas Percy, Lord Egremont, on the 1st; Thomas\r\n    Courtenay, Earl of Devon, on the 20th, and Sir William Oldhall,\r\n    who is called of Hunsdon, on the 26th. Ralph, Lord Cromwell, had\r\n    one on the 22nd May, and Robert Wynnyngton of Dartmouth (the\r\n    writer of Letter 90) on the 28th July. On the 12th July a joint\r\n    pardon was given to Sir Henry Percy, Lord Ponynges, and Eleanor,\r\n    his wife, kinswoman and heir of Sir Robert Ponynges. At later\r\n    dates we have also pardons to Henry, Viscount Bourchier, and Sir\r\n    John Talbot, son and heir of the Earl of Shrewsbury.]\r\n\r\nOne part of his kingdom, however, Henry himself did not expect to pacify\r\nby such means only. The state of the county of Norfolk had been so\r\nrepresented to him that he felt it necessary to send thither the Duke of\r\nNorfolk. ‘Great riots, extortions, horrible wrongs and hurts,’ were the\r\nsubject of complaint, and nothing but an impartial inquiry would give\r\nsatisfaction. The duke on coming into the country issued a proclamation,\r\nurging all who had any complaints to make to lay them freely and\r\nfearlessly before him. But free and fearless evidence was not likely to\r\nbe had without a strong guarantee for the protection of witnesses.\r\nAlready the news of the duke’s coming had got wind, and some of the\r\ndependants of Lord Scales, who had been amongst the principal offenders,\r\nhad given notice that any complaints against _them_ would be redressed\r\nin another fashion after the duke’s departure. In the absence of the\r\nduke Lord Scales had been always hitherto the natural ruler of the\r\ncounty, and it was under his protection that Sir Thomas Tuddenham, Sir\r\nMiles Stapleton, John Heydon, and others had dared to make themselves\r\nunpopular. Norfolk accordingly declared in the same proclamation that he\r\nintended henceforth to vindicate for himself so long as he lived the\r\nchief power and authority in the county which bore his name, subject\r\nonly to that of the king himself. [Sidenote: Intended royal visit to\r\nNorfolk.] And to give still greater encouragement to the well-disposed,\r\nhe announced that the king himself would shortly visit the county,\r\nbefore whom all who desired it should have their grievances\r\nredressed.[112-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 112-1: No. 210.]\r\n\r\nThat the king actually visited Norfolk at this time I do not find from\r\nany other evidence. A letter written on St. George’s Day says that he\r\nhad been expected at Norwich or Claxton for ten days past. Encouraged by\r\nthe duke’s proclamation, several gentlemen of the county had drawn up a\r\ncomplaint against Charles Nowell, and were waiting to know in what\r\nmanner they should present it. [Sidenote: Complaint against Charles\r\nNowell.] This Charles and a number of others appear to have been keeping\r\nthe country east of Norwich at the time in continual alarm and\r\nconfusion. They held their rendezvous at the house of one Robert\r\nLedeham, from which they would issue out in bands of six, or twelve, or\r\nsometimes thirty or more, fully armed with bows and arrows, spears and\r\nbills, jacks and sallets.[112-2] No place was sacred from their\r\noutrages. On Mid-Lent Sunday they had attacked two servants of the\r\nBishop of Norwich inside the church at Burlingham, and would have killed\r\nthem behind the priest’s back while they were kneeling at the mass. On\r\nthe 6th of April they had endeavoured to break into the White Friars at\r\nNorwich on pretence of wishing to hear evensong; but having publicly\r\ndeclared in the town that they intended to get hold of certain citizens,\r\neither alive or dead, the doors were shut against them. Happily, before\r\nthey accomplished their purpose the mayor and aldermen came to the spot.\r\nA multitude of people had meanwhile assembled in the streets, and the\r\nrioters, finding the odds considerably against them, quietly took their\r\ndeparture.[113-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 112-2: Coats of mail and helmets.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 113-1: Nos. 211, 217, 241.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John Paston assaulted at Norwich Cathedral.] John Paston had\r\na complaint of his own to make against these wrongdoers. Charles Nowell\r\nhimself, and five others, had attacked him at the door of Norwich\r\nCathedral. He had with him at the time two servants, one of whom\r\nreceived a blow on the naked head with a sword; and he himself was\r\nseized and had his arms held behind him, while one of the company struck\r\nat him. But for a timely rescue his death would seem to have been\r\ncertain. On the very day on which this occurred his wife’s uncle, Philip\r\nBerney, was waylaid by some of the same fellowship, in the highway under\r\nThorpe Wood. Berney was riding, accompanied by a single servant, when\r\ntheir two horses first were wounded by a discharge of arrows. They were\r\nthen speedily overtaken by their assailants, who broke a bow over Philip\r\nBerney’s head, and took him prisoner, declaring him to be a traitor. To\r\ngive a further colour to their proceedings, they led him prisoner to the\r\nBishop of Norwich, demanding surety of him to keep the peace, and, when\r\nthey had obtained it, let him go. Philip Berney lived more than a year\r\nafter the adventure, but he never recovered from the effects of this\r\nrough usage.[113-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 113-2: Nos. 212, 213, 227, 228, 241.]\r\n\r\nOutrages like these, it must be remembered, were not the work of lawless\r\nbrigands and recognised enemies of the whole community. They were merely\r\nthe effect of party spirit. The men who did them were supported by\r\nnoblemen and country gentlemen. One, by name Roger Church, probably the\r\nmost daring, and at the same time the most subtle, of the gang, had got\r\nhimself made bailiff of the hundred of Blofield.[113-3] Charles Nowell\r\nwas a friend of Thomas Daniel, who, after being a year and a half out of\r\nfavour, had recently recovered his influence in Norfolk through the\r\nmedium of the Duke of Somerset.[114-1] By this means he seems again to\r\nhave obtained possession of the manor of Bradeston, the right to which\r\nhe had disputed in 1450, apparently more by arms than by law, with\r\nOsbert Mountford, marshal of Calais. Charles Nowell was appointed by\r\nDaniel bailiff of the manor, with the slender but not insignificant\r\nsalary of twopence a day; and he and his fellows, Roger Church, Robert\r\nLedeham, John Ratcliff, and Robert Dalling, made it their chief business\r\nto maintain Daniel in possession.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 113-3: Nos. 214, 241.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 114-1: No. 206.]\r\n\r\nTo put an end to such a state of matters as this, the Duke of Norfolk’s\r\ncoming must have been truly welcome. But if any man expected that the\r\npower of duke or king could suddenly terminate the reign of anarchy, and\r\ninitiate an era of plain impartial justice, he must have been a sanguine\r\nmortal. As one of the first effects of the duke’s coming, some of the\r\nleading oppressors of the country were driven to a course of chicanery\r\ninstead of violence. [Sidenote: Roger Church.] Roger Church got himself\r\narrested by some of his own company, and was brought before the duke as\r\na promoter of sedition. He was accused of having taken part in an\r\nunlawful assembly at Postwick, with the view of stirring up an\r\ninsurrection. He confessed the fact, and offered to turn king’s evidence\r\non his accomplices. He then named a number of thrifty husbandmen,\r\nfarmers, and gentlemen of the neighbourhood, alleging that about three\r\nhundred persons were implicated in the intended rising. The truth, as it\r\npresently turned out, and as Church himself afterwards confessed, was,\r\nthat the movement had been got up by himself, at the instigation of\r\nRobert Ledeham, who promised to procure his pardon through the influence\r\nof Daniel. By solicitations addressed to various unsteady characters he\r\nhad induced some to believe that an insurrection would be well\r\nsupported. A little company of fifteen men accordingly met him under a\r\nwood at Postwick, and he told them he had discovered an excellent name\r\nfor their captain, who should be called John Amend-All. But beyond this\r\nmeeting and naming of the captain nothing seems ever to have come of the\r\nproject.[114-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 114-2: Nos. 214, 217, 218, 219, 241.]\r\n\r\nJohn Paston was certainly one of those mentioned by Church. The chief\r\npersons accused were the friends of Osbert Mountford, and Paston was one\r\nof them. But John Falgate, one of the deluded victims who had been\r\npresent at the meeting at Postwick, being subjected to examination\r\nbefore the sheriff, exonerated Paston, and, while acknowledging his own\r\nshare in the conspiracy, pronounced the tale told by Roger Church in his\r\nconfession to be altogether an invention. We need not be surprised to\r\nhear that after this a petition from the county of Norfolk was sent up\r\nto the Lord Chancellor, praying that Church should not be allowed the\r\nbenefit of the general pardon, offered upon Good Friday.[115-1] But\r\nChurch persevered in his policy. He appears to have been a reckless kind\r\nof adventurer. He probably claimed the benefit of clergy, for we find\r\nhim three months after his arrest in the hands of officers of the Bishop\r\nof Norwich. His goods also were seized for a debt that he owed the\r\nbishop. But in spite of the contradictions given by other witnesses, in\r\nJuly he adhered to what he had said in April, and instead of retracting\r\nhis former accusations, said he meant to impeach some one else whom he\r\ncould not at that time name,--a man who, he said, had more money in his\r\npurse than all of those whom he had accused before. The coolness with\r\nwhich he persisted in these statements gave an impression that he was\r\neven yet relying upon powerful friends to support him.[115-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 115-1: The petition, I think, must have been effectual,\r\n    for I did not find Church’s name on the _Pardon Roll_, 30 and 31\r\n    Henry VI.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 115-2: Nos. 214, 216, 218.]\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the affair must be a matter of speculation, for we\r\nhear nothing more of it. The political history of England, too, is, at\r\nthis point, almost a blank. We know from the Privy Council Proceedings\r\nthat there was some difficulty in the spring of 1452 in preserving\r\nfriendly relations with Scotland in consequence of some Border outrages\r\nperpetrated by the Earl of Douglas. And this is absolutely all the light\r\nwe have on the domestic affairs of England for about a twelvemonth after\r\nthe Duke of York’s oath of allegiance at St. Paul’s. I have found,\r\nhowever, by an examination of the dates of privy seals, [Sidenote: A\r\nroyal progress.] that in July the king began a progress into the west of\r\nEngland, which is not altogether without significance. He reached Exeter\r\non the 18th, and from thence proceeded by Wells, Gloucester, Monmouth,\r\nand Hereford to Ludlow, where he arrived on the 12th of August, and from\r\nwhich he returned homewards by Kenilworth and Woodstock, arriving at\r\nEltham in the beginning of September. In October he made another circuit\r\nnorthwards by St. Albans to Stamford, Peterborough, and Cambridge. There\r\ncan hardly be a doubt the object of these journeys was mainly to\r\nconciliate those who had declared their opposition to the Duke of\r\nSomerset, especially when we consider that the visit to Ludlow must have\r\nbeen nothing less than a visit to the Duke of York. York was now more\r\nthan pardoned. He was honoured by his sovereign.\r\n\r\nFinancially, however, we may well suppose that the duke was not the\r\nbetter of the royal visit. Perhaps also the state of the country did not\r\nconduce to the prosperity of great landowners. At all events we find\r\nthat at the end of the year York was glad to pledge some pieces of\r\njewellery to Sir John Fastolf for a loan of £437, to be repaid next\r\nMidsummer.[116-1] The transaction is in every way curious, as\r\nillustrating the sort of dealings in money matters which were at that\r\ntime by no means uncommon among knights and noblemen. It is certainly\r\nhighly characteristic of such a knight as Sir John Fastolf, who, quite\r\nunlike the Falstaff of the dramatist, instead of being always needy, was\r\nalways seeking to increase the wealth that he had amassed by long years\r\nof thrift and frugality.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 116-1: No. 223.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sir John Fastolf.] We have had occasion to mention the\r\nhistoric Fastolf before; and it is time that we should now direct\r\nattention to the circumstances of his private life and his connection\r\nwith the Paston family. John Paston, as the reader has already been\r\ninformed, was ultimately his executor, and to this circumstance may\r\nsafely be attributed the preservation of so many of his letters, most of\r\nwhich have certainly been handed down with the papers of the Paston\r\nfamily. Nevertheless, up to the time at which we have now arrived we do\r\nnot find that he directly corresponded with any of them. We can see,\r\nhowever, that he had a high regard for John Paston’s advice in business,\r\nand sometimes sent letters and documents of importance by him to his\r\nagent in Norfolk, Sir Thomas Howes.[117-1] He seems to have been related\r\nin blood to John Paston’s wife,[117-2] and he acknowledges Paston\r\nhimself as his cousin in his will. From the general tenor of most of his\r\nletters we should certainly no more suspect him of being the old soldier\r\nthat he actually was than of being Shakespeare’s fat, disorderly knight.\r\nEvery sentence in them refers to lawsuits and title-deeds, extortions\r\nand injuries received from others, forged processes affecting property,\r\nwrits of one kind or another to be issued against his adversaries,\r\nlibels uttered against himself, and matters of the like description.\r\nAltogether the perusal is apt to give us an impression that Sir John\r\nwould have made an acute and able, though perhaps not very highminded,\r\nsolicitor. If ever his agent, Sir Thomas Howes, was, or seemed to be,\r\na little remiss in regard to some particular interest, he was sure to\r\nhear of it, and yet woe to him if he did things on his own responsibility\r\nwhich turned out afterwards to be a failure.[117-3] Sir John was not the\r\nman to pass over lightly injuries done by inadvertence.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 117-1: Nos. 153, 159, 162, 186, 188, 203.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 117-2: Note the passages in Margaret Paston’s letter\r\n    (No. 222):--‘Yet I suppose Sir John, if he were spoken to, would\r\n    be gladder to let his kinsmen have part than strangers.’ And\r\n    again:--‘Assay him in my name of such places as ye suppose is most\r\n    clear.’]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 117-3: No. 202.]\r\n\r\nThe familiarity shown by Fastolf with all the forms and processes of the\r\nlaw is probably due not so much to the peculiarity of his personal\r\ncharacter as to the fact that a knowledge of legal technicalities was\r\nmuch more widely diffused in that day than it is in ours. Even in the\r\ndays when Master Shallow first made himself ridiculous to a London\r\naudience by claiming to be justice of the peace and _coram_,\r\n_custalorum_, and _ratolorum_, there can hardly be a doubt that the\r\nknowledge of legal terms and processes was not a thing so entirely\r\nprofessional as it is now. But if we go back to an earlier time, the\r\nPaston letters afford ample evidence that every man who had property to\r\nprotect, if not every well-educated woman also, was perfectly well\r\nversed in the ordinary forms of legal processes. Sir John Fastolf had a\r\ngreat deal of property to take care of, and consequently had much more\r\noccasion to make use of legal phraseology than other people. Had it been\r\notherwise we should hardly have had any letters of his at all; for the\r\nonly use of writing to him, and probably to most other people in those\r\ndays, was to communicate on matters of business.\r\n\r\nThere are also parts of his correspondence from which we might almost\r\ninfer that Sir John was a merchant as well as a lawyer. His ships were\r\ncontinually passing between London and Yarmouth, carrying on the outward\r\nvoyage building materials for his works at Caister, and bringing home\r\nmalt or other produce from the county of Norfolk. In two of his letters\r\nwe have references to his little ship _The Blythe_,[118-1] which,\r\nhowever, was only one of several; for, in the year 1443, he obtained a\r\nlicence from the Crown to keep no less than six vessels in his service.\r\nThese are described as of four different kinds: two being what were\r\ncalled ‘playtes,’ a third a ‘cog-ship,’ a fourth a ‘farecoft,’ and the\r\ntwo others ‘balingers,’ for the carriage of goods and building materials\r\nfor the use of his household. These vessels were to be free from all\r\nliability to arrest for the service of the king.[118-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 118-1: Nos. 171, 173.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 118-2: Rymer, xi. 44.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Building of Caister Castle.] The object of these building\r\noperations was the erection of a stately castle at Caister, not far from\r\nYarmouth, the place of the old warrior’s birth. As early as the reign of\r\nHenry V., it seems, he had obtained licence to fortify a dwelling there,\r\n‘so strong as himself could devise’;[118-3] but his occupation in the\r\nFrench wars had suspended a design which must have been a special object\r\nwith him all through life. The manor of Caister had come to him by\r\nnatural descent from his paternal ancestry; but even during his mother’s\r\nwidowhood, when Sir John was a young man of about six-and-twenty, we\r\nfind that she gave up her life tenure of it to vest it entirely in her\r\nson.[119-1] Since that day he had been abroad with Henry V. at Agincourt\r\nand at the siege of Rouen. He had afterwards served in France under the\r\nRegent Bedford,--had taken several strong castles and one illustrious\r\nprisoner,[119-2]--had held the government of conquered districts, and\r\nhad fought, generally with success and glory, in almost every great\r\nbattle of the period. Nor had he been free, even on his return to\r\nEngland, to go at once and spend the rest of his days on his paternal\r\ndomains in Norfolk. His counsels were needed by his sovereign. His\r\nexperience abroad must have qualified him to give important advice on\r\nmany subjects of vital interest touching both France and England, and we\r\nhave evidence that he was, at least occasionally, summoned to take part\r\nin the proceedings of the Privy Council. But now, when he was upwards of\r\nseventy years of age, the dream of his youth was going to be realised.\r\nMasons and bricklayers were busy at Caister,[119-3] building up for him\r\na magnificent edifice, of which the ruins are at this day the most\r\ninteresting feature in the neighbourhood. Sadly imperfect ruins indeed\r\nthey are,--in some places even the foundations would seem to have\r\ndisappeared, or else the plan of the building is not very intelligible;\r\nbut a noble tower still rises to a height of ninety feet,--its top\r\npossessed by jackdaws,--and a large extent of mouldered walls, pierced\r\nwith loopholes and surmounted by remains of battlements, enable the\r\nimagination to realise what Caister Castle must have been when it was\r\nfinished over four hundred years ago. A detached fragment of these\r\nruins, too, goes by the name of the Bargehouse; and there, beneath a\r\nlow-browed arch still visible, tradition reports that Sir John Fastolf’s\r\nbarge or barges would issue out on their voyages or enter on their\r\nreturn home.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 118-3: Dawson Turner’s _Historical Sketch of Caister\r\n    Castle_, p. 31. He does not state his authority.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 119-1: _See_ ‘Early Documents’ in vol. ii. p. 4.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 119-2: The Duke of Alençon.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 119-3: Nos. 224, 225.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Dawson Turner, the foundations of Caister Castle must have\r\nenclosed a space of more than six acres of ground.[119-4] The inventory\r\nof the furniture contained in it at Fastolf’s death[119-5] enumerates no\r\nless than six-and-twenty chambers, besides the public rooms, chapel, and\r\noffices. An edifice on such a scale must have been some time in\r\nbuilding:--many years, we should suppose, passed away before it was\r\ncompleted. And we are not without evidence that such was actually the\r\ncase; for a chamber was set apart for the Lady Milicent, Fastolf’s wife,\r\nwho is believed to have died in 1446, and yet the works were still going\r\non in 1453. In this latter year we find that John Paston was allowed to\r\nhave some control of the building operations, and that chambers were to\r\nbe built for him and his wife. Meanwhile it appears he had chosen an\r\napartment in which to set up his coffers and his counting-board for the\r\ntime. Possibly when he was able to visit Caister he may have acted as\r\npaymaster of the works.[120-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 119-4: _Historical Sketch_, p. 4.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 119-5: No. 389.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 120-1: Nos. 224, 225.]\r\n\r\nThe great castle, however, was now not far from completion; and before\r\nthe end of the following year Sir John Fastolf had removed from London\r\nand taken up his residence at Caister, where, with the exception of one\r\nsingle visit to the capital, he seems to have spent all the remainder of\r\nhis days.\r\n\r\nWe have said that very few notices are to be found of the internal\r\naffairs of England in the year 1452, subsequent to the Duke of York\r\nswearing allegiance at St. Paul’s. But just about that time, or not very\r\nlong after, the affairs of Guienne came once more to demand the serious\r\nconsideration of the Council. It is true that Guienne and Gascony were\r\nnow no longer English possessions. [Sidenote: Attempt to recover\r\nGuienne.] Bayonne, the last stronghold, had been given up in the\r\npreceding August, and, the English forces being now expelled, all hope\r\nof recovering the lost provinces might well have been abandoned, but\r\nthat the inhabitants were desirous to put themselves once more under the\r\nprotection of the King of England. The fact is that the Gascons, who had\r\nbeen three centuries under English rule, did not at all relish the\r\nchange of masters. Under the crown of England they had enjoyed a liberty\r\nand freedom from taxation which were unknown in the dominions of Charles\r\nVII.; and on the surrender of Bordeaux and Bayonne, the French king had\r\nexpressly promised to exempt them from a number of impositions levied\r\nelsewhere. But for this promise, indeed, those cities would not so\r\nreadily have come to terms.[121-1] Unfortunately, it was not very long\r\nbefore the ministers of Charles sought to evade its fulfilment. They\r\nrepresented to the people that for their own protection, and not for the\r\nbenefit of the royal treasury, the imposition of a _taille_ would enable\r\nthe king to set a sufficient guard upon the country, and that the money\r\nwould not in reality be taken from them, as it would all be spent within\r\nthe province. The English, it was to be feared, would not remain patient\r\nunder the loss, not only of the provinces themselves, but also of a very\r\nvaluable commerce that they had hitherto maintained with the south of\r\nFrance; for Gascony supplied England with wine, and was a large consumer\r\nof English wool. Hence there was every reason to fear that some attempt\r\nwould be made by the enemy to recover the lands from which he had been\r\nexpelled, and it was the interest of the inhabitants themselves to\r\nprovide an adequate force to ward off invasion.[121-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 121-1: Basin, i. 251.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 121-2: _Ibid._ 257.]\r\n\r\nWith arguments like these the French king’s officers went about among\r\nthe people endeavouring to compel them to forego a liberty which had\r\nbeen secured to them under the Great Seal of France. In vain were\r\ndeputations sent from Bordeaux and Gascony beseeching the king to be\r\nfaithful to his promise. The petitioners were sent back with an answer\r\nurging the people to submit to exactions which were required for the\r\ndefence of the country. The citizens of Bordeaux were greatly\r\ndiscontented, and an embassy, headed by the Sieur de l’Esparre, was sent\r\nover to the King of England to offer him the allegiance of the lost\r\nprovinces once more, on his sending a sufficient fleet and army to their\r\nrescue. The proposal being laid before a meeting of the English Council,\r\nwas of course most readily agreed to; and it was arranged that a fleet,\r\nunder the command of the Earl of Shrewsbury, should sail for the Garonne\r\nin October. On the 18th of that month the earl accordingly embarked with\r\na body of 4000 or 5000 soldiers. The French army having withdrawn, he\r\neasily obtained possession of Bordeaux, and sent its captain, Oliver de\r\nCoëtivy, a prisoner into England. Other towns then readily opened their\r\ngates to the invaders, of which one of the principal was Castillon in\r\nPerigord; and very soon, in spite of the opposition of their French\r\ngovernors, the greater part of the lost provinces had put themselves\r\nagain under the protection of the English.[122-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 122-1: Basin, i. 258-261. Leclerq (in Petitot’s\r\n    Collection), 37-38.]\r\n\r\n  [[sent its captain, Oliver de Coëtivy\r\n  _spelling unchanged: expected form “Olivier”_]]\r\n\r\nThe suddenness with which these things were done seems for a time to\r\nhave disconcerted the French king. Winter was now coming on, and\r\nprobably nothing effective could be done for some time, so Charles lay\r\nmaturing his plans in silence. As he surveyed the position at leisure,\r\nhe probably found that any further efforts of the invaders could be\r\nchecked with tolerable facility. France still retained possession of the\r\ntwo little towns of Bourges and Blaye, which we have already mentioned\r\nas being the keys of Bordeaux, and also of various other strong places\r\nin which he had been careful to leave considerable garrisons. [Sidenote:\r\nA.D. 1453.] It was therefore the beginning of June in the following year\r\nbefore he took any active steps to expel the enemy from their conquests.\r\nHe then marched southwards from Lusignan, near Poitiers, and laid siege\r\nto Chalais in Perigord, on the borders of Saintonge. In the space of\r\nfive days it was taken by assault. Out of a garrison of 160 men no less\r\nthan half were cut to pieces. The other half took refuge in a tower\r\nwhere they still held out for a time in the vain hope of succours, till\r\nat last they were compelled to surrender unconditionally. Of the\r\nprisoners taken, such as were of English birth were ransomed; but as for\r\nthose who were Gascons, as they had sworn fealty to Charles and departed\r\nfrom their allegiance, they were all beheaded. After this, one or two\r\nother ill-defended places fell into the hands of the French. On the 14th\r\nJuly siege was laid to Castillon on the Dordogne, a position which when\r\nwon gave the French free navigation into the Gironde. The besieging army\r\nwas furnished with the most perfect mechanism of war that the skill or\r\nscience of that age could supply. It had a train of artillery, with no\r\nless than 700 gunners, under the conduct of two able engineers of Paris,\r\nthe brothers Bureau. The place was thoroughly closed in, when\r\nShrewsbury, hearing of the danger in which it stood, came with haste out\r\nof Bordeaux with a body of 800 or 1000 horse, followed shortly after by\r\n4000 or 5000 foot.[123-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 123-1: Basin, i. 261-4. Leclerq, 39-41. Matt. de Coussy,\r\n    121.]\r\n\r\nAt daybreak on the 17th, the earl came suddenly upon the besiegers, and\r\nsucceeded without difficulty in thoroughly defeating a body of archers,\r\nwho had been posted at an abbey outside the town. This detachment being\r\ncompletely taken by surprise, was obliged to save itself by flight, and\r\nafter a little skirmishing, in which some 80 or 100 men were slain on\r\nboth sides, the greater number of the Frenchmen succeeded in gaining a\r\npark in which the main body of the besiegers had entrenched themselves.\r\nFurther pursuit being now unnecessary, the English returned to the\r\nabbey, where they were able to refresh themselves with a quantity of\r\nvictuals which the French had left behind them. ‘And because the said\r\nskirmish,’ writes the French chronicler De Coussy, ‘had been begun and\r\nwas done so early that as yet Talbot had not heard mass, his chaplain\r\nprepared himself to sing it there; and for this purpose the altar and\r\nornaments were got ready.’ But this devout intention the earl presently\r\nabandoned; for a cloud of dust was seen in the distance, and it was\r\nreported to him that even the main body of the French were rapidly\r\nretreating. Immediately the earl was again on horseback, and as he left\r\nthe abbey he was heard to say, ‘I will hear no mass to-day till I have\r\noverthrown the company of Frenchmen in the park before me.’[123-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 123-2: Basin, i. 264-5. De Coussy, 122.]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it turned out that the report of the retreat of the\r\nFrench was utterly unfounded. The cloud of dust had been raised by a\r\nbody of horses which they had sent out of the camp to graze. The French\r\narmy remained in its position, with artillery drawn up, ready to meet\r\nthe earl on his advance. The English, nevertheless, came on with their\r\nusual shout, ‘A Talbot! A Talbot! St. George!’ and while their foremost\r\nmen just succeeded for an instant in planting their standard on the\r\nbarrier of the French lines, they were mowed down behind by the\r\nformidable fire of the French artillery. Against this all valour was\r\nfruitless; about 500 or 600 English lay dead in front; and the French,\r\nopening the barrier of their park, rushed out and fought with their\r\nopponents hand to hand. For a while the conflict was still maintained,\r\nwith great valour on both sides; but the superior numbers of the French,\r\nand the advantage they had already gained by their artillery, left very\r\nlittle doubt about the issue. After about 4000 Englishmen had been slain\r\nin the hand-to-hand encounter, the remainder fled or were made\r\nprisoners. Some were able to withdraw into the town and join themselves\r\nto the besieged garrison; others fled through the woods and across the\r\nriver, in which a number of the fugitives were drowned. [Sidenote:\r\nDefeat and death of Talbot.] In the end the body of the veteran Talbot\r\nwas found dead upon the field, covered with wounds upon the limbs, and a\r\ngreat gash across the face.[124-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 124-1: De Coussy, 124.]\r\n\r\nSo fell the aged warrior, whose mere name had long been a terror to\r\nEngland’s enemies. By the confession of a French historian, who hardly\r\nseems to feel it a disgrace to his countrymen, the archers, when they\r\nclosed around him, distinctly refused to spare his life, so vindictively\r\neager were they to despatch him with a multitude of wounds.[124-2] Yet\r\nit must be owned that in this action he courted his own death, and\r\nrisked the destruction of a gallant army. For though he was led to the\r\ncombat by a false report, he was certainly under no necessity of\r\nengaging the enemy when he had discovered his mistake, and he was\r\nstrongly dissuaded from doing so by Thomas Everingham.[124-3] But his\r\nown natural impetuosity, inflamed probably still more by the\r\nunreasonable taunts of the men of Bordeaux, who, it seems, were\r\ndissatisfied that no earlier attempt had been made to resist the advance\r\nof the French king into Guienne,[124-4] induced him to stake everything\r\non the issue of a most desperate and unequal conflict.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 124-2: Basin, i. 267-8.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 124-3: _Ibid._ 265.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 124-4: De Coussy, 122.]\r\n\r\nWith him there also died upon the field his eldest son, Lord Lisle, his\r\nillegitimate son, Henry Talbot, Sir Edward Hull, and thirty other\r\nknights of England. About double that number were taken prisoners, the\r\nmost notable of whom was John Paston’s old persecutor, the Lord\r\nMoleyns.[125-1] Never had the English arms experienced such a disastrous\r\noverthrow.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 125-1: J. Chartier, 265; Berry, 469.]\r\n\r\nThe Gascons now gave up their cause as altogether hopeless. A fresh army\r\nhad lately marched into their country, and was laying siege to several\r\nplaces at once towards the east of Bordeaux, so that it was manifest\r\nthat city would soon be shut in by the royal forces. Castillon was no\r\nlonger able to hold out. It surrendered on the second day after Talbot’s\r\ndeath. About the same time Charles in person laid siege to Cadillac, one\r\nof the most important places in the neighbourhood, protected by a strong\r\ncastle. The town was speedily carried by assault, and a few weeks later\r\nthe castle was also taken. Other places in like manner came once more\r\ninto the power of the French king. At Fronsac an English garrison\r\ncapitulated and was allowed to leave the country, each soldier bearing\r\nin his hand a baton till he reached the seaside. Very soon Bordeaux was\r\nthe only place that held out; nor was the defence even of this last\r\nstronghold very long protracted. Its surrender was delayed for a time\r\nonly in consequence of the severity of the conditions on which Charles\r\nat first insisted; but a sickness which began to ravage his camp at\r\nlength inclined him to clemency. On the 17th of October the city\r\nsubmitted to Charles, the inhabitants engaging to renew their oaths of\r\nallegiance, and the English having leave to return in their own ships to\r\nEngland. To secure himself against their future return, or any fresh\r\nrebellion of the citizens, Charles caused to be built and garrisoned, at\r\nthe expense of the latter, two strong towers, which were still standing\r\nat the beginning of the last century. Thus was Gascony finally lost to\r\nthe Crown of England.\r\n\r\nWe must now return to the domestic affairs of the kingdom. Matters had\r\nbeen hung up, as it were, in a state of unstable equilibrium ever since\r\nGood Friday 1452. The political amnesty, proceeding, as it did, from the\r\nking’s own heart, and removing every stain of disloyalty from those who\r\nhad laboured most to change his policy, helped, in all probability, to\r\nkeep up a precarious state of tranquillity much longer than it could\r\notherwise have been preserved. The danger of Calais, too, had passed\r\naway for the time, although it was always recurring at intervals so long\r\nas Henry VI. was king. So that, perhaps, during the latter part of the\r\nyear 1452, the country was in as quiet a state as could reasonably have\r\nbeen expected. At least, the absence of information to the contrary may\r\nbe our warrant for so believing. [Sidenote: A.D. 1453.] But the new year\r\nhad no sooner opened than evidences of disaffection began to be\r\nperceived. [Sidenote: Robert Poynings.] On the 2nd of January Robert\r\nPoynings--the same who had taken a leading part in Cade’s rebellion, and\r\nhad, it will be remembered, saved the life of one of Sir John Fastolf’s\r\nservants from the violence of the insurgents--called together an\r\nassembly of people at Southwark, many of whom were outlaws. What his\r\nobject was we have no distinct evidence to show. He had received the\r\nking’s general pardon for the part he took in the movement under Cade;\r\nbut he had been obliged to enter into a recognisance of £2000, and\r\nfind six sureties of £200 each, for his good behaviour; so that he, of\r\nall men, had best cause to beware of laying himself open to any new\r\nsuspicion of disloyalty. Yet it appears he not only did so by this\r\nmeeting at Southwark, but that immediately afterwards he confederated\r\nwith one Thomas Bigg of Lambeth, who had been one of Cade’s petty\r\ncaptains, and having met with him and about thirty others at Westerham\r\nin Kent, tried to stir up a new rising in the former seat of rebellion.\r\nFrom Kent he further proceeded into Sussex, and sent letters to two\r\npersons who had been indicted of treason, urging them to come and meet\r\nhim at Southwark on the last day of February; ‘at which time and place,’\r\nsays the Parliament Roll, ‘the same Robert Poynings gave them money,\r\nthanking them heartily of their good will and disposition that they were\r\nof unto him in time past, praying them to continue their good will, and\r\nto be ready and come to him at such time as he should give them\r\nwarning.’[126-1] Altogether it would appear from the record of the\r\ncharge itself that nothing very serious came of this display of\r\ndisaffection on the part of Poynings; but it must at least be noted as a\r\nsymptom of the times.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 126-1: _Rolls of Parl._ v. 396. _See_ also the pardon\r\n    granted to him five years later. _Patent Roll_, 36 Hen. VI. m.\r\n    12.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Parliament.] Soon after this a Parliament was called. The\r\nCrown was in need of money; but Somerset did not dare to convoke the\r\nlegislature at Westminster. It met in the refectory of the abbey of\r\nReading on the 6th of March. In the absence of the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, Cardinal Kemp, who was Chancellor, the Bishop of\r\nLincoln[127-1] opened the proceedings by a speech on behalf of the king,\r\ndeclaring the causes of their being summoned; which were merely stated\r\nto be, in general terms, for the good government of the kingdom and for\r\nits outward defence. The necessity of sending reinforcements into\r\nGascony was not mentioned, and apparently was not thought of; for up to\r\nthis time the success of Shrewsbury had been uninterrupted, and the\r\nFrench king had not yet begun his southward march. The Commons elected\r\none Thomas Thorpe as their Speaker, and presented him to the king on the\r\n8th. Within three weeks they voted a tenth and fifteenth, a subsidy of\r\ntonnage and poundage, a subsidy on wools, hides, and woolfells, and a\r\ncapitation tax on aliens,--all these, except the tenth and fifteenth, to\r\nbe levied for the term of the king’s natural life. They also ordained\r\nthat every county, city, and town should be charged to raise its quota\r\ntowards the levying of a body of 20,000 archers within four months. For\r\nthese important services they received the thanks of the king,\r\ncommunicated to them by the Chancellor, and were immediately prorogued\r\nover Easter, to sit at Westminster on the 25th of April.[127-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 127-1: Called William, Bishop of Lincoln, on the _Rolls\r\n    of Parliament_, but his name was John Chedworth.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 127-2: _Rolls of Parl._ v. 227-31.]\r\n\r\nOn their reassembling there, they proceeded to arrange the proportion of\r\nthe number of archers which should be raised in each county, and the\r\nmeans by which they were to be levied. The Commons, however, were\r\nrelieved of the charge of providing 7000 men of the number formerly\r\nagreed to, as 3000 were to be charged upon the Lords and 3000 more on\r\nWales and the county palatine of Cheshire, while an additional thousand\r\nwas remitted by the king, probably as the just proportion to be levied\r\nout of his own household. For the remaining 13,000, the quota of each\r\ncounty was then determined. But soon afterwards it was found that the\r\nneed of such a levy was not so urgent as had at first been supposed, and\r\nthe actual raising of the men was respited for two years, provided that\r\nno emergency arose requiring earlier need of their services.[128-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 128-1: _Rolls of Parl._ v. 231-3.]\r\n\r\nThe possibility of their being required in Gascony after the success of\r\nthe Earl of Shrewsbury in the preceding year, seems no more to have\r\noccurred to the Government, than the thought of sending them to\r\nConstantinople, where possibly, had the fact been known, they might at\r\nthis very time have done something to prevent that ancient city from\r\nfalling into the hands of the Turks. For it was in this very year, and\r\nwhile these things occupied the attention of the English Parliament,\r\nthat the long decaying Eastern Empire was finally extinguished by the\r\nfall of its metropolis.\r\n\r\nAfter this, some new Acts were passed touching the pay of the garrison\r\nat Calais, and for the making of jetties and other much-needed repairs\r\nthere. For these purposes large sums of money were required, and the\r\nmode in which they were to be provided gives us a remarkable insight\r\ninto the state of the exchequer. To the Duke of Somerset, as Captain of\r\nCalais, there was owing a sum of £21,648, 10s., for the wages of himself\r\nand his suite since the date of his appointment; and on the duke’s own\r\npetition, an Act was passed enabling him to be paid, not immediately,\r\nbut after his predecessor, Humphrey, Duke of Buckingham, should have\r\nreceived all that was due to him in a like capacity.[128-2] The pay of\r\nthe officers of Calais, it would thus appear, but that it seems to have\r\nbeen discharged by the Captain for the time being out of his own\r\nresources, must at this time have been more than two years in arrear. If\r\nsuch was the state of matters, we gain some light on the causes which\r\ninduced Somerset, after his loss of Normandy, to add to his unpopularity\r\nby accepting a post of so much responsibility as the Captainship of\r\nCalais. He was one of the few men in England whose wealth was such that\r\nhe could afford to wait for his money; and he was too responsible for\r\nthe rotten government which had led to such financial results to give\r\nany other man a post in which he would certainly have found cause of\r\ndissatisfaction.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 128-2: _Ibid._ v. 233.]\r\n\r\nIt was necessary, however, to provide ready money for the repairs and\r\nthe wages of the garrison from this time, and it was accordingly enacted\r\nthat a half of the fifteenth and tenth already voted should be\r\nimmediately applied to the one object, and a certain proportion of the\r\nsubsidy on wools to the other. At the same time a new vote of half a\r\nfifteenth and tenth additional was found necessary to meet the\r\nextraordinary expenditure, and was granted on the 2nd of July.[129-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 129-1: _Rolls of Parl._ v. 234-6.]\r\n\r\nThis grant being announced by the Speaker to the king, who was then\r\nsitting in Parliament, Henry thanked the Commons with his own mouth, and\r\nthen commissioned the chancellor, Cardinal Kemp, to prorogue the\r\nassembly; alleging as his reasons the consideration due to the zeal and\r\nattendance of the Commons, and the king’s own intention of visiting\r\ndifferent parts of his kingdom for the suppression of various\r\nmalpractices. ‘The king, also,’ he added, ‘understood that there were\r\ndivers petitions exhibited in the present Parliament to which no answer\r\nhad yet been returned, and which would require greater deliberation and\r\nleisure than could now conveniently be afforded, seeing that the autumn\r\nseason was at hand, in which the Lords were at liberty to devote\r\nthemselves to hunting and sport, and the Commons to the gathering in of\r\ntheir harvests.’ As these weighty matters, whatever they were, required\r\ntoo much consideration to be disposed of before harvest-time, we might\r\nperhaps have expected an earlier day to be fixed for the reassembling of\r\nthe legislature than that which was actually then announced. Perhaps,\r\nalso, we might have expected that as the Parliament had returned to\r\nWestminster, it would have been ordered to meet there again when it\r\nrenewed its sittings. But the king, or his counsellors, were of a\r\ndifferent opinion; and the Parliament was ordered to meet again on the\r\n12th of November at Reading.\r\n\r\nLong before that day came, calamities of no ordinary kind had overtaken\r\nboth king and nation. About the beginning of August,[130-1] news must\r\nhave come to England of the defeat and death of the Earl of Shrewsbury;\r\nand Somerset at last was quickened into action when it was too late.\r\nGreat preparations were made for sending an army into Guienne, when\r\nGuienne was already all but entirely lost. It is true the Government\r\nwere aware of the danger in which Talbot stood for want of succours, at\r\nleast as early as the 14th of July; even then they were endeavouring to\r\nraise money by way of loan, and to arrest ships and sailors. But it is\r\nevident that they had slept too long in false security, and when they\r\nwere for the first time thoroughly awake to the danger, the disaster was\r\nso near at hand that it could not possibly have been averted.[130-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 130-1: It appears not to have been known on the 4th of\r\n    August. Stevenson’s _Wars_, ii. 487-8.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 130-2: Nicolas’s _Privy Council Proceedings_, vi. 151-4,\r\n    155-7. Stevenson’s _Wars_, ii. 481-92.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King’s Prostration_\r\n\r\nWhether it was in any degree owing to this national calamity,--in which\r\ncase, the impression made by the event may well have been deepened by\r\nthe knowledge that it was attributed to the remissness of Somerset,--or\r\nwhether it was due entirely to physical or other causes quite\r\nunconnected with public affairs, [Sidenote: The king falls ill.] in\r\nAugust the king fell ill at Clarendon, and began to exhibit symptoms of\r\nmental derangement.[130-3] Two months later an event occurred in which,\r\nunder other circumstances, he could not but have felt a lively interest.\r\nAfter eight years of married life, the queen for the first time bore him\r\na child. It was a son and received the name of Edward; but for a long\r\ntime afterwards the father knew nothing of the event. So entirely were\r\nhis mental faculties in abeyance, that it was found impossible to\r\ncommunicate to him the news. The affairs of his kingdom and those of his\r\nfamily were for the time equally beyond his comprehension.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 130-3: W. Worc. In an almanac of that time I find the\r\n    following note, which dates the beginning of the king’s illness on\r\n    the 10th of August:--‘In nocte S. Laurentii Rex infirmatur et\r\n    continuavit usque ad Circumcisionem Anni 1455, in p. . . .’ (?) (a\r\n    word unintelligible at the end). MS. Reg. 13, C. 1.]\r\n\r\n  [[began to exhibit symptoms of mental derangement\r\n  _text reads “symptons”_]]\r\n\r\nThe failure of royalty to perform any of its functions, however weakly\r\nthey might have been performed before, was a crisis that had not\r\noccurred till now. A heavier responsibility lay with Somerset and the\r\nCouncil, who could not expect that acts done by their own authority\r\nwould meet with the same respect and recognition as those for which they\r\nhad been able to plead the direct sanction of their sovereign. And now\r\nthey had to deal with a factious world, in which feuds between powerful\r\nfamilies had already begun to kindle a dangerous conflagration. In the\r\nmonth of August, probably of the year before this, Lord Thomas Nevill,\r\na son of the Earl of Salisbury, married a niece of Lord Cromwell at\r\nTattersall in Lincolnshire. After the wedding the earl returned into\r\nYorkshire, when, having reached the neighbourhood of York, some\r\ndisturbance arose between his retainers and those of Lord Egremont, son\r\nof the Earl of Northumberland.[131-1] As to the cause of the dispute we\r\nare left entirely ignorant; but it grew into a serious quarrel between\r\nthe Nevills and the Percys. The chief maintainers of the feud were, on\r\nthe one side, Sir John Nevill, a younger son of the Earl of Salisbury,\r\nand on the other Lord Egremont. Both parties were repeatedly summoned to\r\nlay their grievances before the Council; but the most peremptory letters\r\nand mandates had hitherto been ineffectual. Illegal gatherings of people\r\non either side continued in spite of every prohibition; and the whole\r\nnorth of England seems to have been kept in continual disorder.[131-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 131-1: W. Worc.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 131-2: Nicolas’s _Privy Council Proceedings_, vi. 140-2,\r\n    147-9, 154-5.]\r\n\r\nThe case was not likely to be improved when the source of all legal\r\nauthority was paralysed. And yet so bad was the state of matters before,\r\nthat the king’s illness, instead of being an aggravation of the evil,\r\npositively brought with it some perceptible relief. The Council were no\r\nlonger able to avoid calling in the aid of one whose capacity to rule\r\nwas as indisputable as his birth and rank. A Great Council was summoned\r\nfor the express purpose of promoting ‘rest and union betwixt the lords\r\nof this land’; and according to the usage in such cases, every peer of\r\nthe realm had notice to attend. Gladly, no doubt, would Somerset have\r\nomitted to send such notice to his rival; and it seems actually to have\r\nbeen the case that no summons was at first sent to the Duke of York. But\r\nafterwards the error was rectified, and York being duly summoned, came\r\nup to Westminster and took his seat at the Council-table[132-1] on the\r\n21st of November. Before taking part in the proceedings, however, he\r\naddressed himself to the lords then assembled, declaring how he had come\r\nup in obedience to a writ of privy seal, and was ready to offer his best\r\nservices to the king; but as a previous order had been issued, by what\r\nauthority he could not say, to certain old councillors to forbear from\r\nattending the king’s councils in future, he required that any such\r\nprohibition might be removed. This was unanimously agreed to, and the\r\ngovernment of England was at once restored to a free and healthy\r\ncondition.[132-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 132-1: Nicolas’s _Privy Council Proceedings_, vi.\r\n    163-5.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 132-2: _Patent Roll_, 32 Hen. VI. m. 20. _See_ Appendix\r\n    to this Introduction.]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Somerset was not present at this meeting of the Council. He\r\ndoubtless saw too clearly the storm gathering against him. To his former\r\nresponsibility for the loss of Normandy was now added further\r\nresponsibility for the loss of Guienne. The accusations against him were\r\naccordingly renewed; but they were taken up this time, not by York but\r\nby the Duke of Norfolk. [Sidenote: Norfolk accuses Somerset.] A set of\r\narticles of impeachment was drawn up by the latter, to which Somerset\r\nmade some reply, and was answered again by Norfolk. The accuser then\r\npressed the matter further, urging that the loss of Normandy and of\r\nGuienne should be made a subject of criminal inquiry according to the\r\nlaws of France; and that other misdemeanours charged upon him should be\r\ninvestigated according to the modes of procedure in England. Finally,\r\nlest his petition should be refused by the Council, Norfolk desired that\r\nit might be exemplified under the king’s Great Seal, protesting that he\r\nfelt it necessary, for his own credit, that what he had done in the\r\nmatter should be known as widely as possible.[132-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 132-3: No. 230.]\r\n\r\nIn the end it was determined that the Duke of Somerset should be\r\narrested and committed to the Tower. This resolution was carried into\r\neffect a little before Christmas, and the different lords retired during\r\nthe festive season to their own country quarters. But all who had given\r\ntheir votes against Somerset knew well that they stood in considerable\r\ndanger. The battle that he had lost would have to be fought over again\r\nwith the queen, who now put in a claim to be intrusted with the entire\r\ngovernment of the kingdom. Every man of Somerset’s party got his\r\nretainers in readiness, and while other lords were out of town, the\r\nharbinger of the Duke of Somerset secured for his company all the\r\nlodgings that were to be got in Thames Street, Mark Lane, St.\r\nKatherine’s, and the neighbourhood of the Tower. The Duke of Norfolk was\r\nwarned by a faithful servant to beware of parties in ambush on his way\r\nto London. Everything clearly showed that the faction which had been\r\ndispossessed of power had sanguine hopes of reinstating themselves at an\r\nearly opportunity.[133-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 133-1: No. 235.]\r\n\r\nAnd this, it is probable, they might have done with the greatest\r\npossible ease, were it not that the king’s loss of his faculties was so\r\ncomplete and absolute that it was impossible, by any means whatever, to\r\nobtain a semblance of acting upon his authority. [Sidenote: A.D. 1454.]\r\nAbout New Year’s Day, when the new-born prince was conveyed to Windsor,\r\nthe Duke of Buckingham took the child in his arms and presented him to\r\nthe king, beseeching him to give him a father’s blessing. Henry returned\r\nno answer. [Sidenote: The king and his child.] The duke remained some\r\ntime with the child in the king’s presence, but could not extract from\r\nhim the slightest sign of intelligence. The queen then came in, and\r\ntaking the infant in her arms, presented him to his father, with the\r\nsame request that the duke had made before her. But all their efforts\r\nwere in vain; the king continued dumb, and showed not the slightest\r\nperception of what they were doing, except that for one moment only he\r\nlooked upon the babe, and then cast down his eyes again.[133-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 133-2: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\nThere were no hopes, therefore, that the king himself would interfere in\r\nany way to protect his favourites in the Council. [Sidenote: Every man\r\nlooks to himself.] Every man felt it necessary to see to his own\r\nsecurity. The Lord Chancellor himself, Cardinal Kemp, ‘commanded all his\r\nservants to be ready, with bow and arrows, sword and buckler, crossbows,\r\nand all other habiliments of war, to await upon the safeguard of his\r\nperson.’ The Duke of Buckingham caused to be made ‘2000 bends with\r\nknots--to what intent,’ said a cautious observer, ‘men may construe as\r\ntheir wits will give them.’ Further from the court, of course, the old\r\ndisturbances were increased. ‘The Duke of Exeter, in his own person,\r\nhath been at Tuxforth beside Doncaster, in the north country, and there\r\nthe Lord Egremont met him, and the two be sworn together, and the duke\r\nis come home again.’ The Earl of Wiltshire and the Lord Bonvile made\r\nproclamations in Somersetshire, offering sixpence a day to every man\r\nthat would serve them; and these two noblemen, along with the Lords\r\nBeaumont, Poynings, Clifford, and Egremont, were preparing to come up to\r\nLondon each with as strong a body of followers as he could possibly\r\nmuster.[134-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 134-1: No. 235.]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of York and his friends on their side did the same; and it was\r\nhigh time they should, otherwise the machinations of Somerset would\r\ncertainly have been their ruin. The latter had spies in every great\r\nhousehold, who reported to him everything that could be construed to the\r\ndisadvantage of his opponents. [Sidenote: The Duke of York and Thorpe.]\r\nAmong York’s private enemies, moreover, was Thomas Thorpe, Speaker of\r\nthe House of Commons, who was also a Baron of the Exchequer. In the\r\nformer capacity his functions had been for some time suspended; for\r\nParliament, which had been prorogued to the 12th November at Reading,\r\nonly met on that day to be prorogued again to the 11th February, in\r\nconsequence of the mortality which prevailed in the town. Meanwhile, in\r\nMichaelmas term, the Duke of York took an action of trespass against him\r\nin his own Court of Exchequer, and a jury had awarded damages to the\r\namount of £1000. On this judgment was given that he should be committed\r\nto the Fleet till the damages were paid, and in the Fleet the Speaker\r\naccordingly remained till the next meeting of Parliament.[135-1] In his\r\nconfinement he was now busily employed in drawing up a bill of articles\r\nagainst the Duke of York, which doubtless, with the aid of a little\r\nfavour at Court, would have been highly serviceable to the cause of\r\nSomerset.[135-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 135-1: _Rolls of Parl._ v. 238-9.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 135-2: No. 235.]\r\n\r\nThe legal proceedings of which Thorpe was a victim appear doubtless to\r\nhave been connected with party politics. His son and heir, Roger Thorpe,\r\nat the beginning of the reign of Henry VII. procured an Act of\r\nParliament in his favour, showing that both he and his father had\r\nsuffered injustice in the cause of the House of Lancaster, and that the\r\nDuke of York’s action of trespass against his father was owing to his\r\nhaving arrested, at the king’s command, ‘certain harness and other\r\nhabiliments of war of the said duke’s.’[135-3] No doubt this must have\r\nbeen the case, but was the king’s command constitutional? Or was it,\r\nperhaps, only the command of Somerset given in the king’s name? An agent\r\nhad no right to obey an unconstitutional order.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 135-3: _Rolls of Parl._ vi. 295.]\r\n\r\nAbout the 25th of January the Duke of York was expected in London,\r\naccompanied by a select body of men of his household retinue. With him\r\ncame his son, the Earl of March, at this time not quite twelve years\r\nold; to whom, nevertheless, a separate household had already been\r\nassigned by his father, and consequently another company marched in the\r\nname of the Earl of March. These, however, were sent forward a little in\r\nadvance. Along with the Duke of York there also came up, or was expected\r\nto come, his powerful friend the Earl of Warwick, who, besides the\r\nretinue by which he was attended, was to have a thousand men awaiting\r\nhis arrival in London. Even these noblemen and their companies formed a\r\nmost powerful confederacy. But there were two other great personages\r\nbesides who travelled with them on the same road, whose sympathy and\r\nco-operation with York at this time no reader would have conjectured.\r\nThe king’s two half-brothers, the Earls of Richmond and Pembroke, were\r\nexpected to reach London in the duke’s company; and they, too, had\r\nwisely taken with them a good number of followers, for, notwithstanding\r\ntheir relation to the Crown, it was thought not unlikely that they would\r\nbe arrested on their arrival.[136-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 136-1: No. 235.]\r\n\r\nIn short, the continuance of the king’s infirmity had now rendered it\r\nclear to every man that unless the Council were willing to comply with\r\nthe Queen’s demands, and yield up to her the uncontrolled management of\r\npublic affairs, the government of the kingdom must be placed in the\r\nhands of the Duke of York. And yet some little time was necessarily\r\nallowed to pass before any special powers could be intrusted to him.\r\nParliament was not to sit again till the 11th February, and Reading was\r\nstill the place where it was appointed to assemble. The Earl of\r\nWorcester, who filled the office of Lord Treasurer, was commissioned to\r\ngo down to Reading, and cause it to adjourn from the 11th to the 14th of\r\nthe month, to meet that day at Westminster. Meanwhile a commission was\r\ngranted to the Duke of York to act as the king’s lieutenant on its\r\nreassembling.[136-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 136-2: _Rolls of Parl._ v. 238-9.]\r\n\r\n  [[on its reassembling.[136-2] _final . missing_]]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Parliament and the Speaker.] On the 14th, accordingly, the\r\nHouses met in the royal palace of Westminster; but the Commons were\r\nwithout a Speaker, and another of their members, by name Walter Rayle,\r\nwas also undergoing imprisonment, from what cause does not appear. The\r\nCommons, therefore, before proceeding to business, demanded of the King\r\nand the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, that their ancient privileges\r\nshould be respected, and their Speaker and the other member liberated.\r\nThe case was taken into consideration by the Peers on the following day,\r\nwhen it was explained by the Duke of York’s counsel that the Speaker had\r\na few months before gone to the house of Robert Nevill, Bishop of\r\nDurham, and there taken away certain goods and chattels belonging to the\r\nduke against his will; that for this he had been prosecuted in the Court\r\nof Exchequer, as it was a privilege of that court that its officers in\r\nsuch cases should not be sued before any other tribunal; that a jury had\r\nfound him guilty of trespass, and awarded to the duke damages of £1000\r\nand £10 costs. Speaker Thorpe had accordingly been committed to the\r\nFleet for the fine due to the king. The proceedings against him had not\r\nbeen taken during the sitting of Parliament, and it was urged that if he\r\nshould be released by privilege of Parliament a great wrong would be\r\ndone to the duke. It was a delicate question of constitutional law, and\r\nthe Lords desired to have the opinion of the judges. But the chief\r\njustices, after consultation with their brethren, answered, in the name\r\nof the whole body, that it was beyond their province to determine\r\nmatters concerning the privilege of Parliament; ‘for this high court of\r\nParliament,’ they said, ‘is so high and mighty in his nature that it may\r\nmake law, and that that is law it may make no law; and the determination\r\nand knowledge of the privilege belongeth to the Lords of the Parliament,\r\nand not to the Justices.’ Nevertheless, as to the accustomed mode of\r\nprocedure in the lower courts, the Judges remarked that in ordinary\r\ncases of arrest a prisoner was frequently liberated on a writ of\r\n_supersedeas_ to enable him to attend the Parliament; but no general\r\nwrit of _supersedeas_, to surcease all processes, could be allowed; ‘for\r\nif there should be, it should seem that this high court of Parliament,\r\nthat ministereth all justice and equity, should let the process of the\r\ncommon law, and so it should put the party complainant without remedy,\r\nfor so much as actions at the common law be not determined in this high\r\ncourt of Parliament.’[137-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 137-1: _Rolls of Parl._ v. 239-40.]\r\n\r\nFrom this carefully considered reply it was clear to the Lords that they\r\nwere at least nowise bound to interfere in behalf of the imprisoned\r\nSpeaker, unless they considered the liberties of Parliament likely to be\r\nprejudiced by the circumstances of his particular case. It was\r\naccordingly decided that he should remain in prison, and that the\r\nCommons should be directed to choose another Speaker. This they did on\r\nthe following day, and presented Sir Thomas Charleton to the Lord\r\nChancellor as their new representative; who being accepted by that\r\nfunctionary in the name of the king, both Houses at once proceeded to\r\nbusiness.[137-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 137-2: _Ibid._ 240.]\r\n\r\nA month later the Commons came before the Duke of York, as the king’s\r\nlieutenant, with two very urgent petitions. [Sidenote: Defence of\r\nCalais.] The first related to the defence of Calais and the safeguard of\r\nthe sea. Notwithstanding the very liberal grants which had already been\r\nvoted by this Parliament, Calais was still in danger, and the sea was\r\nstill very insufficiently protected; insomuch that the Lord Chancellor\r\nhad told the House of Commons £40,000 would be required to obviate very\r\nserious perils. The Commons were very naturally alarmed; a modern House\r\nof Commons would have been indignant also. They had in the preceding\r\nyear voted no less than £9300 for Calais, partly for repairs and partly\r\nfor making jetties, besides all the sums voted for the pay of the\r\ngarrison and the tonnage and poundage dues, which ought to have been\r\napplied to general purposes of defence. They therefore humbly petitioned\r\nto be excused from making any further grants; ‘for they cannot, may not,\r\nne dare not make any mo grants, considered the great poverty and penury\r\nthat be among the Commons of this land, for whom they be comen at this\r\ntime; and that this their excuse might be enacted in this high court of\r\nParliament.’ The money already voted was evidently conceived to be\r\nsomewhere, and was considered to be quite sufficient to do the work\r\nrequired; so the Commons were told in reply by my Lord Chancellor the\r\nCardinal, ‘that they should have good and comfortable answer, without\r\nany great delay or tarrying.’[138-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 138-1: _Rolls of Parl._ v. 240.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A council required.] The second petition was that ‘a sad and\r\nwise Council’ might be established, ‘of the right discreet and wise\r\nlords and other of this land, to whom all people might have recourse for\r\nministering justice, equity, and righteousness; whereof they have no\r\nknowledge as yet.’ The Duke of York was only the king’s lieutenant in\r\nParliament. With the assent of the Great Council he could prorogue or\r\ndissolve it and give the royal assent to any of its acts. But the\r\nbusiness of the nation imperatively required that some smaller body of\r\nstatesmen should be intrusted with more general powers. Even before the\r\nking’s illness the constitution of some such body had been promised to\r\nthe Parliament at Reading as a thing contemplated by the king\r\nhimself;[138-2] and it was now more necessary than ever. The only\r\nproblem was how to confer upon it an authority that could not be\r\ndisputed.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 138-2: _Ibid._ 241.]\r\n\r\nBut while the Lords are taking this point into consideration, we invite\r\nthe reader’s attention to a piece of private history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Thomas Denyes.] A few years before the date at which we have\r\nnow arrived, one Thomas Denyes, a trusted servant of the Earl of Oxford,\r\nseems to have caused his master some little inconvenience by falling in\r\nlove with a lady who resided in the neighbourhood of Norwich. We regret\r\nthat we cannot inform the reader who she was. All that we know is that\r\nher Christian name was Agnes, which was at that time popularly corrupted\r\ninto Anneys and frequently confounded with Anne, and that she was an\r\nacquaintance of John Paston’s. With John Paston, accordingly, the earl\r\nthought it best to communicate, and in doing so earned for himself the\r\nheartfelt gratitude of Denyes by one of those small but truly gracious\r\nacts which reveal to us better than anything else the secret of the\r\npower of the English aristocracy. The lady seems not to have given her\r\nadmirer any great encouragement in his suit. She had property of her own\r\nworth 500 marks, and could have had a husband in Norfolk with land of\r\n100 marks value, which was more than Denyes could offer her. But the\r\nEarl of Oxford requested John Paston to intercede with her in behalf of\r\nher wooer, promising her that if the marriage took effect the Earl would\r\nshow himself liberal to them both. He further offered, if it would be\r\nany satisfaction to her, to go himself into Norfolk and visit\r\nher.[139-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 139-1: Nos. 124, 240.]\r\n\r\nThis intercession was effectual, and the lady became the wife of Thomas\r\nDenyes. It was a triumph of love and ambition to a poor dependant on a\r\ngreat earl. But with increase of wealth, as others have found in all\r\nages, Denyes experienced an increase of anxieties and of business also.\r\nA suit in Chancery was commenced against him and his wife by a gentleman\r\nof the name of Ingham, who considered himself to have a claim on the\r\nlady’s property for a considerable sum of money. Ingham’s son Walter was\r\nactive in procuring the _subpœna_. But Denyes, strong, as he believed,\r\nin a great lord’s favour, conceived a plan by which he might either\r\ninterrupt the suit or revenge it on the person of Walter Ingham. On the\r\n11th of January 1454--just about the time the queen and Buckingham were\r\nmaking those vain attempts to introduce his child to the notice of the\r\nunhappy king--when, consequently, it was still uncertain whether York or\r\nSomerset would have the rule, and when lawless persons all over the\r\ncountry must have felt that there was more than usual immunity for bad\r\ndeeds to be hoped for,--Thomas Denyes wrote a letter in the name of the\r\nEarl of Oxford to Walter Ingham, requiring his presence at the earl’s\r\nmansion at Wivenhoe, in Essex, on the 13th. This letter reached Ingham\r\nat Dunston, in Norfolk, and he at once set out in obedience to the\r\nsummons. [Sidenote: Walter Ingham waylaid.] But as he was nearing his\r\ndestination, on the 12th, he was waylaid by a party in ambush hired by\r\nDenyes, who beat him so severely upon the head, legs, and back that he\r\nwas maimed for life, and compelled to go on crutches for the rest of his\r\ndays. Ingham complained of the outrage to the Lord Chancellor, Cardinal\r\nKemp, who sent a sergeant-at-arms to arrest Denyes at Lincoln’s Inn; but\r\nhe at first refused to obey the arrest. Shortly afterwards, however, he\r\nwas committed to the Fleet prison; and Ingham, with the favour of the\r\ncardinal and the Earl of Oxford, who utterly repudiated the act of his\r\ndependant, presented a petition to Parliament that he should not be\r\nadmitted to bail or mainprise until he had been tried for the outrage\r\nand all actions between him and Ingham had been fully discussed and\r\nsettled.[140-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 140-1: Nos. 238, 239.]\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Oxford seems to have been thoroughly incensed, and not\r\nwithout reason, against a servant who had so abused his trust. Cardinal\r\nKemp, as chancellor, was not less righteously indignant; and a bill was\r\nactually passed through the House of Peers in accordance with the prayer\r\nof Ingham’s petition. Yet it is difficult to understand why the\r\npunishment of the wrong committed was not left to the operation of\r\nordinary criminal law. The case, perhaps, affected too seriously the\r\nhonour of a nobleman, and the discretion to be allowed to a retainer.\r\nBut whatever may have been the cause, poor Denyes now becomes positively\r\nan object for compassion--all the more so because his chief feeling in\r\nthe matter was not a selfish one. [Sidenote: Denyes and his wife in\r\nprison.] Besides imprisoning Denyes himself in the Fleet, the cardinal\r\nand the Earl of Oxford threw his wife into the Counter, and afterwards\r\nsent her to Newgate, where she suffered the discomforts of a gaol apart\r\nfrom her husband, although she was then with child. ‘Which standeth too\r\nnigh mine heart,’ is the brief expression in which he conveys his\r\nfeelings to John Paston, while apparently he was expecting to hear that\r\nhis wife was either dead or prematurely delivered; for the treatment she\r\nhad met with brought on the pains of labour long before the right time\r\nhad come. Denyes, however, made friends with the warden of the Fleet\r\nprison, who contrived in some manner to make interest for her with her\r\ngaoler, so that afterwards she was rather better treated, and at last\r\nadmitted to bail.[141-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 141-1: No. 239.]\r\n\r\nPoor Denyes was in dread of still further evils arising out of the case\r\nwhen he wrote these facts to John Paston. The bill against him had\r\nalready passed through the Lords, and he was in fear that it might pass\r\nthrough the Commons also, which we afterwards learn that it did\r\nnot.[141-2] His adversary, moreover, was bent upon revenge; ‘for\r\nIngham,’ he said, ‘lieth, beside that, to take away my wife’s daughter\r\nout of Westminster,[141-3] to make an end of my wife if he can, and also\r\nto arrest my servants, that I dread that she nor I shall have no\r\ncreature to attend us ne help us; and such malice have I never heard of\r\nhere before. And it is told me that beside that they will despoil, if\r\nany good they can find of mine in Norwich or Norfolk, and imprison my\r\nservants there.’ All this he urgently implored Paston to prevent to the\r\nbest of his ability. And it must be said that John Paston, although he\r\nconsidered himself little bound to Denyes, except in so far as he had\r\npromoted his marriage at the Earl of Oxford’s solicitation, on this\r\noccasion stood his friend. He wrote a letter to the earl urgently\r\ninterceding for the unhappy wife; and though it seems probable the\r\nletter that he first wrote was not actually sent, we may fairly presume\r\nthat he either devised a second to the same effect, or used his\r\ninfluence otherwise to the same end. Certain it is that he made some\r\neffort for which Denyes was beyond measure grateful.[142-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 141-2: No. 244.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 141-3: Apparently Agnes Denyes had taken sanctuary at\r\n    Westminster before her imprisonment. The manner in which Denyes\r\n    here speaks of her daughter gives us reason to believe that she\r\n    was a widow before he married her.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 142-1: Nos. 240, 245.]\r\n\r\n‘The cardinal is dead and the king is relieved.’ Such were the last\r\nwords of a postscript which Denyes appended to his first melancholy\r\nletter, complaining of his own and his wife’s imprisonment. A rumour\r\napparently had been spread that the king’s health was beginning to\r\nimprove; for which, as we shall see, there was very little foundation.\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Cardinal Kemp.] But it was perfectly true that\r\nCardinal Kemp, Archbishop of Canterbury and Chancellor of England, was\r\ndead. Little as we know, beyond a few broad facts of his career, whereby\r\nto judge his real character and aims, it is certain that he was an\r\naccomplished statesman. A follower originally of Cardinal Beaufort,--the\r\nman who of all others could serve two masters, Rome and England, with\r\nthe least degree of repugnance, and of whom the best that can be said\r\nis, that he never scrupled to betray the former in what appeared to be\r\nthe interest of the latter,--Kemp was, perhaps, as honest a specimen of\r\nthe political churchman as an essentially bad system could produce. The\r\nclergy, however, were really needed as statesmen; few laymen had the\r\nability, learning, or education to enable them to do the essential work\r\nof the nation; and Kemp was one who had gained for himself, by his own\r\ntalents, the highest position to which a subject could aspire in\r\nEngland, not only in the realm but in the Church.\r\n\r\nThus, at a time when the functions of royalty itself were suspended, the\r\nchancellor, the official keeper of the king’s conscience, was suddenly\r\ntaken away; and in him England also lost her primate, always one of the\r\nmost important members of the Council. The formation of a governing\r\nCouncil was now more important than ever; but the most pressing\r\nquestions of all were the appointment of a new chancellor and of a new\r\narchbishop. Who was to take upon himself to nominate either the one or\r\nthe other? The queen’s modest claim to be invested with the functions of\r\nher husband had not been listened to by the Lords; but the powers as yet\r\nconferred upon the Duke of York were only to represent the king in\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nIt was upon the 19th of March that the Commons had pressed their\r\npetition for the establishment of a Council. Cardinal Kemp died on the\r\n22nd. [Sidenote: Deputation of Lords to the king.] On the 23rd the Lords\r\nappointed twelve of their number as a deputation, headed by Waynflete,\r\nBishop of Winchester, to ride to Windsor and endeavour, if possible, to\r\nlay the state of matters before the king. Their instructions were drawn\r\nup in six articles, but only two were to be communicated to the king if\r\nthey found him unable to pay attention to what was said. These two were\r\na mere assurance of anxiety to hear of his recovery, and that the Lords,\r\nunder the presidency of the duke as his lieutenant, were using their\r\nbest discretion in the affairs of the nation. If any response were made\r\nto these two articles, the deputation was then to tell him of the death\r\nof Cardinal Kemp, and ask to know his pleasure who should be the new\r\narchbishop and who should be appointed chancellor. They were to say that\r\nfor the security of the Great Seals (there were at this time no less\r\nthan three Great Seals used in the Chancery)[143-1] the Lords had caused\r\nthem to be produced in Parliament, and after being seen by all the Lords\r\nthey were enclosed in a coffer sealed by a number of the Peers present,\r\nand then laid up in the Treasury. Finally, they were to ask the king’s\r\nmind touching the establishment of a Council, telling him how much it\r\nwas desired by the Commons, and suggesting the names of certain Lords\r\nand persons whom it was thought desirable to appoint as Councillors. All\r\nthese matters, however, were to be communicated only to the king in the\r\nstrictest privacy.[143-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 143-1: Nicolas’s _Privy Council Proceedings_, vol. vi.\r\n    preface, pp. clxxviii.-ix.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 143-2: _Rolls of Parl._ 240-1.]\r\n\r\nThe deputation returned two days after with a report of the total\r\nfailure of their mission. They had waited on the king at Windsor just\r\nafter he had dined, but could get from him no answer nor sign that he\r\nunderstood their message. [Sidenote: The king’s imbecility.] The Bishop\r\nof Winchester then told the king that the Lords had not dined, and that\r\nafter they had they would wait on him again. After dinner accordingly\r\nthey were again with him, and tried all they could to elicit an answer;\r\nbut the king was speechless. They then proposed that he should go into\r\nanother room, and he was led between two men into his bedchamber. A\r\nthird and last effort was then made to rouse him by every expedient that\r\ncould be imagined; and when all else failed, a question was put to him\r\nwhich involved no more than a simple yes or no. Was it his Highness’s\r\npleasure that they should wait on him any longer? A long pause was\r\nallowed in the hope that any mere physical difficulty might be overcome.\r\nA faint nod, even a shake of the head, would have been regarded with\r\nsome degree of satisfaction. But it was all in vain. ‘They could have no\r\nanswer, word ne sign; and therefore with sorrowful hearts, came their\r\nway.’[144-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 144-1: _Rolls of Parl._ 241.]\r\n\r\nIt was now clear that the highest constitutional authority resided for\r\nthe time in the Lords Spiritual and Temporal. The reader, imbued with\r\nmodern notions of the power and prestige of the House of Commons, may\r\npossibly think that their votes, too, should have been consulted in the\r\nformation of a Government. Such a view, however, would be radically\r\nerroneous. The influence which the House of Commons has in later times\r\nacquired--an influence so great that, at times unhappily, Acts are even\r\npassed by Peers against their own sense of right and justice, in\r\ndeference to the will of the Lower Chamber--is a thing not directly\r\nrecognised by the constitution, but only due to the control of the\r\nnational purse-strings. Strictly speaking, the House of Commons is not a\r\nlegislative body at all, but only an engine for voting supplies. The\r\nPeers of the realm, in Parliament or out of Parliament, are, according\r\nto the constitution, the sovereign’s privileged advisers. A king may, no\r\ndoubt, at any time call to him what other councillors he pleases, and\r\nthe prerogative of the Lords may lie dormant for a very long period of\r\ntime; but the Peers of the realm have, individually or in a body,\r\na right to tender their advice upon affairs of state, which belongs to\r\nno other class in the community.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of March, therefore--two days after the report of the\r\ndeputation that had seen the king at Windsor--the Lords took the first\r\nstep towards the establishment of order and government, by electing\r\nRichard, Duke of York, as Protector and Defender of the realm.\r\n[Sidenote: The Duke of York Protector.] The title of Protector\r\nessentially implied an interim administrator during a period when the\r\nking, by legal or physical incapacity, was unable to exercise his regal\r\nfunctions in person. A Protector’s tenure of power was therefore always\r\nlimited by the clause _quamdiu Regi placeret_. It was terminable by the\r\nking himself the moment he found himself able to resume the actual\r\nduties of royalty. Even a protectorship like that of Humphrey, Duke of\r\nGloucester, instituted in consequence of the king being an infant, was\r\nterminated before the royal child was eight years old by the act of his\r\ncoronation. The crowned and anointed infant became a king indeed, and\r\ntherefore no longer required the services of a Protector; so from that\r\nday Duke Humphrey had ceased to wield any authority except that of an\r\nordinary member of the Council. But, indeed, even during his\r\nprotectorship, his powers were greatly circumscribed; and it had been\r\nexpressly decided by the Council that he was not competent to perform an\r\nact of state without the consent of a majority of the other Lords.\r\nRichard, therefore, knowing that his powers would be limited, was most\r\nanxious that his responsibility should be accurately defined, that no\r\none might accuse him thereafter of having exceeded the just limits of\r\nhis authority. He delivered in a paper containing certain articles, of\r\nwhich the first was as follows:--\r\n\r\n  ‘Howbeit that I am not sufficient of myself, of wisdom, cunning, nor\r\n  ability, to take upon me that worthy name of Protector and Defender\r\n  of this land, nor the charge thereto appertaining, whereunto it hath\r\n  liked you, my Lords, to call, name, and desire me unworthy\r\n  thereunto;--under protestation, if I shall apply me to the\r\n  performing of your said desire, and at your instance take upon me,\r\n  with your supportation, the said name and charge, I desire and pray\r\n  you that in this present Parliament and by authority thereof it be\r\n  enacted, that of yourself and of your free and mere disposition, ye\r\n  desire, name and call me to the said name and charge, and that of\r\n  any presumption of myself, I take them not upon me, but only of the\r\n  due and humble obeisance that I owe to do unto the king, our most\r\n  dread and Sovereign Lord, and to you the Peerage of this land, in\r\n  whom by the occasion of the infirmity of our said Sovereign Lord,\r\n  resteth the exercise of his authority, whose noble commandments I am\r\n  as ready to perform and obey as any his liege man alive; and at such\r\n  time as it shall please our blessed Creator to restore his noble\r\n  person to healthful disposition, it shall like you so to declare and\r\n  notify to his good grace.’[146-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 146-1: _Rolls of Parl._ v. 242.]\r\n\r\nIn reply to this, it was put on record that it was ‘thought by the Lords\r\nthat the said Duke desireth that of his great wisdom for his discharge.’\r\nAnd they, too, for their own justification, resolved that an Act should\r\nbe made according to a precedent during the king’s minority, setting\r\nforth that they themselves, from the sheer necessity of the case, had\r\nbeen compelled to take upon themselves the power of nominating a\r\nProtector. So jealous were the Lords of anything like an invasion of the\r\nroyal prerogative!\r\n\r\nFurther, the duke required that the Lords would aid him cordially in the\r\nexecution of his duties and would exactly define such powers and\r\nliberties as they meant him to exercise; that they would arrange what\r\nsalary he should receive; and that all the Lords Spiritual and Temporal\r\nbelonging to the King’s Council would agree to act in the Councils of\r\nthe Protector. These matters being at length satisfactorily adjusted,\r\nthe duke was formally created Protector by patent on the 3rd of April.\r\nIt was, however, at the same time provided by another patent that the\r\noffice should devolve on the king’s son as soon as he came of\r\nage.[146-2] After this, five Lords were appointed to have the keeping of\r\nthe sea against the king’s enemies, and in addition to the subsidies\r\nalready voted by Parliament for that object, a loan, amounting in all to\r\n£1000, was levied upon the different seaports.[146-3] This was but light\r\ntaxation, and was no doubt cheerfully submitted to. The good town of\r\nBristol, we know, did more than it was asked; for Sturmyn, the Mayor,\r\nfitted out a stately vessel expressly for the war.[146-4] Evidently\r\nthere were zeal and patriotism in the country whenever there was a\r\ngovernment that could make good use of them.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 146-2: _Ibid._ 243.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 146-3: _Rolls of Parl._ 244-5.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 146-4: No. 249.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Calais again in danger.] And there was real need of that\r\npatriotism; for the French were again threatening Calais. They also made\r\na descent in great force on the isles of Jersey and Guernsey, but were\r\ndefeated by the valour and loyalty of the inhabitants, who killed or\r\ntook prisoners no less than five hundred of their assailants.[147-1] A\r\nCouncil was called to meet at Westminster on the 6th of May, to take\r\nmeasures for the defence of Calais,[147-2] the result of which and of\r\nfurther deliberations on the subject was seen in the appointment of the\r\nDuke of York as captain or governor of the town, castle, and marches.\r\nThis office was granted to him by patent on the 18th of July,[147-3] but\r\nhe only agreed to undertake it, as he had done the Protectorship,\r\nsubject to certain express conditions to which he obtained the assent of\r\nthe Lords in Parliament. Among these was one stipulation touching his\r\nremuneration, in which he affirms that he had served the king formerly\r\nat his own cost in the important offices he had filled in France and in\r\nIreland, so that owing to non-payment of his salary, he had been obliged\r\nto sell part of his inheritance and pawn plate and jewels which were\r\nstill unredeemed.[147-4] A very different sort of governor this from the\r\navaricious Somerset!\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 147-1: No. 247.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 147-2: Nicolas’s _Privy Council Proceedings_, vi. 174.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 147-3: Rymer, xi. 351. Carte’s _Gascon and French\r\n    Rolls_.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 147-4: _Rolls of Parl._ v. 252.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile other changes had been made in the administration. On the 2nd\r\nof April--the day before the duke’s appointment as Protector--the Great\r\nSeal had been given to Richard Nevill, Earl of Salisbury, as chancellor;\r\n[Sidenote: Disturbances in the North.] and to prevent any renewal of\r\ndisturbances in the North by the earl’s former opponent Lord Egremont,\r\nhis father, the Earl of Northumberland, was summoned before the Council.\r\nBut before the day came which was given him to make his appearance, news\r\narrived that Lord Egremont had already been making large assemblies and\r\nissuing proclamations of rebellion, in concert with the Duke of Exeter.\r\nTo restore tranquillity, it was thought proper that the Duke of York\r\nshould go down into Yorkshire, where he no sooner made his appearance\r\nthan his presence seems to have put an end to all disturbances. The Duke\r\nof Exeter disappeared from the scene and was reported to have gone up\r\nsecretly to London; but the adherents of Lord Egremont continued to give\r\nsome trouble in Westmoreland. Thither the Duke of York accordingly\r\nreceived orders from the Council to proceed; but he probably found it\r\nunnecessary, for on the 8th of June it is stated that he intended\r\nremaining about York till after the 20th. Every appearance of\r\ndisturbance seems to have been quelled with ease; and a number of the\r\njustices having been sent into Yorkshire for the punishment of past\r\noffences, the Protector was able to return to London in the beginning of\r\nJuly.[148-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 148-1: Nicolas’s _Privy Council Proceedings_, vi. 178,\r\n    193-7. Nos. 247, 249.]\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that the two eldest sons of the Duke of York,\r\nEdward, Earl of March, and Edmund, Earl of Rutland, who were of the ages\r\nof twelve and eleven respectively, addressed the following interesting\r\nletter to their father:[148-2]--\r\n\r\n  ‘_To the ryght hiegh and myghty Prince, oure most worschipfull and\r\n  gretely redoubted lorde and fader, the Duke of Yorke, Protector and\r\n  Defensor of Englonde._\r\n\r\n  ‘Ryght hiegh and myghty Prince, oure most worschipfull and gretely\r\n  redoubted lorde and Fader, in as lowely wyse as any sonnes con or\r\n  may we recomaunde us un to youre good lordeschip.

Cott., Vespasian\r\n    F. xiii. fol. 35.]\r\n\r\nSoon after the duke had returned to London his presence was required at\r\na Great Council summoned for the 18th of July, to consider the\r\nexpediency of liberating on bail his great rival and personal enemy, the\r\nDuke of Somerset, who had been now seven months in prison. [Sidenote:\r\nThe Duke of Somerset.] On this point York had only one piece of advice\r\nto offer, which was, that as he had been committed to custody upon\r\nsuspicion of treason, the opinion of the judges should be taken before\r\nhe was released from confinement. That he had remained so long without a\r\ntrial was not unnatural, considering the nature of the times. It was a\r\nbold step indeed to try him at all, while there was a chance of the\r\nweak-minded king’s recovery; but this step was certainly resolved on.\r\nThe 28th of October was the day appointed for his trial; and the Duke of\r\nNorfolk, who, as we have seen, had been the first to move the capital\r\ncharge against him, was ordered by that day to be ready to produce his\r\nproofs. Meanwhile the lords concurred that it was clearly inexpedient to\r\nlet him go, especially as the number of lords assembled was not so great\r\nas it should have been on the occasion; and the opinion of the Duke of\r\nYork was not only agreed to, but at his request was put on\r\nrecord.[149-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 149-1: Nicolas’s _Privy Council Proceedings_, vi. 207.]\r\n\r\nSix days later it was agreed at another meeting of the Council that the\r\nDuke of York should return into the North with the Duke of Exeter in his\r\ncustody, whom he was to confine in the castle of Pomfret as a state\r\nprisoner.[150-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 150-1: Nicolas’s _Privy Council Proceedings_, vi. 217,\r\n    218.]\r\n\r\nBy these decisive steps the authority of the Duke of York was at length\r\nsecured on something like a stable footing. During the remainder of his\r\nprotectorate there could no longer be a doubt to whose hands power was\r\ncommitted; and England, at last, had the blessing of real government,\r\nable and vigorous, but at the same time moderate. The resolutions of the\r\nCouncil soon became known to the public. ‘As for tidings,’ wrote William\r\nPaston to his brother in Norfolk, ‘my lord of York hath taken my lord of\r\nExeter into his award. The Duke of Somerset is still in prison, in worse\r\ncase than he was.’ William Paston wrote in haste, but these were two\r\nmatters of public importance to be mentioned before all private affairs\r\nwhatever.[150-2] And yet the private affairs of which he wrote in the\r\nsame letter will not be without interest to the readers of this\r\nIntroduction. [Sidenote: Sir J. Fastolf goes to reside in Norfolk.]\r\nWilliam Paston now reported to his brother that Sir John Fastolf was\r\nabout to take his journey into Norfolk within a few days, and proposed\r\nto take up his residence at Caister. His going thither must have been\r\nregarded as an event not only in the neighbourhood of Yarmouth but even\r\nin the city of Norwich. At all events it was highly important to John\r\nPaston, whose advice the old knight valued in many matters. ‘He saith,’\r\nwrote William Paston to his brother, ‘ye are the heartiest kinsman and\r\nfriend that he knoweth. He would have you at Mauteby[150-3] dwelling.’\r\nThis must have been written in the latter part of July. Sir John did not\r\nactually go into Norfolk quite so soon as he intended; but he appears to\r\nhave been there by the beginning of September.[150-4]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 150-2: No. 254.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 150-3: The manor of Mauteby, which came to John Paston\r\n    by his marriage, was only three miles distant from Caister.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 150-4: No. 260.]\r\n\r\nThere in his completed castle of Caister he had at length taken up his\r\nabode, to spend the evening of his days in the place of his birth, and\r\non the inheritance of his ancestors. There during the next five years he\r\nspent his time, counting over the items of a number of unsettled claims\r\nhe had against the crown,[151-1] and meditating also, it would seem, on\r\nanother account he had with Heaven. For the latter the foundation of a\r\ncollege[151-2] or religious endowment, in which were to be maintained\r\n‘seven priests and seven poor folk’ at Caister, might possibly liquidate\r\nhis debts. But in his transactions with his fellowmen he was certainly\r\nfor the most part a creditor, and by no means one of the most generous.\r\nInstances will be found in his letters in abundance showing with what\r\nvehemence (testy old soldier that he was!) he perpetually insisted on\r\nwhat was due to himself;--how he desired to know the names of those who\r\nwould presume to resist his agent, Sir Thomas Howes--how they should be\r\nrequited ‘by Blackbeard or Whitebeard, that is to say, by God or the\r\nDevil’;[151-3]--how he noted that Sir John Buck had fished his stanks\r\nand helped to break his dam;[151-4] how he had been informed that at a\r\ndinner at Norwich certain gentlemen had used scornful language about\r\nhim, and desired to know who they were.[151-5] In this perpetual\r\nself-assertion he seems neither to have been over-indulgent towards\r\nadversaries nor even sufficiently considerate of friends and dependants.\r\n‘Cruel and vengeable he hath been ever,’ says his own servant Henry\r\nWindsor, ‘and for the most part without pity and mercy.’[151-6] So also\r\non the part of his faithful secretary, William Worcester, we find a\r\ncomplaint of shabby treatment, apparently at this very time when the\r\nhousehold was removed to Caister. To a letter in which John Paston had\r\naddressed him as ‘Master Worcester,’ the latter replied with a request\r\nthat he would ‘forget that name of mastership,’ for his position was by\r\nno means so greatly improved as to entitle him to such respect. His\r\nsalary was not increased by one farthing in certainty--only ‘wages of\r\nhousehold in common, _entaunt come nows plaira_’--which apparently\r\nmeans, assured to him only during his master’s pleasure. When he\r\ncomplained to his master of this, all the satisfaction he obtained was\r\nthat Sir John expressed a wish he had been a priest, when he could have\r\nrewarded him with a living.[152-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 151-1: Nos. 309, 310.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 151-2: Nos. 340, 350, 351, 385, 386, 387.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 151-3: No. 125.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 151-4: Nos. 160, 161.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 151-5: No. 272.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 151-6: No. 332.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 152-1: Nos. 258, 259.]\r\n\r\nThere are, indeed, in more than one of Worcester’s letters in this\r\ncollection symptoms of ill-concealed chagrin and disappointment. Nor\r\nwere such feelings unnatural in one who, probably out of regard for an\r\nill-appreciated hero, had devoted the best energies of his life to the\r\nservices of such a master as Fastolf. [Sidenote: William Worcester.] A\r\nnative of Bristol, the son of one William Worcester, who lived in St.\r\nJames’s Bec in that town, he was descended by the mother’s side from a\r\nwealthy family of Coventry, and often called himself, instead of\r\nWorcester, by his mother’s maiden name of Botoner. Born in the year\r\n1415, he had entered the university of Oxford in 1432, and been four\r\nyears a student at Hart Hall, now Balliol College; after which he had\r\ngone into Fastolf’s service. For many years he had been steward of Sir\r\nJohn’s manor of Castle Combe in Wiltshire, and MSS. still exist in his\r\nhandwriting relating to the holding of manorial courts there.[152-2] He\r\nhad also been Fastolf’s secretary in drawing up various statements\r\nregarding the wars in France in vindication of his master’s\r\npolicy.[152-3] He was a man of literary tastes, who had already\r\npresented some compositions to his patron.[152-4] Later in life he wrote\r\na book of annals, which is an important historical authority for the\r\nperiod. It seems to have been about a year before his master’s death\r\nthat he set himself assiduously to learn French, under the tuition of a\r\nLombard named Caroll Giles.[152-5] From this instructor he had purchased\r\nseveral books, and Henry Windsor suspected he had run himself into debt\r\nin consequence. He had fairly owned to Windsor ‘he would be as glad and\r\nas fain of a good book of French or of poetry, as my master Fastolf\r\nwould be to purchase a fair manor.’[152-6] But he had a special object\r\nin view in which a knowledge of this language was important; for he had\r\nbegun translating, at Fastolf’s request, from a French version, Cicero’s\r\ntreatise _de Senectute_. This work appears to have been left on his\r\nhands at Sir John Fastolf’s death, and on the 10th of August 1473 he\r\npresented it to his patron’s old friend, Bishop Waynflete, at Esher.\r\n‘Sed nullum regardum recepi de episcopo’ (but I received no reward from\r\nthe bishop), is his melancholy comment on the occasion.[153-1] The work\r\nwas ultimately printed by Caxton in 1481. Worcester was an assiduous\r\ncollector of information on topics of every description, and a number of\r\nhis commonplace books remain at this day. But like many men of letters\r\nafter him, he found that industry of this sort may look in vain for any\r\nreward beyond the satisfaction of gratified curiosity.[153-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 152-2: Add. MS. 28,208, B.M.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 152-3: Stevenson’s _Wars_, ii. [519], _sq._]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 152-4: ‘Stellæ versificatæ pro anno 1440 ad instantiam\r\n    J. Fastolfe militis.’ MS. Laud., B. 23 (according to the old\r\n    pressmark).]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 152-5: Letter 370.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 152-6: In previous editions it was here remarked:--‘This\r\n    French zeal appears to have excited the contempt of some of his\r\n    acquaintances--among others of Friar Brackley, who nicknamed him\r\n    Colinus Gallicus.’ The discovery of additional letters, formerly\r\n    published in a Supplement, but now incorporated with the series,\r\n    seems to show that this was an error, or at all events very\r\n    doubtful. It is clear from Letter 404 that a certain ‘W. W.’ and\r\n    Colinus Gallicus were different persons (_see_ vol. iii. p. 213,\r\n    note 3), and the references to ‘W. W.’ at p. 230 as the knight’s\r\n    secretary and one of his executors remove any doubt that we might\r\n    otherwise entertain that he was William Worcester. But a new\r\n    difficulty arises from that identification, that Friar Brackley\r\n    calls ‘W. W.’ an Irishman, which William Worcester was not; and\r\n    the references at p. 220 of the same volume would imply that he\r\n    was really an Irishman in nationality, and also a one-eyed man of\r\n    dark visage. Such may have been Worcester’s personal appearance;\r\n    but why was he called an Irishman?\r\n\r\n    It is with some hesitation that I hazard a new conjecture as\r\n    to the person nicknamed Colinus Gallicus; but on comparing the\r\n    different passages where that nickname occurs, I am inclined\r\n    to think it was meant for Judge Yelverton.]\r\n\r\n  [[p. iii. 230 = Letter 417; p. iii. 220 = Letter 409]]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 153-1: Itin. 368.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 153-2: Tanner’s _Bibliotheca_. _See_ also a notice of\r\n    William Worcester in _Retrospective Review_, Second Series, ii.\r\n    451-4.]\r\n\r\nAlong with the announcement that Sir John Fastolf was about to go into\r\nNorfolk, William Paston informed his brother that the old knight’s\r\nstepson, Stephen Scrope, would reside at Caister along with him.\r\n[Sidenote: Stephen Scrope.] Of this Stephen Scrope our Letters make not\r\nunfrequent mention; but the leading facts of his history are obtained\r\nfrom other sources. He was the son of Sir Stephen Scrope, by his wife\r\nLady Milicent, who married Fastolf after her husband’s death. At the\r\ntime of this second marriage of his mother, young Scrope was about ten\r\nor twelve years of age, and being heir to a considerable property, his\r\nstepfather had the management of his affairs during his minority.\r\nBitterly did he complain in after years of the manner in which Sir John\r\nhad discharged the trust. According to the unfeeling, mercenary fashion\r\nin which such matters were then managed, Fastolf sold his wardship to\r\nChief-Justice Gascoigne for 500 marks; ‘through the which sale,’ wrote\r\nScrope at a later date, ‘I took sickness that kept me a thirteen or\r\nfourteen years [en]suing; whereby I am disfigured in my person and shall\r\nbe whilst I live.’ Gascoigne held this wardship for three years, and by\r\nright of it intended to marry Scrope to one of his own daughters; but as\r\nthe young lad’s friends thought the match unequal to his fortune,\r\nFastolf bought the wardship back again.[154-1] Stephen Scrope, however,\r\nwhen he grew up, was not more grateful for the redemption than for the\r\noriginal sale of his person. ‘He bought me and sold me as a beast’ (so\r\nhe writes of Sir John Fastolf), ‘against all right and law, to mine hurt\r\nmore than 1000 marks.’ In consequence of the stinginess of his\r\nstepfather he was obliged, on coming of age, to sell a manor which was\r\npart of his inheritance and take service with Humphrey, Duke of\r\nGloucester in France; by whom, according to his own account, he had some\r\nhope of obtaining restitution of the lordship of the Isle of Man, which\r\nhad belonged to his uncle the Earl of Wiltshire in the days of Richard\r\nII. But Sir John Fastolf got him to give up his engagement with the duke\r\nand serve with himself, which he did for several years, to the\r\nsatisfaction of both parties. Afterwards, however, on some dispute\r\narising, Scrope returned to England, when Sir John sent home word that\r\nhe must pay for his meat and drink. To do this he was driven to contract\r\na marriage which, by his own account, was not the most advantageous for\r\nhimself; and his stepfather, instead of showing him any compassion,\r\nbrought an action against him by which he was deprived of all the little\r\nproperty that his wife had brought him.[154-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 154-1: No. 97.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 154-2: Scrope’s _History of the Manor of Castle Combe_,\r\n    pp. 264-283. The MSS. formerly at Castle Combe, to which Mr.\r\n    Scrope refers in this work, have since been presented by him and\r\n    Mr. Lowndes, the present lord of the manor, to the British Museum.\r\n    One of them we have reprinted in No. 97.]\r\n\r\nOf this first wife of Stephen Scrope we know nothing,[154-3] except that\r\nshe died and left him a daughter some years before we find any mention\r\nof him in the Paston correspondence. His necessities now compelled him\r\nto resort to the same evil system of bargaining in flesh and blood of\r\nwhich he had complained in his own case. ‘For very need,’ he writes, ‘I\r\nwas fain to sell a little daughter I have for much less than I should\r\nhave done by possibility,’--a considerable point in his complaint being\r\nevidently the lowness of the price he got for his own child. It seems\r\nthat he disposed of her wardship to a knight[155-1] whose name does not\r\nappear; but the terms of the contract became matter of interest some\r\ntime afterwards to John Paston and his mother, when Scrope, who, besides\r\nbeing disfigured in person, was probably not far from fifty years of\r\nage, made an offer for the hand of Paston’s sister Elizabeth, a girl of\r\nabout twenty. The proposed match did not take effect; but it was for\r\nsome time seriously entertained. Agnes Paston writes that she found the\r\nyoung lady herself ‘never so willing to none as she is to him, if it be\r\nso that his land stand clear.’[155-2] The reader will perhaps think from\r\nthis expression that the young lady had been pretty early taught the\r\nimportance of considering worldly prospects; but there were other\r\nmotives which not improbably helped to influence her judgment. ‘She was\r\nnever in so great sorrow as she is now-a-days,’ wrote Elizabeth Clere to\r\nJohn Paston, as a reason for concluding the matter at once with Scrope,\r\nif no more desirable suitor presented himself. Her mother would not\r\nallow her to see any visitor, and was suspicious even of her intercourse\r\nwith the servants of her own house. ‘And she hath since Easter the most\r\npart been beaten once in the week or twice, and sometimes twice in one\r\nday, and her head broken in two or three places.’[155-3] Such was the\r\nrough domestic discipline to which even girls in those days were\r\noccasionally subjected!\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 154-3: She is not unlikely to have been the lady\r\n    mentioned in No. 97. ‘Fauconer’s daughter of London, that Sir\r\n    Reynold Cobham had wedded.’ This I find need not have been, as I\r\n    have stated in a footnote, the widow of Sir Reginald Cobham of\r\n    Sterborough, who died in 1446; for there was an earlier Sir\r\n    Reginald Cobham, whose widow Elizabeth was married to William\r\n    Clifford as early as 1438. (_Inquisitions post mortem_, 16 Hen.\r\n    VI. No. 31.) Thus there is the less difficulty in attributing\r\n    Letter 97 to a much earlier date than that assigned to it by the\r\n    endorsement.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 155-1: Letter 94.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 155-2: No. 93.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 155-3: No. 94.]\r\n\r\nSome years certainly elapsed after this before either Stephen Scrope\r\nfound a wife or Elizabeth Paston a husband. The former ultimately\r\nmarried Joan, the daughter of Richard Bingham, judge of the King’s\r\nBench; the latter was married to Robert Poynings, whom we have already\r\nhad occasion to notice as an ally of Jack Cade in 1450, and a ringleader\r\nin other movements a few years later. This second marriage appears to\r\nhave taken place about New Year’s Day 1459;[156-1] before which time we\r\nfind various other proposals for her hand besides that of Scrope.[156-2]\r\nAmong these it may be noted that Edmund, Lord Grey of Hastings, wrote to\r\nher brother to say that he knew a gentleman with property worth 300\r\nmarks (£200) a year to whom she might be disposed of. No doubt, as in\r\nsimilar cases, this gentleman was a feudal ward, whose own opinion was\r\nthe very last that was consulted as to the lady to whom he should be\r\nunited. But it is time that we return to the current of public\r\naffairs.[156-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 156-1: _See_ No. 374.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 156-2: Nos. 236, 250, 252.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 156-3: We ought not to leave unnoticed one fact in the\r\n    relations of Scrope and Fastolf which is much more creditable to\r\n    both of them than the disputes above mentioned. In the year 1450,\r\n    Scrope translated from the French and dedicated to Sir John, ‘for\r\n    his contemplation and solace,’ a work entitled _Ditz de\r\n    Philosophius_ (Sayings of Philosophers), of which the original MS.\r\n    is now in the Harleian Collection, No. 2266. That Fastolf was a\r\n    real lover of literature, and encouraged literary tastes in those\r\n    about him, there can be no question.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Strife of Parties_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The king’s recovery.] At Christmas, to the great joy of the\r\nnation, the king began to recover from his sad illness. He woke up, as\r\nit were, from a long sleep. So decidedly had he regained his faculties,\r\nthat, first, on St. John’s Day (27th December), he commanded his almoner\r\nto ride to Canterbury with an offering, and his secretary to present\r\nanother at the shrine of St. Edward. On the following Monday, the 30th,\r\nthe queen came to him and brought with her the infant prince, for whom\r\nnearly twelve months before she had in vain endeavoured to bespeak his\r\nnotice. What occurred at that touching interview we know from a letter\r\nof Edmund Clere to John Paston, and it would be impossible to wish it\r\nrecorded in other words. ‘And then he asked what the Prince’s name was,\r\nand the queen told him “Edward”; and then he held up his hands and\r\nthanked God thereof. And he said he never knew till that time, nor wist\r\nwhat was said to him, nor wist not where he had been whilst he hath been\r\nsick, till now. And he asked who was godfathers, and the queen told him;\r\nand he was well apaid. And she told him that the cardinal (Kemp) was\r\ndead; and he said he knew never thereof till that time; and he said one\r\nof the wisest lords in this land was dead.’[157-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 157-1: No. 270.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1455.] On the 7th of January, Bishop Waynflete and the\r\nPrior of St. John’s were admitted to speak with him, and finding his\r\ndiscourse as clear and coherent as they had ever known it, on coming out\r\nof the audience chamber they wept for joy.[157-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 157-2: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\nJoy was doubtless the prevailing sentiment among all ranks and classes\r\nof people; but there was one to whom the news of the king’s recovery\r\nmust have afforded a delight and satisfaction beyond what any one\r\nelse--unless it were Queen Margaret--could possibly derive from it. The\r\nDuke of Somerset had now lain in prison more than a year. The day\r\nappointed for his trial had passed away and nothing had been done. It\r\ncertainly casts some suspicion upon the even-handed justice of the Duke\r\nof York, that his adversary was thus denied a hearing; but the fault may\r\nhave been due, after all, to weakness more than malice. In cases of\r\ntreason, when once a trial was instituted against a leading nobleman,\r\na conviction was, in those days, an absolutely invariable result; but\r\nthis made it a thing all the more dangerous to attempt when it was\r\nhopeless to expect the positive sanction of the king. The real cause,\r\nhowever, why Somerset was not brought to trial can only be a matter of\r\nconjecture. His continued confinement, however harsh, was, according to\r\nthe practice of those days, legal; nor was it till six weeks after the\r\nking’s recovery that he was restored to liberty. A new day, meanwhile,\r\nand not a very early one, was fixed for the hearing of charges against\r\nhim. On the morrow of All Souls--the 3rd of November following--he was\r\nto appear before the Council. This was determined on the 5th of\r\nFebruary. Four lords undertook to give surety in their own proper\r\npersons that he would make his appearance on the day named; and orders\r\nwere immediately issued to release him from confinement.[158-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 158-1: Rymer, xi. 361.]\r\n\r\nOn the 4th day of March, he presented himself at a Council held before\r\nthe king in his palace at Greenwich. The Duke of York was present, with\r\nten bishops and twenty temporal peers, among whom were the Protector’s\r\nfriend, the Earl of Salisbury, Lord Chancellor, the Earl of Worcester,\r\nTreasurer of England, and the king’s half-brother, the Earl of Pembroke.\r\nHis accuser, the Duke of Norfolk, was absent, probably not without a\r\nreason. In presence of the assembled lords, Somerset then declared that\r\nhe had been imprisoned without a cause and confined in the Tower of\r\nLondon one whole year and more than ten weeks over, and had only been\r\nliberated on bail on the 7th of February. So, as he declared there was\r\nno charge made against him for which he deserved to be confined, he\r\nbesought the king that his sureties might be discharged; offering, if\r\nany one would accuse him of anything contrary to his allegiance, that he\r\nwould be ready at all times to answer according to law and like a true\r\nknight. [Sidenote: Somerset released.] His protestations of loyalty were\r\nat once accepted by the king, who thereupon declared that he knew the\r\nduke to be his true and faithful liegeman, and wished it to be\r\nunderstood that he so reputed him. After this, the mouths of all\r\nadversaries were of course sealed up. The duke’s bail were discharged.\r\nHis character was cleared from every insinuation of disloyalty; and\r\nwhatever questions might remain between him and the Duke of York were\r\nreferred to the arbitration of eight other lords, whose judgment both\r\nparties were bound over in recognisances of 20,000 marks, that they\r\nwould abide.[158-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 158-2: _Ibid._ 362, 363.]\r\n\r\nThe significance of all this could not be doubtful. The king’s recovery\r\nhad put an end to the Duke of York’s power as Protector, and he was\r\ndetermined to be guided once more by the counsels of the queen and\r\nSomerset. On the 6th March, York was deprived of the government of\r\nCalais which he had undertaken by indenture for seven years.[159-1] On\r\nthe 7th, the Great Seal was taken from the Earl of Salisbury and given\r\nto Thomas Bourchier, Archbishop of Canterbury. These changes, or at\r\nleast the former, promised little good to the country; and in the\r\nbeginning of May we not only find that Calais stood again in imminent\r\ndanger of siege,[159-2] but that considerable fears were entertained of\r\nan invasion of England.[159-3] But to the Duke of York they gave cause\r\nfor personal apprehension. Notwithstanding the specious appointment of a\r\ntribunal to settle the controversy between him and Somerset, it was\r\nutterly impossible for him to expect anything like an equitable\r\nadjustment. A Council was called at Westminster in the old exclusive\r\nspirit, neither York nor any of his friends being summoned to attend it.\r\nA Great Council was then arranged to meet at Leicester long before the\r\nday on which judgment was to be given by the arbitrators; and it was\r\nfeared both by York and his friends, the Earls of Salisbury and Warwick,\r\nthat if they ventured to appear there they would find themselves\r\nentrapped. The ostensible ground of the calling of that council was to\r\nprovide for the surety of the king’s person; from which it was fairly to\r\nbe conjectured that a suspicion of treason was to be insinuated against\r\npersons who were too deservedly popular to be arrested in London with\r\nsafety to the Government.[159-4]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 159-1: Rymer, xi. 363.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 159-2: _Privy Council Proceedings_, vi. 234-8.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 159-3: On the _Patent Roll_, 33. Hen. VI. p. 19 _d._, is\r\n    a commission dated 5th May, for keeping watch on the coast of Kent\r\n    against invasion.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 159-4: _Rolls of Parl._ v. 280-1.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: York and his friends take arms.] York had by this time\r\nretired into the north, and uniting with Salisbury and Warwick, it was\r\ndetermined by all three that the cause assigned for the calling of the\r\nCouncil justified them in seeking the king’s presence with a strong body\r\nof followers. On the 20th May they arrived at Royston, and from thence\r\naddressed a letter to Archbishop Bourchier, as Chancellor, in which they\r\nnot only repudiated all intention of disloyalty, but declared that, as\r\nthe Council was summoned for the surety of the king’s person, they had\r\nbrought with them a company of armed followers expressly for his\r\nprotection. If any real danger was to be apprehended they were come to\r\ndo him service; but if their own personal enemies were abusing their\r\ninfluence with the king to inspire him with causeless distrust, they\r\nwere determined to remove unjust suspicions, and relied on their armed\r\ncompanies for protection to themselves. Meanwhile they requested the\r\narchbishop’s intercession to explain to Henry the true motives of their\r\nconduct.[160-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 160-1: _Rolls of Parl._ v. 280-1.]\r\n\r\nNext day they marched on to Ware, and there penned an address to the\r\nking himself, of which copies seem to have been diffused, either at the\r\ntime or very shortly afterwards, in justification of their proceedings.\r\nOne of these came to the hands of John Paston, and the reader may\r\nconsequently peruse the memorial for himself in Volume III.[160-2] In\r\nit, as will be seen, York and his friends again made most urgent protest\r\nof their good intent, and complained grievously of the unfair\r\nproceedings of their enemies in excluding them from the royal presence\r\nand poisoning the king’s mind with doubts of their allegiance. They\r\ndeclared that they had no other intent in seeking the king’s presence\r\nthan to prove themselves his true liegemen by doing him all the service\r\nin their power; and they referred him further to a copy of their letter\r\nto the archbishop, which they thought it well to forward along with\r\ntheir memorial, as they had not been informed that he had shown its\r\ncontents to the king.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 160-2: No. 282.]\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, neither the letter to the archbishop nor the memorial\r\nto the king himself was allowed to come to Henry’s hands. The\r\narchbishop, indeed, had done his duty, and on receipt of the letter to\r\nhimself had sent it on, with all haste, to Kilburn, where his messenger\r\novertook the king on his way northwards from London. But the man was not\r\nadmitted into the royal presence; for the Duke of Somerset and his\r\nfriends were determined the Yorkists should not be heard, that their\r\nadvance might wear as much as possible the aspect of a rebellion. York\r\nand his allies accordingly marched on from Ware to St. Albans, where\r\nthey arrived at an early hour on the morning of the 22nd. Meanwhile the\r\nking, who had left London the day before, accompanied by the Dukes of\r\nBuckingham and Somerset, his half-brother, Jasper Tudor, Earl of\r\nPembroke, the Earls of Northumberland, Devonshire, Stafford, Dorset, and\r\nWiltshire, and a number of other lords, knights, and gentlemen,\r\namounting in all to upwards of 2000, arrived at the very same place just\r\nbefore them, having rested at Watford the previous night. Anticipating\r\nthe approach of the Duke of York, the king and his friends occupied the\r\nsuburb of St. Peter’s, which lay on that side of the town by which the\r\nduke must necessarily come. The duke accordingly, and the Earls of\r\nSalisbury and Warwick, drew up their forces in the Keyfield, outside the\r\nbarriers of the town. From seven in the morning till near ten o’clock\r\nthe two hosts remained facing each other without a blow being struck;\r\nduring which time the duke and the two earls, still endeavouring to\r\nobtain a peaceful interview with the king, petitioned to have an answer\r\nto their memorial of the preceding day. They were told in reply that it\r\nhad not been received by the king, on which they made new and more\r\nurgent representations. At first, it would seem, they demanded access to\r\nthe royal presence to declare and justify their true intentions; but\r\nwhen this could not be obtained, they made a still more obnoxious\r\nrequest. They insisted that certain persons whom they would accuse of\r\ntreason should be delivered into their hands, reminding the king, as\r\nrespectfully as the fact could be alluded to, that past experience would\r\nnot permit them to trust to a mere promise on his part that a traitor\r\nshould be kept in confinement.[161-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 161-1: No. 283. _Rolls of Parl._ v. 281-2.]\r\n\r\nFor the answer made to this demand, and for the details of the battle\r\nwhich ensued, we may as well refer the reader to the very curious paper\r\n(No. 283) from which we have already derived most of the above\r\nparticulars. We are not here writing the history of the times, and it\r\nmay be sufficient for us to say that York and his friends were\r\ncompletely victorious. The action lasted only half an hour. [Sidenote:\r\nBattle of St. Albans.] The Duke of Somerset was slain, and with him the\r\nEarl of Northumberland, Lords Clifford and Clinton, with about 400\r\npersons of inferior rank, as the numbers were at first reported. This,\r\nhowever, seems to have been an over-estimate.[162-1] The king himself\r\nwas wounded by an arrow in the neck, and, after the engagement, was\r\ntaken prisoner; while the Earl of Wiltshire, and the Duke of York’s old\r\nenemy, Thorpe, fled disgracefully. When all was over, the duke with the\r\ntwo earls came humbly and knelt before the king, beseeching his\r\nforgiveness for what they had done in his presence, and requesting him\r\nto acknowledge them as his true liegemen, seeing that they had never\r\nintended to do him personal injury. To this Henry at once agreed, and\r\ntook them once more into favour.[162-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 162-1: John Crane, writing from Lambeth on Whitsunday,\r\n    three days after the battle, says, ‘at most six score.’ No. 285.\r\n    Another authority says, ‘60 persons of gentlemen and other.’\r\n    _English Chronicle_, ed. Davies, p. 72.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 162-2: Nos. 283, 284, 285.]\r\n\r\nThus again was effected ‘a change of ministry’--by sharper and more\r\nviolent means than had formerly been employed, but certainly by the only\r\nmeans which had now become at all practicable. The government of\r\nSomerset was distinctly unconstitutional. The deliberate and systematic\r\nexclusion from the king’s councils of a leading peer of the realm--of\r\none who, by mere hereditary right, quite apart from natural capacity and\r\nfitness, was entitled at any time to give his advice to royalty, was a\r\ncrime that could not be justified. For conduct very similar the two\r\nSpencers had been banished by Parliament in the days of Edward II.; and\r\nif it had been suffered now to remain unpunished, there would not have\r\nexisted the smallest check upon arbitrary government and intolerable\r\nmaladministration.\r\n\r\nSuch, we may be well assured, was the feeling of the city of London,\r\nwhich on the day following the battle received the victors in triumph\r\nwith a general procession.[162-3] The Duke of York conducted the king to\r\nthe Bishop of London’s palace, and a council being assembled, writs were\r\nsent out for a Parliament to meet on the 9th of July following.[162-4]\r\nMeanwhile the duke was made Constable of England, and Lord Bourchier,\r\nTreasurer. The defence of Calais was committed to the Earl of\r\nWarwick.[162-5] There was, however, no entire and sweeping change made\r\nin the officers of state. The Great Seal was allowed to continue in the\r\nhands of Archbishop Bourchier.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 162-3: No. 284.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 162-4: No. 283.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 162-5: No. 285.]\r\n\r\nIt remained, however, for Parliament to ratify what had been done.\r\nHowever justifiable in a moral point of view, the conduct of York and\r\nhis allies wore an aspect of violence towards the sovereign, which made\r\nit necessary that its legality should be investigated by the highest\r\ncourt in the realm. Inquiry was made both in Parliament and by the\r\nking’s Council which of the lords about the king had been responsible\r\nfor provoking the collision. Angry and unpleasant feelings, as might be\r\nexpected, burst out in consequence. The Earl of Warwick accused Lord\r\nCromwell to the king, and when the latter attempted to vindicate\r\nhimself, swore that what he stated was untrue. So greatly was Lord\r\nCromwell intimidated, that the Earl of Shrewsbury, at his request, took\r\nup his lodging at St. James’s, beside the Mews, for his protection. The\r\nretainers of York, Warwick, and Salisbury went about fully armed, and\r\nkept their lords’ barges on the river amply furnished with weapons.\r\nProclamations, however, were presently issued against bearing arms. The\r\nParliament, at last, laid the whole blame of the encounter upon the\r\ndeceased Duke of Somerset, and the courtiers Thorpe and Joseph; and by\r\nan Act which received the royal assent, it was declared that the Duke of\r\nYork and his friends had acted the part of good and faithful subjects.\r\n‘To the which bill,’ said Henry Windsor in a letter to his friends\r\nBocking and Worcester, ‘many a man grudged full sore now it is past’;\r\nbut he requested them to burn a communication full of such uncomfortable\r\nmatter to comment upon as the quarrels and heartburnings of\r\nlords.[163-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 163-1: No. 299.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Parliamentary elections.] But with whatever grudge it may\r\nhave been that Parliament condoned the acts of the Yorkists, it seems\r\nnot to have been without some degree of pressure that the duke and his\r\nallies obtained a Parliament so much after their own minds. Here, for\r\ninstance, we have the Duchess of Norfolk writing to John Paston, just\r\nbefore the election, that it was thought necessary ‘that my lord have at\r\nthis time in the Parliament such persons as long unto him and be of his\r\nmenial servants (!)’; on which account she requests his vote and\r\ninfluence in favour of John Howard and Sir Roger Chamberlain.[164-1] The\r\napplication could scarcely have been agreeable to the person to whom it\r\nwas addressed; for it seems that John Paston himself had on this\r\noccasion some thought of coming forward as a candidate for Norfolk.\r\nException was taken to John Howard, one of the duke’s nominees (who,\r\nabout eight-and-twenty years later, was created Duke of Norfolk himself,\r\nand was the ancestor of the present ducal family), on the ground that he\r\npossessed no lands within the county;[164-2] and at the nomination the\r\nnames of Berney, Grey, and Paston were received with great\r\nfavour.[164-3] John Jenney thought it ‘an evil precedent for the shire\r\nthat a strange man should be chosen, and no worship to my lord of York\r\nnor to my lord of Norfolk to write for him; for if the gentlemen of the\r\nshire will suffer such inconvenience, in good faith the shire shall not\r\nbe called of such worship as it hath been.’ So unpopular, in fact, was\r\nHoward’s candidature that the Duke of Norfolk was half persuaded to give\r\nhim up, declaring, that since his return was objected to he would write\r\nto the under-sheriff that the shire should have free election, provided\r\nthey did not choose Sir Thomas Tuddenham or any of the old adherents of\r\nthe Duke of Suffolk. And so, for a time it seemed as if free election\r\nwould be allowed. The under-sheriff even ventured to write to John\r\nPaston that he meant to return his name and that of Master Grey;\r\n‘nevertheless,’ he added significantly, ‘I have a master.’ Howard\r\nappeared to be savage with disappointment. He was ‘as wode’ (_i.e._\r\nmad), wrote John Jenney, ‘as a wild bullock.’ But in the end it appeared\r\nhe had no need to be exasperated, for when the poll came to be taken, he\r\nand the other nominee of the Duke of Norfolk were found to have gained\r\nthe day.[164-4]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 164-1: No. 288.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 164-2: Nos. 294, 295.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 164-3: No. 291.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 164-4: No. 295.]\r\n\r\nBesides the act of indemnity for the Duke of York and his partisans, and\r\na new oath of allegiance being sworn to by the Lords, little was done at\r\nthis meeting of the Parliament. On the 31st July it was prorogued, to\r\nmeet again upon the 12th November. But in the interval another\r\ncomplication had arisen. The king, who seems to have suffered in health\r\nfrom the severe shock that he must have received by the battle of St.\r\nAlbans,[165-1] had felt the necessity of retirement to recover his\r\ncomposure, and had withdrawn before the meeting of Parliament to\r\nHertford; at which time the Duke of York, in order to be near him, took\r\nup his quarters at the Friars at Ware.[165-2] He was well, or at all\r\nevents well enough to open Parliament in person on the 9th July; but\r\nshortly afterwards he retired to Hertford again, where according to the\r\ndates of his Privy Seals, I find that he remained during August and\r\nSeptember. [Sidenote: The king again ill.] In the month of October\r\nfollowing he was still there, and it was reported that he had fallen\r\nsick of his old infirmity;--which proved to be too true.[165-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 165-1: _See_ Rymer, xi. 366.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 165-2: No. 287.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 165-3: No. 303.]\r\n\r\nAltogether matters looked gloomy enough. Change of ministry by force of\r\narms, whatever might be said for it, was not a thing to win the\r\nconfidence either of king or people. There were prophecies bruited about\r\nthat another battle would take place before St. Andrew’s Day--the\r\ngreatest that had been since the battle of Shrewsbury in the days of\r\nHenry IV. One Dr. Green ventured to predict it in detail. The scene of\r\nthe conflict was to be between the Bishop of Salisbury’s Inn and\r\nWestminster Bars, and three bishops and four temporal lords were to be\r\namong the slain. The Londoners were spared this excitement; but from the\r\ncountry there came news of a party outrage committed by the eldest son\r\nof the Earl of Devonshire, on a dependant of the Lord Bonvile,\r\n[Sidenote: Disturbances in the West.] and the West of England seems to\r\nhave been disturbed for some time afterwards.[165-4] From a local MS.\r\nchronicle cited by Holinshed, it appears that a regular pitched battle\r\ntook place between the two noblemen on Clist Heath, about two miles from\r\nExeter, in which Lord Bonvile having gained the victory, entered\r\ntriumphantly into the city. A modern historian of Exeter, however, seems\r\nto have read the MS. differently, and tells us that Lord Bonvile was\r\ndriven into the city by defeat.[165-5] However this may be, the Earl of\r\nDevonshire did not allow the matter to rest. Accompanied by a large body\r\nof retainers--no less, it is stated, than 800 horse and 4000 foot--he\r\nattacked the Dean and Canons of Exeter, made several of the latter\r\nprisoners, and robbed the cathedral.[166-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 165-4: No. 303. _See_ also a brief account of the same\r\n    affair in W. Worcester’s _Itinerary_, p. 114.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 165-5: Jenkins’s _History of Exeter_, p. 78.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 166-1: _Rolls of Parl._ v. 285. It may be observed that\r\n    the bishopric was at this time vacant, and the dean, whose name\r\n    was John Hals, had received a papal provision to be the new\r\n    bishop, but was forced to relinquish it in favour of George\r\n    Nevill, son of the Earl of Salisbury, a young man of only\r\n    three-and-twenty years of age. Godwin _de Præsulibus_. Le Neve’s\r\n    _Fasti_. Nicolas’s _Privy Council Proceedings_, vi. 265.]\r\n\r\nThat one out of the number of those great lords who had been attached to\r\nthe government of the queen and the Duke of Somerset should thus have\r\nabused his local influence, was pretty much what might have been\r\nexpected at such a juncture. But the effect was only to strengthen the\r\nhands of York when Parliament met again in November. The situation was\r\nnow once more what it had been in the beginning of the previous year.\r\nThe day before Parliament met, the Duke of York obtained a commission to\r\nact as the king’s lieutenant on its assembling.[166-2] The warrant for\r\nthe issuing of this commission was signed by no less than thirty-nine\r\nLords of the Council. The Houses then met under the presidency of the\r\nduke.[166-3] The Commons sent a deputation to the Upper House, to\r\npetition the Lords that they would ‘be good means to the King’s\r\nHighness’ for the appointment of some person to undertake the defence of\r\nthe realm and the repressing of disorders. But for some days this\r\nrequest remained unanswered. The appeal was renewed by the Commons a\r\nsecond time, and again a third time, with an intimation that no other\r\nbusiness would be attended to till it was answered. [Sidenote: York\r\nagain Protector.] On the second occasion the Lords named the Duke of\r\nYork Protector, but he desired that they would excuse him, and elect\r\nsome other. The Lords, however, declined to alter their choice, and the\r\nduke at last agreed to accept the office, on certain specific conditions\r\nwhich experience had taught him to make still more definite for his own\r\nprotection than those on which he had before insisted. Among other\r\nthings it was now agreed that the Protectorship should not again be\r\nterminated by the mere fact of the king’s recovery; but that when the\r\nking should be in a position to exercise his functions, the Protector\r\nshould be discharged of his office in Parliament by the advice of the\r\nLords Spiritual and Temporal.[167-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 166-2: _Rolls of Parl._ v. 285.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 166-3: _Privy Council Proceedings_, vi. 262.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 167-1: _Rolls of Parl._ v. 285-7.]\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of November, accordingly, York was formally appointed\r\nProtector for the second time. Three days afterwards, at Westminster,\r\nthe king, whose infirmity on this occasion could scarcely have amounted\r\nto absolute loss of his faculties, committed the entire government of\r\nthe kingdom to his Council, merely desiring that they would inform him\r\nof anything they might think fit to determine touching the honour and\r\nsurety of his person.[167-2] The business of the nation was again placed\r\non something like a stable and satisfactory footing; and Parliament,\r\nafter sitting till the 13th December, was prorogued to the 14th January,\r\nin order that the Duke of York might go down into the west for the\r\nrepressing of those disorders of which we have already spoken.[167-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 167-2: _Ibid._ v. 288-90.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 167-3: _Ibid._ 321.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1456.] Unluckily, things did not remain long in a\r\ncondition so hopeful for the restoration of order. Early in the\r\nfollowing year the king recovered his health, and notwithstanding the\r\nsupport of which he had been assured in Parliament, York knew that his\r\nauthority as Protector would be taken from him. On the 9th of February,\r\nas we learn from a letter of John Bocking, it had been anticipated that\r\nhe would have received his discharge in Parliament; but he was allowed\r\nto retain office for a fortnight longer. On that day he and Warwick\r\nthought fit to come to the Parliament with a company of 300 armed men,\r\nalleging that they stood in danger of being waylaid upon the road. The\r\npretence does not seem to have been generally credited; and the\r\npractical result of this demonstration was simply to prevent any other\r\nlords from going to the Parliament at all.[167-4]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 167-4: No. 322.]\r\n\r\nThe real question, however, which had to be considered was the kind of\r\ngovernment that should prevail when York was no more Protector. The\r\nqueen was again making anxious efforts to get the management of affairs\r\ninto her own hands; but the battle of St. Albans had deprived her of her\r\ngreat ally the Duke of Somerset, and there was no one now to fill his\r\nplace. It is true he had left a son who was now Duke of Somerset in his\r\nstead, and quite as much attached to her interests. There were,\r\nmoreover, the Duke of Buckingham and others who were by no means\r\nfriendly to the Duke of York. But no man possessed anything like the\r\ndegree of power, experience, and political ability to enable the king to\r\ndispense entirely with the services of his present Protector. The king\r\nhimself, it was said, desired that he should be named his Chief\r\nCouncillor and Lieutenant, and that powers should be conferred upon him\r\nby patent inferior only to those given him by the Parliament. But this\r\nwas not thought a likely settlement, and no one really knew what was to\r\nbe the new _régime_. The attention of the Lords was occupied with ‘a\r\ngreat gleaming star’ which had just made its appearance, and which\r\nreally offered as much help to the solution of the enigma as any\r\nappearances purely mundane and political.[168-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 168-1: No. 322.]\r\n\r\nAt length on the 25th of February the Lords exonerated York from his\r\nduties as Protector; soon after which, if not on the same day,\r\nParliament must have been dissolved.[168-2] [Sidenote: Again\r\ndischarged.] An Act of Resumption, rendered necessary by the state of\r\nthe revenue, was the principal fruit of its deliberations.[168-3] The\r\nfinances of the kingdom were placed, if not in a sound, at least in a\r\nmore hopeful condition than before; and Parliament and the Protector\r\nwere both dismissed, without, apparently, the slightest provision being\r\nmade for the future conduct of affairs. Government, in fact, seems\r\nalmost to have fallen into abeyance. There is a most striking blank in\r\nthe records of the Privy Council from the end of January 1456 to the end\r\nof November 1457. That some councils were held during this period we\r\nknow from other evidences;[168-4] but with the exception of one single\r\noccasion, when it was necessary to issue a commission for the trial of\r\ninsurgents in Kent,[169-1] there is not a single record left to tell us\r\nwhat was done at them.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 168-2: _Rolls of Parl._ v. 321.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 168-3: _Ibid._ 300. A more sweeping bill for this\r\n    purpose, which was rejected by the Lords, states that the revenue\r\n    was so encumbered ‘that the charge of every sheriff in substance\r\n    exceedeth so far the receipt of the revenues thereof due and\r\n    leviable to you (_i.e._ the king), that no person of goodwill dare\r\n    take upon him to be sheriff in any shire, for the most party, in\r\n    this land.’ _Ibid._ 328. Additional illustrations of this fact\r\n    will be found in Nicolas’s _Privy Council Proceedings_, vi. 263-4,\r\n    272-3, and Preface lxxv-vi.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 168-4: Nos. 334, 345, 348.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 169-1: _Privy Council Proceedings_, vi. 287.]\r\n\r\nYet the machine of state still moved, no one could tell exactly how.\r\nActs were done in the king’s name if not really and truly by the king,\r\nand by the sheer necessity of the case York appears to have had the\r\nordering of all things. But his authority hung by a thread. His acts\r\nwere without the slightest legal validity except in so far as they might\r\nbe considered as having the sanction of the king; and in whatever way\r\nthat sanction may or may not have been expressed, there was no security\r\nthat it would not afterwards be withdrawn and disavowed.\r\n\r\nAnd so indeed it happened at this time in a matter that concerned deeply\r\nthe honour of the whole country. The outbreak of civil war had provoked\r\nthe interference of an enemy of whom Englishmen were always peculiarly\r\nintolerant. The Duke of Somerset slain at St. Albans was uncle to James\r\nII., the reigning king of Scotland, who is said to have resented his\r\ndeath on the ground of consanguinity. [Sidenote: The King of Scots.] In\r\nless than six weeks after the battle, ‘the King of Scots with the red\r\nface,’ as he is called in a contemporary chronicle, laid siege to\r\nBerwick both by water and land. But the Bishop of Durham, the Earl of\r\nNorthumberland, and other Lords of the Marches, took prompt measures for\r\nthe relief of the town, and soon assembled such a force as to compel\r\nJames not only to quit the siege but to leave all his ordnance and\r\nvictuals behind him.[169-2] How matters stood between the two countries\r\nduring the next ten months we have no precise information; but it is\r\nclear that England, although the injured party, could not have been\r\nanxious to turn the occasion into one of open rupture. Peace still\r\ncontinued to be preserved till, on the 10th of May 1456, James wrote to\r\nthe King of England by Lyon herald, declaring that the truce of 1453 was\r\ninjurious to his kingdom, and that unless more favourable conditions\r\nwere conceded to him he would have recourse to arms.[169-3] A message\r\nmore calculated to fire the spirit of the English nation it would have\r\nbeen impossible for James to write; nevertheless, owing either to\r\nHenry’s love of peace, or to his lack of advisers after his own mind, it\r\nwas not till the 26th of July that any answer was returned to it. On\r\nthat day the Duke of York obtained, or took, the liberty of replying in\r\nHenry’s name. To the insolence of the King of Scots, he opposed all the\r\nhaughtiness that might have been expected from the most warlike of\r\nHenry’s ancestors. Insisting to the fullest extent on those claims of\r\nfeudal superiority which England never had abandoned and Scotland never\r\nhad acknowledged, he told James that his conduct was mere insolence and\r\ntreason in a vassal against his lord; that it inspired not the slightest\r\ndread but only contempt on the part of England; and that measures would\r\nbe speedily taken to punish his presumption.[170-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 169-2: _Three Fifteenth Century Chronicles_, 70 (edited\r\n    by me for the Camden Society): _Privy Council Proceedings_, vi.\r\n    248-9.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 169-3: Lambeth MS. 211, f. 146 b.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 170-1: Lambeth MS. 211, f. 147. Rymer, xi. 383.]\r\n\r\nA month later the Duke of York addressed a letter to James in his own\r\nname, declaring that as he understood the Scotch king had entered\r\nEngland, he purposed to go and meet him. He at the same time reproached\r\nJames with conduct unworthy of one who was ‘called a mighty Prince and a\r\ncourageous knight,’ in making daily forays and suddenly retiring\r\nagain.[170-2] The end of this expedition we do not know; but we know\r\nthat not long afterwards Henry changed his policy. The letter written by\r\nthe Duke of York in the king’s name was regularly enrolled on the Scotch\r\nRoll among the records of Chancery; but to it was prefixed a note on the\r\nking’s behalf, disclaiming responsibility for its tenor, and attributing\r\nto the duke the usurpation of authority, and the disturbance of all\r\ngovernment since the time of Jack Cade’s insurrection.[170-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 170-2: Lambeth MS. 211, f. 148. This letter is dated\r\n    24th August 1456.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 170-3: Rymer, xi. 383.]\r\n\r\nThe glimpses of light which we have on the political situation during\r\nthis period are far from satisfactory. Repeated notice, however, is\r\ntaken in these letters of a fact which seems significant of general\r\ndistrust and mutual suspicion among the leading persons in the land. The\r\nking, queen, and lords were all separated and kept carefully at a\r\ndistance from each other. Thus, while the king was at Sheen, the queen\r\nand her infant prince were staying at Tutbury, the Duke of York at\r\nSandal, and the Earl of Warwick at Warwick.[171-1] Afterwards we find\r\nthe queen removed to Chester, while the Duke of Buckingham was at\r\nWrittle, near Chelmsford in Essex. The only lord with the king at Sheen\r\nwas his half-brother the Earl of Pembroke. His other brother, the Earl\r\nof Richmond, who died in the course of this year, was in Wales making\r\nwar upon some chieftain of the country whose name seems rather\r\nambiguous. ‘My Lord [of] York,’ it is said, ‘is at Sendall still, and\r\nwaiteth on the queen, and she on him.’[171-2] The state of matters was\r\nevidently such that it was apprehended serious outrages might break out;\r\nand reports were even spread abroad of a battle in which Lord Beaumont\r\nhad been slain and the Earl of Warwick severely wounded.[171-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 171-1: Nos. 330, 331.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 171-2: No. 334.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 171-3: No. 331.]\r\n\r\n  [[Earl of Warwick severely wounded.[171-3]\r\n  _text has superfluous close quote_]]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The king and queen.] The separation of the king and queen is\r\nespecially remarkable. During May and June they were more than a hundred\r\nmiles apart; and in the latter month the queen had increased the\r\ndistance by removing from Tutbury in Staffordshire to Chester. It was\r\nthen that she was said to be waiting on my Lord of York and he on her.\r\nThe exact interpretation of the position must be partly matter of\r\nconjecture, but I take it to be as follows. The Duke of York, as we find\r\nstated only a few months later, was in very good favour with the king\r\nbut not with the queen;[171-4] and we know from Fabyan that the latter\r\nwas at this time doing all she could to put an end to his authority. It\r\nappears to me that by her influence the duke must have been ordered to\r\nwithdraw from the Court, and that to prevent his again seeking access to\r\nthe king’s presence, she pursued him into the north. At Tutbury[171-5]\r\nshe would block his way from Sandal up to London; and though for some\r\nreason or other she removed further off to Chester, she still kept an\r\nanxious watch upon the duke, and he did the same on her. Very probably\r\nher removal did give him the opportunity she dreaded of moving\r\nsouthwards; for he must have been with the king at Windsor on the 26th\r\nof July when he wrote in Henry’s name that answer to the King of Scots\r\nof which we have already spoken.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 171-4: No. 348.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 171-5: Tutbury was one of the possessions given to her\r\n    for her dower. _Rolls of Parl._ vi. 118.]\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, Margaret soon after had recourse to other means to\r\neffect her object. In consequence of the Duke of York’s popularity in\r\nLondon, it was expedient to remove the king some distance from the\r\ncapital.[172-1] He appears to have been staying at Windsor during July\r\nand the beginning of August. In the middle of the latter month he took\r\nhis departure northwards. By the dates of his Privy Seals we find him to\r\nhave been at Wycombe on the 18th, at Kenilworth on the 24th, and at\r\nLichfield on the 29th. In September he moved about between Lichfield,\r\nCoventry, and Leicester; but by the beginning of October the Court seems\r\nto have settled itself at Coventry, where a council was assembled on the\r\n7th.[172-2] To this council the Duke of York and his friends were\r\nregularly summoned, as well as the lords whom the queen intended to\r\nhonour; but even before it met, changes had begun to be made in the\r\nprincipal officers of state. On the 5th, Viscount Bourchier, the brother\r\nof the Archbishop of Canterbury, was dismissed from his office of Lord\r\nTreasurer, and the Earl of Shrewsbury was appointed in his room. On the\r\n11th, the archbishop himself was called upon to surrender the Great\r\nSeal, and Waynflete, Bishop of Winchester, was made Chancellor in his\r\nstead. Laurence Booth, afterwards Bishop of Durham, was made Lord Privy\r\nSeal.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 172-1: Fabyan.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 172-2: No. 345.]\r\n\r\nThe new appointments seem to have been on their own merits\r\nunexceptionable,--that of Waynflete more especially. Whether the\r\nsuperiority of the new men was such as to make it advisable to supersede\r\nthe old is another question, on which we would not attempt to pronounce\r\nan opinion, either one way or other. One thing, however, we may believe\r\non the evidence of James Gresham, whose letters frequently give us very\r\ninteresting political intelligence: the changes created dissatisfaction\r\nin some of the queen’s own friends, particularly in the Duke of\r\nBuckingham, who was half-brother to two of the discharged functionaries,\r\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury and Viscount Bourchier. Either from this\r\ncause or from a mere English love of fair-play, it would appear that\r\nBuckingham now supported the Duke of York, who, it is said, though at\r\nthis time he had some interviews with the king and found Henry still as\r\nfriendly as he could desire, would certainly have been troubled at his\r\ndeparture if Buckingham had not befriended him. About the Court there\r\nwas a general atmosphere of suspicion and distrust. On the 11th October,\r\nthe very day on which Waynflete was appointed Chancellor, an encounter\r\ntook place between the Duke of Somerset’s men and the watchmen of the\r\ncity of Coventry, in which two or three of the citizens were killed. And\r\nprobably it would have gone hard with the duke’s retainers, had not\r\nBuckingham used his good offices here too as peacemaker; for the\r\nalarm-bell rang and the citizens rose in arms. But by the interposition\r\nof Buckingham the tumult was appeased.[173-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 173-1: No. 348.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1457.] For about a twelvemonth from this time we find\r\nthat the Court continued generally at Coventry,[173-2] occasionally\r\nmoving about to Stafford, Coleshill, Chester, Shrewsbury, Kenilworth,\r\nHereford, and Leicester.[173-3] The queen evidently feared all the while\r\nto bring her husband nearer London, lest he should fall once more under\r\nthe power of the Duke of York. Meanwhile the want of a vigorous ruler\r\nbecame every day more apparent. Not only was Calais again in danger of\r\nsiege,[173-4] but the coast of Kent was attacked by enemies, and within\r\nthe kingdom a dangerous spirit of disaffection had shown itself in\r\nvarious places. On the Patent Rolls we meet with numerous commissions\r\nfor keeping watch upon the coasts,[173-5] for arraying the country\r\nagainst invasion,[173-6] and for assembling the _posse comitatus_ in\r\nvarious counties, against treasonable attempts to stir up the\r\npeople.[173-7] During April the Court had removed to Hereford,[174-1]\r\napparently in consequence of some disturbances which had taken place in\r\nWales under Sir William Herbert. Its sojourn upon the Welsh borders had\r\nan excellent effect, the burgesses and gentlemen about Hereford all\r\ndeclaring themselves ready to take the king’s part unless a peace were\r\nmade. On the 1st of May it was reported in London that Herbert had\r\noffered, on being granted his life and goods, to return to his\r\nallegiance and appear before the king and lords at Leicester; so we may\r\nconclude the insurrection did not last long after.[174-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 173-2: Accounts of the pageants shown before Queen\r\n    Margaret at Coventry are noticed as contained in the earliest Leet\r\n    Book of the City.

By the 4th of May the king had left\r\n    Hereford and gone to Worcester, from which he proceeded to\r\n    Winchcombe on the 10th and Kenilworth on the 13th. (Privy Seal\r\n    dates.)]\r\n\r\nBut though the personal influence of the king was doubtless great and\r\nbeneficial within his own immediate vicinity, it could do little for the\r\ngood order and protection of the country generally. Distrust,\r\nexclusiveness, and a bankrupt exchequer were not likely to obtain for\r\nthe king willing and hearty service. Notwithstanding the commissions\r\nissued to keep watch upon the coasts, the French managed to surprise and\r\nplunder Sandwich. [Sidenote: The French attack Sandwich.] On Sunday, the\r\n28th August, a large force under the command of Pierre de Brézé,\r\nseneschal of Normandy, landed not far from the town, which they took and\r\nkept possession of during the entire day. A number of the inhabitants,\r\non the first alarm, retreated on board some ships lying in the harbour,\r\nfrom whence they began presently to shoot at the enemy. But de Brézé\r\nhaving warned them that if they continued he would burn their ships,\r\nthey found it prudent to leave off. Having killed the bailiffs and\r\nprincipal officers, the Frenchmen carried off a number of wealthy\r\npersons as prisoners, and returned to their ships in the evening, laden\r\nwith valuable spoils from the town and neighbourhood.[174-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 174-3: _English Chronicle_ (Davies), 74. _Three\r\n    Fifteenth Century Chronicles_, 70, 71, 152-3. _Contin. of\r\n    Monstrelet_, 70, 71.]\r\n\r\nThe disaster must have been keenly felt; but if Englishmen had known the\r\nwhole truth, it would have been felt more keenly still. Our own old\r\nhistorians were not aware of the fact, but an early French chronicler\r\nwho lived at the time assures us that the attack had been purposely\r\ninvited by Margaret of Anjou out of hatred to the Duke of York, in order\r\nto make a diversion, while the Scots should ravage England![175-1] It\r\nwas well for her that the truth was not suspected.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 175-1: De Coussy, 209.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reconciliation and Civil War_\r\n\r\nAt length, it would seem, the Court found it no longer possible to\r\nremain at a distance from the metropolis. In October the king had\r\nremoved to Chertsey,[175-2] and soon after we find him presiding at a\r\nGreat Council, which had been summoned to meet in his palace at\r\nWestminster in consequence of the urgent state of affairs. Though\r\nattended not only by the Duke of York, but by a large number of the\r\nprincipal lords on both sides, the meeting does not appear to have led\r\nto any very satisfactory results. All that we know of its proceedings is\r\nthat some of them, at least, were of a stormy character,--one point on\r\nwhich all parties were agreed being the exclusion from the council\r\nchamber of Pecock, [Sidenote: Bishop Pecock.] Bishop of Chichester, an\r\nardent and honest-minded prelate, who, having laboured hard to reconcile\r\nthe Lollards to the authority of the Church by arguments of common sense\r\ninstead of persecution, was at this time stigmatised as a heretic and\r\nsedition-monger, and very soon after was deprived of his bishopric. It\r\naugured little good for that union of parties which was now felt to be\r\nnecessary for the public weal, that the first act on which men generally\r\ncould be got to agree was the persecution of sense and reason. There\r\nwere other matters before the council on which they were unable to come\r\nto a conclusion, and they broke up on the 29th November, with a\r\nresolution to meet again on the 27th January; for which meeting\r\nsummonses were at once sent out, notifying that on that day not one of\r\nthe lords would be excused attendance.[175-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 175-2: Privy Seal dates.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 175-3: _Privy Council Proceedings_, vi. 290-1.]\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, particularly important that this meeting should be a\r\nfull one, and that every lord should be compelled to take his share of\r\nthe responsibility for its decisions. The principal aim was expressly\r\nstated to be a general reconciliation and adjustment of private\r\ncontroversies[176-1]--an object to which it was impossible to offer\r\ndirect opposition. But whether it was really distasteful to a number of\r\nthe peers, or obstacles started up in individual cases, there were\r\ncertainly several who had not arrived in town by the day appointed for\r\nthe meeting. [Sidenote: A.D. 1458.] The Earl of Salisbury’s excuse,\r\ndated at Sheriff Hutton on the 24th of January,[176-2] does not refer to\r\nthis, for it appears certainly to be of a different year. Fabyan says\r\nthat he had already arrived in London on the 15th January. He made his\r\nappearance there at the head of 400 horse, with eighty knights and\r\nsquires in his company. The Duke of York also came, though he arrived\r\nonly on the 26th, ‘with his own household only, to the number of 140\r\nhorse.’ But the Duke of Somerset only arrived on the last day of the\r\nmonth with 200 horse; the Duke of Exeter delayed his coming till the\r\nfirst week of February; and the Earl of Warwick, who had to come from\r\nCalais, was detained by contrary winds. Thus, although the king had come\r\nup to Westminster by the time prefixed, a full Council could not be had\r\nfor at least some days after; and even on the 14th of February there was\r\none absentee, the Earl of Arundel, who had to be written to by letters\r\nof Privy Seal.[176-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 176-1: _Privy Council Proceedings_, vi. 293.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 176-2: No. 361.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 176-3: No. 364. _Privy Council Proceedings_, vi. 293.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Great Council in London.] But by the 14th Warwick had\r\narrived in London with a body of 600 men, ‘all apparelled in red\r\njackets, with white ragged staves.’[176-4] The town was now full of the\r\nretinues of the different noblemen, and the mayor and sheriffs trembled\r\nfor the peace of the city. A very special watch was instituted. ‘The\r\nmayor,’ says Fabyan, ‘for so long as the king and the lords lay thus in\r\nthe city, had daily in harness 5000 citizens, and rode daily about the\r\ncity and suburbs of the same, to see that the king’s peace were kept;\r\nand nightly he provided for 3000 men in harness to give attendance upon\r\nthree aldermen, and they to keep the night-watch till 7 of the clock\r\nupon the morrow, till the day-watch were assembled.’ If peace was to be\r\nthe result of all this concourse, the settlement evidently could not\r\nbear to be protracted. The Duke of York and the Earls of Salisbury and\r\nWarwick had taken up their quarters within the city itself; but the\r\nyoung lords whose fathers had been slain at St. Albans--the Duke of\r\nSomerset, the Earl of Northumberland and his brother, Lord Egremont, and\r\nthe Lord Clifford--were believed to be bent upon revenge, and the civic\r\nauthorities refused them entrance within their bounds.[177-1] Thus the\r\nlords within the town and those without belonged to the two opposite\r\nparties respectively; and in consequence of their mutual jealousies,\r\nconferences had to be arranged between them in the morning at the Black\r\nFriars, and in the afternoon at the White Friars, in Fleet\r\nStreet.[177-2] The king, for his part, having opened the proceedings\r\nwith some very earnest exhortations addressed to both parties, withdrew\r\nhimself and retired to Berkhampstead.[177-3] The Duke of Somerset and\r\nothers went to and fro to consult with him during the deliberations.\r\nMeanwhile the necessity of some practical arrangement for government\r\nmust have been felt more urgent every day. Sixty sail of Frenchmen were\r\nseen off the coast of Sussex; and though Lord Falconbridge was at\r\nSouthampton in command of some vessels (probably on his own\r\nresponsibility), there was a general feeling of insecurity among the\r\nmerchants and among dwellers by the sea-coast. Botoner had heard\r\nprivately from Calais that the French meditated a descent upon Norfolk\r\nat Cromer and Blakeney.[177-4] And the news shortly afterwards received\r\nfrom the district showed that his information was not far wrong.[177-5]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 176-4: _Chronicle_ in MS. Cott., Vitell. A. xvi.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 177-1: _English Chronicle_ (ed. Davies), p. 77. Hall.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 177-2: Letter 366.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 177-3: Whethamstede, 417-18. Letter 365.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 177-4: Letter 365.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 177-5: Letter 366.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Terms of agreement.] At last it was agreed on both sides that\r\nold animosities should be laid aside, and that some reparation should be\r\nmade by the Yorkists to the sons and widows of the lords who had fallen\r\non the king’s side at St. Albans. The exact amount of this reparation\r\nwas left to the award of Henry, who decided that it should consist of an\r\nendowment of £45 a year to the Monastery of St. Albans, to be employed\r\nin masses for the slain, and of certain money payments, or assignments\r\nout of moneys due to them by the Crown, to be made by York, Warwick, and\r\nSalisbury, to Eleanor, Duchess Dowager of Somerset and to her son, Duke\r\nHenry, to Lord Clifford, and others, in lieu of all claims and actions\r\nwhich the latter parties might have against the former.[178-1] With what\r\ncordiality this arrangement was accepted on either side we do not\r\npresume to say. Historians universally speak of it as a hollow concord,\r\nunreal from the first. But it at least preserved the kingdom in\r\nsomething like peace for about a twelvemonth. It was celebrated by a\r\ngreat procession to St. Paul’s on Lady Day, which must have been an\r\nimposing spectacle. The king marched in royal habit with the crown upon\r\nhis head, York and the queen followed, arm in arm, and the principal\r\nrivals led the way, walking hand in hand.[178-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 178-1: Whethamstede, 422 _sq._ _Engl. Chron._ (Davies),\r\n    77, 78.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 178-2: Hall.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A sea fight.] The keeping of the sea was now intrusted to the\r\nEarl of Warwick, and it was not long before he distinguished himself by\r\nan action which probably relieved the English coasts for some time from\r\nany immediate danger of being attacked by the enemy. On the morning of\r\nTrinity Sunday word was brought to him at Calais of a fleet of 28\r\nSpaniards, of which 16 were described as ‘great ships of forecastle.’\r\nImmediately he manned such vessels as he had in readiness, and went out\r\nto seek the enemy. The force at his command was only five ships of\r\nforecastle, three carvels, and four pinnaces; but with these he did not\r\nhesitate to come to an engagement. At four o’clock on Monday morning the\r\nbattle began, and it continued till ten, when the English obtained a\r\nhard-won victory. ‘As men say,’ wrote one of the combatants, ‘there was\r\nnot so great a battle upon the sea this forty winter; and forsooth, we\r\nwere well and truly beat.’ Nevertheless, six of the enemy’s ships were\r\ntaken, and the rest were put to flight, not without very considerable\r\nslaughter on either side.[178-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 178-3: Letter 369. Compare Fabyan. Whethamstede, who\r\n    writes with some confusion in this part of his narrative, speaks\r\n    of a great naval victory won by Warwick on St. Alban’s Day, the\r\n    22nd June 1459, over a fleet of Genoese and Spanish vessels, in\r\n    which booty was taken to the value of £10,000, and upwards of a\r\n    thousand prisoners, for whom it was difficult to find room in all\r\n    the prisons of Calais. It is not impossible that this may have\r\n    been a different action, which took place on the very day, month,\r\n    and year to which Whethamstede refers it; but the silence of other\r\n    authorities about a second naval victory would lead us to suppose\r\n    he is simply wrong in the matter of date. It must be observed that\r\n    Whethamstede immediately goes on to speak of the Legate Coppini’s\r\n    arrival in England, which took place in June 1460, as having\r\n    happened _circa idem tempus_, and as if it had been in the same\r\n    month of June, only a few days earlier. This shows great\r\n    inaccuracy.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1459.] In the year following, the fire that had for some\r\ntime smouldered, burst once more into a flame. About Candlemas,\r\naccording to Fabyan--but an older authority says specifically on the 9th\r\nNovember preceding[179-1]--a fray occurred between one of the king’s\r\nservants and one of the Earl of Warwick’s, as the earl, who had been\r\nattending the Council at Westminster, was proceeding to his barge. The\r\nking’s servant being wounded, the other made his escape; but a host of\r\nretainers attached to the royal household rushed out upon the earl and\r\nhis attendants, and wounded several of them before they could embark.\r\nWith hard rowing they got beyond the power of their assailants and made\r\ntheir way into the city; but the queen and her friends insisted on\r\nimputing the outrage to the earl himself, and demanded his arrest. The\r\nearl found it politic to retire to Warwick, and afterwards to his former\r\npost at Calais. On this the queen and her council turned their\r\nmachinations against his father, the Earl of Salisbury, whom Lord Audley\r\nwas commissioned to arrest and bring prisoner to London. Audley\r\naccordingly took with him a large body of men, and hearing that the earl\r\nwas on his way from Middleham in Yorkshire, journeying either towards\r\nSalisbury or London, he hastened to intercept him. [Sidenote: Civil war\r\nrenewed.] The earl, however, had received notice of what was intended,\r\nand having gathered about him a sufficient band of followers, defeated\r\nLord Audley in a regular pitched battle at Bloreheath in Staffordshire,\r\nwhere he attempted to stop his way, on Sunday the 23rd of\r\nSeptember.[179-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 179-1: _Engl. Chron._ (Davies), 78.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 179-2: Fabyan, _Engl. Chron._ (Davies), 80. _Parl.\r\n    Rolls_, v. 348.]\r\n\r\nThe old elements of confusion were now again let loose. Commissions to\r\nraise men were issued in the king’s name, and the Duke of York and all\r\nhis friends were denounced as a confederacy of traitors. They, for their\r\nparts, gathered together the men of the Marches in self-defence. At\r\nLudlow, the duke was joined by the Earl of Salisbury, and also by the\r\nEarl of Warwick, who had come over again from Calais. [Sidenote: The\r\nking takes the field.] On the other hand, the king himself entered into\r\nthe strife in a way he had not done hitherto. He not only took the field\r\nin person against the rebellious lords, but exhibited a spirit in the\r\nendurance of fatigue and discomfort which seems to have commanded\r\ngeneral admiration. Even at the time of Lord Audley’s overthrow, it\r\nwould appear that he was leading forward a reserve. For about a month he\r\nkept continually camping out, never resting at night, except on Sundays,\r\nin the same place he had occupied the night before, and sometimes, in\r\nspite of cold, rough weather, bivouacking for two nights successively on\r\nthe bare field. After the battle of Bloreheath, he could only regard\r\nSalisbury as an overt enemy of his crown. At the same time he despatched\r\nheralds to the Duke of York and the Earl of Warwick, with proclamations\r\nof free and perfect pardon to themselves and all but a few of the\r\nleaders at Bloreheath, on condition of their submitting to him within\r\nsix days.[180-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 180-1: _Rolls of Parl._ vi. 348.]\r\n\r\nTo Garter King of Arms, one of the messengers by whom these offers were\r\nconveyed, the confederate lords made answer, and also delivered a\r\nwritten reply to be conveyed to the king, declaring the perfect loyalty\r\nof their intentions, which they would have been glad to prove in the\r\nking’s presence if it had been only possible for them to go to him with\r\nsafety. They had already endeavoured to testify their unshaken fidelity\r\nto Henry by an indenture drawn up and signed by them in Worcester\r\nCathedral. This instrument they had forwarded to the king by a\r\ndeputation of churchmen, headed by the prior of that cathedral, and\r\nincluding among others Dr. William Lynwoode,[180-2] who administered to\r\nthem the sacrament on the occasion. Again, after Garter left, they wrote\r\nfrom Ludlow on the 10th of October, protesting that their actions had\r\nbeen misconstrued, and their tenants subjected to wrong and violence,\r\nwhile they themselves lay under unjust suspicion. Their enemies, they\r\nsaid, thirsted for the possession of their lands, and hoped to obtain\r\nthem by their influence with the king. For their own part they had\r\nhitherto avoided a conflict, not from any fear of the power of their\r\nenemies, but only for dread of God and of his Highness, and they meant\r\nto persevere in this peaceful course, until driven by necessity to\r\nself-defence.[181-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 180-2: Not, as Stow supposes, the author of the book on\r\n    the Constitutions of the Church of England, but probably a nephew\r\n    or other relation of his. The William Lynwoode who wrote upon the\r\n    Church Constitutions was Bishop of St. David’s, and died in 1446.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 181-1: _Engl. Chron._ (Davies), 81, 82.]\r\n\r\nThese earnest, solemn, and repeated expressions of loyalty have\r\nscarcely, I think, received from historians the attention to which they\r\nare entitled.[181-2] Of their sincerity, of course, men may form\r\ndifferent opinions; but it is right to note that the confederate lords\r\nhad done all that was in their power by three several and distinct\r\nprotests to induce the king to think more favourably of their\r\nintentions. It is, moreover, to be observed that they remained at this\r\ntime in an attitude strictly defensive. But the king and his forces\r\nstill approaching, they drew themselves up in battle array at Ludford,\r\nin the immediate vicinity of the town of Ludlow. Here, as they were\r\nposted on Friday the 12th October, it would almost seem that the lords\r\nwere not without apprehension of the defection of some of their\r\nfollowers. A report was spread through the camp that the king was\r\nsuddenly deceased, witnesses were brought in who swore to the fact, and\r\nmass was said for the repose of his soul. But that very evening, Henry,\r\nat the head of his army, arrived within half a mile of their position.\r\nThe state of the country, flooded by recent rains, had alone prevented\r\nhim from coming upon them sooner. Before nightfall a few volleys of\r\nartillery were discharged against the royal army, and a regular\r\nengagement was expected next day. But, meanwhile, the royal proclamation\r\nof pardon seems to have had its effect. One Andrew Trollope, who had\r\ncome over with the Earl of Warwick from Calais, withdrew at dead of\r\nnight and carried over a considerable body of men to the service of the\r\nking, to whom he communicated the secrets of the camp. The blow was\r\nabsolutely fatal. [Sidenote: The Yorkists disperse.] The lords at once\r\nabandoned all thought of further resistance. Leaving their banners in\r\nthe field, they withdrew at midnight. York and his second son, Edmund,\r\nEarl of Rutland, fled into Wales, from whence they sailed into Ireland.\r\nHis eldest, Edward, Earl of March, accompanied by the two other earls,\r\nWarwick and Salisbury, and by Sir John Wenlock, made his way into\r\nDevonshire. There by the friendly aid of one John Dynham, afterwards\r\nLord Dynham, and Lord High Treasurer to Henry VII., they bought a ship\r\nat Exmouth and sailed to Guernsey. At last, on Friday the 2nd of\r\nNovember, they landed at Calais, where they met with a most cordial\r\nreception from the inhabitants.[182-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 181-2: The Act of Attainder against the Yorkists most\r\n    untruly says, ‘they took no consideration’ of Garter’s message.\r\n    See _Rolls of Parliament_ above cited.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 182-1: _Rolls of Parl._ vi. 348-9. Whethamstede,\r\n    459-62; Fabyan.]\r\n\r\n  [[a most cordial reception from the inhabitants.[182-1]\r\n  _footnote tag missing: supplied from 1st edition_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: They are attainted.] Then followed in November the Parliament\r\nof Coventry, and the attainder of the Duke of York and all his party.\r\nThe queen and her friends at last had it all their own way, at least in\r\nEngland. It was otherwise doubtless in Ireland, where the Duke of York\r\nremained for nearly a twelvemonth after his flight from Ludlow. It was\r\notherwise too at Calais, where Warwick was all-powerful, and whither\r\ndiscontented Yorkists began to flock from England. It was otherwise,\r\nmoreover, at sea, where the same Warwick still retained the command of\r\nthe fleet, and could not be dispossessed, except on parchment. On\r\nparchment, however, he was presently superseded in both of his important\r\noffices. The Duke of Exeter was intrusted with the keeping of the sea,\r\nwhich even at the time of the great reconciliation of parties he had\r\nbeen displeased that Warwick was allowed to retain.[182-2] The young\r\nDuke of Somerset was appointed Captain of Calais, but was unable to take\r\npossession of his post. Accompanied by Lord Roos and Lord Audley, and\r\nfortified by the king’s letters-patent, he crossed the sea, but was\r\nrefused admittance into the town. Apparently he had put off too long\r\nbefore going over,[183-1] and he found the three earls in possession of\r\nthe place before him; so that he was obliged to land at a place called\r\nScales’ Cliff and go to Guisnes.[183-2] But a worse humiliation still\r\nawaited him on landing; for of the very sailors that had brought him\r\nover, a number conveyed their ships into Calais harbour, offered their\r\nservices to the Earl of Warwick, and placed in his hands as prisoners\r\ncertain persons who had taken part against him. They were shortly after\r\nbeheaded in Calais.[183-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 182-2: W. Worc., 479.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 183-1: He received his appointment on the 9th October,\r\n    three days before the dispersion of the Yorkists at Ludlow (Rymer,\r\n    xi. 436), and, according to one authority (_Engl. Chron._, ed.\r\n    Davies, 84), he went over in the same month; but as all agree that\r\n    Warwick was there before him, it was more probably in the\r\n    beginning of November.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 183-2: _Chronicle_ in MS. Cott., Vitell. A. xvi.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 183-3: Fabyan.]\r\n\r\nIt would seem, in short, that ever since his great naval victory in\r\n1458, Warwick was so highly popular with all the sailors of England,\r\nthat it was quite as hopeless for the Duke of Exeter to contest his\r\nsupremacy at sea as for Somerset to think of winning Calais out of his\r\nhands. Friends still came flocking over from England to join the three\r\nearls at Calais; [Sidenote: A.D. 1460.] and though in London in the\r\nFebruary following nine men were hanged, drawn, and beheaded for\r\nattempting to do so,[183-4] the cause of the Yorkists remained as\r\npopular as ever. In vain were letters written to foreign parts, ‘that no\r\nrelief be ministered to the traitor who kept Calais.’[183-5] In vain the\r\nDuke of Somerset at Guisnes endeavoured to contest his right to the\r\ngovernment of that important town. All that Somerset could do was to\r\nwaste his strength in fruitless skirmishes, until on St. George’s Day he\r\nsuffered such a severe defeat and loss of men at Newnham Bridge, that he\r\nwas at length forced to abandon all idea of dispossessing the Earl of\r\nWarwick.[183-6]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 183-4: W. Worc., 478; _Three Fifteenth Century\r\n    Chronicles_, 73. One of them was named Roger Nevile, a lawyer of\r\n    the Temple, and probably a relation of the Earl of Warwick.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 183-5: Speed.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 183-6: W. Worc.]\r\n\r\nNot only were the three earls secure in their position at Calais, but\r\nthere was every reason to believe that they had a large amount of\r\nsympathy in Kent, and would meet with a very cordial reception whenever\r\nthey crossed the sea. To avert the danger of any such attempt, and also,\r\nit would appear, with some design of reinforcing the Duke of Somerset at\r\nGuisnes, Lord Rivers and his son Sir Anthony Wydevile were sent to\r\nSandwich about the beginning of the year, with a body of 400 men.\r\nBesides the command of the town, they were commissioned to take\r\npossession of certain ships which belonged to the Earl of Warwick, and\r\nlay quietly at anchor in the harbour.[184-1] [Sidenote: Lord Rivers at\r\nSandwich.] But the issue of their exploit was such as to provoke\r\nuniversal ridicule. ‘As to tidings here,’ wrote Botoner from London to\r\nJohn Berney at Caister, ‘I send some offhand, written to you and others,\r\nhow the Lord Rivers, Sir Anthony his son, and others _have won Calais_\r\nby a feeble assault at Sandwich made by John Denham, Esq., with the\r\nnumber of 800 men, on Tuesday between four and five o’clock in the\r\nmorning.’[184-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 184-1: _Engl. Chron._ (Davies), 84, 85; _Three Fifteenth\r\n    Century Chronicles_, 72.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 184-2: Letter 399.]\r\n\r\nThe exact mode in which Rivers and his son ‘won Calais’ seems to have\r\nbeen described in a separate paper. The truth was that a small force\r\nunder the command of John Denham (or Dynham) was despatched across the\r\nsea by Warwick, and landing at Sandwich during the night, contrived not\r\nonly to seize the ships in the harbour, but even to surprise the earl\r\nand his son in their beds, and bring them over as prisoners to the other\r\nside of the Channel.[184-3] The victors did not fail to turn the\r\nincident to account by exhibiting as much contempt as possible for their\r\nunfortunate prisoners. ‘My Lord Rivers,’ writes William Paston, ‘was\r\nbrought to Calais, and before the lords with eight score torches, and\r\nthere my lord of Salisbury rated him, calling him knave’s son, that he\r\nshould be so rude to call him and those other lords traitors; for they\r\nshould be found the king’s true liegemen when he should be found a\r\ntraitor. And my Lord of Warwick rated him and said that his father was\r\nbut a squire, and brought up with King Henry V., and since made himself\r\nby marriage, and also made a lord; and that it was not his part to have\r\nsuch language of lords, being of the king’s blood. And my Lord of March\r\nrated him in like wise. And Sir Anthony was rated for his language of\r\nall the three lords in like wise.’[185-1] It must have been a curious\r\nreflection to the Earl of March when in after years, as King Edward IV.,\r\nhe married the daughter of this same Lord Rivers, that he had taken part\r\nin this vituperation of his future father-in-law!\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 184-3: W. Worc. _Engl. Chron._ (Davies), 85.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 185-1: Letter 400.]\r\n\r\nBy and by it became sufficiently evident that unless he was considerably\r\nreinforced, the Duke of Somerset could do no good at Guisnes. Instead of\r\nattempting to maintain a footing beside Calais, the queen’s Government\r\nwould have enough to do to keep the rebels out of England. The capture\r\nof Rivers had excited the most serious alarm, and the landing of Warwick\r\nhimself upon the eastern coast was looked upon as not improbable.[185-2]\r\nA new force of 500 men was accordingly sent to Sandwich under the\r\ncommand of one Osbert Mountford or Mundeford,[185-3] an old officer of\r\nCalais. His instructions were to go from Sandwich to Guisnes, either in\r\naid of the Duke of Somerset, as intimated in Worcester’s _Annals_, or,\r\naccording to another contemporary authority,[185-4] to bring him over to\r\nEngland. But while he waited for a wind to sail, John Dynham again\r\ncrossed the sea, attacked the force under the command of Mundeford, and\r\nafter a little skirmishing, in which he himself was wounded, succeeded\r\nin carrying him off to Calais, as he had before done Lord Rivers.\r\nMundeford’s treatment, however, was not so lenient as that of the more\r\nnoble captive. On the 25th of June he was beheaded at the Tower of\r\nRysebank, which stood near the town, on the opposite side of the\r\nharbour.[185-5]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 185-2: _See_ Appendix to Introduction.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 185-3: The writer of Letter 378. He was a connection of\r\n    the Paston family, having married Elizabeth, daughter of John\r\n    Berney, Esq., another of whose daughters, Margaret, was the mother\r\n    of Margaret Paston (Blomefield, ii. 182). He had been much engaged\r\n    in the king’s service in France, and had been treasurer of\r\n    Normandy before it was lost--a fact which may account for his\r\n    writing French in preference to English. _See_ Stevenson’s _Wars\r\n    of the English in France_, index.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 185-4: _Engl. Chron._ (Davies), 85.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 185-5: W. Worc., 479; Fabyan; Stow, 406-7.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Earl of Warwick did not remain at Calais. He scoured the\r\nseas with his fleet and sailed into Ireland. Sir Baldwin Fulford,\r\na knight of Devonshire, promised the king, on pain of losing his head,\r\nto destroy Warwick’s fleet; but having exhausted the sum of 1000 marks\r\nwhich was allowed him for his expenses, he returned home without having\r\nattained his object.[186-1] On the 16th of March, Warwick having met\r\nwith the Duke of York in Ireland, the two noblemen entered the harbour\r\nof Waterford with a fleet of six-and-twenty ships well manned; and on\r\nthe following day, being St. Patrick’s Day, they landed and were\r\nceremoniously received by the mayor and burgesses.[186-2] Warwick seems\r\nto have remained in Ireland more than two months, concerting with the\r\nDuke of York plans for future action. About Whitsunday, which in this\r\nyear fell on the 1st of June, his fleet was observed by the Duke of\r\nExeter off the coast of Cornwall, on its return to Calais. Exeter’s\r\nsquadron was superior in strength, and an engagement might have been\r\nexpected; but the duke was not sure that he could trust his own sailors,\r\nand he allowed the earl to pass unmolested.[186-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 186-1: _English Chron._ (Davies), 85.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 186-2: Lambeth MS. 632, f. 255.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 186-3: _Chron._ (Davies), 85; W. Worc.]\r\n\r\n  [[allowed the earl to pass unmolested.[186-3]\r\n  _footnote tag missing: supplied from 1st edition_]]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Legate Coppini.] About this time there arrived at\r\nCalais a papal nuncio, by name Francesco Coppini, Bishop of Terni,\r\nreturning from England to Rome. He had been sent by the new pope, Pius\r\nII., the ablest that had for a long time filled the pontifical chair,\r\nto urge Henry to send an ambassador to a congress at Mantua, in which\r\nmeasures were to be concerted for the union and defence of Christendom\r\nagainst the Turks. This was in the beginning of the preceding\r\nyear,[186-4] and, as he himself states, he remained nearly a year and\r\na half in England.[186-5] But the incapacity of the king, and the\r\ndissensions that prevailed among the lords, rendered his mission a total\r\nfailure. Henry, indeed, who was never wanting in reverence for the Holy\r\nSee, named a certain number of bishops and lords to go upon this\r\nmission, but they one and all refused. He accordingly sent two priests\r\nof little name, with an informal commission to excuse a greater embassy.\r\nEngland was thus discredited at the papal court, and the nuncio, finding\r\nhis mission fruitless, at last crossed the sea to return home. At\r\nCalais, however, he was persuaded by Warwick to remain. The earl himself\r\nwas about to return to England, and if the legate would come back in his\r\ncompany he might use the influence of his sacred office to heal the\r\nwounds of a divided kingdom.[187-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 186-4: His commission from the Pope is dated 7th January\r\n    1458[9]--Rymer, xi. 419.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 186-5: Brown’s _Venetian Calendar_, i. p. 91.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 187-1: Gobellinus, 161.]\r\n\r\nThe nuncio had doubtless seen enough of the deplorable condition of\r\nEngland to be convinced that peace was impossible, so long as the lords\r\nmost fit to govern were banished and proclaimed rebels by the queen and\r\nher favourites.[187-2] He was, moreover, furnished with powers, by\r\nwhich--the main object of his mission being the union of Christendom--he\r\nwas authorised to make some efforts to compose the dissensions of\r\nEngland.[187-3] But he certainly overstrained them, and allowed himself\r\nto become a partisan. Flattered by the attentions shown him by Warwick,\r\nhe acceded to his suggestion, and when, on the 26th of June,[187-4] the\r\nday after Mundeford was beheaded at Calais, the confederate lords\r\ncrossed the Channel, the nuncio was in their company, bearing the\r\nstandard of the Church. Archbishop Bourchier, too, met them at Sandwich,\r\nwhere they landed, with a great multitude of people; and with his cross\r\nborne before him, the Primate of England conducted the three earls and\r\ntheir followers, who increased in number as they went along, until they\r\nreached the capital. After a very brief opposition on the part of some\r\nof the citizens, the city opened its gates to them. They entered London\r\non the 2nd of July.[187-5]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 187-2: The Yorkists apparently were not sparing of\r\n    insinuations against the queen. It had been rumoured, according to\r\n    Fabyan, that the Prince of Wales was not really the king’s son;\r\n    but the worst that was insinuated was that he was a changeling.\r\n    But Warwick himself, according to Gobellinus, described the\r\n    situation to the nuncio as follows:--‘Rex noster stupidus est, et\r\n    mente captus; regitur, non regit; apud uxorem et qui regis\r\n    thalamum fœdant, imperium est.’]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 187-3: _See_ the Pope’s letter to him in Theiner,\r\n    423-4.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 187-4: ‘The lords crossed the sea on Thursday,’ writes\r\n    Coppini from London on the 4th July.--Brown’s _Venetian Calendar_,\r\n    i. 90.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 187-5: _Engl. Chron._ (Davies), 94.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Earls of March, Warwick, and Salisbury.] Before they\r\ncrossed the sea, the three earls had sent over a set of articles\r\naddressed to the archbishop and the commons of England in the name of\r\nthemselves and the Duke of York, declaring how they had sued in vain to\r\nbe admitted to the king’s presence to set forth certain matters that\r\nconcerned the common weal of all the land. Foremost among these was the\r\noppression of the Church, a charge based, seemingly, on facts with which\r\nwe are unacquainted, and which, if known, might shed a clearer light\r\nupon the conduct of the legate and Archbishop Bourchier. Secondly, they\r\ncomplained of the crying evil that the king had given away to favourites\r\nall the revenues of his crown, so that his household was supported by\r\nacts of rapine and extortion on the part of his purveyors. Thirdly, the\r\nlaws were administered with great partiality, and justice was not to be\r\nobtained. Grievous taxes, moreover, were levied upon the commons, while\r\nthe destroyers of the land were living upon the patrimony of the crown.\r\nAnd now a heavier charge than ever was imposed upon the inhabitants; for\r\nthe king, borrowing an idea from the new system of military service in\r\nFrance, had commanded every township to furnish at its own cost a\r\ncertain number of men for the royal army; ‘which imposition and\r\ntalliage,’ wrote the lords in this manifesto, ‘if it be continued to\r\ntheir heirs and successors, will be the heaviest charge and worst\r\nexample that ever grew in England, and the foresaid subjects and the\r\nsaid heirs and successors in such bondage as their ancestors were never\r\ncharged with.’[188-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 188-1: It appears by Letter 377 that privy seals were\r\n    issued in 1459 addressed on the back to certain persons, requiring\r\n    them to be with the king at Leicester on the 10th of May, each\r\n    with a body of men sufficiently armed, and with provision for\r\n    their own expenses for two months. One of these privy seals,\r\n    signed by the king himself, was addressed specially to John\r\n    Paston’s eldest son, John, who at this time could not have been\r\n    more than nineteen years of age. On its arrival, his mother\r\n    consulted with neighbours whether it was indispensable to obey\r\n    such an injunction, and on their opinion that it was, wrote to her\r\n    husband for instructions.]\r\n\r\nBesides these evils, the infatuated policy into which the king had been\r\nled by his ill-advisers, threatened to lose Ireland and Calais to the\r\ncrown, as France had been lost already; for in the former country\r\nletters had been sent under the Privy Seal to the chieftains who had\r\nhitherto resisted the king’s authority, actually encouraging them to\r\nattempt the conquest of the land, while in regard to Calais the king had\r\nbeen induced to write letters to his enemies not to show that town any\r\nfavour, and thus had given them the greatest possible inducement to\r\nattempt its capture. Meanwhile the Earls of Shrewsbury and Wiltshire and\r\nViscount Beaumont, who directed everything, kept the king himself, in\r\nsome things, from the exercise of his own free will, and had caused him\r\nto assemble the Parliament of Coventry for the express purpose of\r\nruining the Duke of York and his friends, whose domains they had\r\neverywhere pillaged and taken to their own use.[189-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 189-1: The articles will be found in Holinshed, iii.\r\n    652-3; and in Davies’s _Chronicle_, 86-90.]\r\n\r\nIt was impossible, in the nature of things, that evils such as these\r\ncould be allowed to continue long, and the day of reckoning was now at\r\nhand. Of the great events that followed, it will be sufficient here to\r\nnote the sequence in the briefest possible words. [Sidenote: The battle\r\nof Northampton.] On the 10th July the king was taken prisoner at the\r\nbattle of Northampton, and was brought to London by the confederate\r\nlords. The government, of course, came thus entirely into their hands.\r\nYoung George Nevill, Bishop of Exeter, was made Chancellor of England,\r\nLord Bourchier was appointed Lord Treasurer, and a Parliament was\r\nsummoned to meet at Westminster for the purpose of reversing the\r\nattainders passed in the Parliament of Coventry. Of the elections for\r\nthis Parliament we have some interesting notices in Letter 415, from\r\nwhich we may see how the new turn in affairs had affected the politics\r\nof the county of Norfolk. From the first it was feared that after the\r\nthree earls had got the king into their hands, the old intriguers,\r\nTuddenham and Heydon, would be busy to secure favour, or at all events\r\nindulgence, from the party now in the ascendant. But letters-missive\r\nwere obtained from the three earls, directed to all mayors and other\r\nofficers in Norfolk, commanding in the king’s name that no one should do\r\nthem injury, and intimating that the earls did not mean to show them any\r\nfavour if any person proposed to sue them at law.[189-2] Heydon,\r\nhowever, did not choose to remain in Norfolk. He was presently heard of\r\nfrom Berkshire, for which county he had found interest to get himself\r\nreturned in the new Parliament.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 189-2: No. 410.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John Paston in Parliament.] John Paston also was returned to\r\nthis Parliament as one of the representatives of his own county of\r\nNorfolk. His sympathies were entirely with the new state of things. And\r\nhis friend and correspondent, Friar Brackley, who felt with him that the\r\nwellbeing of the whole land depended entirely on the Earl of Warwick,\r\nsent him exhortations out of Scripture to encourage him in the\r\nperformance of his political duties.[190-1] But what would be the effect\r\nof the coming over from Ireland of the Duke of York, who had by this\r\ntime landed at Chester, and would now take the chief direction of\r\naffairs?[190-2] Perhaps the chief fear was that he would be too\r\nindulgent to political antagonists. Moreover, the Dowager Duchess of\r\nSuffolk had contrived to marry her son to one of York’s daughters, and\r\nit was apprehended her influence would be considerable. ‘The Lady of\r\nSuffolk,’ wrote Friar Brackley to Paston, ‘hath sent up her son and his\r\nwife to my Lord of York to ask grace for a sheriff the next year,\r\nStapleton, Boleyn, or Tyrell, _qui absit!_ God send you Poynings, W.\r\nPaston, W. Rokewood, or Arblaster. Ye have much to do, Jesus speed you!\r\nYe have many good prayers, what of the convent, city, and\r\ncountry.’[190-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 190-1: Letter 415.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 190-2: Letter 419.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 190-3: Letter 415.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of hope, fear, and expectation which the new turn of\r\naffairs awakened in some, and particularly in the friends of John\r\nPaston. The next great move in the political game perhaps exceeded the\r\nanticipations even of Friar Brackley. [Sidenote: York challenges the\r\nCrown.] Yet though the step was undoubtedly a bold one, never, perhaps,\r\nwas a high course of action more strongly suggested by the results of\r\npast experience. After ten miserable years of fluctuating policy, the\r\nattainted Yorkists were now for the fourth time in possession of power;\r\nbut who could tell that they would not be a fourth time set aside and\r\nproclaimed as traitors? For yet a fourth time since the fall of Suffolk,\r\nEngland might be subjected to the odious rule of favourites under a\r\nwell-intentioned king, whose word was not to be relied on. To the\r\ncommonweal the prospect was serious enough; to the Duke of York and his\r\nfriends it was absolute and hopeless ruin. But York had now determined\r\nwhat to do. On the 10th of October, the third day of the Parliament, he\r\ncame to Westminster with a body of 500 armed men, and took up quarters\r\nfor himself within the royal palace. On the 16th he entered the House of\r\nLords, and having sat down in the king’s throne, he delivered to the\r\nLord Chancellor a writing in which he distinctly claimed that he, and\r\nnot Henry, was by inheritance rightful king of England.[191-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 191-1: W. Worc., 483; Fabyan; _Rolls of Parl._ v. 375.]\r\n\r\nThe reader is of course aware of the fact on which this claim was based,\r\nnamely, that York, through the female line, was descended from Lionel,\r\nDuke of Clarence, third son of Edward III., while King Henry, his\r\nfather, and his grandfather had all derived their rights from John of\r\nGaunt, who was Lionel’s younger brother. Henry IV. indeed was an\r\nundoubted usurper; but to set aside his family after they had been in\r\npossession of the throne for three generations must have seemed a very\r\nquestionable proceeding. Very few of the lords at first appeared to\r\nregard it with favour. The greater number stayed away from the\r\nHouse.[191-2] But the duke’s counsel insisting upon an answer, the House\r\nrepresented the matter to the king, desiring to know what he could\r\nallege in opposition to the claim of York. The king, however, left the\r\nlords to inquire into it themselves; and as it was one of the gravest\r\nquestions of law, the lords consulted the justices. But the justices\r\ndeclined the responsibility of advising in a matter of so high a nature.\r\nThey were the king’s justices, and could not be of counsel where the\r\nking himself was a party. The king’s serjeants and attorney were then\r\napplied to, but were equally unwilling to commit themselves; so that the\r\nlords themselves brought forward and discussed of their own accord a\r\nnumber of objections to the Duke of York’s claim. At length it was\r\ndeclared as the opinion of the whole body of the peers that his title\r\ncould not be defeated, but a compromise was suggested and mutually\r\nagreed to that the king should be allowed to retain his crown for life,\r\nthe succession reverting to the duke and his heirs immediately after\r\nHenry’s death.[191-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 191-2: W. Worc., 484.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 191-3: _Rolls of Parl._ v. 375-9.]\r\n\r\nSo the matter was settled by a great and solemn act of state. But even a\r\nparliamentary settlement, produced by a display of armed force, will\r\nscarcely command the respect that it ought to do if there is armed force\r\nto overthrow it. The king himself, it is true, appears to have been\r\ntreated with respect, and with no more abridgment of personal liberty\r\nthan was natural to the situation.[192-1] Nor could it be said that the\r\npeers were insensible of the responsibility they incurred in a grave\r\nconstitutional crisis. But respect for constitutional safeguards had\r\nbeen severely shaken, and no securities now could bridle the spirit of\r\nfaction: suspicion also of itself produced new dangers. The Duke of\r\nYork, after all the willingness he had shown in Parliament to accept a\r\ncompromise, seems to have been accused of violating the settlement as\r\nsoon as it was made; for on that very night on which it was arranged\r\n(31st October), we are told by a contemporary writer that ‘the king\r\nremoved unto London against his will to the bishop’s palace, and the\r\nDuke of York came unto him that same night by torchlight and took upon\r\nhim as king, and said in many places that “This is ours by\r\nright.”’[192-2] Perhaps the facts looked worse than they were really;\r\nfor it had been agreed in Parliament, though not formally expressed in\r\nthe Accord, that the duke should be once more Protector and have the\r\nactual government.[192-3] But it is not surprising that Margaret and her\r\nfriends would recognise nothing of what had been done in Parliament.\r\nSince the battle of Northampton she had been separated from her husband.\r\nShe fled with her son first into Cheshire, afterwards into Wales, to\r\nHarlech Castle, and then to Denbigh, which Jasper Tudor, Earl of\r\nPembroke, had just won for the House of Lancaster.[192-4] Her flight had\r\nbeen attended with difficulties, especially near Malpas, where she was\r\nrobbed by a servant of her own, who met her and put her in fear of the\r\nlives of herself and her child.[192-5] In Wales she was joined by the\r\nDuke of Exeter, who was with her in October.[192-6] From thence she\r\nsailed to Scotland, where the enemies of the Duke of York were specially\r\nwelcome. For James II., profiting, as might be expected, by the\r\ndissensions of England, a month after the battle of Northampton, had\r\nlaid siege to Roxburgh, where he was killed by the bursting of a cannon.\r\nMargaret, with her son, arrived at Dumfries in January 1461, and met his\r\nwidow, Mary of Gueldres, at Lincluden Abbey.[193-1] Meanwhile her\r\nadherents in the North of England held a council at York, and the Earl\r\nof Northumberland, with Lords Clifford, Dacres, and Nevill, ravaged the\r\nlands of the duke and of the Earl of Salisbury. The duke on this\r\ndissolved Parliament after obtaining from it powers to put down the\r\nrebellion,[193-2] and marched northwards with the Earl of Salisbury. A\r\nfew days before Christmas they reached the duke’s castle of Sandal,\r\nwhere they kept the festival, the enemy being not far off at\r\nPomfret.[193-3] On the 30th December was fought the disastrous battle of\r\nWakefield, [Sidenote: The battle of Wakefield.] when the Yorkists were\r\ndefeated, the duke and the Earl of Salisbury being slain in the field,\r\nand the duke’s son, the Earl of Rutland, ruthlessly murdered by Lord\r\nClifford after the battle.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 192-1: Though he was taken prisoner at the battle of\r\n    Northampton, and had ever since been in the power of the victors,\r\n    he does not appear to have been placed under any kind of\r\n    restraint. In October, before the Parliament met, he was spending\r\n    the time in hunting at Greenwich and Eltham.--No. 419.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 192-2: _Collections of a London Citizen_, 208 (Camden\r\n    Society).]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 192-3: _English Chronicle_ (Davies), 106; Fabyan; Hall,\r\n    249.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 192-4: _Privy Council Proceedings_, vi. 303.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 192-5: _Collections of a London Citizen_, 209.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 192-6: No. 419.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 193-1: _Auchinleck Chronicle_, 21. _Exchequer Rolls of\r\n    Scotland_, vii. 8, 39, 157.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 193-2: _Rolls of Parl._ v. 382.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 193-3: W. Worc., 484.]\r\n\r\nThe story of poor young Rutland’s butchery is graphically described by\r\nan historian of the succeeding age who, though perhaps with some\r\ninaccuracies of detail as to fact, is a witness to the strong impression\r\nleft by this beginning of barbarities. The account of it given by Hall,\r\nthe chronicler, is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  ‘While this battle was in fighting, a priest called Sir Robert\r\n  Aspall, chaplain and schoolmaster to the young Earl of Rutland,\r\n  second son to the above-named Duke of York, scarce of the age of\r\n  twelve years [he was really in his eighteenth year], a fair\r\n  gentleman and a maiden-like person, perceiving that flight was more\r\n  safeguard than tarrying, both for him and his master, secretly\r\n  conveyed the Earl out of the field by the Lord Clifford’s band\r\n  towards the town. But or he could enter into a house, he was by the\r\n  said Lord Clifford espied, followed, and taken, and, by reason of\r\n  his apparel, demanded what he was. The young gentleman, dismayed,\r\n  had not a word to speak, but kneeled on his knees, imploring mercy\r\n  and desiring grace, both with holding up his hands and making\r\n  dolorous countenance, for his speech was gone for fear. “Save him,”\r\n  said his chaplain, “for he is a prince’s son, and peradventure may\r\n  do you good hereafter.” With that word, the Lord Clifford marked him\r\n  and said--“By God’s blood, thy father slew mine; and so will I do\r\n  thee and all thy kin”; and with that word stack the Earl to the\r\n  heart with his dagger, and bade his chaplain bear the Earl’s mother\r\n  word what he had done and said.’\r\n\r\nAnother illustration which the chronicler goes on to give of Clifford’s\r\nbloodthirsty spirit may be true in fact, but is certainly wrong as\r\nregards time. For he represents Queen Margaret as ‘not far from the\r\nfield’ when the battle had been fought, and says that Clifford having\r\ncaused the duke’s head to be cut off and crowned in derision with a\r\npaper crown, presented the ghastly object to her upon a pole with the\r\nwords:--‘Madam, your war is done; here is your king’s ransom.’ Margaret,\r\nas we have seen, was really in Scotland at the time, where she\r\nnegotiated an alliance with the Scots, to whom she agreed to deliver up\r\nBerwick for aid to her husband’s cause. But soon afterwards she came to\r\nYork, where, at a council of war, she and her adherents determined to\r\nmarch on London. So it may have been a fact that Clifford presented to\r\nher the head of York upon a pole with the words recorded. But never was\r\nprophecy more unhappy; for instead of the war being ended, or the king\r\nbeing ransomed, there cannot be a doubt these deeds of wickedness\r\nimparted a new ferocity to the strife and hastened on the termination of\r\nHenry’s imbecile, unhappy reign. Within little more than two months\r\nafter the battle of Wakefield the son of the murdered Duke of York was\r\nproclaimed king in London, by the title of Edward IV., and at the end of\r\nthe third month the bloody victory of Towton almost destroyed, for a\r\nlong time, the hopes of the House of Lancaster. From that day Henry led\r\na wretched existence, now as an exile, now as a prisoner, for eleven\r\nunhappy years, saving only a few months’ interval, during which he was\r\nmade king again by the Earl of Warwick, without the reality of power,\r\nand finally fell a victim, as was generally believed, to political\r\nassassination. As for Margaret, she survived her husband, but she also\r\nsurvived her son, and the cause for which she had fought with so much\r\npertinacity was lost to her for ever.\r\n\r\nAnd now we must halt in our political survey. Henceforth, though public\r\naffairs must still require attention, we shall scarcely require to\r\nfollow them with quite so great minuteness. We here take leave, for the\r\nmost part, of matters, both public and private, contained in the Letters\r\nduring the reign of Henry VI. But one event which affected greatly the\r\ndomestic history of the Pastons in the succeeding reign, must be\r\nmentioned before we go further. It was not long after the commencement\r\nof those later troubles--more precisely, it was on the 5th November\r\n1459, six weeks after the battle of Bloreheath, and little more than\r\nthree after the dispersion of the Yorkists at Ludlow--that the aged Sir\r\nJohn Fastolf breathed his last, within the walls of that castle which it\r\nhad been his pride to rear and to occupy in the place of his birth.\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Sir John Fastolf.] By his will, of which, as will be\r\nseen, no less than three different instruments were drawn up, he\r\nbequeathed to John Paston and his chaplain, Sir Thomas Howes, all his\r\nlands in the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk, for the purpose of\r\nfounding that college or religious community at Caister, on the erection\r\nof which he had bestowed latterly so much thought. The manner in which\r\nthis bequest affected the fortunes of the Paston family has now to be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fastolf’s Lands_\r\n\r\nUnder the feudal system, as is well known, on the death of any tenant\r\n_in capite_ of the crown, his lands were seized in the king’s name by an\r\nofficer called the escheator, until it was ascertained by a jury of the\r\ncounty who was the next heir that should succeed to the property, and\r\nwhether the king had any right of wardship by reason of his being under\r\nage. [Sidenote: A.D. 1459.] But when Sir John Fastolf died, he left no\r\nheir, nor was he, strictly speaking, at his death a tenant _in capite_\r\nof the crown. [Sidenote: The lands of Sir John Fastolf.] He had at\r\ndifferent times handed over all his landed property to trustees, who\r\nwere to hold it to his use so long as he lived, and to apply it after\r\nhis death to the purposes mentioned in his will. For the greater part of\r\nhis lands in the counties of Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, and Surrey, he had\r\nappointed one body of trustees as early as the year 1449, ten years\r\nbefore his death.[196-1] This body consisted of five bishops, including\r\nthe two primates, three lords, two justices of the King’s Bench, two\r\nknights, and ten other persons. But of these original trustees a good\r\nnumber were already dead, when, in the year 1457, a new trust was\r\ncreated, and the greater part of the Norfolk and Suffolk property was\r\nvested in the names of Thomas Bourchier, Archbishop of Canterbury,\r\nWilliam Waynflete, Bishop of Winchester, William Yelverton, Justice of\r\nthe King’s Bench, John Paston, Esq., Henry Fylongley, Esq., Thomas\r\nHowes, clerk, and William Paston. In the preceding year he had already\r\ncreated these same persons, with the addition of William Jenney, his\r\ntrustees for the manor of Titchwell, in Norfolk, and the same again,\r\nwith Jenney, but without Bishop Waynflete, for the manor of Beighton.\r\nThe trust-deed for the former manor was dated 1st April 34 Henry VI.,\r\nand that for the latter 26th March 34 Henry VI.[196-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 196-1: The deed is dated 7 July 27 Hen. VI., and\r\n    inrolled on the _Close Roll_, 29 Hen. VI. m., 39, _in dorso_.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 196-2: _Inquisition post mortem_, 38 and 39 Henry VI.,\r\n    No. 48.]\r\n\r\nThus it appears that as early as the month of March 1456, about a year\r\nand a half after Sir John Fastolf had taken up his abode in Norfolk,\r\nJohn Paston and his brother William were already named by him as\r\ntrustees for some of his property. [Sidenote: John and William Paston,\r\ntrustees.] From that time the influence of John Paston with the old\r\nknight continued to increase till, as it was evident that the latter\r\ndrew near his end, it became a subject of jealousy and suspicion. Of\r\ncourse, these feelings were not diminished when it was found after\r\nFastolf’s death that, subject only to the obligation of founding his\r\ncollege at Caister, and paying 4000 marks to his other executors, he had\r\nin effect bequeathed to John Paston the whole of his lands in the\r\ncounties of Norfolk and Suffolk. Yet it does not appear that in\r\nFastolf’s latter days John Paston was about him more than usual. He was\r\njust as frequently away in London as he had been in any previous\r\nyear.[197-1] But even when absent, he had a very staunch and hearty\r\nfriend in Friar Brackley, who frequently visited the sick chamber, and\r\ntook every opportunity to preserve and augment the high esteem that\r\nFastolf entertained for him. At the last Brackley wrote to urge him to\r\ncome down to Norfolk, as the patient evidently could not live much\r\nlonger. ‘It is high time; he draweth fast homeward, and is right low\r\nbrought, and sore weakened and feebled.’ Paston must bring with him a\r\ndraft petition to the king about the foundation of the college at\r\nCaister, and an arrangement with the monks of St. Benet’s, for the dying\r\nman’s satisfaction. ‘Every day this five days he saith, “God send me\r\nsoon my good cousin Paston, for I hold him a faithful man, and ever one\r\nman.” _Cui ego_: “That is sooth,” &c. _Et ille_: “Show me not the meat,\r\nshow me the man.”’ Such is the curious report written by Dr. Brackley to\r\nPaston himself of the anxiety with which the old knight expected him\r\nshortly before his death.[197-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 197-1: _See_ Nos. 376, 377, 379, 380, 383.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 197-2: No. 383.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: William Worcester.] On the other hand, William Worcester, who\r\nhad so long acted as Fastolf’s private secretary, was perhaps a little\r\njealous at the closer intimacy and greater influence of Paston with his\r\nmaster. At least, if this was not his feeling before Sir John Fastolf’s\r\ndeath, he expressed it plainly shortly afterwards. It was, he\r\nconsidered, owing to himself that John Paston had stood so high in\r\nFastolf’s favour;[197-3] and it seemed scarcely reasonable that Paston\r\nshould have the principal share in the administration of the property\r\nwhile he, who had been so long in Fastolf’s service, so devoted to his\r\ninterests, and yet so ill rewarded during his master’s life, found no\r\nkind of provision made for him in the will. It was, indeed, perfectly\r\ntrue that Fastolf had named him one of his executors. But this\r\nexecutorship, as it turned out, was not a thing likely to yield him\r\neither profit or importance. For by the last will, made immediately\r\nbefore the testator’s death, a body of ten executors was constituted, of\r\nwhom two were to have the sole and absolute administration, the others\r\nhaving nothing whatever to do except when those two thought fit to ask\r\nfor their advice. The two acting executors were to be John Paston and\r\nThomas Howes. William Worcester was one of the other eight.[198-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 197-3: No. 401.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 198-1: No. 387.]\r\n\r\nYet, at first, he refrained from expressing dissatisfaction, and showed\r\nhimself ready to co-operate with John Paston. Within a week after\r\nFastolf’s death, he accompanied William Paston up to London, and joined\r\nhim in an interview with Bishop Waynflete, at that time Lord Chancellor,\r\nwho was one of the other executors. In accordance with Bishop\r\nWaynflete’s advice, he and William Paston proceeded to collect and\r\nsequester the goods of the deceased in different parts of London until\r\nthe time that John Paston could have an interview with the bishop. They\r\nmanaged to have goods out of the Abbey of Bermondsey that no one knew\r\nabout, except William Paston and Worcester themselves, and another man\r\nnamed Plomer. In short, William Worcester acted at this time as a most\r\nconfidential and trusty friend to John Paston’s interests, being either\r\nentirely ignorant how little provision was made for his own, or trusting\r\nto Paston’s benevolence and sense of justice for that reward which was\r\nnot expressly ‘nominated in the bond.’ And William Paston felt his\r\nclaims so strongly that he could not help insinuating to his brother\r\nthat he was bound in honour to make him a provision for life. ‘I\r\nunderstand by him,’ wrote William Paston, ‘he will never have other\r\nmaster but his old master; and to my conceit it were pity but if he\r\nshould stand in such case by my master he should never need service,\r\nconsidering how my master trusted him, and the long years that he hath\r\nbeen with him in and many shrewd journeys for his sake.’[198-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 198-2: Nos. 391, 393.]\r\n\r\nBut very shortly afterwards the manner in which Worcester spoke of\r\nPaston revealed a bitter sense of disappointment and injustice. He\r\nasserted that Fastolf had actually granted him a portion of land to live\r\nupon, and that Sir Thomas Howes, Fastolf’s confessor, who was his wife’s\r\nuncle, had been present in the chapel at Caister when this gift was\r\nconceded. Worcester’s wife had in fact asked Sir Thomas to choose the\r\nland. Nevertheless, when he came to demand of Paston that to which he\r\nconsidered he had a lawful claim, the latter was displeased with him;\r\nnor did the two come to a good understanding again during Paston’s\r\nlife.[199-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 199-1: No. 401. It appears by a document inrolled in the\r\n    _Close Roll_ of 39 Henry VI., m. 13, _in dorso_, that Worcester on\r\n    the 28th August 1460 executed a deed making over all his goods and\r\n    chattels (_bona mea et catalla mobilia et immobilia, viva et\r\n    mortua, ubicumque et in quorumcumque manibus_), and all debts due\r\n    to him from whatever persons, to Henry Everyngham, Esq., Hugh\r\n    Fenne, gentleman, Henry Wyndesore, gentleman, Robert Toppes, jun.,\r\n    gentleman, and John Bokkyng, gentleman; which deed he acknowledged\r\n    in Chancery on the 1st September following (_see_ Appendix to this\r\n    Introduction). Apparently the object of this was to give others an\r\n    interest in vindicating what he supposed to be his rights.]\r\n\r\nIt was but nine days after Sir John Fastolf’s death, and three days\r\nafter his first interview with the chancellor, Bishop Waynflete, that\r\nWilliam Paston, in writing to his brother, expressed his intention of\r\ngoing to the bishop again for writs of _diem clausit extremum_. These\r\nwrits were the ordinary authority under which the escheators of the\r\ndifferent counties wherein the deceased had held lands would proceed to\r\ninquire what the manors were, and to whom they ought to descend.\r\n[Sidenote: Claimants of Fastolf’s property.] That many pretenders would\r\nlay claim to the different portions of those rich domains, John Paston\r\nand his brother knew full well. The Duke of Exeter had already set up a\r\nclaim to Fastolf’s place in Southwark, on what grounds it is impossible\r\nto say. Others, who had no hope of proving title to any part of the\r\nproperty themselves, expected to win favour at court by offering to\r\nestablish the rights of the crown in all the goods and chattels. William\r\nPaston accordingly endeavoured to secure the friendship of the Lord\r\nTreasurer, James, Earl of Wiltshire and Ormond; but though the earl gave\r\nhim fair words, William Paston was advised to put no trust in\r\nhim.[199-2] In point of fact, soon after Christmas, the earl entered Sir\r\nJohn’s mansion in Southwark, and occupied it for a time as if it had\r\nbeen his own dwelling-house.[199-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 199-2: No. 391.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 199-3: W. Worcester’s _Annals_.]\r\n\r\nThe escheator of the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk was Richard\r\nSouthwell, a friend of John Paston’s, and if the writs of _diem clausit\r\nextremum_ had been issued at once, the latter doubtless hoped that the\r\nrights of Fastolf’s trustees would have been immediately acknowledged by\r\ntwo different juries, the one in Norfolk and the other in Suffolk. But\r\nthe efforts of William Paston were not crowned with such speedy success\r\nas he and his brother could have wished. Already, on the 10th November,\r\nwrits of _diem clausit extremum_ had issued without his applying for\r\nthem, but they were only for the counties of Surrey and Essex, in which\r\nJohn Paston was not interested. Special commissions to the same effect\r\nfor the counties of Wilts and Yorkshire were procured from the king at\r\nCoventry eighteen days later. [Sidenote: A.D. 1460.] But for Norfolk and\r\nSuffolk the writs were not issued till the 13th May in the following\r\nyear.[200-1] The delay was most probably owing to representations on the\r\npart of Paston’s enemies; and to the same cause we may attribute the\r\nfact that even after the writ was issued it was not acted on for five\r\nmonths longer, so that nearly a whole year had elapsed since Sir John\r\nFastolf’s death before the Norfolk and Suffolk inquisitions were held.\r\nBut at length the opposition was overcome. ‘A great day’ was holden at\r\nAcle before the under-sheriff and the under-escheator, in presence of\r\nsome of the most substantial gentlemen of Norfolk; ‘and the matter,’\r\nwrote Margaret Paston to her husband, ‘is well sped after your\r\nintent.’[200-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 200-1: _Inquis. post mortem_, 38 and 39 Henry VI., No.\r\n    48.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 200-2: No. 423.]\r\n\r\nAlready John Paston’s increased importance in his native county had come\r\nto be acknowledged. He was at this time knight of the shire for Norfolk.\r\nHis wife was living at Hellesdon, on the Fastolf estates, two miles out\r\nof Norwich; and the mayor and mayoress paid her the compliment of\r\nsending thither their dinners and inviting themselves out to dine with\r\nher. The mills at Hellesdon and the lands at Caister were let by his\r\nagents, and apparently, in spite of his opponents, whoever they may have\r\nbeen, he had succeeded in obtaining quiet possession of all Fastolf’s\r\nlands in Norfolk.[200-3] Equally little resistance seems to have been\r\nmade to his claims in the county of Suffolk, where an inquisition was\r\ntaken at Bungay nine days after that which had been taken at Acle. In\r\neach county the jury limited themselves to declaring the names of the\r\ntrustees in whose hands the property remained at Fastolf’s death, and\r\nnothing was said about the will. A will, in itself, could convey no\r\ntitle to lands, and the juries had nothing to do with it. But in both\r\ncounties John Paston, either as executor or as one of the trustees, was\r\nallowed to assume at this time the entire control of the property.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 200-3: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\nBut now came the renewal of civil war--the battle of Wakefield, soon\r\navenged by the proclamation of Edward IV. as king, and the bloody\r\nvictory of Towton. [Sidenote: A.D. 1461.] The kingdom was convulsed from\r\nend to end, and there was little chance for doubtful titles and disputed\r\nclaims, except when supported by the strong arm of power. Long before\r\nthe time at which we have now arrived, [Sidenote: The Duke of Norfolk.]\r\nthe Duke of Norfolk had set covetous eyes upon Sir John Fastolf’s\r\nmagnificent new castle of Caister, and he had spread a report in the\r\ncountry that the owner had given it to him.[201-1] But it would seem\r\nthat Sir John himself had never entertained such an idea, and if ever in\r\nconversation with the duke he had let fall something that might have\r\nencouraged the hope, he had taken special care before his death to show\r\nthat it was unfounded. For the duke had visited Sir John in September\r\nbefore he died, and had proposed to purchase of him the reversion of the\r\nmanor; but Sir John distinctly told him he had given it to Paston for\r\nthe purpose of founding a college.[201-2] Indeed, it is perfectly clear\r\nthat for years he had intended it to be turned into an abode of priests,\r\nand not made a residence for any such powerful nobleman. And this\r\nintention, which is apparent enough in several of the letters written\r\nduring his lifetime, was expressed in the most unambiguous language in\r\nthe document which John Paston declared to have been his last\r\nwill.[201-3] Indeed, if we believe John Paston’s testimony, interested\r\nthough it no doubt may be, it was chiefly from a fear that his executors\r\nmight sell the place, not, indeed, to the duke, of whom he seems at that\r\ntime to have ceased to entertain any apprehension, but to the Viscount\r\nBeaumont, the Duke of Somerset, or the Earl of Warwick, that the old\r\nknight determined to make Paston his principal executor.[201-4] So, ‘to\r\navoid that no lord, nor great estate, should inhabit in time coming\r\nwithin the great mansion,’ he made a covenant with Paston by which the\r\nlatter was to have in fee-simple all his lands in the counties of\r\nNorfolk and Suffolk, subject only to the payment of a sum of 4000 marks\r\nand the duty of establishing in Caister Castle ‘a college of seven\r\nreligious men, monks, or secular priests, and seven poor folk, to pray\r\nfor his soul and the souls of his wife, his father, and mother, and\r\nother that he was behold to, in perpetuity.’ And if in endeavouring to\r\ncarry out this object John Paston was interfered with by any one\r\nattempting to obtain possession of the place by force, he was enjoined\r\nto ‘pull down the said mansion, and every stone and stick thereof, and\r\ndo found three of the said seven priests or monks at St. Benet’s, and\r\none at Yarmouth, one at Attleborough, and one at St. Olave’s Church at\r\nSouthwark.’[202-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 201-1: No. 222 (in vol. ii.).]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 201-2: No. 543.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 201-3: No. 385.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 201-4: No. 390.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 202-1: No. 386.]\r\n\r\nYet, notwithstanding all this, the Duke of Norfolk, within three months\r\nafter the accession of Edward IV., and little more than a year and a\r\nhalf after Sir John Fastolf’s death,[202-2] had certainly taken\r\npossession of the great mansion of Caister. The confusion of the time\r\nundoubtedly favoured the act, and redress might well have been a\r\ntroublesome matter, as the Duke of Norfolk was a nobleman whom perhaps\r\neven the king would not care to displease. But Edward was a king who,\r\nwith many faults, was most honourably anxious from the first to do\r\njustice even to the meanest of his subjects.[202-3] Paston repaired to\r\nthe royal presence, and obtained letters from the king to the duke,\r\nwhich his servant, Richard Calle, conveyed to Framlingham. They were\r\ndelivered to his lordship at the lodge of his demesne, but the messenger\r\nwas not admitted to his presence. The duke, however, wrote an answer to\r\nthe king, promising shortly to repair to Court, when he offered to prove\r\nthat some of the statements in Paston’s letters were erroneous, and that\r\nhe himself was the person who had the best claim to the manor. It\r\nappears there was one other claimant besides, viz. Thomas Fastolf of\r\nCowhaw; but he, not expecting to make his title good against Paston\r\nhimself, and having need of a powerful friend in some other matters,\r\ngave up his claim to the duke, and brought documents to justify the\r\nlatter in taking possession by the right derived from him.[203-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 202-2: He had probably done so before by authority of\r\n    Henry VI., for in the beginning of 1460 Friar Brackley writes: ‘A\r\n    man of my Lord Norfolk told me here he came from London, and there\r\n    he had commonly voiced that the Duke of Norfolk should, by the\r\n    king’s commandment, keep his Easter at Caister for safeguard of\r\n    the country against Warwick and other such of the king’s\r\n    enemies.’--Vol. iii. p. 212.]\r\n\r\n  [[iii. 212 = second-to-last paragraph of letter 403]]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 202-3: Edward’s reply to another suit preferred by John\r\n    Paston this same year is an excellent example of this spirit of\r\n    impartiality. John Paston’s eldest son writes to his father as\r\n    follows, touching an interview he had had with the Lord Treasurer,\r\n    the Earl of Essex: ‘And now of late I, remembering him of the same\r\n    matter, inquired if he had moved the king’s highness therein. And\r\n    he answered me that he had felt and moved the king therein,\r\n    rehearsing the king’s answer therein: how that when he had moved\r\n    the king in the said manor of Dedham, beseeching him to be your\r\n    good lord therein, considering the service and true part that ye\r\n    have done and ought to him, and in especial the right that ye have\r\n    thereto, he said he would be your good lord therein, as he would\r\n    to the poorest man in England. He would hold with you in your\r\n    right; and as for favour, he will not be understood that he shall\r\n    show favour more to one man than to another, not to one in\r\n    England.’]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 203-1: Nos. 458, 465.]\r\n\r\nIn the end, however, Paston’s appeal to the king must have been\r\nsuccessful. Caister was certainly restored to him, and in all\r\nprobability it was restored within a month or two before the Duke of\r\nNorfolk’s death, which occurred that same year, in the beginning of\r\nNovember.[203-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 203-2: This perhaps may be a reason for supposing Letter\r\n    630 to have been written in the year 1461, notwithstanding the\r\n    difficulty mentioned in the preliminary note.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Beginning of Edward IV.’s Reign_\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding the even-handed justice of the king, the times were\r\nwild and unsettled. The revolution by which Henry was deposed was not a\r\nthing calculated to bring sudden peace and quiet. [Sidenote: Troubled\r\ntimes.] On the Patent Rolls of this year we have innumerable evidences\r\nof the state of alarm, confusion, and tumult which prevailed\r\ncontinuously for at least a twelvemonth over the whole\r\nkingdom. Commissions of array,[203-3] commissions to put down\r\ninsurrections,[203-4] and to punish outrages,[203-5] to arrest\r\nseditious persons,[203-6] to resist the king’s enemies at sea,[203-7]\r\nor to prepare beacons on the coast to give warning of apprehended\r\ninvasion,[204-1] are continually met with. Our Letters also tell the\r\nsame tale. Margaret Paston writes at one time about ‘Will. Lynys that\r\nwas with Master Fastolf, and such other as he is with him,’ who went\r\nabout the country accusing men of being Scots, and only letting them go\r\non payment of considerable bribes. ‘He took last week the parson of\r\nFreton, and but for my cousin Jerningham the younger, there would have\r\nled him forth with him; and he told them plainly, if they made any such\r\ndoings there, unless they had the letter to show for them, they should\r\nhave laid on[204-2] on their bodies.’[204-3] A still more flagrant\r\ninstance of lawlessness had occurred just before, of which our old\r\nacquaintance Thomas Denys was the victim. [Sidenote: Thomas Denys.] He\r\nwas at this time coroner of Norfolk. If not in Edward IV.’s service\r\nbefore he was king, he became a member of the royal household\r\nimmediately afterwards, and accompanied the new king to York before his\r\ncoronation. It appears that he had some complaints to make to the king\r\nof one Twyer, in Norfolk, and also of Sir John Howard, the sheriff of\r\nthe county, a relation of the Duke of Norfolk, of whom we have already\r\nspoken,[204-4] and shall have more to say presently. But scarcely had he\r\nreturned home when he was pulled out of his house by the parson of\r\nSnoring, a friend of Twyer’s, who accused him of having procured\r\nindictments against Twyer and himself, and carried him off, we are not\r\ntold whither.[204-5] All we know is that in the beginning of July Thomas\r\nDenys was murdered, and that there were various reports as to who had\r\ninstigated the crime. William Lomner believed that some men of the Duke\r\nof Norfolk’s council were implicated. Sir Miles Stapleton factiously\r\nendeavoured to lay the blame on John Berney of Witchingham. The parson\r\nof Snoring was put in the stocks, with four of his associates, but what\r\nfurther punishment they underwent does not appear. John Paston was\r\nentreated to use his influence to get them tried by a special\r\ncommission.[204-6] The most precise account of the crime is found in the\r\nrecords of the King’s Bench, which give us the date and place where it\r\noccurred. One Robert Grey of Warham, labourer, was indicted for having,\r\nalong with others, attacked Denys on Thursday the 2nd July, and dragged\r\nhim from his house at Gately to Egmere, not far from Walsingham, where\r\nthey killed him on the Saturday following.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 203-3: _Patent Roll_, 1 Edward IV. p. 1, m. 18 _d._,\r\n    dated March 16; and m. 19 _d._, dated May 10; p. 4, m. 22 _d._,\r\n    February 24 and March 1 (1462); also p. 2, m. 12 _d._ (against the\r\n    Scots), Nov. 13.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 203-4: _Ib._ p. 1, m. 27 _d._, March 28, and p. 3, m. 3\r\n    _d._, July 8.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 203-5: _Ib._ p. 2, m. 10 _d._, Aug. 17.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 203-6: _Ib._ p. 2, m. 12 _d._, Nov. 4; and p. 4, m. 22\r\n    _d._, Feb. 28 (1462).]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 203-7: _Ib._ p. 3, m. 3 _d._, July 12.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 204-1: _Ib._ p. 3, m. 3 _d._ and 27 _d._, Aug. 6 and 12;\r\n    also m. 8 _d._, Jan. 29.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 204-2: Such, I think, must be the meaning intended.

She has by this time become a widow, having\r\nlost her husband at the second battle of St. Albans, and her lands are\r\noccupied by the Countess of Northumberland and Robert Fenys, in\r\ndisregard of her rights.[205-1] In times of revolution and tumult the\r\nweak must go to the wall.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 205-1: No. 461.]\r\n\r\nBesides these illustrations of the social condition of the times, our\r\nLetters still abound with information not to be found elsewhere as to\r\nthe chief political events. [Sidenote: Political events.] Here we have\r\nthe record of the battle of Towton, of those who fell, and of those who\r\nwere wounded;[205-2] after which we find Henry VI. shut up in Yorkshire,\r\nin a place the name of which is doubtful.[205-3] Then we hear of the\r\nbeheading of the Earl of Wiltshire, and of his head being placed on\r\nLondon Bridge.[205-4] Then come matters relating to the coronation of\r\nEdward IV., which was delayed on account of the siege of\r\nCarlisle.[205-5] On this occasion, it seems, John Paston was to have\r\nreceived the honour of knighthood,[205-6] which he doubtless declined,\r\nhaving already compounded with Henry VI. not to be made a knight.[205-7]\r\nTwo years later, however, his eldest son was made one, very probably as\r\na substitute for himself, apparently just at the time when he attained\r\nthe age of twenty-one.[205-8] To the father such an honour would\r\nevidently have been a burden rather than a satisfaction.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 205-2: No. 450.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 205-3: No. 451.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 205-4: Nos. 451, 452.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 205-5: No. 457.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 205-6: Nos. 457, 460.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 205-7: No. 373.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 205-8: Sir John Paston must have been born in 1442. At\r\n    the inquisition taken in October 1466, after his father’s death,\r\n    he was found to be twenty-four years old and more.]\r\n\r\nBut on the whole John Paston stood well with his countrymen, and the\r\nchange of kings was an event from which he had no reason to anticipate\r\nbad consequences to himself. Since the death of Sir John Fastolf he had\r\nbecome a man of much greater importance, and he had been returned to\r\nParliament in the last year of Henry VI. as a supporter of the Duke of\r\nYork. He was now, in the first year of Edward IV., returned to\r\nParliament again. [Sidenote: John Paston returned to Parliament.] He was\r\napparently in good favour with the king, and had been since the\r\naccession of Edward for a short time resident in his household.[206-1]\r\nThe king also obtained from him the redelivery of the jewels pawned by\r\nhis father, the Duke of York, to Sir John Fastolf,[206-2] in\r\nconsideration of which he granted John Paston an assignment of 700\r\nmarks[206-3] on the fee-farm of the city of Norwich, and on the issues\r\nof the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. But his election as knight of\r\nthe shire for Norfolk did not pass altogether without question. Paston’s\r\nwife’s cousin, John Berney of Witchingham, whom Sir Miles Stapleton\r\naccused of being implicated in the murder of Denys, had taken a leading\r\npart in the proceedings, and Stapleton alleged that he was meditating\r\nfurther outrages. The people had appeared ‘jacked and saletted’ at the\r\nshire house, the under-sheriff was put in suspicion of Berney, and the\r\nsheriff, Sir John Howard, conceived it would be necessary to have a new\r\nelection. To this neither Berney nor Paston very much objected. Berney\r\nwas willing to give every assurance that he would do the under-sheriff\r\nno bodily hurt, but he considered his conduct that at the election had\r\nnot been creditable, and he desired that he would either intimate to the\r\npeople that the election should stand, or procure a new writ, and\r\npublicly announce the day on which another election should be holden. As\r\nfor Paston, he was perfectly satisfied, provided that he were not put to\r\nfurther expense, as he believed it was the general desire of the people\r\nto ratify what they had done; he only wished that it might be on a\r\nholiday, so as not to interfere with the people’s work. The matter was\r\ndiscussed before the king himself, John Paston and the under-sheriff\r\nbeing present, each to answer for his part in the affair, and a writ was\r\nfinally granted for a new election on St. Laurence’s Day. But from what\r\nhe had seen of the conduct of the under-sheriff, Paston seems to have\r\nbeen afraid the day might yet be changed, to his prejudice; so, in a\r\npersonal interview with that functionary, he got him to place the writ\r\nin his hands, and sent it down to his wife to keep until the new day of\r\nelection came round, charging her to see that the under-sheriff had it\r\nagain that day.[207-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 206-1: No. 459.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 206-2: No. 473. Compare No. 223. It is striking that,\r\n    notwithstanding his large possessions in land, the Duke of York\r\n    should have been unable for eight years to redeem these jewels.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 206-3: This was less than the sum (£487) for which the\r\n    jewels were pledged, and yet it was the whole compensation granted\r\n    both for the jewels and for a bond of 100 marks given by the Duke\r\n    of York to Fastolf, which Paston also surrendered.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 207-1: Nos. 466-8, 471, 475.]\r\n\r\n  [[but he considered his conduct that at the election\r\n  _text unchanged: 1st edition has same word order_]]\r\n\r\nHis suspicions of unfair dealing were probably too well founded. At all\r\nevents, the new election did not pass over peacefully any more than the\r\nprevious one, perhaps not so much so. We do not, indeed, hear any more\r\nof John Berney and Sir Miles Stapleton; [Sidenote: John Paston and Sir\r\nJohn Howard.] but the sheriff, Sir John Howard, had a violent\r\naltercation with Paston himself in the shire house, and one of Howard’s\r\nmen struck Paston twice with a dagger, so that he would have been\r\nseverely wounded but for the protection of a good doublet that he wore\r\non the occasion.[207-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 207-2: Nos. 477, 478.]\r\n\r\nThe occurrence was an awkward one. The feuds in the county of Norfolk\r\nhad already occupied the king’s attention once, and that which it was\r\nsupposed would have been a settlement had proved no settlement at all.\r\nPerhaps Edward had been too lenient towards old offenders; for Sir Miles\r\nStapleton was but an ally of Sir Thomas Tuddenham and John Heydon, of\r\nwhom we have heard so much in the days of Henry VI., and these two\r\npersonages were almost as influential as ever. Some time before the\r\nking’s coronation, they had received a royal pardon, on the strength of\r\nwhich, as we learn by a letter at that time, they intended going up to\r\nLondon with the Duchess of Suffolk to be present at the ceremony.[207-3]\r\nAnd very soon afterwards we have a renewal of the old complaints that\r\n‘the world was right wild, and had been sithence Heydon’s safeguard was\r\nproclaimed at Walsingham.’[207-4] But whoever was in fault, it was a\r\nserious thing for John Paston--who by this time hoped that he was in\r\nfavour with the king, and had actually got his eldest son introduced\r\ninto the king’s household[208-1]--that royal influence itself could not\r\nstill the angry feelings that had arisen about his election. The dispute\r\nmust now once more come before the king, and his adversary, in\r\nconsequence of his relation to the Duke of Norfolk, was doubtless a man\r\nof considerable influence. Paston himself, it is true, was in the\r\nposition of the injured party, but he forbore to complain. The subject,\r\nhowever, was brought by others under the notice of the king, who\r\ncommanded both Paston and Howard to appear before him, and was even\r\nincensed at the former for delaying to obey his summons. On the 11th of\r\nOctober the king said to one of John Paston’s friends: ‘We have sent two\r\nprivy seals to Paston by two yeomen of our chamber, and he disobeyeth\r\nthem; but we will send him another to-morrow, and, by God’s mercy, if he\r\ncome not then, he shall die for it. We will make all other men beware by\r\nhim how they shall disobey our writing. A servant of ours hath made a\r\ncomplaint of him. I cannot think that he hath informed us all truly. Yet\r\nnot for that we will not suffer him to disobey our writing; but sithence\r\nhe disobeyeth our writing, we may believe the better his guiding is as\r\nwe be informed.’[208-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 207-3: No. 458.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 207-4: No. 465.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 208-1: Nos. 477, 478.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 208-2: No. 484.]\r\n\r\n  [[Footnote 208-1: Nos. 477, 478.\r\n  _text reads “No.”_]]\r\n\r\nThese terrible words were reported to John Paston by his brother\r\nClement, then in London, who urged him to come up from Norfolk in all\r\npossible haste, and to be sure that he had some very weighty excuse for\r\nhaving neglected the previous messages. But besides great despatch in\r\ncoming, and a very weighty excuse, one thing more was very necessary to\r\nbe attended to, and this further admonition was added: ‘Also, if ye do\r\nwell, come right strong; for Howard’s wife made her boast that if any of\r\nher husband’s men might come to you, there should go no penny for your\r\nlife, and Howard hath with the king a great fellowship.’[208-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 208-3: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\nIt was clear this advice was not to be neglected. Paston seems to have\r\nbeen detained in Norfolk by a dispute he had with his co-executors Judge\r\nYelverton[209-1] and William Jenney, who refused to acknowledge his\r\nclaims as chief administrator of Fastolf’s will, and had entered on the\r\npossession of some of Sir John’s manors in Suffolk, near the borders of\r\nNorfolk.[209-2] But his absence from London had done great mischief. Not\r\nonly Howard, but the Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk were endeavouring to\r\nput him out of the king’s favour; and it was said that Caister would be\r\ngiven to the king’s brother, Richard, Duke of Gloucester.[209-3] Worst\r\nof all, however, was the fact that the king, who had evidently had a\r\ngood opinion of Paston hitherto, was beginning to alter his tone so\r\nseriously. [Sidenote: John Paston imprisoned.] No time, therefore, was\r\nto be lost in going up to London, and no marvel though, when he got\r\nthere, he was immediately committed to the Fleet.[209-4]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 209-1: I have already indicated my belief that Judge\r\n    Yelverton was the real person nicknamed Colinus Gallicus in Friar\r\n    Brackley’s letters. It is quite clear by No. 404 (one of the\r\n    letters found after the text of Mr. Arber’s edition had passed\r\n    through the press) that Colinus Gallicus not only could not have\r\n    been Worcester, but that he was a man of some social standing on\r\n    familiar terms with the Earl of Wiltshire. This, and the fact that\r\n    he was one of Fastolf’s executors, seem to prove his identity. It\r\n    is a satisfaction to find that, though Brackley did not love\r\n    William Worcester, the bitter words in No. 383 were not levelled\r\n    at him. Thus he wrote while Sir John Fastolf was on his deathbed:\r\n    ‘Colinus Gallicus says in Yarmouth and other places that he is an\r\n    executor. He said also yesterday before several persons, if once\r\n    he were in London, he wishes never to see Norfolk. He says also,\r\n    whereas the executors think they will have keys, after the death\r\n    others will have keys as well as they. He is a very deceitful man\r\n    (_falsissimus_). . . . That same Gallicus intensely hates the\r\n    rector (Howes), and would like to supplant him.’]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 209-2: No. 481.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 209-3: Nos. 482, 484.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 209-4: No. 488.]\r\n\r\nJohn Paston’s enemies, acting in several ways, had now done their worst.\r\nWhile the news of his dispute with Howard was reported to the king in\r\nthe most unfavourable terms, Judge Yelverton (he had been made Sir\r\nWilliam Yelverton at the coronation)[209-5] and William Jenney entered\r\nSir John Fastolf’s manor of Cotton in Suffolk, [Sidenote: Manor of\r\nCotton.] and distrained upon the tenants for rent. John Paston’s\r\nfaithful servant, Richard Calle, at first interrupted their proceedings,\r\nand when Jenney went to hold a court at Cotton, entered the place before\r\nhe came, along with Paston’s eldest son. By Calle’s activity and\r\nwatchfulness the court was holden in Paston’s name, although it had been\r\nsummoned in Jenney’s; and young John Paston next day, to requite the\r\nenemy for the trouble they had occasioned, took with him thirty men, and\r\nrode to Jenney’s place, where he carried off thirty-six head of neat,\r\nand brought them into Norfolk. This was a bold exploit, for the enemy\r\nhad threatened to drag him and Calle out of the place by violence; but\r\nCalle still remained, and twelve men with him, and kept possession for\r\nfive whole days, during which time he visited the farmers and tenants of\r\nthe manor, and ascertained that they were all well disposed towards\r\nPaston, and would pay no money to any one else. But, unfortunately, just\r\nat this point came the summons to Paston which he did not dare to\r\ndisobey; and his opponents knew how to profit by his absence and\r\nimprisonment in London. Yelverton and Jenney did not re-enter the manor\r\nthemselves; but Jenney sold his interest in it to one Gilbert Debenham,\r\nwho intended to give it to his son, Sir Gilbert, for a dwelling-house.\r\nAccordingly, by the encouragement of Jenney and Debenham, a body of\r\nunknown men took possession of the place, and garrisoned it against all\r\ncomers as strongly as they could. They broke down the drawbridge over\r\nthe moat, so that no one could enter the place except by means of a\r\nladder. They melted lead, and damaged the property in various ways,\r\nwhile John Paston was a prisoner in the Fleet. At the same time\r\nYelverton and Jenney took proceedings against Richard Calle. They\r\nsucceeded in getting him imprisoned upon an indictment for felony in\r\nNorfolk; and, fearing lest he should be acquitted upon that charge, they\r\n‘certified insurrections’ against him in the King’s Bench, and sent the\r\nsheriff a writ to bring him up to London in the beginning of\r\nNovember.[210-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 209-5: No. 457.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 210-1: Nos. 485-487.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John Paston released from prison.] But before the day that\r\nRichard Calle was to appear in the King’s Bench John Paston was\r\ndelivered from the Fleet, and his adversary Howard was sent to prison in\r\nhis place. The whole circumstances of the controversy had been laid\r\nbefore the king, and Paston was released after about a fortnight’s\r\nimprisonment. The news that he had got into trouble had excited much\r\nsympathy in Norwich, for he was highly popular, and Howard’s attempt to\r\nset aside his election met with very little approbation. Margaret\r\nPaston, especially, was sad and downcast at home, and though her husband\r\nhad sent her comfortable messages and letters showing that his case was\r\nnot so bad as it appeared to be, ‘yet I could not be merry,’ she wrote\r\nto him, ‘till this day that the Mayor sent to me, and sent me word that\r\nhe had knowledge for very truth that ye were delivered out of the\r\nFleet.’[211-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 211-1: No. 488.]\r\n\r\nThe king was much interested in the dispute, and was laudably determined\r\nto insist upon justice and fair dealing. He appointed Sir Thomas\r\nMontgomery, one of the knights of his own household, in whom he had\r\nspecial confidence, sheriff of Norfolk for the ensuing year. And when\r\nSir Thomas went down into Norfolk, he sent Sir William Yelverton along\r\nwith him, who, though not very favourably disposed towards Paston, was\r\nstill one of the justices, and bound to be impartial. Edward gave them\r\nboth a very explicit message from his own mouth to declare to the people\r\nin the shire house, and Yelverton was made the spokesman. [Sidenote:\r\nMessage from the king to the people of Norfolk.] He said the king had\r\nbeen greatly displeased to hear that there had been ‘a riotous\r\nfellowship’ in the county, but that he understood it was not owing to\r\ndisaffection on the part of the people generally--that it had been\r\nstirred up only by two or three evil-disposed persons--that he and the\r\nsheriff were there by the king’s command, ready to receive complaints\r\nfrom any man against any one whomsoever--and that if they could not\r\nprevail upon the wrongdoer to make restitution, the bills should be sent\r\nto the king; moreover, that if any man was afraid to set forth his\r\ngrievances, he should have full protection. At this point Yelverton\r\nasked the sheriff if he remembered anything more in the king’s message,\r\nand requested him in that case to declare it himself. The sheriff said\r\nSir William had set forth everything, except that the king had made\r\nspecial reference to two persons, Sir Thomas Tuddenham and Heydon. ‘Ah,\r\nthat is truth,’ said Yelverton; and he explained that any one who wished\r\nto complain of them should be protected also. The sheriff then added a\r\nfew words for his part, in which he promised faithfully before all the\r\npeople, ‘and swore by great oaths,’ that neither by fear nor by favour\r\nwould he be restrained from communicating to the king the truth as he\r\nfound it to be.[212-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 212-1: Nos. 497, 500.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1462.] All this was reassuring; but yet it was remarked\r\nthat John Paston did not come home again into Norfolk, and neither did\r\nhis colleague in the representation of the county, John Berney of\r\nWitchingham. This alone caused Margaret Paston still to entertain\r\napprehensions for her husband’s safety, and her suspicions were shared\r\nby many, who feared that they and Paston alike were involved in some new\r\ncharges of sedition. Busybodies, it was thought, had been insinuating to\r\nthe king that a very rebellious spirit prevailed in Norfolk, and report\r\nsaid that the Dukes of Clarence and Suffolk would come down with certain\r\njudges commissioned to try such persons as were ‘noised riotous.’ The\r\nrumour scarcely tended to pacify discontent. If it were true, people\r\nsaid they might as well go up to the king in a body to complain of those\r\nwho had done them wrong, and not wait quietly to be hanged at their own\r\ndoors. The Duke of Suffolk and his mother were the maintainers of those\r\nwho oppressed the country most, and nothing but severity could be\r\nexpected from a commission of which the duke was a member, unless his\r\ninfluence were counteracted by that of more popular persons.[212-2]\r\nThese misgivings, however, were happily soon after set at rest. The\r\nelection of John Paston was confirmed, and no such dreaded commission\r\nappears to have been sent into Norfolk. ‘The people of that country,’\r\nwrote Margaret Paston to her husband, ‘be right glad that the day went\r\nwith you on Monday as it did. You were never so welcome into Norfolk as\r\nye shall be when ye come home, I trow.’[212-3] Paston, in fact, appears\r\nto have gained a complete triumph over his adversaries, and it was said\r\nthat Howard was likely to lose his head.[212-4]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 212-2: No. 504.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 212-3: No. 505.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 212-4: No. 510.]\r\n\r\nBut the dispute with Yelverton and Jenney was still unsettled. Writs\r\nwere sent down into Norfolk to attach John Paston’s eldest son and\r\nRichard Calle upon indictments of trespass, and Debenham threatened to\r\nhold a court at Calcot in defiance of Paston’s agents.[212-5] It is\r\nevident, too, that he made good his word, and John Paston in consequence\r\ngot his tenants to bring actions against him.[213-1] Cross pleas between\r\nthe parties occupied the courts at Westminster for a year or more,\r\nduring which time we find it suggested to John Paston that he would\r\nnever get leave to live in peace, unless he could by some means obtain\r\n‘the good lordship’ of the Duke of Suffolk.[213-2] Appeals to law and\r\njustice were all very well, and no one fought his battle in the courts\r\nwith more unflinching energy than Paston; but unless he wished to be\r\nalways fighting, the best way for him was to obtain the favour of the\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 212-5: No. 538.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 213-1: No. 540.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 213-2: No. 544.]\r\n\r\nIt is a question, indeed, whether in this eternal turmoil of litigation\r\nat Westminster, and watch to keep out intruders in his Suffolk manors,\r\nJohn Paston had not to some extent neglected his duty to his children at\r\nhome. Such, at least, was the world’s opinion, and there were candid\r\nfriends who did not hesitate to tell him so. [Sidenote: Sir John\r\nPaston.] His eldest son now attained the age of twenty-one, and received\r\nthe dignity of knighthood--probably, as we have before suggested, as a\r\nsubstitute for himself. [Sidenote: A.D. 1463.] The young man had been\r\nsummoned four years before to attend and do military service to King\r\nHenry VI.[213-3] He had since been for some little time a member of King\r\nEdward’s household, travelling about with the court from place to\r\nplace.[213-4] But he had scarcely seen the usual amount of service, and\r\nthough now of full age, and known as Sir John Paston, knight, he was\r\nliving again under his father’s roof, wasting his time, as it was\r\nconsidered, in inglorious ease. ‘At reverence of God, take heed,’ wrote\r\nsome one to his father, ‘for I hear much talking thereof. . . . Some say\r\nthat he and ye stand both out of the king’s good grace, and some say\r\nthat ye keep him at home for niggardship, and will nothing spend upon\r\nhim; and so each man says his advice as it pleases him to talk. And I\r\nhave inquired and said the most cause is in party for cause ye are so\r\nmuch out, that he is rather at home for the safeguard of the\r\ncoasts.’[213-5]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 213-3: No. 377.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 213-4: Nos. 477, 478, 511.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 213-5: No. 550.]\r\n\r\nThe protection of the coast, especially about Yarmouth, might well be an\r\nobject in which John Paston was specially concerned, for close to\r\nYarmouth lay Caister Castle. And he had actually procured a commission\r\nfor his son to be captain of a ship in the king’s service, called the\r\n_Barge of Yarmouth_. But here again he was brought into collision with\r\nGilbert Debenham, who had already procured a commission to the same\r\neffect for himself, and this field of usefulness seems to have been cut\r\noff.[214-1] Confinement at home, to superintend his father’s servants,\r\ndid not suit the young man’s tastes. Once before he had displeased his\r\nfather, probably by seeking too much liberty.[214-2] He now not only\r\nsought it, but took it without leave. [Sidenote: He leaves home.]\r\nWithout signifying his intention to any one, he stole away from Caister,\r\napparently with the view of joining himself again to the king’s\r\nhousehold. In passing by Lynn, he wrote a penitent letter to his mother,\r\nexpressing his fear that he had done wrong, and given her uneasiness.\r\nAnd, in truth, she was by no means pleased; for hitherto in their little\r\ndisagreements she had stood between him and his father, and now her own\r\npast efforts at conciliation caused his father to suspect that she had\r\nbeen privy to his escape. If on any occasion Margaret Paston ever\r\ndeceived her husband, it must have been for the sake of shielding one of\r\nher sons; but we are not warranted in believing even this. The\r\nimputation in this instance was certainly untrue; but so great was the\r\noffence taken by the father, that she durst not even let him know that\r\nshe had received a letter from her son since his departure. She,\r\nhowever, wrote to the runaway, and charged him, as he valued her\r\nblessing, to do all in his power to recover his father’s goodwill. He\r\nmust write to his offended parent again and again in the most humble\r\nterms he could think of, giving him all the news from court, and taking\r\nfar more pains than he had done at home to avoid incurring\r\nexpenses.[214-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 214-1: Nos. 521-3.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 214-2: Nos. 375, 377.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 214-3: No. 552.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John Paston the youngest.] For his second son John’s setting\r\nout in life, the father had made better provision than for his eldest.\r\nHe had succeeded in getting him placed in the household of the new Duke\r\nof Norfolk, the last of the Mowbrays, who succeeded his father towards\r\nthe close of the year 1461, the first year of King Edward’s reign. It\r\nwas the preceding duke who had occupied Caister just before the\r\ncoronation; but he died on the 6th November following, at the beginning\r\nof Edward’s first Parliament, when his son and heir had just attained\r\nthe age of seventeen.[215-1] John Paston the father evidently hoped to\r\nhave the young duke for his friend, and so to maintain himself in\r\nundisturbed possession of the lands which he claimed under Sir John\r\nFastolf’s will. His son must have been as nearly as possible of the same\r\nage as the young nobleman, in whose service he was placed, and he was\r\nsoon made familiar with the stir and bustle of life. At first he went\r\ndown with the duke to his castle of Holt, in Wales, where he expected to\r\nkeep his Christmas. The young duke, who was already married, being\r\ndesired by the king to repair thither for the quiet of the country, had\r\nleft his wife behind him, but after a while proposed to send for her to\r\nkeep Christmas in Wales along with him. This intention, however, he was\r\ncompelled to abandon. At that very time Queen Margaret had come out of\r\nFrance, and had won the castle of Bamborough: [Sidenote: Bamborough\r\nCastle taken by Margaret of Anjou.] and though Warwick was sent to the\r\nnorth as the king’s lieutenant, and the king himself was following with\r\nan army of his own, it was shortly afterwards determined that the Duke\r\nof Norfolk also should repair into Northumberland. [Sidenote: A.D. 1462.\r\nOct.] The castles of Alnwick, Dunstanborough, and Bamborough were\r\ninvested by the royal forces; but it was fully expected the Scots would\r\nmake a strong attempt to rescue them. The Earl of Warwick’s headquarters\r\nwere at Warkworth, three miles out of Alnwick, but he rode daily to each\r\nof the three castles to superintend the siege operations at each. The\r\nDuke of Norfolk had the task assigned him to conduct the victuals and\r\nordnance from Newcastle. The king himself lay at Durham; and young John\r\nPaston had an opportunity of making acquaintance with a number of\r\ninfluential persons, including the Lord Hastings and Lord Dacres, who\r\nhad continual access to the presence of their sovereign. Altogether,\r\nJohn Paston the youngest had certainly begun the world well.[215-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 215-1: Fabyan. _Inquisition p. m._, 1 Edward IV., No.\r\n    46.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 215-2: Nos. 532, 533.]\r\n\r\nOf the other children of John and Margaret Paston it is unnecessary to\r\nsay anything at present. At the time of which we now treat there was\r\nhardly one of them far advanced beyond childhood; nor do they, in fact,\r\noccupy very much attention even in later years, although we shall meet\r\nwith casual notices of one or two of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Troubles of John Paston_\r\n\r\nOn the whole, though the conduct of one of them had not given him entire\r\nsatisfaction, the two eldest sons of John Paston had probably both been\r\nof some service to their father in maintaining his influence at court.\r\nAnd this must have been a matter of no small consequence in the\r\ncontinued struggle that he was obliged to maintain with adversaries like\r\nYelverton and Jenney. The dispute with them had now assumed another\r\nform. [Sidenote: A.D. 1464.] [Sidenote: Litigation touching Fastolf’s\r\nwill.] Sir William Yelverton, in conjunction with our old friend William\r\nWorcester, was contesting in the spiritual court of Canterbury the claim\r\nput forward by Paston to be the chief executor under Sir John Fastolf’s\r\nwill; while at the same time William Jenney, and one William Hogan, by\r\nJenney’s procurement, took actions for trespass against him in the\r\nSuffolk county court. Paston trusted to his influence with the king to\r\ndeliver him from these vexatious suits. He neglected to put in an\r\nappearance at four several county courts, and allowed himself to be put\r\nin exigent, while he followed the king to Marlborough, and obtained from\r\nhim a licence for the erection of the college at Caister provided for in\r\nFastolf’s will. Along with this the king covenanted to give him a free\r\npardon when required for all offences against the peace, to save him\r\nharmless against Yelverton and Jenney; but undertook at the same time to\r\ncause inquiry to be made into the substance of their accusations, and if\r\nthese proved to be unfounded, to compel them to make Paston\r\ncompensation.[216-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 216-1: Nos. 568-9, 571-2.]\r\n\r\nPaston had partly trusted to the friendship of William Calthorpe, who\r\nwas at this time Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk, to protect him against\r\noutlawry. His servant Richard Calle offered surety that Paston would\r\nsave the sheriff harmless, either by making an appearance at a later\r\ndate or by producing a _supersedeas_; and he requested that upon this\r\nassurance the sheriff would return that his master had appeared the\r\nfirst day. Calthorpe had every wish to do Paston a kindness; though he\r\nconfessed that Jenney had been his good friend and legal adviser for two\r\nyears past, Paston was still more his friend than Jenney, and he\r\npromised to do all that was required.[217-1] But this promise he failed\r\nto fulfil. Paston’s non-appearance was proclaimed at four successive\r\ncounty courts at Ipswich; and a writ of exigent was granted against him.\r\nPaston obtained a _supersedeas_ from the king at Fotheringay on the 3rd\r\nAugust; [Sidenote: John Paston outlawed.] but in the end judgment was\r\ngiven against him in Suffolk on the 10th September, and he was\r\nproclaimed an outlaw. On the 3rd November following he was committed to\r\nthe Fleet prison.[217-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 217-1: No. 572.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 217-2: No. 572. Itin. W. Worc., 366. Those who are\r\n    interested in the subject may be referred to the Year Books of\r\n    Mich. and Hil. 4 Edw. iv. for pleadings as to the validity of the\r\n    outlawry and _supersedeas_. These, however, are purely technical\r\n    and of no interest to the general reader.]\r\n\r\n  [[Mich. and Hil. 4 Edw. iv.\r\n  _typography unchanged: expected form “Edw. IV.”_]]\r\n\r\nThis was his second experience of captivity since the death of Sir John\r\nFastolf. We do not know that he ever suffered it before that time; but\r\nhe was now paying the penalty of increased importance. His detention on\r\nthis occasion does not seem to have been of long duration; but if we are\r\nright in the interpretation of a sarcastic anonymous letter[217-3] found\r\namong his correspondence, his fellow-prisoners threw out surmises when\r\nhe left that the Fleet would see him yet a third time within its walls.\r\nAt least, this may or may not have been the purport of what is certainly\r\nan ironical and ambiguous epistle addressed to him, we cannot tell by\r\nwhom. If it was so, the prediction was verified before another\r\ntwelvemonth had passed away.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 217-3: No. 574.]\r\n\r\nHow matters went during the winter we have very little indication,\r\nexcept that Paston’s friend John Wykes, an officer of the king’s\r\nhousehold, [Sidenote: A.D. 1465. Feb. 7.] writes to Margaret Paston on\r\nthe 7th February from London, ‘that my master your husband, my mistress\r\nyour mother, my master Sir John, Mr. William, Mr. Clement, and all their\r\nmen, were in good health when this letter was written, thanked be Jesu;\r\nand also their matters be in a good way, for my Lord Chancellor is their\r\nsingular good lord.’ The crisis in the affairs of the family was\r\ncertainly very serious, when old Agnes Paston, the judge’s widow (for I\r\nhave never found any other lady spoken of as Margaret Paston’s\r\n‘mother’), took the trouble to go up to London to see them settled. It\r\nappears that there was a little family council on the occasion, and John\r\nPaston’s two brothers, William and Clement, together with his son Sir\r\nJohn, were also present.[218-1] What kind of arrangement they all\r\nsucceeded in making we have no means of ascertaining; but the next\r\noccasion of trouble to John Paston was not given by Yelverton and\r\nJenney.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 218-1: No. 576.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Duke of Suffolk lays claim to Drayton.] The first\r\nindications of it appear in a letter of Margaret Paston to her husband,\r\nwritten on the 8th April 1465, by which we find that the Duke of Suffolk\r\nhad now set up a claim to Sir John Fastolf’s manor of Drayton, about\r\nfour miles north-west of Norwich. Margaret had also heard that he had\r\nbought up the rights of a person named Brytyeff or Bryghtylhed, who laid\r\nclaim to the neighbouring manor of Hellesdon, a little nearer the city,\r\nand that he intended to take possession after Easter.[218-2] The claim\r\nappears to have been very ill founded, and the tenants, all but one or\r\ntwo, were favourable to Paston.[218-3] Nevertheless Philip Lipyate, the\r\nduke’s bailiff, began taking distresses, and carried off the horses of\r\none Dorlet as he was about to yoke them to his plough. But Margaret\r\nPaston, who had been staying at Caister, after waiting till her son Sir\r\nJohn could come to her, and leaving him to keep the castle, went over to\r\nHellesdon to collect the rents for her husband, and put a stop, if\r\npossible, to the proceedings of the duke’s officers. She soon began to\r\nfeel that there was more need of a captain like her son Sir John at\r\nHellesdon than at Caister. One single tenant named Piers Warin gave her\r\nservants a little trouble, and they took from him two mares as security\r\nfor the rent. Warin made his complaint to Philip Lipyate and the duke’s\r\nbailiff of Cossey, who came with a body of eightscore men in armour, and\r\ntook away the plough-horses of the parson and another tenant, intimating\r\nthat the beasts should not be restored unless their owners would appear\r\nand give answer to certain matters at Drayton on the Tuesday following.\r\nThe duke’s men further threatened that if Paston’s servants ventured to\r\ntake any further distresses in Drayton, even if it were but of the value\r\nof a hen, they would take the value of an ox in Hellesdon.[219-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 218-2: No. 578.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 218-3: Nos. 579, 584.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 219-1: Nos. 579, 581.]\r\n\r\nJohn Paston, though not at this time in confinement, seems to have been\r\nunable to leave London. But it was impossible that he could\r\nunderestimate the danger in which his property stood from the\r\npretensions of such a formidable neighbour as the Duke of Suffolk. The\r\nletters written to him at this period by his wife are annotated all down\r\nthe margin with very brief rough jottings in his own handwriting, for\r\nthe most part only calling attention to the subjects touched upon in the\r\nletter, but occasionally indicating what he was about to say in his\r\nreply. He expressed, indeed, no great respect for the big threats of\r\nSuffolk’s officers about taking the value of an ox for that of a hen,\r\nwhich he characterised in the margin by the simple monosyllable ‘crack’;\r\nbut he noted, in the brief words ‘Periculum Heylesdon,’ the fact that\r\nthere was real cause for anxiety lest the duke, who had already occupied\r\nDrayton, should drive him out of Hellesdon as well.[219-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 219-2: No. 581.]\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of Norwich had been appealed to, as chief justice of the\r\npeace for the county, to use his influence with the Duke of Suffolk’s\r\nofficers, and especially with Philip Lipyate, who was a priest, and\r\nsubject to his jurisdiction, to bring the dispute to a peaceful\r\nsettlement. But John Paston probably trusted more to the fact that he\r\nhad men of his own ready to repel force by force. The parishes of\r\nHellesdon and Drayton are situated on the northern bank of the river\r\nWensum, partly on a low ridge which slopes downward towards the stream.\r\nOpposite to Drayton, on the other side of the river, lay the Duke of\r\nSuffolk’s mansion of Cossey,[219-3] from which, at any time that was\r\nthought advisable, an armed band could be sent along with a distraining\r\nofficer to assert the duke’s alleged rights over the tenants. It was\r\nreally a case of two hostile camps keeping watch upon each other, and\r\neach of them ready to take advantage of the other’s weakness. Not that\r\neither of them pretended to be above the law, but the duke and Paston\r\neach claimed to be lawful owner of the lordships of Hellesdon and\r\nDrayton, and, until any legal settlement could be come to, each was well\r\naware of the importance of maintaining his claim by corresponding acts.\r\nIf the duke could levy a distress, so could Paston. His officers made an\r\ninroad, undeterred by the menaces of the duke’s men, into Drayton, took\r\n77 neat, and brought them home to Hellesdon. The tenants followed,\r\npetitioning to have their cattle back again, but Margaret Paston told\r\nthem they must first pay such duties as they owed to her husband, or\r\nfind security to pay at such a day as she could agree to. An officer of\r\nthe duke named Harleston was at Norwich, and told them that if they\r\neither paid or gave such surety they should be put out of their\r\nholdings. Harleston had a conference with Margaret Paston in the\r\nevening, but she refused to redeliver the distress on any other terms\r\nthan those she had already intimated. This was on a Saturday evening. On\r\nMonday following a replevin was served upon her in the name of\r\nHarleston, who was under-steward of the duchy of Lancaster, on the\r\nground that the cattle had been taken within the fee of the duchy.\r\nMargaret refused to deliver them until she had ascertained whether this\r\nwas actually the case, and on inquiry she found that it was not so. The\r\nbeasts were accordingly still detained in Hellesdon pin-fold, and\r\nPynchemore, the officer who had brought the replevin, was obliged to\r\nreturn to his master. But in the afternoon he came again with a replevin\r\nunder the seal of the sheriff of Norfolk, which it was impossible\r\nlawfully to disobey. So the beasts were at last taken out of the\r\npin-fold and redelivered to the tenants.[220-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 219-3: Now commonly spelt Costessey, but pronounced, as\r\n    it is usually spelt in the Paston Letters, Cossey.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 220-1: No. 583.]\r\n\r\nThis sort of quasi-legal warfare continued for weeks and for months.\r\nAt one time there would be a lull; but again it was reported that the\r\nduke’s men were busier. The duke himself was coming to Cossey, and his\r\nservants boasted openly that he would have Drayton in peace and then\r\nHellesdon.[221-1] And not very long after the duke did come to Norfolk,\r\nraising people on his way both in Norfolk and Suffolk,--for an attack,\r\nas every one knew, on Paston’s stronghold at Hellesdon, which was now\r\nplaced in the keeping of his son Sir John.[221-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 221-1: No. 585.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 221-2: No. 592.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attempt of the duke’s men on Hellesdon.] On Monday the 8th\r\nJuly, Philip Lipyate and the bailiff of Cossey, with about 300 men, came\r\nbefore Hellesdon, but, finding Sir John Paston quite prepared for them,\r\nprofessed they had no intention of attempting to force an entry. For Sir\r\nJohn had a garrison of 60 men within the place, and such a quantity of\r\nguns and ordnance that the assailants would certainly have had the worst\r\nof it. Lipyate and the bailiff, however, informed Sir John that they had\r\na warrant to attach John Daubeney, Wykes, Richard Calle, and some\r\nothers. Sir John replied that they were not within, and if they had been\r\nhe would not have delivered them. Afterwards it was mutually agreed that\r\nthe Duke of Suffolk should dismiss his men and Sir John Paston should do\r\nthe same. But this only transferred the scene of action to Norwich,\r\nwhere Richard Calle was attacked by twelve men in the streets and only\r\nrescued by the sheriff; nor did he escape without the pleasant assurance\r\nthat if he were caught another time he would be put to death, so that he\r\ndid not dare ride out without an escort. Daubeney and Wykes were in a\r\nsimilar state of apprehension, and to crown all, it was said that there\r\nwas to be a special commission to inquire of riots, in which the Duke of\r\nSuffolk and Yelverton would be commissioners. If so, every man that had\r\ntaken Paston’s part was pretty sure of being hanged.[221-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 221-3: No. 593.]\r\n\r\nSir John Paston, however, acquired great credit for having withstood\r\nso numerous a force as Lipyate and the bailiff of Cossey had brought\r\nagainst him. It will be readily understood that his position must have\r\nbeen a strong one. He and his mother were then living at a mansion in\r\nHellesdon, which probably stood on comparatively low ground near the\r\nriver.[222-1] But on the brow of the hill, nearer Drayton, stood a\r\nquadrangular fortress of which the ruins still exist, known at this day\r\nby the name of Drayton Lodge. This lodge lay within what was then called\r\nHellesdon Warren, and commanded the entrance to the property. From its\r\nelevated position it must have been peculiarly difficult to attack. The\r\ncountry around was open heath, and the approach of an enemy could be\r\ndescried distinctly in the distance. From the mansion below, where he\r\nhad quartered his garrison of 60 men, he could doubtless bring up with\r\nease at any time as many as seemed necessary for the defence of the\r\nlodge;[222-2] while from the battlements of the lodge a heavy fire could\r\nbe opened on the advancing foe.[222-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 222-1: At Hellesdon North Hall, the property of Mr.\r\n    J. H. Gurney, old foundations have been recently discovered, which\r\n    are in all probability those of John Paston’s house. The place is\r\n    about 400 yards from Hellesdon Church.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 222-2: One day in the beginning of May as many as sixty\r\n    men were placed in the lodge itself, and kept there all day. At\r\n    that time an attack was continually expected, but not more than\r\n    sixteen or twenty persons could sleep in the building. _See_ No.\r\n    581, at p. 139 (vol. iv.).]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 222-3: ‘The ruined Lodge at Drayton’ is the subject of\r\n    an interesting paper by the late Mr. Henry Harrod in the _Norfolk\r\n    Archæology_, vol. ii. p. 363. There are no remains of battlements\r\n    now, but most probably they once existed.]\r\n\r\nLiving within a house that was threatened with siege, Margaret Paston,\r\nat this juncture, seems to have taken an active part along with her son\r\nin the preparations for defence. Her husband in London writes to her as\r\na commander-in-chief might do to the governor of a besieged fort:--‘In\r\ngood faith ye acquit you right well and discreetly, and heartily to your\r\nworship and mine, and to the shame of your adversaries: and I am well\r\ncontent that ye avowed that ye kept possession at Drayton and so would\r\ndo.’ But the task imposed upon her had impaired her health; and John\r\nPaston, though for some potent reasons he was not able even now to come\r\nto her aid, was anxious to give her every comfort and encouragement in\r\nhis power. ‘Take what may do your ease and spare not,’ he says in the\r\nsame letter; ‘and in any wise take no thought nor too much labour for\r\nthese matters, nor set it not so to your heart that ye fare the worse\r\nfor it. And as for the matter, so they overcome you not with force or\r\nboasting, I shall have the manor surelier to me and mine than the duke\r\nshall have Cossey, doubt ye not.’ In fact, if it were a question of law,\r\nJohn Paston’s title seems to have been greatly superior to any that\r\ncould possibly have been advanced by the duke: in proof of which he\r\npoints out a few facts which he tells his wife she may if she think\r\nproper lay before the Bishop of Norwich. The manor of Drayton had\r\nbelonged to a merchant of London called John Hellesdon, long before any\r\nof the De la Poles held land in Norfolk or Suffolk. It had descended to\r\nhis daughter Alice, and John Paston was able to show his title to her\r\nproperty. On the other hand he traced the pedigree of the Duke of\r\nSuffolk from ‘one William Poole of Hull, which was a worshipful man\r\ngrown by fortune of the world,’ and whose son Michael, the first Earl of\r\nSuffolk, had been so created by King Richard II. since Paston’s father\r\nwas born; and if any of their lineage held the manor of Drayton he would\r\nlose £100, if the duke would be bound in as much to prove the contrary.\r\nBut the duke must not expect him to show his title to one who tried to\r\noust him by violence. On this point John Paston was resolute. ‘Let my\r\nlord of Norwich wit that it is not profitable, nor the common weal of\r\ngentlemen, that any gentleman should be compelled by an entry of a lord\r\nto show his evidence or title to his land, nor I will not begin that\r\nexample ne thraldom, of gentlemen nor of other. It is good a lord take\r\nsad counsel ere he begin any such matter.’[223-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 223-1: No. 595.]\r\n\r\nIt might have been supposed that after the duke’s attempt on Hellesdon,\r\nnothing but impediments of the most serious kind would have prevented\r\nJohn Paston from going down to Norfolk to take charge of his own\r\ninterests and relieve his wife’s anxiety. But it appears that he hardly\r\nexpected to be able to leave London, and in the same letter from which\r\nwe have just been quoting he desires that if he be not home within three\r\nweeks his wife will come to him. In that case she is, before leaving, to\r\nput everything under proper rule both at Caister and Hellesdon, ‘if the\r\nwar hold.’ The state of matters between him and Suffolk was such as\r\ncould only be spoken of as a state of war, even by plain matter-of-fact\r\nJohn Paston. And if the enemy offered peace his wife was to send him\r\nword.\r\n\r\nWhat could have been the obstacle that prevented John Paston leaving\r\nLondon? It appears for one thing that he was at this time called upon to\r\nundergo an examination before the spiritual court of Canterbury, in\r\ndefence of his claim to be Sir John Fastolf’s executor. This alone was,\r\nperhaps, sufficient to detain him, for it was a thing on which his most\r\nimportant interests depended. But there is no doubt that additional\r\nobstacles were raised up for him expressly by the malice of his enemies;\r\n[Sidenote: John Paston imprisoned a third time.] for it could not have\r\nbeen many weeks after his first examination that John Paston again found\r\nhimself a prisoner in the Fleet, and within the walls of that prison his\r\nfurther depositions were taken.[224-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 224-1: No. 606.]\r\n\r\nIt was the malicious ingenuity of Judge Yelverton that had devised the\r\nmeans to inflict upon him this new incarceration. And the means employed\r\nwere such as to make captivity doubly painful and humiliating. The\r\nking’s clandestine marriage to Elizabeth Woodville had taken place in\r\nMay of the preceding year. At Michaelmas it was openly avowed; and if it\r\ndispleased, as no doubt it did, Warwick and the old nobility, even from\r\nthe first, it informed a whole world of time-servers and place-hunters\r\nthat there was a new avenue to fortune in securing the favour of the\r\nWoodvilles. Already Rivers had been created Lord Treasurer and advanced\r\nto the dignity of an earldom. Already marriages had been made for the\r\nqueen’s brothers and sisters, which were evidently provocative of envy,\r\njealousy, and indignation.[224-2] The king’s liberality towards his new\r\nrelations was unbounded, and sycophants were not wanting to suggest to\r\nhim how he might gratify their cupidity, sometimes at the expense of\r\nothers than himself. Sir William Yelverton, accordingly, contrived to\r\nwhisper in the royal ear that the king might fairly dispose of some fine\r\nproperty in Norfolk and Suffolk; for John Paston, who claimed to be the\r\nowner, was come of servile blood, and was really the king’s\r\nbondman.[225-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 224-2: W. Worc. _Annales_, 501, 506.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 225-1: _Itin._ Will. de Worc., 323.]\r\n\r\nThe reader will remember the curious paper[225-2] in which it is set\r\nforth that the grandfather and father of John Paston had held lands in\r\nthe village of Paston, by servile tenures, and that John Paston himself,\r\nwithout having any manor place, was endeavouring to ‘make himself a\r\nlordship there,’ to the prejudice of the duchy of Lancaster. There can\r\nbe little doubt that this statement was drawn up in the year 1465 and\r\nthat its author was Judge Yelverton. He had been at this time\r\nendeavouring to ingratiate himself with Anthony Woodville, Lord Scales,\r\nthe queen’s brother, and it was in the interest of that nobleman that he\r\nmade this attempt to asperse the lineage of the Pastons. [Sidenote: Lord\r\nScales seeks to obtain Caister.] For Lord Scales had begun to cast\r\ncovetous eyes on the magnificent castle at Caister; and if it were but\r\nsatisfactorily shown that John Paston was disqualified from possessing\r\nit, no doubt the king, his brother-in-law, would be only too willing to\r\ngrant it to himself. The case was already prejudged; Caister and the\r\nlordship of Cotton as well were his by anticipation, and some time\r\nbefore Paston was committed to prison it was known that Lord Scales\r\nmeant to ride down into Norfolk and oust him from his property.[225-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 225-2: _See_ pp. 28, 29.]\r\n\r\n  [[pp. 28-29 = letter headed “A remembrance of the worshipful kin\r\n  and ancestry of Paston”]]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 225-3: No. 598. It appears by the city records of\r\n    Norwich, an extract from which, kindly communicated to me by the\r\n    Rev. William Hudson, will be found in the Appendix to this\r\n    Introduction, that Lord Scales arrived in the city ‘a second time’\r\n    towards the close of the year 1465--apparently just before\r\n    Christmas day, for the date was within eighteen days of a document\r\n    dated 10th January, 5 Edward IV.--for the express purpose of\r\n    taking possession of all the goods and chattels of John Paston,\r\n    whom the king had seized as his ‘native.’ This raised an awkward\r\n    question about the privileges of the city, in which John Paston\r\n    possessed a house. But the civic authorities found a way out of\r\n    the difficulty, and agreed that Lord Scales should be allowed to\r\n    enter by the act of John Paston’s feoffees; for it was understood\r\n    that certain aldermen and common council men were co-feoffees\r\n    along with him, of the messuage which he held. Thus the city’s\r\n    liberty was theoretically preserved without offence to the higher\r\n    powers.]\r\n\r\nAlthough John Paston was thus unable to go home, as he wished to do,\r\nneither was Margaret Paston able for some time to go up and see him in\r\nLondon, as he had desired her. Wykes, who had promised to keep\r\npossession of the place at Hellesdon in her absence, did not go down\r\ninto Norfolk so soon as he had intended, but remained in London taking\r\ncare of Paston’s interests in another fashion in conferences with\r\nNevill, Archbishop of York, at that time Lord Chancellor. Perhaps\r\nalready the influence of Archbishop Nevill, like that of his brother the\r\nEarl of Warwick, had begun to decline, and Wykes was really wasting his\r\nlabour in complaining to his lordship of the riotous attempt made by the\r\nDuke of Suffolk’s men at Hellesdon. There was but one pretext on which\r\nthe outrage could be justified,--a matter concerning the payment of 100\r\nmarks, but the money had been paid long ago. His lordship, however,\r\ndurst swear the Duchess of Suffolk had no knowledge of it; and with that\r\nhe left town, promising an answer when he came back next Tuesday.[226-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 226-1: No. 598.]\r\n\r\nBut Margaret Paston, though she could not yet come up to London, did not\r\nspend the time at home unprofitably. The judges had come down to Norwich\r\non their circuit, when Margaret endeavoured to secure the advantage she\r\nhad already gained in keeping possession at Drayton by getting a manor\r\ncourt held there in her husband’s name. But to do this she required the\r\nservices of one or more faithful dependants who did not mind incurring a\r\nlittle personal risk in the interest of John Paston. Not many,\r\ncertainly, were disposed to undertake the task. John Paston had written\r\nto his wife to have a body of men to escort the officer that would keep\r\nthe court for him. But upon consultation it was thought better to keep\r\nall the men they could in reserve, as the duke’s officers had no less\r\nthan 500 men ready to take advantage of the opportunity to force an\r\nentry into Hellesdon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attempt of Margaret Paston to hold a court at Drayton.]\r\nThomas Bond and an attached and confidential priest named Sir James\r\nGloys were adventurous enough to go to Drayton alone for the purpose of\r\nholding a court on Lammas Day. They found, as might have been expected,\r\nthat officers of the Duke of Suffolk were there before them. Harleston,\r\nalong with Philip Lipyate, the parson of Salle, and William Yelverton,\r\na grandson of the judge, who was to sit as steward, were in the courtyard\r\nof the manor, prepared to hold the court in the Duke of Suffolk’s name.\r\nThey were accompanied by about sixty persons or more, besides the\r\ntenants of Drayton, some having rusty poleaxes and bills to enforce\r\nrespect for the duke’s authority. In the face of this array, however,\r\nBond and Gloys announced that they came to keep the court in the name of\r\nJohn Paston; on which the former was immediately delivered into the\r\ncustody of William Ducket, a new bailiff of Drayton appointed by the\r\nduke, and was carried off to Cossey, his arms bound behind him with\r\nwhipcord like a thief. But Margaret Paston spoke with the judges next\r\nmorning before they went to the shirehouse, in presence of the bailiff\r\nof Cossey and the whole of the duke’s council; and the judges calling\r\nthe bailiff before them, gave him a severe reproof, and sent the sheriff\r\nto see what company had been mustered at Drayton. The sheriff rode first\r\nto Hellesdon, and expressed himself satisfied with the demeanour of\r\nPaston’s men there. When he came to Drayton, the bands of Suffolk’s\r\nretainers had disappeared. He demanded that Thomas Bond should be\r\ndelivered to him, and was told that he had been sent to the Duke of\r\nSuffolk; but he was afterwards delivered to him at Norwich, with a\r\nrequest that he should not be set at liberty without a fine, as he had\r\ntroubled the king’s leet. The judges, however, on being informed of the\r\nreal state of the case, commanded him to be set at liberty, and\r\npronounced a very strong censure on the conduct of Suffolk’s\r\nofficers.[227-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 227-1: No. 599.]\r\n\r\nAs for the manors of Caister and Cotton, it does not appear that Lord\r\nScales ever carried out his intention so far as the latter was\r\nconcerned; nor had he taken possession even of the former some time\r\nafter John Paston was committed to the Fleet. That occurrence must have\r\ntaken place about the middle of the month of August,[227-2] and towards\r\nthe end of September we have evidence that Sir John Paston was in\r\nCaister Castle keeping possession for his father.[227-3] But the Paston\r\nfamily had been warned of the danger, and we may be well assured that\r\nthey did not neglect the warning in either case. Indeed, the question\r\nhow to make matters secure at Caister seems to have been the principal\r\ndifficulty that caused Margaret to delay her journey up to London. As to\r\nCotton, we shall see ere long that very effectual means were taken to\r\nsecure possession there.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 227-2: On the 18th August Margaret Paston was still\r\n    hoping that her husband would find it possible to come home\r\n    himself, and save her the necessity of going up to London to see\r\n    him. _See_ No. 604. But we know that he was imprisoned before the\r\n    28th of the month. No. 606.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 227-3: No. 610 (vol. iv. p. 192).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Margaret Paston visits her husband in prison.] It would\r\nappear that when Margaret knew her husband was in prison she determined\r\nto delay no longer, but to visit him in London at all costs. Early in\r\nSeptember she had already gone to him, and her son, John Paston the\r\nyoungest, wrote to her from Norwich on the 14th, advising her, among\r\nother things, to visit the Rood of North-door (a cross beside St. Paul’s\r\nCathedral), and St. Saviour’s at Bermondsey, during her stay in the\r\ncapital. ‘And let my sister Margery,’ he suggests, ‘go with you, to pray\r\nto them that she may have a good husband or she come home again.’ It is\r\ndifficult to tell whether this means devotion or sightseeing, jest or\r\nearnest. The young man had already seen a good deal of life, and was\r\nfamiliar with the principal attractions of the great city, to which in\r\nall probability his mother was as great a stranger as his young sister.\r\nEven the dame who had the care of his father’s apartments in the prison\r\nwas not unknown apparently to John Paston the youngest. ‘And the Holy\r\nTrinity,’ he writes, ‘have you in keeping, and my fair Mistress of the\r\nFleet.’\r\n\r\nJohn Paston the father does not seem to have been very uncomfortable in\r\nprison. He made friends in the place of his confinement, and among other\r\npersons became acquainted with Henry, Lord Percy, son of the attainted\r\nEarl of Northumberland, who was afterwards restored by King Edward to\r\nhis father’s earldom. His spirits, indeed, if we may judge from his\r\ncorrespondence, were at this time particularly buoyant; for after his\r\nwife had taken leave of him to return homeward he wrote her a letter the\r\nlatter half of which was composed of doggerel rhyme, jesting about\r\nhaving robbed her portmanteau, and referring her for redress to Richard\r\nCalle, whose ears he bade her nail to the post if he did not pay her the\r\nvalue. In none of his previous correspondence does he indulge in verse\r\nor betray anything of this rollicking humour. The only subject on which\r\nhe even insinuates a complaint is the weather, which seems to have been\r\nunnaturally cold for September. He speaks of it satirically as ‘this\r\ncold winter,’ and wishes his wife to send him some worsted for doublets\r\nin which to protect himself from the severity of the season. But even in\r\nthis we can tell that he is jesting, for he explains himself that he\r\nwishes to have a doublet entirely composed of the wool manufactured at\r\nWorsted, for the credit of his native county. And so far is he from\r\nwishing it for the sake of warmth, that he particularly desires to\r\nprocure a fine quality of worsted ‘almost like silk,’ of which William\r\nPaston’s tippet was composed.[229-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 229-1: No. 609.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Margaret Paston enters Cotton.] On her way back to Norfolk,\r\nMargaret Paston entered the manor of Cotton and remained in it for three\r\ndays. She had sent a message to her son John Paston the youngest at\r\nHellesdon to come and meet her there,[229-2] and he came along with\r\nWykes and twelve others, whom she had left at her departure to keep\r\npossession and collect the rents. It was within a week of Michaelmas\r\nDay, when rents fell due. As yet Lord Scales had made no attempt to\r\nseize upon this property. Sir Gilbert Debenham had occupied the manor\r\nfor some years undisturbed, and he was doubtless considerably taken by\r\nsurprise when he found that a lady on her way home from London had\r\nentered and taken possession in the name of John Paston. But when he\r\nheard that young John Paston was gathering money of the tenants, he\r\nraised a body of 300 men to expel the intruder. Young John Paston was\r\nexpecting reinforcements to his little band from Caister or elsewhere,\r\nbut they did not come; so that his position would have been a critical\r\none had not some one been his friend in the household of the Duke of\r\nNorfolk. Sir Gilbert was the duke’s steward, and John Paston the\r\nyoungest was still in the duke’s service. A yeoman of his lordship’s\r\nchamber represented to that nobleman that there was imminent risk of a\r\nquarrel between two of his men, which would be a great ‘disworship’ to\r\nhis grace. The duke sent for the two immediately to attend upon him at\r\nFramlingham Castle, and proposed to them terms of compromise until the\r\nmatter could be thoroughly investigated. He desired that neither party\r\nshould muster men, that the court should be ‘continued’--that is to say,\r\nadjourned--till he himself should have had an opportunity of speaking\r\nboth with John Paston the father and on the other side with Yelverton\r\nand Jenney, who had conveyed to Debenham the title on which he founded\r\nhis claim to the manor. Meanwhile he proposed that the place should be\r\nkept by some indifferent person to be chosen by both parties.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 229-2: _See_ No. 613. The heading of this letter is\r\n    unfortunately wrong. Deceived by the facsimile to which Fenn\r\n    refers as showing the character of the signature, I attributed the\r\n    letter to Sir John Paston. But Margaret Paston expressly says it\r\n    was John Paston the younger whom she left at Cotton (No. 610), and\r\n    this letter must therefore have been written by him. Besides, the\r\n    writer himself mentions that the dispute with Debenham was\r\n    referred to the Duke of Norfolk to avoid the scandal of a quarrel\r\n    _between two of his men_. It was not Sir John Paston, but his\r\n    brother, that was in the Duke of Norfolk’s service.]\r\n\r\nTo these terms John Paston the youngest would not assent without\r\nconsulting his mother, who had again come over from Norwich, or perhaps\r\nfrom Caister, to see how matters went. But after a conference, they sent\r\nan answer to the duke, declaring that they could not give up possession\r\nof the place, but out of their anxiety for peace, and to satisfy his\r\nlordship, they were willing to desist meanwhile from collecting rents,\r\nif the opposite party would engage not to distrain or keep courts there\r\neither. To this compromise Sir Gilbert said that he agreed, provided it\r\nmet with the approval of Yelverton and Jenney; and the Duke of Norfolk,\r\nwho was going up to London in anticipation of his birthday when he\r\nattained his majority, left all the sooner in the hope of bringing this\r\nmatter to a favourable settlement.[230-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 230-1: Nos. 613, 614.]\r\n\r\nThus far, at least, the entry into Cotton had been a distinct success.\r\nThe compromise was greatly in favour of the Pastons, for an appeal to\r\nforce would almost certainly have gone against them, and, though they\r\nengaged for the time to abstain from taking more money of the tenants,\r\nthey had already succeeded in collecting almost all that they expected\r\nto receive for Michaelmas term.[230-2] So Margaret Paston on her return\r\nto Norfolk, and her son, when he was summoned to London shortly\r\nafterwards, to attend the duke on his coming of age,[231-1] may each\r\nhave left Cotton with feelings akin to triumph. But scarcely had the\r\nformer returned to Norwich when she discovered to her dismay that her\r\nclever manœuvre in Suffolk had left the family interests insufficiently\r\nprotected elsewhere. The Duke of Suffolk had not only a great number of\r\nmen at Cossey, but he had a powerful friend within the city of Norwich.\r\nThomas Elys, the new mayor, was so flagrantly partial, that he had said\r\nat Drayton he would supply my lord of Suffolk with a hundred men\r\nwhenever he should require them, and if any men of the city went to\r\nPaston he would lay them fast in prison.[231-2] Hellesdon,\r\nunfortunately, lay midway between Cossey and the city of Norwich, and as\r\nit was not now assize time there was practically no control over such\r\nmagnates as the Duke of Suffolk and the mayor. So, on the morning of\r\nTuesday the 15th of October, one Bottisforth, who was bailiff for the\r\nduke at Eye, came to Hellesdon, arrested four of John Paston’s servants,\r\nand carried them off to Cossey without a warrant from any justice of the\r\npeace. His intention, he said, was to convey them to Eye prison along\r\nwith as many more of Paston’s adherents as he could lay his hands on.\r\nThat same day the duke came to Norwich with a retinue of 500 men. He\r\nsent for the mayor and aldermen with the sheriffs, and desired them in\r\nthe king’s name to make inquiry of the constables in every ward of the\r\ncity what men had taken part with Paston in recent gatherings. Any such\r\npersons he requested that they would arrest and punish, and send their\r\nnames to him by eight o’clock on the following day. On this the mayor\r\narrested one Robert Lovegold, brasier, and threatened him that he should\r\nbe hanged, though he had only been with Margaret Paston at Lammas, when\r\nshe was menaced by the companies of Harleston and the bailiff of\r\nCossey.[231-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 230-2: No. 613.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 231-1: No. 614.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 231-2: No. 581.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 231-3: No. 616.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attack on Hellesdon.] Scarcely one of Paston’s servants now\r\ndurst openly show himself abroad, and, the duke having the city at his\r\ncommand, his followers made, that same Tuesday, a regular assault on the\r\nplace at Hellesdon. The slender garrison knew that it was madness to\r\nresist, and no opposition was offered. The duke’s men took possession,\r\nand set John Paston’s own tenants to work, very much against their\r\nwills, to destroy the mansion and break down the walls of the lodge,\r\nwhile they themselves ransacked the church, turned out the parson, and\r\nspoiled the images. They also pillaged very completely every house in\r\nthe village. As for John Paston’s own place, they stripped it completely\r\nbare; and whatever there was of lead, brass, pewter, iron, doors, or\r\ngates, or other things that they could not conveniently carry off, they\r\nhacked and hewed them to pieces. The duke rode through Hellesdon to\r\nDrayton the following day, while his men were still busy completing the\r\nwork of destruction by the demolition of the lodge. The wreck of the\r\nbuilding, with the rents they made in its walls, is visible even\r\nnow.[232-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 232-1: Nos. 616, 617.]\r\n\r\nThis was carrying things with the high hand; but it did not improve the\r\nDuke of Suffolk’s popularity at Norwich, and it created no small\r\nsympathy with Paston and his tenants. ‘There cometh much people daily,’\r\nwrote Margaret Paston to her husband, ‘to wonder thereupon, both of\r\nNorwich and of other places, and they speak shamefully thereof. The duke\r\nhad been better than a thousand pound that it had never been done; and\r\nye have the more good will of the people that it is so foully done.’\r\nMargaret was anxious that the effects of the outrage should be seen\r\nbefore winter came on by some one specially sent from the king to view\r\nand report upon the ruin. But no redress was obtained while her husband\r\nlived, and even some years after his death his sons petitioned for it in\r\nvain.\r\n\r\n\r\n_John Paston’s Latter Days_\r\n\r\nThe chagrin and mortification inflicted upon John Paston by an injury\r\nlike this may not unlikely have contributed to shorten his days. The\r\ncorrespondence is scanty from the end of October 1465 till some time\r\nafter his death, which occurred in London in May of the following year.\r\nWe know nothing of the nature of the illness which carried him off; but\r\nthree imprisonments in the course of five years, accompanied with a\r\ngreat deal of anxiety about his newly acquired property, the intrigues\r\nof lawyers and the enmity of great men, must have exercised a depressing\r\ninfluence even on the stoutest heart. He appears to have been released\r\nfrom prison some time before his death, [Sidenote: A.D. 1466.] and was\r\nso far well in February that he had a conference in Westminster Hall\r\nwith William Jenney, who desired at last to come to some agreement with\r\nhim. But the great lawsuit about Fastolf’s will remained still\r\nundecided, and he left to his son Sir John an inheritance troubled by a\r\ndisputed claim. He died on the 21st or 22nd May[233-1] 1466. His remains\r\nwere carried down into Norfolk and buried with great magnificence in\r\nBromholm Abbey.[233-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 233-1: No. 648. I do not know Fenn’s authority for\r\n    saying it was on the 26th May. Perhaps it is only a misprint.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 233-2: No. 637.]\r\n\r\nOf his character we see fewer indications than might have been expected\r\nin a correspondence extending over more than twenty years, and perhaps\r\nwe are in danger of judging him too much from the negative point of\r\nview. A man of business habits and of little humour, but apparently of\r\nelastic spirits and thorough knowledge of the world, he was not easily\r\nconquered by any difficulties or overwhelmed by misfortunes. His early\r\nexperience in that dispute with Lord Molynes about Gresham must have\r\ntaught him, if he needed teaching, the crookedness of the times in which\r\nhe lived, and the hopelessness of trusting to mere abstract right and\r\njustice for the protection of his own interests. But by unwearied\r\nenergy, by constant watchfulness, by cultivating the friendship of Sir\r\nJohn Fastolf and the goodwill of the world in general, he succeeded in\r\nasserting for himself a position of some importance in his native\r\ncounty. That he was, at the same time, grasping and selfish to some\r\nextent, is no more than what we might be prepared to expect; and it\r\nwould seem there were complaints to this effect even among the members\r\nof his own family.[233-3] As a parent he appears to have been somewhat\r\nunamiable and cold-hearted. Yet it is mainly to his self-seeking,\r\nbusinesslike character that we owe the preservation of so valuable a\r\ncorrespondence. He knew well the importance of letters and of documents\r\nwhen rights came to be contested, and he was far more anxious about\r\ntheir security than about all the rest of his goods and chattels.[234-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 233-3: Nos. 644, 645.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 234-1: No. 649.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sir John Fastolf’s will.] Such being the nature of the man,\r\nand his personal history being as we have seen, what are we to say of\r\nthe dark suspicion thrown upon his conduct in one important matter by\r\nhis personal enemy Sir William Yelverton, and even by his quondam friend\r\nWilliam Worcester? If their contention was true, the great addition made\r\nto the fortunes of the Paston family on the death of Sir John Fastolf\r\nwas only due to a successful forgery. The will on which John Paston\r\nfounded his claim to Caister, as well as to the manors of Drayton and\r\nHellesdon, Cotton, Calcotes, and the whole of Fastolf’s lands in the\r\ncounties of Norfolk and Suffolk, was denounced by them as a fabrication\r\nand not the genuine will of Sir John Fastolf. And we must own that there\r\nare many things which seem to make the imputation credible. We have,\r\nunfortunately, only a portion of the depositions taken in the lawsuit,\r\nand these are entirely those of the adverse party, with the exception of\r\ntwo separate and individual testimonies given in Paston’s favour.[234-2]\r\nWe ought, therefore, undoubtedly to be on our guard against attaching\r\nundue weight to the many allegations of perjury and corruption against\r\nPaston’s witnesses, as it is certainly quite conceivable that the\r\ninterested testimony was on the other side, and it is truly shown in\r\nJohn Paston’s own comments upon the evidence that the proofs given were\r\ninsufficient. But, on the other hand, it is a very suspicious\r\ncircumstance that a will drawn up by Fastolf on the 14th June before his\r\ndeath, was altered on the 3rd November so as to confer special powers in\r\nthe administration to John Paston and Thomas Howes, and to give a large\r\nbeneficiary interest to the former.[234-3] It is also singular that\r\nthere should be three separate instruments of this latter date, each\r\nprofessing to be Fastolf’s will.[234-4] And it by no means tends to\r\nallay suspicion when we find that two years after John Paston’s death,\r\nand very shortly before his own, the parson Thomas Howes, a Grey Friar,\r\nand partner with him in the principal charge of the administration of\r\nthe alleged last will, made a declaration ‘for the discharge of his\r\nconscience’ that the document was a fabrication.[235-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 234-2: Nos. 541, 543.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 234-3: No. 385.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 234-4: Nos. 385-387.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 235-1: No. 689.]\r\n\r\nThis evidence might seem at first sight decisive and extremely damaging\r\nto the character of John Paston. But even here we must not be too\r\nprecipitate in our conclusion. It is, for one thing, fairly open to\r\nremark that if this subsequent declaration of Sir Thomas Howes was an\r\nimpeachment of Paston’s honesty, it was no less so of his own; so that\r\nit becomes a question whether he was more honest at the time he was\r\nacting in concurrence with Paston or at the time of his professed\r\nrepentance when he made this declaration. But on the whole we may admit\r\nthat the latter alternative is more probable, and we frankly own it as\r\nour belief that Sir Thomas Howes, in his latter days, felt scruples of\r\nconscience with regard to the part he had taken in defending for his\r\nmaster Paston the validity of what, after all, he considered to be a\r\nquestionable document. Yet what are we to say, in this case, to the\r\ntestimony of another Grey Friar, our old friend Dr. Brackley, who had\r\ndrawn up the final agreement between Fastolf and Paston relative to the\r\ncollege, got it engrossed on indented parchment, read it to Sir John,\r\nand saw him put his seal to it?[235-2] It was Brackley’s dying\r\ntestimony, when he was shriven by Friar Mowth, and informed that there\r\nwere serious imputations on his conduct in reference to this matter,\r\nthat as he would answer before God, in whose presence he was soon to\r\nappear, the will which John Paston produced in court was the genuine\r\nwill of Sir John Fastolf. This testimony, too, he repeated unsolicited\r\nwhen, after seeming to rally for a day or two, he sank again, and saw\r\nhimself once more in the presence of death.[235-3] Truly, if it seem\r\nhard to doubt the declaration of Sir Thomas Howes, it is harder still to\r\ncast suspicion on Brackley’s dying evidence.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 235-2: No. 606 (vol. iv. pp. 183-4).]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 235-3: No. 666.]\r\n\r\nThe true explanation of these discrepancies may, however, involve less\r\nserious charges against the character either of Paston, Brackley, or\r\nHowes than would at first sight appear inevitable. The question was not\r\nreally one about the authenticity of a document, but about the exact\r\nnature of a dying man’s will. The document avowedly had not Fastolf’s\r\nsignature attached; it seems that he was too ill to write. For some\r\nyears before his death I do not find Fastolf’s own signature attached to\r\nany of his letters. The point in dispute was whether it really\r\nrepresented Fastolf’s latest intentions as to the disposal of his\r\nproperty. True, it bore Fastolf’s seal of arms, which Yelverton and\r\nWorcester at first endeavoured to prove must have been affixed to it\r\nafter his death. But Paston seems to have shown most successfully that\r\nthis was impossible, as Fastolf’s seal of arms was at his death\r\ncontained in a purse sealed with his signet, and the signet itself was\r\nat that time taken off his finger, and sealed up in a chest under the\r\nseals of several of the executors.[236-1] Moreover, Paston’s statements\r\nwent to show that the terms of the will were settled in various\r\nconferences with Sir John during the months of September, October, and\r\nthe beginning of November, and that corrections had been made in it by\r\nhis express desire. With all this, however, it may have been a delicate\r\nquestion whether the latest corrections were truly in accordance with\r\nFastolf’s mind, and doubts may have been fairly entertained on the\r\nsubject by Sir Thomas Howes; especially when we consider that on the day\r\nthe will was dated Fastolf was utterly unable to speak articulately, so\r\nthat no one could hear him without putting his ear close to the mouth of\r\nthe dying man.[236-2] With regard to John Paston’s part in the matter,\r\nhe was not present when Fastolf’s seal was put to the document, so that\r\nthe validity of that act rested entirely upon the testimony of others,\r\nparticularly Dr. Brackley. And as to the charge of his ‘fabricating’ the\r\nwill, it was never denied that he drew it up, or took a considerable\r\npart in doing so; the only question is how far he did so in accordance\r\nwith Sir John Fastolf’s own instructions.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 236-1: No. 606 (vol. iv. p. 183).]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 236-2: No. 565 (vol. iv. p. 104); No. 639 (vol. iv. p.\r\n    240).]\r\n\r\nSome important matters of fact, indeed, were asserted by Paston in\r\nsupport of his case, and contested by the opposite side. Among other\r\nthings, it was contended that in the autumn of the year 1457, two years\r\nbefore his death, Sir John Fastolf had actually made estate to John\r\nPaston of the manor of Caister and other lands in Norfolk, and thereupon\r\ngiven him livery of seisin with a view to the foundation of the\r\ncollege:[237-1] also that the will made in 1459 was an imperfect\r\ndocument, in which no executors were named, and to which no seal was\r\nattached.[237-2] If these allegations were true, there was, after all,\r\nno great alteration in Sir John’s intentions during the last two years\r\nof his life. On the other hand, Sir Thomas Howes, in his later\r\ndeclaration, asserts that only a year before Fastolf’s death he had, at\r\nPaston’s desire, urged Sir John to allow Paston to buy three of his\r\nmanors and live in his college; at which proposition the old knight\r\nstarted with indignation, and declared with a great oath, ‘An I knew\r\nthat Paston would buy any of my lands or my goods, he should never be my\r\nfeoffee, nor mine executor.’ But even Howes acknowledges that he was\r\nwilling to allow Paston a lodging for term of his life within the manor\r\nof Caister.[237-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 237-1: Vol. iii. No. 386; vol. iv. Nos. 541, 606 (p.\r\n    183), 639 (p. 237).]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 237-2: No. 606, p. 182 (vol. iv.).]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 237-3: No. 689.]\r\n\r\nThe whole controversy affords certainly an admirable illustration of the\r\ninconvenient state of the law before the passing of the Statute of Uses\r\nin the days of Henry VIII. The hearing of all causes touching the wills\r\nof dead men belonged to the spiritual courts of the Church, which did\r\nnot own the king’s jurisdiction. The king’s courts, on the other hand,\r\nhad cognisance of everything affecting real property. No lands or\r\ntenements could be bequeathed by will, because the courts of common law\r\nwould not give effect to such an instrument. But legal ingenuity had\r\nfound the means to enable wealthy persons to bequeath their lands as\r\nwell as their goods to whomsoever they pleased. A man had only to\r\nexecute a conveyance of his lands to a body of trustees, who thereupon\r\nbecame in law the owners, express provision being made at the same time\r\nthat they were to hold it for his use so long as he lived, and after his\r\ndeath for the use of certain other persons named in his will, or for\r\nsuch purposes as might therein be indicated. By this indirect means a\r\ntitle in lands was very effectually conveyed to a legatee without any\r\nabatement of the original owner’s control over his own property so long\r\nas he lived. But the practice gave rise to a multitude of\r\ninconveniences. Private bargains, legal quibbles and subtleties, crafty\r\ninfluences brought to bear upon dying men, great uncertainty as to the\r\ndestination of certain properties, were among its frequent results. At\r\nthe very last moment, when the dying man, perhaps, was in imperfect\r\npossession of his faculties, mere words, or even a nod or sign, might\r\naffect the title to very large estates. And almost by the very nature of\r\nthe case, wherever a trust was instituted like that of Sir John Fastolf,\r\nall the pettifogging devices of legal chicanery were necessarily brought\r\ninto play, either to establish a title or to contest it.[238-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 238-1: See the preamble to the Statute of Uses, 27 Henry\r\n    VIII. c. 10.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir John Paston_\r\n\r\nSir John Paston now stepped into his father’s place, as heir to Caister\r\nand to Fastolf’s other possessions in Norfolk and Suffolk. But before he\r\ncould vindicate his rights in any part of them it was necessary that he\r\nshould wipe out that stain upon his pedigree which had been devised by\r\ncalumny in bar of the claims made by his father. The case came before\r\nthe king himself in council. An array of court rolls and other ancient\r\nrecords was produced by the family, to show that they had been lords of\r\nthe soil in Paston from a very remote period. Some of their title-deeds\r\nwent back as far as the reign of Henry III., and it was shown that their\r\nancestors had given lands to religious houses in that reign. Indeed, so\r\nlittle truth was there in the imputation that John Paston the father was\r\na bondman, that his ancestors, certainly by the mother’s side if not by\r\nthe father’s also, had been the owners of bondmen. The evidences were\r\nconsidered satisfactory, and the family were declared by the king’s\r\ncouncil to be fully cleared of the imputation. The lands, of which Lord\r\nScales had taken possession for about half a year,[239-1] were restored\r\nto Sir John Paston by a warrant under the king’s signet, dated on the\r\n26th July, little more than two months after the death of John Paston\r\nthe father.[239-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 239-1: _Itin._ W. Worc., 323, where it is said that Lord\r\n    Scales ‘custodivit hospicium in Castre per spacium dimidii . . .’\r\n    The blank must surely be supplied by the word _anni_.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 239-2: Nos. 641, 643.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tournament at Eltham.] After this Sir John Paston was much at\r\ncourt, and Lord Scales became his special friend. Even as early as the\r\nfollowing April we find Sir John taking part in a tournament at Eltham,\r\nin which the king, Lord Scales, and himself were upon one side.[239-3]\r\nBut the favour with which he was regarded at court both by the king and\r\nthe Lord Scales appeared more evidently one year later, [Sidenote: A.D.\r\n1468.] when the king’s sister Margaret went over to the Low Countries to\r\nbe married to Charles, Duke of Burgundy. [Sidenote: Marriage of\r\nMargaret, sister of Edward IV., to Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy.]\r\nThis match had been more than a year in contemplation, and was highly\r\npopular in cementing the friendship of England and Burgundy in\r\nopposition to France. On the 1st May 1467 a curious bargain or wager was\r\nmade by Sir John Paston as to the probability of its taking effect\r\nwithin two years.[239-4] But on the 18th April 1468 he received a\r\nsummons from the king to be prepared to give his attendance on the\r\nprincess by the 1st June following, and to accompany her into\r\nFlanders.[239-5] Not only he, but his brother John Paston the younger,\r\ncrossed the sea in the Lady Margaret’s train; and we are indebted to the\r\nlatter for an interesting account of the marriage and of the tournaments\r\nwhich followed in honour of it. Young John Paston was greatly struck\r\nwith the splendour of the Burgundian court. He had never heard of\r\nanything like it, he said, except the court of King Arthur.[239-6] But\r\nhis brother seems to have found another attraction abroad which\r\nfascinated him quite as much as all the pageants and the tournaments in\r\nhonour of the Lady Margaret.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 239-3: No. 665.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 239-4: No. 667.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 239-5: No. 683.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 239-6: No. 684.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sir John Paston and Anne Haute.] There lived, probably in the\r\ntown of Calais, a certain Mrs. Anne Haute, a lady of English extraction\r\nand related to Lord Scales, whom Sir John Paston seems on this occasion\r\nto have met for the first time. Having been perhaps all her life abroad,\r\nshe appears to have had an imperfect command of the English language; at\r\nleast Sir John, in proposing to open a correspondence, wrote to her,\r\n‘Mistress Annes, I am proud that ye can read English.’ For the rest we\r\nmust not attempt to portray the lady, of whose appearance and qualities\r\nof mind or body we have no account whatever. But perhaps we may take it\r\nfor granted that she was really beautiful; for though Sir John was a\r\nsusceptible person, and had once been smitten before, his friend Daverse\r\ndeclared him to be the best chooser of a gentlewoman that he\r\nknew.[240-1] It is a pity that with this qualification his suit was not\r\nmore successful. It went on for several years, but was in the end broken\r\noff, and Sir John Paston lived and died a bachelor.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 240-1: No. 660.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A troubled inheritance.] But Sir John was heir to the\r\ntroubles of a lawsuit, and his property was continually threatened by\r\nvarious claimants both at Hellesdon and at Caister. His mother writes to\r\nhim on one occasion that Blickling of Hellesdon had come from London,\r\n‘and maketh his boast that within this fortnight at Hellesdon should be\r\nboth new lords and new officers. And also this day Rysing of Fretton\r\nshould have heard said in divers places, there as he was in Suffolk,\r\nthat Fastolf of Cowhaw maketh all the strength that he may, and\r\nproposeth him to assault Caister and to enter there if he may, insomuch\r\nthat it is said that he hath a five-score men ready, and sendeth daily\r\nespies to understand what fellowship keep the place.’ For which reason\r\nMargaret Paston urges her son to send home either his brothers or\r\nDaubeney to command the garrison, for, as he well knew, she had been\r\n‘affrayed’[240-2] there before this time, and she could not ‘well guide\r\nnor rule soldiers.’[240-3] Another time it is intimated to Sir John that\r\nthe Duchess of Suffolk means to enter into Cotton suddenly at some time\r\nwhen few men should know what she is going to do.[240-4] And this\r\nintention she seems to have fully accomplished, for in the beginning of\r\nthe year 1469 the Earl of Oxford sends Sir John a friendly warning that\r\nshe means to hold a court there next Monday with a view to proving that\r\nthe manor of Cotton Hemnales is holden of her by knight’s\r\nservice.[241-1] So that altogether Sir John Paston’s inheritance was\r\nheld by a very precarious tenure, and his mother, like a prudent woman,\r\nadvises him ‘not to be too hasty to be married till ye were more sure of\r\nyour livelode.’[241-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 240-2: That is to say, menaced, if not attacked, an\r\n    ‘affray’ being made upon her. It is curious to meet here our\r\n    familiar word ‘afraid’ in its original form and signification.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 240-3: No. 671.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 240-4: No. 690.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 241-1: No. 696.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 241-2: No. 704.]\r\n\r\nThe old dispute with the executors, however, was compromised in the\r\ncourt of audience: and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Bishop Waynflete,\r\nand Lord Beauchamp granted to Sir John full right in the manor of\r\nCaister, and a number of other lands both in Norfolk and Suffolk.[241-3]\r\nSir John soon afterwards conveyed a portion of the Suffolk property\r\ncalled Hemnales in Cotton and the manor of Haynford to the Duke of\r\nNorfolk and others.[241-4] William Worcester became friends with John\r\nPaston’s widow, imputed his old misunderstanding with her husband to the\r\ninterference of others between them, and expressed himself well pleased\r\nthat Caister was to be at her command. ‘A rich jewel it is at need,’\r\nwrites Worcester, ‘for all the country in time of war; and my master\r\nFastolf would rather he had never builded it than it should be in the\r\ngovernance of any sovereign that would oppress the country.’ At the same\r\ntime it seemed very doubtful whether Fastolf’s intention of founding the\r\ncollege there could be carried out, and Worcester had some conferences\r\nwith Sir John Paston about establishing it at Cambridge. Bishop\r\nWaynflete had already proposed doing so at Oxford; but Cambridge was\r\nnearer to the county of Norfolk, and by buying a few advowsons of\r\nwealthy parsonages an additional foundation might be established there\r\nat considerably less cost than by the purchase of manors. In this\r\nopinion Sir John Paston and William Worcester coincided, and the former\r\npromised to urge it upon Bishop Waynflete.[241-5]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 241-3: No. 675. The deed, perhaps, was found to be\r\n    irregular afterwards, for its general effect was confirmed about\r\n    five months later by another instrument. No. 680.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 241-4: No. 677.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 241-5: No. 681.]\r\n\r\nSir John Paston had now some reason to expect that with the settlement\r\nof this controversy he would have been left for life in peaceful\r\npossession of Caister. That which his father had not been able to attain\r\nwas now apparently conceded to him: and even if Sir William Yelverton\r\nwas still dissatisfied, the other executors had formally recognised his\r\nrights in the court of audience. But before many months had passed it\r\nappeared that Yelverton could still be troublesome, and he found an ally\r\nin one who had hitherto been his opponent. [Sidenote: Sir Thomas Howes\r\nunites with Yelverton,] Sir Thomas Howes was probably failing in\r\nhealth--for he seems to have died about the end of the year\r\n1468[242-1]--when he made that declaration ‘for the discharge of his\r\nconscience’ to which we have already alluded. Scruples seem to have\r\narisen in his mind as to the part he had taken with Sir John Paston’s\r\nfather in reference to the administration of Fastolf’s will, and he now\r\nmaintained that the will nuncupative which he himself had propounded\r\nalong with John Paston in opposition to an earlier will propounded by\r\nYelverton and Worcester, was a fabrication which did not truly express\r\nthe mind of the deceased. We may observe, though the subject is\r\nexceedingly obscure, that of the three wills[242-2] printed in Volume\r\nIII., each of which professes to be the will of Sir John Fastolf, the\r\nthird, which is in Latin, is clearly a will nuncupative declaring the\r\ntestator’s mind in the third person, and defining the powers of the\r\nexecutors in regard to his goods and chattels.[242-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 242-1: _See_ preliminary note to No. 703.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 242-2: Nos. 385-7.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 242-3: The other two have relation to his lands, and are\r\n    not inconsistent with each other; but the first is drawn up in the\r\n    name of the testator himself, while the second speaks of him in\r\n    the third person. The second is, in fact, a note of various\r\n    instructions given by the testator in reference to his property on\r\n    the 2nd and 3rd days of November before he died, and its contents\r\n    may have been fully embodied in the first, when the will was\r\n    regularly drawn up; but the first is printed from a draft which is\r\n    probably imperfect.]\r\n\r\n  [[Sidenote: Sir Thomas Howes unites with Yelverton,\r\n  _not an error: sentence continues below_]]\r\n\r\nIt was apparently this nuncupative will that Howes declared to be\r\nspurious. The validity of the others touching his lands depended upon\r\nthe genuineness of a previous bargain made by Fastolf with John Paston,\r\nwhich was also disputed. But it was the nuncupative will that appointed\r\nten executors and yet gave John Paston and Thomas Howes sole powers of\r\nadministration, except in cases where those two thought fit to ask their\r\nassistance. This will seems to have been drawn up mainly by the\r\ninstrumentality of one Master John Smyth, whom Howes afterwards\r\ndenounced as ‘none wholesome counsellor.’[243-1] Howes now combined with\r\nYelverton in declaring it to be spurious.[243-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 243-1: No. 681.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 243-2: Nos. 688-9.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: and they sell Caister to the Duke of Norfolk.] The result of\r\nthis allegation was that Yelverton and Howes took it upon them, as\r\nexecutors of Sir John Fastolf, to recommend to Archbishop Bourchier that\r\nthe Duke of Norfolk should be allowed to purchase the manor of Caister\r\nand certain other lands in Norfolk, and that the money received for it\r\nshould be spent in charitable deeds for the good of Fastolf’s soul. The\r\ntransaction was not yet completed,[243-3] but the duke immediately\r\nproceeded to act upon it just as if it were. He did not, indeed, at once\r\ntake possession of the place, but he warned the tenants of the manor to\r\npay no money to Sir John, and his agents even spoke as if they had the\r\nking’s authority. On the other hand, Sir John had the support of\r\npowerful men in the king’s council--no less persons than the great Earl\r\nof Warwick and his brother, the Archbishop of York, who had lately been\r\nLord Chancellor, and was hoping to be so again. The Earl of Warwick had\r\nspoken about the matter to the duke even in the king’s chamber, and the\r\narchbishop had said, ‘rather than the land should go so, he would come\r\nand dwell there himself.’ [Sidenote: Archbishop Nevill.] ‘Ye would\r\nmarvel,’ adds the correspondent who communicates the news to Sir John\r\nPaston, ‘ye would marvel what hearts my lord hath gotten and how this\r\nlanguage put people in comfort.’ It had its effect upon the Duke of\r\nNorfolk, who saw that he must not be too precipitate. He was urged on,\r\nit seems, by the duchess his wife, but he would go and speak to her and\r\nentreat her.[243-4]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 243-3: ‘The bargain is not yet made,’ says an anonymous\r\n    writer on the 28th October. _See_ No. 690. Nevertheless an\r\n    ostensible title had been conveyed to the duke by a formal\r\n    document on the 1st October. _See_ No. 764.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 243-4: Nos. 688, 690.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Yelverton and Howes seem to have been pretty\r\nconfident that my Lord of York would not be chancellor again unless\r\ntheir bargain with the duke was ratified. The Nevills were no longer\r\nregarded with favour at court. The coolness which had existed between\r\nthe king and Warwick ever since the marriage with Elizabeth Woodville\r\nhad last year come to an open rupture, and the Archbishop of York had\r\nbeen at the same time dismissed from the office of chancellor. Soon\r\nafter the new year a reconciliation was effected through the medium of\r\nprivate friends, and the archbishop conducted his brother the Earl of\r\nWarwick to the king at Coventry.[244-1] But real confidence was not\r\nrestored, and party spirit was anxious that it never should be. Nor\r\ncould the public at large, perhaps, imagine the deep grounds of distrust\r\nthat Warwick had already given to his sovereign.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 244-1: W. Worc., 512-13.]\r\n\r\nSir John Paston, nevertheless, was advised to put his trust chiefly in\r\nthe friendship of the Nevills and in the probable reinstatement of the\r\narchbishop as Lord Chancellor. Another means, however, was not to be\r\nneglected. Sir Thomas Howes might be gammoned, or bullied, or got over\r\nin some way. He and Yelverton did not agree so well that it need be a\r\nvery hard matter to separate them. Sir John’s friends hoped to secure\r\nfor him the good offices of the Bishop of Ely and a certain Master\r\nTresham, who, it was thought, could put it nicely to Sir Thomas Howes\r\nhalf in jest and half in earnest, putting him ‘in hope of the moon shone\r\nin the water,’ and telling him that such efforts were made ‘that either\r\nhe should be a pope, or else in despair to be deprived _de omni\r\nbeneficio ecclesiastico_ for simony, lechery, perjury, and double\r\nvariable peevishness, and for administering without authority.’ Such\r\nwere a few of the humours of the controversy.[244-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 244-2: No. 690.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sir John ‘wages’ men. A.D. 1469.] Better, however, than the\r\nfriendship of the great, was the security to be derived from keeping\r\nCaister well guarded; and Sir John Paston immediately set about ‘waging’\r\nmen to add to the little garrison.[244-3] With this he seems to have\r\nbeen much occupied from November till January following, when by\r\nrepeated letters from the king he was commanded to desist from making\r\nany assembly of the lieges, and to appear personally before the council\r\nat Westminster.[244-4] The matter, apparently, was hung up for a time\r\nwithout any decision being come to by the council. The friendship of\r\nArchbishop Nevill could have done little to recommend the cause of Sir\r\nJohn Paston to the king. On the other hand, if favour had anything to do\r\nwith the result, his cause was warmly advocated by Lord Scales, the\r\nking’s own brother-in-law, on account of Sir John’s intended marriage\r\nwith his kinswoman, Anne Haute.[245-1] And it is certain that Judge\r\nYelverton had conferences with Lord Scales in the hope of coming to some\r\nkind of understanding. But King Edward, as we have already said, had a\r\nreal desire to be impartial in the disputes and quarrels of his\r\nsubjects; and doubtless it was from a feeling of this that Sir John\r\nPaston and his mother rejoiced to hear that it was the king’s intention\r\nto visit Norwich in the course of the ensuing summer. The rumour of this\r\nintention, it was believed, had a powerful influence in inducing the\r\nDuchess of Suffolk to remain at her family seat at Ewelme, in\r\nOxfordshire, that she might be out of the way if sent for by the king,\r\nand plead age or sickness as her excuse.[245-2] The attempt made by her\r\nson to dispossess Sir John Paston at Hellesdon could best be judged of\r\non the spot. And in Norfolk, too, the king would learn what was thought\r\nof the Duke of Norfolk’s claim to Caister.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 244-3: No. 691.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 244-4: No. 698.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 245-1: Nos. 704, 706, 707.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 245-2: No. 704.]\r\n\r\nSo it was hoped that the king’s presence in the county would tell most\r\nfavourably on Sir John Paston’s interests. And there was one\r\ncircumstance in particular of which advantage might be taken. As Edward\r\nwas to go from Norwich on pilgrimage to Walsingham, his way would of\r\nnecessity lie through Hellesdon and Drayton. The lodge whose walls the\r\nDuke of Suffolk had caused to be broken down could hardly fail, from its\r\nconspicuous position, to meet his eye, and perhaps some friend in the\r\nking’s suite could be got to call his attention to it and tell him the\r\nstory of the outrage. This Thomas Wingfield engaged to do, and promised\r\nto get the king’s own brother, the Duke of Gloucester, to join him in\r\npointing out the ruin. Promises were also obtained from Earl Rivers, the\r\nqueen’s father, and from her brother Lord Scales and Sir John Woodville,\r\nthat they would urge the king to command the Dukes of Norfolk and\r\nSuffolk to forbear claiming title to the lands of Sir John Fastolf. And\r\nby the time the king took his departure from Norwich the Pastons were\r\nencouraged to believe that steps had already been taken to end their\r\ncontroversy with one if not with both dukes. Unfortunately the belief,\r\nor at least the hope that it gave rise to, proved to be utterly\r\nunfounded.[246-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 246-1: No. 716.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The ruined lodge is shown to the king.] The king rode through\r\nHellesdon Warren on his way, as it had been expected that he would do.\r\nThe ruined lodge was pointed out to him by William Paston, Sir John’s\r\nuncle; but his answer was altogether at variance with what the\r\nWoodvilles had led them to expect. The king said the building might have\r\nfallen by itself, and if it had been pulled down, as alleged, the\r\nPastons might have put in bills at the session of _Oyer and Terminer_\r\nheld by the judges when he was at Norwich. William Paston replied that\r\nhis nephew had been induced to hope the king himself would have procured\r\nan amicable settlement with both the dukes, and therefore had forborne\r\nto vindicate his rights by law. But the king said he would neither treat\r\nnor speak for Sir John, but let the law take its course.[246-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 246-2: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Civil War--Public and Private_\r\n\r\nPossibly on the eve of his departure from Norwich, the king had heard\r\nnews which took away all disposition he might once have entertained to\r\nhear personally complaints against such noblemen as the Dukes of Norfolk\r\nand Suffolk. [Sidenote: Robin of Redesdale’s rebellion.] It was just\r\nabout the time of the insurrection of Robin of Redesdale in Yorkshire--a\r\nmovement got up under fictitious names and really promoted by the\r\ndiscontented Earl of Warwick. From the day that Edward IV. had announced\r\nhimself a married man, and disconcerted the subtle promoters of an\r\nalliance with France through the medium of the French king’s\r\nsister-in-law, Bona of Savoy,[246-3] the Earl of Warwick had not only\r\nlost his old ascendency in the king’s councils, but had seen his policy\r\naltogether thwarted and his own selfish interests continually set aside.\r\nHe had been from the first in favour of an amicable compromise of the\r\ndispute with France, while the young king owed not a little of his\r\npopularity to the belief that he would maintain the old pretensions of\r\nEngland, and vindicate them if necessary upon the field of battle.\r\nDisappointed of one mode of promoting a French alliance, he had been\r\ndisappointed still further in 1467, when the king, to humour his\r\ninclinations for a while, sent him over to France on embassy. The result\r\nwas that he was magnificently entertained by Louis XI., captivated by\r\nthe bland familiarity of the French monarch, and became for ever after\r\nhis most ready and convenient tool. If he had anything to learn before\r\nin the arts of diplomacy and statecraft, he came back from France a\r\nmost accomplished scholar. Edward, however, pursued a course of his own,\r\ntreated the French ambassadors in England with rudeness, and cultivated\r\ninstead a close alliance with Burgundy, the formidable rival and lately\r\nthe enemy of Louis. He contracted his sister Margaret to the Duke of\r\nBurgundy’s eldest son, Charles, Count of Charolois, who became duke\r\nhimself in the following year, when the marriage was solemnised at\r\nBruges with a splendour no court in Europe could have rivalled. To crown\r\nall, he announced in Parliament just before the marriage an intention to\r\ninvade France in person.[247-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 246-3: The story that the Earl of Warwick had gone to\r\n    France to negotiate the marriage of Edward with Bona of Savoy,\r\n    when Edward frustrated his diplomacy by marrying Elizabeth\r\n    Woodville, is certainly not in accordance with facts. But the\r\n    doubts of some modern historians that the project of such a match\r\n    was ever entertained are quite set at rest by the evidence of two\r\n    letters which have been recently printed in some of the\r\n    publications of the Société de l’Histoire de France, to which\r\n    attention is called by Mr. Kirk in his _History of Charles the\r\n    Bold_ (vol. i. p. 415 note, and ii. p. 15 note). It appears that\r\n    although the earl had not actually gone to France, he was expected\r\n    there just at the time the secret of the king’s marriage was\r\n    revealed. Nor can there be a reasonable doubt--indeed there is\r\n    something like positive evidence to prove--that the first cause of\r\n    the Earl of Warwick’s alienation from the king arose out of this\r\n    matter. I ought to add that the merit of placing before us for the\r\n    first time a clear view of the consequences of Edward IV.’s\r\n    marriage, in its bearing alike on the domestic history of England\r\n    and on Edward’s relations with France and Burgundy, is due to Mr.\r\n    Kirk.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 247-1: W. Worc., 513-14.]\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Warwick dissembled. Charles of Burgundy was the man he hated\r\nmost,[247-2] but he conducted the Princess Margaret to the coast on her\r\nway to Flanders. A number of personal wrongs and disappointments also\r\nrankled in his breast, and gave birth to sinister projects for\r\ngratifying a wounded ambition, and taking revenge upon an ungrateful\r\nking, who owed it in no small degree to himself that he was king at all.\r\nAs yet Edward was without an heir-male. He had two daughters;[248-1] but\r\nin the succession a brother might perhaps be preferred to a female.\r\nWarwick could marry his eldest daughter to George, Duke of Clarence, and\r\nencourage that vain prince in his expectation of the crown. The earl was\r\ngovernor of Calais. At midsummer in the year 1469 the Duke of Clarence\r\nstole across the sea without the leave of his brother, and landed in a\r\nterritory where Warwick was like an independent king. There the wedding\r\nwas celebrated by the Archbishop of York, the Earl of Warwick’s brother.\r\nSoon after it was over, the duke, the earl, and the archbishop returned\r\nto England.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 247-2: _Contin. of Croyland Chronicle_, p. 551.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 248-1: The two eldest daughters of Edward IV. were born\r\n    in the years 1465 and 1466; the third, Cecily, in the latter end\r\n    of 1469. _See_ Green’s _Princesses_, vol. iii.; also an article by\r\n    Sir Frederic Madden, in the _Gentleman’s Magazine_ for 1831 (vol.\r\n    ci. pt. i., p. 24).]\r\n\r\nAnd now it was that the king, after leaving Norwich and visiting the\r\nfamous shrine at Walsingham, found himself compelled to turn his steps\r\nnorthwards and face the insurrection that had been secretly stirred up\r\nby Warwick and his own brother. It appears by the Privy Seal dates that\r\nhe had reached Lynn on the 26th June.[248-2] He passed on through\r\nWisbeach with a company of two hundred horse to Crowland Abbey, where he\r\nstayed a night, and sailed from thence through the fenny country up the\r\nNen to his father’s castle of Fotheringay, one of his own favourite\r\nresidences.[248-3] From thence, when a number of troops had flocked to\r\nhis standard from all parts of the kingdom, he marched northwards to\r\nNottingham; where, apparently, he learned, to his no little\r\nmortification, that his brother Clarence was in alliance with the Earl\r\nof Warwick and Archbishop Nevill, and that it was questionable whether\r\nthey had not too good an understanding with the rebels in the North.\r\nThat such was the actual fact we know to a certainty. The insurgents\r\ndisseminated papers complaining that the kingdom was misgoverned, in\r\nconsequence of the undue influence of the queen’s relations and one or\r\ntwo other councillors, who had impoverished the crown by procuring large\r\ngrants of crown lands to themselves, and who had caused the king to\r\ntamper with the currency and impose inordinate taxes. Worst of all, they\r\nhad estranged the true lords of the king’s blood from his secret\r\ncouncil, and thereby prevented any check being placed on their rapacity\r\nand misconduct.[249-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 248-2: He seems to have left Norwich on the 21st. There\r\n    are Privy Seals dated on that day, some at Norwich and some at\r\n    Walsingham.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 248-3: _Contin. Chron. Croyl._ p. 542.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 249-1: _See_ the petition printed by Halliwell in his\r\n    notes to _Warkworth’s Chronicle_, pp. 47-51.]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Clarence, with Warwick and the archbishop, had no sooner\r\nlanded from Calais, than copies of these manifestoes were laid before\r\nthem, which they took it upon them to regard in the light of a petition\r\ncalling upon the lords of England generally, and themselves in\r\nparticular, to redress the evils of the state. They declared the\r\npetition just and reasonable, promised to lay it before the king, and by\r\na proclamation under their signets, dated the 12th day of July, called\r\nupon all who loved the common weal to meet them at Canterbury on Sunday\r\nfollowing, armed and arrayed to the best of their power.[249-2] Three\r\ndays before the date of this proclamation, the king at Nottingham had\r\naddressed letters to the duke, earl, and archbishop separately, desiring\r\ncredence for Sir Thomas Montgomery and Maurice Berkeley, and expressing\r\na hope that the current rumour as to their intentions was\r\nerroneous.[249-3] A hope altogether vain. The king was surrounded with\r\nenemies, and no plan of action could be arranged among his friends.\r\nHerbert, Earl of Pembroke, whom he had summoned from Wales, met at\r\nBanbury with Humphrey, Lord Strafford of Southwick, lately created Earl\r\nof Devonshire,[249-4] who came out of Devonshire to do battle with the\r\nrebels. But the two leaders had a dispute about quarters; the Earl of\r\nDevonshire withdrew eight or ten miles back; and Sir William Conyers,\r\nthe rebel captain, who had adopted the name Robin of Redesdale,\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Hedgecote, 26th July.] came down upon the Earl of\r\nPembroke and defeated him with great slaughter. The earl himself and his\r\nbrother Sir Richard Herbert were taken prisoners, and were shortly\r\nafterwards put to death at Coventry, along with Lord Rivers and his son\r\nSir John Woodville, who were about the same time captured in the Forest\r\nof Dean in Gloucestershire. They had parted from the king in alarm\r\nbefore he came to Nottingham, and fled for safety towards Wales; but\r\ntheir flight was to no purpose. [Sidenote: The king taken prisoner.]\r\nBefore their execution--apparently some time during the month of\r\nAugust--the king himself was taken prisoner near Coventry by the\r\nconfederate lords, and led to Warwick Castle; from which place he was,\r\nsoon after his committal, transferred to Middleham, another castle of\r\nthe Earl of Warwick, in Yorkshire.[250-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 249-2: _See_ the proclamation immediately preceding the\r\n    above petition in the notes to _Warkworth’s Chronicle_, pp. 46-7.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 249-3: No. 719.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 249-4: No. 714.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 250-1: _Contin. Chron. Croyl._ pp. 542, 551. There are\r\n    Privy Seals dated on the 2nd August at Coventry; on the 9th, 12th,\r\n    and 13th at Warwick; and on the 25th and 28th at Middleham.]\r\n\r\nHe was shortly afterwards released, and arrived in London in the\r\nbeginning of October. It was not easy to say what to do with such a\r\nprisoner, and Warwick thought it best to let him go. He had done enough\r\nfor the present to show his power and wreak his revenge upon the\r\nWoodvilles; and Edward, even when he was set at liberty, saw clearly\r\nthat prudence required him to forget the affront and not show himself in\r\nany way offended.[250-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 250-2: No. 736.]\r\n\r\nBut what kind of order could have prevailed throughout the kingdom at a\r\ntime when the king was a captive in the hands of his own subjects? For\r\nthe most part we know nothing of the facts, but perhaps we may judge to\r\nsome extent from what took place in a small corner of the county of\r\nNorfolk. [Sidenote: Siege of Caister, A.D. 1469, Aug.] On Monday the\r\n21st August,[250-3] the Duke of Norfolk began to lay a regular siege to\r\nCaister Castle. Sir John Paston was at the time in London, and his\r\nbrother John kept the place as his lieutenant. At first the duke sent\r\nSir John Heveningham, a kinsman of Sir John Fastolf, to demand peaceable\r\nentry, on the ground that he had bought the manor from Fastolf’s\r\nexecutor Yelverton; but on being refused admittance, he surrounded the\r\ncastle with a body of 3000 men.[251-1] Those within were not wholly\r\nunprepared. They had rather more than a month’s supply of victuals and\r\ngunpowder, but they were only a handful of men. Sir John Heveningham,\r\nwho was appointed by the duke one of the captains of the besieging\r\nforce, had hitherto been friendly to the Paston family. He came and\r\nvisited old Agnes Paston at Norwich, and Margaret Paston thought he\r\nmight be induced to show a little favour to messengers coming from\r\nherself or her son Sir John. But this he steadily refused to do, and\r\nmade a very suspicious suggestion for the settlement of the controversy,\r\nwhich he requested Margaret to write to her son Sir John in London.\r\nCould not the duke be allowed to enter peaceably on giving surety to Sir\r\nJohn to recompense all wrongs, if the law should afterwards declare the\r\nright to be in him? ‘Be ye advised,’ wrote Margaret, ‘what answer ye\r\nwill give.’[251-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 250-3: At least William Worcester, in his _Itinerary_,\r\n    p. 321, seems to indicate in very bad Latin that the siege began\r\n    on the Monday before St. Bartholomew’s Day, which in 1469 would be\r\n    the 21st August. Yet a very bewildering sentence just before would\r\n    imply that the siege began either on the Feast of the Assumption\r\n    of the Virgin (15th August) or on St. Bartholomew’s Day itself\r\n    (24th August), and that it lasted five weeks and three days. But\r\n    we know that the castle surrendered on the 26th September, so that\r\n    if the duration of the siege was five weeks and three days it must\r\n    have begun on the 19th August, a different date still. William\r\n    Worcester’s habit of continually jotting down memoranda in his\r\n    commonplace books has been of very great service to the historian\r\n    of this disordered epoch; but his memoranda reflect the character\r\n    of the times in their confusion, inconsistency, and\r\n    contradictions.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 251-1: _Itin._ W. de Worc., 325.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 251-2: No. 720.]\r\n\r\nOther proposals were shortly afterwards made on the duke’s behalf,\r\nnearly the same in character but with somewhat greater show of fairness.\r\nThe place, it was suggested, might be put in the keeping of indifferent\r\nparties, who would receive the profits for the benefit of whoever should\r\nprove to be the true claimant until the right could be determined, the\r\nduke and Paston both giving security not to disturb these occupants in\r\nthe meanwhile. But who could be relied upon as indifferent, or what\r\npower existed in the kingdom to secure impartiality at a time when the\r\nking himself was a prisoner in the hands of his enemies? Margaret Paston\r\ncould but forward these suggestions to her son, with a warning to lose\r\nno time in making up his mind about them. ‘Send word how ye will be\r\ndemeaned by as good advice as ye can get, and make no longer delay, for\r\nthey must needs have hasty succour that be in the place; for they be\r\nsore hurt and have none help. And if they have hasty help, it shall be\r\nthe greatest worship that ever ye had. And if they be not holpen it\r\nshall be to you a great disworship; and look never to have favour of\r\nyour neighbours and friends but if this speed well.’[252-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 252-1: No. 720.]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the only relief which Sir John Paston had it easily in his\r\npower to obtain for the garrison was not in the shape of succours. Sir\r\nJohn was in London, and did not know for certain how long they had the\r\npower to hold out. But he addressed his complaints to the Duke of\r\nClarence and Archbishop Nevill, who now ruled in the name of the captive\r\nking, and one Writtill, a servant of the former, was sent down to\r\nprocure a suspension of hostilities, preparatory, if possible, to a\r\nsettlement of the controversy. Terms were agreed upon by the lords in\r\nLondon which it was thought might be honourably offered to both parties.\r\nApparently it was proposed that the Earl of Oxford, as a neutral person,\r\nshould be allowed to keep the place until a final decision had been come\r\nto by a competent tribunal. But the Duke of Norfolk, after agreeing to\r\nthe suspension of hostilities, which only diminished by so many days’\r\nallowance the scanty provisions of the garrison, utterly rejected the\r\nconditions which some of his own relations in the king’s council had\r\ngiven it as their opinion that he ought not to refuse. On the other\r\nhand, Sir John Paston in London, fondly believing that the store of\r\nvictuals within the place would last a much longer period, caught at an\r\neager hope of obtaining a message from the king which would compel\r\nNorfolk to withdraw his forces, and in this idle expectation he was\r\nfoolish enough to urge Writtill to get the truce prolonged a few days\r\nfurther. Shortly afterwards he received a letter from his mother which\r\nought to have opened his eyes. Victuals, she informed him, were failing\r\nin the garrison; his brother and the little band within stood in great\r\ndanger; Daubeney and Berney, two of their captains, were dead, and\r\nseveral others were wounded; the walls were severely battered, and the\r\nsupply of gunpowder and arrows would very soon be exhausted. Since\r\nWrittill’s attempt at negotiation the Duke of Norfolk had been more\r\ndetermined than ever to win the place, and with a view to a grand\r\nassault, whenever the truce should expire, he had sent for all his\r\ntenants to be there on Holy Rood day, the 14th September. If Sir John\r\nPaston had it in his power to relieve the garrison, let him do it at\r\nonce. If not, let him obtain letters from the Duke of Clarence or the\r\nlords in London addressed to the Duke of Norfolk, to allow them to quit\r\nthe place with their lives and goods.[253-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 253-1: Nos. 722-6.]\r\n\r\nSir John Paston still would not believe that the case was desperate. He\r\nhad repeatedly declared that his desire to preserve the stronghold was\r\nexceeded only by his anxiety for the lives of his brother and those\r\nwithin. But what evidence was there to justify his mother’s\r\napprehensions? Daubeney and Berney had been alive the Saturday before,\r\nand since that day no one could have got leave to pass outside. Truce\r\nhad been prolonged till Monday following, and he expected it to be\r\nrenewed for another week. He had heard far worse tidings before than his\r\nmother told him now. As for means of relief to the besieged, the Duke of\r\nClarence and Archbishop Nevill were no longer in London, but he was\r\nexpecting an answer from the king in Yorkshire, which ought to arrive by\r\nWednesday at farthest, and his mother might rest assured there could not\r\npossibly be any fear of victuals or gunpowder running short. When all\r\nelse failed, a rescue he would certainly procure, if all the lands he\r\nheld in England and all the friends he had would enable him to obtain\r\nit. But this was the very last remedy that could be thought of. It would\r\nnot agree with the attempt to get the king or lords to interfere. It\r\nwould besides cost fully a thousand crowns, and how to raise the money\r\nhe was not sure. How much could his mother herself raise by mortgage,\r\nand what friends could she obtain to give their aid?[253-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 253-2: No. 725.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Caister surrenders.] Unluckily, while Sir John Paston was\r\ndevising means how, after another week or fortnight’s truce, effectual\r\nrelief might at last be conveyed to the besieged, they were reduced to\r\nsuch extremities as to be compelled to capitulate. Owing to the\r\nrepresentations that had been made in their behalf by Cardinal Bourchier\r\nand the Duke of Clarence, Norfolk allowed them to pass out in freedom,\r\nwith bag and baggage, horses and harness, leaving only behind them their\r\nguns, crossbows and ‘quarrels.’[254-1] Thus, after some weeks’ suspense\r\nand the loss of one valuable soldier (Margaret Paston was misinformed\r\nabout Berney being dead as well as Daubeney), the great castle in which\r\nFastolf intended the Pastons to reside and to found a college, and which\r\nhe was anxious that no great lord should occupy, fell into the hands of\r\nthe most powerful nobleman of Eastern England.[254-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 254-1: Square pyramids of iron which were shot out of\r\n    crossbows. The word is of French origin and was originally\r\n    _quarreaux_.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 254-2: Nos. 730, 731.]\r\n\r\nSir John Paston had now lost the fairest gem of his inheritance--or, as\r\nhe and his contemporaries called it, of his ‘livelode.’[254-3] Hence it\r\nwas become all the more important that he should see to the remainder.\r\nJust before the surrender of Caister, in answer to his appeal to see\r\nwhat money she could raise, his mother by a great effort obtained for\r\nhim £10 on sureties, but it was all spent immediately in paying the\r\ndischarged garrison and some other matters. Ways and means must be found\r\nto obtain money, for even his mother’s rents did not come in as they\r\nought to have done, and she expected to be reduced to borrowing, or\r\nbreaking up her household. On consideration, he determined to part with\r\nthe manor of East Beckham, and to ascertain what was likely to be\r\nrealised by selling a quantity of wood at Sporle. The sale of East\r\nBeckham--with all Paston’s lands both in East and West Beckham, Bodham,\r\nSherringham, Beeston-near-the-Sea, Runton, Shipden, Felbrigg, Aylmerton,\r\nSustead and Gresham, places which lie a few miles to the west and south\r\nof Cromer--was at length completed for the sum of 100 marks.[254-4]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 254-3: The modern confusion of this word with\r\n    _livelihood_--a word which properly means a lively condition--is\r\n    one of the things that would be unpardonable did not usage pardon\r\n    everything in language.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 254-4: Nos. 733, 737, 738.]\r\n\r\nIt was unfortunate for Sir John Paston’s interests that at such a time\r\nas this he happened to have a misunderstanding with his most faithful\r\nbailiff and general manager of his property, Richard Calle. The\r\ntitle-deeds of Beckham were in Calle’s hands, but he at once gave up,\r\nwhen required, both these and every one of the documents in his\r\npossession relating to Paston’s lands, and made a clear account of\r\neverything to John Paston the younger.[255-1] The coolness had arisen\r\nsome months before the siege; the cause was a very old, old story.\r\nRichard Calle had presumed to fall in love with Sir John Paston’s sister\r\nMargery. [Sidenote: Richard Calle and Margery Paston.] Margery Paston\r\nhad not disdained to return his affection. She at once fell into\r\ndisgrace with the whole family. Her eldest brother, Sir John, was in\r\nLondon when he heard of it, and it was insinuated to him that the matter\r\nwas quite well known to his brother John and met with his approval. John\r\nthe younger hastened to disavow the imputation. A little diplomacy had\r\nbeen used by Calle, who got a friend to inquire of him whether the\r\nengagement was a settled thing, intimating that if it were not he knew\r\nof a good marriage for the lady. But young John saw through the\r\nartifice, and gave the mediator an answer designed to set the question\r\nat rest for ever. ‘I answered him,’ writes young John himself to his\r\nbrother, ‘that an my father (whom God assoil) were alive, and had\r\nconsented thereto, and my mother and ye both, he should never have my\r\ngoodwill for to make my sister to sell candle and mustard in\r\nFramlingham.’ If such a prospect did not disgust Margery herself, it was\r\nclear she must have a very strong will of her own.[255-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 255-1: No. 737.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 255-2: No. 710.]\r\n\r\nThe anger of her relations was painful to bear in the extreme. For some\r\ntime Margery found it difficult to avow that she had fairly plighted her\r\ntroth to one who was deemed such an unequal match. For what was plighted\r\ntroth in the eye of God but matrimony itself? Even the Church\r\nacknowledged it as no less binding. Once that was avowed, the question\r\nwas at an end, and no human hands could untie the knot. To interfere\r\nwith it was deadly sin. Hence Richard Calle implored the woman of his\r\nlove to emancipate both herself and him from an intolerable position by\r\none act of boldness. ‘I suppose, an ye tell them sadly the truth, they\r\nwould not damn their souls for us.’[255-3] But it required much courage\r\nto take the step which when taken must be decisive. The avowal was at\r\nlast made, and though the family would fain have suppressed it or got\r\nthe poor girl to deny what she said, her lover appealed to the Bishop of\r\nNorwich to inquire into the matter, and free the point from any\r\nambiguity. The bishop could not refuse. He sent for Margery Paston and\r\nfor Richard Calle, and examined them both apart. He told the former that\r\nhe was informed she loved one of whom her friends did not approve,\r\nreminded her of the great disadvantage and shame she would incur if she\r\nwere not guided by their advice, and said he must inquire into the words\r\nthat had passed between her and her lover, whether they amounted to\r\nmatrimony or not. On this she told him what she had said to Calle, and\r\nadded that if those words did not make it sure she would make it surer\r\nbefore she left the bishop’s presence, for she thought herself in\r\nconscience bound to Calle, whatever the words were. Then Calle himself\r\nwas examined, and his statements agreed with hers as to the nature of\r\nthe pledges given and the time and place when it was done. The bishop\r\nthen said that in case other impediments were found he would delay\r\ngiving sentence till the Wednesday or Thursday after Michaelmas.[256-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 255-3: No. 713.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 256-1: No. 721.]\r\n\r\nWhen Margery Paston returned from her examination her mother’s door was\r\nshut against her, and the bishop was forced to find a lodging for her\r\nuntil the day that he was to give sentence. Before that day came\r\noccurred the loss of Caister. The fortunes of the Paston family were\r\ndiminished, and Sir John began to feel that he at least could ill afford\r\nto lose the services of one who had been such a faithful and attached\r\ndependant. In writing to his mother he expressed a wish merely that the\r\nmarriage might be put off till Christmas. Calle, meanwhile, unmarried,\r\nwas staying at Blackborough Nunnery near Lynn, where his bride had found\r\na temporary asylum. He was still willing to give his services to Sir\r\nJohn Paston, and promised not to offer them to any other unless Sir John\r\ndeclined them. They appear to have been accepted, for we find Calle one\r\nor two years later still in the service of the family. But he never\r\nseems to have been recognised as one of its members.[256-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 256-2: Nos. 721, 736, 737.]\r\n\r\nThe siege of Caister was one of those strong and high-handed\r\nacts which could only have been possible when there was really no\r\nsovereign authority in the land to repress and punish violence. Acts of\r\nvery much the same character had been seen before--the reader will not\r\nhave forgotten the forcible ejection of John Paston’s wife from Gresham.\r\nBut they had been due more especially to the weak and incompetent rule\r\nof Henry VI., and not even then do we hear of a place being taken from\r\none of the king’s subjects after a five weeks’ siege by a rival\r\nclaimant. It was evident that the rebellion of Robin of Redesdale had\r\ndestroyed King Edward’s power. The king had been actually made a\r\nprisoner, and the ascendency of the Woodvilles had been abolished. The\r\nDuchess of Bedford, wife of the late Earl of Rivers, had even during the\r\ncommotions been accused of witchcraft.[257-1] The Earl of Warwick\r\nenjoyed his revenge in the disorganisation of the whole kingdom. He had\r\nnow made it almost impossible for Edward to recover his authority\r\nwithout getting rid of him; nor did many months pass away before he\r\nstirred up another rebellion in Lincolnshire.[257-2] When that movement\r\nfailed, he and Clarence escaped abroad; but it was not many months\r\nbefore they reappeared in England and drove out the king. [Sidenote:\r\nWarwick the Kingmaker. A.D. 1470.] Henry VI. was proclaimed anew, and\r\nfor the space of a short half-year Warwick the Kingmaker governed in the\r\nname of that sovereign in whose deposition ten years before he had been\r\none of the principal agents.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 257-1: _Rolls of Parl._ vi. 232.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 257-2: _See_ Nos. 742, 743.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Appeal of two widows.] We have but a word or two to say as to\r\nmatters affecting the family history of the Pastons during this brief\r\ninterval. At the siege of Caister two men of the Duke of Norfolk’s were\r\nkilled by the fire of the garrison. The duke’s council, not satisfied\r\nwith having turned the Pastons out, now prompted the widows of these two\r\nmen to sue an ‘appeal’[257-3] against John Paston and those who acted\r\nwith him. A true bill was also found against them for felony at the\r\nNorwich session of June 1470, in which Sir John Paston was included as\r\nan accessory; but the indictment was held to be void by some of Paston’s\r\nfriends on the ground that two of the jury would not agree to it. This\r\nobjection I presume must have been held sufficient to quash the\r\nproceedings in this form, of which we hear no more.[258-1] The ‘appeal,’\r\nhowever, remained to be disposed of, as we shall see by and by.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 257-3: An appeal of murder was a criminal prosecution\r\n    instituted by the nearest relation of the murdered person, and a\r\n    pardon from the king could not be pleaded in bar of this process.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 258-1: Nos. 740, 746, 747.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Compromise touching Fastolf’s will.] With respect to the\r\ntitle claimed by Sir John Paston in Caister and the performance of\r\nFastolf’s will, a compromise was arranged with Bishop Waynflete, who was\r\nnow recognised as sole executor. It was agreed that as the whole of\r\nFastolf’s lands in Essex, Surrey, Norfolk, and Suffolk had been much\r\nwasted by the disputes between the executors, the manors should be\r\ndivided between Sir John Paston and the bishop, the former promising to\r\nsurrender the title-deeds of all except the manor of Caister. The\r\nproject of a college in that place was given up, and a foundation of\r\nseven priests and seven poor scholars in Magdalen College, Oxford, was\r\nagreed to in its place.[258-2] Soon afterwards the Duke of Norfolk\r\nexecuted a release to the bishop of the manor of Caister and all the\r\nlands conveyed to him by Yelverton and Howes as executors of Sir John\r\nFastolf, acknowledging that the bargain made with them was contrary to\r\nFastolf’s will, and receiving from the bishop the sum of 500 marks for\r\nthe reconveyance. The duke accordingly sent notice to his servants and\r\ntenants to depart out of the manor as soon as they could conveniently\r\nremove such goods and furniture as he and they had placed in it.[258-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 258-2: Nos. 750, 755, 767.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 258-3: Nos. 763, 764.]\r\n\r\nThus by the mediation of Bishop Waynflete the long-standing disputes\r\nwere nearly settled during the period of Henry VI.’s brief restoration.\r\nBut, probably in consequence of the disturbed state of the country and\r\nthe return of Edward IV., the duke’s orders for the evacuation of\r\nCaister were not immediately obeyed, and, as we shall see hereafter, the\r\nplace remained in Norfolk’s possession for the space of three whole\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Elizabeth Poynings remarries.] About this time, or rather,\r\nperhaps, two years later, Sir John Paston’s aunt, Elizabeth Poynings,\r\nterminated her widowhood by marrying Sir George Browne of Betchworth\r\nCastle in Surrey. We have already seen how she was dispossessed of her\r\nlands soon after her first husband’s death by the Countess of\r\nNorthumberland. They were afterwards seized by the Crown as forfeited,\r\nand granted by patent to Edmund Grey, Earl of Kent, but without any\r\ntitle having been duly found for the king. The Earl of Kent after a time\r\ngave up possession of them to the Earl of Essex, but this did not make\r\nthings pleasanter for Elizabeth Poynings; while other of her lands were\r\noccupied by Sir Robert Fenys in violation, as she alleged, of her\r\nhusband’s will.[259-1] The date of her second marriage was probably\r\nabout the end of the year 1471.[259-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 259-1: Nos. 461, 627, 692, 693.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 259-2: On the 18th November 1471, Edmund Paston speaks\r\n    of her as ‘my Aunt Ponynges.’ Before the 8th January 1472 she had\r\n    married Sir George Browne. Nos. 789, 795.]\r\n\r\nThese matters we are bound to mention as incidents in the history of the\r\nfamily. Of Elizabeth Paston, however, and her second husband we do not\r\nhear much henceforward; in the Letters after this period the domestic\r\ninterest centres chiefly round the two John Pastons, Sir John and his\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Changes and Counter-changes_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reckless government of Edward IV.] Within the space of ten\r\nbrief years Edward IV. had almost succeeded in convincing the world that\r\nhe was no more capable of governing England than the rival whom he had\r\ndeposed. Never did gambler throw away a fortune with more recklessness\r\nthan Edward threw away the advantages which it had cost him and his\r\nfriends so much hard fighting to secure. Just when he had reached the\r\nsummit of his prosperity, he alienated the men to whom it was mainly\r\ndue, and took no care to protect himself against the consequences of\r\ntheir concealed displeasure. The Earl of Warwick took him prisoner, then\r\nreleased him, then stirred up a new rebellion with impunity, and\r\nfinally, returning to England once more, surprised and drove him out,\r\nnotwithstanding the warnings of his brother-in-law, the Duke of\r\nBurgundy. Henry VI. was proclaimed anew, and the cause of the House of\r\nYork seemed to be lost for ever.\r\n\r\nIt was not so, however, in fact. Adversity quickened Edward’s energies\r\nin a manner almost miraculous, and in a few months he recovered his\r\nkingdom as suddenly as he had lost it. But it was not easy to believe,\r\neven after his most formidable enemy had been slain at Barnet, that a\r\nking who had shown himself so careless could maintain himself again upon\r\nthe throne. Besides, men who desired a steady government had rested all\r\ntheir hopes in the restoration of Henry VI., and had found the new state\r\nof matters very promising, just before Edward reappeared. The king, it\r\nmight have been hoped, would be governed this time by the Earl of\r\nWarwick, and not by Queen Margaret. [Sidenote: The Pastons favour Henry\r\nVI.] The Pastons, in particular, had very special reasons to rejoice in\r\nHenry’s restoration. They had a powerful friend in the Earl of Oxford,\r\nwhose influence with Henry and the Earl of Warwick stood very high.\r\nOwing partly, perhaps, to Oxford’s intercession, the Duke of Norfolk had\r\nbeen obliged to quit his hold of Caister, and Sir John Paston had been\r\nreinstated in possession.[260-1] The Duke and Duchess of Norfolk sued to\r\nOxford as humbly as the Pastons had been accustomed to sue to them, and\r\nthe earl, from the very first, had been as careful of the interests of\r\nthis family as if they had been his own. Even in the first days of the\r\nrevolution--probably before Edward was yet driven out--he had sent a\r\nmessenger to the Duchess of Norfolk from Colchester when John Paston was\r\nin London on a matter which concerned him alone. The family, indeed,\r\nseem at first to have built rather extravagant expectations upon the new\r\nturn of affairs, which John Paston felt it necessary to repress in\r\nwriting to his mother. ‘As for the offices that ye wrote to my brother\r\nfor and to me, they be for no poor men, but I trust we shall speed of\r\nother offices meetly for us, for my master the Earl of Oxford biddeth me\r\nask and have. I trow my brother Sir John shall have the constableship of\r\nNorwich Castle, with £20 of fee. All the lords be agreed to it.’[260-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 260-1: _See_ preliminary note to Letter No. 879.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 260-2: No. 759.]\r\n\r\nCertainly, when they remembered the loss of Caister, which they had now\r\nregained--when they recalled his inability to protect them against armed\r\naggression, and the disappointment of their expectations of redress\r\nagainst the Duke of Suffolk for the attack on the lodge at\r\nHellesdon--the Pastons had little cause to pray for the return of Edward\r\nIV. They were completely committed to the cause of Henry; and Sir John\r\nPaston and his brother fought, no doubt in the Earl of Oxford’s company,\r\nagainst King Edward at Barnet. [Sidenote: Sir John Paston and his\r\nbrother in the battle of Barnet. A.D. 1471.] Both the brothers came out\r\nof the battle alive, but John Paston was wounded with an arrow in the\r\nright arm, beneath the elbow.[261-1] His wound, however, was not of a\r\nvery serious character, and in little more than a fortnight he was able\r\nto write a letter with his own hand.[261-2] A more serious consideration\r\nwas, how far the family prospects were injured by the part they had\r\ntaken against what seemed now to be the winning side. Perhaps they might\r\nbe effectually befriended by their cousin Lomner, who seems to have\r\nadhered to Edward, and who had promised them his good offices, if\r\nrequired. But on the whole the Pastons did not look despondingly upon\r\nthe situation, and rather advised their cousin Lomner not to commit\r\nhimself too much to the other side, as times might change. ‘I beseech\r\nyou,’ writes Sir John Paston to his mother, ‘on my behalf to advise him\r\nto be well aware of his dealing or language as yet; for the world,\r\nI ensure you, is right queasy, as ye shall know within this month. The\r\npeople here feareth it sore. God hath showed Himself marvellously like\r\nHim that made all, and can undo again when Him list, and I can think\r\nthat by all likelihood He shall show Himself as marvellous again, and\r\nthat in short time.’[261-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 261-1: No. 774.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 261-2: No. 776.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 261-3: No. 774.]\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, Sir John Paston, when he wrote these words, had\r\nalready heard of the landing of Queen Margaret and her son in the west,\r\nso that another conflict was certainly impending. His brother John,\r\nrecovering from his wounds, but smarting severely in pocket from the\r\ncost of his surgery, looked forward to it with a sanguine hope that\r\nEdward would be defeated. ‘With God’s grace,’ he writes, ‘it shall not\r\nbe long ere my wrongs and other men’s shall be redressed, for the world\r\nwas never so like to be ours as it is now. Wherefore I pray you let\r\nLomner not be too busy yet.’[262-1] The issue, however, did not agree\r\nwith his expectations. [Sidenote: The battle of Tewkesbury.] Four days\r\nlater was fought the battle of Tewkesbury,[262-2] at which Margaret was\r\ndefeated, and her son, though taken alive, put to death upon the field.\r\nShortly afterwards she herself surrendered as a prisoner, while her\r\nchief captain, Somerset, was beheaded by the conqueror. The Lancastrian\r\nparty was completely crushed; and before three weeks were over, King\r\nHenry himself had ended his days--no doubt he was murdered--within the\r\nTower. Edward, instead of being driven out again, was now seated on the\r\nthrone more firmly than he had ever been before; and the Paston brothers\r\nhad to sue for the king’s pardon for the part they had taken in opposing\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 262-1: No. 776.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 262-2: In connection with this battle, we have in No.\r\n    777 lists of the principal persons killed and beheaded after the\r\n    fight, and of the knights made by King Edward upon the field. This\r\n    document has never been published before.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Caister retaken by the Duke of Norfolk.] Under these\r\ncircumstances, it was only natural that the Duke of Norfolk, who had\r\nbeen forced to relinquish his claim to Caister under the government of\r\nHenry VI., should endeavour to reassert it against one who was in the\r\neye of the law a rebel. On this occasion, however, the duke had recourse\r\nto stratagem, and one of his servants suddenly obtained possession of\r\nthe place on Sunday, the 23rd June.[262-3] It is remarkable that we have\r\nno direct reference in the letters either to this event, or to the\r\nprevious reinstatement of Sir John Paston during the restoration of\r\nHenry VI.; but a statement in the itinerary of William Worcester and Sir\r\nJohn Paston’s petition to the king in 1475[262-4] leave no doubt about\r\nthe facts. After about six months of possession the Pastons were again\r\ndriven out of Caister.[262-5]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 262-3: W. Worc. _Itin._, 368.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 262-4: No. 879.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 262-5: Although the fact of this expulsion could not be\r\n    gathered from the letters of this date, some allusion to it will\r\n    be found in Letter 778, by which it seems that a horse of John\r\n    Paston’s had been left at Caister, which the family endeavoured to\r\n    reclaim by pretending that it was his brother Edmund’s. John\r\n    Paston, however, seems to have preferred that the duke’s men\r\n    should keep the animal, in the hope that they would make other\r\n    concessions of greater value.]\r\n\r\nThe Pastons had need of friends, and offers of friendship were made to\r\nthem by Earl Rivers, formerly Lord Scales. [Sidenote: Earl Rivers offers\r\nhis friendship.] The engagement of Sir John Paston to Rivers’s\r\nkinswoman, Anne Haute,[263-1] still held; and though there was some talk\r\nof breaking it off, the earl was willing to do what lay in his power in\r\nbehalf both of Sir John and of his brother. The latter was not very\r\ngrateful for his offer, considering, apparently, that the earl’s\r\ninfluence with the king was not what it had been. ‘Lord Scales,’ he\r\nsaid, for so he continued to call him, ‘may do least with the great\r\nmaster. But he would depart over the sea as hastily as he may; and\r\nbecause he weeneth that I would go with him, as I had promised him ever,\r\nif he had kept forth his journey at that time, this is the cause that he\r\nwill be my good lord, and help to get my pardon. The king is not best\r\npleased with him, for that he desireth to depart; insomuch that the king\r\nhath said of him that whenever he hath most to do, then the Lord Scales\r\nwill soonest ask leave to depart, and weeneth that it is most because of\r\ncowardice.’[263-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 263-1: A transcript of an old pedigree with which I was\r\n    favoured by Mr. J. R. Scott during the publication of these\r\n    letters long ago, confirmed my conjecture that Anne Haute was the\r\n    daughter of William Haute, whose marriage with Joan, daughter of\r\n    Sir Richard Woodville, is referred to in the _Excerpta Historica_,\r\n    p. 249. She was, therefore, the niece of Richard, Earl Rivers, and\r\n    cousin-german to Edward IV.’s queen. It appears also that she had\r\n    a sister named Alice, who was married to Sir John Fogge of\r\n    Ashford, Treasurer of the Household to Edward IV. This Sir John\r\n    Fogge was the man whom Richard III., having previously regarded\r\n    him as a deadly enemy, sent for out of sanctuary, and took\r\n    publicly by the hand at his accession, in token that he had\r\n    forgotten all old grudges.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 263-2: No. 778.]\r\n\r\nEarl Rivers, in fact, was at this time meditating a voyage to Portugal,\r\nwhere he meant to go in an expedition against the Saracens, and he\r\nactually embarked on Christmas Eve following.[263-3] His friendship,\r\nperhaps, may have been unduly depreciated by the younger brother; for\r\nwithin twelve days John Paston actually obtained the king’s signature to\r\na warrant for his pardon. This, it is true, may have been procured\r\nwithout his mediation; but in any case the family were not in the\r\nposition of persons for whom no one would intercede. They had still so\r\nmuch influence in the world that within three months after he had been a\r\nsecond time dispossessed of Caister, Sir John made a serious effort to\r\nascertain whether the Duke of Norfolk might not be induced to let him\r\nhave it back again. [Sidenote: Sir J. Paston petitions the Duke of\r\nNorfolk to give back Caister.] This he did, as was only natural, through\r\nthe medium of his brother John, whose former services in the duke’s\r\nhousehold gave him a claim to be heard in a matter touching the personal\r\ninterests of the family. John Paston, however, wisely addressed himself,\r\non this subject, rather to the duchess than to the duke; and though he\r\nreceived but a slender amount of encouragement, it was enough, for a few\r\nmonths, just to keep his hopes alive. ‘I cannot yet,’ he writes, ‘make\r\nmy peace with my lord of Norfolk by no means, yet every man telleth me\r\nthat my lady sayeth passing well of me always notwithstanding.’ This was\r\nwritten in the beginning of the year 1472, just seven months after Sir\r\nJohn’s second expulsion from Caister. But the Pastons continued their\r\nsuit for four years more, and only recovered possession of the place on\r\nthe Duke of Norfolk’s death, as we shall see hereafter.[264-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 263-3: Nos. 793, 795.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 264-1: Nos. 781, 796, 802.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Paston Brothers_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Royal pardon to John Paston.] John Paston obtained a ‘bill of\r\npardon’ signed by the king, on Wednesday the 17th July. This, however,\r\nwas not in itself a pardon, but only a warrant to the Chancellor to give\r\nhim one under the Great Seal. The pardon with the Great Seal attached he\r\nhoped to obtain from the Chancellor on the following Friday. Meanwhile\r\nhe wrote home to his mother to let no one know of it but Lady Calthorpe,\r\nwho, for some reason not explained, seems to have been a confidante in\r\nthis particular matter.[264-2] Perhaps this was as well, for as a matter\r\nof fact the pardon was not sealed that Friday, nor for many a long week,\r\nand even for some months after. It seems to have been promised, but it\r\ndid not come. At Norwich some one called John Paston traitor and sought\r\nto pick quarrels with him; and how far he could rely upon the protection\r\nof the law was a question not free from anxiety. His brother, Sir John,\r\nurged him to take steps to have the pardon made sure without delay; but\r\nit was only passed at length upon the 7th of February following, nearly\r\nseven months after the king had signed the bill for it. His brother, Sir\r\nJohn, obtained one on the 21st December.[265-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 264-2: No. 780.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 265-1: Nos. 780, 781, 795.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The appeal of the widows.] But John Paston stood in another\r\ndanger, from which even a royal pardon could not by law protect him. The\r\n‘appeal’[265-2] of the two widows still lay against him. The blood of\r\ntheir husbands cried for vengeance on the men who had defended Caister,\r\nand especially upon the captain of the garrison. Their appeal, however,\r\nwas suspected to proceed from the instigation of others who would fain\r\nhave encouraged them to keep it up longer than they cared to do\r\nthemselves. Sir John Paston had information from some quarter which led\r\nhim to believe that they had both found husbands again, and he\r\nrecommended his brother to make inquiry, as in that case the appeals\r\nwere abated. With regard to one of them, the intelligence turned out to\r\nbe correct. A friend whom John Paston asked to go and converse with this\r\nwoman, the widow of a fuller of South Walsham, reported that she was now\r\nmarried to one Tom Steward, dwelling in the parish of St. Giles in\r\nNorwich. She confessed to him that she never sued the appeal of her own\r\naccord, ‘but that she was by subtle craft brought to the New Inn at\r\nNorwich. And there was Master Southwell; and he entreated her to be my\r\nlord’s widow[265-3] by the space of an whole year next following; and\r\nthereto he made her to be bound in an obligation. And when that year was\r\npast he desired her to be my lord’s widow another year. And then she\r\nsaid that she had liever lose that that she had done than to lose that\r\nand more; and therefore she said plainly that she would no more of that\r\nmatter; and so she took her an husband, which is the said Tom Steward.\r\nAnd she saith that it was full sore against her will that ever the\r\nmatter went so far forth, for she had never none avail thereof, but it\r\nwas sued to her great labor and loss, for she had never of my lord’s\r\ncouncil but barely her costs to London.’[265-4]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 265-2: _See_ p. 257, note 3.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 265-3: The widow of a lord’s vassal was called the\r\n    lord’s widow, and could only marry again by his leave.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 265-4: Nos. 782, 783.]\r\n\r\nThe other widow, however, had not married again as Sir John had\r\nimagined. With her the right of appeal still remained, and she was\r\ninduced to exercise it. In this she seems to have been encouraged by the\r\nDuke of Norfolk, simply for the sake of giving trouble to Sir John\r\nPaston; for though it was his brother and the men with him who were the\r\nmost direct cause of her husband’s death, the appeal was not prosecuted\r\nagainst them, but against him only. In the following January the widow\r\nwent up to London, and 100 shillings were given her to sue with. What\r\ncame of the affair then we have no further record. Sir John Paston was\r\nwarned of his danger both by his mother and by his brother; so perhaps\r\nhe found the means to induce her to forbear proceeding further. An\r\nargument that has often enough stopped the course of justice would\r\ndoubtless have been efficacious to put an end to such a purely vexatious\r\nprosecution. But it may be that the case was actually heard, and Sir\r\nJohn Paston acquitted.[266-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 266-1: Nos. 796, 797.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Great mortality.] In a social point of view the year of\r\nEdward IV.’s restoration was not one of gladness. The internal peace of\r\nthe kingdom was secured by the two sharp battles of Barnet and\r\nTewkesbury, and by the execution of the Bastard Falconbridge after his\r\nattempt on London, but the land was visited with pestilence and the\r\nmortality was severe. Hosts of pilgrims travelled through the country,\r\neager to escape the prevailing infection or to return thanks for their\r\nrecovery from illness. The king and queen went on pilgrimage to\r\nCanterbury; and never, it was said, had there been so many pilgrims at a\r\ntime.[266-2] ‘It is the most universal death that ever I wist in\r\nEngland,’ says Sir John Paston; ‘for by my trouth I cannot hear by\r\npilgrims that pass the country that any borough town in England is free\r\nfrom that sickness. God cease it when it pleaseth Him! Wherefore, for\r\nGod’s sake let my mother take heed to my young brethren, that they be in\r\nnone place where that sickness is reigning, nor that they disport not\r\nwith none other young people which resorteth where any sickness is; and\r\nif there be any of that sickness dead or infect in Norwich, for God’s\r\nsake let her send them to some friends of hers into the country, and do\r\nye the same by mine advice. Let my mother rather remove her household\r\ninto the country.’[267-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 266-2: No. 782.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 267-1: No. 781.]\r\n\r\nThe plague continued on till the beginning of winter. Margaret Paston\r\ndoes not seem to have removed into the country, but in writing to her\r\nson John in the beginning of November she notes the progress of the\r\nenemy. ‘Your cousin Berney of Witchingham is passed to God, whom God\r\nassoyle! Veyl’s wife, and London’s wife, and Picard the baker of\r\nTombland, be gone also. All this household and this parish is as ye left\r\nit, blessed be God! We live in fear, but we wot not whither to flee for\r\nto be better than we be here.’[267-2] In the same letter Margaret Paston\r\nspeaks of other troubles. [Sidenote: Money matters.] She had been\r\nobliged to borrow money for her son Sir John, and it was redemanded. The\r\nfortunes of the family were at a low ebb, and she knew not what to do\r\nwithout selling her woods--a thing which would seriously impair the\r\nvalue of Sir John’s succession to her estates, as there were so many\r\nwood sales then in Norfolk that no man was likely to give much more than\r\nwithin a hundred marks of their real value. She therefore urged Sir John\r\nin his own interest to consider what he could do to meet the difficulty.\r\nAlready she had done much for him, and was not a little ashamed that it\r\nwas known she had not reserved the means of paying the debts she had\r\nincurred for him. Sir John, however, returned for answer that he was\r\nutterly unable to make any shift for the money, and Margaret saw nothing\r\nfor it but the humiliation of selling wood or land, or even furniture,\r\nto meet the emergency. ‘It is a death to me to think upon it,’ she\r\nwrote. She felt strongly that her son had not the art of managing with\r\neconomy--that he spent double the money on his affairs that his father\r\nhad done in matters of the same character, and, what grieved her even\r\nmore, that duties which filial pride ought to have piously discharged\r\nlong ago had been neglected owing to his extravagance. ‘At the reverence\r\nof God,’ she writes to his younger brother John, ‘advise him yet to\r\nbeware of his expenses and guiding, that it be no shame to us all. It is\r\na shame and a thing that is much spoken of in this country that your\r\nfather’s gravestone is not made. [Sidenote: John Paston’s gravestone.]\r\nFor God’s love, let it be remembered and purveyed in haste. There hath\r\nbeen much more spent in waste than should have made that.’ Apparently\r\ndirect remonstrances had failed to tell upon Sir John otherwise than to\r\nmake him peevish and crusty. She therefore wrote to his younger brother\r\ninstead. ‘Me thinketh by your brother that he is weary to write to me,\r\nand therefore I will not accumber him with writing to him. Ye may tell\r\nhim as I write to you.’[268-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 267-2: No. 787.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 268-1: Nos. 787, 791. In justice to Sir John Paston it\r\n    should be mentioned that he had been making inquiries two months\r\n    before as to the dimensions of the space over his father’s grave\r\n    at Bromholm available for a monument.--_See_ No. 782. More than\r\n    five years, however, had elapsed since his father’s death, and\r\n    even two years after this the tomb was not attended to, as we find\r\n    by repeated comments on the subject.--_See_ Nos. 843 and 878. This\r\n    last letter has been accidentally misplaced, and is really of the\r\n    year 1472, as will be shown hereafter.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sir John Paston and Anne Haute.] Thriftless, extravagant, and\r\nirresolute, Sir John Paston was not the man to succeed, either in money\r\nmatters or in anything else. No wonder, then, that his engagement with\r\nAnne Haute became unsatisfactory, apparently to both parties alike. The\r\nmanner in which he speaks of it at this time is indeed ambiguous; but\r\nthere can be no doubt that in the end both parties desired to be\r\nreleased, and were for a long time only restrained by the cost of a\r\ndispensation, which was necessary to dissolve even such a contract as\r\ntheirs. It would not have been surprising, indeed, if on the restoration\r\nof Edward IV. Lord Rivers and the queen’s relations had shown themselves\r\nunfavourable to a match between their kinswoman and one who had fought\r\nagainst the king at Barnet. But whether this was the case or not we have\r\nno positive evidence to show. Only we know that in the course of this\r\nyear the issue of the matter was regarded as uncertain. In September Sir\r\nJohn Paston writes that he had almost spoken with Mrs. Anne Haute, but\r\nhad not done so. ‘Nevertheless,’ he says, ‘this next term I hope to take\r\none way with her or other. She is agreed to speak with me and she hopeth\r\nto do me ease, as she saith.’[268-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 268-2: No. 781.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1471, Oct.] Six weeks later, in the end of October, the\r\nstate of matters is reported, not by Sir John Paston but by his brother.\r\n‘As for Mrs. A. Haulte, the matter is moved by divers of the queen’s\r\ncouncil, and of fear by R. Haulte; but he would it should be first of\r\nour motion, and we would it should come of them first--our matter should\r\nbe the better.’[269-1] [Sidenote: A.D. 1472, Feb.] In February following\r\nSir John was admitted to another interview with the lady, but was unable\r\nto bring the matter to a decisive issue. ‘I have spoken,’ he says, ‘with\r\nMrs. Anne Haulte at a pretty leisure, and, blessed be God, we be as far\r\nforth as we were tofore, and so I hope we shall continue. And I promised\r\nher that at the next leisure that I could find thereto, that I would\r\ncome again and see her, which will take a leisure, as I deem now. Since\r\nthis observance is overdone, I purpose not to tempt God no more\r\nso.’[269-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 269-1: No. 784.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 269-2: No. 798.]\r\n\r\nA year later, in April 1473, he says that if he had six days more\r\nleisure, he ‘would have hoped to have been delivered of Mrs. Anne\r\nHaulte. Her friends, the queen, and Atcliff,’ he writes, ‘agreed to\r\ncommon and conclude with me, if I can find the mean to discharge her\r\nconscience, which I trust to God to do.’[269-3] But the discharge of her\r\nconscience required an application to the Court of Rome, and this\r\ninvolved a very unsentimental question of fees. ‘I have answer again\r\nfrom Rome,’ he writes in November following, ‘that there is the well of\r\ngrace and salve sufficient for such a sore, and that I may be dispensed\r\nwith; nevertheless my proctor there asketh a thousand ducats, as he\r\ndeemeth. But Master Lacy, another Rome runner here, which knoweth my\r\nsaid proctor there, as he saith, as well as Bernard knew his shield,\r\nsayeth that he meaneth but an hundred ducats, or two hundred ducats at\r\nthe most; wherefore after this cometh more. He wrote to me also _quod\r\nPapa hoc facit hodiernis diebus multociens_ (that the Pope does this\r\nnowadays very frequently).’[269-4]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 269-3: No. 831.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 269-4: No. 842.]\r\n\r\nHere we lose for a while nearly all further trace of the matter. Nothing\r\nmore seems to have been done in it for a long time; for about fourteen\r\nmonths later we find Sir John Paston’s mother still wishing he were\r\n‘delivered of Mrs. Anne Haulte,’[270-1] and this is all we hear about it\r\nuntil after an interval of two years more, when, in February 1477, Sir\r\nJohn reports that the matter between him and Mrs. Anne Haulte had been\r\n‘sore broken’ to Cardinal Bourchier, the Lord Chamberlain (Hastings),\r\nand himself, and that he was ‘in good hope.’[270-2] Finally, in August\r\nfollowing, he expects that it ‘shall, with God’s grace, this term be at\r\na perfect end.’[270-3] After this we hear nothing more of it. The\r\npre-contract between Sir John and Anne Haulte seems therefore to have\r\nbeen at last annulled; and what is more remarkable, after it had been\r\nso, he was reported to be so influential at Court that another marriage\r\nwas offered him ‘right nigh of the Queen’s blood.’[270-4] His mother,\r\nwho writes to him on the subject in May 1478, had not been informed who\r\nthe lady was, and neither can we tell the reader. We only know for\r\ncertain that such a marriage never took effect.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 270-1: No. 863. Some months before the time when he\r\n    himself expressed that hope of being delivered from his\r\n    engagement, I meet with a passage of rather doubtful meaning in a\r\n    letter to Sir John Paston from his brother. There is a lady in the\r\n    case, but the lady is not named. John Paston has delivered to her\r\n    a ring which he had much difficulty in inducing her to take. But\r\n    he promises that Sir John shall be her true knight, and she in\r\n    return promises to be more at his commandment than at any knight’s\r\n    in England, ‘my lord’ excepted. ‘And that ye shall well\r\n    understand’ (so John Paston reports the message) ‘if ye have aught\r\n    to do wherein she may be an helper; for there was never knight did\r\n    so much cost on her as ye have done.’ (No. 817.) Is this anonymous\r\n    lady Anne Haulte once more? Was the ring an engagement ring\r\n    returned? And did they thus break off relations with each other,\r\n    retaining mutual esteem? Let us hope this is the explanation,\r\n    which indeed I should even think probable, but that the lady must\r\n    have been at this time residing in the county of Norfolk, and I\r\n    have no notice of Anne Haulte having been there at any time.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 270-2: No. 900.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 270-3: No. 916.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 270-4: No. 933.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John Paston’s love affairs.] John Paston, too, had his love\r\naffairs as well as his brother, but was more fortunate in not being\r\nbound helplessly to one lady for a long series of years. In the summer\r\nof 1471, he seems to have been endeavouring to win the hand of a certain\r\nLady Elizabeth Bourchier; but here he did not prosper, for she was\r\nmarried a few months later to Lord Thomas Howard--the nobleman who more\r\nthan forty years after was created Duke of Norfolk by King Henry VIII.\r\nfor his victory over the Scots at Flodden.[270-5] As to his further\r\nproceedings in search of a wife, we shall have occasion to speak of them\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 270-5: Nos. 781, 800.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1472.] Property was at all times a matter of more\r\nimportance than love to that selfish generation; it was plainly,\r\navowedly regarded by every one as the principal point in marrying.\r\n[Sidenote: The Dukes of Clarence and Gloucester.] In the royal family at\r\nthis very time, the design of Richard, Duke of Gloucester, to marry the\r\nwidow of Edward, Prince of Wales, awoke the jealousy of his brother\r\nClarence. For the lady was a younger sister of Clarence’s own wife, and\r\nco-heir to her father, Warwick the Kingmaker; and since the death of\r\nthat great earl at Barnet, Clarence seems to have pounced on the whole\r\nof his immense domains without the slightest regard even to the rights\r\nof his widow, who, indeed, was now in disgrace, and was living in\r\nsanctuary at Beaulieu. The idea of being compelled to share the property\r\nwith his brother was a thing that had never occurred to him, and he\r\ncould not endure the thought. He endeavoured to prevent the proposed\r\nmarriage by concealing the lady in London.[271-1] Disputes arose between\r\nthe two brothers in consequence, and though they went to Sheen together\r\nto pardon, it was truly suspected to be ‘not all in charity.’ The king\r\nendeavoured to act as mediator, and entreated Clarence to show a fair\r\namount of consideration to his brother; but his efforts met with very\r\nlittle success. ‘As it is said,’ writes Sir John Paston, ‘he answereth\r\nthat he may well have my lady his sister-in-law, but they shall part no\r\nlivelode,’--the elder sister was to have all the inheritance, and the\r\nyounger sister nothing! No wonder the writer adds, ‘So what will fall\r\ncan I not say.’[271-2] What did fall, however, we know partly from the\r\nPaston Letters and partly from other sources. The Duke of Gloucester\r\nmarried the lady in spite of his brother’s threats. The dispute about\r\nthe property raged violently more than two years, and almost defied the\r\nking’s efforts to keep his two brothers in subjection. In November 1473\r\nwe find it ‘said for certain that the Duke of Clarence maketh him big in\r\nthat he can, showing as he would but deal with the Duke of Gloucester;\r\nbut the king intendeth, in eschewing all inconvenients, to be as big as\r\nthey both, and to be a styffeler atween them. And some men think that\r\nunder this there should be some other thing intended, and some treason\r\nconspired.’ Sir John Paston again did not know what to make of it, and\r\nwas driven to reiterate his former remark, ‘So what shall fall can I not\r\nsay.’[272-1] He only hoped the two brothers would yet be brought into\r\nagreement by the king’s award.[272-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 271-1: _Contin. Chron. of Croyland_, 557.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 271-2: No. 798.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 272-1: No. 841.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 272-2: No. 842.]\r\n\r\nThis hope was ultimately realised. Clarence at last consented with an\r\nill will to let his sister-in-law have a share in her father’s lands;\r\nand an arrangement was made by a special Act of Parliament for the\r\ndivision of the property.[272-3] To satisfy the rapacity of the royal\r\nbrothers, the claims of the Countess of Warwick were deliberately set\r\naside, and the Act expressly treated her as if she had been a dead\r\nwoman. So the matter was finally settled in May 1474. Yet possibly the\r\nCountess’s claims had some influence in hastening this settlement; for\r\nabout a twelvemonth before she had been removed from her sanctuary at\r\nBeaulieu[272-4] and conveyed northwards by Sir James Tyrell. This, it\r\nappears, was not done avowedly by the king’s command; nevertheless\r\nrumour said that it was by his assent, and also that it was contrary to\r\nthe will of Clarence.[272-5]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 272-3: _Rolls of Parl._ vi. 100.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 272-4: ‘Beweley Seyntwarye’ in Fenn; but the reading is\r\n    ‘_Beverley_ sanctuary’ in the right-hand version. Which is\r\n    correct?]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 272-5: No. 834.]\r\n\r\nEven so in the Paston family love affairs give place at this time to\r\nquestions about property, in which their interests were very seriously\r\nat stake. Not only was there the great question between Sir John and the\r\nDuke of Norfolk about Caister, but there was also a minor question about\r\nthe manor of Saxthorpe, the particulars of which are not very clear. On\r\nthe 12th July 1471, Sir John Paston made a release of Saxthorpe and\r\nTitchwell and some other portions of the Fastolf estates, to David\r\nHusband and William Gyfford;[272-6] but this was probably only in the\r\nnature of a trust, for it appears that he did not intend to give up his\r\ninterest in the property. [Sidenote: A.D. 1472, Jan.] In January\r\nfollowing, however, William Gurney entered into Saxthorpe and\r\nendeavoured to hold a court there for the lord of the manor. [Sidenote:\r\nJohn Paston interrupts the Manor Court at Saxthorpe.] But John Paston\r\nhearing of what was doing, went thither accompanied by one man only to\r\nprotect his brother’s interest, and charged the tenants, in the presence\r\nof Gurney himself and a number of his friends, to proceed no further.\r\nThe protest was effective so far as to produce a momentary pause. But\r\nwhen it was seen that he had only one man with him, the proceedings were\r\nresumed; on which John Paston sat down by the steward and blotted his\r\nbook with his finger as he wrote, and then called the tenants to witness\r\nthat he had effectually interrupted the court in his brother’s\r\nright.[273-1] Gurney, however, did not give up the game, but warned\r\nanother court to be kept on Holy Rood day (May 3rd, the Invention of the\r\nHoly Cross), when he would have collected the half-year’s rents from the\r\ntenants. The court was held, but before it was half over John Paston\r\nappeared again and persuaded him to stay proceedings once more, and to\r\nforbear gathering money until he and Sir John Paston should confer\r\ntogether in London. It seems to have required some tact and courtesy to\r\nget him to consent to this arrangement; for Henry Heydon, the son of the\r\nold ally of Sir Thomas Tuddenham, had raised a number of men-at-arms to\r\ngive Gurney any assistance that might have been necessary, but the\r\ngentle demeanour of John Paston left him no pretext for calling in such\r\naid.[273-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 272-6: No. 779.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 273-1: No. 796.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 273-2: No. 801.]\r\n\r\nThe real claimant of the manor against Sir John Paston was Waynflete,\r\nBishop of Winchester, of whom, almost immediately after this, Henry\r\nHeydon bought both Saxthorpe and Titchwell. Sir John Paston, apparently,\r\nhad been caught napping as usual, and knew nothing of the transaction.\r\nHis mother wrote to him in dismay on the 5th June. Young Heydon had\r\nalready taken possession. ‘We beat the bushes,’ said Margaret Paston,\r\n‘and have the loss and the disworship, and other men have the birds. My\r\nlord hath false counsel and simple that adviseth him thereto. And, as it\r\nis told me, Guton is like to go the same way in haste. And as for\r\nHellesdon and Drayton, I trow it is there it shall be. What shall fall\r\nof the remnant God knoweth,--I trow as evil or worse.’[273-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 273-3: No. 803.]\r\n\r\nJohn Paston in like manner writes on the same day that Heydon was sure\r\nof Saxthorpe, and Lady Boleyn of Guton.[274-1] Sir John Paston was\r\nletting the family property slip out of his fingers, while on the other\r\nhand he was running into debt, and in his straitened circumstances he\r\nwas considering what he could sell. His mother had threatened if he\r\nparted with any of his lands to disinherit him of double the\r\namount;[274-2] so he was looking out for a purchaser of his wood at\r\nSporle, which he was proposing to cut down.[274-3] But by far the most\r\nserious matter of all was Caister; ‘if we lose that,’ said Margaret\r\nPaston, ‘we lose the fairest flower of our garland.’ To her, too, it\r\nwould be peculiarly annoying, for she expected to have little comfort in\r\nher own family mansion at Mautby, if the Duke of Norfolk had possession\r\nof Caister only three miles off.[274-4] [Sidenote: Sir John Paston seeks\r\nto get Caister restored to him.] On this subject, however, Sir John\r\nPaston does not appear to have been remiss. It was the first thing that\r\noccupied his thoughts after he had secured his pardon. In the beginning\r\nof the year he had been with Archbishop Nevill, who, though he had been\r\nin disgrace and committed to the Tower just after the battle of Barnet,\r\nseems at this time again to have had some influence in the world, at his\r\nresidence called the Moor. By the archbishop’s means apparently he had\r\nreceived his pardon, and had spent a merrier Christmas in consequence;\r\nand he wrote to his mother that if he could have got any assurance of\r\nhaving Caister restored to him, he would have come away at once.[274-5]\r\nBut it was not long before the archbishop again got into trouble. He was\r\nonce more conducted to the Tower, and two days afterwards at midnight he\r\nwas put on board a ship and conveyed out to sea.[274-6] Nothing more\r\ntherefore was to be hoped for from the archbishop’s friendship; but Sir\r\nJohn Paston did not cease to use what means lay in his power. His\r\nbrother made incessant applications on his behalf to the Duchess of\r\nNorfolk, and to the duke’s council at Framlingham. To be reinstated Sir\r\nJohn was willing to make the duke a present of £40, an offer which the\r\ncouncil acknowledged was ‘more than reasonable.’ If the matter were\r\ntheir own, they gave John Paston to understand, they could easily come\r\nto an understanding with him, but my lord was intractable. The duchess\r\nherself declined to interfere in the matter until my lord and the\r\ncouncil were agreed, and the latter said that when they had mooted it to\r\nthe duke ‘he gave them such an answer that none of them all would tell\r\nit.’ They suggested, however, that the duke might be swayed by more\r\ninfluential opinions, and that if Sir John could get my Lord Chamberlain\r\nHastings, or some other nobleman of mark, to speak to the duke in his\r\nfavour, there was great probability that he would attain his\r\nobject.[275-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 274-1: No. 804.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 274-2: No. 802.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 274-3: Nos. 798, 804, 819, 820.--No. 819 is a little out\r\n    of its place, the exact date of the letter being the 9th May.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 274-4: No. 803.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 274-5: No. 795.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 274-6: No. 800.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 275-1: No. 809.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Duchess of Norfolk.] A favourable opportunity, however,\r\npresented itself shortly afterwards for urging a petition for justice on\r\nthe duke himself. After ten years or more of married life the Duchess of\r\nNorfolk was at length with child. Duke and duchess received everywhere\r\ncongratulations from their friends and dependants. Among the rest Sir\r\nJohn Paston offered his to my lady herself, in a vein of banter that\r\nseems slightly to have offended her, though not perhaps so much by its\r\ngrossness, which was excessive, as by the undue familiarity exhibited in\r\nsuch a tone of address.[275-2] The Duke of Norfolk was going to be with\r\nhis wife on the occasion of her lying-in, and John Paston, as an old\r\nservant of the family, went to give his attendance at Framlingham. It\r\nwas resolved that the utmost should be made of the opportunity. John\r\nPaston drew up a petition in behalf of his brother to present to the\r\nduke, while Sir John Paston himself, then in London, obtained letters\r\nfrom the king to both the duke and duchess, and also to their council.\r\nThe king seems to have been particularly interested in the case, and\r\nassured Sir John that if his letters were ineffectual justice should be\r\ndone in the matter without delay. The letters were despatched by a\r\nspecial messenger, ‘a man of worship’ in high favour with the king\r\nhimself. With such powerful influence engaged on his behalf, most\r\nprobably Sir John did not care to ask for letters from Lord Hastings,\r\nwhich his brother was even then expecting. But he suggested, if my\r\nlady’s lying-in should be at Norwich instead of Framlingham, that his\r\nmother might obtain admittance to her chamber, and that her persuasions\r\nwould be of considerable use.[276-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 275-2: Nos. 812, 813.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 276-1: Nos. 813, 814, 815, 817, 824. _See_ also No. 878,\r\n    which by a strange inadvertence has been put in the year 1475\r\n    instead of 1472. The preliminary note is correct except as to the\r\n    year.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Birth of a daughter.] The duchess was confined at\r\nFramlingham, and gave birth to a daughter, who received the name of\r\nAnne. Waynflete, Bishop of Winchester, came down to christen the child,\r\nand he, too, took an opportunity during his brief stay to say a word to\r\nmy lady about Caister and the claim of Sir John Paston to restitution.\r\nBut exhortations, royal letters, and all were thrown away upon the Duke\r\nof Norfolk. My lady promised secretly to another person to favour Sir\r\nJohn’s suit, but the fact of her giving such a promise was not to be\r\ncommunicated to any one else. John Paston was made as uncomfortable as\r\npossible by the manner in which his representations were received. ‘I\r\nlet you plainly wit,’ he wrote to his brother, ‘I am not the man I was,\r\nfor I was never so rough in my master’s conceit as I am now, and that he\r\ntold me himself before Richard Southwell, Tymperley, Sir W. Brandon, and\r\ntwenty more; so that they that lowered now laugh upon me.’[276-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 276-2: No. 823.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sir John Paston seeks to enter Parliament.] But although all\r\narts were unsuccessful to bend the will of the Duke of Norfolk on this\r\nsubject, Sir John Paston seems to have enjoyed the favour and approval\r\nof the duchess in offering himself as a candidate for the borough of\r\nMaldon in the Parliament of 1472. His friend James Arblaster wrote a\r\nletter to the bailiff of Maldon suggesting the great advantage it would\r\nbe to the town to have for one of their two burgesses ‘such a man of\r\nworship and of wit as were towards my said lady,’ and advising all her\r\ntenants to vote for Sir John Paston, who not only had this great\r\nqualification, but also possessed the additional advantage of being in\r\nhigh favour with my Lord Chamberlain Hastings.[276-3] There was,\r\nhowever, some uncertainty as to the result, and his brother John\r\nsuggested in writing to him that if he missed being elected for Maldon\r\nhe might be for some other place. There were a dozen towns in England\r\nthat ought to return members to Parliament which had chosen none, and by\r\nthe influence of my Lord Chamberlain he might get returned for one of\r\nthem.[277-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 276-3: No. 808.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 277-1: No. 809.]\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, I find that Sir John Paston was not returned for\r\nMaldon to the Parliament of 1472; and whether he sat for any other\r\nborough I am not certain, though there is an expression in the\r\ncorrespondence a little later that might lead one to suppose so.[277-2]\r\nBut that he went up to London we know by a letter dated on the 4th\r\nNovember;[277-3] and though he went to Calais, and even visited the\r\ncourt of the Duke and Duchess of Burgundy at Ghent early in the\r\nfollowing year, when Parliament was no longer sitting, he had returned\r\nto London long before it had ended its second session in April\r\n1473.[277-4] It is also clear that he took a strong interest in its\r\nproceedings; but this was only natural. That Parliament was summoned\r\navowedly to provide for the safety of the kingdom. Although the Earl of\r\nWarwick was now dead, and Margaret of Anjou a prisoner at\r\nWallingford,[277-5] and the line of Henry VI. extinct, [Sidenote: Fear\r\nof Invasion.] it was still anticipated that the Earl of Oxford and\r\nothers, supported by the power of France, would make a descent upon the\r\ncoast. Commissions of array were issued at various times for defence\r\nagainst apprehended invasion.[277-6] Information was therefore laid\r\nbefore Parliament of the danger in which the kingdom stood from a\r\nconfederacy of the king’s ‘ancient and mortal enemies environing the\r\nsame,’ and a message was sent to the Commons to the effect that the king\r\nintended to equip an expedition in resistance of their malice.[277-7]\r\nThe result was that, in November 1472, the Commons agreed to a levy of\r\n13,000 archers, and voted a tenth for their support, which was to be\r\nlevied before Candlemas following.[278-1] An income and property tax was\r\nnot a permanent institution of our ancestors, but when it came it\r\npressed heavily; so that a demand of two shillings in the pound was not\r\nat all unprecedented. A higher tax had been imposed four years before,\r\nand also in 1453 by the Parliament of Reading. Still, a sudden demand of\r\ntwo shillings in the pound, to be levied within the next four months,\r\nwas an uncomfortable thing to meet; and owing either to its unpopularity\r\nor the difficulty of arranging the machinery for its collection, it was\r\nnot put in force within the time appointed. [Sidenote: A.D. 1473.] But\r\nin the following spring, when the Parliament had begun its second\r\nsession, collectors were named throughout the country, and it was\r\nnotified that some further demands were to be made upon the national\r\npocket. On the 26th March, John Paston writes that his cousin John\r\nBlennerhasset had been appointed collector in Norfolk, and asks his\r\nbrother Sir John in London to get him excused from serving in ‘that\r\nthankless office,’ as he had not a foot of ground in the county. At the\r\nsame time the writer expresses the sentiments of himself and his\r\nneighbours in language quite sufficiently emphatic: ‘I pray God send you\r\nthe Holy Ghost among you in the Parliament House, and rather the Devil,\r\nwe say, than ye should grant any more taxes.’[278-2] Unfortunately,\r\nbefore the Parliament ended its sittings, it granted a whole fifteenth\r\nand tenth additional.[278-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 277-2: His name does not appear in any of the original\r\n    returns preserved in the Record Office; but they are certainly\r\n    very imperfect, and some of them are not very legible. The two\r\n    burgesses returned for Maldon were William Pestell and William\r\n    Albon. I find, however, that William Paston, probably Sir John’s\r\n    uncle, was returned for Newcastle-under-Lyne.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 277-3: No. 812.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 277-4: He could scarcely have returned from Calais in\r\n    time for the opening of that session on the 8th February, as he\r\n    was at Calais on the 3rd, and says nothing about coming home at\r\n    that date.--No. 826.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 277-5: No. 795.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 277-6: Patent, 7th March, 12 Edw.

Margaret\r\nPaston had several times expressed her discontent with the thriftless\r\nextravagance of her eldest son, and even the second, John, did not stand\r\ncontinually in her good graces. A third brother, Edmund, was now just\r\ncoming out in life, and as a preparation for it he too had to endure\r\ncontinual reproofs and remonstrances from his mother. Besides these,\r\nthere were at home three other sons and one daughter, of whom we shall\r\nspeak hereafter. The young generation apparently was a little too much\r\nfor the lone widow; and, finding her elder sons not very satisfactory\r\nadvisers, she did what lone women are very apt to do under such\r\ncircumstances--took counsel in most of the affairs of this life of a\r\nconfidential priest. In fact, she was a good and pious woman, to whom in\r\nher advancing years this world appeared more and more in its true\r\ncharacter as a mere preparation for the next. She had now withdrawn from\r\ncity life at Norwich, and was dwelling on her own family estate at\r\nMautby. Bodily infirmities, perhaps--though we hear nothing explicitly\r\nsaid of them--made it somewhat less easy for her to move about; and she\r\ndesired to obtain a licence from the Bishop of Norwich to have the\r\nsacrament in her own chapel.[279-1] She was also thinking, we know, of\r\ngetting her fourth son Walter educated for the priesthood; and she\r\nwished her own spiritual adviser, Sir James Gloys,[279-2] to conduct him\r\nto Oxford, and see him put in the right way to pursue his studies\r\ncreditably. She hoped, she said, to have more joy of him than of his\r\nelder brothers; and though she desired him to be a priest, she wished\r\nhim not to take any orders that should be binding until he had reached\r\nthe age of four-and-twenty. ‘I will love him better,’ she said, ‘to be a\r\ngood secular man than a lewd priest.’[279-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 279-1: No. 821. She repeats the request more than two\r\n    years later, and desires that if it cannot be obtained of the\r\n    Bishop of Norwich, John Paston should endeavour to get it of the\r\n    Archbishop of Canterbury, ‘for that,’ she says, ‘is the most sure\r\n    for all places.’--No. 866.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 279-2: We ought, perhaps, to have explained before that\r\n    the prefix ‘Sir’ before a priest’s name, as in Sir James Gloys and\r\n    Sir Thomas Howes, was commonly used as equivalent to ‘Reverend,’\r\n    though strictly speaking it was applied to one who had taken no\r\n    higher degree than bachelor.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 279-3: No. 825. Even so Erasmus says of More (Epp.\r\n    lib. x. 30, col. 536). ‘Maluit maritus esse castus quam sacerdos\r\n    impurus.’ The sentiment evidently was a very common one.]\r\n\r\n  [[(Epp. lib. x. 30, col. 536).\r\n  _text unchanged: expected final comma_]]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sir James Gloys.] But the influence of this spiritual adviser\r\nover their mother was by no means agreeable to the two eldest sons. John\r\nPaston speaks of him in a letter to his brother as ‘the proud, peevish,\r\nand ill-disposed priest to us all,’ and complains grievously of his\r\ninterference in family affairs. ‘Many quarrels,’ he writes, ‘are picked\r\nto get my brother Edmund and me out of her house. We go not to bed\r\nunchidden lightly; all that we do is ill done, and all that Sir James\r\nand Pecock doth is well done. Sir James and I be twain. We fell out\r\nbefore my mother with “Thou proud priest,” and “Thou proud squire,” my\r\nmother taking his part; so I have almost beshut the bolt as for my\r\nmother’s house; yet summer shall be done or I get me any master.’[280-1]\r\nJohn Paston, in fact, was obliged to put up with it for some months\r\nlonger, and though he afterwards reports that Sir James was always\r\n‘chopping at him,’ and seeking to irritate him in his mother’s presence,\r\nhe had found out that it was not altogether the best policy to rail at\r\nhim in return. So he learned to smile a little at the most severe\r\nspeeches, and remark quietly, ‘It is good hearing of these old\r\ntales.’[280-2] This mode of meeting the attack, if it did not soften Sir\r\nJames’s bitterness, may have made Margaret Paston less willing to take\r\nhis part against her son. At all events we hear no more of these\r\nencounters. Sir James Gloys, however, died about twelve months\r\nlater.[280-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 280-1: No. 805.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 280-2: No. 810.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 280-3: No. 842.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Taxation, Private Affairs, and the French War_\r\n\r\nThe impatience of taxation expressed by John Paston and others may\r\nperhaps be interpreted as showing that little was generally known, or at\r\nall events believed, of any such serious danger to the kingdom from\r\noutward enemies as had been represented to Parliament. Nevertheless, in\r\nMarch 1473, John Paston speaks of ‘a few Frenchmen whirling on the\r\ncoasts,’ for fear of whom the fishermen did not venture to leave port\r\nwithout safe conducts.[280-4] [Sidenote: Hogan’s prophecies.] A\r\npolitical prophet named Hogan also foretold that some attempt would\r\nshortly be made to invade the kingdom or to create trouble within it.\r\nBut the French ships soon returned home, and Hogan’s words were not\r\ngreatly esteemed, though he was arrested and sent up to London for\r\nuttering them. He had, in fact, prophesied similar things before. Yet\r\nthere was an impression in some quarters that he might be right on this\r\noccasion. He was committed to the Tower, and he desired leave to speak\r\nto the king, but Edward declined to give him any occasion for boasting\r\nthat his warnings had been listened to. Ere long, however, his story was\r\nto some extent justified. News came that on Saturday, the 10th April,\r\nthe Earl of Oxford had been at Dieppe with twelve ships, about to sail\r\nfor Scotland. A man was examined in London, who gave information that\r\nlarge sums of money had been sent him from England, and that a hundred\r\ngentlemen in Norfolk and Suffolk had agreed to assist him if he should\r\nattempt a landing. On the 28th May he actually did land at St. Osith’s,\r\nin Essex, but hearing that the Earl of Essex with the Lords Dynham and\r\nDurasse were coming to oppose him, he returned to his ships and sailed\r\naway. His attempt, however, saved Hogan his head, and gained him greater\r\nesteem as a prophet; for he had foretold ‘that this trouble should begin\r\nin May, and that the king should northwards, and that the Scots should\r\nmake us work and him battle.’ People began everywhere to buy armour,\r\nexpecting they knew not what.[281-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 280-4: No. 828.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 281-1: Nos. 829, 830, 831, 833, 834.]\r\n\r\nSir John Paston, for his part, during his visit to the Burgundian court\r\nin the end of January,[281-2] had already ordered a complete suit of\r\narmour for himself, together with some horse armour, of Martin Rondelle,\r\nthe armourer of the Bastard of Burgundy.[281-3] But the demand for\r\narmour increased as the year went on. [Sidenote: The Earl of Oxford at\r\nSt. Michael’s Mount.] The Earl of Oxford again suddenly appeared, this\r\ntime on the coast of Cornwall, and took possession of St. Michael’s\r\nMount on the last day of September. He was besieged there by Sir Henry\r\nBodrugan, but the place was so strong that, if properly victualled,\r\ntwenty men could keep it against the world. The earl’s men, however,\r\nparleyed with Sir Henry, who by some gross negligence allowed victuals\r\nto be conveyed into the Mount. The command of the besieging force was\r\ntaken from him by the king and given to Richard Fortescue, sheriff of\r\nCornwall.[281-4] At the same time the quarrel between the Dukes of\r\nClarence and Gloucester contributed to make people uneasy. The world, as\r\nSir John Paston phrased it, seemed ‘queasy.’ Every man about the king\r\nsent for his ‘harness.’ The king himself sent for the Great Seal, which\r\nwas conveyed to him by Dr. Morton, Master of the Rolls. Some expected\r\nthat he would make a new Chancellor, some that he would keep the Seal in\r\nhis own hands as he had done during former commotions.[282-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 281-2: He was at Ghent on Thursday, 28th January.--No.\r\n    826.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 281-3: No. 838.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 281-4: Warkworth’s _Chronicle_, 26-7.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 282-1: No. 841.]\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Oxford was fast shut up in the Mount. But during November he\r\nmade a sally, took a gentleman prisoner, and dragged him within. Shortly\r\nafterwards, attempting to give more trouble to the besiegers, he was\r\nwounded in the face with an arrow.[282-2] But his gallant defence seems\r\nto have awakened sympathy in the West Country; for on the 10th December\r\nthe king found it necessary to issue a proclamation against bearing arms\r\nin Devonshire.[282-3] However, after keeping possession of the place for\r\nfour months and a half, he felt himself compelled to surrender, not by\r\nlack of victuals, but for want of reliance on his own men, to whom the\r\nking had offered pardons and rewards for deserting him. The earl himself\r\nwas constrained to sue for pardon of his own life, and yielded himself a\r\nprisoner on the 15th February 1474.[282-4]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 282-2: No. 843.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 282-3: _Close Roll_, 13 Edw. IV., m. 8.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 282-4: No. 846. Warkworth, 27.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Projected royal expedition against France.] Meanwhile people\r\nwere looking forward to a royal expedition against France. It was for\r\nthis the 13,000 archers were to be raised, and it was agreed in\r\nParliament that if the expedition did not take place before Michaelmas\r\n1474, the money collected for the purpose should be repaid. As the time\r\ndrew near, however, it was found impossible to carry out the project\r\nquite so soon. The tenth voted in November 1472 had been assessed by the\r\ncommissioners before February 1473 over all the kingdom, except five\r\nnorthern shires and one or two separate hundreds and wapentakes. But the\r\ntotal amount of the assessment had only produced £31,410: 14: 1½, a sum\r\nwhich to the modern reader will appear inconceivably small as the\r\nproceeds of a ten per cent. income and property tax for nearly the whole\r\nof England. It was in fact not sufficient for the purpose intended; even\r\nsuch a tax, strange to say, could not maintain 13,000 archers; and the\r\nCommons, as we have already said, voted one-tenth and one-fifteenth\r\nadditional. This impost, however, was not immediately levied. On the\r\n26th March 1473 a truce was made at Brussels between England and\r\nBurgundy on the one side, and France on the other, till the 1st April\r\n1474.[283-1] After it expired Edward announced to his Parliament that he\r\nintended as soon as possible to invade France in person; but as it was\r\nnot likely that he could do so before Michaelmas following, the time at\r\nwhich the money was to be repaid to the taxpayers, in case of the\r\nexpedition not taking place, was prolonged to St. John Baptist’s Day\r\n(24th June) in 1476.[283-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 283-1: No. 832. It is curious that we have no notice of\r\n    this truce in Rymer.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 283-2: _Rolls of Parl._ vi. 113-14.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1474.] [Sidenote: Effects of severe taxation.] The\r\ntaxation pinched every one severely. ‘The king goeth so near us in this\r\ncountry,’ wrote Margaret Paston, ‘both to poor and rich, that I wot not\r\nhow we shall live but if the world amend.’ The two taxes came so close\r\nupon each other that they had to be paid at one and the same\r\ntime.[283-3] And to those who, like Sir John Paston, were in debt and\r\ntrying to raise money for other purposes, the hardship was extreme. So\r\nmany were selling corn and cattle that very little was to be realised in\r\nthat way. Wheat was but 2s. 4d. a comb, and malt and oats but tenpence.\r\nDuring the year 1473 Sir John had applied in vain to his mother for a\r\nloan of £100 to redeem the manor of Sporle, which he had been obliged to\r\nmortgage. He had already been driven to sell a portion of the wood, and\r\nhad thoughts of giving a seven years’ lease of the manor to a neighbour\r\nof the name of Cocket, on receiving six years’ rent in ready\r\nmoney.[283-4] But in 1474, having received £100 from the executors of\r\nLyhart, Bishop of Norwich, in satisfaction of some old claim, his mother\r\nconsented to lend another sum of like amount, which would enable him,\r\nwith a very little further help from some other quarter, to meet the\r\ndemands of Townsend the mortgagee.[283-5] In the end, however, a sum of\r\n£142: 13: 4 was advanced by his uncle William, and some other moneys by\r\nMargaret Paston, partly on the security of her own plate, and partly on\r\nthat of Sir John Paston’s lands in the hundred of Flegg.[283-6]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 283-3: No. 871. ‘William Pecock shall send you a bill\r\n    what he hath paid for you for two tasks (_taxes_) at this time.’\r\n    Margaret Paston to Sir John, 23rd May 1475.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 283-4: Nos. 828, 831, 842, 865.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 283-5: No. 856.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 283-6: No. 865.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arrangement with Bishop Waynflete.] About the same time Sir\r\nJohn came to an understanding with Bishop Waynflete about the lands of\r\nSir John Fastolf; [Sidenote: The college at Caister abandoned.] and the\r\nbishop having obtained a dispensation from the Pope enabling him to\r\napply the endowments of Fastolf’s intended college at Caister to the\r\nsupport of Magdalen College, Oxford, a division was made of the Norfolk\r\nlands between him and Paston. Sir John was allowed to enjoy Caister and\r\nthe lands in Flegg, if he could recover them from the Duke of Norfolk,\r\nwith the manor of Hellesdon, Tolthorpe, and certain tenements in Norwich\r\nand Earlham; but he gave up Drayton to the bishop. And so terminated one\r\nlong-standing controversy.[284-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 284-1: Nos. 834, 859.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anne Paston engaged to William Yelverton.] An event in the\r\nfamily now claims our notice, although the allusions to it are but\r\nslight, and the manner in which it is referred to is quite in keeping\r\nwith that strange absence of domestic feeling which is so painfully\r\ncharacteristic of the times. Anne Paston, Sir John’s sister, had come to\r\na marriageable age; and her mother disposed of her hand to William\r\nYelverton, a grandson of the judge, although she had an offer from one\r\nof the family of Bedingfield.[284-2] The engagement had lasted at least\r\na year and a half, when Sir John Paston in London heard news that she\r\nhad been exceedingly unwell; on which he quietly remarks that he had\r\nimagined she was already married. It seems scarcely possible to\r\nattribute this ignorance to any unusual detention of letters between\r\nNorwich and London; so that we are almost driven to conclude that his\r\nsister’s marriage was an event of which Sir John did not expect to\r\nreceive any very special intimation. The news even of her sickness,\r\nI suspect from the manner in which he refers to it, was conveyed to him\r\nnot by letters from home, but by Yelverton, her intended husband, who\r\nhad come up to London. Nor must it be supposed that Yelverton himself\r\nwas deeply concerned about her state of health; for it was certainly not\r\nwith a lover’s anxiety that he communicated the intelligence to Sir\r\nJohn. In fact the marriage, so far from being a thing already\r\naccomplished, as Sir John supposed, was a matter that still remained\r\nuncertain. ‘As for Yelverton,’ writes Sir John himself, ‘he said but\r\nlate that he would have her if she had her money, and else not;\r\nwherefore me thinketh that they be not very sure.’ Still the old song of\r\n‘Property, property,’ like Tennyson’s ‘Northern Farmer.’ And how very\r\nquietly this cold-hearted brother takes the news that the marriage which\r\nhe thought already accomplished might very likely never take place at\r\nall! ‘But among all other things,’ he adds, ‘I pray you beware that the\r\nold love of Pampyng renew not.’ What, another sister ready to marry a\r\nservant of the family? If she could not have Yelverton, at least let her\r\nbe preserved from that at all hazards.[285-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 284-2: No. 804.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 285-1: Nos. 842, 843.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Married to him.] Such was the state of matters in November\r\n1473. And it seems by the course of events that Pampyng was not allowed\r\nto follow the example of Richard Calle. Anne Paston remained unmarried\r\nfor about three and a half years longer, and the family, despairing of\r\nYelverton, sought to match her somewhere else;[285-2] but between March\r\nand June of the year 1477, the marriage with Yelverton actually took\r\nplace.[285-3] Of the married life of this couple we have in the Paston\r\nLetters no notices whatever; but one incident that occurred in it we\r\nlearn from another source. Yelverton brought his bride home to his own\r\nhouse at Caister St. Edmund’s, three miles from Norwich. Some time after\r\ntheir marriage this house was burned down by the carelessness of a\r\nservant girl while they were away at the marriage of a daughter of Sir\r\nWilliam Calthorpe. The year of the occurrence is not stated, but must,\r\nI think, have been 1480, for it happened on a Tuesday night, the 18th of\r\nJanuary, the eve of St. Wolstan’s Day.[285-4] Now the 18th of January\r\ndid not fall on a Tuesday during their married life in any earlier year,\r\nand it did not so fall again till 1485, when William Worcester, in whose\r\nitinerary the event is recorded, was certainly dead.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 285-2: No. 885.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 285-3: Margaret Paston speaks of ‘my son Yelverton’ in\r\n    June 1477.--No. 913. But Anne appears to have been unmarried at\r\n    least as late as the 8th March 1477.--_See_ No. 901.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 285-4: ‘Memorandum, quod manerium. . . .

Worc. _Itin._, 269.]\r\n\r\n  [[per candelam igne consumptum.’\r\n  _close quote missing_]]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John Paston’s marriage prospects.] John Paston, too, was\r\nseriously thinking of taking a wife; and, that he might not be\r\ndisappointed in an object of so much importance, he had two strings to\r\nhis bow. We must not, however, do him the injustice to suppose that he\r\nhad absolutely no preference at all for one lady over another; for he\r\nwrites his full mind upon the subject to his brother Sir John in London,\r\nwhom he commissions to negotiate for him. If Harry Eberton the draper’s\r\nwife were disposed to ‘deal’ with him, such was the ‘fantasy’ he had for\r\nMistress Elizabeth Eberton, her daughter, that he requests his brother\r\nnot to conclude ‘in the other place,’ even though old Eberton should not\r\nbe disposed to give her so much dowry as he might have with the second\r\nlady. Nevertheless Sir John is also requested to ascertain ‘how the\r\nmatter at the Black Friars doth; and that ye will see and speak with the\r\nthing yourself, and with her father and mother or ye depart; and that it\r\nlike you to desire John Lee’s wife to send me a bill in all haste\r\npossible, how far forth the matter is, and whether it shall be necessary\r\nfor me to come up to London hastily or not, or else to cast all at the\r\ncock.’[286-1] The reader, we trust, is fully impressed with the\r\nbusinesslike character of this diplomacy, and he ought certainly not to\r\nbe less so with the appropriateness of the language employed. ‘If Mrs.\r\nEberton will _deal_ with me,’ and ‘Speak with _the thing_ yourself.’ How\r\ntruly does it indicate the fact that young ladies in those days were\r\nnothing but mere chattels!\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 286-1: No. 850.]\r\n\r\nIt happened, however, that neither the ‘thing’ at the Black Friars, nor\r\nthe lady for whom he had the somewhat greater ‘fantasy,’ was to be\r\nattained. Apparently the former was the daughter of one Stockton, and\r\nwas married about four months later to a man of the name of Skerne. She\r\nherself confidentially told another woman just before her marriage that\r\nMaster Paston had once come to the place where she was with twenty men,\r\nand endeavoured to take her away. As for Eberton’s daughter, the matter\r\nquietly dropped, but before it was quite broken off John Paston had\r\nengaged his brother’s services as before in a new matter with the Lady\r\nWalgrave. Sir John Paston executed his commission here too with the\r\nutmost zeal to promote his brother’s suit; but he received little\r\ncomfort from the lady, and could not prevail upon her to accept John\r\nPaston’s ring. Indeed she told him plainly she meant to abide by an\r\nanswer she had already given to John Paston himself, and desired Sir\r\nJohn no more to intercede for him. Sir John, however, had secured\r\npossession of a small article belonging to her, a muskball, and told her\r\nhe meant to send it to his brother, without creating in her any feeling\r\nof displeasure. Thus the lover was still left with some slight gleam of\r\nhope--if, at least, he cared to indulge it further; but it does not\r\nappear by the correspondence that he thought any more either of Lady\r\nWalgrave or of Elizabeth Eberton.[287-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 287-1: Nos. 858, 860.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John Paston’s pilgrimage to Compostella.] We have omitted to\r\nnotice an incident characteristic of the times, which ought not to pass\r\naltogether unrecorded. The year before these love passages took place,\r\nJohn Paston took a voyage to Spain on pilgrimage to the shrine of St.\r\nJames of Compostella. He sailed, or was about to sail, from Yarmouth\r\nearly in July, for the letters only allude to the voyage when he was on\r\nthe eve of departure, and he declared his purpose of coming home again\r\nby Calais, where his brother expected to see him within a month after he\r\nleft.[287-2] It does not appear what prompted this pious expedition,\r\nunless it was the prevalence of sickness and epidemics in England.\r\nMargaret Paston’s cousin, John Berney of Reedham, died in the beginning\r\nof that year;[287-3] and the letter, which first speaks of John Paston’s\r\nintended pilgrimage, records also the deaths of the Earl of Wiltshire\r\nand the Lord Sudley, and mentions a false rumour of the death of Sir\r\nWilliam Stanley.[287-4] The death of Sir James Gloys, Margaret Paston’s\r\npriest, occurred about four months later; and the same letter in which\r\nthat event is mentioned says also that Lady Bourchier (I presume John\r\nPaston’s old flame, though she was now the wife of Thomas Howard) had\r\nbeen nearly dead, but had recovered.[287-5] It is evident that the year\r\nwas one of great mortality, though not perhaps quite so great as that of\r\ntwo years before.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 287-2: Nos. 833, 836.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 287-3: No. 825.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 287-4: No. 833.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 287-5: No. 842.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Illness of Sir John Paston.] During the autumn of the year\r\nfollowing, Sir John Paston had an illness, which probably attacked him\r\nin London, and induced him to remove into Norfolk. After a little\r\ncareful nursing by his mother, his appetite returned, and he felt\r\nhimself so much stronger that he went back again to London to see to his\r\npecuniary affairs, which required careful nursing as much as he had done\r\nhimself. His brother Edmund, too, had been ill in London about the same\r\ntime, but he found him ‘well amended’; which was, perhaps, not\r\naltogether the case with himself, for during the winter he had a return\r\nof fever, with pain in the eyes and in one of his legs, particularly in\r\nthe heel.[288-1] Sir John, however, was not the man to make much of a\r\nslight indisposition. About Christmas or the New Year he had gone over\r\nto Calais; and while his mother was solicitous about the state of his\r\nhealth, he said nothing about it, but wrote that he was going into\r\nFlanders, and hoped to get a sight of the siege of Neuss.[288-2] On\r\nreceipt of his mother’s letter, however, he wrote back that he was\r\nperfectly well again, except that the parts affected were still\r\ntender.[288-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 288-1: Nos. 856, 862, 863, 865.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 288-2: No. 861.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 288-3: No. 865.]\r\n\r\n  [[Footnote 288-3: _missing number “3” added_]]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Siege of Neuss.] This siege of Neuss--a town on the Rhine\r\nnear Düsseldorf--was an undertaking of Charles the Bold, Duke of\r\nBurgundy, on which the eyes of the whole world were riveted, and\r\nespecially of Englishmen. A body of 3000 English took part in the\r\noperations.[288-4] But the work was arduous, and in the end proved\r\nineffectual. Not only was the attempt a failure, but it caused the\r\nbreakdown of other projects besides. The duke had hoped to be master of\r\nthe place before the truce with France expired in June 1475, and\r\nafterwards to join with Edward in an invasion of that country, in which\r\nhe was bound by treaty to co-operate. But month after month slipped\r\naway, and the Burgundian forces were still detained before Neuss, so\r\nthat he was unable strictly to fulfil his engagement. His cunning enemy\r\nLouis saw his advantage in the circumstance, and contrived to cool\r\nEdward’s ardour for the war by arts peculiarly his own. He received with\r\nthe greatest possible politeness the herald sent by Edward to defy him;\r\nasked him to a private conference; told him he was sure his master had\r\nnot entered on the expedition on his own account, but only to satisfy\r\nthe clamour of his own people and the Duke of Burgundy. He remarked that\r\nthe duke, who had not even then returned from Neuss, had lost the flower\r\nof his army in the siege, and had occasioned the waste of so much time\r\nthat the summer was already far spent. He then suggested that the herald\r\nmight lay these and other considerations before his master to induce him\r\nto listen to a peace; and he dismissed him with a handsome\r\npresent.[289-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 288-4: Comines, Book iv. ch. i.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 289-1: Comines, Book iv. ch. v.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Edward IV. and Louis XI.] The herald did what was expected of\r\nhim, and the result told in two ways. Edward’s vanity was flattered and\r\nhis cupidity was excited. The King of France, it seemed, stood in awe of\r\nhim, and did not wish to fight. He was willing to pay handsomely for\r\npeace. How much easier, after all, to accept a large yearly tribute in\r\nrecognition of his sovereignty over France than to vindicate it by\r\nconquering the country! Arguments, too, were not wanting in the shape of\r\nprivate pensions offered by Louis to the Lords of the English Council.\r\nNot, of course, that English noblemen regarded these gratuities as\r\nbribes--Lord Hastings, at least, stood upon his dignity and refused to\r\ngive a receipt for money which was but a free-will offering on the one\r\npart, and involved no obligation on the other.[289-2] Still the money\r\nwas very acceptable, and there was no doubt a great deal of weight in\r\nthe arguments addressed by Louis to the herald. Indeed, any one worthy\r\nto be called a statesman knew quite well that the idea of conquering\r\nFrance was altogether chimerical.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 289-2: _Ibid._ ch. viii.]\r\n\r\nThis was true; but it would scarcely have been pleasant news to the\r\nnation at large, which had been taxed and taxed again for the sake of\r\nthat same chimerical idea, to have been informed of what was going on\r\nin the king’s council-chamber. For not only had a tenth been voted\r\none year, and a tenth and fifteenth another, but the wealthy had been\r\nsolicited to make still further contributions in a form till now unheard\r\nof--contributions called ‘benevolences,’ [Sidenote: Benevolences.]\r\nbecause they were supposed, by a cruel irony, to be offered and given\r\nwith good will.[290-1] For the nation was quite sufficiently\r\naware--there were many then alive who could testify it from past\r\nexperience--that it was a difficult and costly business to make any\r\nconquests in France; and everybody had been pricked and goaded to\r\nfurnish what he could towards the equipment of the expedition out of\r\nhis own resources.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 290-1: _Contin. Chron. Croyl._ p. 558. The king, as is\r\n    well known, went about soliciting contributions personally. During\r\n    the year 1474, as appears by his Privy Seal dates, he visited\r\n    Leicester, Nottingham, Derby, Coventry, Guildford, Farnham,\r\n    Kenilworth, Worcester, Gloucester, Bristol, and Cirencester, in\r\n    different excursions, returning to London in November; after which\r\n    he again set out, going this time into Suffolk. He was at Bury on\r\n    the 5th and 7th December, and at West Thorpe, on the northern\r\n    confines of the county, on the 8th. From this it appears (though\r\n    the Privy Seal dates do not show it) that he must have gone on to\r\n    Norwich. After which we find him at Coventry on the 26th, so that\r\n    he probably spent his Christmas there. That he visited Norwich\r\n    about that time, and solicited benevolences there, is evident from\r\n    Letter 863.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peace with France.] Sir John Paston’s brothers, John[290-2]\r\nand Edmund,[290-3] and probably another named Clement, of whom we have\r\nvery little notice in the correspondence, went over in the king’s great\r\narmy to Calais. Sir John himself had been in Calais for some time\r\nbefore, and his mother commended his younger brothers to his care,\r\nurging him to give them the benefit of his advice and experience for\r\ntheir safety, as some of them were but young soldiers.[290-4] Margaret\r\nPaston need not have been so anxious if she had been in the secrets of\r\nthe Cabinet. No blood was drawn in that campaign. The army had crossed\r\nthe sea in the end of June, and peace was already made in the end of\r\nAugust. Nominally, indeed, it was but a seven years’ truce, but it was\r\nintended to be lasting. For a payment of 75,000 crowns in ready money,\r\na pension of 50,000 crowns a year, and an undertaking that the Dauphin\r\nshould hereafter marry Edward’s eldest daughter, and that Louis should\r\ngive her a dowry of 60,000 livres a year, the king consented to withdraw\r\nhis forces and trouble France no longer with his claims.[290-5]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 290-2: Nos. 868, 876.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 290-3: No. 873.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 290-4: No. 871.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 290-5: Rymer, xii. 14-21.]\r\n\r\nWas it a triumph or a humiliation? an easy victory of Edward over Louis,\r\nor of Louis over Edward? The thing might be, and was, looked at from\r\ndifferent points of view. The English considered that they had forced\r\nFrance to pay tribute; the French king chuckled at having made Edward\r\nhis pensioner. Louis, doubtless, had the best of the bargain, for he had\r\nmanaged to sow division between England and Burgundy, and to ward off a\r\nvery serious danger from France. But common-place, dull-witted\r\nEnglishmen saw the thing in a different light, and Sir John Paston gave\r\nthanks to God when he reported that the king’s ‘voyage’ was finished and\r\nhis host returned to Calais.[291-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 291-1: No. 875.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sir John Paston ill again.] Sir John, however, was the worse\r\nof his abode in Calais air.[291-2] He had felt himself strong and\r\nvigorous when upon the march, but on the return of the army to Calais he\r\nwas again taken ill in eight days. We may, perhaps, suspect that it was\r\nanother outbreak of his old disease, and that he never allowed himself\r\nsufficient rest to make a perfect recovery. But it may be that from the\r\ngeneral neglect of proper sanitary arrangements, pestilence was still\r\nrife both in Calais and in England. Six weeks later his brother John at\r\nNorwich was also much troubled with sickness.[291-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 291-2: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 291-3: No. 877.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir John Paston and Caister_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: William Paston.] When Sir John Paston returned to England,\r\nthe first thing that he had to consider was how to meet a debt to his\r\nuncle William which was due at Michaelmas.[291-4] William Paston is a\r\nmember of the family of whom we totally lose sight for many years after\r\nthe very beginning of Edward’s reign; but his pecuniary relations with\r\nhis nephew about this time cause him again to be spoken of and to take\r\npart in the correspondence.[291-5] He was, doubtless, a rich man,\r\nalthough we find him pledging some of his plate to Elizabeth Clere of\r\nOrmesby.[291-6] He was one of the trustees of Elizabeth, Countess of\r\nOxford, the mother of the banished earl.[291-7] He had married, probably\r\nsince the decease of his brother the eldest John Paston, the Lady Anne\r\nBeaufort, third daughter of Edmund, Duke of Somerset, a lady of a\r\nwealthy family; and he occupied the great mansion called Warwick’s Inn,\r\nnear Newgate, which had been the town-house of the mighty Kingmaker. His\r\nmother, Agnes Paston, lived there along with him.[292-1] Of his family\r\nwe may mention here that the first child he had by the Lady Anne was a\r\ndaughter named Mary, born, as we know from an old register, on St.\r\nWolstan’s Day, the 19th January 1470. The second, more than four years\r\nlater, was also a daughter, and having been born on Tuesday the 19th\r\nJuly 1474, the eve of St. Margaret’s Day,[292-2] was christened Margaret\r\nnext day at St. Sepulchre’s Church, having for her godfather the Duke of\r\nBuckingham, and for her godmothers, Margaret, Duchess of\r\nSomerset,[292-3] and Anne, Countess of Beaumont.[292-4] Neither of these\r\ntwo daughters, however, survived him. The second, Margaret, died four\r\nmonths after her birth, at a time when her father was absent from\r\nLondon, and was buried before he came home.[292-5] In the end, the lands\r\nof William Paston descended to two other daughters, for he had no sons.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 291-4: No. 875.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 291-5: Nos. 854, 855, 856.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 291-6: No. 851.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 291-7: No. 845.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 292-1: No. 856.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 292-2: Our authority is very particular as to the time,\r\n    and gives not only the day but the hour: ‘Inter horam post nonam\r\n    et horam ante horam secundam, viz., fere dimidiam horam ante horam\r\n    secundam, luna curren., et erat clara dies.’]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 292-3: Mother of the Lady Margaret Beaufort, Countess of\r\n    Richmond, who was the mother of King Henry VII.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 292-4: So according to Sandford’s Genealogy of the\r\n    Paston family in Mr. Worship’s communication to the _Norfolk\r\n    Archæology_. But who was Anne, Countess of Beaumont? I find no\r\n    Earl Beaumont in the peerage, but there was a William, Viscount\r\n    Beaumont, who succeeded his father in that title in 1459.\r\n    According to Dugdale, he had two wives, the first of whom was\r\n    named Elizabeth, and the second Joan. His mother, who may have\r\n    been living at this time, was also named Elizabeth, but I can find\r\n    no Anne.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 292-5: No. 857.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Money matters.] At this time Sir John had only borrowed of\r\nhis uncle £4, a sum not quite so inconsiderable in those days as it is\r\nnow, but still a mere trifle for a man of landed property, being perhaps\r\nequivalent to £50 or £60 at the present day. He repaid the money about\r\nNovember 1474, and his uncle, being perhaps agreeably surprised,\r\ninquired how he was going to redeem a mortgage of 400 marks held by one\r\nTownsend on the manor of Sporle. William Paston was already aware that\r\nSir John had received a windfall of £100 from the executors of Walter\r\nLyhart, Bishop of Norwich, who died two years before, and that some one\r\nelse had offered to advance another £100, which left only 100 marks\r\nstill to be raised. He was afraid his nephew had been compelled to offer\r\nan exorbitant rate of interest for the loan. Sir John, however, being\r\npressed with his questions, told him that his mother had agreed to stand\r\nsurety for the sum he had borrowed; on which William Paston, to save him\r\nfrom the usurers, offered to advance the remaining 100 marks himself,\r\nand with this view placed, apparently unsolicited, 500 marks’ worth of\r\nhis own plate in pawn. Sir John thought the plate was in safer custody\r\nthan it would have been at Warwick’s Inn, where, in his uncle’s absence,\r\nit remained in the keeping of his aged grandmother; but he was anxious,\r\nif possible, not to lay himself under this kind of obligation to his\r\nuncle.[293-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 293-1: No. 856.]\r\n\r\nThe manor of Sporle was redeemed, but apparently not without his uncle\r\nWilliam’s assistance. Some other land was mortgaged to his uncle\r\ninstead; but the transaction was no sooner completed than Sir John\r\ndeclared he felt as much anxiety about the land in his uncle’s hand as\r\nhe had before about that which was in Townsend’s. His mother, too, was\r\nnot a little afraid, both for the land and for her own securities. She\r\nsuspected William Paston was only too anxious to gain some advantage\r\nover them. She was jealous also of the influence he exercised over his\r\naged mother, who had recently recovered from an illness, and she wished\r\nthe old lady were again in Norfolk instead of living with her son in\r\nLondon.[293-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 293-2: Nos. 857, 862, 863.]\r\n\r\nSir John remained in debt to his uncle for at least a year,[293-3] and\r\nwhether he repaid him at the end of that time I cannot tell; but\r\ncertainly, if out of debt to his uncle, he was two or three years later\r\nin debt to other men. In 1477 he was unable to meet promptly the claims\r\nof one named Cocket, and was labouring once more to redeem the manor of\r\nSporle, which he had been obliged to mortgage to Townsend a second time.\r\nHis mother, annoyed by his importunity for assistance, told him flatly\r\nshe did not mean to pay his debts, and said she grieved to think what he\r\nwas likely to do with her lands after her decease, seeing that he had\r\nwasted so shamefully what had been left him by his father.[294-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 293-3: No. 875.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 294-1: Nos. 916, 917.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sir John Paston’s claim to Caister.] But, however careless\r\nabout his other property, Sir John, as we have already remarked, always\r\nshowed himself particularly anxious for the recovery of Caister. During\r\nthe whole of the year 1475, when he was abroad at Calais and with the\r\narmy, he makes frequent reference to the matter in his letters. His\r\nbrother John and his uncle William had undertaken to urge his suit in\r\nhis absence to my lord and lady of Norfolk; but he would have come home\r\nand brought it before the king in Parliament, had not the French king at\r\nthat time come to the confines of Picardy, and made the Council of\r\nCalais anxious to retain the services of every available soldier on that\r\nside of the sea.[294-2] He was impatient at the non-fulfilment of a\r\npromise by Bishop Waynflete--‘the slow Bishop of Winchester,’ as he\r\ncalled him--to entreat the duke and duchess in his favour.[294-3] But he\r\nwas consoled by news which reached him before he came home, that the\r\nking himself had spoken to the Duke of Norfolk on the subject, and that,\r\nthough the matter was delayed till next term, the king had commanded the\r\nduke to take good advice on the subject and be sure of the validity of\r\nhis title, for justice would certainly be done without favour to either\r\nparty.[294-4] This report, however, was rather too highly coloured. The\r\nDuchess of Norfolk denied its accuracy to John Paston. The king, she\r\nsaid, had only asked the duke at his departure from Calais how he would\r\ndeal with Caister, and my lord made him no answer. The king then asked\r\nSir William Brandon, one of the duke’s principal councillors, what my\r\nlord meant to do about it. Brandon had already received the king’s\r\ncommands to speak to the duke on the subject, and he said that he had\r\ndone so; but that my lord’s answer was ‘that the king should as soon\r\nhave his life as that place.’ The king then inquired of the duke if he\r\nhad actually said so, and the duke said yes. On this the king simply\r\nturned his back without another word, although, as my lady informed John\r\nPaston, if he had spoken one word more, the duke would have made no\r\nrefusal. John Paston, however, informed her ladyship that he would no\r\nlonger be retained in the duke’s service.[295-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 294-2: No. 864.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 294-3: No. 873.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 294-4: Nos. 875, 876.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 295-1: No. 877.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His petition to the king.] Sir John drew up a petition to the\r\nking upon the subject. He showed that the duke had been originally led\r\nto lay claim to Caister by the malice of Sir William Yelverton, William\r\nJenney, and Thomas Howes, who were enfeoffed of that and other lands to\r\nhis use; that upon their suggestion the duke had entered the manor by\r\nforce, and also taken from him 600 sheep and 30 neat, besides one\r\nhundred pounds’ worth of furniture; that he had done damage to the place\r\nitself which 200 marks would not suffice to repair, and that he had\r\ncollected the revenues of the lands for three years to the value of\r\n£140. By the mediation of the Bishop of Winchester, the duke had\r\nafterwards restored him to possession of the manor on payment of 500\r\nmarks, and released to him his estate and interest therein by a deed\r\nunder the seals of himself and his co-feoffees, and of the Bishop of\r\nWinchester. Sir John, however, had remained in possession only half a\r\nyear, during which time he had laid out 100 marks in repairs, and £40\r\nfor the ‘outrents’ due for the three years preceding, when the duke\r\nagain forcibly entered the manor, and had kept possession from that time\r\nfor the space of four years and more, refusing to hear any remonstrances\r\non the subject, or to allow Sir John to come to his presence. Moreover,\r\nwhen Sir John had applied to any of my lord’s council, requesting them\r\nto bring the matter before his lordship, they told him that they had\r\nmentioned his request, but that he was always so exceedingly displeased\r\nwith them that they did not dare to urge it. Thus Sir John had lost all\r\nhis cost and trouble for four years, and thrown away 500 marks to no\r\npurpose.[295-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 295-2: No. 879.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1476, 16th Jan.] This petition was probably never\r\npresented to the king. [Sidenote: Death of the Duke of Norfolk.] It must\r\nhave been drawn up in the end of the year 1475, and in the middle of\r\nJanuary 1476 the Duke of Norfolk suddenly died.[295-3] The event seems\r\nto have occurred at his seat at Framlingham, and Sir John Paston, who\r\nwrites to notify it to his brother, must have been there at the\r\ntime,[296-1] intending perhaps to have made one last effort with the\r\nduke’s council or himself, before applying for justice to the king. But\r\nmatters now stood on a different footing, and Sir John, after making his\r\nintention known to the duke’s council, sent a messenger named Whetley to\r\nCaister to assert his rights there. Considering all that had passed, the\r\nact could not reasonably have been wondered at; but his brother John\r\nintimated to him a few days later that it was resented by some of the\r\nlate duke’s servants, as showing great want of respect for their\r\nmaster.[296-2] This imputation Sir John repudiated, pointing out most\r\ntruly that no wise man could have blamed him, even if he had anticipated\r\nthe duke’s decease, and entered Caister an hour before it took place.\r\nIndeed, considering the justice of his claim, no one could be sorry to\r\nsee Sir John in possession, who was a real friend to the duke, and loved\r\nthe weal of his soul.[296-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 295-3: No. 881.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 296-1: Sir John’s letter is distinctly dated Wednesday\r\n    the 17th January, 15 Edward IV. (1476), and he says the event took\r\n    place ‘this night about midnight.’ It is scarcely probable,\r\n    however, that he wrote within an hour of the occurrence, as he\r\n    mentions having spoken after it with the duke’s council about\r\n    furnishing cloth of gold for the funeral. I suppose therefore that\r\n    the death took place on the night between the 16th and the 17th,\r\n    and that Sir John wrote on the following morning. The date given\r\n    in the _Inquisition post mortem_ (17 Edw. IV., No. 58) is, strange\r\n    to say, erroneous; for it was found in twelve different counties\r\n    that the duke died on _Tuesday after Epiphany_, in the fifteenth\r\n    year of Edward IV., which would have been the 9th January instead\r\n    of the 16th. These inquisitions, however, were not taken till more\r\n    than a year and a half after the event, and it is clear the date\r\n    they give is wrong by a week; but they may, nevertheless, be taken\r\n    as additional evidence that the duke died on a Tuesday and not on\r\n    a Wednesday.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 296-2: No. 883.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 296-3: No. 884.]\r\n\r\nIt is curious to see the notions entertained in that day of the respect\r\ndue to a duke, even from those whom he had very seriously wronged.\r\nHowever, Sir John Paston was not backward in yielding all that was\r\nconventionally due; and in the very letter in which he intimated the\r\nduke’s death to his brother, he says he had promised his council the\r\nloan of some cloth of gold for the funeral. The article was one which it\r\nwas difficult to procure in the country, and he proposed to lend them\r\nsome that he had bought for his father’s tomb.[296-4] His mother\r\nafterwards authorised him to sell it to them, if he could get a\r\nsufficient price for it.[296-5]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 296-4: No. 881.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 296-5: No. 882.]\r\n\r\nSir John, however, after a brief visit to Norwich, hastened up to\r\nLondon. Now was the time that application must be made to the king; for\r\nit would be found by the inquisition that the Duke of Norfolk had\r\nactually died seised of the manor of Caister, and, unless efficient\r\nprotest were made, the title would be confirmed to his widow.[297-1] Sir\r\nJohn’s chief fear seems to have been that writs of _diem clausit\r\nextremum_ would be issued before he had an opportunity of urging reasons\r\nfor delay; in which case the inquisition would speedily be taken, and\r\nall that he could do would be to set forth his claim to the escheator\r\nbefore whom it was held. But he soon found that he need not be over\r\nanxious on this account. The duchess herself was anxious that the writs\r\nshould not be issued too precipitately, and John Paston told his brother\r\nthat he ‘need not deal over largely with the escheators.’[297-2] The\r\nduchess, on the other hand, was suspicious of Sir John, and was warned\r\nto be upon her guard lest he should attempt to retake Caister by the\r\nstrong hand. A favourable opportunity might have been found for such an\r\nattempt at that time, as the moat was frozen and could have been crossed\r\nwith ease. John Paston, however, assured the duchess that his brother\r\nintended to make no entry without her knowledge and assent. The matter\r\nat last was brought before the king’s council, and was decided in Sir\r\nJohn Paston’s favour in May following, all the lords, judges, and\r\nserjeants pronouncing his title good. [Sidenote: Recovery of Caister.]\r\nPrivy seals were then made out for the duchess’s officers to give up\r\npossession, and seven years after the siege of Caister, Sir John was\r\nonce more the acknowledged master of the place.[297-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 297-1: No. 882.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 297-2: No. 885.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 297-3: Nos. 891, 892.]\r\n\r\nThe whole story of the duke’s claim to Caister and of his injustice\r\ntowards Sir John was finally recorded in the inquisition, which was\r\ntaken, after an unusual delay, in October of the year following. It was\r\nshown that Yelverton, Jenney, and Howes, acting without the assent and\r\nagainst the will of the other trustees of Sir John Fastolf’s lands, but\r\nin their names, had made a charter granting to the duke and to Thomas\r\nHoo, Sir Richard Southwell, William Brandon, Ralph Asheton, John\r\nTymperley, and James Hobert, the manors of Caister in Flegg, by Great\r\nYarmouth, called Redham Hall, Vaux, and Bosouns. This charter, which was\r\nnot sealed, was shown to the jury, and it appeared that the said\r\nYelverton, Jenney, and Howes had thereby demised what had belonged to\r\nthem, that is to say, three out of eight parts of the same manors, to\r\nthe said duke and the others. Afterwards the same duke and his\r\nco-feoffees, by the mediation of the Bishop of Winchester, seeing that\r\nthe said demise and enfeoffment was against conscience, and in\r\nconsideration of 500 marks paid by the bishop at the charge of Sir John\r\nPaston, enfeoffed John, Bishop of Hereford, John, Bishop of Coventry and\r\nLichfield, and nine others, to the use of Sir John Paston. These again,\r\nby another deed, gave up their trust to Sir John Paston, and to Guy\r\nFairfax and Richard Pigot, serjeants-at-law, John Paston, Esquire, and\r\nRoger Townsend, whom they enfeoffed to the use of Sir John Paston and\r\nhis heirs for ever. Then the other trustees of Sir John Fastolf\r\nenfeoffed the same Sir John Paston, Fairfax, and the others in the same\r\nway; so that these last became seised to Sir John’s use of the whole\r\nproperty--not merely of the three-eighths originally demised by\r\nYelverton, Jenney, and Howes, but also of the remaining\r\nfive-eighths--until they were violently disseised by the duke, who\r\nenfeoffed thereof Thomas, Archbishop of Canterbury, William, Bishop of\r\nWinchester, Henry, Earl of Essex, Richard Southwell, James Hobert,\r\nRichard Darby, clerk, and John York. After this the duke died; but while\r\nhe lived, Sir John Paston had continually laid claim to the manors in\r\nhis own name and in that of the said Guy Fairfax and others, sometimes\r\nentering the same, and sometimes going as near as he could with safety\r\nto himself. Finally, he entered after the duke’s death, and had been\r\nseised for a long time when the inquisition was taken. The duke,\r\ntherefore, it was found, did not die seised of the manors. It was\r\nfurther found that these manors were holden of the Abbey of St. Benet’s,\r\nHulme.[298-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 298-1: _Inquisition post mortem_, 17 Edw. IV., No. 58.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Death of Charles the Bold_\r\n\r\nThe allusions to public affairs contained in the letters about this time\r\nare of some interest. News came from Rome that a great embassy,\r\nconsisting of Earl Rivers, Lord Ormond, Lord Scrope, and other lords of\r\nEngland, had been honourably received by the pope, but after their\r\ndeparture had been robbed of their plate and jewels at twelve miles’\r\ndistance from Rome. On this they returned to the city to seek a remedy\r\nfor the property they had lost was worth fully a thousand marks.\r\n[Sidenote: Defeat of the Duke of Burgundy by the Swiss.] In the same\r\nletter mention is made of the conquest of Lorraine by the Duke of\r\nBurgundy, and his disastrous expedition into Switzerland immediately\r\nafter. By the first of these events the prospects of Margaret of Anjou\r\nwere seriously impaired, and the French king paid less attention to her\r\ninterests. In the second, the victorious career of Charles the Bold had\r\nbeen already checked by the first great defeat at Grandson. His vanguard\r\nhad been broken, his artillery captured by the Swiss, his whole army\r\nrepulsed, and booty of enormous value left in the hands of the enemy.\r\n‘And so,’ as Sir John Paston reports the matter, ‘the rich saletts,\r\nhelmets, garters, nowches gilt, and all is gone, with tents, pavilions,\r\nand all; and so men deem his pride is abated. Men told him that they\r\nwere froward karls, but he would not believe it. And yet men say that he\r\nwill to them again. God speed them both!’[299-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 299-1: No. 889.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His death. A.D. 1477, 5th Jan.] This expectation, as we know,\r\nwas verified, and the result was that the defeat of Charles at Grandson\r\nwas followed by another still more decisive defeat at Morat. Yet\r\nCharles, undaunted, only transferred the scene of action to Lorraine,\r\nwhere he met with his final defeat and death at Nancy. The event made a\r\nmighty change. The duchy which he had nearly succeeded in erecting into\r\nan independent kingdom, and which, though nominally in feudal subjection\r\nto France, had been in his day a first-rate European power, now fell to\r\na female. The greatness of Burgundy had already departed, and the days\r\nof its feudal independence were numbered. To England the state of\r\nmatters was one of deep concern, for, should France turn hostile again,\r\nthe keeping of Calais might not be so easy, unless the young Duchess\r\nMary could succeed in organising a strong government in the Low\r\nCountries. A Great Council was accordingly convoked by the king, and met\r\non the 18th of February. The world, as Sir John Paston wrote, seemed to\r\nbe ‘all quavering.’ Disturbance was sure to break out somewhere, so that\r\n‘young men would be cherished.’ A great comfort this, in Sir John’s\r\nopinion, and he desires his brother John to ‘take heart’\r\naccordingly.[300-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 300-1: No. 900.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conclusion of the Family History_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John Paston and Margery Brews.] His brother John, however,\r\nfound occupation of a more peaceful character. About this very time he\r\nhad met with a lady named Margery Brews, daughter of Sir Thomas Brews,\r\nand had clearly determined in his own mind that she would be a desirable\r\nwife for him. In the spring of the year 1476, he had heard that a\r\ncertain Mrs. Fitzwalter had a sister to marry, and thought his brother\r\nSir John might negotiate a match for him in that quarter;[300-2] but the\r\naffair fell through, apparently because his brother refused to stand\r\nsurety that he would make her a jointure of 50 marks a year.[300-3] Not\r\nmany months, however, passed away, when he and Dame Elizabeth Brews were\r\nin correspondence about his proposed marriage with her daughter. He had\r\npromised the mother not to speak his mind to the young lady herself till\r\nhe had come to an agreement with her parents; but Margery, I suppose,\r\nhad read his purpose without an explicit declaration, or had forced it\r\nout of him. At all events she was no coy heroine of the modern type, but\r\nhad a very decided mind upon the subject, and gave her mother no peace\r\nwith her solicitations to bring the matter to effect.[300-4]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 300-2: No. 890.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 300-3: No. 892.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 300-4: Nos. 894, 895, 896.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1477, Feb.] Her mother, for her part, was not unwilling,\r\nand believing that pecuniary matters might be easily arranged with her\r\nhusband, wrote to John Paston in February, reminding him that Friday was\r\nValentine’s Day, when every bird chose him a mate. She also invited him\r\nto visit her on Thursday night, and stay till Monday, when she hoped he\r\nwould have an opportunity of speaking to her husband. In fact, she\r\nshowed herself quite eager for the match, and alluding apparently to\r\nsome difficulty made by her husband to terms that had been already\r\noffered, said it was but a simple oak that was cut down at the first\r\nstroke.[301-1] Thus encouraged, John Paston persevered in his suit, and\r\nMargery wrote him very warm and ardent letters, calling him her\r\nwell-beloved valentine, and vowing that she would accept him with half\r\nthe ‘livelode’ he actually possessed.[301-2] The question, however, was\r\nhow much the father could afford to give along with his daughter, and\r\nwhat Margaret Paston and Sir John could do that they might have a\r\nreasonable settlement. Sir John Paston’s answer was very discouraging.\r\nHe felt himself in no condition to help his brother, and after pointing\r\nout the difficulty of acting on some of his suggestions, he added in a\r\nsurly fashion: ‘This matter is driven thus far forth without my counsel;\r\nI pray you make an end without my counsel. If it be well, I would be\r\nglad; if it be otherwise, it is pity. I pray you trouble me no\r\nmore.’[301-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 301-1: No. 896.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 301-2: Nos. 897, 898.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 301-3: Nos. 902, 909.]\r\n\r\nMargaret Paston, however, showed a mother’s heart in the affair, and\r\nconsented to entail upon the young people her manor of Sparham, if Sir\r\nJohn would consent to ratify the gift, and forgo his prospective\r\ninterest in the succession. Even to this Sir John would not quite\r\nconsent. He wished well to his brother, owned that it would be a pity\r\nthe match should be broken off, and did not wonder at what his mother\r\nhad done; but he saw reasons why he could not ‘with his honesty’ confirm\r\nit. He did not, however, mean to raise any objection. ‘The Pope,’ he\r\nsaid, ‘will suffer a thing to be used, but he will not license, nor\r\ngrant it to be used nor done, and so I.’ He would be as kind a brother\r\nas could be, and if Sir Thomas Brews was afraid he might hereafter\r\ndisturb John Paston and his wife in the possession of the manor, he was\r\nquite ready to give a bond that he would attempt no such thing. The\r\nmanor was not his, and he professed he did not covet it.[301-4]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 301-4: Nos. 910, 911.]\r\n\r\nSir John seems really to have desired his brother’s happiness, though\r\nfrom his own bad management he knew not how to help him.[302-1] Hitherto\r\nhe had been the mediator of all such schemes for him, probably because\r\nthe younger brother believed his prospects to be mainly dependent upon\r\nthe head of the house; and I am sorry to say he had been employed in the\r\nlike duty even after John Paston had begun to carve for himself. For it\r\nis clear that after receiving those warm letters from Margery Brews, in\r\nwhich she called him her valentine, and was willing to share his lot if\r\nit were with half his actual means, he had commissioned his brother once\r\nmore to make inquiries about a certain Mistress Barly. Sir John’s\r\nreport, however, was unfavourable. It was ‘but a bare thing.’ Her income\r\nwas insignificant, and she herself was insignificant in person; for he\r\nhad taken the pains to see her on his brother’s account. She was said to\r\nbe eighteen years of age, though she looked but thirteen; but if she was\r\nthe mere girl that she looked, she might be a woman one day.[302-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 302-1: No. 913.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 302-2: No. 903.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps, after all, like Captain Absolute, John Paston had more a mind\r\nof his own in the matter than might be inferred from his giving so many\r\ncommissions to another to negotiate a wife for him. At all events, if he\r\nhad not made up his mind before, he seems really to have made it up now,\r\nand he steered his way between difficulties on the one side and on the\r\nother with a good deal of curious diplomacy, for which we may refer the\r\nreader to the letters themselves.[302-3] In the end, though Sir John\r\nseems to have been in vain urged by his mother to show himself more\r\nliberal,[302-4] all other obstacles were removed, and during the autumn\r\nof the year 1477 the marriage took effect.[302-5]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 302-3: Nos. 901, 904, 905, 913, 915.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 302-4: No. 916.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 302-5: No. 923.]\r\n\r\nBefore Christmas in that same year, it had become apparent that children\r\nwould soon follow of their union;[302-6] and after the New Year John\r\nPaston took Margery to her father’s house to be with her friends a short\r\ntime, while yet she could go about with ease.[302-7] Their eldest child\r\nwas born in the following summer, and received the name of\r\nChristopher.[302-8] Other children followed very soon,[303-1] and by the\r\ntime they had been seven years married, John and Margery Paston had two\r\nlads old enough to be sent on messages,[303-2] besides, in all\r\nprobability, one or more daughters. It was, however, their second son,\r\nWilliam,[303-3] that continued their line, and became the ancestor of\r\nthe future Earls of Yarmouth.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 302-6: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 302-7: No. 925.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 302-8: No. 936.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 303-1: No. 982.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 303-2: No. 999.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 303-3: He was a lawyer of some eminence, received the\r\n    honour of knighthood from Henry VIII., and was Sheriff of Norfolk\r\n    in 1517-18. He died in 1554. It was his grandson, another Sir\r\n    William, whose name is so well known in Norfolk as the founder of\r\n    the North Walsham Grammar School.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Duke of Suffolk again gives trouble.] In the spring of\r\n1478 Sir John Paston was again involved in a dispute with a powerful\r\nnobleman. The Duke of Suffolk revived his old claim to Hellesdon and\r\nDrayton, and ventured to sell the woods to Richard Ferror, the Mayor of\r\nNorwich, who thereupon began to cut them down. Sir John brought the\r\nmatter into Chancery, and hastened up to London. Ferror professed great\r\nregret, and said he had no idea but that the manor was in peaceable\r\npossession of the duke, adding that if Sir John had sent him the\r\nslightest warning, he would have refrained from making such a bargain.\r\nThis, however, was a mere pretence; for, as Sir John remarked to his\r\nbrother, he must certainly have spoken about the matter beforehand with\r\nsome well-informed men in Norwich, who would have set him right.[303-4]\r\nAt all events Ferror went on with what he had begun, and nearly the\r\nwhole of Drayton wood was felled by Corpus Christi Day, the 20th day of\r\nMay. Whetley, a servant of Sir John Paston, who had been sent down from\r\nLondon on the business, writes on that day to his master that the duke\r\nhad made a formal entry into Hellesdon on Wednesday in Whitsun week. He\r\ndined at the manor-house, ‘drew a stew, and took plenty of fish.’ I\r\nsuppose from what follows that he also held a court as lord of the\r\nmanor. ‘At his being there that day,’ writes Whetley, ‘there was never\r\nno man that played Herod in Corpus Christi play better and more\r\nagreeable to his pageant than he did. But ye shall understand that it\r\nwas afternoon, and the weather hot, and he so feeble for sickness that\r\nhis legs would not bear him, but there was two men had great pain to\r\nkeep him on his feet. And there ye were judged. Some said “Slay”; some\r\nsaid “Put him in prison.” And forth come my lord, and he would meet you\r\nwith a spear, and have none other ’mends for the trouble ye have put him\r\nto but your heart’s blood, and that will he get with his own hands; for\r\nand ye have Hellesdon and Drayton, ye shall have his life with\r\nit.’[304-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 303-4: Nos. 929, 930.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 304-1: No. 932.]\r\n\r\nIt appears, however, that the Duke of Suffolk was not in high favour\r\nwith the king, and it was considered at this time that Sir John Paston’s\r\ninfluence at court was very high. Although the affair with Anne Haute\r\nhad been broken off, it was expected that he would marry some one nearly\r\nrelated to the queen’s family; and Margaret Paston thought it a strong\r\nargument for the match, if her son could find it in his heart to love\r\nthe lady, that it would probably set at rest the question of his title\r\nto Hellesdon and Drayton.[304-2] This ambitious hope was not destined to\r\nbe gratified. We know not even who the lady was that is thus referred\r\nto; and as to the dispute with the Duke of Suffolk, it remained\r\nunsettled at least a year and a half--in fact, as long as Sir John\r\nPaston lived.[304-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 304-2: No. 933.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 304-3: No. 956.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The manor of Oxnead.] Two or three months after the beginning\r\nof this dispute, William Paston the uncle accompanied the Duke of\r\nBuckingham into Norfolk on pilgrimage to the shrine of Our Lady at\r\nWalsingham. At his coming he brought a report that there was likely also\r\nto be trouble in the manor of Oxnead, which belonged to his mother\r\nAgnes, the widow of the judge. The nature of this trouble is not stated;\r\nbut apparently it was either occasioned, like the other, by a claim of\r\nthe Duke of Suffolk, or it was feared the duke might attempt to profit\r\nby it. ‘Wherefore I pray you,’ writes Sir John Paston to his brother,\r\n‘take heed lest that the Duke of Suffolk’s council play therewith now at\r\nthe vacation of the benefice, as they did with the benefice of Drayton,\r\nwhich by the help of Mr. John Salett and Donne, his men, there was a\r\nquest made by the said Donne that found that the Duke of Suffolk was\r\nvery patron, which was false; yet they did it for an evidence.’ Whether\r\nthe duke’s council attempted the same policy on this occasion, we cannot\r\nsay; but by some means or other the Paston family were hindered from\r\nexercising their right of presentation, so that they very nearly lost\r\nit. A rector named Thomas, presented to the living by Agnes Paston three\r\nyears before, died in March 1478. On the 5th August following, Agnes\r\nPaston made out letters of presentation in favour of Dr. Richard\r\nLincoln, but for some reason or other this presentation did not pass;\r\nand eight days later she presented a certain Sir William Holle, who we\r\nare told ran away. Her rights, however, were contested; and after the\r\nbenefice had remained more than a year vacant, some insisted that it had\r\nlapsed to the bishop by the patron not having exercised her rights\r\nwithin six months. She had, however, as a matter of fact, delivered Sir\r\nWilliam Holle his presentation within that period; and though he did not\r\navail himself of it, she was, after a good deal of trouble, allowed to\r\npresent again.[305-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 305-1: Nos. 934, 935, 936, 937, 943.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Walter Paston.] In the spring of 1478 Margaret Paston had a\r\nserious illness, and, thinking that it would carry her off, she made her\r\nwill. She lived, however, six years longer, and the will she had made\r\nwas superseded by another dated on the 4th of February 1482.[305-2] For\r\nin the interval considerable changes took place in the family, which we\r\nshall mention presently. At this time she had five, if not six, sons and\r\ntwo daughters, but the daughters were both of them married; and, as we\r\nhave already intimated, she was particularly anxious about her son\r\nWalter, who was now at Oxford being educated for the priesthood.[305-3]\r\nHe had not yet taken orders, when his mother, finding some benefice\r\nvacant, of which she expected to have the disposal,[305-4] thought of\r\nconferring it upon him, and took advice upon the matter of Dr. Pykenham,\r\nJudge of the Court of Arches. She was told, however, that her intention\r\nwas quite against the canon law for three reasons: first, because her\r\nson had not received the tonsure, which was popularly called Benet;\r\nsecondly, he had not attained the lawful age of four-and-twenty; and\r\nthirdly, he would require to take priest’s orders within a twelvemonth\r\nafter presentation to the benefice, unless he had a dispensation from\r\nthe Pope, which Dr. Pykenham felt sure he could never obtain.[306-1] His\r\nprogress at Oxford, however, seems to have given satisfaction to his\r\ntutor, Edmund Alyard, who reports on the 4th March 1479 that he might\r\ntake a bachelor’s degree in art when he pleased, and afterwards proceed\r\nto the faculty of law.[306-2] This course he intended to pursue; and he\r\ntook his degree at Midsummer accordingly,[306-3] then returned home to\r\nNorwich for the vacation. His career, however, was arrested by sudden\r\nillness, and he died in August. He left a will, hastily drawn up before\r\nhis death, by which it appears that he was possessed of the manor of\r\nCressingham, which he bequeathed to his brother John Paston, with a\r\nproviso that if ever he came to inherit the lands of his father it\r\nshould go to his other brother Edmund. He also possessed a flock of\r\nsheep at Mautby, which he desired might be divided between his sister\r\nAnne Yelverton and his sister-in-law Margery, John Paston’s wife.[306-4]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 305-2: Nos. 932, 978.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 305-3: No. 931.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 305-4: Oxnead, which was certainly vacant at the date\r\n    which I have supposed to be that of Margaret Paston’s application\r\n    to Dr. Pykenham, was in her mother-in-law Agnes Paston’s gift; but\r\n    it is not at all unlikely that this was the living in question, as\r\n    she may reasonably have expected to be able to prevail upon the\r\n    old lady to give it to her grandson.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 306-1: No. 941.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 306-2: No. 949.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 306-3: Nos. 945, 946.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 306-4: No. 950.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Clement.] Of Margaret Paston’s other sons one named Clement\r\nis mentioned in Fenn’s pedigree of the family; but he is nowhere spoken\r\nof in the correspondence. I presume that Fenn was not without authority\r\nfor inserting his name in the family tree, and I have surmised that he\r\nwas one of the ‘young soldiers,’ about whom Margaret Paston was\r\nsolicitous, who went over to Calais in 1475. He may perhaps have died\r\nsoon after. The absence of his name, especially in his mother’s will, is\r\nat least strong presumptive evidence that he was not alive in 1482.\r\n[Sidenote: Edmund and William.] Edmund Paston, another brother, was\r\nprobably of about the same age as Walter, perhaps a year or two older;\r\nand the youngest of the family was William, who in the beginning of the\r\nyear 1479 was learning to make Latin verses at Eton.[306-5] He must have\r\nbeen at this time barely nineteen years of age;[306-6] but he had\r\nprecociously fallen in love with a certain Margaret Alborow. He writes\r\nto his brother John Paston how he first became acquainted with her at\r\nthe marriage of her elder sister,--that she was not more than eighteen\r\nor nineteen (which was just about his own age); that she was to have a\r\nportion in money and plate whenever she was married, but he was afraid\r\nno ‘livelode’ or lands till after her mother’s decease. His brother\r\nJohn, however, could find out that by inquiry.[307-1] As might have been\r\nexpected, this calf-love came to nothing. I do not know if William\r\nPaston ever married at all. At a more advanced age his brother Edmund\r\nwrites to him offering to visit on his behalf a widow, who had just\r\n‘fallen’ at Worsted, whose deceased husband had been worth £1000, and\r\nhad left her 100 marks in money, with plate of the same value, and £10 a\r\nyear in land.[307-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 306-5: No. 942. _See_ a previous letter of his, No. 939,\r\n    and also a notice of his schooling as early as August 1477, when\r\n    Margaret Paston writes to Sir John to pay for his board and\r\n    school-hire, gowns, and other necessaries (No. 917).]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 306-6: No. 842.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 307-1: No. 942.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 307-2: No. 974.]\r\n\r\nFor Edmund Paston himself the same kind of office had been performed in\r\n1478 by his brother John, who, having heard while in London of ‘a goodly\r\nyoung woman to marry,’ spoke with some of her friends, and got their\r\nconsent to her marrying his brother. She was a mercer’s daughter, and\r\nwas to have a portion of £200 in ready money, and 20 marks a year in\r\nland after the decease of a stepmother, who was close upon fifty. This\r\nmatch, however, did not take effect, and about three years later Edmund\r\nPaston married Catherine, the widow of William Clippesby.[307-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 307-3: No. 975. There is an oversight in the preliminary\r\n    note to this letter. The date is certainly 1481, and no later, as\r\n    Margaret Paston in her will makes bequests not only to Edmund and\r\n    his wife Catherine, but to their son Robert, who must therefore\r\n    have been born before February 1482.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Agnes Paston;] The year 1479 was, like several of\r\nthe years preceding, one of great mortality, and it was marked by\r\nseveral deaths in the Paston family. The grave had not yet closed over\r\nWalter Paston, when news came to Norwich of the death of his\r\ngrandmother, old Agnes Paston, the widow of the judge. At the same time\r\nJohn Paston’s wife, Margery, gave birth, in her husband’s absence, to a\r\nchild that died immediately after it was born.[307-4] This perhaps was a\r\nmere accidental coincidence. Two months later Sir John Paston found it\r\nnecessary to go up to London on business, partly, it would seem, about\r\nhis dispute with the Duke of Suffolk, and partly, perhaps, to keep watch\r\non the proceedings of his uncle William with regard to the lands of his\r\ngrandmother; for it appears that his uncle, who immediately on his\r\nmother’s death laid claim to the manor of Marlingford,[308-1] had been\r\nmaking certain applications to the escheator on the subject, which were\r\nnaturally viewed with jealousy. On his arrival in town, Sir John found\r\nhis chamber ill ventilated, and his ‘stuff not so clean’ as he had\r\nexpected. He felt uneasy for fear of the prevailing sickness,\r\nand some disappointments in money matters added sensibly to his\r\ndiscomfort.[308-2] [Sidenote: and of Sir John Paston.] He fell ill, and\r\ndied in November. John Paston was on the point of riding up to London to\r\nhave brought down his body with that of his grandmother, who had been\r\nkept unburied nearly three months, to lay them both in Bromholm Priory,\r\nbeside his father. But he was met by a messenger, who told him that his\r\nbrother had already been buried at the White Friars, in London.[308-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 307-4: No. 952.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 308-1: No. 953.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 308-2: No. 956.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 308-3: No. 962.]\r\n\r\n  [[Sidenote: Death of Agnes Paston;\r\n  _not an error: sentence continues later_]]\r\n\r\nWe cannot close the record of Sir John Paston’s life without a certain\r\nfeeling of regret. The very defects of his character give an interest to\r\nit which we do not feel in that of his father or of his brother John. He\r\nis a careless soldier, who loves adventure, has some influence at court,\r\nmortgages his lands, wastes his property, and is always in difficulties.\r\nUnsuccessful in love himself, he yet does a good deal of wooing and\r\ncourting disinterestedly in behalf of a younger brother. He receives\r\nsprightly letters from his friends, with touches of broad humour\r\noccasionally, which are not worse than might be expected of the\r\nunrestrained freedom of the age.[308-4] He patronises literature too,\r\nand a transcriber copies books for him.[308-5] With his death the\r\ndomestic interest of the Paston Letters almost comes to an end, and the\r\nquantity of the correspondence very greatly diminishes. The love-making,\r\nthe tittle-tattle, and a good deal of the humour disappear, and the few\r\ndesultory letters that remain relate, for the most part, either to\r\npolitics or to business.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 308-4: Nos. 906-908.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 308-5: No. 695.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The title to Marlingford and Oxnead.] As soon as the news of\r\nhis death arrived in Norfolk, John Paston wrote to his mother, desiring\r\nthat his brother Edmund would ride to Marlingford, Oxnead, Paston,\r\nCromer, and Caister, to intimate his right of succession to the tenants\r\nof these different manors, and to warn those of Marlingford and Oxnead\r\nto pay no rents to the servants or officers of his uncle William.[309-1]\r\nThese two manors, the reader will remember, belonged to Agnes Paston;\r\nand her son William, with whom she lived, had doubtless watched the old\r\nlady’s failing health, and made preparations even before her actual\r\ndecease to vindicate his claim to them as soon as the event\r\noccurred.[309-2] The manors, however, having been entailed under Judge\r\nPaston’s will, properly descended to Sir John Paston, and after his\r\ndeath to his brother John. In accordance, therefore, with his brother’s\r\ninstructions, Edmund Paston rode to Marlingford on Sunday before St.\r\nAndrew’s Day, ‘and before all the tenants examined one James, keeper\r\nthere for William Paston, where he was the week next before St. Andrew;\r\nand there he said that he was not at Marlingford from the Monday unto\r\nthe Thursday at even, and so there was no man there but your brother’s\r\nman at the time of his decease’ (we are quoting a letter of William\r\nLomnour to John Paston). ‘So by that your brother died seised. And your\r\nbrother Edmund bade your man keep possession to your behoof, and warned\r\nthe tenants to pay no man till ye had spoken to them.’ In the afternoon\r\nEdmund went on to Oxnead, where a servant named Piers kept possession\r\nfor Sir John Paston, and he found that William Paston’s agent was not\r\nthere at the time, but had ordered another man to be there in his place.\r\nWhether that amounted to a continuance of the possession of William\r\nPaston, was a point to be considered.[309-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 309-1: No. 962.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 309-2: No. 940.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 309-3: No. 963.]\r\n\r\nAs usual in such cases, farmers and tenants had everywhere a bad time of\r\nit until uncle and nephew were agreed. John Paston’s men threatened\r\nthose of his uncle William at Harwellbury, while, on the other hand, his\r\nuncle William’s men molested those of John Paston at Marlingford.[309-4]\r\nDuring the interval between Agnes Paston’s death and that of Sir John,\r\nthe tenants at Cromer had been uncertain who was to be their lord, and\r\nat Paston there was a similar perplexity.[309-5] Sir John’s bailiff\r\nordered the Paston tenants to pay no rents to Mr. William Paston; but\r\none Henry Warns wrote to Mr. William of the occurrence, and ordered them\r\nto pay none to any one else. After Sir John’s death Warns still\r\ncontinued to be troublesome, making tenants afraid to harrow or sow lest\r\nthey should lose their labour, pretending that John Paston had given him\r\npower over everything he had himself in the place.[310-1] Things went on\r\nin this unpleasant fashion for a period of at least five years.[310-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 309-4: Nos. 970, 982, 983.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 309-5: No. 957.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 310-1: Nos. 852 and 853, which by inadvertence I have\r\n    assigned to the year 1474. They are undoubtedly of the year 1479,\r\n    the former being written just before Sir John Paston’s death, and\r\n    the latter after it.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 310-2: No. 998.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Margaret Paston.] Margaret Paston survived her son\r\nSir John five years, and died in 1484, in the reign of Richard\r\nIII.[310-3] In her very interesting will, made two years before her\r\ndecease, a number of bequests of a religious and charitable kind show\r\nhow strongly she felt the claims of the poor, the sick, and the needy,\r\nas well as those of hospitals, friars, anchoresses, and parish churches.\r\nFrom the bequests she makes to her own family, it appears that not only\r\nJohn Paston, her eldest surviving son, but his brother Edmund also, was\r\nby that time married, and had children. To Edmund she gives ‘a standing\r\npiece white covered, with a garlick head upon the knop,’ ‘a gilt piece\r\ncovered, with a unicorn,’ a feather bed and a ‘transom,’ and some\r\ntapestry. To his wife Catherine she leaves a purple girdle ‘harnessed\r\nwith silver and gilt,’ and some other articles; and to their son Robert,\r\nwho must have been quite an infant, all her swans marked with\r\n‘Daubeney’s mark,’ to remain with him and his heirs for ever. Various\r\nother articles are left to her daughter Anne, wife of William Yelverton,\r\nto her son William, to John and Margery Paston, and to their son William\r\nand to their daughter Elizabeth (apparently Christopher Paston, the\r\neldest child, was by this time dead), and also to Constance, a natural\r\ndaughter of Sir John Paston. She also left £20 to John Calle, son of her\r\ndaughter Margery, when he should come to be twenty years of age, and if\r\nhe died before that, it was to be divided between his brothers William\r\nand Richard when they grew up. To Margery Calle herself and her husband\r\nRichard she left nothing.[311-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 310-3: The exact date is given as the 4th November 1484\r\n    in a calendar prefixed to an old MS. missal in the possession of\r\n    the late Mr. C. W. Reynell.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 311-1: No. 978.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Times of Richard III. and Henry VII._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Richard III.] The personal interest of the correspondence is\r\nnot altogether exhausted, although, as we have already remarked, it is\r\nvery greatly diminished after the death of Sir John Paston. But the\r\npolitical interest of the remaining letters is so great, that they are\r\nalmost more indispensable to the historian than the preceding ones. The\r\nbrief and troubled reign of Richard III. receives illustration from two\r\nletters of the Duke of Norfolk to John Paston. The first was written in\r\nanticipation of Buckingham’s rebellion, requiring him to make ready and\r\ncome to London immediately with ‘six tall fellows in harness,’ as the\r\nKentish men were up in the Weald, and meant to come and rob the\r\ncity.[311-2] Again, on the Earl of Richmond’s invasion, the duke desires\r\nPaston to meet him at Bury with a company, to be raised at the duke’s\r\nexpense.[311-3] There is also a copy of King Richard’s proclamation\r\nagainst Henry Tudor,[311-4] of which, however, the text is preserved in\r\nother MSS.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 311-2: No. 994.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 311-3: No. 1002.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 311-4: No. 1001.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Henry VII.] The troubles of the reign of Henry VII. at first\r\nwere scarcely less in magnitude than those of the tyrant whom he\r\noverthrew. But somehow or other the new king had the art of discovering\r\nwho was to be trusted and who was not. John Paston was soon found out to\r\nbe a man deserving of confidence. Very early, indeed, in Henry’s reign,\r\nhe must have acquired some influence at court. [Sidenote: John Paston\r\nSheriff of Norfolk.] Two months had not elapsed after the battle of\r\nBosworth when we find him Sheriff of Norfolk. The Duke of Suffolk writes\r\nto him to issue proclamations in the king’s name against certain rebels\r\nwho were in confederacy with the Scots.[311-5] The Countess of Surrey\r\nwrites to him to intercede with my Lord Fitzwalter and the Earl of\r\nOxford in behalf of her imprisoned husband.[311-6] Lady Fitzhugh,\r\na daughter of the great Kingmaker, calls him her son, and requests his\r\nfavour for her daughter Anne, wife of the fugitive Yorkist rebel\r\nFrancis, Viscount Lovel, whose pardon she was making importunate suit to\r\nobtain.[312-1] The king himself writes to him,[312-2] and the Earl of\r\nOxford addresses letters to him as his ‘right well beloved\r\ncouncillor.’[312-3] The earl, of course, was his old friend, and we may\r\npresume it was through his influence that Paston was recommended to the\r\nking’s favour.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 311-5: No. 1006.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 311-6: No. 1004.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 312-1: No. 1008.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 312-2: No. 1010.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 312-3: No. 1012.]\r\n\r\n  [[Footnote 312-2: _missing “2” added_]]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lambert Simnel’s rebellion.] So much honour, trust, and\r\nconfidence had already been bestowed on him when the rebellion of\r\nLambert Simnel broke out in the second year of Henry’s reign. Of that\r\ncommotion we have some interesting illustrations, by which it is clear\r\nthat the gentry of Norfolk were at first doubtful of the success of the\r\nking’s cause, and that many were indisposed to obey his summons to\r\nbattle. Sir William Boleyn and Sir Harry Heydon had gone as far as\r\nThetford on their way towards Kent, when they received advice which\r\ninduced them to return. Sir Edmund Bedingfield wrote to John Paston, he\r\nbelieved that they would not go if the king wanted them. But there were\r\nsimilar rumours about John Paston himself, and it was even said that he\r\nmeditated mischief. It is true he had actually waited on the king, in\r\nthe train, apparently, of the Earl of Oxford, one of the two generals to\r\nwhom the military powers of the whole kingdom were at this time\r\nintrusted; but it was suspected, perhaps owing to the application made\r\nto him on her account, that after my lord’s departure from the king he\r\nhad been with the Viscountess Lovel, whose husband was among the rebel\r\nleaders. ‘But wrath said never well,’ adds Bedingfield in reporting this\r\nrumour to John Paston himself. It was evident that he had enemies, and\r\nit was necessary to conduct himself at such a critical period with\r\nextreme discretion.[312-4]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 312-4: No. 1014.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fear of invasion on the East Coast.] At this time the rebels\r\nhad not yet landed in England. Nothing had been known of their movements\r\ntill very lately; but the Earl of Lincoln had been in Flanders with the\r\nLady Margaret of Burgundy, the chief organiser of the conspiracy. The\r\nEast Coast, it was supposed, was chiefly threatened; and the king had\r\nmade a progress through Suffolk and Norfolk to animate the people to\r\nloyalty. Commissions of array had been issued for the Eastern Counties\r\non the 7th April. On the 15th Henry kept his Easter at Norwich; after\r\nwhich he went on to Walsingham, and thence to Coventry.[313-1] News\r\ncame, however, that seemed to show the East Coast was in no immediate\r\ndanger. The rebels had left the Low Countries, but they had gone to\r\nIreland. The gentlemen of the Eastern Counties were informed that the\r\nking would put them to no further charge at that time, but hoped the\r\ncountry would be ready on reasonable warning.[313-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 313-1: _See_ Spedding’s Notes in Bacon’s Henry\r\n    VII.--_Works of Bacon_, vi. 55, 56.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 313-2: No. 1015.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Stoke.] The extraordinary farce enacted in\r\nIreland--the recognition of Lambert Simnel as the son of Clarence, his\r\ncoronation in Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin, and his enthusiastic and\r\nuniversal reception by a people to whom political truths have been at\r\nall times unimportant, and rebellion a mere amusement,--these were facts\r\nthat could not have been easily realised by sober-minded Englishmen. The\r\nnews, indeed, could scarcely have reached England very much in advance\r\nof the rebel hosts themselves, which presently crossed the sea and\r\nlanded at Furness in Lancashire.[313-3] In less than a fortnight they\r\npenetrated into the heart of England, where they were met by the king’s\r\nforces and suffered a complete overthrow in the battle of Stoke.\r\n[Sidenote: John Paston knighted.] In that battle John Paston was with\r\nthe king’s army, and seems to have done some distinguished service, in\r\nrecognition of which he was knighted by the king upon the field of\r\nbattle. The same honour was conferred at that time upon fifty-one\r\npersons besides himself, while thirteen others were made knights\r\nbannerets.[313-4]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 313-3: It was but on the 5th May, as Spedding has\r\n    pointed out (_Bacon_, 56) that the principal party of the rebels\r\n    landed in Ireland. On the 4th June they had crossed the Channel\r\n    and landed in Lancashire. The coronation of Lambert Simnel took\r\n    place on Ascension Day, the 24th May.--_Rolls of Parl._ vi. 397.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 313-4: No. 1016 and Note at p. 187 (vol. vi.).]\r\n\r\n  [[Sidenote: John Paston knighted.\r\n  _sidenote printed at beginning of paragraph_]]\r\n\r\n  [[“Note at p. 187” = text section headed “Note to No. 1016”,\r\n  immediately before Appendix]]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Deputy to the Earl of Oxford as Admiral.] Sir John Paston, as\r\nhe was now called, continued to maintain his influence with the Earl of\r\nOxford and the king. The earl was Lord High Admiral, and he made Sir\r\nJohn his deputy; in which capacity we find letters addressed to him\r\nabout a whale taken off the coast of Norfolk,[314-1] and deputations\r\nwaiting upon him at Caister from the corporation of Yarmouth,[314-2]\r\nbesides some correspondence with the earl as Admiral.[314-3] He got his\r\nbrother William into the earl’s service; and though ultimately the earl\r\nwas obliged to dismiss him as being ‘troubled with sickness and crased\r\nin his mind,’[314-4] William Paston certainly continued many years in\r\nthe earl’s household. He became, in fact, a means of communication\r\nbetween the earl and his brother, and in one case we have an important\r\nletter addressed to the earl by the king on the subject of the war in\r\nBritanny, copied out by William Paston and forwarded to Sir John.[314-5]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 314-1: Nos. 1029, 1030.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 314-2: No. 924.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 314-3: Nos. 1049, 1050, 1051.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 314-4: No. 940.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 314-5: No. 913.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The war in Britanny.] The eager interest with which this war\r\nin Britanny was watched by Englishmen--the anxiety to learn what had\r\nbecome of English volunteers, and of the forces sent thither afterwards\r\nby the king’s authority--is shown in several of the letters.[314-6] The\r\nfacts relating to the whole affair, and their true chronology, had been\r\na good deal confused and mis-stated until the late Mr. Spedding, in\r\nediting Lord Bacon’s _History of Henry VII._, compared the testimony of\r\nthe Paston Letters with that of other original sources.[314-7] But it\r\nwould take up too much space, and involve writing a complete history of\r\nthe times, to show what important light is thrown upon this and other\r\nsubjects of interest in the reign of Henry VII. by the scattered notices\r\nof political events contained in these letters; and we must be content,\r\nfor the remainder of the period, briefly to indicate the matters of\r\npublic interest referred to.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 314-6: Letters 1026, 1030, 1036. An allusion to this war\r\n    occurs in Barclay’s _Ship of Fools_, f. 152 b.:\r\n\r\n      ‘The battles done, perchance in small Britain,\r\n      In France, in Flanders, or to the worldes end,\r\n      Are told in the quere, of some, in wordes vain\r\n      In midst of matins in stead of the Legende,\r\n      And other gladly to hear the same intend\r\n      Much rather than the service for to hear.’]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 314-7: Spedding’s _Bacon_, vi. 68, 72, 84, 97-8, 101-2.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Earl of Northumberland.] The rising in the North, in\r\nwhich the Earl of Northumberland was slain, is the subject of two\r\nletters;[315-1] and, closely connected with this subject, if our\r\nchronology is to be relied on, is an intended progress of the king into\r\nNorfolk a few weeks earlier, which was abandoned for some reason not\r\nexplained. The Great Council which Henry had summoned on the affairs of\r\nBritanny appears to have been dissolved on the 3rd March 1489. Two days\r\nbefore it separated, the Earl of Northumberland was appointed to protect\r\nthe kingdom against the Scots, and entered into indentures with the king\r\nat Sheen ‘for the keeping out of the Scots and warring on them.’ But\r\ninstead of having an outward enemy to contend with, before two months\r\nhad elapsed he found himself called upon to put down the revolt in\r\nYorkshire, and he was killed on the 28th April.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 315-1: Nos. 1037, 1039.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Intended royal visit to Norfolk.] The king, if his original\r\ndesigns had been adhered to, would by this time have passed through the\r\nEastern Counties, kept his Easter at Norwich, and gone on to\r\nWalsingham.[315-2] In the course of his progress he was to have visited\r\nthe Earl of Oxford at his mansion at Hedingham in Essex, where William\r\nPaston, Sir John’s brother, was staying in the earl’s service. Sir John\r\nhimself had notice from the earl to come to him with the same number of\r\nmen ‘defensably arrayed’ as he had before granted to do the king\r\nservice;[315-3] and in anticipation of the royal visit to Norfolk,\r\nWilliam Paston sent orders to the Bailiff of Mautby to have his horse\r\nBayard well fed, whatever it cost, that the animal might look fat and\r\nsleek when the king came.[315-4] This order, however, it must be\r\nobserved, is provisional, ‘if Bayard be unsold’; and perhaps the proviso\r\nmay point to the reason why the royal progress was abandoned. The\r\nsubsidy which caused the rising in Yorkshire was heavily felt over the\r\nwhole kingdom besides; and though at another time a royal progress might\r\nhave been very popular, the king doubtless saw that it would be\r\nunadvisable to add to the expenses of his subjects at a time when they\r\nwere so severely taxed already.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 315-2: No. 1031.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 315-3: No. 1032.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 315-4: No. 1033.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Creation of Prince Henry as Duke of York.] In No. 1058 we\r\nhave a list of the persons who were made Knights of the Bath on the\r\ncreation of Henry, the king’s second son (afterwards Henry VIII.) as\r\nDuke of York, in November 1494.[316-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 316-1: No. 1058.--This list agrees pretty well with the\r\n    names given in the description of the ceremony printed by me in\r\n    _Letters and Papers of Richard III. and Henry VII._, vol. i. p.\r\n    390. But besides some variations in spelling and a difference in\r\n    one place as to the Christian name, this list includes the names\r\n    of Lords Harington and Clifford, who are not only not mentioned in\r\n    the other as having been made Knights of the Bath on this\r\n    occasion, but who seem to be excluded by the statement that there\r\n    were only twenty baths and beds provided besides those of the\r\n    prince himself.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Perkin Warbeck.] In July 1495, the corporation of Yarmouth\r\nwrite to Sir John Paston about the capture of five captains of Perkin\r\nWarbeck’s host, who landed at Deal with about 140 men, when an invasion\r\nwas attempted by the pretender. Whatever encouragement was given to\r\nPerkin abroad, his appearance off the coast of Kent gave little\r\nsatisfaction to the inhabitants, who killed or took prisoner every man\r\nthat set foot on the land. Perkin, leaving his friends to their mercy,\r\nsailed away, only creating a little disquietude as to where he would\r\nnext make his appearance. One of the captains taken, whose name was\r\nBelt, said he knew he had no hope of mercy, and therefore did not mind\r\nrevealing the plans of his comrades. They meant to gain possession of\r\nYarmouth or to die for it.[316-2] If this was said in good faith, the\r\nrebels must have been so discouraged by their reception at Deal, that\r\nthey changed their plans and went to Ireland. But it may of course have\r\nbeen said purposely in order to mislead. It was, however, effectual in\r\ncreating some alarm about the safety of the town. The corporation\r\nreceived a promise from Sir John Paston that aid should be forthcoming,\r\nif required; but the very next day intelligence was received that the\r\nrebel fleet had sailed westward,[316-3] and doubtless before many days\r\nmore all serious alarm was at an end.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 316-2: No. 1059.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 316-3: No. 1060.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Edmund de la Pole.] The next political letter refers to\r\nEdmund de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk, whose first escape from England was\r\nmade in the summer of 1499. The king was then staying at Godshill, in\r\nthe Isle of Wight, where the Earl of Oxford was with him; and the latter\r\nwrote to Sir John Paston on the 20th August to make inquiry what persons\r\nhad accompanied the fugitive, or were privy to his departure, commanding\r\nhim to take into custody every one whom he could find to have been any\r\nway concerned in the matter, or any ‘suspect’ person who seemed to be\r\n‘of the same affinity,’ found hovering near the sea coasts.[317-1] Writs\r\nwere issued the very same day to the sheriffs of the Eastern Counties to\r\nprevent persons leaving the kingdom without a licence.[317-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 317-1: No. 1065.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 317-2: _Letters and Papers Ric. III. and Hen. VII._,\r\n    vol. ii. p. 377.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Coming of Catherine of Arragon to England.] The next letter\r\nafter this is a notification from the king to Sir John Paston, given on\r\nthe 20th May 1500, that Catherine of Arragon, the affianced bride of\r\nArthur, Prince of Wales, was expected in England in the following May.\r\nSir John Paston was required to be ready to give his attendance at her\r\nreception at that date; but owing to a change of plans, she did not\r\narrive before October 1501.[317-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 317-3: No. 1066.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Meeting of Henry VII. and Philip of Castile.] After this\r\nthere is nothing more relating to public matters during Sir John\r\nPaston’s life; but we must not pass over without notice the very curious\r\naccount given in No. 1078--a letter which, though among the Paston\r\npapers, has no obvious connection with the Paston family at all--of the\r\nmeeting between Henry VII. and Philip, King of Castile, at Clewer, near\r\nWindsor, in January 1506. It is well known how Philip, who until the\r\ndeath of his mother-in-law, Isabella of Spain, was only Archduke of\r\nAustria, had set out from Flanders to take possession of his new\r\ndominions, when, meeting with a storm at sea, he was driven upon the\r\ncoast of England, and was for some time entertained by Henry at his\r\ncourt. This letter gives a minute description of the meeting between the\r\ntwo kings, and of the persons by whom they were accompanied, noting the\r\napparel and liveries of all present, after the fashion of court newsmen.\r\nThe scene unquestionably must have been a striking one; but we must\r\nrefer our readers for the particulars to the letter itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Social Aspect of the Times_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: State of society.] Thus far have we followed the fortunes of\r\nthe Paston family and the history of the times in which they lived, as\r\nillustrated by their correspondence. The reader must not, however,\r\nimagine that we have by any means exhausted the materials before us,\r\neither in their social or in their political bearings. Indeed, to\r\nwhatever length we should prolong these observations, we could not but\r\nleave an ample harvest of facts to be gathered in by others, nor have we\r\nattempted more than to bring the leading points of the story into one\r\nconnected narrative. Of the general condition of society revealed to us\r\nby this remarkable correspondence, we have left the reader to form his\r\nown impressions. But a few very brief remarks upon this subject may\r\nperhaps be expected of us before we conclude.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Education.] The first thing which strikes the most casual\r\nobserver on glancing over these letters, is the testimony they afford to\r\nthe state of education among the people at the period in which they were\r\nwritten. From the extreme scarcity of original letters of such an early\r\ndate, we are too easily led to undervalue the culture and civilisation\r\nof the age. But these letters show that during the century before the\r\nReformation the state of education was by no means so low, and its\r\nadvantages by no means so exceptionally distributed, as we might\r\notherwise imagine. For it is not merely that Judge Paston was a man of\r\nsuperior cultivation, and took care that his family should be endowed\r\nwith all those educational advantages that he had possessed himself.\r\nThis was no doubt the case. But it must be remembered that the majority\r\nof these letters were not written by members of the Paston family, but\r\nwere only addressed to them; and they show that friends, neighbours,\r\nlords, commoners, and domestic servants possessed the art of writing, as\r\nwell as the Pastons themselves. No person of any rank or station in\r\nsociety above mere labouring men seems to have been wholly illiterate.\r\nAll could write letters; most persons could express themselves in\r\nwriting with ease and fluency. Not perhaps that the accomplishment was\r\none in which it was considered an honour to excel. Hands that had been\r\naccustomed to grasp the sword were doubtless easily fatigued with the\r\npen. Old Sir John Fastolf evidently feels it a trouble even to sign his\r\nname, and in his latter years invariably allows others to sign it for\r\nhim. Men of high rank generally sign their letters, but scarcely ever\r\nwrite them with their own hands. And well was it, in many cases, for\r\ntheir correspondents that they did not do it oftener. Whether, like\r\nHamlet, they thought it ‘a baseness to write fair,’ and left such\r\n‘yeoman’s service’ to those who had specially qualified themselves for\r\nit; or whether, absorbed by other pursuits, they neglected an art which\r\nthey got others to practise for them, the nobility were generally the\r\nworst writers of the day. Their handwriting and their spelling were on a\r\npar, and were sometimes so outrageous, that it requires no small effort\r\nof imagination to comprehend the words, even if we could be sure of the\r\nletters.[319-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 319-1: A notable example of this is afforded by the\r\n    letters of Edmund de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk, which will be found\r\n    printed in my _Letters and Papers of Richard III. and Henry VII._\r\n    His successor in title, Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, the\r\n    favourite of Henry VIII., wrote quite as barbarous a hand, and\r\n    outraged orthography in a manner equally bewildering.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Eton College.] Education, nevertheless, was making undoubted\r\nprogress, both among high and low. Eton College and King’s College,\r\nCambridge, had been founded by Henry VI. only a few years before old\r\nJudge Paston died. His grandson and namesake, William Paston, as we have\r\nseen, was sent to the former place for his education, and was learning\r\nto construct Latin hexameters and pentameters there in 1479. His\r\nprogress, it is true, seems to have been but indifferent. What was to be\r\nexpected of a young gentleman of nineteen, whose attention, even while\r\nat school, was distracted by the thought that he had already met with\r\none who might be a partner for life? Nevertheless, in that same letter\r\nin which he writes to his brother John what he knows of Mistress\r\nMargaret Alborow, he sends him also a specimen of his performances in\r\nLatin versification. It is not a very brilliant production, certainly,\r\nbut the fact of his sending it to his elder brother shows that John\r\nPaston too had gone through a regular classical training on the system\r\nwhich has prevailed in all public schools down to the present day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oxford.] It has, moreover, been remarked that the\r\nillustrations both of Eton and of Oxford life in the fifteenth century\r\nbear a striking resemblance to the well-known usages of modern times. It\r\nis true Walter Paston’s expenses at Oxford were not great, even if we\r\ntake into consideration the much higher value of money in that day. For\r\na period of probably half a year they amounted to no more than £6: 5\r\n_s._: 5¾ _d._[320-1] Yet when he became B.A. he gave a banquet, as\r\ngraduates have been accustomed to do since his day, for which he was\r\npromised some venison from Lady Harcourt, but was disappointed.[320-2]\r\nEven the expenses attending the graduation, however, do not appear to\r\nhave been very heavy. ‘It will be some cost to me, but not much,’ wrote\r\nWalter Paston in his own case, though he had been disappointed in the\r\nhope of passing at the same time as Lionel Woodville, the queen’s\r\nbrother, afterwards Bishop of Salisbury, who apparently would have borne\r\na portion of the expenses of his fellow-graduates.[320-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 320-1: No. 931.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 320-2: No. 946.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 320-3: No. 945.]\r\n\r\nFrom the letters just referred to we are reminded that it was at this\r\ntime usual for those who received a liberal education not only to take a\r\ndegree in arts but to proceed afterwards in the faculty of law. At the\r\nuniversities, unfortunately, law is studied no longer, and degrees in\r\nthat faculty are now purely honorary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mode of computing dates.] Some other points may be suggested\r\nto us, even by the most superficial examination of the contents of these\r\nvolumes. The mode in which the letters are dated by their writers shows\r\nclearly that our ancestors were accustomed to measure the lapse of time\r\nby very different standards from those now in use. Whether men in\r\ngeneral were acquainted with the current year of the Christian era may\r\nbe doubted; that was an ecclesiastical computation rather than one for\r\nuse in common life. They seldom dated their letters by the year at all,\r\nand when they did it was not by the year of our Lord, but by the year of\r\nthe king’s reign. Chronicles and annals of the period, which give the\r\nyear of our Lord, are almost always full of inaccuracies in the figures;\r\nand altogether it is evident that an exact computation of years was a\r\nthing for which there was considered to be little practical use. As to\r\nmonths and days, the same remark does not apply. Letters were very\r\nfrequently dated in this respect according to what is the general usage\r\nnow. But even here, as the reader will not fail to observe, there was a\r\nmuch more common use of Festivals and Saints’ days, and when a letter\r\nwas not written on a day particularly marked in the Calendar, it was\r\nfrequently dated the Monday or Wednesday, or whatever day of the week it\r\nmight happen to be, _before_ or _after_ such a celebration. Agnes Paston\r\neven dates a letter during the week by the collect of the Sunday\r\npreceding:--‘Written at Paston in haste, the Wednesday next after _Deus\r\nqui errantibus_.’[321-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 321-1: No. 34.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mode of reckoning.] Of their modes of computing other things\r\nwe have little indication in these volumes except in money accounts,\r\nwhich are always kept in Roman figures. No separate columns are set\r\napart in MSS. of this date (although for the convenience of the reader\r\nthis has sometimes been done in print) for the different denominations\r\nof pounds, shillings, pence, and marks, so that it would have been\r\nimpossible for the best arithmetician easily to cast up totals after the\r\nmodern fashion. The arithmeticians of that day, in fact, had a totally\r\ndifferent method of reckoning. They used counters, and had a\r\ncounting-board or abacus, on which they set up the totals.[321-2] An\r\ninstance of this occurs in the first volume, where John Paston, in\r\nsuperintending the works at Caister Castle, or, as we now rather\r\nsuspect, at Mautby, thought it advisable to change the room in which his\r\ncoffers and his ‘countewery’ should be set. In connection with this\r\nincident one other point is worthy of observation. On taking the measure\r\nof the new room, John Paston’s wife reported that he would find it less\r\nconvenient than the former one. ‘There is no space,’ she wrote, ‘beside\r\nthe bed, though the bed were removed to the door, to set both your board\r\nand your coffers there, and to have space to go and sit beside.’[321-3]\r\nWhen it is considered that the room in question was a ‘draught chamber,’\r\nthat is to say, that it contained a privy in addition to the furniture\r\nwhich Paston intended to introduce, want of space ought certainly to\r\nhave been a very serious objection.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 321-2: The modern mode of adding up columns of arabic\r\n    numerals was called _Algorism_ or _Awgrym_. Thus Palsgrave gives\r\n    as an example of the use of the word--‘I shall reken it syxe times\r\n    by aulgorisme, or you can caste it ones by\r\n    counters.’--_Promptorium Parv._ i. 18.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 321-3: No. 224.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Manner of living.] The neglect of sanitary considerations in\r\ndomestic architecture--indeed, in domestic matters generally--was no\r\ndoubt a prolific source of disease and pestilence. Yet the general plan\r\nof daily life pursued by our ancestors was, it must be owned, more\r\nwholesome than that of the nineteenth century. It is well known that\r\nthey were early risers. Innumerable patent kinds of artificial light did\r\nnot tempt them to waste the natural hours of rest either in study or in\r\ndissipation. Their meals too were earlier. Their dinner was at noon, if\r\nnot before; and after dinner, in the long summer days, it was customary\r\nto take some additional repose. Thus Henry Windsor concludes a letter to\r\nJohn Paston--‘Written in my sleeping time at afternoon, on\r\nWhitsunday.’[322-1] This practice of sleeping in the daytime was so\r\nuniversal that in the case of labourers it was only thought necessary to\r\nkeep it within certain limits, and to restrict it by Act of Parliament\r\nto a quarter of the year, from the middle of May to the middle of\r\nAugust.[322-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 322-1: No. 332.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 322-2: Statute 6 Hen. VIII. ch. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sending dinners out.] A curious practice in relation to\r\ndining mentioned in Letter 423 has already been incidentally alluded to.\r\nIt was the year after Sir John Fastolf’s death, and John Paston’s wife\r\nhad gone out of Norwich to reside at Hellesdon. Paston’s increased\r\nimportance in the county was shown by the Mayor and Mayoress of Norwich\r\none day _sending their dinners out_ to Hellesdon, and coming to dine\r\nwith Margaret Paston. Of this kind of compliment we have another\r\nillustration in More’s _History of Richard III._ It is well known how,\r\nwhen just after the death of Edward IV. the Earl of Rivers and Lord\r\nRichard Grey were conducting the boy king Edward V. up to London, they\r\nwere overtaken by the Duke of Gloucester at Stony Stratford, and placed\r\nunder arrest. As the story is reported by More, Gloucester at first\r\ntreated his prisoners with courtesy, and at dinner sent a dish from his\r\nown table to Lord Rivers, praying him to be of good cheer, for all\r\nshould be well enough. ‘And he thanked the duke,’ continues the\r\nhistorian, ‘and prayed the messenger to bear it to his nephew the Lord\r\nRichard with the same message for his comfort, who he thought had more\r\nneed of comfort as one to whom such adversity was strange; but himself\r\nhad been all his days in ure therewith, and therefore could bear it the\r\nbetter.’\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chivalry and courtesy.] The courtesies of life were certainly\r\nnot less valued in those rough unquiet days than in our own. Although\r\nmen like Caxton lamented the decline of chivalry, its civilising\r\ninfluence continued, and its most important usages were still kept up.\r\nAmong the books which William Ebesham transcribed for Sir John Paston at\r\nthe rate of twopence a leaf, was one which was called _The Great Book_,\r\ntreating of ‘the Coronation and other Treatises of Knighthood,’ ‘of the\r\nmanner of making joust and tournaments,’ and the like.[323-1] His\r\nlibrary, or that of his brother John, contained also ‘the Death of\r\nArthur,’ the story of Guy of Warwick, chronicles of the English kings\r\nfrom Cœur de Lion to Edward III., the legend of Guy and Colbrand, and\r\nvarious other chronicles and fictions suited to knightly culture;\r\nbesides moral treatises, like Bishop Alcock’s _Abbey of the Holy Ghost_,\r\nand poetical and imaginative books, such as the poems of Chaucer--at\r\nleast his _Troilus and Cressida_, his _Legend of Ladies_ (commonly\r\ncalled _The Legend of Good Women_), his _Parliament of Birds_, the\r\n_Belle Dame sauns Mercie_, and Lydgate’s _Temple of Glass_. Books like\r\nthese formed part of the recreations of a country gentleman. They\r\ncontained, doubtless, the fund of ideas which fathers communicated to\r\ntheir children around the winter fire. And the children were the better\r\nqualified to appreciate them by an education which was entirely founded\r\nupon the principles of chivalry.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 323-1: Nos. 695, 987.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The training of the young.] It was in accordance with these\r\nprinciples, and to maintain a true sense of order in society, that the\r\nsons of knights and gentlemen were sent at an early age to serve in\r\nother gentlemen’s houses. Thus John Paston the youngest was sent to be\r\nbrought up in the family of the Duke of Norfolk; and so common was this\r\npractice, so necessary was it esteemed to a young gentleman’s education,\r\nthat, as we have seen, his father was reproached for keeping his elder\r\nbrother at home and unemployed. In a new household, and especially in\r\nthat of a man of rank, it was considered that a youth would learn\r\nsomething of the world, and fit himself best for the place he was to\r\nfill in it. It was the same also, to some extent, with the daughters of\r\na family, as we find Margaret Paston writing to her son Sir John to get\r\nhis sister placed in the household either of the Countess of Oxford or\r\nof the Duchess of Bedford, or else ‘in some other worshipful\r\nplace.’[324-1] This we have supposed to be his sister Margery, who (no\r\ndoubt for want of being thus taken care of) shortly after married\r\nRichard Calle, to the scandal and disgust of the whole family. His other\r\nsister, Anne, was placed in the household of a gentleman named\r\nCalthorpe, who, however, afterwards desired to get rid of her, alleging\r\nthat he wished to reduce his household, and suggested that she ‘waxed\r\nhigh, and it were time to purvey her a marriage.’ It is curious that the\r\nprospect of her being sent home again does not seem to have been\r\nparticularly agreeable even to her own mother. Margaret Paston wonders\r\nwhy Calthorpe should have been so anxious to get rid of the young lady\r\nwithout delay. Perhaps she had given him offence, or committed some\r\nmisdemeanour. Her mother therefore writes to her son John the youngest\r\nin London to see how Cousin Clere ‘is disposed to her-ward,’ that she\r\nmay not be under the necessity of having her home again, where she would\r\nonly lose her time, and be continually trying her mother’s patience, as\r\nher sister Margery had done before her.[324-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 324-1: No. 704.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 324-2: No. 766.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Want of domestic feeling.] And was this, the reader may well\r\nask, the spirit of domestic life in the fifteenth century? Could two\r\ngenerations of one family not ordinarily live together in comfort? Was\r\nthe feeling of older people towards children only that they ought to be\r\ntaught the ways of the world, and learn not to make themselves\r\ndisagreeable? Alas! I fear, for the most part it amounted to little more\r\nthan this. Children, and especially daughters, were a mere burden to\r\ntheir parents. They must be sent away from home to learn manners, and to\r\nbe out of the way. As soon as they grew up, efforts must be made to\r\nmarry them, and get them off their parents’ hands for good. If they\r\ncould not be got rid of that way, and were still troublesome, they could\r\nbe well thrashed, like Elizabeth Paston, the aunt of the last-mentioned\r\nyoung ladies, who, as will be remembered, was allowed to speak to no\r\none, was beaten once or twice a week, and sometimes twice in one day,\r\nand had her head broken ‘in two or three places’ in consequence.[325-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 325-1: No. 94, and p. 155 of this Introduction.]\r\n\r\nSuch a state of matters, however repulsive to our feelings, is by no\r\nmeans unaccountable. That age was certainly not singular, however much\r\nmistaken, in its belief that a sense of what is due to the State is more\r\nimportant than a sense of what is due to the family. Our ancestors\r\nforgot the fact--as we too, in this age of enforced schooling are too\r\napt to leave it out of account--that the most important part of\r\neducation, good or bad, must inevitably be that which a child receives\r\nat home. They were rewarded for their forgetfulness by a loss of natural\r\naffection, for which their high sense of external order afforded but\r\nimperfect compensation. Admirable as the feudal system was in\r\nmaintaining the necessary subordination of different classes, it acted\r\nmost injuriously upon the homes, where all that makes up a nation’s real\r\nworth must be carefully tended in the first instance. [Sidenote:\r\nWardships.] The very foundation of domestic life was in many cases\r\nvitiated by a system which put the wardship and marriage of heirs under\r\nage at the disposal of their superior lords. In the case of an important\r\nlandowner who held of the Crown, it was a regular matter of bargain and\r\nsale. The wardship and marriage were granted away to such a person as\r\ncould offer the Treasury a satisfactory sum for the privilege; and if\r\nthe heir took it upon himself to marry without licence of such person,\r\nhe incurred a heavy fine.[325-2] Thus was the most sacred of all human\r\nrelations made a matter of traffic and sale, and the best feelings of\r\nthe human heart were systematically crushed by considerations the most\r\nsordid.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 325-2: We have already referred, at p. 154, to the case\r\n    of Stephen Scrope, whose wardship was sold by his stepfather, Sir\r\n    John Fastolf, to Judge Gascoigne, but was afterwards bought back\r\n    again to prevent the judge marrying him to one of his own\r\n    daughters, both the original sale and the redemption being equally\r\n    against the will of Stephen Scrope himself, who complained that\r\n    Fastolf had ‘bought and sold him like a beast.’ The particulars of\r\n    these transactions are not obtained from the Paston Letters, but\r\n    there will be found several notices of another wardship, viz. that\r\n    of Thomas Fastolf of Cowhaw, kinsman of Sir John Fastolf, which\r\n    was bought by Sir John of the king, and committed by patent to\r\n    John Paston and Sir Thomas Howes, and which became the subject of\r\n    a good deal of controversy.--_See_ Nos. 248, 263, 266, 267, 271,\r\n    292, and 352.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Remarks of a Venetian on the English.] The absence of\r\ndomestic affection among the English people generally was, in fact,\r\na subject of observation to foreigners in that day. The earliest extant\r\nreport of a Venetian ambassador on the state of this country was written\r\nin the reign of Henry VII., and in this we find some very strong\r\ncomments on the subject, showing that the cold-heartedness of parents\r\ntowards their children, the want of tenderness in husbands towards their\r\nwives, the mercenary way in which marriages were contracted by parents\r\nor guardians for the young people under their charge, was such as to\r\nshock the sensibility of strangers from the warmer lands of the South.\r\nTo the Italian mind it seemed as if there was no real human nature in\r\nEnglishmen at all. There was licentiousness among them, to be sure, but\r\nour Venetian almost doubted whether in high or low society an Englishman\r\nwas ever known to be in love. He had witnessed nothing of the sort\r\nhimself. On the contrary, he had seen young noblemen content to marry\r\nold widows for the sake of fortunes, which they hoped to share soon with\r\nyounger partners; and he suspected that although Englishmen were very\r\njealous husbands, the most serious offences against married life might\r\nbe condoned for money.[326-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 326-1: _Italian Relation of England_ (Camden Soc.), pp.\r\n    24-27.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Freedom of manners.] It is impossible to deny that these\r\ncomments, except the last, which we would fain hope was a mistake, must\r\nhave been largely justified. The Paston letters bear strong additional\r\ntestimony to the general truth of what our Italian critic saw in\r\nEngland. Yet, acute as his observation was, an ambassador from the\r\nstately Signory of Venice was perhaps not altogether in a position to\r\nread the deepest mysteries of the English heart. To this day the warmth\r\nof the English nature lies covered by a cold exterior; yet even in the\r\nexternal manners of the people the genial Erasmus found touches which\r\nour Venetian cared not for, and did not deign to notice. While feudalism\r\nstill kept down the natural emotions, insisting on a high respect for\r\norder, there was a freedom in social intercourse, and in England more\r\nthan elsewhere, which has long ago been chilled among ourselves by the\r\nseverity of Puritanism. In his own amusing way Erasmus tells us how in\r\nthis delightful island ladies and gentlemen kissed each other freely\r\nwhenever they met, in the streets or in their houses. There were kisses\r\nwhen you came, and kisses when you went away--delicate, fragrant kisses\r\nthat would assuredly tempt a poet from abroad to stay in England all his\r\ndays.[327-1] So the witty Dutchman informed a friend in the unrestrained\r\nfreedom of epistolary correspondence. And we may believe that in most\r\ncases the severity of home was mitigated by a greater freedom of\r\ncommunication with the world outside. Only in cases of very severe\r\ndispleasure were the daughters of a family shut up for a time, like\r\nElizabeth Paston, and forbidden to speak to any one. For the most part,\r\nthey received the salutations of strangers, and conversed with them\r\nwithout reserve, as marriage was quite understood to be a thing which\r\ndepended entirely upon arrangements made by their parents.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 327-1: _Erasm. Epp._ lib. v. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Urbanity.] With all this, there was an urbanity of manners,\r\na courtesy of address, and a general external refinement, on which more\r\nrecent times have not improved. And in these things England was\r\npre-eminent. Our Venetian could not help noticing that the English were\r\na very polite people. Another Italian of that day, Polydore Vergil, has\r\nrecorded that in this respect they resembled his own countrymen. The\r\nhard schooling which they received at home, the after-training elsewhere\r\nin the houses of ‘worshipful’ persons, had taught them from their early\r\nyears to consider above all things what was due to others. In every\r\nrelation of life, in the freest social intercourse, the honour due to\r\nparents, to strangers, to noblemen, or to kings, was never for a moment\r\nforgotten. In the most familiar letters the son asks his father’s or\r\nmother’s blessing, and the wife addresses her husband as ‘right\r\nworshipful.’ When people talked to each other on the street, they did so\r\nwith heads uncovered. Even kings at the mention of other potentates’\r\nnames took off their hats with reverence.[328-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 328-1: _Italian Relation_, pp. 22-32; Polydore Vergil,\r\n    14-15. Henry VII., in conference with the Spanish ambassador, De\r\n    Puebla, always took off his hat when the names of Ferdinand and\r\n    Isabella were mentioned (Bergenroth’s _Spanish Calendar_, vol. i.\r\n    p. 10). I have also seen notices of the same custom elsewhere.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Importance of maintaining authority.] An age which, with all\r\nits many drawbacks, cultivated ideas such as these cannot be looked upon\r\nas despicable or barbarous. We could have wished to see something more\r\nof the element of love in families--something more of the easy rule of\r\nnatural affection occasionally superseding the hard notions of feudal or\r\nparental discipline. But the anxiety to uphold authority, to preserve\r\nhonour for whom it was due, to maintain social and political order in\r\nspite of influences which were conspicuously at work breaking it up\r\nbefore men’s eyes, was a true and wholesome feeling, to the strength of\r\nwhich we owe a debt unspeakable even in these days of progress. At no\r\ntime in England’s history was there a stronger feeling of the needful\r\nsubordination of the different parts of society to each other; but under\r\na king incapable of governing, this feeling bred a curse, and not a\r\nblessing. The great lords, who should have preserved order under the\r\nking, fell out among themselves, and in spite of the fervid loyalty of\r\nthe age, the greatest subject became a kingmaker.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Earl of Warwick’s household.] That civil war should have\r\nbroken out in a state of society like this need occasion no surprise.\r\nThe enormous retinues of feudal noblemen were in themselves sufficiently\r\ndangerous to the peace of the kingdom, and when the sense of feudal\r\nsubjection to one sovereign was impaired, the issue could not be\r\ndoubtful. At the table of the great Earl of Warwick, Stow informs us\r\nthat the flesh of six entire oxen was sometimes consumed in a single\r\nmeal. With the profuse hospitality of the Middle Ages, he entertained\r\nnot only all his regular dependants, but all chance comers who had any\r\nacquaintance in his household. Visitors were also allowed to carry off\r\njoints from his table, and the taverns in the neighbourhood of Warwick’s\r\ninn were actually full of his meat.[329-1] Such a nobleman had no\r\ndifficulty in obtaining friends to fight for him in the day of battle.\r\nHe maintained, in fact, what might be called a little standing army at\r\nall times, and if an emergency arose, doubtless many who had dined at\r\nhis table would flock to his standard, and take his wages.[329-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 329-1: Stow’s _Chronicle_, 421.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 329-2: _See_ No. 760.]\r\n\r\n  [[Footnote 329-2: _missing “2” added_]]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Tudor policy.] The causes which had produced the wars of\r\nthe Roses were carefully watched by the Tudor sovereigns, and one by one\r\nrooted out. Laws were passed against noblemen keeping large retinues,\r\nand were not suffered to remain a dead letter. The nobility of England\r\nlearned to stand in awe of the Crown in a way they never did before, and\r\nnever have done since. Every branch of the royal family, except the\r\nreigning dynasty, was on one pretext or another lopped away. Every\r\npowerful nobleman knew that just in proportion as he was great, it was\r\nnecessary for him to be circumspect. Under Henry VIII. and Elizabeth,\r\nbirth and rank counted for very little, and the peers became submissive\r\ninstruments, anxious, and indeed eager, to carry out the sovereign’s\r\nwill. In short, the unity of a divided nation was restored under a set\r\nof politic kings, who enforced the laws, kept down the nobility, and, in\r\nspite of their despotism, were generally loved by the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO PREFACE AND INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

Post vero\r\n  diversas communicaciones communicare petierunt deliberacionem;\r\n  matura deliberatione habita sic est deffinitum, quod introitus\r\n  factus erit per assensum totius communis congregacionis per\r\n  feoffatores ipsius Johannis Paston, quia bene suppositum est quod\r\n  tam certi Aldermanni quam Cives Communarii[340-1] Civitatis sint\r\n  cofeoffati cum ipso Johanne Paston; et sic per feoffatores dictum\r\n  mesuagium erit apertum sine fractura vel ad minus nomine ipsorum\r\n  feoffatorum vel feoffati unius.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 339-2: The house is supposed to have been in the parish\r\n    of St. Peter Hungate, but it is not certainly known.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 339-3: About this period the 24 Ward Constables were\r\n    associated in an Assembly with the 60 Common Councillors. This is\r\n    why they are mentioned here, not with any reference to ‘police’\r\n    action.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 340-1: Members of the Common Council.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 339-1: For this extract from the Assembly books of the\r\n    City of Norwich I am indebted to the Rev. William Hudson of\r\n    Eastbourne, who further adds the following particulars:--\r\n\r\n    The Mayor this year was Thomas Elys who is mentioned in the\r\n    Paston Letters (iv. 139) as a great supporter of the Duke of\r\n    Suffolk and opponent of Paston.\r\n\r\n    The Recorder apparently was John Damme, I suppose the same who\r\n    occurs so often as a friend of the Pastons.\r\n\r\n    What with this divergence of feeling and the difficulty of\r\n    satisfying Lord Scales as well as their own duty towards the\r\n    City the case was a delicate one and was rather ingeniously\r\n    dealt with.\r\n\r\n    There is no other reference to the matter in the Norwich\r\n    documents so far as I am aware.]\r\n\r\n  [[p. 225 = shortly after sidenote “John Paston imprisoned\r\n  a third time”_]]\r\n\r\n\r\nX. A CHRONOLOGICAL NOTE.\r\n\r\n  It is desirable here to correct an error in the text, which\r\n  unfortunately was discovered too late. Letters 1020-1022 are out of\r\n  their proper place. No. 1020 is certainly a letter of Elizabeth\r\n  Woodville, Edward IV.’s queen, not of her daughter Elizabeth, who\r\n  was Henry VII.’s. No. 1021 was placed after it as being about the\r\n  same time, which no doubt it was; and the fact that the Earl of\r\n  Oxford was out of favour for a considerable part of Edward IV.’s\r\n  reign made it appear as if both letters belonged to that of Henry\r\n  VII., to which they were accordingly relegated in previous editions.\r\n  But this Earl of Oxford was in favour under Edward IV. till the\r\n  restoration of Henry VI.; and No. 1022, a letter which only appeared\r\n  in the Supplement of the last edition of this work, was written by\r\n  John Daubeney, who was killed at the siege of Caister in 1469. The\r\n  reference to the Queen’s confinement, moreover, which was so\r\n  perplexing in the case of Elizabeth of York, fits exactly with the\r\n  August of 1467, in which month Elizabeth Woodville gave birth to a\r\n  daughter named Mary. This letter, therefore, was written on the 8th\r\n  August, which would be the ‘Saturday before St. Laurence’ day’ in\r\n  that year: and it must be noted that the footnotes on p. 107 are\r\n  entirely wrong. The Archbishop of York referred to in the letter was\r\n  George Nevill, and the Treasurer was Richard, Earl Rivers.\r\n\r\n  No. 1021 is perhaps before A.D. 1467, as Howard and Sir Gilbert\r\n  Debenham are believed to be intending ‘to set upon Coton,’ of which\r\n  apparently Sir Gilbert was in possession in April 1467 (see vol. iv.\r\n  No. 664, p. 274).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOLUME I\r\n\r\n\r\n  Printed by T. and A.
