AND CHARLES V.\r\n\r\nThe closer the study and the wider the contemplation a Frenchman bestows\r\nupon his country’s history, the deeper will be his feelings of patriotic\r\npride, dashed with a tinge of sadness.  France, in respect of her\r\nnational unity, is the most ancient amongst the states of Christian\r\nEurope.  During her long existence she has passed through very different\r\nregimens, the chaos of barbarism, the feudal system, absolute monarchy,\r\nconstitutional monarchy, and republicanism.  Under all these regimens she\r\nhas had no lack of greatness and glory, material power and intellectual\r\nlustre, moral virtues and the charms of social life.  Her barbarism had\r\nits Charlemagne; her feudal system St. Louis, Joan of Arc, and Bayard;\r\nher absolute monarchy Henry IV. and Louis XIV.  Of our own times we say\r\nnothing.  France has shone in war and in peace, through the sword and\r\nthrough the intellect: she has by turns conquered and beguiled,\r\nenlightened and troubled Europe; she has always offered to the foreigner\r\na spectacle or an abode full of the curious and the attractive, of noble\r\npleasures and of mundane amusements.  And still, after so many centuries\r\nof such a grand and brilliant career, France has not yet attained the end\r\nto which she ever aspired, to which all civilized communities aspire, and\r\nthat is, order in the midst of movement, security and liberty united and\r\nlasting.  She has had shortcomings which have prevented her from reaping\r\nthe full advantage of her merits; she has committed faults which have\r\ninvolved her in reverses.  Two things, essential to political prosperity\r\namongst communities of men, have hitherto been to seek in her;\r\npredominance of public spirit over the spirit of caste or of profession,\r\nand moderation and fixity in respect of national ambition both at home\r\nand abroad.  France has been a victim to the personal passions of her\r\nchiefs and to her own reckless changeability.\r\n\r\nWe are entering upon the history of a period and a reign during which\r\nthis intermixture of merits and demerits, of virtues and vices, of\r\nprogress and backsliding, was powerfully and attractively exhibited\r\namongst the French.  Francis I., his government and his times commence\r\nthe era of modern France, and bring clearly to view the causes of her\r\ngreatnesses and her weaknesses.\r\n\r\nFrancis I. had received from God all the gifts that can adorn a man: he\r\nwas handsome and tall and strong; his armor, preserved in the Louvre, is\r\nthat of a man six feet high; his eyes were brilliant and soft, his smile\r\nwas gracious, his manners were winning.  From his very childhood he\r\nshowed that he had wits, enterprise, skill, and boldness.  He was but\r\nseven years old when, “on the day of the conversion of St. Paul, January\r\n25, 1501, about two P. M., my king, my lord, my Caesar, and my son, was\r\nrun away with, near Amboise, by a hackney which had been given him by\r\nMarshal de Gye; and so great was the danger that those who were present\r\nthought it was all over; howbeit God, the protector of widowed women and\r\nthe defender of orphans, foreseeing things to come, was pleased not to\r\nforsake me, knowing that, if accident had so suddenly deprived me of my\r\nlove, I should have been too utter a wretch.”  Such is the account given\r\nof this little incident by his mother, Louise of Savoy, who was at that\r\ntime habitually kept, by Anne of Brittany’s jealousy, at a distance from\r\nParis and the court.  [_Journal de Louise de Savoie_ in the Petitot\r\ncollection of _Memoires sur l’Histoire de France,_ Series I.  t. xvi.\r\np. 390.]  Some years later the young prince, who had become an ardent\r\nhuntsman, took the fancy into his head one day to let loose in the\r\ncourtyard of the castle of Amboise a wild boar which he had just caught\r\nin the forest.  The animal came to a door, burst it open with a blow of\r\nhis snout, and walked up into the apartments.  Those who were there took\r\nto their heels; but Francis went after the boar, came up with him, killed\r\nhim with a swordthrust, and sent him rolling down the staircase into the\r\ncourtyard.  When, in 1513, Louis XII. sent for the young Duke of\r\nAngouleme and bade him go and defend Picardy against the English, Francis\r\nhad scarcely done anything beyond so employing his natural gifts as to\r\ndelight the little court of which he was the centre; an estimable trait,\r\nbut very insufficient for the government of a people.\r\n\r\nWhen, two years afterwards, on the 1st of January, 1515, he ascended the\r\nthrone before he had attained his one and twentieth year, it was a\r\nbrilliant and brave but spoiled child that became king.  He had been\r\nunder the governance of Artus Gouffier, Sire de Boisy, a nobleman of\r\nPoitou, who had exerted himself to make his royal pupil a loyal knight,\r\nwell trained in the moral code and all the graces of knighthood, but\r\nwithout drawing his attention to more serious studies or preparing him\r\nfor the task of government.  The young Francis d’Angouleme lived and was\r\nmoulded under the influence of two women, his mother, Louise of Savoy,\r\nand his eldest sister, Marguerite, who both of them loved and adored him\r\nwith passionate idolatry.  It has just been shown in what terms Louise of\r\nSavoy, in her daily collection of private memoranda, used to speak to\r\nherself of her son, “My king, my lord, my Caesar, and my son!”  She was\r\nproud, ambitious, audacious, or pliant at need, able and steadfast in\r\nmind, violent and dissolute in her habits, greedy of pleasure and of\r\nmoney as well as of power, so that she gave her son neither moral\r\nprinciples nor a moral example: for him the supreme kingship, for herself\r\nthe rank, influence, and wealth of a queen-mother, and, for both,\r\ngreatness that might subserve the gratification of their passions--this\r\nwas all her dream and all her aim as a mother.  Of quite another sort\r\nwere the character and sentiments of Marguerite de Valois.  She was born\r\non the 11th of April, 1492, and was, therefore, only two years older than\r\nher brother Francis; but her more delicate nature was sooner and more\r\nrichly cultivated and developed.  She was brought up with strictness by\r\na most excellent and most venerable dame, in whom all the virtues, at\r\nrivalry one with another, existed together.  [Madame de Chatillon, whose\r\ndeceased husband had been governor to King Charles VIII.]  As she was\r\ndiscovered to have rare intellectual gifts and a very keen relish for\r\nlearning, she was provided with every kind of preceptors, who made her\r\nproficient in profane letters, as they were then called.  Marguerite\r\nlearned Latin, Greek, philosophy, and especially theology.  “At fifteen\r\nyears of age,” says a contemporary, “the spirit of God began to manifest\r\nitself in her eyes, in her face, in her walk, in her speech, and.\r\ngenerally in all her actions.”  “She had a heart,” says Brantome,\r\n“mighty devoted to God, and she loved mightily to compose spiritual\r\nsongs.  .  .  .  She also devoted herself to letters in her young days,\r\nand continued them as long as she lived, loving and conversing with, in\r\nthe time of her greatness, the most learned folks of her brother’s\r\nkingdom, who honored her so that they called her their Maecenas.”\r\n Learning, however, was far from absorbing the whole of this young soul.\r\n“She,” says a contemporary, “had an agreeable voice of touching tone,\r\nwhich roused the tender inclinations that there are in the heart.”\r\n Tenderness, a passionate tenderness, very early assumed the chief place\r\nin Marguerite’s soul, and the first object of it was her brother Francis.\r\nWhen mother, son, and sister were spoken of, they were called a Trinity,\r\nand to this Marguerite herself bore witness when she said, with charming\r\nmodesty,--\r\n\r\n               “Such boon is mine, to feel the amity\r\n               That God hath putten in our trinity,\r\n               Wherein to make a third, I, all unfitted\r\n               To be that number’s shadow, am admitted.”\r\n\r\nMarguerite it was for whom this close communion of three persons had the\r\nmost dolorous consequences: we shall fall in with her more than once in\r\nthe course of this history; but, whether or no, she was assuredly the\r\nbest of this princely trio, and Francis I.  was the most spoiled by it.\r\nThere is nothing more demoralizing than to be an idol.\r\n\r\nThe first acts of his government were sensible and of good omen.  He\r\nconfirmed or renewed the treaties or truces which Louis XII., at the\r\nclose of his reign, had concluded with the Venetians, the Swiss, the\r\npope, the King of England, the Archduke Charles, and the Emperor\r\nMaximilian, in order to restore peace to his kingdom.  At home Francis I.\r\nmaintained at his council the principal and most tried servants of his\r\npredecessor, amongst others the finance-minister, Florimond Robertet; and\r\nhe raised to four the number of the marshals of France, in order to\r\nconfer that dignity on Bayard’s valiant friend, James of Chabannes, Lord\r\nof La Palice, who even under Louis XII. had been entitled by the\r\nSpaniards “the great marshal of France.”  At the same time he exalted to\r\nthe highest offices in the state two new men, Charles, Duke of Bourbon,\r\nwho was still a mere youth, but already a warrior of renown, and Anthony\r\nDuprat, the able premier president of the Parliament of Paris; the former\r\nhe made constable, and the latter chancellor of France.  His mother,\r\nLouise of Savoy, was not unconcerned, it is said, in both promotions;\r\nshe was supposed to feel for the young constable something more than\r\nfriendship, and she regarded the veteran magistrate, not without reason,\r\nas the man most calculated to unreservedly subserve the interests of the\r\nkingly power and her own.\r\n\r\nThese measures, together with the language and the behavior of Francis\r\nI., and the care he took to conciliate all who approached him, made a\r\nfavorable impression on France and on Europe.  In Italy, especially,\r\nprinces as well as people, and Pope Leo X. before all, flattered\r\nthemselves, or were pleased to appear as if they flattered themselves,\r\nthat war would not come near them again, and that the young king had his\r\nheart set only on making Burgundy secure against sudden and outrageous\r\nattacks from the Swiss.  The aged King of Spain, Ferdinand the Catholic,\r\nadopting the views of his able minister, Cardinal Ximenes, alone showed\r\ndistrust and anxiety.  “Go not to sleep,” said he to his former allies;\r\n“a single instant is enough to bring the French in the wake of their\r\nmaster whithersoever he pleases to lead them; is it merely to defend\r\nBurgundy that the King of France is adding fifteen hundred lances to his\r\nmen-at-arms, and that a huge train of artillery is defiling into\r\nLyonness, and little by little approaching the mountains?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cardinal Ximenes----14]\r\n\r\nFerdinand urged the pope, the Emperor Maximilian, the Swiss, and\r\nMaximilian Sforza, Duke of Milan, to form a league for the defence of\r\nItaly; but Leo X.  persisted in his desire of remaining or appearing\r\nneutral, as the common father of the faithful.  Meanwhile the French\r\nambassador at Rome, William Bude, “a man,” says Guicciardini, “of\r\nprobably unique erudition amongst the men of our day,” and, besides, a\r\nman of keen and sagacious intellect, was unfolding the secret working of\r\nItalian diplomacy, and sending to Paris demands for his recall, saying,\r\n“Withdraw me from this court full of falsehoods; this is a residence too\r\nmuch out of my element.”  The answer was, that he should have patience,\r\nand still negotiate; for France, meeting ruse by ruse, was willing to be\r\nconsidered hoodwinked, whilst the eyes of the pope, diverted by a hollow\r\nnegotiation, were prevented from seeing the peril which was gathering\r\nround the Italian league and its declared or secret champions.\r\n[Gaillard, _Histoire de Francois 1er,_ t. i.  p. 208.]\r\n\r\nNeither the king nor the pope had for long to take the trouble of\r\npractising mutual deception.  It was announced at Rome that Francis I.,\r\nhaving arrived at Lyons in July, 1515, had just committed to his mother,\r\nLouise, the regency of the kingdom, and was pushing forward towards the\r\nAlps an army of sixty thousand men and a powerful artillery.  He had won\r\nover to his service Octavian Fregoso, Doge of Genoa; and Barthelemy\r\nd’Alviano, the veteran general of his allies the Venetians, was encamped\r\nwith his troops within hail of Verona, ready to support the French in the\r\nstruggle he foresaw.  Francis I., on his side, was informed that twenty\r\nthousand Swiss, commanded by the Roman, Prosper Colonna, were guarding\r\nthe passes of the Alps in order to shut him out from Milaness.  At the\r\nsame time he received the news that the Cardinal of Sion, his most\r\nzealous enemy in connection with the Roman Church, was devotedly\r\nemploying, with the secret support of the Emperor Maximilian, his\r\ninfluence and his preaching for the purpose of raising in Switzerland\r\na second army of from twenty to five and twenty thousand men, to be\r\nlaunched against him, if necessary, in Italy.  A Spanish and Roman army,\r\nunder the orders of Don Raymond of Cardone, rested motionless at some\r\ndistance from the Po, waiting for events and for orders prescribing the\r\npart they were to take.  It was clear that Francis I., though he had been\r\nbut six months king, was resolved and impatient to resume in Italy, and\r\nfirst of all in Milaness, the war of invasion and conquest which had been\r\nengaged in by Charles VIII.  and Louis XII.; and the league of all the\r\nstates of Italy save Venice and Genoa, with the pope for their\r\nhalf-hearted patron, and the Swiss for their fighting men, were\r\ncollecting their forces to repel the invader.\r\n\r\nIt was the month of August; the snow was diminishing and melting away\r\namong the Alps; and the king, with the main body of the army, joined at\r\nEmbrun the Constable de Bourbon, who commanded the advance-guard.  But\r\nthe two passes of Mount Cenis and Mount Ginevra were strongly guarded by\r\nthe Swiss, and others were sought for a little more to the south.  A\r\nshepherd, a chamois-hunter, pointed out one whereby, he said, the\r\nmountains might be crossed, and a descent made upon the plains of the\r\nmarquisate of Saluzzo.  The young constable went in person to examine the\r\nspots pointed out by the shepherd; and, the statement having been\r\nverified, it did not seem impossible to get the whole army over, even the\r\nheavy artillery; and they essayed this unknown road.  At several points,\r\nabysses had to be filled up, temporary bridges built, and enormous rocks\r\npierced; the men-at-arms marched on foot, with great difficulty dragging\r\ntheir horses; with still greater difficulty the infantry hauled the\r\ncannon over holes incompletely stopped and fragments of yawning rock.\r\nCaptains and soldiers set to work together; no labor seems too hard to\r\neager hope; and in five days the mountain was overcome, and the army\r\ncaught sight of the plain where the enemy might be encountered.  A small\r\nbody of four hundred men-at-arms, led by Marshal de Chabannes, were the\r\nfirst to descend into it; and among them was Bayard.  “Marshal,” said he\r\nto Chabannes, “we are told that over the Po yonder is Sir Prosper Colonna,\r\nwith two thousand horse, in a town called Villafranca, apprehending\r\nnought and thinking of nought but gaudies.  We must wake up his wits a\r\nlittle, and this moment get into the saddle with all our troops, that he\r\nbe not warned by any.”  “Sir Bayard,” said the marshal, “it is right well\r\nsaid; but how shall we cross the River Po, which is so impetuous and\r\nbroad?”  “Sir,” said Bayard, “here is my Lord de Morette’s brother, who\r\nknows the ford; he shall cross first, and I after him.”  So they mounted\r\ntheir horses, crossed the Po, and “were soon there, where Sir Prosper\r\nColonna was at table and was dining, as likewise were all his folk.”\r\n Bayard, who marched first, found the archers on guard in front of the\r\nItalian leader’s quarters.  “Yield you and utter no sound,” cried he,\r\n“else you are dead men.”  Some set about defending themselves; the rest\r\nran to warn Colonna, saying, “Up, sir; for, here are the French in a\r\ngreat troop already at this door.”  “Lads,” said Colonna to them, “keep\r\nthis door a little till we get some armor on to defend ourselves.”  But\r\nwhilst the fight was going on at the door Bayard had the windows scaled,\r\nand, entering first, cried out, “Where are you, Sir Prosper?  Yield you;\r\nelse you are a dead man.”  “Sir Frenchman, who is your captain?”  asked\r\nColonna.  “I am, sir.”  “Your name, captain?”  “Sir, I am one Bayard of\r\nFrance, and here are the Lord of La Palice, and the Lords d’Aubigny and\r\nd’Himbercourt, the flower of the captains of France.”  Colonna\r\nsurrendered, cursing Fortune, “the mother of all sorrow and affliction,\r\nwho had taken away his wits, and because he had not been warned of their\r\ncoming, for he would at least have made his capture a dear one;” and he\r\nadded, “It seems a thing divinely done; four noble knights at once, with\r\ntheir comrades at their backs, to take one Roman noble!”\r\n\r\nFrancis I. and the main body of his army had also arrived at the eastern\r\nfoot of the Alps, and were advancing into the plains of the country of\r\nSaluzzo and Piedmont.  The Swiss, dumbfounded at so unexpected an\r\napparition, fell back to Novara, the scene of that victory which two\r\nyears previously had made them so proud.  A rumor spread that negotiation\r\nwas possible, and that the question of Milaness might be settled without\r\nfighting.  The majority of the French captains repudiated the idea, but\r\nthe king entertained it.  His first impulses were sympathetic and\r\ngenerous.  “I would not purchase,” said he to Marshal de Lautrec, “with\r\nthe blood of my subjects, or even with that of my enemies, what I can pay\r\nfor with money.”  Parleys were commenced; and an agreement was hit upon\r\nwith conditions on which the Swiss would withdraw from Italy and resume\r\nalliance with the French.  A sum of seven hundred thousand crowns, it was\r\nsaid, was the chief condition; and the king and the captains of his army\r\ngave all they had, even to their plate, for the first instalment which\r\nLautrec was ordered to convey to Bufalora, where the Swiss were to\r\nreceive it.  But it was suddenly announced that the second army of twenty\r\nthousand Swiss, which the Cardinal of Sion had succeeded in raising, had\r\nentered Italy by the valley of the Ticino.  They formed a junction with\r\ntheir countrymen; the cardinal recommenced his zealous preaching against\r\nthe French; the newcomers rejected the stipulated arrangements; and,\r\nconfident in their united strength, all the Swiss made common accord.\r\nLautrec, warned in time, took with all speed his way back to the French\r\narmy, carrying away with him the money he had been charged to pay over;\r\nthe Venetian general, D’Alviano, went to the French camp to concert with\r\nthe king measures for the movements of his troops; and on both sides\r\nnothing was thought of but the delivery of a battle.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of September, 1515, about midday, the Constable de Bourbon\r\ngave notice to the king, encamped at Melegnano (a town about three\r\nleagues from Milan), that the Swiss, sallying in large masses from Milan,\r\nat the noisy summons of the bull of Uri and the cow of Unterwalden, were\r\nadvancing to attack.  “The king, who was purposing to sit down to supper,\r\nleft it on the spot, and went off straight towards the enemy, who were\r\nalready engaged in skirmishing, which lasted a long while before they\r\nwere at the great game.  The king had great numbers of lanzknechts, the\r\nwhich would fain have done a bold deed in crossing a ditch to go after\r\nthe Swiss; but these latter let seven or eight ranks cross, and then\r\nthrust you them back in such sort that all that had crossed got hurled\r\ninto the ditch.  The said lanzknechts were mighty frightened; and but for\r\nthe aid of a troop of men-at-arms, amongst the which was the good knight\r\nBayard, who bore down right through the Swiss, there had been a sad\r\ndisaster there, for it was now night, and night knows no shame.  A band\r\nof Swiss came passing in front of the king, who charged them gallantly.\r\nThere was heavy fighting there and much danger to the king’s person, for\r\nhis great buffe [the top of the visor of his helmet] was pierced, so as\r\nto let in daylight, by the thrust of a pike.  It was now so late that\r\nthey could not see one another; and the Swiss were, for this evening,\r\nforced to retire on the one side, and the French on the other.  They\r\nlodged as they could; but well I trow that none did rest at ease.  The\r\nKing of France put as good a face on matters as the least of all his\r\nsoldiers did, for he remained all night a-horseback like the rest\r\n(according to other accounts he had a little sleep, lying on a\r\ngun-carriage).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: All Night a-horseback----19]\r\n\r\nOn the morrow at daybreak the Swiss were for beginning again, and they\r\ncame straight towards the French artillery, from which they had a good\r\npeppering.  Howbeit, never did men fight better, and the affair lasted\r\nthree or four good hours.  At last they were broken and beaten, and there\r\nwere left on the field ten or twelve thousand of them.  The remainder, in\r\npretty good order along a high road, withdrew to Milan, whither they were\r\npursued sword-in-hand.”  [_Histoire du bon Chevalier sans Peur et sans\r\nReproehe,_ t. ii.  pp. 99-102.]\r\n\r\nThe very day after the battle Francis I. wrote to his mother the regent a\r\nlong account, alternately ingenuous and eloquent, in which the details\r\nare set forth with all the complacency of a brave young man who is\r\nspeaking of the first great affair in which he has been engaged and in\r\nwhich he did himself honor.  The victory of Melegnano was the most\r\nbrilliant day in the annals of this reign.  Old Marshal Trivulzio, who\r\nhad taken part in seventeen battles, said that this was a strife of\r\ngiants, beside which all the rest were but child’s play.  On the very\r\nbattle-field, “before making and creating knights of those who had done\r\nhim good service, Francis I. was pleased to have himself made knight by\r\nthe hand of Bayard.  ‘Sir,’ said Bayard, ‘the king of so noble a realm,\r\nhe who has been crowned, consecrated and anointed with oil sent down from\r\nheaven, he who is the eldest son of the church, is knight over all other\r\nknights.’  ‘Bayard, my friend,’ said the king, ‘make haste; we must have\r\nno laws or canons quoted here; do my bidding.’  ‘Assuredly, sir,’ said\r\nBayard, ‘I will do it, since it is your pleasure;’ and, taking his sword,\r\n‘Avail it as much,’ said he, ‘as if I were Roland or Oliver, Godfrey or\r\nhis brother Baldwin; please God, sir, that in war you may never take\r\nflight!’ and, holding up his sword in the air, he cried, ‘Assuredly, my\r\ngood sword, thou shalt be well guarded as a relic and honored above all\r\nothers for having this day conferred upon so handsome and puissant a king\r\nthe order of chivalry; and never will I wear thee more if it be not\r\nagainst Turks, Moors, and Saracens!’  Whereupon he gave two bounds and\r\nthrust his sword into the sheath.”  [_Les testes et la Vie du Chevalier\r\nBayard, by Champier,_ in the _Archives curieuses de l’Histoire de\r\nFrance,_ Series I.  t. ii.  p. 160.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bayard Knighting Francis I----19]\r\n\r\nThe effect of the victory of Melegnano was great, in Italy primarily, but\r\nalso throughout Europe.  It was, at the commencement of a new reign and\r\nunder the impulse communicated by a young king, an event which seemed to\r\nbe decisive and likely to remain so for a long while.  Of all the\r\nsovereigns engaged in the Italian league against Francis I., he who was\r\nmost anxious to appear temperate and almost neutral, namely, Leo X., was\r\nprecisely he who was most surprised and most troubled by it.  When he\r\nknew that a battle was on the eve of being fought between the French and\r\nthe Swiss, he could not conceal his anxiety and his desire that the Swiss\r\nmight be victorious.  The Venetian ambassador at Rome, Marino Giorgi,\r\nwhose feelings were quite the other way, took, in his diplomatic\r\ncapacity, a malicious pleasure in disquieting him.  “Holy father,” said\r\nhe, “the Most Christian King is there in person with the most warlike and\r\nbest appointed of armies; the Swiss are afoot and ill armed, and I am\r\ndoubtful of their gaining the day.”  “But the Swiss are valiant soldiers,\r\nare they not?” said the pope.  “Were it not better, holy father,”\r\n rejoined the ambassador, “that they should show their valor against the\r\ninfidel?”  When the news of the battle arrived, the ambassador, in grand\r\narray, repaired to the pope’s; and the people who saw him passing by in\r\nsuch state said, “The news is certainly true.”  On reaching the pope’s\r\napartment the ambassador met the chamberlain, who told him that the holy\r\nfather was still asleep.  “Wake him,” said he; but the other refused.\r\n“Do as I tell you,” insisted the ambassador.  The chamberlain went in;\r\nand the pope, only half dressed, soon sallied from his room.  “Holy\r\nfather,” said the Venetian, “your Holiness yesterday gave me some bad\r\nnews which was false; to-day I have to give you some good news which is\r\ntrue: the Swiss are beaten.”  The pope read the letters brought by the\r\nambassador, and some other letters also.  “What will come of it for us\r\nand for you?” asked the pope.  “For us,” was the answer, “nothing but\r\ngood, since we are with the Most Christian king; and your Holiness will\r\nnot have aught of evil to suffer.”  “Sir Ambassador,” rejoined the pope,\r\n“we will see what the Most Christian king will do; we will place\r\nourselves in his hands, demanding mercy of him.”  “Holy father, your\r\nHoliness will not come to the least harm, any more than the holy See: is\r\nnot the Most Christian king the church’s own son?”  And in the account\r\ngiven of this interview to the Senate of Venice the ambassador added,\r\n“The holy father is a good sort of man, a man of great liberality and of\r\na happy disposition; but he would not like the idea of having to give\r\nhimself much trouble.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Leo X.----21]\r\n\r\nLeo X. made up his mind without much trouble to accept accomplished\r\nfacts.  When he had been elected pope, he had said to his brother, Julian\r\nde’ Medici, “Enjoy we the papacy, since God hath given it us” [_Godiamoci\r\nil papato, poiche Dio ci l’ ha dato_].  He appeared to have no further\r\nthought than how to pluck from the event the advantages he could discover\r\nin it.  His allies all set him an example of resignation.  On the 15th of\r\nSeptember, the day after the battle, the Swiss took the road back to\r\ntheir mountains.  Francis I. entered Milan in triumph.  Maximilian Sforza\r\ntook refuge in the castle, and twenty days afterwards, on the 4th of\r\nOctober, surrendered, consenting to retire to France with a pension of\r\nthirty thousand crowns, and the promise of being recommended for a\r\ncardinal’s hat, and almost consoled for his downfall “by the pleasure of\r\nbeing delivered from the insolence of the Swiss, the exactions of the\r\nEmperor Maximilian, and the rascalities of the Spaniards.”  Fifteen years\r\nafterwards, in June, 1530, he died in oblivion at Paris.  Francis I.\r\nregained possession of all Milaness, adding thereto, with the pope’s\r\nconsent, the duchies of Parma and Piacenza, which had been detached from\r\nit in 1512.  Two treaties, one of November 7, 1515, and the other of\r\nNovember 29, 1516, re-established not only peace, but perpetual alliance,\r\nbetween the King of France and the thirteen Swiss cantons, with\r\nstipulated conditions in detail.  Whilst these negotiations were in\r\nprogress, Francis I. and Leo X., by a treaty published at Viterbo on the\r\n13th of October, proclaimed their hearty reconciliation.  The pope\r\nguaranteed to Francis I. the duchy of Milan, restored to him those of\r\nParma and Piacenza, and recalled his troops which were still serving\r\nagainst the Venetians; being careful, however, to cover his concessions\r\nby means of forms and pretexts which gave them the character of a\r\nnecessity submitted to rather than that of an independent and definite\r\nengagement.  Francis I., on his side, guaranteed to the pope all the\r\npossessions of the church, renounced the patronage of the petty princes\r\nof the ecclesiastical estate, and promised to uphold the family of the\r\nMedici in the position it had held at Florence since, with the King of\r\nSpain’s aid, in 1512, it had recovered the dominion there at the expense\r\nof the party of republicans and friends of France.\r\n\r\nThe King of France and the pope had to discuss together questions far\r\nmore important on both sides than those which had just been thus settled\r\nby their accredited agents.  When they signed the treaty of Viterbo, it\r\nwas agreed that the two sovereigns should have a personal interview, at\r\nwhich they should come to an arrangement upon points of which they had as\r\nyet said nothing.  Rome seemed the place most naturally adapted for this\r\ninterview; but the pope did not wish that Francis I. should go and\r\ndisplay his triumph there.  Besides, he foresaw that the king would speak\r\nto him about the kingdom of Naples, the conquest of which was evidently\r\npremeditated by the king; and when Francis I., having arrived at Rome,\r\nhad already done half the journey, Leo X. feared that it would be more\r\ndifficult to divert him.  He resolved to make to the king a show of\r\ndeference to conceal his own disquietude; and offered to go and meet him\r\nat Bologna, the town in the Roman States which was nearest to Milaness.\r\nFrancis accepted the offer.  The pope arrived at Bologna on the 8th of\r\nDecember, 1515, and the king the next day.  After the public ceremonies,\r\nat which the king showed eagerness to tender to the pope acts of homage\r\nwhich the pope was equally eager to curtail without repelling them, the\r\ntwo sovereigns conversed about the two questions which were uppermost in\r\ntheir minds.  Francis did not attempt to hide his design of reconquering\r\nthe kingdom of Naples, which Ferdinand the Catholic had wrongfully\r\nusurped, and he demanded the pope’s countenance.  The pope did not care\r\nto refuse, but he pointed out to the king that everything foretold the\r\nvery near death of King Ferdinand; and “Your majesty,” said he, “will\r\nthen have a natural opportunity for claiming your rights; and as for me,\r\nfree, as I shall then be, from my engagements with the King of Arragon in\r\nrespect of the crown of Naples, I shall find it easier to respond to your\r\nmajesty’s wish.”  The pope merely wanted to gain time.  Francis, setting\r\naside for the moment the kingdom of Naples, spoke of Charles VII.’s\r\nPragmatic Sanction, and the necessity of putting an end to the\r\ndifficulties which had arisen on this subject between the court of Rome\r\nand the Kings of France, his predecessors.  “As to that,” said the pope,\r\n“I could not grant what your predecessors demanded; but be not uneasy;\r\nI have a compensation to propose to you which will prove to you how dear\r\nyour interests are to me.”  The two sovereigns had, without doubt,\r\nalready come to an understanding on this point, when, after a three days’\r\ninterview with Leo X., Francis I. returned to Milan, leaving at Bologna,\r\nfor the purpose of treating in detail the affair of the Pragmatic\r\nSanction, his chancellor, Duprat, who had accompanied him during all this\r\ncampaign as his adviser and negotiator.\r\n\r\nIn him the king had, under the name and guise of premier magistrate of\r\nthe realm, a servant whose bold and complacent abilities he was not slow\r\nto recognize and to put in use.  Being irritated “for that many, not\r\nhaving the privilege of sportsmen, do take beasts, both red and black, as\r\nhares, pheasants, partridges, and other game, thus frustrating us of our\r\ndiversion and pastime that we take in the chase,” Francis I. issued, in\r\nMarch, 1516, an ordinance which decreed against poachers the most severe\r\npenalties, and even death, and which “granted to all princes, lords, and\r\ngentlemen possessing forests or warrens in the realm, the right of\r\nupholding therein by equally severe punishments the exclusive privileges\r\nof their preserves.”  The Parliament made remonstrances against such\r\nexcessive rigor, and refused to register the ordinance.  The chancellor,\r\nDuprat, insisted, and even threatened.  “To the king alone,” said he,\r\n“belongs the right of regulating the administration of his state obey, or\r\nthe king will see in you only rebels, whom he will know how to chastise.”\r\n For a year the Parliament held out; but the chancellor persisted more\r\nobstinately in having his way, and, on the 11th of February, 1517, the\r\nordinance was registered under a formal order from the king, to which the\r\nname was given of “letters of command.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Anthony Duprat----24]\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the war for the conquest of Milaness there was a\r\nwant of money, and Francis I.  hesitated to so soon impose new taxes.\r\nDuprat gave a scandalous extension to a practice which had been for a\r\nlong while in use, but had always been reprobated and sometimes formally\r\nprohibited, namely, the sale of public appointments or offices: not only\r\ndid he create a multitude of financial and administrative offices, the\r\nsale of which brought considerable sums into the treasury, but he\r\nintroduced the abuse into the very heart of the judicial body; the\r\ntribunals were encumbered by newly-created magistrates.  The estates of\r\nLanguedoc complained in vain.  The Parliament of Paris was in its turn\r\nattacked.  In 1521, three councillors, recently nominated, were convicted\r\nof having paid, one three thousand eight hundred livres, and the two\r\nothers six thousand livres.  The Parliament refused to admit them.\r\nDuprat protested.  The necessities of the state, he said, made borrowing\r\nobligatory; and the king was free to prefer in his selections those of\r\nhis subjects who showed most zeal for his service.  Parliament persisted\r\nin its refusal.  Duprat resolved to strike a great blow.  An edict of\r\nJanuary 31, 1522, created within the Parliament a fourth chamber,\r\ncomposed of eighteen councillors and two presidents, all of fresh, and,\r\nno doubt, venal appointment, though the edict dared not avow as much.\r\nTwo great personages, the Archbishop of Aix and Marshal de Montmorenci,\r\nwere charged to present the edict to Parliament and require its\r\nregistration.  The Parliament demanded time for deliberation.  It kept an\r\nabsolute silence for six weeks, and at last presented an address to the\r\nqueen-mother, trying to make her comprehend the harm such acts did to the\r\nimportance of the magistracy and to her son’s government.  Louise\r\nappeared touched by these representations, and promised to represent\r\ntheir full weight to the king, “if the Parliament will consent to point\r\nout to me of itself any other means of readily raising the sum of one\r\nhundred and twenty thousand livres, which the king absolutely cannot do\r\nwithout.”  The struggle was prolonged until the Parliament declared “that\r\nit could not, without offending God and betraying its own conscience,\r\nproceed to the registration; but that if it were the king’s pleasure to\r\nbe obeyed at any price, he had only to depute his chancellor or some\r\nother great personage, in whose presence and on whose requirement the\r\nregistration should take place.”  Chancellor Duprat did not care to\r\nundertake this commission in person.  Count de St. Pol, governor of\r\nParis, was charged with it, and the court caused to be written at the\r\nbottom of the letters of command, “Read and published in presence of\r\nCount de St. Pol, specially deputed for this purpose, who ordered viva\r\nvoce, in the king’s name, that they be executed.”\r\n\r\nThus began to be implanted in that which should be the most respected and\r\nthe most independent amongst the functions of government, namely, the\r\nadministration of justice, not only the practice, but the fundamental\r\nmaxim, of absolute government.  “I am going to the court, and I will\r\nspeak the truth; after which the king will have to be obeyed,” was said\r\nin the middle of the seventeenth century by the premier president Mold to\r\nCardinal de Retz.  Chancellor Duprat, if we are not mistaken, was, in the\r\nsixteenth century, the first chief of the French magistracy to make use\r\nof language despotic not only in fact, but also in principle.  President\r\nMole was but the head of a body invested, so far as the king was\r\nconcerned, with the right of remonstrance and resistance; when once that\r\nright was exercised, he might, without servility, give himself up to\r\nresignation.  Chancellor Duprat was the delegate, the organ, the\r\nrepresentative of the king; it was in the name of the king himself that\r\nhe affirmed the absolute power of the kingship and the absolute duty of\r\nsubmission.  Francis I. could not have committed the negotiation with Leo\r\nX. in respect of Charles VII.’s Pragmatic Sanction to a man with more\r\ninclination and better adapted for the work to be accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe Pragmatic Sanction had three principal objects:--\r\n\r\n     1.  To uphold the liberties and the influence of the faithful in the\r\n     government of the church, by sanctioning their right to elect\r\n     ministers of the Christian faith, especially parish priests and\r\n     bishops;\r\n\r\n     2.  To guarantee the liberties and rights of the church herself in\r\n     her relations with her head, the pope, by proclaiming the necessity\r\n     for the regular intervention of councils and their superiority in\r\n     regard to the pope;\r\n\r\n     3.  To prevent or reform abuses in the relations of the papacy with\r\n     the state and church of France in the matter of ecclesiastical\r\n     tribute, especially as to the receipt by the pope, under the name of\r\n     annates, of the first year’s revenue of the different ecclesiastical\r\n     offices and benefices.\r\n\r\nIn the fifteenth century it was the general opinion in France, in state\r\nand in church, that there was in these dispositions nothing more than the\r\nprimitive and traditional liberties and rights of the Christian church.\r\nThere was no thought of imposing upon the papacy any new regimen, but\r\nonly of defending the old and legitimate regimen, recognized and upheld\r\nby St. Louis in the thirteenth century as well as by Charles VII. in the\r\nfifteenth.\r\n\r\nThe popes, nevertheless, had all of them protested since the days of\r\nCharles VII. against the Pragmatic Sanction as an attack upon their\r\nrights, and had demanded its abolition.  In 1461, Louis XI., as has\r\nalready been shown, had yielded for a moment to the demand of Pope Pius\r\nII., whose countenance he desired to gain, and had abrogated the\r\nPragmatic; but, not having obtained what he wanted thereby, and having\r\nmet with strong opposition in the Parliament of Paris to his concession,\r\nhe had let it drop without formally retracting it, and, instead of\r\nengaging in a conflict with Parliament upon the point, he thought it no\r\nbad plan for the magistracy to uphold in principle and enforce in fact\r\nthe regulations of the Pragmatic Sanction.  This important edict, then,\r\nwas still vigorous in 1515, when Francis I., after his victory at\r\nMelegnano and his reconciliation with the pope, left Chancellor Duprat\r\nat Bologna to pursue the negotiation reopened on that subject.  The\r\ncompensation, of which Leo X., on redemanding the abolition of the\r\nPragmatic Sanction, had given a peep to Francis I., could not fail to\r\nhave charms for a prince so little scrupulous, and for his still less\r\nscrupulous chancellor.  The pope proposed that the Pragmatic, once for\r\nall abolished, should be replaced by a Concordat between the two\r\nsovereigns, and that this Concordat, whilst putting a stop to the\r\nelection of the clergy by the faithful, should transfer to the king the\r\nright of nomination to bishoprics and other great ecclesiastical offices\r\nand benefices, reserving to the pope the right of presentation of\r\nprelates nominated by the king.  This, considering the condition of\r\nsociety and government in the sixteenth century, in the absence of\r\npolitical and religious liberty, was to take away from the church her own\r\nexistence, and divide her between two masters, without giving her, as\r\nregarded either of them, any other guarantee of independence than the\r\nmere chance of their dissensions and quarrels.\r\n\r\nEgotism, even in kings, has often narrow and short-sighted views.  It was\r\ncalculated that there were in France at this period ten archbishoprics,\r\neighty-three bishoprics, and five hundred and twenty-seven abbeys.\r\nFrancis I. and his chancellor saw in the proposed Concordat nothing but\r\nthe great increment of influence it secured to them, by making all the\r\ndignitaries of the church suppliants at first and then clients of the\r\nkingship.  After some difficulties as to points of detail, the Concordat\r\nwas concluded and signed on the 18th of August, 1516.  Five months\r\nafterwards, on the 5th of February, 1517, the king repaired in person to\r\nParliament, to which he had summoned many prelates and doctors of the\r\nUniversity.  The chancellor explained the points of the Concordat, and\r\nrecapitulated all the facts which, according to him, had made it\r\nnecessary.  The king ordered its registration, “for the good of his\r\nkingdom and for quittance of the promise he had given the pope.”\r\n Parliament on one side, and the prelates and doctors of the University\r\non the other, deliberated upon this demand.  Their first answer was that,\r\nas the matter concerned the interest of the whole Gallican church, they\r\ncould not themselves decide about it, and that the church, assembled in\r\nnational council, alone had the right of pronouncing judgment.  “Oho! so\r\nyou cannot,” said the king; “I will soon let you see that you can, or I\r\nwill send you all to Rome to give the pope your reasons.”  To the\r\nquestion of conscience the Parliament found thenceforth added the\r\nquestion of dignity.  The magistrates raised difficulties in point of\r\nform, and asked for time to discuss the matter fundamentally; and\r\ndeputies went to carry their request to the king.  He admitted the\r\npropriety of delay, but with this comment: “I know that there are in my\r\nParliament good sort of men, wise men; but I also know that there are\r\nturbulent and rash fools; I have my eye upon them; and I am informed of\r\nthe language they dare to hold about my conduct.  I am king as my\r\npredecessors were; and I mean to be obeyed as they were.  You are\r\nconstantly vaporing to me about Louis XII. and his love of justice; know\r\nye that justice is as dear to me as it was to him; but that king, just as\r\nhe was, often drove out from the kingdom rebels, though they were members\r\nof Parliament; do not force me to imitate him in his severity.”\r\n Parliament entered upon a fundamental examination of the question; their\r\ndeliberations lasted from the 13th to the 24th of July, 1517; and the\r\nconclusion they came to was, that Parliament could not and ought not to\r\nregister the Concordat; that, if the king persisted in his intention of\r\nmaking it a law of the realm, he must employ the same means as Charles\r\nVII. had employed for establishing the Pragmatic Sanction, and that,\r\ntherefore, he must summon a general council.  On the 14th of January,\r\n1518, two councillors arrived at Amboise, bringing to the king the\r\nrepresentations of the Parliament.  When their arrival was announced to\r\nthe king, “Before I receive them,” said he, “I will drag them about at my\r\nheels as long as they have made me wait.”  He received them, however, and\r\nhanded their representations over to the chancellor, bidding him reply to\r\nthem.  Duprat made a learned and specious reply, but one which left\r\nintact the question of right, and, at bottom, merely defended the\r\nConcordat on the ground of the king’s good pleasure and requirements of\r\npolicy.  On the last day of February, 1518, the king gave audience to the\r\ndeputies, and handed them the chancellor’s reply.  They asked to examine\r\nit.  “You shall not examine it,” said the king; “this would degenerate\r\ninto an endless process.  A hundred of your heads, in Parliament, have\r\nbeen seven months and more painfully getting up these representations,\r\nwhich my chancellor has blown to the winds in a few days.  There is but\r\none king in France; I have done all I could to restore peace to my\r\nkingdom; and I will not allow nullification here of that which I brought\r\nabout with so much difficulty in Italy.  My Parliament would set up for a\r\nVenetian Senate; let it confine its meddling to the cause of justice,\r\nwhich is worse administered than it has been for a hundred years; I\r\nought, perhaps, to drag it about at my heels, like the Grand Council, and\r\nwatch more closely over its conduct.”  The two deputies made an attempt\r\nto prolong their stay at Amboise: but, “If before six to-morrow morning,”\r\n said the king, “they be not gone, I will send some archers to take them\r\nand cast them into a dungeon for six months; and woe to whoever dares to\r\nspeak to me for them!”\r\n\r\nOn returning to Paris the deputies were beginning to give their fellows\r\nan account of how harsh a reception they met with, when Louis de la\r\nTremoille, the most respected amongst the chiefs of the army, entered the\r\nhall.  He came by order of the king to affirm to the Parliament that to\r\ndismiss the Concordat was to renew the war, and that it must obey on the\r\ninstant or profess open rebellion.  Parliament upheld its decision of\r\nJuly 24, 1517, against the Concordat, at the same time begging La\r\nTremoille to write to the king to persuade him, if he insisted upon\r\nregistration, to send some person of note or to commission La Tremoille\r\nhimself to be present at the act, and to see indorsed upon the Concordat,\r\n“Read, published, and registered at the king’s most express command\r\nseveral times repeated, in presence of .  .  .  , specially deputed by\r\nhim for that purpose.”  Tremoille hesitated to write, and exhibited the\r\nletters whereby the king urged him to execute the strict orders laid upon\r\nhim.  “What are those orders, then?” asked the premier president.  “That\r\nis the king’s secret,” answered La Tremoille: “I may not reveal it; all\r\nthat I can tell you is, that I should never have peace of mind if you\r\nforced me to carry them out.”  The Parliament in its excitement begged La\r\nTremoille to withdraw, and sent for him back almost immediately.\r\n“Choose,” said the premier president to him, “between Saturday or Monday\r\nnext to be present at the registration.”  La Tremoille chose Monday,\r\nwishing to allow himself time for an answer even yet from the king.  But\r\nno new instructions came to him; and on the 22d of March, 1518,\r\nParliament proceeded to registration of the Concordat, with the forms and\r\nreservations which they had announced, and which were evidence of\r\ncompulsion.  The other Parliaments of France followed with more or less\r\nzeal, according to their own particular dispositions, the example shown\r\nby that of Paris.  The University was heartily disposed to push\r\nresistance farther than had been done by Parliament: its rector caused to\r\nbe placarded on the 27th of March, 1518, in the streets of Paris, an\r\norder forbidding all printers and booksellers to print the Concordat on\r\npain of losing their connection with the University.  The king commanded\r\ninformations to be filed against the authors and placarders of the order,\r\nand, on the 27th of April, sent to the Parliament an edict, which forbade\r\nthe University to meddle in any matter of public police, or to hold any\r\nassembly touching such matters, under pain, as to the whole body, of\r\nhaving its privileges revoked, and, as to individuals, of banishment and\r\nconfiscation.  The king’s party demanded of Parliament registration of\r\nthis edict.  Parliament confined itself to writing to the king, agreeing\r\nthat the University had no right to meddle in affairs of government, but\r\nadding that there were strong reasons, of which it would give an account\r\nwhenever the king should please to order, why it, the Parliament, should\r\nrefuse registration of the edict.  It does not appear that the king ever\r\nasked for such account, or that his wrath against the University was more\r\nobstinately manifested.  The Concordat was registered, and Francis I.,\r\nafter having achieved an official victory over the magistrates, had small\r\nstomach for pursuing extreme measures against the men of letters.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that in the course of the fifteenth century, there were made\r\nin France two able and patriotic attempts; the Pragmatic Sanction, in\r\n1458, under Charles VII., and the States General of 1484, under Charles\r\nVIII.  We do not care to discuss here all the dispositions of those acts;\r\nsome of them were, indeed, questionable; but they both of them, one in\r\nrespect of the church and the other of the state, aimed at causing France\r\nto make a great stride towards a national, free and legalized regimen, to\r\nwhich French feudal society had never known how or been willing to adjust\r\nitself.  These two attempts failed.  It would be unjust to lay the blame\r\non the contemporary governments.  Charles VII. was in earnest about the\r\nPragmatic Sanction which he submitted to the deliberations and votes of a\r\nnational council; and Louis XI., after having for a while given it up to\r\nthe pope, retraced his steps and left it in force.  As to the States\r\nGeneral of 1484, neither the regent, Anne de Beaujeu, nor Charles VIII.,\r\noffered the slightest hinderance to their deliberations and their votes;\r\nand if Louis XII. did not convoke the States afresh, he constantly strove\r\nin the government of his kingdom to render them homage and give them\r\nsatisfaction.  We may feel convinced that, considering the social and\r\nintellectual condition of France at this time, these two patriotic\r\nattempts were premature; but a good policy, being premature, is not on\r\nthat account alone condemned to failure; what it wants is time to get\r\nitself comprehended, appreciated, and practised gradually and\r\nconsistently.  If the successors of Louis XII.  had acted in the same\r\nspirit and with the same view as their predecessor, France would probably\r\nhave made progress in this salutary path.  But exactly the contrary took\r\nplace.  Instead of continuing a more and more free and legal regimen,\r\nFrancis I. and his chancellor, Duprat, loudly proclaimed and practised\r\nthe maxims of absolute power; in the church, the Pragmatic Sanction was\r\nabolished; and in the state, Francis I., during a reign of thirty-two\r\nyears, did not once convoke the States General, and labored only to set\r\nup the sovereign right of his own sole will.  The church was despoiled\r\nof her electoral autonomy; and the magistracy, treated with haughty and\r\nsilly impertinence, was vanquished and humiliated in the exercise of its\r\nright of remonstrance.  The Concordat of 1516 was not the only, but it\r\nwas the gravest pact of alliance concluded between the papacy and the\r\nFrench kingship for the promotion mutually of absolute power.\r\n\r\nWhilst this question formed the subject of disputes in France between the\r\ngreat public authorities, there was springing up, outside of France,\r\nbetween the great European powers another not more grave in regard to a\r\ndistant future, but more threatening in regard to the present peace of\r\nnations.  King Ferdinand the Catholic had died on the 23d of January,\r\n1516; and his grandson and successor, Archduke Charles, anxious to go and\r\ntake possession of the throne of Spain, had hastily concluded with\r\nFrancis I., on the 13th of August, 1516, at Noyon, a treaty intended to\r\nsettle differences between the two crowns as to the kingdoms of Naples\r\nand Navarre.  The French and Spanish plenipotentiaries, Sires de Boisy\r\nand de Chievres, were still holding meetings at Montpellier, trying to\r\ncome to an understanding about the execution of this treaty, when the\r\ndeath of Emperor Maximilian at Wels, in Austria, on the 12th of January,\r\n1519, occurred to add the vacant throne of a great power to the two\r\nsecond-rate thrones already in dispute between two powerful princes.\r\nThree claimants, Charles of Austria, who was the new King of Spain,\r\nFrancis I., and Henry VIII., King of England, aspired to this splendid\r\nheritage.  In 1517, Maximilian himself, in one of his fits of temper and\r\nimpecuniosity, had offered to abdicate and give up the imperial dignity\r\nto Henry VIII. for a good round sum; but the King of England’s envoy, Dr.\r\nCuthbert Tunstall, a stanch and clearsighted servant, who had been sent\r\nto Germany to deal with this singular proposal, opened his master’s eyes\r\nto its hollowness and falsehood, and Henry VIII. held himself aloof.\r\nFrancis I. remained the only rival of Charles of Austria; Maximilian\r\nlabored eagerly to pave the way for his grandson’s success; and at his\r\ndeath the struggle between the two claimants had already become so keen\r\nthat Francis I., on hearing the news, exclaimed, “I will spend three\r\nmillions to be elected emperor, and I swear that, three years after the\r\nelection, I will be either at Constantinople or dead.”\r\n\r\nThe Turks, who had been since 1453 settled at Constantinople, were the\r\nterror of Christian Europe; and Germany especially had need of a puissant\r\nand valiant defender against them.  Francis I. calculated that the\r\nChristians of Germany and Hungary would see in him, the King of France\r\nand the victor of Melegnano, their most imposing and most effectual\r\nchampion.\r\n\r\nHaving a superficial mind and being full of vain confidence, Francis I.\r\nwas mistaken about the forces and chances on his side, as well as about\r\nthe real and natural interests of France, and also his own.  There was no\r\ncall for him to compromise himself in this electoral struggle of kings,\r\nand in a distant war against triumphant Islamry.  He miscalculated the\r\nstrong position and personal valor of the rival with whom he would have\r\nto measure swords.  Charles of Austria was but nineteen, and Francis I.\r\nwas twenty-three, when they entered, as antagonists, into the arena of\r\nEuropean politics.  Charles had as yet gained no battle and won no\r\nrenown; while Francis I. was already a victorious king and a famous\r\nknight.  But the young archduke’s able governor, William de Croy, Lord of\r\nChievres, “had early trained him,” says M. Mignet, “to the understanding\r\nand management of his various interests; from the time that he was\r\nfifteen, Charles presided every day at his council; there he himself read\r\nout the contents of despatches which were delivered to him the moment\r\nthey arrived, were it even in the dead of night; his council had become\r\nhis school, and business served him for books.  .  .  .  Being naturally\r\nendowed with superior parts, a penetrating intellect and rare firmness of\r\ncharacter, he schooled himself to look Fortune in the face without being\r\nintoxicated by her smiles or troubled at her frowns, to be astonished by\r\nnothing that happened, and to make up his mind in any danger.  He had\r\neven now the will of an emperor and an overawing manner. ‘His dignity and\r\nloftiness of soul are such,’ says a contemporary writer, ‘that he seems\r\nto hold the universe under his feet.’”  Charles’s position in Germany was\r\nas strong as the man himself; he was a German, a duke of Austria, of the\r\nimperial line, as natural a successor of his grandfather Maximilian at\r\nFrankfort as of his grandfather Ferdinand at Madrid.  Such was the\r\nadversary, with such advantages of nationality and of person, against\r\nwhom Francis I., without any political necessity, and for the sole\r\npurpose of indulging an ambitious vision and his own kingly self-esteem,\r\nwas about to engage in a struggle which was to entail a heavy burden on\r\nhis whole life, and bring him not in triumph to Constantinople, but in\r\ncaptivity to Madrid.\r\n\r\nBefore the death of Maximilian, and when neither party had done more than\r\nforesee the struggle and get ready for it, Francis I. was for some time\r\nable to hope for some success.  Seven German princes, three\r\necclesiastical and four laic, the Archbishops of Mayence, Cologne, and\r\nTroves, and the Duke of Saxony, the Margrave of Brandenburg, the Count\r\nPalatine of the Rhine, and the King of Bohemia, had the sole power of\r\nelecting the emperor.  Four of them, the Archbishops of Troves and of\r\nCologne, the Count Palatine of the Rhine and the Margrave of Brandenburg,\r\nhad favorably received the overtures of Francis I., and had promised him\r\ntheir suffrages.  His devoted servant, Robert de la Marck, Lord of\r\nFleuranges, had brought to him at Amboise a German gentleman from the\r\nPalatinate, Franz von Sickingen, “of very petty family, but a very gentle\r\ncompanion,” says Fleuranges, “the most beautiful talker that I think I\r\never saw in my life, and in so much that there was no gentleman in\r\nGermany, prince or man of war, who would not have been glad to do him\r\npleasure.”  Francis I. had received him with very chivalrous grace, and\r\nhad given him a pension of three thousand livres and handsome presents\r\nfor his comrades in adventure; and Sickingen was so charmed that he said\r\nto Fleuranges on leaving Amboise, “The king did not open his heart to me\r\non the subject of the empire; however, I know all about it, and I beg you\r\nto tell him that I will do his service and keep the oath I gave him.”\r\n A more important personage than Sickingen, Leo X., would have been very\r\nglad to have for emperor in Germany neither the King of France nor the\r\nKing of Spain, both of them being far too powerful in Europe and far too\r\nemulous in Italy not to be dangerous enemies or inconvenient allies for\r\nhim; and he tried to dissuade Francis I. from making any claim to the\r\nempire, and to induce him to employ his influence in bringing about the\r\nelection of a second-rate German prince, Frederick the Wise, Duke of\r\nSaxony, who was justly popular in Germany, and who would never be in a\r\ncondition to do France any harm.  It was judicious advice and a policy\r\ngood for France as well as for Europe in general; but Francis I.,\r\ninfatuated by his desire and his hope, did not relish it at all; and Leo\r\nX., being obliged to choose between the two great claimants, declared for\r\nFrancis I., without any pleasure or confidence, but also without any\r\ngreat perplexity, for he had but little faith in the success which he\r\nmade a show of desiring.  Francis, deceived by these appearances and\r\npromises, on the part both of ecclesiastics and laics, held language\r\nbreathing a gallant and almost careless confidence.  “We are not enemies,\r\nyour master and I,” he said to the ambassadors of Spain; “we are two\r\nlovers courting the same mistress: whichever of the two she may prefer,\r\nthe other will have to submit, and harbor no resentment.”  But when,\r\nshortly after Maximilian’s death, the struggle became closer and the\r\nissue nearer, the inequality between the forces and chances of the two\r\nrivals became quite manifest, and Francis I. could no longer affect the\r\nsame serenity.  He had intrusted the management of his affairs in Germany\r\nto a favorite comrade of his early youth, Admiral de Bonnivet, a soldier\r\nand a courtier, witty, rash, sumptuous, eager to display his master’s\r\npower and magnificence.  Charles of Austria’s agents, and at their head\r\nhis aunt Margaret, who had the government of the Low Countries in his\r\nabsence, were experienced, deliberate, discreet, more eager to succeed in\r\ntheir purpose than to make a brilliant appearance, and resolved to do\r\nquietly whatever was necessary for success.  And to do so they were\r\nbefore long as fully authorized as they were resolved.  They discovered\r\nthat Francis I. had given Bonnivet four hundred thousand crowns in gold\r\nthat he might endeavor to bribe the electors; it was, according to\r\nreport, double the sum Charles of Austria had promised for the same\r\nobject; and his agents sent him information of it, and received this\r\nanswer: “We are wholly determined to spare nothing and to stake all for\r\nall upon it, as the matter we most desire and have most at heart in this\r\nworld.  .  .  .  The election must be secured, whatever it may cost me.”\r\n The question before the seven elective princes who were to dispose of the\r\nempire was thenceforth merely which of the two claimants would be the\r\nhigher and the safer bidder.  Francis I. engaged in a tussle of wealth\r\nand liberality with Charles of Austria.  One of his agents wrote to him,\r\n“All will go well if we can fill the maw of the Margrave Joachim of\r\nBrandenburg; he and his brother the elector from Mayence fall every day\r\ninto deeper depths of avarice; we must hasten to satisfy them with\r\n_speed, speed, speed_.”  Francis I. replied, “I will have Marquis Joachim\r\n_gorged_ at any price;” and he accordingly made over to him in ready\r\nmoney and bills of short dates all that was asked for by the margrave,\r\nwho on the 8th of April, 1519, gave a written undertaking to support the\r\ncandidature “of the most invincible and Most Christian prince, Francis,\r\nby the grace of God King of the French, Duke of Milan, and Lord of Genoa,\r\nwho, what with his vigorous age, his ability, his justice, his military\r\nexperience, the brilliant fortune of his arms, and all other qualities\r\nrequired for war and the management of the commonwealth, surpasses, in\r\nthe judgment of every one, all other Christian princes.”  But Charles of\r\nAustria did not consider himself beaten because two of the seven electors\r\ndisplayed avarice and venality.  His aunt Margaret and his principal\r\nagent in Germany, the Chamberlain Armerstoff, resumed financial\r\nnegotiations with the Archbishop of Mayence, for his brother the margrave\r\nas well as for himself, and the archbishop, without any formal\r\nengagement, accepted the Austrian over-bid.  “I am ashamed at his\r\nshamelessness,” wrote Armerstorff to Charles.  Alternate and antagonistic\r\nbargaining went on thus for more than two months.  The Archbishop of\r\nCologne, Hermann von Wied, kept wavering between the two claimants; but\r\nhe was careful to tell John d’Albret, Francis I.’s agent, that “he\r\nsincerely hoped that his Majesty would follow the doctrine of God, who\r\ngave as much to those who went to work in His vineyard towards the middle\r\nof the day as to those who had been at it all the morning.”  Duke\r\nFrederick of Saxony was the only one of the seven electors who absolutely\r\nrefused to make any promise, as well as to accept any offer, and\r\npreserved his independence, as well as his dignity.  The rumor of all\r\nthese traffickings and these uncertainties rekindled in Henry VIII., King\r\nof England, a fancy for placing himself once more in the ranks; but his\r\nagent, Richard Pace, found the negotiations too far advanced and the\r\nprices too high for him to back up this vain whim of his master’s; and\r\nHenry VIII. abandoned it.  The diet had been convoked for the 17th of\r\nJune at Frankfort.  The day was drawing near; and which of the two\r\nparties had the majority was still regarded as, uncertain.  Franz von\r\nSickingen appeared in the outskirts of Frankfort with more than twenty\r\nthousand men of the German army, “whereat marvellously astonished,” says\r\nFleuranges, “were they who wished well to the King of France and very\r\nmightily rejoiced they who wished well to the Catholic king.”\r\n The gentleman-adventurer had not been less accessible than the\r\nprince-electors to bribery.  The diet opened on the 18th of June.  The\r\nArchbishop of Mayence made a great speech in favor of Charles of Austria;\r\nand the Archbishop of Troves spoke in favor of Francis I., to whom he had\r\nremained faithful.  Rival intrigues were kept up; Sickingen and his\r\ntroops were a clog upon deliberation; the electors were embarrassed and\r\nweary of their dissensions; and the Archbishop of Troves proposed by way\r\nof compromise the election of the Duke of Saxony, Frederick the Wise,\r\nwho, at this crisis so shameful for his peers, had just given fresh\r\nproofs of his sound judgment, his honesty, and his patriotic\r\nindependence.  But Frederick declined the honor it was intended to do\r\nhim, and which he considered beyond his powers to support; and he voted\r\nfor Archduke Charles, “a real German prince,” said he, “the choice of\r\nwhom seemed to him most natural in point of right and most suitable in\r\npoint of fact under the present circumstances of Europe.”  The six other\r\nelectors gave in to his opinion, and that same day, June 18, 1519,\r\nunanimously elected the King of Spain, Charles, King of the Romans and\r\nEmperor of Germany, with the title of Charles V.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Charles V----39]\r\n\r\nWhatever pains were taken by Francis I. to keep up a good appearance\r\nafter this heavy reverse, his mortification was profound, and he thought\r\nof nothing but getting his revenge.  He flattered himself he would find\r\nsomething of the sort in a solemn interview and an appearance of alliance\r\nwith Henry VIII., King of England, who had, like himself, just undergone\r\nin the election to the empire a less flagrant but an analogous reverse.\r\nIt had already, in the previous year and on the occasion of a treaty\r\nconcluded between the two kings for the restitution of Tournai to France,\r\nbeen settled that they should meet before long in token of\r\nreconciliation.  Allusion had even been made, at that period, to a much\r\nmore important restitution, of Calais in fact, for which Francis I., at\r\nwhat price we know not, had obtained the advocacy of Cardinal Wolsey, who\r\nwas then all-powerful with Henry VIII.  “Of what use to Us,” Wolsey had\r\nsaid, “is this town of Calais, where in time of peace as well as of war\r\nwe have to keep up such numerous garrisons, which costs us so much money,\r\nand which so often forces us to measures contrary to the real interests\r\nof England?”  But this idea was vehemently scouted by the English, and\r\nthe coming interview between the two kings remained the sole accessory of\r\nthe treaty of 1518.  After Charles V.’s election to the empire, Francis\r\nI. was eager to claim this interview, which was sure to cause in Europe\r\nthe impression of a close understanding between the two kings before the\r\nvery eyes of their common rival.  A convention, signed on the 26th of\r\nMarch, 1520, regulated its details.  It was stipulated that the two kings\r\nshould meet in Picardy between Guines, an English possession in the\r\nneighborhood of Calais, and Ardres, which belonged to France.  But, so\r\nsoon as Charles V., at that time in Spain, was informed of this design,\r\nhe used all his efforts to make it abortive.  Henry, however, stood firm;\r\nnot that he had resolved to knit himself closely with Francis I. against\r\nthe new emperor, whom, a few months previously, he had shown alacrity in\r\nfelicitating upon his accession to the empire, but he was unwilling to\r\nfail in his promise to the King of France, and he liked to assume in\r\nrespect of the two rivals the part of an arbiter equally courted by both.\r\nCharles V., still actively working against the interview, entered into\r\nsecret negotiation with Cardinal Wolsey to obtain for himself also an\r\ninterview with Henry VIII., which would destroy the effect of that in\r\ncourse of arrangement between the Kings of France and England.  In\r\nwriting to Wolsey he called him his “very dear friend,” and guaranteed\r\nhim a pension of seven thousand ducats, secured upon two Spanish\r\nbishoprics; and on the 26th of May, 1520, Henry VIII. received at\r\nCanterbury, as he was passing by on his way to embark at Dover for the\r\ninterview in France, the as it were unexpected information that Charles\r\nV. had just arrived with his fleet at the port of Hythe.  The king\r\nimmediately sent Wolsey to meet the emperor, who disembarked at Dover,\r\nwhither Henry went to visit him; and the two sovereigns repaired together\r\nto Canterbury, where they went in state to the cathedral, “resplendent,”\r\n says Erasmus, “with all the precious gifts it had received for so many\r\ncenturies, especially with the most precious of all, the chest containing\r\nthe remains of Thomas a-Becket, so magnificent that gold was the least of\r\nits ornaments.”  There they passed three days, treating of their affairs\r\nin the midst of galas, during which Charles V. completely won over Wolsey\r\nby promising to help him to become pope.  On the 31st of May, 1520,\r\nCharles, quite easy about the interview in France, embarked at Sandwich\r\nfor his Flemish possessions, and Henry VIII. made sail for Calais, his\r\npoint of departure to the place agreed upon for Francis to meet him, and\r\nwhere they had made up their minds, both of them, to display all the\r\nsplendors of their two courts.\r\n\r\nThis meeting has remained celebrated in history far more for its royal\r\npomp, and for the personal incidents which were connected with it, than\r\nfor its political results.  It was called _The Field of Cloth of Gold;_\r\nand the courtiers who attended the two sovereigns felt bound to almost\r\nrival them in sumptuousness, “insomuch,” says the contemporary Martin du\r\nBellay, “that many bore thither their mills, their forests, and their\r\nmeadows on their backs.”  Henry VIII. had employed eleven hundred\r\nworkmen, the most skilful of Flanders and Holland, in building a\r\nquadrangular palace of wood, one hundred and twenty-eight feet long every\r\nway; on one side of the entrance-gate was a fountain, covered with\r\ngilding, and surmounted by a statue of Bacchus, round which there flowed\r\nthrough subterranean pipes all sorts of wines, and which bore in letters\r\nof gold the inscription, “Make good cheer, who will;” and on the other\r\nside a column, supported by four lions, was surmounted by a statue of\r\nCupid armed with bow and arrows.  Opposite the palace was erected a huge\r\nfigure of a savage wearing the arms of his race, with this inscription,\r\nchosen by Henry VIII.: “He whom I back wins.”  The frontage was covered\r\noutside with canvas painted to represent freestone; and the inside was\r\nhung with rich tapestries.  Francis I., emulous of equalling his royal\r\nneighbor in magnificence, had ordered to be erected close to Ardres an\r\nimmense tent, upheld in the middle by a colossal pole firmly fixed in the\r\nground and with pegs and cordage all around it.  Outside, the tent, in\r\nthe shape of a dome, was covered with cloth of gold; and, inside, it\r\nrepresented a sphere with a ground of blue velvet and studded with stars,\r\nlike the firmament.  At each angle of the large tent there was a small\r\none equally richly decorated.  But before the two sovereigns exchanged\r\nvisits, in the midst of all these magnificent preparations, there arose\r\na violent hurricane, which tore up the pegs and split the cordage of the\r\nFrench tent, scattered them over the ground, and forced Francis I. to\r\ntake up his quarters in an old castle near Ardres.  When the two kings’\r\ntwo chief councillors, Cardinal Wolsey on one side and Admiral Bonnivet\r\non the other, had regulated the formalities, on the 7th of June, 1520,\r\nFrancis I. and Henry VIII. set out on their way, at the same hour and the\r\nsame pace, for their meeting in the valley of Ardres, where a tent had\r\nbeen prepared for them.  As they drew near, some slight anxiety was\r\nmanifested by the escort of the King of England, amongst whom a belief\r\nprevailed that that of the King of France was more numerous; but it was\r\nsoon perceived to be nothing of the sort.  The two kings, mounted upon\r\nfine horses and superbly dressed, advanced towards one another; and Henry\r\nVIII.’s horse stumbled, which his servants did not like.  The two kings\r\nsaluted each other with easy grace, exchanged embraces without getting\r\noff their horses, dismounted, and proceeded arm-in-arm to the tent where\r\nWolsey and De Bonnivet were awaiting them.  “My dear brother and cousin,”\r\n immediately said Francis with his easy grace, “I am come a long way, and\r\nnot without trouble, to see you in person.  I hope that you hold me for\r\nsuch as I am, ready to give you aid with the kingdoms and lordships that\r\nare in my power.”  Henry, with a somewhat cold reserve, replied, “It is\r\nnot your kingdoms or your divers possessions that I regard, but the\r\nsoundness and loyal observance of the promises set down in the treaties\r\nbetween you and me.  My eyes never beheld a prince who could be dearer to\r\nmy heart, and I have crossed the seas at the extreme boundary of my\r\nkingdom to come and see you.”  The two kings entered the tent and signed\r\na treaty whereby the Dauphin of France was to marry Princess Mary, only\r\ndaughter at that time of Henry VIII., to whom Francis I. undertook to pay\r\nannually a sum of one hundred thousand livres [two million eight hundred\r\nthousand francs, or one hundred and twelve thousand pounds in the money\r\nof our day], until the marriage was celebrated, which would not be for\r\nsome time yet, as the English princess was only four years old.  The two\r\nkings took wine together, according to custom, and reciprocally presented\r\nthe members of their courts.  “King Francis,” says Henry VIII.’s favorite\r\nchronicler, Edward Hall, who was there, “is an amiable prince, proud in\r\nbearing and gay in manner, with a brown complexion, large eyes, long\r\nnose, thick lips, broad chest and shoulders, short legs, and big feet.”\r\n Titian’s portrait gives a loftier and more agreeable idea of Francis I.\r\n\r\nWhen the two kings proceeded to sign, in their tent, the treaty they had\r\njust concluded, “the King of England,” according to Fleuranges’\r\n_Memoires,_ “himself took up the articles and began to read them.  When\r\nhe had read those relating to the King of France, who was to have the\r\npriority, and came to speak of himself, he got as far as, ‘I, Henry,\r\nKing’ .  .  .  (he would have said of _France and England_), but he left\r\nout the title as far as France was concerned, and said to King Francis,\r\n‘I will not put it in as you are here, for I should lie;’ and he said\r\nonly, ‘I Henry, King of _England_.’”  But, as M. Mignet very properly\r\nsays, “if he omitted the title in his reading, he left it in the treaty\r\nitself, and, shortly afterwards, was ambitious to render it a reality,\r\nwhen he invaded France and wished to reign over it.”\r\n\r\nAfter the diplomatic stipulations were concluded, the royal meeting was\r\nprolonged for sixteen days, which were employed in tourneys, jousts, and\r\nall manner of festivals.  The personal communication of the two kings was\r\nregulated with all the precautions of official mistrust and restraint;\r\nand when the King of England went to Ardres to see the Queen of France,\r\nthe King of France had to go to Guines to see the Queen of England, for\r\nthe two kings were hostages for one another.  “The King of France, who\r\nwas not a suspicious man,” says Fleuranges, “was mighty vexed at there\r\nbeing so little confidence in one another.  He got up one morning very\r\nearly, which is not his habit, took two gentlemen and a page, the first\r\nthree he could find, mounted his horse, and went to visit the King of\r\nEngland at the castle of Guines.  When he came on to the castle-bridge,\r\nall the English were mighty astonished.  As he rode amongst them, the\r\nking gayly called upon them to surrender to him, and asked them the way\r\nto the chamber of the king his brother, the which was pointed out to him\r\nby the governor of Guines, who said to him, ‘Sir, he is not awake.’  But\r\nKing Francis passed on all the same, went up to the said chamber, knocked\r\nat the door, awoke the King of England, and walked in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Francis I. surprises Henry VIII.----44]\r\n\r\nNever was man more dumbfounded than King Henry, who said to King Francis,\r\n‘Brother, you have done me a better turn than ever man did to another,\r\nand you show me the great trust I ought to have in you.  I yield myself\r\nyour prisoner from this moment, and I proffer you my parole.’  He undid\r\nfrom his neck a collar worth fifteen thousand angels, and begged the King\r\nof France to take it and wear it that very day for his prisoner’s sake.\r\nAnd, lo, the king, who wished to do him the same turn, had brought with\r\nhim a bracelet which was worth more than thirty thousand angels, and\r\nbegged him to wear it for his sake, which thing he did, and the King of\r\nFrance put what had been given him on his neck.  Thereupon the King of\r\nEngland was minded to get up, and the King of France said that he should\r\nhave no other chamber-attendant but himself, and he warmed his shirt and\r\nhanded it to him when he was up.  The King of France made up his mind to\r\ngo back, notwithstanding that the King of England would have kept him to\r\ndinner; but, inasmuch as there was to be jousting after dinner, he\r\nmounted his horse and went back to Ardres.  He met a many good folk who\r\nwere coming to meet him, amongst the rest l’Aventureux [a name given to\r\nFleuranges himself], who said to him, ‘My dear master, you are mad to\r\nhave done what you have done; I am very glad to see you back here, and\r\ndevil take him who counselled you.’  Whereupon the king said that never a\r\nsoul had counselled him, and that he knew well that there was not a soul\r\nin his kingdom who would have so counselled him; and then he began to\r\ntell what he had done at the said Guines, and so returned, conversing, to\r\nArdres, for it was not far.”\r\n\r\n“Then began the jousts, which lasted a week, and were wondrous fine, both\r\na-foot and a-horseback.  After all these pastimes the King of France and\r\nthe King of England retired to a pavilion, where they drank together.\r\nAnd there the King of England took the King of France by the collar, and\r\nsaid to him, ‘Brother, I should like to wrestle with you,’ and gave him a\r\nfeint or two; and the King of France, who is a mighty good wrestler, gave\r\nhim a turn and threw him on the ground.  And the King of England would\r\nhave had yet another trial; but all that was broken off, and it was time\r\nto go to supper.  After this they had yet three or four jousts and\r\nbanquets, and then they took leave of one another [on the 24th of June,\r\n1520], with the greatest possible peace between the princes and\r\nprincesses.  That done, the King of England returned to Guines, and the\r\nKing of France to France; and it was not without giving great gifts at\r\nparting, one to another.”  [_Memoires de Fleuranges,_ pp.  349-363.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Field of the Cloth of Gold----45]\r\n\r\nHaving left the Field of Cloth of Gold for Amboise, his favorite\r\nresidence, Francis I. discovered that Henry VIII., instead of returning\r\ndirect to England, had gone, on the 10th of July, to Gravelines, in\r\nFlanders, to pay a visit to Charles V., who had afterwards accompanied\r\nhim to Calais.  The two sovereigns had spent three days there, and\r\nCharles V., on separating from the King of England, had commissioned him\r\nto regulate, as arbiter, all difficulties that might arise between\r\nhimself and the King of France.  Assuredly nothing was less calculated to\r\ninspire Francis I. with confidence in the results of his meeting with\r\nHenry VIII. and of their mutual courtesies.  Though he desired to avoid\r\nthe appearance of taking the initiative in war, he sought every occasion\r\nand pretext for recommencing it; and it was not long before he found them\r\nin the Low Countries, in Navarre, and in Italy.  A trial was made of\r\nHenry VIII.’s mediation and of a conference at Calais; and a discussion\r\nwas raised touching the legitimate nature of the protection afforded by\r\nthe two rival sovereigns to their petty allies.  But the real fact was,\r\nthat Francis I. had a reverse to make up for and a passion to gratify;\r\nand the struggle recommenced in April, 1521, in the Low Countries.\r\nCharles V., when he heard that the French had crossed his frontier,\r\nexclaimed, “God be praised that I am not the first to commence the war,\r\nand that the King of France is pleased to make me greater than I am, for,\r\nin a little while, either I shall be a very poor emperor or he will be a\r\npoor King of France.”  The campaign opened in the north, to the advantage\r\nof France, by the capture of Hesdin; Admiral Bonnivet, who had the\r\ncommand on the frontier of Spain, reduced some small forts of Biscay and\r\nthe fortress of Fontarabia; and Marshal de Lautrec, governor of Milaness,\r\nhad orders to set out at once to go and defend it against the Spaniards\r\nand Imperialists, who were concentrating for its invasion.\r\n\r\nLautrec was but little adapted for this important commission.  He had\r\nbeen made governor of Milaness in August, 1516, to replace the Constable\r\nde Bourbon, whose recall to France the queen-mother, Louise of Savoy, had\r\ndesired and stimulated.  Lautrec had succeeded ill in his government.  He\r\nwas active and brave, but he was harsh, haughty, jealous, imperious, and\r\ngrasping; and he had embroiled himself with most of the Milanese lords,\r\namongst others with the veteran J. J. Trivulzio, who, under Charles VIII.\r\nand Louis XII., had done France such great service in Italy.  Trivulzio,\r\noffensively treated at Milan, and subjected to accusations at Paris,\r\nwent, at eighty-two years of age, to France to justify himself before the\r\nking; but Francis I. gave him a cold reception, barely spoke to him, and\r\ndeclined his explanations.  One day, at Arpajon, Trivulzio heard that the\r\nking was to pass on horseback through the town; and, being unable to\r\nwalk, had himself carried, ill as he was, in his chair to the middle of\r\nthe street.  The king passed with averted head, and without replying to\r\nTrivulzio, who cried, “Sir, ah! sir, just one moment’s audience!”\r\n Trivulzio, on reaching home, took to his bed, and died there a month\r\nafterwards, on the 5th of December, 1518, having himself dictated this\r\nepitaph, which was inscribed on his tomb, at Milan, “J. J. Trivulzio, son\r\nof Anthony: he who never rested, rests.  Hush!” [_J. J. Trivultius,\r\nAntonii filius, qui nunquam quievit, quiescit.  Tace!_]\r\n\r\nFrancis I., when informed that Trivulzio was near his end, regretted, it\r\nis said, his harsh indifference, and sent to express to him his regret;\r\nbut, “It is too late,” answered the dying man.  In the king’s harshness\r\nthere was something more than ungrateful forgetfulness of a veteran’s\r\nancient services.  While Francis was bringing about a renewal of war in\r\nItaly, in the Low Countries, and on the frontier of Spain, he was\r\nabandoning himself at Paris, Tours, Amboise, and wherever he resided, to\r\nall the diversions and all the enticements of the brilliant court which\r\nwas gathered around him.  Extravagance and pleasure were a passion with\r\nhim.  “There has been talk,” says Brantome, “of the great outlay,\r\nmagnificence, sumptuousness and halls of Lucullus; but in nought of that\r\nkind did he ever come near our king .  .  .  and what is most rare is,\r\nthat in a village, in the forest, at the meet, there was the same service\r\nas there would have been in Paris.  .  .  .  One day, when the king was\r\nexpecting the Emperor Charles to dinner, word came that he had slipped\r\naway, and had gone to give a sudden surprise to the constable, just as he\r\nwas sitting down to table, and to dine with him and all his comrades\r\ncomradewise.  He found this table as well furnished and supplied, and\r\nladen with victuals as well cooked and flavored, as if they had been in\r\nParis or some other good city of France; whereat the emperor was so\r\nmightily astonished that he said that there was no such grandeur in the\r\nworld as that of such a King of France.  .  .  .  In respect of ladies,\r\nof a surety it must be confessed that before the time of King Francis\r\nthey set foot in and frequented the court but little and in but small\r\nnumbers.  It is true that Queen Anne (of Brittany) began to make her\r\nladies’ court larger than it had been under former queens; and, without\r\nher, the king her husband (Louis XII.) would have taken no trouble about\r\nit.  But Francis I., coming to reign, and considering that the whole\r\ngrace of the court was the ladies, was pleased to fill it up with them\r\nmore than had been the ancient custom.  Since, in truth, a court without\r\nladies is a garden without any pretty flowers, and more resembles a\r\nSatrap’s or a Turk’s court than that of a great Christian king.  .  .  .\r\nAs for me, I hold that there was never anything better introduced than\r\nthe ladies’ court.  Full often have I seen our kings go to camp, or town,\r\nor elsewhither, remain there and divert themselves for some days, and yet\r\ntake thither no ladies.  But we were so bewildered, so lost, so moped,\r\nthat for the week we spent away from them and their pretty eyes it\r\nappeared to us a year; and always a-wishing, ‘When shall we be at the\r\ncourt?’  Not, full often, calling that the court where the king was, but\r\nthat where the queen and ladies were.”  [_OEuvres de Brantome, edition of\r\nthe Societe de l’Histoire de France,_ t. iii.  pp. 120-129.]\r\n\r\nNow, when so many fair ladies are met together in a life of sumptuousness\r\nand gayety, a king is pretty sure to find favorites, and royal favorites\r\nrarely content themselves with pleasing the king; they desire to make\r\ntheir favor serviceable their family and their friends.  Francis I.  had\r\nmade choice one, Frances de Foix, countess of Chateaubriant, beautiful\r\nambitious, dexterous, haughty, readily venturing upon rivalry with even\r\nthe powerful queen-mother.  She had three brothers; Lautrec was one of\r\nthe three, and she supported him in all his pretensions and all his\r\ntrials of fortune.  When he set out to go and take the command in Italy,\r\nhe found himself at the head of an army numerous indeed, but badly\r\nequipped, badly paid, and at grips with Prosper Colonna, the most able\r\namongst the chiefs of the coalition formed at this juncture between\r\nCharles V. and Pope Leo X. against the French.  Lautrec did not succeed\r\nin preventing Milan from falling into the hands of the Imperialists, and,\r\nafter an uncertain campaign of some months’ duration, he lost at La\r\nBicocca, near Monza, on the 27th of April, 1522, a battle, which left in\r\nthe power of Francis I., in Lombardy, only the citadels of Milan,\r\nCremona, and Novara.  At the news of these reverses, Francis I. repaired\r\nto Lyons, to consult as to the means of applying a remedy.  Lautrec also\r\narrived there.  “The king,” says Martin du Bellay, “gave him a bad\r\nreception, as the man by whose fault he considered he had lost his duchy\r\nof Milan, and would not speak to him.”  Lautrec found an occasion for\r\naddressing the king, and complained vehemently of “the black looks he\r\ngave him.”  “And good reason,” said the king, “when you have lost me such\r\na heritage as the duchy of Milan.”  “‘Twas not I who lost it,” answered\r\nLautrec; “‘twas your Majesty yourself: I several times warned you that,\r\nif I were not helped with money, there was no means of retaining the\r\nmen-at-arms, who had served for eighteen months without a penny, and\r\nlikewise the Swiss, who forced me to fight at a disadvantage, which they\r\nwould never have done if they had received their pay.”  “I sent you four\r\nhundred thousand crowns when you asked for them.”  “I received the\r\nletters in which your Majesty notified me of this money, but the money\r\nnever.”  The king sent at once for the superintendent-general of finance,\r\nJames de Beaune, Baron of Semblancay, who acknowledged having received\r\norders on the subject from the king, but added that at the very moment\r\nwhen he was about to send this sum to the army, the queen-mother had come\r\nand asked him for it, and had received it from him, whereof he was ready\r\nto make oath.  Francis I. entered his mother’s room in a rage,\r\nreproaching her with having been the cause of losing him his duchy of\r\nMilan.  “I should never have believed it of you,” he said, “that you would\r\nhave kept money ordered for the service of my army.”  The queen-mother,\r\nsomewhat confused at first, excused herself by saying, that “those were\r\nmoneys proceeding from the savings which she had made out of her\r\nrevenues, and had given to the superintendent to take care of.”\r\n Semblancay stuck to what he had said.  The question became a personal one\r\nbetween the queen-mother and the minister; and commissioners were\r\nappointed to decide the difference.  Chancellor Duprat was the docile\r\nservant of Louise of Savoy and the enemy of Semblancay, whose authority\r\nin financial matters he envied; and he chose the commissioners from\r\namongst the mushroom councillors he had lately brought into Parliament.\r\nThe question between the queen-mother and the superintendent led to\r\nnothing less than the trial of Semblancay.  The trial lasted five years,\r\nand, on the 9th of April, 1527, a decree of Parliament condemned\r\nSemblancay to the punishment of death and confiscation of all his\r\nproperty; not for the particular matter which had been the origin of the\r\nquarrel, but “as attained and convicted of larcenies, falsifications,\r\nabuses, malversations, and maladministration of the king’s finances,\r\nwithout prejudice as to the debt claimed by the said my lady, the mother\r\nof the king.”  Semblancay, accordingly, was hanged on the gibbet of\r\nMontfaucon, on the 12th of August.  In spite of certain ambiguities which\r\narose touching some acts of his administration and some details of his\r\ntrial, public feeling was generally and very strongly in his favor.  He\r\nwas an old and faithful servant of the crown; and Francis I. had for a\r\nlong time called him “his father.”  He was evidently the victim of the\r\nqueen-mother’s greed and vengeance.  The firmness of his behavior, at the\r\ntime of his execution, became a popular theme in the verses of Clement\r\nMarot:--\r\n\r\n          When Maillart, officer of hell, escorted\r\n          To Montfaucon Semblancay, doomed to die,\r\n          Which, to your thinking, of the twain supported\r\n          The better havior?  I will make reply:\r\n          Maillart was like the man to death proceeding;\r\n          And Semblancay so stout an ancient looked,\r\n          It seemed, forsooth, as if himself were leading\r\n          Lieutenant Maillard--to the gallows booked!\r\n\r\nIt is said that, at the very moment of execution, Semblancay, waiting on\r\nthe scaffold for at least a commutation of the penalty, said, “Had I\r\nserved God as I have served the king, He would not have made me wait so\r\nlong.”  Nearly two centuries later, in 1683, a more celebrated minister\r\nthan Semblancay, Colbert, in fact, as he was dying tranquilly in his bed,\r\nafter having for twenty years served Louis XIV., and in that service made\r\nthe fortune of his family as well as his own, said also, “Had I done for\r\nGod what I have done for yonder man, I had been twice saved; and now I\r\nknow not what will become of me.”  A striking similarity in language and\r\nsentiment, in spite of such different ends, between two great councillors\r\nof kings, both devoted during their lives to the affairs of the world,\r\nand both passing, at their last hour, this severe judgment, as\r\nChristians, upon the masters of the world and upon themselves.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the government of Francis I. was involved, through\r\nhis mother’s evil passions, not in an act more morally shameful, but in\r\nan event more politically serious, than the execution of Semblancay.\r\nThere remained in France one puissant prince, the last of the feudal\r\nsemi-sovereigns, and the head of that only one of the provincial\r\ndynasties sprung from the dynasty of the Capetians which still held its\r\nown against the kingly house.  There were no more Dukes of Burgundy,\r\nDukes of Anjou, Counts of Provence, and Dukes of Brittany; by good\r\nfortune or by dexterous management the French kingship had absorbed all\r\nthose kindred and rival states.  Charles II., Duke of Bourbon, alone was\r\ninvested with such power and independence as could lead to rivalry.  He\r\nwas in possession of Bourbonness, of Auvergne, of Le Forez, of La Marche,\r\nof Beaujolais, and a large number of domains and castles in different\r\nparts of France.  Throughout all these possessions he levied taxes and\r\ntroops, convoked the local estates, appointed the officers of justice,\r\nand regulated almost the whole social organism.  He was born on the 10th\r\nof February, 1490, four years before Francis I.; he was the head of the\r\nyounger branch of the Bourbons-Montpensier; and he had married, in 1515,\r\nhis cousin, Suzanne of Bourbon, only daughter of Peter II., head of the\r\nelder branch, and Anne of France, the able and for a long while puissant\r\ndaughter of Louis XI.  Louis XII. had taken great interest in this\r\nmarriage, and it had been stipulated in the contract “that the pair\r\nshould make a mutual and general settlement of all their possessions in\r\nfavor of the survivor.”  Thus the young duke, Charles, had united all the\r\npossessions of the house of Bourbon; and he held at Moulins a brilliant\r\nprincely court, of which he was himself the most brilliant ornament.\r\nHaving been trained from his boyhood in all chivalrous qualities, he was\r\nan accomplished knight before becoming a tried warrior; and he no sooner\r\nappeared upon the field of battle than he won renown not only as a\r\nvaliant prince, but as an eminent soldier.  In 1509, at the battle of\r\nAgnadello, under the eye of Louis XII. himself, he showed that he was a\r\nworthy pupil of La Tremoille, of La Palice, and of Bayard; and in 1512,\r\nat that of Ravenna, his reputation was already so well established in the\r\narmy that, when Gaston de Foix was killed, they clamored for Duke Charles\r\nof Bourbon, then twenty-two years old, as his successor.  Louis XII.\r\ngave him full credit for his bravery and his warlike abilities; but the\r\nyoung prince’s unexpansive character, haughty independence, and momentary\r\nflashes of audacity, caused the veteran king some disquietude.  “I wish,”\r\n said he, “he had a more open, more gay, less taciturn spirit; stagnant\r\nwater affrights me.”  In 1516, the year after Louis XII.’s death, Andrew\r\nTrevisani, Venetian ambassador at Milan, wrote to the Venetian council,\r\n“This Duke of Bourbon handles a sword most gallantly and successfully; he\r\nfears God, he is devout, humane, and very generous; he has a revenue of\r\none hundred and twenty thousand crowns, twenty thousand from his\r\nmother-in-law, Anne of France, and two thousand a month as constable of\r\nFrance; and, according to what is said by M. de Longueville, governor of\r\nParis, he might dispose of half the king’s army for any enterprise he\r\npleased, even if the king did not please.”\r\n\r\nScarcely had Francis I. ascended the throne, on the 12th of January,\r\n1515, when he made the Duke of Bourbon’s great position still greater by\r\ncreating him constable of France.  Was it solely to attach to himself the\r\ngreatest lord and one of the most distinguished soldiers of the kingdom,\r\nor had, perhaps, as has already been hinted, the favor of the\r\nqueen-mother something to do with the duke’s speedy elevation?  The whole\r\nhistory of Charles of Bourbon tends to a belief that the feelings of\r\nLouise of Savoy towards him, her love or her hate, had great influence\r\nupon the decisive incidents of his life.  However that may be, the young\r\nconstable, from the moment of entering upon his office, fully justified\r\nthe king’s choice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Constable de Bourbon----53]\r\n\r\nHe it was who, during the first campaign in Italy, examined in person,\r\nwith the shepherd who had pointed it out, an unknown passage across the\r\nAlps; and, on the 13th and 14th of September, he contributed greatly to\r\nthe victory of Melegnano.  “I can assure you,” wrote Francis I. to his\r\nmother, the regent, “that my brother the constable and M. de St. Pol\r\nsplintered as many lances as any gentlemen of the company whosoever; and\r\nI speak of this as one who saw; they spared themselves as little as if\r\nthey had been wild boars at bay.”  On returning to France the king\r\nappointed the constable governor of conquered Milaness; and to give him a\r\nfurther mark of favor, “he granted him the noble privilege of founding\r\ntrades in all the towns of the kingdom.  This, when the Parliament\r\nenregistered the king’s letters patent, was expressly stated to be in\r\nconsideration of Bourbon’s extraordinary worth, combined with his quality\r\nas a prince of the blood, and not because of his office of constable.”\r\n [_Histoire de la Maison de Bourbon,_ by M. Desormeaux, t. ii.  p. 437.]\r\nThe constable showed that he was as capable of governing as of\r\nconquering.  He foiled all Emperor Maximilian’s attempts to recover\r\nMilaness; and, not receiving from the king money for the maintenance and\r\npay of his troops, he himself advanced one hundred thousand livres,\r\nopened a loan-account in his own name, raised an army-working-corps of\r\nsix thousand men to repair the fortifications of Milan, and obtained from\r\nthe Swiss cantons permission to enlist twelve thousand recruits amongst\r\nthem.  His exercise of authority over the Lombard population was\r\nsometimes harsh, but always judicious and efficient.  Nevertheless, in\r\nthe spring of 1516, eight months after the victory of Melegnano and but\r\ntwo months after he had driven Emperor Maximilian from Milaness, the Duke\r\nof Bourbon was suddenly recalled, and Marshal de Lautrec was appointed\r\ngovernor in his place.  When the constable arrived at Lyons, where the\r\ncourt then happened to be, “the king,” says Fleuranges in his Memoires,\r\n“gave him marvellously good welcome;” but kings are too ready to imagine\r\nthat their gracious words suffice to hide or make up for their acts of\r\nreal disfavor; and the Duke of Bourbon was too proud to delude himself.\r\nIf he had any desire to do so, the way in which the king’s government\r\ntreated him soon revealed to him his real position: the advances he had\r\nmade and the debts he had contracted for the service of the crown in\r\nMilaness, nay, his salary as constable and his personal pensions, were\r\nunpaid.  Was this the effect of secret wrath on the part of the\r\nqueen-mother, hurt because he seemed to disdain her good graces, or an\r\nact arising may be from mistrust and may be from carelessness on the\r\nking’s part, or merely a result of the financial disorder into which the\r\naffairs of Francis I. were always falling?  These questions cannot be\r\nsolved with certainty.  Anyhow the constable, though thus maltreated,\r\ndid not cry out; but his royal patroness and mother-in-law, Anne of\r\nFrance, daughter of Louis XI., dowager-duchess of the house of Bourbon,\r\ncomplained of these proceedings to the king’s mother, and uttered the\r\nword ingratitude. The dispute between the two princesses grew rancorous;\r\nthe king intervened to reconcile them; speedy payment was promised of\r\nall that was due to the constable, but the promise was not kept.  The\r\nconstable did not consider it seemly to wait about; so he quitted the\r\ncourt and withdrew into his own duchy, to Moulins, not openly disgraced,\r\nbut resolved to set himself, by his proud independence, above the reach\r\nof ill-will, whether on the king’s part or his mother’s.\r\n\r\nMoulins was an almost kingly residence.  “The dukes,” said the Venetian\r\ntraveller Andrew Navagero, in 1528, “have built there fortress-wise a\r\nmagnificent palace, with beautiful gardens, groves, fountains, and all\r\nthe sumptuous appliances of a prince’s dwelling.”  No sooner did the\r\nconstable go to reside there than numbers of the nobility flocked thither\r\naround him.  The feudal splendor of this abode was shortly afterwards\r\nenhanced by an auspicious domestic incident.  In 1517 the Duchess of\r\nBourbon was confined there of a son, a blessing for some time past\r\nunhoped for.  The delighted constable determined to make of the child’s\r\nbaptism a great and striking event; and he begged the king to come and be\r\ngodfather, with the dowager Duchess of Bourbon as godmother.  Francis I.\r\nconsented and repaired to Moulins with his mother and nearly all his\r\ncourt.  The constable’s magnificence astonished even the magnificent king\r\n“five hundred gentlemen, all clad in velvet, and all wearing a chain of\r\ngold going three times round the neck,” were in habitual attendance upon\r\nthe duke; “the throng of the invited was so great that neither the castle\r\nof Moulins nor the town itself sufficed to lodge them; tents had to be\r\npitched in the public places, in the streets, in the park.”  Francis I.\r\ncould not refrain from saying that a King of France would have much\r\ndifficulty in making such a show; the queen-mother did not hide her\r\njealousy; regal temper came into collision with feudal pride.  Admiral\r\nBonnivet, a vassal of the constable and a favorite of the king, was\r\nhaving built, hard by Chatellerault, a castle so vast and so magnificent,\r\n“that he seemed,” says Brantome, “to be minded to ride the high horse\r\nover the house of M. de Bourbon, in such wise that it should appear only\r\na nest beside his own.”  Francis I., during a royal promenade, took the\r\nconstable one day to see the edifice the admiral was building, and asked\r\nhim what he thought of it.  “I think,” said Bourbon, “that the cage is\r\ntoo big and too fine for the bird.”  “Ah!” said the king, “do you not\r\nspeak with somewhat of envy?”  “I!” cried the constable; “I feel envy of\r\na gentleman whose ancestors thought themselves right happy to be squires\r\nto mine!”  In their casual and familiar conversations the least pretext\r\nwould lead to sharp words between the Duke of Bourbon and his kingly\r\nguest.  The king was rallying him one day on the attachment he was\r\nsuspected of having felt for a lady of the court.  “Sir,” said the\r\nconstable, “what you have just said has no point for me, but a good deal\r\nfor those who were not so forward as I was in the lady’s good graces.”\r\n [At this period princes of the blood, when speaking to the king, said\r\nMonsieur; when they wrote to him, they called him Monseigneur.]  Francis\r\nI., to whom this scarcely veiled allusion referred, was content to reply,\r\n“Ah! my dear cousin, you fly out at everything, and you are mighty\r\nshort-tempered.”  The nickname of short-tempered stuck to the constable\r\nfrom that day, and not without reason.  With anybody but the king the\r\nconstable was a good deal more than short-tempered the chancellor,\r\nDuprat, who happened to be at Moulins, and who had a wish to become\r\npossessed of two estates belonging to the constable, tried to worm\r\nhimself into his good graces; but Bourbon gave him sternly to understand\r\nwith what contempt he regarded him, and Duprat, who had hitherto been\r\nmerely the instrument of Louise of Savoy’s passions, so far as the duke\r\nwas concerned, became henceforth his personal enemy, and did not wait\r\nlong for an opportunity of making the full weight of his enmity felt.\r\nThe king’s visit to Moulins came to an end without any settlement of\r\nthe debts due from the royal treasury to the constable.  Three years\r\nafterwards, in 1520, he appeared with not a whit the less magnificence\r\nat the Field of Cloth of Gold, where he was one of the two great lords\r\nchosen by Francis I. to accompany him at his interview with Henry VIII.;\r\nbut the constable had to put up with the disagreeableness of having for\r\nhis associate upon that state occasion Admiral Bonnivet, whom he had but\r\nlately treated with so much hauteur, and his relations towards the court\r\nwere by no means improved by the honor which the king conferred upon him\r\nin summoning him to his side that day.  Henry VIII., who was struck by\r\nthis vassal’s haughty bearing and looks, said to Francis I., “If I had a\r\nsubject like that in my kingdom, I would not leave his head very long on\r\nhis shoulders.”\r\n\r\nMore serious causes of resentment came to aggravate a situation already\r\nso uncomfortable.  The war, which had been a-hatching ever since the\r\nimperial election at Frankfort, burst out in 1521, between Francis I.\r\nand Charles V.  Francis raised four armies in order to face it on all his\r\nfrontiers, in Guienne, in Burgundy, in Champagne, and in Picardy, “where\r\nthere was no army,” says Du Bellai, “however small.”  None of these great\r\ncommands was given to the Duke of Bourbon; and when the king summoned him\r\nto the army of Picardy, whither he repaired in all haste with six\r\nthousand foot and three hundred men-at-arms raised in his own states,\r\nthe command of the advance-guard, which belonged to him by right of his\r\nconstableship, was given to the Duke of Alencon, who had nothing to\r\nrecommend him beyond the fact that he was the husband of Marguerite de\r\nValois and brother-in-law of the king.  Bourbon deeply resented this\r\nslight; and it was remarked that he frequently quoted with peculiar\r\nmeaning a reply made by a Gascon gentleman to King Charles VII., who had\r\nasked him if anything could shake his fidelity, “Nothing, sir, nothing;\r\nnot even an offer of three such kingdoms as yours; but an affront might.”\r\n The constable did not serve a whit the less valiantly and brilliantly in\r\nthis campaign of Picardy; he surprised and carried the town of Hesdin,\r\nwhich was defended by a strong garrison; but after the victory he treated\r\nwith a generosity which was not perhaps free from calculation the\r\nimperialist nobility shut up in the castle; he set all his prisoners at\r\nlarge, and paid particular attention to the Countess de Roeux, of the\r\nhouse of Croy, whom he knew to have influence with Charles V.  He was\r\ncertainly not preparing just then to abandon the King of France and go\r\nover to the camp of the emperor; but he was sufficiently irritated\r\nagainst Francis I. to gladly seize an opportunity of making new friends\r\non the rival side.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there occurred the event which was to decide his conduct and\r\nhis destiny.  His wife, Suzanne of Bourbon, died at Chatellerault, in\r\nApril, 1521, after having lost the son whose birth had been celebrated\r\nwith such brilliancy at Moulins, and having confirmed by her will the\r\nsettlement upon her husband of all her possessions, which had already\r\nbeen conferred upon him by their marriage contract.  From whom came the\r\nfirst idea of the proposal to which this death was ere long to lead?  Was\r\nit the chancellor, Duprat, who told the mother of Francis I. that the\r\nwill and the settlement might be disputed at law, and that she would then\r\nenter into possession of a great part of what belonged to the House of\r\nBourbon?  Was it Louise of Savoy herself who conceived the hope of\r\nsatisfying at one and the same time her cupidity and the passion she felt\r\nfor the constable, by having an offer made to him of her hand, with the\r\nretention secured to him of those great possessions which, otherwise,\r\nwould be disputed, and which a decree of Parliament might take away from\r\nhim?  Between these two explanations of what occurred at that time, there\r\nis no certain choice afforded by historical documents; but the more\r\nreasonable conviction is, that the passion of Louise of Savoy was the\r\nfirst and the decisive cause of the proposal made to the constable.  He\r\nwas then thirty years old; Louise of Savoy was forty-five, but she was\r\nstill beautiful, attractive, and puissant; she had given the constable\r\nunmistakable proofs of her inclination for him and of the influence which\r\nhis inclinations exercised over her: she might well flatter herself that\r\nhe would be attracted by the prospect of becoming the king’s step-father\r\nand almost a sharer in the kingly power, whilst retaining that of the\r\ngreat feudal lord.  The chancellor, Duprat, full of ability and\r\nservility, put all his knowledge, all his subtlety in argument, and all\r\nhis influence in the Parliament at the disposal of Madame Louise, who, as\r\na nearer relative than the constable, claimed the possessions left by his\r\nwife, Suzanne of Bourbon.  Francis I., in the name of the crown, and in\r\nrespect of the constable’s other possessions, joined his claims to those\r\nof his mother.  Thus the lawsuit with which the duke was threatened\r\naffected him in every part of his fortune.  It was in vain that more or\r\nless direct overtures, on behalf of Madame Louise and of the king\r\nhimself, were made to induce him to accept the bargain offered: his\r\nrefusal was expressed and given with an open contempt that verged upon\r\ncoarseness.  “I will never,” said he, “marry a woman devoid of modesty.”\r\n\r\nThe lawsuit was begun and prosecuted with all the hatred of a great lady\r\ntreated with contempt, and with all the knowingness of an unscrupulous\r\nlawyer eager to serve, in point of fact, his patroness, and to\r\ndemonstrate, in point of law, the thesis he had advanced.  Francis I.,\r\nvolatile, reckless, and ever helpless as he was against the passions of\r\nhis mother, who whilst she adored, beguiled him, readily lent himself to\r\nthe humiliation of a vassal who was almost his rival in puissance, and\r\ncertainly was in glory.  Three lawyers of renown entered upon the\r\nstruggle.  Poyet maintained the pretensions of the queen-mother; Lizet\r\ndeveloped Duprat’s argument in favor of the king’s claims; Montholon\r\ndefended the constable.  The Parliament granted several adjournments,\r\nand the question was in suspense for eleven months.  At last, in August,\r\n1523, the court interest was triumphant; Parliament, to get rid of direct\r\nresponsibility, referred the parties, as to the basis of the question, to\r\nthe king’s council; but it placed all the constable’s possessions under\r\nsequestration, withdrawing the enjoyment of them wholly from him.  A few\r\nyears afterwards Poyet became chancellor, and Lizet premier-president of\r\nParliament.  “Worth alone,” say the historians, “carved out for Montholon\r\nat a later period the road to the office of keeper of the seals.”\r\n\r\nThe constable’s fall and ruin were complete.  He at an early stage had a\r\npresentiment that such would be the issue of his lawsuit, and sought for\r\nsafeguards away from France.  The affair was causing great stir in\r\nEurope.  Was it, however, Charles V. who made the first overtures as the\r\nmost efficient supporter the constable could have?  Or was it the\r\nconstable himself who, profiting by the relations he had established\r\nafter the capture of Hesdin with the Croys, persons of influence with the\r\nemperor, made use of them for getting into direct communication with\r\nCharles V., and made offer of his services in exchange for protection\r\nagainst his own king and his own country?  In such circumstances and in\r\nthe case of such men the sources of crime are always surrounded with\r\nobscurity.  One is inclined to believe that Charles V., vigilant and\r\nactive as he was, put out the first feelers.  As soon as he heard that\r\nBourbon was a widower, he gave instructions to Philibert Naturelli, his\r\nambassador in France, who said, “Sir, you are now in a position to marry,\r\nand the emperor, my master, who is very fond of you, has a sister\r\ntouching whom I have orders to speak to you if you will be pleased to\r\nhearken.”  It was to Charles V.’s eldest sister, Eleanor, widow of Manuel\r\nthe Fortunate, King of Portugal, that allusion was made.  This overture\r\nled to nothing at the time; but the next year, in 1522, war was declared\r\nbetween Francis I. and Charles V.; the rupture between Francis I. and the\r\nDuke of Bourbon took place; the Bourbon lawsuit was begun; and the duke’s\r\nmother-in-law, Anne of France, daughter of Louis XI., more concerned for\r\nthe fate of her House than for that of her country, and feeling herself\r\nnear her end, said one day to her son-in-law, “My son, reflect that the\r\nHouse of Bourbon made alliance with the House of Burgundy, and that\r\nduring that alliance it always prospered.  You see at the present moment\r\nwhat is the state of our affairs, and the lawsuit in which you are\r\ninvolved is proceeded with only for want of alliances.  I do beg and\r\ncommand you to accept the emperor’s alliance.  Promise me to use thereto\r\nall the diligence you can, and I shall die more easy.”  She died on the\r\n14th of November, 1522, bequeathing all her possessions to the constable,\r\nwho was day by day more disposed to follow her counsels.  In the summer\r\nof 1522, he had, through the agency of Adrian de Croy, Lord of Beaurain,\r\nentered into negotiations not only with Charles V., but also with Henry\r\nVIII., King of England, deploring the ill behavior of Francis I. and the\r\nenormity of existing abuses, and proposing to set on foot in his own\r\npossessions a powerful movement for the reformation of the kingdom and\r\nthe relief of the poor people, if the two sovereigns would send “persons\r\nof trust and authority into the vicinity of his principality of Dombes,\r\nto Bourg-en-Bresse, whither he on his side would send his chancellor to\r\ncome to an agreement with them and act in common.”  In the month of\r\nMarch, 1523, whilst the foreign negotiations thus commenced and the\r\nhome-process against the constable were pursuing a parallel course,\r\nBourbon one day paid a visit to Queen Claude of France at the hour when\r\nshe was dining alone.  She was favorably disposed towards him, and would\r\nhave liked to get him married to her sister Renee, who subsequently\r\nbecame Duchess of Ferrara.  She made him sit down.  Francis I., who was\r\nat dinner in an adjacent room, came in.  Bourbon rose to take leave.\r\n“Nay, keep your seat,” said the king; “and so it is true that you are\r\ngoing to be married?”  “Not at all, sir.”  “O, but I know it; I am sure\r\nof it; I know of your dealings with the emperor.  And bear well in mind\r\nwhat I have to say to you on the subject.”  “Sir! is this a threat, pray?\r\nI have not deserved such treatment.”  After dinner he departed and went\r\nback to his hotel hard by the Louvre; and many gentlemen who happened to\r\nbe at court accompanied him by way of escort.  He was as yet a powerful\r\nvassal, who was considered to be unjustly persecuted.\r\n\r\nCharles V. accepted eagerly the overtures made to him by Bourbon in\r\nresponse to his own; but, before engaging in action, he wished to be\r\ncertified about the disposition of Henry VIII., King of England, and he\r\nsent Beaurain to England to take accurate soundings.  Henry at first\r\nshowed hesitation. When, Beaurain set before him all the advantages that\r\nwould accrue to their coalition from the Duke of Bourbon’s alliance: “And\r\nI,” said the king, brusquely, “what, pray, shall I get?” “Sir,” answered\r\nBeaurain, “you will be King of France.”  “Ah!” rejoined Henry, “it will\r\ntake a great deal to make M. de Bourbon obey me.”  Henry remembered the\r\ncold and proud bearing which the constable had maintained towards him at\r\nthe Field of Cloth of Gold.  He, nevertheless, engaged to supply half the\r\nexpenses and a body of troops for the projected invasion of France.\r\nCharles V.  immediately despatched Beaurain to the Duke of Bourbon, who\r\nhad removed to Montbrison, in the most mountainous part of his domains,\r\non pretext of a pilgrimage to Notre-Dame du Puy.  Beaurain was conducted\r\nthither, in great secrecy, on the 17th July, 1523, by two of the duke’s\r\ngentlemen, and passed two days there shut up in a room adjoining the\r\nconstable’s apartment, never emerging save at night to transact business\r\nwith him.  On the 18th of July, in the evening, he put into Bourbon’s\r\nhands his letters of credit, running thus: “My dear cousin, I send to you\r\nSieur de Beaurain, my second chamberlain.  I pray you to consider him as\r\nmyself, and, so doing, you will find me ever your good cousin and\r\nfriend.”  The negotiation was speedy.  Many historians have said that it\r\nwas confined to verbal conventions, and that there was nothing in writing\r\nbetween the two contracting parties.  That is a mistake.  A treaty was\r\ndrawn up in brief terms by Beaurain’s secretary, and two copies were\r\nmade, of which one was to be taken to Charles V.  and the other to be\r\nleft with the Duke of Bourbon.  It stipulated the mutual obligations of\r\nthe three contracting parties in their offensive and defensive league.\r\nBourbon engaged to attack Francis I. but he would not promise to\r\nacknowledge Henry VIII. as King of France.  “I am quite willing to be his\r\nally,” he said, “but his subject, his vassal, no!  All I can do is to\r\nleave myself, as to my relations towards him, in the emperor’s hands.”\r\n A strange and noble relic of patriotism in that violent and haughty soul,\r\nmore concerned for its rights than its duties, and driven to extremity by\r\nthe acts of ungrateful and unthoughtful injustice, to which the great\r\nlord and the valiant warrior had been subjected.  The treaty having been\r\nsigned with this reservation, Bourbon sent, about midnight, for\r\nSaint-Bonnet, Lord of Branon, whom he intended to despatch to Charles\r\nV., and, after having sworn him, “I send you,” said he, “to the emperor,\r\nto whom you will say that I commend myself humbly to his good graces,\r\nthat I beg him to give me his sister in marriage, and that, doing me\r\nthis honor, he will find me his servant, his good brother, and friend.”\r\n\r\nThe fatal step was taken.  Bourbon was now engaged in revolt against his\r\nking and his country, as well as in falsehood and treason--preliminary\r\nconditions of such a course.  He needed tools and accomplices; and though\r\nhe had a numerous and devoted following, he could not feel sure of them\r\nall for such a purpose.  The very day after the conclusion of his treaty\r\nwith Charles V., one of his most intimate and important confidants, John\r\nof Poitiers, Lord of St. Vallier, who was present at Montbrison during\r\nthe negotiation of the treaty, said to him in the morning, “Sir, it was\r\nyour wish; I heard all; and I spent the whole night thinking about it;\r\ntell me, I pray you, do you feel sure of your friend?”  “I was not more\r\nfond of the brother I lost at Melegnano,” said the constable; “I should\r\nnot have felt more sure of him.”  “Well, then,” rejoined St.  Vallier,\r\n“fancy that it is that brother who is speaking to you, and take in good\r\npart what he is about to say to you.  This alliance which is offered to\r\nyou will bring upon France the Germans, the Spaniards, and the English;\r\nthink of the great mischief which will ensue--human bloodshed,\r\ndestruction of towns, of good families and of churches, violation of\r\nwomen, and other calamities that come of war.  Reflect also on the great\r\ntreason you are committing; when the king has started for Italy and left\r\nyou in France, putting his trust in you, you will go and stab him in the\r\nback, and destroy him as well as his kingdom.  You belong to the House of\r\nFrance, and are one of the chief princes of the country, so beloved and\r\nesteemed by all that everybody is gladdened at the very sight of you.  If\r\nyou should come to be the cause of so great ruin, you will be the most\r\naccursed creature that ever was, accursed for a thousand years after your\r\ndeath.  For the love of God consider all this; and if you have no regard\r\nfor the king and Madame his mother, who, you say, are treating you\r\nwrongfully, at least have some regard for the queen and the princes her\r\nchildren, and do not wilfully cause the perdition of this kingdom, whose\r\nenemies, when you have let them into it, will drive you out of it\r\nyourself.”  “But, cousin,” said the constable, quite overcome, “what\r\nwould you have me to do?  The king and Madame mean to destroy me; they\r\nhave already taken away a part of my possessions.”  “Sir,” replied\r\nSaint-Vallier, “give up, I pray you, all these wicked enterprises; commend\r\nyourself to God, and speak frankly to the king.”  If we are to believe\r\nSaint-Vallier’s deposition, when, six months afterwards, he was put on\r\nhis trial and convicted for his participation in the plot and treason,\r\nthe constable was sufficiently affected by his representations to promise\r\nthat he would abandon his design and make his peace with the king: but\r\nfacts refute this assertion.  In the latter months of 1523, the\r\nstipulations of the treaty concluded at Montbrison on the 18th of July\r\nwere put into execution by all the contracting parties; letters of\r\nexchange from Henry VIII. were sent to Bale for the German lanzknechts he\r\nwas to pay; the lanzknechts crossed the Rhine on the 26th of August, and\r\nmarched through Franche-Comte in spite of its neutrality; the English\r\nlanded at Calais between the 23d and 30th of August, to co-operate with\r\nthe Flemings; the Spaniards began the campaign, on the 6th of September,\r\nin the direction of the Pyrenees; and the Duke, of Bourbon on his side\r\ntook all the necessary measures for forming a junction with his allies,\r\nand playing that part in the coalition which had been assigned to him.\r\n\r\nAccording to what appears, he had harbored a design of commencing his\r\nenterprise with a very bold stroke.  Being informed that Francis I. was\r\npreparing to go in person and wage war upon Italy, he had resolved to\r\ncarry him off on the road to Lyons, and, when once he had the king in his\r\nhands, he flattered himself he would do as he pleased with the kingdom.\r\nIf his attempt were unsuccessful, be would bide his time until Francis I.\r\nwas engaged in Milaness, Charles V. had entered Guienne, and Henry VIII.\r\nwas in Picardy: he would then assemble a thousand men-at-arms, six\r\nthousand foot and twelve thousand lanzknechts, and would make for the\r\nAlps to cut the king off from any communication with France.  This plan\r\nrested upon the assumption that the king would, as he had announced,\r\nleave the constable in France with an honorable title and an apparent\r\nshare in the government of the kingdom, though really isolated and\r\ndebarred from action.  But Francis had full cognizance of the details of\r\nthe conspiracy through two Norman gentlemen whom the constable had\r\nimprudently tried to get to join in it, and who, not content with\r\nrefusing, had revealed the matter at confession to the Bishop of Lisieux,\r\nwho had lost no time in giving information to Sire de Breze, grand\r\nseneschal of Normandy.  Breze at once reported it to the king, and his\r\nletter ran: “Sir, there is need also to take care of yourself, for there\r\nhas been talk of an attempt to carry you off between here and Lyons, and\r\nconduct you to a strong place in the Bourbon district or on the borders\r\nof Auvergne.”  Being at last seriously disquieted for the consequences of\r\nhis behavior towards the constable, Francis took two resolutions: one\r\nwas, not to leave him in France during his own absence; the other was,\r\nto go and see him at Moulins, at the same time taking all necessary\r\nprecautions for his own safety, and win him over once more by announcing\r\nan intention of taking him off to Italy and sharing with him the command\r\nof the army.  On approaching Moulins the king recalled the lanzknechts\r\nwho had already passed the town, entered it himself surrounded by his\r\nguards, and took up his quarters in the castle, of which he seized the\r\nkeys.  At his first interview with the constable, who was slightly\r\nindisposed and pretended to be very much so, “I know,” said he, “that you\r\nare keeping up a connection with the emperor, and that he is trying to\r\nturn your discontent to advantage, so as to beguile you; but I have faith\r\nin you; you are of the House of France and of the line of Bourbon, which\r\nhas never produced a traitor.”  “It is true, sir,” said the constable,\r\nwithout any confusion; “the emperor, informed by public rumor of the\r\nposition to which I am reduced, sent Beaurain to offer me an asylum in\r\nhis dominions and a fortune suitable to my birth and my rank; but I know\r\nthe value of empty compliments.  Hearing that your Majesty was to pass by\r\nMoulins, I thought it my duty to wait and disclose this secret to you\r\nmyself rather than intrust it to a letter.”  The king showed signs of\r\nbeing touched.  “I have an idea of taking you away with me to Italy,”\r\n said he: “would you come with me willingly?”  “Not only to Italy,” was\r\nthe answer, “but to the end of the world.  The doctors assure me that I\r\nshall soon be in a condition to bear the motion of a litter; I already\r\nfeel better; your Majesty’s kindnesses will soon complete my cure.”\r\n Francis testified his satisfaction.  Some of his advisers, with more\r\ndistrust and more prevision, pressed him to order the arrest of so\r\ndangerous a man, notwithstanding his protestations; but Francis refused.\r\nAccording to what some historians say, if he had taken off the\r\nsequestration laid upon the constable’s possessions, actually restored\r\nthem to him, as well as discharged the debts due to him and paid his\r\npensions, and carried him off to Italy, if, in a word, he had shown a\r\nbold confidence and given back to him at once and forever the whole of\r\nhis position, he would, perhaps, have weaned him from his plot, and would\r\nhave won back to himself and to France that brave and powerful servant.\r\nBut Francis wavered between distrust and hope; he confined himself to\r\npromising the constable restitution of his possessions if the decree of\r\nParliament was unfavorable to him; he demanded of him a written\r\nengagement to remain always faithful to him and to join him in Italy as\r\nsoon as his illness would allow him; and, on taking leave of him, left\r\nwith him one of his own gentlemen, Peter de Brentonniere, Lord of Warthy,\r\nwith orders to report to the king as to his health.  In this officer\r\nBourbon saw nothing more or less than a spy, and in the king’s promises\r\nnothing but vain words dependent as they were upon the issue of a lawsuit\r\nwhich still remained an incubus upon him.  He had no answer for words but\r\nwords; he undertook the engagements demanded of him by the king without\r\nconsidering them binding; and he remained ill at Moulins, waiting till\r\nevents should summon him to take action with his foreign allies.\r\n\r\nThis state of things lasted far nearly three weeks.  The king remained\r\nstationary at Lyons waiting for the constable to join him; and the\r\nconstable, saying he was ready to set out and going so far as to actually\r\nbegin his march, was doing his three leagues a day by litter, being\r\nalways worse one day than he was the day before.  Peter de Warthy, the\r\nofficer whom the king had left with him, kept going and coming from Lyons\r\nto Moulins and from Moulins to Lyons, conveying to the constable the\r\nking’s complaints and to the king the constable’s excuses, without\r\nbringing the constable to decide upon joining the king at Lyons and\r\naccompanying him into Italy, or the king upon setting out for Italy\r\nwithout the constable.  “I would give a hundred thousand crowns,” the\r\nking sent word to Bourbon, “to be in Lombardy.”  “The king will do well,”\r\n answered Bourbon, “to get there as soon as possible, for despatch is\r\nneedful beyond everything.”  When Warthy insisted strongly, the constable\r\nhad him called up to his bedside; and “I feel myself,” said he, “the\r\nmost unlucky man in the world not to be able to serve the king; but if I\r\nwere to be obstinate, the doctors who are attending me would not answer\r\nfor my life, and I am even worse than the doctors think.  I shall never\r\nbe in a condition to do the king service any more.  I am going back to my\r\nnative air, and, if I recover a day’s health, I will go to the king.”\r\n “The king will be terribly put out,” said Warthy; and he returned to\r\nLyons to report these remarks of the real or pretended invalid.  While he\r\nwas away, the constable received from England and Spain news which made\r\nhim enter actively upon his preparations; he heard at the same time that\r\nthe king was having troops marched towards Bourbonness so as to lay\r\nviolent hands on him if he did not obey; he, therefore, decided to go and\r\nplace himself in security in his strong castle of Chantelle, where he\r\ncould await the movements of his allies; he mounted his horse, did six\r\nleagues at one stretch, and did not draw bridle until he had entered\r\nChantelle.  Warthy speedily came and rejoined him.  He found the\r\nconstable sitting on his bed, dressed like an invalid and with his head\r\nenveloped in a night-cap.  “M. de Warthy,” said Bourbon, “you bring your\r\nspurs pretty close after mine.”  “My lord,” was the reply, “you have\r\nbetter ones than I thought.”  “Think you,” said Bourbon, “that I did not\r\nwell, having but a finger’s breadth of life, to put it as far out of the\r\nway as I could to avoid the king’s fury?”  “The king,” said Warthy, “was\r\nnever furious towards any man; far less would he be so in your case.”\r\n “Nay, nay,” rejoined the constable, “I know that the grand master and\r\nMarshal de Chabannes set out from Lyons with the archers of the guard and\r\nfour or five thousand lanzknechts to seize me; and that is what made me\r\ncome to this house whilst biding my time until the king shall be pleased\r\nto hear me.”  He demanded that the troops sent against him should be\r\nordered to halt till the morrow, promising not to stir from Chantelle\r\nwithout a vindication of himself.  “Whither would you go, my lord?” said\r\nWarthy: “if you wished to leave the kingdom, you could not; the king has\r\nprovided against that everywhere.”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” said Bourbon, “I have no wish to leave the kingdom; I have\r\nfriends and servants there.”  Warthy went away from Chantelle in company\r\nwith the Bishop of Autun, Chiverny, who was one of the constable’s most\r\ntrusted friends, and who was bearer to the king of a letter which ran\r\nthus: “Provided it please the king to restore to him his possessions, my\r\nlord of Bourbon promises to serve him well and heartily, in all places\r\nand at all times at which it shall seem good to him.  In witness whereof,\r\nhe has signed these presents, and begs the king to be pleased to pardon\r\nthose towards whom he is ill disposed on account of this business.\r\nCHARLES.”  In writing this letter the constable had no other object than\r\nto gain a little time, for, on bidding good by to the Bishop of Autun,\r\nhe said to him, “Farewell, my dear bishop; I am off to Carlat, and from\r\nCarlat I shall slip away with five or six horses on my road to Spain.”\r\n On the next day but one, indeed, the 8th of September, 1523, whilst the\r\nBishop of Autun was kept prisoner by the troops sent forward to\r\nChantelle, the constable sallied from it about one in the morning, taking\r\nwith him five-and-twenty or thirty thousand crowns of gold sewn up in\r\nfrom twelve to fifteen jackets, each of which was intrusted to a man in\r\nhis train.  For a month he wandered about Bourbonness, Auvergne,\r\nBurgundy, Beaujolais, Vienness, Languedoc, and Dauphiny, incessantly\r\nchanging his road, his comrades, his costume, and his asylum,\r\noccasionally falling in with soldiers of the king who were repairing to\r\nItaly, and seeking for some place whence he might safely concert with and\r\nact with his allies.  At last, in the beginning of October, he arrived at\r\nSaint-Claude, in Franche-Comte, imperial territory, and on the 9th of\r\nOctober he made his entry into Besancon, where there came to join him\r\nsome of his partisans who from necessity or accident had got separated\r\nfrom him, without his having been able anywhere in his progress to excite\r\nany popular movement, form any collection of troops, or intrench himself\r\nstrongly in his own states.  To judge from appearances, he was now but a\r\nfugitive conspirator, without domains and without an army.\r\n\r\nSuch, however, were his fame and importance as a great lord and great\r\nwarrior, that Francis I., as soon as he knew him to be beyond his reach\r\nand in a fair way to co-operate actively with his enemies, put off his\r\ndeparture for Italy, and “offered the redoubtable fugitive immediate\r\nrestitution of his possessions, reimbursement from the royal treasury of\r\nwhat was due to him, renewal of his pensions and security that they would\r\nbe paid him with punctuality.”  Bourbon refused everything.  “It is too\r\nlate,” he replied.  Francis I.’s envoy then asked him to give up the\r\nsword of constable and the collar of the order of St.  Michael.  “You\r\nwill tell the king,” rejoined Bourbon, “that he took from me the sword\r\nof constable on the day that he took from me the command of the\r\nadvance-guard to give it to M. d’Alencon.  As for the collar of his\r\norder, you will find it at Chantelle under the pillow of my bed.”\r\n Francis I., in order to win back Bourbon, had recourse to his sister, the\r\nDuchess of Lorraine [Renee de Bourbon, who had married, in 1515, Antony,\r\ncalled the Good, Duke of Lorraine, son of Duke Rend II. and his second\r\nwife, Philippine of Gueldres]: but she was not more successful.  After\r\nsounding him, she wrote to Francis I. that the duke her brother “was\r\ndetermined to go through with his enterprise, and that he proposed to\r\ndraw off towards Flanders by way of Lorraine with eighteen hundred horse\r\nand ten thousand foot, and form a junction with the King of England.”\r\n [M. Mignet, _Etude sur le Connetable de Bourbon, in the Revue des Deux\r\nMondes_ of January 15, 1854, and March 15 and April 1, 1858.]\r\n\r\nUnder such grave and urgent circumstances, Francis I. behaved on the one\r\nhand with more prudence and efficiency than he had yet displayed, and on\r\nthe other with his usual levity and indulgence towards his favorites.\r\nAbandoning his expedition in person into Italy, he first concerned\r\nhimself for that internal security of his kingdom, which was threatened\r\non the east and north by the Imperialists and the English, and on the\r\nsouth by the Spaniards, all united in considerable force and already in\r\nmotion.  Francis opposed to them in the east and north the young Count\r\nClaude of Guise, the first celebrity amongst his celebrated race, the\r\nveteran Louis de La Tremoille, the most tried of all his warriors, and\r\nthe Duke of Vendome, head of the younger branch of the House of Bourbon.\r\nInto the south he sent Marshal de Lautrec, who was more brave than\r\nsuccessful, but of proved fidelity.  All these captains acquitted\r\nthemselves honorably.  Claude of Guise defeated a body of twelve thousand\r\nlanzknechts who had already penetrated into Champagne; he hurled them\r\nback into Lorraine, and dispersed them beneath the walls of the little\r\ntown of Neufchateau, where the princesses and ladies of Lorraine, showing\r\nthemselves at the windows, looked on and applauded their discomfiture.\r\nLa Tremoille’s only forces were very inferior to the thirty-five thousand\r\nImperialists or English who had entered Picardy; but he managed to make\r\nof his small garrisons such prompt and skilful use that the invaders were\r\nunable to get hold of a single place, and advanced somewhat heedlessly to\r\nthe very banks of the Oise, whence the alarm spread rapidly to Paris.\r\nThe Duke of Vendome, whom the king at once despatched thither with a\r\nsmall body of men-at-arms, marched night and day to the assistance of the\r\nParisians, harangued the Parliament and Hotel de Ville vehemently on the\r\nconspiracy of the Constable de Bourbon, and succeeded so well in\r\nreassuring them that companies of the city militia eagerly joined his\r\ntroops, and the foreigners, in dread of finding themselves hemmed in,\r\njudged it prudent to fall back, leaving Picardy in a state of equal\r\nirritation and devastation.  In the south, Lautrec, after having made\r\nhead for three days and three nights against the attacks of a Spanish\r\narmy which had crossed the Pyrenees under the orders of the Constable of\r\nCastille, forced it to raise the siege and beat a retreat.  Everywhere,\r\nin the provinces as well as at the court, the feudal nobility, chieftains\r\nand simple gentlemen, remained faithful to the king; the magistrates and\r\nthe people supported the military; it was the whole nation that rose\r\nagainst the great lord, who, for his own purposes, was making alliance\r\nwith foreigners against the king and the country.\r\n\r\nIn respect of Italy, Francis I. was less wise and less successful.  Not\r\nonly did he persist in the stereotyped madness of the conquest of\r\nMilaness and the kingdom of Naples, but abandoning for the moment the\r\nprosecution of it in person, he intrusted it to his favorite, Admiral\r\nBonnivet, a brave soldier, alternately rash and backward, presumptuous\r\nand irresolute, who had already lost credit by the mistakes he had\r\ncommitted and the reverses he had experienced in that arena.  At the very\r\njuncture when Francis I. confided this difficult charge to Bonnivet, the\r\nConstable de Bourbon, having at last got out of France, crossed Germany,\r\nrepaired to Italy, and halted at Mantua, Piacenza, and Genoa; and, whilst\r\nwaiting for a reply from Charles V., whom he had informed of his arrival,\r\nhe associated with the leaders of the imperial armies, lived amongst the\r\ntroops, inoculated them with his own ardor as well as warlike views, and\r\nby his natural superiority regained, amongst the European coalition, the\r\nconsideration and authority which had been somewhat diminished by his\r\nill-success in his own country and his flight from it.  Charles V. was\r\nsome time about sending an answer; for, in his eyes also, Bourbon had\r\nfallen somewhat.  “Was it prudent,” says the historian of Bourbon\r\nhimself, “to trust a prince who, though born near the throne, had\r\nbetrayed his own blood and forsworn his own country?  Charles V. might no\r\ndoubt have insured his fidelity, had he given him in marriage Eleanor of\r\nAustria, who was already affianced to him; but he could not make up his\r\nmind to unite the destiny of a princess, his own sister, with that of a\r\nprince whose position was equally pitiable and criminal.  At last,\r\nhowever, he decided to name him his lieutenant-general in Italy; but he\r\nsurrounded him with so many colleagues and so much surveillance that he\r\nhad nothing to fear from his remorse and repentance.”  [_Histoire de la\r\nMaison de Bourbon,_ t. ii.  p. 531.] Bourbon, however, though thus placed\r\nin a position of perplexity and difficulty, was none the less an\r\nadversary with whom Bonnivet was not in a condition to cope.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before this was proved by facts.  The campaign of 1524 in\r\nItaly, brilliant as was its beginning, what with the number and the fine\r\nappearance of the troops under Bonnivet’s orders, was, as it went on,\r\nnothing but a series of hesitations, contradictory movements, blunders,\r\nand checks, which the army itself set down to its general’s account.\r\nBonnivet, during his investment of Milan, had posted Bayard with a small\r\ncorps in the village of Rebec.  “The good knight, who was never wont to\r\nmurmur at any commission given him, said, ‘Sir Admiral, you would send me\r\nto a village hard by the enemy, the which is without any fortress, and\r\nwould need four times so many men as I have, for to be in safety and to\r\nhold it.’  ‘Sir Bayard,’ said the admiral, ‘go in peace; on my faith I\r\npromise you that within three days I will send you plenty of men with you\r\nfor to hold Rebec, since I well know that it is not to be held with so\r\nfew men; but never you mind; there shall not a mouse get out of Milan\r\nwithout you have notice of it.’  And so much did he say of one sort and\r\nanother that the good knight, with great disgust, went away with the men\r\ntold off to him to his post in Rebec.  He wrote many times to the admiral\r\nthat he was in very dangerous plight, and that, if he would have them\r\nhold out long, he should send him aid; but he got no answer.  The enemies\r\nwho were inside Milan were warned that the good knight was in Rebec with\r\nvery little company; so they decided on a night to go and surprise and\r\ndefeat him.  And the good knight, who was ever on his guard, set nearly\r\nevery night half his men to watch and to listen, and himself passed two\r\nor three nights at it, in such sort that he fell ill, as much from\r\nmelancholy as from cold, and far more than he let it appear; howbeit he\r\nwas forced to keep his room that day.  When it came on towards night, he\r\nordered some captains who were with him to go on the watch.  They went,\r\nor made show of going; but, because it rained a little, back went all\r\nthose who were on the watch, save three or four poor archers, the which,\r\nwhen the Spaniards approached within bow-shot of the village, made no\r\nresistance, but took to flight, shouting, ‘Alarm alarm!’  The good\r\nknight, who in such jeopardy never slept but with his clothes on, rose at\r\nonce, had the bridle put on a charger that was already saddled, and went\r\noff with five or six men-at-arms of his, straight to the barrier whither\r\nincontinently came up Captain Lorges and a certain number of his foot,\r\nwho bore themselves mighty well.  The uproar was great and the alarm was\r\nhot.  Then said the good knight to Captain Lorges, ‘Lorges, my friend,\r\nthis is an unequal sort of game; if they pass this barrier we are cooked.\r\nI pray you, retire your men, keep the best order you can, and march\r\nstraight to the camp at Abbiate-Grasso; I, with the horse I have, will\r\nremain in the rear.  We must leave our baggage to the enemy; there is no\r\nhelp for it.  Save we the lives if possible.’ .  .  .  The enemy sought\r\non all sides for the good knight, but he had already arrived at\r\nAbbiate-Grasso, where he had some unpleasant words with the admiral;\r\nhowbeit, I will not make any mention of them; but if they had both lived\r\nlonger than they did live, they would probably have gone a little\r\nfarther.  The good knight was like to die of grief at the mishap that\r\nhad befallen him, even though it was not his fault; but in war there is\r\nhap and mishap more than in all other things.”  [_Histoire du bon\r\nChevalier sans Peur et sans Reproche,_ t. ii.  pp. 120-123. _Les Gestes\r\net la Vie du Chevalier Bayard,_ by Champier, pp. 171-174.]\r\n\r\nThe situation of the French army before Milan was now becoming more and\r\nmore, not insecure only, but critical.  Bonnivet considered it his duty\r\nto abandon it and fall back towards Piedmont, where he reckoned upon\r\nfinding a corps of five thousand Swiss who were coming to support their\r\ncompatriots engaged in the service of France.  Near Romagnano, on the\r\nbanks of the Sesia, the retreat was hotly pressed by the imperial army,\r\nthe command of which had been ultimately given by Charles V. to the\r\nConstable de Bourbon, with whom were associated the Viceroy of Naples,\r\nCharles de Lannoy, and Ferdinand d’Avalos, Marquis of Pescara, the most\r\nable amongst the Neapolitan officers.  On the 30th of April, 1524, some\r\ndisorder took place in the retreat of the French; and Bonnivet, being\r\nseverely wounded, had to give up the command to the Count of St. Pol and\r\nto Chevalier Bayard.  Bayard, last as well as first in the fight,\r\naccording to his custom, charged at the head of some men-at-arms upon the\r\nImperialists, who were pressing the French too closely, when he was\r\nhimself struck by a shot from an arquebuse, which shattered his reins.\r\n“Jesus, my God,” he cried, “I am dead!”  He then took his sword by the\r\nhandle, and kissed the cross-hilt of it as the sign of the cross, saying\r\naloud as he did so, “Have pity on me, O God, according to Thy great\r\nmercy” (Miserere mei, Deus, secundum magnam misericordiam tuam);\r\nthereupon he became incontinently quite pale, and all but fell; but he\r\nstill had heart enough to grasp the pommel of the saddle, and remained in\r\nthat condition until a young gentleman, his own house-steward, helped him\r\nto dismount and set him down under a tree, with his face to the enemy.\r\nThe poor gentleman burst into tears, seeing his good master so mortally\r\nhurt that remedy there was none; but the good knight consoled him gently,\r\nsaying, “Jacques, my friend, leave off thy mourning; it is God’s will to\r\ntake me out of this world; by His grace I have lived long therein, and\r\nhave received therein blessings and honors more than my due.  All the\r\nregret I feel at dying is that I have not done my duty so well as I\r\nought.  I pray you, Jacques, my friend, let them not take me up from this\r\nspot, for, when I move, I feel all the pains that one can feel, short of\r\ndeath, which will seize me soon.”  The Constable de Bourbon, being\r\ninformed of his wound, came to him, saying, “Bayard, my friend, I am sore\r\ndistressed at your mishap; there is nothing for it but patience; give not\r\nway to melancholy; I will send in quest of the best surgeons in this\r\ncountry, and, by God’s help, you will soon be healed.”  “My lord,”\r\n answered Bayard, “there is no pity for me; I die having done my duty; but\r\nI have pity for you, to see you serving against your king, your country,\r\nand your oath.”  Bourbon withdrew without a word.  The Marquis of Pescara\r\ncame passing by.  “Would to God, gentle Sir Bayard,” said he, “that it\r\nhad cost me a quart of my blood, without meeting my death, that I had\r\nbeen doomed not to taste meat for two years, and that I held you safe and\r\nsound my prisoner, for by the treatment I showed you, you should have\r\nunderstanding of how much I esteemed the high prowess that was in you.”\r\n He ordered his people to rig up a tent over Bayard, and to forbid any\r\nnoise near him, so that he might die in peace.  Bayard’s own gentlemen\r\nwould not, at any price, leave him.  “I do beseech you,” he said to them,\r\n“to get you gone; else you might fall into the enemy’s hands, and that\r\nwould profit me nothing, for all is over with me.  To God I commend ye,\r\nmy good friends; and I recommend to you my poor soul; and salute, I pray\r\nyou, the king our master, and tell him that I am distressed at being no\r\nlonger able to do him service, for I had good will thereto.  And to my\r\nlords the princes of France, and all my lords my comrades, and generally\r\nto all gentlemen of the most honored realm of France when ye see them.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Death of Bayard----76]\r\n\r\n“He lived for two or three hours yet.  There was brought to him a priest,\r\nto whom he confessed, and then he yielded up his soul to God; whereat all\r\nthe enemy had mourning incredible.  Five days after his death, on the 5th\r\nof May, 1524, Beaurain wrote to Charles V., ‘Sir, albeit Sir Bayard was\r\nyour enemy’s servant, yet was it pity of his death, for ‘twas a gentle\r\nknight, well beloved of every one, and one that lived as good a life as\r\never any man of his condition.  And in truth he fully showed it by his\r\nend, for it was the most beautiful that I ever heard tell of.’  By the\r\nchiefs of the Spanish army certain gentlemen were commissioned to bear\r\nhim to the church, where solemn service was done for him during two days.\r\nThen, by his own servitors was he carried into Dauphiny, and, on passing\r\nthrough the territory of the Duke of Savoy, where the body was rested, he\r\ndid it as many honors as if it had been his own brother’s.  When the news\r\nof his death was known in Dauphiny, I trow that never for a thousand\r\nyears died there gentleman of the country mourned in such sort.  He was\r\nborne from church to church, at first near Grenoble, where all my lords\r\nof the parliament court of Dauphiny, my lords of the Exchequer, pretty\r\nwell all the nobles of the country and the greater part of all the\r\nburgesses, townsfolk, and villagers came half a league to meet the body:\r\nthen into the church of Notre-Dame, in the aforesaid Grenoble, where a\r\nsolemn service was done for him; then to a house of _Minimes,_ which had\r\nbeen founded aforetime by his good uncle the bishop of Grenoble, Laurens\r\nAlment; and there he was honorably interred.  Then every one withdrew to\r\nhis own house; but for a month there was a stop put to festivals dances,\r\nbanquets, and all other pastimes.  ‘Las! they had good reason; for\r\ngreater loss could not have come upon the country.”  [_Histoire du bon\r\nChevalier sans Peur et sans Reproche,_ t. ii.  pp. 125-132.]\r\n\r\nIt is a duty and an honor for history to give to such lives and such\r\ndeaths, as remarkable for modesty as for manly worth, the full place\r\nwhich they ought to occupy in the memory of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe French army continued its retreat under the orders of the Count of\r\nSt. Pol, and re-entered France by way of Suza and Briancon.  It was\r\nFrancis I.’s third time of losing Milaness.  Charles V., enchanted at the\r\nnews, wrote on the 24th of May to Henry VIII., “I keep you advertised of\r\nthe good opportunity it has pleased God to offer us of giving a full\r\naccount of our common enemy.  I pray you to carry into effect on your\r\nside that which you and I have for a long while desired, wherein I for my\r\npart will exert myself with all my might.”  Bourbon proposed to the two\r\nsovereigns a plan well calculated to allure them.  He made them an offer\r\nto enter France by way of Provence with his victorious army, to\r\nconcentrate there all the re-enforcements promised him, to advance up the\r\nRhone, making himself master as he went of the only two strong places,\r\nMonaco and Marseilles, he would have to encounter, to march on Lyons from\r\nthe side on which that city was defenceless, and be in four months at\r\nParis, whether or no he had a great battle to deliver on the march.  “If\r\nthe king wishes to enter France without delay,” said he to Henry VIII.’s\r\nambassador, “I give his Grace leave to pluck out my two-eyes if I am not\r\nmaster of Paris before All Saints.  Paris taken, all the kingdom of\r\nFrance is in my power.  Paris in France is like Milan in Lombardy; if\r\nMilan is taken, the duchy is lost; in the same way, Paris taken, the\r\nwhole of France is lost.”  By this plan Bourbon calculated on arriving\r\nvictorious at the centre of France, in his own domains, and there\r\nobtaining, from both nobles and people, the co-operation that had failed\r\nhim at the outset of his enterprise.  The two sovereigns were eager to\r\nclose with the proposal of the Frenchman, who was for thus handing over\r\nto them his country; a new treaty was concluded between them on the 25th\r\nof May, 1524, regulating the conditions and means of carrying out this\r\ngrand campaign; and it was further agreed that Provence and Dauphiny\r\nshould be added to the constable’s old possessions, and should form a\r\nstate, which Charles V. promised to raise to a kingdom.  There was yet a\r\ndifficulty looming ahead.  Bourbon still hesitated to formally\r\nacknowledge Henry VIII. as King of France, and promise him allegiance.\r\nBut at last his resistance was overcome.  At the moment of crossing the\r\nfrontier into France, and after having taken the communion, he said to\r\nthe English ambassador, Sir Richard Pace, in the presence of four of his\r\ngentlemen, “I promise you, on my faith, to place the crown, with the help\r\nof my friends, on the head of our common master.”  But, employing a ruse\r\nof the old feudal times, the last gasp of a troubled conscience, Bourbon,\r\nwhilst promising allegiance to Henry VIII., persisted in refusing to do\r\nhim homage.  Sir Richard Pace none the less regarded the question as\r\ndecided; and, whilst urging Cardinal Wolsey to act swiftly and resolutely\r\nin the interests of their master, he added, “If you do not pay regard to\r\nthese matters, I shall set down to your Grace’s account the loss of the\r\ncrown of France.”\r\n\r\nBourbon entered Provence on the 7th of July, 1524, with an army of\r\neighteen thousand men, which was to be joined before long by six or seven\r\nthousand more.  He had no difficulty in occupying Antibes, Frejus,\r\nDraguignan, Brignoles, and even Aix; and he already began to assume the\r\ntitle of Count of Provence, whilst preparing for a rapid march along by\r\nthe Rhone and a rush upon Lyons, the chief aim of the campaign; but the\r\nSpanish generals whom Charles V. had associated with him, and amongst\r\nothers the most eminent of them, the Marquis of Pescara, peremptorily\r\ninsisted that, according to their master’s order, he should besiege and\r\ntake Marseilles.  Charles V. cared more for the coasts of the\r\nMediterranean than for those of the Channel; he flattered himself that he\r\nwould make of Marseilles a southern Calais, which should connect Germany\r\nwith Spain, and secure their communications, political and commercial.\r\nBourbon objected and resisted; it was the abandonment of his general plan\r\nfor this war and a painful proof how powerless he was against the wishes\r\nof the two sovereigns, of whom he was only the tool, although they called\r\nhim their ally.  Being forced to yield, he began the siege of Marseilles\r\non the 19th of August.  The place, though but slightly fortified and ill\r\nsupplied, made an energetic resistance; the name and the presence of\r\nBourbon at the head of the besiegers excited patriotism; the burgesses\r\nturned soldiers; the cannon of the besiegers laid open their walls, but\r\nthey threw up a second line, an earthen rampart, called the ladies’\r\nrampart, because all the women in the city had worked at it.  The siege\r\nwas protracted; the re-enforcements expected by Bourbon did not arrive; a\r\nshot from Marseilles penetrated into Pescara’s tent, and killed his\r\nalmoner and two of his gentlemen.  Bourbon rushed up.  “Don’t you see?”\r\n said Pescara to him, ironically, “here are the keys sent to you by the\r\ntimid consuls of Marseilles.”  Bourbon resolved to attempt an assault;\r\nthe lanzknechts and the Italians refused; Bourbon asked Pescara for his\r\nSpaniards, but Pescara would only consent on condition that the breach\r\nwas reconnoitered afresh.  Seven soldiers were told off for this duty;\r\nfour were killed and the other three returned wounded, reporting that\r\nbetween the open breach and the intrenchment extended a large ditch\r\nfilled with fireworks and defended by several batteries.  The assembled\r\ngeneral officers looked at one another in silence.  “Well, gentlemen,”\r\n said Pescara, “you see that the folks of Marseilles keep a table well\r\nspread for our reception; if you like to go and sup in paradise, you are\r\nyour own masters so far; as for me, who have no desire to go thither just\r\nyet, I am off.  But believe me,” he added seriously, “we had best return\r\nto Milaness; we have left that country without a soldier; we might\r\npossibly find our return cut off.”  Whereupon Pescara got up and went\r\nout; and the majority of the officers followed him.  Bourbon remained\r\nalmost alone, divided between anger and shame.  Almost as he quitted this\r\nscene he heard that Francis I. was advancing towards Provence with an\r\narmy.  The king had suddenly decided to go to the succor of Marseilles,\r\nwhich was making so good a defence.  Nothing could be a bitterer pill for\r\nBourbon than to retire before Francis I., whom he had but lately promised\r\nto dethrone; but his position condemned him to suffer everything, without\r\nallowing him the least hesitation; and on the 28th of September, 1524, he\r\nraised the siege of Marseilles and resumed the road to Italy, harassed\r\neven beyond Toulon by the French advance-guard, eager in its pursuit of\r\nthe traitor even more than of the enemy.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this year, 1524, whilst Bourbon was wandering as a\r\nfugitive, trying to escape from his country, then returning to it, after\r\na few months, as a conqueror, and then leaving it again at the end of a\r\nfew weeks of prospective triumph, pursued by the king he had betrayed,\r\nhis case and that of his accomplices had been inquired into and disposed\r\nof by the Parliament of Paris, dispassionately and almost coldly,\r\nprobably because of the small esteem in which the magistrates held the\r\ncourt of Francis I., and of the wrong which they found had been done to\r\nthe constable.  The Parliament was not excited by a feeling of any great\r\ndanger to the king and the country; it was clear that, at the core, the\r\nconspiracy and rebellion were very circumscribed and impotent; and the\r\naccusations brought by the court party or their servants against the\r\nconspirators were laughable from their very outrageousness and\r\nunlikelihood; according to them, the accomplices of the constable meant\r\nnot only to dethrone, and, if need were, kill the king, but “to make pies\r\nof the children of France.”  Parliament saw no occasion to proceed\r\nagainst more than a half score of persons in confinement, and, except\r\nnineteen defaulters who were condemned to death together with\r\nconfiscation of their property, only one capital sentence was pronounced,\r\nagainst John of Poitiers, Lord of Saint-Vallier, the same who had exerted\r\nhimself to divert the constable from his plot, but who had nevertheless\r\nnot refrained from joining it, and was the most guilty of all the\r\naccomplices in consequence of the confidential post he occupied near the\r\nking’s person.  The decree was not executed, however; Saint-Vallier\r\nreceived his reprieve on the scaffold itself.  Francis I. was neither\r\nrancorous nor cruel; and the entreaties, or, according to some\r\nevil-speakers of the day, the kind favors, of the Lady de Brew,\r\nSaint-Vallier’s daughter and subsequently the celebrated Diana of\r\nPoitiers, obtained from the king her father’s life.\r\n\r\nFrancis I., greatly vexed, it is said, at the lenity of the Parliament of\r\nParis, summoned commissions chosen amongst the Parliaments of Rouen,\r\nDijon, Toulouse, and Bordeaux, and made them reconsider the case.  The\r\nprovincial Parliaments decided as that of Paris had.  The procedure\r\nagainst the principal culprit was several times suspended and resumed\r\naccording to the course of events, and the decree was not pronounced so\r\nlong as the Duke of Bourbon lived.  It was abroad and in his alliance\r\nwith foreign sovereigns that all his importance lay.\r\n\r\nAfter Bourbon’s precipitate retreat, the position of Francis I. was a\r\ngood one.  He had triumphed over conspiracy and invasion; the conspiracy\r\nhad not been catching, and the invasion had failed on all the frontiers.\r\nIf the king, in security within his kingdom, had confined himself to it,\r\nwhilst applying himself to the task of governing it well, he would have\r\nobtained all the strength he required to make himself feared and deferred\r\nto abroad.  For a while he seemed to have entertained this design: on the\r\n25th of September, 1523, he published an important ordinance for the\r\nrepression of disorderliness and outrages on the part of the soldiery in\r\nFrance itself; and, on the 28th of December following, a regulation as to\r\nthe administration of finances established a control over the various\r\nexchequer-officers, and announced the king’s intention of putting some\r\nlimits to his personal expenses, “not including, however,” said he, “the\r\nordinary run of our little necessities and pleasures.”  This singular\r\nreservation was the faithful exponent of his character; he was licentious\r\nat home and adventurous abroad, being swayed by his coarse passions and\r\nhis warlike fancies.  Even far away from Paris, in the heart of the\r\nprovinces, the king’s irregularities were known and dreaded.  In 1524,\r\nsome few weeks after the death [at Blois, July 20, 1524] of his wife,\r\nQueen Claude, daughter of Louis XII., a virtuous and modest princess more\r\nregretted by the people than by her husband, Francis made his entry into\r\nManosque, in Provence.  The burgesses had the keys of their town\r\npresented to him by the most beautiful creature they could find within\r\ntheir walls; it was the daughter of Antony Voland, one of themselves.\r\nThe virtuous young girl was so frightened at the king’s glances and the\r\nsigns he made to his gentry, evidently alluding to her, that, on\r\nreturning home, she got some burning sulphur and placed herself for a\r\nlong while under the influence of its vapor, in order to destroy the\r\nbeauty which made her run the risk of being only too pleasing to the\r\nking.  Francis, who was no great or able captain, could not resist the\r\ntemptations of war any more than those of the flesh.  When Bourbon and\r\nthe imperial army had evacuated Provence, the king loudly proclaimed his\r\npurpose of pursuing them into Italy, and of once more going forth to the\r\nconquest of Milaness, and perhaps also of the kingdom of Naples, that\r\nincurable craze of French kings in the sixteenth century.  In vain did\r\nhis most experienced warriors, La Tremoille and Chabannes, exert\r\nthemselves to divert him from such a campaign, for which he was not\r\nprepared; in vain did his mother herself write to him, begging him to\r\nwait and see her, for that she had important matters to impart to him.\r\nHe answered by sending her the ordinance which conferred upon her the\r\nregency during his absence; and, at the end of October, 1524, he had\r\ncrossed the Alps, anxious to go and risk in Milaness the stake he had\r\njust won in Provence against Charles V.\r\n\r\nArriving speedily in front of Milan, he there found the imperial army\r\nwhich had retired before him; there was a fight in one of the outskirts;\r\nbut Bourbon recognized the impossibility of maintaining a siege in a town\r\nof which the fortifications were in ruins, and with disheartened troops.\r\nOn the line of march which they had pursued, from Lodi to Milan, there\r\nwas nothing to be seen but cuirasses, arquebuses tossed hither and\r\nthither, dead horses, and men dying of fatigue and scarcely able to drag\r\nthemselves along.  Bourbon evacuated Milan, and, taking a resolution as\r\nbold as it was singular, abruptly abandoned, so far as he was personally\r\nconcerned, that defeated and disorganized army, to go and seek for and\r\nreorganize another at a distance.  Being informed that Charles III., Duke\r\nof Savoy, hitherto favorable to France, was secretly inclining towards\r\nthe emperor, he went to Turin, made a great impression by his confidence\r\nand his grand spirit in the midst of misfortune upon both the duke and\r\nhis wife, Beatrix of Portugal, and obtained from them not only a\r\nflattering reception, but a secret gift of their money and their jewelry;\r\nand, equipped with these resources, he passed into Germany to recruit\r\nsoldiers there.  The lanzknechts, who had formerly served under him in\r\nFrance, rushed to him in shoals; he had received from nature the gifts\r\nmost calculated to gain the hearts of campaigners: kind, accessible,\r\naffable and even familiar with the common soldier, he entered into the\r\ndetails of his wants and alleviated them.  His famous bravery, his\r\nfrankness, and his generosity gained over those adventurers who were\r\nweary of remaining idle; their affection consoled Bourbon and stood him\r\nin stead of all: his army became his family and his camp his country.\r\nProscribed and condemned in France, without any position secured to him\r\nin the dominions of Charles V., envied and crossed by that prince’s\r\ngenerals, he had found full need of all the strong tempering of his\r\ncharacter and of his warlike genius to keep him from giving way under so\r\nmany trials.  He was beginning to feel himself near recovery: he had an\r\narmy, an army of his own; he had chosen for it men inured to labor and\r\nfatigue, accustomed to strict discipline; and thereto he added five\r\nhundred horsemen from Franche-Comte for whose devotion and courage he\r\ncould answer: and he gave the second command in this army to George of\r\nFreundsberg, an old captain of lanzknechts and commandant of the\r\nemperor’s guard, the same who, three years before, on seeing Luther\r\nboldly enter Worms, said to him, with a slap on the shoulder, “Little\r\nmonk, this is a daring step thou art going to take!  Nor I, nor any\r\ncaptain of us, ever did the like.  If thy cause is good, and if thou have\r\nfaith in thy cause, forward! little monk, in God’s name forward!”  With\r\nsuch comrades about him, Bourbon re-entered Milaness at the head of\r\ntwelve or thirteen thousand fighting men, three months after having left\r\nit, alone and moneyless.  His rivals about the person of Charles V.,\r\nLannoy, Viceroy of Naples, and the Marquis of Pescara, could not help\r\nadmiring him, and he regained in the imperial camp an ascendency which\r\nhad but lately been very much shaken.\r\n\r\nHe found the fresh campaign begun in earnest.  Francis I.’s veteran\r\ngenerals, Marshals La Tremoille and Chabannes, had advised him to pursue\r\nwithout pause the beaten and disorganized imperial army, which was in\r\nsuch plight that there was placarded on the statue of Pasquin at Rome,\r\n“Lost--an army--in the mountains of Genoa; if anybody knows what has\r\nbecome of it, let him come forward and say: he shall be well rewarded.”\r\n If the King of France, it was said, drove back northward and forced into\r\nthe Venetian dominions the remnants of this army, the Spaniards would not\r\nbe able to hold their own in Milaness, and would have to retire within\r\nthe kingdom of Naples.  But Admiral Bonnivet, “whose counsel the king\r\nmade use of more than of any other,” says Du Bellay, pressed Francis I.\r\nto make himself master, before everything, of the principal strong places\r\nin Lombardy, especially of Pavia, the second city in the duchy of Milan.\r\nFrancis followed this counsel, and on the 26th of August, 1524, twenty\r\ndays after setting out from Aix in Provence, he appeared with his army in\r\nfront of Pavia.  On learning this resolution, Pescara joyously exclaimed,\r\n“We were vanquished; a little while and we shall be vanquishers.”  Pavia\r\nhad for governor a Spanish veteran, Antony de Leyva, who had\r\ndistinguished himself at the battle of Ravenna, in 1512, by his vigilance\r\nand indomitable tenacity: and he held out for nearly four months, first\r\nagainst assaults, and then against investment by the French army.\r\nFrancis I. and his generals occasionally proceeded during this siege to\r\nseverities condemned by the laws and usages of war.  A small Spanish\r\ngarrison had obstinately defended a tower situated at the entrance of a\r\nstone bridge which led from an island on the Ticino into Pavia.  Marshal\r\nde Montmorency at last carried the tower, and had all the defenders\r\nhanged “for having dared,” he said, “to offer resistance to an army of\r\nthe king’s in such a pigeon-hole.”  Antony de Leyva had the bridge\r\nforthwith broken down, and De Montmorency was stopped on the borders of\r\nthe Ticino.  In spite of the losses of its garrison in assaults and\r\nsorties, and in spite of the sufferings of the inhabitants from famine\r\nand from lack of resources of all sorts, Pavia continued to hold out.\r\nThere was a want of wood as well as of bread; and they knocked the houses\r\nto pieces for fuel.  Antony de Leyva caused to be melted down the vessels\r\nof the churches and the silvern chandeliers of the university, and even a\r\nmagnificent chain of gold which he habitually wore round his neck.  He\r\nfeared he would have to give in at last, for want of victuals and\r\nammunition, when, towards the end of January, 1525, he saw appearing, on\r\nthe northern side, the flags of the imperial army: it was Bourbon,\r\nLannoy, and Pescara, who were coming up with twenty thousand foot, seven\r\nhundred men-at-arms, a troop of Spanish arquebusiers, and several pieces\r\nof cannon.  Bourbon, whilst on the march, had written, on the 5th of\r\nJanuary, to Henry VIII., and, after telling him what he meant to do, had\r\nadded, “I know through one of my servants that the French have said that\r\nI retired from Provence shamefully.  I remained there a space of three\r\nmonths and eight days, waiting for battle.  I hope to give the world to\r\nknow that I have no fear of King Francis, for, please God, we shall place\r\nourselves so close together that we shall have great trouble to get\r\ndisentangled without battle, and I shall so do that neither he nor they\r\nwho have held such talk about me shall say that I was afraid of being\r\nthere.”  The situation was from that moment changed.  The French army\r\nfound themselves squeezed between the fortress which would not surrender\r\nand the imperial army which was coming to relieve it.  Things, however,\r\nremained stationary for three weeks.  Francis I. intrenched himself\r\nstrongly in his camp, which the Imperialists could not attack without\r\ngreat risk of unsuccess.  “Pavia is doomed to fall,” wrote Francis to his\r\nmother the regent on the 3d of February, “if they do not reenforce it\r\nsomehow; and they are beating about to make it hold on to the last gasp,\r\nwhich, I think, will not be long now, for it is more than a month since\r\nthose inside have had no wine to drink and neither meat nor cheese to\r\neat; they are short of powder even.”  Antony de Leyva gave notice to the\r\nImperialists that the town was not in a condition for further resistance.\r\nOn the other hand, if the imperial army put off fighting, they could not\r\nhelp breaking up; they had exhausted their victuals, and the leaders\r\ntheir money; they were keeping the field without receiving pay, and were\r\nsubsisting, so to speak, without resources.  The prudent Marquis of\r\nPescara himself was for bringing on a battle, which was indispensable.\r\n“A hundred years in the field,” said he, in the words of an old Italian\r\nproverb, “are better than one day of fighting, for one may lose in a\r\ndoubtful melley what one was certain of winning by skilful manoeuvres;\r\nbut when one can no longer keep the field, one must risk a battle, so as\r\nnot to give the enemy the victory without a fight.”  The same question\r\nwas being discussed in the French camp.  The veteran captains, La\r\nTremoille and Chabannes, were of opinion that by remaining in the strong\r\nposition in which they were encamped they would conquer without fighting.\r\nBonnivet and De Montmorency were of the contrary opinion.  “We French,”\r\n said Bonnivet, “have not been wont to make war by means of military\r\nartifices, but handsomely and openly, especially when we have at our head\r\na valiant king, who is enough to make the veriest dastards fight.  Our\r\nkings bring victory with them, as our little king Charles VIII. did at\r\nthe Taro, our king Louis XII. at Agnadello, and our king who is here\r\npresent at Melegnano.”  Francis I. was not the man to hold out against\r\nsuch sentiments and such precedents; and he decided to accept battle as\r\nsoon as it should be offered him.  The imperial leaders, at a council\r\nheld on the 23d of February, determined to offer it next day.  Bourbon\r\nvigorously supported the opinion of Pescara.\r\n\r\nAntony de Leyva was notified the same evening of their decision, and was\r\ninvited to make, as soon as he heard two cannon-shots, a sortie which\r\nwould place the French army between two fires.  Pescara, according to his\r\ncustom, mustered the Spaniards; and, “My lads,” said he, “fortune has\r\nbrought you to such extremity that on the soil of Italy you have for your\r\nown only that which is under your feet.  All the emperor’s might could\r\nnot procure for you to-morrow morning one morsel of bread.  We know not\r\nwhere to get it, save in the Frenchman’s camp, which is before your eyes.\r\nThere they have abundance of everything, bread, meat, trout and carp from\r\nthe Lake of Garda.  And so, my lads, if you are set upon having anything\r\nto eat tomorrow, march we down on the Frenchmen’s camp.”  Freundsberg\r\nspoke in the same style to the German lanzknechts.  And both were\r\nresponded to with cheers.  Eloquence is mighty powerful when it speaks in\r\nthe name of necessity.\r\n\r\nThe two armies were of pretty equal strength: they had each from twenty\r\nto five and twenty thousand infantry, French, Germans, Spaniards,\r\nlanzknechts, and Swiss.  Francis I. had the advantage in artillery and in\r\nheavy cavalry, called at that time the gendarmerie, that is to say, the\r\ncorps of men-at-arms in heavy armor with their servants; but his troops\r\nwere inferior in effectives to the Imperialists, and Charles V.’s two\r\ngenerals, Bourbon and Pescara, were, as men of war, far superior to\r\nFrancis I. and his favorite Bonnivet.  In the night between the 23d and\r\n24th of February they opened a breach of forty or fifty fathoms in the\r\nwall around the park of Mirabello, where the French camp was situated; a\r\ncorps immediately passed through it, marching on Pavia to re-enforce the\r\ngarrison, and the main body of the imperial army entered the park to\r\noffer the French battle on that ground.  The king at once set his army in\r\nmotion; and his well-posted artillery mowed down the corps of Germans and\r\nSpaniards who had entered the park.  “You could see nothing,” says a\r\nwitness of the battle, “but heads and arms flying about.”  The action\r\nseemed to be going ill for the Imperialists; Pescara urged the Duke of\r\nBourbon and Lannoy, the Viceroy of Naples, to make haste and come up;\r\nLannoy made the sign of the cross, and said to his men, “There is no hope\r\nbut in God; follow me and do every one as I do.”  Francis I., on his\r\nside, advanced with the pick of his men-at-arms, burst on the\r\nadvance-guard of the enemy, broke it, killed with his own hand the\r\nMarquis of Civita-San-Angelo, and dispersed the various corps he found in\r\nhis way.  In the confidence of his joy he thought the victory decided,\r\nand, turning to Marshal de Foix, who was with him, “M. de Lescun,” said\r\nhe, “now am I fain to call myself Duke of Milan.”  But Bourbon and\r\nPescara were not the men to accept a defeat so soon; they united all\r\ntheir forces, and resumed the offensive at all points; the French\r\nbatteries, masked by an ill-considered movement on the part of their own\r\ntroops, who threw themselves between them and the enemy, lost all\r\nserviceability; and Pescara launched upon the French gendarmerie fifteen\r\nhundred Basque arquebusiers, whom he had exercised and drilled to\r\npenetrate into the midst of the horses, shoot both horses and riders, and\r\nfall back rapidly after having discharged their pieces.  Being attacked\r\nby the German lanzknechts of Bourbon and Freundsberg, the Swiss in the\r\nFrench service did not maintain their renown, and began to give way.  “My\r\nGod, what is all this!” cried Francis I., seeing them waver, and he\r\ndashed towards them to lead them back into action; but neither his\r\nefforts, nor those of John of Diesbach and the Lord of Fleuranges, who\r\nwere their commanders, were attended with success.  The king was only\r\nthe more eager for the fray; and, rallying around him all those of his\r\nmen-at-arms who would neither recoil nor surrender, he charged the\r\nImperialists furiously, throwing himself into the thickest of the melley,\r\nand seeking in excess of peril some chance of victory; but Pescara,\r\nthough wounded in three places, was none the less stubbornly fighting on,\r\nand Antony de Leyva, governor of Pavia, came with the greater part of the\r\ngarrison to his aid.  At this very moment Francis I.  heard that the\r\nfirst prince of the blood, his brother-in-law the Duke of Alencon, who\r\ncommanded the rear-guard, had precipitately left the field of battle.\r\nThe oldest and most glorious warriors of France, La Tremoille, Marshal de\r\nChabannes, Marshal de Foix, the grand equerry San Severino, the Duke of\r\nSuffolk, Francis of Lorraine, Chaumont, Bussy d’Amboise, and Francis de\r\nDuras fell, here and there, mortally wounded.  At this sight Admiral\r\nBonnivet in despair exclaimed, “I can never survive this fearful havoc;”\r\n and raising the visor of his helmet, he rushed to meet the shots which\r\nwere aimed at him, and in his turn fell beside his comrades in arms.\r\nBourbon had expressly charged his men to search everywhere in the melley\r\nfor the admiral, and bring him in a prisoner.  When, as he passed along\r\nthat part of the battle-field, he recognized the corpse, “Ah! wretch,” he\r\ncried, as he moved away, “it is thou who hast caused the ruin of France\r\nand of me!”  Amidst these dead and dying, Francis still fought on;\r\nwounded as he was in the face, the arms, and the legs, he struck right\r\nand left with his huge sword, and cut down the nearest of his assailants;\r\nbut his horse, mortally wounded, dragged him down as it fell; he was up\r\nagain in an instant, and, standing beside his horse, he laid low two more\r\nSpaniards who were pressing him closely; the ruck of the soldiers crowded\r\nabout him; they did not know him, but his stature, his strength, his\r\nbravery, his coat of mail studded with golden lilies, and his helmet\r\novershadowed by a thick plume of feathers pointed him out to all as the\r\nfinest capture to make; his danger was increasing every minute, when one\r\nof Bourbon’s most intimate confidants, the Lord of Pomperant, who, in\r\n1523, had accompanied the constable in his flight through France, came up\r\nat this critical moment, recognized the king, and, beating off the\r\nsoldiers with his sword, ranged himself at the king’s side, represented\r\nto-him the necessity of yielding, and pressed him to surrender to the\r\nDuke of Bourbon, who was not far off.  “No,” said the king, “rather die\r\nthan pledge my faith to a traitor where is the Viceroy of Naples?”  It\r\ntook some time to find Lannoy; but at last he arrived and put one knee on\r\nthe ground before Francis I., who handed his sword to him.  Lannoy took\r\nit with marks of the most profound respect, and immediately gave him\r\nanother.  The battle was over, and Francis I. was Charles V.’s prisoner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Capture of Francis I.----91]\r\n\r\nHe had shown himself an imprudent and unskilful general, but at the same\r\ntime a hero.  His conquerors, both officers and privates, could not help,\r\nwhilst they secured his person, showing their admiration for him.  When\r\nhe sat down to table, after having had his wounds, which were slight,\r\nattended to, Bourbon approached him respectfully and presented him with a\r\ndinner-napkin; and the king took it without embarrassment and with frigid\r\nand curt politeness.  He next day granted him an interview, at which an\r\naccommodation took place with due formalities on both sides, but nothing\r\nmore.  All the king’s regard was for the Marquis of Pescara, who came to\r\nsee him in a simple suit of black, in order, as it were, to share his\r\ndistress.  “He was a perfect gentleman,” said Francis I., “both in peace\r\nand in war.”  He heaped upon him marks of esteem and almost of\r\nconfidence.  “How do you think,” he asked, “the emperor will behave to\r\nme?”  “I think,” replied Pescara, “I can answer for the emperor’s\r\nmoderation; I am sure that he will make a generous use of his victory.\r\nIf, however, he were capable of forgetting what is due to your rank, your\r\nmerits, and your misfortunes, I would never cease to remind him of it,\r\nand I would lose what little claim upon him my services may have given\r\nme, or you should be satisfied with his behavior.”  The king embraced him\r\nwarmly.  He asked to be excused from entering Pavia, that he might not be\r\na gazing-stock in a town that he had so nearly taken.  He was,\r\naccordingly, conducted to Pizzighittone, a little fortress between Milan\r\nand Cremona.  He wrote thence two letters, one to his mother the regent\r\nand the other to Charles V., which are here given word for word, because\r\nthey so well depict his character and the state of his mind in his hour\r\nof calamity:--\r\n\r\n     1.  “To the Regent of France: Madame, that you may know how stands\r\n     the rest of my misfortune: there is nothing in the world left to me\r\n     but honor and my life, which is safe.  And in order that, in your\r\n     adversity, this news might bring you some little comfort, I prayed\r\n     for permission to write you this letter, which was readily granted\r\n     me; entreating you, in the exercise of your accustomed prudence, to\r\n     be pleased not to do anything rash, for I have hope, after all, that\r\n     God will not forsake me.  Commending to you my children your\r\n     grandchildren, and entreating you to give the bearer a free passage,\r\n     going and returning, to Spain, for he is going to the emperor to\r\n     learn how it is his pleasure that I should be treated.”\r\n\r\n     2.  “To the Emperor Charles V.: If liberty had been sooner granted\r\n     me by my cousin the viceroy, I should not have delayed so long to do\r\n     my duty towards you, according as the time and the circumstances in\r\n     which I am placed require; having no other comfort under my\r\n     misfortune than a reliance on your goodness, which, if it so please,\r\n     shall employ the results of victory with honorableness towards me;\r\n     having steadfast hope that your virtue would not willingly constrain\r\n     me to anything that was not honorable; entreating you to consult\r\n     your own heart as to what you shall be pleased to do with me;\r\n     feeling sure that the will of a prince such as you are cannot be\r\n     coupled with aught but honor and magnanimity.  Wherefore, if it\r\n     please you to have so much honorable pity as to answer for the\r\n     safety which a captive King of France deserves to find, whom there\r\n     is a desire to render friendly and not desperate, you may be sure of\r\n     obtaining an acquisition instead of a useless prisoner, and of\r\n     making a King of France your slave forever.”\r\n\r\nThe former of these two letters has had its native hue somewhat altered\r\nin the majority of histories, in which it has been compressed into those\r\neloquent words, “All is lost save honor.”  The second needs no comment to\r\nmake apparent what it lacks of kingly pride and personal dignity.\r\nBeneath the warrior’s heroism there was in the qualities of Francis I.\r\nmore of what is outwardly brilliant and winning than of real strength and\r\nsolidity.\r\n\r\nBut the warrior’s heroism, in conjunction with what is outwardly\r\nbrilliant and winning in the man, exercises a great influence over\r\npeople.  The Viceroy of Naples perceived and grew anxious at the\r\npopularity of which Francis I. was the object at Pizzighittone.  The\r\nlanzknechts took an open interest in him and his fortunes; the Italians\r\nfixed their eyes on him; and Bourbon, being reconciled to him, might\r\nmeditate carrying him off.  Lannoy resolved to send him to Naples, where\r\nthere would be more certainty of guarding him securely.  Francis made no\r\nobjection to this design.  On the 12th of May, 1525, he wrote to his\r\nmother, “Madame, the bearer has assured me that he will bring you this\r\nletter safely; and, as I have but little time, I will tell you nothing\r\nmore than I shall be off to Naples on Monday--, and so keep a lookout at\r\nsea, for we shall have only fourteen galleys to take us and eighteen\r\nhundred Spaniards to man them; but those will be all their arquebusiers.\r\nAbove all, haste: for, if that is made, I am in hopes that you may soon\r\nsee your most humble and most obedient son.”  There was no opportunity\r\nfor even attempting to carry off the king as he went by sea to Naples;\r\ninstead of taking him to Naples, Lannoy transported him straight to\r\nSpain, with the full assent of the king and the regent themselves, for it\r\nwas in French galleys manned by Spanish troops that the voyage was made.\r\nInstead of awaiting the result of such doubtful chances of deliverance as\r\nmight occur in Italy, Francis I., his mother, and his sister Margaret,\r\nentertained the idea that what was of the utmost importance for him was\r\nto confer and treat in person with Charles V., which could not be done\r\nsave in Spain itself.  In vain did Bourbon and Pescara, whose whole\r\ninfluence and ambitious hopes lay in Italy, and who, on that stage,\r\nregarded Francis I. as their own prisoner rather than Charles V.’s, exert\r\nthemselves to combat this proposal; the Viceroy of Naples, in concert, no\r\ndoubt, with Charles V.  himself as well as with Francis I. and his\r\nmother, took no heed of their opposition; and Francis I., disembarking at\r\nthe end of June at Barcelona first and then at Valentia, sent, on the 2d\r\nof July, to Charles V. the Duke de Montmorency, with orders to say that\r\nhe had desired to approach the emperor, “not only to obtain peace and\r\ndeliverance in his own person, but also to establish and confirm Italy in\r\nthe state and fact of devotion to the emperor, before that the potentates\r\nand lords of Italy should have leisure to rally together in opposition.”\r\n The regent, his mother, and his sister Margaret congratulated him\r\nheartily on his arrival in Spain, and Charles V.  himself wrote to him,\r\n“It was a pleasure to me to hear of your arrival over here, because that,\r\njust now, it will be the cause of a happy general peace for the great\r\ngood of Christendom, which is what I most desire.”\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to understand how Francis I. and Charles V. could rely\r\nupon personal interviews and negotiations for putting an end to their\r\ncontentions and establishing a general peace.  Each knew the other’s\r\npretensions, and they knew how little disposed they were, either of them,\r\nto abandon them.  On the 28th of March, 1525, a month after the battle of\r\nPavia, Charles V. had given his ambassadors instructions as to treating\r\nfor the ransom and liberation of the King of France.  His chief\r\nrequirements were, that Francis I. should renounce all attempts at\r\nconquest in Italy, that he should give up the suzerainty of the\r\ncountships of Flanders and Artois, that he should surrender to Charles V.\r\nthe duchy of Burgundy with all its dependencies, as derived from Mary of\r\nBurgundy, daughter of the last duke, Charles the Rash; that the Duke of\r\nBourbon should be reinstated in possession of all his domains, with the\r\naddition thereto of Provence and Dauphiny, which should form an\r\nindependent state; and, lastly, that France should pay England all the\r\nsums of money which Austria owed her.  Francis I., on hearing, at\r\nPizzighittone, these proposals read out, suddenly drew his sword as if to\r\nstab himself, saying, “It were better for a king to end thus.”  His\r\ncustodian, Alancon, seized his arm, whilst recalling him to his senses.\r\nFrancis recovered calmness, but without changing his resolution; he would\r\nrather, he said, bury himself in a prison forever than subscribe to\r\nconditions destructive of his kingdom, and such as the States General of\r\nFrance would never accept.  When Francis I. was removed to Spain he had\r\nmade only secondary concessions as to these requirements of Charles V.,\r\nand Charles V. had not abandoned any one of his original requirements.\r\nMarshal de Montmorency, when sent by the king to the emperor on the 2d of\r\nJuly, 1525, did not enter at all into the actual kernel of the\r\nnegotiation; after some conventional protestations of a pacific kind, he\r\nconfined himself to demanding “a safe conduct for Madame Marguerite of\r\nFrance, the king’s only sister, Duchess of Alencon and Berry, who would\r\nbring with her such and so full powers of treating for peace, the\r\nliberation of the king, and friendly alliance to secure the said peace,\r\nthat the emperor would clearly see that the king’s intentions were pure\r\nand genuine, and that he would be glad to conclude and decide in a month\r\nwhat might otherwise drag on for a long while to the great detriment of\r\ntheir subjects.”  The marshal was at the same time to propose the\r\nconclusion of a truce during the course of the negotiations.\r\n\r\nAmongst the letters at that time addressed to Francis I., a prisoner of\r\nwar, is the following, dated March, 1525, when he was still in Italy:--\r\n\r\n     “My lord, the joy we are still feeling at the kind letters which you\r\n     were pleased to write yesterday to me and to your mother, makes us\r\n     so happy with the assurance of your health, on which our life\r\n     depends, that it seems to me that we ought to think of nothing but\r\n     of praising God and desiring a continuance of your good news, which\r\n     is the best meat we can have to live on.  And inasmuch as the\r\n     Creator bath given us grace that our trinity should be always\r\n     united, the other two do entreat you that this letter, presented to\r\n     you, who are the third, may be accepted with the same affection with\r\n     which it is cordially offered you by your most humble and most\r\n     obedient servants, your mother and sister--\r\n     LOUISE, MARGUERITE.”\r\n\r\nThis close and tender union of the three continued through all\r\nseparations and all trials; the confidence of the captive king was\r\nresponsive to the devotion of his mother the regent and of his sister who\r\nhad become his negotiatrix.  When the news came of the king’s captivity,\r\nthe regency threatened for a moment to become difficult and stormy; all\r\nthe ambition and the hatred that lay dormant in the court awoke; an\r\nattempt was made to excite in the Duke of Vendome, the head of the\r\nyounger branch of the House of Bourbon, a desire to take the regent’s\r\nplace; the Parliament of Paris attacked the chancellor, Duprat, whom they\r\nhated--not without a cause; but the Duke of Vendome was proof against the\r\nattempts which were made upon him, and frankly supported the regent,\r\nwho made him the chief of her council; and the regent supported the\r\nchancellor. She displayed, in these court-contentions, an ability\r\npartaking both of firmness and pliancy.  The difficulties of foreign\r\npolicy found her equally active and prudent.  The greatest peril which\r\nFrance could at that time incur arose from the maintenance of the union\r\nbetween the King of England and Charles V.  At the first news of the\r\nbattle of Pavia, Henry VIII. dreamed for a moment of the partition of\r\nFrance between Charles and himself, with the crown of France for his own\r\nshare; demonstrations of joy took place at the court of London; and\r\nattempts were made to levy, without the concurrence of Parliament,\r\nimposts capable of sufficing for such an enterprise.  But the English\r\nnation felt no inclination to put up with this burden and the king’s\r\narbitrary power in order to begin over again the Hundred Years’ War.\r\nThe primate, Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury, wrote to Cardinal Wolsey,\r\n“It is reported to me that when the people had orders to make bonfires\r\nfor the capture of the King of France, many folks said that it was more\r\nreason for weeping than for rejoicing.  Others openly expressed their\r\ndesire that the King of France might be set at liberty, that a happy\r\npeace might be concluded, and that the king might not attempt to conquer\r\nFrance again, a conquest more burdensome than profitable, and more\r\ndifficult to keep than to make.”  Wolsey himself was cooled towards\r\nCharles V., who, instead of writing to him as of old, and signing with\r\nhis own hand, “your son and cousin,” now merely put his name, Charles.\r\nThe regent, Louise of Savoy, profited ably by these feelings and\r\ncircumstances in England; a negotiation was opened between the two\r\ncourts; Henry VIII. gained by it two millions of crowns payable by annual\r\ninstalments of fifty thousand crowns each, and Wolsey received a pension\r\nof a hundred thousand crowns.  At first a truce for four months, and then\r\nan alliance, offensive and defensive, were concluded on the 30th of\r\nAugust, 1525, between France and England; and the regent, Louise of\r\nSavoy, had no longer to trouble herself about anything except the\r\ncaptivity of the king her son and the departure of her daughter Margaret\r\nto go and negotiate for the liberation of the prisoner.\r\n\r\nThe negotiation had been commenced, as early as the 20th of July, at\r\nToledo, between the ambassadors of Francis I. and the advisers of Charles\r\nV., but without any symptom of progress.  Francis I., since his arrival\r\nin Spain, had been taken from strong castle to strong castle, and then\r\nremoved to Madrid, everywhere strictly guarded, and leading a sad life,\r\nwithout Charles V.’s coming to visit him or appointing him any\r\nmeeting-place.  In vain did the emperor’s confessor, the Bishop of Osma,\r\nadvise him to treat Francis I. generously, and so lay upon him either the\r\nobligation of thankfulness or the burden of ingratitude; the majority of\r\nhis servants gave him contrary counsel.  “I know not what you mean to\r\ndo,” wrote his brother, the Archduke Ferdinand; “but, if I were wise\r\nenough to know how to give you good counsel, it seems to me that such an\r\nopportunity should not be lost, but that you should follow up your good\r\nfortune and act in such wise that neither the King of France nor his\r\nsuccessors should have power hereafter to do harm to you or yours.”\r\n That, too, was Charles V.’s own way of thinking; but, slow and patient\r\nas he was by nature, he relied upon the discomforts and the wearisomeness\r\nof prolonged captivity and indecision for tiring out Francis I. and\r\novercoming his resistance to the harsh conditions he would impose upon\r\nhim.  The regent, Louise, made him an offer to go herself and treat with\r\nhim, at Perpignan, for the king’s liberation; but he did not accept that\r\noverture.  The Duke of Alencon, son-in-law of Louise, had died at Lyons,\r\nunable to survive the shame of his flight at the battle of Pavia; and the\r\nregent hinted that her daughter Marguerite, three months a widow, “would\r\nbe happy if she could be agreeable to his Imperial Majesty,” but Charles\r\nlet the hint drop without a reply.  However, at the end of August, 1525,\r\nhe heard that Francis I. was ill: “from great melancholy he had fallen\r\ninto a violent fever.”  The population of Madrid was in commotion;\r\nFrancis I. had become popular there; many people went to pray for him in\r\nthe churches; the doctors told the emperor that there was fear for the\r\ninvalid’s life, and that he alone could alleviate the malady by\r\nadministering some hope.  Charles V. at once granted the safe-conduct\r\nwhich had been demanded of him for Marguerite of France, and on the 18th\r\nof September he himself went to Madrid to pay a visit to the captive.\r\nFrancis, on seeing him enter the chamber, said, “So your Majesty has come\r\nto see your prisoner die?”  “You are not my prisoner,” answered Charles,\r\n“but my brother and my friend: I have no other purpose than to give you\r\nyour liberty and every satisfaction you can desire.”  Next day Marguerite\r\narrived; her mother, the regent, had accompanied her as far as\r\nPont-Saint-Esprit; she had embarked, on the 27th of August, at\r\nAigues-Mortes, and, disembarking at Barcelona, had gone to Madrid by\r\nlitter; in order to somewhat assuage her impatience she had given\r\nexpression to it in the following tender stanzas:\r\n\r\n               “For the bliss that awaits me so strong\r\n               Is my yearning that yearning is pain;\r\n               One hour is a hundred years long;\r\n               My litter, it bears me in vain;\r\n               It moves not, or seems to recede;\r\n               Such speed would I make if I might:\r\n               O, the road, it is weary indeed,\r\n               Where lies--at the end--my delight!\r\n\r\n               “I gaze all around me all day\r\n               For some one with tidings to bring,\r\n               Not ceasing--ne’er doubt me--to pray\r\n               Unto God for the health of my king\r\n               I gaze; and when none is descried,\r\n               Then I weep; and, what else? if you ask,\r\n               To my paper my grief I confide\r\n               This, this is my sorrowful task.\r\n\r\n               “O, welcome be he who at length\r\n               Shall tap at my door and shall cry,\r\n               ‘The king to new health and new strength\r\n               Is returning; the king will not die!’\r\n               Then she, who were now better dead,\r\n               Will run, the news-bearer to see,\r\n               And kiss him for what he hath said,\r\n               That her brother from danger is free.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFrancis was not “free from danger” when his sister arrived; she took her\r\npost at his side; on the 25th of September a serious crisis came on; and\r\nhe remained for some time “without speaking, or hearing, or seeing.”\r\n Marguerite had an altar set up in her chamber; and all the French, of the\r\nhousehold, great lords and domestics, knelt beside the sick man’s sister,\r\nand received the communion from the, hands of the Archbishop of Embrun,\r\nwho, drawing near the bed, entreated the king to turn his eyes to the\r\nholy sacrament.  Francis came out of his lethargy, and asked to\r\ncommunicate likewise, saying, “God will cure me, soul and body.”  He\r\nbecame convalescent, and on the 20th of October he was sufficiently\r\nrecovered for Marguerite to leave Madrid, and go and resume negotiations\r\nat Toledo, whither Charles V. had returned.\r\n\r\nThe day but one after her arrival she wrote to the king, “The emperor\r\ngave me courteous and kind reception, and, after coming to meet me at the\r\nentrance of this house, he used very kind and courteous language to me.\r\nHe desired that he and I should be alone in the same room, and one of my\r\nwomen to keep the door.  This evening I will send you word of what has\r\nbeen done; entreating you, my lord, to put on before Sieur Alancon (the\r\nking’s custodian) an air of weakness and weariness, for your debility\r\nwill strengthen me and will hasten my despatch, which seems to me slower\r\nthan I can tell you; as well for the sake of seeing you liberated, which\r\nyou will be by God’s help, as of returning and trying whether your dear\r\nhand can be of any use to you.”  Marguerite was impressed by the\r\ngood-will she discovered at the court of Toledo in respect of the King of\r\nFrance, his liberation, and the establishment of peace; she received from\r\nthe people in the streets, as well as from the great lords in their\r\nhouses, the most significant proofs of favor.  Charles V. took umbrage at\r\nit, and had the Duke of Infantado, amongst others, informed that, if he\r\nwished to please the emperor, neither he nor his sons must speak to\r\nMadame d’Alencon.  “But,” said she, “I am not tabooed to the ladies, to\r\nwhom I will speak double.”  She contracted a real intimacy with even the\r\nsister of Charles V., Eleanor, widow of the King of Portugal, whom\r\nCharles had promised to the Duke of Bourbon, and between whom and her\r\nbrother, King Francis, Marguerite set brewing a marriage, which was not\r\nlong deferred.  But, in spite of her successes at the court, and even in\r\nthe family of the emperor, Marguerite had no illusions touching the small\r\nchance of bringing her grand object of negotiation to a happy issue.\r\n“Every one tells me,” she wrote, “that he loves the king; but there is\r\nsmall experience of it.  .  .  .  If I had to do with good sort of\r\npeople, who understand what honor is, I would not care; but the contrary\r\nis the case.”  She did not lose courage, however: “she spoke to the\r\nemperor so bravely and courteously,” says Brantome, “that he was quite\r\nastounded, and she said still worse to those of his council, at which\r\nshe had audience; there she had full triumph of her good speaking and\r\nharanguing, with an easy grace in which she was not deficient; and she\r\ndid so well with her fine speaking that she made herself rather agreeable\r\nthan hateful or tiresome, that her reasons were found good and pertinent,\r\nand that she remained in high esteem with the emperor, his council, and\r\nhis court.”\r\n\r\nBut neither good and pertinent reasons, nor the charm of eloquence in the\r\nmouth of a pleasing and able woman, are sufficient to make head against\r\nthe passions and interests of the actors who are at a given moment in\r\npossession of the political arena; it needs time, a great deal of time,\r\nbefore the unjust or unreasonable requirements and determinations of a\r\npeople, a generation, and the chief of a state become acknowledged as\r\nsuch and abandoned.  At the negotiations entered upon, in 1525, between\r\nFrancis I. and Charles V., Francis I. was prompt in making large and\r\nunpalatable concessions: he renounced his pretensions, so far as Italy\r\nwas concerned, to the duchy of Milan, to Genoa, and to the kingdom of\r\nNaples; his suzerainty over the countships of Flanders and Artois, and\r\npossession of Hesdin and Tournay; he consented to reinstate Duke Charles\r\nof Bourbon in all his hereditary property and rights, and to pay three\r\nmillions of crowns in gold for his own ransom; but he refused to cede\r\nProvence and Dauphiny to the Duke of Bourbon as an independent state,\r\nand to hand over the duchy of Burgundy to Charles V., as heir of his\r\ngrandmother, Mary of Burgundy, only daughter of Charles the Rash.\r\nCharles V., after somewhat lukewarmly persisting, gave up the demand he\r\nhad made on behalf of the Duke of Bourbon, for having Provence and\r\nDauphiny erected into an independent state; but he insisted absolutely,\r\non his own behalf, in his claim to the duchy of Burgundy as a right and a\r\ncondition, sine qua non, of peace.  The question at the bottom of the\r\nnegotiations between the two sovereigns lay thus: the acquisition of\r\nBurgundy was for Charles V. the crowning-point of his victory and of his\r\npredominance in Europe; the giving up of Burgundy was for Francis I. a\r\nlasting proof of his defeat and a dismemberment of his kingdom: one would\r\nnot let his prisoner go at any price but this, the other would not\r\npurchase at this price even his liberty and his restoration to his\r\nfriends.  In this extremity Francis I. took an honorable and noble\r\nresolution; in October, 1525, he wrote to Charles V., “Sir, my brother,\r\nI have heard from the Archbishop of Embrun and my premier-president at\r\nParis of the decision you have expressed to them as to my liberation, and\r\nI am sorry that what you demand of me is not in my power.  But feeling\r\nthat you could not take a better way of telling me that you mean to keep\r\nme prisoner forever than by demanding of me what is impossible on my\r\npart, I have made up my mind to put up with imprisonment, being sure that\r\nGod, who knows that I have not deserved a long one, being a prisoner of\r\nfair war, will give me strength to bear it patiently.  And I can only\r\nregret that your courteous words, which you were pleased to address to me\r\nin my illness, should have come to nothing.”  [_Documents inedits sur\r\nl’Histoire de France.  Captivite du roi Francois I._, p. 384.]\r\n\r\nThe resolution announced in this letter led before long to the official\r\nact which was certain to be the consequence of it.  In November, 1525, by\r\nformal letters patent, Francis I., abdicating the kingship which he could\r\nnot exercise, ordered that his eldest son, the dauphin Francis, then\r\neight years old, should be declared, crowned, anointed, and consecrated\r\nMost Christian King of France, and that his grandmother, Louise of Savoy,\r\nDuchess of Angouleme, or, in default of her, his aunt Marguerite, Duchess\r\nof Alencon, should be regent of the kingdom: “If it should please God\r\nthat we should recover our personal liberty, and be able to proceed to\r\nthe government and conduct of our kingdom, in that case our most dear and\r\nmost beloved son shall quit and give up to us the name and place of king,\r\nall things re-becoming just as they were before our capture and\r\ncaptivity.”  The letters patent ordered the regent “to get together a\r\nnumber of good and notable personages from the three estates in all the\r\ndistricts, countries, and good towns of France, to whom, either in a body\r\nor separately, one after another, she should communicate the said will of\r\nthe king, as above, in order to have their opinion, counsel, and\r\nconsent.”  Thus, during the real king’s very captivity, and so, long as\r\nit lasted, France was again about to have a king whom the States General\r\nof France would be called upon to support with their counsels and\r\nadhesion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Louise of Savoy and Marguerite de Valois----102]\r\n\r\nThis resolution was taken and these letters patent prepared just at the\r\nexpiry of the safe-conduct granted to the Princess Marguerite, and,\r\nconsequently, just when she would have to return to France.  Charles V.\r\nwas somewhat troubled at the very different position in which he was\r\nabout to find himself, when he would have to treat no longer at Madrid\r\nwith a captive king, but at Paris with a young king out of his power and\r\nwith his own people about him.  Marguerite fully perceived his\r\nembarrassment.  From Toledo, where she was, she wrote to her brother,\r\n“After having been four days without seeing the emperor, when I went to\r\ntake leave I found him so gracious that I think he is very much afraid of\r\nmy going; those gentry yonder are in a great fix, and, if you will be\r\npleased to hold firm, I can see them coming round to your wishes.  But\r\nthey would very much like to keep me here doing nothing, in order to\r\npromote their own affairs, as you will be pleased to understand.”\r\n Charles V., in fact, signified to the king his desire that the\r\nnegotiations should be proceeded with at Madrid or Toledo, never ceasing\r\nto make protestations of his pacific intentions.  Francis I. replied\r\nthat, for his part, “he would not lay any countermand on the duchess,\r\nthat he would willingly hear what the emperor’s ambassadors had to say,\r\nbut that, if they did not come to any conclusion as to a peace and his\r\nown liberation, he would not keep his own ambassadors any longer, and\r\nwould send them away.”  Marguerite set out at the end of November; she at\r\nfirst travelled slowly, waiting for good news to reach her and stop her\r\non the road; but, suddenly, she received notice from Madrid to quicken\r\nher steps; according to some historians, it was the Duke of Bourbon who,\r\neither under the influence of an old flame or in order to do a service to\r\nthe king he had betrayed, sent word to the princess that Charles V.,\r\nuneasy about what she was taking with her to France, had an idea of\r\nhaving her arrested the moment her safe-conduct had expired.  According\r\nto a more probable version, it was Francis I. himself who, learning that\r\nthree days after Marguerite’s departure Charles V. had received a copy of\r\nthe royal act of abdication, at once informed his sister, begging her to\r\nmake all haste.  And she did so to such purpose that, “making four days’\r\njourney in one,” she arrived at Salces, in the Eastern Pyrenees, an hour\r\nbefore the expiry of her safe-conduct.  She no doubt took to her mother,\r\nthe regent, the details of the king’s resolutions and instructions; but\r\nthe act itself containing them, the letters patent of Francis I., had not\r\nbeen intrusted to her; it was Marshal de Montmorency who, at the end of\r\nDecember, 15225, was the first bearer of them to France.\r\n\r\nDid Francis I. flatter himself that his order to have his son the dauphin\r\ndeclared and crowned king, and the departure of his sister Marguerite,\r\nwho was going, if not to carry the actual text of the resolution, at any\r\nrate to announce it to the regent and to France, would embarrass Charles\r\nV. so far as to make him relax in his pretensions to the duchy of\r\nBurgundy and its dependencies?  There is nothing to show that he was\r\nallured by such a hope; any how, if it may have for a moment arisen in\r\nhis mind, it soon vanished.  Charles V. insisted peremptorily upon his\r\nrequirements; and Francis I. at once gave up his attitude of firmness,\r\nand granted, instead, the concession demanded of him, that is, the\r\nrelinquishment of Burgundy and its dependencies to Charles V., “to hold\r\nand enjoy with every right of supremacy until it hath been judged,\r\ndecided, and determined, by arbiters elected on the emperor’s part and\r\nour own, to whom the said duchy, countships, and other territories\r\nbelong.  .  .  .  And for guarantee of this concession, the dauphin, the\r\nking’s eldest son, and his second son, Henry, Duke of Orleans, or other\r\ngreat personages, to the number of twelve, should be sent to him and\r\nremain in his keeping as hostages.”  The regent, Louise, was not without\r\na hand in this determination of the king; her maternal affection took\r\nalarm at the idea of her son’s being for an indefinite period a prisoner\r\nin the hands of his enemy.  Besides, in that case, war seemed to her\r\ninevitable; and she dreaded the responsibility which would be thrown upon\r\nher.  Charles V., on his side, was essentially a prudent man; he disliked\r\nremaining, unless it were absolutely necessary, for a long while in a\r\ndifficult position.  His chancellor, Gattinera, refused to seal a treaty\r\nextorted by force and violated, in advance, by lack of good faith.\r\n“Bring the King of France so low,” he said, “that he can do you no harm,\r\nor treat him so well that he can wish you no harm, or keep him a\r\nprisoner: the worst thing you can do is to let him go half satisfied.”\r\n Charles V. persisted in his pacific resolution.  There is no knowing\r\nwhether he was tempted to believe in the reality of Francis I.’s\r\nconcession, and to regard the guarantees as seriously meant; but it is\r\nevident that Francis I. himself considered them a mere sham; for four\r\nmonths previously, on the 22d of August, 1525, at the negotiations\r\nentered into on this subject, he had taken care to deposit in the hands\r\nof his negotiators a nullifying protest “against all pacts, conventions,\r\nrenunciations, quittances, revocations, derogations, and oaths that he\r\nmight have to make contrary to his honor and the good of his crown, to\r\nthe profit of the said emperor or any other whosoever.”  And on the 13th\r\nof January, 1526, four weeks after having given his ambassadors orders\r\nto sign the treaty of Madrid containing the relinquishment of Burgundy\r\nand its dependencies, the very evening before the day on which that\r\ntreaty was signed, Francis I. renewed, at Madrid itself, and again placed\r\nin the hands of his ambassadors, his protest of the 22d of August\r\npreceding against this act, declaring “that it was through force and\r\nconstraint, confinement and length of imprisonment, that he had signed\r\nit, and that all that was contained in it was and should remain null and\r\nof no effect.”  We may not have unlimited belief in the scrupulosity of\r\nmodern diplomats; but assuredly they would consider such a policy so\r\nfundamentally worthless that they would be ashamed to practise it.  We\r\nmay not hold sheer force in honor; but open force is better than\r\nmendacious weakness, and less debasing for a government as well as for a\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n“As soon as the treaty of Madrid was signed, the emperor came to Madrid to\r\nsee the king; then they went, both in one litter, to see Queen Eleanor,\r\nthe emperor’s sister and the king of Portugal’s widow, whom, by the said\r\ntreaty, the king was to espouse before he left Spain, which he did.”\r\n [_Memoires de Martin Du Bellay,_ t. ii.  p. 15.]  After which Francis was\r\nescorted by Lannoy to Fontarabia, whilst, on the other hand, the regent\r\nLouise, and the king’s two sons who were to go as hostages to Spain, were\r\non their way to Bayonne.  A large bark was anchored in the middle of the\r\nBidassoa, the boundary of the two kingdoms, between Irun and Andaye.\r\nLannoy put the king on board, and received in exchange, from the hands of\r\nMarshal Lautrec, the little princes Francis and Henry.  The king gave his\r\nchildren his blessing, and reached the French side whilst they were being\r\nremoved to the Spanish; and as soon as he set foot on shore, he leaped\r\nupon a fine Turkish horse, exclaiming, as he started at a gallop for\r\nBayonne, where his mother and his sister awaited him, “So now I am king\r\nagain!”\r\n\r\nOn becoming king again, he fell under the dominion of three personal\r\nsentiments, which exercised a decisive influence upon his conduct, and,\r\nconsequently, upon the destiny of France joy at his liberation, a\r\nthirsting for revenge, we will not say for vengeance, to be wreaked on\r\nCharles V., and the burden of the engagement he had contracted at Madrid\r\nin order to recover his liberty, alternately swayed him.  From Bayonne he\r\nrepaired to Bordeaux, where he reassembled his court, and thence to\r\nCognac, in Saintonge, where he passed nearly three months, almost\r\nentirely abandoning himself to field-sports, galas, diversions, and\r\npleasures of every kind, as if to indemnify himself for the wearisomeness\r\nand gloom in which he had lived at Madrid.  “Age subdues the blood,\r\nadversity the mind, risks the nerve, and the despairing monarch has no\r\nhope but in pleasures,” says Tavannes in his Memoires: “such was Francis\r\nI., smitten of women both in body and mind.  It is the little circle of\r\nMadame d’Etampes that governs.”  One of the regent’s maids of honor, Anne\r\nd’Heilly, whom Frances I. made Duchess of Etampes, took the place of the\r\nCountess of Chateaubriant as his favorite.  With strange indelicacy\r\nFrancis demanded back from Madame de Chateaubriant the beautiful jewels\r\nof gold which he had given her, and which bore tender mottoes of his\r\nsister Marguerite’s composition.  The countess took time enough to have\r\nthe jewels melted down, and said to the king’s envoy, “Take that to the\r\nking, and tell him that, as he has been pleased to recall what he gave\r\nme, I send it back to him in metal.  As for the mottoes, I cannot suffer\r\nany one but myself to enjoy them, dispose of them, and have the pleasure\r\nof them.”  The king sent back the metal to Madame de Chateaubriant; it\r\nwas the mottoes that he wished to see again, but he did not get them.\r\n\r\nAt last it was absolutely necessary to pass from pleasure to business.\r\nThe envoys of Charles V., with Lannoy, the Viceroy of Naples, at their\r\nhead, went to Cognac to demand execution of the treaty of Madrid.\r\nFrancis waited, ere he gave them an answer, for the arrival of the\r\ndelegates from the estates of Burgundy, whom he had summoned to have\r\ntheir opinion as to the cession of the duchy.  These delegates, meeting\r\nat Cognac in June, 1527, formally repudiated the cession, being opposed,\r\nthey said, to the laws of the kingdom, to the rights of the king, who\r\ncould not by his sole authority alienate any portion of his dominions,\r\nand to his coronation-oath, which superseded his oaths made at Madrid.\r\nFrancis invited the envoys of Charles V. to a solemn meeting of his court\r\nand council present at Cognac, at which the delegates from Burgundy\r\nrepeated their protest.  Whilst availing himself of this declaration as\r\nan insurmountable obstacle to the complete execution of the treaty of\r\nMadrid, Francis offered to give two million crowns for the redemption of\r\nBurgundy, and to observe the other arrangements of the treaty, including\r\nthe relinquishment of Italy and his marriage with the sister of Charles\r\nV.  Charles formally rejected this proposal.  “The King of France,” he\r\nsaid, “promised and swore, on the faith of an honest king and prince,\r\nthat, if he did not carry out the said restitution of Burgundy, he would\r\nincontinently come and surrender himself prisoner to H. M. the emperor,\r\nwherever he might be, to undergo imprisonment in the place where the said\r\nlord the emperor might be pleased to order him, up to and until the time\r\nwhen this present treaty should be completely fulfilled and accomplished.\r\nLet the King of France keep his oath.”  [_Traite de Madrid,_ 14th of\r\nJanuary, 1526: art. vi.]\r\n\r\nHowever determined he was, at bottom, to elude the strict execution of\r\nthe treaty of Madrid, Francis was anxious to rebut the charge of perjury\r\nby shifting the responsibility on to the shoulders of the people\r\nthemselves and their representatives.  He did not like to summon the\r\nstates-general of the kingdom, and recognize their right as well as their\r\npower; but, after the meeting at Cognac, he went to Paris, and, on the\r\n12th of December, 1527, the Parliament met in state with the adjunct of\r\nthe princes of the blood, a great number of cardinals, bishops, noblemen,\r\ndeputies from the Parliaments of Toulouse, Bordeaux, Rouen, Dijon,\r\nGrenoble, and Aix, and the municipal body of Paris.  In presence of this\r\nassembly the king went over the history of his reign, his expeditions in\r\nItaly, his alternate successes and reverses, and his captivity.  “If my\r\nsubjects have suffered,” he said, “I have suffered with them.”  He then\r\ncaused to be read the letters patent whereby he had abdicated and\r\ntransferred the crown to his son the dauphin, devoting himself to\r\ncaptivity forever.  He explained the present condition of the finances,\r\nand what he could furnish for the ransom of his sons detained as\r\nhostages; and he ended by offering to return as a prisoner to Spain if no\r\nother way could be found out of a difficult position, for he acknowledged\r\nhaving given his word, adding, however, that he had thought it pledged\r\nhim to nothing, since it had not been given freely.\r\n\r\nThis last argument was of no value morally or diplomatically; but in his\r\nbearing and his language Francis I.  displayed grandeur and emotion.  The\r\nassembly also showed emotion; they were four days deliberating; with some\r\nslight diversity of form the various bodies present came to the same\r\nconclusion; and, on the 16th of December, 1527, the Parliament decided\r\nthat the king was not bound either to return to Spain or to execute, as\r\nto that matter, the treaty of Madrid, and that he might with full\r\nsanction and justice levy on his subjects two millions of crowns for the\r\nransom of his sons and the other requirements of the state.\r\n\r\nBefore inviting such manifestations Francis I. had taken measures to\r\nprevent them from being in vain.  Since the battle of Pavia and his\r\ncaptivity at Madrid the condition and disposition of Europe, and\r\nespecially of Italy, had changed.  From 1513 to 1523, three popes, Leo\r\nX., Adrian VI., and Clement VII. had occupied the Holy See.  Adrian VI.\r\nalone embraced the cause of Charles V., whose preceptor he had been; but\r\nhe reigned only one year, eight months, and five days; and even during\r\nthat short time he made only a timid use of his power on his patron’s\r\nbehalf.  His successor, Clement VII., was a Florentine and a Medici, and,\r\nconsequently, but little inclined to favor the emperor’s policy.  The\r\nsuccess of Charles V. at Pavia and the captivity of Francis I. inspired\r\nthe pope and all Italy with great dread of the imperial pretensions and\r\npredominance.  A league was formed between Rome, Florence, Venice, and\r\nMilan for the maintenance of Italian independence; and, as the pope was\r\nat its head, it was called the Holy League.  Secret messages and\r\ncommunications were interchanged between these Italian states, the regent\r\nLouise of Savoy at Paris, and King Henry VIII. in London, to win them\r\nover to this coalition, not less important, it was urged, for the\r\nsecurity of Europe than of Italy.  The regent of France and the King of\r\nEngland received these overtures favorably; promises were made on either\r\nside and a commencement was even made of preparations, which were hastily\r\ndisavowed both at Paris and in London, when Charles V. testified some\r\nsurprise at them.  But when Francis I. was restored to freedom and\r\nreturned to his kingdom, fully determined in his own mind not to execute\r\nthe treaty of Madrid, the negotiations with Italy became more full of\r\nmeaning and reality.  As early as the 22d of May, 1526, whilst he was\r\nstill deliberating with his court and Parliament as to how he should\r\nbehave towards Charles V. touching the treaty of Madrid, Francis I.\r\nentered into the Holy League with the pope, the Venetians, and the Duke\r\nof Milan for the independence of Italy; and on the 8th of August\r\nfollowing Francis I. and Henry VIII. undertook, by a special treaty, to\r\ngive no assistance one against the other to Charles V., and Henry VIII.\r\npromised to exert all his efforts to get Francis I.’s two sons, left as\r\nhostages in Spain, set at liberty.  Thus the war between Francis I. and\r\nCharles V., after fifteen months’ suspension, resumed its course.\r\n\r\nIt lasted three years in Italy, from 1526 to 1529, without interruption,\r\nbut also without result; it was one of those wars which are prolonged\r\nfrom a difficulty of living in peace rather than from any serious\r\nintention, on either side, of pursuing a clear and definite object.\r\nBourbon and Lannoy commanded the imperial armies, Lautrec the French\r\narmy.  Only two events, one for its singularity and the other for its\r\ntragic importance, deserve to have the memory of them perpetuated in\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Pavia and whilst Francis I. was a captive in Spain,\r\nBourbon, who had hitherto remained in Italy, arrived at Madrid on the\r\n13th of November, 1525, almost at the same time at which Marguerite de\r\nValois was leaving it for France.  Charles V. received the hero of Pavia\r\nwith the strongest marks of consideration and favor; and the Spanish army\r\nwere enthusiastic in their attachment to him.  Amongst the great Spanish\r\nlords there were several who despised him as a traitor to his king and\r\ncountry.  Charles V. asked the Marquis de Villena to give him quarters in\r\nhis palace.  “I can refuse the king nothing,” said the marquis; “but as\r\nsoon as the traitor is out of the house, I will fire it with my own hand;\r\nno man of honor could live in it any more.”  Holding this great and at\r\nthe same time doubtful position, Bourbon remained in Spain up to the\r\nmoment when the war was renewed between Francis I. and Charles V.  The\r\nlatter could not at that time dispense with his services in Italy for the\r\nonly soldier who could have taken his place there, the Marquis of\r\nPescara, had died at Milan on the 30th of November, 1525, aged\r\nthirty-six.  Charles V.  at once sent Bourbon to take the command of the\r\nimperial armies in Italy.  On arriving at Milan in July, 1527, Bourbon\r\nfound not only that town, but all the emperor’s party in Italy, in such a\r\nstate of disorder, alarm, and exhaustion as to render them incapable of\r\nany great effort.  In view of this general disturbance, Bourbon, who was\r\nas ambitious as able, and had become the chief of the great adventurers\r\nof his day, conceived the most audacious hopes.  Charles V. had promised\r\nhim the duchy of Milan; why should he not have the kingdom of Naples\r\nalso, and make himself independent of Charles V.?  He had immense\r\ninfluence over his Spanish army; and he had recruited it in Germany with\r\nfrom fourteen to fifteen thousand lanzknechts, the greater part of them\r\nLutherans, and right glad to serve Charles V., then at war with the pope.\r\nTheir commander, Freundsberg, a friend of Bourbon’s, had got made a\r\nhandsome gold chain, “expressly,” he said, “to hang and strangle the pope\r\nwith his own hand, because ‘honor to whom honor is due;’ and since the\r\npope called himself premier in Christendom, he must be deferred to\r\nsomewhat more than others.”  [Brantome, t. i.  p. 354.]  On the 30th of\r\nJanuary, 1527, at Piacenza, Bourbon, late Constable of France, put\r\nhimself at the head of this ruck of bold and greedy adventurers.  “I am\r\nnow,” said he to them, “nothing but a poor gentleman, who hasn’t a penny\r\nto call his own any more than you have; but, if you will have a little\r\npatience, I will make you all rich or die in the attempt;” and, so\r\nsaying, he distributed amongst them all he had left of money, rings, and\r\njewels, keeping for himself nothing but his clothes and a jacket of\r\nsilver tissue to put on over his armor.  “We will follow you everywhere,\r\nto the devil himself!” shouted the soldiers; “no more of Julius Caesar,\r\nHannibal, and Scipio!  Hurrah! for the fame of Bourbon!”  Bourbon led\r\nthis multitude through Italy, halting before most of the towns, Bologna\r\nand Florence even, which he felt a momentary inclination to attack, but,\r\nafter all, continuing his march until, having arrived in sight of Rome on\r\nthe 5th of March, 1527, in the evening, he had pitched his camp, visited\r\nhis guards, and ordered the assault for the morrow.  “The great chances\r\nof our destiny,” said he to his troops, “have brought us hither to the\r\nplace where we desired to be, after traversing so many bad roads, in\r\nmidwinter, with snows and frosts so great, with rain, and mud, and\r\nencounters of the enemy, in hunger and thirst, and without a halfpenny.\r\nNow is the time to show courage, manliness, and the strength of your\r\nbodies.  If this bout you are victorious, you will be rich lords and\r\nmighty well off; if not, you will be quite the contrary.  Yonder is the\r\ncity whereof, in time past, a wise astrologer prophesied concerning me,\r\ntelling me that I should die there; but I swear to you that I care but\r\nlittle for dying there, if, when I die, my corpse be left with endless\r\nglory and renown throughout the world.”  Afterwards he gave the word for\r\nretiring, some to rest, and some on guard, and for every one to be ready\r\nto assault on the morrow early.  .  .  .  “After that the stars became\r\nobscured by the greater resplendency of the sun and the flashing arms of\r\nthe soldiers who were preparing for the assault, Bourbon, clad all in\r\nwhite that he might be better known and seen (which was not the sign of a\r\ncoward), and armor in hand, marched in front close up to the wall, and,\r\nwhen he had mounted two rungs of his ladder, just as he had said the\r\nnight before, so did it happen to him, that envious, or, to more properly\r\nspeak, traitorous Fortune would have an arquebuse-shot to hit him full in\r\nthe left side and wound him mortally.  And albeit she took from him his\r\nbeing and his life, yet could she not in one single respect take away his\r\nmagnanimity and his vigor so long as his body had sense, as he well\r\nshowed out of his own mouth, for, having fallen when he was hit, he told\r\ncertain of his most faithful friends who were nigh him, and especially\r\nthe Gascon captain, Jonas, to cover him with a cloak and take him away,\r\nthat his death might not give occasion to the others to leave an\r\nenterprise so well begun.  .  .  .  Just then, as M. de Bourbon had\r\nrecommended,--to cover and hide his body,--so did his men; in such sort\r\nthat the escalade and assault went on so furiously that the town, after a\r\nlittle resistance, was carried; and the soldiers, having by this time got\r\nwind of his death, fought the more furiously that it might be avenged,\r\nthe which it certainly was right well, for they set up a shout of, ‘Slay,\r\nslay! blood, blood!  Bourbon, Bourbon!’” [Brantome, t. i.  pp. 262-269.]\r\n\r\nThe celebrated artist-in-gold, Benvenuto Cellini, says, in his Life\r\nwritten by himself, that it was he who, from the top of the wall of the\r\nCampo Santo at Rome, aiming his arquebuse at the midst of a group of\r\nbesiegers, amongst whom he saw one man mounted higher than the rest, hit\r\nhim, and that he then saw an extraordinary commotion around this man, who\r\nwas Bourbon, as he found out afterwards.  [_Vita di Benvenuto Cellini,_\r\nch. xvii.  pp. 157-159.]  “I have heard say at Rome,” says Brantome on\r\nthe contrary, “that it was held that he who fired that wretched\r\narquebuse-shot was a priest.”  [Brantome, t.  ii.  p.  268.]\r\n\r\nWhatever hand it was that shot down Bourbon, Rome, after his death, was\r\nplundered, devastated and ravaged by a brutal, greedy, licentious, and\r\nfanatical soldiery.  Europe was moved at the story of the sack of Rome\r\nand the position of the pope, who had taken refuge in the castle of St.\r\nAngelo.  Francis I. and Henry VIII. renewed their alliance; and a French\r\narmy under the command of Lautrec advanced into Italy.  Charles V.,\r\nfearing lest it should make a rapid march to Rome and get possession of\r\nthe pope whilst delivering him from captivity, entered into negotiations\r\nwith him; and, in consideration of certain concessions to the emperor,\r\nit was arranged that the pope should be set at liberty without delay.\r\nClement VII. was so anxious to get out of his position, lately so\r\nperilous and even now so precarious, that he slank out of the castle of\r\nSt. Angelo in the disguise of a tradesman the very night before the day\r\nfixed by the emperor for his liberation; and he retired to Orvieto, on\r\nthe territory occupied by the French army.  During this confusion of\r\nthings in Italy, Charles V. gave orders for arresting in Spain the\r\nambassadors of Francis I. and of Henry VIII., who were in alliance\r\nagainst him, and who, on their side, sent him two heralds-at-arms to\r\ndeclare war against him.  Charles V. received them in open audience at\r\nBurgos, on the 22d of January, 1528.  “I am very much astonished,” said\r\nhe to the French envoy, “to find the King of France declaring against me\r\na war which he has been carrying on for seven years; he is not in a\r\nposition to address to me such a declaration; he is my prisoner.  Why has\r\nhe taken no notice of what I said to his ambassador immediately after his\r\nrefusal to execute the treaty of Madrid?”  Charles V. now repeated, in\r\nthe very terms addressed to the French ambassador, the communication to\r\nwhich he alluded: “The king your master acted like a Bastard and a\r\nscoundrel in not keeping his word that he gave me touching the treaty of\r\nMadrid; if he likes to say to the contrary, I will maintain it against\r\nhim with my body to his.”  When these words were reported to Francis I.,\r\nhe summoned, on the 27th of March, 1528, the princes of the blood, the\r\ncardinals, the prelates, the grandees of the kingdom, and the ministers\r\nfrom foreign courts, and, after having given a vivid account of his\r\nrelations with Charles V., “I am not the prisoner of Charles,” he said:\r\n“I have not given him my word; we have never met with arms in our hands.”\r\n He then handed his herald, Guyenne, a cartel written with his own hand,\r\nand ending with these words addressed to Charles V.: “We give you to\r\nunderstand that, if you have intended or do intend to charge us with\r\nanything that a gentleman loving his honor ought not to do, we say that\r\nyou have lied in your throat, and that, as often as you say so, you will\r\nlie.  Wherefore for the future write us nothing at all; but appoint us\r\nthe time and place of meeting, and we will bring our sword for you to\r\ncross; protesting that the shame of any delay in fighting shall be yours,\r\nseeing that, when it comes to an encounter, there is an end of all\r\nwriting.”  Charles V. did not receive Francis I.’s challenge till the 8th\r\nof June; when he, in his turn, consulted the grandees of his kingdom,\r\namongst others the Duke of Infantado, one of the most considerable in\r\nrank and character, who answered him in writing: “The jurisdiction of\r\narms extends exclusively to obscure and foggy matters in which the\r\nordinary rules of justice are at a discount; but, when one can appeal to\r\noaths and authentic acts, I do not think that it is allowable to come to\r\nblows before having previously tried the ordinary ways of justice.  .  .\r\nIt seems to me that this law of honor applies to princes, however great\r\nthey may be, as well as to knights.  It would be truly strange, my lord,\r\nthat a debt so serious, so universally recognized, as that contracted by\r\nthe King of France, should be discharged by means of a personal\r\nchallenge.”  Charles V. thereupon sent off his herald, Burgundy, with\r\norders to carry to Francis I. “an appointment for a place of meeting\r\nbetween Fontarabia and Andaye, in such a spot as by common consent should\r\nbe considered most safe and most convenient by gentlemen chosen on each\r\nside;” and this offer was accompanied by a long reply which the herald\r\nwas at the same time to deliver to the King of France, whilst calling on\r\nhim to declare his intention within forty days after the delivery of that\r\nletter, dated the 24th of June, “in default whereof,” said Charles, “the\r\ndelay in fighting will be yours.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Francis I.----115]\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the frontier of France the Spanish herald demanded a\r\nsafe-conduct.  He was made to wait seven weeks, from the 30th of June to\r\nthe 19th of August, without the king’s cognizance, it is said.  At last,\r\non the 19th of September, 1528, Burgundy entered Paris, and was\r\nconducted to the palace.  Francis I. received him in the midst of his\r\ncourt; and, as soon as he observed the entrance of the herald, who made\r\nobeisance preliminary to addressing him, “Herald,” cried the king, “all\r\nthy letters declare that thou bringest appointment of time and place;\r\ndost thou bring it?”  “Sir,” answered the Spaniard, “permit me to do my\r\noffice, and say what the emperor has charged me to say.”  “Nay, I will\r\nnot listen to thee,” said Francis, “if thou do not first give me a\r\npatent signed by thy master, containing an appointment of time and\r\nplace.”  “Sir, I have orders to read you the cartel, and give it you\r\nafterwards.”  “How, pray!” cried the king, rising up angrily: “doth thy\r\nmaster pretend to introduce new fashions in my kingdom, and give me laws\r\nin my own court?”  Burgundy, without being put out, began again: “Sir,\r\n.  .  .  “  “Nay,” said Francis, “I will not suffer him to speak to me\r\nbefore he has given me appointment of time and place.  Give it me, or\r\nreturn as thou hast come.” “Sir, I cannot, without your permission, do\r\nmy office; if you will not deign to grant it to me, let me have your\r\nrefusal handed me, and your ratification I of my safe-conduct for my\r\nreturn.”  “I am quite willing,” said the king; “let him have it!”\r\n Burgundy set off again for Madrid, and the incident was differently\r\nreported by the two courts; but there was no further question of a duel\r\nbetween the two kings.\r\n\r\nOne would not think of attempting to decide, touching this question of\r\nsingle combat, how far sincerity was on the side of Francis or of\r\nCharles.  No doubt they were both brave; the former with more brilliancy\r\nthan his rival, the latter, at need, with quite as much firmness.  But in\r\nsending challenges one to the other, as they did on this occasion, they\r\nwere obeying a dying-out code, and rather attempting to keep up\r\nchivalrous appearances than to put seriously in practice the precedents\r\nof their ancestors.  It was no longer a time when the fate of a people\r\ncould be placed in the hands of a few valiant warriors, such as the three\r\nHoratii and the three Curiatii, or the thirty Bretons and thirty English.\r\nThe era of great nations and great contests was beginning, and one is\r\ninclined to believe that Francis I. and Charles V. were themselves aware\r\nthat their mutual challenges would not come to any personal encounter.\r\nThe war which continued between them in Italy was not much more serious\r\nor decisive; both sides were weary of it, and neither one nor the other\r\nof the two sovereigns espied any great chances of success.  The French\r\narmy was wasting itself, in the kingdom of Naples, upon petty,\r\ninconclusive engagements; its commander, Lautrec, died of the plague on\r\nthe 15th of August, 1528; a desire for peace became day by day stronger;\r\nit was made, first of all, at Barcelona, on the 20th of June, 1529,\r\nbetween Charles V. and Pope Clement VII.; and then a conference was\r\nopened at Cambrai for the purpose of bringing it about between Charles V.\r\nand Francis I. likewise.  Two women, Francis I.’s mother and Charles V.’s\r\naunt, Louise of Savoy and Margaret of Austria, had the real negotiation\r\nof it; they had both of them acquired the good sense and the moderation\r\nwhich come from experience of affairs and from difficulties in life; they\r\ndid not seek to give one another mutual surprises and to play-off one\r\nanother reciprocally; they resided in two contiguous houses, between\r\nwhich they had caused a communication to be made on the inside, and they\r\nconducted the negotiation with so much discretion, that the petty Italian\r\nprinces who were interested in it did not know the results of it until\r\npeace was concluded on the 5th of August, 1529.  Francis I. yielded on\r\nall the Italian and Flemish questions; and Charles V. gave up Burgundy,\r\nand restored to liberty the King of France’s two sons, prisoners at\r\nMadrid, in consideration of a ransom put at two millions of crowns and of\r\nhaving the marriage completed between his sister Eleanor and Francis I.\r\nKing Henry VIII. complained that not much account had been made of him,\r\neither during the negotiations or in the treaty; but his discontent was\r\nshort-lived, and he none the less came to the assistance of Francis I.\r\nin the money-questions to which the treaty gave rise.  Of the Italian\r\nstates, Venice was most sacrificed in this accommodation between the\r\nkings.  “The city of Cambrai,” said the doge, Andrew Gritti, “is the\r\npurgatory of the Venetians; it is the place where emperors and kings of\r\nFrance make the Republic expiate the sin of having ever entered into\r\nalliance with them.”  Francis went to Bordeaux to meet his sons and his\r\nnew wife.  At Bordeaux, Cognac, Amboise, Blois, and Paris, galas, both at\r\ncourt and amongst the people, succeeded one another for six months; and\r\nEurope might consider itself at peace.\r\n\r\nThe peace of Cambrai was called the ladies’ peace, in honor of the two\r\nprincesses who had negotiated it.  Though morally different and of very\r\nunequal worth, they both had minds of a rare order, and trained to\r\nrecognize political necessities, and not to attempt any but possible\r\nsuccesses.  They did not long survive their work: Margaret of Austria\r\ndied on the 1st of December, 1530, and Louise of Savoy on the 22d of\r\nSeptember, 1531.  All the great political actors seemed hurrying away\r\nfrom the stage, as if the drama were approaching its end.  Pope Clement\r\nVII. died on the 26th of September, 1534.  He was a man of sense and\r\nmoderation; he tried to restore to Italy her independence, but he forgot\r\nthat a moderate policy is, above all, that which requires most energy and\r\nperseverance.  These two qualities he lacked totally; he oscillated from\r\none camp to the other without ever having any real influence anywhere.  A\r\nlittle before his death he made France a fatal present; for, on the 28th\r\nof October, 1533, he married his niece Catherine de’ Medici to Francis\r\nI.’s second son, Prince Henry of Valois, who by the death of his elder\r\nbrother, the Dauphin Francis, soon afterwards became heir to the throne.\r\nThe chancellor, Anthony Duprat, too, the most considerable up to that\r\ntime amongst the advisers of Francis I., died on the 9th of July, 1535.\r\nAccording to some historians, when he heard, in the preceding year, of\r\nPope Clement VII.’s death, he had conceived a hope, being already\r\nArchbishop of Sens, and a cardinal, of succeeding him; and he spoke to\r\nthe king about it.  “Such an election would cost too dear,” said Francis\r\nI.; “the appetite of cardinals is insatiable; I could not satisfy it.”\r\n “Sir,” replied Duprat, “France will not have to bear the expense; I will\r\nprovide for it; there are four hundred thousand crowns ready for that\r\npurpose.”  “Where did you get all that money, pray?” asked Francis,\r\nturning his back upon him; and next day he caused a seizure to be made\r\nof a portion of the chancellor-cardinal’s property.  “This, then,”\r\n exclaimed Duprat, “is the king’s gratitude towards the minister who has\r\nserved him body and soul!”  “What has the cardinal to complain of?” said\r\nthe king: “I am only doing to him what he has so often advised me to do\r\nto others.”  [_Trois Magestrats Francais du Seizieme Siecle,_ by Edouard\r\nFaye de Brys, 1844, pp. 77-79.]  The last of the chancellor’s\r\nbiographers, the Marquis Duprat, one of his descendants, has disputed\r\nthis story.  [_Vie d’Antoine Duprat,_ 1857, p. 364.]  However that may\r\nbe, it is certain that Chancellor Duprat, at his death, left a very large\r\nfortune, which the king caused to be seized, and which he partly\r\nappropriated.  We read in the contemporary _Journal d’un Bourgeois de\r\nParis_ [published by Ludovic Lalanne, 1854, p. 460], “When the chancellor\r\nwas at the point of death, the king sent M. de Bryon, Admiral of France,\r\nwho had orders to have everything seized and all his property placed in\r\nthe king’s hands.  .  .  .  They found in his place at Nantouillet eight\r\nhundred thousand crowns, and all his gold and silver plate .  .  .  and\r\nin his Hercules-house, close to the Augustins’, at Paris, where he used\r\nto stay during his life-time, the sum of three hundred thousand livres,\r\nwhich were in coffers bound with iron, and which were carried off by the\r\nking for and to his own profit.”  In the civil as well as in the military\r\nclass, for his government as well as for his armies, Francis I. had, at\r\nthis time, to look out for new servants.\r\n\r\nHe did not find such as have deserved a place in history.  After the\r\ndeaths of Louise of Savoy, of Chancellor Duprat, of La Tremoille, of La\r\nPalice, and of all the great warriors who fell at the battle of Pavia, it\r\nwas still one more friend of Francis I.’s boyhood, Anne de Montmorency,\r\nwho remained, in council as well as army, the most considerable and the\r\nmost devoted amongst his servants.  In those days of war and discord,\r\nfraught with violence, there was no man who was more personally rough and\r\nviolent than Montmorency.  From 1521 to 1541, as often as circumstances\r\nbecame pressing, he showed himself ready for anything and capable of\r\nanything in defence of the crown and the re-establishment of order.  “Go\r\nhang me such a one,” he would say, according to Brantome.  “Tie you\r\nfellow to this tree; give yonder one the pike or arquebuse, and all\r\nbefore my eyes; cut me in pieces all those rascals who chose to hold such\r\na clock-case as this against the king; burn me this village; set me\r\neverything a-blaze, for a quarter of a league all round.”  In 1548,\r\na violent outbreak took place at Bordeaux on account of the gabel or\r\nsalt-tax; and the king’s lieutenant was massacred in it.  Anne de\r\nMontmorency, whom the king had made constable in 1538, the fifth of his\r\nfamily invested with that dignity, repaired thither at once.  “Aware of\r\nhis coming,” says Brantome, “MM. de Bordeaux went two days’ journey to\r\nmeet him and carry him the keys of their city: ‘Away, away,’ said he,\r\n‘with your keys; I will have nothing to do with them; I have others which\r\nI am bringing with me, and which will make other sort of opening than\r\nyours (meaning his cannon); I will have you all hanged; I will teach you\r\nto rebel against your king, and kill his governor and lieutenant.’  Which\r\nhe did not fail to do,” adds Brantome, “and inflicted exemplary\r\npunishment, but not so severe assuredly as the case required.”  The\r\nnarrator, it will be seen, was not more merciful than the constable.\r\nNor was the constable less stern or less thorough in battles than in\r\noutbreaks.  In 1562, at the battle of Dreux, he was aged and so ill that\r\nnone expected to see him on horseback.  “But in the morning,” says\r\nBrantome, “knowing that the enemy was getting ready, he, brimful of\r\ncourage, gets out of bed, mounts his horse, and appears at the moment the\r\nmarch began; whereof I do remember me, for I saw him and heard him, when\r\nM. de Guise came forward to meet him to give him good day, and ask how he\r\nwas.  He, fully armed, save only his head, answered him, ‘Right well,\r\nsir: this is the real medicine that hath cured me for the battle which is\r\ntoward and a-preparing for the honor of God and our king.’”  In spite of\r\nthis indomitable aptness for rendering the king everywhere the most\r\ndifficult, nay, the most pitiless services, the Constable de Montmorency\r\nnone the less incurred, in 1541, the disfavor of Francis I.; private\r\ndissensions in the royal family, the intrigues of rivals at court, and\r\nthe enmity of the king’s mistress, the Duchess of Etampes, effaced the\r\nremembrance of all he had done and might still do.  He did accept his\r\ndisgrace; he retired first to Chantilly, and then to Ecouen; and there he\r\nwaited for the dauphin, when he became King Henry II., to recall him to\r\nhis side and restore to him the power which Francis I., on his very\r\ndeath-bed, had dissuaded his son from giving back.  The ungratefulnesses\r\nof kings are sometimes as capricious as their favors.\r\n\r\nThe ladies’ peace, concluded at Cambrai in 1529, lasted up to 1536;\r\nincessantly troubled, however, by far from pacific symptoms, proceedings,\r\nand preparations.  In October, 1532, Francis I. had, at Calais, an\r\ninterview with Henry VIII., at which they contracted a private alliance,\r\nand undertook “to raise between them an army of eighty thousand men to\r\nresist the Turk, as true zealots for the good of Christendom.”  The\r\nTurks, in fact, under their great sultan, Soliman II., were constantly\r\nthreatening and invading Eastern Europe.  Charles V., as Emperor of\r\nGermany, was far more exposed to their attacks and far more seriously\r\ndisquieted by them than Francis I. and Henry VIII. were; but the peril\r\nthat hung over him in the East urged him on at the same time to a further\r\ndevelopment of ambition and strength; in order to defend Eastern Europe\r\nagainst the Turks he required to be dominant in Western Europe; and in\r\nthat very part of Europe a large portion of the population were disposed\r\nto wish for his success, for they required it for their own security.\r\n“To read all that was spread abroad hither and thither,” says William du\r\nBellay, “it seemed that the said lord the emperor was born into this\r\nworld to have fortune at his beck and call.”  Two brothers, Mussulman\r\npirates, known under the name of Barbarossa, had become masters, one of\r\nAlgiers and the other of Tunis, and were destroying, in the\r\nMediterranean, the commerce and navigation of Christian states.  It was\r\nCharles V. who tackled them.  In 1535 he took Tunis, set at liberty\r\ntwenty thousand Christian slaves, and remained master of the regency.\r\nAt the news of this expedition, Francis I., who, in concert with Henry\r\nVIII., was but lately levying an army to “offer resistance,” he said, “to\r\nthe Turk,” entered into negotiations with Soliman II., and concluded a\r\nfriendly treaty with him against what was called the common enemy.\r\nFrancis had been for some time preparing to resume his projects of\r\nconquest in Italy; he had effected an interview at Marseilles, in\r\nOctober, 1533, with Pope Clement VII., who was almost at the point of\r\ndeath, and it was there that the marriage of Prince Henry of France with\r\nCatherine de’ Medici was settled.  Astonishment was expressed that the\r\npope’s niece had but a very moderate dowry.  “You don’t see, then,” said\r\nClement VII.’s ambassador, “that she brings France three jewels of great\r\nprice, Genoa, Milan, and Naples?”  When this language was reported at the\r\ncourt of Charles V., it caused great irritation there.  In 1536 all\r\nthese combustibles of war exploded; in the month of February, a French\r\narmy entered Piedmont, and occupied Turin; and, in the month of July,\r\nCharles V. in person entered Provence at the head of fifty thousand men.\r\nAnne de Montmorency having received orders to defend southern France,\r\nbegan by laying it waste in order that the enemy might not be able to\r\nlive in it; officers had orders to go everywhere and “break up the\r\nbake-houses and mills, burn the wheat and forage, pierce the wine-casks,\r\nand ruin the wells by throwing the wheat into them to spoil the water.”\r\n In certain places the inhabitants resisted the soldiers charged with this\r\nduty; elsewhere, from patriotism, they themselves set fire to their\r\ncorn-ricks and pierced their casks.  Montmorency made up his mind to\r\ndefend, on the whole coast of Provence, only Marseilles and Arles; he\r\npulled down the ramparts of the other towns, which were left exposed to\r\nthe enemy.  For two months Charles V. prosecuted this campaign without a\r\nfight, marching through the whole of Provence an army which fatigue,\r\nshortness of provisions, sickness, and ambuscades were decimating\r\ningloriously.  At last he decided upon retreating.  “From Aix to Frejus,\r\nwhere the emperor at his arrival had pitched his camp, all the roads were\r\nstrewn with the sick and the dead pell-mell, with harness, lances, pikes,\r\narquebuses, and other armor of men and horses gathered in a heap.  I say\r\nwhat I saw,” adds Martin du Bellay, “considering the toil I had with my\r\ncompany in this pursuit.”  At the village of Mery, near Frejus, some\r\npeasants had shut themselves up in a tower situated on the line of march;\r\nCharles V. ordered one of his captains to carry it by assault; from his\r\nsplendid uniform the peasants, it is said, took this officer for the\r\nemperor himself, and directed their fire upon him; the officer, mortally\r\nwounded, was removed to Nice, where he died at the end of a few days.  It\r\nwas Garcilaso de la Vega, the prince of Spanish poesy, the Spanish\r\nPetrarch, according to his fellow-countrymen.  The tower was taken, and\r\nCharles V. avenged his poet’s death by hanging twenty-five of these\r\npatriot-peasants, being all that survived of the fifty who had maintained\r\nthe defence.\r\n\r\nOn returning from his sorry expedition, Charles V. learned that those of\r\nhis lieutenants whom he had charged with the conduct of a similar\r\ninvasion in the north of France, in Picardy, had met with no greater\r\nsuccess than he himself in Provence.  Queen Mary of Hungary, his sister\r\nand deputy in the government of the Low Countries, advised a local truce;\r\nhis other sister, Eleanor, the Queen of France, was of the same opinion;\r\nFrancis I. adopted it; and the truce in the north was signed for a period\r\nof three months.  Montmorency signed a similar one for Piedmont.  It was\r\nagreed that negotiations for a peace should be opened at Locate in\r\nRoussillon, and that, to pursue them, Francis should go and take up his\r\nquarters at Montpellier, and Charles V. at Barcelona.  Pope Paul III.\r\n(Alexander Farnese), who, on the 13th of October, 1534, had succeeded\r\nClement VII., came forward as mediator.  He was a man of capacity, who\r\nhad the gift of resolutely continuing a moderate course of policy, well\r\ncalculated to gain time, but insufficient for the settlement of great and\r\ndifficult questions.  The two sovereigns refused to see one another\r\nofficially; they did not like the idea of discussing together their\r\nmutual pretensions, and they were so different in character that, as\r\nMarguerite de Valois used to say, “to bring them to accord, God would have\r\nhad to re-make one in the other’s image.”  They would only consent to\r\ntreat by agents; and on the 15th of June, 1538, they signed a truce for\r\nten years, rather from weariness of a fruitless war than from any real\r\ndesire of peace; they, both of them, wanted time to bring them unforeseen\r\nopportunities for getting out of their embarrassments.  But for all their\r\nrefusal to take part in set negotiations, they were both desirous of\r\nbeing personally on good terms again, and to converse together without\r\nentering into any engagement.  Charles V. being forced by contrary winds\r\nto touch at the Island of Sainte-Marie, made a proposal to Francis I.\r\nfor an interview at Aigues Mortes; Francis repaired thither on the 14th\r\nof July, 1538, and went, the very same day, in a small galley, to pay a\r\nvisit to the emperor, who stepped eagerly forward, and held out a hand to\r\nhim to help him on to the other vessel.  Next day, the 15th of July,\r\nCharles V., embarking on board one of the king’s frigates, went and\r\nreturned the visit at Aigues-Mortes, where Francis, with his whole court,\r\nwas awaiting him; after disembarkation at the port they embraced; and\r\nQueen Eleanor, glad to see them together, “embraced them both,” says an\r\neyewitness, “a round the waist.”  They entered the town amidst the roar\r\nof artillery and the cheers of the multitude, shouting, “Hurrah! for the\r\nemperor and the king!”  The dauphin, Henry, and his brother Charles, Duke\r\nof Orleans, arriving boot and spur from Provence, came up at this moment,\r\nshouting likewise, “Hurrah! for the emperor and the king!”  “Charles V.\r\ndropped on his knees,” says the narrator, and embraced the two young\r\nprinces affectionately.  They all repaired together to the house prepared\r\nfor their reception, and, after dinner, the emperor, being tired, lay\r\ndown to rest on a couch.  Queen Eleanor, before long, went and tapped at\r\nhis door, and sent word to the king that the emperor was awake.  Francis,\r\nwith the Cardinal de Lorraine and the Constable de Montmorency, soon\r\narrived.  On entering the chamber, he found the emperor still lying down\r\nand chatting with his sister the queen, who was seated beside him on a\r\nchair.  At sight of the king Charles V. sprang from the couch and went\r\ntowards him without any shoes on.  “Well, brother,” said the king, “how\r\ndo you feel?  Have you rested well?”  “Yes,” said Charles; “I had made\r\nsuch cheer that I was obliged to sleep it off.”  “I wish you,” said\r\nFrancis, “to have the same power in France as you have in Flanders and in\r\nSpain;” whereupon he gave him, as a mark of affection, a diamond valued\r\nat thirty thousand crowns, and having on the ring in which it was set\r\nthis inscription: “A token and proof of affection” (Dilectionis testis\r\net exemplum).  Charles put the ring on his finger; and, taking from his\r\nneck the collar of the order (the Golden Fleece) he was wearing, he put\r\nit upon the king’s neck.  Francis did the converse with his own collar.\r\nOnly seven of the attendants remained in the emperor’s chamber; and there\r\nthe two sovereigns conversed for an hour, after which they moved to the\r\nhall, where a splendid supper awaited them.  After supper the queen went\r\nin person to see if the emperor’s room was ready; she came back to tell\r\nhim when it was, and Charles V. retired.  Next morning, July 16, Francis\r\nwent to see him again in his room; they heard mass together; Charles\r\nre-embarked the same day for Spain; Francis I. went and slept, on the\r\n17th, at Nimes; and thus ended this friendly meeting, which left, if not\r\nthe principal actors, at any rate the people all around, brimful of\r\nsatisfaction, and feeling sure that the truce concluded in the previous\r\nmonth would really at last be peace.  The people are easily deceived; and\r\nwhenever they are pleased with appearances they readily take them for\r\nrealities.\r\n\r\nAn unexpected event occurred to give this friendly meeting at\r\nAigues-Mortes a value which otherwise it would probably never have\r\nattained.  A year afterwards, in August, 1539, a violent insurrection\r\nburst out at Ghent.  The fair deputy of the Low Countries had obtained\r\nfrom the estates of Flanders a gratuitous grant of twelve hundred\r\nthousand florins for the assistance of her brother the emperor, whom his\r\nunfortunate expedition in Provence had reduced to great straits for want\r\nof money; and the city of Ghent had been taxed, for its share, to the\r\nextent of four hundred thousand florins.  The Ghentese pleaded their\r\nprivilege of not being liable to be taxed without their own consent.  To\r\ntheir plea Charles V. responded by citing the vote of the estates of\r\nFlanders and giving orders to have it obeyed.  The Ghentese drove out the\r\nofficers of the emperor, entered upon open rebellion, incited the other\r\ncities of Flanders, Ypres and Bruges amongst the rest, to join them, and,\r\ntaking even more decisive action, sent a deputation to Francis I., as\r\ntheir own lord’s suzerain, demanding his support, and offering to make\r\nhim master of the Low Countries if he would be pleased to give them\r\neffectual assistance.  The temptation was great; but whether it were from\r\nprudence or from feudal loyalty, or in consequence of the meeting at\r\nAigues-Mortes, and of the prospects set before him by Charles of an\r\narrangement touching Milaness, Francis rejected the offer of the\r\nGhentese, and informed Charles V. of it.  The emperor determined\r\nresolutely upon the course of going in person and putting down the\r\nGhentese; but how to get to Ghent?  The sea was not safe; the rebels had\r\nmade themselves masters of all the ports on their coasts; the passage by\r\nway of Germany was very slow work, and might be difficult by reason of\r\nill-will on the part of the Protestant states which would have to be\r\ntraversed.  France was the only direct and quick route.  Charles V. sent\r\nto ask Francis I.  for a passage, whilst thanking him for the loyalty\r\nwith which he had rejected the offers of the Ghentese, and repeating to\r\nhim the fair words that had been used as to Milaness.  Francis announced\r\nto his council his intention of granting the emperor’s request.  Some of\r\nhis councillors pressed him to annex some conditions, such, at the least,\r\nas a formal and written engagement instead of the vague and verbal\r\npromises at Aigues-Mortes.  “No,” said the king, with the impulsiveness\r\nof his nature, “when you do a generous thing, you must do it completely\r\nand boldly.”  On leaving the council he met his court-fool Triboulet,\r\nwhom he found writing in his tablets, called Fools’ Diary, the name of\r\nCharles V., “A bigger fool than I,” said he, “if he comes passing\r\nthrough France.”  “What wilt thou say, if I let him pass?” said the king.\r\n“I will rub out his name and put yours in its place.”  Francis I. was not\r\ncontent with letting Charles V.  pass; he sent his two sons, the dauphin\r\nand the Duke of Orleans, as far as Bayonne to meet him, went in person to\r\nreceive him at Chatellerault, and gave him entertainments at Amboise, at\r\nBlois, at Chambord, at Orleans, and Fontainebleau, and lastly at Paris,\r\nwhich they entered together on the 1st of January, 1540.  Orders had been\r\nsent everywhere to receive him “as kings of France are received on their\r\njoyous accession.”  “The king gave his guest,” says Du Bellay, “all the\r\npleasures that can be invented, as royal hunts, tourneys, skirmishes,\r\nfights a-foot and a-horseback, and in all other sorts of pastimes.”  Some\r\npetty incidents, of a less reassuring kind, were intermingled with these\r\nentertainments.  One day the Duke of Orleans, a young prince full of\r\nreckless gayety, jumped suddenly on to the crupper of the emperor’s\r\nhorse, and threw his arms round Charles, shouting, “Your Imperial Majesty\r\nis my prisoner.”  Charles set off at a gallop, without turning his head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Duke of Orleans and Charles V.----128]\r\n\r\nAnother day the king’s favorite, the Duchess of Etampes, was present with\r\nthe two monarchs.  “Brother,” said Francis, “you see yonder a fair dame\r\nwho is of opinion that I should not let you out of Paris without your\r\nhaving revoked the treaty of Madrid.”  “Ah! well,” said Charles, “if the\r\nopinion is a good one, it must be followed.”  Such freedom of thought and\r\nspeech is honorable to both sovereigns.  Charles V., impressed with the\r\nwealth and cheerful industry that met his eye, said, according to\r\nBrantome, “There is not in the world any greatness such as that of a King\r\nof France.”  After having passed a week at Paris he started for the Low\r\nCountries, halted at Chantilly, at the Constable de Montmorency’s, who,\r\nas well as the king’s two sons, the dauphin and the Duke of Orleans, was\r\nin attendance upon him, and did not separate from his escort of French\r\nroyalty until he arrived at Valenciennes, the first town in his Flemish\r\ndominions.  According to some historians there had been at Chantilly,\r\namongst the two young princes and their servants, some idea of seizing\r\nthe emperor and detaining him until he had consented to the concessions\r\ndemanded of him; others merely say that the constable, before leaving\r\nhim, was very urgent with him that he should enter into some positive\r\nengagement as to Milaness.  “No,” said Charles, “I must not bind myself\r\nany more than I have done by my words as long as I am in your power; when\r\nI have chastised my rebellious subjects I will content your king.”\r\n\r\nHe did chastise, severely, his Flemish subjects, but he did not content\r\nthe King of France.  Francis I. was not willing to positively renounce\r\nhis Italian conquests, and Charles V. was not willing to really give them\r\nup to him.  Milaness was still, in Italy, the principal object of their\r\nmutual ambition.  Navarre, in the south-east of France, and the Low\r\nCountries in the north, gave occasion for incessantly renewed disputes\r\nbetween them.  The two sovereigns sought for combinations which would\r\nallow them to make, one to the other, the desired concessions, whilst\r\nstill preserving pretexts for and chances of recovering them.  Divers\r\nprojects of marriage between their children or near relatives were\r\nadvanced with that object, but nothing came of them; and, after two years\r\nand a half of abortive negotiations, another great war, the fourth, broke\r\nout between Francis I. and Charles V., for the same causes and with the\r\nsame by-ends as ever.  It lasted two years, from 1542 to 1544, with\r\nalternations of success and reverse on either side, and several\r\ndiplomatic attempts to embroil in it the different European powers.\r\nFrancis I. concluded an alliance in 1543 with Sultan Soliman II., and, in\r\nconcert with French vessels, the vessels of the pirate Barbarossa cruised\r\nabout and made attacks upon the shores of the Mediterranean.  An outcry\r\nwas raised against such a scandal as this.  “Sir Ambassador,” said\r\nFrancis I. to Marino Giustiniano, ambassador from Venice, “I cannot deny\r\nthat I eagerly desire to see the Turk very powerful and ready for war;\r\nnot on his own account, for he is an infidel and all we are Christians,\r\nbut in order to cripple the power of the emperor, to force him into great\r\nexpense, and to give all other governments security against so great an\r\nenemy.”  “As for me,” says the contemporary Montluc in his Memoires, “if\r\nI could summon all the spirits of hell to break the head of my enemy who\r\nwould fain break mine, I would do it with all my heart, God forgive me!”\r\n On the other hand, on the 11th of February, 1543, Charles V. and Henry\r\nVIII., King of England, concluded an alliance against Francis I. and the\r\nTurks.  The unsuccess which had attended the grand expedition conducted\r\nby Charles V. personally in 1541, with the view of attacking Barbarossa\r\nand the Mussulmans in Algiers itself, had opened his eyes to all the\r\ndifficulty of such enterprises, and he wished to secure the co-operation\r\nof a great maritime power before engaging therein afresh.  He at the same\r\ntime convoked a German diet at Spires in order to make a strong\r\ndemonstration against the alliance between Francis I. and the Turks, and\r\nto claim the support of Germany in the name of Christendom.  Ambassadors\r\nfrom the Duke of Savoy and the King of Denmark appeared in support of the\r\npropositions and demands of Charles V.  The diet did not separate until\r\nit had voted twenty-four thousand foot and four thousand horse to be\r\nemployed against France, and had forbidden Germans, under severe\r\npenalties, to take service with Francis I.  In 1544 the war thus became\r\nalmost European, and in the early days of April two armies were\r\nconcentrated in Piedmont, near the little town of Ceresole, the Spanish\r\ntwenty thousand strong and the French nineteen thousand; the former under\r\nthe orders of the Marquis del Guasto, the latter under those of the Count\r\nd’Enghien; both ready to deliver a battle which was, according to one\r\nside, to preserve Europe from the despotic sway of a single master, and,\r\naccording to the other, to protect Europe against a fresh invasion of\r\nMussulmans.\r\n\r\nFrancis of Bourbon, Count d’Enghien, had received from the king a\r\nprohibition to give battle.  He was believed to be weaker than the\r\nMarquis del Guasto, who showed eagerness to deliver it.  Convinced that\r\nsuch a position was as demoralizing as it was disagreeable for him, the\r\nyoung Count d’Enghien sent a valiant and intelligent gentleman, Blaise de\r\nMontluc, who had already had experience in the great wars of the reign,\r\nto carry his representations to the king.  Francis I. summoned the\r\nmessenger to a meeting of the council, at which the dauphin, Henry, stood\r\nbehind his father’s chair.  “Montluc,” said the king, “I wish you to\r\nreturn and report my deliberation and the opinion of my council to M.\r\nd’Enghien, and to listen here to the difficulty that stands in the way of\r\nour being able to grant him leave to give battle, as he demands.”  The\r\nCount de St. Pol spoke and set forth the reasons the king had for not\r\ndesiring battle; and the end of them all was that there was a chance of\r\nlosing, which would be a matter for regret beyond all comparison with the\r\nadvantage to be gained from winning.  “I stamped with impatience to\r\nspeak,” says Montluc, “and would have broken in; but M. de St. Pol made\r\nme a sign with his hand, saying, ‘Quiet! quiet!’ which made me hold my\r\ntongue, and I saw that the king set on a-laughing.  Then he told me that\r\nhe wished me to say freely what I thought about it.  ‘I consider myself\r\nmost happy, sir,’ said I, ‘for when you were dauphin, and before you were\r\ncalled to this great charge which God hath given you, you tried the\r\nfortune of war as much as any king that ever hath been in France, without\r\nsparing your own person any more than the meanest gentleman.  Well, a\r\nsoldier-king is the only one I can address.’  The dauphin, who was facing\r\nme,” continued Montluc, “made me a sign with his head, which caused me to\r\nthink that he wished me to speak boldly.  Then said I, ‘Sir, I count that\r\nthere will be forty-five hundred or forty-six hundred of us Gascons, all\r\ntold; and all of us, captains and soldiers, will give you our names and\r\nthe places whence we come, and will stake our heads that we will fight on\r\nthe day of battle, if it should please you to grant it.  It is a matter\r\nthat we have been awaiting and desiring this long while, without much\r\ntaking of counsel; be assured, sir, there are not more resolute soldiers\r\nthan yonder.  There are, besides, thirteen companies of Swiss, who will\r\ngive you the same pledge as we who are your subjects; and we will hand in\r\nto you the names of them all for to be sent to their cantons in order\r\nthat, if there be any who shall not do his duty, he may die.  You have\r\nthus nine thousand men and more of whom you may be certain that they will\r\nfight to the last gasp of their lives.  As for the Italians and\r\nProvencals, I will not answer to you for them; but perhaps they will all\r\ndo as well as we, when they see us getting to work;’ and then I raised my\r\narm up, as if to strike, whereat the king smiled. Sir,’ said I, ‘I have\r\nheard from wise captains that it is not the great number that wins, but\r\nthe stout heart; on a day of battle, a moiety doth not fight at all.\r\nWe desire no more; leave it to us.’ The king, who had very favorably\r\nlistened to me, and who took pleasure in seeing my impatience, turned his\r\neyes towards M. de St. Pol, who said, ‘Sir, would you change your opinion\r\nat the words of this madcap, who has no thought for the calamity it would\r\nbe if we were to lose the battle?  It is a matter too important to be\r\nleft for settlement to the brains of a young Gascon.’ I answered him,\r\n‘Sir, let me assure you that I am no braggart, nor so hare-brained as you\r\nconsider me.  All we have to do is not to go and attack the enemy in a\r\nstronghold, as we did at La Bicocca; but M. d’Enghien has too many good\r\nand veteran captains about him to commit such an error.  The only\r\nquestion will be to find means of coming at them in open country, where\r\nthere is neither hedge nor ditch to keep us from setting to work; and\r\nthen, sir, you shall hear talk of the most furious fights that ever were.\r\nI do entreat you most humbly, sir, to admit no thought of anything but a\r\nvictory.’  The dauphin,” continues Montluc, “went on more and more\r\nsmiling, and making signs to me, which gave me still greater boldness in\r\nspeaking.  All the rest spoke and said that the king must not place any\r\nreliance upon my words.  Admiral d’Annebaut said not a syllable, but\r\nsmiled; I suppose he had seen the signs the dauphin was making to me.\r\nM. de St. Pol turns to speak to the king, and says, ‘How, sir!  You seem\r\ndisposed to change your opinion, and listen to the words of this rabid\r\nmadman!’  To whom the king replied, ‘On my honor as a gentleman, cousin,\r\nhe has given me such great and clear reasons, and has represented to me\r\nso well the good courage of my men, that I know not what to do.’  ‘I see\r\nquite well,’ said the Lord of St. Pol, ‘that you have already turned\r\nround.’  Whereupon the king, addressing the admiral, asked him what he\r\nthought about it.  ‘Sir,’ answered the admiral, ‘you have a great mind to\r\ngive them leave to fight.  I will not be surety to you, if they fight,\r\nfor gain or loss, since God alone can know about that; but I will\r\ncertainly pledge you my life and my honor that all they whom he has\r\nmentioned to you will fight, and like good men and true, for I know what\r\nthey are worth from having commanded them.  Only do one thing; we know\r\nwell that you are half brought round and inclined rather to fighting than\r\nthe contrary; make, then, your prayer to God, and entreat Him to be\r\npleased this once to aid you and counsel you as to what you ought to do.’\r\nThen the king lifted his eyes towards heaven, and, clasping his hands and\r\nthrowing his cap upon the table, said, ‘O God, I entreat Thee that it may\r\nplease Thee to this day give me counsel as to what I ought to do for the\r\npreservation of my kingdom, and that all may be to Thy honor and glory!’\r\nWhereupon the admiral asked him, ‘Sir, what opinion occurs to you now?’\r\nThe king, after pausing a little, turned towards me, saying, with a sort\r\nof shout, ‘Let them fight! let them fight!’  ‘Well, then, there is no\r\nmore to be said,’ replied the admiral; ‘if you lose, you alone will be\r\nthe cause of the loss; and, if you win, in like manner; and you, all\r\nalone, will have the satisfaction of it, you alone having given the\r\nleave.’  Then the king and every one rose up, and, as for me, I tingled\r\nwith joy.  His Majesty began talking with the admiral about my despatch\r\nand about giving orders for the pay which was in arrears.  And M. de St.\r\nPol accosted me, saying with a laugh, ‘Rabid madman, thou wilt be cause\r\nof the greatest weal that could happen to the king, or of the greatest\r\nwoe.’”\r\n\r\nMontluc’s boldness and Francis I.’s confidence in yielding to it were not\r\nunrewarded.  The battle was delivered at Ceresole on the 14th of April,\r\n1544; it was bravely disputed and for some time indecisive, even in the\r\nopinion of the anxious Count d’Enghien, who was for a while in an awkward\r\npredicament; but the ardor of the Gascons and the firmness of the Swiss\r\nprevailed, and the French army was victorious.  Montluc was eagerly\r\ndesirous of being commissioned to go and carry to the king the news of\r\nthe victory which he had predicted and to which he had contributed; but\r\nanother messenger had the preference; and he does not, in his Memoires,\r\nconceal his profound discontent; but he was of those whom their\r\ndiscontent does not dishearten, and he continued serving his king and his\r\ncountry with such rigorous and stubborn zeal as was destined hereafter,\r\nin the reign of Henry III., to make him Marshal of France at last.  He\r\nhad to suffer a disappointment more serious than that which was personal\r\nto himself; the victory of Ceresole had not the results that might have\r\nbeen expected.  The war continued; Charles V. transferred his principal\r\nefforts therein to the north, on the frontiers of the Low Countries and\r\nFrance, having concluded an alliance with Henry VIII. for acting in\r\nconcert and on the offensive.  Champagne and Picardy were simultaneously\r\ninvaded by the Germans and the English; Henry VIII. took Boulogne;\r\nCharles V. advanced as far as Chateau-Thierry and threatened Paris.\r\nGreat was the consternation there; Francis I. hurried up from\r\nFontainebleau and rode about the streets, accompanied by the Duke of\r\nGuise, and everywhere saying, “If I cannot keep you from fear, I will\r\nkeep you from harm.”  “My God,” he had exclaimed, as he started from\r\nFontainebleau, “how dear Thou sellest me my kingdom!”  The people\r\nrecovered courage and confidence; they rose in a body; forty thousand\r\narmed militiamen defiled, it is said, before the king.  The army arrived\r\nby forced marches, and took post between Paris and Chateau-Thierry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Claude de Lorraine, Duke of Guise----130]\r\n\r\nCharles V. was not rash; he fell back to Crespy in Laonness, some few\r\nleagues from his Low Countries.  Negotiations were opened; and Francis\r\nI., fearing least Henry VIII., being master of Boulogne, should come and\r\njoin Charles V., ordered his negotiator, Admiral d’Annebaut, to accept\r\nthe emperor’s offers, “for fear lest he should rise higher in his demands\r\nwhen he knew that Boulogne was in the hands of the King of England.”  The\r\ndemands were hard, but a little less so than those made in 1540; Charles\r\nV. yielded on some special points, being possessed beyond everything with\r\nthe desire of securing Francis I.’s co-operation in the two great\r\ncontests he was maintaining, against the Turks in eastern Europe and\r\nagainst the Protestants in Germany.  Francis I. conceded everything in\r\nrespect of the European policy in order to retain his rights over\r\nMilaness and to recover the French towns on the Somme.  Peace was signed\r\nat Crespy on the 18th of September, 1544; and it was considered so bad an\r\none that the dauphin thought himself bound to protest, first of all\r\nsecretly before notaries and afterwards at Fontainebleau, on the 12th of\r\nDecember, in the presence of three princes of the royal house.  This\r\nfeeling was so general that several great bodies, amongst others the\r\nParliament of Toulouse (on the 22d of January, 1545), followed the\r\ndauphin’s example.\r\n\r\nFrancis I. was ill, saddened, discouraged, and still he thought of\r\nnothing but preparing for a fifth great campaign against Charles V.\r\nSince his glorious victory at Melegnano in the beginning of his reign,\r\nfortune had almost invariably forsaken his policy and all his\r\nenterprises, whether of war or of diplomacy; but, falling at one time a\r\nvictim to the defects of his mind and character, and being at another\r\nhurried away by his better qualities and his people’s sympathy, he took\r\nno serious note of the true causes or the inevitable consequences of his\r\nreverses, and realized nothing but their outward and visible signs,\r\nwhilst still persisting in the same hopeful illusions and the same ways\r\nof government.  Happily for the lustre of his reign and the honor of his\r\nname, he had desires and tastes independent of the vain and reckless\r\npolicy practised by him with such alternations of rashness and feebleness\r\nas were more injurious to the success of his designs than to his personal\r\nrenown, which was constantly recovering itself through the brilliancy of\r\nhis courage, the generous though superficial instincts of his soul, and\r\nthe charm of a mind animated by a sincere though ill-regulated sympathy\r\nfor all the beautiful works of mankind in literature, science, and art,\r\nand for all that does honor and gives embellishment to the life of human\r\nbeings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.----FRANCIS I. AND THE RENAISSANCE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANCIS I.----137]\r\n\r\nFrancis I., in his life as a king and a soldier, had two rare pieces of\r\ngood fortune: two great victories, Melegnano and Ceresole, stand out at\r\nthe beginning and the end of his reign; and in his direst defeat, at\r\nPavia, he was personally a hero.  In all else, as regards his government,\r\nhis policy was neither an able nor a successful one; for two and thirty\r\nyears he was engaged in plans, attempts, wars, and negotiations; he\r\nfailed in all his designs; he undertook innumerable campaigns or\r\nexpeditions that came to nothing; he concluded forty treaties of war,\r\npeace, or truce, incessantly changing aim, and cause, and allies; and,\r\nfor all this incoherent activity, he could not manage to conquer either\r\nthe empire or Italy; he brought neither aggrandizement nor peace to\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nOutside of the political arena, in quite a different field of ideas and\r\nfacts, that is, in the intellectual field, Francis I. did better and\r\nsucceeded better.  In this region he exhibited an instinct and a taste\r\nfor the grand and the beautiful; he had a sincere love for literature,\r\nscience, and art; he honored and protected, and effectually too, their\r\nworks and their representatives.  And therein it is that more than one\r\nsovereign and more than one age have found their purest glory to consist.\r\nVirgil, Horace, and Livy contributed quite as much as the foundation of\r\nthe empire to shed lustre on the reign of Augustus.  Bossuet, Pascal, and\r\nFenelon, Corneille, Racine, Boileau, Moliere, and La Fontaine, count for\r\nquite as much as his great warriors and his able administrators in regard\r\nto the splendor of the age of Louis XIV.  People are quite right to set\r\nthis estimate upon the heroes of the human mind and upon their works;\r\ntheir portion in the history of mankind is certainly not the most\r\ndifficult, but it is that which provides both those who give and those\r\nwho take with the purest delights, and which is the least dear in respect\r\nof what it costs the nation.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Francis I. occupies the first half of the century (the\r\nsixteenth), which has been called the age of Renaissance.  Taken\r\nabsolutely, and as implying a renaissance, following upon a decay of\r\nscience, literature, and art, the expression is exaggerated, and goes\r\nbeyond the truth; it is not true that the five centuries which rolled by\r\nbetween the establishment of the Capetians and the accession of Francis\r\nI. (from 987 to 1515), were a period of intellectual barrenness and\r\ndecay; the middle ages, amidst the anarchy, violence, and calamities of\r\ntheir social condition, had, in philosophy, literature, and art, works of\r\ntheir own and a glory of their own, which lacked not originality, or\r\nbrilliancy, or influence over subsequent ages.  There is no idea of\r\ntelling their history here; we only desire to point out, with some sort\r\nof precision, their special character and their intellectual worth.\r\n\r\nAt such a period, what one would scarcely expect to find is intellectual\r\nambition on a very extensive scale and great variety in the branches of\r\nknowledge and in the scope of ideas.  And yet it is in the thirteenth\r\ncentury that we meet for the first time in Europe and in France with the\r\nconception and the execution of a vast repertory of different scientific\r\nand literary works produced by the brain of man, in fact with a veritable\r\nEncyclopaedia.  It was a monk, a preaching friar, a simple Dominican\r\nreader (lector qualiscumque), whose life was passed, as he himself says,\r\nby the side and under the eye of the superior-general of his order, who\r\nundertook and accomplished this great labor.  Vincent of Beauvais, born\r\nat Beauvais between 1184 and 1194, who died at his native place in 1264,\r\nan insatiable glutton for books (librorum helluo), say his\r\ncontemporaries, collected and edited what he called _Bibliotheca Mundi,\r\nSpeculum majus_ (Library of the World, an enlarged Mirror), an immense\r\ncompilation, the first edition of which, published at Strasbourg in 1473,\r\ncomprises ten volumes folio, and would comprise fifty or sixty volumes\r\noctavo.  The work contains three, and, according to some manuscripts,\r\nfour parts, entitled _Speculum naturale_ (Mirror of Natural Science),\r\n_Speculum historiale_ (Mirror of Historical Science), _Speculum\r\ndoctrinale_ (Mirror of Metaphysical Science), and _Speculum morale_\r\n(Mirror of Moral Science).  M. Daunou, in the notice he has given to it\r\n[in the xviiith volume of the _Histoire litteraire de la France,_ begun\r\nby the Benedictines and continued by the _Academie des Inscriptions et\r\nBelleslettres de l’Institut,_ pp. 449-519], disputes, not without reason,\r\nthe authenticity of this last part.  Each of these Specula contains a\r\nsummary, extracted from the various writings which have reference to the\r\nsubject of it, and the authors of which Vincent of Beauvais takes care to\r\nname.  M. Daunou, at the end of his learned notice, has described the\r\nnature, the merit, and the interest of the work in the following terms:\r\n“The writings and documents which we have to thank Vincent of Beauvais\r\nfor having preserved to us are such as pertain to veritable studies, to\r\ndoctrines, to traditions, and even to errors which obtained a certain\r\namount of credit or exercised a certain amount of influence in the course\r\nof ages.  .  .  .  Whenever it is desirable to know what were in France,\r\nabout 1250, the tendency and the subjects of the most elevated studies,\r\nwhat sciences were cultivated, what books, whether ancient, or, for the\r\ntime, modern, were or might have been read, what questions were in\r\nagitation, what doctrines were prevalent in schools, monasteries,\r\nchurches, and the world, it will be to Vincent of Beauvais, above all,\r\nthat recourse must be had.”  There is nothing to be added to this\r\njudicious estimate; there is no intention of entering here into any sort\r\nof detail about the work of Vincent of Beauvais; only it is desirable to\r\nbring some light to bear upon the intellectual aspirations and activity\r\nof the middle ages in France previously to the new impulse which was to\r\nbe communicated to them by the glorious renaissance of Greek and Roman\r\nantiquity.  A scientific, historical, and philosophical encyclopaedia of\r\nthe thirteenth century surely deserves to find a place in the preface to\r\nthe sixteenth.\r\n\r\nAfter the encyclopaedist of the middle ages come, naturally, their\r\nphilosophers.  They were numerous; and some of them have remained\r\nillustrious.  Several of them, at the date of their lives and labors,\r\nhave already been met with and remarked upon in this history, such as\r\nGerbert of Aurillac, who became Pope Sylvester II., St. Anselm, Abelard,\r\nSt. Bernard, Robert of Sorbon, founder of the Sorbonne, and St. Thomas\r\nAquinas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: St. Thomas Aquinas and Abelard----140]\r\n\r\nTo these names, known to every enlightened man, might be added many\r\nothers less familiar to the public, but belonging to men who held a high\r\nplace in the philosophical contests of their times, such as John Scot\r\nErigena, Berenger, Roscelin, William of Champeaux, Gilbert of La Poree,\r\n&c.  The questions which always have taken and always will take a\r\npassionate hold of men’s minds in respect of God, the universe, and man,\r\nin respect of our origin, our nature, and our destiny, were raised and\r\ndiscussed, from the eleventh to the fifteenth century, if not with so\r\nmuch brilliancy, at any rate with as much boldness and earnest thought,\r\nas at any other period.  The middle ages had, in France, their\r\nspiritualists, their materialists, their pantheists, their rationalists,\r\ntheir mystics, and their sceptics, not very clear or refined in their\r\nnotions, but such as lacked neither profundity in their general view of\r\nthe questions, nor ingenious subtilty in their argumentative process.  We\r\ndo not care to give in this place any exposition or estimate of their\r\ndoctrines; we shall simply point out what there was original and\r\ncharacteristic in their fashion of philosophizing, and wherein their\r\nmental condition differed essentially from that which was engendered and\r\npropagated, in the sixteenth century, by the resuscitation of Greek and\r\nRoman antiquity.\r\n\r\nIt is the constant idea of the philosophers and theologians of that\r\nperiod to affirm and to demonstrate the agreement between Christian faith\r\nand reason.  They consider themselves placed between two fixed points,\r\nfaith in the Christian truths inculcated from the very first or formally\r\nrevealed by God to man, and reason, which is the faculty given to man to\r\nenable him to recognize the truth.  “Faith,” wrote Hildebert, Archbishop\r\nof Tours, in the eleventh century, “is not contrary to reason, but it is\r\nabove reason.  If, like the philosophers, one willeth not to believe\r\nanything but what reason comprehends, faith, in this case, hath no merit.\r\nThe merit is in believing that which, without being contrary to reason,\r\nis above it.  .  .  .  Faith is certainty in respect of things which fall\r\nnot under the perceptions of the body; it is below knowledge, for to\r\nbelieve is less than to know; and it is above opinion, for to believe is\r\nmore than to imagine.”  “I do not seek to understand in order to\r\nbelieve,” says St. Anselm; “I believe in order to understand.  .  .  .\r\nAuthority requires faith in order to prepare man for reason.”  But\r\n“authority,” said St. Columban, in the sixth century, “proceeds from\r\nright reason, not at all reason from authority.  Every authority whereof\r\nthe decrees are not approved of by right reason appears mighty weak.”\r\n Minds so liberal in the face of authority, and at the same time attached\r\nto revealed and traditional faith, could not but be sometimes painfully\r\nperplexed.  “My wounded spirit,” said Adam of the Premontre-order (le\r\npremontre), in the twelfth century, “calls to her aid that which is the\r\nsource of all grace and all life.  But where is it?  What is it?  In her\r\ntrouble the spirit hath love abiding; but she knows no longer what it is\r\nshe loves, what she ought to love.  She addresseth herself to the stones\r\nand to the rocks, and saith to them, ‘What are ye?’  And the stones and\r\nthe rocks make answer, ‘We are creatures of the same even as thou art.’\r\nTo the like question the sun, the moon, and the stars make the like\r\nanswer.  The spirit doth interrogate the sand of the sea, the dust of the\r\nearth, the drops of rain, the days of the years, the hours of the days,\r\nthe moments of the hours, the turf of the fields, the branches of the\r\ntrees, the leaves of the branches, the scales of fish, the wings of\r\nbirds, the utterances of men, the voices of animals, the movements of\r\nbodies, the thoughts of minds; and these things declare, all with one\r\nconsent, unto the spirit, ‘We are not that which thou demandest; search\r\nup above us, and thou wilt find our Creator!’”  In the tenth century,\r\nRemigius the theologian had gone still farther: “I have resolved,” said\r\nhe, “to make an investigation as to my God; for it doth not suffice me to\r\nbelieve in Him; I wish further to see somewhat of Him.  I feel that there\r\nis somewhat beyond my spirit.  If my spirit should abide within herself\r\nwithout rising above herself, she would see only herself; it must be\r\nabove herself that my spirit will reach God.”\r\n\r\nGod, creator, lawgiver, and preserver of the universe and of man,\r\neverywhere and always present and potent, in permanent connection, nay,\r\ncommunication, with man, at one time by natural and at another by\r\nsupernatural means, at one time by the channel of authority and at\r\nanother by that of free-agency, this is the point of departure, this the\r\nfixed idea of the philosopho-theologians of the middle ages.  There are\r\ngreat gaps, great diversities, and great inconsistencies in their\r\ndoctrines; they frequently made unfair use of the subtile dialectics\r\ncalled scholastics (la scolastique), and they frequently assigned too\r\nmuch to the master’s authority (l’autorite du maitre); but Christian\r\nfaith, more or less properly understood and explained, and adhesion to\r\nthe facts, to the religious and moral precepts, and to the primitive and\r\nessential testimonies of Christianity, are always to be found at the\r\nbottom of their systems and their disputes.  Whether they be pantheists\r\neven or sceptics, it is in an atmosphere of Christianity that they live\r\nand that their thoughts are developed.\r\n\r\nA breath from the grand old pagan life of Greece and Rome heaved forth\r\nagain and spread, in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, throughout\r\nthis Christian atmosphere of the middle ages.  Greek and Roman antiquity,\r\nwith its ideas and its works, had never been completely forgotten\r\ntherein.  Aristotle and Plato, Seneca, Epictetus, Boetius, and other\r\nancients had taken their place amongst the studies and philosophical\r\nnotions of that period; but their influence had been limited to\r\nprofessional scholars, and had remained without any social influence.\r\nIn spite of the stateliness of its ceremonies and the charm of its\r\ntraditions, paganism had never been, in plain truth, a religion; faith\r\nand piety had held but a paltry place in it; instead of a God, the\r\ncreator and acting sovereign of the world, its gods were of human\r\ninvention and human nature: their adventures and the parts they played\r\nwere pleasing to the imagination, but gave no sort of satisfaction to the\r\ndeep instincts and higher aspirations of the soul.  Christianity is God\r\nhovering over, watching over, and descending to earth; paganism is earth,\r\nits children and the stories of their lives transported, with their vices\r\nrather than their virtues, to heaven.  Olympus was peopled with nothing\r\nbut personages belonging to popular tradition, mythology, or allegory;\r\nand in the fifteenth century this mythology was in full course of decay;\r\nall that it might have commanded of credence or influence had vanished;\r\nthere remained of it nothing but barren memories or a contemptuous\r\nincredulity.  Speaking from the religious point of view, the Renaissance\r\nwas but a resurrection of paganism dying out before the presence of the\r\nChristian world, which was troubled and perplexed, but full of life and\r\nfuturity.\r\n\r\nThe religious question thus set on one side, the Renaissance was a great\r\nand happy thing, which restored to light and honor the works and glories\r\nof the Greek and Roman communities, those two communities which, in\r\nhistory anterior to the sixteenth century, had reached the greatest\r\nprosperity and splendor under a civil regimen, in the midst of a more or\r\nless stormy but real and strong political freedom, and had attained by\r\nthe mere development of human thought and human energy the highest degree\r\nof civilization yet known in Europe, and, one would be inclined to say,\r\nin the world.  The memorials and monuments of this civilization, which\r\nwere suddenly removed, at the fall of the Greek empire, to Italy first\r\nand then from Italy to France, and throughout the whole of Western\r\nEurope, impressed with just admiration people as well as princes, and\r\ninspired them with the desire of marching forward in their turn in this\r\nattractive and glorious career.  This kind of progress, arrived at by the\r\nroad of imitation, often costs dear in the interruption it causes to the\r\nnatural course of the peculiar and original genius of nations; but this\r\nis the price at which the destinies of diverse communities get linked\r\ntogether and interpenetrate, and the general progress of humanity is\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nIt was not only in religious questions and by their philosopho-\r\ntheologians that the middle ages, before the Renaissance, displayed their\r\nactivity and fecundity.  In literature and in art, in history and in\r\npoesy, in architecture and in sculpture, they had produced great and\r\nbeautiful works, which were quite worthy of surviving, and have, in fact,\r\nsurvived the period of their creation.  Here, too, the Renaissance of\r\nGreek and Roman antiquity came in, and altered the originality of the\r\nearliest productions of the middle ages, and gave to literature and to\r\nart in France a new direction.  It will be made a point here to note with\r\nsome exactness the peculiar and native character of French literature at\r\nits origin.  It is a far cry from the middle ages to the time of Louis\r\nXIV.; but the splendors of the most lovely days do not efface the charm\r\nbelonging to the glimmerings of dawn.\r\n\r\nThe first amongst the literary creations of the middle ages is that of\r\nthe French language itself.  When we pass from the ninth to the\r\nthirteenth century, from the oath of Charles the Bald and Louis the\r\nGermanic at Strasbourg, in 842, to the account of the conquest of\r\nConstantinople in 1203, given by Geoffrey de Villehardouin, seneschal of\r\nChampagne, what a space has been traversed, what progress accomplished in\r\nthe language of France!  It was, at first, nothing but a coarse and\r\nirregular mixture of German and Latin, the former still in a barbarous\r\nand the latter already in a corrupted state; and amidst this mixture\r\nappear some fragments of the Celtic idioms of Gaul, without any literary\r\ntradition to regulate this mass of incoherence and confusion.  As for\r\nfollowing the development, regulation, and transformation of the French\r\nnational language during these three centuries, and marking how it issued\r\nfrom this formless and vulgar chaos, there are not facts and documents\r\nenough for our guidance throughout that long travail; but when the\r\nthirteenth century begins, when Villehardouin tells the tale of the\r\ncrusade, which put, for seventy years, Constantinople and the Greek\r\nempire of the East in the hands of the Latin and German warriors of the\r\nWest, the French language, though still rude and somewhat fluctuating,\r\nappears already rich, varied, and capable of depicting with fidelity and\r\nenergy events, ideas, characters, and the passions of men.  There we have\r\nFrench prose and French poesy in their simple and lusty youth; the\r\n_Conquest of Constantinople_ by Geoffrey de Villehardouin, and the _Song\r\nof Roland_ by the unknown poet who collected and put together in the form\r\nof an epopee the most heroic amongst the legends of the reign of\r\nCharlemagne, are the first great and beautiful monuments of French\r\nliterature in the middle ages.\r\n\r\nThe words are French literature; and of that alone is there any intention\r\nof speaking here.  The middle ages had, up to the sixteenth century, a\r\nLatin literature; philosophers, theologians, and chroniclers all wrote in\r\nLatin.  The philosophers and theologians have already been spoken of.\r\nAmongst the chroniclers some deserve the name of historians; not only do\r\nthey alone make us acquainted with the history of their times, but they\r\nsometimes narrate it with real talent as observers and writers.  Gregory\r\nof Tours, Eginhard, William of Tyre, Guibert of Nogent, William of\r\nJumieges, and Orderic Vital are worthy of every attention from those\r\nwhose hearts are set upon thoroughly understanding the history of the\r\nperiods and the provinces of which those laborers of the middle ages\r\nhave, in Latin, preserved the memorials.  The chief of those works have\r\nbeen gathered together and translated in a special collection bearing the\r\nname of Guizot.  But it is with the reign of Francis I. that, to bid a\r\ntruce to further interruption, we commence the era of the real grand\r\nliterature of France, that which has constituted and still constitutes\r\nthe pride and the noble pleasure of the French public.  Of that alone we\r\nwould here denote the master-works and the glorious names, putting them\r\ncarefully at the proper dates and places in the general course of events;\r\na condition necessary for making them properly understood and their\r\ninfluence properly appreciated.  As to the reign of Francis I., however,\r\nit must be premised as follows: several of the most illustrious of French\r\nwriters, in poesy and prose, Ronsard, Montaigne, Bodin, and Stephen\r\nPasquier, were born during that king’s lifetime and during the first half\r\nof the sixteenth century; but it is to the second half of that century\r\nand to the first of the seventeenth that they belong by the glory of\r\ntheir works and of their influence; their place in history will be\r\nassigned to them when we enter upon the precise epoch at which they\r\nperformed and shone.  We will at present confine ourselves to the great\r\nsurvivors of the middle ages, whether in prose or poesy, and to the men\r\nwho shed lustre on the reign of Francis I. himself, and led French\r\nliterature in its first steps along the road on which it entered at that\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe middle ages bequeathed to French literature four prose-writers whom\r\nwe cannot hesitate to call great historians: Villehardouin, Joinville,\r\nFroissart, and Commynes.  Geoffrey de Villehardouin, after having taken\r\npart, as negotiator and soldier, in the crusade which terminated in the\r\ncapture of Constantinople, and having settled in Thessaly, at\r\nMessinopolis, as holder of considerable fiefs, with the title of Marshal\r\nof Romania (Roumelia), employed his leisure in writing a history of this\r\ngreat exploit.  He wrote with a dignified simplicity, epic and at the\r\nsame time practical, speaking but little of himself, narrating facts with\r\nthe precision of one who took part in them, and yet without useless\r\ndetail or personal vanity, finding pleasure in doing justice to his\r\ncomrades, amongst others the veteran Doge of Venice, Henry Dandolo, and\r\nsometimes intermingling with his story the reflections of a judicious and\r\nsincere Christian, without any pious fanaticism and without ostentation.\r\nJoinville wrote his History of St. Louis at the request of Joan of\r\nNavarre, wife of Philip the Handsome, and five years after that queen’s\r\ndeath; his manuscripts have it thus: “The things which I personally saw\r\nand heard were written in the year of grace 1309, in the month of\r\nOctober.”  He was then eighty-five, and he dedicated his book to Louis le\r\nHutin (the quarreller), great-grandson of St. Louis.  More lively and\r\nmore familiar in style than Villehardouin, he combines the vivid and\r\nnatural impressions of youth with an old man’s fond clinging to the\r\nmemories of his long life; he likes to bring himself upon the scene,\r\nespecially as regards his relations towards and his conversations with\r\nSt. Louis, for whom he has a tender regard and admiration, at the same\r\ntime that he maintains towards him a considerable independence of ideas,\r\nconduct, and language; he is a valiant and faithful knight, who forms a\r\nvery sensible opinion as to the crusade in which he takes part, and who\r\nwill not enter upon it a second time even to follow the king to whom he\r\nis devoted, but whose pious fanaticism and warlike illusions he does not\r\nshare; his narrative is at one and the same time very full of himself\r\nwithout any pretension, and very spirited without any show of passion,\r\nand fraught with a graceful and easy carelessness which charms the reader\r\nand all the while inspires confidence in the author’s veracity.\r\nFroissart is an insatiable Fry, who revels in all the sights of his day,\r\nevents and personages, wars and galas, adventures of heroism or\r\ngallantry, and who is incessantly gadding about through all the dominions\r\nand all the courts of Europe, everywhere seeking his own special\r\namusement in the satisfaction of his curiosity.  He has himself given an\r\naccount of the manner in which he collected and wrote his Chronicles.\r\n“Ponder,” says he, “amongst yourselves, such of ye as read me, or will\r\nread me, or have read me, or shall hear me read, how I managed to get and\r\nput together so many facts whereof I treat in so many parts.  And, for to\r\ninform you of the truth, I began young, at the age of twenty years, and I\r\ncame into the world amidst the deeds and adventures, and I did always\r\ntake great delight in them, more than in aught else.  And God gave me\r\nsuch grace that I was well with all parties, and with the households of\r\nthe kings, and, especially, the household of King Edward of England, and\r\nthe noble queen his wife, Madame Philippa of Hainault, unto whom, in my\r\nyouth, I was clerk, and I did minister unto her with beautiful ditties\r\nand amorous treatises.  And for love of the service of the noble and\r\nvaliant dame with whom I was, all the other lords, kings, dukes, counts,\r\nbarons, and knights, of whatsoever nation they might be, did love me and\r\nhear me and see me gladly, and brought me great profit.  .  .  .  Thus,\r\nwherever I went, I made inquiry of the old knights and squires who had\r\nbeen at deeds of arms, and who were specially fit to speak thereof, and\r\nalso of certain heralds in good credit for to verify and justify all\r\nmatters.  Thus have I gotten together this lofty and noble history.”\r\n This picture of Froissart and his work by his own hand would be\r\nincomplete without the addition of a characteristic anecdote.  In one of\r\nhis excursions in search of adventures and stories, “he fell in at\r\nPamiers with a good knight, Messire Espaing of Lyons, who had been in all\r\nthe wars of the time, and managed the great affairs of princes.  They set\r\nout to travel together, Messire Espaing telling his comrade what he knew\r\nabout the history of the places whereby they passed, and Froissart taking\r\ngreat care to ride close to him for to hear his words.  Every evening\r\nthey halted at hostels where they drained flagons full of white wine as\r\ngood as the good canon had ever drunk in his life; then, after drinking,\r\nso soon as the knight was weary of relating, the chronicler wrote down\r\njust the substance of his stories, so as to better leave remembrance of\r\nthem for time to come, as there is no way of retaining so certain as\r\nwriting down.”\r\n\r\nThere is no occasion to add to these quotations; they give the most\r\ncorrect idea that can be formed of Froissart’s chronicles and their\r\nliterary merit as well as their historical value.\r\n\r\nPhilip de Commynes is quite another affair, and far more than Froissart,\r\nnay, than Joinville and Villehardouin.  He is a politician proficient in\r\nthe understanding and handling of the great concerns and great personages\r\nof his time.  He served Charles the Rash and Louis XI.; and, after so\r\ntrying an experience, he depicted them and passed judgment upon them with\r\nimperturbable clearsightedness and freedom of thought.  With the recital\r\nof events, as well as the portrayal of character, he mingles here and\r\nthere the reflections, expressed in precise, firm, and temperate\r\nlanguage, of a profound moralist, who sets before himself no other aim\r\nbut that of giving his thoughts full utterance.  He has already been\r\nspoken of in the second volume of this History, in connection with his\r\nleaving the Duke of Burgundy’s service for that of Louis XI., and with\r\nhis remarks upon the virtues as well as the vices of that able but\r\nunprincipled despot.  We will not go again over that ground.  As a king’s\r\nadviser, Commynes would have been as much in place at the side of Louis\r\nXIV. as at that of Louis XI.; as a writer, he, in the fifteenth century,\r\noften made history and politics speak a language which the seventeenth\r\ncentury would not have disowned.\r\n\r\nLet us pass from the prose-writers of the middle ages to their poets.\r\n\r\nThe grand name of poesy is here given only to poetical works which have\r\nlived beyond their cradles and have taken rank amongst the treasures of\r\nthe national literature.  Thanks to sociability of manners, vivacity of\r\nintellect, and fickleness of taste, light and ephemeral poesy has\r\nobtained more success and occupied more space in France than in any other\r\ncountry; but there are successes which give no title to enter into a\r\npeople’s history; quality and endurance of renown are even more requisite\r\nin literature than in politics; and many a man whose verses have been\r\nvery much relished and cried up in his lifetime has neither deserved nor\r\nkept in his native land the beautiful name of poet.  Setting aside, of\r\ncourse, the language and poems of the troubadours of Southern France, we\r\nshall find, in French poesy previous to the Renaissance, only three works\r\nwhich, through their popularity in their own time, still live in the\r\nmemory of the erudite, and one only which, by its grand character and its\r\nsuperior beauties, attests the poetical genius of the middle ages and can\r\nclaim national rights in the history of France.  _The Romance of the\r\nRose_ in the erotic and allegorical style, the _Romances of Renart_ in\r\nthe satirical, and the _Farce of Patelin,_ a happy attempt in the line of\r\ncomedy, though but little known nowadays to the public, are still and\r\nwill remain subjects of literary study.  _The Song of Roland_ alone is an\r\nadmirable sample of epic poesy in France, and the only monument of\r\npoetical genius in the middle ages which can have a claim to national\r\nappreciation in the nineteenth century.  It is almost a pity not to\r\nreproduce here the whole of that glorious epopee, as impressive from the\r\nforcible and pathetic simplicity of its sentiments and language as from\r\nthe grandeur of the scene and the pious heroism of the actors in it.  It\r\nis impossible, however, to resist the pleasure of quoting some fragments\r\nof it.  The best version to refer to is that which has been given almost\r\nword for word, from the original text, by M. Leon Gaultier, in his\r\nbeautiful work, so justly crowned by the _Academie des Inscriptions et\r\nBelles-lettres, on Lee Epopees Francaises_.\r\n\r\nIn 778 Charlemagne was returning from a great expedition in Spain, during\r\nwhich, after having taken Pampeluna, he had failed before Saragossa, and\r\nhad not considered himself called upon to prolong his struggle with the\r\nArab Mussulmans.  He with the main body of his army had crossed the\r\nPyrenees, leaving as rearguard a small division under his nephew Roland,\r\nprefect of the Marches of Brittany, Anselm, count of the palace, Oliver,\r\nRoland’s comrade, Archbishop Turpin, and several other warriors of\r\nrenown.  When they arrived at the little valley of Roncesvalles, between\r\nthe defiles of Sizer and Val Carlos, this rearguard was unexpectedly\r\nattacked by thousands of Basque mountaineers, who were joined by\r\nthousands of Arabs eager to massacre and plunder the Christians and\r\nFranks, who, indeed, perished to a man in this ambuscade.  “The news of\r\nthis disaster,” says Eginhard, in his Annales, “obscured the glory of the\r\nsuccesses the king had but lately obtained in Spain.”  This fact, with\r\nlarge amplifications, became the source of popular legends and songs,\r\nwhich, probably towards the end of the eleventh century, became embodied\r\nin the _Song of Roland,_ attributed, in two manuscripts, but without any\r\ncertainty, to a certain Thuroulde (Turold), Abbot of Malmesbury and\r\nPeterborough under William the Conqueror.  It must suffice to reproduce\r\nhere only the most beautiful and most characteristic passages of this\r\nlittle national epopee, a truly Homeric picture of the quasi-barbarous\r\ntimes and manners of knightly Christendom.\r\n\r\nThe eighty-second strophe of the poem commences thus:\r\n\r\n“‘Of Paynim yonder, saw I more,’\r\nQuoth Oliver, ‘than e’er before\r\nThe eye of man hath seen\r\nAn hundred thousand are a-field,\r\nWith helm and hauberk, lance and shield,\r\nAnd pikes and pike-heads gleaming bright;\r\nPrepare for fight, a fiercer fight\r\nThan ever yet hath been.\r\nBlow Olifant, friend Roland, blow,\r\nThat Charles and all his host may know.’\r\n\r\n“To whom Sir Roland in reply:\r\n‘A madman, then, good faith, were I\r\nFor I should lose all countenance\r\nThroughout the pleasant land of France\r\nNay, rather, facing great and small,\r\nI’ll smite amain with Durandal,\r\nUntil the blade, with blood that’s spilt,\r\nIs crimson to the golden hilt.’\r\n‘Friend Roland, sound a single blast\r\nEre Charles beyond its reach hath passed.’\r\n‘Forbid it, God,’ cried Roland, then,\r\n‘It should be said by living men\r\nThat I a single blast did blow\r\nFor succor from a Paynim foe!’\r\nWhen Roland sees what moil will be,\r\nLion nor pard so fierce as he.\r\n\r\n“Archbishop Turpin looks around,\r\nThen forward pricks to higher ground\r\nHe halts, he speaks; the French give ear:\r\n‘Lords barons, Charles hath left us here,\r\nAnd for our king we’re bound to die;\r\nFor him maintain the Christian cause;\r\nBehold! how near the battle draws;\r\nBehold! where yonder Paynim lie;\r\nConfess to God; and I will give\r\nAbsolvement, that your souls may live.\r\nPure martyrs are ye if ye fall;\r\nAnd Paradise awaits ye all.’\r\n\r\n“Down leap the French, on bended knee\r\nThey fall for benison; and he\r\nDoth lay on all a penance light--\r\nTo strike their hardest in the fight.\r\n\r\n“The French have risen to their feet;\r\nThey leap upon their chargers fleet;\r\nInto the defiles rides their chief\r\nOn his good war-horse, Veillantif.\r\nO, in his harness he looks grand!\r\nOn, on he goes with lance on high\r\nIts tip is pointed to the sky;\r\nIt bears a snow-white pennon, and\r\nIts golden fringes sweep his hand.\r\nHe scans the foe with haughty glance,\r\nWith meek and sweet the men of France\r\n‘Lords barons, gently, gently ride;\r\nYon Paynim rush to suicide;\r\nNo king of France could ever boast\r\nThe wealth we’ll strip from yonder host.’\r\nAnd as the words die off his lips,\r\nChristian and Paynim are at grips.\r\n\r\n“A wondrous fight! The men of France\r\nThrust fiercely with the burnished lance!\r\nO, ‘twas a sight of grief and dread,\r\nSo many wounded, bleeding, dead!\r\nOn back or face together they,\r\nOne on another falling, lay!\r\nThe Paynim cannot choose but yield,\r\nAnd, willy-nilly, quit the field\r\nThe eager French are on their track,\r\nWith lances pointed at the back. . . .\r\n\r\n“Then pricketh forth a Saracen,\r\nAbyme by name, but worst of men\r\nNo faith hath he in God the One,\r\nNo faith in Holy Mary’s Son;\r\nAs black as melted pitch is he,\r\nAnd not for all Galicia’s gold\r\nCould he be bribed his hand to hold\r\nFrom murder and from treachery;\r\nNo merry laugh, no sportive mien\r\nIn him was ever heard or seen. . . .\r\nThe good archbishop could not brook\r\nOn pagan such as he to look;\r\nHe saw and fain would strike him dead,\r\nAnd calmly to himself he said,\r\n‘Yon pagan, as it seems to me,\r\nA grievous heretic must be;\r\n‘There best to slay him, though I died;\r\nCowards I never could abide.’\r\n\r\n“He mounts his steed, won, so they tell,\r\nFrom Denmark’s monarch, hight Grosselle;\r\nHe slew the king and took the steed\r\nThe beast is light and built for speed;\r\nHis hoofs are neat, his legs are clean,\r\nHis thigh is short, his flanks are lean,\r\nHis rump is large, his back full height,\r\nHis mane is yellow, his tail is white;\r\nWith little ears and tawny head,\r\nNo steed like him was ever bred.\r\nThe good archbishop spurs a-field,\r\nAnd smites Abyme upon the shield,\r\nHis emir’s shield, so thickly sown\r\nWith many a gem and precious stone,\r\nAmethyst and topaz, crystals bright,\r\nAnd red carbuncles flashing light:\r\nThe shield is shivered by the blow;\r\nNo longer worth a doit, I trow;\r\nStark dead the emir lies below.\r\n‘Ha! bravely struck!’ the Frenchmen yell:\r\n‘Our bishop guards the Cross right well!’\r\n\r\n“To Oliver Sir Roland cried,\r\n‘Sir comrade, can it be denied\r\nOur bishop is a gallant knight?\r\nNone better ever saw the light!\r\nHow he doth strike\r\nWith lance and pike!’\r\nQuoth Oliver, ‘Then in the fight\r\nHaste we to aid him with our might!’\r\nAnd so the battle is renewed:\r\nThe blows are hard, the melley rude;\r\nThe Christians suffer sore\r\nFour times they charge and all is well,\r\nBut at the fifth--dread tale to tell--\r\nThe knights of France are doomed to fall,--\r\nAll, all her knights; for of them all\r\nGod spareth but threescore.\r\nBut O, their lives they dearly sell!\r\nSir Roland marks what loss is there,\r\nAnd turns him to Sir Oliver\r\n‘Dear comrade, whom pray God to bless,\r\nIn God’s own name see what distress--\r\nSuch heaps of vassals lying low--\r\nFair France hath suffered at a blow\r\nWell may we weep for her, who’s left\r\nA widow, of such lords bereft!\r\nAnd why, O, why art thou not near,\r\nOur king, our friend, to aid us here?\r\nSay, Oliver, how might we bring\r\nOur mournful tidings to the king?’\r\nQuoth Oliver, ‘I know not, I\r\nTo fly were shame; far better die.’\r\nQuoth Roland, ‘I my horn will blow,\r\nThat Charles may hear and Charles may know;\r\nAnd, in the defiles, from their track\r\nThe French, I swear, will hasten back.’\r\nQuoth Oliver, ‘‘Twere grievous shame;\r\n‘Twould bring a blush to all thy name\r\nWhen I said thus thou scornedst me,\r\nAnd now I will not counsel thee.\r\nAnd shouldst thou blow, ‘twere no great blast;\r\nAlready blood is gushing fast\r\nFrom both thine arms.’ ‘That well may be,’\r\nQuoth he, ‘I struck so lustily!\r\nThe battle is too strong: I’ll blow\r\nMine Olifant, that Charles may know.’\r\nQuoth Oliver, ‘Had Charles been here,\r\nThis battle had not cost so dear;\r\nBut as for yon poor souls, I wis,\r\nNo blame can rest with them for this.’\r\n‘Why bear me spite?’ Sir Roland said.\r\n‘The fault,’ said he, ‘lies on thy head.\r\nAnd mark my words; this day will see\r\nThe end of our good company;\r\nWe twain shall part--not as we met--\r\nFull sadly ere yon sun bath set.’\r\nThe good archbishop hears the stir,\r\nAnd thither pricks with golden spur;\r\nAnd thus he chides the wrangling lords\r\n‘Roland, and you, Sir Oliver,\r\nWhy strive ye with such bitter words\r\nHorns cannot save you; that is past;\r\nBut still ‘twere best to sound a blast;\r\nLet the king come: he’ll strike a blow\r\nFor vengeance, lest the Paynim foe\r\nBack to their homes in triumph go.’\r\n\r\n“With pain and dolor, groan and pant,\r\nCount Roland sounds his Olifant:\r\nThe crimson stream shoots from his lips;\r\nThe blood from bursten temple drips;\r\nBut far, O, far the echoes ring,\r\nAnd, in the defiles, reach the king;\r\nReach Naymes, and the French array:\r\n‘Tis Roland’s horn,’ the king doth say;\r\n‘He only sounds when brought to bay.’\r\nHow huge the rocks! How dark and steep!\r\nThe streams are swift! The valleys deep!\r\nOut blare the trumpets, one and all,\r\nAs Charles responds to Roland’s call.\r\nRound wheels the king, with choler mad,\r\nThe Frenchmen follow grim and sad;\r\nNot one but prays for Roland’s life,\r\nTill they have joined him in the strife.\r\nBut ah! what prayer can alter fate?\r\nThe time is past; too late! too late!\r\nAs Roland scans both plain and height,\r\nAnd sees how many Frenchmen lie\r\nStretched in their mortal agony,\r\nHe mourns them like a noble knight:\r\n‘Comrades, God give ye grace to-day,\r\nAnd grant ye Paradise, I pray!\r\nNo lieges ever fought as they.\r\nWhat a fair land, O France, art thou!\r\nBut ah! forlorn and widowed now!\r\nO Oliver, at least to thee,\r\nMy brother, I must faithful be\r\nBack, comrade mine, back let us go,\r\nAnd charge once more the Paynim foe!’\r\n\r\n“When Roland spies the cursed race,\r\nMore black than ink, without a trace,\r\nSave teeth, of whiteness in the face,\r\n‘Full certified,’ quoth he, ‘am I,\r\nThat we this very day shall die.\r\nStrike, Frenchmen, strike; that’s all my mind!’\r\n‘A curse on him who lags behind!’\r\nQuoth gallant Oliver; and so\r\nDown dash the Frenchmen on the foe. . . .\r\nSir Oliver with failing breath,\r\nKnowing his wound is to the death,\r\nDoth call to him his friend, his peer,\r\nHis Roland: ‘Comrade, come thou here;\r\nTo be apart what pain it were!’\r\nWhen Roland marks his friend’s distress,\r\nHis face all pale and colorless,\r\n‘My God!’ quoth he, ‘what’s now to do?\r\nO my sweet France, what dole for you,\r\nWidowed of all your warriors true!\r\nYou needs must perish!’ At such plaint,\r\nUpon his steed he falls a-faint.\r\n\r\n“See Roland riding in a swound:\r\nAnd Oliver with mortal wound;\r\nWith loss of blood so dazed is he\r\nHe neither near nor far can see\r\nWhat manner of man a man may be:\r\nAnd, meeting with Sir Roland so,\r\nHe dealeth him a fearful blow\r\nThat splits the gilded helm in two\r\nDown to the very nasal, though,\r\nBy luck, the skull it cleaves not through.\r\nWith blank amaze doth Roland gaze,\r\nAnd gently, very gently, says,\r\n‘Dear comrade, smit’st thou with intent?\r\nMethinks no challenge hath been sent\r\nI’m Roland, who doth love thee so.’\r\nQuoth Oliver, ‘Thy voice I know,\r\nBut see thee not; God save thee, friend:\r\nI struck thee; prithee pardon me.\r\nNo hurt have I; and there’s an end.’\r\nQuoth Roland, ‘And I pardon thee\r\n‘Fore man and God right willingly.’\r\nThey bow the head, each to his brother,\r\nAnd so, in love, leave one another.”\r\n\r\n(Oliver dies: Roland and Archbishop Turpin continue the fight.)\r\n\r\n“Then Roland takes his horn once more;\r\nHis blast is feebler than before,\r\nBut still it reaches the emperor\r\nHe hears it, and he halts to shout,\r\n‘Let clarions, one and all, ring out!’\r\nThen sixty thousand clarions ring,\r\nAnd rocks and dales set echoing.\r\nAnd they, too, hear--the pagan pack;\r\nThey force the rising laughter back;\r\n‘Charles, Charles,’ they cry, ‘is on our track!’\r\nThey fly; and Roland stands alone--\r\nAlone, afoot; his steed is gone--\r\nBrave Veillantif is gone, and so,\r\nHe, willy-nilly, afoot must go.\r\nArchbishop Turpin needs his aid:\r\nThe golden helm is soon unlaced,\r\nThe light, white hauberk soon unbraced;\r\nAnd gently, gently down he laid\r\nOn the green turf the bishop’s head;\r\nAnd then beseechingly he said,--\r\n“‘Ah! noble sir, your leave I crave\r\nThe men we love, our comrades brave,\r\nAll, all are dead; they must not lie\r\nHere thus neglected; wherefore I\r\nWill seek for them, each where he lies,\r\nAnd lay them out before your eyes.’\r\n‘Go,’ said the bishop, ‘and speed be thine\r\nThank God! the field is thine and mine.’\r\n\r\n“Sir Roland searched the plain, and found\r\nHis comrade’s body on the ground;\r\nUnto his heart he strained it tight,\r\nAnd bore it off, as best he might.\r\nUpon a shield he lays his friend\r\nBeside the rest, and, for an end,\r\nThe bishop gives them, all and one,\r\nAbsolvement and a benison.\r\nAs Roland marks them lying there,\r\nHis peers all dead--and Oliver,\r\nHis mighty grief he cannot stay,\r\nAnd, willy-nilly, swoons away.\r\n\r\n“The bishop feeleth grief profound\r\nTo see Sir Roland in a swound.\r\nThrough Roncesvalles, well he knows,\r\nA stream of running water flows,\r\nAnd fain would he a journey make\r\nTo fetch thereof for Roland’s sake,\r\nHe totters forth; he makes essay;\r\nBut all! his feeble limbs give way;\r\nBreaks his great heart; he falls and lies,\r\nFace downward, in death’s agonies!\r\nSo Charles’s soldier-priest is dead\r\nHe who with mighty lance and sword\r\nAnd preacher’s craft incessant warred\r\nAgainst the scorners of the Lord:\r\nGod’s benediction on his head!\r\nCount Roland laid him to his rest\r\nBetween his shoulders, on his breast,\r\nHe crossed the hands so fine and fair,\r\nAnd, as his country’s customs were,\r\nHe made oration o’er him there\r\n‘Ah! noble knight, of noble race,\r\nI do commend thee to God’s grace\r\nSure never man of mortal birth\r\nServed Him so heartily on earth.\r\nThou hadst no peer in any clime\r\nTo stoutly guard the Christian cause\r\nAnd turn bad men to Christian laws,\r\nSince erst the great Apostles’ time.\r\nNow rest thy soul from dolor free,\r\nAnd Paradise be oped to thee!’”\r\n\r\n(A last encounter takes place: a Saracen left wounded on the\r\nbattle-field, seeing Roland in a swoon, gets up, and approaches him,\r\nsaying, “Vanquished,  he is vanquished, the nephew of Charles! There is\r\nhis sword, which I will carry off to Arabia!”)\r\n\r\n“And as he makes to draw the steel,\r\nA something doth Sir Roland feel;\r\nHe opes his eyes, says nought but this,\r\n‘Thou art not one of us, I wis,’\r\nRaises the horn he would not quit,\r\nAnd cracks the pagan’s skull with it. . .\r\nAnd then the touch of death that steals\r\nDown, down from head to heart he feels\r\nUnder yon pine he hastes away\r\nOn the green turf his head to lay\r\nPlacing beneath him horn and sword,\r\nHe turns towards the Paynim horde,\r\nAnd, there, beneath the pine, he sees\r\nA vision of old memories\r\nA thought of realms he helped to win,\r\nOf his sweet France, of kith and kin,\r\nAnd Charles, his lord, who nurtured him.\r\nHe sighs, and tears his eyes bedim.\r\nThen, not unmindful of his case,\r\nOnce more he sues to God for grace\r\n‘O Thou, true Father of us all,\r\nWho hatest lies, who erst did call\r\nThe buried Lazarus from the grave,\r\nAnd Daniel from the lions save,\r\nFrom all the perils I deserve\r\nFor sinful life my soul preserve!’\r\nThen to his God outstretcheth he\r\nThe glove from his right hand; and, see!\r\nSt. Gabriel taketh it instantly.\r\nGod sends a cherub-angel bright,\r\nAnd Michael, Saint of Peril hight;\r\nAnd Gabriel comes; up, up they rise,\r\nAnd bear the Count to Paradise.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is useless to carry these quotations any further; they are sufficient\r\nto give an idea of the grand character of the poem in which so many\r\ntraits of really touching affection and so many bursts of patriotic\r\ndevotion and pious resignation are mingled with the merest brute courage.\r\nSuch, in its chief works, philosophical, historical, and poetical, was\r\nthe literature which the middle ages bequeathed to the reign of\r\nFrancis I.  In history only, and in spite of the new character assumed\r\nafterwards by the French language, this literature has had the honor of\r\npreserving its nationality and its glory.  Villehardouin, Joinville,\r\nFroissart, and Commynes have remained great writers.  In philosophy and\r\nin poesy a profound revolution was approaching; the religious reform and\r\nthe fine literary genius as well as the grand French language of the\r\nseventeenth century were preparing to rise above the intellectual\r\nhorizon.  But between the moment when such advances dawn and that when\r\nthey burst forth there is nearly always a period of uncertain and\r\nunfruitful transition: and such was the first half of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, that is to say, the actual reign of Francis I.; it is often\r\ncalled the reign of the Renaissance, which certainly originated in his\r\nreign, but it did not grow and make any display until after him; the\r\nreligious, philosophical, and poetical revolution, Calvin, Montaigne, and\r\nRonsard, born in the earlier half of the seventeenth century, did not do\r\nanything that exercised any power until the later.  One single poet, a\r\nthird-rate one, Clement Marot, attained lustre under Francis I.  Rabelais\r\nis the only great prose writer who belongs strictly to that period.  The\r\nscholars, the learned critics of what had been left by antiquity in\r\ngeneral and by Greek and Roman antiquity in particular, Bude (Budaeus),\r\nJ. C. Scaliger; Muretus, Danes (Danesius), Arnyot, Ramus (Peter la\r\nRamee), Robert Estienne (Stephanus), Vatable (Watebled), Cujas, and\r\nTurnebius make up the tale of literature specially belonging to and\r\noriginating in the reign of Francis I., just as the foundation of the\r\nCollege Royal, which became the College de France, is his chief personal\r\nclaim to renown in the service of science and letters.\r\n\r\nLet us return to the poets of the actual reign of Francis I.  The first\r\nwe encounter speaks thus of himself:--\r\n\r\n“I am not rich; that, certes, I confess;\r\nBut, natheless, well born and nobly bred;\r\nI’m read by both the people and noblesse,\r\nThroughout the world: ‘That’s Clement,’ it is said.\r\nMen live their span; but I shall ne’er be dead.\r\nAnd thou--thou hast thy meadow, well, and spring,\r\nWood, field, and castle--all that wealth can bring.\r\nThere’s just that difference ‘twixt thee and me.\r\nBut what I am thou couldst not be: the thing\r\nThou art, why, anybody else might be.”\r\n\r\nNow who was this who, with perfect confidence, indulged in such proud\r\nlanguage?  Was it a Homer, a Dante, a Corneille, one of those great\r\npoetical geniuses whose works can move a whole people, are addressed to\r\nall the world, and “will live forever”?  No; it was a poet of the court\r\nand of the fashionable world of Paris, of Blois, and of Amboise, in the\r\nsixteenth century, a groom-of-the-chamber to Marguerite de Valois, and\r\none of Francis I.’s favorites, who had written elegies, eclogues,\r\nepistles, complaints, roundelays, and epigrams on the incidents and for\r\nhis masters and mistresses of the hour; France owed to him none of those\r\ngreat poetical works consecrated to description of the grand destinies\r\nand grand passions of man, and to the future as well as to the writer’s\r\nown time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Clement Marot----162]\r\n\r\nClemont Marot, the son of a petty burgess of Cahors, named John Marot,\r\nhimself a poet in a small way, who had lived some time at the court of\r\nLouis XII., under the patronage of Queen Anne of Bretagne, had a right to\r\nstyle himself, “well born and nobly bred;” many of the petty burgesses of\r\nCahors were of noble origin, and derived therefrom certain privileges;\r\nJohn Marot, by a frugal and regular life, had acquired and left to his\r\nson two estates in the neighborhood of Cahors, where, no doubt, Clement\r\nresided but little, for he lived almost constantly at the court, or\r\nwandering about Europe, in every place where at one time the fortunes of\r\nthe king his protector and at another the storm of the nascent religious\r\nreform left him stranded willy-nilly.  He was present in 1525 at the\r\nbattle of Pavia, where he was wounded and taken prisoner with his king,\r\nbut soon released, since the Imperialists let go on easy terms gentlemen\r\nof whom it was impossible to make a rich booty.  From that time we do not\r\nmeet any more with Clement Marot in war or politics; to Marguerite de\r\nValois, to adventures of gallantry, and to success in his mundane line of\r\npoesy his life was thenceforth devoted.  The scandal of history has often\r\nbeen directed against his relations with his royal patroness; but there\r\nseems to be no real foundation for such a suspicion; the manners of the\r\nsixteenth century admitted of intimacies in language, and sometimes even\r\nof familiarities in procedure, contrasting strangely with demonstrations\r\nof the greatest respect, nay, humility.  Clement Marot was the king of\r\npoesy and set the fashion of wit in his time; Marguerite had a generous\r\nand a lively sympathy with wit, talent, success, renown; the princess and\r\nthe poet were mutually pleased with and flattered one another; and the\r\nliberties allowed to sympathy and flattery were great at that time, but\r\nfar less significant than they would be in our day.\r\n\r\nWhat were the cause, the degree, and the real value of this success and\r\nthis renown of which Clement Marot made so much parade, and for which his\r\ncontemporaries gave him credit?  What change, what progress effected by\r\nhim, during his lifetime, in French literature and the French language\r\nwon for him the place he obtained and still holds in the opinion of the\r\nlearned?\r\n\r\nA poet who no more than Clement Marot produced any great poetical work,\r\nand was very different from him in their small way, Francis Villon, in\r\nfact, preceded him by about three quarters of a century.  The most\r\ndistinguished amongst the literary critics of our time have discussed the\r\nquestion as to which of the two, Villon or Marot, should be regarded as\r\nthe last poet of the middle ages and the first of modern France.\r\nM. Sainte-Beuve, without attempting to precisely solve that little\r\nproblem, has distinguished and characterized the two poets with so much\r\nof truth and tact that there can be no hesitation about borrowing his\r\nwords: “Was Villon,” is the question he puts to himself, “an originator?\r\nDid he create a style of poesy?  Had he any idea of a literary reaction,\r\nas we should say nowadays?  What is quite certain is, that he possessed\r\noriginal talent; that amidst all the execrable tricks wherein he\r\ndelighted and wherein he was a master, he possessed the sacred spark.\r\n.  .  .  A licentious scamp of a student, bred at some shop in the Cite\r\nor the Place Maubert, he has a tone which, at least as much as that of\r\nRegnier, has a savor of the places the author frequented.  The beauties\r\nwhom he celebrates--and I blush for him--are none else than _la blanche\r\nSavetiere_ (the fair cobbleress), or _la gente Saul cissiere, du coin_\r\n(the pretty Sausage girl at the corner).  But he has invented for some of\r\nthose natural regrets which incessantly recur in respect of vanished\r\nbeauty and the flight of years a form of expression, truthful, charming,\r\nand airy, which goes on singing forever in the heart and ear of whosoever\r\nhas once heard it.  He has flashes, nothing more than flashes, of\r\nmelancholy.  .  .  .  It is in reading the verses of Clement Marot that\r\nwe have, for the first time as it seems to me, a very clear and distinct\r\nfeeling of having got out from the circumbendibus of the old language,\r\nfrom the Gallic tangle.  We are now in France, in the land and amidst the\r\nlanguage of France, in the region of genuine French wit, no longer that\r\nof the boor, or of the student, or of the burgess, but of the court and\r\ngood society.  Good society, in poesy, was born with Marot, with Francis\r\nI., and his sister Marguerite, with the Renaissance: much will still have\r\nto be done to bring it to perfection, but it exists and will never cease\r\nagain.  .  .  .  Marot, a poet of wits rather than of genius or of great\r\ntalent, but full of grace and breeding, who has no passion, but is not\r\ndevoid of sensibility, has a way of his own of telling and saying things;\r\nhe has a turn of his own; he is, in a word, the agreeable man, the\r\ngentleman-like man, who is bound to be pleasant and amusing, and who\r\ndischarges his duty with an easy air and unexceptionable gallantry.”\r\n\r\nThere we have exactly the new character which Marot, coming between\r\nVillon and Ronsard, gave in the sixteenth century to French poesy.  We\r\nmay be more exacting than M. Sainte-Beuve; we may regret that Marot,\r\nwhilst rescuing it from the streets, confined it too much to the court;\r\nthe natural and national range of poesy is higher and more extensive than\r\nthat; the Hundred Years’ War and Joan of Arc had higher claims.  But it\r\nis something to have delivered poesy from coarse vulgarity, and\r\nintroduced refinement into it.  Clement Marot rendered to the French\r\nlanguage, then in labor of progression, and, one might say, of formation,\r\neminent service: he gave it a naturalness, a clearness, an easy swing,\r\nand, for the most part, a correctness which it had hitherto lacked.  It\r\nwas reserved for other writers, in verse and prose, to give it boldness,\r\nthe richness that comes of precision, elevation, and grandeur.\r\n\r\nIn 1534, amidst the first violent tempest of reform in France, Clement\r\nMarot, accused of heresy, prudently withdrew and went to seek an asylum\r\nat Ferrara, under the protection of the duchess, Renee of France,\r\ndaughter of Louis XII.  He there met Calvin, who already held a high\r\nposition amongst the Reformers, and who was then engaged on a translation\r\nof the Psalms in verse.  The reformer talked to the poet about this grand\r\nHebrew poesy, which, according to M. Villemain’s impression, “has\r\ndefrayed in sublime coin the demands of human imagination.”  Marot, on\r\nreturning to France, found the College Royal recently instituted there,\r\nand the learned Vatable [Francis Watebled, born at Gamaches, in Picardy,\r\ndied at Paris in 1547] teaching Hebrew with a great attendance of pupils\r\nand of the curious.  The professor engaged the poet to translate the\r\nPsalms, he himself expounding them to him word by word.  Marot translated\r\nthirty of them, and dedicated them to Francis I., who not only accepted\r\nthe dedication, but recommended the work and the author to Charles V.,\r\nwho was at that time making a friendly passage through France on his way\r\nto put down the insurrection at Ghent.  “Charles V. accepted the said\r\ntranslation graciously” [as appears by a letter in 1559 to Catherine de’\r\nMedici from Villemadon, one of Marguerite of Navarre’s confidential\r\nservants], “commended it both by words and by a present of two hundred\r\ndoubloons, which he made to Marot, thus giving him courage to translate\r\nthe rest of the Psalms, and praying him to send him as soon as possible\r\nthe Psalm _Confitemini Domino, quoniam bonus_ [Trust in the Lord, for He\r\nis good], so fond was he of it.”  Singular fellow-feeling between Charles\r\nV. and his great adversary Luther, who said of that same psalm, “It is\r\nmy friend; it has saved me in many a strait from which emperor, kings,\r\nsages, nor saints could have delivered me!”  Clement Marot, thus aided\r\nand encouraged in this work which gave pleasure to Francis I. and Charles\r\nV., and must have been still more interesting to Calvin and Luther,\r\nprosecuted his work and published in 1541 the first thirty psalms; three\r\nyears afterwards, in 1543, he added twenty others, and dedicated the\r\ncollection “to the ladies of France,” in an epistle wherein the following\r\nverses occur:\r\n\r\n\r\n“Happy the man whose favored ear\r\nIn golden days to come shall hear\r\nThe ploughman, as he tills the ground,\r\nThe tarter, as he drives his round,\r\nThe shopman, as his task he plies,\r\nWith psalms or sacred melodies\r\nWhiling the hours of toil away!\r\nO, happy he who hears the lay\r\nOf shepherd and of shepherdess,\r\nAs in the woods they sing and bless,\r\nAnd make the rocks and pools proclaim\r\nWith them their great Creator’s name!\r\nO, can ye brook that God invite\r\nThem before you to such delight?\r\nBegin, ladies, begin!  .  .  .”\r\n\r\n\r\nA century after Marot’s time, in 1649, a pious and learned Catholic,\r\nGodeau, Bishop of Grasse and member of the nascent French Academy, was in\r\nhis turn translating the Psalms, and rendered full justice to the labors\r\nof the poet, his predecessor, and to the piety of the Reformers, in the\r\nfollowing terms “Those whose separation from the church we deplore have\r\nrendered the version they make use of famous by the pleasing airs that\r\nlearned musicians set them to when they were composed.  To know them by\r\nheart is, amongst them, a sign of the communion to which they belong, and\r\nin the towns in which they are most numerous the airs may be heard coming\r\nfrom the mouths of artisans, and in the country from those of tillers.”\r\n\r\nIn 1555, eight years after the death of Francis I., Estienne Pasquier\r\nwrote to Ronsard, “In good faith, there was never seen in France such a\r\nglut of poets.  I fear that in the long run people will weary of them.\r\nBut it is a vice peculiar to us that as soon as we see anything\r\nsucceeding prosperously for any one, everybody wants to join in.”\r\n Estienne Pasquier’s fear was much better grounded after the death of\r\nFrancis I., and when Ronsard had become the head of the poet-world, than\r\nit would have been in the first half of the sixteenth century.  During\r\nthe reign of Francis I. and after the date of Clement Marot, there is no\r\npoet of any celebrity to speak of, unless we except Francis I. himself\r\nand his sister Marguerite; and it is only in compliment to royalty’s name\r\nthat they need be spoken of.  They, both of them, had evidently a mania\r\nfor versifying, even in their most confidential communications, for many\r\nof their letters to one another, those during the captivity of Francis I.\r\nat Madrid amongst the rest, are written in verse; but their verses are\r\ndevoid of poesy; they are prose, often long-winded and frigid, and\r\nsometimes painfully labored.  There is, however, a distinction to be made\r\nbetween the two correspondents.  In the letters and verses of Marguerite\r\nthere is seen gleaming forth here and there a sentiment of truth and\r\ntenderness, a free and graceful play of fancy.  We have three collections\r\nof her writings: 1. her _Heptameron, ou les Sept Journees de la Reine de\r\nNavarre,_ a collection of sixty-eight tales more or less gallant,\r\npublished for the first time in 1558, without any author’s name; 2.  her\r\n_OEuvres poetiques,_ which appeared at Lyons in 1547 and 1548, in\r\nconsequence of her being alive, under the title of _Les Marguerites de la\r\nMarguerite des Princesses_ (the Pearls of the Pearl of Princesses), and\r\nof which one of her grooms of the chamber was editor; in addition to\r\nwhich there is a volume of _Poesies inedites,_ collected by order of\r\nMarguerite herself, but written by the hand of her secretary John Frotte,\r\nand preserved at Paris amongst the manuscripts of the Bibliotheque\r\nnationale; 3.  the Collection of her Letters, published in 1841, by M. F.\r\nGenin.  This last collection is, morally as well as historically, the\r\nmost interesting of the three.  As for Francis I. himself, there is\r\nlittle, if anything, known of his posies beyond those which have been\r\ninserted in the _Documents relatifs a sa Captivite a Madrid,_ published\r\nin 1847 by M. Champollion-Figeac; some have an historical value, either\r\nas regards public events or Francis I.’s relations towards his mother,\r\nhis sister, and his mistresses; the most important is a long account of\r\nhis campaign, in 1525, in Italy, and of the battle of Pavia; but the\r\nking’s verses have even less poetical merit than his sister’s.\r\n\r\nFrancis I.’s good will did more for learned and classical literature than\r\nfor poesy.  Attention has already been drawn to the names of the\r\nprincipal masters in the great learned and critical school which devoted\r\nitself, in this reign, to the historical, chronological, philological,\r\nbiographical, and literary study of Greek and Roman antiquity, both Pagan\r\nand Christian.  It is to the labors of this school and to their results\r\nthat the word Renaissance is justly applied, and that the honor is\r\nespecially to be referred of the great intellectual progress made in the\r\nsixteenth century.  Francis I. contributed to this progress, first by the\r\nintelligent sympathy he testified towards learned men of letters, and\r\nafterwards by the foundation of the _College Royal,_ an establishment of\r\na special, an elevated, and an independent sort, where professors found a\r\nliberty protected against the routine, jealousy, and sometimes\r\nintolerance of the University of Paris and the Sorbonne.  The king and\r\nhis sister Marguerite often went to pay a visit, at his printing-place in\r\nSt. Jean de Beauvais Street, to Robert Estienne (Stephanus), the most\r\ncelebrated amongst that family of printer-publishers who had so much to\r\ndo with the resurrection of ancient literature.  It is said that one day\r\nthe king waited a while in the work-room, so as not to disturb Robert\r\nEstienne in the correction of a proof.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Francis I. waits for Robert Estienne----168]\r\n\r\nWhen the violence bred of religious quarrels finally forced the learned\r\nand courageous printer to expatriate himself, his first care was to say,\r\nat the head of his apology, “When I take account of the war I have\r\ncarried on with the Sorbonne for a space of twenty years or thereabouts,\r\nI cannot sufficiently marvel how so small and broken-down a creature as I\r\nam had strength to maintain it.  When I was seen being harried on all\r\nsides, how often have I been the talk on street and at banquets, whilst\r\npeople said, ‘It is all over with him; he is caught, he cannot escape;\r\neven if the king would, he could not save him.’ .  .  .  I wish to\r\njustify myself against the reproach of having left my country, to the\r\nhurt of the public weal, and of not having acknowledged the great\r\nliberality displayed towards me by the king; since it was a high honor\r\nfor me that the king, having deigned to make me his printer, always kept\r\nme under his protection, in the face of all who envied me and wished me\r\nill, and never ceased to aid me graciously in all sorts of ways.”\r\n\r\nThe _College Royal,_ no less than Robert Estienne, met with obstacles and\r\nill-wishers; it was William Bude (Budeaus) who first suggested the idea\r\nof the college to the king, primarily with the limited purpose of\r\nsecuring instruction in Greek and Hebrew, after the fashion of the\r\nCollege of Young Grecians and the College of the Three Languages (the\r\nTrilingual, Hebrew, Greek, and Latin), of which the former was founded at\r\nRome by Leo X., the latter at Louvain by Canon Jerome Busleyden.  Francis\r\nI. readily surrendered himself to more magnificent projects; he was\r\nanxious to erect a splendid building on the site of the Hotel de Nesle,\r\nand to put Erasmus at the head of the College Royal.  War incessantly\r\nrenewed and the nascent religious troubles interfered with his\r\nresolutions; but William Bude never ceased to urge upon the king an\r\nextension of the branches of learning in the establishment; and after the\r\nPeace of Cambrai in 1529, chairs of mathematics, Oriental languages,\r\nLatin oratory, Greek and Latin philosophy, and medicine were successively\r\nadded to the chairs of Hebrew and Greek which had been the original\r\nnucleus of instruction in the College Royal.  It continued to be an\r\nobject of suspicion to the Sorbonne and of hesitation in the Parliament,\r\nto which royalty had recourse against the attacks of its adversaries.\r\nBut it had no lack of protectors, nevertheless: the Cardinal of Lorraine,\r\nCharles IX., and Catherine de’ Medici herself supported it in its trials;\r\nand Francis I. had the honor of founding a great school of the higher\r\nsort of education, a school, which, throughout all the religious\r\ndissensions and all the political revolutions of France, has kept its\r\nposition and independence, whatever may have been elsewhere, in the\r\nmatter of public instruction, the system and the regimen of state\r\nestablishments.\r\n\r\nA few words have already been said about the development of the arts,\r\nespecially architecture and sculpture, in the middle ages, and of the\r\ncharacteristics, original and national, Gallic and Christian, which\r\nbelonged to them at this period, particularly in respect of their\r\ninnumerable churches, great and small.  A foreglance has been given of\r\nthe alteration which was brought about in those characteristics, at the\r\ndate of the sixteenth century, by the Renaissance, at the same time that\r\nthe arts were made to shine with fresh and vivid lustre.  Francis I. was\r\ntheir zealous and lavish patron; he revelled in building and embellishing\r\npalaces, castles, and hunting-boxes, St. Germain, Chenonceaux,\r\nFontainebleau, and Chambord; his chief councillors, Chancellor Duprat and\r\nAdmiral Bonnivet, shared his taste and followed his example; several\r\nprovinces, and the banks of the Loire especially, became covered with\r\nsplendid buildings, bearing the marks of a complicated character which\r\nsmacked of imitations from abroad.  Italy, which, from the time of\r\nCharles VIII. and Louis XII., had been the object of French kings’\r\nambition and the scene of French wars, became also the school of French\r\nart; national and solemn Christian traditions were blended, whilst taking\r\nan altered form, with the Italian resuscitation of Greek and Roman\r\nantiquity.  Italian artists, such as Rosso of Florence, Primatice of\r\nBologna, Niccolo dell’ Abbate of Modena, and Benvenuto Cellini of\r\nFlorence, came and settled in France, and there inspired and carried out\r\nthe king’s projects and works.  Leonardo da Vinci, full of years and\r\ndiscontented with his Italian patrons, accompanied Francis I. to France,\r\nand died in his arms at the castle of Clou, near Amboise, where he had\r\nfixed his residence.  Some great French artists, such as the painter John\r\nCousin and the sculptor John Goujon, strove ably to uphold the original\r\ncharacter and merits of French art; but they could not keep themselves\r\nentirely aloof from the influence of this brilliant Italian art, for\r\nwhich Francis I.’s successors, even more than he, showed a zealous and\r\nrefined attachment, but of which he was, in France, the first patron.\r\n\r\nWe will not quit the first half of the sixteenth century and the literary\r\nand philosophical Renaissance which characterizes that period, without\r\nassigning a place therein at its proper date and in his proper rank to\r\nthe name, the life, and the works of the man who was not only its most\r\noriginal and most eminent writer, but its truest and most vivid\r\nrepresentative, Rabelais.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rabelais----171]\r\n\r\nFrancis Rabelais, who was born at Chinon in 1495, and died at Paris in\r\n1553, wandered during those fifty-eight years about France and Europe\r\nfrom town to town, from profession to profession, from good to bad and\r\nfrom bad to good estate; first a monk of the Cordeliers; then, with Pope\r\nClement VII.’s authority, a Benedictine; then putting off the monk’s\r\nhabit and assuming that of a secular priest in order to roam the world,\r\n“incurring,” as he himself says, “in this vagabond life, the double\r\nstigma of suspension from orders and apostasy;” then studying medicine at\r\nMontpellier; then medical officer of the great hospital at Lyons, but,\r\nbefore long, superseded in that office “for having been twice absent\r\nwithout leave;” then staying at Lyons as a corrector of proofs, a\r\ncompiler of almanacs, an editor of divers books for learned patrons, and\r\ncommencing the publication of his _Vie tres-horrifique du grand\r\nGargantua, pere de Pantagruel_ (Most horrifying life of the great\r\nGargantua, father of Pantagruel), which was immediately proceeded against\r\nby the Sorbonne “as an obscene tale.”  On grounds of prudence or\r\nnecessity Rabelais then quitted Lyons and set out for Rome as physician\r\nattached to the household of Cardinal John Du Bellay, Bishop of Paris and\r\nenvoy from France to the Holy See; the which bishop “having relished the\r\nprofound learning and competence of Rabelais, and having, besides,\r\ndiscovered in him fine humor and a conversation capable of diverting the\r\nblackest melancholy, retained him near his person in the capacity of\r\nphysician in ordinary to himself and all his family, and held him ever\r\nafterwards in high esteem.”  After two years passed at Rome, and after\r\nrendering all sorts of service in his patron’s household, Rabelais,\r\n“feeling that the uproarious life he was leading and his licentious deeds\r\nwere unworthy of a man of religion and a priest,” asked Pope Paul III.\r\nfor absolution, and at the same time permission to resume the habit of\r\nSt. Benedict, and to practise “for piety’s sake, without hope of gain and\r\nin any and every place,” the art of medicine, wherein he had taken, he\r\nsaid, the degrees of bachelor, licentiate, and doctor.  A brief of Pope\r\nPaul III.’s, dated January 17, 1536, granted his request.  Seventeen\r\nmonths afterwards, on the 22d of May, 1537, Rabelais reappears at\r\nMontpellier, and there receives, it is said, the degree of doctor, which\r\nhe had already taken upon himself to assume.  He pursues his life of\r\nmingled science and adventure, gives lessons, and gads about so much that\r\n“his doctor’s gown and cap are preserved at Montpellier, according to\r\ntradition, all dirty and torn, but objects of respectful reminiscence.”\r\n In 1538 Rabelais leaves Montpellier, and goes to practise medicine at\r\nNarbonne, Castres, and Lyons.  In 1540 he tires of it, resumes, as he had\r\nauthority to do, the habit of a canon of St. Maur, and settles in that\r\nresidence, “a paradise,” as he himself says, “of salubrity, amenity,\r\nserenity, convenience, and all the chaste pleasures of agriculture and\r\ncountry-life.”  Between 1540 and 1551 he is, nevertheless, found once\r\nmore wandering, far away from this paradise, in France, Italy, and,\r\nperhaps, England; he completes and publishes, under his own name, the\r\n_Faits et Dicts heroiques de Pantagruel,_ and obtains from Francis I. a\r\nfaculty for the publication of “these two volumes not less useful than\r\ndelightful, which the printers had corrupted and perverted in many\r\npassages, to the great displeasure and detriment of the author, and to\r\nthe prejudice of readers.”  The work made a great noise; the Sorbonne\r\nresolved to attack it, in spite of the king’s approbation; but Francis I.\r\ndied on the 31st of March, 1547.  Rabelais relapsed into his life of\r\nembarrassment and vagabondage; on leaving France he had recourse, first\r\nat Metz and afterwards in Italy, to the assistance of his old and ever\r\nwell-disposed patron, Cardinal John Du Bellay.  On returning to France he\r\nobtained from the new king, Henry II., a fresh faculty for the printing\r\nof his books “in Greek, Latin, and Tuscan;” and, almost at the same time,\r\non the 18th of January, 1551, Cardinal Du Bellay, Bishop of Paris,\r\nconferred upon him the cure of St. Martin at Meudon, “which he\r\ndischarged,” says his biographer Colletet, “with all the sincerity, all\r\nthe uprightness, and all the charity that can be expected of a man who\r\nwishes to do his duty, and to the satisfaction of his flock.”\r\n Nevertheless, when the new holder of the cure at Meudon, shortly after\r\nhis installation, made up his mind to publish the fourth book of the\r\n_Faits et Dicts heroiques du bon Pantagruel,_ the work was censured by\r\nthe Sorbonne and interdicted by decree of Parliament, and authority to\r\noffer it for sale was not granted until, on the 9th of February, 1552,\r\nRabelais had given in his resignation of his cure at Meudon, and of\r\nanother cure which he possessed, under the title of benefice, in the\r\ndiocese of Le Mans.  He retired in bad health to Paris, where he died\r\nshortly afterwards, in 1553, “in Rue des Jardins, parish of St. Paul, in\r\nthe cemetery whereof he was interred,” says Colletet, “close to a large\r\ntree which was still to be seen a few years ago.”\r\n\r\nSuch a life, this constant change of position, profession, career, taste,\r\npatron, and residence, bore a strong resemblance to what we should\r\nnowadays call a Bohemian life; and everything shows that Rabelais’\r\nhabits, without being scandalous, were not more regular or more dignified\r\nthan his condition in the world.  Had we no precise and personal\r\ninformation about him in this respect, still his literary work,\r\n_Gargantua and Pantagruel,_ would not leave us in any doubt: there is no\r\nprinted book, sketch, conversation, or story, which is more coarse and\r\ncynical, and which testifies, whether as regards the author or the public\r\nfor whom the work is intended, to a more complete and habitual\r\ndissoluteness in thought, morals, and language.  There is certainly no\r\nground for wondering that the Sorbonne, in proceeding against the _Vie\r\ntres-horrifique du grand Gargantua, pere de Pantagruel,_ should have\r\ndescribed it as “an obscene tale;” and the whole part of Panurge, the\r\nbrilliant talker of the tale,\r\n\r\n     “Take him for all in all the best boy in the world,”\r\n\r\nfully justifies the Sorbonne.  But, by way of striking contrast, at the\r\nsame time that the works of Rabelais attest the irregularity of men’s\r\nlives and minds, they also reveal the great travail that is going on and\r\nthe great progress that has already been made in the intellectual\r\ncondition of his day, in the influence of natural and legitimate\r\nfeelings, and in the appreciation of men’s mutual rights and duties.\r\nSixty-two years ago M. Guizot published, in a periodical collection\r\nentitled _Annales de l’Education,_ a Study of Rabelais’ ideas compared\r\nwith the practice and routine of his day in respect of Education; an\r\nimportant question in the sixteenth as it is in the nineteenth century.\r\nIt will be well to quote here from that Study certain fragments which\r\nwill give some notion of what new ideas and tendencies were making their\r\nway into the social life of France, and were coincident with that great\r\nreligious and political ferment which was destined to reach\r\nbursting-point in the reign of Francis I., and to influence for nearly\r\na century the fortunes of France.\r\n\r\n“It was no easy matter,” were the words used by M. Guizot in 1811, “to\r\nspeak reasonably about education at the time when Rabelais wrote.  There\r\nwas then no idea of home-education and the means of rendering it\r\npracticable.  As to public education, there was no extensive range and\r\nnothing really useful to the community in the instruction received by\r\nchildren at college; no justice and no humanity in the treatment they\r\nexperienced; a fruitless and ridiculously prolonged study of words\r\nsucceeded by a no less fruitless study of interminable subtilties, and\r\nall this fruitless knowledge driven into the brains of children by help\r\nof chastisements, blows, and that barbarous severity which seems to\r\nregard the _Compelle intrare_ as the principal law and object of\r\ninstruction.  How proceed, in such a state of things, to conceive a plan\r\nof liberal, gentle, and reasonable education?  Rabelais, in his book,\r\nhad begun by avoiding the danger of directly shocking received ideas;\r\nby transporting both himself and his heroes to the regions of imagination\r\nand extravagance he had set himself at liberty to bring them up in quite\r\na different fashion than that of his times; the rectors of colleges could\r\nnot pretend that Pantagruel, who was hardly born before he sucked down at\r\nevery meal the milk of four thousand six hundred cows, and for whose\r\nfirst shirt there had been cut nine hundred ells of Chatellerault linen,\r\nwas a portrait of any of the little boys who trembled at their ferules.\r\n. . .  Pantagruel is in his cradle; he is bound and swathed in it like\r\nall children at that time; but, ere long, Gargantua, his father,\r\nperceives that these bands are constraining his movements, and that he is\r\nmaking efforts to burst there; he immediately, by advice of the princes\r\nand lords present, orders the said shackles to be undone, and lo!\r\nPantagruel is no longer uneasy.  .  .  .  And thus became he big and\r\nstrong full early.  .  .  .  There came, however, the time when his\r\ninstruction must begin.  ‘My will,’ said Gargantua, ‘is to hand him over\r\nto some learned man for to indoctrinate him according to his capacity,\r\nand to spare nothing to that end.’  He, accordingly, put Pantagruel under\r\na great teacher, who began by bringing him up after the fashion of those\r\ntimes.  He taught him his charte (alphabet) to such purpose that he could\r\nsay it by heart backwards, and he was five years and three months about\r\nit.  Then he read with him Donotus and Facetus (old elementary works on\r\nLatin grammar), and he was thirteen years, six months, and two weeks over\r\nthat.  Then he read with him the De Modis significandi, with the\r\ncommentaries of Hurtebisius, Fasquin, and a heap of others, and he was\r\nmore than eighteen years and eleven months over them, and knew them so\r\nwell that he proved on his fingers to his mother that _de modis\r\nsignifieandi non erat scientia_.  After so much labor and so many years,\r\nwhat did Pantagruel know?  Gargantua was no bigot: he did not shut his\r\neyes that he might not see, and he believed what his eyes told him.  He\r\nsaw that Pantagruel worked very hard and spent all his time at it, and\r\nyet he got no good by it.  And what was worse, he was becoming daft,\r\nsilly, dreamy, and besotted through it.  So Pantagruel was taken away\r\nfrom his former masters and handed over to Ponocrates, a teacher of quite\r\na different sort, who was bidden to take him to Paris to make a new\r\ncreature of him and complete his education there.  Ponocrates was very\r\ncareful not to send him to any college.  Rabelais, as it appears, had a\r\nspecial aversion for Montaigu College.  ‘Tempeste,’ says he, ‘was a great\r\nboy-flogger at Montaigu College.  If for flogging poor little children,\r\nunoffending school-boys, pedagogues are damned, he, upon my word of\r\nhonor, is now on Ixion’s wheel, flogging the dock-tailed cur that turns\r\nit.’  Pantagruel’s education was now humane and gentle.  Accordingly he\r\nsoon took pleasure in the work which Ponocrates was at the pains of\r\nrendering interesting to him by the very nature and the variety of the\r\nsubjects of it.  .  .  .  Is it not a very remarkable phenomenon that at\r\nsuch a time and in such a condition of public instruction a man should\r\nhave had sufficient sagacity not only to regard the natural sciences as\r\none of the principal subjects of study which ought to be included in a\r\ncourse of education, but further to make the observation of nature the\r\nbasis of that study, to fix the pupil’s attention upon examination of\r\nfacts, and to impress upon him the necessity of applying his knowledge by\r\nstudying those practical arts and industries which profit by such\r\napplications?  That, however, Rabelais did, probably by dint of sheer\r\ngood sense, and without having any notion himself about the wide bearing\r\nof his ideas.  Ponocrates took Pantagruel through a course of what we\r\nshould nowadays call practical study of the exact and natural sciences as\r\nthey were understood in the sixteenth century; but, at the same time, far\r\nfrom forgetting the moral sciences, he assigns to them, for each day, a\r\ndefinite place and an equally practical character.  ‘As soon as\r\nPantagruel was up,’ he says, ‘some page or other of the sacred Scripture\r\nwas read with him aloud and distinctly, with pronunciation suited to the\r\nsubject.  .  .  .  In accordance with the design and purport of this\r\nlesson, he at frequent intervals devoted himself to doing reverence and\r\nsaying prayers to the good God, whose majesty and marvellous judgments\r\nwere shown forth in what was read.  .  .  .  When evening came, he and\r\nhis teacher briefly recapitulated together, after the manner of the\r\nPythagoreans, all that he had read, seen, learned, and heard in the\r\ncourse of the whole day.  They prayed to God the Creator, worshipping\r\nHim, glorifying Him for his boundless goodness, giving Him thanks for all\r\nthe time that was past, and commending themselves to His divine mercy for\r\nall that was to come.  This done, they went to their rest.’  And at the\r\nend of this course of education, so complete both from the worldly and\r\nthe religious point of view, Rabelais shows us young Pantagruel living in\r\naffectionate and respectful intimacy with his father Gargantua, who, as\r\nhe sees him off on his travels, gives him these last words of advice:\r\nScience without conscience is nought but ruin to the soul; it behooves\r\nthee to serve, love, and fear God.  Have thou in suspicion the abuses of\r\nthe world; set not thine heart on vanity, for this life is transitory,\r\nbut the word of God abideth forever. Reverence thy teachers; flee the\r\ncompany of those whom thou wouldest not resemble.  .  .  .  And when thou\r\nfeelest sure that thou hast acquired all that is to be learned yonder,\r\nreturn to me that I may see thee and give thee my blessing ere I die.’”\r\n\r\nAfter what was said above about the personal habits and the works of\r\nRabelais, these are certainly not the ideas, sentiments, and language one\r\nwould expect to find at the end and as the conclusion of his life and his\r\nbook.  And it is precisely on account of this contrast that more space\r\nhas been accorded in this history to the man and his book than would in\r\nthe natural course of things have been due to them.  At bottom and,\r\nbeyond their mere appearances the life and the book of Rabelais are a\r\ntrue and vivid reflection of the moral and social ferment characteristic\r\nof his time.  A time of innovation and of obstruction, of corruption and\r\nof regeneration, of decay and of renaissance, all at once.  A deeply\r\nserious crisis in a strong and complicated social system, which had been\r\nhitherto exposed to the buffets and the risks of brute force, but was\r\nintellectually full of life and aspiration, was in travail of a double\r\nyearning for reforming itself and setting itself in order, and did\r\nindeed, in the sixteenth century, attempt at one and the same time a\r\nreligious and a political reformation, the object whereof, missed as it\r\nwas at that period, is still at the bottom of all true Frenchmen’s trials\r\nand struggles.  This great movement of the sixteenth century we are now\r\nabout to approach, and will attempt to fix its character with precision\r\nand mark the imprint of its earliest steps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.----FRANCIS I. AND THE REFORMATION.\r\n\r\nNearly half a century before the Reformation made any noise in France it\r\nhad burst out with great force and had established its footing in\r\nGermany, Switzerland, and England.  John Huss and Jerome of Prague, both\r\nborn in Bohemia, one in 1373 and the other in 1378, had been condemned as\r\nheretics and burned at Constance, one in 1415 and the other in 1416, by\r\ndecree and in the presence of the council which had been there assembled.\r\nBut, at the commencement of the sixteenth century, Luther in Germany and\r\nZwingle in Switzerland had taken in hand the work of the Reformation, and\r\nbefore half that century had rolled by they had made the foundations of\r\ntheir new church so strong that their powerful adversaries, with Charles\r\nV. at their head, felt obliged to treat with them and recognize their\r\nposition in the European world, though all the while disputing their\r\nright.  In England, Henry VIII., under the influence of an unbridled\r\npassion, as all his passions were, for Anna Boleyn, had, in 1531, broken\r\nwith the church of Rome, whose pope, Clement VII., refused very properly\r\nto pronounce him divorced from his wife Catherine of Aragon, and the king\r\nhad proclaimed himself the spiritual head of the English church without\r\nmeeting either amongst his clergy or in his kingdom with any effectual\r\nopposition.  Thus in these three important states of Western Europe the\r\nReformers had succeeded, and the religious revolution was in process of\r\naccomplishment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The First Protestants----178]\r\n\r\nIn France it was quite otherwise.  Not that, there too, there were not\r\namongst Christians profound dissensions and ardent desires for religious\r\nreform.  We will dwell directly upon its explosion, its vicissitudes, and\r\nits characteristics.  But France did not contain, as Germany did, several\r\ndistinct states, independent and pretty strong, though by no means\r\nequally so, which could offer to the different creeds a secure asylum,\r\nand could form one with another coalitions capable of resisting the head\r\nof that incohesive coalition which was called the empire of Germany.  In\r\nthe sixteenth century, on the contrary, the unity of the French monarchy\r\nwas established, and it was all, throughout its whole extent, subject to\r\nthe same laws and the same master, as regarded the religious bodies as\r\nwell as the body politic.  In this monarchy, however, there did not\r\nhappen to be, at the date of the sixteenth century, a sovereign audacious\r\nenough and powerful enough to gratify his personal passions at the cost\r\nof embroiling himself, like Henry VIII., with the spiritual head of\r\nChristendom, and, from the mere desire for a change of wife, to change\r\nthe regimen of the church in his dominions.  Francis I., on the contrary,\r\nhad scarcely ascended the throne when, by abolishing the Pragmatic\r\nSanction and signing the Concordat of 1516, he attached himself more\r\nclosely to the papacy.  The nascent Reformation, then, did not meet in\r\nFrance with either of the two important circumstances, politically\r\nconsidered, which in Germany and in England rendered its first steps more\r\neasy and more secure.  It was in the cause of religious creeds alone, and\r\nby means of moral force alone, that she had to maintain the struggles in\r\nwhich she engaged.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the sixteenth century, there lived, at a small castle\r\nnear Gap in Dauphiny, in the bosom of a noble and unostentatiously pious\r\nfamily, a young man of ardent imagination, fiery temperament, and\r\nenergetic character, who shared his relatives’ creeds and joined in their\r\ndevotions, but grew weary of the monotony of his thoughts and of his\r\nlife.  William Farel heard talk of another young man, his contemporary\r\nand neighbor, Peter du Terrail, even now almost famous under the name of\r\nBayard.  “Such sons,” was said in his hearing, “are as arrows in the hand\r\nof a giant; blessed is he who has his quiver full of them!”  Young Farel\r\npressed his father to let him go too and make himself a man in the world.\r\nThe old gentleman would willingly have permitted his son to take up such\r\na life as Bayard’s; but it was towards the University of Paris, “that\r\nmother of all the sciences, that pure and shining mirror of the faith,”\r\n that the young man’s aspirations were directed.  The father at first\r\nopposed, but afterwards yielded to his wishes; and, about 1510, William\r\nFarel quitted Gap and arrived at Paris.  The questions raised by the\r\ncouncils of Bale and Florence, and by the semi-political,\r\nsemi-ecclesiastical assembly at Tours, which had been convoked by Louis\r\nXII., the instruction at the Parisian University, and the attacks of the\r\nSorbonne on the study of Greek and Hebrew, branded as heresy, were\r\nproducing a lively agitation in the public mind.  A doctor of theology,\r\nalready advanced in years, of small stature, of mean appearance, and of\r\nlow origin, Jacques Lefevre by name, born at Etaples in Picardy, had for\r\nseventeen years filled with great success a professorship in the\r\nuniversity.  “Amongst many thousands of men,” said Erasmus, “you will not\r\nfind any of higher integrity and more versed in polite letters.”  “He is\r\nvery fond of me,” wrote Zwingle about him; “he is perfectly open and\r\ngood; he argues, he sings, he plays, and be laughs with me at the follies\r\nof the world.”  Some circumstance or other brought the young student and\r\nthe old scholar together; they liked one another, and soon became\r\nfriends.  Farel was impressed by his master’s devotion as well as\r\nlearning; he saw him on his knees at church praying fervently; and,\r\n“Never,” said he, “had I seen a chanter of mass who chanted it with\r\ndeeper reverence.”  But this old-fashioned piety did not interfere at all\r\nwith the freedom of the professor’s ideas and conversations touching\r\neither the abuses or the doctrines of the church.  “How shameful it is,”\r\n he would say, “to see a bishop soliciting people to drink with him,\r\ncaring for nought but gaming, constantly handling the dice and the\r\ndice-box, constantly hunting, hallooing after birds and game, frequenting\r\nbad houses!  .  .  .  Religion has but one foundation, but one end, but\r\none head, Jesus Christ blessed forever; he alone trod the wine-press.\r\nLet us not, then, call ourselves by the name of St. Paul, or Apollos, or\r\nSt. Peter.”  These free conversations worked, not all at once, but none\r\nthe less effectually, upon those who heard them.  “The end was,” says\r\nFarel, “that little by little the papacy slipped from its place in my\r\nheart; it did not come down at the first shock.”  At the same time that\r\nhe thus talked with his pupils, Lefevre of Etaples published a commentary\r\non the Epistles of St. Paul, and then a commentary on the Gospels.\r\n“Christians,” said he, “are those only who love Jesus Christ and His word.\r\nMay everything be illumined with His light!  Through it may there be a\r\nreturn of times like those of that primitive church which devoted to\r\nJesus Christ so many martyrs!  May the Lord of the harvest, foreseeing a\r\nnew harvest, send new and diligent laborers!  .  .  .  My dear William,”\r\n he added, turning to Farel and taking his hand, “God will renew the\r\nworld, and you will see it!”\r\n\r\nIt was not only professors and pupils, scholars grown old in meditation\r\nand young folks eager for truth, liberty, action, and renown, who\r\nwelcomed passionately those boundless and undefined hopes, those\r\nyearnings towards a brilliant and at the same time a vague future, at\r\nwhich they looked forward, according to the expression used by Lefevre\r\nof Etaples to Farel, to a “renewal of the world.”  Men holding a social\r\nposition very different from that of the philosophers, men with minds\r\nformed on an acquaintance with facts and in the practice of affairs,\r\ntook part in this intellectual and religious ferment, and protected and\r\nencouraged its fervent adherents.  William Briconnet, Bishop of Meaux, a\r\nprelate who had been Louis XII.’s ambassador to Pope Julius II., and one\r\namongst the negotiators of Francis I.’s Concordat with Leo X., opened his\r\ndiocese to the preachers and writers recommended to him by his friend\r\nLefevre of Staples, and supported them in their labors for the\r\ntranslation and propagation, amongst the people, of the Holy Scriptures.\r\nThey had at court, and near the king’s own person, the avowed support of\r\nhis sister, Princess Marguerite, who was beautiful, sprightly, affable,\r\nkind, disposed towards all lofty and humane sentiments as well as all\r\nintellectual pleasures, and an object of the sometimes rash attentions of\r\nthe most eminent and most different men of her time, Charles V., the\r\nConstable de Bourbon, Admiral Bonnivet, and Clement Marot.  Marguerite,\r\nwho was married to the Duke d’Alencon, widowed in 1525, and married a\r\nsecond time, in 1527, to Henry d’Albret, King of Navarre, was all her\r\nlife at Pau and at Nerac, as well as at Paris, a centre, a focus of\r\nsocial, literary, religious, and political movement.  “The king her\r\nbrother loved her dearly,” says Brantome, “and always called her his\r\ndarling.  .  .  Very often, when he had important business, he left it to\r\nher, waiting for her definitive and conclusive decision.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Castle of Pau----183]\r\n\r\nThe ambassadors who talked with her were enchanted by her, and always\r\nwent to see her after having paid their first ambassadorial visit.  She\r\nhad so great a regard and affection for the king, that when she heard of\r\nhis dangerous illness she said, ‘Whosoever shall come to my door, and\r\nannounce to me the recovery of the king my brother, such courier, should\r\nhe be tired, and worn out, and muddy, and dirty, I will go and kiss and\r\nembrace as if he were the sprucest prince and gentleman of France; and,\r\nshould he be in want of a bed and unable to find one whereon to rid him\r\nof his weariness, I would give him mine, and I would rather lie on the\r\nhard, for the good news he brought me.’ .  .  .  She was suspected of\r\ninclining to the religion of Luther, but she never made any profession or\r\nsign thereof; and, if she believed it, she kept it in her heart very\r\nsecret, inasmuch as the king did hate it sorely.”  .  .  .  “The heresy\r\nwas seen glimmering here and there,” says another contemporary witness\r\n[Florimond de Raimond in his _Histoire de l’Heresie_], “but it appeared\r\nand disappeared like a nightly meteor which has but a flickering\r\nbrightness.”--At bottom this reserve was quite in conformity with the\r\nmental condition of that class, or as one might he inclined to say, that\r\ncircle of Reformers at court.  Luther and Zwingle had distinctly declared\r\nwar on the papacy; Henry VIII. had with a flourish separated England from\r\nthe Romish church; Marguerite de Valois and Bishop Briconnet neither\r\nwished nor demanded so much; they aspired no further than to reform the\r\nabuses of the Romish church by the authority of that church itself, in\r\nconcert with its heads and according to its traditional regimen; they had\r\nno idea of more than dealing kindly, and even sympathetically, with the\r\nliberties and the progress of science and human intelligence.  Confined\r\nwithin these limits, the idea was legitimate and honest enough, but it\r\nshowed want of foresight, and was utterly vain.  When, whether in state\r\nor church, the vices and defects of government have lasted for ages and\r\nbecome habits not only inveterate but closely connected with powerful\r\npersonal interests, a day at last comes when the deplorable result is\r\nseen in pig-headedness and weakness.  Then there is an explosion of\r\ndeep-seated and violent shocks, from which infinitely more is expected\r\nthan they can accomplish, and which, even when they are successful, cost\r\nthe people very dear, for their success is sullied and incomplete.  A\r\ncertain amount of good government and general good sense is a necessary\r\npreface and preparation for any good sort of reform.  Happy the nations\r\nwho are spared by their wisdom or their good fortune the cruel trial of\r\nonly obtaining such reforms as they need when they have been reduced to\r\nprosecute them beneath the slings and arrows of outrageous revolution!\r\nChristian France in the sixteenth century was not so favorably situated.\r\n\r\nDuring the first years of Francis I.’s reign (from 1515 to 1520) young\r\nand ardent Reformers, such as William Farel and his friends, were but\r\nisolated individuals, eager after new ideas and studies, very favorable\r\ntowards all that came to them from Germany, but without any consistency\r\nyet as a party, and without having committed any striking act of\r\naggression against the Roman church.  Nevertheless they were even then,\r\nso far as the heads and the devoted adherents of that church were\r\nconcerned, objects of serious disquietude and jealous supervision.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: William Farel----181]\r\n\r\nThe Sorbonne, in particular, pronounced vehemently against them.  Luther\r\nand his progress were beginning to make a great noise in France.  After\r\nhis discussion with Dr. Eck at Leipzig in 1519 he had consented to take\r\nfor judges the Universities of Erfurt and Paris; on the 20th of January,\r\n1520, the quoestor of the nation of France bought twenty copies of\r\nLuther’s conference with Dr. Eck to distribute amongst the members of his\r\ncommittee; the University gave more than a year to its examination.  “All\r\nEurope,” says Crevier, “was waiting for the decision of the University of\r\nParis.”  Whenever an incident occurred or a question arose, “We shall\r\nsee,” said they of the Sorbonne, “what sort of folks hold to Luther.\r\nWhy, that fellow is worse than Luther!”  In April, 1521, the University\r\nsolemnly condemned Luther’s writings, ordering that they should be\r\npublicly burned, and that the author should be compelled to retract.  The\r\nSyndic of the Sorbonne, Noel Bedier, who, to give his name a classical\r\ntwang, was called _Beda,_ had been the principal and the most eager actor\r\nin this procedure; he was a theologian full of subtlety, obstinacy,\r\nharshness, and hatred.  “In a single Beda there are three thousand\r\nmonks,” Erasmus used to say of him.  The syndic had at court two powerful\r\npatrons, the king’s mother, Louise of Savoy, and the chancellor, Duprat,\r\nboth decided enemies of the Reformers.  Louise of Savoy, in consequence\r\nof her licentious morals and her thirst for riches; Duprat, by reason of\r\nthe same thirst, and of his ambition to become an equally great lord in\r\nthe church as in the state; and he succeeded, for in 1525 he was\r\nappointed Archbishop of Sens.  They were, moreover, both of them, opposed\r\nto any liberal reform, and devoted, in any case, to absolute power.\r\nBeaucaire de Peguilhem, a contemporary and most Catholic historian,--for\r\nhe accompanied the Cardinal of Lorraine to the Council of Trent,--calls\r\nDuprat “the most vicious of bipeds.”  Such patrons did not lack\r\nhot-headed executants of their policy; friendly relations had not ceased\r\nbetween the Reformers and their adversaries; a Jacobin monk, De Roma by\r\nname, was conversing one day at Meaux with Farel and his friends; the\r\nReformers expressed the hopes they had in the propagation of the gospel;\r\nDe Roma all at once stood up, shouting, “Then I and all the rest of the\r\nbrotherhood will preach a crusade we will stir up the people; and if the\r\nking permits the preaching of your gospel, we will have him expelled by\r\nhis own subjects from his own kingdom.”  Fanatical passions were already\r\nat work, though the parties were too unequal as yet to come to actual\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nAgainst such passions the Reformers found Francis I. a very indecisive\r\nand very inefficient protector.  “I wish,” said he, “to give men of\r\nletters special marks of my favor.”  When deputies from the Sorbonne came\r\nand requested him to put down the publication of learned works taxed with\r\nheresy, “I do not wish,” he replied, “to have those folks meddled with;\r\nto persecute those who instruct us would be to keep men of ability from\r\ncoming to our country.”  But in spite of his language, orders were given\r\nto the bishops to furnish the necessary funds for the prosecution of\r\nheretics, and, when the charge of heresy became frequent, Francis I. no\r\nlonger repudiated it.  “Those people,” he said, “do nothing but bring\r\ntrouble into the state.”  Troubles, indeed, in otherwise tranquil\r\nprovinces, where the Catholic faith was in great force, often accompanied\r\nthe expression of those wishes for reform to which the local clergy\r\nthemselves considered it necessary to make important concessions.  A\r\nserious fire took place at Troyes in 1524.  “It was put down,” says M.\r\nBoutiot, a learned and careful historian of that town, “to the account of\r\nthe new religious notions, as well as to that of the Emperor Charles V.’s\r\nfriends and the Constable de Bourbon’s partisans.  As early as 1520 there\r\nhad begun to be felt at Troyes the first symptoms of repressive measures\r\ndirected against the Reformation; in 1523, 1527, and 1528, provincial\r\ncouncils were held at Meaux, Lyons, Rouen, Bourges, and Paris, to oppose\r\nthe Lutherans.  These councils drew up regulations tending to reformation\r\nof morals and of religious ceremonies; they decided that the\r\nadministration of the sacraments should take place without any demand for\r\nmoney, and that preachers, in their sermons, should confine themselves to\r\nthe sacred books, and not quote poets or profane authors; they closed the\r\nchurches to profane assemblies and burlesques (fetes des fous); they\r\nordered the parish priests, in their addresses (au prone), to explain the\r\ngospel of the day; they ruled that a stop should be put to the abuses of\r\nexcommunication; they interdicted the publication of any book on\r\nreligious subjects without the permission of the bishop of the diocese.\r\n.  .  .  Troyes at that time contained some enlightened men; William Bude\r\n(Budaeus) was in uninterrupted communication with it; the Pithou family,\r\nrepresented by their head, Peter Pithou, a barrister at Troyes and a man\r\nhighly thought of, were in correspondence with the Reformers, especially\r\nwith Lefevre of Etaples.”  [_Histoire de la Ville de Troyes et de la\r\nChampagne meridionale,_ by T.  Boutiot, 1873, t. iii.  p. 379.]  And thus\r\nwas going on throughout almost the whole of France, partly in the path of\r\nliberty, partly in that of concessions, partly in that of hardships, the\r\nwork of the Reformation, too weak as yet and too disconnected to engage\r\nto any purpose in a struggle, but even now sufficiently wide-spread and\r\nstrong to render abortive any attempt to strangle it.\r\n\r\nThe defeat at Pavia and the captivity of Francis I. at Madrid placed the\r\ngoverning power for thirteen months in the hands of the most powerful\r\nfoes of the Reformation, the regent Louise of Savoy and the chancellor\r\nDuprat.  They used it unsparingly, with the harsh indifference of\r\npoliticians who will have, at any price, peace within their dominions and\r\nsubmission to authority.  It was under their regimen that there took\r\nplace the first martyrdom decreed and executed in France upon a partisan\r\nof the Reformation for an act of aggression and offence against the\r\nCatholic church.  John Leclerc, a wool-carder at Meaux, seeing a bull\r\nof indulgences affixed to the door of Meaux cathedral, had torn it down,\r\nand substituted for it a placard in which the pope was described as\r\nAntichrist.  Having been arrested on the spot, he was, by decree of the\r\nParliament of Paris, whipped publicly, three days consecutively, and\r\nbranded on the forehead by the hangman in the presence of his mother, who\r\ncried, “Jesus Christ forever!”  He was banished, and retired in July,\r\n1525, to Metz; and there he was working at his trade when he heard that a\r\nsolemn procession was to take place, next day, in the environs of the\r\ntown.  In his blind zeal he went and broke down the images at the feet of\r\nwhich the Catholics were to have burned incense.  Being arrested on his\r\nreturn to the town, he, far from disavowing the deed, acknowledged it and\r\ngloried in it.  He was sentenced to a horrible punishment; his right hand\r\nwas cut off, his nose was torn out, pincers were applied to his arms, his\r\nnipples were plucked out, his head was confined in two circlets of\r\nred-hot iron, and, whilst he was still chanting, in a loud voice, this\r\nversicle from the cxvth Psalm,--\r\n\r\n               “Their idols are silver and gold,\r\n               The work of men’s hands.”\r\n\r\nhis bleeding and mutilated body was thrown upon the blazing fagots.  He\r\nhad a younger brother, Peter Leclerc, a simple wool-carder like himself,\r\nwho remained at Meaux, devoted to the same faith and the same cause.\r\n“Great _clerc,_” says a contemporary chronicler, playing upon his name,\r\n“who knew no language but that which he had learned from his nurse, but\r\nwho, being thoroughly grounded in the holy writings, besides the\r\nintegrity of his life, was chosen by the weavers and became the first\r\nminister of the gospel seen in France.”  An old man of Meaux, named\r\nStephen Mangin, offered his house, situated near the market-place, for\r\nholding regular meetings.  Forty or fifty of the faithful formed the\r\nnucleus of the little church which grew up.  Peter Leclerc preached and\r\nadministered the sacraments in Stephen Mangin’s house so regularly that,\r\ntwenty years after his brother John’s martyrdom, the meetings, composed\r\npartly of believers who flocked in from the neighboring villages, were\r\nfrom three to four hundred in number.  One day when they had celebrated\r\nthe Lord’s Supper, the 8th of September, 1546, the house was surrounded,\r\nand nearly sixty persons, men, women, and children, who allowed\r\nthemselves to be arrested without making any resistance, were taken.\r\nThey were all sent before the Parliament of Paris; fourteen of the men\r\nwere sentenced to be burned alive in the great marketplace at Meaux, on\r\nthe spot nearest to the house in which the crime of heresy had been\r\ncommitted; and their wives, together with their nearest relatives, were\r\nsentenced to be present at the execution, “the men bare-headed and the\r\nwomen ranged beside them individually, in such sort that they might be\r\ndistinguished amongst the rest.”  The decree was strictly carried out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Burning of Reformers at Meaux----188]\r\n\r\nIt costs a pang to recur to these hideous exhibitions, but it must be\r\ndone; for history not only has a right, but is bound to do justice upon\r\nthe errors and crimes of the past, especially when the past had no idea\r\nof guilt in the commission of them.  A wit of the last century,\r\nChampfort, used to say, “There is nothing more dangerous than an honest\r\nman engaged in a rascally calling.”  There is nothing more dangerous than\r\nerrors and crimes of which the perpetrators do not see the absurd and\r\nodious character.  The contemporary historian, Sleidan, says, expressly,\r\n“The common people in France hold that there are no people more wicked\r\nand criminal that heretics; generally, as long as they are a prey to the\r\nblazing fagots, the people around them are excited to frenzy and curse\r\nthem in the midst of their torments.”  The sixteenth century is that\r\nperiod of French history at which this intellectual and moral blindness\r\ncost France “Their idols are silver and gold, The work of men’s hands,”--\r\nmost dear; it supplied the bad passions of men with a means, of which\r\nthey amply availed themselves, of gratifying then without scruple and\r\nwithout remorse. If, in the early part of this century, the Reformation\r\nwas as yet without great leaders, it was not, nevertheless, amongst only\r\nthe laborers, the humble and the poor, that it found confessors and\r\nmartyrs.  The provincial nobility, the burgesses of the towns, the\r\nmagistracy, the bar, the industrial classes as well as the learned, even\r\nthen furnished their quota of devoted and faithful friends.  A nobleman,\r\na Picard by birth, born about 1490 at Passy, near Paris, where he\r\ngenerally lived, Louis de Berquin by name, was one of the most\r\ndistinguished of them by his social position, his elevated ideas,\r\nhis learning, the purity of his morals, and the dignity of his life.\r\nPossessed of a patrimonial estate, near Abbeville, which brought him in a\r\nmodest income of six hundred crowns a year, and a bachelor, he devoted\r\nhimself to study and to religious matters with independence of mind and\r\nwith a pious heart.  “Most faithfully observant,” says Erasmus, “of the\r\nordinances and rites of the church, to wit, prescribed fasts, holy days,\r\nforbidden meats, masses, sermons, and, in a word, all, that tends to\r\npiety, he strongly reprobated the doctrines of Luther.”  He was none the\r\nless, in 1523, denounced to the Parliament of Paris as being on the side\r\nof the Reformers.  He had books, it was said; he even composed them\r\nhimself on questions of faith, and he had been engaged in some sort of\r\ndispute with the theologian William de Coutance, head of Harcourt\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Erasmus----194]\r\n\r\nThe attorney-general of the Parliament ordered one of his officers to go\r\nand make an examination of Berquin’s books as well as papers, and to\r\nseize what appeared to him to savor of heresy.  The officer brought away\r\ndivers works of Luther, Melancthon, and Carlostadt, and some original\r\ntreatises of Berquin himself, which were deposited in the keeping of the\r\ncourt.  The theological faculty claimed to examine them as being within\r\ntheir competence.  On being summoned by the attorney-general, Berquin\r\ndemanded to be present when an inventory was made of his books or\r\nmanuscripts, and to give such explanations as he should deem necessary;\r\nand his request was granted without question.  On the 26th of June, 1523,\r\nthe commissioners of the Sorbonne made their report.  On the 8th of July,\r\nPeter Lizet, king’s advocate, read it out to the court.  The matter came\r\non again for hearing on the 1st of August.  Berquin was summoned and\r\ninterrogated, and, as the result of this interrogatory, was arrested and\r\ncarried off to imprisonment at the Conciergerie in the square tower.  On\r\nthe 5th of August sentence was pronounced, and Louis de Berquin was\r\nremanded to appear before the Bishop of Paris, as being charged with\r\nheresy, “in which case,” says the Journal d’un Bourgeois de Paris, “he\r\nwould have been in great danger of being put to death according to law,\r\nas he had well deserved.”  The public were as ready as the accusers to\r\nbelieve in the crime and to impatiently await its punishment.\r\n\r\nIt was not without surprise or without displeasure that, on the 8th of\r\nAugust, just as they had “made over to the Bishop of Paris, present and\r\naccepting” the prisoner confined in the Conciergerie, the members of the\r\ncouncil-chamber observed the arrival of Captain Frederic, belonging to\r\nthe archers of the king’s guard, and bringing a letter from the king, who\r\nchanged the venue in Berquin’s case so as to decide it himself at his\r\ngrand council; in consequence of which the prisoner would have to be\r\nhanded over, not to the bishop, but to the king.  The chamber\r\nremonstrated; Berquin was no longer their prisoner; the matter had been\r\ndecided; it was the bishop to whom application must be made.  But these\r\nremonstrances had been foreseen; the captain had verbal instructions to\r\ncarry off Louis de Berquin by force in case of a refusal to give him up.\r\nThe chamber decided upon handing over the bishop’s prisoner to the king,\r\ncontenting themselves with causing the seized books and manuscripts to be\r\nburned that very day in the space in front of Notre Dame.  It was whilst\r\nrepairing to the scene of war in Italy, and when he was just entering\r\nMelun, where he merely passed through, that the king had given this\r\nunexpected order, on the very day, August 5, on which the Parliament\r\npronounced the decree which sent Berquin to appear before the Bishop of\r\nParis.  There is no clear trace of the vigilant protect, or who had so\r\nclosely watched the proceedings against Berquin, and so opportunely\r\nappealed for the king’s interference.  In any incident of this sort there\r\nis a temptation to presume that the influence was that of Princess\r\nMarguerite; but it is not certain that she was at this time anywhere near\r\nthe king; perhaps John du Bellay, Bishop of Bayonne, acted for her.\r\nFrancis I. was, moreover, disposed to extend protection, of his own\r\naccord, to gentlemen and scholars against furious theologians, when the\r\nlatter were not too formidable for him.  However that may be, Berquin, on\r\nbecoming the king’s prisoner, was summoned before the chancellor, Duprat,\r\nwho, politely reproaching him with having disquieted the church, confined\r\nhimself to requesting that he would testify some regret for it.  Berquin\r\nsubmitted with a good grace, and, being immediately set at liberty, left\r\nParis and repaired to his estate in Picardy.\r\n\r\nWhilst he there resumed his life of peaceful study, the Parliament\r\ncontinued to maintain in principle and openly proclaim its right of\r\nrepression against heretics.  On the 12th of August, 1523, it caused\r\nnotice to be given, by sound of trumpet, throughout the whole of Paris,\r\nthat clergy and laymen were to deposit in the keeping of the Palace all\r\nLuther’s books that they possessed.  Laymen who did not comply with this\r\norder would have their property confiscated; clergymen would be deprived\r\nof their temporalities and banished.  Toleration, in a case of suspected\r\nheresy, was an act of the king’s which itself required toleration;\r\nproceedings against heresy remained the law of the land, constantly\r\nhanging over every head.\r\n\r\nEighteen months later, in May, 1525, there seemed to be no further\r\nthought about Berquin; but the battle of Pavia was lost; Francis I. was a\r\nprisoner at Madrid; Louise of Savoy and the chancellor, Duprat, wielded\r\nthe power.  The question of heretics again came to the front.  “The queen\r\nmust be told,” said Peter Lizet, king’s advocate, “as St. Gregory told\r\nBrunehaut, Queen of the Franks, that the best way of driving away the\r\nenemies of the kingdom is to drive away from it the enemies of God and\r\nHis spouse, the Church.”  On the 10th of April, 1525, on occasion of\r\ngiving the regent some counsel as to her government, the Parliament\r\nstrongly recommended her to take proceedings against the heretics.  “The\r\ncourt,” they said to her, “has before now passed several provisional\r\ndecrees against the guilty, which have not been executed because of the\r\nevil disposition of the times and the hinderances effected by the\r\ndelinquents, who have found means of suspending and delaying the\r\njudgments given against them, as well by transference of the venue to the\r\ngrand council as by seizure and removal of certain of them, prisoners at\r\nthe time, whom they have had withdrawn from their prisons by exercise of\r\nsovereign and absolute power, which has given the rest occasion and\r\nboldness to follow the evil doctrine.”  It was impossible to reproach the\r\nking more broadly with having set Berquin at liberty.  The Parliament\r\nfurther advised the regent to ask the pope to send over to France\r\npontifical delegates invested with his own powers to watch and to try in\r\nhis name “even archbishops, bishops, and abbots, who by their deeds,\r\nwritings, or discourses, should render themselves suspected of a leaning\r\ntowards heresy.”  Louise of Savoy, without any appearance of being hurt\r\nby the attack made by the Parliament on the acts of the king her son,\r\neagerly followed the advice given her; and on the 20th of May, 1525,\r\nClement VII., in his turn, eagerly appointed four delegates commissioned\r\nto try all those suspected of heresy, who, in case of condemnation, were\r\nto be left to the secular arm.  On the very day on which the pope\r\nappointed his delegates, the faculty of theology at Paris passed censure\r\nupon divers writings of Erasmus, translated and spread abroad in France\r\nby Berquin; and on the 8th of January, 1526, the Bishop of Amiens\r\ndemanded of the Parliament authority “to order the body to be seized of\r\nLouis de Berquin, who resided in his diocese and was scandalizing it by\r\nhis behavior.”  The Parliament authorized his arrest; and, on the 24th of\r\nJanuary, Berquin was once more a prisoner in the Conciergerie, at the\r\nsame time that orders were given to seize all his books and papers,\r\nwhether at his own house or at that of his friend the Lord of Rambure at\r\nAbbeville.  The great trial of Berquin for heresy was recommenced, and in\r\nit the great name of Erasmus was compromised.\r\n\r\nWhen the question was thus solemnly reopened, Berquin’s defenders were\r\nmuch excited.  Defenders, we have said; but, in truth, history names but\r\none, the Princess Marguerite, who alone showed any activity, and alone\r\ndid anything to the purpose.  She wrote at once to the king, who was\r\nstill at Madrid “My desire to obey your commands was sufficiently strong\r\nwithout having it redoubled by the charity you have been pleased to show\r\nto poor Berquin according to your promise; I feel sure that He for whom I\r\nbelieve him to have suffered will approve of the mercy which, for His\r\nhonor, you have had upon His servant and yours.”  Francis I. had, in\r\nfact, written to suspend until his return the proceedings against\r\nBerquin, as well as those against Lefevre, Roussel, and all the other\r\ndoctors suspected of heresy.  The regent transmitted the king’s orders to\r\nthe pope’s delegates, who presented themselves on the 20th of February\r\nbefore the Parliament to ask its advice.  “The king is as badly advised\r\nas he himself is good,” said the dean of the faculty of theology.  The\r\nParliament answered that “for a simple letter missive” it could not\r\nadjourn; it must have a letter patent; and it went on with the trial.\r\nBerquin presented several demands for delay, evidently in order to wait\r\nfor the king’s return and personal intervention.  The court refused them;\r\nand, on the 5th of March, 1526, the judgment was read to him in his\r\nprison at the Conciergerie.  It was to the effect that his books should\r\nbe again burned before his eyes, that he should declare his approval of\r\nso just a sentence, and that he should earn the compassion of the church\r\nby not refusing her any satisfaction she might demand; else he should\r\nhimself go to the stake.\r\n\r\nWhilst Berquin’s trial was thus coming to an end, Francis I. was entering\r\nFrance once more in freedom, crying, “So I am king again!”  During the\r\nlatter days of March, amongst the numerous personages who came to\r\ncongratulate him was John de Selve, premier president of the Parliament\r\nof Paris.  The king gave him a very cold reception.  “My lords,” wrote\r\nthe premier president to his court, “I heard, through M. de Selve, my\r\nnephew, about some displeasure that was felt as regards our body, and I\r\nalso perceived it myself.  I have already begun to speak of it to Madame\r\n[the king’s mother].  I will do, as I am bound to, my duty towards the\r\ncourt, with God’s help.”  On the 1st of April the king, who intended to\r\nreturn by none but slow stages to Paris, wrote from Mont-de-Marsan, to\r\nthe judges holding his court of Parliament at Paris:--\r\n\r\n“We have presently been notified how that, notwithstanding that, through\r\nour dear and much-loved lady and mother, regent in France during our\r\nabsence, it was written unto you and ordered that you would be pleased\r\nnot to proceed in any way whatever with the matter of Sieur Berquin,\r\nlately detained a prisoner, until we should have been enabled to return\r\nto this our kingdom, you have, nevertheless, at the request and pursuance\r\nof his ill-wishers, so far proceeded with his business that you have come\r\nto a definitive judgment on it.  Whereat we cannot be too much astounded.\r\n.  .  .  For this cause we do will and command and enjoin upon you .  .\r\nthat you are not to proceed to execution of the said judgment, which, as\r\nthe report is, you have pronounced against the said Berquin, but shall\r\nput him, himself and the depositions and the proceedings in his said\r\ntrial, in such safe keeping that you may be able to answer to us for\r\nthem.  .  .  .  And take care that you make no default therein, for we do\r\nwarn you that, if default there be, we shall look to such of you as shall\r\nseem good to us to answer to us for it.”\r\n\r\nHere was not only a letter patent, but a letter minatory.  As to the\r\nexecution of their judgment, the Parliament obeyed the king’s injunction,\r\nmaintaining, however, the principle as well as the legality of Berquin’s\r\nsentence, and declaring that they awaited the king’s orders to execute\r\nit.  “According to the teaching of the two Testaments,” they said, “God\r\never rageth, in His just wrath, against the nations who fail to enforce\r\nrespect for the laws prescribed by Himself.  It is important, moreover,\r\nto hasten the event in order as soon as possible to satisfy,\r\nindependently of God, the people who murmur and whose impatience is\r\nbecoming verily troublesome.”  Francis I. did not reply.  He would not\r\nhave dared, even in thought, to attack the question of principle as to\r\nthe chastisement of heresy, and he was afraid of weakening his own\r\nAuthority too much if he humiliated his Parliament too much; it was\r\nsufficient for him that he might consider Berquin’s life to be safe.\r\nKings are protectors who are easily satisfied when their protection, to\r\nbe worth anything, might entail upon them the necessity of an energetic\r\nstruggle and of self-compromise.  “Trust not in princes nor their\r\nchildren,” said Lord Strafford, after the Psalmist [_Nolite confidere\r\nprincipibus et filiis eorum, quia non est sales in illis,_ Ps. cxlvi.],\r\nwhen, in the seventeenth century, he found that Charles I. was abandoning\r\nhim to the English Parliament and the executioner.  Louis de Berquin\r\nmight have felt similar distrust as to Francis I., but his nature was\r\nconfident and hopeful; when he knew of the king’s letter to the\r\nParliament, he considered himself safe, and he testified as much to\r\nErasmus in a long letter, in which he told him the story of his trial,\r\nand alluded to “the fresh outbreak of anger on the part of those hornets\r\nwho accuse me of heresy,” said he, “simply because I have translated into\r\nthe vulgar tongue some of your little works, wherein they pretend that\r\nthey have discovered the most monstrous pieces of impiety.”  He\r\ntransmitted to Erasmus a list of the paragraphs which the pope’s\r\ndelegates had condemned, pressing him to reply, “as you well know how.\r\nThe king esteems you much, and will esteem you still more when\r\nyou have heaped confusion on this brood of benighted theologians whose\r\nineptitude is no excuse for their violence.”  By a strange coincidence,\r\nBerquin’s most determined foe, Noel Beda, provost of the Sorbonne, sent\r\nat the same time to Erasmus a copy of more than two hundred propositions\r\nwhich had been extracted from his works, and against which he, Beda, also\r\ncame forward as accuser.  Erasmus was a prudent man, and did not seek\r\nstrife; but when he was personally and offensively attacked by enemies\r\nagainst whom he was conscious of his strength, he exhibited it proudly\r\nand ably; and he replied to Beda by denouncing him, on the 6th of June,\r\nto the Parliament of Paris itself, as an impudent and ignorant\r\ncalumniator.  His letter, read at the session of Parliament on the 5th of\r\nJuly, 1526, was there listened to with profound deference, and produced a\r\nsensation which did not remain without effect; in vain did Beda persist\r\nin accusing Erasmus of heresy and in maintaining that he was of the\r\nbrotherhood of Luther; Parliament considered him in the wrong,\r\nprovisionally prohibited the booksellers from vending his libels against\r\nErasmus, and required previous authorization to be obtained for all books\r\ndestined for the press by the rectors of the Sorbonne.\r\n\r\nThe success of Erasmus was also a success for Berquin; but he was still\r\nin prison, ill and maltreated.  The king wrote on the 11th of July to\r\nParliament to demand that he should enjoy at least all the liberties that\r\nthe prison would admit of, that he should no longer be detained in an\r\nunhealthy cell, and that he should be placed in that building of the\r\nConciergerie where the court-yard was.  “That,” was the answer, “would be\r\na bad precedent; they never put in the court-yard convicts who had\r\nincurred the penalty of death.”  An offer was made to Berquin of the\r\nchamber reserved for the greatest personages, for princes of the blood,\r\nand of permission to walk in the court-yard for two hours a day, one in\r\nthe morning and the other in the evening, in the absence of the other\r\nprisoners.  Neither the king nor Berquin was inclined to be content with\r\nthese concessions.  The king in his irritation sent from Beaugency, on\r\nthe 5th of October, two archers of his guard with a letter to this\r\neffect: “It is marvellously strange that what we ordered has not yet been\r\ndone.  We do command and most expressly enjoin upon you, this once for\r\nall, that you are incontinently to put and deliver the said Berquin into\r\nthe hands of the said Texier and Charles do Broc, whom we have ordered to\r\nconduct him to our castle of the Louvre.”  The court still objected; a\r\nprisoner favored by so high a personage, it was said, would soon be out\r\nof such a prison.  The objection resulted in a formal refusal to obey.\r\nThe provost of Paris, John de la Barre, the king’s premier gentleman, was\r\nrequested to repair to the palace and pay Berquin a visit, to ascertain\r\nfrom himself what could be done for him.  Berquin, for all that appears,\r\nasked for nothing but liberty to read and write.  “It is not possible,”\r\n was the reply; “such liberty is never granted to those who are condemned\r\nto death.”  As a great favor, Berquin was offered a copy of the Letters\r\nof St. Jerome and some volumes of history; and the provost had orders not\r\nto omit that fact in his report: “The king must be fully assured that the\r\ncourt do all they can to please him.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Berquin released by John de la Barre----198]\r\n\r\nBut it was to no purpose.  On the 19th of November, 1526, the provost of\r\nParis returned to the palace with a letter from the king, formally\r\ncommanding him to remove Berquin and transfer him to the Louvre.  The\r\ncourt again protested that they would not deliver over the said Berquin\r\nto the said provost; but, they said, “seeing what the times are, the said\r\nprovost will be able to find free access to the Conciergerie, for to do\r\nthere what he hath a mind to.”  The same day, about six in the evening,\r\nJohn de la Barre repaired to the Conciergerie, and removed from it Louis\r\nde Berquin, whom he handed over to the captain of the guard and four\r\narchers, who took him away to the Louvre.  Two months afterwards, in\r\nJanuary, 1527, Princess Marguerite married Henry d’Albret, King of\r\nNavarre, and about the same time, though it is difficult to discover the\r\nexact day, Louis de Berquin issued forth a free man from the Louvre, and\r\nthe new queen, on taking him at once into her service, wrote to the\r\nConstable Anne de Montmorency, whom the king had charged with the duty of\r\ngetting Berquin set at liberty, “I thank you for the pleasure you have\r\ndone me in the matter of poor Berquin, whom I esteem as much as if he\r\nwere myself; and so you may say that you have delivered me from prison,\r\nsince I consider in that light the pleasure done to me.”\r\n\r\nMarguerite’s sympathetic joy was as natural as touching; she must have\r\nthought Berquin safe; he was free and in the service of one who was\r\nfundamentally a sovereign-prince, though living in France and in\r\ndependence upon the King of France, whose sister he had just married.\r\nIn France, Berquin was under the stigma of having been condemned to death\r\nas a heretic, and was confronted by determined enemies.  In so perilous a\r\nposition his safety depended upon his courting oblivion.  But instead of\r\nthat, and consulting only the dictates of his generous and blind\r\nconfidence in the goodness of his cause, he resolved to assume the\r\noffensive and to cry for justice against his enemies.  “Beneath the cloak\r\nof religion,” he wrote to Erasmus, “the priests conceal the vilest\r\npassions, the most corrupt morals, and the most scandalous infidelity.\r\nIt is necessary to rend the veil which covers them, and boldly bring an\r\naccusation of impiety against the Sorbonne, Rome, and all their\r\nflunkies.”  Erasmus, justly alarmed, used all his influence to deter him:\r\nbut “the more confidence he showed,” says he, “the more I feared for him.\r\nI wrote to him frequently, begging him to get quit of the case by some\r\nexpedient, or even to withdraw himself on the pretext of a royal\r\nambassadorship obtained by the influence of his friends.  I told him that\r\nthe theologians would probably, as time went on, let his affair drop, but\r\nthat they would never admit themselves to be guilty of impiety.  I told\r\nhim to always bear in mind what a hydra was that Beda, and at how many\r\nmouths he belched forth venom. I told him to reflect well that he was\r\nabout to commit himself with a foe that was immortal, for a faculty never\r\ndies, and to rest assured that after having brought three monks to bay,\r\nhe would have to defend himself against numerous legions, not only\r\nopulent and powerful, but, besides, very dishonest and very experienced\r\nin the practice of every kind of cheatery, who would never rest until\r\nthey had effected his ruin, were his cause as just as Christ’s.  I told\r\nhim not to trust too much to the king’s protection, the favor of princes\r\nbeing unstable and their affections easily alienated by the artifices of\r\ninformers.  .  .  .  And if all this could not move him, I told him not\r\nto involve me in his business, for, with his permission, I was not at all\r\ninclined to get into any tangle with legions of monks and a whole faculty\r\nof theology.  But I did not succeed in convincing him; whilst I argued in\r\nso many ways to deter him from his design, I did nothing but excite his\r\ncourage.”\r\n\r\nNot only did Berquin turn a deaf ear to the wise counsels of Erasmus, but\r\nhis protectress, Marguerite, being moved by his courage, and herself also\r\nas imprudent as she was generous, persuaded herself that he was in the\r\nright, and supported him in his undertaking.  She wrote to the king her\r\nbrother, “Poor Berquin, who, through your goodness, holds that God has\r\ntwice preserved his life, throws himself upon you, having no longer any\r\none to whom he can have recourse, for to give you to understand his\r\ninnocence; and whereas, Monseigneur, I know the esteem in which you hold\r\nhim and the desire he hath always had to do you service, I do not fear to\r\nentreat you, by letter instead of speech, to be pleased to have pity on\r\nhim.  And if it please you to show signs of taking his matter to heart, I\r\nhope that the truth, which he will make to appear, will convict the\r\nforgers of heretics of being slanderers and disobedient towards you\r\nrather than zealots for the faith.”\r\n\r\nIn his complaisance and indifference Francis I. attended to his sister’s\r\nwishes, and appeared to support Berquin in his appeal for a fresh and\r\ndefinite investigation of his case.  On the other hand, Parliament, to\r\nwhom the matter was referred, showed a disposition to take into account\r\nthe king’s good will towards Berquin, lately convicted, but now become in\r\nhis turn plaintiff and accuser.  “We have no wish to dispute your power,”\r\n said the president, Charles de Guillard, to the king at a bed of justice\r\nheld on the 24th of July, 1527: “it would be a species of sacrilege, and\r\nwe know well that you are above the laws, and that neither laws nor\r\nordinances can constrain you.  Your most humble and most obedient court\r\nis comforted and rejoiced at your presence and advent, just as the\r\napostles were when they saw their God after the resurrection.  We are\r\nassured that your will is to be the peculiar protector and defender of\r\nreligion, and not to permit or suffer in your kingdom any errors,\r\nheresies, or false doctrines.”\r\n\r\nThe matter thus reopened pursued its course slowly; twelve judges were\r\nappointed to give a definite decision; and the king himself nominated\r\nsix, amongst whom he placed Berquin’s friend, William Bude.  Various\r\nincidents unconnected with religious disputes supervened.  The Queen of\r\nNavarre was brought to bed at Pau, on the 7th of January, 1528, of a\r\ndaughter, Jeanne d’Albret, the future mother of Henry IV.  The marriage\r\nof Princess Renee of France, daughter of Louis XII., with Duke Hercules\r\nof Ferrara, was concluded, and the preparations for its celebration were\r\ngoing on at Fontainebleau, when, on Monday, June 1, 1528, the day after\r\nthe Feast of Pentecost, “some heretics came by night,” says the Journal\r\nd’un Bourgeois de Paris, “to an image of Notre-Dame de Pierre, which is\r\nat a corner of the street behind the church of Petit St. Antoine; to the\r\nwhich image they gave several blows with their weapons, and cut off her\r\nhead and that of her little child, Our Lord.  But it was never known who\r\nthe image-breakers were.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Heretic Iconoclasts----201]\r\n\r\nThe king, being then at Paris, and being advertised thereof, was so wroth\r\nand upset that, it is said, he wept right sore.  And, incontinently,\r\nduring the two days following, he caused it to be proclaimed by sound of\r\ntrumpet throughout the cross-roads of the city that if any persons knew\r\nwho had done it they should make their report and statement to justice\r\nand to him, and he would give them a thousand crowns of gold.\r\nNevertheless nothing could be known about it, although the king showed\r\ngreat diligence in the matter, and had officers commissioned to go from\r\nhouse to house to make inquiry.  .  .  .  On Tuesday and other days\r\nfollowing there were special processions from the parish churches and\r\nother churches of the city, which nearly all of them went to the said\r\nplace.  .  .  .  And on the day of the Fete-Dieu, which was the 11th day\r\nof the said month of June, the king went in procession, most devoutly,\r\nwith the parish of St. Paul and all the clergy, to the spot where was the\r\nsaid image.  He himself carried a lighted waxen taper, bareheaded, with\r\nvery great reverence, having with him the band and hautbois with several\r\nclarions and trumpets, which made a glorious show, so melodiously did\r\nthey play.  And with him were the Cardinal of Lorraine, and several\r\nprelates and great lords, and all the gentlemen, having each a taper of\r\nwhite wax in their hands, and all his archers had each a waxen taper\r\nalight, and thus they went to the spot where was the said image, with\r\nvery great honor and reverence, which was a beautiful sight to see, and\r\nwith devotion.”  [_Journal d’un Bourgeois de Paris,_ pp. 347-351.]\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century men were far from understanding that respect is\r\ndue to every religious creed sincerely professed and practised; the\r\ninnovators, who broke the images of the Virgin Mary and the Infant Jesus,\r\ndid not consider that by thus brutally attacking that which they regarded\r\nas a superstition, they were committing a revolting outrage upon\r\nChristian consciences.  Such an incident was too favorable for Berquin’s\r\nenemies not to be eagerly turned to profit by them.  Although his\r\nprosecution had been resumed, he had hitherto remained at large, and been\r\ntreated respectfully; he repaired without any guard over him from the\r\nLouvre to the Palace of Justice.  But now he was arrested, and once more\r\nconfined in the tower of the Conciergerie.  Some books of his, seized\r\nhap-hazard and sent to the syndic Beda, were found covered with notes,\r\nwhich were immediately pronounced to be heretical.  On the 16th of April,\r\n1529, he was brought before the court.  “Louis Berquin,” said the\r\npresident to him, “you are convicted of having belonged to the sect of\r\nLuther, and of having made wicked books against the majesty of God and of\r\nHis glorious Mother.  In consequence, we do sentence you to make\r\nhonorable amends, bareheaded and with a waxen taper alight in your hand,\r\nin the great court of the palace, crying for mercy to God, the king, and\r\nthe law, for the offence by you committed.  After that, you will be\r\nconducted bareheaded and on foot to the Place de Greve, where your books\r\nwill be burned before your eyes.  Then you will be taken in front of the\r\nchurch of Notre-Dame, where you will make honorable amends to God and to\r\nthe glorious Virgin His Mother.  After which a hole will be pierced in\r\nyour tongue, that member wherewith you have sinned.  Lastly, you will be\r\nplaced in the prison of Monsieur de Paris (the bishop), and will be there\r\nconfined between two stone walls for the whole of your life.  And we\r\nforbid that there be ever given you book to read or pen and ink to\r\nwrite.”  This sentence, which Erasmus called atrocious, appeared to take\r\nBerquin by surprise; for a moment he remained speechless, and then he\r\nsaid, “I appeal to the king:” whereupon he was taken back to prison.  The\r\nsentence was to be carried out the same day about three P. M. A great\r\ncrowd of more than twenty thousand persons, says a contemporary\r\nchronicler, rushed to the bridges, the streets, the squares, where this\r\nsolemn expiation was to take place.  The commissioner of police, the\r\nofficer of the Chatelet, the archers, crossbowmen, and arquebusiers of\r\nthe city had repaired to the palace to form the escort; but when they\r\npresented themselves at the prison to take Berquin, he told them that he\r\nhad appealed to the king, and that he would not go with them.  The escort\r\nand the crowd retired disappointed.  The president convoked the tribunal\r\nthe same evening, and repairing to the prison, he made Berquin sign the\r\nform of his appeal.  William Bude hurried to the scene, and vehemently\r\nurged the prisoner to give it up.  “A second sentence,” said he, “is\r\nready, and it pronounces death.  If you acquiesce in the first, we shall\r\nbe able to save you later on.  All that is demanded of you is to ask\r\npardon: and have we not all need of pardon?” It appears that for a moment\r\nBerquin hesitated, and was on the point of consenting; but Bude remained\r\nanxious.  “I know him,” said he; “his ingenuousness and his confidence in\r\nthe goodness of his cause will ruin him.”  The king was at Blois, and his\r\nsister Marguerite at St. Germain; on the news of this urgent peril she\r\nwrote to her brother, “I for the last time, make you a very humble\r\nrequest; it is, that you will be pleased to have pity upon poor Berquin,\r\nwhom I know to be suffering for nothing but loving the word of God and\r\nobeying yours.  You will be pleased, Monseigneur, so to act that it be\r\nnot said that separation has made you forget your most humble and most\r\nobedient subject and sister, Marguerite.”  We can discover no trace of\r\nany reply whatever from Francis I.  According to most of the documentary\r\nevidence, uncertainty lasted for three days.  Berquin persisted in his\r\nresolution.  “No,” he to his friend Bude, who again came to the prison,\r\n“I would rather endure death than give my approval, even by silence only\r\nto condemnation of the truth.”  The president of the court went once more\r\nto pay him a visit, and asked him if he held to his appeal.  Berquin\r\nsaid, “Yes.” court revised its original sentence, and for the penalty of\r\nperpetual imprisonment substituted that of the stake. On the 22d of\r\nApril, 1529, according to most of the documents, but on the 17th,\r\naccording to the _Journal d’un Bourgeois de Paris,_ which the details of\r\nthe last days render highly improbable, the officers of Parliament\r\nentered Berquin’s gloomy chamber.  He rose quietly and went with them;\r\nthe procession set out, and at about three arrived at the Place de Greve;\r\nwhere the stake was ready.  “Berquin had a gown of velvet, garments of\r\nsatin and damask, and hosen of gold thread,” says the Bourgeois de Paris.\r\n“‘Alas!’ said some as they saw him pass, ‘he is of noble lineage, a\r\nmighty great scholar, expert in science and subtile withal, and\r\nnevertheless he hath gone out of his senses.’”  We borrow the account of\r\nhis actual death from a letter of Erasmus, written on the evidence of an\r\neye-witness: “Not a symptom of agitation appeared either in his face or\r\nthe attitude of his body: he had the bearing of a man who is meditating\r\nin his cabinet on the subject of his studies, or in a temple on the\r\naffairs of heaven.  Even when the executioner, in a rough voice,\r\nproclaimed his crime and its penalty, the constant serenity of his\r\nfeatures was not at all altered.  When the order was given him to\r\ndismount from the tumbrel, he obeyed cheerfully without hesitating;\r\nnevertheless he had not about him any of that audacity, that arrogance,\r\nwhich in the case of malefactors is sometimes bred of their natural\r\nsavagery; everything about him bore evidence to the tranquillity of a\r\ngood conscience.  Before he died he made a speech to the people; but\r\nnone could hear him, so great was the noise which the soldiers made,\r\naccording, it is said, to the orders they had received.  When the cord\r\nwhich bound him to the post suffocated his voice, not a soul in the crowd\r\nejaculated the name of Jesus, whom it is customary to invoke even in\r\nfavor of parricides and the sacrilegious, to such extent was the\r\nmultitude excited against him by those folks who are to be found\r\neverywhere, and who can do anything with the feelings of the simple and\r\nignorant.”  Theodore de Beze adds that the grand penitentiary of Paris,\r\nMerlin, who was present at the execution, said, as he withdrew from the\r\nstill smoking stake, “I never saw any one die more Christianly.”  The\r\nimpressions and expressions of the crowd, as they dispersed, were very\r\ndiverse; but the majority cried, “He was a heretic.”  Others said, “God\r\nis the only just Judge, and happy is the man whom He absolves.”  Some\r\nsaid below their breath, “It is only through the cross that Christ will\r\ntriumph in the kingdom of the Gauls.”  A man went up to the Franciscan\r\nmonk who had placed himself at Berquin’s side in the procession, and had\r\nentreated him without getting from him anything but silence, and asked\r\nhim, “Did Berquin say that he had erred?”  “Yes, certainly,” answered the\r\nmonk, “and I doubt not but that his soul hath departed in peace.”  This\r\nexpression was reported to Erasmus; but “I don’t believe it,” said he;\r\n“it is the story that these fellows are obliged to invent after their\r\nvictim’s death, to appease the wrath of the people.”\r\n\r\nWe have dwelt in detail upon these two martyrs, Leclerc and Berquin, the\r\nwool-carder and the scholarly gentleman, because they are faithful and\r\nvivid representatives of the two classes amongst which, in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, the Reformation took root in France.  It had a double origin,\r\nmorally and socially, one amongst the people and the other amongst the\r\naristocratic and the learned; it was not national, nor was it embraced by\r\nthe government of the country.  Persecution was its first and its only\r\ndestiny in the reign of Francis I., and it went through the ordeal with\r\nadmirable courage and patience; it resisted only in the form of\r\nmartyrdom.  We will give no more of such painful and hideous pictures; in\r\nconnection with this subject, and as regards the latter portion of this\r\nreign, we will dwell upon only those general facts which bear the impress\r\nof public morals and the conduct of the government rather than of the\r\nfortunes and the feelings of individuals.  It was after Francis I.’s time\r\nthat the Reformation, instead of confining itself to submitting with\r\ndignity to persecution, made a spirited effort to escape from it by\r\nbecoming a political party, and taking up, in France, the task of the\r\nopposition--a liberal and an energetic opposition, which claims its\r\nrights and its securities.  It then took its place in French history as a\r\ngreat public power, organized and commanded by great leaders, and no\r\nlonger as a multitude of scattered victims falling one after another,\r\nwithout a struggle, beneath the blows of their persecutors.\r\n\r\nThe martyrdom of Berquin put a stop to the attempt at quasi-tolerance in\r\nfavor of aristocratic and learned Reformers which Francis I. had essayed\r\nto practise; after having twice saved Berquin from a heretic’s doom, he\r\nfailed to save him ultimately; and, except the horrible details of\r\nbarbarity in the execution, the scholarly gentleman received the same\r\nmeasure as the wool-carder, after having been, like him, true to his\r\nfaith and to his dignity as a man and a Christian.  Persecution\r\nthenceforward followed its course without the king putting himself to the\r\ntrouble of applying the drag for anybody; his sister Marguerite alone\r\ncontinued to protect, timidly and dejectedly, those of her friends\r\namongst the reformers whom she could help or to whom she could offer an\r\nasylum in Bearn without embroiling herself with the king, her brother,\r\nand with the Parliaments.  We will not attempt to enumerate the\r\nmartyrdoms which had to be undergone by the persevering Reformers in\r\nFrance between 1529 and 1547, from the death of Louis de Berquin to that\r\nof Francis I.; the task would be too long and intermingled with too many\r\npetty questions of dates or proper names; we will confine ourselves to\r\nquoting some local computations and to conning over the great historic\r\nfacts which show to what extent the persecution was general and\r\nunrelenting, though it was ineffectual, in the end, to stifle the\r\nReformation and to prevent the bursting out of those religious wars\r\nwhich, from the death of Francis I. to the accession of Henry IV.,\r\nsmothered France in disaster, blood, and crime.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Francis I., from 1524 to 1547, eighty-one death-sentences\r\nfor heresy were executed.  At Paris only, from the 10th of November to\r\nthe 2d of May, a space of some six months, one hundred and two sentences\r\nto death by fire for heresy were pronounced; twenty-seven were executed;\r\ntwo did not take place, because those who ought to have undergone them\r\ndenounced other Reformers to save themselves; and seventy-three succeeded\r\nin escaping by flight.  The _Journal d’un Bourgeois de Paris_ (pp. 444-\r\n450) does not mention sentences to lesser penalties.  In a provincial\r\ntown, whose history one of its most distinguished inhabitants, M.\r\nBoutiot, has lately written from authentic documents and local\r\ntraditions, at Troyes in fact, in 1542 and 1546, two burgesses, one a\r\nclerk and the other a publisher, were sentenced to the stake and executed\r\nfor the crime of heresy: “on an appeal being made by the publisher, Mace\r\nMoreau, the Parliament of Paris confirmed the sentence  pronounced by the\r\nbailiff’s court,” and he underwent his punishment on the Place St. Pierre\r\nwith the greatest courage.  The  decree of the Parliament contains the\r\nmost rigorous enactments against books in the French language treating of\r\nreligious  matters; and it enjoins upon all citizens the duty of\r\ndenouncing those who, publicly or not, make profession of the new\r\ndoctrine. “The Lutheran propaganda,” say the documents, “is in great\r\nforce throughout the diocese; it exercises influence not only on the\r\nclass of artisans, but also amongst the burgesses.  Doubt has made its\r\nway into many honest souls.  The Reformation has reached so far even\r\nwhere the schism is not complete.  Catholic priests profess some of the\r\nnew doctrines, at the same time that they remain attached to their\r\noffices.  Many bishops declare themselves partisans of the reformist\r\ndoctrines.  The Protestant worship, however, is not yet openly conducted.\r\nThe mass of the clergy do not like to abandon the past; they cling to\r\ntheir old traditions, and, if they have renounced certain abuses, they\r\nyield only on a few points of little importance.  The new ideas are\r\nspreading, even in the country.  .  .  .  Statues representing the Virgin\r\nand the saints are often broken, and these deeds are imputed to those who\r\nhave adopted the doctrines of Luther and of Calvin.  A Notre-Dame de\r\nPitie, situated at the Hotel-Dieule-Comte, was found with its head\r\nbroken.  This event excites to madness the Catholic population.  The\r\npersecutions continue.”  Many people emigrated for fear of the stake.\r\n“From August, 1552, to the 6th of January, 1555,” says the chronicler,\r\n“Troyes loses in consequence of exile, probably voluntary, a certain\r\nnumber of its best inhabitants,” and he names thirteen families with the\r\nstyle and title of “nobleman.”  He adds, “There is scarcely a month in\r\nthe year when there are not burned two or three heretics at Paris, Meaux,\r\nand Troyes, and sometimes more than a dozen.”  Troyes contained, at that\r\ntime, says M. Boutiot, eighteen thousand two hundred and eighty-five\r\ninhabitants, counting five persons to a household.  [Histoire de la Ville\r\nde Troyes, t. iii.  pp. 381, 387, 398, 415, 431.] Many other provincial\r\ntowns offered the same spectacle.\r\n\r\nDuring the long truce which succeeded the peace of Cambrai, from 1532 to\r\n1536, it might have been thought for a while that the persecution in\r\nFrance was going to be somewhat abated.  Policy obliged Francis I. to\r\nseek the support of the Protestants of Germany against Charles V.; he was\r\nincessantly fluctuating between that policy and a strictly Catholic and\r\npapal policy; by marrying his son Henry, on the 28th of October, 1533,\r\nto Catherine de’ Medici, niece of Pope Clement VII., he seemed to have\r\ndecided upon the latter course; but he had afterwards made a movement in\r\nthe contrary direction; Clement VII. had died on the 26th of September,\r\n1524; Paul III. had succeeded him; and Francis I. again turned towards\r\nthe Protestants of Germany; he entered into relations with the most\r\nmoderate amongst their theologians, with Melancthon, Bucer, and Sturm;\r\nthere was some talk of conciliation, of a re-establishment of peace and\r\nharmony in the church; nor did the king confine himself to speaking by\r\nthe mouth of diplomatists; he himself wrote to Melancthon, on the 23d of\r\nJune, 1535, “It is some time now since I heard from William du Bellay, my\r\nchamberlain and councillor, of the zeal with which you are exerting\r\nyourself to appease the altercations to which Christian doctrine has\r\ngiven rise.  I now hear that you are very much disposed to come to us for\r\nto confer with some of our most distinguished doctors as to the means of\r\nre-establishing in the church that sublime harmony which is the chief of\r\nall my desires.  Come, then, either in an official capacity or in your\r\nown private character; you will be most welcome to me, and you shall in\r\neither case have proof of the interest I feel in the glory of your own\r\nGermany and in the peace of the world.”  Melancthon had, indeed, shown an\r\ninclination to repair to Paris; he had written, on the 9th of May, 1535,\r\nto his friend Sturm, “I will not let myself be stopped by domestic ties\r\nor by fear of danger.  There is no human greatness before which I do not\r\nprefer Christ’s glory.  One thought alone gives me pause: I doubt my\r\nability to do any good; I fear it is impossible to obtain from the king\r\nthat which I regard as necessary for the Lord’s glory and for the peace\r\nof France.  You know that kingdom.  Pronounce your judgment.  If you\r\nthink that I shall do well to undertake the journey, I am off.”\r\n\r\nMelancthon had good reason to doubt whether success, such as he deemed\r\nnecessary, were possible.  Whilst Francis I. was making all these\r\nadvances to the Protestants of Germany, he was continuing to proceed\r\nagainst their brother Christians in France more bitterly and more\r\nflagrantly than ever.  Two recent events had very much envenomed party\r\nfeeling between the French Catholics and Reformers, and the king had been\r\nvery much compromised in this fresh crisis of the struggle.  In 1534 the\r\nlawless insurrection of Anabaptists and peasants, which had so violently\r\nagitated Germany in 1525, began again; the insurgents seized the town of\r\nMunster, in Westphalia, and there renewed their attempt to found the\r\nkingdom of Israel, with community of property and polygamy.  As in 1525,\r\nthey were promptly crushed by the German princes, Catholic and\r\nProtestant, of the neighborhood; but their rising had created some\r\nreverberation in France, and the Reformers had been suspected of an\r\ninclination to take part in it.  “It is said,” wrote the Chancellor de\r\nGranvelle, in January, 1535, to the ambassador of France at the court of\r\nCharles V., “that the number of the strayed from the faith in France, and\r\nthe danger of utter confusion, are very great; the enterprise of the said\r\nstrayed, about which you write to me, to set fire to the churches and\r\npillage the Louvre, proves that they were in great force.  Please God the\r\nking may be able to apply a remedy!” [_Papiers d’Etat du Cardinal de\r\nGranvelle,_ t. ii.  p. 283.] The accusation was devoid of all foundation;\r\nbut nothing is absurd in the eyes of party hatred and suspicion, and an\r\nincident, almost contemporaneous with the fresh insurrection of the\r\nAnabaptists, occurred to increase the king’s wrath, as well as the\r\npeople’s, against the Reformers, and to rekindle the flames of\r\npersecution.  On the 24th of October, 1534, placards against the mass,\r\ntransubstantiation, and the regimen as well as the faith of the Catholic\r\nchurch, were posted up during the night in the thoroughfares of Paris,\r\nand at Blois on the very chamberdoor of Francis I., whose first glance,\r\nwhen he got up in the morning, they caught.  They had been printed at\r\nNeufchatel, in Switzerland, where the influence of the refugee William\r\nFarel was strong, and their coarse violence of expression could not fail\r\nto excite the indignation of even the most indifferent Catholics.  In\r\ntheir fanatical blindness factions say only what satisfies their own\r\npassions, without considering moral propriety or the effect which will be\r\nproduced by their words upon the feelings of their adversaries, who also\r\nhave creeds and passions.  Francis I., equally shocked and irritated,\r\ndetermined to give the Catholic faith striking satisfaction, and\r\nProtestant audacity a bloody lesson.  On the 21st of January, 1535, a\r\nsolemn procession issued from the church of St.  Germain l’Auxerrois.\r\nJohn du Bellay, Bishop of Paris, held in his hands the holy sacrament,\r\nsurrounded by the three sons of France and the Duke de Vendome, who were\r\nthe dais-bearers; and the king walked behind, with a taper in his hand,\r\nbetween the Cardinals of Bourbon and Lorraine.  At each halting-place he\r\nhanded his taper to the Cardinal of Lorraine, folded his hands, and\r\nhumbly prostrating himself, implored divine mercy for his people.  After\r\nthe procession was over, the king, who had remained to dine with John du\r\nBellay, assembled in the great hall of the palace the heads of all the\r\ncompanies, and taking his place on a sort of throne which had been\r\nprepared for him, said, “Whatever progress may have already been made by\r\nthe pest, the remedy is still easy if each of you, devoured by the same\r\nzeal as I, will forget the claims of flesh and blood to remember only\r\nthat he is a Christian, and will denounce without pity all those whom he\r\nknows to be partisans or favorers of heresy. As for me, if my arm were\r\ngangrened, I would have it cut off though it were my right arm, and if my\r\nsons who hear me were such wretches as to fall into such execrable and\r\naccursed opinions, I would be willing to give them up to make a sacrifice\r\nof them to God.”  On the 29th of January there was published an edict\r\nwhich sentenced concealers of heretics, “Lutheran or other,” to the same\r\npenalties as the said heretics, unless they denounced their guests to\r\njustice; and a quarter of the property to be confiscated was secured to\r\nthe denouncers.  Fifteen days previously Francis I. had signed a decree\r\nstill stranger for a king who was a protector of letters; he ordered the\r\nabolition of printing, that means of propagating heresies, and “forbade\r\nthe printing of any book on pain of the halter.”  Six weeks later,\r\nhowever, on the 26th of February, he became ashamed of such an act, and\r\nsuspended its execution indefinitely.  Punishments in abundance preceded\r\nand accompanied the edicts; from the 10th of November, 1534, to the 3d of\r\nMay, 1535, twenty-four heretics were burned alive in Paris, without\r\ncounting many who were sentenced to less cruel penalties.  The procedure\r\nhad been made more rapid; the police commissioner of the Chatelet dealt\r\nwith cases summarily, and the Parliament confirmed.  The victims had at\r\nfirst been strangled before they were burned; they were now burned alive,\r\nafter the fashion of the Spanish Inquisition.  The convicts were\r\nsuspended by iron chains to beams which alternately “hoisted” and\r\n“lowered” them over the flames until the executioner cut the cord to let\r\nthe sufferer fall.  The evidence was burned together with the convicts;\r\nit was undesirable that the Reformers should be able to make a certified\r\ncollection of their martyrs’ acts and deeds.\r\n\r\nAfter a detailed and almost complacent enumeration of all these\r\nexecutions, we find in the _Journal d’un Bourgeois de Paris_ this\r\nparagraph: “The rumor was, in June, 1535, that Pope Paul III., being\r\nadvertised of the execrable and horrible justice which the king was doing\r\nupon the Lutherans in his kingdom, did send word to the King of France\r\nthat he was advertised of it, and that he was quite willing to suppose\r\nthat he did it in good part, as he still made use of the beautiful title\r\nhe had to be called the Most Christian king; nevertheless, God the\r\nCreator, when he was in this world, made more use of mercy than of\r\nrigorous justice, which should never be used rigorously; and that it was\r\na cruel death to burn a man alive because he might have to some extent\r\nrenounced the faith and the law.  Wherefore the pope did pray and request\r\nthe king, by his letters, to be pleased to mitigate the fury and rigor of\r\nhis justice by granting grace and pardon.  The king, wishing to follow\r\nthe pope’s wishes, according as he had sent him word by his letters\r\npatent, sent word to the court of Parliament not to proceed any more with\r\nsuch rigor as they had shown heretofore.  For this cause were there no\r\nmore rigorous proceedings on the part of justice.”  [_Journal d’un\r\nBourgeois de Paris,_ p. 456.]\r\n\r\nSearch has been made to discover whether the assertion of the Bourgeois\r\nde Paris has any foundation, whether Pope Paul III. really did write in\r\nJune, 1535, the letter attributed to him, and whether its effect was,\r\nthat the king wrote to Parliament not to proceed against the Reformers\r\n“with such rigor.”  No proof has, however, been obtained as to the\r\nauthenticity of the pope’s letter, and in any case it was not very\r\neffectual, for the same _Bourgeois de Paris_ reports, that in September,\r\n1535, three months after that, according to him, it was written: Two\r\nfellows, makers of silk ribbons and tissues, were burned all alive, one\r\nin the Place Maubert and the other in St. John’s cemetery, as Lutherans,\r\nwhich they were.  They had handed over to their host at Paris some\r\nLutheran books to take care of, saying, ‘Keep this book for us while we\r\ngo into the city, and show it to nobody.’  When they were gone, this host\r\nwas not able to refrain from showing this book to a certain priest, the\r\nwhich, after having looked at it, said incontinently, ‘This is a very\r\nwicked book, and proscribed.’  Then the said host went to the\r\ncommissioner of police to reveal that he had such and such a book of such\r\nan one, the which sent forth with to the house of the said host to take\r\nand carry off the said two fellows to the Chatelet.  Being questioned,\r\nthey confessed the state of the case.  Whereupon, by sentence of the said\r\ncommissioner, confirmed by decree, “they made honorable amends in front of\r\nthe church of Notre-Dame de Paris, had their tongues cut out, and were\r\nburned all alive and with unshaken obstinacy.”  Proceedings and\r\nexecutions, then, did not cease, even in the case of the most humble\r\nclass of Reformers, and at the very moment when Francis I. was exerting\r\nhimself to win over the Protestants of Germany with the cry of\r\nconciliation and re-establishment of harmony in the church.  Melancthon,\r\nBucer, and Luther himself had allowed themselves to be tempted by the\r\nprospect; but the German politicians, princes, and counsellors were more\r\nclear-sighted.  “We at Augsburg,” wrote Sailer, deputy from that city,\r\n“know the King of France well; he cares very little for religion, or even\r\nfor morality.  He plays the hypocrite with the pope, and gives the\r\nGermans the smooth side of his tongue, thinking of nothing but how to\r\ncheat them of the hopes he gives them.  His only aim is to crush the\r\nemperor.”  The attempt of Francis I. thus failed, first in Germany, and\r\nthen at Paris also, where the Sorbonne was not disposed, any more than\r\nthe German politicians were, to listen to any talk about a specious\r\nconciliation; and the persecution resumed its course in France, paving\r\nthe way for civil war.\r\n\r\nThe last and most atrocious act of persecution in the reign of Francis I.\r\nwas directed not against isolated individuals, but against a whole\r\npopulation, harried, despoiled, and banished or exterminated on account\r\nof heresy.  About the year 1525 small churches of Reformers began to\r\nassume organization between the Alps and the Jura.  Something was there\r\nsaid about Christians who belonged to the Reformation without having ever\r\nbeen reformed.  It was said that, in certain valleys of the Piedmontese\r\nAlps and Dauphiny and in certain quarters of Provence, there were to be\r\nfound believers who for several centuries had recognized no authority\r\nsave that of the Holy Scriptures.  Some called them Vaudians\r\n(Waldensians), others poor of Lyons, others Lutherans.  The rumor of the\r\nReformation was heard in their valleys, and created a lively emotion\r\namongst them.  One of them determined to go and see what this reformation\r\nwas; and he returned to his valleys with good news and with pious books.\r\nRegular relations were from that time established between the Reformers\r\nof Switzerland, France, and Germany, and the Christian shepherds of these\r\nmountains.  Visits were exchanged Farel and Saunier went amongst the\r\nVaudians and conversed with them about their common faith, common in\r\nspite of certain differences.  Rustic conferences, composed of the\r\nprincipal landholders, barbas or pastors, and simple members of the\r\nfaithful, met more than once in the open air under the pines of their\r\nmountains.  The Vaudians of Provence had been settled there since the end\r\nof the thirteenth century; and in the course of the fourteenth other\r\nVaudians from Dauphiny, and even from Calabria, had come thither to join\r\nthem.  “Their barbas,” says a contemporary monk [_Histoire des Guerres\r\nexcitees dans le Comtat venaissin par les Calvinistes du seizieme siecle,\r\npar le pere Justin, capucin_], “used to preside at their exercises of\r\nreligion, which were performed in secret.  As they were observed to be\r\nquiet and circumspect, as they faithfully paid taxes, tithe, and\r\nseigniorial dues, and as they were besides very laborious, they were not\r\ntroubled on the score of their habits and doctrines.”  Their new friends\r\nfrom Switzerland and Germany reproached them with concealment of their\r\nfaith and worship.  As soon as they had overtly separated from the Roman\r\nchurch, persecution began; Francis I. checked its first excesses, but it\r\nsoon began again; the episcopal prisons were filled with Vaudians, who\r\nbristled at the summons to abjure; and on the 29th of March, 1535,\r\nthirteen of them were sentenced to be burned alive.  Pope Paul III.\r\ncomplained to Francis I. of their obstinacy; the king wrote about it to\r\nthe Parliament of Aix; the Parliament ordered the lords of the lands\r\noccupied by the Vaudians to force their vassals to abjure or leave the\r\ncountry.  When cited to appear before the court of Aix to explain the\r\ngrounds of their refusal, several declined.  The court sentenced them, in\r\ndefault, to be burned alive.  Their friends took up arms and went to\r\ndeliver the prisoners.  Merindol was understood to be the principal\r\nretreat of the sectaries; by decree of November 18, 1540, the Parliament\r\nordered that “the houses should be demolished and razed to the ground,\r\nthe cellars filled up, the woods cut down, the trees of the gardens torn\r\nup, and that the lands of those who had lived in Merindol should not be\r\nable to be farmed out to anybody whatever of their family or name.”  In\r\nthe region of Parliament itself complaints were raised against such\r\nhardships; the premier president, Barthelemy Chassaneuz, was touched, and\r\nadjourned the execution of the decree.  The king commissioned William du\r\nBellay to examine into the facts; the report of Du Bellay was favorable\r\nto the Vaudians, as honest, laborious, and charitable farmers,\r\ndischarging all the duties of civil life; but, at the same time, he\r\nacknowledged that they did not conform to the laws of the church, that\r\nthey did not recognize the pope or the bishops, that they prayed in the\r\nvulgar tongue, and that they were in the habit of choosing certain\r\npersons from amongst themselves to be their pastors.  On this report,\r\nFrancis I., by a declaration of February 18, 1541, pardoned the Vaudians\r\nfor all that had been irregular in their conduct, on condition that\r\nwithin the space of three months they should abjure their errors; and he\r\nordered the Parliament to send to Aix deputies from their towns, burghs,\r\nand villages, to make abjuration in the name of all, at the same time\r\nauthorizing the Parliament to punish, according to the ordinances, those\r\nwho should refuse to obey, and to make use, if need were, of the services\r\nof the soldiery.  Thus persecuted and condemned for their mere faith,\r\nundemonstrative as it was, the Vaudians confined themselves to asking\r\nthat it might be examined and its errors pointed out.  Those of Merindol\r\nand those of Cabriere in the countship of Venasque drew up their\r\nprofession of faith and sent it to the king and to two bishops of the\r\nprovince, Cardinal Sadolet, Bishop of Carpentras, and John Durandi,\r\nBishop of Cavaillon, whose equity and moderation inspired them with some\r\nconfidence.  Cardinal Sadolet did not belie their expectation; he\r\nreceived them with kindness, discussed with them their profession of\r\nfaith, pointed out to them divers articles which might be remodelled\r\nwithout disavowing the basis of their creed, and assured them that it\r\nwould always be against his sentiments to have them treated as enemies.\r\n“I am astonished,” he wrote to the pope, “that these folks should be\r\npersecuted when the Jews are spared.”  The Bishop of Cavaillon testified\r\ntowards them a favor less unalloyed: “I was quite sure,” said he, “that\r\nthere was not so much mischief amongst you as was supposed; however, to\r\ncalm men’s minds, it is necessary that you should submit to a certain\r\nappearance of abjuration.”  “But what would you have us abjure, if we are\r\nalready within the truth?”  “It is but a simple formality that I demand\r\nof you; I do not require in your case notary or signature; if you are\r\nunwilling to assent to this abjuration, none can argue you into it.”  “We\r\nare plain men, monseigneur; we are unwilling to do anything to which we\r\ncannot assent;” and they persisted in their refusal to abjure.  Cardinal\r\nSadolet was summoned to Rome, and the premier president Chassaneuz died\r\nsuddenly.  His successor, John de Maynier, Baron of Oppede, was a violent\r\nman, passionately bigoted, and moreover, it is said, a personal enemy of\r\nthe Vaudians of Cabrieres, on which his estates bordered; he recommenced\r\nagainst them a persecution which was at first covert; they had found\r\nprotectors in Switzerland and in Germany; at the instance of Calvin, the\r\nSwiss Protestant cantons and the German princes assembled at Smalkalden\r\nwrote to Francis I. in their favor; it was to his interest to humor the\r\nProtestants of Germany, and that fact turned out to the advantage of the\r\nVaudians of Provence; on the 14th of June, 1544, he issued an edict\r\nwhich, suspending the proceedings commenced against them, restored to\r\nthem their privileges, and ordered such of them as were prisoners to be\r\nset at large; “and as the attorney-general of Provence,” it goes on to\r\nsay, “is related to the Archbishop of Aix, their sworn enemy, there will\r\nbe sent in his place a counsellor of the court for to inform me of their\r\ninnocence.”  But some months later the peace of Crespy was made; and\r\nFrancis I. felt no longer the same solicitude about humoring the\r\nProtestants of Switzerland and Germany.  Baron d’Oppede zealously resumed\r\nhis work against the Vaudians; he accused them of intriguing; with\r\nforeign Reformers, and of designing to raise fifteen thousand men to\r\nsurprise Marseilles and form Provence into a republic.  On the 1st of\r\nJanuary, 1545, Francis I. signed, without reading it they say, the\r\nrevocation of his edict of 1544, and ordered execution of the decree\r\nissued by the Parliament of Aix, dated November 18, 1540, on the subject\r\nof the Vaudians, “notwithstanding all letters of grace posterior to that\r\nepoch, and ordered the governor of the province to give, for that\r\npurpose, the assistance of the strong hand to justice.”  The duty of\r\nassisting justice was assigned to Baron d’Oppede; and from the 7th to the\r\n25th of April, 1545, two columns of troops, under the orders,\r\nrespectively, of Oppede himself and Baron de la Garde, ravaged with fire\r\nand sword the three districts of Merindol, Cabrieres, and La Coste, which\r\nwere peopled chiefly by Vaudians.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Massacre of the Vaudians----218]\r\n\r\nWe shrink from describing in detail all the horrors committed against a\r\npopulation without any means of self-defence by troops giving free rein\r\nto their brutal passions and gratifying the hateful passions of their\r\nleaders.  In the end three small towns and twenty-two villages were\r\ncompletely sacked; seven hundred and sixty-three houses, eighty-nine\r\ncattle-sheds, and thirty-one barns burned; three thousand persons\r\nmassacred; two hundred and fifty-five executed subsequently to the\r\nmassacre, after a mockery of trial; six or seven hundred sent to the\r\ngalleys; many children sold for slaves; and the victors, on retiring,\r\nleft behind them a double ordinance, from the Parliament of Aix and the\r\nvice-legate of Avignon, dated the 24th of April, 1545, forbidding “that\r\nany one, on pain of death, should dare to give asylum, aid, or succor, or\r\nfurnish money or victuals, to any Vaudian or heretic.”\r\n\r\nIt is said that Francis I., when near his end, repented of this odious\r\nextermination of a small population, which, with his usual fickleness and\r\ncarelessness, he had at one time protected, and at another abandoned to\r\nits enemies.  Amongst his last words to his son Henry II. was an\r\nexhortation to cause an inquiry to be made into the iniquities committed\r\nby the Parliament of Aix in this instance.  It will be seen, at the\r\nopening of Henry II.’s reign, what was the result of this exhortation of\r\nhis father’s.\r\n\r\nCalvin was lately mentioned as having pleaded the cause of the Vaudians,\r\nin 1544, amongst the Protestants of Switzerland and Germany.  It was from\r\nGeneva, where he had lived and been the dominant spirit for many years,\r\nthat the French Reformer had exercised such influence over the chiefs of\r\nthe German Reformation in favor of that small population whose creed and\r\nmorals had anticipated by several centuries the Reformation in the\r\nsixteenth century.  He was born, in 1509 at Noyon in Picardy, was brought\r\nup in the bosom of the Catholic church, and held a cure in 1527 at\r\nPont-l’Eveque, where he preached several times, “joyous and almost\r\nproud,” as he said himself, “that a single dissertation had brought me\r\na cure.”  In 1534, study, meditation on the Gospels, discussion of the\r\nreligious and moral questions raised on every side, and the free\r\natmosphere of the new spirit that was abroad, changed his convictions and\r\nhis resolves; he abandoned the career of the law as well as that of the\r\nestablished church, resigned his cure at Pont-l’Eveque, and devoted\r\nhimself entirely to the work of the nascent and much opposed Reformation.\r\nHaving a mind that was judicious and free from illusion in the very heat\r\nof passion, he soon saw to what an extent the success of the Reformation\r\nin France was difficult and problematical; in 1535, impressed by the\r\nobstacles it met with even more than by the dangers it evoked, he\r\nresolved to leave his country and go else whither in search of security,\r\nliberty, and the possibility of defending a cause which became the dearer\r\nto him in proportion as it was the more persecuted.  He had too much\r\nsagacity not to perceive that he was rapidly exhausting his various\r\nplaces of asylum: Queen Marguerite of Navarre was unwilling to try too\r\nfar the temper of the king her brother; Canon Louis du Tillet was a\r\nlittle fearful lest his splendid library should be somewhat endangered\r\nthrough the use made of it by his guest, who went about, arguing or\r\npreaching, in the vicinity of Angouleme; the queen’s almoner, Gerard\r\nRoussel, considered that Calvin was going too far, and grew apprehensive\r\nlest, if the Reformation should completely succeed, it might suppress the\r\nbishopric of Oleron which he desired, and which, indeed, he at a later\r\nperiod obtained.  Lefevre of Etaples, who was the most of all in sympathy\r\nwith Calvin, was seventy-nine years old, and had made up his mind to pass\r\nhis last days in peace.  Calvin quitted Angouleme and Nerac, and went to\r\npass some time at Poitiers, where the friends of the Reformation,\r\nassembling round him and hanging upon his words, for the first time\r\ncelebrated the Lord’s Supper in a grotto close to the town, which still\r\ngoes by the name of Calvin’s Grotto.  Being soon obliged to leave\r\nPoitiers, Calvin went to Orleans, then secretly to Paris, then to Noyon\r\nto see his family once more, and set out at last for Strasbourg, already\r\none of the strongholds of the Reformation, where he had friends, amongst\r\nothers the learned Bucer, with whom he had kept up a constant\r\ncorrespondence.  He arrived there at the beginning of the year 1535; but\r\nit was not at Strasbourg that he took up his quarters; he preferred Bale,\r\nwhere also there was a reunion of men of letters, scholars, and\r\ncelebrated printers, Erasmus, Simon Grynee (Grymeus), and the Frobens,\r\nand where Calvin calculated upon finding the leisure and aid he required\r\nfor executing the great work he had been for some time contemplating--his\r\n_Institution de la Religion chretienne_ (Christian Institutes). This\r\nwould not be the place, and we have no intention, to sum up the religious\r\ndoctrines of that book; we might challenge many of them as contrary to\r\nthe true meaning and moral tendency of Christianity; but we desire to set\r\nin a clear light their distinctive and original characteristics, which\r\nare those of Calvin himself in the midst of his age.  These\r\ncharacteristics are revealed in the preface and even in the dedication of\r\nthe book.  It is to Francis I., the persecutor of the French Reformers,\r\nduring one of the most cruel stages of the persecution, and at the very\r\nmoment when he had just left his own country in order that he may live in\r\nsecurity and speak with freedom, that Calvin dedicates his work.  “Do not\r\nimagine,” he says to the king, “that I am attempting here my own special\r\ndefence in order to obtain permission to return to the country of my\r\nbirth, from which, although I feel for it such human affection as is my\r\nbounden duty, yet, as things are now, I do not suffer any great anguish\r\nat being cut off.  But I am taking up the cause of all the faithful, and\r\neven that of Christ, which is in these days so mangled and down-trodden\r\nin your kingdom that it seems to be in a desperate plight.  And this has\r\nno doubt come to pass rather through the tyranny of certain Pharisees\r\nthan of your own will.”  Calvin was at the same time the boldest and the\r\nleast revolutionary amongst the innovators of the sixteenth century; bold\r\nas a Christian thinker, but full of deference and consideration towards\r\nauthority, even when he was flagrantly withdrawing himself from it.  The\r\nidea of his book was at first exclusively religious, and intended for the\r\nbulk of the French Reformers; but at the moment when Calvin is about to\r\npublish it, prudence and policy recur to his mind, and it is to the King\r\nof France that he addresses himself; it is the authority of the royal\r\npersecutor that he invokes; it is the reason of Francis I. that he\r\nattempts to convince.  He acts like a respectful and faithful subject,\r\nas well as an independent and innovating Christian.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Calvin----222]\r\n\r\nAfter having wandered for some time longer in Switzerland, Germany, and\r\nItaly, Calvin in 1536 arrived at Geneva.  It was at this time a small\r\nindependent republic, which had bravely emancipated itself from the\r\ndomination of the Dukes of Savoy, and in which the Reformation had\r\nacquired strength, but it had not yet got rid of that lawless and\r\nprecarious condition which is the first phase presented by revolutionary\r\ninnovations after victory; neither the political nor the religious\r\ncommunity at Geneva had yet received any organization which could be\r\ncalled regular or regarded as definitive; the two communities had not yet\r\nunderstood and regulated their reciprocal positions and the terms on\r\nwhich they were to live together.  All was ferment and haze in this\r\nlittle nascent state, as regarded the mental as well as the actual\r\ncondition, when Calvin arrived there; his name was already almost famous\r\nthere; he had given proofs of devotion to the cause of the Reformation;\r\nhis book on the _Institution de la Religion chretienne_ had just\r\nappeared; a great instinct for organization was strikingly evinced in it,\r\nat the same time that the dedication to Francis I. testified to a serious\r\nregard for the principle of authority and for its rights, as well as the\r\npart it ought to perform in human communities.  Calvin had many friends\r\nin Switzerland, and they urged him to settle at once at Geneva, and to\r\nlabor at establishing there Christian order in the Reformed church\r\nsimultaneously with its independence and its religious liberties in its\r\nrelations with the civil estate.  At first Calvin hesitated and resisted;\r\nhe was one of those who take strict account, beforehand, of the\r\ndifficulties to be encountered and the trials to be undergone in any\r\nenterprise for the success of which they are most desirous, and who\r\ninwardly shudder at the prospect of such a burden.  But the Christian’s\r\nduty, the Reformer’s zeal, the lively apprehension of the perils which\r\nwere being incurred by the cause of the Reformation, and the nobly\r\nambitious hope of delivering it,--these sentiments united prevailed over\r\nthe first misgivings of that great and mighty soul, and Calvin devoted\r\nhimself in Geneva to a work which, from 1536 to 1564, in a course of\r\nviolent struggles and painful vicissitudes, was to absorb and rapidly\r\nconsume his whole life.\r\n\r\nFrom that time forth a principle, we should rather say a passion, held\r\nsway in Calvin’s heart, and was his guiding star in the permanent\r\norganization of the church which he founded, as well as in his personal\r\nconduct during his life.  That principle is the profound distinction\r\nbetween the religious and the civil community.  Distinction we say, and\r\nby no means separation; Calvin, on the contrary, desired alliance between\r\nthe two communities and the two powers, but each to be independent in its\r\nown domain, combining their action, showing mutual respect and lending\r\nmutual support.  To this alliance he looked for the reformation and moral\r\ndiscipline of the members of the church placed under the authority of its\r\nown special religious officers and upheld by the indirect influence of\r\nthe civil power.\r\n\r\nIn this principle and this fundamental labor of Calvin’s there were two\r\nnew and bold reforms attempted in the very heart of the great Reformation\r\nin Europe, and over and above the work of its first promoters.  Henry\r\nVIII., on removing the church of England from the domination of the\r\npapacy, had proclaimed himself its head, and the church of England had\r\naccepted this royal supremacy.  Zwingle, when he provoked in German\r\nSwitzerland the rupture with the church of Rome, had approved of the\r\narrangement that the sovereign authority in matters of religion should\r\npass into the hands of the civil powers.  Luther himself, at the same\r\ntime that he reserved to the new German church a certain measure of\r\nspontaneity and liberty, had placed it under the protection and\r\npreponderance of laic sovereigns.  In this great question as to the\r\nrelations between church and state Calvin desired and did more than his\r\npredecessors; even before he played any considerable part in the European\r\nReformation, as soon as he heard of Henry VIII.’s religious supremacy in\r\nEngland, he had strongly declared against such a regimen; with an\r\nequitable spirit rare in his day, and in spite of his contest with the\r\nchurch of Rome, he was struck with the strength and dignity conferred\r\nupon that church by its having an existence distinct from the civil\r\ncommunity, and by the independence of its head.  When he himself became a\r\ngreat Reformer, he did not wish the Reformed church to lose this grand\r\ncharacteristic; whilst proclaiming it evangelical, he demanded for it in\r\nmatters of faith and discipline the independence and special authority\r\nwhich had been possessed by the primitive church; and in spite of the\r\nresistance often shown to him by the civil magistrates, in spite of the\r\nconcessions he was sometimes obliged to make to them, he firmly\r\nmaintained this principle, and he secured to the Reformed church\r\nof Geneva, in purely religious questions and affairs, the right of\r\nself-government, according to the faith and the law as they stand\r\nwritten in the Holy Books.\r\n\r\nHe at the same time put in force in this church a second principle of no\r\nless importance.  In the course of ages, and by a series of successive\r\nmodifications, some natural and others factitious and illegitimate, the\r\nChristian church had become, so to speak, cut in two, into the\r\necclesiastical community and the religious community, the clergy and the\r\nworshippers.  In the Catholic church the power was entirely in the hands\r\nof the clergy; the ecclesiastical body completely governed the religious\r\nbody; and, whilst the latter was advancing more and more in laic ideas\r\nand sentiments, the former remained even more and more distinct and\r\nsovereign.  The German and English Reformations had already modified this\r\nstate of things, and given to the lay community a certain portion of\r\ninfluence in religious questions and affairs.  Calvin provided for the\r\nmatter in a still more direct and effectual fashion, not only as regarded\r\naffairs in general, but even the choice of pastors; he gave admission to\r\nlaymen, in larger number too than that of the ecclesiastics, into the\r\nconsistories and synods, the governing authorities in the Reformed\r\nchurch.  He thus did away with the separation between the clergy and the\r\nworshippers; he called upon them to deliberate and act together; and he\r\nsecured to the religious community, in its entirety, their share of\r\nauthority in the affairs and fortunes of the church.\r\n\r\nThus began at Geneva, under the inspiration and through the influence of\r\nCalvin, that ecclesiastical organization which, developing, completing,\r\nand modifying itself according to the requirements of places and times,\r\nbecame, under the name of Presbyterian regimen, the regimen of the\r\nReformed churches in France, French Switzerland, Holland, Scotland, and\r\namongst a considerable portion of the Protestant population in England\r\nand in the United States of America--a regimen evangelical in origin and\r\ncharacter, republican in some of its maxims and institutions, but no\r\nstranger to the principle of authority, one which admitted of discipline\r\nand was calculated for duration, and which has kept for three centuries,\r\namongst the most civilized people, a large measure of Christian faith,\r\necclesiastical order, and civil liberty.  It was a French refugee who\r\ninstituted, in a foreign city, this regimen, and left it as a legacy to\r\nthe French Reformation and to the numerous Christian communities who were\r\neager to adopt it.  It is on this ground that Calvin takes a place in the\r\nhistory of France, and has a fair right to be counted amongst the eminent\r\nmen who have carried to a distance the influence, the language, and the\r\nfame of the country in the bosom of which it was not permitted them to\r\nlive and labor. In 1547, when the death of Francis I. was at hand, that\r\necclesiastical organization of Protestantism which Calvin had instituted\r\nat Geneva was not even begun in France.  The French Protestants were as\r\nyet but isolated and scattered individuals, without any bond of generally\r\naccepted and practised faith or discipline, and without any eminent and\r\nrecognized heads.  The Reformation pursued its course; but a Reformed\r\nchurch did not exist.  And this confused mass of Reformers and Reformed\r\nhad to face an old, a powerful, and a strongly constituted church, which\r\nlooked upon the innovators as rebels over whom it had every right as much\r\nas against them it had every arm.  In each of the two camps prevailed\r\nerrors of enormous magnitude, and fruitful of fatal consequences;\r\nCatholics and Protestants both believed themselves to be in exclusive\r\npossession of the truth, of all religious truth, and to have the right of\r\nimposing it by force upon their adversaries the moment they had the\r\npower.  Both were strangers to any respect for human conscience, human\r\nthought, and human liberty.  Those who had clamored for this on their own\r\naccount when they were weak had no regard for it in respect of others\r\nwhen they felt themselves to be strong.  On the side of the Protestants\r\nthe ferment was at full heat, but as yet vague and unsettled; on the part\r\nof the Catholics the persecution was unscrupulous and unlimited. Such was\r\nthe position and such the state of feeling in which Francis I., at his\r\ndeath on the 31st of March, 1547, left the two parties that had already\r\nbeen at grips during his reign.  He had not succeeded either in\r\nreconciling them or in securing the triumph of that which had his favor\r\nand the defeat of that which he would have liked to vanquish.  That was,\r\nin nearly all that he undertook, his fate; he lacked the spirit of\r\nsequence and steady persistence, and his merits as well as his defects\r\nalmost equally urged him on to rashly attempt that which he only\r\nincompletely executed.  He was neither prudent nor persevering, and he\r\nmay be almost said to have laid himself out to please everybody rather\r\nthan to succeed in one and the same great purpose.  A short time before\r\nhis death a Venetian ambassador who had resided a long while at his\r\ncourt, Marino Cavalli, drew up and forwarded to the Senate of Venice a\r\nportrait of him so observantly sketched and so full of truth that it must\r\nbe placed here side by side with the more exacting and more severe\r\njudgment already pronounced here touching this brilliant but by no means\r\nfar-sighted or effective king.\r\n\r\n“The king is now fifty years of age; his aspect is in every respect\r\nkingly, insomuch that, without ever having seen his face or his portrait,\r\nany one, on merely looking at him, would say at once: ‘That is the king.’\r\nAll his movements are so noble and majestic that no prince could equal\r\nthem.  His constitution is robust, in spite of the excessive fatigue he\r\nhas constantly undergone and still undergoes in so many expeditions and\r\ntravels.  He eats and drinks a great deal, sleeps still better, and, what\r\nis more, dreams of nothing but leading a jolly life.  He is rather fond\r\nof being an exquisite in his dress, which is slashed and laced, and rich\r\nwith jewelry and precious stones; even his doublets are daintily worked\r\nand of golden tissue; his shirt is very fine, and it shows through an\r\nopening in the doublet, according to the fashion of France.  This\r\ndelicate and dainty way of living contributes to his health.  In\r\nproportion as the king bears bodily fatigue well, and endures it without\r\nbending beneath the burden, in the same proportion do mental cares weigh\r\nheavily upon him, and he shifts them almost entirely on to Cardinal de\r\nTournon and Admiral Annebault.  He takes no resolve, he makes no reply,\r\nwithout having had their advice; and if ever, which is very rare, an\r\nanswer happens to be given or a concession made without having received\r\nthe approval of these two advisers, he revokes it or modifies it.  But in\r\nwhat concerns the great affairs of state, peace or war, his Majesty,\r\ndocile as he is in everything else, will have the rest obedient to his\r\nwishes.  In that case there is nobody at court, whatever authority he may\r\npossess, who dare gainsay his Majesty.  This prince has a very sound\r\njudgment and a great deal of information; there is no sort of thing, or\r\nstudy or art, about which he cannot converse very much to the point.  It\r\nis true that, when people see how, in spite of his knowledge and his fine\r\ntalk, all his warlike enterprises have turned out ill, they say that all\r\nhis wisdom lies on his lips, and not in his mind.  But I think that the\r\ncalamities of this king come from lack of men capable of properly\r\ncarrying out his designs.  As for him, he will never have anything to do\r\nwith the execution, or even with the superintendence of it in any way; it\r\nseems to him quite enough to know his own part, which is to command and\r\nto supply plans.  Accordingly, that which might be wished for in him is\r\na little more care and patience, not by any means more experience and\r\nknowledge.  His Majesty readily pardons offences; and he becomes heartily\r\nreconciled with those whom he has offended.”  [_Relations des\r\nAmbassadeurs venitiens sur les Affaires de France au seizieme siecle, in\r\nthe Documents inedits sur l’Histoire de France,_ translated by M.\r\nTommaseo, t. i.  pp. 279-283.]\r\n\r\nIt is said that at the close of his reign Francis I., in spite of all the\r\nresources of his mind and all his easy-going qualities, was much\r\ndepressed, and that he died in sadness and disquietude as to the future.\r\nOne may be inclined to think that, in his egotism, he was more sad on his\r\nown account than disquieted on that of his successors and of France.\r\nHowever that may be, he was assuredly far from foreseeing the terrible\r\ncivil war which began after him, and the crimes, as well as disasters,\r\nwhich it caused.  None of his more intimate circle was any longer in a\r\nposition to excite his solicitude: his mother, Louise of Savoy, had died\r\nsixteen years before him (September 22, 1531); his most able and most\r\nwicked adviser, Chancellor Duprat, twelve years (July 29, 1535).  His\r\nsister Marguerite survived him two years (she died December 21, 1549,)\r\n“disgusted with everything,” say the historians, and “weary of life,”\r\n said she herself:--\r\n\r\n               “No father now have I, no mother,\r\n               Sister or brother.\r\n               On God alone I now rely,\r\n               Who ruleth over earth and sky.\r\n               O world, I say good by to you;\r\n               To relatives and friendly ties,\r\n               To honors and to wealth, adieu;\r\n               I hold them all for enemies.”\r\n\r\nAnd yet Marguerite was loath to leave life.  She had always been troubled\r\nat the idea of death; when she was spoken to about eternal life, she\r\nwould shake her head sometimes, saying, “All that is true; but we remain\r\na mighty long while dead underground before arriving there.”  When she\r\nwas told that her end was near, she “considered that a very bitter word,”\r\n saying that “she was not so old but that she might still live some\r\nyears.”  She had been the most generous, the most affectionate, and the\r\nmost lovable person in a family and a court which were both corrupt, and\r\nof which she only too often acquiesced in the weaknesses and even vices,\r\nthough she always fought against their injustice and their cruelty.  She\r\nhad the honor of being the grandmother of Henry IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.----HENRY II. (1547-1559.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GALLERY HENRY II----230]\r\n\r\nHenry II. had all the defects, and, with the exception of personal\r\nbravery, not one amongst the brilliant and amiable qualities of the king\r\nhis father.  Like Francis I., he was rash and reckless in his resolves\r\nand enterprises, but without having the promptness, the fertility, and\r\nthe suppleness of mind which Francis I. displayed in getting out of the\r\nawkward positions in which he had placed himself, and in stalling off or\r\nmitigating the consequences of them.  Henry was as cold and ungenial as\r\nFrancis had been gracious and able to please: and whilst Francis I., even\r\nif he were a bad master to himself, was at any rate his own master, Henry\r\nII. submitted without resistance, and probably without knowing it, to the\r\ninfluence of the favorite who reigned in his house as well as in his\r\ncourt, and of the advisers who were predominant in his government.  Two\r\nfacts will suffice to set in a clear light, at the commencement of the\r\nnew reign, this regrettable analogy in the defects, and this profound\r\ndiversity in the mind, character, and conduct of the two kings.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of 1542, a grievous aggravation of the tax upon salt,\r\ncalled Babel, caused a violent insurrection in the town of Rochelle,\r\nwhich was exempted, it was said, by its traditional privileges from that\r\nimpost.  Not only was payment refused, but the commissioners were\r\nmaltreated and driven away.  Francis I. considered the matter grave\r\nenough to require his presence for its repression.  He repaired to\r\nRochelle with a numerous body of lanzknechts.  The terrified population\r\nappeared to have determined upon submission, and, having assembled in a\r\nmass at the town-hall, there awaited anxiously the king’s arrival.  On\r\nthe 1st of January, 1543, Francis I. entered the town in state,\r\nsurrounded by his escort.  The people’s advocate fell on his knees, and\r\nappealed to the king’s clemency in dealing with a revolt of which every\r\none repented.  The king, who was seated on a wooden boarding, rose up.\r\n“Speak we no more of revolt,” said he; “I desire neither to destroy your\r\npersons nor to seize your goods, as was lately done by the Emperor\r\nCharles to the Ghentese, whereby his hands are stained with blood; I long\r\nmore for the hearts of my subjects than for their lives and their riches.\r\nI will never at any time of my life think again of your offence, and I\r\npardon you without excepting a single thing.  I desire that the keys of\r\nyour city and your arms be given back to you, and that you be completely\r\nreinstated in your liberties and your privileges.”  The cheers of the\r\npeople responded to these words of the king.  “I think I have won your\r\nhearts,” said the king on retiring; “and I assure you, on the honor of a\r\ngentleman, that you have mine.  I desire that you ring your bells, for\r\nyou are pardoned.”  The Rochellese were let off for a fine of two hundred\r\nthousand francs, which the king gave to his keeper of the seals, Francis\r\nde Montholon, whom he wished to compensate for his good service.  The\r\nkeeper of the seals in his turn made a present of them to the town of\r\nRochelle to found a hospital.  But the ordinances as to the salt-tax were\r\nmaintained in principle, and their extension led, some years afterwards,\r\nto a rising of a more serious character, and very differently repressed.\r\n\r\nIn 1548, hardly a year after the accession of Henry II., and in the midst\r\nof the rejoicings he had gone to be present at in the north of Italy, he\r\nreceived news at Turin to the effect that in Guienne, Angoumois, and\r\nSaintonge a violent and pretty general insurrection had broken out\r\nagainst the salt-tax, which Francis I., shortly before his death, had made\r\nheavier in these provinces.  The local authorities in vain attempted to\r\nrepress the rising; the insurgent peasants scoured the country in strong\r\nbodies, giving free rein not only to their desires, but also to their\r\nrevengeful feelings; the most atrocious excesses of which a mob is\r\ncapable were committed; the director-general of the gabel was massacred\r\ncruelly; and two of his officers, at Angouleme, were strapped down stark\r\nnaked on a table, beaten to death, and had their bodies cast into the\r\nriver with the insulting remark, “Go, wicked gabellers, and salt the fish\r\nof the Charente.”  The King of Navarre’s lieutenant, being appealed to\r\nfor aid, summoned, but to no purpose, the Parliament of Bordeaux; he was\r\nforced to take refuge in Chateau-Trompette, and was massacred by the\r\npopulace whilst he was trying to get out; the president of the\r\nParliament, a most worthy magistrate, and very much beloved, it is said,\r\nby the people, only saved his own life by taking the oath prescribed by\r\nthe insurgents.  “This news,” says Vieilleville, in his contemporary\r\n_Memoires,_ “grievously afflicted the king; and the Constable de\r\nMontmorency represented to him that it was not the first time that these\r\npeople had been capricious, rebellious, and mutinous; for that in the\r\nreign of his lord and father, the late king, the Rochellese and\r\nsurrounding districts had forgotten themselves in like manner.  They\r\nought to be exterminated, and, in case of need, be replaced by a new\r\ncolony, that they might never return.  The said sir constable offered to\r\ntake the matter in hand, and with ten companies of the old hands whom he\r\nwould raise in Piedmont, and as many lanzknechts, a thousand men-at-arms\r\nall told, he promised to exact a full account, and satisfy his Majesty.”\r\n\r\nMontmorency was as good as his word.  When he arrived with his troops in\r\nGuienne, the people of Bordeaux, in a fit of terror, sent to Langon a\r\nlarge boat, most magnificently fitted up, in which were chambers and\r\nsaloons emblazoned with the arms of the said sir constable, with three or\r\nfour deputies to present it to him, and beg him to embark upon it, and\r\ndrop down to their city.  He repulsed them indignantly.  “Away, away,”\r\n said he, “with your boat and your keys; I will have nought to do with\r\nthem; I have others here with me which will make me other kind of opening\r\nthan yours.  I will have you all hanged; I will teach you to rebel\r\nagainst your king and murder his governor and his lieutenant.”  And he\r\ndid, in fact, enter Bordeaux on the 9th of October, 1548, by a breach\r\nwhich he had opened in the walls, and, after having traversed the city\r\nbetween two lines of soldiers and with his guns bearing on the suspected\r\npoints, he ordered the inhabitants to bring all their arms to the\r\ncitadel.  Executions followed immediately after this moral as well as\r\nmaterial victory.  “More than a hundred and forty persons were put to\r\ndeath by various kinds of punishments,” says Vieilleville; “and, by a\r\nmost equitable sentence, when the executioner had in his hands the three\r\ninsurgents who had beaten to death and thrown into the river the two\r\ncollectors of the Babel at Angouleme, he cast them all three into a fire\r\nwhich was ready at the spot, and said to them aloud, in conformity with\r\nthe judgment against them, ‘Go, rabid hounds, and grill the fish of the\r\nCharente, which ye salted with the bodies of the officers of your king\r\nand sovereign lord.’  As to civil death (loss of civil rights),” adds\r\nVieilleville, “nearly all the inhabitants made honorable amends in open\r\nstreet, on their knees, before the said my lords at the window, crying\r\nmercy and asking pardon; and more than a hundred, because of their youth,\r\nwere simply whipped.  Astounding fines and interdictions were laid as\r\nwell upon the body composing the court of Parliament as upon the\r\ntown-council and on a great number of private individuals.  The very\r\nbells were not exempt from experiencing the wrath and vengeance of the\r\nprince, for not a single one remained throughout the whole city or in the\r\nopen country--to say nothing of the clocks, which were not spared either\r\n--which was not broken up and confiscated to the king’s service for his\r\nguns.”\r\n\r\nThe insurrection at Bordeaux against the gabel in 1548 was certainly more\r\nserious than that of Rochelle in 1542; but it is also quite certain that\r\nFrancis I. would not have set about repressing it as Henry II. did; he\r\nwould have appeared there himself and risked his own person instead of\r\nleaving the matter to the harshest of his lieutenants, and he would have\r\nmore skilfully intermingled generosity with force, and kind words with\r\nacts of severity.  And that is one of the secrets of governing.  In 1549,\r\nscarcely a year after the revolt at Bordeaux, Henry II., then at Amiens,\r\ngranted to deputies from Poitou, Rochelle, the district of Aunis,\r\nLimousin, Perigord, and Saintonge, almost complete abolition of the Babel\r\nin Guienne, which paid the king, by way of compensation, two hundred\r\nthousand crowns of gold for the expenses of war or the redemption of\r\ncertain alienated domains.  We may admit that on the day after the revolt\r\nthe arbitrary and bloody proceedings of the Constable de Montmorency must\r\nhave produced upon the insurgents of Bordeaux the effect of a salutary\r\nfright; but we may doubt whether so cruel a repression was absolutely\r\nindispensable in 1548, when in 1549 the concession demanded in the former\r\nyear was to be recognized as necessary.\r\n\r\nAccording to De Thou and the majority of historians, it was on the\r\noccasion of the insurrection in Guienne against the Babel that Stephen\r\nde la Boetie, the young and intimate friend of Montaigne, wrote his\r\ncelebrated _Discours de la Servitude voluntaire, ou le Contre-un,_ an\r\neloquent declamation against monarchy.  But the testimony of Montaigne\r\nhimself upsets the theory of this coincidence; written in his own hand\r\nupon a manuscript, partly autograph, of the treatise by De la Boetie, is\r\na statement that it was the work “of a lad of sixteen.”  La Boetie was\r\nborn at Sarlat on the 1st of November, 1530, and was, therefore, sixteen\r\nin 1546, two years before the insurrection at Bordeaux.  The _Contre-un,_\r\nbesides, is a work of pure theory and general philosophy, containing no\r\nallusion at all to the events of the day, to the sedition in Guienne no\r\nmore than to any other.  This little work owed to Montaigne’s\r\naffectionate regard for its author a great portion of its celebrity.\r\nPublished for the first time, in 1578, in the _Memoires de l’Etat de\r\nFrance,_ after having up to that time run its course without any author’s\r\nname, any title, or any date, it was soon afterwards so completely\r\nforgotten that when, in the middle of the seventeenth century, Cardinal\r\nde Richelieu for the first time heard it mentioned, and “sent one of his\r\ngentlemen over the whole street of Saint-Jacques to inquire for _la\r\nServitude volontaire,_ all the publishers said, ‘We don’t know what it\r\nis.’  The son of one of them recollected something about it, and said to\r\nthe cardinal’s gentleman, ‘Sir, there is a book-fancier who has what you\r\nseek, but with no covers to it, and he wants five pistoles for it.’\r\n‘Very well,’ said the gentleman;” and the Cardinal do Richelieu paid\r\nfifty francs for the pleasure of reading the little political pamphlet by\r\n“a lad of sixteen,” which probably made very little impression upon him,\r\nbut which, thanks to the elegance and vivacity of its style, and the\r\naffectionate admiration of the greatest independent thinker of the\r\nsixteenth century, has found a place in the history of French literature.\r\n[_Memoires de Tallemant des Reaux,_ t. i.  p. 395.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Anne de Montmorency----235]\r\n\r\nHistory must do justice even to the men whose brutal violence she\r\nstigmatizes and reproves.  In the case of Anne do Montmorency it often\r\ntook the form of threats intended to save him from the necessity of acts.\r\nWhen he came upon a scene of any great confusion and disorder, “Go hang\r\nme such an one,” he would say; “tie yon fellow to that tree; despatch\r\nthis fellow with pikes and arquebuses, this very minute, right before my\r\neyes; cut me in pieces all those rascals who chose to hold such a\r\nclock-case as this against the king; burn me yonder village; light me up\r\na blaze everywhere, for a quarter of a mile all round.”  The same man\r\npaid the greatest attention to the discipline and good condition of his\r\ntroops, in order to save the populations from their requisitions and\r\nexcesses.  “On the 20th of November, 1549, he obtained and published at\r\nParis,” says De Thou, “a proclamation from the king doubling the pay of\r\nthe men-at-arms, arquebusiers and light-horse, and forbidding them at the\r\nsame time, on pain of death, to take anything without paying for it.  A\r\nbad habit had introduced itself amongst the troops, whether they were\r\ngoing on service or returning, whether they were in the field or in\r\nwinter quarters, of keeping themselves at the expense of those amongst\r\nwhom they lived.  Thence proceeded an infinity of irregularities and\r\nlosses in the towns and in the country, wherein the people had to suffer\r\nat the hands of an insolent soldiery the same vexatious as if it had been\r\nan enemy’s country.  Not only was a stop put to such excesses, but care\r\nwas further taken that the people should not be oppressed under pretext\r\nof recruitments which had to be carried out.”  [_Histoire de J. A. de\r\nThou,_ t. i.  p. 367.]  A nephew of the Constable de Montmorency, a young\r\nman of twenty-three, who at a later period became Admiral de Coligny, was\r\nordered to see to the execution of these protective measures, and he drew\r\nup, between 1550 and 1552, at first for his own regiment of foot, and\r\nafterwards as colonel-general of this army, rules of military discipline\r\nwhich remained for a long while in force.\r\n\r\nThere was war in the atmosphere.  The king and his advisers, the court\r\nand the people, had their minds almost equally full of it, some in sheer\r\ndread, and others with an eye to preparation.  The reign of Francis I.\r\nhad ended mournfully; the peace of Crespy had hurt the feelings both of\r\nroyalty and of the nation; Henry, now king, had, as dauphin, felt called\r\nupon to disavow it.  It had left England in possession of Calais and\r\nBoulogne, and confirmed the dominion or ascendency of Charles V. in\r\nGermany, Italy, and Spain, on all the French frontiers.  How was the\r\nstruggle to be recommenced?  What course must be adopted to sustain it\r\nsuccessfully?  To fall back upon, there were the seven provincial\r\nlegions, which had been formed by Francis I. for Normandy, Picardy,\r\nBurgundy, Dauphiny, and Provence united, Languedoc, Guienne, and\r\nBrittany; but they were not like permanent troops, drilled and always\r\nready; they were recruited by voluntary enlistment; they generally\r\nremained at their own homes, receiving compensation at review time and\r\nhigh pay in time of war.  The Constable de Montmorency had no confidence\r\nin these legions; he spoke of them contemptuously, and would much rather\r\nhave increased the number of the foreign corps, regularly paid and kept\r\nup, Swiss or lanzknechts.  Two systems of policy and warfare, moreover,\r\ndivided the king’s council into two: Montmorency, now old and worn out in\r\nbody and mind (he was born in 1492, and so was sixty in 1552), was for a\r\npurely defensive attitude, no adventures or battles to be sought, but\r\nvictuals and all sorts of supplies to be destroyed in the provinces which\r\nmight be invaded by the enemy, so that instead of winning victories there\r\nhe might not even be able to live there.  In 1536 this system had been\r\nfound successful by the constable in causing the failure of Charles V.’s\r\ninvasion of Provence; but in 1550 a new generation had come into the\r\nworld, the court, and the army; it comprised young men full of ardor and\r\nalready distinguished for their capacity and valor; Francis de Lorraine,\r\nDuke of Guise (born at the castle of Bar, February 17, 1519), was\r\nthirty-one; his brother, Charles de Guise, Cardinal of Lorraine, was only\r\nsix-and-twenty (he was born at Joinville, February 17, 1524); Francis de\r\nScepeaux (born at Durdtal, Anjou, in 1510), who afterwards became Marshal\r\nde Vieilleville, was at this time nearly forty; but he had contributed in\r\n1541 to the victory of Ceresole, and Francis I. had made so much of it\r\nthat he had said, on presenting him to his son Henry, “He is no older\r\nthan you, and see what he has done already; if the wars do not swallow\r\nhim up, you will some day make him constable or marshal of France.”\r\n Gaspard de Coligny (born at Chatillon-sur-Loing, February 16, 1517) was\r\nthirty-three; and his brother, Francis d’Andelot (born at Chatillon, in\r\n1521), twenty-nine.  These men, warriors and politicians at one and the\r\nsame time, in a high social position and in the flower of their age,\r\ncould not reconcile themselves to the Constable de Montmorency’s system,\r\ndefensive solely and prudential to the verge of inertness; they thought\r\nthat, in order to repair the reverses of France and for the sake of their\r\nown fame, there was something else to be done, and they impatiently\r\nawaited the opportunity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Henry II.----235]\r\n\r\nIt was not long coming.  At the close of 1551, a deputation of the\r\nProtestant princes of Germany came to Fontainebleau to ask for the king’s\r\nsupport against the aggressive and persecuting despotism of Charles V.\r\nThe Count of Nassau made a speech “very long,” says Vieilleville in his\r\n_Memoires,_ “at the same time that it was in very elegant language,\r\nwhereby all the presence received very great contentment.”  Next day the\r\nking put the demand before his council for consideration, and expressed\r\nat the very outset his own opinion that “in the present state of affairs,\r\nhe ought not to take up any enterprise, but leave his subjects of all\r\nconditions to rest; for generally,” said he, “all have suffered and do\r\nsuffer when armies pass and repass so often through my kingdom, which\r\ncannot be done without pitiable oppression and trampling-down of the poor\r\npeople.”  The constable, “without respect of persons,” says Vieilleville,\r\n“following his custom of not giving way to anybody, forthwith began to\r\nspeak, saying that the king, who asked counsel of them, had very plainly\r\ngiven it them himself and made them very clearly to understand his own\r\nidea, which ought to be followed point by point without any gainsaying,\r\nhe having said nothing but what was most equitable and well known to the\r\ncompany.”  Nearly all the members of the council gave in their adhesion,\r\nwithout comment, to the opinion of the king and the constable.  “But when\r\nit came to the turn of M. de Vieilleville, who had adopted the language\r\nof the Count of Nassau,” he unhesitatingly expressed a contrary opinion,\r\nunfolding all the reasons which the king had for being distrustful of the\r\nemperor and for not letting this chance of enfeebling him slip by.  “May\r\nit please your Majesty,” said he, “to remember his late passage through\r\nFrance, to obtain which the emperor submitted to carteblanche;\r\nnevertheless, when he was well out of the kingdom, he laughed at all his\r\npromises, and, when he found himself inside Cambrai, he said to the\r\nPrince of Infantado, ‘Let not the King of France, if he be wise, put\r\nhimself at my mercy, as I have been at his, for I swear by the living God\r\nthat he shall not be quit for Burgundy and Champagne; but I would also\r\ninsist upon Picardy and the key of the road to the Bastille of Paris,\r\nunless he were minded to lose his life or be confined in perpetual\r\nimprisonment until the whole of my wish were accomplished.’  Since thus\r\nit is, sir, and the emperor makes war upon you covertly, it must be made\r\nupon him overtly, without concealing one’s game or dissimulating at all.\r\nNo excuses must be allowed on the score of neediness, for France is\r\ninexhaustible, if only by voluntary loans raised on the most comfortable\r\nclasses of the realm.  As for me, I consider myself one of the poorest of\r\nthe company, or at any rate one of the least comfortable; but yet I have\r\nsome fifteen thousand francs’ worth of plate, dinner and dessert, white\r\nand red [silver and gold], which I hereby offer to place in the hands of\r\nwhomsoever you shall appoint, in order to contribute to the expenses of\r\nso laudable an enterprise as this.  Putting off, moreover, for the\r\npresent the communication to you of a certain secret matter which one of\r\nthe chiefs of this embassy hath told me; and I am certain that when you\r\nhave discovered it, you will employ all your might and means to carry out\r\nthat which I propose to you.”\r\n\r\nThe king asked Vieilleville what this secret matter was which he was\r\nkeeping back.  “If it please your Majesty to withdraw apart, I will tell\r\nit you,” said Vieilleville.  All the council rose; and Vieilleville,\r\napproaching his Majesty, who called the constable only to his side, said,\r\n“Sir, you are well aware how the emperor got himself possessed of the\r\nimperial cities of Cambrai, Utrecht, and Liege, which he has incorporated\r\nwith his own countship of Flanders, to the great detriment of the whole\r\nof Germany.  The electoral princes of the holy empire have discovered\r\nthat he has a project in his mind of doing just the same with the\r\nimperial cities of Metz, Strasbourg, Toul, Verdun, and such other towns\r\non the Rhine as he shall be able to get hold of.  They have secretly\r\nadopted the idea of throwing themselves upon your resources, without\r\nwhich they cannot stop this detestable design, which would be the total\r\nruin of the empire and a manifest loss to your kingdom.  Wherefore, take\r\npossession of the said towns, since opportunity offers, which will be\r\nabout forty leagues of country gained without the loss of a single man,\r\nand an impregnable rampart for Champagne and Picardy; and, besides, a\r\nfine and perfectly open road into the heart of the duchy of Luxembourg\r\nand the districts below it as far as Brussels.”\r\n\r\nHowever pacific the king’s first words had been, and whatever was the\r\ninfluence of the constable, the proposal of Vieilleville had a great\r\neffect upon the council.  The king showed great readiness to adopt it.\r\n“I think,” said he to the constable, “that I was inspired of God when I\r\ncreated Vieilleville of my council to-day.”  “I only gave the opinion I\r\ndid,” replied Montmorency, “in order to support the king’s sentiments;\r\nlet your Majesty give what orders you please.”  The king loudly\r\nproclaimed his resolve.  “Then let every one,” he said, “be ready at an\r\nearly date, with equipment according to his ability and means, to follow\r\nme; hoping, with God’s help, that all will go well for the discomfiture\r\nof so pernicious a foe of my kingdom and nation, and one who revels and\r\ndelights in tormenting all manner of folks, without regard for any.”\r\n There was a general enthusiasm; the place of meeting for the army was\r\nappointed at Chalons-sur-Marne, March 10, 1552; more than a thousand\r\ngentlemen flocked thither as volunteers; peasants and mechanics from\r\nChampagne and Picardy joined them; the war was popular.  “The majority of\r\nthe soldiers,” says Rabutin, a contemporary chronicler, “were young men\r\nwhose brains were on fire.”  Francis de Guise and Gaspard de Coligny were\r\ntheir chief leaders.  The king entered Lorraine from Champagne by\r\nJoinville, the ordinary residence of the Dukes of Guise.  He carried\r\nPont-a-Mousson; Toul opened its gates to him on the 13th of April; he\r\noccupied Nancy on the 14th, and on the 18th he entered Metz, not without\r\nsome hesitation amongst a portion of the inhabitants and the necessity of\r\na certain show of military force on the part of the leaders of the royal\r\narmy.  The king would have given the command of this important place to\r\nVieilleville, but he refused it, saying, “I humbly thank your Majesty,\r\nbut I do not think that you should establish in Metz any governor in your\r\nown name, but leave that duty to the mayor and sheriffs of the city,\r\nunder whose orders the eight captains of the old train-bands who will\r\nremain there with their companies will be.”  “How say you!” said the\r\nking: “can I leave a foreign lieutenant in a foreign country whose oath\r\nof fidelity I have only had within the last four-and-twenty hours, and\r\nwith all the difficulties and disputes in the world to meet too?”  “Sir,”\r\n rejoined Vieilleville, “to fear that this master sheriff, whose name is\r\nTallanges, might possibly do you a bad turn, is to wrongly estimate his\r\nown competence, who never put his nose anywhere but into a bar-parlor to\r\ndrink himself drunk; and it is also to show distrust of the excellent\r\nmeans you have for preventing all the ruses and artifices that might be\r\ninvented to throw your service into confusion.”  The king acquiesced, but\r\nnot without anxiety, in Vieilleville’s refusal, and, leaving at Metz as\r\ngovernor a relative of the constable’s, whom the latter warmly\r\nrecommended to him, he set out on the 22d of April, 1552, with all his\r\nhousehold, to go and attempt in Alsace the same process that he had\r\nalready carried out in Lorraine.  “But when we had entered upon the\r\nterritory of Germany,” says Vieilleville, “our Frenchmen at once showed\r\ntheir insolence in their very first quarters, which so alarmed all the\r\nrest that we never found from that moment a single man to speak to, and,\r\nas long as the expedition lasted, there never appeared a soul with his\r\nprovisions to sell on the road; whereby the army suffered infinite\r\nprivations.  This misfortune began with us at the approach to Saverne\r\n(Zabern), the episcopal residence of Strasbourg.”  When the king arrived\r\nbefore Strasbourg he found the gates closed, and the only offer to open\r\nthem was on the condition that he should enter alone with forty persons\r\nfor his whole suite.  The constable, having taken a rash fit, was of\r\nopinion that he should enter even on this condition.  This advice was\r\nconsidered by his Majesty to be very sound, as well as by the princes and\r\nlords who were about him, according to the natural tendency of the\r\nFrenchman, who is always for seconding and applauding what is said by the\r\ngreat.  But Vieilleville, on being summoned to the king’s quarters,\r\nopposed it strongly.  “Sir,” said he, “break this purpose, for in\r\ncarrying it out you are in danger of incurring some very evil and very\r\nshameful fate; and, should that happen, what will become of your army\r\nwhich will be left without head, prince, or captain, and in a strange\r\ncountry, wherein we are already looked upon with ill will because of our\r\ninsolence and indiscretions?  As for me, I am off again to my quarters to\r\nquaff and laugh with my two hundred men-at-arms, in readiness to march\r\nwhen your standard is a-field, but not thither.”  Nothing has a greater\r\neffect upon weak and undecided minds than the firm language of men\r\nresolved to do as they say.  The king gave up the idea of entering\r\nStrasbourg, and retired well pleased nevertheless, for he was in\r\npossession of Metz, Toul, Verdun, and Pont-a-Mousson, the keys for France\r\ninto Germany, and at the head of an army under young commanders who were\r\nenterprising without being blindly rash.\r\n\r\nCharles V. also had to know what necessity was, and to submit to it,\r\nwithout renouncing the totality of his designs.  On the 2d of August,\r\n1552, he signed at Passau, with the Protestant princes, the celebrated\r\ntreaty known under the name of “treaty of public peace,” which referred\r\nthe great questions of German pacification to a general diet to be\r\nassembled in six months, and declared that, pending definitive\r\nconciliation, the two religions should be on an equal footing in the\r\nempire, that is, that the princes and free towns should have the supreme\r\nregulation of religious matters amongst themselves.  Charles V. thus\r\nrecovered full liberty of action in his relations with France, and could\r\nno longer think of anything but how to recover the important towns he had\r\nlost in Lorraine.  Henry II., on the other hand, who was asked by his\r\nProtestant allies on what conditions he would accept the peace of Passau,\r\nreplied that at no price would he dispossess himself of the\r\nThree-Bishoprics of Lorraine, and that he would for his part continue the\r\ncontest he had undertaken for the liberation of Germany.  The siege of\r\nMetz then became the great question of the day: Charles V. made all his\r\npreparations to conduct it on an immense scale, and Henry II.\r\nimmediately ordered Francis de Guise to go and defend his new conquest at\r\nall hazards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIANA DE POITIERS----243]\r\n\r\nAmbition which is really great accepts with joy great perils fraught with\r\ngreat opportunities.  Guise wrote to Henry II.’s favorite, Diana de\r\nPoitiers, Duchess of Valentinois, to thank her for having helped to\r\nobtain for him this favor, which was about to bring him “to the emperor’s\r\nvery beard.”  He set out at once, first of all to Toul, where the plague\r\nprevailed, and where he wished to hurry on the repair of the ramparts.\r\nMoney was wanting to pay the working-corps; and he himself advanced the\r\nnecessary sum.  On arriving at Metz on the 17th of August, 1552, he found\r\nthere only twelve companies of infantry, new levies; and every evening he\r\ndrilled them himself in front of his quarters.  A host of volunteers,\r\ngreat lords, simple gentlemen, and rich and brave burgesses, soon came to\r\nhim, “eager to aid him in repelling the greatest and most powerful effort\r\never made by the emperor against their country and their king.”  This\r\nconcourse of warriors, the majority of them well known and several of\r\nthem distinguished, redoubled the confidence and ardor of the rank and\r\nfile in the army.  We find under the title of _Chanson faite en 1552 par\r\nun souldar etant en Metz en garnison_ this couplet:--\r\n\r\n               “My Lord of Guise is here at home,\r\n               With many a noble at his side,\r\n               With the two children of Vendome,\r\n               With bold Nemours, in all his pride,\r\n               And Strozzi too, a warrior tried,\r\n               Who ceases not, by night or day,\r\n               Around the city-walls to stride,\r\n               And strengthen Metz in every way.”\r\n\r\n     [Peter Strozzi, “the man in all the world,” says Brantome, “who\r\n     could best arrange and order battles and battalions, and could\r\n     best post them to his advantage.”]\r\n\r\nTo put into condition the tottering fortifications of Metz, and to have\r\nthe place well supplied, was the first task undertaken by its\r\nindefatigable governor; he never ceased to meet the calls upon him either\r\nin person or in purse; he was seen directing the workmen, taking his\r\nmeals with them, and setting them a good example by carrying the hod for\r\nseveral hours.  He frequently went out on horseback to reconnoitre the\r\ncountry, visit the points of approach and lodgment that the enemy might\r\nmake use of around the town, and take measures of precaution at the\r\nplaces whereby they might do harm as well as at those where it would be\r\nnot only advantageous for the French to make sallies or to set\r\nambuscades, but also to secure a retreat.  Charles V., naturally slow as\r\nhe was in his operations no less than in his resolves, gave the activity\r\nof Guise time to bear fruit.  “I mean to batter the town of Metz in such\r\nstyle as to knock it about the ears of M. de Guise,” said he at the end\r\nof August, 1552, “and I make small account of the other places that the\r\nking may have beyond that.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Guise at Metz----244]\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of September following, Charles was still fifteen leagues\r\nfrom Metz, on the territory of Deux-Ponts, and it was only on the 19th\r\nof October that the Duke of Alba, his captain-general, arrived with\r\ntwenty-four thousand men, the advance-guard, within a league of the\r\nplace which, it it is said, was to be ultimately besieged by one hundred\r\nthousand foot, twenty-three thousand horse, one hundred and twenty\r\npieces of artillery, and seven thousand pioneers.  “After one and the\r\nfirst encounter,” says a journal of the siege, “the enemy held our\r\nsoldiers in good repute, not having seen them, for any sort of danger,\r\nadvance or retreat, save as men of war and of assured courage; which was\r\nan advantage, for M. de Guise knew well that at the commencement of a\r\nwar it was requisite that a leader should try, as much as ever he could,\r\nto win.”  It was only on the 20th of November that Charles V., ill of\r\ngout at Thionville, and unable to stand on his legs, perceived the\r\nnecessity of being present in person at the siege, and appeared before\r\nMetz on an Arab horse, with his face pale and worn, his eyes sunk in his\r\nhead, and his beard white.  At sight of him there was a most tremendous\r\nsalute of arquebuses and artillery, the noise of which brought the whole\r\ntown to arms.  The emperor, whilst waiting to establish himself at the\r\ncastle of La Horgne, took up his quarters near the Duke of Alba, in a\r\nlittle wooden house built out of the ruins of the Abbey of\r\nSaint-Clement: “a beautiful palace,” said he, “when the keys of Metz are\r\nbrought to me there.”  From the 20th to the 26th the attack was\r\ncontinued with redoubled vigor; fourteen thousand cannon-shots were\r\nfired, it is said, in a single day Guise had remarked that the enemy\r\nseemed preparing to direct the principal assault against a point so\r\nstrong that nobody had thought of pulling down the houses in its\r\nvicinity.  This oversight was immediately repaired, and a stout wall,\r\nthe height of a man, made out of the ruins. “If they send us peas,” said\r\nGuise, “we will give them back beans” (“we will give them at least as\r\ngood as they bring “).  On the 26th of November the old wall was\r\nbattered by a formidable artillery; and, breached in three places, it\r\ncrumbled down on the 28th into the ditch, “at the same time making it\r\ndifficult to climb for to come to the assault.”  The assailants uttered\r\nshouts of joy; but, when the cloud of dust had cleared off, they saw a\r\nfresh rampart eight feet in height above the breach, “and they\r\nexperienced as much and even more disgust than they had felt pleasure at\r\nseeing the wall tumble.”  The besieged heaped mockery and insult upon\r\nthem; but Guise “imperatively put a stop to the disturbance, fearing, it\r\nis said, lest some traitor should take advantage of it to give the\r\nassailants some advice, and the soldiers then conceived the idea of\r\nsticking upon the points of their pikes live cats, the cries of which\r\nseemed to show derision of the enemy.”\r\n\r\nThe siege went on for a month longer without making any more impression;\r\nand the imperial troops kicked against any fresh assaults.  “I was wont\r\nonce upon a time to be followed to battle,” Charles V. would say,  “but I\r\nsee that I have no longer men about me; I must bid farewell to the\r\nempire, and go and shut myself up in some monastery; before three years\r\nare over I shall turn Cordelier.”  Whilst Metz was still holding out, the\r\nfortress of Toul was summoned by the Imperialists to open its gates; but\r\nthe commandant replied, “When the town of Metz has been taken, when I\r\nhave had the honor of being besieged in due form by the emperor, and when\r\nI have made as long a defence as the Duke of Guise has, such a summons\r\nmay be addressed to me, and I will consider what I am to do.”  On the\r\n26th of December, 1552, the sixty-fifth day since the arrival of the\r\nimperial army and the forty-fifth since the batteries had opened fire,\r\nCharles V. resolved to raise the siege.  “I see very well,” said he,\r\n“that fortune resembles women; she prefers a young king to an old\r\nemperor.”  His army filed off by night, in silence, leaving behind its\r\nmunitions and its tents just as they stood, “driven away, almost, by the\r\nchastisement of Heaven,” says the contemporary chronicler Rabutin, “with\r\nbut two shots by way of signal.”  The ditty of the soldier just quoted\r\nends thus:--\r\n\r\n“At last, so stout was her defence,\r\nFrom Metz they moved their guns away;\r\nAnd, with the laugh at their expense,\r\nA-tramping went their whole array.\r\nAnd at their tail the noble Lord\r\nOf Guise sent forth a goodly throng\r\nOf cavalry, with lance and sword,\r\nTo teach them how to tramp along.”\r\n\r\nGuise was far from expecting so sudden and decisive a result.  “Sing me\r\nno more flattering strains in your letters about the emperor’s\r\ndislodgment hence,” he wrote on the 24th of December to his brother the\r\nCardinal of Lorraine; “take it for certain that unless we be very much\r\nmistaken in him, he will not, as long as he has life, brook the shame of\r\ndeparting hence until he has seen it all out.”\r\n\r\nIrritated, and, perhaps, still more shocked, at so heavy a blow to his\r\npower and his renown, Charles V. looked everywhere for a chance of taking\r\nhis revenge.  He flattered himself that he had found it in Therouanne,\r\na fortress of importance at that time between Flanders and Artois, which\r\nhad always been a dependency of the kingdom of France, and served as a\r\nrampart against the repeated incursions of the English, the masters of\r\nCalais.  Charles knew that it was ill supplied with troops and munitions\r\nof war; and the court of Henry II., intoxicated with the deliverance of\r\nMetz, spoke disdainfully of the emperor, and paid no heed to anything but\r\nballs, festivities, and tournaments in honor of the marriage between\r\nDiana d’Angouleme, the king’s natural daughter, and Horatio Farnese, Duke\r\nof Castro.  All on a sudden it was announced that the troops of Charles\r\nV. were besieging Therouanne.  The news was at first treated lightly; it\r\nwas thought sufficient to send to Therouanne some re-enforcements under\r\nthe orders of Francis de Montmorency, nephew of the constable; but the\r\nattack was repulsed with spirit by the besiegers, and brave as was the\r\nresistance offered by the besieged, who sustained for ten hours a\r\nsanguinary assault, on the 20th of June, 1553, Francis de Montmorency saw\r\nthe impossibility of holding out longer, and, on the advice of all his\r\nofficers, offered to surrender the place; but he forgot to stipulate in\r\nthe first place for a truce; the Germans entered the town, thrown open\r\nwithout terms of capitulation; it was given up as prey to an army itself\r\na prey to all the passions of soldiers as well as to their master’s\r\nvengeful feelings, and Therouanne, handed over for devastation, was for a\r\nwhole month diligently demolished and razed to the ground.  When Charles\r\nV., at Brussels, received news of the capture, “bonfires were lighted\r\nthroughout Flanders; bells were rung, cannon were fired.”  It was but a\r\npoor revenge for so great a sovereign after the reverse he had just met\r\nwith at Metz; but the fall of Therouanne was a grievous incident for\r\nFrance.  Francis I. was in the habit of saying that Therouanne in\r\nFlanders and Acqs (now Dax) on the frontier of Guienne were, to him, like\r\ntwo pillows on which he could rest tranquilly.  [_Histoire universelle,_\r\nt. ii.  p. 352.]\r\n\r\nWhilst these events were passing in Lorraine and Flanders, Henry II. and\r\nhis advisers were obstinately persisting in the bad policy which had been\r\nclung to by Charles VIII., Louis XII., and Francis I., that, in fact, of\r\nmaking conquests and holding possessions in Italy.  War continued, from\r\nTurin to Naples, between France, the emperor, the pope, and the local\r\nprinces, with all sorts of alliances and alternations, but with no\r\ntangible result.  Blaise de Montluc defended the fortress of Sienna for\r\nnine months against the Imperialists with an intelligence and a bravery\r\nwhich earned for him twenty years later the title of Marshal of France.\r\nCharles de Brissac was carrying on the war in Piedmont with such a\r\ncombination of valor and generosity that the king sent him as a present\r\nhis own sword, writing to him at the same time, “The opinion I have of\r\nyour merit has become rooted even amongst foreigners.  The emperor says\r\nthat he would make himself monarch of the whole world if he had a Brissac\r\nto second his plans.”  His men, irritated at getting no pay, one day\r\nsurrounded Brissac, complaining vehemently.  “You will always get bread\r\nby coming to me,” said he; and he paid the debt of France by sacrificing\r\nhis daughter’s dowry and borrowing a heavy sum from the Swiss on the\r\nsecurity of his private fortune.  It was by such devotion and such\r\nsacrifices that the French nobility paid for and justified their\r\npreponderance in the state; but they did not manage to succeed in the\r\nconduct of public affairs, and to satisfy the interests of a nation\r\nprogressing in activity, riches, independence, and influence.  Disquieted\r\nat the smallness of his success in Italy, Henry II. flattered himself\r\nthat he would regain his ascendency there by sending thither the Duke of\r\nGuise, the hero of Metz, with an army of about twenty thousand men,\r\nFrench or Swiss, and a staff of experienced officers; but Guise was not\r\nmore successful than his predecessors had been.  After several attempts\r\nby arms and negotiation amongst the local sovereigns, he met with a\r\ndistinct failure in the kingdom of Naples before the fortress of\r\nCivitella, the siege of which he was forced to raise on the 15th of May,\r\n1557.  Wearied out by want of success, sick in the midst of an army of\r\nsick, regretting over “the pleasure of his field-sports at Joinville, and\r\nbegging his mother to have just a word or two written to him to console\r\nhim,” all he sighed for was to get back to France.  And it was not long\r\nbefore the state of affairs recalled him thither.  It was now nearly two\r\nyears ago that, on the 25th of October, 1555, and the 1st of January,\r\n1556, Charles V.  had solemnly abdicated all his dominions, giving over\r\nto his son Philip the kingdom of Spain, with the sovereignty of Burgundy\r\nand the Low Countries, and to his younger brother, Ferdinand, the empire\r\ntogether with the original heritage of the House of Austria, and retiring\r\npersonally to the monastery of Yuste, in Estramadura, there to pass the\r\nlast years of his life, distracted with gout, at one time resting from\r\nthe world and its turmoil, at another vexing himself about what was doing\r\nthere now that he was no longer in it.  Before abandoning it for good, he\r\ndesired to do his son Philip the service of leaving him, if not in a\r\nstate of definite peace, at any rate in a condition of truce with France.\r\nHenry II. also desired rest; and the Constable de Montmorency wished\r\nabove everything for the release of his son Francis, who had been a\r\nprisoner since the fall of Thorouanne.  A truce for five years was signed\r\nat Vaucelles on the 5th of February, 1556; and Coligny, quite young\r\nstill, but already admiral and in high esteem, had the conduct of the\r\nnegotiation.  He found Charles V. dressed in mourning, seated beside a\r\nlittle table, in a modest apartment hung with black.  When the admiral\r\nhanded to the emperor the king’s letter, Charles could not himself break\r\nthe seal, and the Bishop of Arras drew near to render him that service.\r\n“Gently, my Lord of Arras,” said the emperor; “would you rob me of the\r\nduty I am bound to discharge towards the king my brother-in-law?  Please\r\nGod, none but I shall do it;” and then turning to Coligny, he said, “What\r\nwill you say of me, admiral?  Am I not a pretty knight to run a course\r\nand break a lance, I who can only with great difficulty open a letter?”\r\n He inquired with an air of interest after Henry II.’s health, and boasted\r\nof belonging himself, also, to the house of France through his\r\ngrandmother Mary of Burgundy.  “I hold it to be an honor,” said he, “to\r\nhave issued, on the mother’s side, from the stock which wears and upholds\r\nthe most famous crown in the world.”  His son Philip, who was but a\r\nnovice in kingly greatness, showed less courtesy and less good taste than\r\nhis father; he received the French ambassadors in a room hung with\r\npictures representing the battle of Pavia.  There were some who concluded\r\nfrom that that the truce would not be of long duration.  [_Histoire\r\nd’Espagne,_ by M. Rosseeuw Saint-Hilaire, t. viii.  p. 64.]\r\n\r\nAnd it was not long before their prognostication was verified.  The\r\nsending of the Duke of Guise into Italy, and the assistance he brought to\r\nPope Paul IV., then at war with the new King of Spain, Philip II., were\r\nconsidered as a violation of the truce of Vaucelles.  Henry II. had\r\nexpected as much, and had ordered Coligny, who was commanding in Picardy\r\nand Flanders, to hold himself in readiness to take the field as soon as\r\nhe should be, if not forced, at any rate naturally called upon, by any\r\nunforeseen event.  It cost Coligny, who was a man of scrupulous honor, a\r\ngreat struggle to lightly break a truce he had just signed; nevertheless,\r\nin January, 1557, when he heard that the French were engaged in Italy in\r\nthe war between the pope and the Spaniards, he did not consider that he\r\ncould possibly remain inactive in Flanders.  He took by surprise the town\r\nof Lens, between Lille and Arras.  Philip II., on his side, had taken\r\nmeasures for promptly entering upon the campaign.  By his marriage with\r\nMary Tudor, Queen of England, he had secured for himself a powerful ally\r\nin the north; the English Parliament were but little disposed to\r\ncompromise themselves in a war with France; but in March, 1557, Philip\r\nwent to London; the queen’s influence and the distrust excited in England\r\nby Henry II. prevailed over the pacific desires of the nation; and Mary\r\nsent a simple herald to carry to the King of France at Rheims her\r\ndeclaration of war.  Henry accepted it politely, but resolutely.\r\n“I speak to you in this way,” said he to the herald, “because it is a\r\nqueen who sends you; had it been a king, I would speak to you in a very\r\ndifferent tone;” and he ordered him to be gone forthwith from the\r\nkingdom.  A negotiation was commenced for accomplishing the marriage,\r\nlong since agreed upon, between the young Queen of Scotland, Mary Stuart,\r\nand Henry II.’s son, Francis, dauphin of France.  Mary, who was born on\r\nthe 8th of December, 1542, at Falkland Castle in Scotland, had, since\r\n1548, lived and received her education at the court of France, whither\r\nher mother, Mary of Lorraine, eldest sister of Francis of Guise and\r\nqueen-dowager of Scotland, had lost no time in sending her as soon as the\r\nfuture union between the two children had been agreed upon between the\r\ntwo courts.  The dauphin of France was a year younger than the Scottish\r\nprincess; but “from his childhood,” says the Venetian Capello, “he has\r\nbeen very much in love with her Most Serene little Highness the Queen of\r\nScotland, who is destined for his wife.  It sometimes happens that, when\r\nthey are exchanging endearments, they like to retire quite apart into a\r\ncorner of the rooms, that their little secrets may not be overheard.”  On\r\nthe 19th of April, 1558, the espousals took place in the great hall of\r\nthe Louvre, and the marriage was celebrated in the church of Notre-Dame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Francis II. and Mary Stuart love making----251]\r\n\r\nFrom that time Mary Stuart was styled in France queen-dauphiness, and her\r\nhusband, with the authorization of the Scottish commissioners, took the\r\ntitle of king-dauphin.  “Etiquette required at that time that the heir to\r\nthe throne should hold his court separately, and not appear at the king’s\r\ncourt save on grand occasions.  The young couple resigned themselves\r\nwithout any difficulty to this exile, and retired to Villers-Cotterets.”\r\n [_Histoire de Marie Stuart,_ by Jules Gauthier, t. i.  p. 36.]\r\n\r\nWhilst preparations were being made at Paris for the rejoicings in honor\r\nof the union of the two royal children, war broke out in Picardy and\r\nFlanders.  Philip II. had landed there with an army of forty-seven\r\nthousand men, of whom seven thousand were English.  Never did any great\r\nsovereign and great politician provoke and maintain for long such\r\nimportant wars without conducting them in some other fashion than from\r\nthe recesses of his cabinet, and without ever having exposed his own life\r\non the field of battle.  The Spanish army was under the orders of\r\nEmmanuel-Philibert, Duke of Savoy, a young warrior of thirty, who had won\r\nthe confidence of Charles V.  He led it to the siege of Saint-Quentin,\r\na place considered as one of the bulwarks of the kingdom.  Philip II.\r\nremained at some leagues’ distance in the environs.  Henry II. was ill\r\nprepared for so serious an attack; his army, which was scarcely twenty\r\nthousand strong, mustered near Laon under the orders of the Duke of\r\nNevers, governor of Champagne; at the end of July, 1557, it hurried into\r\nPicardy, under the command of the Constable de Montmorency, who was\r\nsupported by Admiral de Coligny, his nephew, by the Duke of Enghien, by\r\nthe Prince of Condo, and by the Duke of Montpensier, by nearly all the\r\ngreat lords and valiant warriors of France; they soon saw that Saint-\r\nQuentin was in a deplorable state of defence; the fortifications were old\r\nand badly kept up; soldiers, munitions of war, and victuals were all\r\nequally deficient.  Coligny did not hesitate, however he threw himself\r\ninto the place on the 2d of August, during the night, with a small corps\r\nof seven hundred men and Saint-Remy, a skilful engineer, who had already\r\ndistinguished himself in the defence of Metz; the admiral packed off the\r\nuseless mouths, repaired the walls at the points principally threatened,\r\nand reanimated the failing courage of the inhabitants.  The constable and\r\nhis army came within hail of the place; and D’Andelot, Coligny’s brother,\r\nmanaged with great difficulty to get four hundred and fifty men into it.\r\nOn the 10th of August the battle was begun between the two armies.  The\r\nconstable affected to despise the Duke of Savoy’s youth.  “I will soon\r\nshow him,” said he, “a move of an old soldier.”  The French army, very\r\ninferior in numbers, was for a moment on the point of being surrounded.\r\nThe Prince of Conde sent the constable warning.  “I was serving in the\r\nfield,” answered Montmorency, “before the Prince of Conde came into the\r\nworld; I have good hopes of still giving him lessons in the art of war\r\nfor some years to come.”  The valor of the constable and his comrades in\r\narms could not save them from the consequences of their stubborn\r\nrecklessness and their numerical inferiority; the battalions of Gascon\r\ninfantry closed their ranks, with pikes to the front, and made an heroic\r\nresistance, but all in vain, against repeated charges of the Spanish\r\ncavalry: and the defeat was total.  More than three thousand men were\r\nkilled; the number of prisoners amounted to double; and the constable,\r\nleft upon the field with his thigh shattered by a cannon-ball, fell into\r\nthe hands of the Spaniards, as was also the case with the Dukes of\r\nLongueville and Montpensier, La Rochefoucauld, D’Aubigne, &c.  .  .  .\r\nThe Duke of Enghien, Viscount de Turenne, and a multitude of others, many\r\ngreat names amidst a host of obscure, fell in the fight.  The Duke of\r\nNevers and the Prince of Conde, sword in hand, reached La Fere with the\r\nremnants of their army.  Coligny remained alone in Saint-Quentin with\r\nthose who survived of his little garrison, and a hundred and twenty\r\narquebusiers whom the Duke of Nevers threw into the place at a loss of\r\nthree times as many.  Coligny held out for a fortnight longer, behind\r\nwalls that were in ruins and were assailed by a victorious army.  At\r\nlength, on the 27th of August, the enemy entered Saint-Quentin by shoals.\r\n“The admiral, who was still going about the streets with a few men to\r\nmake head against them, found himself hemmed in on all sides, and did all\r\nhe could to fall into the hands of a Spaniard, preferring rather to await\r\non the spot the common fate than to incur by flight any shame and\r\nreproach.  He who took him prisoner, after having set him to rest a while\r\nat the foot of the ramparts, took him away to their camp, where, as he\r\nentered, he met Captain Alonzo de Cazieres, commandant of the old bands\r\nof Spanish infantry, when up came the Duke of Savoy, who ordered the said\r\nCazieres to take the admiral to his tent.”  [_Commentaire de Francois de\r\nRabutin sur les Guerres entre Henri II., roi de France, et Charles Quint,\r\nempereur,_ t. ii.  p. 95, in the _Petitot collection_.]  D’Andelot, the\r\nadmiral’s brother, succeeded in escaping across the marshes.  Being thus\r\nmaster of Saint-Quentin, Philip II., after having attempted to put a stop\r\nto carnage and plunder, expelled from the town, which was half in ashes,\r\nthe inhabitants who had survived; and the small adjacent fortresses, Ham\r\nand Catelet, were not long before they surrendered.\r\n\r\nPhilip, with anxious modesty, sent information of his victory to his\r\nfather, Charles, who had been in retirement since February 21, 1556, at\r\nthe monastery of Yuste.  “As I did not happen to be there myself,” he\r\nsaid at the end of his letter, “about which I am heavy at heart as to\r\nwhat your Majesty will possibly think, I can only tell you from hearsay\r\nwhat took place.”  We have not the reply of Charles V. to his son; but\r\nhis close confidant, Quejada, wrote, “The emperor felt at this news one\r\nof the greatest thrills of satisfaction he has ever had; but, to tell you\r\nthe truth, I perceive by his manner that he cannot reconcile himself to\r\nthe thought that his son was not there; and with good reason.”  After\r\nthat Saint-Quentin had surrendered, the Duke of Savoy wanted to march\r\nforward and strike affrighted France to the very heart; and the aged\r\nemperor was of his mind.  “Is the king my son at Paris?” he said, when he\r\nheard of his victory.  Philip had thought differently about it instead of\r\nhurling his army on Paris, he had moved it back to Saint-Quentin, and\r\nkept it for the reduction of places in the neighborhood.  “The\r\nSpaniards,” says Rabutin, “might have accomplished our total\r\nextermination, and taken from us all hope of setting ourselves up again.\r\n.  .  .  But the Supreme Ruler, the God of victories, pulled them up\r\nquite short.”  An unlooked-for personage, Queen Catherine de’ Medici,\r\nthen for the first time entered actively upon the scene.  We borrow the\r\nvery words of the Venetian ambassadors who lived within her sphere.  The\r\nfirst, Lorenzo Contarini, wrote in 1552, “The queen is younger than the\r\nking, but only thirteen days; she is not pretty, but she is possessed of\r\nextraordinary wisdom and prudence; no doubt of her being fit to govern;\r\nnevertheless she is not consulted or considered so much as she well might\r\nbe.”  Five years later, in 1557, after the battle and capture of\r\nSaint-Quentin, France was in a fit of stupor; Paris believed the enemy\r\nto be already beneath her walls; many of the burgesses were packing up\r\nand flying, some to Orleans, some to Bourges, some still farther.  The\r\nking had gone to Compiegne “to get together,” says Brantome, “a fresh\r\narmy.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Catherine de’ Medici (in her young days)----255]\r\n\r\nQueen Catherine was alone at Paris.  Of her own motion “she went to the\r\nParliament (according to the _Memoires de la Chatre_ it was to the Hotel\r\nde Ville that she went and made her address) in full state, accompanied\r\nby the cardinals, princes, and princesses; and there, in the most\r\nimpressive language, she set forth the urgent state of affairs at the\r\nmoment.  She pointed out that, in spite of the enormous expenses into\r\nwhich the Most Christian king had found himself drawn in his late wars,\r\nhe had shown the greatest care not to burden the towns.  In the\r\ncontinuous and extreme pressure of requirements her Majesty did not think\r\nthat any further charge could be made on the people of the country\r\nplaces, who in ordinary times always bear the greatest burden.  With so\r\nmuch sentiment and eloquence that she touched the heart of everybody, the\r\nqueen then explained to the Parliament that the king had need of three\r\nhundred thousand livres, twenty-five thousand to be paid every two\r\nmonths; and she added that she would retire from the place of session, so\r\nas not to interfere with liberty of discussion; and she, accordingly,\r\nretired to an adjoining room.  A resolution to comply with the wishes of\r\nher Majesty was voted, and the queen, having resumed her place, received\r\na promise to that effect.  A hundred notables of the city offered to give\r\nat once three thousand francs apiece.  The queen thanked them in the\r\nsweetest form of words; and thus terminated this session of Parliament\r\nwith so much applause for her Majesty and such lively marks of\r\nsatisfaction at her behavior that no idea can be given of them.\r\nThroughout the whole city nothing was spoken of but the queen’s prudence\r\nand the happy manner in which she proceeded in this enterprise.”\r\n\r\nSuch is the account, not of a French courtier, but of the Venetian\r\nambassador, Giacomo Lorenzo, writing confidentially to his government.\r\nFrom that day the position of Catherine de’ Medici was changed in France,\r\namongst the people as well as at court.  “The king went more often to see\r\nher; he added to his habits that of holding court at her apartments for\r\nabout an hour every day after supper in the midst of the lords and\r\nladies.”  It is not to be discovered anywhere in the contemporary\r\nMemoires, whether Catherine had anything to do with the resolution taken\r\nby Henry II. on returning from Compiegne; but she thenceforward assumed\r\nher place, and gave a foretaste of the part she was to play in the\r\ngovernment of France.  Unhappily for the honor of Catherine and for the\r\nwelfare of France, that part soon ceased to be judicious, dignified, and\r\nsalutary, as it had been on that day of its first exhibition.\r\n\r\nOn entering Paris again the king at once sent orders to the Duke of Guise\r\nto return in haste from Italy with all the troops he could bring.  Every\r\neye and every hope were fixed upon the able and heroic defender of Metz,\r\nwho had forced Charles V. to retreat before him.  A general appeal was at\r\nthe same time addressed to “all soldiers, gentlemen and others, who had\r\nborne or were capable of bearing arms, to muster at Laon under the Duke\r\nof Nevers, in order to be employed for the service of the king and for\r\nthe tuition [protection] of their country, their families, and their\r\nproperty.”  Guise arrived on the 20th of October, 1557, at\r\nSaint-Germain-en-Laye, where the court happened to be just then: every\r\nmark of favor was lavished upon him; all the resources of the state were\r\nput at his disposal; there was even some talk of appointing him viceroy;\r\nbut Henry II. confined himself to proclaiming him, on the very day of\r\nhis arrival, lieutenant-general of the armies throughout the whole\r\nextent of the monarchy, both within and without the realm.  His brother,\r\nthe Cardinal of Lorraine, who was as ambitious and almost as able as he,\r\nhad the chief direction in civil, financial, and diplomatic affairs;\r\nnever, since the great mayors-of-the-palace under the Merovingian kings,\r\nhad similar power been in the hands of a subject.  Like a man born to\r\ncommand, Guise saw that, in so complicated a situation, a brilliant\r\nstroke must be accomplished and a great peril be met by a great success.\r\n“He racked his brains for all sorts of devices for enabling him to do\r\nsome remarkable deed which might humble the pride of that haughty\r\nSpanish nation and revive the courage of his own men; and he took it\r\nthat those things which the enemy considered as the most secure would be\r\nthe least carefully guarded.  Some years previously it had been\r\nsuggested to the constable that an attempt might be made upon Calais,\r\nnegligently guarded as it was, and the place itself not being in good\r\norder.  The Duke of Guise put the idea of this enterprise forward once\r\nmore, and begged the king’s permission to attempt it, without saying a\r\nword about it to anybody else, which the king considered to be a very\r\ngood notion.”  Guise took the command of the army, and made a feint of\r\ndirecting its movements towards an expedition in the east of the\r\nkingdom; but, suddenly turning westwards, he found himself on the night\r\nof January 1, 1558, beneath the walls of Calais, “whither, with right\r\ngood will, all the princes, lords, and soldiers had marched.”  On the 3d\r\nof January he took the two forts of Nieullay and Risbank, which covered\r\nthe approaches to the place.  On the 4th he prepared for, and on the 6th\r\nhe delivered, the assault upon the citadel itself, which was carried; he\r\nleft there his brother, the Duke of Aumale, with a sufficient force for\r\ndefence; the portion of the English garrison which had escaped at the\r\nassault fell back within the town; the governor, Lord Wentworth, “like a\r\nman in desperation, who saw he was all but lost,” made vain attempts to\r\nrecover this important post under cover of night and of the high sea,\r\nwhich rendered impossible the prompt arrival of any aid for the French;\r\nbut “they held their own inside the castle.”  The English requested the\r\nDuke of Aumale “to parley so as to come to some honorable and reasonable\r\nterms;” and Guise assented.  On the 8th of January, whilst he was\r\nconferring in his tent with the representatives of the governor,\r\nColigny’s brother, D’Andelot, entered the town at the solicitation of\r\nthe English themselves, who were afraid of being all put to the sword.\r\nThe capitulation was signed.  The inhabitants, with their wives and\r\nchildren, had their lives spared, and received permission to leave\r\nCalais freely and without any insult, and withdraw to England or\r\nFlanders.  Lord Wentworth and fifty other persons, to be chosen by the\r\nDuke of Guise, remained prisoners of war; with this exception, all the\r\nsoldiers were to return to England, but with empty hands.  The place was\r\nleft with all the cannons, arms, munitions, utensils, engines of war,\r\nflags and standards which happened to be in it. The furniture, the gold\r\nand silver, coined or other, the merchandise, and the horses passed over\r\nto the disposal of the Duke of Guise.  Lastly the vanquished, when they\r\nquitted the town, were to leave it intact, having no power to pull down\r\nhouses, unpave streets, throw up earth, displace a single stone, pull\r\nout a single nail.  The conqueror’s precautions were as deliberate as\r\nhis audacity had been sudden.  On the 9th of January, 1558, after a\r\nweek’s siege, Calais, which had been in the hands of the English for two\r\nhundred and ten years, once more became a French town, in spite of the\r\ninscription which was engraved on one of its gates, and which may be\r\nturned into the following distich:--\r\n\r\n              “A siege of Calais may seem good\r\n               When lead and iron swim like wood.”\r\n\r\nThe joy was so much the greater in that it was accompanied by great\r\nsurprise: save a few members of the king’s council, nobody expected this\r\nconquest.  “I certainly thought that you must be occupied in preparing\r\nfor some great exploit, and that you wished to wait until you could\r\napprise me of the execution rather than the design,” wrote Marshal de\r\nBrissac to the Duke of Guise, on the 22d of January, from Italy.\r\nForeigners were not less surprised than the French themselves; they had\r\nsupposed that France would remain for a long while under the effects of\r\nthe reverse experienced at Saint-Quentin.  “The loss of Calais,” said\r\nPope Paul IV., “will be the only dowry that the Queen of England will\r\nobtain from her marriage with Philip.  For France such a conquest is\r\npreferable to that of half the kingdom of England.”  When Mary Tudor,\r\nalready seriously ill, heard the news, she exclaimed from her deathbed,\r\non the 20th of January, “If my heart is opened, there will be found\r\ngraven upon it the word Calais.”  And when the Grand Prior of France, on\r\nrepairing to the court of his sister, Mary of Lorraine, in Scotland, went\r\nto visit Queen Elizabeth, who had succeeded Mary Tudor, she, after she\r\nhad made him dance several times with her, said to him, “My dear prior, I\r\nlike you very much, but not your brother, who robbed me of my town of\r\nCalais.”\r\n\r\nGuise was one of those who knew that it is as necessary to follow up a\r\nsuccess accomplished as to proceed noiselessly in the execution of a\r\nsudden success.  When he was master of Calais he moved rapidly upon the\r\nneighboring fortresses of Guines and Ham; and he had them in his power\r\nwithin a few days, notwithstanding a resistance more stout than he had\r\nencountered at Calais.  During the same time the Duke of Nevers,\r\nencouraged by such examples, also took the field again, and gained\r\npossession, in Champagne and the neighborhood, of the strong castles of\r\nHerbemont, Jamoigne, Chigny, Rossignol, and Villemont.  Guise had no idea\r\nof contenting himself with his successes in the west of France; his\r\nambition carried him into the east also, to the environs of Metz, the\r\nscene of his earliest glory.  He heard that Vieilleville, who had become\r\ngovernor of Metz, was setting about the reduction of Thionville, “the\r\nbest picture of a fortress I ever saw,” says Montluc.  “I have heard,”\r\n wrote Guise to Vieilleville, “that you have a fine enterprise on hand; I\r\npray you do not commence the execution of it, in any fashion whatever,\r\nuntil I be with you: having given a good account of Calais and Guines, as\r\nlieutenant-general of his Majesty in this realm, I should be very vexed\r\nif there should be done therein anything of honor and importance without\r\nmy presence.”  He arrived before Thionville on the 4th of June, 1558.\r\nVieilleville and his officers were much put out at his interference.\r\n“The duke might surely have dispensed with coming,” said D’Estrees, chief\r\nofficer of artillery; “it will be easy for him to swallow what is all\r\nchewed ready for him.”  But the bulk of the army did not share this\r\nfeeling of jealousy.  When the pioneers, drawn up, caught sight of Guise,\r\n“Come on, sir,” they cried, “come and let us die before Thionville; we\r\nhave been expecting you this long while.”  The siege lasted three weeks\r\nlonger.  Guise had with him two comrades of distinction, the Italian\r\nPeter Strozzi, and the Gascon Blaise do Montluc.  On the 20th of June\r\nStrozzi was mortally wounded by an arquebuse-shot, at the very side of\r\nGuise, who was talking to him with a hand upon his shoulder.  “Ah! by\r\nGod’s head, sir,” cried Strozzi, in Italian, “the king to-day loses a\r\ngood servant, and so does your excellency.”  Guise, greatly moved,\r\nattempted to comfort him, and spoke to him the name of Jesus Christ; but\r\nStrozzi was one of those infidels so common at that time in Italy.\r\n“‘Sdeath,” said he, “what Jesus are you come hither to remind me of?\r\nI believe in no God; my game is played.”  “You will appear to-day before\r\nHis face,” persisted Guise, in the earnestness of his faith.  “‘Sdeath,”\r\n replied Strozzi, “I shall be where all the others are who have died in\r\nthe last six thousand years.”  The eyes of Guise remained fixed a while\r\nupon his comrade dying in such a frame of mind; but he soon turned all\r\nhis thoughts once more to the siege of Thionville.  Montluc supported him\r\nvaliantly.  A strong tower still held out, and Montluc carried it at the\r\nhead of his men.  Guise rushed up and threw his arm round the warrior’s\r\nneck, saying, “Monseigneur, I now see clearly that the old proverb is\r\nquite infallible: ‘A good horse will go to the last.’ I am off at once to\r\nmy quarters to report the capture to the king.  Be assured that I shall\r\nnot conceal from him the service you have done.”  The reduction of\r\nThionville was accomplished on that very day, June 22, 1558.  That of\r\nArlon, a rich town in the neighborhood, followed very closely.  Guise,\r\nthoroughly worn out, had ordered the approaches to be made next morning\r\nat daybreak, requesting that he might be left to sleep until he awoke of\r\nhimself; when he did awake, he inquired whether the artillery had yet\r\nopened fire; he was told that Montluc had surprised the place during the\r\nnight.  “That is making the pace very fast,” said he, as he made the sign\r\nof the cross; but he did not care to complain about it.  Under the\r\nimpulse communicated by him the fortunes of France were reviving\r\neverywhere.  A check received before Gravelines, on the 13th of July,\r\n1558, by a division commanded by De Termes, governor of Calais, did not\r\nsubdue the national elation and its effect upon the enemy themselves.\r\n“It is an utter impossibility for me to keep up the war,” wrote Philip\r\nII., on the 15th of February, 1559, to Granvelle.  On both sides there\r\nwas a desire for peace; and conferences were opened at Cateau-Cambresis.\r\nOn the 6th of February, 1559, a convention was agreed upon for a truce\r\nwhich was to last during the whole course of the negotiation, and for six\r\ndays after the separation of the plenipotentiaries, in case no peace took\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nIt was concluded on the 2d of April, 1559, between Henry II. and\r\nElizabeth, who had become Queen of England at the death of her sister\r\nMary (November 17, 1558); and next day, April 3, between Henry II.,\r\nPhilip II., and the allied princes of Spain, amongst others the Prince of\r\nOrange, William the Silent, who, whilst serving in the Spanish army, was\r\nfitting himself to become the leader of the Reformers, and the liberator\r\nof the Low Countries.  By the treaty with England, France was to keep\r\nCalais for eight years in the first instance, and on a promise to pay\r\nfive hundred thousand gold crowns to Queen Elizabeth or her successors.\r\nThe money was never paid, and Calais was never restored, and this without\r\nthe English government’s having considered that it could make the matter\r\na motive for renewing the war.  By the treaty with Spain, France was to\r\nkeep Metz, Toul, and Verdun, and have back Saint-Quentin, Le Catelet, and\r\nHam; but she was to restore to Spain or her allies a hundred and\r\neighty-nine places in Flanders, Piedmont, Tuscany, and Corsica.  The\r\nmalcontents--for the absence of political liberty does not suppress\r\nthem entirely--raised their voices energetically against this last\r\ntreaty signed by the king, with the sole desire, it was supposed, of\r\nobtaining the liberation of his two favorites, the Constable de\r\nMontmorency and Marshal de Saint-Andre, who had been prisoners in Spain\r\nsince the defeat at Saint-Quentin.  “Their ransom,” it was said, “has\r\ncost the kingdom more than that of Francis I.”  Guise himself said to\r\nthe king, “A stroke of your Majesty’s pen costs more to France than\r\nthirty years of war cost.” Ever since that time the majority of\r\nhistorians, even the most enlightened, have joined in the censure that\r\nwas general in the sixteenth century; but their opinion will not be\r\nindorsed here; the places which France had won during the war, and which\r\nshe retained by the peace,--Metz, Toul, and Verdun on her frontier in\r\nthe north-east, facing the imperial or Spanish possessions, and Boulogne\r\nand Calais on her coasts in the north-west, facing England,--were, as\r\nregarded the integrity of the state and the security of the inhabitants,\r\nof infinitely more importance than those which she gave up in Flanders\r\nand Italy.  The treaty of Cateau-Cambresis, too, marked the termination\r\nof those wars of ambition and conquest which the Kings of France had\r\nwaged beyond the Alps an injudicious policy, which, for four reigns, had\r\ncrippled and wasted the resources of France in adventurous expeditions,\r\nbeyond the limits of her geographical position and her natural and\r\npermanent interests.\r\n\r\nMore or less happily, the treaty of Cateau-Cambreis had regulated all\r\nthose questions of external policy which were burdensome to France; she\r\nwas once more at peace with her neighbors, and seemed to have nothing\r\nmore to do than to gather in the fruits thereof.  But she had in her own\r\nmidst questions far more difficult of solution than those of her external\r\npolicy, and these perils from within were threatening her more seriously\r\nthan any from without.  Since the death of Francis I., the religious\r\nferment had pursued its course, becoming more general and more fierce;\r\nthe creed of the Reformers had spread very much; their number had very\r\nmuch increased; permanent churches, professing and submitting to a fixed\r\nfaith and discipline, had been founded; that of Paris was the first, in\r\n1555; and the example had been followed at Orleans, at Chartres, at\r\nLyons, at Toulouse, at Rochelle, in Normandy, in Touraine, in Guienne, in\r\nPoitou, in Dauphiny, in Provence, and in all the provinces, more or less.\r\nIn 1561, it was calculated that there were twenty-one hundred and fifty\r\nreformed, or, as the expression then was, rectified (dressees), churches.\r\n“And this is no fanciful figure; it is the result of a census taken at\r\nthe instigation of the deputies who represented the reformed churches at\r\nthe conference of Poissy on the demand of Catherine de’ Medici, and in\r\nconformity with the advice of Admiral de Coligny.”  [_La Reformation en\r\nFrance pendant sa premiere periode,_ by Henri Luttheroth, pp. 127-132.]\r\nIt is clear that the movement of the Reformation in the sixteenth century\r\nwas one of those spontaneous and powerful movements which have their\r\nsource and derive their strength from the condition of men’s souls and\r\nof whole communities, and not merely from the personal ambitions and\r\ninterests which soon come and mingle with them, whether it be to promote\r\nor to retard them.  One thing has been already here stated and confirmed\r\nby facts; it was specially in France that the Reformation had this truly\r\nreligious and sincere character; very far from supporting or tolerating\r\nit, the sovereign and public authorities opposed it from its very birth;\r\nunder Francis I. it had met with no real defenders but its martyrs; and\r\nit was still the same under Henry II.  During the reign of Francis I.,\r\nwithin a space of twenty-three years, there had been eighty-one capital\r\nexecutions for heresy; during that of Henry II., twelve years, there were\r\nninety-seven for the same cause, and at one of these executions Henry II.\r\nwas present in person, on the space in front of Notre-Dame: a spectacle\r\nwhich Francis I. had always refused to see.  In 1551, 1557, and 1559,\r\nHenry II., by three royal edicts, kept up and added to all the\r\nprohibitions and penalties in force against the Reformers.  In 1550, the\r\nmassacre of the Vaudians was still in such lively and odious remembrance\r\nthat a noble lady of Provence, Madame de Cental, did not hesitate to\r\npresent a complaint, in the name of her despoiled, proscribed, and\r\nmurdered vassals, against the Cardinal de Tournon, the Count de Grignan,\r\nand the Premier President Maynier d’Oppede, as having abused, for the\r\npurpose of getting authority for this massacre, the religious feelings of\r\nthe king, who on his death-bed had testified his remorse for it.  “This\r\ncause,” says De Thou, “was pleaded with much warmth, and occupied fifty\r\naudiences, with a large concourse of people, but the judgment took all\r\nthe world by surprise.  Guerin alone, advocate-general in 1545, having no\r\nsupport at court, was condemned to death, and was scape-goat for all the\r\nrest.  D’Oppede defended himself with fanatical pride, saying that he\r\nonly executed the king’s orders, like Saul, whom God commanded to\r\nexterminate the Amalekites.  He had the Duke of Guise to protect him; and\r\nhe was sent back to discharge the duties of his office.  Such was the\r\nprejudice of the Parliament of Paris against the Reformers that it\r\ninterdicted the hedge-schools (_ecoles buissonnieres_), schools which the\r\nProtestants held out in the country to escape from the jurisdiction of\r\nthe precentor of Notre-Dame de Paris, who had the sole supervision of\r\nprimary schools.  Hence comes the proverb, to play truant (_faire l’ecole\r\nbuissonniere--to go to hedge school_).  All the resources of French civil\r\njurisdiction appeared to be insufficient against the Reformers.  Henry\r\nII. asked the pope for a bull, transplanting into France the Spanish\r\nInquisition, the only real means of extirpating the root of the errors.”\r\n It was the characteristic of this Inquisition, that it was completely in\r\nthe hands of the clergy, and that its arm was long enough to reach the\r\nlay and the clerical indifferently.  Pope Paul IV. readily gave the king,\r\nin April, 1557, the bull he asked for, but the Parliament of Paris\r\nrefused to enregister the royal edict which gave force in France to the\r\npontifical brief.  In 1559 the pope replied to this refusal by a bull\r\nwhich comprised in one and the same anathema all heretics, though they\r\nmight be kings or emperors, and declared them to have “forfeited their\r\nbenefices, states, kingdoms, or empires, the which should devolve on the\r\nfirst to seize them, without power on the part of the Holy See itself to\r\nrestore them.”  [_Magnum Bullarium Romanum, a Beato Leone Magno ad\r\nPaulum IV.,_ t. i.  p. 841: Luxembourg, 1742.] The Parliament would not\r\nconsent to enregister the decree unless there were put in it a condition\r\nto the effect that clerics alone should be liable to the inquisition, and\r\nthat the judges should be taken from amongst the clergy of France.  For\r\nall their passionate opposition to the Reformation, the Magistrates had\r\nno idea of allowing either the kingship or France to fall beneath the\r\nyoke of the papacy.\r\n\r\nAmidst all these disagreements and distractions in the very heart of\r\nCatholicism, the Reformation went on growing from day to day.  In 1558,\r\nLorenzo, the Venetian ambassador, set down even then the number of the\r\nReformers at four hundred thousand.  In 1559, at the death of Henry II.,\r\nClaude Haton, a priest and contemporary chronicler on the Catholic side,\r\ncalculated that they were nearly a quarter of the population of France.\r\nThey held at Paris, in May, 1559, their first general synod; and eleven\r\nfully established churches sent deputies to it.  This synod drew up a\r\nform of faith called the Gallican Confession, and likewise a form of\r\ndiscipline.  “The burgess-class, for a long while so indifferent to the\r\nburnings that took place, were astounded at last at the constancy with\r\nwhich the pile was mounted by all those men and all those women who had\r\nnothing to do but to recant in order to save their lives.  Some could not\r\npersuade themselves that people so determined were not in the right;\r\nothers were moved with compassion.  ‘Their very hearts,’ say\r\ncontemporaries, ‘wept together with their eyes.’”  It needed only an\r\nopportunity to bring these feelings out.  Some of the faithful one day in\r\nthe month of May, 1558, on the public walk in the Pre-aux-Clercs, began\r\nto sing the psalms of Marot.  Their singing had been forbidden by the\r\nParliament of Bordeaux, but the practice of singing those psalms had but\r\nlately been so general that it could not be looked upon as peculiar to\r\nheretics.  All who happened to be there, suddenly animated by one and the\r\nsame feeling, joined in with the singers, as if to protest against the\r\npunishments which were being repeated day after day.  This manifestation\r\nwas renewed on the following days.  The King of Navarre, Anthony de\r\nBourbon, Prince Louis de Conde, his brother, and many lords took part in\r\nit together with a crowd, it is said, of five or six thousand persons.\r\nIt was not in the Pre-aux-Clercs only and by singing that this new state\r\nof mind revealed itself amongst the highest classes as well as amongst\r\nthe populace.  The Queen of Navarre, Jeanne d’Albret, in her early youth,\r\n“was as fond of a ball as of a sermon,” says Brantome, “and she had\r\nadvised her spouse, Anthony de Bourbon, who inclined towards Calvinism,\r\nnot to perplex himself with all these opinions.”  In 1559 she was\r\npassionately devoted to the faith and the cause of the Reformation.  With\r\nmore levity, but still in sincerity, her brother-in-law, Louis de Conde,\r\nput his ambition and his courage at the service of the same cause.\r\nAdmiral de Coligny’s youngest brother, Francis d’Andelot, declared\r\nhimself a Reformer to Henry II. himself, who, in his wrath, threw a plate\r\nat his head, and sent him to prison in the castle of Melun.  Coligny\r\nhimself, who had never disguised the favorable sentiments he felt towards\r\nthe Reformers, openly sided with them on the ground of his own personal\r\nfaith, as well as of the justice due to them.  At last the Reformation\r\nhad really great leaders, men who had power and were experienced in the\r\naffairs of the world; it was becoming a political party as well as a\r\nreligious conviction; and the French Reformers were henceforth in a\r\ncondition to make war as well as die at the stake for their faith.\r\nHitherto they had been only believers and martyrs; they became the\r\nvictors and the vanquished, alternately, in a civil war.\r\n\r\nA new position for them, and as formidable as it was grand.  It was\r\ndestined to bring upon them cruel trials and the worth of them in\r\nimportant successes; first, the Saint-Bartholomew, then the accession of\r\nHenry IV. and the edict of Nantes.  At a later period, under Louis XIII.\r\nand Louis XIV., the complication of the religious question and the\r\npolitical question cost them the advantages they had won; the edict of\r\nNantes disappeared together with the power of the Protestants in the\r\nstate.  They were no longer anything but heretics and rebels.  A day was\r\nto come, when, by the force alone of moral ideas, and in the name alone\r\nof conscience and justice, they would recover all the rights they had for\r\na time possessed, and more also; but in the sixteenth century that day\r\nwas still distant, and armed strife was for the Reformers their only\r\nmeans of defence and salvation.  God makes no account of centuries, and a\r\ngreat deal is required before the most certain and the most salutary\r\ntruths get their place and their rights in the minds and communities of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of June, 1559, a brilliant tournament was celebrated in lists\r\nerected at the end of the street of Saint-Antoine, almost at the foot of\r\nthe Bastille.  Henry II., the queen, and the whole court had been present\r\nat it for three days.  The entertainment was drawing to a close.  The\r\nking, who had run several tilts “like a sturdy and skilful cavalier,”\r\n wished to break yet another lance, and bade the Count de Montgomery,\r\ncaptain of the guards, to run against him.  Montgomery excused himself;\r\nbut the king insisted.  The tilt took place.  The two jousters, on\r\nmeeting, broke their lances skilfully; but Montgomery forgot to drop at\r\nonce, according to usage, the fragment remaining in his hand; he\r\nunintentionally struck the king’s helmet and raised the visor, and a\r\nsplinter of wood entered Henry’s eye, who fell forward upon his horse’s\r\nneck.  All the appliances of art were useless; the brain had been\r\ninjured.  Henry II. languished for eleven days, and expired on the 10th\r\nof July, 1559, aged forty years and some months.  An insignificant man,\r\nand a reign without splendor, though fraught with facts pregnant of grave\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Joust between Henri II. and Count de Montgomery----268]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.----FRANCIS II.,  JULY 10, 1559--DECEMBER 5, 1560.\r\n\r\nDuring the course, and especially at the close of Henry II.’s reign, two\r\nrival matters, on the one hand the numbers, the quality, and the zeal of\r\nthe Reformers, and on the other, the anxiety, prejudice, and power of the\r\nCatholics, had been simultaneously advancing in development and growth.\r\nBetween the 16th of May, 1558, and the 10th of July, 1559, fifteen\r\ncapital sentences had been executed in Dauphiny, in Normandy, in Poitou,\r\nand at Paris.  Two royal edicts, one dated July 24, 1558, and the other\r\nJune 14, 1559, had renewed and aggravated the severity of penal\r\nlegislation against heretics.  To secure the registration of the latter,\r\nHenry II., together with the princes and the officers of the crown, had\r\nrepaired in person to Parliament; some disagreement had already appeared\r\nin the midst of that great body, which was then composed of a hundred and\r\nthirty magistrates; the seniors who sat in the great chamber had in\r\ngeneral shown themselves to be more inclined to severity, and the juniors\r\nwho formed the chamber called La Tournelle more inclined to indulgence\r\ntowards accusations of heresy.  The disagreement reached its climax in\r\nthe very presence of the king.  Two councillors, Dubourg and Dufaure,\r\nspoke so warmly of reforms which were, according to them, necessary and\r\nlegitimate, that their adversaries did not hesitate to tax them with\r\nbeing Reformers themselves.  The king had them arrested, and three of\r\ntheir colleagues with them.  Special commissioners were charged with the\r\npreparation of the case against them.  It has already been mentioned that\r\none of the most considerable amongst the officers of the army, Francis\r\nd’Andelot, brother of Admiral Coligny, had, for the same cause, been\r\nsubjected to a burst of anger on the part of the king.  He was in prison\r\nat Meaux when Henry II. died.  Such were the personal feelings and the\r\nrelative positions of the two parties when Francis II., a boy of sixteen,\r\na poor creature both in mind and body, ascended the throne.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Francis II----269]\r\n\r\nDeputies from Parliament went, according to custom, to offer their\r\nfelicitations to the new king, and to ask him “to whom it was his\r\npleasure that they should, thenceforward, apply for to learn his will and\r\nreceive his commands.”  Francis II. replied, “With the approbation of the\r\nqueen my mother, I have chosen the Duke of Guise and the Cardinal of\r\nLorraine, my uncles, to have the direction of the state; the former will\r\ntake charge of the department of war, the latter the administration of\r\nfinance and justice.”  Such had, in fact, been his choice, and it was no\r\ndoubt with his mother’s approbation that he had made it.  Equally\r\nattentive to observe the proprieties and to secure her own power,\r\nCatherine de’ Medici, when going out to drive with her son and her\r\ndaughter-in-law Mary Stuart, on the very day of Henry II.’s death, said\r\nto Mary, “Step in, madame; it is now your turn to go first.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARY STUART----270]\r\n\r\nDuring the first days of mourning she kept herself in a room entirely\r\nhung with black; and there was no light beyond two wax-candles burning on\r\nan altar covered with black cloth.  She had upon her head a black veil,\r\nwhich shrouded her entirely, and hid her face; and, when any one of the\r\nhousehold went to speak to her, she replied in so agitated and so weak\r\na tone of voice that it was impossible to catch her words, whatever\r\nattention might be paid to them.  But her presence of mind and her\r\nenergy, so far as the government was concerned, were by no means affected\r\nby it; he who had been the principal personage at the court under Henry\r\nII., the Constable de Montmorency, perfectly understood, at his first\r\ninterview with the queen-mother, that he was dismissed, and all he asked\r\nof her was, that he might go and enjoy his repose in freedom at his\r\nresidence of Chantilly, begging her at the same time to take under her\r\nprotection the heirs of his house.  Henry II.’s favorite, Diana de\r\nPoitiers, was dismissed more harshly.  “The king sent to tell Madame de\r\nValentinois,” writes the Venetian ambassador, “that for her evil\r\ninfluence (_mali officii_) over the king his father she would deserve\r\nheavy chastisement; but, in his royal clemency, he did not wish to\r\ndisquiet her any further; she must, nevertheless, restore to him all the\r\njewels given her by the king his father.”  “To bend Catherine de’ Medici,\r\nDiana was also obliged,” says De Thou, “to give up her beautiful house at\r\nChenonceaux on the Cher, and she received in exchange the castle of\r\nChaumont on the Loire.”  The Guises obtained all the favors of the court\r\nat the same time that they were invested with all the powers of the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nIn order to give a good notion of Duke Francis of Guise and his brother\r\nthe Cardinal of Lorraine, the two heads of the house, we will borrow the\r\nvery words of those two men of their age who had the best means of seeing\r\nthem close and judging them correctly, the French historian De Thou and\r\nthe Venetian ambassador John Micheli.  “The Cardinal of Lorraine,” says\r\nDe Thou, “was of an impetuous and violent character; the Duke of Guise,\r\non the contrary, was of a gentle and moderate disposition.  But as\r\nambition soon overleaps the confines of restraint and equity, he was\r\ncarried away by the violent counsels of the cardinal, or else surrendered\r\nhimself to them of his own accord, executing with admirable prudence and\r\naddress the plans which were always chalked out by his brother.”  The\r\nVenetian ambassador enters into more precise and full details.  “The\r\ncardinal,” he says, “who is the leading man of the house, would be, by\r\ncommon consent, if it were not for the defects of which I shall speak,\r\nthe greatest political power in this kingdom.  He has not yet completed\r\nhis thirty-seventh year; he is endowed with a marvellous intellect, which\r\napprehends from half a word the meaning of those who converse with him;\r\nhe has an astonishing memory, a fine and noble face, and a rare eloquence\r\nwhich shows itself freely on any subject, but especially in matters of\r\npolitics.  He is very well versed in letters: he knows Greek, Latin, and\r\nItalian.  He is very strong in the sciences, chiefly in theology.  The\r\nexternals of his life are very proper and very suitable to his dignity,\r\nwhich could not be said of the other cardinals and prelates, whose habits\r\nare too scandalously irregular.  But his great defect is shameful\r\ncupidity, which would employ, to attain its ends, even criminal means,\r\nand likewise great duplicity, whence comes his habit of scarcely ever\r\nsaying that which is.  There is worse behind.  He is considered to be\r\nvery ready to take offence, vindictive, envious, and far too slow in\r\nbenefaction.  He excited universal hatred by hurting all the world as\r\nlong as it was in his power to.  As for Mgr. de Guise, who is the eldest\r\nof the six brothers, he cannot be spoken of save as a man of war, a good\r\nofficer.  None in this realm has delivered more battles and confronted\r\nmore dangers.  Everybody lauds his courage, his vigilance, his steadiness\r\nin war, and his coolness, a quality wonderfully rare in a Frenchman.  His\r\npeculiar defects are, first of all, stinginess towards soldiers; then he\r\nmakes large promises, and even when he means to keep his promise he is\r\ninfinitely slow about it.”\r\n\r\nTo the sketch of the Cardinal of Lorraine Brantome adds that he was,\r\n“as indeed he said, a coward by nature.” a strange defect in a Guise.\r\n\r\nIt was a great deal, towards securing the supremacy of a great family\r\nand its leading members, to thus possess the favor of the court and the\r\nfunctions of government; but the power of the Guises had a still higher\r\norigin and a still deeper foundation.  “It was then,” said Michael de\r\nCastelnau, one of the most intelligent and most impartial amongst the\r\nchroniclers of the sixteenth century, “that schism and divisions in\r\nreligious matters began to be mixed up with affairs of state.  Well, all\r\nthe clergy of France, and nearly all the noblesse and the people who\r\nbelonged to the Roman religion, considered that the Cardinal of Lorraine\r\nand the Duke of Guise were, as it were, called of God to preserve the\r\nCatholic religion established in France for the last twelve hundred\r\nyears.  And it seemed to them not only an act of impiety to change or\r\nalter it in any way whatever, but also an impossibility to do so without\r\nruin to the state.  The late king, Henry, had made a decree in the month\r\nof June, 1559, being then at Ecouen, by which the judges were bound to\r\nsentence all Lutherans to death, and which was published and confirmed by\r\nall the Parliaments, without any limitation or modification whatever, and\r\nwith a warning to the judges not to mitigate the penalty, as they had\r\ndone for some years previously.  Different judgments were pronounced upon\r\nthe decree: those who took the most political and most zealous view of\r\nreligion considered that it was necessary, as well to preserve and\r\nmaintain the Catholic religion as to keep down the seditious, who, under\r\nthe cloak of religion, were doing all they could to upset the political\r\ncondition of the kingdom.  Others, who cared nothing for religion, or for\r\nthe state, or for order in the body politic, also thought the decree\r\nnecessary, not at all for the purpose of exterminating the Protestants,\r\n--for they held that it would tend to multiply them,--but because it\r\nwould offer a means of enriching themselves by the confiscations ensuing\r\nupon condemnation, and because the king would thus be able to pay off\r\nforty-two millions of livres which he owed, and have money in hand, and,\r\nbesides that, satisfy those who were demanding recompense for the\r\nservices they had rendered the crown, wherein many placed their hopes.”\r\n [_Memoires de Michael de Castelnau, in the Petitot collection,_ Series\r\nI., t. xxxiii.  pp. 24-27.]\r\n\r\nThe Guises were, in the sixteenth century, the representatives and the\r\nchampions of these different cliques and interests, religious or\r\npolitical, sincere in their belief or shameless in their avidity, and\r\nall united under the flag of the Catholic church.  And so, when they came\r\ninto power, “there was nothing,” says a Protestant chronicler, “but fear\r\nand trembling at their name.”  Their acts of government soon confirmed\r\nthe fears as well as the hopes they had inspired.  During the last six\r\nmonths of 1559 the edict issued by Henry II. from Ecouen was not only\r\nstrictly enforced, but aggravated by fresh edicts; a special chamber was\r\nappointed and chosen amongst the Parliament of Paris, which was to have\r\nsole cognizance of crimes and offences against the Catholic religion.  A\r\nproclamation of the new king, Francis II., ordained that houses in which\r\nassemblies of Reformers took place should be razed and demolished.  It\r\nwas death to the promoters of “unlawful assemblies for purposes of\r\nreligion or for any other cause.”  Another royal act provided that all\r\npersons, even relatives, who received amongst them any one condemned for\r\nheresy should seize him and bring him to justice, in default whereof they\r\nwould suffer the same penalty as he.  Individual condemnations and\r\nexecutions abounded after these general measures; between the 2d of\r\nAugust and the 31st of December, 1559, eighteen persons were burned alive\r\nfor open heresy, or for having refused to communicate according to the\r\nrites of the Catholic church, or go to mass, or for having hawked about\r\nforbidden books.  Finally, in December, the five councillors of the\r\nParliament of Paris, whom, six months previously, Henry II. had ordered\r\nto be arrested and shut up in the Bastille, were dragged from prison and\r\nbrought to trial.  The chief of them, Anne Dubourg, nephew of Anthony\r\nDubourg, Chancellor of France under Francis I., defended himself with\r\npious and patriotic persistency, being determined to exhaust all points\r\nof law and all the chances of justice he could hope for without betraying\r\nhis faith.  Everything shows that he had nothing to hope for from his\r\njudges; one of them, the President Minard, as he was returning from the\r\npalace on the evening of December 12, 1559, was killed by a pistol-shot;\r\nthe assassin could not be discovered; but the crime, naturally ascribed\r\nto some friend of Dubourg, served only to make certain and to hasten the\r\ndeath of the prisoner on trial.  Dubourg was condemned on the 22d of\r\nDecember, and heard unmoved the reading of his sentence.  “I forgive my\r\njudges,” said he; “they have judged according to their own lights, not\r\naccording to the light that comes from on high.  Put out your fires, ye\r\nsenators; be converted, and live happily.  Think without ceasing of God\r\nand on God.”  After these words, which were taken down by the clerk of\r\nthe court, “and which I have here copied,” says De Thou, Dubourg was\r\ntaken on the 23d of December, in a tumbrel to the Place de Greve.  As he\r\nmounted the ladder he was heard repeating several times, “Forsake me not,\r\nmy God, for fear lest I forsake thee.”  He was strangled before he was\r\ncast into the flames (De Thou, t. iii.  pp. 399-402), the sole favor his\r\nfriends could obtain for him.\r\n\r\nBut extreme severity on the part of the powers that be is effectual only\r\nwhen it falls upon a country or upon parties that are effete with age, or\r\nalready vanquished and worn out by long struggles; when, on the contrary,\r\nit is brought to bear upon parties in the flush of youth, eager to\r\nproclaim and propagate themselves, so far from intimidating them, it\r\nanimates them, and thrusts them into the arena into which they were of\r\nthemselves quite eager to enter.  As soon as the rule of the Catholic,\r\nin the persons and by the actions of the Guises, became sovereign and\r\naggressive, the threatened Reformers put themselves into the attitude of\r\ndefence.  They too had got for themselves great leaders, some valiant and\r\nardent, others prudent or even timid, but forced to declare themselves\r\nwhen the common cause was greatly imperilled.  The house of Bourbon,\r\nissuing from St. Louis, had for its representatives in the sixteenth\r\ncentury Anthony de Bourbon, King of Navarre and husband of Jeanne\r\nd’Albret, and his brother Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Conde.  The King of\r\nNavarre, weak and irresolute though brave enough, wavered between\r\nCatholicism and the Reformation, inclining rather in his heart to the\r\ncause of the Reformation, to which the queen his wife, who at first\r\nshowed indifference, had before long become Passionately attached.  His\r\nbrother, the Prince of Conde, young, fiery, and often flighty and rash,\r\nput himself openly at the head of the Reformed party.  The house of\r\nBourbon held itself to be the rival perforce of the house of Lorraine.\r\nIt had amongst the high noblesse of France two allies, more fitted than\r\nany others for fighting and for command, Admiral de Coligny and his\r\nbrother, Francis d’Andelot, both of them nephews of the Constable Anne de\r\nMontmorency, both of them already experienced and famous warriors, and\r\nboth of them devoted, heart and soul, to the cause of the Reformation.\r\nThus, at the accession of Francis II., whilst the Catholic party, by\r\nmeans of the Guises, and with the support of the majority of the country,\r\ntook in hand the government of France, the reforming party ranged\r\nthemselves round the King of Navarre, the Prince of Conde, and Admiral de\r\nColigny, and became, under their direction, though in a minority, a\r\npowerful opposition, able and ready, on the one hand, to narrowly watch\r\nand criticise the actions of those who were in power, and on the other to\r\nclaim for their own people, not by any means freedom as a general\r\nprinciple in the constitution of the state, but free manifestation of\r\ntheir faith, and free exercise of their own form of worship.\r\n\r\nApart from--we do not mean to say above-these two great parties, which\r\nwere arrayed in the might and appeared as the representatives of the\r\nnational ideas and feelings, the queen-mother, Catherine de’ Medici, was\r\nquietly laboring to form another, more independent of the public, and\r\nmore docile to herself, and, above all, faithful to the crown and to the\r\ninterests of the kingly house and its servants; a party strictly\r\nCatholic, but regarding as a necessity the task of humoring the Reformers\r\nand granting them such concessions as might prevent explosions fraught\r\nwith peril to the state; a third party (tiers part), as we should say\r\nnowadays, politic and prudent, somewhat lavish of promises without being\r\nsure of the power to keep them, not much embarrassed at having to change\r\nattitude and language according to the shifting phases of the moment, and\r\nanxious above everything to maintain public peace and to put off\r\nquestions which it could not solve pacifically.  In the sixteenth\r\ncentury, as at every other time, worthy folks of moderate views and\r\nnervous temperaments, ambitious persons combining greed with suppleness,\r\nold servants of the crown, and officials full of scruples and far from\r\nbold in the practical part of government, were the essential elements of\r\nthis party.  The Constable de Montmorency sometimes issued forth from\r\nChantilly to go and aid the queen-mother, in whom he had no confidence,\r\nbut whom he preferred to the Guises.  A former councillor of the\r\nParliament, for a long while chancellor under Francis I. and Henry II.,\r\nand again summoned, under Francis II., by Catherine de’ Medici to the\r\nsame post, Francis Olivier, was an honorable executant of the party’s\r\nindecisive but moderate policy.  He died on the 15th of March, 1560;\r\nand Catherine, in concert with the Cardinal of Lorraine, had the\r\nchancellorship thus vacated conferred upon Michael de l’Hospital, a\r\nmagistrate already celebrated, and destined to become still more so.  As\r\nsoon as he entered upon this great office he made himself remarkable by\r\nthe marvellous ability he showed in restraining within bounds “the\r\nLorraines themselves, whose servant he was,” says the Protestant\r\nchronicler Regnier de la Planche; “to those who had the public weal at\r\nheart he gave hope that all would at last turn out well, provided that he\r\nwere let alone; and, to tell the truth, it would be impossible to\r\nadequately describe the prudence he displayed; for, assuredly, although\r\nif he had taken a shorter road towards manfully opposing the mischief he\r\nwould have deserved more praise, and God would perhaps have blessed his\r\nconstancy, yet, so far as one can judge, he alone, by his moderate\r\nbehavior, was the instrument made use of by God for keeping back many an\r\nimpetuous flood under which every Frenchman would have been submerged.\r\nExternal appearances, however, seemed to the contrary.  In short, when\r\nany one represented to him some trouble that was coming, he always had\r\nthese words on his lips: ‘Patience, patience; all will go well.’”  This\r\nphilosophical and patriotic confidence on the part of Chancellor de\r\nl’Hospital was fated to receive some cruel falsifications.\r\n\r\nA few months, and hardly so much, after the accession of Francis II.,\r\na serious matter brought into violent collision the three parties whose\r\ncharacteristics and dispositions have just been described.  The supremacy\r\nof the Guises was insupportable to the Reformers, and irksome to many\r\nlukewarm or wavering members of the Catholic nobility.  An edict of the\r\nking’s had revoked all the graces and alienations of domains granted by\r\nhis father.  The crown refused to pay its most lawful debts, and duns\r\nwere flocking to the court.  To get rid of them, the Cardinal of Lorraine\r\nhad a proclamation issued by the king, warning all persons, of whatever\r\ncondition, who had come to dun for payment of debts, for compensations,\r\nor for graces, to take themselves off within twenty-four hours on pain of\r\nbeing hanged; and, that it might appear how seriously meant the threat\r\nwas, a very conspicuous gibbet was erected at Fontainebleau close to the\r\npalace.  It was a shocking affront.  The malcontents at once made up to\r\nthe Reformers.  Independently of the general oppression and perils under\r\nwhich these latter labored, they were liable to meet everywhere, at the\r\ncorners of the streets, men posted on the lookout, who insulted them and\r\ndenounced them to the magistrates if they did not uncover themselves\r\nbefore the madonnas set up in their way, or if they did not join in the\r\nlitanies chanted before them.  A repetition of petty requisitions soon\r\nbecomes an odious tyranny.  An understanding was established between very\r\ndifferent sorts of malcontents; they all said and spread abroad that the\r\nGuises were the authors of these oppressive and unjustifiable acts.  They\r\nmade common cause in seeking for means of delivering themselves, at the\r\nsame time drawing an open distinction between the Guises and the king,\r\nthe latter of whom there was no idea of attacking.  The inviolability of\r\nkings and the responsibility of ministers, those two fundamental maxims\r\nof a free monarchy, had already become fixed ideas; but how were they to\r\nbe taken advantage of and put in practice when the institutions whereby\r\npolitical liberty exerts its powers and keeps itself secure were not in\r\nforce?  The malcontents, whether Reformers or Catholics, all cried out\r\nfor the states-general.  Those of Tours, in 1484, under Charles VIII.,\r\nhad left behind them a momentous and an honored memory.  But the Guises\r\nand their partisans energetically rejected this cry.  “They told the king\r\nthat whoever spoke of convoking the states-general was his personal enemy\r\nand guilty of high treason; for his people would fain impose law upon him\r\nfrom whom they ought to take it, in such sort that there would be left to\r\nhim nothing of a king but the bare title.  The queen-mother, though all\r\nthe while giving fair words to the malcontents, whether Reformers or\r\nothers, was also disquieted at their demands, and she wrote to her\r\nson-in-law, Philip II., King of Spain, ‘that they wanted, by means of the\r\nsaid states, to reduce her to the condition of a maid-of-all-work.’\r\nWhereupon Philip replied ‘that he would willingly employ all his forces\r\nto uphold the authority of the king his brother-in-law and of his\r\nministers, and that he had forty thousand men all ready in case anybody\r\nshould be bold enough to attempt to violate it.’”\r\n\r\nIn their perplexity, the malcontents, amongst whom the Reformers were\r\nbecoming day by day the most numerous and the most urgent, determined to\r\ntake the advice of the greatest lawyers and most celebrated theologians\r\nof France and Germany.  They asked whether it would be permissible, with\r\na good conscience and without falling into the crime of high treason, to\r\ntake up arms for the purpose of securing the persons of the Duke of Guise\r\nand the Cardinal of Lorraine, and forcing them to render an account of\r\ntheir administration.  The doctors, on being consulted, answered that it\r\nwould be allowable to oppose by force the far from legitimate supremacy\r\nof the Guises, provided that it were done under the authority of princes\r\nof the blood, born administrators of the realm in such cases, and with\r\nthe consent of the orders composing the state, or the greatest and\r\nsoundest portion of those orders.  A meeting of the princes who were\r\nhostile to the Guises were held at Vendome to deliberate as to the\r\nconduct to be adopted in this condition of opinions and parties;\r\nthe King of Navarre and his brother the Prince of Conde, Coligny,\r\nD’Andelot, and some of their most intimate friends took part in it;\r\nand D’Ardres, confidential secretary to the Constable de Montmorency, was\r\npresent.  The Prince of Conde was for taking up arms at once and swoop\r\ndown upon the Guises, taking them by surprise.  Coligny formally opposed\r\nthis plan; the king, at his majority, had a right, he said, to choose his\r\nown advisers; no doubt it was a deplorable thing to see foreigners at the\r\nhead of affairs, but the country must not, for the sake of removing them,\r\nbe rashly exposed to the scourge of civil war; perhaps it would be enough\r\nif the queen-mother were made acquainted with the general discontent.\r\nThe constable’s secretary coincided with Coligny, whose opinion was\r\ncarried.  It was agreed that the Prince of Conde should restrain his\r\nardor, and let himself be vaguely regarded as the possible leader of the\r\nenterprise if it were to take place, but without giving it, until further\r\nnotice, his name and co-operation.  He was called the mute captain.\r\n\r\nThere was need of a less conspicuous and more pronounced leader for that\r\nwhich was becoming a conspiracy.  And one soon presented himself in the\r\nperson of Godfrey de Barri, Lord of La Renaudie, a nobleman of an ancient\r\nfamily of Perigord, well known to Duke Francis of Guise, under whose\r\norders he had served valiantly at Metz in 1552, and who had for some time\r\nprotected him against the consequences of a troublesome trial, at which\r\nLa Renaudie had been found guilty by the Parliament of Paris of forging\r\nand uttering false titles.  Being forced to leave France, he retired into\r\nSwitzerland, to Lausanne and Geneva, where it was not long before he\r\nshowed the most passionate devotion for the Reformation.  “He was a man,”\r\n says De Thou, “of quick and insinuating wits, ready to undertake\r\nanything, and burning with desire to avenge himself, and wipe out,\r\nby some brilliant deed, the infamy of a sentence which he had incurred\r\nrather through another’s than his own crime.  He, then, readily offered\r\nhis services to those who were looking out for a second leader, and he\r\nundertook to scour the kingdom in order to win over the men whose names\r\nhad been given him.  He got from them all a promise to meet him at Nantes\r\nin February, 1560, and he there made them a long and able speech against\r\nthe Guises, ending by saying, ‘God bids us to obey kings even when they\r\nordain unjust things, and there is no doubt but that they who resist the\r\npowers that God has set up do resist His will.  We have this advantage,\r\nthat we, ever full of submission to the prince, are set against none but\r\ntraitors hostile to their king and their country, and so much the more\r\ndangerous in that they nestle in the very bosom of the state, and, in the\r\nname and clothed with the authority of a king who is a mere child, are\r\nattacking the kingdom and the king himself.  Now, in order that you may\r\nnot suppose that you will be acting herein against your consciences, I am\r\nquite willing to be the first to protest and take God to witness that I\r\nwill not think, or say, or do anything against the king, against the\r\nqueen his mother, against the princes his brothers, or against those of\r\nhis blood; and that, on the contrary, I will defend their majesty and\r\ntheir dignity, and, at the same time, the authority of the laws and the\r\nliberty of the country against the tyranny of a few foreigners.’” [De\r\nThou, t. iii.  pp. 467-480.]\r\n\r\n“Out of so large an assemblage,” adds the historian, “there was not found\r\nto be one whom so delicate an enterprise caused to recoil, or who asked\r\nfor time to deliberate.  It was agreed that, before anything else, a\r\nlarge number of persons, without arms and free from suspicion, should\r\nrepair to court and there present a petition to the king, beseeching him\r\nnot to put pressure upon consciences any more, and to permit the free\r\nexercise of religion; that at almost the same time a chosen body of\r\nhorsemen should repair to Blois, where the king was, that their\r\naccomplices should admit them into the town and present a new petition\r\nto the king against the Guises, and that, if these princes would not\r\nwithdraw and give an account of their administration, they should be\r\nattacked sword in hand; and, lastly, that the Prince of Conde, who had\r\nwished his name to be kept secret up to that time, should put himself at\r\nthe head of the conspirators.  The 15th of June was the day fixed for the\r\nexecution of it all.”\r\n\r\nBut the Guises were warned; one of La Renaudie’s friends had revealed the\r\nconspiracy to the Cardinal of Lorraine’s secretary; and from Spain,\r\nGermany, and Italy they received information as to the conspiracy hatched\r\nagainst them.  The cardinal, impetuous and pusillanimous too, was for\r\ncalling out the troops at once; but his brother the duke, “who was not\r\neasily startled,” was opposed to anything demonstrative.  They removed\r\nthe king to the castle of Amboise, a safer place than the town of Blois;\r\nand they concerted measures with the queen-mother, to whom the\r\nconspirators were, both in their plans and their persons, almost as\r\nobjectionable as to them.  She wrote, in a style of affectionate\r\nconfidence, to Coligny, begging him to come to Amboise and give her his\r\nadvice.  He arrived in company with his brother D’Andelot, and urged the\r\nqueen-mother to grant the Reformers liberty of conscience and of worship,\r\nthe only way to checkmate all the mischievous designs and to restore\r\npeace to the kingdom.  Something of what he advised was done: a royal\r\ndecree was published and carried up to the Parliament on the 15th of\r\nMarch, ordaining the abolition of every prosecution on account of\r\nreligion, in respect of the past only, and under reservations which\r\nrendered the grace almost inappreciable.  The Guises, on their side,\r\nwrote to the Constable de Montmorency to inform him of the conspiracy,\r\n“of which you will feel as great horror as we do,” and they signed, Your\r\nthoroughly best friends.  The Prince of Conde himself, though informed\r\nabout the discovery of the plot, repaired to Amboise without showing any\r\nsigns of being disconcerted at the cold reception offered him by the\r\nLorraine princes.  The Duke of Guise, always bold, even in his\r\nprecautions, “found an honorable means of making sure of him,” says\r\nCastelnau, “by giving him the guard at a gate of the town of Amboise,”\r\n where he had him under watch and ward himself.  The lords and gentlemen\r\nattached to the court made sallies all around Amboise to prevent any\r\nunexpected attack.  “They caught a great many troops badly led and badly\r\nequipped.  Many poor folks, in utter despair and without a leader, asked\r\npardon as they threw down upon the ground some wretched arms they bore,\r\nand declared that they knew no more about the enterprise than that there\r\nhad been a time appointed them to see a petition presented to the king\r\nwhich concerned the welfare of his service and that of the kingdom.”\r\n [_Memoires de Castelnau,_ pp. 49, 50.] On the 18th of March, La Renaudie,\r\nwho was scouring the country, seeking to rally his men, encountered a\r\nbody of royal horse who were equally hotly in quest of the conspirators;\r\nthe two detachments attacked one another furiously; La Renaudie was\r\nkilled, and his body, which was carried to Amboise, was strung up to a\r\ngallows on the bridge over the Loire with this scroll: “This is La\r\nRenaudie, called La Forest, captain of the rebels, leader and author of\r\nthe sedition.”  Disorder continued for several days in the surrounding\r\ncountry; but the surprise attempted against the Guises was a failure, and\r\nthe important result of the riot of Amboise (_tumulte d’Amboise_), as it\r\nwas called, was an ordinance of Francis II., who, on the 17th of March,\r\n1560, appointed Duke Francis of Guise “his lieutenant-general,\r\nrepresenting him in person absent and present in this good town of\r\nAmboise and other places of the realm, with full power, authority,\r\ncommission, and special mandate to assemble all the princes, lords, and\r\ngentlemen, and generally to command, order, provide, and dispose of all\r\nthings requisite and necessary.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Death of La Renaudie----283]\r\n\r\nThe young king was, nevertheless, according to what appears, somewhat\r\ntroubled at all this uproar and at the language of the conspirators.\r\n“I don’t know how it is,” said he sometimes to the Guises, “but I hear it\r\nsaid that people are against you only.  I wish you could be away from\r\nhere for a time, that we might see whether it is you or I that they are\r\nagainst.”  But the Guises set about removing this idea by telling the\r\nking that neither he nor his brothers would live one hour after their\r\ndeparture, and “that the house of Bourbon were only seeking how to\r\nexterminate the king’s house.”  The caresses of the young queen Mary\r\nStuart were enlisted in support of these assertions of her uncles.  They\r\nmade a cruel use of their easy victory “for a whole month,” according to\r\ncontemporary chronicles, “there was nothing but hanging or drowning\r\nfolks.  The Loire was covered with corpses strung, six, eight, ten, and\r\nfifteen, to long poles.  .  .  .”  “What was strange to see,” says\r\nRegnier de la Planche, “and had never been wont under any form of\r\ngovernment, they were led out to execution without having any sentence\r\npronounced against them publicly, or having the cause of their death\r\ndeclared, or having their names mentioned.  They of the Guises reserved\r\nthe chief of them, after dinner, to make sport for the ladies; the two\r\nsexes were ranged at the windows of the castle, as if it were a question\r\nof seeing some mummery played.  And what is worse, the king and his young\r\nbrothers were present at these spectacles, as if the desire were to\r\n‘blood’ them; the sufferers were pointed out to them by the Cardinal of\r\nLorraine with all the signs of a man greatly rejoiced, and when the poor\r\nwretches died with more than usual firmness, he would say, ‘See, sir,\r\nwhat brazenness and madness; the fear of death cannot abate their pride\r\nand felonry.  What would they do, then, if they had you in their\r\nclutches?’”\r\n\r\nIt was too much vengeance to take and too much punishment to inflict for\r\na danger so short-lived and so strictly personal.  So hideous was the\r\nspectacle that the Duchess of Guise, Anne d’Este, daughter of Renee of\r\nFrance, Duchess of Ferrara, took her departure one day, saying, as she\r\ndid so, to Catherine de’ Medici, “Ah! madame, what a whirlwind of hatred\r\nis gathering about the heads of my poor children!”  There was, throughout\r\na considerable portion of the country, a profound feeling of indignation\r\nagainst the Guises.  One of their victims, Villemongey, just as it came\r\nto his turn to die, plunged his hands into his comrades’ blood, saying,\r\n“Heavenly Father, this is the blood of Thy children: Thou wilt avenge\r\nit!” John d’Aubigne, a nobleman of Saintonge, as he passed through\r\nAmboise one market-day with his son, a little boy eight years old,\r\nstopped before the heads fixed upon the posts, and said to the child,\r\n“My boy, spare not thy head, after mine, to avenge these brave chiefs; if\r\nthou spare thyself, thou shalt have my curse upon thee.”  The Chancellor\r\nOlivier himself, for a long while devoted to the Guises, but now\r\nseriously ill and disquieted about the future of his soul, said to\r\nhimself, quite low, as he saw the Cardinal of Lorraine, from whom he had\r\njust received a visit, going out, “Ah! cardinal, you are getting us all\r\ndamned!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Condo----285]\r\n\r\nThe mysterious chieftain, the mute captain of the conspiracy of Amboise,\r\nPrince Louis of Conde, remained unattainted, and he remained at Amboise\r\nitself.  People were astounded at his security.  He had orders not to\r\nmove away; his papers were seized by the grand prelate; but his coolness\r\nand his pride did not desert him for an instant.  We will borrow from the\r\n_Histoire des Princes de Conde_ (t. i.  pp. 68-71), by the Duke of\r\nAumale, the present heir, and a worthy one, of that line, the account of\r\nhis appearance before Francis II., “in full council, in presence of the\r\ntwo queens, the knights of the order, and the great officers of the\r\ncrown.  ‘As I am certified,’ said he, ‘that I have near the king’s person\r\nenemies who are seeking the ruin of me and mine, I have begged him to do\r\nme so much favor as to hear my answer in this company here present.  Now,\r\nI declare that, save his own person and the persons of his brothers, of\r\nthe queen his mother and of the queen regnant, those who have reported\r\nthat I was chief and leader of certain sedition-mongers, who are said to\r\nhave conspired against his person and state, have falsely and miserably\r\nlied.  And renouncing, for the nonce, my quality as prince of the blood,\r\nwhich I hold, however, of God alone, I am ready to make them confess, at\r\nthe sword’s point, that they are cowards and rascals, themselves seeking\r\nthe subversion of the state and the crown, whereof I am bound to promote\r\nthe maintenance by a better title than my accusers.  If there be, amongst\r\nthose present, any one who has made such a report and will maintain it,\r\nlet him declare as much this moment.’  The Duke of Guise, rising to his\r\nfeet, protested that he could not bear to have so great a prince any\r\nlonger calumniated, and offered to be his second.  Conde, profiting by\r\nthe effect produced by his proud language, demanded and obtained leave\r\nto retire from the court, which he quitted at once.”\r\n\r\nAll seemed to be over; but the whole of France had been strongly moved by\r\nwhat had just taken place; and, though the institutions which invite a\r\npeople to interfere in its own destinies were not at the date of the\r\nsixteenth century in regular and effective working order, there was\r\neverywhere felt, even at court, the necessity of ascertaining the feeling\r\nof the country.  On all sides there was a demand for the convocation of\r\nthe states-general.  The Guises and the queen-mother, who dreaded this\r\ngreat and independent national power, attempted to satisfy public opinion\r\nby calling an assembly of notables, not at all numerous, and chosen by\r\nthemselves.  It was summoned to meet on August 21, 1560, at\r\nFontainebleau, in the apartments of the queen-mother.  Some great lords,\r\ncertain bishops, the Constable de Montmorency, two marshals of France,\r\nthe privy councillors, the knights of the order, the secretaries of state\r\nand finance, Chancellor de l’Hospital and Coligny, took part in it; the\r\nKing of Navarre and the Prince of Conde did not respond to the summons\r\nthey received; the constable rode up with a following of six hundred\r\nhorse.  The first day was fully taken up by a statement, presented to the\r\nassembly by L’Hospital, of the evils that had fallen upon France, and by\r\na declaration on the part of the Guises that they were ready to render an\r\naccount of their administration and of their actions.  Next day, just as\r\nthe Bishop of Valence was about to speak, Coligny went up to the king,\r\nmade two genuflections, stigmatized in energetic terms the Amboise\r\nconspiracy and every similar enterprise, and presented two petitions,\r\none intended for the king himself and the other for the queen-mother.\r\n“They were forwarded to me in Normandy,” said he, “by faithful\r\nChristians, who make their prayers to God in accordance with the true\r\nrules of piety.  They ask for nothing but the liberty of holding their\r\nown creed, and that of having temples and celebrating their worship in\r\ncertain fixed places.  If necessary, this petition would be signed by\r\nfifty thousand persons.”  “And I,” said the Duke of Guise brusquely,\r\n“would find a million to sign a contrary petition.”  This incident went\r\nno further between the two speakers.  A great discussion began as to the\r\nreforms desirable in the church, and as to the convocation of a general\r\ncouncil, or, in default thereof, a national council.  The Cardinal of\r\nLorraine spoke last, and vehemently attacked the petitions presented by\r\nAdmiral de Coligny.  “Though couched in moderate and respectful terms,”\r\n said he, “this document is, at bottom, insolent and seditious; it is as\r\nmuch as to say that those gentry would be obedient and submissive if the\r\nking would be pleased to authorize their mischievous sentiments.  For the\r\nrest,” he added, “as it is merely a question of improving morals and\r\nputting in force strict discipline, the meeting of a council, whether\r\ngeneral or national, appears to me quite unnecessary.  I consent to the\r\nholding of the states-general.”\r\n\r\nThe opinion of the Cardinal of Lorraine was adopted by the king, the\r\nqueen-mother, and the assemblage.  An edict dated August 26 convoked a\r\nmeeting of the states-general at Meaux on the 10th of December following.\r\nAs to the question of a council, general or national, it was referred to\r\nthe decision of the pope and the bishops of France.  Meanwhile, it was\r\nannounced that the punishment of sectaries would, for the present, be\r\nsuspended, but that the king reserved to himself and his judges the right\r\nof severely chastising those who had armed the populace and kindled\r\nsedition.  “Thus it was,” adds De Thou, “that the Protestant religion,\r\nhitherto so hated, began to be tolerated, and in a manner authorized, by\r\nconsent of its enemies themselves.”  [_Histoire Universelle,_ t. iii.\r\np. 535.]\r\n\r\nThe elections to the states-general were very stormy; all parties\r\ndisplayed the same ardor; the Guises by identifying themselves more and\r\nmore with the Catholic cause, and employing, to further its triumph, all\r\nthe resources of the government; the Reformers by appealing to the rights\r\nof liberty and to the passions bred of sect and of local independence.\r\nA royal decree was addressed to all the bailiffs of the kingdom.\r\n“Ye shall not fail,” said the king to them, “to keep your eyes open,\r\nand give orders that such mischievous spirits as may be composed of the\r\nremnants of the Amboise rebellion or other gentry, studious of innovation\r\nand alteration in the state, be so discovered and restrained that they be\r\nnot able to corrupt by their machinations, under whatsoever pretexts they\r\nmay hide them, simple folks led on by confidence in the clemency whereof\r\nwe have heretofore made use.”  The bailiffs followed, for the most part\r\nsuccessfully, but in some cases vainly, the instructions they had\r\nreceived.  One morning in December, 1560, the Duke of Guise was visited\r\nby a courier from the Count de Villars, governor of Languedoc; he\r\ninformed the duke that the deputies of that province had just been\r\nappointed, and that they all belonged to the new religion, and were\r\namongst the most devoted to the sect; there was not a moment to lose,\r\n“for they were men of wits, great reputation, and circumspection.  The\r\ngovernor was very vexed at not having been able to prevent their election\r\nand departure; but plurality of votes had carried the day against him.”\r\n This despatch was “no sooner received than some men were got ready to go\r\nand meet those deputies, in order to put them in a place where they would\r\nnever have been able to do good or harm.”  The deputies of Languedoc\r\nescaped this ambuscade, and arrived safe and sound at Orleans; but they\r\n“were kept under strict watch, and their papers were confiscated up to\r\nthe moment when the death of the king occurred to deliver them from all\r\nfear.”  [_Histoire des Etats generaux,_ by G. Picot, t. ii.  pp. 25-29.]\r\nIn Provence, in Dauphiny, in the countship of Avignon, at Lyons, on\r\noccasion and in the midst of the electoral struggle, several local\r\nrisings, seizures of arms, and surprisals of towns took place and\r\ndisturbed the public peace.  There was not yet religious civil war, but\r\nthere were the preparatory note and symptoms of it.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that they were thus laboring to keep out of the\r\napproaching states-general adversaries of obscure rank and belonging to\r\nthe people, the Guises had very much at heart a desire that the great\r\nleaders of the Reformers and of the Catholic malcontents, especially the\r\ntwo princes of the house of Bourbon, the King of Navarre and the Prince\r\nof Conde, should come to this assembly, and there find themselves under\r\nthe thumb of their enemies.  They had not gone to the assemblage of\r\nnotables at Fontainebleau, and their hostility to the Guises had been\r\nopenly shown during and since that absence.  Nothing was left untried to\r\nattract them, not to Meaux any longer, but to Orleans, whither the\r\nmeeting of the states-general had been transferred.  King Francis II.,\r\na docile instrument in the hands of his uncles and his young queen their\r\nniece, wrote letter after letter to the King of Navarre, urging him to\r\nbring with him his brother the Prince of Conde to clear himself of the\r\naccusations brought against him “by these miserable heretics, who made\r\nmarvellous charges against him.  .  .  .  Conde would easily prove the\r\nfalsity of the assertions made by these rascals.”  The King of Navarre\r\nstill hesitated; the king insisted haughtily.  “I should be sorry,” he\r\nwrote on the 30th of August, 1560, “that into the heart of a person of\r\nsuch good family, and one that touches me so nearly, so miserable an\r\ninclination should have entered; being able to assure you that\r\nwhereinsoever he refuses to obey me I shall know perfectly well how to\r\nmake it felt that I am king.”  The Prince of Conde’s mother-in-law, the\r\nCountess of Roye, wrote to the queen-mother that the prince would appear\r\nat court if the king commanded it; but she begged her beforehand not to\r\nthink it strange if, on going to a place where his most cruel enemies had\r\nevery power, he went attended by his friends.  Whether she really were,\r\nor only pretended to be, shocked at what looked like a threat, Catherine\r\nreplied that no person in France had a right to approach the king in any\r\nother wise than with his ordinary following, and that, if the Prince of\r\nConde went to court with a numerous escort, he would find the king still\r\nbetter attended.  At last the King of Navarre and his brother made up\r\ntheir minds.  How could they elude formal orders?  Armed resistance had\r\nbecome the only possible resource, and the Prince of Conde lacked means\r\nto maintain it; his scarcity of money was such that, in order to procure\r\nhim a thousand gold crowns, his mother-in-law had been obliged to pledge\r\nher castle of Germany to the Constable de Montmorency.  In spite of fears\r\nand remonstrances on the part of their most sincere friends, the two\r\nchiefs of the house of Bourbon left their homes and set out for Orleans.\r\nOn their arrival before Poitiers, great was their surprise: the governor,\r\nMontpezat, shut the gates against them as public enemies.  They were on\r\nthe point of abruptly retracing their steps; but Montpezat had ill\r\nunderstood his instructions; he ought to have kept an eye upon the\r\nBourbons without displaying any bad disposition towards them, so long as\r\nthey prosecuted their journey peacefully; the object was, on the\r\ncontrary, to heap upon them marks of respect, and neglect nothing to give\r\nthem confidence.  Marshal de Termes, despatched in hot haste, went to\r\nopen the gates of Poitiers to the princes, and receive them there with\r\nthe honors due to them.  They resumed their route, and arrived on the\r\n30th of October at Orleans.\r\n\r\nThe reception they there met with cannot be better described than it has\r\nbeen by the Duke of Aumale: “Not one of the crown’s officers came to\r\nreceive the princes; no honor was paid them; the streets were deserted,\r\nsilent, and occupied by a military guard.  In conformity with usage, the\r\nKing of Navarre presented himself on horseback at the great gate of the\r\nroyal abode; it remained closed.  He had to pocket the insult, and pass\r\non foot through the wicket, between a double row of gentlemen wearing an\r\nair of insolence.  The king awaited the princes in his chamber; behind\r\nhim were ranged the Guises and the principal lords; not a word, not a\r\nsalutation on their part.  After this freezing reception, Francis II.\r\nconducted the two brothers to his mother, who received them, according to\r\nRegnier de la Planche’s expression, ‘with crocodile’s tears.’  The Guises\r\ndid not follow them thither, in order to escape any personal dispute, and\r\nso as not to be hearers of the severe words which they had themselves\r\ndictated to the young monarch.  The king questioned Conde sharply; but\r\nthe latter, ‘who was endowed with great courage, and spoke as well as\r\never any prince or gentleman in the world, was not at all startled, and\r\ndefended his cause with many good and strong reasons,’  protesting his\r\nown innocence and accusing the Guises of calumniation.  When he haughtily\r\nalluded to the word of honor which had been given him, the king,\r\ninterrupting him, made a sign; and the two captains of the guard, Breze\r\nand Chavigny, entered and took the prince’s sword.  He was conducted to a\r\nhouse in the city, near the Jacobins’, which was immediately barred,\r\ncrenelated, surrounded by soldiers, and converted into a veritable\r\nbastile.  Whilst they were removing him thither, Conde exclaimed loudly\r\nagainst this brazen violation of all the promises of safety by which he\r\nhad been lured on when urged to go to Orleans.  The only answer he\r\nreceived was his committal to absolutely solitary confinement and the\r\nwithdrawal of his servants.  The King of Navarre vainly asked to have his\r\nbrother’s custody confided to him; he obtained nothing but a coarse\r\nrefusal; and he himself, separated from his escort, was kept under ocular\r\nsupervision in his apartment.”\r\n\r\nThe trial of the Prince of Conde commenced immediately.  He was brought\r\nbefore the privy council.  He claimed, as a prince of the blood and\r\nknight of the order of St. Michael, his right to be tried only by the\r\ncourt of Parliament furnished with the proper complement of peers and\r\nknights of the order.  This latter safeguard was worth nothing in his\r\ncase, for there had been created, just lately, eighteen new knights, all\r\nfriends and creatures of the Guises.  His claim, however, was rejected;\r\nand he repeated it, at the same time refusing to reply to any\r\ninterrogation, and appealing “from the king ill advised to the king\r\nbetter advised.”  A priest was sent to celebrate mass in his chamber: but\r\n“I came,” said he, “to clear myself from the calumnies alleged against\r\nme, which is of more consequence to me than hearing mass.”  He did not\r\nattempt to conceal his antipathy towards the Guises, and the part he had\r\ntaken in the hostilities directed against them.  An officer, to whom\r\npermission had been given to converse with him in presence of his\r\ncustodians, told him “that an appointment (accommodation) with the Duke\r\nof Guise would not be an impossibility for him.”  “Appointment between\r\nhim and me!” answered Conde: “it can only be at the point of the lance.”\r\n The Duchess Renee of Ferrara, daughter of Louis XII., having come to\r\nFrance at this time, went to Orleans to pay her respects to the king.\r\nThe Duke of Guise was her son-in-law, and she reproached him bitterly\r\nwith Conde’s trial.  “You have just opened,” said she, “a wound which\r\nwill bleed a long while; they who have dared to attack persons of the\r\nblood royal have always found it a bad job.”  The prince asked to see, in\r\nthe presence of such persons as the king might appoint, his wife, Eleanor\r\nof Roye, who, from the commencement of the trial, “solicited this favor\r\nnight and day, often throwing herself on her knees before the king with\r\ntears incredible; but the Cardinal of Lorraine, fearing lest his Majesty\r\nshould be moved with compassion, drove away the princess most rudely,\r\nsaying that, if she had her due, she would herself be placed in the\r\nlowest dungeon.”  For them of Guise the princess was a thorn in the\r\nflesh, for she lacked not wits, or language, or courage, insomuch that\r\nthey had some discussion about making away with her.  [_Memoires de\r\nCastelnau,_ p. 119; _Histoire de l’Etat de France, Cant de la Republique\r\nque de la Religion, sous Francois II.,_ by L. Regnier, Sieur de la\r\nPlanche.]  She demanded that at any rate able lawyers might act as\r\ncounsel for her husband.  Peter Robert and Francis de Marillac, advocates\r\nof renown in the Parliament of Paris, were appointed by the king for that\r\npurpose, but their assistance proved perfectly useless; on the 26th of\r\nNovember, 1560, the Prince of Conde was sentenced to death; and the\r\nsentence was to be carried out on the 10th of December, the very day of\r\nthe opening of the states-general.  Most of the historians say that, when\r\nit came to the question of signing it, three judges only, Chancellor de\r\nl’Hospital, the councillor of state, Duportail, and the aged Count of\r\nSancerre, Louis de Bueil, refused to put their names to it.  “For my\r\npart,” says the scrupulous De Thou, “I can see nothing quite certain as\r\nto all that.  I believe that the sentence of death was drawn up and not\r\nsigned.  I remember to have heard it so said a long while afterwards by\r\nmy father, a truthful and straightforward man, to whom this form of\r\nsentence had always been distasteful.”\r\n\r\nMany contemporaries report, and De Thou accords credence to the report,\r\nthat, in order to have nothing more to fear from the house of Bourbon,\r\nthe Guises had resolved to make away with King Anthony of Navarre as well\r\nas his brother the Prince of Conde, but by another process.  Feeling\r\npersuaded that it would be impossible to obtain against the elder brother\r\na sentence ever so little in accordance with justice, for his conduct had\r\nbeen very reserved, they had, it is said, agreed that King Francis II.\r\nshould send for the King of Navarre into his closet and reproach him\r\nseverely for his secret complicity with his brother Conde, and that if\r\nthe King of Navarre defended himself stubbornly, he should be put to\r\ndeath on the spot by men posted there for the purpose.  It is even added\r\nthat Francis II. was to strike the first blow.  Catherine de’ Medici, who\r\nwas beginning to be disquieted at the arrogance and successes of the\r\nLorraine princes, sent warning of this peril to the King of Navarre by\r\nJacqueline de Longwy, Duchess of Montpensier; and, just as he was\r\nproceeding to the royal audience from which he was not sure to return,\r\nAnthony de Bourbon, who was wanting in head rather than in heart, said to\r\nRenty, one of his gentlemen, “If I die yonder, carry my blood-stained\r\nshirt to my wife and my son, and tell my wife to send it round to the\r\nforeign princes of Christendom, that they may avenge my death, as my son\r\nis not yet of sufficient age.”  We may remark that the wife was Jeanne\r\nd’Albret, and the son was to be Henry IV.  According to the chroniclers,\r\nwhen Francis II. looked in the eyes of the man he was to strike, his\r\nfierce resolve died away: the King of Navarre retired, safe and sound,\r\nfrom the interview, and the Duke of Guise, irritated at the weakness of\r\nthe king his master, muttered between his teeth, “‘Tis the very whitest\r\nliver that ever was.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of De Thou’s indorsement of this story, it is doubtful whether\r\nits authenticity can be admitted; if the interview between the two kings\r\ntook place, prudence on the part of the King of Navarre seems to be quite\r\nas likely an explanation of the result as hesitation to become a murderer\r\non the part of Francis II.\r\n\r\nOne day Conde was playing cards with some officers on guard over him,\r\nwhen a servant of his who had been permitted to resume attendance on his\r\nmaster, pretending to approach him for the purpose of picking up a card,\r\nwhispered in his ear, “Our gentleman is _croqued_.”  The prince,\r\nmastering his emotion, finished his game.  He then found means of being\r\nfor a moment alone with his servant, and learned from him that Francis\r\nII. was dead.  [_Histoire des Princes de Conde, by the Duke d’Aumale,_\r\nt. i.  p. 94.]  On the 17th of November, 1560, as he was mounting his\r\nhorse to go hunting, he fainted suddenly.  He appeared to have recovered,\r\nand was even able to be present when the final sentence was pronounced\r\nagainst Conde; but on the 29th of November there was a fresh\r\nfainting-fit.  It appears that Ambrose Pare, at that time the first\r\nsurgeon of his day, and a faithful Reformer, informed his patron, Admiral\r\nColigny, that there would not be long to wait, and that it was all over\r\nwith the king.  Up to the very last moment, either by themselves or\r\nthrough their niece Mary Stuart, the Guises preserved their influence\r\nover him: Francis II. sent for the King of Navarre, to assure him that it\r\nwas quite of his own accord, and not by advice of the Guises, that he had\r\nbrought Conde to trial.  He died on the 5th of December, 1560, of an\r\neffusion on the brain, resulting from a fistula and an abscess in the\r\near.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mary Stuart----284]\r\n\r\nThrough a fog of brief or doubtful evidence we can see at the bedside of\r\nthis dying king his wife Mary Stuart, who gave him to the last her tender\r\nministrations, and Admiral de Coligny, who, when the king had heaved his\r\nlast sigh, rose up, and, with his air of pious gravity, said aloud before\r\nthe Cardinal of Lorraine and the others who were present, “Gentlemen, the\r\nking is dead.  A lesson to us to live.”  At the same moment the Constable\r\nde Montmorency, who had been ordered some time ago to Orleans, but had,\r\naccording to his practice, travelled but slowly, arrived suddenly at the\r\ncity gate, threatened to hang the ill-informed keepers of it, who\r\nhesitated to let him enter, and hastened to fold in his arms his niece,\r\nthe Princess of Conde, whom the death of Francis II.  restored to hope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Coligny at the Death-bed of Francis II.----295]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.----CHARLES IX. AND THE RELIGIOUS WARS. (1560-1574.)\r\n\r\nWe now enter upon the era of the civil wars, massacres, and\r\nassassinations caused by religious fanaticism or committed on religious\r\npretexts.  The latter half of the sixteenth century is the time at which\r\nthe human race saw the opening of that great drama, of which religious\r\nliberty is the beginning and the end; and France was then the chief scene\r\nof it.  At the close of the fifteenth and at the commencement of the\r\nsixteenth centuries, religious questions had profoundly agitated\r\nChristian Europe; but towards the middle of the latter century they had\r\nobtained in the majority of European states solutions which, however\r\nincomplete, might be regarded as definitive.  Germany was divided into\r\nCatholic states and Protestant states, which had established between\r\nthemselves relations of an almost pacific character.  Switzerland was\r\nentering upon the same course.  In England, Scotland, the Low Countries,\r\nthe Scandinavian states, and the free towns their neighbors, the\r\nReformation had prevailed or was clearly tending to prevail.  In Italy,\r\nSpain, and Portugal, on the contrary, the Reformation had been stifled,\r\nand Catholicism remained victorious.  It was in France that,\r\nnotwithstanding the inequality of forces, the struggle between\r\nCatholicism and Protestantism was most obstinately maintained, and\r\nappeared for the longest time uncertain.  After half a century of civil\r\nwars and massacres it terminated in Henry IV., a Protestant king, who\r\nturned Catholic, but who gave Protestants the edict of Nantes; a\r\nprecious, though insufficient and precarious pledge, which served France\r\nas a point of departure towards religious liberty, and which protected it\r\nfor nearly a century, in the midst of the brilliant victory won by\r\nCatholicism.  [The edict of Nantes, published by Henry IV. in 1598, was\r\nrevoked by Louis XIV. in 1685.]\r\n\r\nFor more than three centuries civilized Europe has been discussing, pro\r\nor con, the question of religious liberty, but from instinct and with\r\npassion far more than with a serious understanding of what is at the\r\nbottom of things.  Even in our own day it is not without difficulty that\r\na beginning is being made to understand and accept that principle in its\r\ntrue sense and in all its bearings.  Men were wonderfully far from it in\r\n1560, at the accession of Charles IX., a child ten years old; they were\r\nentering, in blind confidence, upon a religious war, in order to arrive,\r\nonly after four centuries of strife and misconception, at a vindication\r\nof religious liberty.  “Woe to thee, O country, that hast a child for\r\nking!” said, in accordance with the Bible, the Venetian Michael Suriano,\r\nambassador to France at that time.  Around that royal child, and seeking\r\nto have the mastery over France by being masters over him, were\r\nstruggling the three great parties at that time occupying the stage in\r\nthe name of religion.  The Catholics rejected altogether the idea of\r\nreligious liberty for the Protestants; the Protestants had absolute need\r\nof it, for it was their condition of existence; but they did not wish for\r\nit in the case of the Catholics, their adversaries.  The third party\r\n(_tiers parti_), as we call it nowadays, wished to hold the balance\r\ncontinually wavering between the Catholics and the Protestants, conceding\r\nto the former and the latter, alternately, that measure of liberty which\r\nwas indispensable for most imperfect maintenance of the public peace, and\r\nreconcilable with the sovereign power of the kingship.  On such\r\nconditions was the government of Charles IX. to establish its existence.\r\n\r\nThe death of Francis II. put an end to a grand project of the Guises,\r\nwhich we do not find expressly indicated elsewhere than in the _Memoires_\r\nof Michael de Castelnau, one of the best informed and most intelligent\r\nhistorians of the time.  “Many Catholics,” says he, “were then of opinion\r\nthat, if the authority of the Duke of Guise had continued to be armed\r\nwith that of the king as it had been, the Protestants would have had\r\nenough to do.  For orders had been sent to all the principal lords of the\r\nkingdom, officers of the crown and knights of the order, to show\r\nthemselves in the said city of Orleans on Christmas-day at the opening of\r\nthe states, for that they might be all made to sign the confession of the\r\nCatholic faith in presence of the king and the chapter of the order;\r\ntogether with all the members of the privy council, reporting-masters (of\r\npetitions), domestic officers of the king’s household, and all the\r\ndeputies of the estates.  The same confession was to be published\r\nthroughout all the said kingdom, in order to have it sworn by all the\r\njudges, magistrates, and officers, and, finally, all private persons from\r\nparish to parish.  And in default of so doing, proceedings were to be\r\ntaken by seizures, condemnations, executions, banishments, and\r\nconfiscations.  And they who did repent themselves and abjured their\r\nProtestant religion were to be absolved.”  [_Memoires de Michel de\r\nCastelnau,_ book ii.  chap. xii.  p. 121, in the _Petitot_ collection.]\r\nIt is not to be supposed that, even if circumstances had remained as they\r\nwere under the reign of Francis II., such a plan could have been\r\nsuccessful; but it is intelligible that the Guises had conceived such an\r\nidea: they were victorious; they had just procured the condemnation to\r\ndeath of the most formidable amongst the Protestant princes, their\r\nadversary Louis de Conde; they were threatening the life of his brother\r\nthe King of Navarre; and the house of Bourbon seemed to be on the point\r\nof disappearing beneath the blows of the ambitious, audacious, and by no\r\nmeans scrupulous house of Lorraine.  Not even the prospect of Francis\r\nII.’s death arrested the Guises in their work and their hopes; when they\r\nsaw that he was near his end, they made a proposal to the queen-mother to\r\nunite herself completely with them, leave the Prince of Conde to\r\nexecution, rid herself of the King of Navarre, and become regent of the\r\nkingdom during the minority of her son Charles, taking them, the Lorraine\r\nprinces and their party, for necessary partners in her government.  But\r\nCatherine de’ Medici was more prudent, more judicious, and more\r\negotistical in her ambition than the Guises were in theirs; she was not,\r\nas they were, exclusively devoted to the Catholic party; it was power\r\nthat she wanted, and she sought for it every day amongst the party or the\r\nmixtures of parties in a condition to give it her.  She considered the\r\nCatholic party to be the strongest, and it was hers; but she considered\r\nthe Protestant party strong enough to be feared, and to give her a\r\ncertain amount of security and satisfaction: a security necessary,\r\nmoreover, if peace at home, and not civil war, were to be the habitual\r\nand general condition of France.  Catherine was, finally, a woman, and\r\nvery skilful in the strifes of court and of government, whilst, on the\r\nfield of battle, the victories, though won in her name, would be those of\r\nthe Guises more than her own.  Without openly rejecting the proposals\r\nthey made to her under their common apprehension of Francis II.’s\r\napproaching death, she avoided making any reply.  She had, no doubt,\r\nalready taken her precautions and her measures in advance; her\r\nconfidante, Jacqueline de Longwy, Duchess of Montpensier and a zealous\r\nProtestant, had brought to her rooms at night Antony de Bourbon, King of\r\nNavarre, and Catherine had come to an agreement with him about the\r\npartition of power between herself and him at the death of the king her\r\nson.  She had written to the Constable de Montmorency, a rival of the\r\nGuises and their foe though a stanch Catholic, to make haste to Orleans,\r\nwhere his presence would be required.  As soon as Chancellor de\r\nl’Hospital became aware of the proposals which were being made by the\r\nGuises to the queen-mother, he flew to her and opposed them with all the\r\nenergy of his great and politic mind and sterling nature.  Was she going\r\nto deliver the Prince of Conde to the scaffold, the house of Bourbon to\r\nruin, France to civil war, and the independence of the crown and of that\r\nroyal authority which she was on the point of wielding herself to the\r\ntyrannical domination of her rivals the Lorraine princes and of their\r\nparty?  Catherine listened with great satisfaction to this judicious and\r\nhonest language.  When the crown passed to her son Charles she was free\r\nfrom any serious anxiety as to her own position and her influence in the\r\ngovernment.  The new king, on announcing to the Parliament the death of\r\nhis brother, wrote to them that “confiding in the virtues and prudence of\r\nthe queen-mother, he had begged her to take in hand the administration of\r\nthe kingdom, with the wise counsel and advice of the King of Navarre and\r\nthe notables and great personages of the late king’s council.”  A few\r\nmonths afterwards the states-general, assembling first at Orleans and\r\nafterwards at Pontoise, ratified this declaration by recognizing the\r\nplacement of “the young King Charles IX.’s guardianship in the hands of\r\nCatherine de’ Medici, his mother, together with the principal direction\r\nof affairs, but without the title of regent.”  The King of Navarre was to\r\nassist her in the capacity of lieutenant-general of the kingdom.\r\nTwenty-five members specially designated were to form the king’s privy\r\ncouncil. [_Histoire des Etats generaux,_ by M. Picot, t. ii.  p. 73.]\r\nAnd in the privacy of her motherly correspondence Catherine wrote to the\r\nQueen of Spain, her daughter Elizabeth, wife of Philip II., “Madame, my\r\ndear daughter, all I shall tell you is, not to be the least anxious, and\r\nto rest assured that I shall spare no pains to so conduct myself that\r\nGod and everybody may have occasion to be satisfied with me.  .  .  .\r\nYou have seen the time when I was as happy as you are, not dreaming of\r\never having any greater trouble than that of not being loved as I should\r\nhave liked to be by the king your father.  God took him from me, and is\r\nnot content with that; He has taken from me your brother, whom I loved\r\nyou well know how much, and has left me with three young children, and\r\nin a kingdom where all is division, having therein not a single man in\r\nwhom I can trust, and who has not some particular object of his own.”\r\n\r\nThe queen-mother of France, who wrote to her daughter the Queen of Spain\r\nwith such firmness of tone and such independence of spirit, was, to use\r\nthe words of the Venetian ambassador John Michieli, who had lived at her\r\ncourt, “a woman of forty-three, of affable manners, great moderation,\r\nsuperior intelligence, and ability in conducting all sorts of affairs,\r\nespecially affairs of state.  As mother, she has the personal management\r\nof the king; she allows no one else to sleep in his room; she is never\r\naway from him.  As regent and head of the government, she holds\r\neverything in her hands, public offices, benefices, graces, and the seal\r\nwhich bears the king’s signature, and which is called the cachet\r\n(privy-seal or signet).  In the council, she allows the others to speak;\r\nshe replies to any one who needs it; she decides according to the advice\r\nof the council, or according to what she may have made up her own mind\r\nto. She opens the letters addressed to the king by his ambassadors and\r\nby all the ministers.  .  .  .  She has great designs, and does not\r\nallow them to be easily penetrated.  As for her way of living, she is\r\nvery fond of her ease and pleasure; she observes few rules; she eats and\r\ndrinks a great deal; she considers that she makes up for it by taking a\r\ngreat deal of exercise a-foot and a-horseback; she goes a-hunting; and\r\nlast year she always joined the king in his stag-chases, through the\r\nwoods and thick forests, a dangerous sort of chase for anyone who is not\r\nan excellent rider.  She has an olive complexion, and is already very\r\nfat; accordingly the doctors have not a good opinion of her life.  She\r\nhas a dower of three hundred thousand francs a year, double that of\r\nother queens-dowager.  She was formerly always in money-difficulties and\r\nin debt; now, she not only keeps out of debt, but she spends and gives\r\nmore liberally than ever.”  [_Relations des Ambassadeurs venztzens,_\r\npublished by A. N. Tommaseo, t. i.  pp. 427-429.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the reign of Charles IX.  and the queen-mother’s government\r\nwere established, notice was sent to the Prince of Conde that he was\r\nfree.  He refused to stir from prison; he would wait, he said, until his\r\naccusers were confined there.  He was told that it was the king’s express\r\norder, and was what Francis II. on his death-bed had himself impressed\r\nupon the King of Navarre.  Conde determined to set out for La Fere, a\r\nplace belonging to his brother Anthony de Bourbon, and there await fresh\r\norders from the king.  In February, 1561, he left La Fare for\r\nFontainebleau.  On his road to Paris his friends flocked to him and made\r\nhim a splendid escort.  On approaching the king’s palace Conde separated\r\nhimself from his following, and advanced alone with two of his most\r\nfaithful friends.  All the lords of the court, the Duke of Guise amongst\r\nthem, went to meet him.  On the 15th of March he was admitted to the\r\nprivy council.  Chancellor de l’Hospital, on the prince’s own demand,\r\naffirmed that no charge had been found against him.  The king declared\r\nhis innocence in a deed signed by all the members of the council.  On the\r\n13th of June, in solemn session, the Parliament of Paris, sitting as a\r\ncourt of peers, confirmed this declaration.  Notwithstanding the Duke of\r\nGuise’s co-operation in all these acts, Conde desired something of a more\r\npersonal kind on his part.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Francis de Lorraine, Duke of Aumale and of Guise----302]\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of August, at St. Germain, in presence of the king, the\r\nqueen-mother, the princes, and the court, the Duke of Guise, in reply to\r\na question from the king, protested “that he had not, and would never\r\nhave desired to, put forward anything against the prince’s honor, and\r\nthat he had been neither the author nor the instigator of his\r\nimprisonment.”  “Sir,” said Conde, “I consider wicked and contemptible\r\nhim or them who caused it.”  “So I think, sir,” answered Guise, “and it\r\ndoes not apply to me at all.”  Whereupon they embraced, and a report was\r\ndrawn up of the ceremony, which was called their reconciliation.  Just as\r\nit was ending, Marshal Francis de Montmorency, eldest son of the\r\nconstable, and far more inclined than his father was towards the cause of\r\nthe Reformers, arrived with a numerous troop of friends, whom he had\r\nmustered to do honor to Conde.  The court was a little excited at this\r\nincident.  The constable declared that, having the honor to be so closely\r\nconnected with the princes of Bourbon, his son would have been to blame\r\nif he had acted differently.  The aged warrior had himself negotiated\r\nthis reconciliation; and when it was accomplished, and the Duke of Guise\r\nhad performed his part in it with so much complaisance, the constable\r\nconsidered himself to be quits with his former allies, and free to\r\nfollow his leaning towards the Catholic party. “The veteran,” says the\r\nDuke of Autnale, “did not pique himself on being a theologian; but he\r\nwas sincerely attached to the Catholic faith because it was the old\r\nreligion and the king’s; and he separated himself definitively from\r\nthose religious and political innovators whom he had at first seemed to\r\ncountenance, and amongst whom he reckoned his nearest relatives.”  In\r\nvain did his eldest son try to hold him back; a close union was formed\r\nbetween the Constable de Montmorency, the Duke of Guise, and Marshal de\r\nSaint-Andre, and it became the Catholic triumvirate against which\r\nCatherine de’ Medici had at one time to defend herself, and of which she\r\nhad at another to avail herself in order to carry out the policy of\r\nsee-saw she had adopted as her chief means of government.\r\n\r\nBefore we call to mind and estimate as they deserve the actions of that\r\ngovernment, we must give a correct idea of the moral condition of the\r\npeople governed, of their unbridled passions, and of the share of\r\nresponsibility reverting to them in the crimes and shocking errors of\r\nthat period.  It is a mistake and an injustice, only too common, to lay\r\nall the burden of such facts, and the odium justly due to them, upon the\r\ngreat actors almost exclusively whose name has remained attached to them\r\nin history; the people themselves have very often been the prime movers\r\nin them; they have very often preceded and urged on their masters in the\r\nblack deeds which have sullied their history; and on the masses as well\r\nas on the leaders ought the just sentence of posterity to fall.  The\r\nmoment we speak of the St. Bartholomew, it seems as if Charles IX.,\r\nCatherine de’ Medici, and the Guises issued from their grave to receive\r\nthat sentence; and God forbid that we should wish to deliver them from\r\nit; but it hits the nameless populace of their day as well as themselves,\r\nand the hands of the people, far more than the will of kings, began the\r\ntale of massacres for religion’s sake.  This is no vague and general\r\nassertion; and, to show it, we shall only have to enumerate, with their\r\ndates, the principal facts of which history has preserved the memory,\r\nwhilst stigmatizing them, with good reason, as massacres or murders.  The\r\ngreater number, as was to be expected, are deeds done by Catholics, for\r\nthey were by far the more numerous and more frequently victorious; but\r\nProtestants also have sometimes deserved a place in this tragic category,\r\nand when we meet with them, we will assuredly not blot them out.\r\n\r\nWe confine the enumeration to the reign of Charles IX., and in it we\r\nplace only such massacres and murders as were not the results of any\r\nlegal proceeding.  We say nothing of judicial sentences and executions,\r\nhowever outrageous and iniquitous they may have been.\r\n\r\nThe first fact which presents itself is a singular one.  Admiral de\r\nColigny’s eldest brother, Odet de Chatillon, was a Catholic, Bishop of\r\nBeauvais, and a cardinal; in 1550, he had gone to Rome and had\r\nco-operated in the election of Pope Julius III.; in 1554, he had\r\npublished some _Constitutions synodales_ (synodal regulations), to remedy\r\ncertain abuses which had crept into his diocese, and, in 1561, he\r\nproposed to make in the celebration of the Lord’s Supper some\r\nmodifications which smacked, it is said, of the innovations of Geneva.\r\nThe populace of Beauvais were so enraged at this that they rose up\r\nagainst him, massacred a schoolmaster whom he tried to protect, and would\r\nhave massacred the bishop himself if troops sent from Paris had not come\r\nto his assistance.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, 1561, the Protestants had a custom of meeting at Paris,\r\nfor their religious exercises, in a house called the Patriarch’s house,\r\nvery near the church of St. Medard.  On the 27th of December, whilst the\r\nReformed minister was preaching, the Catholics had all the bells of St.\r\nMedard rung in full peal.  The minister sent two of his congregation to\r\nbeg the incumbent to have the bell-ringing stopped for a short time.  The\r\nmob threw themselves upon the two messengers: one was killed, and the\r\nother, after making a stout defence, returned badly wounded to the\r\nPatriarch’s house, and fell dead at the preacher’s feet.  The provost of\r\ntradesmen was for having the bells stopped; the riot became violent; the\r\nhouse of the Reformers was stormed; and the provost’s archers had great\r\ndifficulty in putting a stop to the fight.  More than a hundred persons,\r\nit is said, were killed or wounded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Massacre of Protestants---305]\r\n\r\nIn 1562, in the month of February, whilst the Guises were travelling in\r\nGermany, with the object of concluding, in the interests of policy,\r\nalliances with some German Lutheran princes, disturbances broke out at\r\nCahors, Amiens, Sens, and Tours, between the Protestants and the\r\nCatholics.  Which of the two began them?  It would be difficult to\r\ndetermine.  The passions that lead to insult, attack, defence, and\r\nvengeance were mutually felt and equally violent on both sides.  Montluc\r\nwas sent to Guienne by the queen-mother to restore order there; but\r\nnearly everywhere he laid the blame on the Protestants.  His Memoires\r\nprove that he harried them without any form of justice.  “At Sauveterre,”\r\n says he, “I caught five or six, all of whom I had hanged without expense\r\nof paper or ink, and without giving them a hearing, for those gentry are\r\nregular Chrysostoms (_parlent d’or_).”  “I was informed that at Gironde\r\nthere were sixty or eighty Huguenots belonging to them of La Reole, who\r\nhad retreated thither; the which were all taken, and I had them hanged to\r\nthe pillars of the market-place without further ceremony.  One hanged has\r\nmore effect than a hundred slain.”  When Montluc took Monsegur, “the\r\nmassacre lasted for ten hours or more,” says he, “because search was made\r\nfor them in the houses; the dead were counted and found to be more than\r\nseven hundred.”  [_Memoires de Montluc,_ t. ii.  pp. 442, 443-447.]\r\n\r\nAlmost at the very time at which Montluc, who had been sent to Guienne to\r\nrestore order there between the Catholics and the Protestants, was\r\ntreating the latter with this shocking severity, an incident, more\r\nserious because of the rank of the persons concerned, took place at\r\nVassy, a small town in Champagne, near which the Duke of Guise passed on\r\nreturning from Germany.  Hearing, as he went, the sound of bells, he\r\nasked what it meant.  “It is the church of the Huguenots of Vassy,” was\r\nthe answer.  “Are there many of them?” asked the duke.  He was told that\r\nthere were, and that they were increasing more and more.  “Then,” says\r\nthe chronicler, “he began to mutter and to put himself in a white heat,\r\ngnawing his beard, as he was wont to do when he was enraged or had a mind\r\nto take vengeance.”  Did he turn aside out of his way with his following,\r\nto pass right through Vassy, or did he confine himself to sending some of\r\nhis people to bring him an account of what was happening there?  When a\r\nfact which was at the outset insignificant has become a great event, it\r\nis hardly possible to arrive at any certain knowledge of the truth as to\r\nthe small details of its origin.  Whatever may have been the case in the\r\nfirst instance, a quarrel, and, before long, a struggle, began between\r\nthe preacher’s congregation and the prince’s following.  Being informed\r\nof the matter whilst he was at table, the Duke of Guise rose up, went to\r\nthe spot, found the combatants very warmly at work, and himself received\r\nseveral blows from stones; and, when the fight was put a stop to,\r\nforty-nine persons had been killed in it, nearly all on the Protestant\r\nside; more than two hundred others, it is said, came out of it severely\r\nwounded; and, whether victors or vanquished, all were equally irritated.\r\nThe Protestants complained vehemently; and Conde offered, in their name,\r\nfifty thousand men to resent this attack, but his brother, the King of\r\nNavarre, on the contrary, received with a very bad grace the pleading of\r\nTheodore de Beze.  “It is true that the church of God should endure\r\nblows and not inflict them,” said De Beze, “but remember, I pray you,\r\nthat it is an anvil which has used up a great many hammers.”\r\n\r\nThe massacre of Vassy, the name which has remained affixed to it in\r\nhistory, rapidly became contagious.  From 1562 to 1572, in Languedoc, in\r\nProvence, in Dauphiny, in Poitou, in Orleanness, in Normandy even and in\r\nPicardy, at Toulouse, at Gaillac, at Frejus, at Troyes, at Sens, at\r\nOrleans, at Amiens, at Rouen, and in many other towns, spontaneous and\r\ndisorderly outbreaks between religiously opposed portions of the populace\r\ntook place suddenly, were repeated, and spread, sometimes with the\r\nconnivance of the local authorities, judicial or administrative, but more\r\noften through the mere brutal explosion of the people’s passions.  It is\r\ndistasteful to us to drag numerous examples from oblivion; but we will\r\ncite just two, faithful representations of those sad incidents, and\r\nattested by authentic documents.  The little town of Gaillac was almost\r\nentirely Catholic; the Protestants, less numerous, had met the day after\r\nPentecost, May 18, 1562, to celebrate the Lord’s Supper.  “The\r\ninhabitants in the quarter of the Chateau de l’Orme, who are all artisans\r\nor vine-dressers,” says the chronicler, “rush to arms, hurry along with\r\nthem all the Catholics of the town, invest the place of assembly, and\r\ntake prisoners all who were present.  After this capture, they separate:\r\nsome remain in the meeting-house, on guard over the prisoners; the rest\r\ngo into dwellings to work their will upon those of the religion who had\r\nremained there.  Then they take the prisoners, to the number of sixty or\r\neighty, into a gallery of the Abbey of St. Michael, situated on a steep\r\nrock, at the base of which flows the River Tarn; and there, a field\r\nlaborer, named Cabral, having donned the robe and cape of the judge’s\r\ndeputy, whom he had slain with his own hand, pronounces judgment, and\r\nsentences all the prisoners to be thrown from the gallery into the river,\r\ntelling them to go and eat fish, as they had not chosen to fast during\r\nLent; which was done forthwith.  Divers boatmen who were on the river\r\ndespatched with their oars those who tried to save themselves by\r\nswimming.”  [_Histoire generale du Languedoc,_ liv.  xxxviii.  f. v., p.\r\n227.]  At Troyes, in Champagne, “during the early part of August, 1572,\r\nthe majority of the Protestants of the town, who were returning from\r\nEsleau-Mont, where they had a meeting-house and a pastor under\r\nauthorization from the king, were assailed in the neighborhood of\r\nCroncels by the excited populace.  A certain number of individuals,\r\naccompanying a mother carrying a child which had just received baptism,\r\nwere pursued with showers of stones; several were wounded, and the child\r\nwas killed in its mother’s arms.”  This affair did not give rise to any\r\nprosecution.  “It is no use to think about it any longer,” said the\r\ndelegate of the bailiff and of the mayor of Troyes, in a letter from\r\nParis on the 27th of August.  The St. Bartholomew had just taken place\r\non the 24th of August.  [_Histoire de la Ville de Troyes,_ by H. Boutiot,\r\nt. iii.  p. 25.]\r\n\r\nWhere they happened to be the stronger, and where they had either\r\nvengeance to satisfy or measures of security to take, the Protestants\r\nwere not more patient or more humane than the Catholics.  At Nimes, in\r\n1567, they projected and carried out, in the town and the neighboring\r\ncountry, a massacre in which a hundred and ninety-two Catholics perished;\r\nand several churches and religious houses were damaged or completely\r\ndestroyed.  This massacre, perpetrated on St. Michael’s day, was called\r\n_the Michaelade_.  The barbarities committed against the Catholics in\r\nDauphiny and in Provence by Francis de Beaumont, Baron of Adrets, have\r\nremained as historical as the massacre of Vassy, and he justified them on\r\nthe same grounds as Montluc had given for his in Guienne.  “Nobody\r\ncommits cruelty in repaying it,” said he; “the first are called\r\ncruelties, the second justice.  The only way to stop the enemy’s\r\nbarbarities is to meet them with retaliation.”  Though experience ought\r\nto have shown them their mistake, both Adrets and Montluc persisted in\r\nit.  A case, however, is mentioned in which Adrets was constrained to be\r\nmerciful.  After the capture of Montbrison, he had sentenced all the\r\nprisoners to throw themselves down, with their hands tied behind them,\r\nfrom the top of the citadel; one of them made two attempts, and thought\r\nbetter of it; “Come, twice is enough to take your soundings,” shouted the\r\nbaron, who was looking on.  “I’ll give you four times to do it in,”\r\n rejoined the soldier.  And this good saying saved his life.\r\n\r\nThe weak and undecided government of Catherine de’ Medici tried several\r\ntimes, but in vain, to prevent or repress these savage explosions of\r\npassion and strife amongst the people; the sterling moderation of\r\nChancellor de l’Hospital was scarcely more successful than the\r\nhypocritical and double-faced attentions paid by Catherine de’ Medici to\r\nboth the Catholic and the Protestant leaders; the great maladies and the\r\ngreat errors of nations require remedies more heroic than the adroitness\r\nof a woman, the wisdom of a functionary, or the hopes of a philosopher.\r\nIt was formal and open civil war between the two communions and the two\r\nparties that, with honest and patriotic desire, L’Hospital and even\r\nCatherine were anxious to avoid.  From 1561 to 1572 there were in France\r\neighteen or twenty massacres of Protestants, four or five of Catholics,\r\nand thirty or forty single murders sufficiently important to have been\r\nkept in remembrance by history; and during that space of time formal\r\ncivil war, religious and partisan, broke out, stopped and recommenced in\r\nfour campaigns, signalized, each of them, by great battles, and four\r\ntimes terminated by impotent or deceptive treaties of peace which, on the\r\n24th of August, 1572, ended, for their sole result, in the greatest\r\nmassacre of French history, the St. Bartholomew.\r\n\r\nThe first religious war, under Charles IX., appeared on the point of\r\nbreaking out in April, 1561, some days after that the Duke of Guise,\r\nreturning from the massacre of Vassy, had entered Paris, on the 16th of\r\nMarch, in triumph.  The queen-mother, in dismay, carried off the king to\r\nMelun at first, and then to Fontainebleau, whilst the Prince of Conde,\r\nhaving retired to Meaux, summoned to his side his relatives, his friends,\r\nand all the leaders of the Reformers, and wrote to Coligny, “that Caesar\r\nhad not only crossed the Rubicon, but was already at Rome, and that his\r\nbanners were beginning to wave all over the neighboring country.”  For\r\nsome days Catherine and L’Hospital tried to remain out of Paris with the\r\nyoung king, whom Guise, the Constable de Montmorency, and the King of\r\nNavarre, the former being members and the latter an ally of the\r\ntriumvirate, went to demand back from them.  They were obliged to submit\r\nto the pressure brought to bear upon them.  The constable was the first\r\nto enter Paris, and went, on the 2d of April, and burned down the two\r\nplaces of worship which, by virtue of the decree of January 17, 1561, had\r\nbeen granted to the Protestants.  Next day the King of Navarre and the\r\nDuke of Guise, in their turn, entered the city in company with Charles\r\nIX. and Catherine.  A council was assembled at the Louvre to deliberate\r\nas to the declaration of war, which was deferred.  Whilst the king was on\r\nhis way back to Paris, Conde hurried off to take up his quarters at\r\nOrleans, whither Coligny went promptly to join him.  They signed, with\r\nthe gentlemen who came to them from all parts, a compact of association\r\n“for the honor of God, for the liberty of the king, his brothers and the\r\nqueen-mother, and for the maintenance of decrees;” and Conde, in writing\r\nto the Protestant princes of Germany to explain to them his conduct, took\r\nthe title of protector of the house and crown of France.  Negotiations\r\nstill went on for nearly three months.  The chiefs of the two parties\r\nattempted to offer one another generous and pacific solutions; they even\r\nhad two interviews; but Catherine was induced by the Catholic triumvirate\r\nto expressly declare that she could not allow in France more than one\r\nsingle form of worship.  Conde and his friends said that they could not\r\nlay down their arms until the triumvirate was overthrown, and the\r\nexecution of decrees granting them liberty of worship, in certain places\r\nand to a certain extent, had been secured to them.  Neither party liked\r\nto acknowledge itself beaten in this way without having struck a blow.\r\nAnd in the early part of July, 1562, the first religious war began.\r\n\r\nWe do not intend to dwell upon any but its leading facts, facts which at\r\nthe moment when they were accomplished might have been regarded as\r\ndecisive in respect of the future.  In this campaign there were two; the\r\nbattle of Dreux, on the 19th of December, 1562; and the murder of the\r\nDuke of Guise by Poltrot, on the 18th of February, 1563.\r\n\r\nThe two armies met in the plain of Dreux with pretty nearly equal forces,\r\nthe royal army being superior in artillery and the Protestant in cavalry.\r\nWhen they had arrived in front of one another, the triumvirs sent to ask\r\nthe queen-mother’s authority to give battle.  “I am astounded,” said\r\nCatherine to her favorite adviser, Michael de Castelnau, “that the\r\nconstable, the Duke of Guise, and Saint-Andre, being good, prudent, and\r\nexperienced captains, should send to ask counsel of a woman and a child,\r\nboth full of sorrow at seeing things in such extremity as to be reduced\r\nto the risk of a battle between fellow-countrymen.”  “Hereupon,” says\r\nCastelnau, “in came the king’s nurse, who was a Huguenot, and the queen,\r\nat the same time that she took me to see the king, who was still in bed,\r\nsaid to me with great agitation and jeeringly, ‘We had better ask the\r\nking’s nurse whether to give battle or not; what think you?’  Then the\r\nnurse, as she followed the queen into the king’s chamber according to her\r\ncustom, said several times that, as the Huguenots would not listen to\r\nreason, she would say, ‘Give battle.’  Whereupon there was, at the privy\r\ncouncil, much discourse about the good and the evil that might result\r\ntherefrom; but the resolution arrived at was, that they who had arms in\r\ntheir hands ought not to ask advice or orders from the court; and I was\r\ndespatched on the spot to tell them from the king and the queen, that, as\r\ngood and prudent captains, they were to do what they considered most\r\nproper.”  Next day, at ten in the morning, the armies met.  “Then\r\nevery one,” says La Noue, one of the bravest amongst the Reformers’\r\nleaders, “steadied himself, reflecting that the men he saw coming towards\r\nhim were not Spaniards, or English, or Italians, but Frenchmen, that is,\r\nthe bravest of the brave, amongst whom there were some who were his own\r\ncomrades, relatives, and friends, and that within an hour they would have\r\nto be killing one another, which created some sort of horror of the fact,\r\nwithout, however, diminution of courage.  .  .  .  One thing worthy of\r\nbeing noted,” continues La Noue, “is the long duration of the fight, it\r\nbeing generally seen in battles that all is lost or won within a single\r\nhour, whereas this began about one P. M., and there was no issue until\r\nafter five.  Of a surety, there was marvellous animosity on both sides,\r\nwhereof sufficient testimony is to be found in the number of dead, which\r\nexceeded seven thousand, as many persons say; the majority whereof were\r\nkilled in the fight rather than the pursuit.  .  .  .  Another incident\r\nwas the capture of the two chiefs of the armies, a thing which rarely\r\nhappens, because generally they do not fight until the last moment and in\r\nextremity; and often a battle is as good as won before they come to this\r\npoint.  But in this case they did not put it off so long, for, at the\r\nvery first, each was minded to set his men an example of not sparing\r\nthemselves.  The Constable de Montmorency was the first taken, and\r\nseriously wounded, having always received wounds in seven battles at\r\nwhich he was present, which shows the boldness that was in him.  The\r\nPrince of Conde was taken at the end, also wounded.  As both of them had\r\ngood seconds, it made them the less fearful of danger to their own\r\npersons, for the constable had M. de Guise, and the Prince of Conde\r\nAdmiral de Coligny, who showed equally well to the front in the melley.\r\n.  .  .  Finally I wish to bring forward another matter, which will be\r\nsupernumerary because it happened after the battle; and that is, the\r\ncourteous and honorable behavior of the Duke of Guise victorious towards\r\nthe Prince of Conde a prisoner; which most men, on one side as well as on\r\nthe other, did not at all think he would have been disposed to exhibit,\r\nfor it is well known how hateful, in civil wars, are the chiefs of\r\nparties, and what imputations are made upon them.  Nevertheless here\r\nquite the contrary happened: for, when the prince was brought before the\r\nduke, the latter spoke to him respectfully and with great gentleness of\r\nlanguage, wherein he could not pretend that there was any desire to pique\r\nhim or blame him.  And whilst the prince staid in the camp, the duke\r\noften dined with him.  And forasmuch as on this day of the battle there\r\nwere but few beds arrived, for the baggage had been half-plundered and\r\ndispersed, the Duke of Guise offered his own bed to the Prince of Conde,\r\nwhich the prince would accept in respect of the half only.  And so these\r\ntwo great princes, who were like mortal foes, found themselves in one\r\nbed, one triumphant and the other captive, taking their repast together.”\r\n [_Memoires de Francois de La Noue,_ in the _Petitot_ collection; 1st\r\nseries, t. xxxiv.  pp. 172-178.]\r\n\r\nThe results of the battle of Dreux were serious, and still more serious\r\nfrom the fate of the chiefs than from the number of the dead.  The\r\ncommanders of the two armies, the Constable de Montmorency, and the\r\nPrince of Conde, were wounded and prisoners.  One of the triumvirs,\r\nMarshal de Saint-Andre, had been killed in action.  The Catholics’\r\nwavering ally, Anthony de Bourbon, King of Navarre, had died before the\r\nbattle of a wound which he had received at the siege of Rouen; and on his\r\ndeath-bed had resumed his Protestant bearing, saying that, if God granted\r\nhim grace to get well, he would have nothing but the gospel preached\r\nthroughout the realm.  The two staffs (_etats-majors_), as we should now\r\nsay, were disorganized: in one, the Duke of Guise alone remained unhurt\r\nand at liberty; in the other, Coligny, in Conde’s absence, was elected\r\ngeneral-in-chief of the Protestants.  At Paris, for a while, it was\r\nbelieved that the battle was lost.  “If it had been,” says Montluc,\r\n“I think that it was all over with France, for the state would have\r\nchanged, and so would the religion; a young king can be made to do as\r\nyou please;” Catherine de’ Medici showed a facile resignation to such a\r\nchange.  “Very well,” she had said, “then we will pray to God in French.”\r\n When the victory became known there was general enthusiasm for the Duke.\r\nof Guise; but he took only a very modest advantage of it, being more\r\nanxious to have his comrades’ merits appreciated than his own.  At Blois,\r\nas he handed the queen-mother her table-napkin at dinner-time, he asked\r\nher if he might have an audience of her after the repast.  “Jesu! my dear\r\ncousin,” said Catherine, “whatever are you saying?”  “I say it, madame,\r\nbecause I would fain show you in the presence of everybody what I have\r\ndone, since my departure from Paris, with your army which you gave in\r\ncharge to me together with the constable, and also present to you all the\r\ngood captains and servants of the king and of yourself who have served\r\nyou faithfully, as well your own subjects as also foreigners, and\r\nhorsemen and foot;” whereupon he discoursed about the battle of Dreux,\r\n“and painted it so well and so to the life,” says Brantome, “that you\r\nwould have said that they were still about it, whereat the queen felt\r\nvery great pleasure.  .  .  .  Every one listened very attentively,\r\nwithout the least noise in the world; and he spoke so well that there was\r\nnone who was not charmed, for the prince was the best of speakers and\r\neloquent, not with a forced and overladen eloquence, but simple and\r\nsoldierly, with a grace of his own to match; so much so that the\r\nqueen-mother said that she had never seen him in such good form.”\r\n [Brantome, _Tries des Brands Capitaines,_ t. ii.  pp. 247-250.]  The good\r\nform, however, was not enough to prevent the ill-humor and jealousy felt\r\nby the queen-mother and her youthful son the king at such a great success\r\nwhich made Guise so great a personage.  After the victory of Dreux he had\r\nwritten to the king to express his wish to see conferred upon a candidate\r\nof his own choosing the marshal’s baton left vacant by the death of\r\nSaint-Andre.  “See now,” said Charles IX. to his mother and some persons\r\nwho were by, “if the Duke of Guise does not act the king well; you would\r\nreally say that the army was his, and that victory came from his hand,\r\nmaking no mention of God, who, by His great goodness, hath given it us.\r\nHe thrusts the bargain into my fist (dictates to me).  Yet must I give\r\nhim a civil answer to satisfy him; for I do not want to make trouble in\r\nmy kingdom, and irritate a captain to whom my late father and I have\r\ngiven so much credit and authority.”  The king almost apologized for\r\nhaving already disposed of the baton in favor of the Marquis de\r\nVieilleville, and he sent the Duke of Guise the collar of the order for\r\ntwo of his minions, and at the same time the commission of\r\nlieutenant-general of the kingdom and commander-in-chief of the army for\r\nhimself. Guise thanked him, pretending to be satisfied: the king smiled\r\nas he read his letter; and “_Non ti fidar, e non sarai gabbato_” (Don’t\r\ntrust, and you’ll not be duped), he said in the words of the Italian\r\nproverb.\r\n\r\nHe had not to disquiet himself for long about this rival.  On the 18th of\r\nFebruary, 1563, the Duke of Guise was vigorously pushing forward the\r\nsiege of Orleans, the stronghold of the Protestants, stoutly defended by\r\nColigny.  He was apprised that his wife, the Duchess Anne d’Este, had\r\njust arrived at a castle near the camp with the intention of using her\r\ninfluence over her husband in order to spare Orleans from the terrible\r\nconsequences of being taken by assault.  He mounted his horse to go and\r\njoin her, and he was chatting to his aide-de-camp Rostaing about the\r\nmeans of bringing about a pacification, when, on arriving at a cross-road\r\nwhere several ways met, he felt himself struck in the right shoulder,\r\nalmost under the arm, by a pistol-shot fired from behind a hedge at a\r\ndistance of six or seven paces.  A white plume upon his head had made him\r\nconspicuous, and as, for so short a ride, he had left off his cuirass,\r\nthree balls had passed through him from side to side.  “That shot has\r\nbeen in keeping for me a long while,” said he: “I deserve it for not\r\nhaving taken precautions.”  He fell upon his horse’s neck, as he vainly\r\ntried to draw his sword from the scabbard; his arm refused its office.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Duke of Guise waylaid---315]\r\n\r\nWhen he had been removed to the castle, where the duchess, in tears,\r\nreceived him, “I am vexed at it,” said he, “for the honor of France;” and\r\nto his son Henry, Prince of Joinville, a boy of thirteen, he added,\r\nkissing him, “God grant you grace, my son, to become a good man.”  He\r\nlanguished for six days, amidst useless attentions paid him by his\r\nsurgeons, giving Catherine de’ Medici, who came daily to see him, the\r\nmost pacific counsels, and taking of the duchess his wife the most tender\r\nfarewells mingled with the most straightforward and honest avowals.  “I\r\ndo not mean to deny,” he said to her, “that the counsels and frailties of\r\nyouth have led me sometimes into something at which you had a right to be\r\noffended; I pray you to be pleased to excuse me and forgive me.”  His\r\nbrother, the Cardinal de Guise, Bishop of Metz, which the duke had so\r\ngloriously defended against Charles V., warned him that it was time to\r\nprepare himself for death by receiving the sacraments of the church.\r\n“Ah! my dear brother,” said the duke to him, “I have loved you greatly in\r\ntimes past, but I love you now still more than ever, for you are doing me\r\na truly brotherly turn.”  On the 24th of February they still offered him\r\naliment to sustain his rapidly increasing weakness but “Away, away,” said\r\nhe; “I have taken the manna from heaven, whereby I feel myself so\r\ncomforted that it seems to me as if I were already in paradise.  This\r\nbody has no further need of nourishment;” and so he expired on the 24th\r\nof February, 1563, an object, at his death, of the most profound regret\r\namongst his army and his party, as well as his family, after having been\r\nduring his life the object of their lively admiration.  “I do not\r\nforget,” says his contemporary Stephen Pasquier in reference to him,\r\n“that it was no small luck for him to die at this period, when he was\r\nbeyond reach of the breeze, and when shifting Fortune had not yet played\r\nhim any of those turns whereby she is so cunning in lowering the horn of\r\nthe bravest.”\r\n\r\nIt is a duty to faithfully depict this pious and guileless death of a\r\ngreat man, at the close of a vigorous and a glorious life, made up of\r\ngood and evil, without the evil’s having choked the good.  This powerful\r\nand consolatory intermixture of qualities is the characteristic of the\r\neminent men of the sixteenth century, Catholics or Protestants, soldiers\r\nor civilians; and it is a spectacle wholesome to be offered in times when\r\ndoubt and moral enfeeblement are the common malady even of sound minds\r\nand of honest men.\r\n\r\nThe murderer of Duke Francis of Guise was a petty nobleman of Angoumois,\r\nJohn Poltrot, Lord of Mere, a fiery Catholic in his youth, who afterwards\r\nbecame an equally fiery Protestant, and was engaged with his relative La\r\nRenaudie in the conspiracy against the Guises.  He had been employed\r\nconstantly from that time, as a spy it is said, by the chiefs of the\r\nReformers--a vocation for which, it would seem, he was but little\r\nadapted, for the indiscretion of his language must have continually\r\nrevealed his true sentiments.  When he heard, in 1562, of the death of\r\nAnthony de Bourbon, King of Navarre, “That,” said he, “is not what will\r\nput an end to the war; what is wanted is the dog with the big collar.”\r\n “Whom do you mean?”  asked somebody.  “The great Guisard; and here’s the\r\narm that will do the trick.”  “He used to show,” says D’Aubigne, “bullets\r\ncast to slay the Guisard, and thereby rendered himself ridiculous.”\r\n After the battle of Dreux he was bearer of a message from the Lord of\r\nSoubise to Admiral de Coligny, to whom he gave an account of the\r\nsituation of the Reformers in Dauphiny and in Lyonness.  His report no\r\ndoubt interested the admiral, who gave him twenty crowns to go and play\r\nspy in the camp of the Duke of Guise, and, some days later, a hundred\r\ncrowns to buy a horse.  It was thus that Poltrot was put in a position to\r\nexecute the design he had been so fond of proclaiming before he had any\r\ncommunication with Coligny.  As soon as, on the 18th of February, 1563,\r\nin the outskirts of Orleans, he had, to use his own expression, done his\r\ntrick, he fled full gallop, so as not to bear the responsibility of it;\r\nbut, whether it were that he was troubled in his mind, or that he was ill\r\nacquainted with the region, he wandered round and round the place where\r\nhe had shot the Duke of Guise, and was arrested on the 20th of February\r\nby men sent in search of him.  Being forthwith brought before the privy\r\ncouncil, in the presence of the queen-mother, and put to the torture, he\r\nsaid that Admiral de Coligny, Theodore de Beze, La Rochefoucauld,\r\nSoubise, and other Huguenot chiefs had incited him to murder the Duke of\r\nGuise, persecutor of the faithful, “as a meritorious deed in the eyes of\r\nGod and men.”  Coligny repudiated this allegation point blank.  Shrinking\r\nfrom the very appearance of hypocrisy, he abstained from any regret at\r\nthe death of the Duke of Guise.  “The greatest blessing,” said he, “which\r\ncould come to this realm and to the church of God, especially to myself\r\nand all my house;” and he referred to conversations he had held with the\r\nCardinal of Lorraine and the Duchess of Guise, and to a notice which he\r\nhad sent, a few days previously, to the Duke of Guise himself, “to take\r\ncare, for there was somebody under a bond to kill him.”  Lastly, he\r\ndemanded that, to set in a clear light “his integrity, innocence, and\r\ngood repute,” Poltrot should be kept, until peace was made, in strict\r\nconfinement, so that the admiral himself and the murderer might be\r\nconfronted.  It was not thought to be obligatory or possible to comply\r\nwith this desire; amongst the public there was a passionate outcry for\r\nprompt chastisement.  Poltrot, removed to Paris, put to the torture and\r\nquestioned by the commissioners of Parliament, at one time confirmed and\r\nat another disavowed his original assertions.  Coligny, he said, had not\r\nsuggested the project to him, but had cognizance of it, and had not\r\nattempted to deter him.  The decree sentenced Poltrot to the punishment\r\nof regicides.  He underwent it on the 18th of March, 1563, in the Place\r\nde Greve, preserving to the very end that fierce energy of hatred and\r\nvengeance which had prompted his deed.  He was heard saying to himself in\r\nthe midst of his torments, and as if to comfort himself, “For all that,\r\nhe is dead and gone,--the persecutor of the faithful,--and he will not\r\ncome back again.”  The angry populace insulted him with yells; Poltrot\r\nadded, “If the persecution does not cease, vengeance will fall upon this\r\ncity, and the avengers are already at hand.”\r\n\r\nCatherine de’ Medici, well pleased, perhaps, that there was now a\r\nquestion personally embarrassing for the admiral and as yet in abeyance,\r\nhad her mind entirely occupied apparently with the additional weakness\r\nand difficulty resulting to the position of the crown and the Catholic\r\nparty from the death of the Duke of Guise; she considered peace\r\nnecessary; and, for reasons of a different nature, Chancellor de\r\nl’Hospital was of the same opinion: he drew attention to “scruples of\r\nconscience, the perils of foreign influence, and the impossibility of\r\ncuring by an application of brute force a malady concealed in the very\r\nbowels and brains of the people.”  Negotiations were entered into with\r\nthe two captive generals, the Prince of Conde and the Constable de\r\nMontmorency; they assented to that policy; and, on the 19th of March,\r\npeace was concluded at Amboise in the form of an edict which granted to\r\nthe Protestants the concessions recognized as indispensable by the crown\r\nitself, and regulated the relations of the two creeds, pending “the\r\nremedy of time, the decisions of a holy council, and the king’s\r\nmajority.”  Liberty of conscience and the practice of the religion\r\n“called Reformed” were recognized “for all barons and lords\r\nhigh-justiciary, in their houses, with their families and dependants;\r\nfor nobles having fiefs without vassals and living on the king’s lands,\r\nbut for them and their families personally.”  The burgesses were treated\r\nless favorably; the Reformed worship was maintained in the towns in\r\nwhich it had been practised up to the 7th of March in the current year;\r\nbut, beyond that and noblemen’s mansions, this worship might not be\r\ncelebrated save in the faubourgs of one single town in every bailiwick\r\nor seneschalty.  Paris and its district were to remain exempt from any\r\nexercise of the said “Reformed religion.”\r\n\r\nDuring the negotiations and as to the very basis of the edict of March\r\n19, 1563, the Protestants were greatly divided; the soldiers and the\r\npoliticians, with Conde at their head, desired peace, and thought that\r\nthe concessions made by the Catholics ought to be accepted.  The majority\r\nof the Reformed pastors and theologians cried out against the\r\ninsufficiency of the concessions, and were astonished that there should\r\nbe so much hurry to make peace when the Catholics had just lost their\r\nmost formidable captain.  Coligny, moderate in his principles, but always\r\nfaithful to his church when she made her voice heard, showed\r\ndissatisfaction at the selfishness of the nobles.  “To confine the\r\nreligion to one town in every bailiwick,” he said, “is to ruin more\r\nchurches by a stroke of the pen than our enemies could have pulled down\r\nin ten years; the nobles ought to have recollected that example had been\r\nset by the towns to them, and by the poor to the rich.”  Calvin, in his\r\ncorrespondence with the Reformed churches of France, severely handled\r\nConde on this occasion.  At the moment when peace was made, the pacific\r\nwere in the right; the death of the Duke of Guise had not prevented the\r\nbattle of Dreux from being a defeat for the Reformers; and, when war had\r\nto be supported for long, it was especially the provincial nobles and the\r\npeople on their estates who bore the burden of it.  But when the edict of\r\nAmboise had put an end to the first religious war, when the question was\r\nno longer as to who won or lost battles, but whether the conditions of\r\nthat peace to which the Catholics had sworn were loyally observed, and\r\nwhether their concessions were effective in insuring the modest amount of\r\nliberty and security promised to the Protestants, the question changed\r\nfront, and it was not long before facts put the malcontents in the right.\r\nBetween 1563 and 1567 murders of distinguished Protestants increased\r\nstrangely, and excited amongst their families anxiety accompanied by a\r\nthirst for vengeance.  The Guises and their party, on their side,\r\npersisted in their outcries for proceedings against the instigators,\r\nknown or presumed, of the murder of Duke Francis.  It was plainly against\r\nAdmiral de Coligny that these cries were directed; and he met them by a\r\nsecond declaration, very frank as a denial of the deed which it was\r\nintended to impute to him, but more hostile than ever to the Guises and\r\ntheir party.  “The late duke,” said he, “was of the whole army the man I\r\nhad most looked out for on the day of the last battle; if I could have\r\nbrought a gun to bear upon him to kill him, I would have done it; I would\r\nhave ordered ten thousand arquebusiers, had so many been under my\r\ncommand, to single him out amongst all the others, whether in the field,\r\nor from over a wall, or from behind a hedge.  In short, I would not have\r\nspared any of the means permitted by the laws of war in time of hostility\r\nto get rid of so great an enemy as he was for me and for so many other\r\ngood subjects of the king.”\r\n\r\nAfter three years of such deadly animosity between the two parties and\r\nthe two houses, the king and the queen-mother could find no other way\r\nof stopping an explosion than to call the matter on before the privy\r\ncouncil, and cause to be there drawn up, on the 29th of January, 1566,\r\na solemn decree, “declaring the admiral’s innocence on his own\r\naffirmation, given in the presence of the king and the council as before\r\nGod himself, that he had not had anything to do with or approved of the\r\nsaid homicide.  Silence for all time to come was consequently imposed\r\nupon the attorney-general and everybody else; inhibition and prohibition\r\nwere issued against the continuance of any investigation or prosecution.\r\nThe king took the parties under his safeguard, and enjoined upon them\r\nthat they should live amicably in obedience to him.”  By virtue of this\r\ninjunction, the Guises, the Colignies, and the Montmorencies ended by\r\nembracing, the first-named accommodating themselves with a pretty good\r\ngrace to this demonstration: “but God knows what embraces!” [Words used\r\nin La Harenga, a satire of the day in burlesque verse upon the Cardinal\r\nof Lorraine.] Six years later the St. Bartholomew brought the true\r\nsentiments out into broad daylight.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that the war was proceeding amongst the provinces with\r\nthis passionate doggedness, royal decrees were alternately confirming and\r\nsuppressing or weakening the securities for liberty and safety which the\r\ndecree of Amboise, on the 19th of March, 1563, had given to the\r\nProtestants by way of re-establishing peace.  It was a series of\r\ncontradictory measures which were sufficient to show the party-strife\r\nstill raging in the heart of the government.  On the 14th of June, 1563,\r\nProtestants were forbidden to work, with shops open, on the days of\r\nCatholic festivals.  On the 14th of December, 1563, it was proclaimed\r\nthat Protestants might not gather alms for the poor of their religion,\r\nunless in places where that religion was practised, and nowhere else.\r\nOn the 24th of June, 1564, a proclamation from the king interdicted the\r\nexercise of the Reformed religion within the precincts of any royal\r\nresidence.  On the 4th of August, 1564, the Reformed churches were\r\nforbidden to hold synods and make collections of money, and their\r\nministers to quit their places of residence and to open schools.  On the\r\n12th of November, 1567, a king’s ordinance interdicted the conferring of\r\njudiciary offices on non-Catholics.  In vain did Conde and Coligny cry\r\nout loudly against these violations of the peace of Amboise; in vain, on\r\nthe 16th of August, 1563, at the moment of proclaiming the king’s\r\nmajority, was an edict issued giving full and entire confirmation to the\r\nedict of the 19th of March preceding, with the addition of prescriptions\r\nfavorable to the royal authority, as well as, at the same time, to the\r\nmaintenance of the public peace; scarcely any portion of these\r\nprescriptions was observed; the credit of Chancellor de l’Hospital was\r\nclearly very much on the decline; and, whilst the legal government was\r\nthus falling to pieces or languishing away, Gaspard de Tavannes, a proved\r\nsoldier and royalist, who, however, was not yet marshal of France, was\r\nbeginning to organize, under the name of Brotherhood of the Holy Spirit,\r\na secret society intended to renew the civil war “if it happened that\r\noccasion should offer for repressing and chastising them of the religion\r\ncalled Reformed.”  It was the League in its cradle.  At the same time,\r\nthe king had orders given for a speedy levy of six thousand Swiss, and\r\nan army-corps was being formed on the frontiers of Champagne.  The\r\nqueen-mother neglected no pains, no caresses, to hide from Conde the true\r\nmoving cause at the bottom of all these measures; and as “he was,” says\r\nthe historian Davila, “by nature very ready to receive all sorts of\r\nimpressions,” he easily suffered himself to be lulled to sleep.  One day,\r\nhowever, in June, 1567, he thought it about time to claim the fulfilment\r\nof a promise that had been made him at the time of the peace of\r\nAmboise of a post which would give him the rank and authority of\r\nlieutenant-general of the kingdom, as his late brother, the King of\r\nNavarre, had been; and he asked for the sword of constable which\r\nMontmorency, in consequence of his great age, seemed disposed to resign\r\nto the king. Catherine avoided giving any answer; but her favorite son,\r\nHenry, Duke of Anjou, who was as yet only sixteen, repudiated this idea\r\nwith so much haughtiness that Conde felt called upon to ask some\r\nexplanations; there was no longer any question of war with Spain or of\r\nan army to be got together.  “What, pray, will you do,” he asked, “with\r\nthe Swiss you are raising?”  The answer was, “We shall find good\r\nemployment for them.”\r\n\r\nIt is the failing of a hypocritical and lying policy, however able, that,\r\nif it do not succeed promptly, a moment arrives when it becomes\r\ntransparent and lets in daylight.  Even Conde could not delude himself\r\nany longer; the preparations were for war against the Reformers.  He\r\nquitted the court to take his stand again with his own party.  Coligny,\r\nD’Andelot, La Rochefoucauld, La Noue, and all the accredited leaders\r\namongst the Protestants, whom his behavior, too full of confidence or of\r\ncomplaisance towards the court, had shocked or disquieted, went and\r\njoined him.  In September, 1567, the second religious war broke out.\r\n\r\nIt was short, and not decisive for either party.  At the outset of the\r\ncampaign, success was with the Protestants; forty towns, Orleans,\r\nMontereau, Lagny, Montauban, Castres, Montpellier, Uzes, &c., opened\r\ntheir gates to them or fell into their hands.\r\n\r\nThey were within an ace of surprising the king at Monceaux, and he never\r\nforgot, says Montluc, that “the Protestants had made him do the stretch\r\nfrom Meaux to Paris at something more than a walk.”  It was around Paris\r\nthat Conde concentrated all the efforts of the campaign.  He had posted\r\nhimself at St. Denis with a small army of four thousand foot and two\r\nthousand horse.  The Constable de Montmorency commanded the royal army,\r\nhaving a strength of sixteen thousand foot and three thousand horse.\r\nAttempts were made to open negotiations; but the constable broke them off\r\nbrusquely, roaring out that the king would never tolerate two religions.\r\nOn the 10th of November, 1567, the battle began at St. Denis, and was\r\nfought with alternations of partial success and reverse, which spread joy\r\nand sadness through the two hosts in turn; but in resisting a charge of\r\ncavalry, led to victory by Conde, the constable fell with and under his\r\nhorse; a Scot called out to him to surrender; for sole response, the aged\r\nwarrior, “abandoned by his men, but not by his manhood,” says D’Aubigne,\r\nsmashed the Scot’s jaw with the pommel of his broken sword; and at the\r\nsame moment he fell mortally wounded by a shot through the body.  His\r\ndeath left the victory uncertain and the royal army disorganized.  The\r\ncampaign lasted still four months, thanks to the energetic perseverance\r\nof Coligny and the inexhaustible spirits of Conde, both of whom excelled\r\nin the art of keeping up the courage of their men.  “Where are you taking\r\nus now?” asked an ill-tempered officer one day.  “To meet our German\r\nallies,” said Conde.  “And suppose we don’t find them?”  “Then we will\r\nbreathe on our fingers, for it is mighty cold.”  They did at last, at\r\nPont-a-Mousson, meet the German re-enforcements, which were being brought\r\nup by Prince John Casimir, son of the elector-palatine, and which made\r\nConde’s army strong enough for him to continue the war in earnest.  But\r\nthese new comers declared that they would not march any farther unless\r\nthey were paid the hundred thousand crowns due to them.  Conde had but\r\ntwo thousand.  “Thereupon,” says La Noue, “was there nothing for it but\r\nto make a virtue of necessity; and he as well as the admiral employed all\r\ntheir art, influence, and eloquence to persuade every man to divest\r\nhimself of such means as he possessed for to furnish this contribution,\r\nwhich was so necessary.  They themselves were the first to set an\r\nexample, giving up their own silver plate.  .  .  .  Half from love and\r\nhalf from fear, this liberality was so general, that, down to the very\r\nsoldiers’ varlets, every one gave; so that at last it was considered a\r\ndisgrace to have contributed little.  When the whole was collected, it\r\nwas found to amount, in what was coined as well as in plate and gold\r\nchains, to more than eighty thousand livres, which came in so timely,\r\nthat without it there would have been a difficulty in satisfying the\r\nreiters.  .  .  .  Was it not a thing worthy of astonishment to see an\r\narmy, itself unpaid, despoiling itself of the little means it had of\r\nrelieving its own necessities and sparing that little for the\r\naccommodation of others, who, peradventure, scarcely gave them a thankee\r\nfor it?”  [_Memoires de La Noue, in the Petitot collection,_ 1st Series,\r\nt. xxxiv.  p. 207.]\r\n\r\nSo much generosity and devotion, amongst the humblest as well as the most\r\nexalted ranks of the army, deserved not to be useless: but it turned out\r\nquite differently.  Conde and Coligny led back to Paris their new army,\r\nwhich, it is said, was from eighteen to twenty thousand strong, and\r\nseemed to be in a condition either to take Paris itself, or to force the\r\nroyal army to enter the field and accept a decisive battle.  To bring\r\nthat about, Conde thought the best thing was to besiege Chartres, “the\r\nkey to the granary of Paris,” as it was called, and “a big thorn,”\r\n according to La Noue, “to run into the foot of the Parisians.”  But\r\nCatherine de’ Medici had quietly entered once more into negotiations with\r\nsome of the Protestant chiefs, even with Conde himself.  Charles IX.\r\npublished an edict in which he distinguished between heretics and rebels,\r\nand assured of his protection all Huguenots who should lay down arms.\r\nChartres seemed to be on the point of capitulating, when news came that\r\npeace had just been signed at Longjumeau, on the 23d of March.  The king\r\nput again in force the edict of Amboise of 1563, suppressing all the\r\nrestrictions which had been tacked on to it successively.  The Prince of\r\nConde and his adherents were reinstated in all their possessions,\r\noffices, and honors; and Conde was “held and reputed good relative,\r\nfaithful subject, and servant of the king.”  The Reformers had to\r\ndisband, restore the new places they had occupied, and send away their\r\nGerman allies, to whom the king undertook to advance the hundred thousand\r\ngold crowns which were due to them.  He further promised, by a secret\r\narticle, that he too would at a later date dismiss his foreign troops and\r\na portion of the French.\r\n\r\nThis news caused very various impressions amongst the Protestant camp and\r\npeople.  The majority of the men of family engaged in the war, who most\r\nfrequently had to bear the expense of it, desired peace.  The personal\r\nadvantages accruing to Conde himself--made it very acceptable to him.\r\nBut the ardent Reformers, with Coligny at their head, complained bitterly\r\nof others being lured away by fine words and exceptional favors, and not\r\nprosecuting the war when, to maintain it, there was so good an army and\r\nthe chances were so favorable.  A serious dispute took place between the\r\npacific negotiators and the malcontents.  Chancellor de l’Hospital wrote,\r\nin favor of peace, a discourse on the pacific settlement of the troubles\r\nof the year 1567, containing the necessary causes and reasons of the\r\ntreaty, together with the means of reconciling the two parties to one\r\nanother, and keeping them in perpetual concord; composed by a high\r\npersonage, true subject, and faithful servant of the French crown.  But,\r\nif the chancellor’s reasons were sound, the hopes he hung upon them were\r\nextravagant; the parties were at that pitch of passion at which reasoning\r\nis in vain against impressions, and promises are powerless against\r\nsuspicions.  Concluded “through the vehemence of the desire to get home\r\nagain,” as La Noue says, the peace of Longjumeau was none the less known\r\nas the little peace, the patched-up peace, the lame and rickety peace;\r\nand neither they who wished for it nor they who spurned it prophesied its\r\nlong continuance.\r\n\r\nScarcely six months having elapsed, in August, 1568, the third religious\r\nwar broke out.  The written guarantees given in the treaty of Longjumeau\r\nfor security and liberty on behalf of the Protestants were misinterpreted\r\nor violated.  Massacres and murders of Protestants became more numerous,\r\nand were committed with more impunity than ever: in 1568 and 1569, at\r\nAmiens, at Auxerre, at Orleans, at Rouen, at Bourges, at Troyes, and at\r\nBlois, Protestants, at one time to the number of one hundred and forty or\r\none hundred and twenty, or fifty-three, or forty, and at another singly,\r\nwith just their wives and children, were massacred, burned, and hunted by\r\nthe excited populace, without any intervention on the part of the\r\nmagistrates to protect them or to punish their murderers.  The\r\ncontemporary Protestant chroniclers set down at ten thousand the number\r\nof victims who perished in the course of these six months, which were\r\ncalled a time of peace: we may, with De Thou, believe this estimate to be\r\nexaggerated; but, without doubt, the peace of Longjumeau was a lie, even\r\nbefore the war began again.\r\n\r\nDuring this interval Conde was living in Burgundy, at Noyers, a little\r\nfortress he possessed through his wife, Frances of Orleans, and Coligny\r\nwas living not far from Noyers, at Tanlay, which belonged to his brother\r\nD’Andelot.  They soon discovered, both of them, not only what their party\r\nhad to suffer, but what measures were in preparation against themselves.\r\nAgents went and sounded the depth of the moats of Noyers, so as to report\r\nupon the means of taking the place.  The queen-mother had orders given to\r\nGaspard de Tavannes to surround the Prince of Conde at Noyers.  “The\r\nqueen is counselled by passion rather than by reason,” answered the old\r\nwarrior; “I am not the sort of man to succeed in this ill-planned\r\nenterprise of distaff and pen; if her Majesty will be pleased to declare\r\nopen war, I will show how I understand my duty.”  Shocked at the\r\ndishonorable commands given him, Tavannes resolved to indirectly raise\r\nConde’s apprehensions, in order to get him out of Burgundy, of which he,\r\nTavannes, held the governorship; and he sent close past the walls of\r\nNoyers bearers of letters containing these words: “The stag is in the\r\ntoils; the hunt is ready.”  Conde had the bearers arrested, understood\r\nthe warning, and communicated it to Coligny, who went and joined him at\r\nNoyers, and they decided, both of them, upon quitting Burgundy without\r\ndelay, to go and seek over the Loire at La Rochelle, which they knew to\r\nbe devoted to their cause, a sure asylum and a place suitable for their\r\npurposes as a centre of warlike operations.  They set out together on the\r\n24th of August, 1568.  Conde took with him his wife and his four\r\nchildren, two of tender age.  Coligny followed him in deep mourning; he\r\nhad just lost his wife, Charlotte de Laval, that worthy mate of his, who,\r\nsix years previously, in a grievous crisis for his soul as well as his\r\ncause, had given him such energetic counsels: she had left him one young\r\ndaughter and three little children, the two youngest still in the nurse’s\r\narms.  His sister-in-law, Anne do Salm, wife of his brother D’Andelot,\r\nwas also there with a child of two years, whilst her husband was scouring\r\nAnjou and Brittany to rally the friends of his cause and his house.  A\r\nhundred and fifty men, soldiers and faithful servants, escorted these\r\nthree noble and pious families, who were leaving their castles to go and\r\nseek liberties and perils in a new war.  When they arrived at the bank of\r\nthe Loire, they found all points in the neighborhood guarded; the river\r\nwas low; and a boatman pointed out to them, near Sancerre, a possible\r\nford.  Conde went over first, with one of his children in his arms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Conde at the Ford---328]\r\n\r\nThey all went over singing the psalm, _When Israel went out of Egypt,_\r\nand on the 16th of September, 1568, Conde entered La Rochelle.  “I fled\r\nas far as I could,” he wrote the next day, “but when I got here I found\r\nthe sea; and, inasmuch as I don’t know how to swim, I was constrained to\r\nturn my head round and gain the land, not with feet, but with hands.”  He\r\nassembled the burgesses of La Rochelle, and laid before them the pitiable\r\ncondition of the kingdom, the wicked designs of people who were their\r\nenemies as well as his own: he called upon them to come and help; he\r\npromised to be aidful to them in all their affairs, and, “as a pledge of\r\nmy good faith,” said he, “I will leave you my wife and children, the\r\ndearest and most precious jewels I have in this world.”  The mayor of La\r\nRochelle, La Haise, responded by offering him “lives and property in the\r\nname of all the citizens,” who confirmed this offer with an outburst of\r\npopular enthusiasm.  The Protestant nobles of Saintonge and Poitou\r\nflocked in.  A royal ally was announced; the Queen of Navarre, Jeanne\r\nd’Albret, was bringing her son Henry, fifteen years of age, whom she was\r\ntraining up to be Henry IV.  Conde went to meet them, and, on the 28th of\r\nSeptember, 1568, all this flower of French Protestantism was assembled at\r\nLa Rochelle, ready and resolved to commence the third religious war.\r\n\r\nIt was the longest and most serious of the four wars of this kind which\r\nso profoundly agitated France in the reign of Charles IX.  This one\r\nlasted from the 24th of August, 1568, to the 8th of August, 1570, between\r\nthe departure of Conde and Coligny for La Rochelle and the treaty of\r\npeace of St. Germain-en-Laye: a hollow peace, like the rest, and only two\r\nyears before the St. Bartholomew.  On starting from Noyers with Coligny,\r\nConde had addressed to the king, on the 23d of August, a letter and a\r\nrequest, wherein, “after having set forth the grievances of the\r\nReformers, he attributed all the mischief to the Cardinal of Lorraine,\r\nand declared that the Protestant nobles felt themselves constrained, for\r\nthe safety of the realm, to take up arms against that infamous priest,\r\nthat tiger of France, and against his accomplices.”  He bitterly\r\nreproached the Guises “with treating as mere policists, that is, men who\r\nsacrifice religion to temporal interests, the Catholics inclined to make\r\nconcessions to the Reformers, especially the Chancellor de l’Hospital and\r\nthe sons of the late Constable de Montmorency.”  The Guises, indeed, and\r\ntheir friends did not conceal their distrust of De l’Hospital, any more\r\nthan he concealed his opposition to their deeds and their designs.\r\nWhilst the peace of Longjumeau was still in force, Charles IX. issued a\r\ndecree interdicting all Reformers from the chairs of the University and\r\nthe offices of the judicature; L’Hospital refused to seal it: “God save\r\nus from the chancellor’s mass!” was the remark at court.  L’Hospital,\r\nconvinced that he would not succeed in preserving France from a fresh\r\ncivil war, made up his mind to withdraw, and go and live for some time at\r\nhis estate of Vignay [a little hamlet in the commune of Gironville, near\r\nEtampes, Seine-et-Oise].  The queen-mother eagerly took advantage of his\r\nwithdrawal to demand of him the seals, of which, she said, she might have\r\nneed daily.  L’Hospital gave them up at once, at the same time retaining\r\nhis title of chancellor, and letting the queen know “that he would take\r\npains to recover his strength in order to return to his post, if and when\r\nit should be the king’s and the queen’s pleasure.”  From his rural home\r\nhe wrote to his friends, “I am not downhearted because the violence of\r\nthe wicked has snatched from me the seals of the kingdom.  I have not\r\ndone as sluggards and cowards do, who hide themselves at the first show\r\nof danger, and obey the first impulses of fear.  As long as I was strong\r\nenough, I held my own.  Deprived of all support, even that of the king\r\nand the queen, who dared no longer defend me, I retired, deploring the\r\nunhappy condition of France.  Now I have other cares; I return to my\r\ninterrupted studies and to my children, the props of my old age and my\r\nsweetest delight.  I cultivate my fields.  The estate of Vignay seems to\r\nme a little kingdom, if any man may consider himself master of anything\r\nhere below.  .  .  .  I will tell you more; this retreat, which satisfies\r\nmy heart, also flatters my vanity; I like to imagine myself in the wake\r\nof those famous exiles of Athens or Rome whom their virtues rendered\r\nformidable to their fellow-citizens.  Not that I dare compare myself with\r\nthose great men, but I say to myself that our fortunes are similar.  I\r\nlive in the midst of a numerous family whom I love; I have books; I read,\r\nwrite, and meditate; I take pleasure in the games of my children; the\r\nmost frivolous occupations interest me.  In fine, all my time is filled\r\nup, and nothing would be wanting to my happiness if it were not for the\r\nawful apparition hard by which sometimes comes, bringing trouble and\r\ndesolation to my heart.”\r\n\r\nThis “apparition hard by” was war, everywhere present or imminent in the\r\ncentre and south-west of France, accompanied by all those passions of\r\npersonal hatred and vengeance which are characteristic of religious wars,\r\nand which add so much of the moral sufferings to the physical calamities\r\nof life.  L’Hospital, when sending the seals to the queen-mother, who\r\ndemanded them of him, considered it his bounden duty to give her without\r\nany mincing, and the king whom she governed, a piece of patriotic advice.\r\n“At my departure,” he says in his will and testament, “I prayed of the\r\nking and queen this thing, that, as they had determined to break the\r\npeace, and proceed by war against those with whom they had previously\r\nmade peace, and as they were driving me from the court because they had\r\nheard it said that I was opposed to and ill content with their\r\nenterprise, I prayed them, I say, that if they did not acquiesce in my\r\ncounsel, they would, at the very least, some time after they had glutted\r\nand satiated their hearts and their thirst with the blood of their\r\nsubjects, embrace the first opportunity that offered itself for making\r\npeace, before that things were reduced to utter ruin; for, whatever there\r\nmight be at the bottom of this war, it could not but be very pernicious\r\nto the king and the kingdom.”  During the two years that it lasted, from\r\nAugust, 1568, to August, 1570, the third religious war under Charles IX.\r\nentailed two important battles and many deadly faction-fights, which\r\nspread and inflamed to the highest pitch the passions of the two parties.\r\nOn the 13th of March, 1569, the two armies, both about twenty thousand\r\nstrong, and appearing both of them anxious to come to blows, met near\r\nJarnac, on the banks of the Charente; the royal army had for its chief\r\nCatherine de’ Medici’s third son, Henry, Duke of Anjou, advised by the\r\nveteran warrior Gaspard de Tavannes, and supported by the young Duke\r\nHenry of Guise, who had his father to avenge and his own spurs to win.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRY OF LORRAINE (DUKE OF GUISE)----332]\r\n\r\n  The Prince of Conde, with Admiral de Coligny for second, commanded the\r\nProtestant army.  We make no pretension to explain and discuss here the\r\nmilitary movements of that day, and the merits or demerits of the two\r\ngenerals confronted; the Duke of Aumale has given an account of them and\r\ncriticised them in his _Histoire des Princes de Conde,_ with a complete\r\nknowledge of the facts and with the authority that belongs to him.  “The\r\nencounter on the 13th of March, 1569, scarcely deserves,” he says, “to be\r\ncalled a battle; it was nothing but a series of fights, maintained by\r\ntroops separated and surprised, against an enemy which, more numerous to\r\nbegin with, was attacking with its whole force united.”.  A tragic\r\nincident at the same time gave this encounter an importance which it has\r\npreserved in history.  Admiral de Coligny, forced to make a retrograde\r\nmovement, had sent to ask the Prince of Conde for aid; by a second\r\nmessage he urged the prince not to make a fruitless effort, and to fall\r\nback himself in all haste.  “God forbid,” answered Conde, “that Louis de\r\nBourbon should turn his back to the enemy!” and he continued his march,\r\nsaying to his brother-in-law, Francis de la Rochefoucauld, who was\r\nmarching beside him, “My uncle has made a ‘clerical error’ (_pas de\r\nclerc,_ a slip); but the wine is drawn, and it must be drunk.”  On\r\narriving at the battle-field, whither he had brought with him but three\r\nhundred horse, at the very moment when, with this weak escort, he was\r\npreparing to charge the deep column of the Duke of Anjou, he received\r\nfrom La Rochefoucauld’s horse a kick which broke one of the bones of his\r\nleg; and he had already crushed an arm by a fall.  We will borrow from\r\nthe Duke of Aumale the glorious and piteous tale of this incident.\r\n“Conde turned round to his men-at-arms, and showing first his injured\r\nlimbs and then the device, ‘Sweet is danger for Christ and for\r\nfatherland!’ which fluttered upon his banner in the breeze, ‘Nobles of\r\nFrance,’ he cried, ‘this is the desired moment Remember in what plight\r\nLouis de Bourbon enters the battle for Christ and fatherland!’  Then,\r\nlowering his head, he charges with his three hundred horse upon the eight\r\nhundred lances of the Duke of Anjou.  The first shock of this charge was\r\nirresistible; such for a moment was the disorder amongst the Catholics\r\nthat many of them believed the day was lost; but fresh bodies of\r\nroyalists arrive one after another.  The prince has his horse killed\r\nunder him; and, in the midst of the confusion, hampered by his wounds, he\r\ncannot mount another.  In spite of all, his brave comrades do not desert\r\nhim; Soubise and a dozen of them, covered with wounds, are taken; an old\r\nman, named La Vergne, who had brought with him twenty-five sons or\r\nnephews, is left upon the field with fifteen of them, ‘all in a heap,’\r\nsays D’Aubigne.  Left almost alone, with his back against a tree, one\r\nknee upon the ground, and deprived of the use of one leg, Conde still\r\ndefends himself; but his strength is failing him; he sees two Catholic\r\ngentlemen to whom he had rendered service, Saint-Jean and D’Argence; he\r\ncalls to them, raises the vizor of his helmet, and holds out to them his\r\ngauntlets.  The two horsemen dismount, and swear to risk their lives to\r\nsave his.  Others join them, and are eager to assist the glorious\r\ncaptive.  Meanwhile the royal cavalry continues the pursuit; the\r\nsquadrons successively pass close by the group which has formed round\r\nConde.  Soon he spies the red cloaks of the Duke of Anjou’s guards.  He\r\npoints to them with his finger.  D’Argence understands him, and, ‘Hide\r\nyour face!’ he cries.  ‘Ah D’Argence, D’Argence, you will not save me,’\r\nreplies the prince.  Then, like Caesar, covering up his face, he awaited\r\ndeath the poor soul knew only too well the perfidious character of the\r\nDuke of Anjou, the hatred with which he was hunting him down, and the\r\nsanguinary orders he would give.  The guards had gone by when their\r\ncaptain, Montesquion, learned the name of this prisoner.  ‘Slay, slay,\r\nmordioux!’ he shouted; then suddenly wheeling his horse round, he returns\r\nat a gallop, and with a pistol-shot, fired from behind, shatters the\r\nhero’s skull.”  [_Histoire des Princes de Conde,_ by M. le Duc d’Aumale,\r\nt. ii.  pp. 65-72.]\r\n\r\nThe death of Conde gave to the battle of Jarnac an importance not its\r\nown.  A popular ditty of the day called that prince “the great enemy of\r\nthe mass.”  “His end,” says the Duke of Aumale, “was celebrated by the\r\nCatholics as a deliverance; a solemn Te Deum was chanted at court and in\r\nall the churches of France.  The flags taken were sent to Rome, where\r\nPope Pius IV. went with them in state to St. Peter’s.  As for the Duke of\r\nAnjou, he showed his joy and his baseness together by the ignoble\r\ntreatment he caused to be inflicted upon the remains of his vanquished\r\nrelative, a prince of the blood who had fallen sword in hand.  At the\r\nfirst rumor of Conde’s death, the Duke of Montpensier’s secretary,\r\nCoustureau, had been despatched from headquarters with Baron de Magnac to\r\nlearn the truth of the matter.  ‘We found him there,’ he relates, ‘laid\r\nupon an ass; the said sir baron took him by the hair of the head for to\r\nlift up his face, which he had turned towards the ground, and asked me if\r\nI recognized him.  But as he had lost an eye from his head, he was\r\nmightily disfigured; and I could say no more than it was certainly his\r\nfigure and his hair, and further than that I was unable to speak.’\r\nMeanwhile,” continues the Duke of Aumale, “the accounts of those present\r\nremoved all doubt; and the corpse, thus thrown across an ass, with arms\r\nand legs dangling, was carried to Jarnac, where the Duke of Anjou lodged\r\non the evening of the battle.  There the body of Conde was taken down\r\namidst the sobs of some Protestant prisoners, who kissed, as they wept,\r\nthe remains of their gallant chief.  This touching spectacle did not stop\r\nthe coarse ribaldry of the Duke of Anjou and his favorites; and for two\r\ndays the prince’s remains were left in a ground-floor room, there exposed\r\nto the injurious action of the air and, to the gross insults of the\r\ncourtiers.  The Duke of Anjou at last consented to give up the body of\r\nConde to the Duke of Longueville, his brother-in-law, who had it interred\r\nwith due respect at Vendome in the burial-place of his ancestors.”\r\n\r\nWhen in 1569 he thus testified, from a mixture of hatred and fear, an\r\nignoble joy at the death of Louis de Conde, the valiant chief of\r\nProtestantism, the Duke of Anjou did not foresee that, nearly twenty\r\nyears later, in 1588, when he had become Henry III., King of France, he\r\nwould also testify, still from a mixture of hatred and fear, the same\r\nignoble joy at sight of the corpse of Henry de Guise, the valiant chief\r\nof Catholicism, murdered by his order and in his palace.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Conde’s death was known at La Rochelle, the Queen of Navarre,\r\nJeanne d’Albret, hurried to Tonnay-Charente, whither the Protestant army\r\nhad fallen back; she took with her her own son Henry, fifteen years old,\r\nand Henry de Bourbon, the late Prince of Conde’s son, who was seventeen;\r\nand she presented both of them to the army.  The younger, the future\r\nHenry IV., stepped forward briskly.  “Your cause,” said he, “is mine;\r\nyour interests are mine; I swear on my soul, honor, and life, to be\r\nwholly yours.”  The young Conde took the same oath.  The two princes were\r\nassociated in the command, under the authority of Coligny, who was\r\nimmediately appointed lieutenant-general of the army.  For two years\r\ntheir double signature figured at the bottom of the principal official\r\nacts of the Reformed party; and they were called “the admiral’s pages.”\r\n On both of them Jeanne passionately enjoined union between themselves,\r\nand equal submission on their part to Coligny, their model and their\r\nmaster in war and in devotion to the common cause.  Queen, princes,\r\nadmiral, and military leaders of all ranks stripped themselves of all the\r\ndiamonds, jewels, and precious stones which they possessed, and which\r\nElizabeth, the Queen of England, took in pledge for the twenty thousand\r\npounds sterling she lent him.  The Queen of Navarre reviewed the army,\r\nwhich received her with bursts of pious and warlike enthusiasm; and\r\nleaving to Coligny her two sons, as she called them, she returned alone\r\nto La Rochelle, where she received a like reception from the inhabitants,\r\n“rough and loyal people,” says La Noue, “and as warlike as mercantile.”\r\n After her departure, a body of German horse, commanded by Count Mansfeld,\r\njoined Coligny in the neighborhood of Limoges.  Their arrival was an\r\nunhoped-for aid.  Coligny distributed amongst them a medal bearing the\r\neffigy of Queen Jeanne of Navarre with this legend: “Alone, and with the\r\nrest, for God, the king, the laws, and peace.”\r\n\r\nWith such dispositions on one side and the other, war was resumed and\r\npushed forward eagerly from June, 1569, to June, 1570, with alternations\r\nof reverse and success.  On the 23d of June, 1569, a fight took place at\r\nRoche l’Abeille, near St. Yrieix in Limousin, wherein the Protestants had\r\nthe advantage.  The young Catholic noblemen, with Henry de Guise at their\r\nhead, began it rashly, against the desire of their general, Gaspard de\r\nTavannes, to show off their bravery before the eyes of the queen-mother\r\nand the Cardinal of Lorraine, both of whom considered the operations of\r\nthe army too slow and its successes too rare.  They lost five hundred men\r\nand many prisoners, amongst others Philip Strozzi, whom Charles IX. had\r\njust made colonel-general of the infantry.  They took their revenge on\r\nthe 7th of September, 1569, by forcing Coligny to raise the siege of\r\nPoitiers, which he had been pushing forward for more than two months, and\r\non the 3d of October following, at the battle of Moncontour in Poitou,\r\nthe most important of the campaign, which they won brilliantly, and in\r\nwhich the Protestant army lost five or six thousand men and a great part\r\nof their baggage.  Before the action began, “two gentlemen on the side of\r\nthe Catholics, being in an out-of-the-way spot, came to speech,” says La\r\nNoue, “with some of the (Protestant) religion, there being certain\r\nditches between them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Parley before the Battle of Moncontour----337]\r\n\r\n‘Sirs,’ said they, ‘we bear the marks of enemies, but we do not hate you\r\nin any wise, or your party.  Warn the admiral to be very careful not to\r\nfight, for our army is marvellously strong by reason of re-enforcements\r\nthat have come in to it, and it is very determined withal.  Let the\r\nadmiral temporize for a month only, for all the nobles have sworn and\r\nsaid to Monseigneur that they will not wait any longer, that he must\r\nemploy them within that time, and they will then do their duty.  Let the\r\nadmiral remember that it is dangerous to stem the fury of Frenchmen, the\r\nwhich, however, will suddenly ooze away; if they have not victory\r\nspeedily, they will be constrained to make peace, and will offer it you\r\non advantageous terms.  Tell him that we know this from a good source,\r\nand greatly desired to advertise him of it.’  Afterwards they retired.\r\nThe others,” continues La Noue, “went incontinently to the admiral for to\r\nmake their report, which was to his taste.  They told it also to others\r\nof the principals; and some there were who desired that it should be\r\nacted upon; but the majority opined that this notice came from suspected\r\npersons, who had been accustomed to practise fraud and deceit, and that\r\nno account should be made of it.”  The latter opinion prevailed; and the\r\nbattle of Moncontour was fought with extreme acrimony, especially on the\r\npart of the Catholics, who were irritated by the cruelties, as La Noue\r\nhimself says, which the Protestants had but lately practised at the fight\r\nof La Roche l’Abeille.  Coligny was wounded in the action, after having\r\nkilled with his own hand the Marquis Philibert of Baden; and the melley\r\nhad been so hot that the admiral’s friends found great difficulty in\r\nextricating him and carrying him off the field to get his wound attended\r\nto.  Three weeks before the battle, on the 13th of September, Coligny had\r\nbeen sentenced to death by the Parliament of Paris, and hanged in effigy\r\non the Place de Greve; and a reward of fifty thousand gold crowns had\r\nbeen offered to whosoever should give him up to the king’s justice dead\r\nor alive, words added, it is said, to the decree at the desire of Charles\r\nIX. himself.  Family sorrows were in Coligny’s case added to political\r\nreverses; on the 27th of May, in this same year 1569, he had lost his\r\nbrother D’Andelot, his faithful comrade in his religious as well as his\r\nwarlike career.  “He found himself,” says D’Aubigne, “saddled with the\r\nblame due to accident, his own merits being passed over in silence; with\r\nthe remnant of an army which, when it was whole, was in despair even\r\nbefore the late disaster; with weak towns, dismayed garrisons, and\r\nforeigners without baggage; himself moneyless, his enemies very powerful,\r\nand pitiless towards all, especially towards him; abandoned by all the\r\ngreat, except one woman, the Queen of Navarre, who, having nothing but\r\nthe title, had advanced to Niort in order to lend a hand to the afflicted\r\nand to affairs in general.  This old man, worn down by fever, endured all\r\nthese causes of anguish and many others that came to rack him more\r\npainfully than his grievous wound.  As he was being borne along in a\r\nlitter, Lestrange, an old nobleman, and one of his principal counsellors,\r\ntravelling in similar fashion, and wounded likewise, had his own litter,\r\nwhere the road was broad, moved forward in front of the admiral’s, and\r\nputting his head out at the door, he looked steadily at his chief,\r\nsaying, with tears in his eyes, ‘Yet God is very merciful.’  Thereupon\r\nthey bade one another farewell, perfectly at one in thought, without\r\nbeing able to say more.  This great captain confessed to his intimates\r\nthat these few friendly words restored him, and set him up again in the\r\nway of good thoughts and firm resolutions for the future.”  He was so\r\nmuch restored, that, between the end of 1569 and the middle of 1570, he\r\nmarched through the south and the centre of France the army which he had\r\nreorganized, and with which, wherever he went, he restored, if not\r\nsecurity, at any rate confidence and zeal, to his party.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Arnay-le-Duc, in Burgundy, he found himself confronted by\r\nMarshal de Cosse with thirteen thousand men of the king’s troops.\r\nColigny had barely half as many; but he did not hesitate to attack, and\r\non the 13th of June, 1570, he was so near victory that the road was left\r\nopen before him.  On the 7th of July he arrived at Charite-sur-Loire.\r\nAlarm prevailed at Paris.  A truce for ten days was signed, and\r\nnegotiations were reopened for a fresh attempt at peace.\r\n\r\n“If any one, in these lamentable wars, worked hard, both with body and\r\nmind,” says La Noue, “it may be said to have been the admiral, for, as\r\nregards the greatest part of the burden of military affairs and\r\nhardships, it was he who supported them with much constancy and buoyancy;\r\nand he was as respectful in his bearing towards the princes his superiors\r\nas he was modest towards his inferiors.  He always had piety in singular\r\nesteem, and a love of justice, which made him valued and honored by them\r\nof the party which he had embraced.  He did not seek ambitiously for\r\ncommands and honors; they were thrust upon him because of his competence\r\nand his expertness.  When he handled arms and armies, he showed that he\r\nwas very conversant with them, as much so as any captain of his day, and\r\nhe always exposed himself courageously to danger.  In difficulties, he\r\nwas observed to be full of magnanimity and resource in getting out of\r\nthem, always showing himself quite free from swagger and parade.  In\r\nshort, he was a personage worthy to re-establish an enfeebled and a\r\ncorrupted state.  I was fain to say these few words about him in passing,\r\nfor, having known him and been much with him, and having profited by his\r\nteaching, I should have been wrong if I had not made truthful and\r\nhonorable mention of him.”  [_Memoires de La Noue, in the Petitot\r\ncollection,_ 1st series, t. xxxiv.  p. 288.]\r\n\r\nThe negotiations were short.  The war had been going on for two years.\r\nThe two parties, victorious and vanquished by turns, were both equally\r\nsick of it.  In vain did Philip II., King of Spain, offer Charles IX. an\r\naid of nine thousand men to continue it.  In vain did Pope Pius V. write\r\nto Catherine de’ Medici, “As there can be no communion between Satan and\r\nthe children of the light, it ought to be taken for certain that there\r\ncan be no compact between Catholics and heretics, save one full of fraud\r\nand feint.”  “We have beaten our enemies,” says Montluc, “over and over\r\nagain; but notwithstanding that, they had so much influence in the king’s\r\ncouncil that the decrees were always to their advantage.  We won by arms,\r\nbut they won by those devils of documents.”  Peace was concluded at St.\r\nGermain-en-Laye on the 8th of August, 1570, and it was more equitable and\r\nbetter for the Reformers than the preceding treaties; for, besides a\r\npretty large extension as regarded free exercise of their worship and\r\ntheir civil rights in the state, it granted “for two years, to the\r\nprinces of Navarre and Conde and twenty noblemen of the religion, who\r\nwere appointed by the king, the wardenship of the towns of La Rochelle,\r\nCognac, Montauban, and La Charite, whither those of the religion who\r\ndared not return so soon to their own homes might retire.”  All the\r\nmembers of the Parliament, all the royal and municipal officers, and the\r\nprincipal inhabitants of the towns where the two religions existed were\r\nfurther bound over on oath “to maintenance of the edict.”\r\n\r\nPeace was made; but it was the third in seven years, and very shortly\r\nafter each new treaty civil war had recommenced.  No more was expected\r\nfrom the treaty of St. Germain-en-Laye than had been effected by those of\r\nAmboise and Longjumeau, and on both sides men sighed for something more\r\nstable and definitive.  By what means to be obtained and with what\r\npledges of durability?  A singular fact is apparent between 1570 and\r\n1572; there is a season, as it were, of marriages and matrimonial\r\nrejoicings.  Charles IX. went to receive at the frontier of his kingdom\r\nhis affianced bride, Archduchess Elizabeth of Austria, daughter of the\r\nemperor, Maximilian II., who was escorted by the Archbishop of Treves,\r\nchancellor of the empire; the nuptials were celebrated at Mezieres, on\r\nthe 26th of November, 1570; the princes and great lords of the Protestant\r\nparty were invited; they did not think it advisable to withdraw\r\nthemselves from their asylum at La Rochelle; but Coligny wrote to the\r\nqueen-mother to excuse himself, whilst protesting his forgetfulness of\r\nthe past and his personal devotion.  Four months afterwards, Coligny\r\nhimself married again; it was three years since he had lost his noble\r\nwife, Charlotte de Laval, and he had not contemplated anything of the\r\nkind, when, in the concluding weeks of 1570, he received from the castle\r\nof St. Andre de Briord, in Le Bugey, a letter from a great lady, thirty\r\nyears of age, Jacqueline de Montbel, daughter of Count d’Entremont,\r\nherself a widow, who wrote to him “that she would fain marry a saint and\r\na hero, and that he was that hero.”  “I am but a tomb,” replied Coligny.\r\nBut Jacqueline persisted, in spite of the opposition shown by her\r\nsovereign, Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, who did not like his fair\r\nsubjects to marry foreigners; and in February, 1571, she furtively\r\nquitted her castle, dropped down the Rhone in a boat as far as Lyons,\r\nmounted on horseback, and, escorted by five devoted friends, arrived at\r\nLa Rochelle.  All Coligny’s friends were urgent for him to accept this\r\npassionate devotion proffered by a lady who would bring him territorial\r\npossessions valuable to the Protestants, “for they were an open door to\r\nGeneva.”  Coligny accepted; and the marriage took place at La Rochelle on\r\nthe 24th of March, 1571.  “Madame Jacqueline wore, on this occasion,”\r\n says a contemporary chronicler, “a skirt in the Spanish fashion, of black\r\ngold-tissue, with bands of embroidery in gold and silver twist, and,\r\nabove, a doublet of white silver-tissue embroidered in gold, with large\r\ndiamond-buttons.”  She was, nevertheless, at that moment almost as poor as\r\nthe German arquebusiers who escorted her litter; for an edict issued by\r\nthe Duke of Savoy on the 31st of January, 1569, caused her the loss of\r\nall her possessions in her own country.  She was received in France with\r\nthe respect due to her; and when, five months after the marriage,\r\nCharles; IX. summoned Coligny to Paris, “to serve him in his most\r\nimportant affairs, as a worthy minister, whose virtues were sufficiently\r\nknown and tried,” he sent at the same time to Madame l’Amirale a\r\nsafe-conduct in which he called her my fair cousin.  Was there any one\r\nbelonging to that august and illustrious household who had, at that time,\r\na presentiment of their impending and tragic destiny?\r\n\r\nAt the same period, the Queen of Navarre, Jeanne d’Albret, obtained for\r\nher young nephew, Henry de Bourbon, Prince of Conde, son of the hero of\r\nJarnac, and companion of Henry of Navarre, the hand of his cousin, Mary\r\nof Cleves; and there was still going on in London, on behalf of one of\r\nCharles IX.’s brothers,--at one time the Duke of Anjou and at another the\r\nDuke of Alencon,--the negotiation which was a vain attempt to make Queen\r\nElizabeth espouse a French prince.\r\n\r\nCoincidently with all these marriages or projects of marriage amongst\r\nprinces and great lords came the most important of all, that which was to\r\nunite Henry of Navarre and Charles IX.’s sister, Marguerite de Valois.\r\nThere had already, thirteen or fourteen years previously, been some talk\r\nabout it, in the reign of King Henry II., when Henry of Navarre and\r\nMargaret de Valois, each born in 1553, were both of them mere babies.\r\nThis union between the two branches of the royal house, one Catholic and\r\nthe other Protestant, ought to have been the most striking sign and the\r\nsurest pledge of peace between Catholicism and Protestantism.  The\r\npolitical expediency of such a step appeared the more evident and the\r\nmore urgent in proportion as the religious war had become more direful\r\nand the desire for peace more general.  Charles IX. embraced the idea\r\npassionately.  At the outset he encountered an obstacle.  The young Duke\r\nof Guise had already paid court to Marguerite, and had obtained such\r\nmarked favor with her that the ambassador of Spain wrote to the king,\r\n“There is no public topic in France just now save the marriage of my Lady\r\nMarguerite with the Duke of Guise.”  People even talked of a tender\r\ncorrespondence between the princess and the duke, which was carried on\r\nthrough one of the queen’s ladies, the Countess of Mirandola, who was\r\ndevoted to the Guises and a favorite with Marguerite.  “If it be so,”\r\n said Charles IX., savagely, “we will kill him;” and he gave such\r\nperemptory orders on this subject, that Henry de Guise, somewhat\r\ndisquieted, avoided for a while taking part in the royal hunts, and\r\nthought it well that there should be resumed on his behalf a project of\r\nmarriage with Catherine of Cleves, widow of the Prince of Portien (Le\r\nPorcien) and the wealthy heiress to some great domains, especially the\r\ncountship of Eu.  So long as he had some hope of marrying Marguerite de\r\nValois, the Duke of Guise had repudiated, not without offensiveness, all\r\nidea of union with Catherine of Cleves.  “Anybody who can make me marry\r\nthe Princess of Portien,” said he, “could make me marry a negress.”  He,\r\nnevertheless, contracted this marriage, so greatly disdained, on the 4th\r\nof October, 1570; and at this price recovered the good graces of Charles\r\nIX.  The queen-mother charged the Cardinal Louis de Lorraine, him whom\r\nthe people called Cardinal Bottles (from his conviviality), to publicly\r\ngive the lie to any rumor of a possible engagement between her daughter\r\nMarguerite and Henry de Guise; and a grand council of the kings, after\r\nthree holdings, adopted in principle the marriage of Marguerite de Valois\r\nwith “the little Prince of Bearn.”\r\n\r\nCharles IX. at once set his hand to the work to turn this resolution to\r\ngood account, being the only means, he said, of putting a stop at last to\r\nthis incessantly renewed civil war, which was the plague of his life as\r\nwell as of his kingdom.  He first of all sent Marshal de Cosse to La\r\nRochelle, to sound Coligny as to his feelings upon this subject, and to\r\nurge him to thus cut short public woes and the Reformers’ grievances.\r\n“The king has always desired peace,” said the marshal; “he wishes it to\r\nbe lasting; he has proved only too well, to his own misery and that of\r\nhis people, that of all the evils which can afflict a state, the most\r\ndireful is civil war.  But what means this withdrawal, since the signing\r\nof peace at St. Germain, of the Queen of Navarre and her children, of the\r\nPrince of Conde, and so many lords and distinguished nobles, still\r\nseparated from their houses and their families, and collected together in\r\na town like Rochelle, which has great advantages by land and sea for all\r\nthose who would fain begin the troubles again?  Why have they not\r\nreturned home?  During the hottest part of the war, they ardently desired\r\nto see once more their houses, their wives, and their children; and now,\r\nwhen peace leaves them free to do so, they prefer to remain in a land\r\nwhich is in some sort foreign, and where, in addition to great expenses,\r\nthey are deprived of the conveniences they would find at home.  The king\r\ncannot make out such absurdity; or, rather, he is very apprehensive that\r\nthis long stay means the hatching of some evil design.”  The Protestants\r\ndefended themselves warmly against this supposition; they alleged, in\r\nexplanation of their persistent disquietude, the very imperfect execution\r\nof the conditions granted by the peace of St. Germain, and the insults,\r\nthe attacks which they had still to suffer in many parts of the kingdom,\r\nand quite recently at Rouen and at Orange.  The king attempted, without\r\nany great success, to repress these disorders amongst the populace.  The\r\nQueen of Navarre, the two princes, Coligny, and many Protestant lords\r\nremained still at La Rochelle, where was being held at this time a\r\ngeneral synod of the Reformed churches.  Charles IX. sent thither Marshal\r\nde Biron, with formal orders to negotiate the marriage of Marguerite de\r\nValois and the Prince of Navarre, and to induce that prince, his mother\r\nthe Queen of Navarre, and Coligny to repair to the court in order to\r\nconclude the matter.  The young prince was at that time in Warn.  The\r\nqueen, his mother, answered, “That she would consult her spiritual\r\nadvisers, and, as soon as her conscience was at rest, there were no\r\nconditions she would not accept with a view of giving satisfaction to the\r\nking and the queen, of marking her obedience and respect towards them,\r\nand of securing the tranquillity of the state, an object for which she\r\nwould willingly sacrifice her own life.  .  .  .  But,” she added, “I\r\nwould rather sink to the condition of the humblest damoisel in France\r\nthan sacrifice to the aggrandizement of my family my own soul and my\r\nson’s.”\r\n\r\nIn September, 1571, Charles IX. and the queen-mother repaired to Blois;\r\nand at their urgent request Coligny went thither to talk over the\r\nprojected marriage and the affairs of Europe.  The king received him with\r\nemotional satisfaction, calling him my father, and saying to him, “Now we\r\nhave you, and you shall not escape us when you wish to.”  Jeanne\r\nd’Albret, more distrustful, or, one ought rather to say, more\r\nclear-sighted, refused to leave La Rochelle, and continued to negotiate\r\nvaguely and from a distance.  Catherine de’ Medici insisted.  “Satisfy,”\r\n she wrote to her, “the extreme desire we have to see you in this company;\r\nyou will be loved and honored therein as accords with reason and with\r\nwhat you are.”  Jeanne still waited.  It was only in the following year,\r\nat the end of January, that, having earnestly exhorted her son “to remain\r\nBearn-wards whilst she was at the court of France,” she set out for\r\nBlois, where Charles IX. received her most affectionately, calling her my\r\ngood aunt, my dear aunt, and lavishing upon her promises as well as\r\nendearments.  Jeanne was a strict and a judicious person; and the manners\r\nand proceedings of the court at Blois displeased her.  On the 8th of\r\nMarch, 1572, she wrote to her son, “I find it necessary to negotiate\r\nquite contrariwise to what I had expected and what had been promised me;\r\nI have no liberty to speak to the king or my Lady Marguerite, only to the\r\nqueen-mother, who treats me as if I were dirt.  .  .  .  Seeing, then,\r\nthat no advance is made, and that the desire is to make me hurry matters,\r\nand not conduct them orderly, I have thrice spoken thereof to the queen,\r\nwho does nothing but make a fool of me, and tell everybody the opposite\r\nof what I told her; in such sort that my friends find fault with me, and\r\nI know not how to bring her to book, for when I say to her, ‘Madame, it\r\nis reported that I said so-and-so to you,’ though it was she herself who\r\nreported it, she denies it flatly, and laughs in my face, and uses me in\r\nsuch wise that you might really say that my patience passes that of\r\nGriselda.  .  .  .  Thenceforward I have a troop of Huguenots, who come\r\nto converse with me, rather for the purpose of being spies upon me than\r\nof assisting me.  Then I have some of another humor, who hamper me no\r\nless, and who are religious hermaphrodites.  I defend myself as best I\r\nmay.  .  .  I am sure that if you only knew the trouble I am in, you\r\nwould have pity upon me, for they give me empty speeches and raillery\r\ninstead of treating with me gravely, as the matter deserves; in such sort\r\nthat I am bursting, because I am so resolved not to lose my temper that\r\nmy patience is a miracle to see.  .  .  .  I found your letter very much\r\nto my taste; I will show, it to my Lady Marguerite if I can.  She is\r\nbeautiful, and discreet, and of good demeanor, but brought up in the most\r\naccursed and most corrupt society that ever was.  I would not, for\r\nanything in the world, have you here to remain here.  That is why I\r\ndesire to get you married, and you and your wife withdraw from this\r\ncorruption; for though I believed it to be very great, I find it still\r\nmore so.  Here it is not the men who solicit the women; it is the women\r\nwho solicit the men.  If you were here, you would never escape without a\r\ngreat deal of God’s grace.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Admiral Gaspard de Coligny----346]\r\n\r\nSide by side with this motherly and Christianly scrupulous negotiation,\r\nColigny set on foot another, noble and dignified also, but even less in\r\nharmony with the habits and bent of the government which it concerned.\r\nThe puritan warrior was at the same time an ardent patriot: he had at\r\nheart the greatness of France as much as he had his personal creed; the\r\nreverses of Francis I. and the preponderance of Spain in Europe oppressed\r\nhis spirit with a sense of national decadence, from which he wanted\r\nFrance to lift herself up again.  The moment appeared to him propitious;\r\nlet the king ally himself with Queen Elizabeth of England, the Prince of\r\nOrange in the Low Countries, and the Protestant princes of Germany; here\r\nwas for France a certain guarantee of power in Europe, and at the same\r\ntime a natural opportunity for conquering Flanders, a possession so\r\nnecessary to her strength and her security.  But high above this policy,\r\nso thoroughly French, towered a question still more important than that\r\nof even the security and the grandeur of France; that was the partition\r\nof Europe between Catholicism and Protestantism; and it was in a country\r\nCatholic in respect of the great majority, and governed by a kingship\r\nwith which Catholicism was hereditary, that, in order to put a stop to\r\ncivil war between French Catholics and Protestants, Coligny pressed the\r\nking to put himself at the head of an essentially Protestant coalition,\r\nand make it triumphant in Europe.  This was, in the sixteenth century, a\r\npolicy wholly chimerical, however patriotic its intention may have been;\r\nand the French Protestant hero who recommended it to Charles IX. did not\r\nknow that Protestantism was on the eve of the greatest disaster it would\r\nhave to endure in France.\r\n\r\nA fact of a personal character tended to mislead Coligny.  By his renown,\r\nby the loftiness of his views, by the earnest gravity of his character\r\nand his language he had produced a great effect upon Charles IX., a young\r\nking of warm imagination and impressible and sympathetic temperament,\r\nbut, at the same time, of weak judgment.  He readily gave way, in\r\nColigny’s company, to outpourings which had all the appearance of perfect\r\nand involuntary frankness.  “Speaking one day to the admiral about the\r\ncourse of conduct to be adopted as to the enterprise against Flanders,\r\nand well knowing that the queen-mother lay under his suspicion, ‘My dear\r\nfather,’ said he, ‘there is one thing herein of which we must take good\r\nheed; and that is, that the queen, my mother, who likes to poke her nose\r\neverywhere, as you know, learn nothing of this enterprise, at any rate as\r\nregards the main spring of it, for she would spoil all for us.’  ‘As you\r\nplease, sir; but I take her to be so good a mother, and so devoted to the\r\nwelfare of your kingdom, that when she knows of it she will do nothing to\r\nspoil it.’  ‘You are mistaken, my dear father,’ said the king; ‘leave it\r\nto me only; I see quite well that you do not know my mother; she is the\r\ngreatest meddler in all the world.’”  Another time, when he was speaking\r\nlikewise to Teligny, Coligny’s son-in-law, about this enterprise against\r\nFlanders, the king said, “Wouldst have me speak to thee freely, Teligny?\r\nI distrust all these gentry; I am suspicious of Tavannes’ ambition;\r\nVieilleville loves nothing but good wine; Cosse is too covetous;\r\nMontmorency cares only for his hunting and hawking; the Count de Retz is\r\na Spaniard; the other lords of my court and those of my council are mere\r\nblockheads; my Secretaries of State, to hide nothing of what I think, are\r\nnot faithful to me; insomuch that, to tell the truth, I know not at what\r\nend to begin.”  This tone of freedom and confidence had inspired Coligny\r\nwith reciprocal confidence; he believed himself to have a decisive\r\ninfluence over the king’s ideas and conduct; and when the Protestants\r\ntestified their distrust upon this subject, he reproached them vehemently\r\nfor it; he affirmed the king’s good intentions and sincerity; and he\r\nconsidered himself in fact, said Catherine de’ Medici with temper,\r\n“a second king of France.”\r\n\r\nHow much sincerity was there about these outpourings of Charles IX. in\r\nhis intercourse with Coligny, and how much reality in the admiral’s\r\ninfluence over the king?  We are touching upon that great historical\r\nquestion which has been so much disputed: was the St. Bartholomew a\r\ndesign, long ago determined upon and prepared for, of Charles IX. and his\r\ngovernment, or an almost sudden resolution, brought about by events and\r\nthe situation of the moment, to which Charles IX. was egged on, not\r\nwithout difficulty, by his mother Catherine and his advisers?\r\n\r\nWe recall to mind here what was but lately said in this very chapter as\r\nto the condition of minds and morals in the sixteenth century, and as to\r\nthe tragic consequences of it.  Massacre, we add no qualifying term to\r\nthe word, was an idea, a habit, we might say almost a practice, familiar\r\nto that age, and one which excited neither the surprise nor the horror\r\nwhich are inseparable from it in our day.  So little respect for human\r\nlife and for truth was shown in the relations between man and man!  Not\r\nthat those natural sentiments, which do honor to the human race, were\r\ncompletely extinguished in the hearts of men; they reappeared here and\r\nthere as a protest against the vices and the crimes of the period; but\r\nthey were too feeble and too rare to struggle effectually against the\r\nsway of personal passions and interests, against atrocious hatreds and\r\nhopes, against intellectual aberrations and moral corruption.  To betray\r\nand to kill were deeds so common that they caused scarcely any\r\nastonishment, and that people were almost resigned to them beforehand.\r\nWe have cited fifteen or twenty cases of the massacres which in the reign\r\nof Charles IX., from 1562 to 1572, grievously troubled and steeped in\r\nblood such and such a part of France, without leaving any lasting traces\r\nin history.  Previously to the massacre called the St. Bartholomew, the\r\nmassacre of Vassy is almost the only one which received and kept its true\r\nname.  The massacre of Vassy was, undoubtedly, an accident, a deed not at\r\nall forecast or prepared for.  The St. Bartholomew massacre was an event\r\nfor a long time forecast and announced, promised to the Catholics and\r\nthrown out as a threat to the Protestants, written beforehand, so to\r\nspeak, in the history of the religious wars of France, but, nevertheless,\r\nat the moment at which it was accomplished, and in the mode of its\r\naccomplishment, a deed unexpected so far as the majority of the victims\r\nwere concerned, and a cause of contest even amongst its originators.\r\nAccordingly it was, from the very first, a subject of surprise and\r\nhorror, throughout Europe as well as in France; not only because of the\r\ntorrents of blood that were shed, but also because of the extraordinary\r\ndegree in which it was characterized by falsehood and ferocious hatred.\r\n\r\nWe will bring forward in support of this double assertion only such facts\r\nand quotations as appear to us decisive.\r\n\r\nIn 1565, Charles IX. and Catherine de’ Medici had an interview at Bayonne\r\nwith the Duke of Alba, representative of Philip II., to consult as to the\r\nmeans of delivering France from heretics.  “They agreed at last,” says\r\nthe contemporary historian Adriani [continuer of Guicciardini; he had\r\ndrawn his information from the _Journal of Cosmo de’ Medici,_ Grand Duke\r\nof Tuscany, who died in 1574], “in the opinion of the Catholic king, who\r\nthought that this great blessing could not have accomplishment save by\r\nthe death of all the chiefs of the Huguenots, and by a new edition, as\r\nthe saying was, of the Sicilian Vespers.  ‘Take the big fish,’ said the\r\nDuke of Alba, ‘and let the small fry go; one salmon is worth more than a\r\nthousand frogs.’  They decided that the deed should be done at Moulins in\r\nBourbonness, whither the king was to return.  The execution of it was\r\nafterwards deferred to the date of the St. Bartholomew, in 1572, at\r\nParis, because of certain suspicions which had been manifested by the\r\nHuguenots, and because it was considered easier and more certain to get\r\nthem all together at Paris than at Moulins.”\r\n\r\nCatherine de’ Medici charged Cardinal Santa Croce to assure Pope Pius V.\r\n“that she and her son had nothing more at heart than to get the admiral\r\nand all his confidants together some day and make a massacre (_un\r\nmacello_) of them; but the matter,” she said, “was so difficult that\r\nthere was no possibility of promising to do it at one time more than at\r\nanother.”\r\n\r\nLa Noue bears witness in his _Memoires_ to “the resolution taken at\r\nBayonne, with the Duke of Alba aiding, to exterminate the Huguenots of\r\nFrance and the beggars (_gueux_) of Flanders; whereof warning had been\r\ngiven by those about whom there was no doubt.  All these things, and many\r\nothers as to which I am silent, mightily waked up those,” he adds, “who\r\nhad no desire to be caught napping.  And I remember that the chiefs of\r\nthe religion held, within a short time, three meetings, as well at Valeri\r\nas at Chatillon, to deliberate upon present occurrences, and to seek out\r\nlegitimate and honorable expedients for securing themselves against so\r\nmuch alarm, without having recourse to extreme remedies.”\r\n\r\nDe Thou regards these facts as certain, and, after having added some\r\ndetails, he sums them all up in the words, “This is what passed at\r\nBayonne in 1565.”\r\n\r\nIn 1571, after the third religious war and the peace of\r\nSt. Germain-en-Laye, Marshal de Tavaunes wrote to Charles IX., “Peace\r\nhas a chance of lasting, because neither of the two parties is willing\r\nor able to renew open war; but, if one of the two sees quite a safe\r\nopportunity for putting a complete end to what is at the root of the\r\nquestion, this it will take; for to remain forever in the state now\r\nexisting is what nobody can or ought to hope for.  And there is no such\r\nnear approximation to a complete victory as to take the persons.  For to\r\nsurprise what they (the Reformers) hold, to put down their religion, and\r\nto break off all at once the alliances which support them--this is\r\nimpossible.  Thus there is no way but to take the chiefs all together\r\nfor to make an end of it.”\r\n\r\nNext year, on the 24th of August, 1572, when the St. Bartholomew broke\r\nout, Tavannes took care to himself explain what he meant in 1571 by those\r\nwords, to take the chiefs all together for to make an end of it.  Being\r\ninvested with the command in Paris, “he went about the city all day,”\r\n says Brantome, “and, seeing so much blood spilt, he said and shouted to\r\nthe people, ‘Bleed, bleed; the doctors say that bleeding is as good all\r\nthrough this month of August as in May.’”\r\n\r\nIn the year which preceded the outbreak of the massacre, when the\r\nmarriage of Marguerite de Valois with the Prince of Navarre was agreed\r\nupon, and Coligny was often present at court, sometimes at Blois and\r\nsometimes at Paris, there arose between the king and the queen-mother a\r\ndifference which there had been up to that time nothing to foreshadow.\r\nIt was plain that the union between the two branches, Catholic and\r\nProtestant, of the royal house and the patriotic policy of Coligny were\r\nfar more pleasing to Charles IX. than to his mother.\r\n\r\nOn the matrimonial question the king’s feeling was so strong that he\r\nexpressed it roughly.  Jeanne d’Albret having said to him one day that\r\nthe pope would make them wait a long while for the dispensation requested\r\nfor the marriage, “No, no, my clear aunt,” said the king; “I honor you\r\nmore than I do the pope, and I love my sister more than I fear him.  I am\r\nnot a Huguenot, but no more am I an ass.  If the pope has too much of his\r\nnonsense, I will myself take Margot by the hand and carry her off to be\r\nmarried in open conventicle.”  Toligny, for his part, was so pleased with\r\nthe measures that Charles IX. had taken in favor of the Low Countries in\r\ntheir quarrels with Philip II., and so confident himself of his influence\r\nover the king, that when Tavannes was complaining in his presence “that\r\nthe vanquished should make laws for the victors,” Coligny said to his\r\nface, “Whoever is not for war with Spain is not a good Frenchman, and has\r\nthe red cross inside him.”  The Catholics were getting alarmed and\r\nirritated.  The Guises and their partisans left the court.  It was near\r\nthe time fixed for the marriage of Henry of Navarre and Marguerite de\r\nValois; the new pope, Gregory XIII., who had at first shown more pliancy\r\nthan his predecessor Pius V., attached to the dispensation conditions to\r\nwhich neither the intended husband nor King Charles IX. himself was\r\ninclined to consent.  The Queen of Navarre, Jeanne d’Albret, who had gone\r\nto Paris in preparation for the marriage, had died there on the 8th of\r\nJune, 1572; a death which had given rise to very likely ill-founded\r\naccusations of poisoning.  “A princess,” says D’Aubigne, “with nothing of\r\na woman but the sex, with a soul full of everything manly, a mind fit to\r\ncope with affairs of moment, and a heart invincible in adversity.”  It\r\nwas in deep mourning that her son, become King of Navarre, arrived at\r\ncourt, attended by eight hundred gentlemen, all likewise in mourning.\r\n“But,” says Marguerite de Valois herself, “the nuptials took place a few\r\ndays afterwards with such triumph and magnificence as none others of my\r\nquality; the King of Navarre and his troop having changed their mourning\r\nfor very rich and fine clothes, and I being dressed royally, with crown\r\nand corset of tufted ermine, all blazing with crown-jewels, and the grand\r\nblue mantle with a train four ells long borne by three princesses, the\r\npeople choking one another down below to see us pass.”  The marriage was\r\ncelebrated on the 18th of August, by the Cardinal of Bourbon, in front of\r\nthe principal entrance of Notre-Dame.  When the Princess Marguerite was\r\nasked if she consented, she appeared to hesitate a moment; but King\r\nCharles IX. put his hand a little roughly on her head, and made her lower\r\nit in token of assent.  Accompanied by the king, the queen-mother, and\r\nall the Catholics present, Marguerite went to hear mass in the choir;\r\nHenry and his Protestant friends walked about the cloister and the nave;\r\nMarshal de Damville pointed out to Coligny the flags, hanging from the\r\nvaulted roof of Notre-Dame, which had been taken from the vanquished at\r\nthe battle of Moncontour.  “I hope,” said the admiral, “that they will\r\nsoon have others better suited for lodgement in this place.”  He was\r\nalready dreaming of victories over the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Charles IX. was beginning to hesitate.  He was quite willing\r\nto disconnect himself from the King of Spain, and even to incur his\r\ndispleasure, but not to be actively embroiled with him and make war upon\r\nhim; he could not conceal from himself that this policy, thoroughly\r\nFrench though it was, was considered in France too Protestant for a\r\nCatholic king.  Coligny urged him vehemently.  “If you want men,” he\r\nsaid, “I have ten thousand at your service;” whereupon Tavannes said to\r\nthe king, “Sir, whoever of your subjects uses such words to you, you\r\nought to have his head struck off.  How is it that he offers you that\r\nwhich is your own?  It is that he has won over and corrupted them, and\r\nthat he is a party-leader to your prejudice.”  Tavannes, a rough and\r\nfaithful soldier, did not admit that there could be amongst men moral\r\nties of a higher kind than political ties.  Charles IX., too weak in mind\r\nand character to think and act with independence and consistency in the\r\ngreat questions of the day, only sought how to elude them, and to leave\r\ntime, that inscrutable master, to settle them in his place.  His\r\nindecision brought him to a state of impotence, and he ended by inability\r\nto do anything but dodge and lie, like his mother, and even with his\r\nmother.  Whilst he was getting his sister married to the King of Navarre\r\nand concerting his policy with Coligny, he was adopting towards the three\r\nprincipal personages who came to talk over those affairs with him three\r\ndifferent sorts of language; to Cardinal Alessandrino, whom Pope Pius V.\r\nhad sent to him to oppose the marriage, he said, “My lord cardinal, all\r\nthat you say to me is sound; I acknowledge it, and I thank the pope and\r\nyou for it; if I had any other means of taking vengeance on my enemies,\r\nI would not make this marriage; but I have no other.”  With Jeanne\r\nd’Albret, he lauded himself for the marriage as the best policy he could\r\npursue.  “I give my sister,” he said, “not to the Prince of Navarre, but\r\nto all the Huguenots, to marry them as it were, and take from them all\r\ndoubt as to the unchangeable fixity of my edicts.”  And to humor his\r\nmother Catherine, he said to her, on the very evening of his interview\r\nwith Jeanne d’Albret, “What think you, madam?  Do I not play my partlet\r\nwell?”  “Yes, very well; but it is nothing if it is not continued.”  And\r\nCharles continued to play his part, even after the Bartholomew was over,\r\nfor he was fond of saying with a laugh, “My big sister Margot caught all\r\nthose Huguenot rebels in the bird-catching style.  What has grieved me\r\nmost is being obliged to dissimulate so long.”\r\n\r\nHis contemporary Catholic biographer, Papirius Masson, who was\r\ntwenty-eight years old at the time of the St. Bartholomew, says of him,\r\n“He is impatient in waiting, ferocious in his fits of anger, skilfully\r\nmasked when he wishes, and ready to break faith as soon as that appears\r\nto his advantage.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Charles IX. and Catherine de’ Medici----354]\r\n\r\nSuch was the prince, fiery and flighty, inconsistent and artful,\r\naccessible to the most opposite sympathies as well as hatreds, of whom\r\nCatherine de’ Medici and Admiral Coligny were disputing the possession.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1572 Coligny might have considered himself the victor in\r\nthis struggle; at his instance Charles IX. had written on the 27th of\r\nApril to Count Louis of Nassau, leader of the Protestant insurrection in\r\nHainault, “that he was determined, so far as opportunities and the\r\narrangements of his affairs permitted him, to employ the powers which God\r\nhad put into his hands for the deliverance of the Low Countries from the\r\noppression under which they were groaning.”  Fortified by this promise of\r\nthe king’s, Coligny had raised a body of French Protestants, and had sent\r\nit under the command of La Noue to join the army of Louis of Nassau.  The\r\nReformers had at first had some successes; they had taken Valenciennes\r\nand Mons; but the Duke of Alba restored the fortunes of the King of\r\nSpain; he re-entered Valenciennes and he was besieging Mons.  Coligny\r\nsent to the aid of that place a fresh body of French under the orders of\r\nSenlis, one of his comrades in faith and arms.  Before setting out,\r\nSenlis saw Charles IX., received from him money together with\r\nencouragement, and, in the corps he led, some Catholics were mixed with\r\nthe Protestants.  But from the very court of France there came to the\r\nDuke of Alba warnings which put him in a position to surprise the French\r\ncorps; and Senlis was beaten and made prisoner on the 10th of July.\r\n“I have in my hands,” the Duke of Alba sent word to his king, “a letter\r\nfrom the King of France which would strike you dumb if you were to see\r\nit; for the moment, it is expedient to say nothing about it.”  “News of\r\nthe defeat of Senlis,” says Tavannes, “comes flying to court, and changes\r\nhearts and counsels.  Disdain, despite, is engendered in the admiral, who\r\nhurls this defeat upon the heads of those who have prevented the king\r\nfrom declaring himself; he raises a new levy of three thousand foot, and,\r\nnot regarding who he is and where he is, he declares, in the presumption\r\nof his audacity, that he can no longer hold his partisans, and that it\r\nmust be one of two wars, Spanish or civil.  It is all thunder-storm at\r\ncourt; everyone remains on the watch at the highest pitch of resolution.”\r\n A grand council was assembled.  Coligny did not care.  He had already, at\r\nthe king’s request, set forth in a long memorial all the reasons for his\r\npolicy of a war with Spain; the king had appeared struck with them; but,\r\n“as he only sought,” says De Thou, “to gain time without its being\r\nperceived,” he handed the admiral’s memorial to the keeper of the seals,\r\nJohn de Morvilliers, requesting him to set forth also all the reasons for\r\na pacific policy.  Coligny, a man of resolution and of action, did not\r\ntake any pleasure in thus prolonging the discussion; nevertheless he\r\nagain brought forward and warmly advocated, at the grand council, the\r\nviews he had so often expressed.  They were almost unanimously rejected.\r\nColigny did not consider himself bound to give them up.  “I have\r\npromised,” said he, “on my own account, my assistance to the Prince of\r\nOrange; I hope the king will not take it ill if by means of my friends,\r\nand perhaps in person, I fulfil my promise.”  This reservation excited\r\ngreat surprise.  “Madam,” said Coligny to the queen-mother, “the king is\r\nto-day shunning a war which would promise him great advantages; God\r\nforbid that there should break out another which he cannot shun!”  The\r\ncouncil broke up in great agitation.  “Let the queen beware,” said\r\nTavannes, “of the king her son’s secret councils, designs, and sayings;\r\nif she do not look out, the Huguenots will have him.  At any rate, before\r\nthinking of anything else, let her exert herself to regain the mother’s\r\nauthority which the admiral has caused her to lose.”\r\n\r\nThe king was hunting at Brie.  The queen-mother went and joined him; she\r\nshut herself up with him in a cabinet, and, bursting into tears, she\r\nsaid, “I should never have thought that, in return for having taken so\r\nmuch pains to bring you up and preserve to you the crown, you would have\r\nhad heart to make me so miserable a recompense.  You hide yourself from\r\nme, me who am your mother, in order to take counsel of your enemies.  I\r\nknow that you hold secret counsels with the admiral; you desire to plunge\r\nrashly into war with Spain, in order to give your kingdom, yourself, and\r\nthe persons that are yours, over as a prey to them of the religion.  If I\r\nam so miserable a creature, yet before I see that, give me leave to\r\nwithdraw to the place of my birth; remove from you your brother, who may\r\ncall himself unfortunate in having employed his own life to preserve\r\nyours; give him at least time to withdraw out of danger and from the\r\npresence of enemies made in doing you service; Huguenots who desire not\r\nwar with Spain, but with France, and the subversion of all the Estates in\r\norder to set up themselves.”\r\n\r\nTavannes himself terms these expressions “an artful harangue;” but he\r\nsays, “it moved, astounded, and dismayed the king, not so much on the\r\nscore of the Huguenots as of his mother and brother, whose subtlety,\r\nambition, and power in the state he knew; he marvelled to see his\r\ncounsels thus revealed; he avowed them, asked pardon, promised obedience.\r\nHaving sown this distrust, having shot this first bolt, the queen-mother,\r\nstill in displeasure, withdrew to Monceaux.  The trembling king followed\r\nher; he found her with his brother and Sieurs de Tavannes, de Retz, and\r\nthe Secretary of State de Sauve, the last of whom threw himself upon his\r\nknees and received his Majesty’s pardon for having revealed his counsels\r\nto his mother.  The infidelity, the bravado, the audacity, the menaces,\r\nand the enterprises of the Huguenots were magnified with so much of truth\r\nand art that from friends behold them converted into enemies of the king,\r\nwho, nevertheless, wavering as ever, could not yet give up the desire he\r\nhad conceived of winning glory and reputation by war with Spain.”\r\n\r\nA fresh incident increased the agitation in the royal circle.  In July,\r\n1572, the throne of Poland had become vacant.  A Polish embassy came to\r\noffer it to the Duke of Anjou.  On his part and his mother’s, there was\r\nat first great eagerness to accept it; Catherine was charmed to see her\r\nfavorite son becoming a king.  “If we had required,” says a Polish\r\nhistorian, “that the French should build a bridge of solid gold over the\r\nVistula, they would have agreed.”  Hesitation soon took the place of\r\neagerness; Henry demanded information, and took time to reply.  He had\r\nshown similar hesitation at the time of the negotiations entered upon in\r\nLondon, in 1571, with a view of making him the husband of Elizabeth,\r\nQueen of England: Coligny, who was very anxious to have him away, pressed\r\nCharles IX. to insist upon a speedy solution.  “If Monsieur,” said he,\r\n“who would not have England by marriage, will not have Poland either by\r\nelection, let him declare once for all that he will not leave France.”\r\n The relations between the two brothers became day by day more\r\nuncomfortable: two years later, Henry, for a brief period King of Poland,\r\nhimself told the story of them to his physician Miron.  “When, by any\r\nchance,” he said, “the queen-mother and I, after the admiral’s departure,\r\napproached the king to speak to him of any matters, even those which\r\nconcerned merely his pleasure, we found him marvellously quick-tempered\r\nand cross-grained, with rough looks and bearing, and his answers still\r\nmore so.  One day, a very short time before the St. Bartholomew, setting\r\nout expressly from my quarters to go and see the king, somebody told me\r\non inquiry that he was in his cabinet, whence the admiral, who had been\r\nalone with him a very long while, had just that instant gone out.  I\r\nentered at once, as I had been accustomed to do.  But as soon as the king\r\nmy brother perceived me, he, without saying anything to me, began walking\r\nabout furiously and with long steps, often looking towards me askance and\r\nwith a very evil eye, sometimes laying his hand upon his dagger, and in\r\nso excited a fashion that I expected nothing else but that he would come\r\nand take me by the collar to poniard me.  I was very vexed that I had\r\ngone in, reflecting upon the peril I was in, but still more upon how to\r\nget out of it; which I did so dexterously, that, whilst he was walking\r\nwith his back turned to me, I retreated quickly towards the door, which I\r\nopened, and, with a shorter obeisance than at my entry, I made my exit,\r\nwhich was scarcely perceived by him until I was outside.  And straightway\r\nI went to look for the queen my mother; and, putting together all\r\nreports, notifications, and suspicions, the time, and past circumstances,\r\nin conjunction with this last meeting, we remained both of us easily\r\npersuaded, and as it were certain, that it was the admiral who had\r\nimpressed the king with some bad and sinister opinion of us, and we\r\nresolved from that moment to rid ourselves of him.”\r\n\r\nOne idea immediately occurred to Catherine and her son.  Two persons felt\r\na passionate hatred towards Coligny; they were the widow of Duke Francis\r\nof Guise, Anne d’Este, become Duchess of Nemours by a second marriage,\r\nand her son Henry de Guise, a young man of twenty-two.  They were both\r\nconvinced that Coligny had egged on Poltrot to murder Duke Francis, and\r\nthey had sworn to exact vengeance.  Being informed of the queen-mother’s\r\nand the Duke of Anjou’s intention, they entered into it eagerly; the\r\nyoung Duke of Guise believed his mother quite capable of striking down\r\nthe admiral in the very midst of one of the great assemblies at court;\r\nthe fair ladies of the sixteenth century were adepts in handling dagger\r\nand pistol.  In default of the Duchess of Nemours, her son was thought of\r\nfor getting rid of Coligny.  “It was at one time decided,” says the Duke\r\nde Bouillon in his Memoires, “that M. de Guise should kill the admiral\r\nduring a tilt-at-the-ring which the king gave in the garden of the\r\nLouvre, and in which all Messieurs were to lead sides.  I was on that of\r\nthe duke, who was believed to have an understanding with the admiral.  On\r\nthis occasion, it was so managed that our dresses were not ready, and the\r\nlate duke and his side did not tilt at all.  The resolution against the\r\nadmiral was changed prudently; inasmuch as it was very perilous, for the\r\nperson of the king and of Messieurs, to have determined to kill him in\r\nthat place, there being present more than four hundred gentlemen of the\r\nreligion, who might have gone very far in case of an assault upon that\r\nlord, who was so much beloved by them.”  Everything considered, it was\r\nthought more expedient to employ for the purpose an inferior agent;\r\nCatherine and the Duke of Anjou sent for a Gascon captain, a dependant of\r\nthe house of Lorraine, whom they knew to be resolute and devoted.\r\n“We had him shown the means he should adopt,” says the Duke of Anjou,\r\n“in attacking him whom we had in our eye; but, having well scanned him,\r\nhimself and his movements, and his speech and his looks, which had made\r\nus laugh and afforded us good pastime, we considered him too hare-brained\r\nand too much of a wind-bag to deal the blow well.”  They then applied to\r\nan officer “of practice and experience in murder,” Charles de Louviers,\r\nSieur de Maurevert, who was called the king’s slaughterman (_le tueur du\r\nroi_), because he had already rendered such a service, and they agreed\r\nwith him as to all the circumstances of place, time, and procedure most\r\nlikely to secure the success of the deed, whilst giving the murderer\r\nchances of escape.\r\n\r\nIn such situations there is scarcely any project the secret of which is\r\nso well kept that there does not get abroad some rumor to warn an\r\nobservant mind; and when it is the fate of a religious or a popular hero\r\nthat is in question, there is never any want of devoted friends or\r\nservants about him, ready to take alarm for him.  When Coligny mounted\r\nhis horse to go from Chatillon to Paris, a poor countrywoman on his\r\nestates threw herself before him, sobbing, “Ah! sir, ah! our good master,\r\nyou are going to destruction; I shall never see you again if once you go\r\nto Paris; you will die there, you and all those who go with-you.”  At\r\nParis, on the approach of the St. Bartholomew, the admiral heard that\r\nsome of his gentlemen were going away.  “They treat you too well here,”\r\n said one of them, Langoiran, to him; “better to be saved with the fools\r\nthan lost for the sake of being thought over-wise.”  “The admiral was\r\nbeset by letters which reminded him of the queen-mother’s crooked ways,\r\nand the detestable education of the king, trained to every sort of\r\nviolence and horrible sin; his Bible is Macchiavelli; he has been\r\nprepared by the blood of beasts for the shedding of human blood; he has\r\nbeen persuaded that a prince is not bound to observe an edict extorted by\r\nhis subjects.”  To all these warnings Coligny replied at one time by\r\naffirming the king’s good faith, and at another by saying, “I would\r\nrather be dragged dead through the muck-heaps of Paris than go back to\r\ncivil war.”  This great soul had his seasons, not of doubt as to his\r\nfaith or discouragement as to his cause, but of profound sorrow at the\r\natrocious or shameful spectacles and the public or private woes which had\r\nto be gone through.\r\n\r\nCharles IX. himself felt some disquietude as to the meeting of the Guises\r\nand Coligny at his court.  The Guises had quitted it before the 18th of\r\nAugust, the day fixed for the marriage of King Henry of Navarre with\r\nMarguerite de Valois.  When the marriage was over, they were to return,\r\nand they did.  At the moment of their returning, the king said to\r\nColigny, with demonstrations of the most sincere friendship, “You know,\r\nmy dear father, the promise you made me not to insult any of the Guises\r\nas long as you remained at court.  On their side, they have given me\r\ntheir word that they will have for you, and all the gentry of your\r\nfollowing, the consideration you deserve.  I rely entirely upon your\r\nword, but I have not so much confidence in theirs; I know that they are\r\nonly looking for an opportunity of letting their vengeance burst forth; I\r\nknow their bold and haughty character; as they have the people of Paris\r\ndevoted to them, and as, on coming hither, under pretext of the\r\nrejoicings at my sister’s marriage, they have brought a numerous body of\r\nwell-armed soldiers, I should be inconsolable if they were to take\r\nanything in hand against you; such an outrage would recoil upon me.  That\r\nbeing so, if you think as I do, I believe the best thing for me is to\r\norder into the city the regiment of guards, with such and such captains\r\n(he mentioned none but those who were not objects of suspicion to\r\nColigny); this re-enforcement,” added the king, “will secure public\r\ntranquillity, and, if the factious make any disturbance, there will be\r\nmen to oppose to them.”  The admiral assented to the king’s proposal.  He\r\nadded that he was ready to declare “that never had he been guilty or\r\napproving of the death of Duke Francis of Guise, and that he set down as\r\na calumniator and a scoundrel whoever said, that he had authorized it.”\r\n Though frequently going to the palace, both he and the Guises, they had\r\nnot spoken when they met.  Charles had promised the Lorraine princes “not\r\nto force them to make friends with Coligny more than was agreeable to\r\nthem.”  He believed that he had taken every precaution necessary to\r\nmaintain in his court, for some time at least, the peace he desired.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, the 22d of August, 1572, Coligny was returning on foot from\r\nthe Louvre to the Rue des Fosses--St.-Germain-l’Auxerrois, where he\r\nlived; he was occupied in reading a letter which he had just received;\r\na shot, fired from the window of a house in the cloister of\r\nSt. Germain-l’Auxerrois, smashed two fingers of his right hand and\r\nlodged a ball in his left arm; he raised his eyes, pointed out with his\r\ninjured hand the house whence the shot had come, and reached his\r\nquarters on foot.  Two gentlemen who were in attendance upon him rushed\r\nto seize the murderer; it was too late; Maurevert had been lodging there\r\nand on the watch for three days at the house of a canon, an old tutor to\r\nthe Duke of Guise; a horse from the duke’s stable was waiting for him at\r\nthe back of the house; and, having done his job, he departed at a\r\ngallop.  He was pursued for several leagues without being overtaken.\r\n\r\nColigny sent to apprise the king of what had just happened to him.\r\n“There,” said he, “was a fine proof of fidelity to the agreement between\r\nhim and the Duke of Guise.”  “I shall never have rest, then!” cried\r\nCharles, breaking the stick with which he was playing tennis with the\r\nDuke of Guise and Teligny, the admiral’s son-in-law; and he immediately\r\nreturned to his room.  The Duke of Guise took himself off without a word.\r\nTeligny speedily joined his father-in-law.  Ambrose Pare had already\r\nattended to him, cutting off the two broken fingers; somebody expressed a\r\nfear that the balls might have been poisoned.  “It will be as God pleases\r\nas to that,” said Coligny; and, turning towards the minister, Merlin, who\r\nhad hurried to him, he added, “pray that He may grant me the gift of\r\nperseverance.”  Towards midday, Marshals de Damville, De Cosse, and De\r\nVillars went to see him “out of pure friendship,” they told him, “and not\r\nto exhort him to endure his mishap with patience: we know that you will\r\nnot lack patience.”  “I do protest to you,” said Coligny, “that death\r\naffrights me not; it is of God that I hold my life; when He requires it\r\nback from me, I am quite ready to give it up.  But I should very much\r\nlike to see the king before I die; I have to speak to him of things which\r\nconcern his person and the welfare of his state, and which I feel sure\r\nnone of you would dare to tell him of.”  “I will go and inform his\r\nMajesty, .  .  .”  rejoined Damville; and he went out with Villars and\r\nTeligny, leaving Marshal de Cosse in the room.  “Do you remember,” said\r\nColigny to him, “the warnings I gave you a few hours ago?  You will do\r\nwell to take your precautions.”\r\n\r\nAbout two P. M., the king, the queen-mother, and the Dukes of Anjou and\r\nAlencon, her two other sons, with many of their high officers, repaired\r\nto the admiral’s.  “My dear father,” said the king, as he went in, “the\r\nhurt is yours; the grief and the outrage mine; but I will take such\r\nvengeance that it shall never be forgotten;” to which he added his usual\r\nimprecations.  “Then the admiral, who lay in bed sorely wounded,” says\r\nthe Duke of Anjou himself, in his account of this interview, “requested\r\nthat he might speak privately to the king, which the king granted\r\nreadily, making a sign to the queen my mother, and to me, to withdraw,\r\nwhich we did incontinently into the middle of the room, where we remained\r\nstanding during this secret colloquy, which caused us great misgiving.\r\nWe saw ourselves surrounded by more than two hundred gentlemen and\r\ncaptains of the admiral’s party, who were in the room and another\r\nadjoining, and, besides, in a ball below, the which, with sad faces and\r\nthe gestures and bearing of malcontents, were whispering in one another’s\r\nears, frequently passing and repasssing before and behind us, not with so\r\nmuch honor and respect as they ought to have done, and as if they had\r\nsome suspicion that we had somewhat to do with the admiral’s hurt.  We\r\nwere seized with astonishment and fear at seeing ourselves shut in there,\r\nas my mother has since many times confessed to me, saying that she had\r\nnever been in any place where there was so much cause for fright, and\r\nwhence she had gone away with more relief and pleasure.  This\r\napprehension caused us to speedily break in upon the conversation the\r\nadmiral was having with the king, under a polite excuse invented by the\r\nqueen my mother, who, approaching the king, said out loud that she had no\r\nidea he would make the admiral talk so much, and that she saw quite well\r\nthat his physicians and surgeons considered it bad for him, as it\r\ncertainly was very dangerous, and enough to throw him into a fever, which\r\nwas, above everything, to be guarded against.  She begged the king to put\r\noff the rest of their conversation to another time, when the admiral was\r\nbetter.  This vexed the king mightily, for he was very anxious to hear\r\nthe remainder of what the admiral had to say to him.  However, he being\r\nunable to gainsay so specious an argument, we got the king away.  And\r\nincontinently the queen-mother (and I too) begged the king to let us know\r\nthe secret conversation which the admiral had held with him, and in which\r\nhe had been unwilling that we should be participators; which the king\r\nrefused several times to do.  But finding himself importuned and hard\r\npressed by us, he told us abruptly and with displeasure, swearing by\r\nGod’s death that what the admiral said was true, that kings realized\r\nthemselves as such in France only in so far as they had the ‘power of\r\ndoing harm or good to their subjects and servants, and that this power\r\nand management of affairs had slipped imperceptibly into the hands of the\r\nqueen my mother and mine.’  ‘This superintendent domination, the admiral\r\ntold me, might some day be very prejudicial to me and to all my kingdom,\r\nand that I should hold it in suspicion and beware of it; of which he was\r\nanxious to warn me, as one of my best and most faithful subjects, before\r\nhe died.  There, God’s death, as you wish to know, is what the admiral\r\nsaid to me.’  This, said as it was with passion and fury, went straight\r\nhome to our hearts, which we concealed as best we might, both of us,\r\nhowever, defending ourselves in the matter.  We continued this\r\nconversation all the way from the admiral’s quarters to the Louvre,\r\nwhere, having left the king in his room, we retired to that of the queen\r\nmy mother, who was piqued and hurt to the utmost degree at this language\r\nused by the admiral to the king, as well as at the credence which the\r\nking seemed to accord to it, and was fearful lest it should bring about\r\nsome change and alteration in our affairs and in the management of the\r\nstate.  Being unable to resolve upon any course at the moment, we\r\nretired, putting off the question till the morrow, when I went to see my\r\nmother, who was already up.  I had a fine racket in my head, and so had\r\nshe, and for the time there was no decision come to save to have the\r\nadmiral despatched by some means or other.  It being impossible any\r\nlonger to employ stratagems and artifices, it would have to be done\r\nopenly, and the king brought round to that way of thinking.  We agreed\r\nthat, in the afternoon, we would go and pay him a visit in his closet,\r\nwhither we would get the Sieur de Nevers, Marshals de Tavannes and de\r\nRetz, and Chancellor de Birague to come, merely to have their opinion as\r\nto the means to be adopted for the execution, which we had already\r\ndetermined upon, my mother and I.”\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, the 23d of August, in the afternoon, the queen-mother, the\r\nDuke of Anjou, Marshals do Tavannes and de Retz, the Duke of Nevers, and\r\nthe Chancellor de Birague met in the king’s closet, who was irresolute\r\nand still talking of exacting from the Guises heavy vengeance for the\r\nmurderous attack upon Coligny.  Catherine “represented to him that the\r\nparty of the Huguenots had already seized this occasion for taking up\r\narms against him; they had sent,” she said, “several despatches to\r\nGermany to procure a levy of ten thousand reiters, and to the cantons of\r\nthe Swiss for another levy of ten thousand foot; the French captains,\r\npartisans of the Huguenots, had already, most of them, set out to raise\r\nlevies within the kingdom time and place of meeting had already been\r\nassigned and determined.  All the Catholics, on their side,” added\r\nCatherine, “disgusted with so long a war and harassed by so many kinds of\r\ncalamities, have resolved to put a stop to them; they have decided\r\namongst them to elect a captain-general, to form a league offensive and\r\ndefensive against the Huguenots.  The whole of France would thus be seen\r\narmed and divided into two great parties, between which the king would\r\nremain isolated, without any command and with about as much obedience.\r\nFor so much ruin and calamity in anticipation and already within a\r\nfinger’s reach, and for the slaughter of so many thousands of men, a\r\npreventive may be found in a single sword-thrust; all that is necessary\r\nis to kill the admiral, the head and front of all the civil wars; the\r\ndesigns and the enterprises of the Huguenots will die with him, and the\r\nCatholics, satisfied with the sacrifice of two or three men, will remain\r\nforever in obedience to the king.  .  .  .”  “At the beginning,” continues\r\nthe Duke of Anjou, in his account, “the king would not by any means\r\nconsent to have the admiral touched; feeling, however, some fear of the\r\ndanger which we had so well depicted and represented, to him, he desired\r\nthat, in a case of such importance, every one should at once state his\r\nopinion.”  When each of those present had spoken, the king appeared still\r\nundecided.  The queen-mother then resolved “to let him hear the truth in\r\ntoto from Marshal de Retz, from whom she knew that he would take it\r\nbetter than from any other,” says his sister Marguerite de Valois in her\r\nMemoires, “as one who was more in his confidence and favor than any\r\nother.  The which came to see him in the evening, about nine or ten, and\r\ntold him that, as his faithful servant, he could not conceal from him the\r\ndanger he was in if he were to abide by his resolution to do justice on\r\nM. de Guise, because it was necessary that he should know that the attack\r\nupon the admiral was not M. de Guise’s doing alone, but that my brother\r\nHenry, the King of Poland, afterwards King of France, and the queen my\r\nmother, had been concerned in it; which M. de Guise and his friends would\r\nnot fail to reveal, and which would place his Majesty in a position of\r\ngreat danger and embarrassment.”  Towards midnight, the queen-mother went\r\ndown to the king, followed by her son Henry and four other councillors.\r\nThey found the king more put out than ever.  The conversation began\r\nagain, and resolved itself into a regular attack upon the king.  “The\r\nGuises,” he was told, “will denounce the king himself, together with his\r\nmother and brother; the Huguenots will believe that the king was in\r\nconcert with the party, and they will take the whole royal family to\r\ntask.  War is inevitable.  Better to win a battle in Paris, where we hold\r\nall the chiefs in our clutches, than put it to hazard in the field.\r\nAfter a struggle of an hour and a half, Charles, in a violent state of\r\nagitation, still hesitated; when the queen-mother, fearing lest, if there\r\nwere further delay, all would be discovered, said to him, ‘Permit me and\r\nyour brother, sir, to retire to some other part of the kingdom.’  Charles\r\nrose from his seat.  ‘By God’s death,’ said he, ‘since you think proper\r\nto kill the admiral, I consent; but all the Huguenots in Paris as well,\r\nin order that there remain not one to reproach me afterwards.  Give the\r\norders at once.’”  And he went back into his room.\r\n\r\nIn order to relieve and satisfy her own passions and those of her\r\nfavorite son, which were fear and love of power, the queen-mother had\r\nsucceeded in working her king-son into a fit of weakness and mad anger.\r\nAnxious to profit by it, “she gave orders on the instant for the signal,\r\nwhich was not to have been given until an hour before daybreak,” says De\r\nThou, “and, instead of the bell at the Palace of Justice, the tocsin was\r\nsounded by the bell of St.-Germain-Auxerrois, which was nearer.”\r\n\r\nEven before the king had given his formal consent, the projectors of the\r\noutrage had carefully prepared for its execution; they had apportioned\r\nout amongst themselves or to their agents the different quarters of the\r\ncity.  The Guises had reserved for themselves that in which they\r\nconsidered they had personal vengeance as well as religious enmity to\r\nsatisfy, the neighborhood of St.-Germain-l’Auxerrois, and especially Rue\r\nde Bethisy and Rue des Fosses-St.-Germain.  Awakened by the noise around\r\nhis house, and, before long, by arquebuse-shots fired in his court-yard,\r\nColigny understood what was going to happen; he jumped out of bed, put on\r\nhis dressing-gown, and, as he stood leaning against the wall, he said to\r\nthe clergyman, Merlin, who was sitting up with him, “M. Merlin, say me a\r\nprayer; I commit my soul to my Saviour.”  One of his gentlemen, Cornaton,\r\nentered the room.  “What is the meaning of this riot?” asked Ambrose\r\nPare, who had also remained with the admiral.\r\n\r\n“My lord,” said Cornaton to Coligny, “it is God calling us.”  “I have\r\nlong been ready to die,” said the admiral; “but you, my friends, save\r\nyourselves, if it is still possible.”  All ran up stairs and escaped, the\r\nmajority by the roof; a German servant, Nicholas Muss, alone remained\r\nwith the admiral, “as little concerned,” says Cornaton, “as if there were\r\nnothing going on around him.”  The door of his room was forced.  Two men,\r\nservants of the Guises, entered first.  One of them, Behme, attached to\r\nthe Duke of Guise’s own person, came forward, saying, “Art thou not the\r\nadmiral?”  “Young man,” said Coligny, “thou comest against a wounded and\r\nan aged man.  Thou’lt not shorten my life by much.”  Behme plunged into\r\nhis stomach a huge pointed boar-spear which he had in his hand, and then\r\nstruck him on the head with it.  Coligny fell, saying, “If it were but a\r\nman!  But ‘tis a horse-boy.”  Others came in and struck him in their\r\nturn.  “Behme!” shouted the Duke of Guise from the court-yard, “hast\r\ndone?”  “‘Tis all over, my lord,” was the answer; and the murderers threw\r\nthe body out of the window, where it stuck for an instant, either\r\naccidentally or voluntarily, and as if to defend a last remnant of life.\r\nThen it fell.  The two great lords, who were waiting for it, turned over\r\nthe corpse, wiped the blood off the face, and said, “Faith, ‘tis he, sure\r\nenough.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Henry de Guise and the Corpse of Coligny----369]\r\n\r\nSome have said that Guise gave him a kick in the face.  A servant of the\r\nDuke of Nevers cut off the head, and took it to the queen-mother, the\r\nking, and the Duke of Anjou.  It was embalmed with care, to be sent, it\r\nis said, to Rome.  What is certain is that, a few days afterwards,\r\nMandelot, governor of Lyons, wrote to the king, “I have received, sir,\r\nthe letter your Majesty was pleased to write to me, whereby you tell me\r\nthat you have been advertised that there is a man who has set out from\r\nover yonder with the head he took from the admiral after killing him, for\r\nto convey it to Rome, and to take care, when the said man arrives in this\r\ncity, to have him arrested, and to take from him the said head.\r\nWhereupon I incontinently gave such strict orders, that, if he presents\r\nhimself, the command which it pleases your Majesty to lay upon me will be\r\nacted upon.  There hath not passed, for these last few days, by way of\r\nthis city, any person going Romewards save a squire of the Duke of\r\nGuise’s, named Paule, the which had departed four hours previously on the\r\nsame day on which I received the said letter from your Majesty.”\r\n\r\nWe do not find anywhere, in reference to this incident, any information\r\ngoing further than this reply of the governor of Lyons to Charles IX.\r\nHowever it may be, the remains of Coligny’s body, after having been hung\r\nand exposed for some days on the gibbet of Montfaucon, were removed by\r\nDuke Francis de Montmorency, the admiral’s relative and friend, who had\r\nthem transferred to Chantilly and interred in the chapel of the castle.\r\nAfter having been subjected, in the course of three centuries, at one\r\ntime to oblivion and at others to divers transferences, these sad relics\r\nof a great man, a great Christian, and a great patriot, have been\r\nresting, for the last two and twenty years, in the very castle of\r\nChatillon-sur-Loing, his ancestors’ own domain having once more become\r\nthe property of a relative of his family, the Duke of Luxembourg, to whom\r\nCount Anatole de Montesquiou transferred them, and who, in 1851, had them\r\nsealed up in a bit of wall in ruins, at the foot of an old tower, under\r\nthe site of the bed-chamber of the Duchesses of Chatillon, where, in all\r\nprobability, Coligny was born.  The more tardy the homage, the greater.\r\n\r\nThe actual murderers of Coligny, the real projectors of the\r\nSt. Bartholomew, Catherine de’ Medici and her son the Duke of Anjou, at\r\nthe very moment when they had just ordered the massacre, were seized with\r\naffright at the first sound of their crime.  The Duke of Anjou finishes\r\nhis story with this page “After but two hours’ rest during the night,\r\njust as the day was beginning to break, the king, the queen my mother,\r\nand I went to the frontal of the Louvre, adjoining the tennis-court, into\r\na room which looks upon the area of the stable-yard, to see the\r\ncommencement of the work.  We had not been there long when, as we were\r\nweighing the issues and the consequence of so great an enterprise, on\r\nwhich, sooth to say, we had up to that time scarcely bestowed a thought,\r\nwe heard a pistol-shot fired.  I could not say in what spot, or whether\r\nit knocked over anybody; but well know I that the sound wounded all three\r\nof us so deeply in spirit that it knocked over our senses and judgment,\r\nstricken with terror and apprehension at the great troubles which were\r\nthen about to set in.  To prevent them, we sent a gentleman at once and\r\nwith all haste to M. de Guise, to tell him and command him expressly from\r\nus to retire into his quarters, and be very careful to take no steps\r\nagainst the admiral, this single command putting a stop to everything\r\nelse, because it had been determined that in no spot in the city should\r\nany steps be taken until, as a preliminary, the admiral had been killed.\r\nBut soon afterwards the gentleman returning told us that M. de Guise had\r\nanswered him that the command came too late, that the admiral was dead,\r\nand the work was begun throughout the rest of the city.  So we went back\r\nto our original determination, and let ourselves follow the thread and\r\nthe course of the enterprise.”\r\n\r\nThe enterprise, in fact, followed its thread and natural course without\r\nits being in the power of anybody to arrest or direct it.  It had been\r\nabsolutely necessary to give information of it the evening before to the\r\nprovost of tradesmen of Paris, Le Charron, president in the court of\r\ntaxation (Board of Excise), and to the chief men of the city.  According\r\nto Brantome, “they made great difficulties and imported conscience into\r\nthe matter; but M. de Tavannes, in the king’s presence, rebuked them\r\nstrongly, and threatened them that, if they did not make themselves busy,\r\nthe king would have them hanged.  The poor devils, unable to do aught\r\nelse, thereupon answered, ‘Ha! is that the way you take it, sir, and you,\r\nmonsieur?  We swear to you that you shall hear news thereof, for we will\r\nply our hands so well right and left that the memory shall abide forever\r\nof a right well kept St. Bartholomew.’”  “Wherein they did not fail,”\r\n continues Brantome, “but they did not like it at first.”  According to\r\nother reports, the first opposition of the provost of tradesmen, Le\r\nCharron, was not without effect; it was not till the next day that he let\r\nthe orders he had received take their course; and it was necessary to\r\napply to his predecessor in his office, the ex-provost Marcel, a creature\r\nof the queen-mother’s, to set in motion the turbulent and the fanatical\r\namongst the populace, “which it never does to ‘blood,’ for it is\r\nafterwards more savage than is desirable.”  Once let loose upon the\r\nSt. Bartholomew, the Parisian populace was eager indeed, but not alone in\r\nits eagerness, for the work of massacre; the gentlemen of the court took\r\npart in it passionately, from a spirit of vengeance, from religious\r\nhatred, from the effect of smelling blood, from covetousness at the\r\nprospect of confiscations at hand.  Teligny, the admiral’s son-in-law,\r\nhad taken refuge on a roof; the Duke of Anjou’s guards make him a mark\r\nfor their arquebuses.  La Rochefoucauld, with whom the king had been\r\nlaughing and joking up to eleven o’clock the evening before, heard a\r\nknocking at his door, in the king’s name; it is opened; enter six men in\r\nmasks and poniard him.  The new Queen of Navarre, Marguerite de Valois,\r\nhad gone to bed by express order of her mother Catherine.  “Just as I was\r\nasleep,” says she, “behold a man knocking with feet and hands at the door\r\nand shouting, Navarre!  Navarre!  My nurse, thinking it was the king my\r\nhusband, runs quickly to the door and opens it.  It was a gentleman named\r\nM. de Leran, who had a sword-cut on the elbow, a gash from a halberd on\r\nthe arm, and was still pursued by four archers, who all came after him\r\ninto my bedroom.  He, wishing to save himself, threw himself on to my\r\nbed; as for me, feeling this man who had hold of me, I threw myself out\r\nof bed towards the wall, and he after me, still holding me round the\r\nbody.  I did not know this man, and I could not tell whether he had come\r\nthither to offer me violence, or whether the archers were after him in\r\nparticular, or after me.  We both screamed, and each of us was as much\r\nfrightened as the other.  At last it pleased God that M. de Nanqay,\r\ncaptain of the guards, came in, who, finding me in this plight, though he\r\nfelt compassion, could not help laughing; and, flying into a great rage\r\nwith the archers for this indiscretion, he made them begone, and gave me\r\nthe life of that poor man who had hold of me, whom I had put to bed and\r\nattended to in my closet, until he was well.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Queen of Navarre and the Huguenot----372]\r\n\r\nWe might multiply indefinitely these anecdotical scenes of the massacre,\r\nmost of them brutally ferocious, others painfully pathetic, some generous\r\nand calculated to preserve the credit of humanity amidst one of its most\r\ndireful aberrations.  History must show no pity for the vices and crimes\r\nof men, whether princes or people; and it is her duty as well as her\r\nright to depict them so truthfully that men’s souls and imaginations may\r\nbe sufficiently impressed by them to conceive disgust and horror at them;\r\nbut it is not by dwelling upon them and by describing them minutely, as\r\nif she had to exhibit a gallery of monsters and madmen, that history can\r\nlead men’s minds to sound judgments and salutary impressions; it is\r\nnecessary to have moral sense and good sense always in view, and set high\r\nabove great social troubles, just as sailors, to struggle courageously\r\nagainst the tempest, need to see a luminous corner where the sky is\r\nvisible, and a star which reveals to them the port.  We take no pleasure,\r\nand we see no use, in setting forth in detail the works of evil; we\r\nshould be inclined to fear that, by familiarity with such a spectacle,\r\nmen would lose the perception of good, and cease to put hope in its\r\nlegitimate and ultimate superiority.  Nor will we pause either to discuss\r\nthe secondary questions which meet us at the period of which we are\r\ntelling the story; for example, the question whether Charles IX. fired\r\nwith his own hand on his Protestant subjects whom he had delivered over\r\nto the evil passions of the aristocracy and of the populace, or whether\r\nthe balcony from which he is said to have indulged in this ferocious\r\npastime existed at that time, in the sixteenth century, at the palace of\r\nthe Louvre, and overlooking the Seine.  These questions are not without\r\nhistoric interest, and it is well for learned men to study them; but we\r\nconsider them incapable of being resolved with certainty; and, even were\r\nthey resolved, they would not give the key to the character of Charles\r\nIX. and to the portion which appertains to him in the deed of cruelty\r\nwith which his name remains connected.  The great historic fact of the\r\nSt. Bartholomew is what we confine ourselves to; and we have attempted to\r\ndepict it accurately as regards Charles IX.’s hesitations and equally\r\nfeverish resolutions, his intermixture of open-heartedness and\r\ndouble-dealing in his treatment of Coliguy, towards whom he felt himself\r\ndrawn without quite understanding him, and his puerile weakness in\r\npresence of his mother, whom he feared far more than he trusted.  When he\r\nhad plunged into the orgies of the massacre, when, after having said,\r\n“Kill them all!” he had seen the slaughter of his companions in his royal\r\namusements, Teligny and La Rochefoucauld, Charles IX. abandoned himself\r\nto a fit of mad passion.  He was asked whether the two young Huguenot\r\nprinces, Henry of Navarre and Henry de Conde, were to be killed also;\r\nMarshal de Retz had been in favor of it; Marshal de Tavannes had been\r\nopposed to it; and it was decided to spare them.  On the very night of\r\nthe St. Bartholomew, the king sent for them both.  “I mean for the\r\nfuture,” said he, “to have but one religion in my kingdom; the mass or\r\ndeath; make your choice.”  Henry of Navarre reminded the king of his\r\npromises, and asked for time to consider; Henry de Conde “answered that\r\nhe would remain firm in the true religion though he should have to give\r\nup his life for it.”  “Seditious madman, rebel, and son of a rebel,” said\r\nCharles, “if within three days you do not change your language, I will\r\nhave you strangled.”  At this first juncture, the king saved from the\r\nmassacre none but his surgeon, Ambrose Pare, and his nurse, both\r\nHuguenots; on the very night after the murder of Coligny, he sent for\r\nAmbrose Pare into his chamber, and made him go into his wardrobe, says\r\nBrantome, “ordering him not to stir, and saying that it was not\r\nreasonable that one who was able to be of service to a whole little world\r\nshould be thus massacred.”  A few days afterwards, “Now,” said the king\r\nto Pare, “you really must be a Catholic.”  “By God’s light,” answered\r\nPars, “I think you must surely remember, sir, to have promised me, in\r\norder that I might never disobey you, never, on the other hand, to bid me\r\ndo four things--find my way back into my mother’s womb, catch myself\r\nfighting in a battle, leave your service, or go to mass.”  After a\r\nmoment’s silence Charles rejoined, “Ambrose, I don’t know what has come\r\nover me for the last two or three days, but I feel my mind and my body\r\ngreatly excited, in fact, just as if I had a fever; meseems every moment,\r\njust as much waking as sleeping, that those massacred corpses keep\r\nappearing to me with their faces all hideous and covered with blood.  I\r\nwish the helpless and the innocent had not been included.”  “And in\r\nconsequence of the reply made to him,” adds Sully in his (_Economies\r\nroyales_ t. i.  p. 244, in the Petitot collection), “he next day issued\r\nhis orders, prohibiting, on pain of death, any slaying or plundering; the\r\nwhich were, nevertheless, very ill observed, the animosities and fury of\r\nthe populace being too much inflamed to defer to them.”\r\n\r\nThe historians, Catholic or Protestant, contemporary or researchful,\r\ndiffer widely as to the number of the victims in this cruel massacre;\r\naccording to De Thou, there were about two thousand persons killed in\r\nParis the first day; D’Aubigne says three thousand; Brantome speaks of\r\nfour thousand bodies that Charles IX. might have seen floating down the\r\nSeine; La Popeliniere reduces them to one thousand.  There is to be\r\nfound, in the account-books of the city of Paris, a payment to the\r\ngrave-diggers of the cemetery of the Innocents for having interred eleven\r\nhundred dead bodies stranded at the turns of the Seine near Chaillot,\r\nAuteuil, and St. Cloud; it is probable that many corpses were carried\r\nstill farther, and the corpses were not all thrown into the river.  The\r\nuncertainty is still greater when one comes to speak of the number of\r\nvictims throughout the whole of France; De Thou estimates it at thirty\r\nthousand, Sully at seventy thousand, Perefixe, Archbishop of Paris in the\r\nseventeenth century, raises it to one hundred thousand; Papirius Masson\r\nand Davila reduce it to ten thousand, without clearly distinguishing\r\nbetween the massacre of Paris and those of the provinces; other\r\nhistorians fix upon forty thousand.  Great uncertainty also prevails as\r\nto the execution of the orders issued from Paris to the governors at the\r\nprovinces; the names of the Viscount d’Orte, governor of Bayonne, and of\r\nJohn le Hennuyer, Bishop of Lisieux, have become famous from their having\r\nrefused to take part in the massacre; but the authenticity of the letter\r\nfrom the Viscount d’Orte to Charles IX. is disputed, though the fact of\r\nhis resistance appears certain; and as for the bishop, John le Hennuyer,\r\nM. de Formeville seems to us to have demonstrated in his _Histoire de\r\nl’ancien Eveche-comte de Lisieux_ (t. ii.  pp. 299-314), “that there was\r\nno occasion to save the Protestants of Lisieux, in 1572, because they did\r\nnot find themselves in any danger of being massacred, and that the merit\r\nof it cannot be attributed to anybody, to the bishop, Le Hennuyer, any\r\nmore than to Captain Fumichon, governor of the town.  It was only the\r\ngeneral course of events and the discretion of the municipal officers of\r\nLisieux that did it all.”  One thing which is quite true, and which it is\r\ngood to call to mind in the midst of so great a general criminality, is\r\nthat, at many spots in France, it met with a refusal to be associated in\r\nit; President Jeannin at Dijon, the Count de Tende in Provence, Philibert\r\nde la Guiche at Macon, Tanneguy le Veneur de Carrouge at Rouen, the Count\r\nde Gordes in Dauphiny, and many other chiefs, military or civil, openly\r\nrepudiated the example set by the murderers of Paris; and the municipal\r\nbody of Nantes, a very Catholic town, took upon this subject, as has been\r\nproved from authentic documents by M. Vaurigaud, pastor of the Reformed\r\nChurch at Nantes [in his _Essai sur l’Histoire des Eglises reformees de\r\nBretagne,_ t. i.  pp.  190-194], a resolution which does honor to its\r\npatriotic firmness as well as to its Christian loyalty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chancellor Michael de l’Hospital----376]\r\n\r\n\r\nA great, good man, a great functionary, and a great scholar, in disgrace\r\nfor six years past, the Chancellor Michael de l’Hospital, received about\r\nthis time, in his retreat at Vignay, a visit from a great philosopher,\r\nMichael de Montaigne, “anxious,” said the visitor, “to come and testify\r\nto you the honor and reverence with which I regard your competence and\r\nthe special qualities which are in you; for, as to the extraneous and the\r\nfortuitous, it is not to my taste to put them down in the account.”\r\n Montaigne chose a happy moment for disregarding all but the personal, and\r\nspecial qualities of the chancellor; shortly after his departure,\r\nL’Hospital was warned that some sinister-looking horsemen were coming,\r\nand that he would do well to take care of himself.  “No matter, no\r\nmatter,” he answered; “it will be as God pleases when my hour has come.”\r\n Next day he was told that those men were approaching his house, and he\r\nwas asked whether he would not have the gates shut against them, and have\r\nthem fired upon, in case they attempted to force an entrance.  “No,” said\r\nhe, “if the small gate will not do for them to enter by, let the big one\r\nbe opened.”  A few hours afterwards, L’Hospital was informed that the\r\nking and the queen-mother were sending other horsemen to protect him.\r\n“I didn’t know,” said the old man, “that I had deserved either death or\r\npardon.”  A rumor of his death flew abroad amongst his enemies, who\r\nrejoiced at it.  “We are told,” wrote Cardinal Granvelle to his agent at\r\nBrussels (October 8, 1572), “that the king has had Chancellor de\r\nl’Hospital and his wife despatched, which would be a great blessing.”\r\n The agent, more enlightened than his chief, denied the fact, adding,\r\n“They are a fine bit of rubbish left, L’Hospital and his wife.”  Charles\r\nIX. wrote to his old adviser to reassure him, “loving you as I do.”  Some\r\ntime after, however, he demanded of him his resignation of the title of\r\nchancellor, wishing to confer it upon La Birague, to reward him for his\r\nco-operation in the St. Bartholomew.  L’Hospital gave in his resignation\r\non the 1st of February, 1573, and died six weeks afterwards, on the 18th\r\nof March.  “I am just at the end of my long journey, and shall have no\r\nmore business but with God,” he wrote to the king and the queen-mother.\r\n“I implore Him to give you His grace, and to lead you with His hand in\r\nall your affairs, and in the government of this great and beautiful\r\nkingdom which He hath committed to your keeping, with all gentleness and\r\nclemency towards your good subjects, in imitation of Himself, who is good\r\nand, patient in bearing our burdens, and prompt to forgive you and pardon\r\nyou everything.”\r\n\r\nFrom the 24th to the 31st of August, 1572, the bearing and conduct of\r\nCharles IX. and the queen-mother produced nothing but a confused mass of\r\norders and counter-orders, affirmations and denials, words and actions\r\nincoherent and contradictory, all caused by a habit of lying and the\r\ndesire of escaping from the peril or embarrassment of the moment.  On the\r\nvery first day of the massacre, about midday, the provost of tradesmen\r\nand the sheriffs, who had not taken part in the “Paris matins,” came\r\ncomplaining to the king “of the pillage, sack, and murder which were\r\nbeing committed by many belonging to the suite of his Majesty, as well as\r\nto those of the princes, princesses, and lords of the court, by noblemen,\r\narchers, and soldiers of the guard, as well as by all sorts of gentry and\r\npeople mixed with them and under their wing.”  Charles ordered them “to\r\nget on horseback, take with them all the forces in the city, and keep\r\ntheir eyes open day and night to put a stop to the said murder, pillage,\r\nand sedition arising,” he said, “because of the rivalry between the\r\nhouses of Guise and Chatillon, and because they of Guise had been\r\nthreatened by the admiral’s friends, who suspected them of being at the\r\nbottom of the hurt inflicted upon him.”  He, the same day, addressed to\r\nthe governors of the provinces a letter in which he invested the\r\ndisturbance with the same character, and gave the same explanation of it.\r\nThe Guises complained violently at being thus disavowed by the king, who\r\nhad the face to throw upon them alone the odium of the massacre which he\r\nhad ordered.  Next day, August 25, the king wrote to all his agents, at\r\nhome and abroad, another letter, affirming that “what had happened at\r\nParis had been done solely to prevent the execution of an accursed\r\nconspiracy which the admiral and his allies had concocted against him,\r\nhis mother, and his brothers;” and, on the 26th of August, he went with\r\nhis two brothers to hold in state a bed of justice, and make to the\r\nParliament the same declaration against Coligny and his party.  “He could\r\nnot,” he said, “have parried so fearful a blow but by another very\r\nviolent one; and he wished all the world to know that what had happened\r\nat Paris had been done not only with his consent, but by his express\r\ncommand.”  Whereupon it was enjoined upon the court, says De Thou, “to\r\ncause investigations to be made as to the conspiracy of Coligny, and to\r\ndecree what it should consider proper, conformably with the laws and with\r\njustice.”  The next day but one, August 28, appeared a royal manifesto\r\nrunning, “The king willeth and intendeth that all noblemen and others\r\nwhosoever of the religion styled Reformed be empowered to live and abide\r\nin all security and liberty, with their wives, children, and families, in\r\ntheir houses, as they have heretofore done and were empowered to do by\r\nbenefit of the edicts of pacification.  And nevertheless, for to obviate\r\nthe troubles, scandals, suspicion, and distrust, which might arise by\r\nreason of the services and assemblies that might take place both in the\r\nhouses of the said noblemen and elsewhere, as is permitted by the\r\naforesaid edicts of pacification, his Majesty doth lay very express\r\ninhibitions and prohibitions upon all the said noblemen and others of the\r\nsaid religion against holding assemblies, on any account whatsoever,\r\nuntil that, by the said lord the king, after having provided for the\r\ntranquillity of his kingdom, it be otherwise ordained.  And that, on pain\r\nof confiscation of body and goods in case of disobedience.”\r\n\r\nThese tardy and lying accusations officially brought against Coligny and\r\nhis friends; these promises of liberty and security for the Protestants,\r\nrenewed in the terms of the edicts of pacification, and, in point of\r\nfact, annulled at the very moment at which they were being renewed; the\r\nmassacre continuing here and there in France, at one time with the secret\r\nconnivance and at another notwithstanding the publicly-given word of the\r\nking and the queen-mother; all this policy, at one and the same time\r\nviolent and timorous, incoherent and stubborn, produced amongst the\r\nProtestants two contrary effects: some grew frightened, others angry.\r\nAt court, under the direct influence of the king and his surroundings,\r\n“submission to the powers that be” prevailed; many fled; others, without\r\nabjuring their religion, abjured their party.  The two Reformer-princes,\r\nHenry of Navarre and Henry de Conde, attended mass on the 29th of\r\nSeptember, and, on the 3d of October, wrote to the pope, deploring their\r\nerrors and giving hopes of their conversion.  Far away from Paris, in the\r\nmountains of the Pyrenees and of Languedoc, in the towns where the\r\nReformers were numerous and confident, at Sancerre, at Montauban, at\r\nNimes, at La Rochelle, the spirit of resistance carried the day.  An\r\nassembly, meeting at Milhau, drew up a provisional ordinance for the\r\ngovernment of the Reformed church, “until it please God, who has the\r\nhearts of kings in His keeping, to change that of King Charles IX. and\r\nrestore the state of France to good order, or to raise up such\r\nneighboring prince as is manifestly marked out, by his virtue and by\r\ndistinguishing signs, for to be the liberator of this poor afflicted\r\npeople.”  In November, 1572, the fourth religious war broke out.  The\r\nsiege of La Rochelle was its only important event.  Charles IX. and his\r\ncouncillors exerted themselves in vain to avoid it.  There was everything\r\nto disquiet them in this enterprise: so sudden a revival of the religious\r\nwar after the grand blow they had just struck, the passionate energy\r\nmanifested by the Protestants in asylum at La Rochelle, and the help they\r\nhad been led to hope for from Queen Elizabeth, whom England would never\r\nhave forgiven for indifference in this cause.  Marshal de Biron, who was\r\nknown to favor the Reformers, was appointed governor of La Rochelle; but\r\nhe could not succeed in gaining admittance within the walls, even alone\r\nand for the purpose of parleying with the inhabitants.  The king heard\r\nthat one of the bravest Protestant chiefs, La Noue _Ironarm,_ had retired\r\nto Mons with Prince Louis of Nassau.  The Duke of Longueville, his old\r\nenemy, induced him to go to Paris.  The king received him with great\r\nfavor, gave up to him the property of Teligny, whose sister La Noue had\r\nmarried, and pressed him to go to La Rochelle and prevail upon the\r\ninhabitants to keep the peace.  La Noue refused, saying that he was not\r\nat all fitted for this commission.  The king promised that he would ask\r\nnothing of him which could wound his honor.  La Noue at last consented,\r\nand repaired, about the end of November, 1572, to a village close by La\r\nRochelle, whither it was arranged that deputies from the town would come\r\nand confer with him.  And they came, in fact, but at their first meeting,\r\n“We are come,” they said, “to confer with M. de La Noue, but we do not\r\nsee him here.”  La Noue got angry.  “I am astonished,” he said, “that you\r\nhave so soon forgotten one who has received so many wounds and lost an\r\narm fighting for you.”  “Yes, there is a M. de La Noue, who was one of\r\nus, and who bravely defended our cause; but he never flattered us with\r\nvain hopes, he never invited us to conferences to betray us.”  La Noue\r\ngot more fiercely angry.  “All I ask of you is, to report to the senate\r\nwhat I have to say to them.”  They complied, and came back with\r\npermission for him to enter the town.  The people looked at him, as he\r\npassed, with a mixture of distrust and interest.  After hearing him, the\r\nsenate rejected the pacific overtures made to them by La Noue.  “We have\r\nno mind to treat specially and for ourselves alone; our cause is that of\r\nGod and of all the churches of France; we will accept nothing but what\r\nshall seem proper to all our brethren.  For yourself, we give you your\r\nchoice between three propositions: remain in our town as a simple\r\nburgess, and we will give you quarters; if you like better to be our\r\ncommandant, all the nobility and the people will gladly have you for\r\ntheir head, and will fight with confidence under your orders; if neither\r\nof these propositions suits you, you shall be welcome to go aboard one of\r\nour vessels and cross over to England, where you will find many of your\r\nfriends.”  La Noue did not hesitate; he became, under the authority of\r\nthe mayor Jacques Henri, the military head of La Rochelle, whither\r\nCharles IX. had sent him to make peace.  The king authorized him to\r\naccept this singular position.  La Noue conducted himself so honorably in\r\nit, and everybody was so convinced of his good faith as well as bravery,\r\nthat for three months he commanded inside La Rochelle, and superintended\r\nthe preparations for defence, all the while trying to make the chances of\r\npeace prevail.  At the end of February, 1573, he recognized the\r\nimpossibility of his double commission, and he went away from La\r\nRochelle, leaving the place in better condition than that in which he had\r\nfound it, without either king or Rochellese considering that they had any\r\nright to complain of him.\r\n\r\nBiron first and then the Duke of Anjou in person took the command of the\r\nsiege.  They brought up, it is said, forty thousand men and sixty pieces\r\nof artillery.  The Rochellese, for defensive strength, had but twenty-two\r\ncompanies of refugees or inhabitants, making in all thirty-one hundred\r\nmen. The siege lasted from the 26th of February to the 13th of June,\r\n1573; six assaults were made on the place; in the last, the ladders had\r\nbeen set at night against the wall of what was called Gospel bastion; the\r\nDuke of Guise, at the head of the assailants, had escaladed the breach,\r\nbut there he discovered a new ditch and a new rampart erected inside;\r\nand, confronted by these unforeseen obstacles, the men recoiled and fell\r\nback.  La Rochelle was saved.  Charles IX. was more and more desirous of\r\npeace; his brother, the Duke of Anjou, had just been elected King of\r\nPoland; Charles IX. was anxious for him to leave France and go to take\r\npossession of his new kingdom.  Thanks to these complications, the peace\r\nof La Rochelle was signed on the 6th of July, 1573.  Liberty of creed and\r\nworship was recognized in the three towns of La Rochelle, Montauban, and\r\nNimes.  They were not obliged to receive any royal garrison, on condition\r\nof giving hostages to be kept by the king for two years.  Liberty of\r\nworship throughout the extent of their jurisdiction continued to be\r\nrecognized in the case of lords high-justiciary.  Everywhere else the\r\nReformers had promises of not being persecuted for their creed, under the\r\nobligation of never holding an assembly of more than ten persons at a\r\ntime.  These were the most favorable conditions they had yet obtained.\r\n\r\nCertainly this was not what Charles IX. had calculated upon when he\r\nconsented to the massacre of the Protestants.  “Provided,” he had said,\r\n“that not a single one is left to reproach me.”  The massacre had been\r\naccomplished almost without any resistance but that offered by certain\r\ngovernors of provinces or towns, who had refused to take part in it.  The\r\nchief leader of French Protestantism, Coligny, had been the first victim.\r\nFar more than that, the Parliament of Paris had accepted the royal lie\r\nwhich accused Coligny of conspiring for the downfall of the king and the\r\nroyal house; a decree, on that very ground, sentenced to condemnation the\r\nmemory, the family, and the property of Coligny, with all sorts of\r\nrigorous, we should rather say atrocious, circumstances.  And after\r\nhaving succeeded so well against the Protestants, Charles IX. saw them\r\nrecovering again, renewing the struggle with him, and wresting from him\r\nsuch concessions as he had never yet made to them.  More than ever might\r\nhe exclaim, “Then I shall never have rest!”  The news that came to him\r\nfrom abroad was not more calculated to satisfy him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The St. Bartholomew----383]\r\n\r\nThe St. Bartholomew had struck Europe with surprise and horror; not only\r\namongst the princes and in the countries that were Protestant, in\r\nEngland, Scotland, and Northern Europe, but in Catholic Germany itself,\r\nthere was a very strong feeling of reprobation; the Emperor Maximilian\r\nII. and the Elector Palatine Frederic III., called the Pious, showed it\r\nopenly; when the Duke of Anjou, elected King of Poland, went through\r\nGermany to go and take possession of his kingdom, he was received at\r\nHeidelberg with premeditated coolness.  When he arrived at the gate of\r\nthe castle, not a soul went to meet him; alone he ascended the steps, and\r\nfound in the hall a picture representing the massacre of St. Bartholomew;\r\nthe elector called his attention to the portraits of the principal\r\nvictims, amongst others that of Coligny, and at table he was waited upon\r\nsolely by French Protestant refugees.  At Rome itself, in the midst of\r\nofficial satisfaction and public demonstrations of it exhibited by the\r\npontifical court, the truth came out, and Pope Gregory XIII. was touched\r\nby it when certain of my lords the cardinals who were beside him “asked\r\nwherefore he wept and was sad at so goodly a despatch of those wretched\r\nfolk, enemies of God and of his Holiness: ‘I weep,’ said the pope, ‘at\r\nthe means the king used, exceeding unlawful and forbidden of God, for to\r\ninflict such punishment; I fear that one will fall upon him, and that he\r\nwill not have a very long bout of it (will not live very long).  I fear,\r\ntoo, that amongst so many dead folk there died as many innocent as\r\nguilty.’” [_Brantome,_ t. iv.  p. 306.  He attributes this language to\r\nPope Pius V., who died four months before the St. Bartholomew.  Gregory\r\nXIII., elected May 15, 1572, was pope when the massacre took place.] Only\r\nthe King of Spain, Philip II., a fanatical despot, and pitiless\r\npersecutor, showed complete satisfaction at the event; and he offered\r\nCharles IX.  the assistance of his army, if he had need of it, against\r\nwhat there was remaining of heretics in his kingdom.\r\n\r\nCharles IX. had not mind or character sufficiently sound or sufficiently\r\nstrong to support, without great perturbation, the effect of so many\r\nviolent, repeated, and often contradictory impressions.  Catherine de\r\nMedici had brought up her three sons solely with a view of having their\r\nconfidence and implicit obedience.  “All the actions of the\r\nqueen-mother,” said the Venetian ambassador Sigismund Cavalli, who had\r\nfor a long while resided at her court, “have always been prompted and\r\nregulated by one single passion, the passion of ruling.”  Her son Charles\r\nhad yielded to it without an effort in his youth.  “He was accustomed to\r\nsay that, until he was five and twenty, he meant to play the fool; that\r\nis to say, to think of nothing but of enjoying his heyday; accordingly he\r\nshowed aversion for speaking and treating of business, putting himself\r\naltogether in his mother’s hands.  Now, he no longer thinks and acts in\r\nthe same way.  I have been told that, since the late events, he requires\r\nto have the same thing said more than three times over by the queen,\r\nbefore obeying her.”  It was not with regard to his mother only that\r\nCharles had changed.  “His looks,” says Cavalli, “have become melancholy\r\nand sombre; in his conversations and audiences he does not look the\r\nspeaker in the face; he droops his head, closes his eyes, opens them all\r\nat once, and, as if he found the movement painful, closes them again with\r\nno less suddenness.  It is feared that the demon of vengeance has\r\npossessed him; he used to be merely severe; it is feared that he is\r\nbecoming cruel.  He is temperate in his diet; drinks nothing but water.\r\nTo tire himself at any price, is his object.  He remains on horseback for\r\ntwelve or fourteen consecutive hours; and so he goes hunting and coursing\r\nthrough the woods the same animal, the stag, for two or three days, never\r\nstopping but to eat, and never resting but for an instant during the\r\nnight.”  He was passionately fond of all bodily exercises, the practice\r\nof arms, and the game of tennis.  “He had a forge set up for himself,”\r\n says Brantome, “and I have seen him forging cannon, and horseshoes, and\r\nother things as stoutly as the most robust farriers and forgemen.”  He,\r\nat the same time, showed a keen and intelligent interest in intellectual\r\nworks and pleasures.  He often had a meeting, in the evening, of poets,\r\nmen of letters, and artists--Ronsard, Amadis Jamin, Jodelle, Daurat,\r\nBaif; in 1570 he gave them letters patent for the establishment of an\r\nAcademy of poetry and music, the first literary society founded in France\r\nby a king; but it disappeared amidst the civil wars.  Charles IX.\r\nhimself sang in the choir, and he composed a few hunting-airs.  Ronsard\r\nwas a favorite, almost a friend, with him; he used to take him with him\r\non his trips, and give him quarters in his palace, and there was many an\r\ninterchange of verse between them, in which Ronsard did not always have\r\nthe advantage.  Charles gave a literary outlet to his passion for\r\nhunting; he wrote a little treatise entitled La Chasse royale, which was\r\nnot published until 1625, and of which M. Henry Chevreul brought out, in\r\n1857, a charming and very correct edition.  Charles IX. dedicated it to\r\nhis lieutenant of the hunt, Mesnil, in terms of such modest and\r\naffectionate simplicity that they deserve to be kept in remembrance.\r\n“Mesnil,” said the king, “I should feel myself far too ungrateful, and\r\nexpect to be chidden for presumption, if, in this little treatise that I\r\nam minded to make upon stag hunting, I did not, before any one begins to\r\nread it, avow and confess that I learnt from you what little I know.\r\n.  .  .  I beg you, also, Mesnil, to be pleased to correct and erase what\r\nthere is wrong in the said treatise, the which, if peradventure it is so\r\ndone that there is nothing more required than to re-word and alter, the\r\ncredit will be firstly yours for having so well taught me, and then mine\r\nfor having so well remembered.  Well, then, having been taught by so good\r\na master, I will be bold enough to essay it, begging you to accept it as\r\nheartily as I present it and dedicate it to you.”\r\n\r\nThese details and this quotation are allowable in order to shed full\r\nlight upon the private and incoherent character of this king, who bears\r\nthe responsibility of one of the most tragic events in French history.\r\nIn the spring of 1574, at the age of twenty-three years and eleven\r\nmonths, and after a reign of eleven years and six months, Charles IX.\r\nwas attacked by an inflammatory malady, which brought on violent\r\nhemorrhage; he was revisited, in his troubled sleep, by the same bloody\r\nvisions about which, a few days after the St. Bartholomew, he had spoken\r\nto Ambrose Pare.  He no longer retained in his room anybody but two of\r\nhis servants and his nurse, “of whom he was very fond, although she was a\r\nHuguenot,” says the contemporary chronicler Peter de l’Estoile.  “When\r\nshe had lain down upon a chest, and was just beginning to doze, hearing\r\nthe king moaning, weeping, and sighing, she went full gently up to the\r\nbed.  ‘Ah, nurse, nurse,’ said the king, ‘what bloodshed and what\r\nmurders!  Ah! what evil counsel have I followed!  O, my God! forgive me\r\nthem and have mercy upon me, if it may please Thee!  I know not what hath\r\ncome to me, so bewildered and agitated do they make me.  What will be the\r\nend of it all?  What shall I do?  I am lost; I see it well.’ Then said\r\nthe nurse to him, ‘Sir, the murders be on the heads of those who made you\r\ndo them!  Of yourself, sir, you never could; and since you are not\r\nconsenting thereto, and are sorry therefor, believe that God will not put\r\nthem down to your account, and will hide them with the cloak of justice\r\nof His Son, to whom alone you must have recourse.  But for God’s sake,\r\nlet your Majesty cease weeping!’  And thereupon, having been to fetch him\r\na pocket-handkerchief, because his own was soaked with tears, after that\r\nthe king had taken it from her hand, he signed to her to go away and\r\nleave him to his rest.”\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, May 30, 1574, Whitsunday, about three in the afternoon,\r\nCharles IX. expired, after having signed an ordinance conferring the\r\nregency upon his mother Catherine, “who accepted it,” was the expression\r\nin the letters patent, “at the request of the Duke of Alencon, the King\r\nof Navarre, and other princes and peers of France.”  According to\r\nD’Aubigne, Charles used often to say of his brother Henry, that, “when he\r\nhad a kingdom on his hands, the administration would find him out, and\r\nthat he would disappoint those who had hopes of him.”  The last words he\r\nsaid were, “that he was glad not to have left any young child to succeed\r\nhim, very well knowing that France needs a man, and that, with a child,\r\nthe king and the reign are unhappy.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.----HENRY III. AND THE RELIGIOUS WARS. (1574-1589.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Henry III----388]\r\n\r\nThough elected King of Poland on the 9th of May, 1573, Henry, Duke of\r\nAnjou, had not yet left Paris at the end of the summer.  Impatient at his\r\nslowness to depart, Charles IX. said, with his usual oath, “By God’s\r\ndeath! my brother or I must at once leave the kingdom: my mother shall\r\nnot succeed in preventing it.”  “Go,” said Catherine to Henry; “you will\r\nnot be away long.”  She foresaw, with no great sorrow one would say, the\r\ndeath of Charles IX., and her favorite son’s accession to the throne of\r\nFrance.  Having arrived in Poland on the 25th of January, 1574, and been\r\ncrowned at Cracow on the 24th of February, Henry had been scarcely four\r\nmonths King of Poland when he was apprised, about the middle of June,\r\nthat his brother Charles had lately died, on the 30th of May, and that he\r\nwas King of France.  “Do not waste your time in deliberating,” said his\r\nFrench advisers; “you must go and take possession of the throne of France\r\nwithout abdicating that of Poland: go at once and without fuss.”  Henry\r\nfollowed this counsel.  He left Cracow, on the 18th of June, with a very\r\nfew attendants.  Some Poles were apprehensive of his design, but said\r\nnothing about it.  He went a quarter of a league on foot to reach the\r\nhorses which were awaiting him, set off at a gallop, rode all night, and\r\narrived next day early on the frontier of Moravia, an Austrian province.\r\nThe royal flight created a great uproar at Cracow; the noblemen, and even\r\nthe peasants, armed with stakes and scythes, set out in pursuit of their\r\nking.  They did not come up with him; they fell in with his chancellor\r\nonly, Guy du Faur, Sieur de Pibrac, who had missed him at the appointed\r\nmeeting-place, and who, whilst seeking to rejoin him, had lost himself in\r\nthe forests and marshes, concealed himself in the osiers and reeds, and\r\nbeen obliged now and then to dip his head, in the mud to avoid the arrows\r\ndischarged on all sides by the peasants in pursuit of the king.  Being\r\narrested by some people who were for taking him back to Cracow and paying\r\nhim out for his complicity in his master’s flight, he with great\r\ndifficulty obtained his release and permission to continue his road.\r\nDestined to become more celebrated by his writings and by his Quatrains\r\nmoraux than by his courtly adventures, Pibrac rejoined King Henry at\r\nVienna, where the Emperor Maximilian II. received him with great\r\nsplendor.  Delivered from fatigue and danger, Henry appeared to think of\r\nnothing but resting and diverting himself; he tarried to his heart’s\r\ncontent at Vienna, Venice, Ferrara, Mantua, and Turin.  He was everywhere\r\nwelcomed with brilliant entertainments, which the Emperor Maximilian and\r\nthe senators of Venice accompanied with good advice touching the\r\ngovernment of France in her religious troubles; and the nominal sovereign\r\nof two kingdoms took nearly three months in going from that whence he had\r\nfled to that of which he was about to take possession.  Having started\r\nfrom Cracow on the 18th of June, 1574, he did not arrive until the 5th of\r\nSeptember at Lyons, whither the queen-mother had sent his brother, the\r\nDuke of Alencon, and his brother-in-law, the King of Navarre, to receive\r\nhim, going herself as far as Bourgoin in Dauphiny, in order to be the\r\nfirst to see her darling son again.\r\n\r\nThe king’s entry into France caused, says De Thou, a strange revulsion in\r\nall minds.  “During the lifetime of Charles IX., none had seemed more\r\nworthy of the throne than Henry, and everybody desired to have him for\r\nmaster.  But scarcely had he arrived when disgust set in to the extent of\r\nauguring very ill of his reign.  There was no longer any trace in this\r\nprince, who had been nursed, so to speak, in the lap of war, of that\r\nmanly and warlike courage which had been so much admired.  He no longer\r\nrode on horseback; he did not show himself amongst his people, as his\r\npredecessors had been wont to do; he was only to be seen shut up with a\r\nfew favorites in a little painted boat which went up and down the Saone\r\nhe no longer took his meals without a balustrade, which did not allow him\r\nto be approached any Hearer; and if anybody had any petitions to present\r\nto him, they had to wait for him as he came out from dinner, when he took\r\nthem as he hurried by.  For the greater part of the day he remained\r\ncloseted with some young folks, who alone had the prince’s ear, without\r\nany body’s knowing how they had arrived at this distinction, whilst the\r\ngreat, and those whose services were known, could scarcely get speech of\r\nhim.  Showiness and effeminacy had taken the place of the grandeur and\r\nmajesty which had formerly distinguished our kings.”  [De Thou, _Histoire\r\nuniverselle,_ t. vii.  p. 134.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Indolence of Henry III---390]\r\n\r\n“The time was ill chosen by Henry III. for this change of habits and for\r\nbecoming an indolent and voluptuous king, set upon taking his pleasure in\r\nhis court and isolating himself from his people.  The condition and ideas\r\nof France were also changing, but to issue in the assumption of quite a\r\ndifferent character and to receive development in quite a different\r\ndirection.  Catholics or Protestants, agents of the king’s government or\r\nmalcontents, all were getting a taste for and adopting the practice of\r\nindependence and a vigorous and spontaneous activity.  The bonds of the\r\nfeudal system were losing their hold, and were not yet replaced by those\r\nof a hierarchically organized administration.  Religious creeds and\r\npolitical ideas were becoming, for thoughtful and straightforward\r\nspirits, rules of conduct, powerful motives of action, and they furnished\r\nthe ambitious with effective weapons.  The theologians of the Catholic\r\nchurch and of the Reformed churches--on one side the Cardinal of\r\nLorraine, Cardinals Campeggi and Sadolet, and other learned priests or\r\nprelates, and on the other side Calvin, who had been nursed, so to speak,\r\nin the lap of war, of that manly and warlike courage which had been so\r\nmuch admired.

Showiness and effeminacy\r\nhad taken the place of the grandeur and majesty which had formerly\r\ndistinguished our kings.”  [De Thou, Histoire universelle, t. vii.\r\np. 134.]\r\n\r\nThe time was ill chosen by Henry III.  for this change of habits and for\r\nbecoming an indolent and voluptuous king, set upon taking his pleasure in\r\nhis court and isolating himself from his people.  The condition and\r\nideas of France were also changing, but to issue in the assumption of\r\nquite a different character and to receive development in quite a\r\ndifferent direction.  Catholics or Protestants, agents of the king’s\r\ngovernment or malcontents, all were getting a taste for and adopting the\r\npractice of independence and a vigorous and spontaneous activity.  The\r\nbonds of the feudal system were losing their hold, and were not yet\r\nreplaced by those of a hierarchically organized administration.\r\nReligious creeds and political ideas were becoming, for thoughtful and\r\nstraightforward spirits, rules of conduct, powerful motives of action,\r\nand they furnished the ambitious with effective weapons.  The theologians\r\nof the Catholic church and of the Reformed churches--on one side the\r\nCardinal of Lorraine, Cardinals Campeggi and Sadolet, and other learned\r\npriests or prelates, and on the other side Calvin, Theodore de Beze,\r\nMelancthon, and Bucer--were working with zeal to build up into systems of\r\ndogma their interpretations of the great facts of Christianity, and they\r\nsucceeded in implanting a passionate attachment to them in their flocks.\r\nIndependently of these religious controversies, superior minds, profound\r\nlawyers, learned scholars were applying their energies to founding, on a\r\nphilosophical basis and historic principles, the organization of\r\ngovernments and the reciprocal rights of princes and peoples.  Ramus,\r\none of the last and of the most to be lamented victims of the\r\nSt. Bartholomew; Francis Hotman, who, in his Franco-Gallia, aspired to\r\ngraft the new national liberties upon the primitive institutions of the\r\nFranks; Hubert Languet, the eloquent author of the _Vindicice contra\r\ntyrannos, or de la Puissance legitime du Prince cur le Peuple et du\r\nPeuple sur le Prince;_ John Bodin, the first, in original merit, amongst\r\nthe publicists of the sixteenth century, in his _six livres de LA\r\nREPUBLIQUE;_ all these eminent men boldly tackled the great questions of\r\npolitical liberty or of legislative reforms. _Le Contre-un,_ that\r\nrepublican treatise by De la Boetie, written in 1546, and circulated, at\r\nfirst, in manuscript only, was inserted, between 1576 and 1578, in the\r\n_Memoires de l’Etat de France,_ and passionately extolled by the\r\nindependent thinker Michael de Montaigne in his Essais, of which nine\r\neditions were published between 1580 and 1598, and evidently very much\r\nread in the world of letters.  An intellectual movement so active and\r\npowerful could not fail to have a potent effect upon political life.\r\nBefore the St. Bartholomew, the great religious and political parties,\r\nthe Catholic and the Protestant, were formed and at grips; the house of\r\nLorraine at the head of the Catholics, and the house of Bourbon, Conde,\r\nand Coligny at the head of the Protestants, with royalty trying feebly\r\nand vainly to maintain between them a hollow peace.  To this stormy\r\nand precarious, but organized and clearly defined condition, the\r\nSt.  Bartholomew had caused anarchy to succeed.  Protestantism,\r\nvanquished but not destroyed, broke up into provincial and municipal\r\nassociations without recognized and dominant heads, without discipline\r\nor combination in respect of either their present management or their\r\nultimate end.  Catholicism, though victorious, likewise underwent a\r\nbreak-up; men of mark, towns and provinces, would not accept the\r\nSt. Bartholomew and its consequences; a new party, the party of the\r\npolicists, sprang up, opposed to the principle and abjuring the practice\r\nof persecution, having no mind to follow either the Catholics in their\r\noutrages or royalty in its tergiversations, and striving to maintain in\r\nthe provinces and the towns, where it had the upper hand, enough of order\r\nand of justice to at least keep at a distance the civil war which was\r\nelsewhere raging.  Languedoc owed to Marshal de Damville, second son of\r\nthe Constable Anne de Montmorency, this comparatively bearable position.\r\nBut the degree of security and of local peace which it offered the people\r\nwas so imperfect, so uncertain, that the break-up of the country and of\r\nthe state went still farther.  In a part of Languedoc, in the Vivarais,\r\nthe inhabitants, in order to put their habitations and their property in\r\nsafety, resolved to make a league amongst themselves, without consulting\r\nany authority, not even Marshal de Damville, the peace-seeking governor\r\nof their province.  Their treaty of alliance ran, that arms should be\r\nlaid down throughout the whole of the Vivarais; that none, foreigner or\r\nnative, should be liable to trouble for the past; that tillers of the\r\nsoil and traders should suffer no detriment in person or property; that\r\nall hostilities should cease in the towns and all forays in the country;\r\nthat there should everywhere be entire freedom for commerce; that cattle\r\nwhich had been lifted should be immediately restored gratis; that\r\nconcerted action should be taken to get rid of the garrisons out of the\r\ncountry and to raze the fortresses, according as the public weal might\r\nrequire; and finally that whosoever should dare to violate these\r\nregulations should be regarded as a traitor and punished as a disturber\r\nof the public peace.  “As soon as the different authorities in the state,\r\nMarshal de Damville as well as the rest, were informed of this novelty,”\r\n says De Thou, “they made every effort to prevent it from taking effect.\r\n‘Nothing could be of more dangerous example,’ they said, ‘than to suffer\r\nthe people to make treaties in this way and on their own authority,\r\nwithout waiting for the consent of his Majesty or of those who\r\nrepresented him in the provinces.’ The folks of the Vivarais, on the\r\ncontrary, presumed to justify themselves by saying that the step they had\r\ntaken did not in any way infringe the king’s authority; that it was\r\nrather an opening given by them for securely establishing tranquillity in\r\nthe kingdom; that nothing was more advantageous or could contribute more\r\ntowards peace than to raze all those fortresses set up in the heart of\r\nthe state, which were like so many depots of revolt; that by a diminution\r\nof the garrisons the revenues of his Majesty would be proportionately\r\naugmented; that, at any rate, there would result this advantage, that the\r\nlands, which formed almost the whole wealth of the kingdom, would be\r\ncultivated, that commerce would flourish, and that the people, delivered\r\nfrom fear of the many scoundrels who, found a retreat in those places,\r\nwould at last be able to draw breath after the many misfortunes they had\r\nexperienced.”\r\n\r\nIt was in this condition of disorganization and red-hot anarchy that\r\nHenry III., on his return from Poland, and after the St. Bartholomew,\r\nfound France; it was in the face of all these forces, full of life, but\r\nscattered and excited one against another, that, with the aid of his\r\nmother, Catherine, he had to re-establish unity in the state, the\r\neffectiveness of the government, and the public peace.  It was not a task\r\nfor which the tact of an utterly corrupted woman and an irresolute prince\r\nsufficed.  What could the artful manoeuvrings of Catherine and the\r\nwaverings of Henry III. do towards taming both Catholics and Protestants\r\nat the same time, and obliging them to live at peace with one another,\r\nunder one equitable and effective power?  Henry IV. was as yet unformed,\r\nnor was his hour yet come for this great work.  Henry III. and Catherine\r\nde’ Medici failed in it completely; their government of fifteen years\r\nserved only to make them lose their reputation for ability, and to\r\naggravate for France the evils which it was their business to heal.  In\r\n1575, a year only after Henry III.’s accession, revolt penetrated to the\r\nroyal household.  The Duke of Alencon, the king’s younger brother, who,\r\nsince his brother’s coronation, took the title of Duke of Anjou, escaped\r\non the 15th of September from the Louvre by a window, and from Paris by a\r\nhole made in the wall of circumvallation.  He fled to Dreux, a town in\r\nhis appanage, and put himself at the head of a large number of\r\nmalcontents, nobles and burgesses, Catholic and Reformed, mustered around\r\nhim under this name of no religious significance between the two old\r\nparties.  On the 17th of September, in his manifesto, he gave as reasons\r\nfor his revolt, excessive taxation, waste of the public revenues, the\r\nfeebleness of the royal authority, incapable as it was of putting a stop\r\nto the religious troubles, and the disgrace which had been inflicted upon\r\nhimself “by pernicious ministers who desire to have the government in\r\ntheir sole patronage, excluding from it the foremost and the most\r\nillustrious of the court, and devouring all that there is remaining to\r\nthe poor people.”  He protested his devotion to the king his brother, at\r\nthe same time declaring war against the Guises.\r\n\r\nKing Henry of Navarre, testifying little sympathy with the Duke of Anjou,\r\nremained at court, abandoning himself apparently to his pleasures alone.\r\nTwo of his faithful servants (the poet-historian D’Aubigne was one of\r\nthem) heard him one night sighing as he lay in bed, and humming half\r\naloud this versicle from the eighty-eighth Psalm:--\r\n\r\n               “Removed from friends, I sigh alone,\r\n               In a loathed dungeon laid, where none\r\n               A visit will vouchsafe to me,\r\n               Confined past hope of liberty.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said D’Aubigne eagerly, “it is true, then, that the Sprit of God\r\nworketh and dwelleth in you still?  You sigh unto God because of the\r\nabsence of your friends and faithful servants; and all the while they are\r\ntogether, sighing because of yours and laboring for your freedom.  But\r\nyou have only tears in your eyes, and they, arms in hand, are fighting\r\nyour enemies.  As for us two, we were talking of taking to flight\r\ntomorrow, when your voice made us draw the curtain.  Bethink you, sir,\r\nthat, after us, the hands that will serve you would not dare refuse to\r\nemploy poison and the knife.”  Henry, much moved, resolved to follow the\r\nexample of the Duke of Anjou.  His departure was fixed for the 3d of\r\nFebruary, 1576.  He went and slept at Senlis; hunted next day very early,\r\nand, on his return from hunting, finding his horses baited and ready,\r\n“What news?” he asked.  “Sir,” said D’Aubigne, “we are betrayed; the king\r\nknows all; the road to death and shame is Paris; that to life and glory\r\nis anywhere else.”  “That is more than enough; away!” replied Henry.\r\nThey rode all night, and arrived without misadventure at Alencon.  Two\r\nhundred and fifty gentlemen, having been apprised in time, went thither\r\nto join the King of Navarre.  He pursued his road in their company.  From\r\nSenlis to the Loire he was silent but when he had crossed the river,\r\n“Praised be God, who has delivered me!” he cried; “at Paris they were the\r\ndeath of my mother; there they killed the admiral and my best servants;\r\nand they had no mind to do any better by me, if God had not had me in his\r\nkeeping.  I return thither no more unless I am dragged.  I regret only\r\ntwo things that I have left behind at Paris--mass and my wife.  As for\r\nmass, I will try to do without it; but as for my wife, I cannot; I mean\r\nto see her again.”  He disavowed the appearances of Catholicism he had\r\nassumed, again made open profession of Protestantism by holding at the\r\nbaptismal font, in the conventicle, the daughter of a physician amongst\r\nhis friends.  Then he reached Bearn, declaring that he meant to remain\r\nthere independent and free.  A few days before his departure he had\r\nwritten to one of his Bearnese friends, “The court is the strangest you\r\never saw.  We are almost always ready to cut one another’s throats.  We\r\nwear daggers, shirts of mail, and very often the whole cuirass under the\r\ncape.  I am only waiting for the opportunity to deliver a little battle,\r\nfor they tell me they will kill me, and I want to be beforehand.”\r\n Mesdames de Carnavalet and de Sauve, two of his fair friends, had warned\r\nhim that, far from giving him the lieutenant-generalship, which had been\r\nso often promised him, it had been decided to confer this office on the\r\nking’s brother, in order to get him back to court and seize his person as\r\nsoon as he arrived.\r\n\r\nIt was the increasing preponderance of the Guises, at court as well as in\r\nthe country, which caused the two princes to take this sudden resolution.\r\nSince Henry III.’s coming to the throne, war had gone on between the\r\nCatholics and the Protestants, but languidly and with frequent\r\nsuspensions through local and shortlived truces.  The king and the\r\nqueen-mother would have been very glad that the St. Bartholomew should be\r\nshort-lived also, as a necessary but transitory crisis; it had rid them\r\nof their most formidable adversaries, Coligny and the Reformers of note\r\nwho were about him.  Henry and Catherine aspired to no more than resuming\r\ntheir policy of manoeuvring and wavering between the two parties engaged\r\nin the struggle; but it was not for so poor a result that the ardent\r\nCatholics had committed the crime of the St. Bartholomew; they promised\r\nthemselves from it the decisive victory of their church and of their\r\nsupremacy.  Henry de Guise came forward as their leader in this grand\r\ndesign; there are to be read, beneath a portrait of him done in the\r\nsixteenth century, these verses, also of that date:--\r\n\r\n               “The virtue, greatness, wisdom from on high,\r\n               Of yonder duke, triumphant far and near,\r\n               Do make bad men to shrink with coward fear,\r\n               And God’s own Catholic church to fructify.\r\n               In armor clad, like maddened Mars he moves;\r\n               The trembling Huguenot cowers at his glance;\r\n               A prop for holy church is his good lance;\r\n               His eye is ever mild to those he loves.”\r\n\r\nGuise cultivated very carefully this ardent confidence on the part of\r\nCatholic France; he recommended to his partisans attention to little\r\npious and popular practices.  “I send you some paternosters [meaning, in\r\nthe plural, the beads of a chaplet, or the chaplet entire],” he wrote to\r\nhis wife, Catherine of Cleves; “you will have strings made for them and\r\nstring them together.  I don’t know whether you dare offer some of them\r\nto the queens and to my lady mother.  Ask advice of Mesdames de Retz and\r\nde Villeroy about it.”  The flight and insurrection of the Duke of Anjou\r\nand the King of Navarre furnished the Duke of Guise with a very natural\r\noccasion for re-engaging in the great struggle between Catholicism and\r\nProtestantism, wherein the chief part belonged to him.  Let us recur, for\r\na moment, to the origin of that struggle and the part taken in it, at the\r\noutset, by the princes of the house of Lorraine.  “As early as the year\r\n1562, twenty-six years before the affair of the barricades,” says M.\r\nVitet in the excellent introduction which he has put at the head of his\r\nbeautiful historic dramas from the last half of the sixteenth century,\r\n“Cardinal Charles of Lorraine, being at the Council of Trent, conceived\r\nthe plan of a Holy League, or association of Catholics, which was to have\r\nthe triple object of defending, by armed force, the Romish church in\r\nFrance, of obtaining for the cardinal’s brother, Duke Francis de Guise,\r\nthe lieutenant-generalship of the kingdom, and of helping him to ascend\r\nthe throne, in case the line of the Valois should become extinct.  The\r\ndeath of Duke Francis, murdered in front of Orleans by Poltrot, did not\r\npermit the cardinal to carry out his plan.  Five years afterwards, Henry\r\nde Guise, eldest son of Francis, and then eighteen years of age, caused\r\nto be drawn up, for the first time, a form of oath whereby the\r\ndignitaries bound themselves to sacrifice their goods and lives in\r\ndefence of the Catholic religion in the face of and against all, except\r\nthe king, the royal family, and the princes of their connection.  This\r\nform was signed by the nobility of Champagne and Brie, a province of\r\nwhich Henry de Guise was governor, and on the 25th of July, 1568, the\r\nbishop and clergy of Troyes signed it likewise.  The association is\r\nnamed, in the form, _Holy League, Christian and royal_.  Up to the year\r\n1576 it remained secret, and did not cross the boundaries of Champagne.”\r\n To this summary of M. Vitet’s may be added that independently of the\r\nChampagnese league of 1568 and in the interval between 1568 and 1575\r\nthere had been formed, in some provinces and towns, other local\r\nassociations for the defence of the Catholic church against the heretics.\r\nWhen, in 1575, first the Duke of Anjou and after him the King of Navarre\r\nwere seen flying from the court of Henry III. and commencing an\r\ninsurrection with the aid of a considerable body of German auxiliaries\r\nand French refugees, already on French soil and on their way across\r\nChampagne, the peril of the Catholic church appeared so grave and so\r\nurgent that, in the threatened provinces, the Catholics devoted\r\nthemselves with ardor to the formation of a grand association for the\r\ndefence of their cause.  Then and thus was really born the League, secret\r\nat first, but, before long, publicly and openly proclaimed, which held so\r\nimportant a place in the history of the sixteenth century.  Picardy and\r\nChampagne were the first scene of its formation; but in the neighboring\r\nprovinces the same travail took place and brought forth fruits.  At\r\nParis, a burgess named La Roche-Blond, and devoted to the Guises, a\r\nperfumer named Peter de la Bruyere and his son Matthew de la Bruyere,\r\ncouncillor at the Chatelet, were, says De Thou, the first and most\r\nzealous preachers of the Union.  “At their solicitation,” continues the\r\naustere magistrate, “all the debauchees there were in this great city,\r\nall folks whose only hope was in civil war for the indulgence of their\r\nlibertinism or for a safe means of satisfying their avarice or their\r\nambition, enrolled themselves emulously in this force.  Many, even of the\r\nrichest burgesses, whose hatred for Protestants blinded them so far as\r\nnot to see the dangers to which such associations expose public\r\ntranquillity in a well-regulated state, had the weakness to join the\r\nseditious.”\r\n\r\nMany asked for time to consider, and, before making any engagement, they\r\nwent to see President de Thou [Christopher, premier president of the\r\nParliament of Paris since 1562, and father of the historian James\r\nAugustus de Thou], informed him of these secret assemblies and all that\r\nwent on there, and begged him to tell them whether he approved of them,\r\nand whether it was true that the court authorized them.  M. de Thou\r\nanswered them at once, with that straightforwardness which was innate in\r\nhim, that these kinds of proceedings had not yet come to his knowledge,\r\nthat he doubted whether they had the approbation of his Majesty, and that\r\nthey would do wisely to hold aloof from all such associations.  The\r\nauthority of this great man began to throw suspicion upon the designs of\r\nthe Unionists, and his reply prevented many persons from casting in their\r\nlot with the party; but they who found themselves at the head of this\r\nfaction were not the folks to so easily give up their projects, for they\r\nfelt themselves too well supported at court and amongst the people.  They\r\nadvised the Lorraine princes to have the Union promulgated in the\r\nprovinces, and to labor to make the nobility of the kingdom enter it.\r\n\r\nHenry de Guise did not hesitate.  At the same time that he avowed the\r\nLeague and labored to propagate it, he did what was far more effectual\r\nfor its success: he entered the field and gained a victory.  The German\r\nallies and French refugees who had come to support Prince Henry de Conde\r\nand the Duke of Anjou in their insurrection advanced into Champagne.\r\nGuise had nothing ready, neither army nor money; he mustered in haste\r\nthree thousand horse, who were to be followed by a body of foot and a\r\nmoiety of the king’s guards.  “I haven’t a son,” he wrote to his wife;\r\n“take something out of the king’s chest, if there is anything there;\r\nprovided you know that there is something there, don’t be afraid; take it\r\nand send it me at once.  As for the _reitres,_ they are more afraid of us\r\nthan we of them; don’t be frightened about them on my account; the\r\ngreatest danger I shall run will be that a glass of wine may break in my\r\nhand.”  He set out in pursuit of the Germans, came up with them on the\r\n10th of October, 1575, at Port-a-Binson, on the Marne, and ordered them\r\nto be attacked by his brother the Duke of Mayenne, whom he supported\r\nvigorously.  They were broken and routed.  The hunt, according to the\r\nexpression at the time, lasted all the rest of the day and during the\r\nnight.  “A world of dead covers the field of battle,” wrote Guise.  He\r\nhad himself been wounded: he went in obstinate pursuit of a mounted foe\r\nwhom he had twice touched with his sword, and who, in return, had fired\r\ntwo pistol-shots, of which one took effect in the leg, and the other\r\ncarried away part of his cheek and his left ear.  Thence came his name of\r\nHenry the Scarred (_le Balafre_), which has clung to him in history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Henry le Balafre----400]\r\n\r\nScarcely four years had rolled away since the St. Bartholomew.  In vain\r\nhad been the massacre of ten thousand Protestants, according to the\r\nlowest, and of one hundred thousand, according to the highest estimates,\r\nbesides nearly all the renowned chiefs of the party.  Charles IX.’s\r\nearnest prayer, “That none remain to reproach me!” was so far from\r\naccomplishment that the war between Catholicism and Protestantism\r\nrecommenced in almost every part of France with redoubled passion, with a\r\nnew importance of character, and with symptoms of much longer duration\r\nthan at its first outbreak.  Both parties had found leaders made, both\r\nfrom their position and their capacity, to command them.  Admiral Coligny\r\nwas succeeded by the King of Navarre, who was destined to become Henry\r\nIV.; and Duke Francis of Guise by his son Henry, if not as able, at any\r\nrate as brave a soldier, and a more determined Catholic than he.  Amongst\r\nthe Protestants, Sully and Da Plessis-Mornay were assuming shape and\r\nimportance by the side of the King of Navarre.  Catherine de’ Medici\r\nplaced at her son’s service her Italian adroitness, her maternal\r\ndevotion, and an energy rare for a woman between sixty and seventy years\r\nof age, for forty-three years a queen, and worn out by intrigue, and\r\nbusiness, and pleasure.  Finally, to the question of religion, the\r\nprimary cause of the struggle, was added a question of kingship, kept in\r\nthe background, but ever present in thought and deed: which of the three\r\nhouses of Valois, Bourbon, and Lorraine should remain in or enter upon\r\npossession of the throne of France.  The interests and the ambition of\r\nfamilies and of individuals were playing their part simultaneously with\r\nthe controversies and the passions of creed.\r\n\r\nThis state of things continued for twelve years, from 1576 to 1588, with\r\nconstant alternations of war, truce, and precarious peace, and in the\r\nmidst of constant hesitation, on the part of Henry III., between alliance\r\nwith the League, commanded by the Duke of Guise, and adjustment with the\r\nProtestants, of whom the King of Navarre was every day becoming the more\r\nand more avowed leader.  Between 1576 and 1580, four treaties of peace\r\nwere concluded; in 1576, the peace called Monsieur’s, signed at Chastenay\r\nin Orleanness; in 1577, the peace of Bergerac or of Poitiers; in 1579,\r\nthe peace of Nerac; in 1580, the peace of Fleix in Perigord.  In\r\nNovember, 1576, the states-general were convoked and assembled at Blois,\r\nwhere they sat and deliberated up to March, 1577, without any important\r\nresult.  Neither these diplomatic conventions nor these national\r\nassemblies had force enough to establish a real and lasting peace between\r\nthe two parties, for the parties themselves would not have it; in vain\r\ndid Henry III. make concessions and promises of liberty to the\r\nProtestants; he was not in a condition to guarantee their execution and\r\nmake it respected by their adversaries.  At heart neither Protestants nor\r\nCatholics were for accepting mutual liberty; not only did they both\r\nconsider themselves in possession of all religious truth, but they also\r\nconsidered themselves entitled to impose it by force upon their\r\nadversaries.  The discovery (and the term is used advisedly, so slow to\r\ncome and so long awaited has been the fact which it expresses), the\r\ndiscovery of the legitimate separation between the intellectual world and\r\nthe political world, and of the necessity, also, of having the\r\nintellectual world free in order that it may not make upon the political\r\nworld a war which, in the inevitable contact between them, the latter\r\ncould not support for long, this grand and salutary discovery, be it\r\nrepeated, and its practical influence in the government of people cannot\r\nbe realized save in communities already highly enlightened and\r\npolitically well ordered.  Good order, politically, is indispensable\r\nif liberty, intellectually, is to develop itself regularly and do the\r\ncommunity more good than it causes of trouble and embarrassment.  They\r\nonly who have confidence in human intelligence sincerely admit its right\r\nto freedom; and confidence in human intelligence is possible only in the\r\nmidst of a political regimen which likewise gives the human community the\r\nguarantees whereof its interests and its lasting security have absolute\r\nneed.  The sixteenth century was a long way from these conditions of\r\nharmony between the intellectual world and the political world, the\r\nnecessity of which is beginning to be understood and admitted by only the\r\nmost civilized and best governed amongst modern communities.  It is one\r\nof the most tardy and difficult advances that people have to accomplish\r\nin their life of labor.  The sixteenth century helped France to make\r\nconsiderable strides in civilization and intellectual development; but\r\nthe eighteenth and nineteenth have taught her how great still, in the art\r\nof governing and being governed as a free people, are her children’s want\r\nof foresight and inexperience, and, to what extent they require a strong\r\nand sound organization of political freedom in order that they may\r\nwithout danger enjoy intellectual freedom, its pleasures and its glories.\r\n\r\nFrom 1576 to 1588, Henry III. had seen the difficulties of his government\r\ncontinuing and increasing.  His attempt to maintain his own independence\r\nand the mastery of the situation between Catholics and Protestants, by\r\nmaking concessions and promises at one time to the former and at another\r\nto the latter, had not succeeded; and in 1584 it became still more\r\ndifficult to practise.  On the 10th of June in that year Henry III.’s\r\nbrother, the Duke of Anjou, died at Chateau-Thierry.  By this death the\r\nleader of the Protestants, Henry, King of Navarre, became lawful heir to\r\nthe throne of France.  The Leaguers could not stomach that prospect.  The\r\nGuises turned it to formidable account.  They did not hesitate to make\r\nthe future of France a subject of negotiation with Philip II. of Spain,\r\nat that time her most dangerous enemy in Europe.  By a secret convention\r\nconcluded at Joinville on the 31st of December, 1584, between Philip and\r\nthe Guises, it was stipulated that at the death of Henry III. the crown\r\nshould pass to Charles, Cardinal of Bourbon, sixty-four years of age, the\r\nKing of Navarre’s uncle, who, in order to make himself king, undertook to\r\nset aside his nephew’s hereditary right, and forbid, absolutely,\r\nheretical worship in France.  He published on the 31st of March, 1585,\r\na declaration wherein he styled himself premier prince of the blood, and\r\nconferred upon the Duke of Guise the title of lieutenant-general of the\r\nLeague.  By a bull of September 10, 1585, Sixtus V., but lately elected\r\npope, excommunicated the King of Navarre as a heretic and relapsed,\r\ndenying him any right of succession to the crown of France, and releasing\r\nhis Narvarrese subjects from their oath of fidelity.  Sixtus V. did not\r\nyet know what manner of man he was thus attacking.  The King of Navarre\r\ndid not confine himself to protesting in France, on the 10th of June,\r\n1585, against this act of the pope’s: he had his protest placarded at\r\nRome itself upon the statues of Pasquin and Marforio, and at the very\r\ndoors of the Vatican, referring the pope, as to the question of heresy,\r\nto a council which he claimed at an early date, and at the same time\r\nappealing against this alleged abuse of power to the court of peers of\r\nFrance, “of whom,” said he, “I have the honor to be the premier.”  The\r\nwhole of Italy, including Sixtus V. himself, a pope of independent mind\r\nand proud heart, was struck with this energetic resistance on the part of\r\na petty king.  “It would be a good thing,” said the pope to Marquis\r\nPasani, Henry III.’s ambassador, “if the king your master showed as much\r\nresolution against his enemies as the King of Navarre shows against those\r\nwho attack him.”  At the first moment Henry III. had appeared to unravel\r\nthe intentions of the League and to be disposed to resist it; by an edict\r\nof March 28, 1585, he had ordered that its adherents should be\r\nprosecuted; but Catherine de’ Medici frightened him with the war which\r\nwould infallibly be kindled, and in which he would have for enemies all\r\nthe Catholics, more irritated than ever.  And Henry III. very easily took\r\nfright.  Catherine undertook to manage the recoil for him.  “I care not\r\nwho likes it and who doesn’t,” she was wont to say in such cases.  She\r\nasked the Duke of Guise for an interview, which took place, first of all\r\nat Epernay, and afterwards at Rheims.  The hard demands of the Lorrainers\r\ndid not deter the queen-mother, and, on the 7th of July, 1585, a treaty\r\nwas concluded at Nemours between Henry III. and the League, to the effect\r\n“that by an irrevocable edict the practice of the new religion should be\r\nforbidden, and that there should henceforth be no other practice of\r\nreligion, throughout the realm of France, save that of the Catholic,\r\nApostolic, and Roman; that all the ministers should depart from the\r\nkingdom within a month; that all the subjects of his Majesty should be\r\nbound to live according to the Catholic religion and make profession\r\nthereof within six months, on pain of confiscation both of person and\r\ngoods; that heretics, of whatsoever quality they might be, should be\r\ndeclared incapable of holding benefices, public offices, positions, and\r\ndignities; that the places which had been given in guardianship to them\r\nfor their security should be taken back again forthwith; and, lastly,\r\nthat the princes designated in the treaty, amongst whom were all the\r\nGuises at the top, should receive as guarantee certain places to be held\r\nby them for five years.”\r\n\r\nThis treaty was signed by all the negotiators, and specially by the\r\nqueen-mother, the Cardinals of Bourbon and Guise, and the Dukes of Guise\r\nand Mayenne.  It was the decisive act which made the war a war of\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of July following, Henry III., on his way to the Palace of\r\nJustice to be present at the publication of the edict he had just issued\r\nin virtue of this treaty with the League, said to the Cardinal of\r\nBourbon, “My dear uncle, against my conscience, but very willingly, I\r\npublished the edicts of pacification, because they were successful in\r\ngiving relief to my people; and now I am going to publish the revocation\r\nof those edicts in accordance with my conscience, but very unwillingly,\r\nbecause on its publication hangs the ruin of my kingdom and of my\r\npeople.”  When he issued from the palace, cries of “Long live the king!”\r\n were heard; “at which astonishment was expressed,” says Peter de\r\nl’Estoile (t. i.  p. 294), “because for a long time past no such favor\r\nhad been shown him.  But it was discovered that these acclamations were\r\nthe doing of persons posted about by the Leaguers, and that, for doing\r\nit, money had been given to idlers and sweetmeats to children.”  Some\r\ndays afterwards, the King of Navarre received news of the treaty of\r\nNemours.  He was staying near Bergerac, at the castle of the Lord of La\r\nForce, with whom he was so intimate that he took with him none of his\r\nhousehold, as he preferred to be waited upon by M. de la Force’s own\r\nstaff.  “I was so grievously affected by it,” said he himself at a later\r\nperiod to M. de la Force, “that, as I pondered deeply upon it and held my\r\nhead supported upon my hand, my apprehensions of the woes I foresaw for\r\nmy country were such as to whiten one half of my mustache.”  [_Memoires\r\ndu Due de la Force,_ t. i.  p. 50.] Henry III., for his part, was but\r\nlittle touched by the shouts of Long live the king! that he heard as he\r\nleft the palace; he was too much disquieted to be rejoiced at them.  He\r\ndid not return the greeting of the municipal functionaries or of the mob\r\nthat blocked his way.  “You see how reluctant he is to embroil himself\r\nwith the Huguenots,” said the partisans of the Guises to the people.\r\n\r\nIt was the recommencement of religious civil war, with more deadliness\r\nthan ever.  The King of Navarre left no stone unturned to convince\r\neverybody, friends and enemies, great lords and commonalty, Frenchmen and\r\nforeigners, that this recurrence of war was not his doing, and that the\r\nLeaguers forced it upon him against his wish and despite of the justice\r\nof his cause.  He wrote to Henry III., “Monseigneur, as soon as the\r\noriginators of these fresh disturbances had let the effects appear of\r\ntheir ill-will towards your Majesty and your kingdom, you were pleased to\r\nwrite to me the opinion you had formed, with very good title, of their\r\nintentions; you told me that you knew, no matter what pretext they\r\nassumed, that they had designs against your person and your crown, and\r\nthat they desired their own augmentation and aggrandizement at your\r\nexpense and to your detriment.  Such were the words of your letters, Mon\r\nseigneur, and you did me the honor, whilst recognizing the connection\r\nbetween my fortunes and those of your Majesty, to add expressly that they\r\nwere compassing my ruin together with your own.  .  .  .  And now,\r\nMonseigneur, when I hear it suddenly reported that your Majesty has made\r\na treaty of peace with those who have risen up against your service,\r\nproviding that your edict be broken, your loyal subjects banished, and\r\nthe conspirators armed, and armed with your power and your authority\r\nagainst me, who have the honor of belonging to you, I leave your Majesty\r\nto judge in what a labyrinth I find myself.  .  .  .  If it is I whom\r\nthey seek, or if under my shadow (on my account) they trouble this realm,\r\nI have begged that, without henceforth causing the orders and estates of\r\nthis realm to suffer for it, and without the intervention of any army,\r\nhome or foreign, this quarrel be decided in the Duke of Guise’s person\r\nand my own, one to one, two to two, ten to ten, twenty to twenty, in any\r\nnumber that the said Lord of Guise shall think proper, with the arms\r\ncustomary amongst gentlemen of honor.  ...  It will be a happiness for\r\nus, my cousin [Henry de Conde] and myself, to deliver, at the price of\r\nour blood, the king our sovereign lord from the travails and trials that\r\nare a-brewing for him, his kingdom from trouble and confusion, his\r\nnoblesse from ruin, and all his people from extreme misery and calamity.”\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Guise respectfully declined, at the same time that he thanked\r\nthe King of Navarre for the honor done him, saying that he could not\r\naccept the offer, as he was maintaining the cause of religion, and not a\r\nprivate quarrel.  On his refusal, war appeared to everybody, and in fact\r\nbecame, inevitable.  At his re-engagement in it, the King of Navarre lost\r\nno time about informing his friends at home and his allies abroad, the\r\nnoblesse, the clergy, and the third estate of France, the city of Paris,\r\nthe Queen of England.  the Protestant princes of Germany, and the Swiss\r\ncantons, of all he had done to avoid it; he evidently laid great store\r\nupon making his conduct public and his motives understood.  He had for\r\nhis close confidant and his mouth-piece Philip du Plessis-Mornay, at\r\nthat time thirty-six years of age, one of the most learned and most\r\nhard-working as well as most zealous and most sterling amongst the\r\nroyalist Protestants of France.  It was his duty to draw up the\r\ndocuments, manifestoes, and letters published by the King of Navarre,\r\nwhen Henry did not himself stamp upon them the seal of his own language,\r\nvivid, eloquent, and captivating in its brevity.\r\n\r\nHenry III. and the queen-mother were very much struck with this\r\nintelligent energy on the part of the King of Navarre, and with the\r\ninfluence he acquired over all that portion of the French noblesse and\r\nburgesses which had not fanatically enlisted beneath the banner of the\r\nLeague.  Catherine, accustomed to count upon her skill in the art of\r\nseductive conversation, was for putting it to fresh proof in the case of\r\nthe King of Navarre.  Louis di Gonzaga, Duke of Nevers, an Italian, like\r\nherself, and one of her confidants, was sent in advance to sound Henry of\r\nNavarre.  He wrote to Henry III., “Such, sir, as you have known this\r\nprince, such is he even now; nor years nor difficulties change him; he is\r\nstill agreeable, still merry, still devoted, as he has sworn to me a\r\nhundred times, to peace and your Majesty’s service.”  Catherine proposed\r\nto him an interview.  Henry hesitated to comply.  From Jarnac, where he\r\nwas, he sent Viscount de Turenne to Catherine to make an agreement with\r\nher for a few days’ truce.  “Catherine gave Turenne to understand that,\r\nin order to have peace, the King of Navarre must turn Catholic, and put a\r\nstop to the exercise of the Reformed religion in the towns he held.”\r\n When this was reported by his envoy, Henry, who had set out for the\r\ninterview, was on the point of retracing his steps; he went on, however,\r\nas he was curious to see Catherine, to satisfy his mind upon the point\r\nand to answer her.”  They met on the 14th of December, 1586, at the\r\ncastle of St. Brice, near Cognac, both of them with gloomy looks.\r\nCatherine asked Henry whether Turenne had spoken to him about what, she\r\nsaid, was her son’s most express desire.\r\n\r\n“I am astounded,” said Henry, “that your Majesty should have taken so\r\nmuch pains to tell me what my ears are split with hearing; and likewise\r\nthat you, whose judgment is so sound, should delude yourself with the\r\nidea of solving the difficulty by means of the difficulty itself.  You\r\npropose to me a thing that I cannot do without forfeiture of conscience\r\nand honor, and without injury to the king’s service.  I should not carry\r\nwith me all those of the religion; and they of the League would be so\r\nmuch the more irritated in that they would lose their hope of depriving\r\nme of the right which I have to the throne.  They do not want me with\r\nyou, madame, for they would then be in sorry plight, you better served,\r\nand all your good subjects more happy.”  The queen-mother did not dispute\r\nthe point.  She dwelt “upon the inconveniences Henry suffered during the\r\nwar.”  “I bear them patiently, madame,” said Henry, “since you burden me\r\nwith them in order to unburden yourself of them.”  She reproached him\r\nwith not doing as he pleased in Rochelle.  “Pardon me, madame,” said he,\r\n“I please only as I ought.”  The Duke of Nevers, who was present at the\r\ninterview, was bold enough to tell him that he could not impose a tax\r\nupon Rochelle.  “That is true,” said Henry: “and so we have no Italian\r\namongst us.”  He took leave of the queen-mother, who repeated what she\r\nhad said to Viscount de Turenne, “charging him to make it known to the\r\nnoblesse who were of his following.”  “It is just eighteen months,\r\nmadame,” said he, “since I ceased to obey the king.  He has made war upon\r\nme like a wolf, you like a lioness.”  “The king and I seek nothing but\r\nyour welfare.”  “Excuse me, madame; I think it would be the contrary.”\r\n “My son, would you have the pains I have taken for the last six months\r\nremain without fruit?”  “Madame, it is not I who prevent you from resting\r\nin your bed; it is you who prevent me from lying down in mine.”  “Shall I\r\nbe always at pains, I who ask for nothing but rest?”  “Madame, the pains\r\nplease you and agree with you; if you were at rest you could not live\r\nlong.”  Catherine had brought with her what was called her flying\r\nsquadron of fair creatures of her court: but, “Madame,” said Henry, as he\r\nwithdrew, “there is nothing here for me.”\r\n\r\nBefore taking part in the war which was day by day becoming more and more\r\nclearly and explicitly a war of religion, the Protestant princes of\r\nGermany and the four great free cities of Strasbourg, Ulm, Nuremberg, and\r\nFrankfort resolved to make, as the King of Navarre had made, a striking\r\nmove on behalf of peace and religious liberty.  They sent to Henry III.\r\nambassadors, who, on the 11th of October, 1586, treated him to some frank\r\nand bold speaking.  “Our princes and masters,” they said to him, “have\r\nbeen moved with surprise and Christian compassion towards you, as\r\nfaithful friends and good neighbors of yours, on hearing that you, not\r\nbeing pleased to suffer in your kingdom any person not of the Roman\r\nreligion, have broken the edict of peace which was so solemnly done and\r\nbased upon your Majesty’s faith and promise, and which is the firm prop\r\nof the tranquillity of your Majesty and your dominions; the which changes\r\nhave appeared to them strange, seeing that your royal person, your\r\ndominions, your conscience, your honor, your reputation and good fame\r\nhappened to be very much concerned therewith.”  Shocked at so rude an\r\nadmonition, Henry III. answered, “It is God who made me king; and as I\r\nbear the title of Most Christian King, I have ever been very zealous for\r\nthe preservation of the Catholic religion.  .  .  .  It appertains to me\r\nalone to decide, according to my discernment, what may contribute to the\r\npublic weal, to make laws for to procure it, to interpret those laws, to\r\nchange them, and to abolish them, just as I find it expedient.  I have\r\ndone so hitherto, and I shall still do so for the future;” and he\r\ndismissed the ambassadors.  That very evening, on reflecting upon his\r\nwords, and considering that his answer had not met the requirements of\r\nthe case, he wrote with his own hand on a small piece of paper, “that\r\nwhoever said that in revoking the edict of pacification he had violated\r\nhis faith or put a blot upon his honor, had lied;” and he ordered one of\r\nhis officers, though the night was far advanced, to carry that paper to\r\nthe ambassadors, and read it to them textually.  They asked for a copy;\r\nbut Henry III., always careful not to have to answer for his words, had\r\nbidden his officer to suppress the document after having read it; and the\r\nGermans departed, determined upon war as well as quite convinced of the\r\nking’s arrogant pusillanimity.\r\n\r\nExcept some local and short-lived truces, war was already lazing\r\nthroughout nearly the whole of France, in Provence, in Dauphiny, in\r\nNivernais, in Guienne, in Anjou, in Normandy, in Picardy, in Champagne.\r\nWe do not care to follow the two parties through the manifold but\r\nmonotonous incidents of their tumultuous and passionate strife; we desire\r\nto review only those events that were of a general and a decisive\r\ncharacter.  They occurred, naturally, in those places which were the\r\narena, and in those armies which were under the command, of the two\r\nleaders, Duke Henry of Guise and King Henry of Navarre.  The former took\r\nupon himself the duty of repulsing, in the north-west of France, the\r\nGerman and Swiss corps which were coming to the assistance of the French\r\nReformers; the latter put himself at the head of the French Protestant\r\nforces summoned to face, in the provinces of the centre and south-west,\r\nthe royalist armies.  Guise was successful in his campaign against the\r\nforeigners: on the 26th of October, 1587, his scouts came and told him\r\nthat the Germans were at Vimory, near Montargis, dispersed throughout the\r\ncountry, without vedettes or any of the precautions of warfare; he was at\r\ntable with his principal officers at Courtenay, almost seven leagues away\r\nfrom the enemy; he remained buried in thought for a few minutes, and then\r\nsuddenly gave the order to sound boot-and-saddle [_boute-selle,_\r\ni.e., put-on saddle].  “What for, pray?” said his brother, the Duke of\r\nMayenne.  “To go and fight.”  “Pray reflect upon, what you are going to\r\ndo.”  “Reflections that I haven’t made in a quarter of an hour I\r\nshouldn’t make in a year.”  Mounting at once, the leader and his\r\nsquadrons arrived at midnight at the gates of Vimory; they found,\r\nit is said, the Germans drunk, asleep, and scattered; according to the\r\nreporters on the side of the League, the victory of Guise was complete;\r\nhe took from the Germans twenty-eight hundred horses: the Protestants\r\nsaid that the body he charged were nothing but a lot of horse-boys, and\r\nthat the two flags he took had for device nothing but a sponge and a\r\ncurrycomb.  But fifteen days later, on the 11th of November, at Auneau,\r\nnear Chartres, Guise gained an indisputable and undisputed victory over\r\nthe Germans; and their general, Baron Dohna, and some of his officers\r\nonly saved themselves by cutting their way through sword in hand.  The\r\nSwiss, being discouraged, and seeing in the army of Henry III. eight\r\nthousand of their countrymen, who were serving in it not, like\r\nthemselves, as adventurers, but under the flags and with the\r\nauthorization of their cantons, separated from the Germans and withdrew,\r\nafter receiving from Henry III.  four hundred thousand crowns as the\r\nprice of their withdrawal.  In Burgundy, in Champagne, and in Orleanness,\r\nthe campaign terminated to the honor of Guise, which Henry III. was far\r\nfrom regarding as a victory for himself.\r\n\r\nBut almost at the same time at which the League obtained this success in\r\nthe provinces of the east and centre, it experienced in those of the\r\nsouth-west a reverse more serious for the Leaguers than the Duke of\r\nGuise’s victory had been fortunate for them.  Henry III. had given the\r\ncommand of his army south of the Loire to one of his favorites, Anne,\r\nDuke of Joyeuse, a brilliant, brave, and agreeable young man, whose\r\nfortunes he had advanced beyond measure, to the extent of marrying him to\r\nMarguerite de Lorraine, the queen’s sister, and raising for him the\r\nviscountship of Joyeuse to a duchy-peerage, giving him rank, too, after\r\nthe princes of the blood and before the dukes of old creation.  Joyeuse\r\nwas at the head of six thousand foot, two thousand horse, and six pieces\r\nof cannon.  He entered Poitou and marched towards the Dordogne, whilst\r\nthe King of Navarre was at La Rochelle, engaged in putting into order two\r\npieces of cannon, which formed the whole of his artillery, and in\r\nassembling round him his three cousins, the Prince of Conde, the Count of\r\nSoissons, and the Prince of Conti, that he might head the whole house of\r\nBourbon at the moment when he was engaging seriously in the struggle with\r\nthe house of Valois and the house of Lorraine.  A small town, Coutras,\r\nsituated at the confluence of the two rivers of L’Isle and La Dronne, in\r\nthe Gironde, offered the two parties an important position to occupy.\r\n“According to his wont,” says the Duke of Aumale in his _Histoire des\r\nPrinces de Conde,_ “the Bearnese was on horseback whilst his adversary\r\nwas banqueting.”  He outstripped Joyeuse; and when the latter drew near\r\nto Contras, he found the town occupied by the Protestant advance-guard,\r\nand had barely time to fall back upon La Roche-Chalais.  The battle began\r\non the 20th of October, 1587, shortly after sunrise.  We will here borrow\r\nthe equally dramatic and accurate account of it given by the Duke of\r\nAumale: “At this solemn moment the King of Navarre calls to his side his\r\ncousins and his principal officers; then, in his manly and sonorous\r\nvoice, he addresses his men-at-arms: ‘My friends, here is a quarry for\r\nyou very different from your past prizes.  It is a brand-new bridegroom,\r\nwith his marriage-money still in his coffers; and all the cream of the\r\ncourtiers are with him.  Will you let yourselves go down before this\r\nhandsome dancing-master and his minions?  No, they are ours; I see it by\r\nyour eagerness to fight.  Still we must all of us understand that the\r\nevent is in the hands of God.  Pray we Him to aid us.  This deed will be\r\nthe greatest that we ever did; the glory will be to God, the service to\r\nour sovereign lord the king, the honor to ourselves, and the benefit to\r\nthe state.’  Henry uncovers; the clergymen Chandieu and Damours intone\r\nthe army’s prayer, and the men-at-arms repeat in chorus the twenty-fourth\r\nversicle of the hundred and eighteenth Psalm: ‘This is the day which the\r\nLord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.’  As they were\r\nhastening each to his post, the king detains his cousins a moment.\r\n‘Gentlemen,’ he shouts, ‘I have just one thing to say: remember that you\r\nare of the house of Bourbon; and, as God liveth, I will let you see that\r\nI am your senior.’  ‘And we will show you some good juniors,’ answered\r\nConde.”\r\n\r\nBefore midday the battle was won and the royalist army routed, but\r\nnot without having made a valiant stand.  During the action, D’Epinay\r\nSaint-Luc, one of the bravest royalist soldiers, met the Duke of Joyeuse\r\nalready wounded.  “What’s to be done?” he asked.  “Die,” answered\r\nJoyeuse; and a few moments afterwards, as he was moving away some paces\r\nto the rear in order to get near to his artillery, says D’Aubigne, he was\r\nsurrounded by several Huguenots, who recognized him.  “There are a\r\nhundred-thousand crowns to be gained,” he shouted; but rage was more\r\npowerful than cupidity, and one of them shattered his skull with a\r\npistol-shot.  “His body was taken to the king’s quarters: there it lay,\r\nin the evening, upon a table in the very room where the conqueror’s\r\nsupper had been prepared: but the King of Navarre ordered all who were in\r\nthe chamber to go out, had his supper things removed else-whither, and,\r\nwith every mark of respect, committed the remains of the vanquished to\r\nthe care of Viscount de Turenne, his near relative.  Henry showed a\r\nsimple and modest joy at his splendid triumph.  It was five and twenty\r\nyears since the civil war commenced, and he was the first Protestant\r\ngeneral who had won a pitched battle; he had to regret only\r\ntwenty-five killed, whereas the enemy had lost more than three thousand,\r\nand had abandoned to him their cannon, together with twenty-nine flags or\r\nstandards.  The victory was so much the more glorious in that it was\r\ngained over an army superior in numbers and almost equal in quality.\r\nIt was owing to the king’s valor, decision, vigilance, quick eye,\r\ncomprehension of tactics, and that creative instinct which he brought\r\ninto application in politics as well as in war, and which was destined to\r\nrender him so happily inspired in the beautiful defensive actions of\r\nArques, at the affair of Ivry, and on so many other occasions.”\r\n [_Histoire des Princes de Conde, &c.,_ by M. le Due D’Aumale, t. ii.\r\npp. 164-177.]\r\n\r\nAnd what was Henry III., King of France, doing whilst two great parties\r\nand two great men were thus carrying on, around his throne and in his\r\nname, so passionate a war, on the one side to maintain the despotic unity\r\nof Catholic Christianism, and on the other to win religious liberty for\r\nChristian Protestantism?  We will borrow here the words of the most\r\nenlightened and most impartial historian of the sixteenth century, M. de\r\nThou; if we acted upon our own personal impressions alone, there would be\r\ndanger of appearing too severe towards a king whom we profoundly despise.\r\n\r\n“After having staid some time in Bourbonness, Henry III. went to Lyons in\r\norder to be within hail of his two favorites, Joyeuse and Epernon, who\r\nwere each on the march with an army.  Whilst he was at Lyons as\r\nunconcerned as if all the realm were enjoying perfect peace, he took to\r\ncollecting those little dogs which are thought so much of in that town.\r\nEverybody was greatly surprised to see a King of France, in the midst of\r\nso terrible a war and in extreme want of money, expending upon such\r\npleasures all the time he had at disposal and all the sums he could\r\nscrape together.  How lavish soever this prince may have been, yet, if\r\ncomparison be made between the expenditure upon the royal household and\r\nthat incurred at Lyons for dogs, the latter will be found infinitely\r\nhigher than the former; without counting expenses for hunting-dogs and\r\nbirds, which always come to a considerable sum in the households of\r\nkings, it cost him, every year, more than a hundred thousand gold crowns\r\nfor little Lyonnese dogs; and he maintained at his court, with large\r\nsalaries, a multitude of men and women who had nothing to do but to feed\r\nthem.  He also spent large sums in monkeys, parrots, and other creatures\r\nfrom foreign countries, of which he always kept a great number.\r\nSometimes he got tired of them, and gave them all away then his passion\r\nfor such creatures returned, and they had to be found for him at no\r\nmatter what cost.  Since I am upon the subject of this prince’s\r\nattachment to matters anything but worthy of the kingly majesty, I will\r\nsay a word about his passion for those miniatures which were to be found\r\nin manuscript prayer-books, and which, before the practice of printing,\r\nwere done by the most skilful painters.  Henry III. seemed to buy such\r\nworks, intended for princes and laid by in cabinets of curiosities, only\r\nto spoil them; as soon as he had them, he cut them out, and then pasted\r\nthem upon the walls of his chapels, as children do.  An incomprehensible\r\ncharacter of mind: in certain things, capable of upholding his rank; in\r\nsome, rising above his position; in others, sinking below childishness.”\r\n [_Histoire universelle de F. A. de Thou,_ t. ix.  p. 599.]\r\n\r\nA mind and character incomprehensible indeed, if corruption, lassitude,\r\nlistlessness, and fear would not explain the existence of everything that\r\nis abnormal and pitiable about human nature in a feeble, cold, and\r\nselfish creature, excited, and at the same time worn out, by the business\r\nand the pleasures of kingship, which Henry III. could neither do without\r\nnor bear the burden of.  His perplexity was extreme in his relations with\r\nthe other two Henries, who gave, like himself, their name to this war,\r\nwhich was called by contemporaries the war of the three Henries.  The\r\nsuccesses of Henry de Guise and of Henry de Bourbon were almost equally\r\ndisagreeable to Henry de Valois.  It is probable that, if he could have\r\nchosen, he would have preferred those of Henry de Bourbon; if they caused\r\nhim like jealousy, they did not raise in him the same distrust; he knew\r\nthe King of Navarre’s loyalty, and did not suspect him of aiming to\r\nbecome, whilst he himself was living, King of France.  Besides, he\r\nconsidered the Protestants less powerful and less formidable than the\r\nLeaguers.  Henry de Guise, on the contrary, was evidently, in his eyes,\r\nan ambitious conspirator, determined to push his own fortunes on to the\r\nvery crown of France if the chances were favorable to him, and not only\r\narmed with all the power of Catholicism, but urged forward by the\r\npassions of the League, perhaps further and certainly more quickly than\r\nhis own intentions travelled.  Since 1584, the Leaguers had, at Paris,\r\nacquired strong organization amongst the populace; the city had been\r\npartitioned out into five districts under five heads, who, shortly\r\nafterwards, added to themselves eleven others, in order that, in the\r\nsecret council of the association, each amongst the sixteen quarters of\r\nParis might have its representative and director.  Thence the famous\r\nCommittee of Sixteen, which played so great and so formidable a part in\r\nthe history of that period.  It was religious fanaticism and democratic\r\nfanaticism closely united, and in a position to impose their wills upon\r\ntheir most eminent leaders, upon the Duke of Guise himself.\r\n\r\nIn vain did Henry III. attempt to resume some sort of authority in Paris;\r\nhis government, his public and private life, and his person were daily\r\nattacked, insulted, and menaced from the elevation of the pulpit and in\r\nthe public thoroughfares by qualified preachers or mob-orators.  On the\r\n16th of December, 1587, the Sorbonne voted, after a deliberation which,\r\nit was said, was to be kept secret, “that the government might be taken\r\naway from princes who were found not what they ought to be, just as the\r\nadministration of a property from a guardian open to suspicion.”  On the\r\n30th of December, the king summoned to the Louvre his court of Parliament\r\nand the faculty of theology.  “I know of your precious resolution of the\r\n16th of this month,” said he to the Sorbonne; “I have been requested to\r\ntake no notice of it, seeing that it was passed after dinner.  I have no\r\nmind to avenge myself for these outrages, as I might, and as Pope Sixtus\r\nV. did when he sent to the galleys certain Cordeliers for having dared to\r\nslander him in their sermons.  There is not one of you who has not\r\ndeserved as much, and more; but it is my good pleasure to forget all, and\r\nto pardon you, on condition of its not occurring again.  If it should, I\r\nbeg my court of Parliament, here present, to exact exemplary justice, and\r\nsuch as the seditious, like you, may take warning by, so as to mind their\r\nown business.”  At their exit after this address, the Parliament and the\r\nSorbonne, being quite sure that the king would not carry the matter\r\nfurther, withdrew smiling, and saying, “He certainly has spirit, but not\r\nenough of it” (_habet quidem animum, sed non satis animi_).  The Duke of\r\nGuise’s sister, the Duchess of Montpensier, took to getting up and\r\nspreading about all sorts of pamphlets against the king and his\r\ngovernment.  “The king commanded her to quit his city of Paris; she did\r\nnothing of the kind; and three days after she was even brazen enough to\r\nsay that she carried at her waist the scissors which would give a third\r\ncrown to brother Henry de Valois.”  At the close of 1587, the Duke of\r\nGuise made a trip to Rome, “with a suite of five; and he only remained\r\nthree days, so disguised that he was not recognized there, and discovered\r\nhimself to nobody but Cardinal Pelleve, with whom he was in communication\r\nday and night.”  [_Journal de L’Estoile,_ t. i.  p. 345.] Eighteen months\r\npreviously, the cardinal had given a very favorable reception to a case\r\ndrawn up by an advocate in the Parliament of Paris, named David, who\r\nmaintained that, “although the line of the Capets had succeeded to the\r\ntemporal administration of the kingdom of Charlemagne, it had not\r\nsucceeded to the apostolic benediction, which appertained to none but the\r\nposterity of the said Charlemagne, and that, the line of Capet being some\r\nof them possessed by a spirit of giddiness and stupidity, and others\r\nheretic and excommunicated, the time had come for restoring the crown to\r\nthe true heirs,” that is to say, to the house of Lorraine, which claimed\r\nto be issue of Charlemagne.  This case was passed on, it is said, from\r\nRome to Philip II., King of Spain, and M. de Saint-Goard, ambassador of\r\nFrance at Madrid, sent Henry III. a copy of it.  [_Memoires de la Ligue,_\r\nt. i.  pp. 1-7.]\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the truth about this trip to Rome on the part of\r\nthe Duke of Guise, and its influence upon what followed, the chiefs of\r\nthe Leaguers resolved to deal a great blow.  The Lorraine princes and\r\ntheir intimate associates met at Nancy in January, 1588, and decided that\r\na petition should be presented to the king; that he should be called upon\r\nto join himself more openly and in good earnest to the League, and to\r\nremove from offices of consequence all the persons that should be pointed\r\nout to him; that the Holy Inquisition should be established, at any rate\r\nin the good towns; that important places should be put into the hands of\r\nspecified chiefs, who should have the power of constructing\r\nfortifications there; that heretics should be taxed a third, or at the\r\nleast, a fourth of their property as long as the war lasted; and, lastly,\r\nthat the life should be spared of no enemy taken prisoner, unless upon\r\nhis swearing and finding good surety to live as a Catholic, and upon\r\npaying in ready money the worth of his property if it had not already\r\nbeen sold.  These monstrous proposals, drawn up in eleven articles, were\r\nimmediately carried to the king.  He did not reject them, but he demanded\r\nand took time to discuss them with the authors.  The negotiation was\r\nprolonged; the ferment in Paris was redoubled; the king, it was said,\r\nmeant to withdraw; his person must be secured; the Committee of Sixteen\r\ntook measures to that end; one of its members got into his hands the keys\r\nof the gate of St. Denis.  From Soissons, where he was staying, the Duke\r\nof Guise sent to Paris the Count of Brissac, with four other captains of\r\nthe League, to hold themselves in readiness for any event, and he ordered\r\nhis brother the Duke of Aumale to stoutly maintain his garrisons in the\r\nplaces of Picardy, which the king, it was said, meant to take from him.\r\n“If the king leaves Paris,” the duke wrote to Bernard de Mendoza, Philip\r\nII.’s ambassador in France, “I will make him think about returning\r\nthither before he has gone a day’s march towards the Picards.”  Philip\r\nII. made Guise an offer of three hundred thousand crowns, six thousand\r\nlanzknechts, and twelve hundred lances, as soon as he should have broken\r\nwith Henry III.  “The abscess will soon burst,” wrote the ambassador to\r\nthe king his master.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of May, 1588, at eleven P. M., the Duke of Guise set out from\r\nSoissons, after having commended himself to the prayers of the convents\r\nin the town.  He arrived the next morning before Paris, which he entered\r\nabout midday by the gate of St. Martin.  The Leaguers had been expecting\r\nhim for several days.  Though he had covered his head with his cloak, he\r\nwas readily recognized and eagerly cheered; the burgesses left their\r\nhouses and the tradesmen their shops to see him and follow him, shouting,\r\n“Hurrah! for Guise; hurrah! for the pillar of the church!”  The crowd\r\nincreased at every step.  He arrived in front of the palace of Catherine\r\nde’ Medici, who had not expected him, and grew pale at sight of him.\r\n“My dear cousin,” said she to him, “I am very glad to see you, but I\r\nshould have been better pleased at another time.”  “Madame, I am come to\r\nclear myself from all the calumnies of my enemies; do me the honor to\r\nconduct me to the king yourself.”  Catherine lost no time in giving the\r\nking warning by one of her secretaries.  On receipt of this notice, Henry\r\nIII., who had at first been stolid--and silent, rose abruptly from his\r\nchair.  “Tell my lady mother that, as she wishes to present the Duke of\r\nGuise to me, I will receive him in the chamber of the queen my wife.”\r\n The envoy departed.  The king, turning to one of his officers, Colonel\r\nAlphonso Corso, said to him, “M. de Guise has just arrived at Paris,\r\ncontrary to my orders.  What would you do in my place?”  “Sir, do you\r\nhold the Duke of Guise for friend or enemy?”  The king, without speaking,\r\nreplied by a significant gesture.  “If it please your, Majesty to give me\r\nthe order, I will this very day lay the duke’s head at your feet.”  The\r\nthree councillors who happened to be there cried out.  The king held his\r\npeace.  During this conversation at the Louvre, the Duke of Guise was\r\nadvancing along the streets, dressed in a doublet of white damask, a\r\ncloak of black cloth, and boots of buffalo-hide; he walked on foot,\r\nbareheaded, at the side of the queen-mother in a sedan-chair.  He was\r\ntall, with fair clustering hair and piercing eyes; and his scar added to\r\nhis martial air.  The mob pressed upon his steps; flowers were thrown to\r\nhim from the windows; some, adoring him as a saint, touched him with\r\nchaplets which they afterwards kissed; a young girl darted towards him,\r\nand, removing her mask, kissed him, saying, “Brave prince, since you are\r\nhere, we are all saved.”  Guise, with a dignified air, “saluted and\r\ndelighted everybody,” says a witness, “with eye, and gesture, and\r\nspeech.”  “By his side,” said Madame de Retz, “the other princes are\r\ncommoners.”  “The Huguenots,” said another, “become Leaguers at the very\r\nsight of him.”  On arriving at the Louvre, he traversed the court between\r\ntwo rows of soldiers, the archers on duty in the hall, and the forty-five\r\ngentlemen of the king’s chamber at the top of the staircase.  “What\r\nbrings you hither?” said the king, with difficulty restraining his anger.\r\n“I entreat your Majesty to believe in my fidelity, and not allow yourself\r\nto go by the reports of my enemies.”  “Did I not command you not to come\r\nat this season so full of suspicions, but to wait yet a while?”\r\n\r\n“Sir, I was not given to understand that my coming would be disagreeable\r\nto you.”  Catherine drew near, and, in a low tone, told her son of the\r\ndemonstrations of which the duke had been the object on his way.  Guise\r\nwas received in the chamber of the queen, Louise de Vaudemont, who was\r\nconfined to her bed by indisposition; he chatted with her a moment, and,\r\nsaluting the king, retired without being attended by any one of the\r\nofficers of the court.  Henry III. confined himself to telling him that\r\nresults should speak for the sincerity of his words.\r\n\r\nGuise returned to his house in the Faubourg St. Antoine, still\r\naccompanied by an eager and noisy crowd, but somewhat disquieted at heart\r\nboth by the king’s angry reception and the people’s enthusiastic welcome.\r\nBrave as he was, he was more ambitious in conception than bold in\r\nexecution, and he had not made up his mind to do all that was necessary\r\nto attain the end he was pursuing.  The committee of Sixteen, his\r\nconfidants, and all the staff of the League, met at his house during the\r\nevening and night between the 9th and 10th of May, preparing for the\r\nmorrow’s action without well knowing what it was to be, proposing various\r\nplans, collecting arms, and giving instructions to their agents amongst\r\nthe populace.  An agitation of the same sort prevailed at the Louvre; the\r\nking, too, was deliberating with his advisers as to what he should do on\r\nthe morrow: Guise would undoubtedly present himself at his morning levee;\r\nshould he at once rid himself of him by the poniards of the five and\r\nforty bravoes which the Duke of Epernon had enrolled in Gascony for his\r\nservice?  Or would it be best to summon to Paris some troops, French and\r\nSwiss, to crush the Parisian rebels and the adventurers that had hurried\r\nup from all parts to their aid?  But on the 10th of May, Guise went to\r\nthe Louvre with four hundred gentlemen well armed with breastplates and\r\nweapons under their cloaks.  The king did nothing; no more did Guise.\r\nThe two had a long conversation in the queen-mother’s garden; but it led\r\nto no result.  On the 11th of May, in the evening, the provost of\r\ntradesmen, Hector de Perreuse, assembled the town-council and those of\r\nthe district-colonels on whom he had reliance to receive the king’s\r\norders.  Orders came to muster the burgher companies of certain\r\ndistricts, and send them to occupy certain positions that had been\r\ndetermined upon.  They mustered slowly and incompletely, and some not at\r\nall; and scarcely had they arrived when several left the posts which had\r\nbeen assigned to them.  The king, being informed of this sluggishness,\r\nsent for the regiment of the French Guards, and for four thousand Swiss\r\ncantoned in the outskirts of Paris; and he himself mounted his horse, on\r\nthe 12th of May, in the morning, to go and receive them at the gate of\r\nSt. Honord.  These troops “filed along, without fife or drum, towards the\r\ncemetery of the Innocents.”  The populace regarded them as they passed\r\nwith a feeling of angry curiosity and uneasy amazement.  When all the\r\ncorps had arrived at the appointed spot, “they put themselves in motion\r\ntowards different points, now making a great noise with their drums and\r\nfifes, which marvellously astonished the inhabitants of the quarter.”\r\n Noise provokes noise.  “In continently,” says L’Estoile, “everybody\r\nseizes his arms, goes out on guard in the streets and cantons; in less\r\nthan no time chains are stretched across and barricades made at the\r\ncorners of the streets; the mechanic leaves his tools, the tradesman his\r\nbusiness, the University their books, the attorneys their bags, the\r\nadvocates their bands; the presidents and councillors themselves take\r\nhalberds in hand; nothing is heard but shouts, murmurs, and the seditious\r\nspeeches that heat and alarm a people.”  The tocsin sounded everywhere;\r\nbarricades sprang up in the twinkling of an eye; they were made within\r\nthirty paces of the Louvre.  The royal troops were hemmed in where they\r\nstood, and deprived of the possibility of moving; the Swiss, being\r\nattacked, lost fifty men, and surrendered, holding up their chaplets and\r\nexclaiming that they were good Catholics.  It was thought sufficient to\r\ndisarm the French Guards.  The king, remaining stationary at the Louvre,\r\nsent his marshals to parley with the people massed in the thoroughfares;\r\nthe queen-mother had herself carried over the barricades in order to go\r\nto Guise’s house and attempt some negotiation with him.  He received her\r\ncoldly, demanding that the king should appoint him lieutenant-general of\r\nthe kingdom, declare the Huguenot princes incapacitated from succeeding\r\nto the throne, and assemble the states-general.  At the approach of\r\nevening, Guise determined to go himself and assume the conqueror’s air by\r\nputting a stop to the insurrection.  He issued from his house on\r\nhorseback, unarmed, with a white wand in his hand; he rode through the\r\ndifferent districts, exhorting the inhabitants to keep up their\r\nbarricades, whilst remaining on the defensive and leaving him to complete\r\ntheir work.  He was greeted on all sides with shouts of “Hurrah! for\r\nGuise!” “You wrong me, my friends,” said he; “you should shout, ‘Hurrah!\r\nfor the king!’”  He had the French Guards and the Swiss set at liberty;\r\nand they defiled before him, arms lowered and bareheaded, as before their\r\npreserver.  Next morning, May 13, he wrote to D’Entragues, governor of\r\nOrleans, “Notify our friends to come to us in the greatest haste\r\npossible, with horses and arms, but without baggage, which they will\r\neasily be able to do, for I believe that the roads are open hence to you.\r\nI have defeated the Swiss, and cut in pieces a part of the king’s guards,\r\nand I hold the Louvre invested so closely that I will render good account\r\nof whatsoever there is in it.  This is so great a victory that it will be\r\nremembered forever.”  That same day, the provost of tradesmen and the\r\nroyalist sheriffs repaired to the Louvre, and told the king that, without\r\ngreat and immediate concessions, they could not answer for anything; the\r\nLouvre was not in a condition of defence; there were no troops to be\r\ndepended upon for resistance, no provisions, no munitions; the investment\r\nwas growing closer and closer every hour, and the assault might commence\r\nat any instant.  Henry III. sent his mother once more to the Duke of\r\nGuise, and himself went out about four o’clock, dressed in a country suit\r\nand scantily attended, as if for a walk in the Tuileries.  Catherine\r\nfound the duke as inflexible as he had been the day before.  He\r\nperemptorily insisted upon all the conditions he had laid down already,\r\nthe lieutenant-generalship of the kingdom for himself, the unity of the\r\nCatholic faith, forfeiture on the part of the King of Navarre and every\r\nother Huguenot prince as heir to the throne, perpetual banishment of the\r\nking’s favorites, and convocation of the states-general.  “The king,” he\r\nsaid, “purposes to destroy all the grandees of the kingdom and to harry\r\nall those who oppose his wishes and the elevation of his minions; it is\r\nmy duty and my interest to take all the measures necessary for my own\r\npreservation and that of the people.”  Catherine yielded on nearly every\r\npoint, at the same time, however, continually resuming and prolonging the\r\ndiscussion.  One of the duke’s most trusty confidants, Francis de\r\nMainville, entered and whispered in his ear.  “Madame,” cried the duke,\r\n“whilst your Majesty has been amusing me here, the king is off from Paris\r\nto harry me and destroy me!”  Henry III., indeed, had taken horse at the\r\nTuileries, and, attended by his principal councillors, unbooted and\r\ncloakless, had issued from the New gate, and set out on the road to St.\r\nCloud.  Equipping him in haste, his squire, Du Halde, had put his spur on\r\nwrong, and would have set it right, but, “That will do,” said the king;\r\n“I am not going to see my mistress; I have a longer journey to make.”  It\r\nis said that the corps on guard at the Nesle gate fired from a distance a\r\nsalute of arquebuses after the fugitive king, and that a crowd assembled\r\non the other bank of the river shouted insults after him.  At the height\r\nof Chaillot Henry pulled up, and turning round towards Paris, “Ungrateful\r\ncity,” he cried, “I have loved thee more than my own wife; I will not\r\nenter thy walls again but by the breach.”\r\n\r\nIt is said that on hearing of the Duke of Guise’s sudden arrival at\r\nParis, Pope Sixtus V. exclaimed, “Ah! what rashness!  To thus go and put\r\nhimself in the hands of a prince he has so outraged!”  And some days\r\nafterwards, on the news that the king had received the Duke of Guise and\r\nnothing had come of it, “Ah, dastard prince! poor creature of a prince,\r\nto have let such a chance escape him of getting rid of a man who seems\r\nborn to be his destruction!” [_De Thou,_ t. x.  p. 266.]\r\n\r\nWhen the king was gone, Guise acted the master in Paris.  He ordered the\r\nimmediate delivery into his hands of the Bastille, the arsenal, and the\r\ncastle of Vincennes.  Ornano, governor of the Bastille, sent an offer to\r\nthe king, who had arrived at Chartres, to defend it to the last\r\nextremity.  “I will not expose to so certain a peril a brave man who may\r\nbe necessary to me elsewhere,” replied the king.  Guise caused to be\r\nelected at Paris a new town-council and a new provost of tradesmen, all\r\ntaken from amongst the most ardent Leaguers.  He at the same time exerted\r\nhimself to restore order; he allowed all royalists who wished to depart\r\nto withdraw to Chartres; he went in person and pressed the premier\r\npresident of Parliament, Achille de Harlay, to resume the course of\r\njustice.  “It is great pity, sir,” said Harlay, “when the servant drives\r\nout the master; this assembly is founded (seated) on the fleur-de-lis;\r\nbeing established by the king, it can act only for his service.  We will\r\nall lose our lives to a man rather than give way a whit to the contrary.”\r\n “I have been in many battles,” said Guise, as he went out, “in assaults\r\nand encounters the most dangerous in the world; and I have never been so\r\novercome as at my reception by this personage.”  At the same time that he\r\nwas trying to exercise authority and restore order, unbridled violence\r\nand anarchy were making head around him; the Sixteen and their friends\r\ndischarged from the smallest offices, civil or religious, whoever was not\r\ndevoted to them; they changed all the captains and district-officers of\r\nthe city militia; they deposed all the incumbents, all the ecclesiastics\r\nwhom they termed Huguenots and policists; the pulpits of Christians\r\nbecame the platforms of demagogues; the preachers Guiticestre, Boucher,\r\nRose, John Prevost, Aubry, Pigenat, Cueilly, Pelletier, and a host of\r\nothers whose names have fallen into complete obscurity, were the popular\r\napostles, the real firebrands of the troubles of the League, says\r\nPasquier; there was scarcely a chapel where there were not several\r\nsermons a day.  “You know not your strength,” they kept repeating to\r\ntheir auditors: “Paris knows not what she is worth; she has wealth enough\r\nto make war upon four kings. France is sick, and she will never recover\r\nfrom that sickness till she has a draught of French blood given her.\r\n.  .  .  If you receive Henry de Valois into your towns, make up your\r\nminds to see your preachers massacred, your sheriffs hanged, your women\r\nviolated, and the gibbets garnished with your members.”  One of these\r\nraving orators, Claude Trahy, provincial of the Cordeliers, devoted\r\nhimself to hounding on the populace of Auxerre against their bishop,\r\nJames Amyot, the translator of Plutarch, whom he reproached with “having\r\ncommunicated with Henry III. and administered to him the eucharist;”\r\n brother John Moresin, one of Trahy’s subalterns, went about brandishing a\r\nhalberd in the public place at Auxerre, and shouting, “Courage, lads!\r\nmessire Amyot is a wicked man, worse than Henry de Valois; he has\r\nthreatened to have our master Trahy hanged, but he will repent it;” and,\r\n“at the voice of this madman, there hurried up vine-dressers, boatmen,\r\nand marchandeaux (costermongers), a whole angry mob, who were for having\r\nAmyot’s throat cut, and Trahy made bishop in his stead.”\r\n\r\nWhilst the blind passions of fanatics and demagogues were thus let loose,\r\nthe sensible and clear-sighted spirits, the earnest and moderate\r\nroyalists, did not all of them remain silent and motionless.  After the\r\nappearance of the letters written in 1588 by the Duke of Guise to explain\r\nand justify his conduct in this crisis, a grandson of Chancellor de\r\nl’Hospital, Michael Hurault, Sieur du Fay, published a document, entitled\r\nFrank and Free Discourse upon the Condition of France, one of the most\r\njudicious and most eloquent pamphlets of the sixteenth century, a\r\nprofound criticism upon the acts of the Duke of Guise, their causes and\r\nconsequences, and a true picture of the falsehoods and servitude into\r\nwhich an eminent man may fall when he makes himself the tool of a popular\r\nfaction in the hope of making that faction the tool of his personal\r\nambition.  But even the men who were sufficiently enlightened and\r\nsufficiently courageous to tell the League and its leader plain truths\r\nspoke only rather late in the day, and at first without giving their\r\nnames; the document written by L’Hospital’s grandson did not appear until\r\n1591, after the death of Henry III. and Henry de Guise, and it remained\r\nanonymous for some time.  One cannot be astonished at such timidity;\r\nGuise himself was timid before the Leaguers, and he always ended by\r\nyielding to them in essentials, after having attempted to resist them\r\nupon such and such an incidental point.  His own people accused him of\r\nlacking boldness; and his sister, the Duchess of Montpensier, openly\r\npatronized the most violent preachers, whilst boasting that she wielded\r\nmore influence through them than her brother by his armies.  Henry III.,\r\nunder stress of his enemies’ zeal and his own servants’ weakness,\r\nCatherine de’ Medici included, after having fled from Paris and taken\r\nrefuge at Chartres to escape the triumph of the Barricades, once more\r\nbegan to negotiate, that is, to capitulate with the League; he issued at\r\nRouen, on the 19th of July, 1588, an edict in eleven articles, whereby he\r\ngranted more than had been demanded, and more than he had promised in\r\n1585 by the treaty of Nemours; over and above the measures contained in\r\nthat treaty against the Huguenots, in respect of the present and the\r\nfuture, he added four fresh surety-towns, amongst others Bourges and\r\nOrleans, to those of which the Leaguers were to remain in possession.\r\nHe declared, moreover, “that no investigation should be made into any\r\nunderstandings, associations, and other matters into which our Catholic\r\nsubjects might have entered together; inasmuch as they have given us to\r\nunderstand and have informed us that what they did was but owing to the\r\nzeal they felt for the preservation and maintenance of the Catholic\r\nreligion.”  By thus releasing the League from all responsibility for the\r\npast, and by giving this new treaty the name of edict of union, Henry\r\nIII. flattered himself, it is said, that he was thus putting himself at\r\nthe head of a new grand Catholic League which would become royalist\r\nagain, inasmuch as the king was granting it all it had desired.  The\r\nedict of union was enregistered at the Parliament of Paris on the 21st of\r\nJuly.  The states-general were convoked for the 15th of October\r\nfollowing.  “On Tuesday, August 2, his Majesty,” says L’Estoile, “being\r\nentertained by the Duke of Guise during his dinner, asked him for drink,\r\nand then said to him, ‘To whom shall we drink?’  ‘To whom you please,\r\nsir,’ answered the duke; ‘it is for your Majesty to command.’  ‘Cousin,’\r\nsaid the king, ‘drink we to our good friends the Huguenots.’  ‘It is well\r\nsaid, sir,’ answered the duke.  ‘And to our good barricaders,’ said the\r\nking; ‘let us not forget them.’  Whereupon the duke began to laugh a\r\nlittle,” adds L’Estoile, “but a sort of laugh that did not go beyond the\r\nknot of the throat, being dissatisfied at the novel union the king was\r\npleased to make of the Huguenots with the barricaders.”  What must have\r\nto some extent reassured the Duke of Guise was, that a Te Deum was\r\ncelebrated at Notre-Dame for the King of Navarre’s exclusion from all\r\nright to the crown, and that, on the 14th of August Henry de Guise was\r\nappointed generalissimo of the royal armies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Castle of Blois----428]\r\n\r\nThe states-general met at Blois on the 16th of October, 1588.  They\r\nnumbered five hundred and five deputies; one hundred and ninety-one of\r\nthe third estate, one hundred and eighty of the noblesse, one hundred and\r\nthirty-four of the clergy.  The king had given orders “to conduct each\r\ndeputy as they arrived to his cabinet, that he might see, hear, and know\r\nthem all personally.”  When the five hundred and five deputies had taken\r\ntheir places in the hall, the Duke of Guise went to fetch the king, who\r\nmade his entry attended by the princes of the blood, and opened the\r\nsession with the dignity and easy grace which all the Valois seemed to\r\nhave inherited from Francis I.  The Duke of Guise, in a coat of white\r\nsatin, was seated at the king’s feet, as high steward of his household,\r\nscanning the whole assembly with his piercing glance, as if to keep watch\r\nover those who were in his service.  “He seemed,” says a contemporary,\r\n“by a single flash of his eye to fortify them in the hope of the\r\nadvancement of his designs; his fortunes, and his greatness, and to say\r\nto them, without speaking, I see you.”  The king’s speech was long, able,\r\nwell delivered, and very much applauded, save by Guise himself and his\r\nparticular friends; the firmness of tone had displeased them, and one\r\nsentence excited in them a discontent which they had found difficulty in\r\nrestraining: certain grandees of my kingdom have formed such leagues and\r\nassociations as, in every well-ordered monarchy, are crimes of high\r\ntreason, without the sovereign’s permission.  But, showing my wonted\r\nindulgence, I am quite willing to let bygones be bygones in this respect.\r\nGuise grew pale at these words.  On leaving the royal session, he got his\r\nprivate committee to decide that the Cardinal of Guise and the Archbishop\r\nof Lyons should go to see the king, and beg him to abandon the printing\r\nof his speech, and meanwhile Guise himself sent to the printer’s to stop\r\nthe immediate publication.  Discussion took place next day in the king’s\r\ncabinet; and a threat was held out to him that a portion of the deputies\r\nwould quit the meeting of states.  The queen-mother advised her son to\r\ncompromise.  The king yielded, according to his custom, and gave\r\nauthority for cutting out the strongest expressions, amongst others those\r\njust quoted.  “The correction was accordingly made,” says M. Picot, the\r\nlatest and most able historian of the states-general, “and Henry III.\r\nhad to add this new insult to all that were rankling at the bottom of his\r\nheart since the affair of the Barricades.”\r\n\r\nThis was, for the Duke of Guise, a first trial of his power, and great\r\nwas his satisfaction at this first success.  On leaving the opening\r\nsession of the states-general, he wrote to the Spanish ambassador\r\nMendoza, “I handled our states so well that I made them resolve to\r\nrequire confirmation of the edict of union (of July 21 preceding) as\r\nfundamental law of the state.  The king refused to do so, in rather sharp\r\nterms, to the deputies who brought the representation before him, and\r\nfrom that it is presumed that he inclines towards a peace with the\r\nheretics.  But, at last, he was so pressed by the states, the which were\r\notherwise on the point of breaking up, that he promised to swear the\r\nedict and have it sworn before entering upon consideration of any\r\nmatter.”\r\n\r\nThe next day but one, in fact, on the 18th of October, at the second\r\nsession of the states-general, “the edict of July 21 was read and\r\npublished with the greatest solemnity; the king swore to maintain it in\r\nterms calculated to dissipate all anxieties on the part of the Catholics.\r\nThe deputies swore after him.  The Archbishop of Bourges delivered an\r\naddress on the sanctity of oaths, and those present began to think the\r\nsession over, when the king rose a second time to recommend the deputies\r\nnot to leave Blois before the papers were drawn up and the ordinances\r\nmade.  He reminded them that at the last assembly of the states the\r\nsuggestions and counsels of the three estates had been so ill carried out\r\nthat, instead of a reformation and an establishment of good laws,\r\neverything had been thrown into confusion.  Accordingly the king added to\r\nthis suggestion a solemn oath that he would not budge from the city until\r\nhe had made an edict, sacred and inviolable.  The enthusiasm of the\r\ndeputies was at its height; a rush took place to the church of St.\r\nSauveur to chant a Te Deum.  All the princes were there to give thanks to\r\nGod.  Never were king, court, and people so joyous.”  The Duke of Guise\r\nwrote to the Spanish ambassador, “At length we have, in full assembly of\r\nthe states, had our edict of union solemnly sworn and established as\r\nfundamental law of this realm, having surmounted all the difficulties and\r\nhinderances which the king was pleased to throw in the way; I found\r\nmyself four or five times on the point of rupture: but I was verily\r\nassisted by so many good men.”\r\n\r\nAfter as well as before the opening of the states-general, the friends of\r\nthe Duke of Guise were far from having, all of them, the same confidence\r\nthat he had in his position and in his success.  “Stupid owl of a\r\nLorrainer!” said Sieur de Vins, commanding, on behalf of the League, in\r\nDauphiny, on reading the duke’s despatches, “has he so little sense as to\r\nbelieve that a king whose crown he, by dissimulating, has been wanting to\r\ntake away, is not dissimulating in turn to take away his life?”  “As they\r\nare so thick together,” said M. de Vins’ sister, when she knew that the\r\nDuke of Guise was at Blois with the king, “you will hear, at the very\r\nfirst opportunity, that one or the other has killed his fellow.”  Guise\r\nhimself was no stranger to this idea.  “We are not without warnings from\r\nall quarters that there is a design of attempting my life,” he wrote on\r\nthe 21st of September, 1588: “but I have, thank God, so provided against\r\nit, both by the gathering I have made of a good number of my friends, and\r\nin having, by presents and money, secured a portion of those whose\r\nservices are relied upon for the execution of it, that, if once things\r\nbegin, I shall finish more roughly than I did at Paris.”\r\n\r\nAfter the opening of the states-general and the success he obtained\r\nthereat, Guise appeared, if not more anxious, at any rate more attentive\r\nto the warnings he received.  On the 10th of December, 1588, he wrote to\r\nCommander Moreo, confidential agent from the King of Spain to him, “You\r\ncannot imagine what alarms have been given me since your departure.  I\r\nhave so well provided against them that my enemies have not seen their\r\nway to attempting anything.  .  .  .  But expenses have grown upon me to\r\nsuch an extent that I have great need of your prompt assistance.  .  .  .\r\nI have now so much credit with this assembly that I have hitherto made it\r\ndance to my tune, and I hope that as to what remains to be decreed I\r\nshall be quite able to maintain the same authority.”  Some of his\r\npartisans advised him to go away for a while to Orleans; but he\r\nabsolutely refused, repeating, with the Archbishop of Lyons, “He who\r\nleaves the game loses it.”  One evening, in a little circle of intimates,\r\non the 21st of December, a question arose whether it would not be\r\nadvisable to prevent the king’s designs by striking at his person.  The\r\nCardinal of Guise begged his brother to go away, assuring him that his\r\nown presence would suffice for the direction of affairs: but, “They are\r\nin such case, my friend,” said the Balafre, “that, if I saw death coming\r\nin at the window, I would not consent to go out by the door to avoid it.”\r\n His cousin, the Duke of Elbeuf, paid him a visit at night to urge him to\r\nwithdraw himself from the plot hatched against him.  “If it were\r\nnecessary to lose my life in order to reap the proximate fruits of the\r\nstates’ good resolution,” said Guise, “that is what I have quite made up\r\nmy mind to.  Though I had a hundred lives, I would devote them all to the\r\nservice of God and His church, and to the relief of the poor people for\r\nwhom I feel the greatest pity;” then, touching the Duke of Elbeuf upon\r\nthe shoulder, he said, “Go to bed, cousin;” and, taking away his hand and\r\nlaying it upon his own heart, he added, “Here is the doublet of\r\ninnocence.”  On the evening of the 22d of December, 1588, when Charlotte\r\nde Semblancay, Marchioness of Noirmoutiers, to whom he was tenderly\r\nattached, pressed him to depart, or at any rate not to be present at the\r\ncouncil next day, the only answer he made her was to hum the following\r\nditty, by Desportes, a poet of the day:--\r\n\r\n               “My little Rose, a little spell\r\n               Of absence changed that heart of thine;\r\n               And I, who know the change full well,\r\n               Have found another place for mine.\r\n               No more such fair but fickle she\r\n               Shall find me her obedient;\r\n               And, flighty shepherdess, we’ll see\r\n               Which of the twain will first repent.”\r\n\r\nHenry III.  was scarcely less disturbed, but in quite a different way,\r\nthan the Duke of Guise.  For a long time past he had been thinking about\r\ngetting rid of the latter, just as he had thought for a long time, twenty\r\nyears before, about getting rid of Admiral de Coligny; but since the date\r\nof his escape from the popular rising on the day of the Barricades, he\r\nhad hoped that, thanks to the adoption of the edict of union and to the\r\nconvocation of the states-general, he would escape the yoke of the Duke\r\nof Guise.  He saw every day that he had been mistaken; the League, and\r\nconsequently the Duke of Guise, had more power than he with the\r\nstates-general; in vain had the king changed nearly all his ministers; in\r\nvain had he removed his principal favorite, the Duke of Epernon, from the\r\ngovernment of Normandy to that of Provence; he did not obtain from the\r\nstates-general what he demanded, that is, the money he wanted; and the\r\nstates required of him administrative reforms, sound enough at bottom,\r\nbut suggested by the Duke of Guise with an interested object, and\r\ncalculated to shackle the kingly authority even more than could be done\r\nby Guise himself directly.  At the same time that Guise was urging on the\r\nstates-general in this path, he demanded to be made constable, not by the\r\nking any longer, but by the states themselves.  The kingship was thus\r\nbeing squeezed between the haughty supremacy of the great lords,\r\nsubstitutes for the feudal regimen, and the first essays of that free\r\ngovernment which is nowadays called the parliamentary regimen.  Henry\r\nIII. determined with fear and trembling to disembarrass himself of his\r\ntwo rivals, of the Duke of Guise by assassination, and of the\r\nstates-general by packing them off home.  He did not know how intimately\r\nthe two great questions of which the sixteenth century was the great\r\ncradle, the question of religious liberty and that of political liberty,\r\nwere connected one with the other, and would be prosecuted jointly or\r\nsuccessively in the natural progress of Christian civilization, or\r\nthrough what trials kings and people would have to pass before\r\nsucceeding in any effectual solution of them.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of December, 1588, during an entertainment given by Catherine\r\nde’ Medici on the marriage of her niece, Christine de Lorraine, with\r\nFerdinand de’ Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, Henry III. summoned to his\r\ncabinet three of his most intimate and safest confidants, Marshal\r\nd’Aumont, Nicholas d’Angennes, Lord of Rambouillet, and Sieur de Beauvais\r\nNangis.  After having laid before them all the Duke of Guise’s intrigues\r\nagainst him and the perils of the position in which they placed him,\r\n“What ought I to do?” he said; “help me to save myself by some speedy\r\nmeans.”  They asked the king to give them twenty-four hours to answer in.\r\nNext day, the 19th, Sieur de Maintenon, brother of Rambouillet, and\r\nAlphonso Corso d’Ornano Were added to the party; only one of them was of\r\nopinion that the Duke of Guise should at once be arrested and put upon\r\nhis trial; the four others were for a shorter and a surer process, that\r\nof putting the duke to death by a sudden blow.  He is evidently making\r\nwar upon the king, they said; and the king has a right to defend himself.\r\nHenry III., who had his mind made up, asked Crillon, commandant of the\r\nregiment of guards, “Think you that the Duke of Guise deserves death?”\r\n “Yes, sir.”  “Very well; then I choose you to give it him.”  “I am ready\r\nto challenge him.”  “That is not what is wanted; as leader of the\r\nLeague, he is guilty of high treason.”  “Very well, sir; then let him be\r\ntried and executed.”  “But, Crillon, nothing is less certain than his\r\nconviction in a court of law; he must be struck down unexpectedly.”\r\n “Sir, I am a soldier, not an assassin.”  The king did not persist, but\r\nmerely charged Crillon, who promised, to keep the proposal secret.  At\r\nthis very time Guise was requesting the king to give him a constable’s\r\ngrand provost and archers to form his guard in his quality of\r\nlieutenant-general of the kingdom.  The king deferred his reply.\r\nCatherine de’ Medici supported the Lorrainer prince’s request.  “In two\r\nor three days it shall be settled,” said Henry.  He had ordered twelve\r\nponiards from an armorer’s in the city; on the 21st of December he told\r\nhis project to Loignac, an officer of his guards, who was less\r\nscrupulous than Crillon, and undertook to strike the blow, in concert\r\nwith the forty-five trusty guards.  At the council on the 22d of\r\nDecember, the king announced his intention of passing Christmas in\r\nretreat at Notre-Dame de Cleri, and he warned the members of the council\r\nthat next day the session would take place very early in order to\r\ndispose of business before his departure. On the evening of the 22d, the\r\nDuke of Guise, on sitting down at table, found under his napkin a note\r\nto this effect: “The king means to kill you.”  Guise asked for a pen,\r\nwrote at the bottom of the note, “He dare not,” and threw it under the\r\ntable.  Next day, December 23, Henry III., rising at four A. M., after a\r\nnight of great agitation, admitted into his cabinet by a secret\r\nstaircase the nine guards he had chosen, handed them the poniards he had\r\nordered, placed them at the post where they were to wait for the meeting\r\nof the council, and bade Charles d’Entragues to go and request one of\r\nthe royal chaplains “to say mass, that God might give the king grace to\r\nbe able to carry out an enterprise which he hoped would come to an issue\r\nwithin an hour, and on which the safety of France depended.”  Then the\r\nking retired into his closet.  The members of the council arrived in\r\nsuccession; it is said that one of the archers on duty, when he saw the\r\nDuke of Guise mounting the staircase, trod on his foot, as if to give\r\nhim warning; but, if he observed it, Guise made no account of it, any\r\nmore than of all the other hints he had already received.  Before\r\nentering the council-chamber, he stopped at a small oratory connected\r\nwith the chapel, said his prayer, and as he passed the door of the\r\nqueen-mother’s apartments, signified his desire to pay his respects and\r\nhave a few words with her.  Catherine was indisposed, and could not\r\nreceive him.  Some vexation, it is said, appeared in Guise’s face, but\r\nhe said not a word.  On entering the council-chamber he felt cold, asked\r\nto have some fire lighted, and gave orders to his secretary, Pericard,\r\nthe only attendant admitted with him, to go and fetch the silver-gilt\r\nshell he was in the habit of carrying about him with damsons or other\r\npreserves to eat of a morning.  Pericard was some time gone; Guise was\r\nin a hurry, and, “Be kind enough,” he said to M. de Morfontaines, “to\r\nsend word to M. de Saint-Prix [first groom of the chamber to Henry\r\nIII.], that I beg him to let me have a few damsons or a little preserve\r\nof roses, or some trifle of the king’s.”  Four Brignolles plums were\r\nbrought him; and he ate one.  His uneasiness continued; the eye close to\r\nhis scar became moist; according to M. de Thou, he bled at the nose.  He\r\nfelt in his pocket for a handkerchief to use, but could not find one.\r\n“My people,” said he, “have not given me my necessaries this morning:\r\nthere is great excuse for them; they were too much hurried.”  At his\r\nrequest, Saint-Prix had a handkerchief brought to him.  Pericard passed\r\nhis bonbon-box to him, as the guards would not let him enter again.  The\r\nduke took a few plums from it, threw the rest on the table, saying,\r\n“Gentlemen, who will have any?”  and rose up hurriedly upon seeing the\r\nsecretary of state Revol, who came in and said to him, “Sir, the king\r\nwants you; he is in his old cabinet.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as he knew that the Duke of Guise had arrived, and whilst these\r\nlittle incidents were occurring in the council-chamber, Henry III. had in\r\nfact given orders to his secretary Revol to go on his behalf and summon\r\nthe duke.  But Nambu, usher to the council, faithful to his instructions,\r\nhad refused to let anybody, even the king’s secretary, enter the hall.\r\nRevol, of a timid disposition, and impressed, it is said, with the\r\nsinister importance of his commission, returned to the cabinet with a\r\nvery troubled air.  The king, in his turn, was troubled, fearing lest his\r\nproject had been discovered.  “What is the matter, Revol?” said he; “what\r\nis it?  How pale you are!  You will spoil all.  Rub your cheeks; rub your\r\ncheeks.”  “There is nothing wrong, sir: only M. de Nambu would not let\r\nme in without your Majesty’s express command.”  Revol entered the\r\ncouncil-chamber and discharged his commission.  The Duke of Guise pulled\r\nup his cloak as if to wrap himself well in it, took his hat, gloves, and\r\nhis sweetmeat-box, and went out of the room, saying, “Adieu, gentlemen,”\r\n with a gravity free from any appearance of mistrust.  He crossed the\r\nking’s chamber contiguous to the council-hall, courteously saluted, as he\r\npassed, Loignac and his comrades, whom he found drawn up, and who,\r\nreturning him a frigid obeisance, followed him as if to show him respect.\r\nOn arriving at the door of the old cabinet, and just as he leaned down to\r\nraise the tapestry that covered it, Guise was struck five poniard blows\r\nin the chest, neck, and reins.  “God ha’ mercy!” he cried, and, though\r\nhis sword was entangled in his cloak, and he was himself pinned by the\r\narms and legs and choked by the blood that spurted from his throat, he\r\ndragged his murderers, by a supreme effort of energy, to the other end of\r\nthe room, where he fell down backwards and lifeless before the bed of\r\nHenry III., who, coming to the door of his room and asking “if it was\r\ndone,” contemplated with mingled satisfaction and terror the inanimate\r\nbody of his mighty rival, “who seemed to be merely sleeping, so little\r\nwas he changed.”  “My God!  how tall he is!” cried the king; “he looks\r\neven taller than when he was alive.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Henry III.  and the Murder of Guise----437]\r\n\r\n“They are killing my brother!” cried the Cardinal of Guise, when he heard\r\nthe noise that was being made in the next room; and he rose up to run\r\nthither.  The Archbishop of Lyons, Peter d’Espinac, did the same.  The\r\nDuke of Aumont held them both back, saying, “Gentlemen, we must wait for\r\nthe king’s orders.”  Orders came to arrest them both, and confine them in\r\na small room over the council-chamber.  They had “eggs, bread, wine from\r\nthe king’s cellar, their breviaries, their night-gowns, a palliasse, and\r\na mattress,” brought to them there; and they were kept under ocular\r\nsupervision for four and twenty hours.  The Cardinal of Guise was\r\nreleased the next morning, but only to be put to death like his brother.\r\nThe king spared the Archbishop of Lyons.\r\n\r\n“I am sole king,” said Henry III. to his ministers, as he entered the\r\ncouncil-chamber; and shortly afterwards, going to see the queen-mother,\r\nwho was ill of the gout, “How do you feel?” he asked.  “Better,” she\r\nanswered.  “So do I,” replied the king: “I feel much better; this morning\r\nI have become King of France again; the King of Paris is dead.”  “You\r\nhave had the Duke of Guise killed?” asked Catherine “have you reflected\r\nwell?  God grant that you become not king of nothing at all.  I hope the\r\ncutting is right; now for the sewing.”  According to the majority of the\r\nhistorians, Catherine had neither been in the secret nor had anything to\r\ndo with the preparations for the measure.  Granted that she took no\r\nactive part in it, and that she avoided even the appearance of having any\r\nprevious knowledge of it; she was not fond of responsibility, and she\r\nliked better to negotiate between the different parties than to make her\r\ndecisive choice between them; prudent tendencies grow with years, and in\r\n1588 she was sixty-nine.  It is difficult, however, to believe that,\r\nbeing the habitual confidant of her favorite son, she was ignorant of a\r\ndesign long meditated, and known to many persons many days before its\r\nexecution.  The event once accomplished, ill as she was, and contrary to\r\nthe advice of her physicians, she had herself carried to the Cardinal of\r\nBourbon’s, who was still under arrest by the king’s orders, to promise\r\nhim speedy release.  “Ah! madame,” said the cardinal, as he saw her\r\nenter, “these are some of your tricks; you are death to us all.”  However\r\nit may be, thirteen days after the murder of the Duke of Guise, on the\r\n5th of January, 1589, Catherine de’ Medici herself died.  Nor was her\r\ndeath, so far as affairs and the public were concerned, an event: her\r\nability was of the sort which is worn out by the frequent use made\r\nof it, and which, when old age comes on, leaves no long or grateful\r\nreminiscence.  Time has restored Catherine de’ Medici to her proper place\r\nin history; she was quickly forgotten by her contemporaries.\r\n\r\nShe had good reason to say to her son, as her last advice, “Now for the\r\nsewing.”  It was not long before Henry III. perceived that to be king, it\r\nwas not sufficient to have murdered his rival.  He survived the Duke of\r\nGuise only seven months, and during that short period he was not really\r\nking, all by himself, for a single day; never had his kingship been so\r\nembarrassed and impotent; the violent death of the Duke of Guise had\r\nexasperated much more than enfeebled the League; the feeling against his\r\nmurderer was passionate and contagious; the Catholic cause had lost its\r\ngreat leader; it found and accepted another in his brother the Duke of\r\nMayenne, far inferior to his elder brother in political talent and prompt\r\nenergy of character, but a brave and determined soldier, a much better\r\nman of party and action than the sceptical, undecided, and indolent Henry\r\nIII.  The majority of the great towns of France--Paris, Rouen, Orleans,\r\nToulouse, Lyons, Amiens--and whole provinces declared eagerly against the\r\nroyal murderer.  He demanded support from the states-general, who refused\r\nit; and he was obliged to dismiss them.  The Parliament of Paris,\r\ndismembered on the 16th of January, 1589, by the council of Sixteen,\r\nbecame the instrument of the Leaguers.  The majority of the other\r\nParliaments followed the example set by that of Paris.  The Sorbonne,\r\nconsulted by a petition presented in the name of all Catholics, decided\r\nthat Frenchmen were released from their oath of allegiance to Henry III.,\r\nand might with a good conscience turn their arms against him.  Henry made\r\nsome obscure attempts to come to an arrangement with certain chiefs of\r\nthe Leaguers; but they were rejected with violence.  The Duke of Mayenne,\r\nhaving come to Paris on the 15th of February, was solemnly received at\r\nNotre-Dame, amidst shouts of “Hurrah for the Catholic princes! hurrah for\r\nthe house of Lorraine!”  He was declared lieutenant-general of the crown\r\nand state of France.  He organized a council-general of the League,\r\ncomposed of forty members and charged with the duty of providing for all\r\nmatters of war, the finance and the police of the realm, pending a fresh\r\nconvocation of states-general.  To counterbalance in some degree the\r\npopular element, Mayenne introduced into it fourteen personages of his\r\nown choice and a certain number of magistrates and bishops; the delegates\r\nof the united towns were to have seats at the council whenever they\r\nhappened to be at Paris.  “Never,” says M. Henry Martin [_Histoire de\r\nFrance,_ t. i.  p. 134] very truly, “could the League have supposed\r\nitself to be so near becoming a government of confederated municipalities\r\nunder the directorate of Paris.”\r\n\r\nThere was clearly for Henry III. but one possible ally who had a chance\r\nof doing effectual service, and that was Henry of Navarre and the\r\nProtestants.  It cost Henry III. a great deal to have recourse to that\r\nparty; his conscience and his pusillanimity both revolted at it equally;\r\nin spite of his moral corruption, he was a sincere Catholic, and the\r\nprospect of excommunication troubled him deeply.  Catholicism, besides,\r\nwas in a large majority in France: how, then, was he to treat with its\r\nfoes without embroiling himself utterly with it?  Meanwhile the case was\r\nurgent.  Henry was apprised by one of his confidants, Nicholas de\r\nRambouillet, that one of the King of Navarre’s confidants, Sully, who was\r\nthen only Sieur de Rosny, was passing by Blois on his way to his master;\r\nhe saw him and expressed to him his “desire for a reconciliation with the\r\nKing of Navarre, and to employ him on confidential service;” the\r\ndifficulty was to secure to the Protestant king and his army, then\r\nengaged in the siege of Chatellerault, a passage across the Loire.  Rosny\r\nundertook Henry III.’s commission.  He at the same time received another\r\nfrom Sieur de Brigueux, governor of the little town of Beaugency, who\r\nsaid to him, “I see well, sir, that the king is going the right way to\r\nruin himself by timidity, irresolution, and bad advice, and that\r\nnecessity will throw us into the hands of the League: for my part, I will\r\nnever belong to it, and I would rather serve the King of Navarre.  Tell\r\nhim that I hold, at Beaugency, a passage over the Loire, and that if he\r\nwill be pleased to send to me you or M. de Rebours, I will admit into the\r\ntown him whom he sends to me.”  Upon receiving these overtures, the King\r\nof Navarre thought a while, scratching his head; then he said to Rosny,\r\n“Do you think that the king has good intentions towards me, and means to\r\ntreat with me in good faith?”  “Yes, sir, for the present; and you need\r\nhave no doubt about it, for his straits constrain him thereto, having\r\nnothing to look to in his perils but your assistance.”  He had some\r\ndinner brought into his own cabinet for Rosny, and then made him post off\r\nat once.  On arriving in the evening at Tours, whither Henry III. had\r\nfallen back, Rosny was taken to him, about midnight, at the top of the\r\ncastle; the king sent him off that very night; he consented to everything\r\nthat the King of Navarre proposed; promised him a town on the Loire, and\r\nsaid he was ready to make with him not a downright peace just at first,\r\nbut “a good long truce, which, in their two hearts, would at once be an\r\neternal peace and a sincere reconciliation.”\r\n\r\nWhen Rosny got back to Chatellerault, “there was nothing but rejoicing;\r\neverybody ran to meet him; he was called ‘god Rosny,’ and one of his\r\nfriends said to the rest, ‘Do you see yon man?  By God, we shall all\r\nworship him, and he alone will restore France; I said so six years ago,\r\nand Villandry was of my opinion.’”\r\n\r\nThus was the way paved and the beginning made, between the two kings, of\r\nan alliance demanded by their mutual interests, and still more strongly\r\nby the interests of France, ravaged and desolated, for nearly thirty\r\nyears past, by religious civil wars.  Henry of Navarre had profound\r\nsympathy for his country’s sufferings, an ardent desire to put a stop to\r\nthem, and at the same time the instinct to see clearly that the day had\r\ncome when the re-establishment of harmony and common action between\r\nhimself and Henry de Valois was the necessary and at the same time\r\npossible means of attaining that great result.  On the 4th of March,\r\n1589, soon after the states of Blois had been dismissed, he set before\r\nFrance, in an eloquent manifesto, the expression of his anxieties and his\r\ncounsels: “I will speak freely,” said he, “to myself first and then to\r\nothers, that we may be all of us without excuse.  Let us not be puffed up\r\nwith pride on one side or another.  As for me, although I have received\r\nmore favors from God in this than in all past wars, and, whilst the two\r\nother parties (how sad that they must be so called!) are enfeebled, mine,\r\nto all appearance, has been strengthened, nevertheless I well know that,\r\nwhenever I go beyond my duty, God will no longer bless me; and I shall do\r\nso whenever, without reason and in sheer lightness of heart, I attack my\r\nking and trouble the repose of his kingdom.  .  .  .  I declare, then,\r\nfirst of all to those who belong to the party of the king my lord, that\r\nif they do not counsel him to make use of me, and of the means which God\r\nhath given me, for to make war, not on them of Lorraine, not on Paris,\r\nOrleans, or Toulouse, but on those who shall hinder the peace and the\r\nobedience owed to this crown, they alone will be answerable for the woes\r\nwhich will come upon the king and the kingdom.  .  .  .  And as to those\r\nwho still adhere to the name and party of the League, I, as a Frenchman,\r\nconjure them to put up with their losses as I do with mine, and to\r\nsacrifice their quarrels, vengeance, and ambition to the welfare of\r\nFrance, their mother, to the service of their king, to their own repose\r\nand ours.  If they do otherwise, I hope that God will not abandon the\r\nking, and will put it into his heart to call around him his servants,\r\nmyself the first, who wish for no other title, and who shall have\r\nsufficient might and good right to help him wipe out their memory from\r\nthe world and their party from France.  .  .  .  I wish these written\r\nwords to go proclaiming for me throughout the world that I am ready to\r\nask my lord the king for peace, for the repose of his kingdom and for my\r\nown.  .  .  .  And finally, if I find one or another so sleepy-headed or\r\nso ill-disposed that none is moved thereby, I will call God to my aid,\r\nand, true servant of my king, worthy of the honor that belongs to me as\r\npremier prince of this realm, though all the world should have conspired\r\nfor its ruin, I protest, before God and before man, that, at the risk of\r\nten thousand lives, I will essay--all alone--to prevent it.”\r\n\r\nIt is pleasing to think that this patriotic step and these powerful words\r\nwere not without influence over the result which was attained.  The King\r\nof Navarre set to work, at the same time with Rosny, one, of the most\r\neminent, and with Philip du Plessis-Mornay, the most sterling of his\r\nservants; and a month after the publication of his manifesto, on the 3d\r\nof April, 1589, a truce for a year was concluded between the two kings.\r\nIt set forth that the King of Navarre should serve the King of France\r\nwith all his might and main; that he should have, for the movements of\r\nhis troops on both banks of the Loire, the place of Saumur; that the\r\nplaces of which he made himself master should be handed over to Henry\r\nIII., and that he might not anywhere do anything to the prejudice of the\r\nCatholic religion; that the Protestants should be no more disquieted\r\nthroughout the whole of France, and that, before the expiration of the\r\ntruce, King Henry III. should give them assurance of peace.  This\r\nnegotiation was not concluded without difficulty, especially as regarded\r\nthe town of Saumur; there was a general desire to cede to the King of\r\nNavarre only some place of less importance on the Loire; and when, on the\r\n15th of April, Du Plessis-Mornay, who had been appointed governor of it,\r\npresented himself for admittance at the head of his garrison, the\r\nroyalist commandant, who had to deliver the keys to him, limited himself\r\nto letting them drop at his feet.  Mornay showed alacrity in picking them\r\nup.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of April, the two kings had, each on his own behalf, made\r\ntheir treaty public.  Henry III. sent word to the King of Navarre that he\r\nwished to see him and have some conversation with him.  Many of the King\r\nof Navarre’s friends dissuaded him from this interview, saying, “They\r\nare traitors; do not put yourself in their power; remember the\r\nSt. Bartholomew.”  This counsel was repeated to him on the 30th of April,\r\nat the very moment when he was stepping aboard the boat to cross the\r\nLoire and go to pay Henry III. a visit at the castle of Plessis-les-\r\nTours.  The King of Navarre made no account of it.  “God hath bidden me\r\nto cross and see him,” he answered: “it is not in the power of man to\r\nkeep me back, for God is guiding me and crossing with me.  Of that I am\r\ncertain;” and he crossed the river.  “It is incredible,” says L’Estoile,\r\n“what joy everybody felt at this interview; there was such a throng of\r\npeople that, notwithstanding all efforts to preserve order, the two kings\r\nwere a full quarter of an hour in the roadway of Plessis park holding out\r\ntheir hands to one another without being able to join them; people\r\nclimbed trees to see them; all shouted with great vigor and exultation,\r\nHurrah for the king! hurrah for the King of Navarre! hurrah for the\r\nkings!  At last, having joined hands, they embraced very lovingly, even\r\nto tears.  The King of Navarre, on retiring in the evening, said, ‘I\r\nshall now die happy, since God hath given me grace to look upon the face\r\nof my king and make him an offer of my services.’  I know not if those\r\nwere his own words; but what is certain is, that everybody at this time,\r\nboth kings and people, except fanatical Leaguers, regarded peace as a\r\ngreat public blessing, and were rejoiced to have a prospect of it before\r\ntheir eyes.  The very day of the interview, the King of Navarre wrote to\r\nDu Plessis-Mornay, ‘M. du Plessis, the ice is broken; not without numbers\r\nof warnings that if I went I was a dead man.  I crossed the water,\r\ncommending myself to God, who, by His goodness, not only preserved me,\r\nbut caused extreme joy to appear on the king’s countenance, and the\r\npeople to cheer so that never was the like, even shouting, Hurrah for the\r\nkings! whereat I was much vexed.’”\r\n\r\nSome days afterwards, during the night of May 8, the Duke of Mayenne made\r\nan attack upon Tours, and carried for the moment the Faubourg St.\r\nSymphorien, which gave Henry III. such a fright that he was on the point\r\nof leaving the city and betaking himself to a distance.  But the King of\r\nNavarre, warned in time, entered Tours; and at his approach the Leaguers\r\nfell back.  “When the white scarfs appeared, coming to the king’s rescue,\r\nthe Duke of Mayenne and his troops began shouting to them, ‘Back! white\r\nscarfs; back! Chatillon: we are not set against you, but against the\r\nmurderers of your father!’ meaning thereby that they were set against\r\nKing Henry de Valois only, and not against the Huguenots.  But Chatillon,\r\namongst the rest, answered them, ‘You are all of you traitors to your\r\ncountry: I trample under foot all vengeance and all private interests\r\nwhen the service of my prince and of the state is concerned; ‘which he\r\nsaid so loudly that even his Majesty heard it, and praised him for it,\r\nand loved him for it.”  The two kings determined to move on Paris and\r\nbesiege it; and towards the end of July their camp was pitched before the\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nGreat was the excitement throughout Europe as well as France, at the\r\ncourts of Madrid and Rome as well as in the park of Plessis-les-Tours.\r\nA very serious blow for Philip II., and a very bad omen for the future\r\nof his policy, was this alliance between Henry de Valois and Henry of\r\nNavarre, between a great portion of the Catholics of France and the\r\nProtestants.  Philip II. had plumed himself upon being the patron of\r\nabsolute power in religious as well as political matters, and the\r\ndominant power throughout Europe in the name of Catholicism and Spain.\r\nIn both these respects he ran great risk of being beaten by a King of\r\nFrance who was a Protestant or an ally of Protestants and supported by\r\nthe Protestant influence of England, Holland, and Germany.  In Italy\r\nitself and in Catholic Europe Philip did not find the harmony and support\r\nfor which he looked.  The republic of Venice was quietly but certainly\r\nwell disposed towards France, and determined to live on good terms with a\r\nKing of France, a friend of Protestants or even himself Protestant.  And\r\nwhat hurt Philip II. still more was, that Pope Sixtus V. himself, though\r\nall the while upholding the unity and authority of the Roman church,\r\nwas bent upon not submitting to the yoke of Spain, and upon showing a\r\nfavorable disposition towards France.  “France is a very noble kingdom,”\r\n he said to the Venetian ambassador Gritti; “the church has always\r\nobtained great advantages from her.  We love her beyond measure, and we\r\nare pleased to find that the Signiory shares our affection.”  Another day\r\nhe expressed to him his disapprobation of the League.  “We cannot praise,\r\nindeed we must blame, the first act committed by the Duke of Guise, which\r\nwas to take up arms and unite with other princes against the king; though\r\nhe made religion a pretext, he had no right to take up arms against his\r\nsovereign.”  And again: “The union of the King of France with the\r\nheretics is no longer a matter of doubt; but, after all, Henry of Navarre\r\nis worth a great many of Henry III.; this latter will have the measure he\r\nmeted to the Guises.”  So much equity and mental breadth on the pope’s\r\npart was better suited for the republic of Venice than for the King of\r\nSpain.  “We have but one desire,” wrote the Doge Cicogna to Badoero, his\r\nambassador at Rome, “and that is to keep the European peace.  We cannot\r\nbelieve that Sixtus V., that great pontiff, is untrue to his charge,\r\nwhich is to ward off from the Christian world the dangers that threaten\r\nit; in imitation of Him whom he represents on earth, he will show mercy,\r\nand not proceed to acts which would drive the King of France to despair.”\r\n During the great struggle with which Europe was engaged in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, the independence of states, religious tolerance, and political\r\nliberty thus sometimes found, besides their regular and declared\r\nchampions, protectors, useful on occasion although they were timid, even\r\namongst the habitual allies of Charles V.’s despotic and persecuting\r\nsuccessor.\r\n\r\nOn arriving before Paris towards the end of July, 1589, the two kings\r\nbesieged it with an army of forty-two thousand men, the strongest and the\r\nbest they had ever had under their orders.  “The affairs of Henry III.,”\r\n says De Thou, “had changed face; fortune was pronouncing for him.”\r\n Quartered in the house of Count de Retz, at St. Cloud, he could thence\r\nsee quite at his ease his city of Paris.  “Yonder,” said he, “is the\r\nheart of the League; it is there that the blow must be struck.  It was\r\ngreat pity to lay in ruins so beautiful and goodly a city.  Still, I must\r\nsettle accounts with the rebels who are in it, and who ignominiously\r\ndrove me away.”  “On Tuesday, August 1, at eight A.  M., he was told,”\r\n says L’Estoile, “that a monk desired to speak with him, but that his\r\nguards made a difficulty about letting him in.  ‘Let him in,’ said the\r\nking: ‘if he is refused, it will be said that I drive monks away and will\r\nnot see them.’  Incontinently entered the monk, having in his sleeve a\r\nknife unsheathed.  He made a profound reverence to the king, who had just\r\ngot up and had nothing on but a dressing-gown about his shoulders, and\r\npresented to him despatches from Count de Brienne, saying that he had\r\nfurther orders to tell the king privately something of importance.  Then\r\nthe king ordered those who were present to retire, and began reading the\r\nletter which the monk had brought asking for a private audience\r\nafterwards; the monk, seeing the king’s attention taken up with reading,\r\ndrew his knife from his sleeve and drove it right into the king’s small\r\ngut, below the navel, so home that he left the knife in the hole; the\r\nwhich the king having drawn out with great exertion struck the monk a\r\nblow with the point of it on his left eyebrow, crying, ‘Ah! wicked monk!\r\nhe has killed me; kill him!’  At which cry running quickly up, the guards\r\nand others, such as happened to be nearest, massacred this assassin of a\r\nJacobin who, as D’Aubigne says, stretched out his two arms against the\r\nwall, counterfeiting the crucifix, whilst the blows were dealt him.\r\nHaving been dragged out dead from the king’s chamber, he was stripped\r\nnaked to the waist, covered with his gown and exposed to the public.”\r\n\r\nWhilst Henry de Valois was thus struck down at St. Cloud, Henry of\r\nNavarre had moved with a good number of troops to the Pre-aux-Clercs;\r\nand seeing Rosny, who was darting along, pistol in hand, amongst the\r\nforemost, he called one of his gentlemen and said, “Maignan, go and tell\r\nM. de Rosny to come back; he will get taken or wounded in that rash\r\nstyle.”  “I should not care to speak so to him,” answered Maignan.  “I\r\nwill tell him that your Majesty wants him.”  Meanwhile up came a\r\ngentleman at a gallop, who said three or four words in the King of\r\nNavarre’s ear.  “My friend,” said Henry to Rosny, “the king has just been\r\nwounded with a knife in the stomach; let us go and see about it; come\r\nwith me.”  Henry took with him five and twenty gentlemen.  The king\r\nreceived him affectionately, exhorted him to change his religion for his\r\nsalvation’s sake in another world and his fortunes in this; and,\r\naddressing the people of quality who thronged his chamber, he said, “I do\r\npray you as my friends, and as your king I order you, to recognize after\r\nmy death my brother here.  For my satisfaction and as your bounden duty,\r\nI pray you to swear it to him in my presence.”  All present took the\r\noath.  Henry III. spoke in a firm voice; and his wound was not believed\r\nto be mortal.  Letters were sent in his name to the queen, to the\r\ngovernors of the provinces and to the princes allied to the crown, to\r\ninform them of the accident that had happened to the king, “which, please\r\nGod, will turn out to be nothing.”  The King of Navarre asked for some\r\ndetails as to the assassin.  James Clement was a young Dominican who,\r\naccording to report, had been a soldier before he became a monk.  He was\r\nalways talking of waging war against Henry de Valois, and he was called\r\n“Captain Clement.”  He told a story about a vision he had of an angel,\r\nwho had bidden him “to put to death the tyrant of France, in return for\r\nwhich he would have the crown of martyrdom.”  Royalist writers report\r\nthat he had been placed in personal communication with the friends of\r\nHenry de Guise, even with his sister the Duchess of Montpensier, and his\r\nbrother the Duke of Mayenne.  When well informed of the facts, the King\r\nof Navarre returned to his quarters at Meudon, and Rosny to his lodging\r\nat the foot of the castle.  Whilst Rosny was at supper, his secretary\r\ncame and said to him, “Sir, the King of Navarre, peradventure the King of\r\nFrance, wants you.  M. d’Orthoman writes to him to make haste and come to\r\nSt. Cloud if he would see the king alive.”  The King of Navarre at once\r\ndeparted.  Just as he arrived at St. Cloud, he heard in the street cries\r\nof “Ah! my God, we are lost!”  He was told that the king was dead.  Henry\r\nIII., in fact, expired on the 2d of August, 1589, between two and three\r\nin the morning.  The first persons Henry of Navarre encountered as he\r\nentered the Hotel de Retz were the officers of the Scottish guard, who\r\nthrew themselves at his feet, saying, “Ah! sir, you are now our king and\r\nour master.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Henry of Navarre and the Scotch Guard----448]\r\n\r\nEND OF VOLUME IV.",
