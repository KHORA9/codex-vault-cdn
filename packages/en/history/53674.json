Orientalists are greatly indebted to the Sayyid for\r\nhis disinterested labours, but his text seems to have been made from\r\na single and defective MS. and is often incorrect, especially in the\r\ncase of proper names. I have collated it with the excellent MSS. in the\r\nIndia Office and the British Museum, and have thus been able to make\r\nnumerous corrections. I have also consulted the MS. in the Library\r\nof the R.A.S., but it is not a good one. I have, with Mr. Rogers's\r\npermission, revised the translation, and I have added many notes.\r\n\r\nThere is an account of the Memoirs in the sixth volume of Elliot &\r\nDowson's \"History of India,\" and there the subject of the various\r\nrecensions is discussed. There is also a valuable note by Dr. Rieu\r\nin his \"Catalogue of Persian MSS.,\" i, 253. It is there pointed out\r\nthat there is a manuscript translation of the first nine years of the\r\nMemoirs by William Erskine in the British Museum. I have consulted this\r\ntranslation and found it helpful. The MS. is numbered Add. 26,611. The\r\ntranslation is, of course, excellent, and it was made from a good MS.\r\n\r\nA translation of what Dr. Rieu calls the garbled Memoirs of Jahangir\r\nwas made by Major David Price and published by the Oriental Translation\r\nCommittee of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1829. The author of this\r\nwork is unknown, and its history is an unsolved problem. It is\r\noccasionally fuller than the genuine Memoirs, and it contains some\r\npicturesque touches, such as the account of Akbar's deathbed. But it\r\nis certain that it is, in part at least, a fabrication, and that it\r\ncontains statements which Jahangir could never have made. Compare, for\r\ninstance, the account of the death of Sohrab, the son of Mirza Rustam,\r\nnear the end of Price's translation, pp. 138-9, with that given in the\r\ngenuine Memoirs in the narrative of the fifteenth year of the reign,\r\np. 293, and also in the Iqbal-nama, p. 139. Besides being inaccurate,\r\nthe garbled or spurious Memoirs are much shorter than the genuine\r\nwork, and do not go beyond the fifteenth year. Price's translation,\r\ntoo, was made from a single and badly written MS. [1] which is now in\r\nthe R.A.S. library. Dr. Rieu remarks that it is to be regretted that\r\nso poor a fabrication as the garbled Memoirs should have been given\r\nto the world as a genuine production of Jahangir. This being so, it\r\nis appropriate that the present translation of the genuine Memoirs\r\nshould be published by the Royal Asiatic Society.\r\n\r\nWhen Jahangir had written his Memoirs for the first twelve years\r\nof his reign he made them into a volume, and had a number of copies\r\nmade and distributed (Elliot, vi, 360). The first of these he gave to\r\nShah Jahan, who was then in high favour. The present publication is a\r\ntranslation of the first volume of the Memoirs, but the translation\r\nof the whole Memoirs, together with the additions of Mu`tamad Khan\r\nand Muhammad Hadi, has been completed, and it is to be hoped that\r\nits publication will follow in due course.\r\n\r\nJahangir reigned for twenty-two years, but ill-health and sorrow\r\nmade him give up the writing of his Memoirs in the seventeenth\r\nyear of his reign (see Elliot, vi, 280). He then entrusted the task\r\nto Mu`tamad Khan, the author of the Iqbal-nama, who continued the\r\nMemoirs to the beginning of the nineteenth year. He then dropped\r\nwriting the Memoirs in the name of the emperor, but he continued\r\nthe narrative of the reign, to Jahangir's death, in his own work,\r\nthe Iqbal-nama. Muhammad Hadi afterwards continued the Memoirs down\r\nto Jahangir's death, but his work is little more than an abridgment\r\nof the Iqbal-nama. Sayyid Ahmad's edition contains the continuations\r\nof the Memoirs by Mu`tamad and Muhammad Hadi, and also Muhammad\r\nHadi's preface and introduction. But this preface and introduction\r\nhave not been translated by Mr. Rogers, and I do not think that a\r\ntranslation is necessary. Muhammad Hadi is a late writer (see Elliot,\r\nvi, 392), his date being the first quarter of the eighteenth century,\r\nand his introduction seems to be almost wholly derived from the\r\nMa'asir-i-Jahangiri of Kamgar Husaini (Elliot, vi, 257). It consists\r\nmainly of an account of Jahangir's life from his birth up to his\r\naccession.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps unnecessary to say anything about the importance of\r\nJahangir's Memoirs. They give a lively picture of India in the early\r\ndecades of the seventeenth century, and are a valuable supplement to\r\nthe Akbar-nama. I may be allowed, however, to end this preface with\r\nthe following remarks which I contributed to the Indian Magazine for\r\nMay, 1907:--\r\n\r\n\"The Royal authors of the East had more blood in them than those kings\r\nwhose works have been catalogued by Horace Walpole. To find a parallel\r\nto them we must go back to Julius Cæsar, and even then the advantage\r\nis not upon the side of Europe. After all, the commentaries of the\r\nfamous Roman are a little disappointing, and certainly the Memoirs of\r\nBabar and Jahangir are far more human and fuller of matter than the\r\nstory of the Gallic Wars. All Muhammadans have a fancy for writing\r\nchronicles and autobiographies, and several Muhammadan kings have\r\nyielded to the common impulse. Central Asia has given us the Memoirs\r\nof Tamarlane, Babar, and Haidar, and the chronicle of Abu-l-ghazi;\r\nPersia has given us the Memoirs of Shah Tahmasp, and India the Memoirs\r\nof the Princess Gulbadan and Jahangir. In modern times we see the\r\nsame impulse at work, for we have the biography of the late Ameer of\r\nAfghanistan and the diary of the Shah of Persia.\r\n\r\n\"The contributions to literature by Royal authors which come to\r\nus from the East form a department by themselves, and one which\r\nis of great value. Nearly all Eastern histories are disfigured\r\nby adulation. Even when the author has had no special reason for\r\nflattery and for suppression of truth, he has been dazzled by the\r\ngreatness of his subject, and gives us a picture which no more\r\nreveals the real king than does a telescope the real constitution\r\nof the Morning Star. But when Eastern monarchs give us chronicles,\r\nthe case is different. They have no occasion for fear or favour,\r\nand mercilessly expose the failings of their contemporaries. Not that\r\nthey are to be trusted any more than other Orientals when speaking of\r\nthemselves. Babar has suppressed the story of his vassalage to Shah\r\nIsma`il, of his defeat at Ghajdawan, and his treatment of `Alam Lodi;\r\nand Jahangir has glossed over his rebellion against his father, and\r\nthe circumstances of Shir-afgan's death. But when they have to speak\r\nof others--whether kings or nobles--they give us the whole truth, and\r\nperhaps a little more. An amiable Princess like Gulbadan Begam may\r\nveil the faults and weaknesses of her brothers Humayun and Hindal;\r\nbut Babar strips the gilt off nearly every one whom he mentions,\r\nand spares no one--not even his own father.\r\n\r\n\"The Memoirs of Babar, Haidar, and Gulbadan have been translated\r\ninto English, and those of Tahmasp have been translated into German;\r\nbut unfortunately Jahangir's have never been fully translated, [2]\r\nthough there are extracts in Elliot & Dowson's History, and Major\r\nPrice many years ago gave us from an imperfect manuscript a garbled\r\naccount of a few years of his Memoirs. Yet in reality Jahangir's\r\nMemoirs are not inferior in interest to those of Babar. Indeed, we\r\nmay go further and say there is twice as much matter in them as in\r\nBabar's Memoirs, and that they are by far the most entertaining of\r\nthe two works. Not that Jahangir was by any means as remarkable a man\r\nas his great-grandfather. He was a most faulty human being, and his\r\nown account of himself often excites our disgust and contempt. But he\r\nhad the sense not to confine his narrative to an account of himself,\r\nand he has given us a picture of his father, the great Akbar,\r\nwhich is a bigger 'plum' than anything in Babar's Memoirs. But his\r\naccount of himself has also its charm, for it reveals the real man,\r\nand so he lives for us in his Memoirs just as James VI--to whom,\r\nand to the Emperor Claudius, he bears a strange and even ludicrous\r\nresemblance--lives in the 'Fortunes of Nigel' or Claudius in Suetonius\r\nand Tacitus. Jahangir was indeed a strange mixture. The man who could\r\nstand by and see men flayed alive, and who, as he himself tells us,\r\nput one man to death and had two others hamstrung because they showed\r\nthemselves inopportunely and frightened away his game, could yet be a\r\nlover of justice and could spend his Thursday evenings in holding high\r\nconverse. He could quote Firdusi's verse against cruelty to animals--\r\n\r\n\r\n           'Ah! spare yon emmet, rich in hoarded grain--\r\n            He lives with pleasure, and he dies with pain';\r\n\r\n\r\nand be soft-hearted enough to wish that his father were alive to\r\nshare with him the delicious mangoes of India. He could procure the\r\nmurder of Abu-l-fazl and avow the fact without remorse, and also\r\npity the royal elephants because they shivered in winter when they\r\nsprinkled themselves with cold water. 'I observed this,' he says,\r\n'and so I ordered that the water should be heated to the temperature\r\nof luke-warm milk.' And he adds: 'This was entirely my own idea;\r\nnobody had ever thought of it before.' One good trait in Jahangir\r\nwas his hearty enjoyment of Nature and his love for flowers. Babar\r\nhad this also, but he was old, or at least worn out, when he came to\r\nIndia, and he was disgusted by an Indian attempt to poison him, and\r\nso his description of India is meagre and splenetic. Jahangir, on the\r\nother hand, is a true Indian, and dwells delightedly on the charms of\r\nIndian flowers, particularises the palas, the bokul, and the champa,\r\nand avows that no fruit of Afghanistan or Central Asia is equal to the\r\nmango. He loved, too, to converse with pandits and Hindu ascetics,\r\nthough he is contemptuous of their avatars, and causes the image of\r\nVishnu as the boar avatar to be broken and flung into the Pushkar lake.\r\n\r\n\"It is a remark of Hallam's that the best attribute of Muhammadan\r\nprinces is a rigorous justice in chastising the offences of others. Of\r\nthis quality Jahangir, in spite of all his weaknesses, had a large\r\nshare, and even to this day he is spoken of with respect by Muhammadans\r\non account of his love of justice. It is a pathetic circumstance that\r\nit was this princely quality which was to some extent the cause of the\r\ngreat affront put upon him by Mahabat Khan. Many complaints had been\r\nmade to Jahangir of the oppressions of Mahabat in Bengal, and crowds\r\nof suppliants had come to Jahangir's camp. It was his desire to give\r\nthem redress and to punish Mahabat for his exactions, together with\r\nhis physical and mental weakness, which led to his capture on the\r\nbanks of the Jhilam.\r\n\r\n\"One of the many interesting observations in his Memoirs is his account\r\nof an inscription he saw at Hindaun. He says that in the thirteenth\r\nyear of his reign, as he was marching back to Agra, he found a verse\r\nby someone inscribed on the pillar of a pleasure-house on an islet\r\nin the lake at Hindaun. He then proceeds to quote it, and it turns\r\nout to be one of Omar Khayyam's! This is FitzGerald's paraphrase:--\r\n\r\n\r\n           'For some we loved, the loveliest and the best\r\n              That from his vintage Time hath prest,\r\n            Have drunk their Cup a Round or two before,\r\n              And one by one crept silently to rest.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The same quatrain has also been quoted by Badayuni in his history,\r\nand the interesting thing about Jahangir's quotation of it is that\r\nhe could see the beauty of the verse and at the same time did not\r\nknow who was the author. There is also an interest in the fact\r\nthat the third line contains a different reading from that given in\r\nWhinfield's edition of the text. Hindaun is in the Jaipur territory,\r\nand one would like to know if the inscription still exists.\r\n\r\n\"Among other things in Jahangir's Memoirs there is the description\r\nof the outbreak of the Plague, given to him by a lady of his court\r\n[which has been quoted by Dr. Simpson in his book upon Plague], and\r\nthere is a very full account of Kashmir, which is considerably superior\r\nto that in the Ayin Akbari, which Sir Walter Lawrence has praised.\"\r\n\r\nWith reference to the portrait of Jahangir prefixed to this volume,\r\nit may be interesting to note that it appears from Mr. E. B. Havell's\r\n\"Indian Sculpture,\" p. 203, that the British Museum possesses a\r\ndrawing by Rembrandt which was copied from a Moghul miniature,\r\nand which has been pronounced by Mr. Rouffaer to be a portrait\r\nof Jahangir. Coryat (Purchas, reprint, iv, 473) thus describes\r\nJahangir's personal appearance:--\"He is fifty and three years of\r\nage, his nativity-day having been celebrated with wonderful pomp\r\nsince my arrival here. On that day he weighed himself in a pair of\r\ngolden scales, which by great chance I saw the same day; a custom he\r\nobserves most inviolably every year. He is of complexion neither white\r\nnor black, but of a middle betwixt them. I know not how to express\r\nit with a more expressive and significant epitheton than olive. An\r\nolive colour his face presenteth. He is of a seemly composition of\r\nbody, of a stature little unequal (as I guess not without grounds of\r\nprobability) to mine, but much more corpulent than myself.\"\r\n\r\nAs regards the bibliography of the Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri, I have to\r\nnote that there is an Urdu translation by Munshi Ahmad `Ali Simab of\r\nRampura, that is, Aligarh in Tonk. It was made from Muhammad Hadi's\r\nedition under the patronage of Muhammad Ibrahim `Ali Khan Nawab of\r\nTonk, and was published by Newal Kishor in 1291 (1874). There is also\r\na Hindi translation by Munshi Debi Prasad which was published in 1905\r\nat Calcutta by the Bharat Mitra Press. The Urdu translation referred\r\nto by Mr. Blumhardt in his Catalogue of Hindustani MSS., p. 61, and\r\nnoticed by Elliot, vi, 401, and Garcin de Tassy, iii, 301, is, as the\r\ntwo latter writers have remarked, a translation of the Iqbal-nama. The\r\nMS. referred to by Elliot vi, 277, as having been in the possession\r\nof General Thomas Paterson Smith, and which is described in Ethé's\r\nCatalogue of the India Office MSS., No. 2833, p. 1533, was made by\r\nSayyid Muhammad, the elder brother of Sayyid Ahmad. At the end of the\r\nMS. the copyist gives some account of himself and of his family. He\r\nmade the copy from copies in the Royal Library and in the possession\r\nof Rajah Roghu Nath Singh alias Lal Singh Jalpur. He finished it in\r\nOctober, 1843. Sayyid Muhammad was Munsif of Hutgam in the Fathpur\r\ndistrict. He died young in 1845. My friend Mr. T. W. Arnold, of the\r\nIndia Office, informs me that Sayyid Ahmad told him that he found\r\na valuable illustrated MS of the Tuzuk in the débris of the Delhi\r\nRoyal Library, and took it home, but that it was lost when his house\r\nwas plundered by the mutineers. There is in the Bodleian a copy in\r\nSayyid Ahmad's own handwriting. He states that he made use of ten\r\ngood MSS. The Englishman at whose request he made the copy was John\r\nPanton Gubbins, who was once Sessions Judge of Delhi. This copy is\r\ndescribed in the Bodleian Catalogue, p. 117, No. 221. The MS. No. 220\r\ndescribed on the same page was brought home by Fraser, and is a good\r\none, but only goes down to the end of the 14th year.\r\n\r\n\r\nH. Beveridge.\r\n\r\nMarch, 1909.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPostscript.--Since writing this Preface I have been enabled by the\r\nkindness of Mr. Irvine to examine the Hindi Jahangir-nama of Debi\r\nPrasad. It is not a translation, but an abstract, and I do not think\r\nit is of much value. Being a Jodhpur man he has been able, perhaps,\r\nto correct some spellings of places, but he does not seem to have\r\nconsulted any MSS., and when he comes to a difficulty he shirks\r\nit. The most valuable adjunct to the Tuzuk, after the Iqbal-nama,\r\nis the Ma'asir-i-Jahangiri of Kamgar Husaini. It is important as\r\ngiving the early history of Jahangir, that is, of the time when he\r\nwas Prince Selim. There are three copies of his work in the British\r\nMuseum, but the so-called Maathir-i-Jahangiri of the India Office\r\nLibrary, No. 3098, or 324 of the new Catalogue, is only a copy of\r\nthe Iqbal-nama.\r\n\r\nI regret that the number of Errata and Addenda is so large, but when\r\nI began the revision I did not know that Sayyid Ahmad's text was so\r\nincorrect. It will be seen that at pp. 158 and 162 I have made two\r\nerroneous notes.\r\n\r\n\r\nH.

[3]\r\n\r\nTill he was 28 years old, no child of my father had lived, and\r\nhe was continually praying for the survival of a son to dervishes\r\nand recluses, by whom spiritual approach to the throne of Allah is\r\nobtained. As the great master, Khwaja Mu`inu-d-din Chishti, was the\r\nfountain-head of most of the saints of India, he considered that in\r\norder to obtain this object he should have recourse to his blessed\r\nthreshold, and resolved within himself that if Almighty God should\r\nbestow a son on him he would, by way of complete humility, go on\r\nfoot from Agra to his blessed mausoleum, a distance of 140 kos. In\r\nA.H. 977, on Wednesday, 17th Rabi`u-l-awwal (August 31st, 1569), when\r\nseven ghari of the aforesaid day had passed, when Libra (Mizan) had\r\nrisen to the 24th degree, God Almighty brought me into existence from\r\nthe hiding-place of nothingness. At the time when my venerated father\r\nwas on the outlook for a son, a dervish of the name of Shaikh Salim,\r\na man of ecstatic condition, who had traversed many of the stages of\r\nlife, had his abode on a hill near Sikri, one of the villages of Agra,\r\nand the people of that neighbourhood had complete trust in him. As my\r\nfather was very submissive to dervishes, he also visited him. One day,\r\nwhen waiting on him and in a state of distraction, he asked him how\r\nmany sons he should have. The Shaikh replied, \"The Giver who gives\r\nwithout being asked will bestow three sons on you.\" My father said,\r\n\"I have made a vow that, casting my first son on the skirt of your\r\nfavour, I will make your friendship and kindness his protector and\r\npreserver.\" The Shaikh accepted this idea, and said, \"I congratulate\r\nyou, and I will give him my own name.\" When my mother came near the\r\ntime of her delivery, he (Akbar) sent her to the Shaikh's house\r\nthat I might be born there. After my birth they gave me the name\r\nof Sultan Salim, but I never heard my father, whether in his cups\r\nor in his sober moments, call me Muhammad Salim or Sultan Salim,\r\nbut always Shaikhu Baba. My revered father, considering the village\r\nof Sikri, which was the place of my birth, lucky for him, made it\r\nhis capital. In the course of fourteen or fifteen years that hill,\r\nfull of wild beasts, became a city containing all kinds of gardens and\r\nbuildings, and lofty, elegant edifices and pleasant places, attractive\r\nto the heart. After the conquest of Gujarat this village was named\r\nFathpur. When I became king it occurred to me to change my name,\r\nbecause this resembled that of the Emperor of Rum. An inspiration\r\nfrom the hidden world brought it into my mind that, inasmuch as\r\nthe business of kings is the controlling of the world, I should give\r\nmyself the name of Jahangir (World-seizer) and make my title of honour\r\n(laqab) Nuru-d-din, inasmuch as my sitting on the throne coincided with\r\nthe rising and shining on the earth of the great light (the Sun). I\r\nhad also heard, in the days when I was a prince, from Indian sages,\r\nthat after the expiration of the reign and life of King Jalalu-d-din\r\nAkbar one named Nuru-d-din would be administrator of the affairs\r\nof the State. Therefore I gave myself the name and appellation of\r\nNuru-d-din Jahangir Padshah. As this great event took place in Agra,\r\nit is necessary that some account of that city should be given.\r\n\r\nAgra is one of the grand old cities of Hindustan. It had formerly\r\nan old fort on the bank of the Jumna, but this my father threw down\r\nbefore my birth, and he founded a fort of cut red stone, the like of\r\nwhich those who have travelled over the world cannot point out. It\r\nwas completed in the space of fifteen or sixteen years. It had four\r\ngates and two sally-ports, and its cost was 35 lakhs of rupees, equal\r\nto 115,000 toman of current Persian coinage and to 10,500,000 khani\r\naccording to the Turan reckoning. The habitable part of the city\r\nextends on both sides of the river. On its west side, which has the\r\ngreater population, its circumference is seven kos and its breadth is\r\none kos. The circumference of the inhabited part on the other side of\r\nthe water, the side towards the east, is 2 1/2 kos, its length being\r\none kos and its breadth half a kos. But in the number of its buildings\r\nit is equal to several cities of `Iraq, Khurasan, and Mawara'a-n-nahr\r\n(Transoxiana) put together. Many persons have erected buildings\r\nof three or four storeys in it. The mass of people is so great,\r\nthat moving about in the lanes and bazars is difficult. It is on the\r\nboundary of the second climate. On its east is the province of Qanauj;\r\non the west, Nagor; on the north, Sambhal; and on the south, Chanderi.\r\n\r\nIt is written in the books of the Hindus that the source of the Jumna\r\nis in a hill of the name of Kalind, [4] which men cannot reach because\r\nof the excessive cold. The apparent source is a hill near the pargana\r\nof Khizrabad.\r\n\r\nThe air of Agra is warm and dry; physicians say that it depresses\r\nthe spirits (ruhra ba tahlil mibarad) and induces weakness. It is\r\nunsuited to most temperaments, except to the phlegmatic and melancholy,\r\nwhich are safe from its bad effects. For this reason animals of this\r\nconstitution and temperament, such as the elephant, the buffalo,\r\nand others, thrive in its climate.\r\n\r\nBefore the rule of the Lodi Afghans, Agra was a great and populous\r\nplace, and had a castle described by Mas`ud b. Sa`d b. Salman in\r\nthe ode (qasida) which he wrote in praise of Mahmud, son of Sultan\r\nIbrahim, son of Mas`ud, son of Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, on the capture\r\nof the castle--\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"The fort of Agra appeared in the midst of the dust\r\n        Like a mountain, and its battlements like peaks.\" [5]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Sikandar Lodi designed to take Gwalior he came to Agra from\r\nDelhi, which was the capital of the Sultans of India, and settled down\r\nthere. From that date the population and prosperity of Agra increased,\r\nand it became the capital of the Sultans of Delhi. When God Almighty\r\nbestowed the rule of India on this illustrious family, the late king,\r\nBabar, after the defeat of Ibrahim, the son of Sikandar Lodi, and\r\nhis being killed, and after his victory over Rana Sanga, who was the\r\nchief of the Rajas of Hindustan, established on the east side of the\r\nJumna, on improved land, a garden (charbagh) which few places equal\r\nin beauty. He gave it the name of Gul-afshan (Flower-scatterer), and\r\nerected in it a small building of cut red stone, and having completed\r\na mosque on one side of it he intended to make a lofty building,\r\nbut time failed him and his design was never carried into execution.\r\n\r\nIn these Memoirs, whenever Sahib qirani is written it refers to\r\nAmir Timur Gurgan; and whenever Firdus-makani is mentioned, to Babar\r\nPadshah; when Jannat-ashyani is used, to Humayun Padshah; and when\r\n`Arsh-ashyani is employed, to my revered father, Jalalu-d-din Muhammad\r\nAkbar Padshah Ghazi.\r\n\r\nMelons, mangoes, and other fruits grow well in Agra and its\r\nneighbourhood. Of all fruits I am very fond of mangoes. In the reign of\r\nmy father (`Arsh-ashyani) many fruits of other countries, which till\r\nthen were not to be had in India, were obtained there. Several sorts\r\nof grapes, such as the sahibi and the habshi [6] and the kishmishi,\r\nbecame common in several towns; for instance, in the bazars of Lahore\r\nevery kind and variety that may be desired can be had in the grape\r\nseason. Among fruits, one which they call ananas (pineapple), which\r\nis grown in the Frank ports, [7] is of excessive fragrance and fine\r\nflavour. Many thousands are produced every year now in the Gul-afshan\r\ngarden at Agra.\r\n\r\nFrom the excellencies of its sweet-scented flowers one may prefer the\r\nfragrances of India to those of the flowers of the whole world. It\r\nhas many such that nothing in the whole world can be compared to\r\nthem. The first is the champa (Michelia champaca), which is a flower of\r\nexceedingly sweet fragrance; it has the shape of the saffron-flower,\r\nbut is yellow inclining to white. The tree is very symmetrical and\r\nlarge, full of branches and leaves, and is shady. When in flower one\r\ntree will perfume a garden. Surpassing this is the keora [8] flower\r\n(Pandanus odoratissimus). Its shape and appearance are singular, and\r\nits scent is so strong and penetrating that it does not yield to the\r\nodour of musk. Another is the rae bel, [9] which in scent resembles\r\nwhite jessamine. Its flowers are double and treble (?). Another is\r\nthe mulsari [10] (Mimusops Elengi). This tree, too, is very graceful\r\nand symmetrical, and is shady. The scent of its flowers is very\r\npleasant. Another is the ketaki [11] (Pandanus ?), which is of the\r\nnature of the keora, but the latter is thorny, whereas the ketki\r\nhas no thorns. Moreover, the ketki is yellowish, whereas the keora\r\nis white. From these two flowers and also from the chambeli [12]\r\n(Jasminum grandiflorum), which is the white jessamine of wilayat\r\n(Persia or Afghanistan), they extract sweet-scented oils. There are\r\nother flowers too numerous to mention. Of trees there are the cypress\r\n(sarw), the pine (sanubar), the chanar (Platanus orientalis), the\r\nwhite poplar (safidar, Populus alba), and the bid mulla (willow),\r\nwhich they had formerly never thought of in Hindustan, but are now\r\nplentiful. The sandal-tree, which once was peculiar to the islands\r\n(i.e., Java, Sumatra, etc.), also flourishes in the gardens.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Agra exert themselves greatly in the acquirement\r\nof crafts and the search after learning. Various professors of every\r\nreligion and creed have taken up their abode in the city.\r\n\r\nAfter my accession, the first order that I gave was for the\r\nfastening up of the Chain of Justice, so that if those engaged in the\r\nadministration of justice should delay or practise hypocrisy in the\r\nmatter of those seeking justice, the oppressed might come to this\r\nchain and shake it so that its noise might attract attention. Its\r\nfashion was this: I ordered them to make a chain of pure gold, [13]\r\n30 gaz in length and containing 60 bells. Its weight was 4 Indian\r\nmaunds, equal to 42 `Iraqi maunds. One end of it they made fast to the\r\nbattlements of the Shah Burj of the fort at Agra and the other to a\r\nstone post fixed on the bank of the river. I also gave twelve orders to\r\nbe observed as rules of conduct (dasturu-l-`amal) in all my dominions--\r\n\r\n(1) Forbidding the levy of cesses under the names of tamgha and mir\r\nbahri (river tolls), and other burdens which the jagirdars of every\r\nprovince and district had imposed for their own profit.\r\n\r\n(2) On roads where thefts and robberies took place, which roads\r\nmight be at a little distance from habitations, the jagirdars of the\r\nneighbourhood should build sara'is (public rest-houses), mosques,\r\nand dig wells, which might stimulate population, and people might\r\nsettle down in those sara'is. If these should be near a khalisa estate\r\n(under direct State management), the administrator (mutasaddi) of\r\nthat place should execute the work.\r\n\r\n[14](3) The bales of merchants should not be opened on the roads\r\nwithout informing them and obtaining their leave.\r\n\r\n(4) In my dominions if anyone, whether unbeliever or Musalman,\r\nshould die, his property and effects should be left for his heirs,\r\nand no one should interfere with them. If he should have no heir,\r\nthey should appoint inspectors and separate guardians to guard the\r\nproperty, so that its value might be expended in lawful expenditure,\r\nsuch as the building of mosques and sara'is, the repair of broken\r\nbridges, and the digging of tanks and wells.\r\n\r\n(5) They should not make wine or rice-spirit (darbahra) [15] or any\r\nkind of intoxicating drug, or sell them; although I myself drink wine,\r\nand from the age of 18 years up till now, when I am 38, have persisted\r\nin it. When I first took a liking to drinking I sometimes took as much\r\nas twenty cups of double-distilled spirit; when by degrees it acquired\r\na great influence over me I endeavoured to lessen the quantity, and in\r\nthe period of seven years I have brought myself from fifteen cups to\r\nfive or six. My times for drinking were varied; sometimes when three\r\nor four sidereal hours of the day remained I would begin to drink,\r\nand sometimes at night and partly by day. This went on till I was\r\n30 years old. After that I took to drinking always at night. Now I\r\ndrink only to digest my food.\r\n\r\n[16](6) They should not take possession of any person's house.\r\n\r\n(7) I forbade the cutting off the nose or ears of any person, and\r\nI myself made a vow by the throne of God that I would not blemish\r\nanyone by this punishment.\r\n\r\n(8) I gave an order that the officials of the Crown lands and the\r\njagirdars should not forcibly take the ryots' lands and cultivate\r\nthem on their own account.\r\n\r\n(9) A government collector or a jagirdar should not without permission\r\nintermarry with the people of the pargana in which he might be.\r\n\r\n(10) They should found hospitals in the great cities, and appoint\r\nphysicians for the healing of the sick; whatever the expenditure\r\nmight be, should be given from the khalisa establishment.\r\n\r\n(11) In accordance with the regulations of my revered father, I\r\nordered that each year from the 18th [17] of Rabi`u-l-awwal, which\r\nis my birthday, for a number of days corresponding to the years of\r\nmy life, they should not slaughter animals (for food). Two days in\r\neach week were also forbidden, one of them Thursday, the day of my\r\naccession, and the other Sunday, the day of my father's birth. He\r\nheld this day in great esteem on this account, and because it was\r\ndedicated to the Sun, and also because it was the day on which the\r\nCreation began. Therefore it was one of the days on which there was\r\nno killing in his dominions. [18]\r\n\r\n(12) I gave a general order that the offices and jagirs of my father's\r\nservants should remain as they were. Later, the mansabs (ranks or\r\noffices) were increased according to each one's circumstances by not\r\nless than 20 per cent. to 300 or 400 per cent. The subsistence money\r\nof the ahadis was increased by 50 per cent., and I raised the pay of\r\nall domestics by 20 per cent. I increased the allowances of all the\r\nveiled ladies of my father's harem from 20 per cent. to 100 per cent.,\r\naccording to their condition and relationship. By one stroke of the\r\npen I confirmed the subsistence lands [19] of the holders of aimas\r\n(charity lands) within the dominions, who form the army of prayer,\r\naccording to the deeds in their possession. I gave an order to Miran\r\nSadr Jahan, who is one of the genuine Sayyids of India, and who for\r\na long time held the high office of sadr (ecclesiastical officer)\r\nunder my father, that he should every day produce before me deserving\r\npeople (worthy of charity).  [20]I released all criminals who had been\r\nconfined and imprisoned for a long time in the forts and prisons. [21]\r\n\r\nAt a propitious hour I ordered that they should coin gold and silver\r\nof different weights. To each coin I gave a separate name, viz.,\r\nto the muhr of 100 tola, that of nur-shahi; to that of 50 tola,\r\nthat of nur-sultani; to that of 20 tola, nur-daulat; to that of\r\n10 tola, nur-karam; to that of 5 tola, nur-mihr; and to that of 1\r\ntola, nur-jahani. The half of this I called nurani, and the quarter,\r\nrawaji. With regard to the silver coins (sikkas). I gave to the coin\r\nof 100 tola the name of kaukab-i-tali` (star of horoscope); to that\r\nof 50 tola, the name of kaukab-i-iqbal (star of fortune); to that of\r\n20 tola, the name of kaukab-i-murad (star of desire); to that of 10\r\ntola, the name of kaukab-i-bakht (star of good luck); to that of 5\r\ntola, the name of kaukab-i-sa`d (star of auspiciousness); to that of\r\n1 tola, the name of jahangiri. The half jahangiri I called sultani;\r\nthe quarter, nisari [22] (showering money); the dime, khair-i-qabul\r\n(the acceptable). Copper, also, I coined in the same proportions,\r\nand gave each division a particular name. I ordered that on the gold\r\nmuhr of 100, 50, 20, and 10 tola the following verse by Asaf Khan\r\n[23] should be impressed--namely, on the obverse was this couplet:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Fate's pen wrote on the coin in letters of light,\r\n    The Shah Nuru-d-din Jahangir\";\r\n\r\n\r\nand between the lines of the verse the Creed (Kalima) was impressed. On\r\nthe reverse was this couplet, in which the date of coinage was\r\nsignified:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Through this coin is the world brightened as by the sun,\r\n    And the date thereof is 'Sun of Dominion' (Aftab-i-Mamlakat).\" [24]\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween the lines of the verse, the mint, the Hijra year, and the\r\nregnal year were impressed. On the nur-jahani, which is in the place\r\nof the ordinary gold muhr and exceeds it in weight by 20 per cent. (as\r\n12 to 10), is impressed this couplet of the Amiru-l-umara:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Shah Nuru-d-din Jahangir ibn Akbar Padshah\r\n    Made gold's face bright with the sheen of sun and moon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, a hemistich was impressed on each face, and also the mint,\r\nand the Hijra and regnal year. The jahangiri sikka, also, which is\r\ngreater in weight by 20 per cent., was reckoned as equal to a rupee,\r\nits weight being fixed in the same manner as that of the nur-jahani\r\n(each was a tola in weight, but one was in gold and the other was\r\nin silver). The weight of a tola is 2 1/2 misqals of Persia and\r\nTuran. [25]\r\n\r\nIt would not be good to give all the versified chronograms which were\r\nmade for my accession. I therefore content myself with the one which\r\nMaktub Khan, the superintendent of the library and picture gallery,\r\nand one of my old servants, composed--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"The second lord of conjunction, Shahinshah Jahangir,\r\n    With justice and equity sat on the throne of happiness.\r\n    Prosperity, Good Fortune, Wealth, Dignity, and Victory,\r\n    With loins girt in his service, stood rejoicing before him.\r\n    It became the date of the accession when Prosperity\r\n    Placed his head at the feet of the Sahib-Qiran-i-Sani.\" [26]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo my son Khusrau a lakh of rupees was presented that he might build\r\nup for himself the house of Mun`im Khan, [27] the (former) Khankhanan,\r\noutside the fort. The administration and government of the Panjab was\r\nbestowed on Sa`id Khan, [28] who was one of the confidential nobles and\r\nconnected with my father by marriage. His origin was from the Moghul\r\ntribe, and his ancestors were in the service of my forefathers. At the\r\ntime of his taking leave, as it was said that his eunuchs oppressed and\r\ntyrannized over the weak and the poor, I sent a message to him that\r\nmy justice would not put up with oppression from anyone, and that in\r\nthe scales of equity neither smallness nor greatness was regarded. If\r\nafter this any cruelty or harshness should be observed on the part\r\nof his people, he would receive punishment without favour. [29]\r\n\r\nAgain, having previously bestowed on Shaikh Farid Bukhari, who\r\nhad been Mir Bakhshi in my father's service, a dress of honour, a\r\njewelled sword, a jewelled inkstand and pen, I confirmed him in the\r\nsame post, and in order to exalt him I said to him, \"I regard thee as\r\nSahibu-s-saif-wa-l-qalam\" (\"Captain Sword and Captain Pen\"). Muqim,\r\n[30] to whom my father had given at the end of his reign the title of\r\nWazir Khan and the viziership of his dominions, I selected for the same\r\ntitle, rank, and service. I also gave Khwajagi Fathu-llah a dress of\r\nhonour, and made him a bakhshi, as formerly `Abdu-r-Razzaq Ma`muri,\r\nalthough when I was prince he had left my service without cause or\r\nreason and had gone over to my father, I made bakhshi as formerly,\r\nand I gave him a dress of honour. To Aminu-d-daula, who when I was\r\nprince had the post of bakhshi, and without my leave had run away and\r\ntaken service with my revered father, not looking to his offences I\r\ngave the office of Atish-i-begi [31] (Head of the Artillery), which\r\nhe had held under my father. I left all those who were in possession\r\nof posts, both inside and outside, in the positions which they had\r\nwith my father. Sharif Khan [32] had lived with me from his early\r\nyears. When I was prince I had given him the title of khan, and when\r\nI left Allahabad to wait upon my honoured father I presented him\r\nwith a drum and the tuman-togh (standard of yak tails). I had also\r\npromoted him to the rank of 2,500 and given him the government of the\r\nprovince of Bihar. I gave him complete control over the province, and\r\nsent him off there. On the 4th of Rajab, being fifteen days after my\r\naccession, he waited upon me. I was exceedingly pleased at his coming,\r\nfor his connection with me is such that I look upon him as a brother,\r\na son, a friend, and a companion. As I had perfect confidence in his\r\nfriendship, intelligence, learning, and acquaintance with affairs,\r\nhaving made him Grand Vizier, I promoted him to the rank of 5,000 with\r\n5,000 horse and the lofty title of Amiru-l-umara, to which no title\r\nof my servants is superior. Though his position might have warranted\r\na higher rank, he himself represented to me that until some notable\r\nservice on his part had become perceptible to me he would not accept\r\na higher grade than that mentioned (5,000).\r\n\r\nAs the reality of the loyalty of my father's servants had not\r\nyet become apparent, and certain faults and errors and unbecoming\r\nintentions which were not approved at the throne of the Creator or\r\npleasing to His creatures had shown themselves, they of themselves\r\nbecame ashamed. Though on the day of my accession I had forgiven all\r\noffences and determined with myself that I would exact no retribution\r\nfor past deeds, yet on account of the suspicion that had been aroused\r\nin my mind about them I considered the Amiru-l-umara my guardian and\r\nprotector; although God Almighty is the guardian of all His servants,\r\nand is especially so of kings, because their existence is the cause\r\nof the contentment of the world. His father, `Abdu-s-Samad, who\r\nin the art of painting had no equal in the age, had obtained from\r\nthe late king (Jannat-ashyani) Humayun the title of Shirin-qalam\r\n(Sweet pen), and in his council had attained a great dignity and was\r\non intimate terms with him (the king). He was one of the chief men\r\nof Shiraz. My honoured father, on account of his former services,\r\npaid him great honour and reverence. I made Raja Man Singh--who was\r\none of the greatest and most trusted noblemen of my father, and had\r\nobtained alliances with this illustrious family, inasmuch as his aunt\r\nhad been in my father's house (i.e. was his wife), [33] and I had\r\nmarried his sister, and Khusrau and his sister Sultanu-n-nisa Begam,\r\nthe latter of whom is my eldest child, were born of her--as before,\r\nruler of the province of Bengal. Though as in consequence of certain\r\nof his acts he had no expectation of this favour towards himself,\r\nI dignified him with a charqab (vest without sleeves) as a robe of\r\nhonour, a jewelled sword, and one of my own horses, and sent him off to\r\nhis province, which is a place of (or can keep up) 50,000 horse. His\r\nfather was Raja Bhagwan Das. His grandfather, Raja Bihari Mal, was\r\nthe first of the Kachwaha Rajputs to have the honour of entering my\r\nfather's service, and he excelled his tribe in truth and sincerity\r\nof friendship, and in the quality of valour. After my accession, when\r\nall the nobles with their retinues presented themselves at my palace,\r\nit came into my mind that I should send this body of retainers under\r\nmy son, Sultan Parwiz, to make a holy war against the Rana, who was\r\none of evil deeds, and a foul infidel of the country of Hindustan,\r\nand in my father's time had had troops sent constantly against him,\r\nbut had not been driven off. In a fortunate hour I invested my said\r\nson with gorgeous robes of honour, a jewelled waist-sword, a jewelled\r\nwaist-dagger, and a rosary of pearls intermixed with rubies of great\r\nprice of the value of 72,000 rupees, `Iraq and Turkman horses and\r\nfamous elephants, and dismissed him. About 20,000 horsemen with nobles\r\nand chief leaders were appointed to this service. The first was Asaf\r\nKhan, who in my father's time was one of his confidential servants,\r\nand for a long time had been confirmed in the post of bakhshi and\r\nafterwards became diwan ba istiqlal (Chancellor with full powers);\r\nhim I advanced from the rank of an Amir to that of Vizier, and\r\npromoting him from the command of 2,500 horse to that of 5,000 made\r\nhim guardian to Parwiz. Having honoured him with a robe of honour,\r\njewelled waist-sword, a horse and an elephant, I ordered that all\r\nthe mansabdars (commanders), small and great, should not depart from\r\nsuch orders as he thought proper to give them. I made `Abdu-r-Razzaq\r\nMa`muri his bakhshi and Mukhtar Beg, Asaf Khan's paternal uncle, diwan\r\nto Parwiz. I also presented to Raja Jagannath, son of Raja Bihari Mal,\r\nwho had the rank of 5,000, a robe of honour and a jewelled waist-sword.\r\n\r\nAgain, I gave Rana Shankar, cousin of the Rana--to whom my father had\r\ngiven the title of Rana, proposing to send him with Khusrau against the\r\nRana, but at that time he (Akbar) became a shanqar (a falcon, i.e. he\r\ndied)--a robe of honour and a jewelled sword, and sent him with him.\r\n\r\nI presented Madho Singh, brother's son of Raja Man Singh, and Rawal\r\nSal Darbari with flags, from this consideration, that they were\r\nalways present at Court and belonged to the Sekhawat [34] Rajputs,\r\nand were confidential servants of my father. Each received also the\r\nrank of 3,000.\r\n\r\nI promoted Shaikh Ruknu-d-din the Afghan, to whom when I was\r\nprince I had given the title of Shir Khan, from the grade of 500 to\r\nthat of 3,500 Shir Khan is the head of his clan and a very valiant\r\nman. He lost his arm by the sword in service against the Uzbegs. [35]\r\n`Abdu-r-Rahman, son of Shaikh Abu-l-fazl, Maha Singh, grandson of Raja\r\nMan Singh, Zahid Khan, son of Sadiq Khan, Wazir Jamil, and Qara Khan\r\nTurkman were exalted to the rank of 2,000; all these obtained robes of\r\nhonour and horses, and were dismissed. Manohar also obtained leave to\r\njoin the expedition. He is of the tribe of the Sekhawat Kachhwahas,\r\nand on him in his young days my father bestowed many favours. He had\r\nlearned the Persian language, and, although from him up to Adam the\r\npower of understanding cannot be attributed to any one of his tribe,\r\nhe is not without intelligence. He makes Persian verses, and the\r\nfollowing is one of his couplets:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"The object of shade in Creation is this:\r\n    That no one place his foot on the light of my Lord, the Sun.\" [36]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the details were to be described of all the commanders and servants\r\nappointed by me, with the conditions and connections and rank of each,\r\nit would be a long business. Many of my immediate attendants and\r\npersonal followers and nobles' sons, house-born ones (khanazadan) and\r\nzealous Rajputs, petitioned to accompany this expedition. A thousand\r\nahadis, the meaning of which is single ones (Blochmann, p. 20),\r\nwere also appointed. In short, a force was collected together such\r\nthat if reliance on the Friend (God) were vouchsafed, it could have\r\nembarked on enmity and conflict with any one of the monarchs of power.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Soldiers came up from all sides,\r\n    Seizing life from heroes of the world in battle;\r\n    They had no fear of death from the sharp sword,\r\n    No terror of water [37] and no flight from fire;\r\n    In valour singular, in vigour a crowd,\r\n    Anvils in endurance, rocks in attack.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I was prince I had entrusted, in consequence of my extreme\r\nconfidence [38] in him, my own uzuk seal [39] to the Amiru-l-umara\r\n(Sharif), but when he was sent off to the province of Bihar I made\r\nit over to Parwiz. Now that Parwiz went off against the Rana, I made\r\nit over, according to the former arrangement, to the Amiru-l-umara.\r\n\r\nParwiz was born of Sahib-Jamal (Mistress of Beauty), the cousin [40]\r\nof Zain Khan Koka, who, in point of affinity, was on the same footing\r\n[41] as Mirza `Aziz Koka, in the 34th year of my father's reign,\r\nin the city of Kabul, two years and two months after the birth of\r\nKhusrau. After several other children had been born to me and had been\r\nreceived into God's mercy, a daughter was born of Karamsi, [42] who\r\nbelonged to the Rathor clan, and the child received the name of Bihar\r\nBanu Begam. To Jagat Gosa'in, [43] daughter of the Mota Raja (the fat\r\nraja), was born Sultan Khurram, in the 36th year of my father's reign,\r\ncorresponding to A.H. 999, [44] in the city of Lahore. His advent\r\nmade the world joyous (khurram), [45] and gradually, as his years\r\nincreased, so did his excellencies, and he was more attentive to my\r\nfather than all (my) other children, who was exceedingly pleased with\r\nand grateful for his services, and always recommended him to me and\r\nfrequently told me there was no comparison between him and my other\r\nchildren. He recognised him as his real child.\r\n\r\nAfter that (Khurram's birth) some other children were born who\r\ndied in infancy, and then within one month two sons were borne by\r\nconcubines. One of these I called Jahandar and the other Shahryar. [46]\r\n\r\nAbout this time there came a petition from Sa`id Khan with regard\r\nto granting leave to Mirza Ghazi, who was a son of the ruler of the\r\nprovince of Thathah (Tattah in Sind). [47] I said that as my father\r\nhad betrothed his sister to my son Khusrau, please God, when this\r\nalliance came into force, I would give him leave to return to Sind.\r\n\r\nA year before I became king I had determined that I would drink no\r\nwine on Friday eve, and I hope at the throne of God that He will keep\r\nme firm in this resolve as long as I live.\r\n\r\nTwenty thousand rupees were given to Mirza Muhammad Riza Sabzwari to\r\ndivide amongst the faqirs and the needy of Delhi. The viziership of\r\nmy dominions I gave in the proportions of half and half to Khan Beg,\r\n[48] to whom when I was prince I had given the title of Waziru-l-mulk,\r\nand to Wazir Khan [49] (Muqim), and I gave to Shaikh Farid Bukhari,\r\nwho held the rank of 4,000, that of 5,000. I promoted Ram Das\r\nKachhwaha, whom my father had favoured, and who held the rank of\r\n2,000, to that of 3,000. I sent dresses of honour to Mirza Rustam,\r\nson of Mirza Sultan Husain and grandson of Shah Isma`il, the ruler of\r\nQandahar, and to `Abdu-r-Rahim Khankhanan, son of Bairam Khan, and to\r\nIraj and Darab, his sons, and to other nobles attached to the Deccan\r\n(command). Barkhurdar, son of `Abdu-r-Rahman, son of Mu'ayyid Beg, as\r\nhe had come to court without a summons, I ordered back to his jagir.\r\n[50]It is not according to good manners to go to the king's banquet\r\nwithout a summons, otherwise there would be no forbidding of the\r\ndoors and walls to the foot of desire.\r\n\r\nA month had elapsed after my auspicious accession when Lala Beg, who\r\nwhile I was prince had obtained the title of Baz Bahadur, obtained\r\nthe blessing of waiting on me. His rank, which had been 1,500, was\r\nraised to 4,000. I promoted him to the Subah of Bihar and gave him\r\n2,000 rupees. Baz Bahadur is of the lineage of the special attendants\r\nof our family; his father's name was Nizam, and he was librarian to\r\nHumayun. Kesho Das Maru, who is a Rajput of the province of Mairtha\r\nand is greater in loyalty than his contemporaries, I promoted to the\r\nrank of 1,500. I directed the `ulama and the learned men of Islam\r\nto collect those of the distinctive appellations of God which were\r\neasy to remember, in order that I might make them into my rosary [51]\r\n(ward). On Friday eves [52] I associate with learned and pious men, and\r\nwith dervishes and recluses. When Qilij Khan, who was one of the old\r\nretainers of the State in my revered father's reign, was appointed to\r\nthe government of the province of Gujarat, I presented him with a lakh\r\nof rupees for his expenses. I raised Miran Sadr Jahan from the rank\r\nof 2,000 to that of 4,000. I knew him in my childhood when I read the\r\n\"Forty Sayings\" with Shaikh `Abdu-n-Nabi, [53] whose history is given\r\nin detail in the Akbarnama. From these early days till now Miran Sadr\r\nJahan has acted towards me with single-minded loyalty, and I regard him\r\nas my preceptor in religions matters (khalifa). Whilst I was prince\r\nand before my revered father's illness, and during that time, when\r\nthe ministers (pillars of the State) and the high nobles had become\r\nagitated, and each had conceived some idea of gain for himself and\r\nwished to become the originator of some act which could only bring\r\nruin on the State, he had not failed in the activity of his service\r\nand devotedness. Having made `Inayat Beg, [54] who for a long period\r\nin the reign of my father had been Master of Works (Diwan-i-buyutat)\r\nand held the rank of 700, half-vizier of my dominions in the place\r\nof Wazir Khan, I gave him the high title of I`timadu-d-daula with\r\nthe rank of 1,500, and I appointed Wazir Khan to the Diwani of the\r\nprovince of Bengal, and assigned to him the settlement of the revenues\r\nthereof. To Patr Das, who in the time of my father had the title of\r\nRay Rayan, I gave the title of Raja Bikramajit. The latter was one of\r\nthe great Rajas of India, and it was in his reign that astronomical\r\nobservatories were established in India. I made Patr Das Master of\r\nOrdnance, and ordered that he should always have light artillery\r\n[55] in the arsenal, 50,000 light guns [56] and 3,000 gun-carriages,\r\nready and in efficient order. He was a khatri by caste, and rose in\r\nmy father's service from being accountant of the elephants' stables\r\nto be diwan and an amir. He is not wanting in military qualities\r\nand in administrative skill. I made Khurram, the son of Khan A`zam\r\n(`Aziz Koka), who had had the rank of 2,000, an officer of 2,500.\r\n\r\nAs it was my desire that many of the Akbari and Jahangiri officers\r\nshould obtain the fruition of their wishes, I informed the bakhshis\r\nthat whoever wished to have his birthplace made into his jagir should\r\nmake a representation to that effect, so that in accordance with the\r\nChingiz canon (tura) the estate might be conveyed to him by al tamgha\r\nand become his property, and he might be secured from apprehension of\r\nchange. Our ancestors and forefathers were in the habit of granting\r\njagirs to everyone under proprietary title, and adorned the farmans\r\nfor these with the al tamgha seal, which is an impressed seal made in\r\nvermilion (i.e. red ink). I ordered that they should cover the place\r\nfor the seal, with gold-leaf (tilaposh) and impress the seal thereon,\r\nand I called this the altun [57] tamgha.\r\n\r\nI had selected from the other sons of Shahrukh, Mirza Sultan, [58] son\r\nof Mirza Shahrukh the grandson of Mirza Sulaiman, who was a descendant\r\n(great-grandson) of Mirza Sultan Abu Sa`id and for a long time ruler\r\nof Badakhshan, and with consent of my [59] revered father brought\r\nhim into my service. I count him as a son, and have promoted him to\r\nthe rank of 1,000. I also promoted Bhao Singh, son of Raja Man Singh\r\nand the most capable of his sons, from his original rank to that of\r\n1,500. I raised Zamana Beg, [60] son of Ghayur Beg of Kabul, who has\r\nserved me personally from his childhood, and who, when I was prince,\r\nrose from the grade of an ahadi to that of 500, giving him the title\r\nof Mahabat Khan and the rank of 1,500. He was confirmed as bakhshi\r\nof my private establishment (shagird-pisha).\r\n\r\nI promoted Raja Bir Singh Deo, a Bandela Rajput, who had obtained my\r\nfavour, and who excels his equals and relatives in valour, personal\r\ngoodness, and simple-heartedness, to the rank of 3,000. The reason\r\nfor his advancement and for the regard shown to him was that near the\r\nend of my revered father's time, Shaikh Abu-l-fazl, who excelled the\r\nShaikhzadas of Hindustan in wisdom and learning, had adorned himself\r\noutwardly with the jewel of sincerity, and sold it to my father at\r\na heavy price. He had been summoned from the Deccan, and, since his\r\nfeelings towards me were not honest, he both publicly and privately\r\nspoke against me. At this period when, through strife-exciting\r\nintriguers, the august feelings of my royal father were entirely\r\nembittered against me, it was certain that if he obtained the honour\r\nof waiting on him (Akbar) it would be the cause of more confusion, and\r\nwould preclude me from the favour of union with him (my father). It\r\nbecame necessary to prevent him from coming to Court. As Bir Singh\r\nDeo's country was exactly on his route and he was then a rebel, I\r\nsent him a message that if he would stop that sedition-monger and\r\nkill him he would receive every kindness from me. By God's grace,\r\nwhen Shaikh Abu-l-fazl was passing through Bir Singh Deo's country,\r\nthe Raja blocked his road, and after a little contest scattered his\r\nmen and killed him. He sent his head to me in Allahabad. Although this\r\nevent was a cause of anger in the mind of the late king (Akbar), in\r\nthe end it enabled me to proceed without disturbance of mind to kiss\r\nthe threshold of my father's palace, and by degrees the resentment\r\nof the king was cleared away.\r\n\r\nI made Mir Ziya'u-d-din of Qazwin, who had done me service in\r\nthe days of my princehood and had shown loyalty, commander of\r\n1,000 and accountant of the stables. An order was given that every\r\nday thirty horses should be produced before me for the purpose of\r\nmaking presents. I honoured Mirza `Ali Akbarshahi, who is one of the\r\ndistinguished braves of this family, [61] with the rank of 4,000,\r\nand gave him the sarkar of Sambhal as his jagir.\r\n\r\nOne day the Amiru-l-umara (Sharif Khan) greatly pleased me by an\r\nincidental remark. It was this: \"Honesty and dishonesty are not\r\nconfined to matters of cash and goods; to represent qualities as\r\nexisting in acquaintances which do not exist, and to conceal the\r\nmeritorious qualities of strangers, is dishonesty. In truth, honesty\r\nof speech consists in making no distinction between intimates and\r\nstrangers and in describing each man as he really is.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I sent off Parwiz I had said to him, \"If the Rana himself, and\r\nhis eldest son who is called Karan, should come to wait upon you and\r\nproffer service and obedience, you should not do any injury to his\r\nterritory.\" My intention in this recommendation was of two kinds;\r\none, that inasmuch as the conquest of Transoxiana was always in the\r\npure mind of my revered father, though every time he determined on it\r\nthings occurred to prevent it, if this business could be settled, and\r\nthis danger dismissed from my mind, I would leave Parwiz in Hindustan,\r\nand in reliance on Allah, myself start for my hereditary territories,\r\nespecially as at this time there was no permanent ruler in that\r\nregion. Baqi Khan, who, after `Abdu-llah Khan and `Abdu-l-Mu'min\r\nKhan, his son, had acquired complete independence, had died, and the\r\naffairs of Wali Muhammad Khan, his brother, who is now the ruler of\r\nthat region, had not as yet been brought into proper order. Secondly,\r\nto bring about the termination of the war in the Deccan, of which a\r\npart in the time of my revered father had been acquired, so that it\r\nmight come into possession, and be incorporated with the Imperial\r\ndominions. My hope is that through the favour of Allah both these\r\nundertakings will be accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Though a king should seize the seven climes, [62]\r\n    He still would labour to take others.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI promoted Mirza Shahrukh, [63] grandson of Mirza Sulaiman, (once)\r\nthe ruler of Badakhshan, who was nearly related to my family, and held\r\nthe rank of 5,000 in my father's service, to the rank of 7,000. The\r\nMirza is a true Turk in disposition and simple-minded. My father\r\nconferred great honour on him, and whenever he bade his own sons\r\nsit he gratified him also with this distinction. Notwithstanding the\r\nmischievous propensities of the people of Badakhshan, the Mirza in\r\nthis familiarity never left the right road, or undertook anything\r\nthat might lead to unpleasantness. I confirmed him in the Subah of\r\nMalwa just as my father had kindly conferred it on him.\r\n\r\nI conferred on Khwaja `Abdu-llah, who is of the Naqshbandi family,\r\nand in the commencement of his service was an ahadi, and who had\r\nrisen by degrees to the command of 1,000, but without reason had gone\r\ninto my father's service, the rank and jagir my father had conferred\r\non him. Although I considered it best for my own prosperity that my\r\nattendants and people should go into his (Akbar's) service, yet this\r\nhad occurred without my leave, and I was rather annoyed at it. But the\r\nfact is that he is a manly and zealous man; if he had not committed\r\nthis fault he would have been a faultless hero (jawan).\r\n\r\nAbu-n-nabi, [64] the Uzbeg, who is one of the distinguished inhabitants\r\nof Mawara'a-n-nahr and in the time of `Abdu-l-Mu'min Khan was governor\r\nof Mashhad, obtained the rank of 1,500.\r\n\r\nShaikh Hasan is the son of Shaikh Baha. [65] From the days of\r\nhis childhood to this day he has always been in my service and in\r\nattendance on me, and when I was prince was distinguished by the\r\ntitle of Muqarrab Khan. He was very active and alert in his service,\r\nand in hunting would often traverse long distances by my side. He\r\nis skilful with the arrow and the gun, and in surgery is the most\r\nskilful of his time. His ancestors also had been well practised\r\nin this profession. After my accession, in consequence of the\r\nperfect confidence I had in him, I sent him to Burhanpur to bring\r\nthe children and dependants of my brother Daniyal to wait on me,\r\nand sent a message to the Khankhanan in low and high words [66]\r\nand profitable admonitions. Muqarrab Khan performed this service\r\ncorrectly and in a short time, and, clearing off the suspicions which\r\nhad entered the minds of the Khankhanan and the nobles of that place,\r\nbrought those who had been left behind by my brother in safety and\r\nsecurity, together with his establishment and property and effects,\r\nto Lahore, and there presented them before me.\r\n\r\nI promoted Naqib Khan, [67] who is one of the genuine Sayyids of\r\nQazwin and is called Ghiyasu-d-din `Ali, to the rank of 1,500. My\r\nfather had distinguished him with the title of Naqib Khan, and in\r\nhis service he had complete intimacy and consideration. Shortly after\r\nhis accession he (Akbar) had discussed several matters with him, and\r\nfrom this familiarity he called him akhund. He has no equal or rival\r\nin the science of history and in biographies. There is in this day\r\nno chronologist like him in the inhabited world. From the beginning\r\nof Creation till the present time, he has by heart the tale of the\r\nfour quarters of the world. Has Allah granted to any other person\r\nsuch faculty of memory?\r\n\r\nShaikh Kabir, who was of the family of the venerable Shaikh Salim,\r\nI had honoured with the title of Shaja`at Khan when I was prince,\r\non account of his manliness and bravery. I now selected him for the\r\nrank of 1,000.\r\n\r\nOn Sha`ban 27th (28th December, 1605) a strange thing was done by\r\nthe sons of Akhayraj, son of Bhagwan Das, the paternal uncle [68] of\r\nRaja Man Singh. These unlucky ones, who bore the names of Abhay Ram,\r\nBijay Ram, and Shyam Ram, were exceedingly immoderate. Notwithstanding\r\nthat the aforesaid Abhay Ram had done improper (disproportioned) acts,\r\nI had winked at his faults. When at this date it was represented to me\r\nthat this wretch was desirous of despatching his wives and children\r\nwithout leave to his own country and afterwards of himself running\r\naway to the Rana, who is not loyal to this family, I referred to\r\nRam Das and other Rajput nobles, and said to them that if any one\r\nof them would become security for them, I would confirm the rank\r\nand jagir of those wretches, and passing over their offences would\r\nforgive them. In consequence of their excessive turbulence and bad\r\ndisposition no one became security. I told the Amiru-l-umara that\r\nas no one would be bound for them, they must be handed over to\r\nthe charge of one of the servants of the Court until security was\r\nforthcoming. The Amiru-l-umara gave them over to Ibrahim Khan Kakar,\r\nwho was afterwards dignified with the title of Dilawar Khan, and Hatim,\r\n[69] second son of Mangli, who held the title of Shahnawaz Khan. [70]\r\nWhen these wished to disarm these foolish people, they refused,\r\nand, not observing the dues of good manners, began, together with\r\ntheir servants, to quarrel and fight. The Amiru-l-umara reported the\r\ncircumstance to me, and I ordered them to be punished according to\r\ntheir deeds. He betook himself to driving them off, and I sent Shaikh\r\nFarid also after him. One Rajput armed with a sword, and another with\r\na dagger stood up to the Amiru-l-umara. One of his attendants named\r\nQutb engaged the man with the dagger and was killed. The Rajput also\r\nwas cut to pieces. One of the Afghan attendants of the Amiru-l-umara\r\nattacked the one who had the sword and killed him. Dilawar Khan drew\r\nhis dagger and turned towards Abhay Ram, who with two others was\r\nholding his ground, and after wounding one of these fell down after\r\nreceiving wounds from the three. Some of the ahadis and the men of\r\nthe Amiru-l-umara opposed and slew these doomed men. A Rajput drew\r\nhis sword and turned to Shaikh Farid; he was met by a Habshi slave,\r\nwho brought him down. This disturbance took place in the courtyard\r\nof the public palace. That punishment served as a warning to many\r\nwho had not looked to consequences. Abu-n-nabi [71] represented that\r\nif such a deed had been done in the Uzbeg country the whole family\r\nand connections of that band of men would have been destroyed. I\r\nreplied that as these people had been treated kindly and educated\r\nby my revered father I carried on the same benevolence to them, and\r\njustice demands that many shall not be chastised for the fault of one.\r\n\r\nShaikh Husain Jami, who now sits on the cushion of darwishi and is\r\none of the disciples of the dervish of Shiraz, [72] had written to\r\nme from Lahore six months before my accession that he had seen in a\r\ndream that saints and pious men had delivered over the affairs of\r\nthe kingdom to that chosen one of the Court of Allah (Jahangir),\r\nand that, rejoicing in this good news, he should await the event,\r\nand that he hoped that when it had occurred, the faults of Khwaja\r\nZakariyya, who was one of the Ahrariyya, [73] would be pardoned. [74]\r\n\r\nI conferred on Tash Beg Furji, [75] who was one of the old servants of\r\nthe State, and whom my father had honoured with the title of Taj Khan,\r\nand who had the rank of 2,000, that of 3,000, and I raised Tukhta [76]\r\nBeg Kabuli from the rank of 2,500 to that of 3,000. He is a brave\r\nand active man, and was greatly trusted in the service of my uncle,\r\nMirza Muhammad Hakim. I promoted Abu-l-Qasim Tamkin, [77] who was\r\none of my father's old servants, to the rank of 1,500. There are\r\nfew men such as he for abundance of children; he has thirty sons,\r\nand if his daughters do not number so many they must be half that\r\nnumber. I dignified Shaikh `Ala'u-d-din, grandson of Shaikh Salim,\r\nwho had strong connections with me, with the title of Islam Khan,\r\nand promoted him to the rank of 2,000. He had grown up with me from\r\nhis childhood, and may be a year younger than I. He is a brave and\r\nwell-dispositioned youth, and is distinguished in every way above\r\nhis family. Till now he has never drunk intoxicating drinks, and his\r\nsincerity towards me is such that I have honoured him with the title\r\nof son.\r\n\r\nI have bestowed on `Ali Asghar Barha, who has not a rival in bravery\r\nand zeal, and is the son of Sayyid Mahmud Khan Barha, one of my\r\nfather's old nobles, the title of Saif Khan, and thus distinguished him\r\namongst his equals and connections. He is evidently a brave youth. He\r\nwas always one of the confidential men who went with me to hunt and to\r\nother places. He has never in his life drunk anything intoxicating,\r\nand as he has abstained in his youth he probably will attain high\r\ndignities. I granted him the rank of 3,000.\r\n\r\nI promoted Faridun, son of Muhammad Quli Khan Barlas, who held the rank\r\nof 1,000, to that of 2,000. Faridun is one of the tribe of Chaghatay,\r\nand is not devoid of manliness and courage.\r\n\r\nI promoted Shaikh Bayazid, grandson of Shaikh Salim, who held the\r\nrank of 2,000, to that of 3,000. The first person who gave me milk,\r\nbut for not more than a day, was the mother of Shaikh Bayazid.\r\n\r\n[78]One day I observed to the Pandits, that is, the wise men of\r\nthe Hindus, \"If the doctrines of your religion are based on the\r\nincarnation of the Holy Person of God Almighty in ten different forms\r\nby the process of metempsychosis, they are virtually rejected by the\r\nintelligent. This pernicious idea requires that the Sublime Cause,\r\nwho is void of all limitations, should be possessed of length,\r\nbreadth, and thickness. If the purpose is the manifestation of the\r\nLight of God in these bodies, that of itself is existent equally in\r\nall created things, and is not peculiar to these ten forms. If the\r\nidea is to establish some one of God's attributes, even then there\r\nis no right notion, for in every faith and code there are masters\r\nof wonders and miracles distinguished beyond the other men of their\r\nage for wisdom and eloquence.\" [79] After much argument and endless\r\ncontroversy, they acknowledged a God of Gods, devoid of a body or\r\naccidents, [80] and said, \"As our imagination fails to conceive a\r\nformless personality (zat-i-mujarrad), we do not find any way to\r\nknow Him without the aid of a form. We have therefore made these\r\nten forms the means of conceiving of and knowing Him.\" Then said I,\r\n\"How can these forms be a means of your approaching the Deity?\"\r\n\r\nMy father always associated with the learned of every creed and\r\nreligion, especially with Pandits and the learned of India, and\r\nalthough he was illiterate, so much became clear to him through\r\nconstant intercourse with the learned and wise, in his conversations\r\nwith them, that no one knew him to be illiterate, and he was so\r\nacquainted with the niceties of verse and prose compositions that\r\nhis deficiency was not thought of.\r\n\r\nIn his august personal appearance he was of middle height, but\r\ninclining to be tall; he was of the hue of wheat; his eyes and\r\neyebrows were black, and his complexion rather dark than fair;\r\nhe was lion-bodied, [81] with a broad chest, and his hands and\r\narms long. On the left side of his nose he had a fleshy mole, very\r\nagreeable in appearance, of the size of half a pea. Those skilled\r\nin the science of physiognomy considered this mole a sign of great\r\nprosperity and exceeding good fortune. His august voice was very\r\nloud, and in speaking and explaining had a peculiar richness. In\r\nhis actions and movements he was not like the people of the world,\r\nand the glory of God manifested itself in him.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Greatness in his manner, kingship in his lineage,\r\n    As if Solomon would have put the ring on his finger.\" [82]\r\n\r\n\r\nThree months after my birth my sister, Shahzada Khanam, was born to one\r\nof the royal concubines; they gave her over to his (Akbar's) mother,\r\nMaryam Makani. After her a son was born to one of the concubines,\r\nand received the name of Shah Murad. As his birth occurred in the\r\nhill country of Fathpur, he was nicknamed Pahari. When my revered\r\nfather sent him to conquer the Deccan, he had taken to excessive\r\ndrinking through associating with unworthy persons, so that he died\r\nin his 30th year, in the neighbourhood of Jalnapur, in the province\r\nof Berar. His personal appearance was fresh-coloured; he was thin\r\nin body and tall of stature. Dignity and authority were evident in\r\nhis movements, and manliness and bravery manifested themselves in\r\nhis ways. On the night of Jumada-l-awwal 10th, A.H. 979 (September,\r\n1572), another son was born to one of the concubines. As his birth\r\ntook place at Ajmir in the house of one of the attendants of the\r\nblessed shrine of the reverend Khwaja Mu`inu-d-din Chishti, whose\r\nname was Shaikh Daniyal, this child was called Daniyal.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of my brother Shah Murad, he (Akbar), towards the\r\nend of his reign, sent Daniyal to conquer the Deccan and followed\r\nhim himself. When my revered father was besieging Asir (Asirgarh) he,\r\nwith a large body of nobles such as the Khankhanan and his sons and\r\nMirza Yusuf Khan, invested the fort of Ahmadnagar, and it came into\r\nthe possession of the victorious officers about the time that Asir\r\nwas taken. After my father `Arsh-ashyani had returned in prosperity\r\nand victory from Burhanpur towards his capital, he gave the province\r\nto Daniyal and left him in possession of that territory. Daniyal took\r\nto improper ways, like his brother Shah Murad, and soon died from\r\nexcessive drinking, in the 33rd year of his age. His death occurred\r\nin a peculiar way. He was very fond of guns and of hunting with the\r\ngun. He named one of his guns yaka u janaza, 'the same as the bier,'\r\nand himself composed this couplet and had it engraved on the gun:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"From the joy of the chase with thee, life is fresh and new;\r\n    To everyone whom thy dart strikes, 'tis the same as his bier.\" [83]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen his drinking of wine was carried to excess, and the circumstance\r\nwas reported to my father, farmans of reproach were sent to the\r\nKhankhanan. Of course he forbade it, and placed cautious people to look\r\nafter him properly. When the road to bring wine was completely closed,\r\nhe began to weep and to importune some of his servants, and said:\r\n\"Let them bring me wine in any possible way.\" He said to Murshid\r\nQuli Khan, a musketeer who was in his immediate service: \"Pour some\r\nwine into this yaka u janaza, and bring it to me.\" That wretch, in\r\nhope of favour, undertook to do this, and poured double-distilled\r\nspirit into the gun, which had long been nourished on gunpowder and\r\nthe scent thereof, and brought it. The rust of the iron was dissolved\r\nby the strength of the spirit and mingled with it, and the prince no\r\nsooner drank of it than he fell down.\r\n\r\n\r\n           \"No one should draw a bad omen: [84]\r\n            If he does, he draws it for himself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDaniyal was of pleasing figure, of exceedingly agreeable manners and\r\nappearance; he was very fond of elephants and horses. It was impossible\r\nfor him to hear of anyone as having a good horse or elephant and not\r\ntake it from him. He was fond of Hindi songs, and would occasionally\r\ncompose verses with correct idiom in the language of the people of\r\nIndia, which were not bad.\r\n\r\nAfter the birth of Daniyal a daughter was born to Bibi Daulat-Shad\r\nwhom they named Shakaru-n-nisa Begam. [85] As she was brought\r\nup in the skirt of my revered father's care, she turned out very\r\nwell. She is of good disposition and naturally compassionate towards\r\nall people. From infancy and childhood she has been extremely fond\r\nof me, and there can be few such relationships between brother and\r\nsister. The first time when, according to the custom of pressing the\r\nbreast of a child and a drop of milk is perceptible, they pressed\r\nmy sister's breast and milk appeared, my revered father said to me:\r\n\"Baba! drink this milk, that in truth this sister may be to thee as a\r\nmother.\" God, the knower of secrets, knows that from that day forward,\r\nafter I drank that drop of milk, I have felt love for my sister such\r\nas children have for their mothers.\r\n\r\nAfter some time another girl was born to this same Bibi Daulat-Shad,\r\nand he (Akbar) called her Aram Banu Begam. [86] Her disposition was on\r\nthe whole inclined to excitement and heat. My father was very fond of\r\nher, so much so that he described her impolitenesses as politenesses,\r\nand in his august sight they, from his great love, did not appear\r\nbad. Repeatedly he honoured me by addressing me, and said: \"Baba! for\r\nmy sake be as kind as I am, after me, to this sister, who in Hindi\r\nphrase is my darling (that is, dearly cherished). Be affectionate to\r\nher and pass over her little impolitenesses and impudences.\"\r\n\r\nThe good qualities of my revered father are beyond the limit of\r\napproval and the bounds of praise. If books were composed with regard\r\nto his commendable dispositions, without suspicion of extravagance,\r\nand he be not looked at as a father would be by his son, even then\r\nbut a little out of much could be said.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his kingship and his treasures and his buried\r\nwealth, which were beyond the scope of counting and imagination,\r\nhis fighting elephants and Arab horses, he never by a hair's breadth\r\nplaced his foot beyond the base of humility before the throne of God,\r\nbut considered himself the lowest of created beings, and never for\r\none moment forgot God.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Always, everywhere, with everyone, and in every circumstance,\r\n    Keep the eye of thy heart secretly fixed on the Beloved.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe professors of various faiths had room in the broad expanse of\r\nhis incomparable sway. This was different from the practice in other\r\nrealms, for in Persia [87] there is room for Shias only, and in Turkey,\r\nIndia, and Turan there is room for Sunnis only.\r\n\r\nAs in the wide expanse of the Divine compassion there is room for\r\nall classes and the followers of all creeds, so, on the principle\r\nthat the Shadow [88] must have the same properties as the Light,\r\nin his dominions, which on all sides were limited only by the salt\r\nsea, there was room for the professors of opposite religions, and for\r\nbeliefs good and bad, and the road to altercation was closed. Sunnis\r\nand Shias met in one mosque, and Franks and Jews in one church,\r\nand observed their own forms of worship.\r\n\r\nHe associated with the good of every race and creed and persuasion,\r\nand was gracious to all in accordance with their condition and\r\nunderstanding. He passed his nights in wakefulness, and slept little\r\nin the day; the length of his sleep during a whole night and day\r\n(nycthemeron) was not more than a watch and a half. He counted his\r\nwakefulness at night as so much added to his life. His courage and\r\nboldness were such that he could mount raging, rutting elephants, and\r\nsubdue to obedience murderous elephants which would not allow their own\r\nfemales near them--although even when an elephant is bad-tempered he\r\ndoes no harm to the female or his driver--and which were in a state\r\nin which they might have killed their drivers or the females, or not\r\nhave allowed their approach. He would place himself on a wall or tree\r\nnear which an elephant was passing that had killed its mahout and\r\nbroken loose from restraint, and, putting his trust in God's favour,\r\nwould throw himself on its back and thus by merely mounting, would\r\nbring it under control and tame it. This was repeatedly seen.\r\n\r\nHe ascended the throne in his 14th year. Hemu, the infidel whom the\r\nAfghan ruler had raised to high station, collected a wonderful force\r\nafter King Humayun's death with a stud of elephants such as no ruler\r\nof Hindustan had at that time, and he went towards Delhi. Humayun had\r\nappointed Akbar to drive off some of the Afghans from the foot-hills\r\nof the Panjab, but just then he exemplified the hemistich which is\r\na description of the accident and the chronogram of his death--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"The august monarch (Humayun) fell from the roof. The news (of\r\n    the death) was conveyed to my father by Nazar-jivi.\" [89]\r\n\r\n\r\nBairam Khan, who was then his tutor, having collected the nobles who\r\nwere in the province, chose an auspicious hour and seated him on the\r\nthrone of rule in pargana Kalanur, near Lahore.\r\n\r\nWhen Hemu reached the neighbourhood of Delhi, Tardi Beg Khan and\r\na large force that was in the city drew up to oppose him. When the\r\npreparations for the combat had been made the armies attacked one\r\nanother, and, after considerable endeavours and strife, defeat fell\r\non Tardi Beg Khan and the Moguls, and the army of darkness overcame\r\nthe army of light.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"All things and battles and fights are of God,\r\n    He knows whose will be the victory.\r\n    From the blood of the brave and the dust of the troops,\r\n    The earth grew red and the heavens black.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTardi Beg Khan and the other defeated ones took the road to my revered\r\nfather's camp. As Bairam Khan disliked Tardi Beg, he made this defeat\r\nan excuse to put him to death.\r\n\r\nA second time, through the pride engendered in the mind of this\r\naccursed infidel by his victory, he came out of Delhi with his force\r\nand elephants and advanced, while the glorious standards of His\r\nMajesty (Akbar) proceeded from Kalanur for the purpose of driving\r\nhim away. The armies of darkness and light met in the neighbourhood\r\nof Panipat, and on Thursday, Muharram 2nd, A.H. 964 (November 5th,\r\n1556), a fight took place. In the army of Hemu were 30,000 brave\r\nfighting horsemen, while the ghazis of the victorious army were not\r\nmore than 4,000 or 5,000. On that day Hemu was riding an elephant\r\nnamed Hawa'i. Suddenly an arrow struck the eye of that infidel and\r\ncame out at the back of his head. His army, on seeing this, took to\r\nflight. By chance Shah Quli Khan Mahram with a few brave men came up\r\nto the elephant on which was the wounded Hemu, and would have shot an\r\narrow at the driver, but he cried \"Do not kill me; Hemu is on this\r\nelephant.\" A number of men immediately conveyed Hemu as he was to\r\nthe king (Akbar). Bairam Khan represented that it would be proper if\r\nthe king with his own hand should strike the infidel with a sword,\r\nso that obtaining the reward of a ghazi (warrior of the Faith) he\r\nmight use this title on the imperial farmans. The king answered,\r\n\"I have cut him in pieces before this,\" and explained: \"One day,\r\nin Kabul, I was copying a picture in presence of Khwaja`Abdu-s-Samad\r\nShirin Qalam, when a form appeared from my brush, the parts of which\r\nwere separate and divided from each other. One of those near asked,\r\n'Whose picture is this?' It came to my tongue to say that it was the\r\nlikeness of Hemu.\" Not defiling his hand with his (Hemu's) blood,\r\nhe told one of his servants to cut off his head. Those killed in the\r\ndefeated army numbered 5,000 in addition to those who fell in various\r\nplaces round about.\r\n\r\nAnother of the well-known deeds of Akbar was the victorious expedition\r\nagainst Gujarat, and his rapid march there, at the time when Mirza\r\nIbrahim Husain, Muhammad Husain Mirza, and Shah Mirza revolted from\r\nthis State and went towards Gujarat, and all the nobles of that\r\nprovince, combining with the turbulent of those parts, besieged\r\nthe fort of Ahmadabad in which was Mirza `Aziz Koka with the royal\r\narmy. His Majesty, in consequence of the distracted state of Jiji Anga,\r\nthe mother of the last-named Mirza, started for Gujarat with a body\r\nof royal troops without delay from the capital of Fathpur. Having\r\ncovered in the space of nine days the long road which it should take\r\ntwo months to accomplish, sometimes on horseback, sometimes on a\r\ncamel or in a bullock-cart, he arrived at Sarnal.\r\n\r\nWhen, on 5th Jumada-l-awwal, 980 (September 15th, 1572), he reached\r\nthe neighbourhood of the enemy's camp, he consulted with those who\r\nwere loyal to him. Some said he should make a night attack on the\r\ncamp. His Majesty, however, said that a night attack was the resort\r\nof the faint-hearted and the way of the deceitful, and immediately\r\ngave orders to beat the drums and set the horsemen at them. When\r\nthe river Sabar Mahi (Sabarmati) was reached, he ordered his men to\r\ncross it in order. Muhammad Husain Mirza was agitated by the noise of\r\nthe army of victory, and himself came forward to reconnoitre. Subhan\r\nQuli Turk, also with a troop of brave men, went to the river's bank\r\nto enquire into the enemy's position. The Mirza asked what troops\r\nthese were. Subhan Quli replied that they were of the army of King\r\nJalalu-d-din Akbar. That ill-fated one would not believe this, and said\r\nhis spies had seen the king fourteen days before in Fathpur, and that\r\nit was clear Subhan Quli was lying. To this Subhan Quli rejoined, \"Nine\r\ndays ago the king with this expedition started from Fathpur.\" \"How\r\ncould elephants have come?\" [90] asked the Mirza. \"What need was there\r\nof elephants?\" answered Subhan Quli. \"Young men and heroes who cleave\r\nrocks, and are better than famous and raging elephants, have come;\r\nthe difference between loyalty and sedition will now become known.\" The\r\nMirza, after this conversation, turned aside and began to marshal his\r\ntroops. The king waited until his advanced guard sent word that the\r\nenemy had put on their armour. He then moved forward, and although\r\nhe sent several times to order the Khan A`zam to advance, the latter\r\nstood still. It was said to Akbar that, as the enemy was in force,\r\nit would be well to remain on his side of the river until the army of\r\nGujarat arrived from within the fort. His Majesty answered: \"Always,\r\nand especially in this affair, I have put my trust in God. If I had\r\nconsidered routine, I should not have come in this rapid manner. Now\r\nthat our foe is ready for the fight, we ought not to delay.\" With\r\nthese words, and with his innate reliance on God as his shield,\r\nhe put his horse into the river with a few chosen men whom he had\r\nappointed to ride with him. Though it was not supposed that there was\r\na ford, he crossed in safety. He had called for his helmet, but in\r\nthe agitation of bringing it his armour-bearer dropped the face-guard\r\n(buffe). His comrades did not regard this as a good omen, but he said\r\nat once, \"It is an excellent omen, for it has revealed my face.\" [91]\r\nMeantime the wretched Mirza arrayed his ranks to fight his benefactor.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"If thou come out (to fight) with thy benefactor,\r\n    If thou wert the sphere, thou wouldest be reversed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Khan A`zam had had no idea that the king would cast the shadow\r\nof his compassion on these regions with such speed and eagerness,\r\nand he believed no one who gave him news of that arrival, until\r\nconvinced by visible proof. Then, arraying the army of Gujarat, he\r\nprepared to march. Meanwhile Asaf Khan also sent news to him. Before\r\nhis army issued from the fort the enemy had appeared from amongst the\r\ntrees. The king, taking the Divine aid as the security of his courage,\r\nstarted off. Muhammad Quli Khan Turk and Tardi Khan Diwana came\r\nforward with a band of brave followers, and after a little fighting\r\nturned rein. On this His Majesty said to Bhagwan Das, \"The enemy are\r\nunnumbered and we are few; we must attack with one face and one heart;\r\nfor a clenched fist is more useful than an open hand.\" With these\r\nwords he drew his sword, and with shout of Allahu-akbar and Ya Mu`in\r\n[92] charged with those devoted to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"The sense of the age evaporated with the clamour,\r\n    The ear of the heavens was split with the shouts.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe royal right and left wings and a band of brave men in the centre\r\nfought with valour. Stars (kaukaba'i), which are a kind of firework,\r\nwere lighted by the enemy; they twisted about among the thorn-bushes,\r\nand created such confusion that a noted elephant of the enemy began\r\nto move and threw their troops into disarray. With this the royal\r\ncentre came up and dispersed Muhammad Husain and his force. Man\r\nSingh Darbari overcame his foe under the king's eyes, and Ragho\r\nDas Kachhwaha sacrificed his life. Muhammad Wafa, who was of the\r\nhouse-born of the State, behaving very bravely, fell wounded from\r\nhis horse. By the favour of the Creator who cherishes His servants,\r\nand simply through the courage and good fortune of the exalted king,\r\nthe enemy were scattered and defeated. In gratitude for this great\r\nvictory the king turned his face in supplication to the throne of\r\nhis merciful Maker, and poured forth his thanks.\r\n\r\nOne of the kalawants (musicians) represented to His Majesty that Saif\r\nKhan Kokaltash had offered the coin of his life in loyalty to the\r\nState, and on enquiry it appeared that when Muhammad Husain Mirza with\r\nsome of his riffraff was attacking the centre Saif Khan met him and\r\nfighting valiantly became a martyr. The Mirza himself was wounded by\r\nthe hands of the brave men of the main body. The Kokaltash mentioned\r\nis the elder brother of Zain Khan Koka.\r\n\r\nA strange circumstance was this: on the day before the battle,\r\nwhen the king was eating, he asked Hazara, who was learned in the\r\nscience of looking at the shoulder-blades (a kind of divination),\r\nto see on whose side the victory would be. Hazara said: \"The victory\r\nwill be on your side, but one of the chiefs of your army will become\r\na martyr.\" Whereupon Saif Khan Koka said \"Would that this blessing\r\nmight fall to my lot!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Many an omen that we have treated as jest [93]\r\n    Became true when the star passed by.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn short, Mirza Muhammad Husain turned his reins, but his horse's feet\r\nbecame entangled in the thorn-brake and he fell. An ahadi of the king,\r\nGada `Ali by name, found him, and having mounted him before him on\r\nhis horse took him to the king. As two or three claimed a share in\r\nhis capture, His Majesty asked who had made him prisoner. \"The king's\r\nsalt,\" he answered. The king ordered his hands, that had been fastened\r\nbehind him, to be tied in front. Meanwhile he asked for water. Farhat\r\nKhan, who was one of the confidential slaves, struck him on the head,\r\nbut the king, disapproving of this, sent for his private drinking\r\nwater and satisfied his thirst. Up to this time Mirza `Aziz Koka\r\nand the garrison of the fort had not come out. After the capture of\r\nthe Mirza, His Majesty was proceeding slowly towards Ahmadabad. He\r\nhad delivered the Mirza to Ray Ray Singh Rathor, one of the Rajput\r\nchiefs, to be put on an elephant and brought with him. Meanwhile\r\nIkhtiyaru-l-mulk, who was one of the influential Gujarati leaders,\r\nmade his appearance with an army of nearly 5,000 men. Complete\r\nconfusion fell upon the royal troops. The king, as his natural valour\r\nand lofty disposition required, ordered the drums to be beaten, and\r\nShaja'at Khan, Raja Bhagwan Das, and some others charged on in front\r\nto fight this force. Fearing that the enemy might get possession of\r\nMirza Muhammad Husain, Ray Ray Singh's men, by the advice and plan of\r\nthe aforesaid Raja (Bhagwan Das), cut off his head. My father did not\r\nwant to kill him. The forces of Ikhtiyaru-l-mulk also were dispersed,\r\nand he was thrown from his horse into the thorn thicket. Suhrab Beg\r\nTurkman cut off his head and brought it in. It was only by the grace\r\nand power of God that such a victory was won by a small number of men.\r\n\r\nIn the same way are beyond all reckoning the conquest of the province\r\nof Bengal, the capture of well-known and celebrated forts in Hindustan\r\nsuch as Chitor and Rantambhor, the subjection of the province of\r\nKhandesh, and the taking of the fort of Asir and of other provinces\r\nwhich by the exertions of the royal armies came into the possession\r\nof the servants of the State. If these were related in detail it\r\nwould be a long story.\r\n\r\nIn the fight at Chitor, the king with his own hand killed Jitmal,\r\nthe leader of the men in the fort. He had no rival in shooting with\r\na gun, and with the one with which he killed Jitmal, and which was\r\ncalled Sangram, he killed some 3,000 or 4,000 birds and beasts. [94]\r\nI may be reckoned a true pupil of his. Of all sports I am most disposed\r\nto that with the gun, and in one day have shot eighteen deer.\r\n\r\nOf the austerities practised by my revered father, one was the not\r\neating the flesh of animals. During three months of the year he ate\r\nmeat, and for the remaining nine contented himself with Sufi food,\r\nand was no way pleased with the slaughter of animals. On many days\r\nand in many months this was forbidden to the people. The days and\r\nmonths on which he did not eat flesh are detailed in the Akbarnama.\r\n\r\nOn the day I made I`timadu-l-mulk diwan, I put Mu`izzu-l-mulk in\r\ncharge of the diwani-i-buyutat (care of buildings). The latter is a\r\nSayyid of Bakharz, [95] and under my revered father was accountant\r\nof the kurkaraq department. [96]\r\n\r\nOn one of my accession days, a hundred of the Akbari and Jahangiri\r\nservants were promoted to higher rank and jagirs. At the commencement\r\nof the Ramazan `Id, as it was the first after my accession, I came\r\ndown to the `Idgah from my auspicious throne. There was a great crowd,\r\nand having performed the dues of thanksgiving and praise I returned\r\nto the palace, where according to the verse \"From the table of kings\r\nfavours come to beggars,\" I commanded a sum of money to be spent\r\nin alms and charity. Some lakhs of dams of this were entrusted to\r\nDust Muhammad (afterwards Khwaja Jahan), who divided them amongst\r\nfaqirs and those who were in want, and a lakh of dams each was given\r\nto Jamalu-d-din Husain Anju (the lexicographer), Mirza Sadr Jahan,\r\nand Mir Muhammad Riza Sabzawari to dispose of in charity in different\r\nquarters of the city. I sent 5,000 rupees to the dervishes of Shaikh\r\nMuhammad Husain Jami, and gave directions that each day one of the\r\nofficers of the watch [97] should give 50,000 dams to faqirs. I sent a\r\njewelled sword to the Khankhanan, and promoted Jamalu-d-din Anju to the\r\nrank of 3,000. The office of Sadr was entrusted to Miran Sadr Jahan,\r\nand I ordered Haji Koka, who was one of my father's foster-sisters,\r\n[98] to bring before me in the palace such women as were worthy to be\r\npresented with land and money. I promoted Zahid Khan, son of Muhammad\r\nSadiq Khan, from the rank of 1,500 to that of 2,000.\r\n\r\nIt had been the custom [99] that when the gift of an elephant or\r\nhorse was made to anyone, the naqibs and the Masters of the Horse (Mir\r\nAkhuran) took from him a sum of money as jilawana (bridle-money). I\r\ngave orders that this money should be paid by the government, so that\r\npeople might be freed from the importunities and demands of that set\r\nof men.\r\n\r\nAt this time Salbahan arrived from Burhanpur and produced before me the\r\nhorses and elephants of my deceased brother Daniyal. Of the elephants,\r\none male named Mast Alast appeared to me the best, and I gave him the\r\nname of Nur Gaj. A wonderful thing showed itself in this elephant; on\r\nthe sides of his ears small lumps had grown about the size of melons,\r\nand from them came fluid such as drops from an elephant in the rutting\r\nseason; moreover, the top of his forehead was more prominent than in\r\nother elephants. It was a splendid and imposing animal. [100]\r\n\r\nI gave to my son Khurram (Shah-Jahan) a rosary of jewels, with the\r\nhope that he might obtain fulfilment of all his desires, both in\r\nvisible and in spiritual things.\r\n\r\nAs I had remitted in my dominions customs duties amounting to krors,\r\nI abolished also all the transit dues (sa'ir-jihat) in Kabul, which is\r\none of the noted towns on the road to Hindustan. These brought in 1\r\nkror and 23 lakhs of dams. From the provinces of Kabul and Qandahar\r\nlarge sums used to be derived every year from customs (zaka't),\r\nwhich were in fact the chief revenue of those places. I remitted\r\nthese ancient dues, a proceeding that greatly benefited the people\r\nof Iran and Turan.\r\n\r\nAsaf Khan's jagir in the subah of Bihar had been given to Baz Bahadur;\r\nI therefore ordered that a jagir in the Panjab should be given to\r\nhim. As it was represented to me that a large sum was in arrears\r\nin his jagir, and now that the order for exchange had been given\r\nits collection would be difficult, I directed that a lakh of rupees\r\nshould be given to him from the Treasury and the arrears recovered\r\nfrom Baz Bahadur for the royal revenues.\r\n\r\nI promoted Sharif Amuli to the rank of 2,500, original and increase. He\r\nis a pure-hearted, lively-spirited man. Though he has no tincture of\r\ncurrent sciences, lofty words and exalted knowledge often manifest\r\nthemselves in him. In the dress of a faqir he made many journeys, and\r\nhe has friendship with many saints and recites the maxims of those\r\nwho profess mysticism. This is his conversation, not his practice\r\n(qali-u ast na hali). In the time of my revered father he relinquished\r\nthe garments of poverty and asceticism, and attained to amirship and\r\nchiefship. His utterance is exceedingly powerful, and his conversation\r\nis remarkably eloquent and pure, although he is without Arabic. His\r\ncompositions also are not devoid of verve. [101]\r\n\r\nA garden in Agra had been left by Shah Quli Khan Mahram, and as he\r\nhad no heirs I handed it over to Ruqayya Sultan Begam, the daughter\r\nof Hindal Mirza, who had been the honoured wife of my father. [102]\r\nMy father had given my son Khurram into her charge, and she loved\r\nhim a thousand times more than if he had been her own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT FEAST OF NAURUZ.\r\n\r\nOn the night of Tuesday, Zi-l-qa`da 11th, A.H. 1014 (March 11th or\r\n12th, 1606), in the morning, which is the time of the blessing of\r\nlight, his Eminence the Great Luminary passed from the constellation of\r\nthe Fish to the House of Honour in the constellation of the Ram. As\r\nthis was the first New Year's Day after my auspicious accession\r\nI ordered them to decorate the porticoes of the private and public\r\nhalls of the palace, as in the time of my revered father, with delicate\r\nstuffs, and to adorn them handsomely. From the first day of the Nauruz\r\nto the 19th degree of the Ram (Aries), which is the day of culmination,\r\nthe people gave themselves over to enjoyment and happiness. Players\r\nand singers of all bands and castes were gathered together. Dancing\r\nlulis and charmers of India whose caresses would captivate the hearts\r\nof angels kept up the excitement of the assemblies. I gave orders\r\nthat whoever might wish for intoxicating drinks and exhilarating\r\ndrugs should not be debarred from using them.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Cupbearer! brighten my cup with the light of wine;\r\n   Sing, minstrel, for the world has ordered itself as I desire.\" [103]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my father's time it had become established that one of the great\r\nnobles should prepare an entertainment on each of the 17 or 18 days\r\nof the festival, and should present His Majesty the king with choice\r\ngifts of all kinds of jewels and jewelled things, precious stuffs,\r\nand elephants and horses, and should invite him to take the trouble\r\nto come to his assembly. By way of exalting his servants, he would\r\ndeign to be present, and having looked at the presents would take\r\nwhat he approved of and bestow the remainder on the giver of the\r\nentertainment. As my mind was inclined to the comfort and ease of\r\nthe army and subjects, I this year let them off their gifts with the\r\nexception of a few from my immediate retainers, which I accepted\r\nin order to gratify them. In those same days many servants of the\r\nState obtained higher rank. Amongst them I raised Dilawar Khan Afghan\r\nto 1,500, and I raised Raja Baso, who was a landholder of the hill\r\ncountry of the Panjab, and who from the time I was prince till now\r\nhas kept the way of service and sincerity towards me and held the\r\nrank of 1,500, to 3,500. Shah Beg Khan, the governor of Qandahar,\r\nI promoted to 5,000, and Ray Ray Singh, a Rajput noble, obtained the\r\nsame rank. I gave 12,000 rupees for expenses to Rana Shankar.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of my reign, a son of that Muzaffar Gujarati who\r\nclaimed to be descended from the rulers of that country lifted up\r\nthe head of disturbance and attacked and plundered the environs of\r\nthe city of Ahmadabad. Some sardars such as Pim [104] Bahadur Uzbeg\r\nand Ray `Ali Bhati, who were amongst the distinguished and brave men\r\nthere, became martyrs in that outbreak. At length Raja Bikramajit\r\nand many mansabdars were provided by me with 6,000 or 7,000 horse,\r\nand appointed to assist the army of Gujarat. It was decided that when\r\nthings had quieted down, by the driving off of those seditious people,\r\nRaja Bikramajit should be Subahdar of Gujarat. Qilij Khan, who had\r\nbeen previously nominated to this office, should come to Court. After\r\nthe arrival of the royal troops the thread of the rebels' union was\r\nsevered; they took refuge in different jungles, and the country was\r\nreduced to order. The news of this victory reached the ear of my\r\nstate and dignity in the most acceptable of hours (New Year time).\r\n\r\nAbout this time there came a representation from my son Parwiz that\r\nthe Rana had left thana Mandal, which is about 30 [105] or 40 kos\r\nfrom Ajmir, and had run away, and that a force had been appointed to\r\npursue him; and that it was to be hoped the good fortune of Jahangir\r\nwould cause him to become non-existent.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of the feast of the New Year, many servants of\r\nthe State were honoured with favours and increase of rank. Pishrau\r\nKhan was an old retainer and had come from Persia (wilayat) with\r\nHumayun; indeed, he was one of the men whom Shah Tahmasp had sent\r\nwith Humayun. His name was Mihtar Sa`adat. As under my father he\r\nwas superintendent (darogha) and head (mihtar) of the farrash-khana\r\n(store department), and had no equal in this service, he had given\r\nhim the title of Pishrau Khan (the active Khan). Though he was a\r\nsubordinate(?) servant and had an artificer's disposition (qalaqchi\r\nmashrab), I looked to his claims of service and gave him the rank of\r\n2,000. [106]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FLIGHT OF KHUSRAU IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIRST YEAR OF MY REIGN.\r\n\r\nFutile [107] ideas had entered the mind of Khusrau in consequence\r\nof his youth and the pride youths have, and the lack of experience\r\nand the lack of foresight of worthless companions, especially at the\r\ntime of my revered father's illness. Some of these short-sighted ones,\r\nthrough the multitude of their crimes and offences, had become hopeless\r\nof pardon and indulgence, and imagined that by making Khusrau a tool\r\nthey might conduct the affairs of State through him. They overlooked\r\nthe truth that acts of sovereignty and world rule are not things to be\r\narranged by the worthless endeavours of defective intellects. The just\r\nCreator bestows them on him whom he considers fit for this glorious\r\nand exalted duty, and on such a person doth He fit the robe of honour.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"He who is seized of Fortune cannot be deprived of it;\r\n    Throne and diadem are not things of purchase;\r\n    It is not right to wrest crown and dominion\r\n    From the head which God, the Crown-cherisher, has indicated.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the futile imaginations of the seditious and short-sighted had\r\nno result but disgrace and regret, the affairs of the kingdom were\r\nconfirmed in the hands of this suppliant at the throne of Allah. I\r\ninvariably found Khusrau preoccupied and distracted. However much,\r\nin favour and affection for him, I wished to drive from his mind\r\nsome of his fears and alarms, nothing was gained until, at last,\r\nby the advice of those whose fortune was reversed, on the night of\r\nSunday, Zi-l-hijja 8th, of the year mentioned (April 6th, 1605), when\r\ntwo gharis had passed, he made a pretence [108] of going to visit the\r\ntomb of His Majesty (Akbar), and went off with 350 horsemen, who were\r\nhis adherents, from within the fort of Agra. Shortly after, one of the\r\nlamp attendants who was acquainted with the Waziru-l-mulk gave him the\r\nnews of Khusrau's flight. The Vizier took him to the Amiru-l-umara,\r\nwho, as the news seemed true, came in a distracted state of mind to\r\nthe door of the private apartments and said to one of the eunuchs,\r\n\"Take in my request and say that I have a necessary representation to\r\nmake, and let the king honour me by coming out.\" As such an affair\r\nhad not entered my thoughts I supposed that news had come from the\r\nDeccan or Gujarat. When I came out and heard what the news was,\r\nI asked, \"What must be done? Shall I mount myself, or shall I send\r\nKhurram?\" The Amiru-l-umara submitted that he would go if I ordered\r\nit. \"Let it be so,\" I said. Afterwards he said, \"If he will not turn\r\nback on my advice, and takes up arms, what must be done?\" Then I said,\r\n\"If he will go in no way on the right road, do not consider a crime\r\nanything that results from your action. Kingship regards neither son\r\nnor son-in-law. No one is a relation to a king.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I had said these words and other things, and had dismissed\r\nhim, it occurred to me that Khusrau was very much annoyed with him,\r\nand that in consequence of the dignity and nearness (to me) which\r\nhe (the Amir) enjoyed, he was an object of envy to his equals and\r\ncontemporaries. [109] Perhaps they might devise treachery and destroy\r\nhim. I therefore ordered Mu`izzu-l-mulk to recall him, and selecting\r\nin his place Shaikh Farid Bakhshi-begi commanded him to start off\r\nat once, and to take with him the mansabdars and ahadis who were\r\non guard. Ihtimam Khan the kotwal was made scout and intelligence\r\nofficer. I determined, God willing, to start off myself when it was\r\nday. Mu`izzu-l-mulk brought back the Amiru-l-umara.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, Ahmad Beg Khan and Dust Muhammad Khan had been\r\nsent off to Kabul, [110] and had got as far as Sikandra, which was\r\non Khusrau's route. On his arrival they came out of their tents with\r\nsome of their people, and returned and waited on me with the news that\r\nKhusrau had taken the Panjab road and was hastening on. It occurred\r\nto me that he might change his route and go somewhere else. As his\r\nmaternal uncle, Man Singh, was in Bengal, it occurred to many of the\r\nservants of the State that he might go in that direction. I sent out on\r\nevery side, and ascertained that he was making for the Panjab. Meantime\r\nday dawned, and in reliance on the grace and favour of God Almighty,\r\nand with clear resolve, I mounted, withheld by nothing and no one.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"In truth, he who is pursued by sorrow.\r\n    Knows not how the road is or how he may travel it.\r\n    This he knows, that horror drives him on:\r\n    He knows not with whom he goes nor whom he leaves behind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I reached the venerable mausoleum of my revered father, which\r\nis three kos from the city, I begged for aid to my courage from\r\nthe spirit of that honoured one. About this time they captured and\r\nbrought in [111] Mirza Hasan, son of Mirza Shahrukh, who had proposed\r\nto accompany Khusrau. He could not deny it when I questioned him, and I\r\nordered them to tie his hands and mount him on an elephant. [112] This\r\nwas the first good omen manifested through the kindness and blessing\r\nof that venerable one. At midday, as it had become exceedingly hot,\r\nhaving rested awhile under the shade of a tree, I said to the Khan\r\nA`zam that we, with all our composure, were in such a state that we\r\nhad not taken till now our regular allowance of opium, which it was\r\nthe practice to take the first thing in the morning, and no one had\r\nreminded us of the omission. We might imagine from this what was now\r\nthe condition of that graceless one (Khusrau). [113]\r\n\r\nMy trouble was this, that my son without any cause or reason should\r\nbecome an opponent and an enemy. If I should make no endeavour to\r\ncapture him, the fractious or rebellious would have an instrument,\r\nor else he would take his own way and go for an asylum to the Uzbegs\r\nor the Persians, and contempt would fall upon my government. On this\r\naccount, having made a special point of capturing him, I went on\r\nafter a short rest two or three kos beyond pargana Mathura, which\r\nis 20 kos from Agra, and I alighted at one of the villages of that\r\npargana where there is a tank.\r\n\r\nWhen Khusrau arrived at Mathura, he met Husain Beg Badakhshi, who\r\nwas of those who had received favours from my revered father and\r\nwas coming from Kabul to wait on me. As it is the temperament of\r\nthe Badakhshis to be seditious and turbulent, Khusrau regarded [114]\r\nthis meeting as a godsend, and made Husain Beg the captain and guide\r\nof 200 or 300 Badakhshan Aimaqs, who were with him.\r\n\r\nAnyone whom they met, they plundered of horses and goods. Merchants and\r\nconveyers of goods were plundered by these rascals, and wheresoever\r\nthey went men's wives and children were not safe from the calamity\r\nof these wretches. With his own eyes Khusrau was witnessing the\r\noppression practised in the hereditary dominions of his ancestors,\r\nand after being a witness of the improper deeds of these rascals he\r\na thousand times every moment wished death for himself. Finally, he\r\nhad no remedy but to temporize with and support those dogs. If good\r\nluck and fortune had assisted him in his affairs, he would have made\r\nrepentance and regret his voucher, and come without any deceit to\r\nwait on me. God, who knows the world of secrets, knows that I should\r\nhave passed over his offences entirely and shown him such favour\r\nand affection that to the extent of a hair's point no estrangement\r\nor fear would have remained upon his mind. Inasmuch as during the\r\nlifetime of the late king (Akbar) an intention of joining in the\r\nsedition of some of the rebels had manifested itself in his mind, and\r\nhe knew that this had come to my knowledge, he placed no reliance on\r\nmy kindness and affection. His mother, while I was prince, in grief at\r\nhis ways and behaviour and the misconduct of her brother Madho Singh,\r\n[115] killed herself by swallowing opium (tiryaq). [116] What shall I\r\nwrite of her excellences and goodness? She had perfect intelligence,\r\nand her devotion to me was such that she would have sacrificed a\r\nthousand sons and brothers for one hair of mine. She constantly wrote\r\nto Khusrau and urged him to be sincere and affectionate to me. When\r\nshe saw that it was of no use and that it was unknown how far he\r\nwould be led away, she from the indignation and high spirit which are\r\ninherent in the Rajput character determined upon death. Her mind was\r\nseveral times disturbed, for such feelings were hereditary, and her\r\nancestors and her brothers had occasionally showed signs of madness,\r\nbut after a time had recovered. At a time when I had gone hunting,\r\non Zi-l-hijja 26th, 1013 [117] (May 6th, 1605), she in her agitation\r\nswallowed a quantity of opium, and quickly passed away. It was as if\r\nshe had foreseen this behaviour of her unworthy son.\r\n\r\nMy first marriage and that at the commencement of my adolescence\r\nwas with her. After Khusrau's birth I gave her the title of Shah\r\nBegam. When she could not endure the bad conduct of her son and\r\nbrother towards me she became disgusted with life and died, thereby\r\nescaping the present grief and sorrow. In consequence of her death,\r\nfrom the attachment I had for her, I passed some days without any kind\r\nof pleasure in life or existence, and for four days, which amount\r\nto 32 watches, I took nothing in the shape of food or drink. When\r\nthis tale was told to my revered father, a letter of condolence of\r\nexcessive kindness and affection reached this devoted disciple, and\r\nhe sent me a robe of honour and the auspicious turban tied just as\r\nhe had taken it off his head. This favour threw water on the flame\r\nof my grief and afforded complete quiet and repose to my unquietude\r\nand disturbance. My intention in relating these circumstances is to\r\npoint out that no evil fortune is greater than when a son, through the\r\nimpropriety of his conduct and his unapproved methods of behaviour,\r\ncauses the death of his mother and becomes contumacious and rebellious\r\nto his father, without cause or reason, but simply through his own\r\nimaginations and futile ideas, and chooses to avoid the blessing\r\nof waiting upon him. Inasmuch as the Almighty Avenger lays a proper\r\npunishment on each action, of necessity his condition finally came to\r\nthis, that he was caught under the worst circumstances, and falling\r\nfrom a position of trust became captive to perpetual incarceration.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"When the man of sense behaves as if drunk,\r\n    He puts his foot in a snare, his head in a noose.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTo sum up, on Tuesday, Zi-l-hijja 10th, I alighted at the station\r\nof Hodal. [118] Shaikh Farid Bakhshi and a band of valiant men were\r\nchosen to pursue Khusrau and became the vanguard of the victorious\r\narmy. I sent back Dust Muhammad, who was in attendance on me,\r\non account of his previous service and his white beard, to take\r\ncharge of the fort of Agra and of the zanana and the treasuries. When\r\nleaving Agra, I had placed the city in the charge of I`timadu-d-daula\r\nand Waziru-l-mulk. I now said to Dust Muhammad, \"As we are going to\r\nthe Panjab, and that province is in the diwani of I`timadu-d-daula,\r\nyou will despatch him to us, and will imprison and keep watch over\r\nthe sons [119] of Mirza Muhammad Hakim who are in Agra; as when such\r\nproceedings manifest themselves in the son of one's loins what may one\r\nexpect from nephews and cousins?\" After the dispatch of Dust Muhammad,\r\nMu`izzu-l-mulk became bakhshi.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday I alighted at Palwal, and on Thursday at Faridabad;\r\non Friday, the 13th, I reached Delhi. From the dust of the road\r\n(i.e. immediately) I hastened to the venerated tomb of Humayun, and\r\nthere besought help in my purpose, and with my own hand distributed\r\nmoney to poor persons and dervishes. Thence turning to the shrine\r\nof the venerable saint Shaikh Nizamu-d-din Auliya, I performed the\r\ndues of pilgrimage. After this I gave a portion [120] of money to\r\nJamalu-d-din Husain Anju and another portion to Hakim Muzaffar that\r\nthey might divide it amongst the poor and dervishes. On Saturday\r\nthe 14th I stayed in Saray Narela. [121] This rest-house (saray)\r\nKhusrau had burned as he went.\r\n\r\nThe rank of Aqa Mulla, brother of Asaf Khan, who had been exalted by\r\nbecoming my servant, was fixed in original and increase at 1,000 with\r\n300 horse. He was in close attendance during this journey. Considering\r\nthat some of the Aimaqs attached to the royal army were in league\r\nwith Khusrau, and fearing that consequently some fraud or sedition\r\nmight enter their minds, 2,000 rupees were given to their leaders to\r\ndistribute amongst their men and make them hopeful of the Jahangiri\r\nfavour. I gave money to Shaikh Fazlu-llah and Raja Dhirdhar to\r\ndistribute to faqirs and brahmans on the road. I gave orders that\r\nto Rana Shankar in Ajmir should be given 30,000 rupees by way of\r\nassistance for his expenditure.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 16th, I reached the pargana of Panipat. [122] This\r\nstation and place used to be very propitious to my gracious father\r\nand honoured ancestors, and two great victories had been gained in\r\nit. One was the defeat of Ibrahim Lodi, which was won by the might of\r\nthe victorious hosts of His Majesty Firdus-makani. The story of this\r\nhas been written in the histories of the time. The second victory was\r\nover the wicked Hemu, and was manifested from the world of fortune in\r\nthe beginning of the reign of my revered father, as has been described\r\nby me in detail.\r\n\r\nAt the time that Khusrau had left Delhi and was proceeding to Panipat,\r\nit happened that Dilawar Khan had arrived there. When shortly before\r\nKhusrau's arrival he heard of this affair, he sent his children across\r\nthe Jumna and bravely determined to hasten on and throw himself into\r\nthe fort of Lahore before Khusrau should arrive. About this time\r\n`Abdu-r-Rahim also reached Panipat from Lahore, and Dilawar Khan\r\nsuggested to him that he too should send his children across the\r\nriver, and should stand aside and await the victorious standards of\r\nJahangir. As he was lethargic and timid, he could not make up his mind\r\nto do this, and delayed so much that Khusrau arrived. He went out and\r\nwaited on him, and either voluntarily or in a state of agitation agreed\r\nto accompany him. He obtained the title of Malik Anwar and the position\r\nof vizier. Dilawar Khan, like a brave man, turned towards Lahore,\r\nand on his road informed everyone and everybody of the servants of\r\nthe court and the karoriyan, and the merchants whom he came across,\r\nof the exodus of Khusrau. Some he took with him, and others he told\r\nto stand aside out of the way. After that, the servants of God were\r\nrelieved of the plundering by robbers and oppressors. Most probably,\r\nif Sayyid Kamal in Delhi, and Dilawar Khan at Panipat, had shown\r\ncourage and determination, and had blocked Khusrau's path, his\r\ndisorderly force would not have been able to resist and would have\r\nscattered, and he himself would have been captured. The fact is that\r\ntheir talents (himmat) were not equal to this, but afterwards each\r\nmade amends for his fault, viz., Dilawar Khan, by his rapid march,\r\nentered the fort of Lahore before Khusrau reached it, and by this\r\nnotable service made amends for his earlier shortcoming, and Sayyid\r\nKamal manfully exerted himself in the engagement with Khusrau, as\r\nwill be described in its own place.\r\n\r\nOn Zi-l-hijja 17th the royal standards were set up in the pargana of\r\nKarnal. Here I raised `Abidin Khwaja, son of Khwaja Kalan Juybari and\r\npirzada (spiritual adviser), son of `Abdu-llah Khan Uzbeg, who had\r\ncome in the time of my revered father, to the rank of 1,000. Shaikh\r\nNizam Thaneswari, who was one of the notorious impostors (shayyadan)\r\nof the age, waited on Khusrau, and having gratified him with pleasant\r\nnews, again [123] led him out of the (right) path, and then came to\r\nwait on me. As I had heard of these transactions, I gave him his road\r\nexpenses and told him to depart for the auspicious place of pilgrimage\r\n(Mecca). On the 19th the halt was in pargana Shahabad. Here there was\r\nvery little water, but it happened that heavy rain fell, so that all\r\nwere rejoiced.\r\n\r\nI promoted Shaikh Ahmad Lahori, who from my princehood had filled\r\nthe relationship of service and discipleship and the position of\r\na house-born one (khanazada) to the office of Mir-i-`Adl (Chief\r\nJustice). Disciples [124] and sincere followers were presented on his\r\nintroduction, and to each it was necessary to give the token [125] and\r\nthe likeness (shast u shabah). They were given on his recommendation\r\n(?). At the time of initiation some words of advice were given to\r\nthe disciple: he must not confuse or darken his years with sectarian\r\nquarrels, but must follow the rule of universal peace with regard to\r\nreligions; he must not kill any living creature with his own hand,\r\nand must not flay anything. The only exceptions are in battle and\r\nthe chase.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Be not the practiser of making lifeless any living thing.\r\n    Save in the battlefield or in the time of hunting.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHonour the luminaries (the Sun, Moon, etc.), which are manifesters of\r\nGod's light, according to the degree of each, and recognize the power\r\nand existence of Almighty God at all times and seasons. Be careful\r\nindeed that whether in private or in public you never for a moment\r\nforget Him.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Lame or low [126] or crooked or unrefined,\r\n    Be amorous of Him and seek after Him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMy revered father became possessed of these principles, and was rarely\r\nvoid of such thoughts.\r\n\r\nAt the stage of Aluwa(?) [127] I appointed Abu-n-nabi(?) [128] Uzbeg\r\nwith fifty-seven other mansabdars to assist Shaikh Farid, and gave\r\nthe force 40,000 rupees for its expenses. To Jamil Beg were given\r\n7,000 rupees to divide among the Aimaqs (cavalry). I also presented\r\nMir Sharif Amuli [129] with 2,000 rupees.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday the 24th of the same month they captured five of the\r\nattendants and comrades of Khusrau. Two of these, who confessed to\r\nhis service, I ordered to be thrown under the feet of elephants,\r\nand three who denied were placed in custody that enquiry might be\r\nmade. On Farwardin 12th of the first year of my reign, Mirza Husain\r\nand Nuru-d-din Quli the kotwal entered Lahore, and on the 24th of\r\nthe same month a messenger of Dilawar Khan arrived (there) with news\r\nthat Khusrau was moving on Lahore and that they should be on their\r\nguard. On the same day the city gates were guarded and strengthened,\r\nand two days later Dilawar Khan entered the fort with a few men and\r\nbegan to strengthen the towers and walls. Wherever these were broken\r\nand thrown down he repaired them, and, placing cannon and swivel guns\r\non the citadel, he prepared for battle. Assembling the small number\r\nof the royal servants who were in the fort, they were assigned their\r\nseveral duties, and the people of the city also with loyalty gave their\r\nassistance. Two days later, and when all was ready, Khusrau arrived,\r\nand, having fixed a place for his camp, gave orders to invest [130]\r\nthe city and to prepare for battle, and to burn one of the gates on\r\nany side where one could be got at. \"After taking the fort,\" he said\r\nto his wicked crew, \"I will give orders to plunder the city for seven\r\ndays and to make captive the women and children.\"\r\n\r\nThis doomed lot set fire to a gate, and Dilawar Beg Khan, Husain Beg\r\nthe diwan, and Nuru-d-din Quli the kotwal built a wall inside opposite\r\nthe gateway.\r\n\r\nMeantime Sa`id Khan, who was one of those appointed to Kashmir and was\r\nnow encamped on the Chenab, having heard the news, started rapidly for\r\nLahore. When he reached the Ravi he sent word to the garrison of the\r\nfort that he came with a loyal intention and that they should admit\r\nhim. They sent someone at night and conducted him and some of his\r\nmen inside. When the siege had lasted nine days, news of the approach\r\nof the royal army came repeatedly to Khusrau and his adherents. They\r\nbecame helpless (bi pa), and made up their minds that they must face\r\nthe victorious army.\r\n\r\nAs Lahore is one of the greatest places in Hindustan, a great number of\r\npeople gathered in six or seven days. It was reported on good authority\r\nthat 10,000 or 12,000 horse were collected, and had left the city with\r\nthe view of making a night attack on the royal vanguard. This news\r\nwas brought to me at the saray of Qazi `Ali on the night of Thursday\r\nthe 16th. Although it rained heavily in the night I beat the drum of\r\nmarch and mounted. Arriving in Sultanpur at dawn I remained there till\r\nnoon. By chance, at this place and hour the victorious army encountered\r\nthat ill-fated band. Mu`izzu-l-mulk had brought a dish of roast meat,\r\n[131] and I was turning towards it with zest when the news of the\r\nbattle was brought to me. Though I had a longing to eat the roast\r\nmeat, I immediately took a mouthful by way of augury and mounted,\r\nand without waiting for the coming up of men and without regard to\r\nthe smallness of my force I went off in all haste. However much I\r\ndemanded my chiltah (wadded coat), they did not produce it. My only\r\narms were a spear and sword, but I committed myself to the favour of\r\nGod and started off without hesitation. At first my escort did not\r\nnumber more than fifty horsemen; no one had expected a fight that\r\nday. In fine, when I reached the head of the bridge of Gobindwal,\r\n[132] 400 or 500 horse, good and bad, had come together. When I\r\nhad crossed the bridge the news of a victory was brought to me. The\r\nbearer of the good news was Shamsi, tushakchi (wardrobe man), and\r\nfor his good news he obtained the title of Khush-khabar Khan. Mir\r\nJamalu-d-din Husain, whom I had sent previously to advise Khusrau,\r\ncame up at the same time and said such things about the number and\r\nbravery of Khusrau's men as frightened his hearers. Though news\r\nof the victory came continuously, this simple-minded Sayyid would\r\nnot believe it, and expressed incredulity that such an army as he\r\nhad seen could be defeated by Shaikh Farid's force, which was small\r\nand not properly equipped. When they brought Khusrau's litter [133]\r\nwith two of his eunuchs, the Mir admitted what had happened. Then,\r\nalighting from his horse, he placed his head at my feet and professed\r\nevery kind of humility and submission, and said that there could be\r\nno higher or more lofty fortune than this.\r\n\r\nIn this command Shaikh Farid behaved with sincerity and devotion. The\r\nSayyids of Barha, who are of the brave ones of the age, and who\r\nhave held this place in every fight in which they have been, formed\r\nthe van. Saif Khan, son of Sayyid Mahmud Khan Barha, the head\r\nof the tribe, had shown great bravery and had received seventeen\r\nwounds. Sayyid Jalal, also of the brethren of this band, received an\r\narrow in his temple and died a few days later. At the time when the\r\nSayyids of Barha, who were not more than fifty or sixty in number,\r\nhaving received wounds from 1,500 Badakhshi horsemen, had been cut\r\nto pieces, Sayyid Kamal, who, with his brothers, had been appointed\r\nto support the van, came up on the flank and fought with wondrous\r\nbravery and manliness. After that the men of the right wing raised\r\nthe cry of Padshah salamat (\"Long live the King\") and charged,\r\nand the rebels hearing the words, gave up and scattered abroad to\r\nvarious hiding-places. About 400 Aimaqs became crushed on the plain\r\nof anger and overcome by the victorious army. Khusrau's box of jewels\r\nand precious things which he had always with him, fell into our hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"Who thought that this boy of few years\r\n        Would behave so badly to his sire?\r\n        At the first taste of the cup he brings up the lees.\r\n        He melts away my glory and his own modesty.\r\n        He sets on fire [134] the throne of Khurshid,\r\n        He longs for the place of Jamshid.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nShort-sighted men in Allahabad had urged me also to rebel against my\r\nfather. Their words were extremely unacceptable and disapproved by\r\nme. I know what sort of endurance a kingdom would have, the foundations\r\nof which were laid on hostility to a father, and was not moved by\r\nthe evil counsels of such worthless men, but acting according to the\r\ndictates of reason and knowledge I waited on my father, my guide,\r\nmy qibla, [135] and my visible God, and as a result of this good\r\npurpose it went well with me.\r\n\r\nIn the evening of the day of Khusrau's flight I gave Raja Baso, who\r\nis a trusty zamindar of the hill-country of Lahore, leave to go to\r\nthat frontier, and, wherever he heard news or trace of Khusrau, to\r\nmake every effort to capture him. I also appointed Mahabat Khan and\r\nMirza `Ali Akbarshahi to a large force, which was to pursue Khusrau\r\nin whatever direction he might go. I resolved with myself that if\r\nKhusrau went to Kabul, I would follow him and not turn back till he\r\nwas captured. If not delaying in Kabul he should go on to Badakhshan\r\nand those regions, I would leave Mahabat Khan in Kabul and return\r\nmyself (to India). My reason for not going to Badakhshan was that that\r\nwretch would (in that case) certainly ally himself with the Uzbegs,\r\nand the disgrace would attach to this State.\r\n\r\nOn the day on which the royal troops were ordered to pursue Khusrau,\r\n15,000 rupees were given to Mahabat Khan and 20,000 to the ahadis,\r\nand 10,000 more were sent with the army to be given to whom it might\r\nbe necessary to give it on the way.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, the 28th, the victorious camp was pitched at Jaipal,\r\n[136] which lies seven kos from Lahore. On the same day Khusrau\r\narrived with a few men on the bank of the Chenab. The brief account\r\nof what had happened is that after his defeat those who had escaped\r\nwith him from the battle became divided in opinion. The Afghans and\r\nIndians, who were mostly his old retainers, wished to double back\r\nlike foxes into Hindustan, and to become a source of rebellion and\r\ntrouble there. Husain Beg, whose people and family and treasure were\r\nin the direction of Kabul, suggested going to Kabul. In the end, as\r\naction was taken according to the wish of Husain Beg, the Hindustanis\r\nand the Afghans decided to separate themselves from him. On arriving\r\nat the Chenab, he proposed to cross at the ferry of Shahpur, which\r\nis one of the recognized crossings, but as he could find no boats\r\nthere he made for the ferry of Sodharah, where his people got one\r\nboat without boatmen and another full of firewood and grass.\r\n\r\nThe ferries over the rivers had been stopped because before\r\nKhusrau's defeat orders had been given to all the jagirdars and the\r\nsuperintendents of roads and crossings in the subah of the Panjab\r\nthat as this kind of dispute had arisen they must all be on the\r\nalert. Husain Beg wished to transfer the men from the boat with\r\nfirewood and grass to the other, so that they might convey Khusrau\r\nacross. At this juncture arrived Kilan, [137] son-in-law of Kamal\r\nChaudhari of Sodharah, and saw a body of men about to cross in the\r\nnight. He cried out to the boatmen that there was an order from the\r\nking Jahangir forbidding unknown men from crossing in the night,\r\nand that they must be careful. Owing to the noise and uproar,\r\nthe people of the neighbourhood gathered together, and Kamal's\r\nson-in-law took from the boatmen the pole with which they propel the\r\nboat, and which in Hindustani is called balli, and thus made the boat\r\nunmanageable. Although money was offered to the boatmen, not one would\r\nferry them over. News went to Abu-l-Qasim Namakin, who was at Gujarat,\r\nnear the Chenab, that a body of men were wanting to cross the river\r\nby night, and he at once came to the ferry in the night with his\r\nsons and some horsemen. Things went to such a length that Husain Beg\r\nshot arrows at the boatmen, [138] and Kamal's son-in-law also took to\r\nshooting arrows from the river-bank. For four kos the boat took its\r\nown way down the river, until at the end of the night it grounded,\r\nand try as they would they could not get it off. Meantime it became\r\nday. Abu-l-Qasim and Khwaja Khizr Khan, who by the efforts of Hilal\r\nKhan had assembled on this (? the west) side of the river, fortified\r\nits west bank, and the zamindars fortified it on the east.\r\n\r\nBefore this affair of Khusrau's, I had sent Hilal Khan as sazawal\r\nto the army appointed for Kashmir under Sa`id Khan, and by chance\r\nhe arrived in the neighbourhood (of the ferry) that same night;\r\nhe came in the nick of time, and his efforts had great effect in\r\nbringing together Abu-l-Qasim Khan Namakin, and Khwaja Khizr Khan in\r\nthe capture of Khusrau.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of Sunday, the 24th of the aforesaid month, people on\r\nelephants and in boats captured Khusrau, and on Monday, the last day\r\nof the month, news of this reached me in the garden of Mirza Kamran. I\r\nimmediately ordered the Amiru-l-umara to go to Gujarat and to bring\r\nKhusrau to wait on me.\r\n\r\nIn counsels on State affairs and government it often happens that I\r\nact according to my own judgment and prefer my own counsel to that\r\nof others. In the first instance I had elected to wait on my revered\r\nfather from Allahabad in opposition to the advice of my faithful\r\nservants, and I obtained the blessing of serving him, and this was\r\nfor my spiritual and temporal good. By the same course of conduct I\r\nhad become king. The second instance was the pursuit of Khusrau, from\r\nwhich I was not held back by taking time to ascertain the (auspicious)\r\nhour, etc., and from which I took no rest until I captured him. It\r\nis a strange thing that after I had started I asked Hakim `Ali, who\r\nis learned in mathematics, how the hour of my departure had been\r\n(i.e. whether propitious or not), and he replied that in order to\r\nobtain my object if I had wished to select an hour, there could not\r\nhave been for years one selected better than that in which I mounted.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, Muharram 3rd, 1015, in Mirza Kamran's garden, they brought\r\nKhusrau before me with his hands tied and chains on his legs from the\r\nleft side [139] after the manner and custom of Chingiz Khan. They\r\nmade Husain Beg stand on his right hand and `Abdu-r-Rahim on his\r\nleft. Khusrau stood weeping and trembling between them. Husain Beg,\r\nwith the idea that it might profit him, began to speak wildly. When\r\nhis purport became apparent to me I did not allow him to continue\r\ntalking, but handed over Khusrau in chains, and ordered these two\r\nvillains to be put in the skins of an ox and an ass, and that they\r\nshould be mounted on asses with their faces to the tail [140] and\r\nthus taken round the city. As the ox-hide dried more quickly than\r\nthat of the ass, Husain Beg remained alive for four watches and died\r\nfrom suffocation. `Abdu-r-Rahim, who was in the ass's skin and to\r\nwhom they gave some refreshment from outside, remained alive.\r\n\r\nFrom Monday, the last day of Zi-l-hijja, until the 9th of Muharram\r\nof the aforesaid year, I remained in Mirza Kamran's garden because\r\nthe time was unpropitious. [141] I bestowed Bhairawal, [142] where\r\nthe battle had taken place, on Shaikh Farid, and rewarded him with\r\nthe high title of Murtaza Khan. For the sake of good government I\r\nordered posts to be set up on both sides of the road from the garden\r\nto the city, and ordered them to hang up and impale the seditious\r\nAimaqs and others who had taken part in the rebellion. Thus each one\r\nof them received an extraordinary punishment. I gave headship to those\r\nlandholders who had shown loyalty, and to every one of the Chaudharis\r\nbetween the Jhelam and the Chenab I gave lands for their support.\r\n\r\nOf Husain Beg's property there were obtained from the house of Mir\r\nMuhammad Baqi nearly seven lakhs of rupees. This was exclusive of what\r\nhe had made over to other places and of what he had with him. After\r\nthis, whenever his name is mentioned, the words [143] gawan u kharan\r\n(bullocks and asses) will be used. When he came to this Court in\r\ncompany with Mirza Shahrukh he had one horse. By degrees his affairs\r\nflourished so that he became possessed of treasure both visible and\r\nburied, and projects of this kind entered his mind.\r\n\r\nWhile Khusrau's affair was still in the will of God, as there was no\r\nactual governor between Afghanistan and Agra, which is a source of\r\nsedition and mischief, and, fearing that Khusrau's affair might be\r\nprolonged, I ordered my son Parwiz to leave some of the sardars to\r\nlook after the Rana and to come to Agra with Asaf Khan and a body of\r\nthose nearly connected with him in the service. He was to consider\r\nthe protection and management of that region his special charge. But\r\nby the blessed favour of Allah, Khusrau's affair was settled before\r\nParwiz arrived in Agra; I accordingly ordered my aforesaid son to\r\ncome and wait on me.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, Muharram 8th, I auspiciously entered the fort of\r\nLahore. A number of loyalists represented to me that my return to\r\nAgra would be for the good of the State at this time when much was\r\ngoing amiss in Gujarat, in the Deccan, and in Bengal. This counsel\r\ndid not meet with my approval, for the reports of Shah Beg Khan, the\r\ngovernor of Qandahar, showed that the officers of the Persian border\r\nwere meditating an attack on that fortress. They had been moved thereto\r\nby the machinations of the residuum of the Mirzas of Qandahar's army,\r\nwhich was always shaking the chain of contention. The Persian officers\r\nhad written letters to these malcontents, and there was likelihood of\r\na disturbance. It occurred to me that the death of His Majesty Akbar\r\nand the unreasonable outbreak of Khusrau might put an edge on their\r\ndesign, and that they might attack Qandahar. What had occurred to\r\nmy mind became a realized fact. The governor of Farah, the Malik of\r\nSistan, and the jagirdars of that neighbourhood, with the assistance\r\nof Husain Khan, the governor of Herat, invaded Qandahar. Praise is\r\ndue to the manliness and courage of Shah Beg Khan, who planted his\r\nfoot firmly like a man, and strengthened the fort, and seated himself\r\non the top of the third(?) citadel of the aforesaid fort in such a\r\nmanner that outsiders could see his entertainments. During the siege\r\nhe girded not his loins, but with bare head and feet arranged parties\r\nof pleasure; yet no day passed that he did not send a force from the\r\nfort to meet the foe and did not make manly efforts. This went on as\r\nlong as he was in the fort. The Qizilbash army had invested on three\r\nsides. When news of this reached Lahore it was clearly advisable to\r\nremain in that neighbourhood. A large force was immediately appointed\r\nunder the leadership of Mirza Ghazi, who was accompanied by a number of\r\nmen of rank and servants of the Court, such as Qara Beg and Tukhta Beg,\r\nwho had been promoted with the titles of Qara Khan and Sardar Khan. I\r\nappointed Mirza Ghazi to a mansab of 5,000 personal, and horsemen,\r\nand bestowed drums on him. Mirza Ghazi was the son of Mirza Jani\r\nTarkhan, king of Thathah (Sind), and by the efforts of `Abdu-r-Rahim\r\nKhankhanan that country had been conquered in the reign of the late\r\nking. The country of Thathah was included in his jagir, and he held\r\nthe rank with personality and horsemen of 5,000. After his death his\r\nson Mirza Ghazi was raised to his rank and service. Their ancestors\r\nwere among the amirs of Sultan Husain Mirza Bay-qara, the ruler of\r\nKhurasan, and they were originally descended from the amirs of Timur\r\n(Sahib-qirani). Khwaja `Aqil was appointed bakhshi of this army; 43,000\r\nrupees were given to Qara Khan for road expenses, and 15,000 to Naqdi\r\nBeg and Qilij Beg, who were to accompany Mirza Ghazi. I determined to\r\nstay at Lahore in order to settle this matter and with the intention\r\nof a tour to Kabul. About this time the rank of Hakim Fathu-llah was\r\nfixed, original and increased, at 1,000 personality and 300 horse. As\r\nShaikh Husain Jami had had dreams about me which had come true, I\r\ngave him twenty lakhs of dams, equivalent to 30,000 or 40,000 rupees,\r\nfor the expenses of himself and his monastery and the dervishes who\r\nwere with him. On the 22nd I promoted `Abdu-llah Khan to the rank of\r\n2,500 personal and 500 horse, original and increased. I ordered to\r\nbe given to the ahadis two lakhs of rupees to be paid in advance and\r\ndeducted by degrees from their monthly pay. I bestowed 6,000 rupees\r\non Qasim Beg Khan, the son-in-law of Shah Beg Khan, and 3,000 rupees\r\non Sayyid Bahadur Khan.\r\n\r\nIn Gobindwal, which is on the river Biyah (Beas), there was a Hindu\r\nnamed Arjun, [144] in the garments of sainthood and sanctity, so much\r\nso that he had captured many of the simple-hearted of the Hindus, and\r\neven of the ignorant and foolish followers of Islam, by his ways and\r\nmanners, and they had loudly sounded the drum of his holiness. They\r\ncalled him Guru, and from all sides stupid people crowded to worship\r\nand manifest complete faith in him. For three or four generations\r\n(of spiritual successors) they had kept this shop warm. Many times\r\nit occurred to me to put a stop to this vain affair or to bring him\r\ninto the assembly of the people of Islam.\r\n\r\nAt last when Khusrau passed along this road this insignificant fellow\r\nproposed to wait upon him. Khusrau happened to halt at the place where\r\nhe was, and he came out and did homage to him. He behaved to Khusrau\r\nin certain special ways, and made on his forehead a finger-mark\r\nin saffron, which the Indians (Hinduwan) call qashqa, [145] and\r\nis considered propitious. When this came to my ears and I clearly\r\nunderstood his folly, I ordered them to produce him and handed over\r\nhis houses, dwelling-places, and children to Murtaza Khan, and having\r\nconfiscated his property commanded that he should be put to death.\r\n\r\nThere were two men named Raju and Amba, who, under the shadow of\r\nthe protection of the eunuch Daulat Khan, made their livelihood by\r\noppression and tyranny, and had done many acts of oppression in the\r\nfew days that Khusrau was before Lahore. I ordered Raju to the gallows\r\nand a fine to be taken from Amba, who was reputed to be wealthy. In\r\nshort, 15,000 rupees were collected from him, which sum I ordered\r\nthem to expend on bulghur-khanas (refectories) and in charity.\r\n\r\nSa`du-llah Khan, son of Sa`d Khan, was promoted to the rank of 2,000\r\npersonal and 1,000 horse.\r\n\r\nIn his great desire to wait upon me, Parwiz traversed long distances in\r\na short time, in the rainy season and incessant rain, and on Thursday,\r\nthe 29th, when two watches and three ghari of day had passed, obtained\r\nthe blessing of seeing me. With exceeding kindness and affection,\r\nI took him into the embrace of favour and kissed his forehead.\r\n\r\nWhen this disgraceful conduct showed itself in Khusrau, I had\r\nresolved not to delay in any place till I had captured him. There\r\nwas a probability that he might turn back towards Hindustan, so\r\nit appeared impolitic to leave Agra empty, as it was the centre\r\nof the State, the abode of the ladies of the holy harem, and the\r\ndepository of the world's treasures. On these accounts I had written\r\nwhen leaving Agra to Parwiz, saying that his loyalty had had this\r\nresult, that Khusrau had fled and that Fortune had turned her face\r\ntoward himself; that I had started in pursuit of Khusrau, and that he\r\nshould consequently dispose of the affairs of the Rana in some way\r\naccording to the necessity of the time, and for the benefit of the\r\nkingdom should himself come quickly to Agra. I had delivered into\r\nhis charge the capital and treasury, which was equal to the wealth\r\nof Qarun, [146] and I had commended him to the God of power. Before\r\nthis letter reached Parwiz, the Rana had been so humbled that he\r\nhad sent to Asaf Khan to say that as by his own acts he had come\r\nto shame and disgrace, he hoped that he would intercede for him in\r\nsuch a way that the prince would be content with his sending Bagha,\r\n[147] who was one of his sons. Parwiz had not agreed to this, and\r\nsaid that either the Rana himself should come or that he should send\r\nKaran. Meantime the news of Khusrau's disturbance arrived, and on its\r\naccount Asaf Khan and other loyalists agreed to the coming of Bagha,\r\nwho obtained the blessing of waiting on the prince near Mandalgarh.\r\n\r\nParwiz, leaving Raja Jagannath and most of the chiefs of his army,\r\nstarted for Agra with Asaf Khan and some of those near to him and\r\nhis own attendants, and with him brought Bagha to the Court. When\r\nhe came near Agra he heard the news of the victory over Khusrau and\r\nhis capture, and after resting two days an order reached him that\r\nas matters appeared settled in all quarters he should betake himself\r\nto me, in order that on the prescribed date he might obtain the good\r\nfortune of waiting on me. I bestowed on him the parasol (aftab-gir),\r\n[148] which is one of the signs of royalty, and I gave him the rank\r\nof 10,000 and sent an order to the officials to grant him a tankhwah\r\njagir. At this time I sent Mirza `Ali Beg to Kashmir; 10,000 rupees\r\nwere delivered to Qazi `Izzatu-llah to divide amongst faqirs and\r\nthe poor of Kabul. Ahmad Beg Khan was promoted to the rank of 2,000\r\npersonal and 1,250 horse, original and extra. At the same time Muqarrab\r\nKhan, who had been sent to Burhanpur to bring the children of Daniyal,\r\nreturned after an absence of 6 months 22 days and had the honour of\r\nan audience, and related in detail what had occurred in those regions.\r\n\r\nSaif Khan was promoted to the rank of 2,000 personal and 1,000\r\nhorse. Shaikh `Abdu-l-Wahhab [149] of the Bukhara sayyids, who was\r\ngovernor of Delhi under the late king, was dismissed from the post\r\n(by me) for certain ill-deeds done by his men, and was entered amongst\r\nthe holders of subsistence lands and the arbab-i-sa`adat.\r\n\r\nIn the whole of the hereditary dominions, both the crown lands\r\nand the jagirs, I ordered the preparation of bulghur-khanas (free\r\neating-houses), where cooked food might be provided for the poor\r\naccording to their condition, and so that residents and travellers\r\nboth might reap the benefit.\r\n\r\nAmba [150] Khan Kashmiri, who was of the stock of the rulers\r\nof Kashmir, was selected for the rank of 1,000 personal and 300\r\nhorse. On Monday, Rabi`u-l-akhir 9th, I gave Parwiz a special sword;\r\nand jewelled swords were presented also to Qutbu-d-din Khan Koka and\r\nthe Amiru-l-umara. I saw Daniyal's children, whom Muqarrab Khan had\r\nbrought; there were three sons and four daughters. The boys bore\r\nthe names Tahmuras, [151] Baysunghar, and Hushang. Such kindness\r\nand affection were shown by me to these children as no one thought\r\npossible. I resolved that Tahmuras, who was the eldest, should always\r\nbe in waiting on me, and the others were handed over to the charge\r\nof my own sisters.\r\n\r\nA special dress of honour was sent to Raja Man Singh in Bengal. I\r\nordered a reward of 30 lakhs of dams to Mirza Ghazi. I bestowed\r\non Shaikh Ibrahim, son of Qutbu-d-din Khan Koka, the rank of 1,000\r\npersonal and 300 horse, and dignified him with the title of Kishwar\r\nKhan.\r\n\r\nAs when I started in pursuit of Khusrau I had left my son Khurram in\r\ncharge of the palaces and treasury, I now, when that affair had been\r\nsettled, ordered the said son to attend upon Hazrat Maryam-zamani\r\nand the other ladies, and to escort them to me. When they reached the\r\nneighbourhood of Lahore, on Friday the 12th of the month mentioned,\r\nI embarked in a boat and went to a village named Dahr to meet my\r\nmother, and I had the good fortune to be received by her. After the\r\nperformance of obeisance and prostration and greeting which is due\r\nfrom the young to the old according to the custom of Chingiz, the rules\r\nof Timur and common usage, and after worship of the King of the World\r\n(God), and after finishing this business, I obtained leave to return,\r\nand re-entered the fort of Lahore.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th, having appointed Mu`izzu-l-mulk bakhshi of the army\r\nagainst the Rana, I dismissed him to it. As news had come of the\r\nrebellion of Ray Ray Singh and his son, Dulip, in the neighbourhood of\r\nNagor, I ordered Raja Jagannath to proceed against them with others\r\nof the servants of the State and Mu`izzu-l-mulk, and to put a stop\r\nto this disturbance. I gave 50,000 rupees to Sardar Khan, who had\r\nbeen appointed to the place of Shah Beg Khan as Governor of Qandahar,\r\nand I promoted him to the rank of 3,000 personal and 2,500 horse. To\r\nKhizr Khan, the late ruler of Khandesh, were given 3,000 rupees, and\r\nto his brother, Ahmad Khan, [152] who is one of the khanazadas of the\r\nState. Hashim Khan, son of Qasim Khan, who is one of the house-born of\r\nthe State, and worthy of advancement, I promoted to the rank of 2,500\r\npersonal and 1,500 horse. I gave him also one of my own horses. I sent\r\nrobes of honour to eight individuals amongst the nobles of the army of\r\nthe Deccan. [153] Five thousand rupees were given to Nizam of Shiraz,\r\nthe story-teller. Three thousand rupees were given for the expenses\r\nof the bulghur-khana of Kashmir to the wakil of Mirza `Ali Beg, the\r\ngovernor of that place, to send to Srinagar. I presented a jewelled\r\ndagger of the value of 6,000 rupees to Qutbu-d-din Khan.\r\n\r\nNews reached me that Shaikh Ibrahim Baba, the Afghan, had opened\r\na religious establishment (lit. one of being a shaikh and having\r\ndisciples) in one of the parganas [154] of Lahore, and as his doings\r\nwere disreputable and foolish a considerable number of Afghans had\r\ncollected round him. I ordered him to be brought and handed over to\r\nParwiz to be kept in the fort of Chunar; so this vain disturbance\r\nwas put an end to.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, 7th Jumada-l-awwal, many of the mansabdars and ahadis\r\nwere promoted: Mahabat Khan obtained the rank of 2,000 personal\r\nand 1,300 horse, Dilawar Khan 2,000 personal and 1,400 horse,\r\nWaziru-l-mulk 1,300 personal and 550 horse, Qayyam Khan 1,000\r\npersonal and horse, Shyam Singh 1,500 personal and 1,200 horse;\r\nin the same way forty-two mansabdars were promoted. On most days\r\nthe same observances occur. I presented Parwiz with a ruby of the\r\nvalue of 25,000 rupees. On Wednesday the 9th of the aforesaid month,\r\nthe 21st of Shahriwar, [155] after three watches and four gharis,\r\nthe feast for my solar weighing, which is the commencement of the\r\n38th year of my age, took place. According to custom they got ready\r\nthe weighing apparatus and the scales in the house of Maryam-zamani\r\n(his mother). At the moment appointed blessings were invoked and I sate\r\nin the scales. Each suspending rope was held by an elderly person who\r\noffered up prayers. The first time the weight in gold came to three\r\nHindustani maunds and ten seers. After this I was weighed against\r\nseveral metals, perfumes, and essences, up to twelve weighings, the\r\ndetails of which will be given hereafter. Twice a year I weigh myself\r\nagainst gold and silver and other metals, and against all sorts of\r\nsilks and cloths, and various grains, etc., once at the beginning\r\nof the solar year and once at that of the lunar. The weight of the\r\nmoney of the two weighings I hand over to the different treasurers\r\nfor faqirs and those in want. On the same auspicious day I promoted\r\nQutbu-d-din Khan Koka, who for many years had expected such a day,\r\n[156] with various favours. First, I gave him the rank of 5,000\r\npersonal and horse, and with this a special robe of honour, a jewelled\r\nsword, and one of my own horses, with a jewelled saddle, and I gave\r\nhim leave to go to the subahdarship of the province of Bengal and\r\nOrissa, which is a place for 50,000 horse. As a mark of honour he\r\nset off accompanied by a large force, and two lakhs of rupees were\r\ngiven him as a sumptuary allowance. My connection with his mother is\r\nsuch that as in my childhood I was under her guardianship and care,\r\nI have not so much affection for my own mother as for her. She is to\r\nme my gracious mother, and I do not hold him less dear than my own\r\nbrothers and children. Qutbu-d-din is the foster-brother who is most\r\nfit for fosterage. I gave 300,000 rupees to his auxiliaries. On this\r\nday I sent 130,000 as a marriage present (sachiq) for the daughter\r\nof Pahari (his brother Murad), who had been betrothed to Parwiz.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd, Baz Bahadur Qalmaq, who had long been guilty of evil\r\npractices in Bengal, by the guidance of fortune obtained the honour\r\nof kissing my threshold. I gave him a jewelled dagger, 8,000 rupees,\r\nand promoted him to the rank of 1,000 personal and horse. One lakh of\r\nrupees and cash and jewels were bestowed on Parwiz. Kesho Das Maru\r\nwas promoted to the grade of 1,500 personal and horse. Abu-l-hasan,\r\nwho had been the diwan and factotum of my brother Daniyal, together\r\nwith his children, [157] had the honour of an audience, and was\r\nraised to the rank of 1,000 personal and 500 horse. On the 1st of the\r\nsecond Jumada Shaikh Bayazid, [158] who was one of the shaikhzadas\r\nof Sikri, well known for brilliance of understanding and knowledge,\r\nand the connection of old service, [159] was honoured with the title\r\nof Mu`azzam Khan, and to him I gave the government of Delhi. On the\r\n21st of the same month I presented Parwiz with a necklace composed\r\nof four rubies and one hundred pearls. The rank of Hakim Muzaffar\r\nwas fixed at 3,000 personal and 1,000 horse, original and extra. I\r\ngave 5,000 rupees to Nathu Mal (?), Raja of Manjholi. [160]\r\n\r\nA remarkable occurrence was the discovery of a letter from Mirza `Aziz\r\nKoka to `Ali Khan, the ruler of Khandesh. I had had an impression\r\nthat he had a particular enmity to me on Khusrau's account, who was\r\nhis son-in-law. From the discovery of this writing it became clear\r\nthat he had never given up his innate treachery, and had adopted\r\nthis unbecoming attitude towards my revered father also. In short,\r\nthis letter which he had written at some time to Raja `Ali Khan was\r\nfrom beginning to end full of abuse and disapprobation, and said\r\nthings which no enemy even could have written and such as could\r\nnot be attributed to anyone, and far less to one like His Majesty,\r\n`Arsh-ashyani, a king and an appreciative sovereign, who from childhood\r\nhad educated him and brought him up because of what was due for\r\nservices rendered by his mother, and raised the standard of reliance\r\non him to such a high degree as no other person possessed. This letter\r\nfell into the hands of Khwaja Abu-l-hasan in Burhanpur amongst the\r\nproperty of Raja `Ali Khan. He brought and laid it before me. In\r\nreading and seeing it the hair on my limbs stood on end. But for\r\nthe consideration and due recognition of the fact that his mother\r\nhad given her milk to my father I could have killed him with my own\r\nhand. Having procured his attendance I gave the letter into his hand\r\nand told him to read it with a loud voice to those present. When he\r\nsaw the letter I thought his body would have parted from his soul,\r\nbut with shamelessness and impudence he read it as though he had\r\nnot written it and was reading it by order. Those present in that\r\nparadise-like assembly of the servants of Akbar and Jahangir and heard\r\nthe letter read, loosened the tongue of reproach and of curses and\r\nabuse. I put the question to him, \"Leaving aside the treacheries which\r\nin reliance on your worthless self you contrived against my fortune,\r\nwhat was done to you by my father, who raised you and your family\r\nfrom the dust of the road to such wealth and dignity as to make you\r\nthe envy of your contemporaries, that you should write these things\r\nto the enemies of his Empire? Why did you enrol yourself amongst the\r\nwicked and disloyal? Truly, what can one make of an original nature and\r\ninnate disposition? Since your temperament has been nourished by the\r\nwater of treachery, what else can spring up but such actions? Passing\r\nover what you did to myself, I gave you the rank you had held before,\r\nthinking that your treachery was directed against me only. Since it\r\nhas become known that you behaved in a similar way to your benefactor\r\nand visible Deity, I leave you to the thoughts and actions which you\r\nformerly had and still have.\" After these remarks his lips closed,\r\nand he was unable to make any reply. What could he have said in the\r\npresence of such disgrace? I gave an order to deprive him of his\r\njagir. Although what this ingrate had done was unpardonable, yet in\r\nthe end, from certain considerations, I passed it over.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday the 26th of the above-mentioned month was held the marriage\r\nfeast of Parwiz and the daughter of Prince Murad. The ceremony was\r\nperformed in the house of Her Highness Maryam-zamani. The entertainment\r\nwas arranged in the house of Parwiz, and all who were present were\r\nexalted with all kinds of honour and civilities. Nine thousand rupees\r\nwere handed over to Sharif Amuli and other nobles, to be given in\r\nalms to faqirs and other poor people.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday the 10th Rajab I left the city to hunt in Girjhak and\r\nNandana, [161] and took up my quarters in the garden of Ram Das,\r\nwhere I remained four days.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday the 13th the solar weighing of Parwiz took place. They\r\nweighed him twelve times against various metals and other things,\r\nand each weighing came to two maunds and eighteen seers. I ordered\r\nthe whole to be distributed amongst faqirs. At this time the rank\r\nof Shaja`at Khan was fixed at 1,500 personal and 700 horse, original\r\nand extra.\r\n\r\nAfter the march of Mirza Ghazi and his force it occurred to me to send\r\na second contingent after him. Having bestowed on Bahadur [162] Khan\r\nQurbegi the rank of 1,500 personal and 800 horse, original and extra,\r\nI started off a body of cavalry, [163] which came to about 3,000,\r\nwith him under the leadership of Shah Beg and Muhammad Amin. For the\r\nexpenses of this force 200,000 rupees were given and 1,000 musketeers\r\nwere also appointed.\r\n\r\nI left Asaf Khan to guard Khusrau and defend Lahore. The Amiru-l-umara\r\nwas deprived of the honour of waiting on me, as he had a severe illness\r\nand remained in the city. `Abdu-r-Razzaq Ma`muri, who had been summoned\r\nfrom the Rana's country, was promoted to be bakhshi at headquarters,\r\nand it was ordered that in company with `Abu-l-hasan he should perform\r\nthis service permanently. Following my father's rule, I appoint two\r\nmen in association in the discharge of the chief offices, not from\r\nwant of confidence in them, but because, as they are mortal and no\r\nman is safe from accidents or illness, if any confusion or obstacle\r\nshould present itself to one the other is there so that the affairs\r\nof the servants of God may not come to ruin.\r\n\r\nAt this time also news came that at the Dasahra, which is one of the\r\nfixed feast days of the Hindus, `Abdu-llah Khan had made an incursion\r\nfrom Kalpi, which is his jagir, into the province of Bandilah, and\r\ndisplaying great valour made prisoner Ram Chand, son of Madhukar, who\r\nfor a long time had made a centre of disturbance in that difficult\r\ncountry and taken him to Kalpi. For this service he was presented\r\nwith a standard and raised to 3,000 personal and 2,000 horse.\r\n\r\nPetitions from the subah of Bihar represented that Jahangir Quli Khan\r\nhad had a battle with Sangram, one of the chief zamindars of Bihar,\r\nwho had about 4,000 horse and innumerable foot, on account of certain\r\nopposition and disloyalty on rough land, and that on the field the\r\naforesaid Khan had exerted himself manfully. In the end Sangram died\r\nof a gunshot wound; many of his men fell in the battle, and those\r\nsaved from the sword took to flight. Since this distinguished affair\r\nhad been brought about by Jahangir Quli Khan, I promoted him to the\r\nrank of 4,500 personal and 3,500 horse.\r\n\r\nThree months and six days passed by in hunting; 581 animals were\r\ncaptured with the gun, hunting leopards and nets, and a qamargah;\r\nof these 158 were killed by my own gun. The qamargah was held twice;\r\non one occasion in Girjhak, when the ladies were present, 155 animals\r\nwere killed; and the second time, in Nandina, 110. [164] The details\r\nof the animals killed are as follows: mountain sheep, 180; mountain\r\ngoats, 29; wild asses, 10; Nilgai, 9; antelope, etc., 348.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday the 16th Shawwal I returned safe from my hunting, and\r\nwhen one watch and six gharis of day had passed I entered Lahore on\r\nthe day named. During this hunting a strange affair was witnessed. At\r\nChandwalah, where a minaret had been erected, I had wounded in the\r\nbelly a black antelope. When wounded, a sound proceeded from him\r\nsuch as I have never heard from any antelope, except in the rutting\r\nseason. Old hunters and those with me were astonished, and said they\r\nnever remembered nor had they heard from their fathers that such a\r\nvoice issued from an antelope except at rutting time. This has been\r\nwritten down because it is not void of strangeness. I found the flesh\r\nof the mountain goat more delicious than that of all wild animals,\r\nalthough its skin is exceedingly ill-odoured, so much so that even\r\nwhen tanned the scent is not destroyed. I ordered one of the largest\r\nof the he-goats to be weighed; it was 2 maunds and 24 seers, equal\r\nto 21 foreign maunds (Persian). I ordered a large ram to be weighed,\r\nand it came to 2 maunds and 3 seers Akbari, equal to 17 Persian\r\n(wilayati) maunds. The largest and strongest of the wild asses weighed\r\n9 maunds and 16 seers, equal to 76 Persian (wilayati) maunds. I have\r\nfrequently heard from hunters and those fond of the chase that at\r\na certain regular time a worm develops in the horns of the mountain\r\nram, and that this worm causes an irritation which induces the ram\r\nto fight with his hind, and that if he finds no rival he strikes his\r\nhead against a tree or a rock to allay the irritation. After enquiry it\r\nseems that the same worm appears in the horn of the female sheep, and\r\nsince the female does not fight the statement is clearly untrue. Though\r\nthe flesh of the wild ass is lawful food and most men like to eat it,\r\nit was in no way suited to my taste.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as before this time the punishment of Dulip and of his\r\nfather, Ray Ray Singh, had been ordered, there now came news that\r\nZahid Khan, the son of Sadiq Khan, and `Abdu-r-Rahim, son of Shaikh\r\nAbu-l-fazl, and Rana Shankar and Mu`izzu-l-mulk, with another force\r\nof mansabdars and followers of the Court, had heard news of Dulip\r\nin the neighbourhood of Nagor, which is in the subah of Ajmir, and\r\nhaving moved against him had found him. As he could find no way of\r\nescape, of necessity he planted a firm foot and came to blows with\r\nthe royal army. After a short encounter he was badly beaten and gave\r\nover many to slaughter, and himself, taking with him his own effects,\r\nfled into the vale of ruin.\r\n\r\n\r\n           \"With broken arms and loosened belt,\r\n            No power to fight and no care for head.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of his old age, I continued Qilij Khan in his mansab because\r\nof his service under my father, and I ordered that he should get a\r\njagir in the sarkar of Kalpi.\r\n\r\nIn the month Zi-l-qa`da the mother of Qutbu-d-din Khan Koka, who had\r\ngiven me her milk and was as a mother to me or even kinder than my\r\nown kind mother, and in whose lap I had been brought up from infancy,\r\nwas committed to the mercy of God. I placed the feet of her corpse on\r\nmy shoulders and carried her a part of the way (to her grave). Through\r\nextreme grief and sorrow I had no inclination for some days to eat,\r\nand I did not change my clothes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEAST OF THE SECOND NEW YEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday the 22nd Zi-l-qa`da, 1015 (10th March, 1607), when\r\n3 1/2 gharis of the day had passed, the sun rose to his House of\r\nHonour. They decorated the palace after the usual fashion: a great\r\nentertainment was prepared, and having seated myself at an auspicious\r\nhour on the throne of accession I exalted the nobles and courtiers\r\nwith kindness and favour. On this same auspicious day it was learned\r\nfrom the reports sent from Qandahar that the army sent under Mirza\r\nGhazi, son of Mirza Jani, to succour (which had been appointed to\r\nassist) Shah Beg Khan, had entered the city of Qandahar on the 12th\r\nof Shawwal. When the Persians heard of the arrival of the victorious\r\narmy at the last stage before the aforesaid city, [165] they became\r\nsurprised and wretched and repentant, and did not draw rein until\r\nthey had reached the Helmand, fifty or sixty kos distant.\r\n\r\nIn the second place it became known that the governor of Farah\r\nand a number of the officers of that neighbourhood had taken it\r\ninto their heads, after the death of the late king, that in this\r\nconfusion Qandahar might easily fall into their hands, and without\r\nwaiting for an order from Shah `Abbas had collected together and won\r\nover the Chief of Sewistan (Sistan). Sending someone to Husain Khan,\r\nthe governor of Herat they asked for support from him. He also sent a\r\nforce. After that they turned to attack Qandahar. Shah Beg Khan, the\r\ngovernor of that place, seeing that battle has two heads, and that if\r\n(which God forbid!) he should be defeated he would lose possession\r\nof Qandahar, thought that to confine himself in a fort would be\r\nbetter than to fight. He therefore determined to hold the fort, and\r\nsent quick messengers to the Court. It happened that at this time\r\nthe royal standards had started from Agra in pursuit of Khusrau,\r\nand had arrived at Lahore. Immediately on hearing this news (from\r\nShah Beg Khan), a large force was sent off of amirs and mansabdars\r\nunder Mirza Ghazi. Before the Mirza reached Qandahar the news had\r\nbeen carried to the Shah (of Persia) that the governor of Farah, with\r\nsome of the jagirdars of that neighbourhood, had proceeded towards\r\nthe province of Qandahar. Considering this an improper proceeding,\r\nhe sent Husain Beg, a well-known man and one of his own intimates to\r\nmake enquiries. He also sent a farman in their names that they should\r\nmove away from the vicinity of Qandahar and go to their own places\r\nand abodes, because the friendship and amity of his ancestors with the\r\ndignified family of Jahangir Padshah were of old standing. That body,\r\nbefore the arrival of Husain Beg and the King's order, not being able\r\nto oppose the royal army, considered the opportunity of returning a\r\nfavourable one. The said Husain Beg censured the men and started off\r\nto wait on me, which he had the honour to do at Lahore. He explained\r\nthat the ill-fated army which had attacked Qandahar had acted without\r\nthe order of Shah `Abbas. God forbid (he said) that in consequence\r\nof this any unpleasantness should remain in my mind. In short, after\r\nthe victorious troops reached Qandahar, they, according to orders,\r\ndelivered the fort over to Sardar Khan, and Shah Beg Khan returned\r\nto Court with the relieving force.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th Zi-l-qa`da, `Abdu-llah Khan, having brought Ram Chand\r\nBandilah into captivity and chains, brought him before me. I ordered\r\nthem to take the fetters from his legs, and bestowed on him a robe of\r\nhonour, and handed him over to Raja Baso that he might take security\r\nand release him and a number of his relations who had been captured\r\nwith him. This through my clemency and kindness came to pass. He had\r\nnever imagined such clemency and kindness as I showed to him.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd Zi-l-hijja I gave my son Khurram a tuman u tugh, a\r\nflag and drums, and bestowed on him the rank of 8,000 personal\r\nand 5,000 horse, and gave an order for a jagir. On the same day,\r\nhaving exalted Pir Khan, [166] son of Daulat Khan Lodi, who had\r\ncome from Khandesh with the children of Daniyal, with the title of\r\nSalabat Khan and honoured him with the rank of 3,000 personal and\r\n1,500 horse, and presented him with a standard and drums, I promoted\r\nhim to the distinction of sonship (farzandi) beyond his fellows and\r\nequals. The ancestors and uncles of Salabat Khan's grandfather had\r\nbeen great and honourable among the tribe of Lodi. An earlier Daulat\r\nKhan, uncle of Salabat Khan's grandfather, when Ibrahim after his\r\nfather Sikandar's death, began to behave ill to his father's amirs\r\nand destroyed many, became apprehensive, and sent his younger son,\r\nDilawar Khan, to wait upon H.M. Babar in Kabul, and suggested to him\r\nthe acquisition of Hindustan. As Babar also had this enterprise in\r\nmind, he at once proceeded in that direction, and did not turn his\r\nrein till he reached the neighbourhood of Lahore. Daulat Khan with his\r\nfollowers obtained the good fortune to wait upon him, and performed\r\nloyal service. As he was an old man, adorned with inward and outward\r\nexcellencies, he did much good service. He (Babar) generally called him\r\n\"father,\" and entrusting to him as before [167] the government of the\r\nPanjab placed its amirs and jagirdars under his jurisdiction. Taking\r\nDilawar Khan with him he (Babar) returned to Kabul. When he (Babar)\r\ncame a second time into the Panjab with intent to invade Hindustan,\r\nDaulat Khan waited on him, and about the same time died. Dilawar Khan\r\nwas honoured with the title of Khankhanan and was with Babar in the\r\nbattle he had with Ibrahim. In the same way he was permanently in\r\nwaiting on the late king Humayun. In the thana of Mungir, at the time\r\nof his (Humayun's) return from Bengal, he fought bravely against Shir\r\nKhan Afghan, and was made prisoner on the field of battle. Although\r\nShir Khan urged him to take service with him, he refused and said,\r\n\"Thy ancestors were always the servants of mine: how, then, could I\r\ndo this?\" Shir Khan was enraged, and ordered him to be shut up in a\r\nwall. [168]\r\n\r\n`Umar Khan, the grandfather of Salabat Khan Farzand, who was cousin\r\nof Dilawar Khan, had been treated with respect in the time of Salim\r\nKhan. After Salim Khan's death and the slaughter of Firuz, his son,\r\nat the hand of Muhammad Khan, `Umar Khan and his brethren became\r\nsuspicious of Muhammad Khan and went to Gujarat, where `Umar Khan\r\ndied. Daulat Khan, his son, who was a brave young man of pleasant\r\nappearance, and good at all things, chose the companionship of\r\n`Abdu-r-Rahim, son of Bairam Khan, who had been dignified with the\r\ntitle of Khankhanan in the reign of Akbar, and performed excellent\r\nservice. The Khankhanan regarded him as his own brother, or even\r\na thousand times better than his brother, and dearer. Most of the\r\nKhankhanan's victories were gained through Daulat Khan's valour and\r\nmanliness. [169] When my revered father, having taken the province\r\nof Khandesh and the fort of Asir, returned to Agra, he left Daniyal\r\nin charge of that province and of all the provinces acquired from the\r\nrulers of the Deccan. At this time Daniyal had separated Daulat Khan\r\nfrom the Khankhanan, and was keeping him in attendance on himself and\r\nhanding over to him for disposal all the business of the State. He\r\nshowed him much favour and perfect affection until he died in his\r\nservice. He left two sons, one Muhammad Khan, and the other Pir\r\nKhan; Muhammad Khan, who was the elder, died a short time after\r\nhis father. Daniyal, too, wore himself out with drinking. After my\r\naccession I summoned Pir Khan to Court. As I discovered in him a good\r\ndisposition and natural abilities, I raised the pedestal of regard for\r\nhim to the point that has been described. To-day there is not in my\r\ngovernment any person of greater influence than he, so much so that\r\non his representation I pass over faults which are not pardoned at\r\nthe intercession of any of the other servants of the Court. In short,\r\nhe is a young man of good disposition, brave, and worthy of favour,\r\nand what I have done for him has been done rightly, and he will be\r\nexalted by further favours. [170]\r\n\r\nAs I had made up my exalted mind to the conquest of Mawara'a-n-nahr\r\n(Transoxiana), which was the hereditary kingdom of my ancestors, I\r\ndesired to free the face of Hindustan from the rubbish of the factious\r\nand rebellious, and leaving one of my sons in that country, to go\r\nmyself with a valiant army in due array, with elephants of mountainous\r\ndignity and of lightning speed, and taking ample treasure with me,\r\nto undertake the conquest of my ancestral dominions. In accordance\r\nwith this idea, I despatched Parwiz to drive back the Rana, and\r\nintended to go myself to the Deccan, when just at that moment the\r\nimproper action of Khusrau took place, and it became necessary to\r\npursue him and put an end to that disturbance. For the same reason,\r\nthe undertaking of Parwiz did not assume a promising appearance,\r\nand regarding the exigency of the time he gave a respite to the\r\nRana. Bringing with him one of the Rana's sons, he came to wait on\r\nme, and had the bliss of attending me in Lahore. When I was at ease\r\nabout Khusrau's disturbance, and the repulse of the Qizilbashes,\r\nwho had invested Qandahar, had been brought about in a facile way,\r\nit came into my mind to make a hunting tour to Kabul, which is like my\r\nnative land. After that I would return to Hindustan, when the purposes\r\nof my mind would pass from design to action. In pursuance of these\r\nsteps, on the 7th Zi-l-hijja, at an auspicious hour, I left the fort\r\nof Lahore and took up my quarters in the Dil-amiz Garden, which is\r\non the other side of the Ravi, and stayed there four days. Sunday,\r\nthe 19th Farwardin, which is the culmination of His Majesty the Sun,\r\nI passed in the garden, and some of the servants of the Court were\r\nfavourably and kindly honoured with increased rank. Ten thousand\r\nrupees were bestowed on Hasan Beg, the envoy of the ruler of Persia\r\n(Shah `Abbas). Leaving Qilij Khan, Miran Sadr Jahan, and Mir Sharif\r\nAmuli in Lahore, I ordered them to settle in consultation any matters\r\nthat might present themselves. On Monday I marched from the garden\r\nmentioned, and encamped at the village of Harhar, 3 1/2 kos distant\r\nfrom the city. On Tuesday the royal standards alighted at Jahangirpur,\r\nwhich is one of my fixed hunting-places. In this neighbourhood had been\r\nerected by my order a manar at the head of the grave of an antelope\r\ncalled Mansaraj, [171] which was without equal in fights with tame\r\nantelopes and in hunting wild ones. On a stone of that manar was\r\ncarved this prose composition, written by Mulla Muhammad Husain of\r\nKashmir, who was the chief of the elegant writers of the day: \"In this\r\nenchanting place an antelope came into the world-holding (jahan-giri)\r\nnet of the God-knowing ruler Nuru-d-din Jahangir Padshah. In the\r\nspace of one month, having overcome his desert fierceness, he became\r\nthe head of the special antelopes.\" On account of the rare quality of\r\nthis antelope, I commanded that no person should hunt the deer of this\r\nplain, and that their flesh should be to Hindus and Muhammadans as is\r\nthe flesh of cows and pigs. They made the gravestone in the shape of\r\nan antelope. I ordered Sikandar Mu`in, the jagirdar of the aforesaid\r\npargana, to build a strong fort in the village of Jahangirpur.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the 14th, I encamped in the pargana of Chandala. [172]\r\nThence on Saturday, the 16th, making one stage in the middle, I came\r\nto Hafizabad. [173] I stayed in the station which had been erected by\r\nthe exertions of the karori of that place, Mir Qiyamu-d-din. Having\r\nreached the Chenab in two marches on Thursday, the 21st Zi-l-hijja,\r\nI crossed the river by a bridge which had been built there and my\r\ncamp was pitched in the neighbourhood of the pargana of Gujrat. At\r\nthe time when His Majesty Akbar went to Kashmir, a fort had been\r\nbuilt on that bank of the river. Having brought to this fort a body\r\nof Gujars who had passed their time in the neighbourhood in thieving\r\nand highway robbery, he established them here. As it had become the\r\nabode of Gujars, he made it a separate pargana, and gave it the name\r\nof Gujrat. They call Gujars a caste which does little manual work\r\nand subsists on milk and curds. On Friday I pitched at Khawasspur,\r\nfive kos from Gujrat, founded by Khawass Khan, a slave of Shir Khan\r\nAfghan. Thence, with two halts in the middle, I pitched on the bank of\r\nthe Bihat (Jhelam). On that night a great wind blew and a black cloud\r\nhid the face of the sky. The rain was of such violence that old men\r\nremembered none such. It turned to hail, and every hailstone was the\r\nsize of a hen's egg. From the flooding of the river and the force of\r\nthe wind and rain, the bridge broke. I, with the inmates of the harem,\r\ncrossed in a boat. As there were few boats, I ordered the men not\r\n[174] to cross in these, but to rebuild the bridge. It was finished\r\nin a week, and the whole army crossed with ease. The source of the\r\nBihat is a spring in Kashmir called the Vir-nag; in the language\r\nof India a snake is vir-nag. Clearly there had been a large snake\r\nat that place. I went twice to the spring in my father's lifetime;\r\nit is 20 kos from the city of Kashmir. It is an octagonal reservoir\r\nabout 20 yards by 20. Near it are the remains of a place of worship\r\nfor recluses; cells cut out of the rock and numerous caves. The water\r\nis exceedingly pure. Although I could not guess its depth, a grain of\r\npoppy-seed is visible until it touches the bottom. There were many\r\nfish to be seen in it. As I had heard that it was unfathomable, I\r\nordered them to throw in a cord with a stone attached, and when this\r\ncord was measured in gaz it became evident that the depth was not\r\nmore than once and a half the height of a man. After my accession I\r\nordered them to build the sides of the spring round with stone, and\r\nthey made a garden round it with a canal; and built halls and houses\r\nabout it, and made a place such that travellers over the world can\r\npoint out few like it. When the river reaches the village of Pampur,\r\nat a distance of ten kos from the city, it increases, and all the\r\nsaffron of Kashmir is obtained in this village. I do not know if there\r\nis so much saffron in any other place in the world. The annual crop\r\nis 500 maunds by Hindustan weight, equal to 5,000 wilayat (Persian)\r\nmaunds. In attendance on my revered father, I went to this place at\r\nthe season when the saffron was in flower. On other plants of the\r\nworld, first the branches (stems) shoot out and then the leaves and\r\nflowers. On the contrary, when the saffron stem is four fingers breadth\r\nfrom the dry ground, its flowers shoot out, of the colour of the iris,\r\n[175] with four petals, and in the middle are four threads (risha)\r\nof an orange colour like that of the flower, and of the length\r\nof a finger-joint. This is the saffron. The land is not ploughed\r\n[176] or irrigated, the plant springs up amongst the clods. In some\r\nplaces its cultivation extends for a kos, and in others for half a\r\nkos. It looks better from a distance. At the time of plucking, all\r\nmy attendants got headache from its sharp scent. Though I drank wine\r\nand took a cup, I too got headache. I asked the animal-like Kashmiris,\r\nwho were employed in picking the flowers how they felt. I ascertained\r\nthat they had never experienced headache in their lives.\r\n\r\nThe waters from the spring Vir-nag and of other streams and nullahs\r\nthat join from right and left form the river Bihat, which passes\r\nthrough the heart of the city. Its breadth in most places is not\r\nmore than a bowshot. [177] No one drinks its water, because of its\r\nheaviness and indigestibility. All the people of Kashmir drink the\r\nwater of a lake that is near the city, and is called Dall. The river\r\nBihat enters this lake and flows through to the Panjab by the Baramula\r\nPass, Pakli, and Dantur.\r\n\r\nIn Kashmir there is plenty of water from streams and springs. By\r\nfar the best is that of the Lar valley, which joins the Bihat in the\r\nvillage of Shihabu-d-din-pur. This village is one of the celebrated\r\nplaces of Kashmir, and is on the Bihat. About a hundred plane-trees\r\n(chanar) of graceful form clustered [178] together on one plot of\r\nground, pleasant and green, join each other so as to shade the whole\r\nplot, and the whole surface of the ground is grass and trefoil [179];\r\nso much so that to lay a carpet on it would be superfluous and in\r\nbad taste. The village was founded by Sultan Zainu-l-`abidin, who for\r\n52 years ruled Kashmir with absolute sway. They speak of him as the\r\ngreat Padshah. They tell many strange customs of his. There are many\r\nremains and traces of buildings of his in Kashmir. One of these is in\r\nthe midst of a lake called Wulur, and of which the length and breadth\r\nare more than three or four kos. It is called Zain-lanka, and in making\r\nit they have exerted themselves greatly. The springs of this lake are\r\nvery deep. The first time they brought a large quantity of stone in\r\nboats and poured it on the place where now the building stands it had\r\nno result. At last they sank some thousands of boats with stones, and\r\nwith great labour recovered a piece of ground 100 gaz by 100 gaz out\r\nof the water, and made a terrace, and on one side thereof the Sultan\r\nerected a temple for the worship of his supreme God. Than this there\r\nis no finer place. [180] He often came to the spot by boat and engaged\r\nin worship of the King of Wisdom. They say he spent many \"forty days\"\r\nin that place. One day a wicked son of his came to that place to\r\nkill him, and finding him alone, drew a sword and went in. When his\r\neye fell on the Sultan, however, on account of his venerable dignity\r\nand the might of his virtues, he became confused and bewildered and\r\nturned away. The Sultan shortly after came out and seated himself in\r\nthe boat with this same son, and started for the city. On the way\r\nhe said to his son, \"I have forgotten my rosary; get into a canoe\r\nand fetch it for me.\" The son having gone into the temple sees his\r\nfather in the same place, and the graceless man with complete shame of\r\nface falls at his father's feet and asks pardon for his fault. They\r\nhave told many tales of such miracles as this of him, and they say\r\nalso that he had well practised the science of khala`. [181] When,\r\nfrom the ways and methods of his sons, he perceived in them signs\r\nof haste in seeking for rule and government, he would say to them,\r\n\"To me it is very easy to abandon rule, and even to pass away from\r\nlife, but when I am gone you will do nothing and the time of your\r\nprosperity will not endure long, but in a short time you will obtain\r\nthe recompense of your evil deeds and your own dispositions.\" Having\r\nspoken thus, he gave up eating and drinking, and passed forty days in\r\nthis manner. He made not his eye acquainted with sleep, and employed\r\nhimself after the manner of men of piety and austerity in the worship\r\nof God Almighty. On the fortieth day he gave up the deposit of his\r\nexistence, and entered into the mercy of God. He left three sons--Adam\r\nKhan, Haji Khan, and Bahram Khan. They quarrelled with each other, and\r\nall three were ruined. The government of Kashmir was transferred to the\r\ntribe of the Chaks, who belonged to the class of the common soldiers\r\nof the country. During their dynasty three of the rulers constructed\r\nbuildings on three sides of the terrace formed by Zainu-l-`abidin in\r\nthe Wulur Lake, but none of these is as strong as his.\r\n\r\nAutumn and Spring in Kashmir are things worthy to be seen. I witnessed\r\nthe Autumn season, and it appeared to me to be better than what I had\r\nheard of it. I have never seen Spring in that province, but hope to\r\ndo so some day. On Saturday the 1st of Muharram (18th April, 1607)\r\nI left the bank of the Bihat, and with one day between reached the\r\nfort of Rohtas, which was built by Shir Khan Afghan. This fort was\r\nfounded in a cleft of the ground, and the strength of it cannot be\r\nimagined. As the place is near the Ghakhar territory, and they are a\r\nproud and rebellious people, he had looked to this fort specially as a\r\nmeans of punishing and defeating them. When a little of the building\r\nhad been done Shir Khan died and his son, Salim Khan, obtained the\r\ngrace to complete it. On each of the gates [182] they have carved on\r\na stone the cost of erecting the fort; 16 krors, 10 lakhs of dams,\r\nand more were expended, equal in Hindustan reckoning to 4,025,000\r\nrupees, and according to the currency of Iran to 120,000 tuman,\r\nand in the currency of Turan to 1 arb, 21 lakhs and 75,000 khani,\r\nthat are now current. [183]\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday the 4th of the month, having travelled four kos and\r\nthree-quarters, I encamped at Tila. [184] Thence I came down to the\r\nvillage of Bhakra. In the Ghakhar tongue bhakra [185] is a jungle. The\r\njungle was composed of clusters of flowers, white and scentless. I\r\ncame the whole way from Tila to Bhakra in the middle of the river-bed,\r\n[186] which had running water in it, with oleander flowers of the\r\ncolour of peach-blossom. In Hindustan this plant is always in full\r\nbloom (purbar). There was much of it on the banks of this river. The\r\nhorsemen and men on foot who were with me were told to put bunches of\r\nthe flower on their heads, and whoever did not do so had his turban\r\ntaken off; a wonderful flower-bed was produced.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday the 6th of the month the halting-place was at Hatya. On\r\nthis road many palas-trees (Butea frondosa) were in blossom. This\r\nflower, too, is peculiar to the jungles of Hindustan; it has no scent,\r\nbut its colour is flaming orange. The base of the flower is black;\r\nthe flower itself is as big as a red rose. It is so beautiful that one\r\ncannot take one's eyes off it. As the air was very sweet and clouds\r\nhad hidden the sun, and rain was gently sprinkled about, I felt an\r\ninclination to drink wine. In short this road was traversed with\r\ngreat enjoyment and pleasure. They call the place Hatya because it\r\nwas founded by a Ghakkar named Hathi (elephant). From Margala to Hatya\r\nthe country is called Pothuwar. [187] In these regions there are few\r\ncrows. From Rohtas to Hatya is the place and abode of the Bhugyals,\r\n[188] who are related to and of the same ancestry as the Ghakkars.\r\n\r\nMarching on Friday the 7th, I travelled 4 1/2 kos and alighted at the\r\nstation of Pakka. [189] This place is called Pakka because the saray\r\nis of burnt brick, and in the Hindi language what is ripe (that is,\r\nnot raw material) is called pakka. The station was strangely full of\r\ndust and earth. The carts reached it with great difficulty owing to\r\nthe badness of the road. They had brought from Kabul to this place\r\nriwaj (rhubarb), which was mostly spoiled.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday the 8th we marched 4 1/2 kos and encamped at the\r\nvillage of Khar. [190] Khar in the Ghakkar language is a rent and\r\nbreakage. There are few trees in this country. On Sunday the 9th I\r\nhalted beyond Rawalpindi. This place was founded by a Hindu named\r\nRawal, and pindi in the Ghakkar tongue means a village. In the valley\r\nnear this station there was a stream flowing, the waters of which\r\nwere collected in a pool. As this halting-place was not devoid of\r\nfreshness I alighted there for a time, and I asked the Ghakkars the\r\ndepth of the pool. They gave me no precise answer, but said they had\r\nheard from their fathers that there were alligators in the pool which\r\nwounded animals that came there, and on that account no one had the\r\nboldness to go in. I ordered them to throw in a sheep. It swam across\r\nthe pool and came out. I then ordered a farrash to go in, and he also\r\ncame out safe. It thus became clear that there was no foundation for\r\nwhat the Ghakkars had said. The pool was an arrow's flight in width.\r\n\r\nOn Monday the 10th the village of Kharbuza [191] was our stage. The\r\nGhakkars in earlier times had built a dome here and taken tolls\r\nfrom travellers. As the dome was shaped like a melon it became\r\nknown by that name. On Tuesday the 11th I halted at Kala-pani,\r\nwhich in Hindi means black water. There is a mountain pass (kotal)\r\nat this place called Margalla; in Hindi mar means to beat and galla\r\nis a caravan, the name therefore means the place of the plundering of\r\nthe caravan. The boundary of the Ghakkar country is here. This tribe\r\nare wonderfully like animals; they are always squabbling and fighting\r\nwith one another. Although I wished to put an end to this fighting,\r\nI was unable to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"The soul of the fool is doomed to trouble.\" [192]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday the 12th the camp was at Baba Hasan Abdal. One kos to\r\nthe east of this station there is a waterfall over which the stream\r\nrushes with great force. There is no fall like it on the way to\r\nKabul. On the road to Kashmir there are two or three like it. [193]\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the basin, in which is the source of the stream,\r\nRaja Man Singh has erected a small building. There are many fish in\r\nthe basin of the length of half a gaz and a quarter gaz. I halted\r\nthree days at this enchanting place, drinking wine with those who were\r\nintimate with me and employing myself in catching fish. Until now I had\r\nnever thrown a sufra net, which is a famous kind of net, and which in\r\nHindi they call bhanwar [194] jal. It is not easy to throw. I threw\r\nit with my own hand and caught twelve fish, and putting pearls into\r\ntheir noses, [195] let them loose in the water. I enquired into the\r\nstory of Baba Hasan from the story-tellers and from the inhabitants of\r\nthe place, but no one could tell me any particulars. The celebrated\r\nplace at that station is a spring which flows from the foot of a\r\nlittle hill, exceedingly clear, sweet, and nice, as witness this\r\ncouplet of Amir Khusrau:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"In the bottom of the water, from its clearness, a blind man\r\n    Can count the sand-grains in the heart of the night.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nKhwaja Shamsu-d-din Muhammad Khwafi, who was for long employed as\r\nVizier by my revered father, had made a platform and a reservoir there,\r\ninto which is led the water from the spring, and thence is used in\r\ncultivation and in gardens. On the edge of this terrace he had built\r\na dome for his own burial. By chance his destiny was not there, and\r\n(the bodies of) Hakim Abu-l-fath Gilani and his brother Hakim Humam,\r\nwho were close to the person and had the complete confidence of my\r\nrevered father, were placed in that dome in accordance with his order.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th the halt was at Amrohi. [196] It is a wonderfully green\r\nplace, in which no ups and downs were visible. In this village and\r\nits neighbourhood there are 7,000 or 8,000 households of Khaturs and\r\nDalazaks. All kinds of mischief and oppression and highway robbery\r\ntake place through this tribe. I ordered the government of this\r\nregion and Attock to be given to Zafar Khan, son of Zain Khan Koka,\r\nand that by the time of the return of the royal standards from Kabul\r\nthey should march all the Dalazaks to Lahore and capture the head\r\nmen of the Khaturs and keep them in prison.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 17th, a march was made, and, with one stage in between,\r\nthe royal standards alighted near the fort of Attock on the bank of\r\nthe river Nilab (Indus). At this stage Mahabat Khan was promoted to\r\nthe rank of 2,500. This fort was built by the late king Akbar, and\r\nwas completed by the labours of Khwaja Shamsu-d-din Khwafi. It is a\r\nstrong fort. At this time the water of the Nilab was low, [197] and\r\naccordingly a bridge had been made with eighteen boats, and the people\r\ncrossed over easily. I left the Amiru-l-umara at Attock on account of\r\nweakness of body and illness. An order was given to the bakhshis that,\r\nas the province of Kabul could not support a large army, they should\r\nonly allow the immediate attendants of the Court to cross the river,\r\nand until the return of the royal standards the royal camp should\r\nremain at Attock. On Wednesday, the 19th, with the princes and some of\r\nthe private servants, having mounted on to a raft (with inflated skins\r\nunderneath), and having crossed the river Nilab safely, I alighted on\r\nthe bank of the river Kama. The Kama is a river that flows by the qasba\r\n(fortified town) of Jalalabad. The jala is a structure they make of\r\nbamboos and grass and place underneath it skins full of air. In this\r\nprovince they call them shal (or sal). In rivers and streams in which\r\nthere are rocks they are safer than boats. 12,000 rupees were given\r\nto Mir Sharif Amuli and to a number of men, who had been appointed\r\nto perform services at Lahore, to divide amongst the faqirs. An\r\norder was given to `Abdu-r-Razzaq Ma`muri [198] and to Bihari Das,\r\nbakhshi of the Ahadis, to complete the force that had been appointed\r\nto accompany Zafar Khan and send them away. With one stage in between,\r\nthe camp halted at the saray of Bara. On the other side of the river\r\nKama there is a fort which Zain Khan Koka built at the time when he\r\nwas appointed to subjugate the Yusufza'e Afghans, and called Naushahr\r\n(Newcastle). About 50,000 rupees were spent upon it. They say that\r\nHumayun used to hunt rhinoceros in this region. I also heard from my\r\nfather that he had twice or thrice witnessed such a hunt in the company\r\nof his father. On Thursday, the 25th, I alighted at the saray of\r\nDaulatabad. Ahmad Beg of Kabul, jagirdar of Peshawar, with the Maliks\r\nof the Yusufza'es and the Ghoriya-khel, came and waited on me. As the\r\nservice of Ahmad Beg was not approved, I transferred him from that\r\nterritory (wilayat) and conferred it on Shir Khan, the Afghan. On\r\nWednesday, the 26th, I encamped in the garden of Sardar Khan, which he\r\nhad made in the neighbourhood of Peshawar. I walked round Ghorkhatri,\r\nwhich is the worshipping-place of the jogis in this neighbourhood,\r\nwith the idea that I might see some faqirs from association with\r\nwhom I might obtain grace. But that was like looking for the phoenix\r\nor the philosopher's stone. A herd without any religious knowledge\r\ncame to my view, from seeing whom I derived nothing but obscurity of\r\nmind. On Thursday, the 27th, I arrived at the halting-place of Jamrud,\r\nand on Friday, 28th, at the Khaibar Kotal (Khyber Pass) and encamped\r\nat `Ali Masjid, and on Saturday I traversed the tortuous (marpich,\r\ni.e. snake-twisting) Pass, and alighted at Gharib-khana. At this stage\r\nAbu-l-qasim Namakin, Jagirdar of Jalalabad, brought an apricot, which\r\nwas not inferior in beauty to good Kashmir apricots. At the stage\r\nof Daka they brought from Kabul gilas (cherries), which my revered\r\nfather had entitled Shah-alu. As I was much inclined to eat them,\r\ninasmuch as I had not (hitherto?) obtained them, I ate them with\r\ngreat zest as a relish to wine. On Tuesday, 2nd Safar, I encamped\r\nat Basawal, which is on the bank of the river. On the other side of\r\nthe river there is a mountain which has no trees or grass on it,\r\nand on that account they call this mountain the hill of Bidaulat\r\n(unfortunate). I heard from my father that in mountains like this\r\nthere are mines of gold. On the mountain of Ala Bughan, at the time\r\nwhen my revered father went to Kabul, I had had a qamargah hunt, and\r\nkilled several [199] red deer. As I had handed over the administration\r\nof all civil affairs to the Amiru-l-umara, and his illness increased\r\ngreatly, and forgetfulness came over his faculties to such an extent\r\nthat what was settled in one hour he forgot in the next, and his\r\nforgetfulness was increasing day by day, on Wednesday, the 3rd Safar,\r\nI entrusted the duties of the viziership to Asaf Khan, presenting him\r\nwith a special robe of honour, and inkstand and a jewelled pen. It\r\nwas a remarkable coincidence that twenty-eight years previously to\r\nthis, at the same halting-place, my revered father had promoted him\r\n[200] to the rank of Mir Bakhshi (chief paymaster). A ruby which his\r\nbrother [201] Abu-l-qasim had bought for 40,000 rupees and sent him,\r\nhe presented as an offering on obtaining the viziership. He petitioned\r\nthat Khwaja Abu-l-hasan, who held the offices of bakhshi and the Qur,\r\netc., might go with him. Jalalabad was transferred from Abu-l-qasim\r\nNamakin to Arab Khan. A white rock was present in the river-bed; I\r\nordered them to carve it in the form of an elephant and cut upon its\r\nbreast this hemistich, which agrees with the date of the Hijra year:\r\n\"The white stone elephant of Jahangir Padshah,\" that is, 1016.\r\n\r\nOn the same day Kalyan, son of Raja Bikramajit, came from\r\nGujarat. Certain extraordinary proceedings on the part of this\r\nrebellious rascal had been reported to me. Amongst these was this. He\r\nhad kept a Musulman luli woman in his house, and for fear this affair\r\nshould become known had killed her father and mother and buried\r\nthem in his house. I ordered that he should be imprisoned until\r\nI could enquire into his proceedings, and after ascertaining the\r\ntruth I ordered first that they should cut out his tongue and place\r\nhim in perpetual confinement, and that he should eat his food with\r\ndog-keepers and outcasts. On Wednesday I encamped at Surkhab. Thence\r\nI alighted at Jagdalak. At this stage I saw many ballut [202]-trees\r\n(oak or chestnut), which are the best wood for burning. Although\r\nthis stage had neither passes nor declivities there were plenty of\r\nrocks. On Friday, the 12th, I encamped at Ab-i-barik, and Saturday,\r\nthe 13th, at Yurt-i-padshah. On Sunday, the 14th, I alighted at Khurd\r\nKabul (little Kabul). At this stage I entrusted the Chief Justiceship\r\nand Qaziship of the city of Kabul to Qazi `Arif, son of Mulla Sadiq\r\nHalwa'i. They brought some ripe shah-alu (cherries) from the village\r\nof Gulbahar to this place; of these I ate with much enjoyment nearly\r\na hundred. Daulat, the head of the village of Jigri [203](?), brought\r\nsome uncommon flowers, such as I had never seen in my life. Thence I\r\nalighted at Bikrami. At this place they brought to show me a piebald\r\n[204] animal, like the flying (i.e. jumping) mouse, which in the\r\nHindi tongue they call galahri (squirrel), and said that mice would\r\nnot frequent any house in which this animal was. On this account\r\nthey call this animal the master of mice. As I had never seen one\r\nbefore, I ordered my painters to draw a likeness of it. It is larger\r\nthan a mongoose. On the whole it is very like a civet cat. Having\r\nappointed Ahmad Beg Khan to punish the Afghans of Bangash, I ordered\r\n`Abdu-r-Razzaq Ma`muri, who was in Attock, to take 2,000,000 rupees\r\nunder the charge of Mohan Das, son of Raja Bikramajit, with him, and\r\ndivide it among the auxiliaries of the aforesaid army. One thousand\r\nmusketeers were also ordered to accompany this army.\r\n\r\nShaikh `Abdu-r-Rahman, son of Shaikh Abu-l-fazl, was promoted to\r\nthe rank of 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse, and obtained the title\r\nof Afzal Khan. 15,000 rupees were presented to `Arab Khan, and 20,000\r\nrupees more for the repair of the fort of Pesh Bulagh. [205] I bestowed\r\nSarkar Khanpur [206] in fief on Dilawar Khan Afghan. On Thursday, the\r\n17th, from the Mastan bridge as far as the Shahr-ara garden, which\r\nwas the encamping place for the royal standards, scattering rupees,\r\nhalf-rupees, and quarter-rupees to faqirs and indigent persons on both\r\nsides of the road, I entered the aforesaid garden. It appeared to be\r\nvery green and fresh. As it was a Thursday I gave a wine entertainment\r\nto my intimates, and on account of hilarity and excitement ordered\r\nthose who were of equal age to myself and had been my playfellows to\r\njump over the stream that flowed through the middle of the garden and\r\nwas about four gaz in width. Most of them could not jump it, and fell\r\non the bank or into the stream. Although I jumped it, yet now that I\r\nwas 40 years of age I could not jump it with the activity that I had\r\nshown in the presence of my revered father when I was 30. On this day\r\nI perambulated seven of the famous gardens of Kabul. I do not think\r\nthat I ever walked so far before.\r\n\r\nFirst of all I walked round the Shahr-ara (city-adorning), then the\r\nMahtab (moonlight) garden, then the garden that Bika Begam, grandmother\r\nof my father, had made, then passed through the Urta-bagh (middle\r\ngarden), then a garden that Maryam-makani, my own grandmother, had\r\nprepared, then the Surat-khana garden, which has a large chanar-tree,\r\nthe like of which there is not in the other gardens of Kabul. Then,\r\nhaving seen the Charbagh, which is the largest of the city gardens,\r\nI returned to my own abode. There were abundance of cherries on the\r\ntrees, each of which looked as it were a round ruby, hanging like\r\nglobes on the branches. The Shahr-ara garden was made by Shahr-banu\r\n[207] Begam, daughter of Mirza Abu Sa`id, who was own aunt to the late\r\nking Babar. From time to time it has been added to, and there is not\r\na garden like it for sweetness in Kabul. It has all sorts of fruits\r\nand grapes, and its softness is such that to put one's sandalled\r\n[208] feet on it would be far from propriety or good manners. In the\r\nneighbourhood of this garden an excellent plot of land came to view,\r\nwhich I ordered to be bought from the owners. I ordered a stream\r\nthat flows from the guzargah (ferry, also bleaching green) to be\r\ndiverted into the middle of the ground so that a garden might be\r\nmade such that in beauty and sweetness there should not be in the\r\ninhabited world another like it. I gave it the name of Jahan-ara\r\n(world-adorning). Whilst I was at Kabul I had several entertainments\r\nin the Shahr-ara garden, sometimes with my intimates and courtiers and\r\nsometimes with the ladies of the harem. At nights I ordered the learned\r\nand the students of Kabul to hold the cooking entertainment, [209]\r\nbughra, and the throwing of bughra, together with arghushtak dances.\r\n\r\nTo each of the band of Bughra'iyan I gave a dress of honour, and\r\nalso gave 1,000 rupees to divide amongst themselves. To twelve of\r\nthe trustworthy courtiers I ordered 12,000 rupees to be given, to\r\nbe bestowed every Thursday, as long as I was in Kabul, on the poor\r\nand needy. I gave an order that between two plane-trees that were\r\non the canal bank in the middle of the garden--to one of which I had\r\ngiven the name of Farah-bakhsh (joy-giver) and the other Saya-bakhsh\r\n(shade-giver)--they should set up a piece of white stone (marble?) one\r\ngaz in length and three-quarters of a gaz in breadth, and engrave\r\nmy name thereon (and those of my ancestors) up to Timur. It was set\r\nforth on the other side that I had done away with the whole of the\r\ncustoms dues and charges of Kabul, and whichever of my descendants\r\nand successors should do anything contrary to this would be involved\r\nin the wrath and displeasure of God. Up to the time of my accession\r\nthese were fixed and settled, and every year they took large sums\r\non this account from the servants of God (the Muhammadan people in\r\ngeneral). The abolition of this oppression was brought about during my\r\nreign. On this journey to Kabul complete relief and contentment were\r\nbrought about in the circumstances of my subjects and the people of\r\nthat place. The good and leading men of Ghaznin and that neighbourhood\r\nwere presented with robes of honour and dealt kindly with, and had\r\ntheir desires excellently gratified.\r\n\r\nIt is a strange coincidence that (the words) ruz-i-panjshanba\r\nhizhdaham-i-Safar, [210] Thursday, 18th Safar, which is the date of\r\nmy entry into Kabul, give the Hijra date thereof.\r\n\r\nI ordered them to inscribe this date on the stone. Near a seat\r\n(takht) on the slope of a hill to the south of the city of Kabul,\r\nand which is known as Takht-i-shah, they have made a stone terrace\r\nwhere Firdus-makani (Babar) used to sit and drink wine. In one corner\r\nof this rock they have excavated a round basin which could contain\r\nabout two Hindustani maunds of wine. He caused his own blessed name\r\nwith the date to be carved on the wall of the terrace which is next\r\nto the hill. The wording is, \"The seat of the king, the asylum of\r\nthe world, Zahiru-d-din Muhammad Babar, son of `Umar Shaikh Gurgan,\r\nmay God perpetuate his kingdom, 914 (1508-9).\" I also ordered them\r\nto cut out of stone another throne parallel to this, and dig another\r\nbasin of the same fashion on its side, and engrave my name there,\r\ntogether with that of Sahib-qirani (Timur). Every day that I sat on\r\nthat throne I ordered them to fill both of the basins with wine and\r\ngive it to the servants who were present there. One of the poets of\r\nGhaznin found the date of my coming to Kabul in this chronogram--\"The\r\nking of the cities of the seven climes\" (1016). I gave him a dress of\r\nhonour and a present, and ordered them to engrave this date on the wall\r\nnear the aforesaid seat. Fifty thousand rupees were given to Parwiz;\r\nWazir-al-mulk was made Mir Bakhshi. A firman was sent to Qilij Khan\r\nto despatch 170,000 rupees from the Lahore treasury for expenses of\r\nthe army at Qandahar. After visiting the Khiyaban (avenue) of Kabul\r\nand the Bibi Mah-ru, I ordered the governor of that city to plant\r\nother trees in the place of those cut down by Husain Beg Ru-siyah\r\n(the black-faced). I also visited the Ulang-yurt of Chalak and found\r\nit a very pleasant place. The Ra'is of Chikri (Jigri?) shot with an\r\narrow a rang [211] and brought it to me. Up to this time I had never\r\nseen a rang. It is like a mountain goat, and there is a difference\r\nonly in its horns. The horns of the rang are bent, and those of the\r\ngoat are straight and convoluted.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the account of Kabul the commentaries of Babar\r\n[212] passed in view before me. These were in his own handwriting,\r\nexcept four sections (juz' [213]) that I wrote myself. At the end\r\nof the said sections a sentence was written by me also in the Turki\r\ncharacter, so that it might be known that these four sections were\r\nwritten by me in my own hand. Notwithstanding that I grew up in\r\nHindustan, I am not ignorant of Turki speech and writing. [214]\r\nOn the 25th Safar I with the people of the harem visited the julgah\r\n(plain) of Safid-sang, a very bright and enjoyable place. On Friday,\r\nthe 26th, I enjoyed the blessing of a pilgrimage to (the tomb of)\r\nH.M. Firdus-makani (Babar). I ordered much money and food, bread,\r\nand sweetmeats for the souls of the departed to be distributed to\r\nfaqirs. Ruqayya Sultan Begam, daughter of Mirza Hindal, had not\r\nperformed a pilgrimage to her father's tomb, and on that day had the\r\nhonour to do so. On Thursday, 3rd Rabi`u-l-awwal, I ordered them to\r\nbring my racehorses (aspan-i-dawanda) to the Khiyaban (avenue). The\r\nprinces and the Amirs raced them. A bay Arab horse, which `Adil Khan,\r\nthe ruler of the Deccan, had sent to me, ran better than all the other\r\nhorses. At this time the son of Mirza Sanjar Hazara and the son of\r\nMirza Mashi, who were the chief leaders of the Hazaras, came to wait on\r\nme. The Hazaras of the village of Mirdad produced before me two rangs\r\n[215] that they had killed with arrows. I had never seen a rang of\r\nthis size; it was larger by 20 per cent. than a large markhur (?).\r\n\r\nNews came that Shah Beg Khan, the governor of Qandahar, had reached the\r\nparganah of Shor, [216] which is his jagir. I determined to give Kabul\r\nto him and return to Hindustan. A petition came from Raja Birsing-deo\r\nthat he had made a prisoner of his nephew, who had been creating a\r\ndisturbance and had killed many of his men. I ordered him to send him\r\nto the fort of Gwalior to be imprisoned there. The parganah of Gujrat\r\n[217] in the Panjab Sarkar I bestowed on Shir Khan, the Afghan. I\r\npromoted Chin Qilij, son of Qilij Khan, to the rank of 800 personal\r\nand 500 horse. On the 12th I sent for Khusrau and ordered them to\r\ntake the chains off his legs that he might walk in the Shahr-ara\r\ngarden. My fatherly affection would not permit me to exclude him from\r\nwalking in the aforesaid garden. I transferred the fort of Attock\r\nand that neighbourhood from Ahmad Beg to Zafar Khan. To Taj Khan,\r\nwho was nominated to beat back the Afghans of Bangash, I gave 50,000\r\nrupees. On the 14th I gave `Ali Khan Karori, [218] who was one of my\r\nrevered father's old servants and was the darogha of the Naqarakhana\r\n(drum-house), the title of Naubat Khan, and promoted him to the rank\r\nof 500 personal and 200 horse. I made Ram Das ataliq to Maha Singh,\r\ngrandson of Raja Man Singh, who had also been nominated to drive\r\nback the rebels of Bangash. On Friday, the 18th, the wazn-i-qamari\r\n(the weighing according to the lunar year) for my 40th year took\r\nplace. On that day the assembly was held when two watches of the day\r\nhad passed. I gave 10,000 rupees of the money of the weighing to ten\r\nof my confidential servants to divide amongst those who deserved it\r\nand the needy. On this day a petition came from Sardar Khan, governor\r\nof Qandahar, by way of Hazara and Ghaznin, in twelve days; its purport\r\nwas that the ambassador of Shah `Abbas, who had started for the Court,\r\nhad entered the Hazara [219] (country). The Shah had written to his\r\nown people: \"What seeker of occasion and raiser of strife has come\r\nagainst Qandahar without my order? Perhaps he does not know what is our\r\nconnection with H.M. Sultan Timur, and especially with Humayun and his\r\nglorious descendants. If they by chance should have taken the country\r\ninto their possession they should hand it to the friends and servants\r\nof my brother Jahangir Padshah and return to their own abodes.\" I\r\ndetermined to tell Shah Beg Khan to secure the Ghaznin road in such a\r\nway that travellers from Qandahar might reach Kabul with ease. At the\r\nsame time I appointed Qazi Nuru-d-din to the Sadarat of the province\r\nof Malwah and Ujjain. The son of Mirza Shadman Hazara and grandson\r\nof Qaracha Khan, who was one of the influential Amirs of Humayun,\r\nwaited on me. Qaracha Khan had married a woman from the Hazara tribe,\r\nand this son [220] had been born by her. On Saturday, the 19th, Rana\r\nShankar, son of Rana Uday Singh, was promoted to the rank of 2,500\r\npersonal and 1,000 horse. An order was given for the rank of 1,000\r\npersonal and 600 horse for Ray Manohar. The Shinwari Afghans brought\r\na mountain ram the two horns of which had become one and had become\r\nlike a rang's horns. The same Afghans killed and brought a markhur\r\n(Erskine translates this 'a serpent-eating goat'), the like of which\r\nI had never seen or imagined. I ordered my artists to paint him. He\r\nweighed four Hindustani maunds; the length of his horns was 1 1/2\r\ngaz. [221] On Sunday, the 27th, I gave the rank of 1,500 personal and\r\n1,000 horse to Shaja`at Khan, and the hawili (district surrounding)\r\nof Gwalior was placed in the jagir of I`tibar Khan. I appointed\r\nQazi `Izzatu-llah with his brothers to the Bangash duty. At the end\r\nof the same day a petition came to me from Islam Khan from Agra,\r\ntogether with a letter which Jahangir Quli Khan had written to him\r\nfrom Bihar. Its purport was that on the 3rd Safar (30th May, 1607),\r\nafter the first watch, `Ali Quli Istajlu had wounded Qutbu-d-din\r\nKhan at Bardwan, in the province of Bengal, and that he had died\r\nwhen two watches of the same night had passed. The details of this\r\nmatter are that the aforesaid `Ali Quli was sufrachi (table servant)\r\nto Shah Isma`il (the 2nd), ruler of Iran; after his death he took to\r\nflight through his natural wickedness and habit of making mischief,\r\nand came to Qandahar, and having met at Multan the Khankhanan, who\r\nhad been appointed to the charge of the province of Tulamba, [222]\r\nstarted with him for that province. The Khankhanan in the field\r\n[223] placed him among the servants of the late king (Akbar), and\r\nhe having performed services in that campaign was promoted to a rank\r\nin accordance with his condition, and was a long time in the service\r\nof my revered father. At the time when he (Akbar) went in prosperity\r\nto the provinces of the Deccan, and I was ordered against the Rana,\r\nhe came and became servant to me. I gave him the title of Shir-afgan\r\n(tiger-throwing). When I came from Allahabad to wait on my revered\r\nfather, on account of the unfriendliness that was shown me, most of\r\nmy attendants and people were scattered abroad, and he also at that\r\ntime chose to leave my service. After my accession, out of generosity\r\nI overlooked his offences, and gave an order for a jagir for him in\r\nthe Subah of Bengal. Thence came news that it was not right to leave\r\nsuch mischievous persons there, and an order went to Qutbu-d-din Khan\r\nto send him to Court, and if he showed any futile, seditious ideas, to\r\npunish him. The aforesaid Khan had reason to know him (his character),\r\nand with the men he had present, immediately the order arrived, went\r\nhastily to Bardwan, which was his jagir. When he (Shir-afgan) became\r\naware of the arrival of Qutbu-d-din Khan, he went out to receive him\r\nalone with two grooms. After he arrived and entered into the midst\r\nof his army (his camp) the aforesaid Khan surrounded him. When from\r\nthis proceeding on the part of Qutbu-d-din Khan a doubt arose in his\r\nmind, he by way of deceiving him said: \"What proceeding is this of\r\nthine?\" [224] The aforesaid Khan, keeping back his own men, joined him\r\nalone in order to explain the purport of the order to him. Seeing his\r\nopportunity he immediately drew his sword and inflicted two or three\r\nsevere wounds upon him. Amba Khan Kashmiri, who was descended from the\r\nrulers of Kashmir and was connected (by marriage?) with the aforesaid\r\nKhan, and had a great regard for him by way of loyalty and manliness,\r\nrushed forward and struck a heavy blow on `Ali Quli's head, and that\r\nvicious fellow inflicted a severe wound on Amba Khan with the point\r\nof his sword. [225] When they saw Qutbu-d-din Khan in this state, his\r\nmen attacked him (Shir-afgan), and cut him in pieces and sent him to\r\nhell. It is to be hoped that the place of this black-faced scoundrel\r\nwill always be there. Amba Khan obtained martyrdom on the spot, and\r\nQutbu-d-din Khan Koka after four watches attained the mercy of God in\r\nhis quarters. What can I write of this unpleasantness? How grieved\r\nand troubled I became! Qutbu-d-din Khan Koka was to me in the place\r\nof a dear son, a kind brother, and a congenial friend. What can one\r\ndo with the decrees of God? Bowing to destiny I adopted an attitude\r\nof resignation. After the departure of the late King and the death\r\nof that honoured one, no two misfortunes had happened to me like the\r\ndeath of the mother of Qutbu-d-din Khan Koka and his own martyrdom.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, the 6th Rabi`u-l-akhir, I came to the quarters of Khurram\r\n(Shah-Jahan), which had been made in the Urta Garden. In truth,\r\nthe building is a delightful and well-proportioned one. Whereas it\r\nwas the rule of my father to have himself weighed twice every year,\r\n(once) according to the solar and (once according to the) lunar year,\r\nand to have the princes weighed according to the solar year, and\r\nmoreover in this year, which was the commencement of my son Khurram's\r\n16th lunar year, the astrologers and astronomers [226] represented\r\nthat a most important epoch according to his horoscope would occur,\r\nas the prince's health [227] had not been good, I gave an order that\r\nthey should weigh him according to the prescribed rule, against gold,\r\nsilver, and other metals, which should be divided among faqirs and\r\nthe needy. The whole of that day was passed in enjoyment and pleasure\r\nin the house of Baba Khurram, and many of his presents were approved.\r\n\r\nAs I had experienced the excellencies of Kabul, and had eaten\r\nmost of its fruits, in consequence of important considerations and\r\nthe distance from the capital, on Sunday, the 4th Jumada-l-awwal,\r\nI gave an order that they should send out the advance camp in the\r\ndirection of Hindustan. After some days I left the city, and the\r\nroyal standards proceeded to the meadow of Safid-sang. Although the\r\ngrapes were not yet fully ripe, I had often before this eaten Kabul\r\ngrapes. There are many good sorts of grapes, especially the Sahibi\r\nand Kishmishi. The cherry also is a fruit of pleasant flavour, and\r\none can eat more of it than of other fruits; I have in a day eaten\r\nup to 150 of them. The term shah-alu means gilas [228] (cherry),\r\nwhich are obtainable in most places of the country, but since gilas\r\nis like gilas, which is one of the names of the chalpasa (lizard),\r\nmy revered father called it shah-alu. The zard-alu paywandi [229] is\r\ngood, and is abundant. There is especially a tree in the Shahr-ara\r\ngarden, that Mirza Muhammad Hakim, my uncle, planted, and is known\r\nas the Mirza'i. The apricots of this tree are quite unlike the\r\napricots of other trees. The peaches also are very delicious and\r\nplentiful. They had brought some peaches from Istalif. I had them\r\nweighed in my presence, and they came exactly in weight to 25 rupees,\r\nwhich is 68 current misqal. Notwithstanding the sweetness of the Kabul\r\nfruits, not one of them has, to my taste, the flavour of the mango. The\r\nparganah of Mahaban was given as jagir to Mahabat Khan. `Abdu-r-Rahim,\r\npaymaster of the Ahadis, was promoted to the rank of 700 personal and\r\n200 horse. Mubarak Khan Sarwani was appointed to the faujdarship of\r\nthe sarkar of Hisar. I ordered that Mirza Faridun Barlas should have\r\na jagir in the Subah of Allahabad. On the 14th of the aforesaid month\r\nI gave Iradat Khan, brother of Asaf Khan, the rank of 1,000 personal\r\nand 500 horse, and presenting him with a special robe of honour and\r\na horse, bestowed on him the paymastership of the Subah of Patna and\r\nHajipur. As he was my qurbegi, I sent by his hand a jewelled sword for\r\nmy son (farzand) Islam Khan, the governor of the aforesaid Subah. As\r\nwe were going along I saw near `Ali Masjid and Gharib-khana a large\r\nspider of the size of a crab that had seized by the throat a snake\r\nof one and a half gaz in length and half strangled it. I delayed a\r\nminute to look on at this, and after a moment it died (the snake).\r\n\r\nI heard at Kabul that in the time of Mahmud of Ghazni a person of\r\nthe name of Khwaja Tabut [230] had died in the neighbourhood of\r\nZuhak and Bamiyan, and was buried in a cave, whose limbs had not yet\r\nrotted asunder. This appeared very strange, and I sent one of my\r\nconfidential record writers with a surgeon to go to the cave and,\r\nhaving seen the state of affairs as they were, to make a special\r\nreport. He represented that half of the body which was next the\r\nground had most of it come asunder, and the other half which had\r\nnot touched the ground remained in its own condition. The nails of\r\nthe hands and feet and the hair of the head had not been shed, but\r\nthe hair of the beard and moustache as far as one side of the nose\r\nhad been shed. From the date that had been engraved on the door of\r\nthe cave it appeared that his death had occurred before the time of\r\nSultan Mahmud. No one knows the exact state of the case.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the 15th Arslan Bi, governor of the fort of Kahmard,\r\nwho was one of the servants of middle rank (?) of Wali Muhammad Khan,\r\nruler of Turan, came and waited on me. [231] I had always heard that\r\nMirza Husain, son of Shahrukh Mirza, had been killed by the Uzbegs. At\r\nthis time a certain person came and presented a petition in his name,\r\nand brought a ruby of the colour of an onion, which was worth 100\r\nrupees, as an offering. He prayed that an army might be appointed\r\nto assist him, so that he might take Badakhshan out of the Uzbegs'\r\nhands. A jewelled dagger-belt was sent him, and an order given that,\r\nas the royal standards had alighted in those regions, if he really was\r\nMirza Husain, son of Mirza Shahrukh, he should first hasten into my\r\npresence, so that having examined his petitions and claims I might\r\nsend him to Badakhshan. Two hundred thousand rupees were sent for\r\nthe army that had been sent with Maha Singh and Ram Das against the\r\nrebels of Bangash.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the 22nd, having gone to the Bala Hisar, I inspected the\r\nbuildings in that place. As the place was not fit for me I ordered\r\nthem to destroy these buildings and to prepare a palace and a royal\r\nhall of audience. On the same day they brought a peach from Istalif,\r\nbarabar sar-i-buh bakalani, \"as big as an owl's head\" (?). [232]\r\nI had not seen a peach of such a size, and ordered it to be weighed,\r\nand it came to 63 Akbari rupees, or 60 tolas. When I cut it in half\r\nits stone also came into two pieces, and its substance was sweet. I\r\nhad in Kabul never eaten better fruit from any tree. On the 25th news\r\ncame from Malwa that Mirza Shahrukh had bid farewell to this transitory\r\nworld, and God Almighty had submerged him in His mercy. From the day\r\non which he entered the service of my revered father till the time\r\nof his departure, from no act of his could dust be brought into the\r\nroyal mind. He always did his duty with sincerity. The aforesaid\r\nMirza apparently had four sons: Hasan and Husain were born of the\r\nsame womb (i.e. they were twins). Husain fled from Burhanpur and went\r\nby sea to Iraq, and thence to Badakhshan, where they say he now is,\r\nas has been written about his message and his sending some one to\r\nme. No one knows for certain whether it is the same Mirza Husain,\r\nor the people of Badakhshan have raised up this one like other false\r\nMirzas and given him the name of Mirza Husain. From the time when\r\nMirza Shahrukh came from Badakhshan and had the good fortune to wait\r\non my father until now, nearly 25 years have passed. For some time the\r\npeople of Badakhshan, on account of the oppression and injury they have\r\nto undergo from the Uzbegs, have given notoriety to a Badakhshan boy,\r\nwho had on his face the marks of nobility, as really the son of Mirza\r\nShahrukh and of the race of Mirza Sulaiman. A large number of the\r\nscattered Uymaqs, and the hill-people of Badakhshan, whom they call\r\nGharchal (Georgians?), collected round him, and showing enmity and\r\ndisputing with the Uzbegs, took some of the districts of Badakhshan\r\nout of their possession. The Uzbegs attacked that false Mirza and\r\ncaptured him, and placing his head on a spear sent it round to the\r\nwhole country of Badakhshan. Again the seditious people of Badakhshan\r\nquickly produced another Mirza. Up to now several Mirzas have been\r\nkilled. It appears to me that as long as there is any trace of the\r\npeople of Badakhshan they will keep up this disturbance. The third son\r\nof the Mirza is Mirza Sultan, who excels in appearance and disposition\r\nall the other sons of the Mirza. I begged him from his revered father,\r\nand have kept him in my own service, and having taken great pains with\r\nhim reckon him as my own child. In disposition and manners he has no\r\nlikeness to his brothers. After my accession I gave him the rank of\r\n2,000 personal and 1,000 horse, and sent him to the Subah of Malwa,\r\nwhich was his father's place. The fourth son is Badi`u-z-zaman, whom\r\nhe always had in attendance on himself; he obtained the rank of 1,000\r\npersonal and 500 horse.\r\n\r\nWhile I was at Kabul, no qamargah hunt had taken place. As the time\r\nfor returning to Hindustan had come near, and I was very desirous of\r\nhunting red deer, I ordered them to go forward as soon as possible\r\nand surround the hill Faraq, [233] which is seven kos from Kabul. On\r\nTuesday, the 4th Jumada-l-awwal, I went to hunt. Nearly 100 deer had\r\ncome into the enclosure (qamargah). About a half of these were taken,\r\nand a very hot hunt took place. I gave 5,000 rupees in rewards to the\r\nryots who were present at the hunt. On the same day an increase of\r\n500 horse was ordered to the rank of Shaikh `Abdu-r-Rahman, son of\r\nShaikh Abu-l-fazl, so as to bring it to 2,000 personal and (2,000)\r\nhorse. On Thursday, the 6th, I went to the throne-place of the late\r\nking Babar. As I was to leave Kabul on the next day I looked on that\r\nday as a feast day, and ordered them to arrange a wine-party on the\r\nspot, and fill with wine the little reservoir they had cut in the\r\nrock. Cups were given to all the courtiers and servants who were\r\npresent, and few days have passed in such enjoyment and pleasure. On\r\nFriday, the 7th, when a watch of day had passed, leaving the city\r\nauspiciously and with pleasure, a halt was made at the julgah\r\n(meadow) of the Safid-sang. From the Shahr-ara as far as the julgah\r\nI scattered to faqirs and poor people darb and charan, that is, half\r\nand quarter rupees. [234] On that day, when I mounted my elephant\r\nfor the purpose of leaving Kabul, the news arrived of the recovery\r\nof the Amiru-l-umara and Shah Beg Khan. The news of the good health\r\nof these two chief servants of mine I took as an auspicious omen for\r\nmyself. From the julgah of the Safid-sang, marching one kos on Tuesday,\r\nthe 11th, I halted at Bikram. I left Tash Beg Khan at Kabul to take\r\nproper care of Kabul and neighbourhood until the coming of Shah Beg\r\nKhan. On Tuesday, the 18th, I marched two and a half kos from the\r\nhalting-place of Butkhak by the road Du'aba, [235] and encamped\r\nat a spring on the bank of which there are four plane-trees. No\r\none till now had looked to the preparation of this halting-place,\r\nand they were ignorant of its condition and suitability. It is in\r\ntruth a most excellent spot, and one fit to have a building erected\r\nin it. At this halting-place another qamargah hunt took place, when\r\nabout 112 deer, etc., were taken. Twenty-four rang antelope and 50\r\nred antelope and 16 mountain goats were taken. I had never till now\r\nseen a rang antelope alive. [236] It is in truth a wonderful animal\r\nof a beautiful shape. Although the black buck of Hindustan looks very\r\nfinely made, the shape and fashion and appearance of this antelope is\r\nquite a different thing. They weighed a ram and a rang; the ram came to\r\na maund and 33 seers and the rang to two maunds and 10 seers. The rang,\r\nalthough of this size, ran so that ten or twelve swift dogs were worn\r\nout and seized it with a hundred thousand difficulties. The flesh of\r\nthe sheep of the Barbary goat in flavour does not surpass that of the\r\nrang. In the same village kulangs (demoiselle crane) were also caught.\r\n\r\nAlthough Khusrau had repeatedly done evil actions and deserved a\r\nthousand kinds of punishment, my fatherly affection did not permit me\r\nto take his life. Although in the laws of government and the ways of\r\nempire one should take notice of such disapproved deeds, I averted my\r\neyes from his faults, and kept him in excessive comfort and ease. It\r\nbecame known that he was in the habit of sending men to scoundrels who\r\ndid not consider consequences, and of inciting them to give trouble\r\nand attempt my life, and making them hopeful with promises. A band\r\nof these ill-fated ones of little foresight having joined together,\r\ndesired to attack me in the hunts that took place in Kabul and those\r\nparts. As the grace and protection of God Almighty are the guardians\r\nand keepers of this sublime dynasty, they did not attain to their\r\nend. On the day when the halt was at the Surkhab, one of that band\r\nwent at the risk of his life to Khwaja Waisi, the Diwan of my son\r\nKhurram, and revealed that nearly 500 men at Khusrau's instigation had\r\nconspired with Fathu-llah, son of Hakim Abu-l-fath, Nuru-d-din, son of\r\nGhiyasu-d-din `Ali Asaf-khan, and Sharif, son of I`timadu-d-daulah\r\n(Nur-Jahan's father), and were awaiting an opportunity to carry\r\nout the designs of the enemies and evil-wishers of the king. Khwaja\r\nWaisi told this to Khurram, and he in great perturbation immediately\r\ntold me. I gave Khurram the blessing of felicity, and prepared to\r\nget hold of the whole set of those short-sighted ones and punish\r\nthem with various kinds of punishment. Again, it came to my mind,\r\nas I was on the march, and the seizure of these people would create\r\na disturbance and confusion in the camp, [237] to order the leaders\r\nof the disturbance and mischief to be apprehended. I handed over\r\nFathu-llah in confinement to certain trusty men, and ordered capital\r\npunishment for the other two wretches, with three or four of the\r\nchief among the black-faced (conspirators). I had dignified Qasim\r\n`Ali, who was one of the servants of the late king Akbar, after my\r\naccession with the title of Dayanat Khan. He always accused Fathu-llah\r\nof a want of loyalty, and said things about him. One day he said to\r\nFathu-llah: \"At the time when Khusrau fled and the king pursued him,\r\nyou said to me: 'The Panjab should be given to Khusrau and this\r\nquarrel cut short.'\" Fathu-llah denied this, and both resorted to\r\noaths and curses (on themselves). Ten or fifteen days had not passed\r\nafter this altercation when that hypocritical wretch was arrested,\r\nand his false oath did its business.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, the 22nd Jumada-l-awwal, the news came of the death\r\nof the Hakim Jalalu-d-din Muzaffar Ardistani, who was of a family\r\nof skill and medicine and claimed to be a descendant of Galen. At\r\nall events he was an unequalled healer. His experience added to his\r\nknowledge. [238] As he was very handsome and well-made in the days\r\nof his youth (sada-ru'iha) [239] he frequented the assemblies of Shah\r\nTahmasp, and the king recited this hemistich about him:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"We have a pleasant physician: come, let as all be ill.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHakim `Ali, who was his contemporary, exceeded him in skill. In short,\r\nin medical skill and auspiciousness and rectitude and purity of method\r\nand disposition he was perfect. Other physicians of the age could\r\nnot compare with him. In addition to his medical skill he had many\r\nexcellencies. He had perfect loyalty towards me. He built at Lahore\r\na house of great pleasantness and purity, and repeatedly asked me to\r\nhonour it (with my presence). As I was very fond of pleasing him I\r\nconsented. In short, the aforesaid Hakim, from his connection with me\r\nand being my physician, had great skill in the management of affairs\r\nand business of the world, so that for some time at Allahabad I made\r\nhim Diwan of my establishment. On account of his great honesty he was\r\nvery exacting in important business, and people were vexed at this\r\nmethod of proceeding. For about twenty years he had ulcerated lungs,\r\nand by his wisdom preserved in some measure his health. When he was\r\ntalking he mostly coughed so much that his cheek and eyes became red,\r\nand by degrees his colour became blue. I often said to him: \"Thou\r\nart a learned physician; why dost thou not cure thy own wounds?\" He\r\nrepresented that wounds in the lungs were not of such a nature that\r\nthey could be cured. During his illness one of his confidential\r\nservants put poison into some medicine he was in the habit of\r\ntaking every day and gave it to him. When he perceived this he took\r\nremedies for it. He objected very much to be bled, although this was\r\nnecessary. It happened that he was going to the privy when his cough\r\novercame him and opened the wounds in his lungs. So much blood poured\r\nout of his mouth and brain that he became insensible and fell, and made\r\na fearful cry. An aftabachi (ewer-bearer) becoming aware of this, came\r\ninto the assembly-room, and seeing him smeared with blood cried out:\r\n\"They have killed the hakim.\" After examining him it was seen that\r\nthere was no sign of wounds on his body, and that it was the same\r\nwound in the lungs that had begun to flow. They informed Qilij Khan,\r\nwho was the Governor of Lahore, and he, having ascertained the true\r\nstate of the affair, buried him. He left no capable son.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th, between the garden of Wafa and Nimlah, a hunt took place,\r\nand nearly forty red antelope were killed. A female panther (yuz) fell\r\ninto our hands in this hunt. The zamindars of that place, Laghmanis,\r\nShali, and Afghans, came and said that they did not remember nor had\r\nthey heard from their fathers that a panther had been seen in that\r\nregion for 120 years. A halt was made on the 2nd Jumada-l-akhir, at\r\nthe Wafa Garden, and the assembly for the solar weighing was held. On\r\nthe same day Arslan Bi, an Uzbeg who was one of the Sardars and nobles\r\nof `Abdu-l-Mumin Khan, and was at that time governor of the fort of\r\nKahmard, having left his fort, had the blessing of waiting on me. As he\r\nhad come from friendship and sincerity, I exalted him with a special\r\nrobe of honour. He is a simple Uzbeg, and is fit to be educated and\r\nhonoured. On the 4th of the month an order was given that `Izzat Khan,\r\nthe governor [240] of Jalalabad, should make the hunting-ground of\r\nthe Arzina plain into a qamargah (ring-hunting ground). Nearly 300\r\nanimals were captured, namely, 35 quch (rams?), 25 qushqi (?), 90\r\narghali (wild sheep), 55 tughli (yaks?), 95 antelope (safida).\r\n\r\nAs it was the middle of the day when I arrived at the hunting-place and\r\nthe air was very hot, the (tazi) Arabian dogs had been exhausted. [241]\r\nThe time for running dogs is in the morning or at the end of the\r\nday. On Saturday, the 12th, the halt was at Akura Saray (?). At\r\nthis stage Shah Beg Khan, [242] with a good force, came and waited\r\non me. He was one who had been brought up by my father, the late king\r\nAkbar. In himself he is a very brave man and energetic, so much so that\r\nconstantly in the time of my father he fought several single combats,\r\nand in my own reign defended the fort of Qandahar from the hosts of the\r\nruler of Iran. It was besieged for a year before the royal army arrived\r\nto his assistance. His manners towards his soldiers are those of an\r\nAmir (nobleman, umarayana), and not according to discipline (qudrat),\r\nespecially towards those who have helped him in battles or are with\r\nhim in campaigns. He jokes much with his servants, and this gives him\r\nan undignified appearance. [243] I have repeatedly warned him about\r\nthis, but as it is in his nature my remonstrances have had no effect.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 14th, I promoted Hashim Khan, who is one of the\r\nhousehold, born ones of our dynasty, to the rank of 3,000 with 2,000\r\nhorse, and I made him governor of the province of Orissa. On the\r\nsame day news came that Badi`u-z-zaman, son of Mirza Shahrukh, who\r\nwas in the province of Malwa, through folly and youth had started\r\nwith a body of rebels to go to the province of the Rana and join\r\nhim. `Abdu-llah Khan, the governor of that place, being informed of\r\nthis event went after him, and having made him prisoner on the way,\r\nslew several of the wretches who had joined with him. An order was\r\ngiven that Ihtimam Khan should start from Agra and bring the Mirza to\r\nthe court. On the 25th of the aforesaid month news came that Imam Quli\r\nKhan, nephew of Wali Khan, ruler of Mawara'a-n-nahr, had killed him\r\nwho was called Mirza Husain, who had been reported to be the son of\r\nMirza Shahrukh. In truth, the killing of the sons of Mirza Shahrukh\r\nis like the killing of the demons, as they say that from every drop\r\nof their blood demons are produced. In the station of Dhaka, Shir\r\nKhan, the Afghan, whom when I left I had placed at Peshawar to guard\r\nthe Khaibar Pass, came and waited on me. He had made no default in\r\npreserving and guarding the road. Zafar Khan, son of Zain Khan Koka,\r\nhad been appointed to move on the Dalazak Afghans and the tribe of\r\nKhatur, who had perpetrated all kinds of misdeeds in the neighbourhood\r\nof Attock and the Beas and that vicinity. After performing that service\r\nand the conquest of those rebels, who numbered about 100,000 houses,\r\nand sending them off towards Lahore, he came and waited upon me at\r\nthe same halting-place, and it was evident that he had performed\r\nthat service as it ought to have been done. As the month of Rajab,\r\ncorresponding with the Ilahi month of Aban, had arrived, [244] and\r\nit was known that this was one of the months fixed for the lunar\r\nweighing (wazn-i-qamari) of my father, I determined that the value of\r\nall the articles which he used to order for his own weighing in the\r\nsolar and lunar years should be estimated, and that what this came\r\nto should be sent to the large cities for the repose of the soul of\r\nthat enlightened one, and be divided amongst the necessitous and the\r\nfaqirs. The total came to 100,000 rupees, equal to 300 Iraq tumans,\r\nand 300,000 of the currency of the people of Mawara'a-n-nahr.\r\n\r\nTrustworthy men divided that sum among the twelve chief cities,\r\nsuch as Agra, Delhi, Lahore, Gujarat (Ahmadabad), etc. On Thursday,\r\nthe 3rd Rajab, I favoured with the title of Khan-jahan my son\r\n(farzand) Salabat Khan, who is not less to me than my own sons,\r\nand ordered that they should in all firmans and orders write of him\r\nas Khan-jahan. A special robe of honour and a jewelled sword were\r\nalso given him. Also, having entitled Shah Beg Khan Khan-dauran,\r\nI presented him with a jewelled waist-dagger, a male elephant, and\r\na special horse. The whole of the sarkars of Tirah, Kabul, Bangash,\r\nand the province of Sawad (Swat) Bajaur, with the (task of) beating\r\nback the Afghans of those regions, and a jagir and the faujdarship\r\nwere confirmed to him. He took leave from Baba Hasan Abdal. I also\r\nordered Ram Das Kachhwaha to receive a jagir in this province and to\r\nbe enrolled among the auxiliaries of this Subah. I conferred on Kishan\r\nChand, son of the Mota (fat) Raja, the rank of 1,000 personal and 500\r\nhorse. A firman was written to Murtaza Khan (Sayyid Farid), governor\r\nof Gujarat, that as the good conduct and excellence and abstemiousness\r\nof the son of Miyan Wajihu-d-din [245] had been reported to me, he\r\nshould hand over to him from me a sum of money, and that he should\r\nwrite and send me some of the names of God which had been tested. If\r\nthe grace of God should be with me I would continually repeat [246]\r\nthem. Before this I had given leave to Zafar Khan to go to Baba Hasan\r\nAbdal to collect together game for sport. He had made a shakhband\r\n(literally a tying together of horns or branches). Twenty-seven red\r\ndeer and 68 white ones came into the shakhband. I myself struck with\r\narrows 29 antelope, and Parwiz and Khurram also killed some others with\r\narrows. Afterwards orders were given to the servants and courtiers\r\nto shoot. Khan Jahan was the best shot, and in every case of his\r\nstriking an antelope the arrow penetrated through and through. [247]\r\nAgain, on the 14th of the month of Rajab, Zafar Khan had arranged a\r\nqamargah at Rawalpindi. I struck with an arrow a red deer at a long\r\ndistance, and was highly delighted at the arrow striking him and his\r\nfalling down. Thirty-four red deer and 35 qara-quyrugh (black-tailed)\r\nantelope, which in the Hindi language they call chikara, and two pigs\r\nwere also killed. On the 21st another qamargah had been arranged within\r\nthree kos of the fort of Rohtas by the efforts and exertions of Hilal\r\nKhan. I had taken with me to this hunt those who were screened by the\r\ncurtains of honour (the members of the zananah). The hunt was a good\r\none and came off with great éclat. Two hundred red and white antelope\r\nwere killed. Passing on from Rohtas, the hills of which contain these\r\nantelope, there are in no place in the whole of Hindustan, with the\r\nexception of Girjhak and Nandanah, red deer of this description. I\r\nordered them to catch and keep some of them alive, in order that\r\npossibly some of them might reach Hindustan for breeding purposes. On\r\nthe 25th another hunt took place in the neighbourhood of Rohtas. In\r\nthis hunt also my sisters and the other ladies were with me, and\r\nnearly 100 red deer were killed. It was told me that Shams Khan,\r\nuncle of Jalal Khan [248] Gakkhar who was in that neighbourhood,\r\nnotwithstanding his great age took much delight in hunting, such\r\nthat young men had not so much enjoyment in it. When I heard that he\r\nwas well-disposed towards faqirs and dervishes I went to his house,\r\nand his disposition and manners pleased me. I bestowed on him 2,000\r\nrupees, and the same sum on his wives and children, with five other\r\nvillages with large receipts by way of livelihood for them, that they\r\nmight pass their days in comfort and contentment. On the 6th Sha`ban,\r\nat the halting-place of Chandalah, the Amiru-l-umara came and waited on\r\nme. I was greatly pleased at obtaining his society again, for all the\r\nphysicians, Hindu and Musulman, had made up their minds that he would\r\ndie. Almighty God in His grace and mercy granted him the honour of\r\nrecovery, in order that it might be known to such as do not recognize\r\nHis will that for every difficult ill, which those who look on the\r\noutside of causes only may have given up as hopeless, there is One\r\nwho is powerful to provide a cure and remedy out of His own kindness\r\nand compassion. On the same day Ray Ray Singh, [249] one of the most\r\nconsiderable of the Rajput Amirs, ashamed on account of the fault he\r\nhad committed in the matter of Khusrau, and who was living at his home,\r\ncame, and under the patronage of the Amiru-l-umara obtained the good\r\nfortune of waiting on me; his offences were pardoned. At the time that\r\nI left Agra in pursuit of Khusrau I had in full confidence left him\r\nin charge of Agra, so that when the ladies (mahalha) [250] should be\r\nsent for he might come with them. After the ladies were sent for he\r\nwent for two or three stages with them, and in the village of Mathura,\r\non merely hearing foolish tales, separated from them, and went to his\r\nnative place (Bikanir). He thought that as a commotion had arisen he\r\nwould see where the right road was. The merciful God, who cherishes\r\nHis servants, in a short time having arranged that affair broke the\r\nrope of the alliance of those rebels, and this betrayal of his salt\r\nremained a burden on his neck. In order to please the Amiru-l-umara\r\nI ordered the rank which he formerly held to be confirmed to him,\r\nand his jagir to remain as it was. I promoted Sulaiman Beg, who was\r\none of my attendants from the time when I was prince, to the title\r\nof Fida'i Khan. On Monday, the 12th, a halt was made at the garden\r\nof Dil-amiz, which is on the bank of the river Ravi. I waited on my\r\nmother in this garden. Mirza Ghazi, who had done approved service in\r\ncommand of the army at Qandahar, waited on me, and I bestowed great\r\nfavour on him.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the 13th, I auspiciously entered Lahore. The next day\r\nMir Khalilu-llah, son of Ghiyasu-d-din Muhammad, Mirmiran, who was of\r\nthe descendants of Shah Ni`matu-llah Wali, paid his respects. [251]\r\nIn the reign of Shah Tahmasp there was no family of such greatness in\r\nthe whole country, for the sister of the Shah, by name Janish Begam,\r\nwas in the house of (married to) Mir Ni`matu-llah, the father of the\r\nMirmiran. A daughter who was born to them, the Shah gave in marriage\r\nto his own son Isma`il Mirza, and making the sons of that Mirmiran\r\nsons-in-law, gave his younger daughter to his eldest son, who had the\r\nsame name as his grandfather, and connected (in marriage) the daughter\r\nof Isma`il Mirza, who was born of the niece of the Shah, to another\r\nson, Mir Khalilu-llah. After the death of the Shah, by degrees the\r\nfamily went to decay, until in the reign of Shah `Abbas they became all\r\nat once extirpated, and they lost the property and effects that they\r\nhad and could no longer remain in their own place. Mir Khalilu-llah\r\ncame to wait upon me. As he had undergone trouble on the road, and\r\nthe signs of sincerity were apparent from his circumstances, having\r\nmade him a sharer of my unstinted favours I gave him 12,000 rupees in\r\ncash, and promoted him to the rank of 1,000 personal and 200 horse,\r\nand gave an order for a jagir.\r\n\r\nAn order was given to the civil department (diwaniyan) to confer\r\nthe rank of 8,000 personal and 5,000 horse on my son Khurram, and\r\nto provide a jagir for him in the neighbourhood of Ujjain, and to\r\nassign the Sarkar of Hisar Firuza to him. On Thursday, the 22nd, on\r\nthe invitation of Asaf Khan, I went with my ladies to his house and\r\npassed the night there. The next day he presented before me his own\r\nofferings, of the value of ten lacs of rupees, in jewels and jewelled\r\nthings, robes, elephants, and horses. Some single rubies and jacinths\r\nand some pearls, also silk cloths with some pieces of porcelain from\r\nChina and Tartary, were accepted, and I made a present of the rest to\r\nhim. Murtaza Khan from Gujarat sent by way of offering a ring made\r\nof a single ruby of good colour, substance, and water, the stone,\r\nthe socket, and the ring being all of one piece. They weighed 1 1/2\r\ntanks and one surkh, which is equal to one misqal and 15 surkh. This\r\nwas sent to me and much approved. Till that day no one had ever\r\nheard of such a ring having come to the hands of any sovereign. A\r\nsingle ruby weighing six surkhs or two tanks and 15 surkhs, [252]\r\nand of which the value was stated to be £25,000, was also sent. The\r\nring was valued at the same figure.\r\n\r\nOn the same day the envoy of the Sharif of Mecca came to wait on\r\nme with a letter and the curtain of the door of the Ka`bah. He\r\nshowed great friendship towards me. The said envoy had bestowed on\r\nhim 500,000 dam, equal to 7,000 or 8,000 rupees, and I resolved to\r\nsend the Sharif the equivalent of 100,000 rupees of the precious\r\nthings of Hindustan. On Thursday, the 10th of the month, a piece\r\nof the Subah of Multan was added to the jagir of Mirza Ghazi,\r\nthough the whole of the province of Thattah had been given to him in\r\njagir. He was also promoted to the rank of 5,000 personalty and 5,000\r\nhorse. The government of Qandahar and the protection of that region,\r\nwhich is the frontier of Hindustan, were assigned to his excellent\r\nadministration. Conferring on him a robe of honour and a jewelled\r\nsword I gave him his leave. In fine, Mirza Ghazi possessed perfection,\r\n[253] and he made also good verses. He used Waqari as his takhallus, or\r\npoetic name (Ruz-i-rushan, Bhopal 1297, p. 455; also Ma'asiru-l-umara,\r\nvol. iii, p. 347). This is one of his couplets:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"If my weeping should cause her to smile, what wonder?\r\n    Though the cloud weep, the cheek of the rose-bush smiles.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 15th the offering of the Khankhanan was presented to me: 40\r\nelephants, some jewelled and decorated vessels, some Persian robes, and\r\ncloth that they make in the Deccan and those parts, had been sent by\r\nhim, altogether of the value of 150,000 rupees. Mirza Rustam and most\r\nof the office-holders of that Subah had also sent good offerings. Some\r\nof the elephants were approved. News of the death of Ray Durga, [254]\r\nwho was one of those who had been brought up by my revered father,\r\narrived on the 18th of the month. He had been in attendance for forty\r\nyears and more in the position of an Amir on my revered father, until,\r\nby degrees, he had risen in rank to 4,000. Before he obtained the good\r\nfortune of waiting on my father he was one of the trusted servants\r\nof Rana Uday Singh. He died on the 29th. He was a good military\r\nman. Sultan Shah, the Afghan, whose disposition was turbulent and\r\nmischievous, passed his time in the service of Khusrau, and had his\r\ncomplete intimacy, so much so that this rebel was the cause of the\r\nrunning away of that unfortunate one. After the defeat and capture\r\nof Khusrau he went off alone(?) [255] into the skirts of the hills of\r\nKhizrabad and that region. At last he was made prisoner by Mir Mughal,\r\nthe karori of that place. As he had been the cause of the destruction\r\nand ruin of such a son, I ordered them to shoot him with arrows on\r\nthe plain of Lahore. The aforesaid karori was promoted to higher rank,\r\nand was dignified with a grand dress of honour. On the 29th Shir Khan,\r\nthe Afghan, who was one of my old servants, died. One might say that\r\nhe took his own life, because he was continually drinking wine, to\r\nthe extent that in every watch he used to drink four brimming cups\r\nof arrack of double strength. He had broken the fast of the Ramazan\r\nof the past year, and took it into his head this year that he would\r\nfast in the month of Sha`ban on account of his having broken the fast\r\nof Ramazan, and would fast for two months together. In abandoning\r\nhis usual custom, which is a second nature, he became weak and his\r\nappetite left him, and becoming very weak he passed away in his\r\n57th year. Patronising his children and brothers according to their\r\ncircumstances, I bestowed on them a portion of his rank and jagir.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of the month of Shawwal I went to visit Maulana Muhammad\r\nAmin, who was one of the disciples of Shaikh Mahmud Kamangar (the\r\nbow-maker). The Shaikh Mahmud [256] mentioned was one of the great men\r\nof his age, and H.M. Humayun had entire reliance on him, so much so\r\nthat he once poured water on his hands. The aforesaid Maulana is a man\r\nof good disposition, and is free, notwithstanding the attachments and\r\naccidents (of the world), a faqir in manner and ways, and acquainted\r\nwith brokenness of spirit. His company pleased me exceedingly. I\r\nexplained to him some of the griefs that had entangled themselves\r\nin my mind and heard from him good advice and agreeable words, and\r\nfound myself greatly consoled at heart. Having presented him with\r\n1,000 bigha and 1,000 rupees in cash by way of maintenance, I took\r\nleave. One watch of day had passed on Sunday when I left Lahore on\r\nmy way to the capital of Agra. Having made Qilij Khan governor, Mir\r\nQawamu-d-din diwan, Shaikh Yusuf bakhshi, and Jamalu-d-din kotwal,\r\nand presented each according to his circumstances with dresses of\r\nhonour, I turned towards my desired way. On the 25th, having passed\r\nover the river at Sultanpur, I proceeded two kos and halted at\r\nNakodar. My revered father had given Shaikh Abu-l-fazl [257] gold of\r\nthe weight of 20,000 rupees to build an embankment between these two\r\nparganahs and prepare a waterfall, and in truth I found a halting-place\r\nexceedingly pleasant and fresh. I ordered Mu`izzu-l-mulk, the jagirdar\r\nof Nakodar, to erect a building and prepare a garden on one side of\r\nthis embankment, so that wayfarers seeing it might be pleased. On\r\nSaturday, 10th Zi-l-qa`da, Waziru-l-mulk, who before my ascension\r\nhad the good fortune to serve me, and was Diwan of my establishment,\r\ndied of diarrhoea. At the end of his life a son of evil fortune (lit\r\nfootsteps) had been born in his house, who in the space of forty days\r\nruined [258] (Erskine has 'ate') both his father and mother, and who\r\nhimself died when he was two or three years old. It occurred to me\r\nthat the house of Waziru-l-mulk must not all at once be ruined, and\r\npatronising Mansur, his brother's son, I gave him rank. Indeed, [259]\r\nhe showed no love to me (the scent of love did not come from him). On\r\nMonday, the 14th, I heard on the road that between Panipat and Karnal\r\nthere were two tigers that were giving much trouble to wayfarers. I\r\ncollected the elephants and sent them off. When I arrived at their\r\n(the tigers') place I mounted a female elephant, and ordered them\r\nto place the elephants round them after the manner of a qamargah\r\n(enclosure), and by the favour of Allah killed both with a gun,\r\nand thus got rid of the raging tigers that had closed the road to\r\nthe servants of God. On Thursday, the 18th, [260] I halted at Delhi\r\nand alighted at the residence which Salim Khan, the Afghan, had made\r\nin the days of his rule in the middle of the river Jumna and called\r\nSalimgadh. My revered father had given the place to Murtaza Khan, who\r\nwas originally an inhabitant of Delhi. The aforesaid Khan had built\r\non the margin of the river a terrace of stone excessively pleasant\r\nand bright. Below that building [261] near the water there was made a\r\nsquare chaukandi with glazed tiles by the order of H.M. Humayun, and\r\nthere are few places with such air. In the days when the late king\r\nHumayun honoured Delhi with his presence, he often sat there with\r\nhis intimates, and associated with the members of his assemblies. I\r\npassed four days in that place, and with my courtiers and intimates\r\nenjoyed myself with wine parties. Mu`azzam Khan, who was governor\r\nof Delhi, presented offerings. The jagirdars and citizens also made\r\nofferings and presents, each according to his circumstances. I was\r\ndesirous to employ some days in a qamargah hunt in the parganah of\r\nPalam, which is one of the places near the aforesaid city and one\r\nof the fixed hunting-grounds. As it was represented to me that the\r\n(fortunate) hour for approaching Agra had come very near, and another\r\nproper hour was not to be obtained at all near that time, I gave up\r\nthe intention, and embarking on board a boat went on by water. On\r\nthe 20th of the month of Zi-l-qa`da four boys and three girls,\r\nchildren of Mirza Shahrukh, whom he had not mentioned to my father,\r\nwere brought. I placed the boys among my confidential servants, and\r\nmade over the girls to the attendants of the ladies of the harem in\r\norder that they might look after them. On the 21st of the same month\r\nRaja Man Singh came and waited on me from the fort of Rohtas, which\r\nis in the province of Patna and Behar, after orders had been sent\r\nto him six or seven times. He also, like Khan A`zam, is one of the\r\nhypocrites and old wolves of this State. What they have done to me,\r\nand what has happened to them from me, God the knower of secrets knows;\r\npossibly no one could mention such another case(?). The aforesaid\r\nRaja produced as offerings 100 elephants, male and female, not one\r\nof which was fit to be included among my private elephants. As he was\r\none of those who had been favoured by my father, I did not parade his\r\noffences before his face, but with royal condescension promoted him.\r\n\r\nOn this day they brought a talking jal (lark) which distinctly said\r\n\"Miyan Tuti.\" It was very strange and wonderful. In Turki they call\r\nthis bird turghai. [262]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD NEW YEAR'S FEAST FROM MY ACCESSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the 2nd Zi-l-hijja, corresponding with the 1st Farwardin\r\n(19th March, 1608), the Sun, which enlightens and heats the world with\r\nits splendour, changed from the constellation of Pisces to the joyful\r\nmansion of Aries, the abode of pleasure and rejoicing. It gave the\r\nworld fresh brightness, and being aided by the Spring clothed those\r\nwho had been plundered by the cold season, and tyrannised over by the\r\nAutumn, with the robes of honour of the New Year and the garments of\r\nemerald green, and gave them compensation and recuperation.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Again to Not-Being came the world's lord's order,\r\n   'Restore what thou hast devoured.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe feast of the New Year was held in the village of Rankatta, [263]\r\nwhich is five kos off (from Agra), and at the time of transit (of\r\nthe sun) I seated myself on the throne with glory and gladness. The\r\nnobles and courtiers and all the servants came forward with their\r\ncongratulations. In the same assembly I bestowed on Khanjahan the rank\r\nof 5,000 personal and horse. I selected Khwaja Jahan for the post of\r\nbakhshi. Dismissing Wazir Khan from the Viziership of the province of\r\nBengal, I sent in his place Abu-l-hasan Shihabkhani; and Nuru-d-din\r\nQuli became kotwal of Agra. As the glorious mausoleum of the late\r\nking Akbar was on the road, it entered my mind that if in passing by I\r\nshould have the good fortune of a pilgrimage to it, it might occur to\r\nthose who were short-sighted that I visited it because it was the place\r\nwhere my road crossed. I accordingly had determined that this time I\r\nwould enter Agra, and after that would go on foot on this pilgrimage\r\nto the shrine, which is two and a half kos off, in the same way that\r\nthe Hazrat (my father), on account of my birth, had gone from Agra to\r\nAjmir. Would that I might also traverse the same on my head! When two\r\nwatches of day had passed of Saturday, the 5th [264] of the month,\r\nat an auspicious hour, I returned towards Agra, and scattering with\r\ntwo hands 5000 rupees in small coins on the way, entered the august\r\npalace which was inside the fort. On this day Raja Bir Singh Deo\r\nbrought a white cheeta to show me. Although other sorts of creatures,\r\nboth birds and beasts, have white varieties, which they call tuyghan,\r\n[265] I had never seen a white cheeta. Its spots, which are (usually)\r\nblack, were of a blue colour, and the whiteness of the body was also\r\ninclined to bluishness. Of the albino animals that I have seen there\r\nare falcons, sparrow-hawks, hawks (shikara) that they call bigu [266]\r\nin the Persian language, sparrows, crows, partridges, florican, podna\r\n[267] (Sylvia olivacea), and peacocks. Many hawks in aviaries are\r\nalbinos. I have also seen white flying mice (flying squirrels) and\r\nsome albinos among the black antelope, which is a species found only\r\nin Hindustan. Among the chikara (gazelle), which they call safida in\r\nPersia, I have frequently seen albinos. At this time Ratan, son of\r\nBhoj-hara, who is one of the chief Rajput nobles, came to the camp\r\nand waited on me, bringing three elephants as an offering. One of\r\nthese was much approved, and they valued it in the office at 15,000\r\nrupees. It was entered among my private elephants, and I gave it the\r\nname of Ratangaj. The value of elephants of the former great Rajas of\r\nIndia was not more than 25,000 rupees, but they have now become very\r\ndear. I dignified Ratan with the title of Sarbuland Ray. I promoted\r\nMiran Sadr Jahan to the rank of 5,000 personal and 1,500 horse and\r\nMu`azzam Khan to 4,000 personal and 2,000 horse. `Abdu-llah Khan was\r\npromoted to 3,000 and 500 horse. Muzaffar Khan and Bhao Singh each\r\nobtained the rank of 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse. Abu-l-hasan diwan\r\nhad 1,000 and 500 horse. I`timadu-d-daulah that of 1,000 personal and\r\n250 horse. On the 25th Raja Suraj Singh, the maternal uncle of my son\r\nKhurram, came and paid his respects to me. He brought with him Shyam,\r\nthe cousin of the turbulent Umra. In truth he possesses some skill and\r\nunderstands well how to ride elephants. Raja Suraj Singh had brought\r\nwith him a poet who wrote verse in the Hindi tongue. He laid before me\r\na poem in my praise to the purport that if the Sun had a son it would\r\nbe always day and never would be night, because after his setting that\r\nson would sit in his place and keep the world in light. Praise and\r\nthanksgiving to God that God gave your father such a son that after\r\nhis death men should not wear mourning which is like the night. The Sun\r\nhad envy on this account, saying, \"Would I might also have a son who,\r\ntaking my place, should not allow night to approach the world, for\r\nfrom the light of your rising and the illumination of your justice,\r\nnotwithstanding such a misfortune, the spheres are so bright that\r\none might say 'night had neither name nor sign.'\" Few Hindi verses of\r\nsuch freshness of purport have ever reached my ear. As a reward for\r\nthis eulogy I gave him an elephant. The Rajputs call a poet Charan\r\n(name of a caste who are many of them poets). One of the poets of\r\nthe age has turned [268] these sentiments into (Persian) verse--\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"If the world-illuminator had a son,\r\n        There would be no night; it would be always day;\r\n        For when his gold-crowned head was hidden\r\n        His son would display his tiara peak.\r\n        Thanks that after such a father\r\n        Such a son sits in his place.\r\n        For from the demise of that king\r\n        No one made black robes for mourning.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the 8th Muharram, 1017 [269] (24th April, 1608),\r\nJalalu-d-din Mas`ud, who held the rank of 400 personal and was\r\nnot wanting in bravery, and who in several battles had done great\r\ndeeds, died at about the age of 50 or 60 years of diarrhoea. He was\r\nan opium-eater, and used to eat opium after breaking it in pieces,\r\nlike cheese, and it is notorious that he frequently ate opium from the\r\nhand of his own mother. When his disease became violent and there was\r\na prospect of his death, his mother from excessive love for him ate\r\nmore opium than was right out of that which she used to give her son,\r\nand two or three hours after his death she also died. I have never\r\nheard of such affection on the part of a mother for her son. It is\r\nthe custom among the Hindus that after the death of their husbands\r\nwomen burn themselves, whether from love, or to save the honour\r\nof their fathers, or from being ashamed before their sons-in-law,\r\nbut nothing like this was ever manifested on the part of mothers,\r\nMusulman or Hindu. On the 15th of the same month I presented my best\r\nhorse by way of favour to Raja Man Singh. Shah `Abbas had sent this\r\nhorse with some other horses and fitting gifts by Minuchihr, one of\r\nhis confidential slaves, to the late king Akbar. From being presented\r\nwith this horse the Raja was so delighted that if I had given him\r\na kingdom I do not think he would have shown such joy. At the time\r\nthey brought the horse it was three or four years old. It grew up\r\nin Hindustan. The whole of the servants of the Court, Moghul and\r\nRajput together, represented that no horse like this had ever come\r\nfrom Iraq to Hindustan. When my revered father gave the province of\r\nKhandesh and the Subah of the Deccan to my brother Daniyal, and was\r\nreturning to Agra, he by way of kindness told Daniyal to ask of him\r\nwhatever he desired. Seizing the opportunity, he asked for this horse,\r\nand he accordingly gave it to him. On Tuesday, the 20th, a report came\r\nfrom Islam Khan with the news of the death of Jahangir Quli Khan, the\r\ngovernor of the Subah of Bengal, who was my special slave. On account\r\nof his natural excellence and innate merit he had been enrolled in the\r\nlist of the great Amirs. I was much grieved at his death. I bestowed\r\nthe rule of Bengal and the tutorship to Prince Jahandar on my farzand\r\n[270] Islam Khan, and in his place gave the government of the Subah\r\nof Behar to Afzal Khan (son of Abu-l-fazl). The son of Hakim `Ali,\r\nwhom I had sent on some duties to Burhanpur, came and brought with him\r\nsome Karnatic jugglers who had no rivals or equals; for instance, one\r\nof them played with ten balls, each of which was equal to an orange\r\nand one to a citron, and one to a surkh, [271] in such a way that\r\nnotwithstanding some were small and some large he never missed one,\r\nand did so many kinds of tricks that one's wits became bewildered. At\r\nthe same time a dervish from Ceylon came and brought a strange animal\r\ncalled a deonak [272] (or devang). Its face was exactly like a large\r\nbat, and the whole shape was like that of a monkey, but it had no\r\ntail. Its movements were like those of the black tailless monkey which\r\nthey call ban manush (jungle man) in the Hindi language. Its body was\r\nlike that of a young monkey two or three months old. It had been with\r\nthe dervish for five years. [273] It appeared that the animal would\r\nnever grow larger. Its food is milk and it also eats plantains. As\r\nthe creature appeared very strange, I ordered the artists to take a\r\nlikeness of it in various kinds of movement. It looked very ugly.\r\n\r\nOn the same day Mirza Faridun Barlas was promoted to the rank of 1,500\r\npersonal and 1,300 horse. An order was given that Payanda [274] Khan\r\nMoghul, as he had reached old age after exerting himself as a soldier,\r\nshould receive a jagir equal to 2,000 personal. Ilf Khan was promoted\r\nto the rank of 700 personal and 500 horse. The rank of Islam Khan, my\r\nson (farzand), the governor of the Subah of Bengal, was fixed at 4,000\r\npersonal and 3,000 horse. The guardianship of the fort of Rohtas was\r\nbestowed on Kishwar Khan, son of Qutbu-d-din Khan Koka. Ihtimam Khan\r\nwas raised to the rank of 1,000 personal and 300 horse, and made mir\r\nbahr (admiral) and was appointed to the charge of the nawara (fleet)\r\nof Bengal. On the 1st Safar Shamsu-d-din Khan, son of Khan A`zam,\r\nmade an offering of ten elephants, and, receiving the rank of 2,000\r\npersonal and 1,500 horse, was selected for the title of Jahangir Quli\r\nKhan, and Zafar Khan received the rank of 2,000 personal and 1,000\r\nhorse. As I had demanded in marriage the daughter of Jagat Singh,\r\neldest son of Raja Man Singh, I on the 16th sent 80,000 rupees for\r\nthe sachaq (a marriage present) to the house of the aforesaid Raja\r\nin order to dignify him. Muqarrab Khan sent from the port of Cambay\r\na European curtain (tapestry), the like of which in beauty no other\r\nwork of the Frank painters had ever been seen. On the same day my\r\naunt, Najibu-n-nisa Begam, [275] died in the 61st year of her age\r\nof the disease of consumption and hectic fever. I promoted her son,\r\nMirza Wali, to the rank of 1,000 personal and 200 horse. A man of\r\nMawara'a-n-nahr, of the name of Aqam Haji, who for a long time had been\r\nin Turkey and was not without reasonableness and religious knowledge,\r\nand who called himself the ambassador of the Turkish Emperor,\r\nwaited upon me at Agra. He had an unknown writing (? illegible\r\nletter). Looking to his circumstances and his proceedings none of\r\nthe servants of the Court believed in his being an ambassador. When\r\nTimur conquered Turkey, and Yildirim Bayazid, the ruler of that place,\r\nfell alive into his hands, he, after levying tribute and taking one\r\nyear's revenue, determined to hand back into his possession the whole\r\nof the country of Turkey. Just at that time Yildirim Bayazid died,\r\nand (Timur), having handed over the kingdom to his son Musa Chelebi,\r\nreturned. From that time until now, notwithstanding such favours,\r\nno one had come on the part of the emperors, nor has any ambassador\r\nbeen sent: how, then, can it now be believed that this person from\r\nMawara'a-n-nahr should have been sent by the emperor? I could in\r\nno way understand the affair, and no one could bear witness to the\r\naccuracy of his claim: I therefore told him to go wherever he might\r\nwish. On the 4th Rabi`u-1-awwal the daughter of Jagat Singh entered\r\nthe harem, and the marriage ceremony was performed in the house of\r\nHer Highness Maryam-zamani. Amongst the things sent with her by Raja\r\nMan Singh were 60 elephants.\r\n\r\nAs I had determined to conquer the Rana, it occurred to me that I\r\nshould send Mahabat Khan. I appointed 12,000 fully armed cavalry\r\nunder able officers to go with him, and in addition 500 ahadis,\r\n2,000 musketeers on foot, with artillery made up of 70 to 80 guns\r\nmounted on elephants and camels; 60 elephants were appointed to this\r\nduty. Two million rupees of treasure were ordered to be sent with this\r\narmy. On the 16th of the said month Mir Khalilu-llah, grandson of Mir\r\nNi`matu-llah Yazdi, the whole of whose circumstances and family history\r\nhas already been written, died of diarrhoea. In his appearance the\r\ntraces of sincerity and dervishhood were manifest. If he had lived\r\nand passed a long time in my service he would have risen to high\r\nrank. The bakhshi of Burhanpur had sent some mangoes, one of which\r\nI ordered to be weighed; it came to 52 1/2 tolas. On Wednesday, the\r\n18th, in the house of Maryam-zamani, the feast of the lunar weighing\r\nof my 40th year was held. I ordered the money used in weighing to\r\nbe divided amongst women and needy persons. On Thursday, the 4th\r\nRabi`u-l-akhir, Tahir Beg, the bakhshi of the Ahadis, was given the\r\ntitle of Mukhlis Khan, and Mulla-i-Taqiyya Shustari, [276] who was\r\nadorned with excellencies and perfections, and was well acquainted\r\nwith the science of history and genealogy, that of Mu'arrikh Khan. On\r\nthe 10th of the same month, having given Barkhurdar, the brother of\r\n`Abdu-llah Khan, the title of Bahadur Khan, I dignified him among his\r\nfellows. Munis Khan, son of Mihtar Khan, presented me with a jug of\r\njasper (jade), which had been made in the reign of Mirza Ulugh Beg\r\nGurgan, in the honoured name of that prince. It was a very delicate\r\nrarity and of a beautiful shape. Its stone was exceedingly white and\r\npure. Around the neck of the jar they had carved the auspicious name\r\nof the Mirza and the Hijra year in riqa` [277] characters. I ordered\r\nthem to inscribe my name and the auspicious name of Akbar on the edge\r\nof the lip of the jar. Mihtar [278] Khan was one of the ancient slaves\r\nof this State. He had the honour of serving the late king Humayun,\r\nand during the reign of my revered father had attained the rank of\r\nnobility. He regarded him as one of his confidential servants. On\r\nthe 16th a firman was issued that the country of Sangram, [279]\r\nwhich had been given for a year by way of reward to my son (farzand)\r\nIslam Khan, should be handed over for the same purpose for a year\r\nto Afzal Khan, the governor of the Subah of Behar. On this day I\r\npromoted Mahabat Khan to the rank of 3,000 personal and 2,500 horse,\r\nand Yusuf Khan, son of Husain Khan Tukriyah, obtained that of 2,000\r\npersonal and 800 horse. On the 24th I gave leave to Mahabat Khan\r\nand the Amirs and men who had been appointed to subdue the Rana. The\r\naforesaid Khan was honoured with a robe of honour, a horse, a special\r\nelephant, and a jewelled sword. Zafar Khan, having been honoured\r\nwith a standard, was presented with a private robe of honour and a\r\njewelled dagger. Shaja`at Khan also was presented with a standard,\r\nand I gave him a robe of honour and a special elephant. Raja Bir\r\nSingh Deo received a robe of honour and a special horse, and Mangli\r\nKhan a horse and jewelled dagger. Narayan Das Kachhwahah, `Ali Quli\r\nDarman, and Hizabr Khan Tahamtan obtained leave. On Bahadur Khan and\r\nMu`izzu-l-mulk the bakhshi jewelled daggers were conferred, and in\r\nthe same manner all the Amirs and leaders, each one according to his\r\ndegree, were honoured with royal gifts. A watch of the day had passed\r\nwhen the Khankhanan, who had been selected for the high honour of my\r\nAtaliq (guardian), came from Burhanpur and waited on me. Delight and\r\nhappiness had so overpowered him that he did not know whether he came\r\non his head or his feet. He threw himself bewildered at my feet. By way\r\nof favour and kindness I lifted up his head and held it in an embrace\r\nof kindliness and affection, and kissed his face. He brought me as\r\nofferings two strings of pearls and some rubies and emeralds. The\r\nvalue of the jewels was 300,000 rupees. Besides these he laid before\r\nme many valuable things. On the 17th Jumada-l-awwal Wazir Khan, the\r\nDiwan of Bengal, came and waited on me, and offered 60 elephants,\r\nmale and female, and one Egyptian [280] ruby. As he was one of the\r\nold servants and he performed every duty, I ordered him to remain in\r\nattendance on me. As Qasim Khan and his elder brother, Islam Khan,\r\ncould in no way keep the peace together, I had sent for the former to\r\nmy own presence, and he yesterday came and waited on me. On the 22nd,\r\nAsaf Khan, made me an offering of a ruby of the weight of seven tank,\r\nwhich Abu-l-qasim, his brother, had bought in the port of Cambay\r\nfor 75,000 rupees. It is of a beautiful colour and well-shaped,\r\nbut to my belief is not worth more than 60,000 rupees. Great faults\r\nhad been committed by Dulip Ray, son of Ray Ray Singh, but as he\r\ntook refuge with my farzand Khan Jahan his offences were pardoned,\r\nand I knowingly and purposely passed over his delinquencies. On the\r\n24th the sons of Khankhanan, who had followed after him, arrived and\r\nwaited on me and produced as an offering the sum of 25,000 rupees. On\r\nthe same day the said Khan offered 90 elephants. On Thursday, the\r\n1st Jumada-s-sani, the feast of my solar year was celebrated in the\r\nhouse of Maryam-zamani. Some of the money I divided among the women,\r\nand an order was given that the balance should be distributed to the\r\npoor of the hereditary kingdoms. On the 4th of the month I ordered\r\nthe Diwans to give a jagir, according to his rank, of 7,000 rupees\r\nto Khan A`zam.\r\n\r\nOn this day a female antelope in milk was brought that allowed itself\r\nto be milked with ease, and gave every day four seers of milk. I\r\nhad never seen or heard of anything of the kind before. The milk of\r\nthe antelope, of the cow, and the buffalo in no way differs. They\r\nsay it is of great use in asthma. On the 11th of the month Raja Man\r\nSingh asked for leave to complete the army of the Deccan to which he\r\nhad been appointed, as well as to visit Amber, his native place. I\r\ngave him a male elephant of my own called Hushyar-mast, and gave him\r\nleave. On Monday, the 12th, as it was the anniversary of the death of\r\nthe late king Akbar, in addition to the expenses of that entertainment,\r\nwhich are fixed separately, I sent 4,000 rupees more to be divided\r\namong the faqirs and dervishes who are present in the enlightened\r\nmausoleum of the venerated one. On that day I exalted `Abdu-llah, the\r\nson of Khan A`zam, with the title of Sarfaraz Khan, and `Abdu-r-Rahim,\r\nson of Qasim Khan, with that of Tarbiyat Khan. On Tuesday, the 13th,\r\nI sent for Khusrau's daughter, and saw a child so like her father as\r\nno one can remember to have seen. The astrologers used to say that her\r\nadvent would not be auspicious to her father, but would be auspicious\r\nto me. At last it became known that they had augured rightly. They\r\nsaid that I should see her after three years. I saw her when she had\r\npassed this age. On the 21st of the month Khankhanan determined to\r\nclear out the province of the Nizamu-l-mulk, into which, after the\r\ndeath of the late king Akbar, some disturbances had found their way,\r\nand stated in writing that \"If I do not complete this service in the\r\ncourse of two years, I shall be guilty (of a fault), on the condition\r\nthat in addition to the force that had been allotted to that Subah\r\n12,000 more horse with 1,000,000 rupees should be sent with me.\" I\r\nordered that materials for the army and the treasure should be quickly\r\nprepared, and he should be despatched. On the 26th Mukhlis Khan,\r\nbakhshi of the ahadis, was appointed bakhshi of the Subah of the\r\nDeccan, and I bestowed his place on Ibrahim Husain Khan, the Mir\r\nBahr. On the 1st Rajab, Pishrau Khan and Kamal Khan, who belonged\r\nto the servants who were in constant attendance on me (ru-shinas),\r\ndied. Shah Tahmasp had given Pishrau Khan as a slave to my grandfather,\r\nand he was called Sa`adat. When he was promoted in the service of\r\nthe late king Akbar to the daroghahship and superintendence of the\r\nfarrashkhana (carpet department), he obtained the title of Pishrau. He\r\nwas so well acquainted with this service that one might say it was a\r\ngarment they had sewn on the stature of his capacity. When he was 90\r\nyears old he was quicker than lads of 14. He had the good fortune to\r\nserve my grandfather, my father, and me. Until he breathed his last\r\nhe was never for a moment without the intoxication of wine.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Besmeared with wine Fighani [281] went to the dust.\r\n    Alas! if the angels [282] smelt his fresh shroud!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHe left 1,500,000 rupees. He has one very stupid son, called\r\nRi`ayat. On account of his father's claims for services performed,\r\nI gave the superintendence of half the farrashkhana to him and the\r\nother half to Tukhmaq Khan. Kamal Khan was one of the slaves sincerely\r\ndevoted to my service; he is of the caste of the Kalals of Delhi. On\r\naccount of the great honesty and trustworthiness that he had shown\r\nI made him bakawal-begi (chief of the kitchen). Few such servants\r\nare ever met with. He had two sons, to both of whom I showed great\r\nkindness, but where are there others like him? On the 2nd of the said\r\nmonth La`l [283] Kalawant, who from his childhood had grown up in my\r\nfather's service, who had taught him every breathing and sound that\r\nappertains to the Hindi language, died in the 65th or 70th year of his\r\nage. One of his girls (concubines) ate opium on this event and killed\r\nherself. Few women among the Musulmans have ever shown such fidelity.\r\n\r\nIn Hindustan, especially in the province of Sylhet, [284] which is a\r\ndependency of Bengal, it was the custom for the people of those parts\r\nto make eunuchs of some of their sons and give them to the governor in\r\nplace of revenue (mal-wajibi). This custom by degrees has been adopted\r\nin other provinces, and every year some children are thus ruined and\r\ncut off from procreation. This practice has become common. At this\r\ntime I issued an order that hereafter no one should follow this\r\nabominable custom, and that the traffic in young eunuchs should\r\nbe completely done away with. Islam Khan and the other governors\r\nof the Subah of Bengal received firmans that whoever should commit\r\nsuch acts should be capitally punished, and that they should seize\r\neunuchs of tender years who might be in anyone's possession. No one\r\nof the former kings had obtained this success. Please Almighty God,\r\nin a short time this objectionable practice will be completely done\r\naway with, and the traffic in eunuchs being forbidden, no one shall\r\nventure on this unpleasant and unprofitable proceeding. I presented\r\nthe Khankhanan with a bay horse out of those sent me by Shah `Abbas;\r\nit was the head of the stable of my private horses. He was so\r\nrejoiced over it that it would be difficult to describe. In truth a\r\nhorse of this great size and beauty has hardly come to Hindustan. I\r\nalso gave him the elephant Futuh, that is unrivalled in fighting,\r\nwith twenty other elephants. As Kishan Singh, who was accompanying\r\nMahabat Khan, performed laudable service, and was wounded in the leg\r\nby a spear in the fight with the Rana's men, so that about twenty\r\nnoblemen of his were killed and about 3,000 made captive, he was\r\npromoted to the rank of 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse. On the 14th\r\nof the same month I gave an order for Mirza Ghazi to betake himself\r\nto Qandahar. A strange occurrence was that as soon as the aforesaid\r\nMirza started from Bakhar for that province the news of the death of\r\nSardar Khan, the governor of that place, came. Sardar Khan was one of\r\nthe permanent and intimate attendants of my uncle Muhammad Hakim, and\r\nwas known as Tukhta [285] Beg. I gave half his rank (the pay of it)\r\nto his sons. On Monday, the 17th, I went on foot on my pilgrimage to\r\nthe enlightened mausoleum of the late king. If it had been possible,\r\nI would have traversed this road with my eyelashes and head. My revered\r\nfather, on account of my birth, had gone on foot on a pilgrimage to\r\nthe shrine of Khwaja Mu`inu-d-din Sanjari Chishti, from Fathpur to\r\nAjmir, a distance of 120 kos: if I should traverse this road with my\r\nhead and eyes, what should I have done? When I was dignified with the\r\ngood fortune of making this pilgrimage, I saw the building that had\r\nbeen erected in the cemetery. It did not come up to my idea of what\r\nit ought to be, for that would be approved which the wayfarers of the\r\nworld should point to as one the like of which was not in the inhabited\r\nworld. Inasmuch as at the time of erecting the aforesaid building the\r\naffair of the ill-starred Khusrau took place, I started for Lahore,\r\nand the architects had built it after a design of their own. At last a\r\ncertain expenditure was made until a large sum was expended, and work\r\nwent on for three or four years. I ordered that experienced architects\r\nshould again lay the foundations, in agreement with men of experience,\r\nin several places, on a settled plan. By degrees a lofty building was\r\nerected, and a very bright garden was arranged round the building of\r\nthe shrine, and a large and lofty gateway with minarets of white stone\r\nwas built. On the whole they told me the cost of this lofty edifice\r\nwas 1,500,000 rupees, equivalent to 50,000 current tumans of Persia\r\nand 4,500,000 khanis, according to the currency of Turan.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the 23rd, I went with a band of courtiers who had not seen\r\nit to look at the reservoir in the house of Hakim `Ali like one that\r\nhad been made at Lahore in the time of my father. The reservoir is\r\n6 gaz by 6 gaz. At its side has been erected a well-lighted room,\r\nthe entrance to which is through the water, but the water does\r\nnot get into it. Ten or twelve people could meet in it. He made\r\nan offering of some of the cash and jewels that had accumulated\r\n[286] in his time. After looking at the room, and the entering of a\r\nnumber of courtiers therein, I raised him to the rank of 2,000, and\r\nreturned to the palace. On Sunday, the 14th Sha`ban, the Khankhanan\r\nwas honoured with a jewelled sword for the waist, a robe of honour,\r\nand a special elephant, and was given leave to go to his duty in the\r\nDeccan. Raja Suraj Singh, who was attached to him in that service,\r\nwas raised to the rank of 3,000 personal and 2,000 horse. As it was\r\nagain represented to me that oppression was being committed by the\r\nbrethren and attendants of Murtaza Khan on the ryots and people of\r\nAhmadabad in Gujarat, and that he was unable properly to restrain\r\nhis relations and people about him, I transferred the Subah from him\r\nand gave it to A`zam Khan, and it was settled that the latter should\r\nattend at court, and that his eldest son Jahangir Quli Khan should go\r\nto Gujarat as his deputy. The rank of Jahangir Quli Khan was fixed at\r\n3,000 personal and 2,500 horse. An order was given that in company with\r\nMohan Das diwan and Mas`ud Beg Hamazani bakhshi he should carry on the\r\nbusiness of the province. Mohan Das was promoted to the rank of 800\r\nwith 500 horse, and Mas`ud Beg to 300 with 150 horse. Tarbiyat Khan,\r\none of the personal servants, was given the rank of 700 with 400 horse,\r\nand Nasru-llah the same. Mihtar Khan, whose circumstances have been\r\nrelated, died at this time, and I promoted his son Munis Khan to the\r\nrank of 500 personal and 130 horse. On Wednesday, the 4th Zi-l-hijja,\r\nKhusrau had a son born to him by the daughter of the Khan A`zam,\r\nand I gave him the name of Buland-akhtar. On the 6th of the same\r\nmonth Muqarrab Khan sent a picture (with a report) that the belief\r\nof the Franks was this, that the picture was that of Timur. At the\r\ntime when Yildirim Bayazid was taken prisoner by his victorious army,\r\na Nazarene, who at that time was ruler [287] of Constantinople, had\r\nsent an ambassador with gifts and presents in token of submission and\r\nservice, and an artist who had been sent with the ambassador took his\r\nlikeness and brought it away. If this story were true, no better gift\r\ncould be presented to me. But as the picture had no resemblance to any\r\nof his descendants I was not satisfied of the truth of the statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOURTH NEW YEAR'S FEAST AFTER THE AUSPICIOUS ACCESSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe passing of the great star that illumines the world into the\r\nconstellation of Aries took place on the night of Saturday, the 14th\r\nZi-l-hijja, in Hijra 1017 (21st March, 1609), and New Year's Day that\r\nmade brilliant the world began with good auspices and rejoicing. On\r\nFriday, the 5th Muharram, in the year 1018, Hakim `Ali died. He was\r\nan unrivalled physician; he had derived much profit from Arabic\r\nsciences. He had written a commentary on the Canon (of Avicenna)\r\nin the time of my revered father. He had greater diligence than\r\nunderstanding, just as his appearance was better than his disposition,\r\nand his acquirements better than his talents; on the whole he was\r\nbad-hearted, and of an evil spirit. On the 20th Safar I dignified\r\nMirza Barkhurdar with the title of Khan `Alam. They brought from the\r\nneighbourhood of Fathpur a water-melon, greater than any I had ever\r\nseen. I ordered them to weigh it, and it came to 33 seers. On Monday,\r\nthe 19th Rabi`u-l-awwal, the feast of my annual lunar weighing was\r\narranged in the palace of my revered mother; a part of the money was\r\ndivided among the women who had assembled there on that day.\r\n\r\nAs it had been evident that in order to carry on the affairs of\r\nthe State in the Subah of the Deccan it was necessary to send one\r\nof the princes there, it came into my mind to send my son Parwiz\r\nthere. I ordered them to send his equipments and fix the hour for his\r\ndeparture. I summoned to Court Mahabat Khan, who had been nominated\r\nto the command of the army against the rebel Rana to arrange certain\r\nmatters at headquarters, and appointed in his place `Abdu-llah Khan,\r\nwhom I exalted with the title of Firuz-jang. I sent `Abdu-r-Razzaq\r\nbakhshi to carry an order to all the mansabdars of that army not to\r\ndepart from the orders of the aforesaid Khan, and to pay every heed to\r\nhis thanks and blame. On the 4th Jumada-l-awwal one of the goatherds,\r\nwho are a particular tribe, brought before me a gelded goat that\r\nhad teats like a female, and gave every day sufficient milk to take\r\nwith a cup of coffee. [288] As milk is one of the favours of Allah,\r\nand the source which nourishes many animals, I looked on this strange\r\naffair as an omen for good. On the 6th of the same month, having given\r\nhim the rank of 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse, I sent Khurram, son\r\nof Khan A`zam, to the government of the province of Sorath, which is\r\nknown as Junagadh (in Kathiyawad). I honoured [289] Hakim Sadra with\r\nthe title of Masihu-z-zaman, and gave him the rank of 500 personal\r\nand 30 horse. On the 16th a jewelled waist-sword was sent to Raja\r\nMan Singh. On the 22nd, having handed over 2,000,000 rupees for the\r\nexpenses of the army of the Deccan, which had been ordered for Parwiz,\r\nto a separate treasurer, 500,000 rupees more were given for the private\r\nexpenses of Parwiz. On the 25th, Wednesday, Jahandar (his son), who\r\npreviously to this had been appointed, together with Qutbu-d-din Khan\r\nKoka, to Bengal, came and waited on me. In reality it became known to\r\nme that he was a born devotee. [290] As my mind was taken up with the\r\npreparations for the Deccan, on the 1st Jumada-l-akhir I nominated the\r\nAmiru-l-umara as well to that duty. He was honoured with the favour\r\nof a robe of honour and a horse. Having promoted Karam Chand, son of\r\nJagannath, to the rank of 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse, I sent him\r\nin company with Parwiz. On the 4th of the month 370 ahadi horse were\r\nappointed with `Abdu-llah Khan to the assistance of the army employed\r\nagainst the Rana. One hundred horses were also despatched from the\r\ngovernment stables to be given as he thought proper to the mansabdars\r\nand ahadis. On the 17th I gave a ruby of the value of 60,000 rupees\r\nto Parwiz, and another ruby with two single pearls, worth about 40,000\r\nrupees, to Khurram. On Monday, the 28th, Jagannath was promoted to the\r\nrank of 5,000 personal and 3,000 horse, and on the 8th of Rajab, Ray\r\nJay Singh was promoted to that of 4,000 personal and 3,000 horse, and\r\nwas dismissed for service in the Deccan. On Thursday, the 9th, Prince\r\nShahriyar from Gujarat came and waited on me. On Tuesday, the 4th,\r\nI despatched my son Parwiz on the service of conquering the country of\r\nthe Deccan. He was presented with a robe of honour, a special horse, a\r\nspecial elephant, a sword, and a jewelled dagger. The Sardars and Amirs\r\nwho were appointed with him each according to his condition received\r\nand were made happy with the favour of a horse, a robe of honour, an\r\nelephant, a sword, and a jewelled dagger. I appointed 1,000 ahadis to\r\nbe in attendance on Parwiz for the service of the Deccan. On the same\r\nday a representation came from `Abdu-llah Khan that having pursued the\r\nrebel Rana into the hill country into rough places, he had captured\r\nseveral of his elephants and horses. When night came on he had escaped\r\nwith difficulty with his life. As he had made things go hard with him,\r\nhe would soon be taken prisoner or killed. I promoted the said Khan\r\nto the rank of 5,000 personal, and a rosary of pearls, worth 10,000\r\nrupees, was given to Parwiz. As I had given the province of Khandesh\r\nand Berar to the said son, I also conferred on him the fort of Asir,\r\nand 300 horse were sent with him to be given to ahadis, mansabdars,\r\nand whomever else he might consider worthy of favour. On the 26th,\r\nSaif Khan Barha was given the rank of 2,500 personal and 1,350 horse,\r\nand appointed to the faujdarship of the Sarkar of Hisar. On Monday,\r\nthe 4th Sha`ban, an elephant was given to Wazir Khan. On Friday,\r\nthe 22nd, I gave an order that as bang and buza (rice spirit)\r\nwere injurious, they should not be sold in the bazars and that\r\ngambling should be abolished, and on this subject I issued stringent\r\norders. On the 25th they brought a tiger from my private menagerie\r\nto fight with a bull. Many people gathered together to see the show,\r\nand a band of Jogis (religious mendicants) with them. One of the\r\nJogis was naked, and the tiger, by way of sport, and not with the\r\nidea of rage, turned towards him. It threw him on the ground and\r\nbegan to behave to him as it would to its own female. The next day\r\nand on several occasions the same thing took place. As no such thing\r\nhad ever been seen before and was exceedingly strange, this has been\r\nrecorded. [291] On the 2nd of the month of Ramazan, at the request\r\nof Islam Khan, Ghiyas [292] Khan was promoted to the rank of 1,500\r\npersonal and 800 horse. Faridun Khan Barlas was promoted to the rank\r\nof 2,500 with 2,000 horse. One thousand tolcha of gold and silver\r\nand 1,000 rupees were given in alms on the day of the procession of\r\nthe sun into the constellation of the Scorpion, which, according to\r\nthe general acceptation of the Hindoos, is called the Sankrant. On\r\nthe 10th of that month an elephant was presented to Shah Beg Yuzi\r\n[293] (? the panther-keeper), and Salamu-llah, the Arab, who is a\r\ndistinguished young man and a relative (son-in-law?) of Mubarak, the\r\nruler of Darful. [294] On account of some suspicion that Shah `Abbas\r\nhad entertained against him, he came to wait upon me. I patronised\r\nhim, and gave him the rank of 400 personal and 200 horse. Again,\r\nanother force, containing 193 mansabdars and 46 ahadis, I sent after\r\nParwiz for service in the Deccan. Fifty horses were also entrusted\r\nto one of the servants of the Court to convoy to Parwiz.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, the 13th, a certain idea came into my mind, and this rhymed\r\nghazal was produced:--\r\n\r\n\r\n \"What shall I do, for the arrow of loss of thee has pierced my liver!\r\n  So that the (evil) eye not reaching me again may reach another?\r\n  Thou movest as if frenzied, and the world is frenzied for thee.\r\n  I burn rue lest thy eye should reach me.\r\n  I am frenzied at union with my friend, and in despair at her absence.\r\n  Alas for the grief that has o'erwhelmed me!\r\n  I've grown mad that I may rush on the pathway of meeting:\r\n  Woe for the time that brought me the news!\r\n  Jahangir, the time for humility and prayer is every morning, [295]\r\n  I hope that some spark of light may take effect.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the 15th, I sent 50,000 rupees as sachaq to the house\r\nof the daughter of Muzaffar Husain Mirza, son of Sultan Husain\r\nMirza, son of Bahram Mirza, son of Shah Isma`il Safawi, who had\r\nbeen demanded in marriage for my son Khurram. On the 17th of the\r\nmonth Mubarak Khan Sarwani was honoured with the rank of 1,000\r\npersonal and 300 horse. Five thousand rupees were also given to\r\nhim, and 4,000 rupees to Haji Bi Uzbeg. On the 22nd a ruby and a\r\npearl were given to Shahriyar. One hundred thousand rupees were\r\ngiven for the subsistence of the Uymaqs (special cavalry) who\r\nhad been appointed for service in the Deccan. Two thousand rupees\r\nwere given to Farrukh Beg, the painter, who is unrivalled in the\r\nage. Four thousand rupees were sent for expenditure on Baba Hasan\r\nAbdal. One thousand rupees were handed to Mulla `Ali Ahmad Muhrkan\r\n(engraver) and Mulla Ruzbihan Shirazi to expend on the anniversary\r\nfestival of Hazrat Shaikh Salim at his mausoleum. An elephant was\r\ngiven to Muhammad Husain, the writer, and 1,000 rupees to Khwaja\r\n`Abdu-l-Haqq Ansari. I gave orders to the Diwans that having\r\nraised the rank of Murtaza Khan to 5,000 personal and horse\r\nthey should give him a jagir. I ordered Bihari Chand Qanungu,\r\nof the Sarkar of Agra, to take 1,000 footmen and equipment from\r\nthe Zamindars of Agra, and, fixing their monthly pay, to send\r\nthem to Parwiz in the Deccan, and 500,000 rupees more were fixed\r\nfor the expenses of Parwiz. On Thursday, the 4th Shawwal, Islam\r\nKhan was promoted to the rank of 5,000 personal and 5,000 horse,\r\nAbu-l-wali Beg Uzbeg to that of 1,500 and Zafar Khan to that of\r\n2,500. Two thousand rupees were given to Badi`u-z-zaman, son\r\nof Mirza Shahrukh, and 1,000 rupees to Pathan Misr. I ordered\r\nthat drums should be given to all of them as their rank had\r\nbeen raised to 3,000 and higher. Five thousand rupees more of\r\nthe money from my weighing were entrusted for the construction\r\nof a bridge at Baba Hasan Abdal and the building that is there\r\nto Abu-l-wafa, son of Hakim Abu-l-fath, in order that he might\r\nexert himself and put the bridge and the aforesaid building in\r\nperfect order. On Saturday, the 13th, when four gharis of day\r\nwere left, the moon began to be eclipsed. By degrees the whole\r\nof its body was obscured, and it continued till five gharis of\r\nnight had passed. In order to avert the bad omen of this I had\r\nmyself weighed against gold, silver, cloth, and grain, and gave\r\naway in alms all kinds of animals, such as elephants, horses,\r\netc., the cost of all of which was 15,000 rupees. I ordered them\r\nto be distributed among the deserving and the poor. On the 25th,\r\nat the request of her father, I took the daughter of Ram Chand\r\nBandilab into my service (i.e. married her). I gave an elephant\r\nto Mir Fazil, nephew of Mir Sharif, who had been appointed to\r\nthe faujdarship of Qabulah and those regions `Inayat-ullah was\r\ndignified with the title of `Inayat Khan. On Wednesday, the 1st\r\nZi-l-qa`da, Bihari Chand was granted the rank of 500 personal and\r\n300 horse. A khapwa (dagger), adorned with jewels was given to my\r\nson Baba Khurram. Mulla Hayati, by whom I had sent a message to\r\nthe Khankhanan, with a verbal message containing (expressions of)\r\nall kinds of condescension and affection, came and brought before\r\nme a ruby and two pearls of the value of about 20,000 rupees,\r\nwhich the Khankhanan had sent by him. Mir Jamalu-d-din Husain,\r\nwho was in Burhanpur and whom I had sent for, came and waited on\r\nme. I presented Shaja`at Khan Dakhani with 2,000 rupees. On the\r\n6th of the aforesaid month, before Parwiz arrived at Burhanpur, a\r\npetition came from the Khankhanan and the Amirs that the Dakhanis\r\nhad assembled together and were making disturbances. When I\r\ndiscovered that, notwithstanding the nomination of Parwiz and\r\nthe army that had proceeded with him and been appointed to his\r\nservice, they were still in need of support and assistance, it\r\noccurred to me that I should go myself, and by Allah's favour\r\nsatisfy myself with regard to that affair. In the meanwhile a\r\npetition came also from Asaf Khan that my coming there would be\r\nfor the advantage of the daily-increasing State. A petition from\r\n`Adil Khan, from Bijapur, also came, that if one of the trusted\r\nones of the Court could be appointed there to whom he could tell\r\nhis desires and claims, so that the envoy might convey them to me,\r\nhe hoped that it might become the means of affording profit to\r\nthese slaves (i.e. himself). On this account I consulted with the\r\nAmirs and loyal men, and told them to represent whatever entered\r\ninto anyone's mind. My son Khan Jahan represented that inasmuch as\r\nso many Amirs had been despatched for the conquest of the Deccan,\r\nit was not necessary for me to go in person. If he were ordered,\r\nhe himself would go and attend on the prince and would, please God,\r\nperform this duty while serving him. Those words were approved of by\r\nall those who were loyal. I had never contemplated separation from\r\nhim, but as the affair was an important one I necessarily gave him\r\npermission, and ordered that as soon as matters had been arranged he\r\nshould return without delay, and should not remain more than a year\r\nin those regions. On Tuesday, the 17th Zi-l-qa`da, he was free to\r\ngo. I presented him with a special gold-embroidered robe of honour,\r\na special horse with a jewelled saddle, a jewelled sword, and a special\r\nelephant I also gave him a yak-tail standard (tuman tugh). I appointed\r\nFida; Khan, who was one of my faithful servants, and to whom I gave\r\na robe of honour and a horse and his expenses, promoting him to the\r\nrank of 1,000 personal and 400 horse, original and extra, to go with\r\nKhan Jahan, in order that if it were necessary to send anyone to `Adil\r\nKhan according to his request, he might despatch him. Lanku Pandit,\r\nwho in the time of the late king Akbar had come with offerings from\r\n`Adil Khan, I also gave leave to go with Khan Jahan, bestowing on\r\nhim a horse, a robe of honour, and money. Of the Amirs and soldiers\r\nwho had been appointed with `Abdu-llah Khan to the duty of beating\r\nback the Rana, men such as Raja Bir Singh Deo, Shaja`at Khan, Raja\r\nBikramajit, and others, with 4,000 or 5,000 horse, were nominated to\r\nsupport Khan Jahan. I sent Mu`tamad Khan with the announcement that I\r\nhad made him a sazawal (i.e. one who urges on others), and that he was\r\nto act along with Khan Jahan in Ujjain. Out of the men of the palace,\r\nI sent 6,000 or 7,000 horse with him, such as Saif Khan Barha, Haji\r\nBi Uzbeg, Salamu-llah `Arab, brother's son of Mubarak `Arab, who had\r\nin his possession the province of Jutra(?) [296] and Darful(?) and\r\nthat neighbourhood, and other mansabdars and courtiers. At the time\r\nof giving them leave I gave each one an increase of rank and robe of\r\nhonour and money for their expenses. Making Muhammad Beg paymaster\r\nof the army, I provided him with 1,000,000 rupees to take with him. I\r\nsent to Parwiz a special horse, and to the Khankhanan and other Amirs\r\nand officers who were appointed to that Subah dresses of honour.\r\n\r\nAfter carrying out these matters I left the city for the purpose of\r\nhunting. One thousand rupees were given to Mir `Ali Akbar. As the\r\nRabi` Fasl (Spring season) had arrived, for fear any damage should\r\nhappen to the cultivation of the ryots from the passage of the army,\r\nand notwithstanding that I had appointed a qurisawul [297] (Erskine has\r\nKor, the Yasawal) (probably a kind of provost marshal) with the band of\r\nahadis for the purpose of guarding the fields, I ordered certain men\r\nto see what damage had been done to the crops from stage to stage and\r\npay compensation to the ryots. I gave 10,000 rupees to the daughter of\r\nthe Khankhanan, the wife of Daniyal, 1,000 rupees to `Abdu-r-Rahim Khar\r\n(i.e. ass) for expenses, and 1,000 to Qacha the Dakhani. On the 12th,\r\nKhanjar Khan, brother of `Abdu-llah Khan, received the rank of 1,000\r\npersonal and 500 horse original and extra, and Bahadur Khan, another\r\nbrother, that of 600 personal and 300 horse. On this day two antelopes\r\nwith horns and one doe were taken. On the 13th I bestowed on and sent\r\nto Khan Jahan a special horse. Having promoted Badi`u-z-zaman, son of\r\nMirza Shahrukh, to the rank of 1,000 and 500 horse, I gave him 5,000\r\nrupees for expenses, and he was sent off with Khan Jahan for service\r\nin the Deccan. On this day two male and three female antelope were\r\nkilled. On Wednesday, the 10th, I killed a female nilgaw and a black\r\nantelope with a gun, and on the 15th a female nilgaw and a chikara\r\n(gazelle). On the 17th of the month two rubies and a pearl were brought\r\nto me by Jahangir Quli Khan from Gujarat, as well as a jewelled opium\r\nbox, which Muqarrab Khan had sent from the port of Cambay. On the\r\n20th I killed with a gun a tigress and a nilgaw. There were two cubs\r\nwith the tigress, but they disappeared from view in consequence of\r\nthe thickness of the jungle and the number of trees. An order was\r\ngiven that they should search for and bring them. When I reached\r\nthe halting-place my son Khurram brought me one of the cubs, and the\r\nnext day Mahabat Khan caught the other and brought it. On the 22nd,\r\nwhen I had got within shot of a nilgaw, suddenly a groom (jilaudar)\r\nand two kahar (bearers) appeared, and the nilgaw escaped. In a great\r\nrage I ordered them to kill the groom on the spot, and to hamstring\r\n[298] the kahars and mount them on asses and parade them through\r\nthe camp, so that no one should again have the boldness to do such a\r\nthing. After this I mounted a horse and continued hunting with hawks\r\nand falcons, and came to the halting-place.\r\n\r\nNext day, under the guidance of Iskandar Mu`in, I shot a large nilgaw,\r\nand promoted him to the rank of 600 personal and 500 horse. On Friday,\r\nthe 24th, Safdar Khan, who had come from the Subah of Behar, had the\r\ngood fortune to perform his obeisance to me. He presented as offerings\r\na hundred muhrs, a sword, and five female and one male elephant. The\r\nmale elephant was accepted. On the same day Yadgar Khwaja of Samarkand\r\ncame from Balkh and paid his respects. He made offerings of an album,\r\nsome horses, and other presents, and was dignified with a robe of\r\nhonour. On Wednesday, 6th Zi-l-hijja, Mu`izzu-l-mulk, who had been\r\nremoved from the paymastership of the army against the rebel Rana,\r\nill and miserable, waited on me. On the 14th of the said month,\r\nhaving pardoned all the faults of `Abdu-r-Rahim Khar, [299] I promoted\r\nhim to the rank of yuzbashi (centurion) and 20 horse, and ordered\r\nhim to go to Kashmir and in company with the bakhshi of that place\r\nhold a muster of the troops of Qilij Khan and all the jagirdars and\r\nUymaks in the service or not, and to bring the list. Kishwar Khan,\r\nson of Qutbu-d-din Khan, came from the fort of Rohtas and had the\r\ngood fortune to pay his respects to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIFTH NEW YEAR'S FEAST FROM THE AUSPICIOUS ACCESSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the 24th Zi-l-hijja (20th March, 1610), after two watches\r\nand three gharis the sun entered into the constellation of Aries, which\r\nis the house of honour and good fortune, and at this auspicious hour\r\nthe New Year's feast was arranged at Bak Bhal, one of the villages of\r\nthe parganah of Bari, and according to the rules of my revered father\r\nI mounted the throne. On that morning, which was the New Year's Day\r\nthat lighted up the world, and coincided with the 1st of Farwardin\r\nof the 5th year from my accession, I held a public reception, and\r\nall the nobles and servants of the Court had the good fortune to\r\npay their respects. Some of the nobles' offerings were laid before\r\nme. Khan A`zam gave a pearl worth 4,000 rupees; Miran Sadr Jahan,\r\ntwenty-eight hawks and falcons, and other gifts; Mahabat Khan, two\r\nEuropean boxes, the sides of which were made with slabs of glass,\r\nso that whatever was placed inside could be seen from outside in a\r\nway that you might say there was nothing between them; Kishwar Khan,\r\ntwenty-two male and female elephants. In the same way each of the\r\nservants of the Court laid before me the presents and offerings that\r\nthey had. Nasru-llah, son of Fathu-llah sharbatchi (in charge of the\r\nsharbat), was placed in charge of the offerings. By Sarang Deo, who had\r\nbeen appointed to carry orders to the victorious army of the Deccan,\r\nI sent souvenirs (tabarruk) to Parwiz and to each of the officers. I\r\npresented Husamu-d-din, son of Ghazi Khan [300] Badakhshi, who had\r\ntaken to the ways of a dervish and seclusion, with 1,000 rupees and\r\na farji shawl. The day after the New Year's Day I mounted and started\r\nfor a tiger-hunt. Two males and a female were killed. I gave rewards\r\nto the ahadis who had shown bravery and gone in to the tigers, and\r\nincreased their monthly pay. On the 26th of the same month I went and\r\nbusied myself mostly with hunting nilgaw. As the air was hot and the\r\n(propitious) hour for re-entering Agra had nearly arrived, I went to\r\nRupbas, and hunted antelope in that neighbourhood for some days. On\r\nSaturday, the 1st Muharram, 1019, Rup Khawass, who was the founder of\r\nRupbas, presented the offering that he had prepared. That which pleased\r\nwas accepted and what remained was given him back as a reward. At the\r\nsame time Bayazid Mankali and his brothers, who had come from the Subah\r\nof Bengal, were honoured with paying their respects. Sayyid Adam, son\r\nof Sayyid Qasim Barha, who had come from Ahmadabad, also had the same\r\ngood fortune. He presented an elephant as an offering. The faujdarship\r\nof the Subah of Multan was given to Wali Bi Uzbeg in place of Taj Khan.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 3rd Muharram of the 5th year, I halted at the\r\nMandakar Garden, which is in the neighbourhood of the city. On the\r\nmorning on which was the auspicious hour of entry into the city,\r\nafter a watch and two gharis had passed I mounted and rode on a\r\nhorse to the beginning of the inhabited part, and when I came to\r\nthe immediate neighbourhood mounted on an elephant, so that the\r\npeople from far and near might see, and scattering money on both\r\nsides of the road, at the hour that the astrologers had chosen,\r\nafter midday had passed, entered with congratulation and happiness\r\nthe royal palace. In accordance with the usual custom of the New\r\nYear I had ordered them to decorate the palace, which is like the\r\ncourts of heaven. After seeing the decorations, Khwaja Jahan laid\r\nbefore me the offering that he had prepared. Having accepted out of\r\nthe ornaments and jewels, dresses and goods, whatever I approved of,\r\nI gave the rest as a reward to him. I had ordered the clerks of the\r\nhunting department to write out (a list of) all the animals that\r\nhad been killed from the time of my leaving until I re-entered the\r\ncity. At this time they represented that in 56 days 1,362 animals,\r\nquadrupeds, and birds had been killed; the tigers were 7 in number;\r\nnilgaw, male and female, 70; black buck, 51; does and mountain goats\r\nand antelope (rojh), etc., 82; kulang (cranes); peacocks, surkhab,\r\n[301] and other birds, 129; fish, 1,023. On Friday, the 7th, Muqarrab\r\nKhan came from the ports of Cambay and Surat, and had the honour of\r\nwaiting on me. He had brought jewels and jewelled things, and vessels\r\nof gold and silver made in Europe, and other beautiful and uncommon\r\npresents, male and female Abyssinian slaves, Arab horses, and things\r\nof all kinds that came into his mind. Thus his presents were laid\r\nbefore me for two and a half months, and most of them were pleasing\r\nto me. On this day Safdar Khan, who held the rank of 1,000 personal\r\nand 500 horse, had an increase of 500 personal and 200 horse, and was\r\npresented with a standard, and given leave to return to his former\r\njagir. Standards were also given to Kishwar Khan and Faridun [302]\r\nKhan Barlas. A fighting elephant for Afzal Khan (Abu-l-fazl's son)\r\nwas handed over to his son Bishutan, to take to his father. I bestowed\r\n1,000 rupees on Khwaja Husain, a descendant of Khwaja Mu`inu-d-din\r\nChishti, as was usual for the half-year. The Khankhanan had sent\r\nas an offering a \"Yusuf and Zulaikha\" in the handwriting of Mulla\r\nMir `Ali, [303] with illustrations and in a beautiful gilt binding,\r\nworth 1,000 muhrs. This Ma`sum, his Wakil, brought and submitted. Up\r\nto the day of culmination, which is the conclusion of the New Year's\r\nfeast, every day many offerings were laid before me by the Amirs and\r\nservants of the Court. Whichever of the rarities was approved of by\r\nme I accepted, and gave back what was left. On Thursday, the 13th,\r\ncorresponding to the 19th Farwardin, which is the day of culmination\r\nof the sun and of gladness and pleasure, I ordered them to prepare\r\nan entertainment of different kinds of intoxicating drinks, and an\r\norder was given to the Amirs and servants of the Court that everyone\r\nmight choose the kind of drink he affected. Many took wine and some\r\nmufarrih (exhilarating drinks), whilst some ate what they wished of the\r\npreparations of opium. The assembly was successfully held. Jahangir\r\nQuli Khan from Gujarat had sent as an offering a throne of silver,\r\ninlaid and painted, of a new fashion and shape, which was presented to\r\nme. A standard was also conferred on Maha Singh. In the commencement\r\nof my reign I had repeatedly given orders that no one should make\r\neunuchs or buy or sell them, and whoever did so would be answerable\r\nas a criminal. At this time Afzal Khan sent some of these evildoers\r\nto Court from the Subah of Behar, who were continually perpetrating\r\nthis vile offence. I ordered these unthinking ones (bi-`aqibatan)\r\nto be imprisoned for life.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 12th an uncommon and strange event took place. Some\r\nDelhi singers (Qawwalan, see Jarrett, ii, 236) were singing songs\r\nin my presence, and Sayyidi [304] Shah was, by way of buffoonery,\r\nmimicking a religious dance. This verse of Amir Khusrau was the refrain\r\n(miyan-khana) of the song--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Each nation has its right road of faith and its shrine\r\n                                                        (qibla-gahi).\r\n    I've set up my shrine (qibla) on the path of him with the\r\n                                                        cocked cap.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI asked what was the real meaning of the (last) hemistich. Mulla\r\n`Ali Ahmad, [305] the seal engraver, who in his own craft was one of\r\nthe first of the age, and had the title of Khalifa, and was an old\r\nservant, and with whose father I had learned when I was little, came\r\nforward and said, \"I have heard from my father that one day Shaikh\r\nNizamu-d-din Auliya had put his cap on the side of his head, and\r\nwas sitting on a terraced roof by the bank of the Jumna and watching\r\nthe devotions [306] of the Hindus. Just then Amir Khusrau appeared,\r\nand the Shaikh turned to him and said, 'Do you see this crowd,'\r\nand then he recited this line:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    'Each race has its right road of faith and its shrine'\r\n                                                        (qibla-gahi).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Amir, without hesitating, respectfully did homage to the Shaikh,\r\nand addressing him said--\r\n\r\n\r\n    'I've set up my shrine in the direction of him with the\r\n                                                   cocked cap.'\" [307]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aforesaid Mulla, when these words were uttered, and the last words\r\nof the second hemistich passed over his tongue, became senseless and\r\nfell down. Conceiving a great fear from his falling down, I went to\r\nhis head. Most of those who were present doubted whether he had not\r\nhad an epileptic fit. The physicians who were present distractedly\r\nmade inquiry and felt his pulse and brought medicine. However much\r\nthey beat their hands and feet and exerted themselves, he did not come\r\nto. Immediately he fell he had delivered his soul to the Creator. As\r\nhis body was quite warm, they thought that possibly some life might\r\nbe left in him. After a short time it became evident that the thing\r\nwas all over and he was dead. They carried him away dead to his own\r\nhouse. I had never seen this kind of death, and sent money to his\r\nsons for his shroud and burial, and the next morning they sent him\r\nto Delhi and buried him in the burial-place of his ancestors.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, the 21st, Kishwar Khan, who held the rank of 1,500, was\r\npromoted to 2,000 personal and horse, and, having been presented\r\nwith an Iraq horse out of my private stable, a robe of honour and a\r\nprivate elephant, named Bakht-jit, [308] and the Faujdarship of the\r\ncountry of Uch, was dismissed with a view to the punishment of the\r\nrebels of that region. Bayazid Mankali, having been honoured with\r\na robe and a horse, was sent off together with his brothers in the\r\ncompany of Kishwar Khan. An elephant from my private stud, by name\r\n`Alam-guman, was entrusted to Habibu-llah for Raja Man Singh and\r\nsent. A special horse was sent to Bengal for Kesho Das Maru, [309]\r\nand a female elephant was now given to `Arab Khan, the jagirdar\r\nof Jalalabad. At this time Iftikhar Khan had sent an offering of a\r\nrare elephant from Bengal. As I approved of it, it was entered among\r\nmy private elephants. I raised the rank of Ahmad [310] Beg Khan,\r\nwho had been nominated to the command of the army of Bangash on\r\naccount of his good service and that of his sons, from his original\r\nrank of 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse by 500 more personal. I sent\r\na gold throne [311] of jewelled work for Parwiz, and a sarpich,\r\nwhich was of rubies and pearls, and made at a cost of 2,000 rupees,\r\nwas sent for Khan Jahan by the hand of Habib, son of Sarbarah Khan,\r\nto Burhanpur. At this time it became known that Kaukab, son of Qamar\r\nKhan, had become intimate with a Sanyasi, and by degrees his words,\r\nwhich were all blasphemous and impious, made an impression on that\r\nfoolish fellow. He had made `Abdu-l-Latif, son of Naqib Khan, and\r\nSharif, his cousins, partners in that error. When this affair was\r\ndiscovered, with only a slight frightening they revealed certain\r\ncircumstances with regard to themselves, the relation of which would\r\nbe extremely disgusting. Considering their punishment advisable,\r\nI imprisoned Kaukab [312] and Sharif after giving them a whipping,\r\nand ordered `Abdu-l-Latif a hundred lashes in my presence. This\r\nspecial chastisement (was given) for the purpose of carrying out\r\nthe Divine law in order that other ignorant persons might not be\r\ndisposed towards the same actions. On Monday, the 24th, Mu`azzam\r\nKhan was despatched to Delhi to punish the rebels and disaffected\r\nof that neighbourhood. Two thousand rupees were given to Shaja`at\r\nKhan Dakhani. I had ordered Shaikh Husain Darshani to proceed with\r\ncertain firmans to Bengal and presents to each of the Amirs of that\r\nSubah. I now gave him his orders and despatched him. With an eye on\r\nhis actions and his approved services, I promoted Islam Khan to the\r\nrank of 5,000 personal and horse, and bestowed on him a special dress\r\nof honour. I gave a special dress of honour also to Kishwar Khan, and\r\npresented Raja Kalyan with an Iraq horse, and similarly to the other\r\nAmirs there were given robes of honour or horses. Faridun Barlas,\r\nwho held the rank of 1,500 personal and 1,300 horse, I promoted to\r\n2,000 personal and 1,500 horse.\r\n\r\nOn the night of Monday, the 1st Safar, through the carelessness of the\r\nservants, a great fire occurred in the house of Khwaja Abu-l-hasan,\r\nand before they became aware of it and the fire could be put out\r\nmany of his properties were burnt. In order to afford consolation to\r\nthe mind of the Khwaja and to make up for the loss he had sustained,\r\nI gave him 40,000 rupees. On Saif Khan Barha, who had been cherished\r\nand brought up by me, I bestowed a standard. I increased the rank of\r\nMu`izzu-l-mulk, who had been appointed to the Diwanship of Kabul,\r\nfrom his original of 1,000 personal and 225 horse by 200 personal\r\nand 275 horse, and dismissed him. The next day I sent a phul-katara\r\n(dagger) studded with valuable jewels to Burhanpur to Khan Jahan.\r\n\r\nA widow woman complained that Muqarrab Khan had taken her daughter\r\nby force in the port of Cambay, and after some while, during which\r\nhe had kept her in his own house, when she enquired for the girl had\r\nsaid that she had died by an unavoidable death. I ordered an enquiry\r\nto be made into the affair. After much search I discovered that one\r\nof his attendants had been guilty of this outrage, and had him put\r\nto death, and reduced Muqarrab Khan's mansab by one half, and made\r\nan allowance to the woman who had been thus injured.\r\n\r\nAs on Sunday, the 7th of the month, a qiran-i-nahsin (an unlucky\r\nconjunction) had occurred, I gave alms of gold and silver and other\r\nmetals, and different kinds of cereals, to faqirs and indigent people\r\nto be divided in most parts of the dominion. On the night of Monday,\r\nthe 8th, having sent for Shaikh Husain Sirhindi and Shaikh Mustafa,\r\nwho were celebrated for the adoption of the ways of dervishdom and the\r\nstate of poverty, a party was held, and by degrees the assembly engaged\r\nwarmly in sama` and wajd (dervish dancing and ecstasy). Hilarity and\r\nfrenzy were not wanting. After the meeting was over I gave money to\r\neach and gave him leave. As Mirza Ghazi Beg Tarkhan repeatedly made\r\nrepresentations with regard to provisions for Qandahar and the monthly\r\npay of the musketeers of the said fort, I ordered 200,000 rupees to\r\nbe sent there from the treasury of Lahore. [313]\r\n\r\nOn the 19th Urdibihisht, in the fifth year of my reign, corresponding\r\nwith the 4th Safar, there occurred a strange affair at Patna, which\r\nis the seat of government of the province of Behar. Afzal Khan, the\r\ngovernor of the Subah, went off to the jagir to which he had just\r\nbeen appointed, and which was at a distance of 60 kos from Patna, and\r\nhanded over the fort and the city to the charge of Shaikh Banarasi and\r\nGhiyas Zain-khani, the Diwan of the Subah, and to a number of other\r\nmansabdars. With the idea that there were no enemies in that region he\r\ndid not satisfy himself as he should have with regard to the protection\r\nof the fort and city. By chance, at that time an unknown man of the\r\nname of Qutb belonging to the people of Uch, who was a mischievous\r\nand seditious fellow, came to the province of Ujjainiyya, [314]\r\nwhich is in the neighbourhood of Patna, with the look of a dervish\r\nand the clothes of a beggar, and having made acquaintance with men\r\nof that part, who were always seditious, represented to them that he\r\nwas Khusrau, who had escaped from prison and conveyed himself there;\r\nsaying that if they would accompany and assist him, after the affair\r\nhad been completed they would be the ministers of his State. In short,\r\ndeceiving those simpletons with foolish words he brought them over to\r\nhim and persuaded them that he was Khusrau. He showed those deceived\r\nones the parts about his eyes, where at some time he had produced\r\nscars, of which the marks were still apparent, and told them that in\r\nthe prison they had fastened cups (katori) on them and those were the\r\nmarks. [315] Through these falsehoods and deceit a number of foot- and\r\nhorsemen had collected round him, and had obtained information that\r\nAfzal Khan was not at Patna. Considering this a great opportunity,\r\nthey made a raid, and when two or three hours of the day had passed\r\non Sunday came to the city, and being hindered by nothing went for\r\nthe fort. Shaikh Banarasi, who was in the fort, obtaining news of\r\nthis, went in a disturbed state to the gate of the fort. The enemy,\r\nwho came on with speed, did not give him time to close the gate of\r\nthe fort. Together with Ghiyas, he betook himself to the side of the\r\nriver by a wicket gate, and procuring a boat proposed to go to Afzal\r\nKhan. Those rebels came with ease into the fort and took possession\r\nof Afzal Khan's property and the royal treasury; and some of those\r\nwretched creatures who wait on events, who were in the city and its\r\nneighbourhood, joined them. This news reached Afzal Khan at Gorakhpur\r\n(Kharakpur), [316] and Shaikh Banarasi and Ghiyas also came to him\r\nthere by way of the river. Letters came from the city that this wretch,\r\nwho called himself Khusrau, was in reality not Khusrau. Afzal Khan,\r\nplacing his trust on the grace and mercy of Allah, and through my\r\ngood fortune, started without delay against those rebels. In five\r\ndays he reached the neighbourhood of Patna. When the news of Afzal\r\nKhan's coming reached those scoundrels, they entrusted the fort to\r\none of those whom they had confidence in, and the horse and foot\r\narraying themselves went out for four kos to meet Afzal Khan. A\r\nfight took place on the bank of the river Pun Pun, and after a slight\r\nskirmish the array of those ill-fated ones was broken and they became\r\nscattered. In great bewilderment a second time that wretch was coming\r\ninto the fort with a few men. Afzal Khan followed him, and did not\r\nallow them to close the gate of the fort. Going to Afzal Khan's house\r\nin a state of confusion, they fortified the house and remained there\r\nfor three watches, and fought. They wounded about thirty people with\r\narrows. After his companions had gone to jahannam (hell) he himself\r\nbecame helpless, and asked for quarter, and waited upon Afzal Khan. In\r\norder to put a stop to this affair, Afzal Khan executed him on the\r\nsame day, and imprisoned some of his companions who had fallen alive\r\ninto his hand. These items of news one after another reached the\r\nroyal ear. I summoned to Agra Shaikh Banarasi and Ghiyas Zain-khani\r\nand the other mansabdars who had made default in holding the fort and\r\nprotecting the city, and ordered their hair and beards to be cut off,\r\nand that they should be clothed in women's clothes, seated on asses,\r\nand paraded round the city of Agra and in the bazars, as a warning\r\nand example to others.\r\n\r\nAt this time representations succeeded each other from Parwiz and the\r\nAmirs appointed to the Deccan and those who were well-wishers of the\r\nState, that `Adil Khan Bijapuri prayed that they would send to him\r\nMir Jamalu-d-din Husain Inju, on whose words and acts all the rulers\r\nof the Deccan had great reliance, that he might associate himself\r\nwith them and dispel the fear in their minds, and the affairs of\r\nthat place might be arranged as it might seem proper to `Adil Khan,\r\nwho had chosen the way of loyalty and service. In any case, he might\r\ndrive out of their minds the fear that was in them, and soothing them\r\nmight give him hopes of the royal favour. In order to obtain this end,\r\non the 16th of the same month I despatched the above-mentioned Mir,\r\ngiving him a present of 10,000 rupees. I increased the former rank of\r\nQasim Khan, which was 1,000 personal and 500 horse, by 500 personal\r\nand horse, in order that he might go to the support of his brother\r\nIslam Khan in Bengal. At the same time, in order to punish Bikramajit,\r\nZamindar of the province Bandhu, [317] who had withdrawn his foot\r\nfrom the circle of obedience and service, I appointed Maha Singh,\r\ngrandson of Raja Man Singh, to proceed to put down the disaffection\r\nin that region and at the same time administer the estate of the\r\njagir of the Raja, which was in that neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of the month I gave an elephant to Shaja`at Khan\r\nDakhani. As the governor of Jalalabad had written and represented\r\nthe ruinous state of the fort of that place, I ordered what might be\r\nrequired for the repair of the said fort to be taken from the treasury\r\nof Lahore. Iftikhar Khan had done approved service in Bengal. On\r\nthe request of the governor of that Subah I increased his original\r\nrank, which was 1,500, by 500. On the 28th a representation came from\r\n`Abdu-llah Khan Firuz-jang, containing recommendations in favour of\r\nsome of the zealous servants who had been sent with him to subdue the\r\nrebel Rana. As Ghaznin Khan Jalwari had shown the greatest zeal of all\r\nin this service, I increased by 500 personal and 400 horse his former\r\nrank, which was 1,500 personal and 300 horse. In the same manner each\r\none of those persons was promoted according to his services.\r\n\r\nDaulat Khan, who had been sent to Allahabad to bring the throne of\r\nblack stone, came on Wednesday, the 4th of the month of Mihr (15th\r\nSeptember, 1610), and had an audience and brought the stone safe and\r\nsound. In truth it was a wonderful slab, very black and shining. Many\r\nsay it is of a species of touchstone; in length it was one-eighth\r\nless than four cubits, and in breadth 2 1/2 cubits and one tasu,\r\n[318] whilst its thickness may be three tasu. I ordered stone-cutters\r\nto carve suitable couplets on the sides of it. They had attached feet\r\nto it of the same kind of stone. I often sat on that throne.\r\n\r\nAs the brothers of Khan `Alam became security for him, I brought out\r\nof prison `Abdu-s-Subhan Khan, who was in confinement for certain\r\noffences, and promoted him to the rank of 1,000 personal and 400\r\nhorse, and appointed him to the faujdarship of the Subah of Allahabad,\r\nand gave him the jagir of Qasim Khan, the brother of Islam Khan. I\r\nsent Tarbiyat Khan to the faujdarship of the Sarkar of Alwar. On the\r\n12th of the same month a representation arrived from Khan Jahan that\r\nthe Khankhanan, according to my order, had started for the Court in\r\ncompany with Mahabat Khan, and that Mir Jamalu-d-din Husain, who had\r\nbeen nominated by the Court to go to Bijapur, had also gone from\r\nBurhanpur, together with the wakils of `Adil Khan, to Bijapur. On\r\nthe 21st of the same month I promoted Murtaza Khan to the subadarship\r\nof the Panjab, which is one of the largest charges in my dominions,\r\nand gave him a special shawl. Having appointed Taj Khan, who was\r\nin the Subah of Multan to the governorship of Kabul, I added 500\r\nhorse to the rank of 3,000 personal and 1,500 horse already held by\r\nhim. At the request of `Abdu-llah Khan Firuz-jang, the son of Rana\r\nShankar was also promoted in rank. When Mahabat Khan, who had been\r\nsent to Burhanpur to ascertain the numbers of the forces of the Amirs\r\nappointed to the Deccan, and to bring the Khankhanan, arrived in the\r\nneighbourhood of Agra, he left the Khankhanan some stages off the city\r\nand came on in front himself, and was honoured with the good fortune\r\nof paying his respects and kissing the threshold. After a few days,\r\non the 12th Aban, the Khankhanan came and waited on me. As many of\r\nthose who were loyal had represented the state of his affairs whether\r\ntrue or false, according to their ideas, and I was displeased with\r\nhim, because the degree of favour and regard that I previously had\r\nobserved in his case and that I had seen in my revered father had\r\nnot produced its effect, I did justice in the matter, for previously\r\nto this a letter of appointment to the service of the Deccan for a\r\ncertain time had been given to him, and he had proceeded there in\r\nattendance on Sultan Parwiz with other nobles for that important\r\nmatter. After he arrived at Burhanpur he had not looked to the\r\nopportuneness of the time, and at an improper season for moving,\r\nand when forage and other necessaries had not been laid in, he had\r\ntaken Sultan Parwiz and his forces above the Ghats, and by degrees,\r\nin consequence of want of concert among the Sardars and his treachery,\r\nand of conflicting opinions, things had come to such a pass that\r\ngrain was obtained with difficulty, and not a man was to be got for\r\nlarge sums of money. The affairs of the army became so confused that\r\nnothing went on properly, and horses, camels, and other four-footed\r\nbeasts died. In consequence of the exigency of the time he had patched\r\nup a kind of peace with the enemy and withdrawn Sultan Parwiz and\r\nthe army to Burhanpur. As this business did not turn out well, all\r\nthe well-wishers of the State knew that this division (of counsels)\r\nand confusion had arisen from treachery and want of arrangement of the\r\nKhankhanan, and represented this to the Court. Although this appeared\r\naltogether incredible, at last this impression was left upon my mind,\r\nand a representation came from Khan Jahan to the effect that all\r\nthis mischief and confusion had arisen through the treachery of the\r\nKhankhanan; either this service should be left entirely in his control,\r\nor, summoning him to Court, I should appoint to this duty this man\r\nwhom I had myself cherished and brought up, and appoint 30,000 horse\r\nto support this slave (Khan Jahan himself), in order that in the space\r\nof two years, having freed the whole of the royal province, now in the\r\npossession of the enemy, and having brought the fort of Qandahar [319]\r\nand other forts on the border into the occupation of the servants of\r\nthe Court, he should include in the royal dominions the province of\r\nBijapur. If he did not complete this service in that time, he might\r\nbe debarred from the good fortune of paying his respects (to me)\r\nand would not show his face to the servants of the Court. When the\r\nrelations between the Sardars and the Khankhanan reached this point,\r\nI did not consider it advisable for him to be there any longer, and\r\nhanded over the command to Khan Jahan and sent for him to Court. In\r\nreality the cause of my disinclination and want of favour to him was\r\nthis. The degree of inclination and disinclination towards him in\r\nfuture will be in accordance with whatever may become clear.\r\n\r\nI favoured and promoted Sayyid `Ali Barha, who is one of our\r\ndistinguished young men, with an increase of 500 personal and 200\r\nhorse beyond his previous rank, which was 1,000 personal and 500 horse,\r\nand gave Darab Khan, son of the Khankhanan, the rank of 1,000 personal\r\nand 500 horse, with the Sarkar of Ghazipur as his jagir. Previously to\r\nthis I had had the daughter of Mirza Muzaffar Husain, son of Sultan\r\nHusain Mirza Safawi, ruler of Qandahar, betrothed to my son Sultan\r\nKhurram, and on this date, the 17th Aban, as the marriage meeting\r\nhad been arranged, I went to the house of Baba Khurram and passed the\r\nnight there. I presented most of the Amirs with robes of honour. Some\r\nof those confined in the fort of Gwalior I released, and especially\r\nHaji Mirak. Islam Khan had collected 100,000 rupees from the khalisa\r\n(directly managed) parganahs. As he was at the head of the army and the\r\nservice, I handed this over to him as a present. Giving a little gold\r\nand silver and some of every kind of jewellery and grain to trustworthy\r\nmen, I determined that they should distribute them to the poor of\r\nAgra. On the same day a report came from Khan Jahan that Iraj, the son\r\nof the Khankhanan, had obtained leave from the prince, and according\r\nto orders he had despatched him to Court. With regard to what had been\r\nordered in the case of Abu-l-fath, of Bijapur, as the above-mentioned\r\nwas an experienced man, and his being sent would cause despair to\r\nthe other Sardars of the Deccan to whom promises had been made, he\r\nhad (therefore) kept him under surveillance. [320] An order had been\r\nsent that as Kesho Das, the son of Ray Kalah(?), was in the service\r\nof Parwiz, if any impediment should occur in sending him, he (Khan\r\nJahan) should despatch him whether he wished it or not. Immediately\r\non this becoming known to Parwiz, he gave him leave and said to Khan\r\nJahan: \"These few words from my mouth thou wilt represent, that as\r\nI would give my existence and life for the service of my visible God\r\n(Jahangir), what is there in the being or annihilation of Kesho Das\r\n[321] that I should show any resistance in sending him? When they\r\n(i.e. the king) send for my confidential servants for any reason it\r\nproduces a feeling of hopelessness and disquietude of mind in the rest,\r\nand becoming known in these regions gives an idea of disfavour on the\r\npart of our lord and Qibla (place looked towards in worship). As for\r\nthe rest, it is His Majesty's order.\" From the date on which the fort\r\nof Ahmadnagar, by the efforts of my deceased brother Daniyal, came\r\ninto the possession of the heads of the victorious State, up till now,\r\nthe guardianship and preservation of that place had been entrusted to\r\nKhwaja Beg Mirza Safawi, who was a relative of the asylum of pardon\r\nShah Tahmasp. After the disturbance of the rebel Deccanis went to a\r\ngreat length, and they besieged the said fort, he had committed no\r\nfault in the duties of devotedness and holding of the fort. When\r\nthe Khankhanan and the Amirs and other leaders who had assembled\r\nat Burhanpur in waiting on Parwiz devoted themselves to the driving\r\nback and defeat of the rebels, and from the differences of opinion\r\nand quarrels of the Amirs, and the absence of provision of forage\r\nand grain, those who looked after matters of importance brought this\r\nlarge army into improper roads and among hills and difficult passes,\r\nthey in a short space of time rendered it wretched and impotent,\r\nand matters had come to such a pass and the difficulty with regard\r\nto grain was such that they were giving a life for a loaf. They then\r\nturned back helplessly with their objects unfulfilled. The garrison of\r\nthe fort, who were expecting aid from this army, on hearing this news,\r\nlost heart and stability, and tumultuously wished to vacate the fort\r\nat once. When Khwaja Beg Mirza became aware of this he endeavoured\r\nto soothe and quiet the men, but though he did his best it had\r\nno good result. At last, under an agreement, he vacated the fort,\r\nand proceeded to Burhanpur, and on the day mentioned waited on the\r\nprince. Representations with regard to his coming reached me, and,\r\nas it was clear that he had not been wanting in bravery and loyalty,\r\nI ordered his rank of 5,000 personal and horse to be confirmed and\r\na jagir to be given him. On the 9th a petition came from some of the\r\nAmirs in the Deccan that on the 22nd Sha`ban Mir Jamalu-d-din Husain\r\nhad gone to Bijapur. `Adil Khan sent his wakil forward for 20 kos,\r\nand himself received him at a distance of 3 kos, and took the Mir by\r\nthe same road to his own residence.\r\n\r\nAs the desire to hunt overcame me, at a propitious hour determined by\r\nthe astrologers, when a watch and six gharis had passed on the night\r\nof Friday, the 15th Ramazan, corresponding with the 10th Azar in the\r\n5th year (of my reign), I started to hunt, and made my first halt in\r\nthe Dahrah Garden, which is near the city. At this stage I gave Mir\r\n`Ali Akbar leave to go into the city after bestowing on him 2,000\r\nrupees and a special warm wrapper (fargul). In order that the grain\r\nand cultivation should not be trodden down by my men I ordered that\r\nall should remain in the city but the men who were actually wanted\r\nand my personal servants. Having entrusted the charge of the city\r\nto Khwaja Jahan I gave him his leave. On the 14th Sa`du-llah Khan,\r\nson of Sa`id Khan, was given an elephant. On the 28th, corresponding\r\nwith the 21st Ramazan, forty-four elephants, which Hashim Khan, son\r\nof Qasim Khan, had sent as an offering from Orissa, were produced\r\nbefore me. Of these one was very good and tame; this one I put in my\r\nprivate stud. On the 28th an eclipse (of the sun, kusuf) took place,\r\nin order to do away with the unluckiness of which I weighed myself\r\nagainst gold and silver; it came to 1,800 tolas of gold and 4,900\r\nrupees. This, along with several kinds of vegetables and sorts of\r\nanimals such as elephants and horses and cattle, I ordered to be\r\ndivided among deserving people who were unprovided for and helpless\r\npoor of the city of Agra and other cities in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nAs the affairs of the army which had been nominated for the subjugation\r\nof the Deccan under the command of Parwiz, and leadership of the\r\nKhankhanan and other high Amirs such as Raja Man Singh, Khan Jahan,\r\nAsaf Khan, the Amiru-l-umara, and other mansabdars, and other leaders\r\nof every tribe and condition, had ended in this, that they had turned\r\nback from half-way and returned to Burhanpur, and all the confidential\r\nservants and news-writers who spoke the truth had sent in reports\r\nto the Court, that although there were many causes for the ruin of\r\nthis army, yet the chief reason was the disagreement of the Amirs,\r\nespecially the treachery of the Khankhanan, it came into my mind that\r\nI must send Khan A`zam with another fresh and powerful army to make\r\namends for and set to rights some of the improper proceedings that had\r\narisen from the disagreement of the Amirs that has been described. On\r\nthe 11th of Day he (Khan A`zam) was honoured with the charge of this\r\nduty, and an order was given to the Diwans to make preparations and\r\nsend him off quickly. I appointed Khan `Alam, Faridun Khan Barlas,\r\nYusuf Khan, son of Husain Khan Tukriyah, `Ali Khan Niyazi, Baz Bahadur\r\nQalmaq, and other mansabdars, near to the number of 10,000 horse,\r\nto accompany him. It was settled that in addition to the ahadis\r\nwho were appointed to this duty 2,000 others should accompany him,\r\nmaking altogether 12,000 horse. Having sent with him thirty lakhs of\r\nrupees and several elephants, I gave him his leave and presented him\r\nwith a magnificent dress of honour, a jewelled sword-belt, a horse\r\nwith a jewelled saddle, a private elephant, and 500,000 rupees for\r\nexpenses. An order was given that the chiefs of the civil department\r\nshould recover this from his jagir. The Amirs who were under his\r\norders were honoured with robes of honour, horses, and presents. I\r\nincreased by 500 more horse the rank held by Mahabat Khan, of 4,000\r\npersonal and 3,000 horse, and ordered him to conduct Khan A`zam and\r\nthis army to Burhanpur, and having enquired into (the circumstances of)\r\nthe destruction of the army, should give the order of the appointment\r\nof the Khan A`zam to the Amirs of those regions and make them of one\r\npurpose and counsel with him. He was to see the state of preparation\r\nof the army of those parts, and after arranging all matters should\r\nbring the Khankhanan with him to Court. On Sunday, the 4th Shawwal,\r\nwhen near the end of the day, I engaged in a cheetah hunt. I had\r\ndetermined that on this day and Thursdays no animals should be killed\r\nand I would eat no meat, on Sunday especially because of the respect my\r\nrevered father had for that day in not being inclined to eat flesh on\r\nit, and in forbidding the killing of any animals for the reason that\r\non the night of Sunday his own honoured birth had taken place. He\r\nused to say it was better on that day that all animals should be\r\nfree from the calamity of those of a butcherly disposition. Thursday\r\nis the day of my accession. On that day also I ordered that animals\r\nshould not be killed, so that whilst sporting I should not shoot an\r\narrow or a gun at wild animals. In hunting with cheetahs Anup Ray,\r\nwho is one of my close attendants, was heading the men who were with\r\nhim in the hunt at a little distance [322] from me and came to a\r\ntree on which some kites were sitting. When his sight fell on those\r\nkites he took a bow and some pointless arrows (tukka) and went towards\r\nthem. By chance in the neighbourhood of that tree he saw a half-eaten\r\nbullock. Near it a huge, powerful tiger got up out of a clump that was\r\nnear and went off. Though not more than two gharis of day remained,\r\nas he knew my liking for tiger-hunting, he and some of those who\r\nwere with him surrounded the tiger and sent some one to me to give\r\nme the news. When it reached me I rode there at once in a state of\r\nexcitement and at full speed, and Baba Khurram, Ram Das, I`timad Ray,\r\nHayat Khan, and one or two others went with me. On arriving I saw the\r\ntiger standing in the shade of a tree, and wished to fire at him from\r\nhorseback but found that my horse was unsteady, and dismounted and\r\naimed and fired my gun. As I was standing on a height and the tiger\r\nbelow, I did not know whether it had struck him or not. In a moment\r\nof excitement I fired the gun again, and I think that this time I hit\r\nhim. The tiger rose and charged, and wounding the chief huntsman,\r\nwho had a falcon on his wrist and happened to be in front of him,\r\nsat down again in his own place. In this state of affairs, placing\r\nanother gun on a tripod, [323] I took aim (majra giriftam [324]). Anup\r\nRay stood holding the rest, and had a sword in his belt and a baton\r\n(kutaka) in his hand. Baba Khurram was a short distance off to my\r\nleft, and Ram Das and other servants behind him. Kamal the huntsman\r\n(qarawul) loaded the gun and placed it in my hand. When I was about\r\nto fire, the tiger came roaring towards us and charged. I immediately\r\nfired. The ball passed through the tiger's mouth and teeth. The noise\r\nof the gun made him very savage, and the servants who had crowded\r\ntogether could not stand his charge and fell over one another, so\r\nthat I, through their pushing and shock, was moved a couple of paces\r\nfrom my place and fell down. In fact, I am sure that two or three of\r\nthem placed their feet on my chest and passed over me. I`timad Ray\r\nand the huntsman Kamal assisting me, I stood up. At this moment the\r\ntiger made for those who were on the left-hand side. Anup Ray let the\r\nrest slip out of his hand and turned towards the tiger. The tiger,\r\nwith the same activity with which he had charged, turned on him,\r\nand he manfully faced him, and struck him twice with both hands on\r\nthe head with the stick he had in his hand. The tiger, opening his\r\nmouth, seized both of Anup Ray's arms with it, and bit them so that\r\nhis teeth passed through both, but the stick and the bracelets on his\r\narms were helpful, and did not allow his arms to be destroyed. From\r\nthe attack and pushing of the tiger Anup Ray fell down between\r\nthe tiger's fore-feet, so that his head and face were opposite the\r\ntiger's chest. At this moment Baba Khurram and Ram Das came up to\r\nthe assistance of Anup Ray. The prince struck the tiger on the loins\r\nwith his sword, and Ram Das also struck him twice with his sword,\r\nonce on the shoulder-blade. On the whole it was very warm work, and\r\nHayat Khan struck the tiger several blows over the head with a stick\r\nhe had in his hand. Anup Ray with force dragged his arms out of the\r\ntiger's mouth and struck him two or three times on the cheek with\r\nhis fist, and rolling over on his side stood up by the force of his\r\nknees. At the time of withdrawing his arms from the tiger's mouth,\r\nas his teeth had passed through them, they were partly torn, and\r\nboth his paws passed over his shoulders. When he stood up, the tiger\r\nalso stood up and wounded him on the chest with his claws, so that\r\nthose wounds troubled him for some days. As the ground was uneven,\r\nthey rolled over each other, holding on like two wrestlers. In the\r\nplace where I was standing the ground was quite level. Anup Ray says\r\nthat God Almighty gave him so much intelligence that he bore the tiger\r\nover deliberately to [325] one side (in the original, that side), and\r\nthat he knew no more. At this time the tiger left him and was making\r\noff. He in that state of bewilderment raised up his sword and followed\r\nhim and struck him on the head. When the tiger turned his face round,\r\nhe struck him another blow on the face, so that both his eyes were cut,\r\nand the skin of the eyebrows, which had been severed by the sword,\r\nfell over his eyes. In this state of affairs, a lamp-man of the name\r\nof Salih, as it was time to light the lamps, came in a hurry and by\r\na blind chance [326] came across the tiger. The tiger struck him one\r\nblow with his paw and knocked him down. To fall and give up his life\r\nwere the same thing. Other people came in and finished the tiger's\r\nbusiness. As Anup Ray had done this service to me and I had witnessed\r\nthe way in which he offered his life, after he had recovered from the\r\npain of his wounds and had the honour of waiting on me, I bestowed on\r\nhim the title of Anira'i Singh-dalan. Anira'i [327] they call in the\r\nHindi language the leader of an army, and the meaning of Singh-dalan\r\nis a tiger-slayer. Giving him a special sword of my own, I increased\r\nhis mansab. I gave Khurram, son of Khan A`zam, who had been appointed\r\nto the governorship of the province of Junagadh, the title of Kamil\r\nKhan. On Sunday, the 3rd Zi-l-qa`da, I employed myself in fishing,\r\nand 766 fish were caught; these were divided in my presence among the\r\nAmirs, Ibachkian (?), [328] and most of the servants. I eat no fish but\r\nthose that have scales, but not because the professors of the Shiah\r\nfaith look on those without scales as unlawful, but the cause of my\r\naversion is this, that I have heard from old men, and it has become\r\nknown to me by experience as well, that fish without scales eat the\r\nflesh of dead animals and fish with scales do not eat it. From this\r\ncause, to eat them is contrary to my disposition. The Shiahs know\r\n[329] why they do not eat them and for what reason they consider\r\nthem unlawful. One of my home-bred camels that was with me in the\r\nhunt carried five nilgaws that weighed 42 Hindustani maunds. I had\r\nbefore this sent for Naziri of Nishapur, who excelled other men in\r\nthe art of poetry, and passed his time in Gujarat as a merchant. At\r\nthis time he came and waited on me, and imitating a poem of Anwari,\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"Again, what youth and beauty this is for the world!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nlaid before me a poem that he had composed on me. I presented him\r\nwith 1,000 rupees, a horse, and a robe of honour as a gift for this\r\npoem. I had also sent for Hakim Hamid Gujarati, whom Murtaza Khan\r\ngreatly praised, and he came and waited on me. His good qualities\r\nand purity were better than his doctoring. He waited on me for some\r\ntime. When it became known that there was no physician but himself in\r\nGujarat, and I found he himself desired leave to go, I gave him and his\r\nsons 1,000 rupees and some shawls, and set aside a whole village for\r\nhis maintenance; he went off to his native place quite happy. Yusuf\r\nKhan, son of Husain Khan Tukriyah, came from his jagir and waited on\r\nme. On Thursday, the 10th Zi-l-hijja, was the festival of the Qurban\r\n(the sacrifice of Ishmael). As it is forbidden to take life on that\r\nday (Thursday), I ordered that on the Friday they should kill the\r\nsacrificial animals. Having sacrificed three sheep with my own hand,\r\nI mounted to go hunting, and returned when six gharis of night had\r\npassed. On this day was killed a nilgaw (commonly called blue bull)\r\nof the weight of 9 maunds and 35 seers. The story of this nilgaw is\r\nwritten because it is not devoid of strangeness. In the two past years,\r\nduring which I had come to this same place to wander about and hunt I\r\nhad shot at him each time with a gun. As the wounds were not in a fatal\r\nplace, he had not fallen, but gone off. This time again I saw that\r\nnilgaw in the hunting-ground (shikargah), and the watchman recognized\r\nthat in the two previous years he had gone away wounded. In short, I\r\nfired at him again three times on that day. It was in vain. I pursued\r\nhim rapidly on foot for three kos, but however much I exerted myself\r\nI could not catch him. At last I made a vow that if this nilgaw fell\r\nI would have his flesh cooked, and for the soul of Khwaja Mu`inu-d-din\r\nwould give it to eat to poor people. I also vowed a muhr and one rupee\r\nto my revered father. Soon after this the nilgaw became worn out with\r\nmoving, and I ran to his head and ordered them to make it lawful (cut\r\nits throat in the name of Allah) on the spot, and having brought it to\r\nthe camp I fulfilled my vow as I had proposed. They cooked the nilgaw,\r\nand expending the muhr and rupee on sweets. I assembled poor and hungry\r\npeople and divided them among them in my own presence. Two or three\r\ndays afterwards I saw another nilgaw. However much I exerted myself\r\nand wished he would stand still in one place, so that I might fire\r\nat him, I could get no chance. With my gun on my shoulder I followed\r\nhim till near evening until it was sunset, and despaired of killing\r\nhim. Suddenly it came across my tongue, \"Khwaja, this nilgaw also\r\nis vowed to you.\" My speaking and his sitting down were at one and\r\nthe same moment. I fired at and hit him, and ordered him, like the\r\nfirst nilgaw, to be cooked and given to the poor to eat. On Saturday,\r\nthe 19th Zi-l-hijja, I fished again. This time about 330 fish were\r\ncaught. On the night of Wednesday, the 28th [330] of the same month,\r\nI encamped at Rupbas. As this was one of my fixed hunting-places\r\nand there was an order that no one should hunt in the neighbourhood,\r\na great number of antelope had come together in the desert there, so\r\nmuch so that they came into the inhabited parts and were not subject\r\nto any kind of molestation. I hunted for two or three days in those\r\ndesert plains, and shot, and hunted with cheetahs many antelopes. As\r\nthe hour for entering the city was near, making two halts on the way,\r\nI alighted on the night of Thursday, the 2nd Muharram, in the year 1020\r\n(17th March, 1611), at the garden of `Abdu-r-Razzaq Ma`muri, which is\r\nnear, in fact close to, the city. On this night many of the servants\r\nof the Court, such as Khwaja Jahan, Daulat Khan, and a number who had\r\nremained in the city, came and waited on me. Iraj also, whom I had\r\nsent for from the Subah of the Deccan, had the honour of kissing the\r\nthreshold. I stayed in that garden also on the Friday. On that day\r\n`Abdu-r-Razzaq presented his own offerings. As this was the last day\r\nfor hunting, an order was given that the duration of the hunt and the\r\nnumber of animals killed should be counted up to me. The time of the\r\nhunt was from the 9th of the month of Azar to the 29th Isfandarmuz of\r\nthe 5th year, or three months and twenty days. In this time tigers\r\n12, deer (gawzan) 1, chikarah (gazelle) 44, kutah-pacha (hog-deer)\r\n1 head, fawns 2 head, black buck 68 head, does 31 head, foxes 4,\r\nkurara deer 8, patal (?) 1, bears 5, hyænas 3, hares 6, nilgaw 108,\r\nfish 1,096, eagle 1, bustard 1, peafowl 5, herons 5, partridges 5,\r\nbrahmini ducks (surkhab) 1, saras 5, dhik (?) 1; total, 1,414.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, the 29th Isfandarmuz, corresponding to the 4th Muharram,\r\nI mounted an elephant and went to the city. From the garden of\r\n`Abdu-r-Razzaq to the palace the distance is a kos and 20 tanab. I\r\nscattered 1,500 rupees to the crowd. At the fixed hour I entered the\r\npalace. The bazars had been decorated with cloths after the manner of\r\nthe New Year's feast. As at the hunting-time an order had been given\r\nto Khwaja Jahan to prepare in the Mahall (Zenanah) a building fit for\r\nme to sit in, the said Khwaja had in the space of three months prepared\r\nand brought to perfection this kind of lofty building, and with folded\r\nhands (in humility) had done exceedingly active work. Coming off\r\nthe dust of the road I entered that Paradise-like building and went\r\nto look round that abode, and it was very much to my taste. Khwaja\r\nJahan was dignified with much praise and commendation. The offerings\r\nhe had prepared were displayed to me in the same building. Some of\r\nthese were approved and accepted and the remainder presented to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SIXTH NEW YEAR'S FEAST AFTER MY AUSPICIOUS ACCESSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo gharis and forty seconds of day had passed on the Monday when the\r\nsun (lit. his honour the greatest star) entered his tower of honour,\r\nwhich is in the constellation of Aries. That day was the 1st Farwardin,\r\ncorresponding with the 6th Muharram [331] (21st March, 1611). The feast\r\nof the New Year having been prepared, I seated myself on the throne\r\nof good fortune. The Amirs and all the servants of the Court enjoyed\r\nthe good fortune of waiting on me and gave their congratulations. The\r\nofferings of the servants of the Court Miran Sadr Jahan, `Abdu-llah\r\nKhan Firuz-jang, and Jahangir Quli Khan, were laid before me. On\r\nWednesday, the 8th Muharram, the offering of Raja Kalyan, who had\r\nsent it from Bengal, was laid before me. On Thursday, the 9th of\r\nthe same month, Shaja`at Khan and some of the mansabdars, who had\r\ncome on summons from the Deccan, waited on me. I gave a jewelled\r\nwaist-dagger to Razzaq-wirdi Uzbeg. On the same day the New Year's\r\noffering of Murtaza Khan was laid before me. He had prepared all\r\nkinds of things. Having inspected all these, I took what I approved\r\nin the shape of valuable jewels, fine cloths, elephants, and horses\r\nand gave back the rest. I presented a jewelled dagger to Abu-l-fath\r\nDakhani, 3,000 rupees to Mir `Abdu-llah, and an Iraq horse to Muqim\r\nKhan. I increased the rank of Shaja`at Khan, which was 1,500 personal\r\nand 100 horse, by 500 personal and horse. I had summoned him from\r\nthe Deccan for the purpose of sending him to Bengal to Islam Khan,\r\nin reality to take his place permanently, and I entrusted him with\r\nthe charge of that Subah. Khwaja Abu-l-hasan laid before me (as\r\nofferings) two rubies, one royal pearl, and ten rings. I gave Iraj,\r\nthe son of Khankhanan, a jewelled dagger. The rank of Khurram was 8,000\r\npersonal and 5,000 horse; I increased his personal allowance by 2,000,\r\nand increased that of Khwaja Jahan, which was 1,500 personal, 1,000\r\nhorse by 500 personal, 200 horse. On 24th Muharram, 18th Farwardin,\r\nthe day of the ascendant, Yadgar `Ali Sultan, ambassador of Shah\r\n`Abbas, ruler of Persia, who had come on a visit of condolence on\r\nthe death of the late king and with congratulations on my accession,\r\nhad the honour of waiting on me, and laid before me the gifts Shah\r\n`Abbas, my brother, had sent. He had brought good horses, cloth stuffs,\r\nand every kind of fitting present. After he had presented the gifts,\r\non the same day I gave him a superb robe of honour and 30,000 rupees,\r\nwhich were equivalent to 1,000 Persian tumans. He handed me a letter\r\nin which were mingled congratulations and condolences for the death\r\nof my revered father. As in the letter of congratulation he expressed\r\nthe greatest friendship, and omitted no point of regard and concord,\r\nit has pleased me to enter here an exact copy of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCopy of the letter of Shah `Abbas.\r\n\r\n\"May the sprinklings of the cloud of the grace of God and the\r\ndropping of the favour of the Almighty impart freshness to the\r\ngardens of wonderful men and inventors (of new things)! May the\r\nflower-bed of sovereignty and rule and the mead of magnificence\r\nand exalted happiness of his Honour of heavenly dignity, of sun-like\r\ngrandeur, the king whose fortune is young, of Saturn-like majesty, the\r\nrenowned prince, possessing the authority of the spheres, the Khedive,\r\nthe world-gripper (Jahangir) and country-conquering sovereign, the\r\nprince of the exaltedness of Sikandar, with the banner of Darius,\r\nhe who sits on the throne of the pavilion of greatness and glory,\r\nthe possessor of the (seven) climes, the increaser of the joys of\r\ngood fortune and prosperity, adorner of the gardens of happiness,\r\ndecorator of the rose-parterre, lord of the happy conjunction (of the\r\nplanets), the opener of the countenance, the perfection of kinghood,\r\nexpounder of the mysteries of the sky, the adornment of the face of\r\nlearning and insight, index of the book of creation, compendium of\r\nhuman perfections, mirror of the glory of God, elevator of the lofty\r\nsoul, increaser of good fortune and of the beneficent ascension,\r\nsun of the grandeur of the skies, the shadow of the benignity of the\r\nCreator, he who has the dignity of Jamshid among the stars of the\r\nhost of heaven, lord of conjunction, refuge of the world, river of the\r\nfavours of Allah, and fountain of unending mercy, verdure of the plain\r\nof purity, may his land (lit. surface) be guarded from the calamity of\r\nthe evil eye; may his fountain of perfection be preserved in truth,\r\nhis desire and love; the tale of his good qualities and benevolence\r\ncannot be written.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"'The pen has not the tongue to express the secret of love.'\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough outwardly the distance (between us) prevents my attaining\r\nto the ka`bah of desire, yet he is the qiblah of my keen longing\r\nfor spiritual intercourse. Thank God that by virtue of essential\r\noneness this humble supplicant and that pure nursling of glory have in\r\nreality been united to one another. The distance of space and outward\r\nseparation of the body not having prevented nearness of soul and\r\nspiritual union, my face is still towards friendship, and accordingly\r\nthe dust of sorrow has not settled on the sun-like mirror of my mind,\r\nbut it has received the reflection of the beauty of that exhibitor of\r\nperfection, and the olfactory of my soul has been ever scented with\r\nthe sweet savour of friendship and love and the ambergris-perfumed\r\nbreezes of affection and concord, and spiritual fellowship and\r\nperpetual union have rubbed off the rust from friendship.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"'I sit beside thee in thought, and my heart is at ease,\r\n    For this is an union not followed by separation's pain.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Praise be given to the most mighty and pure God that the plant of\r\nthe desire of true friends hath borne the fruit of fruition. Success\r\n(maqsud), that beauty who for years was hidden behind the veil, has\r\nby dint of humility and supplication at the throne of the Almighty,\r\ncome forth and manifested herself from the hidden bridal chamber,\r\nand a ray of perfection has been thrown on the plain of the hopes\r\nof the expectants; she has ascended the auspicious throne and seated\r\nherself beside the king who adorns the assembly and enhances the glory\r\nof the tribune of the king of kings. The world-opening standard of\r\nthe Caliphate and rule, and the sky-scraping umbrella of justice and\r\nworld-sway of that creator of the diadem and throne, and that opener\r\nof the knots of knowledge and wisdom have cast the shade of equity\r\nand sovereignty and mercy over the heads of the inhabitants of the\r\nworld. My hope is that the chief of desire-granters may make the\r\nauspicious ascension of that blessed rising of fortune brighten the\r\ncrown and illuminate the throne, making it of good omen and prosperous\r\nto all, and may the things that appertain to kingship and rule of\r\nthe world and the causes of dignity and prosperity be ever on the\r\nincrease! For long past the customs of amity and the ways of intimacy,\r\nwhich have been in existence between our ancestors, and now freshly\r\nhave been re-established between this one who is bent on friendship\r\nand him who is intent on equity, demanded that when the good news of\r\nthe accession of him who sits on the Gurgani throne and is the heir of\r\nthe crown of Timur reached this country, one of the confidants of the\r\nroyal palace should be quickly nominated to convey congratulations,\r\nbut inasmuch as the business of Azarbijan and the conquest of the\r\nprovince of Shirwan just then occurred, and until my loving mind was\r\nsatisfied as to the affairs of that province, I could not return to my\r\ncapital, some delay took place in the accomplishment of this important\r\nduty. Although outward ceremonial observances and politenesses have\r\nnot much weight with people of knowledge and discernment, yet the\r\nobservance of them is the observance of the dues of friendship. Of\r\nnecessity, therefore, at this auspicious time when the attention of\r\nthe servants of holy angels (?) has been withdrawn from the affairs\r\nof that province, which have been arranged in accordance with the\r\ndesires of my well-wishers, and I am at ease in that quarter, I\r\nhave returned and settled down in my capital of Isfahan, which is\r\nthe permanent seat of rule. Therefore I have despatched Kamalu-d-din\r\nYadgar `Ali, who possesses the attributes of nobility, is perfect in\r\nsincerity and fully reliable, who is moreover of the number of devoted\r\nservants and Sufis of pure design of our family, to the most exalted\r\nCourt, that after he has obtained the good fortune to salute you,\r\nto condole with you, and kissed the carpet of honour, and performed\r\nthe dues of inquiry (after health, etc.) and congratulations, he may\r\nobtain leave to return, and may convey to the sincere mind of your\r\nwell-wisher the good tidings of the safety of your angelic person\r\nand the health of your temperament that is of the brightness of\r\nthe sun and increases joy. It is hoped that the tree of hereditary\r\nfriendship and assiduousness, and the garden of intimacy and regard,\r\nboth apparent and spiritual, which by the irrigation of the rivers of\r\naffection and the brooks of sincere regard acquire great splendour\r\nand greenness, not casting their leaves, may set in motion the cord\r\nof intimacy and drive away the misfortune of estrangement by the\r\narrival of correspondence, which is the communication of the soul,\r\nand may connect by spiritual chains our visible friendship, and may\r\nfavour the course and accomplishment of business.\r\n\r\n\"May God Almighty give the assistance of the secret powers to that\r\nliving family of dignity and glory and that household of grandeur\r\nand good fortune.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUp to this is the copy of the letter of my brother Shah `Abbas.\r\n\r\nMy brothers Sultan Murad and Daniyal, who had died in the lifetime of\r\nmy revered father, people had called by several names. I ordered that\r\none of them should be called Shahzada maghfur (the pardoned prince),\r\nand the other Shahzada marhum (the prince admitted to mercy). I\r\npromoted I`timadu-d-daulah and `Abdu-r-Razzaq Ma`muri, who each held\r\nthe rank of 1,500, to that of 1,800, and increased the horse-rank of\r\nQasim Khan, brother of Islam Khankhanan, by 250. I dignified Iraj,\r\neldest son of the Khankhanan, with the title of Shah-nawaz Khan, and\r\nSa`du-llah, son of Sa`id Khan, with the appellation of Nawazish Khan.\r\n\r\nAt the time of my accession I had increased weights and measures\r\n(lit. gaz), viz. to the extent of three ratis (small weight equal to\r\neight barleycorns), in the weight of muhrs and rupees. At this time\r\nit was represented to me that in mercantile transactions it would be\r\nfor the convenience of the people that muhrs and rupees should be of\r\nthe same weight as previously. As in all affairs the contentment and\r\nease of the people are to be looked to, I gave an order that from the\r\npresent day, that is, the 11th Urdibihisht in the 6th year of my reign,\r\nthey should strike muhrs and rupees of the former weight in all the\r\nmints of my dominions. As before this, on Saturday, the 2nd of the\r\nmonth of Safar, in the year 1020, the evil-dispositioned Ahdad had\r\nheard that Kabul was deprived of an eminent leader, that Khan Dauran\r\n[332] was in the interior, and only Mu`izzu-l-mulk with a few servants\r\nof the aforesaid was in Kabul, thinking it a good opportunity he\r\n(Ahdad) betook himself unexpectedly to Kabul with a large number of\r\nhorsemen and foot-soldiers. Mu`izzu-l-mulk, according to the measure of\r\nhis ability, displayed activity, and the Kabulis and other inhabitants,\r\nespecially the Farmuli [333] tribe, barricaded up the streets and\r\nfortified their houses. The Afghans with some guns came in to the\r\nstreets and bazars from different directions. The people from the\r\nshelter of their terraces and houses killed many of these wretches with\r\narrows and guns, and Bargi, [334] one of the confidential leaders of\r\nAhdad, was killed. From the occurrence of this affair, for fear that\r\nthe people from all sides and quarters should assemble and block the\r\nroad for them to get out, giving up their hearts and feet (in a state\r\nof distraction), in fear and confusion they turned back. About 800 of\r\nthose dogs went to jahannam (hell), and 200, having caught horses,\r\nhastily escaped with their lives from that deadly place. Nad `Ali\r\nMaidani, who was in Lahugar, at last on the same day arrived there,\r\nand pursued them for a short distance. As the distance (between them)\r\nwas too great and his band small, he turned back. For the energy\r\nhe had shown in coming quickly, and for the activity displayed by\r\nMu`izzu-l-mulk, they were both promoted in rank; Nad `Ali, who held\r\nthat of 1,000 personal to that of 1,500, and Mu`izzu-l-mulk, who held\r\nthe rank of 1,500, to 1,800. As it transpired that Khan Dauran and\r\nthe Kabulis were in the habit of passing their days in carelessness,\r\nand the repelling of the evil disposition of Ahdad had taken a long\r\ntime it occurred to me that as the Khankhanan was without employment\r\nI might appoint him and his sons to this duty. Soon after this idea\r\noccurred, Qilij Khan, to summon whom a firman had already been issued,\r\ncame from the Panjab and obtained the honour of an audience. It became\r\nevident from the forehead of his circumstances (his manner) that he\r\nwas annoyed at the duty of driving back the ill-dispositioned Ahdad\r\nbeing assigned to Khankhanan. As he faithfully promised to take up\r\nthis duty, it was settled that the governorship of the Subah of the\r\nPanjab should belong to Murtaza Khan, and that the Khankhanan should\r\nremain at home, and that Qilij Khan should be promoted to the rank of\r\n6,000 personal and 5,000 horse, and be appointed to Kabul to drive back\r\nAhdad and the up-country robbers. I ordered the Khankhanan to have a\r\njagir in the Subah of Agra in the Sarkars of Qanauj and Kalpi, that\r\nhe might inflict condign punishment on the rebels of that region and\r\nexterminate them (pull them out by the roots). When I dismissed them\r\nI gave each of them special robes of honour and horses and elephants,\r\nand having received the robes of exaltation they started off. At the\r\nsame time, on account of the sincerity of his friendship and his old\r\nservices, I bestowed on I`timadu-d-daulah the rank of 2,000 personal\r\nand 500 horse, and presented him with a sum of 5,000 rupees by way of\r\ngift. Mahabat Khan, whom I had sent to make the necessary preparations\r\nfor war for the victorious army of the Deccan and point out to the\r\nAmirs the desirability of concord and unanimity, paid his respects to\r\nme at the capital of Agra on the 12th of the month of Tir, the 21st\r\nof Rabi`u-s-sani. It was brought to notice in a letter from Islam\r\nKhan that `Inayat Khan had performed approved service in the Subah of\r\nBengal; on this account I increased by 500 personal the rank he already\r\nheld of 2,000. I also increased by 500 personal and 300 horse, so as\r\nto make it up altogether to 1,500 personal and 800 horse, the rank of\r\nRaja Kalyan, who was one of the officials of that Subah. I appointed\r\nHashim Khan, [335] who was in Orissa, to the government of Kashmir,\r\nand sent his uncle, Khwaja Muhammad Husain, there to look after the\r\naffairs of that country until his arrival. In the time of my revered\r\nfather his father, Muhammad Qasim, had conquered Kashmir. Chin Qilij,\r\nwho was the eldest son of Qilij Khan, came from the Subah of Kabul\r\nand waited on me. As in addition to his natural excellence he was\r\na khanazad (houseborn one), he was honoured with the title of Khan,\r\nand according to the prayer of his father, and on condition of his\r\nundertaking service in Tirah, I increased his rank by 500 personal\r\nand 300 horse. On the 14th Amardad on account of the previous service\r\nand great sincerity and ability of I`timadu-daulah, I bestowed on him\r\nthe high rank of the viziership of the kingdom, and on the same day\r\npresented a belt with a jewelled dagger to Yadgar `Ali, ambassador\r\nof the ruler of Iran. As `Abdu-llah Khan, who had been appointed\r\nto command the army against the rebel Rana, promised to enter the\r\nprovince of the Deccan from the direction of Gujarat, I promoted him\r\nto be Subahdar of that province, and at his request appointed Raja\r\nBaso to the command of the army against the Rana, increasing his rank\r\nby 500 horse. In place of Gujarat I conferred the Subah of Malwa\r\non Khan A`zam and sent 400,000 rupees to provide for the army and\r\nwarlike materials for the force that had been appointed to accompany\r\n`Abdu-llah Khan by way of Nasik, which is near the province of the\r\nDeccan. Safdar Khan, with his brothers, came from the Subah of Behar,\r\nand had the honour of kissing the threshold.\r\n\r\nOne of the royal slaves who was serving in the seal-cutting departments\r\nprepared and laid before me a design such as I had never seen or heard\r\nof before. As it is exceedingly strange, a detailed [336] description\r\nof it is given. In the shell of a filbert four compartments had been\r\ncarved out of ivory. The first compartment was one of wrestlers, in\r\nwhich two men were engaged in wrestling, a third was standing with\r\na spear in his hand, a fourth with a hard stone. [337] Another was\r\nsitting with his hands placed on the ground, while in front of him\r\nwere laid a piece of wood, a bow and a pot. In the second a throne had\r\nbeen made above which a shamiyana (a tent-fly or canopy) was depicted,\r\nand a man of wealth (a prince) was seated on the throne with one leg\r\nplaced over the other and a pillow at his back. Five servants were\r\nstanding around and before him, and tree-boughs threw a shade over\r\nthe throne. In the third compartment is a company of rope-dancers,\r\nwho have raised upright a pole with three ropes fastened to it. A\r\nrope-dancer upon it (qu. on the ropes? [338]) has taken hold of his\r\nown right foot with his left hand behind his head, and standing on\r\none foot has placed a goat on the top of the pole. Another person has\r\nthrown a drum on his neck and is beating it, whilst another man is\r\nstanding with his hands lifted up and looking at the rope-dancer. Five\r\nother men are also standing, of whom one has a stick in his hand. In\r\nthe fourth compartment there is a tree, below which the figure of\r\nthe revered (hazrat) Jesus is shown. One person has placed his head\r\nat Jesus' feet, and an old man is conversing with Jesus and four\r\nothers are standing by. [339] As he had made such a masterpiece,\r\nI honoured him with a present and with increased salary.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th Shahriwar, Mirza Sultan, who had been sent for from the\r\nDeccan, came and waited on me. Safdar Khan had an increase of rank\r\nconferred on him, and was appointed to go to the assistance of the\r\narmy against the rebel Rana. As `Abdu-llah Khan Bahadur Firuz-jang\r\nhad proposed to enter the neighbouring province of the Deccan by way\r\nof Nasik, it occurred to me to appoint Ram Das Kachhwaha, who was\r\none of the sincere servants of my revered father, to accompany him\r\nin order that he might in every place look after him, and not allow\r\nhim to be too rash and hasty. For this purpose I bestowed on him great\r\nfavours, as well as the title of Raja, which he had not thought of for\r\nhimself. I also gave him drums and the fort of Ranthanbur, which is\r\none of the noted castles in Hindustan, and honouring him with a superb\r\nrobe of honour and an elephant and horse I dismissed him. I appointed\r\nKhwaja Abu-l-hasan, who had been transferred from the chief Diwanship,\r\nto the duty of the Subahdarship of the Deccan, as he had been for\r\na long time in those regions in the service of my deceased brother\r\n(Daniyal). I honoured Abu-l-hasan, son of I`timadu-d-daulah, with the\r\ntitle of I`tiqad Khan, and having promoted the sons of Mu`azzam Khan\r\nto fitting ranks sent them to Bengal to Islam Khan. At the request\r\nof Islam Khan, Raja Kalyan was appointed to the government of the\r\nSarkar of Orissa and had an increase in rank of 200 personal and\r\nhorse. I presented Shaja`at Khan Dakhani with 4,000 rupees. On the\r\n7th Aban Badi`u-z-zaman, son of Mirza Shahrukh, came from the Deccan\r\nand waited on me.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, in consequence of the disturbances that had occurred\r\nin the country of Mawara'a-n-nahr, many of the Amirs and Uzbeg\r\nsoldiers, such as Husain Bi, Pahluwan Baba, and Nauras Bi Darman,\r\nand Baram Bi and others came to Court and waited on me. They were all\r\nhonoured with robes of honour, horses, cash, mansabs, and jagirs. On\r\nthe 2nd Azar Hashim Khan came from Bengal and had the honour of\r\nkissing my threshold. I sent 500,000 rupees for the expenses of the\r\nvictorious army of the Deccan, of which the leader was `Abdu-llah\r\nKhan, to Ahmadabad in Gujarat by the hands of Rup Khawass and Shaikh\r\nAnbiya. On the 1st day I went to the village of Samonagar, which is one\r\nof my fixed hunting-places, to hunt. Twenty-two antelope were killed,\r\nof which I myself killed sixteen and Khurram the other six. Remaining\r\nthere two days and two nights, on the night of Sunday I returned to\r\nthe city in health and safety, and one night this couplet threw its\r\nbrilliance on my mind:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"As long as there's in heaven light for the sun,\r\n    Be not the reflection far from the Shah's umbrella.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI ordered the lamplighters and the relators of stories that at the\r\ntime of their salutations and telling stories they should commence\r\nwith this couplet, and it is still in use. On Saturday, the 3rd day,\r\na letter came from Khan A`zam that `Adil Khan Bijapuri had given\r\nup his evil ways and become penitent, and in the rank of servants\r\nwas now more loyal than ever. On the 14th day, corresponding with\r\nthe last day of Shawwal, leave was given to Hashim Khan to go to\r\nKashmir. I gave a special wrapper [340] (fargal) to Yadgar `Ali,\r\nambassador of Persia. I presented I`tiqad Khan with one of my special\r\nswords called Sar-andaz (thrower of heads). Having honoured Shadman,\r\nson of Khan A`zam, with the title of Shadman Khan, I increased his\r\nrank to 1,700 personal and 500 horse. He was also honoured with a\r\nstandard. Sardar Khan, brother of `Abdu-llah Khan Firuz-jang, and\r\nArslan Bi Uzbeg, who had been appointed to the charge of Sivistan,\r\n[341] were also presented with standards. I ordered that ja'i-namaz\r\n(prayer carpets) should be made of the skins of the antelopes I had\r\nmyself killed, and be kept in the public audience hall for people to\r\nuse in saying their prayers. By way of special respect to the Law I\r\nordered that the Mir-i-`Adl and Qazi, who are the pivot of affairs\r\nof the divine law, should not kiss the ground (before me), which is a\r\nkind of sijda. On Thursday, the 22nd day, I went again to Samonagar to\r\nhunt. As many antelope had collected together in that neighbourhood I\r\nhad this time sent off Khwaja Jahan to prepare a qamargah and drive in\r\nthe antelope into a broad place from all sides, to place canvas-walls\r\n(sara-parda) and a gulal-bar [342] round it. They enclosed a kos and\r\nhalf of ground with sarapardas. When news came that the hunting-place\r\nhad been prepared and a great deal of game had been confined, I went\r\nthere and began to hunt on the Friday. Until the next Thursday I\r\nwent every day to the qamargah with the ladies and hunted as much\r\nas I liked. Some of the deer were taken alive and some killed with\r\narrows and guns. On the Sunday and Thursday, on which I do not fire\r\nguns at animals, they took them alive in nets. In these seven days\r\n917 head, male and female, were caught, and of these 641 deer were\r\ncaught alive. Four hundred and four head were sent to Fathpur to\r\nbe let loose on the plain there, and with regard to 84 I ordered\r\nthem to put silver rings in their noses and set them free in the\r\nsame place. The 276 other antelope that had been killed with guns\r\nand arrows and by cheetahs were divided from day to day among the\r\nBegams and the slaves of the palace, and Amirs and servants of the\r\npalace. As I became very tired (dilgir) of hunting, I gave orders to\r\nthe Amirs to go to the shikargah (hunting-place) and hunt all that\r\nwere left over, and myself returned in safety to the city. On the\r\n1st Bahman, corresponding with the 17th Zi-l-qa`da, I ordered that in\r\nthe large cities of my dominions, like Ahmadabad, Allahabad, Lahore,\r\nDelhi, Agra, etc., they should arrange bulghur-khanas (places for the\r\ndistribution of cooked food) for the poor; thirty mahalls (districts)\r\nhad been ordered. Six had already been established, and twenty-four\r\nother districts were now ordered. On the 4th Bahman I increased the\r\nrank of Raja Bir Singh Deo by 1,000 personal; it was previously 4,000\r\npersonal and 2,000 horse: I gave him a jewelled sword. Another sword\r\nout of my special ones, that was called Shah-bacha, (king's child), was\r\npresented to Shah-nawaz Khan. On the 16th Isfandarmuz, Badi`u-z-zaman,\r\nson of Mirza Shahrukh, was appointed to the army against the rebel Rana\r\nand a sword sent by his hand for Raja Baso. Having again heard that\r\nthe Amirs on the borders interfere with authority in matters that do\r\nnot concern them, and do not observe laws and regulations, I ordered\r\n[343] that the Bakhshis should circulate orders, to be obeyed amongst\r\nthe Amirs of the borders, that hereafter they should not interfere\r\nin such things, which are the private affair of kings. The first\r\nthing is this, that they should not sit in the jharokha (private\r\nwindow), and should not trouble their officers and captains of the\r\nauxiliaries with keeping guard or saluting them, and should not have\r\nelephant fights, and should not inflict the punishment of blinding,\r\nand should not cut off ears and noses, and should not force Islam on\r\nanyone, and should not confer titles on their servants, and should not\r\norder the royal servants to do kurnish or prostration, and should not\r\nforce singers to remain on duty in the manner customary in (royal)\r\ndarbars, and should not beat drums when they go out, and when they\r\ngive a horse or elephant to anyone, whether to the king's attendants\r\nor to their own servants, they should not place reins or elephant's\r\ngoads on their backs and make them perform obeisance. In going in\r\nprocession they should not take with them on foot in their retinue\r\nthe royal attendants. If they write anything to them they should not\r\nput a seal on it. [344] The regulations which have been styled the\r\nrules of Jahangir (Ayin-i-Jahangiri) are now in force. [345]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEVENTH NEW YEAR'S FESTIVAL AFTER THE AUSPICIOUS ACCESSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the 1st Farwardin of the seventh year from my accession\r\non the 16th Muharram u-l-haram (19th March, 1612) in the year 1021,\r\nthe New Year's assembly that illuminates the world, and the festival\r\nthat brings joy, were held in the capital of Agra. After four gharis\r\nof the night had passed on Thursday, the 3rd of the aforesaid month,\r\nthe hour that the astrologers had chosen, I sat on the throne. I\r\nhad ordered that, according to annual custom, the bazars should\r\nbe decorated and the assembly should be kept up until the day of\r\nculmination (ruz-i-sharaf). Khusrau Bi Uzbeg, who was known among\r\nthe Uzbegs as Khusrau Qimchi, [346] came on these days and had the\r\nhonour of waiting on me. As he was one of the influential men of\r\nMawara'a-n-nahr, I bestowed many favours on him, and gave him a fine\r\nrobe of honour. I gave 15,000 rupees to Yadgar `Ali, ambassador of\r\nthe ruler of Iran, for his expenses. On the same day the offering\r\nof Afzal Khan, which he had sent from the Subah of Behar, was\r\nlaid before me. There were 30 elephants and 18 ponies (gunth), and\r\npieces of Bengal cloth, sandalwood, some pods of musk, aloes-wood\r\n(Agallochum), and all kinds of things. The offering of Khan Dauran\r\nwas also produced before me. He had sent 45 head of horse and two\r\nstrings of camels, porcelain from China, dressing-gowns (pustinha\r\n[347]) of sable (sammur), and other valuable presents procurable in\r\nKabul and its neighbourhood. The officers of the palace had taken\r\ntrouble about their offerings, and according to the yearly custom from\r\nday to day of the festival the offerings of the servants were laid\r\nbefore me. Having looked at them in detail, I took what I approved\r\nand gave them the remainder. On the 13th Farwardin, corresponding\r\nwith the 29th Muharram, a representation from Islam Khan arrived to\r\nthe effect that through the blessing of Allah's favour and through\r\nthe benign influence of the royal grace, Bengal had been freed from\r\nthe disturbance of `Usman, the Afghan. Before the circumstances of\r\nthis war are written down, some particulars with regard to Bengal\r\nwill be recorded. [348] Bengal is a country of great extent, and in\r\nthe second clime its length, from the port of Chittagong to Gari, is\r\n450 kos; and its breadth, from the Northern hills to the boundary of\r\nSarkar Madaran, 220 kos. Its revenue is about 60 krores of dams. [349]\r\nThe former rulers of this place always had 20,000 horse, a lakh of\r\nfoot-soldiers, 1,000 elephants, and 4,000 or 5,000 war-boats. From\r\nthe time of Shir Khan and his son Salim Khan, this country was in the\r\npossession of the Afghans. When the throne of sovereignty of Hindustan\r\nin the hands of my revered father acquired beauty and splendour,\r\nhe ordered the victorious forces (of the empire) into it, and for\r\na long time made the conquest of it his object, until the aforesaid\r\nprovince, through the great efforts of the chiefs of the victorious\r\nState, passed from the possession of Da'ud Karani, who was the last\r\nof its rulers. That wretch was killed in the fight with Khan Jahan,\r\nand his army became scattered and in desperate condition. From that\r\ndate until now the province is in the possession of the servants of\r\nthe State. In the end a few of the remaining Afghans had remained in\r\nthe corners and sides of the country, and kept a few distant places in\r\ntheir possession, until, by degrees, most of that body became despised\r\nand helpless, and were captured by the chiefs of the State in the\r\nplaces of which they had still possession. When the arrangement of\r\nthe affairs of rule and empire, simply through the grace of God,\r\nbecame entrusted to this humble servant of the throne of Allah,\r\nin the first year after my accession I sent for Raja Man Singh,\r\nwho had been appointed to the rule and government of that place,\r\nto Court, and sent Qutbu-d-din Khan, who, out of all the officials,\r\nwas distinguished as my foster-brother, in his place. As he entered\r\nthe province he attained to martyrdom at the hand of one of those\r\nmischievous ones who had been appointed to that country, and that\r\nman, who had not thought of the consequences, also obtained the\r\nreward of his deeds, and was slain. I promoted Jahangir Quli Khan,\r\nwho was governor and a Jagirdar in the province of Behar, on account\r\nof his nearness to that neighbourhood, to the rank of 5,000 personal\r\nand horse, and ordered him to go to Bengal and take possession of\r\nthe province. I sent an order to Islam Khan, who was at the capital\r\nof Agra, to go to Behar and consider that province his jagir. When\r\na short time had passed under the rule of Jahangir Quli Khan, he\r\ncontracted a severe illness, in consequence of the bad water and\r\nair of that place, and by degrees the power of the disease and his\r\nweakness became so great as to end in his destruction. When the news\r\nof his death came to my hearing at Lahore, an order was issued in the\r\nname of Islam Khan to proceed as soon as possible to Bengal. When I\r\nappointed him to this important duty, most of the servants of the State\r\nmade remarks on his youth and want of experience. As the excellence\r\nof his disposition and his natural capacity had been noticed by my\r\njudicious eye, I myself chose him for this duty. As it happened, the\r\naffairs of this province were carried on by him in such a manner as\r\nfrom the time when it first entered into the possession of the Chiefs\r\nof the everlasting State until this day has never been attained to\r\nby any of the servants of the Court. One of his noteworthy deeds\r\nwas the driving away of the rebel `Usman, the Afghan. He frequently\r\nin the time of the late king encountered the royal forces, but his\r\nexpulsion was not accomplished. When Islam Khan made Dhaka (Dacca)\r\nhis place of abode and made the subjection of the Zamindars of that\r\nneighbourhood his chief object, it occurred to him that he should\r\nsend an army against the rebel `Usman and his province. If he agreed\r\nto serve loyally, well and good, but if not, they should punish and\r\nannihilate him like other seditious people. At that time Shaja`at\r\nKhan [350] joined Islam Khan, and the lot of leading in this service\r\n[351] fell on his name. Several others of the State servants were\r\nalso appointed to go with him, such as Kishwar Khan, Iftikhar Khan,\r\nSayyid Adam Barha, Shaikh Achhay, [352] nephew of Muqarrab Khan,\r\nMu`tamad Khan, the sons of Mu`azzam Khan Ihtimam Khan, and others. He\r\ntook with him also some of his own men. At the hour when Mushtari\r\n(Jupiter) was propitious, he started off this band, and appointed Mir\r\nQasim, son of Mirza Murad, its chief paymaster and news-writer. He took\r\nalso some of the Zamindars with him to show the road. The victorious\r\narmies started. When they reached the neighbourhood of `Usman's fort\r\nand land, they sent some eloquent men to admonish him and point out to\r\nhim the way of loyalty, and bring him back from the road of rebellion\r\nto the right path. As much pride had seated itself in his brain-cup,\r\nand he had in his head a desire to seize the country, beside other\r\nfancies, he turned a deaf ear to their words and prepared himself for\r\nconflict and fight. The battlefield happened to be on the bank of a\r\nnullah in a place which was a complete bog. On Sunday (12th March,\r\n1612), the 9th Muharram, Shaja`at Khan, choosing the hour for the\r\nfight, arrayed the victorious forces, so that everyone should go to\r\nhis place and be prepared for the battle. `Usman had not settled the\r\nbattle for that day with himself. When he heard that the royal army\r\nhad come prepared for battle, having no remedy he himself mounted and\r\ncame to the bank of the nullah, and arrayed his own horse and foot\r\nopposite the victorious army. When the affair grew hot, and the two\r\nforces opposed each other, that foolish, obstinate man at the first\r\nonset threw his own fighting raging elephant against the advanced\r\nguard. After much fighting many of the leaders of the advanced guard,\r\nas Sayyid Adam [353] Barha and Shaikh Achhay, attained the dignity\r\nof martyrdom. Iftikhar Khan, the leader of the right wing, was in\r\nno way remiss in attacking, and sacrificed his own life. The band\r\nthat was with him fought to such a degree that they were all cut to\r\npieces. In the same way Kishwar [354] Khan and his band of the left\r\nwing bravely sacrificed themselves in the affair of their master,\r\nbut many of the enemy (lit. those of dark fortune) were also wounded\r\nand killed. That evil one (`Usman) took account of the combatants\r\nand ascertained that the leaders of the advanced guard and right and\r\nleft wings were killed. The centre alone remained. He took no account\r\nof the killed and wounded on his own side, but attacked the centre\r\n(of the royal army) with the same energy. On this side the son and\r\nbrothers and sons-in-law of Shaja`at Khan, as well as other officers,\r\nstopped the advance of those lost ones, and attacked them like tigers\r\nand leopards armed with claws and teeth. Some of them attained the\r\ndignity of martyrdom, and those that remained alive bore away fatal\r\nwounds. At this time (`Usman) drove a raging elephant of the name\r\nof Gajpat, [355] which was his premier elephant, at Shaja`at Khan,\r\nwho laid hold of his spear and struck the elephant. What does a\r\nraging elephant care for a javelin. He then seized his sword and\r\nstruck him two blows one after another. How did he regard these\r\neither! He then drew his dagger and struck him twice with it, but\r\nfor this, too, he did not turn back, but overthrew Shaja`at Khan with\r\nhis horse. Immediately he was separated from his horse; calling out\r\n\"Jahangir Shah,\" he leapt up, and his equerry struck the elephant on\r\nboth front legs a blow with a two-handed sword. As the elephant fell\r\non his knees, the equerry pulled the elephant driver down off the\r\nelephant, and Shaja`at with the dagger he had in his hand, and while\r\non foot, struck such blows on the trunk and forehead of the elephant\r\nthat the elephant roared out at the pain and turned round. As he was\r\nseverely wounded, he went to his own army and fell down. Shaja`at\r\nKhan's horse got up safely. As he was mounting his horse those vile\r\nones drove another elephant at his standard-bearer, and overthrew his\r\nhorse and standard. Shaja`at Khan gave a manly shout and roused the\r\nstandard-bearer, saying: \"Be bold: I'm alive and the standard is at\r\nmy feet (?).\" [356] At this critical moment all the servants of the\r\nState who were present seized their arrows and daggers and swords,\r\nand smote the elephant. Shaja`at himself came up and shouted to the\r\nstandard-bearer to rise, and got another horse for the standard-bearer\r\nand mounted him on it. The standard-bearer unfurled the standard and\r\nmaintained his ground. At the time of this struggle a (ball from a)\r\ngun struck that rebel on his forehead. However much they enquired\r\nfor the man who fired it he could not be found. When this struck\r\nhim, he recognized that he was a dead man. Yet for two watches,\r\nnotwithstanding this fatal wound, he urged on his men to the fight,\r\nand the battlefield was still deadly and the struggle warm. Afterwards\r\nthe enemy turned their faces, and the victorious army pursued them,\r\nand continually striking them drove back those vile ones into the place\r\nwhere they had encamped. With arrows and guns those wretches would\r\nnot allow the royal troops to enter the place where they were. When\r\nWali, the brother of `Usman, and Mamrez, his (`Usman's) son and other\r\nrelations and followers became aware of `Usman's wound, they made\r\nup their minds that he would not recover from it, and that if they,\r\ndefeated and put to flight, should go towards their fort none would\r\nreach it alive. They thought it best to remain for the night in the\r\nplace where they had encamped, and towards the end of the night seek\r\nan opportunity and get to their fort. Two watches of night had passed\r\nwhen `Usman went to hell. In the third watch they raised his lifeless\r\nbody, and leaving his tent and the things they had with them in the\r\ncamp, proceeded to their fortress. The scouts of the victorious army,\r\nhaving obtained news of this, informed Shaja`at Khan. On the morning\r\nof Monday the loyalists assembled and decided to follow them, and\r\nnot allow breathing-time to those of dark fortune. In the end, in\r\nconsequence of the tired state of the soldiers, and in order to bury\r\nthe martyrs and out of sympathy for the wounded, they were perplexed\r\nin their minds as to going or settling down (where they were). Just\r\nat this time `Abdu-s-Salam, son of Mu`azzam Khan, arrived with a body\r\nof servants of the State, altogether 300 horse and 400 musketeers\r\n(tupchi). When this fresh body of men arrived it was determined to\r\npursue, and they accordingly went on. When Wali, who after `Usman\r\nwas the stock of the disturbance, learned that Shaja`at Khan with the\r\nvictorious army had come together with another fresh force, he saw no\r\nresource for himself but to go to Shaja`at Khan on the straight line\r\nof faith and loyalty. In the end he sent a message that he who had\r\nbeen the cause of the disturbance had gone, and that the body of those\r\nwho were left were servants and Musulmans. If he would give his word\r\nthey would wait upon him and would agree to serve the State, giving\r\ntheir elephants as an offering. Shaja`at Khan and Mu`taqid Khan, who\r\nhad arrived on the day of the battle and had done approved service,\r\nand all those who were loyal, in accordance with the necessity of\r\nthe time and with what was best for the State, gave their word and\r\nencouraged them. On the next day, Wali and the sons, brothers, and\r\nsons-in-law of `Usman all came and waited upon Shaja`at Khan and the\r\nother servants of the State. They brought forty-nine elephants as an\r\noffering. After the completion of this work Shaja`at Khan, leaving\r\nsome of the royal servants in Adhar [357] and the neighbourhood which\r\nwas in the possession of that one of evil fortune, took with him\r\nWali and the other Afghans, and on Monday, the 6th of the month of\r\nSafar, came to Jahangirnagar (Dacca) and joined Islam Khan. When the\r\njoyful news reached in Agra this supplicant at the throne of Allah,\r\nhe performed the prostrations of gratitude, and recognized that the\r\ndriving away of this description of enemy was brought about simply\r\nthrough the unstinted mercy of the Almighty Giver. As a reward for\r\nthis good service I promoted Islam Khan to the rank of 6,000 personal,\r\nand honoured Shaja`at Khan with the title of \"Rustam of the age\"\r\n(Rustam-zaman), as well as increased his rank by 1,000 personal and\r\nhorse. I also increased the rank of other servants according to the\r\nmeasure of their services, and they were selected for other honours.\r\n\r\nWhen this news first came of the killing of `Usman it appeared to\r\nbe a joke, but by way of ascertaining the truth or falsehood of the\r\nwords I took an omen from the divan of the tongue of the unseen world,\r\nKhwaja Hafiz of Shiraz, and this ghazal [358] turned up:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"I make my eyes red and throw patience to the wilds,\r\n    And in such a case throw my heart into the sea.\r\n    I'm wounded by the shaft of heaven:\r\n    Give wine, so that intoxicated I may cast a knot in the girdle\r\n                                                        of the Twins.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAs this couplet was very appropriate to the occasion, I drew an omen\r\nfrom it. After some days news came again that the arrow of Fate,\r\nor rather of God, had struck `Usman, for however much they enquired\r\nfor him, he who fired the shot was not made manifest. This has been\r\nrecorded on account of its strange nature.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th Farwardin, Muqarrab Khan, who is one of my chief retainers\r\nand the old confidants of the Jahangiri service, who had attained\r\nthe rank of 3,000 personal and 2,000 horse, came from the fort\r\nof Cambay and had the honour of waiting on me. I had ordered him,\r\non account of certain business, to go to the port of Goa [359] and\r\nbuy for the private use of the government certain rareties procurable\r\nthere. According to orders he went with diligence to Goa, and remaining\r\nthere for some time, took at the price the Franks asked for them the\r\nrareties he met with at that port, without looking at the face of\r\nthe money at all (i.e. regardless of cost). When he returned from\r\nthe aforesaid port to the Court, he produced before me one by one\r\nthe things and rareties he had brought. Among these were some animals\r\nthat were very strange and wonderful, such as I had never seen, and\r\nup to this time no one had known their names. Although King Babar has\r\ndescribed in his Memoirs the appearance and shapes of several animals,\r\nhe had never ordered the painters to make pictures of them. As these\r\nanimals appeared to me to be very strange, I both described them and\r\nordered that painters should draw them in the Jahangir-nama, so that\r\nthe amazement that arose from hearing of them might be increased. One\r\nof these animals in body is larger than a peahen and smaller than a\r\npeacock. [360] When it is in heat and displays itself, it spreads out\r\nits feathers like the peacock and dances about. Its beak and legs are\r\nlike those of a cock. Its head and neck and the part under the throat\r\nare every minute of a different colour. When it is in heat it is quite\r\nred--one might say it had adorned itself with red coral--and after a\r\nwhile it becomes white in the same places, and looks like cotton. It\r\nsometimes looks of a turquoise colour. Like a chameleon it constantly\r\nchanges colour. Two pieces of flesh it has on its head look like the\r\ncomb of a cock. A strange thing is this, that when it is in heat the\r\naforesaid piece of flesh hangs down to the length of a span from the\r\ntop of its head like an elephant's trunk, and again when he raises it\r\nup it appears on its head like the horn of a rhinoceros, to the extent\r\nof two finger-breadths. Round its eyes it is always of a turquoise\r\ncolour, and does not change. Its feathers appear to be of various\r\ncolours, differing from the colours of the peacock's feathers. He\r\nalso brought a monkey of a strange and wonderful form. Its hands,\r\nfeet, ears, and head are like those of a monkey, and its face like\r\nthat of a fox. The colour of its eyes is like that of a hawk's eye,\r\nbut the eyes are larger than those of a hawk. From its head to the\r\nend of its tail it is an ordinary cubit in length. It is lower than\r\na monkey and taller than a fox. Its hair is like the wool of a sheep\r\nand its colour like that of ashes. From the lobe of its ear to its\r\nchin it is red and of the colour of wine. Its tail is two or three\r\nfinger-breadths longer than half a cubit, quite different from that\r\nof other monkeys. The tail of this animal hangs down like the tail\r\nof a cat. Sometimes it makes a sound like a young antelope. On the\r\nwhole it is a very strange beast. Of the wild birds which they call\r\ntadru (pheasant) till now it has never been heard that they breed in\r\ncaptivity. In the time of my revered father they made great efforts\r\nto obtain eggs and young ones but it was not managed. I ordered them\r\nto keep some of them, male and female, in one place, and by degrees\r\nthey bred. I ordered them to place the eggs under hens, and in a\r\nspace of two years sixty or seventy young were produced and fifty or\r\nsixty grew up. Whoever heard of this matter was astonished. It was\r\nsaid that in the Wilayat (Persia?) the people there had made great\r\nefforts, but no eggs were produced and no young were obtained.\r\n\r\nIn these days I increased the mansab of Mahabat Khan by 1,000 personal\r\nand 500 horse, which thus became 4,000 personal and 3,500 horse. The\r\nmansab of I`timadu-d-daulah, original and increased, was fixed at\r\n4,000 personal and 1,000 horse. To the mansab of Maha Singh also an\r\nincrease of 500 personal and horse was given: it was originally and\r\nwith increase 3,000 personal and 2,000 horse. The mansab of I`tiqad\r\nKhan was increased by 500 personal and 200 horse, and made up to 1,000\r\npersonal and 300 horse. Khwaja Abu-l-hasan in these days came from the\r\nDeccan and waited on me. Daulat Khan, who had been appointed to the\r\nfaujdarship of Allahabad and of the Sarkar of Jaunpur, came and paid\r\nhis respects: an increase of 500 was made to his mansab, which was\r\n1,000. On the day of culmination (ruz-i-sharaf), which was the 19th\r\nFarwardin, I raised the mansab of Sultan Khurram, which was 10,000,\r\nto 12,000, and made that of I`tibar Khan, which was 3,000 personal\r\nand 1,000 horse, up to 4,000. I raised the mansab of Muqarrab Khan\r\nfrom 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse by 500 personal and horse; and\r\nincreased that of Khwaja Jahan, which was 2,000 personal and 1,200\r\nhorse, by 500. As these were the days of the New Year, many of the\r\nservants (of the State) obtained an increase of their mansabs. On\r\nthe same day Dulip came from the Deccan and waited on me. As his\r\nfather Ray Ray Singh had died, I honoured him with the title of Ray\r\nand clothed him in a dress of honour. Ray Ray Singh had another son,\r\nby name Suraj Singh. Although Dulip was his tika (marked with the\r\ntika) son, he wished Suraj Singh to succeed him, in consequence of\r\nthe love that he bore to his mother. When the circumstances of his\r\ndeath were reported to me, Suraj Singh, in consequence of his want\r\nof intelligence and tender years, represented to me: \"My father\r\nhas made me his successor and given me the tika.\" This remark was\r\nnot to my liking, and I said: \"If thy father has given the tika to\r\nthee, we shall give it to Dulip.\" Then marking the tika with my own\r\nhand, I presented the latter with his father's jagir and hereditary\r\npossessions. I bestowed on I`timadu-d-daulah an inkstand and jewelled\r\npen. Rudar, the father of Lakhmi Chand, Raja of Kumaon, who is one\r\nof the considerable Rajas of the hill country, had come in the time\r\nof the late King Akbar, [361] and when he came had petitioned [362]\r\nthat the son of Raja Todar Mal might take him by the hand and bring\r\nhim to wait on him. In consequence, the Raja's (Todar Mal's) son had\r\nbeen appointed to bring him. Lakhmi Chand now similarly asked that\r\nthe son of I`timadu-d-daulah might bring him to pay his respects. I\r\nsent Shapur [363] to bring him to wait on me. He laid before me rare\r\nthings from his own hill country, such as gunth ponies, and birds of\r\nprey, such as hawks, jurra (falcons), royal falcons, qatas (yaks),\r\nnavels of musk, and skins of the musk antelope with the musk-bags on\r\nthem, swords which in their language they call khanda, and daggers\r\nwhich they call katar, and all kinds of things. Amongst the Rajas of\r\nthis hill country this Raja is well known for the large quantities\r\nof gold he has. They say there is a gold-mine in his territory. [364]\r\n\r\nIn order to lay the foundation of a palace at Lahore, I sent there\r\nKhwaja Jahan Khwaja Dust Muhammad, who is well skilled in this kind\r\nof business.\r\n\r\nAs the affairs of the Deccan, in consequence of the disagreements\r\namong the Sardars and the carelessness of Khan A`zam, did not look\r\nwell, and the defeat of `Abdu-llah Khan had taken place, I had sent\r\nfor Khwaja Abu-l-hasan to make enquiries into the real state of these\r\nquarrels. After much enquiry and investigation it became clear that\r\nthe defeat of `Abdu-llah Khan had been caused by his pride and his\r\nsharp temper, and not listening to words (of advice) and partly by\r\nthe quarrels and want of agreement between the Amirs. Briefly, it had\r\nbeen determined that `Abdu-llah Khan should start from the direction\r\nof Nasik and Trimbak with the Gujarat army and the Amirs who had been\r\nappointed to accompany him. This army had been brought into proper\r\norder by trustworthy leaders and zealous Amirs, such as Raja Ram Das,\r\nKhan A`lam, Saif Khan, `Ali Mardan Bahadur, Zafar Khan, and other\r\nservants of the State. The number of the army had passed 10,000 and\r\ncome up to near 14,000. On the side of Berar it was settled that Raja\r\nMan Singh, Khan Jahan, the Amiru-l-umara, and many other leaders should\r\nproceed. These two armies should be aware of each other's marches and\r\nhalts, so that on an appointed day they might catch the enemy between\r\nthe two. If this rule had been observed and their hearts had been in\r\nunison, and self-interest had not come between, it is most probable\r\nthat Almighty God would have given them the victory of the day. When\r\n`Abdu-llah Khan passed the Ghats and entered the enemy's country,\r\nhe did not take care to send runners (qasidan) to bring intelligence\r\nfrom the other army, nor did he, in accordance with the arrangements,\r\nmake his movements harmonise with theirs, so that on an appointed day\r\nthey might take the enemy between two armies. Rather he relied on\r\nhis own strength, and considered that if he could gain the victory\r\nalone it would be better. This idea fixed itself in his mind, and\r\nhowever much Ram Das desired him to promise to go forward with due\r\ndeliberation, it was of no use. The enemy, who were observing him\r\nclosely, had sent a large number of leaders and Bargis (Mahrattas)\r\nagainst him, and encounters took place with them every day. They did\r\nnot fail to throw rockets and different fireworks at night. At last\r\nthe enemy drew near, and yet he obtained no intelligence about the\r\nother army, though he had approached Daulatabad, which was the place\r\nof assembly of the Dakhanis. `Ambar, the black-faced, had raised to\r\nsovereignty a child who, in his opinion, bore relationship to the\r\nfamily of Nizamu-l-mulk. In order that men might fully accept his\r\n(the child's) sovereignty, he raised him up and took him by the hand,\r\nand made himself the Peshwa and leader. He sent men again and again\r\n(against `Abdu-llah), and the number of the enemy was continually\r\nincreasing till at last they made an attack, and by throwing rockets\r\nand other fireworks made matters hot for him. [365] At length the\r\nloyalists thought it best, as no assistance had come to them from the\r\nother army and all the Dakhanis had turned against them, to retreat at\r\nonce and try some other arrangement. All agreed, and with one consent\r\nstarted off before dawn. The Dakhanis followed them to the boundaries\r\nof their own country, and the two armies, meeting every day, did not\r\nfail in fighting. In these days several of the ambitious and zealous\r\nyoung men were killed. `Ali Mardan Khan Bahadur, behaving like a brave\r\nman, carried away terrible wounds and fell into the hands of the enemy,\r\nand showed his companions an example of fidelity to his salt and of\r\nlife-sacrifice. Zu-l-faqar Beg also displayed manly actions, and a\r\nrocket struck him on the leg, and two days afterwards he died. When\r\nthey entered the country of Raja Bharju, [366] who was one of those\r\nloyal to the throne, that body (the enemy) turned back, and `Abdu-llah\r\nKhan proceeded towards Gujarat. The real truth is this, that if in\r\ngoing he had drawn his rein (gone slowly) and allowed the other army\r\nto have come up to him, the matter would have turned out according to\r\nthe wish of the chief men of the victorious State. [367] As soon as the\r\nnews of the retreat of `Abdu-llah Khan reached the leaders of the army\r\nthat was advancing from Berar, not seeing any advantage from further\r\nstay, they also retired, and joined the camp of Parwiz at `Adilabad\r\nin the neighbourhood of Burhanpur. When this intelligence reached me\r\nat Agra I was greatly agitated, and proposed to go there myself and\r\ndestroy root and branch those servants who had become masters. The\r\nAmirs and other devoted ones would in no way consent to this. Khwaja\r\nAbu-l-hasan represented that as no one understood the business of that\r\nregion as the Khankhanan did I ought to send him, and that he should\r\nagain arrange matters that had fallen into disorder, and according\r\nto the exigencies of the time should compose differences so that\r\naffairs might return to their original condition. Other well-wishers\r\nbeing consulted, all their opinions were at one in this, that the\r\nKhankhanan must be sent and that Khwaja Abu-l-hasan should accompany\r\nhim. Agreeing with this determination, those who had charge of the\r\naffairs of the Khankhanan and his companions obtained leave to go on\r\nSunday, the 17th Urdibihisht, in the 7th year. Shah-nawaz Khan, Khwaja\r\nAbu-l-hasan, Razzaq-birdi Uzbeg, and several others of his associates\r\npaid their parting salutations on the same day. The Khankhanan was\r\npromoted to the rank of 6,000 personal, Shah-nawaz Khan to that of\r\n3,000 and horse, that of Darab Khan increased by 500 personal and 300\r\nhorse (altogether 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse), and to Rahman-dad,\r\nhis (the Khankhanan's) younger son, I also gave a fitting mansab. I\r\npresented the Khankhanan with a grand dress of honour, a jewelled\r\ndagger, a special elephant with talayir (accoutrements), and an Iraq\r\nhorse. In the same way I bestowed on his sons and companions dresses\r\nof honour and horses. In the same month Mu`izzu-l-mulk came from Kabul\r\nwith his sons, and had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. Shyam\r\nSingh and Ray Mangat Bhadauriya, who belonged to the army of Bangash,\r\naccording to the request of Qilij Khan, were promoted to higher\r\nmansabs. Shyam Singh had 1,500 personal and was increased by 500,\r\nand Ray Mangat was also raised to a higher rank.\r\n\r\nFor a long time past news had come of the illness of Asaf Khan;\r\nsometimes the disease was got under and sometimes recurred, until\r\nhe died at Burhanpur in the 63rd year of his age. His understanding\r\nand capacity were very good. He was very quick-witted. He also wrote\r\npoetry. He composed \"Khusrau and Shirin,\" dedicating it to me, and\r\ncalled it the \"Nur-nama\" (the writing of light). [368] He had been\r\nennobled in the time of my revered father and made Vizier. In the\r\ndays when I was a prince he had several times done foolish things,\r\nand most men, and indeed Khusrau himself, were of opinion that after\r\nmy accession I would do unpleasant things (with regard to him). In a\r\nmanner contrary to what had entered the minds of himself and others,\r\nI favoured him and promoted him to the rank of 5,000 personal and\r\nhorse, and after he had for some time been Vizier with full authority,\r\nneglected no point in increasing favour towards him. After his death\r\nI gave mansabs to his sons and bestowed kindnesses on them. At last\r\nit was clear that his disposition and sincerity were not as they\r\nshould be, and, considering his own evil deeds, he had always been\r\nsuspicious with regard to me. They say he was aware of the conspiracy\r\nand disturbance that took place on the Kabul expedition, and had\r\ngiven support to the wretches. Indeed, I had no confidence that\r\nnotwithstanding my favour and kindness to him he was not disloyal\r\nand of perverse fortune.\r\n\r\nAfter a short space of time, on the 25th of the same month of\r\nUrdibihisht, the news of Mirza Ghazi's death arrived. The said\r\nMirza was of the ruling family of Thatta (Tatta), of the tribe of\r\nTarkhani. His father, Mirza Jani, in the time of my revered father\r\nbecame loyal, and with the Khankhanan, who had been appointed to his\r\nprovince, he had the good fortune to have the honour of waiting on\r\nAkbar near Lahore. By the royal favour he was given his own province,\r\nand, choosing himself to serve at Court, he sent his men to the charge\r\nand administration of Thatta, and remained in the service while\r\nhe lived. At last he died at Burhanpur. Mirza Ghazi Khan, his son,\r\nwho was at Thatta, in accordance with the firman of the late king\r\nobtained the government of that country. Sa`id Khan, who was at Bhakar\r\n(Bukkur), received an order to console him and bring him to Court. The\r\naforesaid Khan sent men to him to recommend loyalty to him. At last,\r\nhaving brought him to Agra, he procured him the honour of kissing\r\nthe feet of my revered father. He was at Agra when my father died\r\nand I ascended the throne. After I arrived at Lahore for the pursuit\r\nof Khusrau news came that the Amirs on the borders of Khurasan had\r\nassembled together and proceeded against Qandahar, and that Shah Beg,\r\nthe governor of that place, was shut up in the fort and looking out\r\nfor assistance. Of necessity an army was appointed for the relief\r\nof Qandahar under the leadership of Mirza Ghazi and other Amirs\r\nand generals. When this army reached the neighbourhood of Qandahar,\r\nthe army of Khurasan, not seeing in themselves the power to await it,\r\nreturned. Mirza Ghazi, having entered Qandahar, handed over the country\r\nand the fort to Sardar Khan, who had been appointed to the government\r\nof the place, and Shah Beg went to his own jagir. Mirza Ghazi started\r\nfor Lahore by way of Bhakar. Sardar Khan was only a short time at\r\nQandahar before he died, and that province was again in need of a\r\nleader and master. This time I added Qandahar to Thatta and handed\r\nit over to Mirza Ghazi. From that time till his death he remained\r\nthere continuously in performance of the duties of its protection\r\nand government. His conduct towards the disaffected was excellent. As\r\nit was necessary to send a leader to Qandahar in the place of Mirza\r\nGhazi, I appointed Abu-l-bi Uzbeg, [369] who was at Multan and in\r\nthat neighbourhood, to that post. I promoted him in rank from 1,500\r\npersonal and 1,000 horse to 3,000 personal and horse, and honoured him\r\nwith the title of Bahad Khan and a standard. The governorship of Delhi\r\nand the protection and administration of that province was conferred\r\non Muqarrab Khan. I dignified Rup Khawass, who was one of the personal\r\nservants of my revered father, with the title of Khawass Khan, and,\r\ngiving him the rank of 1,000 personal and 500 horse, bestowed on him\r\nthe faujdarship of the Sarkar of Qanuj. As I had sought the daughter\r\n[370] of I`tiqad Khan, son of I`timadu-d-daulah, in marriage for\r\nKhurram, and the marriage festival had been arranged for, I went on\r\nThursday, 18th Khurdad, to his house, and stayed there one day and\r\none night. He (Khurram) presented offerings (to me) and he gave jewels\r\n[371] to the Begams, and to his mothers (including stepmothers) and to\r\nthe female servants of the harem, and dresses of honour to the Amirs.\r\n\r\nI sent `Abdu-r-Razzaq, the bakhshi of the palace (darkhana), to settle\r\nthe country of Thatta (Sind) until a Sardar should be appointed who\r\ncould conciliate the soldiery and the cultivators, and so bring\r\nthe province into order. I increased his rank and presented him\r\nwith an elephant and a shawl (parmnarm), and sent him off. I made\r\nMu`izzu-l-mulk bakhshi in his room. Khwaja Jahan, who had been sent\r\nto inspect the buildings in Lahore and to arrange about them, came\r\nin the end of this month and waited on me. Mirza `Isa Tarkhan, one\r\nof the relations of Mirza Ghazi, had been appointed to the army of\r\nthe Deccan. I sent for him to arrange about the business of Thatta,\r\nand on the same day he had the good fortune to pay his respects. As he\r\nwas deserving of favour, he was given the rank of 1,000 personal and\r\n500 horse. The disease of khun-para [372] had affected my health. By\r\nthe advice of the physicians on Wednesday, the (date not given) of\r\nthe said month, I drew about a sir (asar) [373] of blood from my left\r\narm. As great lightness resulted, it occurred to me that if they were\r\nto call blood-letting 'lightening' it would be well. Nowadays this\r\nexpression is made use of. To Muqarrab Khan, who had bled me, I gave\r\na jewelled khapwa (dagger). Kishan Das, accountant of the elephant\r\ndepartment and stable, who from the time of the late king until now\r\nhas been the clerk in charge of two departments, and for ages had\r\nbeen hopeful of the title of Raja and the rank of 1,000 personal,\r\nand before this had been gratified with a title, now had the rank\r\nof 1,000 conferred on him. Mirza Rustam, son of Sultan Husain Mirza\r\nSafawi, who had been appointed to the army of the Deccan, I sent for\r\nat his request. On Saturday, the 9th of the month of Tir, he came with\r\nhis sons and waited on me. He made an offering of a ruby and forty-six\r\nroyal pearls. I increased the rank of Taj Khan, the governor of Bhakar,\r\nwho was one of the old Amirs of this State, by 500 personal and horse.\r\n\r\nThe tale of the death of Shaja`at Khan is a very strange affair. After\r\nhe had performed such services and Islam Khan had given him leave\r\nto go to the Sarkar of Orissa, one night on the road he was riding\r\non a female elephant chaukandi-dar [374] (? in a square howdah or\r\nfour-pillared canopy), and had given a young eunuch a place behind\r\nhim. When he left his camp they had fastened up an elephant that\r\nwas in heat on the road. From the noise of the horses' hoofs and\r\nthe movement of the horsemen he attempted to break his chain. On this\r\naccount a great noise and confusion took place. When this noise reached\r\nthe ear of the eunuch, he in a state of bewilderment awoke Shaja`at\r\nKhan, who was asleep or in the insensibility of wine, and said: \"An\r\nelephant in heat has got loose and is coming in this direction.\" As\r\nsoon as he heard this he became confused and threw himself down from\r\nthe front of the chaukandi. When he threw himself off his toe struck\r\nagainst a stone and was torn open, and he died in two or three days of\r\nthat same wound. In short, from hearing this affair I was completely\r\nbewildered. That a brave man on the mere hearing of a cry or a word\r\ncoming from a child should become so confused and throw himself down\r\nwithout control from the top of an elephant is in truth a matter of\r\namazement. The news of this event reached me on the 19th of the month\r\nof Tir. I consoled his sons with kindnesses and the conferring of\r\noffices. If this accident had not happened to him, as he had done\r\nnotable service, he would have obtained exaltation with greater\r\nfavours and kindnesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n            \"One cannot strive against destiny.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIslam Khan had sent 160 male and female elephants from Bengal; they\r\nwere brought before me and placed in my private elephant stables. Raja\r\nTekchand, the Raja of Kumaon, asked for leave to depart. As in the\r\ntime of my father there had been given to his father 100 horses, I\r\ngave him the same number as well as an elephant, and while he was at\r\nCourt bestowed on him dresses of honour and a jewelled dagger. Also\r\nto his brothers I gave dresses of honour and horses. I presented him\r\nwith his territory according to previous arrangements, and he went\r\nback to his home happy and successful.\r\n\r\nIt happened incidentally that this verse of the Amiru-l-umara was\r\nquoted:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Pass, O Messiah, o'er the heads of us slain by love;\r\n    Thy restoring one life is worth a hundred murders.\" [375]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I have a poetical disposition I sometimes intentionally and\r\nsometimes involuntarily compose couplets and quatrains. So the\r\nfollowing couplet came into my head:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Turn not thy cheek, without thee I cannot live a moment;\r\n    For thee to break one heart is equal a hundred murders.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I had recited this, everyone who had a poetical vein composed a\r\ncouplet in the same mode. Mulla `Ali Ahmad, [376] the seal-engraver,\r\nof whom an account has been given previously, had not said badly--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"O Censor, fear the weeping of the old vintner;\r\n    Thy breaking one jar is equal to a hundred murders.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAbu-l-fath Dakhani, [377] who was one of the most considerable of `Adil\r\nKhan's Amirs, and had two years previously taken to being loyal and had\r\nentered himself among the leaders of the victorious army, on the 10th\r\nof Amurdad waited on me, and being accepted by my grace and favour\r\nhad bestowed on him a special sword and a robe of honour, and after\r\nsome days I also gave him a special horse. Khwajagi Muhammad Husain,\r\n[378] who had gone to Kashmir as the deputy for his brother's son,\r\nwhen he was satisfied in his mind with the state of affairs of that\r\nplace, came on the same day and waited on me. As a Sardar was needed\r\nto be sent for the governorship of Patna and the rule of that place,\r\nit occurred to me to send Mirza Rustam. Having raised his rank from\r\n5,000 personal and 1,500 horse to 5,000 personal and horse, on the\r\n26th Jumada-s-sani, corresponding to the 2nd Shahriwar, I gave him the\r\ngovernment of Patna, and bestowing on him a special elephant, a horse\r\nwith a jewelled saddle, a jewelled sword, and a superb dress of honour,\r\nI dismissed him. His sons and the sons of his brother Muzaffar Husain\r\nKhan Mirza'i were exalted with increased rank, elephants, horses,\r\nand dresses of honour, and sent off with him. I appointed Ray Dulip\r\nto support Mirza Rustam. As his residence was near that place, he\r\ncollected a good body of men for that service. I increased his rank\r\nby 500 personal and horse, so that it became 2,000 with 1,000 horse,\r\nand also gave him an elephant. Abu-l-fath Dakhani had obtained a jagir\r\nin the Sarkar of Nagpur and that neighbourhood. He was dismissed in\r\norder that he might administer his jagir and look to the guarding and\r\ngovernment of that country as well. Khusrau Bi Uzbeg was appointed\r\nto the faujdarship of the Sarkar of Mewar. His rank of 800 personal\r\nand 300 horse was now increased to 1,000 personal and 500 horse, and I\r\nalso presented him with a horse. As I had my eye on the old service of\r\nMuqarrab Khan, it occurred to me that I must not pass by the desire of\r\nhis heart. I had increased his rank and he had obtained good jagirs,\r\nbut he longed for a standard and drums, and he was now honoured with\r\nthese as well. Salih, the adopted son of Khwaja Beg-Mirza Safawi,\r\nwas a youth of great bravery and zeal. I gave him the title of Khanjar\r\nKhan, and made him eager in the service.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the 22nd Shahriwar, corresponding with 17th Rajab,\r\n1021, the feast of my solar weighing took place in the house of\r\nMaryam-zamani. It is an approved custom with me to weigh myself in\r\nthis manner. The late king Akbar, who was the place of manifestation\r\nof kindness and grace, also approved of the custom, and twice in every\r\nyear weighed himself against several sorts of metals, gold, silver,\r\nand many precious articles, once according to the solar and once\r\naccording to the lunar year, and divided their total value, which\r\nwas worth about a lakh of rupees, among faqirs and needy people. I\r\nalso observe this annual custom and weigh myself in the same manner,\r\nand give those valuables to faqirs. Mu`taqid Khan, Diwan of Bengal,\r\nwho had been relieved from that service, produced before me the sons\r\nand brothers and some of the servants of `Usman, whom Islam Khan had\r\nsent with him to the Court. The charge of each one of the Afghans was\r\nentrusted to a responsible servant. Then he (Mu`taqid) produced his\r\nown offering, which consisted of twenty-five elephants, two rubies,\r\na jewelled phul katara [379] (a kind of dagger), trustworthy eunuchs,\r\nBengal stuffs, etc. Mir Miran, son of Sultan Khwaja, who was in the\r\nDeccan army, obtained the honour of kissing the threshold and gave\r\na ruby as an offering. As between Qilij Khan, leader of the army\r\nof Bangash on the borders of Kabul, and the Amirs of that Subah who\r\nhad been sent as companions to him under his leadership, there were\r\nquarrels, especially with Khan Dauran, I sent Khwaja Jahan to make\r\nenquiry as to which side was in fault. On the 11th of the month of\r\nMihr, Mu`taqid Khan was appointed to the high dignity of bakhshi,\r\nand his mansab was raised to 1,000 personal and 300 horse. Raising for\r\nthe second time the mansabs of Muqarrab Khan a little, I made it 2,500\r\npersonal and 1,500 horse by an increase of 500. On the representation\r\nof the Khankhanan, Faridun Khan Barlas was raised to the mansab,\r\noriginal and increase, of 2,500 personal and 2,000 horse. Ray Manohar\r\nreceived that of 1,000 personal and 800 horse, and Raja Bir Singh Deo\r\nthat of 4,000 personal and 2,200 horse. Bharat, grandson of Ramchand\r\nBandilah, I, after the latter's death, honoured with the title of\r\nRaja. On the 28th Aban, Zafar Khan, having come according to summons\r\nfrom the Subah of Gujarat, waited on me. He brought as offerings a ruby\r\nand three pearls. On the 6th Azar, corresponding with the 3rd Shawwal,\r\nnews came from Burhanpur that the Amiru-l-umara had died on Sunday,\r\nthe 27th Aban, in the parganah of Nihalpur. After the illness he had\r\nat Lahore his intelligence appeared to be less, and a great loss of\r\nmemory happened to him. He was very sincere. It is sad that he left\r\nno son capable of patronage and favour. Chin Qilij Khan came from\r\nhis father, who was at Peshawar, on the 20th Azar, and offered (on\r\nhis father's behalf) 100 muhrs and 100 rupees, and also presented the\r\nofferings he had of his own in the shape of a horse and cloth stuffs\r\nand other things. To the government of Behar I promoted Zafar Khan,\r\nwho is one of the trustworthy house-born ones and foster-children,\r\nand increasing his mansab by 500 personal and horse, I made it up to\r\n3,000 personal and 2,000 horse, and also honouring his brothers with\r\nrobes of honour and horses, allowed them to go off to that province. He\r\nhad always hoped that he might obtain some separate service in order\r\nthat he might show his natural ability. I also desired to prove him\r\nand make this service the touchstone by which to try him. As it was\r\nthe season for travelling and hunting, on Tuesday, the 2nd Zi-l-qa`da\r\n(25th December, 1612), corresponding with the 4th Day, I left Agra\r\nwith the intention of hunting and encamped in the Dahrah garden,\r\nremaining there four days. [380] On the 10th of the same month the\r\nnews came of the death of Salima Sultan Begam, who had been ill in\r\nthe city. Her mother was Gul-rukh Begam, daughter of King Babar, and\r\nher father Mirza Nuru-d-din Muhammad, of the Naqshbandi Khwajas. She\r\nwas adorned with all good qualities. In women this degree of skill\r\nand capacity is seldom found. H.M. Humayun, by way of kindness (to\r\nBairam), had betrothed her who was his sister's daughter to Bairam\r\nKhan. After his death, in the beginning of the reign of the late king\r\nAkbar, the marriage took place. After the said Khan had been killed,\r\nmy revered father married her himself. She received mercy (died)\r\nin the 60th year of her age. [381] On the same day I marched from\r\nthe Dahrah garden and sent I`timadu-d-daulah to bury her (lit. lift\r\nher up), and ordered him to place her in the building in the Mandakar\r\ngarden which she herself had made. On the 17th of the month of Day,\r\nMirza `Ali Beg Akbarshahi came from the army of the Deccan and waited\r\non me. Khwaja Jahan, whom I had despatched to the Subah of Kabul,\r\nreturned on the 21st of the same month and waited on me. The time for\r\nhis going and coming had extended to three months and eleven days. He\r\nbrought twelve muhrs and twelve rupees as an offering. On the same\r\nday Raja Ram Das also came from the victorious army of the Deccan and\r\npaid his respects, and made an offering of 101 muhrs. As robes of\r\nhonour for the winter season had not been sent to the Amirs of the\r\nDeccan, they were forwarded by the hand of Hayat Khan. As the port\r\nof Surat had been assigned in jagir to Qilij Khan, he prayed that\r\nChin Qilij (his son) might be despatched for its guardianship and\r\nadministration. On the 27th Day he had a dress of honour, and being\r\nhonoured with a dress of honour and the title of Khan, and a standard,\r\nobtained leave to go. For the purpose of advising the Amirs of Kabul,\r\nand on account of the disagreements that had sprung up between them\r\nand Qilij Khan, I sent Raja Ram Das, and bestowed on him a horse and\r\nrobe of honour and 30,000 rupees for expenses. On the 6th Bahman,\r\nwhen my camp was in the parganah of Bari, there came the news of the\r\ndeath of Khwajagi Muhammad Husain, who was of the ancient servants\r\nof this State. His elder brother, Muhammad Qasim Khan, in the time of\r\nmy revered father, found great favour, and Khwaja Muhammad Husain as\r\nwell was one of his confidential servants, and held employments such\r\nas that of superintendent of the kitchen (bakawul) and such like. He\r\nleft no son and was beardless, and not a single hair of moustache\r\nor whiskers appeared on him. At the time of speaking he spoke very\r\nshrilly, and was looked upon as an eunuch. Shah-nawaz Khan, whom the\r\nKhankhanan had sent from Burhanpur to make certain representations,\r\ncame on the 15th of the same month and waited on me. He presented 100\r\nmuhrs and 100 rupees. As the affairs of the Deccan, in consequence\r\nof the hasty proceedings of `Abdu-llah Khan and the treachery of\r\nthe Amirs, did not present a good prospect, the Dakhanis obtained\r\nan opportunity for speaking and began to talk of peace to the Amirs\r\nand well-wishers there. `Adil Khan embraced the robe of loyalty, and\r\nprayed that if the affairs of the Deccan were entrusted to him he would\r\nso arrange that some of the districts which had been taken out of the\r\npossession of the officers of the State should be restored. The loyal\r\nones, looking to the necessities of the time, represented this, and a\r\nsettlement of some kind was arrived at, and the Khankhanan undertook\r\nto settle matters. The Khan A`zam was also desirous of putting down\r\nthe rebel Rana, and begged for this service by way of obtaining merit\r\n(as a ghazi). He was ordered to go to Malwa, which was his jagir,\r\nand after arranging matters there to take up this duty. The mansab of\r\nAbu-l-bi Uzbeg [382] was increased by 1,000 personal and 500 horse\r\nto 4,000 personal and 3,500 horse. My hunting went on for 2 months\r\nand 20 days, and during that time I went out every day to hunt. As\r\nnot more than 50 or 60 days remained before the world-illumining New\r\nYear, I returned, and on the 24th Isfandiyar encamped in the Dahrah\r\ngarden. The courtiers and some of the mansabdars, who by order had\r\nremained in the city, came on that day and waited on me. Muqarrab Khan\r\npresented a decorated jar, Frank hats, and a jewelled sparrow (?). I\r\nremained three days in the garden, and on the 27th Isfandiyar entered\r\nthe city. During this time [383] 223 head of deer, etc., 95 nilgaw,\r\n2 boars, 36 cranes (or herons), etc., and 1,457 fish were killed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EIGHTH NEW YEAR AFTER THE AUSPICIOUS ACCESSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eighth year after my accession, corresponding with Muharram,\r\n1022. On the night of Thursday, the 27th Muharram, corresponding\r\nwith the 1st Farwardin in the eighth year after my accession, after\r\n3 1/2 gharis of day had elapsed, his honour the sun passed from\r\nthe constellation of Pisces to that of Aries, which is his abode of\r\nrejoicing and victory. Early in the morning of the New Year's Day\r\nthe feast was prepared and adorned after the custom of every year. At\r\nthe end of that day I sat on the throne of State, and the Amirs and\r\nministers of the State and the courtiers of the palace came to salute\r\nand congratulate me. On these days of happy augury I sat the whole\r\nday in the public audience hall. Those who had anything to ask or\r\nclaim presented their petitions, and the offerings of the servants\r\nof the palace were laid before me. Abu-l-bi, governor of Qandahar,\r\nhad sent for an offering Iraq horses and hunting dogs, and they were\r\nbrought before me. On the 9th of the same month Afzal Khan came\r\nfrom the Subah of Behar, and in waiting on me presented 100 muhrs\r\nand 100 rupees, as well as an elephant. On the 12th the offering of\r\nI`timadu-d-daulah was laid before me, consisting of jewels, cloths,\r\nand other things. That which pleased me attained to the dignity of\r\nacceptance. Of the elephants of Afzal Khan's offering ten others\r\nwere inspected on this day. On the 13th the offerings of Tarbiyat\r\nKhan were laid before me. Mu`taqid Khan bought a house at Agra, and\r\npassed some days in that place. Misfortunes happened to him one after\r\nanother. We have heard that prosperity and bad luck depend on four\r\nthings: first, upon your wife; second, upon your slave; third upon\r\nyour house; fourth, upon your horse. In order to know the prosperity\r\nor ill-luck of a house a rule has been established, indeed they say it\r\nis infallible. One must clear a small piece of the site from earth,\r\nand again strew the earth upon the same ground. If it cover it, one\r\nmay call it middling good fortune for that house, neither prosperity\r\nnor misfortune; if it become less (i.e. does not cover it exactly)\r\nit points to ill-luck, and if it does more (than cover it) it is\r\nfortunate and auspicious. On the 14th the mansab of I`tibar Khan was\r\nraised from 1,000 and 300 horse to 2,000 personal and 500 horse. I\r\nincreased the mansab of Tarbiyat Khan by 500 personal and 50 horse,\r\nso that it became 2,000 personal and 850 horse. Hushang, son of Islam\r\nKhan, who was in Bengal with his father, came at this time and paid\r\nhis respects. He brought with him some Maghs, whose country is near\r\nPegu and Arracan, and the country is still in their possession. I\r\nmade some enquiries as to their customs and religion. Briefly they\r\nare animals in the form of men. They eat everything there is either on\r\nland or in the sea, and nothing is forbidden by their religion. They\r\neat with anyone. They take into their possession (marry) their sisters\r\nby another mother. In face they are like the Qara Qalmaqs, but their\r\nlanguage is that of Tibet and quite unlike Turki. There is a range\r\nof mountains, one end of which touches the province of Kashghar and\r\nthe other the country of Pegu. They have no proper religion or any\r\ncustoms that can be interpreted as religion. They are far from the\r\nMusulman faith and separated from that of the Hindus.\r\n\r\nTwo or three days before the Sharaf (the sun's highest point) my\r\nson Khurram desired me to go to his house that he might present his\r\nNew Year's offerings from that place. I agreed to his request, and\r\nremained for one day and one night at his house. He presented his\r\nofferings. I took what I approved of and gave him back the rest. The\r\nnext day Murtaza Khan presented his offerings. Every day until the\r\nday of culmination (ruz-i-sharaf) the offerings of one or of two or\r\nthree of the Amirs were laid before me. On Monday, the 19th Farwardin,\r\nthe assembly of the Sharaf was held. On that auspicious day I sat\r\non the throne of State, and an order was given that they should\r\nproduce all sorts of intoxicating things, such as wine, etc., so\r\nthat every one according to his desire might take what he liked. Many\r\ntook wine. The offerings of Mahabat Khan were on this day brought to\r\nme. I gave one gold muhr of 1,000 tolas, which is called the star of\r\ndestiny (kaukab-i-tali`), to Yadgar `Ali Khan, the ambassador of the\r\nruler of Iran. The feast went off well. After the assembly broke up I\r\nordered that they might carry off the furniture and decorations. The\r\noffering of the Muqarrab Khan had not been arranged on New Year's\r\nDay. All sorts of rareties and excellent presents were now produced\r\nwhich he had collected together. Amongst others, twelve Iraq and Arab\r\nhorses that had been brought in a ship, and jewelled saddles of Frank\r\nworkmanship [384] were produced before me. To the mansab of Nawazish\r\nKhan 500 horse were added so as to make it one of 2,000 personal and\r\nhorse. An elephant called Bansibadan, which Islam Khan had sent from\r\nBengal, was brought to me and put among my special elephants. On the\r\n3rd Urdibihisht, Khwaja Yadgar, brother of `Abdu-llah Khan, came from\r\nGujarat and waited on me; he offered 100 Jahangiri muhrs. After he\r\nhad been in attendance a few days he was honoured with the title of\r\nSardar Khan. As a competent bakhshi had to be sent to the army of\r\nBangash and those regions, I chose Mu`taqid Khan for this duty, and\r\nincreased his mansab by 300 personal and 50 horse so that it became\r\n1,500 with 350 horse, and dismissed him. It was settled that he must\r\ngo quickly. I sent off Muhammad Husain Chelebi, who understood the\r\npurchase of jewels and collecting curiosities, with money to go by way\r\nof Iraq to Constantinople and buy and bring for the Sarkar curiosities\r\nand rareties. For this purpose it was necessary that he should pay\r\nhis respects to the ruler of Iran. I had given him a letter and a\r\nmemorandum (of what he was to procure). Briefly, he saw my brother,\r\nShah `Abbas, in Mashhad, and the king enquired from him what kind of\r\nthings should be brought for his master's Sarkar. As he was urgent,\r\nChelebi showed the list he had brought with him. In that list there\r\nwere entered good turquoise and mumiya (bitumen) from the mine of\r\nIspahan. He told him that these two articles were not to be bought,\r\nbut he would send them for me. He authorized Uwaisi Tupchi (gunner),\r\nwho was one of his private servants, to hand over to him six bags\r\n(ambancha) of turquoise earth holding about 30 seers, with 14 tolas\r\nof mumiya and four Iraq horses, one of which was a piebald, and he\r\nwrote a letter containing many, many expressions of friendship. With\r\nregard to the inferior quality of the turquoise dust (khaka) and the\r\nsmall quantity of mumiya he made many apologies. The khaka appeared\r\nvery inferior. Although the jewellers and makers of rings made every\r\nendeavour, no stone that was fit to be made into a finger ring could\r\nbe produced. Probably in these days turquoise dust is not procurable\r\nfrom the mines such as it was in the time of the late king Tahmasp. He\r\nmentioned all this in the letter. With regard to the effect of mumiya\r\nI had heard much from scientists, but when I tried it no result\r\nwas apparent. I do not know whether physicians have exaggerated\r\nits effect, or whether its efficacy had been lessened by its being\r\nstale. At any rate, I gave it to a fowl with a broken leg to drink\r\nin larger quantity than they said and in the manner laid down by the\r\nphysicians, and rubbed some on the place where it was broken, and kept\r\nit there for three days, though it was said to be sufficient to keep\r\nit from morning till evening. But after I had examined it, no effect\r\nwas produced, and the broken place remained as it was. [385] In a\r\nseparate letter the Shah had written a recommendation of Salamu-llah,\r\nthe Arab. I immediately increased his mansab and his jagir.\r\n\r\nI sent one of my private elephants with trappings to `Abdu-llah\r\nKhan and gave another to Qilij Khan. I ordered that assignments\r\n(tankhwah) should be made to 12,000 horse on the establishment [386]\r\nof `Abdu-llah Khan at the rate of three horses and two horses for\r\neach trooper. As previously with a view to service in Junagarh I\r\nhad increased the mansab of his brother Sardar Khan by 500 personal\r\nand 300 horse, and had afterwards assigned the duty to Kamil Khan,\r\nI ordered that he should retain his increase and that it should\r\nbe counted (permanently) in his mansab. I increased the rank of\r\nSarfaraz Khan, which was that of 1,500 personal and 500 horse, by\r\n200 horse more. On the 27th Urdibihisht, corresponding with the 26th\r\nRabi`u-l-awwal, in the eighth year of my reign, in the year 1022\r\nof the Hijra era, on Thursday, the meeting for my lunar weighing\r\ntook place in the house of Maryam-zamani (his mother). Some of the\r\nmoney that was weighed I ordered to be given to the women and the\r\ndeserving ones who had assembled in my mother's house. On the same\r\nday I increased by 1,000 the mansab of Murtaza Khan, so that it came\r\nto 6,000 personal and 5,000 horse. Khusrau Beg, a slave of Mirza Khan,\r\ncame from Patna in the company of `Abdu-r-Razzaq Ma`muri and waited on\r\nme, and Sardar Khan, brother of `Abdu-llah Khan, obtained leave to go\r\nto Ahmadabad. An Afghan had brought from the Carnatic two goats that\r\nhad pazahar (bezoar stones, an antidote against poison). I had always\r\nheard that an animal that has pazahar is very thin and miserable,\r\nbut these goats were very fat and fresh. I ordered them to kill one\r\nof them, which was a female. Four pazahar stones became apparent,\r\nand this caused great astonishment.\r\n\r\nIt is an established fact that cheetahs in unaccustomed places do not\r\npair off with a female, for my revered father once collected together\r\n1,000 cheetahs. He was very desirous that they should pair, but this\r\nin no way came off. He had many times coupled male and female cheetahs\r\ntogether in gardens, but there, too, it did not come off. At this time\r\na male cheetah, having slipped its collar, went to a female and paired\r\nwith it, and after two and a half months three young ones were born\r\nand grew up. This has been recorded because it appeared strange. As\r\ncheetahs did not pair with cheetahs, (still less) had it ever been\r\nheard in former times(?) that tigers mated in captivity. As in the\r\ntime of my reign wild beasts have abandoned their savagery, tigers have\r\nbecome so tame that troops of them without chains or restraint go about\r\namongst the people, and they neither harm men nor have any wildness\r\nor alarm. It happened that a tigress became pregnant and after three\r\nmonths bore three cubs; it had never happened that a wild tiger after\r\nits capture had paired. It had been heard from philosophers that the\r\nmilk of a tigress was of great use for brightening eyes. Although\r\nwe made every effort that the moisture of milk should appear in\r\nher breasts, we could not accomplish it. It occurs to me that as it\r\nis a raging creature, and milk appears in the breasts of mothers by\r\nreason of the affection they have for their young, as milk [387] comes\r\ninto their breasts in connection with their young ones drinking and\r\nsucking at the time of their taking (the milk), their (the mothers')\r\nrage increases and the milk in their breasts is dried up.\r\n\r\nAt the end of Urdibihisht, Khwaja Qasim, brother of Khwaja\r\n`Abdu-l-`Aziz, who is of the Naqshbandi Khwajas, came from\r\nMawara'a-n-nahr and waited on me. After a few days 12,000 rupees were\r\ngiven to him as a present. As Khwaja Jahan had made a melon-bed in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the city, when two watches of day had passed\r\non Thursday, the 10th Khurdad, I got into a boat and went to inspect\r\nthe melon-bed, and took the ladies with me. We reached there when two\r\nor three gharis of day were left, and passed the evening in walking\r\namong the beds. A wonderfully sharp wind and whirlwind sprang up, so\r\nthat the tents and screens fell down. I got into the boat and passed\r\nthe night in it. I also passed part of the Friday in walking about\r\nthe melon-bed, and returned to the city. Afzal Khan, who for a long\r\ntime had been afflicted with boils and other sores, died on the 10th\r\nKhurdad. I transferred the jagir and hereditary land of Raja Jagman,\r\nwho had failed in his service in the Deccan, to Mahabat Khan. Shaikh\r\nPir, who is one of the emancipated ones who hold aloof from the\r\nattachments of the age, and who on account of the pure friendship\r\nthat he bears towards me has chosen to be my companion and servant,\r\nhad before this founded a mosque in the parganah of Mairtha, which\r\nis his native place. At this time he took occasion to mention the\r\ncircumstance. As I found his mind bent on the completion of this\r\nbuilding I gave him 4,000 rupees, so that he himself might go and\r\nexpend it, and also gave him a valuable shawl and dismissed him. In the\r\npublic audience hall there were two railings (mahjar) of wood. Inside\r\nthe first, Amirs, ambassadors, and people of honour sat, and no one\r\nentered this circle without an order. Within the second railing,\r\nwhich is broader than the first, the mansabdars of inferior rank,\r\n[388] ahadis, and those who had work to do are admitted. Outside this\r\nrailing stand the servants of the Amirs and all the people who may\r\nenter the Diwankhana. As there was no difference between the first\r\nand second railings, it occurred to me that I should decorate the\r\nfirst with silver. I ordered this railing and the staircase that led\r\nfrom this railing to the balcony of the Jharokha, as well as the two\r\nelephants placed on the two sides of the seat of the Jharokha, which\r\nskilful people had made of wood, to be decorated with silver. After\r\nthis was completed it was reported to me that 125 maunds of silver in\r\nHindustani weight, equal to 880 maunds of Persia, had been used up;\r\nindeed, it now assumed a worthy appearance.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of the month of Tir, Muzaffar Khan came from Thatta [389]\r\nand waited on me. He made an offering of twelve muhrs and a Koran with\r\na jewelled cover, and two jewelled roses(?) (du gul). On the 14th of\r\nthe same month Safdar Khan came from the Subah of Behar and waited\r\non me, offering 101 muhrs. After Muzaffar Khan had been some days in\r\nattendance, I increased his former mansab by 500 personal, and giving\r\nhim a standard and a private shawl dismissed him to Thatta. [390]\r\n\r\nI knew that every animal or living thing bitten by a mad dog died,\r\nbut this had not been ascertained in the case of an elephant. In\r\nmy time it so happened that one night a mad dog came into the place\r\nwhere was tied one of my private elephants, Gajpati [391] by name,\r\nand bit the foot of a female elephant that was with mine. She at\r\nonce cried out. The elephant-keepers at once ran in, and the dog\r\nfled away into a thorn-brake that is there. After a little while it\r\ncame in again and bit my private elephant's fore-foot as well. The\r\nelephant killed it. When a month and five days had passed after this\r\nevent, one day when it was cloudy the growling of thunder came to\r\nthe ear of the female elephant, that was in the act of eating, and\r\nit of a sudden raised a cry and its limbs began to tremble. It threw\r\nitself on the ground, but rose again. For seven days water ran out\r\nof its mouth, then suddenly it uttered a cry and showed distress. The\r\nremedies the drivers gave it had no effect, and on the eighth day it\r\nfell and died. A month after the death of the female elephant they\r\ntook the large elephant to the edge of the river in the plain. It\r\nwas cloudy and thundery in the same way. The said elephant in the\r\nheight of excitement all at once began to tremble and sat down on the\r\nground. With a thousand difficulties the drivers took it to its own\r\nplace. After the same interval and in the same way that had happened\r\nto the female elephant this elephant also died. Great amazement was\r\ncaused by this affair, and in truth it is a matter to be wondered at\r\nthat an animal of such size and bulk should be so much affected by\r\na little wound inflicted on it by such a weak creature.\r\n\r\nAs Khankhanan had repeatedly begged for leave to be given to his son\r\nShah-nawaz Khan, on the 4th Amurdad I gave him a horse and a robe of\r\nhonour and dismissed him to the Deccan. I promoted Ya`qub Badakhshi,\r\nwhose mansab was 150, to 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse, on account\r\nof the bravery he had displayed, and gave him the title of Khan as\r\nwell as a standard.\r\n\r\nThe Hindus are in four divisions, and each of these acts according\r\nto its own rules and ways. In every year they keep a fixed day. The\r\nfirst is the caste of the Brahmans, [392] that is those who know\r\nthe Incomparable God. Their duties are of six kinds--(1) to acquire\r\nreligious knowledge, (2) to give instructions to others, (3) to\r\nworship fire, (4) to lead men to the worship of fire, (5) giving\r\nsomething to the needy, (6) taking gifts. There is for this caste\r\nan appointed day, and that is the last day of the month of Sawan,\r\nthe second month of the rainy season. [393] They consider this an\r\nauspicious day, and the worshippers go on that day to the banks of\r\nrivers and tanks, and recite enchantments, breathe upon cords and\r\ncoloured threads; on another day, which is the first of the New Year,\r\nthey fasten them on the hands of the Rajas and great men of the time,\r\nand look on them as (good) omens. They call this thread rakhi, [394]\r\nthat is, preservation (nigah-dasht). This day occurs in the month of\r\nTir, when the world-heating sun is in the constellation of Cancer. The\r\nsecond caste is that of the Chhatri, which is known as Khatri. Their\r\nduty is to protect the oppressed from the evil of the oppressors. The\r\ncustoms of this caste are three things--(1) that they study religious\r\nscience themselves but do not teach others; (2) that they worship fire,\r\nbut do not teach others to do so; (3) that they give to the needy, but\r\nalthough they are needy take nothing themselves. The day of this caste\r\nis the Bijay dasamin, 'the victorious tenth.' [395] On this day with\r\nthem it is lucky to mount and go against one's enemy with an army. Ram\r\nChand, whom they worship as their god, leading his army on that day\r\nagainst his enemy won a victory, and they consider this a great day,\r\nand, decorating their elephants and horses, perform worship. This day\r\nfalls in the month of Shahriwar, [396] when the Sun is in the mansion\r\nof Virgo, and on it they give presents to those who look after their\r\nhorses and elephants. The third caste is that of Baish (Vaishya). Its\r\ncustom is this, that they serve the other two castes of which mention\r\nhas been made. They practise agriculture and buying and selling, and\r\nare employed in the business of profit and interest. This caste has\r\nalso a fixed day which they call the Dewali; this day occurs in the\r\nmonth of Mihr when the sun is in the constellation of Libra, the 28th\r\nday of the lunar month. On the night of that day they light lamps,\r\nand friends and those who are dear assemble in each other's houses\r\nand pass their time busily in gambling. As the eyes of this caste\r\nare on profit and interest, they consider carrying over and opening\r\nnew accounts on that day auspicious. The fourth caste is the Sudras,\r\nwho are the lowest caste of the Hindus. They are the servants of all,\r\nand derive no profit from those things which are the specialities of\r\nevery (other) caste. Thursday is the Holi, which in their belief is the\r\nlast day of the year. This day occurs in the month of Isfandarmuz,\r\nwhen the sun is in the constellation of Pisces. On the night of\r\nthis day they light fires at the head of the streets and ways, and\r\nwhen it becomes day they for one watch scatter the ashes on each\r\nother's heads and faces, and make a wonderful noise and disturbance,\r\nand after this wash themselves, put on their apparel, and walk about\r\nin the gardens and on the plains. As it is an established custom of\r\nthe Hindus to burn the dead, to light fires on this night, which is\r\nthe last night of the year that has passed, signifies that they burn\r\nthe last year, which has gone to the abode of the dead. In the time\r\nof my revered father the Hindu Amirs and others in imitation of them\r\nperformed the ceremony of rakhi in adorning him, making strings of\r\nrubies and royal pearls and flowers jewelled with gems of great value\r\nand binding them on his auspicious arms. This custom was carried on\r\nfor some years. As they carried this extravagance to excess, and he\r\ndisliked it, he forbade it. The brahmans by way of auguries used to\r\ntie these strings and (pieces of) silk according to their custom. I\r\nalso in this year carried out this laudable religious practice,\r\nand ordered that the Hindu Amirs and the heads of the caste [397]\r\nshould fasten rakhis on my arms. On the day of the rakhi, which was\r\nthe 9th Amurdad, they performed the same rites, and other castes by\r\nway of imitation did not give up this bigotry; this year I agreed to\r\nit, and ordered that the brahmans should bind strings (of cotton)\r\nand silk after the ancient manner. On this day by chance fell the\r\nanniversary of the death of the late king. [398] The commemoration\r\nof such an anniversary is one of the standing rules and customs in\r\nHindustan. Every year on the day of the death of their fathers and\r\nthose who are dear to them, each according to his circumstances and\r\nability prepares food and all kinds of perfumes, and the learned men,\r\nthe respectable and other men assemble, and these assemblies sometimes\r\nlast a week. On this day I sent Baba Khurram to the venerated tomb to\r\narrange the assemblage, and 10,000 rupees were given to ten trustworthy\r\nservants to divide among fakirs and those who were in want.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of the month of Amurdad the offering of Islam Khan was\r\nlaid before me. He had sent 28 elephants, 40 horses of that part of\r\nthe country which are known as tanghan, 50 eunuchs, 500 pargala nafis\r\nsitarkani. [399]\r\n\r\nIt had been made a rule that the events of the Subahs should be\r\nreported according to the boundaries of each, and news-writers from\r\nthe Court had been appointed for this duty. This being the rule that\r\nmy revered father had laid down, I also observe it, and much gain\r\nand great advantage are to be brought about by it and information is\r\nacquired about the world and its inhabitants. If the advantages of\r\nthis were to be written down it would become a long affair. At this\r\ntime the news-writer of Lahore reported that at the end of the month\r\nof Tir ten men had gone from the city to Amanabad, which lies at a\r\ndistance of 12 kos. As the air was very hot, they took shelter under\r\na tree. Soon afterwards wind and a dust-storm (chakri) sprang up,\r\nand when it blew on that band of men they trembled, and nine of them\r\ndied under the tree, and only one remained alive; he was ill for a long\r\ntime, and recovered with great difficulty. In that neighbourhood such\r\nbad air was created that numerous birds who had their nests in that\r\ntree all fell down and died, and that the wild beasts (beasts of the\r\nplain, perhaps cattle) came and threw themselves on to the cultivated\r\nfields, and, rolling about on the grass, gave up their lives. In short,\r\nmany animals perished. On Thursday, the 13th Amurdad, having said my\r\nprayers (lit. counted my rosary), I embarked on board a boat for the\r\npurpose of hunting in the village of Samonagar, which is one of my\r\nfixed hunting-places. On the 3rd Shahriwar, Khan `Alam, whom I had\r\nsent for from the Deccan in order to despatch him to Iraq in company\r\nwith the ambassador of the ruler of Iran, came and waited on me at\r\nthis place. He offered 100 muhrs. As Samonagar was in Mahabat Khan's\r\njagir, he had prepared a delightful halting-place there on the bank\r\nof the river, and it pleased me greatly. He presented offerings of\r\nan elephant and an emerald ring. The former was put into my private\r\nstud. Up to the 6th Shahriwar I was employed in hunting. In these\r\nfew days 47 head of antelope, male and female, and other animals were\r\nkilled. At this time Dilawar Khan sent as an offering a ruby, which\r\nwas accepted. I sent a special sword for Islam Khan. I increased\r\nthe mansab of Hasan `Ali Turkuman, which was 1,000 personal and\r\n700 horse, by 500 personal and 100 horse. At the end of Thursday,\r\nthe 20th of the same month, in the house of Maryam-zamani, my solar\r\nweighing took place. I weighed myself according to the usual custom\r\nagainst metals and other things. I had this year attained to the age\r\nof 44 solar years. On the same day Yadgar `Ali, ambassador of the\r\nruler of Iran, and Khan `Alam, who had been nominated to accompany\r\nhim from this side, received their leave to go. On Yadgar `Ali there\r\nwere bestowed a horse with a jewelled saddle, a jewelled sword, a\r\nvest without sleeves with gold embroidery, an aigrette with feathers\r\nand a jigha (turban ornament), and 30,000 rupees in cash, altogether\r\n40,000 rupees, and on Khan `Alam a jewelled khapwa or phul katara\r\n(a sort of dagger) with a pendant of royal pearls. On the 22nd of the\r\nsame month I visited the venerated mausoleum of my revered father at\r\nBihishtabad, riding on an elephant. On the way 5,000 rupees in small\r\ncoin were scattered round, and I gave other 5,000 rupees to Khwaja\r\nJahan to divide among the dervishes. Having said my evening prayers,\r\nI went back to the city in a boat. As the house of I`timadu-d-daulah\r\nwas on the bank of the river Jumna, I alighted there until the end\r\nof the next day. Having accepted what pleased me of his offerings,\r\nI went towards the palace; I`tiqad Khan's house was also on the bank\r\nof the river Jumna; at his request I disembarked there with the ladies,\r\nand walked round the houses he had lately built there. This delightful\r\nplace pleased me greatly. He had produced suitable offerings of cloth\r\nstuffs and jewels and other things; these were all laid before me and\r\nmost of them were approved. When it was near evening I entered the\r\nauspicious palace. As the astrologers had fixed an hour in this night\r\nfor starting for Ajmir, when seven gharis of the night of Monday,\r\nthe 2nd Sha`ban, corresponding with the 24th Shahriwar, had passed,\r\nI started in happiness and prosperity with intent to go there from\r\nthe capital of Agra. In this undertaking two things were agreeable to\r\nme, one a pilgrimage to the splendid mausoleum of Khwaja Mu`inu-d-din\r\nChishti, from the blessing of whose illustrious soul great advantages\r\nhad been derived by this dignified family, and whose venerable shrine\r\nI had not visited after my accession to the throne. The second was\r\nthe defeat and beating back of the rebel Rana Amar Singh, who is one\r\nof the most considerable of the Zamindars and Rajas of Hindustan,\r\nand whose headship and leadership and those of his ancestors all the\r\nRajas and Rays of this province agree to. The administration has for\r\nlong been in the hands of this family, and they have long borne rule\r\ntowards the East, that is the Purab. They became in that time well\r\nknown under the title of Rajas. After this they fell on the Deccan\r\n[400] and took possession of many of the countries of that region. In\r\nthe place of Raja they have taken the title of Rawal. After this they\r\ncame into the hill country of Mewat, and by degrees got into their\r\npossession the fort of Chitor. From that date until this day, which is\r\nin the eighth year after my accession, 1,471 years have passed. [401]\r\n\r\nThere are twenty-six others of this caste who have ruled for 1,010\r\nyears. They have the title of Rawal, and from the Rawal who was\r\nfirst known as Rawal down to Rana Amar Singh, the present Rana,\r\nthere are twenty-six individuals who have ruled for the space of\r\n461 years. During this long time they have never bent their necks\r\nin obedience to any of the kings of the country of Hindustan, and\r\nhave for most of the time been rebellious and troublesome, so much\r\nso that in the reign of the late king Babar, Rana Sanga collected\r\ntogether all the Rajas, Rays, and Zamindars of this province, and\r\nfought a battle in the neighbourhood of Biyana with 180,000 horse and\r\nseveral lakhs of foot-soldiers. By the aid of Almighty God and the\r\nassistance of fortune the victorious army of Islam prevailed against\r\nthe infidel forces, and a great defeat happened to them. The details\r\nof this battle have been given in the Memoirs of King Babar. My\r\nrevered father (may his bright tomb be the abode of unending Grace)\r\nexerted himself greatly to put down these rebels, and several times\r\nsent armies against them. In the twelfth year after his accession\r\nhe set himself to capture the fort of Chitor, which is one of the\r\nstrongest forts of the inhabited world, and to overthrow the kingdom\r\nof the Rana, and after four months and ten days of siege took it by\r\nforce from the men of Amar Singh's father, after much fighting, and\r\nreturned after destroying the fort. Every time the victorious forces\r\npressed him hard in order to capture him or make him a fugitive, but\r\nit so happened that this was not effected. In the end of his reign,\r\non the same day and hour that he proceeded to the conquest of the\r\nDeccan, he sent me with a large army and reliable Sardars against the\r\nRana. By chance these two affairs, for reasons which it would take\r\ntoo long to recount, did not succeed. At last I came to the throne,\r\nand as this matter was only half done, the first army I sent to the\r\nborders was this one. Making my son Parwiz its leader, the leading\r\nnobles who were at the capital were appointed to this duty. I sent\r\nabundant treasure and artillery with him. As every matter depends\r\non its own season, at this juncture the unhappy affair of Khusrau\r\noccurred, and I had to pursue him to the Panjab. The province and the\r\ncapital of Agra remained void. I had necessarily to write that Parwiz\r\nshould return with some of the Amirs and take charge of Agra and the\r\nneighbourhood. In short, this time again the matter of the Rana did\r\nnot go off as it should. When by the favour of Allah my mind was at\r\nrest from Khusrau's disturbance, and Agra became again the alighting\r\nplace of the royal standards, a victorious army was appointed under\r\nthe leadership of Mahabat Khan, `Abdu-llah Khan, and other leaders,\r\nand from that date up to the time when the royal standards started for\r\nAjmir his country was trodden under foot by the victorious forces. As\r\nfinally the affair did not assume an approved form, it occurred to\r\nme that, as I had nothing to do at Agra, and I was convinced that\r\nuntil I myself went there the affair would not be set to rights, I\r\nleft the fort of Agra and alighted at the Dahrah garden. On the next\r\nday the festival of the Dasahra took place. According to the usual\r\ncustom they decorated the elephants and horses, and I had them before\r\nme. As the mothers and sisters of Khusrau repeatedly represented to\r\nme that he was very repentant of his deeds, the feelings (lit. sweat)\r\nof fatherly affection having come into movement, I sent for him and\r\ndetermined that he should come every day to pay his respects to me. I\r\nremained for eight days in that garden. On the 28th news arrived that\r\nRaja Ram Das, who was doing service in Bangash and the neighbourhood\r\nof Kabul with Qilij Khan, had died. On the 1st of the month of Mihr I\r\nmarched from the garden, and dismissed Khwaja Jahan to look after the\r\ncapital of Agra and guard the treasure and the palace, and gave him\r\nan elephant and a special robe (fargul). On the 2nd Mihr news arrived\r\nthat Raja Baso had died in the thanah of Shahabad, [402] which is on\r\nthe border of the territory of Amar. On the 10th of the same month\r\nI halted at Rup Bas, which has now been named Amanabad. Formerly\r\nthis district had been given as jagir to Rup Khawass. Afterwards,\r\nbestowing it on Amanu-llah, son of Mahabat Khan, I ordered it to be\r\ncalled by his name. Eleven days were passed at this halting-place. As\r\nit is a fixed hunting-place, I every day mounted to go hunting, and\r\nin these few days 158 antelopes, male and female, and other animals\r\nwere killed. On the 25th of the month I marched from Amanabad. On the\r\n31st, corresponding with the 8th Ramazan, Khwaja Abu-l-hasan, whom\r\nI had sent for from Burhanpur, came and waited on me, and presented\r\nas offerings 50 muhrs, 15 jewelled vessels, and an elephant, which\r\nI placed in my private stud. On the 2nd Aban, corresponding with\r\nthe 10th Ramazan, news came of the death of Qilij Khan. He was one\r\nof the ancient servants of the State, and obtained the mercy of God\r\nin the 80th year of his age. He was employed at Peshawar in the duty\r\nof keeping in order the Afghans full of darkness. [403] His rank was\r\n6,000 personal and 5,000 horse. Murtaza Khan Dakhani was unrivalled\r\nin the art of pulta-bazi, which in the language of the Dakhanis\r\nthey call yaganagi, and the Moguls shamshir-bazi, 'sword-play'\r\n(fencing). For some time I studied it with him. At this time I exalted\r\nhim with the title of Warzish Khan (Exercise-Khan). I had established\r\na custom that deserving people and dervishes should be brought before\r\nme every night, so that I might bestow on them, after personal enquiry\r\ninto their condition, land, or gold, or clothes. Amongst these was a\r\nman who represented to me that the name Jahangir, according to the\r\nscience of abjad (numerals reckoned by letters), corresponded to\r\nthe great name \"Allah Akbar.\" [404] Considering this a good omen,\r\nI gave him who discovered (this coincidence) land, a horse, cash,\r\nand clothing. On Monday, the 5th Shawwal, corresponding to the 26th\r\nAban, the hour for entering Ajmir was fixed. On the morning of the\r\nsaid day I went towards it. When the fort and the buildings of the\r\nshrine of the revered Khwaja appeared in sight, I traversed on foot\r\nthe remainder of the road, about a kos. I placed trustworthy men on\r\nboth sides of the road, who went along giving money to fakirs and the\r\nnecessitous. When four gharis of day had passed, I entered the city\r\nand its inhabited portion, and in the fifth ghari had the honour of\r\nvisiting the venerated mausoleum. After visiting it I proceeded to the\r\nauspicious palace, and the next day ordered all those present in this\r\nhonoured resting-place, both small and great, belonging to the city,\r\nand travellers, to be brought before me, that they might be made\r\nhappy with numerous gifts according to their real circumstances. On\r\nthe 7th Azar I went to see and shoot on the tank of Pushkar, which is\r\none of the established praying-places of the Hindus, with regard to the\r\nperfection of which they give (excellent) accounts that are incredible\r\nto any intelligence, and which is situated at a distance of three kos\r\nfrom Ajmir. For two or three days I shot water-fowl on that tank,\r\nand returned to Ajmir. Old and new temples which, in the language\r\nof the infidels, they call Deohara [405] are to be seen around this\r\ntank. Among them Rana Shankar, who is the uncle of the rebel Amar,\r\nand in my kingdom is among the high nobles, had built a Deohara of\r\ngreat magnificence, on which 100,000 rupees had been spent. I went\r\nto see that temple. I found a form cut out of black stone, which\r\nfrom the neck above was in the shape of a pig's head, and the rest\r\nof the body was like that of a man. The worthless religion of the\r\nHindus is this, that once on a time for some particular object the\r\nSupreme Ruler thought it necessary to show himself in this shape; on\r\nthis account they hold it dear and worship it. [406] I ordered them\r\nto break that hideous form and throw it into the tank. After looking\r\nat this building there appeared a white dome on the top of a hill,\r\nto which men were coming from all quarters. When I asked about this\r\nthey said that a Jogi lived there, and when the simpletons come to see\r\nhim he places in their hands a handful [407] of flour, which they put\r\ninto their mouths and imitate the cry of an animal which these fools\r\nhave at some time injured, in order that by this act their sins may\r\nbe blotted out. I ordered them to break down that place and turn the\r\nJogi out of it, as well as to destroy the form of an idol there was\r\nin the dome. Another belief they have is that there is no bottom to\r\nthis tank. After enquiry it appeared that it is nowhere deeper than\r\n12 cubits. I also measured it round and it was about 1 1/2 kos.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th Azar news came that the watchmen had marked down a\r\ntigress. I immediately went there and killed it with a gun and\r\nreturned. After a few days a nilgaw (blue bull) was killed, of which I\r\nordered them to take off the skin in my presence and cook it as food\r\nfor the poor. Over 200 people assembled and ate it, and I gave money\r\nwith my own hand to each of them. In the same month news came that the\r\nFranks of Goa had, contrary to treaty, plundered four cargo vessels\r\n[408] that frequented the port of Surat in the neighbourhood of that\r\nport: and, making prisoners a large number of Musulmans, had taken\r\npossession of the goods and chattels that were in those ships. This\r\nbeing very disagreeable to my mind, I despatched Muqarrab Khan,\r\nwho is in charge of the port, on the 18th Azar, giving him a horse\r\nand elephant and a dress of honour, to obtain compensation for this\r\naffair. On account of the great activity and good services of Yusuf\r\nKhan and Bahaduru-l-mulk in the Subah of the Deccan, I sent standards\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\nIt has been written that my chief object, after my visit to the Khwaja,\r\nwas to put a stop to the affair of the rebel Rana. On this account\r\nI determined to remain myself at Ajmir and send on Baba Khurram, my\r\nfortunate son. This idea was a very good one, and on this account,\r\non the 6th of Day, at the hour fixed upon, I despatched him in\r\nhappiness and triumph. I presented him with a qaba (outer coat) of\r\ngold brocade with jewelled flowers and pearls round the flowers,\r\na brocaded turban with strings of pearls, a gold woven sash with\r\nchains of pearls, one of my private elephants called Fath Gaj, with\r\ntrappings, a special horse, a jewelled sword, and a jewelled khapwa,\r\nwith a phul katara. In addition to the men first appointed to this\r\nduty under the leadership of Khan A`zam, I sent 12,000 more horse with\r\nmy son, and honoured their leaders, each according to his condition,\r\nwith special horses and elephants and robes of honour, and dismissed\r\nthem. Fida'i Khan was nominated to the paymastership of this army. At\r\nthe same time Safdar Khan was despatched to the government of Kashmir\r\nin place of Hashim Khan. He received a horse and robe of honour. On\r\nWednesday, the 11th, Khwaja Abu-l-hasan was made general paymaster\r\n(bakhshi-kul), and received a dress of honour. I had ordered them to\r\nmake a large caldron [409] at Agra for the revered mausoleum of the\r\nKhwaja. On this day it was brought, and I ordered them to cook food\r\nfor the poor in that pot, and collect together the poor of Ajmir\r\nto feed them whilst I was there. Five thousand people assembled,\r\nand all ate of this food to their fill. After the food I gave money\r\nto each of the dervishes with my own hand. At this time Islam Khan,\r\ngovernor of Bengal, was promoted to the mansab of 6,000 personal and\r\nhorse, and a flag was given to Mukarram Khan, son of Mu`azzam Khan.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of Isfandarmuz, corresponding with the 10th Muharram, 1023\r\n(20th February, 1614), I left Ajmir to hunt nilgaw, and returned on\r\nthe 9th. I halted at the fountain of Hafiz Jamal, [410] two kos from\r\nthe city, and passed the night of Friday [411] there. At the end of\r\nthe day I entered the city. In these twenty days ten nilgaw had been\r\nkilled. As the good service of Khwaja Jahan and the smallness of his\r\nforce for the defence and government of Agra and that neighbourhood\r\nwere brought to my notice, I increased his mansab by 500 personal and\r\n100 horse. On the same day Abu-l-fath Dakhani came from his jagir and\r\nwaited on me. On the 3rd of the same month news came of the death of\r\nIslam Khan; he had died on Thursday, the 5th Rajab, in the year 1022\r\n(21st August, 1613). In one day, without any previous illness, this\r\ninevitable event occurred. He was one of those born and brought up in\r\nthe house (house-born). The naturally good disposition and knowledge\r\nof affairs that showed themselves in him were seen in no one else. He\r\nruled Bengal with entire authority, and brought within the civil\r\njurisdiction of the province countries that had never previously come\r\nunder the sway of any of the jagirdars or into the possession of any\r\nof the Chiefs of the State. If death had not overtaken him he would\r\nhave done perfect service.\r\n\r\nThe Khan A`zam had himself prayed that the illustrious prince should\r\nbe appointed to the campaign against the Rana, yet, notwithstanding\r\nall kinds of encouragement and gratification on the part of my son\r\n(Shah Jahan), he would not apply himself to the task, but proceeded\r\nto act in his own unworthy manner. When this was heard by me, I sent\r\nIbrahim Husain, who was one of my most trusty attendants, to him,\r\nand sent affectionate messages to him to say that when he was at\r\nBurhanpur he had daily begged this duty of me, as he considered it\r\nequivalent to the happiness of both worlds, and had said in meetings\r\nand assemblies that if he should be killed in this enterprise he would\r\nbe a martyr, and if he prevailed, a ghazi. I had given him whatever\r\nsupport and assistance of artillery he had asked for. After this he\r\nhad written that without the movement of the royal standards to those\r\nregions the completion of the affair was not free of difficulty. By\r\nhis counsel I had come to Ajmir, and this neighbourhood had been\r\nthus honoured and dignified. Now that he had himself prayed for the\r\nprince, and everything had been carried out according to his counsel,\r\nwhy did he withdraw his foot from the field of battle and enter the\r\nplace of disagreement? To Baba Khurram, from whom up till now I had\r\nnever parted, and whom I sent in pure reliance on his (Khan A`zam's)\r\nknowledge of affairs, he should show loyalty and approved good-will,\r\nand never be neglectful day or night of his duty to my son. If,\r\ncontrariwise, he should draw back his foot from what he had agreed\r\nto, he must know that there would be mischief. Ibrahim Husain\r\nwent, and impressed these words on his mind in the same detailed\r\nway. It was of no avail, as he would not go back from his folly and\r\ndetermination. When Baba Khurram saw that his being in the affair was\r\na cause of disturbance, he kept him under observation and represented\r\nthat his being there was in no way fitting, and he was acting thus\r\nand spoiling matters simply on account of the connection he had with\r\nKhusrau. [412] I then ordered Mahabat Khan to go and bring him from\r\nUdaipur, and told Muhammad Taqi, the diwan of buildings, to go to\r\nMandesur and bring his children and dependants to Ajmir.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of the month news came that Dulip, son of Ray Singh,\r\nwho was of a seditious and rebellious disposition, had been heavily\r\ndefeated by his younger brother, Rao Suraj Singh, who had been\r\nsent against him, and that he was making disturbance in one of the\r\ndistricts of the Sarkar of Hissar. About this time Hashim of Khost,\r\nthe faujdar, and the jagirdars of that neighbourhood seized him, and\r\nsent him as a prisoner to Court. As he had misbehaved repeatedly,\r\nhe was capitally punished, and this was a warning to many of the\r\nseditious. In reward for this service an increase of 500 personal\r\nand 200 horse was made to the mansab of Rao Suraj Singh. On the 14th\r\nof the month a representation came from my son Baba Khurram that the\r\nelephant `Alam-guman, of which the Rana was very fond, together with\r\nseventeen other elephants, had fallen into the hands of the warriors of\r\nthe victorious army, and that his master would also soon be captured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NINTH NEW YEAR'S FEAST AFTER MY AUSPICIOUS ACCESSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe commencement of the ninth year after my auspicious accession,\r\ncorresponding with the Hijra year 1023 (1614).\r\n\r\nTwo watches and one ghari had passed on the night of Friday, the 9th\r\nSafar (21st March, 1614), when the world-warming sun shed his rays on\r\nthe constellation of Aries, which is his house of dignity and honour;\r\nit was the first morning of the month of Farwardin. The assembly for\r\nthe New Year's festival took place in the pleasant regions of Ajmir,\r\nand at the time of entry (of the sun into Aries), which was the\r\npropitious hour, I seated myself on the throne of good fortune. They\r\nhad in the usual manner decorated the palace with rare cloth-stuffs and\r\njewels and gem-decked things. At this auspicious moment the elephant\r\n`Alam-guman, [413] which was fit to be entered in the private stud,\r\nwith the seventeen other male and female elephants which my son Baba\r\nKhurram had sent of the Rana's elephants, were presented before me,\r\nand the hearts of the loyal rejoiced. On the 2nd day of the New Year,\r\nknowing it to be propitious for a ride, I mounted it and scattered\r\nabout much money. On the 3rd I conferred on I`tiqad Khan a mansab\r\nof 3,000 personal and 1,000 horse, increasing thus that which\r\nhe had already, which was of 2,000 personal and 500 horse, and I\r\ndistinguished him with the title of Asaf Khan, with which title two\r\nof his family had been previously honoured. I also increased the\r\nmansab of Dayanat Khan by 500 personal and 200 horse. At the same\r\ntime I promoted I`timadu-d-daulah to the mansab of 5,000 personal\r\nand 2,000 horse. At the request of Baba Khurram I increased the\r\nmansab of Saif Khan Barha by 500 personal and 200 horse, that of\r\nDilawar Khan by the same number, that of Kishan Singh by 500 horse,\r\nand that of Sarfaraz Khan by 500 personal and 300 horse. On Sunday,\r\nthe 10th, the offering of Asaf Khan was produced before me, and on\r\nthe 14th I`timadu-d-daulah produced his own offering. From these two\r\nofferings I took what pleased me and gave back the rest. Chin Qilij\r\nKhan, with his brothers, relations, and the army and retinue of his\r\nfather, came from Kabul [414] and waited on me. Ibrahim Khan, who had\r\na mansab of 700 personal and 300 horse, having been promoted to that\r\nof 1,500 personal and 600 horse, was appointed jointly with Khwaja\r\nAbu-l-hasan to the exalted dignity of paymaster of the household. On\r\nthe 15th of this month Mahabat Khan, who had been appointed to bring\r\nKhan A`zam and his son `Abdu-llah, came and waited on me. On the 19th\r\nthe assembly of honour was held. On that day the offering of Mahabat\r\nKhan was laid before me, and I sent a private elephant called Rup\r\nSundar for my son Parwiz. When that day had passed I ordered them to\r\ndeliver Khan A`zam into the charge of Asaf Khan, that he might keep him\r\nin the fort of Gwalior. As my object in sending him to the fort was\r\nin case some disagreement and disturbance should occur in the matter\r\nof the Rana in consequence of the attachment that he had to Khusrau,\r\nI ordered him not to be kept in the fort like a prisoner, but that they\r\nshould provide everything necessary for his comfort and convenience in\r\nthe way of eating and clothing. On the same day I promoted Chin Qilij\r\nKhan to a mansab of 2,500 personal and 700 horse. To the rank of Taj\r\nKhan, who had been appointed to the charge of the province of Bhakar,\r\nI added 500 personal and horse. On the 18th Urdibihisht I forbade\r\nKhusrau to pay his respects. The reason was this, that through the\r\naffection and fatherly love (I bore him) and the prayers of his mother\r\nand sisters, I had ordered again that he should come every day to pay\r\nhis respects (kurnish). As his appearance showed no signs of openness\r\nand happiness, and he was always mournful and dejected in mind, I\r\naccordingly ordered that he should not come to pay his respects. In\r\nthe time of my revered father, Muzaffar Husain Mirza and Rustam Mirza,\r\nsons of Sultan Husain Mirza, nephews of Shah Tahmasp Safawi, who had\r\nin their possession Qandahar and Zamindawar and that neighbourhood,\r\nsent petitions to the effect that in consequence of the nearness to\r\nKhurasan and the coming of `Abdu-llah Khan Uzbeg to that country,\r\nthey could not leave the charge of looking after the country and come\r\n(to pay their respects), but that if he (Akbar) would send one of\r\nthe servants of the palace they would hand over the country to him,\r\nand themselves come to pay their respects. As they repeatedly made\r\nthis request, he sent Shah Beg Khan, who is now honoured with the\r\ntitle of Khan Dauran, to the governorship of Qandahar and Zamindawar\r\nand that neighbourhood, and wrote firmans full of favour to the Mirzas\r\nsummoning them to the Court. After their arrival favours appropriate to\r\nthe case of each were bestowed on them, and he gave them a territory\r\nequal to two or three times the collections of Qandahar. In the end,\r\nthe management expected from them was not achieved, and by degrees the\r\nterritory deteriorated. Muzaffar Husain Mirza died during the lifetime\r\nof my revered father, and he sent Mirza Rustam with the Khankhanan to\r\nthe Subah of the Deccan, where he had a small jagir. When the throne\r\nwas honoured by my succession, I sent for him from the Deccan with the\r\nintention of showing him favour and sending him to one of the border\r\nterritories. About the time he came Mirza Ghazi Tarkhan, who held the\r\ngovernorship of Thatta and Qandahar and that neighbourhood, died. It\r\noccurred to me to send him to Thatta, so that he might show there\r\nhis natural good qualities and administer that country in an approved\r\nmanner. I promoted him to a mansab of 5,000 personal and horse, 200,000\r\nrupees were given to him for expenses, and I despatched him to the\r\nSubah of Thatta. My belief was that he would do good service [415]\r\non those borders. In opposition to my expectation he did no service,\r\nand committed so much oppression that many people complained of his\r\nwickedness. Such news of him was heard that it was considered necessary\r\nto recall him. One of the servants of the Court was appointed to summon\r\nhim, and I sent for him to Court. On the 26th Urdibihisht they brought\r\nhim. As he had committed great oppression on the people of God, and\r\ninquiry into this was due according to the requirements of justice,\r\nI handed him over to Anira'i Singh-dalan that he might enquire into\r\nthe facts, and that if guilty he might receive prompt punishment and\r\nbe a warning to others. In those days the news also came of the defeat\r\nof Ahdad, the Afghan. The facts are that Mu`taqid Khan came to Pulam\r\n[416] Guzar (ferry?), in the district of Peshawar, with an army,\r\nand Khan Dauran with another force in Afghanistan and blocked the\r\npath of that rascal (lit. black-faced one). Meanwhile a letter came\r\nto Mu`taqid Khan from Pish Bulagh that Ahdad had gone to Kot Tirah,\r\nwhich is 8 kos from Jalalabad, with a large number of horse and foot,\r\nand had killed a few of those who had chosen to be loyal and obey,\r\nand made prisoners of others, and was about to send them to Tirah,\r\nand intended to make a raid on Jalalabad and Pish Bulagh. Immediately\r\non hearing this news Mu`taqid Khan started in great haste with the\r\ntroops he had with him. When he arrived at Pish Bulagh he sent out\r\nspies to ascertain about the enemy. On the morning of Wednesday, the\r\n6th, news reached him that Ahdad was in the same place. Placing his\r\ntrust on the favour of God, which is on the side of this suppliant\r\nat the throne of Allah, he divided the royal army into two, and\r\nwent towards the enemy, who, with 4,000 or 5,000 experienced men,\r\nhad seated themselves haughtily in complete carelessness, and did\r\nnot suspect that besides Khan Dauran's there was an army in the\r\nneighbourhood that could oppose itself to them. When news came that\r\nthe royal forces were coming against that ill-fortuned man, and the\r\nsigns of an army were becoming manifest, in a state of bewilderment\r\nhe distributed his men into four bodies, and seating himself on an\r\neminence a gunshot away, to get to which was a difficult matter, he\r\nsent his men to fight. The musketeers of the victorious army assailed\r\nthe rebel with bullets, and sent a large number to hell. Mu`taqid Khan\r\ntook the centre of his army to his advanced guard, and, not giving\r\nthe enemy more than time to shoot off their arrows two or three times,\r\nswept them clean away, and pursuing them for 3 or 4 kos, killed nearly\r\n1,500 of them, horse and foot. Those left of the sword took to flight,\r\nmost of them wounded and with their arms thrown away. The victorious\r\narmy remained for the night in the same place on the battlefield,\r\nand in the morning proceeded with 600 decapitated heads [417]\r\ntowards Peshawar and made pillars of the heads there. Five hundred\r\nhorses and innumerable cattle and property and many weapons fell into\r\ntheir hands. The prisoners of Tirah were released, and on this side\r\nno well-known men were killed. On the night of Thursday, the 1st of\r\nKhurdad, I proceeded towards Pushkar to shoot tigers, and on Friday\r\nkilled two of them with a gun. On the same day it was represented to\r\nme that Naqib Khan had died. The aforesaid Khan was one of the Saifi\r\nSayyids, and was originally from Qazwin. The tomb of his father, Mir\r\n`Abdu-l-Latif, is at Ajmir. Two months before his death his wife,\r\n[418] between whom and her husband there was a great affection, and\r\nwho for twelve days was ill with fever, drank the unpleasant draught\r\nof death. I ordered them to bury him by the side of his wife, whom\r\nthey had placed in the Khwaja's venerated mausoleum. As Mu`taqid Khan\r\nhad done approved service in the fight with Ahdad, in reward he was\r\nexalted with the title of Lashkar Khan. Dayanat Khan, who had been\r\nsent to Udaipur in the service of Baba Khurram and to convey certain\r\norders, came on the 7th Khurdad and gave good account of the rules\r\nand regulations made by Baba Khurram. Fida'i Khan, who in the days\r\nof my princehood was my servant, and whom after my accession I had\r\nmade bakhshi in this army, and who had obtained favour, gave up the\r\ndeposit of his life on the 12th of the same month. Mirza Rustam,\r\nas he showed signs of repentance and regret for his misdeeds, and\r\ngenerosity demanded that his faults should be pardoned, was, in the\r\nend of the month, summoned to my presence, and I satisfied his mind,\r\nand having given him a dress of honour, ordered him to pay his respects\r\nto me. On the night of Sunday, the 11th of the month of Tir, a female\r\nelephant in the private elephant stud gave birth to a young one in my\r\npresence. I had repeatedly ordered them to ascertain the period of\r\ntheir gestation; at last it became evident that for a female young\r\none it was 18 months and for a male 19 months. In opposition to the\r\nbirth of a human being, which is in most cases by a head delivery,\r\nyoung elephants are born with their feet first. When the young one was\r\nborn, the mother scattered dust upon it with her foot, and began to\r\nbe kind and to pet it. The young one for an instant remained fallen,\r\nand then rising, made towards its mother's breasts. On the 14th the\r\nassembly of Gulab-pashi (sprinkling of rose-water) took place; from\r\nformer times this has been known as ab-pashi (water-sprinkling),\r\nand has become established from amongst customs of former days. On\r\nthe 5th Amurdad (middle July, 1614) came news of the death of Raja\r\nMan Singh. [419] The aforesaid Raja was one of the chief officers of\r\nmy revered father. As I had sent many servants of the State to serve\r\nin the Deccan, I also appointed him. After his death in that service,\r\nI sent for Mirza Bhao Singh, who was his legitimate heir. As from the\r\ntime when I was prince he had done much service with me, although the\r\nchiefship and headship of their family, according to the Hindu custom,\r\nshould go to Maha Singh, son [420] of Jagat Singh, the Raja's eldest\r\nson, who had died in the latter's lifetime, I did not accept him,\r\nbut I dignified Bhao Singh with the title of Mirza Raja, and raised\r\nhim to the mansab of 4,000 personal and 3,000 horse. I also gave\r\nhim Amber, the native place of his ancestors, and, soothing and\r\nconsoling the mind of Maha Singh, increased his former mansab by\r\n500, and gave him as an in`am the territory of Garha. [421] I also\r\nsent him a jewelled dagger belt, a horse, and dress of honour. On\r\nthe 8th of this month of Amurdad I found a change in my health,\r\nand by degrees was seized with fever and headache. For fear that\r\nsome injury might occur to the country and the servants of God,\r\nI kept this secret from most of those familiar with and near to me,\r\nand did not inform the physicians and hakims. A few days passed in\r\nthis manner, and I only imparted this to Nur-Jahan Begam than whom I\r\ndid not think anyone was fonder of me; I abstained from eating heavy\r\nfoods, and, contenting myself with a little light food, went every day,\r\naccording to my rule, to the public Diwan-khana (hall of audience),\r\nand entered the Jharokha and ghusal-khana (parlour) in my usual manner,\r\nuntil signs of weakness showed themselves in my skin. [422] Some of\r\nthe nobles [423] became aware of this, and informed one or two of my\r\nphysicians who were trustworthy, such as Hakim Masihu-z-zaman, Hakim\r\nAbu-l-qasim, and Hakim `Abdu-sh-Shakur. As the fever did not change,\r\nand for three nights I took my usual wine, it brought on greater\r\nweakness. In the time of disquietude, and when weakness prevailed\r\nover me, I went to the mausoleum of the revered Khwaja, and in that\r\nblessed abode prayed to God Almighty for recovery, and agreed to give\r\nalms and charity. God Almighty, in His pure grace and mercy, bestowed\r\non me the robe of honour of health, and by degrees I recovered. The\r\nheadache, which had been very severe, subsided under the remedies\r\nof Hakim `Abdu-sh-Shakur, and in the space of twenty-two days my\r\nstate returned to what it was before. The servants of the palace,\r\nand indeed the whole of the people, made offerings for this great\r\nbounty. I accepted the alms of no one, and ordered that everyone in\r\nhis own house should distribute what he wished among the poor. On the\r\n10th Shahriwar news came that Taj Khan, the Afghan, governor of Thatta,\r\n[424] had died; he was one of the old nobles of the State.\r\n\r\nDuring my illness it had occurred to me that when I completely\r\nrecovered, inasmuch as I was inwardly an ear-bored slave of the\r\nKhwaja (Mu`inu-d-din) and was indebted to him for my existence,\r\nI should openly make holes in my ears and be enrolled among his\r\near-marked slaves. On Thursday, 12th Shahriwar, [425] corresponding\r\nto the month of Rajab, I made holes in my ears and drew into each a\r\nshining pearl. When the servants of the palace and my loyal friends\r\nsaw this, both those who were in the presence and some who were in\r\nthe distant borders diligently and eagerly made holes in their ears,\r\nand adorned the beauty of sincerity with pearls and rubies which were\r\nin the private treasury, and were bestowed on them, until by degrees\r\nthe infection caught the Ahadis and others. At the end of the day\r\nof Thursday, the 22nd of the said month, corresponding with the 10th\r\nSha`ban, the meeting for my solar weighing was arranged in my private\r\naudience hall, and the usual observances were carried out. On the\r\nsame day Mirza Raja Bhao Singh, gratified and prosperous, returned to\r\nhis native country with the promise that he would not delay (there)\r\nmore than two or three months. On the 27th of the month of Mihr news\r\ncame that Faridun Khan Barlas had died at Udaipur. In the clan of\r\nBarlas no leader remained but he. As his tribe had many claims on\r\nthis State and endless connection with it, I patronised his son Mihr\r\n`Ali, and raised him to the mansab of 1,000 personal and horse. On\r\naccount of the approved services of Khan Dauran, I increased by 1,000\r\nhis mansab, which became 6,000 personal and 5,000 horse, original and\r\nincrease. On the 6th Aban the qarawuls (shikaris) reported that three\r\ntigers had been met at a distance of 6 kos. Starting after midday,\r\nI killed all three of them with a gun. On the 8th of the month the\r\nfestival of the Dewali came on. I ordered the attendants of the\r\npalace to have games with each other for two or three nights in my\r\npresence; winnings and losings took place. On the 8th of this month\r\nthey brought to Ajmir the body of Sikandar Mu`in Qarawul (Shikari),\r\nwho was one of my old attendants and had done much service for me when\r\nI was prince, from Udaipur, which was the place where my son Sultan\r\nKhurram was staying. I ordered the qarawuls and his fellow-tribesmen\r\nto take his body and bury it on the bank of Rana Shankar's tank. He\r\nwas a good servant to me. On the 12th Azar two daughters whom Islam\r\nKhan in his lifetime had taken from the Zamindar of Kuch (Behar),\r\nwhose country is on the boundary of the eastern provinces, together\r\nwith his son and 94 elephants, were brought before me. Some of the\r\nelephants were placed in my private stud. On the same day, Hushang,\r\nIslam Khan's son, came from Bengal, and had the good fortune to kiss\r\nthe threshold, and presented as offerings two elephants, 100 muhrs,\r\nand 100 rupees. On one particular night in Day I dreamt that the late\r\nking (Akbar) said to me: \"Baba, forgive for my sake the fault of\r\n`Aziz Khan, who is the Khan A`zam.\" After this dream, I decided to\r\nsummon him from the fort (of Gwalior).\r\n\r\nThere is a ravine in the neighbourhood of Ajmir that is very\r\nbeautiful. At the end of this ravine a spring appears which\r\nis collected in a long and broad tank, and is the best water in\r\nAjmir. This valley and spring are well known as Hafiz Jamal. When I\r\ncrossed over to this place I ordered a suitable building to be made\r\nthere, as the place was good and fit for developing. In the course of\r\na year a house and grounds were made there, the like of which those\r\n[426] who travel round the world cannot point out. They made a basin\r\n40 gaz by 40, and made the water of the spring rise up in the basin\r\nby a fountain. The fountain leaps up 10 or 12 gaz. Buildings are laid\r\non the edge of this basin, and in the same way above, where the tank\r\nand fountain are, they have made agreeable places and enchanting\r\nhalls and resting-rooms pleasant to the senses. These have been\r\nconstructed and finished off in a masterly style by skilled painters\r\nand clever artists. As I desired that it should be called by a name\r\nconnected with my august name, I gave it the name of Chashma-i-Nur,\r\nor 'the fountain of light.' In short, the one fault it has is this,\r\nthat it ought to have been in a large city, or at a place by which\r\nmen frequently pass. From the day on which it was completed I have\r\noften passed Thursdays and Fridays there. I ordered that they should\r\nthink out a chronogram for its completion. Sa`ida Gilani, the head\r\nof the goldsmiths, discovered it in this clever hemistich:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"The palace [427] of Shah Nuru-d-din Jahangir\" (1024).\r\n\r\n\r\nI ordered them to put a stone with this carved upon it on the top of\r\nthe portico of the building.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the month of Day, merchants came from Persia\r\nand brought pomegranates of Yazd and melons from Kariz, which are\r\nthe best of Khurasan melons, so many that all the servants of the\r\nCourt and the Amirs of the frontiers obtained a portion of them and\r\nwere very grateful to the True Giver (God) for them. I had never\r\nhad such melons and pomegranates. It seemed as if I had never had\r\na pomegranate or a melon before. Every year I had had melons from\r\nBadakhshan and pomegranates from Kabul, but they bore no comparison\r\nwith the Yazd pomegranates and the Kariz melons. As my revered father\r\n(may God's light be his witness!) had a great liking for fruit, I was\r\nvery grieved that such fruits had not come to Hindustan from Persia in\r\nhis victorious time, that he might have enjoyed and profited by them. I\r\nhave the same regret for the Jahangiri `itr (so-called otto of roses),\r\nthat his nostrils were not gratified with such essences. This `itr\r\nis a discovery which was made during my reign through the efforts of\r\nthe mother of Nur-Jahan Begam. When she was making rose-water a scum\r\nformed on the surface of the dishes into which the hot rose-water\r\nwas poured from the jugs. She collected this scum little by little;\r\nwhen much rose-water was obtained a sensible portion of the scum\r\nwas collected. It is of such strength in perfume that if one drop\r\nbe rubbed on the palm of the hand it scents a whole assembly, and\r\nit appears as if many red rosebuds had bloomed at once. There is no\r\nother scent of equal excellence to it. It restores hearts that have\r\ngone and brings back withered souls. In reward for that invention I\r\npresented a string of pearls to the inventress. Salima [428] Sultan\r\nBegam (may the lights of God be on her tomb) was present, and she\r\ngave this oil the name of '`itr-i-Jahangiri.'\r\n\r\nGreat difference appeared in the climates of India. In this\r\nmonth of Day, in Lahore, which is between Persia and Hindustan,\r\nthe mulberry-tree bore fruit of as much sweetness and fine flavour\r\nas in its ordinary season. For some days people were delighted by\r\neating it. The news-writers of that place wrote this. In the same\r\ndays Bakhtar Khan Kalawant, who was closely connected with `Adil\r\nKhan, inasmuch as he (`Adil) married his own brother's daughter to\r\nhim, and made him his preceptor in singing and durpat [429] guftan,\r\nappeared in the habit of a dervish. Summoning him and enquiring into\r\nhis circumstances, I endeavoured to honour him. In the first assembly I\r\ngave him 10,000 rupees in cash and 50 pieces of cloth of all sorts and\r\na string of pearls, and having made him a guest of Asaf Khan, ordered\r\nhim to enquire into his circumstances. It did not appear whether he\r\nhad come without `Adil Khan's permission, or the latter had sent him\r\nin this guise in order that he might find out the designs of this\r\nCourt and bring him news about them. Considering his relationship to\r\n`Adil Khan, it is most probable that he has not come without `Adil\r\nKhan's knowledge. A report by Mir Jamalu-d-din Husain, who at this\r\ntime was (our) ambassador at Bijapur, corroborates this idea, for\r\nhe writes that `Adil Khan has, on account of the kindness which has\r\nbeen shown by H.M. (Jahangir) to Bakhtar Khan, been very gracious\r\nto him (Jamalu-d-din). Every day he has shown him more and more\r\nfavour, keeps him beside him at nights, and recites to him durpats,\r\nwhich he (`Adil Khan) has composed, and which he calls nauras [430]\r\n(Juvenilia). \"The remainder of the facts will be written on the day\r\nwhen I get my dismissal.\"\r\n\r\nIn these days they brought a bird from the country of Zirbad (Sumatra,\r\netc., Blochmann, p. 616) which was coloured like a parrot, but had\r\na smaller body. One of its peculiarities is that it lays hold with\r\nits feet of the branch or perch on which they may have placed it and\r\nthen makes a somersault, and remains in this position all night and\r\nwhispers to itself. When day comes it seats itself on the top of the\r\nbranch. Though they say that animals also have worship, yet it is most\r\nlikely that this practice is instinctive. It never drinks water, and\r\nwater acts like poison upon it, though other birds subsist on water.\r\n\r\nIn the month [431] of Bahman there came pieces of good news one\r\nafter the other. The first was that the Rana Amar Singh had elected\r\nfor obedience and service to the Court. The circumstances of this\r\naffair are these. My son of lofty fortune, Sultan Khurram, by dint\r\nof placing a great many posts, especially in some places where\r\nmost people said it was impossible to place them on account of the\r\nbadness of the air and water and the wild nature of the localities,\r\nand by dint of moving the royal forces one after another in pursuit,\r\nwithout regard to the heat or excessive rain, and making prisoners\r\nof the families of the inhabitants of that region, brought matters\r\nwith the Rana to such a pass that it became clear to him that if this\r\nshould happen to him again he must either fly the country or be made\r\nprisoner. Being without remedy, he chose obedience and loyalty, and\r\nsent to my fortunate son his maternal uncle, Subh Karan, with Haridas\r\nJhala, who was one of the men in his confidence, and petitioned that\r\nif that fortunate son would ask forgiveness for his offences and\r\ntranquillise his mind, and obtain for him the auspicious sign-manual,\r\n[432] he would himself come and wait on my son, and would send his son\r\nand successor Karan to Court, or he, after the manner of other Rajas,\r\nwould be enrolled amongst the servants of the Court and do service. He\r\nalso begged that he himself might be excused from coming to Court on\r\naccount of his old age. Accordingly my son sent them in company with\r\nhis own Diwan Mulla Shukru-llah, whom after the conclusion of this\r\nbusiness I dignified with the title of Afzal Khan, and Sundar Das,\r\nhis major-domo, who, after this matter was settled, was honoured with\r\nthe title of Ray Rayan, to the exalted Court, and represented the\r\ncircumstances. My lofty mind was always desirous, as far as possible,\r\nnot to destroy the old families. The real point was that as Rana Amar\r\nSingh and his fathers, proud in the strength of their hilly country and\r\ntheir abodes, had never seen or obeyed any of the kings of Hindustan,\r\nthis should be brought about in my reign. At the request of my son I\r\nforgave the Rana's offences, and gave a gracious farman that should\r\nsatisfy him, and impressed on it the mark of my auspicious palm. [433]\r\nI also wrote a farman of kindness to my son that if he could arrange\r\nto settle the matter I should be much pleased. My son also sent them\r\n[434] with Mulla Shukru-llah and Sundar Das to the Rana to console\r\nhim and make him hopeful of the royal favour. They gave him the\r\ngracious farman with the sign-manual of the auspicious hand, and it\r\nwas settled that on Sunday, the 26th of the month of Bahman, he and\r\nhis sons should come and pay their respects to my son. The second\r\npiece of good news was the death of Bahadur, who was descended from\r\nthe rulers of Gujarat, and was the leaven of disturbance and mischief\r\n(there). Almighty God had annihilated him in His mercy: he died of a\r\nnatural illness. The third piece of news was the defeat of the Warza\r\n(Portuguese Viceroy), who had done his best to take the castle and\r\nport of Surat. In the roadstead [435] of the port of Surat a fight\r\ntook place between the English, who had taken shelter there, and\r\nthe Viceroy. Most of his ships were burnt by the English fire. Being\r\nhelpless he had not the power to fight any more, and took to flight. He\r\nsent some one to Muqarrab Khan, who was the governor of the ports of\r\nGujarat, and knocked at the door of peace, and said that he had come\r\nto make peace and not to make war. It was the English who had stirred\r\nup the war. Another piece of news was that some of the Rajputs, who\r\nhad determined to attack and kill `Ambar (misprinted Ghir), had made\r\nan ambush, and finding a good opportunity had gained access to him,\r\nwhen a slight wound had been inflicted on him by one of them. The men\r\nwho were round `Ambar (again misprinted Ghir) had killed the Rajputs\r\nand taken `Ambar to his quarters. A very little [436] more would have\r\nmade an end of him. In the end of this month, when I was employed in\r\nhunting in the environs of Ajmir, Muhammad Beg, [437] an attendant\r\non my fortunate son Sultan Khurram, came and brought a report from\r\nthat son, and stated that the Rana had come with his sons and paid\r\nhis respects to the prince; \"the details would be made known by the\r\nreport.\" I immediately turned the face of supplication to the Divine\r\nCourt, and prostrated myself in thanksgiving. I presented a horse,\r\nan elephant, and a jewelled dagger to the aforesaid Muhammad Beg, and\r\nhonoured him with the title of Zu-l-faqar Khan.2 From the report it\r\nappeared that on Sunday, the 26th Bahman, the Rana paid his respects\r\nto my fortunate son with the politeness and ritual that servants pay\r\ntheir respects, and produced as offerings a famous large ruby that\r\nwas in his house, with some decorated articles and seven elephants,\r\nsome of them fit for the private stud, and which had not fallen into\r\nour hands and were the only ones left him, and nine horses.\r\n\r\nMy son also behaved to him with perfect kindness. When the Rana\r\nclasped his feet and asked forgiveness for his faults, he took his\r\nhead and placed it on his breast, and consoled him in such a manner\r\nas to comfort him. He presented him with a superb dress of honour,\r\na jewelled sword, a horse with a jewelled saddle, and a private\r\nelephant with silver housings, and, as there were not more than 100\r\nmen with him who were worthy of complete robes of honour (sar u pa),\r\nhe gave 100 sarupa and 50 horses and 12 jewelled khapwa (daggers). As\r\nit is the custom of the Zamindars that the son who is the heir-apparent\r\nshould not go with his father to pay his respects to a king or prince,\r\nthe Rana observed this custom, and did not bring with him Karan,\r\nthe son who had received the tika. As the hour (fixed by astrology)\r\nof the departure of that son of lofty fortune from that place was\r\nthe end of that same day, he gave him leave, so that, having himself\r\ngone, he might send Karan to pay his respects. After he had gone,\r\nKaran also came and did so. To him also he gave a superb dress of\r\nhonour, a jewelled sword and dagger, a horse with a gold saddle, and\r\na special elephant, and on the same day, taking Karan in attendance,\r\nhe proceeded towards the illustrious Court. On the 3rd Isfandarmuz my\r\nreturn to Ajmir from hunting took place. From the 17th Bahman up to\r\nthat date, during which I was hunting, one tigress with three cubs\r\nand thirteen nilgaw had been killed. The fortunate prince encamped\r\non Saturday, the 10th of the same month, at the village of Devrani,\r\nwhich is near the city of Ajmir, and an order was given that all the\r\nAmirs should go to meet him, and that each should present an offering\r\naccording to his standing and condition, and on the next day, Sunday,\r\nthe 11th he should have the good fortune to wait upon me. The next\r\nday the prince, with great magnificence, with all the victorious\r\nforces that had been appointed to accompany him on that service,\r\nentered the public palace. The hour for him to wait on me was when\r\ntwo watches and two gharis of the day had passed, and he had the\r\ngood fortune to pay his respects, and performed his prostrations and\r\nsalutations. He presented 1,000 ashrafis and 1,000 rupees by way of\r\noffering, 1,000 muhrs and 1,000 rupees by way of charity. I called\r\nthat son forward and embraced him, and having kissed his head and\r\nface, favoured him with special kindnesses and greetings. When he\r\nhad finished the dues of service and had presented his offerings and\r\ncharities, he petitioned that Karan might be exalted with the good\r\nfortune of prostrating himself and paying his respects. I ordered them\r\nto bring him, and the Bakhshis with the usual ceremonies of respect\r\nproduced him. After prostration and salutation were completed, at\r\nthe request of my son Khurram, I ordered them to place him in front\r\non the right hand of the circle. After this I ordered Khurram to\r\ngo and wait on his mothers, and gave him a special dress of honour,\r\nconsisting of a jewelled charqab (sleeveless vest), a coat of gold\r\nbrocade, and a rosary of pearls. After he had made his salutation,\r\nthere were presented to him a special dress of honour, a special horse\r\nwith a jewelled saddle, and a special elephant. I also honoured Karan\r\nwith a superb robe of honour and a jewelled sword, and the Amirs and\r\nmansabdars had the honour of prostrating themselves and paying their\r\nrespects, and presented their offerings. Each of these, according to\r\nhis service and rank, was honoured with favours. As it was necessary\r\nto win the heart of Karan, who was of a wild nature and had never seen\r\nassemblies and had lived among the hills, I every day showed him some\r\nfresh favour, so that on the second day of his attendance a jewelled\r\ndagger, and on the next day a special Iraqi horse with jewelled saddle,\r\nwere given to him. On the day when he went to the darbar in the\r\nfemale apartments, there were given to him on the part of Nur-Jahan\r\nBegam a rich dress of honour, a jewelled sword, a horse and saddle,\r\nand an elephant. After this I presented him with a rosary of pearls\r\nof great value. On the next day a special elephant with trappings\r\n(talayir) were given. As it was in my mind to give him something\r\nof every kind, I presented him with three hawks and three falcons,\r\na special sword, a coat of mail, a special cuirass, and two rings,\r\none with a ruby and one with an emerald. At the end of the month I\r\nordered that all sorts of cloth stuffs, with carpets and cushions\r\n(named takiya) and all kinds of perfumes, with vessels of gold, two\r\nGujrati carts, and cloths, should be placed in a hundred trays. The\r\nAhadis carried them in their arms and on their shoulders to the public\r\naudience hall, where they were bestowed on him.\r\n\r\nSabit Khan [438] at the paradise-resembling assemblies was always\r\naddressing unbecoming speeches and making palpable allusions to\r\nI`timadu-d-daulah and his son Asaf Khan. Once or twice, showing\r\nmy dislike of this, I had forbidden him to do so, but this was not\r\nenough for him. As I held very dear I`timadu-d-daulah's good-will\r\ntowards me, and was very closely connected with his family, this\r\nmatter became very irksome to me. As one night without reason and\r\nwithout motive he began to speak unpleasant words to him, and said\r\nthem to such an extent that signs of vexation and annoyance became\r\nevident in I`timadu-d-daulah's face, I sent him next morning, in the\r\ncustody of a servant of the Court, to Asaf Khan to say that as on the\r\nprevious evening he had spoken unpleasant words to his father I handed\r\nhim over to him, and he might shut him up either there or in the fort\r\nof Gwalior, as he pleased; until he made amends to his father I would\r\nnever forgive his fault. According to the order Asaf Khan sent him to\r\nGwalior fort. In the same month Jahangir Quli Khan was promoted to\r\nan increased mansab, and was given that of 2,500 personal and 2,000\r\nhorse. Ahmad Beg Khan, who is one of the old retainers of the State,\r\ncommitted some faults on the journey to the Subah of Kabul, and Qilij\r\nKhan, who was the commander of the army, had repeatedly complained of\r\nhis making himself disagreeable. Necessarily I summoned him to Court,\r\nand in order to punish him handed him over to Mahabat Khan to confine\r\nhim in the fort of Rantambhor. Qasim Khan, governor of Bengal, had\r\nsent two rubies as an offering, and they were laid before me. As I\r\nhad made a rule that they should bring before me after two watches\r\nof the night had passed the dervishes and necessitous people who had\r\ncollected in the illustrious palace, this year also after the same\r\nmanner I bestowed on the dervishes with my own hand and in my own\r\npresence 55,000 rupees and 190,000 bighas of land, with fourteen\r\nentire villages, and twenty-six ploughs, [439] and 11,000 kharwar\r\n[440] (ass-loads) of rice; I presented as well 732 pearls, of the\r\nvalue of 36,000 rupees, to the servants who by way of loyalty had\r\nbored their ears.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the aforesaid month news came that when four and a\r\nhalf gharis of night had passed on Sunday the 11th of the month, in\r\nthe city of Burhanpur, God Almighty had bestowed on Sultan Parwiz a\r\nson by the daughter of Prince Murad. I gave him the name of Sultan\r\nDur-andish [441] (long-thoughted).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TENTH NEW YEAR'S FESTIVAL AFTER MY AUSPICIOUS ACCESSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen 55 seconds had passed on Saturday, 1st Farwardin, in my 10th\r\nyear, corresponding with the 8th [442] of the month of Safar (March,\r\n1615), 1024 Hijra, the sun from the constellation of Pisces entered the\r\nhouse of honour of Aries. When three gharis had passed on the night of\r\nSunday I seated myself on the throne of State. The New Year's feast\r\nand ceremonials were prepared in the usual manner. The illustrious\r\nprinces, the great Khans, the chief officers and Ministers of State\r\nmade their salutations of congratulation. On the 1st of the month\r\nthe mansab of I`timadu-d-daulah was increased from 5,000 personal and\r\n2,000 horse by 1,000 personal and horse. Special horses were given to\r\nthe Kunwar Karan, Jahangir Quli Khan, and Raja Bir Singh Deo. On the\r\n2nd the offering of Asaf Khan was laid before me; it was an approved\r\noffering of jewels and jewelled ornaments and things of gold, of\r\ncloth stuffs of all kinds and descriptions and was looked over in\r\ndetail. That which I approved was worth 85,000 rupees. On this day a\r\njewelled sword with a belt and band(?) (band u bar) was given to Karan,\r\nand an elephant to Jahangir Quli Khan. As I had made up my mind to\r\nproceed to the Deccan, I gave an order to `Abdu-l-Karim Ma`muri, to\r\ngo to Mandu and prepare a new building for my private residence and\r\nrepair the buildings of the old kings. On the 3rd day the offerings\r\nof Raja Bir Singh Deo were laid before me and one ruby, some pearls,\r\nand one elephant had the honour of being accepted. On the 4th day the\r\nmansab of Mustafa Khan was increased by 500 personal and 200 horse\r\nto 2,000 personal and 250 horse. On the 5th I gave a standard and\r\ndrums to I`timadu-d-daulah, and an order was given him to beat his\r\ndrums. The mansab of Asaf Khan was increased by 1,000 personal and\r\nhorse to 4,000 personal and 2,000 horse, and having increased the\r\nmansab of Raja Bir Singh Deo by 700 horse, I dismissed him to his\r\nown country, directing that he should present himself at Court at\r\nstated periods. On the same day the offering of Ibrahim Khan was laid\r\nbefore me. Some of all the kinds of things pleased me. Kishan Chand,\r\nof the sons of the Rajas of Nagarkot, was honoured with the title of\r\nRaja. On Thursday, the 6th, the offerings of I`timadu-d-daulah were\r\nlaid before me at Chashma-i-Nur; a large meeting had been arranged,\r\nand by way of favour the whole of his offerings were inspected. Of\r\nthe jewels and jewelled things and choice cloth stuffs the value of\r\n100,000 rupees was accepted, and the remainder given back. On the 7th\r\nday I increased by 1,000 personal the mansab of Kishan Singh, which had\r\nbeen 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse. On this day a tiger was killed in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Chashma-i-Nur. On the 8th I gave Karan the mansab\r\nof 5,000 personal and horse, and gave him a small rosary of pearls and\r\nemeralds with a ruby in the centre which in the language of the Hindus\r\nis called smaran (Sanskrit for 'remembrance'). I increased the mansab\r\nof Ibrahim Khan by 1,000 personal and 400 horse, so as to make it 2,000\r\npersonal and 1,000 horse, original and increase. The mansab of Haji Bi\r\nUzbeg was increased by 300 horse, and that of Raja Shyam Singh by 500\r\npersonal so as to make it 2,500 personal and 1,400 horse. On Sunday,\r\nthe 9th, there was an eclipse of the sun when twelve gharis of the day\r\nhad passed. It began from the west, and four out of five parts of the\r\nsun were eclipsed in the knot of the dragon. From the commencement of\r\nthe seizure until it became light eight gharis elapsed. Alms of all\r\nkinds, and things in the shape of metals, animals, and vegetables,\r\nwere given to fakirs and the poor and people in need. On this day\r\nthe offering of Raja Suraj Singh was laid before me; what was taken\r\nwas of the value of 43,000 rupees. The offering of Bahadur Khan, the\r\ngovernor of Qandahar, was also laid before me on this day; its total\r\nvalue came to 14,000 rupees. Two watches of the night had passed on the\r\nnight of Monday, the 29th Safar (30th March, 1615), in the ascension\r\nof Sagittarius, when a boy was born to Baba Khurram by the daughter\r\nof Asaf Khan; I gave him the name of Dara Shukuh. I hope that his\r\ncoming will be propitious to this State conjoined with eternity,\r\nand to his fortunate father. The mansab of Sayyid `Ali Barha was\r\nincreased by 500 personal and 300 horse, so as to bring it to 1,500\r\npersonal and 1,000 horse. On the 10th the offering of I`tibar Khan\r\nwas laid before me, and what was of the value of 40,000 rupees was\r\naccepted. On this day the mansab of Khusrau Bi Uzbeg was raised by\r\n300 horse, and that of Mangli Khan by 500 personal and 200 horse. On\r\nthe 11th the offering of Murtaza Khan was laid before me. Of it seven\r\nrubies, one rosary of pearls, and 270 other pearls were accepted, and\r\ntheir value was 145,000 rupees. On the 12th the offerings of Mirza\r\nRaja Bhao Singh and Rawat Shankar were laid before me. On the 13th,\r\nout of the offering of Khwaja Abu-l-hasan, one qutbi (Egyptian?) ruby,\r\none diamond, one string of pearls, five rings, four pearls, and some\r\ncloths, altogether the value of 32,000 rupees, were accepted. On the\r\n14th the mansab of Khwaja Abu-l-hasan, which was 3,000 personal and\r\n700 horse, was increased by 1,000 personal and 500 horse, and that\r\nof Wafadar Khan, of 750 personal and 200 horse, by 2,000 personal\r\nand 1,200 horse. On the same day Mustafa Beg, the ambassador of the\r\nruler of Iran, had the good fortune to wait upon me. After completing\r\nthe matter of Gurjistan (Georgia), my exalted brother sent him with\r\na letter consisting of expressions of friendship and assurances of\r\nsincerity, with several horses, camels, and some stuffs from Aleppo,\r\nwhich had come for that fortunate brother from the direction of\r\nRum. Nine large European hunting dogs, for which a request had gone,\r\nwere also sent by him.\r\n\r\nMurtaza Khan, on this day, obtained leave to go for the capture\r\nof the fort of Kangra, the equal of which for strength they cannot\r\npoint to in the hill country of the Panjab or even all the habitable\r\nworld. From the time when the sound of Islam reached the country\r\nof Hindustan up to this auspicious time when the throne of rule\r\nhas been adorned by this suppliant at the throne of Allah, none of\r\nthe rulers or kings has obtained possession of it. Once in the time\r\nof my revered father, the army of the Panjab was sent against this\r\nfort, and besieged it for a long time. At length they came to the\r\nconclusion that the fort was not to be taken, and the army was sent\r\noff to some more necessary business. When he was dismissed, I gave\r\nMurtaza Khan a private elephant with trappings. Raja Suraj Mal, son\r\nof Raja Baso, as his country was near that fort, was also appointed,\r\nand his previous mansab was increased by 500 personal and horse. Raja\r\nSuraj Singh also came from his place and jagir and waited on me, and\r\npresented an offering of 100 ashrafis. On the 17th the offering of\r\nMirza Rustam was laid before me. Two jewelled daggers, one rosary of\r\npearls, some pieces of cloth, an elephant, and four Iraq horses were\r\naccepted, and the rest returned; their value was 15,000 rupees. On\r\nthe same date the offering of I`tiqad Khan, of the value of 18,000\r\nrupees, was laid before me. On the 18th the offering of Jahangir\r\nQuli Khan was inspected. Of jewels and cloth stuffs the value of\r\n15,000 rupees was accepted. The mansab of I`tiqad Khan, which was 700\r\npersonal and 200 horse, I increased by 800 personal and 300 horse,\r\nso that with original and increase it came to 1,500 personal and 500\r\nhorse. Khusrau Bi Uzbeg, who was one of the distinguished soldiers,\r\ndied of the disease of dysentery. On the 8th day, which was Thursday,\r\nafter two watches and four and a half gharis had passed, the sharaf\r\n(highest point of the sun's ascension) began. On this auspicious day I\r\nascended the throne in happiness and prosperity, and the people saluted\r\nand congratulated me. When one watch of the day remained I went to the\r\nChashma-i-Nur. According to agreement the offering of Mahabat Khan\r\nwas laid before me at that place. He had arranged beautiful jewels\r\nand jewellery, with cloth stuff and articles of all kinds that were\r\npleasing to me. Among these, a jewelled khapwa (dagger), which at\r\nhis request the royal artificers had made, and the like of which in\r\nvalue there did not exist in my private treasury, was worth 100,000\r\nrupees. In addition to this, jewels and other things of the value\r\nof 138,000 rupees were taken. Indeed, it was a splendid offering. To\r\nMustafa Beg, the ambassador of the ruler of Iran, I gave 20,000 darab,\r\nor 10,000 rupees. On the 21st I sent robes of honour by the hand of\r\n`Abdu-l-Ghafur to fifteen of the Amirs of the Deccan. Raja Bikramajit\r\nobtained leave to go to his jagir, and a special shawl (parm narm\r\n[443]) was given to him. On the same day I gave a jewelled waist-dagger\r\nto Mustafa Beg, the ambassador. I increased the mansab of Hushang,\r\nthe son of Islam Khan, which was 1,000 personal and 500 horse, by 500\r\npersonal and 200 horse. On the 23rd, Ibrahim Khan was promoted to the\r\nSubah of Behar. Zafar Khan was ordered to present himself at Court. To\r\nthe mansab of Ibrahim Khan, which was 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse,\r\nI added 500 personal and 1,000 horse. Saif Khan on the same day was\r\ndismissed to his jagir, as well as Haji Bi Uzbeg, who was honoured\r\nwith the title of Uzbeg Khan. Bahaduru-l-mulk, who belonged to the\r\narmy of the Deccan and held the mansab of 2,500 personal and 2,100\r\nhorse received an increase of 500 personal and 200 horse. An increase\r\nof 200 was made in the mansab of Khwaja Taqi, which was 800 personal\r\nand 180 horse. On the 25th an increase of 200 horse was made in the\r\nrank of Salamu-llah, the Arab, so that it became 1,500 personal and\r\n1,000 horse. I presented Mahabat Khan with the black piebald horse\r\nout of my special horses which the ruler of Iran had sent me. At\r\nthe end of the day of Thursday I went to the house of Baba Khurram\r\nand remained there till a watch of the night had passed. His second\r\noffering was laid before me on that day. On the first day he paid his\r\nrespects he laid before me a celebrated ruby of the Rana, which, on the\r\nday of his paying his respects, he had made an offering of to my son,\r\nand which the jewellers valued at 60,000 rupees. It was not worthy of\r\nthe praise they had given it. The weight of this ruby was eight tank,\r\n[444] and it was formerly in the possession of Ray Maldeo, who was the\r\nchief of the tribe of the Rathors and one of the chief rulers (or Rays)\r\nof Hindustan. From him it was transferred to his son Chandar Sen, who,\r\nin the days of his wretchedness and hopelessness, sold it to Rana\r\nUday Singh. From him it went to Rana Partap, and afterwards to this\r\nRana Amar Singh. As they had no more valuable gift in their family,\r\nhe presented it on the day that he paid his respects to my fortunate\r\nson Baba Khurram, together with the whole of his stud of elephants,\r\nwhich, according to the Indian idiom, they call gheta char. [445]\r\nI ordered them to engrave on the ruby that at the time of paying his\r\nrespects Rana Amar Singh had presented it as an offering to Sultan\r\nKhurram. On that day certain other things from among the offerings of\r\nBaba Khurram were accepted. Among them was a little crystal box of\r\nFrank work, made with great taste, with some emeralds, three rings,\r\nfour Iraq horses, and various other things, the value of which was\r\n80,000 rupees. On the day on which I went to his house he had prepared\r\na great offering, in fact there were laid before me things and rarities\r\nworth about four or five lakhs of rupees. Of these the equivalent of\r\n100,000 rupees was taken away and the balance given to him.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th the mansab of Khwaja Jahan, which was 3,000 personal and\r\n1,800 horse, was increased by 500 personal and 400 horse. In the end\r\nof the month I presented Ibrahim Khan with a horse, a robe of honour,\r\na jewelled dagger, a standard and drums, and dismissed him to the\r\nprovince of Behar. The office of `arz-mukarrir (reviser of petitions),\r\nthat belonged to Khwajagi Haji Muhammad, as he had died, I gave to\r\nMukhlis Khan, who was in my confidence. Three hundred horse were\r\nincreased in the mansab of Dilawar Khan, who now had 1,000 personal\r\nand horse. As the hour of the leave-taking of Kunwar Karan was at hand,\r\nI was desirous of showing him my skill in shooting with a gun. Just at\r\nthis time the qarawulan (shikaris) brought in news of a tigress. Though\r\nit is an established custom of mine only to hunt male tigers, yet,\r\nin consideration that no other tiger might be obtained before his\r\ndeparture, I went for the tigress. I took with me Karan, and said\r\nto him that I would hit it wherever he wished me to do so. After\r\nthis arrangement I went to the place where they had marked down the\r\ntiger. By chance there was a wind and disturbance in the air, and the\r\nfemale elephant on which I was mounted was terrified of the tigress\r\nand would not stand still. Notwithstanding these two great obstacles\r\nto shooting, I shot straight towards her eye. God Almighty did not\r\nallow me to be ashamed before that prince, and, as I had agreed,\r\nI shot her in the eye. On the same day Karan petitioned me for a\r\nspecial gun, and I gave him a special Turkish one.\r\n\r\nAs on the day for his departure I had not given Ibrahim Khan an\r\nelephant, I now gave him a special elephant, and I also sent an\r\nelephant to Bahaduru-l-mulk and one to Wafadar Khan. On the 8th\r\nUrdibihisht the assemblage for my lunar weighing was held, and I\r\nweighed myself against silver and other things, distributing them\r\namongst the deserving and needy. Nawazish Khan took leave to go to\r\nhis jagir, which was in Malwa. On the same day I gave an elephant to\r\nKhwaja Abu-l-hasan. On the 9th they brought Khan A`zam, who had come\r\nto Agra from the fort of Gwalior, and who had been sent for. Though\r\nhe had been guilty of many offences, and in all that I had done\r\nto him I was right, yet when they brought him into my presence\r\nand my eye fell on him, I perceived more shame in myself than in\r\nhim. Having pardoned all his offences, I gave him the shawl I had\r\nround my waist. I gave Kunwar Karan 100,000 darab. On the same day\r\nRaja Suraj Singh brought a large elephant of the name of Ran-rawat,\r\nwhich was a celebrated elephant of his, as an offering. In fact,\r\nit was such a rare elephant that I put it into my private stud. On\r\nthe 10th the offering of Khwaja Jahan, which he sent me from Agra\r\nby the hand of his son, was laid before me. It was of all kinds of\r\nthings, of the value of 40,000 rupees. On the 12th the offering of\r\nKhan Dauran, which consisted of forty-five [446] horse two strings\r\nof camels, Arabian dogs (greyhounds), and hunting animals (hawks?),\r\nwas brought before me. On the same day seven other elephants from Raja\r\nSuraj Singh were also brought to me as an offering, and were placed\r\nin my private stud. Tahayyur Khan, after he had been in attendance\r\non me for four months, to-day got leave to go. A message was sent to\r\n`Adil Khan. I impressed on him the profit and loss of friendship and\r\nenmity, and made an agreement (with Tahayyur Khan) that all these\r\nwords should be repeated to `Adil Khan, and he should bring him back\r\nto the path of loyalty and obedience. At the time of his taking leave I\r\nalso bestowed on him certain things. On the whole, in this short time,\r\nwhat with the gifts bestowed on him by me privately, by the princes,\r\nand those given him by the Amirs according to order, the account\r\nmounted up to about 100,000 rupees that he had received. On the 14th\r\nthe rank and reward of my son Khurram were fixed. His mansab had\r\nbeen one of 12,000 personal and 6,000 horse, and that of his brother\r\n(Parwiz) 15,000 personal and 8,000 horse. I ordered his mansab to be\r\nmade equal with that of Parwiz, besides other rewards. I gave him a\r\nprivate elephant of the name of Panchi Gaj, [447] with accoutrements\r\nof the value of 12,000 rupees. On the 16th an elephant was given to\r\nMahabat Khan. On the 17th the mansab of Raja Suraj Singh, which was\r\n4,000 personal and 3,000 horse, was increased by 1,000, and it was\r\nraised to 5,000. At the request of `Abdu-llah Khan the mansab of Khwaja\r\n`Abdu-l-Latif, which was 500 personal and 200 horse, was raised by 200,\r\nand it was ordered to be 1,000 personal and 400 horse. `Abdu-llah,\r\nthe son of Khan A`zam, who was imprisoned in the fort of Rantambhor,\r\nwas sent for at the request of his father. He came to the Court, and\r\nI took the chains off his legs and sent him to his father's house. On\r\nthe 24th, Raja Suraj Singh presented me with another elephant, called\r\nFauj-sangar ('ornament of the army'), by way of offering. Although\r\nthis is also a good elephant, and has been placed in my private stud,\r\nit is not to be compared with the first elephant (he sent), which\r\nis one of the wonders of the age, and is worth 20,000 rupees. On\r\nthe 26th, 200 personal were added to the mansab of Badi`u-z-zaman,\r\nson of Mirza Shahrukh; it was 700 personal and 500 horse. On the\r\nsame day Khwaja Zainu-d-din, who is of the Naqshbandi Khwajas,\r\ncame from Mawara'a-n-nahr and waited on me, bringing as an offering\r\neighteen horses. Qizilbash Khan, who was one of the auxiliaries of\r\nthe province of Gujarat, had come to Court without the leave of the\r\ngovernor. I ordered that an ahadi should put him into confinement,\r\nand that he be sent back to the governor of Gujarat, so that others\r\nmight not desire to do the same. The mansab of Mubarak Khan Sazawal\r\nI raised 500 personal, so that it should be 1,500 personal and 700\r\nhorse. On the 29th I gave Khan A`zam 100,000 rupees, and ordered that\r\nthe parganahs of Dasna [448] and Kasna,1 which are equivalent to 5,000\r\npersonal, should be made his jagir. At the end of the same month I gave\r\nleave to Jahangir Quli Khan, with his brothers and other relatives,\r\nto go to Allahabad, which had been appropriated to them as jagir. At\r\nthis meeting twenty horse, a qaba (parm narm) of Cashmere cloth,\r\ntwelve deer, and ten Arabian dogs were given to Karan. The next day,\r\nwhich was the 1st Khurdad, forty horse, the next day forty-one horse,\r\nand the third day twenty, amounting in the space of three days to\r\n101 head, were given as a present to Kunwar Karan. In return for the\r\nelephant Fauj-sangar, an elephant worth 10,000 rupees out of my private\r\nstud was presented to Raja Suraj Singh. On the 5th of the month ten\r\nturbans (chira), ten coats (qaba), and ten waist-bands were given to\r\nKaran. On the 20th I gave him another elephant.\r\n\r\nIn these days the news-writer of Kashmir had written that a Mulla of\r\nthe name of Gada'i, a disciplined dervish, who for forty years had\r\nlived in one of the monasteries of the city, had prayed the inheritors\r\nof that monastery two years [449] before he was to deliver over the\r\npledge of his life that he might select a corner in that monastery\r\nas a place for his burial. They said, \"Let it be so.\" In short, he\r\nselected a place. When the time for his delivery came he informed his\r\nfriends and relations and those who were dear to him that an order\r\nhad reached him that, delivering over the pledge (of life) he had, he\r\nshould turn towards the last world. Those who were present wondered\r\nat his words, and said that the prophets had no such information,\r\nand how could they believe such words? He said, \"Such an order has\r\nbeen given to me.\" He then turned to one of his confidants, who was\r\nof the sons of the Qazis of the country, and said: \"You will expend\r\nthe price [450] of my Koran, which is worth 700 tankas, in carrying\r\nme (to the grave). When you hear the call to Friday's prayer you\r\nwill enquire for me.\" This conversation took place on the Thursday,\r\nand he divided all the goods in his room among his acquaintance and\r\ndisciples, and went, and at end of the day bathed at the baths. The\r\nQazi-zada aforesaid came before the call for prayer, and enquired\r\nas to the health of the Mulla. When he came to the door of the\r\ncell he found the door closed and a servant sitting there. He asked\r\nthe slave what had happened, and the servant said, \"The Mulla has\r\nenjoined me that until the door of the cell open of its own accord I\r\nmust not go in.\" Shortly after these words were said the door of the\r\ncell opened. The Qazi-zada entered the cell with that servant and saw\r\nthat the Mulla was on his knees with his face turned toward the qibla,\r\nand had given up his soul to God. Happy the state of the freed who can\r\nfly away from this place of the snares of dependence with such ease!\r\n\r\nBy the increase of 200 personal and 50 horse in the mansab of Karam\r\nSen Rathor, I raised it to 1,000 personal and 300 horse. On the\r\n11th of this month the offering of Lashkar Khan, which consisted of\r\nthree strings of Persian camels and twenty cups and plates from Khita\r\n(China) and twenty Arabian dogs, was brought before me. On the 12th\r\na jewelled dagger was bestowed on I`tibar Khan, and to Karan I gave\r\na plume (kalgi) worth 2,000 rupees. On the 14th I gave a dress of\r\nhonour to Sar- [451]buland Ray, and gave him leave to go to the Deccan.\r\n\r\nOn the night of Friday, the 15th, a strange affair occurred. By chance\r\non that night I was at Pushkar. To be brief, Kishan, own brother to\r\nRaja Suraj Singh, was in great perturbation through Gobind Das, the\r\nVakil of the said Raja having some time ago killed his nephew, a youth\r\nof the name of Gopal Das. The cause of the quarrel it would take too\r\nlong to tell. Kishan Singh expected that, as Gopal Das was also the\r\nnephew of the Raja (Suraj Singh), the latter would kill Gobind Das. But\r\nthe Raja, on account of the experience and ability of Gobind Das,\r\nrelinquished the idea of seeking revenge for his nephew's death. When\r\nKishan saw this neglect on the part of the Raja, he resolved himself\r\nto take revenge for his nephew, and not allow his blood to pass away\r\nunnoticed. For a long time he kept this matter in his mind, until on\r\nthat night he assembled his brothers, friends, and servants, and told\r\nthem that he would go that night to take Gobind Das's life, whatever\r\nmight happen, and that he did not care what injury might happen to\r\nthe Raja. The Raja was in ignorance of what was happening, and when\r\nit was near dawn Kishan came with Karan, his brother's son, and other\r\ncompanions. When he arrived at the gate of the Raja's dwelling he\r\nsent some of the experienced men on foot to the house of Gobind Das,\r\nwhich was near the Raja's. He himself (Kishan) was on horseback, and\r\nstationed himself near the gate. The men on foot entered Gobind Das's\r\nhouse, and killed some of those who were there on guard. Whilst this\r\nfight was going on Gobind Das awoke, and seizing his sword in a state\r\nof bewilderment was coming out from one side of the house to join the\r\noutside watchmen. When the men on foot had finished killing some of\r\nthe people, they came out of the tent to endeavour to find out Gobind\r\nDas, and, meeting him, they finished his affair (killed him). Before\r\nthe news of the killing of Gobind Das reached Kishan, he, unable to\r\nbear it any more, dismounted and came inside the dwelling. Although\r\nhis men protested in a disturbed state that it was not right to be on\r\nfoot, he would in no way listen to them. If he had remained a little\r\nlonger and the news of his enemy having been killed had reached him,\r\nit is possible that he would have escaped safe and sound, mounted as\r\nhe was. As the pen of destiny had gone forth after another fashion,\r\nas soon as he alighted and went in, the Raja, who was in his mahall\r\n(female apartment), awoke at the uproar among the people, and stood\r\nat the gate of his house with his sword drawn. People from all sides\r\nwere aroused and came in against the men who were on foot. They saw\r\nwhat the number of men on foot was, and came out in great numbers\r\nand faced Kishan Singh's men, who were about ten in number. In short,\r\nKishan Singh and his nephew Karan, when they reached the Raja's house,\r\nwere attacked by these men and both of them killed. Kishan Singh had\r\nseven and Karan nine wounds. Altogether in this fight 66 men on the\r\ntwo sides were killed, on the Raja's side 30 and on Kishan Singh's\r\n36. When the sun rose and illumined the world with its light, this\r\nbusiness was revealed, and the Raja saw that his brother, his nephew,\r\nand some of his servants, whom he considered dearer than himself,\r\nwere killed, and the whole of the rest had dispersed to their own\r\nplaces. The news reached me in Pushkar, and I ordered them to burn\r\nthose who were killed, according to their rites, and inform me of the\r\ntrue circumstances of the affair. In the end it became clear that the\r\naffair had happened in the manner in which it has been written here,\r\nand that no further enquiry was necessary.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th Miran Sadr Jahan came from his native place and waited on\r\nme with an offering of 100 muhrs. Ray Suraj Singh was dismissed to\r\nhis duty in the Deccan. I presented him with a couple of pearls for\r\nhis ears and a special Kashmir shawl (parm narm). A pair of pearls\r\nwere also sent to Khan Jahan. On the 25th I increased the mansab\r\nof I`tibar Khan by 600 horse, so as to bring it to 5,000 personal\r\nand 2,000 horse. On the same day Karan obtained leave to go to his\r\njagir. He received a present of a horse, a special elephant, a dress\r\nof honour, a string of pearls of the value of 50,000 rupees, and a\r\njewelled dagger which had been completed for 2,000 rupees. From the\r\ntime of his waiting on me till he obtained leave, what he had had\r\nin the shape of cash, jewellery, jewels, and jewelled things was\r\nof the value of 200,000 rupees, with 110 horses, five elephants, in\r\naddition to what my son Khurram bestowed on him at various times. I\r\ngave Mubarak Khan Sazawal a horse and an elephant, and appointed him\r\nto accompany him. I sent several verbal messages to the Rana. Raja\r\nSuraj Singh also obtained leave to go to his native country, with a\r\npromise to return in two months. On the 27th, Payanda Khan Moghul,\r\n[452] who was one of the old Amirs of the State, gave up the deposit\r\nof his life.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this month news came that the ruler of Iran had executed\r\nhis eldest son Safi Mirza. This was a cause of great bewilderment. When\r\nI enquired into it they said that at Darash, [453] which is one of\r\nthe noted cities of Gilan, he ordered a slave of the name of Bihbud\r\nto kill Safi Mirza. The slave found an opportunity, early in the\r\nmorning on the 5th of Muharram, in the year 1024 (25th January,\r\n1615), when the Mirza was returning from the baths towards his\r\nhouse, and finished his affair for him with two wounds from a sword\r\n(sikhaki). [454] After a great part of the day had passed, while his\r\nbody lay between the water and the mud, Shaikh Baha'u-d-din Muhammad,\r\nwho was the best known man in the country for learning and holiness,\r\nand on whom the Shah had full reliance, reported the affair, and,\r\nobtaining leave to lift him up, took his corpse and sent it to Ardabil,\r\nwhere was the burial-ground of his ancestors. Although much enquiry was\r\nmade of travellers from Iran, no one would say a word of this affair\r\nthat satisfied my mind with regard to it. The killing of a son must\r\nhave some powerful motive in order to do away with the disgrace of it.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of the month of Tir I gave an elephant of the name of\r\nRanjit with its trappings to Mirza Rustam and another to Sayyid\r\nAli Barha. Mirak Husain, a relation of Khwaja Shamsu-d-din, was\r\nappointed bakhshi and news-writer of the Subah of Behar, and took\r\nleave to go. I gave Khwaja `Abdu-l-Latif Qush-begi (the falconer) an\r\nelephant and a dress of honour, and dismissed him to his jagir. On\r\nthe 9th of the same month I gave a jewelled sword to Khan Dauran,\r\nand a jewelled dagger was sent for Allahdad, the son of Jalala the\r\nAfghan, who had become loyal. On the 13th took place the meeting for\r\nthe festival of the Ab-pashan [455] (rose-water scattering), and the\r\nservants of the Court amused themselves with sprinkling rose-water\r\nover each other. On the 17th, Amanat Khan was appointed to the port\r\nof Cambay. As Muqarrab Khan proposed to come to Court, the (charge\r\nof the) aforesaid port was changed. On the same day I sent a jewelled\r\nwaist-dagger to my son Parwiz. On the 18th the offering of Khankhanan\r\nwas laid before me. He had prepared all kinds of jewellery and other\r\nthings, jewels with jewelled things, such as three rubies and 103\r\npearls, 100 rubies (yaqut), two jewelled daggers and an aigrette\r\nadorned with rubies and pearls, a jewelled water-jar, a jewelled\r\nsword, a quiver bound with velvet, and a diamond ring, altogether\r\nof the value of about 100,000 rupees, in addition to jewels and\r\njewelled things, cloth from the Deccan and Carnatic, and all kinds\r\nof gilt and plain things, with fifteen elephants and a horse whose\r\nmane reached the ground. The offering of Shah-nawaz Khan (his son)\r\nalso, consisting of five elephants, 300 pieces of all kinds of cloth,\r\nwas brought before me. On the 8th I honoured Hushang with the title\r\nof Ikram Khan. Ruz-afzun, who was one of the princes of the Subah of\r\nBehar and who had been from his youth one of the permanent servants\r\nof the Court, having been honoured by admission into Islam, was made\r\nRaja of the province of his father, Raja Sangram. [456] Though the\r\nlatter had been killed in opposing the leaders of the State, I gave\r\nhim an elephant and leave to go to his native place. An elephant was\r\npresented to Jahangir Quli Khan. On the 24th, Jagat Singh, son of\r\nKunwar Karan, who was in his 12th year, came and waited on me, and\r\npresented petitions from his grandfather, the Rana Amar Singh, and\r\nfrom his father. The signs of nobility and high birth were evident on\r\nhis face. I pleased him with a dress of honour and kindness. To the\r\nmansab of Mirza `Isa Tarkhan an addition of 200 personal was made,\r\nso that it attained to 1,200 personal and 300 horse. In the end\r\nof the month, having honoured Shaikh Husain Rohila with the title\r\nof Mubariz Khan, I dismissed him to his jagir. Ten thousand darabs\r\n(5,000 rupees) were given to the relations of Mirza Sharafu-d-din\r\nHusain Kashghari, who at this time had come and had the honour of\r\nkissing the threshold. On the 5th Amurdad, to the mansab of Raja\r\nNathmal, which was 1,500 personal and 1,100 horse, an addition of\r\n500 personal and 100 horse was made. On the 7th, Kesho (Das) Maru,\r\nwho had a jagir in the Sarkar of Orissa, and who had been sent for to\r\nCourt on account of a complaint [457] against the governor of the Subah\r\nof that place, came and paid his respects. He produced as an offering\r\nfour elephants. As I had a great desire to see my farzand (son) Khan\r\nJahan (Lodi), and for the purpose of enquiring into important matters\r\nconnected with the Deccan, it was necessary for him to come at once,\r\nI sent for him. On Tuesday, the 8th of the same month, he waited on me,\r\nand presented as an offering 1,000 muhrs, 1,000 rupees, 4 rubies, 20\r\npearls, 1 emerald, and a jewelled phul katara, the total value being\r\n50,000 rupees. On the night of Sunday, as it was the anniversary of\r\nthe great Khwaja (Mu`inu-d-din), I went to his revered mausoleum,\r\nand remained there till midnight. The attendants and Sufis exhibited\r\necstatic states, and I gave the fakirs and attendants money with\r\nmy own hand; altogether there were expended 6,000 rupees in cash,\r\n100 saub-kurta (a robe down to the ankles), 70 rosaries of pearls,\r\n[458] coral and amber, etc. Maha Singh, grandson of Raja Man Singh,\r\nwas honoured with the title of Raja, and a standard and drums given\r\nhim. On the 16th an Iraq horse out of my private stable and another\r\nhorse were presented to Mahabat Khan. On the 19th an elephant was\r\ngiven to Khan A`zam. On the 20th, 200 horse were added to the mansab\r\nof Kesho (Das) Maru, which was 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse, and\r\nhe was dignified with a dress of honour. An increase of 200 personal\r\nand horse was made to the mansab of Khwaja `Aqil, which was 1,200\r\npersonal and 600 horse. On the 22nd, Mirza Raja Bhao Singh took leave\r\nto go to Amber, which was his ancient native place, and had given him\r\na special Kashmir phup (?) robe. [459] On the 25th, Ahmad Beg Khan,\r\nwho was imprisoned at Rantambhor, paid his respects to me, and his\r\noffences were pardoned on account of his former services. On the 28th,\r\nMuqarrab Khan came from the Subah of Gujarat and waited on me, and\r\noffered an aigrette and a jewelled throne. [460] An increase of 500\r\npersonal and horse was made to the mansab of Salaamu-llah, the Arab,\r\nand it was brought to 2,000 personal and 1,100 horse. On the 1st of the\r\nmonth of Shahriwar the following increases were made in the rank of\r\na number of men who were going on service to the Deccan:--To Mubariz\r\nKhan 300 horse, making 1,000 personal and horse. Nahir Khan was also\r\nraised to 1,000 personal and horse. Dilawar Khan was raised by 300\r\nhorse to 2,500 personal and horse. Mangli Khan's rank was increased\r\nby 200 horse to 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse. Girdhar, the son of\r\nRay Sal, had the rank of 800 personal and horse bestowed on him, and\r\nIlf Khan Qiyam Khan the same mansab, original and increase. Yadgar\r\nHusain was raised to 700 personal and 500 horse, and Kamalu-d-din,\r\nson of Shir Khan, to the same mansab. One hundred and fifty horse were\r\nadded to the rank of Sayyid `Abdu-llah Barha, which then came to 700\r\npersonal and 300 horse, original and increase. On the 8th of the said\r\nmonth I bestowed one Nur-jahani muhr, which is equal to 6,400 rupees,\r\non Mustafa Beg, the ambassador of the ruler of Iran, and presented\r\nfive cheetahs to Qasim Khan, governor of Bengal. Mirza Murad, eldest\r\nson of Mirza Rustam, on the 12th of the same month was honoured with\r\nthe title of Iltifat Khan. On the night of the 16th, corresponding with\r\nthe Shab-i-barat (consecrated to the memory of forefathers), I ordered\r\nthem to light lamps on the hills round the Ana Sagar tank and on its\r\nbanks, and went myself to look at them. The reflection of the lamps\r\nfell on the water and had a wonderful appearance. I passed the most\r\nof that night with the ladies of the mahall on the bank of that tank.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th, Mirza Jamalu-d-din Husain, [461] who had gone as an\r\nambassador to Bijapur, came and waited on me, and presented three\r\nrings, the stone of one of which was a cornelian from Yemen, of\r\ngreat beauty and pureness of water, the like of which is seldom\r\nseen among the cornelians of Yemen. `Adil Khan sent a person of\r\nthe name of Sayyid Kabir Khan on his own part with the said Mir,\r\nand forwarded as offerings elephants with gold and silver fittings,\r\nArab horses, jewels and jewelled things, and all kinds of cloth made\r\nin that country. On the 24th of this month they were brought before\r\nme with a letter he had brought. On the same day the assembly for my\r\nsolar weighing was held. On the 26th, Mustafa Beg, the ambassador,\r\ntook his leave. In addition to what had been bestowed on him during\r\nthe time of his attendance, I gave him 20,000 rupees more in cash\r\nand a dress of honour, and in answer to the letter he had brought\r\nsent a friendly letter written in the perfection of friendship. On\r\nthe 4th of the month of Mihr the mansab of Mir Jamalu-d-din Husain,\r\nwhich was 2,000 personal and 500 horse, was fixed at 4,000 personal\r\nand 2,000 horse. On the 5th, Mahabat Khan, in company with Khan\r\nJahan, who had been appointed to serve in the Deccan, at the hour\r\nthat had been appointed for him, took his leave; he was honoured\r\nwith a dress of honour, a jewelled dagger, a phul katara, a special\r\nsword, and an elephant. On the 8th, Khan Jahan took his leave, and I\r\npresented him with a dress of honour, and a special nadiri (a dress),\r\nand an ambling horse with a saddle, a special elephant, and a special\r\nsword. On the same date 1,700 horse of those under the command of\r\nMahabat Khan were ordered to have assignments (tankhwah) for two or\r\nthree horses given them. The whole of the men who were at this time\r\nappointed for service in the Deccan were 330 mansabdars, 3,000 ahadis,\r\n700 horse from the Uymaqs, and 3,000 Dalazak Afghans. Altogether\r\nthere were 30,000 [462] cavalry, and 3,000,000 rupees of treasure,\r\nand an efficient artillery, and war elephants. They proceeded on this\r\nduty. The mansab of Sarbuland Ray was increased by 500 personal and\r\n260 horse, and came to 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse. Balju, nephew of\r\nQilij Khan, was promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 700 horse,\r\noriginal and increase. I also increased Raja Kishan Das's mansab by\r\n500. At the request of Khan Jahan, the mansab of Shahbaz Khan Lodi,\r\nwho belonged to the Deccan force, was fixed, original and increase,\r\nat 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse; and 200 horse were added to the\r\nmansab of Wazir Khan. The mansab of Suhrab Khan, son of Mirza Rustam,\r\nwas fixed at 1,000 personal and 400 horse, original and increase. On\r\nthe 14th of the same month 1,000 was added to the mansab of Mir\r\nJamalu-d-din Husain, and by increasing it also by 500 horse he was\r\nraised to the exalted rank of 5,000 personal and 2,500 horse. On the\r\n19th, Raja Suraj Singh, with his son Gaj Singh, who had gone home,\r\ncame and paid their respects, and presented as offerings 100 muhrs and\r\n1,000 rupees. I gave Sayyid Kabir, who had been sent by `Adil Khan,\r\none Nurjahani muhr, which weighed 500 tulcha. On the 23rd, ninety\r\nelephants of those which Qasim Khan had acquired from the conquest\r\nof the country of Kuch (Behar), and the conquest of the Maghs and the\r\nzamindars of Orissa, were brought before me and placed in the special\r\nelephant houses. On the 26th, Iradat Khan was raised to the rank of\r\nMir-samani (head butler), Mu`tamad Khan to that of Bakhshi of the\r\nAhadis, Muhammad Riza Jabiri to that of Bakhshi of the Subah of the\r\nPanjab and news writer of that place. Sayyid Kabir, who had come on\r\nthe part of `Adil Khan to beg pardon for the offences of the rulers\r\n(dunya-daran) of the Deccan, and to promise the restoration of the\r\nfort of Ahmadnagar and the royal territory which had been taken out\r\nof the possession of the chiefs of the victorious State through the\r\nrebellion of certain rebels, came and waited on me, and obtained\r\nleave to go on this date; and, having received a dress of honour,\r\nan elephant, and a horse, started off. As Raja Raj Singh Kachhwaha\r\nhad died in the Deccan, I promoted his son Ram Das to the mansab of\r\n1,000 personal and 400 horse. On the 4th of Aban, drums were given\r\nto Saif Khan Barha and his mansab increased by 300 horse, so as to\r\nbring it up to 3,000 personal and 2,000 horse. On the same date I\r\nreleased Raja Man, who was in confinement in the fort of Gwalior,\r\non the security of Murtaza Khan, and, confirming his mansab, sent\r\nhim to the said Khan for duty at the fort of Kangra. At the request\r\nof Khan Dauran, an increase of 300 horse was ordered to the mansab\r\nof Sadiq Khan, raising it to 1,000 personal and horse. Mirza `Isa\r\nTarkhan came from the province of Sambhal, which was his jagir, and\r\nwaited on me, and offered 100 muhrs. On the 16th, Raja Suraj Singh\r\nobtained leave to go to his duty in the Deccan, and I increased his\r\nmansab by 300 horse, so as to make it 5,000 personal and 3,300 horse;\r\nhe received a dress of honour and a horse, and started. On the 18th\r\nI confirmed the mansab of Mirza `Isa, original and increase, at 1,500\r\npersonal and 800 horse, and gave him an elephant and a dress of honour,\r\nand he took leave to go to the Deccan.\r\n\r\nOn the same day the news of the death of the wretch Chin Qilij was\r\nreceived by a letter from Jahangir Quli Khan. After the death of Qilij\r\nKhan, who was one of the old servants of this State, I had made this\r\ninauspicious man an Amir, and shown him great favour, and given him\r\nin jagir such a place as Jaunpur. I also sent his other brothers and\r\nrelations with him and made them his deputies. He had one brother of\r\nthe name of Lahori, [463] of a very wicked disposition. It was reported\r\nto me that the servants of God (people) were greatly oppressed by his\r\nconduct. I sent an ahadi to bring him (Lahori) from Jaunpur. At the\r\ncoming of the ahadi, suspicion without any cause prevailed over Chin\r\nQilij, and it came into his mind to run away, taking his misguided\r\nbrother with him. Leaving his mansab, his government, place, and jagir,\r\nmoney, property, children, and people, he took a little money and gold\r\nand a few jewels and went with a small body among the zamindars. This\r\nnews arrived a few days ago and caused great astonishment. In short,\r\nto whatever zamindar he went he took money [464] from him(?) and then\r\nlet him go(?), until news came that he had entered the country of\r\nJohat. [465] When this news reached Jahangir Quli Khan, he sent some\r\nof his men to take and bring that thoughtless one. They took him as\r\nsoon as they arrived, and were intending to take him to Jahangir Quli\r\nKhan, when he at that very moment went to hell. Some of those who had\r\naccompanied him said that for some days previously he had contracted\r\nan illness and it had killed him. But this was heard of him as well,\r\nthat he committed suicide, in order that they might not take him to\r\nJahangir Quli Khan in this state. In any case, they brought his body\r\nwith his children and servants who were with him to Allahabad. They\r\nmade away with most of the money that he had, and the zamindars took\r\nit from him. Alas, that salt (i.e. loyalty) should not have brought\r\nsuch black-faced wretches to condign punishment!\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Behind the duty that lies on all people is the duty to the\r\n    sovereign and benefactor\"(?). [466]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd, at the request of Khan Dauran, 200 horse were added to the\r\nmansab of Nad `Ali Maidani, one of the officers appointed to Bangash,\r\nwhich brought it to 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse; 100 horse were\r\nalso added to the mansab of Lashkar Khan, which was 2,000 personal\r\nand 900 horse. On the 24th I confirmed the mansab of Muqarrab Khan,\r\nwhich was 3,000 personal and 2,000 horse, and increased it to 5,000\r\npersonal and 2,500 horse. On the same day I bestowed the title of Khan\r\non Qiyam, son of Shah Muhammad Qandahari, who was an Amir-zada, and was\r\nin service as a huntsman. On the 5th of the month of Azar a jewelled\r\ndagger was given to Darab Khan, and by the hand of Raja Sarang Deo\r\ndresses of honour were bestowed on the Amirs of the Deccan. As some\r\n(evil) things had been heard about Safdar Khan, governor of Kashmir,\r\nI dismissed him from the government, and favouring Ahmad Beg Khan\r\non account of his previous services, I promoted him to be Subadar of\r\nKashmir, and confirmed his mansab of 2,500 personal and 1,500 horse,\r\nhonoured him with a jewelled waist-dagger and a dress of honour, and\r\ngave him leave. By the hand of Ihtimam Khan I sent winter dresses of\r\nhonour to Qasim Khan, governor of Bengal, and the Amirs that were\r\nattached to that province. On the 15th of the month there was laid\r\nbefore me the offering of Maka'i, son of Iftikhar Khan, consisting of\r\nan elephant, got [467] horses, and pieces of cloth. He was honoured\r\nwith the title of Muruwwat Khan. At the request of I`timadu-d-daula,\r\nI had sent for Dayanat Khan, who was in the fort of Gwalior, and he\r\nhad the good fortune to pay his respects; his property, which had\r\nbeen confiscated, was restored to him.\r\n\r\nAt this time Khwaja Hashim, of Dahbid, who at this day vigorously\r\nmaintains in Transoxiana the profession of a dervish, and in whom\r\nthe people of that country have great belief, sent a letter by the\r\nhand of one of his disciples pointing out his old devotion (to the\r\nroyal family) and connection and friendship of his ancestors with\r\nthis illustrious family, together with a farji [468] and a bow and a\r\ncouplet which the late king Babar had made for a saint of the name\r\nof Khwajagi, who also belonged to that sect of dervishes. The last\r\nhemistich is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"We are bound to the Khwajagi and are servants to the Khwajagi.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI also with my own pen wrote some lines in the style of that writing,\r\nand sent impromptu quatrains with 1,000 Jahangiri muhrs to the said\r\nKhwaja--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"O thou whose kindness to me is ever more and more,\r\n    The State has remembrance of thee, O Dervish,\r\n    As from good tidings our heart is rejoiced,\r\n    We are glad that thy kindness passes all bounds.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I ordered that whoever had the poetic temperament should recite\r\n(compose?) this quatrain, [469] Hakim Masihu-z-zaman said, and said\r\nvery well--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Although we have the business of kingship before us,\r\n    Every moment more and more we think on the dervishes.\r\n    If the heart of our Dervish be gladdened by us\r\n    We count that to be the profit of our kingship.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI gave the Hakim 1,000 muhrs for the composition of this quatrain. On\r\nthe 7th of the month of Day, when I was coming back from Pushkar and\r\nreturning to Ajmir, on the way forty-two wild pigs were taken.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th, Mir Miran came and waited on me. A summary of his\r\ncircumstances and of his family is now written. On the side of his\r\nfather [470] he is the grandson of Mir Ghiyasu-d-din Muhammad Mir\r\nMiran, son of Shah Ni`matu-llah Wali. During the reigns of the Safawi\r\nkings the family had attained to great respect, so that Shah Tahmasp\r\ngave his own sister Janish [471] Khanim to Shah Ni`matu-llah, and so\r\non account of his being a great Shaikh and of his being an instructor\r\nhe was made a relative and a son-in-law (of kings). On the side of his\r\nmother he was the daughter's son of Shah Isma`il Khuni (Isma`il II, the\r\nBloody). After the death of Shah Ni`matu-llah, his son Ghiyasu-d-din\r\nMuhammad Mir Miran received great consideration, and the late Shah\r\n(Tahmasp) gave to his eldest son in marriage a daughter from the royal\r\nfamily. He gave the daughter of the above-mentioned Shah Isma`il to\r\nanother son of his, Khalilu-llah, to whom Mir Miran was born. The\r\naforesaid Mir Khalilu-llah, seven or eight years before this, had come\r\nfrom Persia and waited on me at Lahore. As he belonged to a high and\r\nsaintly family, I was much interested in his affairs, and gave him a\r\nmansab and a jagir, and honoured and cherished him. After the seat of\r\ngovernment was at Agra, in a short time he was attacked by bilious\r\n[472] diarrhoea from eating too many mangoes, and in ten or twelve\r\ndays gave up his soul to the Creator. I was grieved at his going,\r\nand ordered what he had left in cash and jewels to be sent to his\r\nchildren in Persia. Meanwhile Mir Miran, who was 22 years old, became\r\na qalandar and dervish, and came to me at Ajmir in a way that nobody\r\non the road could recognize him. I soothed all the troubles of his\r\nmind and the miseries of his inward and outward condition, and gave\r\nhim a mansab of 1,000 personal and 400 horse, and presented him with\r\n30,000 darabs in cash. He is now in waiting and attendance on me.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th, Zafar Khan, who had been removed from the Subah of Behar,\r\ncame and waited on me, and made an offering of 100 muhrs, as well as\r\nthree elephants. On the 15th of Day I increased the mansab of Qasim\r\nKhan, the Subahdar of Bengal, by 1,000 personal and horse, so as to\r\nmake it 4,000 personal and horse. As the diwan and bakhshi of Bengal,\r\nHusain Beg and Tahir, had not done approved service, Mukhlis Khan,\r\nwho was one of the confidential servants of the Court, was nominated\r\nto these duties. I conferred on him a mansab of 2,000 personal and\r\n700 horse, and also gave him a standard. The duty of `arz-mukarrir\r\n(reviser of petitions) I ordered to be given to Dayanat Khan. On the\r\n25th, Friday, the weighing of my son Khurram took place. Up to the\r\npresent year, when he is 24 years old, and is married and has children,\r\nhe has never defiled himself with drinking wine. On this day, when the\r\nassembly for his weighing was held, I said to him: \"Baba, thou hast\r\nbecome the father of children, and kings and kings' sons have drunk\r\nwine. To-day, which is the day of thy being weighed, I will give thee\r\nwine to drink, and give thee leave to drink it on feast days and at\r\nthe time of the New Year, and at all great festivals. But thou must\r\nobserve the path of moderation, for wise men do not consider it right\r\nto drink to such an extent as to destroy the understanding, and it is\r\nnecessary that from drinking only profit should be derived.\" Bu `Ali\r\n(Avicenna), who is one of the most learned of hakims and physicians,\r\nhas written this quatrain--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Wine is a raging enemy, a prudent friend;\r\n    A little is an antidote, but much a snake's poison.\r\n    In much there is no little injury,\r\n    In a little there is much profit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWith much trouble wine was given to him. I had not drunk it till I\r\nwas 15 [473] years old, except when in the time of my infancy two\r\nor three times my mother and wet-nurses gave it by way of infantile\r\nremedy. They asked for a little spirit from my revered father, and\r\ngave it me to the extent of a tola mixed with water and rosewater to\r\ntake away a cough, designating it as medicine. At the time when the\r\ncamp of my revered father had been pitched in order to put down the\r\ndisturbance of Yusufza'e Afghans at the fort of Attock, which is on\r\nthe bank of the Nilab (Indus) River, one day I had mounted to go out\r\nto hunt. When I had moved about a good deal and the signs of weariness\r\nhad set in, a gunner of the name of Ustad Shah-quli, a wonderful gunner\r\nout of those under my revered uncle Mirza Muhammad Hakim, said to me\r\nthat if I would take a cup of wine it would drive away the feeling of\r\nbeing tired and heavy. It was in the time of my youth, and as I felt\r\ndisposed towards it I ordered Mahmud, the Ab-dar (person in charge of\r\ndrinking water, etc.), to go to the house of Hakim `Ali and bring me\r\nan intoxicating draught. He sent me [474] the amount of one and a half\r\ncups of yellow wine of a sweet taste in a little bottle. I drank it,\r\nand found its quality agreeable. After that I took to drinking wine,\r\nand increased it from day to day until wine made from grapes ceased to\r\nintoxicate me, and I took to drinking arrack (`araq, spirits), and by\r\ndegrees during nine years my potions rose to twenty cups of doubly\r\ndistilled spirits, fourteen during the daytime and the remainder\r\nat night. The weight of this was six Hindustani sirs or one and a\r\nhalf maunds of Iran. The extent of my eating in those days was a fowl\r\n[475] with bread and vegetables (lit. radish). [476] In that state of\r\nmatters no one had the power to forbid me, and matters went to such a\r\nlength that in the crapulous state from the excessive trembling of my\r\nhand I could not drink from my own cup, but others had to give it me\r\nto drink, until I sent for Hakim Humam, brother of Hakim Abu-l-fath,\r\nwho was of the most intimate with my revered father, and informed him\r\nof my state. He, with excessive sincerity and unfeigned burning of\r\nheart, said to me without hesitation, \"Lord of the world, by the way\r\nin which you drink spirits, God forbid it, but in six months matters\r\nwill come to such a pass that there will be no remedy for it.\" As his\r\nwords were said out of pure good-will, and sweet life was dear to me,\r\nthey made an impression on me, and from that day I began to lessen\r\nmy allowance and set myself to take filuniya. [477] In proportion as\r\nI diminished my liquor, I increased the amount of filuniya.\r\n\r\nI also ordered that the arrack should be diluted with wine of the grape\r\nso that there should be two parts wine and one part arrack. Every\r\nday I diminished the quantity I took, and in the course of seven\r\nyears I brought it down to six cups. The weight of each cupful was 18\r\n1/4 misqals. It is now fifteen years that I have drunk at this rate,\r\nneither more nor less. And my drinking time is the night except on the\r\nday of Thursdays, as it is the day of the blessed accession. Also on\r\nthe eve [478] of Friday, which is the most blessed eve of the week,\r\nand is the prelude to a blessed day (I do not drink). I drink at\r\nthe end of each day with these two [479] exceptions, for it does not\r\nappear right that this eve (Thursday night) should be spent in neglect,\r\nand that there should be an omission (on Friday) of returning thanks\r\nto the True Benefactor. On the day of Thursday and on the day of\r\nSunday I do not eat meat. Not on Thursday, because it is the day\r\nof my auspicious accession, and not on Sunday, because it is the\r\nbirthday of my revered father, and he greatly honoured and held dear\r\nthe day. After some time I substituted opium for filuniya. Now that\r\nmy age has arrived at 46 solar years and 4 months, I eat eight surkhs\r\n(a red berry used as a weight) of opium when five gharis of day have\r\npassed, and six surkhs after one watch of night.\r\n\r\nI gave a jewelled dagger to `Abdu-llah Khan by the hand of Maqsud\r\n`Ali. Shaikh Musa, a relation of Qasim Khan, was dignified with the\r\ntitle of Khan, and promoted to the mansab of 800 personal and 400\r\nhorse, and was allowed to go to Bengal. The mansab of Zafar Khan was\r\nincreased to 500 personal and horse, and he was appointed to duty in\r\nBangash. On the same day Muhammad Husain, brother of Khwaja Jahan,\r\nwas given the faujdarship of the Sarkar of Hissar and dismissed, his\r\nmansab being increased by 200 horse to raise it to 500 personal and\r\n400 horse, with the gift of an elephant. On the 5th Bahman an elephant\r\nwas conferred on Mir Miran. When the merchant `Abdu-l-Karim left Iran\r\nfor Hindustan, my exalted brother Shah `Abbas sent me by his hand\r\na rosary of cornelian from Yemen and a cup of Venetian workmanship,\r\nwhich was very fine and rare. On the 9th of the same month they were\r\nlaid before me. On the 18th some offerings of many kinds of jewelled\r\nornaments, etc., which Sultan Parwiz had sent to me, were laid before\r\nme. On the 7th Isfandarmuz, Sadiq, nephew of I`timadu-d-daulah, who was\r\npermanently employed as Bakhshi, was honoured with the title of Khan. I\r\nhad also conferred this title on Khwaja `Abdu-l-`Aziz. According to\r\nwhat was right, I called him by the title of `Abdu-l-`Aziz Khan and\r\nSadiq by that of Sadiq Khan. On the 10th, Jagat Singh, son of Kunwar\r\nKaran, who had obtained leave to go to his native country, when he\r\ntook leave was presented with 20,000 rupees, a horse, an elephant, a\r\ndress of honour, and a special shawl. Five thousand rupees, a horse,\r\nand a dress of honour were also given to Haridas Jhala, who was one\r\nof the confidants of the Rana and tutor to Karan's son. By his hand\r\nI also sent a mace of gold (shashpari) for the Rana.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of the same month, Raja Suraj Singh, son of Raja Baso,\r\nwho on account of the nearness of his dwelling-place to it had been\r\nsent with Murtaza Khan to capture the fort of Kangra, came on my\r\nsummons and waited on me. The aforesaid Khan had entertained certain\r\nsuspicions with regard to him, and on this account, considering him\r\nan undesirable companion, had repeatedly sent petitions to the Court,\r\nand wrote things about him until an order was received to summon him.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th, Nizamu-d-din Khan came from Multan and waited on me. In\r\nthe end of this year news of victory and prosperity came in from all\r\nsides of my dominions. In the first place, this was with regard to\r\nthe disturbance of Ahdad, the Afghan, who for a long time past had\r\nbeen in rebellion in the hill country of Kabul, and round whom many\r\nof the Afghans of that neighbourhood had assembled, and against whom\r\nfrom the time of my revered father until now, which is the 10th year\r\nafter my accession, armies have always been employed. He by degrees was\r\ndefeated, and, falling into a wretched state, a part of his band was\r\ndispersed and a part killed. He took refuge for some time in Charkh,\r\nwhich was a place on which he relied, but Khan Dauran surrounded\r\nit and closed the road for entry and exit. When there remained no\r\ngrass for his beasts or means of living for men in the fortress,\r\nhe at night brought down his animals from the hills and grazed them\r\non the skirts, and accompanied them himself, in order that he might\r\nset an example to his men. At last this intelligence reached Khan\r\nDauran. He then appointed a body of his leaders and experienced\r\nmen to go into ambush on an appointed night in the neighbourhood of\r\nCharkh. That band went and hid itself at night in places of refuge,\r\nand Khan Dauran rode on the same day in that direction. When those\r\nill-fated ones brought out their cattle and let them loose to graze,\r\nand the ill-conditioned Ahdad himself passed by the places of ambush\r\nwith his own band, suddenly a dust rose in front of him. When they\r\nenquired it became known that it was Khan Dauran. In a state of\r\nbewilderment he endeavoured to turn back, and the scouts announced\r\nto the aforesaid Khan that it was Ahdad. The Khan gave his horse the\r\nreins and went at Ahdad; the men who were in ambush also blocked the\r\nroad and attacked him. The fight lasted till midday in consequence of\r\nthe broken nature of the ground and the thickness of the jungle; at\r\nlast defeat fell on the Afghans and they betook themselves to the hill:\r\nabout 300 fighting men went to hell and 100 were taken prisoners. Ahdad\r\ncould not regain the stronghold and hold on there. Necessarily he\r\nturned his face towards Qandahar. The victorious troops entering\r\nCharkh, burnt all the places and houses of those ill-fortuned ones,\r\nand destroyed and rooted them up from their foundations.\r\n\r\nAnother [480] piece of news was the defeat of the ill-starred `Ambar\r\nand the destruction of his unfortunate army. Briefly, a band of the\r\ninfluential leaders and a body of Bargis (Mahrattas), who are a hardy\r\nlot and who are the centre of resistance in that country, becoming\r\nangry with `Ambar, showed an intention to be loyal, and begging for\r\nquarter from Shah-nawaz Khan, who was in Balapur with an army of royal\r\ntroops, agreed to interview the said Khan, and being satisfied, Adam\r\nKhan, Yaqut Khan, and other leaders, and the Bargis Jado [481] Ray\r\nand Bapu Katiya, came and interviewed him. Shah-nawaz Khan gave each\r\nof them a horse, an elephant, money, and dress of honour, according\r\nto their quality and condition, made them hot in duty and loyalty,\r\nand marching from Balapur started against the rebel `Ambar in their\r\ncompany. On the road they fell in with an army of the Dakhanis, whose\r\nleaders were Mahalldar, [482] Danish (Atash?), Dilawar, Bijli, Firuz,\r\nand others, and routed it.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"With broken arms and loosened loins,\r\n    No strength in their feet, no sense in their heads.\" [483]\r\n\r\n\r\nThey reached the camp of that ill-starred one, and he from excessive\r\npride determined to fight with the victorious troops. Having collected\r\nthose rebels who were with him and `Adil Khan's army and that of\r\nQutbu-l-mulk together, and preparing their artillery, he started\r\nto meet the royal troops until a space of not more than 5 or 6 kos\r\nremained between. On Sunday, the 25th Bahman, the armies of light and\r\ndarkness approached each other and the scouts became visible. Three\r\nwatches of day had passed when cannon and rocket firing began. In\r\nthe end Darab Khan, who was in command of the vanguard, with other\r\nleaders and zealous men such as Raja Bir Singh Deo, Ray Chand,\r\n`Ali Khan the Tatar, Jahangir Quli Beg Turkman, and other lions of\r\nthe forest of bravery, drew their swords and charged the vanguard\r\nof the enemy. Performing the dues of manliness and bravery, they\r\nscattered this army like the Banatu-n-na`sh ('Daughters of the Bier,'\r\ni.e. the Great Bear); and not stopping there they attacked the enemy's\r\ncentre. Turning on the army opposed to them, such a hand-to-hand\r\nstruggle took place that the onlookers remained bewildered. For nearly\r\ntwo gharis this combat went on. Heaps of the dead lay there, and the\r\nill-starred `Ambar, unable to offer further opposition, turned his\r\nface to flight. If darkness [484] and gloom had not come on at the\r\ncry of those black-fortuned ones, not one of them would have found\r\nthe road to the valley of safety. The crocodiles of the river of\r\nconflict followed the fugitives for 2 or 3 kos. When horses and men\r\ncould move no more and the defeated were scattered, they drew rein\r\nand returned to their places. The whole of the enemy's artillery,\r\nwith 300 laden camels that carried rockets, war elephants, Arab and\r\nPersian horses, weapons and armour beyond reckoning, fell into the\r\nhands of the servants of the State, and there was no counting the\r\nslain and the fallen. A great many of the leaders fell alive into their\r\nhands. The next day the victorious troops, marching from the place of\r\nvictory, proceeded to Karki, which was the nest of those owlish ones,\r\nand seeing no trace of them they encamped there, and obtained news\r\nthat they during that night and day had fallen miserably in different\r\nplaces. For some days the victorious army, delayed at Karki, levelled\r\nwith the dark earth the buildings and houses of the enemy, and burnt\r\nthat populous place. In consequence of the occurrence of certain\r\nevents, to describe which in detail would take too long here, they\r\nreturned from that place and descended by the Rohan Khanda Pass. In\r\nreward for this service I ordered increases to be made in the mansabs\r\nof a number who had shown zeal and bravery.\r\n\r\nThe third piece of news was the conquest of the province of Khokhara\r\n[485] and the acquisition of the diamond mines, which were taken by\r\nthe excellent exertions of Ibrahim Khan. This province is one of the\r\ndependencies of the Subah of Behar and Patna. There is a river there\r\nfrom which they procure diamonds. At the season when there is little\r\nwater, there are pools and water-holes, and it has become known by\r\nexperience to those who are employed in this work that above every\r\nwater-hole in which there are diamonds, there are crowds of flying\r\nanimals of the nature of gnats, and which in the language of India\r\nthey call jhinga(?). [486] Keeping the bed of the stream in sight as\r\nfar as it is accessible, they make a collection of stones (sangchin)\r\nround the water-holes. After this they empty the water-holes with\r\nspades and shovels to the extent of a yard or 1 1/2 yards and dig\r\nup the area. They find among the stones and sand large and small\r\ndiamonds [487] and bring them out. It occasionally happens that they\r\nfind a piece of diamond worth 100,000 rupees. Briefly, this province\r\nand this river were in possession of a Hindu Zamindar of the name\r\nof Durjan Sal, and although the governors of the Subah frequently\r\nsent armies against him and went there themselves, in consequence\r\nof the difficult roads and thickness of the jungles they contented\r\nthemselves with taking two or three diamonds and left him in his former\r\ncondition. When the aforesaid Subah was transferred from Zafar Khan,\r\nand Ibrahim Khan was appointed in his place, at the time of his taking\r\nleave I ordered him to go and take the province out of the possession\r\nof that unknown and insignificant individual. As soon as he arrived\r\nin the province of Behar he assembled a force and went against that\r\nZamindar. According to former custom he sent some of his men with a\r\npromise to give some diamonds and some elephants, but the Khan did\r\nnot agree to this and entered impetuously into the province. Before\r\nthe fellow could collect his men he found guides and invaded it. Just\r\nwhen the zamindar received this news, the hills and vales that are his\r\nabode were beleaguered. Ibrahim sent men about to find him and they got\r\nhold of him in a cave with several women, one of whom was his mother,\r\nwhile others were also his father's wives. They arrested him, and also\r\none of his brothers. They searched and took from them the diamonds\r\nthey had with them. Twenty-three male and female elephants also fell\r\ninto Ibrahim's hands. In reward for this service the mansab of Ibrahim\r\nKhan original and increase, was made up to 4,000 personal and horse,\r\nand he was exalted with the title of Fath-jang. Orders were also given\r\nfor an increase in the mansabs of those who accompanied him on this\r\nservice and had shown bravery. That province is now in possession of\r\nthe imperial servants of the State. They carry on work in the bed of\r\nthe stream, and bring to Court whatever diamonds are found. A large\r\ndiamond, the value of which has been estimated at 50,000 rupees,\r\nhas lately been brought from there. If a little pains are taken,\r\nit is probable that good diamonds will be found and be placed in\r\nthe jewel-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELEVENTH NEW YEAR'S FEAST AFTER THE AUSPICIOUS ACCESSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nFifteen gharis of day had passed on Sunday, the last day of\r\nIsfandarmuz, corresponding with the 1st Rabi`u-l-awwal (19th\r\nMarch, 1616), when from the mansion of Pisces the sun cast the\r\nray of prosperity on the palace of Aries. At this auspicious\r\nhour, having performed the dues of service and supplication at\r\nthe throne of Almighty God, I ascended the throne of State in the\r\npublic audience hall, the area of which was laid out with tents and\r\ncanopies (shamiyanaha), and its sides adorned with European screens,\r\npainted gold brocades, and rare cloths. The princes, Amirs, the\r\nchief courtiers, the ministers of State, and all the servants of the\r\nCourt performed their congratulatory salutations. As Hafiz Nad `Ali,\r\nguyanda (singer), was one of the ancient servants, I ordered that\r\nwhatever offerings were made on the Monday by anyone in the shape of\r\ncash or goods should be given to him by way of reward. On the 2nd\r\nday (of Farwardin) the offerings of some of the employés were laid\r\nbefore me. On the 4th day the offering of Khwaja Jahan, who had sent\r\nthem from Agra, and which consisted of several diamonds and pearls,\r\nof jewelled things, cloth stuffs of all kinds, and an elephant,\r\nworth altogether 50,000 rupees, was brought before me. On the 5th\r\nday, Kunwar Karan, who had been given leave to go to his home,\r\nreturned and waited on me. He presented as offering 100 muhrs,\r\n1,000 rupees, an elephant with fittings, and four horses. To the\r\nmansab of Asaf Khan, which was 4,000 personal and 2,000 horse,\r\nI on the 7th made an addition of 1,000 personal and 2,000 horse,\r\nand honoured him with drums and a standard. On this day the offering\r\nof Mir Jamalu-d-din Husain was laid before me; what he offered was\r\napproved and accepted. Among the things was a jewelled dagger which\r\nhad been made under his superintendence. [488] On its hilt was a\r\nyellow ruby [489] (yaqut-i-zard), exceeding clear and bright, in\r\nsize equal to half a hen's egg. I had never before seen so large and\r\nbeautiful a yellow ruby. Along with it were other rubies of approved\r\ncolour and old emeralds. Brokers (muqiman) valued it (the dagger)\r\nat 50,000 rupees. I increased the mansab of the said Mir by 1,000\r\nhorse, which brought it to 5,000 personal and 3,500 horse. On the\r\n8th I increased the mansab of Sadiq Haziq by 300 personal and horse,\r\nand that of Iradat Khan by 300 personal and 200 horse, so as to\r\nraise each to 1,000 personal and 500 horse. On the 9th the offering\r\nof Khwaja Abu-l-hasan was laid before me; of jewelled ornaments and\r\ncloth stuffs, what was of the value of 40,000 rupees was accepted,\r\nand the remainder I made a present to him. The offering of Tatar Khan\r\nBakawul-begi, consisting of one ruby (la`l), one yaqut, a jewelled\r\ntakhti (signet?), two rings, and some cloths, was accepted. On the\r\n10th three elephants which Raja Maha Singh sent from the Deccan,\r\nand 100 and odd pieces of gold brocade, etc., which Murtaza Khan sent\r\nfrom Lahore, were laid before me. On this date Dayanat Khan presented\r\nhis offering of two pearl rosaries, two rubies, six large pearls, and\r\none gold tray, to the value of 28,000 rupees. At the end of Thursday,\r\nthe 11th, I went to the house of I`timadu-d-daulah in order to add to\r\nhis dignity. He then presented me with his offering, and I examined it\r\nin detail. Much of it was exceedingly rare. Of jewels there were two\r\npearls worth 30,000 rupees, one qutbi ruby which had been purchased for\r\n22,000 rupees, with other pearls and rubies. Altogether the value was\r\n110,000 rupees. These had the honour of acceptance, and of cloth, etc.,\r\nthe value of 15,000 rupees was taken. When I had finished inspecting\r\nthe offering I passed nearly one watch of the night in conviviality\r\nand enjoyment. I ordered that cups (of wine) should be given to the\r\nAmirs and servants. The ladies of the mahall (harem) were also with\r\nme, and a pleasant assembly was held. After the festive assembly\r\nwas over I begged I`timadu-d-daulah to excuse me, and went to the\r\nhall of audience. On the same day I ordered Nur-mahall Begam to be\r\ncalled Nur-Jahan Begam. On the 12th the offering of I`tibar Khan was\r\nlaid before me. They had made a vessel (zarf) in the form of a fish,\r\njewelled with beautiful gems, exceedingly well shaped and calculated\r\nto hold my allowance. [490] This, with other jewels and jewelled\r\nthings and cloth stuffs, the value of which was worth 56,000 rupees,\r\nI accepted and gave back the rest. Bahadur Khan, governor of Qandahar,\r\nhad sent seven Iraq horses and nine tuquz (81?) of cloth stuffs. The\r\nofferings of Iradat Khan and Raja Suraj Mal, son of Raja Baso,\r\nwere laid before me on the 13th. `Abdu-s-Subhan, who held a mansab\r\nof 1,200 personal and 600 horse, was promoted to 1,500 personal and\r\n700 horse. On the 15th the Subahdarship of the province of Thatha\r\nwas transferred from Shamshir Khan Uzbeg to Muzaffar Khan. On the\r\n16th the offering of I`tiqad Khan, son of I`timadu-d-daulah, was\r\nlaid before me. Of this the equivalent of 32,000 rupees was taken,\r\nand I gave back the rest to him. On the 17th the offering of Tarbiyat\r\nKhan was inspected. Of jewels and cloth what was valued at 17,000\r\nrupees was approved. On the 18th I went to the house of Asaf Khan,\r\nand his offering was presented to me there. From the palace to his\r\nhouse was a distance of about a kos. For half the distance he had\r\nlaid down under foot velvet woven with gold and gold brocade and plain\r\nvelvet, such that its value was represented to me as 10,000 rupees. I\r\npassed that day until midnight at his house with the ladies. The\r\nofferings he had prepared were laid before me in detail. Jewels,\r\njewelled ornaments, and things of gold and beautiful cloth stuffs,\r\nthings of the value of 114,000 rupees, four horses, and one camel\r\nwere approved of. On the 19th (Farwardin), which was the day of honour\r\n(ruz-i-sharaf) of the sun, a grand assembly was held in the palace. In\r\norder to observe the auspicious hour, when 2 1/2 gharis of day were\r\nleft of the aforesaid day, I seated myself on the throne. My son Baba\r\nKhurram at this blessed hour laid before me a ruby of the purest water\r\nand brilliancy, which they pronounced to be of the value of 80,000\r\nrupees. I fixed his mansab, which was 15,000 personal and 8,000 horse,\r\nat 20,000 personal and 10,000 horse. On the same day my lunar weighing\r\ntook place. I increased the mansab of I`timadu-d-daulah, which was\r\n6,000 personal and 3,000 horse, to 7,000 personal and 5,000 horse,\r\nand bestowed on him a tuman tugh (horse-tail standard), and ordered\r\nhis drums to be beaten after those of my son Khurram. I increased the\r\nmansab of Tarbiyat Khan by 500 personal and horse, so as to bring\r\nit to 3,500 personal and 1,500 horse. The mansab of I`tiqad Khan\r\nwas increased by 1,000 personal and 400 horse. Nizamu-d-din Khan was\r\npromoted to 700 personal and 300 horse, and appointed to the Subah of\r\nBehar. Salamu-llah, the Arab, was honoured with the title of Shaja`at\r\nKhan, and, being dignified with a necklace of pearls, became one of the\r\nroyal [491] servants. I promoted Mir Jamalu-d-din Inju to the title\r\nof `Azudu-d-daulah (Arm of the State). On the 21st Almighty God gave\r\nKhusrau a son by the daughter of Muqim, son of Mihtar Fazil Rikab-dar\r\n(stirrup-holder). To Allah-dad, the Afghan, who, accepting my service,\r\nhad separated himself from the evil-minded Ahdad and come to Court,\r\nI gave 20,000 darabs (10,000 rupees). On the 25th came the news\r\nof the death of Ray Manohar, who had been attached to the army of\r\nthe Deccan. Giving his son a mansab of 500 personal and 300 horse,\r\nI bestowed upon him his father's place and property. On the 26th the\r\noffering of Nad `Ali Maidani, consisting of nine horses, several bits\r\n(? dahana kish [492]), and four Persian camels (wilayati), was brought\r\nbefore me. On the 28th I presented Bahadur Khan, governor of Qandahar,\r\nMir Miran, son of Khalilu-llah, and Sayyid Bayazid, governor of Bhakar,\r\neach with an elephant. On the 1st Urdibihisht, at the request of\r\n`Abdu-llah Khan, I presented drums to his brother Sardar Khan. On the\r\n3rd I gave Allah-dad Khan, the Afghan, a jewelled khapwa (dagger). On\r\nthe same day news came that Qadam, [493] one of the Afridi Afghans\r\nwho had been loyal and obedient, and to whom the rah-dari (transit\r\ndues) of the Khaibar Pass belonged, from some slight suspicion had\r\nwithdrawn his feet from the circle of obedience and raised his head\r\nin sedition. He had sent a force against each of the posts (thana),\r\nand wherever he and his men went, through the carelessness of those men\r\n(in the posts), had plundered and killed many of the people. Briefly,\r\nin consequence of the shameful action of this senseless Afghan,\r\na new disturbance broke out in the hill country of Kabul. When this\r\nnews arrived I ordered Harun, brother of Qadam, and Jalal, his son,\r\nwho were at Court, to be apprehended and handed over to Asaf Khan to\r\nbe imprisoned in the fort of Gwalior. By the manifestation of the\r\nDivine mercy and kindness and the signs of God's favour, an affair\r\ntook place at this time which is not devoid of strangeness. After the\r\nvictory over the Rana my son presented me in Ajmir with an exceedingly\r\nbeautiful and clear ruby, valued at 60,000 rupees. It occurred to me\r\nthat I ought to bind this ruby on my own arm. I much wanted two rare\r\npearls of good water of one form to be a fit match for this kind\r\nof ruby. Muqarrab Khan had procured one grand pearl of the value\r\nof 20,000 rupees, and given it to me as a New Year's offering. It\r\noccurred to me that if I could procure a pair to it they would make a\r\nperfect bracelet. Khurram, who from his childhood had had the honour\r\nof waiting on my revered father, and remained in attendance on him day\r\nand night, represented to me that he had seen a pearl in an old turban\r\n(sar-band) of a weight and shape equal to this pearl. They produced\r\nan old sar-pich (worn on the turban), containing a royal pearl of\r\nthe same quality, weight, and shape, not differing in weight even\r\nby a trifle, so much so that the jewellers were astonished at the\r\nmatter. It agreed in value, shape, lustre, and brilliance; one might\r\nsay they had been shed from the same mould. Placing the two pearls\r\nalongside of the ruby, I bound them on my arm, and placing my head\r\non the ground of supplication and humility, I returned thanks to the\r\nLord that cherished His slave, and made my tongue utter His praise--\r\n\r\n\r\n           \"Who succeeds with hand and tongue?\r\n            He who performs the dues of thanks.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 5th (Urdibihisht) 30 Iraq and Turki horses that Murtaza Khan had\r\nsent from Lahore were brought before me, as also 63 horses, 15 camels,\r\nmale and female, a bundle of crane's (kulang) plumes, 9 `aqiri(?),\r\n[494] 9 veined [495] fish-teeth, 9 pieces of china from Tartary,\r\n3 guns, etc., from Khan Dauran, which he had sent from Kabul, were\r\naccepted. Muqarrab Khan presented an offering of a small elephant\r\nfrom Abyssinia which they had brought by sea in a ship. In comparison\r\nwith the elephants of Hindustan it presents some peculiarities. Its\r\nears are larger than the ears of the elephants of this place, and\r\nits trunk and tail are longer. In the time of my revered father\r\nI`timad Khan of Cujarat sent a young elephant [496] as an offering;\r\nby degrees it grew up and was very fiery and bad-tempered. On the 7th\r\na jewelled dagger was given to Muzaffar Khan, governor of Thatha. On\r\nthe same day news came that a band of Afghans [497] had attacked\r\n`Abdu-s-Subhan, brother of Khan `Alam, who was stationed at one of the\r\nposts, and had laid siege to his post. `Abdu-s-Subhan, with certain\r\nother mansabdars and servants who had been appointed to go with him\r\nhad behaved valiantly. But at last, in accordance with the saying--\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"When gnats get wings they smite the elephant,\"\r\n\r\n\r\nthose dogs overcame them, and elevated `Abdu-s-Subhan with several of\r\nthe men of the post to the dignity of martyrdom. [498] As a condolence\r\nfor this affair a gracious farman and a special dress of honour were\r\nsent to Khan `Alam, who had been appointed ambassador to Iran (and was\r\nstill in that country). On the 14th the offering of Mukarram Khan,\r\nson of Mu`azzam Khan, came from Bengal. It consisted of jewels and\r\narticles procurable in that province, and was brought before me. I\r\nincreased the mansab of some of the jagirdars of Gujarat. Of these,\r\nSardar Khan, whose mansab was that of 1,000 personal and 500 horse, was\r\nraised to 1,500 personal and 300 [499] horse, and had a standard given\r\nto him as well. Sayyid Qasim, son of Sayyid Dilawar Barha, was raised\r\nto an original and increased mansab of 800 personal and 450 horse, and\r\nYar Beg, nephew of Ahmad Qasim Koka, to one of 600 personal with 250\r\nhorse. On the 17th there came the news of the death of Razzaq of Merv,\r\nthe Uzbeg who belonged to the army of the Deccan. He was well skilled\r\nin war, and one of the distinguished Amirs of Mawara'a-n-nahr. On the\r\n21st, Allah-dad, the Afghan, was honoured with the title of Khan, and\r\nhis mansab, which was 1,000 personal and 600 horse, was raised to 2,000\r\npersonal and 1,000 horse. Three hundred thousand rupees out of the\r\ntreasury of Lahore were ordered as a reward and for expenses to Khan\r\nDauran, who had greatly exerted himself in the Afghan disturbance. On\r\nthe 28th, Kunwar Karan obtained leave to go home for his marriage. I\r\nconferred on him a dress of honour, a special Iraq horse with a saddle,\r\nan elephant, and a jewelled waist-dagger. On the 3rd of this month\r\n(Khurdad) the news of the death of Murtaza Khan came. He was one of\r\nthe ancients of this State. My revered father had brought him up and\r\nraised him to a position of consequence and trust. In my reign also\r\nhe obtained the grace of noteworthy service, namely the overthrow\r\nof Khusrau. His mansab had been raised to 6,000 personal and 5,000\r\nhorse. As he was at this time Subahdar of the Panjab, he had undertaken\r\nthe capture of Kangra, to which in strength no other fort in the hill\r\ncountry of that province or even in the whole inhabited world can\r\nbe compared. He had obtained leave to go on this duty. I was much\r\ngrieved in mind at this news; in truth, grief at the death of such\r\na loyal follower is only reasonable. As he had died after spending\r\nhis days in loyalty, I prayed to God for pardon for him. On the 4th\r\nKhurdad the mansab of Sayyid Nizam was fixed, original and increase,\r\nat 900 personal and 650 horse. I gave Nuru-d-din Quli the post of\r\nentertainer to the ambassadors from all parts. On the 7th news came\r\nof the death of Saif Khan Barha; he was a brave and ambitious young\r\nman. He had exerted himself in an exemplary way in the battle with\r\nKhusrau. He bade farewell to this perishable world in the Deccan\r\nthrough cholera (haiza). I conferred favours on his sons. `Ali\r\nMuhammad, who was the eldest and most upright of his children,\r\nwas given the mansab of 300 [500] personal and 400 horse, and his\r\n(`Ali Muhammad's) brother, by name Bahadur, that of 400 personal and\r\n200 horse. Sayyid `Ali, who was his nephew, received an increase in\r\nrank of 500 personal and horse. On the same day Khub-Allah, son of\r\nShah-baz Khan Kambu, received the title of Ran-baz Khan. On the 8th\r\n[501] the mansab of Hashim Khan, original and increase, was fixed\r\nat 2,500 personal and 1,800 horse. On this date I bestowed 20,000\r\ndarabs (10,000 rupees) on Allah-dad Khan, the Afghan. Bikramajit,\r\nRaja of the province of Bandhu, whose ancestors were considerable\r\nzamindars in Hindustan, through the patronage of my fortunate son\r\nBaba Khurram, obtained the blessing of paying his respects to me,\r\nand his offences were pardoned. On the 9th, [502] Kalyan of Jesalmir,\r\nto summon whom Raja Kishan Das had gone, came and waited on me. He\r\npresented 100 muhrs and 1,000 rupees. His elder brother Rawal Bhim\r\nwas a person of distinction. When he died he left a son 2 months old,\r\nand he too did not live long. In the time when I was prince I had taken\r\nhis daughter in marriage, and called her by the title of Malika-Jahan\r\n[503] (queen of the world). As the ancestors of this tribe had come\r\nof ancient loyal people, this alliance took place. Having summoned\r\nthe aforesaid Kalyan, who was the brother of Rawal Bhim, I exalted\r\n[504] him with the tika of Raja and the title of Rawal. News came\r\nthat after the death of Murtaza Khan loyalty was shown by Raja Man,\r\nand that, after giving encouragement to the men of the fort of Kangra\r\nan arrangement had been made that he should bring to Court the son\r\nof the Raja of that country, who was 29 years old. In consequence of\r\nhis great zeal in this service, I fixed his mansab, which was 1,000\r\npersonal and 800 horse, at 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse. Khwaja\r\nJahan was promoted from his original and increased mansab to that of\r\n4,000 personal and 2,500 horse. On this date [505] an event occurred\r\nsuch that, although I was greatly desirous of writing it down, my\r\nhand and heart have failed me. Whenever I took my pen my state became\r\nbewildered, and I helplessly ordered I`timadu-d-daulah to write it.\r\n\r\n\"An ancient sincere slave, I`timadu-d-daulah, by order writes in this\r\nauspicious volume [506] that on the 11th [507] Khurdad the traces of\r\nfever were seen in the pure daughter [508] of Shah Khurram of lofty\r\nfortune, for whom His Majesty showed much affection as the early\r\nfruit of the garden of auspiciousness. After three days pustules\r\n(abila) appeared, and on the 26th of the same month, corresponding with\r\nWednesday, the 29th Jumada-l-awwal (15th June, 1616), in the year 1025,\r\nthe bird of her soul flew from her elemental cage and passed into the\r\ngardens of Paradise. From this date an order was given that Char-shamba\r\n(Wednesday) should be called Kam-shamba (or Gum-shamba). What shall\r\nI write as to what happened to the pure personality of the shadow of\r\nGod in consequence of this heartburning event and grief-increasing\r\ncalamity? Inasmuch as it happened after this manner to that soul of\r\nthe world, what must be the condition of those other [509] servants\r\nwhose life was bound up with that pure personality? For two days\r\nthe servants were not received in audience, and an order was given\r\nthat a wall should be built in front of the house which had been\r\nthe abode of that bird of paradise, so that it might not be seen. In\r\naddition to this he did not adorn the gate of the hall of audience\r\n(did not come there). On the third day he went in an agitated state\r\nto the house of the illustrious prince, and the servants had the good\r\nfortune to pay their salutations and found fresh life. On the road,\r\nhowever much the Hazrat (the Emperor) desired to control himself,\r\nthe tears flowed from the auspicious eyes, and for a long time it\r\nwas so that at the mere hearing of a word from which came a whiff\r\nof pain, the state of the Hazrat became bewildered. He remained for\r\nsome days in the house of the prince of the inhabitants of the world,\r\nand on Monday [510] of Tir, Divine month, he went to the house of\r\nAsaf Khan, and turned back thence to the Chashma-i-Nur, and for\r\ntwo or three days employed himself there. But as long as he was in\r\nAjmir he could not control himself. Whenever the word 'friendship'\r\nreached his ear, the tears would drop from his eyes unrestrained,\r\nand the hearts of his faithful followers were torn in pieces. When\r\nthe departure of the cortège of fortune to the Subah of the Deccan\r\ntook place, he gained a little composure.\"\r\n\r\nOn this date Prithi Chand, son of Ray Manohar, obtained the title of\r\nRay and the mansab of 500 personal and 400 horse, and a jagir in his\r\nnative place. On Saturday, the 11th, I went from the Chashma-i-Nur to\r\nthe palace at Ajmir. On the eve of Sunday, the 12th, after 37 seconds\r\nhad passed, at the time of the ascension of Sagittarius to the 27th\r\ndegree, by the calculations of the Hindu astronomers, and the 15th\r\ndegree of Capricorn, by the calculations of the Greeks, there came from\r\nthe womb of the daughter of Asaf Khan (wife of Khurram) a precious\r\npearl into the world of being. With joy and gladness at this great\r\nboon the drums beat loudly, and the door of pleasure and enjoyment\r\nwas opened in the face of the people. Without delay or reflection\r\nthe name of Shah Shaja`at came to my tongue. I hope that his coming\r\nwill be auspicious and blessed to me and to his father. On the 12th\r\na jewelled dagger [511] and an elephant were bestowed on Rawal Kalyan\r\nof Jesalmir. On the same day arrived the news of the death of Khawass\r\nKhan, whose jagir was in the Sarkar of Qanauj. I gave an elephant\r\nto Ray Kunwar, Diwan of Gujarat. On the 22nd of the same month (Tir)\r\nI added 500 personal and horse to the mansab of Raja Maha Singh, so\r\nas to make it one of 4,000 personal and 3,000 horse. The mansab of\r\n`Ali Khan Tatari, who before this had been exalted with the title of\r\nNusrat Khan, was fixed at 2,000 personal and 500 horse, and a standard\r\nwas also conferred on him. With a view to the accomplishment of certain\r\npurposes, I had made a vow that they should place a gold railing with\r\nlattice-work at [512] the enlightened tomb of the revered Khwaja. On\r\nthe 27th of this month it was completed, and I ordered them to take\r\nand affix it. It had been made at a cost of 110,000 rupees. As the\r\ncommand and leading of the victorious army of the Deccan had not been\r\ncarried out to my satisfaction by my son Sultan Parwiz, it occurred\r\nto me to recall him, and send Baba Khurram as the advanced guard of\r\nthe victorious army, inasmuch as the signs of rectitude and knowledge\r\nof affairs were evident in him, and that I myself would follow him,\r\nso that this important matter would be carried through in one and the\r\nsame campaign. With this object a farman had already been sent in the\r\nname of Parwiz ordering him to start for the Subah of Allahabad, which\r\nis in the centre of my dominions. Whilst I was engaged in the campaign,\r\nhe would be entrusted with the guarding and administration of that\r\nregion. On the 29th of the same month a letter came from Bihari Das,\r\nthe news-writer of Burhanpur, that the prince on the 20th had left\r\nthe city safely and well and gone towards the aforesaid Subah. On the\r\n1st Amurdad I bestowed a jewelled turban on Mirza Raja Bhao Singh. An\r\nelephant was conferred on the shrine of Kushtigir. On the 18th, Lashkar\r\nKhan had sent four ambling (rahwar) horses, and they were brought\r\nbefore me. Mir Mughal was appointed to the faujdarship of the Sarkar\r\nof Sambal in the place of Sayyid `Abdu-l-Waris, who had obtained the\r\ngovernorship of the Subah of Qanauj in the place of Khawass Khan. His\r\nmansab, in view of that duty, was fixed at 500 personal and horse. On\r\nthe 21st the offering of Rawal Kalyan of Jesalmir was laid before me;\r\nit was 3,000 muhrs, 9 horses, 25 camels, and 1 elephant. The mansab\r\nof Qizil-bash Khan was fixed original and increase, at 1,200 personal\r\nand 1,000 horse. On the 23rd, Shaja`at Khan obtained leave to go to\r\nhis jagir that he might arrange the affairs of his servants and his\r\nterritory, and present himself at the time agreed upon. In this year,\r\n[513] or rather in the 10th year after my accession, a great pestilence\r\nappeared in some places in Hindustan. The commencement of this calamity\r\nwas in the parganahs of the Panjab, and by degrees the contagion spread\r\nto the city of Lahore. Many of the people, Musulmans and Hindus,\r\ndied through this. After this it spread to Sirhind and the Du'ab,\r\nuntil it reached Delhi and the surrounding parganahs and villages,\r\nand desolated them. At this day it had greatly diminished. It became\r\nknown from men of great age and from old histories that this disease\r\nhad never shown itself in this country [514] (before). Physicians\r\nand learned men were questioned as to its cause. Some said that it\r\ncame because there had been drought for two years in succession and\r\nlittle rain fell: others said it was on account of the corruption\r\nof the air which occurred through the drought and scarcity. Some\r\nattributed it to other causes. Wisdom is of Allah, and we must submit\r\nto Allah's decrees!\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"What does a slave who bows not his neck to the order?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn 5th Shahriwar 5,000 rupees towards her expenses were sent to the\r\nmother of Mir Miran, the daughter of Shah Isma`il II, by merchants\r\nwho were proceeding to the province of Iraq. On the 6th a letter came\r\nfrom `Abid Khan, [515] bakhshi and news-writer of Ahmadabad, to the\r\npurport that `Abdu-llah Khan Bahadur Firuz-jang had quarrelled with him\r\nbecause he had recorded among (current) events certain affairs that\r\nhad been unpleasing to him, and had sent a body of men against him,\r\nand had insulted him by carrying him away to his house, and had done\r\nthis and that to him. This matter appeared serious to me, and I was\r\ndesirous at once to cast him out of favour and ruin him. At last it\r\noccurred to me to send Dayanat Khan to Ahmadabad to enquire into this\r\nmatter on the spot from disinterested people to see if it had actually\r\noccurred and if so, to bring `Abdu-llah Khan with him to the Court,\r\nleaving the charge and administration of Ahmadabad to Sardar Khan,\r\nhis brother. Before Dayanat Khan started, the news reached Firuz-jang,\r\nand he in a state of great perturbation confessed himself an offender\r\nand started for the Court on foot. Dayanat Khan met him on the road,\r\nand seeing him in a strange condition, as he had wounded his feet\r\nwith walking, he put him on horseback, and taking him with him came\r\nto wait on me. Muqarrab Khan, who is one of the old servants of the\r\nCourt, from the time when I was a prince had continually wanted the\r\nSubah of Gujarat. It thus occurred to me that, as this kind of action\r\non the part of `Abdu-llah Khan had come about, I might fulfil the\r\nhope of an ancient servant and send him to Ahmadabad in the place\r\nof the aforesaid Khan. A fortunate hour was chosen in these days,\r\nand I appointed him to be ruler of the Subah. On the 10th the mansab\r\nof Bahadur Khan, governor of Qandahar, which was 4,000 personal and\r\n3,000 horse, was increased by 500 personal.\r\n\r\nShauqi, the mandolin player, is the wonder of the age. He also sings\r\nHindi and Persian songs in a manner that clears the rust from all\r\nhearts. I delighted him with the title of Anand Khan: Anand in the\r\nHindi language means pleasure and ease.\r\n\r\nMangoes [516] used not to be in season in the country of Hindustan\r\nafter the month of Tir (June-July), (but) Muqarrab Khan had established\r\ngardens in the parganah of Kairana, [517] which is the native place of\r\nhis ancestors, and looked after the mangoes there in such a manner as\r\nto prolong the season for more than two months, and sent them every\r\nday fresh into the special fruit store-house. As this was altogether\r\nan unusual thing to be accomplished, it has been recorded here. On\r\nthe 8th a beautiful Iraq horse of the name of La`l Bi-baha (priceless\r\nruby) was sent for Parwiz by the hand of Sharif, one of his attendants.\r\n\r\nI had ordered quick-handed stone-cutters to carve full-sized\r\nfigures of the Rana and his son Karan out of marble. On this day\r\nthey were completed and submitted to me. I ordered them to be\r\ntaken to Agra and placed in the garden [518] below the jharoka\r\n(exhibition-window). On the 26th the meeting for my solar weighing\r\nwas held in the usual manner. The first weight came to 6,514 tulcha\r\nof gold. I was weighed twelve times against different things; the\r\nsecond weighing was against quicksilver, the third against silk,\r\nthe fourth against various perfumes, such as ambergris and musk,\r\ndown to sandalwood, `ud, ban, and so on, until twelve weighings were\r\ncompleted. Of animals, according to the number of years that I had\r\npassed, a sheep, a goat, [519] and a fowl (for each year) were given\r\nto fakirs and dervishes. This rule has been observed from the time of\r\nmy revered father up to the present day in this enduring State. They\r\ndivide after the weighing all these things among the fakirs and those\r\nin need to the value of about 100,000 rupees.\r\n\r\nThis day a ruby which Mahabat Khan had purchased at Burhanpur for\r\n65,000 rupees from `Abdu-llah Khan Firuz-jang was laid before me, and\r\nwas approved of. It is a ruby of beautiful form. The special mansab\r\nof Khan A`zam was fixed at 7,000 personal, and an order was passed\r\nthat the diwani establishment should pay an equivalent to that in a\r\ntankhwah jagir. At the request of I`timadu-d-daulah, what had been\r\ndeducted from the mansab of Dayanat on account of former proceedings\r\nwas allowed to remain as before. `Azudu-d-daulah, who had obtained\r\nthe Subah of Malwa in jagir, took his leave, and was dignified with\r\nthe gift of a horse and a dress of honour. The mansab of Rawal\r\nKalyan of Jesalmir was fixed at 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse,\r\nand it was ordered that that province (Jesalmir) should be given\r\nhim as tankhwah. As the (auspicious) hour of his departure was on\r\nthat same day, he took leave to depart for his province well pleased\r\nand exalted with the gift of a horse, an elephant, a jewelled sword,\r\na jewelled khapwa (dagger), a robe of honour, and a special Kashmir\r\nshawl. On the 31st Muqarrab Khan took leave to go to Ahmadabad, and\r\nhis mansab, which was 5,000 personal and 2,500 horse, was fixed at\r\n5,000 personal and horse, and he was honoured with a dress of honour,\r\na nadiri (a kind of dress), a takma [520] of pearls, whilst two horses\r\nfrom my private stable, a special elephant, and a jewelled sword\r\nwere also bestowed on him. He went off to the aforesaid Subah with\r\ndelight and in a state of happiness. On the 11th of Mihr, Jagat Singh,\r\nson of Kunwar Karan, came from his native place and waited on me. On\r\nthe 16th, Mirza `Ali Beg Akbarshahi came from the province of Oudh,\r\nwhich had been given him in jagir, and waited on me. He presented as\r\nofferings 1,000 rupees, and he produced before me an elephant which\r\none of the zamindars of that province possessed, and which he had been\r\nordered to take from him. On the 21st the offering of Qutbu-l-mulk,\r\nthe ruler of Golcondah, consisting of some jewelled ornaments, was\r\ninspected by me. The mansab of Sayyid Qasim Barha was fixed, original\r\nand increase, at 1,000 personal and 600 horse. On the eve of Friday,\r\nthe 22nd, Mirza `Ali Beg, whose age had passed 75 years, gave up the\r\ndeposit of his life. Great [521] services had been performed by him\r\nfor this State. His mansab rose by degrees to 4,000. He was one of the\r\ndistinguished heroes of this family (jawanan-i in ulus) [522] and of a\r\nnoble disposition. He left neither son nor other descendants. He had\r\nthe poetic temperament. As his inevitable destiny had been fulfilled\r\n[523] on the day on which he went to pay his devotions at the venerated\r\nmausoleum of Khwaja Mu`inu-d-din, I ordered them to bury him in the\r\nsame blessed place.\r\n\r\nAt the time when I gave leave to the ambassadors of `Adil Khan\r\nof Bijapur, I had requested that if in that province there were a\r\nwrestler, or a celebrated swordsman, they should tell `Adil Khan\r\nto send him to me. After some time, when the ambassadors returned,\r\nthey brought a Mughal, by name Shir `Ali, who was born at Bijapur,\r\nand was a wrestler by profession and had great experience in the art,\r\ntogether with certain sword-players. The performances of the latter\r\nwere indifferent, but I put Shir `Ali to wrestle with the wrestlers\r\nand athletes who were in attendance on me, and they could none of\r\nthem compete with him. One thousand rupees, a dress of honour, and\r\nan elephant were conferred on him; he was exceedingly well made,\r\nwell shaped, and powerful. I retained him in my own service, and\r\nentitled him \"the athlete of the capital.\" A jagir and mansab were\r\ngiven him and great favours bestowed on him. On the 24th, Dayanat Khan,\r\nwho had been appointed to bring `Abdu-llah Khan Bahadur Firuz-jang,\r\nbrought him and waited on me, and presented as an offering 100\r\nmuhrs. On the same date Ram Das, the son of Raja Raj Singh, one of\r\nthe Rajput Amirs who had died on duty in the Deccan, was promoted\r\nto a mansab of 1,000 personal and 500 horse. As `Abdu-llah Khan had\r\nbeen guilty of faults, he made Baba Khurram his intercessor, and on\r\nthe 26th, in order to please him, I ordered the former to pay his\r\nrespects to me. He waited upon me with a face of complete shame,\r\nand presented as offerings 100 muhrs and 1,000 rupees. Before the\r\ncoming of `Adil Khan's ambassadors I had made up my mind that, having\r\nsent Baba Khurram with the vanguard, I should myself proceed to the\r\nDeccan and carry out this important affair, which for some reasons\r\nhad been put off. For this reason I had given an order that except\r\nthe prince no one should represent to me the affairs of the rulers of\r\nthe Deccan. On this day the prince brought the ambassadors and laid\r\ntheir representation before me. After the death of Murtaza Khan,\r\nRaja Man and many of the auxiliary Sardars had come to Court. On\r\nthis day, at the request of I`timadu-d-daulah, I appointed Raja Man\r\nas the leader in the attack on the fort of Kangra. I appointed all\r\nthe men to accompany him, and according to the condition and rank of\r\neach made him happy with a present--a horse, an elephant, a robe of\r\nhonour, or money--and gave them leave. After some days I conferred on\r\n`Abdu-llah Khan, at the request of Baba Khurram, a jewelled dagger,\r\nas he was exceedingly broken-hearted and grieved in mind, and an order\r\nwas passed that his mansab should continue as it was before, and that\r\nhe should remain in attendance on my son among those appointed for duty\r\nin the Deccan. On the 3rd Aban I ordered the mansab of Wazir Khan, who\r\nwas in attendance on Baba Parwiz, to be, original and increase, 2,000\r\npersonal and 1,000 horse. On the 4th, Khusrau, who was in the charge,\r\nfor safe keeping, of Anira'i Singh-dalan, for certain considerations\r\nwas handed over to Asaf Khan. I presented him with a special shawl. On\r\nthe 7th (Aban), corresponding with the 17th Shawwal (28th October,\r\n1616), a person of the name of Muhammad Riza Beg, whom the ruler\r\nof Persia had sent as his representative, paid his respects. After\r\nperforming the dues of prostration and salutation (kurnish, sijda,\r\ntaslim), he laid before me the letter he had brought. It was decided\r\nthat he should produce before me the horses and other presents he\r\nhad brought with him. The written and verbal messages sent were full\r\nof friendship, brotherhood, and sincerity. I gave the ambassador on\r\nthat same day a jewelled tiara (taj) and a dress of honour. As in the\r\nletter much friendliness and affection were displayed, an exact copy\r\nis recorded in the Jahangir-nama. [524]\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the 18th Shawwal, corresponding to the 8th Aban, [525] the\r\ncamp equipage of my son Baba Khurram left Ajmir for the purpose of the\r\nconquest of the provinces of the Deccan, and it was decided that my\r\nson aforesaid should start by way of advanced guard, followed by the\r\nglorious standards (of Jahangir). On Monday, the 19th, corresponding\r\nwith the 9th Aban, when three gharis of day had passed, the auspicious\r\npalace moved in the same direction in the like manner. On the 10th\r\nthe mansab of Raja Suraj Mal, who had been appointed to accompany\r\nthe prince, was made up, original and increase, to 2,000 personal\r\nand horse. On the night of the 19th Aban, after my usual custom,\r\nI was in the ghusul-khana. Some of the Amirs and attendants, and by\r\nchance Muhammad Riza Beg, the ambassador of the ruler of Persia, were\r\npresent. When six gharis had passed, an owl came and sat on top of\r\na high terrace roof belonging to the palace, and was hardly visible,\r\nso that many men failed to distinguish it. I sent for a gun and took\r\naim and fired in the direction that they pointed out to me. The gun,\r\nlike the decree of heaven, fell on that ill-omened bird and blew it to\r\npieces. A shout arose from those who were present, and involuntarily\r\nthey opened their lips in applause and praise. On the same night I\r\ntalked with the ambassador of my brother Shah `Abbas, and at last the\r\nconversation turned on the slaying of Safi Mirza, his (the Shah's)\r\neldest son. I asked him because this was a difficulty in my mind. He\r\nrepresented that if his slaughter had not been carried out at that time\r\nhe would certainly have attempted the Shah's life. As this intention\r\nbecame manifest from his behaviour, the Shah was beforehand with him\r\nand ordered him to be killed. On the same day the mansab of Mirza\r\nHasan, son of Mirza Rustam, was fixed, original and increase, at 1,000\r\npersonal and 300 horse. The mansab of Mu`tamad Khan, [526] who had been\r\nappointed to the post of paymaster of the army with Baba Khurram, was\r\nsettled at 1,000 personal and 250 horse. The time for the leave-taking\r\nof Baba Khurram had been fixed as Friday, the 20th (Aban). At the end\r\nof this day he paraded before me the pick of his men armed and ready\r\nin the public hall of audience. Of the distinguished favours bestowed\r\non the aforesaid son one was the title of Shah, which was made a part\r\nof his name. I ordered that thereafter he should be styled Shah Sultan\r\nKhurram. I presented him with a robe of honour, a jewelled charqab,\r\nthe fringe and collar of which were decorated with pearls, an Iraq\r\nhorse with a jewelled saddle, a Turki horse, a special elephant called\r\nBansi-badan, [527] a carriage, according to the English fashion, [528]\r\nfor him to sit and travel about in, a jewelled sword with a special\r\npardala (sword-belt) that had been taken at the conquest of the fort of\r\nAhmadnagar and was very celebrated, and a jewelled dagger. He started\r\nwith great keenness. My trust in Almighty God is that in this service\r\nhe may gain renown (lit. become red-faced). On each of the Amirs\r\nand mansabdars, according to his quality and degree, a horse and an\r\nelephant were conferred. Loosening a private sword from my own waist,\r\nI gave it to `Abdu-llah Khan Firuz-jang. As Dayanat Khan had been\r\nappointed to accompany the prince, I gave the duty of `arz-mukarrir\r\n(reviser of petitions) to Khwaja Qasim Qilij Khan. Previously [529]\r\nto this a band of thieves had carried off a certain sum of money from\r\nthe royal treasury in the kotwali chabutara (Police Office). After\r\nsome days seven men of that band, with their leader, of the name of\r\nNawal, were caught, and a portion of that money was recovered. It\r\noccurred to me that as they had been guilty of such boldness I ought\r\nto punish them severely. Each was punished in exemplary fashion,\r\nand I ordered Nawal, the leader of them all, to be thrown under the\r\nfeet of an elephant. He petitioned that if I would give the order he\r\nwould fight the elephant. I ordered it to be so. They produced a very\r\nfurious elephant. I bade them put a dagger into his hand and bring him\r\nin front of the elephant. The elephant several times threw him down,\r\nand each time that violent and fearless man, although he witnessed the\r\npunishments of his comrades, got up again and bravely and with a stout\r\nheart struck the elephant's trunk with the dagger, so that the animal\r\nrefrained from attacking him. When I had witnessed this pluck and\r\nmanliness, I ordered them to inquire into his history. After a short\r\ntime, according to his evil nature and low disposition, he ran away\r\nin his longing for his own place and abode. This annoyed me greatly,\r\nand I ordered the jagirdars of that neighbourhood to hunt him up and\r\napprehend him. By chance he was caught a second time, and this time\r\nI ordered that ungrateful and unappreciative one to be hanged. The\r\nsaying of Shaikh Muslihu-d-din Sa`di accords with his case--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"In the end a wolf's cub becomes a wolf,\r\n    Although he be brought up with man.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, [530] the 1st Zi-l-qa`da (10th November, 1616),\r\ncorresponding with the 21st Aban, after two watches and five gharis\r\nof the day had passed, in good condition and with a right purpose\r\nI mounted the Frank carriage, which had four horses attached\r\nto it, and left the city of Ajmir. I ordered many of the Amirs\r\nto accompany me in carriages, and at about sunset alighted at a\r\nhalting-place about 1 3/4 kos distant, in the village of Deo Ray\r\n(Dorai?). [531] It is the custom of the people of India that if\r\nthe movement of kings or great men for the conquest of a country\r\nis towards the east they should ride a tusked elephant, and if the\r\nmovement is towards the west on a horse of one colour; if towards\r\nthe north in a palanquin or a litter (singhasan), and if towards\r\nthe south, that is, in the direction of the Deccan (as on this\r\noccasion), on a rath, which is a kind of cart (araba) or bahal\r\n(two-wheeled car). I had stayed at Ajmir for five days less than\r\nthree years. [532] They consider the city of Ajmir, which is the\r\nplace of the blessed tomb of the revered Khwaja Mu`inu-d-din, to\r\nbe in the second clime. Its air is nearly equable. The capital\r\nof Agra is to the east of it; on the north are the townships\r\n(district) of Delhi, and on the south the Subah of Gujarat. On\r\nthe west lie Multan and Dealpur. The soil of this province\r\nis all sandy; water is found with difficulty in the land, and\r\nthe reliance for cultivation is on moist [533] soil and on the\r\nrainfall. The cold season is very equable, and the hot season\r\nis milder than in Agra. From this subah in time of war 86,000\r\n[534] horse and 304,000 Rajput foot are provided. There are\r\ntwo large lakes in this city; they call one of these the Bisal\r\n[535] and the other the Anasagar. The Bisal tank is in ruins\r\nand its embankment is broken. At this time I ordered it to be\r\nrepaired. The Anasagar at the time that the royal standards were\r\nthere was always full of water and waves. This tal is 1 1/2\r\nkos and 5 tanab (lit. tent-ropes) (in circumference?). Whilst\r\nat Ajmir I visited nine times the mausoleum of the revered\r\nKhwaja, and fifteen times went to look at the Pushkar lake;\r\nto the Chashma-i-Nur I went thirty-eight times. I went out to\r\nhunt tigers, etc., fifty times. I killed 15 tigers, 1 cheetah,\r\n1 black-ear (lynx), 53 nilgaw, 33 gazelle (gawazn), 90 antelope,\r\n80 boars, and 340 water-fowl. I encamped seven times at Deo Ray\r\n(Deo Rani) (Dorai?). At this halt 5 nilgaw and 12 water-fowl were\r\nkilled. Marching on the 29th from Deo Ray, my camp was pitched at\r\nthe village of Dasawali, 2 kos and 1 1/2 quarters distant from Deo\r\nRay. On this day I gave an elephant to Mu`tamad Khan. I stayed\r\nthe next day at this village. On this day a nilgaw was killed,\r\nand I sent two of my falcons to my son Khurram. I marched from\r\nthis village on the 3rd Azar, and pitched at the village of\r\nBadhal (Mawal?), 2 1/4 kos distant. On the road six water-fowl,\r\netc., were killed. On the 4th, having gone 1 1/2 kos, Ramsar,\r\n[536] which belongs to Nur-Jahan Begam, became the place for the\r\nalighting of honour and glory. A halt was made at this place for\r\neight days. In the place of Khidmat-gar Khan I here appointed\r\nHidayatu-llah mir-tuzak (master of ceremonies). On the 5th day\r\n7 antelope, 1 kulang (crane), and 15 fish were killed. The next\r\nday Jagat Singh, son of Kunwar Karan, received a horse and a\r\nrobe of honour and took leave for his native place. A horse was\r\nalso given to Kesho Das Lala and an elephant to Allah-dad Khan\r\nAfghan. On the same day I killed a gazelle, 3 antelope, 7 fish,\r\nand 2 water-fowl. On that day was heard the news of the death\r\nof Raja Syam Singh, who belonged to the army of Bangash. On\r\nthe 7th day 3 antelope, 5 water-fowl, and a qashqaldagh [537]\r\n(coot) were killed. On Thursday and the eve of Friday, as Ramsar\r\nbelongs to the jagir of Nur-Jahan, a feast and entertainment were\r\nprepared. Jewels, jewelled ornaments, fine cloths, sewn tapestry,\r\nand every kind of jewellery were presented as offerings. At night\r\non all sides and in the middle of the lake, which is very broad,\r\nlamps were displayed. An excellent entertainment was arranged. In\r\nthe end of the said Thursday, having also sent for the Amirs, I\r\nordered cups for most [538] of the servants. On my journeys by land\r\nsome boats are always taken along with the victorious camp; the\r\nboatmen convey them on carts. On the day after this entertainment\r\nI went to fish in these boats, and in a short time 208 large fish\r\ncame into one net. Half of these were of the species of raku. At\r\nnight I divided them among the servants in my own presence. On the\r\n13th Azar I marched from Ramsar, and hunting for 4 kos along the\r\nroad, the camp was pitched at the village of Baloda. [539] Here\r\nI stayed for two days. On the 16th, moving 3 1/4 kos, I alighted\r\nat the village of Nihal. [540] On the 18th the march was one of\r\n2 1/4 kos. On this day I gave an elephant to Muhammad Riza Beg,\r\nambassador of the ruler of Persia. The village of Jonsa became\r\nthe halting-place of the tents of greatness and prosperity. On\r\nthe 20th I marched to the halting-place of Deogaon; I hunted along\r\nthe road for a distance of 3 kos. I stayed at this place for two\r\ndays, and at the end of the day went out to hunt. At this stage a\r\nstrange affair was witnessed. Before the royal standards arrived\r\nat this halting-place, an eunuch went to the bank of a large tank\r\nthere is in the village, and caught two young saras, which are a\r\nkind of crane; at night, when we stopped at this halting-place,\r\ntwo large saras appeared making loud cries near the ghusul-khana\r\n(parlour), which they had placed on the edge of the tank, as if\r\nsomebody were exercising oppression on them. They fearlessly began\r\ntheir cries and came forward. It occurred to me that certainly\r\nsome kind of wrong had been done to them, and probably their\r\nyoung had been taken. After enquiry was made the eunuch who had\r\ntaken the young saras brought them before me. When the saras\r\nheard the cries of these young ones, they without control threw\r\nthemselves upon them, and suspecting that they had had no food,\r\neach of the two saras placed food in the mouths of the young ones,\r\nand made much lamentation. Taking the two young ones between them,\r\nand stretching out their wings and fondling them, they went off\r\nto their nest. Marching on the 23rd 3 3/4 kos, I alighted at the\r\nvillage of Bahasu (Bhalu?). Here there was a halt of two days,\r\nand each day I rode to hunt. On the 26th the royal standards moved\r\nand the halt was outside of the village of Kakal. A halt was made\r\nafter traversing 2 kos. On the 27th the mansab of Badi`u-z-zaman,\r\nson of Mirza Shahrukh, original and increased, was fixed at\r\n1,500 personal and 750 horse. Marching on the 29th 2 3/4 kos,\r\na halt was made at the village of Lasa, near parganah Boda. [541]\r\nThis day corresponded with the festival of Qurban (19th December,\r\n1616). I ordered them to observe the ordinances of that day. From\r\nthe date on which I left Ajmir up to the end of the aforesaid\r\nmonth, viz. the 30th Azar, 67 nilgaw, antelope, etc., and 37\r\nwater-fowl etc., had been killed. A march was made from Lasa on\r\nthe 2nd Day, and I marched and hunted for 3 kos 10 jarib, and\r\nhalted in the neighbourhood of the village of Kanra. On the 4th\r\na march of 3 1/4 kos was made to the village of Surath. Marching\r\n4 1/2 kos on the 6th, a halt was made near the village of Barora\r\n(Bardara?). On the 7th, when there was a halt, 50 water-fowl\r\nand 14 qashqaldagh (coot) were killed. The next day was a halt\r\nas well. On this day 27 water-fowl became a prey. On the 9th\r\na march of 4 1/8 kos was made. Hunting and overthrowing prey,\r\nI alighted at the halting-place of Khush Tal. At this stage a\r\nreport came from Mu`tamad Khan that when the territory of the Rana\r\nbecame the halting-place of Shah Khurram, though there had been\r\nno agreement to this effect (i.e. to the Rana's meeting him),\r\nthe fame and dignity of the victorious army had introduced a\r\ncommotion into the pillars of his patience and firmness, and he\r\nhad come and paid his respects to him when he halted at Dudpur,\r\n[542] which was on the border of his jagir, and observing all the\r\ndues and ceremonies of service he had neglected not the smallest\r\nportion of them. Shah Khurram had paid him every attention,\r\nand pleased him with the gift of a dress of honour, a charqab,\r\na jewelled sword, a jewelled khapwa, Persian and Turki horses,\r\nand an elephant, and dismissed him with every honour. He had also\r\nfavoured his sons and relations with dresses of honour, and out\r\nof his offering, which consisted of five elephants, twenty-seven\r\nhorses, and a tray full of jewels and jewelled ornaments, had\r\ntaken three horses and given back the remainder. It was settled\r\nthat his son Karan should attend on the stirrup of Baba Khurram\r\nin this expedition with 1,500 horse. On the 10th the sons of\r\nRaja Maha Singh came from their jagir and native place (Amber)\r\nand waited on me in the neighbourhood of Rantambhor, making an\r\noffering of three elephants and nine horses. Each one of them,\r\naccording to his condition, received an increase of mansab. As\r\nthe neighbourhood of the said fort became a halting-place for the\r\nroyal standards, I released some of the prisoners who were confined\r\nin that fort. At this place I halted for two days and each day\r\nwent to hunt. Thirty-eight water-fowl and qashqaldagh (coot) were\r\ntaken. On the 12th I marched, and after going 4 kos halted at the\r\nvillage of Koyala. On the road I killed fourteen water-fowl and\r\nan antelope. On the 14th, having traversed 3 3/4 kos, I halted in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the village of Ektora, [543] killing on the\r\nroad a blue bull, twelve herons (karwanak), etc. On the same day\r\nAgha Fazil, who had been appointed deputy for I`timadu-d-daulah at\r\nLahore, was dignified with the title of Fazil Khan. At this stage\r\nthey had erected the royal lodging (daulat-khana) on the bank of a\r\ntank, which was exceedingly bright and pleasant. On account of the\r\npleasantness of the place I halted two days there, and at the end\r\nof each went to hunt water-fowl. To this place the younger son of\r\nMahabat Khan, by name Bahra-war, came from the fort of Rantambhor,\r\nwhich is his father's jagir, to pay his respects to me. He had\r\nbrought two elephants, both of which were included in my private\r\nstud. I promoted Safi, son of Amanat Khan, to the title of Khan,\r\nand, increasing his mansab, made him bakhshi and news-writer of\r\nthe Subah of Gujarat. Having travelled 4 1/2 kos on the 17th,\r\nI halted at the village of Lasaya. [544] During the halt I killed\r\none water-fowl and twenty-three sand-grouse (durraj). As I had sent\r\nfor Lashkar Khan to Court on account of the disagreement that had\r\noccurred between him and Khan Dauran, I at this place appointed\r\n`Abid Khan, [545] bakhshi and news-writer, in his stead. On the\r\n19th, having made a march of 2 1/4 kos, an encampment was made\r\nin the neighbourhood of the village of Kuraka (Koran?), [546]\r\nwhich is situated on the bank of the Chambal. On account of the\r\nexcellence of the place and the pleasantness of its air and water,\r\na halt took place here for three days. Every day I sat in a boat\r\nand went to hunt water-fowl and to wander over the river. On the\r\n22nd [547] there was a march, and having traversed 4 1/2 kos,\r\nshooting on the road, the victorious camp was pitched at the\r\nvillages of Sultanpur and Chila Mala (Chilamila?). On this day\r\nof halt I bestowed on Miran Sadr Jahan 5,000 rupees, and gave him\r\nleave to proceed to the place assigned to him as his jagir. Another\r\n1,000 rupees were given to Shaikh Pir. On the 25th I marched and\r\nhunted for 3 1/2 kos and encamped at the village of Basur. [548]\r\nAccording to fixed rules one halt and one march took place, and\r\non the 27th I marched and hunted 4 1/8 kos and encamped at the\r\nvillage of Charduha (Varadha?). Two days halt took place here. In\r\nthis month of Day 416 animals were killed, namely, 97 sand-grouse\r\n(durraj), 192 qashqaldagh, 1 saras, 7 herons, 118 water-fowl, and\r\n1 hare. On the 1st Bahman, corresponding with the 12th Muharram,\r\n1026 (20th January, 1617), seating myself in boats with the ladies,\r\nI went forward one stage. When one ghari of day remained I arrived\r\nat the village of Rupahera, the halting-place, the distance being 4\r\nkos and 15 jarib. I shot five sand-grouse. On the same day I sent\r\nby the hands of Kaikana winter dresses of honour to twenty-one\r\nAmirs on duty in the Deccan, and ordered him to take 10,000 [549]\r\nrupees from those Amirs as a thanksgiving for the dresses of\r\nhonour. This halting-place had much verdure and pleasantness. On\r\nthe 3rd a march took place. As on the previous day, I embarked in\r\na boat, and after traversing 2 1/8 kos the village of Kakha-das\r\n(Kakhavas?) [550] became the encamping place of the victorious\r\ncamp. As I came hunting on the way, a sand-grouse fell flying into a\r\nthicket. After much search it was marked, and I ordered one of the\r\nbeaters to surround the thicket and catch it, and went towards it\r\nmyself. Meanwhile another sand-grouse rose, and this I made a falcon\r\nseize. Soon afterwards the beater came and laid the sand-grouse before\r\nme. I ordered them to satisfy the falcon with this sand-grouse, and to\r\nkeep the one we had caught, as it was a young bird. (But) before the\r\norder reached him the head huntsman fed the falcon with the sand-grouse\r\n(the second one, viz. that which the falcon had caught). After a while\r\nthe beater represented to me that if he did not kill the sand-grouse\r\nit would die (and then could not be eaten as not properly killed). I\r\nordered him to kill it if that was the case. As he laid his sword on\r\nits throat, it with a slight movement freed itself from the sword and\r\nflew away. After I had left the boat and mounted my horse, suddenly\r\na sparrow (kunjishk) by the force of the wind struck the head of an\r\narrow that one of the beaters who was in my retinue had in his hand,\r\nand immediately fell down and died. I was amazed and bewildered at\r\nthe tricks of destiny; on one side it preserved the sand-grouse,\r\nwhose time had not arrived, in a short time from three such dangers,\r\nand on the other hand made captive in the hand of destruction on the\r\narrow of fate the sparrow whose hour of death had come--\r\n\r\n\r\n           \"The world-sword may move from its place,\r\n            But it will cut no vein till God wills.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDresses of honour for the winter had also been sent by the hand of\r\nQara, the yasawul (usher), to the Amirs at Kabul. I halted at this\r\nplace on account of the pleasantness of the spot and the excellence\r\nof the air. On this day there came the news of the death of Nad `Ali\r\nKhan Maidani at Kabul. I honoured his sons with mansabs, and at the\r\nrequest of Ibrahim Khan Firuz-jang [551] increased the mansab of Rawat\r\nShankar by 500 personal and 1,000 horse. On the 6th there was a march,\r\nand going for 4 1/8 kos by the pass known as Ghate Chanda, the royal\r\ncamp was pitched at the village of Amhar (Amjar?). This valley is very\r\ngreen and pleasant and good trees are seen in it. Up to this stage,\r\nwhich is the limit of the country of the Subah of Ajmir, 84 kos had\r\nbeen traversed. It was also a pleasant stage. Nur-Jahan Begam here\r\nshot with a gun a qarisha(?), the like of which for size and beauty of\r\ncolour had never been seen. I ordered them to weigh it, and it came to\r\n19 tolas and 5 mashas. The aforesaid village is the commencement of the\r\nSubah of Malwa, which is in the second clime. The length [552] of this\r\nSubah from the extremity of the province of Garha to the province of\r\nBanswala (Banswara?) is 245 kos, and its breadth from the parganah of\r\nChanderi to the parganah of Nandarbar is 230 kos. On the east is the\r\nprovince of Bandho, and on the north the fort of Narwar, on the south\r\nthe province of Baglana, and on the west the Subahs of Gujarat and\r\nAjmir. Malwa is a large province abounding in water and of a pleasant\r\nclimate. There are five rivers in it in addition to streams, canals,\r\nand springs, namely, the Godavari, [553] Bhima, Kalisindh, Nira, and\r\nNarbada. Its climate is nearly equable. The land of this province is\r\nlow, but part of it is high. In the district of Dhar, which is one of\r\nthe noted places of Malwa, the vine gives grapes twice in the year,\r\nin the beginning of Pisces and the beginning of Leo, but the grapes\r\nof Pisces are the sweeter. Its husbandmen and artificers are not\r\nwithout arms. The revenue of the province is 24,700,000 dams. When\r\nneedful there are obtained from it about 9,300 [554] horse and four\r\nlakhs, 70,300 foot-soldiers, with 100 elephants. On the 8th, moving\r\non 3 1/2 kos, an encampment was made near Khairabad. On the road\r\n14 sand-grouse and 3 herons were killed, and having traversed and\r\nshot over 3 kos the camp was pitched at the village of Sidhara. On\r\nthe 11th, while there was a halt, I mounted at the end of the day to\r\nhunt, and killed a blue bull. On the 12th, after traversing 4 1/4 kos,\r\na halt was made at the village of Bachhayari. On that day Rana Amar\r\nSingh had sent some baskets of figs. In truth it is a fine fruit, and\r\nI had never seen such delicious figs in India. But one must eat only a\r\nfew of them; it does harm to eat many. On the 14th there was a march;\r\nhaving traversed 4 1/8 kos, I encamped at the village of Balbali. Raja\r\nJanba who is an influential zamindar in these regions, had sent two\r\nelephants as an offering, and they were brought before me. At the\r\nsame stage they brought many melons grown in Kariz near Herat. Khan\r\n`Alam had also sent 50 camels. In former years they had never brought\r\nmelons in such abundance. On one tray they brought many kinds of\r\nfruit--Kariz melons, melons from Badakhshan and Kabul, grapes from\r\nSamarkand [555] and Badakhshan, apples from Samarkand, Kashmir, Kabul,\r\nand from Jalalabad, which is a dependency of Kabul, and pineapples,\r\na fruit that comes from the European ports, plants of which have been\r\nset in Agra. Every year some thousands are gathered in the gardens\r\nthere which appertain to the private domains (khalisa-i-sharifa) [556];\r\nkaula, [557] which are similar in form to an orange, but smaller and\r\nbetter in flavour. They grow very well in the Subah of Bengal. In what\r\nlanguage can one give thanks for such favours? My revered father had\r\na great liking for fruit, especially for melons, pomegranates, and\r\ngrapes. During his time the Kariz melons, which are the finest kind,\r\nand pomegranates from Yezd, which are celebrated throughout the world\r\nand Samarkand grapes had not been brought to Hindustan. Whenever I\r\nsee these fruits they cause me great regret. Would that such fruit\r\nhad come in those days, so that he might have enjoyed them!\r\n\r\nOn the 15th, which was a halting day, news came of the death of Mir\r\n`Ali, son of Faridun Khan Barlas, who was one of the trusted amir-zadas\r\n(descended from amirs) of this family (the Timurides). On the 16th\r\na march took place. Having traversed 4 1/8 kos, the camp of heavenly\r\ndignity was pitched near the village of Giri. On the road the scouts\r\nbrought news that there was a lion in this neighbourhood. I went\r\nto hunt him and finished him with one shot. As the braveness of\r\nthe lion (shir babar) has been established, I wished to look at his\r\nintestines. After they were extracted, it appeared that in a manner\r\ncontrary to other animals, whose gall-bladder is outside their livers,\r\nthe gall-bladder of the lion is within his liver(?). It occurred to me\r\nthat the courage of the lion may be from this cause. On the 18th, after\r\ntraversing 2 3/4 kos, the village of Amriya was our halting-place. On\r\nthe 19th, which was a halt, I went out to hunt. After going 2 kos,\r\na village came to view exceedingly sweet and pleasant. Nearly 100\r\nmango-trees were seen in one garden; I had seldom seen mango-trees\r\nso large and green and pleasant. In the same garden I saw a bar-tree\r\n(a banyan), exceedingly large. I ordered them to measure its length,\r\nbreadth, and height in yards (gaz). Its height from the surface to the\r\nhighest branch (sar-shakh) was 74 cubits (zira`). The circumference\r\nof its trunk was 44 1/2 cubits and its breadth [558] 175 1/2 measured\r\nby the gaz. This has been recorded as it is very unusual. On the 20th\r\nwas a march, and on the road a blue bull was shot with a gun. On the\r\n21st, which was a halt, I went out to hunt at the end of the day. After\r\nreturning, I came to the house of I`timadu-d-daulah for the festival\r\nof Khwaja Khizr, whom they call Khizri; I remained there till a watch\r\nof the night had passed, and then feeling inclined for food I went\r\nback to the royal quarters. On this day I honoured I`timadu-d-daulah\r\nas an intimate friend by directing the ladies of the harem not to\r\nveil their faces from him. By this favour I bestowed everlasting\r\nhonour on him. On the 22nd an order was given to march, and after\r\n3 1/8 kos were traversed the camp was pitched at the village of\r\nBulghari (Nawalkheri?). On the road two blue bulls were killed. On\r\nthe 23rd day of Tir, which was a halt, I killed a blue bull with a\r\ngun. On the 24th, traversing 5 kos, the village of Qasim-khera was\r\nthe halting-place. On the road a white animal [559] was killed, which\r\nresembled the kutah paya (hog-deer); it had four horns, two of which\r\nwere opposite the extremities of its eyes, and two finger-breadths in\r\nheight, and the two other horns four finger-breadths towards the nape\r\nof the neck. These were four finger-breadths in height. The people of\r\nIndia call this animal dudhadharit (dudhariya?). The male has four\r\nhorns and the female none. It was said that this kind of antelope\r\nhas no gall-bladder, but when they looked at its intestines the\r\ngall-bladder was apparent, and it became clear that this report has\r\nno foundation. On the 25th, which was a halt, at the end of the day I\r\nrode out to hunt and killed a female nilgaw with my gun. Balju, nephew\r\nof Qilij Khan, who held the mansab of 1,000 personal and 850 horse,\r\nand had a jagir in Oudh, I promoted to 2,000 personal and 1,200 horse,\r\ndignified him with the title of Qilij Khan, and appointed him to the\r\nSubah of Bengal. On the 26th a march took place, and after traversing\r\n4 3/4 kos a halt was made at the village of Dih Qaziyan, which is in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Ujjain. A number of mango-trees in this place\r\nhad blossomed. They had pitched the tents on the bank of a lake, and\r\nhad prepared an enchanting place. Pahar, son of Ghaznin [560] Khan,\r\nwas capitally punished at this stage. Cherishing this unlucky one\r\nafter the death of his father, I had given him the fort and province\r\nof Jalaur, which was the place of his ancestors. As he was of tender\r\nyears, his mother used to forbid him certain evil practices. That\r\neternally black-faced one with some of his companions one night came\r\ninto the house and killed his own full mother with his own hand. This\r\nnews reached me and I ordered them to bring him. After his crime was\r\nproved against him, I ordered them to put him to death (kih ba biyasa\r\nrasanidand). At this halting-place a tamarind [561]-tree came to view,\r\nthe form and habit of which were somewhat strange. The original tree\r\nhad one trunk; when it had grown to 6 gaz, it turned into two branches,\r\none of which was 10 and the other 9 1/2 gaz. The distance between\r\nthe two branches was 4 1/2 gaz. From the ground to the place where\r\nthe branches and leaves came to an end(?), there were on the side of\r\nthe large branch 16 gaz, and on the other branch 15 1/2 gaz. From\r\nthe place whence the branches and green leaves began(?) to the top\r\n(trunk?) of the tree was 2 1/2 gaz, and the circumference was 2 3/4\r\ngaz. I ordered them to make a chabutara (platform) round it of the\r\nheight of 3 gaz. As the trunk was very straight and well-shaped, I told\r\nmy artists to depict it in the illustrations to the Jahangir-nama. A\r\nmarch was made on the 27th. After traversing 2 1/8 kos, a halt was\r\nmade at the village of Hinduwal [562]; on the road a blue bull was\r\nkilled. On the 28th, after traversing 2 kos, the village of Kaliyadaha\r\nbecame the halting-place. Kaliyadaha is a building which was made\r\nby Nasiru-d-din, son of Ghiyasu-d-din, son of Sultan Mahmud Khalji,\r\nwho was ruler of Malwa. In the time of his rule he had made it in the\r\nneighbourhood of Ujjain, which is one of the most celebrated cities\r\nin the Subah of Malwa. They say that the heat overcame him so much\r\nthat he passed his time in the water. He made this building in the\r\nmiddle of the river, and divided its waters into canals, and brought\r\nthe water on all sides, as well as inside and outside, of the house,\r\nand made large and small reservoirs suited to the place. It is a\r\nvery pleasant and enjoyable place, and one of the noted habitations\r\nof Hindustan. Before it was decided to halt at this place I sent\r\narchitects and ordered them to clean up the place again. On account of\r\nits pleasantness I remained in this place for three days. At the same\r\nplace Shaja`at Khan came from his jagir and waited on me. Ujjain is\r\none of the old cities, and is one of the seven established places of\r\nworship of the Hindus. Raja Bikramajit, who introduced the observation\r\nof the heavens and stars into Hindustan, lived in this city and\r\nprovince. From the time of his observations until now, which is the\r\n1026th Hijra year (1617 A.D.) and the 11th year from my accession,\r\n1,675 [563] years have passed. The deductions of the astronomers of\r\nIndia are all based on his observations. This city is on the bank of\r\nthe River Sipra. The belief [564] of the Hindus is that once in some\r\nyear at an uncertain time the water of this river turns into milk. In\r\nthe reign of my revered father, at the time when he had sent Abu-l-fazl\r\nto set in order the affairs of my brother Shah Murad, he sent a report\r\nfrom that city that a large body of Hindus and Musulmans had borne\r\ntestimony that some days previously at night this river had become\r\nmilk, so that people who took water from it that night found in the\r\nmorning their pots full of milk. [565] As this obtained currency it\r\nhas been recorded, but my intelligence will in no way agree to it. The\r\nreal truth of this affair is known to Allah. On the 2nd Isfandarmuz\r\nI embarked in a boat from Kaliyadaha, and went to the next stage. I\r\nhad frequently heard that an austere Sanyasi [566] of the name of\r\nJadrup many years ago retired from the city of Ujjain to a corner of\r\nthe desert and employed himself in the worship of the true God. I had\r\na great desire for his acquaintance, and when I was at the capital\r\nof Agra I was desirous of sending for and seeing him. In the end,\r\nthinking of the trouble it would give him, I did not send for him. When\r\nI arrived in the neighbourhood of the city I alighted from the boat\r\nand went 1/8 kos on foot to see him. The place he had chosen to live\r\nin was a hole on the side of a hill which had been dug out and a door\r\nmade. At the entrance there is an opening in the shape of a mihrab,\r\n[567] which is in length (? height) 1 gaz and in breadth 10 gira,\r\n(knots, each 1/16 of a gaz), and the distance from this door to a hole\r\nwhich is his real abode is 2 gaz and 5 knots in length and in breadth\r\n11 1/4 knots. The height from the ground to the roof is 1 gaz and 3\r\nknots. The hole whence is the entrance to the abode is in length 5 1/2\r\nknots and its breadth 3 1/2 knots. A person of weak body (thin?) can\r\nonly enter it with a hundred difficulties. The length and breadth\r\nof the hole are such. It has no mat and no straw. In this narrow and\r\ndark hole he passes his time in solitude. In the cold days of winter,\r\nthough he is quite naked, with the exception of a piece of rag that\r\nhe has in front and behind, he never lights a fire. The Mulla of Rum\r\n(Jalalu-d-din) has put into rhyme the language of a dervish--\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"By day our clothes are the sun,\r\n        By night our mattress and blanket the moon's rays.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHe bathes twice a day in a piece of water near his abode, and once\r\na day goes into the city of Ujjain, and nowhere but to the houses\r\nof three brahmins whom he has selected out of seven, who have wives\r\nand children and whom he believes to have religious feelings and\r\ncontentment. He takes by way of alms five mouthfuls of food out\r\nof what they have prepared for their own eating, which he swallows\r\nwithout chewing, in order that he may not enjoy their flavour; always\r\nprovided that no misfortune has happened to their three houses, that\r\nthere has been no birth, and there be no menstruous woman in the\r\nhouse. This is his method of living, just as it is now written. He\r\ndoes not desire to associate with men, but as he has obtained great\r\nnotoriety people go to see him. He is not devoid of knowledge, for\r\nhe has thoroughly mastered the science of the Vedanta, which is the\r\nscience of Sufism. I conversed with him for six gharis; he spoke well,\r\nso much so as to make a great impression on me. My society also suited\r\nhim. At the time when my revered father conquered the fort of Asir,\r\nin the province of Khandesh, and was returning to Agra, he saw him\r\nin the very same place, and always remembered him well.\r\n\r\nThe learned of India have established four modes of life for the caste\r\nof brahmins, which is the most honoured of the castes of Hindus,\r\nand have divided their lives into four periods. These four periods\r\nthey call the four asram. [568] The boy who is born in a brahmin's\r\nhouse they do not call brahmin till he is 7 years old, and take no\r\ntrouble on the subject. After he has arrived at the age of 8 years,\r\nthey have a meeting and collect the brahmins together. They make\r\na cord of munj grass, which they call munji, in length 2 1/4 gaz,\r\nand having caused prayers and incantations to be repeated over it,\r\nand having had it made into three strands, which they call sih tan, by\r\none in whom they have confidence, they fasten it on his waist. Having\r\nwoven a zunnar (girdle or thread) out of the loose threads, they hang\r\nit over his right [569] shoulder. Having given into his hand a stick of\r\nthe length of a little over 1 gaz to defend himself with from hurtful\r\nthings and a copper vessel for drinking-water, they hand him over to\r\na learned brahmin that he may remain in his house for twelve years,\r\nand employ himself in reading the Vedas, which they believe in as\r\nGod's book. From this day forward they call him a brahmin. During this\r\ntime it is necessary that he should altogether abstain from bodily\r\npleasures. When midday is passed he goes as a beggar to the houses\r\nof other brahmins, and bringing what is given him to his preceptor,\r\neats it with his permission. For clothing, with the exception of a\r\nloin cloth (lungi) of cotton to cover his private parts, and 2 or\r\n3 more gaz of cotton which he throws over his back, he has nothing\r\nelse. This state is called brahmacharya, that is, being busied with\r\nthe Divine books. After this period has passed, with the leave of\r\nhis preceptor and his father, he marries, and is allowed to enjoy\r\nall the pleasures of his five senses until the time when he has a\r\nson who shall have attained the age of 16 years. If he does not have\r\na son, he passes his days till he is 48 in the social life. During\r\nthis time they call him a grihast, that is, householder. After that\r\ntime, separating himself from relatives, connections, strangers,\r\nand friends, and giving up all things of enjoyment and pleasure,\r\nhe retires to a place of solitude from the place of attachment to\r\nsociality (ta`alluq-i-abad-i-kasrat), and passes his days in the\r\njungle. They call this condition banprasta, [570] that is, abode in\r\nthe jungle. As it is a maxim of the Hindus that no good deed can be\r\nthoroughly performed by men in the social state without the partnership\r\nof the presence of a wife, whom they have styled the half of a man,\r\nand as a portion of the ceremonies and worshippings is yet before\r\nhim (has to be accomplished), he takes his wife with him into the\r\njungle. If she should be pregnant, he puts off his going until she\r\nbear a child and it arrive at the age of 5 years. Then he entrusts\r\nthe child to his eldest son or other relation, and carries out his\r\nintention. In the same way, if his wife be menstruous, he puts off\r\ngoing until she is purified. After this he has no connection with\r\nher, and does not defile himself with communication with her, and at\r\nnight he sleeps apart. [571] He passes twelve years in this place,\r\nand lives on vegetables which may have sprung up of themselves\r\nin the desert and jungle. He keeps his zunnar by him and worships\r\nfire. He does not waste his time in looking after his nails or the\r\nhair of his head, or in trimming his beard and moustaches. When he\r\ncompletes this period in the manner related, he returns to his own\r\nhouse, and having commended his wife to his children and brothers\r\nand sons-in-law, goes to pay his respects to his spiritual guide,\r\nand burns by throwing into the fire in his presence whatever he has\r\nin the way of a zunnar, the hair of his head, etc., and says to him:\r\n\"Whatever attachment (ta`alluq) I may have had, even to abstinence\r\nand worshipping and will, I have rooted up out of my heart.\" Then he\r\ncloses the road to his heart and to his desires and is always employed\r\nin contemplation of God, and knows no one except the True Cause of\r\nBeing (God). If he speak of science it is the science of Vedanta,\r\nthe purport of which Baba Fighani has versified in this couplet--\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"There's one lamp in this house, by whose rays\r\n        Wherever I look there is an assembly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThey call this state sarvabiyas, [572] that is, giving up all. They\r\ncall him who possesses it sarvabiyasi.\r\n\r\nAfter interviewing Jadrup I mounted an elephant and passed through the\r\ntown of Ujjain, and as I went scattered to the right and left small\r\ncoins to the value of 3,500 rupees, and proceeding 1 3/4 kos alighted\r\nat Da'ud-khera, the place where the royal camp was pitched. On the\r\n3rd day, which was a halting day, I went, from desire for association\r\nwith him, after midday, to see Jadrup, and for six gharis enjoyed\r\nmyself in his company. On this day also he uttered good words,\r\nand it was near evening when I entered my palace. On the 4th day\r\nI journeyed 3 1/4 kos and halted at the village of Jarao [573] in\r\nthe Paraniya garden. This is also a very pleasant halting-place,\r\nfull of trees. On the 6th there was a march; after proceeding for\r\n4 3/4 kos I halted on the bank of the lake of Debalpur Bheriya. On\r\naccount of the pleasantness of the place and the delights of the lake,\r\nI halted at this stage for four days, and at the end of each day,\r\nembarking in a boat, employed myself in shooting ducks (murghabi)\r\nand other aquatic animals. At this halting-place they brought fakhri\r\ngrapes from Ahmadnagar. Although they are not as large as the Kabul\r\nfakhri grapes, they do not yield to them in sweetness.\r\n\r\nAt the request of my son Baba Khurram the mansab of Badi`u-z-zaman,\r\nson of Mirza Shahrukh, was fixed at 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse. On\r\nthe 11th I marched, and after proceeding for 3 1/4 kos halted in\r\nthe parganah Daulatabad. On the 12th, which was a halt, I rode out\r\nto hunt. In the village of Shaikhupur, which belonged to the said\r\nparganah, I saw a very large and bulky banyan-tree, measuring round\r\nits trunk 18 1/2 gaz, and in height from the root to the top of the\r\nbranches 128 1/4 cubits. The branches spread a shade for 203 1/2\r\ncubits. The length of a branch, on which they have represented the\r\ntusks of an elephant, was 40 gaz. At the time when my revered father\r\npassed by this, he had made an impression of his hand by way of a\r\nmark at the height of 3 3/4 gaz from the ground. I ordered them also\r\nto make the mark of my hand 8 gaz above another root. In order that\r\nthese two hand-marks might not be effaced in the course of time, they\r\nwere carved on a piece of marble and fastened on to the trunk of the\r\ntree. I ordered them to place a chabutara and platform round the tree.\r\n\r\nAs at the time when I was prince I had promised Mir Ziya'u-din\r\nQazwini, who was one of the Saifi Sayyids, and whom during my reign\r\nI have honoured with the title of Mustafa Khan, to give the parganah\r\nof Maldah, which is a famous parganah in Bengal, to him and his\r\ndescendants [574] in al tamgha (perpetual royal grant), this great\r\ngift was bestowed in his honour at this halting-place. On the 13th a\r\nmarch took place. Going separately from this camp to look round the\r\ncountry and hunt with some of the ladies and intimates and servants, I\r\nproceeded to the village of Hasilpur, and whilst the camp was pitched\r\nin the neighbourhood of Nalcha (Balchha?) I halted at the village\r\nof Sangor. What shall be written of the beauty and sweetness of this\r\nvillage? There were many mango-trees, and its lands were altogether\r\ngreen and delightful. On account of its greenness and pleasantness\r\nI halted here for three days. I gave this village to Kamal Khan,\r\nthe huntsman, in place of Kesho Das Maru. An order was passed that\r\nthey should hereafter call it Kamalpur. At this same halting-place\r\noccurred the night of Shivrat (Shivratri). Many Jogis collected. The\r\nceremonies of this night were duly observed, and I met the learned\r\nof this body in social intercourse. In these days I shot three blue\r\nbulls. The news of the killing of Raja Man reached me at this place. I\r\nhad appointed him to head the army that had been sent against the fort\r\nof Kangra. When he arrived at Lahore he heard that Sangram, one of the\r\nzamindars of the hill-country of the Panjab, had attacked his place\r\nand taken possession of part of his province. Considering it of the\r\nfirst importance to drive him out, he went against him. As Sangram\r\nhad not the power to oppose him, he left the country of which he had\r\ntaken possession and took refuge in difficult hills and places. Raja\r\nMan pursued him there, and in his great pride, not looking to the\r\nmeans by which he himself could advance and retreat, came up to him\r\nwith a small force. When Sangram saw that he had no way to flee by,\r\nin accordance with this couplet--\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"In time of need when no (way of) flight is left,\r\n        The hand seizes the edge of the sharp sword.\" [575]\r\n\r\n\r\nA fight took place, and according to what was decreed, a bullet\r\nstruck Raja Man and he delivered his soul to the Creator thereof. His\r\nmen were defeated and a great number of them killed. The remainder,\r\nwounded, abandoned their horses and arms, and with a hundred alarms\r\nescaped half-dead.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th I marched from Sangor, and after proceeding 3 kos came\r\nagain to the village of Hasilpur. On the road a blue bull was\r\nkilled. This village is one of the noted places in the Subah of\r\nMalwa. It has many vines and mango-trees without number. It has\r\nstreams flowing on all sides of it. At the time I arrived there\r\nwere grapes contrary to the season in which they are in the Wilayat\r\n(Persia or Afghanistan). They were so cheap and plentiful that the\r\nlowest and meanest could get as much as they desired. The poppy had\r\nflowered and showed varied colours. In brief, there are few villages\r\nso pleasant. For three days more I halted in this village. Three\r\nblue bulls were killed with my gun. From Hasilpur on the 21st in two\r\nmarches I rejoined the big camp. On the road a blue bull was killed. On\r\nSunday, the 22nd, marching from the neighbourhood of Nalcha (Balchha?),\r\nI pitched at a lake that is at the foot of the fort of Mandu. On that\r\nday the huntsmen brought news that they had marked down a tiger within\r\n3 kos. Although it was Sunday, and on these two days, viz. Sunday and\r\nThursday, I do not shoot, it occurred to me that as it is a noxious\r\nanimal it ought to be done away with. I proceeded towards him, and when\r\nI arrived at the place it was sitting under the shade of a tree. Seeing\r\nits mouth, which was half open, from the back of the elephant, I fired\r\nmy gun. By chance it entered its mouth and found a place in its throat\r\nand brain, and its affair was finished with that one shot. After this\r\nthe people who were with me, although they looked for the place where\r\nthe tiger was wounded, could not find it, for on none of its limbs was\r\nthere any sign of a gunshot wound. At last I ordered them to look in\r\nits mouth. From this it was evident that the bullet had entered its\r\nmouth and that it had been killed thereby. Mirza Rustam had killed\r\na male wolf and brought it. I wished to see whether its gall-bladder\r\nwas in its liver like that of the tiger, or like other animals outside\r\nits liver. After examination it was clear that the gall-bladder was\r\nalso inside the liver. On Monday, the 23rd, when one watch had passed\r\nin a fortunate ascension and a benign hour, I mounted an elephant\r\nand approached the fort of Mandu. When a watch and three gharis of\r\nday had passed, I entered the houses which they had prepared for\r\nthe royal accommodation. I scattered 1,500 rupees on the way. From\r\nAjmir to Mandu, 159 kos, in the space of four months and two days,\r\nin forty-six marches and seventy-eight halts, had been traversed. In\r\nthese forty-six marches our halts were made on the banks of tanks or\r\nstreams or large rivers in pleasant places which were full of trees\r\nand poppy-fields in flower, and no day passed that I did not hunt\r\nwhile halting or travelling. Riding on horseback or on an elephant I\r\ncame along the whole way looking about and hunting, and none of the\r\ndifficulties of travelling were experienced; one might say that there\r\nwas a change from one garden to another. In these huntings there were\r\nalways present with me Asaf Khan, Mirza Rustam, Mir Miran, Anira'i,\r\nHidayatu-llah, Raja Sarang Deo, Sayyid Kasu, and Khawass Khan. As\r\nbefore the arrival of the royal standards in these regions I had sent\r\n`Abdu-l-Karim, the architect, to look to the repair of the buildings of\r\nthe old rulers in Mandu, he during the time the camp halted at Ajmir\r\nhad repaired some of the old buildings that were capable of repair,\r\nand had altogether rebuilt some places. In short, he had made ready\r\na house the like of which for pleasantness and sweetness has probably\r\nnot been made anywhere else. Nearly 300,000 rupees, or 2,000 Persian\r\ntumans, were expended on this. There should be such grand buildings\r\nin all great cities as might be fit for royal accommodation. This\r\nfort is on the top of a hill 10 kos in circumference; in the rainy\r\nseason there is no place with the fine air and pleasantness of this\r\nfort. At nights, in the season of the qalbu-l-asad (Cor leonis of\r\nRegulus, the star a of Leo), it is so cold that one cannot do without\r\na coverlet, and by day there is no need for a fan (bad-zan). They say\r\n[576] that before the time of Raja Bikramajit there was a Raja of the\r\nname of Jai Singh Deo. In his time a man had gone into the fields to\r\nbring grass. While he was cutting it, the sickle he had in his hand\r\nappeared to be of the colour of gold. When he saw that his sickle had\r\nbeen transmuted, he took it to a blacksmith of the name of Madan [577]\r\nto be repaired. The blacksmith knew the sickle had been turned into\r\ngold. It had before this been heard that there was in this country\r\nthe alchemist's stone (sang-i-paras), by contact with which iron and\r\ncopper became gold. He immediately took the grass-cutter with him to\r\nthat place and procured the stone. After this he brought to the Raja\r\nof the time this priceless jewel. The Raja by means of this stone made\r\ngold, and spent part of it on the buildings of this fort and completed\r\nthem in the space of twelve years. At the desire of that blacksmith he\r\ncaused them to cut into the shape of an anvil most of the stones that\r\nwere to be built into the wall of the fort. At the end of his life,\r\nwhen his heart had given up the world, he held an assembly on the bank\r\nof the Narbada, which is an object of worship among the Hindus, and,\r\nassembling brahmins, made presents to each of cash and jewels. When\r\nthe turn of a brahmin came who had long been associated with him,\r\nhe gave this stone into his hand. He from ignorance became angry and\r\nthrew the priceless jewel into the river. After he came to know the\r\ntrue state of the affair he was a captive to perpetual sorrow. However\r\nmuch he searched, no trace of it was found. These things are not\r\nwritten in a book; they have been heard, but my intelligence in no\r\nway accepts this story. It appears to me to be all delusion. Mandu\r\n[578] is one of the famous Sarkars of the Subah of Malwa. Its revenue\r\nis 1,390,000 dams. It was for a long time the capital of the kings\r\nof this country. There are many buildings and traces of former kings\r\nin it, and up till now it has not fallen into ruin.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th I rode to go round and see the buildings of the old kings,\r\nand went first to the Jami` mosque, which is one built by Sultan\r\nHushang Ghuri. A very lofty building came to view, all of cut stone,\r\nand although 180 years have passed since the time of its building,\r\nit is as if the builder had just withdrawn his hand from it. After\r\nthis I went to the building containing the tombs of the Khalji\r\nrulers. The grave of Nasiru-d-din, son of Sultan Ghiyasu-d-din,\r\nwhose face is blackened for ever, was also there. It is well known\r\nthat that wretch advanced himself by the murder of his own father,\r\nGhiyasu-d-din, who was in his 80th year. Twice he gave him poison,\r\nand he twice expelled it by means of a zahr-muhra (poison antidote,\r\nbezoar) he had on his arm. The third time he mixed poison in a cup\r\nof sherbet and gave it to his father with his own hand, saying he\r\nmust drink it. As his father understood what efforts he was making\r\nin this matter, he loosened the zahr-muhra from his arm and threw it\r\nbefore him, and then turning his face in humility and supplication\r\ntowards the throne of the Creator, who requires no supplication,\r\nsaid: \"O Lord, my age has arrived at 80 years, and I have passed this\r\ntime in prosperity and happiness such as has been attained to by no\r\nking. Now as this is my last time, I hope that Thou wilt not seize\r\nNasir for my murder, and that reckoning my death as a thing decreed\r\nThou wilt not avenge it.\" After he had spoken these words, he drank\r\noff that poisoned cup of sherbet at a gulp and delivered his soul\r\nto the Creator. The meaning of his preamble was that he had passed\r\nthe time of his reign in enjoyment such as has not been attained to\r\nby any of the kings. When in his 48th year he came to the throne,\r\nhe said to his intimates and those near him, \"In the service of my\r\nrevered father I have passed thirty years in warfare and have committed\r\nno fault in my activity as a soldier; now that my turn to reign has\r\narrived, I have no intention to conquer countries, but desire to pass\r\nthe remainder of my life in ease and enjoyment.\" They say that he\r\nhad collected 15,000 women in his harem. He had a whole city of them,\r\nand had made it up of all castes, kinds, and descriptions--artificers,\r\nmagistrates, qazis, kotwals, and whatever else is necessary for the\r\nadministration of a town. Wherever he heard of a virgin possessed of\r\nbeauty, he would not desist (lit. did not sit down from his feet)\r\nuntil he possessed her. He taught the girls all kinds of arts and\r\ncrafts, and was much inclined to hunt. He had made a deer park and\r\ncollected all kinds of animals in it. He often used to hunt in it with\r\nhis women. In brief, in the period of thirty-two years of his reign,\r\nas he had determined, he went against no enemy, and passed this time\r\nin ease and enjoyment. In the same way no one invaded his country. It\r\nis reported that when Shir Khan, the Afghan, in the time of his rule,\r\ncame to the tomb of Nasiru-d-din, he, in spite of his brutish nature,\r\non account of Nasiru-d-din's shameful conduct, ordered the head of the\r\ntomb to be beaten with sticks. Also when I went to his tomb I gave it\r\nseveral kicks, and ordered the servants in attendance on me to kick the\r\ntomb. Not satisfied with this, I ordered the tomb to be broken open and\r\nhis impure remains to be thrown into the fire. Then it occurred to me\r\nthat since fire is Light, it was a pity for the Light of Allah to be\r\npolluted with burning his filthy body; also, lest there should be any\r\ndiminution of torture for him in another state from being thus burnt,\r\nI ordered them to throw his crumbled bones, together with his decayed\r\nlimbs, into the Narbada. During his lifetime he always passed his days\r\nin the water in consequence of the heat that had acquired a mastery\r\nover his temperament. It is well known that in a state of drunkenness\r\nhe once threw himself into one of the basins at Kaliyadaha, which was\r\nvery deep. Some of the attendants in the harem exerted themselves and\r\ncaught his hair in their hands and drew him out of the water. After he\r\nhad come to his senses they told him that this thing had happened. When\r\nhe had heard that they had pulled him out by the hair of his head,\r\nhe became exceedingly angry, and ordered the hands of the attendants\r\nto be cut off. Another time, when an affair of this kind took place,\r\nno one had the boldness to pull him out and he was drowned. By chance,\r\nafter 110 years had passed since his death, it came to pass that his\r\ndecayed limbs also became mingled with the water.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th, as a reward for the buildings of Mandu having been\r\ncompleted through his excellent exertions, I promoted `Abdu-l-Karim\r\nto the rank of 800 personal and 400 horse, and dignified him with\r\nthe title of Ma`mur Khan (the architect-Khan). On the same day\r\nthat the royal standards entered the fort of Mandu, my son of lofty\r\nfortune, Sultan Khurram, with the victorious army, entered the city\r\nof Burhanpur, which is the seat of the governor of the province\r\nof Khandesh.\r\n\r\nAfter some days, representations came from Afzal Khan and the Ray\r\nRayan, to whom at the time of leaving Ajmir my son had given leave\r\nto accompany the ambassador to `Adil Khan, reporting that when the\r\nnews of our coming reached `Adil Khan he came out for 7 kos to meet\r\nthe order and the litter of the prince, and performed the duties of\r\nsalutation and respect which are customary at Court. He did not omit\r\na hair's point of such ceremonies. At the same interview he professed\r\nthe greatest loyalty, and promised that he would restore all those\r\nprovinces that `Ambar of dark fate had taken from the victorious State,\r\nand agreed to send to the Court with all reverence a fitting offering\r\nwith his ambassadors. After saying this he brought the ambassadors\r\nin all dignity to the place that had been prepared for them. On the\r\nsame day he sent some one to `Ambar with a message of the matters\r\nit was necessary to acquaint him with. I heard this news from the\r\nreports of Afzal Khan and the Ray Rayan.\r\n\r\nFrom Ajmir up to Monday, the 23rd of the aforesaid [579] month,\r\nduring four months, 2 tigers, 27 blue bulls, 6 chital (spotted deer),\r\n60 deer, 23 hares and foxes, and 1,200 water-fowl and other animals\r\nhad been killed. On these nights I told the story of my former hunting\r\nexpeditions and the liking I had for this occupation to those standing\r\nat the foot of the throne of the Caliphate. It occurred to me that I\r\nmight make up the account of my game from the commencement of my years\r\nof discretion up to the present time. I accordingly gave orders to the\r\nnews-writers, the hunt-accountants and huntsmen, and others employed\r\nin this service to make enquiries and tell me of all the animals that\r\nhad been killed in hunting. It was shown that from the commencement\r\nof my 12th year, which was in 988 (1580), up to the end of this year,\r\nwhich is the 11th year after my accession and my 50th lunar year,\r\n28,532 head of game had been taken in my presence. Of these, 17,167\r\nanimals I killed myself with my gun or otherwise, viz.: Quadrupeds,\r\n3,203; viz., tigers, 86; bears, cheetahs, foxes, otters (udbilao),\r\nand hyænas, 9; blue bulls, 889; mhaka, a species of antelope, in\r\nsize equal to a blue bull, 35 head; of antelope, male and female,\r\nchikara, chital, mountain goats, etc., 1,670 [580]; rams (quj) and\r\nred deer, 215; wolves, 64; wild buffaloes, 36; pigs, 90; rang, 26;\r\nmountain sheep, 22; arghali, 32; wild asses, 6; hares, 23. Birds,\r\n13,964; viz., pigeons, 10,348; lagarjhagar (a species of hawk), 3;\r\neagles, 2; qaliwaj (ghaliwaj, kite), 23; owls (chughd), 39; qautan\r\n(goldfinch?), 12; kites (mush-khwur, mice-eaters), 5; sparrows, 41;\r\ndoves, 25; owls (bum), 30; ducks, geese, cranes, etc., 150; crows,\r\n3,276. Aquatic animals, 10 magar machha, that is, crocodiles [581]\r\n(nahang).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWELFTH NEW YEAR'S FEAST AFTER MY AUSPICIOUS ACCESSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne ghari of day remained of Monday, the 30th of the aforesaid\r\n(Isfandiyar) month, corresponding to the 12th Rabi`u-l-awwal, 1026\r\n(20th March, 1617), when the sun changed from the constellation of\r\nPisces into the pleasure-house of Aries, which is his abode of honour\r\nand good fortune. At the very time of transit, which was a fortunate\r\nhour, I sat upon the throne. I had ordered that according to the usual\r\ncustom they should decorate the public audience hall with fine cloths,\r\netc. Notwithstanding that many of the Amirs and chief men of the State\r\nwere in attendance on my son Khurram, a meeting was arranged which was\r\nnot inferior to those of previous years. I presented the offerings\r\nof Tuesday [582] to Anand Khan. On the same day, which was the 1st\r\nFarwardin of the 12th year (21st or 22nd March, 1617) a representation\r\narrived from Shah Khurram to the effect that the New Year's festival\r\nhad been arranged for in the same manner as in previous years, but as\r\nthe days of travelling and service had occurred the annual offerings\r\nof the servants would be remitted. This proceeding of my son was much\r\napproved. Remembering my dear son in my prayers, I besought for him\r\nfrom the throne of Allah his welfare in both worlds, and ordered that\r\non this New Year's Day no one should present offerings.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the disturbance that tobacco brings about in most\r\ntemperaments and constitutions, I had ordered that no one should\r\nsmoke it (lit. draw). My brother Shah `Abbas had also become aware\r\nof the mischief arising from it, and had ordered that in Iran no\r\none should venture to smoke. As Khan `Alam (ambassador to Persia)\r\nwas without control in continual smoking of tobacco, he frequently\r\npractised it. Yadgar `Ali Sultan, ambassador of the ruler of Iran,\r\nrepresented to Shah `Abbas that Khan `Alam could never be a moment\r\nwithout tobacco, and he (Shah `Abbas) wrote this couplet in answer--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"The friend's envoy wishes to exhibit tobacco;\r\n    With fidelity's lamp I light up the tobacco-market.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nKhan `Alam in answer wrote and sent this verse--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"I, poor wretch, was miserable at the tobacco notice;\r\n    By the just Shah's favour the tobacco-market became brisk.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of the same month, Husain Beg, the diwan of Bengal,\r\nhad the good fortune to kiss the threshold, and made an offering\r\nof twelve elephants, male and female. Tahir, bakhshi of Bengal, who\r\nhad been accused of several offences, obtained the favour of paying\r\nhis respects to me, and presented before me an offering of twenty-one\r\nelephants. Twelve of these were approved and the remainder I conferred\r\non him. On this day a wine-feast was arranged, and I gave wine to most\r\nof the servants who were engaged in waiting on me, and made them all\r\nheated with the wine of loyalty. On the 4th the huntsmen sent news that\r\nthey had marked down a lion in the neighbourhood of the Shakkar [583]\r\ntank, which is inside the fort and one of the famous constructions of\r\nthe rulers of Malwa. I at once mounted and went towards that game. When\r\nthe lion appeared he charged the ahadis and the retinue and wounded ten\r\n[584] or twelve of them. At last I finished his business with three\r\nshots [585] (lit. arrows) from my gun, and removed his evil from the\r\nservants of God. On the 8th the mansab of Mir Miran, which was 1,000\r\npersonal and 400 horse, was fixed at 1,500 personal and 500 horse. On\r\nthe 9th, at the request of my son Khurram, I increased the mansab of\r\nKhan Jahan by 1,000 personal and horse, making it thus 6,000 personal\r\nand horse; that of Ya`qub Khan, which was 1,500 personal with 1,000\r\nhorse, was made 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse; that of Bahlul Khan\r\nMiyana [586] was increased by 500 personal and 300 horse to 1,500\r\npersonal and 1,000 horse; and that of Mirza Sharafu-d-din Kashghari,\r\nby whom and his son great bravery had been shown in the Deccan, was\r\nincreased to 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse. On the 10th Farwardin,\r\ncorresponding with the 22nd Rabi`u-l-awwal, 1026, my lunar weighing\r\ntook place. On this day two `Iraq horses from my private stable\r\nand a dress of honour were conferred on my son Khurram and sent to\r\nhim by Bahram Beg. I increased the mansab of I`tibar Khan to 5,000\r\npersonal and 3,000 horse. On the 11th, Husain Beg, of Tabriz, whom the\r\nruler of Iran had sent to the ruler of Golconda by way of embassy,\r\nas, in consequence of the quarrel of the Franks with the Persians,\r\nthe road of the Mir had been closed, [587] waited upon me with the\r\nambassador of the ruler of Golconda. Offerings came from him of two\r\nhorses and some tuquz [588] (nine-pieces?) of cloth from the Deccan\r\nand Gujarat. On the same day an `Iraq horse from my private stable\r\nwas bestowed on Khan Jahan. On the 15th, 1,000 personal were added to\r\nthe mansab of Mirza Raja Bhao Singh, raising it to 5,000 personal and\r\n3,000 horse. On the 17th, 500 horse were added to the mansab of Mirza\r\nRustam, and I made it up to 5,000 personal and 1,000 horse; that of\r\nSadiq Khan was fixed at 1,500 personal and 700 horse, original and\r\nincrease; Iradat Khan in the same manner was raised to the mansab\r\nof 1,500 and 600 horse. To the mansab of Anira'i 500 personal and\r\n100 horse were added, and it was made one of 1,500 personal and 500\r\nhorse. Three gharis of Saturday, the 19th, remained when the beginning\r\nof the sharaf (day of sun's culmination) occurred, and at the same time\r\nI again took my seat on the throne. Of the thirty-two prisoners from\r\nthe army of the rebel `Ambar who had been captured by the servants\r\nof the victorious State in the battle won by Shah-nawaz Khan and the\r\ndefeat of that disastrous man (`Ambar), I had handed one man over to\r\nI`tiqad Khan. The guards who had been appointed to keep him showed\r\ncarelessness and let him escape. I was much annoyed at this, and I\r\nforbade I`tiqad Khan to come to wait on me for three months. As the\r\nsaid prisoner's name and condition were unknown, he was not caught\r\nagain, although they showed activity in the matter. At last I ordered\r\nthe captain of the guards who had been careless in keeping him to\r\nbe capitally punished. I`tiqad Khan on this day, at the request of\r\nI`timadu-d-daulah, had the good fortune to pay his respects to me.\r\n\r\nAs for a long time no good had been heard of the affairs of Bengal and\r\nof the conduct of Qasim Khan, it entered my mind to send to the Subah\r\nof Bengal Ibrahim Khan Fath-jang, who had carried on successfully the\r\naffairs of the Subah of Behar and had brought a diamond mine into\r\nthe possession of the State, and to despatch Jahangir Quli Khan,\r\nwho had a jagir in the Subah of Allahabad, in his place to Behar. I\r\nsent for Qasim Khan to Court. At the same hour on the auspicious day\r\n(the day of culmination) an order was given that they should write\r\nroyal farmans to the effect that sazawalan (revenue collectors) should\r\nbe appointed to take Jahangir Quli Khan to Behar and to send Ibrahim\r\nKhan Fath-jang to Bengal. Patronizing Sikandar, [589] the jeweller,\r\nI promoted him to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 300 horse.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st I gave leave to Muhammad Riza, ambassador of the ruler\r\nof Iran, and bestowed on him 60,000 darbs, equal to 30,000 rupees,\r\nwith a dress of honour. As an equivalent to the souvenir (yad-budi)\r\nthat my brother Shah `Abbas had sent to me, I forwarded with the\r\naforesaid ambassador certain presents of jewelled things which the\r\nrulers of the Deccan had sent, with cloths and rare things of every\r\nkind fit for presentation, of the value of 100,000 rupees. Among\r\nthese was a crystal cup that Chelebi [590] had sent from `Iraq. The\r\nShah had seen this cup and said to the ambassador that if his brother\r\n(Jahangir) would drink wine out of it and send it to him it would\r\nbe a great mark of affection. When the ambassador represented this,\r\nhaving drunk wine several times out of the cup in his presence,\r\nI ordered them to make a lid and a saucer for it and sent it along\r\nwith the presents. The lid was of enamel (mina-kari). I ordered the\r\nMunshis of mercurial writing (`Utarid-raqm) to write in due form an\r\nanswer to the letter he had brought.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd the scouts brought in news of a tiger. Mounting\r\nimmediately, I went against the tiger and with three shots I delivered\r\nthe people from his wickedness, and himself from the wickedness of his\r\nvile nature. Masihu-z-zaman produced before me a cat, and represented\r\nthat it was a hermaphrodite, and that in his house it had young ones,\r\nand that when it had connection with another cat, young were born to\r\nthe latter.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th the contingent of I`timadu-d-daulah passed before me in\r\nreview on the plain under the jharoka. There were 2,000 cavalry well\r\nhorsed, most of whom were Moghuls, 500 foot armed with bows and guns,\r\nand fourteen elephants. The bakhshis reckoned them up and reported\r\nthat this force was fully equipped and according to rule. On the 26th\r\na tigress was killed. On Thursday, the 1st Urdibihisht, a diamond that\r\nMuqarrab Khan had sent by runners was laid before me; it weighed 23\r\nsurkh, and the jewellers valued it at 30,000 rupees. It was a diamond\r\nof the first water, and was much approved. I ordered them to make a\r\nring of it. On the 3rd the mansab of Yusuf Khan was, at the request of\r\nBaba Khurram, fixed at 1,000 with 1,500 horse and in the same way the\r\nmansabs of several of the Amirs and mansabdars were increased at his\r\nsuggestion. On the 7th, as the huntsmen had marked down four tigers,\r\nwhen two watches and three gharis had passed I went out to hunt them\r\nwith my ladies. When the tigers came in sight Nur-Jahan Begam submitted\r\nthat if I would order her she herself would kill the tigers with her\r\ngun. I said, \"Let it be so.\" She shot two tigers with one shot each\r\nand knocked over the two others with four shots. In the twinkling of\r\nan eye she deprived of life the bodies of these four tigers. Until\r\nnow such shooting was never seen, that from the top of an elephant and\r\ninside of a howdah (`amari) six shots should be made and not one miss,\r\nso that the four beasts found no opportunity to spring or move. [591]\r\nAs a reward for this good shooting I gave her a pair of bracelets\r\n[592] (pahunchi) of diamonds worth 100,000 rupees and scattered 1,000\r\nashrafis (over her). On the same day Ma`mur Khan (the architect-Khan)\r\nobtained leave to go to Lahore to complete the buildings of the\r\npalace there. On the 10th the death of Sayyid Waris, who was faujdar\r\nof the Subah of Oudh, was reported. On the 12th, as Mir Mahmud asked\r\nfor a faujdarship, I dignified him with the title of Tahawwur Khan,\r\nand, increasing his mansab, appointed him to the faujdarship of\r\nsome of the parganahs of the Subah of Multan. On the 22nd, Tahir,\r\nthe bakhshi of Bengal, who had been forbidden to pay his respects,\r\nwaited upon me and presented his offerings. Eight elephants were also\r\npresented as the offering of Qasim Khan, governor of Bengal, and two\r\nas that of Shaikh Modhu. On the 28th, at the request of Khan Dauran,\r\nan order was given for the increase of the mansab of `Abdu-l-`Aziz\r\nKhan by 500. On the 5th Khurdad the duty of the Diwanship of Gujarat\r\nwas given to Mirza Husain in supercession of Kesho. I dignified him\r\nwith the title of Kifayat Khan. On the 8th, Lashkar Khan, who had\r\nbeen appointed bakhshi of Bangash, came and waited on me; he offered\r\n100 muhrs and 500 rupees. Some days before this Ustad Muhammad Nayi\r\n(flute-player), who was unequalled in his craft, was sent by my son\r\nKhurram at my summons. I had heard some of his musical pieces [593]\r\n(majlis-saz), and he played a tune which he had composed for an ode\r\n(ghazal) in my name. On the 12th I ordered him to be weighed against\r\nrupees; this came to 6,300 rupees. I also gave him an elephant with\r\na howdah, [594] and I ordered him to ride on it and, having packed\r\n[595] his rupees about him, to proceed to his lodging. Mulla Asad,\r\nthe story-teller, one of the servants of Mirza Ghazi, came on the same\r\nday from Tattah and waited on me. As he was a reciter and story-teller\r\nfull of sweetness and smartness, I liked his society, and I made\r\nhim happy with the title of Mahzuz Khan, and gave him 1,000 rupees,\r\na dress of honour, a horse, an elephant, and a palanquin. After some\r\ndays I ordered him to be weighed against rupees, and his weight came up\r\nto 4,400. He was raised to the mansab of 200 personal and 20 horse. I\r\nordered him always to be present at the meetings for talk (gap). On\r\nthe same day Lashkar Khan brought his men to the darshan jharoka before\r\nme. There were 500 horse, 14 elephants, and 100 musketeers. On the 24th\r\nnews came that Maha Singh, grandson of Raja Man Singh, who was entered\r\namong the great officers, had died from excessive wine-drinking at\r\nBalapur in the province of Berar. His father also had died at the age\r\nof 32 [596] from the drinking of wine beyond measure. On the same day\r\nthey had brought to my private fruit-house many mangoes from all parts\r\nof the province of the Deccan, Burhanpur, Gujarat, and the parganahs\r\nof Malwa. Although this province is well known and celebrated for\r\nthe sweetness, freedom from stringiness, and size of its mangoes, and\r\nthere are few mangoes that equal its mangoes--so much so that I often\r\nordered them to be weighed in my presence, when they were shown to\r\ncome to a seer or 1 1/4 seer or even more--yet in sweetness of water\r\nand delicious flavour and digestibility the mangoes of Chapramau,\r\n[597] in the province of Agra, are superior to all the mangoes of\r\nthis province and of all other places in India.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th I sent for my son Baba Khurram a special gold-embroidered\r\nnadiri of a fineness such as had never been produced before in my\r\nestablishment; I ordered the bearer to tell him that as this rarity\r\nhad the speciality that I had worn it on the day I quitted Ajmir for\r\nthe conquest of the Deccan, I had sent it to him. On the same day I\r\nplaced the turban from my own head, just as it was, on the head of\r\nI`timadu-d-daulah, and honoured him with this favour. Three emeralds,\r\na piece of jewelled urbasi, [598] and a ruby signet ring that Mahabat\r\nKhan had sent by way of offering were laid before me. They came to\r\n7,000 rupees in value. On this day, by the mercy and favour of Allah,\r\ncontinued rain fell. Water in Mandu had become very scarce and the\r\npeople were agitated about the matter so that most of the servants had\r\nbeen ordered to go to the bank of the Narbada. There was no expectation\r\nof rain at that season. In consequence of the agitation of the people\r\nI turned by way of supplication to the throne of God, and He in His\r\nmercy and grace gave such rain that in the course of a day and a night\r\ntanks, ponds (birkaha), and rivers became full, and the agitation of\r\nthe people was changed to complete ease. With what tongue can I render\r\nthanks for this favour? On the 1st of Tir a standard was presented\r\nto Wazir Khan. The offering of the Rana, consisting of two horses,\r\na piece of Gujarati cloth, and some jars of pickles and preserves,\r\nwas laid before me. On the 3rd, Mu`azza [599](?) brought news of the\r\ncapture of `Abdu-l-Latif, a descendant of the rulers of Gujarat,\r\nwho had always been the originator of mischief and disturbance in\r\nthat Subah. As his capture was a reason for the contentment of the\r\npeople, praise was given to God, and I ordered Muqarrab Khan to send\r\nhim to Court by one of his mansabdars. Many of the zamindars in the\r\nneighbourhood of Mandu, came and waited on me, and laid offerings\r\nbefore me. On the 8th, Ram Das, son of Raja Raj Singh Kachhwaha, was\r\ngiven the tika of a Raja, and I honoured him with that title. Yadgar\r\nBeg, who was known in Mawara'a-n-nahr (Transoxiana) as Yadgar Qurchi,\r\nand had not been without connection and influence with the ruler of\r\nthat country, came and waited on me. Of all his offerings a white\r\nchina cup on a stand was the most approved. The offering of Bahadur\r\nKhan, governor of Qandahar, consisting of nine horses, nine tuquz of\r\nfine cloth (81 pieces?), two black foxes' skins, and other things,\r\nwas brought before me. Also on this day the Raja of Gadeha, Pem [600]\r\nNarayan, had the good fortune to wait on me, and made an offering\r\nof seven elephants, male and female. On the 10th a horse and dress\r\nof honour were given to Yadgar Qurchi. On the 13th was the feast of\r\nrose-water scattering (gulab-pashan). The rites due to that day were\r\nperformed. Shaikh Maudud Chishti, one of the officers of Bengal,\r\nwas honoured with the title of Chishti Khan, and I presented him\r\nwith a horse. On the 14th, Rawal Samarsi (Samarsimha), son of Rawal\r\nUday Singh, zamindar of Banswala, waited on me; he gave as offering\r\n30,000 rupees, three elephants, a jewelled pan-dan (box for betel),\r\nand a jewelled belt. On the 15th nine diamonds which Ibrahim Khan\r\nFath-jang, the governor of Behar, had sent along with Muhammad Beg\r\nfrom the mine, and from the collections of the zamindars of that place,\r\nwere laid before me. Of these, one weighed 14 1/2 tanks, and was of the\r\nvalue of 100,000 rupees. On the same day Yadgar Qurchi was presented\r\nwith 14,000 darbs, and I promoted him to the mansab of 500 personal\r\nand 300 horse. I fixed the mansab of Tatar Khan, bakawul-begi (chief\r\nsteward), original and increase, at 2,000 personal and 300 horse, and\r\neach of his sons was separately promoted to an increased mansab. At\r\nthe request of Prince Sultan Parwiz, I increased the personal mansab\r\nof Wazir Khan by 500.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th, which was the auspicious day of Thursday, Sayyid\r\n`Abdu-llah Barha, the envoy of my son of good fortune, Baba Khurram,\r\nwaited on me, and presented a letter from that son containing news\r\nof a victory over the provinces of the Deccan. All the chiefs, laying\r\nthe head of duty in the noose of obedience, had consented to service\r\nand humility, and laid before him the keys of forts and strongholds,\r\nespecially the fort of Ahmadnagar. In gratitude for this great favour\r\nand beneficence, placing the head of supplication on the throne of that\r\nGod who requires no return, I opened my lips in thankfulness, and,\r\nhumbling myself, ordered them to beat the drums of rejoicing. Thanks\r\nbe to Allah that a territory that had passed out of hand has come back\r\ninto the possession of the servants of the victorious State, and that\r\nthe seditious, who had been breathing the breath of rebellion and\r\nboasting, have turned towards supplication and weakness, and become\r\ndeliverers of properties and payers of tribute. As this news reached\r\nme through Nur-Jahan Begam, I gave her the parganah of Boda (Toda?),\r\n[601] the revenue of which is 200,000 rupees. Please God, when the\r\nvictorious forces enter the province of the Deccan and its forts, and\r\nthe mind of my excellent son Khurram is satisfied with regard to their\r\npossession, he will bring with the ambassadors such an offering from\r\nthe Deccan as no other king of this age has received. It was ordered\r\nthat he should bring with him the Amirs who were to receive jagirs\r\nin this Subah, in order that they might have the honour of waiting on\r\nme. They will thereafter get leave to depart, and the glorious royal\r\nstandards will return with victory and rejoicing to the capital of\r\nAgra. Some days before the news of this victory reached me, I took\r\none night an augury from the diwan of Khwaja Hafiz as to what would\r\nbe the end of this affair, and this ode turned up--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"The day of absence and night of parting from the friend are o'er.\r\n    I took this augury; the star passed and fulfilment came.\" [602]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the secret tongue (lisanu-l-ghaib) of Hafiz showed such an ending\r\nit gave me a strong hope, and accordingly, after twenty-five days,\r\nthe news of victory arrived. In many of my desires I have resorted\r\nto the Khwaja's diwan, and (generally) the result has coincided with\r\nwhat I found there. It is seldom that the opposite has happened.\r\n\r\nOn the same day I added 1,000 horse to the mansab of Asaf Khan, and\r\nraised it to that of 5,000 personal and horse. At the end of the day\r\nI went with the ladies to look round the building of the Haft Manzar\r\n[603] (seven storeys), and at the beginning of the evening returned\r\nto the palace. This building was founded by a former ruler of Malwa,\r\nSultan Mahmud Khalji. It has seven storeys, and in each storey there\r\nare four chambers (suffa) containing four windows. The height of\r\nthis tower (minar) is 54 1/2 cubits, and its circumference 50 yards\r\n(gaz). There are 171 steps from the ground to the seventh storey. In\r\ngoing and returning I scattered 1,400 rupees. [604]\r\n\r\nOn the 31st I honoured Sayyid `Abdu-llah with the title of Saif Khan,\r\nand having exalted him with a dress of honour, a horse, an elephant,\r\nand a jewelled dagger, gave him leave and sent him to do duty with\r\nmy son of lofty fortune. I also sent by him a ruby of the value of\r\nmore than 30,000 rupees for my son. I did not regard its value, but\r\nas for a long time I used to bind it on my own head, I sent it him by\r\nway of good augury, considering it lucky for him. I appointed Sultan\r\nMahmud, a son-in-law of Khwaja Abu-l-hasan bakhshi, to be bakhshi\r\nand news-writer of the Subah of Behar, and when he took leave I gave\r\nhim an elephant. At the end of the day of Thursday, 5th Amurdad,\r\nI went with the ladies to see the Nil-kund, which is one of the most\r\n[605] pleasant places in the fort of Mandu (Mandogarh). Shah-budagh\r\nKhan, who was one of my revered father's most considerable Amirs, at\r\nthe time when he held this province in jagir, built in this place an\r\nexceedingly pleasing and enjoyable building. Delaying there till two or\r\nthree gharis of night had passed I returned to the auspicious palace.\r\n\r\nAs several indiscretions on the part of Mukhlis Khan diwan and bakhshi\r\nof the Subah of Bengal, had come to my ears, I reduced his mansab\r\nby 1,000 personal and 200 horse. On the 7th a war (masti) elephant\r\nfrom among those sent as offerings by `Adil Khan, by name Gaj-raj,\r\nwas sent to Rana Amr Singh. On the 11th, I went out to hunt and came\r\none stage from the fort. There was excessive rain, and the mud was\r\nsuch that there was hardly any moving. For the convenience of the\r\npeople and the comfort of the animals I gave up this undertaking, and\r\npassing the day of Thursday outside, returned on Friday eve. On the\r\nsame day Hidayatu-llah, who is very well suited to carry out the rules\r\nand movements (in travelling) of the headquarters (lit. presence),\r\nwas honoured with the title of Fida'i Khan. In this rainy season rain\r\nfell in such quantities that old men said that they did not remember\r\nsuch rain in any age. For nearly forty days there was nothing but\r\ncloud and rain, so that the sun only appeared occasionally. There was\r\nso much wind that many buildings, both old and new, fell down. On the\r\nfirst night there was [606] such rain and thunder and lightning as\r\nhas seldom been heard of. Nearly twenty women and men were killed,\r\nand the foundations even of some of the stone buildings were broken\r\nup. No noise is more terrifying than this. Till the middle of the\r\nmonth was passed, wind and rain increased. After this they gradually\r\nbecame less. What can be written of the verdure and self-grown fragrant\r\nplants? They covered valley and plain and hill and desert. It is not\r\nknown if in the inhabited world there exists another such place as\r\nMandu for sweetness of air and for the pleasantness of the locality\r\nand the neighbourhood, especially in the rainy season. In this season,\r\nwhich lasts for months and extends up to the hot weather, one cannot\r\nsleep inside houses without coverlets, and in the day the temperature\r\nis such that there is no need for a fan or for change of place. All\r\nthat could be written would still fall short of the many beauties of\r\nthe place. I saw two things that I had not seen in any other place\r\nin Hindustan. One was the tree of the wild plantain that grows in\r\nmost of the uncultivated places in the fort, and the other the nest\r\nof the wagtail (mamula), which they call in Persian the dum-sicha\r\n(tail-wagger). Up till now none of the hunters had pointed out its\r\nnest. By chance in the building I occupied there was its nest, and\r\nit brought out two young ones.\r\n\r\nThree watches of day had passed on Thursday, the 19th, when I\r\nmounted with the ladies in order to go round and see the courts and\r\nbuildings on the Shakkar tank, founded by former rulers of Malwa. As\r\nan elephant had not been conferred on I`timadu-d-daulah on account of\r\nhis government of the Panjab, I gave him on the road one of my private\r\nelephants of the name of Jagjot. I remained in this enchanting place\r\nuntil the evening, and was much delighted with the pleasantness and\r\ngreenness of the surrounding open spaces. After performing my evening\r\nprayer and counting my rosary, we returned to our fixed residence. On\r\nFriday an elephant named Ran-badal (cloud of war?), which Jahangir\r\nQuli Khan had sent as an offering, was brought before me. Having\r\nadopted for myself certain special cloths and cloth-stuffs, I gave an\r\norder that no one should wear the same but he on whom I might bestow\r\nthem. One was a nadiri coat that they wear over the qaba (a kind of\r\nouter vest). Its length is from the waist down to below the thighs,\r\nand it has no sleeves. It is fastened in front with buttons, and the\r\npeople of Persia call it kurdi (from the country of the Kurds). I\r\ngave it the name of nadiri. Another garment is a Tus shawl, which my\r\nrevered father had adopted as a dress. The next was a coat (qaba)\r\nwith a folded collar (batu giriban). The ends of the sleeves were\r\nembroidered. He had also appropriated this to himself. Another was a\r\nqaba with a border, from which the fringes of cloth were cut off and\r\nsewn round the skirt and collar and the ends of the sleeve. Another\r\nwas a qaba of Gujarati satin, and another a chira and waistbelt woven\r\nwith silk, in which were interwoven gold and silver threads.\r\n\r\nAs the monthly pay of some of Mahabat Khan's horsemen, according\r\nto the regulation of three and two horsed men, for the performance\r\nof duty in the Deccan, had become increased and the service [607]\r\nhad not been performed, I gave an order that the civil officers\r\n(diwaniyan) should levy the difference from his jagir. In the end\r\nof Thursday, the 26th, corresponding with the 14th Sha`ban, which is\r\nthe Shab-i-barat, I held a meeting in one of the houses of the palace\r\nof Nur-Jahan Begam, which was situated in the midst of large tanks,\r\nand summoning the Amirs and courtiers to the feast which had been\r\nprepared by the Begam, I ordered them to give the people cups and all\r\nkinds of intoxicating drinks according to the desire of each. Many\r\nasked for cups, and I ordered that whoever drank a cup should sit\r\naccording to his mansab and condition. All sorts of roast meats, and\r\nfruits by way of relish, were ordered to be placed before everyone. It\r\nwas a wonderful assembly. In the beginning of the evening they lighted\r\nlanterns and lamps all round the tanks and buildings, and a lighting up\r\nwas carried out the like of which has perhaps never been arranged in\r\nany place. The lanterns and lamps cast their reflection on the water,\r\nand it appeared as if the whole surface of the tank was a plain of\r\nfire. A grand entertainment took place, and the drinkers of cups took\r\nmore cups than they could carry.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"A feast was arranged that lighted up the heart,\r\n    It was of such beauty as the heart desired.\r\n    They flung over this verdant mead\r\n    A carpet broad as the field of genius.\r\n    From abundance of perfume the feast spread far,\r\n    The heavens were a musk-bag by reason of incense,\r\n    The delicate ones of the garden (the flowers) became glorious,\r\n    The face of each was lighted up like a lamp.\" [608]\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter three of four gharis of night had passed, I dismissed the men\r\nand summoned the ladies, and till a watch of night (remained?) passed\r\nthe time in this delightful place, and enjoyed myself. On this day of\r\nThursday several special things had happened. One was that it was the\r\nday of my ascension of the throne; secondly, it was the Shab-i-barat,\r\nthirdly, it was the day of the rakhi, which has already been described,\r\nand with the Hindus is a special day. On account of these three pieces\r\nof good fortune I called the day Mubarak-shamba.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th, Sayyid Kasu was dignified with the title of Parwarish\r\nKhan. Wednesday in the same way that Mubarak-shamba had been a\r\nfortunate one for me had fallen out exactly the opposite. On this\r\naccount I gave this evil day the name of Kam-shamba, in order that\r\nthis day might always fail from the world (lessen). On the next day\r\na jewelled dagger was conferred on Yadgar Qurchi, and I ordered that\r\nafter this he should be styled Yadgar Beg. I had sent for Jay Singh,\r\nson of Raja Maha Singh. On this day he waited on me and presented an\r\nelephant as an offering. A watch and three gharis of Mubarak-shamba,\r\nthe 2nd of Shahriyar, had passed, when I rode to look round the\r\nNil-kund and its neighbourhood; thence I passed on to the plain of the\r\n`Id-gah on the top of a mound that was very green and pleasant. Champa\r\nflowers and other sweet wild herbs of that plain had bloomed to such\r\na degree that on all sides on which the eye fell the world looked\r\nlike a world of greenery and flowers. I entered the palace when a\r\nwatch of night had passed.\r\n\r\nAs it had been several times mentioned to me that a kind of sweetmeat\r\nwas obtained from the wild plantain such that dervishes and other poor\r\npeople made it their food, I wished to enquire into the matter. What\r\nI found was that the fruit of the wild plantain was an exceedingly\r\nhard and tasteless thing. The real fact is that in the lower part\r\n(of the trunk) there is a thing shaped like a fir-cone from which\r\nthe real fruit of the plantain comes out. On this a kind of sweetmeat\r\nforms which has exactly the juiciness and taste of paluda. It appears\r\nthat men eat this and enjoy it. [609]\r\n\r\nWith regard to carrier pigeons (kabutar-i-nama-bar), it had been\r\nstated to me in the course of conversation that in the time of the\r\nAbbaside Caliphs they taught [610] the Baghdad pigeons who were styled\r\n'letter-carriers' (nama-bar), and were one-half larger [611] than\r\nthe wild pigeon. I bade the pigeon-fanciers to teach their pigeons,\r\nand they taught some of them in such a manner that we let them fly\r\nfrom Mandu in the early morning, and if there was much rain they\r\nreached Burhanpur by 2 1/2 pahars (watches) of the day, or even in\r\n1 1/2 pahars. If the air was very clear most of them arrived by one\r\npahar of the day and some by four gharis (hours) of the day.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd a letter came from Baba Khurram, announcing the coming\r\nof Afzal Khan and Ray Rayan and the arrival of the ambassadors of\r\n`Adil Khan, and their bringing suitable offerings of jewels, jewelled\r\nthings, elephants, and horses, offerings such as had never come in\r\nany reign or time, and expressing much gratitude for the services\r\nand loyalty of the aforesaid Khan, and his faithfulness to his word\r\nand duty. He asked for a gracious royal firman bestowing on him the\r\ntitle of farzand (son) and for other favours, which had never yet been\r\nvouchsafed in his honour. Since it was very gratifying to me to please\r\nmy son, and his request was reasonable, I ordered that the Munshis of\r\nthe mercurial pen should write a farman in the name of `Adil Khan,\r\nconveying every kind of affection and favour, and exceeding in his\r\npraise ten or twelve times what had been previously written. They\r\nwere ordered in these farmans to address him as farzand. In the body\r\nof the farman I wrote this couplet with my own hand--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Thou'st become, at Shah Khurram's request,\r\n    Renowned in the world as my son\" (farzandi).\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 4th day this farman was sent off with its copy, so that my son\r\nShah Khurram might see the copy and send off the original. On\r\nMubarak-shamba, the 9th, I went with the ladies to the house\r\nof Asaf Khan. His house was situated in the valley, and was\r\nexceedingly pleasant and bright. It had several valleys round\r\nit; in some places there were flowing waterfalls, and mango and\r\nother trees exceedingly green and pleasant and shady. Nearly 200\r\nor 300 keora shrubs (gul-i-keora, Pandanus odoratissimus) grew\r\nin one valley. In fine that day passed in great enjoyment. A\r\nwine party was held and cups were presented to the Amirs and\r\nintimates, and an offering from Asaf Khan was laid before\r\nme. There were many rare things. I took whatever I approved,\r\nand the remainder was given to him. On the same day Khwaja Mir,\r\nson of Sultan Khwaja, who had come on a summons from Bangash,\r\nwaited on me, and presented as an offering a ruby, two pearls,\r\nand an elephant. Raja Bhim Narayan, a zamindar of the province\r\nof Gadeha, was promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 500\r\nhorse. An order was given that a jagir should be provided him\r\nout of his native country. On the 12th a letter came from my son\r\nKhurram that Raja Suraj Mal, son of Raja Baso, whose territory is\r\nnear the fort of Kangra, had promised that in the course of a year\r\nhe would bring that fort into the possession of the servants of\r\nthe victorious State. He also sent his letter which covenanted for\r\nthis. I ordered that after comprehending his desires and wishes,\r\nand satisfying himself with regard to them, he should send off the\r\nRaja to wait on me, so that he might set about the said duty. On\r\nthe same day, which was Monday, the 11th, corresponding with the\r\n1st Ramazan (2nd September, 1617), after four gharis and seven\r\npals had passed, a daughter was born to my son by the mother of\r\nhis other children, who was the daughter of Asaf Khan. This child\r\nwas named Rushanara Begam. As the Zamindar of Jaitpur, which is\r\nin the jurisdiction [612] of Mandu, in consequence of wickedness\r\nhad not had the felicity of kissing the threshold I ordered Fida'i\r\nKhan to proceed against him with some mansabdars and 400 or 500\r\nmusketeers and plunder his country. On the 13th one elephant was\r\ngiven to Fida'i Khan and one to Mir Qasim, son of Sayyid Murad. On\r\nthe 16th Jay Singh, son of Raja Maha Singh, who was 12 years old,\r\nwas promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and horse. To Mir\r\nMiran, son of Mir Khalilu-llah, I gave an elephant which I had\r\nmyself approved, and another to Mulla `Abdu-s-Sattar. [613] Bhoj,\r\nson of Raja Bikramajit Bhadauriya, after his father's death,\r\ncame from the Deccan and waited on me, and presented 100 muhrs\r\nas an offering. On the 17th it was represented that Raja Kalyan\r\nhad come from the province of Orissa, and proposed to kiss my\r\nthreshold. As some unpleasant stories had been told with regard to\r\nhim, an order was given that they should hand him over with his\r\nson to Asaf Khan to enquire into the truth of what had been said\r\nabout him. On the 19th an elephant was given to Jay Singh. On the\r\n20th 200 horses were added to the mansab of Kesho Das Maru, so\r\nthat it came, original and increase, to 2,000 personal and 1,200\r\nhorse. On the 23rd, having distinguished Allah-dad, the Afghan,\r\nwith the title of Rashid Khan, I gave him a parm-narm (shawl). The\r\noffering of Raja Kalyan Singh, consisting of eighteen elephants,\r\nwas brought before me; sixteen elephants were included in my\r\nprivate elephant stud, and I presented him with two. As the news\r\nhad arrived from Iraq of the death of the mother of Mir Miran,\r\ndaughter of Shah Isma`il II, of the race of the Safawi kings,\r\nI sent him a dress of honour and brought him out of the robes\r\nof mourning. On the 25th Fida'i Khan received a dress of honour,\r\nand, in company with his brother Ruhu-llah and other mansabdars,\r\nobtained leave to go to punish the Zamindar of Jaitpur. On the\r\n28th, having come down from the fort with the intention of seeing\r\nthe Narbada and to hunt in its neighbourhood, I took the ladies\r\nwith me and halted two stages down on the bank of the river. As\r\nthere were many mosquitoes and fleas, I did not stay more than one\r\nnight. Having come the next day to Tarapur I returned on Friday,\r\nthe 31st. On the 1st of the month of Mihr, Muhsin Khwaja, who at\r\nthis time had come from Transoxiana, received a dress of honour\r\nand 5,000 rupees. On the 2nd, after enquiry into the matters of\r\nRaja Kalyan, with regard to which a report had been received, and\r\nwhich Asaf Khan had been appointed to investigate, as he appeared\r\ninnocent, he enjoyed the good fortune to kiss the threshold,\r\nand presented as an offering 100 muhrs and 1,000 rupees. His\r\noffering of a string of pearls, consisting of eighty pearls and\r\ntwo rubies with a bracelet with a ruby and two pearls, and the\r\ngolden figure of a horse studded with jewels, was laid before\r\nme. A petition from Fida'i Khan arrived stating that when the\r\nvictorious army entered the province of Jaitpur the zamindar had\r\nelected to run away. He could not oppose Fida'i, and his country\r\nwas ravaged. He now repented of what he had done, and intended\r\nto come to the Court, which was the asylum of the world, and\r\nproffer service and obedience. A force with Ruhu-llah was sent\r\nin pursuit of him to capture and bring him to Court, or to lay\r\nwaste and ruin his domain and imprison his women and dependants,\r\nwho had gone into the country of the neighbouring zamindars. On the\r\n8th Khwaja Nizam came and laid before me fourteen pomegranates from the\r\nport of Mukha (Mocha), which they had brought to Surat in the space of\r\nfourteen days, and in eight days more to Mandu. The size of these was\r\nthe same as that of the Thatta pomegranates. Though the pomegranates of\r\nThatta are seedless and these have seeds, [614] yet they are delicate,\r\nand in freshness excel those of Thatta. On the 9th news came that\r\nwhile Ruhu-llah was passing through the villages, he came to know that\r\nthe women and dependants of the Jaitpuri zamindar were in a certain\r\nvillage. He remained outside, and sent men into the village to make\r\nenquiries and to bring out the persons who were there. Whilst he was\r\nmaking enquiries, one of the devoted servants of the zamindar came\r\nalong with the villagers. Whilst his men were scattered here and there,\r\nand Ruhu-llah with some servants had brought out his furniture and was\r\nsitting on a carpet, that devoted servant came behind him and struck\r\nhim with a spear; the blow was fatal and the spearhead came out at\r\nhis breast. The pulling out of the spear and the reverting [615] to\r\nhis original (dying) of Ruhu-llah took place together. Those who were\r\npresent sent that wretch to hell. All the men who had been scattered\r\nabout put on their armour and attacked the village. Those doomed men\r\n(khun-giriftaha) had the disgrace of harbouring [616] rebels and\r\nsedition-mongers, and were killed in the course of an astronomical\r\nhour. They brought into captivity their wives and daughters, and,\r\nsetting fire to the village, made it so that nothing was seen\r\nbut heaps of ashes. They then lifted up the body of Ruhu-llah and\r\nwent and joined Fida'i Khan. With regard to the bravery and zeal\r\nof Ruhu-llah, there was no dispute; at the most, his carelessness\r\nbrought about this turn of fortune. No traces of habitation remained\r\nin that region; the zamindar of that place went into the hills and\r\njungles and concealed and obliterated himself. He then sent someone\r\nto Fida'i Khan and begged for pardon for his offences. An order was\r\ngiven that he should be allowed quarter and brought to Court.\r\n\r\nThe mansab of Muruwwat Khan was fixed, original and increase, at\r\n2,000 personal and 1,500 horse, on condition that he should destroy\r\nHarbhan, [617] Zamindar of Chandra-kota, from whom travellers endured\r\ngreat annoyance. On the 13th Raja Suraj Mal, together with Taqi, the\r\nbakhshi who was in attendance on Baba Khurram, came and waited on\r\nme. He represented all his requirements. His engagement to perform\r\nthe work was approved, and at the request of my son he was honoured\r\nwith a standard and drums. To Taqi, who had been appointed with him, a\r\njewelled khapwa (dagger) was given, and it was arranged that he should\r\nfinish his own affairs and start off quickly. The mansab of Khwaja `Ali\r\nBeg Mirza, who had been appointed to the defence and administration of\r\nAhmadnagar, was fixed at 5,000 personal and horse. An elephant apiece\r\nwas given to Nuru-d-din Quli, Khwajagi Tahir, Sayyid Khan Muhammad,\r\nMurtaza Khan, and Wali Beg. On the 17th the mansab of Hakim Beg was\r\nfixed, original and increase, at 1,000 personal and 200 horse. On\r\nthe same day, after presenting Raja Suraj Mal with a dress of honour,\r\nan elephant, and a jewelled khapwa, and Taqi with a dress of honour,\r\nI gave them leave to proceed on duty to Kangra. When those who had been\r\nsent by my son of lofty fortune, Shah Khurram, with the ambassadors of\r\n`Adil Khan and his offerings, arrived at Burhanpur, and my son's mind\r\nwas completely satisfied with regard to the affairs of the Deccan,\r\nhe prayed for the Subahdarship of Berar, Khandesh, and Ahmadnagar for\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief, the Khankhanan, and sent his son Shah-nawaz\r\nKhan, who is really Khankhanan junior, with 12,000 cavalry to hold\r\npossession of the conquered provinces. Every place and estate were put\r\nas jagirs into the hands of reliable men, and fitting arrangements\r\nwere made for the government of the province. He left, out of the\r\ntroops that were with him, 30,000 horse and 7,000 musketeer infantry,\r\nand took with him the remainder, amounting to 25,000 horse and 2,000\r\ngunners, and set off to wait on me. On Thursday (Mubarak-shamba), the\r\n20th [618] of the month of Mihr (Divine month), in the twelfth year\r\nfrom my accession, corresponding with the 11th Shawwal, 1026 Hijra\r\n(12th October, 1617), after three watches and one ghari had passed,\r\nhe entered the fort of Mandu auspiciously and joyfully, and had the\r\nhonour of waiting on me. The duration of our separation was 11 [619]\r\nmonths and 11 days. After he had performed the dues of salutation\r\nand kissing the ground, I called him up into the jharokha, and with\r\nexceeding kindness and uncontrolled delight rose from my place and\r\nheld him in the embrace of affection. In proportion as he strove to be\r\nhumble and polite, I increased my favours and kindness to him and made\r\nhim sit near me. He presented 1,000 ashrafis and 1,000 rupees as nazar\r\nand the same amount by way of alms. As the time did not allow of his\r\npresenting all his offerings, he now brought before me the elephant\r\nSarnak (?) (snake-head?), that was the chief of the elephants of\r\n`Adil Khan's offering, with a casket of precious stones. After this\r\nthe bakhshis were ordered to arrange according to their mansabs the\r\nAmirs who had come with my son to pay their respects. The first who\r\nhad the honour of audience was Khan Jahan. Sending for him above,\r\nI selected him for the honour of kissing my feet. He presented 1,000\r\nmuhrs and 1,000 rupees as nazr, and a casket filled with jewels and\r\njewelled things as an offering (pish-kash). What was accepted of his\r\noffering was worth 45,000 rupees. After this `Abdu-llah Khan kissed\r\nthe threshold, and presented 100 muhrs as nazr. Then Mahabat Khan\r\nhad the honour of kissing the ground, and presented an offering of\r\n100 muhrs and 1,000 rupees, with a parcel (gathri) [620] of precious\r\nstones and jewelled vessels, the value of which was 124,000 rupees. Of\r\nthese one ruby weighed 11 miskals; an European brought it last year\r\nto sell at Ajmir, and priced it at 200,000 rupees, but the jewellers\r\nvalued it at 80,000 rupees. Consequently the bargain did not come\r\noff, and it was returned to him and he took it away. When he came to\r\nBurhanpur, Mahabat Khan bought it from him for 100,000 rupees. After\r\nthis Raja Bhao Singh waited on me, presenting 1,000 rupees as nazr\r\nand some jewels and jewelled things as a pish-kash. In the same\r\nmanner Darab Khan, son of the Khankhanan, Sardar Khan, brother of\r\n`Abdu-llah Khan, Shaja`at Khan the Arab, Dayanat Khan, Shah-baz Khan,\r\nMu`tamad Khan bakhshi, Uda Ram, [621] who was one of the chief Amirs\r\nof Nizamu-l-mulk, and who came on the promise of my son Shah Khurram\r\nand joined the ranks of the loyal, waited on me in the order of\r\ntheir mansabs. After this the Wakils of `Adil Khan had the honour\r\nof kissing the ground, and presented a letter from him. Before this,\r\nas a reward for the conquest of the Rana, a mansab of 20,000 personal\r\nand 10,000 horse was conferred on my son of lofty fortune. When he\r\nhad hastened to the capture of the Deccan he had obtained the title\r\nof Shah, and now, in reward for this distinguished service, I gave\r\nhim a mansab of 30,000 personal and 20,000 horse and bestowed on\r\nhim the title of Shah Jahan. An order was given that henceforth they\r\nshould place a chair in the paradise-resembling assemblies near my\r\nthrone for my son to sit upon. This was a special favour for my son,\r\nas it had never been the custom heretofore. A special dress of honour\r\nwith a gold-embroidered charqab, with collar, the end of the sleeves\r\nand the skirt decorated with pearls, worth 50,000 rupees, a jewelled\r\nsword with a jewelled pardala (belt), and a jewelled dagger were\r\nbestowed upon him. In his honour I myself came down from the jharokha\r\nand poured over his head a small tray of jewels and a tray of gold\r\n(coins). [622] Having called Sarnak elephant to me, I saw without\r\ndoubt that what had been heard in its praise and of its beauty was\r\nreal. It stood all the tests in size, form, and beauty. Few elephants\r\nare to be seen of such beauty. As it appeared acceptable to me, I\r\nmyself mounted (i.e. drove it) and took it into my private palace,\r\nand scattered a quantity of gold coins on its head, and ordered them\r\nto tie it up inside the royal palace. With regard to this I gave it\r\nthe name of Nur-bakht [623] (light of fortune). On Friday, the 24th,\r\nRaja Bharjiv, Zamindar of Baglana, came and waited on me. His name is\r\nPartap; every Raja there has been of that place they call Bharjiv. He\r\nhas about 1,500 horse in his pay (mawajib-khwar), and in time of need\r\nhe can bring into the field 3,000 horse. The province of Baglana lies\r\nbetween Gujarat, Khandesh, and the Deccan. It has two strong forts,\r\nSaler and Maler (Muler), and as Maler is in the midst of a populous\r\ncountry he lives there himself. The country of Baglana has pleasant\r\nsprings and running waters. The mangoes of that region are very sweet\r\nand large, and are gathered for nine months from the beginning of\r\nimmaturity [624] until the end. It has many grapes, but not of the\r\nbest kinds. The aforesaid Raja does not drop the thread of caution\r\nand prudence in dealing with the rulers of Gujarat, the Deccan, and\r\nKhandesh. He has never gone himself to see any of them, and if any\r\nof them has wished to stretch out his hand to possess his kingdom,\r\nhe has remained undisturbed through the support of the others. After\r\nthe provinces of Gujarat, the Deccan, and Khandesh came into the\r\npossession of the late king (Akbar), Bharjiv came to Burhanpur\r\nand had the honour of kissing his feet, and after being enrolled\r\namong his servants was raised to the mansab of 3,000. At this time,\r\nwhen Shah Jahan went to Burhanpur, he brought eleven elephants as an\r\noffering. He came to Court in attendance on my son, and in accordance\r\nwith his friendship and service was dignified with royal favours,\r\nand had presented to him a jewelled sword, an elephant, a horse,\r\nand dress of honour. After some days I conferred on him three rings\r\nof jacinth (yaqut), diamond, and ruby. On Mubarak-shamba (Thursday),\r\nthe 27th, Nur-Jahan Begam prepared a feast of victory for my son\r\nShah Jahan, and conferred on him dresses of honour of great price,\r\nwith a nadiri with embroidered flowers, adorned with rare pearls,\r\na sarpich (turban ornament) decorated with rare gems, a turban with\r\na fringe of pearls, a waistbelt studded with pearls, a sword with\r\njewelled pardala (belt), a phul katara (dagger), a sada (?) of pearls,\r\nwith two horses, one of which had a jewelled saddle, and a special\r\nelephant with two females. In the same way she gave his children\r\nand his ladies dresses of honour, tuquz (nine pieces) of cloth with\r\nall sorts of gold ornaments, and to his chief servants as presents\r\na horse, a dress of honour, and a jewelled dagger. The cost of this\r\nentertainment was about 300,000 rupees. Presenting on the same day\r\na horse and dress of honour to `Abdu-llah Khan and Sardar Khan, his\r\nbrother, I gave them leave to go to the Sarkar of Kalpi, which had\r\nbeen given them in jagir, and also dismissed Shaja`at Khan to his\r\njagir, which was in the Subah of Gujarat, with a dress of honour and\r\nan elephant. I dismissed Sayyid Haji, who was a jagirdar of Behar,\r\nwith a gift of a horse.\r\n\r\nIt was frequently reported to me that Khan Dauran had become old and\r\nweak, so as to be unfit for active duty, and the Subahs of Kabul and\r\nBangash is a land of disturbance, and to subdue the Afghans required\r\nriding and active movement. Inasmuch as caution is the condition of\r\nrule, I appointed Mahabat Khan, Subahdar of Kabul and Bangash, giving\r\nhim a dress of honour, and promoted Khan Dauran to the governorship of\r\nthe province of Thatta. Ibrahim Khan Fath-jang had sent as an offering\r\nfrom Behar forty-nine elephants; these were submitted to me. On this\r\nday they brought some sona-kela (golden plantains, bananas) for me. I\r\nhad never eaten such plantains before. In size they are one finger,\r\nand are very sweet and of good flavour; they have no resemblance to\r\nplantains of other descriptions, but are somewhat indigestible, so\r\nthat from the two that I ate I experienced heaviness, whilst others\r\nsay they can eat as many as seven or eight. Though plantains are\r\nreally unfit to eat, yet of all the kinds this is the one fit to\r\neat. This year, up to the 23rd of the month of Mihr, Muqarrab Khan\r\nsent Gujarat mangoes by post (dak-chauki).\r\n\r\nOn this date I heard that Muhammad Riza, ambassador of my brother Shah\r\n`Abbas, gave up the deposit of his life at Agra through the disease\r\nof ishal (diarrhoea). I made the merchant Muhammad Qasim, who had come\r\nfrom my brother, his executor, and ordered that according to the will\r\nhe should convey his goods and chattels to the Shah, so that he might\r\ngrant them in his own presence to the heirs of the deceased. Elephants\r\nand dresses of honour were conferred on Sayyid Kabir and Bakhtar Khan,\r\nWakils of `Adil Khan. On Mubarak-shamba, the 13th Aban, Jahangir Quli\r\nBeg, Turkman, who is dignified with the title of Jan-sipar Khan, came\r\nfrom the Deccan and waited on me. His father was included among the\r\nAmirs of Iran. He had come from Persia in the time of the late king\r\nAkbar, and having a mansab conferred on him was sent to the Deccan. He\r\nwas brought up in that Subah. Although he had been appointed to a\r\nduty, yet as my son Shah Jahan came at this time to pay his respects\r\nand represented his sincerity and devotion, I ordered that he should\r\ncome post to Court and have the good fortune to wait upon me and then\r\nreturn. On this day I promoted Uda Ram [625] to the rank of 3,000\r\npersonal and 1,500 horse. He is a brahmin by caste, and was much relied\r\non by `Ambar. At the time when Shah-nawaz Khan went against `Ambar,\r\nAdam Khan Habshi, Jadu Ray, Babu Ray Kayath, Uda Ram, and some other\r\nSardars of Nizamu-l-mulk left him and came to Shah-nawaz Khan. After\r\n`Ambar's defeat they, by the persuasions of `Adil Khan and the deceit\r\nof `Ambar, left the right road again and gave up their loyalty and\r\nservice. `Ambar took an oath on the Koran to Adam Khan and put him\r\noff his guard, and, capturing him deceitfully, imprisoned him in the\r\nfort of Daulatabad, and at last killed him. Babu Ray Kayath and Uda\r\nRam came away and went to the borders of `Adil Khan's dominions, but\r\nhe would not admit them into his territory. About that time Babu Ray\r\nKayath lost his life (lit. played away the coin of existence) by the\r\ndeceit of his intimates, and `Ambar sent a force against Uda Ram. He\r\nfought well and defeated `Ambar's army. But afterwards, as he could\r\nnot remain in that country, he threw himself on to the borders of\r\nthe royal dominions, and, having got a promise, came with his family\r\nand dependants and entered the service of my son Shah Jahan. That son\r\ndistinguished him with favours and kindnesses of all sorts, and made\r\nhim hopeful by giving him a mansab of 3,000 personal and 1,000 horse,\r\nand brought him to Court. As he was a useful servant, I increased\r\nthis by 500 horse. I also increased the mansab of Shah-baz Khan,\r\nwho had one of 2,000 personal and 1,500 horse, by 500 more horse,\r\nand gave him the faujdarship of the Sarkar of Sarangpur and a part of\r\nthe Subah of Malwa. A special horse and elephant were given to Khan\r\nJahan. On Mubarak-shamba (Thursday), the 10th of the month, my son Shah\r\nJahan produced his own offerings--jewels and jewelled things and fine\r\ncloths and other rare things. These were all laid out in the courtyard\r\nof the jharokha, and arranged together with the horses and elephants\r\nadorned with gold and silver trappings. In order to please him I came\r\ndown from the jharokha and looked through them in detail. Among all\r\nthese there was a fine ruby they had bought for my son at the port of\r\nGoa for 200,000 rupees; its weight was 19 1/2 tanks, or 17 miskals,\r\nand 5 1/2 surkhs. There was no ruby in my establishment over 12 tanks,\r\nand the jewellers agreed to this valuation. Another was a sapphire,\r\namong the offerings of `Adil Khan; it weighed 6 tanks and 7 surkhs\r\nand was valued at 100,000 rupees. I never before saw a sapphire\r\nof such a size and good colour. Another was the Chamkora diamond,\r\nalso of `Adil Khan's; its weight was 1 tank and 6 surkhs, which they\r\nvalued at 40,000 rupees. The name of Chamkora is derived from this,\r\nthat there is in the Deccan a plant called sag-i-chamkora. [626]\r\nAt the time when Murtaza Nizamu-l-mulk conquered Berar he had gone\r\none day with his ladies round to look at the garden, when one of\r\nthe women found the diamond in a chamkora vegetable, and took it to\r\nNizamu-l-mulk. From that day it became known as the Chamkora diamond,\r\nand came into the possession of the present Ibrahim `Adil Khan during\r\nthe interregnum (fatarat) of Ahmadnagar. Another was an emerald,\r\nalso among `Adil Khan's offerings. Although it is from a new mine,\r\nit is of such a beautiful colour and delicacy as I have never before\r\nseen. Again, there were two pearls, one of the weight of 64 surkhs, or\r\n2 miskals and 11 surkhs, and it was valued at 25,000 rupees. The other\r\nweighed 16 surkhs, and was of exceeding roundness and fineness. It was\r\nvalued at 12,000 rupees. Another was a diamond from the offerings of\r\nQutbu-l-mull, in weight 1 tank, and valued at 30,000 rupees. There were\r\n150 elephants, out of which three had gold trappings, chains, etc.,\r\nand nine had silver trappings. Though twenty [627] elephants were put\r\ninto my private stud, five were very large and celebrated. The first,\r\nNur-bakht, which my son presented on the day of meeting, was worth\r\n125,000 rupees. The second, Mahipati, [628] from the offerings of\r\n`Adil Khan, was valued at 100,000 rupees; I gave it the name of\r\nDurjansal. Another, also from his offerings, was Bakht-buland, and\r\nvalued at 100,000 rupees; I called it Giran-bar. Another was Qaddus\r\nKhan, and the fifth was Imam Riza. They were from the offerings of\r\nQutbu-l-mulk. Each of the two was valued at 100,000 rupees. Again,\r\nthere were 100 Arab and Iraq horses, most of which were good horses. Of\r\nthese, three had jewelled saddles. If the private offerings of my\r\nson and those of the rulers of the Deccan were to be written down\r\nin detail, it would be too long a business. What I accepted of his\r\npresents was worth 2,000,000 rupees. In addition to this he gave his\r\n(step-)mother, [629] Nur-Jahan Begam, offerings worth 200,000 rupees,\r\nand 60,000 rupees to his other mothers and the Begams. Altogether my\r\nson's offerings came to 2,260,000 rupees, or 75,000 tumans of the\r\ncurrency of Iran or 6,780,000 current Turan-khanis. Such offerings\r\nhad never been made during this dynasty. I showed him much attention\r\nand favour; in fact, he is a son who is worth grace and kindness. I\r\nam very pleased and satisfied with him. May God Almighty allow him\r\nto enjoy long life and prosperity!\r\n\r\nAs I had never in my life had any elephant-hunting, and had a great\r\ndesire to see the province of Gujarat and to look on the salt sea,\r\nand my huntsmen had often gone and seen wild elephants and fixed on\r\nhunting-places, it occurred to me to travel through Ahmadabad and\r\nlook on the sea, and having hunted elephants on my return, when it\r\nwas hot and the season for hunting them to go back to Agra. With this\r\nintention I despatched to Agra Hazrat Maryamu-z-zaman (his mother)\r\nand the other Begams and people of the harem with the baggage and\r\nextra establishments, and betook myself to a tour in the Subah of\r\nGujarat to hunt, with such as were indispensable with me. On the eve\r\nof Friday in the month of Aban (precise date not given, but apparently\r\nthe 10th), I marched auspiciously and happily from Mandu, and pitched\r\non the bank of the tank of Nalchha. In the morning I went out to\r\nhunt and killed a blue bull with my gun. On the eve of Saturday,\r\nMahabat Khan was presented with a special horse and an elephant,\r\nand obtained leave to go to his Subah of Kabul and Bangash. At his\r\nrequest I conferred on Rashid Khan a robe of honour, a horse, an\r\nelephant, and a jewelled dagger, and appointed him to assist him. I\r\npromoted Ibrahim Husain to the post of bakhshi in the Deccan, and\r\nMirak Husain to that of news-writer in the same Subah. Raja Kalyan,\r\n[630] son of Raja Todar Mal, had come from the Subah of Orissa; on\r\naccount of some faults which had been attributed to him he had for some\r\ndays been forbidden the honour of paying his respects. After enquiry\r\nhis innocence appeared clear, and having given him a dress of honour\r\nand a horse, I appointed him to do duty together with Mahabat Khan in\r\nBangash. On Monday I gave the Wakils of `Adil Khan jewelled turban\r\nfringes after the fashion of the Deccan, one of the value of 5,000\r\nrupees and the other worth 4,000 rupees. As Afzal Khan and Ray Rayan\r\nhad performed the duties of Wakils to my son Shah Jahan in a becoming\r\nmanner, I raised them both in mansab and honoured Ray Rayan with the\r\ntitle of Bikramajit, which among Hindus is the highest title. In\r\ntruth he is a servant worthy of patronage. On Saturday, the 12th,\r\nI went to hunt and shot two female nilgaw. As the hunting-ground was\r\na long way from this halting-place, I on Monday marched 4 1/2 kos\r\n[631] and pitched at the village of Kaid Hasan. On Tuesday, the\r\n15th, I killed three blue bulls, the larger one of which weighed\r\n12 maunds. On this day Mirza Rustam escaped a great danger. [632]\r\nIt seems that he had taken aim at a mark and fired his gun. Then he\r\nreloaded, and as his bullet was very flexible, he rested the gun on\r\nhis chest and put the bullet between his teeth in order that he might\r\ncontract it and put it right. By chance the match reached the pan,\r\nand his chest at the place where the gun was resting was burnt to the\r\nextent of the palm of the hand, and the grains of powder got into his\r\nskin and flesh and a wound was made, and he suffered much pain. [633]\r\n\r\nOn Sunday (?), the 16th, [634] four nilgaw were killed, three females\r\nand one bukra [635] nilgaw. On Mubarak-shamba (Thursday) I went to look\r\nround a hill valley in which there was a waterfall near the camp. At\r\nthis season it had but little water, but as for two or three days\r\nthey had dammed the watercourse and, about the time of my reaching\r\nthe place, let it loose, it flowed over very well. Its height might\r\nbe 20 gaz. It separates at the top of the hill and flows down. In\r\nthis way it is a great boon (ghanimat) on the road. Having enjoyed\r\nthe usual cups on the edge of the stream and the shade of the hill,\r\nI came back to the camp at night. On this day the Zamindar of Jaitpur,\r\nwhose offences I had forgiven at the request of my son Shah Jahan,\r\nhad the good fortune of kissing the threshold. On Friday, the 18th,\r\na large blue bull and a bukra, and on Saturday, the 19th, two females,\r\nwere killed. As my huntsmen represented that there was much game in\r\nthe parganah of Hasilpur, I left my large camp at this halting-place,\r\nand on Sunday, the 20th, and with some of my close attendants,\r\nhastened to Hasilpur, a distance of 3 kos. Mir Husamu-d-din, son of\r\nMir Jamalu-d-din Husain Inju, who has the title of `Azudu-d-daulah,\r\nwas promoted to the mansab, original and increase, of 1,000 personal\r\nand 400 horse. I presented Yadgar Husain Qush-begi and Yadgar Qurchi,\r\nwho had been appointed to do duty in Bangash, with an elephant each. On\r\nthis day some Husaini grapes without seeds arrived from Kabul; they\r\nwere very fresh. The tongue of this suppliant at the throne of God\r\nfails in gratitude for the favours by which, notwithstanding a distance\r\nof three months, grapes from Kabul arrive quite fresh in the Deccan. On\r\nMonday, the 21st, three small blue bulls, on Tuesday, the 22nd, one\r\nblue bull and three cows, and on Kam-shamba (Wednesday), the 23rd,\r\none cow, were killed. On Mubarak-shamba, the 24th, a feast of cups was\r\nheld on the bank of the tank of Hasilpur. Cups were presented to my\r\nson Shah Jahan and some of the great Amirs and private servants. On\r\nYusuf Khan, son of Husain Khan (Tukriyah), who was of the houseborn\r\nones worthy of patronage, was bestowed the mansab of 3,000 personal\r\nand 1,500 horse, original and increase, and he was dismissed to the\r\nfaujdarship of Gondwana, dignifying him with a gift of a dress of\r\nhonour and an elephant. Ray Bihari Das, the diwan of the Subah of the\r\nDeccan, had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. On Friday Jan-sipar\r\nKhan was exalted with a standard, presented with a horse and a dress\r\nof honour, and despatched to the Deccan. This day I made a remarkable\r\nshot with a gun. By chance there was inside the palace a khirni tree\r\n(Mimusops Kauki). A qurisha [636] (?) came and sat on a high branch,\r\nand I saw its breast in the midst of it. I fired at it and struck it in\r\nthe middle of its breast; from where I stood to the top of the branch\r\nwas 22 gaz. On Saturday, the 26th, marching about 2 kos, I pitched\r\nat the village of Kamalpur. On this day I shot a blue bull. [637]\r\nRustam Khan, who was one of the principal attendants of my son Shah\r\nJahan, and who had been appointed from Burhanpur with a body of the\r\nroyal servants against the zamindars of Gondwana, having taken a\r\ntribute of 110 elephants and 120,000 rupees, came this day to wait\r\nupon me. Zahid, son of Shaja`at Khan, was given the mansab of 1,000\r\npersonal and 400 horse, original and increase. On Sunday, the 27th,\r\nI hunted with hawks and falcons. On Monday I killed a large blue bull\r\nand a bukra; the bull weighed 12 1/2 maunds. On Tuesday, the 29th,\r\na blue bull was killed. Bahlul Miyana and Allah-yar came from service\r\nin Gondwana, and had the good fortune to wait upon me. Bahlul Khan\r\nis the son of Hasan Miyana, and Miyana is an Afghan tribe. In the\r\ncommencement of his career Hasan was a servant of Sadiq Khan, but a\r\nservant who recognized the king (worthy of a king's service), and was\r\nat last included among the royal servants and died on service in the\r\nDeccan. After his death his sons were granted mansabs. He had eight\r\nsons, and two of them became famous as swordsmen. The elder brother\r\nin his youth gave up the deposit of his life. Bahlul by degrees was\r\npromoted to the mansab of 1,000. At this time my son Shah Jahan arrived\r\nat Burhanpur, and, finding him worthy of patronage, made him hopeful\r\nwith a mansab of 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse. As he had not yet\r\nwaited on me and was very desirous to kiss the threshold, I summoned\r\nhim to Court. He is in truth a good Khana-zada (household-born one),\r\ninasmuch as his heart is adorned with the perfection of bravery\r\nand his exterior is not wanting in good appearance. The mansab my\r\nson Shah Jahan had bespoken for him was granted at his request, and\r\nhe was honoured with the title of Sar-buland Khan. Allah-yar Koka\r\nwas also a brave youth and a servant worthy of patronage. Finding\r\nhim fit and suitable for service in my presence, I sent for him to\r\nCourt. On Kam-shamba (Wednesday), the 1st of the month of Azar, I\r\nwent out to hunt and shot a blue bull. On this day the Kashmir [638]\r\nreports were laid before me. One was that in the house of a certain\r\nsilk-seller two girls were born with teeth, and with their backs as\r\nfar as the waist joined together, but the heads, arms, and legs were\r\nseparate; they lived a short time and died. On Mubarak-shamba, the\r\n2nd, on the bank of a tank where my tents were, a feast of cups was\r\nheld. Presenting Lashkar Khan with a dress of honour and an elephant,\r\nI promoted him to the duty of diwan of the Subah of the Deccan, and\r\ngave him the mansab of 2,500 personal and 1,500 horse, original and\r\nincrease. To each of the Wakils of `Adil Khan two [639] kaukab-i-tali`\r\n(horoscope star) muhrs, the weight of each of which was 500 ordinary\r\nmuhrs, were given. I gave a horse and robe of honour to Sar-buland\r\nKhan. As fitting service and approved activity were manifest in\r\nAllah-yar Koka, I honoured him with the title of Himmat Khan and\r\ngave him a dress of honour. On Friday, the 3rd, I marched 4 1/4 kos\r\nand halted the royal standards in the parganah of Dikhtan. [640] On\r\nSaturday also I marched 4 1/4 kos and halted at the township of Dhar.\r\n\r\nDhar is one of the old cities, and Raja Bhoj, who was one of the\r\ngreat Rajas of Hindustan, lived in it. From his time 1,000 [641]\r\nyears have passed, and in the time of the Sultans of Malwa it was\r\nfor a long time the capital. At the time when Sultan Muhammad Tughluq\r\nwas proceeding to the conquest of the Deccan, he built a fort of cut\r\nstone on the top of a ridge. Outside it is very showy and handsome,\r\nbut inside the fort is devoid of buildings. I ordered them to measure\r\nits length, breadth, and height. The length inside the fort was 12\r\ntanab, 7 gaz; the breadth, 17 tanab, 13 gaz, and the breadth of the\r\nfort wall 19 1/2 gaz. Its height up to the battlements appeared to\r\nbe 17 1/2 gaz. The length of the outer circuit (?) of the fort was\r\n55 tanabs. `Amid Shah Ghori, who was called Dilawar Khan, and who\r\nin the time of Sultan Muhammad, son of Sultan Firuz, king of Delhi,\r\nhad complete authority over the province of Malwa, built the Jami`\r\nmosque in the inhabitable part outside the fort, and opposite the gate\r\nof the mosque fixed a quadrangular iron column. When Sultan Bahadur\r\nof Gujarat took the province of Malwa into his own possession, he\r\nwished to transfer this column to Gujarat. The artificers did not\r\ntake proper precautions when they lowered it, and it fell and broke\r\ninto two pieces, one of them of 7 1/2 gaz and the other of 4 1/4\r\ngaz. The column was 1 1/4 gaz round. As it was lying there useless,\r\nI ordered them to take the larger piece to Agra and put [642] it up in\r\nthe courtyard of the mausoleum of H.M. Akbar, and to burn a lamp on\r\nthe top of it at night. The aforesaid mosque has two gates. In front\r\nof the arch of one gate some sentences in prose have been carved on\r\na stone tablet; their purport is that Amid Shah Ghori founded this\r\nmosque in the year 870, [643] and on the arch of the other gate a\r\nqasida has been written, and these few couplets are from it--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"The lord of the age the star of the sphere of glory,\r\n    Centre of the people of the earth, sun of the zenith of perfection,\r\n    Asylum and support of religious law, `Amid Shah Da'ud, [644]\r\n    In whose excellent qualities Ghor glories,\r\n    Helper and protector of the Faith of the Prophet, Dilawar Khan,\r\n    Who has been chosen by the most mighty Lord (God),\r\n    Founded the Jami` mosque in the city of Dhar,\r\n    At a fortunate, auspicious time, on a day of happy omen.\r\n    The date of eight hundred and seven [645] had passed\r\n    When the Court of hopes was completed by Fortune.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Dilawar Khan gave up the deposit of his life there was\r\nno king with full dominion over Hindustan, and it was a time of\r\nconfusion. Hushang, son of Dilawar Khan, who was just and possessed\r\nof courage, seeing his opportunity, sat on the throne of sovereignty\r\nin Malwa. After his death through destiny the rule was transferred\r\n[646] to Mahmud Khalji, son of Khan Jahan, who had been Vizier to\r\nHushang and passed from him to his son Ghiyasu-d-din, and after him to\r\nNasiru-d-din, son of Ghiyasu-d-din, who gave his father poison and sat\r\non the throne of infamy. From him it passed to his son Mahmud. Sultan\r\nBahadur of Gujarat took from Mahmud the province of Malwa. The\r\nsuccession of kings of Malwa ended with the aforesaid Mahmud.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 6th, I went to hunt and shot a female nilgaw. Presenting\r\nan elephant to Mirza Sharafu-d-din Husain Kashghari, I dismissed him\r\nto duty in the Subah of Bangash. A present of a jewelled dagger, a\r\nmuhr of 100 tolas, and 20,000 darbs was made to Uda Ram. On Tuesday,\r\nthe 7th, I shot an alligator in the tank at Dhar. Though only the\r\ntop of his snout was visible and the rest of his body was hidden in\r\nthe water, I fired at a guess and hit him in his lungs and killed\r\nhim with a single shot. An alligator is of the crocodile species and\r\nexists in most of the rivers of Hindustan, and grows very large. This\r\none was not so very big. An alligator has been seen (by me) 8 gaz\r\nlong and 1 gaz in breadth. On Sunday, marching 4 1/2 kos, I halted at\r\nSa`dalpur. In this village there is a stream over which Nasiru-d-din\r\nKhalji built a bridge and erected buildings. It is a place like\r\nKaliyada, and both are his works. Although his building is not worthy\r\nof praise, yet as it has been built in the river-bed and they have\r\nmade rivulets and reservoirs, it is somewhat remarkable. At night\r\nI ordered them to place lamps all round the canals and streams. On\r\nMubarak-shamba (Thursday), the 9th, a feast of cups was held. On this\r\nday I made a present to my son Shah Jahan of a ruby of one colour,\r\nweighing 9 tanks and 5 surkh, of the value of 125,000 rupees, with\r\ntwo pearls. This is the ruby which had been given to my father at\r\nthe time of my birth by Hazrat Maryam-makani, mother of H.M. Akbar,\r\nby way of present when my face was shown, and was for many years in\r\nhis sarpich (turban ornament). After him I also happily wore it in\r\nmy sarpich. Apart from its value and delicacy, as it had come down\r\nas of auspicious augury to the everlasting State, it was bestowed\r\non my son. Having raised Mubariz Khan to a mansab of 1,500 personal\r\nand horse, I appointed him to the faujdarship of the province of\r\nMewat, distinguishing him with the present of a dress of honour,\r\na sword, and an elephant. A sword was given to Himmat Khan, son of\r\nRustam Khan. I gave Kamal Khan, the huntsman, who is one of the old\r\nservants and is always present with me on hunting expeditions, the\r\ntitle of Shikar Khan (hunting-Khan). Appointing Uda Ram to service\r\nin the Subah of the Deccan, I conferred on him a dress of honour,\r\nan elephant, and Iraq horses (lit. wind-footed ones), and sent with\r\nhim for the Commander-in-Chief, Khankhanan, the Ataliq, a special gilt\r\ndagger (zar-nishan). On Friday, the 10th, I halted. On Saturday, the\r\n11th, I marched 3 3/4 kos and halted at the village of Halwat. [647]\r\nOn Sunday, the 12th, marching 5 kos, I halted in the parganah [648]\r\nof Badnor. This parganah from the time of my father had been in the\r\njagir of Kesho Das Maru, [649] and in fact had become a kind of watan\r\n(native country) to him. He had constructed gardens and buildings. Out\r\nof these one was a well (baoli) (step-well probably) on the road,\r\nwhich appeared exceedingly pleasant and well made. It occurred to\r\nme that if a well had to be made anywhere on a roadside it should be\r\nbuilt like this one. At least two such ought to be made.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 13th, I went to hunt and shot a blue bull. From the\r\nday on which the elephant Nur-bakht was put into the special elephant\r\nstables, there was an order that he should be tied up in the public\r\npalace (court). Among animals elephants have the greatest liking\r\nfor water; they delight to go into the water, notwithstanding the\r\nwinter and the coldness of the air, and if there should be no water\r\ninto which they can go, they will take it from a water-bag (mashk)\r\nwith their trunks and pour it over their bodies. It occurred to me\r\nthat however much an elephant delights in water, and it is suited to\r\ntheir temperament, yet in the winter the cold water must affect them. I\r\naccordingly ordered the water to be made lukewarm (as warm as milk)\r\nbefore they (the elephants) poured it into their trunks. On other days\r\nwhen they poured cold water over themselves they evidently shivered,\r\nbut with warm water, on the contrary they were delighted. This usage\r\nis entirely my own.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the 14th, marching 6 kos, I halted at Silgarh (Sabalgarh\r\n?). On Wednesday, the 15th, crossing the Mahi River, a halt was made\r\nnear Ramgarh. A march of 6 kos was made on Thursday, the 16th, and\r\na halt was made and a feast of cups held at a waterfall near the\r\ncamp. Distinguishing Sar-buland Khan with a standard and giving\r\nhim an elephant, I dismissed him to do duty in the Deccan. His\r\nmansab, original and increase, was fixed at 1,500 personal and 1,200\r\nhorse. Raja Bhim Narayan, Zamindar of Gadeha, who had been promoted to\r\nthe mansab of 1,000 horse, obtained leave to go to his jagir. Having\r\nraised Raja Bharjiv, Zamindar of Baglana, to the mansab of 4,000,\r\nI gave him leave to go to his native country, and an order was given\r\nthat when he arrived there he should send to Court his eldest son, who\r\nwas his successor, that he might do duty in my presence. I honoured\r\nHaji Baluch, who was the chief of the huntsmen and was an active\r\nand old servant, with the title of Baluch Khan. On Friday, the 17th,\r\nmarching 5 kos, I alighted at the village of Dhavala. On Saturday,\r\nthe 18th, which was the feast of Qurban, after the Qurban rites had\r\nbeen performed, marching 3 1/4 kos, I halted on the bank of the tank\r\nof the village of Nagor. [650] On Sunday, the 19th, marching about\r\n5 kos, the royal standards were erected on the bank of the tank of\r\nthe village of Samriya. On Monday, the 20th, marching 4 1/4 kos, we\r\nalighted at the chief place of the Dohad [651] parganah. This parganah\r\nis on the boundary between Malwa and Gujarat. Until I passed Badnor\r\nthe whole country was a jungle, with an abundance of trees and stony\r\nland. On Tuesday, the 21st, I halted. On Kam-shamba (Wednesday), the\r\n22nd, marching 5 1/4 kos, I halted at the village of Ranyad (Renav\r\n?). On Thursday, the 23rd, I halted and held a feast of cups on the\r\nbank of the village tank. On Friday, the 24th, marching 2 1/2 kos,\r\nthe royal standards were hoisted at the village of Jalot. At this halt\r\nsome jugglers from the Carnatic came and showed their tricks. One of\r\nthem placed one end of an iron chain, 5 1/2 gaz in length and weighing\r\n1 seer and 2 dams, [652] in his throat and slowly swallowed it with\r\nthe aid of water. It was for a while in his stomach; after this he\r\nbrought it up. On Saturday, the 25th, there was a halt. On Sunday,\r\nthe 26th, marching 5 kos, I alighted at the village of Nimdah. On\r\nMonday, the 27th, also marching 5 kos, I pitched on the bank of a\r\ntank. On Tuesday, the 28th, marching 3 3/4 kos, the royal standards\r\nalighted near the township of Sahra [653] on the edge of a tank. The\r\nflower of the lotus, which in the Hindi language they call kumudini,\r\nis of three colours--white, blue, and red. I had already seen the blue\r\nand white, but had never seen the red. In this tank red flowers were\r\nseen blooming. Without doubt it is an exquisite and delightful flower,\r\nas they have said--\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"From redness and moistness it will melt away.\" [654]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flower of the kanwal [655] is larger than the kumudini. Its flower\r\nis red. I have seen in Kashmir many kanwal with a hundred leaves\r\n(petals). It is certain that it opens during the day and becomes a\r\nbud at night. The kumudini, on the contrary, is a bud during the day\r\nand opens at night. The black bee, which the people of India call\r\nbhaunra, always sits on these flowers, and goes inside them to drink\r\nthe juice that is in both of them. It often happens that the kanwal\r\nflower closes and the bee remains in it the whole night. In the same\r\nmanner it remains in the kumudini flower. When the flower opens it\r\ncomes out and flies away. As the black bee is a constant attendant on\r\nthese flowers, the poets of India look on it as a lover of the flower,\r\nlike the nightingale, and have put into verse sublime descriptions of\r\nit. Of these poets the chief was Tan Sen Kalawant, who was without a\r\nrival in my father's service (in fact, there has been no singer like\r\nhim in any time or age). In one of his compositions he has likened\r\nthe face of a young man to the sun and the opening of his eyes to the\r\nexpanding of the kanwal and the exit of the bee. In another place he\r\nhas compared the side-glance of the beloved one to the motion of the\r\nkanwal when the bee alights on it.\r\n\r\nAt this place figs arrived from Ahmadabad. Although the figs of\r\nBurhanpur are sweet and well-grown, these figs are sweeter and with\r\nfewer seeds, and one may call them 5 per cent. better. On Kam-shamba,\r\nthe 29th, and Mubarak-shamba, the 30th, we halted. At this stage\r\nSar-faraz Khan came from Ahmadabad and had the good fortune to kiss the\r\nthreshold. Out of his offerings a rosary of pearls, bought for 11,000\r\nrupees, two elephants, two horses, two bullocks and a riding cart,\r\nand some pieces of Gujarati cloth, were accepted, and the remainder\r\npresented to him. Sar-faraz Khan is a grandson of Musahib Beg, by which\r\nname he was called by Akbar after his grandfather, who was one of the\r\nAmirs of Humayun. In the beginning of my reign I increased his mansab\r\nand appointed him to the Subah of Gujarat. As he had an hereditary\r\nconnection with the Court as a Khana-zada (one born in the house),\r\nhe proved himself efficient in the Subah of Gujarat. Considering\r\nhim worthy of patronage, I gave him the title of Sar-faraz Khan and\r\nraised him in the world, and his mansab has risen to 2,000 personal\r\nand 1,000 horse. On Friday, the 1st of Day, I marched 3 3/4 kos and\r\nhalted on the bank of the tank of Jhasod. [656] At this stage Ray Man,\r\ncaptain of the Khidmatiya, [657] caught a rohu fish and brought it. As\r\nI am particularly partial to the flesh of fish, especially that of the\r\nrohu, which is the best kind of fish in Hindustan, and I had never,\r\nnotwithstanding much enquiry, had one for eleven months from the time\r\nof crossing the pass of Ghati Chand [658] until the present time, and\r\nnow obtained it, I was greatly delighted. I presented a horse to Ray\r\nMan. Although the parganah of Dohad is reckoned as within the boundary\r\nof Gujarat, yet, in fact, it was from this stage that all things\r\nappeared different. The open plains and soil are of a different kind;\r\nthe people are different and the language of another description. The\r\njungle that appeared on the road, has fruit-bearing trees, such as\r\nthe mango and khirni and tamarind, and the method of guarding the\r\ncultivated fields is with hedges of zaqqum. The cultivators separate\r\ntheir fields with cactus, and leave a narrow road between them for\r\ncoming and going. Since all this country has a sandy soil, when any\r\nmovement takes place, so much dust rises that the faces of people are\r\nseen with difficulty, so that one should call Ahmadabad 'Gardabad'\r\n[659] (abode of dust). On Saturday, the 2nd, having marched 3 3/4 kos,\r\nI encamped on the bank of the Mahi. On Sunday, the 3rd, again after a\r\nmarch of 3 3/4 kos, I halted at the village of Bardala. At this stage\r\na number of mansabdars who had been appointed to serve in Gujarat\r\nhad the good fortune to kiss the threshold. Marching 5 kos on Monday,\r\nthe 4th, the royal standards halted at Chitrasima, and the next day,\r\nTuesday, after a march of 5 kos, in parganah Monda. [660] On this\r\nday three blue bulls were killed; one was larger than the others and\r\nweighed 13 maunds and 10 seers. On Wednesday, the 6th, I marched 6\r\nkos and halted in parganah Naryad. [661] In passing through the town\r\nI scattered 1,500 rupees. On Thursday, the 7th, marching 6 1/2 kos,\r\nI halted in the parganah of Pitlad. [662] In the country of Gujarat\r\nthere is no larger parganah than this; it has a revenue of 700,000\r\nrupees, equal to 23,000 current tumans of Iraq. The population of the\r\ntown (qasba), too, is dense. Whilst I passed through it I scattered\r\n1,000 rupees. All my mind is bent upon this, that under any pretext\r\nthe people of God may be benefited. As the chief way of riding among\r\nthe people of this country is in carts, I also wished to travel in a\r\ncart. I sat for 2 kos in a cart, but was much troubled with the dust,\r\nand after this till the end of the stage rode on horseback. On the\r\nroad Muqarrab Khan came from Ahmadabad, and had the good fortune to\r\nwait on me, and presented an offering of a pearl he had bought for\r\n30,000 rupees. On Friday, the 8th, marching 6 1/2 kos, the place of\r\nthe descent of prosperity was on the shore of the salt sea.\r\n\r\nCambay [663] is one of the old ports. According to the brahmins,\r\nseveral thousand years have passed since its foundation. In the\r\nbeginning its name was Trimbawati, and Raja Tryambak Kunwar had the\r\ngovernment of the country. It would take too long to write in detail\r\nthe circumstances of the aforesaid Raja as the brahmins relate it. In\r\nbrief, when the turn to the government came round to Raja Abhay Kumar,\r\n[664] who was one of his grandsons, by the decree of heaven a great\r\ncalamity happened to this city. So much dust and earth were poured\r\non it that all the houses and buildings were hidden, and the means\r\nof livelihood of many people was destroyed. Before the arrival of\r\nthis calamity, an idol (but), which the Raja worshipped, came in a\r\ndream and announced this event. The Raja with his family embarked\r\nin a ship, and carried away the idol with them with a pillar it had\r\nbehind it for a support. By chance the ship also was wrecked by a\r\nstorm of misfortune. As there was left still a term of life for the\r\nRaja, that pillar bore the boat of his existence in safety to the\r\nshore, and he proposed to rebuild the city. He put up the pillar as\r\na mark of repopulation and the coming together of the people. As in\r\nthe Hindi language they call a pillar istambh and khambh, they called\r\nthe city Istambhnagari and Khambawati, and sometimes also Trimbawati,\r\nin connection with the Raja's name; Khambawati has by degrees and much\r\nuse become Khambayat (Cambay). This port is one of the largest ports\r\n[665] in Hindustan and is near a firth, which is one of the firths\r\nof the Sea of Oman. It has been estimated to be 7 kos in width, and\r\nnearly 40 kos in length. Ships cannot come inside the firth, but\r\nmust cast anchor in the port of Goga, which is a dependency [666]\r\nof Cambay and situated near the sea. Thence, putting their cargoes\r\ninto ghurabs [667] (commonly called 'grabs') they bring them to the\r\nport of Cambay. In the same way, at the time of loading a ship they\r\ncarry the cargo in ghurabs and put it in the ships. Before the arrival\r\nof the victorious host some ghurabs from European ports had come to\r\nCambay to buy and sell, and were about to return. On Sunday, the 10th,\r\nthey decorated them and showed them to me. Taking leave they went\r\nabout their business. On Monday, the 11th, I myself went on board a\r\nghurab for about a kos on the face of the water. On Tuesday, the 12th,\r\nI went out with cheetahs (yuz), and captured two [668] antelope. On\r\nWednesday, the 13th, I went to see the tank of Tarangsar (Narangsar?),\r\n[669] and passed through the streets and bazaar on the way, scattering\r\nnearly 5,000 rupees. In the time of H.M. Akbar (may Allah's lights\r\nbe his testimony), Kalyan Ray, the superintendent of the port, by\r\nHis Majesty's order built a wall of brick and cement round the city,\r\nand many merchants came from various quarters and settled there, and\r\nbuilt fine houses and employed themselves in gaining their livelihood\r\nunder easy circumstances. Although its market is small, it is clean\r\nand full of people. In the time of the Sultans of Gujarat the customs\r\nof this port came to a large sum. Now in my reign it is ordered that\r\nthey should not take more than one in forty. In other ports, calling\r\nit a tithe, they take one in ten or one in eight, and give all kinds\r\nof trouble to merchants and travellers. In Jeddah, which is the port\r\nof Mecca, they take one in four or even more. One may imagine from\r\nthis what the customs of the ports of Gujarat must have come to in\r\nthe time of the former rulers. God be praised that this suppliant\r\nat the throne of God obtained the grace to remit the whole of the\r\ncustoms dues of his dominions, which came to a countless sum, and\r\nthe very name of customs (tamgha) has passed away from my empire. At\r\nthis time an order was given that tankas [670] of gold and silver\r\nshould be coined twice the weight of ordinary muhrs and rupees. The\r\nlegend on the gold coin was on one side the words \"Jahangir-shahi,\r\n1027\" (1618), and on the reverse \"Struck in Cambay in the 12th year\r\nof the reign.\" The legend for silver coins was on one side \"Sikka,\r\nJahangir-shahi, 1027\"; round it this hemistich, \"King Jahangir of the\r\nconquering ray struck this\"; and on the reverse, \"Coined at Cambay\r\nin the 12th year of the reign,\" with this second hemistich round it--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"When after the conquest of the Deccan he came to Gujarat from\r\n    Mandu.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn no reign except mine have tankas been coined except of copper [671];\r\nthe gold and silver tankas are my invention. I ordered it to be\r\ncalled the Jahangiri coinage. On Mubarak-shamba (Thursday), the\r\n14th the offering of Amanat Khan, the superintendent (mutasaddi)\r\nof Cambay, was laid before me in the women's apartments. His\r\nmansab was fixed, original and increase, at 1,500 personal and 400\r\nhorse. Nuru-d-din Quli was honoured with the mansab, original and\r\nincrease, of 3,000 personal and 600 horse. On Friday, the 15th,\r\nmounted on the elephant Nur-bakht, I made it run after a horse. It\r\nran exceedingly well, and when it was stopped stood well. This\r\nis the third time that I myself have ridden it. On Saturday,\r\nthe 16th, Ram Das, son of Jay Singh [672], was promoted to the\r\nmansab, original and increase, of 1,500 personal and 700 horse. On\r\nSunday, the 17th, an elephant each was given to Darab Khan. Amanat\r\nKhan, and Sayyid Bayazid Barha. In these few days during which\r\nI was encamped on the shore of the salt sea, merchants, traders,\r\nindigent people, and other inhabitants of the port of Cambay having\r\nbeen summoned before me, I gave each according to his condition\r\na dress of honour or a horse or travelling money or assistance\r\nin living. On this day, Sayyid Muhammad, Sahib Sajjada (Lord of\r\nthe prayer carpet) of Shah `Alam (a mosque near Ahmadabad), the\r\nsons of Shaikh Muhammad Ghaus, Shaikh Haidar, grandson of Miyan\r\nWajihu-d-din, and other Shaikhs living at Ahmadabad came to meet\r\nme and pay their respects. As my desire was to see the sea and the\r\nflow and ebb of the water, I halted for ten days, and on Tuesday,\r\nthe 19th (Day, about 30th December, 1618), the royal standards\r\nstarted for Ahmadabad. The best description of fish procurable\r\nin this place, the name of which is `arbiyat, [673] was caught\r\nand frequently brought for me by the fishermen. Without doubt\r\nthese fish, are, as compared with other fish of this country,\r\nmore delicious and better, but they are not of the flavour of\r\nthe rohu. One might say as nine to ten or even eight to ten. Of\r\nthe food which is peculiar to the people of Gujarat there is\r\nthe khichri of bajra (a mixture of split peas and millet boiled\r\ntogether); this they also call laziza. It is a kind of split\r\ngrain, which does not grow in any other country but Hindustan,\r\nand which in comparison with many other regions of India is more\r\nabundant in Gujarat; it is cheaper than most vegetables. As I had\r\nnever eaten it, I ordered them to make some and bring it to me. It\r\nis not devoid of good flavour, and it suited me well. I ordered\r\nthat on the days of abstinence, when I partake of dishes not made\r\nwith flesh, they should frequently bring me this khichri On the\r\nsaid Tuesday having marched 6 1/4 kos, I halted at the village of\r\nKosala. On Wednesday, the 20th, I passed through the parganah of\r\nBabra [674] and halted on the bank of the river. This was a march\r\nof 6 kos. On Mubarak-shamba, the 21st, I halted and held a feast\r\nof cups. In this river I caught many fish, and divided them among\r\nthe servants who were present at the feast. On Friday, the 22nd,\r\nhaving moved on 4 kos, I pitched at the village of Baricha. On\r\nthis road, walls came in sight from 2 1/2 to 3 gaz in length,\r\nand on enquiry it appeared that people had made them from the\r\ndesire of spiritual reward. When a porter is tired on the road he\r\nplaces his burden on the wall and gains his breath a little, and\r\nlifting it up again with ease and without assistance from anyone\r\nproceeds towards his destination. This is one of the peculiar\r\nideas of the people of Gujarat. The building of these walls\r\npleased me greatly, and I ordered that in all large towns [675]\r\nthey should make walls of this kind at the imperial expense. On\r\nSaturday, the 23rd marching 4 3/4 kos, the camp was pitched\r\nat the Kankriya tank. Qutbu-d-din Muhammad, grandson of Sultan\r\nAhmad, the founder of the city of Ahmadabad, made this tank, and\r\nplaced round it steps of stone and cement. In the middle of the\r\ntank he constructed a little garden and some buildings. Between\r\nthe bank of the tank and these buildings he had made a causeway,\r\nwhich was the way for entering and leaving, Since this occurred\r\na long time ago, most of the buildings had become dilapidated,\r\nand there was no place left fit to sit in. At the time when the host\r\nof prosperity was about to proceed towards Ahmadabad, Safi Khan,\r\nbakhshi of Gujarat, repaired at the expense of government what was\r\nbroken down and in ruins, and clearing out the little garden erected\r\na new building in it. Certainly it is a place exceedingly enjoyable\r\nand pleasant. Its style pleased me. On the side where the causeway\r\nis, Nizamu-d-din Ahmad, [676] who was for a while bakhshi of Gujarat\r\nin my father's time, had made a garden on the bank of the tank. At\r\nthis time a representation was made to me that `Abdu-llah Khan, in\r\nconsequence of a dispute that he had with `Abid, son of Nizamu-d-din\r\nAhmad, cut down the trees of this garden. I also heard that during\r\nhis government he, at a wine party, signed to a slave, and cut off\r\nthe head of an unfortunate man who was not wanting in fun and jesting,\r\nmerely because in a state of drunkenness he had uttered some improper\r\nexpressions by way of a joke. On hearing these two reports, my sense of\r\njustice was shocked, and I ordered the Diwans to change one thousand of\r\nhis two-horsed and three-horsed cavalry into one-horsed, and to deduct\r\nfrom his jagir the difference (of pay), which came to 7,000,000 dams.\r\n\r\nAs at this stage the tomb of Shah `Alam was by the roadside, I recited\r\nthe fatiha in passing by it. About 100,000 rupees had been spent in\r\nbuilding this mausoleum. Shah `Alam was the son of Qutb `Alam, and\r\ntheir family goes back to Makhdum-i-Jahaniyan [677] (a saint). The\r\npeople of this country, high and low, have a wonderful belief in him,\r\nand they say that Shah `Alam used to raise the dead. After he had\r\nraised several dead men, his father became aware of this and sent him\r\na prohibition, saying it was presumption in him to meddle with the\r\nworkshop of God, and was contrary to true obedience. It happened that\r\nShah `Alam had an attendant (female) who had no children, but at Shah\r\n`Alam's prayer God Almighty bestowed a son on her. When he reached\r\nhis 27th [678] year he died, and that slave came weeping and wailing\r\ninto his presence, saying, \"My son has died, and he was my only son;\r\nsince God Almighty gave him to me by your favour, I am hopeful that\r\nthrough your prayer he may become alive.\" Shah `Alam fell into thought\r\nfor a time and went into his cell, and the attendant went to his son,\r\nwho greatly loved her, and besought him to ask the Shah to make his son\r\nalive. The son, who was of tender years, went into his cell, and used\r\nmuch entreaty. Shah `Alam said, \"If you are content to give up your\r\nlife for him, perhaps my petition may be accepted.\" He represented\r\n\"I am perfectly contented with what may be your wish and the desire\r\nof God.\" Shah `Alam took his son's hands, and lifting him up from the\r\nground turned his face towards heaven and said, \"O God, take this kid\r\nin place of that one.\" Instantaneously the boy surrendered his soul to\r\nGod, and Shah `Alam laid him down on his own bed and covered his face\r\nwith a sheet, and coming out of the house said to that attendant,\r\n\"Go home, and get news of thy son; perhaps he may have been in a\r\ntrance and not have died.\" When she arrived at her house she saw\r\nher son alive. In short, in the country of Gujarat they say many\r\nthings of this sort of Shah `Alam. I myself asked Sayyid Muhammad,\r\nwho is lord of his prayer carpet (in charge of the mausoleum), and\r\nwho is not wanting in excellence and reasonableness, what was the\r\nreal state of the case. He said, \"I have also heard the same from\r\nmy father and grandfather, and it has come down in succession, and\r\nwisdom is from Allah.\" Although this affair is beyond the laws of\r\nunderstanding, yet, as it has attained great notoriety among men,\r\nit has been recorded as a strange occurrence. His departure from\r\nthis perishable mansion to the eternal world took place in 880\r\n(1475), in the time of the reign of Sultan Mahmud Bigara, and the\r\nbuildings of this mausoleum are the memorial of Taj Khan Tariyani,\r\n[679] who was one of the Amirs of Sultan Muzaffar, the son of Mahmud.\r\n\r\nAs an hour on Monday had been chosen for my entry into the city,\r\non Sunday, the 24th, I halted. At this place some melons came from\r\nKariz, which is a town dependent on Herat, and it is certain that\r\nin Khurasan there are no melons better than those of Kariz. Although\r\nthis is at a distance of 1,400 kos, and kafilahs (caravans) take five\r\nmonths to come, they arrived very ripe and fresh. They brought so many\r\nthat they sufficed for all the servants. Together with these there\r\ncame oranges (kaunla) from Bengal, and though that place is 1,000 kos\r\ndistant most of them arrived quite fresh. As this is a very delicate\r\nand pleasant fruit, runners bring by post as much as is necessary for\r\nprivate consumption, and pass it from hand to hand. My tongue fails\r\nme in giving thanks to Allah for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Thankfulness for Thy favours is one of Thy favours.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn this day Amanat Khan presented two elephants' tusks; they were\r\nvery large, one of them being 3 cubits 8 tassu (finger-breadths)\r\nin length and 16 tassu in circumference; it weighed 3 maunds and 2\r\nseers, or 24 1/2 Iraq maunds. On Monday, the 25th, after six gharis,\r\nI turned towards the city in pleasure and prosperity at the propitious\r\nhour, and mounted the elephant Surat-gaj, a favourite elephant of\r\nmine, which is perfect in appearance and disposition. Although\r\nhe was fractious (mast), I had confidence in my own riding and\r\nhis pleasant paces (?). [680] Crowds of people, men and women,\r\nhad assembled, and were waiting in the streets and bazars and at\r\nthe gates and the walls. The city of Ahmadabad did not seem to me\r\nso worthy of praise as I had heard. Although they had made the main\r\nroad of the bazar wide and spacious, they had not suited the shops\r\nto this breadth. Its buildings are all of wood and the pillars of\r\nthe shops slender and mean (zabun). The streets of the bazar were\r\nfull of dust, and there was dust from the Kankriya tank up to the\r\ncitadel, which in the dialect of the country they call Bhadar. I\r\nhastened along scattering money. The meaning of Bhadar is 'blessed'\r\n(bhadra). The houses of the Sultans of Gujarat, which were inside the\r\nBhadar, have fallen into ruin within the last fifty or sixty years,\r\nand no trace of them is left. However, our servants who have been sent\r\nto the government of this country have erected buildings. When I was\r\nproceeding from Mandu to Ahmadabad, Muqarrab Khan had done up the old\r\nbuildings and prepared other places for sitting that were necessary,\r\nsuch as a jharokha, a public audience hall, etc. As to-day was the\r\nauspicious day for the weighing of my son Shah Jahan, I weighed him\r\nin the usual manner against gold and other things, and the 27th year\r\nfrom his blessed birth began in pleasure and enjoyment. I hope that\r\nthe Giver of gifts will bestow him on this suppliant at His throne\r\nand let him enjoy life and prosperity. On the same day I gave the\r\nprovince of Gujarat in jagir to that son. From the fort of Mandu to\r\nthe fort of Cambay, by the road we came, it is 124 kos, which were\r\ntraversed in twenty-eight marches and thirty halts. I remained at\r\nCambay for ten days; from that place to the city of Ahmadabad is 21\r\nkos; which we traversed in five marches with two halts. Altogether,\r\nfrom Mandu to Cambay and from Cambay to Ahmadabad by the road we came\r\nis 145 kos, which we accomplished in two months and fifteen days;\r\nthis was in thirty-three marches and forty-two halts.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the 26th, I went to see the Jami` mosque, and gave\r\nwith my own hand in alms to the fakirs who were present there about\r\n500 rupees. This mosque was one of the memorials of Sultan Ahmad,\r\nthe founder of the city of Ahmadabad. It has three gates, [681]\r\nand on each side a bazar. Opposite the gate that looks towards the\r\neast is the mausoleum of the said Sultan Ahmad. In that dome Sultan\r\nAhmad, his son Muhammad, and his grandson Qutbu-d-din are laid to\r\nrest. The length of the court of the mosque, excluding maqsura\r\n(the holy of holies), is 103 [682] cubits, and its breadth 89\r\ncubits. Round this they have made an aywan (portico), in breadth 4\r\n3/4 cubits. The flooring of the court is of trimmed bricks, and the\r\npillars of the portico of red stone. The maqsura contains 354 [683]\r\npillars, above which there is a dome. The length of the maqsura is\r\n75 cubits, and its breadth 37 cubits. The flooring of the maqsura,\r\nthe mihrab (arch towards which the face is turned in prayer), and the\r\npulpit are made of marble. On both sides of the main arch (pish-taq)\r\nare two polished minarets of cut stone, containing three ashyana\r\n(stories) beautifully shaped and decorated. On the right-hand side of\r\nthe pulpit near the recess of the maqsura they have made a separate\r\nseat for the king. The space between the pillars has been covered in\r\nwith a stone platform, and round this up to the roof of the maqsura\r\nthey have put stone cages [684] (in which women sit so as not to be\r\nseen). The object of this was that when the king came to the Friday\r\nservice or the `Id he went up there with his intimates and courtiers,\r\nand performed his devotions. This in the dialect of the country they\r\ncall the Muluk-khana (King's chamber). This practice and caution were\r\non account of the crowding of the people. Truly this mosque is a very\r\nnoble building. [685]\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, [686] the 27th, I went to the monastery of Shaikh\r\nWajihu-d-din, which was near the palace, and the fatiha was read at the\r\nhead of his shrine, which is in the court of the monastery. Sadiq Khan,\r\nwho was one of the chief Amirs of my father, built this monastery. The\r\nShaikh was a successor of Shaikh Muhammad Ghaus, [687] but a successor\r\nagainst whom the teacher disputed. Wajihu-d-din's loyalty to him is a\r\nclear proof [688] of the greatness of Shaikh Muhammad Ghaus. Shaikh\r\nWajihu-d-din was adorned with visible excellencies and spiritual\r\nperfection. He died thirty years ago in this city (Ahmadabad),\r\nand after him Shaikh `Abdu-llah, according to his father's will,\r\ntook his place. He was a very ascetic dervish. When he died his son\r\nShaikh Asadu-llah sat in his place, and also quickly went to the\r\neternal world. After him his brother Shaikh Haidar became lord of\r\nthe prayer carpet, and is now alive, and is employed at the grave\r\nof his father and grandfather in the service of dervishes and in\r\nlooking after their welfare. The traces of piety are evident on the\r\nforehead of his life. As it was the anniversary festival of Shaikh\r\nWajihu-d-din, 1,500 rupees were given to Shaikh Haidar for the\r\nexpenses of the anniversary, and I bestowed 1,500 rupees more on the\r\nband of fakirs who were present in the monastery, with my own hand\r\nin charity, and made a present of 500 rupees to the grandson (?) of\r\nShaikh Wajihu-d-din. In the same way I gave something for expenses, and\r\nland to each of his relatives and adherents according to his merit. I\r\nordered Shaikh Haidar to bring before me the body of dervishes and\r\ndeserving people who were associated with him, in order that they\r\nmight ask for money for expenses and for land. On Thursday, the 28th,\r\nI went to look round the Rustam-Khan-bari, and scattered 1,500 rupees\r\non the road. They call a garden a bari in the language of India. This\r\nis a garden that my brother Shah Murad made in the name of his son\r\nRustam. I made a Thursday entertainment in this garden, and gave cups\r\nto some of my private servants. At the end of the day I went to the\r\nlittle garden of the hawali (mansion) of Shaikh Sikandar, which is\r\nsituated in the neighbourhood of this garden, and which has exceedingly\r\ngood figs. As picking the fruit with one's own hand gives it quite\r\na different relish, and I had never before plucked figs with my own\r\nhand, their excellence in this respect was approved. Shaikh Sikandar\r\n[689] is by origin a Gujarati, and is not wanting in reasonableness,\r\nand has complete information about the Sultans of Gujarat. It is now\r\neight or nine years since he has been employed among the servants\r\n(of the State). As my son Shah Jahan had appointed to the government\r\nof Ahmadabad Rustam Khan, who is one of his chief officers, at his\r\nrequest I, in accordance with the association of his name, presented\r\nhim with (the garden) Rustam-bari. On this day Raja Kalyan, zamindar\r\nof the province of Idar, had the good fortune to kiss my threshold,\r\nand presented an elephant and nine horses as an offering; I gave him\r\nback the elephant. He is one of the most considerable zamindars on the\r\nfrontier of Gujarat, and his country is close to the hill-country of\r\nthe Rana. The Sultans of Gujarat constantly sent armies against the\r\nRaja of that place. Although some of them have professed obedience\r\nand presented offerings, for the most part none of them have come to\r\nsee anyone personally. After the late king Akbar conquered Gujarat,\r\nthe victorious army was sent to attack him. As he understood that\r\nhis deliverance lay in obedience and submission, he agreed to serve\r\nand be loyal, and hastened to enjoy the good fortune of kissing the\r\nthreshold. From that date he has been enrolled among the servants (of\r\nthe State). He comes to see whoever is appointed to the government\r\nof Ahmadabad, and when work and service are necessary appears with\r\na body of his men. On Saturday, the 1st of the month of Bahman,\r\nin the 12th year of my reign, Chandar Sen, who is one of the chief\r\nzamindars of this country, had the good fortune to kiss the threshold,\r\nand presented an offering of nine horses. On Sunday, the 2nd, I\r\ngave elephants to Raja Kalyan, zamindar of Idar, to Sayyid Mustafa,\r\nand Mir Fazil. On Monday I went out hawking, and scattered nearly\r\n500 rupees on the road. On this day pears came from Badakhshan. On\r\nMubarak-shamba, the 6th, I went to see the \"garden of victory\" at\r\nthe village of Sair-khaiz (Sarkhej), and scattered 1,500 rupees on\r\nthe way. As the tomb of Shaikh Ahmad Khattu [690] is on the road, I\r\nfirst went there and the fatiha was read. Khattu is the name of a town\r\nin the Sarkar of Nagor, and was the birthplace of the Shaikh. [691]\r\nThe Shaikh lived in the time of Sultan Ahmad, who founded the city of\r\nAhmadabad, and the latter had a great respect for him. The people of\r\nthis country have a strange belief in him, and consider him one of the\r\ngreat saints. Every Friday night a great crowd of people, high and low,\r\ngo to visit his shrine. Sultan Muhammad, son of the aforesaid Sultan\r\nAhmad, built lofty buildings in the shape of mausoleums, mosques, and\r\nmonasteries at the head of his tomb, and near his mausoleum on the\r\nsouth side made a large tank, and surrounded it with stone and lime\r\n(masonry). This building was completed in the time of Qutbu-d-din,\r\nson of the aforesaid Muhammad. The shrines of several of the Sultans\r\nof Gujarat are on the bank of the tank by the feet of the Shaikh. In\r\nthat dome there have been laid at rest Sultan Mahmud Bigara, Sultan\r\nMuzaffar, his son, and Mahmud, the martyr, grandson of Sultan Muzaffar,\r\nand who was the last of the Sultans of Gujarat. Bigara, in the\r\nlanguage of the people of Gujarat, signifies 'turned-up moustache,'\r\nand Sultan Mahmud had a large turned-up moustache; on this account\r\nthey call him Bigara. Near his (Shaikh Khattu's) tomb is the dome of\r\nhis ladies. [692] Without doubt the mausoleum of the Shaikh is a very\r\ngrand building and a beautiful place. It is estimated that 500,000\r\nrupees were spent on it. God only knows what is true.\r\n\r\nAfter performing this visitation I went to Fath-bagh (garden\r\nof victory). This garden is situated on the ground on which the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, Khankhanan Ataliq fought with and defeated Nabu\r\n(Nannu? Nanhu?), who gave himself the title of Muzaffar Khan. On\r\nthis account he called it Bagh-i-fath; the people of Gujarat call\r\nit Fath-bari. The details of this are that when, by means of the\r\ngood fortune of the late king Akbar, the country of Gujarat was\r\nconquered, and Nabu fell into his hands, I`timad Khan represented\r\nthat he was the son of a carter. As no son was left by Sultan Mahmud,\r\nand moreover there was no one of the descendants of the Sultans of\r\nGujarat whom he could raise to the throne, he (I`timad) had accepted\r\nthe most available course, and had made out that this was the son of\r\nMahmud. He gave him the name of Sultan Muzaffar, and raised him to\r\nthe sovereignty. Men from necessity consented to this. As His Majesty\r\nconsidered the word of I`timad Khan of weight, he ignored Nabu, and\r\nfor some time he did duty among the servants, and the king paid no\r\nattention to his case. In consequence of this he ran away from Fathpur,\r\nand coming to Gujarat lived for some years under the protection of\r\nthe zamindars. When Shihabu-d-din Ahmad Khan was turned out from the\r\ngovernment of Gujarat and I`timad Khan installed in his place, a body\r\nof the servants of Shihabu-d-din Khan, who were attached to Gujarat,\r\nseparated from him, and remained at Ahmadabad in the hope of service\r\nwith I`timad. After I`timad entered the city they had recourse to\r\nhim, but had no good luck with him. They had not the face to go to\r\nShihabu-d-din, and had no prospects in Ahmadabad. As they were without\r\nhope they thought their remedy lay in betaking themselves to Nabu,\r\nand in making him an excuse for disturbance. With this intent 600 or\r\n700 horsemen from among them went to Nabu and carried him off along\r\nwith Lona Kathi, under whose protection he was living, and proceeded\r\nto Ahmadabad. When he arrived near the city many wretched men on\r\nthe look out for an occasion joined him, and nearly 1,000 horsemen,\r\nMughals and Gujaratis, collected together. When I`timad Khan became\r\naware of this he left his son Shir Khan in the city, and hastened\r\noff in search of Shihab Khan, who was proceeding towards the Court,\r\nin order that with his help he might quiet the disturbance. Many of\r\nthe men had separated themselves from him, and he read on the faces\r\nof those who were left the signs of unfaithfulness, but Shihabu-d-din,\r\nin company with I`timad Khan, turned his rein. It happened that before\r\ntheir arrival Nabu had entered the fort of Ahmadabad. Those who were\r\nloyal drew up their troops near the city, and the rebels came out of\r\nthe fort and hastened to the battlefield. When the army of the rebels\r\nshowed itself, those of the servants of Shihab Khan who were left\r\ntook the wrong road and joined the enemy. Shihab Khan was defeated\r\nand hastened towards Patan (Patan?), which was in the possession of\r\nthe royal servants. His retinue and camp were plundered, and Nabu,\r\nbestowing mansabs and titles on the rebels, went against Qutbu-d-din\r\nMuhammad Khan, who was in Baroda. The servants of the latter,\r\nlike the servants of Shihab Khan, took the road of faithlessness\r\nand chose separation, as is related in detail in the Akbar-nama. In\r\nthe end, after giving his word to Qutbu-d-din Muhammad, he sent him\r\nto martyrdom, and his goods and property, which were equal to the\r\ntreasure of his courtesy and grandeur, were plundered. Nearly 45,000\r\nhorsemen collected round Nabu.\r\n\r\nWhen this state of affairs was represented to H.M. Akbar he sent\r\nagainst him Mirza Khan, son of Bairam Khan, with a force of brave\r\nwarriors. On the day when Mirza Khan arrived near the city, he drew\r\nup the ranks of good fortune. He had about 8,000 or 9,000 horse, and\r\nNabu met him with 30,000, and drew up his host tainted with ruin. After\r\nprolonged fighting and slaughter the breeze of victory blew on the flag\r\nof the loyal, and Nabu, being defeated, fled in wretched plight. My\r\nfather, in reward for this victory, gave Mirza Khan a mansab of 5,000\r\nwith the title of Khankhanan and the government of the country of\r\nGujarat. The garden that Khankhanan made on the field of battle is\r\nsituated on the bank of the River Sabarmati. He founded lofty buildings\r\nalong that eminence on the river, and made a strong wall of stone and\r\ncement round the garden. The garden contains 120 jarib of land, and\r\nis a charming resort. It may have cost 200,000 rupees. It pleased me\r\ngreatly. One may say that in the whole of Gujarat there is no garden\r\nlike this. Arranging a Thursday feast, I bestowed cups on my private\r\nservants, and remained there for the night. At the end of the day,\r\non Friday, I entered the city, scattering about 1,000 rupees on the\r\nroad. At this time the gardener represented that a servant of Muqarrab\r\nKhan had cut down some champa trees above the bench alongside the\r\nriver. On hearing this I became angry, and went myself to enquire into\r\nthe matter and to exact satisfaction. When it was established that this\r\nimproper act had been committed by him, I ordered both his thumbs to\r\nbe cut off as a warning to others. It was evident that Muqarrab Khan\r\nknew nothing of this affair, or otherwise he would have punished him\r\nthere and then. On Tuesday, the 11th, the Kotwal of the city caught\r\na thief and brought him. He had committed several thefts before, and\r\neach time they had cut off one of his members; once his right hand,\r\nthe second time the thumb of his left hand, the third time his left\r\near, and fourth time they hamstringed him, and the last time his nose;\r\nwith all this he did not give up his business, and yesterday entered\r\nthe house of a grass-seller in order to steal. By chance the owner\r\nof the house was on the look out and seized him. The thief wounded\r\nthe grass-seller several times with a knife and killed him. In the\r\nuproar and confusion his relatives attacked the thief and caught him. I\r\nordered them to hand over the thief to the relatives of the deceased,\r\nthat they might retaliate on him.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The lines of the face show the thought of your head (?).\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the 12th, 3,000 rupees were handed over to `Azamat\r\nKhan and Mu`taqad Khan, that they might go the next day to the tomb\r\nof Shaikh Ahmad Khattu, and divide it among the fakirs and indigent\r\npeople who had taken up their abode there. On Thursday, the 13th,\r\nI went to the lodging of my son Shah Jahan, and held a Mubarak-shamba\r\nentertainment there, and distributed cups among my private servants. I\r\ngave my son the elephant Sundar Mathan, [693] which was superior\r\nto all my private elephants in speed and beauty and pleasant paces,\r\nand competed with horses, and was the first among the elephants, and\r\none much liked by King Akbar. My son Shah Jahan had a great liking\r\nfor him, and frequently asked him of me, and seeing no way out of it\r\nI gave it to him with its gold belongings of chains, etc., together\r\nwith a female elephant. A present of 100,000 of darbs was given to\r\nthe wakils of `Adil Khan. At this time it was represented [694] to\r\nme that Mukarram Khan, son of Mu`azzam Khan, who was the governor of\r\nOrissa, had conquered the country of Khurda, and that the Raja of that\r\nplace had fled and gone into the Rajmahendra. As he was a khana-zad\r\n(houseborn one) and worthy of patronage, I ordered his mansab, original\r\nand increase, to be 3,000 personal and 2,000 horse, and honoured him\r\nwith drums, a horse, and a dress of honour. Between the province of\r\nOrissa and Golconda there were two zamindars, one the Raja of Khurda\r\nand the second the Raja of Rajmahendra. The province of Khurda has\r\ncome into the possession of the servants of the Court. After this it\r\nis the turn of the country of Rajmahendra. My hope in the grace of\r\nAllah is that the feet of my energy may advance farther. At this time\r\na petition from Qutbu-l-mulk reached my son Shah Jahan to the effect\r\nthat as the boundary of his territory had approached that of the King,\r\nand he owed service to this Court, he hoped an order would be issued to\r\nMukarram Khan not to stretch out his hand, and to acquire possession\r\nof his country. It was a proof of Mukarram's valour and energy that\r\nsuch a one as Qutbu-l-mulk should be apprehensive about his (Mukarram)\r\nbecoming his neighbour.\r\n\r\nOn this day Ikram Khan, son of Islam Khan, was appointed faujdar of\r\nFathpur and its neighbourhood, and presented with a dress of honour\r\nand an elephant; Chandar Sen, the zamindar of Haloz (Halwad?), [695]\r\nwas given a dress of honour, a horse, and an elephant. An elephant\r\nwas also given to Lachin Qaqshal. At the same time Muzaffar, [696]\r\nson of Mirza Baqi Tarkhan, had the honour of kissing the threshold. His\r\nmother was the daughter of Barha (Bhara), the zamindar of Kachh. When\r\nMirza Baqi died and the government of Thatta went to Mirza Jani,\r\nMuzaffar was apprehensive of Mirza Jani, and he took refuge with the\r\naforesaid zamindar. He had remained from his childhood until now in\r\nthat country. Now that the fortunate retinue had reached Ahmadabad, he\r\ncame and did homage. Though he had been reared among men of the wilds,\r\nand was unfamiliar with civilized ways and ceremonies, yet as his\r\nfamily had had the relations of service with our exalted dynasty from\r\nthe times of Timur [697]--may God make his proof clear!--I considered\r\nit right to patronize him. For the present I gave him 2,000 rupees\r\nfor expenses, and a dress of honour. A suitable rank will be given\r\nto him, and perhaps he will show himself efficient as a soldier.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the 20th, I went to the \"Garden of Victory,\" and\r\ncontemplated the red roses. One plot had bloomed well. There are not\r\nmany red roses (gul-i-surkh) in this country, so it was pleasant\r\nto see so many here. The anemone [698] bed, too, was not bad, and\r\nthe figs had ripened. I gathered some figs with my own hands, and\r\nweighed the largest one. It came to 7 1/2 tolas. On this day there\r\narrived 1,500 melons from Kariz. The Khan `Alam had sent them as a\r\npresent. I gave a thousand of them to the servants in attendance,\r\nand five hundred to the women of the harem. I spent four days in\r\nthis garden in enjoyment, and on Monday eve, the 24th, I came to the\r\ncity. Some of the melons were given to the Shaikhs of Ahmadabad, and\r\nthey were astonished to see how inferior were the Gujarat melons. They\r\nmarvelled at the goodness of the Deity.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the 27th, I held a wine-feast in the Nagina [699]\r\ngarden, which is inside the palace grounds, and which one of the\r\nGujarat Sultans had planted. I made my servants happy with flowing\r\nbowls. A pergola (takhta) of grapes had ripened in this garden, and\r\nI bade those who had been drinking to gather the bunches with their\r\nown hands and partake of them.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 1st of Isfandarmuz, I left Ahmadabad and marched towards\r\nMalwa. I scattered money on the road till we reached the bank of the\r\nKankriya tank, where I halted for three days. On Thursday, the 4th,\r\nthe presents of Muqarrab Khan were laid before me. There was nothing\r\nrare among them, nor anything that I took a fancy to, and so I felt\r\nashamed. I gave them to my children to take into the harem. I accepted\r\njewellery and decorated vessels and cloths to the value of a lakh,\r\nand gave him back the rest. Also about one hundred Kachhi horses were\r\ntaken, but there was none of great excellence.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, the 5th, I marched 6 kos, and encamped on the bank of\r\nthe Ahmadabad River. As my son Shah Jahan was leaving Rustam Khan,\r\none of his chief servants, in charge of the government of Gujarat, I,\r\nat my son's request, gave him a standard, drums, a dress of honour,\r\nand a decorated dagger. Up till now it had not been the custom in\r\nthis dynasty to give to the prince's servants standards or drums. For\r\ninstance, H.M. Akbar with all his affection and graciousness to me,\r\ndid not decide upon giving to my officers a title or a standard. But\r\nmy consideration for this son is so unbounded that I would do anything\r\nto please him, and, in fact, he is an excellent son, and one adorned\r\nwith every grace, and in his early youth has accomplished to my\r\nsatisfaction, everything that he has set his hand to.\r\n\r\nOn this day Muqarrab Khan took leave to go to his home.\r\n\r\nAs the shrine of Qutb `Alam, the father of Shah `Alam Bukhari, was in\r\nthe village of Batoh, [700] and on my way, I went there and gave 500\r\nrupees to the guardians. On Saturday, the 6th, I entered a boat on\r\nthe Mahmudabad River and went a-fishing. On the bank is the tomb of\r\nSayyid Mubarak Bukhari. He was one of the leading officers of Gujarat,\r\nand his son Sayyid Miran erected this monument to him. It is a very\r\nlofty cupola, and there is a very strong wall of stone and lime round\r\nit. It must have cost more than two lakhs of rupees. None of the tombs\r\nof the Gujarat Sultans that I saw came up to one-tenth of it. Yet\r\nthey were sovereigns, and Sayyid Miran was only a servant. Genius\r\nand the help of God have produced this result. A thousand blessings\r\non a son who has made such a tomb for his father: [701]\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"That there may remain a memorial of him upon earth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Sunday I halted and fished, and caught 400 fish. One of them had\r\nno scales, and is called the sang-mahi, 'the stone-fish.' Its belly\r\nwas very large and swollen, so I ordered them to cut it open in my\r\npresence. Inside was a fish with scales which it had recently swallowed\r\nand which had as yet undergone no change. I told them to weigh both\r\nfish. The stone-fish came to 6 1/2 seers and the other to nearly 2.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 8th, I marched 4 1/4 kos, and encamped in the village\r\nof Moda (Mahaondat). The inhabitants praised the rainy season of\r\nGujarat. It happened that on the previous night and on this day before\r\nbreakfast some rain fell, and the dust was laid. As this is a sandy\r\ncountry, it is certain that there would not be any dust in the rainy\r\nseason, nor would there be any mud. The fields would be green and\r\ncheerful. At any rate, a specimen of the rainy season has been seen\r\nby me. On Tuesday I marched 5 1/2 kos, and halted at the village of\r\nJarsima (Jarisama). [702]\r\n\r\nAt this stage news came that Man Singh Sewra had surrendered his\r\nsoul to the lords of hell. The account of this in brief is that\r\nthe Sewras [703] are a tribe of infidel Hindus who always go with\r\ntheir head and feet bare. One set of them root out their hair, their\r\nbeards, and moustaches, while another set shave them. They do not\r\nwear sewn garments, and their central principle is that no living\r\ncreature should be injured. The Banyans regard them as their pirs\r\nand teachers, and even worship them. There are two sects of Sewras,\r\none called Pata (Tapa) and the other Kanthal (Kartal). Man Singh was\r\nthe head of the latter, and Bal Chand the head of the Patas. [704]\r\nBoth of them used to attend upon H.M. Akbar. When he died and Khusrau\r\nfled and I pursued him, Ray Singh Bhurtiya, zamindar of Bikanir,\r\nwho had been made an Amir by Akbar's kindness, asked Man Singh what\r\nwould be the duration of my reign and the chances of my success. That\r\nblack-tongued fellow, who pretended to be skilled in astrology and\r\nthe extraction of judgments, said to him that my reign would, at most,\r\nlast for two years. The doting old idiot (Ray Singh) relied upon this,\r\nand went off without leave to his home. Afterwards, when the glorious\r\nGod chose out this suppliant and I returned victorious to the capital,\r\nhe came, ashamed and downcast, to Court. What happened to him in the\r\nend has been told in its proper place. [705] In fine, Man Singh, in\r\nthe course of three or four months, was struck with leprosy (juzam),\r\nand his limbs fell off him till he was in such a state that death\r\nwas by many degrees preferable to life. He was living at Bikanir,\r\nand now I remembered him and sent for him. On the road he, out of\r\nexcessive fear, took poison, and surrendered his soul to the lords\r\nof hell. So long as the intentions of this suppliant at God's courts\r\nare just and right, it is sure that whoever devises evil against me\r\nwill receive retribution according to his merits.\r\n\r\nThe sect of the Sewras exists in most of the cities of India, but is\r\nespecially numerous in Gujarat. As the Banyans are the chief traders\r\nthere, consequently the Sewras also are plentiful. Besides making\r\nidol-temples for them, they have built houses for them to dwell in\r\nand to worship in. In fact, these houses are the headquarters of\r\nsedition. The Banyans send their wives and daughters to the Sewras,\r\nwho have no shame or modesty. All kinds of strife and audacity are\r\nperpetrated by them. I therefore ordered that the Sewras should be\r\nexpelled, and I circulated farmans to the effect that wherever there\r\nwere Sewras in my empire they should be turned out.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the 10th, I went out to hunt, and shot two nilgaw,\r\none male and one female. On this day the son of Dilawar Khan came\r\nfrom Pattan, which was his father's fief, and paid his respects. He\r\npresented a Kachhi horse. It was a very handsome animal, and pleasant\r\nto ride. Till I came to Gujarat no one had presented me with so fine\r\na horse. Its value was 1,000 rupees.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the 11th, I had a wine party on the bank of the tank,\r\nand bestowed many favours on those servants who had been appointed to\r\nthe province, and then dismissed them. Among the promotions was that\r\nof Shaja`at Khan, the Arab, to the rank of 2,500 personal and 2,000\r\nhorse. I also gave him drums, a horse, and a robe of honour. Himmat\r\nKhan was raised to the rank of 1,500 with 800 horse, and had a\r\nrobe of honour and an elephant. Kifayat Khan, who was made Diwan of\r\nthe province, received the rank of 1,200 with 300 horse. Safi Khan\r\nbakhshi received a horse and a robe of honour. Khwaja `Aqil had the\r\nrank of 1,500 with 650 horse, and was made bakhshi of the Ahadis,\r\nand had the title of `Aqil Khan. Thirty thousand darbs were given to\r\nthe wakil of Qutbu-l-Mulk, who had brought the tribute.\r\n\r\nOn this day my son Shah Jahan presented pomegranates and quinces\r\nthat had been sent to him from Farah. I had never seen such large\r\nones, and I ordered them to be weighed. The quince weighed 29 tolas\r\n9 mashas and the pomegranate 40 1/2 tolas. On Friday, the 12th, I\r\nwent a-hunting and shot two nilgaw, a male and a female. On Saturday,\r\nthe 13th, I shot three nilgaw, two males and one female. On Sunday,\r\nthe 14th, I gave Shaikh Isma`il, the son of Shaikh Muhammad Ghaus, a\r\nrobe of honour and 500 rupees. On Monday, the 15th, I went a-hunting\r\nand shot two female nilgaw. On Tuesday, the 16th, I again presented\r\nthe Shaikhs of Gujarat, who were in attendance, with robes of honour\r\nand maintenance-lands. To each of them I gave a book from my special\r\nlibrary, such as the Tafsir-i-kashshaf, [706] the Tafsir-i-Husaini,\r\n[707] and the Rauzatu-l-ahbab. [708] I wrote on the back of the\r\nbooks the day of my arrival in Gujarat and the day of presentation\r\nof the books.\r\n\r\nAt the time that Ahmadabad was adorned by the setting up of the\r\nroyal standards my employment by day and by night was the seeing of\r\nnecessitous persons and the bestowing on them of money and land. I\r\ndirected Shaikh Ahmad the Sadr and some other tactful servants to\r\nbring before me dervishes and other needy persons. I also directed the\r\nsons of Shaikh Muhammad Ghaus, the grandson of Shaikh Wajihu-d-din,\r\nand other leading Shaikhs to produce whatever persons they believed\r\nto be in want. Similarly I appointed some women to do the same thing\r\nin the harem. My sole endeavour was that as I a king had come to this\r\ncountry after many years, no single person should be excluded. God is\r\nmy witness that I did not fall short in this task, and that I never\r\ntook any rest from this duty. Although I have not been delighted with\r\nmy visit to Ahmadabad, yet I have this satisfaction--that my coming\r\nhas been the cause of benefit to a large number of poor people.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the 16th, they caught Kaukab, the son of Qamar Khan. He had\r\nin Burhanpur put on a faqir's dress and gone off into the wilds. The\r\nbrief account of his case is this:--He was the grandson of Mir\r\n`Abdu-l-Latif, who was one of the Saifi Sayyids and was attached to\r\nthis Court. Kaukab had been appointed to the Deccan army, and had\r\nspent some days with it in poverty and wretchedness. When for a long\r\ntime he did not get promotion he suspected that I was unfavourable\r\nto him, and foolishly took the dress of asceticism and went off to\r\nthe wilderness. In the course of six months he traversed the whole\r\nof the Deccan, including Daulatabad, Bidar, Bijapur, the Carnatic,\r\nand Golconda, and came to the port of Dabul. [709] From there he came\r\nby ship to the port of Goga, and after visiting the ports of Surat,\r\nBroach, etc., he reached Ahmadabad. At this time Zahid, a servant\r\nof Shah Jahan, arrested him and brought him to Court. I ordered them\r\nto bring him before me heavily bound. When I saw him I said to him,\r\n\"Considering the obligations of service of your father and grandfather,\r\nand your position as a houseborn one, why have you behaved in such an\r\ninauspicious manner?\" He replied that he could not tell a lie in the\r\npresence of his qibla and real teacher, and that the truth was that\r\nhe had hoped for favours, but as he was unlucky he had left outward\r\nties and gone into the wilderness of exile. As his words bore the\r\nmarks of truth they made an impression on me, and I abandoned my\r\nharsh tone and asked him if in his misfortunes he had waited upon\r\n`Adil Khan, or Qutbu-l-Mulk, or `Ambar. He replied that though he\r\nhad been unsuccessful at this Court and had remained thirsty in\r\nthis boundless ocean of beneficence, he had never--God forbid that\r\nhe should--approached with his lips other fountains. Might his head\r\nbe cut off if it had bowed at this Court and then lowered itself at\r\nanother! From the time that he went into exile he had kept a diary\r\nshowing what he had done, and by examining it it would be seen how he\r\nhad conducted himself. These words of his increased my compassion for\r\nhim, and I sent for his papers and read them. It appeared from them\r\nthat he had encountered great hardship, and that he had spent much\r\ntime on foot, and that he had suffered from want of food. On this\r\naccount I felt kindly disposed towards him. Next day I sent for him\r\nand ordered them to remove the bonds from his arms and legs, and gave\r\nhim a robe of honour, a horse, and 1,000 rupees for his expenses. I\r\nalso increased his rank by one half, and showed him such kindness as\r\nhe never had imagined. He repeated this verse--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"What I see, is it, O God, waking or in a trance?\r\n    Do I behold myself in such comfort after such torture?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the 17th, I marched 6 kos and halted at the village of\r\nBarasinor (Balasinor). It has already been mentioned that the plague\r\nhad appeared in Kashmir. On this day a report of the chronicler of\r\nevents arrived, stating that the plague had taken firm hold of the\r\ncountry and that many had died. The symptoms were that the first day\r\nthere was headache and fever and much bleeding at the nose. On the\r\nsecond day the patient died. In the house where one person died all\r\nthe inmates were carried off. Whoever went near the sick person or a\r\ndead body was affected in the same way. In one instance the dead body\r\nwas thrown on the grass, and it chanced that a cow came and ate some\r\nof the grass. It died, and some dogs that had eaten its flesh also all\r\ndied. Things had come to such a pass that from fear of death fathers\r\nwould not approach their children, and children would not go near their\r\nfathers. A strange thing was that in the ward in which the disease\r\nbegan, a fire broke out and nearly 3,000 houses were burnt. During\r\nthe height of the plague, one morning when the people of the city and\r\nenvirons got up, they saw circles on their doors. There were three\r\nlarge circles, and on the face of these (i.e. inside them) there were\r\ntwo circles of middle size and one small one. There were also other\r\ncircles which did not contain any whiteness [710] (i.e. there were no\r\ninner circles). These figures were found on all the houses and even on\r\nthe mosques. From the day when the fire took place and these circles\r\nappeared, they say there was a diminution of the plague. This has been\r\nrecorded as it seems a strange affair. It certainly does not agree\r\nwith the canons of reason, and my intellect cannot accept it. Wisdom\r\nis with God! I trust that the Almighty will have mercy on his sinful\r\nslaves, and that they will be altogether freed from such calamity.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the 18th, I marched 2 1/2 kos and halted on the bank of\r\nthe Mahi. On this day the Jam zamindar [711] had the good fortune to\r\nkiss the ground. He presented 50 horses, 100 muhrs, and 100 rupees. His\r\nname is Jassa, and Jam is his title. Whoever succeeds is called Jam. He\r\nis one of the chief zamindars of Gujarat, and, indeed, he is one of\r\nthe noted rajas of India. His country is close to the sea. He always\r\nmaintains 5,000 or 6,000 horse, and in time of war can supply as many\r\nas 10,000 or 12,000. There are many horses in his country; Kachhi\r\nhorses fetch as much as 2,000 rupees. I gave him a dress of honour.\r\n\r\nOn the same day Lachmi Narayan, Raja of Kuch (Bihar), which adjoins\r\nBengal, did homage and presented 500 muhrs. He received a dress of\r\nhonour and an ornamented dagger.\r\n\r\nNawazish Khan, son of Sa`id Khan, who had been appointed to Junagarh,\r\nhad the good fortune to pay his respects. On Friday, the 19th, I\r\nhalted, and on Saturday, the 20th, I marched 3 3/4 kos and halted\r\nat the tank of Jhanud. On Sunday I marched 4 1/2 kos and halted at\r\nthe tank of Badarwala. On this day there came the news of the death\r\nof `Azamat Khan Gujarati. On account of illness he had remained in\r\nAhmadabad. He was a servant who knew one's disposition, and did good\r\nwork. As he had thorough knowledge of the Deccan and Gujarat, I was\r\ngrieved at his death. In the tank above mentioned I noticed a plant\r\nwhich at the approach of the finger or the end of a stick contracts\r\nits leaves. After a while it opens them out again. Its leaves resemble\r\nthose of the tamarind, and it is called in Arabic Shajaru-l-haya,\r\n'the plant of modesty.' In Hindi it is called Lajvanti. Laj means\r\nmodesty. It is certainly not void of strangeness. They also call it\r\nnaghzak, and say that it also grows on dry land.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 22nd, I halted. My scouts reported that there was a\r\ntiger in the neighbourhood which vexed wayfarers, and in the forest\r\nwhere it was they had seen a skull and some bones lying. After midday\r\nI went out to shoot it, and killed it with one discharge. Though it\r\nwas a large tiger, I had killed several that were larger. Among them\r\nwas a tiger which I killed in the fort of Mandu, and which was 8 1/2\r\nmaunds. This one weighed 7 1/2 maunds, or 1 maund less.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the 23rd, I marched over 3 1/2 kos and alighted on\r\nthe bank of the River Bayab. [712] On Wednesday I marched nearly 6\r\nkos and halted at the tank of Hamda. [713] On Thursday I ordered a\r\nhalt and had a wine party, and gave cups to my special servants. I\r\npromoted Nawazish Khan to the rank of 3,000 with 2,000 horse, which\r\nwas an increase of 500 personal, and gave him a robe of honour and an\r\nelephant, and allowed him to go to his fief. Muhammad Husain Sabzak,\r\n[714] who had been sent to Balkh to buy horses, came to Court to-day\r\nand paid his respects. Of the horses he brought, one was piebald\r\nand was of fine shape and colour. I had never seen a piebald horse\r\nof this colour before. He had also brought other good roadsters. I\r\ntherefore gave him the title of Tijarati Khan.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, the 26th, I marched 5 1/4 kos and halted at the village of\r\nJalod. [715] Raja Lachmi Narayan, the paternal uncle of the Raja of\r\nKuch, to whom I had now given the territory of Kuch, was presented\r\nwith a horse. On Saturday I marched 3 kos and halted at Boda. [716]\r\nOn Sunday I marched 5 kos and set up the royal standards at Dohad. It\r\nis on the borders of Malwa and Gujarat.\r\n\r\nPahluwan Baha'u-d-din, the musketeer, brought a young monkey (langur)\r\nwith a goat, and represented that on the road one of his marksmen had\r\nseen the female langur with a young one in its arms on a tree. The\r\ncruel man had shot the mother, which on being struck had left the\r\nyoung one on a branch, and had herself dropped on the ground and\r\ndied. Pahluwan Baha'u-d-din had then come up and taken down the young\r\none, and had put it beside the goat to be suckled. God had inspired\r\nthe goat with affection for it, and it began to lick the monkey and to\r\nfondle it. In spite of difference of species she showed such love as\r\nif it had come out of her own womb. I told them to separate them, but\r\nthe goat immediately began to lament, and the young langur also became\r\nmuch distressed. The affection of the monkey is not so remarkable,\r\nas it wanted to get milk, but the affection of the goat for it is\r\nremarkable. The langur is an animal belonging to the monkey tribe. But\r\nthe hair of the monkey (maimun) is yellowish and its face is red,\r\nwhile the hair of the langur is white and its face is black. Its tail,\r\ntoo, is twice as long as the maimun's. I have written these things on\r\naccount of their strangeness. On Monday, the 29th, I halted and went\r\nto hunt nilgaw. I shot two, one male and one female. On Tuesday also,\r\nthe 30th, I halted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            End of the twelfth year of the Emperor's reign,\r\n                       in the Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nERRATA AND ADDENDA.\r\n\r\n\r\nPage 15, line 7 from foot.

The I. O. MSS. have Marraj as\r\nthe name of the antelope. Perhaps we should read Manoraj 'mind's lord.'\r\n\r\np. 99, l. 3 from foot. I. O. MSS, have bahur b-hUr as the name of\r\nthe net.\r\n\r\np. 109, n. 1. Delete note. The rang is the ibex.\r\n\r\np. 110, n. 1. See J.A.S.B. for February, 1908, p. 39.\r\n\r\np. 117. The Iqbal-nama mentions in connection with the story of the\r\nmummified saint that many Sabzawar saints lived in Bamiyan. See also\r\nKamgar Husaini.\r\n\r\np. 120, l. 1. Delete word 'Georgians.' I. O. MS. No. 181 has ghurja.\r\n\r\np. 122, l. 10. Insert 'and' after 'sheep.'\r\n\r\np. 125, l. 13. For garden read gardens.\r\n\r\np. 133, l. 4. For £ read rupees.\r\n\r\np. 134, l. 15. For he died on the 29th read he died in his ninth decade\r\n(i.e. between 80 and 90). The Ma'asiru-l-umara, ii, 143, says he was\r\n82 when he died.\r\n\r\np. 134, l. 13 from foot. Instead of 'he went off alone' the MSS. have\r\n'carrying off his life' (i.e. escaping) with difficulty.\r\n\r\np. 136, n. 1. The opinion expressed in this note is proved to be wrong\r\nby General Cunningham's Report, Arch. S., xiv, p. 58. The tombs are\r\nthose of a musician and his pupil.\r\n\r\np. 140, l. 8. Delete Sylvia olivacea.\r\n\r\np. 143, l. 7. Apparently there were twelve balls, or at least objects,\r\nten being as large as an orange, another being a citron, and the\r\ntwelfth a surkh. So instead of 'one to a citron' we should read,\r\nperhaps, 'a citron and a surkh.'\r\n\r\np. 143, l. 3 from foot. For Ilf read Alf.\r\n\r\np. 147, l. 4 from foot. Delete the word 'Egyptian' and also n. 1. It\r\nappears from the Ghiyasu-l-loghat that a Qutbi ruby is a broad ruby\r\nsuitable for a ring (signet?).\r\n\r\np. 153, l. 13 from foot. For Hamazani read Hamadani.\r\n\r\np. 156. According to Terry, Jahandar was called Sultan Takht because\r\nborn when Jahangir first sat on his throne.\r\n\r\np. 158, l. 9. Perhaps Yuzi = Yuz-bashi, i.e. centurion. But I. O. 181\r\nhas not the word, only saying 'Shah Beg Khan,' and No. 305 has Shah\r\nBeg Khan Buri(?).\r\n\r\np. 158, l. 10. The passage is wrongly translated. No elephant\r\nwas presented to Salamu-llah. The sentence should end on\r\nl. 9 after the word 'panther-keeper,' which word is probably a\r\nmistranslation. Then this new sentence should come, i.e. 'Salamu-llah\r\n`Arab, who is a young man of a distinguished Arabian family (kih az\r\njawanan-i-qarar-dada-i-`Arab ast) and related to Mubarak, the governor\r\nof Dizful, came to wait upon me on account of his being suspicious\r\nof the designs of Shah `Abbas (against himself).' 'I patronized him,'\r\netc. (as on p. 158).\r\n\r\np. 158, n. 3, and p. 162, n. 1. Both notes are wrong. The place meant\r\nby Jahangir is Dizful, a town in the Khuzistan province of Persia,\r\nand Juyza is evidently a copyist's error for Khuz or Khuza, another\r\nname for Khuzistan. Dizful is an ancient name, and according to Yaqut,\r\nBarbier de Meynard's translation, p. 231, the proper spelling is\r\nDizpul, i.e. 'the Bridge of the Citadel,' the town being named after\r\na famous bridge built over the river. For Khuz see B. de Meynard, 216.\r\n\r\np. 160, l. 12 from foot. Qabulah was a town in the Bet Jalandhar Du'ab.\r\n\r\np. 163, l. 9. It is 2,000 rupees in I. O. MSS.\r\n\r\np. 163, l. 12. It is not Qacha Dakhani in I. O. MSS., but I am not\r\nsure what the clause, as given by them, means. No. 181 seems to have\r\nbafatahaigi for 'assistance' (?). Two B. M. MSS. have apparently\r\nbafatahai kapi, but Add. 26,215 has the Arabic ha, while Or. 3276\r\nhas the ordinary h, so that the words possibly mean 'the young of\r\nthe monkey' (kapi).\r\n\r\np. 166, l. 2. Husamu-d-din was married to Abu-l-fazl's sister,\r\nBlochmann, 441.\r\n\r\np. 167, l. 16. The word rojh in brackets is wrong. The MSS. have\r\nqara-quyragh and qara-quyragh. P. de Courteille gives quyrugh as\r\nmeaning a tail, so perhaps qara-quyrugh means a black-tailed sheep\r\nor deer. See p. 129, l. 17, where the qara-quyrugh is said to be\r\nthe chikara.\r\n\r\np. 168, last line. The MSS. has habs-i-mazid, which does not\r\nnecessarily mean imprisonment for life.\r\n\r\np. 170, n. 2. For Akbar's wives read Jahangir's wives.\r\n\r\np. 172, l. 21 seq. Is this the story referred to by Hawkins (Purchas),\r\nabout Muqarrab having taken a Banian's daughter?\r\n\r\np. 177, note. For one-third of an inch read one and a third inches.\r\n\r\np. 183, l. 8. This is the annular eclipse entered in Dr. R. Schramm's\r\nTables, Sewell's Indian Calendar, as having occurred on 5th December,\r\n1610, which corresponds to 28th Ramazan, 1019.\r\n\r\np. 185, n. 3. Persian text, p. 309, l. 11, has the phrase majra\r\ngirifta atash dadand, 'took aim and fired' (a cannon).\r\n\r\np. 188, l. 7 from foot. For Naziri, see Rieu, ii, 807b, and Blochmann,\r\n579. He died in 1622 (1613).\r\n\r\np. 191, l. 10. For dhik (?) read dhik, i.e. adjutant bird.\r\n\r\np. 191, l. 8. Patal means 'red' or 'rose-coloured' in Sanskrit. Query\r\n'red deer.'\r\n\r\np. 192, l. 2. Add year 1020.\r\n\r\np. 195, last line. The passage is rather obscure, but the meaning\r\nseems to be that though formalities are not regarded by the wise,\r\nyet weak persons (qawasir, which apparently is a plural of qasir),\r\nregard externals as the means of paying the dues of friendship (and\r\nso we must attend to them). Hence when at this auspicious time a\r\nprovince which had gone out of my (`Abbas's) possession has been\r\nsettled by the exertions of angelic servants in accordance with\r\nthe hopes of well-wishers, I (`Abbas) have returned to the capital,\r\nand have despatched Kamalu-d-din, etc.\r\n\r\np. 197, l. 7. For Khankhanan read Khan.\r\n\r\np. 197, l. 12. The I.O. MSS. have a different reading here. They say\r\nnothing about three ratis. What they say is, \"At this time I had made\r\nsome increase in the amounts of weights and measures. For instance,\r\nI added one-fourth (siwa'i) to the weight of the muhrs and rupees.\" The\r\nsih rati of text is a mistake for siwa'i.\r\n\r\np. 197, l. 12 from foot. I.O. MSS. have 'Sunday in Safar,' but they\r\nwrongly have 1022.\r\n\r\np. 197, l. 9 from foot. Both I.O. MSS. have 'Neknahar' instead of\r\n'in the interior.'\r\n\r\np. 198, l. 11. Or Lohgar.\r\n\r\np. 205, l. 14. I do not think that the translation 'should not force\r\nIslam on anyone,' or the version in Elliot, vi, 325, 'Not to forcibly\r\nimpose Musulman burdens on anyone,' gives the full force of the\r\nwords taklif-i-Musalmani bar kasi nakunand. I think the reference\r\nclearly is to circumcision, and that the words taklif-i-Musalmani\r\nshould be rendered 'the Muhammadan ceremonial.' This explains why the\r\ninjunction comes in immediately after the prohibitions against blinding\r\nand mutilation. It has been said, and I believe with truth, that the\r\nmembers of the Delhi royal family never were circumcised. Probably one\r\nreason for this was that in many instances they had Hindu mothers. As\r\npointed out in Elliot, the passage is omitted in the Iqbal-nama. It\r\nalso does not occur in the version given in `Ali Muhammad's \"History\r\nof Gujarat,\" vol. i, p. 200 of lithograph.\r\n\r\np. 214, verse. For red read a river.\r\n\r\np. 216. See picture of a turkey in Havell's \"Indian Sculpture,\"\r\npp. 214-15.\r\n\r\np. 218, l. 10 from foot. About Shapur see Ma'asiru-l-umara, i, 180.\r\n\r\np. 224, n. 1. For infra read supra, pp. 27 and 30, note.\r\n\r\np. 229, ll. 9 and 14. For Patna read Tatta.\r\n\r\np. 229, note. For brother read brother's son.\r\n\r\np. 231, l. 14 from foot. For Nihalpur substitute Thalner as in the\r\nMSS. The news of the death seems to have reached Agra very quickly.\r\n\r\np. 232, l. 1. Insert the word 'and' before 'allowed.'\r\n\r\np. 234, l. 2 from foot. The word translated 'cranes' is karwanak,\r\nand probably means 'a little crane.' In Blochmann, 63, karwanak is\r\nrendered by 'stone-curlew.'\r\n\r\np. 234, l. 5 from foot. The word seems to be kunjishk, 'sparrow,'\r\nin the MSS., but probably it should be kunjak, 'a curiosity, a rarity.'\r\n\r\np. 235, l. 2. It is Thursday, the 28th, in the MSS., and instead of\r\n'night' we should read 'eve.' The English date corresponding to 28th\r\nMuharram is 10th March, 1613.\r\n\r\np. 237, l. 8. It is 1,000 in the MSS., and this is probably correct,\r\nthough B.M. MS. 1645 has changed the word for 1,000 into one for\r\n100. The ordinary kaukab-i-tali` was 100 tolas in weight, see\r\np. 11. At p. 406 two kaukab-i-tali's are mentioned of 500 tolas\r\neach. It is a mistake, I think, to regard the word muhr as always\r\nimplying gold. The ordinary kaukab-i-tali` was of silver, and these\r\nlarge muhrs were no doubt also of silver. The note 1 to Elliott, vi,\r\n355, is probably incorrect.\r\n\r\np. 237, l. 10. 'The feast went off well,' etc. The passage is obscure,\r\nbut probably the translation should be 'There was a splendid assemblage\r\n(majis shigufta gasht), and after it was over I ordered that they\r\nshould arrange an illumination.' The words in text, p. 116, l. 3, are\r\nhukm kardam kih asbab u ayin bar kunand. The MSS. have asbab-i-ayin\r\nra. No. 181 seems to have baz kunand, and so has B.M. MS. 1645, but\r\nNo. 305 has bar kunand, as in text. It may be that the meaning is that\r\nJahangir told the servants they might appropriate the decorations,\r\nbut I rather think the order was to make an illumination. It may also\r\nsimply mean that he ordered the decorations to be taken down. Baz\r\nkunand ordinarily means 'to open out,' bar kunand 'to load.'\r\n\r\np. 237, l. 12. Delete 'the' before Muqarrab.\r\n\r\np. 237, note. I.O. MSS. seem to have zarin, 'golden'(?).\r\n\r\np. 241, l. 5 from foot. I.G., new ed., xvii, 309, speaks of a handsome\r\nmosque in Mairtha having been founded by Akbar, but probably it is\r\nthis one of Shaikh Pir. Perhaps Shaikh Pir is the old beggar referred\r\nto in Roe's Journal.\r\n\r\np. 247, l. 5 from foot. For chakri read jhakkar. It was not necessarily\r\na dust-storm.\r\n\r\np. 250, l. 6. The MSS. have Rup instead of Rawal, and so has Elliot,\r\nvi, 335. They have 'hill country of Mewat,' as in text. They have\r\nChitor, and not Jaipur, as in Elliot, and they make (by error)\r\nJahangir speak of the year as the 10th, instead of the 8th. Instead\r\nof 'have' at l. 12 we should read 'had,' and instead of 'from the\r\nRawal who was first known as Rawal,' they have, as also has Elliot,\r\n'Rahab, who was the first to take the title of Rana.' Rahab is the\r\nRahup of Tod, who says he came to the throne in 1201 A.D.\r\n\r\np. 253, ll. 10 and 11. I cannot find the word pulta-bazi. My friend,\r\nMr. Irvine, suggests that we should read patta bazi. Patta means a\r\n'foil,' or 'wooden sword,' and patta baz is given in Forbes as meaning\r\na 'fencer.' Paltha marna occurs in Forbes as meaning a 'peculiar\r\nposture.' The yaganagi of l. 11 should be yakangagi, meaning 'one\r\nbody,' or 'one limb,' and corresponds to the yakhath of Blochmann,\r\n252, both phrases meaning apparently 'that the fencer fights with\r\none hand,' that is, 'without using a shield.'\r\n\r\np. 260, l. 8. This I`tiqad is the father of Mumtaz-mahall, the wife\r\nof Shah Jahan. He now became Asaf Khan, and apparently the title of\r\nI`tiqad was transferred to his younger brother (or cousin?) Shahpur,\r\nwho was afterwards governor of Kashmir. See Ma'asir, i, 180. The\r\ntwo previous Asaf Khans of the family are Ghiyasu-d-din of Qazwin\r\n(Blochmann, 433), and Mirza Ja`far Beg, who was Ghiyasu-d-din's\r\nnephew. The father of Nur-Jahan was Ghiyas Beg of Tihran (Blochmann,\r\n508). Blochmann, in his Table, 512, has not mentioned Shahpur,\r\ni.e. the I`tiqad who became governor of Kashmir.\r\n\r\np. 261, l. 17 from foot. For mother read mothers (i.e. stepmothers).\r\n\r\np. 261, l. 10 from foot. For nephews read nephew.\r\n\r\np. 278, l. 13. For named read namad, and it should be in italics.\r\n\r\np. 281, l. 2. The permission to beat his drums is explained by the\r\nIqbal-nama, p. 79, where it is said that he was permitted to beat\r\nhis drums in the capital, dar pay-i-takht.\r\n\r\np. 281, l. 6 from foot. This eclipse is noted in Dr. Schram's Tables\r\nas occurring on 19th March, 1615.\r\n\r\np. 282, l. 10 from foot. Delete word 'Egyptian.'\r\n\r\np. 286, l. 6. For Frank read Venetian. Kar-i-Wanadik, as in MSS.\r\n\r\np. 288, l. 5. Chatur, instead of Tahayyur, in No. 305, and Bakhtar\r\n(?) in No. 181.\r\n\r\np. 293. According to the Iqbal-nama, 80, Kunwar Karan, son of Rana\r\nAmar Singh, became an officer of Jahangir, receiving the rank of 5,000\r\npersonal and horse. He was the first of the direct royal line of his\r\nfamily to accept office.\r\n\r\np. 293, l. 2 from foot. No. 181 has 102 horses.\r\n\r\np. 294, n. 2. No. 181 has Rasht.\r\n\r\np. 300, l. 18. According to Vullers' Dict., i, 482, a tulcha is 96\r\ngrains or about half a tola. The Ghiyasu-l-loghat, however, says that\r\ntulcha is merely the Persian form of the Hindustani tula. According to\r\nthe Burhan-i-qati' a tola is only 2 1/2 masha in Upper India. Generally\r\nit is reckoned as 12 masha. According to Sir Thomas Roe 2 1/2 tolas\r\nwere equal to 1 ounce.\r\n\r\np. 317, MS. No. 181 has A.H. date 1025.\r\n\r\np. 321, l. 11. For several bits read some marten skins. See Tuzuk text,\r\np. 308, l. 3 from foot, and Vullers' Dict, ii, 6. The MS. No. 181\r\nhas sad dana-i-kish, 'one hundred marten skins.'\r\n\r\np. 321, l. 13 from foot. For transit dues read for keeping open the\r\nPass (rah-dari).\r\n\r\np. 321, n. 2. The words in I.O. MSS. seem to be igana begana, which\r\nis perhaps a mere jingle on the word afghana, but may mean 'known,\r\nunknown.' Jahangir puns on the name Qadam, which means 'a foot,\r\na pace.' The words occur again at p. 323.\r\n\r\np. 322, last line. Probably `aqiri is, or is derived from, `aqar, which\r\nmeans a bird whose feathers were used for ornamentation. According\r\nto P. de Courteille, Turki Dict., 384, `aqar is a heron.\r\n\r\np. 328, l. 13 from foot. For Shah Shaja`at read Shah Shuja`. He was\r\nShah Jahan's second son, and was born at Ajmir on the eve of Sunday,\r\nand on 11th Tir. Apparently this corresponds to 24th June, 1616,\r\nwhich is the date of birth mentioned by Sir Thomas Roe. Beale's date\r\nof 12th May is wrong.\r\n\r\np. 332, l. 6 from foot. Here the word tulcha is used again, and\r\napparently as meaning the same thing as tola; 6,514 tulchas or tolas\r\nwould be about 82 sirs, or over 2 maunds and about 12 stone. Next year\r\nSir Thomas Roe saw Jahangir weighed, and he understood that his weight\r\nwas 9,000 rupees. If so, his weight would appear to have considerably\r\nincreased during the twelve months. Perhaps we should read 8,514,\r\ninstead of 6,514 tulchas. Hasht (8) and shash (6) are often confounded.\r\n\r\np. 341, l. 8 from foot. For times read days, the word ruz (days)\r\nhaving been omitted from the text.\r\n\r\np. 344, n. 1. Apparently we should read Toda. The difference between\r\nit and Nauda is, in Persian writing, only one dot. Toda is mentioned\r\nby Roe as the place where he overtook Jahangir, and the stages given\r\nby him come to 21 kos, counting from Ramsar, and this agrees very\r\nnearly with Jahangir's stages from the same place.\r\n\r\np. 351, l. 15 from foot. The MS. No. 181 has the word gaz twice,\r\nand makes the pahna'i, or width, 175 1/2 gaz (yards).\r\n\r\np. 351, last line. For Bulghari read Pulkhari.\r\n\r\np. 352, l. 1. Delete the words 'of Tir.' The month was Bahman,\r\ncorresponding to January-February, 1617, and 23rd Bahman would be\r\nabout 1st February. In Sayyid Ahmad's edition the word Tir is a\r\nmistake for niz, 'also,' the meaning being that the 23rd was a halt\r\nas well as the 22nd.\r\n\r\np. 353, l. 2. Ghaznin Khan is mentioned by Finch under the name of\r\nGidney Khan, and he is said to have been originally a Hindu. But this\r\nseems doubtful, as his father's name is given in the Mir'at-i-Ahmadi\r\nas Malik Khanji Afghan. See also Bayley's \"Gujarat,\" p. 15. Jalor is\r\nnow in Jodhpur. It is described by Finch.\r\n\r\np. 353, l. 2. This seems to be the case of matricide mentioned in\r\nTerry's \"Voyage,\" p. 362, of ed. of 1777. His statement that it\r\noccurred at Ahmadabad is presumably an oversight. Terry says the\r\nmatricide was put to death by being bitten by two snakes. See also\r\nIrvine's \"Manucci,\" iv, 422. Apparently the punishment recorded by\r\nJahangir took place on the 4th February, for Sir Thomas Roe mentions\r\nthat they reached Kaliyadaha, the next stage, on 6th February. The bi\r\nin biyasa should be deleted. Jalaur, or Jalor, is in Jodhpur (I.G.,\r\nxiv, 29). It used to be in Ajmir. It is not quite clear if Terry was\r\nwith Roe at Kaliyadaha, but if not he was with him at Ujjain. The\r\nexecution may have taken place there.\r\n\r\np. 355, l. 16. For 'from the city of Ujjain,' etc., read 'to a rural\r\nspot near the city of Ujjain.'\r\n\r\np. 360, l. 22. For 128 1/4 cubits read 28 1/4 cubits. I.O. MS. 181\r\nhas 28 1/4 yards. The printed text of Sayyid Ahmad has 128 1/4 cubits.\r\n\r\np. 362, l. 8 from foot. Delete (Balchha?).\r\n\r\np. 373, l. 11 seq. This I`tiqad was the younger brother or perhaps\r\ncousin of Asaf Khan, the brother of Nur-Jahan. He was also known as\r\nShahpur. See Ma'asiru-l-umara, i, 180.\r\n\r\np. 375, n. 2. Read two diamonds.\r\n\r\np. 406, n. 3. Dikhtan or Daikhtan seems right. It is so in both the\r\nI.O. MSS.\r\n\r\np. 406, l. 11 from foot. These muhrs were probably of silver, and were\r\ncalled muhrs because they were medals rather than coins. Dr. Kehr\r\nhas given an account of a large muhr which is now apparently in\r\nDresden. See also Richardson's Dict., article Sikka.\r\n\r\np. 407, l. 4. This is Juna Khan, son of Ghiyasu-d-din Tughluq. He\r\nascended the throne in 1325 under the title of Muhammad bin Tughluq.\r\n\r\np. 407, l. 15. This is the prince known as Nasiru-d-din. He ascended\r\nthe throne as Muhammad bin Firuz in 1387, and again in 1390.\r\n\r\np. 413, ll. 11 and 3 from foot. I.O. MSS. show that Sar-faraz should\r\nbe Sarafraz; apparently his present was 'seven bullock-carts' (haft\r\nras gaw bahal) and not two bullocks.\r\n\r\np. 417, n. 2. Cancel note. Narangsar seems right.\r\n\r\np. 417, l. 2 from foot. The words are dah bist wazn muhr u rupiya\r\nma`mul. Elliot, p. 354, renders this 'ten and twenty times heavier\r\nthan the current gold muhr and rupee.'\r\n\r\np. 418, l. 10. See n. 2 in Elliot, vi, 355. Apparently Jahangir\r\nmeans that he was the first person to coin double muhrs and double\r\nrupees. There is an account of tankas in the Bahar-i-`Ajam, 261,\r\ncol 2, p. 421, n. 2. But it is 27 in I.O. MSS. 113, p. 423, l. 14. A\r\ntassu is more than a finger-breadth, it is the 1/24 of a gaz or yard,\r\nand should be about 1 1/3 inches.\r\n\r\np. 437. I am indebted to my friend Dr. Hoernle for the explanation\r\nof the names of the two sects of Sewras. They should be Tapa and\r\nKharatara. Man Singh's name in religion was Jin-simha. See Epigraphia\r\nIndica, i, 37, and Ind. Antiquary, xi, 250. Man Singh died at Mairtha\r\n(in Jodhpur) according to the Jain books, in the beginning of 1618. The\r\nhead of the Tapa sect in Jahangir's time was Vijayasena. There is an\r\nelaborate paper on the Jains of Gujarat and Marwar by Colonel Miles\r\nin the Transactions R.A.S., iii, pp. 335-71.\r\n\r\np. 442, l. 8. There is no previous reference to the outbreak of plague\r\nin Kashmir, though there is one to its occurrence in the Panjab. There\r\nis an interesting account of the plague in Khafi Khan, i, 286-8,\r\nin which the description is carried down to the time of Aurangzib.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] It is owing to the crabbed writing of Price's MS. that at p. 21\r\nJahangir is made to say that the Prince of Kashmir belonged to the\r\nsociety of Jogis. The real statement is that the prince belonged to\r\nthe Chak family.\r\n\r\n[2] A translation was begun by the Rev. Mr. Lowe for the Asiatic\r\nSociety of Bengal, but only one fasciculus was published. This was\r\nin 1889.\r\n\r\n[3] That is, he was 37 years 3 months by the lunar calendar, and\r\n36 years 1 month by solar reckoning (Padshahnama, i, 69). Elliot\r\nand all the MSS. have 8th Jumada-s-sani as the date of the\r\naccession, but this is clearly wrong, as Akbar did not die till 13th\r\nJumada-s-sani. Evidently the copyists have, as is so often the case,\r\nmisread bistam as hashtam. See Blochmann's remark, p. 454, note 3. That\r\nJahangir was not at this time 38 is shown by his stating at p. 37 that\r\nhe celebrated his 38th birthday at Lahore after the capture of Khusrau.\r\n\r\n[4] The Sanskrit Kalinda.\r\n\r\n[5] The couplet appears in Mas`ud's divan, B.M. MS. Egerton, 701,\r\np. 142a, line 4. The preceding lines show that the dust (gard) referred\r\nto in the first line means the dust caused by the invading army. I\r\ntake the words baru barhai to mean the battlements or pinnacles of\r\nthe fortress, the i at the end of barha being intensive.\r\n\r\n[6] Erskine's manuscript translation of the Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri,\r\nB.M. MS. Add. 26,611, and the B.M. MS. have chini, not habshi. But\r\nI.O. MS. No. 181 and the R.A.S. MS. have husaini, and this seems\r\nright. See Memoirs, Leyden & Erskine, p. 326, and the Haidarabad\r\nTurki text, p. 284. The kishmishi is a small grape like that of which\r\ncurrants are made.\r\n\r\n[7] Cf. infra the account of the 11th year, p. 173.\r\n\r\n[8] See Memoirs. L. & E., p. 330.\r\n\r\n[9] The name rae bel is not given in Clarke's Roxburgh, but perhaps it\r\nis one of the jessamines, and may be the bela of Clarke (p. 30). The\r\nrae bel is described by Abu-l-fazl (Blochmann, pp. 76 and 82). The\r\nstatement about its flowers being double and treble is obscure. Erskine\r\nrenders the passage \"The leaves are generally two and three fold.\" The\r\nPersian word is tabaqa, which apparently is equivalent to the tui or\r\nfold of the Ayin-i-Akbari, Persian text, i, 96. The reference may be\r\nto the flowers growing in umbels.\r\n\r\n[10] This is the bokul of Indian gardens (Clarke, p. 313), and well\r\ndeserves Jahangir's praise. It is probably the bholsari mentioned in\r\nthe Ayin (Blochmann, No. 10, p. 83). Blochmann gives bholsiri (p. 70)\r\nas the name of a fruit-tree, and the bholsari of p. 83 maybe a mistake\r\nfor mulsari.\r\n\r\n[11] The text has sewti, but the sewti seems to be the Rosa\r\nglandulifera of Roxburgh (Clarke, p. 407) and has no resemblance\r\nto the Pandanus. See also the description of the sewti, Blochmann,\r\np. 82. (Perhaps there are two sewtis, one famous for fragrance, the\r\nother for beauty. See l.c., pp. 76 and 82.) What is meant in the\r\ntext is evidently a Pandanus and the ketki of Blochmann, p. 83. I\r\nhave followed, therefore, I.O. MS. 181, and have substituted ketki\r\nfor sewti. The ketki may be Pandanus inermis, which has no thorns\r\n(Clarke, p. 708). Erskine also has ketki.\r\n\r\n[12] L.c. p. 33 et seq.\r\n\r\n[13] Du Jarric, who got his information from missionary reports,\r\nseems to imply that the chain was of silver, and says that Jahangir\r\nwas following the idea of an old Persian king. It is mentioned in\r\nthe Siyar al-muta'akhkhirin (reprint, i, 230) that Muhammad Shah in\r\n1721 revived this, and hung a long chain with a bell attached to it\r\nfrom the octagon tower which looked towards the river.\r\n\r\n[14] In text this is wrongly made part of regulation 2.\r\n\r\n[15] Gladwin and the MSS. have dilbahra (exhilarating drink), and\r\nthis is probably correct. Jahangir would know little about rice-spirit.\r\n\r\n[16] This regulation is more fully expounded in Price, p. 7.\r\n\r\n[17] It is curious that Jahangir should give the 18th Rabi`u-l-awwal\r\nas his birthday, while the authorities give it as the 17th. Probably\r\nthe mistake has arisen from Jahangir's writing Rabi`u-l-awwal instead\r\nof Shahriwar. His birthday was Rashn the 18th day of Shahriwar (see\r\nAkbarnama, ii, 344), but it was the 17th Rabi`u-l-awwal. See Muhammad\r\nHadi's preface, p. 2, and Beale, and Jahangir's own statement a few\r\nlines above. Possibly Jahangir wished to make out that he was born on\r\nthe 18th Rabi`u-l-awwal and a Thursday, because he regarded Thursday\r\nas a blessed day (mubarak shamba), whilst he regarded Wednesday as\r\npeculiarly unlucky, and called it kam, or gam, shamba.\r\n\r\n[18] Cf. Elliot's translation, vi, 513, and note 2.\r\n\r\n[19] The MSS. have \"the subsistence lands of people in general (ahali)\r\nand the aimas.\"\r\n\r\n[20] In the text and in Elliot, vi, 515, this is made a separate order,\r\nbut it is not so in the MSS. If it were, we should have thirteen\r\ninstead of twelve regulations. This is avoided in text and in Elliot\r\nby putting the 8th and 7th regulations into one ordinance. With regard\r\nto the regulation about releasing the prisoners, Sir Henry Elliot is\r\nsomewhat unjust to Jahangir in his commentary at p. 515. It was only\r\nthose who had been long imprisoned whom Jahangir released, and his\r\nproceedings at Ranthambhor in the 13th year (Tuzuk, p. 256) show that\r\nhe exercised discrimination in releasing prisoners. The account in\r\nPrice, p. 10, may also be consulted. There Jahangir says he released\r\n7,000 men from Gwalior alone. It may be remembered that most of these\r\nwere political offenders. Private criminals were for the most part\r\nput to death, or mutilated, or fined. There were no regular jails.\r\n\r\n[21] The above translation of the Institutes should be compared with\r\nSir Henry Elliot's translation and his commentary: History of India,\r\nE. & D., vol. vi, Appendix, p. 493.\r\n\r\n[22] Erskine's MS. has isari for nisari, and akhtar-i-qabul instead\r\nof khair-i-qabul.\r\n\r\n[23] This is Blochmann's Asaf Khan No. iii, viz. Mirza Ja`far Beg. See\r\npp. 368 and 411.\r\n\r\n[24] The words Aftab-i-Mamlakat yield, according to the numeration\r\nby abjad, the date 1014 A.H. (1605).\r\n\r\n[25] Page 4 of the text is followed by engravings of the coins of\r\nJahangir and the inscriptions thereon, for which the editor, Saiyid\r\nAhmad, says he is indebted to Mr. Thornhill, the Judge of Meerut. They\r\ndo not show the lines of poetry. There is an interesting article on\r\nthe couplets on Jahangir's coins by Mr. C. J. Rodgers, J.A.S.B. for\r\n1888, p. 18.\r\n\r\n[26] The chronogram is ingenious. The words Sahib-Qiran-i-Sani yield\r\nonly 1013 according to abjad, and this is a year too little. But the\r\nverse states that Prosperity (or Fortune), Iqbal, laid his head at the\r\nsecond lord of conjunction's feet, and the head of Iqbal, according to\r\nthe parlance of chronogram-composers, is the first letter of the word,\r\nthat is, alif, which stands for one (A) in abjad, and so the date 1014\r\nis made up. Sahib-Qiran-i-Sani means 'the second lord of conjunction,'\r\nand is a title generally applied to Shah Jahan; the first lord of\r\nconjunction (i.e the conjunction of Jupiter and Venus) was Timur.\r\n\r\n[27] A great officer under Humayun and Akbar. See Ayin, Blochmann,\r\np. 317.\r\n\r\n[28] Blochmann, p. 331. He had 1,200 eunuchs. He is generally\r\nstyled Sa`id Chaghatai. The exact nature of his relationship does\r\nnot appear. It is not mentioned in his biography in the Ma'asir, ii,\r\n403. Perhaps the word (nisbat) does not here mean affinity by marriage.\r\n\r\n[29] According to the account in Price, p. 16, and in the Ma'asir,\r\nii, 405, Sa`id Khan gave a bond that if his people were oppressive\r\nhe would forfeit his head.\r\n\r\n[30] He does not seem to have had any real power, and he was soon\r\nsuperseded. See Ma'asir, iii, 932.\r\n\r\n[31] It appears from Erskine and from I.O. MS. that this is a\r\nmistake for Yatish-begi, 'Captain of the Watch,' and that the name\r\nis Aminu-d-din, and not Aminu-d-daula. See Akbarnama, iii, 474, etc.\r\n\r\n[32] Sharif Khan had been sent by Akbar to recall Jahangir to his\r\nduty, but instead of coming back he stayed on. He did not accompany\r\nJahangir when the latter went off the second time to wait upon his\r\nfather. Probably he was afraid to do so. Jahangir appointed him to\r\nBihar before he left Allahabad to visit his father for the second\r\ntime. Jahangir says Sharif waited upon him fifteen days after his\r\naccession, and on 4th Rajab. This is another proof, if proof were\r\nneeded, that the copyists have misread the opening sentence of the\r\nTuzuk and have written hashtam instead of bistam, for 4th Rajab is\r\nfifteen days after 20th Jumada-l-akhir. The Padshahnama and Khafi\r\nKhan have 20th, and Price and Price's original say that Sharif arrived\r\nsixteen days after the accession.\r\n\r\n[33] I.O. MS. 181 and Muhammad Hadi have Sultan Nisar Begam. Khafi\r\nKhan, i, 245, has Sultan Begam, and says she was born in 994. Price's\r\nJahangir, p. 20, says she was born a year before Khusrau. She built a\r\ntomb for herself in the Khusrau Bagh, Allahabad, but she is not buried\r\nthere (see J.R.A.S. for July, 1907, p. 607). She died on 4th Sha`ban,\r\n1056 (5th September, 1646), and was at her own request buried in her\r\ngrandfather's tomb at Sikandra (Padshahnama, ii, 603-4).\r\n\r\n[34] Should be Shaikhawat.\r\n\r\n[35] The R.A.S. and I.O. MSS. have here Umra instead of Uzbegs. Umra\r\nhere stands, I think, for Umr Singh, the Rana of Udaipur, and the\r\nmeaning is that Shir Khan lost his arm in service against the Rana.\r\n\r\n[36] The point of the verse seems to be that light is regarded as\r\nsomething spread like a carpet on the ground, and that to place\r\nthe foot upon it is to insult the sun. Compare Price, p. 33; but\r\nManohar's verse is wrongly translated there owing to a badly written\r\nMS. For Manohar see Akbarnama, iii, 221, and Badayuni, iii, 201,\r\nalso Blochmann, p. 494, and his article in Calcutta Review for April,\r\n1871, also the Dabistan, translation, ii, 53.\r\n\r\n[37] Probably here ab means both water and the water of the\r\nsword. These lines are not in the R.A.S. or I.O. MSS.\r\n\r\n[38] Text, ihtiyat (caution); the MSS. have i`tiqad (confidence),\r\nand I adopt this reading.\r\n\r\n[39] Blochmann, p. 52. It was a small round seal. Uzuk or uzuk is a\r\nTartar word meaning a ring, i.e. a signet-ring.\r\n\r\n[40] Text, sabiyya (daughter), and this led Blochmann (p. 477, note\r\n2) to say that if Sayyid Ahmad's text was correct Jahangir must have\r\nforgotten, in the number of his wives, which of them was the mother\r\nof Parwiz. As a fact, Sayyid Ahmad's text is not correct, though\r\nthe R.A.S. MS. agrees with it. The two excellent I.O. MSS. have\r\nkhwish (relative), which is here equivalent to cousin. So also has\r\nthe B.M. MS. used by Erskine. According to Muhammad Hadi's preface\r\nParwiz's mother was the daughter of Khwaja Hasan, the paternal uncle\r\nof Zain Khan Koka. His birth was in Muharram, 998, or 19th Aban\r\n(November, 1589). See also Akbarnama, iii, 568.\r\n\r\n[41] I.e., both were Akbar's foster-brothers.\r\n\r\n[42] Price, p. 20, has Karmitty, and says the daughter only lived two\r\nmonths. Karamsi appears twice in the Akbarnama as the name of a man;\r\nsee Akbarnama, ii, 261, and iii, 201. The name may mean 'composed of\r\nkindness.' The statement in Price is wrong. Bihar Banu was married\r\nto Tahmuras s. Prince Daniyal in his 20th year (see Tuzuk, M. Hadi's\r\ncontinuation, p. 400). According to M. Hadi's preface, Karamsi was\r\nthe daughter of Raja Kesho Das Rathor, and her daughter Bihar Banu\r\nwas born on 23rd Shahriwar, 998 (September, 1590). Kesho Das Rathor\r\nis probably the Kesho Das Maru of the Tuzuk.\r\n\r\n[43] Best known as Jodh Bai (Blochmann, p. 619).\r\n\r\n[44] It is extraordinary that Jahangir should have put Shah-Jahan's\r\nbirth into A.H. 999. The I.O. MSS. support the text, but the\r\nR.A.S. MS. has A.H. 1000, which is without doubt right. Cf. Akbarnama,\r\nBib. Ind., iii, 603. Later on, a great point was made of his having\r\nbeen born in a millennium. The date is 5th January, 1592.\r\n\r\n[45] Muhammad Hadi says in his preface, p. 6, that Shah-Jahan's\r\ngrandfather Akbar gave him the name of Sultan Khurram, 'Prince Joy,'\r\nbecause his birth made the world glad. It was noted that the child\r\nwas born in the first millennium, and also that, like his father,\r\nhe was born in the same month as the Prophet.\r\n\r\n[46] Gladwin says they were twins, but this seems a mistake. They\r\nwere both born about the time of Akbar's death.\r\n\r\n[47] In MS. No. 310 of Ethé's Cat. of I.O. MSS. Sa`id Khan is described\r\nas giving as his reason for asking for M. Ghazi that he had adopted\r\nhim as his son. Price's Jahangir, p. 21, says the same thing.\r\n\r\n[48] This should be Jan, and is so in I.O. MS. 181.\r\n\r\n[49] See Ma'asiru-l-umara, iii, 932. The meaning of the half and half\r\nis that the two men were made coadjutors.\r\n\r\n[50] In R.A.S. and I.O. MSS. the following passage is a verse. See\r\nalso Mr. Lowe's translation, p. 16.\r\n\r\n[51] Wird means 'daily practice,' and may be the word intended here.\r\n\r\n[52] Cf. this with the fuller details in Price, p. 22. Following\r\nBlochmann, I take Shab-i-jum`a to mean Thursday and not Friday night.\r\n\r\n[53] The text has `Abdu-l-Ghani, but this, as the MSS. show and\r\nBlochmann has pointed out, is a mistake for `Abdu-n-Nabi. `Abdu-n-Nabi\r\nwas strangled, and the common report is that this was done by\r\nAbu-l-fazl. If this be true it is rather surprising that Jahangir does\r\nnot mention it as an excuse for killing Abu-l-fazl. Cf. the account\r\nof Miran Sadr Jahan in Price, p. 24. The \"Forty Sayings\" is a book\r\nby Jami. See Rieu, Cat. i, 17, and also Dr. Herbelot s.v. Arbain.\r\n\r\n[54] This should be Ghiyas Beg. He was father of Nurjahan. According to\r\nthe Ma'asiru-l-umara (i, 129), he was commander of 1,000 under Akbar.\r\n\r\n[55] Topkhana-i-rikab, lit. stirrup-arsenal. It means light artillery\r\nthat could accompany royal progresses. See Bernier, and Irvine,\r\nA. of M., 134.\r\n\r\n[56] Text, topchi, which seems properly to mean a gunner, but\r\nthe number is preposterous. Cf. Blochmann, p. 470, and Price,\r\np. 28. Price's original has 6,000 topchi mounted on camels, and has\r\npaytakht, i.e. the capital. Erskine has \"To have always in readiness\r\nin the arsenal arms, and accoutrements for 50,000 matchlock men.\" This\r\nseems reasonable, for even if Jahangir ordered 50,000 musketeers, he\r\nwould not have required them to be kept in the arsenal. It seems to\r\nme that though chi in Turki is the sign of the agent (nomen agentis)\r\nit is occasionally used by Indian writers as a diminutive. Thus topchi\r\nhere probably means a small gun or a musket, and in Hindustani we are\r\nfamiliar with the word chilamchi, which means a small basin. At p. 301\r\nof the Tuzuk, four lines from foot, we have the word ilchi, which\r\ncommonly means an ambassador--an agent of a people--used certainly\r\nnot in this sense, and apparently to mean a number of horses. It is,\r\nhowever, doubtful if ilchi here be the true reading.\r\n\r\n[57] Text, aknun (now), which is a mistake for altun (gold). See Elliot\r\nand Dowson, vi, 288. Al is vermilion in Turki and altun gold. Jahangir\r\nmeans that he changed the name from al tamgha to altun tamgha.\r\n\r\n[58] Mirza Sultan was great-grandson of Sulaiman.\r\n\r\n[59] Perhaps the reference is to the boy's own father. He was alive\r\nat this time, and Akbar was not.\r\n\r\n[60] This is the man who afterwards rebelled and made Jahangir his\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\n[61] Text, ulus-i-Dihli. Blochmann (p. 482 n.) points out that this\r\nis a very doubtful term, as Mirza `Ali came from Badakhshan. On\r\nexamining three MSS. of the Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri I find no word Dihli,\r\nbut the words in ulus, 'this tribe or family,' and I think this must\r\nbe the correct reading, and refers to the Timurides. The same phrase\r\noccurs at text, p. 173. Blochmann suggests to read Dulday for Dihli,\r\nbut I think it more probable that the word Dihli should be `ali. Mirza\r\n`Ali was styled Akbarshahi, and no doubt this is why Jahangir writes\r\nin ulus or ulus-i-`ali. Mirza `Ali is often mentioned in the Akbarnama\r\nin connection with the wars in the Deccan, and is generally called\r\nAkbarshahi, e.g. at p. 702. For an account of his pathetic death see\r\nBlochmann, l.c., the Ma'asiru-l-umara, iii, 357, and the text, p. 163.\r\n\r\n[62] The MSS. have a different reading, \"If a king seize country and\r\nclimes,\" etc.\r\n\r\n[63] Shahrukh was married to Jahangir's half-sister, Shakaru-n-nisa. He\r\nwas a Timurid.\r\n\r\n[64] The MSS. have Abu-l-wali, and this seems more likely.\r\n\r\n[65] The MSS. have Bhina, and Price's original seems also to have\r\nBhina. Muqarrab did not return for about seven months, as this entry\r\ncould not have been made till then. See p. 35 of Persian text of Tuzuk.\r\n\r\n[66] Text, Sukhunan-i-past u buland. Cf. Steingass, s.v. past. Words\r\ngentle and severe seem meant.\r\n\r\n[67] See Blochmann, p. 447. He is mentioned by Du Jarric as disputing\r\nwith the Catholic priests before Jahangir (see J.A.S.B. for\r\n1896, p. 77). According to Badayuni, iii, 98, it was Naqib's\r\nfather, `Abdu-l-Latif, with whom Akbar read (see Akbarnama, ii,\r\n19). `Abdu-l-Latif and his family arrived in 963 (1556). Erskine\r\nunderstands Jahangir's remark to mean that Naqib was his (Jahangir's)\r\nteacher, but probably Jahangir means that it was Naqib's father who\r\ntaught Akbar, or he has confounded the father and son. As Naqib lived\r\ntill 1023 (1614), he would probably be too young in 1556 to have been\r\nAkbar's teacher.\r\n\r\n[68] Man Singh was the adopted son of Bhagwan Das, and it would appear\r\nfrom this passage that he was his nephew also.\r\n\r\n[69] The MSS. have Hatim s. Babui Mangli, and this is right. See\r\nBlochmann, p. 370, n. i, and p. 473.\r\n\r\n[70] The MSS. have Shahwar.\r\n\r\n[71] I.O. MSS. have Abu-l-wali. He was an Uzbeg, and received the\r\ntitle of Bahadur Khan. See Ma asiru-l-umara, i, 400, and Akbarnama,\r\niii, 820 and 839, where he is called Abu-l-Baqa. The real name seems\r\nto be Abul Be or Bey, and this is how Erskine writes the name.\r\n\r\n[72] The text seems corrupt. The I.O. MSS. say nothing about Shiraz,\r\nbut merely that Husain Jami was a disciple who had a dervish character\r\n(sirat); nor does the R.A.S. MS. mention Shiraz.\r\n\r\n[73] That is, descended from the famous Central Asian saint Khwaja\r\nAhrar.\r\n\r\n[74] Something seems to have fallen out of the text and MSS.,\r\nfor this passage is obscure and not connected with the context. It\r\nis clearer in Price's version, where it is brought in as part of\r\nJahangir's statements about promotions, and where (p. 40) we read\r\nas follows:--\"I shall now return to the more grateful subject of\r\nrecording rewards and advancements.... On Khwaja Zakariyya, the\r\nson of Khwaja Muhammad Yahya, although in disgrace, I conferred the\r\nrank of 500. This I was induced to do on the recommendation of the\r\nvenerated Shaikh Husain Jami. Six months previous to my accession,\"\r\netc. Evidently the statement about Zakariyya's promotion has been\r\nomitted accidentally from the Tuzuk. There is a reference to the\r\nShaikh's dream in Muhammad Hadi's preface to the Tuzuk (p. 15). He\r\nsays there that it was the saint Baha'u-l-haqq who appeared in a\r\ndream to Husain Jami and told him that Sultan Salim would soon be king.\r\n\r\n[75] I.e. of Furj or Furg in Persia. But Furji is a mistake for Qurchi\r\n(belonging to the body-guard). He was a Mogul. See Blochmann, p. 457.\r\n\r\n[76] Text has wrongly Pakhta. See Blochmann, p. 469. He received the\r\ntitle of Sardar Khan.\r\n\r\n[77] Should be Namakin. See Blochmann, p. 199.\r\n\r\n[78] This passage has been translated by Elliot (vi, 289). See also\r\nPrice (p. 44), where the discussion is fuller.\r\n\r\n[79] Jahangir's idea is somewhat vaguely expressed, but his meaning\r\nseems to be that the ten incarnations do not illustrate any attribute\r\nof God, for there have been men who performed similar wonders. The\r\ncorresponding passage in the text used by Major Price is differently\r\nrendered by him, but his version is avowedly a paraphrase, and it\r\nappears incorrect in this passage.\r\n\r\n[80] Literally, \"of the How and the Why.\"\r\n\r\n[81] Text, shir-andam, 'tiger-shaped,' which I think means thin in\r\nthe flank (see Steingass, s.v.). I have taken the translation of\r\nthe words malahat and sabahat from Elliot. See his note vi, 376,\r\nwhere the two words seem wrongly spelt.\r\n\r\n[82] Erskine has \"Let Sulaiman place his ring on his finger.\"\r\n\r\n[83] Price translates--\r\n\r\n   \"In pleasure of the chase with thee, my soul breathes fresh\r\n                                                           and clear;\r\n    But who receives thy fatal dart, sinks lifeless on his bier.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[84] Perhaps referring to the name which Daniyal gave to his gun,\r\nand which recoiled on himself, but the MSS. and text have nagirad,\r\nand not bagirad.\r\n\r\n[85] The MSS. have Shakar-nisar, 'sugar-sprinkling.' She lived into\r\nShah-Jahan's reign.\r\n\r\n[86] She died unmarried in Jahangir's reign.\r\n\r\n[87] This must, I think, be the meaning, though according to the\r\nwording the statement would seem to be that there is no room for Shias\r\nexcept in Persia. Erskine has \"None but Shias are tolerated in Persia,\r\nSunnis in Rum and Turan, and Hindus in Hindustan.\"\r\n\r\n[88] Kings are regarded as shadows of God.\r\n\r\n[89] The chronogram is one year short, yielding 962 instead of 963.\r\n\r\n[90] According to the Tabaqat, Elliot, v, 366, what the Mirza said was\r\n\"Where are the elephants?\"\r\n\r\n[91] The word for 'face-guard' is pish-ruy (front-face), and Jahangir\r\nmakes his father pun upon the word, saying, \"It has loosed (opened)\r\nmy front-face.\" Cf. Price, p. 54.\r\n\r\n[92] 'The helper.' This is an allusion to Akbar's patron saint,\r\nMu`inu-d-din Chishti, whose name he adopted as his battle-cry.\r\n\r\n[93] The reading in the lithograph seems wrong; the MSS. have az\r\nbazicha, 'in jest.'\r\n\r\n[94] Abu-l-fazl is more moderate; he says (Blochmann, p. 116) that\r\nAkbar killed 1,019 animals with Sangram.\r\n\r\n[95] Blochmann says, of Mashhad, p. 381.\r\n\r\n[96] The furriery. See Blochmann, pp. 87 n. and 616. Kurk means 'fur'\r\nin Turki.\r\n\r\n[97] The word yatish is omitted in text, but occurs in the MSS.\r\n\r\n[98] Haji Koka was sister of Sa`adat Yar Koka (Akbar-nama, iii,\r\n656). According to Price this passage refers to a widows' fund.\r\n\r\n[99] This was one of Akbar's regulations (Blochmann p. 142). The\r\namount was ten dams on each muhr of the horse's value, calculated on\r\nan increase of 50 per cent. See also Price, p. 61.\r\n\r\n[100] This passage is not clear, but the peculiarity to which\r\nattention is drawn seems rather the prominent forehead than the oozing\r\nfluid. Price (p. 62) has a fuller account of this elephant.\r\n\r\n[101] See Blochmann, pp. 176, 452, and the very full account of him\r\nin the Ma'asir, iii, 285. Amul is an old city south of the Caspian\r\nand west of Astrabad.\r\n\r\n[102] She was Akbar's first and principal wife, but bore him no\r\nchildren. She long survived him.\r\n\r\n[103] These are the opening lines of an ode of Hafiz.\r\n\r\n[104] Ma'asiru-l-umara. Yatim instead of Pim or Bim. See Blochmann,\r\np. 470. Erskine has Sain Bahadur.\r\n\r\n[105] MS. 181 has 34.\r\n\r\n[106] I think Jahangir means that though the Khan was an excellent\r\nservant in his own line, he was hardly fit for the command of 2,000\r\nor for the title of Khan. Cf. his praise of him at p. 71 (Blochmann,\r\np. 498). He was called Pishrau probably from his going on ahead with\r\nthe advance camp, as being in charge of the carpets, etc., as well\r\nas because of his personal activity.\r\n\r\n[107] In Price's Jahangir, p. 15, Jahangir states that he had\r\nimprisoned Khusrau in the upper part of the royal tower in the castle\r\nof Agra. It from this confinement that Khusrau escaped.\r\n\r\n[108] Du Jarric says it was in this way that he was allowed to pass\r\nthe sentinels. Du Jarric gives the date of Khusrau's flight as 15th\r\nApril, 1606 (this would be New Style). By Sunday night is meant\r\nSaturday evening. Sunday was Akbar's birthday.\r\n\r\n[109] Elliot (vii, 292) makes the Amiru-l-umara envious of his\r\npeers, and Jahangir apprehensive lest he should destroy Khusrau,\r\nbut he had just told him that nothing he did against Khusrau would\r\nbe wrong. Clearly Jahangir's fear was that his favourite should be\r\ndestroyed by Khusrau, or perhaps by the Amir's treacherous associates.\r\n\r\n[110] The text has a curious mistake here: instead of ba Kabul it has\r\nbakawal ('superintendent of the kitchen') as part of Dust Muhammad's\r\nname. Dust was not bakawal, but held higher office, and was later\r\nput in charge of the fort of Agra and given the title of Khwaja Jahan.\r\n\r\n[111] Price, p. 6, note.\r\n\r\n[112] According to Khafi Khan (i, 250) he was put to death, unless\r\nthe expression \"claws of death\" is merely rhetorical. The Ma'asir\r\n(iii, 334) says he was imprisoned.\r\n\r\n[113] The above obscure passage is explained in Price, p. 69.\r\n\r\n[114] Elliot (vi, 293) observes that this is a very involved and\r\nobscure passage.\r\n\r\n[115] Blochmann, p. 418.\r\n\r\n[116] The word tiryaq means both opium and antidote.\r\n\r\n[117] Blochmann, relying on Khafi Khan, puts her death in 1011,\r\nand the Akbar-nama (iii, 826) puts it in 1012. The chronogram in the\r\nKhusrau Bagh yields 1012. See J.R.A.S. for July, 1907, p. 604.\r\n\r\n[118] Where Lord Bellomont died in 1656. See Manucci (Irvine), i, 71.\r\n\r\n[119] Probably this means the grandsons. At p. 329 it is mentioned\r\nthat the grandsons had been confined in Gwalior up to the 16th year.\r\n\r\n[120] Para, qu. 'a heap'?\r\n\r\n[121] Narela is said to be 15 1/2 miles north-west of Delhi. William\r\nFinch, in his itinerary, mentions the stage as Nalera, a name that\r\ncorresponds with Jahangir's.\r\n\r\n[122] 53 miles north of Delhi.\r\n\r\n[123] Instead of taza the MSS. have para, and the meaning seems to\r\nbe that he accompanied Khusrau for some distance. In Price's Jahangir\r\n(p. 81) it is said that Nizam received 6,000 rupees.\r\n\r\n[124] This is an interesting passage, because it is Jahangir's account\r\nof his father's 'Divine Faith.' But it is obscure, and copyists seem\r\nto have made mistakes. It is explained somewhat by the MS. used by\r\nPrice (trans., pp. 82, 83), where more details are given than in the\r\ntext. It is there stated that Ahmad was Mir-i-`Adl of Jahangir before\r\nthe latter's accession.\r\n\r\n[125] The text has dast u sina (hand and bosom), but the correct\r\nwords, as is shown in the I.O. MS., No. 181, are shast u shabiha or\r\nshabah, and these refer to the ring or token and the portrait given\r\nby Akbar to the followers of the 'Divine Faith.' See Blochmann,\r\npp. 166 n. and 203; and Badayuni, ii, 338. Ahmad appears to be the\r\nAhmad Sufi of Blochmann, pp. 208, 209, and of Badayuni, ii, 404,\r\nand Lowe, p. 418. He was a member of the 'Divine Faith.'\r\n\r\n[126] Text, puj or puch, but the manuscript reading luk is\r\npreferable. Erskine's MS. has luj, naked.\r\n\r\n[127] Price (p. 83) has Anand or Anwand. Apparently Aluwa is right; it\r\nis a place 18 miles north-west of Umballa. Cf. \"India under Aurangzib,\"\r\nby J. N. Sarkar.\r\n\r\n[128] Abu-l-Bey, the Abu-l-Baqa of Akbar-nama, iii, 820.\r\n\r\n[129] A member of the 'Divine Faith' (Blochmann, p. 452, etc.).\r\n\r\n[130] The text has qatl by mistake for qabl.\r\n\r\n[131] Biryani. See Blochmann, p. 60.\r\n\r\n[132] The Gundval of Tiefenthaler, i, 113. Cunningham, in his history\r\nof the Sikhs, spells it Goindwal. It is on the Beas.\r\n\r\n[133]  The text has singhasan instead of sukhasan. Kamgaar Husaini\r\nhas sukhpal.\r\n\r\n[134] Instead of the basuzanad of the text, the MSS. have bashuranad,\r\nhe defiles. In the last line they have jay instead of takht.\r\n\r\n[135] I.e. the place to which to turn in prayer.\r\n\r\n[136] Elliot (vi, 299) has Jahan, and the word in the MSS. does not\r\nlook like Jaipal.\r\n\r\n[137] This word appears to be a mistake; it is not in the MSS.\r\n\r\n[138] When the boat stuck, the boatmen swam ashore, and it was probably\r\nthen that Husain shot at them. See Blochmann, p. 414, n. 2.\r\n\r\n[139] \"With a chain fastened from his left hand to his left foot,\r\naccording to the law of Chingiz Khan\" (Gladwin's Jahangir, quoted by\r\nElliot, vi, 507). But apparently what is meant is that Khusrau was\r\nled up from the left side of the emperor.\r\n\r\n[140] Du Jarric, in his history of the Jesuit Missions, gives some\r\ndetails about the punishment. The bullock and ass were slaughtered\r\non the spot and their skins were sewed on the bodies of the unhappy\r\nmen. Horns and ears were left on the skins.\r\n\r\n[141] Perhaps the meaning is that the weather was bad.\r\n\r\n[142] The proper form seems to be Bhaironwal, the Bhyrowal of the\r\nmaps. It is on the right bank of the Biah (Beas) on the road from\r\nJalandhar to Amritsar. See Blochmann, p. 414, note.\r\n\r\n[143] The words are omitted in the text. Erskine read in his MS. gau\r\njizwan, which I do not understand. The I.O. MSS. and B.M. MS. Or 3276\r\nhave gawan u kharan. Husain Beg, whose proper name was Hasan, was a\r\nbrave soldier, and did good service under Akbar. See his biography\r\nin Blochmann, p. 454.\r\n\r\n[144] The fifth Guru of the Sikhs and the compiler of the Granth. He\r\nwas the father of Har Govind. See Sayyid Muhammad Latif's history of\r\nthe Punjab, p. 253. Arjun's tomb is in Lahore.\r\n\r\n[145] But qashqa is a Turkish word. The Hindi phrase seems to be tika.\r\n\r\n[146] The cousin of Moses, famous for his wealth; the Korah of\r\nthe Bible.\r\n\r\n[147] Gladwin has Nagh.\r\n\r\n[148] Blochmann, p. 50.\r\n\r\n[149] Akbar-nama, iii, 748, and Blochmann, p. 546. He was a man\r\nof piety and learning, and Jahangir means that he restored him to\r\nhis former quiet life. The arbab-i-sa`adat, or auspicious persons,\r\nwere those who offered up prayers for the king's prosperity and\r\nother blessings.\r\n\r\n[150] Amba was killed later by Nur-Jahan's husband, Shir-Afgan (Tuzuk,\r\npp. 54, 55).\r\n\r\n[151] Blochmann, p. 310.\r\n\r\n[152] These words are not in the MSS., and they seem to have crept\r\ninto the text by mistake and to be a premature entry of words relating\r\nto Hashim, etc. The brother of the former ruler (or king) of Khandesh\r\ncould hardly be a khanazad.\r\n\r\n[153] This should be, according to the MSS., \"army against the Rana,\"\r\nnot army of the Deccan.\r\n\r\n[154] The MSS. have \"in the neighbourhood of Lahore.\" Parwiz had then\r\ncharge of Bihar.\r\n\r\n[155] Text, wrongly, Bahman. Jahangir was born on the 21st of\r\nShahriwar.\r\n\r\n[156] Apparently, had long looked forward to the happy day when\r\nJahangir should be weighed as a king.\r\n\r\n[157] Perhaps the meaning is that he was introduced along with\r\nDaniyal's children.\r\n\r\n[158] Blochmann, p. 492.\r\n\r\n[159] This refers to his parentage.\r\n\r\n[160] In the MSS. this name seems to be Bhim Mal. Manjholi is written\r\nManjholah in Blochmann, p. 175.\r\n\r\n[161] ? Nandanpur. These places are in Sindsagar, near Multan.\r\n\r\n[162] MS. 181 has Bahar, and it has 600 instead of 800 horse.\r\n\r\n[163] Text, Uymaq puri (?). MS. 181 has buri, and 305 seems to have\r\nthe same. Can it mean 'red cavalry'? As Blochmann has pointed out,\r\n371, n. 2, the word Uymaq does not always mean the tribe, but was\r\nused to denote a superior kind of cavalry.\r\n\r\n[164] The qamargah or ring-hunt produced 265 head of game; the rest\r\nwere shot at other times; the total of the list should be apparently\r\n576.\r\n\r\n[165] The MSS. have the 6th stage instead of \"last.\"\r\n\r\n[166] This is the famous Khan Jahan Lodi of Shah Jahan's reign.\r\n\r\n[167] Text, ba dastur.\r\n\r\n[168] I.e. built him up in it.\r\n\r\n[169] Jahangir did not like the Khankhanan, and so here belittles\r\nhis services.\r\n\r\n[170] During Shah Jahan's reign, Khan Jahan Lodi fled from Court,\r\nwas pursued, and killed.\r\n\r\n[171] Perhaps the antelope's name was Raj, and the syllable man the\r\npronoun 'my,' when the translation would be 'my antelope Raj.' See\r\nElliot, vi, 302, and R.A.S. MS., No. 124.\r\n\r\n[172] Perhaps the Jandiala of the Indian Gazetteer, vii, 137.\r\n\r\n[173] Indian Gazetteer, v, 239.\r\n\r\n[174] Text omits the negative.\r\n\r\n[175] Text, susani; apparently a blue iris.\r\n\r\n[176] The text has shumar wrongly for shiyar, and it seems that\r\nthe negative of the text is wrong, since it does not occur in the\r\nMSS. Abu-l-fazl gives the number of petals and stamens more correctly\r\nthan Jahangir.\r\n\r\n[177] Az tikka andazi; perhaps 'the cast of a javelin.'\r\n\r\n[178] Lit. 'have joined hands.'\r\n\r\n[179] Sih-barga; but this reading seems doubtful; perhaps it is\r\nsir-i-barga, full of leaves. Jahangir says that to lay a carpet on the\r\ngrass would be bi-dardi, unfeeling, unsympathetic, and kam saliqagi.\r\n\r\n[180] The text has naqsh bar jay, but the true reading seems to\r\nbe nafiztar.\r\n\r\n[181] `Ilm-i-khala`-i-badan, 'withdrawal of the soul from the body'\r\n(Erskine).\r\n\r\n[182] So in text, but the MSS. and Elliot, vi, 307, have \"on one of\r\nthe gates.\"\r\n\r\n[183] The figures seem wrong, and the MSS. differ. See Elliot, vi,\r\n307. Apparently the correct sum in rupees is 34 lakhs 25,000. At\r\np. 61 the khani of Turan is reckoned at one-third of a rupee. If\r\nthe dam be taken at its ordinary value of one-fortieth of a rupee,\r\nthe number of rupees should be 40 lakhs 25,000, and if the khani\r\nof Turan be one-third of a rupee we should read one kror instead of\r\none arb. Probably Jahangir has used arb as meaning kror, and not 100\r\nkrors. There is a valuable note on his expedition through the Ghakkar\r\ncountry in Blochmann, p. 486. Blochmann takes the figures for the\r\nrupees to be four krors, but probably this is due to wrong pointing.\r\n\r\n[184] The MSS. and text have Pila or Pila. I adopt Tila from Blochmann,\r\np. 487, note. Elliot has Tillah, vi, 307, and note.\r\n\r\n[185] In Tolbort's account of Ludhiyana, J.A.S.B. for 1869, p. 86,\r\nbhakhra is given as the name of a creeping plant (Pedalium murex).\r\n\r\n[186] Rud-khana; this, according to Blochmann, should be the river\r\nKahan, khana being a mistake for Kahan. See p. 487 note. But all the\r\nMSS. have khana.\r\n\r\n[187] See Elliot, vi, 309 note.\r\n\r\n[188] Bugyals; Elliot, vi, 309. They are descendants of Sultan Buga.\r\n\r\n[189] Paka is mentioned in Tiefenthaler, i, 114.\r\n\r\n[190] Khor; Elliot, vi, 309 note. Near the Manikyala tope.\r\n\r\n[191] Kharbuza Saray is marked on Elphinstone's map.\r\n\r\n[192] Mr. Rogers has \"The soul of the fool thou canst purchase for\r\nlittle.\" Perhaps the sense is \"God grants life to the fool on hard\r\nterms.\" Erskine has \"To serve a fool is hard indeed.\" Possibly the\r\nliteral meaning is \"You buy the soul of the fool at a high price,\"\r\nthat is, it costs a great deal to win him over. Elliot had what is\r\nprobably the best rendering, \"Barbarous characters should be treated\r\nwith severity\"; though in Elliot, vi, 310, the translation is,\r\n\"The life of fools is held very cheap in troublous times.\"\r\n\r\n[193] Apparently this remark must have been written after Jahangir's\r\nvisit to Kashmir by the Baramula route in the fourteenth year.\r\n\r\n[194] Bhanwar, as Mr. Lowe has pointed out, means in Hindi an eddy\r\nor whirlpool.\r\n\r\n[195] William Finch says that at Hasan Abdal there were many fish with\r\ngold rings in their noses hung by Akbar, and that the water is so clear\r\nthat you may see a penny in the bottom. Jahangir's informants were\r\napparently not versed in hagiography. Baba Hasan Abdal is apparently\r\nthe saint who was an ancestor of Ma`sum Bhakari, and is buried at\r\nQandahar. See Beale, and Jarrett's translation of the Ayin, ii, 324\r\nnote. The Sikhs identify the place with their Baba Nanak. It is not\r\na wife of Akbar who is buried at Hasan Abdal, but Hakim Abu-l-fath\r\nand his brother.\r\n\r\n[196] Elliot has Amardi, but the MSS. have Amrohi. The Ma'asir, ii,\r\n755, has Ahru'i. See Blochmann, p. 522.\r\n\r\n[197] Az taghyan farud amada. Perhaps the meaning is exactly the\r\nopposite, viz. 'had come down in violence.' But if so, could a bridge\r\nhave been made, and with eighteen boats? The time was the 4th or 5th\r\nMay. Elliot has \"the Nilab was very full.\"\r\n\r\n[198] According to the Ma'asiru-l-umara, iii, 376, Ma`mur is a village\r\nin Arabia.\r\n\r\n[199] The MSS. have sad instead of chand, i.e. 100.\r\n\r\n[200] This Asaf Khan is Qawamu-d-din Ja`far Beg and the No. iii of\r\nBlochmann, p. 411. Apparently his appointment as Mir Bakhshi was made\r\nin 989 (1581), in which year Akbar went to Kabul. Blochmann says Asaf\r\nKhan was made Mir Bakhshi in the room of Qazi `Ali, and we find at\r\np. 372 of A. N., iii, that Qazi `Ali Bakhshi was appointed in that\r\nyear to the Panjab. Twenty-eight years before 1016 (to the beginning\r\nof which Jahangir is referring) yields 988. Basawal is on right bank\r\nof Kabul River below Jalalabad.\r\n\r\n[201] Text bauli, but the MSS. have luli, i.e. dancing-girl.\r\n\r\n[202] Generally spelt ballut, either the oak or the\r\nchestnut. Cf. Erskine's Baber, p. 145. Sir Alexander Burnes calls\r\nthe ballut the holly.\r\n\r\n[203] See below, p. 52, where the Ra'is or headman of Chikri is\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n[204] Cf. Erskine's Baber, p. 145.\r\n\r\n[205] The fort of Pesh Bulaq is mentioned in the third volume of the\r\nAkbar-nama, p. 512. It is marked on the map of Afghanistan between\r\nDaka and Jalalabad.\r\n\r\n[206] Sic in text, but should be Jaunpur as in the MSS.\r\n\r\n[207] There was also a Shahr-banu who was Babar's sister. Bika Begam\r\nwas Babar's widow and the lady who carried his bones to Kabul.\r\n\r\n[208] Bakafsh-pay, which Erskine renders 'with slippers on' and Elliot\r\n'with his shoes on.'\r\n\r\n[209] Bayazid Biyat describes Humayun as holding a cooking festival\r\nin Badakhshan. See A.N., i, translation, p. 496, n. 2. They cooked\r\nbughra, which appears to be macaroni. The text wrongly has raqz az\r\n`ishq (love-dances). The real word, as the MSS. show, is arghushtaq,\r\nwhich is a kind of dance (not a child's game as in Johnson). It\r\nis described in Vullers, s.v., in accordance with the account in\r\nthe Burhan-i-qati`. It is a dance by girls or young men, and is\r\naccompanied with singing and with clapping of hands, etc. Probably\r\nit is the dance described by Elphinstone in his account of Kabul,\r\ni, 311, where he says: \"The great delight of all the western Afghans\r\nis to dance the Attun or Ghoomboor. From ten to twenty men or women\r\nstand up in a circle (in summer before their houses and tents,\r\nand in winter round a fire); a person stands within the circle to\r\nsing and play on some instrument. The dancers go through a number of\r\nattitudes and figures; shouting, clapping their hands, and snapping\r\ntheir fingers. Every now and then they join hands, and move slow or\r\nfast according to the music, all joining in chorus. When I was showed\r\nthis, a love-song was sung to an extremely pretty tune, very simple,\r\nand not unlike a Scottish air.\" Erskine's translation is: \"Custards\r\nand confections were presented, and the amusements of dancing girls\r\nand arghustak were introduced.\"\r\n\r\n[210] The words seem to me to yield 1066, but if we read pajshanba\r\ninstead of panjshanba we get 1016, which is the Hijra date of\r\nJahangir's entry into Kabul and corresponds to 4th June, 1607. A\r\nmarginal note on I.O.M. 305 makes the chronogram clear by writing\r\nruz-i-panchanba hizhdah-i-Safar, thereby getting rid of the mim and\r\nthe ya of hizhdaham and bringing out the figures 1016.\r\n\r\n[211] Evidently a kind of sheep.\r\n\r\n[212] This is a reference to Babar's Memoirs.\r\n\r\n[213] A juz' is said to consist of eight leaves or sixteen pages. Does\r\nJahangir mean that he wrote sixty-four pages?\r\n\r\n[214] Probably the sections which Jahangir wrote were those printed\r\nin the Ilminsky edition and which bring the narrative down to\r\nBabar's death. They seem to have been in great measure copied from\r\nthe Akbar-nama. Jahangir does not say if he wrote them when he was\r\nin Kabul or previously. According to Blochmann, J.A.S.B. for 1869,\r\np. 134, one juz' = two sheets of paper. The passage is translated in\r\nElliot, vi, 315. Though Jahangir does not say when he wrote the four\r\nsections, I think that his language implies that these additions were\r\nin the manuscript when he was looking at it in Kabul. Perhaps he made\r\nthem when he was a student in India, and for the sake of practice in\r\nTurki. He may have translated the sections from the Akbar-nama. All,\r\nI think, he did in Kabul was to put the Turki note, stating that the\r\nsections were his. But possibly even this was done before. Elliot,\r\nvi, 315, has the words \"to complete the work,\" but these words do not\r\noccur in the MSS. that I have seen. The translation in Elliot, seems to\r\nrepresent Jahangir's words as meaning that the work was complete, but\r\nthat the four sections were not, like the rest, in Babar's handwriting,\r\nand so Jahangir re-copied them. But it does not appear that there\r\ncould be any object in his doing this. There is a valuable article\r\nin the Zeitschrift d. Deutschen Morgenl. Gesellsch. for 1883, p. 141,\r\nby Dr. Teufel, entitled \"Bâbur und Abû'l-fazl,\" in which the fragments\r\nin Ilminsky are discussed. But the passage in the Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri\r\nis not referred to.\r\n\r\n[215] The text mentions a horse, but the MSS. have not this, and it\r\nseems to be a mistake.\r\n\r\n[216] Apparently the Shorkot of I.G., xii, 424. In the Rechnau Duab\r\n(Jarrett, ii, 321). It is north of Multan and in the Jhang district.\r\n\r\n[217] I.G., v, 188.\r\n\r\n[218] Perhaps the `Ali Dust Khan of Blochmann, p. 533.\r\n\r\n[219] The MSS. have Herat, and this is probably correct.\r\n\r\n[220] That is, apparently, Mirza Shadman, but perhaps the meaning\r\nis that Qaracha had sought a wife for his son among the Hazaras,\r\nand not that he had himself married an Hazara woman.\r\n\r\n[221] The MSS. have \"less than 1 1/2 gaz by 1/8 (nim-pao).\"\r\n\r\n[222] Should, I think, be Tattah, i.e. Sind.\r\n\r\n[223] Ghaibana, 'secretly.' But the phrase merely means that the\r\nappointment was not made in the Emperor's presence.\r\n\r\n[224] Text bargasht, 'he turned round.' But the MSS. have chi\r\nrawish-i-tuzukast, \"What kind of arrangement is this?\"\r\n\r\n[225] Shamshir-i-sikhaki, 'pointed sword, poniard'?\r\n\r\n[226] The meaning of two words being used probably is that both\r\nHindu and Persian astrologers are referred to. Blochmann, p. 311,\r\nsays that Shah-Jahan's birthday was 30th Rabi`u-l-awwal.\r\n\r\n[227] Lit., \"His disposition had changed from equability.\"\r\n\r\n[228] Gilas is a cherry in Kashmiri. See Blochmann's Ayin,\r\np. 616. Abu-l-fazl mentions in the Ayin (Blochmann, p. 66) that Akbar\r\ncalled gilas shah-alu.\r\n\r\n[229] Paywandi means 'to graft,' and possibly this is the meaning here,\r\nbut Steingass gives paywandi as part of the name of a plum. The text\r\nseems to be corrupt, and perhaps what Jahangir wrote was \"the zard-alu\r\nresembles the khubani.\"\r\n\r\n[230] Text has Yaqut, but it is clear from the Iqbal-nama, p. 25,\r\nand from I.O. MS. 181 that the name is Khwaja Tabut, 'the coffin\r\nKhwaja.' The author of the Iqbal-nama was the person sent to make the\r\ninquiry, and he gives a long account of what he saw. A surgeon was\r\nsent with him, as the Khwaja was said to have been martyred, and it\r\nwas necessary to report on the wounds. The coffin story is mentioned\r\nin the Ayin, i, 194. See Jarrett, ii, 409-10, but the translation is\r\nnot quite accurate, I think. The punctuation of the text seems to me\r\nto be correct. It is characteristic of Jahangir and the author of\r\nthe Iqbal-nama that they take no notice of the colossal figures at\r\nBamiyan, though Abu-l-fazl does. See Jarrett's note. It is stated in\r\nthe Iqbal-nama that Khwaja Tabut was said to have been killed in the\r\ntime of Chingiz Khan. If so, the Sultan Mahmud mentioned by Jahangir\r\nmust be Sultan Mahmud Ghori.\r\n\r\n[231] He was appointed governor of Sehwan (Iqbal-nama, p. 27).\r\n\r\n[232] The MSS merely have \"of a size that I had never seen\r\nbefore.\" Probably the text is corrupt, and the meaning may be \"as\r\nbig as a head.\" Bih is a quince, and perhaps this is what is meant\r\nhere. Or the meaning may be \"equal to the biggest for size.\" Or sar\r\nmay be a mistake for sih and the meaning be \"equal in size to three\r\n(ordinary peaches).\"\r\n\r\n[233] I.O. MS. 181 has Qarqara mountains. There is also the reading\r\nKharaq.\r\n\r\n[234] Blochmann, p. 31.\r\n\r\n[235] Du'aba is mentioned as a stage by W. Finch.\r\n\r\n[236] The text omits the word zinda, 'alive.'\r\n\r\n[237] The urdu or camp was probably not with Jahangir then, and he\r\nthought that if he sent to it for the capture of 500 there would be\r\nconfusion. He therefore contented himself at the time with arresting\r\nthe ringleaders. There is a full account of the conspiracy in the\r\nIqbal-nama, p. 27, etc.\r\n\r\n[238] Possibly the meaning is \"his experience was greater than\r\nhis skill.\"\r\n\r\n[239] Lit., when he was smooth-faced, i.e. beardless.\r\n\r\n[240] The I.O. MSS. do not call him governor, and the names of the\r\nanimals captured differ in the MSS. from those given in the text. The\r\nlatter are obviously wrong, and I have discarded them. The Iqbal-nama,\r\np. 30, has Arzana as the name of the hunting-ground. Erskine has\r\nArzina.\r\n\r\n[241] Erskine has \"many of the hounds were destroyed.\" Sagan-i-tazi\r\nprobably means greyhounds, whether bred in Arabia or elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[242] Blochmann, p. 377, and Ma'asiru-l-umara, ii, 642. He was\r\nan Arghun.\r\n\r\n[243] The passage is obscure and the text is corrupt. Erskine's\r\ntranslation is: \"His manners towards the soldiers is frank and gallant,\r\nbut not according to the rules of discipline, especially towards those\r\nwho have been or are in the wars with him. He is much flattered by his\r\nservants, which gives him a light appearance.\" Evidently Erskine read\r\nudzi or naz instead of baz as in the text, and the MSS. support his\r\nreading. I think, however, that naz kashidan means 'to jest.' Instead\r\nof the ta bamandand of text the MSS. have ya namayand, the meaning\r\nbeing those soldiers who have served him well, or are doing so. We\r\nlearn from Blochmann, p. 378, that Shah Beg was \"a frank Turk.\"\r\n\r\n[244] The peculiarity of this year was that the lunar month and\r\nthe solar month of Akbar's birth, viz. Rajab and Aban, coincided,\r\nso that there was a double celebration.\r\n\r\n[245] Wajihu-d-din was a famous Gujarat saint. He died in 998.\r\n\r\n[246] The word used by Jahangir, and which has been translated 'repeat\r\ncontinually,' is mudawamat, and Erskine understood it to mean that\r\nJahangir hoped to prolong his life by this exercise.\r\n\r\n[247] Har ahu'i kih zad bar sar-i-tir raft. The literal rendering\r\napparently is: \"whenever an antelope was struck by him the arrow\r\nentered up to its (the arrow's) head.\" Perhaps the meaning simply is\r\nevery arrow (or bullet) that he shot went home.\r\n\r\n[248] Jalal Khan was a grandson of Sultan Adam (Blochmann, pp. 455\r\nand 486).\r\n\r\n[249] See infra for another notice of him in the chapter on Gujrat.\r\n\r\n[250] One of Jahangir's wives was a daughter of Ray Ray Singh (of\r\nBikanir). See Blochmann, p. 310.\r\n\r\n[251] See Rieu, Cat. ii, p. 634.\r\n\r\n[252] There is evidently something wrong in the text, for a ruby\r\nweighing 6 surkhs could not weigh 2 tanks and 15 surkhs. I.O. MS. 181\r\nhas barja instead of surkh, but I do not know what this means. Perhaps\r\nshash-gusha, 'hexagonal,' was intended. This view is confirmed by\r\nthe Iqbal-nama, p. 31, which has shash pahlu, 'six-sided.' Erskine's\r\nMS. also had 'six-sided,' and he translates \"a six-sided ruby which\r\nweighed two tangs fifteen surkhs.\" I.O. MS. 305 has shash parcha,\r\nand it is evident that this word, as also the barja of No. 181,\r\nis the parche of Steingass, which means a segment or facet.\r\n\r\n[253] This remark about Mirza Ghazi, and also the quotation, do not\r\noccur in the two I.O. MSS.\r\n\r\n[254] Blochmann, p. 417.\r\n\r\n[255] Bayakta, but the I.O. MSS have batagpay, 'rapidly.'\r\n\r\n[256] Properly Zainu-d-din Mahmud. See the story in Badayuni, Ranking,\r\np. 589; also Akbar-nama translation, i, 611, and Blochmann, p. 539\r\nand note.\r\n\r\n[257] I do not know if this is the author. There appears to be no\r\nmention of the construction in the Akbar-nama. Nakodar is in the\r\nJalandhar district (I.G., x, 180, and Jarrett, ii. 317). Perhaps\r\nthe two tombs at Nakodar mentioned in I.G. as of Jahangir's time are\r\nthose of Muqim the Waziru-l-mulk and his wife. See Tuzuk, pp. 6 and 64.\r\n\r\n[258] Khwurd, lit. 'devoured.' Apparently he refers to the fact of\r\nthe birth as a misfortune. I.O. MS. 181 has sar-i-madar u pidar ra\r\nkhwurd, and the A.S. 124 has shir-i-madar u pidar-i-khud, 'the milk\r\nof his own mother and father'!\r\n\r\n[259] This is given as a quotation in No. 181.\r\n\r\n[260] This should be the 17th if Monday was the 14th.\r\n\r\n[261] The MSS. seem to have mutassil-i-mab-i-chaukandi, 'in shape\r\nlike a chaukandi(?).' It was from the roof of this building that\r\nHumayun fell.\r\n\r\n[262] Turghai or turghei is a thrush according to Vambéry, and was\r\nthe name of Timur's father. Perhaps the bird was the large maina,\r\nthe Bhimraj or Bhringraj(?) of the Ayin, Jarrett, ii, p. 125 and\r\nnote. In Scully's Glossary, turghai is said to be the lark. The text\r\narranges the words differently from the MSS. They have mushakhkhas\r\nMiyan Tuti gufta, and Erskine translates 'which said clearly Miyan\r\nTuti.' But possibly Jahangir meant that it spoke clearly like a parrot.\r\n\r\n[263] Blochmann, p. 332. Sikandra, Akbar's tomb, lies half-way between\r\nRankattah and Agra. Tiefenthaler, i, 206, gives the name as Runcta,\r\nand says it is a famous place, as Ram there took the figure of Paras\r\nRam. Jarrett, ii, 180, has Rangtah, and it is there described as a\r\nvillage on the Jumna, near the city, and a much frequented place of\r\nworship. The Agra volume of the N.W.P. Gazetteer, p. 764, spells\r\nit Runkutta, and says it is 9 miles north-west of Agra. See also\r\nMa'asir, ii, 407, art. Sa`id Khan, where mention is made of Rankatta\r\nand Hilalabad, and Blochmann, p. 332.\r\n\r\n[264] If Thursday was the 2nd, Saturday would be the 4th. He went\r\nfirst to Agra from Rangta, apparently.\r\n\r\n[265] Tuyghun or tuyghun is given in Zenker as Turki for the white\r\nfalcon. See Elliot, vi, 317.\r\n\r\n[266] Bighu, which is given in Zenker, is Turki. The text has lifu. The\r\nI.O. MSS. have bigu.\r\n\r\n[267] Should be budana, 'quail.'\r\n\r\n[268] Apparently this is a translation from the Hindi.\r\n\r\n[269] Text wrongly has 1014.\r\n\r\n[270] Jahangir calls Islam farzand because he was the son of his\r\nfoster-brother. Jahangir Quli means 'slave of Jahangir.'\r\n\r\n[271] The seed of Abrus precatorius.\r\n\r\n[272] Or devtaq. Qu. devanayak? The MSS. have yunk and wabunk. The\r\ntext is corrupt and has converted the word for 'bat' into a 'lamb.'\r\n\r\n[273] The text is corrupt.\r\n\r\n[274] Blochmann, p. 387.\r\n\r\n[275] Sister of Mirza Hakim, also known as Fakhru-n-nisa (Blochmann,\r\np. 322). The MSS. have Bakhtu-n-nisa, and it would seem that the\r\nNajibu-n-nisa of the text is a wrong reading. See Gulbadan Begam's\r\nMemoirs, p. 214.\r\n\r\n[276] Text wrongly has Shamshiri. The MSS. have Shustari, and this\r\nis right. See Blochmann, pp. 208, 209, and 518.\r\n\r\n[277] Riqa` is a kind of writing (Blochmann, pp. 99, 100).\r\n\r\n[278] Blochmann, p. 417. His name was Anisu-d-din.\r\n\r\n[279] This must be Raja Sangram of Kharakpur, who had been a rebel. See\r\nBlochmann, p. 446 and note.\r\n\r\n[280] Text Qutbi, but I think the word is Qibti, 'Egyptian.'\r\n\r\n[281] Fighani was a famous poet and also a drunkard. See Rieu,\r\nii, p. 651, and Sprenger, Oude Cat., p. 403. Fighani also means\r\nlamentation, and there is a play in the couplet on the double meaning.\r\n\r\n[282] In the Elliot MSS., B.M., the second line is translated\r\n\"Alas! if the angels made his shroud of another kind of odour!\" The\r\nangels meant are Nakir and Munkar.\r\n\r\n[283] Blochmann, p. 612.\r\n\r\n[284] Cf. Jarrett, ii, p. 122.\r\n\r\n[285] Blochmann, p. 469.\r\n\r\n[286] \"What money and articles he could produce at the time\" (Elliot,\r\nvi, 320).\r\n\r\n[287] Apparently the person spoken of as a Nazarene (Christian) was\r\nthe Emperor of Constantinople. Can this picture be the original of\r\nthat prefixed to White & Davey's translation of Timur's Institutes?\r\n\r\n[288] Perhaps the meaning is enough milk to fill a coffee-cup.\r\n\r\n[289] According to the contemporary, but anonymous, author quoted in\r\nElliot, vi, 448, this was in reward for restoring the sight of Khusrau.\r\n\r\n[290] Majzub-i-madar-zad. Probably the meaning is that he was a\r\nborn idiot.\r\n\r\n[291] The story is also told in the Iqbal-nama, p. 37, where it is\r\nsaid that the tiger was one brought by a calendar as a present. It\r\nhad the name of La`l Khan and was very tame. It is added that the\r\ntiger did no injury to the jogi with his claws or teeth.\r\n\r\n[292] The MSS. have `Inayat.\r\n\r\n[293] I.O. MS. No. 181, Shah Beg Khan.\r\n\r\n[294] Salamu-llah is mentioned later on (p. 78), and is described\r\nas brother's son of Mubarak, who held the country of Jotra (?) and\r\nDarful. He is also mentioned in the Iqbal-nama, p. 38, where Mubarak\r\nis described as ruler (hakim) of Juyza and Saful (?). But a MS. of the\r\nIqbal-nama in my possession only mentions Juyza or Juyna. I think Juyza\r\nmust be Juina or Juanny, which, according to Sir William Jones, is one\r\nof the names of the island of Johanna or Hinzuan (one of the Comorro\r\nIslands), and that Saful must be Sofala, a town on the east coast of\r\nAfrica. Sir W. Jones was landed on Johanna, and has a long account\r\nof the island (see his works). The Iqbal-nama says that Salamu-llah\r\nkilled himself with drink. There is a short notice of him in the\r\nMa'asir, ii, 641, where he is called by his title of Shaja`at Khan.\r\n\r\n[295] The I.O. MSS. have a different reading here. Instead of 'every\r\nmorning' they have 'renew (humility).' The word nur, 'light,' in the\r\nlast line probably refers to Jahangir's name of Nuru-d-din.\r\n\r\n[296] See note above. Jutra or Jotra is probably a mistake for the\r\nisland of Johanna, i.e. Hinzuan. Darful is Dazful in I.O. MS. No. 181.\r\n\r\n[297] Possibly Qur Yasawul is right, but most probably it was a\r\nyasawul attached to the Qur, for which see Blochmann, p. 50.\r\n\r\n[298] Jahangir's conduct was sufficiently brutal, but the text has\r\nmade it worse than it was by omitting the word pay before pay. The\r\nback tendons of the bearers' feet were cut. Their feet were not cut\r\noff. Erskine translates the passage rightly, and the I.O. MSS. agree\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n[299] This was the same `Abdu-r-Rahim who was a companion of Khusrau,\r\nand after his capture was sweated in a skin. As he had life left in\r\nhim he escaped from that destruction, and, on being released, became\r\none of the personal servants, and served His Majesty till by degrees\r\nthe latter became gracious to him. (Note of Sayyid Ahmad.)\r\n\r\n[300] Ghazi Khan was one of the famous officers of Akbar. Husam his\r\nson was married to Abu-l-fazl's sister. See Blochmann, p. 440.\r\n\r\n[301] Brahmini ducks.\r\n\r\n[302] A son of Akbar's officer, Muhammad Quli Barlas (Blochmann,\r\npp. 342 and 478).\r\n\r\n[303] Mir `Ali was a famous calligrapher. See Rieu, Cat., ii, 531. Can\r\nthe copy mentioned by Jahangir be that in the Bodleian Library, which\r\nSir W. Jones praised so highly? A writer in the Journal of the Moslem\r\nInstitute for January-March, 1907, p. 186, suggests that the copy is\r\nin the Bankipur Library.\r\n\r\n[304] The Iqbal-nama, p. 41, has Shayyadi, 'a dervish, a hypocrite,'\r\nand the R.A.S. MS. has Sayyidi Shayyad. Shayyad is used at p. 60 to\r\nmean an impostor. Here, perhaps, it would mean a buffoon.\r\n\r\n[305] `Ali Ahmad's father was Shaikh Husain. See Blochmann, p. 53.\r\n\r\n[306] It was the bathing of the Hindus that the saint was watching.\r\n\r\n[307] The point of Amir Khusrau's hemistich is that kaj-kulah literally\r\nmeans 'the awry cap,' and so refers to the saint, who had his cap\r\non his ear or on the side of his head. But it also means one who is\r\npresumptuous, and has left the true path of religion. It also means,\r\naccording to Steingass, a beloved person.\r\n\r\n[308] I.O. MS. 181 has Takht-i-bakht (Throne of fortune).\r\n\r\n[309] Kesho Das was perhaps the father of Karamsi, one of Akbar's\r\nwives. See Blochmann, p. 310.\r\n\r\n[310] Blochmann, p. 465.\r\n\r\n[311] Takhti, qu. a signet?\r\n\r\n[312] Kaukab is mentioned again at the end of the twelfth year. For\r\nnotice of his father see Blochmann, p. 485.\r\n\r\n[313] Elliot, vi, 321.\r\n\r\n[314] Ujjainiyya here means Bhojpur.\r\n\r\n[315] Apparently we may infer from this that Jahangir did blind\r\nor attempt to blind his son Khusrau, though he says nothing about\r\nit. Else why should this impostor pretend that he had marks of\r\nthe blinding? Tavernier says Khusrau was blinded. Du Jarric also\r\ntells us that Jahangir blinded Khusrau on his way back from Kabul,\r\nwhen he came to the place where Khusrau had fought the battle. He was\r\nblinded by some juice of a plant being poured into his eyes. The juice\r\nresembled milk (qu. Euphorbia). One of his captains, who was also a\r\njudge, was likewise blinded there along with his son. W. Finch, too,\r\nspeaks of this outbreak. He also says that Khusrau was reported to\r\nhave been blinded on the battlefield with a glass. Another story was\r\nthat Jahangir merely caused a handkerchief to be tied over his eyes\r\nand had it sealed with his own seal. It is mentioned in Whiteway's\r\n\"Rise of the Portuguese Power in India,\" p. 165, note, that fifteen\r\nrelatives of the King of Ormuz had been blinded by red-hot bowls\r\nhaving been passed close to their eyes.\r\n\r\n[316] Kharakpur. The word is written Gorakhpur in some MSS., but I\r\nthink it is clear that Kharakpur is the place meant, for `Abdu-r-Rahman\r\nhad lately got Sangram's estate of Kharakpur in jagir. The fact, too,\r\nthat he fought with the impostor at the Pun Pun to the east of Patna\r\nshows that he was coming back from down the Ganges.\r\n\r\n[317] Text wrongly has Mandhu.\r\n\r\n[318] A tasu, or tasu, is said in Wilson's Glossary to be the 24th\r\npart of a gaz or about a third of an inch. I.O. MS. makes the breadth\r\n3 1/2 cubits 1 tasu. The slab is described in Keene's Guide and in\r\nthe N.W.P. Gazetteer, Agra volume. One inscription has the date 1011,\r\nor 1602. Archæological Report, lv, pp. 132-5, says it is 10 ft. 7 1/2\r\nins. long, 9 ft. 10 ins. broad, and 6 inches thick. It is supported\r\non octagonal pedestals. See also Beale's Miftahu-t-tawarikh, pp. 300,\r\n301, where a representation of the stone and copies of the inscriptions\r\nare given.\r\n\r\n[319] A fort in the Deccan \"sixty miles north of Bidar\" (Elliot,\r\nvi, 70).\r\n\r\n[320] So in MSS. Apparently Khan Jahan's meaning was that if this\r\nDeccani man were sent to Agra (as if to be punished) the other Deccani\r\nleaders would be discouraged.\r\n\r\n[321] The text seems corrupt. Apparently I.O. MS. has Sargala, and\r\nthis may have been Kesho Das's title.\r\n\r\n[322] Para durtar, but it would seem from the Ma'asir, ii, 231,\r\nfive lines from foot, that para, or bara, is a word meaning a body\r\nof men. Perhaps it is barah, 'twelve.'\r\n\r\n[323] At p. 256 we have the phrase majra girand applied to the\r\ndirecting of cannon against the buildings of Fort Ranthambhor. I\r\nconfess that I do not know whether Jahangir fired the gun that was\r\non the stand or the one that Kamal loaded.\r\n\r\n[324] Majra giriftam seems rather to mean here 'adjusted the tripod,'\r\nfor from what follows it appears that the gun was not then loaded. The\r\nIqbal-nama, p. 47, has masha ra zir kard, 'applied the match'(?).\r\n\r\n[325] Apparently the meaning is that he rolled the tiger over to the\r\nside furthest from Jahangir.\r\n\r\n[326] Kuragi. The Iqbal-nama, p. 48, says the night was dark, and\r\nso the lamplighter blindly (az kuragi) fell upon the tiger and was\r\nkilled. This tiger hunt and Jahangir's danger, etc., are described\r\nby William Finch (Purchas, i, 430).\r\n\r\n[327] Anikini means an army in Sanskrit and Rai is a title meaning\r\nleadership.\r\n\r\n[328] Text, Zangchiyan (?). I.O. 181 has Ibachkiyan, i.e. people of the\r\nIbachki-khana or closet. See Ayin, Persian text, i, 42, and Blochmann,\r\ni, 46.\r\n\r\n[329] This is said ironically.\r\n\r\n[330] The text has 14th night, but I follow the I.O. MS. 181.\r\n\r\n[331] Jahangir does not mention that it was in this year that he\r\nmarried Nur-Jahan. He saw her on New Year's Day (Iqbal-nama, p. 56),\r\nand it appears from a note of Jahangir on p. 132 of B.M. MS. Or. 3276\r\nthat he married her on 14th Khurdad (end of May, 1611). It was in the\r\n11th year that she got the title of Nur-Jahan. Before that she was\r\nknown as Nur-Mahall. It would seem that Jahangir married Nur-Jahan\r\nfour years and a few days after her first husband's death.\r\n\r\n[332] Khan Dauran was away in the district of Ningnahar (Iqbal-nama,\r\np. 53).\r\n\r\n[333] Text wrongly has Qizilbashes.\r\n\r\n[334] Or Barki.\r\n\r\n[335] The text has here the word ghayatan, which does not seem to\r\nhave much meaning. Erskine has 'without his knowledge,' so he probably\r\nhad gha'ibana in his MS.\r\n\r\n[336] Compare Elliot, vi, 324.\r\n\r\n[337] Sang-i-durushti. Elliot had the name reading and translates 'a\r\nheavy stone.' But both MSS. have sang u rasani, 'a stone and a cord,'\r\nquery a sling, and this is certainly the right reading. See Iqbal-nama,\r\np. 57.\r\n\r\n[338] Text bar pay, but the I.O. MS. and Iqbal-nama, p. 58, have bar\r\nbazi ('on the rope'? or perhaps 'is doing gymnastics')\r\n\r\n[339] Note of Sayyid Ahmad (to the fourth compartment).--\"Evidently\r\nthis masterpiece was not the work of a slave in the seal department,\r\nfor no reason appears why the portrait of Jesus should be introduced\r\ninto the fourth compartment. Probably this masterpiece was the work\r\nof Frank artists and had fallen into the hands of the slave, and he\r\nhad ascribed it to his own workmanship. (Perhaps the scene depicted\r\nwas the Transfiguration.)\"\r\n\r\n[340] See Blochmann, p. 89, note. It came from Europe.\r\n\r\n[341] In Scinde; it is the same as Sahwan, and is on the Indus.\r\n\r\n[342] Blochmann, p. 45.\r\n\r\n[343] Elliot, vi, 325.\r\n\r\n[344] Both MSS. have bar ru instead of bar u, 'in front' or 'in the\r\nface' of the letter, and this is no doubt the correct reading. See\r\nIqbal-nama, p. 59. See Blochmann, p. 263, for the different places\r\nwhere seals are to be put. Jahangir's order apparently was that the\r\nprovincial governors were not to impress their seals on the face of\r\ntheir letters or other documents.\r\n\r\n[345] The reference seems to be, not to these subsidiary regulations,\r\nbut to the code of twelve rules promulgated by him at the commencement\r\nof his reign.\r\n\r\n[346] Quruqchi in I.O. MS. and in Iqbal-nama, p. 60. Steingass gives\r\nit as meaning one who looks after the king's game, and as a sentinel.\r\n\r\n[347] Text has pustha, skins, but I.O.

The Sarkar\r\nof Orissa was included in Bengal, and its revenue is included in\r\nthis. (Note of Sayyid Ahmad.)\r\n\r\n[350] Also called Shaikh Kabir Chishti (Blochmann, p. 519;\r\nMa'asiru-l-umara, ii, 630).\r\n\r\n[351] Perhaps this is only rhetoric, but Abu-l-fazl describes how\r\nlots were cast between him and Raja Birbal as to who should go on\r\nthe Yusufzai expedition.\r\n\r\n[352] Ichi means a hawk, but the meaning may be a Shaikh of Uch. Acha\r\nis given in Zenker as meaning a father in Turki. The Iqbal-nama\r\nhas Ajha.\r\n\r\n[353] Text wrongly has A`zam. See Blochmann, p. 521, note.\r\n\r\n[354] Kishwar was the son of Jahangir's foster-brother Qutbu-d-din,\r\nwho was killed by Shir-afgan.\r\n\r\n[355] The Iqbal-nama and the B.M. MSS. call it Bakhla.\r\n\r\n[356] These last words seem to be part of Shaja`at's speech, but see\r\nIqbal-nama, p. 63. See also Elliot, vi, 329, and the translation of\r\nthe Iqbal-nama account in Appendix L, Stewart's Cat. of Tippo Sultan's\r\nMSS., p. 275. The Iqbal-nama says that `Usman's corpulence compelled\r\nhim to ride on an elephant.\r\n\r\n[357] The text has dar adhar u tarf kih dar tasarruf-i-an tira-ruzgar\r\nbud. I do not know if adhar is the name of a place or what its\r\nmeaning is. The I.O. MSS., Nos. 181 and 305, have arhad. Blochmann,\r\np. 520, on the authority of the Makhzan-i-Afghani, says the fight\r\ntook place 100 kos from Dacca and in a place called Nek Ujyal,\r\nand he points out in a note that there are several Ujyals in Eastern\r\nBengal. Possibly Adhar is Udhar or Uzar, and a corruption of Ujyal. The\r\n'hills of Dacca,' referred to by Blochmann, might be Ran Bhawal or\r\nthe Madhupur jungle. The Riyazu-s-salatin does not mention the site\r\nof the battle, and the translator, Maulawi `Abdu-s-Salam, has in his\r\nnote at p. 175 confounded two `Isa Khans, and so drawn groundless\r\ninferences. Blochmann points out, p. 520, that the Ma'asiru-l-umara\r\nsays the prisoners were afterwards put to death. The passage is at\r\nvol. ii, p. 632. It says they were put to death by Jahangir's orders by\r\n`Abdu-llah (who certainly was brute enough for anything). Jahangir,\r\nTuzuk, p. 112, mentions the arrival of `Usman's sons and brothers\r\nat Court, so that Blochmann's statement at p. 520 about their being\r\nexecuted on the road is not correct. It appears, too, they came to\r\nCourt after Shaja`at's death. Jahangir says (Tuzuk, p. 112) he made\r\nover the prisoners to responsible servants of government. `Abdu-llah\r\nmay have been one of these, and have got rid of his prisoners by\r\nkilling them. It would appear that the battle with `Usman took place\r\nto the east or south-east of Dacca, and not near Orissa, as Stewart\r\nsupposed.\r\n\r\n[358] The lines occur in Hafiz' divan, under the letter M,\r\nBrockhaus' ed., No. 396, but Jahangir has missed out two lines in his\r\nquotation. An Indian lithograph has rakht in the first line instead\r\nof sabr, but the latter reading occurs in Brockhaus. In the fourth\r\nline nargis is a mistake for tirkash. Tir-i-falak, 'the arrow of\r\nthe spheres,' is also a name for the planet Mercury. Tirkash-i-Jauza\r\nmeans both a particular constellation in the sign Gemini, which is\r\nsupposed to resemble a quiver in appearance, and also the strings\r\nof a musical instrument. The meaning of the lines seems to be,\r\n\"I have been wounded by the shaft of heaven: give me wine that I may\r\nbecome intoxicated and be able to tie a knot in the quiver-girdle of\r\nthe Gemini.\" The appositeness of the fal is not very apparent, but\r\nthe mention of an arrow was taken to be an allusion to the death of\r\n`Usman by a shot from an unknown hand.\r\n\r\n[359] Elliot, vi, 331.\r\n\r\n[360] They call this in the English language a turkey, and the people\r\nof India call it piru; Persian-knowing Indians call it in Persian\r\nfilmurgh. They are now plentiful in India. (Note of Sayyid Ahmad.)\r\n\r\n[361] Akbar-nama, iii, 533. It was in the 33rd year.\r\n\r\n[362] He asked Todar Mal's protection, but the son was sent\r\n(Akbar-nama, iii, 533).\r\n\r\n[363] This name is not in all the MSS. It is another name for I`tiqad,\r\nson of I`timadu-d-daulah.\r\n\r\n[364] Blochmann, p. 508.\r\n\r\n[365] Elliot, vi, 333.\r\n\r\n[366] Raja of Baglana.\r\n\r\n[367] A periphrasis for Jahangir himself.\r\n\r\n[368] The history of Nur, i.e. the history of Nuru-d-din Jahangir.\r\n\r\n[369] Should be Abu-n-nabi. See infra.\r\n\r\n[370] This was Arjumand Banu or Mumtaz-mahall, the favourite wife of\r\nShah Jahan and the mother of fourteen of his children. She was the\r\nniece of Nur-Jahan, her father being Nur-Jahan's brother, the Asaf\r\nKhan IV and Abu-l-hasan of Beale, who also had the names of I`tiqad\r\nKhan and Yaminu-d-daulah. There is an account of the betrothal and\r\nwedding in the Padshah-nama, i, 388. It seems that the betrothal took\r\nplace five years and three months before the marriage, and when Shah\r\nJahan was 15 years old. At the time of the marriage Shah Jahan was 20\r\nyears and 3 months old and Arjumand Banu was 19 years and 1 month. 18th\r\nKhurdad, 1021, would correspond to about the end of May, 1612, but\r\nthe Padshah-nama gives the eve of Friday, 9th Rabi`u-l-awwal of 1021,\r\ncorresponding to 22nd Urdibihisht, as the day of the marriage. This\r\nwould correspond to 30th April, 1612, so that apparently Jahangir's\r\nvisit to the house (apparently I`timadu-d-daulah's, but possibly Shah\r\nJahan's) took place about a month after the marriage. Arjumand Banu\r\ndied in childbed at Burhanpur in 1040, or July, 1631, the chronogram\r\nbeing one word, viz. gham, 'grief.' She must have been born in 1591,\r\nand was in her 40th year when she died. She was not Shah Jahan's first\r\nwife, for he was married to the daughter of Muzaffar Husain Safawi,\r\na descendant of Shah Isma`il of Persia, in September, 1610 (Rajab,\r\n1019), but the betrothal to Arjumand was earlier than this. It was\r\nin Arjumand's honour that the Taj was built.\r\n\r\n[371] Turha. The corresponding passage in the Iqbal-nama, p. 67, last\r\nline, shows that jewels are meant. The text omits the preposition ba\r\nbefore Begaman.\r\n\r\n[372] Khun-para, 'congestion of blood'; para or bara is used to mean\r\na collection or gathering. See Ma'asiru-l-umara, ii, 221, where we\r\nhave bara ya`ni jam`i. Erskine, in spite of his MS., reads chun para\r\nand translates 'as quicksilver.'\r\n\r\n[373] Asar, which, according to Forbes, is a sir weight.\r\n\r\n[374] Perhaps it was only what is called a char-jama and not an\r\nenclosed howdah.\r\n\r\n[375] The reference is to the Messiah as the restorer to life by\r\nHis breath. For baguzar, 'pass by,' Erskine had in his MS. maguzar,\r\n'pass not.' Apparently the verse means that it is more meritorious\r\nfor the Messiah to restore one man to life than it is for another to\r\nslay a hundred infidels.\r\n\r\n[376] `Ali Ahmad died suddenly two years before this, unless indeed the\r\npassage at p. 169 refers to the mimic and not to `Ali Ahmad. Probably\r\nthe meaning is that `Ali Ahmad had made this couplet on some previous\r\noccasion, and that one of the courtiers now quoted it. His verse about\r\nthe hundred murders may contain a play on the word khun, 'blood,'\r\nand refer to the spilling of the blood-like wine. It is difficult to\r\nunderstand how Jahangir came to introduce the verse into his Memoirs\r\nhere. It does not seem to have any connection with the account of\r\nthe Raja of Kumaon. Jahangir says it was quoted 'incidentally,' ba\r\ntaqarrubi. Perhaps the word here means 'by way of parody,' or 'by\r\nway of paraphrase.' In the MS. used by Erskine the words of the first\r\nline seem to be Maguzar Masih bar sar-i-ma, and so Erskine translates\r\n\"Pass not, O Messiah, over the heads of us victims of love.\" Perhaps\r\nmaguzar means 'do not pass by.'\r\n\r\n[377] This is the Dakhani chief mentioned previously at p. 192.\r\n\r\n[378] Blochmann, p. 485. He acted in Kashmir for his brother Hashim.\r\n\r\n[379] The katara was a long, narrow dagger. See Blochmann's Ayin,\r\npl. xli, fig. 9. But the word phul (flower) is obscure. Perhaps\r\nit means the knot or crochet of jewels called by Chardin, iv, 164,\r\ned. Rouen, \"une enseigne ronde de pierreries,\" and which, he says,\r\nthe Persians called 'rose de Poignard.'\r\n\r\n[380] He must have remained more than four days, for he got the news\r\nof Salima's death while in the garden. See infra. Perhaps the date\r\n10th refers to Day and not to Zi-l-qa`da. The Dahrah garden was in\r\nthe environs of Agra.\r\n\r\n[381] This statement is wrong. Salima was 76 when she died, she\r\nhaving been born on 4th Shawwal, 945, or 23rd February, 1539. She\r\ndied on or about 10th Zi-l-qa`da, 1021 (2nd January, 1613), so that\r\nshe was 73 solar years old. See note in B.M. MS. Or. 171, Rieu, 257a,\r\nand an article in J.A.S.B. for 1906. The note is by the author of\r\nthe Tarikh-i-Muhammadi and is at 72a of the B.M. MS. Or. 171, and\r\nthe corresponding passage appears in MS. Or. 182, on p. 140. The\r\nchronogram of Salima's birth was Khush-hal, which yields 945. She\r\nwas about 3 1/2 years older than Akbar.\r\n\r\n[382] The real name appears to be Abu-n-nabi. He had the title of\r\nBahadur Khan. See Ma'asiru-l-umara, i, 400. In the Akbar-nama, iii,\r\n820 and 839, he is called Abu-l-Baqa.\r\n\r\n[383] This must refer to the 2 months and 20 days of hunting.\r\n\r\n[384] Zin-i-murassa` kari-i-Farangi. The MSS. in the B.M. seem to\r\nhave zaram instead of zin.\r\n\r\n[385] Jahangir's words seem to imply that he caused the fowl's leg\r\nto be broken in order to try the experiment. Manucci, i, 55, has\r\na good deal to say about mumiya, though he admits that he had not\r\nhimself witnessed its effects. I do not find that Haji Baba descants\r\non its virtues, though at the end of the first chapter he says that his\r\nmother gave him an unguent which she said would cure all fractures. The\r\nPersian translator, no doubt rightly, has rendered the word 'unguent'\r\nby mumiya. With regard to the derivation of the word, may it not be\r\nconnected with mom, 'wax'? Vullers has a long article on the word.\r\n\r\n[386] The text has biradari, 'brotherhood,' but the true reading, as\r\nshown by the B.M. MSS., is bar awardi, br 'AUrdI, and this means either\r\nthe establishment of `Abdu-llah or a list submitted by him. Perhaps\r\n'list' is a better translation, the word awardi being connected with\r\nthe awarda-nawis of Wilson's Glossary.\r\n\r\n[387] The sentence is very obscure. MS. No. 181 I.O. has khun,\r\n'blood,' instead of chun, 'as,' and perhaps the meaning is blood\r\nin the breasts turns to milk on account of love for their cubs,\r\nand then the sucking by the latter increases the mother's natural\r\nferocity and the milk dries up.\r\n\r\n[388] In the B.M. MSS. the words are mansabdaran-i-riza-mansab. These\r\nlast two words are wanting in the text.\r\n\r\n[389] Text Patna, but B.M. MSS. have Thatta.\r\n\r\n[390] Text has Patna.\r\n\r\n[391] Text Kachhi, but it is Gajpati in B.M. MSS.\r\n\r\n[392] This seems taken from Abu-l-fazl. See Jarrett, iii, 115. The\r\nthird duty, which Jahangir calls \"worshipping fire,\" is by Abu-l-fazl\r\ntermed Yag, i.e. sacrifice.\r\n\r\n[393] It is the day of the full moon in Sawan that is holy.\r\n\r\n[394] Blochmann, p. 184, and Wilson's Glossary. Badayuni (Lowe, p. 269)\r\nspeaks of Akbar's wearing the rakhi on the 8th day of Virgo. I do not\r\nknow why Jahangir calls the day after the last day of Sawan the first\r\nday of the New Year. Perhaps ruz-i-duyam here means 'another day,' and\r\nnot 'the next day'; but then, if so, why is it the rakhi day, for that\r\nis in Sawan? The Hindu New Year begins in Baisakh (April). It will be\r\nobserved from Jarrett, ii, 17, that Sawan is also the name of a month\r\nof a particular length. Perhaps Jahangir has confused the two things.\r\n\r\n[395] It is the 10th of Aswin (September).\r\n\r\n[396] The text wrongly has dar har mah instead of only dar mah.\r\n\r\n[397] The negative in text is wrong apparently. It does not occur in\r\nMS. No. 181 I.O. nor in the B.M. MSS., which have ba instead of na.\r\n\r\n[398] That is, 9th Amurdad corresponded with the Hijra date of Akbar's\r\ndeath, viz. 13th Jumada-s-sani, which this year, 1022, occurred in\r\nJuly. According to the solar calendar Akbar's death was in October.\r\n\r\n[399] Pargalas seem to be clothes of some sort. Perhaps the word\r\nis another form of the fargul of Blochmann, p. 89. The text has\r\nsitarkani. Sitar means a veil, but probably we should read Sonargaoni,\r\n'of Sonargaon.' Both the MSS. give the number of elephants as 68\r\ninstead of 28 as in text.\r\n\r\n[400] See Jarrett, ii, 268, where it is said that an ancestor of\r\nBappa came to Berar.\r\n\r\n[401] According to Tod, Bappa, the ancestor of the Rana, acquired\r\nChitor in A.D. 728. Jahangir makes twenty-six princes rule for 1,010\r\nyears and twenty-six others only reign for 461 years! Tod says the\r\nlegendary ancestor Kenek Sen, the sixty-third from Loh, the son of\r\nRam, emigrated from the Panjab to Gujarat in 145 A.D. Perhaps the\r\nMewat of the Tuzuk is a mistake for Mewar.\r\n\r\n[402] Probably the town of that name in the Rajputana State of\r\nJhalawar. See \"Rajputana Gazetteer,\" ii, 211.\r\n\r\n[403] The Raushanis, called by their enemies the Tarikis.\r\n\r\n[404] Both Jahangir and Allah Akbar yield 288.\r\n\r\n[405] Sanskrit Devahara, 'an idol temple.'\r\n\r\n[406] \"Rajputana Gazetteer,\" ii, 69.\r\n\r\n[407] Instead of kaff ardi, 'a handful of flour,' the R.A.S. MS. has\r\nkaf az way, 'his spittle,' and this seems more likely.\r\n\r\n[408] Text ajnabi, 'foreign' or 'strange,' and Dowson had the same\r\nreading, for at vi, 337, we have the translation 'ships engaged in\r\nthe foreign trade of Surat.' But I adopt the reading of I.O. MS. 181,\r\nwhich is ajnasi, as it does not seem likely that Jahangir would\r\ninterest himself about 'foreign' ships.\r\n\r\n[409] \"Rajputana Gazetteer,\" ii, 63. There are now two large caldrons\r\n(dig) inside the darguh enclosure.\r\n\r\n[410] Hafiz Jamal was the name of the saint Mu`inu-d-din's daughter\r\n(\"Rajputana Gazetteer,\" ii, 62). It lies at the back of the Taragarh\r\nhill, and is now commonly called Nur-chashma. The fountains, etc.,\r\nare in a ruined state. Sir Thomas Roe visited this place (id., p. 123).\r\n\r\n[411] Shab-i-jum`a, which is Friday eve according to Blochmann.\r\n\r\n[412] Khusrau was married to his daughter.\r\n\r\n[413] The \"Arrogant of the Earth\" (Tod).\r\n\r\n[414] Perhaps this means Peshawar, for apparently Qilij was there\r\nwhen he died.\r\n\r\n[415] According to the Ma'asir, iii, 486, in the biography of `Isa\r\nKhan, Rustam was sent to put down the Tarkhans, and succeeded in doing\r\nso. See also ibid., p. 438, in the biography of Rustam, where it is\r\nsaid that Jahangir told him to send away the Arghuns. Perhaps the\r\npassage in Ma'asir, p. 438, which according to Blochmann, p. 314,\r\nmeans that Rustam ill-treated the Arghuns, rather means that he\r\nintrigued with them but oppressed the peasantry.\r\n\r\n[416] Though the text has Pulam, the real word seems to be Ilam or\r\nAilam. Ailam Guzar appears to be a pass in a range of hills. It may,\r\nhowever, be a ferry on the Kabul River. That river seems to be also\r\nknown as the Shah `Alam, and there is a ferry on it of that name. The\r\ntext speaks of Kot Tirah as 8 kos from Jalalabad, but Tirah is much\r\nfurther away. The B.M. MSS. have Kotal-i-Tirah, 'the Tirah defile.'\r\n\r\n[417] Compare Price's Jahangir, p. 94. It appears from that\r\naccount that Mu`taqid alias Lashkar Khan was originally called\r\nAbu-l-husain. According to the account there, the prisoners were\r\nbrought to Jahangir with the decapitated heads of 17,000 (!) suspended\r\nfrom their necks!\r\n\r\n[418] She was a daughter of Mir Mahmud, Akbar's secretary (Blochmann,\r\np. 449).\r\n\r\n[419] Man Singh died in the Deccan in 1614, and apparently in the\r\nmonth of June.\r\n\r\n[420] Text pidar by mistake for pisar.\r\n\r\n[421] Garha, described as Bandhu in Ma'asir, ii, 175. It is\r\nGarha-Katanga, i.e. Jabalpur.\r\n\r\n[422] Perhaps the meaning is that there was an eruption.\r\n\r\n[423] Buzurgan, which perhaps here means elder ladies of the harem.\r\n\r\n[424] This is Tash Beg (Blochmann, p. 457). The text wrongly has Patna.\r\n\r\n[425] Jahangir was born in this month, which then corresponded\r\nto Rajab.\r\n\r\n[426] Is this an allusion to some complimentary remark of Sir Thomas\r\nRoe? Sir Thomas did not come to Ajmir till December, 1615, but Jahangir\r\nis here apparently writing of what happened a year after his visit\r\nto Hafiz Jamal. The chronogram was 1024 (1615).\r\n\r\n[427] Mahall-i-Shah Nuru-d-din Jahangir, 1024 (1615). See Proceedings\r\nA.S.B. for August, 1873, pp. 159-60.\r\n\r\n[428] Salima died in the 7th year, so that the discovery must have\r\noccurred some time before this mention of it.\r\n\r\n[429] Hindustani, dhurpad, \"petit poëme ordinairement composé de\r\ncinq hémistiches sur une même rime.\" \"It was invented by Raja Man of\r\nGwalior\" (Garçin de Tassy, Hist. Litt. Hindouie, i, 12).\r\n\r\n[430] See Rieu, 741b, who calls the nauras a treatise on music\r\ncomposed by Ibrahim `Adil Shah II. This `Adil Shah was Firishta's\r\npatron, and reigned till 1626. Jamalu-d-din is the dictionary-maker\r\nand friend of Sir T. Roe. The sentence about reporting the remainder\r\nof the facts seems to be an extract from his report. Muhammad Waris,\r\nin his continuation of the Padshah-nama, B.M. MS. Add. 6556, p. 438,\r\nmentions, with reprobation, that `Adil Shah had given his niece in\r\nmarriage to a singer.\r\n\r\n[431] Translated Elliot, vi, 339.\r\n\r\n[432] Lit. procure for him the sign of the blessed panja (five\r\nfingers). The sign-manual was that of Jahangir. See below. See also\r\nTod's Rajasthan, reprint, i, 411, for a representation of the panja;\r\nalso p. 383, note id.\r\n\r\n[433] Panja mubarak (Tod's Rajasthan, i, 383 and 411).\r\n\r\n[434] Perhaps the uncle and Haridas, or the inha, 'them' may mean\r\nthe farman. See Elliot, vi, 340, which has 'my letters.' Tod has\r\ntranslated this part of the Tuzuk, i, 382.\r\n\r\n[435] The text has khaurmiyan, and I. O. 181 has khaur-i-bandar. Khaur\r\nmeans a bay or gulf in Arabic. The battle is that between Captain\r\nDownton and the Portuguese, which took place in January, 1615, and is\r\ndescribed in Orme's Hist., Fragments, p. 351, etc. See also Danvers'\r\n\"Portuguese in India,\" ii. 170. The engagement was in the Swally\r\nchannel.\r\n\r\n[436] Elliot, vi, 340. As Mr. Rogers remarks, the sentence is not\r\neasily intelligible. Probably the translation should be, \"No one\r\nremained (all the Rajputs having been killed) who could finish off\r\nMalik `Ambar.\"\r\n\r\n[437] Probably the father or grandfather of the Muhammad Beg Zu-l-faqar\r\nwho was a servant of Aurangzib (Ma'asiru-l-umara, ii, 89).\r\n\r\n[438] R.A.S. MS. has Dayanat Khan, and so has I.O. MS. 181.\r\n\r\n[439] Qulba. It does not appear that this is a land-measure.\r\n\r\n[440] Kharwar. It is a weight. See Jarrett, ii, 394, where a kharwar\r\nis said to be equal to ten Hindustani maunds.\r\n\r\n[441] Probably this was the son who died in the 14th year (Tuzuk,\r\np. 282).\r\n\r\n[442] Should be 18th. See Elliot, vi, 341. I.O. 181 has 20th, and\r\nthis is probably correct, bistam and hashtam being often mistaken\r\nfor one another by the copyists. B.M. MS. Add. 26215 has dushamba,\r\nMonday, instead of shamba, Saturday.\r\n\r\n[443] Akbar used the word parm narm, 'very soft,' as a substitute for\r\n'shawl' (Blochmann, p. 90).\r\n\r\n[444] According to Gladwin, 96 tanks = one sir. Four mashas make a\r\ntank, and a masha is about 18 grains troy.\r\n\r\n[445] Text k-hyt'h chAr, kheta char. But the two B.M. MSS. which I have\r\nconsulted have no ya, and have khatta or ghatta char. I think that\r\nthe word must be ghata, which in Sanskrit means a troop of elephants\r\nassembled for war. I am not sure what the word char means, but perhaps\r\nit is only an affix. According to Abu-l-fazl a herd of (wild) elephants\r\nis called sahn (Blochmann, p. 122).\r\n\r\n[446] Panj tuquz, i.e. 9 by 5. The text has tAqUr, taqur.\r\n\r\n[447] The B.M. MSS. seem to have panch kunjar, 'five elephants,'\r\ni.e. equal to five elephants(?).\r\n\r\n[448] In Sarkar Delhi (Jarrett, ii, 287).\r\n\r\n[449] The text does not expressly say that the dervish foretold\r\ntwo years before his death the period of his death, but apparently\r\nJahangir means this, for he goes on to speak of the time mentioned\r\nfor his delivery. See also Iqbal-nama, p. 81, where the dervish is\r\ncalled Hafiz, and where it is added that the whole population of\r\nSrinagar followed the bier.\r\n\r\n[450] Lit. give it, for the Koran cannot be directly sold.\r\n\r\n[451] Text pisar, 'son of Buland Ray.' but from the B.M. MSS. it\r\nappears that pisar is a mistake for Sar.\r\n\r\n[452] Blochmann, p. 387. Possibly he was the part author of a\r\ntranslation of Babar's Commentaries.\r\n\r\n[453] The name is wrong. The Iqbal-nama, p. 84, has Rasht (Rashd),\r\nwhich is a well-known town on the Caspian.\r\n\r\n[454] According to the Iqbal-nama the true reading is sanjaki (see\r\np. 84). But Olearius, who gives a full account of the murder (p. 352\r\nof English translation, ed. 1662), says Bihbud gave him two stabs\r\nwith a chentze, which is a kind of poniard.\r\n\r\n[455] A Persian festival in memory of a rain which fell on the 13th\r\nTir and put an end to a famine (Bahar-i-`ajam).\r\n\r\n[456] Sangram was Raja of Khurkpur in Behar, and was killed in battle\r\nwith Jahangir Quli Khan (Blochmann, p. 446, note).\r\n\r\n[457] Shakwa'i-sahib-i-Suba. I presume it means a complaint against\r\nthe governor, and perhaps one made by Kesho.\r\n\r\n[458] The pearls are omitted in the MSS.\r\n\r\n[459] It is phul in MS. No. 181.\r\n\r\n[460] Takhti, qu. a signet? No. 181 has a lal takhti.\r\n\r\n[461] Sir Thomas Roe's friend.\r\n\r\n[462] Text wrongly has 3 instead of 30.\r\n\r\n[463] Apparently because born in Lahore (see Blochmann, p. 500).\r\n\r\n[464] According to I.O. MS. 181 every zamindar took some money from\r\nChin Qilij and sent him out of his estate, and this seems to be\r\nthe probable meaning, for we are told later on that the zamindars\r\nplundered Chin Qilij.\r\n\r\n[465] Tirhut. R.A.S. MS. has \"It chanced that the zamindar of this\r\nplace was with Jahangir Quli, and the latter sent him with some\r\npeople to seize Chin Qilij.\" I.O. MS. has the same, and this seems\r\ncorrect. The text has \"It chanced that the zamindar of that place was\r\nspending some days in that neighbourhood(?).\" Perhaps a negative has\r\nbeen omitted before 'spending.' I.O. MS. seems to have Johirhat as\r\nthe name of the zamindar's estate.\r\n\r\n[466] Apparently the verse is quoted with reference to Jahangir Quli's\r\nfailure to exact retribution from the zamindars, There is an account\r\nof Chin Qilij in the Ma'asir, iii, 351.\r\n\r\n[467] Gunth, a breed of small horses or ponies.\r\n\r\n[468] A farji is a coat (see Blochmann, p. 89).\r\n\r\n[469] Text in ruba`i, 'this quatrain,' which does not seem to make\r\nsense. Perhaps in here should be ayin-i-ruba`i, 'the rules or the\r\ncustom of a quatrain.' Similarly, in kitabat five lines down may be\r\nayin-i-kitabat, 'the rules of writing.'\r\n\r\n[470] His father was Khalilu-llah, previously mentioned in the Tuzuk,\r\nand who had lately died (Iqbal-nama, p, 84, and Tuzuk, pp. 62 and\r\n69). Tahmasp gave Ni`matu-llah's daughter in marriage to his own\r\nson Isma`il.\r\n\r\n[471] Khanish Khanim in Ma'asir, iii, 339.\r\n\r\n[472] Ishal-i-kabd.\r\n\r\n[473] Two I.O. MSS. and the R.A.S. MS. have 18 instead of 15. Elliot\r\nhas \"up to my fourteenth\" year. Jahangir was born in Rabi`, 977,\r\nor 31st August, 1569, and the beginning of wine-drinking to which he\r\nrefers must have taken place at earliest in January, 1586. He tells us\r\nthat it was after the death of Muhammad Hakim, and at the time when\r\nhis father was at Attock. Now Akbar arrived there on 15th Muharram,\r\n994, according to Nizamu-d-din, and on 12th Day, 994, according to\r\nAbu-l-fazl, iii, 976, i.e. about the end of December, 1585, and at\r\nthat time Jahangir was 17 years and 4 months of age, or in his 18th\r\nyear. He continued to drink heavily for nine years, i.e. till he was\r\n26 (17 + 9), then he moderated for seven years, i.e. till he was 33,\r\nand he kept to that for fifteen years more, i.e. till he was 48. These\r\nyears were lunar years, and he tells that at the time of writing he\r\nwas 47 years and 9 months old, according to the lunar calendar. It\r\nseems to follow that the MSS. are right, and that we should read 18.\r\n\r\n[474] Elliot, vi, 341.\r\n\r\n[475] The two good I.O. MSS. have, not murgh or murghi, but tughdari\r\nor tughdari, a 'bustard,' unless indeed the word be taghaddi,\r\n'breakfast.' But probably the word is tughdari, a bustard, and the\r\nreference is to the particular memorable day when he first drank\r\nwine. His food that day, he says, was a bustard with bread and a radish\r\n(turb).\r\n\r\n[476] Blochmann. Calcutta Review, 1869, has 'turnips.'\r\n\r\n[477] Filuniya. The word is not given in ordinary dictionaries, but\r\nit is explained in Dozy's Supplement. It is stated there that it is\r\na sedative electuary, and that the word is derived from the Greek,\r\nbeing philônia, which is the name of an antidote or drug invented\r\nby Philon of Tarsus. There is an account of Philon and a reference\r\nto his drug in Smith's Classical Dictionary. Philon lived in or\r\nbefore the first century after Christ, and is referred to by Galen\r\nand others. The word as given there is philôneion. We are not told\r\nwhat it was made of. In Price's Jahangir, filuniya, misread there\r\nas Kelourica, is described by Jahangir as brother's son to tiryaq,\r\ni.e. theriaca (see Price, p. 6). Tiryak or tiryaq is supposed to be a\r\nGreek word (see Lane), and means an antidote against poison, etc. It\r\nis so used in the verse from Avicenna quoted by Jahangir to his son\r\nShah Jahan. See D'Herbelot, s.v. Teriak. But it is also often used\r\napparently as a synonym for opium. The mixing of wine with spirits\r\nwas intended to dilute the potation, for hitherto Jahangir had been\r\ntaking raw spirit. A misqal is said to be 63 1/2 grains troy, and so\r\n18 misqals would be about 3 ounces, and the six cups would be about\r\n1 1/2 lb. troy. In Elliot, Jahangir is made to say that he does not\r\ndrink on Thursdays and Fridays. But the shab-i-jum`a, as Blochmann\r\nhas pointed out elsewhere, Ayin translation, p. 171, n. 3, means\r\nThursday night or Friday eve, and this is clearly the case here,\r\nfor Jahangir speaks of the eve's being followed by a blessed day. It\r\nshould be noted that there is no connection in Jahangir's mind between\r\nabstaining from wine and abstaining from meat. He did not eat meat\r\non Thursdays or Sundays because he did not approve of taking life on\r\nthese days, but he drank on both of them.\r\n\r\n[478] Cf. Blochmann's translation and Calcutta Review for 1869.\r\n\r\n[479] I understand the two exceptions (du chiz) to be that on Thursdays\r\nhe drank in the daytime, contrary to the general rule of only drinking\r\nat night, and that on Thursday evenings he did not drink.\r\n\r\n[480] Elliot, vi, 343.\r\n\r\n[481] The MSS. have Jadun Ray and Baba Chokanth (Jiu Kanth?). The\r\nMa'asiru-l-umara, ii, 646, has Maluji Kantiya. The text has Babu\r\nKantiya.\r\n\r\n[482] The text is corrupt. The Ma'asir, id., has Atash instead\r\nof Danish.\r\n\r\n[483] The text is corrupt. In the second line of the verse the\r\ntext has guft, which seems meaningless, and two I.O. MSS. and\r\nB.M. MS. Add. 26,215 have jang, 'battle.' The R.A.S. MS. has pay,\r\n'feet,' which seems to me the best reading. Possibly guft should be\r\nread kift, 'shoulder.'\r\n\r\n[484] It will be remembered that Jahangir has called `Ambar's army\r\nthe army of darkness, alluding perhaps to `Ambar's being an Abyssinian.\r\n\r\n[485] Elliot, vi, and Blochmann, p. 479, n. 3.\r\n\r\n[486] Perhaps it should be phanga or feringha, a grasshopper, or it may\r\nbe jhingur, a cockroach. Presumably the country was covered with thick\r\njungle, and the cloud of insects indicated where water was. Erskine's\r\nMS. has chika. B.M. Or. 3276 has chika or jika. Possibly the word is\r\njhingur, a cockroach (see Blochmann in J.A.S.B. for 1871, vol. xl). He\r\nquotes a Hindustani Dict., which says that the jhinga is what in Arabic\r\nis called the jaradu-l-bahr or water-locust. The river referred to\r\nby Jahangir is the Sankh of I.G., xii, 222. V. Ball, Proc. A.S.B. for\r\n1881, p. 42, suggests that the jhinga may be thunder-stones!\r\n\r\n[487] Compare Tavernier's account of the searching for diamonds in\r\nSambhalpur (vol. ii, p. 311, of ed. of 1676).\r\n\r\n[488] Text, khud-hunarkari, 'his own workmanship,' but the MSS. have\r\nkhud-sarkari. See also Iqbal-nama, p. 87, which says that Jamalu-d-din\r\nhad had it made in Bijapur.\r\n\r\n[489] Really a topaz. Tavernier points out that the natives call\r\nvarious precious stones rubies, distinguishing them by their colour.\r\n\r\n[490] Text, ba-andaza-i-mu`tad-i-man, 'of capacity corresponding to\r\nmy custom.' Presumably it was a drinking-cup, and held Jahangir's\r\ncustomary potation.\r\n\r\n[491] Halqa ba-gushan. Apparently referring to his being one of those\r\nwho bored their ears in imitation of Jahangir.\r\n\r\n[492] The text is corrupt. The true reading seems to be sad\r\ndana-i-kish, 'one hundred pieces of muslin' (?). I.O. 181 seems to\r\nhave kabsh, 'rams'.\r\n\r\n[493] Here follow two unintelligible words, Pagana Bankana.\r\n\r\n[494] Perhaps this should be faghfuri, 'porcelain.'\r\n\r\n[495] Jauhar-dar, defined by Vullers as bone or wood bearing veins,\r\ni.e. striated.\r\n\r\n[496] See Akbar-nama, ii, 315. It was sent before Jahangir was\r\nborn. It, too, was an African elephant.\r\n\r\n[497] Here the two words referred to at note 2 on p. 321 are repeated.\r\n\r\n[498] Ma'asiru-l-umara. i, 736. Khan `Alam's name was Mirza Barkhurdar.\r\n\r\n[499] This seems wrong; the number of horse would probably not\r\nbe reduced.\r\n\r\n[500] So in text, but No. 181 has 600, and this is more likely,\r\nfor the number of horse is never, I think, larger than the zat rank.\r\n\r\n[501] I.O. MSS. have 18th.\r\n\r\n[502] I.O. MSS. have 20th.\r\n\r\n[503] The two I.O. MSS. have the following sentence here: \"On this\r\nday it happened that however much I tried to write, my heart and hand\r\nwould not act. Whenever I seized the pen my condition altered. At\r\nlast I had to tell I`timadu-d-daulah to write.\"\r\n\r\n[504] This sentence is not in the I.O. MSS.\r\n\r\n[505] Here comes the passage which the two I.O. MSS. enter higher up.\r\n\r\n[506] I.O. MS. 181 has \"writes that on the 11th,\" etc.\r\n\r\n[507] The I.O. MSS. add here \"of the 11th year.\"\r\n\r\n[508] Probably this is the Chimni Begam, a daughter of Shah Jahan,\r\nwhose grave is near that of the saint Khwaja Mu`inu-d-din Chishti\r\n(\"Rajputana Gazetteer,\" ii, 62). Probably Chimni should be Chamani,\r\nwhich means 'verdant' and comes from chaman, a garden. Perhaps she\r\ndied of smallpox. It was in the summer.\r\n\r\n[509] Apparently the reference is to the parents of the child and to\r\nthe grandfather, that is, the writer of this notice.\r\n\r\n[510] I.O. MSS. have Monday, the 6th Tir, and say that Jahangir went\r\nto Chashma-i-Nur on the 9th, which they say was a Thursday. And we\r\nsee later that Jahangir speaks of Saturday as the 11th.\r\n\r\n[511] The word 'dagger' is omitted in the text.\r\n\r\n[512] I.O. MSS. have bar daur, 'round.'\r\n\r\n[513] Elliot, vi, 346. There is a better account of the plague in\r\nthe Iqbal-nama, pp. 88, 89.\r\n\r\n[514] The words are dar wilayat, and may mean 'any country' or 'any\r\nforeign country.'\r\n\r\n[515] The son of the historian Nizamu-d-din. Sir T. Roe refers to\r\nthis affair.\r\n\r\n[516] Text Anand, but this makes no sense. The I.O. MSS. have amba,\r\nmangoes, and though the remark seems abrupt this is no doubt the\r\ncorrect reading. Jahangir was particularly fond of mangoes, and perhaps\r\nhe is here playing on the similarity between the words amba and anand.\r\n\r\n[517] In Sarkar Saharanpur (Jarrett, ii, 292). It is now in the\r\nMuzaffarnagar district (I.G., vii, 308).\r\n\r\n[518] \"It is a pity that no trace of these is left at Agra. Had\r\nthere been, they would have been the wonder of the age\" (note of\r\nSayyid Ahmad). Perhaps they are the two figures which have generally\r\nbeen supposed to have been put up by Akbar and to represent Chitor\r\nheroes. The word tarkib in the text may mean that they were mounted\r\nstatues. But then the description of them as marble statues would\r\nbe wrong.\r\n\r\n[519] Text has gusfand-i-nar, 'a ram,' but the MSS. have gusfand u\r\nbar, or buz, and it is evident that the true reading is 'a sheep,\r\na goat.' See Blochmann, p. 266, where goats are mentioned among\r\nthe animals distributed by Akbar. The number of animals distributed\r\ncorresponded with the years of Jahangir's age (48) multiplied by 3, and\r\nso would be 48 × 3 = 144 (see Blochmann, l.c.). The weight of Jahangir\r\nwas 6,514 tulchas, and Blochmann (p. 267, n.) takes this to be the\r\nsame as tolas, and estimates Jahangir's weight at 210 1/2 lb. troy or\r\n15 stone. Probably this is excessive, and his weight might be 82 sir\r\nor about 2 maunds, i.e. 164 lb. or 11 1/2 stone. The perfumes against\r\nwhich he was weighed were ambergris, not amber (which has no scent),\r\n`ud, i.e. lignum aloes, and ban (not pan as in text), which apparently\r\nis the same as luban, 'frankincense' (see the chapter on perfumes in\r\nBlochmann, p. 77). I am not sure of the meaning of the phrase ba-dast\r\nnihada. The MSS. have not the preposition ba. Perhaps the meaning is\r\n'put them into the hands of the fakirs.' Jahangir was born on the\r\n18th Shahriwar, 977 = 31st August, 1569. The weighings described in\r\nthe text took place on the 26th Shahriwar. Perhaps this was because\r\nhis birthday was on the 24th Shahriwar according to the Jalali year.\r\n\r\n[520] Generally written taghma, 'a badge of honour,' 'a medal,' etc.\r\n\r\n[521] See Tuzuk, p. 11, Blochmann, p. 482, and Ma'asiru-l-umara, iii,\r\n355. The statement at Tuzuk, p. 11, about Delhi seems a mistake, and\r\nis not in the MSS. Mirza `Ali came from Badakhshan. He is frequently\r\nmentioned in vol. iii of the Akbar-nama.\r\n\r\n[522] This is the same phrase as, according to the MSS., occurs at\r\np. 11. Apparently the ulus referred to is the Timuride family to\r\nwhich Jahangir belonged. It is connected with Mirza `Ali's title\r\nof Akbarshahi.\r\n\r\n[523] See in Blochmann, l.c., the affecting story of his death.\r\n\r\n[524] This letter being of the usual Persian style, and having nothing\r\nto do with Jahangir's history, is omitted. It relates to the sending\r\nof Muhammad Husain Chelebi with presents to the emperor, and to the\r\noffering his services for the purchase of jewels, etc.\r\n\r\n[525] Text 20th Aban, but the MSS. have 8th, and this is clearly\r\nright. By the latter part of the sentence Jahangir means that\r\nShah Jahan was to start first, and that he himself was to leave\r\nafterwards. The \"auspicious palace\" referred to in the next sentence\r\nis apparently Shah Jahan's establishment. Jahangir did not leave\r\nfor about a fortnight. Though Shah Jahan and the establishment\r\n(daulat-khana-i-humayun) made a start on the 8th or 9th Aban, he did\r\nnot finally leave till the 20th Aban. See infra.\r\n\r\n[526] Author of Iqbal-nama.\r\n\r\n[527] 'Of body like Krishna, or like a flute'?\r\n\r\n[528] According to Roe, it was not the English carriage, but a\r\ncopy. Perhaps Jahangir had the original carriage and Shah Jahan\r\nthe copy.\r\n\r\n[529] Elliot, vi, 346.\r\n\r\n[530] The day was Saturday, not Tuesday, and it is Saturday in the MSS.\r\n\r\n[531] Elliot has Deo Rani, and it is Deo Rani in I.O. MS. 305.\r\n\r\n[532] Jahangir arrived in Ajmir on the 26th Aban, 1022, and left it on\r\nthe 21st Aban, 1025. The Muhammadan dates are 5th Shawwal, 1022, and\r\n1st Zi-l-qa`da, 1025 = 18th November, 1613, and 10th November, 1616.\r\n\r\n[533] Text tar, but MSS. have abtar, i.e. inferior and perhaps low\r\nland. The text seems corrupt.\r\n\r\n[534] MSS. have 86,500 horse and 347,000 foot, and this agrees with\r\nthe Ayin (Jarrett, ii, 272).\r\n\r\n[535] Text wrongly has Nil. The tank in question is the Bisalya tank\r\nof the Rajputana Gazetteer, ii, 4, which was made by Bisal Deo Chohan\r\nabout 1050 A.D. It is described in Tod's \"Personal Narrative,\" i, 824,\r\nof Calcutta reprint. It is, or was, about 8 miles in circumference\r\nand is about a mile west of the Anasagar, which was made by Bisal\r\nDeo's grandson.\r\n\r\n[536] About 20 miles south-east of Ajmir.\r\n\r\n[537] This is the name of a water-bird in Turki. It is also called\r\nmagh and water-crow (zagh-i-ab), and in Hindi jalkawa (note of\r\nSayyid Ahmad).\r\n\r\n[538] Probably the meaning is that he allowed those who wished to\r\ndrink to do so. Many, or at least some, would be abstainers.\r\n\r\n[539] Namuda in MSS.\r\n\r\n[540] Sahal in MSS.\r\n\r\n[541] In Sarkar Marosor (Jarrett, ii, 208). It was in Malwa. But the\r\nI.O. MSS. have Nauda.\r\n\r\n[542] Text Udaipur, but this was not on the border of the Rana's\r\nterritory, and the MSS. have Dudpur.\r\n\r\n[543] Perhaps the Toda of Sir T. Roe.\r\n\r\n[544] Lyasa in MSS.\r\n\r\n[545] Son of Nizamu-d-din the historian.\r\n\r\n[546] Gorana in MSS. and the distance 2 1/4 kos and 1 jarib.\r\n\r\n[547] 23rd in MSS.\r\n\r\n[548] Manpur in text.\r\n\r\n[549] MSS. 2,000 rupees.\r\n\r\n[550] Perhaps Kanha Das.\r\n\r\n[551] Should be Fath-jang as in MSS.\r\n\r\n[552] Jarrett, ii, 195.\r\n\r\n[553] The name seems to be wrong. Jahangir is evidently copying from\r\nthe Ayin, and the rivers mentioned there (Jarrett, ii, 195) are the\r\nNarbada, Sipra, Kalisindh, Betwa, and the Kodi (or Godi).\r\n\r\n[554] 29,668 (Jarrett, ii. 198).\r\n\r\n[555] The MSS. also have sweet pomegranates from Yezd, and sub-acid\r\n(may-khwush) ones from Farah, and pears from Badakhshan (see Elliot,\r\nvi, 348).\r\n\r\n[556] The MSS. have khassa-i-sharifa.\r\n\r\n[557] Qu. komla? Instead of qabiltar the MSS. have ma'iltar.\r\n\r\n[558] Pahna'i. Its area or shade. Perhaps the 175 1/2 are yards,\r\nnot cubits.\r\n\r\n[559] Evidently the four-horned antelope, the Tetracerus\r\nquadricornis of Blanford, p. 520, and which has the Hindustani name\r\nof doda. Blanford describes its colour as dull pale brown. \"The\r\nposterior horns are much larger than the anterior ones, which are\r\nsituated between the orbits and are often mere knobs. It is the only\r\nIndian representative of the duikarbok of Africa. Another Indian name\r\nis chausingha. In jungle this species and the hog-deer may easily be\r\nmistaken the one for the other. It is not gregarious, and moves with\r\na peculiar jerky action.\" The resemblance between the four-horned\r\nantelope and the hog-deer--the kutah paycha or short-legged deer of\r\nBabar and Jahangir--may account for Blanford's giving doda as a native\r\nname for the hog-deer (Cervus porcinus). For Babar's description of\r\nthe kutah paya or paycha see Erskine, p. 317. Gladwin in his history\r\nof Jahangir writes the native name as Dirdhayan.\r\n\r\n[560] Blochmann, p. 493.\r\n\r\n[561] Text, khurma, a date, but evidently the khurma-i-Hind or\r\nthe tamarind, i.e. 'the palm of India,' is meant (see Babar's Mem.,\r\nErskine, p. 324). I do not understand the measurements. The word yak,\r\n'one,' before the word shakh is not in the MSS. and is, I think,\r\nwrong. I think the 16 gaz and 15 1/2 gaz are the lengths of the two\r\nbranches, and that the measurements 2 1/2 and 2 3/4 gaz refer to the\r\nlength and circumference of the two branches at the place when they\r\nstarted from the trunk and before they put out leaves.\r\n\r\n[562] Hindwas or Hindawas in MSS.\r\n\r\n[563] This is in accordance with and probably derived from Babar's\r\nCommentaries, Erskine, p. 51, where he says that 1,584 years have\r\nelapsed from the time when Bikramajit made his observatory. Erskine\r\ntakes this to show that Babar was writing in 934, and if we add 92\r\nyears, or the difference between 934 and 1026, we get 1,676 years\r\n(or 1,675 if we take the year to be 1025).\r\n\r\n[564] See Jarrett, ii, 196. Abu-l-fazl says there that the flow\r\noccurred a week before his arrival at Ujjain.\r\n\r\n[565] Cf. Jarrett, ii, 196.\r\n\r\n[566] Sanyasi-i-murtaz.\r\n\r\n[567] Text, mihrabi-shakl uftada, 'a place like a\r\nprayer-niche.' Possibly the true reading is majra bi-shakl uftada,\r\n'a passage without form.' However, the MSS. have mihrab. The account\r\nin the text may be compared with the Ma'asiru-l-umara, i, 574, and with\r\nthe Iqbal-nama, p. 94. The measurements of the mouth of the hole in the\r\nMa'asir are taken from the Iqbal-nama, and differ from the account in\r\nthe Tuzuk. The Ma'asir, following the Iqbal-nama, calls the ascetic\r\nAchhad or Ajhad. It also gives his subsequent history. He went to\r\nMathura and was there cruelly beaten by Hakim Beg. Jahangir's visit\r\nto Jadrup is referred to by Sir Thomas Roe, who mentions a report\r\nthat the saint was said to be 300 years old. Jahangir does not say\r\nany such nonsense.\r\n\r\n[568] See Jarrett, iii, 271, etc. The Sanskrit word is Asrama,\r\nor Ashrama.\r\n\r\n[569] Left shoulder in Ayin.\r\n\r\n[570] Sanskrit, Vanaprastha.\r\n\r\n[571] Text qat`i dar miyan alat nihada, but apparently this should\r\nbe alat qat` ba miyan nihada: that is, \"membrum virile in involucris\r\nreponens.\"\r\n\r\n[572] Text, sarb biyasi, which may mean 'distributing everything.' The\r\nIqbal-nama, p. 96, has sarb nasi, 'destroying everything.'\r\n\r\n[573] I.O. MS. No. 306 says nothing about a garden, but speaks of a\r\nvillage Khirwar and of halting under a mango-tree. Nor does No. 305\r\nmention a garden.\r\n\r\n[574] Cf. Elliot, vi, 348. The MSS. say nothing about two sons.\r\n\r\n[575] From the \"Gulistan.\"\r\n\r\n[576] Cf. Jarrett, ii, 197. The story is also told with many more\r\ndetails in Price's Jahangir, p. 108 etc.\r\n\r\n[577] Text, Madan. But the name is Mandan, as MS. No. 181 and the\r\nAyin-i-Akbari (Jarrett, ii, 197) show. The legend is intended to show\r\nhow Mandu got its name (see also Tiefenthaler, i, 353).\r\n\r\n[578] Elliot, vi. 348.\r\n\r\n[579] Monday, the 23rd Isfandarmuz, the day on which he reached\r\nMandu. It was about the 6th March, 1617.\r\n\r\n[580] The MSS. have 1,672.\r\n\r\n[581] See Elliot, vi, 351 and 362, note. Jahangir only gives details of\r\nthe 17,167 animals killed by himself. The mhaka is possibly a clerical\r\nerror for mar-khwur. The text says it is allied to the gawazn, but the\r\nMSS. have gur, a wild ass. The details of the quadrupeds come to 3,203,\r\nthe total stated by Jahangir. The details of the birds come to 13,954,\r\nbut the 10 crocodiles bring up the figures to 13,964, and the total\r\n3,203 + 13,964 comes to the 17,167 mentioned. It has been suggested to\r\nme that the mhaka of the text is the maha or swamp-deer of the Terai,\r\nRucervus Duvaucelli.\r\n\r\n[582] The MSS. have Saturday instead of Tuesday, and this seems\r\nreasonable, for there were no offerings on Tuesday (see infra).\r\n\r\n[583] Text, Sakar. Now locally called the Sagan, 'sea,' tank.\r\n\r\n[584] The MSS. only speak of twelve.\r\n\r\n[585] The MSS. seem to have merely ba tir-i-banduq, 'with bullets.'\r\n\r\n[586] Biyana in text.\r\n\r\n[587] That is, apparently, the journey back by sea from the Deccan. The\r\nMSS. have Hasan instead of Husain, and say the route by Ormuz was\r\nclosed. Perhaps the ba Mir of text is a mistake for bar bahr, 'by sea.'\r\n\r\n[588] Tuquz means nine in Turki.\r\n\r\n[589] The I.O. MSS. seem to have Sakakdar or Sakakandar.\r\n\r\n[590] It appears from Shah `Abbas's letter to Jahangir (Tuzuk, p. 165)\r\nthat Muhammad Husain Chelebi had been employed by Jahangir to collect\r\ncurios in Persia.\r\n\r\n[591] Note by Sayyid Ahmad. They say that a poet recited this\r\nimpromptu couplet--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Though Nur-Jahan be in form a woman,\r\nIn the ranks of men she's a tiger-slayer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe point of this couplet is that before Nur-Jahan entered Jahangir's\r\nharem she was the wife of Shir-afgan, the tiger-slayer. The line may\r\nalso read \"In battle she is a man-smiter and a tiger-slayer.\"\r\n\r\n[592] The two I.O. MSS. have \"a pair of pearls and a diamond.\"\r\n\r\n[593] There is a fuller account of this flute-player in Price's\r\nJahangir, p. 114. The melody which he composed in Jahangir's name\r\nis there called by Price Saut Jahangiri. (The text does not give\r\nthe name Jahangiri.) It is there stated that Shah Jahan brought the\r\nflute-player with him from Burhanpur and introduced him.\r\n\r\n[594] Hauza-dari, 'with a basin-shaped litter on it.'\r\n\r\n[595] The word pashida, 'scattered,' does not occur in the\r\nI.O. MSS. But perhaps the word has two opposite meanings.\r\n\r\n[596] Father and son both died apparently at the same age.\r\n\r\n[597] It was in Sarkar Qanauj (Jarrett, ii, 185). It is Chibramau of\r\nI.G., iii, 97, and is in Farrukhabad district.\r\n\r\n[598] Urvasi is the name of an Apsara or celestial nymph. Probably it\r\nis here the name of a dress. (In Forbes's Hindustani Dictionary urbasi\r\nis said to denote a particular kind of ornament worn on the breast.)\r\n\r\n[599] The MSS. have maghra, which may be connected with the Arabic\r\nmaghr, 'travelling quickly.' It may be the name of a courier, or\r\nmerely mean 'quickly.'\r\n\r\n[600] Apparently it should be Bhim; see infra. Gadeha is probably Gadhi\r\nin Khandesh; see Lethbridge's \"Golden Book of India,\" p. 138. It is the\r\nGarvi of I.G., v, 33, and is one of the Bhil States in the Dang Tract.\r\n\r\n[601] There was a Bodah in Sarkar Marosor in Malwa, but its revenue\r\nwas only 2 1/2 lakhs of dams (Jarrett, ii, 208). The two I.O. MSS. and\r\nDebi Prasad's Hindi version have Toda. Toda was in Ajmir, Rantambhor\r\nSarkar, and its revenue in Akbar's time was 1 1/2 lakhs of rupees\r\n(Jarrett, ii, 275).\r\n\r\n[602] Ode 192 of Brockhaus' edition, p. 112, first couplet.\r\n\r\n[603] This is the building described by William Finch. See the Journal\r\nof John Jourdain, ed. by Foster for the Hakluyt Society, App. D. Finch\r\nspeaks of a high turret 170 steps high. The tower was the Tower of\r\nVictory erected by Sultan Mahmud I in 1443 to commemorate a victory\r\nover the Raja of Chitor. \"The stump of it has been found.\" Jourdain\r\nspeaks of six storeys. It was built of green stone like marble.\r\n\r\n[604] Two hundred rupees per storey(?).\r\n\r\n[605] Blochmann, p. 371, and Ma'asiru-l-umara, ii, 537. Now locally\r\ncalled the Nil-kanth, 'blue neck.'\r\n\r\n[606] The text misses out a conjunction before sada.\r\n\r\n[607] Apparently the meaning is that the standard of two and three\r\nhorses had not been kept up.\r\n\r\n[608] Some lines of this agree with the verses in the Akbar-nama,\r\nii, 190. The last two lines are quoted again in the account of the\r\n15th year (p. 299 of Persian text).\r\n\r\n[609] The account is obscure. Elliot's translation is \"In the root\r\nof the tree is found a lump of sweet substance which is exactly like\r\nthat of Faluda. It is eaten by the poor.\" The text and some MSS. have\r\nyak parcha-i-shirini, but B. M. Or. 3276 has yak para. Roxburgh says\r\nnothing about any such growth on the wild plantain. Faluda or paluda\r\nis the name of a sweetmeat.\r\n\r\n[610] It is curious that the word amukhta, 'taught,' in the text,\r\nand which appears to be almost necessary for the sense, does not\r\noccur either in the two I. O. MSS. or in the R. A. S. one. Burhanpur\r\nis about 100 miles as the crow flies south-south-east of Mandu.\r\n\r\n[611] The text has par, 'feathers,' instead of the sign of the\r\ncomparative tar, but the MSS. have kalantar.\r\n\r\n[612] The word is hawali, which is sometimes translated\r\n'neighbourhood,' and has been so translated here by Mr. Rogers. But\r\neither Jahangir has made a mistake or the word hawali is capable\r\nof a wide interpretation, for Jaitpur appears to be Jaitpur in\r\nKathiawar. See Jarrett, ii, 258. and I. G., vii, 192. Possibly Mandu\r\nis a mistake for Bandhu. But there is a Jetgarh in Malwa (Jarrett,\r\nii, 200).\r\n\r\n[613] Probably this was the author who collaborated with Jerome\r\nXavier. See Rieu's Catalogue, iii, 1077.\r\n\r\n[614] I. O. MS. 305 has dana-i-naziki, 'soft (or small) seeds.'\r\n\r\n[615] Note 181 has wasil gashtan. 'becoming united' (to the Deity).\r\n\r\n[616] Ja dadan, 'to give way,' the meaning apparently being that\r\nthey had protected Ruhu-llah's murderers. But I. O. MS. 305 seems to\r\nhave jawidan, 'eternal,' which would mean that they were killed and\r\nalso eternally disgraced as rebels. The Ma'asiru-l-umara, iii, 13,\r\nhas a different account of the manner of Ruhu-llah's death. He was\r\nFida'i's elder brother.\r\n\r\n[617] The I. O. MSS. have Pir Bahar and Chandra Kona, which latter\r\nmay be the place in Midnapur.\r\n\r\n[618] Text 8th, but should be 20th. See p. 196, where the next Thursday\r\nis mentioned as the 27th. See Elliot, vi, 351.\r\n\r\n[619] Text 15 months and 11 days, but it should be 11 months. Shah\r\nJahan left his father at Ajmir on the last day of Shawwal, 1025,\r\nand he rejoined him on 11th Shawwal of the following year.\r\n\r\n[620] So in text, but I.O. MSS. have kursi, 'a chair or stool' (l. 37).\r\n\r\n[621] Text budand, but Uda Ram is the only Dakhani officer mentioned.\r\n\r\n[622] The MSS. have zar-baft, 'gold brocade.'\r\n\r\n[623] In reference to his own name of Nuru-d-din.\r\n\r\n[624] Gharagi, 'unripeness.'\r\n\r\n[625] The Udaji Ram of Ma'asiru-l-umara, i, 142.\r\n\r\n[626] Jamkura is given in Forbes as the Dakhani word for a covering\r\nmade of reeds or palm-leaves and used in rainy weather.\r\n\r\n[627] The MS. has eight.\r\n\r\n[628] In the MSS. the name seems to be Hansomat (swan-like?).\r\n\r\n[629] Text has walida-i-khud, 'his own mother.'\r\n\r\n[630] A repetition.\r\n\r\n[631] The MSS. have 3 3/4 kos.\r\n\r\n[632] Text khata', 'fault,' but the MSS. show that the word is khatar,\r\n'danger.'\r\n\r\n[633] The passage is obscure, and the MSS. do not throw much light on\r\nit. Fortunately for the Mirza, there was no bullet in his gun. The word\r\nwhich I have translated by 'flexible' is rawan. Perhaps the meaning\r\nis quite different. Possibly it is \"he would fire a shot and then\r\nreload. As many of his bullets had been shot away, he put a pellet\r\n(ghalula) into his mouth and was shaping it,\" etc.\r\n\r\n[634] He has just spoken of Tuesday as the 15th! And as Jahangir did\r\nnot shoot on Sundays, Sunday must be a mistake for Wednesday. It is\r\nWednesday in I.O. MS. 305.\r\n\r\n[635] Perhaps bukra here means a male nilgaw; bukra means also\r\na he-goat.\r\n\r\n[636] This is the same kind of bird that Nur-Jahan is mentioned as\r\nhaving shot. Perhaps a green pigeon is meant.\r\n\r\n[637] Text nila, without the addition of gaw. The MSS. have gor or\r\nchor, a pheasant (?).\r\n\r\n[638] Elliot, vi, 352.\r\n\r\n[639] The 'two' is omitted in text.\r\n\r\n[640] In Sarkar Mandu (Jarrett, ii, 207) Debi Prasad's Hindi version\r\nhas Dakna.\r\n\r\n[641] The MSS. have \"more than 1,000.\" Raja Bhoj's date, according\r\nto Tod, is 567 A.D. (Jarrett, ii, 211).\r\n\r\n[642] This iron pillar is not now in existence at the mausoleum of\r\nAkbar (Note of Sayyid Ahmad). The pieces of the pillar are still\r\nlying at Dhar, outside the Lat Musjid (I.G., new ed., xi, 295).\r\n\r\n[643] The MSS. have 807, and this is correct, for Dilawar conquered\r\nMalwa in 803 = 1400.\r\n\r\n[644] Probably this means that `Amid was the son of Da'ud.\r\n\r\n[645] Text 70, but should be 7. 807 = 1405.\r\n\r\n[646] A son of Hushang. Muhammad Shah, intervened.\r\n\r\n[647] The MSS. have Jalot (as in the Hindi version).\r\n\r\n[648] Text, \"the parganah aforesaid.\" But the MSS. have Badnor. See\r\ninfra, p. 204 of text. (In this passage the Hindi version has Madlor.)\r\n\r\n[649] Blochmann, p. 502.\r\n\r\n[650] MSS. Bakor.\r\n\r\n[651] Dahut in MSS. But Dohad seems right, as it means two boundaries.\r\n\r\n[652] The dam was also used as a weight, and was equal to 5 tank or\r\n1 tola, 8 masha, 7 surkh (Blochmann, p. 31).\r\n\r\n[653] Apparently Sahra is the name of a town, and does not mean an\r\nopen space here.\r\n\r\n[654] Perhaps the line refers to the bee, and means that the bee\r\nwishes to suck the moisture of the flower.\r\n\r\n[655] The MSS. have gul-i-kul, 'the flower of the tank.' It seems to\r\nbe a water-lily.\r\n\r\n[656] Query \"the tank of Yasoda,\" the foster-mother of Krishna?\r\n\r\n[657] Blochmann, p. 252.\r\n\r\n[658] Jahangir crossed the Ghati Chand or Chand, between Ajmere\r\nand Malwa, in the 11th year (see p. 172), but he does not speak of\r\nhaving had any rohu fish there. Perhaps the reference is to his halt\r\nat Ramsar shortly before coming to Ghati Chand. He got 104 rohu at\r\nRamsar. See p. 169.\r\n\r\n[659] Elliot, vi, 353.\r\n\r\n[660] Mondah of Jarrett, ii, 253.\r\n\r\n[661] Text Nilao. No such parganah is mentioned in the Ayin; the two\r\nI.O. MSS. have Naryad.\r\n\r\n[662] Pitlad is mentioned in Bayley's Gujarat, p. 9, as having a very\r\nlarge revenue. It is the Patlad of Jarrett, ii, 253. Text wrongly\r\nhas Nilab. Possibly Bhil is the parganah meant.\r\n\r\n[663] Elliot, vi, 353.\r\n\r\n[664] The I.O. MSS. have Abhay or Abhi Kar.\r\n\r\n[665] Tiefenthaler, i, p. 380, etc., has an interesting notice of\r\nCambay. He also gives a sketch of its bay (plate xxxii).\r\n\r\n[666] Now so silted up that no tolerably large vessel can approach it.\r\n\r\n[667] Abu-l-fazl calls them tawari (Jarrett, ii, 241).\r\n\r\n[668] I.O. MSS. have 'ten.'\r\n\r\n[669] Tal tarang. Possibly tarang should read tarang (waves), and\r\nthe meaning be that Jahangir went to see the famous bore in the Gulf\r\nof Cambay.\r\n\r\n[670] See Elliot, vi, 355, and note.\r\n\r\n[671] In the text ahdi occurs by mistake instead of `ahdi, and man\r\ninstead of mas.\r\n\r\n[672] Wrongly so in text, but Jay Singh should be corrected to Raj\r\nSingh. The son of Jay Singh, Raja of Ajmir, was Ram Singh, who was\r\nborn in Sambat, 1692.\r\n\r\n[673] Or `Arabi (Arabian?).\r\n\r\n[674] Matar or Natar in I. O. MSS.\r\n\r\n[675] I. O. MS. 181 has \"in all the cities of Upper India.\"\r\n\r\n[676] The historian.\r\n\r\n[677] A saint of Multan who died in 1384. See Beale, s.v. Shaikh Jalal,\r\nand Jarrett, iii, 369.\r\n\r\n[678] So in text, but surely it should be \"8th or 7th\"? It appears\r\nfrom the Khazinatu-l-asfiya, ii, 71, that the attendant who lost the\r\nchild was a female disciple, and that the child was young.\r\n\r\n[679] According to Bayley's Gujarat, p. 238, and Index, p. 515,\r\nthe name is either Taj Khan Turpali or Narpali.\r\n\r\n[680] Suwari-i-khud u khwush-jalu-i-u, \"my own riding and his pleasant\r\npaces (?).\" It does not seem likely that Jahangir would himself drive\r\nthe elephant. The meaning here probably is that Jahangir trusted to\r\nhis being on the elephant. Khwush-jalu is used lower down about another\r\nelephant, and seems to refer to the elephant's paces. See p. 214.\r\n\r\n[681] Or doors. The Iqbal-nama, 108, has \"in front of each gate there\r\nis a bazar.\"\r\n\r\n[682] 123 in Iqbal-nama.\r\n\r\n[683] 350 in I.O. MSS.\r\n\r\n[684] Panjara-i-sang, presumably lattice-work in stone.\r\n\r\n[685] See for dimensions of the mosque Bayley's Gujarat, p. 92 and\r\nnote, and the authorities there quoted.\r\n\r\n[686] Text wrongly has Sunday.\r\n\r\n[687] Muhammad Ghaus was accused of heresy by some of the Gujarati\r\nmullas. He was much respected by Humayun, and is buried at Gwalior.\r\n\r\n[688] Jahangir means that Wajihu-d-din was a very learned man, and\r\nthat his devotion to Muhammad Ghaus, who was an ignorant man (ummi),\r\nshows what a great personality the latter was. Cf. Iqbal-nama, 169,\r\nand Ma'asiru-l-umara, ii, 583, where we are told that Wajihu-d-din\r\nthanked God that both his Prophet and his Pir were ignorant.\r\n\r\n[689] He wrote a history of Gujarat--the Mirat-i-Sikandari. Rieu,\r\nCat., i, 287.\r\n\r\n[690] Blochmann, 507, note.\r\n\r\n[691] \"Shaikh Ahmad Khattu, who had the title of Jamalu-d-din,\r\nwas born at Delhi of a noble family in 737 A.H. (1336-7). He was\r\nthe disciple and successor of Baba Ishaq (Isaac) Maghribi. His name\r\nwas Nasiru-d-din. By the jugglery of the heavens he was separated\r\nfrom his home in a storm, and after a while entered the service of\r\nBaba Ishaq. Maghribi. He acquired from him spiritual and secular\r\nlearning, and came to Gujarat in the time of Sultan Ahmad. High and\r\nlow accepted him, and paid him homage. Afterwards he travelled to\r\nArabia and Persia, and made the acquaintance of many saints. He is\r\nburied at Sarkhech, near Ahmadabad.\"--Ayin-i-Akbari (vol. ii, p. 220,\r\nof Bib. Ind., ed. Jarrett, iii, 371). See Bayley's Gujarat, p. 90,\r\nnote, and Khazinatu-l-asfiya, ii, 314, and Blochmann, 507, note, where\r\nthe reference to the Khazina, 957, seems wrong. The story told in the\r\nKhazina is that Shaikh Ahmad belonged to the royal family of Delhi,\r\nand was, as a baby, blown out of his nurse's arms into the street\r\nduring a storm.\r\n\r\n[692] Text khawanin, 'khans,' but evidently this is a mistake for\r\nkhawatin, the plural of khatun, 'a lady.'\r\n\r\n[693] I.O. MSS. have Sundar Sen.\r\n\r\n[694] See Elliot, vi, 355.\r\n\r\n[695] This name is doubtful, for the MSS. have a different reading,\r\napparently Namud. There is a Halod in Gujarat (Jarrett, ii, 242). See\r\nalso Bayley's Gujarat, 439. Perhaps it is the Halol of the Indian\r\nGazetteer.\r\n\r\n[696] The existence of this son of Baqi Tarkhan does not seem to\r\nhave been known to Abu-l-fazl or to Blochmann. Nor is he mentioned\r\nin the Ma'asiru-l-umara. See Jarrett, ii, 347, where only Payanda is\r\nspoken of as the son of Baqi Khan, and Blochmann, p. 362. See also\r\nMa'asiru-l-umara, iii, 485, the biography of Mirza `Isa Tarkhan. His\r\nname appears, however, in the pedigree of his house in the Tarkhan-nama\r\nof Jamal Shirazi.\r\n\r\n[697] The word sani in Sahib-qiran-i-sani in text is a mistake.\r\n\r\n[698] Shaqa'iq, which perhaps means tulips. In Price's Jahangir,\r\np. 115, there is much more said about the \"Garden of Victory,\"\r\nand Jahangir's entertainment there by his wife Khairu-n-nisa, the\r\ndaughter of the Khankhanan.\r\n\r\n[699] Bagina in text. Debi Prasad has Bakina.\r\n\r\n[700] Banoh in text. See Bayley's Gujarat, p. 237; also Tiefenthaler,\r\ni, 377, who speaks of it as being 3 leagues south of Ahmadabad. See\r\nalso Jarrett, ii, 240, n. 7.\r\n\r\n[701] For Sayyid Mubarak and his son see Bayley's Gujarat. Sayyid\r\nMubarak was the patron of the author of the Mirat-i-Sikandari. See\r\nloc. cit., p. 454.\r\n\r\n[702] It is the Chandsuma of Bayley's map.\r\n\r\n[703] Jarrett, iii, 210; and Akbar-nama, translation, i, 147, n. 2.\r\n\r\n[704] This should be Tapa. See Addenda.\r\n\r\n[705] I.O. MS., instead of khatimat-i-ahwal-u, has chunanchih ahwal,\r\n\"as has been stated in its place.\" This is probably correct, as\r\nJahangir has already referred to his death. See also the account of\r\nthe 2nd year, where he speaks of Ray Singh's going home without leave.\r\n\r\n[706] Perhaps an explanation of Zamakhshari's Commentary.\r\n\r\n[707] A Persian commentary on the Koran (Rieu, p. 96).\r\n\r\n[708] A life of Muhammad (Rieu, i, 147).\r\n\r\n[709] Dabhol (I.G., new ed., xi, 100).\r\n\r\n[710] Biyaz. The meaning is not clear. Perhaps what is meant is that\r\nthere was no writing, only the circles.\r\n\r\n[711] Elliot, vi, 356.\r\n\r\n[712] MSS. seem to have Manib.\r\n\r\n[713] MSS. seem to have Nimda.\r\n\r\n[714] The MSS. have Muhammad Husain Saudagar (trader).\r\n\r\n[715] The Jhallod of Bayley's map.\r\n\r\n[716] MSS. have Ranud.",
