Nor is its value purely\r\nhistorical. The \"Relación\" of Sancho gives much interesting ethnological\r\ninformation relative to the Inca dominion at the time of its demolition.\r\nErrors Pedro Sancho has in plenty; but the editor has striven to\r\ncounteract them by footnotes.\r\n\r\nIn every instance the translator has preserved Pedro Sancho's spelling\r\nof proper names, calling attention to the modern equivalent on the first\r\noccurrence of each name. In a few instances, where the text was\r\nunusually obscure, close translation has not been adhered to.\r\n\r\nThe virtues, as well as the shortcomings of this account, are so obvious\r\nthat an extended reference to them here is superfluous. It must always\r\nbe borne in mind that this document partook of the nature of an\r\n\"_apologia pro vita sua_\" and that it was directly inspired by Pizarro\r\nhimself with the purpose of restoring himself to the Emperor's favor.\r\nIts main purpose was to nullify whatever charges Pizarro's enemies may\r\nhave been making to the sovereign. Consequently there are numerous\r\nviolations of the truth, all of which are, for us, easy to recognize.\r\n\r\nA word as to the previous editions of Pedro Sancho may not be out of\r\nplace here. The original manuscript is lost. An Italian translation of\r\nit appears in the \"Viaggi\" of Giovanni Battista or Giambattista Ramusio,\r\npublished in Venice about 1550. The numerous editions of Ramusio's great\r\nwork do not need to be listed here. Occasionally the translator has\r\nreferred to that of 1563, a copy of which is in his possession. The\r\nedition which has served as a text for the present translation is that\r\nissued and edited by Don Joaquin García Icazbalceta, Mexico, 1849. This\r\nedition, like all of Icazbalceta's work, is painstaking. Professor\r\nMarshall Saville has been good enough to lend me his copy of this\r\nedition, which is very rare, in order that I might have it to work with.\r\nFinally, a small portion of Pedro Sancho's narrative was issued by the\r\nHakluyt Society of London. The editor, Sir Clements Markham, included it\r\nin the same volume with the reports of Xeres, Miguel de Estete, Hernando\r\nPizarro. The volume, entitled \"Reports on the Discovery of Peru,\" was\r\nissued by the Hakluyt Society in 1872.\r\n\r\n                                                  PHILIP AINSWORTH MEANS\r\n BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS\r\n    October 9, 1916\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATION\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the events that took place during the conquest and pacification of\r\nthese provinces of New Castile, and of the quality of the land, and of\r\nthe manner in which the Captain Hernando Pizarro afterward departed to\r\nbear to His Majesty the account of the victory of Caxamalca[1] and of\r\nthe capture of the Cacique Atabalipa.[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n    Concerning the great quantity of silver and gold which was brought\r\n    from Cuzco, and of the portion thereof which was sent to H. M. the\r\n    emperor as the royal fifth: How the imprisoned Cacique Atabalipa\r\n    declared himself free of his promise which he had made to the\r\n    Spaniards to fill a house with gold for ransom: And of the treason\r\n    which the said Atabalipa meditated against the Spaniards, for which\r\n    betrayal they made him die.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Captain Hernando Pizarro had departed with the hundred thousand\r\npesos of gold and the five thousand marks of silver which were sent to\r\nHis Majesty as his royal fifth; after that event, some ten or twelve\r\ndays, the two Spaniards who were bringing gold from Cuzco arrived, and\r\npart of the gold was melted at once because it was in very small pieces;\r\nit equalled the sum of[3] ... five hundred-odd plates of gold torn from\r\nsome house-walls in Cuzco; and even the smallest plates weighed four or\r\nfive pounds apiece; other, larger ones, weighed ten or twelve pounds,\r\nand with plates of this sort all the walls of that temple were covered.\r\nThey brought also a seat of very fine gold, worked into the form of a\r\nfoot-stool, which weighed eighteen thousand _pesos_.[4] Likewise, they\r\nbrought a fountain all of gold and very subtilely worked which was very\r\nfair to see as much for the skill of the work as for the shape which it\r\nhad been given; and there were many other pieces such as vases, jars,\r\nand plates which they also brought. All this gold gave a quantity which\r\ncame to two millions and a half [_pesos_], which, on being refined to\r\npure gold, came to one million, three hundred and twenty-odd thousand\r\npesos, from which was subtracted the fifth of His Majesty, or, two\r\nhundred and seventy-odd thousand pesos. Fifty thousand marks of silver\r\nwere found, of which ten thousand were set aside for H. M. One hundred\r\nand seventy thousand pesos and five thousand marks were handed over to\r\nthe treasurer of H. M. The remaining hundred thousand pesos and five\r\nmarks were taken, as has been said, by Hernando Pizarro to help meet\r\nthe expenses which His Caesarian Majesty was encountering in the war\r\nagainst the Turks, enemies of our Holy Faith, as they say. All that\r\nremained, beyond the royal fifth, was divided among the soldiers and\r\ncompanions of the Governor. He gave to each one what he conscientiously\r\nthought he justly merited, taking into consideration the trials each man\r\nhad passed through and the quality of his person, all of which he did\r\nwith the greatest diligence and speed possible in order that they might\r\nset out from that place and go to the city of Xauxa.[5]\r\n\r\nAnd because there were among those soldiers some who were old and more\r\nfit for rest than for fatigues, and who in that war had fought and\r\nserved much, he gave them leave to return to Spain. He procured their\r\ngood will so that, on returning, these men would give fairer accounts of\r\nthe greatness and wealth of that land so that a sufficient number of\r\npeople would come thither to populate and advance it. For, in truth,\r\nthe land being very large and very full of natives, the Spaniards who\r\nwere in it then were all too few for conquering it, holding it and\r\nsettling it, and, although they had already done great things in\r\nconquering it, it was owing more to the aid of God who, in every place\r\nand occasion, gave them the victory, than to any strength and means\r\nwhich they had for succeeding, with that further aid they were confident\r\nHe would sustain them in the future.\r\n\r\nThat melting of the metals completed, the Governor commanded the notary\r\nto draw up a document in which it said that the cacique Atabalipa was\r\nfree and absolved from the promise and word which he had given to the\r\nSpaniards, who were to take the house full of gold in ransom for\r\nhimself. This document the Governor caused to be proclaimed publicly and\r\nto the sound of trumpets in the plaza of that city of Caxamalca, making\r\nit known, at the same time, to the said Atabalipa by means of an\r\ninterpreter, and also he [the Governor] declared in the same\r\nproclamation, that, because it suited the service of H. M. and the\r\nsecurity of the land, he wished to maintain the cacique as a prisoner\r\nwith good guard, until more Spaniards should arrive who should give\r\nadded security; for, the cacique being free, he being so great a lord\r\nand having so many soldiers who feared and obeyed him, prisoner though\r\nhe was, and three hundred leagues [from his capital], he could not well\r\ndo less in order to free himself from all suspicion; all the more so\r\nbecause many times it had been thought almost certain that he had given\r\norders for warriors to assemble to attack the Spaniards. This, as a\r\nmatter of fact, had been ordered by him, and the men were all in\r\nreadiness with their captains, and the cacique only delayed the attack\r\nbecause of the lack of freedom in his own person and in that of his\r\ngeneral Chilichuchima,[6] who was also a prisoner. After some days had\r\npassed, and when the Spaniards were on the point of embarking in order\r\nto return to Spain, and the Governor was making the rest ready for\r\nsetting out for Xauxa, God Our Lord, who with his infinite goodness was\r\nguiding affairs toward all that was best for his service, as will be\r\n[seen], having already in this land Spaniards who were to inhabit it and\r\nbring to the knowledge of _the true God_ the natives of the said land so\r\nthat Our Lord might always be praised and known by these barbarians and\r\nso that his Holy Faith might be extolled, permitted the discovery and\r\nchastisement of the evil plans which this proud tyrant had in mind as a\r\nreturn for the many good works and kind treatment which he had always\r\nreceived from the governor and from each one of the Spaniards of his\r\ncompany; which recompense, according to his intention, was to have been\r\nof the sort he was wont to give to the caciques and lords of the land,\r\nordering [his men] to kill without let or cause whatever. For it chanced\r\nthat our discharged soldiers [were] returning to Spain, he, seeing that\r\nthey were taking with them the gold that had been got from his land,\r\nand mindful of the fact that but a short while ago he had been so great\r\na lord that he held all those provinces with their riches without\r\ndispute or question, and without considering the just causes for which\r\nthey had despoiled him of them, had given orders that certain troops\r\nwho, by his command, had been assembled in the land of Quito, should\r\ncome, on a certain night at an hour agreed upon, to attack the Spaniards\r\nwho were at Caxamalca, assaulting them from five directions as they were\r\nin their quarters, and setting fire wherever possible. Thirty or more\r\nSpanish soldiers were marching outside of Caxamalca, having been to the\r\ncity of San Miguel in order to place the gold for H. M. on board ship,\r\nand [the Inca] believed that as they were so few he would be able easily\r\nto kill them before they could join forces with those in Caxamalca[7]\r\n... of which there was much information from many caciques and from\r\ntheir chiefs themselves, that all, without fear of torments or menaces,\r\nvoluntarily confessed this plot: [telling] how fifty thousand men of\r\nQuito and many Caribes[8] came to the land, and that all the confines\r\ncontained armed men in great numbers; that, not finding supplies for\r\nthem all thus united, he had divided them into three or four divisions,\r\nand that, though scattered in this fashion, there were still so many\r\nthat not finding enough to sustain themselves, they had cut down the\r\nstill green maize and dried it so that they might not lack for food. All\r\nthis having been learned, and being now a public matter to all, and as\r\nit was clear that they were saying in his [the Inca's] army that they\r\nwere coming to kill all the Christians, and the governor seeing in how\r\nmuch peril the government and all the Spaniards were, in order to\r\nfurnish a remedy, although it grieved him much, nevertheless, after\r\nseeing the information and process drawn up, assembled the officials of\r\nH. M. and the captains of his company and a Doctor who was then in this\r\narmy, and the padre Fray Vicente de Valverde, a religious of the order\r\nof Santo Domingo sent by the Emperor our Lord for the conversion and\r\ninstruction of the people of these realms; after there had been much\r\ndebate and discussion over the harm and the profit that might follow\r\nupon the continued life or the death of Atabalipa, it was resolved that\r\njustice should be done upon him. And because the officials of H. M.\r\nasked for it and the doctor regarded the information as sufficient, he\r\nwas finally taken from the prison in which he was, and, to the sound of\r\na trumpet, his treason and perfidy were published, and he was borne to\r\nthe middle of the plaza of the city and tied to a stake, while the\r\nreligious was consoling him and teaching him, by means of an\r\ninterpreter, the things of our christian faith, telling him that God\r\nwished him to die for the sins which he had committed in the world, and\r\nthat he must repent of them, and that God would pardon him if he did so\r\nand was baptised at once. He, [the Inca] moved by this discourse, asked\r\nfor baptism. It was at once given to him by that reverend padre who\r\naided him so much with his exhortation that although he was sentenced to\r\nbe burned alive, he was given a twist of rope around his neck, by means\r\nof which he was throttled instead[9] but when he saw that they were\r\npreparing for his death, he said that he recommended to the governor his\r\nlittle sons, so that he might take them with him, and with these last\r\nwords, and while the Spaniards who stood around him said the creed for\r\nhis soul, he was quickly throttled. May God take him to his holy glory,\r\nfor he died repentant of his sins with the true faith of a Christian.\r\nAfter he was thus hung, in fulfilment of the sentence, fire was cast\r\nupon him so that a part of his clothes and flesh was burnt. That night\r\n[because he had died in the late afternoon] his body remained in the\r\nplaza in order that all might learn of his death, and on the next day\r\nthe Governor ordered that all the Spaniards should be present at his\r\ninterment, and, with the cross and other religious paraphernalia, he\r\nwas borne to the church and buried with as much solemnity as if he had\r\nbeen the chief Spaniard of our camp. Because of this all the principal\r\nlords and caciques who served him received great pleasure, considering\r\nas great the honour which was done them, and knowing that, because he\r\nwas a christian, he was not burned alive, and he was interred in church\r\nas if he were a Spaniard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n    They choose as lord of the state of Atabalipa his brother\r\n    Atabalipa[10] in whose coronation they observed ceremonies in\r\n    accordance with the usage of the caciques of those provinces. Of the\r\n    vassalage and obedience which Atabalipa and many other caciques\r\n    offered to the Emperor.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis done, the governor commanded the immediate assembling in the chief\r\nplaza of that city of all the caciques and principal lords who were then\r\nliving there in company with the dead lord; they were many, and from\r\ndistant lands, and his intention was to give them another lord who\r\nshould govern them in the name of H. M., for, as they were accustomed to\r\ngive always their obedience and tribute to a sole lord, great confusion\r\nwould result if it were not thus, for each of them would rise up with\r\nhis own lordship, and it would cost much toil to bring them into\r\nfriendship with the Spaniards and into the service of H. M. For this and\r\nmany other reasons the Governor made them assemble, and finding among\r\nthem a son of Gucunacaba[11] called Atabalipa, a brother of Atabalipa to\r\nwhom by law the realm belonged, he said to all that now that they saw\r\nhow Atabalipa was dead because of the treason he had plotted against him\r\n[the Governor], and because they were all left without a lord who should\r\ngovern them and whom they should obey, he wished to give them a lord who\r\nwould please them all, and that he [the lord] was Atabalipa who was\r\nthere present, to whom that kingdom legitimately belonged as he was the\r\nson of that Gucunacaba whom they had loved so much. He [Atabalipa] was a\r\nyoung man who would treat them with much love and who had enough\r\nprudence to govern that land. He [the Governor] urged them,\r\nnevertheless, to look well to it that they wished him for a lord, for if\r\nnot, they were to name another, and if he were capable, the governor\r\nwould give him to them as lord. They replied that since Atabalipa was\r\ndead, they would obey Atabalipa or whomever else he should give them,\r\nand so it was arranged that they should yield obedience another day\r\naccording to the accustomed manner. When the next day had come, once\r\nmore they all assembled before the door of the governor where was placed\r\nthe cacique in his chair and near him all the other lords and chiefs,\r\neach in his proper position. And due ceremonies having been held, each\r\none came to offer him a white plume as a sign of vassalage and tribute,\r\nwhich is an ancient custom dating from the time that this land was\r\nconquered by these Cuzcos.[12] This done, they sang and danced, making a\r\ngreat festivity, in which the new king neither arrayed himself in\r\nclothes of price nor placed the fringe upon the forehead in the manner\r\nin which the dead lord was wont to wear it. And when the governor asked\r\nhim why he did so, he replied that it was the custom of his ancestors\r\nwhen they took possession of the realm to mourn the dead cacique and to\r\npass three days in fasting, shut up within their house, after which they\r\nused to come forth with much pomp and solemnity and hold great\r\nfestivities, for which reason he, too, would like to spend two days in\r\nfasting. The Governor replied that since it was an ancient custom he\r\nmight keep it, and that soon he would give him many things which the\r\nEmperor our Lord sent to him, which he would give to him and to all the\r\nlords of those provinces. And at once the cacique was placed for his\r\nfast in a place apart from the assembly of the others, which was a house\r\nthat they had built for this purpose since the day that notice was given\r\nby the Governor; it was near the Governor's lodging; on account of it\r\nthe said Governor and the other Spaniards were greatly astonished,\r\nseeing how, in so short a time, so large and fine a house had been\r\nbuilt. In it he was shut up and retired without anyone's seeing him or\r\nentering that place save the servants who waited on him and brought him\r\nfood, or the Governor when he wished to send him something. When the\r\nfast was over, he came forth richly clad and accompanied by many troops,\r\ncaciques and chiefs who guarded him, and all the places where he was to\r\nsit were adorned with costly cushions, and beneath his feet were placed\r\nfine cloths. Seated near him was Calichuchima, the great general of\r\nAtabalipa who conquered this land, as was told in the account of the\r\naffairs at Caxamalca, and near him was also the captain Tice, one of the\r\nchiefs, and on the other side were certain brothers of the lord, while\r\non both hands were other caciques and captains and governors of\r\nprovinces and other lords of great lands, and, in short, no one sat\r\nthere who was not of quality. They all ate together on the ground, for\r\nthey use no other table, and when they had eaten, the cacique said that\r\nhe wished to give his obedience in the name of H. M., as his chiefs had\r\ngiven it. The Governor told him to do it in the way that seemed best,\r\nand soon he [the cacique] offered him [the governor] a white plume\r\nwhich had been given to him by his caciques, saying that it was given as\r\na token of obedience. The Governor embraced him with much love and\r\nreceived it, saying that he wished to tell him the things which he was\r\nto tell in the name of the Emperor, and it was agreed between the two\r\nthat they should meet again for this purpose the following day. When it\r\nhad arrived, the Governor presented himself in the assembly dressed as\r\nwell as possible in silken clothes and accompanied by the officials of\r\nH. M. and by some noblemen of his company who assisted well-dressed for\r\nthe greater solemnity of this ceremony of friendship and peace, and by\r\nhis side he stationed the ensign with the royal standard. Then the\r\nGovernor began asking each [cacique] in turn his name and that of the\r\nland of which he was the lord, and he ordered that it be taken down by\r\nhis secretary and scrivener, and there were as many as fifty caciques\r\nand chiefs. Then, facing all those people, he told them that D. Carlos\r\nour lord of whom they were servants and vassals who were in his\r\ncompany, had sent him to that land in order to give them understanding\r\nand to preach to them of how a sole Lord Creator of the sky and of the\r\nearth, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, three distinct persons in one sole\r\ntrue God, had created them and given them life and being, and had\r\nbrought to bear the fruits of the land whereby they were sustained, and\r\nthat to this end he would teach them what they were to do and observe in\r\norder to be saved. And he told them how, by the command of the\r\nall-powerful God, and of his vicars upon earth, because he had gone to\r\nheaven where he now dwells and will be eternally glorified, those lands\r\nwere given to the Emperor in order that he might have charge of them,\r\nwho had sent him [Pizarro] to instruct them in the christian faith and\r\nplace them under his obedience. He added that it was all in writing and\r\nthat they should listen to it and fulfil that which he had read to them,\r\nby means of an interpreter, word for word. Then he asked them if they\r\nhad understood, and they replied that they had, and that since he had\r\ngiven them Atabalipa for a lord, they would do all that he commanded\r\nthem to do in the name of H. M., holding as supreme lord the Emperor,\r\nthen the Governor, then Atabalipa, in order to do as much as he\r\ncommanded in his [H. M.'s] name. Then the Governor took in his hands the\r\nroyal standard which he raised on high three times, and he told them\r\nthat, as vassals of the Caesarian Majesty, they ought to do likewise,\r\nand the cacique took it, and afterwards the captains and the other\r\nchiefs, and each one raised it aloft twice; then they went to embrace\r\nthe Governor who received them with great joy through seeing their good\r\nwill, and with how much contentment they had heard the affairs of God\r\nand of our religion. The Governor wished that all this be drawn up as\r\ntestimony in writing, and when it was over, the caciques and chiefs held\r\ngreat festivities, so much so that every day there were rejoicings such\r\nas games and feasts, usually held in the house of the Governor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n    While leading a new colony of Spaniards to settle in Xauxa, they\r\n    receive news of the death of Guaritico,[13] brother of Atahualpa.\r\n    Afterwards they passed through the land of Guamachucho,[14]\r\n    Adalmach,[15] Guaiglia,[16] Puerto Nevado, and Capo Tombo,[17] and\r\n    they hear that in Tarma many Indian warriors are waiting to attack\r\n    them, on account of which they take Calichuchima prisoner, and then\r\n    proceed intrepidly on their journey to Cachamarca,[18] where they\r\n    find much gold.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time he [the Governor] had just finished distributing the gold\r\nand silver which were in that house among the Spaniards of his company,\r\nand Atabalipa gave the gold belonging to the royal fifths to the\r\ntreasurer of H. M. who took charge of it in order to carry it to the\r\ncity of Xauxa where he [the Governor] intended to found a colony of\r\nSpaniards on account of the reports he had of the good surrounding\r\nprovinces and of the many cities which there were about it. To this\r\nend, he had the Spaniards arranged in order and provided with arms and\r\nother things for the journey, and when the time for departure came, he\r\ngave them Indians to carry their gold and burdens. Before setting out,\r\nhaving heard how few soldiers there were in San Miguel[19] for the\r\npurpose of holding it, he took, from among those Spaniards whom he was\r\nto take with him, ten cavalrymen and a captain, a person of great\r\ncautiousness, whom he ordered to go to that city where he was to\r\nmaintain himself until ships should arrive with troops who might guard\r\nit, after which he was to go to Xauxa where he himself was about to\r\nfound a village of Spaniards and melt the gold which he bore, promising\r\nthat he would give them all the gold that was due them with as much\r\npunctuality as if they were actually present, because his [the\r\ncaptain's] return [to San Miguel] was very necessary, that being the\r\nfirst city to be settled and colonized for the Caesarian Majesty as\r\nwell as the chief one because in it they would have to wait there to\r\nreceive the ships which should come from Spain, to that land.[20]\r\n\r\nIn this manner they set out with the instructions which the Governor\r\ngave them as to what they were to do in the pacification of the people\r\nof that region. The Governor set out one Monday morning, and on that day\r\ntravelled three leagues, sleeping by the shore of a river where the news\r\nreached him that a brother of Atabalipa called Guaritico had been killed\r\nby some captains of Atabalipa at his command. This Guaritico was a very\r\nimportant person and a friend of the Spaniards, and he had been sent by\r\nthe Governor from Caxamalca to repair the bridges and bad spots in the\r\nroad. The cacique pretended to feel great heaviness because of his\r\ndeath, and the Governor himself regretted it because he liked him, and\r\nbecause he was very useful to the Christians. The next day the Governor\r\nset out from that place, and, by his marches, arrived in the land of\r\nGuamachucho, eighteen leagues from Caxamalca. Having rested there two\r\ndays, he set out for Caxamalca[21] nine leagues ahead, and arrived there\r\nin three days, and rested four in order that his troops might have\r\nrepose and opportunity to collect supplies for the march to Guaiglia,\r\ntwenty leagues from there. Having left this village, he came in three\r\ndays to the Puerto de Nevado, and a morning's march brought him within a\r\nday's journey of Guaiglia; and the governor commanded a captain of his,\r\nwho was the Marshal D. Diego de Almagro, to go with troops and take a\r\nbridge two leagues from Guaiglia, which bridge was built in a manner\r\nthat will soon be related. This captain captured the bridge, which is\r\nnear a strong mountain that dominated that land. The Governor did not\r\ndelay in arriving at the bridge with the rest of his men, and having\r\ncrossed it, he went on, in another morning, which was Sunday, to\r\nGuaiglia. Arrived there, they soon heard mass and afterwards entered\r\ncertain good rooms; having rested there eight days, he set forth with\r\nthe soldiers, and the next day crossed another bridge of osiers,[22]\r\nwhich was above the said river which here passes through a very\r\ndelectable valley. They journeyed thirty leagues to the point where\r\ncaptain Hernando Pizarro came when he went to Pachacamac,[23] as will be\r\nseen in the long account which was sent to H. M. of all that was done on\r\nthat journey to Pachacamac, from there to the city of Xauxa and back to\r\nCaxamalca, on the occasion on which he took with him the captain\r\nChilichuchima and other matters which do not concern us here. The\r\nGovernor changed his route, and, by forced marches, arrived at the land\r\nof Caxatambo.[24] From there he went on without doing more than to ask\r\nfor some Indians who should carry the gold of H. M. and of the soldiers,\r\nand always using great vigilance in learning of the affairs which took\r\nplace in the land, and always having both a vanguard and a rear-guard as\r\nhad been done up to that time for fear that the captain Chilichuchima\r\nwhom he had with him, would hatch some treasonable plot, all the more so\r\non account of the suspicion he felt owing to the fact that neither in\r\nCaxatambo nor in the eighteen leagues after it had he met with any\r\nwarriors, nor were his fears lessened during a halt in a village five\r\nleagues beyond because all the people had fled without leaving a living\r\nsoul. When he had arrived there, a Spaniard's Indian servant, who was\r\nfrom that land of Pambo[25] distant from here some ten leagues, and\r\ntwenty from Xauxa, came to him saying that he had heard that troops had\r\nbeen assembled in Xauxa to kill the Christians who were coming, and that\r\nthey had as captains Incorabaliba, Iguaparro, Mortay[26] and another\r\ncaptain, all four being important men who had many troops with them, and\r\nthe servant added that they had placed a part of this force in a village\r\ncalled Tarma five leagues from Xauxa in order to guard a bad pass that\r\nthere was in a mountain and to cut and break it up in such a way that\r\nthe Spaniards could not pass by. Informed of this, the governor gave\r\norders that Chilichuchima should be made a prisoner, because it was held\r\nto be certain that that force had been made ready by his advice and\r\ncommand, he thinking to flee the Christians and to go to join it. Of\r\nthese matters the cacique Atabalipa was unaware, and on this account,\r\nthese [Spanish] troops did not permit any Indian to pass by in the\r\ndirection of the cacique who might give notice of these affairs. The\r\nreason why these Indians had rebelled and were seeking war with the\r\nChristians was that they saw the land being conquered by the Spaniards,\r\nand they themselves wished to govern it.\r\n\r\nThe Governor, before setting out from that place, sent a captain with\r\ntroops to take a snowy pass three leagues ahead and then to pass the\r\nnight in some fields near Pombo,[27] all of which the captain did, and\r\nhe passed the pass with much snow, but without encountering any\r\nobstacle. And the Governor crossed it likewise, without any opposition\r\nsave for the inconvenience caused by the snow falling upon them. They\r\nall spent the night in that waste without a single hut, and they lacked\r\nfor wood and victuals. Having arrived in the land of Pombo, the Governor\r\nprovided and commanded that the soldiers should be lodged with the best\r\norder and caution possible, because he had news that the enemy were\r\nincreasing every moment, and it was held to be certain that he would\r\ncome here to assail the Spaniards, and because of this, the Governor\r\ncaused the patrols and sentinels to be increased, always spying upon the\r\nprogress of the enemy. After he had waited there another day for certain\r\nenvoys whom the cacique Atabalipa had sent to learn what was going on in\r\nXauxa, one came who told how the warriors were five leagues from Xauxa\r\non the road from Cuzco and were coming to burn the town so that the\r\nChristians should not find shelter, and that they intended afterward to\r\nreturn to Cuzco to combine under a captain named Quizquiz who was there\r\nwith many troops who had come from Quito by command of Atabalipa for\r\nthe security of the land. When this was learned by the Governor, he\r\ncaused to be made ready seventy-five light horse, and with twenty peones\r\nwho guarded Chilichuchima, and without the impediment of baggage, he set\r\nout for Xauxa, leaving behind the treasurer with the other troops who\r\nwere guarding the camp baggage and the gold of H. M., and of the\r\ncompany. The day on which he set out from Pombo, he travelled some seven\r\nleagues, and he halted in a village called Cacamarca,[28] and here they\r\nfound seventy thousand pesos of gold in large pieces, to guard which the\r\nGovernor left two Christians from the cavalry in order that when the\r\nrear-guard should arrive, it might be conducted well guarded. Then, in\r\nthe morning, he set forth with his men in good array, for he had word\r\nthat three leagues from there were four thousand men. And on the march\r\nthree or four light horsemen went ahead so that, if they should meet a\r\nspy of the enemy's, they might take him prisoner to prevent his giving\r\nwarning of their coming. At the hour of noon, they arrived at that bad\r\npass of Tarma where warriors were said to be waiting to defend it. The\r\npass seemed to be so full of difficulties that it would be impossible to\r\ngo up it, because there was a bad road of stone down into the gully\r\nwhere all the riders had to dismount, after which it was necessary to go\r\nup the heights by a slope about a league long, the greater part of which\r\nwas steep and difficult forest, all of which was crossed without any\r\nIndians who were said to be armed making an appearance. And in the\r\nafternoon, after the hour of vespers, the Governor and his men arrived\r\nat that village of Tarma where, because it was a bad site and because he\r\nhad news that Indians were coming to it to surprise the Christians, he\r\ndid not wish to linger longer than was necessary for feeding the horses\r\nand allaying their own hunger and fatigue so as to enable them to go\r\nforth prepared from that place which had no other level spot than the\r\nplaza as it was on a small slope surrounded by mountains for the space\r\nof a league. As it was already night, he made his camp here, being\r\nalways on the alert and having the horses saddled. And the men were\r\nwithout [proper] food and even without any comfort because there was\r\nneither fire-wood nor water, nor had they brought their tents with them\r\nto shelter them, because of which they all nearly died of cold on\r\naccount of the fact that it rained much early in the night and then\r\nsnowed so that the arms and clothes were drenched. But each one sought\r\nthe best remedy he could, and so that evil and troublous night passed to\r\nthe dawn when he commanded that all mount their horses so as to arrive\r\nearly at Xauxa which was four leagues from there. When two had been\r\ncrossed over, the Governor divided the seventy-five soldiers between\r\nthree captains, giving fifteen to each, and taking with him the\r\nremaining twenty and the twenty peones who were guarding Chilichuchima.\r\nIn this order they journeyed to Porsi a league from Xauxa, having given\r\neach captain orders as to what he was to do, and they all halted in a\r\nsmall village which they encountered. Then they all marched on in\r\ncomplete accord, and gave a look at the city. They all halted again on a\r\nslope within a quarter of a league of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n    They arrive at the city of Xauxa; they leave some soldiers there to\r\n    guard that place, and others go against the army of the enemy with\r\n    which they fight. They win a victory, and return to Xauxa.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe natives all came out along the road in order to look at the\r\nChristians, celebrating much their coming because they thought that,\r\nthrough it, they would issue forth from the slavery in which that\r\nforeign army [the Incas] held them. [The Spaniards] wished to await a\r\nlater hour in the day at this place, but, seeing that no warriors\r\nappeared, they began their journey so as to enter the city. On going\r\ndown that little slope, they saw running toward them at great speed an\r\nIndian with a lance erect, and when he came up to them it was found that\r\nhe was a servant of the Christians who said that his master had sent\r\nhim to inform them that they must hold themselves in readiness because\r\ntheir enemies were in the city, and that two Christians from the cavalry\r\nhad been sent ahead of the rest, and that they had entered the city to\r\nsee the buildings there, and while they were inspecting it, they saw\r\nsome twenty Indians who came out of certain houses with their lances and\r\nother arms, calling to others to come forth and join with them. The two\r\nChristians, seeing them thus assemble, without heeding their cries and\r\nclamour, attacked them, killed several, and put the others to flight;\r\nthe latter soon joined with others who came to their aid, and they\r\nformed a mass of some two hundred which the Spaniards again attacked, in\r\na narrow street, and broke, forcing them to retreat to the bank of a\r\ngreat river which passes by that city, and then one of these Spaniards\r\nsent the Indian as I have said, with raised lance as a sign that there\r\nwere armed enemies in the city. This having been heard, the Spaniards\r\nset spur to their horses, and, without delay, arrived at the city and\r\nentered it; and when they joined their companions, the latter told them\r\nwhat had occurred with those Indians. The captains, running in the\r\ndirection in which the enemy had retreated, arrived at length at the\r\nbank of the river, which was then very full, and on the other shore, at\r\na distance of a quarter of a league, they descried the squadrons of\r\ntheir enemies. Then, having passed the river with no little toil and\r\ndanger, they gave chase to them. The Governor remained guarding the city\r\nbecause it was said that there were enemies hidden within it, as well.\r\nThe Indians perceiving that the Christians had crossed the river, they\r\nbegan to retreat, drawn up in two squadrons. One of the Spanish\r\ncaptains, with his fifteen light horsemen, spurred ahead toward the\r\nslope of the hill for which they [the Indians] were making so that they\r\ncould not retreat thither and fortify themselves. The other two captains\r\nkept right up with them, overtaking them in a field of maize near the\r\nriver. There they put them in disorder and routed them, capturing as\r\nmany as possible, so that of six hundred [Indians] not more than twenty\r\nor thirty, who took to the mountains before the other captain with his\r\nfifteen men could arrive, saved themselves. Most of the Indians made for\r\nthe water, thinking to save themselves in it, but the light horsemen\r\ncrossed the river almost by swimming after them, and they did not leave\r\none alive save some few who had hidden themselves in their flight after\r\ntheir army was broken in pieces. Then the Spaniards ran through the\r\ncountry as far as a league below without finding a single Indian. Then,\r\nhaving returned, they rested themselves and their horses, which were in\r\ngreat need of it; both because of the long journey of the day before and\r\non account of their having run those two leagues, they were rather\r\ncrippled. When the truth was learned as to what troops those were [with\r\nwhom the Spaniards had fought], it was found that the four captains and\r\nthe main body were encamped six leagues down the river from Xauxa, and\r\nthat, on that very day, they had sent those six hundred men to complete\r\nthe burning of the city of Xauxa, having already burned the other half\r\nof it seven or eight days before, and that they had then burned a great\r\nedifice which was in the plaza, as well as many other things before the\r\neyes of the people of that city, together with many clothes and much\r\nmaize, so that the Spaniards should not avail themselves of them. The\r\ncitizens were left so hostile to those other Indians that if one of the\r\nlatter hid, they showed him to the Christians so that they would kill\r\nhim, and they themselves aided in killing them, and they would even have\r\ndone so with their own hands if the Christians had permitted it. The\r\nSpanish captains, having studied the place where these enemies were\r\nfound as well as the road, along a part of which they journeyed, they\r\ndetermined not to shut themselves up in Xauxa, but to pass onward and\r\nattack the main body of the army which was four leagues off before it\r\nshould receive news of their coming. With this intention, they\r\ncommanded the soldiers to make ready, but their proposal did not come to\r\npass because they found the horses so weary that they held it to be\r\nbetter council to retire, which they did. Arrived in Xauxa, they\r\nrecounted to the Governor all that had happened, with which he was well\r\npleased, and he received them cheerfully, thanking them all for having\r\nborne themselves so valorously. And he told them that by all means he\r\nintended to attack the camp of the enemy because, although they were\r\nadvised of the victory, it was certain that they would be waiting. At\r\nonce he ordered his master of the camp to lodge the men and let them\r\nrest during what remained of the day and through the night until\r\nmoon-rise, and that then they should make ready to go and attack their\r\nenemies. At that hour fifty light horsemen were in readiness, and at the\r\nsound of the trumpet they presented themselves, armed and with their\r\nhorses, at the lodging of the Governor who despatched them very soon\r\nupon their road. Fifteen horsemen remained with him in the city\r\ntogether with the twenty peones who made the guard all of each night\r\nwith the horses saddled, until the captain of that sally returned, which\r\nwas in five days. He related to the governor all that had happened from\r\nthe time of his departure, telling how, on the night he left Xauxa, he\r\njourneyed some four leagues before dawn, with much eagerness to attack\r\nthe enemy's camp before they were warned of his coming; and being now\r\nnear [the enemy] at dawn, they saw a great mass of smoke in the place of\r\ntheir encampment, which seemed to be two leagues further on. And so he\r\nspurred on with his men at a great pace, thinking that the enemy, warned\r\nof his approach, had fled and that the buildings that there were in a\r\nvillage were burning. And so it was, because they had fled, after having\r\nset fire to that wretched hamlet. Arrived at that place, the Spaniards\r\nfollowed the footsteps of the warriors through a very broad valley. And\r\nas they overtook them they collided with the enemy who were going more\r\nslowly with many women and children in their rear-guard, and the\r\nSpaniards, leaving these behind them in order to catch up with the men,\r\nran more than four leagues, and caught up with some of their squadrons.\r\nAs some of them [the Indians] saw the Castilians from some distance,\r\nthey had time to take shelter on a mountain and save themselves; others,\r\nwho were few, were killed, leaving in the power of the Spaniards (who,\r\nbecause their horses were tired, did not wish to go up the mountain)\r\nmany spoils and women and children. And as it was already night, they\r\nreturned to sleep in a village which they had left behind. And the\r\nfollowing day these Spaniards determined to follow them as they fled\r\nback to Cuzco so as to take from them certain bridges of net-work and to\r\nprevent their crossing. But, because of lack of pasturage for their\r\nhorses, they found themselves obliged to fall back, to the\r\ndissatisfaction of the Governor because they had not at least followed\r\nand taken those bridges so as to prevent the Indians from returning to\r\nCuzco; it was feared that, being strange people, they would do great\r\nharm to the citizens of those places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n    They name new officials in the city of Xauxa in order to establish a\r\n    settlement of Spaniards, and, having had news of the death of\r\n    Atabalipa, with great prudence and much craftiness in order to keep\r\n    themselves in the good graces of the Indians, they discuss the\r\n    appointment of a new lord.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd for this reason, as soon as the baggage and the rear-guard, which he\r\nhad left at Pombo, had arrived, he [the Governor] published an edict to\r\nthe effect that whereas he was determined to found a settlement of\r\nSpaniards in the name of H. M., all those who wished to settle there\r\nmight do so. But there was not one Spaniard who wished to remain, and\r\nthey said that so long as there were warriors all about in that land\r\nwith arms in their hands the natives of that province would not be at\r\nthe service and disposal of the Spaniards and in obedience to H. M. When\r\nthis was observed by the Governor, he determined not to lose time then\r\nin that matter, but to go against the enemy in the direction of Cuzco in\r\norder to drive them from that province and rout them from all of it. In\r\nthe meanwhile, in order to put in order the affairs of that city, he\r\nfounded the village in the name of H. M., and created officials of\r\njustice for it [and for its citizens] who were eighty in number, of whom\r\nforty were light horsemen whom he left there as a garrison, and,\r\n[leaving also] the treasurer, who was to guard the gold of H. M. and to\r\nact in all matters as head and chief in command of the government.[29]\r\nWhile these things were being done, the cacique Atabalipa came to die,\r\nof his illness; because of this, the Governor and all the other\r\nSpaniards felt great sorrow, because it was certain that he was very\r\nprudent and had much love for the Spaniards. It was given out publicly\r\nthat the captain Calichuchima had caused his death because he desired\r\nthat the land should remain with the people of Quito and not with either\r\nthose of Cuzco or with the Spaniards, and if that cacique [\"Atabalipa\"]\r\nhad lived, he [Calichuchima] would not have been able to succeed in what\r\nhe desired to do. At once, the Governor had Calichuchima and Tizas[30]\r\nand a brother of the cacique and other leading chiefs and caciques who\r\nhad come from Caxamalca summoned to him; to them he said that they must\r\nknow very well that he had given them Atabalipa as a lord and that, now\r\nthat he was dead, they ought to think of whom they would like as lord in\r\norder that he might give him to them. There was a great difference of\r\nopinion between them on this subject because Calichuchima wished the son\r\nof Atabalipa and brother of the dead cacique Aticoc[31] as lord, and\r\nothers, who were not of the land of Quito, wished the lord to be a\r\nnative of Cuzco and proposed a brother of Atabalipa (as lord). The\r\nGovernor said to those who wished as lord the brother of Atabalipa that\r\nthey should send and have him summoned and that after he had come, if he\r\nfound him to be a man of worth, he would appoint him. And with this\r\nreply that meeting came to an end. And the Governor, having called aside\r\nthe captain Calichuchima, spoke to him in these words: \"You already know\r\nthat I loved greatly your lord Atabalipa and that I have always wished\r\nhim to leave a son after he died, and that this son should be lord, and\r\nthat you, who are already a prudent man, should be his captain until he\r\nhad reached the age of governing his dominions, and for this reason I\r\ngreatly desire that he should be called soon, because, for love of his\r\nfather, I love him much, and you likewise. But at the same time, since\r\nall these caciques who are here are your friends and since you have much\r\ninfluence with the soldiers of their nation, it would be well that you\r\nsend them word by messengers to come in peace, because I do not wish to\r\nbe enraged against them and to kill them, as you see I am doing, when I\r\nwish that the affairs of these provinces should be quiet and peaceful.\"\r\nThis captain had a great desire, as has been said, that the son of\r\nAtabalipa should be lord, and knowing this, the Governor slyly spoke\r\nthese words to him and gave him this hope, not because he had any\r\nintention of carrying it out,[32] but in order that, in the meanwhile,\r\nthat son of Atabalipa might come for this purpose (and) might cause\r\nthose caciques who had taken up arms [also] to come to him in peace. It\r\nwas likewise agreed that he should say to Aticoc and to the other lords\r\nof the province of Cuzco that he [the Governor] would give them as lord\r\nhim whom they wished, because it was necessary that those things which\r\nwere for the good of all should thus be governed in the state. He tried\r\nto give to Calichuchima words that [would enable him] to cause the\r\npeople who were in Cuzco with arms to lay them down in order that they\r\nmight do no harm to the people of the country, and those of Cuzco,\r\nbecause they were true friends of the Christians, gave them notice of\r\nall that the enemy were trying to do and of all that was going on in the\r\ncountry, and for this reason and others the Governor said this with\r\ngreat prudence. Chilichuchima, to whom he told it, showed as much\r\npleasure at these words as if he had been made lord of the whole world,\r\nand he replied that he would do as he was ordered and that it would\r\ncause him much pleasure if the caciques and soldiers were to come in\r\npeace[33] and that he would despatch messengers to Quito in order that\r\nthe son of Atabalipa might come. But he feared that two great captains\r\nwho were with him would prevent it, and would not let him come.\r\nNevertheless he would send such a person of importance with the embassy\r\nthat he thought that all would conform with his wish. And soon he added,\r\n\"Sir, since you wish me to cause these caciques to come, take off this\r\nchain [which I wear] for, seeing me with it, no one wishes to obey me.\"\r\nThe Governor, in order that he should not suspect that he had feigned\r\nwhat he had said to him, told him that he was pleased to do so, but on\r\nthe condition that he was to put a guard of Christians over him until\r\nafter he had caused those soldiers who were at war to come in peace and\r\nuntil the son of Atabalipa had come.[34] He [Chalcuchima] was satisfied\r\nwith this, and so he was released, and the Governor put him under a good\r\nguard, because that captain was the key [the possession of which\r\nensured] having the land quiet and subjected. This precaution taken, and\r\nthe troops who were to go with the Governor toward Cuzco being made\r\nready, the number of whom was one hundred horsemen and thirty peons, he\r\n[the Governor] ordered a captain to go ahead with seventy horsemen and\r\nsome peons in order to rebuild the bridges which had been burned, and\r\nthe Governor remained behind while he was giving orders for many matters\r\ntouching the welfare of the city and Republic which he was to leave\r\nalready well established, and in order to await the reply of the\r\nChristians whom he had sent to the coast in order to examine the ports\r\nand set up crosses in them in case some one should come to reconnoitre\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n    Description of the bridges which the natives are wont to make in\r\n    order to cross the rivers; and of the toilsome journey which the\r\n    Spaniards had, in going to Cuzco, and of the arrival at Panarai and\r\n    Tarcos.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis captain departed with those who were to follow him on Thursday, and\r\nthe Governor with the rest of the troops, and Chilichuchima with his\r\nguard left the following Monday. In the morning they were all ready with\r\ntheir arms and other necessary things; the journey they were to make\r\nbeing long, they were to leave all the baggage in Xauxa, it not being\r\nconvenient to carry it with them on that journey. The Governor journeyed\r\ntwo days down the valley along the bank of the Xauxa River, which was\r\nvery delectable and peopled in many places, and on the third day he\r\narrived at a bridge of net-work which is over the said river and which\r\nthe Indian soldiers had burned after they crossed over, but already the\r\ncaptain who had gone ahead had made the natives rebuild it. And in the\r\nplaces where they build these bridges of net-work, where the rivers are\r\nswollen, this inland country far from the sea being densely populated,\r\nand because almost none of the Indians knows how to swim, because of\r\nwhich even though the rivers are small and might be forded, they\r\nnevertheless throw out these bridges, and after this fashion; If the two\r\nbanks of the river are stony, they raise upon them large walls of stone,\r\nand then they place four [ropes of] pliable reeds two palms or a little\r\nless in thickness, and between them, after the fashion of wattle-work,\r\nthey weave green osiers two fingers thick and well intertwined, in such\r\na way that some are not left more slack than others, and all are well\r\ntied. And upon these they place branches crosswise in such a way that\r\nthe water is not seen, and in this way they make the floor of the\r\nbridge. And in the same manner they weave a balustrade of these same\r\nosiers along the side of the bridge so that no one may fall into the\r\nwater, of which, in truth, there is no danger, although to one who is\r\nnot used to it, the matter of crossing appears a thing of danger\r\nbecause, the span being long, the bridge bends when one goes over it, so\r\nthat one goes continually downward until the middle is reached, and from\r\nthere he keeps going up until he has finished crossing to the other\r\nbank, and when the bridge is being crossed, it trembles very much, so\r\nthat it goes to the head of him who is not accustomed to it. Ordinarily\r\nthey make two bridges close together, so that, as they say, the lords\r\nmay cross by one and the common people by another. They keep guards over\r\nthem, and the lords of all the land keep them there continuously in\r\norder that if someone should steal gold or silver or anything else from\r\nhim or from some other lord of the land, he would not be able to cross.\r\nAnd those who guard these bridges have their houses nearby, and they\r\nalways have in their hands osiers and wattles and cords in order to mend\r\nthe bridges if they are injured or even to rebuild them if need were.\r\nThe guards who were in charge of this bridge when the Indians who burned\r\nit passed over, hid the materials which they had for mending it, for\r\notherwise the Indians would have burned them also, and for this reason\r\nthey rebuilt it in so short a space of time in order that the Spaniards\r\nmight cross over. The Spanish cavalry and the Governor crossed by one of\r\nthese bridges, although, on account of its being new and not well made,\r\nthey had much trouble because the captain who had gone ahead with\r\nseventy cavalrymen had made many holes in it so that it was half\r\ndestroyed. Still, the horses got over without endangering themselves,\r\nalthough nearly all stumbled because the bridge moved and trembled so,\r\nbut, as I have said, the bridge was made in such a way that even though\r\nthey were thrown upon their knees, they could not fall into the water.\r\nAs soon as all were over, the Governor encamped in some groves near\r\nwhich ran some streams of beautiful clear water. Later they proceeded\r\non their journey two leagues along the shore of that river through a\r\nnarrow valley on both sides of which were very high mountains, and in\r\nsome places, this valley through which the river passes has so little\r\nspace that there is not more than a stone's throw from the foot of the\r\nmountain to the river, and in other places, because of the slope of the\r\nmountain, there is but little more. Two leagues of this valley having\r\nbeen travelled, they came to another bridge, a small one over another\r\nriver, over which the troops passed on foot while the horses forded, as\r\nmuch on account of the bridge being in bad order as on account of the\r\nfact that the water was low at that time. Having crossed the river, he\r\n[the Governor] began to climb a very steep and long mountain all made of\r\nsteps of very small stones.[35] Here the horses toiled so much that,\r\nwhen they had finished going up, the greater part of them had lost their\r\nshoes and worn down the hoofs of all four feet. That mountain, which\r\nlasted for more than half a league, having been overcome, and having\r\njourneyed for a bit in the evening along a slope, the Governor with his\r\nmen arrived at a village which the hostile Indians had sacked and\r\nburned, on account of which neither people nor maize was found in it,\r\nnor any other food, and the water was very far off because the Indians\r\nhad broken the aqueducts which came to the city, which was a great evil\r\nand of much inconvenience for the Spaniards who, because they had found\r\nthe road hard, toilsome and long on that day, needed good lodging. The\r\nnext day the Governor set out from there and went to sleep in another\r\nvillage which, although it was very large and fine and full of houses,\r\nhad as little food in it as the last one; and this village is called\r\nPanarai. The Governor wondered greatly with his men at finding here\r\nneither food nor anything else, because this place belonged to one of\r\nthe lords who had been with Atabalipa and with the dead lord in the\r\ncompany of the Christians, and he had come in their company as far as\r\nXauxa, [where] he said he wished to go ahead in order to prepare in this\r\nland his victuals and other things necessary for the Spaniards. And when\r\nthey found here neither him nor his people, it was held to be certain\r\nthat the country-side had revolted. And not having had any letter from\r\nthe captain who had gone ahead with the seventy horsemen, save which let\r\nthem know that he was going right after the hostile Indians, it was\r\nfeared that the foe had taken some step whereby he was prevented from\r\nsending any messenger. The Spaniards sought so much, that they found\r\nsome maize and ewes, ... and the next day, early, they set out and\r\narrived at a village called Tarcos, where they met the cacique of the\r\ndistrict and some men who told them of the day on which had passed that\r\nway some Christians who were going to fight with the enemy who had\r\nestablished their camp in a neighboring settlement. All received this\r\nnews with great pleasure, and they found a good reception in that\r\nplace, because the cacique had brought to the plaza a large quantity of\r\nmaize, fire-wood, ewes, and other things of which the Spaniards had\r\ngreat need.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n    While proceeding on their journey they have news sent by the forty\r\n    Spanish horsemen of the state of the Indian army with which the\r\n    latter had fought victoriously.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the next day, which was Saturday, All Saints' day, the friar who was\r\nwith this company said mass in the morning, according to the custom of\r\nsaying it on such a day, and later all set out and journeyed until they\r\narrived at a full river three leagues beyond, always descending from the\r\nmountains by a rough and long slope. This river, likewise, had a\r\nnet-work bridge which, being broken, made it necessary to ford the\r\nstream, and afterwards a very large mountain was ascended which, looked\r\nat from below, seemed impossible of ascent by the very birds of the air,\r\nand still more so by men on horseback toiling over the ground. But the\r\nclimb was made less arduous for them by the fact that the road went up\r\nin spirals, and not straight. The greater part, however, was made of\r\nlarge steps of stone which greatly fatigued the horses and wore down and\r\ninjured their hoofs, even though they were led by the bridle. In this\r\nmanner a long league was surmounted, and another was traversed by a more\r\neasy road along a declivity, and in the afternoon the Governor with the\r\nSpaniards arrived at a small village of which a part was burned, and in\r\nthe other part, which had remained whole, the Spaniards settled. And in\r\nthe evening two Indian couriers, sent by the captain who was ahead,\r\narrived. They brought news, in letters to the Governor, that the captain\r\nhad arrived with all speed at the land of Parcos[36] which he had left\r\nbehind him, having had news that the [Indian] captains were thereabout\r\nwith all the hostile forces; [but] he did not encounter them, and it was\r\nheld to be certain that they had withdrawn to Bilcas,[37] and through so\r\nmuch of the road as he traversed until coming to [a place] within five\r\nleagues of Bilcas, where he spent the night, he marched secretly in\r\norder not to be forestalled by certain spies who were placed a league\r\nfrom Bilcas. And having news that the enemy were in a town without\r\nhaving warning of his coming, the captain was delighted, and, having\r\ngone down the rather difficult slope where that place was, at dawn he\r\nentered [the town where some warriors were lodged with few\r\nprecautions].[38] The Spanish cavalry began to attack them in the plazas\r\nuntil so many had been killed or had fled that no one remained; because\r\nthere were a few Indian soldiers who had retired to a mountain on one\r\nside of the road who, as soon as the day became bright and they saw the\r\nSpaniards, assembled in squadrons, and came against them crying out\r\n_Ingres_,[39] which name they hold to be very insulting, being that of a\r\ncontemned people who live in the hot lands of the sea-coast, and because\r\nthat province was cold and the Spaniards wore clothes over their flesh,\r\n[the Indians] called them Ingres and threatened them with slavery as\r\nthey were few, not more than forty, and defying them by saying that they\r\nwould come down to where they were. The captain, although he knew that\r\nthat was a bad place for fighting on horseback, of which position the\r\nSpaniards could little avail themselves there, nevertheless, in order\r\nthat the enemy should not think that he would not fight from lack of\r\nspirit, took with him thirty horsemen, leaving the rest to guard the\r\ntown, and went down through a cleft[40] in the mountain by a very\r\npainful slope. The enemy boldly awaited them and in the shock of battle\r\nthey killed one horse and wounded two others, but finally, all being\r\ndispersed, some fled in one direction and others in another over the\r\nmountain [by] a very rough road where the horses could neither follow\r\nthem nor injure them. At this juncture, an [Indian] captain who had fled\r\nfrom the village, and who knew that they had killed one horse and\r\nwounded two, said \"Come, let us turn back and fight with these men\r\nuntil not one is left alive, for there are but a few of them!\" and at\r\nonce all returned with more spirit and greater impetuosity than before,\r\nand in this way a sharper battle than the first was fought. At the end,\r\nthe Indians fled and the horsemen followed them in all directions as\r\nlong as they could. In these two encounters more than six hundred men\r\nwere left dead, and it is believed also that Maila, one of their\r\ncaptains, died, and the Indians affirmed it also, and they, on their\r\npart, when they killed a horse, cut off his head and put it on a lance\r\nwhich they bore before them like a standard. [The Spanish captain]\r\nlikewise informed [his men] that he intended to rest there for three\r\ndays out of consideration for the wounded Christians and horses, and\r\nthat later they would set out to take, first of all, a bridge of\r\nnet-work which was near there, so that the fugitive enemies should not\r\ncross it and go to join with Quizquiz[41] in Cuzco and with the garrison\r\nof troops he had there, which was said to be waiting for the Spaniards\r\nin a bad pass near Cuzco. But, although they found it to be more than\r\nbad, they hoped in God who, in whatever place that battle might be\r\nfought, even in a land all rough and stony, would not permit the Indians\r\nto be able to defend themselves any where, no matter how difficult and\r\ntoilsome it might be, nor to attack the Spaniards in any bad pass. And,\r\nhaving set out from here and having crossed the bridge three leagues\r\nfrom Cuzco [the captain declared] that he would there await the Governor\r\nas he had informed him by swift messenger Indians of what had occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n    After having suffered various inconveniences, and having passed the\r\n    cities of Bilcas and of Andabailla,[42] and before arriving at\r\n    Airamba,[43] they have letters from the Spaniards in which they ask\r\n    for the aid of thirty cavaliers.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving received this letter, the Governor and all the Spaniards who were\r\nwith him were filled with infinite content over the victory which the\r\ncaptain had obtained, and at once he sent it, together with another, to\r\nthe city of Xauxa, to the treasurer and to the Spaniards who had\r\nremained there in order that they might share in the gladness over the\r\nvictory of the captain. And likewise he sent despatches to the captain\r\nand the Spaniards who were with him congratulating them much on the\r\nvictory they had won, and begging them and counseling them to be\r\ngoverned in these matters more by prudence than by confidence in their\r\nown strength, and commanding, at all events, that, having passed the\r\nlast bridge, they should await him [the Governor] there so that they\r\nmight then enter the city of Cuzco all together. This done, the Governor\r\nset out the following day and went by a rough and tiring road through\r\nrocky mountains and over ascents and descents of stone steps from which\r\nall believed they could only bring their horses with difficulty,\r\nconsidering the road already traversed and that still to be traversed.\r\nThey slept that night in a village on the other side of the river, which\r\nhere, as elsewhere, had a bridge of net-work. The horses crossed through\r\nthe water and the footsoldiers and the servants of the Spaniards by the\r\nbridge. On the next day they had a good road beside the river where they\r\nencountered many wild animals, deer and antelope; and that day they\r\narrived at nightfall at some rooms in the vicinity of Bilcas where the\r\ncaptain who was going ahead had made halt in order to travel by night\r\nand so enter Bilcas without being found out, as he did enter it, and\r\nhere was received another letter from him in which he said that he had\r\nleft Bilcas two days before, and had come to a river four leagues ahead\r\nwhich he had forded because the bridge had been burned, and here he had\r\nunderstood that the captain Narabaliba was fleeing with some twenty\r\nIndians and that he had met two thousand Indians whom the captain of\r\nCuzco had sent to him as aid who, as soon as they knew of the rout at\r\nBilcas, turned around and fled with him, endeavouring to join with the\r\nscattered remnants of those who were fleeing, in order to await them\r\n[the Spaniards] in a village called Andabailla,[44] and [the Spanish\r\ncaptain said] that he was resolved not to stay his course until he\r\nshould encounter them. These announcements being understood by the\r\nGovernor, he first thought of sending aid to the captain, but later he\r\ndid not do so because he considered that if there were to be a battle at\r\nall it would have occurred already and the aid would not arrive in\r\ntime, and he determined furthermore not to linger a single day until he\r\nshould catch up with him, and in this way he set out for Bilcas which he\r\nentered very early the following day, and on that day he did not wish to\r\ngo further. This city of Bilcas[45] is placed on a high mountain and is\r\na large town and the head of a province. It has a beautiful and fine\r\nfortress; there are many well built houses of stone, and it is half-way\r\nby road from Xauxa to Cuzco. And on the next day the Governor encamped\r\non the other side of the river, four leagues from Bilcas, and although\r\nthe day's march was short, it was nevertheless toilsome because it was\r\nentirely a descent almost all composed of stone steps, and the troops\r\nwaded the river with much fatigue because it was very full, and he set\r\nup his camp on the other bank among some groves. Scarcely had the\r\nGovernor arrived here, when he received a letter from the captain who\r\nwas reconnoitring in which the latter informed him that the enemy had\r\ngone on five leagues and were in waiting on the slope of a mountain in\r\na land called Curamba,[46] and that there were many warriors there, and\r\nthat they had made many preparations and had arranged great quantities\r\nof stones so that the Spaniards would not be able to go up. The\r\nGovernor, when he understood this, although the captain did not ask him\r\nfor aid, believed that it was necessary now, and he at once ordered the\r\nMarshal D. Diego de Almagro to get ready with thirty light horsemen,\r\nwell equipped as to arms and horses, and he did not wish him to take a\r\nsingle peon with him, because he ordered him [Almagro] not to delay for\r\nanything until he should come up with the captain who was ahead with the\r\nothers. And when he [Almagro] had set out, the Governor likewise\r\nstarted, on the following day, with ten horsemen and the twenty peons\r\nwho were guarding Chilichuchima, and he quickened his pace so much that\r\nday that of two days' marches he made one. And just as he was about to\r\narrive at the village called Andabailla, where he was to sleep, an\r\nIndian came to him on the run to say that on a certain slope of the\r\nmountain, which he pointed out with his finger, there had been\r\ndiscovered hostile troops of war, on which account, the Governor, armed\r\nas he was and on horseback, went with the Spaniards he had with him to\r\ntake the summit of that slope, and he examined the whole of it without\r\nfinding the warriors of whom the Indian had spoken, because they were\r\ntroops native to the land who were fleeing from the Indians of Quito\r\nbecause the latter did them very great harm. The Governor and company\r\nhaving arrived at that village of Andabailla, they supped and spent the\r\nnight there. On the next day, they arrived at the village of Airamba\r\nfrom where the captain had written that he was with the armed troops\r\nwaiting for them upon the road.[47]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n    Having arrived at a village, they find much silver in plates\r\n    twenty-feet long. Proceeding on their journey, they receive letters\r\n    from the Spaniards relating the brisk and adverse struggle they had\r\n    had against the army of the Indians.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere were found two dead horses,[48] from which it was suspected that\r\nsome misfortune had befallen the captain. But, having entered the\r\nvillage, they learned, from a letter that arrived before they retired\r\nfor the night, that the captain had here encountered some warriors, and\r\nthat, in order to gain the mountain, he had gone up a slope where he had\r\nfound assembled a great quantity of stone, a sign which showed that they\r\n[the Indians] wished to guard [the pass], and that they were gone in\r\nsearch of [other] Indians because they had warning that [the Spaniards]\r\nwere not far off and that the two horses had died of so many changes\r\nfrom heat to cold. He [the captain] wrote nothing of the aid which the\r\nGovernor had sent to him, because of which it was thought that it had\r\nnot yet arrived. The next day the Governor set out from there, and slept\r\n[the next night] by a river whose bridge had been burned by the enemy,\r\nso that it was necessary to ford it, with great fatigue on account of\r\nthe fact that the current was very swift and the bottom very stony. On\r\nthe next day, they encamped at a town in the houses of which was found\r\nmuch silver in large slabs twenty feet long, one broad, and one or two\r\nfingers thick. And the Indians who were there related that those slabs\r\nbelonged to a great cacique and that one of the lords of Cuzco had won\r\nthem and had carried them off thus in plates, together with those of\r\nwhich the conquered cacique had built a house.[49] The next day, the\r\nGovernor set out in order to cross the last bridge, which was almost\r\nthree leagues from there. Before he arrived at that river, a messenger\r\ncame with a letter from the captain in which he informed him that he had\r\narrived at the last bridge with great speed in order that the enemy\r\nshould not have opportunity to burn it; but that, at the time of his\r\narrival there, they had finished burning it, and as it was already late,\r\nhe did not wish to cross the river that same day, but had gone to camp\r\nin a village which was nearby. The next day, he [the captain] had passed\r\nthrough the water, which came to the breasts of the horses, and had\r\nproceeded straight along the road to Cuzco which was twelve leagues from\r\nthere; and as, on the way, he was informed that, on a neighbouring\r\nmountain [where] forts had been built, all the enemies were hoping that\r\nthe next day Quizquiz would come to their aid with reënforcements from\r\nthe troops which he had in Cuzco, for this reason he [the captain] had\r\nspurred ahead with all speed together with fifty horsemen,[50] for ten\r\nhad been left guarding the baggage and certain gold which had been\r\nfound in the rout of Bilcas. And one Saturday, at noon, they had begun\r\nto go up on horseback a slope which lasted well over a league, and,\r\nbeing wearied by the sharp ascent and by the mid-day heat, which was\r\nvery great, they stopped awhile and gave to the horses some maize which\r\nthey had because the natives of a village nearby had brought it to them.\r\nThen, proceeding on their journey, the captain, who rode a cross-bow\r\nshot ahead, saw the enemy on the summit of the mountain, which they\r\nentirely covered, and [he saw] that three or four thousand were coming\r\ndown in order to pass the point where they [the Spaniards] were. Because\r\nof this, although he called to the Spaniards to put themselves in\r\nbattle-array, he could not hope to join them, because the Indians were\r\nalready very near and were coming with great rapidity. But with those\r\nwho were in readiness, he advanced to give battle [to the Indians], and\r\nthe Spaniards who kept coming up mounted the slope of the mountain, some\r\non one hand, others on the other. They dashed among those of the enemy\r\nwho were foremost without waiting for the beginning of the fight, save\r\nfor defending themselves against the stones which were hurled upon them,\r\nuntil they mounted to the summit of the mountain, in which deed they\r\nthought they saw a certain victory to be accomplished. The horses were\r\nso tired that they could not get breath in order to attack with\r\nimpetuosity such a multitude of enemies, nor did the latter cease to\r\ninconvenience and harass them continually with the lances stones and\r\narrows which they hurled at them, so they fatigued all to such an extent\r\nthat the riders could hardly keep their horses at the trot or even at\r\nthe pace. The Indians, perceiving the weariness of the horses, began to\r\ncharge with greater fury, and five Christians, whose horses could not go\r\nup to the summit of the slope, were charged so furiously by so many of\r\nthe throng that to two of them it was impossible to alight, and they\r\nwere killed upon their horses. The others fought on foot very\r\nvalorously, but at length, not being seen by any companions who could\r\nbring them aid, they remained prisoners, and only one was killed without\r\nbeing able to lay hand upon his sword or to defend himself, the cause of\r\nwhich was that a good soldier was left dead beside him, the tail of his\r\nhorse having been seized which prevented his going ahead with the rest.\r\nThey [the Indians] opened the heads of all by means of their battle-axes\r\nand clubs; they wounded eighteen horses and six Christians; but none of\r\nthe wounds were dangerous save those of one horse which died of them. It\r\npleased God Our Lord that the Spaniards should gain a plain which was\r\nnear that mountain, and the Indians collected on a hill nearby. The\r\ncaptain commanded half of his men to take the bridles off their horses\r\nand let them drink in a rivulet that ran there, and then to do the same\r\nfor the other half, which was done without being hindered by the\r\nenemies. Then, the captain said to all: \"Gentlemen, let us withdraw from\r\nhere step by step down this declivity in such a way that the enemy may\r\nthink that we are fleeing from them, in order that they may come in\r\nsearch of us below, for, if we can attract them to this plain, we will\r\nattack them all of a sudden in such a manner that I hope not one of them\r\nwill escape from our hands. Our horses are already somewhat tired, and\r\nif we put the enemy to flight, we shall end by gaining the summit of the\r\nmountain.\" And thus it was that some of the Indians, thinking that the\r\nSpaniards were retreating, came down below, throwing stones at them,\r\nwith their slings, and shooting arrows.[51] When this was seen by the\r\nChristians, [they knew] that now was their time, [and] they turned their\r\nhorses' heads, and before the Indians could gather together on the\r\nmountain where they were before, some twenty of them were killed. When\r\nthis was seen by the others, and when they perceived that there was\r\nlittle safety in the place where they were, they left that mountain and\r\nretired to another one which was higher. The captain, with his men,\r\nfinished climbing the mountain, and there, because it was already night,\r\nhe camped with his soldiers. The Indians also camped two cross-bow shots\r\naway, in such a manner that in either camp could be heard the voices in\r\nthe other. The captain caused the wounds to be cared for and posted\r\npatrols and sentinels for the night, and he ordered that all the horses\r\nwere to remain saddled and bridled until the following day, on which he\r\nwas to fight with the Indians. And he tried to cheer his men up and\r\nrenew their valor, saying: \"that by all means it was necessary to attack\r\nthe enemy the following morning without delaying an instant, because he\r\nhad news that the captain Quizquiz was coming with great reënforcements,\r\nand by no means should they wait until he joined forces with them.\" All\r\nshowed as much spirits and confidence as if they already had the victory\r\nin their hands, and again the captain comforted them, saying: \"he held\r\nthe day just passed through to be more perilous than that which awaited\r\nthem on the morrow, and that God Our Lord who had delivered them from\r\ndanger in the past would grant them victory in the future, and that they\r\nshould look to it whether, on the day before, when their horses were so\r\nweary, they had attacked their enemies with disadvantage and had routed\r\nthem and driven them from their fortresses, even though their own number\r\ndid not exceed fifty, and that of the enemy eight thousand; ought they\r\nnot, then, to hope for victory when they were fresh and rested?\" With\r\nthese and other spirited conversations, that night was passed, and the\r\nIndians were in their own camp, uttering cries and saying: \"Wait,\r\nChristians, until dawn, when you are all to die, and we shall take away\r\nfrom you just as many horses as you have!\"[52] and they added insulting\r\nwords in their language having determined to enter into combat with the\r\nChristians as soon as it should dawn, believing them and their horses to\r\nbe weary on account of the toil of the day before and because they saw\r\nthem to be so few in numbers and because they knew that many of the\r\nhorses were wounded. In this manner the same thought prevailed on the\r\none side and on the other, but the Indians firmly believed that the\r\nChristians would not escape from them.[53]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n    News comes of the victory won by the Spaniards, even to their\r\n    putting the Indian army to flight. They command that a chain be\r\n    placed about the neck of Chilichuchima, holding him to be a traitor.\r\n    They cross the Rimac[54] and all reunite once more at\r\n    Sachisagagna,[55] where they burn Chilichuchima.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis news reached the Governor near the last river, as I have said, and\r\nhe, without showing any change in his countenance, communicated it to\r\nthe ten horsemen and twenty peons whom he had with him, consoling them\r\nall with good words which he spoke to them, although they were greatly\r\ndisturbed in their minds, for they thought that if a small number of\r\nIndians, relatively to the number anticipated, had maltreated the\r\nChristians in such a manner in the first action, they would bring upon\r\nthem still greater war on the following day when their horses were\r\nwounded and when the aid of thirty horsemen, which had been sent to\r\nthem, had not yet arrived among the Spaniards. But all showed that they\r\nknew how to place their hopes in God, and they arrived at the river\r\nwhich they crossed in _balsas_, swimming the horses, because the bridge\r\nwas burned down. And the river being very full, they delayed in crossing\r\nit the rest of that day and the next one until the hour of siesta when\r\nthe Governor, smiling [determined] to set out without waiting for the\r\nIndian allies to cross.[56] [Just then] a Christian was seen coming, and\r\nwhen all saw him from afar, they judged that the captain with the\r\nhorsemen had been routed and that this man was bringing the news in his\r\nflight. But when he had arrived in the presence of the Governor, he gave\r\ngreat consolation to the minds of all with the news that he brought,\r\nrelating that God Our Lord, who never abandons his faithful servants\r\neven in the direst extremities, ordained that while the captain with\r\nthe others [of his company] was passing that night cautiously and\r\nencouraging his men for the combat on the morrow, the Marshal arrived\r\nwith the reënforcements of thirty horsemen which had been sent, and\r\nthese, together with the ten others whom they had left behind, made\r\nforty altogether, and when all perceived this, the first group felt as\r\nmuch pleasure as if they had resuscitated that day [just lived through],\r\nholding it to be certain that the victory would be theirs on the\r\nfollowing day. When day had come, which was Sunday, they all mounted at\r\ndawn, and, disposed in a wing formation in order to present a better\r\nfront, they attacked the rear of the Indians who, during the night, had\r\ndetermined to attack the Christians, but who, in the morning, seeing so\r\nmany soldiers, thought that some aid must have come to them during the\r\nnight, on account of which, not having the courage to put on a bold\r\nfront, and seeing that the Spaniards were coming up the slope in pursuit\r\nof them, turned their backs and retired from mountain to mountain. The\r\nSpaniards did not follow them because the land was rough, and besides, a\r\nmist arose which was so thick that they could not see one another, and\r\nyet withal, on the slope of a hill, they killed many of the enemy. At\r\nthis juncture, a thousand Indians in a squadron commanded by Quizquiz\r\narrived in aid of the Indians who, seeing the Christians on horseback\r\nand so warlike, judged it time to withdraw to the mountain.[57] At the\r\nsame time, the Christians assembled in their [the Indians'] fort, whence\r\nthe captain had sent this messenger to the Governor to tell him that he\r\nwould await him there until he should arrive. When this news was heard\r\nby the Governor, he rejoiced greatly over the victory which God Our Lord\r\nhad given him when he least expected it, and without delaying an instant\r\nhe ordered that all should go forward with the dunnage and the remaining\r\nIndians, because, jointly with this news, he had received warning that\r\nin the retreat of this hostile force of soldiers, four thousand men had\r\nsplit off from the rest, and that therefore he should proceed\r\ncautiously, and should also be very sure that Chilichuchima was\r\narranging and commanding all this and was giving advice to the enemy as\r\nto what they were to do, and that, on this account, he should bear\r\nhimself with caution. When the Governor had finished his day's march, he\r\nhad chains put upon Chilichuchima and said to him: \"Well you know how I\r\nhave always borne myself toward you and how I have always tried [to be\r\ngenerous with you], making you the captain who should rule all this land\r\nuntil the son of Atabalipa should come from Quito in order to be made\r\nlord [of it], and although I have had many causes for putting you to\r\ndeath, I have not wished to do so, believing always that you would mend\r\nyour ways. Likewise, I have asked you many times to urge these hostile\r\nIndians, with whom you have influence and friendliness, to calm\r\nthemselves and lay down their arms, since, although they had done much\r\nharm and had killed Guaritico[58] who came from Xauxa at my command, I\r\nwould pardon them all. But in spite of all these admonitions of mine you\r\nhave wished to persist in your evil attitude and intentions, thinking\r\nthat the advice which you gave to the hostile captains was powerful\r\nenough to make your wicked design succeed. But now you can see how, with\r\nthe aid of our God, we have always routed them, and that it will always\r\nbe so in the future, and you may be very sure that they will not be able\r\nto escape nor to return to Quito whence they came, nor will you ever\r\nagain see Cuzco[59] because as soon as I have arrived at the place where\r\nthis captain is with my soldiers, I shall cause you to be burned alive\r\nbecause you have known how to keep so ill the friendship which, in the\r\nname of Caesar,[60] my lord, I have agreed upon with you. Have no doubt\r\nthat this will be done unless you urge these Indian friends of yours to\r\nlay down their arms and come in peace, as I have asked you to do many\r\ntimes before.\" To all these reasonings Chilichuchima listened\r\nattentively without returning a word. But always firm in his obstinacy,\r\nhe [at length] replied: \"that those captains had not done as he had\r\nordered them to do because they did not wish to obey him, and, for that\r\nreason he had not remained to make them understand that they must come\r\nin peace,\" and with such words he excused himself from what was\r\nattributed to him. But the Governor, who already knew of certain of his\r\ndealings, left him with his evil thoughts and did not return to speak to\r\nhim upon the matter. Then, having crossed the river in the afternoon,\r\nthe Governor went forward with those soldiers and arrived by night in a\r\nvillage called Rimac[61] a league from that river. And there the Marshal\r\narrived, with four horsemen, to wait for him, and after they had talked\r\ntogether, they set out the next day for the camp of the Spaniards where\r\nthey arrived in the afternoon, the captain and many others having come\r\nout to meet them, and all rejoiced greatly at seeing themselves all\r\ntogether again. The Governor gave each one thanks, according to his\r\nmerits, for the valour they had shown, and all set out together in the\r\nevening and arrived two leagues further on at a village called\r\nSachisagagna.[62] The captains informed the Governor all that had\r\nhappened, just as I have related it. When they were all lodged in this\r\nvillage, the captain and the Marshal urged the Governor to do justice on\r\nChilichuchima, because he ought to know that Chilichuchima advised the\r\nenemy of all that the Christians did, and that he it was who had made\r\nthe Indians come out of the mountains of Bilcas, exhorting them to come\r\nand fight with the Christians who were few and who, with their horses,\r\ncould not climb those mountains save step by step and on foot, and\r\ngiving them, at the same time, a thousand other counsels as to where\r\nthey were to wait and what they were to do, like a man who had seen\r\nthose places and who knew the skill of the Christians with whom he had\r\nlived so long a time. Informed of all these things, the Governor gave\r\norders that he was to be burned alive in the middle of the plaza, and\r\nso it was done, for his chiefs and most familiar friends were those who\r\nwere quickest in setting fire to him.[63] The religious[64] tried to\r\npersuade him to become a Christian, saying to him that those who were\r\nbaptized and who believed with true faith in our saviour Jesus Christ\r\nwent to glory in paradise and that those who did not believe in him went\r\nto hell and its tortures. He made him understand this by means of an\r\ninterpreter. But he [Chilichuchima] did not wish to be a Christian,\r\nsaying that he did not know what sort of thing this law was, and he\r\nbegan to invoke Paccamaca[65] and captain Quizquiz that they might come\r\nto his aid. This Paccamaca the Indians have as their God and they offer\r\nhim much gold and silver, and it is a well-known thing that the demon is\r\nin that idol and speaks with those who come to ask him something.[66]\r\nAnd of this matter I have spoken at length in the relation which was\r\nsent to H. M. from Caxamalca. In this way this captain paid for the\r\ncruelties which he committed in the conquests of Atabalipa, and for the\r\nevils which he plotted to the hurt of the Spaniards and in disservice of\r\nH. M. All the people of the country rejoiced infinitely at his death,\r\nbecause he was very much abhorred by all who knew what a cruel man he\r\nwas.[67]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n    A son of the cacique Guainacaba[68] visits them; they agree upon\r\n    friendship with him, and he tells them of the movements of the army\r\n    of hostile Indians with which they have some encounters before\r\n    entering Cuzco, where they establish as lord the son of\r\n    Guainacaba.[69]\r\n\r\n\r\nHere the Spaniards rested that night, having set good guards, because\r\nthey were given to understand that Quizquiz was close by with all his\r\nmen. And on the following morning, came to visit the Governor a son of\r\nGuainacaba and a brother of the dead cacique Atabalipa,[70] and the\r\ngreatest and most important lord who was then in that land; and he had\r\never been a fugitive so that those of Quito might not kill him. This man\r\nsaid to the Governor that he would aid him to the extent of his power in\r\norder to drive from that land all those of Quito, who were his enemies\r\nand who hated him and did not wish to be the subjects of a foreign\r\npeople. This man was the man to whom, by law, came all that province and\r\nwhom all the caciques of it wished for their lord. When he came to see\r\nthe Governor, he came through the mountains, avoiding the roads for fear\r\nof those of Quito, and the Governor received him with great gladness and\r\nreplied to him: \"Much does what you say please me, as does also finding\r\nyou with so good a desire to expel these men of Quito, and you must know\r\nthat I have come from Xauxa for no other purpose than to prevent them\r\nfrom doing you harm and free you from slavery to them, and you can\r\nbelieve that I have not come for my own benefit because I was in Xauxa,\r\nsure of having war with them and I had an excuse for not making this\r\nlong and difficult journey. But knowing the injuries they were doing to\r\nyou, I wanted to come to rectify and undo them, as the Emperor my lord\r\ncommanded me to do. And so, you may be sure that I will do in your favor\r\nall that seems suitable for me to do. And I will do the same to\r\nliberate from this tyranny the people of Cuzco.\" The Governor made him\r\nall these promises in order to please him so that he might continue to\r\ngive news of how affairs were going, and that cacique remained\r\nmarvellously satisfied, as did also those who had come with him. And he\r\n[Manco] replied: \"Henceforth I shall give you exact information\r\nconcerning all that they of Quito do in order that they may not\r\ninconvenience you.\" And in this manner he took leave of the Governor,\r\nsaying: \"I am going to fish because I know that tomorrow the Christians\r\ndo not eat flesh, and I shall encounter this messenger who tells me that\r\nQuizquiz is going with his men to burn Cuzco and that he is now near at\r\nhand, and I have wished to warn you of it in order that you may fix upon\r\na remedy.\" The Governor at once placed all the soldiers upon the alert,\r\nand, although it was already noon, when he knew the needs of the\r\nsituation, he did not wish to delay even to eat, but journeyed with all\r\nthe Spaniards straight toward Cuzco, which was four leagues from that\r\nplace, with the intention of establishing his camp near the city so as\r\nto enter it early the next day. And when he had travelled two leagues,\r\nhe saw rise up in the distance a great smoke, and when he asked some\r\nIndians the cause of it, they told him that a squadron of the men of\r\nQuizquiz had come down a mountain and set fire [word missing]. Two\r\ncaptains went ahead with some forty horsemen to see if they could catch\r\nup with this squadron, which speedily joined with the men of Quizquiz\r\nand the other captains who were on a slope a league in front of Cuzco\r\nwaiting for the Christians in a pass close to the road. Seen by the\r\ncaptains and Spaniards, they [the Indians] could not avoid an encounter\r\nwith them, although the Governor had them made to understand that they\r\n[the Spaniards] would wait for the rest to join them, which they would\r\nhave done, were it not for the fact that the Indians incited each other\r\nwith much spirit to encounter them. And before they [the Spaniards]\r\ncould be attacked, they fell upon them on the skirt of a hill, and in a\r\nshort time they routed them, forcing them to flee to the mountain and\r\nkilling two hundred of them. Another squad of cavalry crossed over\r\nanother slope of the mountain where were two or three thousand Indians\r\nwho, not having the pluck to wait for them, threw down their lances in\r\norder to be able to run the better, and fled headlong. And after those\r\nfirst two squads broke and fled, they [the Spaniards] made them flee to\r\nthe heights; and [at the same time] two Spanish light horsemen saw\r\ncertain Indians return down the slope, and they set themselves to\r\nskirmish with them. They perceived that they were in great danger, but\r\nthey were helped, and the horse of one of them was killed, from which\r\nthe Indians derived so much encouragement that they wounded four or five\r\nhorses and a Christian, and they made them retreat as far as the plain.\r\nThe Indians who, until then, had not seen the Christians retire, thought\r\nthat they were doing it in order to attract them to the plain and there\r\nattack them as they had done at Bilcas, and they said so among\r\nthemselves and were cautious, not wishing to go down and follow them. By\r\nthis time the Governor had arrived with the [rest of] the Spaniards and,\r\nas it was already late, they set up their camp on a plain, and the\r\nIndians maintained themselves an arquebuse-shot away on a slope until\r\nmid-night, yelling, and the Spaniards spent all that night with their\r\nhorses saddled and bridled. And the next day, at the first ray of dawn,\r\nthe Governor arranged the troops, horse and foot, and he took the road\r\nto Cuzco, with good understanding and caution, believing that the enemy\r\nwould come to attack him on the road, but none of them appeared. In this\r\nway the Governor and his troops entered that great city of Cuzco without\r\nany other resistance or battle on Friday, at the hour of high mass, on\r\nthe fifteenth day of the month of November of the year of the birth of\r\nour Saviour and Redeemer Jesus Christ MDXXXIII. The Governor caused all\r\nthe Christians to lodge in the dwellings around the plaza of the city,\r\nand he ordered that all should come forth with their horses to the plaza\r\nand sleep in their tents, until it could be seen whether the enemy were\r\ncoming to attack them. This order was continued and observed for a\r\nmonth. On another day, the Governor created as lord that son of\r\nGuainacaba, for he was young, prudent and alive and the most important\r\nof all those who were there at that time, and was the one to whom that\r\nlordship came by law. And he did it so soon in order that the lords and\r\ncaciques should not go away to their own lands which were divers\r\nprovinces, and some very far away, and so that the natives should not\r\njoin those of Quito, but should have a separate lord of their own whom\r\nthey might reverence and obey and not organize themselves into bands. So\r\nhe commanded all the caciques to obey him [Manco] as their lord and to\r\ndo all that he should order them to do.[71]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n    The new cacique[72] goes with an army to drive Quizquiz from the\r\n    state of Quito. He has some encounters with the Indians, and,\r\n    because of the roughness of the roads, they return, and they later\r\n    go thither again with a company of Spaniards, and before they set\r\n    out, the cacique pays his obedience to the emperor.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as this was done, he [the Governor] gave orders to the new\r\ncacique to assemble many warriors in order to go and vanquish Quizquiz\r\nand drive from the land those of Quito, and he [the Governor] said to\r\nthe Inca that it was not regular that, when he was lord, another should\r\nremain in his land against his will, and [the Governor] said many other\r\nwords to him upon this subject in the presence of all in order that they\r\nmight see the favor which he did him [Manco] and the fondness which he\r\nshowed him, and this not for the sake of advantages that might result\r\nfrom it, but for his own [Manco's] sake.[73] The cacique had great\r\npleasure in receiving this order, and in the space of four days he\r\nassembled more than five thousand Indians, all in readiness with their\r\narms, and the Governor sent with them a captain of his own and fifty\r\ncavalrymen; he himself remained guarding the city with the rest of the\r\ntroops. When ten days had gone by, the captain returned and related to\r\nthe Governor what had happened, saying that at nightfall he had arrived\r\nwith his troops at the camp of Quizquiz five leagues from there, because\r\nhe had gone by a roundabout road through which the cacique guided\r\nhim.[74] But, before arriving at enemy's camp, he encountered two\r\nhundred Indians posted in a hollow, and because the land was rough he\r\nwas not able to take their fort away from them and to overpower them so\r\nthat they could not give notice of his coming, which they did do. But,\r\nalthough this company [of Indians] was in a strong place, it was not so\r\nbold as to wait for his attack and it withdrew to the other side of a\r\nbridge to cross which was impossible [for the Spaniards] because, from a\r\nmountain which dominated it, to which the Indians had retired, they\r\nhurled so many stones that no one was permitted to cross, and, because\r\nthe land was the roughest and most inaccessible that had been seen, they\r\n[the Spaniards] turned back. [The captain] said that two hundred Indians\r\nhad been killed, and that the cacique was much pleased at what [the\r\ncaptain] had done, and, on their return to the city had guided them\r\nthrough another and shorter road on which, in many places, the captain\r\nfound great quantities of stones piled up for defense against the\r\nChristians, and he found, among other passes, one so bad and difficult\r\nthat he, with all his troops, suffered great trials and could not follow\r\nit further. At that place it became apparent that the cacique had true,\r\nand not feigned, friendship for the Governor and Christians, for he led\r\nthem out of that road from which not one Spaniard could have escaped\r\n[alone]. [The captain] said that after he left the city, he did not go\r\nover as much as a cross-bow shot of flat land, and that all the country\r\nwas mountainous, stony and very difficult to traverse and [he added]\r\nthat if it had not been for the fact that it was the first time that the\r\ncacique was travelling with him and might impute it to fear, he would\r\nhave turned back. The Governor would have liked him to follow the enemy\r\nuntil he drove them from the place where they were, but when he heard\r\nthe nature of the place, he remained content with what had been done.\r\nThe cacique said that he had sent his soldiers after the enemy, and that\r\nhe thought they would do them some damage; and accordingly within four\r\ndays news came that they had killed a thousand Indians. The Governor\r\nonce more charged the cacique to cause more warriors to be assembled,\r\nand he himself wished to send with them some of his cavalry in order\r\nthat they might not desist until they had driven the enemy from the\r\nland. When he returned from [the first] trip, the cacique went to fast\r\nin a house which was on a mountain, a dwelling which his father had\r\nbuilt in another day; there he stayed three days, after which he came to\r\nthe plaza where the men of that land gave him obedience according to\r\ntheir usage, recognizing him as their lord and offering him the white\r\nplume, just as they had to the cacique Atabalipa in Caxamalcha. When\r\nthis was done, he caused all the caciques and lords who were there to\r\nassemble, and, having spoken to them concerning the harm that the men of\r\nQuito were doing in his land and about the good that would result to all\r\nif a stop were put to it, he commanded them to call and prepare warriors\r\nwho should go against those of Quito and drive them from the place in\r\nwhich they had posted themselves. This the captains did at once, and\r\nthey so managed to raise troops that, in the period of eight days, ten\r\nthousand warriors were in that city, all, picked men, and the Governor\r\ncaused to be prepared fifty light horsemen with a captain in order that\r\nthey might set out on the last day of the feast of the Nativity. The\r\nGovernor, before that journey was made, wishing to re-affirm peace and\r\nfriendship with that cacique and his people, when mass had been said on\r\nChristmas day by the religious,[75] went out to the plaza with many of\r\nthe soldiers of his company, and into the presence of the cacique and of\r\nthe lords of the land and of the warriors who were seated along with his\r\nSpaniards, the cacique on a stool and his men on the ground around him.\r\nThe Governor made them an address, as he was wont to do on such\r\noccasions, and by me, his secretary and the scrivener of the army, was\r\nread the demand and requirement which H. M. had sent, and its contents\r\nwere declared to them by an interpreter; all understood it and replied\r\n[in a friendly manner]. It was required of them that they should be and\r\nshould call themselves vassals of H. M., and the Governor received\r\n[their obedience] with the same ceremony as was used the other time,\r\nnamely, of twice raising the royal standard, and in testimony [of the\r\nfriendship] the Governor embraced them to the sound of trumpets,\r\nobserving other solemnities which I do not write in order to avoid\r\nprolixity. This done, the cacique stood up and, in a vase of gold, gave\r\ndrink to the Governor and the Spaniards with his own hands, and then all\r\nwent off to eat, it being already evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n    They suspect that the cacique wishes to rebel. It turns out to be\r\n    unfounded. Many Spaniards go with him and twenty thousand Indians\r\n    against Quizquiz, and of what happens to them they give news in a\r\n    letter to the Governor.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd when the Spanish captain with the Indians and the cacique were about\r\nto depart within two days in order to go against the enemy ...[76] the\r\nGovernor was informed by some Spaniards, some Indian friends and some\r\nallied natives of the country that among some of the cacique's chief\r\nmen, it was being talked of that they should join with the warriors of\r\nQuito, and they [the informers] accused him of other things. Because of\r\nthis, there arose some suspicion, and, in order to make sure as to\r\nwhether the friendship of the cacique for the Christians who loved him\r\nso was faithful and true, wishing to know truth of the matter, [the\r\nGovernor] caused the cacique and some of his chief men to be called, on\r\nthe next day, to his room. And he told them what was being said about\r\nthem; after investigation had been made and torture had been given to\r\nsome Indians, it came out that the cacique and the chiefs were without\r\nany blame, and it was certified that, neither by word nor deed, had they\r\ndone anything to the hurt of the Spaniards, but that two chiefs had said\r\nthat because their ancestors had never been subject to anyone neither\r\nthey nor the cacique ought to submit themselves [to the Spaniards]. But\r\nnotwithstanding this, by what was known then and afterwards, it was\r\nbelieved that the Indians always loved the Spaniards and that their\r\nfriendship with them was not feigned.[77] The troops did not set out on\r\ntheir journey because the rigor of winter [was at its height] and it\r\nrained a great deal every day, so it was determined to allow the height\r\nof the rainy season go by, principally because of the fact that many\r\nbridges had been ill-treated and broken, to mend which was essential.\r\nWhen the season in which the rains ceased arrived, the Governor had the\r\nfifty cavalrymen, the cacique the men he had and make ready. All of\r\nthese, with the captain whom he gave them, put themselves on the march\r\nfor Xauxa by way of the city of Bilcas,[78] where, it was understood,\r\nthe enemy were because the roads were cut up by the many winter rains\r\nand the rivers were swollen; although there was no bridge over many of\r\nthem, the Spaniards crossed on their horses with great trouble, and one\r\nof them was drowned. Arrived by [long] marches at the river which is\r\nfour leagues from Bilcas, it was learned that the enemy had gone on to\r\nXauxa. And the river being swollen and furious, and the bridge burned,\r\nit was necessary for them to stop and build it anew, for, without it, it\r\nwould have been impossible to cross the river, either in those boats\r\nwhich are called _balsas_ or by swimming or in any other way. Twenty\r\ndays the camp was here in order to mend the bridge, for the officers\r\n[maestros] had much to do, because the water was high and kept breaking\r\ndown the osier ropes which were put in place. And if the cacique had not\r\nhad so great a number of men to build the bridge and to cross over by it\r\nand pull over the ropes of osiers, it would not have been possible to\r\nbuild it. But having twenty-four thousand warriors, and by crossing [the\r\nstream] again and again to attempt [to set in place the ropes] making\r\nuse of cords and _balsas_, at last they succeeded in placing the osier\r\nropes and when they had been passed across [the river], the bridge was\r\nbuilt in a very short space of time. [It was] so good and well built\r\nthat another like it is not to be found in that land, for it is three\r\nhundred and seventy-odd feet long, and broad enough to allow two horses\r\nto cross at once without any risk. Then, having crossed that bridge and\r\nhaving arrived at Bilcas, the Spaniards found quarters in the city, from\r\nwhich they sent to the Governor a report on how affairs were\r\nprogressing. Here the camp stopped for some days, resting, in order\r\nthat they might have news of the place in which the enemy were, of which\r\nthey learned no more than that they had set out for Xauxa, and that they\r\nwere thinking of attacking the Spaniards who had remained there as\r\ngarrison. When he learned this, the captain at once set out with the\r\nSpaniards to aid [the garrison], taking with him a brother of the\r\ncacique and four thousand warriors. The cacique returned to Cuzco, and\r\nthe captain sent the governor a letter which his lieutenant wrote from\r\nXauxa in great haste, and which was of the following tenor: \"When your\r\nexcellency drove the enemy from Cuzco, they rallied and came to Xauxa,\r\nand before they arrived, it was learned by our men that they were coming\r\nin great force, because, from all the places of the region, they were\r\ndrawing as many men as they could, as much for warriors as to carry the\r\nsupplies and baggage; when this was learned by the treasurer Alfonso [in\r\nXauxa], he sent four light horsemen to a bridge which is twelve leagues\r\nfrom the city of Xauxa where the enemy were on the other side, in a very\r\nimportant province. When they had returned, the treasurer used his best\r\nefforts, as much in guarding the city and in treating well the caciques\r\nwho were there with him as in informing himself stealthily of all the\r\ndoings of the enemy. And the greatest suspicions which he had were of\r\nthe Indians who were in the town and in the region and who were very\r\nnumerous, because almost all were in agreement with the enemy to come\r\nand attack the Spaniards on four sides. With this agreement, the Indians\r\nof Quito crossed [the bridge before mentioned] with the intention that a\r\ncaptain with five hundred of their men should come from the direction of\r\na [certain] mountain and cross a river which is a quarter of a league\r\nfrom the city and place himself on the highest part of the mountain\r\n[near Xauxa] in order to assault the city on the day agreed upon between\r\nthem. The captain Quizquiz and Incurabaliba,[79] who were their chief\r\nleaders, were to come by the plains with a greater force of warriors.\r\nThis was speedily learned from an Indian to whom torture was given. The\r\ncaptain who was to cross the river and attack the city from the mountain\r\ntravelled rapidly and arrived a day before the rest of the warriors. And\r\none morning at dawn news came to the city of how many enemies had\r\ncrossed the bridge, from which was born a great disaffection among the\r\nnatives of Xauxa who [formerly] served the Christians loyally, from\r\nwhich it was supposed that the whole land had risen in arms, as has been\r\nsaid. First of all, the treasurer arranged that all the gold of H. M.\r\nand of the men which was in the city should be placed in a large house,\r\nand he set a guard of the feeblest and sickest Spaniards, ordering that\r\nthe rest should be prepared to fight; and he ordered ten light horsemen\r\nto go out to see how large a number of the enemy had crossed the river\r\nin order to take the mountain, and he himself, with the rest of the\r\nsoldiers, waited on the plaza in case the greater number of the enemy\r\nshould come by way of the plain. The Spanish scouts attacked the Indians\r\nwho had crossed the bridge; they retired, and the Spaniards had to cross\r\nthe bridge after them some peon cross-bowmen whom the treasurer had sent\r\nthem, so that the Indians turned and fled with great loss. The great\r\nblow of the others, who came by the plain, did not take place at the\r\ntime agreed upon with the others for assaulting the city, and in waiting\r\nfor it, they lost time. That night and the [following] day the city was\r\nvigilant, and the soldiers were always armed and their horses saddled,\r\nall being together in the plaza, thinking that on the following night\r\nthe Indians would come to attack the city and burn it, as it was said\r\nthat they intended to do. When [the first] two quarters of the night\r\nwere passed, seeing that the enemy did not appear, the treasurer took\r\nwith him a light-armed horseman and went to see in what place the enemy\r\nhad camped and how many of them had approached the city, [for the\r\nIndians who gave news of all this did not know where they were, and\r\nlikewise because the enemy took roads of which no one could give\r\ninformation], with the result that at daybreak the treasurer found\r\nhimself four leagues from the city, and, having seen the place where the\r\nIndians were and the nature of the site, he returned to the city at\r\nwhich he arrived a little after noon. When it was seen by the hostile\r\nIndians that the Spaniards had discovered them, they were in great fear,\r\nand got up from that site and went towards the city, and in the night\r\nthey came and took up a position a quarter of a league from the city\r\nbeside a small river which entered the large one. When this was known by\r\nthe Spaniards, they spent that night with the greatest caution, and on\r\nthe following day, after hearing mass, the treasurer took twenty light\r\nhorse and twenty peons with two thousand friendly Indians, leaving as\r\nmany more Spanish cavalry and some foot soldiers in the city with the\r\nunderstanding that they were to give a signal whenever the enemy should\r\nattack them so that the other [Spaniards] might come to aid them. Having\r\ngone out from the city with the lieutenant, the Spaniards saw that the\r\nIndians of Quito had crossed the little river with their squadrons in\r\nwhich there might be some six thousand of them, and, seeing the\r\nSpaniards, they turned and crossed to the other bank. Then, the\r\ntreasurer and the Spaniards perceiving that if they did not attack the\r\nIndians that day, the following night the latter would come to sack and\r\nset fire to the city, so that there would be greater trouble if night\r\nwas awaited, he [the treasurer] determined to cross the river and fight\r\nwith the enemy. A sharp skirmish was held [on the other side], as much\r\nwith cross-bows and arrows as with stones, and the treasurer, who was\r\ngoing in advance of the rest down the stream, received a stone on the\r\ncrown of his head which threw him from his horse into the midst of the\r\nriver, and, stunned, he was borne along quite a distance, so that he\r\nwould have been drowned had not some Spanish cross-bowmen who were\r\nthere helped him and pulled him from the water with much trouble. [The\r\nIndians] also gave his horse [a blow] in the leg which broke it, and he\r\ndied soon. From this the Spaniards drew great animosity, and they\r\nhastened to cross the river. Seeing their determination the Indians\r\nwithdrew, fleeing to a mountain where some hundred of them died. The\r\nhorsemen followed them through the mountains more than a league and a\r\nhalf, and [finally], because they withdrew to the strongest position of\r\nthe mountain, where the horses could not go up, [the Spaniards] went\r\nback to the city. And, soon perceiving that the Indians did not venture\r\nforth from that fortress [the Spaniards] determined to return once more\r\nagainst them, and twenty Spaniards with more than three thousand Indian\r\nfriends attacked them on that mountain where they were fortified and\r\nkilled many, driving them from that fortress and pursuing them more than\r\nthree leagues, killing many neighboring caciques who were in their\r\nfavor. With this victory the Indian friends were as much pleased as if\r\nthey alone had won it. The Indians of Quito re-assembled once more in a\r\nplace called Tarma five leagues from Xauxa, whence, likewise, they were\r\ndriven because they did much harm in the neighboring lands.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n    Of the great quantity of gold and silver which they caused to be\r\n    smelted from the figures of gold which the Indians adored. Of the\r\n    foundation of the city of Cuzco where a settlement of Spaniards was\r\n    established, and of the order which was set up there.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen this good news was learned by the Governor, he had it published at\r\nonce, and because of it the Spaniards were filled with content and gave\r\ninfinite thanks to God for having shown himself favorable in everything\r\nto this enterprise. Then the Governor wrote and sent couriers to the\r\ncity of Xauxa, giving to all his congratulations and thanking them for\r\nthe valor they had shown, and especially his lieutenant, asking him to\r\ngive him information of all that took place in the future. And in the\r\nmeanwhile, the Governor hastened matters for setting out thence, leaving\r\naffairs provided for in the city, founding a colony, and peopling\r\nplentifully the said city. He caused all the gold which had been\r\ncollected to be melted, which was in small pieces, an operation quickly\r\nperformed by Indians skilled in the process. And when the sum total was\r\nweighed, it was found to contain five hundred and eighty thousand, two\r\nhundred-odd pesos of good gold. The fifth for H. M. was taken out, and\r\nit was one hundred and sixteen thousand, and seventy-odd pesos of good\r\ngold. And the same smelting was performed for the silver, which was\r\nfound to contain two hundred and fifteen thousand marks, a little more\r\nor less, and of them one hundred and seventy thousand or so were fine\r\nsilver in vessels and plates, pure and good, and the rest was not so\r\nbecause it was in plates and pieces mixed with other metals from which,\r\naccording, the silver was extracted. And from all this, likewise, was\r\ntaken the fifth of H. M. Truly it was a thing worthy to be seen, this\r\nhouse where the melting took place, all full of so much gold in plates\r\nof eight and ten pounds each, and in vessels, and vases and pieces of\r\nvarious forms with which the lords of that land were served, and among\r\nother very sightly things were four sheep[80] in fine gold and very\r\nlarge, and ten or twelve figures of women of the size of the women of\r\nthat land, all of fine gold and as beautiful and well-made as if they\r\nwere alive. These they held in as much veneration as if they had been\r\nthe rulers of all the world, and alive [as well], and they dressed them\r\nin beautiful and very fine clothing, and they adored them as Goddesses,\r\nand gave them food and talked with them as if they were women of\r\nflesh.[81] These went to form a part of the fifth of H. M. There were,\r\nbesides, other odd silver objects of like form. The seeing of great\r\nvases and pieces of burnished silver was certainly a matter for great\r\nsatisfaction. The Governor divided and distributed all this treasure\r\namong all the Spaniards who were at Cuzco and those who remained in the\r\ncity of Xauxa, giving to each one as much good silver, and as much\r\nimpure, together with as much gold [as he deserved], and to each man who\r\nhad a horse he gave according to the man's merit and that of the horse\r\nand in accordance with the services he had done; and to the peons he did\r\nthe same according to what was posted up to his credit in the book of\r\ndistributions, which was kept [for this purpose]. All this was completed\r\nwithin eight days, and at the end of as many more, the Governor set out\r\nfrom here, leaving the city settled in the manner which has been told.\r\nIn the month of March, 1534, the Governor ordered that the greater part\r\nof the Spaniards he had with him should be assembled in this city, and\r\nhe made an act of foundation and settlement of the town, saying that he\r\nplaced it and founded it in his own authority[82] and he took possession\r\nof it in the middle of the plaza. And as a sign of the foundation and of\r\nthe commencement of building and founding the colony, he held certain\r\nceremonies in accordance with the act which was drawn up, which I, the\r\nscrivener, read in a loud voice in the presence of all. And the name of\r\nthe city was agreed upon, \"the very noble and great city of Cuzco.\" And,\r\ncontinuing the settlement, he appointed the site[83] for the church\r\nwhich was to be built, its boundaries, limits, and jurisdiction, and\r\nimmediately afterward he proclaimed that all who might come to settle\r\nhere would be received as citizens, and many came in the next three\r\nyears.[84] From among them all they chose the persons most fitted for\r\nundertaking the charge of governing public affairs, and he [the\r\nGovernor] appointed his lieutenant, alcaldes and ordinary regidores and\r\nother public officials, all of whom he chose in the name of H. M. and he\r\ngave them the powers to exercise their offices. This done, the Governor,\r\nwith the consent and advice of the religious whom he had with him and of\r\nH. M.'s paymaster who was then with him, with whose assistance he looked\r\nover and considered the circumstances of the citizens until as many [had\r\nbeen chosen] as H. M. had arranged should take part in the\r\n_repartimiento_ of the natives; in the meanwhile a certain number of\r\nthem [Indians] was assigned to all the Spaniards who were to remain, in\r\norder that they might instruct them in the things of our holy catholic\r\nfaith. And there set aside and given to the service of H. M. twelve\r\nthousand-odd married Indians in the province of the Collao in the middle\r\nthereof, near the mines, in order that they might take out gold for H.\r\nM. from which, it is understood, there will be great profits,\r\nconsidering the great wealth of the mines which are there, of which\r\nmatters lengthy mention is made in the book of the foundation of this\r\ncolony and in the register of the deposit which was made by the\r\nneighbouring Indians. And the approving, confirming or amending of these\r\narrangements was left to the will of H. M. according as should seem best\r\nto suit his royal service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n    The Governor sets out with the cacique for Xauxa, and they receive\r\n    news of the army of Quito, and of certain ships which some Spaniards\r\n    who went to the city of San Miguel saw on those coasts.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen these things were done, the Governor set out for Xauxa, taking the\r\ncacique with him, and the citizens remained guarding the city\r\n[according] to orders which the Governor left them so that they might\r\ngovern themselves until he should command something else. Journeying by\r\nforced marches, on the day of Easter, he found himself on the Bilcas\r\nriver, where he learned from letters and notices from Xauxa, that the\r\nwarriors of Quito, after they were routed and driven from their last\r\npositions by the captain from Cuzco, had withdrawn and fortified\r\nthemselves forty leagues from Xauxa on the Caxamalcha road in a bad\r\npass in the immediate vicinity of the road, and had built their walls to\r\nprevent the [possibility of] the horses [crossing] the pass. [These\r\nwalls had] some very narrow gates in them, and a street by which to\r\nmount a high boulder where the captain and the warriors lived and which\r\nhad no other entrance than this one by way of this fort that they had\r\nbuilt with these very narrow doors; [and the Governor learned] that they\r\nwere planning to await aid here, because it was known that the son of\r\nAtabalipa was coming with many warriors. This news the Governor\r\ncommunicated to the cacique who at once sent off couriers to the city of\r\nCuzco in order to cause warriors to come who should not exceed two\r\nthousand in number, but who were to be the best there were in all that\r\nprovince, because the Governor told him that it would be better were\r\nthey few and good than if they were many and unserviceable, because the\r\nmany would destroy the food in the land through which they were to pass\r\nwithout necessity or profit. At the same time the Governor wrote to the\r\nlieutenant and corregidor of Cuzco that he should aid the captains of\r\nthe cacique and see to it that the warriors came soon. On the second day\r\nafter Easter, the Governor set out from this place, and, by forced\r\nmarches, arrived in Xauxa, where he learned the whole of what had passed\r\nthere in his absence, and especially what those of Quito had done, and,\r\nin particular, they told him that after the enemy was put to flight from\r\nthe environs of Xauxa, they had retired twenty or thirty leagues from\r\nthere into the mountains, and that, according to the captain who went\r\nout against them with the brother of the cacique and four thousand men,\r\nthey arrived within sight of them [the Indians], and that, after a rest\r\nof a few days, they went to attack them and routed them and drove them\r\nfrom that place with much trouble and great danger. When they [the\r\nSpanish force] had returned to Xauxa, the Marshal Don Diego de Almagro\r\nwho, when the captain and Spaniards came from Cuzco, had come with them\r\nby order of the Governor to inspect the Indians round about in order to\r\nsee and know the state of things in that city and among its citizens,\r\nwent out to visit the caciques and lords of the region of Chincha[85]\r\nand Pachacama, and the others who had their lands and lived on the\r\nsea-coast.\r\n\r\nIn this state the Governor found affairs when arrived at Xauxa, and,\r\nhaving rested from the long journey without arranging anything in the\r\nfirst few days, he waited for the Indians[86] [for whom he had sent] in\r\norder to go and drive the enemy from the fort which they had made and\r\nfinish with them, when there came to him one of two Spanish messengers\r\nwho had gone to the city of San Miguel to see how things were going\r\nthere, and who spoke to him in this way: \"My lord, when I had set out\r\nfrom here by order of the Marshal, I set myself to journey with all\r\nspeed along the plains and the shore of the sea, not without trouble,\r\nbecause many of the caciques who are along that road were in revolt.\r\nBut some who were friendly provided us with whatever we needed, and they\r\ninformed us that some ships had been seen along the sea-coast, which I\r\nmyself saw one day, and, considering that I was sent to the city of San\r\nMiguel to find out whether the ships of the Adelantado Alvarado or of\r\nother people had arrived, I went [rapidly] along the coast for nine days\r\nand nights, sometimes in sight of them, believing that they would take\r\nport and that I would thus learn who they were. But even with all this\r\nspeed and trouble I could not do what I wished, on which account I made\r\nup my mind to continue my journey to the city of San Miguel, and, having\r\ncrossed to the other side of the large river, I was informed by the\r\nIndians of the country that Christians were coming along that road, and\r\nI, thinking that without doubt it would prove to be the troops of the\r\nAdelantado Alvarado, my companion and I went on our guard in order not\r\nto encounter them _impromptu_.[87] And when they arrived at Motupe, I\r\nlearned that they were near that place [where I was], and I waited for\r\nthe night. At dawn I sent my companion to speak with them, and to see\r\nwhat people they were, and I gave him certain tokens by which he could\r\ninform me, and finally, I learned that they were soldiers who were\r\ncoming to the conquest of these kingdoms. Because of this, I went to\r\nthem and spoke at length, telling them the errand I was on, and they, in\r\nreturn, informed me that they had come to the city of San Miguel in\r\ncertain ships from Panama and were two hundred and fifty in number. When\r\nthey had arrived at San Miguel, the captain who was in that city with\r\ntwo hundred men, seventy of them cavalry, had gone away to the provinces\r\nof Quito in order to conquer them, and they, some thirty persons with\r\ntheir horses, knowing the conquests which were being made in Cuzco, and\r\nthe lack of men there was there, did not wish to go with the captain to\r\nthose provinces of Quito and so were coming to Xauxa. And we gave them\r\nnews of all that had happened here and of the war which we had had with\r\nthe Indians of Quito. And in order to bring more quickly the news of\r\nwhat had happened there I returned from that place without going to the\r\ncity of San Miguel, knowing for certain that the captain would have\r\ndeparted with his men and would already be near Cossibamba.[88] Turning\r\nback on my road, I met, on Easter, the Marshal D. Diego de Almagro near\r\nCena[89] which is where the road to Caxamalca branches off, and to him I\r\nrelated how things were going and how some suspected that the captain\r\nwho was going to Quito was not going with good intentions. As soon as\r\nthe Marshal heard this, he set off in order to catch up with the captain\r\nwho was taking these soldiers on the march to Quito, in order to detain\r\nhim until together they could arrange the necessary provisions for this\r\nwar. This, then, sir, is what has happened to me on this journey, during\r\nwhich I tried to get information about those ships, but could not learn\r\nanything else about them. Of Alvarado nothing more is known than that he\r\nhas already embarked on these shores or has passed further on, as\r\nletters inform me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n    They build a church in the city of Xauxa, and send some three\r\n    thousand Indians with some Spaniards against the hostile Indians.\r\n    They have news of the arrival of many Spaniards and horses, on which\r\n    account they send soldiers to the province of Quito. A Relation of\r\n    the quality and people of the land from Tumbez to Chincha, and of\r\n    the province of Collao and Condisuyo.[90]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Governor received this messenger, read the letters which he brought,\r\nand asked him many other things, and, in order to arrange all that\r\nseemed suitable in this business, he called all the officials of H. M.\r\nAfter they had discussed the journey of that captain to Quito and how\r\nthe Marshal would already have reasoned with him, according to the\r\nreport brought by that messenger, permission was given [to the Governor]\r\nthat he should send one of his lieutenants with sufficient powers for\r\nthe task in hand. And when his letters to the city of San Miguel and to\r\nthe Marshal, in which he told them what was to be done, were written, he\r\nsent off with them three Christians, in order that the letters might go\r\nmore quickly and safely, ordering the men to hasten with all speed upon\r\nthe road and keep advising him of what they learned. After this had been\r\narranged, he [Pizarro] chose the place in which the church was to be\r\nerected in that city of Xauxa. This task he commanded to be done by the\r\ncaciques of the district, and it was built with its great doors of\r\nstone.[91] In the meanwhile, there arrived the four thousand Indian\r\nwarriors whom the cacique had called from Cuzco, and the Governor caused\r\nto be made ready fifty Spanish cavalrymen and thirty peons to go [with\r\nthe Indians] in order to drive the enemy from the pass where they were,\r\nand they set out with the cacique and his soldiers, who loved the\r\nSpaniards better every day.[92] The Governor ordered the captain of\r\nthese Spaniards to pursue the enemy as far as Guanaco[93] and as far\r\nbeyond as he believed necessary, and that he should keep him informed\r\ncontinually, by letters and messengers of what went on. After this, the\r\nGovernor received news of the ships on the feast of the Holy Ghost, and\r\nat the same time, he received a letter from San Miguel which two\r\nSpaniards brought him, and he learned how the ships, because of bad\r\nweather, had remained seventy leagues from Paccacama[94] without being\r\nable to go further, and how the Adelantado de Alvarado had gone up to\r\nPuerto Viejo three months before with four hundred men [on foot] and one\r\nhundred and fifty cavalry[95] and with them he entered the interior in\r\nthe direction of Quito, believing that he would arrive there at the same\r\ntime that the Marshal Don Diego de Almagro would enter those provinces\r\nfrom the other side. As a result of all this information concerning the\r\njustice and government of the city of S. Miguel and of other places, the\r\nGovernor entered upon the control of it [himself]. And, in order to\r\nmend matters, with the consent of the officials, he sent his messengers\r\nin a brigantine by sea, and with them he sent orders to the Marshal\r\nthat, in the name of H. M., he should lend him [Pizarro] aid, and should\r\nconquer, pacify and settle those provinces of Quito with the troops he\r\nhad with him and with those who were in readiness in the city of San\r\nMiguel. At the same time, he arranged other matters in this connection,\r\nso that Alvarado should do no harm in the land, and because H. M. so\r\ndesired that it should be, and likewise he determined that, on the\r\narrival of the ships, he would send a report to H. M. of all that had\r\ntaken place on that venture up to that very hour, so that he [H. M.]\r\nmight be informed of all and might provide in every instance what he\r\nheld to be the best for his royal service. This is the state of the\r\naffairs of war and of other matters in this land: and of the quality of\r\nit I shall speak briefly because a relation of it was sent from\r\nCaxamalca. This land, from Tumbez to Chincha has [a width of some] ten\r\nleagues, in some places more, in others less; it is a broad, flat, sandy\r\nland in which no grass or herbs grow and where it rains but little; it\r\nis [in places] fertile in maize and fruits because the people sow and\r\nirrigate their farms with water from the rivers that come down from the\r\nmountains. The houses which the laborers use are made of rushes and\r\nbranches, because, when it does not rain, it is very hot, and few of the\r\nhouses have roofs.[96] They are a wretched folk, and many of them are\r\nblind on account of the great amount of sand that there is. They are\r\npoor in gold and silver, and what they have is because those who live in\r\nthe sierra exchange it for goods. All the land beside the sea is of this\r\ndescription as far as Chincha, and even fifty leagues beyond there. They\r\ndress in cotton [bambaso] and eat maize both cooked and raw, and\r\nhalf-raw meat. At the end of the plains which are called Ingres are some\r\nvery high mountains which extend from the city of San Miguel as far as\r\nXauxa, and which may well be one hundred and fifty leagues long, but\r\nhave little breadth. It is a very high and rugged land of mountains and\r\nmany rivers; there are no forests save some trees in places where there\r\nis always a thick mist. It is very cold because there is a snow-capped\r\nmountain range which extends from Caxamalca to Xauxa and on which there\r\nis snow all the year through. The people who live there are much more\r\nadvanced than the others, because they are very polished and warlike and\r\nof good dispositions. They are very rich in gold and silver because they\r\nget it from many places in the mountains. None of the lords who have\r\ngoverned these provinces have ever been able to make any use of these\r\ncoast-people, as they are such a wretched and poor folk, as I have said,\r\nthat they are fit to be used for nothing else than to carry fish and\r\nfruits [up into the highlands], for as soon as they come into the\r\nmountainous regions, their own land being very hot, they sicken for the\r\nmost part; and the same thing happens to those who inhabit the\r\nmountains if they go down into the hot country. Those who dwell on the\r\nother side of the land, beyond the summits of the mountains, are like\r\nsavages who have no houses nor any maize save a little; they have very\r\ngreat forests and maintain themselves almost entirely on the fruit of\r\nthe trees; they have no domicile, nor fixed settlements that are known;\r\nthere are very great rivers, and the land is so useless that it paid all\r\nits tribute to the lords in parrot feathers.[97]\r\n\r\nThe mountainous region being the chief part of the country, and being so\r\nnarrow, as well as being torn by the wars that have been there,\r\nsettlements of Christians cannot be made there, for it is a very remote\r\nregion. From the city of Xauxa along the Cuzco road, the country keeps\r\ngetting more shut in by mountains and the distance from the sea is\r\ngreater. And those who have been lords of Cuzco, their own dwelling\r\nbeing in Cuzco, called the rest of the land, in the direction of Quito,\r\nCancasuetio, and the land beyond [Cuzco], called Callao, Collasuyo,\r\nand, in the direction of the sea, Condisuyo, and the interior\r\nCandasuyo;[98] and in this way they gave names to these four provinces,\r\ndisposed like a cross, which contained their empire. In the Collao they\r\nknow not of the sea, and it is a flat land to judge from what has been\r\nseen of it, and it is large and cold, and there are in it many rivers\r\nfrom which gold is got. The Indians say that in the province is a large\r\nlake of fresh water which, in its centre, has two islands.[99] In order\r\nto learn the state of this land and its government, the Governor sent\r\ntwo Christians to bring him a long report of it; they set out in the\r\nbeginning of December. The region of Condisuyo, toward the sea from\r\nCuzco is a small and delectable land, although it is all of forests and\r\nstones, and the inland region is so likewise. Through it [the Antisuyu]\r\nrun all the rivers which do not flow into the western sea. It is a land\r\nof many trees and mountains and is very thinly populated. This sierra\r\nruns from Tumbes as far as Xauxa, and from Xauxa as far as the city of\r\nCuzco. It is stony and rough; if there were not roads made by hand it\r\nwould not be possible to travel on foot, still less on horseback, and\r\nfor the roads there are many houses full of materials for repairing the\r\npavement, and in this matter the lords had so much firmness that there\r\nwas nothing to do but keep it in order.[100] All the mountain\r\nfields[101] are made in the guise of stairways of stone, and the rest of\r\nthe road has no great width because of some mountains that hem it in on\r\nboth sides, and on one side they had made a buttress of stone so that\r\none day it should not slide down [the mountain], and there are,\r\nlikewise, other places, in which the road has a breadth of four or five\r\nhuman bodies, all made and paved with stone. One of the greatest works\r\nthe conquerors saw in this land was these roads. All or most of the\r\npeople on these slopes of the mountains live on high hills and\r\nmountains; their houses are of stone and earth; there are many dwellings\r\nin each village. Along the road each league or two or nearer, are found\r\nthe dwellings built for the purpose of allowing the lords to rest when\r\nthey were out visiting and inspecting their land; and every twenty\r\nleagues there are important cities, heads of provinces, to which the\r\nsmaller cities brought their tribute of maize, clothes and other things.\r\nAll these large cities have storehouses full of the things which are in\r\nthe land, and, because it is very cold but little maize is harvested\r\nexcept in specially assigned places; but [there is plenty of] all the\r\nmany vegetables and roots with which the people sustained themselves,\r\nand also good grass like that of Spain. There are also wild turnips\r\nwhich are bitter. There is a sufficiency of herds of sheep[102] which go\r\nabout in flocks with their shepherds who keep them away from the sown\r\nfields, and they have a certain part of [each] province set apart for\r\nthem to winter in. The people, as I have said, are very polished and\r\nintelligent, and go always clad and shod; they eat maize both cooked and\r\nraw, and drink much chicha, which is a beverage made from maize after\r\nthe fashion of beer. The people are very tractable and very obedient and\r\nyet warlike. They have many arms of diverse sorts, as has been told in\r\nthe relation of the imprisonment of Atabalipa which was sent from\r\nCaxamalca, as was said above.[103]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n    Description of the city of Cuzco and of its wonderful fortress, and\r\n    of the customs of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe city of Cuzco is the principal one of all those where the lords of\r\nthis land have their residence; it is so large and so beautiful that it\r\nwould be worthy of admiration even in Spain; and it is full of the\r\npalaces of the lords, because no poor people live there, and each lord\r\nbuilds there his house, and all the caciques[104] do likewise, although\r\nthe latter do not dwell there continuously. The greater part of these\r\nhouses are of stone, and others have half the façade of stone. There are\r\nmany houses of adobe, and they are all arranged in very good order. The\r\nstreets are laid out at right angles; they are very straight, and are\r\npaved, and down the middle runs a gutter for water lined with stone. The\r\nchief defect which the streets have is that of being narrow, so that\r\nonly one horse and rider can go on one side of the gutter and another\r\nupon the opposite side. This city is located upon the slope of a\r\nmountain, and there are many houses upon the slope and others below on\r\nthe plain. The plaza is rectangular, and the greater part of it is flat\r\nand paved with small stones. Around the plaza are four houses of\r\nnoblemen, who are the chief men of the city; [the houses] are of stone,\r\npainted and carved, and the best of them is the house of\r\nGuaynacaba,[105] a former chief, and the door of it is of marble\r\n[colored] white and red and of other colors;[106] and there are other\r\nvery sightly buildings with flat roofs. There are, in the said city,\r\nmany other buildings and grandeurs. Along the two sides [of the city]\r\npass two rivers which rise a league above Cuzco, and from there down to\r\nthe city and for two leagues below it they run over stone flags so that\r\nthe water may be pure and clear, and so that, though they may rise, they\r\nmay not overflow. They have bridges for those who enter the city. Upon\r\nthe hill which, toward the city, is rounded and very steep, there is a\r\nvery beautiful fortress of earth and stone. Its large windows which look\r\nover the city make it appear still more beautiful.[107] Within, there\r\nare many dwellings, and a chief tower in the centre, built square, and\r\nhaving four or five terraces one above another. The rooms inside are\r\nsmall and the stones of which it is built are very well worked and so\r\nwell adjusted to one another that it does not appear that they have any\r\nmortar and they are so smooth that they look like polished slabs with\r\nthe joinings in regular order and alternating with one another after the\r\nusage in Spain.[108] There are so many rooms and towers that a person\r\ncould not see them all in one day; and many Spaniards who have been in\r\nLombardy and in other foreign kingdoms say that they have never seen any\r\nother fortress like this one nor a stronger castle. Five thousand\r\nSpaniards might well be within it; nor could it be given a broadside or\r\nbe mined, because it is on a rocky mountain. On the side toward the\r\ncity, which is a very steep slope, there is no more than one wall;[109]\r\non the other side, which is less steep, there are three, one above the\r\nother. The most beautiful thing which can be seen in the edifices of\r\nthat land are these walls, because they are of stones so large that\r\nanyone who sees them would not say that they had been put in place by\r\nhuman hands, for they are as large as chunks of mountains and huge\r\nrocks, and they have a height of thirty palms and a length of as many\r\nmore, and others have twenty and twenty-five, and others fifteen, but\r\nthere is none so small that three carts could carry it. These are not\r\nsmooth stones, but rather well joined and matched one with another. The\r\nSpaniards who see them say that neither the bridge of Segovia nor any\r\nother of the edifices which Hercules or the Romans made is so worthy of\r\nbeing seen as this. The city of Tarragona has some works in its walls\r\nmade in this style, but neither so strong nor of such large stones.\r\nThese walls twist in such a way that if they are attacked, it is not\r\npossible to do so from directly in front, but only obliquely.[110] These\r\nwalls are of the same stone, and between wall and wall there is enough\r\nearth to permit three carts to go along the top at one time. They are\r\nmade after the fashion of steps, so that one begins where another leaves\r\noff. The whole fortress was a deposit of arms, clubs, lances, bows,\r\naxes, shields, doublets thickly padded with cotton and other arms of\r\nvarious sorts, and clothes for the soldiers collected here from all\r\nparts of the land subject to the lords of Cuzco. They had many colors,\r\nblue, yellow, brown and many others for painting, much tin and lead with\r\nother metals, and much silver and some gold, many mantles and quilted\r\ndoublets for the warriors. The reason why this fortress contained so\r\nmuch workmanship was that, when this city was founded it was done by a\r\nlord _orejon_[111] who came from Condisuyo, toward the sea, a great\r\nwarrior who conquered this land as far as Bilcas and who, perceiving\r\nthat this was the best place to fix his domicile, founded that city\r\nwith its fortress. And all the other lords who followed after him made\r\nsome improvements in this fortress so that it was ever augmenting in\r\nsize. From this fortress are seen around the city many houses a quarter\r\nof a league, half a league and a league away, and in the valley, which\r\nis surrounded by hills, there are more than five thousand houses, many\r\nof them for the pleasure and recreation of former lords and others for\r\nthe caciques of all the land who dwell continuously in the city. The\r\nothers are storehouses full of mantles, wool, arms, metals, and clothes\r\nand all the things which are grown or made in this land. There are\r\nhouses where the tribute is kept which the vassals bring to the\r\ncaciques; and there is a house where are kept more than a hundred dried\r\nbirds because they make garments of their feathers, which are of many\r\ncolors, and there are many houses for this [work]. There are bucklers,\r\noval shields made of leather, beams for roofing the houses, knives and\r\nother tools, sandals and breast-plates for the warriors in such great\r\nquantity that the mind does not cease to wonder how so great a tribute\r\nof so many kinds of things can have been given. Each dead lord has here\r\nhis house and all that was paid to him as tribute during his life, for\r\nno lord who succeeds another [and this is the law among them] can, after\r\nthe death of the last one, take possession of his inheritance. Each one\r\nhas his service of gold and of silver, and his things and clothes for\r\nhimself, and he who follows takes nothing from him. The caciques and\r\nlords maintain their houses of recreation with the corresponding staff\r\nof servants and women who sow their fields with maize and place a little\r\nof it in their sepulchres. They adore the sun and have built many\r\ntemples to him, and of all the things which they have, as much of\r\nclothes as of maize and other things, they offer some to the sun, of\r\nwhich the warriors later avail themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n    Of the province of the Collao and of the qualities and customs of\r\n    its people, and of the rich gold mines that are found there.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two Christians who were sent to see the province of the Collao were\r\nforty days upon their journey, and, as soon as they had returned to\r\nCuzco where the governor was, they gave him news and a report of all\r\nthat they had seen and learned, which is set forth below. The land of\r\nthe Collao is far off and a long way from the sea, so much so that the\r\nnatives who inhabit it, have no knowledge of it. The sierra is very high\r\nand rather broad, and with all this, it is excessively cold. There are\r\nin the region no groves or woods, nor is there any wood for burning, and\r\nwhat little there is in use there comes from trade, in exchange for\r\nmerchandise, with those who live near the sea and are called Ingres,\r\nand also with those who live below near the rivers, for these people\r\nhave fire-wood and they exchange it for sheep[112] and other animals and\r\nvegetables, since, for the most part, the land is sterile, and all the\r\npeople live on roots, herbs, maize and sometimes flesh, not because\r\nthere is not, in that province of the Collao, a good quantity of sheep,\r\nbut because the people are so much the subjects of the lord to whom they\r\nare bound to give obedience that, without his licence or that of the\r\nchief or governor who, by his command, is in the country, they do not\r\nkill one [llama], nor do even the lords and caciques dare to kill any\r\nwithout such permission. The land is well populated because wars have\r\nnot destroyed it as they have other provinces. The villages are of\r\nordinary size and their houses are small, with walls of stone and adobe\r\nmixed and covered with roofs of straw. The grass which grows in this\r\nland is short and sparse. There are some rivers, although of small\r\nvolume. In the middle of the province there is a great lake, in length\r\nalmost one hundred leagues, and the most thickly peopled land is around\r\nits shore; in the middle of the lake there are two islets, and on one of\r\nthem is a mosque and house of the sun which is held in great veneration,\r\nand to it they come to make their offerings and sacrifices on a great\r\nstone on the island which they call Tichicasa[113] which either because\r\nthe devil hides himself there and speaks to them or because of an\r\nancient custom, or on account of some other cause that has never been\r\nmade clear, all the people of that province hold in great esteem, and\r\nthey offer there gold, silver and other things. There are more than six\r\nhundred Indians serving in this place, and more than a thousand women\r\nwho make chicha in order to throw it upon that stone Tichicasa.[114] The\r\nrich mines of that province of the Collao are beyond this lake [in a\r\nregion] called Chuchiabo.[115] The mines are in the gorge [caja-chiusa]\r\nof a river, about half-way up the sides. They are made like caves, by\r\nwhose mouths they enter to scrape the earth, and they scrape it with\r\nthe horns of deer and they carry it outside in certain hides sewn into\r\nthe form of sacks or of wine-skins of sheep-hide. The manner in which\r\nthey wash it is that they take from the river a [jet?][116] of water,\r\nand on the bank they set up certain very smooth flag-stones on which\r\nthey throw the water, after which they draw off by a duct the water of\r\nthe [jet?] which has just fallen down [upon the gold-earth?], and the\r\nwater carries off the earth little by little so that the gold is left\r\nupon the flag-stones themselves, and in this manner they collect it. The\r\nmines go far into the earth, one ten brazas, another twenty, and the\r\ngreatest mine, which is called Guarnacabo[117] goes into the earth some\r\nforty brazas.[118] They have no light, nor are they broader than is\r\nnecessary for one person to enter crouching down, and until the man who\r\nis in the mine comes out, no other can go in. The people who get out the\r\ngold here are as many as fifty,[119] counting men and women, and these\r\nare all of this land, and from one cacique come twenty, from another\r\nfifty, from another thirty, and from others more or less according to\r\nthe number that they have, and they take out gold for the chief lord,\r\nand they have taken such precautions in the matter that in nowise can\r\nany of what is taken out be stolen, because they have placed guards\r\naround the mines so that none of those who take out the gold can get\r\naway without being seen. At night, when they return to their houses in\r\nthe village, they enter by a gate where the overseers are who have the\r\ngold in their charge, and from each person they receive the gold that he\r\nhas got. There are other mines beyond these, and there are still others\r\nscattered about through the land which are like wells a man's height in\r\ndepth, so that the worker can just throw the earth from below on top of\r\nthe ground. And when they dig them so deep that they cannot throw the\r\nearth out on top, they leave them and make new wells.[120] But the\r\nrichest mines, and the ones from which the most gold is got, are the\r\nfirst, which do not have the inconvenience of washing the earth, and,\r\nbecause of the cold, they do not work those mines more than four months\r\nof the year, [and then only] from the hour of noon to nearly\r\nsunset.[121] The people are very mild, and so accustomed to serve, that\r\nall that has to be done in the land they do themselves, and so it is, in\r\nthe roads and in the houses which the chief lord commands them to build,\r\nand they continually offer themselves for work and for carrying the\r\nburdens of the warriors when the lord goes to some place [in the\r\nregion]. The Spaniards took from those mines a load of earth and carried\r\nit to Cuzco without doing anything else. It was washed by the hand of\r\nthe Governor after the Spaniards had sworn that they had not placed the\r\ngold in it or done anything to it save take it from the mine as the\r\nIndians did who washed it, and from it three pesos of gold was got. All\r\nthose who understand mines and the getting of gold, being informed of\r\nthe manner in which it is got in this land, say that all the [country\r\nis full of mines], and that if the Spaniards gave implements and skill\r\n[in using them] to the Indians so that it might be got out, much gold\r\nwould be taken from the earth, and it is believed that when this time\r\nhas arrived, a year will not go by in which a million of gold is not\r\ngot. The people of this province, as well men as women, are very filthy,\r\nand they have large hands, and the province is very large.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n    Of the great veneration in which the Indians held Guarnacaba[122]\r\n    when he lived[123] and of that in which they hold him now, after\r\n    death. And how, through the disunion of the Indians, the Spaniards\r\n    entered Cuzco, and of the fidelity of the new cacique\r\n    Guarnacaba[124] to the Christians.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe city of Cuzco is the head and principal province of all the others,\r\nand from here to the beach of San Mateo and, in the other direction, to\r\nbeyond the province of Collao, which is entirely a land of arrow-using\r\nsavages, all is subject to one single lord who was Atabalipa, and,\r\nbefore him, to the other by-gone lords, and at present the lord of all\r\nis this son of Guarnacaba. This Guarnacaba, who was so renowned and\r\nfeared, and is so even to this day, although he is dead, was very much\r\nbeloved by his vassals, and subjected great provinces, and made them\r\nhis tributaries. He was well obeyed and almost worshipped, and his body\r\nis in the city of Cuzco, quite whole, enveloped in rich cloths and\r\nlacking only the tip of the nose. There are other images of plaster of\r\nclay which have only the hair and nails which were cut off in life and\r\nthe clothes that were worn, and these images are as much venerated by\r\nthose people as if they were their gods. Frequently they take the [body]\r\nout into the plaza with music and dancing, and they always stay close to\r\nit, day and night, driving away the flies. When some important lords\r\ncome to see the cacique, they go first to salute these figures, and they\r\nthen go to the cacique and hold, with him, so many ceremonies that it\r\nwould be a great prolixity to describe them. So many people assemble at\r\nthese feasts, which are held in that plaza, that their number exceeds\r\none hundred thousand souls. It turned out to be fortunate that they [the\r\nSpaniards] had made that son of Guarnacaba lord, because all the\r\ncaciques and lords of the land and of remote provinces came to serve\r\nhim and, out of respect for him, to yield obedience to the Emperor. The\r\nconquerors passed through great trials, because all the land is the most\r\nmountainous and roughest that can be traversed on horseback, and it may\r\nbe believed that, had it not been for the discord which existed between\r\nthe people of Quito and those of Cuzco and its neighbourhood, the\r\nSpaniards would never have entered Cuzco, nor would there have been\r\nenough of them to get beyond Xauxa, and in order to enter they would\r\nhave had to go in a force of five hundred, and, to maintain themselves,\r\nthey would have needed many more, because the land is so large and so\r\nrough that there are mountains and passes that ten men could defend\r\nagainst ten thousand. And the Governor never thought of being able to go\r\nwith less than five hundred Christians to conquer, pacify, and make a\r\ntributary of it. But as he learned of the great disunion that existed\r\nbetween the people of that land [Cuzco] and those of Quito, it was\r\nproposed that he should go with the few Christians that he had to\r\ndeliver them from subjection and servitude, and to put a stop to the\r\nmischief and wrongs that those of Quito were doing in that land, and Our\r\nLord saw fit to favor him [in it]. Nor would the Governor ever have\r\nventured to make so long and toilsome a journey in this great\r\nundertaking had it not been for the great confidence which he had in all\r\nthe Spaniards of his company through having tried them out and having\r\nlearned that they were dextrous and skilled in so many conquests and\r\naccustomed to these lands and to the toils of war. All of this they\r\nshowed themselves to be in this journey through rains and snows, in\r\nswimming across many rivers, in crossing great mountain chains and in\r\nsleeping many nights in the open air without water to drink and without\r\nanything on which to feed, and always, day and night, having to be armed\r\nand on guard, in going, at the end of the war, to reduce many caciques\r\nand lands which had rebelled, and in going from Xauxa to Cuzco, on which\r\njourney they suffered, with their governor, so many trials and on which\r\nthey so often placed their lives in peril in rivers and mountains where\r\nmany horses were killed by falling headlong. This son of Guarnacaba has\r\nmuch friendship and concord with the Christians, and for this reason, in\r\norder to preserve him in the lordship, the Spaniards put themselves to\r\ninfinite pains and likewise bore themselves in all these undertakings so\r\nvalorously, and suffered so much, just as other Spaniards have been able\r\nto do in the service of the Emperor, that, as a result, the very\r\nSpaniards who have found themselves in this undertaking, marvel at what\r\nthey have done when once more they set themselves to think upon it, and\r\nthey do not know how they come to be alive as they have been able to\r\nsuffer so many trials and such prolonged hunger. But they hold that all\r\n[their troubles] were put to a good use, and they would again offer\r\nthemselves, were it necessary, to enter upon the greatest wearinesses\r\nfor the conversion of those people and the exaltation of our holy\r\ncatholic faith. Of the greatness and situation of the aforesaid land, I\r\nomit to speak, and it only remains to give thanks and praises to Our\r\nLord because, so obviously, he has wished to guide with his hand the\r\naffairs of H. M. and of these kingdoms which, by his divine providence,\r\nhave been illumined and directed upon the true road of salvation. May he\r\nbend his infinite goodness so that henceforth the [kingdoms] may go from\r\ngood to better by the intercession of his blessed Mother, the advocate\r\nof all our steps who directs them to a good end.\r\n\r\nThis relation was finished in the city of Xauxa on the 15th day of the\r\nmonth of July, 1534. And I, Pero Sancho, Scrivener general of these\r\nkingdoms of New Castile and secretary of the governor Francisco Pizarro,\r\nby his order and that of the officials of H. M. wrote it just as things\r\nhappened, and when it was finished I read it in the presence of the\r\ngovernor and of the officials of H. M., and, as it was all true, they\r\nsaid governor and officials of H. M. sign it with their hand.\r\n\r\n                   FRANCISCO PIZARRO\r\n          ALVARO RIQUELME.

This remarkable Indian general\r\nwas a son of Epiclachima, younger brother of Cacha, last Caran Scyri of\r\nQuito. Cacha was conquered by Huayna Capac about 1487, and Calicuchima\r\nentered the service of Atahualpa who was his kinsman through Paccha his\r\ncousin, Huayna Capac's wife. (Velasco.)\r\n\r\n[7] Something lacking in the text.\r\n\r\n[8] _Caribes_, in Spanish, sometimes means the Carib people; here,\r\nsimply savages.\r\n\r\n[9] In the text of Ramusio, _Se gli diede una storta col mangano al\r\ncollo_.\r\n\r\n[10] This name is, of course, an error.\r\n\r\n[11] Gucunacaba is Huayna Capac. He left three legitimate sons beside\r\nHuascar, viz., Manco, Paullu, and Titu Atauchi. I do not know which of\r\nthem was Sancho's \"Atabalipa\" number two. See Sarmiento, 1907, p. xvii.\r\n\r\n[12] Cuzcos = Incas.\r\n\r\n[13] Probably Huascar.\r\n\r\n[14] Huamachuco.\r\n\r\n[15] Andamarca.\r\n\r\n[16] Huaylas.\r\n\r\n[17] Cajatambo.\r\n\r\n[18] Icazbalceta suggests that this place is Cajamarquilla. I do not\r\nagree with this opinion, because Cajamarquilla had long been in ruins\r\nwhen the Spaniards arrived. (Cf. Hodge, 1897, pp. 304 ff.) It was\r\nprobably Chacamarca, (see below).\r\n\r\n[19] San Miguel de Piura.\r\n\r\n[20] San Miguel was founded first at another site which, on being found\r\nto be unhealthy, was deserted; San Miguel was soon refounded at Piura.\r\n(Cf. Prescott, Bk. III, Cap. III, Moses, 1914, vol. I, p. 99.) It is\r\npossible that the \"captain\" mentioned here was no other than Sebastian\r\nde Belalcazar or Benalcazar who later conquered Quito. (Cf. Moses, 1914,\r\nI, p. 106.)\r\n\r\n[21] This is obviously a mistake.\r\n\r\n[22] Descriptions of Inca bridges will be found at:\r\n\r\n    Garcilasso, 1859, I, pp. 253 ff., 260.\r\n    Cieza de Leon, 1864, pp. 314-315.\r\n    Joyce, 1912, pp. 142-143.\r\n    Beuchat, 1912, pp. 608, 650.\r\n    Pinkerton, 1808-1814, XIV, p. 530. (Picture.)\r\n\r\n[23] Pachacamac has often been described. See especially Uhle, 1903; and\r\nEstete, 1872; and Markham, 1912, pp. 232 ff.\r\n\r\n[24] Cajatambo.\r\n\r\n[25] Pambo = Pombo = Pumpu.\r\n\r\n[26] It is impossible to tell what the correct names of these personages\r\nmay have been.\r\n\r\n[27] Pombo = Pambo = Pumpu.\r\n\r\n[28] Chacamarca. See Raimondi's map, 1875.\r\n\r\n[29] The Spanish here is very prolix. I have given an approximate and\r\nshorter phraseology.\r\n\r\n[30] This may be the \"Tice\" mentioned in Section II, under another name.\r\nBut all Sancho's proper names are in great confusion.\r\n\r\n[31] It is barely possible that \"Aticoc\" may be an attempt at Titu\r\nAtauchi.\r\n\r\n[32] The candor or barefacedness with which the secretary, Sancho,\r\nconfesses and even applauds the bad faith of Pizarro in various places\r\nin this narrative, which he wrote by order of Pizarro, is worthy of\r\nadmiration.--Note by Icazbalceta.\r\n\r\n[33] The original: _che haurebbe dato rame che i Capitani etc., soldati\r\nfossero venuti alla pase_. The significance of the word _rame_ is\r\nobscure; as at times it means _money_, whence comes the vulgar phrase\r\n_questo sa di rame_, in order to indicate that a thing is dear, it\r\nappeared to me that I might adopt the interpretation which I give,\r\nalthough I am not satisfied with it.--Note by Icazbalceta. The present\r\ntranslator has translated the Spanish as given by Icazbalceta.\r\n\r\n[34] The original; _veduto_ appears to me an error for\r\n_venuto_.--Icazbalceta.\r\n\r\n[35] Inca \"roads\" were designed for foot traffic, and steps were the\r\nmeans used for going up slopes.\r\n\r\n[36] Parcostambo.\r\n\r\n[37] Vilcas.\r\n\r\n[38] All within the parentheses is a reconstruction of the evident sense\r\nrather than a translation.\r\n\r\n[39] Cf. Bandelier, 1910, p. 61.\r\n\r\n[40] _Serrata_ means either _espesura_ [thicket] or _angostura_ [cleft].\r\n\r\n[41] Quizquiz, like Chalicuchima, had been a general of Atahualpa before\r\nthe coming of the Spaniards. He fought long against the invaders, but at\r\nlength his unavailing efforts caused him to be murdered by his own\r\nfollowers. See Garcilasso, II, p. 509; Sarmiento, 171-173; Cieza de\r\nLeon, Chr., Pt. II, pp. 164 and 227; Markham, 1912, pp. 247-251.\r\n\r\n[42] Andahuaylas.\r\n\r\n[43] Curamba.\r\n\r\n[44] Andahuaylas.\r\n\r\n[45] Vilcas.\r\n\r\n[46] Curamba is the correct form for Airamba (given above).\r\n\r\n[47] Vilcas, sometimes called Vilcashuaman, was a part of the territory\r\ncontrolled by the Chanca before they were made subjects to Cuzco. The\r\nconquest of the Chanca may have begun in the time of Rocca, but it had\r\nits culmination in that of Viracocha. Tupac Yupanqui built numerous\r\ntemples and palaces there, and the region round about Vilcas was\r\ntraversed by important roads or trails. It is a place that is mentioned\r\nby nearly all the early writers. Cf. Garcilasso, I, pp. 324-326, II, p.\r\n58; Cieza de Leon, I, 312-315, II, 150-154; Joyce, 1912, p. 107;\r\nMarkham, 1912, p. 178.\r\n\r\n[48] Sancho is vague in his use of the words _caballo_ and _ligero\r\ncaballo_. The latter means \"light horse\" or \"light-armed cavalry.\" But\r\nhe uses the word _caballo_ when he means _caballero_. In the present\r\ninstance he really means _caballo_.\r\n\r\n[49] The veracity of this story is certainly open to question.\r\n\r\n[50] Here the text says _caballos_, although it is plain that\r\n_caballeros_ is the word intended.\r\n\r\n[51] See Squier, 1877, p. 177; Cieza, Tr. p. 355; Velasco, 1840, p. 22;\r\nJoyce, 1912, pp. 210-212.\r\n\r\n[52] This speech can hardly be regarded as verbatim, of course.\r\n\r\n[53] Sancho's imagination was drawn upon throughout this section.\r\n\r\n[54] Limatambo (correctly, Rimactampu).\r\n\r\n[55] Xaquixaguana or Sacsahuana.\r\n\r\n[56] The text has: \"_y que riendo el Gobernador partirse sin aguardar a\r\nque pasaran los indios amigos, ..._\"\r\n\r\n[57] _tuvieron tiempo de retraerse al monte_ really means, \"they had\r\ntime to withdraw to the mountain,\" but the obvious sense is better\r\npreserved in the translation I have given.\r\n\r\n[58] Possibly this means Huascar, whom Atahualpa had caused to be put to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n[59] In Spanish they always say \"el Cuzco.\" I believe that the reason\r\nfor this is that \"Cuzco\" comes from a Quichua word meaning \"navel.\" If\r\nthis is so, \"el Cuzco\" has the significance of \"the Navel\" (of the\r\nWorld). In English, of course, we use the word simply as a place-name.\r\n\r\n[60] The official designation of the Emperor was: S. C. C. M., or\r\nSagrada Cesarea Catolica Majestad.\r\n\r\n[61] The modern village of Limatambo. When I was there the fine walls so\r\noften spoken of were in a bad condition from neglect on the part of the\r\nnatives. Yet, in spite of the refuse piled around them and the throngs\r\nof pigs all about, one could see that the masonry was of the finest\r\nCyclopean type. Cf. Squier, 1877, p. 535; Markham, 1912, pp. 286 and\r\n319; Cieza, Tr., p. 320; Sarmiento, pp. 119 and 209. Garcilasso tells us\r\nthat it was founded by Manco Capac and that it was the place where\r\nViracocha waited for the Chanca. Garcilasso, I, p. 80, and II, p. 52.\r\n\r\n[62] Now called Zurite. It was the site of a palace of Viracocha, who\r\nadded it to his realm once more by a victory (won by Pachacutec) over\r\nthe Chanca. Cf. Sarmiento, p. 85; Garcilasso, I, p. 53; Cieza, Chr., p.\r\n128; The \"Finca de los Andenes\" is doubtless the site of the palace.\r\n\r\n[63] The truth of this statement is very questionable.\r\n\r\n[64] Valverde.\r\n\r\n[65] Pachacamac.\r\n\r\n[66] In the days before the Incas the Creator-God (under the names of\r\nPachacamac, Viracocha, Irma, etc.) was worshipped without idols. He was\r\nconceived as being superior to all other gods and as being invisible.\r\nTo judge from all accounts, his cult, at this stage, was an advanced\r\ntype of religion. Later, however, the custom of having idols sprang up.\r\nAs their attributes were the same, there can be but little doubt that\r\nPachacamac and Viracocha were the same deity. Pachacamac's chief shrine\r\nwas on the coast, at Pachacamac. Inca Pachacutec conquered Cuismancu,\r\nlord of Pachacamac, about 1410, and built a Sun Temple there. The chief\r\ntemple to Viracocha was at Cacha south of Cuzco, and it was probably\r\nerected by the Inca Viracocha to celebrate his defeat of the Chanca\r\nconfederacy. Both these temples (under Inca influence) had idols. Cf.\r\nBlas Valera, 1879, pp. 137-140; Sarmiento, pp. 28-29; Garcilasso, II,\r\npp. 69, 185-193, 428, 460; Cieza, Tr., pp. 161-163, 251-254; Cobo, 1892,\r\nIII, pp. 320-323; Uhle, 1903; Markham, 1912, pp. 41, 97, 181, 233-234;\r\nJoyce, 1912, pp. 150-152; Beuchat, 1912, pp. 615-616.\r\n\r\n[67] Another obvious fabrication.\r\n\r\n[68] Huayna Capac, ruled ca. 1500-1525.\r\n\r\n[69] This was Manco Inca, a son of Huayna Capac by his third wife. Manco\r\ndied in 1544, leaving a grand-daughter, Coya Beatriz, who married Don\r\nMartin Garcia Loyola. Their daughter, Lorenza, became Marquesa de\r\nOropesa.--Note by Sir C. R. M. Cf. Garcilasso, II, pp. 352 and 526.\r\n\r\n[70] A half-brother only.\r\n\r\n[71] The story of Manco Inca is one of the most pathetic in South\r\nAmerican history. Although our author describes some of the events in\r\nthe young Inca's life, I will give a brief résumé of it here.\r\n\r\nManco was \"crowned\" with the _borla_ or fringe on March 24, 1534, at\r\nCuzco. To please him, Almagro the elder killed his two brothers (who\r\nmight have become his rivals) in order to get Manco on his side in the\r\nquarrel which he had with the Pizarros as to which ought to control\r\nCuzco. After Almagro went to Chile, the _Villac Umu_ (High Priest) urged\r\nhis brother Manco to rise in revolt against the Spaniards, who were\r\ndivided among themselves. On April 18, 1536, Manco revolted at Yucay. He\r\nlaid siege to Cuzco with a very large force and attacked the small\r\nSpanish garrison mercilessly, setting fire to the roofs of houses by\r\nmeans of arrows tipped with blazing tow and otherwise harassing them.\r\nThe Inca and his forces were, for a time, successful. They captured the\r\ngreat fortress of Sacsahuaman, which was, however, retaken by Juan\r\nPizarro and Gonzalo Pizarro. Disheartened by this, the Inca retired to\r\nthe fortress of Ollantaytampu, where he successfully combatted the\r\nattempts of Hernando Pizarro to capture him. Later, Manco was forced by\r\nOrgoñez to withdraw to the mountainous region of Vilcapampa. The last\r\nInca capital was set up at Viticos, and there Manco held his court for\r\nseveral years. He often raided the Spanish travellers between Cuzco and\r\nLima. His court became a place of refuge for all Spaniards who fell out\r\nwith their fellows. One of these refugees, Gomez Perez, either killed\r\nManco himself in a brawl over a game of quoits or helped to kill him as\r\nthe result of a plot. The Inca, at all events, was murdered by Spaniards\r\nwhom he had befriended. That was in 1544. In 1911 Professor Hiram\r\nBingham visited Vitcos the situation of which is clearly shown on the\r\nmap, dated 1907, that accompanies Sir Clements Markham's translation of\r\nSarmiento and Ocampo (Hakluyt, 2d Series, no. XXII, p. 203). Professor\r\nBingham's description of the site is adequate, and, I think, unique.\r\n\r\nAt about the same time as the siege of Cuzco, another Inca force, led by\r\nTitu Yupanqui, marched on the newly founded Spanish capital (the Ciudad\r\nde los Reyes or Lima). It was driven off by the Marques Francisco\r\nPizarro.\r\n\r\nA brother of Manco, Paullu, was christened under the name of Don\r\nCristoval Paullu. He lived in the Colcampata palace (which had been the\r\ngreat Pachacutec's), and the small church of San Cristoval was built\r\nnear at hand for his use. He died about 1550, being survived by Sayri\r\nTupac, Cusi Titu Yupanqui, and two other children of Manco (who all\r\nlived on at Viticos) and by his own sons Carlos and Felipe. It was on\r\nthe occasion of a particular request made by the Viceroy, Don Andres\r\nHurtado de Mendoza, Marqués de Cañete, that Sayri Tupac's aunt, Princess\r\nBeatriz, successfully urged him to come and live in Cuzco. Sayri Tupac\r\ndied in 1560. Cf.

It is hardly necessary to say that Prescott's is the correct\r\none.\r\n\r\n[74] Here, it is not difficult to read between the lines and see what\r\nsort of treatment Manco got.\r\n\r\n[75] Vicente de Valverde.\r\n\r\n[76] An involved and unimportant clause here.\r\n\r\n[77] This is all for the benefit of the Emperor, whose policy it was to\r\ndeal fairly by his new subjects.\r\n\r\n[78] Vilcas.\r\n\r\n[79] I do not know who is meant by this name.\r\n\r\n[80] Llamas.\r\n\r\n[81] Possibly these figures were the embalmed bodies of the coyacuna or\r\n\"queens\" which, according to Garcilasso, were placed in Curicancha--the\r\nSun Temple.\r\n\r\n[82] _en su mismo ser_.\r\n\r\n[83] _Casa_ really means house.\r\n\r\n[84] \"Che vi corcorsero assai in tre anni,\" says the original, which can\r\nonly be translated as I have done it above. But when the secretary wrote\r\nhis relation, no such three years had gone by since the foundation of\r\nCuzco, but only four months, so it is necessary to suppose that the\r\nItalian translator did not understand his original well, _or_ that it is\r\nan interpolation made later on.--Note by Icazbalceta.\r\n\r\n[85] The civilized inhabitants of the Chilca region came originally from\r\nthe interior, probably from the Yauyos region. This event occurred,\r\npresumably, somewhere about 800-900 of our era, for, by the time the\r\nIncas were founding Cuzco (ca. 1100), they found themselves strong\r\nenough to make raids into the interior. Joyce points out that these\r\nraids may have occurred even earlier, at a time when the Tiahuanacu\r\nempire still flourished. At any rate, there was an important contact\r\nwith the interior cultures at an early date. The Chincha also were\r\nconstantly at war with the Chimu, Chuquimancu and Cuismancu who each\r\nruled large and civilized coast states. The Chincha were conquered by\r\nthe Inca either in the reign of Pachacutec or in that of Tupac Yupanqui\r\n(more probably the former) somewhere about 1450. According to Estete,\r\ntheir ruler (under Inca tutelage) in the time of the Conquest was\r\nTamviambea. The cultural development of the Chincha was, artistically\r\nspeaking, not so high as that of the Chimu. It was, however, in pre-Inca\r\ntimes, relatively complex. They practised trephining successfully (an\r\nart derived from their Yauyu ancestors), and they also frequently\r\nindulged in the anterio-posterior type of cranial deformation. Their\r\ngeneral physical condition was good. They numbered about 25,000. Cf.\r\nCieza, Tr., p. 228; Garcilasso, II, pp. 146-149; Joyce, 1912, pp. 95,\r\n187; Markham, 1912, pp. 237-239; Tello, 1912; Hrdlicka, 1914, pp. 22-24;\r\nLafone-Quevedo, 1912, p. 115.\r\n\r\n[86] This may have been the chief Taurichumbi mentioned by Estete. Cf.\r\nMarkham, 1912, p. 239.\r\n\r\n[87] This was before Alvarado and Pizarro met and came to an agreement.\r\n\r\n[88] Possibly Riobamba, Tumebamba, or some other place in the \"Kingdom\"\r\nof Quito.\r\n\r\n[89] Probably Saña.\r\n\r\n[90] Properly Colla-suyu and Cunti-suyu, i.e. the Southern province and\r\nthe Western province of Ttahuan-tin-suyu.\r\n\r\n[91] Jauja (or Xauxa) was the predecessor of la Ciudad de los Reyes. A\r\nletter to Charles V, dated July 20, 1534, describes it thus: \"Esta\r\nCibdad es la mexor y mayor quen la Tierra se ha vista, e aun en\r\n_Indias_; e decimos a Vuestra Magestad ques tan hermosa e de tan buenos\r\nedyficios quen _España_ seria muy de ver; tiene las calles por mucho\r\nconcierto empedradas de guixas pequenas; todas las mas de las casas son\r\nde señores prencipales fechas de canteria; esta en una ladera de un\r\ncerro, en el qual sobrel pueblo esta una fortaleza muy bien obrada de\r\ncanteria tan de ver, que por españoles que an andado Reinos extranos,\r\ndizen no aber visto otro edyficio igual al della; ...\" Cf. Cabildos,\r\nIII, pp. 4-5.\r\n\r\n[92] The Italian is: \"_Il quale tuttavia piu veniua ponendo amore a gli\r\nSpagnuoli._\"--Note by Icazbalceta.\r\n\r\n[93] Huanuco.\r\n\r\n[94] Pachacamac.\r\n\r\n[95] Prescott places the total at 500 of which 230 were cavalry. Cf.\r\nPrescott, Bk. III, Cap. 9.\r\n\r\n[96] It seems to me that, even in the days of the Chimu and the Inca,\r\nthe poorer people must have lived in this sort of hut-like houses, and\r\nthat only the great dwelt in the \"palaces\" whose ruins are so\r\nremarkable. Such a state of things would explain the apparent\r\nimpossibility of a large population existing in the dwellings we now\r\nsee. Cf. Hodge, 1897.\r\n\r\n[97] This montaña is to-day the richest and most valuable part of Peru.\r\n\r\n[98] According to Garcilasso, Lib. II, Cap. 11, the Peruvian empire was\r\ndivided into four parts, Cuzco being considered the centre. They called\r\nthe northern part Chinchasuya, the southern Coyasuya, the western\r\nCuntisuya, and the eastern Antisuyu.--Note by Icazbalceta.\r\n\r\n[99] Lake Titicaca contains several islands, notably Titicaca and Coati.\r\n\r\n[100] An obscure passage translated merely in most general terms.\r\n\r\n[101] _Agras_ I take to mean fields from its similarity to the Latin\r\nword, _ager_.\r\n\r\n[102] Llamas.\r\n\r\n[103] At this point Ramusio gives a fanciful view of the city of Cuzco,\r\nwhich has no real interest whatever.--Note by Icazbalceta.\r\n\r\n[104] _Cacique_ is really a West Indies word. The early Spanish writers\r\nare wont to apply it to any sort of native official. Here, no doubt, the\r\ncorrect term would be the Quichua word _Curaca_. Officials thus\r\ndesignated under the Inca dominion were the hereditary chiefs of\r\nformerly independent tribes and territories--roughly analogous to the\r\nmediatized princes of Europe. Though made vassals of the Inca, the\r\n_curacas_ were often continued in the command of their former subjects\r\nand were intrusted with the governorship of provinces over which they\r\nwere formerly sovereigns. The _curacas_ ranked immediately below the\r\nInca caste, and ruled what was known as a _hunu_. Sometimes a _curaca_\r\nwas made an Inca-by-privilege as a reward of services.\r\n\r\n[105] Huayna Capac.\r\n\r\n[106] The marble was really granite. No marble was used by the Incas.\r\n\r\n[107] This reference to windows is important. At the outset we must\r\nremind ourselves that Sancho may have confused _windows_ and _niches_.\r\nIt is entirely possible, however, that windows may formerly have been\r\npresent in those walls of Sacsahuaman. As is well known, windows and\r\nniches were distinguishing features of Inca architecture during the\r\nlater period of that dynasty. Sites like Pissac, Limatambo, Yucay,\r\nQuente, Vilcabamba (alias Machu Pichu, a post-conquest site in part),\r\nand Huaman-marca in the Amaybamba Valley all present one or both of\r\nthese features, and all present unmistakable signs of recent\r\nconstruction, say from the reign of Viracocha (circa 1425-50) onward.\r\nThe importance of this mention of windows (or niches) lies in this: It\r\ngives strong evidence in support of my belief that the walls of\r\nSacsahuaman which are toward Cuzco were of Inca construction. Garcilasso\r\n(II, pp. 305 ff.) attempts to give the credit for the whole of\r\nSacsahuaman to Inca Yupanqui, and ignores the fact that the cyclopean\r\nwalls on the north side of the hill undoubtedly date, as do \"the seats\r\nof the Inca\" close at hand, from the days of Tiahuanaco. When we see the\r\nstatement made that the fortress of Sacsahuaman was of Inca construction\r\nwe must remember that really only the southern walls and a few buildings\r\nbehind them were built under the Incas.\r\n\r\n[108] That is, the joints do not come above one another, but are\r\nalternated, as in brick-work.\r\n\r\n[109] There are really six walls on the south and three on the north.\r\nCf. Garcilasso, II, 305.\r\n\r\n[110] This is a poor attempt to describe the entrant and re-entrant\r\nangles that make the cyclopean walls so remarkable from a military point\r\nof view. See the plan by Squier and Davis, Garcilasso, II, p. 305.\r\n\r\n[111] Orejon, lit. \"large-ear\"; i.e. a member of the Inca clan\r\nprivileged to distend his ears by means of ear-plugs. This myth of the\r\nfounding of Cuzco by a man from the sea is not found elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[112] Llamas.\r\n\r\n[113] Titicaca.\r\n\r\n[114] Cobo describes the Temple of the Sun on Titicaca and that of the\r\nMoon on Coati as being, together, the third most important sanctuary in\r\nthe Inca dominion. The other two, of course, were the temples in Cuzco\r\nand Pachacamac. For a detailed description of the temples in Lake\r\nTiticaca see Cobo, IV, pp. 54-63 and Bandelier, 1910. The structures at\r\nthat point are all of late-Inca construction and seem to have been built\r\nafter the Inca conceived the idea of making himself out to be the \"Son\r\nof the Sun.\" They were perhaps built with a view to lending colour to\r\nthe myth.\r\n\r\n[115] Correctly, Chuqui-apu.\r\n\r\n[116] The original _una seriola_ is a word whose meaning I have not been\r\nable to find. It is found again a little below. The method the Indians\r\nhad for washing the earth and getting the gold can be seen in Oviedo,\r\nHistoria General de las Indias, Parte I, lib. 6, Cap. 8.--Note by\r\nIcazbalceta.\r\n\r\n[117] Huayna Capac.\r\n\r\n[118] A braza is six feet.\r\n\r\n[119] It says this in the original, but it is an error, for it will be\r\nseen that the number must have been much greater.--Note by Icazbalceta.\r\n\r\n[120] As the text of this passage is obscure I give it here: _...\r\nprofundos como de la altura de un hombre, en cuanto pueda el de abajo\r\ndar la tierra al de arriba; y cuando los cavan tanto que ya el de arriba\r\nno puede alcanzarla, lo dejan asi, y se van a hacer otros pozos ..._\r\n\r\n[121] Here is another rather obscure passage: \"_... pero e pui ricche\r\n... sono le prime che non hanno caricho da lauar la terra & per rispetto\r\ndel freddo & delle mine que vi e non lo cauano. &c._\" Oviedo (Hist.\r\nGeneral, Parte I, lib. 6, Cap. 8); Acosta (Hist. nat. y mor. de las\r\nInd., lib. 4, Cap. 4); y Garcilasso (Com. Real., Parte I, lib. 8, Cap.\r\n24) distinguish three sorts of gold mines. In the first class are\r\ncounted those which produce pure gold in rather large grains, so that\r\nthey can be collected without further operations. These are, perhaps,\r\nthe sort that the secretary Sancho says are the richest, although he has\r\nnot spoken of them before. In the second class are included those which\r\nproduce gold in dust or in very small grains mixed with earth which it\r\nis necessary to remove by means of washing, and these are those which\r\nSancho mentions. The third class of mines, which this man does not\r\nmention, are those which yield gold mingled with stones and other\r\nmetals, just as silver is commonly found. These mines, although at times\r\nvery rich, failed to be worked because of the expenses which labour\r\ncaused.--Note by Icazbalceta.\r\n\r\n[122] Huayna Capac.\r\n\r\n[123] The text says _vino_--\"came.\" I think, however, that it must be a\r\nmisprint for _vivo_--\"lived.\"\r\n\r\n[124] This means, of course, Manco Inca.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY OF WORKS CONSULTED IN THE COURSE OF THIS TRANSLATION OF\r\nPEDRO SANCHO\r\n\r\n\r\n ACOSTA, JOSEPH DE:\r\n 1880.
