C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nSome years ago I was thinking of a little book, which now may or may\r\nnot ever get itself finished, about Shakespeare and the conditions,\r\nliterary and dramatic, under which Shakespeare wrote. My proper\r\ntask would have begun with the middle of the sixteenth century. But\r\nit seemed natural to put first some short account of the origins\r\nof play-acting in England and of its development during the Middle\r\nAges. Unfortunately it soon became apparent that the basis for such\r\na narrative was wanting. The history of the mediaeval theatre had\r\nnever, from an English point of view, been written. The initial\r\nchapter of Collier’s _Annals of the Stage_ is even less adequate than\r\nis usual with this slovenly and dishonest antiquary. It is with some\r\nsatisfaction that, in spite of the barrier set up by an incorrect\r\nreference, I have resolved one dramatic representation elaborately\r\ndescribed by Collier into a _soteltie_ or sweetmeat. More scholarly\r\nwriters, such as Dr. A. W. Ward, while dealing excellently with the\r\nmediaeval drama as literature, have shown themselves but little\r\ncurious about the social and economic facts upon which the mediaeval\r\ndrama rested. Yet from a study of such facts, I am sure, any literary\r\nhistory, which does not confine itself solely to the analysis of\r\ngenius, must make a start.\r\n\r\nAn attempt of my own to fill the gap has grown into these two\r\nvolumes, which have, I fear, been unduly swelled by the inclusion\r\nof new interests as, from time to time, they took hold upon me; an\r\ninterest, for example, in the light-hearted and coloured life of those\r\n_poverelli_ of letters, the minstrel folk; a very deep interest in\r\nthe track across the ages of certain customs and symbols of rural\r\ngaiety which bear with them the inheritance of a remote and ancestral\r\nheathenism. I can only hope that this disproportionate treatment of\r\nparts has not wholly destroyed the unity of purpose at which, after\r\nall, I aimed. If I may venture to define for myself the formula of\r\nmy work, I would say that it endeavours to state and explain the\r\npre-existing conditions which, by the latter half of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, made the great Shakespearean stage possible. The story is\r\none of a sudden dissolution and a slow upbuilding. I have arranged\r\nthe material in four Books. The First Book shows how the organization\r\nof the Graeco-Roman theatre broke down before the onslaught of\r\nChristianity and the indifference of barbarism, and how the actors\r\nbecame wandering minstrels, merging with the gleemen of their Teutonic\r\nconquerors, entertaining all classes of mediaeval society with\r\n_spectacula_ in which the dramatic element was of the slightest, and in\r\nthe end, after long endurance, coming to a practical compromise with\r\nthe hostility of the Church. In the Second Book I pass to _spectacula_\r\nof another type, which also had to struggle against ecclesiastical\r\ndisfavour, and which also made their ultimate peace with all but the\r\nmost austere forms of the dominant religion. These are the _ludi_\r\nof the village feasts, bearing witness, not only to their origin in\r\nheathen ritual, but also, by their constant tendency to break out into\r\nprimitive forms of drama, to the deep-rooted mimetic instinct of the\r\nfolk. The Third Book is a study of the process by which the Church\r\nitself, through the introduction of dramatic elements into its liturgy,\r\ncame to make its own appeal to this same mimetic instinct; and of that\r\nby which, from such beginnings, grew up the great popular religious\r\ndrama of the miracle-plays, with its offshoots in the moralities and\r\nthe dramatic pageants. The Fourth and final Book deals summarily\r\nwith the transformation of the mediaeval stage, on the literary side\r\nunder the influence of humanism, on the social and economic side by\r\nthe emergence from amongst the ruins of minstrelsy of a new class\r\nof professional players, in whose hands the theatre was destined to\r\nrecover a stable organization upon lines which had been departed from\r\nsince the days of Tertullian.\r\n\r\nI am very conscious of the manifold imperfections of these volumes.\r\nThey are the work, not of a professed student, but of one who only\r\nplays at scholarship in the rare intervals of a busy administrative\r\nlife. They owe much to the long-suffering officials of the British\r\nMuseum and the London Library, and more recently to the aid and\r\nencouragement of the Delegates of the Clarendon Press and their\r\naccomplished staff. The literary side of the mediaeval drama, about\r\nwhich much remains to be said, I have almost wholly neglected. I\r\nshall not, I hope, be accused of attaching too much importance in\r\nthe first volume to the vague and uncertain results of folk-lore\r\nresearch. One cannot be always giving expression to the minuter\r\nshades of probability. But in any investigation the validity of the\r\ninferences must be relative to the nature of the subject-matter;\r\nand, whether I qualify it in words or not, I do not, of course, make\r\na statement about the intention, say, of primitive sacrifice, with\r\nthe same confidence which attaches to one about matters of historic\r\nrecord. The burden of my notes and appendices sometimes appears to me\r\nintolerable. My excuse is that I wanted to collect, once for all, as\r\nmany facts with as precise references as possible. These may, perhaps,\r\nhave a value independent of any conclusions which I have founded upon\r\nthem. And even now I do not suppose that I have been either exhaustive\r\nor accurate. The remorseless ideal of the historian’s duties laid\r\ndown in the _Introduction aux Études Historiques_ of MM. Langlois\r\nand Seignobos floats before me like an accusing spirit. I know how\r\nvery far I am from having reached that austere standard of scientific\r\ncompleteness. To begin with, I had not the necessary training. Oxford,\r\nmy most kindly nurse, maintained in my day no _École des Chartes_,\r\nand I had to discover the rules of method as I went along. But the\r\ngreater difficulty has been the want of leisure and the spacious life.\r\nShades of Duke Humphrey’s library, how often, as I jostled for my turn\r\nat the crowded catalogue-shelves of the British Museum, have I not\r\nenvied those whose lot it is to tread your ample corridors and to bend\r\nover your yellowing folios! Amongst such happy scholars, the canons\r\nof Clio may claim implicit obedience. A silent company, they ‘class’\r\ntheir documents and ‘try’ their sources from morn to eve, disturbed\r\nin the pleasant ways of research only by the green flicker of leaves\r\nin the Exeter garden, or by the statutory inconvenience of a terminal\r\nlecture.--\r\n\r\n    ‘Tanagra! think not I forget!’\r\n\r\n    E.

Others, more limited in their scope, are named in the\r\npreliminary notes to the sections of the book on whose subject-matter\r\nthey bear.--An admirable general history of the modern drama is W.\r\nCreizenach’s still incomplete _Geschichte des neueren Dramas_ (Band i,\r\n_Mittelalter und Frührenaissance_, 1893; Bände ii, iii, _Renaissance\r\nund Reformation_, 1901-3). R. Prölss, _Geschichte des neueren Dramas_\r\n(1881-3), is slighter. The earlier work of J. L. Klein, _Geschichte des\r\nDramas_ (13 vols. 1865-76), is diffuse, inconvenient, and now partly\r\nobsolete. A valuable study is expected from J. M. Manly in vol. iii of\r\nhis _Specimens of the Pre-Shakespearean Drama_, of which two volumes,\r\ncontaining selected texts, appeared in 1897. C. Hastings, _Le Théâtre\r\nfrançais et anglais_ (1900, Eng. trans. 1901), is a compilation of\r\nlittle merit.--Prof. Creizenach may be supplemented for Germany by\r\nR. Froning, _Das Drama des Mittelalters_ (1891). For France there\r\nare the exhaustive and excellent volumes of L. Petit de Julleville’s\r\n_Histoire du Théâtre en France au Moyen Âge_ (_Les Mystères_, 1880;\r\n_Les Comédiens en France au Moyen Âge_, 1885; _La Comédie et les Mœurs\r\nen France au Moyen Âge_, 1886; _Répertoire du Théâtre comique au Moyen\r\nÂge_, 1886). G. Bapst, _Essai sur l’Histoire du Théâtre_ (1893),\r\nadds some useful material on the history of the stage. For Italy A.\r\nd’Ancona, _Origini del Teatro italiano_ (2nd ed., 1891), is also\r\nexcellent.--The best English book is A. W. Ward’s _History of English\r\nDramatic Literature to the death of Queen Anne_ (2nd ed., 1899). J.\r\nP. Collier, _History of English Dramatic Poetry_ (new ed., 1879), is\r\nfull of matter, but, for various reasons, not wholly trustworthy. J. J.\r\nJusserand, _Le Théâtre en Angleterre_ (2nd ed., 1881), J. A. Symonds,\r\n_Shakespeare’s Predecessors in the English Drama_ (1884), and G. M.\r\nGayley, _Representative English Comedies_ (1903), are of value. Texts\r\nwill be found in Manly’s and Gayley’s books, and in A. W. Pollard,\r\n_English Miracle Plays, Moralities and Interludes_ (3rd ed., 1898);\r\nW. C. Hazlitt, _Dodsley’s Old Plays_ (15 vols. 1874-6); A. Brandl,\r\n_Quellen des weltlichen Dramas in England_ (1898). F. H. Stoddard,\r\n_References for Students of Miracle Plays and Mysteries_ (1887),\r\nand K. L. Bates and L. B. Godfrey, _English Drama; a Working Basis_\r\n(1896), are rough attempts at bibliographies.--In addition the drama\r\nof course finds treatment in the general histories of literature. The\r\nbest are: for Germany, R. Kögel, _Geschichte der deutschen Literatur\r\nbis zum Ausgange des Mittelalters_ (1894-7, a fragment); K. Gödeke,\r\n_Grundriss zur Geschichte der deutschen Dichtung aus den Quellen_ (2nd\r\ned., 1884-1900); W. Scherer, _Geschichte der deutschen Litteratur_ (8th\r\ned., 1899): for France, L. Petit de Julleville (editor), _Histoire\r\nde la Langue et de la Littérature françaises_ (1896-1900); G. Paris,\r\n_La Littérature française au Moyen Âge_ (2nd ed., 1890): for Italy,\r\nA. Gaspary, _Geschichte der italienischen Litteratur_ (1884-9, Eng.\r\ntransl. 1901): for England, T. Warton, _History of English Poetry_ (ed.\r\nW. C. Hazlitt, 1871); B. Ten Brink, _History of English Literature_\r\n(Eng. trans. 1893-6); J. J. Jusserand, _Literary History of the English\r\nPeople_ (vol. i. 1895); W. J. Courthope, _History of English Poetry_\r\n(vols. i, ii. 1895-7); G. Saintsbury, _Short History of English\r\nLiterature_ (1898), and, especially for bibliography, G. Körting,\r\n_Grundriss der Geschichte der englischen Litteratur_ (3rd ed., 1899).\r\nThe _Periods of European Literature_, edited by Prof. Saintsbury,\r\nespecially G. Gregory Smith, _The Transition Period_ (1900), and\r\nthe two great _Grundrisse_, H. Paul, _Grundriss der germanischen\r\nPhilologie_ (2nd ed., 1896-1903), and G. Gröber, _Grundriss der\r\nromanischen Philologie_ (1888-1903), should also be consulted.--The\r\nbeginnings of the mediaeval drama are closely bound up with liturgy,\r\nand the nature of the liturgical books referred to is explained by W.\r\nMaskell, _A Dissertation upon the Ancient Service-Books of the Church\r\nof England_ (in _Monumenta Ritualia Ecclesiae Anglicanae_, 2nd ed.,\r\n1882, vol. iii); H. B. Swete, _Church Services and Service-Books before\r\nthe Reformation_ (1896); Procter-Frere, _New History of the Book of\r\nCommon Prayer_ (1901). The beginnings of Catholic ritual are studied by\r\nL. Duchesne, _Origines du Culte chrétien_ (3rd ed., 1902, Eng. trans.\r\n1903), and its mediaeval forms described by D. Rock, _The Church of our\r\nFathers_ (1849-53), and J. D. Chambers, _Divine Worship in England in\r\nthe Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries_ (1877).\r\n\r\nThe following list of books is mainly intended to elucidate the\r\nreferences in the footnotes, and has no claim to bibliographical\r\ncompleteness or accuracy. I have included the titles of a few German\r\nand French dissertations of which I have not been able to make use.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Aberdeen Records._ Extracts from the Council Register of the Burgh of\r\nAberdeen.

Körting, _Geschichte des\r\n    griechischen und römischen Theaters_ (1897). The details given\r\n    in L. Friedländer, _Sittengeschichte Roms in der Zeit von August\r\n    bis zum Ausgang der Antonine_ (vol. ii, 7th ed. 1901), and the\r\n    same writer’s article on _Die Spiele_ in vol. vi of Marquardt and\r\n    Mommsen’s _Handbuch der römischen Alterthümer_ (2nd ed. 1885),\r\n    may be supplemented from E. Nöldechen’s article _Tertullian und\r\n    das Theater_ in _Zeitschrift für Kirchengeschichte_, xv (1894),\r\n    161, for the _fabulae Atellanae_ from A. Dieterich, _Pulcinella_\r\n    (1897), chs. 4-8, and for the _pantomimi_ from C. Sittl, _Die\r\n    Gebärden der Griechen und Römer_ (1890), ch. 13. The account\r\n    in C. Magnin, _Les Origines du Théâtre moderne_ (vol. i, all\r\n    published, 1838), is by no means obsolete. Teuffel and Schwabe,\r\n    _History of Latin Literature_, vol. i, §§ 3-18 (trans. G. C. W.\r\n    Warr, 1891), contains a mass of imperfectly arranged material.\r\n    The later history of the Greek stage is dealt with by P. E.\r\n    Müller, _Commentatio historica de genio, moribus et luxu aevi\r\n    Theodosiani_ (1798), vol. ii, and A. E. Haigh, _Tragic Drama of\r\n    the Greeks_ (1896), ch. 6. The ecclesiastical prohibitions are\r\n    collected by W. Prynne, _Histriomastix_ (1633), and J. de Douhet,\r\n    _Dictionnaire des Mystères_ (1854), and their general attitude\r\n    summarized by H. Alt, _Theater und Kirche in ihrem gegenseitigen\r\n    Verhältniss_ (1846). S. Dill, _Roman Society in the Last Century\r\n    of the Roman Empire_ (2nd ed. 1899), should be consulted for an\r\n    admirable study of the conditions under which the pre-mediaeval\r\n    stage came to an end.]\r\n\r\n\r\nChristianity, emerging from Syria with a prejudice against\r\ndisguisings[1], found the Roman world full of _scenici_. The mimetic\r\ninstinct, which no race of mankind is wholly without, appears to have\r\nbeen unusually strong amongst the peoples of the Mediterranean stock.\r\nA literary drama came into being in Athens during the sixth century,\r\nand established itself in city after city. Theatres were built, and\r\ntragedies and comedies acted on the Attic model, wherever a Greek\r\nfoot trod, from Hipola in Spain to Tigranocerta in Armenia. The great\r\ncapitals of the later Greece, Alexandria, Antioch, Pergamum, rivalled\r\nAthens itself in their devotion to the stage. Another development of\r\ndrama, independent of Athens, in Sicily and Magna Graecia, may be\r\ndistinguished as farcical rather than comic. After receiving literary\r\ntreatment at the hands of Epicharmus and Sophron in the fifth century,\r\nit continued its existence under the name of mime (μῖμος), upon a\r\nmore popular level. Like many forms of popular drama, it seems to\r\nhave combined the elements of farce and morality. Its exponents are\r\ndescribed as buffoons (γελωτοποιοί, παιγνιογράφοι) and dealers in\r\nindecencies (ἀναισχυντογράφοι), and again as concerning themselves\r\nwith questions of character and manners (ἠθολόγοι, ἀρεταλόγοι). They\r\neven produced what sound singularly like problem plays (ὑποθέσεις).\r\nBoth qualities may have sprung from a common root in the observation\r\nand audacious portrayal of contemporary life. The mime was still\r\nflourishing in and about Tarentum in the third century[2].\r\n\r\nProbably the Romans were not of the Mediterranean stock, and their\r\nnative _ludi_ were athletic rather than mimetic. But the drama\r\ngradually filtered in from the neighbouring peoples. Its earliest\r\nstirrings in the rude farce of the _satura_ are attributed by Livy\r\nto Etruscan influence[3]. From Campania came another type of farce,\r\nthe _Oscum ludicrum_ or _fabula Atellana_, with its standing masks of\r\nMaccus and Bucco, Pappus and Dossennus, in whom it is hard not to find\r\na kinship to the traditional personages of the Neapolitan _commedia\r\ndell’ arte_. About 240 B. C. the Greek Livius Andronicus introduced\r\ntragedy and comedy. The play now became a regular element in the\r\n_spectacula_ of the Roman festivals, only subordinate in interest to\r\nthe chariot-race and the gladiatorial show. Permanent theatres were\r\nbuilt in the closing years of the Republic by Pompey and others, and\r\nthe number of days annually devoted to _ludi scenici_ was constantly\r\non the increase. From 48 under Augustus they grew to 101 under\r\nConstantius. Throughout the period of the Empire, indeed, the theatre\r\nwas of no small political importance. On the one hand it was the\r\nrallying point of all disturbers of the peace and the last stronghold\r\nof a public opinion debarred from the senate and the forum; on the\r\nother it was a potent means for winning the affection of the populace\r\nand diverting its attention from dynastic questions. The _scenici_\r\nmight be thorns in the side of the government, but they were quite\r\nindispensable to it. If their perversities drove them from Italy, the\r\nclamour of the mob soon brought them back again. Trajan revealed one\r\nof the _arcana imperii_ when he declared that the _annona_ and the\r\n_spectacula_ controlled Rome[4]. And what was true of Rome was true of\r\nByzantium, and in a lesser degree of the smaller provincial cities. So\r\nlong as the Empire itself held together, the provision firstly of corn\r\nand secondly of novel _ludi_ remained one of the chief preoccupations\r\nof many a highly placed official.\r\n\r\nThe vast popular audiences of the period under consideration cared but\r\nlittle for the literary drama. In the theatre of Pompey, thronged with\r\nslaves and foreigners of every tongue, the finer histrionic effects\r\nmust necessarily have been lost[5]. Something more spectacular and\r\nsensuous, something appealing to a cruder sense of humour, almost\r\ninevitably took their place. There is evidence indeed that, while the\r\ntheatres stood, tragedy and comedy never wholly disappeared from their\r\nboards[6]. But it was probably only the ancient masterpieces that got a\r\nhearing. Even in Greece performances of new plays on classical models\r\ncannot be traced beyond about the time of Hadrian. And in Rome the\r\ntragic poets had long before then learnt to content themselves with\r\nrecitations and to rely for victims on the good nature, frequently\r\ninadequate, of their friends[7]. The stilted dramas of Seneca were\r\nthe delight of the Renaissance, but it is improbable that, until the\r\nRenaissance, they were ever dignified with representation. Roughly\r\nspeaking, for comedy and tragedy the Empire substituted farce and\r\npantomime.\r\n\r\nFarce, as has been noticed, was the earliest traffic of the Roman\r\nstage. The Atellane, relegated during the brief vogue of comedy and\r\ntragedy to the position of an interlude or an afterpiece, now once\r\nmore asserted its independence. But already during the Republic the\r\nAtellane, with its somewhat conventional and limited methods, was\r\nbeginning to give way to a more flexible and vital type of farce.\r\nThis was none other than the old mime of Magna Graecia, which now\r\nentered on a fresh phase of existence and overran both West and East.\r\nThat it underwent considerable modifications, and probably absorbed\r\nmuch both of Atellane and of Attic comedy, may be taken for granted.\r\nCertainly it extended its scope to mythological themes. But its leading\r\ncharacteristics remained unchanged. The ethical element, one may\r\nfear, sank somewhat into the background, although it was by no means\r\nabsent from the work of the better mime-writers, such as Laberius and\r\nPublilius Syrus[8]. But that the note of shamelessness was preserved\r\nthere is no doubt whatever[9]. The favourite theme, which is common\r\nindeed to farce of all ages, was that of conjugal infidelity[10].\r\nUnchaste scenes were represented with an astonishing realism[11].\r\nContrary to the earlier custom of the classical stage, women took part\r\nin the performances, and at the _Floralia_, loosest of Roman festivals,\r\nthe spectators seem to have claimed it as their right that the _mimae_\r\nshould play naked[12]. The _mimus_--for the same term designates both\r\npiece and actor--was just the kind of entertainer whom a democratic\r\naudience loves. Clad in a parti-coloured _centunculus_, with no mask to\r\nconceal the play of facial gesture, and _planipes_, with no borrowed\r\ndignity of sock or buskin, he rattled through his side-splitting\r\nscenes of low life, and eked out his text with an inexhaustible\r\nvariety of rude dancing, buffoonery and horse-play[13]. Originally the\r\nmimes seem to have performed in monologues, and the action of their\r\npieces continued to be generally dominated by a single personage, the\r\n_archimimus_, who was provided with certain _stupidi_ and _parasiti_\r\nto act as foils and butts for his wit. A satirical intention was\r\nfrequently present in both mimes and Atellanes, and their outspoken\r\nallusions are more than once recorded to have wrung the withers of\r\npersons of importance and to have brought serious retribution on\r\nthe actors themselves. Caligula, for instance, with characteristic\r\nbrutality, had a ribald playwright burnt alive in the amphitheatre[14].\r\n\r\nThe farce was the diversion of the proletariat and the _bourgeoisie_\r\nof Rome. Petronius, with all the insolence of the literary man, makes\r\nTrimalchio buy a _troupe_ of comedians, and insist on their playing an\r\nAtellane[15]. The golden and cultured classes preferred the pantomimic\r\ndance. This arose out of the ruins of the literary drama. On the Roman\r\nstage grew up a custom, unknown in Greece, by which the lyric portions\r\nof the text (_cantica_) were entrusted to a singer who stood with\r\nthe flute-player at the side of the stage, while the actor confined\r\nhimself to dancing in silence with appropriate dumb show. The dialogue\r\n(_diverbia_) continued to be spoken by the actors. The next step was\r\nto drop the _diverbia_ altogether; and thus came the _pantomimus_ who\r\nundertook to indicate the whole development of a plot in a series\r\nof dramatic dances, during the course of which he often represented\r\nseveral distinct _rôles_. Instead of the single flute-player and\r\nsinger a full choir now supplied the musical accompaniment, and\r\ngreat poets--Lucan and Statius among the number--did not disdain to\r\nprovide texts for the _fabulae salticae_. Many of the _pantomimi_\r\nattained to an extreme refinement in their degenerate and sensuous\r\nart. They were, as Lucian said, χειρόσοφοι, erudite of gesture[16].\r\nTheir subjects were, for the most part, mythological and erotic, not\r\nto say lascivious, in character[17]. Pylades the Cilician, who, with\r\nhis great rival Bathyllus the Alexandrian, brought the dance to its\r\nfirst perfection under Augustus, favoured satyric themes; but this\r\nmode does not appear to have endured. Practically the dancers were the\r\ntragedians, and the mimes were the comedians, of the Empire. The old\r\nEtruscan name for an actor, _histrio_, came to be almost synonymous\r\nwith _pantomimus_[18]. Rome, which could lash itself into a fury over\r\nthe contests between the Whites and Reds or the Blues and Greens in the\r\ncircus, was not slow to take sides upon the respective merits of its\r\nscenic entertainers. The _histrionalis favor_ led again and again to\r\nbrawls which set the rulers of the city wondering whether after all the\r\n_pantomimi_ were worth while. Augustus had found it to his advantage\r\nthat the spirit of partisanship should attach itself to a Pylades or\r\na Bathyllus rather than to more illustrious antagonists[19]. But the\r\npersonal instincts of Tiberius were not so genial as those of Augustus.\r\nEarly in his principate he attempted to restrain the undignified court\r\npaid by senators and knights to popular dancers, and when this measure\r\nfailed, he expelled the _histriones_ from Italy[20]. The example\r\nwas followed by more than one of his successors, but Rome clamoured\r\nfiercely for its toys, and the period of exile was never a long one[21].\r\n\r\nBoth _mimi_ and _pantomimi_ had their vogue in private, at the\r\nbanquets and weddings of the great, as well as in public. The class\r\nof _scenici_ further included a heterogeneous variety of lesser\r\nperformers. There were the rhapsodes who sung the tragic _cantica_,\r\ntorn from their context, upon the stage. There were musicians and\r\ndancers of every order and from every land[22]. There were jugglers\r\n(_praestigiatores_, _acetabuli_), rope-walkers (_funambuli_),\r\nstilt-walkers (_grallatores_), tumblers (_cernui_, _petauristae_,\r\n_petaminarii_), buffoons (_sanniones_, _scurrae_), beast-tamers and\r\nstrong men. The pick of them did their ‘turns’ in the theatre or the\r\namphitheatre; the more humble were content with modest audiences\r\nat street corners or in the vestibule of the circus. From Rome the\r\nentertainers of the imperial race naturally found their way into the\r\ntheatres of the provinces. Tragedy and comedy no doubt held their own\r\nlonger in Greece, but the stage of Constantinople under Justinian does\r\nnot seem to have differed notably from the stage of Rome under Nero.\r\nMarseilles alone distinguished itself by the honourable austerity which\r\nforbade the _mimi_ its gates[23].\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that the profession of the _scenici_ ever\r\nbecame an honourable one in the eyes of the Roman law. They were for\r\nthe most part slaves or at best freedmen. They were deliberately\r\nbranded with _infamia_ or incapacity for civil rights. This _infamia_\r\nwas of two kinds, depending respectively upon the action of the censors\r\nas guardians of public dignity and that of the praetors as presidents\r\nin the law courts. The censors habitually excluded actors from the _ius\r\nsuffragii_ and the _ius honorum_, the rights of voting and of holding\r\nsenatorial or equestrian rank; the praetors refused to allow them, if\r\nmen, to appear as attorneys, if women, to appoint attorneys, in civil\r\nsuits[24]. The legislation of Julius Caesar and of Augustus added some\r\nstatutory disabilities. The _lex Iulia municipalis_ forbade actors to\r\nhold municipal _honores_[25]: the _lex Iulia de adulteriis_ set the\r\nexample of denying them the right to bring criminal actions[26]; the\r\n_lex Iulia et Papia Poppaea_ limited their privileges when freed, and\r\nin particular forbade senators or the sons of senators to take to wife\r\nwomen who had been, or whose parents had been, on the stage[27]. On the\r\nother hand Augustus confined the _ius virgarum_, which the praetors\r\nhad formerly had over _scenici_, to the actual place and time of\r\nperformances[28]; and so far as the censorian _infamia_ was concerned,\r\nthe whole tendency of the late Republic and early Empire was to relax\r\nits application to actors. It came to be possible for senators and\r\nknights to appear on the stage without losing caste. It was a grievous\r\ninsult when Julius Caesar compelled the mimograph Laberius to appear\r\nin one of his own pieces. But after all Caesar restored Laberius to\r\nhis rank of _eques_, a dignity which at a still earlier date Sulla had\r\nbestowed on Roscius[29]. Later the restriction broke down altogether,\r\nalthough not without an occasional reforming effort to restore it[30].\r\nNero himself was not ashamed to take the boards as a singer of\r\n_cantica_[31]. And even an _infamis_, if he were the boon companion\r\nof a prince, might be appointed to a post directly depending on the\r\nimperial dignity. Thus Caracalla sent a _pantomimus_ to hold a military\r\ncommand on the frontier, and Heliogabalus made another _praefectus\r\nurbi_ in Rome itself[32]. Under Constantine a reaction set in, and\r\na new decree formally excluded _scenici_ from all _dignitates_[33].\r\nThe severe class legislation received only reluctant and piecemeal\r\nmodification, and the praetorian _infamia_ outlived the Empire itself,\r\nand left its mark upon Carolingian jurisprudence[34].\r\n\r\nThe relaxation of the old Roman austerity implied in the popularity of\r\nthe _mimi_ and _histriones_ did not pass uncensured by even the pagan\r\nmoralists of the Empire. The stage has a share in the denunciations of\r\nTacitus and Juvenal, both of whom lament that princes and patricians\r\nshould condescend to practise arts once relegated to the _infames_.\r\nMartial’s hypocrite rails at the times and the theatres. Three\r\ncenturies later the soldierly Ammianus Marcellinus finds in the\r\ngyrations of the dancing-girls, three thousand of whom were allowed to\r\nremain in Rome when it was starving, a blot upon the fame of the state;\r\nand Macrobius contrasts the sober evenings of Praetextatus and his\r\nfriends with revels dependent for their mirth on the song and wanton\r\nmotions of the _psaltria_ or the jests of _sabulo_ and _planipes_[35].\r\nPolicy compelled the emperors to encourage _spectacula_, but even they\r\nwere not always blind to the ethical questions involved. Tiberius\r\nbased his expulsion of the _histriones_, at least in part, on moral\r\ngrounds. Marcus Aurelius, with a philosophic regret that the high\r\nlessons of comedy had sunk to mere mimic dexterity, sat publicly in\r\nhis box and averted his eyes to a state-paper or a book[36]. Julian,\r\nweaned by his tutor Mardonius from a boyish love of the stage, issued\r\nstrict injunctions to the priests of the Sun to avoid a theatre\r\nwhich he despaired of reforming[37]. Christian teachers, unconcerned\r\nwith the interests of a dynasty, and claiming to represent a higher\r\nmorality than that either of Marcus Aurelius or of Julian, naturally\r\ntook even stronger ground. Moreover, they had their special reasons\r\nfor hostility to the stage. That the actors should mock at the pagan\r\nreligion, with whose _ludi_ their own performances were intimately\r\nconnected, made a good dialectical point. But the connexion itself was\r\nunpardonable, and still more so the part taken by the mimes during\r\nthe war of creeds, in parodying and holding up to ridicule the most\r\nsacred symbols and mysteries of the church. This feeling is reflected\r\nin the legends of St. Genesius, St. Pelagia and other holy folk, who\r\nare represented as turning from the scenic profession to embrace\r\nChristianity, the conversion in some cases taking place on the very\r\nboards of the theatre itself[38]. So far as the direct attack upon\r\nthe stage is concerned, the key-note of patristic eloquence is struck\r\nin the characteristic and uncompromising treatise _De Spectaculis_\r\nof Tertullian. Here theatre, circus, and amphitheatre are joined in\r\na threefold condemnation. Tertullian holds that the Christian has\r\nexplicitly forsworn _spectacula_, when he renounced the devil and all\r\nhis works and vanities at baptism. What are these but idolatry, and\r\nwhere is idolatry, if not in the _spectacula_, which not only minister\r\nto lust, but take place at the festivals and in the holy places of\r\nVenus and Bacchus? The story is told of the demon who entered a woman\r\nin the theatre and excused himself at exorcism, because he had found\r\nher in his own demesne. A fervid exhortation follows. To worldly\r\npleasures Christians have no claim. If they need _spectacula_ they can\r\nfind them in the exercises of their Church. Here are nobler poetry,\r\nsweeter voices, maxims more sage, melodies more dulcet, than any comedy\r\ncan boast, and withal, here is truth instead of fiction. Moreover, for\r\nChristians is reserved the last great _spectaculum_ of all. ‘Then,’\r\nsays Tertullian, ‘will be the time to listen to the tragedians, whose\r\nlamentations will be more poignant for their proper pain. Then will\r\nthe comedians turn and twist, rendered nimbler than ever by the sting\r\nof the fire that is not quenched[39].’ With Tertullian asceticism\r\nis always a passion, but the vivid African rhetoric is no unfair\r\nsample of a _catena_ of outspoken comment which extends across the\r\nthird century from Tatian to Lactantius[40]. The judgement of the\r\nFathers finds more cautious expression in the disciplinary regulations\r\nof the Church. An early formal condemnation of actors is included\r\nin the so-called _Canons_ of Hippolytus[41], and the relations of\r\nconverts to the stage were discussed during the fourth century by\r\nthe councils of Elvira (306) and of Arles (314) and by the third and\r\nfourth councils of Carthage (397-398)[42]. It was hardly possible\r\nfor practical legislators to take the extreme step of forbidding\r\nChristian laymen to enter the theatre at all. No doubt that would be\r\nthe counsel of perfection, but in dealing with a deep-seated popular\r\ninstinct something of a compromise was necessary[43]. An absolute\r\nprohibition was only established for the clergy: so far as the laity\r\nwere concerned, it was limited to Sundays and ecclesiastical festivals,\r\nand on those days it was enforced by a threat of excommunication[44].\r\nNo Christian, however, might be a _scenicus_ or a _scenica_, or might\r\nmarry one; and if a member of the unhallowed profession sought to be\r\nbaptized, the preliminary of abandoning his calling was essential[45].\r\n\r\nIt is curious to notice that a certain sympathy with the stage seems\r\nto have been characteristic of one of the great heresiarchs. This was\r\nnone other than Arius, who is said to have had designs of setting up\r\na Christian theatre in rivalry to those of paganism, and his strange\r\nwork, the _Thaleia_, may perhaps have been intended to further the\r\nscheme. At any rate an orthodox controversialist takes occasion to\r\nbrand his Arian opponents and their works as ‘thymelic’ or ‘stagy’[46].\r\nBut it would probably be dangerous to lay undue stress upon what, after\r\nall, is as likely as not to be merely a dialectical metaphor.\r\n\r\nAfter the edict of Milan (313), and still more after the end of the\r\npagan reaction with the death of Julian (363), Christian influences\r\nbegan to make themselves felt in the civil legislation of the Empire.\r\nBut if the councils themselves were chary of utterly forbidding the\r\ntheatre, a stronger line was not likely to be taken in rescripts\r\nfrom Constantinople or Ravenna. The emperors were, indeed, in a\r\ndifficult position. They stood between bishops pleading for decency\r\nand humanity and populaces now traditionally entitled to their _panem\r\net spectacula_. The theatrical legislation preserved in the _Code_ of\r\nTheodosius is not without traces of this embarrassment[47]. It is\r\nrather an interesting study. The views of the Church were met upon two\r\npoints. One series of rescripts forbade performances on Sundays or\r\nduring the more sacred periods of the Christian calendar[48]: another\r\nrelaxed in favour of Christians the strict caste laws which sternly\r\nforbade actresses or their daughters to quit the unhappy profession in\r\nwhich they were born[49]. Moreover, certain sumptuary regulations were\r\npassed, which must have proved a severe restriction on the popularity\r\nas well as the liberty of actors. They were forbidden to wear gold\r\nor rich fabrics, or to ape the dress of nuns. They must avoid the\r\ncompany of Christian women and boys. They must not come into the public\r\nplaces or walk the streets attended by slaves with folding chairs[50].\r\nSome of the rescripts contain phrases pointed with the bitterest\r\ncontempt and detestation of their victims[51]. Theodosius will not\r\nhave the portraits of _scenici_ polluting the neighbourhood of his own\r\n_imagines_[52]. It is made very clear that the old court favourites\r\nare now to be merely tolerated. But they _are_ to be tolerated. The\r\nidea of suppressing them is never entertained. On the contrary the\r\nprovision of _spectacula_ and of performers for them remains one of\r\nthe preoccupations of the government[53]. The praetor is expected\r\nto be lavish on this item of his budget[54], and special municipal\r\nofficers, the _tribuni voluptatum_, are appointed to superintend the\r\narrangements[55]. Private individuals and rival cities must not deport\r\nactors, or withdraw them from the public service[56]. The bonds of\r\ncaste, except for the few freed by their faith, are drawn as tight as\r\never[57], and when pagan worship ceases the shrines are preserved from\r\ndemolition for the sake of the theatres built therein[58].\r\n\r\nThe love of even professing Christians for _spectacula_ proved hard to\r\ncombat. There are no documents which throw more light on the society of\r\nthe Eastern Empire at the close of the fourth century than the works\r\nof St. Chrysostom; and to St. Chrysostom, both as a priest at Antioch\r\nbefore 397 and as patriarch of Constantinople after that year, the\r\nstage is as present a danger as it was to Tertullian two centuries\r\nearlier[59]. A sermon preached on Easter-day, 399, is good evidence of\r\nthis. St. Chrysostom had been attacking the stage for a whole year, and\r\nhis exhortations had just come to nought. Early in Holy Week there was\r\na great storm, and the people joined the rogatory processions. But it\r\nwas a week of _ludi_. On Good Friday the circus, and on Holy Saturday\r\nthe theatre, were thronged and the churches were empty. The Easter\r\nsermon was an impassioned harangue, in which the preacher dwelt once\r\nmore on the inevitable corruption bound up with things theatrical,\r\nand ended with a threat to enforce the sentence of excommunication,\r\nprescribed only a few months before by the council of Carthage, upon\r\nwhoever should again venture to defy the Church’s law in like fashion\r\non Sunday or holy day[60]. Perhaps one may trace the controversy which\r\nSt. Chrysostom’s deliverance must have awakened, on the one hand in the\r\nrescript of the autumn of 399 pointedly laying down that the _ludicrae\r\nartes_ must be maintained, on the other in the prohibition of the\r\nfollowing year against performances in Holy week, and similar solemn\r\ntides.\r\n\r\nMore than a century after the exile and death of St. Chrysostom the\r\ntheatre was still receiving state recognition at Constantinople. A\r\nregulation of Justinian as to the _ludi_ to be given by newly elected\r\nconsuls specified a performance on the stage ominously designated\r\nas the ‘Harlots’[61]. By this date the _status_ of the theatrical\r\nprofession had at last undergone further and noticeable modification.\r\nThe ancient Roman prohibition against the marriage of men of noble\r\nbirth with _scenicae_ or other _infames_ or the daughters of such,\r\nhad been re-enacted under Constantine. A partial repeal in 454 had\r\nnot extended to the _scenicae_[62]. During the first half of the\r\nsixth century, however, a series of decrees removed their disability\r\non condition of their quitting the stage, and further made it an\r\noffence to compel slaves or freed women to perform against their\r\nwill[63]. In these humane relaxations of the rigid laws of theatrical\r\ncaste has often been traced the hand of the empress Theodora, who,\r\naccording to the contemporary gossip of Procopius, was herself, before\r\nher conversion, one of the most shameless of mimes. But it must be\r\nnoted that the most important of the decrees in question preceded the\r\naccession of Justinian, although it may possibly have been intended\r\nto facilitate his own marriage[64]. The history of the stage in the\r\nEast cannot be traced much further with any certainty. The canons of\r\nthe Quinisextine council, which met in the Trullan chamber to codify\r\necclesiastical discipline in 692, appear to contemplate the possibility\r\nof performances still being given[65]. A modern Greek scholar, M.\r\nSathas, has made an ingenious attempt to establish the existence of a\r\nByzantine theatrical tradition right through the Middle Ages; but Dr.\r\nKrumbacher, the most learned historian of Byzantine literature, is\r\nagainst him, and holds that, so far as our knowledge goes, the theatre\r\nmust be considered to have perished during the stress of the Saracen\r\ninvasions which, in the seventh and eighth centuries, devastated the\r\nEast[66].\r\n\r\nThe ending of the theatre in the West was in very similar fashion.\r\nChrysostom’s great Latin contemporaries, Augustine and Jerome, are at\r\none with him and with each other in their condemnation of the evils of\r\nthe public stage as they knew it[67]. Their divergent attitude on a\r\nminor point may perhaps be explained by a difference of temperament.\r\nThe fifth century saw a marked revival of literary interests from\r\nwhich even dignitaries of the Church did not hold themselves wholly\r\naloof. Ausonius urged his grandson to the study of Menander. Sidonius,\r\na bishop and no undevout one, read both Menander and Terence with\r\nhis son[68]. With this movement Augustine had some sympathy. In a\r\nwell-known passage of the _Confessions_ he records the powerful\r\ninfluence exercised by tragedy, and particularly erotic tragedy, over\r\nhis tempestuous youth[69]. And in the _City of God_ he draws a careful\r\ndistinction between the higher and the lower forms of drama, and if he\r\ndoes not approve, at least does not condemn, the use of tragedies and\r\ncomedies in a humane education[70]. Jerome, on the other hand, although\r\nhimself like Augustine a good scholar, takes a more ascetic line, and\r\na letter of his protesting against the reading of comedies by priests\r\nultimately came to be quoted as an authority in Roman canon law[71].\r\n\r\nThe references to the stage in the works of two somewhat younger\r\necclesiastical writers are of exceptional interest. Orosius was a\r\npupil of both Jerome and Augustine; and Orosius, endeavouring a few\r\nyears after the sack of Rome by the Goths to prove that that startling\r\ndisaster was not due to Christianity, lays great and indeed exaggerated\r\nimportance on the share of the theatre in promoting the decay of\r\nthe Empire[72]. About the middle of the fifth century the same note\r\nis struck by Salvian in his remarkable treatise _De Gubernatione\r\nDei_[73]. The sixth book of his work is almost entirely devoted to\r\nthe _spectacula_. Like Tertullian, Salvian insists on the definite\r\nrenunciation of _spectacula_ by Christians in their baptismal vow[74].\r\nLike Orosius, he traces to the weakening of moral fibre by these\r\naccursed amusements the failure of the West to resist the barbarians.\r\n_Moritur et ridet_ is his epigram on the Roman world. The citizens\r\nof Tréves, three times destroyed, still called upon their rulers for\r\nraces and a theatre. With the Vandals at the very gates of Cirta and of\r\nCarthage, _ecclesia Carthaginiensis insaniebat in circis, luxuriebat\r\nin theatris_[75]. Incidentally Salvian gives some valuable information\r\nas to the survival of the stage in his day. Already in 400 Augustine\r\nhad been able to say that the theatres were falling on every side[76].\r\nSalvian, fifty years later, confirms the testimony, but he adds the\r\nreason. It was not because Christians had learnt to be faithful\r\nto their vows and to the teachings of the Church; but because the\r\nbarbarians, who despised _spectacula_, and therein set a good example\r\nto degenerate Romans[77], had sacked half the cities, while in the rest\r\nthe impoverished citizens could no longer pay the bills. He adds that\r\nat Rome a circus was still open and a theatre at Ravenna, and that\r\nthese were thronged with delighted travellers from all parts of the\r\nEmpire[78]. There must, however, have been a theatre at Rome as well,\r\nfor Sidonius found it there when he visited the city, twelve years\r\nafter it had been sacked for the second time, in 467. He was appointed\r\nprefect of the city, and in one of his letters expresses a fear lest,\r\nif the corn-supply fail, the thunders of the theatre may burst upon\r\nhis head[79]. In a poem written a few years earlier he describes the\r\n_spectacula theatri_ of mimes, pantomimes, and acrobats as still\r\nflourishing at Narbonne[80].\r\n\r\nThe next and the latest records of the stage in the West date from the\r\nearlier part of the sixth century, when the Ostrogoths held sway in\r\nItaly. They are to be found in the _Variae_ of Cassiodorus, who held\r\nimportant official posts under the new lords of Rome, and they go to\r\nconfirm the inference which the complaint of Salvian already suggests\r\nthat a greater menace to the continuance of the theatre lay in the\r\ntaste of the barbarians than even in the ethics of Christianity.\r\n\r\nThe Ostrogoths had long dwelt within the frontiers of the Empire,\r\nand Theodoric, ruling as ‘King of the Goths and Romans in Italy,’\r\nover a mixed multitude of Italians and Italianate Germans, found it\r\nnecessary to continue the _spectacula_, which in his heart he despised.\r\nThere are many indications of this in the state-papers preserved in\r\nthe _Variae_, which may doubtless be taken to express the policy and\r\ntemper of the masters of Cassiodorus in the rhetorical trappings of the\r\nsecretary himself. The _scenici_ are rarely mentioned without a sneer,\r\nbut their performances and those of the _aurigae_, or circus-drivers,\r\nwho have now come to be included under the all-embracing designation\r\nof _histriones_, are carefully regulated[81]. The gladiators have,\r\nindeed, at last disappeared, two centuries after Constantine had had\r\nthe grace to suppress them in the East[82]. There is a letter from\r\nTheodoric to an architect, requiring him to repair the theatre of\r\nPompey, and digressing into an historical sketch, imperfectly erudite,\r\nof the history of the drama, its invention by the Greeks, and its\r\ndegradation by the Romans[83]. A number of documents deal with the\r\nchoice of a _pantomimus_ to represent the _prasini_ or ‘Greens,’ and\r\nshow that the rivalry of the theatre-factions remained as fierce as\r\nit had been in the days of Bathyllus and Pylades. Helladius is given\r\nthe preference over Thorodon, and a special proclamation exhorts the\r\npeople to keep the peace[84]. Still more interesting is the _formula_,\r\npreserved by Cassiodorus, which was used in the appointment of the\r\n_tribunus voluptatum_, an official whom we have already come across\r\nin the rescripts of the emperors of the fourth century. This is so\r\ncharacteristic, in its contemptuous references to the nature of the\r\nfunctions which it confers, of the whole German attitude in the\r\nmatter of _spectacula_, that it seems worth while to print it in an\r\nappendix[85]. The passages hitherto quoted from the _Variae_ all\r\nseem to belong to the period between 507 and 511, when Cassiodorus\r\nwas _quaestor_ and secretary to Theodoric at Rome. A single letter\r\nwritten about 533 in the reign of Athalaric shows that the populace was\r\nstill looking to its Gothic rulers for _spectacula_, and still being\r\ngratified[86]. Beyond this the Roman theatre has not been traced. The\r\nGoths passed in 553, and Italy was reabsorbed in the Empire. In 568\r\ncame the Lombards, raw Germans who had been but little under southern\r\ninfluence, and were far less ready than their predecessors to adopt\r\nRoman manners. Rome and Ravenna alone remained as outposts of the older\r\ncivilization, the latter under an exarch appointed from Constantinople,\r\nthe former under its bishop. At Ravenna the theatre may conceivably\r\nhave endured; at Rome, the Rome of Gregory the Great, it assuredly did\r\nnot. An alleged mention of a theatre at Barcelona in Spain during the\r\nseventh century resolves itself into either a survival of pagan ritual\r\nor a bull-fight[87]. Isidore of Seville has his learned chapters on\r\nthe stage, but they are written in the imperfect tense, as of what is\r\npast and gone[88]. The bishops and the barbarians had triumphed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                            MIMUS AND SCÔP\r\n\r\n    [_Bibliographical Note_ (for chs. ii-iv).--By far the best\r\n    account of minstrelsy is the section on _Les Propagateurs des\r\n    Chansons de Gestes_ in vol. ii of L. Gautier, _Les Épopées\r\n    françaises_ (2nd ed. 1892), bk. ii, chs. xvii-xxi. It may be\r\n    supplemented by the chapter devoted to the subject in J. Bédier,\r\n    _Les Fabliaux_ (2nd ed. 1895), and by the dissertation of E.\r\n    Freymond, _Jongleurs und Menestrals_ (Halle, 1883). I have not\r\n    seen A.

The English books are not good, and probably the most\r\n    reliable account of English minstrelsy is that in the following\r\n    pages; but materials may be found in J.

Gummere, _The Beginnings of Poetry_ (1901), should be\r\n    consulted on the relations of minstrelsy to communal poetry;\r\n    and other special points are dealt with by O. Hubatsch, _Die\r\n    lateinischen Vagantenlieder des Mittelalters_ (1870); G. Maugras,\r\n    _Les Comédiens hors la Loi_ (1887), and H. Lavoix, _La Musique\r\n    au Siècle de Saint-Louis_ (in G.

To the above list of authorities\r\n    should of course be added the histories of literature and of the\r\n    drama enumerated in the _General Bibliographical Note_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fall of the theatres by no means implied the complete extinction of\r\nthe _scenici_. They had outlived tragedy and comedy: they were destined\r\nto outlive the stage itself. Private performances, especially of\r\n_pantomimi_ and other dancers, had enjoyed great popularity under the\r\nEmpire, and had become an invariable adjunct of all banquets and other\r\nfestivities. At such revels, as at the decadence of the theatre and of\r\npublic morals generally, the graver pagans had looked askance[89]:\r\nthe Church naturally included them in its universal condemnation of\r\n_spectacula_. Chrysostom in the East[90], Jerome in the West[91],\r\nare hostile to them, and a canon of the fourth-century council of\r\nLaodicea, requiring the clergy who might be present at weddings and\r\nsimilar rejoicings to rise and leave the room before the actors were\r\nintroduced, was adopted by council after council and took its place as\r\npart of the ecclesiastical law[92]. The permanence of the regulation\r\nproves the strength of the habit, which indeed the Church might\r\nban, but was not able to subdue, and which seems to have commended\r\nitself, far more than the theatre, to Teutonic manners. Such irregular\r\nperformances proved a refuge for the dispossessed _scenici_. Driven\r\nfrom their theatres, they had still a vogue, not only at banquets,\r\nbut at popular merry-makings or wherever in street or country they\r\ncould gather together the remnant of their old audiences. Adversity\r\nand change of masters modified many of their characteristics. The\r\n_pantomimi_, in particular, fell upon evil times. Their subtle art had\r\nhad its origin in an exquisite if corrupt taste, and adapted itself\r\nwith difficulty to the ruder conditions of the new civilizations[93].\r\nThe _mimi_ had always appealed to a common and gross humanity. But even\r\nthey must now rub shoulders and contend for _denarii_ with jugglers and\r\nwith rope-dancers, with out-at-elbows gladiators and beast-tamers. More\r\nthan ever they learnt to turn their hand to anything that might amuse;\r\nlearnt to tumble, for instance; learnt to tell the long stories which\r\nthe Teutons loved. Nevertheless, in essentials they remained the same;\r\nstill jesters and buffoons, still irrepressible, still obscene. In\r\nlittle companies of two or three, they padded the hoof along the roads,\r\ntravelling from gathering to gathering, making their own welcome in\r\ncastle or tavern, or, if need were, sleeping in some grange or beneath\r\na wayside hedge in the white moonlight. They were, in fact, absorbed\r\ninto that vast body of nomad entertainers on whom so much of the gaiety\r\nof the Middle Ages depended. They became _ioculatores_, _jongleurs_,\r\nminstrels[94].\r\n\r\nThe features of the minstrels as we trace them obscurely from the sixth\r\nto the eleventh century, and then more clearly from the eleventh to\r\nthe sixteenth, are very largely the features of the Roman _mimi_ as\r\nthey go under, whelmed in the flood which bore away Latin civilization.\r\nBut to regard them as nothing else than _mimi_ would be a serious\r\nmistake. On another side they have a very different and a far more\r\nreputable ancestry. Like other factors in mediaeval society, they\r\nrepresent a merging of Latin and the Teutonic elements. They inherit\r\nthe tradition of the _mimus_: they inherit also the tradition of the\r\nGerman _scôp_[95]. The earliest Teutonic poetry, so far as can be\r\ngathered, knew no _scôp_. As will be shown in a later chapter, it was\r\ncommunal in character, closely bound up with the festal dance, or\r\nwith the rhythmic movements of labour. It was genuine folk-song, the\r\nutterance of no select caste of singers, but of whoever in the ring of\r\nworshippers or workers had the impulse and the gift to link the common\r\nmovements to articulate words. At the festivals such a spokesman would\r\nbe he who, for whatever reason, took the lead in the ceremonial rites,\r\nthe _vates_, germ at once of priest and bard. The subject-matter of\r\ncommunal song was naturally determined by the interests ruling on the\r\noccasions when it was made. That of daily life would turn largely on\r\nthe activities of labour itself: that of the high days on the emotions\r\nof religion, feasting, and love which were evoked by the primitive\r\nrevels of a pastoral or agricultural folk.\r\n\r\nPresently the movements of the populations of Europe brought the\r\nGermanic tribes, after separating from their Scandinavian kinsmen, into\r\ncontact with Kelts, with Huns, with the Roman Empire, and, in the\r\ninevitable recoil, with each other. Then for the first time war assumed\r\na prerogative place in their life. To war, the old habits and the old\r\npoetry adapted themselves. Tiwaz, once primarily the god of beneficent\r\nheaven, became the god of battles. The chant of prayer before the\r\nonset, the chant of triumph and thanksgiving after the victory, made\r\nthemselves heard[96]. From these were disengaged, as a distinct\r\nspecies of poetry, songs in praise of the deeds and deaths of great\r\ncaptains and popular heroes. Tacitus tells us that poetry served the\r\nGermans of his day for both chronology and history[97]. Jordanis, four\r\ncenturies later, has a similar account to give of the Ostrogoths[98].\r\nArminius, the vanquisher of a Roman army, became the subject of heroic\r\nsongs[99]: Athalaric has no higher word of praise for Gensimund\r\nthan _cantabilis_[100]. The glories of Alboin the Lombard[101], of\r\nCharlemagne himself[102], found celebration in verse, and Charlemagne\r\nwas at the pains to collect and record the still earlier _cantilenae_\r\nwhich were the chronicle of his race. Such historical _cantilenae_,\r\nmingled with more primitive ones of mythological import, form the basis\r\nof the great legendary epics[103]. But the process of epic-making is\r\none of self-conscious and deliberate art, and implies a considerable\r\nadvance from primitive modes of literary composition. No doubt the\r\nearliest heroic _cantilenae_ were still communal in character. They\r\nwere _rondes_ footed and sung at festivals by bands of young men and\r\nmaidens. Nor was such folk-song quick to disappear. Still in the\r\neleventh century the deeds of St. William of Orange resounded amongst\r\nthe _chori iuvenum_[104]; and spinning-room and village green were\r\ndestined to hear similar strains for many centuries more[105]. But\r\nlong before this the _cantilenae_ had entered upon another and more\r\nproductive course of development: they were in the mouths, not only of\r\nthe folk, but also of a body of professional singers, the fashioners of\r\nthe epic that was to be[106]. Like heroic song itself, the professional\r\nsingers owed their origin to war, and to the prominence of the\r\nindividual, the hero, which war entailed. Around the person of a great\r\nleader gathered his individual following or _comitatus_, bound to him\r\nby ties of mutual loyalty, by interchange of service and reward[107].\r\nAmongst the _comitatus_ room was found for one who was no spearman,\r\nbut who, none the less honoured for that, became the poet of the group\r\nand took over from the less gifted _chorus_ the duty of celebrating\r\nthe praises of the chieftain. These he sung to the accompaniment, no\r\nlonger of flying feet, but of the harp, struck when the meal was over\r\nin tent or hall. Such a harper is the characteristically Germanic type\r\nof professional entertainer. He has his affinities with the Demodokos\r\nof a Homeric king. Rich in dignities and guerdons, sitting at the foot\r\nof the leader, consorting on equal terms with the warriors, he differs\r\nwholly from the _scenicus infamis_, who was the plaything and the scorn\r\nof Rome. Precisely when the shifting of social conditions brought him\r\ninto being it is hard to say. Tacitus does not mention him, which is\r\nno proof, but a presumption, that amongst the tribes on the frontier\r\nhe had not yet made his appearance in the first century of the Empire.\r\nBy the fifth century he was thoroughly established, and the earliest\r\nrecords point to his existence at least as early as the fourth. These\r\nare not to be found in Latin sources, but in those early English\r\npoems which, although probably written in their extant forms after\r\nthe invasion of these islands, seem to date back in substance to the\r\nage when the Angles still dwelt in a continental home around the base\r\nof the Jutish peninsula. The English remained to a comparatively late\r\nstage of their history remote from Roman influence, and it is in their\r\nliterature that both the original development of the Teutonic _scôp_\r\nand his subsequent contamination by the Roman _mimus_ can most easily\r\nbe studied.\r\n\r\nThe earliest of all English poems is almost certainly _Widsith_, the\r\n‘far-traveller.’ This has been edited and interpolated in Christian\r\nEngland, but the kernel of it is heathen and continental[108]. It is\r\nan autobiographic sketch of the life of Widsith, who was himself an\r\nactual or ideal _scôp_, or rather _gleómon_, for the precise term\r\n_scôp_ is not used in the poem. Widsith was of the Myrgings, a small\r\nfolk who dwelt hard by the Angles. In his youth he went with Ealhhild,\r\nthe ‘weaver of peace,’ on a mission to Eormanric the Ostrogoth.\r\nEormanric is the Hermanric of legend, and his death in 375 A. D. gives\r\nan approximate date to the events narrated. Then Widsith became a\r\nwanderer upon the face of the earth, one who could ‘sing and say a\r\nstory’ in the ‘mead-hall.’ He describes the nations and rulers he has\r\nknown. Eormanric gave him a collar of beaten gold, and Guthhere the\r\nBurgundian a ring. He has been with Caesar, lord of jocund cities, and\r\nhas seen Franks and Lombards, Finns and Huns, Picts and Scots, Hebrews,\r\nIndians, Egyptians, Medes and Persians. At the last he has returned\r\nto the land of the Myrgings, and with his fellow Scilling has sung\r\nloud to the harp the praises of his lord Eadgils and of Ealhhild the\r\ndaughter of Eadwine. Eadgils has given him land, the inheritance of his\r\nfathers. The poem concludes with an eulogy of the life of gleemen. They\r\nwander through realm upon realm, voice their needs, and have but to\r\ngive thanks. In every land they find a lord to whom songs are dear, and\r\nwhose bounty is open to the exalters of his name. Of less undeniable\r\nantiquity than _Widsith_ are the lines known as the _Complaint of\r\nDeor_. These touch the seamy side of the singer’s life. Deor has\r\nbeen the _scôp_ of the Heodenings many winters through. But one more\r\nskilled, Heorrenda by name--the Horant of the Gudrun saga--has outdone\r\nhim in song, and has been granted the land-right that once was Deor’s.\r\nHe finds his consolation in the woes of the heroes of old. ‘They have\r\nendured: may not I endure[109]?’ The outline drawn in _Widsith_ and in\r\n_Deor_ is completed by various passages in the epic of _Beowulf_, which\r\nmay be taken as representing the social conditions of the sixth or\r\nearly seventh century. In Heorot, the hall of Hrothgar, there was sound\r\nof harp, the gleewood. Sweetly sang the _scôp_ after the mead-bench.\r\nThe lay was sung, the gleeman’s _gyd_ told. Hrothgar’s thanes, even\r\nHrothgar himself, took their turns to unfold the wondrous tale. On the\r\nother hand, when a folk is in sorrow, no harp is heard, the glee-beam\r\nis silent in the halls[110]. In these three poems, then, is fully\r\nlimned the singer of Teutonic heathenism. He is a man of repute, the\r\nequal of thanes. He holds land, even the land of his fathers. He\r\nreceives gifts of gold from princes for the praise he does them. As\r\nyet no distinction appears between _scôp_ and _gleómon_. Widsith is at\r\none time the resident singer of a court; at another, as the mood takes\r\nhim, a wanderer to the ends of the earth. And though the _scôp_ leads\r\nthe song, the warriors and the king himself do not disdain to take\r\npart in it. This is noteworthy, because it gives the real measure of\r\nthe difference between the Teutonic and the Roman entertainer. For a\r\nNero to perform amongst the _scenici_ was to descend: for a Hrothgar to\r\ntouch the harp was a customary and an honourable act.\r\n\r\nThe singing did not cease when the English came to these islands. The\r\nlong struggle with the Britons which succeeded the invasions assuredly\r\ngave rise to many new lays, both in Northumbria and Wessex. ‘England,’\r\nsays Mr. Stopford Brooke, ‘was conquered to the music of verse, and\r\nsettled to the sound of the harp.’ But though Alfred and Dunstan knew\r\nsuch songs, they are nearly all lost, or only dimly discerned as the\r\nbasis of chronicles. At the end of the sixth century, just as the\r\nconquest was completed, came Christianity. The natural development of\r\nEnglish poetry was to some extent deflected. A religious literature\r\ngrew up at the hands of priests. Eadhelm, who, anticipating a notion\r\nof St. Francis of Assisi, used to stand on a bridge as if he were a\r\ngleeman, and waylay the folk as they hurried back from mass, himself\r\nwrote pious songs. One of these, a _carmen triviale_, was still sung in\r\nthe twelfth century[111]. This was in Wessex. In Northumbria, always\r\nthe most literary district of early England, the lay brother Cædmon\r\nfounded a school of divine poetry. But even amongst the disciples\r\nof Cædmon, some, such as the author of the very martial _Judith_,\r\nseem to have designed their work for the mead-hall as well as the\r\nmonastery[112]. And the regular _scôp_ by no means vanished. The\r\n_Wanderer_, a semi-heathen elegiac poem of the early eighth century,\r\nseems to be the lament of a _scôp_ driven from his haunts, not by\r\nChristianity, but by the tumults of the day[113]. The great poet of\r\nthe next generation, Cynewulf, himself took treasure of appled gold\r\nin the mead-hall. A riddle on ‘the wandering singer’ is ascribed to\r\nhim[114], and various poems of his school on the fates or the crafts of\r\nman bear witness to the continued existence of the class[115]. With the\r\neighth century, except for the songs of war quoted or paraphrased in\r\nthe _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_, the extant Early English poetry reaches a\r\nsomewhat inexplicable end. But history comes to the rescue, and enables\r\nus still to trace the _scôp_. It is in the guise of a harp-player that\r\nAlfred is reported to have fooled the Danes, and Anlaf in his turn to\r\nhave fooled the Saxons[116]: and mythical as these stories may be, they\r\nwould not have even been plausible, had not the presence of such folk\r\nby the camp-fire been a natural and common event.\r\n\r\nCertainly the _scôp_ survived heathenism, and many Christian bishops\r\nand pious laymen, such as Alfred[117], were not ashamed of their\r\nsympathy with secular song. Nevertheless, the entertainers of the\r\nEnglish folk did not find favour in the eyes of the Church as a\r\nwhole. The stricter ecclesiastics especially attacked the practice\r\nof harbouring them in religious houses. Decrees condemning this were\r\nmade by the council on English affairs which sat at Rome in 679[118],\r\nand by the council of Clovesho in 747[119]. Bede, writing at about\r\nthe latter date on the condition of church affairs in Northumbria\r\ncomplains of those who make mirth in the dwellings of bishops[120];\r\nand the complaint is curiously illustrated by a letter of Gutbercht,\r\nabbot of Newcastle, to an episcopal friend on the continent, in which\r\nhe asks him for a _citharista_ competent to play upon the _cithara_\r\nor _rotta_ which he already possesses[121]. At the end of the eighth\r\ncentury, Alcuin wrote a letter to Higbald, bishop of Lindisfarne,\r\nwarning him against the snares of _citharistae_ and _histriones_[122]:\r\nand some two hundred years later, when Edgar and Dunstan[123] were\r\nsetting themselves to reform the religious communities of the land, the\r\nfavour shown to such ribald folk was one of the abuses which called\r\nfor correction[124]. This hostile attitude of the rulers of the Church\r\nis not quite explained by anything in the poetry of the _scôpas_, so\r\nfar as it is left to us. This had very readily exchanged its pagan\r\nfor a Christian colouring: it cannot be fairly accused of immorality\r\nor even coarseness, and the Christian sentiment of the time is not\r\nlikely to have been much offended by the prevailing theme of battle and\r\ndeeds of blood. The probable explanation is a double one. There is the\r\nascetic tendency to regard even harmless forms of secular amusement\r\nas barely compatible with the religious life. And there is the fact,\r\nwhich the language of the prohibitions themselves makes plain, that a\r\ndegeneration of the old Teutonic gleemen had set in. To singing and\r\nharping were now added novel and far less desirable arts. Certainly the\r\nprohibitions make no exception for _poetae_ and _musici_; but the full\r\nstrength of their condemnation seems to be directed against _scurrae_\r\nand their _ioca_, and against the _mimi_ and _histriones_ who danced as\r\nwell as sang. These are new figures in English life, and they point to\r\nthe fact that the merging of the Teutonic with the Latin entertainer\r\nhad begun. To some extent, the Church itself was responsible for\r\nthis. The conversion of England opened the remote islands to Latin\r\ncivilization in general: and it is not to be wondered at, that the\r\n_mimi_, no less than the priests, flocked into the new fields of\r\nenterprise. If this was the case already in the eighth century, we can\r\nhardly doubt that it was still more so during the next two hundred\r\nyears of which the literary records are so scanty. Such a view is\r\nsupported by the numerous miniatures of dancers and tumblers, jugglers\r\nand bear-leaders, in both Latin and Early English manuscripts of this\r\nperiod[125], and by the glosses which translate such terms as _mimus_,\r\n_iocista_, _scurra_, _pantomimus_ by _gligmon_, reserving _scôp_ for\r\nthe dignified _poeta_[126]. This distinction I regard as quite a late\r\none, consequent upon the degeneracy introduced by _mimi_ from south\r\nEurope into the lower ranks of the gleemen. Some writers, indeed, think\r\nthat it existed from the beginning, and that the _scôp_ was always the\r\nresident court poet, whereas the _gleómon_ was the wandering singer,\r\noften a borrower rather than a maker of songs, who appealed to the\r\nsmaller folk[127]. But the theory is inconsistent with the data of\r\n_Widsith_. The poet there described is sometimes a wanderer, sometimes\r\nstationary. He is evidently at the height of his profession, and has\r\nsung before every crowned head in Europe, but he calls himself a\r\n_gleómon_. Nor does the etymology of the words _scôp_ and _gleómon_\r\nsuggest any vital difference of signification[128].\r\n\r\nThe literary records of the continental Teutons are far scantier\r\nthan those of the English. But amongst them also Latin and barbaric\r\ntraditions seem to have merged in the _ioculator_. Ancestral deeds\r\nwere sung to the harp, and therefore, it may be supposed, by a _scôp_,\r\nand not a _chorus_, before the Ostrogoths in Italy, at the beginning\r\nof the sixth century[129]. In the year 507 Clovis the Frank sent to\r\nTheodoric for a _citharoedus_ trained in the musical science of the\r\nSouth, and Boethius was commissioned to make the selection[130]. On the\r\nother hand, little as the barbarians loved the theatre, the _mimi_ and\r\n_scurrae_ of the conquered lands seem to have tickled their fancy as\r\nthey sat over their wine. At the banquet with which Attila entertained\r\nthe imperial ambassadors in 448, the guests were first moved to\r\nmartial ardour and to tears by the recital of ancient deeds of prowess,\r\nand then stirred to laughter by the antics of a Scythian and a Moorish\r\nbuffoon[131]. Attila was a Hun and no German; but the Vandals who\r\ninvaded Africa in 429 are recorded to have taken to the _spectacula_\r\nso extravagantly popular there[132], and Sidonius tells how _mimici\r\nsales_, chastened in view of barbaric conceptions of decency, found a\r\nplace in the festivities of another Theodoric, king from 462 to 466 of\r\nthe Visigoths in Gaul[133]. Three centuries later, under Charlemagne,\r\nthe blending of both types of entertainer under the common designation\r\nof _ioculator_ seems to be complete. And, as in contemporary England,\r\nthe animosity of the Church to the _scenici_ is transferred wholesale\r\nto the _ioculatores_, without much formal attempt to discriminate\r\nbetween the different grades of the profession. Alcuin may perhaps be\r\ntaken as representing the position of the more rigid disciplinarians\r\non this point. His letter to the English bishop, Higbald, does not\r\nstand alone. In several others he warns his pupils against the\r\ndangers lurking in _ludi_ and _spectacula_[134], and he shows himself\r\nparticularly exercised by the favour which they found with Angilbert,\r\nthe literary and far from strict-lived abbot of St. Richer[135]. The\r\ninfluence of Alcuin with Charlemagne was considerable, and so far as\r\necclesiastical rule went, he had his way. A capitulary (†787) excluded\r\nthe Italian clergy from uncanonical sports[136]. In 789 bishops,\r\nabbots, and abbesses were forbidden to keep _ioculatores_[137], and in\r\n802 a decree applying to all in orders required abstinence from idle\r\nand secular amusements[138]. These prohibitions were confirmed in the\r\nlast year of Charlemagne’s reign (813) by the council of Tours[139].\r\nBut as entertainers of the lay folk, the minstrels rather gained than\r\nlost status at the hands of Charlemagne. Personally he took a distinct\r\ninterest in their performances. He treasured up the heroic _cantilenae_\r\nof his race[140], and attempted in vain to inspire the _saevitia_ of\r\nhis sons with his own enthusiasm for these[141]. The chroniclers more\r\nthan once relate how his policy was shaped or modified by the chance\r\nwords of a _ioculator_ or _scurra_[142]. The later tradition of the\r\n_jougleurs_ looked back to him as the great patron of their order, who\r\nhad given them all the fair land of Provence in fee[143]: and it is\r\nclear that the songs written at his court form the basis not only of\r\nthe _chansons de gestes_, but also, as we found to be the case with the\r\nEnglish war-songs, of many passages in the chronicles themselves[144].\r\nAfter Charlemagne’s death the minstrels fell for a time on evil days.\r\nLouis the Pious by no means shared his father’s love for them. He\r\nattempted to suppress the _cantilenae_ on which he had been brought up,\r\nand when the _mimi_ jested at court would turn away his head and refuse\r\nto smile[145]. To his reign may perhaps be ascribed a decree contained\r\nin the somewhat dubious collection of Benedictus Levita, forbidding\r\nidle dances, songs and tales in public places and at crossways on\r\nSundays[146], and another which continued for the benefit of the\r\nminstrels the legal incapacity of the Roman _scenici_, and excluded\r\n_histriones_ and _scurrae_ from all privilege of pleading in courts of\r\njustice[147].\r\n\r\nThe ill-will of a Louis the Pious could hardly affect the hold which\r\nthe minstrels had established on society. For good or for bad, they\r\nwere part of the mediaeval order of things. But their popularity had\r\nto maintain itself against an undying ecclesiastical prejudice. They\r\nhad succeeded irrevocably to the heritage of hate handed down from\r\nthe _scenici infames_. To be present at their performances was a sin\r\nin a clerk, and merely tolerated in a layman. Largesse to them was\r\ndeclared tantamount to robbery of the poor[148]. It may be fairly said\r\nthat until the eleventh century at least the history of minstrelsy\r\nis written in the attacks of ecclesiastical legislators, and in the\r\nexultant notices of monkish chroniclers when this or that monarch\r\nwas austere enough to follow the example of Louis the Pious, and\r\nlet the men of sin go empty away[149]. Throughout the Middle Ages\r\nproper the same standpoint was officially maintained[150]. The canon\r\nlaw, as codified by Gratian, treats as applicable to minstrels the\r\npronouncements of fathers and councils against the _scenici_, and adds\r\nto them others more recent, in which clergy who attend _spectacula_, or\r\nin any way by word or deed play the _ioculator_, are uncompromisingly\r\ncondemned[151]. This temper of the Church did not fail to find its\r\nexpression in post-Conquest England. The council of Oxford in 1222\r\nadopted for this country the restatement of the traditional rule by the\r\nLateran council of 1215[152]; and the stricter disciplinary authorities\r\nat least attempted to enforce the decision. Bishop Grosseteste\r\nof Lincoln, for instance, pressed it upon his clergy in or about\r\n1238[153]. The reforming provisions of Oxford in 1259 laid down that,\r\nalthough minstrels might receive charitable doles in monasteries, their\r\n_spectacula_ must not be given[154]; and a similar prohibition, couched\r\nin very uncomplimentary terms, finds a place in the new statutes drawn\r\nup in 1319 for the cathedral church of Sarum by Roger de Mortival[155].\r\nA few years later the statutes of St. Albans follow suit[156], while\r\nin 1312 a charge of breaking the canons in this respect brought\r\nagainst the minor clergy of Ripon minster had formed the subject\r\nof an inquiry by Archbishop Greenfield[157]. Such notices might be\r\nmultiplied[158]; and the tenor of them is echoed in the treatises of\r\nthe more strait-laced amongst monkish writers. John of Salisbury[159],\r\nWilliam Fitz Stephen[160], Robert Mannyng of Brunne[161], are at one in\r\ntheir disapproval of _ioculatores_. As the fourteenth century draws to\r\nits close, and the Wyclifite spirit gets abroad, the freer critics of\r\nchurch and state, such as William Langland[162] or the imagined author\r\nof Chaucer’s _Parson’s Tale_[163], take up the same argument. And they\r\nin their turn hand it on to the interminable pamphleteering of the\r\nCalvinistic Puritans[164].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                           THE MINSTREL LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe perpetual _infamia_ of the minstrels is variously reflected in the\r\nliterature of their production. Sometimes they take their condemnation\r\nlightly enough, dismissing it with a jest or a touch of bravado. In\r\n_Aucassin et Nicolete_, that marvellous romance of the _viel caitif_,\r\nwhen the hero is warned that if he takes a mistress he must go to hell,\r\nhe replies that, to hell will he go, for thither go all the goodly\r\nthings of the world. ‘Thither go the gold and the silver, and the vair\r\nand the grey, and thither too go harpers and minstrels and the kings\r\nof the world. With these will I go, so that I have Nicolete, my most\r\nsweet friend, with me’[165]. At other times they show a wistful sense\r\nof the pathos of their secular lot. They tell little stories in which\r\nheaven proves more merciful than the vice-gerents of heaven upon earth,\r\nand Virgin or saint bestows upon a minstrel the sign of grace which the\r\npriest denies[166]. But often, again, they turn upon their persecutors\r\nand rend them with the merciless satire of the _fabliaux_, wherein it\r\nis the clerk, the theologian, who is eternally called upon to play the\r\nindecent or ridiculous part[167].\r\n\r\nUnder spiritual disabilities the minstrels may have been, but so far as\r\nsubstantial popularity amongst all classes went, they had no cause from\r\nthe eleventh to the fourteenth century to envy the monks. As a social\r\nand literary force they figure largely both on the continent and in\r\nEngland. The distinctively Anglo-Saxon types of _scôp_ and _gleómon_ of\r\ncourse disappear at the Conquest. They do not cease to exist; but they\r\ngo under ground, singing their defiant lays of Hereward[168]; and they\r\npursue a more or less subterranean career until the fourteenth century\r\nbrings the English tongue to its own again. But minstrelsy was no less\r\npopular with the invaders than with the invaded. Whether the _skald_\r\nhad yet developed amongst the Scandinavian pirates who landed with\r\nRollo on the coasts of France may perhaps be left undetermined[169]:\r\nfor a century and a half had sufficed to turn the Northmen into Norman\r\nFrench, and with the other elements of the borrowed civilization had\r\ncertainly come the _ioculator_. In the very van of William’s army\r\nat Senlac strutted the minstrel Taillefer, and went to his death\r\nexercising the double arts of his hybrid profession, juggling with\r\nhis sword, and chanting an heroic lay of Roncesvalles[170]. Twenty\r\nyears later, Domesday Book records how Berdic the _ioculator regis_\r\nheld three vills and five carucates of land in Gloucestershire, and\r\nhow in Hampshire Adelinda, a _ioculatrix_, held a virgate, which\r\nEarl Roger had given her[171]. During the reigns of the Angevin and\r\nPlantagenet kings the minstrels were ubiquitous. They wandered at their\r\nwill from castle to castle, and in time from borough to borough, sure\r\nof their ready welcome alike in the village tavern, the guildhall,\r\nand the baron’s keep[172]. They sang and jested in the market-places,\r\nstopping cunningly at a critical moment in the performance, to gather\r\ntheir harvest of small coin from the bystanders[173]. In the great\r\ncastles, while lords and ladies supped or sat around the fire, it was\r\ntheirs to while away many a long bookless evening with courtly _geste_\r\nor witty sally. At wedding or betrothal, baptism or knight-dubbing,\r\ntreaty or tournament, their presence was indispensable. The greater\r\nfestivities saw them literally in their hundreds[174], and rich was\r\ntheir reward in money and in jewels, in costly garments[175], and in\r\nbroad acres. They were licensed vagabonds, with free right of entry\r\ninto the presence-chambers of the land[176]. You might know them from\r\nafar by their coats of many colours, gaudier than any knight might\r\nrespectably wear[177], by the instruments upon their backs and those\r\nof their servants, and by the shaven faces, close-clipped hair and\r\nflat shoes proper to their profession[178]. This kenspeckle appearance,\r\ntogether with the privilege of easy access, made the minstrel’s dress\r\na favourite disguise in ages when disguise was often imperative. The\r\ndevice attributed by the chroniclers to Alfred and to Anlaf becomes in\r\nthe romances one of the commonest of _clichés_[179]. The readiness with\r\nwhich the minstrels won the popular ear made them a power in the land.\r\nWilliam de Longchamp, the little-loved chancellor of Richard I, found\r\nit worth his while to bring a number of them over from France, that\r\nthey might sing his praises abroad in the public places[180]. Nor were\r\nthey less in request for satire than for eulogy. The English speaking\r\nminstrels, in particular, were responsible for many songs in derision\r\nof unpopular causes and personalities[181]; and we need not doubt\r\nthat ‘the lay that Sir Dinadan made by King Mark, which was the worst\r\nlay that ever harper sang with harp or with any other instruments,’\r\nmust have had its precise counterparts in actual life[182]. The Sarum\r\nstatutes of 1319 lay especial stress on the flattery and the evil\r\nspeaking with which the minstrels rewarded their entertainers[183].\r\nSometimes, indeed, they over-reached themselves, for Henry I is related\r\nto have put out the eyes of Lucas de Barre, a Norman _jougleur_, or\r\nperhaps rather _trouvère_, who made and sang songs against him[184].\r\nBut Lucas de Barre’s rank probably aggravated his offence, and as a\r\nrule the minstrels went scot-free. A wiser churchman here and there\r\nwas not slow to perceive how the unexampled hold of minstrelsy on\r\nthe popular ear might be turned to the service of religion. Eadhelm,\r\nstanding in gleeman’s attire on an English bridge to mingle words of\r\nserious wisdom with his _carmina trivialia_, is one instance[185]. And\r\nin the same spirit St. Francis, himself half a troubadour in youth,\r\nwould call his Minorites _ioculatores Domini_, and send them singing\r\nover the world to beg for their fee the repentance and spiritual joy\r\nof their hearers[186]. A popular hymn-writer of the present day is\r\nalleged to have thought it ‘hard that the devil should have all the\r\ngood tunes’; but already in the Middle Ages religious words were being\r\nset to secular music, and graced with the secular imagery of youth and\r\nspring[187].\r\n\r\nBut if the minstrels were on the one hand a force among the people,\r\non the other they had the ear of kings. The English court to judge\r\nby the payments recorded in the exchequer books, must have been full\r\nof them[188]. The fullest and most curious document on the subject\r\ndates from the reign of Edward I. It is a roll of payments made on the\r\noccasion of a Whitsuntide feast held in London in the year 1306, and a\r\nvery large number of the minstrels recorded are mentioned by name[189].\r\nAt the head of the list come five minstrels with the high-sounding\r\ntitle of _le roy_[190], and these get five marks apiece. A number of\r\nothers follow, who received sums varying from one mark upwards. Most\r\nof these have French names, and many are said to be in the company of\r\nthis or that noble or reverend guest at the feast. Finally, two hundred\r\nmarks were distributed in smaller sums amongst the inferior minstrels,\r\n_les autres menestraus de la commune_, and some of these seem to have\r\nbeen of English birth. Below the _roys_ rank two minstrels, Adam le\r\nBoscu and another, who are dignified with the title of _maistre_, which\r\nprobably signifies that they were clerks[191]. The other names are\r\nmainly descriptive, ‘Janin le Lutour,’ ‘Gillotin le Sautreour,’ ‘Baudec\r\nle Taboureur,’ and the like; a few are jesting stage names, such as\r\nthe inferior performers of our music halls bear to-day[192]. Such are\r\n‘Guillaume sanz Maniere,’ ‘Reginaldus le Menteur,’ ‘le Petit Gauteron,’\r\n‘Parvus Willielmus,’ and those of the attractive comedians Perle in the\r\nEghe, and Matill’ Makejoye. The last, by the way, is the only woman\r\nperformer named. The resources of Edward I could no doubt stand the\r\nstrain of rewarding with royal magnificence the entertainers of his\r\nguests. There is plenty of evidence, however, that even on secular\r\ngrounds the diatribes of the moralists against the minstrels were often\r\nenough justified. To the lavish and unthrifty of purse they became\r\nblood-suckers. Matilda, the wife of Henry I, is said to have squandered\r\nmost of her revenues upon them[193]; while the unfortunate Robert\r\nof Normandy, if no less a chronicler than Ordericus Vitalis may be\r\nbelieved, was stripped by these rapacious gentry to the very skin[194].\r\nYet for all the days of honour and all the rich gifts the minstrel life\r\nmust have had its darker side. Easily won, easily parted with; and the\r\nlands and laced mantles did not last long, when the elbow itched for\r\nthe dice-box. This was the incurable ruin of the minstrel folk[195].\r\nAnd even that life of the road, so alluring to the fever in the blood,\r\nmust have been a hard one in the rigours of an English climate. To\r\ntramp long miles in wind and rain, to stand wet to the skin and hungry\r\nand footsore, making the slow _bourgeois_ laugh while the heart was\r\nbitter within; such must have been the daily fate of many amongst the\r\nhumbler minstrels at least[196]. And at the end to die like a dog in\r\na ditch, under the ban of the Church and with the prospect of eternal\r\ndamnation before the soul.\r\n\r\nKings and nobles were not accustomed to depend for their entertainment\r\nmerely upon the stray visits of wandering minstrels. Others more or\r\nless domiciled formed a permanent part of the household. These indeed\r\nare the minstrels in the stricter sense of that term--_ministri_,\r\n_ministeriales_. In Domesday Book, as we have seen, one Berdic bears\r\nthe title of the _ioculator regis_. Shortly afterwards Henry I had his\r\n_mimus regis_, by name Raherus, who made large sums by his _suavitas\r\niocularis_, and founded the great priory of St. Bartholomew at\r\nSmithfield[197]. Laying aside his parti-coloured coat, he even became\r\nhimself the first prior of the new community. The old spirit remained\r\nwith him, however; and it is recorded that the fame of the house was\r\nlargely magnified by means of some feigned miracles which Raherus put\r\nforth. Richard I was a noted lover of song, and the names of more than\r\none minstrel of his are preserved. There was Ambroise, who was present\r\nat Richard’s coronation in 1189 and at the siege of Acre in 1191, and\r\nwho wrote a history, still extant, of the third crusade[198]. And there\r\nwas that Blondiaux or Blondel de Nesle, the story of whose discovery\r\nof his captive master, apocryphal though it may be, is in all the\r\nhistory books[199]. Henry III had his _magister Henricus versificator_\r\nin 1251[200], and his _magister Ricardus citharista_ in 1252[201]. A\r\nharper was also amongst the _ministri_ of Prince Edward in the Holy\r\nWar[202], and when the prince became Edward I, he still retained one in\r\nhis service. He is mentioned as Walter de Stourton, the king’s harper,\r\nin 1290[203], and as the _citharista regis_ in 1300[204]. Edward II had\r\nseveral minstrels, to one of whom, William de Morlee, known as _Roy de\r\nNorth_, he made a grant of land[205]. By this time the royal minstrels\r\nseem to have become a regular establishment of no inconsiderable\r\nnumbers. Under Edward III they received 7¹⁄₂_d._ a day[206]. A little\r\nlater in the reign, between 1344 and 1347, there were nineteen who\r\nreceived 12_d._ a day in war, when they doubtless formed a military\r\nband, and 20_s._ a year in peace. These included five trumpeters, one\r\ncitoler, five pipers, one tabouretter, two clarions, one nakerer,\r\nand one fiddler, together with three additional minstrels, known as\r\nwaits[207]. The leader of the minstrels bore the title of _rex_, for in\r\n1387 we find a licence given by Richard II to his _rex ministrallorum_,\r\nJohn Caumz, permitting him to pass the seas[208]. Henry V had fifteen\r\nminstrels when he invaded France in 1415, and at a later date eighteen,\r\nwho received 12_d._ a day apiece[209]. At the end of his reign his\r\nminstrels received 100_s._ a year, and this annuity was continued under\r\nHenry VI, who in 1455 had twelve of them, besides a wait. In the next\r\nyear this king issued a commission for the impressing of boys to fill\r\nvacancies in the body[210]. Edward IV had thirteen minstrels and a\r\nwait[211]. By 1469 these had been cut down to eight. At their head was\r\na chief, who was now called, not as in Richard II’s time _rex_, but\r\n_marescallus_[212]. The eight king’s minstrels and their _marescallus_\r\ncan be traced through the reign of Henry VII, and so on into the\r\nsixteenth century[213].\r\n\r\nNor was the royal household singular in the maintenance of a permanent\r\nbody of minstrels. The _citharista_ of Margaret, queen of Edward I,\r\nis mentioned in 1300, and her _istrio_ in 1302[214]. Philippa, queen\r\nof Edward III, had her minstrels in 1337[215], and those of Queen\r\nElizabeth were a regular establishment in the reign of Henry VII[216].\r\nThe Scottish court, too, had its recognized troupe, known by the early\r\nyears of the sixteenth century as the ‘minstrels of the chekkar[217].’\r\nAs with kings and queens so with lesser men. The list of minstrels\r\nat court in 1306 includes the harpers and other musicians of several\r\nlords, both English and foreign[218]. In 1308 the earl of Lancaster had\r\na body of _menestralli_ and an _armiger menestrallorum_[219]. During\r\nthe fourteenth and fifteenth centuries entries of payments to the\r\nminstrels of a vast number of _domini_, small and great, are common in\r\nthe account books[220]. Henry, earl of Derby, took minstrels with him\r\nin his expeditions abroad of 1390 and 1392[221]; while the _Household\r\nBook_ of the earl of Northumberland (†1512) shows that he was\r\naccustomed to entertain ‘a Taberett, a Luyte, and a Rebecc,’ as well as\r\nsix ‘trompettes[222].’ Minstrels are also found, from the beginning of\r\nthe fifteenth century, in the service of the municipal corporations.\r\nLondon, Coventry, Bristol, Shrewsbury, Norwich, Chester, York,\r\nBeverley, Leicester, Lynn, Canterbury had them, to name no others.\r\nThey received fixed fees or dues, wore the town livery and badge of a\r\nsilver scutcheon, played at all local celebrations and festivities, and\r\nwere commonly known as _waits_[223]. This term we have already found\r\nin use at court, and the ‘Black Book,’ which contains the household\r\nregulations of Edward IV, informs us that the primary duty of a wait\r\nwas to ‘pipe the watch,’ summer and winter, at certain fixed hours of\r\nthe night[224].\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that established minstrels, whether royal,\r\nnoble, or municipal, were always in constant attendance on their lords.\r\nCertain fixed services were required of them, which were not very\r\nserious, except in the case of waits[225]; for the rest of their time\r\nthey were free. This same ‘Black Book’ of Edward IV is very explicit on\r\nthe point. The minstrels are to receive a yearly fee and a livery[226].\r\nThey must attend at court for the five great feasts of the year. At\r\nother times, two or three out of their number, or more if the king\r\ndesire it, are to be in waiting. The last regulation on the subject\r\nis curious. The king forbids his minstrels to be too presumptuous or\r\nfamiliar in asking rewards of any lord of the land; and in support of\r\nthis he quotes a similar prohibition by the Emperor Henry II[227].\r\nDoubtless, in the intervals of their services, the household minstrels\r\ntravelled, like their unattached brethren of the road, but with the\r\nadded advantage of a letter of recommendation from their lord, which\r\nensured them the hospitality of his friends[228]. Such letters were\r\nindeed often given, both to the minstrels of a man’s own household and\r\nas testimonials to other minstrels who may have especially pleased the\r\ngiver. Those interesting collections of mediaeval epistolary formulae,\r\nthe _summae dictaminis_, contain many models for them, and judging by\r\nthe lavish eulogy which they employ, the minstrels themselves must have\r\nhad a hand in drawing them up[229]. Many minstrels probably confined\r\nthemselves to short tours in the vicinity of their head quarters;\r\nothers, like Widsith, the Anglo-Saxon _scôp_, were far travellers. John\r\nCaumz received a licence from Richard II to cross the seas, and in 1483\r\nwe find Richard III entertaining minstrels of the dukes of Austria\r\nand Bavaria[230]. Possibly the object of John Caumz was to visit one\r\nof the _scolae ministrallorum_ in France, where experiences might be\r\nexchanged and new songs learnt. Beauvais, Lyon, Cambrai were famous for\r\nthese schools, which were held year by year in Lent, when performances\r\nwere stopped; and the wardrobe accounts of Edward III record grants of\r\nlicences and expenses to Barbor and Morlan, two bagpipers, to visit the\r\n_scolas ministrallis in partibus trans mare_[231].\r\n\r\nFrom the fourteenth century it is possible to trace the growth of the\r\nhousehold minstrels as a privileged class at the expense of their less\r\nfortunate rivals. The freedom of access enjoyed by the entertainers of\r\nearlier days was obviously open to abuse. We have seen that in 1317\r\nit led to the offering of an insult to Edward II by an emissary clad\r\nas a minstrel at his own table. It was only two years before that a\r\nroyal proclamation had considerably restrained the liberty of the\r\nminstrels. In view of the number of idle persons who ‘under colour of\r\nmynstrelsie’ claimed food, drink, and gifts in private houses, it was\r\nordered ‘that to the houses of prelates earls and barons none resort\r\nto meate and drynke, unless he be a mynstrel, and of these mynstrels\r\nthat there come none except it be three or four minstrels of honour\r\nat the most in one day, unlesse he be desired of the lorde of the\r\nhouse.’ The houses of meaner men are to be altogether exempt, except\r\nat their desire[232]. I think it is probable that by ‘minstrels of\r\nhonour’ we must here understand ‘household minstrels[233]’; and that\r\nthe severity of the ordinance must have come upon those irresponsible\r\nvagrants who had not the shelter of a great man’s name. With the\r\nStatutes of Labourers in the middle of the fourteenth century begins a\r\nhistory of legislation against ‘vacabonds and valiant beggars,’ which\r\nput further and serious difficulties in the way of the free movement\r\nof the migratory classes through the country[234]. Minstrels, indeed,\r\nare not specifically declared to be ‘vacabonds’ until this legislation\r\nwas codified by William Cecil in 1572[235]; but there is evidence that\r\nthey were none the less liable to be treated as such, unless they\r\nhad some protection in the shape of livery or licence. At Chester\r\nfrom the early thirteenth century, and at Tutbury in Staffordshire\r\nfrom 1380, there existed courts of minstrelsy which claimed to issue\r\nlicences to all performers within their purview. It is not probable\r\nthat this jurisdiction was very effective. But a step taken by Edward\r\nIV in 1469 had for its avowed object to strengthen the hands of what\r\nmay be called official minstrelsy. Representation had been made to the\r\nking that certain rude husbandmen and artificers had usurped the title\r\nand livery of his minstrels, and had thus been enabled to gather an\r\nillegitimate harvest of fees. He therefore created or revived a regular\r\nguild or fraternity of minstrels, putting his own household performers\r\nwith their _marescallus_ at the head of it, and giving its officers\r\na disciplinary authority over the profession throughout the country,\r\nwith the exception of Chester. It is not improbable, although it is\r\nnot distinctly stated, that admission into the guild was practically\r\nconfined to ‘minstrels of honour.’ Certainly one of the later local\r\nguilds which grew up in the sixteenth century, that of Beverley,\r\nlimited its membership to such as could claim to be ‘mynstrell to some\r\nman of honour or worship or waite of some towne corporate or other\r\nancient town, or else of such honestye and conyng as shalbe thought\r\nlaudable and pleasant to the hearers[236].’ In any case the whole drift\r\nof social development was to make things difficult for the independent\r\nminstrels and to restrict the area of their wanderings.\r\n\r\nThe widespread popularity of the minstrels amongst the mediaeval laity,\r\nwhether courtiers, burghers, or peasants, needs no further labouring.\r\nIt is more curious to find that in spite of the formal anathemas of the\r\nChurch upon their art, they were not, as a matter of fact, rigorously\r\nheld at arm’s length by the clergy. We find them taking a prominent\r\npart in the holyday festivities of religious guilds[237]; we find\r\nthem solacing the slow progress of the pilgrimages with their ready\r\nwit and copious narrative or song[238]; we find them received with\r\nfavour by bishops, even upon their visitations[239], and not excluded\r\nfrom a welcome in the hall of many a monastery. As early as 1180, one\r\nGalfridus, a _citharoedus_, held a ‘corrody,’ or right to a daily\r\ncommons of food and drink in the abbey of Hyde at Winchester[240].\r\nAnd payments for performances are frequent in the accounts of the\r\nAugustinian priories at Canterbury[241], Bicester, and Maxtoke, and\r\nthe great Benedictine houses of Durham, Norwich, Thetford, and St.\r\nSwithin’s, Winchester[242], and doubtless in those of many another\r\ncloistered retreat. The Minorite chroniclers relate, how at the time\r\nof the coming of the friars in 1224 two of them were mistaken for\r\nminstrels by the porter of a Benedictine grange near Abingdon, received\r\nby the prior and brethren with unbecoming glee, and when the error was\r\ndiscovered, turned out with contumely[243]. At such semi-religious\r\nfoundations also, as the college of St. Mary at Winchester, or\r\nWaynflete’s great house of St. Mary Magdalen in Oxford, minstrels of\r\nall degrees found, at least by the fifteenth century, ready and liberal\r\nentertainment[244].\r\n\r\nHow, then, is one to reconcile this discrepancy between the actual\r\npractice of the monasteries and the strict, the uncompromising\r\nprohibition of minstrelsy in rule and canon? An incomplete answer\r\nreadily presents itself. The monks being merely human, fell short of\r\nthe ideal prescribed for them. We do not now learn for the first time,\r\nthat the ambitions of the pious founder, the ecclesiastical law-giver,\r\nthe patristic preacher, were one thing; the effective daily life of\r\nchurchmen in many respects quite another. Here, as in matters of even\r\nmore moment, did mediaeval monasticism ‘dream from deed dissever’--\r\n\r\n    ‘The reule of Seint Maure or of Seint Beneit,\r\n    By-cause that it was old and som-del streit\r\n    This ilke monk leet olde thinges pace,\r\n    And held after the newe world the space.’\r\n\r\nTrue enough, but not the whole truth. It doubtless explains the\r\nbehaviour of the Benedictines of Abingdon; but we can hardly suppose\r\nthat when Robert de Grosseteste, the sworn enemy of ecclesiastical\r\nabuses, kept his harper’s chamber next his own, he was surreptitiously\r\nallowing himself an illegitimate gratification which he denied to his\r\nclergy. The fact is that the condemnations of the Church, transferred,\r\nas we have seen, wholesale from the _mimi_ and _histriones_ of the\r\ndecaying Empire, were honestly not applicable without qualification,\r\neven from the ecclesiastical point of view, to their successors, the\r\n_mimi_ and _histriones_ of the Middle Ages. The traditions of the Roman\r\nstage, its manners, its topics, its ethical code, became indeed a large\r\npart of the direct inheritance of minstrelsy. But, as we have seen,\r\nthey were far from being the whole of that inheritance. The Teutonic\r\nas well as the Latin element in the civilization of western Europe\r\nmust be taken into account. The minstrel derives from the disreputable\r\n_planipes_; he derives also from the _scôp_, and has not altogether\r\nrenounced the very different social and ethical position which the\r\n_scôp_ enjoyed. After all, nine-tenths of the secular music and\r\nliterature, something even of the religious literature, of the Middle\r\nAges had its origin in minstrelsy. Practically, if not theoretically,\r\nthe Church had to look facts in the face, and to draw a distinction\r\nbetween the different elements and tendencies that bore a single name.\r\nThe formularies, of course, continued to confound all minstrels under\r\nthe common condemnation of _ioculatores_. The Church has never been\r\ngood at altering its formularies to suit altered conditions. But it\r\nhas generally been good at practical compromises. And in the case of\r\nminstrelsy, a practical compromise, rough enough, was easily arrived at.\r\n\r\nThe effective conscience of the thirteenth-century Church had clearly\r\ncome to recognize degrees in the ethical status of the minstrels.\r\nNo more authoritative exponent of the official morals of his day\r\ncan be desired than St. Thomas Aquinas, and St. Thomas Aquinas is\r\nvery far from pronouncing an unqualified condemnation of all secular\r\nentertainment. The profession of an _histrio_, he declares, is by no\r\nmeans in itself unlawful. It was ordained for the reasonable solace\r\nof humanity, and the _histrio_ who exercises it at a fitting time\r\nand in a fitting manner is not on that account to be regarded as a\r\nsinner[245]. Another contemporary document is still more explicit.\r\nThis is the _Penitential_ written at the close of the thirteenth\r\ncentury by Thomas de Cabham, sub-dean of Salisbury and subsequently\r\narchbishop of Canterbury[246]. In the course of his analysis of human\r\nfrailty, Thomas de Cabham makes a careful classification from the\r\nethical point of view, of minstrels. There are those who wear horrible\r\nmasks, or entertain by indecent dance and gesture. There are those\r\nagain who follow the courts of the great, and amuse by satire and by\r\nraillery. Both these classes are altogether damnable. Those that remain\r\nare distinguished by their use of musical instruments. Some sing wanton\r\nsongs at banquets. These too are damnable, no less than the satirists\r\nand posture-mongers. Others, however, sing of the deeds of princes, and\r\nthe lives of the saints. To these it is that the name _ioculatores_\r\nmore strictly belongs, and they, on no less an authority than that of\r\nPope Alexander himself[247], may be tolerated.\r\n\r\nOf the three main groups of minstrels distinguished by Thomas de\r\nCabham, two correspond roughly to the two broad types which, from the\r\npoint of view of racial tradition, we have already differentiated. His\r\nmusicians correspond to the Teutonic gleemen and their successors;\r\nhis posture-mongers and buffoons to the Roman _mimi_ and their\r\nsuccessors. Who then are Thomas de Cabham’s third and intermediate\r\ngroup, the satirists whose lampoons beset the courts of the great?\r\nWell, raillery and invective, as we have seen, were common features\r\nof minstrelsy; but Gautier may very likely be right when he surmises\r\nthat Thomas de Cabham has particularly in mind the _scolares vagantes_,\r\nwho brought so much scandal upon the Church during the twelfth and\r\nthirteenth centuries[248]. Some of these were actually out at elbows\r\nand disfrocked clerks; others were scholars drifting from university\r\nto university, and making their living meantime by their wits; most\r\nof them were probably at least in minor orders. But practically they\r\nlived the life of the minstrels, tramping the road with them, sharing\r\nthe same temptations of wine, women, and dice, and bringing into the\r\nprofession a trained facility of composition, and at least a flavour\r\nof classical learning[249]. They were indeed the main intermediaries\r\nbetween the learned and the vernacular letters of their day; the spilth\r\nof their wit and wisdom is to be found in the burlesque Latin verse of\r\nsuch collections as the _Carmina Burana_, riotous lines, by no means\r\ndevoid of poetry, with their half-humorous half-pathetic burden,\r\n\r\n    ‘In taberna quando sumus\r\n    Non curamus quid sit humus[250].’\r\n\r\nAnd especially they were satirists, satirists mainly of the hypocrisy,\r\ncupidity and evil living of those in the high places of the Church,\r\nfor whom they conceived a grotesque expression in Bishop Golias, a\r\ntype of materialistic prelate, in whose name they wrote and whose\r\n_pueri_ or _discipuli_ they declared themselves to be[251]. _Goliardi_,\r\n_goliardenses_, their reputation in the eyes of the ecclesiastical\r\nauthorities was of the worst, and their ill practices are coupled with\r\nthose of the minstrels in many a condemnatory decree[252].\r\n\r\nIt is not with the _goliardi_ then, that Thomas de Cabham’s relaxation\r\nof the strict ecclesiastical rigours is concerned. Neither is it,\r\nnaturally enough, with the lower minstrels of the _mimus_ tradition.\r\nTowards these Thomas de Cabham, like his predecessors, is inexorable.\r\nAnd even of the higher minstrels the musicians and singers, his\r\ntoleration has its limits. He discriminates. In a sense, a social\r\nand professional sense, all these higher minstrels fall into the\r\nsame class. But from the ethical point of view there is a very\r\nmarked distinction amongst them. Some there are who haunt taverns\r\nand merry-makings with loose songs of love and dalliance. These it\r\nis not to be expected that the holy mother Church should in any way\r\ncountenance. Her toleration must be reserved for those more reputable\r\nperformers who find material for their verse either in the life\r\nand conversation of the saints and martyrs themselves, or at least\r\nin the noble and inspiring deeds of national heroes and champions.\r\nLegends of the saints and gests of princes: if the minstrels will\r\nconfine themselves to the celebration of these, then, secure in\r\nthe pronouncement of a pope, they may claim a hearing even from\r\nthe devout. It would be rash to assert that even the comparatively\r\nliberal theory of Thomas de Cabham certainly justified in all cases\r\nthe practice of the monasteries. But it is at least noteworthy that\r\nin several instances where the subjects of the minstrelsy presented\r\nfor the delectation of a cowled audience remain upon record, they do\r\nfall precisely within the twofold definition which he lays down. At\r\nWinchester in 1338 the minstrel Herbert sang the song of Colbrond (or\r\nGuy of Warwick), and the gest of the miraculous deliverance of Queen\r\nEmma; while at Bicester in 1432 it was the legend of the Seven Sleepers\r\nof Ephesus that made the Epiphany entertainment of the assembled canons.\r\n\r\nIf now we set aside the very special class of ribald _galiardi_, and\r\nif we set aside also the distinction drawn by Thomas de Cabham on\r\npurely ethical grounds between the minstrels of the love-songs and the\r\nminstrels of saintly or heroic gest, the net result is the twofold\r\nclassification of higher and lower minstrels already familiar to us.\r\nRoughly--it must always be borne in mind how roughly--it corresponds\r\non the one hand to the difference between the Teutonic and the Roman\r\ntradition, on the other to the distinction between the established\r\n‘minstrel of honour’ and his unattached rival of the road. And there\r\nis abundant evidence that such a distinction was generally present,\r\nand occasionally became acute, in the consciousness of the minstrels\r\nthemselves. The aristocrats of minstrelsy, a Baudouin or a Jean de\r\nCondé, or a Watriquet de Couvin, have very exalted ideas as to the\r\ndignity of their profession. They will not let you, if they can help\r\nit, put the _grans menestreus_ on the same level with every-day\r\n_jangleur_ of poor attainments and still poorer repute[253]. In\r\nthe _Dit des Taboureurs_ again it is a whole class, the _joueurs de\r\nvielle_, who arise to vindicate their dignity and to pour scorn upon\r\nthe humble and uninstructed drummers[254]. But the most instructive and\r\ncurious evidence comes from Provence. It was in 1273, when the amazing\r\ngrowth of Provençal poetry was approaching its sudden decay, that the\r\nlast of the great troubadours, Guiraut de Riquier, addressed a verse\r\n_Supplicatio_ to Alphonso X of Castile on the state of minstrelsy.\r\nHe points out the confusion caused by the indiscriminate grouping\r\nof poets, singers, and entertainers of all degrees under the title\r\nof _joglars_, and begs the king, as high patron of letters, to take\r\norder for it. A reply from Alphonso, also in verse, and also, one\r\nmay suspect, due to the fertile pen of Guiraut Riquier, is extant.\r\nHerein he establishes or confirms a fourfold hierarchy. At the head\r\ncome two classes, the _doctors de trobar_ and the _trobaires_, who are\r\ncomposers, the former of didactic, the latter of ordinary songs and\r\nmelodies. Beneath these are the _joglars_ proper, instrumentalists\r\nand reciters of delightful stories, and beneath these again the\r\n_bufos_, the entertainers of common folk, who have really no claim\r\nto be considered as _joglars_ at all[255]. One of the distinctions\r\nhere made is new to us. The difference between _doctor de trobar_ and\r\n_trobaire_ is perhaps negligible. But that between the _trobaire_ or\r\ncomposer and the _joglar_ or executant of poetry, is an important one.\r\nIt is not, however, so far as the Teutonic element in minstrelsy goes,\r\nprimitive. The _scôpas_ and the French or Anglo-Norman _ioculatores_\r\nup to the twelfth century composed their verses as a class, and sang\r\nthem as well[256]. In Provence, however, the Teutonic element in\r\nminstrelsy must have been of the slightest, and perhaps the Roman\r\ntradition, illustrated by the story of Laberius, of a marked barrier\r\nbetween composing and executing, had vaguely lingered. At any rate it\r\nis in Provence, in the eleventh century, that the distinction between\r\n_trobaire_ and _joglar_ makes its appearance. It never became a very\r\ncomplete one. The _trobaire_ was generally, not always, of gentle or\r\nburgess birth; sometimes actually a king or noble. In the latter case\r\nhe contented himself with writing his songs, and let the _joglars_\r\nspread them abroad. But the bulk of the _trobaires_ lived by their art.\r\nThey wandered from castle to castle, alone with a _vielle_, or with\r\n_joglars_ in their train, and although they mingled with their hosts\r\non fairly equal terms, they did not disdain to take their rewards of\r\nhorse or mantle or jewel, just like any common performer. Moreover,\r\nthey confined themselves to lyric poetry, leaving the writing of epic,\r\nso far as epic was abroad in Provence, to the _joglars_[257]. From\r\nProvence, the _trobaire_ spread to other countries, reappearing in\r\nthe north of France and England as the _trouvère_. We seem to trace\r\nan early _trouvère_ in Lucas de Barre in the time of Henry I. But\r\nit is Eleanor of Poitiers, daughter of the _trobaire_ count William\r\nof Poitiers, and mother of the _trouvère_ Richard Cœur de Lion,\r\nwho appears as the chief intermediary between north and south. The\r\nintrusion of the _trouvère_ was the first step in the degradation of\r\nminstrelsy. Amongst the Anglo-Saxons, even apart from the _cantilenae_\r\nof the folk, the professional singer had no monopoly of song. Hrothgar\r\nand Alfred harped with their _scôpas_. But if there had been a similar\r\ntendency amongst the continental Teutons who merged in the French\r\nand Norman-French, it had been checked by the complete absorption\r\nof all literary energies, outside the minstrel class, in neo-Latin.\r\nIt was not until the twelfth century, and as has been said, under\r\nProvençal influence, that secular-minded clerks, and exceptionally\r\neducated nobles, merchants, or officials, began to devote themselves\r\nto the vernacular, and by so doing to develop the _trouvère_ type.\r\nThe _trouvère_ had the advantage of the minstrel in learning and\r\nindependence, if not in leisure; and though the latter long held his\r\nown by the side of his rival, he was fated in the end to give way,\r\nand to content himself with the humbler task of spreading abroad what\r\nthe _trouvère_ wrote[258]. By the second quarter of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, the conquest of literature by the _bourgeoisie_ was complete.\r\nThe interest had shifted from the minstrel on the hall floor to the\r\nburgher or clerk in the _puy_; the prize of a successful poem was no\r\nlonger a royal mantle, but a laureate crown or the golden violet of the\r\n_jeux floraux_; and its destiny less to be recited at the banquet, than\r\nread in the bower. In England the completion of the process perhaps\r\ncame a little later, and was coincident with the triumph of English,\r\nthe tongue of the _bourgeois_, over French, the tongue of the noble.\r\nThe full flower of minstrelsy had been the out-at-elbows vagabond,\r\nRutebeuf. The full flower of the _trouvère_ is the comptroller of the\r\ncustoms and subsidies of the port of London, Geoffrey Chaucer.\r\n\r\nThe first distinction, then, made by Guiraut Riquier, that between\r\n_trobaire_ and _joglar_, implies a development from within minstrelsy\r\nitself that was destined one day to overwhelm it. But the second,\r\nthat between the _joglar_ and the _bufo_, is precisely the one\r\nalready familiar to us, between the minstrels of the _scôp_ and the\r\nminstrels of the _mimus_ tradition. And, as has been said, it is\r\npartly, if not entirely, identical with that which grew up in course\r\nof time between the protected minstrels of the court and of great\r\nmen’s houses, and their vagrant brethren of the road. This general\r\nantithesis between the higher and lower mintrelsy may now, perhaps, be\r\nregarded as established. It was the neglect of it, surely, that led to\r\nthat curious and barren logomachy between Percy and Ritson, in which\r\nneither of the disputants can be said to have had hold of more than a\r\nbare half of the truth[259]. And it runs through the whole history of\r\nminstrelsy. It became acute, no doubt, with the growth in importance\r\nof the minstrels of honour in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.\r\nBut it had probably been just as acute, if not more so, at the very\r\nbeginning of things, when the clash of Teutonic and Roman civilization\r\nfirst brought the bard face to face with the serious rivalry of the\r\nmime. Bard and mime merged without ever becoming quite identical; and\r\neven at the moment when this process was most nearly complete, say in\r\nthe eleventh century, the _jouglerie seigneuriale_, to use Magnin’s\r\nhappy terms, was never quite the same thing as the _jouglerie foraine\r\net populaire_[260], least of all in a country like England where\r\ndifferences of tongue went to perpetuate and emphasize the breach.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the antithesis may easily be pushed too far. After\r\nall, the minstrels were entertainers, and therefore their business\r\nwas to entertain. Did the lord yawn over a gest or a saintly legend?\r\nthe discreet minstrel would be well advised to drop high art, and\r\nto substitute some less exacting, even if less refined fashion of\r\npassing the time. The instincts of boor and baron were not then, of\r\ncourse, so far apart as they are nowadays. And as a matter of fact\r\nwe find many of the most eminent minstrels boasting of the width\r\nand variety of their accomplishments. Thus of Baudouin II, count of\r\nGuisnes (1169-1206), it is recorded that he might have matched the most\r\ncelebrated professionals, not only in _chansons de gestes_ and _romans\r\nd’aventure_ but also in the _fabliaux_ which formed the delight of the\r\nvulgar _bourgeoisie_[261]. Less aristocratic performers descended even\r\nlower than Baudouin de Guisnes. If we study the répertoires of such\r\n_jougleurs_ as the diabolic one in Gautier de Coincy’s miracle[262],\r\nor Daurel in the romance of _Daurel et Beton_[263], or the disputants\r\nwho vaunt their respective proficiencies in _Des Deus Bordeors\r\nRibauz_[264], we shall find that they cover not only every conceivable\r\nform of minstrel literature proper, but also tricks with knives and\r\nstrings, sleight of hand, dancing and tumbling. Even in Provence, the\r\n_Enseignamens_ for _joglars_ warn their readers to learn the arts of\r\nimitating birds, throwing knives, leaping through hoops, showing off\r\nperforming asses and dogs, and dangling marionettes[265]. So that one\r\ndiscerns the difference between the lower and the higher minstrels to\r\nhave been not so much that the one did not sink so low, as that the\r\nother, for lack of capacity and education, did not rise so high.\r\n\r\nThe palmy days of minstrelsy were the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth\r\ncenturies. The germ of decay, however, which appeared when the\r\nseparation grew up between _trouvère_ and _jougleur_, and when men\r\nbegan to read books instead of listening to recitations, was further\r\ndeveloped by the invention of printing. For then, while the _trouvère_\r\ncould adapt himself readily enough to the new order of things, the\r\n_jougleur’s_ occupation was gone. Like Benedick he might still be\r\ntalking, but nobody marked him. Eyes cast down over a page of Chaucer\r\nor of Caxton had no further glitter or tear for him to win[266]. The\r\nfifteenth, and still more the sixteenth century, witness the complete\r\nbreak-up of minstrelsy in its mediaeval form. The mimes of course\r\nendured. They survived the overthrow of mediaevalism, as they had\r\nsurvived the overthrow of the Empire[267]. The Tudor kings and nobles\r\nhad still their jugglers, their bearwards, their domestic buffoons,\r\njesters or fools[268]. Bearbaiting in Elizabethan London rivalled the\r\ndrama in its vogue. Acrobats and miscellaneous entertainers never\r\nceased to crowd to every fair, and there is applause even to-day\r\nin circus and music-hall for the old jests and the old somersaults\r\nthat have already done duty for upwards of twenty centuries. But the\r\n_jougleur_ as the thirteenth century knew him was by the sixteenth\r\ncentury no more. Professional musicians there were in plenty; ‘Sneak’s\r\nnoise’ haunted the taverns of Eastcheap[269], and instrumentalists\r\nand vocalists in royal palaces and noble mansions still kept the name\r\nand style of minstrels. But they were not minstrels in the old sense,\r\nfor with the production of literature, except perhaps for a song here\r\nand there, they had no longer anything to do. That had passed into\r\nother hands, and even the lineaments of the _trouvère_ are barely\r\nrecognizable in the new types of poets and men of letters whom the\r\nRenaissance produced. The old fashioned minstrel in his style and habit\r\nas he lived, was to be presented before Elizabeth at Kenilworth as an\r\ninteresting anachronism[270]. Some of the discarded entertainers, as we\r\nshall see, were absorbed into the growing profession of stage-players;\r\nothers sunk to be ballad singers. For to the illiterate the\r\nstory-teller still continued to appeal. The ballad indeed, at least on\r\none side of it, was the _detritus_, as the _lai_ had been the germ, of\r\nromance[271], and at the very moment when Spenser was reviving romance\r\nas a conscious archaism, it was still possible for a blind fiddler with\r\na ballad to offend the irritable susceptibilities of a Puritan, or to\r\ntouch the sensitive heart-strings of a Sidney[272]. But as a social and\r\nliterary force, the glory of minstrelsy had departed[273].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                        THE MINSTREL REPERTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe floor of a mediaeval court, thronged with minstrels of every\r\ndegree, provided at least as various an entertainment as the Roman\r\nstage itself[274]. The performances of the mimes, to the accompaniment\r\nof their despised tabor or wry-necked fife, undoubtedly made up in\r\nversatility for what they lacked in decorum. There were the _tombeors_,\r\n_tombesteres_ or _tumbleres_, acrobats and contortionists, who\r\ntwisted themselves into incredible attitudes, leapt through hoops,\r\nturned somersaults, walked on their heads, balanced themselves in\r\nperilous positions. Female tumblers, _tornatrices_, took part in these\r\nfeats, and several districts had their own characteristic modes of\r\ntumbling, such as _le tour français_, _le tour romain_, _le tour de\r\nChampenois_[275]. Amongst the _tombeors_ must be reckoned the rarer\r\n_funambuli_ or rope-walkers, such as he whom the Corvei annals record\r\nto have met with a sorry accident in the twelfth century[276], or he\r\nwho created such a _furore_ in the thirteenth by his aerial descent\r\nfrom the cathedral at Basle[277]. Nor are they very distinct from the\r\ncrowd of dancers, male and female, who are variously designated as\r\n_saltatores_ and _saltatrices_, ‘sautours,’ ‘sailyours,’ ‘hoppesteres.’\r\nIndeed, in many mediaeval miniatures, the daughter of Herodias, dancing\r\nbefore Herod, is represented rather as tumbling or standing on her head\r\nthan in any more subtle pose[278]. A second group includes the jugglers\r\nin the narrower sense, the _jouers des costeax_ who tossed and caught\r\nknives and balls[279], and the practitioners of sleight of hand, who\r\ngenerally claimed to proceed by _nigremance_ or sorcery[280]. The two\r\nseem to have shared the names of _prestigiatores_ or _tregetours_[281].\r\nOther mimes, the _bastaxi_, or _jouers des basteax_, brought round,\r\nlike the Punch and Judy men of our own day, little wooden performing\r\npuppets or marionettes[282]. Others, to whom Thomas de Cabham more\r\nparticularly refers, came in masked as animals, and played the dog, the\r\nass or the bird with appropriate noises and behaviour[283]. Others,\r\nagain, led round real animals; generally bears or apes, occasionally\r\nalso horses, cocks, hares, dogs, camels and even lions[284]. Sometimes\r\nthese beasts did tricks; too often they were baited[285], and from\r\ntime to time a man, lineal descendant of the imperial gladiators,\r\nwould step forward to fight with them[286]. To the gladiatorial shows\r\nmay perhaps also be traced the fight with wooden swords which often\r\nformed a part of the fun[287]. And, finally, whatever the staple of\r\nthe performance, there was the _parade_ or preliminary patter to call\r\nthe audience together, and throughout the ‘carping,’ a continuous\r\nflow of rough witticism and repartee, such as one is accustomed to\r\nhear Joey, the clown, in the pauses of a circus, pass off on Mr.\r\nHarris, the ring-master[288]. Here came in the especial talents of the\r\n_scurra_, _bordeor_ or _japere_, to whom the moralists took such marked\r\nexception. ‘_L’uns fet l’ivre, l’autre le sot_’ says the _fabliau_; and\r\nindeed we do not need the testimony of Thomas de Cabham or of John of\r\nSalisbury to conclude that such buffoonery was likely to be of a ribald\r\ntype[289].\r\n\r\nEven in the high places of minstrelsy there was some measure of\r\nvariety. A glance at the pay-sheet of Edward I’s Whitsuntide feast\r\nwill show that the minstrels who aspired to be musicians were\r\nhabitually distinguished by the name of the musical instrument on which\r\nthey played. They are _vidulatores_, _citharistae_, _trumpatores_,\r\n_vilours_, _gigours_, _crouderes_, _harpours_, _citolers_, _lutours_,\r\n_trumpours_, _taboreurs_ and the like. The harp (_cithara_), played\r\nby twitching the strings, had been the old instrument of the Teutons,\r\nbut in the Middle Ages it came second in popularity to the _vielle_\r\n(_vidula_), which was also a string instrument, but, like the modern\r\nfiddle, was played with a bow. The drum (_tympanum_, _tabour_) was,\r\nas we have seen, somewhat despised, and relegated to the mimes. The\r\ntrumpeters appear less often singly than in twos and threes, and it\r\nis possible that their performances may have been mainly ceremonial\r\nand of a purely instrumental order. But the use of music otherwise\r\nthan to accompany the voice does not seem to have gone, before the\r\nend of the thirteenth century, much beyond the signals, flourishes\r\nand fanfares required for wars, triumphs and processions. Concerted\r\ninstrumental music was a later development[290]. The ordinary function\r\nof the harp or _vielle_ in minstrelsy was to assist the voice of\r\nthe minstrel in one of the many forms of poetry which the middle\r\nages knew. These were both lyric and narrative. The distinction is\r\nroughly parallel to that made by Thomas de Cabham when he subdivides\r\nhis highest grades of minstrels into those who sing wanton songs at\r\ntaverns, and those more properly called _ioculatores_ who solace the\r\nhearts of men with reciting the deeds of the heroes and the lives\r\nof the saints. The themes of mediaeval lyric, as of all lyric, are\r\nlargely wantonness and wine; but it must be borne in mind that Thomas\r\nde Cabham’s classification is primarily an ethical one, and does not\r\nnecessarily imply any marked difference of professional status between\r\nthe two classes. The haunters of taverns and the solacers of the\r\nvirtuous were after all the same minstrels, or at least minstrels of\r\nthe same order. That the _chansons_, in their innumerable varieties,\r\ncaught up from folk-song, or devised by Provençal ingenuity, were\r\nlargely in the mouths of the minstrels, may be taken for granted. It\r\nwas here, however, that the competition of _trobaire_ and _trouvère_\r\nbegan earliest, and proved most triumphant, and the supreme minstrel\r\n_genre_ was undoubtedly the narrative. This was, in a sense, their\r\ncreation, and in it they held their own, until the laity learned to\r\nread and the _trouvères_ became able to eke out the shortness of their\r\nmemories by writing down or printing their stories. With narrative,\r\nno doubt, the minstrels of highest repute mainly occupied themselves.\r\nHarp or _vielle_ in hand they beguiled many a long hour for knight\r\nand _châtelaine_ with the interminable _chansons de gestes_ in honour\r\nof Charlemagne and his heroic band[291], or, when the vogue of these\r\nwaned, as in time it did, with the less primitive _romans d’aventure_,\r\nof which those that clustered round the Keltic Arthur were the widest\r\nfamed. Even so their repertory was not exhausted. They had _lais_,\r\n_dits_ and _contes_ of every kind; the devout _contes_ that Thomas de\r\nCabham loved, historical _contes_, romantic _contes_ of less alarming\r\nproportions than the genuine _romans_. And for the _bourgeoisie_ they\r\nhad those improper, witty _fabliaux_, so racy of the French soil, in\r\nwhich the _esprit gaulois_, as we know it, found its first and not its\r\nleast characteristic expression. In most of these types the music of\r\nthe instrument bore its part. The shorter _lais_ were often accompanied\r\nmusically throughout[292]. The longer poems were delivered in a chant\r\nor recitative, the monotony of which was broken at intervals by a\r\nphrase or two of intercalated melody, while during the rest of the\r\nperformance a few perfunctory notes served to sustain the voice[293].\r\nAnd at times, especially in the later days of minstrelsy, the harp\r\nor _vielle_ was laid aside altogether, and the singer became a mere\r\nstory-teller. The antithesis, no infrequent one, between minstrel,\r\nand _fabulator_, _narrator_, _fableor_, _conteor, estour_, _disour_,\r\n_segger_, though all these are themselves elsewhere classed as\r\nminstrels, sufficiently suggests this[294]. It was principally, one may\r\nsurmise, the _dits_ and _fabliaux_ that lent themselves to unmusical\r\nnarration; and when prose crept in, as in time it did, even before\r\nreading became universal, it can hardly have been sung. An interesting\r\nexample is afforded by _Aucassin et Nicolete_, which is what is known\r\nas a _cantefable_. That is to say, it is written in alternate sections\r\nof verse and prose. The former have, in the Paris manuscript, a musical\r\naccompaniment, and are introduced with the words ‘_Or se cante_’; the\r\nlatter have no music, and the introduction ‘_Or content et dient et\r\nfablent_.’\r\n\r\nA further differentiation amongst minstrels was of linguistic origin.\r\nThis was especially apparent in England. The mime is essentially\r\ncosmopolitan. In whatever land he finds himself the few sentences of\r\npatter needful to introduce his _tour_ or his _nigremance_ are readily\r\npicked up. It is not so with any entertainer whose performances claim\r\nto rank, however humbly, as literature. And the Conquest in England\r\nbrought into existence a class of minstrels who, though they were by\r\nno means mimes, were yet obliged to compete with mimes, making their\r\nappeal solely to the _bourgeoisie_ and the peasants, because their\r\nspeech was not that of the Anglo-Norman lords and ladies who formed the\r\nmore profitable audiences of the castles. The native English gleemen\r\nwere eclipsed at courts by the Taillefers and Raheres of the invading\r\nhost. But they still held the road side by side with their rivals,\r\nshorn of their dignities, and winning a precarious livelihood from\r\nthe shrunken purses of those of their own blood and tongue[295]. It\r\nwas they who sang the unavailing heroisms of Hereward, and, if we may\r\njudge by the scanty fragments and records that have come down to us,\r\nthey remained for long the natural focus and mouthpiece of popular\r\ndiscontent and anti-court sentiment. In the reign of Edward III a\r\ngleeman of this type, Laurence Minot, comes to the front, voicing the\r\nspirit of an England united in its nationalism by the war against\r\nFrance; the rest are, for the most part, nameless[296]. Naturally the\r\nEnglish gleemen did not remain for ever a proscribed and isolated folk.\r\nOne may suspect that at the outset many of them became bilingual. At\r\nany rate they learnt to mingle with their Anglo-Norman _confrères_:\r\nthey borrowed the themes of continental minstrelsy; translating\r\n_roman_, _fabliau_ and _chanson_ into the metres and dialects of the\r\nvernacular; and had their share in that gradual fusion of the racial\r\nelements of the land, whose completion was the preparation for Chaucer.\r\n\r\nBesides the Saxons, there were the Kelts. In the provinces of France\r\nthat bordered on Armorica, in the English counties that marched\r\nwith Wales, the Keltic harper is no unusual or negligible figure.\r\nWhether such minstrels ranked very high in the bardic hierarchy of\r\ntheir own peoples may be doubted; but amid alien folk they achieved\r\npopularity[297]. Both Giraldus Cambrensis and Thomas the author\r\nof _Tristan_ speak of a certain _famosus fabulator_ of this class,\r\nBledhericus or Breri by name[298]. Through Breri and his like the\r\nKeltic traditions filtered into Romance literature, and an important\r\nbody of scholars are prepared to find in _lais_ sung to a Welsh or\r\nBreton harp the _origines_ of Arthurian romance[299]. In England the\r\nWelsh, like the English-speaking minstrels, had a political, as well\r\nas a literary significance. They were the means by which the spirit\r\nof Welsh disaffection under English rule was kept alive, and at times\r\nfanned into a blaze. The fable of the massacre of the bards by Edward\r\nI is now discredited, but an ordinance of his against Keltic ‘bards\r\nand rhymers’ is upon record, and was subsequently repeated under Henry\r\nIV[300].\r\n\r\nAn important question now presents itself. How far, in this\r\nheterogeneous welter of mediaeval minstrelsy, is it possible to\r\ndistinguish any elements which can properly be called dramatic? The\r\nminstrels were entertainers in many _genres_. Were they also actors?\r\nAn answer may be sought first of all in their literary remains. The\r\nfirst condition of drama is dialogue, and dialogue is found both in\r\nlyric and in narrative minstrelsy. Naturally, it is scantiest in lyric.\r\nBut there is a group of _chansons_ common to northern France and to\r\nsouthern France or Provence, which at least tended to develop in this\r\ndirection. There are the _chansons à danser_, which are frequently\r\na semi-dialogue between a soloist and a chorus, the one singing the\r\nverses, the other breaking into a burden or refrain. There are the\r\n_chansons à personnages_ or _chansons de mal mariée_, complaints of\r\nunhappy wives, which often take the form of a dialogue between the\r\nwoman and her husband, her friend or, it may be, the poet, occasionally\r\nthat of a discussion on courtly love in general. There are the _aubes_,\r\nof which the type is the morning dialogue between woman and lover\r\nadapted by Shakespeare with such splendid effect in the third act of\r\n_Romeo and Juliet_. And finally there are the _pastourelles_, which are\r\ngenerally dialogues between a knight and a shepherdess, in which the\r\nknight makes love and, successful or repulsed, rides away. All these\r\n_chansons_, like the _chansons d’histoire_ or _de toile_, which did\r\nnot develop into dialogues, are, in the form in which we have them, of\r\nminstrel origin. But behind them are probably folk-songs of similar\r\ncharacter, and M. Gaston Paris is perhaps right in tracing them to the\r\n_fêtes du mai_, those agricultural festivals of immemorial antiquity\r\nin which women traditionally took so large a part. A further word will\r\nhave to be said of their ultimate contribution to drama in a future\r\nchapter[301].\r\n\r\nOther lyrical dialogues of very different type found their way into\r\nthe literature of northern France from that of Provence. These were\r\nthe elaborate disputes about abstract questions, generally of love,\r\nso dear to the artistic and scholastic mind of the _trobaire_. There\r\nwas the _tenson_ (Fr. _tençon_) in which two speakers freely discussed\r\na given subject, each taking the point of view which seems good to\r\nhim. And there was the _joc-partitz_ or _partimen_ (Fr. _jeu-parti_\r\nor _parture_), in which the challenger proposed a theme, indicated\r\ntwo opposed attitudes towards it, and gave his opponent his choice\r\nto maintain one or other[302]. Originally, no doubt the _tensons_\r\nand the _jocs-partitz_ were, as they professed to be, improvised\r\nverbal tournaments: afterwards they became little more than academic\r\nexercises[303]. To the drama they have nothing to say.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue elements in lyric minstrelsy thus exhausted, we turn to\r\nthe wider field of narrative. But over the greater space of this field\r\nwe look in vain. If there is anything of dialogue in the _chansons de\r\ngestes_ and the _romans_ it is merely reported dialogue such as every\r\nform of narrative poetry contains, and is not to the purpose. It is not\r\nuntil we come to the humbler branches of narrative, the unimportant\r\n_contes_ and _dits_, that we find ourselves in the presence of dialogue\r\nproper. _Dits_ and _fabliaux dialogués_ are not rare[304]. There is the\r\nalready quoted _Deus Bordeors Ribauz_ in which two _jougleurs_ meet\r\nand vaunt in turn their rival proficiencies in the various branches of\r\ntheir common art[305]. There is Rutebeuf’s _Charlot et le Barbier_,\r\na similar ‘flyting’ between two gentlemen of the road[306]. There is\r\n_Courtois d’Arras_, a version of the Prodigal Son story[307]. There\r\nis _Le Roi d’Angleterre et le Jongleur d’Ely_, a specimen of witty\r\nminstrel repartee, of which more will be said immediately. These\r\ndialogues naturally tend to become of the nature of disputes, and they\r\nmerge into that special kind of _dit_, the _débat_ or _disputoison_\r\nproper. The _débat_ is a kind of poetical controversy put into the\r\nmouths of two types or two personified abstractions, each of which\r\npleads the cause of its own superiority, while in the end the decision\r\nis not infrequently referred to an umpire in the fashion familiar in\r\nthe eclogues of Theocritus[308]. The _débats_ thus bear a strong\r\nresemblance to the lyric _tençons_ and _jeux-partis_ already mentioned.\r\nLike the _chansons_, they probably owe something to the folk festivals\r\nwith their ‘flytings’ and seasonal songs. In any case they are common\r\nground to minstrelsy and to the clerkly literature of the Middle Ages.\r\nMany of the most famous of them, such as the _Débat de l’Hiver et de\r\nl’Été_, the _Débat du Vin et de l’Eau_, the _Débat du Corps et de\r\nl’Âme_, exist in neo-Latin forms, the intermediaries being naturally\r\nenough those _vagantes_ or wandering scholars, to whom so much of the\r\ninteraction of learned and of popular literature must be due[309]. And\r\nin their turn many of the _débats_ were translated sooner or later into\r\nEnglish. English literature, indeed, had had from Anglo-Saxon days a\r\nnatural affinity for the dialogue form[310], and presents side by\r\nside with the translated _débats_ others--_strifs_ or _estrifs_ is the\r\nEnglish term--of native origin[311]. The thirteenth-century _Harrowing\r\nof Hell_ is an _estrif_ on a subject familiar in the miracle plays:\r\nand for an early miracle play it has sometimes been mistaken[312]. Two\r\nor three other _estrifs_ of English origin are remarkable, because the\r\ninterlocutors are not exactly abstractions, but species of birds and\r\nanimals[313].\r\n\r\nDialogue then, in one shape or another, was part of the minstrel’s\r\nregular stock-in-trade. But dialogue by itself is not drama. The notion\r\nof drama does not, perhaps, necessarily imply scenery on a regular\r\nstage, but it does imply impersonation and a distribution of rôles\r\nbetween at least two performers. Is there anything to be traced in\r\nminstrelsy that satisfies these conditions? So far as impersonation is\r\nconcerned, there are several scattered notices which seem to show that\r\nit was not altogether unknown. In the twelfth century for instance,\r\nÆlred, abbot of Rievaulx, commenting on certain unpleasing innovations\r\nin the church services of the day, complains that the singers use\r\ngestures just like those of _histriones_, fit rather for a _theatrum_\r\nthan for a house of prayer[314]. The word _theatrum_ is, however, a\r\nlittle suspicious, for an actual theatre in the twelfth century is\r\nhardly thinkable, and with a learned ecclesiastic one can never be sure\r\nthat he is not drawing his illustrations rather from his knowledge of\r\nclassical literature than from the real life around him. It is more\r\nconclusive, perhaps, when _fabliaux_ or _contes_ speak of minstrels as\r\n‘doing’ _l’ivre_, or _le cat_, or _le sot_[315]; or when it appears\r\nfrom contemporary accounts that at a performance in Savoy the manners\r\nof England and Brittany were mimicked[316]. In Provence _contrafazedor_\r\nseems to have been a regular name for a minstrel[317]; and the facts\r\nthat the minstrels wore masks ‘with intent to deceive’[318], and were\r\nforbidden to wear ecclesiastical dresses[319], also point to something\r\nin the way of rudimentary impersonation.\r\n\r\nAs for the distribution of rôles, all that can be said, so far as the\r\n_débats_ and _dits dialogués_ go, is, that while some of them may\r\nconceivably have been represented by more than one performer, none\r\nof them need necessarily have been so, and some of them certainly\r\nwere not. There is generally a narrative introduction and often a\r\nsprinkling of narrative interspersed amongst the dialogue. These parts\r\nmay have been pronounced by an _auctor_ or by one of the interlocutors\r\nacting as _auctor_, and some such device must have been occasionally\r\nnecessitated in the religious drama. But there is really no difficulty\r\nin supposing the whole of these pieces to have been recited by a single\r\nminstrel with appropriate changes of gesture and intonation, and in\r\n_The Harrowing of Hell_, which begins ‘A strif will I tellen of,’ this\r\nwas clearly the case. The evidences of impersonation given above are of\r\ncourse quite consistent with such an arrangement; or, for the matter of\r\nthat, with sheer monologue. The minstrel who recited Rutebeuf’s _Dit\r\nde l’Erberie_ may readily be supposed to have got himself up in the\r\ncharacter of a quack[320].\r\n\r\nBut the possibilities of secular mediaeval drama are not quite\r\nexhausted by the _débats_ and _dits dialogués_. For after all, the\r\nwritten literature which the minstrels have left us belongs almost\r\nentirely to those higher _strata_ of their complex fraternity which\r\nderived from the thoroughly undramatic Teutonic _scôp_. But if\r\nmediaeval farce there were, it would not be here that we should look\r\nfor it. It would belong to the inheritance, not of the _scôp_, but of\r\nthe _mimus_. The Roman _mimus_ was essentially a player of farces;\r\nthat and little else. It is of course open to any one to suppose that\r\nthe _mimus_ went down in the seventh century playing farces, and that\r\nhis like appeared in the fifteenth century playing farces, and that\r\nnot a farce was played between. But is it not more probable on the\r\nwhole that, while occupying himself largely with other matters, he\r\npreserved at least the rudiments of the art of acting, and that when\r\nthe appointed time came, the despised and forgotten farce, under the\r\nstimulus of new conditions, blossomed forth once more as a vital and\r\neffective form of literature? In the absence of data we are reduced\r\nto conjecture. But the mere absence of data itself does not render\r\nthe conjecture untenable. For if such rudimentary, or, if you please,\r\ndegenerate farces as I have in mind, ever existed in the Middle Ages,\r\nthe chances were all against their literary survival. They were\r\nassuredly very brief, very crude, often improvised, and rarely, if\r\never, written down. They belonged to an order of minstrels far below\r\nthat which made literature[321]. And one little bit of evidence which\r\nhas not yet been brought forward seems to point to the existence of\r\nsomething in the way of a secular as well as a religious mediaeval\r\ndrama. In the well-known Wyclifite sermon against miracle plays, an\r\nimaginary opponent of the preacher’s argument is made to say that after\r\nall it is ‘lesse yvels that thei have thyre recreaceon by pleyinge of\r\nmyraclis than bi pleyinge of other japis’; and again that ‘to pley in\r\nrebaudye’ is worse than ‘to pley in myriclis[322].’ Now, there is of\r\ncourse no necessary dramatic connotation either in the word ‘pley’ or\r\nin the word ‘japis,’ which, like ‘bourde’ or ‘gab’ is frequently used\r\nof any kind of rowdy merriment, or of the lower types of minstrelsy in\r\ngeneral[323]. But on the other hand the whole tone of the passage seems\r\nto draw a very close parallel between the ‘japis’ and the undeniably\r\ndramatic ‘myriclis,’ and to imply something in the former a little\r\nbeyond the mere recitation, even with the help of impersonation, of a\r\nsolitary mime.\r\n\r\nSuch rude farces or ‘japis’ as we are considering, if they formed\r\npart of the travelling equipment of the humbler mimes, could only\r\nget into literature by an accident; in the event, that is to say, of\r\nsome minstrel of a higher class taking it into his head to experiment\r\nin the form or to adapt it to the purposes of his own art. And this\r\nis precisely what appears to have happened. A very natural use of\r\nthe farce would be in the _parade_ or preliminary patter, merely\r\nabout himself and his proficiency, which at all times has served the\r\nitinerant entertainer as a means whereby to attract his audiences.\r\nAnd just as the very similar _boniment_ or patter of the mountebank\r\ncharlatan at a fair became the model for Rutebeuf’s _Dit de l’Erberie_,\r\nso the _parade_ may be traced as the underlying motive of other _dits_\r\nor _fabliaux_. The _Deus Bordeors Ribauz_ is itself little other than a\r\nglorified _parade_, and another, very slightly disguised, may be found\r\nin the discomfiture of the king by the characteristic repartees of the\r\nwandering minstrel in _Le Roi d’Angleterre et le Jougleur d’Ely_[324].\r\nThe _parade_, also, seems to be the origin of a certain familiar type\r\nof dramatic prologue in which the author or the presenters of a play\r\nappear in their own persons. The earliest example of this is perhaps\r\nthat enigmatic _Terentius et Delusor_ piece which some have thought to\r\npoint to a representation of Terence somewhere in the dark ages between\r\nthe seventh and the eleventh century[325]. And there is a later one in\r\nthe _Jeu du Pèlerin_ which was written about 1288 to precede Adan de la\r\nHale’s _Jeu de Robin et Marion_.\r\n\r\nThe renascence of farce in the fifteenth century will call for\r\nconsideration in a later chapter. It is possible that, as is here\r\nsuggested, that renascence was but the coming to light again of an\r\nearth-bourne of dramatic tradition that had worked its way beneath\r\nthe ground ever since the theatres of the Empire fell. In any case,\r\nrare documents of earlier date survive to show that it was at least\r\nno absolutely sudden and unprecedented thing. The _jeux_ of Adan de\r\nla Hale, indeed, are somewhat irrelevant here. They were not farces,\r\nand will fall to be dealt with in the discussion of the popular\r\n_fêtes_ from which they derive their origin[326]. But the French\r\nfarce of _Le Garçon et l’Aveugle_, ascribed to the second half of the\r\nthirteenth century, is over a hundred years older than any of its\r\nextant successors[327]. And even more interesting to us, because it is\r\nof English _provenance_ and in the English tongue, is a fragment found\r\nin an early fourteenth-century manuscript of a dramatic version of the\r\npopular mediaeval tale of Dame Siriz[328]. This bears the heading _Hic\r\nincipit interludium de Clerico et Puella_. But the significance of this\r\nfateful word _interludium_ must be left for study at a later period,\r\nwhen the history of the secular drama is resumed from the point at\r\nwhich it must now be dropped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BOOK II\r\n\r\n                              FOLK DRAMA\r\n\r\n    Stultorum infinitus est numerus.\r\n\r\n                              ECCLESIASTES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                       THE RELIGION OF THE FOLK\r\n\r\n    [_Bibliographical Note._--The conversion of heathen England is\r\n    described in the _Ecclesiastical History_ of Bede (C. Plummer,\r\n    _Baedae Opera Historica_, 1896). Stress is laid on the imperfect\r\n    character of the process by L. Knappert, _Le Christianisme et le\r\n    Paganisme dans l’Histoire ecclésiastique de Bède le Vénérable_\r\n    (in _Revue de l’Histoire des Religions_, 1897, vol. xxxv).

Vacandard, _L’Idolatrie dans la\r\n    Gaule_ (in _Revue des Questions historiques_, 1899, vol. lxv).\r\n    Witness is borne to the continued presence of pre-Christian\r\n    elements in the folk-civilization of western Europe both by the\r\n    general results of folk-lore research and by the ecclesiastical\r\n    documents of the early Middle Ages. Of these the most important\r\n    in this respect are--(1) the _Decrees_ of Councils, collected\r\n    generally in P. Labbe and G. Cossart, _Sacrosancta Concilia_\r\n    (1671-2), and J. D. Mansi, _Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et\r\n    amplissima Collectio_ (1759-98), and for England in particular\r\n    in D. Wilkins, _Concilia Magnae Britanniae et Hiberniae_ (1737)\r\n    and A. W. Haddan and W. Stubbs, _Councils and Ecclesiastical\r\n    Documents relating to Great Britain and Ireland_ (1869-78).\r\n    An interesting series of extracts is given by G. Gröber, _Zur\r\n    Volkskunde aus Concilbeschlüssen und Capitularien_ (1894):--(2)\r\n    the _Penitentials_, or catalogues of sins and their penalties\r\n    drawn up for the guidance of confessors.

Grimm, iv. 1737), and the eighth-century\r\n    Frankish pseudo-Augustinian _Homilia de Sacrilegiis_ (ed.\r\n    C. P. Caspari, 1886):--(4) the _Vitae_ of the apostles of\r\n    the West, St. Boniface, St. Columban, St. Gall, and others.\r\n    A critical edition of these is looked for from M.

Saupe, 1891), a list of heathen\r\n    customs probably drawn up in eighth-century Saxony.--The view\r\n    of primitive religion taken in this book is largely, although\r\n    not altogether in detail, that of J. G. Frazer, _The Golden\r\n    Bough_ (1890, 2nd ed. 1900), which itself owes much to E. B.\r\n    Tylor, _Primitive Culture_ (1871); W.

Lang, _Myth, Ritual, and Religion_\r\n    (1887, 2nd ed. 1899), the conclusions of which are somewhat\r\n    modified in the same writer’s _The Making of Religion_ (1898);\r\n    Grant Allen, _The Evolution of the Idea of God_ (1897); E. S.\r\n    Hartland, _The Legend of Perseus_ (1894-6); J. Rhys, _The Origin\r\n    and Growth of Religion as illustrated by Celtic Heathendom_\r\n    (1888). The last of these deals especially with Keltic _data_,\r\n    which may be further studied in H. D’Arbois de Jubainville, _Le\r\n    Cycle mythologique irlandais et la Mythologie celtique_ (1884),\r\n    together with the chapter on _La Religion_ in the same writer’s\r\n    _La Civilisation des Celtes et celle de l’Épopée homérique_\r\n    (1899) and A. Bertrand, _La Religion des Gaulois_ (1897).\r\n    Teutonic religion has been more completely investigated. Recent\r\n    works of authority are E. H. Meyer, _Germanische Mythologie_\r\n    (1891); W. Golther, _Handbuch der germanischen Mythologie_\r\n    (1895); and the article by E. Mogk on _Mythologie_ in H. Paul’s\r\n    _Grundriss der germanischen Philologie_, vol. iii (2nd ed. 1897).\r\n    The collection of material in J. Grimm’s _Teutonic Mythology_\r\n    (transl. J. S. Stallybrass, 1880-8) is still of the greatest\r\n    value. The general facts of early German civilization are\r\n    given by F. B. Gummere, _Germanic Origins_ (1892), and for the\r\n    Aryan-speaking peoples in general by O. Schräder, _Prehistoric\r\n    Antiquities of the Aryan Peoples_ (transl. F. B. Jevons, 1890),\r\n    and _Reallexicon der indo-germanischen Altertumskunde_ (1901).\r\n    In dealing with the primitive calendar I have mainly, but not\r\n    wholly, followed the valuable researches of A. Tille, _Deutsche\r\n    Weihnacht_ (1893) and _Yule and Christmas_ (1899), a scholar the\r\n    loss of whom to this country is one of the lamentable results of\r\n    the recent war.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMinstrelsy was an institution of the folk, no less than of the court\r\nand the _bourgeoisie_. At many a village festival, one may be sure,\r\nthe taberers and buffoons played their conspicuous part, ravishing the\r\nsouls of Dorcas and Mopsa with merry and doleful ballads, and tumbling\r\nthrough their amazing programme of monkey tricks before the ring of\r\nwide-mouthed rustics on the green. Yet the soul and centre of such\r\nrevels always lay, not in these alien professional _spectacula_, but\r\nin other entertainments, home-grown and racy of the soil, wherein the\r\npeasants shared, not as onlookers only, but as performers, even as\r\ntheir fathers and mothers, from immemorial antiquity, had done before\r\nthem. A full consideration of the village _ludi_ is important to the\r\nscheme of the present book for more than one reason. They shared with\r\nthe _ludi_ of the minstrels the hostility of the Church. They bear\r\nwitness, at point after point, to the deep-lying dramatic instincts\r\nof the folk. And their substantial contribution to mediaeval and\r\nRenaissance drama and dramatic _spectacle_ is greater than has been\r\nfully recognized.\r\n\r\nHistorically, the _ludi_ of the folk come into prominence with\r\nthe attacks made upon them by the reforming ecclesiastics of the\r\nthirteenth century and in particular by Robert Grosseteste, bishop\r\nof Lincoln[329]. Between 1236 and 1244 Grosseteste issued a series\r\nof disciplinary pronouncements, in which he condemned many customs\r\nprevalent in his diocese. Amongst these are included miracle plays,\r\n‘scotales’ or drinking-bouts, ‘ram-raisings’ and other contests of\r\nathletic prowess, together with ceremonies known respectively as the\r\n_festum stultorum_ and the _Inductio Maii sive Autumni_[330]. Very\r\nsimilar are the prohibitions contained in the _Constitutions_ (1240)\r\nof Walter de Chanteloup, bishop of Worcester[331]. These particularly\r\nspecify the _ludus de Rege et Regina_, a term which may be taken as\r\ngenerally applicable to the typical English folk-festival, of which\r\nthe _Inductio Maii sive Autumni_, the ‘May-game’ and ‘mell-supper,’\r\nmentioned by Grosseteste, are varieties[332]. Both this _ludus_, in its\r\nvarious forms, and the less strictly popular _festum stultorum_, will\r\nfind ample illustration in the sequel. Walter de Chanteloup also lays\r\nstress upon an aggravation of the _ludi inhonesti_ by the performance\r\nof them in churchyards and other holy places, and on Sundays or the\r\nvigils and days of saints[333].\r\n\r\nThe decrees of the two bishops already cited do not stand alone. About\r\n1250 the University of Oxford found it necessary to forbid the routs\r\nof masked and garlanded students in the churches and open places of\r\nthe city[334]. These appear to have been held in connexion with the\r\nfeasts of the ‘nations’ into which a mediaeval university was divided.\r\nArticles of visitation drawn up in connexion with the provisions of\r\nOxford in 1253 made inquiry as to several of the obnoxious _ludi_ and\r\nas to the measures adopted to check them throughout the country[335].\r\nProhibitions are upon record by the synod of Exeter in 1287[336],\r\nand during the next century by the synod of York in 1367[337], and\r\nby William of Wykeham, bishop of Winchester, in 1384[338]; while\r\nthe denunciations of the rulers of the church find an unofficial\r\necho in that handbook of ecclesiastical morality, Robert Mannyng of\r\nBrunne’s _Handlyng Synne_[339]. There is, however, reason to suppose\r\nthat the attitude thus taken up hardly represents that of the average\r\necclesiastical authority, still less that of the average parish\r\npriest, towards the _ludi_ in question. The condemnatory decrees\r\nshould probably be looked upon as the individual pronouncements of\r\nmen of austere or reforming temper against customs which the laxer\r\ndiscipline of their fellows failed to touch; perhaps it should rather\r\nbe said, which the wiser discipline of their fellows found it better to\r\nregulate than to ban. At any rate there is evidence to show that the\r\nvillage _ludi_, as distinct from the _spectacula_ of the minstrels,\r\nwere accepted, and even to some extent directed, by the Church. They\r\nbecame part of the parochial organization, and were conducted through\r\nthe parochial machinery. Doubtless this was the course of practical\r\nwisdom. But the moralist would find it difficult to deny that Robert\r\nGrosseteste and Walter de Chanteloup had, after all, some reason on\r\ntheir side. On the one hand they could point to the ethical lapses\r\nof which the _ludi_ were undoubtedly the cause--the drunkenness, the\r\nquarrels, the wantonings, by which they were disgraced[340]. And on\r\nthe other they could--if they were historically minded--recall the\r\norigin of the objectionable rites in some of those obscure survivals\r\nof heathenism in the rustic blood, which half a dozen centuries of\r\nChristianity had failed to purge[341]. For if the comparative study\r\nof religions proves anything it is, that the traditional beliefs and\r\ncustoms of the mediaeval or modern peasant are in nine cases out of ten\r\nbut the _detritus_ of heathen mythology and heathen worship, enduring\r\nwith but little external change in the shadow of an hostile creed.\r\nThis is notably true of the village festivals and their _ludi_. Their\r\nfull significance only appears when they are regarded as fragments of\r\nforgotten cults, the naïve cults addressed by a primitive folk to the\r\nbeneficent deities of field and wood and river, or the shadowy populace\r\nof its own dreams. Not that when even the mediaeval peasant set up his\r\nMay-pole at the approach of summer or drove his cattle through the\r\nbonfire on Midsummer eve, the real character of his act was at all\r\nexplicit in his consciousness. To him, as to his descendant of to-day,\r\nthe festival was at once a practice sanctioned by tradition and the\r\nrare amusement of a strenuous life: it was not, save perhaps in some\r\nunplumbed recesses of his being, anything more definitely sacred. At\r\nmost it was held to be ‘for luck,’ and in some vague general way, to\r\nthe interest of a fruitful year in field and fold. The scientific\r\nanthropologist, however, from his very different point of view, cannot\r\nregard the conversion to Christianity as a complete solution of\r\ncontinuity in the spiritual and social life of western Europe. This\r\nconversion, indeed, was clearly a much slower and more incomplete\r\nprocess than the ecclesiastical chroniclers quite plainly state. It\r\nwas so even on the shores of the Mediterranean. But there the triumph\r\nof Christianity began from below. Long before the edict of Milan, the\r\nnew religion, in spite of persecutions, had got its firm hold upon\r\nthe masses of the great cities of the Empire. And when, less than a\r\ncentury later, Theodosius made the public profession of any other faith\r\na crime, he was but formally acknowledging a _chose jugée_. But even in\r\nthese lands of the first ardour the old beliefs and, above all, the old\r\nrituals died hard. Lingering unacknowledged in the country, the pagan,\r\ndistricts, they passed silently into the dim realm of folk-lore. How\r\ncould this but be more so when Christianity came with the missionaries\r\nof Rome or of Iona to the peoples of the West? For with them conversion\r\nwas hardly a spontaneous, an individual thing. As a rule, the baptism\r\nof the king was the starting-point and motive for that of his\r\nfollowers: and the bulk of the people adopted wonderingly an alien cult\r\nin an alien tongue imposed upon them by the will of their rulers. Such\r\na Christianity could at best be only nominal. Ancient beliefs are not\r\nso easily surrendered: nor are habits and instincts, deep-rooted in\r\nthe lives of a folk, thus lightly laid down for ever, at the word of a\r\nking. The churches of the West had, therefore, to dispose somehow of a\r\nvast body of practical heathenism surviving in all essentials beneath\r\na new faith which was but skin-deep. The conflict which followed is\r\nfaintly adumbrated in the pages of Bede: something more may be guessed\r\nof its fortunes by a comparison of the customs and superstitions\r\nrecorded in early documents of church discipline with those which,\r\nafter all, the peasantry long retained, or even now retain.\r\n\r\nTwo letters of Gregory the Great, written at the time of the mission of\r\nSt. Augustine, are a key to the methods adopted by the apostles of the\r\nWest. In June 601, writing to Ethelbert of Kent by the hands of abbot\r\nMellitus, Gregory bade the new convert show zeal in suppressing the\r\nworship of idols, and throwing down their fanes[342]. Having written\r\nthus, the pope changed his mind. Before Mellitus could reach England,\r\nhe received a letter instructing him to expound to Augustine a new\r\npolicy. ‘Do not, after all,’ wrote Gregory, ‘pull down the fanes.\r\nDestroy the idols; purify the buildings with holy water; set relics\r\nthere; and let them become temples of the true God. So the people will\r\nhave no need to change their places of concourse, and where of old\r\nthey were wont to sacrifice cattle to demons, thither let them continue\r\nto resort on the day of the saint to whom the church is dedicated, and\r\nslay their beasts no longer as a sacrifice, but for a social meal in\r\nhonour of Him whom they now worship[343].’ There can be little doubt\r\nthat the conversion of England proceeded in the main on the lines thus\r\nlaid down by Gregory. Tradition has it that the church of Saint Pancras\r\noutside the walls of Canterbury stands on the site of a fane at which\r\nEthelbert himself once worshipped[344]; and that in London St. Paul’s\r\nreplaced a temple and grove of Diana, by whom the equivalent Teutonic\r\nwood-goddess, Freyja, is doubtless intended[345]. Gregory’s directions\r\nwere, perhaps, not always carried out quite so literally as this. When,\r\nfor instance, the priest Coifi, on horseback and sword in hand, led\r\nthe onslaught against the gods of Northumbria, he bade his followers\r\nset fire to the fane and to all the hedges that girt it round[346]. On\r\nthe other hand, Reduald, king of East Anglia, must have kept his fane\r\nstanding, and indeed he carried the policy of amalgamation further\r\nthan its author intended, for he wavered faint-heartedly between the\r\nold religion and the new, and maintained in one building an _altare_\r\nfor Christian worship and an _arula_ for sacrifice to demons[347].\r\nSpeaking generally, it would seem to have been the endeavour of\r\nthe Christian missionaries to effect the change of creed with as\r\nlittle dislocation of popular sentiment as possible. If they could\r\nextirpate the essentials, or what they considered as the essentials,\r\nof heathenism, they were willing enough to leave the accidentals to be\r\nworn away by the slow process of time. They did not, probably, quite\r\nrealize how long it would take. And what happened in England, happened\r\nalso, no doubt, on the continent, save perhaps in such districts as\r\nSaxony, where Christianity was introduced _vi et armis_, and therefore\r\nin a more wholesale, if not in the end a more effectual fashion[348].\r\n\r\nThe measure of surviving heathenism under Christianity must have\r\nvaried considerably from district to district. Much would depend on\r\nthe natural temper of the converts, on the tact of the clergy and on\r\nthe influence they were able to secure. Roughly speaking, the old\r\nworships left their trace upon the new society in two ways. Certain\r\ncentral practices, the deliberate invocation of the discarded gods, the\r\ndeliberate acknowledgement of their divinity by sacrifice, were bound\r\nto be altogether proscribed[349]. And these, if they did not precisely\r\nvanish, at least went underground, coming to light only as shameful\r\nsecrets of the confessional[350] or the witch-trial[351], or when the\r\ndominant faith received a rude shock in times of especial distress,\r\nfamine or pestilence[352]. Others again were absorbed into the scheme\r\nof Christianity itself. Many of the protective functions, for instance,\r\nof the old pantheon were taken over bodily by the Virgin Mary, by St.\r\nJohn, St. Michael, St. Martin, St. Nicholas, and other personages of\r\nthe new dispensation[353]. And in particular, as we have seen shadowed\r\nforth in Pope Gregory’s policy, the festal customs of heathenism,\r\npurified so far as might be, received a generous amount of toleration.\r\nThe chief thing required was that the outward and visible signs of the\r\nconnexion with the hostile religion should be abandoned. Nor was this\r\nsuch a difficult matter. Cult, the sum of what man feels it obligatory\r\nupon him to do in virtue of his relation to the unseen powers, is\r\nnotoriously a more enduring thing than belief, the speculative, or\r\nmythology, the imaginative statement of those relations. And it was\r\nof the customs themselves that the people were tenacious, not of the\r\nmeaning, so far as there was still a meaning, attached to them, or\r\nof the names which their priests had been wont to invoke. Leave them\r\nbut their familiar revels, and the ritual so indissolubly bound up\r\nwith their hopes of fertility for their flocks and crops, they would\r\nnot stick upon the explicit consciousness that they drank or danced\r\nin the might of Eostre or of Freyr. And in time, as the Christian\r\ninterpretation of life became an everyday thing, it passed out of sight\r\nthat the customs had been ritual at all. At the most a general sense\r\nof their ‘lucky’ influence survived. But to stop doing them; that was\r\nnot likely to suggest itself to the rustic mind. And so the church and\r\nthe open space around the church continued to be, what the temple and\r\nthe temple precinct had been, the centre, both secular and religious,\r\nof the village life. From the Christian point of view, the arrangement\r\nhad its obvious advantages. It had also this disadvantage, that so\r\nfar as obnoxious elements still clung to the festivals, so far as the\r\ndarker practices of heathenism still lingered, it was precisely the\r\nmost sacred spot that they defiled. Were incantations and spells still\r\nmuttered secretly for the good will of the deposed divinities? it was\r\nthe churchyard that was sure to be selected as the nocturnal scene of\r\nthe unhallowed ceremony. Were the clergy unable to cleanse the yearly\r\nwake of wanton dance and song? it was the church itself, by Gregory’s\r\nown decree, that became the focus of the riot.\r\n\r\nThe partial survival of the village ceremonies under Christianity will\r\nappear less surprising when it is borne in mind that the heathenism\r\nwhich Christianity combated was itself only the final term of a long\r\nprocess of evolution. The worshippers of the Keltic or Teutonic deities\r\nalready practised a traditional ritual, probably without any very\r\nclear conception of the _rationale_ on which some at least of the acts\r\nwhich they performed were based. These acts had their origin far back\r\nin the history of the religious consciousness; and it must not be\r\nsupposed, because modern scholarship, with its comparative methods, is\r\nable to some extent to reconstruct the mental conditions out of which\r\nthey arose, that these conditions were still wholly operative in the\r\nsixth, any more than in the thirteenth or the twentieth century. Side\r\nby side with customs which had still their definite and intelligible\r\nsignificance, religious conservatism had certainly preserved others\r\nof a very primitive type, some of which survived as mere fossils,\r\nwhile others had undergone that transformation of intention, that\r\npouring of new wine into old bottles, which is one of the most familiar\r\nfeatures in the history of institutions. The heathenism of western\r\nEurope must be regarded, therefore, as a group of religious practices\r\noriginating in very different strata of civilization, and only fused\r\ntogether in the continuity of tradition. Its permanence lay in the\r\nlaw of association through which a piece of ritual originally devised\r\nby the folk to secure their practical well-being remained, even after\r\nthe initial meaning grew obscure, irrevocably bound up with their\r\nexpectations of that well-being. Its interest to the student is that of\r\na development, rather than that of a system. Only the briefest outline\r\nof the direction taken by this development can be here indicated. But\r\nit must first be pointed out that, whether from a common derivation,\r\nor through a similar intellectual structure reacting upon similar\r\nconditions of life, it seems, at least up to the point of emergence\r\nof the fully formed village cult, to have proceeded on uniform lines,\r\nnot only amongst the Teutonic and Keltic tribes who inhabited western\r\nand northern Europe and these islands, but also amongst all the\r\nAryan-speaking peoples. In particular, although the Teutonic and the\r\nKeltic priests and bards elaborated, probably in comparatively late\r\nstages of their history, very different god-names and very different\r\nmythologies, yet these are but the superstructure of religion; and it\r\nis possible to infer, both from the results of folk-lore and from the\r\nmore scanty documentary evidence, a substantial identity throughout\r\nthe whole Kelto-Teutonic group, of the underlying institutions\r\nof ritual and of the fundamental theological conceptions[354].\r\nI am aware that it is no longer permissible to sum up all the\r\nfacts of European civilization in an Aryan formula. Ethnology has\r\nsatisfactorily established the existence on the continent of at least\r\ntwo important racial strains besides that of the blonde invader from\r\nLatham-land[355]. But I do not think that any of the attempts hitherto\r\nmade to distinguish Aryan from pre-Aryan elements in folk-lore have\r\nmet with any measure of success[356]. Nor is it quite clear that any\r\nsuch distinction need have been implied by the difference of blood.\r\nArchaeologists speak of a remarkable uniformity of material culture\r\nthroughout the whole of Europe during the neolithic period; and there\r\nappears to be no special reason why this uniformity may not have\r\nextended to the comparatively simple notions which man was led to form\r\nof the not-man by his early contacts with his environment. In any case\r\nthe social amalgamation of Aryan and pre-Aryan was a process already\r\ncomplete by the Middle Ages; and for the purpose of this investigation\r\nit seems justifiable, and in the present state of knowledge even\r\nnecessary, to treat the village customs as roughly speaking homogeneous\r\nthroughout the whole of the Kelto-Teutonic area.\r\n\r\nAn analysis of these customs suggests a mental history somewhat as\r\nfollows. The first relations of man to the not-man are, it need hardly\r\nbe said, of a practical rather than a sentimental or a philosophic\r\ncharacter. They arise out of an endeavour to procure certain goods\r\nwhich depend, in part at least, upon natural processes beyond man’s\r\nown control. The chief of these goods is, of course, food; that is to\r\nsay, in a primitive state of civilization, success in hunting, whether\r\nof berries, mussels and ‘witchetty grubs,’ or of more elusive and\r\ndifficult game; and later, when hunting ceases to be the mainstay of\r\nexistence, the continued fertility of the flocks and herds, which form\r\nthe support of a pastoral race, and of the cornfields and orchards\r\nwhich in their turn come to supplement these, on the appearance of\r\nagriculture. Food once supplied, the little tale of primitive man’s\r\nlimited conception of the desirable is soon completed. Fire and a\r\nroof-tree are his already. But he asks for physical health, for\r\nsuccess in love and in the begetting of offspring, and for the power\r\nto anticipate by divination that future about which he is always so\r\nchildishly curious. In the pursuit, then, of these simple goods man\r\nendeavours to control nature. But his earliest essays in this direction\r\nare, as Dr. Frazer has recently pointed out, not properly to be called\r\nreligion[357]. The magical charms by which he attempts to make the\r\nsun burn, and the waters fall, and the wind blow as it pleases him,\r\ncertainly do not imply that recognition of a quasi-human personality\r\noutside himself, which any religious definition may be supposed to\r\nrequire as a minimum. They are rather to be regarded as applications of\r\nprimitive science, for they depend upon a vague general notion of the\r\nrelations of cause and effect. To assume that you can influence a thing\r\nthrough what is similar to it, or through what has been in contact with\r\nit, which, according to Dr. Frazer, are the postulates of magic in its\r\nmimetic and its sympathetic form respectively, may be bad science, but\r\nat least it is science of a sort, and not religion.\r\n\r\nThe magical charms play a large part in the village ritual, and will\r\nbe illustrated in the following chapter. Presently, however, the\r\nscientific spirit is modified by that tendency of animism through\r\nwhich man comes to look upon the external world not as mere more or\r\nless resisting matter to be moved hither or thither, but rather as a\r\ndebateable land peopled with spirits in some sense alive. These spirits\r\nare the active forces dimly discerned by human imagination as at work\r\nbehind the shifting and often mysterious natural phenomena--forces of\r\nthe moving winds and waters, of the skies now clear, now overcast, of\r\nthe animal races of hill and plain, of the growth waxing and waning\r\nyear by year in field and woodland. The control of nature now means the\r\ncontrol of these powers, and to this object the charms are directed. In\r\nparticular, I think, at this stage of his development, man conceives\r\na spirit of that food which still remains in the very forefront of his\r\naspirations, of his actual food-plant, or of the animal species which\r\nhe habitually hunts[358]. Of this spirit he initiates a cult, which\r\nrests upon the old magical principle of the mastering efficacy of\r\ndirect contact. He binds the spirit literally to him by wearing it as a\r\ngarment, or absorbs it into himself in a solemn meal, hoping by either\r\nprocess to acquire an influence or power over it. Naturally, at this\r\nstage, the spirit becomes to the eye of his imagination phytomorphic or\r\ntheriomorphic in aspect. He may conceive it as especially incarnate in\r\na single sacred plant or animal. But the most critical moment in the\r\nhistory of animism is that at which the elemental spirits come to be\r\nlooked upon as anthropomorphic, made in the likeness of man himself.\r\nThis is perhaps due to the identification of them with those other\r\nquasi-human spirits, of whose existence man has by an independent\r\nline of thought also become aware. These are the ghostly spirits of\r\ndeparted kinsmen, still in some shadowy way inhabiting or revisiting\r\nthe house-place. The change does not merely mean that the visible\r\nphytomorphic and theriomorphic embodiments of mental forces sink into\r\nsubordination; the plants and animals becoming no more than symbols and\r\nappurtenances of the anthropomorphic spirit, or temporary forms with\r\nwhich from time to time he invests himself. A transformation of the\r\nwhole character of the cult is involved, for man must now approach the\r\nspirits, not merely by charms, although conservatism preserves these\r\nas an element in ritual, but with modifications of the modes in which\r\nhe approaches his fellow man. He must beg their favour with submissive\r\nspeech or buy it with bribes. And here, with prayer and oblation,\r\nreligion in the stricter sense makes its appearance.\r\n\r\nThe next step of man is from the crowd of animistic spirits to\r\nisolate the god. The notion of a god is much the old notion of an\r\nanthropomorphic elemental spirit, widened, exalted, and further\r\nremoved from sense. Instead of a local and limited home, the god has\r\nhis dwelling in the whole expanse of heaven or in some distant region\r\nof space. He transcends and as an object of cult supplants the more\r\nbounded and more concrete personifications of natural forces out of\r\nwhich he has been evolved. But he does not annul these: they survive\r\nin popular credence as his servants and ministers. It is indeed on the\r\nanalogy of the position of the human chief amongst his _comitatus_\r\nthat, in all probability, the conception of the god is largely arrived\r\nat. Comparative philology seems to show that the belief in gods is\r\ncommon to the Aryan-speaking peoples, and that at the root of all the\r\ncognate mythologies there lies a single fundamental divinity. This is\r\nthe Dyaus of the Indians, the Zeus of the Greeks, the Jupiter of the\r\nRomans, the Tiwaz (O.H.G. Zîu, O.N. Týr, A.-S. Tîw) of the Teutons.\r\nHe is an embodiment of the great clear sunlit heavens, the dispenser\r\nof light to the huntsman, and of warmth and moisture to the crops.\r\nSide by side with the conception of the heaven-god comes that of his\r\nfemale counterpart, who is also, though less clearly, indicated in\r\nall the mythologies. In her earliest aspect she is the lady of the\r\nwoods and of the blossoming fruitful earth. This primary dualism is an\r\nextremely important factor in the explanation of early religion. The\r\nall-father, the heaven, and the mother-goddess, the earth, are distinct\r\npersonalities from the beginning. It does not appear possible to\r\nresolve one into a mere doublet or derivative of the other. Certainly\r\nthe marriage of earth and heaven in the showers that fertilize the\r\ncrops is one of the oldest and most natural of myths. But it is\r\ngenerally admitted that myth is determined by and does not determine\r\nthe forms of cult. The heaven-god and the earth-goddess must have\r\nalready had their separate existence before the priests could hymn\r\ntheir marriage. An explanation of the dualism is probably to be traced\r\nin the merging of two cults originally distinct. These will have been\r\nsex-cults. Tillage is, of course, little esteemed by primitive man.\r\nIt was so with the Germans, even up to the point at which they first\r\ncame into contact with the Romans[359]. Yet all the Aryan languages\r\nshow some acquaintance with the use of grains[360]. The analogy with\r\nexisting savages suggests that European agriculture in its early stages\r\nwas an affair of the women. While the men hunted or afterwards tended\r\ntheir droves of cattle and horses, the women grubbed for roots, and\r\npresently learnt to scratch the surface of the ground, to scatter the\r\nseed, and painfully to garner and grind the scanty produce[361]. As the\r\navocations of the sexes were distinct, so would their magic or their\r\nreligion be. Each would develop rites of its own of a type strictly\r\ndetermined by its practical ambitions, and each would stand apart from\r\nthe rites of the other. The interest of the men would centre in the\r\nboar or stag, that of the women in the fruit-tree or the wheat-sheaf.\r\nTo the former the stone altar on the open hill-top would be holy; to\r\nthe latter the dim recesses of the impenetrable grove. Presently when\r\nthe god concept appeared, the men’s divinity would be a personification\r\nof the illimitable and mysterious heavens beneath which they hunted\r\nand herded, from which the pools were filled with water, and at times\r\nthe pestilence was darted in the sun rays; the women’s of the wooded\r\nand deep-bosomed earth out of which their wealth sprang. This would\r\nas naturally take a female as that a male form. Agriculture, however,\r\nwas not for ever left solely to the women. In time pasturage and\r\ntillage came to be carried on as two branches of a single pursuit,\r\nand the independent sex-cults which had sprung out of them coalesced\r\nin the common village worship of later days. Certain features of the\r\nprimitive differentiation can still be obscurely distinguished. Here\r\nand there one or the other sex is barred from particular ceremonies,\r\nor a male priest must perform his mystic functions in woman’s garb.\r\nThe heaven-god perhaps remains the especial protector of the cattle,\r\nand the earth-goddess of the corn. But generally speaking they have\r\nall the interests of the farm in a joint tutelage. The stone altar\r\nis set up in the sacred grove; the mystic tree is planted on the\r\nhill-top[362]. Theriomorphic and phytomorphic symbols shadow forth a\r\nsingle godhead[363]. The earth-mother becomes a divinity of light. The\r\nheaven-father takes up his abode in the spreading oak.\r\n\r\nThe historic religions of heathenism have not preserved either the\r\nprimitive dualistic monotheism, if the phrase may be permitted, or\r\nthe simplicity of divine functions here sketched. With the advance of\r\ncivilization the objects of worship must necessarily take upon them new\r\nresponsibilities. If a tribe has its home by the sea, sooner or later\r\nit trusts frail barks to the waters, and to its gods is committed the\r\ncharge of sea-faring. When handicrafts are invented, these also become\r\ntheir care. When the pressure of tribe upon tribe leads to war, they\r\nchampion the host in battle. Moral ideas emerge and attach themselves\r\nto their service: and ultimately they become identified with the rulers\r\nof the dead, and reign in the shadowy world beyond the tomb. Another\r\nset of processes combine to produce what is known as polytheism.\r\nThe constant application of fixed epithets to the godhead tends in\r\nthe long run to break up its unity. Special aspects of it begin to\r\ntake on an independent existence. Thus amongst the Teutonic peoples\r\nTiwaz-Thunaraz, the thunderous sky, gives rise to Thunar or Thor,\r\nand Tiwaz-Frawiaz, the bounteous sky, to Freyr. And so the ancient\r\nheaven-god is replaced by distinct gods of rain and sunshine, who,\r\nwith the mother-goddess, form that triad of divinities so prominent\r\nin several European cults[364]. Again as tribes come into contact\r\nwith each other, there is a borrowing of religious conceptions, and\r\nthe tribal deities are duplicated by others who are really the same\r\nin origin, but have different names. The mythological speculations of\r\npriests and bards cause further elaboration. The friendly national\r\ngods are contrasted with the dark hostile deities of foreign enemies.\r\nA belief in the culture-hero or semi-divine man, who wrests the gifts\r\nof civilization from the older gods, makes its appearance. Certain\r\ncults, such as that of Druidism, become the starting-point for even\r\nmore philosophic conceptions. The personal predilection of an important\r\nworshipper or group of worshippers for this or that deity extends his\r\nvogue. The great event in the later history of Teutonic heathenism is\r\nthe overshadowing of earlier cults by that of Odin or Wodan, who seems\r\nto have been originally a ruler of the dead, or perhaps a culture-hero,\r\nand not an elemental god at all[365]. The multiplicity of forms under\r\nwhich essentially the same divinity presents itself in history and\r\nin popular belief may be illustrated by the mother-goddess of the\r\nTeutons. As Freyja she is the female counterpart of Freyr; as Nerthus\r\nof Freyr’s northern doublet, Njordr. When Wodan largely absorbs the\r\nelemental functions, she becomes his wife, as Frîja or Frigg. Through\r\nher association with the heaven-gods, she is herself a heaven-as well\r\nas an earth-goddess[366], the Eostre of Bede[367], as well as the Erce\r\nof the Anglo-Saxon ploughing charm[368]. She is probably the Tanfana\r\nof Tacitus and the Nehellenia of the Romano-Germanic votive stones. If\r\nso, she must have become a goddess of mariners, for Nehellenia seems to\r\nbe the Isis of the _interpretatio Romana_. As earth-goddess she comes\r\nnaturally into relation with the dead, and like Odin is a leader of the\r\nrout of souls. In German peasant-lore she survives under various names,\r\nof which Perchta is the most important; in witch-lore, as Diana, and\r\nby a curious mediaeval identification, as Herodias[369]. And her more\r\nprimitive functions are largely inherited by the Virgin, by St. Walpurg\r\nand by countless local saints.\r\n\r\nMost of the imaginative and mythological superstructure so briefly\r\nsketched in the last paragraph must be considered as subsequent in\r\norder of development to the typical village cult. Both before and\r\nin more fragmentary shape after the death of the old Keltic and\r\nTeutonic gods, that continued to be in great measure an amalgam of\r\ntraditional rites of forgotten magical or pre-religious import. So\r\nfar as the consciousness of the mediaeval or modern peasant directed\r\nit to unseen powers at all, which was but little, it was rather to\r\nsome of these more local and bounded spirits who remained in the train\r\nof the gods, than to the gods themselves. For the purposes of the\r\npresent discussion, it is sufficient to think of it quite generally\r\nas a cult of the spirits of fertilization, without attaching a very\r\nprecise connotation to that term. Unlike the domestic cult of the\r\nancestral ghosts, conducted for each household by the house-father\r\nat the hearth, it was communal in character. Whatever the tenure of\r\nland may have been, there seems no doubt that up to a late period\r\n‘co-aration,’ or co-operative ploughing in open fields, remained the\r\nnormal method of tillage, while the cattle of the community roamed in\r\ncharge of a public herd over unenclosed pastures and forest lands[370].\r\nThe farm, as a self-sufficing agricultural unit, is a comparatively\r\nrecent institution, the development of which has done much to render\r\nthe village festivals obsolete. Originally the critical moments of\r\nthe agricultural year were the same for the whole village, and the\r\nobservances which they entailed were shared in by all.\r\n\r\nThe observances in question, or rather broken fragments of them, have\r\nnow attached themselves to a number of different outstanding dates in\r\nthe Christian calendar, and the reconstruction of the original year,\r\nwith its seasonal feasts, is a matter of some difficulty[371]. The\r\nearliest year that can be traced amongst the Aryan-speaking peoples\r\nwas a bipartite one, made up of only two seasons, winter and summer.\r\nFor some reason that eludes research, winter preceded summer, just as\r\nnight, in the primitive reckoning, preceded day. The divisions seem to\r\nhave been determined by the conditions of a pastoral existence passed\r\nin the regularly recurring seasons of central Europe. Winter began when\r\nsnow blocked the pastures and the cattle had to be brought home to\r\nthe stall: summer when the grass grew green again and there was once\r\nmore fodder in the open. Approximately these dates would correspond\r\nto mid-November and mid-March[372]. Actually, in the absence of a\r\ncalendar, they would vary a little from year to year and would perhaps\r\ndepend on some significant annual event, such as the first snowstorm\r\nin the one case[373], in the other the appearance of the first violet,\r\nbutterfly or cockchafer, or of one of those migratory birds which still\r\nin popular belief bring good fortune and the summer, the swallow,\r\ncuckoo or stork[374]. Both dates would give occasion for religious\r\nceremonies, together with the natural accompaniment of feasting and\r\nrevel. More especially would this be the case at mid-November, when a\r\ngreat slaughtering of cattle was rendered economically necessary by\r\nthe difficulty of stall-feeding the whole herd throughout the winter.\r\nPresently, however, new conditions established themselves. Agriculture\r\ngrew in importance, and the crops rather than the cattle became the\r\ncentral interest of the village life. Fresh feasts sprang up side by\r\nside with the primitive ones, one at the beginning of ploughing about\r\nmid-February, another at the end of harvest, about mid-September.\r\nAt the same time the increased supply of dry fodder tended to drive\r\nthe annual slaughtering farther on into the winter. More or less\r\ncontemporaneously with these processes, the old bipartite year was\r\nchanged into a tripartite one by the growth of yet another new feast\r\nduring that dangerous period when the due succession of rain and sun\r\nfor the crops becomes a matter of the greatest moment to the farmer.\r\nEarly summer, or spring, was thus set apart from late summer, or summer\r\nproper[375]. This development also may be traced to the influence of\r\nagriculture, whose interest runs in a curve, while that of herding\r\nkeeps comparatively a straight course. But as too much sun or too much\r\nwet not only spoils the crops but brings a murrain on the cattle, the\r\nherdsmen fell into line and took their share in the high summer rites.\r\nAt first, no doubt, this last feast was a sporadic affair, held for\r\npropitiation of the unfavourable fertilization spirits when the elders\r\nof the village thought it called for. And to the end resort may have\r\nbeen had to exceptional acts of cult in times of especial distress. But\r\ngradually the occasional ceremony became an annual one, held as soon\r\nas the corn was thick in the green blade and the critical days were at\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nSo far, there has been no need to assume the existence of a calendar.\r\nHow long the actual climatic conditions continued to determine the\r\ndates of the annual feasts can hardly be said. But when a calendar\r\ndid make its appearance, the five feasts adapted themselves without\r\nmuch difficulty to it. The earliest calendar that can be inferred in\r\ncentral Europe was one, either of Oriental or possibly of Mediterranean\r\n_provenance_, which divided the year into six tides of threescore days\r\neach[376]. The beginnings of these tides almost certainly fell at\r\nabout the middle of corresponding months of the Roman calendar[377].\r\nThe first would thus be marked by the beginning of winter feast in\r\nmid-November; two others by the beginning of summer feast and the\r\nharvest feast in mid-March and mid-August respectively. A little\r\naccommodation of the seasonal feasts of the farm would be required\r\nto adapt them to the remaining three. And here begins a process of\r\ndislocation of the original dates of customs, now becoming traditional\r\nrather than vital, which was afterwards extended by successive stages\r\nto a bewildering degree. By this time, with the greater permanence of\r\nagriculture, the system of autumn ploughing had perhaps been invented.\r\nThe spring ploughing festival was therefore of less importance, and\r\nbore to be shifted back to mid-January instead of mid-February. Four\r\nof the six tides are now provided with initial feasts. These are\r\nmid-November, mid-January, mid-March, and mid-September. There are,\r\nhowever, still mid-May and mid-July, and only the high summer feast\r\nto divide between them. I am inclined to believe that a division is\r\nprecisely what took place, and that the hitherto fluctuating date of\r\nthe summer feast was determined in some localities to mid-May, in\r\nothers to mid-July[378].\r\n\r\nThe European three-score-day-tide calendar is rather an ingenious\r\nconjecture than an ascertained fact of history. When the Germano-Keltic\r\npeoples came under the influence of Roman civilization, they adopted\r\namongst other things the Roman calendar, first in its primitive form\r\nand then in the more scientific one given to it under Julius Caesar.\r\nThe latter divided the year into four quarters and twelve months,\r\nand carried with it a knowledge of the solstices, at which the\r\nastronomy neither of Kelts nor of Germans seems to have previously\r\narrived[379]. The feasts again underwent a process of dislocation\r\nin order to harmonize them with the new arrangement. The ceremonies\r\nof the winter feast were pulled back to November 1 or pushed forward\r\nto January 1. The high summer feast was attracted from mid-May and\r\nmid-July respectively to the important Roman dates of the _Floralia_\r\non May 1 and the summer solstice on June 24. Last of all, to complete\r\nthe confusion, came, on the top of three-score-day-tide calendar\r\nand Roman calendar alike, the scheme of Christianity with its host\r\nof major and minor ecclesiastical festivals, some of them fixed,\r\nothers movable. Inevitably these in their turn began to absorb the\r\nagricultural customs. The present distribution of the five original\r\nfeasts, therefore, is somewhat as follows. The winter feast is spread\r\nover all the winter half of the year from All Souls day to Twelfth\r\nnight. A later chapter will illustrate its destiny more in detail. The\r\nploughing feast is to be sought mainly in Plough Monday, in Candlemas\r\nand in Shrovetide or Carnival[380]; the beginning of summer feast\r\nin Palm Sunday, Easter and St. Mark’s day; the early variety of the\r\nhigh summer feast probably also in Easter, and certainly in May-day,\r\nSt. George’s day, Ascensiontide with its Rogations, Whitsuntide and\r\nTrinity Sunday; the later variety of the same feast in Midsummer day\r\nand Lammastide; and the harvest feast in Michaelmas. These are days\r\nof more or less general observance. Locally, in strict accordance\r\nwith the policy of Gregory the Great as expounded to Mellitus, the\r\nfloating customs have often settled upon conveniently neighbouring\r\ndates of wakes, rushbearings, kirmesses and other forms of vigil or\r\ndedication festivals[381]; and even, in the utter oblivion of their\r\nprimitive significance, upon the anniversaries of historical events,\r\nsuch as Royal Oak day on May 29[382], or Gunpowder day. Finally it\r\nmay be noted, that of the five feasts that of high summer is the one\r\nmost fully preserved in modern survivals. This is partly because it\r\ncomes at a convenient time of year for the out-of-door holiday-making\r\nwhich serves as a preservative for the traditional rites; partly also\r\nbecause, while the pastoral element in the feasts of the beginnings of\r\nwinter and summer soon became comparatively unimportant through the\r\nsubordination of pasturage to tillage, and the ploughing and harvest\r\nfeasts tended more and more to become affairs of the individual farm\r\ncarried out in close connexion with those operations themselves, the\r\nsummer feast retained its communal character and continued to be\r\ncelebrated by the whole village for the benefit of everybody’s crops\r\nand trees, and everybody’s flocks and herds[383]. It is therefore\r\nmainly, although not wholly, upon the summer feast that the analysis of\r\nthe agricultural ritual to be given in the next chapter will be based.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                           VILLAGE FESTIVALS\r\n\r\n    [_Bibliographical Note._--A systematic calendar of English\r\n    festival usages by a competent folk-lorist is much needed. J.\r\n    Brand, _Observations on Popular Antiquities_ (1777), based on\r\n    H. Bourne, _Antiquitates Vulgares_ (1725), and edited, first\r\n    by Sir Henry Ellis in 1813, 1841-2 and 1849, and then by W.\r\n    C. Hazlitt in 1870, is full of valuable material, but belongs\r\n    to the age of pre-scientific antiquarianism. R. T. Hampson,\r\n    _Medii Aevi Kalendarium_ (1841), is no less unsatisfactory. In\r\n    default of anything better, T. F. T. Dyer, _British Popular\r\n    Customs_ (1891), is a useful compilation from printed sources,\r\n    and P. H. Ditchfield, _Old English Customs_ (1896), a gossipy\r\n    account of contemporary survivals. These may be supplemented\r\n    from collections of more limited range, such as H. J. Feasey,\r\n    _Ancient English Holy Week Ceremonial_ (1897), and J. E. Vaux,\r\n    _Church Folk-Lore_ (1894); by treatises on local folk-lore, of\r\n    which W. Henderson, _Notes on the Folk-Lore of the Northern\r\n    Counties of England and the Borders_ (2nd ed. 1879), C. S. Burne\r\n    and G. F. Jackson, _Shropshire Folk-Lore_ (1883-5), and J. Rhys,\r\n    _Celtic Folk-Lore, Welsh and Manx_ (1901), are the best; and by\r\n    the various publications of the Folk-Lore Society, especially\r\n    the series of _County Folk-Lore_ (1895-9) and the successive\r\n    periodicals, _The Folk-Lore Record_ (1878-82), _Folk-Lore\r\n    Journal_ (1883-9), and _Folk-Lore_ (1890-1903). Popular accounts\r\n    of French _fêtes_ are given by E. Cortet, _Essai sur les Fêtes\r\n    religieuses_ (1867), and O. Havard, _Les Fêtes de nos Pères_\r\n    (1898). L. J. B. Bérenger-Féraud, _Superstitions et Survivances_\r\n    (1896), is more pretentious, but not really scholarly. C. Leber,\r\n    _Dissertations relatives à l’Histoire de France_ (1826-38), vol.\r\n    ix, contains interesting material of an historical character,\r\n    largely drawn from papers in the eighteenth-century periodical\r\n    _Le Mercure de France_. Amongst German books, J. Grimm,\r\n    _Teutonic Mythology_ (transl. J. S. Stallybrass, 1880-8), H.\r\n    Pfannenschmidt, _Germanische Erntefeste_ (1878), and U. Jahn,\r\n    _Die deutschen Opfergebräuche bei Ackerbau und Viehzucht_\r\n    (1884), are all excellent. Many of the books mentioned in the\r\n    bibliographical note to the last chapter remain useful for the\r\n    present and following ones; in particular J. G. Frazer, _The\r\n    Golden Bough_ (2nd ed. 1900), is, of course, invaluable. I have\r\n    only included in the above list such works of general range as I\r\n    have actually made most use of. Many others dealing with special\r\n    points are cited in the notes. A fuller guide to folk-lore\r\n    literature will be found in M. R. Cox, _Introduction to Folklore_\r\n    (2nd ed. 1897).]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe central fact of the agricultural festivals is the presence in the\r\nvillage of the fertilization spirit in the visible and tangible form\r\nof flowers and green foliage or of the fruits of the earth. Thus,\r\nwhen the peasants do their ‘observaunce to a morn of May,’ great\r\nboughs of hawthorn are cut before daybreak in the woods, and carried,\r\nwith other seasonable leafage and blossom, into the village street.\r\nLads plant branches before the doors of their mistresses. The folk\r\ndeck themselves, their houses, and the church in green. Some of them\r\nare clad almost entirely in wreaths and tutties, and become walking\r\nbushes, ‘Jacks i’ the green.’ The revel centres in dance and song\r\naround a young tree set up in some open space of the village, or a\r\nmore permanent May-pole adorned for the occasion with fresh garlands.\r\nA large garland, often with an anthropomorphic representation of the\r\nfertilization spirit in the form of a doll, parades the streets, and is\r\naccompanied by a ‘king’ or ‘queen,’ or a ‘king’ and ‘queen’ together.\r\nSuch a garland finds its place at all the seasonal feasts; but whereas\r\nin spring and summer it is naturally made of the new vegetation, at\r\nharvest it as naturally takes the form of a sheaf, often the last sheaf\r\ncut, of the corn. Then it is known as the ‘harvest-May’ or the ‘neck,’\r\nor if it is anthropomorphic in character, as the ‘kern-baby.’ Summer\r\nand harvest garlands alike are not destroyed when the festival is over,\r\nbut remain hung up on the May-pole or the church or the barn-door\r\nuntil the season for their annual renewing comes round. And sometimes\r\nthe grain of the ‘harvest-May’ is mingled in the spring with the\r\nseed-corn[384].\r\n\r\nThe rationale of such customs is fairly simple. They depend upon a\r\nnotion of sympathetic magic carried on into the animistic stage of\r\nbelief. Their object is to secure the beneficent influence of the\r\nfertilization spirit by bringing the persons or places to be benefited\r\ninto direct contact with the physical embodiment of that spirit. In the\r\nburgeoning quick set up on the village green is the divine presence.\r\nThe worshipper clad in leaves and flowers has made himself a garment of\r\nthe god, and is therefore in a very special sense under his protection.\r\nThus efficacy in folk-belief of physical contact may be illustrated by\r\nanother set of practices in which recourse is had to the fertilization\r\nspirit for the cure of disease. A child suffering from croup,\r\nconvulsions, rickets, or other ailment, is passed through a hole in\r\na split tree, or beneath a bramble rooted at both ends, or a strip of\r\nturf partly raised from the ground. It is the actual touch of earth or\r\nstem that works the healing[385].\r\n\r\nMay-pole or church may represent a focus of the cult at some specially\r\nsacred tree or grove in the heathen village. But the ceremony, though\r\nit centres at these, is not confined to them, for its whole purpose\r\nis to distribute the benign influence over the entire community,\r\nevery field, fold, pasture, orchard close and homestead thereof. At\r\nploughing, the driving of the first furrow; at harvest, the homecoming\r\nof the last wain, is attended with ritual. Probably all the primitive\r\nfestivals, and certainly that of high summer, included a lustration,\r\nin which the image or tree which stood for the fertilization spirit\r\nwas borne in solemn procession from dwelling to dwelling and round\r\nall the boundaries of the village. Tacitus records the progress of\r\nthe earth-goddess Nerthus amongst the German tribes about the mouth\r\nof the Elbe, and the dipping of the goddess and the drowning of her\r\nslaves in a lake at the term of the ceremony[386]. So too at Upsala in\r\nSweden the statue of Freyr went round when winter was at an end[387];\r\nwhile Sozomenes tells how, when Ulfilas was preaching Christianity\r\nto the Visigoths, Athanaric sent the image of his god abroad in\r\na wagon, and burnt the houses of all who refused to bow down and\r\nsacrifice[388]. Such lustrations continue to be a prominent feature\r\nof the folk survivals. They are preserved in a number of processional\r\ncustoms in all parts of England; in the municipal ‘ridings,’ ‘shows,’\r\nor ‘watches’ on St. George’s[389] or Midsummer[390] days; in the\r\n‘Godiva’ procession at Coventry[391], the ‘Bezant’ procession at\r\nShaftesbury[392]. Hardly a rural merry-making or wake, indeed, is\r\nwithout its procession; if it is only in the simple form of the _quête_\r\nwhich the children consider themselves entitled to make, with their\r\nMay-garland, or on some other traditional pretext, at various seasons\r\nof the calendar. Obviously in becoming mere _quêtes_, collections of\r\neggs, cakes and so forth, or even of small coins, as well as in falling\r\nentirely into the hands of the children, the processions have to some\r\nextent lost their original character. But the notion that the visit is\r\nto bring good fortune, or the ‘May’ or the ‘summer’ to the household,\r\nis not wholly forgotten in the rhymes used[393]. An interesting\r\nversion of the ceremony is the ‘furry’ or ‘faddy’ dance formerly used\r\nat Helston wake; for in this the oak-decked dancers claimed the right\r\nto pass in at one door and out at another through every house in the\r\nvillage[394].\r\n\r\nRoom has been found for the summer lustrations in the scheme of the\r\nChurch. In Catholic countries the statue of the local saint is commonly\r\ncarried round the village, either annually on his feast-day or in times\r\nof exceptional trouble[395]. The inter-relations of ecclesiastical\r\nand folk-ritual in this respect are singularly illustrated by the\r\ncelebration of St. Ubaldo’s eve (May 15) at Gubbio in Umbria. The folk\r\nprocession of the _Ceri_ is a very complete variety of the summer\r\nfestival. After vespers the clergy also hold a procession in honour of\r\nthe saint. At a certain point the two companies meet. An interchange\r\nof courtesies takes place. The priest elevates the host; the bearers\r\nof the _Ceri_ bow them to the ground; and each procession passes on\r\nits way[396]. In England the summer lustrations take an ecclesiastical\r\nform in the Rogations or ‘bannering’ of ‘Gang-week,’ a ceremony\r\nwhich itself appears to be based on very similar folk-customs of\r\nsouthern Europe[397]. Since the Reformation the Rogations have come\r\nto be regarded as little more than a ‘beating of the bounds.’ But the\r\ndeclared intention of them was originally to call for a blessing upon\r\nthe fruits of the earth; and it is not difficult to trace folk-elements\r\nin the ‘gospel oaks’ and ‘gospel wells’ at which station was made and\r\nthe gospel read, in the peeled willow wands borne by the boys who\r\naccompany the procession, in the whipping or ‘bumping’ of the said boys\r\nat the stations, and in the choice of ‘Gang-week’ for such agricultural\r\nrites as ‘youling’ and ‘well-dressing[398].’\r\n\r\nSome anthropomorphic representation of the fertilization spirit is a\r\ncommon, though not an invariable element in the lustration. A doll is\r\nset on the garland, or some popular ‘giant’ or other image is carried\r\nround[399]. Nor is it surprising that at the early spring festival\r\nwhich survives in Plough Monday, the plough itself, the central\r\ninstrument of the opening labour, figures. A variant of this custom may\r\nbe traced in certain maritime districts, where the functions of the\r\nagricultural deities have been extended to include the oversight of\r\nseafaring. Here it is not a plough but a boat or ship that makes its\r\nrounds, when the fishing season is about to begin. Ship processions are\r\nto be found in various parts of Germany[400]; at Minehead, Plymouth,\r\nand Devonport in the west of England, and probably also at Hull in the\r\nnorth[401].\r\n\r\nThe magical notions which, in part at least, explain the garland\r\ncustoms of the agricultural festival, are still more strongly at\r\nwork in some of its subsidiary rites. These declare themselves, when\r\nunderstood, to be of an essentially practical character, charms\r\ndesigned to influence the weather, and to secure the proper alternation\r\nof moisture and warmth which is needed alike for the growth and\r\nripening of the crops and for the welfare of the cattle. They are\r\nprobably even older than the garland-customs, for they do not imply\r\nthe animistic conception of a fertilization spirit immanent in leaf\r\nand blossom; and they depend not only upon the ‘sympathetic’ principle\r\nof influence by direct contact already illustrated, but also upon that\r\nother principle of similarity distinguished by Dr. Frazer as the basis\r\nof what he calls ‘mimetic’ magic. To the primitive mind the obvious\r\nway of obtaining a result in nature is to make an imitation of it\r\non a small scale. To achieve rain, water must be splashed about, or\r\nsome other characteristic of a storm or shower must be reproduced. To\r\nachieve sunshine, a fire must be lit, or some other representation of\r\nthe appearance and motion of the sun must be devised. Both rain-charms\r\nand sun-charms are very clearly recognizable in the village ritual.\r\n\r\nAs rain-charms, conscious or unconscious, must be classified the many\r\nfestival customs in which bathing or sprinkling holds an important\r\nplace. The image or bough which represents the fertilization spirit\r\nis solemnly dipped in or drenched with water. Here is the explanation\r\nof the ceremonial bathing of the goddess Nerthus recorded by Tacitus.\r\nIt has its parallels in the dipping of the images of saints in the\r\nfeast-day processions of many Catholic villages, and in the buckets\r\nof water sometimes thrown over May-pole or harvest-May. Nor is the\r\ndipping or drenching confined to the fertilization spirit. In order\r\nthat the beneficent influences of the rite may be spread widely abroad,\r\nwater is thrown on the fields and on the plough, while the worshippers\r\nthemselves, or a representative chosen from among them, are sprinkled\r\nor immersed. To this practice many survivals bear evidence; the virtues\r\npersistently ascribed to dew gathered on May morning, the ceremonial\r\nbathing of women annually or in times of drought with the expressed\r\npurpose of bringing fruitfulness on man or beast or crop, the ‘ducking’\r\ncustoms which play no inconsiderable part in the traditions of many a\r\nrural merry-making. Naturally enough, the original sense of the rite\r\nhas been generally perverted. The ‘ducking’ has become either mere\r\nhorse-play or else a rough-and-ready form of punishment for offences,\r\nreal or imaginary, against the rustic code of conduct. The churl who\r\nwill not stop working or will not wear green on the feast-day must\r\nbe ‘ducked,’ and under the form of the ‘cucking-stool,’ the ceremony\r\nhas almost worked its way into formal jurisprudence as an appropriate\r\ntreatment for feminine offenders. So, too, it has been with the\r\n‘ducking’ of the divinity. When the modern French peasant throws the\r\nimage of his saint into the water, he believes himself to be doing it,\r\nnot as a mimetic rain-charm, but as a punishment to compel a power\r\nobdurate to prayer to grant through fear the required boon.\r\n\r\nThe rain-charms took place, doubtless, at such wells, springs, or\r\nbrooks as the lustral procession passed in its progress round the\r\nvillage. It is also possible that there may have been, sometimes or\r\nalways, a well within the sacred grove itself and hard by the sacred\r\ntree. The sanctity derived by such wells and streams from the use of\r\nthem in the cult of the fertilization spirit is probably what is really\r\nintended by the water-worship so often ascribed to the heathen of\r\nwestern Europe, and coupled closely with tree-worship in the Christian\r\ndiscipline-books. The goddess of the tree was also the goddess of the\r\nwell. At the conversion her wells were taken over by the new religion.\r\nThey became holy wells, under the protection of the Virgin or one of\r\nthe saints. And they continued to be approached with the same rites as\r\nof old, for the purpose of obtaining the ancient boons for which the\r\nfertilization spirit had always been invoked. It will not be forgotten\r\nthat, besides the public cult of the fertilization spirit for the\r\nwelfare of the crops and herds, there was also a private cult, which\r\naimed at such more personal objects of desire as health, success in\r\nlove and marriage, and divination of the future. It is this private\r\ncult that is most markedly preserved in modern holy well customs.\r\nThese may be briefly summarized as follows[402]. The wells are sought\r\nfor procuring a husband or children, for healing diseases, especially\r\neye-ailments or warts, and for omens, these too most often in relation\r\nto wedlock. The worshipper bathes wholly or in part, or drinks the\r\nwater. Silence is often enjoined, or a motion _deasil_, that is, with\r\nthe sun’s course, round the well. Occasionally cakes are eaten, or\r\nsugar and water drunk, or the well-water is splashed on a stone. Very\r\ncommonly rags or bits of wool or hair are laid under a pebble or hung\r\non a bush near the well, or pins, more rarely coins or even articles of\r\nfood, are thrown into it. The objects so left are not probably to be\r\nregarded as offerings; the intention is rather to bring the worshipper,\r\nthrough the medium of his hair or clothes, or some object belonging to\r\nhim, into direct contact with the divinity. The close connexion between\r\ntree-and well-cult is shown by the use of the neighbouring bush on\r\nwhich to hang the rags. And the practice of dropping pins into the\r\nwell is almost exactly paralleled by that of driving nails ‘for luck’\r\ninto a sacred tree or its later representative, a cross or saintly\r\nimage. The theory may be hazarded that originally the sacred well was\r\nnever found without the sacred tree beside it. This is by no means the\r\ncase now; but it must be remembered that a tree is much more perishable\r\nthan a well. The tree once gone, its part in the ceremony would drop\r\nout, or be transferred to the well. But the original rite would include\r\nthem both. The visitant, for instance, would dip in the well, and then\r\ncreep under or through the tree, a double ritual which seems to survive\r\nin the most curious of all the dramatic games of children, ‘Draw a Pail\r\nof Water[403].’\r\n\r\nThe private cult of the fertilization spirit is not, of course, tied\r\nto fixed seasons. Its occasion is determined by the needs of the\r\nworshipper. But it is noteworthy that the efficacy of some holy wells\r\nis greatest on particular days, such as Easter or the first three\r\nSundays in May. And in many places the wells, whether ordinarily\r\nheld ‘holy’ or not, take an important place in the ceremonies of the\r\nvillage festival. The ‘gospel wells’ of the Rogation processions, and\r\nthe well to which the ‘Bezant’ procession goes at Shaftesbury are\r\ncases in point; while in Derbyshire the ‘well-dressings’ correspond\r\nto the ‘wakes,’ ‘rushbearings,’ and ‘Mayings’ of other districts.\r\nPalm Sunday and Easter Sunday, as well as the Rogation days, are in a\r\nmeasure Christian versions of the heathen agricultural feasts, and it\r\nis not, therefore, surprising to find an extensive use of holy water\r\nin ecclesiastical ritual, and a special rite of _Benedictio Fontium_\r\nincluded amongst the Easter ceremonies[404]. But the Christian custom\r\nhas been moralized, and its avowed aim is purification rather than\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary form of heat-charm was to build, in semblance of the sun,\r\nthe source of heat, a great fire[405]. Just as in the rain-charm the\r\nworshippers must be literally sprinkled with water, so, in order that\r\nthey may receive the full benefits of the heat-charm, they must come\r\ninto direct physical contact with the fire, by standing in the smoke,\r\nor even leaping through the flames, or by smearing their faces with the\r\ncharred ashes[406]. The cattle too must be driven through the fire, in\r\norder that they may be fertile and free from pestilence throughout the\r\nsummer; and a whole series of observances had for their especial object\r\nthe distribution of the preserving influence over the farms. The fires\r\nwere built on high ground, that they might be visible far and wide. Or\r\nthey were built in a circle round the fields, or to windward, so that\r\nthe smoke might blow across the corn. Blazing arrows were shot in the\r\nair, or blazing torches carried about. Ashes were sprinkled over the\r\nfields, or mingled with the seed corn or the fodder in the stall[407].\r\nCharred brands were buried or stuck upright in the furrows. Further, by\r\na simple symbolism, the shape and motion of the sun were mimicked with\r\ncircular rotating bodies. A fiery barrel or a fiery wheel was rolled\r\ndown the hill on the top of which the ceremony took place. The lighted\r\ntorches were whirled in the air, or replaced by lighted disks of wood,\r\nflung on high. All these customs still linger in these islands or in\r\nother parts of western Europe, and often the popular imagination finds\r\nin their successful performance an omen for the fertility of the year.\r\n\r\nOn _a priori_ grounds one might have expected two agricultural\r\nfestivals during the summer; one in the earlier part of it, when\r\nmoisture was all-important, accompanied with rain-charms; the other\r\nlater on, when the crops were well grown and heat was required to\r\nripen them, accompanied with sun-charms. But the evidence is rather in\r\nfavour of a single original festival determined, in the dislocation\r\ncaused by a calendar, to different dates in different localities[408].\r\nThe Midsummer or St. John’s fires are perhaps the most widely spread\r\nand best known of surviving heat-charms. But they can be paralleled\r\nby others distributed all over the summer cycle of festivals, at\r\nEaster[409] and on May-day, and in connexion with the ploughing\r\ncelebrations on Epiphany, Candlemas, Shrovetide, Quadragesima, and\r\nSt. Blaize’s day. It is indeed at Easter and Candlemas that the\r\n_Benedictiones_, which are the ecclesiastical versions of the ceremony,\r\nappear in the ritual-books[410]. On the other hand, although, perhaps\r\nowing to the later notion of the solstice, the fires are greatly\r\nprominent on St. John’s day, and are explained with considerable\r\ningenuity by the monkish writers[411], yet this day was never a\r\nfire-festival and nothing else. Garland customs are common upon it, and\r\nthere is even evidence, though slight evidence, for rain-charms[412].\r\nIt is perhaps justifiable to infer that the crystallization of the\r\nrain-and heat-charms, which doubtless were originally used only when\r\nthe actual condition of the weather made them necessary, into annual\r\nfestivals, took place after the exact rationale of them had been\r\nlost, and they had both come to be looked upon, rather vaguely, as\r\nweather-charms.\r\n\r\nApart from the festival-fires, a superstitious use of sun-charms\r\nendured in England to an extraordinarily late date. This was in times\r\nof drought and pestilence as a magical remedy against mortality amongst\r\nthe cattle. A fire was built, and, as on the festivals, the cattle were\r\nmade to pass through the smoke and flames[413]. On such occasions, and\r\noften at the festival-fires themselves, it was held requisite that,\r\njust as the water used in the rain-charms would be fresh water from\r\nthe spring, so the fire must be fresh fire. That is to say, it must\r\nnot be lit from any pre-existing fire, but must be made anew. And, so\r\nconservative is cult, this must be done, not with the modern device\r\nof matches, or even with flint and steel, but by the primitive method\r\nof causing friction in dry work. Such fire is known as ‘need-fire’ or\r\n‘forced fire,’ and is produced in various ways, by rubbing two pieces\r\nof wood together, by turning a drill in a solid block, or by rapidly\r\nrotating a wheel upon an axle. Often certain precautions are observed,\r\nas that nine men must work at the job, or chaste boys; and often all\r\nthe hearth-fires in the village are first extinguished, to be rekindled\r\nby the new flame[414].\r\n\r\nThe custom of rolling a burning wheel downhill from the festival-fire\r\namongst the vineyards has been noted. The wheel is, of course, by\r\nno means an uncommon solar emblem[415]. Sometimes round bannocks or\r\nhard-boiled eggs are similarly rolled downhill. The use of both of\r\nthese may be sacrificial in its nature. But the egg plays such a large\r\npart in festival customs, especially at Easter, when it is reddened,\r\nor gilt, or coloured yellow with furze or broom flowers, and popularly\r\nregarded as a symbol of the Resurrection, that one is tempted to ask\r\nwhether it does not stand for the sun itself[416]. And are we to find\r\nthe sun in the ‘parish top[417],’ or in the ball with which, even in\r\ncathedrals, ceremonial games were played[418]? If so, perhaps this\r\ngame of ball may be connected with the curious belief that if you get\r\nup early enough on Easter morning you may see the sun dance[419].\r\n\r\nIn any case sun-charms, quite independent of the fires, may probably\r\nbe traced in the circular movements which so often appear invested\r\nwith a religious significance, and which sometimes form part of the\r\nfestivals[420]. It would be rash to regard such movements as the basis\r\nof every circular dance or _ronde_ on such an occasion; a ring is too\r\nobviously the form which a crowd of spectators round any object, sacred\r\nor otherwise, must take. But there are many circumambulatory rites in\r\nwhich stress is laid on the necessity for the motion to be _deasil_,\r\nor with the right hand to the centre, in accordance with the course\r\nof the sun, and not in the opposite direction, _cartuaitheail_ or\r\n_withershins_[421]. And these, perhaps, may be legitimately considered\r\nas of magical origin.\r\n\r\nWith the growth of animistic or spiritual religion, the mental\r\ntendencies, out of which magical practices or charms arise, gradually\r\ncease to be operative in the consciousness of the worshippers. The\r\ncharms themselves, however, are preserved by the conservative instinct\r\nof cult. In part they survive as mere bits of traditional ritual, for\r\nwhich no particular reason is given or demanded; in part also they\r\nbecome material for that other instinct, itself no less inveterate\r\nin the human mind, by which the relics of the past are constantly in\r\nprocess of being re-explained and brought into new relations with\r\nthe present. The sprinkling with holy water, for instance, which was\r\noriginally of the nature of a rain-charm, comes to be regarded as a\r\nrite symbolical of spiritual purification and regeneration. An even\r\nmore striking example of such transformation of intention is to be\r\nfound in the practice, hardly yet referred to in this account of the\r\nagricultural festivals, of sacrifice. In the ordinary acceptation\r\nof the term, sacrifice implies not merely an animistic, but an\r\nanthropomorphic conception of the object of cult. The offering or\r\noblation with which man approaches his god is an extension of the\r\ngift with which, as suppliant, he approaches his fellow men. But the\r\noblational aspect of sacrifice is not the only one. In his remarkable\r\nbook upon _The Religion of the Semites_, Professor Robertson Smith has\r\nformulated another, which may be distinguished as ‘sacramental.’ In\r\nthis the sacrifice is regarded as the renewal of a special tie between\r\nthe god and his worshippers, analogous to the blood-bond which exists\r\namongst those worshippers themselves. The victim is not an offering\r\nmade to the god; on the contrary, the god himself is, or is present\r\nin, the victim. It is his blood which is shed, and by means of the\r\nsacrificial banquet and its subsidiary rites, his personality becomes,\r\nas it were, incorporated in those of his clansmen[422]. It is not\r\nnecessary to determine here the general priority of the two types or\r\nconceptions of sacrifice described. But, while it is probable that the\r\nKelts and Teutons of the time of the conversion consciously looked upon\r\nsacrifice as an oblation, there is also reason to believe that, at an\r\nearlier period, the notion of a sacrament had been the predominant\r\none. For the sacrificial ritual of these peoples, and especially that\r\nused in the agricultural cult, so far as it can be traced, is only\r\nexplicable as an elaborate process of just that physical incorporation\r\nof the deity in the worshippers and their belongings, which it was\r\nthe precise object of the sacramental sacrifice to bring about. It\r\nwill be clear that sacrifice, so regarded, enters precisely into that\r\ncategory of ideas which has been defined as magical. It is but one more\r\nexample of that belief in the efficacy of direct contact which lies at\r\nthe root of sympathetic magic. As in the case of the garland customs,\r\nthis belief, originally pre-animistic, has endured into an animistic\r\nstage of thought. Through the garland and the posies the worshipper\r\nsought contact with the fertilization spirit in its phytomorphic form;\r\nthrough sacrifice he approaches it in its theriomorphic form also.\r\nThe earliest sacrificial animals, then, were themselves regarded as\r\ndivine, and were naturally enough the food animals of the folk. The use\r\nmade by the Kelto-Teutonic peoples of oxen, sheep, goats, swine, deer,\r\ngeese, and fowls requires no explanation. A common victim was also\r\nthe horse, which the Germans seem, up to a late date, to have kept in\r\ndroves and used for food. The strong opposition of the Church to the\r\nsacrificial use of horse-flesh may possibly account for the prejudice\r\nagainst it as a food-stuff in modern Europe[423]. A similar prejudice,\r\nhowever, in the case of the hare, an animal of great importance in folk\r\nbelief, already existed in the time of Caesar[424]. It is a little more\r\npuzzling to find distinct traces of sacrificial customs in connexion\r\nwith animals, such as the dog, cat, wolf, fox, squirrel, owl, wren,\r\nand so forth, which are not now food animals[425]. But they may once\r\nhave been such, or the explanation may lie in an extension of the\r\nsacrificial practice after the first rationale of it was lost.\r\n\r\nAt every agricultural festival, then, animal sacrifice may be assumed\r\nas an element. The analogy of the relation between the fertilization\r\nspirit and his worshippers to the human blood bond makes it probable\r\nthat originally the rite was always a bloody one[426]. Some of\r\nthe blood was poured on the sacred tree. Some was sprinkled upon\r\nthe worshippers, or smeared over their faces, or solemnly drunk\r\nby them[427]. Hides, horns, and entrails were also hung upon the\r\ntree[428], or worn as festival trappings[429]. The flesh was, of\r\ncourse, solemnly eaten in the sacrificial meal[430]. The crops, as\r\nwell as their cultivators, must benefit by the rites; and therefore\r\nthe fields, and doubtless also the cattle, had their sprinkling of\r\nblood, while heads or pieces of flesh were buried in the furrows, or at\r\nthe threshold of the byre[431]. A fair notion of the whole proceeding\r\nmay be obtained from the account of the similar Indian worship of the\r\nearth-goddess given in Appendix I. The intention of the ceremonies will\r\nbe obvious by a comparison with those already explained. The wearing\r\nof the skins of the victims is precisely parallel to the wearing of\r\nthe green vegetation, the sprinkling with blood to the sprinkling\r\nwith lustral water, the burial in the fields of flesh and skulls to\r\nthe burial of brands from the festival-fire. In each case the belief\r\nin the necessity of direct physical contact to convey the beneficent\r\ninfluence is at the bottom of the practice. It need hardly be said\r\nthat of such physical contact the most complete example is in the\r\nsacramental banquet itself.\r\n\r\nIt is entirely consistent with the view here taken of the primitive\r\nnature of sacrifice, that the fertilization spirit was sacrificed at\r\nthe village festivals in its vegetable as well as in its animal form.\r\nThere were bread-offerings as well as meat-offerings[432]. Sacramental\r\ncakes were prepared with curious rituals which attest their primitive\r\ncharacter. Like the _tcharnican_ or Beltane cakes, they were kneaded\r\nand moulded by hand and not upon a board[433]; like the loaf in the\r\nAnglo-Saxon charm, they were compounded of all sorts of grain in order\r\nthat they might be representative of every crop in the field[434].\r\nAt the harvest they would naturally be made, wholly or in part, of\r\nthe last sheaf cut. The use of them corresponded closely to that made\r\nof the flesh of the sacrificial victim. Some were laid on a branch\r\nof the sacred tree[435]; others flung into the sacred well or the\r\nfestival-fire; others again buried in the furrows, or crumbled up and\r\nmingled with the seed-corn[436]. And like the flesh they were solemnly\r\neaten by the worshippers themselves at the sacrificial banquet. With\r\nthe sacrificial cake went the sacrificial draught, also made out of the\r\nfruits of the earth, in the southern lands wine, but in the vineless\r\nnorth ale, or cider, or that mead which Pytheas described the Britons\r\nas brewing out of honey and wheat[437]. Of this, too, the trees and\r\ncrops received their share, while it filled the cup for those toasts\r\nor _minnes_ to the dead and to Odin and Freyja their rulers, which\r\nwere afterwards transferred by Christian Germany to St. John and St.\r\nGertrude[438].\r\n\r\nThe animal and the cereal sacrifices seem plausible enough, but they do\r\nnot exhaust the problem. One has to face the fact that human sacrifice,\r\nas Victor Hehn puts it, ‘peers uncannily forth from the dark past of\r\nevery Aryan race[439]. So far as the Kelts and Teutons go, there is\r\nplenty of evidence to show, that up to the very moment of their contact\r\nwith Roman civilization, in some branches even up to the very moment\r\nof their conversion to Christianity, it was not yet obsolete[440].\r\nAn explanation of it is therefore required, which shall fall in with\r\nthe general theory of agricultural sacrifice. The subject is very\r\ndifficult, but, on the whole, it seems probable that originally the\r\nslaying of a human being at an annually recurring festival was not of\r\nthe nature of sacrifice at all. It is doubtful whether it was ever\r\nsacrifice in the sacramental sense, and although in time it came to be\r\nregarded as an oblation, this was not until the first meaning, both\r\nof the sacrifice and of the human death, had been lost. The essential\r\nfacts bearing on the question have been gathered together by Dr. Frazer\r\nin _The Golden Bough_. He brings out the point that the victim in a\r\nhuman sacrifice was not originally merely a man, but a very important\r\nman, none other than the king, the priest-king of the tribe. In many\r\ncommunities, Aryan-speaking and other, it has been the principal\r\nfunction of such a priest-king to die, annually or at longer intervals,\r\nfor the people. His place is taken, as a rule, by the tribesman who has\r\nslain him[441]. Dr. Frazer’s own explanation of this custom is, that\r\nthe head of the tribe was looked upon as possessed of great magical\r\npowers, as a big medicine man, and was in fact identified with the god\r\nhimself. And his periodical death, says Dr. Frazer, was necessary,\r\nin order to renew the vitality of the god, who might decay and cease\r\nto exist, were he not from time to time reincarnated by being slain\r\nand passing into the body of his slayer and successor[442]. This is a\r\nhighly ingenious and fascinating theory, but unfortunately there are\r\nseveral difficulties in the way of accepting it. In the first place\r\nit is inconsistent with the explanation of the sacramental killing of\r\nthe god arrived at by Professor Robertson Smith. According to this\r\nthe sacrifice of the god is for the sake of his worshippers, that the\r\nblood-bond with them may be renewed; and we have seen that this view\r\nfits in admirably with the minor sacrificial rites, such as the eating\r\nand burying of the flesh, as the wearing of the horns and hides. Dr.\r\nFrazer, however, obliges us to hold that the god is also sacrificed\r\nfor his own sake, and leaves us in the position of propounding two\r\nquite distinct and independent reasons for the same fact. Secondly,\r\nthere is no evidence, at least amongst Aryan-speaking peoples, for that\r\nbreaking down of the very real and obvious distinction between the god\r\nand his chief worshipper or priest, which Dr. Frazer’s theory implies.\r\nAnd thirdly, if the human victim were slain as being the god, surely\r\nthis slaughter should have replaced the slaughter of the animal victim\r\npreviously slain for the same reason, which it did not, and should have\r\nbeen followed by a sacramental meal of a cannibal type, of which also,\r\nin western Europe, there is but the slightest trace[443].\r\n\r\nProbably, therefore, the alternative explanation of Dr. Frazer’s own\r\nfacts given by Dr. Jevons is preferable. According to this the death\r\nof the human victim arises out of the circumstances of the animal\r\nsacrifice. The slaying of the divine animal is an act approached by the\r\ntribe with mingled feelings. It is necessary, in order to renew the\r\nall-essential blood-bond between the god and his worshippers. And at\r\nthe same time it is an act of sacrilege; it is killing the god. There\r\nis some hesitation amongst the assembled worshippers. Who will dare the\r\ndeed and face its consequences? ‘The clansman,’ says Dr. Jevons, ‘whose\r\nreligious conviction of the clan’s need of communion with the god was\r\ndeepest, would eventually and after long waiting be the one to strike,\r\nand take upon himself the issue, for the sake of his fellow men.’ This\r\nissue would be twofold. The slayer would be exalted in the eyes of\r\nhis fellows. He would naturally be the first to drink the shed blood\r\nof the god. A double portion of the divine spirit would enter into\r\nhim. He would become, for a while, the leader, the priest-king, of the\r\ncommunity. At the same time he would incur blood-guiltiness. And in a\r\nyear’s time, when his sanctity was exhausted, the penalty would have to\r\nbe paid. His death would accompany the renewal of the bond by a fresh\r\nsacrifice, implying in its turn the self-devotion of a fresh annual\r\nking[444].\r\n\r\nThese theories belong to a region of somewhat shadowy conjecture. If\r\nDr. Jevons is right, it would seem to follow that, as has already been\r\nsuggested, the human death at an annual festival was not initially\r\nsacrifice. It accompanied, but did not replace the sacramental\r\nslaughter of a divine animal. But when the animal sacrifice had itself\r\nchanged its character, and was looked upon, no longer as an act of\r\ncommunion with the god, but as an offering or bribe made to him,\r\nthen a new conception of the human death also was required. When the\r\nanimal ceased to be recognized as the god, the need of a punishment\r\nfor slaying it disappeared. But the human death could not be left\r\nmeaningless, and its meaning was assimilated to that of the animal\r\nsacrifice itself. It also became an oblation, the greatest that could\r\nbe offered by the tribe to its protector and its judge. And no doubt\r\nthis was the conscious view taken of the matter by Kelts and Teutons at\r\nthe time when they appear in history. The human sacrifice was on the\r\nsame footing as the animal sacrifice, but it was a more binding, a more\r\npotent, a more solemn appeal.\r\n\r\nIn whatever way human sacrifice originated, it was obviously destined,\r\nwith the advance of civilization, to undergo modification. Not only\r\nwould the growing moral sense of mankind learn to hold it a dark and\r\nterrible thing, but also to go on killing the leading man of the tribe,\r\nthe king-priest, would have its obvious practical inconveniences. At\r\nfirst, indeed, these would not be great. The king-priest would be\r\nlittle more than a rain-maker, a _rex sacrorum_, and one man might\r\nperform the ceremonial observances as well as another. But as time went\r\non, and the tribe settled down to a comparatively civilized life, the\r\nserious functions of its leader would increase. He would become the\r\narbiter of justice, the adviser in debate; above all, when war grew\r\ninto importance, the captain in battle. And to spare and replace, year\r\nby year, the wisest councillor and the bravest warrior would grow into\r\nan intolerable burden. Under some such circumstances, one can hardly\r\ndoubt, a process of substitution set in. Somebody had to die for the\r\nking. At first, perhaps, the substitute was an inferior member of the\r\nking’s own house, or even an ordinary tribesman, chosen by lot. But\r\nthe process, once begun, was sure to continue, and presently it was\r\nsufficient if a life of little value, that of a prisoner, a slave,\r\na criminal, a stranger within the gates, was sacrificed[445]. The\r\ncommon belief in madness or imbecility as a sign of divine possession\r\nmay perhaps have contributed to make the village fool or natural\r\nseem a particularly suitable victim. But to the very end of Teutonic\r\nand Keltic heathenism, the sense that the substitute was, after all,\r\nonly a substitute can be traced. In times of great stress or danger,\r\nindeed, the king might still be called upon to suffer in person[446].\r\nAnd always a certain pretence that the victim was the king was kept\r\nup. Even though a slave or criminal, he was for a few days preceding\r\nthe sacrifice treated royally. He was a temporary king, was richly\r\ndressed and feasted, had a crown set on his head, and was permitted to\r\nhold revel with his fellows. The farce was played out in the sight of\r\nmen and gods[447]. Ultimately, of course, the natural growth of the\r\nsanctity of human life in a progressive people, or in an unprogressive\r\npeople the pressure of outside ideals[448], forbids the sacrifice of\r\na man at all. Perhaps the temporary king is still chosen, and even\r\nsome symbolic mimicked slaying of him takes place; but actually he does\r\nnot die. An animal takes his place upon the altar; or more strictly\r\nspeaking, an animal remains the last victim, as it had been the first,\r\nand in myth is regarded as a substitute for the human victim which for\r\na time had shared its fate. Of such a myth the legends of Abraham and\r\nIsaac and of Iphigeneia at Aulis are the classical examples.\r\n\r\nThere is another group of myths for which, although they lack this\r\nelement of a substituted victim, mythologists find an origin in\r\na reformation of religious sentiment leading to the abolition of\r\nhuman sacrifice. The classical legend of Perseus and Andromeda, the\r\nhagiological legend of St. George and the Dragon, the Teutonic legend\r\nof Beowulf and Grendel, are only types of innumerable tales in which\r\nthe hero puts an end to the periodical death of a victim by slaying\r\nthe monster who has enforced and profited by it[449]. What is such a\r\nstory but the imaginative statement of the fact that such sacrifices\r\nat one time were, and are not? It is, however, noticeable, that in the\r\nmajority of these stories, although not in all, the dragon or monster\r\nslain has his dwelling in water, and this leads to the consideration\r\nof yet another sophistication of the primitive notion of sacrifice.\r\nAccording to this notion sacrifice was necessarily bloody; in the\r\nshedding of blood and in the sacrament of blood partaken of by the\r\nworshippers, lay the whole gist of the rite: a bloodless sacrifice\r\nwould have no _raison d’être_. On the other hand, the myths just\r\nreferred to seem to imply a bloodless sacrifice by drowning, and this\r\nnotion is confirmed by an occasional bit of ritual, and by the common\r\nsuperstition which represents the spirits of certain lakes and rivers\r\nas claiming a periodical victim in the shape of a drowned person[450].\r\nSimilarly there are traces of sacrifices, which must have been equally\r\nbloodless, by fire. At the Beltane festival, for instance, one member\r\nof the party is chosen by lot to be the ‘victim,’ is made to jump\r\nover the flames and is spoken of in jest as ‘dead[451].’ Various\r\nRoman writers, who apparently draw from the second-century B.C. Greek\r\nexplorer Posidonius, ascribe to the Druids of Gaul a custom of burning\r\nhuman and other victims at quinquennial feasts in colossal images of\r\nhollow wickerwork; and squirrels, cats, snakes and other creatures are\r\nfrequently burnt in modern festival-fires[452]. The constant practice,\r\nindeed, of burning bones in such fires has given them the specific\r\nname of bonfires, and it may be taken for granted that the bones are\r\nonly representatives of more complete victims. I would suggest that\r\nsuch sacrifices by water and fire are really developments of the\r\nwater-and fire-charms described in the last chapter; and that just\r\nas the original notion of sacrifice has been extended to give a new\r\nsignificance to the death of a human being at a religious festival,\r\nwhen the real reason for that death had been forgotten, so it has been\r\nstill further extended to cover the primitive water-and fire-charms\r\nwhen they too had become meaningless. I mean that at a festival the\r\nvictims, like the image and the worshippers, were doubtless habitually\r\nflung into water or passed through fire as part of the charm; and that,\r\nat a time when sacrifice had grown into mere oblation and the shedding\r\nof blood was therefore no longer essential, these rites were adapted\r\nand given new life as alternative methods of effecting the sacrifice.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that there should be but few direct and evident\r\nsurvivals of sacrifice in English village custom. For at the time\r\nof the conversion the rite must have borne the whole brunt of the\r\nmissionary attack. The other elements of the festivals, the sacred\r\ngarlands, the water-and fire-charms, had already lost much of their\r\noriginal significance. A judgement predisposed to toleration might\r\nplausibly look upon them as custom rather than worship. It was\r\nnot so with sacrifice. This too had had its history, and in divers\r\nways changed its character. But it was still essentially a liturgy.\r\nOblation or sacrament, it could not possibly be dissociated from a\r\nrecognition of the divine nature of the power in whose honour it took\r\nplace. And therefore it must necessarily be renounced, as a condition\r\nof acceptance in the Church at all, by the most weak-kneed convert.\r\nWhat happened was precisely that to which Gregory the Great looked\r\nforward. The sacrificial banquet, the great chines of flesh, and the\r\nbeakers of ale, cider, and mead, endured, but the central rite of\r\nthe old festival, the ceremonial slaying of the animal, vanished.\r\nThe exceptions, however, are not so rare as might at first sight be\r\nthought, and naturally they are of singular interest. It has already\r\nbeen pointed out that in times of stress and trouble, the thinly\r\nveneered heathenism of the country folk long tended to break out, and\r\nin particular that up to a very late date the primitive need-fire was\r\noccasionally revived to meet the exigencies of a cattle-plague. Under\r\nprecisely similar circumstances, and sometimes in immediate connexion\r\nwith the need-fire, cattle have been known, even during the present\r\ncentury, to be sacrificed[453]. Nor are such sporadic instances the\r\nonly ones that can be adduced. Here and there sacrifice, in a more or\r\nless modified form, remains an incident in the village festival. The\r\nalleged custom of annually sacrificing a sheep on May-day at Andreas\r\nin the Isle of Man rests on slight evidence[454]; but there is a\r\nfairly well authenticated example in the ‘ram feast’ formerly held on\r\nthe same day in the village of Holne in Devonshire. A ram was slain\r\nat a granite pillar or ancient altar in the village ‘ploy-field,’\r\nand a struggle took place for slices which were supposed to bring\r\nluck[455]. Still more degenerate survivals are afforded by the\r\nWhitsun feast at King’s Teignton, also in Devonshire[456], and by the\r\nWhitsun ‘lamb feast’ at Kidlington[457], the Trinity ‘lamb ale’ at\r\nKirtlington[458], and the ‘Whit hunt’ in Wychwood Forest[459], all\r\nthree places lying close together in Oxfordshire. These five cases have\r\nbeen carefully recorded and studied; but they do not stand alone; for\r\nthe folk-calendar affords numerous examples of days which are marked,\r\neither universally or locally, by the ceremonial hunting or killing of\r\nsome wild or domestic animal, or by the consumption of a particular\r\ndish which readily betrays its sacrificial origin[460]. The appearance\r\nof animals in ecclesiastical processions in St. Paul’s cathedral[461]\r\nand at Bury St. Edmunds[462] is especially significant; and it is\r\nnatural to find an origin for the old English sport of bull-baiting\r\nrather in a survival of heathen ritual than in any reminiscence of the\r\nRoman amphitheatre[463]. Even where sacrifice itself has vanished,\r\nthe minor rites which once accompanied it are still perpetuated in\r\nthe superstitions or the festival customs of the peasantry. The heads\r\nand hides of horses or cattle, like the _exuviae_ of the sacrificial\r\nvictims, are worn or carried in dance, procession or _quête_[464].\r\nThe dead bodies of animals are suspended by shepherds or game-keepers\r\nupon tree and barn-door, from immemorial habit or from some vague\r\nsuspicion of the luck they will bring. Although inquiry will perhaps\r\nelicit the fallacious explanation that they are there _pour encourager\r\nles autres_[465]. In the following chapters an attempt will be made\r\nto show how widely sacrifice is represented in popular amusements\r\nand _ludi_. Here it will be sufficient to call attention to two\r\npersonages who figure largely in innumerable village festivals. One\r\nis the ‘hobby-horse,’ not yet, though Shakespeare will have it so,\r\n‘forgot[466]’: the other the ‘fool’ or ‘squire,’ a buffoon with a\r\npendent cow’s tail, who is in many places _de rigueur_ in Maying or\r\nrushbearing[467]. Both of these grotesques seem to be at bottom nothing\r\nbut worshippers careering in the skins of sacrificed animals.\r\n\r\nThe cereal or liquor sacrifice is of less importance. Sugar and\r\nwater, which may be conjectured to represent mead, is occasionally\r\ndrunk beside a sacred well, and in one instance, at least, bread and\r\ncheese are thrown into the depths. Sometimes also a ploughman carries\r\nbread and cheese in his pocket when he goes abroad to cut the first\r\nfurrow[468]. But the original rite is probably most nearly preserved in\r\nthe custom of ‘youling’ fruit-trees to secure a good crop. When this\r\nis done, at Christmas or Ascension-tide, ale or cider is poured on the\r\nroots of the trees, and a cake placed in a fork of the boughs. Here\r\nand there a cake is also hung on the horn of an ox in the stall[469].\r\nDoubtless the ‘feasten’ cake, of traditional shape and composition,\r\nwhich pervades the country, is in its origin sacramental[470]. Commonly\r\nenough, it represents an animal or human being, and in such cases it\r\nmay be held, while retaining its own character of a cereal sacrifice,\r\nto be also a substitute for the animal or human sacrifice with which it\r\nshould by rights be associated[471].\r\n\r\nAn unauthenticated and somewhat incredible story has been brought from\r\nItaly to the effect that the mountaineers of the Abruzzi are still\r\nin the habit of offering up a human sacrifice in Holy week[472]. In\r\nthese islands a reminiscence of the observance is preserved in the\r\n‘victim’ of the Beltane festival[473], and a transformation of it in\r\nthe whipping of lads when the bounds are beaten in the Rogations[474].\r\nSome others, less obvious, will be suggested in the sequel. In any case\r\none ceremony which, as has been seen, grew out of human sacrifice, has\r\nproved remarkably enduring. This is the election of the temporary king.\r\nOriginally chosen out of the lowest of the people for death, and fêted\r\nas the equivalent or double of the real king-priest of the community,\r\nhe has survived the tragic event which gave him birth, and plays a\r\ngreat part as the master of the ceremonies in many a village revel.\r\nThe English ‘May-king,’ or ‘summer-king,’ or ‘harvest-lord[475],’ or\r\n‘mock-mayor[476],’ is a very familiar personage, and can be even more\r\nabundantly paralleled from continental festivals[477]. To the May-king\r\nin particular we shall return. But in concluding this chapter it is\r\nworth while to point out and account for two variants of the custom\r\nunder consideration. In many cases, probably in the majority of cases\r\nso far as the English May-day is concerned, the king is not a king,\r\nbut a queen. Often, indeed, the part is played by a lad in woman’s\r\nclothes, but this seems only to emphasize the fact that the temporary\r\nruler is traditionally regarded as a female one[478]. It is probable\r\nthat we have here no modern development, but a primitive element\r\nin the agricultural worship. Tacitus records the presence amongst\r\nthe Germans of a male priest ‘adorned as women use[479],’ while the\r\nexchange of garments by the sexes is included amongst festival abuses\r\nin the ecclesiastical discipline-books[480]. Occasionally, moreover,\r\nthe agricultural festivals, like those of the _Bona Dea_ at Rome, are\r\nstrictly feminine functions, from which all men are excluded[481].\r\nNaturally I regard these facts as supporting my view of the origin of\r\nthe agricultural worship in a women’s cult, upon which the pastoral\r\ncult of the men was afterwards engrafted. And finally, there are cases\r\nin which not a king alone nor a queen alone is found, but a king and a\r\nqueen[482]. This also would be a reasonable outcome of the merging of\r\nthe two cults. Some districts know the May-queen as the May-bride, and\r\nit is possible that a symbolical wedding of a priest and priestess may\r\nhave been one of the regular rites of the summer festivals. For this\r\nthere seem to be some parallels in Greek and Roman custom, while the\r\nmyth which represents the heaven as the fertilizing husband of the\r\nfruitful earth is of hoar antiquity amongst the Aryan-speaking peoples.\r\nThe forces which make for the fertility of the fields were certainly\r\nidentified in worship with those which make for human fertility. The\r\nwaters of the sacred well or the blaze of the festival fire help the\r\ngrowth of the crops; they also help women in their desire for a lover\r\nand for motherhood. And it may be taken for granted that the summer\r\nfestivals knew from the beginning that element of sexual licence\r\nwhich fourteen centuries of Christianity have not wholly been able to\r\nbanish[483].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                             FESTIVAL PLAY\r\n\r\n    [_Bibliographical Note._--A systematic revision of J. Strutt,\r\n    _The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England_ (1801,\r\n    ed. W. Hone, 1830), is, as in the case of Brand’s book, much\r\n    needed. On the psychology of play should be consulted K. Groos,\r\n    _Die Spiele der Thiere_ (1896, transl. 1898), and _Die Spiele\r\n    der Menschen_ (1899, transl. 1901). Various anthropological\r\n    aspects of play are discussed by A. C. Haddon, _The Study of\r\n    Man_ (1898), and the elaborate dictionary of _The Traditional\r\n    Games of England, Scotland and Ireland_ by Mrs. A. B. Gomme\r\n    (1894-8) may be supplemented from W. W. Newell, _Games and Songs\r\n    of American Children_ (1884), H. C. Bolton, _The Counting-Out\r\n    Rhymes of Children_ (1888), E. W. B. Nicholson, _Golspie_ (1897),\r\n    and R. C. Maclagan, _The Games and Diversions of Argyleshire_\r\n    (F.L.S. 1901). The _charivari_ is treated by C. R. B. Barrett,\r\n    _Riding Skimmington and Riding the Stang_ in the _Journal of the\r\n    British Archaeological Association_, N. S. i. 58, and C. Noirot,\r\n    _L’Origine des Masques_ (1609), reprinted with illustrative\r\n    matter by C. Leber, _Dissertations relatives à l’Histoire de\r\n    France_, vol. ix. The account of the Coventry Hox Tuesday Play\r\n    given in _Robert Laneham’s Letter_ (1575) will be found in\r\n    Appendix H.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe charms, the prayer, the sacrifice, make up that side of the\r\nagricultural festival which may properly be regarded as cult: they do\r\nnot make up the whole of it. It is natural to ask whether, side by side\r\nwith the observances of a natural religion, there were any of a more\r\nspiritual type; whether the village gods of our Keltic and Teutonic\r\nancestors were approached on festival occasions solely as the givers of\r\nthe good things of earth, or whether there was also any recognition of\r\nthe higher character which in time they came to have as the guardians\r\nof morality, such as we can trace alike in the ritual of Eleusis and\r\nin the tribal mysteries of some existing savage peoples. It is not\r\nimprobable that this was so; but it may be doubted whether there is\r\nmuch available evidence on the matter, and, in any case, it cannot be\r\ngone into here[484]. There is, however, a third element of the village\r\nfestival which does demand consideration, and that is the element\r\nof play. The day of sacrifice was also a day of cessation from the\r\nordinary toil of the fields, a holiday as well as a holy day. Sacred\r\nand secular met in the amorous encounters smiled upon by the liberal\r\nwood-goddess, and in the sacramental banquet with its collops of flesh\r\nand spilth of ale and mead. But the experience of any bank holiday\r\nwill show that, for those who labour, the suspension of their ordinary\r\navocations does not mean quiescence. When the blood is heated with love\r\nand liquor, the nervous energies habitually devoted to wielding the\r\ngoad and guiding the plough must find vent in new and for the nonce\r\nunprofitable activities. But such activities, self-sufficing, and\r\nprimarily at least serving no end beyond themselves, are, from pushpin\r\nto poetry, exactly what is meant by play[485].\r\n\r\nThe instinct of play found a foothold at the village feast in the\r\ndébris which ritual, in its gradual transformation, left behind. It has\r\nalready been noted as a constant feature in the history of institutions\r\nthat a survival does not always remain merely a survival; it may be its\r\ndestiny, when it is emptied of its first significance, to be taken up\r\ninto a different order of ideas, and to receive a new lease of vitality\r\nunder a fresh interpretation. Sacrifice ceases to be sacrament and\r\nbecomes oblation. Dipping and smoking customs, originally magical, grow\r\nto be regarded as modes of sacrificial death. Other such waifs of the\r\npast become the inheritance of play. As the old conception of sacrifice\r\npassed into the new one, the subsidiary rites, through which the\r\nsacramental influence had of old been distributed over the worshippers\r\nand their fields, although by no means disused, lost their primitive\r\nmeaning. Similarly, when human sacrifice was abolished, that too left\r\ntraces of itself, only imperfectly intelligible, in mock or symbolical\r\ndeaths, or in the election of the temporary king. Thus, even before\r\nChristianity antiquated the whole structure of the village festivals,\r\nthere were individual practices kept alive only by the conservatism of\r\ntradition, and available as material for the play instinct. These find\r\nroom in the festivals side by side with other customs which the same\r\ninstinct not only preserved but initiated. Of course, the antithesis\r\nbetween play and cult must not be pushed too far. The peasant mind is\r\ntenacious of acts and forgetful of explanations; and the chapters to\r\ncome will afford examples of practices which, though they began in\r\nplay, came in time to have a serious significance of quasi-ritual, and\r\nto share in the popular imagination the prestige as fertility charms\r\nof the older ceremonies of worship with which they were associated.\r\nThe _ludi_ to be immediately discussed, however, present themselves\r\nin the main as sheer play. Several of them have broken loose from the\r\nfestivals altogether, or, if they still acknowledge their origin by\r\nmaking a special appearance on some fixed day, are also at the service\r\nof ordinary amusement, whenever the leisure or the whim of youth may so\r\nsuggest.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, it is possible that athletic sports and horse-racing are\r\nlargely an outcome of sacrificial festivals. Like the Greeks around\r\nthe pyre of Patroclus, the Teutons celebrated games at the tombs of\r\ntheir dead chieftains[486]. But games were a feature of seasonal,\r\nno less than funeral feasts. It will be remembered that the council\r\nof Clovesho took pains to forbid the keeping of the Rogation days\r\nwith horse-races. A bit of wrestling or a bout of quarter-staff is\r\nstill _de rigueur_ at many a wake or rushbearing, while in parts of\r\nGermany the winner of a race or of a shooting-match at the popinjay\r\nis entitled to light the festival fire, or to hold the desired office\r\nof May-king[487]. The reforming bishops of the thirteenth century\r\ninclude public wrestling-bouts and contests for prizes amongst the\r\n_ludi_ whose performance they condemn; and they lay particular stress\r\nupon a custom described as _arietum super ligna et rotas elevationes_.\r\nThe object of these ‘ram-raisings’ seems to be explained by the fact\r\nthat in the days of Chaucer a ram was the traditional reward proposed\r\nfor a successful wrestler[488]; and this perhaps enables us to push\r\nthe connexion with the sacrificial rite a little further. I would\r\nsuggest that the original object of the man who wrestled for a ram, or\r\nclimbed a greasy pole for a leg of mutton, or shot for a popinjay, was\r\nto win a sacrificial victim or a capital portion thereof, which buried\r\nin his field might bring him abundant crops. The orderly competition\r\ndoubtless evolved itself from such an indiscriminate scrimmage for the\r\nfertilizing fragments as marks the rites of the earth-goddess in the\r\nIndian village feast[489]. Tug-of-war would seem to be capable of a\r\nsimilar explanation, though here the desired object is not a portion\r\nof the victim, but rather a straw rope made out of the corn divinity\r\nitself in the form of the harvest-May[490]. An even closer analogy\r\nwith the Indian rite is afforded by such games as hockey and football.\r\nThe ball is nothing else than the head of the sacrificial beast, and\r\nit is the endeavour of each player to get it into his own possession,\r\nor, if sides are taken, to get it over a particular boundary[491].\r\nOriginally, of course, this was the player’s own boundary; it has come\r\nto be regarded as that of his opponents; but this inversion of the\r\npoint of view is not one on which much stress can be laid. In proof\r\nof this theory it may be pointed out that in many places football is\r\nstill played, traditionally, on certain days of the year. The most\r\nnotable example is perhaps at Dorking, where the annual Shrove Tuesday\r\nscrimmage in the streets of the town and the annual efforts of the\r\nlocal authorities to suppress it furnish their regular paragraph to the\r\nnewspapers. There are several others, in most of which, as at Dorking,\r\nthe contest is between two wards or districts of the town[492]. This\r\nfeature is repeated in the Shrove Tuesday tug-of-war at Ludlow, and\r\nin annual faction-fights elsewhere[493]. It is probably due to that\r\nσυνοικισμός of village communities by which towns often came into\r\nbeing. Here and there, moreover, there are to be found rude forms of\r\nfootball in which the primitive character of the proceeding is far more\r\nevident than in the sophisticated game. Two of these deserve especial\r\nmention. At Hallaton in Leicestershire a feast is held on Easter Monday\r\nat a piece of high ground called Hare-pie Bank. A hare--the sacrificial\r\ncharacter of the hare has already been dwelt upon--is carried in\r\nprocession. ‘Hare-pies’ are scrambled for; and then follows a sport\r\nknown as ‘bottle-kicking.’ Hooped wooden field-bottles are thrown down\r\nand a scrimmage ensues between the men of Hallaton and the men of the\r\nadjoining village of Medbourne. Besides the connexion with the hare\r\nsacrifice, it is noticeable that each party tries to drive the bottle\r\ntowards its own boundary, and not that of its opponents[494]. More\r\ninteresting still is the Epiphany struggle for the ‘Haxey hood’ at\r\nHaxey in Lincolnshire. The ‘hood’ is a roll of sacking or leather, and\r\nit is the object of each of the players to carry it to a public-house\r\nin his own village. The ceremony is connected with the Plough Monday\r\n_quête_, and the ‘plough-bullocks’ or ‘boggons’ led by their ‘lord\r\nduke’ and their ‘fool,’ known as ‘Billy Buck,’ are the presiding\r\nofficials. On the following day a festival-fire is lit, over which\r\nthe fool is ‘smoked.’ The strongest support is given to my theory\r\nof the origin of this type of game, by an extraordinary speech which\r\nthe fool delivers from the steps of an old cross. As usual, the cross\r\nhas taken the place of a more primitive tree or shrine. The speech\r\nruns as follows: ‘Now, good folks, this is Haxa’ Hood. We’ve killed\r\ntwo bullocks and a half, _but the other half we had to leave running\r\nfield_: we can fetch it if it’s wanted. Remember it’s\r\n\r\n    ‘Hoose agin hoose, toon agin toon,\r\n    And if you meet a man, knock him doon.’\r\n\r\nIn this case then, the popular memory has actually preserved the\r\ntradition that the ‘hood’ or ball played with is the half of a bullock,\r\nthe head that is to say, of the victim decapitated at a sacrifice[495].\r\n\r\nHockey and football and tug-of-war are lusty male sports, but the\r\nsacrificial survival recurs in some of the singing games played by\r\ngirls and children. The most interesting of these is that known as\r\n‘Oranges and Lemons.’ An arch is formed by two children with raised\r\nhands, and under this the rest of the players pass. Meanwhile rhymes\r\nare sung naming the bells of various parishes, and ending with some\r\nsuch formula as\r\n\r\n    ‘Here comes a chopper to chop off your head:\r\n    The last, last, last, last man’s head.’\r\n\r\nAs the last word is sung, the hands forming the arch are lowered,\r\nand the child who is then passing is caught, and falls in behind one\r\nof the leaders. When all in turn have been so caught, a tug-of-war,\r\nonly without a rope, follows. The ‘chopping’ obviously suggests a\r\nsacrifice, in this case a human sacrifice. And the bell-rhymes show the\r\nconnexion of the game with the parish contests just described. There\r\nexists indeed a precisely similar set of verses which has the title,\r\n_Song of the Bells of Derby on Football Morning_. The set ordinarily\r\nused in ‘Oranges and Lemons’ names London parishes, but here is a\r\nNorthamptonshire variant, which is particularly valuable because it\r\nalludes to another rite of the agricultural festival, the sacramental\r\ncake buried in a furrow:\r\n\r\n    ‘Pancakes and fritters,\r\n    Says the bells of St. Peter’s:\r\n    Where must we fry ’em?\r\n    Says the bells of Cold Higham:\r\n    In yonder land thurrow (furrow)\r\n    Says the bells of Wellingborough, &c.[496]’\r\n\r\nOther games of the same type are ‘How many Miles to Babylon,’ ‘Through\r\nthe Needle Eye,’ and ‘Tower of London.’ These add an important incident\r\nto ‘Oranges and Lemons,’ in that a ‘king’ is said to be passing through\r\nthe arch. On the other hand, some of them omit the tug-of-war[497].\r\nWith all these singing games it is a little difficult to say whether\r\nthey proceed from children’s imitations of the more serious proceedings\r\npf their elders, or whether they were originally played at the\r\nfestivals by grown men and maidens, and have gradually, like the May\r\n_quête_ itself, fallen into the children’s hands. The ‘Oranges and\r\nLemons’ group has its analogy to the tug-of-war; the use of the arch\r\nformation also connects it with the festival ‘country’ dances which\r\nwill be mentioned in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nThe rude punishments by which the far from rigid code of village\r\nethics vindicates itself against offenders, are on the border line\r\nbetween play and jurisprudence. These also appear to be in some cases\r\nsurvivals, diverted from their proper context, of festival usage. It\r\nhas been pointed out that the ducking which was a form of rain-charm\r\ncame to be used as a penalty for the churlish or dispirited person, who\r\ndeclined to throw up his work or to wear green on the festival day.\r\nIn other places this same person has to ‘ride the stang.’ That is to\r\nsay, he is set astride a pole and borne about with contumely, until\r\nhe compounds for his misdemeanour by a fine in coin or liquor[498].\r\n‘Riding the stang,’ however, is a rural punishment of somewhat wide\r\napplication[499]. It is common to England and to France, where it\r\ncan be traced back, under the names of _charivari_ and _chevauchée_,\r\nto the fifteenth century[500]. The French _sociétés joyeuses_, which\r\nwill be described in a later chapter, made liberal use of it[501]. The\r\noffences to which it is appropriate are various. A miser, a henpecked\r\nhusband or a wife-beater, especially in May, and, on the other hand,\r\na shrew or an unchaste woman, are liable to visitation, as are the\r\nparties to a second or third marriage, or to one perilously long\r\ndelayed, or one linking May to December. The precise ceremonial varies\r\nconsiderably. Sometimes the victim has to ride on a pole, sometimes on\r\na hobby-horse[502], or on an ass with his face turned to the tail[503].\r\nSometimes, again, he does not appear at all, but is represented by\r\nan effigy or guy, or, in France, by his next-door neighbour[504].\r\nThis dramatic version is, according to Mr. Barrett, properly called a\r\n‘skimmington riding,’ while the term ‘riding the stang’ is reserved\r\nfor that in which the offender figures in person. The din of kettles,\r\nbones, and cleavers, so frequent an element in rustic ceremonies, is\r\nfound here also, and in one locality at least the attendants are\r\naccustomed to blacken their faces[505]. It may perhaps be taken for\r\ngranted that ‘riding the stang’ is an earlier form of the punishment\r\nthan the more delicate and symbolical ‘skimmington riding’; and it\r\nis probable that the rider represents a primitive village criminal\r\nhaled off to become the literal victim at a sacrificial rite. The\r\nfine or forfeit by which in some cases the offence can be purged\r\nseems to create an analogy between the custom under consideration and\r\nother sacrificial survivals which must now be considered. These are\r\nperhaps best treated in connexion with Hock-tide and the curious play\r\nproper to that festival at Coventry[506]. This play was revived for\r\nthe entertainment of Elizabeth when she visited the Earl of Leicester\r\nat Kenilworth in July, 1575, and there exists a description of it in\r\na letter written by one Robert Laneham, who accompanied the court,\r\nto a friend in London[507]. The men of Coventry, led by one Captain\r\nCox, who presented it called it an ‘olld storiall sheaw,’ with for\r\nargument the massacre of the Danes by Ethelred on Saint Brice’s night\r\n1002[508]. Laneham says that it was ‘expressed in actionz and rymez,’\r\nand it appears from his account to have been a kind of sham fight\r\nor ‘barriers’ between two parties representing respectively Danish\r\n‘launsknights’ and English, ‘each with allder poll marcially in their\r\nhand[509].’ In the end the Danes were defeated and ‘many led captiue\r\nfor triumph by our English wéemen.’ The presenters also stated that\r\nthe play was of ‘an auncient beginning’ and ‘woont too bee plaid in\r\noour Citee yeárely.’ Of late, however, it had been ‘laid dooun,’ owing\r\nto the importunity of their preachers, and ‘they woold make theyr\r\nhumbl peticion vntoo her highnes, that they myght haue theyr playz vp\r\nagayn.’ The records of Coventry itself add but little to what Laneham\r\ngathered. The local _Annals_, not a very trustworthy chronicle, ascribe\r\nthe invention of ‘Hox Tuesday’ to 1416-7, and perhaps confirm the\r\n_Letter_ by noting that in 1575-6 the ‘pageants on Hox Tuesday’ were\r\nplayed after eight years[510]. We have seen that, according to the\r\nstatement made at Kenilworth, the event commemorated by the performance\r\nwas the Danish massacre of 1002. There was, however, another tradition,\r\npreserved by the fifteenth-century writer John Rous, which connected it\r\nrather with the sudden death of Hardicanute and the end of the Danish\r\nusurpation at the accession of Edward the Confessor[511]. It is, of\r\ncourse, possible that local _cantilenae_ on either or both of these\r\nevents may have existed, and may have been worked into the ‘rymez’\r\nof the play. But I think it may be taken for granted that, as in the\r\nLady Godiva procession, the historical element is comparatively a late\r\none, which has been grafted upon already existing festival customs.\r\nOne of these is perhaps the faction-fight just discussed. But it is\r\nto be noticed that the performance as described by Laneham ended with\r\nthe Danes being led away captive by English women; and this episode\r\nseems to be clearly a dramatization of a characteristic Hock-tide\r\n_ludus_ found in many places other than Coventry. On Hock-Monday, the\r\nwomen ‘hocked’ the men; that is to say, they went abroad with ropes,\r\ncaught and bound any man they came across, and exacted a forfeit. On\r\nHock-Tuesday, the men retaliated in similar fashion upon the women.\r\nBishop Carpenter of Worcester forbade this practice in his diocese\r\nin 1450[512], but like some other festival customs it came to be\r\nrecognized as a source of parochial revenue, and the ‘gaderyngs’\r\nat Hock-tide, of which the women’s was always the most productive,\r\nfigure in many a churchwarden’s budget well into the seventeenth\r\ncentury[513]. At Shrewsbury in 1549 ‘hocking’ led to a tragedy. Two men\r\nwere ‘smothered under the Castle hill,’ hiding themselves from maids,\r\nthe hill falling there on them[514].’ ‘Hockney day’ is still kept at\r\nHungerford, and amongst the old-fashioned officers elected on this\r\noccasion, with the hay-ward and the ale-tasters, are the two ‘tything\r\nmen’ or ‘tutti men,’ somewhat doubtfully said to be so named from their\r\npoles wreathed with ‘tutties’ or nose-gays, whose function it is to\r\nvisit the commoners, and to claim from every man a coin and from every\r\nwoman a kiss[515]. The derivation of the term Hock-tide has given rise\r\nto some wild conjectures, and philologists have failed to come to a\r\nconclusion on the subject[516]. Hock-tide is properly the Monday and\r\nTuesday following the Second Sunday after Easter, and ‘Hokedaie’ or\r\n_Quindena Paschae_ is a frequent term day in leases and other legal\r\ndocuments from the thirteenth century onwards[517].\r\n\r\n‘Hocking’ can be closely paralleled from other customs of the spring\r\nfestivals. The household books of Edward I record in 1290 a payment\r\n‘to seven ladies of the queen’s chamber who took the king in bed\r\non the morrow of Easter, and made him fine himself[518].’ This was\r\nthe _prisio_ which at a later date perturbed the peace of French\r\necclesiastics. The council of Nantes, for instance, in 1431, complains\r\nthat clergy were hurried out of their beds on Easter Monday, dragged\r\ninto church, and sprinkled with water upon the altar[519]. In this\r\naggravated form the _prisio_ hardly survived the frank manners of\r\nthe Middle Ages. But it was essentially identical with the ceremonies\r\nin which a more modern usage has permitted the levying of forfeits at\r\nboth Pasque and Pentecost. In the north of England, women were liable\r\nto have their shoes taken on one or other of these feasts, and must\r\nredeem them by payment. On the following day they were entitled to\r\nretaliate on the shoes of the men[520]. A more widely spread method of\r\nexacting the _droit_ is that of ‘heaving.’ The unwary wanderer in some\r\nof the northern manufacturing towns on Easter Monday is still liable\r\nto find himself swung high in the air by the stalwart hands of factory\r\ngirls, and will be lucky if he can purchase his liberty with nothing\r\nmore costly than a kiss. If he likes, he may take his revenge on Easter\r\nTuesday[521]. Another mediaeval custom described by Belethus in the\r\ntwelfth century, which prescribed the whipping of husbands by wives\r\non Easter Monday and of wives by husbands on Easter Tuesday, has also\r\nits modern parallel[522]. On Shrove Tuesday a hockey match was played\r\nat Leicester, and after it a number of young men took their stand with\r\ncart whips in the precincts of the Castle. Any passer-by who did not\r\npay a forfeit was liable to lashes. The ‘whipping Toms,’ as they were\r\ncalled, were put down by a special Act of Parliament in 1847[523].\r\nThe analogy of these customs with the requirement made of visitors to\r\ncertain markets or to the roofs of houses in the building to ‘pay their\r\nfooting’ is obvious[524].\r\n\r\nIn all these cases, even where the significant whipping or sprinkling\r\nis absent, the meaning is the same. The binding with ropes, the loss\r\nof the shoes, the lifting in the air, are symbols of capture. And the\r\ncapture is for the purposes of sacrifice, for which no more suitable\r\nvictim, in substitution for the priest-king, than a stranger, could be\r\nfound. This will, I think, be clear by comparison with some further\r\nparallels from the harvest field and the threshing-floor, in more\r\nthan one of which the symbolism is such as actually to indicate the\r\nsacrifice itself, as well as the preliminary capture. In many parts\r\nof England a stranger, and sometimes even the farmer himself, when\r\nvisiting a harvest field, is liable to be asked for ‘largess’[525]. In\r\nScotland, the tribute is called ‘head-money,’ and he who refuses is\r\nseized by the arms and feet and ‘dumped’ on the ground[526]. Similar\r\ncustoms prevail on the continent, in Germany, Norway, France; and the\r\nstranger is often, just as in the ‘hocking’ ceremony, caught with\r\nstraw ropes, or swathed in a sheaf of corn. It is mainly in Germany\r\nthat the still more elaborate rites survive. In various districts\r\nof Mecklenburg, and of Pomerania, the reapers form a ring round the\r\nstranger, and fiercely whet their scythes, sometimes with traditional\r\nrhymes which contain a threat to mow him down. In Schleswig, and\r\nagain in Sweden, the stranger in a threshing-floor is ‘taught the\r\nflail-dance’ or ‘the threshing-song.’ The arms of a flail are put round\r\nhis neck and pressed so tightly that he is nearly choked. When the\r\nmadder-roots are being dug, a stranger passing the field is caught by\r\nthe workers, and buried up to his middle in the soil[527].\r\n\r\nThe central incident of ‘hocking’ appears therefore to be nothing but\r\na form of that symbolical capture of a human victim of which various\r\nother examples are afforded by the village festivals. The development\r\nof the custom into a play or mock-fight at Coventry may very well\r\nhave taken place, as the town annals say, about the beginning of the\r\nfifteenth century. Whether it had previously been connected by local\r\ntradition with some event in the struggles of Danes and Saxons or not,\r\nis a question which one must be content to leave unsolved. A final\r\nword is due to the curious arrangement by which in the group of customs\r\nhere considered the rôles of sacrificers and sacrificed are exchanged\r\nbetween men and women on the second day; for it lends support to the\r\ntheory already put forward that a certain stage in the evolution of the\r\nvillage worship was marked by the merging of previously independent\r\nsex-cults.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                             THE MAY-GAME\r\n\r\n    [_Bibliographical Note._--The festal character of primitive\r\n    dance and song is admirably brought out by R. Wallaschek,\r\n    _Primitive Music_ (1893); E. Grosse, _Die Anfänge der Kunst_\r\n    (1894, French transl. 1902); Y. Hirn, _The Origins of Art_\r\n    (1900); F. B. Gummere, _The Beginnings of Poetry_ (1901). The\r\n    popular element in French lyric is illustrated by A. Jeanroy,\r\n    _Les Origines de la Poésie lyrique en France au Moyen Âge_\r\n    (1889), and J. Tiersot, _Histoire de la Chanson populaire en\r\n    France_ (1889). Most of such English material as exists is\r\n    collected in Mrs. Gomme’s _Traditional Games_ (1896-8) and G. F.\r\n    Northall, _English Folk-Rhymes_ (1892). For comparative study E.\r\n    Martinengo-Cesaresco, _Essays in the Study of Folk-Songs_ (1886),\r\n    may be consulted. The notices of the May-game are scattered\r\n    through the works mentioned in the bibliographical note to ch. vi\r\n    and others.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing chapter has illustrated the remarkable variety of modes\r\nin which the instinct of play comes to find expression. But of all such\r\nthe simplest and most primitive is undoubtedly the dance. Psychology\r\ndiscovers in the dance the most rudimentary and physical of the arts,\r\nand traces it to precisely that overflow of nervous energies shut off\r\nfrom their normal practical ends which constitutes play[528]. And\r\nthe verdict of psychology is confirmed by philology; for in all the\r\nGermanic languages the same word signifies both ‘dance’ and ‘play,’ and\r\nin some of them it is even extended to the cognate ideas of ‘sacrifice’\r\nor ‘festival[529]’. The dance must therefore be thought of as an\r\nessential part of all the festivals with which we have to deal. And\r\nwith the dance comes song: the rhythms of motion seem to have been\r\ninvariably accompanied by the rhythms of musical instruments, or of the\r\nvoice, or of both combined[530].\r\n\r\nThe dance had been from the beginning a subject of contention between\r\nChristianity and the Roman world[531]; but whereas the dances of\r\nthe East and South, so obnoxious to the early Fathers, were mainly\r\nthose of professional entertainers, upon the stage or at banquets,\r\nthe missionaries of the West had to face the even more difficult\r\nproblem of a folk-dance and folk-song which were amongst the most\r\ninveterate habits of the freshly converted peoples. As the old worship\r\nvanished, these tended to attach themselves to the new. Upon great\r\nfeasts and wake-days, choruses of women invaded with wanton _cantica_\r\nand _ballationes_ the precincts of the churches and even the sacred\r\nbuildings themselves, a desecration against which generation after\r\ngeneration of ecclesiastical authorities was fain to protest[532].\r\nClerkly sentiment in the matter is represented by a pious legend,\r\nvery popular in the Middle Ages, which told how some reprobate folk\r\nof Kölbigk in Anhalt disobeyed the command of a priest to cease their\r\nunholy revels before the church of Saint Magnus while he said mass on\r\nChristmas day, and for their punishment must dance there the year round\r\nwithout stopping[533]. The struggle was a long one, and in the end the\r\nChurch never quite succeeded even in expelling the dance from its own\r\ndoors. The chapter of Wells about 1338 forbade _choreae_ and other\r\n_ludi_ within the cathedral and the cloisters, chiefly on account of\r\nthe damage too often done to its property[534]. A seventeenth-century\r\nFrench writer records that he had seen clergy and singing-boys dancing\r\nat Easter in the churches of Paris[535]; and even at the present day\r\nthere are some astounding survivals. At Seville, as is well known, the\r\nsix boys, called _los Seises_, dance with castanets before the Holy\r\nSacrament in the presence of the archbishop at Shrovetide, and during\r\nthe feasts of the Immaculate Conception and Corpus Christi[536]. At\r\nEchternach in Luxembourg there is an annual dance through the church\r\nof pilgrims to the shrine of St. Willibrord[537], while at Barjols\r\nin Provence a ‘tripe-dance’ is danced at mass on St. Marcel’s day in\r\nhonour of the patron[538].\r\n\r\nStill less, of course, did dance and song cease to be important\r\nfeatures of the secular side of the festivals. We have already seen\r\nhow _cantilenae_ on the great deeds of heroes had their vogue in the\r\nmouths of the _chori_ of young men and maidens, as well as in those\r\nof the minstrels[539]. The _Carmina Burana_ describe the dances\r\nof girls upon the meadows as amongst the pleasures of spring[540].\r\nWilliam Fitzstephen tells us that such dances were to be seen in\r\nLondon in the twelfth century[541], and we have found the University\r\nof Oxford solemnly forbidding them in the thirteenth. The _romans_ and\r\n_pastourelles_ frequently mention _chansons_ or _rondets de carole_,\r\nwhich appear to have been the _chansons_ used to accompany the choric\r\ndances, and to have generally consisted of a series of couplets sung\r\nby the leader, and a refrain with which the rest of the band answered\r\nhim. Occasionally the refrains are quoted[542]. The minstrels borrowed\r\nthis type of folk _chanson_, and the conjoint dance and song themselves\r\nfound their way from the village green to the courtly hall. In the\r\ntwelfth century ladies _carolent_, and more rarely even men condescend\r\nto take a part[543]. Still later _carole_, like _tripudium_, seems\r\nto become a term for popular rejoicing in general, not necessarily\r\nexpressed in rhythmical shape[544].\r\n\r\nThe customs of the village festival gave rise by natural development\r\nto two types of dance[545]. There was the processional dance of the\r\nband of worshippers in progress round their boundaries and from field\r\nto field, from house to house, from well to well of the village. It\r\nis this that survives in the dance of the Echternach pilgrims, or in\r\nthe ‘faddy-dance’ in and out the cottage doors at Helston wake. And\r\nit is probably this that is at the bottom of the interesting game of\r\n‘Thread the Needle.’ This is something like ‘Oranges and Lemons,’ the\r\nfirst part of which, indeed, seems to have been adapted from it. There\r\nis, however, no sacrifice or ‘tug-of-war,’ although there is sometimes\r\na ‘king,’ or a ‘king’ and his ‘lady’ or ‘bride’ in the accompanying\r\nrhymes, and in one instance a ‘pancake.’ The players stand in two long\r\nlines. Those at the end of each line form an arch with uplifted arms,\r\nand the rest run in pairs beneath it. Then another pair form an arch,\r\nand the process is repeated. In this way long strings of lads and\r\nlasses stream up and down the streets or round and about a meadow or\r\ngreen. In many parts of England this game is played annually on Shrove\r\nTuesday or Easter Monday, and the peasants who play it at Châtre in\r\ncentral France say that it is done ‘to make the hemp grow.’ Its origin\r\nin connexion with the agricultural festivals can therefore hardly be\r\ndoubtful[546]. It is probable that in the beginning the players danced\r\nrather than ran under the ‘arch’; and it is obvious that the ‘figure’\r\nof the game is practically identical with one familiar in _Sir Roger de\r\nCoverley_ and other old English ‘country’ dances of the same type.\r\n\r\nJust as the ‘country’ dance is derived from the processional dance, so\r\nthe other type of folk-dance, the _ronde_ or ‘round,’ is derived from\r\nthe comparatively stationary dance of the group of worshippers around\r\nthe more especially sacred objects of the festival, such as the tree\r\nor the fire[547]. The custom of dancing round the May-pole has been\r\nmore or less preserved wherever the May-pole is known. But ‘Thread\r\nthe Needle’ itself often winds up with a circular dance or _ronde_,\r\neither around one of the players, or, on festival occasions, around\r\nthe representative of the earlier home of the fertilization divinity,\r\nthe parish church. This custom is popularly known as ‘clipping the\r\nchurch[548].’\r\n\r\nNaturally the worshippers at a festival would dance in their festival\r\ncostume; that is to say, in the garb of leaves and flowers worn for the\r\nsake of the beneficent influence of the indwelling divinity, or in the\r\nhides and horns of sacrificial animals which served a similar purpose.\r\nTravellers describe elaborate and beautiful beast-dances amongst savage\r\npeoples, and the Greeks had their own bear- and crane-dances, as well\r\nas the dithyrambic goat-dance of the Dionysia. They had also flower\r\ndances[549]. In England the village dancers wear posies, but I do not\r\nknow that they ever attempt a more elaborate representation of flowers.\r\nBut a good example of the beast-dance is furnished by the ‘horn-dance’\r\nat Abbots Bromley in Staffordshire, held now at a September wake,\r\nand formerly at Christmas. In this six of the performers wear sets\r\nof horns. These are preserved from year to year in the church, and\r\naccording to local tradition the dance used at one time to take place\r\nin the churchyard on a Sunday. The horns are said to be those of the\r\nreindeer, and from this it may possibly be inferred that they were\r\nbrought to Abbots Bromley by Scandinavian settlers. The remaining\r\nperformers represent a hobby-horse, a clown, a woman, and an archer,\r\nwho makes believe to shoot the horned men[550].\r\n\r\nThe _motifs_ of the dances and their _chansons_ must also at first\r\nhave been determined by the nature of the festivals at which they\r\ntook place. There were dances, no doubt, at such domestic festivals\r\nas weddings and funerals[551]. In Flanders it is still the custom to\r\ndance at the funeral of a young girl, and a very charming _chanson_\r\nis used[552]. The development of epic poetry from the _cantilenae_\r\nof the war-festival has been noted in a former chapter. At the\r\nagricultural festivals, the primary _motif_ is, of course, the desire\r\nfor the fertility of the crops and herds. The song becomes, as in the\r\nAnglo-Saxon charm, so often referred to, practically a prayer[553].\r\nWith this, and with the use of ‘Thread the Needle’ at Châtre ‘to make\r\nthe hemp grow,’ may be compared the games known to modern children,\r\nas to Gargantua, in which the operations of the farmer’s year, and in\r\nparticular his prayer for his crops, are mimicked in a _ronde_[554].\r\nAllusions to the process of the seasons, above all to the delight of\r\nthe _renouveau_ in spring, would naturally also find a place in the\r\nfestival songs. The words of the famous thirteenth-century lyric were\r\nperhaps written to be sung to the twinkling feet of English girls in a\r\nround. It has the necessary refrain:\r\n\r\n    ‘Sumer is icumen in,\r\n      Lhude sing cuccu!\r\n    Groweth sed and bloweth med\r\n      And springth the wdë nu,\r\n                      Sing cuccu!\r\n\r\n    ‘Awë bleteth after lomb,\r\n      Lhouth after calvë cu.\r\n    Bulloc sterteth, buckë verteth,\r\n      Murie sing cuccu!\r\n\r\n    ‘Cuccu, cuccu, wel singës thu, cuccu;\r\n      Ne swik thu naver nu.\r\n    Sing cuccu nu. Sing cuccu.\r\n      Sing cuccu. Sing cuccu nu!’[555]\r\n\r\nThe savour of the spring is still in the English May songs, the French\r\n_maierolles_ or _calendes de mai_ and the Italian _calen di maggio_.\r\nBut for the rest they have either become little but mere _quête_ songs,\r\nor else, under the influence of the priests, have taken on a Christian\r\ncolouring[556]. At Oxford the ‘merry ketches’ sung by choristers on the\r\ntop of Magdalen tower on May morning were replaced in the seventeenth\r\ncentury by the hymn now used[557]. Another very popular Mayers’ song\r\nwould seem to show that the Puritans, in despair of abolishing the\r\nfestival, tried to reform it.\r\n\r\n    ‘Remember us poor Mayers all,\r\n      And thus we do begin\r\n    To lead our lives in righteousness,\r\n      Or else we die in sin.\r\n\r\n    ‘We have been rambling all this night,\r\n      And almost all this day:\r\n    And now returned back again,\r\n      We have brought you a branch of May.\r\n\r\n    ‘A branch of May we have brought you,\r\n      And at your door it stands;\r\n    It is but a sprout, but it’s well budded out,\r\n      By the work of our Lord’s hands,’ &c.[558]\r\n\r\nAnother religious element, besides prayer, may have entered into\r\nthe pre-Christian festival songs; and that is myth. A stage in the\r\nevolution of drama from the Dionysiac dithyramb was the introduction of\r\nmythical narratives about the wanderings and victories of the god, to\r\nbe chanted or recited by the _choragus_. The relation of the _choragus_\r\nto the _chorus_ bears a close analogy to that between the leader of\r\nthe mediaeval _carole_ and his companions who sang the refrain. This\r\nleader probably represents the Keltic or Teutonic priest at the head\r\nof his band of worshippers; and one may suspect that in the north and\r\nwest of Europe, as in Greece, the pauses of the festival dance provided\r\nthe occasion on which the earliest strata of stories about the gods,\r\nthe hieratic as distinguished from the literary myths, took shape. If\r\nso the development of divine myth was very closely parallel to that of\r\nheroic myth[559].\r\n\r\nAfter religion, the commonest _motif_ of dance and song at the village\r\nfestivals must have been love. This is quite in keeping with the\r\namorous licence which was one of their characteristics. The goddess\r\nof the fertility of earth was also the goddess of the fertility of\r\nwomen. The ecclesiastical prohibitions lay particular stress upon the\r\n_orationes amatoriae_ and the _cantica turpia et luxuriosa_ which\r\nthe women sang at the church doors, and only as love-songs can be\r\ninterpreted the _winileodi_ forbidden to the inmates of convents by a\r\ncapitulary of 789[560]. The love-interest continues to be prominent\r\nin the folk-song, or the minstrel song still in close relation to\r\nfolk-song, of mediaeval and modern France. The beautiful wooing\r\n_chanson_ of _Transformations_, which savants have found it difficult\r\nto believe not to be a _supercherie_, is sung by harvesters and by\r\nlace-makers at the pillow[561]. That of _Marion_, an ironic expression\r\nof wifely submission, belongs to Shrove Tuesday[562]. These are modern,\r\nbut the following, from the _Chansonnier de St. Germain_, may be a\r\ngenuine mediaeval folk-song of Limousin _provenance_:\r\n\r\n    ‘A l’entrada dal tems clar, eya,\r\n    Per joja recomençar, eya,\r\n    Et per jelos irritar, eya,\r\n    Vol la regina mostrar\r\n    Qu’el’ es si amoroza.\r\n    Alavi’, alavia jelos,\r\n    Laissaz nos, laissaz nos\r\n    Ballar entre nos, entre nos[563].’\r\n\r\nThe ‘queen’ here is, of course, the festival queen or lady of the May,\r\nthe _regina avrillosa_ of the Latin writers, _la reine_, _la mariée_,\r\n_l’épousée_, _la trimousette_ of popular custom[564]. The defiance\r\nof the _jelos_, and the desire of the queen and her maidens to dance\r\nalone, recall the conventional freedom of women from restraint in May,\r\nthe month of their ancient sex-festival, and the month in which the\r\nmediaeval wife-beater still ran notable danger of a _chevauchée_.\r\n\r\nThe amorous note recurs in those types of minstrel song which are\r\nmost directly founded upon folk models. Such are the _chansons à\r\ndanser_ with their refrains, the _chansons de mal mariées_, in\r\nwhich the ‘_jalous_’ is often introduced, the _aubes_ and the\r\n_pastourelles_[565]. Common in all of these is the spring setting\r\nproper to the _chansons_ of our festivals, and of the ‘queen’ or\r\n‘king’ there is from time to time mention. The leading theme of\r\nthe _pastourelles_ is the wooing, successful or the reverse, of a\r\nshepherdess by a knight. But the shepherdess has generally also a lover\r\nof her own degree, and for this pair the names of Robin and Marion seem\r\nto have been conventionally appropriated. Robin was perhaps borrowed by\r\nthe _pastourelles_ from the widely spread refrain\r\n\r\n    ‘Robins m’aime, Robins m’a:\r\n    Robins m’a demandée: si m’ara[566].’\r\n\r\nThe borrowing may, of course, have been the other way round, but the\r\nclose relation of the _chanson à danser_ with its refrain to the\r\ndance suggests that this was the earliest type of lyric minstrelsy\r\nto be evolved, as well as the closest to the folk-song pattern. The\r\n_pastourelle_ forms a link between folk-song and drama, for towards\r\nthe end of the thirteenth century Adan de la Hale, known as ‘le\r\nBossu,’ a minstrel of Arras, wrote a _Jeu de Robin et Marion_, which\r\nis practically a _pastourelle par personnages_. The familiar theme\r\nis preserved. A knight woos Marion, who is faithful to her Robin.\r\nRepulsed, he rides away, but returns and beats Robin. All, however,\r\nends happily with dances and _jeux_ amongst the peasants. Adan de la\r\nHale was one of the train of Count Robert of Artois in Italy. The play\r\nmay originally have been written about 1283 for the delectation of the\r\ncourt of Robert’s kinsman, Charles, king of Naples, but the extant\r\nversion was probably produced about 1290 at Arras, when the poet was\r\nalready dead. Another hand has prefixed a dramatic prologue, the _Jeu\r\ndu Pèlerin_, glorifying Adan, and has also made some interpolations in\r\nthe text designed to localize the action near Arras. The performers\r\nare not likely to have been villagers: they may have been the members\r\nof some _puy_ or literary society, which had taken over the celebration\r\nof the summer festival. In any case the _Jeu de Robin et Marion_ is the\r\nearliest and not the least charming of pastoral comedies[567].\r\n\r\nIt is impossible exactly to parallel from the history of English\r\nliterature this interaction of folk-song and minstrelsy at the French\r\n_fête du mai_. For unfortunately no body of English mediaeval lyric\r\nexists. Even ‘Sumer is icumen in’ only owes its preservation to the\r\nhappy accident which led some priest to fit sacred words to the secular\r\ntune; while the few pieces recovered from a Harleian manuscript of the\r\nreign of Edward I, beautiful as they are, read like adaptations less of\r\nEnglish folk-song, than of French lyric itself[568]. Nevertheless, the\r\nvillage summer festival of England seems to have closely resembled that\r\nof France, and to have likewise taken in the long run a dramatic turn.\r\nA short sketch of it will not be without interest.\r\n\r\nI have quoted at the beginning of this discussion of folk-customs the\r\nthirteenth-century condemnations of the _Inductio Maii_ by Bishop\r\nGrosseteste of Lincoln and of the _ludi de Rege et Regina_ by Bishop\r\nChanteloup of Worcester. The _ludus de Rege et Regina_ is not indeed\r\nnecessarily to be identified with the _Inductio Maii_, for the harvest\r\nfeast or _Inductio Autumni_ of Bishop Grosseteste had also its\r\n‘king’ and ‘queen,’ and so too had some of the feasts in the winter\r\ncycle, notably Twelfth night[569]. It is, however, in the summer\r\nfeast held usually on the first of May or at Whitsuntide[570], that\r\nthese rustic dignitaries are more particularly prominent. Before the\r\nmiddle of the fifteenth century I have not come across many notices\r\nof them. That a summer king was familiar in Scotland is implied by\r\nthe jest of Robert Bruce’s wife after his coronation at Scone in\r\n1306[571]. In 1412 a ‘somerkyng’ received a reward from the bursar of\r\nWinchester College[572]. But from about 1450 onwards they begin to\r\nappear frequently in local records. The whole _ludus_ is generally\r\nknown as a ‘May-play’ or ‘May-game,’ or as a ‘king-play[573],’\r\n‘king’s revel[574],’ or ‘king-game[575].’ The leading personages\r\nare indifferently the ‘king’ and ‘queen,’ or ‘lord’ and ‘lady.’ But\r\nsometimes the king is more specifically the ‘somerkyng’ or _rex\r\naestivalis_. At other times he is the ‘lord of misrule[576],’ or takes\r\na local title, such as that of the ‘Abbot of Marham,’ ‘Mardall,’\r\n‘Marrall,’ ‘Marram,’ ‘Mayvole’ or ‘Mayvoll’ at Shrewsbury[577], and the\r\n‘Abbot of Bon-Accord’ at Aberdeen[578]. The use of an ecclesiastical\r\nterm will be explained in a later chapter[579]. The queen appears to\r\nhave been sometimes known as a ‘whitepot’ queen[580]. And finally\r\nthe king and queen receive, in many widely separated places, the\r\nnames of Robin Hood and Maid Marian, and are accompanied in their\r\nrevels by Little John, Friar Tuck, and the whole joyous fellowship\r\nof Sherwood Forest[581]. This affiliation of the _ludus de Rege et\r\nRegina_ to the Robin Hood legend is so curious as to deserve a moment’s\r\nexamination[582].\r\n\r\nThe earliest recorded mention of Robin Hood is in Langland’s _Piers\r\nPlowman_, written about 1377. Here he is coupled with another great\r\npopular hero of the north as a subject of current songs:\r\n\r\n    ‘But I can rymes of Robyn hood, and Randolf erle of Chestre[583].’\r\n\r\nIn the following century his fame as a great outlaw spread far and\r\nwide, especially in the north and the midlands[584]. The Scottish\r\nchronicler Bower tells us in 1447 that whether for comedy or tragedy\r\nno other subject of romance and minstrelsy had such a hold upon\r\nthe common folk[585]. The first of the extant ballads of the cycle,\r\n_A Gest of Robyn Hode_, was probably printed before 1500, and in\r\ncomposition may be at least a century earlier. A recent investigator\r\nof the legend, and a very able one, denies to Robin Hood any traceable\r\nhistoric origin. He is, says Dr. Child, ‘absolutely a creation of the\r\nballad muse.’ However this may be, the version of the Elizabethan\r\nplaywright Anthony Munday, who made him an earl of Huntingdon and\r\nthe lover of Matilda the daughter of Lord Fitzwater, may be taken\r\nas merely a fabrication. And whether he is historical or not, it is\r\ndifficult to see how he got, as by the sixteenth century he did get,\r\ninto the May-game. One theory is that he was there from the beginning,\r\nand that he is in fact a mythological figure, whose name but faintly\r\ndisguises either Woden in the aspect of a vegetation deity[586], or\r\na minor wood-spirit Hode, who also survives in the Hodeken of German\r\nlegend[587]. Against this it may be pointed out, firstly that Hood is\r\nnot an uncommon English name, probably meaning nothing but ‘à-Wood’ or\r\n‘of the wood[588],’ and secondly that we have seen no reason to suppose\r\nthat the mock king, which is the part assigned to Robin Hood in the\r\nMay-game, was ever regarded as an incarnation of the fertilization\r\nspirit at all. He is the priest of that spirit, slain at its festival,\r\nbut nothing more. I venture to offer a more plausible explanation. It\r\nis noticeable that whereas in the May-game Robin Hood and Maid Marian\r\nare inseparable, in the early ballads Maid Marian has no part. She\r\nis barely mentioned in one or two of the latest ones[589]. Moreover\r\nMarian is not an English but a French name, and we have already seen\r\nthat Robin and Marion are the typical shepherd and shepherdess of the\r\nFrench _pastourelles_ and of Adan de la Hale’s dramatic _jeu_ founded\r\nupon these. I suggest then, that the names were introduced by the\r\nminstrels into English and transferred from the French _fêtes du mai_\r\nto the ‘lord’ and ‘lady’ of the corresponding English May-game. Robin\r\nHood grew up independently from heroic _cantilenae_, but owing to the\r\nsimilarity of name he was identified with the other Robin, and brought\r\nLittle John, Friar Tuck and the rest with him into the May-game. On\r\nthe other hand Maid Marian, who does not properly belong to the heroic\r\nlegend, was in turn, naturally enough, adopted into the later ballads.\r\nThis is an hypothesis, but not, I think, an unlikely hypothesis.\r\n\r\nOf what, then, did the May-game, as it took shape in the fifteenth\r\nand sixteenth centuries, consist? Primarily, no doubt, of a _quête_\r\nor ‘gaderyng.’ In many places this became a parochial, or even a\r\nmunicipal, affair. In 1498 the corporation of Wells possessed moneys\r\n‘_provenientes ante hoc tempus de Robynhode_[590].’ Elsewhere the\r\nchurchwardens paid the expenses of the feast and accounted for the\r\nreceipts in the annual parish budget[591]. There are many entries\r\nconcerning the May-game in the accounts of Kingston-on-Thames during\r\nsome half a century. In 1506 it is recorded that ‘Wylm. Kempe’ was\r\n‘kenge’ and ‘Joan Whytebrede’ was ‘quen.’ In 1513 and again in 1536\r\nthe game went to Croydon[592]. Similarly the accounts of New Romney\r\nnote that in 1422 or thereabouts the men of Lydd ‘came with their may\r\nand ours[593],’ and those of Reading St. Lawrence that in 1505 came\r\n‘Robyn Hod of Handley and his company’ and in 1507 ‘Robyn Hod and his\r\ncompany from ffynchamsted[594].’ In contemporary Scotland James IV\r\ngave a present at midsummer in 1503 ‘to Robin Hude of Perth[595].’ It\r\nwould hardly have been worth while, however, to carry the May-game from\r\none village or town to another, had it been nothing but a procession\r\nwith a garland and a ‘gaderyng’; and as a matter of fact we find that\r\nin England as in France dramatic performances came to be associated\r\nwith the summer folk-festivals. The London ‘Maying’ included stage\r\nplays[596]. At Shrewsbury _lusores_ under the Abbot of Marham acted\r\ninterludes ‘for the glee of the town’ at Pentecost[597]. The guild of\r\nSt. Luke at Norwich performed secular as well as miracle plays, and the\r\nguild of Holy Cross at Abingdon held its feast on May 3 with ‘pageants,\r\nplays and May-games,’ as early as 1445[598]. Some of these plays were\r\ndoubtless miracles, but so far as they were secular, the subjects of\r\nthem were naturally drawn, in the absence of _pastourelles_, from the\r\nballads of the Robin Hood cycle[599]. Amongst the Paston letters is\r\npreserved one written in 1473, in which the writer laments the loss\r\nof a servant, whom he has kept ‘thys iij yer to pleye Seynt Jorge and\r\nRobyn Hod and the Shryff off Nottyngham[600].’ Moreover, some specimens\r\nof the plays themselves are still extant. One of them, unfortunately\r\nonly a fragment, must be the very play referred to in the letter just\r\nquoted, for its subject is ‘Robin Hood and the Sheriff of Nottingham,’\r\nand it is found on a scrap of paper formerly in the possession of Sir\r\nJohn Fenn, the first editor of the _Paston Letters_[601]. A second\r\nplay on ‘Robin Hood and the Friar’ and a fragment of a third on ‘Robin\r\nHood and the Potter’ were printed by Copland in the edition of the\r\n_Gest of Robyn Hode_ published by him about 1550[602]. The Robin Hood\r\nplays are, of course, subsequent to the development of religious drama\r\nwhich will be discussed in the next volume. They are of the nature of\r\ninterludes, and were doubtless written, like the plays of Adan de la\r\nHale, by some clerk or minstrel for the delectation of the villagers.\r\nThey are, therefore, in a less degree folk-drama, than the examples\r\nwhich we shall have to consider in the next chapter. But it is worthy\r\nof notice, that even in the hey-day of the stage under Elizabeth\r\nand James I, the summer festival continued to supply motives to the\r\ndramatists. Anthony Munday’s _Downfall and Death of Robert Earl of\r\nHuntingdon_[603], Chapman’s _May-Day_, and Jonson’s delightful fragment\r\n_The Sad Shepherd_ form an interesting group of pastoral comedies,\r\naffinities to which may be traced in the _As You Like It_ and _Winter’s\r\nTale_ of Shakespeare himself.\r\n\r\nAs has been said, it is impossible to establish any direct affiliation\r\nbetween the Robin Hood plays and earlier _caroles_ on the same theme,\r\nin the way in which this can be done for the _jeu_ of Adan de la Hale,\r\nand the Robin and Marion of the _pastourelles_. The extant Robin Hood\r\nballads are certainly not _caroles_; they are probably not folk-song at\r\nall, but minstrelsy of a somewhat debased type. The only actual trace\r\nof such _caroles_ that has been come across is the mention of ‘Robene\r\nhude’ as the name of a dance in the _Complaynt of Scotland_ about\r\n1548[604]. Dances, however, of one kind or another, there undoubtedly\r\nwere at the May-games. The Wells corporation accounts mention _puellae\r\ntripudiantes_ in close relation with _Robynhode_[605]. And particularly\r\nthere was the morris-dance, which was so universally in use on May-day,\r\nthat it borrowed, almost in permanence, for its leading character the\r\nname of Maid Marian. The morris-dance, however, is common to nearly\r\nall the village feasts, and its origin and nature will be matter for\r\ndiscussion in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nIn many places, even during the Middle Ages, and still more\r\nafterwards, the summer feast dropped out or degenerated. It became a\r\nmere beer-swilling, an ‘ale[606].’ And so we find in the sixteenth\r\ncentury a ‘king-ale[607]’ or a ‘Robin Hood’s ale[608],’ and in modern\r\ntimes a ‘Whitsun-ale[609],’ a ‘lamb-ale[610]’ or a ‘gyst-ale[611]’\r\nbeside the ‘church-ales’ and ‘scot-ales’ which the thirteenth-century\r\nbishops had already condemned[612]. On the other hand, the village\r\nfestival found its way to court, and became a sumptuous pageant under\r\nthe splendour-loving Tudors. For this, indeed, there was Arthurian\r\nprecedent in the romance of Malory, who records how Guenever was taken\r\nby Sir Meliagraunce, when ‘as the queen had mayed and all her knights,\r\nall were bedashed with herbs, mosses, and flowers, in the best manner\r\nand freshest[613].’ The chronicler Hall tells of the Mayings of Henry\r\nVIII in 1510, 1511, and 1515. In the last of these some hundred and\r\nthirty persons took part. Henry was entertained by Robin Hood and the\r\nrest with shooting-matches and a collation of venison in a bower; and\r\nreturning was met by a chariot in which rode the Lady May and the\r\nLady Flora, while on the five horses sat the Ladies Humidity, Vert,\r\nVegetave, Pleasaunce and Sweet Odour[614]. Obviously the pastime\r\nhas here degenerated in another direction. It has become learned,\r\nallegorical, and pseudo-classic. At the Reformation the May-game and\r\nthe May-pole were marks for Puritan onslaught. Latimer, in one of his\r\nsermons before Edward VI, complains how, when he had intended to preach\r\nin a certain country town on his way to London, he was told that he\r\ncould not be heard, for ‘it is Robyn hoodes daye. The parishe are gone\r\na brode to gather for Robyn hoode[615].’ Machyn’s _Diary_ mentions the\r\nbreaking of a May-pole in Fenchurch by the lord mayor of 1552[616],\r\nand the revival of elaborate and heterogeneous May-games throughout\r\nLondon during the brief span of Queen Mary[617]. The Elizabethan\r\nPuritans renewed the attack, but though something may have been done by\r\nreforming municipalities here and there to put down the festivals[618],\r\nthe ecclesiastical authorities could not be induced to go much beyond\r\nforbidding them to take place in churchyards[619]. William Stafford,\r\nindeed, declared in 1581 that ‘May-games, wakes, and revels’ were\r\n‘now laid down[620],’ but the violent abuse directed against them\r\nonly two years later by Philip Stubbes, which may be taken as a fair\r\nsample of the Puritan polemic as a whole, shows that this was far from\r\nbeing really the case[621]. In Scotland the Parliament ordered, as\r\nearly as 1555, that no one ‘be chosen Robert Hude, nor Lytill Johne,\r\nAbbot of vnressoun, Quenis of Maij, nor vtherwyse, nouther in Burgh\r\nnor to landwart in ony tyme to cum[622].’ But the prohibition was not\r\nvery effective, for in 1577 and 1578 the General Assembly is found\r\npetitioning for its renewal[623]. And in England no similar action was\r\ntaken until 1644 when the Long Parliament decreed the destruction of\r\nsuch May-poles as the municipalities had spared. Naturally this policy\r\nwas reversed at the Restoration, and a new London pole was erected in\r\nthe Strand, hard by Somerset House, which endured until 1717[624].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                            THE SWORD-DANCE\r\n\r\n    [_Bibliographical Note._--The books mentioned in the\r\n    bibliographical note to the last chapter should be consulted on\r\n    the general tendency to μίμησις in festival dance and song. The\r\n    symbolical dramatic ceremonies of the _renouveau_ are collected\r\n    by Dr. J. G. Frazer in _The Golden Bough_. The sword-dance has\r\n    been the subject of two elaborate studies: K. Müllenhoff, _Ueber\r\n    den Schwerttanz_, in _Festgaben für Gustav Homeyer_ (1871), iii,\r\n    with additions in _Zeitschrift für deutsches Alterthum_, xviii.\r\n    9, xx. 10; and F. A. Mayer, _Ein deutsches Schwerttanzspiel\r\n    aus Ungarn_ (with full bibliography), in _Zeitschrift für\r\n    Völkerpsychologie_ (1889), 204, 416. The best accounts of the\r\n    morris-dance are in F. Douce, _Illustrations of Shakespeare_\r\n    (1807, new ed. 1839), and A. Burton, _Rushbearing_ (1891), 95.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last two chapters have afforded more than one example of village\r\nfestival customs ultimately taking shape as drama. But neither the\r\nEnglish Robin Hood plays, nor the French _Jeu de Robin et Marion_, can\r\nbe regarded as folk-drama in the proper sense of the word. They were\r\nwritten not by the folk themselves, but by _trouvères_ or minstrels\r\n_for_ the folk; and at a period when the independent evolution of\r\nthe religious play had already set a model of dramatic composition.\r\nProbably the same is true of the Hox Tuesday play in the form in which\r\nwe may conjecture it to have been presented before Elizabeth late in\r\nthe sixteenth century. Nevertheless it is possible to trace, apart\r\nfrom minstrel intervention and apart from imitation of miracles, the\r\nexistence of certain embryonic dramatic tendencies in the village\r\nceremonies themselves. Too much must not be made of these. Jacob Grimm\r\nwas inclined to find in them the first vague beginnings of the whole of\r\nmodern drama[625]. This is demonstrably wrong. Modern drama arose, by\r\na fairly well defined line of evolution, from a threefold source, the\r\necclesiastical liturgy, the farce of the mimes, the classical revivals\r\nof humanism. Folk-drama contributed but the tiniest rill to the mighty\r\nstream. Such as it was, however, a couple of further chapters may be\r\nnot unprofitably spent in its analysis.\r\n\r\nThe festival customs include a number of dramatic rites which appear\r\nto have been originally symbolical expressions of the facts of\r\nseasonal recurrence lying at the root of the festivals themselves. The\r\nantithesis of winter and summer, the _renouveau_ of spring, are mimed\r\nin three or four distinct fashions. The first and the most important,\r\nas well as the most widespread of these, is the mock representation\r\nof a death or burial. Dr. Frazer has collected many instances of the\r\nceremony known as the ‘expulsion of Death[626].’ This takes place\r\nat various dates in spring and early summer, but most often on the\r\nfourth Sunday in Lent, one of the many names of which is consequently\r\n_Todten-Sonntag_. An effigy is made, generally of straw, but in some\r\ncases of birch twigs, a beechen bough, or other such material. This\r\nis called Death, is treated with marks of fear, hatred or contempt,\r\nand is finally carried in procession, and thrust over the boundary of\r\nthe village. Or it is torn in pieces, buried, burnt, or thrown into\r\na river or pool. Sometimes the health or other welfare of the folk\r\nduring the year is held to depend on the rite being duly performed. The\r\nfragments of Death have fertilizing efficacy for women and cattle; they\r\nare put in the fields, the mangers, the hens’ nests. Here and there\r\nwomen alone take part in the ceremony, but more often it is common to\r\nthe whole village. The expulsion of Death is found in various parts\r\nof Teutonic Germany, but especially in districts such as Thuringia,\r\nBohemia, Silesia, where the population is wholly or mainly Slavonic. A\r\nsimilar custom, known both in Slavonic districts and in Italy, France,\r\nand Spain, had the name of ‘sawing the old woman.’ At Florence, for\r\ninstance, the effigy of an old woman was placed on a ladder. At Mid\r\nLent it was sawn through, and the nuts and dried fruits with which it\r\nwas stuffed scrambled for by the crowd. At Palermo there was a still\r\nmore realistic representation with a real old woman, to whose neck a\r\nbladder of blood was fitted[627].\r\n\r\nThe ‘Death’ of the German and Slavonic form of the custom has clearly\r\ncome to be regarded as the personification of the forces of evil within\r\nthe village; and the ceremony of expulsion may be compared with other\r\nperiodical rites, European and non-European, in which evil spirits are\r\nsimilarly expelled[628]. The effigy may even be regarded in the light\r\nof a scapegoat, bearing away the sins of the community[629]. But it is\r\ndoubtful how far the notion of evil spirits warring against the good\r\nspirits which protect man and his crops is a European, or at any rate\r\na primitive European one[630]; and it may perhaps be taken for granted\r\nthat what was originally thought to be expelled in the rite was not so\r\nmuch either ‘Death’ or ‘Sin’ as winter. This view is confirmed by the\r\nevidence of an eighth-century homily, which speaks of the expulsion\r\nof winter in February as a relic of pagan belief[631]. Moreover, the\r\nexpulsion of Death is often found in the closest relation to the more\r\nwidespread custom of bringing summer, in the shape of green tree or\r\nbough, into the village. The procession which carries away the dead\r\neffigy brings back the summer tree; and the rhymes used treat the two\r\nevents as connected[632].\r\n\r\nThe homily just quoted suggests that the mock funeral or expulsion of\r\nwinter was no new thing in the eighth century. On the other hand, it\r\ncan hardly be supposed that customs which imply such abstract ideas\r\nas death, or even as summer and winter, belong to the earliest stages\r\nof the village festival. What has happened is what happens in other\r\nforms of festival play. The instinct of play, in this case finding\r\nvent in a dramatic representation of the succession of summer to\r\nwinter, has taken hold of and adapted to its own purposes elements\r\nin the celebrations which, once significant, have gradually come to\r\nbe mere traditional survivals. Such are the ceremonial burial in the\r\nground, the ceremonial burning, the ceremonial plunging into water,\r\nof the representative of the fertilization spirit. In particular,\r\nthe southern term ‘the old woman’ suggests that the effigy expelled\r\nor destroyed is none other than the ‘corn mother’ or ‘harvest-May,’\r\nfashioned to represent the fertilization spirit out of the last sheaf\r\nat harvest, and preserved until its place is taken by a new and green\r\nrepresentative in the spring.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, other versions of the mock death in which the\r\ncentral figure of the little drama is not the representative of the\r\nfertilization spirit itself, but one of the worshippers. In Bavaria\r\nthe Whitsuntide _Pfingstl_ is dressed in leaves and water-plants with\r\na cap of peonies. He is soused with water, and then, in mimicry,\r\nhas his head cut off. Similar customs prevail in the Erzgebirge and\r\nelsewhere[633]. We have seen this _Pfingstl_ before. He is the Jack in\r\nthe green, the worshipper clad in the god under whose protection he\r\ndesires to put himself[634]. But how can the killing of him symbolize\r\nthe spring, for obviously it is the coming summer, not the dying\r\nwinter, that the leaf-clad figure must represent? The fact is that the\r\nBavarian drama is not complete. The full ceremony is found in other\r\nparts of Germany. Thus in Saxony and Thuringia a ‘wild man’ covered\r\nwith leaves and moss is hunted in a wood, caught, and executed. Then\r\ncomes forward a lad dressed as a doctor, who brings the victim to life\r\nagain by bleeding[635]. Even so annually the summer dies and has its\r\nresurrection. In Swabia, again, on Shrove Tuesday, ‘Dr. Eisenbart’\r\nbleeds a man to death, and afterwards revives him. This same Dr.\r\nEisenbart appears also in the Swabian Whitsuntide execution, although\r\nhere too the actual resurrection seems to have dropped out of the\r\nceremony[636]. It is interesting to note that the green man of the\r\npeasantry, who dies and lives again, reappears as the Green Knight in\r\none of the most famous divisions of Arthurian romance[637].\r\n\r\nThe mock death or burial type of folk-drama resolves itself, then,\r\ninto two varieties. In one, it is winter whose passing is represented,\r\nand for this the discarded harvest-May serves as a nucleus. In the\r\nother, which is not really complete without a resurrection, it is\r\nsummer, whose death is mimed merely as a preliminary to its joyful\r\nrenewal; and this too is built up around a fragment of ancient cult\r\nin the person of the leaf-clad worshipper, who is, indeed, none other\r\nthan the priest-king, once actually, and still in some sort and show,\r\nslain at the festival[638]. In the instances so far dealt with, the\r\noriginal significance of the rite is still fairly traceable. But there\r\nare others into which new meanings, due to the influence of Christian\r\ncustom, have been read. In many parts of Germany customs closely\r\nanalogous to those of the expulsion of winter or Death take place\r\non Shrove Tuesday, and have suffered metamorphosis into ‘burial of\r\nthe Carnival[639].’ England affords the ‘Jack o’ Lent’ effigy which\r\nis taken to represent Judas Iscariot[640], the Lincoln ‘funeral of\r\nAlleluia[641],’ the Tenby ‘making Christ’s bed[642],’ the Monkton\r\n‘risin’ and buryin’ Peter[643].’ The truth that the vitality of a folk\r\ncustom is far greater than that of any single interpretation of it is\r\nadmirably illustrated.\r\n\r\nTwo other symbolical representations of the phenomena of the\r\n_renouveau_ must be very briefly treated. At Briançon in Dauphiné,\r\ninstead of a death and resurrection, is used a pretty little May-day\r\ndrama, in which the leaf-clad man falls into sleep upon the ground\r\nand is awakened by the kiss of a maiden[644]. Russia has a similar\r\ncustom; and such a magic kiss, bringing summer with it, lies at the\r\nheart of the story of the Sleeping Beauty. Indeed, the marriage of\r\nheaven and earth seems to have been a myth very early invented by the\r\nAryan mind to explain the fertility of crops beneath the rain, and\r\nit probably received dramatic form in religious ceremonies both in\r\nGreece and Italy[645]. Finally, there is a fairly widespread spring\r\ncustom of holding a dramatic fight between two parties, one clad in\r\ngreen to represent summer, the other in straw or fur to represent\r\nwinter. Waldron describes this in the Isle of Man[646]; Olaus Magnus\r\nin Sweden[647]. Grimm says that it is found in various districts on\r\nboth sides of the middle Rhine[648]. Perhaps both this dramatic battle\r\nand that of the Coventry Hox Tuesday owe their origin to the struggle\r\nfor the fertilizing head of a sacrificial animal, which also issued\r\nin football and similar games. Dr. Frazer quotes several instances\r\nfrom all parts of the world in which a mock fight, or an interchange\r\nof abuse and raillery taking the place of an actual fight, serves as\r\na crop-charm[649]. The summer and winter battle gave to literature a\r\nfamous type of neo-Latin and Romance _débat_[650]. In one of the most\r\ninteresting forms of this, the eighth-or ninth-century _Conflictus\r\nVeris et Hiemis_, the subject of dispute is the cuckoo, which spring\r\npraises and winter chides, while the shepherds declare that he must\r\nbe drowned or stolen away, because summer cometh not. The cuckoo is\r\neverywhere a characteristic bird of spring, and his coming was probably\r\na primitive signal for the high summer festival[651].\r\n\r\nThe symbolical dramas of the seasons stand alone and independent,\r\nbut it may safely be asserted that drama first arose at the village\r\nfeasts in close relation to the dance. That dancing, like all the\r\narts, tends to be mimetic is a fact which did not escape the attention\r\nof Aristotle[652]. The pantomimes of the decadent Roman stage are a\r\ncase in point. Greek tragedy itself had grown out of the Dionysiac\r\ndithyramb, and travellers describe how readily the dances of the\r\nmodern savage take shape as primitive dramas of war, hunting, love,\r\nreligion, labour, or domestic life[653]. Doubtless this was the case\r\nalso with the _caroles_ of the European festivals. The types of\r\n_chanson_ most immediately derived from these are full of dialogue, and\r\nalready on the point of bursting into drama. That they did do this,\r\nwith the aid of the minstrels, in the _Jeu de Robin et de Marion_\r\nwe have seen[654]. A curious passage in the _Itinerarium Cambriae_\r\nof Giraldus Cambrensis (†1188) describes a dance of peasants in and\r\nabout the church of St. Elined, near Brecknock on the Gwyl Awst, in\r\nwhich the ordinary operations of the village life, such as ploughing,\r\nsewing, spinning were mimetically represented[655]. Such dances seem\r\nto survive in some of the _rondes_ or ‘singing-games,’ so frequently\r\ndramatic, of children[656]. On the whole, perhaps, these connect\r\nthemselves rather with the domestic than with the strictly agricultural\r\nelement in village cult. A large proportion of them are concerned with\r\nmarriage. But the domestic and the agricultural cannot be altogether\r\ndissociated. The game of ‘Nuts in May,’ for instance, seems to have as\r\nits kernel a reminiscence of marriage by capture; but the ‘nuts’ or\r\nrather ‘knots’ or ‘posies’ ‘in May’ certainly suggest a setting at a\r\nseasonal festival. So too, with ‘Round the Mulberry Bush.’ The mimicry\r\nhere is of domestic operations, but the ‘bush’ recalls the sacred\r\ntree, the natural centre of the seasonal dances. The closest parallels\r\nto the dance described by Giraldus Cambrensis are to be found in the\r\n_rondes_ of ‘Oats and Beans and Barley’ and ‘Would you know how doth\r\nthe Peasant?’, in which the chief, though not always the only, subjects\r\nof mimicry are ploughing, sowing and the like, and which frequently\r\ncontain a prayer or aspiration for the welfare of the crops[657].\r\n\r\nI have treated the mimetic element of budding drama in the agricultural\r\nfestivals as being primarily a manifestation of the activities of play\r\ndetermined in its direction by the dominant interests of the occasion,\r\nand finding its material in the débris of ritual custom left over from\r\nforgotten stages of religious thought. It is possible also to hold\r\nthat the _mimesis_ is more closely interwoven with the religious and\r\npractical side of the festivals, and is in fact yet another example of\r\nthat primitive magical notion of causation by the production of the\r\nsimilar, which is at the root of the rain-and sun-charms. Certainly the\r\nvillage dramas, like the other ceremonies which they accompany, are\r\noften regarded as influencing the luck of the farmer’s year; just as\r\nthe hunting-and war-dances of savages are often regarded not merely as\r\namusement or as practice for actual war and hunting, but as charms to\r\nsecure success in these pursuits[658]. But it does not seem clear to me\r\nthat in this case the magical efficacy belongs to the drama from the\r\nbeginning, and I incline to look upon it as merely part of the sanctity\r\nof the feast as a whole, which has attached itself in the course of\r\ntime even to that side of it which began as play.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of folk-drama out of folk-dance may be most\r\ncompletely studied through a comparison of the various types of\r\nEuropean sword-dance with the so-called ‘mummers’,’ ‘guisers’,’ or\r\n‘Pace-eggers’’ play of Saint George. The history of the sword-dance\r\nhas received a good deal of attention from German archaeologists, who,\r\nhowever, perhaps from imperfect acquaintance with the English data,\r\nhave stopped short of the affiliation to it of the play[659]. The\r\ndance itself can boast a hoar antiquity. Tacitus describes it as the\r\none form of _spectaculum_ to be seen at the gatherings of the Germans\r\nwith whom he was conversant. The dancers were young men who leapt with\r\nmuch agility amongst menacing spear-points and sword-blades[660]. Some\r\ncenturies later the use of _sweorda-gelac_ as a metaphor for battle in\r\n_Beowulf_ shows that the term was known to the continental ancestors\r\nof the Anglo-Saxons[661]. Then follows a long gap in the record,\r\nbridged only by a doubtful reference in an eighth-century Frankish\r\nhomily[662], and a possible representation in a ninth-century Latin\r\nand Anglo-Saxon manuscript[663]. The minstrels seem to have adopted\r\nthe sword-dance into their repertory[664], but the earliest mediaeval\r\nnotice of it as a popular _ludus_ is at Nuremberg in 1350. From that\r\ndate onwards until quite recent years it crops up frequently, alike\r\nat Shrovetide, Christmas and other folk festivals, and as an element\r\nin the revels at weddings, royal entries, and the like[665]. It is\r\nfairly widespread throughout Germany. It is found in Italy, where it\r\nis called the _mattaccino_[666], and in Spain (_matachin_), and under\r\nthis name or that of the _danse des bouffons_ it was known both in\r\nFrance and England at the Renaissance[667]. It is given by Paradin\r\nin his _Le Blason des Danses_ and, with the music and cuts of the\r\nperformers, by Tabourot in his _Orchésographie_ (1588)[668]. These are\r\nthe sophisticated versions of courtly halls. But about the same date\r\nOlaus Magnus describes it as a folk-dance, to the accompaniment of\r\npipes or _cantilenae_, in Sweden[669]. In England, the main area of\r\nthe acknowledged sword-dance is in the north. It is found, according\r\nto Mr. Henderson, from the Humber to the Cheviots; and it extends as\r\nfar south as Cheshire and Nottinghamshire[670]. Outlying examples are\r\nrecorded from Winchester[671] and from Devonshire[672]. In Scotland Sir\r\nWalter Scott found it among the farthest Hebrides, and it has also been\r\ntraced in Fifeshire[673].\r\n\r\nThe name of _danse des bouffons_ sometimes given to the sword-dance\r\nmay be explained by a very constant feature of the English examples,\r\nin which the dancers generally include or are accompanied by one or\r\nmore comic or grotesque personages. The types of these grotesques are\r\nnot kept very distinct in the descriptions, or, probably, in fact. But\r\nthey appear to be fundamentally two. There is the ‘Tommy’ or ‘fool,’\r\nwho wears the skin and tail of a fox or some other animal, and there is\r\nthe ‘Bessy,’ who is a man dressed in a woman’s clothes. And they can be\r\nparalleled from outside England. A _Narr_ or _Fasching_ (carnival fool)\r\nis a figure in several German sword-dances, and in one from Bohemia he\r\nhas his female counterpart in a _Mehlweib_[674].\r\n\r\nWith the _cantilenae_ noticed by Olaus Magnus may be compared the sets\r\nof verses with which several modern sword-dances, both in these islands\r\nand in Germany, are provided. They are sung before or during part of\r\nthe dances, and as a rule are little more than an introduction of\r\nthe performers, to whom they give distinctive names. If they contain\r\nany incident, it is generally of the nature of a quarrel, in which\r\none of the dancers or one of the grotesques is killed. To this point\r\nit will be necessary to return. The names given to the characters\r\nare sometimes extremely nondescript; sometimes, under a more or less\r\nliterary influence, of an heroic order. Here and there a touch of\r\nsomething more primitive may be detected. Five sets of verses from\r\nthe north of England are available in print. Two of these are of\r\nDurham _provenance_. One, from Houghton-le-Spring, has, besides the\r\nskin-clad ‘Tommy’ and the ‘Bessy,’ five dancers. These are King George,\r\na Squire’s Son also called Alick or Alex, a King of Sicily, Little\r\nFoxey, and a Pitman[675]. The other Durham version has a captain called\r\nTrue Blue, a Squire’s Son, Mr. Snip a tailor, a Prodigal Son (replaced\r\nin later years by a Sailor), a Skipper, a Jolly Dog. There is only\r\none clown, who calls himself a ‘fool,’ and acts as treasurer. He is\r\nnamed Bessy, but wears a hairy cap with a fox’s brush pendent[676].\r\nTwo other versions come from Yorkshire. At Wharfdale there are seven\r\ndancers, Thomas the clown, his son Tom, Captain Brown, Obadiah Trim a\r\ntailor, a Foppish Knight, Love-ale a vintner, and Bridget the clown’s\r\nwife[677]. At Linton in Craven there are five, the clown, Nelson, Jack\r\nTar, Tosspot, and Miser a woman[678]. The fifth version is of unnamed\r\nlocality. It has two clowns, Tommy in skin and tail, and Bessy, and\r\namongst the dancers are a Squire’s Son and a Tailor[679]. Such a\r\nnomenclature will not repay much analysis. The ‘Squire,’ whose son\r\nfigures amongst the dancers, is identical with the ‘Tommy,’ although\r\nwhy he should have a son I do not know. Similarly, the ‘Bridget’ at\r\nWharfdale and the ‘Miser’ at Linton correspond to the ‘Bessy’ who\r\nappears elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe Shetland dance, so far as the names go, is far more literary\r\nand less of a folk affair than any of the English examples. The\r\ngrotesques are absent altogether, and the dancers belong wholly to\r\nthat heroic category which is also represented in a degenerate form\r\nat Houghton-le-Spring. They are in fact those ‘seven champions of\r\nChristendom’--St. George of England, St. James of Spain, St. Denys of\r\nFrance, St. David of Wales, St. Patrick of Ireland, St. Anthony of\r\nItaly, and St. Andrew of Scotland--whose legends were first brought\r\ntogether under that designation by Richard Johnson in 1596[680].\r\n\r\nPrecisely the same divergence between a popular and a literary or\r\nheroic type of nomenclature presents itself in such of the German\r\nsword-dance rhymes as are in print. Three very similar versions\r\nfrom Styria, Hungary, and Bohemia are traceable to a common\r\n‘Austro-Bavarian’ archetype[681]. The names of these, so far as they\r\nare intelligible at all, appear to be due to the village imagination,\r\nworking perhaps in one or two instances, such as ‘Grünwald’ or ‘Wilder\r\nWaldmann,’ upon stock figures of the folk festivals[682]. It is the\r\nheroic element, however, which predominates in the two other sets of\r\nverses which are available. One is from the Clausthal in the Harz\r\nmountains, and here the dancers represent the five kings of England,\r\nSaxony, Poland, Denmark, and Moorland, together with a serving-man,\r\nHans, and one Schnortison, who acts as leader and treasurer of the\r\nparty[683]. In the other, from Lübeck, the dancers are the ‘worthies’\r\nKaiser Karl, Josua, Hector, David, Alexander, and Judas Maccabaeus.\r\nThey fight with one Sterkader, in whom Müllenhoff finds the Danish hero\r\nStercatherus mentioned by Saxo Grammaticus; and to the Hans of the\r\nClausthal corresponds a Klas Rugebart, who seems to be the red-bearded\r\nSt. Nicholas[684].\r\n\r\nIn view of the wide range of the sword-dance in Germany, I do not think\r\nit is necessary to attach any importance to the theories advanced by\r\nSir Walter Scott and others that it is, in England and Scotland, of\r\nScandinavian origin. It is true that it appears to be found mainly\r\nin those parts of these islands where the influence of Danes and\r\nNorthmen may be conjectured to have been strongest. But I believe that\r\nthis is a matter of appearance merely, and that a type of folk-dance\r\nfar more widely spread in the south of England than the sword-dance\r\nproper, is really identical with it. This is the morris-dance, the\r\nchief characteristic of which is that the performers wear bells which\r\njingle at every step. Judging by the evidence of account-books, as\r\nwell as by the allusions of contemporary writers, the morris was\r\nremarkably popular in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries[685].\r\nFrequently, but by no means always, it is mentioned in company with the\r\nMay-game[686]. In a certain painted window at Betley in Staffordshire\r\nare represented six morris-dancers, together with a May-pole, a\r\nmusician, a fool, a crowned man on a hobby-horse, a crowned lady\r\nwith a pink in her hand, and a friar. The last three may reasonably\r\nbe regarded as Robin Hood, Maid Marian, and Friar Tuck[687]. The\r\ncloseness of the relation between the morris-dance and the May-game\r\nis, however, often exaggerated. The Betley figures only accompany\r\nthe morris-dance; they do not themselves wear the bells. And besides\r\nthe window, the only trace of evidence that any member of the Robin\r\nHood _cortège_, with the exception of Maid Marian, was essential to\r\nthe morris-dance, is a passage in a masque of Ben Jonson’s, which so\r\nseems to regard the friar[688]. The fact is that the morris-dance was\r\na great deal older, as an element in the May-game, than Robin Hood,\r\nand that when Robin Hood’s name was forgotten in this connexion, the\r\nmorris-dance continued to be in vogue, not at May-games only, but at\r\nevery form of rustic merry-making. On the other hand, it is true that\r\nthe actual dancers were generally accompanied by grotesque personages,\r\nand that one of these was a woman, or a man dressed in woman’s clothes,\r\nto whom literary writers at least continued to give the name of Maid\r\nMarian. The others have nothing whatever to do with Robin Hood. They\r\nwere a clown or fool, and a hobby-horse, who, if the evidence of an\r\nElizabethan song can be trusted, was already beginning to go out of\r\nfashion[689]. A rarer feature was a dragon, and it is possible that,\r\nwhen there was a dragon, the rider of the hobby-horse was supposed to\r\npersonate St. George[690]. The morris-dance is by no means extinct,\r\nespecially in the north and midlands. Accounts of it are available\r\nfrom Lancashire and Cheshire[691], Derbyshire[692], Shropshire[693],\r\nLeicestershire[694], and Oxfordshire[695]; and there are many other\r\ncounties in which it makes, or has recently made, an appearance[696].\r\nThe hobby-horse, it would seem, is now at last, except in Derbyshire,\r\nfinally ‘forgot’; but the two other traditional grotesques are still\r\n_de rigueur_. Few morris-dances are complete without the ‘fool’ or\r\nclown, amongst whose various names that of ‘squire’ in Oxfordshire and\r\nthat of ‘dirty Bet’ in Lancashire are the most interesting. The woman\r\nis less invariable. Her Tudor name of Maid Marian is preserved in\r\nLeicestershire alone; elsewhere she appears as a shepherdess, or Eve,\r\nor ‘the fool’s wife’; and sometimes she is merged with the ‘fool’ into\r\na single nondescript personage.\r\n\r\nThe morris-dance is by no means confined to England. There are\r\nrecords of it from Scotland[697], Germany[698], Flanders[699],\r\nSwitzerland[700], Italy[701], Spain[702], and France[703]. In the\r\nlast-named country Tabourot described it about 1588 under the name of\r\n_morisque_[704], and the earlier English writers call it the _morisce_,\r\n_morisk_, or _morisco_[705]. This seems to imply a derivation of the\r\nname at least from the Spanish _morisco_, a Moor. The dance itself\r\nhas consequently been held to be of Moorish origin, and the habit\r\nof blackening the face has been considered as a proof of this[706].\r\nSuch a theory seems to invert the order of facts. The dance is too\r\nclosely bound up with English village custom to be lightly regarded\r\nas a foreign importation; and I would suggest that the faces were\r\nnot blackened, because the dancers represented Moors, but rather the\r\ndancers were thought to represent Moors, because their faces were\r\nblackened. The blackened face is common enough in the village festival.\r\nHence, as we have seen, May-day became proper to the chimney-sweeps,\r\nand we have found a conjectural reason for the disguise in the\r\nprimitive custom of smearing the face with the beneficent ashes of\r\nthe festival fire[707]. Blackened faces are known in the sword-dance\r\nas well as in the morris-dance[708]; and there are other reasons\r\nwhich make it probable that the two are only variants of the same\r\nperformance. Tabourot, it is true, distinguishes _les bouffons_, or\r\nthe sword-dance, and _le morisque_; but then Tabourot is dealing\r\nwith the sophisticated versions of the folk-dances used in society,\r\nand Cotgrave, translating _les buffons_, can find no better English\r\nterm than _morris_ for the purpose[709]. The two dances appear at\r\nthe same festivals, and they have the same grotesques; for the Tommy\r\nand Bessy of the English sword-dance, who occasionally merge in one,\r\nare obviously identical with the Maid Marian and the ‘fool’ of the\r\nmorris-dance, who also nowadays similarly coalesce. There are traces,\r\ntoo, of an association of the hobby-horse with the sword-dance, as well\r\nas with the morris-dance[710]. Most conclusive of all, however, is the\r\nfact that in Oxfordshire and in Shropshire the morris-dancers still\r\nuse swords or wooden staves which obviously represent swords, and that\r\nthe performers of the elaborate Revesby sword-dance or play, to be\r\nhereafter described, are called in the eighteenth-century manuscript\r\n‘morrice dancers[711].’ I do not think that the floating handkerchiefs\r\nof the morris-dance are found in its congener, nor do I know what,\r\nif any, significance they have. Probably, like the ribbons, they\r\nmerely represent rustic notions of ornament. Müllenhoff lays stress\r\non the white shirts or smocks which he finds almost universal in the\r\nsword-dance[712]. The morris-dancers are often described as dressed in\r\nwhite; but here too, if the ordinary work-a-day costume is a smock,\r\nthe festal costume is naturally a clean white smock. Finally, there\r\nare the bells. These, though they have partially disappeared in the\r\nnorth, seem to be proper to the morris-dance, and to differentiate\r\nit from the sword-dance[713]. But this is only so when the English\r\nexamples are alone taken into consideration, for Müllenhoff quotes\r\none Spanish and three German descriptions of sword-dances in which\r\nthe bells are a feature[714]. Tabourot affords similar evidence for\r\nthe French version[715]; while Olaus Magnus supplements his account\r\nof the Scandinavian sword-dance with one of a similar performance, in\r\nwhich the swords were replaced by bows, and bells were added[716]. The\r\nobject of the bells was probably to increase or preserve the musical\r\neffect of the clashing swords. The performers known to Tacitus were\r\n_nudi_, and no bells are mentioned. One other point with regard to\r\nthe morris-dance is worth noticing before we leave the subject. It\r\nis capable of use both as a stationary and a processional dance, and\r\ntherefore illustrates both of the two types of dancing motion naturally\r\nevolved from the circumstances of the village festival[717].\r\n\r\nMüllenhoff regards the sword-dance as primarily a rhythmic _Abbild_ or\r\nmimic representation of war, subsequently modified in character by use\r\nat the village feasts[718]. It is true that the notice of Tacitus and\r\nthe allusion in _Beowulf_ suggest that it had a military character; and\r\nit may fairly be inferred that it formed part of that war-cult from\r\nwhich, as pointed out in a previous chapter, heroic poetry sprang. This\r\nis confirmed by the fact that some at least of the _dramatis personae_\r\nof the modern dances belong to the heroic category. Side by side with\r\nlocal types such as the Pitman or the Sailor, and with doublets of\r\nthe grotesques such as Little Foxey or the Squire’s Son[719], appear\r\nthe five kings of the Clausthal dance, the ‘worthies’ of the Lübeck\r\ndance, and the ‘champions of Christendom’ of the Shetland dance.\r\nThese particular groups betray a Renaissance rather than a mediaeval\r\nimagination; as with the morris-dance of _The Two Noble Kinsmen_,\r\nthe village schoolmaster, Holophernes or another, has probably been\r\nat work upon them[720]. Some of the heterogeneous English _dramatis\r\npersonae_, Nelson for instance, testify to a still later origin. On the\r\nother hand, the Sterkader or Stercatherus of the Lübeck dance suggests\r\nthat genuine national heroes were occasionally celebrated in this\r\nfashion. At the same time I do not believe, with Müllenhoff, that the\r\nsword-dance originated in the war-cult. Its essentially agricultural\r\ncharacter seems to be shown by the grotesques traditionally associated\r\nwith it, the man in woman’s clothes, the skin or tail-wearing clown and\r\nthe hobby-horse, all of which seem to find their natural explanation\r\nin the facts of agricultural worship[721]. Again, the dance makes its\r\nappearance, not like heroic poetry in general as part of the minstrel\r\nrepertory, but as a purely popular thing at the agricultural festivals.\r\nTo these festivals, therefore, we may reasonably suppose it to have\r\noriginally belonged, and to have been borrowed from them by the young\r\nwarriors who danced before the king. They, however, perhaps gave it the\r\nheroic element which, in its turn, drifted into the popular versions.\r\nWe have already seen that popular heroic _cantilenae_ existed together\r\nwith those of minstrelsy up to a late date. Nor does Müllenhoff’s view\r\nfind much support from the classical sword-dances which he adduces. As\r\nto the origin of the _lusus Troiae_ or Pyrrhic dance which the Romans\r\nadopted from Doric Greece, I can say nothing[722]; but the native\r\nItalian dance of the _Salii_ or priests of Mars in March and October is\r\nclearly agricultural. It belongs to the cult of Mars, not as war-god,\r\nbut in his more primitive quality of a fertilization spirit[723].\r\n\r\nFurther, I believe that the use of swords in the dance was not\r\nmartial at all; their object was to suggest not a fight, but a mock\r\nor symbolical sacrifice. Several of the dances include figures in\r\nwhich the swords are brought together in a significant manner about\r\nthe person of one or more of the dancers. Thus in the Scandinavian\r\ndance described by Olaus Magnus, a _quadrata rosa_ of swords is placed\r\non the head of each performer. A precisely similar figure occurs in\r\nthe Shetland and in a variety of the Yorkshire dances[724]. In the\r\nSiebenbürgen dances there are two figures in which the performers\r\npretend to cut at each other’s heads or feet, and a third in which one\r\nof them has the swords put in a ring round his neck[725]. This latter\r\nevolution occurs also in a variety of the Yorkshire dance[726] and in\r\na Spanish one described by Müllenhoff after a seventeenth-century\r\nwriter. And here the figure has the significant name of _la degollada_,\r\n‘the beheading[727].’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                           THE MUMMERS’ PLAY\r\n\r\n    [_Bibliographical Note._--The subject is treated by T.

(Fragment, from ‘old MS.’)]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _degollada_ figures of certain sword-dances preserve with some\r\nclearness the memory of an actual sacrifice, abolished and replaced\r\nby a mere symbolic dumb show. Even in these, and still more in\r\nthe other dances, the symbolism is very slight. It is completely\r\nsubordinated to the rhythmic evolutions of a choric figure. There is\r\nan advance, however, in the direction of drama, when in the course\r\nof the performance some one is represented as actually slain. In a\r\nfew dances of the type discussed in the last chapter, such a dramatic\r\nepisode precedes or follows the regular figures. It is recorded in\r\nthree or four of the German examples[728]. A writer in the _Gentleman’s\r\nMagazine_ describes a Yorkshire dance in which ‘the Bessy interferes\r\nwhile they are making a hexagon with their swords, and is killed.’\r\nAmongst the characters of this dance is a Doctor, and although the\r\nwriter does not say so, it may be inferred that the function of the\r\nDoctor is to bring the Bessy to life again[729]. It will be remembered\r\nthat a precisely similar device is used in the German Shrove Tuesday\r\nplays to symbolize the resurrection of the year in spring after its\r\ndeath in winter. The Doctor reappears in one of the Durham dances, and\r\nhere there is no doubt as to the part he plays. At a certain point the\r\ncareful formations of the dance degenerate into a fight. The parish\r\nclergyman rushes in to separate the combatants. He is accidentally\r\nslain. There is general lamentation, but the Doctor comes forward, and\r\nrevives the victim, and the dance proceeds[730].\r\n\r\nIt is but a step from such dramatic episodes to the more elaborate\r\nperformances which remain to be considered in the present chapter, and\r\nwhich are properly to be called plays rather than dances. They belong\r\nto a stage in the evolution of drama from dance, in which the dance\r\nhas been driven into the background and has sometimes disappeared\r\naltogether. But they have the same characters, and especially the same\r\ngrotesques, as the dances, and the general continuity of the two sets\r\nof performances cannot be doubted. Moreover, though the plays differ\r\nin many respects, they have a common incident, which may reasonably be\r\ntaken to be the central incident, in the death and revival, generally\r\nby a Doctor, of one of the characters. And in virtue of this central\r\nincident one is justified in classing them as forms of a folk-drama in\r\nwhich the resurrection of the year is symbolized.\r\n\r\nI take first, on account of the large amount of dancing which remains\r\nin it, the play acted at the end of the eighteenth century by ‘The Plow\r\nBoys or Morris Dancers’ of Revesby in Lincolnshire[731]. There are\r\nseven dancers: six men, the Fool and his five sons, Pickle Herring,\r\nBlue Breeches, Pepper Breeches, Ginger Breeches, and Mr. Allspice[732];\r\nand one woman, Cicely. The somewhat incoherent incidents are as\r\nfollows. The Fool acts as presenter and introduces the play. He fights\r\nsuccessively a Hobby-horse and a ‘Wild Worm’ or dragon. The dancers\r\n‘lock their swords to make the glass,’ which, after some jesting, is\r\nbroken up again. The sons determine to kill the Fool. He kneels down\r\nand makes his will, with the swords round his neck[733]; is slain and\r\nrevived by Pickle Herring stamping with his foot. This is repeated with\r\nvariations. Hitherto, the dancers have ‘footed it’ round the room at\r\nintervals. Now follow a series of sword-dances. During and after these\r\nthe Fool and his sons in turn woo Cicely, the Fool taking the name of\r\n‘Anthony[734],’ Pickle Herring that of ‘the Lord of Pool,’ and Blue\r\nBreeches that of ‘the Knight of Lee.’ There is nothing particularly\r\ninteresting about this part of the play, obviously written to ‘work in’\r\nthe woman grotesque. In the course of it a morris-dance is introduced,\r\nand a final sword-dance, with an obeisance to the master of the house,\r\nwinds up the whole.\r\n\r\nSecondly, there are the Plough Monday plays of the east Midlands[735].\r\nThese appear in Nottinghamshire, Northamptonshire and Lincolnshire.\r\nTwo printed versions are available. The first comes from Cropwell in\r\nNottinghamshire[736]. The actors are ‘the plough-bullocks.’ The male\r\ncharacters are Tom the Fool, a Recruiting Sergeant, and a Ribboner or\r\nRecruit, three farm-servants, Threshing Blade, Hopper Joe[737], and the\r\nPloughman, a Doctor, and Beelzebub[738]. There are two women, a young\r\nLady and old Dame Jane. Tom Fool is presenter. The Ribboner, rejected\r\nby the young Lady, enlists as a recruit. The Lady is consoled by Tom\r\nFool. Then enter successively the three farm-servants, each describing\r\nhis function on the farm. Dame Jane tries to father a child on Tom\r\nFool. Beelzebub knocks her down[739], and kills her. The Doctor comes\r\nin, and after some comic business about his travels, his qualifications\r\nand his remedies[740], declares Dame Jane to be only in a trance, and\r\nraises her up. A country dance and songs follow, and the performance\r\nends with a _quête_. The second version, from Lincolnshire, is very\r\nsimilar[741]. But there are no farm-servants, and instead of Beelzebub\r\nis a personage called ‘old Esem Esquesem,’ who carries a broom. It is\r\nhe, not an old woman, who is killed and brought to life. There are\r\nseveral dancers, besides the performers; and these include ‘Bessy,’ a\r\nman dressed as a woman, with a cow’s tail.\r\n\r\nThe distinction between a popular and a literary or heroic type of\r\npersonification which was noticeable in the sword-dances persists in\r\nthe folk-plays founded upon them. Both in the Revesby play and in the\r\nPlough Monday plays, the drama is carried on by personages resembling\r\nthe ‘grotesques’ of the sword-and morris-dances[742]. There are no\r\nheroic characters. The death is of the nature of an accident or an\r\nexecution. On the other hand, in the ‘mummers’ play’ of St. George, the\r\nheroes take once more the leading part, and the death, or at least one\r\nof the deaths, is caused by a fight amongst them. This play is far more\r\nwidely spread than its rivals. It is found in all parts of England, in\r\nWales, and in Ireland; in Scotland it occurs also, but here some other\r\nhero is generally substituted as protagonist for St. George[743]. The\r\nfollowing account is based on the twenty-nine versions, drawn from\r\nchap-books or from oral tradition, enumerated in the bibliographical\r\nnote. The list might, doubtless, be almost indefinitely extended. As\r\nwill soon be seen, the local variations of the play are numerous. In\r\norder to make them intelligible, I have given in full in an appendix\r\na version from Lutterworth in Leicestershire. This is chosen, not as\r\na particularly interesting variant, for that it is not, but on the\r\ncontrary as being comparatively colourless. It shows very clearly and\r\nbriefly the normal structure of the play, and may be regarded as the\r\ntype from which the other versions diverge[744].\r\n\r\nThe whole performance may be divided, for convenience of analysis,\r\ninto three parts, the Presentation, the Drama, the _Quête_. In\r\nthe first somebody speaks a prologue, claiming a welcome from\r\nthe spectators[745], and then the leading characters are in turn\r\nintroduced. The second consists of a fight followed by the intervention\r\nof a doctor to revive the slain. In the third some supernumerary\r\ncharacters enter, and there is a collection. It is the dramatic\r\nnucleus that first requires consideration. The leading fighter is\r\ngenerally St. George, who alone appears in all the versions. Instead\r\nof ‘St. George,’ he is sometimes called ‘Sir George,’ and more\r\noften ‘Prince George’ or ‘King George,’ modifications which one\r\nmay reasonably suppose to be no older than the present Hanoverian\r\ndynasty. At Whitehaven and at Falkirk he is ‘Prince George of Ville.’\r\nGeorge’s chief opponent is usually one of two personages, who are not\r\nabsolutely distinct from each other[746]. One is the ‘Turkish Knight,’\r\nof whom a variant appears to be the ‘Prince of Paradine’ (Manchester),\r\nor ‘Paradise’ (Newport, Eccleshall), perhaps originally ‘Palestine.’\r\nHe is sometimes represented with a blackened face[747]. The other is\r\nvariously called ‘Slasher,’ ‘Captain Slasher,’ ‘Bold Slasher,’ or,\r\nby an obvious corruption, ‘Beau Slasher.’ Rarer names for him are\r\n‘Bold Slaughterer’ (Bampton), ‘Captain Bluster’ (Dorset [A]), and\r\n‘Swiff, Swash, and Swagger’ (Chiswick). His names fairly express his\r\nvaunting disposition, which, however, is largely shared by the other\r\ncharacters in the play. In the place of, or as minor fighters by the\r\nside of George, the Turkish Knight and Bold Slasher, there appear,\r\nin one version or another, a bewildering variety of personages, of\r\nwhom only a rough classification can be attempted. Some belong to the\r\nheroic cycles. Such are ‘Alexander’ (Newcastle, Whitehaven), ‘Hector’\r\n(Manchester), ‘St. Guy’ (Newport), ‘St. Giles’ (Eccleshall)[748], ‘St.\r\nPatrick’ (Dorset [A], Wexford), ‘King Alfred’ and ‘King Cole’ (Brill),\r\n‘Giant Blunderbore’ (Brill), ‘Giant Turpin’ (Cornwall). Others again\r\nare moderns who have caught the popular imagination: ‘Bold Bonaparte’\r\n(Leigh)[749], and ‘King of Prussia’ (Bampton, Oxford)[750], ‘King\r\nWilliam’ (Brill), the ‘Duke of Cumberland’ (Oxford) and the ‘Duke of\r\nNorthumberland’ (Islip), ‘Lord Nelson’ (Stoke Gabriel, Devon)[751],\r\n‘Wolfe’ and ‘Wellington’ (Cornwall)[752], even the ‘Prince Imperial’\r\n(Wilts)[753], all have been pressed into the service. In some cases\r\ncharacters have lost their personal names, if they ever had any,\r\nand figure merely as ‘Knight,’ ‘Soldier,’ ‘Valiant Soldier,’ ‘Noble\r\nCaptain,’ ‘Bold Prince,’ ‘Gracious King.’ Others bear names which defy\r\nexplanation, ‘Alonso’ (Chiswick), ‘Hy Gwyer’ (Hollington), ‘Marshalee’\r\nand ‘Cutting Star’ (Dorset [B]). The significance of ‘General\r\nValentine’ and ‘Colonel Spring’ (Dorset [A]) will be considered\r\npresently; and ‘Room’ (Dorset [B]), ‘Little Jack,’ the ‘Bride’ and\r\nthe ‘Fool’ (Brill), and the ‘King of Egypt’ (Newcastle, Whitehaven)\r\nhave strayed in amongst the fighters from the presenters. The fighting\r\ngenerally takes the form of a duel, or a succession of duels. In the\r\nlatter case, George may fight all comers, or he may intervene to subdue\r\na previously successful champion. But an important point is that he\r\nis not always victorious. On the contrary, the versions in which he\r\nslays and those in which he is slain are about equal in number. In two\r\nversions (Brill, Steyning) the fighting is not a duel or a series of\r\nduels, but a _mêlée_. The Brill play, in particular, is quite unlike\r\nthe usual type. A prominent part is taken by the Dragon, with whom\r\nfight, all at once, St. George and a heterogeneous company made up of\r\nKing Alfred and his Bride, King Cole, King William, Giant Blunderbore,\r\nLittle Jack and a morris-dance Fool.\r\n\r\nWhatever the nature of the fight, the result is always the same. One or\r\nmore of the champions falls, and then appears upon the scene a Doctor,\r\nwho brings the dead to life again. The Doctor is a comic character. He\r\nenters, boasting his universal skill, and works his cure by exhibiting\r\na bolus, or by drawing out a tooth with a mighty pair of pliers. At\r\nNewbold he is ‘Dr. Brown,’ at Islip ‘Dr. Good’ (also called ‘Jack\r\nSpinney’), at Brill ‘Dr. Ball’; in Dorsetshire (A) he is an Irishman,\r\n‘Mr. Martin’ (perhaps originally ‘Martyr’) ‘Dennis.’ More often he is\r\nnameless. Frequently the revival scene is duplicated; either the Doctor\r\nis called in twice, or one cure is left to him, and another is effected\r\nby some other performer, such as St. George (Dorset [B]), ‘Father\r\nChristmas’ (Newbold, Steyning), or the Fool (Bampton).\r\n\r\nThe central action of the play consists, then, in these two episodes\r\nof the fight and the resurrection; and the protagonists, so to speak,\r\nare the heroes--a ragged troop of heroes, certainly--and the Doctor.\r\nBut just as in the sword-dances, so in the plays, we find introduced,\r\nbesides the protagonists, a number of supernumerary figures. The nature\r\nof these, and the part they take, must now be considered. Some of them\r\nare by this time familiar. They are none other than the grotesques\r\nthat have haunted this discussion of the village festivals from the\r\nvery beginning, and that I have attempted to trace to their origin in\r\nmagical or sacrificial custom. There are the woman, or lad dressed in\r\nwoman’s clothes, the hobby-horse, the fool, and the black-faced man.\r\nThe woman and the hobby-horse are unmistakable; the other two are a\r\nlittle more Protean in their modern appearance. The ‘Fool’ is so called\r\nonly at Manchester and at Brill, where he brings his morris-dance with\r\nhim. At Lutterworth he is the ‘Clown’; in Cornwall, ‘Old Squire’; at\r\nNewbold, ‘Big Head and Little Wits.’ But I think that we may also\r\nrecognize him in the very commonly occurring figure ‘Beelzebub,’ also\r\nknown in Cornwall as ‘Hub Bub’ and at Chiswick as ‘Lord Grubb.’ The\r\nkey to this identification is the fact that in several cases Beelzebub\r\nuses the description ‘big head and little wit’ to announce himself on\r\nhis arrival. Occasionally, however, the personality of the Fool has\r\nbeen duplicated. At Lutterworth Beelzebub and the Clown, at Newbold\r\nBeelzebub and Big Head and Little Wits appear in the same play[754].\r\nThe black-faced man has in some cases lost his black face, but he\r\nkeeps it at Bampton, where he is ‘Tom the Tinker,’ at Rugby, where he\r\nis ‘Little Johnny Sweep,’ and in a Sussex version, where he is also a\r\nsweep[755]. The analogy of the May-day chimney-sweeps is an obvious\r\none. A black face was a feature in the mediaeval representation of\r\ndevils, and the sweep of some plays is probably in origin identical\r\nwith the devil, black-faced or not, of others. This is all the more\r\nso, as the devil, like the sweep, usually carries a besom[756]. One\r\nwould expect _his_ name, and not the Fool’s, to be Beelzebub. He is,\r\nhowever, ‘Little Devil Dout’ or ‘Doubt,’ ‘Little Jack Doubt’ or ‘Jack\r\nDevil Doubt.’ At Leigh Little Devil Doubt also calls himself ‘Jack,’\r\n\r\n    ‘With my wife and family on my back’;\r\n\r\nand perhaps we may therefore trace a further avatar of this same\r\npersonage in the ‘John’ or ‘Johnny Jack’ who at Salisbury gives a name\r\nto the whole performance[757]. He is also ‘Little Jack’ (Brill, St.\r\nMary Bourne), ‘Fat Jack’ (Islip), ‘Happy Jack’ (Berkshire, Hollington),\r\n‘Humpty Jack’ (Newbold). He generally makes the remark about his wife\r\nand family. What he does carry upon his back is sometimes a hump,\r\nsometimes a number of rag-dolls. I take it that the hump came first,\r\nand that the dolls arose out of Jack’s jocular explanation of his own\r\ndeformity. But why the hump? Was it originally a bag of soot? Or the\r\n_saccus_ with which the German _Knechte Ruperte_ wander in the Twelve\r\nnights?[758] At Hollington and in a Hampshire version Jack has been\r\nsomewhat incongruously turned into a press-gang. In this capacity he\r\ngets at Hollington the additional name of ‘Tommy Twing-twang.’\r\n\r\nHaving got these grotesques, traditional accompaniments of the play, to\r\ndispose of somehow, what do the playwrights do with them? The simplest\r\nand most primitive method is just to bring them in, to show them to the\r\nspectators when the fighting is over. Thus Beelzebub, like the Fool at\r\none point in the Revesby play, often comes in with\r\n\r\n    ‘Here come I; ain’t been yit,\r\n    Big head and little wit.’\r\n\r\n‘Ain’t been yit!’ Could a more naïve explanation of the presence of a\r\n‘stock’ character on the stage be imagined? Similarly in Cornwall the\r\nwoman is worked in by making ‘Sabra,’ a _persona muta_, come forward\r\nto join St. George[759]. In the play printed in _Sharpe’s London\r\nMagazine_ the ‘Hobby-horse’ is led in. Obviously personages other than\r\nthe traditional four can be introduced in the same way, at the bidding\r\nof the rustic fancy. Thus at Bampton ‘Robin Hood’ and ‘Little John’\r\nbriefly appear, in both the Irish plays and at Tenby ‘Oliver Cromwell,’\r\nat Belfast ‘St. Patrick,’ at Steyning the ‘Prince of Peace.’\r\n\r\nSecondly, the supernumeraries may be utilized, either as presenters of\r\nthe main characters or for the purposes of the _quête_ at the end. Thus\r\nat Leigh the performance is begun by Little Devil Doubt, who enters\r\nwith his broom and sweeps a ‘room’ or ‘hall’ for the actors, just as\r\nin the sword-dances a preliminary circle is made with a sword upon the\r\nground[760]. In the Midlands this is the task of the woman, called at\r\nIslip and in Berkshire ‘Molly,’ and at Bright-Walton ‘Queen Mary[761].’\r\nElsewhere the business with the broom is omitted; but there is nearly\r\nalways a short prologue in which an appeal is made to the spectators\r\nfor ‘room.’ This prologue may be spoken, as at Manchester by the Fool,\r\nor as at Lutterworth by one of the fighters. The commonest presenter,\r\nhowever, is a personification of the festal season at which the plays\r\nare usually performed, ‘Old Father Christmas.’\r\n\r\n    ‘Here comes I, Father Christmas, welcome or welcome not,\r\n    I hope Old Father Christmas will never be forgot.’\r\n\r\nAt St. Mary Bourne Christmas is accompanied by ‘Mince-Pie,’ and\r\nin both the Dorset versions, instead of calling for ‘room,’ he\r\nintroduces ‘Room’ as an actual personage. Similarly, at Newport and\r\nEccleshall, the prologue speaker receives the curious soubriquet of\r\n‘Open-the-Door.’ After the prologue, the fighters are introduced.\r\nThey stand in a clump outside the circle, and in turns step forward\r\nand strut round it[762]. Each is announced, by himself or by his\r\npredecessor or by the presenter, with a set of rhymes closely parallel\r\nto those used in the sword-dances. With the fighters generally\r\ncomes the ‘King of Egypt’ (occasionally corrupted into the ‘King of\r\nEngland’), and the description of St. George often contains an allusion\r\nto his fight with the dragon and the rescue of Sabra, the King of\r\nEgypt’s daughter. In one or two of the northern versions (Newcastle,\r\nWhitehaven) the King of Egypt is a fighter; generally he stands by. In\r\none of the Dorset versions (A) he is called ‘Anthony.’ Sabra appears\r\nonly in Cornwall, and keeps silence. The Dragon fights with St. George\r\nin Cornwall, and also, as we have seen, in the curious Brill _mêlée_.\r\n\r\nThe performance, naturally, ends with a _quête_. This takes various\r\nforms. Sometimes the presenter, or the whole body of actors, comes\r\nforward, and wishes prosperity to the household. Beelzebub, with his\r\nfrying-pan or ladle, goes round to gather in the contributions. In the\r\nversion preserved in _Sharpe’s London Magazine_, this is the function\r\nof a special personage, ‘Boxholder.’ In a considerable number of cases,\r\nhowever, the _quête_ is preceded by a singular action on the part of\r\nLittle Devil Dout. He enters with his broom, and threatens to sweep\r\nthe whole party out, or ‘into their graves,’ if money is not given. In\r\nShropshire and Staffordshire he sweeps up the hearth, and the custom is\r\nprobably connected with the superstition that it is unlucky to remove\r\nfire or ashes from the house on Christmas Day. ‘Dout’ appears to be a\r\ncorruption of ‘Do out[763].’\r\n\r\nAnother way of working in the grotesques and other supernumeraries\r\nis to give them minor parts in the drama itself. Father Christmas or\r\nthe King of Egypt is utilized as a sort of chorus, to cheer on the\r\nfighters, lament the vanquished, and summon the Doctor. At Newbold the\r\nwoman, called ‘Moll Finney,’ plays a similar part, as mother of the\r\nTurkish Knight. At Stoke Gabriel, Devon, the woman is the Doctor’s\r\nwife[764]. Finally, in three cases, a complete subordinate dramatic\r\nepisode is introduced for their sake. At Islip, after the main drama\r\nis concluded, the presenter Molly suddenly becomes King George’s wife\r\n‘Susannah.’ She falls ill, and the Doctor’s services are requisitioned\r\nto cure her. The Doctor rides in, not on a hobby-horse, but on one of\r\nthe disengaged characters who plays the part of a horse. In Dorsetshire\r\nthe secondary drama is quite elaborate. In the ‘A’ version ‘Old Bet’\r\ncalls herself ‘Dame Dorothy,’ and is the wife of Father Christmas,\r\nnamed, for the nonce, ‘Jan.’ They quarrel about a Jack hare, which\r\nhe wants fried and she wants roasted. He kills her, and at the happy\r\nmoment the Doctor is passing by, and brings her to life again. Version\r\n‘B’ is very similar, except that the performance closes by Old Bet\r\nbringing in the hobby-horse for Father Christmas to mount.\r\n\r\nI do not think that I need further labour the affiliation of the\r\nSt. George plays to the sword-dances. Placed in a series, as I have\r\nplaced them in these chapters, the two sets of performances show a\r\nsufficiently obvious continuity. They are held together by the use\r\nof the swords, by their common grotesques, and by the episode of the\r\nDoctor, which connects them also with the German Shrovetide and Whitsun\r\nfolk-ceremonies. They are properly called folk-drama, because they are\r\nderived, with the minimum of literary intervention, from the dramatic\r\ntendencies latent in folk-festivals of a very primitive type. They are\r\nthe outcome of the instinct of play, manipulating for its own purposes\r\nthe mock sacrifice and other débris of extinct ritual. Their central\r\nincident symbolizes the _renouveau_, the annual death of the year or\r\nthe fertilization spirit and its annual resurrection in spring[765].\r\nTo this have become attached some of those heroic _cantilenae_ which,\r\nas the early mediaeval chroniclers tell us, existed in the mouths\r\nof the _chori iuvenum_ side by side with the _cantilenae_ of the\r\nminstrels. The symbolism of the _renouveau_ is preserved unmistakably\r\nenough in the episode of the Doctor, but the _cantilenae_ have been\r\nto some extent modified by the comparatively late literary element,\r\ndue perhaps to that universal go-between of literature and the folk,\r\nthe village school-master. The genuine national heroes, a Stercatherus\r\nor a Galgacus, have given way to the ‘worthies’ and the ‘champions\r\nof Christendom,’ dear to Holophernes. The literary tradition has\r\nalso perhaps contributed to the transformation of the _chorus_ or\r\nsemi-dramatic dance into drama pure and simple. In the St. George\r\nplays dancing holds a very subordinate place, far more so than in\r\nthe ‘Plow-boys’ play of Revesby. Dances and songs are occasionally\r\nintroduced before the _quête_, but rarely during the main performance.\r\nIn the eccentric Brill version, however, a complete morris-dance\r\nappears. And of course it must be borne in mind that the fighting\r\nitself, with its gestures and pacings round the circle and clashing of\r\nswords, has much more the effect of a sword-dance than of a regular\r\nfight. So far as it is a fight, the question arises whether we ought to\r\nsee in it, besides the heroic element introduced by the _cantilenae_,\r\nany trace of the mimic contest between winter and summer, which is\r\nfound here and there, alternating with the resurrection drama, as a\r\nsymbolical representation of the _renouveau_. The fight does not, of\r\ncourse, in itself stand in any need of such an explanation; but it is\r\nsuggested by a singular passage which in several versions is put in the\r\nmouth of one or other of the heroes. St. George, or the Slasher, or the\r\nTurkish Knight, is made to boast something as follows:\r\n\r\n    ‘My arms are made of iron, my body’s made of steel,\r\n    My head is made of beaten brass, no man can make me feel.’\r\n\r\nIt does not much matter who speaks these words in the versions of\r\nHolophernes, but there are those who think that they originally\r\nbelonged to the representative of winter, and contained an allusion to\r\nthe hardness of the frost-bound earth[766]. Personally I do not see why\r\nthey should refer to anything but the armour which a champion might\r\nreasonably be supposed to wear.\r\n\r\nA curious thing about the St. George play is the width of its range.\r\nAll the versions, with the possible exception of that found at Brill,\r\nseem to be derived from a common type. They are spread over England,\r\nWales, Scotland and Ireland, and only in the eastern counties do\r\nthey give way to the partly, though not wholly, independent Plough\r\nMonday type. Unfortunately, the degeneracy of the texts is such that\r\nany closer investigation into their inter-relations or into the\r\norigin and transmission of the archetype would probably be futile.\r\nSomething, however, must be said as to the prominence, at any rate\r\noutside Scotland, of the character of St. George. As far as I can\r\nsee, the play owes nothing at all to John Kirke’s stage-play of _The\r\nSeven Champions of Christendom_, printed in 1638[767]. It is possible,\r\nhowever, that it may be a development of a sword-dance in which, as\r\nin the Shetland dance, the ‘seven champions’ had usurped the place\r\nof more primitive heroes. If so the six champions, other than St.\r\nGeorge, have singularly vanished[768]. In any case, there can have\r\nbeen no ‘seven champions,’ either in sword-dance or mummers’ play,\r\nbefore Richard Johnson brought together the scattered legends of the\r\nnational heroes in his _History of the Seven Champions_ in 1596[769].\r\nThis fact presents no difficulty, for the archetype of our texts need\r\ncertainly not be earlier than the seventeenth century[770]. By this\r\ntime the literary dramatic tradition was fully established, even in the\r\nprovinces, and it may well have occurred to Holophernes to convert the\r\nsword-dance into the semblance of a regular play.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the mediaeval period had its dramatic or\r\nsemi-dramatic performances in which St. George figured, and possibly it\r\nis to these, and not to the ‘seven champions,’ that his introduction\r\ninto the sword-dance is due. These performances generally took the\r\nform of a ‘riding’ or procession on St. George’s day, April 23. Such\r\nridings may, of course, have originally, like the Godiva processions\r\nor the midsummer shows, have preserved the memory of the pre-Christian\r\nperambulations of the fields in spring, but during the period for\r\nwhich records are available they were rather municipal celebrations\r\nof a semi-ecclesiastical type. St. George was the patron saint of\r\nEngland, and his day was honoured as one of the greater feasts, notably\r\nat court, where the chivalric order of the Garter was under his\r\nprotection[771]. The conduct of the ridings was generally, from the end\r\nof the fourteenth century onwards, in the hands of a guild, founded not\r\nas a trade guild, but as a half social, half religious fraternity, for\r\nthe worship of the saint, and the mutual aid and good fellowship of\r\nits members. The fullest accounts preserved are from Norwich where the\r\nguild or company of St. George was founded in 1385, received a charter\r\nfrom Henry V in 1416, and by 1451 had obtained a predominant share in\r\nthe government of the city[772]. The records of this guild throw a good\r\ndeal of light on the riding. The brethren and ‘sustren’ had a chapel in\r\nthe choir of the cathedral, and after the Reformation held their feasts\r\nin a chapel of the common hall of the city, which had formerly been\r\nthe church of a Dominican convent. The riding was already established\r\nby 1408 when the court of the guild ordered that ‘the George shall go\r\nin procession and make a conflict with the Dragon and keep his estate\r\nboth days.’ The George was a man in ‘coat armour beaten with silver,’\r\nand had his club-bearer, henchmen, minstrels and banners. He was\r\naccompanied by the Dragon, the guild-priest, and the court and brethren\r\nof the guild in red and white capes and gowns. The procession went\r\nto ‘the wood’ outside the city, and here doubtless the conflict with\r\nthe dragon took place. By 1537 there had been added to the _dramatis\r\npersonae_ St. Margaret, also called ‘the lady,’ who apparently aided\r\nSt. George in his enterprise[773]. Strange to say, the guild survived\r\nthe Reformation. In 1552, the court ordered, ‘there shall be neither\r\nGeorge nor Margaret, but for pastime the dragon to come and show\r\nhimself, as in other years.’ But the feast continued, and in spite of\r\nan attempt to get rid of him under the Long Parliament, the Dragon\r\nendured until 1732 when the guild was dissolved. Eighteenth-century\r\nwitnesses describe the procession as it then existed. The Dragon was\r\ncarried by a man concealed in its body. It was of basket work and\r\npainted cloth, and could move or spread its wings, and distend or\r\ncontract its head. The ranks were kept by ‘whifflers’ who juggled with\r\ntheir swords, and by ‘Dick Fools,’ in motley and decked with cats’\r\ntails and small bells. There is one more point of interest about the\r\nNorwich guild. In the fifteenth century it included many persons of\r\ndistinction in Norfolk. Sir John Fastolf gave it an ‘angell silver and\r\nguylt.’ And amongst the members in 1496 was Sir John Paston. I have\r\nalready quoted the lament in the _Paston Letters_ over William Woode,\r\nthe keeper, whom the writer ‘kepyd thys iij yer to pleye Seynt Jorge\r\nand Robyn Hod and the Shryff off Nottyngham,’ and who at a critical\r\nmoment went off to Bernysdale and left his master in the lurch[774]. I\r\nhave also identified his Robin Hood play, and now it becomes apparent\r\nwhere he played ‘Seynt Jorge.’ It is curious how the fragments of the\r\nwreckage of time fit into one another. The riding of the George is not\r\npeculiar to Norwich. We find it at Leicester[775], at Coventry[776],\r\nat Stratford[777], at Chester[778], at York, at Dublin[779]. An\r\nelaborate programme for the Dublin procession is preserved. It included\r\nan emperor and empress with their train, St. George on horse-back, the\r\ndragon led by a line and the king and queen of Dele. But no princess is\r\nmentioned. The ‘may’ or maiden figured at York, however, and there was\r\nalso a St. Christopher. At other places, such as Reading, Aston[780]\r\nand Louth[781], an equestrian figure, called a ‘George,’ is known to\r\nhave stood on a ‘loft’ in the church, and here, too, an annual ‘riding’\r\nmay be presumed.\r\n\r\nThere is no proof that the dramatic element in these ‘ridings’ was\r\nanything more than a _mystère mimé_, or pageant in dumb show. On the\r\nother hand, there were places where the performance on St. George’s\r\nday took the form of a regular miracle-play. The performance described\r\nby Collier as taking place before Henry V and the Emperor Sigismund at\r\nWindsor in 1416 turns out on examination of Collier’s authority to be\r\nreally a ‘soteltie,’ a cake or raised pie of elaborate form. But the\r\ntown of Lydd had its St. George play in 1456, and probably throughout\r\nthe century; while in 1490 the chaplain of the guild of St. George at\r\nNew Romney went to see this Lydd play with a view to reproducing it at\r\nthe sister town. In 1511 again a play of St. George is recorded to have\r\nbeen held at Bassingbourne in Cambridgeshire, not on St. George’s, but\r\non St. Margaret’s day[782].\r\n\r\nObviously the subject-matter of all these pageants and miracles was\r\nprovided by the familiar ecclesiastical legend of St. George the\r\ndragon-slayer, with which was occasionally interwoven the parallel\r\nlegend of St. Margaret[783]. Similar performances can be traced on the\r\ncontinent. There was one at Mons called _le lumeçon_[784]. Rabelais\r\ndescribes one at Metz, of which, however, the hero was not St. George,\r\nbut yet another dragon-slayer, St. Clement[785]. There is no need to\r\nascribe to them a folk origin, although the dragon-slaying champion\r\nis a common personage in folk-tale[786]. They belong to the cycle of\r\nreligious drama, which is dealt with in the second volume of this book.\r\nAnd although in Shropshire at least they seem to have been preserved in\r\na village stage-play up to quite a recent date[787], they obviously\r\ndo not directly survive in the folk-play with which we are concerned.\r\nAs far as I know, that nowhere takes place on St. George’s day. The\r\nDragon is very rarely a character, and though St. George’s traditional\r\nexploit is generally mentioned, it is, as that very mention shows,\r\nnot the motive of the action. On the other hand the legend, in its\r\nmediaeval form, has no room for the episode of the Doctor[788]. At the\r\nsame time the Dragon does sometimes occur, and the traditional exploit\r\nis mentioned, and therefore if any one chooses to say that the fame of\r\nSt. George in the guild celebrations as well as the fame of the ‘seven\r\nchampions’ romance determined his choice as the hero of the later\r\nsword-dance rhymes, I do not see that there is much to urge against the\r\nview[789].\r\n\r\nWith regard to the main drift of this chapter, the criticism presents\r\nitself; if the folk-plays are essentially a celebration of the\r\n_renouveau_ of spring, how is it that the performances generally take\r\nplace in mid-winter at Christmas? The answer is that, as will be shown\r\nin the next chapter, none of the Christmas folk-customs are proper to\r\nmid-winter. They have been attracted by the ecclesiastical feast from\r\nthe seasons which in the old European calendar preceded and followed\r\nit, from the beginning of winter and the beginning of summer or spring.\r\nThe folk-play has come with the rest. But the transference has not\r\ninvariably taken place. The Norfolk versions belong not to Christmas\r\nbut to Plough Monday, which lies immediately outside the Christmas\r\nseason proper, and is indeed, though probably dislocated from its\r\nprimitive date, the earliest of the spring feasts. The St. George\r\nplay itself is occasionally performed at Easter, and even perhaps on\r\nMay-day, whilst versions, which in their present form contain clear\r\nallusions to Christmas, yet betray another origin by the title which\r\nthey bear of the ‘Pace-eggers’’ or ‘Pasque-eggers’’ play[790].\r\nChristmas, however, has given to the play the characteristic figure\r\nof Old Father Christmas. And the players are known as ‘mummers’ and\r\n‘guisers,’ or, in Cornwall, ‘geese-dancers,’ because their performance\r\nwas regarded as a variety of the ‘mumming’ or ‘disguising’ which,\r\nas we shall see, became a regular name for the Christmas revel or\r\n_quête_[791].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n                        THE BEGINNING OF WINTER\r\n\r\n    [_Bibliographical Note._--I have largely followed the conclusions\r\n    of A. Tille, _Deutsche Weihnacht_ (1893) and _Yule and Christmas_\r\n    (1899). The Roman winter feasts are well treated by J. Marquardt\r\n    and T. Mommsen, _Handbuch der römischen Alterthümer_ (3rd\r\n    ed. 1881-8), vol. vii; W. W. Fowler, _The Roman Festivals of\r\n    the Period of the Republic_ (1899); G.

G.\r\n    Graevius, _Thesaurus Antiquitatum Romanarum_ (1699), vol. xii. I\r\n    have brought together a number of ecclesiastical references to\r\n    the Kalends, from the third to the eleventh century, in Appendix\r\n    N.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far this study has concerned itself, on the one hand with the\r\ngeneral character of the peasant festivals, on the other with the\r\nspecial history of such of these as fall within the summer cycle of the\r\nagricultural year, from ploughing to harvest. The remaining chapters\r\nwill approach the corresponding festivals, centring around Christmas,\r\nof winter. These present a somewhat more difficult problem, partly\r\nbecause their elements are not quite so plainly agricultural, partly\r\nbecause of the remarkable dislocations which the development and clash\r\nof civilizations have brought about.\r\n\r\nIt must, I think, be taken as established that the Germano-Keltic\r\ntribes had no primitive mid-winter feast, corresponding directly to\r\nthe modern Christmas[792]. They had no solstitial feast, for they knew\r\nnothing of the solstices. And although they had a winter feast of the\r\ndead, belonging rather to the domestic than to the elemental side of\r\ncult, this probably fell not at the middle, but at the beginning of the\r\nseason. It was an aspect in the great feast with which not the winter\r\nonly but the Germano-Keltic year began. This took place when the\r\nadvance of snow and frost drove the warriors back from foray and the\r\ncattle from the pastures. The scarcity of fodder made the stall-feeding\r\nof the whole herd an impossibility, and there was therefore an economic\r\nreason for a great slaughtering. This in its turn led to a great\r\nbanquet on the fresh meat, and to a great sacrifice, accompanied with\r\nthe usual perambulations, water-rites and fire-rites which sacrifice\r\nto the deities of field and flock entailed[793]. The vegetation spirit\r\nwould again be abroad, no longer, as in spring or summer, in the form\r\nof flowers and fresh green boughs, but in that of the last sheaf or\r\n‘kern-baby’ saved from harvest, or in that of such evergreens or rarer\r\nblossoms as might chance to brave the snows. The particular ‘intention’\r\nof the festival would be to secure the bounty of the divine powers for\r\nthe coming year, and a natural superstition would find omens for the\r\nwhole period in the events of the initial day. The feast, however,\r\nwould be domestic, as well as seasonal. The fire on the hearth was\r\nmade ‘new,’ and beside it the fathers, resting from the toils of war,\r\nor herding or tillage, held jollification with their children. Nor\r\nwere the dead forgotten. _Minni_ were drunk in honour of ancestors and\r\nancestral deities; and a share of the banquet was laid out for such\r\nof these as might be expected, in the whirl of the wintry storm, to\r\nrevisit the familiar house-place.\r\n\r\nOriginally, no doubt, the time of the feast was determined by the\r\nactual closing of the war-ways and the pastures. Just as the first\r\nviolet or some migratory bird of March was hailed for the herald of\r\nsummer, so the first fall of snow gave the signal that winter was\r\nat hand[794]. In the continental home of the Germano-Keltic tribes\r\namongst the forests of central Europe this would take place with\r\nsome regularity about the middle of November[795]. A fixed date for\r\nthe feast could only arise when, at some undefined time, the first\r\ncalendar, the ‘three-score-day-tide’ calendar of unknown origin, was\r\nintroduced[796]. Probably it was thenceforward held regularly upon\r\na day corresponding to either November the 11th or the 12th in our\r\nreckoning. If it is accurately represented by St. Martin’s day, it was\r\nthe 11th[797], if by the Manx _Samhain_, the 12th[798]. It continued\r\nto begin the year, and also the first of the six tides into which\r\nthat year was divided. As good fortune will have it, the name of that\r\ntide is preserved to us in the Gothic term _Iiuleis_ for November and\r\nDecember[799], in the Anglo-Saxon _Giuli_ or _Geola_ which, according\r\nto Bede, applied both to December and to January[800], and in _Yule_,\r\nthe popular designation, both in England and Scandinavia, of Christmas\r\nitself[801]. The meaning of this name is, however, more doubtful. The\r\nolder philology, with solstices running in its brain, supposed that\r\nit applied primarily to a mid-winter feast, and connected it with the\r\nAnglo-Saxon _hwéol_, a wheel[802]. Bede himself, learned in Roman\r\nlore, seems to hint at such an explanation[803]. The current modern\r\nexplanation derives the word from a supposed Germanic _jehwela_,\r\nequivalent to the Latin _ioculus_[804]. It would thus mean simply a\r\n‘feast’ or ‘rejoicing,’ and some support seems to be lent to this\r\nderivation by the occasional use of the English ‘_yule_’ and the\r\nKeltic _gwyl_ to denote feasts other than that of winter[805]. Other\r\ngood authorities, however, prefer to trace it to a Germanic root\r\n_jeula_-from which is derived the Old Norse _él_, ‘a snowstorm’; and\r\nthis also, so far as its application to the feast and tide of winter\r\nis concerned, seems plausible enough[806]. It is possible that to\r\nthe winter feast originally belonged the term applied by Bede to\r\nDecember 24 of _Modranicht_ or _Modraneht_[807]. It would be tempting\r\nto interpret this as ‘the night which gives birth to the year’; but\r\nphilologists say that it can only mean ‘night of mothers,’ and we must\r\ntherefore explain it as due to some cult of the _Matres_ or triad of\r\nmother-goddesses, which took place at the feast[808].\r\n\r\nThe subsequent history of the winter feast consists in its gradual\r\ndislocation from the original mid-November position, and dispersion\r\nover a large number of dates covering roughly the whole period between\r\nMichaelmas and Twelfth night. For this process a variety of causes are\r\nresponsible. Some of these are economic. As civilization progressed,\r\nmid-November came to be, less than of old, a signal turning-point in\r\nthe year. In certain districts to which the Germano-Keltic tribes\r\npenetrated, in Gaul, for instance, or in Britain with its insular\r\nclimate, the winter tarried, and the regular central European closing\r\nof the pastures was no longer a law. Then again tillage came gradually\r\nto equal or outstrip pasturage in importance, and the year of tillage\r\nclosed, even in Germany, at the end of September rather than in\r\nmid-November. The harvest feast began to throw the winter feast rather\r\ninto the shade as a wind-up of the year’s agricultural labours.\r\nThis same development of tillage, together with the more scientific\r\nmanagement of pasturage itself, did more. It provided a supply of\r\nfodder for the cattle, and by making stall-feeding possible put off\r\nfurther and further into the winter the necessity of the great annual\r\nslaughter. The importance in Germany, side by side with St. Martin’s\r\nday (November 11), of St. Andrew’s day (November 30), and still more\r\nSt. Nicholas’ day (December 6)[809], as folk-feasts, seems to suggest a\r\nconsequent tendency to a gradual shifting of the winter festival.\r\n\r\nThese economic causes came gradually into operation throughout a number\r\nof centuries. In displacing the November feast, they prepared the way\r\nfor and assisted the action of one still more important. This was the\r\ninfluence of Roman usage. When the Germano-Keltic tribes first came\r\ninto contact with the Roman world, the beginning of the Roman year was\r\nstill, nominally at least, upon the Kalends, or first of March. This\r\ndid not, so far as I know, leave any traces upon the practice of the\r\nbarbarians[810]. In 45 B.C. the Julian calendar replaced the Kalends of\r\nMarch by those of January. During the century and a half that followed,\r\nGaul became largely and Britain partially Romanized, while there was\r\na steady infiltration of Roman customs and ideas amongst the German\r\ntribes about and even far beyond the Rhine. With other elements of the\r\nsouthern civilization came the Roman calendar which largely replaced\r\nthe older Germanic calendar of three-score-day-tides. The old winter\r\nfestival fell in the middle of a Roman month, and a tendency set in to\r\ntransfer the whole or a part of its customs either to the beginning\r\nof this month[811] or, more usually, to the beginning of the Roman\r\nyear, a month and a half later. This process was doubtless helped by\r\nthe fact that the Roman New Year customs were not in their origin,\r\nor even at the period of contact, essentially different from those\r\nof their more northerly cousins. It remained, of course, a partial\r\nand incomplete one. In Gaul, where the Roman influence was strongest,\r\nit probably reached its maximum. But in Germany the days of St.\r\nMartin[812] and St. Nicholas[813] have fully maintained their position\r\nas folk-feasts by the side of New Year’s day, and even Christmas\r\nitself; while St. Martin’s day at least has never been quite forgotten\r\nin our islands[814]. The state of transition is represented by the\r\nisolated Keltic district known as the Isle of Man. Here, according to\r\nProfessor Rhys, the old _Samhain_ or Hollantide day of November 12 is\r\nstill regarded by many of the inhabitants as the beginning of the year.\r\nOthers accept January 1; and there is considerable division of opinion\r\nas to which is the day whereon the traditional New Year observances\r\nshould properly be held[815].\r\n\r\nA final factor in the dislocation of the winter feast was the\r\nintroduction of Christianity, and in especial the establishment of\r\nthe great ecclesiastical celebration of Christmas. When Christianity\r\nfirst began to claim the allegiance of the Roman world, the rulers of\r\nthe Church were confronted by a series of southern winter feasts which\r\ntogether made the latter half of December and the beginning of January\r\ninto one continuous carnival. The nature and position of these feasts\r\nclaim a brief attention.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there were the feasts of the Sun. The _Bruma_\r\n(_brevissima_) or _Brumalia_ was held on November 24, as the day\r\nwhich ushered in the period of the year during which the sun’s light\r\nis diminished. This seems to have been a beginning of winter feast,\r\nadopted by Rome from Thrace[816]. The term _bruma_ was also sometimes\r\napplied to the whole period between November 24 and the solstice,\r\nand ultimately even to the solstitial day itself, fixed somewhat\r\nincorrectly by the Julian calendar on December 25[817]. On this day\r\nalso came a festival, which probably owed its origin to the Emperor\r\nAurelian (270-75), whose mother was a semi-Oriental priestess of\r\nthe Sun, in one of his Syrian forms as Baal or Belus[818], and who\r\ninstituted an official cult of this divinity at Rome with a temple on\r\nthe Quirinal, a _collegium_ of _pontifices_, and _ludi circenses_ held\r\nevery fourth year[819]. These fell on the day of the solstice, which\r\nfrom the lengthening of the sun’s course was known as the ‘birthday’\r\nof _Sol Novus_ or _Sol Invictus_[820]. This cult was practised by\r\nDiocletian and by Constantine before his conversion, and was the\r\nrallying-point of Julian in his reaction against Christianity[821].\r\nMoreover, the _Sol Invictus_ was identified with the central figure\r\nof that curious half-Oriental, half-philosophical worship of Mithra,\r\nwhich at one time threatened to become a serious rival to Christianity\r\nas the religion of the thinking portion of the Roman world[822]. That\r\nan important Mithraic feast also fell on December 25 can hardly be\r\ndoubted, although there is no direct evidence of the fact[823].\r\n\r\nThe cult of the _Sol Invictus_ was not a part of the ancient Roman\r\nreligion, and, like the _Brumalia_, the solstitial festival in his\r\nhonour, however important to the educated and official classes of the\r\nempire, was not a folk-festival. It lay, however, exactly between two\r\nsuch festivals. The _Saturnalia_ immediately preceded it; a few days\r\nlater followed the January _Kalends_.\r\n\r\nThe _Saturnalia_, so far as the religious feast of Saturn was\r\nconcerned, took place on December 17. Augustus, however, added two\r\ndays to the _feriae iudiciariae_, during which the law-courts were\r\nshut, and popular usage extended the festival to seven. Amongst the\r\ncustoms practised was that of the _sigillariorum celebritas_, a kind of\r\nfair, at which the _sigillaria_, little clay dolls or _oscilla_, were\r\nbought and given as presents. Originally, perhaps, these _oscilla_ were\r\nlike some of our feasten cakes, figures of dough. Candles (_cerei_ or\r\n_candelae_) appear also to have been given. On the second and third\r\ndays it was customary to bathe in the early morning[824]. But the\r\nchief characteristic of the feast was the licence allowed to the lower\r\nclasses, to freedmen and to slaves. During the _libertas Decembris_\r\nboth moral and social restraints were thrown off[825]. Masters made\r\nmerry with their servants, and consented for the time to be on a\r\nfooting of strict equality with them[826]. A _rex Saturnalitius_,\r\nchosen by lot, led the revels, and was entitled to claim obedience for\r\nthe most ludicrous commands[827].\r\n\r\nThe similarity of the _Saturnalia_ to the folk-feasts of western Europe\r\nwill be at once apparent. The name _Saturnus_ seems to point to a\r\nploughing and sowing festival, although how such a festival came to be\r\nheld in mid-December must be matter of conjecture[828]. The _Kalends_,\r\non the other hand, are clearly a New Year festival. They began on\r\nJanuary 1, with the solemn induction of the new consuls into office. As\r\nin the case of the _Saturnalia_, the _feriae_ lasted for more than one\r\nday, covering at least a _triduum_. The third day was the day of _vota_\r\nor solemn wishes of prosperity for the New Year to the emperor. The\r\nhouses were decked with lights and greenery, and once more the masters\r\ndrank and played dice with their slaves. The resemblance in this\r\nrespect between the _Kalends_ and the _Saturnalia_ was recognized by a\r\nmyth which told how when Saturn came bringing the gifts of civilization\r\nto Italy he was hospitably received by Janus, who then reigned in the\r\nland[829]. Another Kalends custom, the knowledge of which we owe to the\r\ndenunciations of the Fathers, was the parading of the city by bands\r\nof revellers dressed in women’s clothes or in the skins of animals.\r\nAnd, finally, a series of superstitious observances testified to the\r\nbelief that the events of the first day of the year were ominous for\r\nthose of the year itself. A table loaded all night long with viands\r\nwas to ensure abundance of food; such necessaries of life as iron\r\nand fire must not be given or lent out of the house, lest the future\r\nsupply of them should fail. To this order of ideas belonged, ultimately\r\nat least, if not originally, the central feature of the whole feast,\r\nthe _strenae_ or presents so freely exchanged between all classes of\r\nsociety on the Kalends. Once, so tradition had it, the _strenae_ were\r\nnothing more than twigs plucked from the grove of the goddess Strenia,\r\nassociated with Janus in the feast[830]; but in imperial times men\r\ngave honeyed things, that the year of the recipient might be full of\r\nsweetness, lamps that it might be full of light, copper and silver and\r\ngold that wealth might flow in amain[831].\r\n\r\nNaturally, the Fathers were not slow to protest against these feasts,\r\nand, in particular, against the participation in them of professing\r\nChristians. Tertullian is, as usual, explicit and emphatic in his\r\ncondemnation[832]. The position was aggravated when, probably in the\r\nfourth century, the Christian feast of the Birthday of Christ came to\r\nbe fixed upon December 25, in the very heart of the pagan rejoicings\r\nand upon the actual day hitherto sacred to _Sol Invictus_. The origin\r\nof Christmas is wrapped in some obscurity[833]. The earliest notices\r\nof a celebration of the birth of Christ in the eastern Church attach\r\nit to that of his baptism on the Epiphany. This feast is as old as\r\nthe second century. By the fourth it was widespread in the East, and\r\nwas known also in Gaul and probably in northern Italy[834]. At Rome\r\nit cannot be traced so early; but it was generally adopted there by\r\nthe beginning of the fifth, and Augustine blames the Donatists for\r\nrejecting it, and so cutting themselves off from fellowship with the\r\nEast[835]. Christmas, on the other hand, made its appearance first at\r\nRome, and the East only gradually and somewhat grudgingly accepted it.\r\nThe Paulician Christians of Armenia to this day continue to feast the\r\nbirth and the baptism together on January 6, and to regard the normal\r\nChristian practice as heretical. An exact date for the establishment of\r\nthe Roman feast cannot be given, for the theory which ascribed it to\r\nPope Liberius in 353 has been shown to be baseless[836]. But it appears\r\nfrom a document of 336 that the beginning of the liturgical year then\r\nalready fell between December 8 and 27[837]. Christmas may, therefore,\r\nbe assumed to have been in existence at least by 336.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, then, that the fourth century witnessed the\r\nestablishment, both at Rome and elsewhere, of Christmas and Epiphany\r\nas two distinct feasts, whereas only one, although probably not\r\neverywhere the same one, had been known before. This fact is hardly to\r\nbe explained by a mere attempt to accommodate varying local uses. The\r\ntradition of the Armenian doctors, who stood out against Christmas,\r\nasserts that their opponents removed the birthday of Christ from\r\nJanuary 6 out of ‘disobedience[838].’ This points to a doctrinal reason\r\nfor the separate celebration of the birth and the baptism. And such a\r\nreason may perhaps be found in the Adoptionist controversies. The joint\r\nfeast appeared to lend credence to the view, considered a heresy, but\r\nstill adhered to by the Armenian Church, that Christ was God, not from\r\nhis mother’s womb, but only from his adoption or spiritual birth at\r\nthe baptism in Jordan. It was needful that orthodox Christians should\r\ncelebrate him as divine from the very moment of his carnal birth[839].\r\n\r\nThe choice of December 25 as the day for the Roman feast cannot be\r\nsupposed to rest upon any authentic tradition as to the historic\r\ndate of the Nativity. It is one of several early patristic guesses\r\non the subject. It is not at all improbable that it was determined\r\nby an attempt to adopt some of the principal Christian festivals\r\nto the solstices and equinoxes of the Roman calendar[840]. The\r\nenemies of Roman orthodoxy were not slow to assert that it merely\r\ncontinued under another name the pagan celebration of the birthday\r\nof _Sol Invictus_[841]. Nor was the suggestion entirely an empty\r\none. The worshippers of _Sol Invictus_, and in particular the\r\nMithraic sect, were not quite on the level of the ordinary pagans by\r\ntradition. Mithraism had claims to be a serious and reasonable rival\r\nto Christianity, and if its adherents could be induced by argument\r\nto merge their worship of the physical sun in that of the ‘Sun of\r\nRighteousness,’ they were well worth winning[842]. On the other hand\r\nthere were obvious dangers in the Roman policy which were not wholly\r\naverted, and we find Leo the Great condemning certain superstitious\r\ncustoms amongst his flock which it is difficult to distinguish from\r\nthe sun-worship practised alike by pagans and by Saint Augustine’s\r\nheretical opponents, the Manichaeans[843].\r\n\r\nFrom Rome the Christmas feast gradually made its way over East and\r\nWest. It does not seem to have reached Jerusalem until at least the\r\nsixth century, and, as we have seen, the outlying Church of Armenia\r\nnever adopted it. But it was established at Antioch about 375 and at\r\nAlexandria about 430[844]. At Constantinople an edict of 400 included\r\nit in the list of holy days upon which _ludi_ must not be held[845].\r\nIn 506 the council of Agatha recognized the Nativity as one of the\r\ngreat days of the Christian year[846], while fasting on that day was\r\nforbidden by the council of Braga in 561 as savouring of Priscillianist\r\nheresy[847]. The feast of the Epiphany, meanwhile, was relegated to a\r\nsecondary place; but it was not forgotten, and served as a celebration,\r\nin addition to the baptism, of a number of events in the life of\r\nChrist, which included the marriage at Cana and the feeding of the\r\nfive thousand, and of which the visit of the _Magi_ gradually became\r\nthe leading feature. The _Dodecahemeron_, or period of twelve days,\r\nlinking together Christmas and Epiphany, was already known to Ephraim\r\nSyrus as a festal tide at the end of the fourth century[848], and was\r\ndeclared to be such by the council of Tours in 567[849].\r\n\r\nTo these islands Christmas came, if not with the Keltic Church, at\r\nleast with St. Augustine in 592. On Christmas day, 598, more than ten\r\nthousand English converts were baptized[850], and by the time of Bede\r\n(†734) Christmas was established, with Epiphany and Easter, as one of\r\nthe three leading festivals of the year[851]. The _Laws_ of Ethelred\r\n(991-1016) and of Edward the Confessor ordain it a holy tide of peace\r\nand concord[852]. Continental Germany received it from the synod of\r\nMainz in 813[853], while Norway owed it to King Hakon the Good in the\r\nmiddle of the tenth century[854].\r\n\r\nSide by side with the establishment of Christmas proceeded the\r\necclesiastical denunciation of those pagan festivals whose place it was\r\nto take. Little is heard in Christian times of the _Saturnalia_, which\r\ndo not seem to have shared the popularity of the Kalends outside the\r\nlimits of Rome itself. But these latter, and especially the Kalends,\r\nare the subject of attack in every corner of the empire. Jerome of\r\nRome, Ambrose of Milan, Maximus of Turin, Chrysologus of Ravenna,\r\nassail them in Italy; Augustine in Africa; Chrysostom and Asterius and\r\nthe Trullan council in the East. In Spain, Bishop Pacian of Barcelona\r\nmade a treatise upon one of the most objectionable features of the\r\nfestival which, as he says with some humour, probably tended to\r\nincrease its vogue. In Gaul, Caesarius of Arles initiated a vigorous\r\ncampaign. To cite all the ecclesiastical pronouncements on the subject\r\nwould be tedious. Homily followed homily, canon followed canon,\r\ncapitulary followed capitulary, penitential followed penitential, for\r\nhalf a thousand years. But the Kalends died hard. When Boniface was\r\ntackling them amongst the Franks in the middle of the eighth century,\r\nhe was sorely hampered by the bad example of their continued prevalence\r\nat the very gates of the Vatican; and when Burchardus was making his\r\ncollection of heathen observances in the eleventh century, those of\r\nthe Kalends were still to be included. In England there is not much\r\nheard of them, but a reference in the so-called _Penitential of Egbert_\r\nabout 766 proves that they were not unknown. It need hardly be said\r\nthat all formal religious celebration of the Kalends disappeared with\r\nthe official victory of Christianity. But this element had never\r\nbeen of great importance in the feast; and the terms in which the\r\necclesiastical references from beginning to end are couched prove that\r\nthey relate mainly to popular New Year customs common to the Germanic\r\nand the more completely Latinized populations[855].\r\n\r\nIt appears from a decree of the council of Tours in 567 that, _ad\r\ncalcandam Gentilium consuetudinem_, the fourth-century Fathers\r\nestablished on the first three days of January a _triduum ieiunii_,\r\nwith litanies, in spite of the fact that these days fell in the very\r\nmidst of the festal period of the _Dodecahemeron_[856]. At the same\r\ntime January 1 was kept as the octave of Christmas, and the early\r\nRoman ritual-books show two masses for that day, one _in octavis\r\nDomini_, the other _ad prohibendum ab idolis_. The Jewish custom by\r\nwhich circumcision took place eight days after birth made it almost\r\ninevitable that there should be some celebration of the circumcision\r\nof Christ upon the octave of his Nativity. This was the case from\r\nthe sixth century, and ultimately, about the eighth, the attempt to\r\nkeep up a fast on January 1 was surrendered, and the festival of the\r\nCircumcision took its place[857].\r\n\r\nSome tendency was shown by the Church not merely to set up Christmas\r\nas a rival to the pagan winter feasts, but also to substitute it\r\nfor the Kalends of January as the beginning of the year. But the\r\ninnovation never affected the civil year, and was not maintained even\r\nby ecclesiastical writers with any consistency, for even they prefer\r\nin many cases a year dating from the Annunciation, or more rarely\r\nfrom Easter. The so-called Annunciation style found favour even for\r\nmany civil purposes in Great Britain, and was not finally abandoned\r\nuntil 1753[858]. But although Christmas cannot be said to have ever\r\nbecome a popular New Year’s day, yet its festal importance and its\r\npropinquity to January 1 naturally led to a result undesired and\r\npossibly undreamt of by its founders, namely, the further transference\r\nto it of many of the long-suffering Germano-Keltic folk-customs, which\r\nhad already travelled under Roman influence from the middle of November\r\nto the beginning of January[859]. Already in the sixth century it had\r\nbecome necessary to forbid the abuses which had gathered around the\r\ncelebration of Christmas eve[860]; and the Christmas customs of to-day,\r\neven where their name does not testify to their original connexion with\r\nthe Kalends[861], are in a large number of cases, so far of course as\r\nthey are not simply ecclesiastical, merely doublets of those of the New\r\nYear.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of Christmas is true also of Epiphany or Twelfth night;\r\nand the history of the other modern festivals of the winter cycle\r\nis closely parallel. The old Germanic New Year’s day on November 11\r\nbecame the day of St. Martin, a fourth-century bishop of Tours, and\r\nthe _pervigiliae_ of St. Martin, like those of the Nativity itself,\r\nalready caused a scandal in the sixth century[862]. The observances\r\nof the deferred days of slaughter clustered round the feasts of St.\r\nAndrew on November 30, and more especially St. Nicholas on December\r\n6. The _Todtenfest_, which had strayed to the beginning of November,\r\nwas continued in the feasts of All Saints or Hallowmas, the French\r\n_Toussaint_, on November 1, and its charitable supplement of All\r\nSouls, on November 2. That which had strayed still further to the\r\ntime of harvest became the _Gemeinwoche_ or week-wake, and ultimately\r\nSt. Michael and All Angels. Nor is this all. Very similar customs\r\nattached themselves to the minor feasts of the _Dodecahemeron_, St.\r\nStephen’s, St. John the Evangelist’s, Innocents’ days, to the numerous\r\ndedication wakes that fell on days, such as St. Luke’s[863], in autumn\r\nor early winter, or to the miscellaneous feasts closely approaching the\r\nChristmas season, St. Clement’s, St. Catherine’s, St. Thomas’s, with\r\nwhich indeed in many localities that season is popularly supposed to\r\nbegin[864]. Nor was this process sensibly affected by the establishment\r\nin the sixth century of the _ieiunium_ known as Advent, which stretched\r\nfor a _Quadragesima_, or period of forty days, from Martinmas onwards.\r\nAnd finally, just as in May village dipping customs attached themselves\r\nin the seventeenth century to Royal Oak day, so in the same century we\r\nfind the winter festival fires turned to new account in the celebration\r\nof the escape of King and Parliament from the nefarious machinations of\r\nGuy Fawkes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                           NEW YEAR CUSTOMS\r\n\r\n    [_Bibliographical Note._--The two works of Dr. Tille remain of\r\n    importance. The compilations specially devoted to the usages\r\n    of the Christmas season are chiefly of a popular character;\r\n    W. Sandys, _Christmas Tide_ (n. d.), J. Ashton, _A Righte\r\n    Merrie Christmasse!!!_ (n. d.), and, for French data, E.\r\n    Müller, _Le Jour de l’An_ (n. d.), may be mentioned; H.

Most of the books named in the bibliographical note to\r\n    chap. v also cover the subject. A _Bibliography of Christmas_\r\n    runs through _Notes and Queries_, 6th series, vi. 506, viii. 491,\r\n    x. 492, xii. 489; 7th series, ii. 502, iii. 152, iv. 502, vi.\r\n    483, x. 502, xii. 483; 8th series, ii. 505, iv. 502, vi. 483,\r\n    viii. 483, x. 512, xii. 502; 9th series, ii. 505, iv. 515, vi.\r\n    485.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the outcome of the last chapter that all the folk-customs of\r\nthe winter half of the year, from Michaelmas to Plough Monday, must\r\nbe regarded as the flotsam and jetsam of a single original feast.\r\nThis was a New Year’s feast, held by the Germano-Keltic tribes at the\r\nbeginning of the central European winter when the first snows fell\r\nabout the middle of November, and subsequently dislocated and dispersed\r\nby the successive clash of Germano-Keltic civilization with the rival\r\nschemes of Rome and of Christianity. A brief summary of the customs\r\nin question will show clearly their common character. For purposes of\r\nclassification they may be divided into several groups. There are such\r\ncustoms belonging to the agricultural side of the old winter feast as\r\nhave not been transferred with the growing importance of tillage to\r\nthe feast of harvest. There are the customs of its domestic side, as\r\na feast of the family hearth and of the dead ancestors. There are the\r\ndistinctively New Year customs of omen and prognostication for the\r\napproaching twelve months. There are the customs of play, common more\r\nor less to all the village festivals. And, finally, there are a small\r\nnumber of customs, or perhaps it would be truer to say legends, which\r\nappear to owe their origin not merely to heathenism transformed by\r\nChristianity, but to Christianity itself. Each of these groups may well\r\nclaim a more thoroughgoing consideration than can here be given to any\r\none of them.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural customs are just those of the summer feasts over\r\nagain. Once more the fertilization spirit is abroad in the land.\r\nThe embodiment of it in vegetation takes several forms. Obviously\r\nthe last foliage and burgeoning flowers of spring and summer are no\r\nlonger available. But there is, to begin with, the sheaf of corn or\r\n‘harvest-May’ in which the spirit appeared at harvest, and which is\r\ncalled upon once more to play its part in the winter rites. This,\r\nhowever, is not a very marked part. A Yorkshire custom of hanging a\r\nsheaf on the church door at Christmas is of dubious origin[865]. But\r\nSwedish and Danish peasants use the grain of the ‘last sheaf’ to bake\r\nthe Christmas cake, and both in Scandinavia and Germany the ‘Yule\r\nstraw’ serves various superstitious purposes. It is scattered on barren\r\nfields to make them productive. It is strewed, instead of rushes, upon\r\nthe house floor and the church floor. It is laid in the mangers of the\r\ncattle. Fruit-trees are tied together with straw ropes, that they may\r\nbear well and are said to be ‘married[866].’\r\n\r\nMore naturally the fertilization spirit may be discerned at the\r\napproach of winter in such exceptional forms of vegetation as endure\r\nthe season. In November the apples and the nuts still hang upon their\r\nboughs, and these are traditional features in the winter celebrations.\r\nThen there are the evergreens. Libanius, Tertullian, and Chrysostom\r\ntell how on the Kalends the doors of houses throughout the Roman\r\nempire were crowned with bay. Martin of Braga forbade the ‘pagan\r\nobservance’ in a degree which found its way into the canon law. The\r\noriginal _strena_ which men gave one another on the same day for luck\r\nwas nothing but a twig plucked from a sacred grove; and still in the\r\nfifth century men returned from their new year auguries laden with\r\n_ramusculi_ that they might thereafter be laden with wealth[867]. It\r\nis not necessary to dwell upon the surviving use of evergreens in the\r\ndecoration at Christmas of houses and churches[868]. The sacredness\r\nof these is reflected in the taboo which enjoins that they shall not\r\nbe cast out upon the dust-heap, but shall, when some appropriate day,\r\nsuch as Candlemas, arrives, be solemnly committed to the flames[869].\r\nObviously amongst other evergreens the holly and the ivy, with their\r\nclustering pseudo-blossoms of coral and of jet, are the more adequate\r\nrepresentatives of the fertilization spirit[870]; most of all the\r\nmistletoe, perched an alien visitant, faintly green and white, amongst\r\nthe bared branches of apple or of oak. The mistletoe has its especial\r\nplace in Scandinavian myth[871]: Pliny records the ritual use of it by\r\nthe Druids[872]; it is essential to the winter revels in their amorous\r\naspect; and its vanished dignities still serve, here to bar it from,\r\nthere to make it imperative in, the edifices of Christian worship[873].\r\nA more artificial embodiment of the fertilization spirit is the\r\n‘Christmas tree’ _par excellence_, adorned with lights and apples, and\r\noften with a doll or image upon the topmost sprig. The first recorded\r\nChristmas tree is at Strassburg in 1604. The custom is familiar enough\r\nin modern England, but there can be little doubt that here it is of\r\nrecent introduction, and came in, in fact, with the Hanoverians[874].\r\n\r\nFinally, there can be little wonder that the popular imagination found\r\na special manifestation of the fertilization spirit in the unusual\r\nblossoming of particular trees or species of trees in the depths of\r\nwinter. In mild seasons a crab or cherry might well adorn the old\r\nwinter feast in November. A favourable climate permits such a thing\r\neven at mid-winter. Legend, at any rate, has no doubt of the matter,\r\nand connects the event definitely with Christmas. A tenth-century\r\nArabian geographer relates how all the trees of the forest stand in\r\nfull bloom on the holy night. In the thirteenth-century _Vita_ of St.\r\nHadwigis the story is told of a cherry-tree. A fifteenth-century bishop\r\nof Bamberg tells it of two apple-trees, and to apple-trees the miracle\r\nbelongs, in German folk-belief, to this day[875]. In England the\r\nstories of Christmas-flowering hawthorns or blackthorns are specific\r\nand probably not altogether baseless[876]. The belief found a special\r\nlocation at Glastonbury, where the famous thorn is said by William of\r\nMalmesbury and other writers to have budded from the staff of Joseph of\r\nArimathea, who there ended his wanderings with the Holy Grail. Where\r\nwinter-flowering trees are not found, a custom sometimes exists of\r\nputting a branch of cherry or of hawthorn in water some weeks before\r\nChristmas in order that it may blossom and serve as a substitute[877].\r\n\r\nIt may fairly be conjectured that at the winter, as at the summer\r\nfeast, the fertilization spirit, in the form of bush or idol, was\r\nborne about the fields. The fifteenth-century writer, Alsso, records\r\nthe _calendisationes_ of the god Bel in Bohemia, suppressed by St.\r\nAdalbert[878]. In modern England, a ‘holly-bough’ or ‘wesley-bob,’ with\r\nor without an image or doll, occasionally goes its rounds[879]. But\r\na definite lustration of the bounds is rare[880], and, for the most\r\npart, the winter procession either is merely riotous or else, like too\r\nmany of the summer processions themselves, has been converted, under\r\nthe successive influence of the _strenae_ and the cash nexus, into\r\nlittle more than a _quête_. Thus children and the poor go ‘souling’ for\r\napples and ‘soul-cakes’ on All Souls’ day; on November 5 they collect\r\nfor the ‘guy’; on November 11 in Germany, if not in England, for St.\r\nMartin; on St. Clement’s day (November 23) they go ‘clemencing’; on\r\nSt. Catherine’s (November 25) ‘catherning.’ Wheat is the coveted boon\r\non St. Thomas’s day (December 21) or ‘doling day,’ and the _quête_\r\nis variously known as ‘thomasing,’ ‘mumping,’ ‘corning,’ ‘gooding,’\r\n‘hodening,’ or ‘hooding[881].’ Christmas brings ‘wassailing’ with its\r\nbowl of lamb’s-wool and its bobbing apple, and this is repeated on\r\nNew Year’s day or eve[882]. The New Year _quête_ is probably the most\r\nwidespread and popular of all. Ducange records it at Rome[883]. In\r\nFrance it is known as _l’Aguilaneuf_[884], in Scotland and the north\r\nof England as Hogmanay, terms in which the philologists meet problems\r\nstill unsolved[885]. Other forms of the winter _quête_ will crop up\r\npresently, and the visits of the guisers with their play or song, the\r\ncarol singers and the waits may be expected at any time during the\r\nChristmas season. As at the summer _quêtes_, some reminiscence of the\r\nprimitive character of the processions is to be found in the songs\r\nsung, with their wish of prosperity to the liberal household and their\r\nill-will to the churl[886].\r\n\r\nIn the summer festivals both water-rites and fire-rites frequently\r\noccur. In those of winter, water-rites are comparatively rare, as\r\nmight naturally be expected at a season when snow and ice prevail.\r\nThere is some trace, however, of a custom of drawing ‘new’ water, as\r\nof making ‘new’ fire, for the new year[887]. Festival fires, on the\r\nother hand, are widely distributed, and agree in general features with\r\nthose of summer. Their relation to the fertility of crop and herd is\r\noften plainly enough marked. They are perhaps most familiar to-day\r\nin the comparatively modern form of the Guy Fawkes celebration on\r\nNovember 5[888], but they are known also on St. Crispin’s day (October\r\n25)[889], Hallow e’en[890], St. Martin’s day[891], St. Thomas’s\r\nday[892], Christmas eve[893], New Year[894], and Twelfth night[895].\r\nAn elaborate and typical example is the ‘burning of the clavie’ at\r\nthe little fishing village of Burghead on the Moray Firth[896]. This\r\ntakes place on New Year’s eve, or, according to another account[897],\r\nChristmas eve (O.S.). Strangers to the village are excluded from any\r\nshare in the ritual. The ‘clavie’ is a blazing tar-barrel hoisted on a\r\npole. In making it, a stone must be used instead of a hammer, and must\r\nthen be thrown away. Similarly, the barrel must be lit with a blazing\r\npeat, and not with lucifer matches. The bearers are honoured, and the\r\nbridegroom of the year gets the ‘first lift.’ Should a bearer stumble,\r\nit portends death to himself during the year and ill-luck to the town.\r\nThe procession passes round the boundaries of Burghead, and formerly\r\nvisited every boat in the harbour. Then it is carried to the top of\r\na hillock called the ‘Doorie,’ down the sides of which it is finally\r\nrolled. Blazing brands are used to kindle the house fires, and the\r\nembers are preserved as charms.\r\n\r\nThe central heathen rite of sacrifice has also left its abundant traces\r\nupon winter custom. Bede records the significant name of _blôt-monath_,\r\ngiven to November by the still unconverted Anglo-Saxons[898]. The\r\ntradition of solemn slaughter hangs around both Martinmas and\r\nChristmas. ‘Martlemas beef’ in England, St. Martin’s swine, hens,\r\nand geese in Germany, mark the former day[899]. At Christmas the\r\noutstanding victim seems to be the boar. _Caput apri defero: reddens\r\nlaudem Domino_, sings the taberdar at Queen’s College, Oxford, as\r\nthe manciple bears in the boar’s head to the Christmas banquet. So\r\nit was sung in many another mediaeval and Elizabethan hall[900],\r\nwhile the gentlemen of the Inner Temple broke their Christmas fast on\r\n‘brawn, mustard, and malmsey[901],’ and in the far-off Orkneys each\r\nhouseholder of Sandwick must slay his sow on St. Ignace’s or ‘Sow’ day,\r\nDecember 17[902]. The older mythologists, with the fear of solstices\r\nbefore their eyes, are accustomed to connect the Christmas boar with\r\nthe light-god, Freyr[903]. If the cult of any one divinity is alone\r\nconcerned, the analogous use of the pig in the Eleusinian mysteries of\r\nDemeter would make the earth-goddess a more probable guess[904]. A few\r\nmore recondite customs associated with particular winter anniversaries\r\nmay be briefly named. St. Thomas’s day is at Wokingham the day for\r\nbull-baiting[905]. On St. Stephen’s day, both in England and Germany,\r\nhorses are let blood[906]. On or about Christmas, boys are accustomed\r\nto set on foot a hunt of victims not ordinarily destined to such a\r\nfate[907]; owls and squirrels, and especially wrens, the last, be it\r\nnoted, creatures which at other times of the year a taboo protects. The\r\nwren-hunt is found on various dates in France, England, Ireland, and\r\nthe Isle of Man, and is carried out with various curious rituals. Often\r\nthe body is borne in a _quête_, and in the Isle of Man the _quêteurs_\r\ngive a feather as an amulet in return for hospitality. There are\r\nother examples of winter _quêtes_, in which the representation of a\r\nsacrificial victim is carried round[908]. ‘Hoodening’ in Kent and other\r\nparts of England is accompanied by a horse’s head or hobby-horse[909].\r\nThe Welsh ‘Mari Lwyd’ is a similar feature[910], while at Kingscote,\r\nin Gloucestershire, the wassailers drink to a bull’s head called ‘the\r\nBroad[911].’\r\n\r\nThe hobby-horse is an example of an apparently grotesque element which\r\nis found widespread in folk-processions, and which a previous chapter\r\nhas traced to its ritual origin. The man clad in a beast-skin is the\r\nworshipper putting himself by personal contact under the influence\r\nand protection of the sacrificed god. The rite is not a very salient\r\none in modern winter processions, although it has its examples, but\r\nits historical importance is great. A glance at the ecclesiastical\r\ndenunciations of the Kalends collected in an appendix will disclose\r\nnumerous references to it. These are co-extensive with the western area\r\nof the Kalends celebrations. In Italy, in Gaul, in southern Germany,\r\napparently also in Spain and in England, men decked themselves for\r\nriot in the heads and skins of cattle and the beasts of the chase,\r\nblackened their faces or bedaubed them with filth, or wore masks fit\r\nto terrify the demons themselves. The accounts of these proceedings\r\nare naturally allusive rather than descriptive; the fullest are given\r\nby a certain Severian, whose locality and date are unknown, but\r\nwho may be conjectured to speak for Italy, by Maximus of Turin and\r\nChrysologus of Ravenna in the fifth century, and by Caesarius of Arles\r\nin the beginning of the sixth. Amongst the _portenta_ denounced is a\r\ncertain _cervulus_, which lingers in the _Penitentials_ right up to\r\nthe tenth century, and with which are sometimes associated a _vitula_\r\nor _iuvenca_. Caesarius adds a _hinnicula_, and St. Eadhelm, who is\r\nmy only authority for the presence of the _cervulus_ in England, an\r\n_ermulus_. These seem to be precisely of the nature of ‘hobby-horses.’\r\nMen are said _cervulum ambulare_, _cervulum facere_, _in cervulo\r\nvadere_, and Christians are forbidden to allow these _portenta_ to\r\ncome before their houses. The _Penitential_ of the Pseudo-Theodore\r\ntells us that the performers were those who wore the skins and heads\r\nof beasts. Maximus of Turin, and several writers after him, put the\r\nobjection to the beast-mimicry of the Kalends largely on the ground\r\nthat man made in the image of God must not transform himself into the\r\nimage of a beast. But it is clear that the real reason for condemning\r\nit was its unforgettable connexion with heathen cult. Caesarius warns\r\nthe culprit that he is making himself into a _sacrificium daemonum_,\r\nand the disguised reveller is more than once spoken of as a living\r\nimage of the heathen god or demon itself. There is some confusion of\r\nthought here, and it must be remembered that the initial significance\r\nof the skin-wearing rite was probably buried in oblivion, both for\r\nthose who practised it and for those who reprobated. But it is\r\nobvious that the worshipper wearing a sacrificial skin would bear a\r\nclose resemblance to the theriomorphic or semi-theriomorphic image\r\ndeveloped out of the sacrificial skin nailed on a tree-trunk; and\r\nit is impossible not to connect the fact that in the prohibitions a\r\n_cervulus_ or ‘hobby-buck’ rather than a ‘hobby-horse’ is prominent\r\nwith the widespread worship throughout the districts whence many of\r\nthese notices come of the mysterious stag-horned deity, the _Cernunnos_\r\nof the Gaulish altars[912]. On the whole I incline to think that at\r\nleast amongst the Germano-Keltic peoples the agricultural gods were not\r\nmimed in procession by human representatives. It is true that in the\r\nmediaeval German processions which sprang out of those of the Kalends\r\nSt. Nicholas plays a part, and that the presence of St. Nicholas may\r\nbe thought to imply that of some heathen precursor. It will, however,\r\nbe seen shortly that St. Nicholas may have got into these processions\r\nthrough a different train of ideas, equally connected with the Kalends,\r\nbut not with the strictly agricultural aspect of that festival. But of\r\nthe continuity of the beast-masks and other horrors of these Christmas\r\nprocessions with those condemned in the prohibitions, there can be no\r\ndoubt[913]. A few other survivals of the _cervulus_ and its revel can\r\nbe traced in various parts of Europe[914].\r\n\r\nThe sacrifices of cereals and of the juice of the vine or the barley\r\nare exemplified, the one by the traditional furmenty, plum-porridge,\r\nmince-pie, souling-cake, Yule-dough, Twelfth night cake, _pain de\r\ncalende_, and other forms of ‘feasten’ cake[915]; the other by the\r\nwassail-bowl with its bobbing apple[916]. The summer ‘youling’ or\r\n‘tree-wassailing’ is repeated in the orchard[917], and a curious\r\nHerefordshire custom represents an extension of the same principle to\r\nthe ox-byre[918]. A German hen-yard custom requires mixed corn, for\r\nthe familiar reason that every kind of crop must be included in the\r\nsacrifice[919].\r\n\r\nHuman sacrifice has been preserved in the whipping of boys on\r\nInnocents’ day, because it could be turned into the symbol of a\r\nChristian myth[920]. It is preserved also, as throughout the summer,\r\nin the custom, Roman as well as Germano-Keltic, of electing a mock\r\nor temporary king. Of such the Epiphany king or ‘king of the bean’\r\nis, especially in France, the best known[921]. Here again, the\r\nassociation with the three kings or _Magi_ has doubtless prolonged\r\nhis sway. But he is not unparalleled. The _rex autumnalis_ of Bath is\r\nperhaps a harvest rather than a beginning of winter king[922]. But the\r\nshoemakers choose their King Crispin on October 25, the day of their\r\npatron saints, Crispin and Crispinian; on St. Clement’s (November\r\n23) the Woolwich blacksmiths have their King Clem, and the maidens\r\nof Peterborough and elsewhere a queen on St. Catherine’s (November\r\n25). Tenby, again, elects its Christmas mock mayor[923]. At York, the\r\nproclaiming of Yule by ‘Yule’ and ‘Yule’s wife’ on St. Thomas’s day\r\nwas once a notable pageant[924]. At Norwich, the riding of a ‘kyng of\r\nCrestemesse’ was the occasion of a serious riot in 1443[925]. These may\r\nbe regarded as ‘folk’ versions of the mock king. Others, in which the\r\nfolk were less concerned, will be the subject of chapters to follow.\r\n\r\nBefore passing to a fresh group of Christmas customs, I must note the\r\npresence of one more bit of ritual closely related to sacrificial\r\nsurvivals. That is, the man masquerading in woman’s clothes, in whom we\r\nhave found a last faint reminiscence of the once exclusive supremacy\r\nof women in the conduct of agricultural worship. At Rome, musicians\r\ndressed as women paraded the city, not on the Kalends, but on the\r\nIdes of January[926]. The Fathers, however, know such disguising as\r\na Kalends custom, and a condemnation of it often accompanies that of\r\nbeast-mimicry, from the fourth to the eighth century[927].\r\n\r\nThe winter festival is thus, like the summer festivals, a moment in the\r\ncycle of agricultural ritual, and is therefore shared in by the whole\r\nvillage in common. It is also, and from the time of the institution\r\nof harvest perhaps preeminently, a festival of the family and the\r\nhomestead. This side of it finds various manifestations. There is the\r\nsolemn renewal of the undying fire upon the hearth, the central symbol\r\nand almost condition of the existence of the family as such. This\r\nsurvives in the institution of the ‘Yule-log,’ which throughout the\r\nGermano-Keltic area is lighted on Christmas or more rarely New Year’s\r\neve, and must burn, as local custom may exact, either until midnight,\r\nor for three days, or during the whole of the Twelve-night period,\r\nfrom Christmas to Epiphany[928]. Dr. Tille, intent on magnifying the\r\nRoman element in western winter customs, denies any Germano-Keltic\r\norigin to the Christmas blaze, and traces it to the Roman practice of\r\nhanging lamps upon the house-doors during the _Saturnalia_ and the\r\nKalends[929]. It is true that the Yule-log is sometimes supplemented\r\nor even replaced by the Christmas candle[930], but I do not think that\r\nthere can be any doubt which is the primitive form of rite. And the\r\nYule-log enters closely into the Germano-Keltic scheme of festival\r\nideas. The preservation of its brands or ashes to be placed in the\r\nmangers or mingled with the seed-corn suggests many and familiar\r\nanalogies. Moreover, it is essentially connected with the festival fire\r\nof the village, from which it is still sometimes, and once no doubt was\r\ninvariably, lit, affording thus an exact parallel to the Germano-Keltic\r\npractice on the occasion of summer festival fires, or of those built to\r\nstay an epidemic.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of the domestic character of the winter festival is\r\nto be found in the prominent part which children take in it. As\r\n_quêteurs_, they have no doubt gradually replaced the elder folk,\r\nduring the process through which, even within the historical purview,\r\nritual has been transformed into play. But St. Nicholas, the chief\r\nmythical figure of the festival, is their patron saint; for their\r\nbenefit especially, the _strenae_ or Christmas and New Year’s gifts are\r\nmaintained; and in one or two places it is their privilege, on some\r\nfixed day during the season, to ‘bar out’ their parents or masters[931].\r\n\r\nThirdly, the winter festival included a commemoration of ancestors.\r\nIt was a feast, not only of riotous life, but of the dead. For, to\r\nthe thinking of the Germano-Keltic peoples, the dead kinsmen were not\r\naltogether outside the range of human fellowship. They shared with the\r\nliving in banquets upon the tomb. They could even at times return to\r\nthe visible world and hover round the familiar precincts of their own\r\ndomestic hearth. The Germans, at least, heard them in the gusts of the\r\nstorm, and imagined for them a leader who became Odin. From another\r\npoint of view they were naturally regarded as under the keeping of\r\nearth, and the earth-mother, in one aspect a goddess of fertility, was\r\nin another the goddess of the dead. As such she was worshipped under\r\nvarious names and forms, amongst others in the triad of the _Matres_\r\nor _Matronae_. In mediaeval superstition she is represented by Frau\r\nPerchte, Frau Holda and similar personages, by Diana, by Herodias, by\r\nSt. Gertrude, just as the functions of Odin are transferred to St.\r\nMartin, St. Nicholas, St. John, Hellequin. It was not unnatural that\r\nthe return of the spirits, in the ‘wild hunt’ or otherwise, to earth\r\nshould be held to take place especially at the two primitive festivals\r\nwhich respectively began the winter and the summer. Of the summer or\r\nspring commemoration but scant traces are to be recovered[932]; that\r\nof winter survives, in a dislocated form, in more than one important\r\nanniversary. Its observances have been transferred with those of the\r\nagricultural side of the feast to the _Gemeinwoche_ of harvest[933];\r\nbut they are also retained, at or about their original date, on All\r\nSaints’ and All Souls’ days[934]; and, as I proceed to show, they form\r\na marked and interesting part of the Christmas and New Year ritual.\r\nI do not, indeed, agree with Dr. Mogk, who thinks that the Germans\r\nheld their primitive feast of the dead in the blackest time of winter,\r\nfor it seems to me more economical to suppose that the observances in\r\nquestion have been shifted like others from November to the Kalends.\r\nBut I still less share the view of Dr. Tille, who denies that any\r\nrelics of a feast of the dead can be traced in the Christmas season at\r\nall[935].\r\n\r\nBede makes the statement that the heathen Anglo-Saxons gave to the eve\r\nof the Nativity the name of _Modranicht_ or ‘night of mothers,’ and\r\nin it practised certain ceremonies[936]. It is a difficult passage,\r\nbut the most plausible of various explanations seems to be that\r\nwhich identifies these ceremonies with the cult of those _Matres_ or\r\n_Matronae_, corresponding with the Scandinavian _disar_, whom we seem\r\njustified in regarding as guardians and representatives of the dead.\r\nNor is there any particular difficulty in guessing at the nature of\r\nthe ceremonies referred to. Amongst all peoples the cult of the dead\r\nconsists in feeding them; and there is a long catena of evidence for\r\nthe persistent survival in the Germano-Keltic area of a Christmas and\r\nNew Year custom closely parallel to the _alfablót_ and _disablót_\r\nof the northern _jul_. When the household went to bed after the New\r\nYear revel, a portion of the banquet was left spread upon the table\r\nin the firm belief that during the night the ancestral spirits and\r\ntheir leaders would come and partake thereof. The practice, which was\r\nalso known on the Mediterranean, does not escape the animadversion\r\nof the ecclesiastical prohibitions. The earlier writers who speak of\r\nit, Jerome, Caesarius, Eligius, Boniface, Zacharias, the author of the\r\n_Homilia de Sacrilegiis_, if they give any explanation at all, treat it\r\nas a kind of charm[937]. The laden table, like the human over-eating\r\nand over-drinking, is to prognosticate or cause a year of plentiful\r\nfare. The preachers were more anxious to eradicate heathenism than\r\nto study its antiquities. Burchardus, however, had a touch of the\r\nanthropologist, and Burchardus says definitely that food, drink, and\r\nthree knives were laid on the Kalends table for the three _Parcae_,\r\nfigures of Roman mythology with whom the western _Matres_ or ‘weird\r\nsisters’ were identified[938]. Mediaeval notices confirm the statement\r\nof Burchardus. Martin of Amberg[939], the _Thesaurus Pauperum_[940] and\r\nthe Kloster Scheyern manuscript[941] make the recipient of the bounty\r\nFrau Perchte. In Alsso’s _Largum Sero_ it is for the heathen gods or\r\ndemons[942]; in _Dives and Pauper_ for ‘Atholde or Gobelyn[943].’ In\r\nmodern survivals it is still often Frau Perchte or the Perchten or\r\nPersteln for whom fragments of food are left; in other cases the custom\r\nhas taken on a Christian colouring, and the ancestors’ bit becomes the\r\nportion of _le bon Dieu_ or the Virgin or Christ or the _Magi_, and is\r\nactually given to _quêteurs_ or the poor[944].\r\n\r\nIt is the ancestors, perhaps, who are really had in mind when libations\r\nare made upon the Yule-log, an observance known to Martin of Braga in\r\nthe sixth century[945], and still in use in France[946]. Nor can it be\r\ndoubted that the healths drunk to them, and to the first of them, Odin,\r\nlived on in the St. John’s _minnes_, no less than in the St. Martin’s\r\n_minnes_, of Germany[947]. Apart from eating and drinking, numerous\r\nfolk-beliefs testify to the presence of the spirits of the dead on\r\nearth in the Twelve nights of Christmas. During these days, or some one\r\nof them, Frau Holle and Frau Perchte are abroad[948]. So is the ‘wild\r\nhunt[949].’ Dreams then dreamt come true[950], and children then born\r\nsee ghosts[951]. The werwolf, possessed by a human spirit, is to be\r\ndreaded[952]. The devil and his company dance in the Isle of Man[953]:\r\nin Brittany the _korrigans_ are unloosed, and the dolmens and menhirs\r\ndisclose their hidden treasures[954]. Marcellus in _Hamlet_ declares:\r\n\r\n    ‘Some say that ever ’gainst that season comes\r\n    Wherein our Saviour’s birth is celebrated,\r\n    The bird of dawning singeth all night long;\r\n    And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad;\r\n    The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,\r\n    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,\r\n    So hallow’d and so gracious is the time[955].’\r\n\r\nThe folk-lorist can only reply, ‘So have I heard, and do not in the\r\nleast believe it.’\r\n\r\nThe wanderings of Odin in the winter nights must be at the bottom of\r\nthe nursery myth that the Christian representatives of this divinity,\r\nSaints Martin and Nicholas (the Santa Claus of modern legend), are the\r\nnocturnal givers of _strenae_ to children. In Italy, the fairy Befana\r\n(Epiphania), an equivalent of Diana, has a similar function[956].\r\nIt was but a step to the actual representation of such personages\r\nfor the greater delight of the children. In Anspach the skin-clad\r\n_Pelzmarten_, in Holland St. Martin in bishop’s robes, make their\r\nrounds on St. Martin’s day with nuts, apples, and such-like[957].\r\nSt. Nicholas does the same on St. Nicholas’ day in Holland and\r\nAlsace-Lorraine, at Christmas in Germany[958]. The beneficent saints\r\nwere incorporated into the Kalends processions already described, which\r\nin the sixteenth-century Germany included two distinct groups, a dark\r\none of devils and beast-masks, terrible to children, and a white or\r\nkindly one, in which sometimes appeared the _Jesus-Kind_ himself[959].\r\nIt is perhaps a relic of the same merging which gives the German\r\nand Flemish St. Nicholas a black Moor as companion in his nightly\r\nperegrinations[960].\r\n\r\nBesides the customs which form part of the agricultural or the domestic\r\nobservances of the winter feasts, there are others which belong to\r\nthese in their quality as feasts of the New Year. To the primitive mind\r\nthe first night and day of the year are full of omen for the nights\r\nand days that follow. Their events must be observed as foretelling,\r\nnay more, they must as far as possible be regulated as determining,\r\nthose of the larger period. The eves and days of All Saints, Christmas,\r\nand the New Year itself, as well as in some degree the minor feasts,\r\npreserve in modern folk-lore this prophetic character. It is but an\r\nextension and systematization of the same notion that ascribes to each\r\nof the twelve days between Christmas and Epiphany a special influence\r\nupon one of the twelve months of the year[961]. This group of customs\r\nI can only touch most cursorily. The most interesting are those which,\r\nas I have just said, attempt to go beyond foretelling and to determine\r\nthe arrival of good fortune. Their method is symbolic. In order that\r\nthe house may be prosperous during the year, wealth during the critical\r\nday must flow in and not flow out. Hence the taboos which forbid the\r\ncarrying out in particular of those two central elements of early\r\ncivilization, fire[962] and iron[963]. Hence too the belief that a job\r\nof work begun on the feast day will succeed, which conflicts rather\r\ncuriously in practice with the universal rustic sentiment that to work\r\nor make others work on holidays is the act of a churl[964]. Nothing,\r\nagain, is more important to the welfare of the household during the\r\ncoming year than the character of the first visitor who may enter\r\nthe house on New Year’s day. The precise requirements of a ‘first\r\nfoot’ vary in different localities; but as a rule he must be a boy\r\nor man, and not a girl or woman, and he must be dark-haired and not\r\nsplay-footed[965]. An ingenious conjecture has connected the latter\r\nrequirements with the racial antagonism of the high-instepped dark\r\npre-Aryan to the flat-footed blonde or red-haired invading Kelt[966].\r\nA Bohemian parallel enables me to explain that of masculinity by the\r\nbelief in the influence of the sex of the ‘first foot’ upon that of\r\nthe cattle to be born during the year[967]. I regret to add that there\r\nare traces also of a requirement that the ‘first foot’ should not be\r\na priest, possibly because in that event the shadow of celibacy would\r\nmake any births at all improbable[968].\r\n\r\nSome of the New Year observances are but prophetic by second intention,\r\nhaving been originally elements of cult. An example is afforded by the\r\nall-night table for the leaders of the dead, which, as has been pointed\r\nout, was regarded by the Fathers who condemned it as merely a device,\r\nwith the festal banquet itself, to ensure carnal well-being. Another is\r\nthe habit of giving presents. This, though widespread, is apparently\r\nof Italian and not Germano-Keltic origin[969]. It has gone through\r\nthree phases. The original _strena_ played a part in the cult of the\r\nwood-goddess. It was a twig from a sacred tree and the channel of the\r\ndivine influence upon the personality of him who held or wore it. The\r\nlater _strena_ had clearly become an omen, as is shown by the tradition\r\nwhich required it to be honeyed or light-bearing or golden[970]. To-day\r\neven this notion may be said to have disappeared, and the Christmas-box\r\nor _étrenne_ is merely a token of goodwill, an amusement for children,\r\nor a blackmail levied by satellites.\r\n\r\nThe number of minor omens by which the curiosity, chiefly of\r\nwomen, strives on the winter nights to get a peep into futurity is\r\nlegion[971]. Many of them arise out of the ordinary incidents of the\r\nfestivities, the baking of the Christmas cakes[972], the roasting of\r\nthe nuts in the Hallow-e’en fire[973]. Some of them preserve ideas of\r\nextreme antiquity, as when a girl takes off her shift and sits naked\r\nin the belief that the vision of her future husband will restore it to\r\nher. Others are based upon the most naïve symbolism, as when the same\r\ngirl pulls a stick out of the wood-pile to see if her husband will be\r\nstraight or crooked[974]. But however diversified the methods, the\r\nobjects of the omens are few and unvarying. What will be the weather\r\nand what his crops? How shall he fare in love and the begetting of\r\nchildren? What are his chances of escaping for yet another year the\r\nsummons of the lord of shadows? Such are the simple questions to which\r\nthe rustic claims from his gods an answer.\r\n\r\nFinally, the instinct of play proved no less enduring in the\r\nGermano-Keltic winter feasts than in those of summer. The priestly\r\nprotests against the invasion of the churches by folk-dance and\r\nfolk-song apply just as much to Christmas as to any other festal\r\nperiod. It is, indeed, to Christmas that the monitory legend of the\r\ndancers of Kölbigk attaches itself. A similar pious narrative is that\r\nin the thirteenth-century _Bonum Universale de Apibus_ of Thomas of\r\nCantimpré, which tells how a devil made a famous song of St. Martin,\r\nand spread it abroad over France and Germany[975]. Yet a third is\r\nsolemnly retailed by a fifteenth-century English theologian, who\r\nprofesses to have known a man who once heard an indecent song at\r\nChristmas, and not long after died of a melancholy[976]. During the\r\nseventeenth century folk still danced and cried ‘Yole’ in Yorkshire\r\nchurches after the Christmas services[977]. Hopeless of abolishing\r\nsuch customs, the clergy tried to capture them. The Christmas crib\r\nwas rocked to the rhythms of a dance, and such great Latin hymns as\r\nthe _Hic iacet in cunabulis_ and the _Resonat in laudibus_ became\r\nthe parents of a long series of festival songs, half sacred, half\r\nprofane[978]. In Germany these were known as _Wiegenlieder_, in France\r\nas _noëls_, in England as carols; and the latter name makes it clear\r\nthat they are but a specialized development of those _caroles_ or\r\n_rondes_ which of all mediaeval _chansons_ came nearest to the type of\r\nGermano-Keltic folk-song. A single passage in a Byzantine writer gives\r\na tantalizing glimpse of such a folk-revel or _laiks_ at a much earlier\r\nstage. Constantine Porphyrogennetos describes amongst the New Year\r\nsports and ceremonies of the court of Byzantium in the tenth century\r\none known as τὸ Γοτθικόν. In this the courtiers were led by two ‘Goths’\r\nwearing skins and masks, and carrying staves and shields which they\r\nclashed together. An intricate dance took place about the hall, which\r\nnaturally recalls the sword-dance of western Europe. A song followed,\r\nof which the words are preserved. They are only partly intelligible,\r\nand seem to contain allusions to the sacrificial boar and to the\r\nGothic names of certain deities. From the fact that they are in Latin,\r\nthe scholars who have studied them infer that the Γοτθικόν drifted\r\nto Byzantium from the court of the great sixth-century Ostrogoth,\r\nTheodoric[979].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n                          THE FEAST OF FOOLS\r\n\r\n    [_Bibliographical Note._--The best recent accounts of the Feast\r\n    of Fools as a whole are those of G.

Grenier (1725-89) wrote an account of the Picardy\r\n    feasts, in his _Introduction à l’Histoire de Picardie_ (_Soc. des\r\n    Antiquaires de Picardie, Documens inédits_ (1856), iii. 352). But\r\n    many of his _probata_ remain in his _MSS. Picardie_ in the _Bibl.\r\n    Nat._ (cf. _Bibl. de l’École des Chartes_, xxxii. 275). Some of\r\n    this material was used by Rigollot for the book named above.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New Year customs, all too briefly summed up in the last chapter,\r\nare essentially folk customs. They belong to the ritual of that village\r\ncommunity whose primitive organization still, though obscurely,\r\nunderlies the complex society of western Europe. The remaining\r\nchapters of the present volume will deal with certain modifications\r\nand developments introduced into those customs by new social classes\r\nwhich gradually differentiated themselves during the Middle Ages\r\nfrom the village folk. The churchman, the _bourgeois_, the courtier,\r\ncelebrated the New Year, even as the peasant did. But they put their\r\nown temper into the observances; and it is worth while to accord a\r\nseparate treatment to the shapes which these took in such hands, and to\r\nthe resulting influence upon the dramatic conditions of the sixteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe discussion must begin with the somewhat startling New Year revels\r\nheld by the inferior clergy in mediaeval cathedrals and collegiate\r\nchurches, which may be known generically as the ‘Feast of Fools.’\r\nActually, the feast has different names in different localities. Most\r\ncommonly it is the _festum stultorum_, _fatuorum_ or _follorum_; but\r\nit is also called the _festum subdiaconorum_ from the highest of the\r\n_minores ordines_ who, originally at least, conducted it, and the\r\n_festum baculi_ from one of its most characteristic and symbolical\r\nceremonies; while it shares with certain other rites the suggestive\r\ntitle of the ‘Feast of Asses,’ _asinaria festa_.\r\n\r\nThe main area of the feast is in France, and it is in France that it\r\nmust first of all be considered. I do not find a clear notice of it\r\nuntil the end of the twelfth century[980]. It is mentioned, however,\r\nin the _Rationale Divinorum Officium_ (†1182-90) of Joannes Belethus,\r\nrector of Theology at Paris, and afterwards a cathedral dignitary\r\nat Amiens. ‘There are four _tripudia_’ Belethus tells us, ‘after\r\nChristmas. They are those of the deacons, priests, and choir-children,\r\nand finally that of the sub-deacons, _quod vocamus stultorum_, which is\r\nheld according to varying uses, on the Circumcision, or on Epiphany,\r\nor on the octave of Epiphany[981].’ Almost simultaneously the feast\r\ncan be traced in the cathedral of Notre-Dame at Paris, through an\r\nepigram written by one Leonius, a canon of the cathedral, to a friend\r\nwho was about to pay him a visit for the _festum baculi_ at the New\r\nYear[982]. The _baculus_ was the staff used by the precentor of a\r\ncathedral, or whoever might be conducting the choir in his place[983].\r\nIts function in the Feast of Fools may be illustrated from an order for\r\nthe reformation of the Notre-Dame ceremony issued in 1199. This order\r\nwas made by Eudes de Sully, bishop of Paris, together with the dean\r\nand other chapter officers[984]. It recites a mandate sent to them by\r\ncardinal Peter of Capua, then legate in France. The legate had been\r\ninformed of the improprieties and disorders, even to shedding of blood,\r\nwhich had given to the feast of the Circumcision in the cathedral\r\nthe appropriate name of the _festum fatuorum_. It was not a time for\r\nmirth, for the fourth crusade had failed, and Pope Innocent III was\r\npreaching the fifth. Nor could such _spurcitia_ be allowed in the\r\nsanctuary of God. The bishop and his fellows must at once take order\r\nfor the pruning of the feast. In obedience to the legate they decree as\r\nfollows. The bells for first Vespers on the eve of the Circumcision are\r\nto be rung in the usual way. There are to be no _chansons_, no masks,\r\nand no hearse lights, except on the iron wheels or on the _penna_ at\r\nthe will of the functionary who is to surrender the cope[985]. The lord\r\nof the feast is not to be led in procession or with singing to the\r\ncathedral or back to his house. He is to put on his cope in the choir,\r\nand with the precentor’s _baculus_ in his hand to start the singing of\r\nthe prose _Laetemur gaudiis_[986]. Vespers, Compline, Matins and Mass\r\nare to be sung in the usual festal manner. Certain small functions\r\nare reserved for the sub-deacons, and the Epistle at Mass is to be\r\n‘farced[987].’ At second Vespers _Laetemur gaudiis_ is to be again\r\nsung, and also _Laetabundus_[988]. Then comes an interesting direction.\r\n_Deposuit_ is to be sung where it occurs five times at most, and ‘if\r\nthe _baculus_ has been taken,’ Vespers are to be closed by the ordinary\r\nofficiant after a _Te Deum_. Throughout the feast canons and clerks\r\nare to remain properly in their stalls[989]. The abuses which it was\r\nintended to eliminate from the feast are implied rather than stated;\r\nbut the general character of the ceremony is clear. It consisted in the\r\npredominance throughout the services, for this one day in the year, of\r\nthe despised sub-deacons. Probably they had been accustomed to take the\r\ncanons’ stalls. This Eudes de Sully forbids, but even, in the feast\r\nas he left it the importance of the _dominus festi_, the sub-deacons’\r\nrepresentative, is marked by the transfer to him of the _baculus_,\r\nand with it the precentor’s control. _Deposuit potentes de sede:\r\net exaltavit humiles_ occurs in the _Magnificat_, which is sung at\r\nVespers; and the symbolical phrase, during which probably the _baculus_\r\nwas handed over from the _dominus_ of one year to the _dominus_ of the\r\nnext, became the keynote of the feast, and was hailed with inordinate\r\nrepetition by the delighted throng of inferior clergy[990].\r\n\r\nShortly after the Paris reformation a greater than Eudes de Sully and a\r\ngreater than Peter de Capua was stirred into action by the scandal of\r\nthe Feast of Fools and the cognate _tripudia_. In 1207, Pope Innocent\r\nIII issued a decretal to the archbishop and bishops of the province of\r\nGnesen in Poland, in which he called attention to the introduction,\r\nespecially during the Christmas feasts held by deacons, priests and\r\nsub-deacons, of _larvae_ or masks and _theatrales ludi_ into churches,\r\nand directed the discontinuance of the practice[991]. This decretal\r\nwas included as part of the permanent canon law in the _Decretales_ of\r\nGregory IX in 1234[992]. But some years before this it found support,\r\nso far as France was concerned, in a national council held at Paris by\r\nthe legate Robert de Courcon in 1212, at which both regular and secular\r\nclergy were directed to abstain from the _festa follorum, ubi baculus\r\naccipitur_[993].\r\n\r\nIt was now time for other cathedral chapters besides that of Paris\r\nto set their houses in order, and good fortune has preserved to us\r\na singular monument of the attempts which they made to do so. The\r\nso-called _Missel des Fous_ of Sens may be seen in the municipal\r\nlibrary of that city[994]. It is enshrined in a Byzantine ivory diptych\r\nof much older date than itself[995]. It is not a missal at all. It is\r\nheaded _Officium Circumcisionis in usum urbis Senonensis_, and is a\r\nchoir-book containing the words and music of the _Propria_ or special\r\nchants used in the Hours and Mass at the feast[996]. Local tradition\r\nat Sens, as far back as the early sixteenth century, ascribed the\r\ncompilation of this office to that very Petrus de Corbolio who was\r\nassociated with Eudes de Sully in the Paris reformation[997]. Pierre\r\nde Corbeil, whom scholastics called _doctor opinatissimus_ and his\r\nepitaph _flos et honor cleri_, had a varied ecclesiastical career.\r\nAs canon of Notre-Dame and reader in the Paris School of Theology he\r\ncounted amongst his pupils one no less distinguished than the future\r\nPope Innocent III himself. He became archdeacon of Evreux, coadjutor\r\nof Lincoln (a fact of some interest in connexion with the scanty\r\ntraces of the Feast of Fools in England), bishop of Cambrai, and\r\nfinally archbishop of Sens, where he died in 1222. There is really no\r\nreason to doubt his connexion with the _Officium_. The handwriting of\r\nthe manuscript and the character of the music are consistent with a\r\ndate early in the thirteenth century[998]. Elaborate and interpolated\r\noffices were then still in vogue, and the good bishop enjoyed some\r\nreputation for literature as well as for learning. He composed an\r\noffice for the Assumption, and is even suspected of contributions in\r\nhis youth to goliardic song[999]. It is unlikely that he actually wrote\r\nmuch of the text of the _Officium Circumcisionis_, very little of which\r\nis peculiar to Sens. But he may well have compiled or revised it for\r\nhis own cathedral, with the intention of pruning the abuses of the\r\nfeast; and, in so doing, he evidently admitted proses and _farsurae_\r\nwith a far more liberal hand than did Eudes de Sully. The whole office,\r\nwhich is quite serious and not in the least burlesque, well repays\r\nstudy. I can only dwell on those parts of it which throw light on the\r\ngeneral character of the celebration for which it was intended.\r\n\r\nThe first Vespers on the eve of the Circumcision are preceded by four\r\nlines sung _in ianuis ecclesiae_:\r\n\r\n    ‘Lux hodie, lux laetitiae, me iudice tristis\r\n    quisquis erit, removendus erit solemnibus istis,\r\n    sint hodie procul invidiae, procul omnia maesta,\r\n    laeta volunt, quicunque colunt asinaria festa.’\r\n\r\nThese lines are interesting, because they show that the\r\nthirteenth-century name for the feast at Sens was the _asinaria festa_,\r\nthe ‘Feast of the Ass.’ They are followed by what is popularly known\r\nas the ‘Prose of the Ass,’ but is headed in the manuscript _Conductas\r\nad tabulam_. A _conductus_ is a chant sung while the officiant is\r\nconducted from one station to another in the church[1000], and the\r\n_tabula_ is the _rota_ of names and duties _pro cantu et lectura_, with\r\nthe reading of which the Vespers began[1001]. The text of the Prose of\r\nthe Ass, as used at Sens and elsewhere, is given in an appendix[1002].\r\nNext come a trope and a farsed Alleluia, a long interpolation dividing\r\n‘Alle-’ and ‘-luia,’ and then another passage which has given a wrong\r\nimpression of the nature of the office:\r\n\r\n    ‘_Quatuor vel quinque in falso retro altare_:\r\n        Haec est clara dies, clararum clara dierum,\r\n        haec est festa dies, festarum festa dierum,\r\n        nobile nobilium rutilans diadema dierum.\r\n\r\n    _Duo vel tres in voce retro altare_:\r\n        Salve festa dies, toto venerabilis aevo,\r\n          qua Deus est ortus virginis ex utero[1003].’\r\n\r\nThe phrase _in falso_ does not really mean ‘out of tune.’ It means,\r\n‘with the harmonized accompaniment known as _en faux bourdon_’, and is\r\nopposed to _in voce_, ‘in unison[1004].’ The Vespers, with many further\r\ninterpolations, then continue, and after them follow Compline, Matins,\r\nLauds[1005], Prime, Tierce, the Mass, Sext, and second Vespers. These\r\nend with three further pieces of particular interest from our point of\r\nview. The first is a _Conductus ad Bacularium_, the name _Bacularius_\r\nbeing doubtless that given at Sens to the _dominus festi_[1006]. This\r\nopens in a marked festal strain:\r\n\r\n    ‘Novus annus hodie\r\n    monet nos laetitiae\r\n      laudes inchoare,\r\n    felix est principium,\r\n    finem cuius gaudium\r\n      solet terminare.\r\n    celebremus igitur\r\n      festum annuale,\r\n    quo peccati solvitur\r\n      vinculum mortale\r\n    et infirmis proponitur\r\n      poculum vitale;\r\n    adhuc sanat aegrotantes\r\n      hoc medicinale,\r\n    unde psallimus laetantes\r\n      ad memoriale.\r\n    ha, ha, ha,\r\n    qui vult vere psallere,\r\n    trino psallat munere,\r\n    corde, ore, opere\r\n      debet laborare,\r\n    ut sic Deum colere\r\n      possit et placare.’\r\n\r\nThe _Bacularius_ is then, one may assume, led out of the church, with\r\nthe _Conductus ad Poculum_, which begins,\r\n\r\n    ‘Kalendas Ianuarias\r\n    solemnes, Christe, facias,\r\n    et nos ad tuas nuptias\r\n    vocatus rex suscipias.’\r\n\r\nThe manuscript ends, so far as the Feast of the Circumcision is\r\nconcerned, with some _Versus ad Prandium_, to be sung in the refectory,\r\ntaken from a hymn of Prudentius[1007].\r\n\r\nThe Sens _Missel des Fous_ has been described again and again. Less\r\nwell known, however, is the very similar _Officium_ of Beauvais,\r\nand for the simple reason that although recent writers on the Feast\r\nof Fools have been aware of its existence, they have not been aware\r\nof its _habitat_. I have been fortunate enough to find it in the\r\nBritish Museum, and only regret that I am not sufficiently acquainted\r\nwith textual and musical palaeography to print it _in extenso_ as\r\nan appendix to this chapter[1008]. The date of the manuscript is\r\nprobably 1227-34[1009]. Like that of Sens it contains the _Propria_\r\nfor the Feast of the Circumcision from Vespers to Vespers. Unluckily,\r\nthere is a lacuna of several pages in the middle[1010]. The office\r\nresembles that of Sens in general character, but is much longer.\r\nThere are two lines of opening rubric, of which all that remains\r\nlegible is ... _medio stantes incipit cantor_. Then comes the quatrain\r\n_Lux hodie_ similarly used at Sens, but with the notable variant of\r\n_praesentia festa_ for _asinaria festa_. Then, under the rubric, also\r\nbarely legible, _Conductus, quando asinus adducitur_[1011], comes\r\nthe ‘Prose of the Ass.’ At the end of Lauds is the following rubric:\r\n_Postea omnes eant ante ianuas ecclesiae clausas. Et quatuor stent\r\nforis tenentes singli urnas vino plenas cum cyfis vitreis. Quorum unus\r\ncanonicus incipiat_ Kalendas Ianuarias. _Tunc aperiantur ianuae._ Here\r\ncomes the lacuna in the manuscript, which begins again in the Mass.\r\nShortly before the prayer for the pope is a rubric _Quod dicitur, ubi\r\napponatur baculus_, which appears to be a direction for a ceremony\r\nnot fully described in the _Officium_. The ‘Prose of the Ass’ occurs\r\na second time as the _Conductus Subdiaconi ad Epistolam_, and on this\r\noccasion the musical accompaniment is harmonized in three parts[1012].\r\nI can find nothing about a _Bacularius_ at second Vespers, but the\r\noffice ends with a series of _conductus_ and hymns, some of which are\r\nalso harmonized in parts. The _Officium_ is followed in the manuscript\r\nby a Latin cloister play of _Daniel_[1013].\r\n\r\nAn earlier manuscript than that just described was formerly preserved\r\nin the Beauvais cathedral library. It dated from 1160-80[1014]. It\r\nwas known to Pierre Louvet, the seventeenth-century historian of\r\nBeauvais[1015], and apparently to Dom Grenier, who died in 1789[1016].\r\nAccording to Grenier’s account it must have closely resembled that in\r\nthe British Museum.\r\n\r\n‘Aux premières vêpres, le chantre commençait par entonner au milieu\r\nde la nef: _Lux hodie, lux laetitiae_, etc.... À laudes rien de\r\nparticulier que le _Benedictus_ et son répons farcis. Les laudes\r\nfinies on sortait de l’église pour aller trouver l’âne qui attendait\r\nà la grande porte. Elle était fermée. Là, chacun des chanoines s’y\r\ntrouvant la bouteille et le verre à la main, le chantre entonnait\r\nla prose: _Kalendas ianuarias solemne Christe facias_. Voici ce que\r\nporte l’ancien cérémonial: _dominus cantor et canonici ante ianuas\r\necclesiae clausas stent foris tenentes singuli urnas vini plenas cum\r\ncyfis vitreis, quorum unus cantor incipiat: Kalendas ianuarias_, etc.\r\nLes battants de la porte ouverts, on introduisait l’âne dans l’église,\r\nen chantant la prose: _Orientis partibus_. Ici est une lacune dans le\r\nmanuscrit jusque vers le milieu du _Gloria in excelsis_.... On chantait\r\nla litanie: _Christus vincit_, _Christus regnat_, dans laquelle on\r\npriait pour le pape Alexandre III, pour Henri de France, évêque de\r\nBeauvais, pour le roi Louis VII et pour Alixe ou Adèle de Champagne\r\nqui était devenue reine en 1160; par quoi on peut juger de l’antiquité\r\nde ce cérémonial. L’Évangile était précédé d’une prose et suivi d’une\r\nautre. Il est marqué dans le cérémonial de cinq cents ans que les\r\nencensements du jour de cette fête se feront avec le boudin et la\r\nsaucisse: _hac die incensabitur cum boudino et saucita_.’\r\n\r\nDom Grenier gives as the authority for his last sentence, not the\r\n_Officium_, but the _Glossary_ of Ducange, or rather the additions\r\nthereto made by certain Benedictine editors in 1733-6. They quote the\r\npudding and sausage rubric together with that as to the drinking-bout,\r\nwhich occurs in both the _Officia_, as from a Beauvais manuscript. This\r\nthey describe as a _codex ann. circiter_ 500[1017]. It seems probable\r\nthat this was not an _Officium_ at all, but something of the nature of\r\na Processional, and that it was identical with the _codex 500 annorum_\r\nfrom which the same Benedictines derived their amazing account of a\r\nBeauvais ceremony which took place not on January 1 but on January\r\n14[1018]. A pretty girl, with a child in her arms, was set upon an ass,\r\nto represent the Flight into Egypt. There was a procession from the\r\ncathedral to the church of St. Stephen. The ass and its riders were\r\nstationed on the gospel side of the altar. A solemn mass was sung, in\r\nwhich _Introit_, _Kyrie_, _Gloria_ and _Credo_ ended with a bray. To\r\ncrown all, the rubrics direct that the celebrant, instead of saying\r\n_Ite_, _missa est_, shall bray three times (_ter hinhannabit_) and\r\nthat the people shall respond in similar fashion. At this ceremony\r\nalso the ‘Prose of the Ass’ was used, and the version preserved in the\r\n_Glossary_ is longer and more ludicrous than that of either the Sens or\r\nthe Beauvais _Officium_.\r\n\r\nOn a review of all the facts it would seem that the Beauvais documents\r\nrepresent a stage of the feast unaffected by any such reform as that\r\ncarried out by Pierre de Corbeil at Sens. And the nature of that\r\nreform is fairly clear. Pierre de Corbeil provided a text of the\r\n_Officium_ based either on that of Beauvais or on an earlier version\r\nalready existing at Sens. He probably added very little of his own,\r\nfor the Sens manuscript only contains a few short passages not to\r\nbe found in that of Beauvais. And as the twelfth-century Beauvais\r\nmanuscript seems to have closely resembled the thirteenth-century one\r\nstill extant, Beauvais cannot well have borrowed from him. At the same\r\ntime he doubtless suppressed whatever burlesque ceremonies, similar\r\nto the Beauvais drinking-bout in the porch and censing with pudding\r\nand sausage, may have been in use at Sens. One of these was possibly\r\nthe actual introduction of an ass into the church. But it must be\r\nremembered that the most extravagant of such ceremonies would not be\r\nlikely at either place to get into the formal service-books[1019].\r\nAs the Sens _Officium_ only includes the actual service of January 1\r\nitself, it is impossible to compare the way in which the semi-dramatic\r\nextension of the feast was treated in the two neighbouring cathedrals.\r\nBut Sens probably had this extension, for as late as 1634 there was an\r\nannual procession, in which the leading figures were the Virgin Mary\r\nmounted on an ass and a _cortège_ of the twelve Apostles. This did not,\r\nhowever, at that time take part in the Mass[1020].\r\n\r\nThe full records of the Feast of Fools at Sens do not begin until the\r\nbest part of a century after the probable date of its _Officium_. But\r\none isolated notice breaks the interval, and shows that the efforts of\r\nPierre de Corbeil were not for long successful in purging the revel of\r\nits abuses. This is a letter written to the chapter in 1245 by Odo,\r\ncardinal of Tusculum, who was then papal legate in France. He calls\r\nattention to the _antiqua ludibria_ of the feasts of Christmas week and\r\nof the Circumcision, and requires these to be celebrated, not _iuxta\r\npristinum modum_, but with the proper ecclesiastical ceremonies. He\r\nspecifically reprobates the use of unclerical dress and the wearing of\r\nwreaths of flowers[1021].\r\n\r\nA little later in date than either the Sens or the Beauvais _Officium_\r\nis a _Ritual_ of St. Omer, which throws some light on the Feast of\r\nFools as it was celebrated in the northern town on the day of the\r\nCircumcision about 1264. It was the feast of the vicars and the choir.\r\nA ‘bishop’ and a ‘dean’ of Fools took part in the services. The latter\r\nwas censed in burlesque fashion, and the whole office was recited at\r\nthe pitch of the voice, and even with howls. There cannot have been\r\nmuch of a reformation here[1022].\r\n\r\nA few other scattered notices of thirteenth-century Feasts of Fools may\r\nbe gathered together. The _Roman de Renard_ is witness to the existence\r\nof such a feast, with _jeux_ and tippling, at Bayeux, about 1200[1023].\r\nAt Autun, the chapter forbade the _baculus anni novi_ in 1230[1024].\r\nFeasts of Fools on Innocents’ and New Year’s days are forbidden by the\r\nstatutes of Nevers cathedral in 1246[1025]. At Romans, in Dauphiné, an\r\nagreement was come to in 1274 between the chapter, the archbishop of\r\nVienne and the municipal authorities, that the choice of an abbot by\r\nthe cathedral clerks known as _esclaffardi_ should cease, on account\r\nof the disturbances and scandals to which it had given rise[1026]. The\r\nearliest mention of the feast at Laon is about 1280[1027]; while it is\r\nprovided for as the sub-deacons’ feast by an Amiens _Ordinarium_ of\r\n1291[1028]. Nor are the ecclesiastical writers oblivious of it. William\r\nof Auxerre opens an era of learned speculation in his _De Officiis\r\nEcclesiasticis_, by explaining it as a Christian substitute for the\r\n_Parentalia_ of the pagans[1029]. Towards the end of the century,\r\nDurandus, bishop of Mende, who drew upon both William of Auxerre and\r\nBelethus for his _Rationale Divinorum Officiorum_, gave an account of\r\nit which agrees closely with that of Belethus[1030]. Neither William of\r\nAuxerre nor Durandus shows himself hostile to the Feast of Fools. Its\r\nabuses are, however, condemned in more than one contemporary collection\r\nof sermons[1031].\r\n\r\nWith the fourteenth century the records of the Feast of Fools\r\nbecome more frequent. In particular, the account-books of the\r\nchapter of Sens throw some light on the organization of the feast\r\nin that cathedral[1032]. The _Compotus Camerarii_ has, from 1345\r\nonwards, a yearly entry _pro vino praesentato vicariis ecclesiae die\r\nCircumcisionis Domini_. Sometimes the formula is varied to _die festi\r\nfatuorum_. In course of time the whole expenses of the feast come\r\nto be a charge on the chapter, and in particular, it would appear,\r\nupon the sub-deacon canons[1033]. In 1376 is mentioned, for the first\r\ntime, the _dominus festi_, to whom under the title of _precentor et\r\nprovisor festi stultorum_ a payment is made. The _Compotus Nemorum_\r\nshows that by 1374 a prebend in the chapter woods had been appropriated\r\nto the vicars _pro festo fatuorum_. Similar entries occur to the\r\nend of the fourteenth century and during the first quarter of the\r\nfifteenth[1034]. Then came the war to disturb everything, and from\r\n1420 the account-books rarely show any traces of the feast. Nor were\r\ncivil commotions alone against it. As in the twelfth and thirteenth\r\ncenturies, so in the fourteenth and fifteenth the abuses which clung\r\nabout the Feasts of Fools rendered them everywhere a mark for the\r\neloquence of ecclesiastical reformers. About 1400 the famous theologian\r\nand rector of Paris University, Jean-Charlier de Gerson, put himself at\r\nthe head of a crusade against the _ritus ille impiissimus et insanus\r\nqui regnat per totam Franciam_, and denounced it roundly in sermons and\r\n_conclusiones_. The indecencies of the feast, he declares, would shame\r\na kitchen or a tavern. The chapters will do nothing to stop them, and\r\nif the bishops protest, they are flouted and defied. The scandal can\r\nonly be ended by the interposition of royal authority[1035]. According\r\nto Gerson, Charles the Sixth did on one occasion issue letters against\r\nthe feast; and the view of the reformers found support in the diocesan\r\ncouncil of Langres in 1404[1036], and the provincial council of Tours,\r\nheld at Nantes in 1431[1037]. It was a more serious matter when, some\r\nyears after Gerson’s death, the great council of Basle included a\r\nprohibition of the feast in its reformatory decrees of 1435[1038].\r\nBy the Pragmatic Sanction issued by Charles VII at the national\r\ncouncil of Bourges in 1438, these decrees became ecclesiastical law in\r\nFrance[1039], and it was competent for the _Parlements_ to put them\r\ninto execution[1040]. But the chapters were obstinate; the feasts\r\nwere popular, not only with the inferior clergy themselves, but with\r\nthe _spectacle_-loving _bourgeois_ of the cathedral towns; and it\r\nwas only gradually that they died out during the course of the next\r\ncentury and a half. The failure of the Pragmatic Sanction to secure\r\nimmediate obedience in this matter roused the University of Paris,\r\nstill possessed with the spirit of Gerson, to fresh action. On March\r\n12, 1445, the Faculty of Theology, acting through its dean, Eustace\r\nde Mesnil, addressed to the bishops and chapters of France a letter\r\nwhich, from the minuteness of its indictment, is perhaps the most\r\ncurious of the many curious documents concerning the feast[1041]. It\r\nconsists of a preamble and no less than fourteen _conclusiones_, some\r\nof which are further complicated by _qualificationes_. The preamble\r\nsets forth the facts concerning the _festum fatuorum_. It has its clear\r\norigin, say the theologians, in the rites of paganism, amongst which\r\nthis Janus-worship of the Kalends has alone been allowed to survive.\r\nThey then describe the customs of the feast in a passage which I must\r\ntranslate:\r\n\r\n‘Priests and clerks may be seen wearing masks and monstrous visages at\r\nthe hours of office. They dance in the choir dressed as women, panders\r\nor minstrels. They sing wanton songs. They eat black puddings at the\r\nhorn of the altar while the celebrant is saying mass. They play at dice\r\nthere. They cense with stinking smoke from the soles of old shoes. They\r\nrun and leap through the church, without a blush at their own shame.\r\nFinally they drive about the town and its theatres in shabby traps and\r\ncarts, and rouse the laughter of their fellows and the bystanders in\r\ninfamous performances, with indecent gestures and verses scurrilous and\r\nunchaste[1042].’\r\n\r\nThere follows a refutation of the argument that such _ludi_ are but\r\nthe relaxation of the bent bow in a fashion sanctioned by antiquity.\r\nOn the contrary, they are due to original sin, and the snares of\r\ndevils. The bishops are besought to follow the example of St. Paul and\r\nSt. Augustine, of bishops Martin, Hilarius, Chrysostom, Nicholas and\r\nGermanus of Auxerre, all of whom made war on sacrilegious practices,\r\nnot to speak of the canons of popes and general councils, and to stamp\r\nout the _ludibria_. It rests with them, for the clergy will not be so\r\nbesotted as to face the Inquisition and the secular arm[1043].\r\n\r\nThe _conclusiones_ thus introduced yield a few further data as to the\r\nceremonies of the feast. It seems to be indifferently called _festum\r\nstultorum_ and _festum fatuorum_. It takes place in cathedrals and\r\ncollegiate churches, on Innocents’ day, on St. Stephen’s, on the\r\nCircumcision, or on other dates. ‘Bishops’ or ‘archbishops’ of Fools\r\nare chosen, who wear mitres and pastoral staffs, and have crosses borne\r\nbefore them, as if they were on visitation. They take the Office, and\r\ngive Benedictions to the readers of the lessons at Matins, and to\r\nthe congregations. In exempt churches, subject only to the Holy See,\r\na ‘pope’ of Fools is naturally chosen instead of a ‘bishop’ or an\r\n‘archbishop.’ The clergy wear the garments of the laity or of fools,\r\nand the laity put on priestly or monastic robes. _Ludi theatrales_ and\r\n_personagiorum ludi_ are performed.\r\n\r\nThe manifesto of the Theological Faculty helped in at least one town\r\nto bring matters to a crisis. At Troyes the Feast of Fools appears to\r\nhave been celebrated on the Circumcision in the three great collegiate\r\nchurches of St. Peter, St. Stephen, and St. Urban, and on Epiphany in\r\nthe abbey of St. Loup. The earliest records are from St. Peter’s. In\r\n1372 the chapter forbade the vicars to celebrate the feast without\r\nleave. In 1380 and 1381 there are significant entries of payments for\r\ndamage done: in the former year Marie-la-Folle broke a _candelabrum_;\r\nin the latter a cross had to be repaired and gilded. In 1436, the year\r\nafter the council of Basle, leave was given to hold the feast without\r\nirreverence. In 1439, the year after the Pragmatic Sanction, it was\r\nforbidden. In 1443, it was again permitted. But it must be outside\r\nthe church. The ‘archbishop’ might wear a rochet, but the supper must\r\ntake place in the house of one of the canons, and not at a tavern. The\r\nexperiment was not altogether a success, for a canon had to be fined\r\ntwenty sous _pour les grandes sottises et les gestes extravagants\r\nqu’il s’était permis à la fête des fols_[1044]. Towards the end of\r\n1444, when it was proposed to renew the feast, the bishop of Troyes,\r\nJean Leguisé, intervened. The clergy of St. Peter’s were apparently\r\nwilling to submit, but those of St. Stephen’s stood out. They told the\r\nbishop that they were exempt from his jurisdiction, and subject only to\r\nhis metropolitan, the archbishop of Sens; and they held an elaborate\r\nrevel with even more than the usual insolence and riot. On the Sunday\r\nbefore Christmas they publicly consecrated their ‘archbishop’ in the\r\nmost public place of the town with a _jeu de personnages_ called _le\r\njeu du sacre de leur arcevesque_, which was a burlesque of the _saint\r\nmistère de consécration pontificale_. The feast itself took place in\r\nSt. Stephen’s Church. The vicar who was chosen ‘archbishop’ performed\r\nthe service on the eve and day of the Circumcision _in pontificalibus_,\r\ngave the Benediction to the people, and went in procession through the\r\ntown. Finally, on Sunday, January 3, the clergy of all three churches\r\njoined in another _jeu de personnages_, in which, under the names\r\nof _Hypocrisie_, _Faintise_ and _Faux-semblant_, the bishop and two\r\ncanons who had been most active in opposing the feast, were held up\r\nto ridicule. Jean Leguisé was not a man to be defied with impunity.\r\nOn January 23 he wrote a letter to the archbishop of Sens, Louis de\r\nMelun, calling his attention to the fact that the rebellious clerks had\r\nclaimed his authority for their action. He also lodged a complaint with\r\nthe king himself, and probably incited the Faculty of Theology at Paris\r\nto back him up with the protest already described. The upshot of it all\r\nwas a sharp letter from Charles VII to the _bailly_ and _prévost_ of\r\nTroyes, setting forth what had taken place, and requiring them to see\r\nthat no repetition of the scandalous _jeux_ was allowed[1045]. Shortly\r\nafterwards the chapter of St. Peter’s sent for their _Ordinarium_, and\r\nsolemnly erased all that was derogatory to religion and the good name\r\nof the clergy in the directions for the feast. What the chapter of St.\r\nStephen’s did, we do not know. The canons mainly to blame had already\r\napologized to the bishop. Probably it was thought best to say nothing,\r\nand let it blow over. At any rate, it is interesting to note that in\r\n1595, a century and a half later, St. Stephen’s was still electing its\r\n_archevesque des saulx_, and that _droits_ were paid on account of the\r\nvicars’ feast until all _droits_ tumbled in 1789[1046].\r\n\r\nThe proceedings at Troyes seem to have reacted upon the feast at Sens.\r\nIn December, 1444, the chapter had issued an elaborate order for the\r\nregulation of the ceremony, in which they somewhat pointedly avoided\r\nany reference to the council of Basle or the Pragmatic Sanction, and\r\ncited only the legatine statute of Odo of Tusculum in 1245. The order\r\nrequires that divine service shall be devoutly and decently performed,\r\n_prout iacet in libro ipsius servitii_. By this is doubtless meant the\r\n_Officium_ already described. There must be no mockery or impropriety,\r\nno unclerical costume, no dissonant singing. Then comes what,\r\nconsidering that this is a reform, appears a sufficiently remarkable\r\ndirection. Not more than three buckets of water at most must be poured\r\nover the _precentor stultorum_ at Vespers. The custom of ducking\r\non St. John’s eve, apparently the occasion when the precentor was\r\nelected, is also pruned, and a final clause provides that if nobody’s\r\nrights are infringed the _stulti_ may do what they like outside the\r\nchurch[1047]. Under these straitened conditions the feast was probably\r\nheld in 1445. There was, however, the archbishop as well as the chapter\r\nto be reckoned with. It was difficult for Louis de Melun, after the\r\ndirect appeal made to him by his suffragan at Troyes, to avoid taking\r\nsome action, and in certain statutes promulgated in November, 1445,\r\nhe required the suppression of the whole _consuetudo_ and ordered the\r\ndirections for it to be erased from the chant-books[1048]. There is\r\nnow no mention of the feast until 1486, from which date an occasional\r\npayment for _la feste du premier jour de l’an_ begins to appear again\r\nin the chapter account-books[1049]. In 1511, the _servitium divinum_\r\nafter the old custom is back in the church. But the chapter draws\r\na distinction between the _servitium_ and the _festum stultorum_,\r\nwhich is forbidden. The performance of _jeux de personnages_ and the\r\npublic shaving of the precentor’s beard on a stage are especially\r\nreprobated[1050]. The _servitium_ was again allowed in 1514, 1516,\r\n1517, and in 1520 with a provision that the _lucerna precentoris\r\nfatuorum_ must not be brought into the church[1051]. In 1522, both\r\n_servitium_ and _festum_ were forbidden on account of the war with\r\nSpain; the shaving of the precentor and the ceremony of his election\r\non the feast of St. John the Evangelist again coming in for express\r\nprohibition[1052]. In 1523 the _servitium_ was allowed upon a protest\r\nby the vicars, but only with the strict exclusion of the popular\r\nelements[1053]. In 1524 even the _servitium_ was withheld, and though\r\nsanctioned again in 1535, 1539 and 1543, it was finally suppressed in\r\n1547[1054]. Some feast, however, would still seem to have been held,\r\nprobably outside the church, until 1614[1055], and even as late as 1634\r\nthere was a trace of it in the annual procession of the Virgin Mary and\r\nthe Apostles, already referred to.\r\n\r\nThis later history of the feast at Sens is fairly typical, as the\r\nfollowing chapter will show, of what took place all over France.\r\nThe chapters by no means showed themselves universally willing to\r\nsubmit to the decree promulgated in the Pragmatic Sanction. In many of\r\nthem the struggle between the conservative and the reforming parties\r\nwas spread over a number of years. Councils, national, provincial\r\nand diocesan, continued to find it necessary to condemn the feast,\r\nmentioning it either by name or in a common category with other _ludi_,\r\n_spectacula_, _choreae_, _tripudia_ and _larvationes_[1056]. In one\r\nor two instances the authority of the _Parlements_ was invoked. But\r\nin the majority of cases the feast either gradually disappeared, or\r\nelse passed, first from the churches into the streets, and then from\r\nthe clerks to the _bourgeois_, often to receive a new life under quite\r\naltered circumstances at the hands of some witty and popular _compagnie\r\ndes fous_[1057].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n                   THE FEAST OF FOOLS (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the Feast of Fools has been so imperfectly written,\r\nthat it is perhaps worth while to bring together the records of its\r\noccurrence, elsewhere than in Troyes and Sens, from the fourteenth\r\ncentury onwards. They could probably be somewhat increased by an\r\nexhaustive research amongst French local histories, archives, and the\r\ntransactions of learned societies. Of the feast in Notre-Dame at Paris\r\nnothing is heard after the reformation carried out in 1198 by Eudes de\r\nSully[1058]. The _bourgeois_ of Tournai were, indeed, able to quote a\r\nParis precedent for the feast of their own city in 1499; but this may\r\nhave been merely the feast of some minor collegiate body, such as that\r\nfounded in 1303 by cardinal Le Moine[1059]; or of the scholars of the\r\nUniversity, or of the _compagnie joyeuse_ of the _Enfants-sans-Souci_.\r\nAt Beauvais, too, there are only the faintest traces of the feast\r\noutside the actual twelfth-and thirteenth-century service-books[1060].\r\nBut there are several other towns in the provinces immediately north\r\nand east of the capital, Île de France, Picardy, Champagne, where it\r\nis recorded. The provision made for it in the Amiens _Ordinarium_ of\r\n1291 has been already quoted. Shortly after this, bishop William de\r\nMacon, who died in 1303, left his own _pontificalia_ for the use of\r\nthe ‘bishop of Fools[1061].’ When, however, the feast reappears in the\r\nfifteenth century the _dominus festi_ is no longer a ‘bishop,’ but a\r\n‘pope.’ In 1438 there was an endowment consisting of a share in the\r\nprofits of some lead left by one John le Caron, who had himself been\r\n‘pope[1062].’ In 1520 the feast was held, but no bells were to be\r\njangled[1063]. It was repeated in 1538. Later in the year the customary\r\nelection of the ‘pope’ on the anniversary of Easter was forbidden, but\r\nthe canons afterwards repented of their severity[1064]. In 1540 the\r\nchapter paid a subsidy towards the amusements of the ‘pope’ and his\r\n‘cardinals’ on the Sunday called _brioris_[1065]. In 1548 the feast\r\nwas suppressed[1066]. At Noyon the vicars chose a ‘king of Fools’ on\r\nEpiphany eve. The custom is mentioned in 1366 as ‘_le gieu des roys_.’\r\nBy 1419 it was forbidden, and canon John de Gribauval was punished\r\nfor an attempt to renew it by taking the sceptre off the high altar\r\nat Compline on Epiphany. In 1497, 1499, and 1505 it was permitted\r\nagain, with certain restrictions. The cavalcade must be over before\r\nNones; there must be no licentious or scurrilous _chansons_, no dance\r\nbefore the great doors; the ‘king’ must wear ecclesiastical dress in\r\nthe choir. In 1520, however, he was allowed to wear his crown _more\r\nantiquo_. The feast finally perished in 1721, owing to _la cherté des\r\nvivres_[1067]. At Soissons, the feast was held on January 1, with\r\nmasquing[1068]. At Senlis, the _dominus festi_ was a ‘pope.’ In 1403\r\nthere was much division of opinion amongst the chapter as to the\r\ncontinuance of the feast, and it was finally decided that it must take\r\nplace outside the church. In 1523 it came to an end. The vicars of the\r\nchapter of Saint-Rieul had in 1501 their separate feast on January 1,\r\nwith a ‘prelate of Fools’ and _jeux_ in the churchyard[1069]. From\r\nLaon fuller records are available[1070]. A ‘patriarch of Fools’ was\r\nchosen with his ‘consorts’ on Epiphany eve after Prime, by the vicars,\r\nchaplains and choir-clerks. There was a cavalcade through the city\r\nand a procession called the _Rabardiaux_, of which the nature is not\r\nstated[1071]. The chapter bore the expenses of the banquet and the\r\nmasks. The first notice is about 1280. In 1307 one Pierre Caput was\r\n‘patriarch.’ In 1454 the bishop upheld the feast against the dean, but\r\nit was decided that it should take place outside the church. A similar\r\nregulation was made in 1455, 1456, 1459. In 1462 the _servitium_ was\r\nallowed, and the _jeu_ was to be submitted to censorship. In 1464 and\r\n1465 mysteries were acted before the _Rabardiaux_. In 1486 the _jeu_\r\nwas given before the church of St.-Martin-au-Parvis. In 1490 the\r\n_jeux_ and cavalcade were forbidden, and the banquet only allowed.\r\nIn 1500 a chaplain, Jean Hubreland, was fined for not taking part in\r\nthe ceremony. In 1518 the worse fate of imprisonment befell Albert\r\nGosselin, another chaplain, who flung fire from above the porch upon\r\nthe ‘patriarch’ and his ‘consorts.’ By 1521 the _servitium_ seems to\r\nhave been conducted by the _curés_ of the Laon churches, and the vicars\r\nand chaplains merely assisted. The expense now fell on the _curés_,\r\nand the chapter subsidy was cut down. In 1522 and 1525 the perquisites\r\nof the ‘patriarch’ were still further reduced by the refusal of a\r\ndonation from the chapter as well as of the fines formerly imposed on\r\nabsentees. In 1527 a protest of Laurent Brayart, ‘patriarch,’ demanding\r\neither leave to celebrate the feast _more antiquo_ or a dispensation\r\nfrom assisting at the election of his successor, was referred to\r\nthe ex-‘patriarch.’ In this same year canons, vicars, chaplains and\r\n_habitués_ of the cathedral were forbidden to appear at the farces of\r\nthe _fête des ânes_[1072]. In 1531 the ‘patriarch’ Théobald Bucquet,\r\nrecovered the right to play comedies and _jeux_ and to take the\r\nabsentee fines; but in 1541 Absalon Bourgeois was refused leave _pour\r\nfaire semblant de dire la messe à liesse_. The feast was cut down to\r\nthe bare election of the ‘patriarch’ in 1560, and seems to have passed\r\ninto the hands of a _confrérie_; all that was retained in the cathedral\r\nbeing the _Primes folles_ on Epiphany eve, in which the laity occupied\r\nthe high stalls, and all present wore crowns of green leaves.\r\n\r\nAt Rheims, a Feast of Fools in 1490 was the occasion for a satirical\r\nattack by the vicars and choir-boys on the fashion of the hoods\r\nworn by the _bourgeoises_. This led to reprisals in the form of\r\nsome anti-ecclesiastical farces played on the following _dimanche\r\ndes Brandons_ by the law clerks of the Rheims _Basoche_[1073]. At\r\nChâlons-sur-Marne a detailed and curious account is preserved of\r\nthe way in which the Feast of Fools was celebrated in 1570[1074].\r\nIt took place on St. Stephen’s day. The chapter provided a banquet\r\non a theatre in front of the great porch. To this the ‘bishop of\r\nFools’ was conducted in procession from the _maîtrise des fous_,\r\nwith bells and music upon a gaily trapped ass. He was then vested\r\nin cope, mitre, pectoral cross, gloves and crozier, and enjoyed a\r\nbanquet with the canons who formed his ‘household.’ Meanwhile some of\r\nthe inferior clergy entered the cathedral, sang gibberish, grimaced\r\nand made contortions. After the banquet, Vespers were precipitately\r\nsung, followed by a _motet_[1075]. Then came a musical cavalcade round\r\nthe cathedral and through the streets. A game of _la paume_ took\r\nplace in the market; then dancing and further cavalcades. Finally\r\na band gathered before the cathedral, howled and clanged kettles\r\nand saucepans, while the bells were rung and the clergy appeared in\r\ngrotesque costumes.\r\n\r\nFlanders also had its Feasts of Fools. That of St. Omer, which existed\r\nin the twelfth century, lasted to the sixteenth[1076]. An attempt was\r\nmade to stop it in 1407, when the chapter forbade any one to take the\r\nname of ‘bishop’ or ‘abbot’ of Fools. But Seraphin Cotinet was ‘bishop’\r\nof Fools in 1431, and led the _gaude_ on St. Nicholas’ eve[1077].\r\nThe ‘bishop’ is again mentioned in 1490, but in 1515 the feast was\r\nsuppressed by Francis de Melun, bishop of Arras and provost of St.\r\nOmer[1078]. Some payments made by the chapter of Béthune in 1445 and\r\n1474 leave it doubtful how far the feast was really established in\r\nthat cathedral[1079]. At Lille the feast was forbidden by the chapter\r\nstatutes of 1323 and 1328[1080]. But at the end of the fourteenth\r\ncentury it was in full swing, lasting under its ‘bishop’ or ‘prelate’\r\nfrom the vigil to the octave of Epiphany. Amongst the payments made\r\nby the chapter on account of it is one to replace a tin can (_kanne\r\nstannee_) lost at the banquet. The ‘bishop’ was chosen, as elsewhere,\r\nby the inferior clergy of the cathedral; but he also stood in some\r\nrelation to the municipality of Lille, and superintended the miracle\r\nplays performed at the procession of the Holy Sacrament and upon other\r\noccasions. In 1393 he received a payment from the duke of Burgundy for\r\nthe _fête_ of the _Trois Rois_. Municipal subsidies were paid to him\r\nin the fifteenth century; he collected additional funds from private\r\nsources and offered prizes, by proclamation _soubz nostre seel de\r\nfatuité_, for pageants and _histoires de la Sainte Escripture_; was, in\r\nfact, a sort of Master of the Revels for Lille. He was active in 1468,\r\nbut in 1469 the town itself gave the prizes, in place _de l’evesque des\r\nfolz, qui à présent est rué jus_. The chapter accounts show that he was\r\nreappointed in 1485 _hoc anno, de gratia speciali_. In 1492 and 1493\r\nthe chapter payments were not to him but _sociis domus clericorum_,\r\nand from this year onwards he appears neither in the chapter accounts\r\nnor in those of the municipality[1081]. Nevertheless, he did not\r\nyet cease to exist, for a statute was passed by the chapter for his\r\nextinction, together with that of the _ludus, quem Deposuit vocant_, in\r\n1531[1082]. Five years before this the canons and vicars were still\r\nwearing masks and playing comedies in public[1083]. The history of the\r\nfeast at Tournai is only known to me through certain legal proceedings\r\nwhich took place before the _Parlement_ of Paris in 1499. It appears\r\nthat the young _bourgeois_ of Tournai were accustomed to require the\r\nvicars of Notre-Dame to choose an _évesque des sotz_ from amongst\r\nthemselves on Innocents’ day. In 1489 they took one Matthieu de Porta\r\nand insulted him in the church itself. The chapter brought an action\r\nin the local court against the _prévost et jurez_ of the town; and in\r\nthe meantime obtained provisional letters inhibitory from Charles VIII,\r\nforbidding the vicars to hold the feast or the _bourgeois_ to enforce\r\nit. All went well for some years, but in 1497 the _bourgeois_ grumbled\r\ngreatly, and in 1498, with the connivance of the municipal authorities\r\nthemselves, they broke out. On the eve of the Holy Innocents, between\r\nnine and ten o’clock, Jacques de l’Arcq, mayor of the _Edwardeurs_,\r\nand others got into the house of Messire Pasquier le Pâme, a chaplain,\r\nand dragged him half naked, through snow and frost, to a _cabaret_.\r\nSeven or eight other vicars, one of whom was found saying his Hours\r\nin a churchyard, were similarly treated, and as none of them would\r\nbe made _évesque des sotz_ they were all kept prisoners. The chapter\r\nprotested to the _prévost et jurez_, but in vain. On the following day\r\nthe _bourgeois_ chose one of the vicars _évesque_, baptized him by\r\ntorchlight with three buckets of water at a fountain, led him about\r\nfor three days in a surplice, and played scurrilous farces. They\r\nthen dismissed the vicar, and elected as _évesque_ a clerk from the\r\ndiocese of Cambrai, who defied the chapter. They drove Jean Parisiz,\r\nthe _curé_ of La Madeleine, who had displeased them, from his church\r\nin the midst of Vespers, and on Epiphany day made him too a prisoner.\r\nIn the following March the chapter and Messire Jean Parisiz brought a\r\njoint action before the High Court at Paris against the delinquents and\r\nthe municipal authorities, who had backed them up. The case came on for\r\nhearing in November, when it was pleaded that the custom of electing\r\nan _évesque des sotz_ upon Innocents’ day was an ancient one. The\r\nceremony took place upon a scaffold near the church door; there were\r\n_jeux_ in the streets for seven or eight days, and a final _convici_\r\nin which the canons and others of the town were satirized. The chapter\r\nand some of the citizens sent bread and wine. The same thing was done\r\nin many dioceses of Picardy, and even in Paris. It was all _ad solacium\r\npopuli_, and divine service was not disturbed, for nobody entered the\r\nchurch. The vicar who had been chosen _évesque_ thought it a great\r\nand unexpected honour. There would have been no trouble had not the\r\n_évesque_ when distributing hoods with ears at the end of the _jeux_\r\nunfortunately included certain persons who would rather have been\r\nleft out, and who consequently stirred up the chapter to take action.\r\nThe court adjourned the case, and ultimately it appears to have been\r\nsettled, for one of the documents preserved is endorsed with a note of\r\na _concordat_ between the chapter and the town, by which the feast was\r\nabolished in 1500[1084].\r\n\r\nOf the Feast of Fools in central France I can say but little. At\r\nChartres, the _Papi-Fol_ and his cardinals committed many insolences\r\nduring the first four days of the year, and exacted _droits_ from\r\npassers-by. They were suppressed in 1479 and again in 1504[1085].\r\nAt Tours a _Ritual_ of the fourteenth century contains elaborate\r\ndirections for the _festum novi anni, quod non debet remanere, nisi\r\ncorpora sint humi_. This is clearly a reformed feast, of which the\r\nchief features are the dramatic procession of the _Prophetae_,\r\nincluding doubtless Balaam on his ass, in church, and a _miraculum_ in\r\nthe cloister[1086]. The ‘Boy Bishop’ gives the benediction at Tierce,\r\nand before Vespers there are _chori_ (carols, I suppose) also in the\r\ncloisters. At Vespers _Deposuit_ is sung three times, and the _baculus_\r\nmay be taken. If so, the _thesaurarius_ is beaten with _baculi_ by\r\nthe clergy at Compline, and the new _cantor_ is led home with beating\r\nof _baculi_ on the walls[1087]. At Bourges, the use of the ‘Prose of\r\nthe Ass’ in Notre-Dame de Sales seems to imply the existence of the\r\nfeast, but I know no details[1088]. At Avallon the _dominus festi_\r\nseems to have been, as at Laon, a ‘patriarch,’ and to have officiated\r\non Innocents’ day. A chapter statute regulated the proceedings in 1453,\r\nand another abolished them in 1510[1089]. At Auxerre, full accounts of\r\na long chapter wrangle are preserved in the register[1090]. It began in\r\n1395 with an order requiring the decent performance of the _servitium_,\r\nand imposing a fee upon newly admitted canons towards the feast. In\r\n1396 the feast was not held, owing to the recent defeat of Sigismund\r\nof Hungary and the count of Nevers by Bajazet and his Ottomans at\r\nNicopolis[1091]. In 1398 the dean entered a protest against a grant of\r\nwine made by the chapter to the thirsty revellers. In 1400 a further\r\norder was passed to check various abuses, the excessive ringing of\r\nbells, the licence of the _sermones fatui_, the impounding of copes\r\nin pledge for contributions, the beating of men and women through\r\nthe streets, and all _derisiones_ likely to bring discredit on the\r\nchurch[1092]. In the following January, the bishop of Auxerre, Michel\r\nde Crency, intervened, forbidding the _fatui_ to form a ‘chapter,’\r\nor to appoint ‘proctors,’ or _clamare la fête aux fous_ after the\r\nsinging of the Hours in the church. This led to a storm. The bishop\r\nbrought an action in the secular court, and the chapter appealed to\r\nthe ecclesiastical court of the Sens province. In June, however, it\r\nwas agreed as part of a general _concordat_ between the parties, that\r\nall these proceedings should be _non avenu_[1093]. It seems, however,\r\nto have been understood that the chapter would reform the feast. On\r\nDecember 2, the abbot of Pontigny preached a sermon before the chapter\r\nin favour of the abolition of the feast, and on the following day the\r\ndean came down and warned the canons that it was the intention of the\r\nUniversity of Paris to take action, even if necessary, by calling in\r\nthe secular arm[1094]. It was better to reform themselves than to\r\nbe reformed. It was then agreed to suppress the abuses of the feast,\r\nthe sermons and the wearing of unecclesiastical garb, and to hold\r\nnothing but a _festum subdiaconorum_ on the day of the Circumcision.\r\nOutside the church, however, the clergy might dance and promenade\r\n(_chorizare ... et ... spatiare_) on the _place_ of St. Stephen’s.\r\nThese regulations were disregarded, on the plea that they were intended\r\nto apply only to the year in which they were made. In 1407 the chapter\r\ndeclared that they were to be permanent, but strong opposition was\r\noffered to this decision by three canons, Jean Piqueron, himself a\r\nsub-deacon, Jean Bonat, and Jean Berthome, who maintained that the\r\n_concordat_ with the bishop was for reform, not for abolition. The\r\nmatter was before the chapter for the last time, so far as the extant\r\ndocuments go, in 1411. On January 2, the dean reported that in spite\r\nof the prohibition certain _canonici tortrarii_[1095], chaplains and\r\nchoir-clerks had held the feast. A committee of investigation was\r\nappointed, and in December the prohibition was renewed. Jean Piqueron\r\nwas once more a protestant, and on this occasion obtained the support\r\nof five colleagues[1096]. It may be added that in the sixteenth century\r\nan _abbas stultorum_ was still annually elected on July 18, beneath a\r\ngreat elm at the porch of Auxerre cathedral. He was charged with the\r\nmaintenance of certain small points of choir discipline[1097].\r\n\r\nIn Franche Comté and Burgundy, the Feast of Fools is also found. At\r\nBesançon it was celebrated by all the four great churches. In the\r\ncathedrals of St. John and St. Stephen, ‘cardinals’ were chosen on St.\r\nStephen’s day by the deacons and sub-deacons, on St. John’s day by the\r\npriests, on the Holy Innocents’ day by the choir-clerks and choir-boys.\r\nIn the collegiate churches of St. Paul and St. Mary Magdalen, ‘bishops’\r\nor ‘abbots’ were similarly chosen. All these _domini festorum_ seem to\r\nhave had the generic title of _rois des fous_, and on the choir-feast\r\nfour cavalcades went about the streets and exchanged railleries (_se\r\nchantaient pouille_) when they met. In 1387 the _Statutes_ of cardinal\r\nThomas of Naples ordered that the feasts should be held jointly in each\r\nchurch in turn; and in 1518 the cavalcades were suppressed, owing to a\r\nconflict upon the bridge which had a fatal ending. Up to 1710, however,\r\n_reges_ were still elected in St. Mary Magdalen’s; not, indeed, those\r\nfor the three feasts of Christmas week, but a _rex capellanorum_ and\r\na _rex canonicorum_, who officiated respectively on the Circumcision\r\nand on Epiphany[1098]. At Autun the feast of the _baculus_ in the\r\nthirteenth century has already been recorded. In the fifteenth and\r\nsixteenth centuries some interesting notices are available in the\r\nchapter registers[1099]. In 1411 the feast required reforming. The\r\ncanons were ordered to attend in decent clothes as on the Nativity; and\r\nthe custom of leading an ass in procession and singing a _cantilena_\r\nthereon was suppressed[1100]. In 1412 the abolition of the feast was\r\ndecreed[1101]. But in 1484 it was sanctioned again, and licence was\r\ngiven to punish those who failed to put in an appearance at the Hours\r\nby burning at the well[1102]. This custom, however, was forbidden in\r\n1498[1103]. Nothing more is heard of the _asinus_, but it is possible\r\nthat he figured in the play of _Herod_ which was undoubtedly performed\r\nat the feast, and which gave a name to the _dominus festi_[1104]. Under\r\nthe general name of _festa fatuorum_ was included at Autun, besides\r\nthe feast of the Circumcision, also that of the ‘bishop’ and ‘dean’\r\nof Innocents, and a _missa fatuorum_ was sung _ex ore infantium_ from\r\nthe Innocents’ day to Epiphany[1105]. In 1499 Jean Rolin, abbot of\r\nSt. Martin’s and dean of Autun, led a renewed attack upon the feast.\r\nHe had armed himself with a letter from Louis XI, and induced the\r\nchapter, in virtue of the Basle decree, to suppress both Herod and the\r\n‘bishop’ of Innocents[1106]. In 1514 and 1515 the play of _Herod_ was\r\nperformed; but in 1518, when application was made to the chapter to\r\nsanction the election of both a ‘Herod’ and the ‘bishop’ and ‘dean’ of\r\nInnocents, they applied to the king’s official for leave, and failed\r\nto get it. Finally in 1535 the chapter recurred to the Basle decree,\r\nand again forbade the feast, particularly specifying under the name\r\nof _Gaigizons_ the obnoxious ceremony of ‘ducking.[1107]’ The feast\r\nheld in the ducal, afterwards royal chapel of Dijon yields documents\r\nwhich are unique, because they are in French verse. The first is a\r\n_mandement_ of Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, in 1454, confirming,\r\non the request of the _haut-Bâtonnier_, the privilege of the fête,\r\nagainst those who would abolish it. He declares\r\n\r\n    ‘Que cette Fête célébrée\r\n    Soit à jamais un jour l’année,\r\n    Le premier du mois de Janvier;\r\n    Et que joyeux Fous sans dangier,\r\n    De l’habit de notre Chapelle,\r\n    Fassent la Fête bonne et belle,\r\n    Sans outrage ni derision.’\r\n\r\nIn 1477 Louis XI seized Burgundy, and in 1482 his representatives, Jean\r\nd’Amboise, bishop and duke of Langres, lieutenant of the duchy, and\r\nBaudricourt the governor, accorded to Guy Baroset\r\n\r\n    ‘Protonotaire et Procureur des Foux,’\r\n\r\na fresh confirmation for the privilege of the feast held by\r\n\r\n    ‘Le Bâtonnier et tous ses vrais suppôts[1108].’\r\n\r\nThere was a second feast in Dijon at the church of St. Stephen. In 1494\r\nit was the custom here, as at Sens, to shave the ‘precentor’ of Fools\r\nupon a stage before the church. In 1621 the vicars still paraded the\r\nstreets with music and lanterns in honour of their ‘precentor[1109].’\r\nIn 1552, however, the Feasts of Fools throughout Burgundy had been\r\nprohibited by an _arrêt_ of the _Parlement_ of Dijon. This was\r\nimmediately provoked by the desire of the chapter of St. Vincent’s\r\nat Châlons-sur-Saône to end the scandal of the feast under their\r\njurisdiction. It was, however, general in its terms, and probably put\r\nan end to the _Chapelle_ feast at Dijon, since to about this period may\r\nbe traced the origin of the famous _compagnie_ of the _Mère-Folle_ in\r\nthat city[1110].\r\n\r\nIn Dauphiné there was a _rex et festum fatuorum_ at St. Apollinaire’s\r\nin Valence, but I cannot give the date[1111]. At Vienne the _Statutes_\r\nof St. Maurice, passed in 1385, forbid the _abbas stultorum seu\r\nsociorum_, but apparently allow _rois_ on the Circumcision and\r\nEpiphany, as well as in the three post-Nativity feasts. They also\r\nforbid certain _ludibria_. No _pasquinades_ are to be recited, and\r\nno one is to be carried _in Rost_ or to have his property put in\r\npawn[1112]. More can be said of the feast at Viviers. A _Ceremonial_\r\nof 1365 contains minute directions for its conduct[1113]. On December\r\n17 the _sclafardi et clericuli_ chose an _abbas stultus_ to be\r\nresponsible, as at Auxerre, for the decorum of the choir throughout\r\nthe year. He was shouldered and borne to a place of honour at a\r\ndrinking-bout. Here even the bishop, if present, must do him honour.\r\nAfter the drinking, the company divided into two parts, one composed of\r\ninferior clergy, the other of dignitaries, and sang a doggerel song,\r\neach endeavouring to sing its rival down. They shouted, hissed, howled,\r\ncackled, jeered and gesticulated; and the victors mocked and flouted\r\nthe vanquished. Then the door-keeper made a proclamation on behalf of\r\nthe ‘abbot,’ calling on all to follow him, on pain of having their\r\nbreeches slit, and the whole crew rushed violently out of the church.\r\nA progress through the town followed, which was repeated daily until\r\nChristmas eve[1114]. On the three post-Nativity feasts, a distinct\r\n_dominus festi_, the _episcopus stultus_, apparently elected the\r\nprevious year, took the place of the _abbas_. On each of these days he\r\npresided at Matins, Mass, and Vespers, sat in full pontificals on the\r\nbishop’s throne, attended by his ‘chaplain,’ and gave the Benedictions.\r\nBoth on St. Stephen’s and St. John’s days these were followed by the\r\nrecitation of a burlesque formula of indulgence[1115]. The whole\r\nfestivity seems to have concluded on Innocents’ day with the election\r\nof a new _episcopus_, who, after the shouldering and the drinking-bout,\r\ntook his stand at a window of the great hall of the bishop’s palace,\r\nand blessed the people of the city[1116]. The _episcopus_ was bound to\r\ngive a supper to his fellows. In 1406 one William Raynoard attempted to\r\nevade this obligation. An action was brought against him in the court\r\nof the bishop’s official, by the then _abbas_ and his predecessor.\r\nIt was referred to the arbitration of three canons, who decided that\r\nRaynoard must give the supper on St. Bartholomew’s next, August 24, at\r\nthe accustomed place (a tavern, one fears) in the little village of\r\nGras, near Viviers[1117].\r\n\r\nFinally, there are examples of the Feast of Fools in Provence. At\r\nArles it was held in the church of St. Trophime, and is said to have\r\nbeen presented, out of its due season, it may be supposed, for the\r\namusement of the Emperor Charles IV at his coronation in 1365, to have\r\nscandalized him and so to have met its end[1118]. Nevertheless in the\r\nfifteenth century an ‘archbishop of Innocents,’ _alias stultus_, still\r\nsang the ‘_O_’ on St. Thomas’s day, officiated on the days of St. John\r\nand the Innocents, and on St. Trophime’s day (Dec. 29) paid a visit to\r\nthe _abadesse fole_ of the convent of Saint-Césaire. The real abbess\r\nof this convent was bound to provide chicken, bread and wine for his\r\nregaling[1119]. At Fréjus in 1558 an attempt to put down the feast led\r\nto a riot. The bishop, Léon des Ursins, was threatened with murder,\r\nand had to hide while his palace was stormed[1120]. At Aix the chapter\r\nof St. Saviour’s chose on St. Thomas’s day, an _episcopus fatuus vel\r\nInnocentium_ from the choir-boys. He officiated on Innocents’ day, and\r\nboys and canons exchanged stalls. The custom lasted until at least\r\n1585[1121]. Antibes, as late as 1645, affords a rare example of the\r\nfeast held by a religious house. It was on Innocents’ day in the church\r\nof the Franciscans. The choir and office were left to the lay-brothers,\r\nthe _quêteurs_, cooks and gardeners. These put on the vestments inside\r\nout, held the books upside down, and wore spectacles with rounds of\r\norange peel instead of glasses. They blew the ashes from the censers\r\nupon each other’s faces and heads, and instead of the proper liturgy\r\nchanted confused and inarticulate gibberish. All this is recorded by\r\nthe contemporary free-thinker Mathurin de Neuré in a letter to his\r\nleader and inspirer, Gassendi[1122].\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the range of the Feast of Fools in France, so\r\nfar as I have come across it, seems markedly to exclude the west and\r\nsouth-west of the country. I have not been able to verify an alleged\r\nexception at Bordeaux[1123]. Possibly there is some ethnographical\r\nreason for this. But on the whole, I am inclined to think that it is\r\nan accident, and that a more complete investigation would disclose a\r\nsufficiency of examples in this area. Outside France, the Feast of\r\nFools is of much less importance. The Spanish disciplinary councils\r\nappear to make no specific mention of it, although they know the\r\ncognate feast of the Boy Bishop, and more than once prohibit _ludi_,\r\n_choreae_, and so forth, in general terms[1124]. In Germany, again, I\r\ndo not know of a case in which the term ‘Fools’ is used. But the feast\r\nitself occurs sporadically. As early as the twelfth century, Herrad\r\nvon Landsberg, abbess of Hohenburg, complained that miracle-plays,\r\nsuch as that of the _Magi_, instituted on Epiphany and its octave by\r\nthe Fathers of the Church, had given place to licence, buffoonery and\r\nquarrelling. The priests came into the churches dressed as knights, to\r\ndrink and play in the company of courtesans[1125]. A Mosburg _Gradual_\r\nof 1360 contains a series of _cantiones_ compiled and partly written by\r\nthe dean John von Perchausen for use when the _scholarium episcopus_\r\nwas chosen at the Nativity[1126]. Some of these, however, are shown by\r\ntheir headings or by internal evidence to belong rather to a New Year’s\r\nday feast, than to one on Innocents’ day[1127]. A _festum baculi_ is\r\nmentioned and an _episcopus_ or _praesul_ who is chosen and enthroned.\r\nOne carol has the following refrain[1128]:\r\n\r\n    ‘gaudeamus et psallamus novo praesuli\r\n    ad honorem et decorem sumpti baculi.’\r\n\r\nAnother is so interesting, for its classical turn, and for the names\r\nwhich it gives to the ‘bishop’ and his crew that I quote it in\r\nfull[1129].\r\n\r\n    1.  Gregis pastor Tityrus,\r\n        asinorum dominus,\r\n        noster est episcopus.\r\n\r\n    R^o. eia, eia, eia,\r\n        vocant nos ad gaudia\r\n        Tityri cibaria.\r\n\r\n    2.  ad honorem Tityri,\r\n        festum colant baculi\r\n        satrapae et asini.\r\n\r\n    R^o. eia, eia, eia,\r\n        vocant nos ad gaudia;\r\n        Tityri cibaria.\r\n\r\n    3.  applaudamus Tityro\r\n        cum melodis organo,\r\n        cum chordis et tympano.\r\n\r\n    4.  veneremur Tityrum,\r\n        qui nos propter baculum\r\n        invitat ad epulum.\r\n\r\nThe reforms of the council of Basle were adopted for Germany by the\r\nEmperor Albrecht II in the _Instrumentum Acceptationis_ of Mainz in\r\n1439. In 1536 the council of Cologne, quoting the decretal of Innocent\r\nIII, condemned _theatrales ludi_ in churches. A Cologne _Ritual_\r\npreserves an account of the sub-deacons’ feast upon the octave of\r\nEpiphany[1130]. The sub-deacons were _hederaceo serto coronati_. Tapers\r\nwere lit, and a _rex_ chosen, who acted as _hebdomarius_ from first to\r\nsecond Vespers. Carols were sung, as at Mosburg[1131].\r\n\r\nJohn Huss, early in the fifteenth century, describes the Feast of Fools\r\nas it existed in far-off Bohemia[1132]. The revellers, of whom, to\r\nhis remorse, Huss had himself been one as a lad, wore masks. A clerk,\r\ngrotesquely vested, was dubbed ‘bishop,’ set on an ass with his face to\r\nthe tail, and led to mass in the church. He was regaled on a platter\r\nof broth and a bowl of beer, and Huss recalls the unseemly revel which\r\ntook place[1133]. Torches were borne instead of candles, and the clergy\r\nturned their garments inside out, and danced. These _ludi_ had been\r\nforbidden by one archbishop John of holy memory.\r\n\r\nIt would be surprising, in view of the close political and\r\necclesiastical relations between mediaeval France and England, if the\r\nFeast of Fools had not found its way across the channel. It did; but\r\napparently it never became so inveterate as successfully to resist\r\nthe disciplinary zeal of reforming bishops, and the few notices of it\r\nare all previous to the end of the fourteenth century. It seems to\r\nhave lasted longest at Lincoln, and at Beverley. Of Lincoln, it will\r\nbe remembered, Pierre de Corbeil, the probable compiler of the Sens\r\n_Officium_, was at one time coadjutor bishop. Robert Grosseteste, whose\r\nattack upon the _Inductio Maii_ and other village festivals served as a\r\nstarting-point for this discussion, was no less intolerant of the Feast\r\nof Fools. In 1236 he forbade it to be held either in the cathedral or\r\nelsewhere in the diocese[1134]; and two years later he included the\r\nprohibition in his formal _Constitutions_[1135]. But after another\r\ncentury and a half, when William Courtney, archbishop of Canterbury,\r\nmade a visitation of Lincoln in 1390, he found that the vicars were\r\nstill in the habit of disturbing divine service on January 1, in the\r\nname of the feast[1136]. Probably his strict mandate put a stop to the\r\ncustom[1137]. At almost precisely the same date the Feast of Fools was\r\nforbidden by the statutes of Beverley minster, although the sub-deacons\r\nand other inferior clergy were still to receive a special commons\r\non the day of the Circumcision[1138]. Outside Lincoln and Beverley,\r\nthe feast is only known in England by the mention of paraphernalia\r\nfor it in thirteenth-century inventories of St. Paul’s[1139], and\r\nSalisbury[1140], and by a doubtful allusion in a sophisticated version\r\nof the St. George play[1141].\r\n\r\nA brief summary of the data concerning the Feast of Fools presented\r\nin this and the preceding chapter is inevitable. It may be combined\r\nwith some indication of the relation in which the feast stands with\r\nregard to the other feasts dealt with in the present volume. If we\r\nlook back to Belethus in the twelfth century we find him speaking\r\nof the Feast of Fools as held on the Circumcision, on Epiphany\r\nor on the octave of Epiphany, and as being specifically a feast\r\nof sub-deacons. Later records bear out on the whole the first of\r\nthese statements. As a rule the feast focussed on the Circumcision,\r\nalthough the rejoicings were often prolonged, and the election of the\r\n_dominus festi_ in some instances gave rise to a minor celebration\r\non an earlier day. Occasionally (Noyon, Laon) the Epiphany, once at\r\nleast (Cologne) the octave of the Epiphany, takes the place of the\r\nCircumcision. But we also find the term Feast of Fools extended to\r\ncover one or more of three feasts, distinguished from it by Belethus,\r\nwhich immediately follow Christmas. Sometimes it includes them all\r\nthree (Besançon, Viviers, Vienne), sometimes the feast of the Innocents\r\nalone (Autun, Avallon, Aix, Antibes, Arles), once the feast of St.\r\nStephen (Châlons-sur-Marne)[1142]. On the other hand, the definition\r\nof the feast as a sub-deacons’ feast is not fully applicable to its\r\nlater developments. Traces of a connexion with the sub-deacons appear\r\nmore than once (Amiens, Sens, Auxerre, Beverley); but as a rule the\r\nfeast is held by the inferior clergy known as vicars, chaplains, and\r\nchoir-clerks, all of whom are grouped at Viviers and Romans under the\r\ngeneral term of _esclaffardi_. At Laon a part is taken in it by the\r\n_curés_ of the various parishes in the city. The explanation is, I\r\nthink, fairly obvious. Originally, perhaps, the sub-deacons held the\r\nfeast, just as the deacons, priests, and boys held theirs in Christmas\r\nweek. But it had its vogue mainly in the great cathedrals served by\r\nsecular canons[1143], and in these the distinction between the canons\r\nin different orders--for a sub-deacon might be a full canon[1144]--was\r\nof less importance than the difference between the canons as a whole\r\nand the minor clergy who made up the rest of the cathedral body,\r\nthe hired choir-clerks, the vicars choral who, originally at least,\r\nsupplied the place in the choir of absent canons, and the chaplains\r\nwho served the chantries or small foundations attached to the\r\ncathedral[1145]. The status of spiritual dignity gave way to the status\r\nof material preferment. And so, as the vicars gradually coalesced\r\ninto a corporation of their own, the Feast of Fools passed into their\r\nhands, and became a celebration of the annual election of the head of\r\ntheir body[1146]. The vicars and their associates were probably an\r\nill-educated and an ill-paid class. Certainly they were difficult to\r\ndiscipline[1147]; and it is not surprising that their rare holiday,\r\nof which the expenses were met partly by the chapter, partly by dues\r\nlevied upon themselves or upon the bystanders[1148], was an occasion\r\nfor popular rather than refined merry-making[1149]. That it should\r\nperpetuate or absorb folk-customs was also, considering the peasant or\r\nsmall _bourgeois_ extraction of such men, quite natural.\r\n\r\nThe simple psychology of the last two sentences really gives the\r\nkey to the nature of the feast. It was largely an ebullition of the\r\nnatural lout beneath the cassock. The vicars hooted and sang improper\r\nditties, and played dice upon the altar, in a reaction from the wonted\r\nrestraints of choir discipline. Familiarity breeds contempt, and\r\nit was almost an obvious sport to burlesque the sacred and tedious\r\nceremonies with which they were only too painfully familiar. Indeed,\r\nthe reverend founders and reformers of the feast had given a lead to\r\nthis apishness by the introduction of the symbolical transference of\r\nthe _baculus_ at the _Deposuit_ in the _Magnificat_. The ruling idea of\r\nthe feast is the inversion of status, and the performance, inevitably\r\nburlesque, by the inferior clergy of functions properly belonging to\r\ntheir betters. The fools jangle the bells (Paris, Amiens, Auxerre),\r\nthey take the higher stalls (Paris), sing dissonantly (Sens), repeat\r\nmeaningless words (Châlons, Antibes), say the _messe liesse_ (Laon) or\r\nthe _missa fatuorum_ (Autun), preach the _sermones fatui_ (Auxerre),\r\ncense _praepostere_ (St. Omer) with pudding and sausage (Beauvais) or\r\nwith old shoes (Paris theologians). They have their chapter and their\r\nproctors (Auxerre, Dijon). They install their _dominus festi_ with a\r\nceremony of _sacre_ (Troyes), or shaving (Sens, Dijon). He is vested\r\nin full pontificals, goes in procession, as at the _Rabardiaux_ of\r\nLaon, gives the benedictions, issues indulgences (Viviers), has his\r\nseal (Lille), perhaps his right of coining (Laon). Much in all these\r\nproceedings was doubtless the merest horseplay; such ingenuity and\r\nhumour as they required may have been provided by the wicked wit of the\r\n_goliardi_[1150].\r\n\r\nNow I would point out that this inversion of status so characteristic\r\nof the Feast of Fools is equally characteristic of folk-festivals.\r\nWhat is Dr. Frazer’s mock king but one of the meanest of the people\r\nchosen out to represent the real king as the priest victim of a divine\r\nsacrifice, and surrounded, for the period of the feast, in a naïve\r\nattempt to outwit heaven, with all the paraphernalia and luxury of\r\nkingship? Precisely such a mock king is the _dominus festi_ with whom\r\nwe have to do. His actual titles, indeed, are generally ecclesiastical.\r\nMost often he is a ‘bishop,’ or ‘prelate’ (Senlis); in metropolitan\r\nchurches an ‘archbishop,’ in churches exempt from other authority\r\nthan that of the Holy See, a ‘pope’ (Amiens, Senlis, Chartres). More\r\nrarely he is a ‘patriarch’ (Laon, Avallon), a ‘cardinal’ (Paris,\r\nBesançon), an ‘abbot’ (Vienne, Viviers, Romans, Auxerre)[1151], or is\r\neven content with the humbler dignity of ‘precentor,’ ‘_bacularius_’\r\nor ‘_bâtonnier_’ (Sens, Dijon). At Autun he is, quite exceptionally,\r\n‘Herod.’ Nevertheless the term ‘king’ is not unknown. It is found at\r\nNoyon, at Vienne, at Besançon, at Beverley, and the council of Basle\r\ntestifies to its use, as well as that of ‘duke.’ Nor is it, after all,\r\nof much importance what the _dominus festi_ is called. The point is\r\nthat his existence and functions in the ecclesiastical festivals afford\r\nprecise parallels to his existence and functions in folk-festivals all\r\nEurope over.\r\n\r\nBesides the ‘king’ many other features of the folk-festivals may\r\nreadily be traced at the Feast of Fools. Some here, some there, they\r\njot up in the records. There are dance and _chanson_, _tripudium_ and\r\n_cantilena_ (Noyon, Châlons-sur-Marne, Paris theologians, council of\r\nBasle). There is eating and drinking, not merely in the refectory,\r\nbut within or at the doors of the church itself (Paris theologians,\r\nBeauvais, Prague). There is ball-playing (Châlons-sur-Marne).\r\nThere is the procession or cavalcade through the streets (Laon,\r\nChâlons-sur-Marne, &c.). There are torches and lanterns (Sens,\r\nTournai). Men are led _nudi_ (Sens); they are whipped (Tours); they\r\nare ceremonially ducked or roasted (Sens, Tournai, Vienne, _les\r\nGaigizons_ at Autun)[1152]. A comparison with earlier chapters of the\r\npresent volume will establish the significance which these points,\r\ntaken in bulk, possess. Equally characteristic of folk-festivals\r\nis the costume considered proper to the feasts. The riotous clergy\r\nwear their vestments inside out (Antibes), or exchange dress with\r\nthe laity (Lincoln, Paris theologians). But they also wear leaves or\r\nflowers (Sens, Laon, Cologne) and women’s dress (Paris theologians);\r\nand above all they wear hideous and monstrous masks, _larvae_ or\r\n_personae_ (decretal of 1207, Paris theologians, council of Basle,\r\nParis, Soissons, Laon, Lille). These masks, indeed, are perhaps the\r\none feature of the feast which called down the most unqualified\r\ncondemnation from the ecclesiastical authorities. We shall not be far\r\nwrong if we assume them to have been beast-masks, and to have taken the\r\nplace of the actual skins and heads of sacrificial animals, here, as so\r\noften, worn at the feast by the worshippers.\r\n\r\nAn attempt has been made to find an oriental origin for the Feast\r\nof Fools[1153]. Gibbon relates the insults offered to the church\r\nat Constantinople by the Emperor Michael III, the ‘Drunkard’\r\n(842-67)[1154]. A noisy crew of courtiers dressed themselves in the\r\nsacred vestments. One Theophilus or Grylus, captain of the guard, a\r\nmime and buffoon, was chosen as a mock ‘patriarch.’ The rest were his\r\ntwelve ‘metropolitans,’ Michael himself being entitled ‘metropolitan\r\nof Cologne.’ The ‘divine mysteries’ were burlesqued with vinegar and\r\nmustard in a golden cup set with gems. Theophilus rode about the\r\nstreets of the city on a white ass, and when he met the real patriarch\r\nIgnatius, exposed him to the mockery of the revellers. After the\r\ndeath of Michael, this profanity was solemnly anathematized by the\r\ncouncil of Constantinople held under his successor Basil in 869[1155].\r\nTheophilus, though he borrowed the vestments for his mummery, seems to\r\nhave carried it on in the streets and the palace, not in the church.\r\nIn the tenth century, however, the patriarch Theophylactus won an\r\nunenviable reputation by admitting dances and profane songs into the\r\necclesiastical festivals[1156]; while in the twelfth, the patriarch\r\nBalsamon describes his own unavailing struggle against proceedings at\r\nChristmas and Candlemas, which come uncommonly near the Feast of Fools.\r\nThe clergy of St. Sophia’s, he says, claim as of ancient custom to wear\r\nmasks, and to enter the church in the guise of soldiers, or of monks,\r\nor of four-footed animals. The superintendents snap their fingers like\r\ncharioteers, or paint their faces and mimic women. The rustics are\r\nmoved to laughter by the pouring of wine into pitchers, and are allowed\r\nto chant _Kyrie eleison_ in ludicrous iteration at every verse[1157].\r\nBalsamon, who died in 1193, was almost precisely a contemporary of\r\nBelethus, and the earlier Byzantine notices considerably ante-date any\r\nrecords that we possess of the Feast of Fools in the West. A slight\r\ncorroboration of this theory of an eastern origin may be derived from\r\nthe use of the term ‘patriarch’ for the _dominus festi_ at Laon and\r\nAvallon. It would, I think, be far-fetched to find another in the fact\r\nthat Theophilus, like the western ‘bishops’ of Fools, rode upon an ass,\r\nand that the _Prose de l’Âne_ begins:\r\n\r\n    ‘Orientis partibus,\r\n    adventavit asinus.’\r\n\r\nIn any case, the oriental example can hardly be responsible for more\r\nthan the admission of the feast within the doors of the church. One\r\ncannot doubt that it was essentially an adaptation of a folk-custom\r\nlong perfectly well known in the West itself. The question of origin\r\nhad already presented itself to the learned writers of the thirteenth\r\ncentury. William of Auxerre, by a misunderstanding which I shall hope\r\nto explain, traced the Feast of Fools to the Roman _Parentalia_:\r\nDurandus, and the Paris theologians after him, to the January\r\nKalends. Certainly Durandus was right. The Kalends, unlike the more\r\nspecifically Italian feasts, were co-extensive with the Roman empire,\r\nand were naturally widespread in Gaul. The date corresponds precisely\r\nwith that by far the most common for the Feast of Fools. A singular\r\nhistory indeed, that of the ecclesiastical celebration of the First\r\nof January. Up to the eighth century a fast, with its mass _pro\r\nprohibendo ab idolis_, it gradually took on a festal character, and\r\nbecame ultimately the one feast in the year in which paganism made its\r\nmost startling and persistent recoil upon Christianity. The attacks\r\nupon the Kalends in the disciplinary documents form a catena which\r\nextends very nearly to the point at which the notices of the Feast\r\nof Fools begin. In each alike the masking, in mimicry of beasts and\r\nprobably of beast-gods or ‘demons,’ appears to have been a prominent\r\nand highly reprobated feature. It is true that we hear nothing of a\r\n_dominus festi_ at the Kalends; but much stress must not be laid upon\r\nthe omission of the disciplinary writers to record any one point in a\r\ncustom which after all they were not describing as anthropologists,\r\nand it would certainly be an exceptional Germano-Keltic folk-feast\r\nwhich had not a _dominus_. As a matter of fact, there is no mention of\r\na _rex_ in the accounts of the pre-Christian Kalends in Italy itself.\r\nThere was a _rex_ at the _Saturnalia_, and this, together with an\r\nallusion of Belethus in a quite different connexion to the _libertas\r\nDecembrica_[1158], has led some writers to find in the _Saturnalia_,\r\nrather than the Kalends, the origin of the Feast of Fools[1159]. This\r\nis, I venture to think, wrong. The _Saturnalia_ were over well before\r\nDecember 25: there is no evidence that they had a vogue outside Italy:\r\nthe Kalends, like the _Saturnalia_, were an occasion at which slaves\r\nmet their masters upon equal terms, and I believe that the existence of\r\na Kalends _rex_, both in Italy and in Gaul, may be taken for granted.\r\n\r\nBut the parallel between Kalends and the Feast of Fools cannot be held\r\nto be quite perfect, unless we can trace in the latter feast that most\r\ncharacteristic of all Kalends customs, the _Cervulus_. Is it possible\r\nthat a representative of the _Cervulus_ is to be found in the Ass,\r\nwho, whether introduced from Constantinople or not, gave to the Feast\r\nof Fools one of its popular names? The Feast of Asses has been the\r\nsport of controversialists who had not, and were at no great pains to\r\nhave, the full facts before them. I do not propose to awake once more\r\nthese ancient angers[1160]. The facts themselves are briefly these.\r\nThe ‘Prose of the Ass’ was used at Bourges, at Sens, and at Beauvais.\r\nAs to the Bourges feast I have no details. At Sens, the use of the\r\nProse by Pierre de Corbeil is indeed no proof that he allowed an ass to\r\nappear in the ceremony. But the Prose would not have much point unless\r\nit was at least a survival from a time when an ass did appear; the\r\nfeast was known as the _asinaria festa_; and even now, three centuries\r\nafter it was abolished, the Sens choir-boys still play at being _âne_\r\narchbishop on Innocents’ day[1161]. At Beauvais the heading _Conductus\r\nquando asinus adducitur_ in the thirteenth-century _Officium_ seems\r\nto show that there at least the ass appeared, and even entered the\r\nchurch. The document, also of the thirteenth century, quoted by the\r\neditors of Ducange, certainly brings him, in the ceremony of January\r\n14, into the church and near the altar. An imitation of his braying is\r\nintroduced into the service itself. At Autun the leading of an ass _ad\r\nprocessionem_, and the _cantilena super dictum asinum_ were suppressed\r\nin 1411. At Châlons-sur-Marne in 1570 an ass bore the ‘bishop’ to the\r\ntheatre at the church door only. At Prague, on the other hand, towards\r\nthe end of the fourteenth century, an ass was led, as at Beauvais,\r\nright into the church. These, with doubtful references to _fêtes des\r\nânes_ at St. Quentin about 1081, at Béthune in 1474, and at Laon\r\nin 1527, and the Mosburg description of the ‘bishop’ as _asinorum\r\ndominus_, are all the cases I have found in which an ass has anything\r\nto do with the feast. But they are enough to prove that an ass was an\r\nearly and widespread, though not an invariable feature. I may quote\r\nhere a curious survival in a _ronde_ from the west of France, said to\r\nhave been sung at church doors on January 1[1162]. It is called _La\r\nMort de l’Âne_, and begins:\r\n\r\n      ‘Quand le bonhomme s’en va,\r\n      Quand le bonhomme s’en va,\r\n      Trouvit la tête à son âne,\r\n      Que le loup mangit au bois.\r\n\r\n    _Parlé._ O tête, pauvre tête,\r\n             Tâ qui chantas si bé\r\n             _L’Magnificat_ à Vêpres.\r\n\r\n      Daux matin à quat’ leçons,\r\n      La sambredondon, bredondaine,\r\n      Daux matin à quat’ léçons,\r\n          La sambredondon.’\r\n\r\nThis, like the Sens choir-boys’ custom of calling their ‘archbishop’\r\n_âne_, would seem to suggest that the _dominus festi_ was himself the\r\nass, with a mask on; and this may have been sometimes the case. But in\r\nmost of the mediaeval instances the ass was probably used to ride. At\r\nPrague, so far as one can judge from Huss’s description, he was a real\r\nass. There is no proof in any of the French examples that he was, or\r\nwas not, merely a ‘hobby-ass.’ If he was, he came all the nearer to the\r\n_Cervulus_.\r\n\r\nIt has been pointed out, and will, in the next volume, be pointed\r\nout again, that the ecclesiastical authorities attempted to sanctify\r\nthe spirit of play at the Feast of Fools and similar festivities by\r\ndiverting the energies of the revellers to _ludi_ of the miracle-play\r\norder. In such _ludi_ they found a place for the ass. He appears for\r\ninstance as Balaam’s ass in the later versions from Laon and Rouen of\r\nthe _Prophetae_, and at Rouen he gave to the whole of this performance\r\nthe name of the _festum_ or _processio asinorum_[1163]. At Hamburg, by\r\na curious combination, he is at once Balaam’s ass and the finder of the\r\nstar in a _ludus Trium Regum_[1164]. His use as the mount of the Virgin\r\non January 14 at Beauvais, and on some uncertain day at Sens, seems to\r\nsuggest another favourite episode in such _ludi_, that of the Flight\r\ninto Egypt. At Varennes, in Picardy, and at Bayonne, exist carved\r\nwooden groups representing this event. That of Varennes is carried in\r\nprocession; that of Bayonne is the object of pilgrimage on the _fêtes_\r\nof the Virgin[1165].\r\n\r\nNot at the Feast of Fools alone, or at the miracle-plays connected with\r\nthis feast, did the ass make its appearance in Christian worship. It\r\nstood with the ox, on the morning of the Nativity, beside the Christmas\r\ncrib. On Palm Sunday it again formed part of a procession, in the\r\nsemblance of the beast on which Christ made his triumphal entry into\r\nJerusalem[1166]. A Cambrai _Ordinarium_ quoted by Ducange directs that\r\nthe _asina picta_ shall remain behind the altar for four days[1167].\r\nKirchmeyer describes the custom as it existed during the sixteenth\r\ncentury in Germany[1168]; and the stray tourist who drops into the\r\nwonderful collection of domestic and ecclesiastical antiquities in\r\nthe Barfüsserkirche at Basle will find there three specimens of the\r\n_Palmesel_, including a thirteenth-century one from Bayern and a\r\nseventeenth-century one from Elsass. The third is not labelled with its\r\n_provenance_, but it is on wheels and has a hole for the rope by which\r\nit was dragged round the church. All three are of painted wood, and\r\nupon each is a figure representing Christ[1169].\r\n\r\nThe affiliation of the ecclesiastical New Year revelries to the pagan\r\nKalends does not explain why those who took part in them were called\r\n‘Fools.’ The obvious thing to say is that they were called ‘Fools’\r\nbecause they played the fool; and indeed their mediaeval critics were\r\nnot slow to draw this inference. But it is noteworthy that pagan\r\nRome already had its Feast of Fools, which, indeed, had nothing to do\r\nwith the Kalends. The _stultorum feriae_ on February 17 was the last\r\nday on which the _Fornacalia_ or ritual sacrifice of the _curiae_ was\r\nheld. Upon it all the _curiae_ sacrificed in common, and it therefore\r\nafforded an opportunity for any citizen who did not know which his\r\n_curia_ was to partake in the ceremony[1170]. I am not prepared to\r\nsay that the _stultorum feriae_ gave its name to the Feast of Fools;\r\nbut the identity of the two names certainly seems to explain some of\r\nthe statements which mediaeval scholars make about that feast. It\r\nexplains William of Auxerre’s derivation of it from the _Parentalia_,\r\nfor the _stultorum feriae_ fell in the midst of the _Parentalia_[1171].\r\nAnd I think it explains the remark of Belethus, and, following him,\r\nof Durandus, about the _ordo subdiaconorum_ being _incertus_. The\r\nsub-deacons were a regular _ordo_, the highest of the _ordines minores_\r\nfrom the third century[1172]. But Belethus seems to be struggling\r\nwith the notion that the sub-deacons’ feast, closing the series of\r\npost-Nativity feasts held by deacons, priests and choir-boys, was\r\nin some way parallel to the _feriae_ of the Roman _stulti_ who were\r\n_incerti_ as to their _curia_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n                            THE BOY BISHOP\r\n\r\n    [_Bibliographical Note._--Most of the authorities for chh.\r\n    xiii, xiv, are still available, since many writers have not\r\n    been careful to distinguish between the various feasts of the\r\n    Twelve nights. The best modern account of the Boy Bishop is\r\n    Mr. A. F. Leach’s paper on _The Schoolboys’ Feast_ in _The\r\n    Fortnightly Review_, N. S. lix (1896), 128. The contributions\r\n    of F. A. Dürr, _Commentatio Historica de Episcopo Puerorum,\r\n    vulgo vom Schul-Bischoff_ (1755); F. A. Specht, _Geschichte\r\n    des Unterrichtswesens in Deutschland_, 222 sqq. (1885); A.\r\n    Gasté, _Les Drames liturgiques de la Cathédrale de Rouen_, 35\r\n    sqq. (1893); E. F. Rimbault, _The Festival of the Boy Bishop\r\n    in England_ in _The Camden Miscellany_, vol. vii (Camden Soc.\r\n    1875), are also valuable. Dr. Rimbault speaks of ‘considerable\r\n    collections for a history of the festival of the Boy Bishop\r\n    throughout Europe,’ made by Mr. J. G. Nichols, but I do not know\r\n    where these are to be found. Brand (ed. Ellis), i. 227 sqq.,\r\n    has some miscellaneous data, and a notice interesting by reason\r\n    of its antiquity is that on the _Episcopus Puerorum, in Die\r\n    Innocentium_, in the _Posthuma_, 95 sqq., of John Gregory (1649).]\r\n\r\n\r\nJoannes Belethus, the learned theologian of Paris and Amiens, towards\r\nthe end of the twelfth century, describes, as well as the Feast of\r\nFools, no less than three other _tripudia_ falling in Christmas\r\nweek[1173]. Upon the days of St. Stephen, St. John the Evangelist, and\r\nthe Holy Innocents, the deacons, the priests, the choir-boys, held\r\ntheir respective revels, each body in turn claiming that pre-eminence\r\nin the divine services which in the Feast of Fools was assigned to the\r\nsub-deacons. The distinction drawn by Belethus is not wholly observed\r\nin the ecclesiastical prohibitions either of the thirteenth or of the\r\nfifteenth century. In many of these the term ‘Feast of Fools’ has a\r\nwide meaning. The council of Nevers in 1246 includes under it the\r\nfeasts of the Innocents and the New Year; that of Langres in 1404\r\nthe ‘festivals of the Nativity’; that of Nantes in 1431 the Nativity\r\nitself, St. Stephen’s, St. John’s, and the Innocents’. For the council\r\nof Basle it is apparently synonymous with the ‘Feast of Innocents or\r\nBoys’; the Paris theologians speak of its rites as practised on St.\r\nStephen’s, the Innocents’, the Circumcision, and other dates. The same\r\ntendency to group all these _tripudia_ together recurs in passages\r\nin which the ‘Feast of Fools’ is not in so many words mentioned. The\r\nfamous decretal of Pope Innocent III is directed against the _ludibria_\r\npractised in turns by deacons, priests, and sub-deacons during the\r\nfeasts immediately following upon Christmas. The _irrisio servitii_\r\ninveighed against in the _Rememoratio_ of Gerson took place on\r\nInnocents’ day, on the Circumcision, on the Epiphany, or at Shrovetide.\r\n\r\nLocal usage, however, only partly bears out this loose language of the\r\nprohibitions. At Châlons-sur-Marne, in 1570, the ‘bishop’ of Fools\r\nsported on St. Stephen’s day. At Besançon, in 1387, a distinct _dominus\r\nfesti_ was chosen on each of the three days after Christmas, and all\r\nalike were called _rois des fous_. At Autun, during the fifteenth\r\ncentury, the _regna_ of the ‘bishop’ and ‘dean’ of Innocents and of\r\n‘Herod’ at the New Year were known together as the _festa folorum_.\r\nFurther south, the identification is perhaps more common. At Avallon,\r\nAix, Antibes, the Feast of Fools was on Innocents’ day; at Arles the\r\n_episcopus stultorum_ officiated both on the Innocents’ and on St.\r\nJohn’s, at Viviers on all three of the post-Nativity feasts. But these\r\nare exceptions, and, at least outside Provence, the rule seems to\r\nhave been to apply the name of ‘Feast of Fools’ to the _tripudium_,\r\noriginally that of the sub-deacons, on New Year’s day or the Epiphany,\r\nand to distinguish from this, as does Belethus, the _tripudia_ of the\r\ndeacons, priests, and choir-boys in Christmas week.\r\n\r\nWe may go further and say, without much hesitation, that the three\r\nlatter feasts are of older ecclesiastical standing than their riotous\r\nrival. Belethus is the first writer to mention the Feast of Fools,\r\nbut he is by no means the first writer to mention the Christmas\r\n_tripudia_. They were known to Honorius of Autun[1174], early in the\r\ntwelfth century, and to John of Avranches[1175], late in the eleventh.\r\nThey can be traced at least from the beginning of the tenth, more\r\nthan two hundred and fifty years before the Feast of Fools is heard\r\nof. The earliest notice I have come across is at the monastery of\r\nSt. Gall, hard by Constance, in 911. In that year King Conrad I was\r\nspending Christmas with Bishop Solomon of Constance. He heard so much\r\nof the Vespers processions during the _triduum_ at St. Gall that he\r\ninsisted on visiting the monastery, and arrived there in the midst of\r\nthe revels. It was all very amusing, and especially the procession of\r\nchildren, so grave and sedate that even when Conrad bade his train roll\r\napples along the aisle they did not budge[1176]. That the other Vespers\r\nprocessions of the _triduum_ were of deacons and priests may be taken\r\nfor granted. I do not know whether the _triduum_ originated at St.\r\nGall, but the famous song-school of that monastery was all-important\r\nin the movement towards the greater elaboration of church ceremonial,\r\nand even more of chant, which marked the tenth century. This gave rise\r\nto the tropes, of which much will be said in the next volume; and it is\r\nin a tropary, an English tropary from Winchester, dating from before\r\n980, that the feasts of the _triduum_ next occur. The ceremonies of\r\nthose feasts, as described by Belethus, belong mainly to the Office,\r\nand the tropes are mainly chanted elaborations of the text of the\r\nMass: but the Winchester tropes for the days of St. Stephen, St.\r\nJohn, and the Holy Innocents clearly imply the respective connexion\r\nof the services, to which they belong, with deacons, priests, and\r\nchoir-boys[1177]. Of the sub-deacons, on Circumcision or Epiphany,\r\nthere is as yet nothing. John of Avranches, Honorius of Autun, and\r\nBelethus bridge a gap, and from the thirteenth century the _triduum_\r\nis normal in service-books, both continental and English, throughout\r\nthe Middle Ages[1178]. It is provided for in the Nantes _Ordinarium_\r\nof 1263[1179], in the Amiens _Ordinarium_ of 1291[1180], and in the\r\nTours _Rituale_ of the fourteenth century[1181]. It required reforming\r\nat Vienne in 1385, but continued to exist there up to 1670[1182].\r\nIn the last three cases it is clearly marked side by side with, but\r\nother than, the Feast of Fools. In Germany, it is contemplated in the\r\n_Ritual_ of Mainz[1183]. In England I trace it at Salisbury[1184], at\r\nYork[1185], at Lincoln[1186], at St. Albans[1187]. These instances\r\ncould doubtless be multiplied, although there were certainly places\r\nwhere the special devotion of the three feasts to the three bodies\r\ndropped out at an early date. The Rheims _Ordinarium_ of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, for instance, knows nothing of it[1188]. The extent of the\r\nceremonies, again, would naturally be subject to local variation.\r\nThe germ of them lay in the procession at first Vespers described by\r\nEkkehard at St. Gall. But they often grew to a good deal more than\r\nthis. The deacons, priests, or choir-boys, as the case might be,\r\ntook the higher stalls, and the whole conduct of the services; the\r\n_Deposuit_ was sung; _epistolae farcitae_ were read[1189]; there was a\r\n_dominus festi_.\r\n\r\nThe main outlines of the feasts of the _triduum_ are thus almost\r\nexactly parallel, so far as the divine _servitium_ is concerned, to\r\nthose of the Feast of Fools, for which indeed they probably served as\r\na model. And like the Feast of Fools, they had their secular side,\r\nwhich often became riotousness. Occasionally they were absorbed in,\r\nor overshadowed by, the more popular and wilder merry-making of\r\nthe inferior clergy. But elsewhere they have their own history of\r\nreformations or suppression, or are grouped with the Feast of Fools,\r\nas by the decretal of Innocent III, in a common condemnation. The\r\ndiversity of local practice is well illustrated by the records of such\r\nacts of discipline. Sometimes, as at Paris[1190], or Soissons[1191],\r\nit is the deacons’ feast alone that has become an abuse; sometimes,\r\nas at Worms, that of the priests’[1192]; sometimes two of them[1193],\r\nsometimes all three[1194], require correction. I need only refer\r\nmore particularly to two interesting English examples. One is at\r\nWells, where a chapter statute of about 1331 condemns the tumult and\r\n_ludibrium_ with which divine service was celebrated from the Nativity\r\nto the octave of the Innocents, and in particular the _ludi theatrales_\r\nand _monstra larvarum_ introduced into the cathedral by the deacons,\r\npriests, sub-deacons, and even vicars during this period[1195]. Nor was\r\nthe abuse easy to check, for about 1338 a second statute was required\r\nto reinforce and strengthen the prohibition[1196]. So, too, in the\r\nneighbouring diocese of Exeter. The register of Bishop Grandisson\r\nrecords the mandates against _ludi inhonesti_ addressed by him in 1360\r\nto the chapters of Exeter cathedral, and of the collegiate churches\r\nof Ottery, Crediton, and Glasney. These _ludi_ were performed by\r\nmen and boys at Vespers, Matins, and Mass on Christmas and the three\r\nfollowing days. They amounted to a mockery of the divine worship, did\r\nmuch damage to the church vestments and ornaments, and brought the\r\nclergy into disrepute[1197]. These southern prohibitions are shortly\r\nbefore the final suppression of the Feast of Fools in the north at\r\nBeverley and Lincoln. The Wells customs, indeed, probably included\r\na regular Feast of Fools, for the part taken by the sub-deacons and\r\nvicars is specifically mentioned, and the proceedings lasted over the\r\nNew Year. But it is clear that even where the term ‘Feast of Fools’ is\r\nnot known to have been in use, the temper of that revel found a ready\r\nvent in other of the winter rejoicings. Nor was it the _triduum_ alone\r\nwhich afforded its opportunities. More rarely the performances of the\r\n_Pastores_ on Christmas day itself[1198], or the suppers given by the\r\ngreat officers of cathedrals and monasteries, when they sang their\r\n‘_Oes_,’ on the nights between December 16 and Christmas[1199], were\r\nthe occasions for excesses which called for reprehension.\r\n\r\nAlready, when Conrad visited St. Gall in 911, the third feast of the\r\n_triduum_ was the most interesting. In after years this reached an\r\nimportance denied to the other two. The Vespers procession was the\r\ngerm of an annual rejoicing, secular as well as ritual, which became\r\nfor the _pueri_ attached as choir-boys and servers to the cathedrals\r\nand great churches very much what the Feast of Fools became for the\r\nadult inferior clergy of the same bodies. Where the two feasts were not\r\nmerged in one, this distinction of _personnel_ was retained. A good\r\nexample is afforded by Sens. Here, from the middle of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, the chapter accounts show an _archiepiscopus puerorum_ side by\r\nside with the _dominus_ of the Feast of Fools. Each feast got its own\r\ngrant of wine from the chapter, and had its own prebend in the chapter\r\nwoods. In the fifteenth century the two fell and rose together. In the\r\nsixteenth, the Feast of Boys was the more flourishing, and claimed\r\ncertain dues from a market in Sens, which were commuted for a small\r\nmoney payment by the chapter. Finally, both feasts are suppressed\r\ntogether in 1547[1200]. It is to be observed that the original\r\ncelebration of the Holy Innocents’ day in the western Church was not of\r\nan unmixed festal character. It commemorated a martyrdom which typified\r\nand might actually have been that of Christ himself, and it was\r\ntherefore held _cum tristitia_. As in Lent or on Good Friday itself,\r\nthe ‘joyful chants,’ such as the _Te Deum_ or the _Alleluia_, were\r\nsilenced. This characteristic of the day was known to Belethus, but\r\neven before his time it had begun to give way to the festal tendencies.\r\nLocal practice differed widely, as the notices collected by Martene\r\nshow, but even when John of Avranches wrote, at the end of the eleventh\r\ncentury, the ‘modern’ custom was to sing the chants[1201].\r\n\r\nMany interesting details of the Feast of Boys, as it was celebrated\r\nin France, are contained in various ceremonial books. The _Officium\r\nInfantum_ of Rouen may be taken as typical[1202]. After second Vespers\r\non St. John’s day the boys marched out of the vestry, two by two, with\r\ntheir ‘bishop,’ singing _Centum quadraginta_. There was a procession to\r\nthe altar of the Holy Innocents, and _Hi empti sunt_ was sung[1203].\r\nThen the ‘bishop’ gave the Benediction. The feast of the following\r\nday was ‘double,’ but the boys might make it ‘triple,’ if they would.\r\nThere was a procession, with the _Centum quadraginta_, at Matins. At\r\nMass, the boys led the choir. At Vespers the _baculus_ was handed over,\r\nwhile the _Deposuit potentes_ was being sung[1204]. At Bayeux the feast\r\nfollowed the same general lines, but the procession at first Vespers\r\nwas to the altar, not of the Holy Innocents, but of St. Nicholas[1205].\r\nPrecise directions are given as to the functions of the ‘bishop.’ He is\r\nto wear a silk tunic and cope, and to have a mitre and pastoral staff,\r\nbut not a ring. The boys are to do him the same reverence that is done\r\nto the real bishop. There are also to be a boy _cantor_ and a boy\r\n‘chaplain.’ The ‘bishop’ is to perform the duties of a priest, so long\r\nas the feast lasts, except in the Mass. He is to give the benediction\r\nafter _Benedicamus_ at first Vespers. Then the boys are to take the\r\nhigher stalls, and to keep them throughout the following day, the\r\n‘bishop’ sitting in the dean’s chair. The boys are to say Compline as\r\nthey will. The ‘bishop’ is to be solemnly conducted home with the prose\r\n_Sedentem_, and on the following day he is to be similarly conducted\r\nboth to and from service. At Mass he is to cense and be censed like the\r\n‘great bishop’ on solemn occasions. He is also to give the benediction\r\nat Mass. There is a minute description of the ceremony of _Deposuit_,\r\nfrom which it is clear that, at Bayeux at least, the handing over of\r\nthe _baculus_ was from an incoming to an outgoing ‘bishop,’ to whom\r\nthe former was in turn to act as ‘chaplain[1206].’ The rubrics of the\r\nCoutances feast are even more minute[1207]. The proceedings began after\r\nMatins on St. John’s day, when the boys drew up a _tabula_ appointing\r\ntheir superiors to the minor offices of the coming feast. This,\r\nhowever, they were to do without impertinence[1208]. The vesting of the\r\n‘bishop’ and the Vespers procession are exactly described. As at Bayeux\r\nthe boys take the high stalls for Compline. The canon who holds a\r\nparticular prebend is bound to carry the candle and the _collectarium_\r\nfor the ‘bishop.’ After Compline the ‘bishop’ is led home with\r\n_Laetabundus_, but not in pontificals. Throughout the services of the\r\nfollowing day the ‘bishop’ plays his part, and when Vespers comes gives\r\nway to a ‘bishop’-elect at the _Deposuit_[1209]. The ‘bishop’ of St.\r\nMartin of Tours was installed in the neighbouring convent of Beaumont,\r\nwhither all the _clericuli_ rode for the purpose after Prime on St.\r\nJohn’s day. He was vested in the church there, blessed the nuns, then\r\nreturned to Tours, was installed in his own cathedral, and blessed the\r\npopulace[1210]. The secular side of the feast comes out in the Toul\r\n_Statutes_ of 1497[1211]. Here it may be said to have absorbed in its\r\nturn the Feast of Fools, for the ‘bishop’ was a choir-boy chosen by the\r\nchoir-boys themselves and also by the sub-deacons, who shared with them\r\nthe name of _Innocentes_[1212]. The election took place after Compline\r\non the first Sunday in Advent, and the ‘bishop’ was enthroned with a\r\n_Te Deum_. He officiated in the usual way throughout the Innocents’\r\nday services. In the morning he rode at the head of a _cortège_ to the\r\nmonasteries of St. Mansuetus and St. Aper, sang an anthem and said a\r\nprayer at the door of each church, and claimed a customary fee[1213].\r\nAfter Vespers he again rode in state with mimes and trumpeters through\r\nthe city[1214]. On the following day, all the ‘Innocents’ went masked\r\ninto the city, where, if it was fine enough, farces and apparently\r\nalso moralities and miracles were played[1215]. On the octave the\r\n‘bishop’ and his _cortège_ went to the church of St. Geneviève. After\r\nan anthem and collect they adjourned to the ‘church-house,’ where they\r\nwere entertained by the hospital at a dessert of cake, apples and\r\nnuts, during which they chose disciplinary officers for the coming\r\nyear[1216]. The expenses of the feast, with the exception of the dinner\r\non the day after Innocents’ day which came out of the disciplinary\r\nfines, are assigned by the statutes to the canons in the order of their\r\nappointment. The responsible canon must give a supper on Innocents’\r\nday, and a dessert out of what is over on the following day. He must\r\nalso provide the ‘bishop’ with a horse, gloves, and a _biretta_ when he\r\nrides abroad. At the supper a curious ceremony took place. The canon\r\nreturned thanks to the ‘bishop,’ apologized for any short-comings in\r\nthe preparations, and finally handed the ‘bishop’ a cap of rosemary or\r\nother flowers, which was then conferred upon the canon to whose lot it\r\nwould fall to provide the feast for the next anniversary[1217]. Should\r\nthe canon disregard his duties the boys and sub-deacons were entitled\r\nto hang up a black cope on a candlestick in the middle of the choir _in\r\nillius vituperium_ for as long as they might choose[1218].\r\n\r\nI cannot pretend to give a complete account of all the French\r\nexamples of the Boy Bishop with which I have met, and it is the less\r\nnecessary, as the feast seems to have been far more popular and\r\nenduring in England than the Feast of Fools. I content myself with\r\ngiving references for its history at Amiens[1219], St. Quentin[1220],\r\nSenlis[1221], Soissons[1222], Roye[1223], Peronne[1224], Rheims[1225],\r\nBrussels[1226], Lille[1227], Liège[1228], Laon[1229], Troyes[1230],\r\nMans[1231], Bourges[1232], Châlons-sur-Saône[1233], Grenoble[1234]. Not\r\nunnaturally it proved less of a scandal to ecclesiastical reformers\r\nthan the Feast of Fools; for the choir-boys must have been more\r\namenable to discipline, even in moments of festivity, than the adult\r\nclerks. But it shared in the general condemnation of all such customs,\r\nand was specifically arraigned by more than one council, rather perhaps\r\nfor puerility than for any graver offence[1235]. Gradually therefore,\r\nit vanished, leaving only a few survivals to recent centuries[1236].\r\nAs was the case with the Feast of Fools, the question of its\r\nsuppression sometimes set a chapter by the ears. Notably was this so\r\nat Noyon, where the act of his reforming colleagues in 1622 was highly\r\ndisapproved of by the dean, Jacques Le Vasseur. In a letter written on\r\nthe occasion he declares that the Boy Bishop had flourished in Noyon\r\ncathedral for four hundred years, and brands the reformers as brute\r\nbeasts masquerading in the robes and beards of philosophy[1237].\r\n\r\nI have no special records of the Boy Bishop in Spain except the council\r\ndecrees already quoted. In Germany he appears to have been more widely\r\npopular than his rival of Fools. My first notice, however, is two\r\ncenturies after the visit of Conrad to the _triduum_ at St. Gall. The\r\nchronicle of the monastery of St. Petersburg, hard by Halle, mentions\r\nan accident _in ludo qui vocatur puerorum_, by which a lad was trodden\r\nto death. This was in 1137[1238]. The thirteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies yield more examples. In 1249 Pope Innocent IV complained to\r\nthe bishop of Ratisbon that the clerks and scholars of that cathedral,\r\nwhen choosing their anniversary ‘bishop,’ did violence to the abbey\r\nof Pruviningen[1239]. In 1357 the Ratisbon feast was stained with\r\nhomicide, and was consequently suppressed[1240]. In 1282 the feast was\r\nforbidden at Eichstädt[1241]. In 1304 it led to a dispute between the\r\nmunicipality and the chapter of Hamburg, which ended in a promise by\r\nthe _scholares_ to refrain from defamatory songs either in Latin or\r\nGerman[1242]. Similarly at Worms in 1307 the _pueri_ were forbidden\r\nto sing in the streets after Compline, as had been the custom on\r\nthe feasts of St. Nicholas and St. Lucy, on Christmas and the three\r\nfollowing days, and on the octave of the Holy Innocents’[1243]. At\r\nLübeck the feast was abolished in 1336[1244]. I have already quoted the\r\nlong reference to the _scholarium episcopus_ in the Mosburg Gradual\r\nof 1360[1245]. He may be traced also at Regensburg[1246] and at\r\nPrague[1247]. But the fullest account of him is from Mainz[1248]. Here\r\nhe was called the _Schul-Bischoff_, and in derision _Apffeln-Bischoff_.\r\nHe was chosen before St. Nicholas’ day by the _ludi magister_ of the\r\n_schola trivialis_. He had his _equites_, his _capellani_, and his\r\n_pedelli_. On St. Nicholas’ day, and on that of the Holy Innocents’, he\r\nhad a seat near the high altar, and took part in the first and second\r\nVespers. In the interval he paid a visit with his company to the palace\r\nof the elector, sang a hymn[1249], and claimed a banquet or a donation.\r\nThe custom was not altogether extinct in Mainz by 1779[1250]. In other\r\nGerman towns, also, it well outlived the Middle Ages. At Cologne, for\r\ninstance, it was only suppressed by the statutes of Bishop Max Heinrich\r\nin 1662[1251].\r\n\r\nIn England, the Boy Bishop weathered the storms of discipline which\r\nswept away the Feast of Fools in the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies. He was widely popular in the later Middle Ages, and finally\r\nfell before an austerity of the Reformation. The prerogative instance\r\nof the custom is in the church of Salisbury. Here the existence of the\r\nBoy Bishop is already implied by the notice of a ring for use at the\r\n‘Feast of Boys’ in an inventory of 1222[1252]. A century later, the\r\nstatutes of Roger de Mortival in 1319 include elaborate regulations\r\nfor the ceremony. The ‘bishop’ may perform the _officium_ as is the\r\nuse, but he must hold no banquet, and no visitation either within or\r\nwithout the cathedral. He may be invited to the table of a canon, but\r\notherwise he must remain in the common house, and must return to his\r\nduties in church and school immediately after the feast of Innocents.\r\nThe statute also regulates the behaviour of the crowds which were wont\r\nto press upon and impede the boys in their annual procession to the\r\naltar of the Holy Trinity, and the rest of their ministry[1253]. Two\r\nof the great service-books of the Sarum use, the Breviary and the\r\nProcessional, give ample details as to the ‘ministry’ of the Boy Bishop\r\nand his fellows. The office, as preserved in these, will be found\r\nin an appendix[1254]. The proceedings differ in some respects from\r\nthe continental models already described. There is no mention of the\r\n_Deposuit_; and the central rite is still the great procession between\r\nVespers and Compline on the eve of the Holy Innocents. This procession\r\nwent from the choir either to the altar of the Holy Innocents or to\r\nthat of the Holy Trinity and All Saints in the Lady chapel, and at its\r\nreturn the boys took the higher stalls and kept them until the second\r\nVespers of the feast. For this procession the boys were entitled to\r\nassign the functions of carrying the book, the censer, the candles, and\r\nso forth to the canons. Some miscellaneous notices of the Salisbury\r\nfeast are contained in the chapter register between 1387 and 1473.\r\nFrom 1387 the oblations on the feast appear to have been given to the\r\n‘bishop.’ In 1413 he was allowed a banquet. In 1448 the precentor,\r\nNicholas Upton, proposed that the boys, instead of freely electing a\r\n‘bishop,’ should be confined to a choice amongst three candidates named\r\nby the chapter. But this innovation was successfully resisted[1255].\r\nCathedral documents also give the names of twenty-one boys who held\r\nthe office[1256]. There is in Salisbury cathedral a dwarf effigy of a\r\nbishop, dating from the latter part of the thirteenth century. Local\r\ntradition, from at least the beginning of the seventeenth century,\r\nhas regarded this as the monument of a Boy Bishop who died during his\r\nterm of office. But modern archaeologists repudiate the theory. Such\r\nminiature effigies are not uncommon, and possibly indicate that the\r\nheart alone of the person commemorated is buried in the spot which they\r\nmark[1257].\r\n\r\nThe gradual adoption of the use of Sarum by other dioceses would\r\nnaturally tend to carry with it that of the Boy Bishop. But he is\r\nto be found at Exeter and at St. Paul’s before the change of use,\r\nas well as at Lincoln and York which retained their own uses up to\r\nthe Reformation. At Exeter Bishop Grandisson’s _Ordinale_ of 1337\r\nprovides an _Officium puerorum_ for the eve and day of the Innocents\r\nwhich, with different detail, is on the same general lines as that of\r\nSalisbury[1258]. At St. Paul’s there was a Boy Bishop about 1225, when\r\na gift was made to him of a mitre by John de Belemains, prebendary\r\nof Chiswick. This appears, with other vestments for the feast, in an\r\ninventory drawn up some twenty years later[1259]. By 1263 abuses had\r\ngrown up, and the chapter passed a statute to reform them[1260]. They\r\nrequired the election of the _praesul_ and his chapter and the drawing\r\nup of the _tabula_ to take place in the chapter-house instead of in\r\nthe cathedral, on account of the irreverence of the crowds pressing to\r\nsee. The great dignitaries must not be put down on the _tabula_ for the\r\nservers’ functions, but only the clergy of the second or third ‘form.’\r\nThe procession and all the proceedings in the cathedral must be orderly\r\nand creditable to the boys[1261]. Minute directions follow as to the\r\nright of the ‘bishop’ to claim a supper on the eve from one of the\r\ncanons, and as to the train he may take with him, as well as for the\r\ndinner and supper of the feast-day itself. After dinner a cavalcade\r\nis to start from the cathedral for the blessing of the people. The\r\ndean must find a horse for the ‘bishop,’ and each canon residentiary\r\none for the lad who personates him[1262]. Other statutes of earlier\r\ndate make it incumbent on a new residentiary to entertain his own\r\nboy-representative _cum daunsa et chorea et torchiis_ on Innocents’\r\nday, and to sit up at night for the ‘bishop’ and all his _cortège_\r\non the octave. If he is kept up very late, he may ‘cut’ Matins next\r\nmorning[1263]. The Boy Bishop of St. Paul’s was accustomed to preach\r\na sermon which, not unnaturally, he did not write himself. William de\r\nTolleshunte, almoner of St. Paul’s in 1329, bequeathed to the almonry\r\ncopies of all the sermons preached by the Boy Bishops in his time.\r\nProbably he was himself responsible for them[1264]. One such sermon was\r\nprinted by Wynkyn de Worde before 1500[1265]. Another was written by\r\nErasmus, and exists both in Latin and English[1266]. When Dean Colet\r\ndrew up the statutes of St. Paul’s School in 1512 he was careful to\r\nenact that the scholars should attend the cathedral on Childermass day,\r\nhear the sermon, and mass, and give a penny to the ‘bishop[1267].’\r\n\r\nThe earliest notice of the Boy Bishop at York, or for the matter of\r\nthat, in England, is in a statute (before 1221), which lays on him the\r\nduty of finding rushes for the Nativity and Epiphany feasts[1268].\r\nAfter this, there is nothing further until the second half of the\r\nfourteenth century, when some interesting documents become available.\r\nThe chapter register for 1367 requires that in future the ‘bishop’\r\nshall be the boy who has served longest and proved most useful in\r\nthe cathedral. A saving clause is added: _dum tamen competenter sit\r\ncorpore formosus_[1269]. This shows a sense of humour in the chapter,\r\nfor at York, as at Salisbury, _Corpore enim formosus es, O fili_ was a\r\nrespond for the day. In 1390, was added a further qualification that\r\nthe ‘bishop’ must be a lad in good voice[1270]. Doubtless the office\r\nwas much coveted, for it was a very remunerative one. The visitation\r\nforbidden at Salisbury by Roger de Mortival was permitted at York,\r\nand the profits were considerable. Robert de Holme, who was ‘bishop’\r\nin 1369, received from the choirmaster, John Gisson, who acted as his\r\ntreasurer, no less a sum than £3 15_s._ 1¹⁄₂_d._[1271] In 1396 the\r\namount was only £2 0_s._ 6¹⁄₂_d._ But this was only a small portion\r\nof the total receipts. The complete _Computus_ for this year happens\r\nto be preserved, and shows that the Boy Bishop made a _quête_ at\r\nintervals during the weeks between Christmas and Candlemas, travelling\r\nwith a ‘seneschal,’ four singers and a servant to such distant places\r\nas Bridlington, Leeds, Beverley, Fountains abbey and Allerton. Their\r\nprincipal journey lasted a fortnight. The oblations on Christmas and\r\nInnocents’ days and the collection from the dignitaries in the cloister\r\nrealized £2 15_s._ 5_d._ In the city they got 10_s._ and abroad £5\r\n10_s._ Out of this there were heavy expenses. The supper given by\r\nthe ‘bishop’ cost 15_s._ 6¹⁄₂_d._ Purchased meals had to supplement\r\nhospitality at home and abroad. Horse hire and stable expenses had\r\nto be met. There were the ‘bishop’s’ outfit, candles to be borne in\r\nprocession, fees to the minor cathedral officials, gloves for presents\r\nto the vicars and schoolmasters. There was the ‘bishop’s’ own company\r\nto be rewarded for its services. The £2 0_s._ 6¹⁄₂_d._ represents\r\nthe balance available for his private use[1272]. The most generous\r\ncontributor to the _quête_ was the countess of Northumberland, who\r\ngave 20s. and a gold ring. This is precisely the amount of the reward\r\nprescribed about 1522 for the ‘barne bishop’ of York, as well as for\r\nhis brother of Beverley in the _Household Book_ of the fifth earl of\r\nNorthumberland[1273].\r\n\r\nThe printed service-books of the use of York do not deal as fully\r\nwith the Feast of Boys as do those of Sarum; but a manuscript missal\r\nof the fifteenth century used in the cathedral itself contains some\r\nadditional rubrics with regard to the functions of the ‘bishop’ and\r\nhis ‘precentor’ at Mass[1274]. The names of some of the York ‘bishops’\r\nare preserved, and show that the ceremony prevailed up to the\r\nReformation[1275]. And this is confirmed by a list of ornaments for the\r\n‘bishop’ in a sixteenth-century inventory[1276].\r\n\r\nI am unable to give such full data for Lincoln as for the cathedrals\r\nalready named; but regulations of 1300 and 1527 provide for the\r\nsupply of candles to the ‘bishop’ and the rest of the choir at\r\nVespers on the eve and matins on the day of the Innocents[1277], and\r\nan inventory of 1536 mentions a cope for the ‘barne busshop’ with a\r\nmoral ‘scriptur’ embroidered on it[1278]. Nor can I hope to supply any\r\nexhaustive list of localities where the Boy Bishop flourished. These\r\ninclude minor cathedrals such as Hereford[1279], Lichfield[1280],\r\nGloucester[1281], and Norwich[1282], great collegiate churches such\r\nas Beverley minster[1283], St. Peter’s, Canterbury[1284], and Ottery\r\nSt. Mary’s[1285], college chapels such as Magdalen[1286] and All\r\nSouls[1287], at Oxford, the private chapels of the king[1288] and\r\nthe earl of Northumberland[1289], and many parish churches both in\r\nLondon[1290], and throughout the length and breadth of England[1291]\r\nand Scotland[1292].\r\n\r\nNor is this all. Unlike the Feast of Fools, the Feast of Boys enjoyed\r\na considerable vogue in religious houses. When John Peckham,\r\narchbishop of Canterbury, was drawing up his constitutions for such\r\ncommunities in 1279, he found it necessary to limit the duration of\r\nthis feast to the eve and day of the Holy Innocents[1293]. Traces of\r\nthe Boy Bishop are to be found in the archives of more than one great\r\nmonastery. A Westminster inventory of 1388 gives minute descriptions\r\nof vestments and ornaments for his use, many of which appear to have\r\nbeen quite recently provided by the ‘westerer’ or _vestiarius_, Richard\r\nTonworthe[1294]. There was a mitre with silvered and gilt plates and\r\ngems, and the inscription _Sancte Nicholae ora pro nobis_ set in\r\npearls. There was a _baculus_ with images of St. Peter and St. Edward\r\nthe Confessor upon thrones. There were two pair of cheveril gloves, to\r\nmatch the mitre. There were an amice, a rochet and a surplice. There\r\nwere two albs and a cope of blood colour worked with gryphons and other\r\nbeasts and cisterns spouting water. There was another ‘principal’\r\ncope of ruby and blood-coloured velvet embroidered in gold, and with\r\nthe ‘new arms of England’ woven into it. An older mitre and pair of\r\ngloves and a ring had been laid aside as old-fashioned or worn out.\r\nEvidently the feast was celebrated with some splendour. Several of\r\nthe vestments are again inventoried in 1540[1295]. A payment for the\r\nfeast is recorded in a _Computus_ of 1413-14[1296]. The accounts\r\nof the obedientiaries of Durham priory show from 1369 onwards many\r\npayments by nearly all these officers to a Boy Bishop of the almonry.\r\nHe also received a gift up to 1528 from the dependent house or ‘cell’\r\nof Finchale priory. This payment was made at the office of the\r\n_feretrarius_ or keeper of Saint Cuthbert’s shrine. The ‘bishop’ is\r\ncalled _episcopus puerilis_, _episcopus eleemosynariae_, or the like.\r\nIn 1405 he was not elected, _propter guerras eo tempore_. In 1423 and\r\n1434 there was also an _episcopus de Elvett_ or Elvetham, a manor of\r\nthe priory[1297]. The abbey of Bury St. Edmunds had its _episcopus\r\nsancti Nicolai_ in 1418 and for at least a century longer[1298].\r\nAt Winchester each of the great monasteries held a Feast of Boys;\r\nthe abbey of Hyde on St. Nicholas’ day[1299]; the priory of St.\r\nSwithin’s on that of the Holy Innocents. Here, too, the accounts of\r\nthe obedientiaries contain evidence of the feast in payments between\r\n1312 and 1536 for beer or wine sent to the _episcopus iuvenum_.\r\nNearly all the officers whose rolls are preserved, the chamberlain,\r\nthe curtarian, the cellarian, the almoner, the sacristan, the _custos\r\noperum_, the hordarian, seem to have contributed[1300]. A _Computus_\r\nof 1441 contains a payment to the _pueri eleemosynariae_ who, with\r\nthe _pueri_ of St. Elizabeth’s chapel, visited St. Mary’s convent,\r\ndressed as girls, and danced, sang and sported before the abbess and\r\nthe nuns[1301]. We have had some French instances in which the Boy\r\nBishop visited a neighbouring convent. But the nuns were not always\r\ndependent on outside visitors for their revel. In some places they held\r\ntheir own feast, with an ‘abbess’ instead of a ‘bishop.’ Archbishop\r\nJohn Peckham, in addition to his general constitution already quoted,\r\nissued a special mandate to Godstow nunnery, forbidding the office\r\nand prayers to be said _per parvulas_ on Innocents’ day[1302]. Three\r\ncenturies later, in 1526, a visitation of Carrow nunnery by Richard\r\nNicke, bishop of Norwich, disclosed a custom of electing a Christmas\r\n‘abbess’ there, which the bishop condemned[1303]. Continental parallels\r\nto these examples are available. An eighth-century case, indeed,\r\nwhich is quoted by some writers, has probably been the subject of\r\na misinterpretation[1304]. But the visitation-books of Odo Rigaud,\r\narchbishop of Rouen (1248-69) record that he forbade the _ludibria_\r\nof the younger nuns at the Christmas feasts and the feast of St. Mary\r\nMagdalen in more than one convent of his diocese. One of these was the\r\nconvent of the Holy Trinity at Caen, in which an ‘abbess’ was still\r\nchosen by the novices in 1423[1305]. All the monastic examples here\r\nquoted come from houses of the older foundations. The _Statutes_,\r\nhowever, of the Observant Franciscans made at Barcelona in 1401,\r\nexpressly forbid the use of secular garments or the loan of habits of\r\nthe order for _ludi_ on St. Nicholas’ or Innocents’ days[1306]; whence\r\nit may be inferred that the irregularities provided against were not\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nMediaeval education began with the song-school: and although the\r\nuniversities and other great seats of learning came to be much more\r\nthan glorified choirs, they still retained certain traces of their\r\nhumble origin. Amongst these was the Boy Bishop. The students of Paris\r\nregularly chose their Boy Bishops on St. Nicholas’ day. In 1275,\r\nindeed, the Faculty of Arts forbade the torchlight processions which\r\ntook place on that day and on St. Catherine’s, the two great common\r\nholidays of the clerks[1307]. But in 1367 such processions were held\r\nas of ancient custom, and it would appear that every little group of\r\nstudents gathered together under the protection and in the house of a\r\nmaster of arts considered itself entitled to choose a ‘bishop,’ and to\r\nlead him in a rout through the streets. In that year the custom led\r\nto a tragic brawl which came under the cognizance of the _Parlement_\r\nof Paris[1308]. The scholars of one Peter de Zippa, dwelling _in vico\r\nBucherie ultra Parvum Pontem_, had chosen as ‘bishop’ Bartholomew\r\nDivitis of Ypres. On St. Nicholas’ eve, they were promenading, with\r\na torch but unarmed, to the houses of the rector of the Faculty and\r\nothers _causa solacii et iocosa_, when they met with the watch. Peter\r\nde Zippa was with them, and the watch had a grudge against Peter. On\r\nthe previous St. Catherine’s day they had arrested him, but he had been\r\nreleased by the _préfet_. They now attacked the procession with drawn\r\nswords, and wounded Jacobus de Buissono in the leg. As the scholars\r\nwere remonstrating, up came Philippus de Villaribus, _miles gueti_, and\r\nBernardus Blondelli, his deputy, and cried ‘_Ad mortem_’. The scholars\r\nfled home, but the watch made an attack on the house. Peter de Zippa\r\nattempted to appease them from a window, and was wounded four fingers\r\nfrom a mortal spot. As the watch were on the point of breaking in, the\r\nscholars surrendered. The house was looted, and the inmates beaten.\r\nOne lad was pitched out on his head and driven into the Seine, out of\r\nwhich he was helped by a woman. Peter de Zippa and twenty-four others\r\nwere rolled in the mud and then carried off to the _Châtelet_, where\r\nthey were shut up in a dark and malodorous cell. Worst of all, the\r\n‘bishop’ had disappeared altogether. It was believed that the watch had\r\nslain him, and flung the body into the Seine. A complaint was brought\r\nbefore the _Parlement_, and a commission of inquiry appointed. The\r\nwatch declared that Peter de Zippa was insubordinate to authority and,\r\nalthough warned, as a foreigner, both in French and Latin[1309], that\r\nthey were the king’s men, persisted in hurling logs and stones out of\r\nhis window, with the result of knocking four teeth out of Peter Patou’s\r\nmouth, and wounding the horse of Philip de Villaribus. This defence was\r\napparently thought unsatisfactory, and a further inquiry was held, with\r\nthe aid of torture. Finally the court condemned the offending watch\r\nto terms of imprisonment and the payment of damages. They had also to\r\noffer a humble apology, with bare head and bent knee, to the bishop\r\nof Paris, the rector of the Faculty, Peter de Zippa, and the injured\r\nscholars, in the cloister or the chapter-house of St. Mathurin’s. The\r\ncase of the alleged murder of the ‘bishop,’ Bartholomew Divitis, was\r\nnot to be prejudiced by this judgement, and Peter de Zippa was warned\r\nto be more submissive to authority in future. The whole episode is an\r\ninteresting parallel to the famous ‘town and gown’ at Oxford on St.\r\nScholastica’s day, 1353[1310].\r\n\r\nProvision is made for a Boy Bishop in the statutes of more than one\r\ngreat English educational foundation. William of Wykeham ordained\r\nin 1400 that one should be chosen at Winchester College, and at New\r\nCollege, Oxford, and should recite the office at the Feast of the\r\nInnocents[1311]. Some notices in the Winchester College accounts\r\nduring the fifteenth century show that he also presided at secular\r\nrevels. In 1462 he is called _Episcopus Nicholatensis_, and on St.\r\nNicholas’ day he paid a visit of ceremony to the warden, who presented\r\nhim, out of the college funds, with fourpence[1312]. The example of\r\nWilliam of Wykeham was followed, forty years later, in the statutes of\r\nthe royal foundations of Eton College and King’s College, Cambridge.\r\nBut there was one modification. These colleges were dedicated to\r\nthe Virgin and to St. Nicholas, and it was carefully laid down that\r\nthe performance of the _officium_ by the ‘bishop’ was to be on St.\r\nNicholas’ day, ‘and by no means on that of the Innocents[1313].’\r\nThe Eton ‘bishop’ is said by the Elizabethan schoolmaster Malim,\r\nwho wrote a _Consuetudinarium_ of the college in 1561, to have been\r\ncalled _episcopus Nihilensis_, and to have been chosen on St. Hugh’s\r\nday (November 17). Probably _Nihilensis_ is a scribal mistake for\r\n_Nicholatensis_[1314]. The custom had been abolished before Malim\r\nwrote, but was extant in 1507, for in that year the ‘bishop’s’ rochet\r\nwas mended[1315]. Some Eton historians have thought that the Boy Bishop\r\nceremony was the origin of the famous ‘Montem’; but as the ‘Montem’\r\nwas held on the feast of the Conversion of St. Paul (January 25), and\r\nas Malim mentions both customs independently, this is improbable[1316].\r\n\r\nSmaller schools than Winchester or Eton had none the less their Boy\r\nBishops. Archbishop Rotherham, who founded in 1481 a college at his\r\nnative place of Rotherham in Yorkshire, left by will in 1500 a mitre\r\nfor the ‘barnebishop[1317].’ The grammar school at Canterbury had, or\r\nshould have had, its Boy Bishop in 1464[1318]. Aberdeen was a city of\r\nwhich St. Nicholas was the patron, and at Aberdeen the master of the\r\ngrammar school was paid by a collection taken when he went the rounds\r\nwith the ‘bishop’ on St. Nicholas’ day[1319]. Dean Colet, on the other\r\nhand, when founding St. Paul’s school did not provide for a ‘bishop’\r\nin the school itself, but, as we have seen, directed the scholars to\r\nattend the mass and sermon of the ‘bishop’ in the cathedral.\r\n\r\nNaturally the Reformation made war on the Boy Bishop. A royal\r\nproclamation of July 22, 1541, forbade the ‘gatherings’ by children\r\n‘decked and apparalid to counterfaite priestes, bysshopps, and women’\r\non ‘sainte Nicolas, sainte Catheryne, sainte Clement, the holye\r\nInnocentes, and such like,’ and also the singing of mass and preaching\r\nby boys on these days[1320]. Naturally also, during the Marian reaction\r\nthe Boy Bishop reappeared. On November 13, 1554, Bishop Bonner issued\r\nan order permitting all clerks in the diocese of London to have St.\r\nNicholas and to go abroad; and although this order was annulled on\r\nthe very eve of the festival, apparently because Cardinal Pole had\r\nappointed St. Nicholas’ day for a great ceremony of reconciliation\r\nat Lambeth, yet the custom was actually revived in several London\r\nparishes, including St. Andrew’s, Holborn, and St. Nicholas Olave,\r\nBread Street[1321]. In 1556 it was still more widely observed[1322].\r\nBut upon the accession of Elizabeth it naturally fell again into\r\ndisuse, and it has left few, if any, traces in modern folk-custom[1323].\r\n\r\nI need not, after the last two chapters, attempt an elaborate analysis\r\nof the customs connected with the Boy Bishop. In the main they are\r\nparallel to those of the Feast of Fools. They include the burlesque\r\nof divine service, the _quête_, the banquet, the _dominus festi_.\r\nLike the Feast of Fools, they probably contain a folk as well as an\r\necclesiastical element. But the former is chastened and subdued, the\r\nstrength of ecclesiastical discipline having proved sufficient, in\r\nthe case of the boys, to bar for the most part such excesses as the\r\nadult clerks inherited from the pagan Kalends. On one point, however,\r\na little more must be said. The _dominus festi_, who at the Feast of\r\nFools bears various names, is almost invariably at the Feast of Boys\r\na ‘bishop[1324].’ This term must have been familiar by the end of\r\nthe eleventh century for it lends a point of sarcasm to the protest\r\nmade by Yves, bishop of Chartres, in a letter to Pope Urban II against\r\nthe disgraceful nomination by Philip I of France of a wanton lad to\r\nbe bishop of Orleans in 1099[1325]. In later documents it appears in\r\nvarious forms, _episcopus puerorum_, _episcopellus_[1326], _episcopus\r\npuerilis_ or _parvulus_, ‘boy bishop,’ ‘child bishop,’ ‘barne\r\nbishop.’ In some English monasteries it is _episcopus eleemosynariae_\r\n(‘of the almonry’); in Germany, _Schul-Bischof_, or, derisively,\r\n_Apfeln-Bischof_. More significant than any of these is the common\r\nvariant _episcopus Nicholatensis_, ‘Nicholas bishop.’ For St. Nicholas’\r\nday (December 6) was hardly less important in the career of the Boy\r\nBishop than that of the Holy Innocents itself. At this feast he was\r\ngenerally chosen and began his _quête_ through the streets. In more\r\nthan one locality, Mainz for instance in Germany, Eton in England,\r\nit was on this day as well as, or in substitution for, that of the\r\nInnocents that he made his appearance in divine service[1327]. St.\r\nNicholas was, of course, the patron saint of schoolboys and of\r\nchildren generally[1328]. His prominence in the winter processions\r\nof Germany and the presents which in modern folk-belief he brings to\r\nchildren have been touched upon in an earlier chapter. It now appears\r\nthat originally he took rather than gave presents, and that where he\r\nappeared in person he was represented by the Boy Bishop. And this\r\nsuggests the possibility that it was this connexion with St. Nicholas,\r\nand not the profane mummings of Michael the Drunkard at Constantinople,\r\nwhich led to the use of the term ‘bishop’ for the _dominus festi_,\r\nfirst at the Feast of Boys, and ultimately at the other Christmas\r\nfeasts as well. For St. Nicholas was not only the boys’ saint _par\r\nexcellence_; he was also, owing to the legend of his divinely ordered\r\nconsecration when only a layman as bishop of Myra, the bishop saint\r\n_par excellence_[1329]. However this may be, I think it is a fair guess\r\nthat St. Nicholas’ day was an older date for a Feast of Boys than that\r\nof the Holy Innocents, and that the double date records an instance of\r\nthe process, generally imperfect, by which, under Roman and Christian\r\ninfluence, the beginning of winter customs of the Germano-Keltic\r\npeoples were gradually transformed into mid-winter customs[1330].\r\nThe beginning of winter feast was largely a domestic feast, and the\r\nchildren probably had a special part in it. It is possible also to\r\ntrace a survival of the corresponding beginning of summer feast in the\r\nday of St. Gregory on March 12, which was also sometimes marked by the\r\nelection of a _Schul-Bischof_[1331].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n                      GUILD FOOLS AND COURT FOOLS\r\n\r\n    [_Bibliographical Note._--The best account of the _Sociétés\r\n    joyeuses_ is that of L. Petit de Julleville, _Les Comédiens en\r\n    France au Moyen Âge_ (1889). Much material is collected in the\r\n    same writer’s _Répertoire du Théâtre comique en France au Moyen\r\n    Âge_ (1886), and in several of the books given as authorities on\r\n    the Feast of Fools (ch. xiii), especially those of Du Tilliot,\r\n    Rigollot, Leber, and Grenier. Mme. Clément (née Hémery),\r\n    _Histoire des Fêtes civiles et religieuses du Département du\r\n    Nord_ (1832), may also be consulted. M. Petit de Julleville’s\r\n    account of the _Sottie_ is supplemented by E. Picot, _La Sottie\r\n    en France_, in _Romania_, vol. vii, and there is a good study of\r\n    the fool-literature of the Renascence in C. H. Herford, _Literary\r\n    Relations between England and Germany in the Sixteenth Century_\r\n    (1886). Amongst writers on the court fool are J. F. Dreux du\r\n    Radier, _Histoire des Fous en Titre d’Office_, in _Récréations\r\n    historiques_ (1768); C. F. Flögel, _Geschichte der Hofnarren_\r\n    (1789); F.

Much of this literature fails\r\n    to distinguish between the _stultus_ and the _ioculator regis_\r\n    (ch. iii). There is an admirable essay by L. Johnson on _The\r\n    Fools of Shakespeare_ in _Noctes Shakesperianae_ (1887).]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of this volume must call attention to certain traces\r\nleft by the ecclesiastical _ludi_ of the New Year, themselves extinct,\r\nupon festival custom, and, through this, upon dramatic tradition. The\r\nFeast of Fools did not altogether vanish with its suppression in the\r\ncathedrals. It had had its origin in the popular celebration of the\r\nKalends. Throughout it did not altogether lack a popular element. The\r\n_bourgeois_ crowded into the cathedral to see and share in the revel.\r\nThe Fool Bishop in his turn left the precincts and made his progress\r\nthrough the city streets, while his satellites played their pranks\r\nabroad for the entertainment of the mob. The feast was a dash of colour\r\nin the civic as well as the ecclesiastical year. The Tournai riots of\r\n1499 show that the _jeunesse_ of that city had come to look upon it\r\nas a _spectacle_ which they were entitled to claim from the cathedral.\r\nWhat happened in Tournai doubtless happened elsewhere. And the upshot\r\nof it was that when in chapter after chapter the reforming party got\r\nthe upper hand and the official celebration was dropped, the city and\r\nits _jeunesse_ themselves stepped into the breach and took measures\r\nto perpetuate the threatened delightful dynasty. It was an easy way\r\nto avert the loss of a holiday. And so we find a second tradition\r\nof Feasts of Fools, in which the _fous_ are no longer vicars but\r\n_bourgeois_, and the _dominus festi_ is a popular ‘king’ or ‘prince’\r\nrather than a clerical ‘bishop.’ A mid-fifteenth-century writer, Martin\r\nFranc, attests the vogue of the _prince des folz_ in the towns of\r\nnorthern France:\r\n\r\n    ‘Va t’en aux festes à Tournay,\r\n      A celles d’Arras et de Lille,\r\n    D’Amiens, de Douay, de Cambray,\r\n      De Valenciennes, d’Abbeville.\r\n      Là verras tu des gens dix mille,\r\n    Plus qu’en la forest de Torfolz,\r\n      Qui servent par sales, par viles,\r\n    A ton dieu, le prince des folz[1332].’\r\n\r\nThe term _Roi_ or _Prince des Sots_ is perhaps the most common one\r\nfor the new _dominus festi_, and, like _sots_ or _folz_ themselves,\r\nis generic. But there are many local variants, as the _Prévôt des\r\nÉtourdis_ at Bouchain[1333], the _Roi des Braies_ at Laon, the _Roi\r\nde l’Epinette_ at Lille, and the _Prince de la Jeunesse_ at St.\r\nQuentin[1334]. The _dominus festi_ was as a rule chosen by one or more\r\nlocal guilds or _confréries_ into which the _jeunesse_ were organized\r\nfor the purpose of maintaining the feast. The fifteenth century was an\r\nage of guilds in every department of social life, and the _compagnies\r\ndes fous_ or _sociétés joyeuses_ are but the frivolous counterparts\r\nof religious _confréries_ or literary _puys_. The most famous of all\r\nsuch _sociétés_, that of _l’Infanterie Dijonnaise_ at Dijon, seems\r\ndirectly traceable to the fall of an ecclesiastical Feast of Fools.\r\nSuch a feast was held, as we have seen, in the ducal, afterwards royal,\r\nchapel, and was abolished by the _Parlement_ of Dijon in 1552. Before\r\nthis date nothing is heard of _l’Infanterie_. A quarter of a century\r\nlater it is in full swing, and the character of its dignitaries and\r\nits badges point clearly to a derivation from the chapel feast[1335].\r\nThe Dijon example is but a late one of a development which had long\r\ntaken place in many parts of northern France and Flanders. It would be\r\ndifficult to assert that a _société joyeuse_ never made its appearance\r\nin any town before the ecclesiastical Feast of Fools had died out\r\ntherein. Occasionally the two institutions overlap[1336]. But, roughly\r\nspeaking, the one is the inheritor of the other; ‘_La confrérie des\r\nsots, c’est la Fête des Fous sécularisée_[1337].’ Amongst the chief of\r\nthese _sociétés_ are the _Enfants-sans-Souci_ of Paris, the _Cornards_\r\nor _Connards_ of Rouen and Evreux[1338], the _Suppôts du Seigneur de\r\nla Coquille_ of Lyons[1339]. The history of these has been written\r\nexcellently well by M. Petit de Julleville, and I do not propose to\r\nrepeat it. A few general points, however, deserve attention.\r\n\r\nThe ecclesiastical Feast of Fools flourished rather in cathedrals\r\nthan in monasteries. The _sociétés_ however, like some more serious\r\n_confréries_[1340], seem to have preferred a conventual to a capitular\r\nmodel for their organization[1341]. The _Cornards_, both at Rouen\r\nand Evreux, were under an _Abbé_. Cambrai had its _Abbaye joyeuse de\r\nLescache-Profit_, Chalons-sur-Saône its _Abbé de la Grande Abbaye_,\r\nArras its _Abbé de Liesse_, Poitiers its _Abbé de Mau Gouverne_[1342].\r\nThe literary adaptation of this idea by Rabelais in the _Abbaye de\r\nThélème_ is familiar. This term _abbaye_ is common to the _sociétés_,\r\nwith some at least of the _Basoches_ or associations of law-clerks\r\nto the _Parlements_ of Paris and the greater provincial towns. The\r\n_Basoches_ existed for mutual protection, but for mutual amusement\r\nalso, and on one side at least of their activity they were much of the\r\nnature of _sociétés joyeuses_[1343]. At Rheims in 1490 a _Basoche_\r\nentered into rivalry of dramatic invective with the celebrants of the\r\necclesiastical Feast of Fools[1344]. The _Basoche_ of Paris was in the\r\nclosest relations to, if not actually identical with, the _société_ of\r\nthe _Enfants-sans-Souci_[1345]. Just as the law-clerks of Paris were\r\nbanded together in their _Basoche_, so were the students of Paris in\r\ntheir ‘university,’ ‘faculties,’ ‘nations,’ and other groups; and in\r\n1470, long after the regular Feast of Fools had disappeared from the\r\ncity, the students were still wont to put on the fool habit and elect\r\ntheir _rex fatuorum_ on Twelfth night[1346]. Yet other guilds of a more\r\nserious character, generally speaking, than the _sociétés joyeuses_,\r\nnone the less occasionally gave themselves over to _joyeuseté_. The\r\n_Deposuit_ brought rebuke upon religious _confréries_ up to a quite\r\nlate date[1347]; and traces of the _fous_ are to be found amongst the\r\nrecreations of no less a body than the famous and highly literary _puy_\r\nof Arras. The _sociétés joyeuses_, like the _puys_, were primarily\r\nassociations of amateur, rather than professional merry-makers, a fact\r\nwhich distinguishes them from the corporations of minstrels described\r\nin a previous chapter[1348]. But minstrels and _trouvères_ were by\r\nno means excluded. The poet Gringoire was _Mère-Sotte_ of the Paris\r\n_Enfants-sans-Souci_. Clément Marot was a member of the same body. In\r\nthe _puy_ of Arras the minstrels traditionally held an important place;\r\nand as the literary and dramatic side of the _sociétés_ grew, it is\r\nevident that the men who were professionally ready with their pens\r\nmust everywhere have been in demand.\r\n\r\nThe primary function of the _sociétés joyeuses_ and their congeners\r\nwas the celebration of the traditional Feast of Fools at or about\r\nthe New Year. In Paris, Twelfth night was a day of festival for the\r\n_Basoche_ as well as for the minor association of exchequer clerks\r\nknown as the _Empire de Galilée_. In mid-January came the _fête des\r\nBraies_ at Laon, and the _fête_ of the _Abbaye de Lescache-Profit_ at\r\nCambrai. That of the _Prince des Sots_ at Amiens was on the first of\r\nJanuary itself[1349]. On the same day three _sociétés joyeuses_ united\r\nin a _fête de l’âne_ at Douai[1350]. But January was no clement month\r\nfor the elaborated revels of increasingly luxurious burghers; and it\r\nis not surprising to find that many of the _sociétés_ transferred\r\ntheir attention to other popular feasts which happened to fall at more\r\ngenial seasons of the year. To the celebration of these, the spring\r\nfeast of the carnival or Shrovetide, the summer feasts of May-day or\r\nMidsummer, they brought all the wantonness of the Feast of Fools.\r\nThe _Infanterie Dijonnaise_, the _Cornards_ of Rouen and Evreux, the\r\nthird Parisian law association, that of the _Châtelet_, especially\r\ncultivated the carnival. The three obligatory feasts of the _Basoche_\r\nincluded, besides that of Twelfth night, one on May-day and one at the\r\nbeginning of July[1351]. On May-day, too, a guild in the parish of\r\nSt. Germain at Amiens held its _fête des fous_[1352]. It may be noted\r\nthat these summer extensions of the reign of folly are not without\r\nparallels of a strictly ecclesiastical type. At Châlons-sur-Marne, as\r\nlate as 1648, a chapter procession went to the woods on St. John’s eve\r\nto cut boughs for the decking of the church[1353]. At Evreux a similar\r\ncustom grew into a very famous revel[1354]. This was the _procession\r\nnoire_, otherwise known as the _cérémonie de la Saint-Vital_, because\r\nthe proceedings began on the day of St. Vitalis (April 28) and lasted\r\nto the second Vespers on May 1. Originally the canons, afterwards the\r\nchoir-clerks, chaplains, and vicars, went at day-break on May morning\r\nto gather branches in the bishop’s woods. Their return was the signal\r\nfor riotous proceedings. The bells were violently rung. Masks were\r\nworn. Bran was thrown in the eyes of passers-by, and they were made to\r\nleap over broomsticks. The choir-clerks took the high stalls, and the\r\nchoir-boys recited the office. In the intervals the canons played at\r\nskittles over the vaults; there were dancing and singing and the rest,\r\n‘as at the time of the Nativity[1355].’ The abuses of this festival\r\nmust have begun at an early date, for two canons of the cathedral, one\r\nof whom died in 1206, are recorded to have been hung out of the belfry\r\nwindows in a vain attempt to stop the bell-ringing. Its extension\r\nto St. Vitalis’ day is ascribed to another canon, singularly named\r\nBouteille, who is said to have founded about 1270 a very odd _obit_. He\r\ndesired that a pall should lie on the pavement of the choir, and that\r\non each corner and in the middle of this should stand a bottle of wine,\r\nto be drunk by the singing-men. The canon Bouteille may be legendary,\r\nbut the wine-bottle figured largely in the festival ceremonies. While\r\nthe branches were distributed in the bishop’s wood, which came to be\r\nknown as the _bois de la Bouteille_, the company drank and ate cakes.\r\nTwo bottle-shaped holes were dug in the earth and filled with sand.\r\nOn the day of the _obit_ an enormous leather bottle, painted with\r\nmarmosets, serpents, and other grotesques, was placed in the choir.\r\nThese rites were still extant at Evreux in 1462, when a fresh attempt\r\nto suppress the bell-jangling led to a fresh riot. No explanation is\r\ngiven of the term _procession noire_ as used at Evreux, but a Vienne\r\nparallel suggests that, as in some other seasonal festivals, those who\r\ntook part in the procession had their faces blacked. At Vienne, early\r\non May 1, four men, naked and black, started from the archbishop’s\r\npalace and paraded the city. They were chosen respectively by the\r\narchbishop, the cathedral chapter, and the abbots of St. Peter’s and\r\nSt. John’s. Subsequently they formed a _cortège_ for a _rex_, also\r\nchosen by the archbishop, and a _regina_ from the convent of St.\r\nAndrew’s. A St. Paul, from the hospital dedicated to that saint, also\r\njoined in the procession, and carried a cup of ashes which he sprinkled\r\nin the faces of those he met. This custom lasted to the seventeenth\r\ncentury[1356].\r\n\r\nBut the seasonal feasts did not exhaust the activities of the\r\n_sociétés_. Occasional events, a national triumph, a royal entry, not\r\nto speak of local _faits divers_, found them ready with appropriate\r\ncelebrations[1357]. The _Infanterie Dijonnaise_ made a solemn\r\nfunction of the admission of new members[1358]. And more than one\r\n_société_ picked up from folk-custom the tradition of the _charivari_,\r\nconstituting itself thus the somewhat arbitrary guardian of burgess\r\nmorality[1359]. M. Petit de Julleville analyses a curious _jeu_ filled\r\nwith chaff against an unfortunate M. Du Tillet who underwent the\r\npenalty at Dijon in 1579 for the crime of beating his wife in the month\r\nof May[1360]. At Lyon, too, _chevauchées_ of a similar type seem to\r\nhave been much in vogue[1361].\r\n\r\nIn the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the entertainment of\r\nthe _sociétés joyeuses_ was largely dramatic. We find them, as\r\nindeed we find the participants in the strictly clerical feasts of\r\nFools[1362] and of Boys[1363], during the same period, occupied\r\nwith the performance both of miracles and of the various forms of\r\ncontemporary comedy known as farces, moralities, _sotties_ and _sermons\r\njoyeux_[1364]. Of their share in the miracles the next volume may\r\nspeak[1365]: their relations to the development of comedy require a\r\nword or two here. That normal fifteenth-century comedy, that of the\r\nfarce and the morality, in any way had its origin in the Feast of\r\nFools, whether clerical or lay, can hardly be admitted. It almost\r\ncertainly arose out of the minstrel tradition, and when already a\r\nfull-blown art was adapted by the _fous_, as by other groups of amateur\r\nperformers, from minstrelsy. With the special forms of the _sottie_ and\r\nthe _sermon joyeux_ it is otherwise. These may reasonably be regarded\r\nas the definite contribution of the Feast of Fools to the types of\r\ncomedy. The very name of the _sermon joyeux_, indeed, sufficiently\r\ndeclares its derivation. It is parody of a class, the humour of which\r\nwould particularly appeal to revelling clerks: it finds its place in\r\nthe general burlesque of divine worship, which is the special note\r\nof the feast[1366]. The character of the _sotties_, again, does not\r\nleave their origin doubtful; they are, on the face of them, farces in\r\nwhich the actors are _sots_ or _fous_. Historically, we know that some\r\nat least of the extant _sotties_ were played by _sociétés joyeuses_\r\nat Paris, Geneva and elsewhere; and the analysis of their contents\r\nlays bare the ruling idea as precisely that expressed in the motto\r\nof the _Infanterie Dijonnaise_--‘_Stultorum numerus est infinitus_.’\r\nIt is their humour and their mode of satire to represent the whole\r\nworld, from king to clown, as wearing the cap and bells, and obeying\r\nthe lordship of folly. French writers have aptly compared them to\r\nthe modern dramatic type known as the _revue_[1367]. The germ of the\r\n_sottie_ is to be found as early as the thirteenth century in the work\r\nof that Adan de la Hale, whose anticipation of at least one other form\r\nof fifteenth-century drama has called for comment[1368]. Adan’s _Jeu\r\nde la Feuillée_ seems to have been played before the _puy_ of Arras,\r\nperhaps, as the name suggests, in the _tonnelle_ of a garden, on the\r\neve of the first of May, 1262. It is composed of various elements: the\r\nlater scenes are a _féerie_ in which the author draws upon Hellequin\r\nand his _mesnie_ and the three _fées_, Morgue, Maglore and Arsile, of\r\npeasant tradition. But there is an episode which is sheer _sottie_.\r\nThe relics of St. Acaire, warranted to cure folly, are tried upon the\r\ngood burgesses of Arras one by one; and there is a genuine fool or\r\n_dervés_, who, like his lineal descendant Touchstone, ‘uses his folly\r\nas a stalking-horse to shoot his wit’ in showers of arrowy satire upon\r\nmankind[1369]. Of the later and regular _sotties_, the most famous\r\nare those written by Pierre Gringoire for the _Enfants-sans-Souci_ of\r\nParis. In these, notably the _Jeu du Prince des Sotz_, and in others\r\nby less famous writers, the conception of the all-embracing reign of\r\nfolly finds constant and various expression[1370]. Outside France some\r\nreflection of the _sottie_ is to be found in the _Fastnachtspiele_\r\nor Shrovetide plays of Nuremberg and other German towns. These were\r\nperformed mainly, but not invariably, at Shrovetide, by students or\r\nartisans, not necessarily organized into regular guilds. They are\r\ndramatically of the crudest, being little more than processions of\r\nfigures, each of whom in turn sings his couplets. But in several\r\nexamples these figures are a string of _Narren_, and the matter of\r\nthe verses is in the satirical vein of the _sotties_[1371]. The\r\n_Fastnachtspiele_ are probably to be traced, not so much to the Feast\r\nof Fools proper, as to the spring sword-dances in which, as we have\r\nseen, a _Narr_ or ‘fool’ is _de rigueur_. They share, however, with the\r\n_sotties_ their fundamental idea of the universal domination of folly.\r\n\r\nThe extension of this idea may indeed be traced somewhat widely in the\r\nsatirical and didactic literature of the later Middle Ages and the\r\nRenascence. I cannot go at length into this question here, but must\r\ncontent myself with referring to Professor Herford’s valuable account\r\nof the cycle, which includes the _Speculum Stultorum_ of Wireker,\r\nLydgate’s _Order of Fools_, Sebastian Brandt’s _Narrenschiff_ and its\r\ninnumerable imitations, the _Encomium Moriae_ of Erasmus, and Robert\r\nArmin the player’s _Nest of Ninnies_[1372].\r\n\r\nWireker was an Englishman, and the ‘Order’ founded in the _Speculum_ by\r\nBrunellus, the Ass, was clearly suggested by the _sociétés joyeuses_.\r\nTraces of such _sociétés_ in England are, however, rare. Some of the\r\ntitles of local lords of misrule, such as the Abbot of Marrall at\r\nShrewsbury or the Abbot of Bon-Accord at Aberdeen, so closely resemble\r\nthe French nomenclature as to suggest their existence; but the only\r\ncertain example I have come across is in a very curious record from\r\nExeter. The register of Bishop Grandisson contains under the date July\r\n11, 1348, a mandate to the archdeacon and dean of Exeter and the rector\r\nof St. Paul’s, requiring them to prohibit the proceedings of a certain\r\n‘sect of malign men’ who call themselves the ‘Order of Brothelyngham.’\r\nThese men, says the bishop, wear a monkish habit, choose a lunatic\r\nfellow as abbot, set him up in the theatre, blow horns, and for day\r\nafter day beset in a great company the streets and places of the city,\r\ncapturing laity and clergy, and exacting ransom from them ‘in lieu of\r\na sacrifice.’ This they call a _ludus_, but it is sheer rapine[1373].\r\nGrandisson’s learned editor thinks that this _secta_ was a sect of\r\nmediaeval dissenters, but the description clearly points to a _société\r\njoyeuse_. And the recognition of the _droits_ exacted as being _loco\r\nsacrificii_ is to a folk-lorist most interesting.\r\n\r\nMore than one of the records which I have had occasion to quote make\r\nmention of an _habit des fous_ as of a recognized and familiar type\r\nof dress. These records are not of the earliest. The celebrants of\r\nthe ecclesiastical Feast of Fools wore _larvae_ or masks. Laity\r\nand clergy exchanged costumes: and the wearing of women’s garments\r\nby men probably represents one of the most primitive elements in\r\nthe custom. But there can be little doubt as to the nature of the\r\ntraditional ‘habit des fous’ from the fourteenth century onwards. Its\r\nmost characteristic feature was that hood garnished with ears, the\r\ndistribution of which to persons of importance gave such offence at\r\nTournai in 1499. A similar hood, fitting closely over the head and\r\ncut in scollops upon the shoulders, reappears in the _bâton_, dated\r\n1482, of the fools in the ducal chapel of Dijon. Besides two large\r\nasses’ ears, it also bears a central peak or crest[1374]. The eared\r\nhood became the regular badge of the _sociétés joyeuses_. It is found\r\non most of the seals and other devices of the _Infanterie Dijonnaise_,\r\nvariously modified, and often with bells hung upon the ears and the\r\npoints of the scollops[1375]. It was used at Amiens[1376], and at\r\nRouen and Evreux probably gave a name to the _Cornards_[1377]. Marot\r\ndescribes it as appropriate to a _sot de la Basoche_ at Paris[1378].\r\nIt belongs also to the _Narren_ of Nuremberg[1379], and is to be\r\nseen in innumerable figured representations of fools in miniatures,\r\nwoodcuts, carvings, the Amiens _monetae_, and so forth, during the\r\nlater Middle Ages and the Renascence[1380]. Such a close-fitting hood\r\nwas of course common wear in the fourteenth century. It is said to\r\nbe of Gaulish origin, and to be retained in the religious cowl. The\r\n_differentiae_ of the hood of a ‘fool’ from another must be sought in\r\nthe grotesque appendages of ears, crest and bells[1381]. Already an\r\neared hood, exactly like that of the ‘fools,’ distinguishes a mask,\r\nperhaps Gaulish, of the Roman period[1382]. It may therefore have been\r\nadopted in the _Kalendae_ at an early date. But it is not, I think,\r\nunfair to assume that it was originally a sophistication of a more\r\nprimitive headdress, namely the actual head of a sacrificial animal\r\nworn by the worshipper at the New Year festival. That the ears are\r\nasses’ ears explains itself in view of the prominence of that animal\r\nat the Feast of Fools. It must be added that the central crest is\r\ndeveloped in some of the examples figured by Douce into the head and\r\nneck, in others into the comb only, of a cock[1383]. With the hood, in\r\nmost of the examples quoted above, goes the _marotte_. This is a kind\r\nof doll carried by the ‘fool,’ and presents a replica of his own head\r\nand shoulders with their hood upon the end of a short staff. In some of\r\nDouce’s figures the _marotte_ is replaced or supplemented by some other\r\nform of bauble, such as a bladder on a stick, stuffed into various\r\nshapes, or hollow and containing peas[1384]. Naturally the colours of\r\nthe ‘fools’ were gay and strikingly contrasted. Those of the Paris\r\n_Enfants-sans-Souci_ were yellow and green[1385]. But it may be doubted\r\nwhether these colours were invariable, or whether there is much in the\r\nsymbolical significance attributed to them by certain writers[1386].\r\nThe _Infanterie Dijonnaise_ in fact added red to their yellow and\r\ngreen[1387]. The colours of the Clèves Order of Fools were red and\r\nyellow[1388].\r\n\r\nIt will not have escaped notice that the costume just described, the\r\nparti-coloured garments, the hood with its ears, bells and coxcomb,\r\nand the _marotte_, is precisely that assigned by the custom of the\r\nstage to the fools who appear as _dramatis personae_ in several of\r\nShakespeare’s plays[1389]. Yet these fools have nothing to do with\r\n_sociétés joyeuses_ or the Feast of Fools; they represent the ‘set,’\r\n‘allowed,’ or ‘all-licensed’ fool[1390], the domestic jester of royal\r\ncourts and noble houses. The great have always found pleasure in that\r\nnear neighbourhood of folly which meaner men vainly attempt to shun.\r\nRome shared the _stultus_ with her eastern subjects and her barbarian\r\ninvaders alike; and the ‘natural,’ genuine or assumed, was, like his\r\nfellow the dwarf, an institution in every mediaeval and Renascence\r\npalace[1391]. The question arises how far the _habit_ of the _sociétés\r\njoyeuses_ was also that of the domestic fool. In France there is\r\nsome evidence that from the end of the fourteenth century it was\r\noccasionally at least taken as such. The tomb in Saint Maurice’s at\r\nSenlis of Thévenin de St. Leger, fool to Charles V, who died in 1374,\r\nrepresents him in a crested hood with a _marotte_[1392]. Rabelais\r\ndescribes the fool Seigni Joan, apparently intended for a court\r\nfool, as having a _marotte_ and ears to his hood. On the other hand,\r\nhe makes Panurge present Triboulet, the fool of Louis XII, with a\r\nsword of gilt wood and a bladder[1393]. A little later Jean Passerat\r\nspeaks of the hood, green and yellow, with bells, of another royal\r\nfool[1394]. In the seventeenth century the green and yellow and an\r\neared hood formed part of the fool’s dress which the duke of Nevers\r\nimposed upon a peccant treasurer[1395]. But in France the influence of\r\nthe _sociétés joyeuses_ was directly present. I do not find that the\r\ndata quoted by Douce quite bear out his transference of the regular\r\nFrench _habit de fou_ to England. Hoods were certainly required as part\r\nof the costume for ‘fools,’ ‘disards,’ or ‘vices’ in the court revels\r\nof 1551-2, together with ‘longe’ coats of various gay colours[1396];\r\nbut these were for masks, and on ordinary occasions the fools of the\r\nking and the nobles seem to have worn the usual dress of a courtier\r\nor servant[1397]. Like Triboulet, they often bore, as part of this, a\r\ngilded wooden sword[1398]. A coxcomb, however, seems to have been a\r\nrecognized fool ensign[1399], and once, in a tale, the complete _habit_\r\nis described[1400]. Other fool costumes include a long petticoat[1401],\r\nthe more primitive calf-skin[1402], and a fox tail hanging from the\r\nback[1403]. The two latter seem to bring us back to the sacrificial\r\n_exuviae_, and form a link between the court fool and the grotesque\r\n‘fool,’ or ‘Captain Cauf Tail’ of the morris dances and other village\r\nrevels.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the case with the domestic fool of history, it\r\nis not improbable that the tradition of the stage rightly interprets\r\nthe intention of Shakespeare. The actual texts are not very decisive.\r\nThe point that is most clear is that the fool wears a ‘motley’ or\r\n‘patched’ coat[1404]. The fool in _Lear_ has a ‘coxcomb[1405]’;\r\nMonsieur Lavache in _All’s Well_ a ‘bauble,’ not of course necessarily\r\na _marotte_[1406]; Touchstone, in _As You Like It_, is a courtier and\r\nhas a sword[1407]. The sword may perhaps be inherited from the ‘vice’\r\nof the later moralities[1408]; and, in other respects, it is possible\r\nthat Shakespeare took his conception of the fool less from contemporary\r\ncustom, for indeed we hear of no fool at Elizabeth’s court, than from\r\nthe abundant fool-literature, continental and English, above described.\r\nThe earliest of his fools, Feste in _Twelfth Night_, quotes Rabelais,\r\nin whose work, as we have just seen, the fool Triboulet figures[1409].\r\nIt is noticeable that the appearance of fools as important _dramatis\r\npersonae_ in the plays apparently coincides with the substitution\r\nfor William Kempe as ‘comic lead’ in the Lord Chamberlain’s company\r\nof Robert Armin[1410], whose own _Nest of Ninnies_ abounds in\r\nreminiscences of the fool-literature[1411]. But whatever outward\r\nappearance Shakespeare intended his fools to bear, there can be no\r\ndoubt that in their dramatic use as vehicles of general social satire\r\nthey very closely recall the manner of the _sotties_. Touchstone is\r\nthe type: ‘He uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and under the\r\npresentation of that he shoots his wit[1412].’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n                           MASKS AND MISRULE\r\n\r\n    [_Bibliographical Note._--On the history of the English Masque\r\n    A.

Brotanek’s\r\n    very full _Die englischen Maskenspiele_ (1902) only reached me\r\n    when this chapter was in type.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAlready in Saxon England Christmas was becoming a season of secular\r\nmerry-making as well as of religious devotion[1413]. Under the\r\npost-Conquest kings this tendency was stimulated by the fixed habit\r\nof the court. William the Bastard, like Charlemagne before him, chose\r\nthe solemn day for his coronation; and from his reign Christmas\r\ntakes rank, with Easter, Whitsuntide, and, at a much later date, St.\r\nGeorge’s day, as one of the great courtly festivals of the year. The\r\n_Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ is at the pains to record the place of its\r\ncelebration, twelvemonth after twelvemonth[1414]. Among the many\r\nforgotten Christmassings of mediaeval kings, history lays a finger on\r\na few of special note: that at which Richard II, with characteristic\r\nextravagance and the consumption of ‘200 tunns of wine and 2,000 oxen\r\nwith their appurtenances,’ entertained the papal legate in 1398;\r\nand that, more truly royal, at which Henry V, besieging Rouen in\r\n1418, ‘refreshed all the poore people with vittels to their great\r\ncomfort and his high praise[1415].’ The Tudors were not behindhand\r\nwith any opportunity for pageantry and display, nor does the vogue of\r\nChristmas throughout the length and breadth of ‘merrie England’ need\r\ndemonstration[1416]. The Puritans girded at it, as they did at May\r\ngames, and the rest of the delightful circumstance of life, until in\r\n1644 an ordinance of the Long Parliament required the festival to give\r\nplace to a monthly fast with the day fixed for which it happened to\r\ncoincide[1417].\r\n\r\nThe entertainment of a mediaeval Christmas was diverse. There was\r\nthe banquet. The Boy Bishop came to court. Carols were sung. New\r\nYear gifts were exchanged. _Hastiludia_--jousts or tournaments--were\r\npopular and splendid. Minstrels and jugglers made music and mirth.\r\nA succession of gaieties filled the Twelve nights from the Nativity\r\nto the Epiphany, or even the wider space from St. Thomas’s day to\r\nCandlemas. It is, however, in the custom of masquing that I find the\r\nmost direct legacy to Christmas of the Kalends celebrations in their\r\n_bourgeois_ forms. _Larvae_ or masks are prominent in the records\r\nand prohibitions of the Feast of Fools from the decretal of Innocent\r\nIII in 1207 to the letter of the Paris theologians in 1445[1418].\r\nI take them as being, like the characteristic hood of the ‘fool,’\r\nsophistications of the _capita pecudum_, the sacrificial _exuviae_\r\nworn by the rout of worshippers at the _Kalendae_. Precisely such\r\n_larvae_, under another name, confront us in the detailed records of\r\ntwo fourteenth-century Christmasses. Amongst the documents of the Royal\r\nWardrobe for the reign of Edward III are lists of stuffs issued for\r\nthe _ludi domini regis_ in 1347-8 and 1348-9[1419]. For the Christmas\r\nof 1347, held at Guildford, were required a number of ‘viseres’ in\r\nthe likeness of men, women, and angels, curiously designed ‘crestes,’\r\nand other costumes representing dragons, peacocks, and swans[1420].\r\nThe Christmas of 1348 held at Ottford and the following Epiphany at\r\nMerton yield similar entries[1421]. What were these ‘viseres’ used for?\r\nThe term _ludi_ must not be pressed. It appears to be distinct from\r\n_hastiludia_, which comes frequently in the same documents, although\r\nin the _hastiludia_ also ‘viseres’ were used[1422]. But it does not\r\nnecessarily imply anything dramatic, and the analogies suggest that\r\nit is a wide generic term, roughly equivalent to ‘disports,’ or to\r\nthe ‘revels’ of the Tudor vocabulary[1423]. It recurs in 1388 when\r\nthe Wardrobe provided linen coifs for twenty-one counterfeit men of\r\nthe law in the _ludus regis_[1424]. The sets of costumes supplied for\r\nall these _ludi_ would most naturally be used by groups of performers\r\nin something of the nature of a dance; and they point to some\r\nprimitive form of masque, such as Froissart describes in contemporary\r\nFrance[1425], the precursor of the long line of development which,\r\ntraceable from the end of the following century, culminates in the\r\nglories of Ben Jonson. The vernacular name for such a _ludus_ in\r\nthe fourteenth century was ‘mumming’ or ‘disguising[1426].’ Orders\r\nof the city of London in 1334, 1393, and 1405 forbid a practice of\r\ngoing about the streets at Christmas _ove visere ne faux visage_, and\r\nentering the houses of citizens to play at dice therein[1427]. In 1417\r\n‘mummyng’ is specifically included in a similar prohibition[1428];\r\nand in a proclamation of the following year, ‘mommyng’ is classed\r\nwith ‘playes’ and ‘enterludes’ as a variety of ‘disgisyng[1429].’\r\nBut the disport which they denied to less dignified folk the rulers\r\nof the city retained for themselves as the traditional way of paying\r\na visit of compliment to a great personage. A fragmentary chronicle\r\namongst Stowe’s manuscripts describes such a visit paid to Richard II\r\nat the Candlemas preceding his accession in 1377. The ‘mummers’ were\r\ndisguised with ‘vizards’ to represent an emperor and a pope with their\r\n_cortèges_. They rode to Kennington, entered the hall on foot, invited\r\nthe prince and the lords to dice and discreetly lost, drank and danced\r\nwith the company, and so departed[1430]. This is the first of several\r\nsuch mummings upon record. Some chroniclers relate that it was at a\r\nmumming that the partisans of Richard II attempted to seize Henry IV on\r\nTwelfth night in 1400[1431]. In the following year, when the Emperor\r\nManuel of Constantinople spent Christmas with Henry at Eltham, the ‘men\r\nof London maden a gret mommyng to hym of xij aldermen and there sons,\r\nfor whiche they hadde gret thanke[1432].’ In 1414 Sir John Oldcastle\r\nand his Lollards were in their turn accused of using a mumming as a\r\ncloak of sedition[1433]. Thus the London distrust of false visages had\r\nits justification, and it is noteworthy that so late as 1511 an Act of\r\nParliament forbade the visits of mummers disguised with visors to great\r\nhouses on account of the disorders so caused. Even the sale of visors\r\nwas made illegal[1434].\r\n\r\nSo far there is nothing to point to the use of any dialogue or speeches\r\nat mummings. The only detailed account is that of 1377, and the\r\npassage which describes how the mummers ‘saluted’ the lords, ‘shewing\r\na pair of dice upon a table to play with the prince,’ reads rather\r\nas if the whole performance were in dumb show. This is confirmed\r\nby the explanation of the term ‘mummynge’ given in a contemporary\r\nglossary[1435]. The development of the mumming in a literary direction\r\nmay very likely have been due to the multifarious activity of John\r\nLydgate. Amongst his miscellaneous poems are preserved several which\r\nare stated by their collector Shirley to have been written for mummings\r\nor disguisings either before the king or before the lord mayor of\r\nLondon[1436]. They all seem to belong to the reign of Henry VI and\r\nprobably to the years 1427-30. And they show pretty clearly the way\r\nin which verses got into the disguisings. Two of them are ‘lettres’\r\nintroducing mummings presented by the guilds of the mercers and the\r\ngoldsmiths to lord mayor Eastfield[1437]. They were doubtless read\r\naloud in the hall. A _balade_ sent to Henry and the queen mother at\r\nEltham is of the same type[1438]. Two ‘devyses’ for mummings at London\r\nand Windsor were probably recited by a ‘presenter.’ The Windsor one\r\nis of the nature of a prologue, describing a ‘myracle’ which the king\r\nis ‘to see[1439].’ The London one was meant to accompany the course\r\nof the performance, and describes the various personages as they\r\nenter[1440]. Still more elaborate is a set of verses used at Hertford.\r\nThe first part of these is certainly spoken by a presenter who points\r\nout the ‘vpplandishe’ complainants to whom he refers. But the reply is\r\nin the first person, and apparently put in the mouths of the ‘wyues’\r\nthemselves, while the conclusion is a judgement delivered, again\r\nprobably by the presenter, in the name of the king[1441].\r\n\r\nWhether Lydgate was the author of an innovation or not, the\r\nintroduction of speeches, songs, and dialogues was common enough in\r\nthe fully-developed mummings. For these we must look to the sumptuous\r\ncourts of the early Tudors. Lydgate died about 1451, and the Wars of\r\nthe Roses did not encourage revelry. The _Paston Letters_ tell how\r\nthe Lady Morley forbade ‘dysguysyngs’ in her house at Christmas after\r\nher husband’s death in 1476[1442]. There were _ludi_ in Scotland\r\nunder James III[1443]. But those of his successor, James IV, although\r\nnumerous and varied[1444], probably paled before the elaborate ‘plays’\r\nand ‘disguisings’ which the contemporary account-books of Henry VII\r\nreveal[1445]. Of only one ‘disguising,’ however, of this period is a\r\nfull account preserved. It took place in Westminster Hall after the\r\nwedding of Prince Arthur with Katharine of Spain on November 18, 1501,\r\nand was ‘convayed and showed in pageants proper and subtile.’ There was\r\na castle, bearing singing children and eight disguised ladies, amongst\r\nwhom was one ‘apparelled like unto the Princesse of Spaine,’ a Ship in\r\nwhich came Hope and Desire as Ambassadors, and a Mount of Love, from\r\nwhich issued eight knights, and assaulted the castle. This allegorical\r\ncompliment, which was set forth by ‘countenance, speeches, and\r\ndemeanor,’ ended, the knights and ladies danced together and presently\r\n‘avoided.’ Thereupon the royal party themselves fell to dancing[1446].\r\n‘Pageants’ are mentioned in connexion with other disguisings of the\r\nreign, and on one occasion the disguising was ‘for a moryce[1447].’\r\nFurther light is thrown upon the nature of a disguising by the\r\nregulations contained in a contemporary book of ‘Orders concerning an\r\nEarl’s House.’ A disguising is to be introduced by torch-bearers and\r\naccompanied by minstrels. If there are women disguised, they are to\r\ndance first, and then the men. Then is to come the morris, ‘if any be\r\nordeynid.’ Finally men and women are to dance together and depart in\r\nthe ‘towre, or thing devised for theim.’ The whole performance is to be\r\nunder the control of a ‘maister of the disguisinges’ or ‘revills[1448].’\r\n\r\nIt is possible to distinguish a simpler and a more elaborate type\r\nof masked entertainment, side by side, throughout the splendid\r\nfestivities of the court of Henry VIII. For the more or less impromptu\r\n‘mumming,’ the light-hearted and riotous king had a great liking. In\r\nthe first year of his reign we find him invading the queen’s chamber\r\nat Westminster ‘for a gladness to the queen’s grace’ in the guise of\r\nRobin Hood, with his men ‘in green coats and hose of Kentish Kendal’\r\nand a Maid Marian[1449]. The queen subsequently got left out, but there\r\nwere many similar disports throughout the reign. One of these, in which\r\nthe king and a party disguised as shepherds broke in upon a banquet of\r\nWolsey’s, has been immortalized by Shakespeare[1450]. Such mummings\r\nwere comparatively simple, and the Wardrobe was as a rule only called\r\nupon to provide costumes and masks, although on one occasion a lady\r\nin a ‘tryke’ or ‘spell’ wagon was drawn in[1451]. But the more formal\r\n‘disguisings’ of the previous reign were also continued and set forth\r\nwith great splendour. In 1527 a ‘House of Revel’ called the ‘Long\r\nHouse’ was built for their performance and decorated by Holbein[1452],\r\nand there was constant expenditure on the provision of pageants. ‘The\r\nGolldyn Arber in the Arche-yerd of Plesyer,’ ‘the Dangerus Fortrees,’\r\n‘the Ryche Mount,’ ‘the Pavyllon un the Plas Parlos,’ ‘the Gardyn\r\nde Esperans,’ ‘the Schatew Vert’[1453] are some of the names given\r\nto them, and these well suggest the kind of allegorical spectacular\r\nentertainment, diversified with dance and song, which the chroniclers\r\ndescribe.\r\n\r\nThe ‘mumming’ or ‘disguising,’ then, as it took shape at the beginning\r\nof the sixteenth century, was a form of court revel, in which, behind\r\nthe accretions of literature and pageantry, can be clearly discerned a\r\nnucleus of folk-custom in the entry of the band of worshippers, with\r\ntheir sacrificial _exuviae_, to bring the house good luck. The mummers\r\nare masked and disguised folk who come into the hall uninvited and call\r\nupon the company gathered there to dice and dance. It is not necessary\r\nto lay stress upon the distinction between the two terms, which are\r\nused with some indifference. When they first make their appearance\r\ntogether in the London proclamation of 1418 the masked visit is a\r\n‘mumming,’ and is included with the ‘enterlude’ under the generic term\r\nof ‘disguising.’ In the Henry VII documents ‘mumming’ does not occur,\r\nand in those of Henry VIII ‘mumming’ and ‘disguising’ are practically\r\nidentical, ‘disguising,’ if anything, being used of the more elaborate\r\nshows, while both are properly distinct from ‘interlude.’ But I do\r\nnot think that ‘disguising’ ever quite lost its earlier and widest\r\nsense[1454]. It must now be added that early in Henry VIII’s reign a\r\nnew term was introduced which ultimately supplanted both the others.\r\nThe chronicler Hall relates how in 1513 ‘On the daie of the Epiphanie\r\nat night, the kyng with a xi other were disguised, after the maner of\r\nItalie, called a maske, a thyng not seen afore in Englande, thei were\r\nappareled in garmentes long and brode, wrought all with gold, with\r\nvisers and cappes of gold & after the banket doen, these Maskers came\r\nin, with sixe gentlemen disguised in silke bearyng staffe torches, and\r\ndesired the ladies to daunce, some were content, and some that knewe\r\nthe fashion of it refused, because it was not a thyng commonly seen.\r\nAnd after thei daunced and commoned together, as the fashion of the\r\nMaske is, thei tooke their leaue and departed, and so did the Quene,\r\nand all the ladies[1455].’\r\n\r\nThe good Hall is not particularly lucid in his descriptions, and\r\nhistorians of the mask have doubted what, beyond the name, was the\r\nexact modification introduced ‘after the maner of Italie’ in 1512.\r\nA recent writer on the subject, Dr. H. A. Evans, thinks that it lay\r\nin the fact that the maskers danced with the spectators, as well\r\nas amongst themselves[1456]. But the mummers of 1377 already did\r\nthis, although of course the custom may have grown obsolete before\r\n1513. I am rather inclined to regard it as a matter of costume. The\r\noriginal Revels Account for this year--and Hall’s reports of court\r\nrevels are so full that he must surely have had access to some such\r\nsource--mentions provision for ‘12 nobyll personages, inparylled with\r\nblew damaske and yelow damaske long gowns and hoods with hats after\r\nthe maner of maskelyng in Etaly[1457].’ Does not this description\r\nsuggest that the ‘thing not sene afore in England’ was of the nature\r\nof a domino? In any case from 1513 onwards ‘masks,’ ‘maskelers’ or\r\n‘maskelings’ recur frequently in the notices of the revels[1458]. The\r\nearly masks resembled the simpler type of ‘mumming’ rather than the\r\nmore elaborate and spectacular ‘disguising,’ but by the end of the\r\nreign both of the older terms had become obsolete, and all Elizabethan\r\ncourt performances in which the visor and the dance played the leading\r\nparts were indifferently known as masks[1459]. Outside the court,\r\nindeed, the nomenclature was more conservative, and to this day the\r\nvillage performers who claim the right to enter your house at Christmas\r\ncall themselves ‘mummers,’ ‘guisers’ or ‘geese-dancers.’ Sometimes\r\nthey merely dance, sing and feast with you, but in most places, as a\r\nformer chapter has shown, they have adopted from another season of the\r\nyear its characteristic rite, which in course of time has grown from\r\nfolk-dance into folk-drama[1460].\r\n\r\nI now pass from the mask to another point of contact between the Feast\r\nof Fools and the Tudor revels. This was the _dominus festi_. A special\r\nofficer, told off to superintend the revels, pastimes and disports of\r\nthe Christmas season, is found both in the English and the Scottish\r\ncourt at the end of the fifteenth century. In Scotland he bore the\r\ntitle of Abbot of Unreason[1461]; in England he was occasionally the\r\nAbbot, but more usually the Lord of Misrule. Away from court, other\r\nlocal designations present themselves: but Lord of Misrule or Christmas\r\nLord are the generic titles known to contemporary literature[1462].\r\nThe household accounts of Henry VII make mention of a Lord or Abbot of\r\nMisrule for nearly every Christmas in the reign[1463]. Under Henry VIII\r\na Lord was annually appointed, with one exception, until 1520[1464].\r\nFrom that date, the records are not available, but an isolated notice\r\nin 1534 gives proof of the continuance of the custom[1465]. In 1521 a\r\nLord of Misrule held sway in the separate household of the Princess\r\nMary[1466], and there is extant a letter from the Princess’s council\r\nto Wolsey asking whether it were the royal pleasure that a similar\r\nappointment should be made in 1525[1467]. Little information can be\r\ngleaned as to the functions of the Lord of Misrule during the first two\r\nTudor reigns. It is clear that he was quite distinct from the officer\r\nknown as the ‘Master of the Revels,’ in whose hands lay the preparation\r\nand oversight of disguisings or masks and similar entertainments. The\r\nMaster of the Revels also makes his first appearance under Henry VII.\r\nOriginally he seems to have been appointed only _pro hac vice_, from\r\namong the officials, such as the comptroller of the household, already\r\nin attendance at court[1468]. This practice lasted well into the reign\r\nof Henry VIII, who was served in this capacity by such distinguished\r\ncourtiers, amongst others, as Sir Henry Guildford and Sir Anthony\r\nBrowne[1469]. Under them the preparation of the revels and the custody\r\nof the properties were in the hands of a permanent minor official. At\r\nfirst such work was done in the royal Wardrobe, but under Henry VIII it\r\nfell to a distinct ‘serjeant’ who was sometimes, but not always, also\r\n‘serjeant’ to the king’s tents. In 1545, however, a permanent Master of\r\nthe Revels was appointed in the person of Sir Thomas Cawarden, one of\r\nthe gentlemen of the privy chamber[1470]. Cawarden formed the Revels\r\ninto a regular office with a clerk comptroller, yeoman, and clerk,\r\nand a head quarters, at first in Warwick Inn, and afterwards in the\r\nprecinct of the dissolved Blackfriars, of which he obtained a grant\r\nfrom the king. This organization of the Revels endured in substance\r\nuntil after the Restoration[1471]. Not unnaturally there were some\r\njealousies and conflicts of authority between the permanent Master of\r\nthe Revels and the annual Lord of Misrule, and this comes out amusingly\r\nenough from some of Cawarden’s correspondence for 1551-3, preserved\r\nin the muniment room at Loseley. For the two Christmases during this\r\nperiod the Lordship of Misrule was held by George Ferrers, one of the\r\nauthors of the _Mirrour for Magistrates_[1472]; and Cawarden seems to\r\nhave put every possible difficulty in the way of the discharge of his\r\nduties. Ferrers appealed to the lords of the council, and it took half\r\na dozen official letters, signed by the great master of the household,\r\nMr. Secretary Cecil, and a number of other dignitaries, to induce the\r\nMaster of the Revels to provide the hobby horses and fool’s coat and\r\nwhat not, that were required[1473]. Incidentally this correspondence\r\nand the account books kept by Cawarden give some notion of the sort of\r\namusement which the Lord of Misrule was expected to organize. In 1551\r\nhe made his entry into court ‘out of the mone.’ He had his fool ‘John\r\nSmith’ in a ‘vice’s coote’ and a ‘dissard’s hoode,’ a part apparently\r\nplayed by the famous court fool, Will Somers. He had a ‘brigandyne’; he\r\nhad his ‘holds, prisons, and places of execuc’on, his cannypie, throne,\r\nseate, pillory, gibbet, hedding block, stocks, little ease, and other\r\nnecessary incydents to his person’; he had his ‘armury’ and his stables\r\nwith ‘13 hobby horses, whereof one with 3 heads for his person, bought\r\nof the carver for his justs and challenge at Greenwich.’ The masks this\r\nyear were of apes and bagpipes, of cats, of Greek worthies, and of\r\n‘medyoxes’ (‘double visaged, th’ one syde lyke a man, th’ other lyke\r\ndeath’)[1474]. The chief difficulty with Cawarden arose out of a visit\r\nto be paid by the Lord to London on January 4. The apparel provided\r\nfor his ‘viij counsellors’ on that occasion was so ‘insufficient’ that\r\nhe returned it, and told Cawarden that he had ‘mistaken y^e persons\r\nthat sholde weere them, as S^r Rob^t Stafford and Thom^s Wyndesor,\r\nw^h other gentlemen that stande also upon their reputac̃on, and wold\r\nnot be seen in London, so torche-berer lyke disgysed, for as moche\r\nas they are worthe or hope to be worthe[1475].’ After all it took a\r\nletter from the council to get the fresh apparel ready in time. It was\r\nready, for Machyn’s _Diary_ records the advent of the Lord and his\r\n‘consell’ to Tower Wharf, with a ‘mores danse,’ and the ‘proclamasyon’\r\nmade of him at the Cross in Cheap, and his visit to the mayor and the\r\nlord treasurer, ‘and so to Bysshopgate, and so to Towre warff, and\r\ntoke barge to Grenwyche[1476].’ Before the following Christmas of 1552\r\nFerrers was careful to send note of his schemes to Cawarden in good\r\ntime[1477]. This year he would come in in ‘blewe’ out of ‘_vastum\r\nvacuum_, the great waste.’ The ‘serpente with sevin heddes called\r\nhidra’ was to be his arms, his crest a ‘wholme bush’ and his ‘worde’\r\n_semper ferians_. Mr. Windham was to be his admiral, Sir George Howard\r\nhis master of the horse, and he required six councillors, ‘a divine,\r\na philosopher, an astronomer, a poet, a phisician, a potecarie, a m^r\r\nof requests, a sivilian, a disard, John Smyth, two gentleman ushers,\r\nbesides jugglers, tomblers, fooles, friers, and suche other.’ Again\r\nthere was a challenge with hobby horses, and again the Lord of Misrule\r\nvisited London on January 6, and was met by Sergeant Vauce, Lord of\r\nMisrule to ‘master Maynard the Shreyff’ whom he knighted. He then\r\nproceeded to dinner with the Lord Mayor[1478]. As he rode his cofferer\r\ncast gold and silver abroad, and Cawarden’s accounts show that ‘coynes’\r\nwere made for him by a ‘wyer-drawer,’ after the familiar fashion of the\r\nBoy Bishops in France[1479]. These accounts also give elaborate details\r\nof his dress and that of his retinue, and of a ‘Triumph of Venus and\r\nMars[1480].’ In the following year Edward was dead, and neither Mary\r\nnor Elizabeth seems to have revived the appointment of a Lord of\r\nMisrule at court[1481].\r\n\r\nBut the reign of the Lord of Misrule extended far beyond the verge\r\nof the royal palace. He was especially in vogue at those homes of\r\nlearning, the Universities and the Inns of Court, where Christmas,\r\nthough a season of feasting and _ludi_, had not yet become an occasion\r\nfor general ‘going down.’ Anthony à Wood records him in several Oxford\r\ncolleges, especially in Merton and St. John’s, and ascribes his\r\ndownfall, justly, no doubt, in part, to the Puritans[1482]. At Merton\r\nhe bore the title of _Rex fabarum_ or _Rex regni fabarum_[1483]. He\r\nwas a fellow of the college, was elected on November 19, and held\r\noffice until Candlemas, when the winter festivities closed with the\r\n_Ignis Regentium_ in the hall. The names of various _Reges fabarum_\r\nbetween 1487 and 1557 are preserved in the college registers, and\r\nthe last holder of the office elected in the latter year was Joseph\r\nHeywood, the uncle of John Donne, in his day a famous recusant[1484].\r\nAt St. John’s College a ‘Christmas Lord, or Prince of the Revells,’\r\nwas chosen up to 1577. Thirty years later, in 1607, the practice was\r\nfor one year revived, and a detailed account of this experiment was\r\ncommitted to manuscript by one Griffin Higgs[1485]. The Prince, who\r\nwas chosen on All Saints’ day, was Thomas Tucker. He was installed on\r\nNovember 5, and immediately made a levy upon past and present members\r\nof the college to meet the necessary expenses. Amongst the subscribers\r\nwas ‘Mr. Laude.’ On St. Andrew’s day, the Prince was publicly installed\r\nwith a dramatic ‘deuise’ or ‘showe’ called _Ara Fortunae_. The hall\r\nwas a great deal too full, a canopy fell down, and the ‘fool’ broke\r\nhis staff. On St. Thomas’s day, proclamation was made of the style and\r\ntitle of the Prince and of the officers who formed his household[1486].\r\nHe also ratified the ‘Decrees and Statutes’ promulgated in 1577 by his\r\npredecessor and added some rather pretty satire on the behaviour of\r\nspectators at college and other revels. On Christmas day the Prince\r\nwas attended to prayers, and took the vice-president’s chair in hall,\r\nwhere a boar’s head was brought in, and a carol sung. After supper\r\nwas an interlude, called _Saturnalia_. On St. John’s day ‘some of the\r\nPrince’s honest neighbours of St. Giles’s presented him with a maske\r\nor morris’; and the ‘twelve daies’ were brought in with appropriate\r\nspeeches. On December 29 was a Latin tragedy of _Philomela_, and\r\nthe Prince, who played Tereus, accidentally fell. On New Year’s day\r\nwere the Prince’s triumphs, introduced by a ‘shew’ called _Time’s\r\nComplaint_; and the honest chronicler records that this performance\r\n‘in the sight of the whole University’ was ‘a messe of absurdityes,’\r\nand that ‘two or three cold plaudites’ much discouraged the revellers.\r\nHowever, they went on with their undertaking. On January 10 were two\r\nshews, one called _Somnium Fundatoris_, and the other _The Seven\r\nDays of the Weeke_. The dearth in the city caused by a six weeks’\r\nfrost made the President inclined to stop the revels, as in a time of\r\n‘generall wo and calamity’; but happily a thaw came, and on January\r\n15 the college retrieved its reputation by a most successful public\r\nperformance of a comedy _Philomathes_. _The Seven Days of the Weeke_,\r\ntoo, though acted in private, had been so good that the vice-chancellor\r\nwas invited to see a repetition of it, and thus Sunday, January 17,\r\nwas ‘spent in great mirth.’ On the Thursday following there was a\r\nlittle _contretemps_. The canons of Christ Church invited the Prince\r\nto a comedy called _Yuletide_, and in this ‘many things were either\r\nill ment by them, or ill taken by vs.’ The play in fact was full of\r\nsatire of ‘Christmas Lords,’ and it is not surprising that an apology\r\nfrom the dean, who was vice-chancellor that year, was required to\r\nsoothe the Prince’s offended feelings. Term had now begun, but the\r\nrevels were renewed about Candlemas. On that day was a _Vigilate_ or\r\nall-night sitting, with cards, dice, dancing, and a mask. At supper\r\na quarrel arose. A man stabbed his fellow, and the Prince’s stocks\r\nwere requisitioned in deadly earnest. After supper the Prince was\r\nentertained in the president’s lodging with ‘a wassall called the five\r\nbells of Magdalen church.’ On February 6, ‘beeing egge Satterday,’ some\r\ngentlemen scholars of the town brought a mask of _Penelope’s Wooers_\r\nto the Prince, which, however, fell through; and finally, on Shrove\r\nTuesday, after a shew called _Ira seu Tumulus Fortunae_, the Prince\r\nwas conducted to his private chamber in a mourning procession, and\r\nhis reign ended. Even yet the store of entertainment provided was not\r\nexhausted. On the following Saturday, though it was Lent, an English\r\ntragedy of _Periander_ was given, the press of spectators being so\r\ngreat that ‘4 or 500’ who could not get in caused a tumult. And still\r\nthere remained ‘many other thinges entended,’ but unperformed. There\r\nwas the mask of _Penelope’s Wooers_, with the _State of Telemachus_\r\nand a _Controversy of Irus and his Ragged Company_. There were an\r\n_Embassage from Lubberland_, a _Creation of White Knights of the Order\r\nof Aristotle’s Well_, a _Triumph of all the Founders of Colleges in\r\nOxford_, not to speak of a lottery ‘for matters of mirth and witt’ and\r\na court leet and baron to be held by the Prince. So much energy and\r\ninvention in one small college is astonishing, and it was hard that Mr.\r\nGriffin Higgs should have to complain of the treatment meted out to\r\nits entertainers by the University at large. ‘Wee found ourselves,’ he\r\nsays, ‘(wee will say justly) taxed for any the least errour (though\r\ningenious spirits would have pardoned many things, where all things\r\nwere entended for their owne pleasure) but most vnjustly censured, and\r\nenvied for that which was done (wee daresay) indifferently well.’\r\n\r\nAmongst other colleges in which the Lord of Misrule was regularly\r\nor occasionally chosen, Anthony à Wood names, with somewhat vague\r\nreferences, New College and Magdalen[1487]. To these may certainly\r\nbe added Trinity, where the _Princeps Natalicius_ is mentioned\r\nin an audit-book of 1559[1488]. But the most singular of all the\r\nOxford documents bearing on the subject cannot be identified with\r\nany particular college. It consists of a series of three Latin\r\nletters[1489]. The first is addressed by _Gloria in excelsis_ to all\r\nmortals _sub Natalicia ditione degentibus_. They are bidden keep\r\npeace during the festal season and wished pleasant headaches in the\r\nmornings. The vicegerent of _Gloria in excelsis_ upon earth is an\r\nannually constituted _praelatia_, that so a longer term of office\r\nmay not beget tyranny. The letter goes on to confirm the election\r\nto the kingly dignity of Robertus Grosteste[1490], and enjoins\r\nobedience to him _secundum Natalicias leges_. It is _datum in aere\r\nluminoso supra Bethlemeticam regionem ubi nostra magnificentia fuit\r\npastoribus promulgata_. The second letter is addressed to _R[obert]\r\nRegi Natalicio_ and his _proceres_ by _Discretio virtutum omnium parens\r\npariter ac regina_. It is a long discourse on the value of moderation,\r\nand concludes with a declaration that a moderate _laetitia_ shall\r\nrule until Candlemas, and then give way to a moderate _clerimonia_.\r\nThe third is more topical and less didactic in its tone. It parodies\r\na papal letter to a royal sovereign. _Transaetherius, pater patrum\r\nac totius ecclesiasticae monarchiae pontifex et minister_ complains,\r\n_R. Regi Natalicio_, of certain abuses of his rule. His _stolidus\r\nsenescallus_, _madidus marescallus_ and _parliamenti grandiloquus\r\nsed nugatorius prolocutor_ have _ut plura possent inferre stipendia_\r\nassaulted and imprisoned on the very night of the Nativity, _Iohannem\r\nCurtibiensem episcopum_. In defence of these proceedings the Rex has\r\npleaded _quasdam antiquas regni tui, non dico consuetudines, sed potius\r\ncorruptelas_. Transaetherius gives the peccant officials three hours in\r\nwhich to make submission. If they fail, they shall be excommunicated,\r\nand Iohannes de Norwico, the warden of Jericho, will have orders\r\nto debar them from that place and confine them to their rooms. The\r\nletter is _datum in vertice Montis Cancari, pontificatus nostri anni\r\nnon fluxibili sed aeterno_. I think it is clear that these letters\r\nare not a mere political skit, but refer to some actual Christmas\r\nrevels. The waylaying of _Iohannes Curtibiensis episcopus_ to make him\r\n‘pay his footing’ is exactly the sort of thing that happened at the\r\nFeast of Fools, and the _non consuetudines, sed potius corruptelas_\r\nis the very language of the decretal of 1207[1491]. But surely they\r\nare not twelfth-or early thirteenth-century revels, as they must be\r\nif ‘Robertus Grosteste’ is taken literally as the famous bishop of\r\nLincoln[1492]. There was no _parliamenti prolocutor_, for instance, in\r\nhis day. They are fourteenth-, fifteenth-, or even sixteenth-century\r\nfooling, in connexion with some _Rex Natalicius_ who adopted, to season\r\nhis jest, the name of the great mediaeval legislator against all such\r\n_ludi_.\r\n\r\nAt Cambridge an order of the Visitors of Edward VI in 1549 forbade\r\nthe appointment of a _dominus ludorum_ in any college[1493]. But the\r\nprohibition did not endure, and more than one unsuccessful Puritan\r\nendeavour to put down Lords of Misrule is recorded by Fuller[1494].\r\nLittle, however, is known of the Cambridge Lords; their bare existence\r\nat St. John’s[1495] and Christ’s Colleges[1496]; and at Trinity the\r\nfact that they were called _imperatores_, a name on the invention of\r\nwhich one of the original fellows of the college, the astronomer John\r\nDee, plumes himself[1497]. At schools such as Winchester and Eton, the\r\nfunctions of Lord of Misrule were naturally supplied by the Boy Bishop.\r\nAt Westminster there was a _paedonomus_, and Bryan Duppa held the\r\noffice early in the seventeenth century[1498].\r\n\r\nThe revels of the Inns of Court come into notice in 1422, when the\r\n_Black Book_ of Lincoln’s Inn opens with the announcement _Ceux\r\nsont les nouns de ceux qe fuerunt assignes de continuer yci le\r\nnowel_[1499]. They are mentioned in the _Paston Letters_ in 1451[1500],\r\nand in Sir Fortescue’s _De laudibus Legum Angliae_ about 1463[1501].\r\nSpace compels me to be very brief in summarizing the further records\r\nfor each Inn.\r\n\r\nLincoln’s Inn had in 1430 its four revels on All Hallows’ day, St.\r\nErkenwold’s (April 30), Candlemas and Midsummer day, under a ‘Master of\r\nthe Revels.’ In 1455 appears a ‘marshal,’ who was a Bencher charged to\r\nkeep order and prevent waste from the last week of Michaelmas to the\r\nfirst of Hilary term. Under him were the Master of the Revels, a butler\r\nand steward for Christmas, a constable-marshal, server, and cup-bearer.\r\nIn the sixteenth century the ‘grand Christmassings’ were additional\r\nto the four revels, and those of Candlemas were called the ‘post\r\nrevels.’ Christmas had its ‘king.’ In 1519 it was ordered that the\r\n‘king’ should sit on Christmas day, that on Innocents’ day the ‘King of\r\nCokneys’[1502] should ‘sytt and haue due seruice,’ and that the marshal\r\nshould himself sit as king on New Year’s day. In 1517 some doors had\r\nbeen broken by reason of ‘Jake Stray,’ apparently a popular anti-king\r\nor pretender, and the order concludes, ‘Item, that Jack Strawe and all\r\nhis adherentes be from hensforth uttrely banyshed and no more to be\r\nused in Lincolles Inne.’ In 1520 the Bench determine ‘that the order of\r\nChristmas shall be broken up’; and from that date a ‘solemn Christmas’\r\nwas only occasionally kept, by agreement with the Temples. Both\r\nLincoln’s Inn and the Middle Temple had a ‘Prince,’ for instance, in\r\n1599. In 1616 the choice of a ‘Lieutenant’ at Christmas was forbidden\r\nby the Bench as ‘not accordinge to the auncyant Orders and usages of\r\nthe House.’ In 1624 the Christmas vacation ceased to be kept. There\r\nwere still ‘revels’ under ‘Masters of the Revels’ in Michaelmas and\r\nHilary terms, and there are notices of disorder at Christmas in 1660\r\nand 1662. But the last ‘Prince’ of Lincoln’s Inn, was probably the\r\nPrince de la Grange of 1661, who had the honour of entertaining Charles\r\nII[1503].\r\n\r\nThe Inner Temple held ‘grand Christmasses’ as well as ‘revels’ on All\r\nSaints’, Candlemas, and Ascension days. The details of the Christmas\r\nceremonies have been put together from old account books by Dugdale.\r\nThey began on St. Thomas’s day and ended on Twelfth night. On Christmas\r\nday came in the boar’s head. On St. Stephen’s day a cat and a fox\r\nwere hunted with nine or ten couple of hounds round the hall[1504].\r\nIn the first few days of January a banquet with a play and mask was\r\ngiven to the other Inns of Court and Chancery. The Christmas officers\r\nincluded a steward, marshal, butler, constable-marshal, master of the\r\ngame, lieutenant of the tower, and one or more masters of the revels.\r\nThe constable-marshal was the Lord of Misrule. He held a fantastic\r\ncourt on St. Stephen’s day[1505], and came into hall ‘on his mule’\r\nto devise sport on the banquetting night. In 1523 the Bench agreed\r\nnot to keep Christmas, but to allow minstrels to those who chose to\r\nstay. Soon after 1554 the Masters of Revels cease to be elected[1506].\r\nNevertheless there was a notable revel in 1561 at which Lord Robert\r\nDudley, afterwards earl of Leicester, was constable-marshal. He took\r\nthe title of ‘Palaphilos, prince of Sophie,’ and instituted an order of\r\nknights of Pegasus in the name of his mistress Pallas[1507]. In 1594\r\nthe Inner Temple had an emperor, who sent an ambassador to the revels\r\nof Gray’s Inn[1508]. In 1627 the appointment of a Lord of Misrule led\r\nto a disturbance between the ‘Temple Sparks’ and the city authorities.\r\nThe ‘lieutenant’ claimed to levy a ‘droit’ upon dwellers in Ram Alley\r\nand Fleet Street. The lord mayor intervened, an action which led to\r\nblows and the committal of the lieutenant to the counter, whence he\r\nescaped only by obtaining the mediation of the attorney-general, and\r\nmaking submission[1509]. A set of orders for Christmas issued by the\r\nBench in 1632 forbade ‘any going abroad out of the Circuit of this\r\nHouse, or without any of the Gates, by any Lord or other Gentleman, to\r\nbreak open any House, or Chamber; or to take anything in the name of\r\nRent, or a distress[1510].’\r\n\r\nThe Middle Temple held its ‘solemn revels’ and ‘post revels’ on All\r\nSaints and Candlemas days, and on the Saturdays between these dates;\r\nlikewise its ‘solemn Christmasses[1511].’ An account of the Christmas\r\nof 1599 was written by Sir Benjamin Rudyerd under the title of\r\n_Noctes Templariae: or, A Briefe Chronicle of the Dark Reigne of the\r\nBright Prince of Burning Love_. ‘Sur Martino’ was the Prince, and one\r\n‘Milorsius Stradilax’ served as butt and buffoon to the company. A\r\nmasque and barriers at court, other masques and comedies, a progress, a\r\nmock trial, a ‘Sacrifice of Love,’ visits to the Lord Mayor and to and\r\nfrom Lincoln’s Inn, made up the entertainment[1512]. In 1631 orders for\r\nChristmas government were made by the Bench[1513]. In 1635 a Cornish\r\ngentleman, Francis Vivian, sat as Prince d’Amour. It cost him £2,000,\r\nbut after his deposition he was knighted at Whitehall. His great day\r\nwas February 24, when he entertained the Princes Palatine, Charles,\r\nand Rupert, with Davenant’s masque of the _Triumphs of the Prince\r\nd’Amour_[1514].\r\n\r\nThere is no very early mention of revels at Gray’s Inn, but they were\r\nheld on Saturdays between All Saints and Candlemas about 1529, and by\r\n1550 the solemn observation of Christmas was occasionally used. In 1585\r\nthe Bench forbade that any one should ‘in time of Christmas, or any\r\nother time, take upon him, or use the name, place, or commandment of\r\n_Lord_, or any such other like[1515].’ Nevertheless in 1594 one of the\r\nmost famous of all the legal ‘solemn Christmasses’ was held at this\r\nInn. Mr. Henry Helmes, of Norfolk, was ‘Prince of Purpoole[1516],’\r\nand he had the honour of presenting a mask before Elizabeth. This was\r\nwritten by Francis Davison, and Francis Bacon also contributed to the\r\nspeeches at the revels. But the great glory of this Christmas came to\r\nit by accident. On Innocents’ day there had been much confusion, and\r\nthe invited Templarians had retired in dudgeon. To retrieve the evening\r\n‘a company of base and common fellows’ was brought in and performed ‘a\r\nComedy of Errors, like to Plautus his Menaechmus[1517].’ In 1617 there\r\nwas again a Prince of Purpoole, on this occasion for the entertainment\r\nof Bacon himself as Lord Chancellor[1518]. Orders of 1609 and 1628\r\nmention respectively the ‘twelve’ and the ‘twenty’ days of Christmas\r\nas days of license, when caps may be doffed and cards or dice played in\r\nthe hall[1519]: and the duration of the Gray’s Inn revels is marked by\r\nnotices of Masters of the Revels as late as 1682 and even 1734[1520].\r\n\r\nNobles and even private gentlemen would set up a Lord of Misrule\r\nin their houses. The household regulations of the fifth earl of\r\nNorthumberland include in a list of rewards usually paid about 1522,\r\none of twenty shillings if he had an ‘Abbot of Miserewll’ at Christmas,\r\nand this officer, like his fellow at court, was distinct from the\r\n‘Master of the Revells’ for whom provision is also made[1521]. In\r\n1556 the marquis of Winchester, then lord treasurer, had a ‘lord of\r\nmysrulle’ in London, who came to bid my lord mayor to dinner with ‘a\r\ngrett mene of musysyonars and dyssegyssyd’ amongst whom ‘a dullvyll\r\nshuting of fyre’ and one ‘lyke Deth with a dart in hand[1522].’ In 1634\r\nRichard Evelyn of Wotton, high sheriff of Surrey and Sussex, issued\r\n‘Articles’ appointing Owen Flood his trumpeter ‘Lord of Misrule of all\r\ngood Orders during the twelve dayes[1523].’ The custom was imitated by\r\nmore than one municipal ape of gentility. The lord mayor and sheriffs\r\nof London had their Lords of Misrule until the court of common council\r\nput down the expense in 1554[1524]. Henry Rogers, mayor of Coventry,\r\nin 1517, and Richard Dutton, mayor of Chester, in 1567, entertained\r\nsimilar officers[1525].\r\n\r\nI have regarded the Lord of Misrule, amongst the courtly and wealthy\r\nclasses of English society, as a direct offshoot from the vanished\r\nFeast of Fools. The ecclesiastical suggestion in the alternative\r\ntitle, more than once found, of ‘Abbot of Misrule,’ seems to justify\r\nthis way of looking at the matter. But I do not wish to press it too\r\nclosely. For after all the Lord of Misrule, like the Bishop of Fools\r\nhimself, is only a variant of the winter ‘king’ known to the folk. In\r\nsome instances it is difficult to say whether it is the folk custom\r\nor the courtly custom with which you have to do. Such is the ‘kyng of\r\nCrestemesse’ of Norwich in 1443[1526]. Such are the Lords of Misrule\r\nwhom Machyn records as riding to the city from Westminster in 1557 and\r\nWhitechapel in 1561[1527]. And there is evidence that the term was\r\nfreely extended to folk ‘kings’ set up, not at Christmas only, but at\r\nother times in the year[1528]. It was a folk and a Christmas Lord whose\r\nattempted suppression by Sir Thomas Corthrop, the reforming curate\r\nof Harwich, got him into trouble with the government of Henry VIII\r\nin 1535[1529]. And it was folk rather than courtly Lords which, when\r\nthe reformers got their own way, were hardest hit by the inhibitions\r\ncontained in the visitation articles of archbishop Grindal and\r\nothers[1530]. So this discussion, _per ambages atque aequora vectus_,\r\ncomes round to the point at which it began. It is a far cry from\r\nTertullian to Bishop Grosseteste and a far cry from Bishop Grosseteste\r\nto Archbishop Grindal, but each alike voices for his own day the\r\nrelentless hostility of the austerer clergy during all ages to the\r\nineradicable _ludi_ of the pagan inheritance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             END OF VOL.

Cf. the edition by W. Meyer,\r\n1880. The other fragments of the mimographs are included in O. Ribbeck,\r\n_Comicorum Romanorum Fragmenta_ (3rd ed. 1898). Philistion of Bithynia,\r\nabout the time of Tiberius, gave the mime a literary form once more in\r\nhis κωμῳδίαι βιολογικαί (J. Denis, _La Com. grecque_, ii. 544; Croiset,\r\n_Hist. de la Litt. grecque_, v. 449).\r\n\r\n[9] _Incerti_ (fourth century) _ad Terentium_ (ed.

Augusta, Vita Heliogabali_, 25 ‘in mimicis adulteriis ea\r\nquae solent simulato fieri effici ad verum iussit’; cf. the _pyrrichae_\r\ndescribed by Suetonius, _Nero_, 12. The Roman taste for bloodshed\r\nwas sometimes gratified by mimes given in the amphitheatre, and\r\ndesigned to introduce the actual execution of a criminal. Martial, _de\r\nSpectaculis_, 7, mentions the worrying and crucifixion of a brigand in\r\nthe mime _Laureolus_, by order of Domitian:\r\n\r\n    ‘nuda Caledonio sic pectora praebuit urso\r\n    non falsa pendens in cruce Laureolus.’\r\n\r\n[12] Martial, i. 1; Ausonius, _Ecl._ xviii. 25; Lactantius (†300), _de\r\nInst. div._ i. 20. 10. Probably the influence of a piece of folk-ritual\r\nis to be traced here.\r\n\r\n[13] The ‘mimus’ type is exactly reproduced by more than one popular\r\nperformer on the modern ‘variety’ or ‘burlesque’ stage.\r\n\r\n[14] Macrobius, _Sat._ ii. 7; Cicero, _ad Atticum_, xiv. 3; Suetonius,\r\n_Augustus_, 45, 68; _Tiberius_, 45; _Caligula_, 27; _Nero_, 39;\r\n_Galba_, 13; _Vespasian_, 19; _Domitian_, 10; _Hist.

For the origin of the name, cf. Livy, vii. 2\r\n‘ister Tusco verbo ludius vocabatur.’ Besides _ludius_, _actor_ is good\r\nLatin. But it is generally used in some such phrase as _actor primarum\r\npersonarum_, protagonist, and by itself often means _dominus gregis_,\r\nmanager of the _grex_ or company. _Mimus_ signifies both performer\r\nand performance, _pantomimus_ the performer only. He is said _saltare\r\nfabulas_.\r\n\r\n[19] Dion Cassius, liv. 17.\r\n\r\n[20] Tacitus, _Annales_, i. 77; iv. 14; Dion Cassius, lvii. 21;\r\nSuetonius, _Tiberius_, 37.\r\n\r\n[21] Tacitus, _Annales_, xiii. 25; xiv. 21; Dion Cassius, lix. 2; lxi.\r\n8; lxviii. 10; Suetonius, _Nero_, 16, 26; _Titus_, 7; _Domitian_, 7;\r\nPliny, _Paneg._ 46; _Hist.

It was\r\ndanced in the amphitheatre.\r\n\r\n[23] Valerius Maximus, ii. 6. 7 ‘eadem civitas severitatis custos\r\nacerrima est: nullum aditum in scenam mimis dando, quorum argumenta\r\nmaiore in parte stuprorum continent actus; ne talia spectandi\r\nconsuetudo etiam imitandi licentiam sumat.’\r\n\r\n[24] A.

Digest_, iii. 2. 1 ‘infamia notatur qui ... artis ludicrae\r\npronuntiandive causa in scaenam prodierit.’ The jurists limited the\r\napplication of the rule to professional actors. _Thymelici_, or\r\norchestral musicians, were exempt. Diocletian made a further exemption\r\nfor persons appearing in their minority (_C. I. C. Cod. Iust._ ii.\r\n11. 21). The censors, on the other hand, spared the _Atellani_, whose\r\nperformances had a traditional connexion with religious rites.\r\n\r\n[25] _C. I. L._ i. 122.\r\n\r\n[26] _C. I. C.

An attempt to restore the old usage\r\nunder Tiberius was unsuccessful.\r\n\r\n[29] Caesar was tolerably magnanimous, for Laberius had already taken\r\nhis revenge in a scurrilous prologue. It had its touch of pathos, too:\r\n\r\n    ‘eques Romanus lare egressus meo\r\n    domum revertar mimus.’\r\n\r\n[30] Cicero, _ad Fam._ x. 32; Dion Cassius, xlviii. 33; liii. 31; liv.\r\n2; lvi. 47; lvii. 14; lix. 10; lxi. 9; lxv. 6; Tacitus, _Ann._ xiv. 20;\r\n_Hist._ ii. 62; Suetonius, _Augustus_, 45; _Domitian_, 8.\r\n\r\n[31] Suetonius, _Nero_, 21; Tacitus, _Ann._ xiv. 14; Juvenal, viii.\r\n198; Pseudo-Lucian, _Nero_, 9.\r\n\r\n[32] Dion Cassius, lxxvii. 21; _Hist.

Aurelius, _Comm._ xi. 6; _Hist. Augusta, Vita M. Aurel._ 15.\r\nThis refers directly to the _circus_.\r\n\r\n[37] Gibbon, ii. 447; Schaff, v. 49; Dill, 34, 100; P. Allard, _Julien\r\nl’Apostat_, i. 272; Alice Gardner, _Julian the Apostate_, 201; G.\r\nH. Rendall, _The Emperor Julian_ (1879), 106. The most interesting\r\npassage is a fragmentary ‘pastoral letter’ to a priest (ed. Hertlein,\r\n_Fragm. Ep._ p. 304 B; cf. _Ep._ 49, p. 430 B); Julian requires the\r\npriests to abstain even from reading the Old Comedy (_Fragm. Ep._ p.\r\n300 D). He also thinks that the moral layman should avoid the theatre\r\n(_Misopogon_, p. 343 c).\r\n\r\n[38] On the critical problem offered by such _vitae_ cf. Prof. Bury in\r\nGibbon, i. l. B. von der Lage, _Studien zur Genesius-legende_ (1898),\r\nattempts to show that the legends of St. Genesius (_Acta SS. Aug._ v.\r\n122), St. Gelasius (_Acta SS. Feb._ iii. 680), St. Ardalio (_Acta SS.\r\nApr._ ii. 213), St. Porphyrius (_Acta SS. Sept._ v. 37), and another\r\nSt. Porphyrius (_Acta SS. Nov._ ii. 230) are all variants of a Greek\r\nstory originally told of an anonymous _mimus_. The _Passio_ of St.\r\nGenesius represents him as a _magister mimithemelae artis_, converted\r\nwhile he was mimicking a baptism before Diocletian and martyred. It\r\nprofesses to give part of the dialogue of the mime. The legends of\r\nSt. Philemon (_Menologium Basilii_, ii. 59; cf. _Acta SS. Mar._ i.\r\n751) and St. Pelagia or Margarita (_Acta SS. Oct._ iv. 248) appear to\r\nbe distinct. Palladius, _Vita Chrysostomi_, 8, records how the stage\r\nof Antioch in the fifth century rang with the scandals caused by the\r\npatriarch Severus and other Monophysite heretics.\r\n\r\n[39] Tertullian, _De Spect._, especially cc. 4, 26, 30. Schaff, iv.\r\n833, dates the treatise †200. An earlier Greek writing by Tertullian on\r\nthe same subject is lost; cf. also his _Apologeticus_, 15 (_P. L._ i.\r\n357). The information as to the contemporary stage scattered through\r\nTertullian’s works is collected by E. Nöldechen, _Tertullian und das\r\nTheater_ (_Z. f. Kirchengeschichte_ (1894), xv. 161). An anonymous _De\r\nSpectaculis_, formerly ascribed to St. Cyprian, follows on Tertullian’s\r\nlines (_P. L._ iv. 779, transl. in _Ante-Nicene Christian Libr._ xiii.\r\n221).\r\n\r\n[40] Tatian, _ad Graecos_, 22 (_P. G._ vi. 856); Minucius Felix,\r\n_Octavius_, 27 (_P. L._ iii. 352); Cyprian, _Epist._ i. 8 (_P. L._\r\niv. 207); Lactantius, _de Inst. div._ vi. 20 (_P. L._ vi. 710), ‘quid\r\nde mimis loquar, corruptelarum praeferentibus disciplinam, qui docent\r\nadulteria, dum fingunt, et simulatis erudiunt ad vera?’; cf. Du\r\nMéril, _Or. Lat._ 6; Schaff, iii. 339. A remarkable collection of all\r\nconceivable authorities against the stage is given by Prynne, 566, 685,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n[41] _Canones Hippolyti_, 67 (Duchesne, 509) ‘Quicumque fit θεατρικός\r\nvel gladiator et qui currit vel docet voluptates vel [_illegible_]\r\nvel [_illegible_] vel κυνηγός vel ἱπποδρόμος [?], vel qui cum bestiis\r\npugnat vel idolorum sacerdos, hi omnes non admittuntur ad sermones\r\nsacros nisi prius ab illis immundis operibus purgentur.’ This is from\r\nan Arabic translation of a lost Greek original. M. Duchesne says ‘ce\r\nrecueil de prescriptions liturgiques et disciplinaires est sûrement\r\nantérieur au iv^e siècle, et rien ne s’oppose à ce qu’il remonte à la\r\ndate indiquée par le nom d’Hippolyte’ [†198-236].\r\n\r\n[42] _Conc. Illib._ cc. 62, 67 (Mansi, ii. 16); _Conc. Arelat._ c. 5\r\n(Mansi, ii. 471); 3 _Conc. Carth._ cc. 11, 35 (Mansi, iii. 882, 885); 4\r\n_Conc. Carth._ cc. 86, 88 (Mansi, iii. 958).\r\n\r\n[43] The strongest pronouncement is that of Augustine and others in 3\r\n_Conc. Carth._ c. 11 ‘ut filii episcoporum vel clericorum spectacula\r\nsaecularia non exhibeant, sed non spectent, quandoquidem ab spectaculo\r\net omnes laici prohibeantur. Semper enim Christianis omnibus hoc\r\ninterdictum est, ut ubi blasphemi sunt, non accedant.’\r\n\r\n[44] 4 _Conc. Carth._ c. 88 ‘Qui die solenni, praetermisso solenni\r\necclesiae conventu, ad spectacula vadit, excommunicetur.’\r\n\r\n[45] _D. C. A._ s. vv. _Actor_, _Theatre_; Bingham, vi. 212, 373,\r\n439; Alt, 310; Prynne, 556. Some, however, of the pronouncements of\r\nthe fathers came to have equal force with the decrees of councils in\r\ncanon law. The _Code_ of Gratian (†1139), besides 3 _Conc. Carth._ c.\r\n35 ‘scenicis atque ystrionibus, ceterisque huiusmodi personis, vel\r\napostaticis conversis, vel reversis ad Deum, gratia vel reconciliatio\r\nnon negetur’ (_C. I. Can._ iii. 2. 96) and 7 _Conc. Carth._ (419)\r\nc. 2 (Mansi, iv. 437) ‘omnes etiam infamiae maculis aspersi, id est\r\nhistriones ... ab accusatione prohibentur’ (_C. I. Can._ ii. 4. 1. 1),\r\nincludes two patristic citations. One is Cyprian, _Ep._ lxi. (_P. L._\r\niv. 362), which is ‘de ystrione et mago illo, qui apud vos constitutus\r\nadhuc in suae artis dedecore perseverat,’ and forbids ‘sacra communio\r\ncum ceteris Christianis dari’ (_C. I. Can._ iii. 2. 95); the other\r\nAugustine, _Tract. C. ad c. 16 Iohannis_ (_P. L._ xxxv. 1891) ‘donare\r\nres suas histrionibus vitium est immane, non virtus’ (_C. I. Can._ i.\r\n86. 7). Gratian adds Isidorus Hispalensis, _de Eccl. Off._ ii. 2 (_P.\r\nL._ lxxxiii. 778) ‘his igitur lege Patrum cavetur, ut a vulgari vita\r\nseclusi a mundi voluptatibus sese abstineant; non spectaculis, non\r\npompis intersint’ (_C. I. Can._ i. 23. 3).\r\n\r\n[46] Sathas, 7; Krumbacher, 644. Anastasius Sinaita (bp. of Antioch,\r\n564) in his tract, _Adversus Monophysitas ac Monothelitas_ (Mai,\r\n_Coll. Nov. Script. Vet._ vii. 202), speaks of the συγγράμματα of the\r\nArians as θυμελικὰς βίβλους, and calls the Arian Eunomius πρωτοστάτης\r\nτῆς Ἀρείου θυμελικῆς ὀρχήστρας. I doubt if these phrases should be\r\ntaken too literally; possibly they are not more than a criticism of\r\nthe buffoonery and levity which the fragments of the Θάλεια display.\r\nKrumbacher mentions an orthodox Ἀντιθάλεια of which no more seems to be\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n[47] Alt, 310; Bingham, vi. 273; Schaff, v. 106, 125; Haigh, 460; Dill,\r\n56; P. Allard, _Julien l’Apostat_. i. 230. The _Codex Theodosianus_,\r\ndrawn up and accepted for both empires †435, contains imperial edicts\r\nfrom the time of Constantine onwards.\r\n\r\n[48] _Spectacula_ are forbidden on Sunday, unless it is the emperor’s\r\nbirthday, by _C. Th._ xv. 5. 2 (386), which also forbids judges to rise\r\nfor them, except on special occasions, and _C. Th._ ii. 8. 23 (399).\r\nThe exception is removed by _C. Th._ ii. 8. 25 (409) and _C. Iust._\r\niii. 12. 9 (469). The Christian feasts and fasts, Christmas, Epiphany,\r\nthe first week in Lent, Passion and Easter weeks are added by _C.\r\nTh._ ii. 8. 23 (400) and _C. Th._ xv. 5. 5 (425). According to some\r\nMSS. this was done by _C. Th._ ii. 8. 19 (389), but the events of 399\r\nrecorded below seem to show that 400 is the right date.\r\n\r\n[49] _C. Th._ xv. 7. 1, 2 (371); xv. 7. 4 (380); xv. 7. 9 (381).\r\nHistorians have seen in some of these rescripts which are dated from\r\nMilan the influence of St. Ambrose. _C. Th._ xv. 7. 13 (414) seems to\r\nwithdraw the concessions, in the interest of the public _voluptates_,\r\nbut this may have been only a temporary or local measure.\r\n\r\n[50] _C. Th._ xv. 7. 11 (393); xv. 7. 12 (394); xv. 13. 1 (396).\r\n\r\n[51] _C. Th._ iv. 6. 3 (336) ‘scenicae ... quarum venenis inficiuntur\r\nanimi perditorum’; xv. 7. 8 (381), of the relapsing _scenica_,\r\n‘permaneat donec anus ridicula, senectute deformis, nec tunc quidem\r\nabsolutione potiatur, cum aliud quam casta esse non possit.’\r\n\r\n[52] _C. Th._ xv. 7. 12 (394).\r\n\r\n[53] _C. Th._ xv. 6. 2 (399) is explicit, ‘ludicras artes concedimus\r\nagitari, ne ex nimia harum restrictione tristitia generetur.’\r\n\r\n[54] _C. Th._ vi. 4. 2 (327); vi. 4. 4 (339); vi. 4. 29 (396); vi.\r\n4. 32 (397). It appears from the decree of 396 that the ‘theatralis\r\ndispensio’ of the praetors had been diverted to the building of an\r\naqueduct; they are now to give ‘scenicas voluptates’ again. Symmachus,\r\n_Ep._ vi. 42, describes his difficulties in getting _scenici_ for his\r\nson’s praetorship, which cost him £80,000. They were lost at sea; cf.\r\nDill, 151.\r\n\r\n[55] See Appendix A.\r\n\r\n[56] _C. Th._ xv. 7. 5 (380); xv. 7. 10 (385); _C. Iust._ xi. 41. 5\r\n(409).\r\n\r\n[57] _C. Th._ xv. 7. 8 (381); xiv. 7. 3 (412).\r\n\r\n[58] _C. Th._ xvi. 10. 3 (346). But _C. Th._ xvi. 10. 17 (399) forbids\r\n‘voluptates’ to be connected with sacrifice or superstition.\r\n\r\n[59] A. Puech, _St. Jean Chrysostome et les Mœurs de son Temps_ (1891),\r\n266, has an interesting chapter on the _spectacula_. He refers to\r\n_Hom. in Matt._ 6, 7, 37, 48; _Hom. in Ioann._ 18; _Hom. in Ep._ 1 _ad\r\nThess._ 5; _Hom. de Dav. et Saul_, 3; _Hom. in Prisc. et Aquil._ 1, &c.\r\nMost of these works belong to the Antioch period; cf. also Allard, i.\r\n229. In _de Sacerdotio_ 1, Chrysostom, like Augustine, records his own\r\ndelight in the stage as a young man.\r\n\r\n[60] _P. G._ lvi. 263.\r\n\r\n[61] _C. I. C. Nov. Iust._ cv. 1 (536) ‘faciet processum qui ad\r\ntheatrum ducit, quem pornas vocant, ubi in scena ridiculorum est locus\r\ntragoedis et thymelicis choris’; cf. Choricius, _Apology for Mimes_,\r\ned. Ch. Graux, in _R. d. Philologie_, i. 209; Krumbacher, 646.\r\n\r\n[62] _C. Th._ iv. 6. 3 (336); _C. Iust._ v. 5. 7 (454).\r\n\r\n[63] _C. Iust._ v. 4. 23 (520-3) allows the marriage on condition of\r\nan imperial rescript and a _dotale instrumentum_. _C. Iust._ i. 4. 33\r\n(534) waives the rescript. It also imposes penalties on _fideiussores_\r\nor sureties of actresses who hinder them from conversion and quitting\r\nthe stage. For similar legislation cf. _Nov._ li; lxxxix. 15; cxvii.\r\n4. By _Nov._ cxvii. 8. 6 a man is permitted to turn his wife out of\r\ndoors and afterwards repudiate her, if she goes to theatre, circus, or\r\namphitheatre without his knowledge or against his will.\r\n\r\n[64] Gibbon, iv. 212, 516 (with Prof. Bury’s additions); C. E. Mallet\r\nin _E. H. Review_, ii. 1; A. Debidour, _L’Impératrice Théodora_,\r\n59. Neither Prof. Bury nor the editor of the _C. I. C._ accepts M.\r\nDebidour’s dating of _C. Iust._ v. 4. 23 under Justinian in 534.\r\n\r\n[65] Mansi, xi. 943. Canon 3 excludes one who has married a σκηνική\r\nfrom orders. C. 24 forbids priests and monks θυμελικῶν παιγνίων\r\nἀνέχεσθαι, and confirms a decree of the council of Laodicea (cf. p.\r\n24, n. 4) obliging them, if present at a wedding, to leave the room\r\nbefore τὰ παίγνια are introduced. C. 51 condemns, both for clergy\r\nand laity, τοὺς λεγομένους μίμους καὶ τὰ τούτων θέατρα and τὰς ἐπὶ\r\nσκηνῶν ὀρχήσεις. For clergy the penalty is degradation, for laity\r\nexcommunication. C. 61 provides a six-years’ excommunication for\r\nbear-leaders and such. C. 62 deals with pagan religious festivals of a\r\nsemi-theatrical character; cf. ch. xiv. C. 66 forbids the circus or any\r\nδημώδης θέα in Easter week.\r\n\r\n[66] Sathas, _passim_; Krumbacher, 644.\r\n\r\n[67] Jerome, _in Ezechiel_ (410-15) ‘a. spectaculis removeamus\r\noculos arenae circi theatri’ (_P.

Mr. Dill shows in the third book of his\r\nadmirable work that bad government and bad finance had much more to do\r\nwith the breakdown of the Empire than the bad morals of the stage.\r\n\r\n[73] Dill, 58, 137; Hodgkin, i. 930. Salvian was a priest of\r\nMarseilles, and wrote between 439 and 451.\r\n\r\n[74] Salvian, vi. 31 ‘quae est enim in baptismo salutari Christianorum\r\nprima confessio? quae scilicet nisi ut renuntiare se diabolo ac\r\npompis eius et spectaculis atque operibus protestentur?’ The natural\r\ninterpretation of this is that the word ‘spectaculis’ actually\r\noccurred in the _formula abrenuntiationis_. Was this so? It was not\r\nwhen Tertullian wrote (†200). He gives the _formula_ as ‘renunciare\r\ndiabolo et pompae et angelis eius,’ and goes on to argue that visiting\r\n‘spectacula’ amounts to ‘idolatria,’ or worship of the ‘diabolus’\r\n(_de Spectaculis_, c. 4). Nor is the word used in any of the numerous\r\nversions of the _formula_ given by Schaff, iii. 248; Duchesne, 293;\r\nMartene, i. 44; Martin von Bracara, _de Caeremoniis_ (ed.

L._ lxxx.\r\n370), conveys his decision to the bishop. He says, ‘obiectum hoc, quod\r\nde ludis theatriis taurorum, scilicet, ministerio sis adeptus nulli\r\nvidetur incertum; quis non videat quod etiam videre poeniteat.’ But I\r\ncannot find in Sisebut or in Mariana, who writes Spanish, the words\r\nquoted by Du Méril. For ‘taurorum’ one MS. has ‘phanorum.’ I suspect\r\nthe former is right. A bull-fight sounds so Spanish, and such festivals\r\nof heathen origin as the _Kalends_ (cf. ch. xi) were not held in\r\ntheatres. A. Gassier, _Le Théâtre espagnol_ (1898), 14, thinks such a\r\nfestival is intended; if so, ‘theatriis’ probably means not literally,\r\n‘in a theatre,’ but merely ‘theatrical’; cf. the ‘ludi theatrales’ of\r\nthe Feast of Fools (ch. xiii). In any case there is no question of\r\n‘scenici.’\r\n\r\n[88] Isidorus Hispalensis, _Etymologiarum_ (600-636), xviii. 42 (_P.\r\nL._ lxxxii. 658).\r\n\r\n[89] Macrobius, _Saturnalia_, ii. 1. 5, 9.\r\n\r\n[90] Chrysostom, _Hom. in Ep. ad Col. cap._ 1, _Hom._ i. cc. 5, 6 (_P.\r\nG._ lxii. 306).\r\n\r\n[91] Jerome, _Ep._ 117 (_P.

The shades of opinion on the\r\nexact relation of the _cantilenae_ to the _chansons de gestes_ are\r\nnumerous.\r\n\r\n[104] _Vita S. Willelmi_ (_Acta SS. Maii_, vi. 801) ‘qui chori iuvenum,\r\nqui conventus populorum, praecipue militum ac nobilium virorum, quae\r\nvigiliae sanctorum dulce non resonant, et modulatis vocibus decantant\r\nqualis et quantus fuerit’; cf. Gautier, i. 66. The merest fragments\r\nof such folk-song heroic _cantilenae_ are left. A German one, the\r\nLudwigslied, on the battle of Saucourt (881) is in Müllenhoff und\r\nScherer, _Denkmäler deutscher Poesie und Prosa_ (1892), N^o. xi; cf.\r\nKögel, i. 2. 86; Gautier, i. 62. And a few lines of a (probably)\r\nFrench one on an event in the reign of Clotaire (†620) are translated\r\ninto Latin in Helgarius (†853-76), _Vita S. Faronis_ (_Historiens de\r\nFrance_, iii. 505; Mabillon, _Acta SS. Benedictinorum_, ii. 610).\r\nHelgarius calls the song a ‘carmen rusticum’ and says ‘ex qua victoria\r\ncarmen publicum iuxta rusticitatem per omnium pene volitabat ora ita\r\ncanentium, feminaeque choros inde plaudendo componebant.’ The _Vita S.\r\nFaronis_ in _Acta SS._ lx. 612, which is possibly an abridgement of\r\nHelgarius, says ‘carmine rustico ... suavi cantilena decantabatur’; cf.\r\nGautier, i. 47; Gröber, ii. 1. 446.\r\n\r\n[105] Ten Brink, i. 148, quotes from _Hist. Ely_, ii. 27 (†1166), a\r\nfragment of a song on Canute, ‘quae usque hodie in choris publice\r\ncantantur,’ and mentions another instance from Wm. of Malmesbury. Cf.\r\n_de Gestis Herewardi Saxonis_ (Michel, _Chron. Anglo-Norm._ ii. 6)\r\n‘mulieres et puellae de eo in choris canebant,’ and for Scotland the\r\nsong on Bannockburn (1314) which, says Fabyan, _Chronicle_ (ed. Ellis),\r\n420, ‘was after many days sungyn in dances, in carolles of ye maydens\r\nand mynstrellys of Scotlande’; cf. also Gummere, _B. P._ 265.\r\n\r\n[106] It is important to recognize that the _cantilenae_ of the\r\nfolk and those of the professional singers existed side by side.\r\nBoth are, I think, implied in the account of the St. William songs\r\nquoted above: the folk sung them in choruses and on wake-days, the\r\nprofessional singers in the assemblies of warriors. At any rate, in the\r\nnext (twelfth) cent. Ordericus Vitalis, vi. 3 (ed. _Soc. de l’Hist.\r\nde France_, iii. 5), says of the same Willelmus, ‘Vulgo canitur a\r\nioculatoribus de illo cantilena.’ M. Gautier (ii. 6) will not admit\r\nthe filiation of the _ioculatores_ to the _scôpas_, and therefore he\r\nis led to suppose (i. 78) that the _cantilenae_ and _vulgaria carmina_\r\nwere all folk-song up to the end of the tenth cent. and that then the\r\n_ioculatores_ got hold of them and lengthened them into _chansons de\r\ngestes_. But, as we shall see (p. 34), the Franks certainly had their\r\nprofessional singers as early as Clovis, and these cannot well have\r\nsung anything but heroic lays. Therefore the _cantilenae_ and _vulgaria\r\ncarmina_ of the Merovingian and Carolingian periods may have been\r\neither folk-song, or _scôp_-song, or, more probably, both (Gröber, ii.\r\n1. 449). _Cantilena_ really means no more than ‘chant’ of any kind;\r\nit includes ecclesiastical chant. So Alcuin uses it (e.g. _Ep._ civ.\r\nin Dümmler, ii. 169); and what Gautier, ii. 65, prints as a folk-song\r\n_cantilena_ of S. Eulalia is treated by Gröber, ii. 1. 442, as a\r\nsequence.\r\n\r\n[107] Gummere, _G.

L._ 455, from the _Speculum Caritatis_ of\r\nAbbot Ælred of Rievaulx.\r\n\r\n[120] Bede to Egbert in 734 (Haddan-Stubbs, iii. 315) ‘de quibusdam\r\nepiscopis fama vulgatum est ... quod ipsi ... secum habeant ... illos\r\nqui risui, iocis, fabulis ... subigantur.’\r\n\r\n[121] Gutberchtus to Lullus in 764 (Dümmler, _Epist.

S. 11,\r\n20, 80, 257) record that he himself learnt the ‘ars citharizandi.’ One\r\nday he hung ‘citharam suam quam lingua paterna hearpam vocamus’ on the\r\nwall, and it discoursed an anthem by itself. Anthems, doubtless, were\r\nhis mature recreation, but as a young clerk he was accused ‘non saluti\r\nanimae profutura sed avitae gentilitatis vanissima didicisse carmina,\r\net historiarum frivovolas colere incantationum naenias.’\r\n\r\n[124] _Anglo-Saxon Canons of Edgar_ (906), can. 58 (Wilkins, i. 228),\r\n_sic Latine_, ‘docemus artem, ut nullus sacerdos sit cerevisarius,\r\nnec aliquo modo scurram agat secum ipso, vel aliis’; _Oratio Edgari\r\nRegis_ (969) _pro monachatu propaganda_ (Wilkins, i. 246) ‘ut iam domus\r\nclericorum putentur ... conciliabulum histrionum ... mimi cantant et\r\nsaltant.’\r\n\r\n[125] Strutt, 172 and _passim_.\r\n\r\n[126] Wright-Wülker, 150, 311, 539. A synonym for _scôp_ is\r\n_leodwyrhta_. On 188 _lyricus_ is glossed _scôp_. But the distinctive\r\nuse of _scôp_ is not in all cases maintained, e.g. _tragicus vel\r\ncomicus unwurð scôp_ (188), _comicus scôp_ (283), _comicus id est\r\nqui comedia scribit, cantator vel artifex canticorum seculorum, idem\r\nsatyricus, i. scôp, ioculator, poeta_ (206). Other western peoples in\r\ncontact with Latin civilization came to make the same classification of\r\npoet and buffoon. Wackernagel, i. 51, says that the German _liuderi_\r\nor poet is opposed to the _skirnun_ or _tûmarâ_, _scurra_ or _mimus_.\r\nThe buffoon is looked askance at by the dignified Scandinavian men of\r\nletters (Saxo Grammaticus, _Hist. Danica_, transl. Elton, vi. 186);\r\nand Keltic bardism stands equally aloof from the _clerwr_ (cf. p. 76).\r\nOf course Kelts and Teutons might conceivably have developed their\r\nbuffoons for themselves, independently of Roman influence, but so far\r\nas the Germans go, Tacitus, _Germ._ 24, knows no _spectaculum_ but the\r\n_sweorda-gelác_ or sword-dance (ch. ix).\r\n\r\n[127] Brooke, i. 12; Merbot, 11. The _gleómon_, according to Merbot,\r\nbecame mixed with the _plegman_ or _mimus_. In the glosses _pleȝa_ =\r\n_ludus_ in the widest sense, including athletics; and _pleȝ-stowe_\r\n= _amphitheatrum_ (Wright-Wülker, 342). A synonym of _pleȝa_ is the\r\netymological equivalent of _ludus_, _lâc_ (cf. ch. viii). _Spil_ is not\r\nA. S., _spilian_, a loan-word (Kögel, i. 1. 11).\r\n\r\n[128] _Scôp_, the O. H. G. _scopf_ or _scof_ is the ‘shaper,’ ‘maker,’\r\nfrom _skapan_, ‘to make’; it is only a West-German word, and is\r\ndistinct from _scopf_, a ‘scoff,’ ‘mock,’ and also from O. N. _skald_.\r\nThis is not West-German, but both ‘sing’ and ‘say’ are from the same\r\nroot _seg_ (Kögel, i. 1. 140). _Gleómon_ is from _gleo_, _gleow_,\r\n_gliw_, _glig_ = ‘glee,’ ‘mirth.’ The harp, in _Beowulf_ and elsewhere,\r\nis the ‘glee-beam,’ ‘glee-wood.’\r\n\r\n[129] Jordanis, _de hist. Get._ (in _M. G. H._), c. 5 ‘ante quos etiam\r\ncantu maiorum facta modulationibus citharisque cantabant.’\r\n\r\n[130] Cassiodorus, _Variae_, ii. 40, 41. Kögel, i. 1. 130, thinks that\r\nthe professional singer, as distinct from the _chorus_, first became\r\nknown to the Franks on this occasion. But one may rather infer from\r\nTheodoric’s letter to Boethius that the _citharoedus_ was to replace\r\nbarbaric by civilized music.\r\n\r\n[131] Priscus, _Hist. Goth._ (ed.

This is interesting, because it contrasts the\r\n‘mobilitas histrionum’ which tempts the eye, with the ‘carmina poetarum\r\net comediarum mimorumque urbanitates et strophae,’ which tempt the ear.\r\nThis looks as if _histriones_, in the sense of _pantomimi_, were still\r\nknown, but the piece also mentions ‘teatrorum moles’ and ‘circenses,’\r\nand is, I suspect, quite antiquarian.\r\n\r\n[135] _Ep._ clxxv (799), to Adalhart, Bp. of Old Corbey, ‘Vereor, ne\r\nHomerus [Angilbert] irascatur contra cartam prohibentem spectacula et\r\ndiabolica figmenta. quae omnes sanctae scripturae prohibent, in tantum\r\nut legebam sanctum dicere Augustinum, “nescit homo, qui histriones\r\net mimos et saltatores introducit in domum suam, quam magna eos\r\nimmundorum sequitur turba spirituum.” sed absit ut in domo christiana\r\ndiabolus habeat potestatem’ (the quotation from Augustine cannot be\r\nidentified): _Ep._ ccxxxvii (801), also to Adalhart, ‘quod de emendatis\r\nmoribus Homeri mei scripsisti, satis placuit oculis meis ... unum fuit\r\nde histrionibus, quorum vanitatibus sciebam non parvum animae sui\r\npericulum imminere, quod mihi non placuit, ... mirumque mihi visum est,\r\nquomodo tam sapiens animus non intellexisset reprehensibilia dignitati\r\nsuae facere et non laudabilia.’ Angilbert also seems to have had\r\nrelations unbecoming an abbot with one of the ‘coronatae columbae.’\r\n\r\n[136] _Capit. of Mantua_ (Boretius, i. 195), can. 6 ‘neque ulla iocorum\r\ngenera ante se fieri permittant quae contra canonum auctoritatem\r\neveniunt.’\r\n\r\n[137] _Capit. Generale_ (Boretius, i. 64; _P. L._ xcvii. 188), c. 31\r\n‘ut episcopi et abbates et abbatissae cupplas canum non habeant, nec\r\nfalcones, nec accipitres, nec ioculatores.’ If this is the _carta_ of\r\nAlcuin’s _Ep._ clxxv, and I know of no other which it can be, Dümmler’s\r\ndate for the letter of 799 seems too late. Mabillon’s 791 is nearer the\r\nmark.\r\n\r\n[138] _Capit. Gen._ (Boretius, i. 96), can. 23 ‘cleri ... non inanis\r\nlusibus vel conviviis secularibus vel canticis vel luxuriosis usum\r\nhabeant.’\r\n\r\n[139] _Conc. of Tours_ (Mansi, xiv. 84), c. 7 ‘histrionum quoque\r\nturpium et obscoenorum insolentiis iocorum et ipsi [sacerdotes] animo\r\neffugere caeterisque sacerdotibus effugienda praedicare debent.’\r\n\r\n[140] Einhard, _Vita Caroli Magni_, c. 29 ‘barbara et antiquissima\r\ncarmina, quibus veterum regum actus et bella canebantur, scripsit\r\nmemoriaeque mandavit.’\r\n\r\n[141] Alcuin, _Ep._ cxlix (798), to Charlemagne, ‘ut puerorum saevitia\r\nvestrorum cuiuslibet carminis dulcedine mitigaretur, voluistis’;\r\nAlcuin, who doubtless had to _ménager_ Charlemagne a little, is\r\napparently to write the poem himself.\r\n\r\n[142] Kögel, i. 2. 222. The _Chronicon Novaliciense_, iii. 10,\r\ndescribes how after crossing Mt. Cenis in 773, Charlemagne was guided\r\nby a Lombard _ioculator_ who sung a ‘cantiunculam a se compositam de\r\neadem re rotando in conspectu suorum.’ As a reward the _ioculator_\r\nhad all the land over which his _tuba_ sounded on a hill could be\r\nheard. The _Monachus S. Galli_ (Jaffé, _Bibl. rer. Germ._ iv), i. 13,\r\ntells how (†783) a _scurra_ brought about a reconciliation between\r\nCharlemagne and his brother-in-law Uodalrich. The same writer (i. 33)\r\nmentions an ‘incomparabilis clericus’ of the ‘gloriosissimus Karolus,’\r\nwho ‘scientia ... cantilenae ecclesiasticae vel iocularis novaque\r\ncarminum compositione sive modulatione ... cunctos praecelleret.’\r\n\r\n[143] Philippe Mouskes, _de Poetis Provincialibus_ (quoted Ducange, s.\r\nv. _leccator_):\r\n\r\n    ‘Quar quant li buens Rois Karlemaigne\r\n    Ot toute mise à son demaine\r\n    Provence, qui mult iert plentive\r\n    De vins, de bois, d’aigue, de rive,\r\n    As lecours, as menestreus,\r\n    Qui sont auques luxurieus,\r\n    Le donna toute et departi.’\r\n\r\n[144] Kögel, i. 2. 220.\r\n\r\n[145] Theganus, _de gestis Ludovici Pii_ (_M. G. H. Scriptores_, ii.\r\n594), c. 19 ‘Poetica carmina gentilia, quae in iuventute didicerat,\r\nrespuit, nec legere nec audire nec docere voluit,’ and ‘nunquam in risu\r\nexaltavit vocem suam, nec quando in festivitatibus ad laetitiam populi\r\nprocedebant thymelici, scurrae, et mimi cum choraulis et citharistis\r\nad mensam coram eo, tunc ad mensuram ridebat populus coram eo, ille\r\nnunquam vel dentes candidos suos in risu ostendit.’ The ‘carmina\r\ngentilia,’ so much disliked by Louis, were probably Frankish and not\r\nclassic poems.\r\n\r\n[146] Benedictus Levita, vi. 205 (_M. G. H. Leges_, ii. 2. 83), ‘ne in\r\nillo sancto die vanis fabulis aut locutionibus sive cantationibus vel\r\nsaltationibus stando in biviis et plateis ut solet inserviant.’ On this\r\ncollection see Schaff, v. 272.\r\n\r\n[147] This capitulary is of doubtful date, but belongs to the reign\r\neither of Louis the Pious, or Lothair (Boretius, i. 334; Pertz, i.\r\n324; Ben. Levita, ii. 49) ‘ut in palatiis nostris ad accusandum et\r\niudicandum et testimonium faciendum non se exhibeant viles personae\r\net infames, histriones scilicet, nugatores, manzeres, scurrae,\r\nconcubinarii, ... aut servi aut criminosi’; cf. R. Sohm, _Die fränk.\r\nReichs-und Gerichtsverfassung_, 354.\r\n\r\n[148] For ninth-century prohibitions see _Statutes_ of Haito, Bp. of\r\nBasle (807-23), c. 11 (Boretius, i. 364); _Conc. of Maintz_ (847), c.\r\n13 (Boretius, ii. 179); _Conc. of Maintz_ (852), c. 6 (Boretius, ii.\r\n187); _Capit._ of Walter of Orleans (858), c. 17 (Mansi, xv. 507),\r\n_Capit._ of Hincmar of Rheims (_P.

L._ civ. 249) ‘satiat praeterea et\r\ninebriat histriones, mimos, turpissimosque et vanissimos ioculares, cum\r\npauperes ecclesiae fame discruciati intereant.’\r\n\r\n[149] Otto Frisingensis, _Chronicon_, vi. 32, records of the Emperor\r\nHenry III in 1045 that ‘quumque ex more regio nuptias Inglinheim\r\ncelebraret, omne balatronum et histrionum collegium, quod, ut assolet,\r\neo confluxerat, vacuum abire permisit, pauperibusque ea quae membris\r\ndiaboli subtraxerat, large distribuit.’ After the death of the Emperor\r\nHenry I of Germany his widow Matilda ‘neminem voluit audire carmina\r\nsaecularia cantantem’ (_Vita Machtildis Antiquior_ in _M. G. H.\r\nScriptores_, iv. 294).\r\n\r\n[150] Honorius Augustodunensis, _Elucidarium_ (†1092), ii. 18 (_P.

Officiis_, ii. 2 ‘His igitur lege Patrum cavetur, ut a vulgari\r\nvita seclusi a mundi voluptatibus sese abstineant; non spectaculis,\r\nnon pompis intersint’: (_b_) i. 44. 7, _ex Conc. Nannetensi_ ‘Nullus\r\npresbyterorum ... quando ad collectam presbyteri convenerit ... plausus\r\net risus inconditos, et fabulas inanes ibi referre aut cantare\r\npraesumat, aut turpia ioca vel urso vel tornatricibus ante se fieri\r\npatiatur’; I cannot identify the Council of Nantes referred to: the\r\ncanon is not amongst those supposed to belong to the Council of 660,\r\nand given by Mansi, xviii. 166: (_c_) i. 46. 6, _ex Conc. Carthag._ iv.\r\nc. 60 [398. Mansi, iii. 956] ‘Clericum scurrilem et verbis turpibus\r\nioculatorem ab officio retrahendum censemus’: (_d_) ii. 4. 1. 1, _ex\r\nConc. Carthag._ vii (419) ‘Omnes etiam infamiae maculis aspersi, id est\r\nhistriones ... ab accusatione prohibentur.’ The _Decretum Gratiani_\r\nwas drawn up †1139. The _Decretales_ of Gregory IX (1234) incorporate\r\ncan. 16 of the _Lateran Council_ (Mansi, xxii. 1003), held in 1215\r\n(_Decr. Greg. IX_, iii. 1. 15) ‘[Clerici] mimis, ioculatoribus, et\r\nhistrionibus non intendant’; and the _Liber Sextus_ of Boniface VIII\r\n(1298) adds the following decree of that Pope (_Sext. Decr._ iii. 1.\r\n1) ‘Clerici qui, clericalis ordinis dignitati non modicum detrahentes,\r\nse ioculatores seu goliardos faciunt aut bufones, si per annum artem\r\nillam ignominiosam exercuerint, ipso iure, si autem tempore breviori,\r\net tertio moniti non resipuerint, careant omni privilegio clericali.’\r\n\r\n[152] Wilkins, i. 585. For can. 16 of the Lateran council see last\r\nnote. The prohibition is again confirmed by can. 17 of the Synod of\r\nExeter in 1287 (Wilkins, ii. 129).\r\n\r\n[153] _Constitutiones_ of Bp. Grosseteste in his _Epistolae_ (R.

Bourdillon (1897), 22.\r\nThe term ‘caitif’ has puzzled the editors. Surely the minstrel has\r\nin mind the abusive epithets with which the clergy bespattered his\r\nprofession. See Appendix B.\r\n\r\n[166] See especially _Le Tombeor de Notre Dame_ (_Romania_, ii. 315).\r\nNovati (_Rom._ xxv. 591) refers to a passage quoted by Augustine, _de\r\nCiv. Dei_, vi. 10, from the lost work of Seneca, _de Superstitionibus_,\r\n‘doctus archimimus, senex iam decrepitus, cotidie in Capitolio mimum\r\nagebat, quasi dii libenter spectarent quem illi homines desierant.’\r\nSomewhat similar are _Don Cierge qui descendi au Jougleour_ (Gautier de\r\nCoincy), _Miracles de Nostre Dame_ (†1223, ed. Poquet, 1859), and _Le\r\nHarpeor de Roncestre_ (Michel, _Roms., Contes, Dits, Fabl._ ii. 108).\r\n_Saint Pierre et le Jongleur_ (Montaiglon Raynaud, v. 117) is a witty\r\ntale, in which a minstrel, left in charge of hell, loses so many souls\r\nto St. Peter at dice, that no minstrel has been allowed there since. B.\r\nJoannes Bonus (_Acta SS. Oct._ ix. 693) was a minstrel in his youth,\r\nbut the patron saints of the minstrels were always St. Genesius the\r\nmime (cf. p. 10), and St. Julian Hospitator (_Acta SS. Jan._ iii. 589),\r\nwho built a hospital and once entertained an angel unawares.\r\n\r\n[167] Paris, 113; Bédier, 333.\r\n\r\n[168] Brooke, _Eng.

The tenth-century\r\nskald as described in the _Raven-Song_ of Hornklofi at the court of\r\nHarold Fair-hair is very like the _scôp_ (_C. P.

The ‘ianitores et hostiarii,’ when blamed,\r\ndeclared ‘non esse moris regii, alicui menestrallo, palatium intrare\r\nvolenti, in tanta solemnitate aditum denegare’; cf. Walsingham, _Hist.\r\nAngl._ (R.

The _Act of Apparel_ (1463, 3 _Edw. IV_, c. 5)\r\nexcepts minstrels and ‘players in their interludes.’ The Franciscan\r\nstory (p. 57) shows that some of the humbler minstrels went shabby\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n[178] Klein, iii. 635; Du Méril, _Or.

When Francis\r\nhad finished his Canticle of the Sun, he thought for a moment of\r\nsummoning ‘frater Pacificus qui in saeculo vocabatur rex versuum et\r\nfuit valde curialis doctor cantorum,’ and giving him a band of friars\r\nwho might sing it to the people at the end of their sermons: ‘finitis\r\nautem laudibus volebat quod praedicator diceret populo: “Nos sumus\r\nioculatores Domini, et pro his volumus remunerari a vobis, videlicet\r\nut stetis in vera paenitentia.” Et ait: “Quid enim sunt servi Dei nisi\r\nquidam ioculatores eius qui corda hominum erigere debent et movere\r\nad laetitiam spiritualem.”’ Cf. Sabatier, _Life of St. Francis_, 9,\r\n51, 307. Perhaps Francis may have heard of Joachim of Flora, his\r\ncontemporary, who wrote in his _Commentary on the Apocalypse_, f. 183.\r\na. 2 ‘qui vere monachus est nihil reputat esse suum nisi citharam.’\r\n\r\n[187] The MS. of the famous thirteenth-century canon _Sumer is\r\nicumen in_ has religious words written beneath the profane ones;\r\ncf.

The usual Latin term for the Beverley waits is _speculatores_;\r\nbut they are also called _ministralli_, _histriones_ and _mimi_.\r\nApparently waits are intended by the _satrapi_ of the Winchester\r\nAccounts (App. E. (iv)). Elsewhere _histriones_ is the most usual term.\r\nThe signatories to the 1321 statutes of the Paris guild include several\r\n_guètes_ (Bernhard, iii. 402).\r\n\r\n[224] _Household Ordinances_, 48 ‘A Wayte, that nyghtly, from\r\nMighelmasse till Shere-Thursday, pipeth the watche within this courte\r\nfower tymes, and in the somer nyghtes three tymes.’ He is also to\r\nattend the new Knights of the Bath when they keep watch in the chapel\r\nthe night before they are dubbed.\r\n\r\n[225] The Lynn waits had to go through the town from All Saints to\r\nCandlemas. Those of Coventry had similar duties, and in 1467 were\r\nforbidden ‘to pass this Cite but to Abbotts and Priors within x myles\r\nof this Cite.’\r\n\r\n[226] The six minstrels of the Earl of Derby in 1391 had a livery of\r\n‘blod ray cloth and tanne facings’ (Wylie, iv. 160).\r\n\r\n[227] _Household Ordinances_, 48: ‘Mynstrelles, xiii, whereof one is\r\nverger, that directeth them all in festivall dayes to theyre stations,\r\nto bloweings and pipynges, to suche offices as must be warned to\r\nprepare for the king and his houshold at metes and soupers, to be\r\nthe more readie in all servyces; and all these sittinge in the hall\r\ntogyder; whereof sume use trumpettes, sume shalmuse and small pipes,\r\nand sume as strengemen, comyng to this courte at five festes of the\r\nyere, and then to take theyre wages of houshold after iiij^d ob. a\r\nday, if they be present in courte, and then they to avoyde the next\r\nday after the festes be done.

The king’s shawms, if they\r\ncame yearly, got 10_s._, the king’s jugler and the king’s or queen’s\r\nbearward, 6_s._ 8_d._; a duke’s or earl’s trumpeters, if they came six\r\ntogether, also got 6_s._ 8_d._, an earl’s minstrels only 3_s._ 4_d._\r\nIf the troupe came only once in two or three years, and belonged to a\r\n‘speciall Lorde, Friende, or Kynsman’ of the earl, the rate was higher.\r\n\r\n[229] Gautier, ii. 107, from _Bibl. de l’Arsenal MS._ 854; e.g.\r\n‘_Deprecatio pro dono instrioni impendendo_.

The\r\nParis statutes of 1407 (cf. Appendix F) require a licence from the _roi\r\ndes ménestrels_ for such an assembly. A Beauvais _computus_ (1402) has\r\n‘Dati sunt de gratia panes ducenti capitulares mimis in hac civitate de\r\ndiversis partibus pro cantilenis novis addiscendis confluentibus.’\r\n\r\n[232] Hearne, _Appendix ad Lelandi Collectanea_, vi. 36; Percy, 367.\r\nThe proclamation is dated Aug. 6, 9 Edw. II (i. e. 1315).\r\n\r\n[233] No technical term seems, however, intended in _Launfal_ (ed.\r\nRitson), 668:\r\n\r\n    ‘They hadde menstrales of moch honours,\r\n    Fydelers, sytolyrs, and trompours.’\r\n\r\n[234] C.

Whipping is provided for\r\n‘all Fencers Bearewardes Comon Players in Enterludes & Minstrels, not\r\nbelonging to any Baron of this Realme or towards any other honourable\r\npersonage of greater Degree; all Juglers Pedlars Tynkers and Petye\r\nChapmen; whiche said Fencers Bearewardes comon Players in Enterludes\r\nMynstrels Juglers Pedlars Tynkers & Petye Chapmen, shall wander abroade\r\nand have not Lycense of two Justices of the Peace at the leaste,\r\nwhereof one to be of the Quorum, wher and in what Shier they shall\r\nhappen to wander.’ The terms of 39 _Eliz._ c. 4 (1597-8) are very\r\nsimilar, but 1 _Jac. I_, c. 7 (1603-4), took away the exemption for\r\nnoblemen’s servants.\r\n\r\n[236] Appendix F.\r\n\r\n[237] Gautier, ii. 156; Ducange, s.v. _Ministelli_.\r\n\r\n[238] Gautier, ii. 158. Strutt, 195, quotes from _Cott. MS. Nero_, c.\r\nviii a payment of Edw. III ‘ministrallo facienti ministralsiam suam\r\ncoram imagine Beatae Mariae in Veltam, rege praesente.’ Chaucer’s\r\npilgrims had no professional minstrels, but the miller did as well:\r\n\r\n    ‘He was a janglere and a goliardeys, ...\r\n    ... A baggepype wel koude he blowe and sowne,\r\n    And therwithal he broghte us out of towne.’\r\n\r\nIt was in the absence of regular minstrels that the pilgrims fell to\r\ntelling one another stories.\r\n\r\n[239] Gautier, ii. 160. Richard Swinfield, bishop of Hereford, more\r\nthan once rewarded minstrels on his episcopal rounds (J. Webb,\r\n_Household Expenses of Richard de Swinfield_, C. S. i. 152, 155). The\r\nbishops of Durham in 1355, Norwich in 1362, and Winchester in 1374,\r\n1422, and 1481 had ‘minstrels of honour,’ like any secular noble (see\r\nAppendix E, &c.). Even the austere Robert Grosseteste had his private\r\nharper, if we may credit Mannyng, 150:\r\n\r\n    ‘He louede moche to here the  harpe;\r\n    For mannys wyt hyt makyth sharpe.\r\n    Next hys chaumbre, besyde hys stody,\r\n    Hys harpers chaumbre was fast therby.’\r\n\r\nMannyng represents Grosseteste as excusing his predilection by a\r\nreference to King David.\r\n\r\n[240] Madox, _Hist. of Exchequer_, 251.\r\n\r\n[241] _Norfolk Archaeology_, xi. 339 (Norwich); Hazlitt-Warton, ii. 97;\r\nKennet, _Parochial Antiq._ ii. 259 (Bicester); _Decem Scriptores_, 2011\r\n(Canterbury); for the rest cf. Appendix E.\r\n\r\n[242] Hazlitt-Warton, ii. 97; iii. 118, quotes from the _Register_\r\nof St. Swithin’s amongst the _Wolvesey MSS._; in 1338 ‘cantabat\r\nioculator quidam nomine Herebertus canticum Colbrondi, necdum gestum\r\nEmmae reginae a iudicio ignis liberatae, in aula prioris’: in 1374\r\n‘In festo Alwynis episcopi ... in aula conventus sex ministralli, cum\r\nquatuor citharisatoribus, faciebant ministralcias suas. Et post cenam,\r\nin magna camera arcuata domini Prioris, cantabant idem gestum....\r\nVeniebant autem dicti ioculatores a castello domini regis et ex\r\nfamilia episcopi.’ The ‘canticum Colbrondi’ was doubtless a romance\r\nof Guy of Warwick, of which Winchester is the locality. Fragments of\r\nearly fourteenth-century English versions exist (Ten Brink, i. 246;\r\nJusserand, _E. L._ i. 224; Zupitza, _Guy of Warwick_, E. E. T. S.; G.\r\nL. Morrill, _Speculum Gy de Warewyke_, E. E. T. S. lxxxi).\r\n\r\n[243] Bartholomaeus (Albizzi) de Pisis (1385-99), _Liber Conformitatum_\r\n(ed. 1590, i. 94^b); Antoninus Episc.

S.), ii. 349.\r\n\r\n[244] See Appendix E. At Paris the _Statutes_ of Cornouaille College\r\n(1380) required abstinence from ‘ludis mimorum, ioculatorum,\r\nhistrionum, goliardorum, et consimilium.’ Bulaeus, v. 782, gives\r\nanother Paris regulation allowing ‘mimi, ad summum duo’ on Twelfth\r\nNight (Rashdall, ii. 674).\r\n\r\n[245] Thomas Aquinas, _Summa Theologiae_ (†1274), ii. 2, quaest. 168,\r\nart. 3 ‘Sicut dictum est, ludus est necessarius ad conversationem\r\nvitae humanae. ad omnia autem, quae sunt utilia conversationi humanae,\r\ndeputari possunt aliqua officia licita. et ideo etiam officium\r\nhistrionum, quod ordinatur ad solatium hominibus exhibendum, non est\r\nsecundum se illicitum, nec sunt in statu peccati: dummodo moderate ludo\r\nutantur, id est, non utendo aliquibus illicitis verbis vel factis ad\r\nludum, et non adhibendo ludum negotiis et temporibus indebitis ... unde\r\nilli, qui moderate iis subveniunt, non peccant, sed iusta faciunt,\r\nmercedem ministerii eorum iis attribuendo. si qui autem superflue sua\r\nin tales consumunt, vel etiam sustentant illos histriones qui illicitis\r\nludis utuntur, peccant, quasi eos in peccatis foventes. unde Augustinus\r\ndicit, _super Ioan._ quod _donare res suas histrionibus vitium est\r\nimmane_,’ &c., &c.\r\n\r\n[246] Cf. Appendix G.\r\n\r\n[247] Another version of this story is given by Petrus Cantor (ob.\r\n1197), _Verbum Abbreviatum_, c. 84 (_P. L._ ccv. 254) ‘Ioculatori\r\ncuidam papa Alexander (Alex. III) nec concessit vivere de officio\r\nsuo, nec ei penitus interdixit.’ In c. 49 of the same work Petrus\r\nCantor inveighs learnedly _Contra dantes histrionibus_. Doubtless the\r\nAlexander in question is Alexander III (1159-81), though the (Alex.\r\nIII) above may be due to the seventeenth-century editor, Galopinus. A\r\nhasty glance at the voluminous and practically unindexed decrees and\r\nletters of Alexander III in _P. L._ cc. and Jaffé, _Regesta Pontificum\r\nRomanorum_ (ed. 2, 1885-8), ii. 145-418, has not revealed the source\r\nof the story; and I doubt whether the Pope’s decision, if it was ever\r\ngiven, is to be found in black and white. The two reports of it by\r\nThomas de Cabham and Petrus Cantor are barely consistent. In any case,\r\nit never got into the Gregorian Decretals.\r\n\r\n[248] Gautier, ii. 42; Bédier, 389; Ten Brink, i. 186; Ducange, s.\r\nvv. _Golia_, &c.; O. Hubatsch, _Lat. Vagantenlieder des Mittelalters_\r\n(1870).\r\n\r\n[249] _Le Département des Livres_ (Méon, _N. R._ i. 404):\r\n\r\n    ‘A Bouvines delez Dinant\r\n    Li perdi-je Ovide le grant ...\r\n    Mon Lucan et mon Juvenal\r\n    Oubliai-je a Bonival,\r\n    Eustace le grant et Virgile\r\n    Perdi aus dez a Abeville.’\r\n\r\n[250] The chief collections of goliardic verse are Schmeller, _Carmina\r\nBurana_ (ed. 3, 1894), and T. Wright, _Latin Poems attributed to Walter\r\nMapes_ (C. S. 1841): for others cf. Hubatsch, 16. Latin was not unknown\r\namongst lay minstrels: cf. _Deus Bordeors Ribauz_ (Montaiglon-Raynaud,\r\ni. 3):\r\n\r\n    ‘Mais ge sai aussi bien conter,\r\n    Et en roumanz et en latin.’\r\n\r\n[251] Hubatsch, 15. The origin, precise meaning, and mutual relations\r\nof the terms _Golias_, _goliardi_ are uncertain. Probably the goliardic\r\nliterature arose in France, rather than in England with Walter Mapes,\r\nthe attribution to whom of many of the poems is perhaps due to a\r\nconfusion of G[olias] with G[ualterus] in the MSS. Giraldus Cambrensis\r\n(ob. 1217), _Speculum Ecclesiae_, says ‘Parasitus quidam Golias nomine\r\nnostris diebus gulositate pariter et leccacitate famosissimus ... in\r\npapam et curiam Romanam carmina famosa ... evomuit’: but the following\r\nnote points to a much earlier origin for Golias and his _pueri_, and\r\nthis is upheld by W. Scherer, _Gesch. d. deutsch. Dichtung im 11. und\r\n12. Jahrh. 16._\r\n\r\n[252] Early decrees forbidding the clergy to be _ioculatores_ are\r\ngiven on p. 39. More precise is the order of Gautier of Sens (†913)\r\nin his _Constitutiones_, c. 13 (Mansi, xviii. 324) ‘Statuimus quod\r\nclerici ribaldi, maxime qui dicuntur de familia Goliae, per episcopos,\r\narchidiaconos, officiales, et decanos Christianitatis, tonderi\r\npraecipiantur vel etiam radi, ita quod eis non remaneat tonsura\r\nclericalis: ita tamen quod sine periculo et scandalo ita fiant.’ If\r\nMansi’s date is right, this precedes by three centuries the almost\r\nidentical _Conc. of Rouen_, c. 8 (Mansi, xxiii. 215), and _Conc. of\r\nCastle Gonther_ (Tours), c. 21 (Mansi, xxiii. 237), both in 1231.\r\nGautier, _Les Tropaires_, i. 186, dwells on the influence of the\r\n_goliardi_ on the late and ribald development of the tropes, and\r\nquotes _Conc. of Treves_ (1227), c. 9 (Mansi, xxiii. 33) ‘praecipimus\r\nut omnes sacerdotes non permittant trutannos et alios vagos scholares\r\naut goliardos cantare versus super _Sanctus_ et _Agnus Dei_.’ On their\r\nprobable share in the Feast of Fools cf. ch. xiv. For later legislation\r\ncf. Hubatsch, 14, 95, and the passage from the _Liber Sextus_ of\r\nBoniface VIII on p. 39. It lasts to the _Conc. Frisingense_ (1440)\r\n‘statuimus ne clerici mimis, ioculatoribus, histrionibus, buffonibus,\r\ngalliardis, largiantur’ (Labbe, xiii. 1286). By this time ‘goliard’\r\nseems little more than a synonym for ‘minstrel.’ The ‘mynstralle, a\r\ngulardous,’ of Mannyng, 148, does not appear to be a clerk, while\r\nChaucer’s ‘goliardeys’ is the Miller (_C. T._ prol. 560). On the other\r\nhand, Langland’s ‘Goliardeys, a glotoun of wordes’ (_Piers Plowman_,\r\nprol. 139), speaks Latin. Another name for the _goliardi_ occurs in\r\nan _Epistola Guidonis S. Laurentii in Lucina Cardinalis_, xx. (1266,\r\nHartzheim, iii. 807) against ‘vagi scolares, qui Eberdini vocantur,’\r\nand who ‘divinum invertunt officium, unde laici scandalizantur.’\r\n\r\n[253] Baudouin de Condé in his _Contes des Hiraus_ contrasts the ‘grans\r\nmenestreus,’ the\r\n\r\n    ‘Maistres de sa menestrandie,\r\n    Qui bien viele ou ki bien die\r\n    De bouce’\r\n\r\nwith the ‘felons et honteux,’ who win pence,\r\n\r\n            ‘l’un por faire l’ivre,\r\n    L’autre le cat, le tiers le sot,’\r\n\r\nwhile in _Les États du Monde_ his son Jean sets up a high standard of\r\nbehaviour for the true minstrels:\r\n\r\n    ‘Soies de cuer nes et polis,\r\n    Courtois, envoisiés, et jolis,\r\n    Pour les boinnes gens solacier’\r\n\r\n(Scheler, _Dits et Contes de Baudouin de Condé et de son fils Jean\r\nde Condé_, i. 154; ii. 377). Cf. Watriquet de Couvin, _Dis du fol\r\nmenestrel_ (ed. Scheler, 367):\r\n\r\n    ‘Menestriex se doit maintenir\r\n    Plus simplement c’une pucele, ...\r\n    Menestrel qui veut son droit faire\r\n    Ne doit le jangleur contrefaire,\r\n    Mais en sa bouche avoir tous dis\r\n    Douces paroles et biaus dis,\r\n    Estre nés, vivre purement.’\r\n\r\nThese three writers belong to the end of the thirteenth and the\r\nbeginning of the fourteenth century.\r\n\r\n[254] A.

Paris, 182: A. Stimming in Grober’s _Grundriss_,\r\nii. 2. 15; Gautier, ii. 45, 58. The commonest of phrases in troubadour\r\nbiography is ‘cantet et trobet.’ The term _trobador_ is properly the\r\naccusative case of _trobaire_.\r\n\r\n[258] Petrarch, _Epist. Rerum Senil._ n. 3 ‘sunt homines non magni\r\ningenii, magnae vero memoriae, magnaeque diligentiae, sed maioris\r\naudaciae, qui regum ac potentum aulas frequentant, de proprio\r\nnudi, vestiti autem carminibus alienis, dumque quid ab hoc, aut ab\r\nillo exquisitius materno praesertim charactere dictum sit, ingenti\r\nexpressione pronunciant, gratiam sibi nobilium, et pecunias quaerunt,\r\net vestes et munera.’ Fulke of Marseilles, afterwards bishop of\r\nToulouse, wrote songs in his youth. He became an austere Cistercian;\r\nbut the songs had got abroad, and whenever he heard one of them sung\r\nby a _joglar_, he would eat only bread and water (_Sermo_ of Robert de\r\nSorbonne in Hauréau, _Man. Fr._ xxiv. 2. 286).\r\n\r\n[259] In the first edition of his _Reliques_ (1765), Percy gave the\r\nmediaeval minstrel as high a status as the Norse _scald_ or Anglo-Saxon\r\n_scôp_. This led to an acrid criticism by Ritson who, in his essay\r\n_On the ancient English Minstrels_ in _Ancient Songs and Ballads_\r\n(1829), easily showed the low repute in which many minstrels were\r\nheld. See also his elaborate _Dissertation on Romance and Minstrelsy_\r\nin his _Ancient English Metrical Romances_ (1802). The truth really\r\nlay between the two, for neither appreciated the wide variety covered\r\nby a common name. On the controversy, cf. Minto in _Enc. Brit._ s. v.\r\n_Minstrels_, Courthope, i. 426-31, and H. B. Wheatley’s Introduction to\r\nhis edition of Percy’s _Reliques_, xiii-xv. Percy in his later editions\r\nprofited largely by Ritson’s criticism; a careful collation of these is\r\ngiven in Schroer’s edition (1889).\r\n\r\n[260] Magnin, _Journal des Savants_ (1846), 545.\r\n\r\n[261] Lambertus Ardensis, _Chronicon_, c. 81 (ed.

A letter to Wolsey of July 6, 1527, from\r\nR. Croke, the tutor of Henry VIII’s natural son, the Duke of\r\nRichmond, complains of difficulties put in his way by R. Cotton, the\r\nClerk-comptroller of the duke’s household, and adds: ‘At hic tamen in\r\npraeceptore arcendo diligens, libenter patitur scurras et mimos (qui\r\ndigna lupanari in sacro cubiculo coram principe cantillent) admitti’\r\n(Nichols, _Memoir of Henry Fitzroy_ in _Camden Miscellany_, iii.\r\nxxxviii).\r\n\r\n[268] For the _ioculator regis_, cf. Appendix E, and Leach, _Beverley\r\nMSS._ 179. He is called ‘jugler’ in _N. H. B._ 67. Is he distinct\r\nfrom the royal _gestator_ (_gestour_, _jester_)? Both appear in the\r\nShrewsbury accounts (s. ann. 1521, 1549). In 1554 both _le jugler_ and\r\n_le gester_ were entertained. The _gestator_ seems to have merged in\r\nthe _stultus_ or court fool (ch. xvi). The accounts in App. E often\r\nmention the royal bearward, who remained an important official under\r\nElizabeth.\r\n\r\n[269] 2 _Hen. IV_, ii. 4. 12.\r\n\r\n[270] Cf.

Arber), 46 ‘Certainly I must\r\nconfess my own barbarousness. I never heard the old song of _Percy and\r\nDouglas_, that I found not my heart moved more than with a trumpet. And\r\nyet is it sung but by some blind Crowder, with no rougher voice than\r\nrude style.’ For the Puritan view, see Stubbes, i. 169.\r\n\r\n[273] Ritson, ccxxiv, quotes the following lines, ascribed to Dr. Bull\r\n(†1597), from a _Harl. MS._, as the epitaph of minstrelsy:\r\n\r\n    ‘When Jesus went to Jairus’ house\r\n      (Whose daughter was about to dye),\r\n    He turned the minstrels out of doors,\r\n      Among the rascal company:\r\n    Beggars they are, with one consent,\r\n    And rogues, by Act of Parliament.’\r\n\r\n[274] _Du Vilain au Buffet_ (Montaiglon-Raynaud, iii. 202):\r\n\r\n    ‘Li quens manda les menestrels,\r\n    Et si a fet crier entr’els\r\n    Qui la meillor truffe sauroit\r\n    Dire ne fere, qu’il auroit\r\n    Sa robe d’escarlate nueve.\r\n    L’uns menestrels a l’autre rueve\r\n    Fere son mestier, tel qu’il sot,\r\n    L’uns fet l’ivre, l’autre le sot;\r\n    Li uns chante, li autres note,\r\n    Et li autres dit la riote,\r\n    Et li autres la jenglerie;\r\n    Cil qui sevent de jouglerie\r\n    Vielent par devant le conte;\r\n    Aucuns i a qui fabliaus conte,\r\n    Où il ot mainte gaberie,\r\n    Et li autres dit l’_Erberie_,\r\n    Là où il ot mainte risée.’\r\n\r\nCf. p. 67; also the similar list in Wace, _Brut_, 10823, and _Piers\r\nPlowman_, Passus xvi. 205:\r\n\r\n    ‘Ich can nat tabre ne trompe · ne telle faire gestes,\r\n    Farten, ne fithelen · at festes, ne harpen,\r\n    Iapen ne iogelen · ne gentelliche pipe,\r\n    Nother sailen ne sautrien · ne singe with the giterne.’\r\n\r\n[275] Gautier, ii. 63; Strutt, 207.

The Paris MS. (_B. N._ f. fr. 2168) of _Aucassin\r\net Nicolete_ preserves the musical notation of the verse sections. Only\r\nthree musical phrases, with very slight variations, are used. Two of\r\nthese were probably repeated, alternately or at the singer’s fancy,\r\nthroughout the tirade; the third provided a cadence for the closing\r\nline (Bourdillon, _Aucassin et Nicolette_ (1897), 157).\r\n\r\n[294] Chaucer, _House of Fame_, 1197:\r\n\r\n    ‘Of alle maner of minstrales,\r\n    And gestiours, that tellen tales,\r\n    Bothe of weping and of game.’\r\n\r\nCf. _Sir Thopas_, 134; and Gower, _Confessio Amantis_, vii. 2424:\r\n\r\n    ‘And every menstral hadde pleid,\r\n    And every disour hadde seid.’\r\n\r\nThe evidence of Erasmus is late, of course, for the hey-day of\r\nminstrelsy, but in his time there were certainly English minstrels\r\nwho merely recited, without musical accompaniment; cf. _Ecclesiastes_\r\n(_Opera_, v. col. 958) ‘Apud Anglos est simile genus hominum, quales\r\napud Italos sunt circulatores, de quibus modo dictum est; qui irrumpunt\r\nin convivia magnatum, aut in cauponas vinarias; et argumentum aliquod,\r\nquod edidicerunt, recitant; puta mortem omnibus dominari, aut\r\nlaudem matrimonii. Sed quoniam ea lingua monosyllabis fere constat,\r\nquemadmodum Germanica; atque illi studio vitant cantum, nobis latrare\r\nvidentur verius quam loqui.’\r\n\r\n[295] Ten Brink, i. 193, 225, 235, old gleeman tradition was probably\r\nless interfered with in the lowlands of Scotland than in England\r\nproper; cf. Henderson, _Scottish Vernacular Literature_, 16.\r\n\r\n[296] Ten Brink, i. 322; Jusserand, i. 360; Courthope, i. 197. Minot’s\r\npoems have been edited by J. Hall (Oxford, 1887). See also Wright,\r\n_Political Songs_ (C.S.) and _Political Poems and Songs_ (R.S.). Many\r\nof these, however, are Latin.\r\n\r\n[297] On Welsh bardism see H. d’Arbois de Jubainville, _Intr. à l’Étude\r\nde la Litt. celtique_, 63; Stephens, _Literature of the Kymry_, 84,\r\n93, 97, 102; Ernest David, _Études historiques sur la Poésie et la\r\nMusique dans la Cambrie_, 13, 62-103, 147-64. In Wales, an isolated\r\ncorner of Europe, little touched by Latin influences, the bards long\r\nretained the social and national position which it is probable they\r\nonce had held in all the Aryan peoples. Their status is defined in the\r\nlaws of Howel Dha (†920) and in those of Gruffyd ab Cynan (1100). The\r\nlatter code distinguishes three orders of bards proper, the _Pryddyd_\r\nor Chair bards, the _Teuluwr_ or Palace bards, and the _Arwyddfardd_\r\nor heralds, also called _Storiawr_, the _cantores historici_ of\r\nGiraldus Cambrensis. The _Pryddyd_ and _Teuluwr_ differ precisely as\r\npoets and executants, _trouvères_ and _jougleurs_. Below all these\r\ncome the _Clerwr_, against whom official bardism from the sixth to\r\nthe thirteenth century showed an inveterate animosity. These are an\r\nunattached wandering folk, players on flutes, tambourines, and other\r\ninstruments meaner than the _telyn_ or harp, and the _crwth_ or viol\r\nwhich alone the bards proper deigned to use. Many of them had also\r\npicked up the mime-tricks of the foreigners. It was probably with these\r\n_Clerwr_ that the English and French neighbours of the Kelts came\r\nmainly into contact. Padelford, 5, puts this contact as early as the\r\nAnglo-Saxon period.\r\n\r\n[298] Giraldus Cambrensis, _Descriptio Cambriae_, i. 17 ‘famosus ille\r\nfabulator Bledhericus, qui tempora nostra paulo praevenit.’ Thomas,\r\n_Tristan_ (†1170, ed.

A _fabliau_ is properly a ‘conte à rire\r\nen vers’; the term _dit_ is applied more generally to a number of short\r\npoems which deal, ‘souvent avec agrément, des sujets empruntés à la vie\r\nquotidienne.’ Some _dits_ are satirical, others eulogistic of a class\r\nor profession, others descriptive. But the distinction is not very well\r\ndefined, and the _fabliaux_ are often called _dits_ in the MSS.\r\n\r\n[305] Montaiglon-Raynaud, i. 1; ii. 257. The _dit_ is also called _La\r\nJengle au Ribaut et la Contrejengle_.\r\n\r\n[306] Rutebeuf (ed. Kressner), 99.\r\n\r\n[307] Barbazan-Méon, i. 356. Bédier, 33, considers _Courtois d’Arras_\r\nas the oldest French comedy, a _jeu dramatique_ with intercalated\r\nnarrative by a _meneur de jeu_. But the fact that it ends with the\r\nwords _Te Deum_ leads one to look upon it as an adaptation of a\r\nreligious play; cf. ch. xix.\r\n\r\n[308] On the _débats_ in general, see _Hist.

Paris, _Litt. fr._ 158.\r\n\r\n[309] Ten Brink, i. 215; Hubatsch, 24; Gummere, _B. P._ 200, 306.\r\nThe _Débat de l’Yver et de l’Esté_ has the nearest folk-lore origin;\r\ncf. ch. ix. Paris, _Origines_, 28, mentions several Greek and Latin\r\nversions beginning with Aesop (Halm, 414). The most important is the\r\nninth-century _Conflictus Veris et Hiemis_ (Riese, _Anth. Lat._ i. 2.\r\n145), variously ascribed to Bede (Wernsdorff, _Poetae Latini Minores_,\r\nii. 239), Alcuin (_Alc. Opera_, ed. Froben, ii. 612) and others. French\r\nversions are printed in Montaiglon-Rothschild, _Anc. Poés. fr._ vi.\r\n190, x. 41, and Jubinal, _N. R._ ii. 40. There are imitations in all\r\ntongues: cf. M. Émile Picot’s note in Mont.-Rothsch. _op. cit._ x. 49;\r\n_Hist. Litt._ xxiii. 231; Douhet, 1441.--_La Disputoison du Vin et de\r\nl’Iaue_ is printed in Jubinal, _N. R._ i. 293; Wright, _Lat. Poems of\r\nWalter Mapes_, 299; _Carmina Burana_, 232. It is based on the _Goliae\r\nDialogus inter Aquam et Vinum_ (Wright, _loc. cit._ 87); cf. _Hist.\r\nLitt._ xxiii. 228; _Romania_, xvi. 366.--On the complicated history\r\nof the _Débat du Corps et de l’Âme_, see T. Batiouchkof in _Romania_,\r\nxx. 1. 513; G. Kleinert, _Ueber den Streit von Leib und Seele_; _Hist.\r\nLitt._ xxii. 162; P. de Julleville, _Répertoire Comique_, 5, 300, 347;\r\nWright, _Latin Poems_, xxiii. 95, 321. Latin, French and other versions\r\nare given by Wright, and by Viollet-Leduc, _Anc. Thé. fr._ iii.\r\n325.--_Phillis et Flora_, or _De Phyllis qui aime un chevalier et de\r\nFlora qui aime un prêtre_, is also referred by Paris, _Orig._ 28, to a\r\nfolk-song beginning; cf. _H. L._ xxii. 138, 165; _Romania_, xxii. 536.\r\nLatin versions are in _Carmina Burana_, 155; Wright, _Latin Poems of\r\nW. Mapes_, 258.--A possible influence of the Theocritean and Virgilian\r\neclogues upon these _débats_, through their neo-Latin forms, must be\r\nborne in mind.\r\n\r\n[310] Wülker, 384; Brooke, i. 139, ii. 93, 221, 268; Jusserand, i. 75,\r\n443. The passages of dialogue dwelt on by these writers mostly belong\r\nto the work of Cynewulf and his school. It has been suggested that\r\nsome of them, e.g. the A.-S. _Descent into Hell_ (Grein, iii. 175;\r\ncf. _Anglia_, xix. 137), or the dialogue between Mary and Joseph in\r\nCynewulf’s _Christ_, 163 (ed. Gollancz, p. 16), may have been intended\r\nfor liturgical use by half-choirs; but of this there is really no\r\nproof. Wülker, _loc. cit._, shows clearly that the notion of a dramatic\r\nrepresentation was unfamiliar to the Anglo-Saxons.\r\n\r\n[311] Ten Brink, i. 312. Several English versions of the _Debate\r\nbetween Body and Soul_ are given by Wright, _loc. cit._ 334. An English\r\n_Debate and Stryfe betwene Somer and Wynter_ is in W. C. Hazlitt,\r\n_Early Popular Poetry_, iii. 29.\r\n\r\n[312] Cf. ch. xx.\r\n\r\n[313] Ten Brink, i. 214, 309. _The Owl and the Nightingale_ (c.\r\n1216-72), was printed by J. Stevenson (Roxburghe Club); _the Thrush and\r\nthe Nightingale_ and _the Fox and the Wolf_, by W. C. Hazlitt, _Early\r\nPopular Poetry_, i. 50, 58. There are also a _Debate of the Carpenter’s\r\nTools_ (Hazlitt, i. 79) and an English version of a Latin _Disputacio\r\ninter Mariam et Crucem_ (R. Morris, _Legends of the Holy Rood_, 131);\r\ncf. Ten Brink, i. 259, 312. An A.-S. version of the _Debate between\r\nBody and Soul_ is in the _Exeter Book_ (Grein, ii. 92).\r\n\r\n[314] Ælred (†1166), _Speculum Charitatis_, ii. 23 (_P. L._ cxcv.\r\n571) ‘Videas aliquando hominem aperto ore quasi intercluso halitu\r\nexpirare, non cantare, ac ridiculosa quadam vocis interceptione quasi\r\nminitari silentium; nunc agones morientium, vel extasim patientium\r\nimitari. Interim histrionicis quibusdam gestibus totum corpus agitatur,\r\ntorquentur labia, rotant, ludunt humeri; et ad singulas quasque\r\nnotas digitorum flexus respondet. Et haec ridiculosa dissolutio\r\nvocatur religio!... Vulgus ... miratur ... sed lascivas cantantium\r\ngesticulationes, meretricias vocum alternationes et infractiones,\r\nnon sine cachinno risuque intuetur, ut eos non ad oratorium sed ad\r\ntheatrum, non ad orandum, sed ad spectandum aestimes convenisse.’ Cf.\r\n_op. cit._ ii. 17 ‘Cum enim in tragediis vanisve carminibus quisquam\r\niniuriatus fingitur, vel oppressus ... si quis haec, vel cum canuntur\r\naudiens, vel cernens si recitentur ... moveatur’; and Johannes de\r\nJanua, s.v. _persona_ (cited Creizenach, i. 381) ‘Item persona dicitur\r\nhistrio, repraesentator comoediarum, qui diversis modis personat\r\ndiversas repraesentando personas.’ All these passages, like the\r\nninth-century _responsio_ of arch-bishop Leidradus referred to on p.\r\n36, may be suspected of learning rather than actuality. As for the\r\nepitaph of the mime Vitalis (Riese, _Anth. Lat._ i. 2. 143; Baehrens,\r\n_P. L. M._ iii. 245), sometimes quoted in this connexion, it appears\r\nto be classical and not mediaeval at all; cf. Teuffel-Schwabe, §§ 8.\r\n11; 32. 6. Probably this is also the case with the lines _De Mimo iam\r\nSene_ in Wright, _Anecdota Literaria_, 100, where again ‘theatra’ are\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n[315] Cf. p. 71. The mention of a ‘Disare that played the sheppart’ at\r\nthe English court in 1502 (Nicolas, _Privy Purse Expenses of Elizabeth\r\nof York_) is too late to be of importance here.\r\n\r\n[316] Creizenach, i. 383, citing at second-hand from fourteenth-century\r\naccounts of a Savoy treasurer ‘rappresentando i costumi delle compagnie\r\ninglesi e bretoni.’\r\n\r\n[317] Creizenach, i. 380.\r\n\r\n[318] Thomas de Cabham mentions the _horribiles larvae_ of some\r\nminstrels. A. Lecoy de la Marche, _La Chaire française_ (ed. 2,\r\n1886), 444, quotes a sermon of Étienne de Bourbon in _MS. B. N. Lat._\r\n15970, f. 352 ‘ad similitudinem illorum ioculatorum qui ferunt facies\r\ndepictas quae dicuntur artificia gallicè, cum quibus ludunt et homines\r\ndeludunt.’ Cf. Liudprand, iii. 15 (Pertz, iii. 310) ‘histrionum\r\nmimorumve more incedere, qui, ut ad risum facile turbas illiciant,\r\nvariis sese depingunt coloribus.’ The _monstra larvarum_, however, of\r\nvarious ecclesiastical prohibitions I take to refer specifically to the\r\nFeast of Fools (cf. ch. xiii).\r\n\r\n[319] Schack, _Gesch. der dram. Litt. und Kunst in Spanien_, i. 30,\r\nquotes a Carolingian capitulary, from Heineccius, _Capit._ lib. v.\r\nc. 388 ‘si quis ex scenicis vestem sacerdotalem aut monasticam vel\r\nmulieris religiosae vel qualicunque ecclesiastico statu similem indutus\r\nfuerit, corporali poena subsistat et exilio tradatur.’ This prohibition\r\nis as old as the _Codex Theodosianus_; cf. p. 14.\r\n\r\n[320] _Œuvres_ de Rutebeuf (ed. Kressner), 115; cf. _Romania_, xvi.\r\n496; Julleville, _Les Com._ 24; _Rép. Com._ 407.\r\n\r\n[321] Creizenach, i. 386, further points out that a stage was not\r\nindispensable to the Latin _mimus_, who habitually played before the\r\ncurtain and probably with very little setting; that the favourite\r\nsituations of fifteenth-century French farce closely resemble those of\r\nthe mimes; and that the use of marionettes is a proof of some knowledge\r\nof dramatic methods amongst the minstrels.\r\n\r\n[322] On this treatise, cf. ch. xx.\r\n\r\n[323] A ‘japer’ is often an idle talker, like a ‘jangler’ which is\r\nclearly sometimes confused with a ‘jongleur’; cf. Chaucer, _Parson’s\r\nTale_, 89 ‘He is a japere and a gabber and no verray repentant\r\nthat eft-soone dooth thing for which hym oghte repente.’ Langland\r\nuses the term in a more technical sense. _Activa Vita_ in _Piers\r\nPlowman_, xvi. 207, is no minstrel, because ‘Ich can not ... japen\r\nne jogelen.’ No doubt a ‘jape’ would include a _fabliau_. It is\r\nequivalent etymologically to ‘gab,’ and Bédier, 33, points out that\r\nthe _jougleurs_ use _gabet_, as well as _bourde_, _trufe_, and _risée_\r\nfor a _fabliau_.--The use of ‘pleye’ as ‘jest’ may be illustrated by\r\nChaucer, _Pardoner’s Tale_ (_C. T._ 12712) ‘My wit is greet, though\r\nthat I bourde and pleye.’--The ‘japis’ of the _Tretise_ are probably\r\nthe ‘knakkes’ of the passage on ‘japeris’ in _Parson’s Tale_, 651\r\n‘right so conforten the vileyns wordes and knakkes of japeris hem that\r\ntravaillen in the service of the devel.’\r\n\r\n[324] Montaiglon-Raynaud, ii. 243. Cf. _Hist. Litt._ xxiii. 103;\r\nJusserand, _Lit. Hist._ i. 442. A shorter prose form of the story\r\nis found in _La Riote du Monde_ (ed. Fr. Michel, 1834), a popular\r\n_facétie_ of which both French and Anglo-Norman versions exist; cf.\r\nParis, _Litt. fr._ 153. And a Latin form, _De Mimo et Rege Francorum_\r\nis in Wright, _Latin Stories_, No. 137. The point consists in the\r\nquibbling replies with which the _jougleur_ meets the king’s questions.\r\nThus, in _La Riote du Monde_: ‘Dont ies tu?--Je suis de no vile.--U est\r\nte vile?--Entor le moustier.--U est li moustiers?--En l’atre.--U est li\r\natres?--Sor terre.--U siet cele terre?--Sor l’iaue.--Comment apiel-on\r\nl’iaue?--On ne l’apiele nient; ele vient bien sans apieler.’\r\n\r\n[325] Cf. Appendix V.\r\n\r\n[326] Cf. ch. viii.\r\n\r\n[327] Ed. P. Meyer, in _Jahrbuch für romanische und englische\r\nLiteratur_, vi. 163. The piece was probably written in Flanders,\r\nbetween 1266 and 1290. Cf. Creizenach, i. 398.\r\n\r\n[328] See Appendix U. References for the earlier non-dramatic versions\r\nin Latin, French, and English of the story are given by Jusserand,\r\n_Lit. Hist._ i. 447. A Cornish dramatic fragment of the fourteenth\r\ncentury is printed in the _Athenæum_ for Dec. 1, 1877, and _Revue\r\nceltique_, iv. 259; cf. Creizenach, i. 401.\r\n\r\n[329] Stephens-Hunt, ii. 301; F. S. Stevenson, _Robert Grosseteste_,\r\n126. The disciplinary attack seems to have begun with Grosseteste’s\r\npredecessor, Hugh de Wells, in 1230 (Wilkins, i. 627), but he, like\r\nRoger Weseham, bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, in 1252 (_Annales\r\nMonastici_, R. S. i. 296), merely condemns _ludi_, a term which may\r\nmean folk-festivals or minstrelsy, or both. A similar ambiguity\r\nattaches to the obligation of the anchoresses of Tarrant Keyneston not\r\nto look on at a _ludus_ (_pleouwe_) in the church-yard (_Ancren Riwle_,\r\nC. S. 318).\r\n\r\n[330] In 1236 Grosseteste wrote to his archdeacons forbidding ‘arietum\r\nsuper ligna et rotas elevationes, caeterosque ludos consimiles,\r\nin quo decertatur pro bravio; cum huiusmodi ludorum tam actores\r\nquam spectatores, sicut evidenter demonstrat Isidorus, immolant\r\ndaemonibus, ... et cum etiam huiusmodi ludi frequenter dant occasiones\r\nirae, odii, pugnae, et homicidii.’ His _Constitutiones_ of 1238 say\r\n‘Praecipimus etiam ut in singulis ecclesiis denuncietur solenniter\r\nne quisquam levet arietes super rotas, vel alios ludos statuat, in\r\nquibus decertatur pro bravio: nec huiusmodi ludis quisquam intersit,\r\n&c.’ About 1244 he wrote again to the archdeacons: ‘Faciunt etiam, ut\r\naudivimus, clerici ludos quos vocant miracula: et alios ludos quos\r\nvocant Inductionem Maii sive Autumni; et laici scotales ... miracula\r\netiam et ludos supra nominatos et scotales, quod est in vestra\r\npotestate facili, omnino exterminetis’ (Luard, _Letters of Robert\r\nGrosseteste_ (R. S.) _Epp._ xxii, lii, cvii, pp. 74, 162, 317). For his\r\ncondemnations of the Feast of Fools cf. ch. xiv.\r\n\r\n[331] _Const. Walt. de Cantilupo_ (Wilkins, i. 673) ‘prohibemus\r\nclericis ... nec sustineant ludos fieri de Rege et Regina, nec arietas\r\nlevari, nec palaestras publicas fieri, nec gildales inhonestas.’ The\r\nclergy must also abstain and dissuade the laity from ‘compotationibus\r\nquae vocantur scottales’ (Wilkins, i. 672). On ‘ram-raisings,’ &c., cf.\r\nch. vii; on ‘gildales’ and ‘scotales’ ch. viii.\r\n\r\n[332] Surely the reference is to the mock kings and queens of the\r\nvillage festivals, and not, as Guy, 521; Jusserand, _Litt. Hist._ i.\r\n444, suggest, to the question-and-answer game of _Le Roi qui ne ment_\r\ndescribed in Jean de Condé’s _Sentier Batu_ (Montaiglon-Raynaud,\r\niii. 248), although this is called playing ‘as rois et as reines’ in\r\nAdan de la Hale’s _Robin et Marion_ (ed. Monmerqué-Michel, 121) and\r\nelsewhere (cf. Guy, 222), and possibly grew out of the festival custom.\r\nYet another game of _King and Queen_, of the practical joke order, is\r\ndescribed as played at Golspie by Nicholson, 119.\r\n\r\n[333] Wilkins, i. 666.\r\n\r\n[334] Anstey, _Munimenta Academica_ (R. S.), i. 18 ‘ne quis choreas\r\ncum larvis seu strepitu aliquo in ecclesiis vel plateis ducat, vel\r\nsertatus, vel coronatus corona ex foliis arborum, vel florum vel\r\naliunde composita alicubi incedat ... prohibemus.’\r\n\r\n[335] _Inquisitiones ... de vita et conversatione clericorum et\r\nlaicorum_ in _Annales de Burton_ (_Ann. Monast._ R. S. i. 307) ‘an\r\naliqui laici mercata, vel ludos, seu placita peculiaria fieri faciant\r\nin locis sacris, et an haec fuerint prohibita ex parte episcopi....\r\nAn aliqui laici elevaverint arietes, vel fieri faciant schothales,\r\nvel decertaverint de praeeundo cum vexillis in visitatione matricis\r\necclesiae.’\r\n\r\n[336] Wilkins, ii. 129 ‘c. 13 ... Ne quisquam luctas, choreas, vel\r\nalios ludos inhonestos in coemeteriis exercere praesumat; praecipue\r\nin vigiliis et festis sanctorum, cum huiusmodi ludos theatrales et\r\nludibriorium spectacula introductos per quos ecclesiarum coinquinatur\r\nhonestas, sacri ordines detestantur.’\r\n\r\n[337] Wilkins, iii. 68 ‘c. 2 ... nec in ipsis [locis sacris] fiant\r\nluctationes, sagittationes, vel ludi.’ A special caution is given\r\nagainst ludi ‘in sanctorum vigiliis’ and ‘in exequiis defunctorum.’\r\n\r\n[338] T. F. Kirby, _Wykeham’s Register_ (Hampshire Record Soc.), ii.\r\n410, forbids ‘ad pilas ludere, iactaciones lapidum facere ... coreas\r\nfacere dissolutas, et interdum canere cantilenas, ludibriorum\r\nspectacula facere, saltaciones et alios ludos inhonestos frequentare,\r\nac multas alias insolencias perpetrare, ex quibus cimeterii huiusmodi\r\nexecracio seu pollucio frequencius verisimiliter formidetur.’\r\n\r\n[339] _Handlyng Synne_ (ed. Furnivall), p. 148, l. 4684:\r\n\r\n    ‘Daunces, karols, somour games,\r\n    Of many swych come many shames.’\r\n\r\nThis poem is a free adaptation (†1303) of the thirteenth-century\r\nAnglo-Norman _Manuel de Péché_, which is probably by William de\r\nWadington, but has been ascribed to Bishop Grosseteste himself. The\r\ncorresponding lines in this are\r\n\r\n    ‘Muses et tieles musardries,\r\n    Trippes, dances, et teles folies.’\r\n\r\nCf. also _Handlyng Synne_, p. 278, l. 8989:\r\n\r\n    ‘Karolles, wrastlynges, or somour games,\r\n    Who so euer haunteþ any swyche shames,\r\n    Yy cherche, oþer yn cherche-ȝerde,\r\n    Of sacrylage he may be a ferde;\r\n    Or entyrludës, or syngynge,\r\n    Or tabure bete, or oþer pypynge,\r\n    Alle swychë þyng forbodyn es,\r\n    Whyle þe prest stondeþ at messe’;\r\n\r\nwhere the _Manuel de Péché_ has\r\n\r\n    ‘Karoles ne lutes nul deit fere,\r\n    En seint eglise qe me veut crere;\r\n    Car en cymiter neis karoler\r\n    Est outrage grant, ou luter:\r\n    Souent lur est mes auenu\r\n    Qe la fet tel maner de iu;\r\n    Qe grant peche est, desturber\r\n    Le prestre quant deit celebrer.’\r\n\r\n[340] The Puritan Fetherston, in his _Dialogue agaynst light, lewde,\r\nand lascivious Dancing_ (1583), sign. D. 7, says that he has ‘hearde\r\nof tenne maidens which went to set May, and nine of them came home\r\nwith childe.’ Stubbes, i. 149, has a very similar observation. Cf. the\r\nadventures of Dr. Fitzpiers and Suke Damson on Midsummer Eve in Thomas\r\nHardy’s novel, _The Woodlanders_, ch. xx.\r\n\r\n[341] Grosseteste, in 1236, quotes ‘Isidorus’ as to the pagan origin of\r\n‘_ludi, in quo decertatur de bravio_.’ The reference is to Isidore of\r\nSeville (560-636), _Etymologiarum_, xviii. 27, _De ludis circensibus_\r\n(_P. L._ lxxxii. 653). This, of course, refers directly to the\r\nreligious associations of Roman rather than Celto-Teutonic _ludi_.\r\n\r\n[342] Haddan-Stubbs, iii. 30 ‘idolorum cultus insequere, fanorum\r\naedificia everate.’\r\n\r\n[343] Bede, _Hist. Eccl._ i. 30; Haddan-Stubbs, iii. 37 ‘Dicite\r\n[Augustino], quid diu mecum de causa Anglorum cogitans tractavi:\r\nvidelicet quia fana idolorum destrui in eadem gente minime debeant;\r\nsed ipsa quae in illis sunt idola destruantur, aqua benedicta fiat, in\r\neisdem fanis aspergatur, altaria construantur, reliquiae ponantur: quia\r\nsi fana eadem bene constructa sunt, necesse est ut a cultu daemonum\r\nin obsequium veri Dei debeant commutari, ut dum gens ipsa eadem\r\nfana sua non videt destrui, de corde errorem deponat, et Deum verum\r\ncognoscens ac adorans, ad loca, quae consuevit, familiarius concurrat.\r\nEt quia boves solent in sacrificio daemonum multos occidere, debet\r\neis etiam hac de re aliqua solemnitas immutari: ut die dedicationis,\r\nvel natalitii sanctorum martyrum quorum illic reliquiae ponuntur,\r\ntabernacula sibi circa easdem ecclesias quae ex fanis commutatae\r\nsunt, de ramis arborum faciant, et religiosis conviviis sollemnitatem\r\ncelebrent; nec diabolo iam animalia immolent, sed ad laudem Dei in esum\r\nsuum animalia occidant, et donatori omnium de satietate sua gratias\r\nreferant: ut dum eis aliqua exterius gaudia reservantur, ad interiora\r\ngaudia consentire facilius valeant. Nam duris mentibus simul omnia\r\nabscindere impossibile esse non dubium est, quia et is qui summum locum\r\nascendere nititur gradibus vel passibus non autem saltibus elevatur’....\r\n\r\n[344] Stanley, _Memorials of Canterbury_, 37.\r\n\r\n[345] H. B. Wheatley, _London, Past and Present_, iii. 39; Donne,\r\n_Poems_ (Muses’ Library), ii. 23.\r\n\r\n[346] Bede, ii. 13 ‘iussit sociis destruere ac succendere fanum\r\ncum omnibus septis suis.’ In Essex in a time of plague and famine\r\n(664), Sigheri and his people ‘coeperunt fana, quae derelicta sunt,\r\nrestaurare, et adorare simulacra.’ Bp. Jaruman induced them to reopen\r\nthe churches, ‘relictis sive destructis fanis arisque’ (Bede, iii. 30).\r\n\r\n[347] Bede, ii. 15. So too in eighth-century Germany there were priests\r\nwho were equally ready to sacrifice to Wuotan and to administer the\r\nsacrament of baptism (Gummere, 342). See also Grimm, i. 7, and the\r\nletter of Gregory the Great to queen Brunichildis in _M. G. H. Epist._\r\nii. 1. 7 ‘pervenit ad nos, quod multi Christianorum et ad ecclesias\r\noccurrant, et a culturis daemonum non abscedant.’\r\n\r\n[348] Willibald (_Gesch.-Schreiber der deutschen Vorzeit_, 27) relates\r\nthat in Germany, when Boniface felled the sacred oak of Thor (robur\r\nIovis) he built the wood into a church.\r\n\r\n[349] A Saxon _formula abrenuntiationis_ of the ninth century\r\n(Müllenhoff-Scherer, _Denkmäler deutscher Poesie und Prosa aus dem\r\n8.-12. Jahrhundert_, 1892, No. li) specifically renounces ‘Thuner ende\r\nUuôden ende Saxnôte ende allum thêm unholdum thê hira genôtas sint.’\r\nAnglo-Saxon laws and council decrees contain frequent references to\r\nsacrifices and other lingering remnants of heathenism. Cf. _Councils of\r\nPincanhale and Cealcythe_ (787), c. 19 (Haddan-Stubbs, iii. 458) ‘si\r\nquid ex ritu paganorum remansit, avellatur, contemnatur, abiiciatur.’\r\n_Council of Gratlea_ (928), c. 3 (Wilkins, i. 205) ‘diximus ... de\r\nsacrificiis barbaris ... si quis aliquem occiderit ... ut vitam\r\nsuam perdat.’ _Council of London_ (1075) (Wilkins, i. 363) ‘ne offa\r\nmortuorum animalium, quasi pro vitanda animalium peste, alicubi\r\nsuspendantur; nec sortes, vel aruspicia, seu divinationes, vel aliqua\r\nhuiusmodi opera diaboli ab aliquo exerceantur.’ Also _Leges_ of Wihtred\r\nof Kent (696), c. 12 (Haddan-Stubbs, iii. 235), and other A.-S. laws\r\nquoted by Kemble, i. 523.\r\n\r\n[350] _Penitential of Theodore_ (Haddan-Stubbs, iii. 189), i. 15, _de\r\nCultura Idolorum_; _Penitential of Egbert_ (H.-S. iii. 424), 8, _de\r\nAuguriis vel Divinationibus_.\r\n\r\n[351] Pearson, ii. 1 (Essay on _Woman as Witch_); cf. A.-S. spells in\r\nKemble, i. 528, and Cockayne, _Leechdoms_ (R. S.), iii. 35, 55. Early\r\nand mediaeval Christianity did not deny the existence of the heathen\r\ngods, but treated them as evil spirits, demons.\r\n\r\n[352] An Essex case of 664 has just been quoted. Kemble, i. 358, gives\r\ntwo later ones from the _Chronicle of Lanercost_. In 1268 ‘cum hoc anno\r\nin Laodonia pestis grassaretur in pecudes armenti, quam vocant usitate\r\nLungessouth, quidam bestiales, habitu claustrales non animo, docebant\r\nidiotas patriae ignem confrictione de lignis educere et simulachrum\r\nPriapi statuere, et per haec bestiis succurrere.’ In 1282 ‘sacerdos\r\nparochialis, nomine Johannes, Priapi prophana parans, congregatis ex\r\nvilla puellulis, cogebat eis, choreis factis, Libero patri circuire.’\r\nBy Priapus-Liber is probably meant Freyr, the only Teutonic god\r\nknown to have had Priapic characteristics (Adam of Bremen, _Gesta\r\nHammaburgensis Eccles. Pontif._ iv. 26 in _M. G. H. Script._ vii. 267).\r\n\r\n[353] Grimm, i. 5, 11, 64, 174; iii. xxxiv-xlv; Keary, 90; Pearson, ii.\r\n16, 32, 42, 243, 285, 350. The Virgin Mary succeeds to the place of\r\nthe old Teutonic goddess of fertility, Freyja, Nerthus. So elsewhere\r\ndoes St. Walpurg. The toasts or _minni_ drunk to Odin and Freyja are\r\ntransferred to St. John and St. Gertrude. The travels of Odin and\r\nLoki become the travels of Christ and St. Peter. Many examples of the\r\nadaptation of pre-existing customs to Christianity will be found in the\r\ncourse of this book. A capitulary of Karlmann, drawn up in 742 after\r\nthe synod of Ratisbon held by Boniface in Germany, speaks of ‘hostias\r\nimmolatitias, quas stulti homines iuxta ecclesias ritu pagano faciunt\r\nsub nomine sanctorum martyrum vel confessorum’ (Boretius, _Capitularia\r\nReg. Franc._ i. 24 in _M. G. H._; Mansi, xii. 367). At Kirkcudbright in\r\nthe twelfth century bulls were killed ‘as an alms and oblation to St.\r\nCuthbert’ (_F. L._ x. 353).\r\n\r\n[354] In the present state of Gaulish and still more of Irish studies,\r\nonly a glimmering of possible equations between Teutonic and Keltic\r\ngods is apparent.\r\n\r\n[355] Recent ethnological research is summed up in G. Vacher de\r\nLapouge, _L’Aryen_ (1899); W. Z. Ripley, _The Races of Europe_ (1900);\r\nA. H. Keane, _Ethnology_ (1896); _Man, Past and Present_ (1899); J.\r\nDeniker, _The Races of Man_ (1900); G. Sergi, _The Mediterranean Race_\r\n(1901). The three racial types that, in many pure and hybrid forms,\r\nmainly compose the population of Europe may be distinguished as (1)\r\n_Homo Europaeus_, the tall blonde long-headed (dolichocephalic) race of\r\nnorth Europe, (including Teutons and red-haired ‘Kelts’), to which the\r\nAryan speech seems primarily to have belonged; (2) _Homo alpinus_, the\r\nmedium coloured and sized brachycephalic (round-headed) race of central\r\nEurope; (3) _Homo meridionalis_ (Lapouge) or _mediterranensis_ (Keane),\r\nthe small dark dolichocephalic race of the Mediterranean basin and the\r\nwestern isles (including dark ‘Kelts’). During the formative period of\r\nEuropean culture (2) was probably of little importance, and (1) and (3)\r\nare possibly of closer racial affinity to each other than either of\r\nthem is to (2).\r\n\r\n[356] Gomme, _Ethnology in Folk-lore_, 21; _Village Community_, 69;\r\n_Report of Brit. Ass._ (1896), 626; _F. L. Congress_, 348; _F. L._\r\nx. 129, ascribes the fire customs of Europe to Aryans and the water\r\ncustoms to the pre-Aryans. A. Bertrand, _Religion des Gaulois_, 68,\r\nconsiders human sacrifice characteristically pre-Aryan. There seems\r\nto me more hope of arriving at a knowledge of specific Mediterranean\r\ncults, before the Aryan intermixture, from a study of the stone amulets\r\nand cup-markings of the megaliths (Bertrand, _op. cit._ 42) or from\r\nsuch investigations into ‘Mycenaean’ antiquity as that of A. J. Evans,\r\n_Mycenaean Tree and Pillar Cult_ (1901). The speculations of Nietzsche,\r\nin _A Genealogy of Morals_ and elsewhere, as to the altruistic\r\n‘slave’ morality of the pre-Aryan and the self-regarding morality of\r\nthe conquering Aryan ‘blond beast’ are amusing or pitiful reading,\r\naccording to one’s mood.\r\n\r\n[357] Frazer, _G. B._ i. 9 ‘The fundamental principles on which it\r\n[savage magic] is based would seem to be reducible to two: first, that\r\nlike produces like, or that an effect resembles its cause; and second,\r\nthat things which have once been in contact, but have ceased to be so,\r\ncontinue to act upon each other as if the contact still persisted.\r\nFrom the first of these principles, the savage infers that he can\r\nproduce any desired effect merely by imitating it; from the second he\r\nconcludes that he can influence at pleasure and at any distance any\r\nperson of whom, or any thing of which, he possesses a particle. Magic\r\nof the latter sort, resting as it does on the belief in a certain\r\nsecret sympathy which unites indissolubly things that have once been\r\nconnected with each other may appropriately be termed sympathetic\r\nin the strict sense of the term. Magic of the former kind, in which\r\nthe supposed cause resembles or simulates the supposed effect, may\r\nconveniently be described as imitative or mimetic.’ Cf. Jevons, 31 ‘The\r\nsavage makes the generalization that like produces like; and then he is\r\nprovided with the means of bringing about anything he wishes, for to\r\nproduce an effect he has only to imitate it. To cause a wind to blow,\r\nhe flaps a blanket, as the sailor still whistles to bring a whistling\r\ngale.... If the vegetation requires rain, all that is needed is to dip\r\na branch in water, and with it to sprinkle the ground. Or a spray of\r\nwater squirted from the mouth will produce a mist sufficiently like\r\nthe mist required to produce the desired effect; or black clouds of\r\nsmoke will be followed by black clouds of rain.’ I do not feel that\r\nmagic is altogether a happy term for this sort of savage science. In\r\nits ordinary sense (the ‘black art’), it certainly contains a large\r\nelement of what Dr. Frazer distinguishes from magic as religion, ‘a\r\npropitiation or conciliation of powers superior to man which are\r\nbelieved to direct and control the course of nature and of human life.’\r\nTrue, these powers are not to whom the orthodox religion is directed,\r\nbut the approach to them is religious in the sense of the above\r\ndefinition. Such magic is in fact an amalgam of charms, which are Dr.\r\nFrazer’s ‘magic,’ and spells, which are his ‘religion.’ But so are many\r\nmore recognized cults.\r\n\r\n[358] Some facts of European animal worship are dealt with in two\r\nimportant recent papers, one by S. Reinach in _Revue celtique_, xxi.\r\n269, the other by N. W. Thomas, in _F. L._ xi. 227. The relation of\r\nsuch worship to the group of savage social institutions classed as\r\ntotemism is a difficult and far from solved problem, which cannot be\r\ntouched upon here.\r\n\r\n[359] Gummere, 39; Caesar, _de B. G._ iv. 1. 7; vi. 22. 2; Tacitus,\r\n_Germ._ 26.\r\n\r\n[360] Schräder-Jevons, 281, says that the Indo-Europeans begin their\r\nhistory ‘acquainted with the rudiments of agriculture,’ but ‘still\r\npossessed with nomadic tendencies.’ He adds that considerable progress\r\nmust have been made before the dispersion of the European branches, and\r\npoints out that agriculture would naturally develop when the migratory\r\nhordes from the steppes reached the great forests of central Europe.\r\nFor this there would be two reasons, the greater fertility of the soil\r\nand the narrowed space for pasturage. On the other hand, V. Hehn,\r\n_Culturpflanzen und Haustiere_, and Mommsen, _Hist. of Rome_, i. 16,\r\nfind the traces of agriculture amongst the undivided Indo-Europeans\r\nvery slight; the word yáva-ζέα, which is common to the tongues, need\r\nmean nothing more than a wild cereal.\r\n\r\n[361] Jevons, 240, 255; Pearson, ii. 42; O.

One of the hills so visited is\r\nthe artificial one of Silbury, and perhaps the custom points to the\r\nobject with which this and the similar ‘mound’ at Marlborough were\r\npiled up.\r\n\r\n[363] Frazer, ii. 261, deals very fully with the theriomorphic\r\ncorn-spirits of folk belief.\r\n\r\n[364] On these triads and others in which three male or three female\r\nfigures appear, cf. Bertrand, 341; A. Maury, _Croyances et Légendes\r\ndu Moyen Âge_ (1896), 6; _Matronen-Kultus_ in _Zeitschrift d. Vereins\r\nf. Volkskultur_, ii. 24. I have not yet seen L. L.

Giles, vi. 179) ‘Eostur-monath\r\nqui nunc paschalis mensis interpretatur, quondam a dea illorum, quae\r\nEostre vocabatur, et cui in illo festa celebrabant, nomen habuit;\r\na cuius nomine nunc paschale tempus cognominant, consueto antiquae\r\nobservationis vocabulo gaudia novae solemnitatis vocantes.’ There\r\nseems no reason for thinking with Golther and Tille, that Bede made a\r\nmistake. Charlemagne took the name _Ôstarmánoth_ for April, perhaps\r\nonly out of compliment to the English, such as Alcuin, at his court.\r\n\r\n[368] _A Charm for unfruitful or bewitched land_ (O. Cockayne,\r\n_Leechdoms of Early England_, R. S. i. 399); cf. Grimm, i. 253;\r\nGolther, 455; Kögel, i. 1. 39. The ceremony has taken on a Christian\r\ncolouring, but retains many primitive features. Strips of turf are\r\nremoved, and masses said over them. They are replaced after oil,\r\nhoney, barm, milk of every kind of cattle, twigs of every tree, and\r\nholy water have been put on the spot. Seed is bought at a double price\r\nfrom almsmen and poured into a hole in the plough with salt and herbs.\r\nVarious invocations are used, including one which calls on ‘Erce, Erce,\r\nErce, Eorthan modor,’ and implores the Almighty to grant her fertility.\r\nThen the plough is driven, and a loaf, made of every kind of corn with\r\nmilk and holy water, laid under the first furrow. Kögel considers\r\n_Erce_ to be derived from _ero_, ‘earth.’ Brooke, i. 217, states on\r\nthe authority of Montanus that a version of the prayer preserved in\r\na convent at Corvei begins ‘Eostar, Eostar, Eordhan modor.’ He adds:\r\n‘nothing seems to follow from this clerical error.’ But why an error?\r\nThe equation Erce-Eostre is consistent with the fundamental identity of\r\nthe light-goddess and the earth-goddess.\r\n\r\n[369] Tacitus, _Ann._ i. 51; Mogk, iii. 373; Golther, 458; cf. ch. xii.\r\n\r\n[370] Gomme, _Village Community_, 157; B. C. A. Windle, _Life in Early\r\nBritain_, 200; F. W. Maitland, _Domesday Book and Beyond_, 142, 337,\r\n346.\r\n\r\n[371] I have followed in many points the views on Teutonic chronology\r\nof Tille, _Deutsches Weihnacht_ (1893) and _Yule and Christmas_ (1899),\r\nwhich are accepted in the main by O. Schräder, _Reallexicon der\r\nindogermanischen Altertumskunde_, s.vv. Jahr, Jahreszeiten, and partly\r\ncorrect those of Weinhold, _Ueber die deutsche Jahrtheilung_ (1862),\r\nand Grotefend, _Die Zeitrechnung des deutschen Mittelalters_ (1891).\r\n\r\n[372] In Scandinavia the winter naturally began earlier and ended\r\nlater. Throughout, Scandinavian seasons diverged from those of\r\nGermany and the British Isles. In particular the high summer feast\r\nand the consequent tripartition of the year do not seem to have\r\nestablished themselves (_C. P. B._ i. 430). Further south the period\r\nof stall-feeding was extended when a better supply of fodder made it\r\npossible (Tille, _Y. and C._ 56, 62; Burne-Jackson, 380).\r\n\r\n[373] Cf. ch. xi, where the winter feasts are discussed in more detail.\r\n\r\n[374] Grimm, ii. 675, 693, 762, notes the heralds of summer.\r\n\r\n[375] Jahn, 34; Mogk, iii. 387; Golther, 572; Schräder-Jevons, 303.\r\nThe Germans still knew three seasons only when they came into contact\r\nwith the Romans; cf. Tacitus, _Germ._ 26 ‘annum quoque ipsum non\r\nin totidem digerunt species: hiems et ver et aestas intellectum ac\r\nvocabula habent, autumni perinde nomen ac bona ignorantur.’ I do not\r\nagree with Tille, _Y. and C._ 6, that the tripartition of the year, in\r\nthis pre-calendar form, was ‘of foreign extraction.’ Schräder shows\r\nthat it is common to the Aryan languages. The Keltic seasons, in\r\nparticular, seem to be closely parallel to the Teutonic. Of the three\r\ngreat Keltic feasts described by Rhys, _C. H._ 409, 513, 676; _C. F._\r\ni. 308, the Lugnassad was probably the harvest feast, the Samhain the\r\nold beginning of winter feast, and the Beltain the high summer feast.\r\nThe meaning of ‘Beltain’ (cf. _N. E. D._ s.v. Beltane) seems quite\r\nuncertain. A connexion is possible but certainly unproved with the\r\nAbelio of the Pyrenean inscriptions, the Belenus-Apollo of those of\r\nthe eastern Alps, and, more rarely, Provence (Röscher, _Lexicon_, s.v.\r\nBelenus; Holder, _Alt-celtischer Sprachschatz_, s.vv. Belenus, Abelio;\r\nAusonius, _Professores_, iv. 7), or the Bel of Bohemia mentioned by\r\nAllso (ch. xii). The Semitic Baal, although a cult of Belus, found its\r\nway into the Roman world (cf. Appendix N, No. xxxii, and Wissowa, 302),\r\nis naturally even a less plausible relation. But it is dear to the\r\nfolk-etymologist; cf. e.g. S. M. Mayhew, _Baalism_ in _Trans. of St.\r\nPaul’s Ecclesiological Society_, i. 83.\r\n\r\n[376] Tille, _Y. and C._ 7, 148, suggests an Egyptian or Babylonian\r\norigin, but the equation of the Gothic _Jiuleis_ and the Cypriote\r\nἰλαῖος, ἰουλαῖος, ἰουλίηος, ἰούλιος as names for winter periods makes a\r\nMediterranean connexion seem possible.\r\n\r\n[377] Cf. ch. xi.\r\n\r\n[378] Grimm, ii. 615, notes that Easter fires are normal in the\r\nnorth, Midsummer fires in the south of Germany. The Beltane fires\r\nboth of Scotland and Ireland are usually on May 1, but some of the\r\nIrish examples collected by J. Jamieson, _Etym. Dict. of the Scottish\r\nLanguage_, s. v., are at midsummer.\r\n\r\n[379] Tille, _Y. and C._ 71; Rhys, _C. H._ 419. The primitive year\r\nwas thermometric, not astronomic, its critical moments, not the\r\nsolstices, a knowledge of which means science, but the sensible\r\nincrease and diminution of heat in spring and autumn. The solstices\r\ncame through Rome. The _Sermo Eligii_ (Grimm, iv. 1737) has ‘nullus\r\nin festivitate S. Ioannis vel quibuslibet sanctorum solemnitatibus\r\nsolstitia ... exerceat,’ but Eligius was a seventh-century bishop,\r\nand this _Sermo_ may have been interpolated in the eighth century\r\n(O. Reich, _Über Audoen’s Lebensbeschreibung des heiligen Eligius_\r\n(1872), cited in _Rev. celtique_, ix. 433). It is not clear that the\r\nun-Romanized Teuton or Kelt made a god of the sun, as distinct from the\r\nheaven-god, who of course has solar attributes and emblems. In the same\r\n_Sermo_ Eligius says ‘nullus dominos solem aut lunam vocet, neque per\r\neos iuret.’ But the notion of ‘domini’ may be post-Roman, and the oath\r\nis by the permanent, rather than the divine; cf. A. de Jubainville,\r\n_Intr. à l’Étude de la Litt. celt._ 181. It is noticeable that German\r\nnames for the sun are originally feminine and for the moon masculine.\r\n\r\n[380] Mogk, iii. 393; Golther, 584; Jahn, 84; Caspari, 35; Saupe,\r\n7; Hauck, ii. 357; Michels, 93. The ploughing feast is probably\r\nthe _spurcalia_ of the _Indiculus_ and of Eadhelm, _de laudibus\r\nvirginitatis_, c. 25, and the _dies spurci_ of the _Hom. de\r\nSacrilegiis_. This term appears in the later German name for February,\r\n_Sporkele_. It seems to be founded on Roman analogy from _spurcus_,\r\n‘unclean.’ Pearson, ii. 159, would, however, trace it to an Aryan root\r\n_spherag_, ‘swell,’ ‘burst,’ ‘shoot.’ Bede, _de temp. rat._ c. 15,\r\ncalls February _Sol-monath_, which he explains as ‘mensis placentarum.’\r\nSeptember, the month of the harvest-festival, is _Haleg-monath_, or\r\n‘mensis sacrorum.’\r\n\r\n[381] Pfannenschmidt, 244; Brand, ii. 1; Ditchfield, 130;\r\nBurne-Jackson, 439; Burton, _Rushbearing_, 147; Schaff, vi. 544;\r\nDuchesne, 385. The dedication of churches was solemnly carried out\r\nfrom the fourth century, and the anniversary observed. Gregory the\r\nGreat ordered ‘solemnitates ecclesiarum dedicationum per singulos\r\nannos sunt celebrandae.’ The A.-S. _Canons_ of Edgar (960), c. 28\r\n(Wilkins, i. 227), require them to be kept with sobriety. Originally\r\nthe anniversary, as well as the actual dedication day, was observed\r\nwith an all night watch, whence the name _vigilia_, wakes. Belethus,\r\n_de rat. offic._ (_P. L._ ccii. 141), c. 137, says that the custom was\r\nabolished owing to the immorality to which it led. But the ‘eve’ of\r\nthese and other feasts continued to share in the sanctity of the ‘day,’\r\na practice in harmony with the European sense of the precedence of\r\nnight over day (cf. Schräder-Jevons, 311; Bertrand, 267, 354, 413). An\r\nAct of Convocation in 1536 (Wilkins, iii. 823) required all wakes to\r\nbe held on the first Sunday in October, but it does not appear to have\r\nbeen very effectual.\r\n\r\n[382] S. O. Addy, in _F. L._ xii. 394, has a full account of ‘Garland\r\nday’ at Castleton, Derbyshire, on May 29; cf. _F. L._ xii. 76\r\n(Wishford, Wilts); Burne-Jackson, 365.\r\n\r\n[383] The classification of agricultural feasts in U. Jahn, _Die\r\ndeutschen Opfergebräuche_, seems throughout to be based less on the\r\nfacts of primitive communal agriculture, than on those of the more\r\nelaborate methods of the later farms with their variety of crops.\r\n\r\n[384] Frazer, i. 193; ii. 96; Brand, i. 125; Dyer, 223; Ditchfield, 95;\r\nPhilpot, 144; Grimm, ii. 762; &c., &c.

But\r\nthey are of Gallican origin, were begun by Mamertus, bishop of Vienne\r\n(†470), adapted by the _Council of Orleans_ (511), c. 27 (Mansi, viii.\r\n355), and required by the English _Council of Clovesho_ (747), c. 16\r\n(Haddan-Stubbs, iii. 368), to be held ‘non admixtis vanitatibus, uti\r\nmos est plurimis, vel negligentibus, vel imperitis, id est in ludis\r\net equorum cursibus, et epulis maioribus.’ Jahn, 147, quotes the\r\nGerman abbess Marcsuith (940), who describes them as ‘pro gentilicio\r\nAmbarvali,’ and adds, ‘confido autem de Patroni huius misericordia,\r\nquod sic ab eo gyrade terrae semina uberius provenient, et variae\r\naeris inclementiae cessent.’ Mediaeval Rogation litanies are in _Sarum\r\nProcessional_, 103, and York Processional (_York Manual_, 182). The\r\nmore strictly Roman _litania major_ on St. Mark’s day (March 25) takes\r\nthe place of the _Robigalia_, but is not of great importance in English\r\nfolk-custom.\r\n\r\n[398] _Injunctions_, ch. xix, of 1559 (Gee-Hardy, _Docts. illustrative\r\nof English Church History_, 426). Thanks are to be given to God ‘for\r\nthe increase and abundance of his fruits upon the face of the earth.’\r\nThe _Book of Homilies_ contains an exhortation to be used on the\r\noccasion. The episcopal injunctions and interrogatories in _Ritual\r\nCommission_, 404, 409, 416, &c., endeavour to preserve the Rogations,\r\nand to eliminate ‘superstition’ from them; for the development of the\r\nnotion of ‘beating of bounds,’ cf. the eighteenth-century notices in\r\nDyer, _Old English Social Life_, 196.\r\n\r\n[399] The image is represented by the doll of the May-garland, which\r\nhas sometimes, according to Ditchfield, 102, become the Virgin Mary,\r\nwith a child doll in its arms, and at other times (e.g. Castleton,\r\n_F.

In Northumberland raids are made on the ashes of\r\nneighbouring villages (Dyer, 332).\r\n\r\n[408] Cf. p. 113.\r\n\r\n[409] I know of no English Easter folk-fires, but St. Patrick is said\r\nto have lit one on the hill of Slane, opposite Tara, on Easter Eve, 433\r\n(Feasey, 180).\r\n\r\n[410] Schaff, v. 403; Duchesne, 240; Rock, iii. 2. 71, 94, 98, 107,\r\n244; Feasey, 184; Wordsworth, 204; Frazer, iii. 245; Jahn, 129;\r\nGrimm, ii. 616; Simpson, 198. The formulae of the _benedictio ignis_\r\nand _benedictio cereorum_ at Candlemas, and the _benedictio ignis_,\r\n_benedictio incensi_, and _benedictio cerei_ on Easter Eve, are in\r\n_Sarum Missal_, 334, 697; _York Missal_, i. 109; ii. 17. One York MS.\r\nhas ‘Paschae ignis de berillo vel de silice exceptus ... accenditur.’\r\nThe correspondence between Pope Zacharias and St. Boniface shows\r\nthat the lighting of the _ignis_ by a crystal instead of from a lamp\r\nkept secretly burning distinguished Gallican from Roman ceremonial\r\nin the eighth century (Jaffé, 2291). All the lights in the church\r\nare previously put out, and this itself has become a ceremony in the\r\n_Tenebrae_. Ecclesiastical symbolism explained the extinction and\r\nrekindling of lights as typifying the Resurrection. Sometimes the\r\n_ignis_ provides a light for the folk-fire outside.\r\n\r\n[411] Belethus (†1162), _de Div. Offic._ c. 137 (_P. L._ ccii. 141),\r\ngives three customs of St. John’s Eve. Bones are burnt, because (1)\r\nthere are dragons in air, earth, and water, and when these ‘in aere ad\r\nlibidinem concitantur, quod fere fit, saepe ipsum sperma vel in puteos\r\nvel in aquas fluviales eiiciunt, ex quo lethalis sequitur annus,’ but\r\nthe smoke of the bonfires drives them away; and (2) because St. John’s\r\nbones were burnt in Sebasta. Torches are carried, because St. John was\r\na shining light. A wheel is rolled, because of the solstice, which\r\nis made appropriate to St. John by _St. John_ iii. 30. The account\r\nof Belethus is amplified by Durandus, _Rationale Div. Offic._ (ed.\r\ncorr. Antwerp, 1614) vii. 14, and taken in turn from Durandus by a\r\nfifteenth-century monk of Winchelscombe in a sermon preserved in _Harl.\r\nMS._ 2345, f. 49 (b).\r\n\r\n[412] Gaidoz, 24, 109; Bertrand, 122; Dyer, 323; Stubbes, i. 339, from\r\nNaogeorgos; Usener, ii. 81; and the mediaeval calendar in Brand, i. 179.\r\n\r\n[413] Gomme, in _Brit.

The\r\nEnglish term is _need-fire_, Scotch _neidfyre_, German _Nothfeuer_. It\r\nis variously derived from _nôt_ ‘need,’ _niuwan_ ‘rub,’ or _hniotan_\r\n‘press.’ If the last is right, the English form should perhaps be\r\n_knead-fire_ (Grimm, ii. 607, 609; Golther, 570). Another German term\r\nis _Wildfeuer_. The Gaelic _tin-egin_ is from _tin_ ‘fire,’ and _egin_\r\n‘violence’ (Grimm, ii. 609). For ecclesiastical prohibitions cf.\r\n_Indiculus_ (Saupe, 20) ‘de igne fricato de ligno, i. e. _nodfyr_’;\r\n_Capit. Karlmanni_ (742), c. 5 (Grimm, ii. 604) ‘illos sacrilegos ignes\r\nquos _niedfyr_ vocant.’\r\n\r\n[415] Gaidoz, 1; Bertrand, 109, 140; Simpson, 109, 240; Rhys, _C. H._\r\n54. The commonest form of the symbol is the swastika, but others appear\r\nto be found in the ‘hammer’ of Thor, and on the altars and statues of a\r\nGaulish deity equated in the _interpretatio Romana_ with Jupiter. There\r\nis a wheel decoration on the _barelle_ or cars of the Gubbio _ceri_\r\n(Bower, 4).\r\n\r\n[416] Brand, i. 97; Dyer, 159; Ditchfield, 78. Eggs are used\r\nceremonially at the Scotch Beltane fires (Frazer, iii. 261; Simpson,\r\n285). Strings of birds’ eggs are hung on the Lynn May garland (_F. L._\r\nx. 443). In Dauphiné an omelette is made when the sun rises on St.\r\nJohn’s day (Cortet, 217). In Germany children are sent to look for\r\nthe Easter eggs in the nest of a hare, a very divine animal. Among\r\nthe miscellaneous Benedictions in the _Sarum Manual_, with the _Ben.\r\nSeminis_ and the _Ben. Pomorum in die S^{ti} Iacobi_ are a _Ben.\r\nCarnis Casei Butyri Ovorum sive Pastillarum in Pascha_ and a _Ben.\r\nAgni Paschalis, Ovorum et Herbarum in die Paschae_. These Benedictions\r\nare little more than graces. The _Durham Accounts_, i. 71-174, contain\r\nentries of fifteenth-and sixteenth-century payments ‘fratribus et\r\nsororibus de Wytton pro eorum Egsilver erga festum pasche.’\r\n\r\n[417] _Tw. N._ i. 3. 42 ‘He’s a coward and a coystrill, that will not\r\ndrink to my niece till his brains turn o’ the toe like a parish-top.’\r\nSteevens says ‘a large top was formerly kept in every village, to\r\nbe whipt in frosty weather, that the peasants might be kept warm by\r\nexercise and out of mischief while they could not work.’ This is\r\nevidently a ‘fake’ of the ‘Puck of commentators.’ Hone, _E. D. B._\r\ni. 199, says ‘According to a story (whether true or false), in one\r\nof the churches of Paris, a choir boy used to whip a top marked with\r\n_Alleluia_, written in gold letters, from one end of the choir to the\r\nother.’ The ‘burial of Alleluia’ is shown later on to be a mediaeval\r\nperversion of an agricultural rite. On the whole question of tops, see\r\nHaddon, 255; A. B. Gomme, s. v.\r\n\r\n[418] Leber, ix. 391; Barthélemy, iv. 447; Du Tilliot, 30; Grenier,\r\n385; Bérenger-Féraud, iii. 427; Belethus, c. 120 ‘Sunt nonnullae\r\necclesiae in quibus usitatum est, ut vel etiam episcopi et\r\narchiepiscopi in coenobiis cum suis ludant subditis, ita ut etiam se\r\nad lusum pilae demittant. atque haec quidem libertas ideo dicta est\r\ndecembrica ... quamquam vero magnae ecclesiae, ut est Remensis, hanc\r\nludendi consuetudinem observent, videtur tamen laudabilius esse non\r\nludere’; Durandus, vi. 86 ‘In quibusdam locis hac die, in aliis in\r\nNatali, praelati cum suis clericis ludunt, vel in claustris, vel in\r\ndomibus episcopalibus; ita ut etiam descendant ad ludum pilae, vel\r\netiam ad choreas et cantus, &c.’ Often the ball play was outside the\r\nchurch, but the canons of Evreux on their return from the _procession\r\nnoire_ of May 1, played ‘ad quillas super voltas ecclesiae’; and the\r\nEaster _pilota_ of Auxerre which lasted to 1538, took place in the nave\r\nbefore vespers. Full accounts of this ceremony have been preserved.\r\nThe dean and canons danced and tossed the ball, singing the _Victimae\r\npaschali_. For examples of Easter hand-ball or marbles in English\r\nfolk-custom, cf. Brand, i. 103; Vaux, 240; _F. L._ xii. 75; Mrs. Gomme,\r\ns. v. _Handball_.\r\n\r\n[419] Brand, i. 93; Burne-Jackson, 335. A Norfolk version (_F. L._ vii.\r\n90) has ‘dances as if in agony.’ On the Mendips (_F. L._ v. 339) what\r\nis expected is ‘a lamb in the sun.’ The moon, and perhaps the sun also,\r\nis sometimes ‘wobbly,’ ‘jumping’ or ‘skipping,’ owing to the presence\r\nof strata of air differing in humidity or temperature, and so changing\r\nthe index of refraction (Nicholson, _Golspie_, 186). At Pontesford Hill\r\nin Shropshire (Burne-Jackson, 330) the pilgrimage was on Palm Sunday,\r\nactually to pluck a sprig from a haunted yew, traditionally ‘to look\r\nfor the golden arrow,’ which must be solar. In the Isle of Man hills,\r\non which are sacred wells, are visited on the Lugnassad, to gather\r\nling-berries. Others say that it is because of Jephthah’s daughter, who\r\nwent up and down on the mountains and bewailed her virginity. And the\r\nold folk now stop at home and read _Judges_ xi (Rhys, _C. F._ i. 312).\r\nOn the place of hill-tops in agricultural religion cf. p. 106, and for\r\nthe use of elevated spots for sun-worship at Rome, ch. xi.\r\n\r\n[420] Simpson, _passim_; cf. _F. L._ vi. 168; xi. 220. _Deasil_ is from\r\nGaelic _deas_, ‘right,’ ‘south.’ Mediaeval ecclesiastical processions\r\nwent ‘contra solis cursum et morem ecclesiasticum’ only in seasons of\r\nwoe or sadness (Rock, iii. 2. 182).\r\n\r\n[421] Dr. Murray kindly informs me that the etymology of _withershins_\r\n(A.-S. _wiþersynes_) is uncertain. It is from _wiþer_, ‘against,’\r\nand either some lost noun, or one derived from _séon_, ‘to see,’ or\r\n_sinþ_, ‘course.’ The original sense is simply ‘backwards,’ and the\r\nequivalence with _deasil_ not earlier than the seventeenth century. A\r\nfolk-etymology from _shine_ may account for the aspirate.\r\n\r\n[422] Robertson Smith, _Religion of the Semites_, 196; Jevons, 130;\r\nFrazer, ii. 352; Grant Allen, 318; Hartland, ii. 236; Turnbull, _The\r\nBlood Covenant_. Perhaps, as a third type of sacrifice, should be\r\ndistinguished the ‘alimentary’ sacrifice of food and other things made\r\nto the dead. This rests on the belief in the continuance of the mortal\r\nlife with its needs and desires after death.\r\n\r\n[423] Grimm, i. 47; Golther, 565; Gummere, _G. O._ 40, 457.

It is tempting to\r\ncompare the name _Hockey_ with the _Hock-cart_ of the harvest festival,\r\nand with _Hock-tide_; but it does not really seem to be anything but\r\n_Hookey_. The original of both the hockey-stick and the golf-club was\r\nprobably the shepherd’s crook.

The word has, says Müllenhoff,\r\nall the senses ‘_Spiel, Tanz, Gesang, Opfer, Aufzug_.’ From the same\r\nroot come probably _ludus_, and possibly, through the Celtic, the O. F.\r\n_lai_. The A.-S. _lâc_ is glossed _ludus_, _sacrificium_, _victima_,\r\n_munus_.

An A.-S.\r\nsynonym for _lâc_ is _plega_, ‘play,’ which gives _sweord-plega_ and\r\n_ecg-plega_. _Spil_ is not A.-S. and _spilian_ is a loan-word from O.\r\nH. G.\r\n\r\n[530] Gummere, _B.

Nearly four centuries after the\r\n_C. of Rome_ we find the _C. of Avignon_ (1209), c. 17 (Mansi, xxii.\r\n791) ‘statuimus, ut in sanctorum vigiliis in ecclesiis historicae\r\nsaltationes, obscoeni motus, seu choreae non fiant, nec dicantur\r\namatoria carmina, vel cantilenae ibidem....’ Still later the _C. of\r\nBayeux_ (1300), c. 31 (Mansi, xxv. 66) ‘ut dicit Augustinus, melius\r\nest festivis diebus fodere vel arare, quam choreas ducere’; and so\r\non _ad infinitum_. The pseudo-Augustine _Sermo_, 265, _de Christiano\r\nnomine cum operibus non Christianis_ (_P. L._ xxxix. 2237), which is\r\npossibly by Caesarius of Arles, asserts explicitly the pagan character\r\nof the custom: ‘isti enim infelices et miseri homines, qui balationes\r\net saltationes ante ipsas basilicas sanctorum exercere non metuunt nec\r\nerubescunt, etsi Christiani ad ecclesiam venerint, pagani de ecclesia\r\nrevertuntur; quia ista consuetudo balandi de paganorum observatione\r\nremansit.’ A mediaeval preacher (quoted by A. Lecoy de la Marche,\r\n_Chaire française au Moyen Âge_, 447, from _B. N. Lat.

Julian, _Dict. of Hymn._ 206, gives some English examples.\r\n\r\n[536] Grove, 106.

The dance is headed by the clergy, and\r\nproceeds to a traditional tune from the banks of the Sûre to the\r\nchurch, up sixty-two steps, along the north aisle, round the altar\r\n_deasil_, and down the south aisle. It is curious that until the\r\nseventeenth century only _men_ took part in it. St. Willibrord is\r\nfamous for curing nervous diseases, and the pilgrimage is done by way\r\nof vow for such cures. The local legend asserts that the ceremony had\r\nits origin in an eighth-century cattle-plague, which ceased through an\r\ninvocation of St. Willibrord: it is a little hard on the saint, whose\r\nprohibition of dances at the church-door has just been quoted.\r\n\r\n[538] Bérenger-Féraud, iii. 409. A similarly named saint, St. Martial,\r\nwas formerly honoured in the same way. Every psalm on his day ended,\r\nnot with the _Gloria Patri_, but with a dance, and the chant,\r\n‘Saint-Marceau, pregas per nous, et nous epingaren per vous’ (Du Méril,\r\n_La Com._ 68).\r\n\r\n[539] Cf. p. 26.

Bur._ 191:\r\n\r\n    ‘ludunt super gramina virgines decorae\r\n    quarum nova carmina dulci sonant ore.’\r\n\r\n_Ibid._ 195:\r\n\r\n    ‘ecce florescunt lilia,\r\n    et virginum dant agmina\r\n    summo deorum carmina.’\r\n\r\n[541] W. Fitzstephen, _Descriptio Londin_. (_Mat. for Hist. of Becket_,\r\nR.

Paris points out that dances, other than professional, first\r\nappear in the West after the fall of the Empire. The French terms for\r\ndancing--_baller_, _danser_, _treschier_, _caroler_--are not Latin.\r\nCaroler, however, he thinks to be the Greek χοραυλεῖν, ‘to accompany a\r\ndance with a flute.’ But the French _carole_ was always accompanied,\r\nnot with a flute, but with a sung _chanson_.\r\n\r\n[543] Paris, _loc. cit._ 410; Jeanroy, 391. In Wace’s description of\r\nArthur’s wedding, the women _carolent_ and the men _behourdent_. Cf.\r\nBartsch, _Romanzen und Pastourellen_, i. 13:\r\n\r\n    ‘Cez damoiseles i vont por caroler,\r\n    cil escuier i vont por behorder,\r\n    cil chevalier i vont por esgarder.’\r\n\r\n[544] On the return of Edward II and Isabella of France in 1308, the\r\nmayor and other dignitaries of London went ‘coram rege et regina\r\nkarolantes’ (_Chronicles of Edward I and Edward II_, R. S. i. 152). On\r\nthe birth of Prince Edward in 1312, they ‘menerent la karole’ in church\r\nand street (Riley, 107).\r\n\r\n[545] Kögel, i. 1. 6.\r\n\r\n[546] Mrs. Gomme, ii. 228; Haddon, 345.\r\n\r\n[547] Cf. ch. vi on the motion _deasil_ round the sacred object. It is\r\ncurious that the modern round dances go _withershins_ round a room.\r\nGrimm, i. 52, quotes Gregory the Great, _Dial._ iii. 28 on a Lombard\r\nsacrifice, ‘caput caprae, hoc ei, per circuitum currentes, carmine\r\nnefando dedicantes.’\r\n\r\n[548] At Bradford-on-Avon, Wilts (which preserves its Anglo-Saxon\r\nchurch), and at South Petherton, Somerset, in both cases on Shrove\r\nTuesday (Mrs. Gomme, ii. 230); cf. Vaux, 18. The church at Painswick,\r\nGloucester, is danced round on wake-day (_F. L._ viii. 392). There\r\nis a group of games, in which the players wind and unwind in spirals\r\nround a centre. Such are _Eller Tree_, _Wind up the Bush Faggot_, and\r\n_Bulliheisle_. These Mrs. Gomme regards as survivals of the ritual\r\ndance round a sacred tree. Some obscure references in the rhymes used\r\nto ‘dumplings’ and ‘a bundle of rags’ perhaps connect themselves with\r\nthe cereal cake and the rags hung on the tree for luck. In Cornwall\r\nsuch a game is played under the name of ‘Snail’s Creep’ at certain\r\nvillage feasts in June, and directed by young men with leafy branches.\r\n\r\n[549] Du Méril, _La Com._ 72; Haddon, 346; Grove, 50, 81; Haigh, 14; N.\r\nW.

G. _hîleih_, originally meaning ‘sex-dance,’ comes to\r\nbe ‘wedding.’ The root _hi_, like _wini_ (cf. p. 170), has a sexual\r\nconnotation (Pearson, ii. 132; Kögel, i. 1. 10).\r\n\r\n[552] Coussemaker, _Chants populaires des Flamands de France_, 100:\r\n\r\n    ‘In den hemel is eenen dans:\r\n        Alleluia.\r\n    Daer dansen all’ de maegdekens:\r\n        Benedicamus Domino,\r\n        Alleluia, Alleluia.\r\n    ‘t is voor Amelia:\r\n        Alleluia.\r\n    Wy dansen naer de maegdekens:\r\n        Benedicamus, etc.’\r\n\r\n[553] Frazer, i. 35; Dyer, 7; Northall, 233. A Lancashire song is sung\r\n‘to draw you these cold winters away,’ and wishes ‘peace and plenty’ to\r\nthe household. A favourite French May _chanson_ is\r\n\r\n    ‘Étrennez notre épousée,\r\n        Voici le mois,\r\n    Le joli mois de Mai,\r\n    Étrennez notre épousée\r\n        En bonne étrenne.\r\n        Voici le mois,\r\n    Le joli mois de Mai,\r\n        Qu’on vous amène.’\r\n\r\nIf the _quêteurs_ come on a churl, they have an ill-wishing variant.\r\nThe following is characteristic of the French peasantry:\r\n\r\n    ‘J’vous souhaitons autant d’enfants,\r\n    Qu’y a des pierrettes dans les champs.’\r\n\r\nOften more practical tokens of revenge are shown. The Plough Monday\r\n‘bullocks’ in some places consider themselves licensed to plough up the\r\nground before a house where they have been rebuffed.’\r\n\r\n[554] Mrs. Gomme, ii. 1, 399; Haddon, 343; Du Méril, _La Com._ 81.\r\nAmongst the _jeux_ of the young Gargantua (Rabelais, i. 22) was one ‘à\r\nsemer l’avoyne et au laboureur.’ This probably resembled the games of\r\n_Oats and Beans and Barley_, and _Would you know how doth the Peasant?_\r\nwhich exist in English, French, Catalonian, and Italian versions. On\r\nthe mimetic character of these games, cf. ch. viii.\r\n\r\n[555] Text from _Harl. MS._ 978 in H. E. Wooldridge, _Oxford Hist.\r\nof Music_, i. 326, with full account. The music, to which religious\r\nas well as the secular words are attached, is technically known as a\r\n_rota_ or _rondel_. It is of the nature of polyphonic part-song, and of\r\ncourse more advanced than the typical mediaeval _rondet_ can have been.\r\n\r\n[556] On these songs in general, see Northall, 233;\r\nMartinengo-Cesaresco, 249; Cortet, 153; Tiersot, 191; Jeanroy, 88;\r\nParis, _J. des Savants_ (1891), 685, (1892), 155, 407.\r\n\r\n[557] H. A. Wilson, _Hist. of Magd. Coll._ (1899), 50. Mr. Wilson\r\ndiscredits the tradition that the performance began as a mass for the\r\nobit of Henry VII. The hymn is printed in Dyer, 259; Ditchfield, 96.\r\nIt has no relation to the summer festival, having been written in\r\nthe seventeenth century by Thomas Smith and set by Benjamin Rogers\r\nas a grace. In other cases hymns have been attached to the village\r\nfestivals. At Tissington the well-dressing,’ on Ascension Day includes\r\na clerical procession in which ‘Rock of Ages’ and ‘A Living Stream’ are\r\nsung (Ditchfield, 187). A special ‘Rushbearers’ Hymn’ was written for\r\nthe Grasmere Rushbearing in 1835, and a hymn for St. Oswald has been\r\nrecently added (E. G. Fletcher, _The Rushbearing_, 13, 74).\r\n\r\n[558] Dyer, 240, from Hertfordshire.

Kögel traces an earlier term O. H. G.\r\n_winileih_, A.-S. _winelâc_ = _hîleih_. On the erotic motive in savage\r\ndances, cf. Grosse, 165, 172; Hirn, 229.\r\n\r\n[561] _Romania_, vii. 61; _Trad.

A _jeu_ of\r\n_Robin et Marion_ is recorded also as played at Angers in 1392, but\r\nthere is no proof that this was Adan de la Hale’s play, or a drama at\r\nall. There were folk going ‘desguiziez, à un jeu que l’en dit Robin et\r\nMarion, ainsi qu’il est accoutumé de fere, chacun an, en les foiries\r\nde Penthecouste’ (Guy, 197). The best editions of _Robin et Marion_\r\nare those by E. Langlois (1896), and by Bartsch in _La Langue et la\r\nLittérature françaises_ (1887), col. 523. E. de Coussemaker, _Œuvres\r\nde Adam de la Halle_ (1872), 347, gives the music, and A. Rambeau,\r\n_Die dem Trouvère Adam de la Halle zugeschriebenen Dramen_ (1886),\r\nfacsimiles the text. On Adan de la Hale’s earlier _sottie_ of _La\r\nFeuillée_, see ch. xvi.\r\n\r\n[568] Thomas Wright, _Lyrical Poems of the Reign of Edward I_ (Percy\r\nSoc.).\r\n\r\n[569] Cf. ch. xvii.\r\n\r\n[570] The May-game is probably intended by the ‘Whitsun pastorals’\r\nof _Winter’s Tale_, iv. 4. 134, and the ‘pageants of delight’ at\r\nPentecost, where a boy ‘trimmed in Madam Julias gown’ played ‘the\r\nwoman’s part’ (i. e.

On the other hand\r\nthe King-game in church at Hascombe in 1578 (_Representations_, s. v.\r\nHascombe), was probably a miracle-play of the Magi or Three Kings of\r\nCologne. This belongs to Twelfth night (cf. ch. xix), but curiously the\r\naccounts of St. Lawrence, Reading, contain a payment for the ‘Kyngs of\r\nColen’ on _May day_, 1498 (Kerry, _loc. cit._).\r\n\r\n[576] Cf. ch. xvii. Local ‘lords of misrule’ in the _summer_ occur\r\nat Montacute in 1447-8 (Hobhouse, 183 ‘in expensis Regis de Montagu\r\napud Tyntenhull existentis tempore aestivali’), at Meriden in 1565\r\n(Sharpe, 209), at Melton Mowbray in 1558 (Kelly, 65), at Tombland, near\r\nNorwich (_Norfolk Archaeology_, iii. 7; xi. 345), at Broseley, near\r\nMuch Wenlock, as late as 1652 (Burne-Jackson, 480). See the attack on\r\nthem in Stubbes, i. 146. The term ‘lord of misrule’ seems to have been\r\nborrowed from Christmas (ch. xvii). It does not appear whether the\r\nlords of misrule of Old Romney in 1525 (_Archaeologia Cantiana_, xiii.\r\n216) and Braintree in 1531 (Pearson, ii. 413) were in winter or summer.\r\n\r\n[577] Owen and Blakeway, i. 331; Jackson and Burne, 480 (cf. Appendix\r\nE). Miss Burne suggests several possible derivations of the name; from\r\n_mar_ ‘make mischief,’ from Mardoll or Marwell (St. Mary’s Well),\r\nstreets in Shrewsbury, or from Muryvale or Meryvalle, a local hamlet.\r\nBut the form ‘Mayvoll’ seems to point to ‘Maypole.’\r\n\r\n[578] _Representations_, s. v. Aberdeen. Here the lord of the summer\r\nfeast seems to have acted also as presenter of the Corpus Christi plays.\r\n\r\n[579] Cf. ch. xvii.\r\n\r\n[580] Batman, _Golden Books of the Leaden Gods_ (1577), f. 30. The Pope\r\nis said to be carried on the backs of four deacons, ‘after the maner of\r\ncarying whytepot queenes in Western May games.’ A ‘whitepot’ is a kind\r\nof custard.\r\n\r\n[581] Such phrases occur as ‘the May-play called Robyn Hod’ (Kerry,\r\n_Hist. of St. Lawrence, Reading_, 226, s. a. 1502), ‘Robin Hood and\r\nMay game’ and Kynggam and Robyn Hode’ (_Kingston Accounts_, 1505-36,\r\nin Lysons, _Environs of London_, i. 225). The accounts of St. Helen’s,\r\nAbingdon, in 1566, have an entry ‘for setting up Robin Hood’s bower’\r\n(Brand-Hazlitt, i. 144). It is noticeable that from 1553 Robin Hood\r\nsucceeds the Abbot of Mayvole in the May-game at Shrewsbury (Appendix\r\nE). Similarly, in an Aberdeen order of 1508 we find ‘Robert Huyid\r\nand Litile Johne, quhilk was callit, in yers bipast, Abbat and Prior\r\nof Bonacord’ (_Representations_, s. v. Aberdeen). Robin Hood seems,\r\ntherefore, to have come rather late into the May-games, but to have\r\nenjoyed a widening popularity.\r\n\r\n[582] The material for the study of the Robin Hood legend is gathered\r\ntogether by S. Lee in _D. N. B._ s. v. Hood; Child, _Popular Ballads_,\r\nv. 39; Ritson, _Robin Hood_ (1832); J. M. Gutch, _Robin Hood_ (1847).\r\nProf. Child gives a critical edition of all the ballads.\r\n\r\n[583] _Piers Plowman_, B-text, passus v. 401.\r\n\r\n[584] Fabian, _Chronicle_, 687, records in 1502 the capture of ‘a\r\nfelowe whych hadde renewed many of Robin Hode’s pagentes, which named\r\nhimselfe Greneleef.’\r\n\r\n[585] Cf. p. 177.\r\n\r\n[586] Kühn, in Haupt’s _Zeitschrift_, v. 481.\r\n\r\n[587] Ramsay, _F. E._ i. 168.\r\n\r\n[588] In the Nottingham _Hall-books (Hist. MSS._ i. 105), the same\r\nlocality seems to be described in 1548 as ‘Robyn Wood’s Well,’ and in\r\n1597 as ‘Robyn Hood’s Well.’ Robin Hood is traditionally clad in green.\r\nIf he is mythological at all, may he not be a form of the ‘wild-man’\r\nor ‘wood-woz’ of certain spring dramatic ceremonies, and the ‘Green\r\nKnight’ of romance? Cf. ch. ix.\r\n\r\n[589] The earliest mention of her is (†1500) in A. Barclay, _Eclogue_,\r\n5, ‘some may fit of Maide Marian or else of Robin Hood.’\r\n\r\n[590] _Hist. MSS._ i. 107, from _Convocation Book_, ‘pecuniae ecclesiae\r\nac communitatis Welliae ... videlicet, provenientes ante hoc tempus\r\nde Robynhode, puellis tripudiantibus, communi cervisia ecclesiae, et\r\nhuiusmodi.’\r\n\r\n[591] The accounts of Croscombe, Somerset, contain yearly entries of\r\nreceipts from ‘Roben Hod’s recones’ from 1476 to 1510, and again in\r\n1525 (Hobhouse, 1 sqq.). At Melton Mowbray the amount raised by the\r\n‘lord’ was set aside for mending the highways (Kelly, 65).\r\n\r\n[592] Lysons, _Environs_, i. 225. Mention is made of ‘Robin Hood,’ ‘the\r\nLady,’ ‘Maid Marion,’ ‘Little John,’ ‘the Frere,’ ‘the Fool,’ ‘the\r\nDysard,’ ‘the Morris-dance.’\r\n\r\n[593] _Archaeologia Cantiana_, xiii. 216.\r\n\r\n[594] C. Kerry, _History of St. Lawrence, Reading_, 226. ‘Made Maryon,’\r\n‘the tree’ and ‘the morris-dance,’ are mentioned.\r\n\r\n[595] _L. H. T. Accounts_, ii. 377.\r\n\r\n[596] Stowe, _Survey_ (1598), 38. He is speaking mainly of the period\r\nbefore 1517, when there was a riot on ‘Black’ May-day, and afterwards\r\nthe May-games were not ‘so freely used as before.’\r\n\r\n[597] Appendix E (vi).\r\n\r\n[598] Cf. _Representations_.\r\n\r\n[599] Bower (†1437), _Scotichronicon_ (ed.

The MS. of the fragment\r\nprobably dates before 1475.\r\n\r\n[602] Printed by Child, v. 114, 127; Manly, i. 281, 285. They were\r\noriginally printed as one play by Copland (†1550).\r\n\r\n[603] Printed in Dodsley-Hazlitt, vol. viii. These plays were written\r\nfor Henslowe about February 1598. In November Chettle ‘mended Roben\r\nhood for the corte’ (_Henslowe’s Diary_, 118-20, 139). At Christmas\r\n1600, Henslowe had another play of ‘Roben hoodes penerths’ by William\r\nHaughton (_Diary_, 174-5). An earlier ‘pastoral pleasant comedie of\r\nRobin Hood and Little John’ was entered on the Stationers’ Registers\r\non May 18, 1594. These two are lost, as is _The May Lord_ which Jonson\r\nwrote (_Conversations with Drummond_, 27). Robin Hood also appears in\r\nPeele’s _Edward I_ (†1590), and the anonymous _Look About You_ (1600),\r\nand is the hero of Greene’s _George a Greene the Pinner of Wakefield_\r\n(†1593). Anthony Munday introduced him again into his pageant of\r\n_Metropolis Coronata_ (1615), and a comedy of _Robin Hood and his\r\nCrew of Soldiers_, acted at Nottingham on the day of the coronation\r\nof Charles II, was published in 1661. On all these plays, cf. F. E.\r\nSchelling, _The English Chronicle Play_, 156.\r\n\r\n[604] Furnivall, _Robert Laneham’s Letter_, clxiii.

At an ‘ale’ a cask of home-brewed was broached for sale in the\r\nchurch or church-house, and the profits went to some public object; at\r\na church-ale to the parish, at a clerk-ale to the clerk, at a bride-ale\r\nor bridal to the bride, at a bid-ale to some poor man in trouble. A\r\nlove-ale was probably merely social.\r\n\r\n[607] At Reading in 1557 (C.

On _Scot-ale_, cf. Ducange, s. v. Scotallum;\r\n_Archaeologia_, xii. 11; H. T. Riley, _Munimenta Gildhallae Londin_.\r\n(R. S.), ii. 760. The term first appears as the name of a tax, as\r\nin a Northampton charter of 1189 (Markham-Cox, _Northampton Borough\r\nRecords_, i. 26) ‘concessimus quod sint quieti de ... Brudtol et\r\nde Childwite et de hieresgiue et de Scottale, ita quod Prepositus\r\nNorthamptonie ut aliquis alius Ballivus scottale non faciat’; cf. the\r\nthirteenth-century examples quoted by Ducange. The _Council of Lambeth_\r\n(1206), c. 2, clearly defines the term as ‘communes potationes,’ and\r\nthe primary sense is therefore probably that of an _ale_ at which a\r\n_scot_ or tax is raised.\r\n\r\n[613] Malory, _Morte d’ Arthur_, xix. 1. 2.\r\n\r\n[614] Hall, 515, 520, 582; Brewer, _Letters and Papers of Henry VIII_,\r\nii. 1504.

In 1559, e.g. ‘the xxiiij of\r\nJune ther was a May-game ... and Sant John Sacerys, with a gyant, and\r\ndrumes and gunes [and the] ix wordes (worthies), with spechys, and a\r\ngoodly pagant with a quen ... and dyvers odur, with spechys; and then\r\nSant Gorge and the dragon, the mores dansse, and after Robyn Hode and\r\nlytyll John, and M[aid Marian] and frere Tuke, and they had spechys\r\nround a-bout London.’\r\n\r\n[618] ‘Mr. Tomkys publicke prechar’ in Shrewsbury induced the bailiffs\r\nto ‘reform’ May-poles in 1588, and in 1591 some apprentices were\r\ncommitted for disobeying the order. A judicial decision was, however,\r\ngiven in favour of the ‘tree’ (Burne-Jackson, 358; Hibbert, _English\r\nCraft-Gilds_, 121). In London the Cornhill May-pole, which gave its\r\nname to St. Andrew Undershaft, was destroyed by persuasion of a\r\npreacher as early as 1549 (Dyer, 248); cf. also Stubbes, i. 306, and\r\nMorrison’s advice to Henry VIII quoted in ch. xxv.\r\n\r\n[619] Archbishop Grindal’s _Visitation Articles_ of 1576 (_Remains_,\r\nParker Soc. 175), ‘whether the minister and churchwardens have\r\nsuffered any lords of misrule or summer lords or ladies, or any\r\ndisguised persons, or others, in Christmas or at May-games, or any\r\nmorris-dancers, or at any other times, to come unreverently into the\r\nchurch or churchyard, and there to dance, or play any unseemly parts,\r\nwith scoffs, jests, wanton gestures, or ribald talk, namely in the\r\ntime of Common Prayer.’ Similarly worded _Injunctions_ for Norwich\r\n(1569), York (1571), Lichfield (1584), London (1601) and Oxford (1619)\r\nare quoted in the _Second Report_ of the Ritual Commission; cf.\r\nthe eighty-eighth _Canon_ of 1604. It is true that the _Visitation\r\nArticles_ for St. Mary’s, Shrewsbury, in 1584 inquire more generally\r\n‘whether there have been any lords of mysrule, or somer lords or\r\nladies, or any disguised persons, as morice dancers, maskers, or\r\nmum’ers, or such lyke, within the parishe, ether in the nativititide\r\nor in som’er, or at any other tyme, and what be their names’; but this\r\nchurch was a ‘peculiar’ and its ‘official’ the Puritan Tomkys mentioned\r\nin the last note (Owen and Blakeway, i. 333; Burne-Jackson, 481).\r\n\r\n[620] Stafford, 16.\r\n\r\n[621] Stubbes, i. 146; cf. the further quotations and references there\r\ngiven in the notes.\r\n\r\n[622] 6 _Mary_, cap. 61.\r\n\r\n[623] Child, v. 45; cf. _Representations_, s.v.

Amongst such customs are the expulsion of\r\nSatan on New Year’s day by the Finns, the expulsion of Kore at Easter\r\nin Albania, the expulsion of witches on March 1 in Calabria, and on\r\nMay 1 in the Tyrol, the frightening of the wood-sprites Strudeli and\r\nSträtteli on Twelfth night at Brunnen in Switzerland. Such ceremonies\r\nare often accompanied with a horrible noise of horns, cleavers and\r\nthe like. Horns are also used at Oxford (Dyer, 261) and elsewhere on\r\nMay 1, and I have heard it said that the object of the Oxford custom\r\nis to drive away evil spirits. Similar discords are _de rigueur_ at\r\nSkimmington Ridings.

He challenged any man of the Round Table\r\nto deal him a buffet with the axe on condition of receiving one in\r\nreturn after the lapse of a year. Sir Gawain accepts. The stranger’s\r\nhead is cut off, but he picks it up and rides away with it. This is a\r\nclose parallel to the resurrection of the slain ‘wild man.’\r\n\r\n[638] Frazer, ii. 105, 115, 163, 219; _Pausanias_, iii. 53; v. 259;\r\nGardner, _New Chapters in Greek History_, 395, give Russian, Greek, and\r\nAsiatic parallels.\r\n\r\n[639] Frazer, ii. 71; Pfannenschmidt, 302.

Portuguese sailors\r\nin English docks thrash and duck an effigy of Judas Iscariot on Good\r\nFriday (Dyer, 155).\r\n\r\n[641] Alleluia was not sung during Lent. Fosbrooke, _British\r\nMonachism_, 56, describes the Funeral of Alleluia by the choristers\r\nof an English cathedral on the Saturday before Septuagesima. A turf\r\nwas carried in procession with howling to the cloisters. Probably this\r\ncathedral was Lincoln, whence Wordsworth, 105, quotes payments ‘pro\r\nexcludend’ Alleluya’ from 1452 to 1617.

Here it took place from St. Stephen’s\r\nto New Year’s Day. There were six lads, a fiddler, Bessy and a Doctor.\r\nAt Whitby, six dancers went with the ‘Plough Stots’ on Plough Monday.\r\nThe figures included the placing of a hexagon or rose of swords on\r\nthe head of one of the performers. The dance was accompanied with\r\n‘_Toms_ or _clowns_’ masked or painted, and ‘_Madgies_ or Madgy-Pegs’\r\nin women’s clothes. Sometimes a farce, with a king, miller, clown and\r\ndoctor was added (G. Young, _Hist. of Whitby_ (1817), ii. 880).\r\n\r\n[671] Cf. Appendix J.\r\n\r\n[672] R.

Bell, _Ancient Poems, Ballads and Songs of the Peasantry of\r\nEngland_, 175 (from Sir C. Sharpe’s _Bishoprick Garland_). A Christmas\r\ndance. The captain began the performance by drawing a circle with his\r\nsword. Then the Bessy introduced the captain, who called on the rest in\r\nturn, each walking round the circle to music. Then came an elaborate\r\ndance with careful formations, which degenerated into a fight. Bell\r\nmentions a similar set of verses from Devonshire.\r\n\r\n[677] Bell, 172. A Christmas dance. The clown makes the preliminary\r\ncircle with his sword, and calls on the other dancers.\r\n\r\n[678] Bell, 181. The clown calls for ‘a room,’ after which one of the\r\nparty introduces the rest. This also is a Christmas dance, but as the\r\nwords ‘we’ve come a pace-egging’ occur, it must have been transferred\r\nfrom Easter. Bell says that a somewhat similar performance is given\r\nat Easter in Coniston, and Halliwell, _Popular Rhymes and Nursery\r\nTales_, 244, describes a similar set of rhymes as used near York for\r\npace-egging.\r\n\r\n[679] Described by Müllenhoff, 138, from _Ausland_ (1857), No. 4, f.\r\n81.

He dates the window in\r\nthe reign of Henry VIII; Douce, 585, a better authority, ascribes it to\r\nthat of Edward IV.\r\n\r\n[688] Ben Jonson, _The Gipsies Metamorphosed_ (ed. Cunningham, iii.\r\n151):\r\n\r\n‘_Clod._ They should be morris-dancers by their gingle, but they have\r\nno napkins.\r\n\r\n‘_Cockrel._ No, nor a hobby-horse.\r\n\r\n‘_Clod._ Oh, he’s often forgotten, that’s no rule; but there is no Maid\r\nMarian nor Friar amongst them, which is the surer mark.\r\n\r\n‘_Cockrel._ Nor a fool that I see.’\r\n\r\n[689] The lady, the fool, the hobby-horse are all in Tollet’s window,\r\nand in a seventeenth-century printing by Vinkenboom from Richmond\r\npalace, engraved by Douce, 598; Burton, 105. Cf. the last note and\r\nother passages quoted by Douce, Brand, and Burton. In _Two Noble\r\nKinsmen_, iii. 5, 125, a morris of six men and six women is thus\r\npresented by Gerrold, the schoolmaster:\r\n\r\n    ‘I first appear ...\r\n    The next, the Lord of May and Lady bright,\r\n    The Chambermaid and Serving-man, by night\r\n    That seek out silent hanging: then mine Host\r\n    And his fat Spouse, that welcomes to their cost\r\n    The galled traveller, and with a beck’ning\r\n    Informs the tapster to inflame the reck’ning:\r\n    Then the beast-eating Clown, and next the Fool,\r\n    The Bavian, with long tail and eke long tool;\r\n    _Cum multis aliis_, that make a dance.’\r\n\r\nEvidently some of these _dramatis personae_ are not traditional; the\r\ningenuity of the presenter has been at work on them. ‘Bavian’ as a\r\nname for the fool, is the Dutch _baviaan_, ‘baboon.’ His ‘tail’ is to\r\nbe noted; for the phallic shape sometimes given to the bladder which\r\nhe carries, cf. Rigollot, 164. In the Betley window the fool has a\r\nbauble; in the Vinkenboom picture a staff with a bladder at one end,\r\nand a ladle (to gather money in) at the other. In the window the ladle\r\nis carried by the hobby-horse. ‘The hobby-horse is forgot’ is a phrase\r\noccurring in _L. L. L._ iii. 1. 30; _Hamlet_, iii. 2. 144, and alluded\r\nto by Beaumont and Fletcher, _Women Pleased_, iv. 1, and Ben Jonson,\r\nin the masque quoted above, and in _The Satyr_ (Cunningham, ii. 577).\r\nApparently it is a line from a lost ballad.\r\n\r\n[690] Stubbes, i. 147, of the ‘devil’s daunce’ in the train of the lord\r\nof misrule, evidently a morris, ‘then haue they their Hobby-horses,\r\ndragons & other Antiques.’ In W. Sampson’s _Vow-breaker_ (1636), one\r\nmorris-dancer says ‘I’ll be a fiery dragon’; another, ‘I’ll be a\r\nthund’ring Saint George as ever rode on horseback.’\r\n\r\n[691] Burton, 40, 43, 48, 49, 56, 59, 61, 65, 69, 75, 115, 117, 121,\r\n123, cites many notices throughout the century, and gives several\r\nfigures. The morris is in request at wakes and rushbearings. Both\r\nmen and women dance, sometimes to the number of twenty or thirty.\r\nGay dresses are worn, with white skirts, knee-breeches and ribbons.\r\nHandkerchiefs are carried or hung on the arm or wrist, or replaced\r\nby dangling streamers, cords, or skeins of cotton. Bells are not\r\nworn on the legs, but jingling horse-collars are sometimes carried\r\non the body. There is generally a fool, described in one account as\r\nwearing ‘a horrid mask.’ He is, however, generally black, and is known\r\nas ‘King Coffee’ (Gorton), ‘owd sooty-face,’ ‘dirty Bet,’ and ‘owd\r\nmolly-coddle.’ This last name, like the ‘molly-dancers’ of Gorton,\r\nseems to be due to a linguistic corruption. In 1829 a writer describes\r\nthe fool as ‘a nondescript, made up of the ancient fool and Maid\r\nMarian.’ At Heaton, in 1830, were two figures, said to represent Adam\r\nand Eve, as well as the fool. The masked fool, mentioned above, had as\r\ncompanion a shepherdess with lamb and crook.\r\n\r\n[692] Burton, 115, from _Journal of Archaeol. Assoc._ vii. 201. The\r\ndancers went on Twelfth-night, without bells, but with a fool, a\r\n‘fool’s wife’ and sometimes a hobby-horse.\r\n\r\n[693] Jackson and Burne, 402, 410, 477. The morris-dance proper is\r\nmainly in south Shropshire and at Christmas. At Shrewsbury, in 1885,\r\nwere ten dancers, with a fool. Five carried trowels and five short\r\nstaves which they clashed. The fool had a black face, and a bell on\r\nhis coat. No other bells are mentioned. Staves or wooden swords are\r\nused at other places in Shropshire, and at Brosely all the faces are\r\nblack. The traditional music is a tabor and pipe. A 1652 account of the\r\nBrosely dance with six sword-bearers, a ‘leader or lord of misrule’ and\r\na ‘vice’ (cf. ch. xxv) called the ‘lord’s son’ is quoted. In north-east\r\nShropshire, the Christmas ‘guisers’ are often called ‘morris-dancers,’\r\n‘murry-dancers,’ or ‘merry-dancers.’ In Shetland the name ‘merry\r\ndancers’ is given to the _aurora borealis_ (J. Spence, _Shetland\r\nFolk-Lore_, 116).\r\n\r\n[694] _Leicester F. L._ 93. The dance was on Plough Monday with paper\r\nmasks, a plough, the bullocks, men in women’s dresses, one called Maid\r\nMarian, Curly the fool, and Beelzebub. This is, I think, the only\r\nsurvival of the name Maid Marian, and it may be doubted if even this is\r\nreally popular and not literary.\r\n\r\n[695] P. Manning, _Oxfordshire Seasonal Festivals_, in _F. L._\r\nviii. 317, summarizes accounts from fourteen villages, and gives\r\nillustrations. There are always six dancers. A broad garter of\r\nbells is worn below the knee. There are two sets of figures: in one\r\nhandkerchiefs are carried, in the other short staves are swung and\r\nclashed. Sometimes the dancers sing to the air, which is that of an\r\nold country-dance. There is always a fool, who carries a stick with a\r\nbladder and cow’s tail, and is called in two places ‘Rodney,’ elsewhere\r\nthe ‘squire.’ The music is that of a pipe and tabor (‘whittle’ and\r\n‘dub’) played by one man; a fiddle is now often used. At Bampton there\r\nwas a solo dance between crossed tobacco-pipes. At Spelsbury and at\r\nChipping Warden the dance used to be on the church-tower. At the\r\nBampton Whit-feast and the Ducklington Whit-hunt, the dancers were\r\naccompanied by a sword-bearer, who impaled a cake. A sword-bearer also\r\nappears in a list of Finstock dancers, given me by Mr. T. J. Carter,\r\nof Oxford. He also told me that the dance on Spelsbury church-tower,\r\nseventy years ago, was by women.\r\n\r\n[696] Norfolk, Monmouthshire, Berkshire (Douce, 606); Worcestershire,\r\nNorthamptonshire, Gloucestershire, Somersetshire, Wiltshire,\r\nWarwickshire, and around London (Burton, 114).\r\n\r\n[697] _L. H. T. Accounts_, ii. 414; iii. 359, 381.\r\n\r\n[698] Pfannenschmidt, 582; Michels, 84; Creizenach, i. 411. Burton,\r\n102, reproduces, from _Art Journal_ (1885), 121, cuts of ten\r\nmorris-dancers carved in wood at Munich by Erasmus Schnitzer in 1480.\r\n\r\n[699] Douce, 585, and Burton, 97, reproduce Israel von Mecheln’s\r\nengraving (†1470) of a morris with a fool and a lady.\r\n\r\n[700] Coquillart, _Œuvres_ (†1470), 127.\r\n\r\n[701] _Mémoires de Pétrarque_, ii. app. 3, 9; Petrarch danced ‘en\r\npourpoint une belle et vigoureuse moresque’ to please the Roman ladies\r\non the night of his coronation.\r\n\r\n[702] _Somers Tracts_, ii. 81, 87. The Earl of Nottingham, when on\r\nan embassy from James I, saw morrice-dancers in a Corpus Christi\r\nprocession.\r\n\r\n[703] Douce, 480; Favine, _Theater of Honor_, 345: at a feast given by\r\nGaston de Foix at Vendôme, in 1458, ‘foure young laddes and a damosell,\r\nattired like savages, daunced (by good direction) an excellent\r\n_Morisco_, before the assembly.’\r\n\r\n[704] Tabourot, _Orchésographie_, 94: in his youth a lad used to come\r\nafter supper, with his face blackened, his forehead bound with white or\r\nyellow taffeta, and bells on his legs, and dance the morris up and down\r\nthe hall.\r\n\r\n[705] Douce, 577; Burton, 95.\r\n\r\n[706] A dance certainly of Moorish origin is the fandango, in which\r\ncastanets were used; cf. the comedy of _Variety_ (1649) ‘like a\r\nBacchanalian, dancing the Spanish Morisco, with knackers at his\r\nfingers’ (Strutt, 223). This, however, seems to show that the fandango\r\nwas considered a variety of morisco. Douce, 602; Burton, 124, figure an\r\nAfrican woman from Fez dancing with bells on her ankles. This is taken\r\nfrom Hans Weigel’s book of national costumes published at Nuremberg in\r\n1577.\r\n\r\n[707] Tabourot’s morris-dancing boy had his face blackened, and Junius\r\n(F. Du Jon), _Etymologicum Anglicanum_ (1743), says of England ‘faciem\r\nplerumque inficiunt fuligine, et peregrinum vestium cultum assumunt,\r\nqui ludicris talibus indulgent, ut Mauri esse videantur, aut e longius\r\nremota patria credantur advolasse, atque insolens recreationis genus\r\nad vexisse.’ In _Spousalls of Princess Mary_ (1508) ‘morisks’ is\r\nrendered ‘ludi Maurei quas morescas dicunt.’ In the modern morris the\r\nblack element is represented, except at Brosely, chiefly by ‘owd sooty\r\nface,’ the fool: in Leicestershire it gives rise to a distinct figure,\r\nBeelzebub.\r\n\r\n[708] Du Méril, _La Com._ 89, quotes a sixteenth-century French\r\nsword-dance of ‘Mores, Sauvages, et Satyres.’ In parts of Yorkshire the\r\nsword-dancers had black faces or masks (Henderson, 70).\r\n\r\n[709] Cotgrave, ‘_Dancer les Buffons_, To daunce a morris.’ The term\r\n‘the madman’s morris’ appears as the name of the dance in _The Figure\r\nof Nine_ (temp. Charles II); cf. Furnivall, _Laneham’s Letter_, clxii.\r\nThe _buffon_ is presumably the ‘fool’; cf. Cotgrave, ‘_Buffon_: m. A\r\nbuffoon, jeaster, sycophant, merrie fool, sportfull companion: one that\r\nlives by making others merrie.’\r\n\r\n[710] Henderson, 70. In Yorkshire the sword-dancers carried the image\r\nof a white horse; in Cheshire a horse’s head and skin.\r\n\r\n[711] Cf. ch. x; also Wise, _Enquiries concerning the\r\nInhabitants, ... of Europe_, 51 ‘the common people in many parts of\r\nEngland still practise what they call a Morisco dance, in a wild\r\nmanner, and as it were in armour, at proper intervals striking upon one\r\nanother’s staves,’ &c. Johnson’s _Dictionary_ (1755) calls the morris\r\n‘a dance in which bells are gingled, or staves or swords clashed.’\r\n\r\n[712] Müllenhoff, 124; cf. Mayer, 236.\r\n\r\n[713] Douce, 602; Burton, 123. The bells were usually fastened upon\r\nbroad garters, as they are still worn in Oxfordshire. But they also\r\nappear as anklets or are hung on various parts of the dress. In a\r\ncut from Randle Holme’s _Academie of Armorie_, iii. 109 (Douce, 603;\r\nBurton, 127), a morris-dancer holds a pair of bells in his hands.\r\nSometimes the bells were harmonized. In _Pasquil and Marforius_ (1589)\r\nPenry is described as ‘the fore gallant of the Morrice with the treble\r\nbells’; cf. Rowley, _Witch of Edmonton_, i. 2.\r\n\r\n[714] Müllenhoff, 123; Mayer, 235.\r\n\r\n[715] Tabourot, _Orchésographie_, 97.\r\n\r\n[716] Cf. Appendix J. A figure with a bow and arrow occurs in the\r\nAbbots Bromley horn-dance (p. 166).\r\n\r\n[717] W. Kempe’s _Nine Days Wonder_ (ed. Dyce, Camden Soc.) describes\r\nhis dancing of the morris in bell-shangles from London to Norwich in\r\n1599.\r\n\r\n[718] Müllenhoff, 114.\r\n\r\n[719] The ‘Squire’s Son’ of the Durham dances is probably the clown’s\r\nson of the Wharfdale version; for the term ‘squire’ is not an uncommon\r\none for the rustic fool. Cf. also the Revesby play described in the\r\nnext chapter. Why the fool should have a son, I do not know.\r\n\r\n[720] The ‘Nine Worthies’ of _Love’s Labour’s Lost_, v. 2, are a\r\npageant not a dance, and the two sets of speeches quoted from Bodl.\r\nTanner MS. 407, by Ritson, _Remarks on Shakespeare_, 38, one of which\r\nis called by Ashton, 127, the earliest mummers’ play that he can find,\r\nalso probably belong to pageants. The following, also quoted by Ritson\r\n_loc. cit._ from _Harl. MS._ 1197, f. 101* (sixteenth century), looks\r\nmore like a dance or play:\r\n\r\n    ‘I ame a knighte\r\n    And menes to fight\r\n      And armet well ame I\r\n    Lo here I stand\r\n    With swerd ine hand\r\n      My manhoud for to try.\r\n\r\n    Thou marciall wite\r\n    That menes to fight\r\n      And sete vppon me so\r\n    Lo heare J stand\r\n    With swrd in hand\r\n      To dubbelle eurey blow.’\r\n\r\n[721] Mayer, 230, 425, finds in the dance a symbolical drama of the\r\ndeath of winter; but he does not seem to see the actual relic of a\r\nsacrificial rite.\r\n\r\n[722] Müllenhoff, 114; Du Méril, _La Com._ 82; Plato, _Leges_, 815;\r\nDion Cassius, lx. 23; Suetonius, _Julius_, 39, _Nero_, 12; Servius\r\n_ad Aen._ v. 602; cf. p. 7. A Thracian sword-dance, ending in a mimic\r\ndeath, and therefore closely parallel to the west European examples\r\nmentioned in the next chapter, is described by Xenophon, _Anabasis_, v.\r\n9.\r\n\r\n[723] Müllenhoff, 115; Frazer, iii. 122; W. W. Fowler, _The Roman\r\nFestivals_, 38, 44. The song of the _Salii_ mentioned Saeturnus,\r\ngod of sowing. It appears also to have been their function to expel\r\nthe Mamurius Veturius in spring. Servius _ad Aen._ viii. 285, says\r\nthat the _Salii_ were founded by Morrius, king of Veii. According to\r\nFrazer, Morrius is etymologically equivalent to Mamurius--Mars. He even\r\nsuggests that Morris may possibly belong to the same group of words.\r\n\r\n[724] Cf. Appendix J. In other dances a performer stands on a similar\r\n‘knot’ or _Stern_ of swords. Mayer, 230, suggests that this may\r\nrepresent the triumph of summer, which seems a little far-fetched.\r\n\r\n[725] Mayer, 243; O. Wittstock, in _Sievers-Festgabe_, 349.\r\n\r\n[726] Grimm, i. 304, gives the following as communicated to him by J.\r\nM. Kemble, from the mouth of an old Yorkshireman: ‘In some parts of\r\nnorthern England, in Yorkshire, especially Hallamshire, popular customs\r\nshow remnants of the worship of Fricg. In the neighbourhood of Dent, at\r\ncertain seasons of the year, especially autumn, the country folk hold\r\na procession and perform old dances, one called the giant’s dance: the\r\nleading giant they name _Woden_, and his wife _Frigga_, the principal\r\naction of the play consisting in two swords being swung and clashed\r\ntogether about the neck of a boy without hurting him.’ There is nothing\r\nabout this in the account of Teutonic mythology in J. M. Kemble’s own\r\n_Saxons in England_. I do not believe that the names of Woden and\r\nFrigga were preserved in connexion with this custom continuously from\r\nheathen times. Probably some antiquary had introduced them; and in\r\nerror, for there is no reason to suppose that the ‘clown’ and ‘woman’\r\nof the sword-dance were ever thought to represent gods. But the\r\ndescription of the business with the swords is interesting.\r\n\r\n[727] Müllenhoff, _Z. f. d. A._ xviii. 11, quoting Covarubias, _Tesoro\r\ndella lengua castellana_ (1611), s.v. _Danza de Espadas_: ‘una mudanza\r\nque llaman la degollada, porque cercan el cuello del que los guia con\r\nlas espadas.’ With these sword manœuvres should be compared the use\r\nof scythes and flails in the mock sacrifices of the harvest-field and\r\nthreshing-floor (p. 158), the ‘Chop off his head’ of the ‘Oranges and\r\nLemons’ game (p. 151), and the ancient tale of Wodan and the Mowers.\r\n\r\n[728] Mayer, 229.\r\n\r\n[729] _Gentleman’s Magazine_, lxxxi (1811), 1. 423. The dance was given\r\nin the north Riding from St. Stephen’s day to the New Year. Besides the\r\nBessy and the Doctor there were six lads, one of whom acted king ‘in a\r\nkind of farce which consists of singing and dancing.’\r\n\r\n[730] Bell, 178; cf. p. 193. I do not feel sure whether the actual\r\nparish clergyman took part, or whether a mere personage in the play\r\nis intended; but see what Olaus Magnus (App. J (i)) says about the\r\npropriety of the sword-dances for _clerici_. It will be curious if the\r\nChristian priest has succeeded to the part of the heathen priest slain,\r\nfirst literally, and then in mimicry, at the festivals.\r\n\r\n[731] Printed by Mr. T. F. Ordish in _F. L. J._ vii. 338, and again by\r\nManly, i. 296. The MS. used appears to be headed ‘October Ye 20, 1779’;\r\nbut the performers are called ‘The Plow Boys or Morris Dancers’ and the\r\nprologue says that they ‘takes delight in Christmas toys.’ I do not\r\ndoubt that the play belonged to Plough Monday, which only falls just\r\noutside the Christmas season.\r\n\r\n[732] On the name Pickle Herring, see W. Creizenach, _Die Schauspiele\r\nder englischen Komödianten_, xciii. It does not occur in old English\r\ncomedy, but was introduced into Anglo-German and German farce as a name\r\nfor the ‘fool’ or ‘clown’ by Robert Reynolds, the ‘comic lead’ of a\r\ncompany of English actors who crossed to Germany in 1618. Probably it\r\nwas Reynolds’ invention, and suggested by the _sobriquet_ ‘Stockfish’\r\ntaken by an earlier Anglo-German actor, John Spencer. The ‘spicy’ names\r\nof the other Revesby clowns are probably imitations of Pickle Herring.\r\n\r\n[733] The lines (197-8)\r\n\r\n    ‘Our old Fool’s bracelet is not made of gold\r\n    But it is made of iron and good steel’\r\n\r\nsuggest the vaunt of the champions in the St. George plays.\r\n\r\n[734] Is ‘Anthony’ a reminiscence of the Seven Champions? The Fool says\r\n(ll. 247-9), like Beelzebub in the St. George plays,\r\n\r\n    ‘Here comes I that never come yet, ...\r\n    I have a great head but little wit.’\r\n\r\nHe also jests (l. 229) on his ‘tool’; cf. p. 196 n.\r\n\r\n[735] Brand, i. 278; Dyer, 37; Ditchfield, 47; Drake, 65; Mrs. Chaworth\r\nMusters, _A Cavalier Stronghold_, 387. Plough Monday is the Monday\r\nafter Twelfth night, when the field work begins. A plough is dragged\r\nround the village and a _quête_ made. The survivals of the custom are\r\nmainly in the north, east and east midlands. In the city, a banquet\r\nmarks the day. A Norfolk name is ‘Plowlick Monday,’ and a Hunts one\r\n‘Plough-Witching.’ The plough is called the ‘Fool Plough,’ ‘Fond\r\nPlough,’ ‘Stot Plough’ or ‘White Plough’; the latter name probably from\r\nthe white shirts worn (cf. p. 200). At Cropwell, Notts, horses cut out\r\nin black or red adorn these. In Lincolnshire, bunches of corn were worn\r\nin the hats. Those who draw the plough are called ‘Plough Bullocks,’\r\n‘Boggons’ or ‘Stots.’ They sometimes dance a morris-or sword-dance,\r\nor act a play. At Haxey, they take a leading part in the Twelfth\r\nday ‘Hood-game’ (p. 150). In Northants their faces are blackened or\r\nreddled. The plough is generally accompanied by the now familiar\r\ngrotesques, ‘Bessy’ and the Fool or ‘Captain Cauf-Tail.’ In Northants\r\nthere are two of each; the Fools have humps, and are known as ‘Red\r\nJacks’; there is also a ‘Master.’ In Lincolnshire, reapers, threshers,\r\nand carters joined the procession. A contribution to the _quête_ is\r\ngreeted with the cry of ‘Largess!’ and a churl is liable to have the\r\nground before his door ploughed up. Of old the profits of the _quête_\r\nor ‘plow-gadrin’ went into the parish chest, or as in Norfolk kept a\r\n‘plow-light’ burning in the church. A sixteenth century pamphlet speaks\r\nof the ‘sensing the Ploughess’ on Plough Monday. Jevons, 247, calls the\r\nrite a ‘worship of the plough’; probably it rather represents an early\r\nspring perambulation of the fields in which the divinity rode upon a\r\nplough, as elsewhere upon a ship. A ploughing custom of putting a loaf\r\nin the furrow has been noted. Plough Monday has also its water rite.\r\nThe returning ploughman was liable to be soused by the women, like the\r\nbearer of the ‘neck’ at harvest. Elsewhere, the women must get the\r\nkettle on before the ploughman can reach the hearth, or pay forfeit.\r\n\r\n[736] Printed by Mrs. Chaworth Musters in _A Cavalier Stronghold_\r\n(1890), 388, and in a French translation by Mrs. H. G. M.\r\nMurray-Aynsley, in _R. d. T. P._ iv. 605.\r\n\r\n[737] ‘Hopper Joe’ also calls himself ‘old Sanky-Benny,’ which invites\r\ninterpretation. Is it ‘Saint Bennet’ or ‘Benedict’?\r\n\r\n[738]\r\n\r\n    ‘In comes I, Beelzebub,\r\n    On my shoulder I carry my club,\r\n    In my hand a wet leather frying-pan;\r\n    Don’t you think I’m a funny old man?’\r\n\r\nCf. the St. George play (p. 214).\r\n\r\n[739] ‘Dame Jane’ says,\r\n\r\n    ‘My head is made of iron,\r\n    My body made of steel,\r\n    My hands and feet of knuckle-bone,\r\n    I think nobody can make me feel.’\r\n\r\nIn the Lincolnshire play Beelzebub has this vaunt. Cf. the St. George\r\nplay (p. 220).\r\n\r\n[740] The Doctor can cure ‘the hipsy-pipsy, palsy, and the gout’; cf.\r\nthe St. George play (p. 213).\r\n\r\n[741] Printed in French by Mrs. Murray Aynsley in _R. d. T. P._ iv. 609.\r\n\r\n[742] The farce recorded as occasionally introduced at Whitby (cf. p.\r\n192, n. 1) but not described, probably belonged to the ‘popular’ type.\r\n\r\n[743] Chambers, _Popular Rhymes of Scotland_, 169, prints a Peebles\r\nversion. Instead of George, a hero called Galatian fights the Black\r\nKnight. Judas, with his bag, replaces Beelzebub. But it is the same\r\nplay. Versions or fragments of it are found all over the Lowlands.\r\nThe performers are invariably called ‘guizards.’ In a Falkirk version\r\nthe hero is Prince George of Ville. Hone, _E. D. B._, says that the\r\nhero is sometimes Galacheus or St. Lawrence. But in another Falkirk\r\nversion, part of which he prints, the name is Galgacus, and of this\r\nboth Galacheus and Galatian are probably corruptions, for Galgacus or\r\nCalgacus was the leader of the Picts in their battle with Agricola at\r\nthe Mons Graupius (A. D. 84; Tacitus, _Agricola_, 29).\r\n\r\n[744] Appendix K. Other versions may be conveniently compared in Manly,\r\ni. 289; Ditchfield, 310. The best discussions of the St. George plays\r\nin general, besides Mr. Ordish’s, are J. S. Udall, _Christmas Mummers\r\nin Dorsetshire_ (_F. L. R._ iii. 1. 87); Jackson and Burne, 482; G. L.\r\nGomme, _Christmas Mummers_ (_Nature_, Dec. 23, 1897). The notes and\r\nintroductions to the versions tabulated above give many useful data.\r\n\r\n[745] In _F. L._ x. 351, Miss Florence Grove describes some Christmas\r\nmummers seen at Mullion, Cornwall, in 1890-1. ‘Every one naturally\r\nknows who the actors are, since there are not more than a few hundred\r\npersons within several miles; but no one is supposed to know who\r\nthey are or where they come from, nor must any one speak to them,\r\nnor they to those in the houses they visit. As far as I can remember\r\nthe performance is silent and dramatic; I have no recollection of\r\nreciting.’ The dumb show is rare and probably a sign of decadence, but\r\nthe bit of rural etiquette is archaic and recurs in savage drama.\r\n\r\n[746] In Berkshire and at Eccleshall, Slasher is ‘come from Turkish\r\nland.’ On the other hand, the two often appear in the same version, and\r\neven, as at Leigh, fight together.\r\n\r\n[747] Burne-Jackson, 483.\r\n\r\n[748] Ibid. 483. He appears in the MSS. written by the actors as\r\n‘Singuy’ or ‘Singhiles.’ Professor Skeat points out that, as he ‘sprang\r\nfrom English ground,’ St. Guy (of Warwick) was probably the original\r\nform, and St. Giles a corruption.\r\n\r\n[749] Here may be traced the influence of the Napoleonic wars. In\r\nBerkshire, Slasher is a ‘French officer.’\r\n\r\n[750] _F. L._ v. 88.\r\n\r\n[751] Ditchfield, 12.\r\n\r\n[752] Sandys, 153.\r\n\r\n[753] P. Tennant, _Village Notes_, 179.\r\n\r\n[754] Beelzebub appears also in the Cropwell Plough Monday play; cf.\r\np. 209. Doubtless he once wore a calf-skin, like other rural ‘Fools,’\r\nbut, as far as I know, this feature has dropped out. Sandys, 154,\r\nhowever, quotes ‘Captain Calf-tail’ as the name of the ‘Fool’ in an\r\neighteenth-century Scotch version, and Mr. Gomme (_Nature_, Dec. 23,\r\n1897), says ‘some of the mummers, or maskers as the name implies,\r\nformerly disguised themselves as animals--goats, oxen, deer, foxes\r\nand horses being represented at different places where details of the\r\nmumming play have been recorded.’ Nowadays, Beelzebub generally carries\r\na club and a ladle or frying-pan, with which he makes the _quête_. At\r\nNewport and Eccleshall he has a bell fastened on his back; at Newbold\r\nhe has a black face. The ‘Fool’ figured in the Manchester chap-book\r\nresembles Punch.\r\n\r\n[755] See notes to Steyning play in _F. L. J._ ii. 1.\r\n\r\n[756] Mr. Gomme, in _Nature_ for Dec. 23, 1897, finds in this broom\r\n‘the magic weapon of the witch’ discussed by Pearson, ii. 29. Probably,\r\nhowever, it was introduced into the plays for the purposes of the\r\n_quête_; cf. p. 217. It is used also to make a circle for the players,\r\nbut here it may have merely taken the place of a sword.\r\n\r\n[757] Parish, _Dict. of Sussex Dialect_, 136. The mummers are called\r\n‘John Jacks.’\r\n\r\n[758] Cf. p. 268, n. 4.\r\n\r\n[759] Sandys, 301.\r\n\r\n[760] Cf. Capulet, in _Romeo and Juliet_, i. 5. 28 ‘A hall, a hall!\r\ngive room! and foot it, girls’; and Puck who precedes the dance of\r\nfairies in _Midsummer Night’s Dream_, v. 1. 396\r\n\r\n    ‘I am sent with broom before,\r\n    To sweep the dust behind the door.’\r\n\r\n[761] Ditchfield, 315. ‘The play in this village is performed in most\r\napproved fashion, as the Rector has taken the matter in hand, coached\r\nthe actors in their parts, and taught them some elocution.’ This sort\r\nof thing, of course, is soon fatal to folk-drama.\r\n\r\n[762] Burne-Jackson, 484; Manly, i. 289.\r\n\r\n[763] Burne-Jackson, 402, 410; _F. L._ iv. 162; Dyer, 504. The broom\r\nis used in Christmas and New Year _quêtes_ in Scotland and Yorkshire,\r\neven when there is no drama. Northall 205, gives a Lancashire Christmas\r\nsong, sung by ‘Little David Doubt’ with black face, skin coat and\r\nbroom. At Bradford they ‘sweep out the Old Year’; at Wakefield they\r\nsweep up dirty hearths. In these cases the notion of threatening to do\r\nthe unlucky thing has gone.\r\n\r\n[764] Ditchfield, 12. An ‘Old Bet’ is mentioned in 5 _N. Q._ iv. 511,\r\nas belonging to a Belper version. The woman is worked in with various\r\ningenuity, but several versions have lost her. The prologue to the\r\nNewcastle chap-book promises a ‘Dives’ who never appears. Was this the\r\nwoman? In the Linton in Craven sword-dance, she has the similar name of\r\n‘Miser.’\r\n\r\n[765] I hardly like to trace a reminiscence of the connexion with\r\nthe _renouveau_ in the ‘General Valentine’ and ‘Colonel Spring’ who\r\nfight and are slain in the Dorset (A) version; but there the names\r\nare. Mr. Gomme (_Nature_ for Dec. 23, 1897) finds in certain mumming\r\ncostumes preserved in the Anthropological Museum at Cambridge and made\r\nof paper scales, a representation of leaves of trees. Mr. Ordish, I\r\nbelieve, finds in them the scales of the dragon (_F. L._ iv. 163). Some\r\nscepticism may be permitted as to these conjectures. In most places\r\nthe dress represents little but rustic notions of the ornamental.\r\nCf. Thomas Hardy, _The Return of the Native_, bk. ii. ch. 3: ‘The\r\ngirls could never be brought to respect tradition in designing and\r\ndecorating the armour: they insisted on attaching loops and bows of\r\nsilk and velvet in any situation pleasing to their taste. Gorget,\r\ngusset, bassinet, cuirass, gauntlet, sleeve, all alike in the view\r\nof these feminine eyes were practicable spaces whereon to sew scraps\r\nof fluttering colour.’ The usual costume of the sword-dancers, as we\r\nhave seen (p. 200), was a clean white smock, and probably that of the\r\nmummers is based upon this.\r\n\r\n[766] T. F. Ordish, in _F. L._ iv. 158.\r\n\r\n[767] Printed in _The Old English Drama_ (1830), vol. iii.\r\nBurne-Jackson, 490, think that ‘the masque owes something to the\r\nplay,’ but the resemblances they trace are infinitesimal. A play of\r\n_St. George for England_, by William or Wentworth Smith, was amongst\r\nthe manuscripts destroyed by Warburton’s cook, and a Bartholomew Fair\r\n‘droll’ of _St. George and the Dragon_ is alluded to in the _Theatre of\r\nCompliments_, 1688 (Fleay, _C. H._ ii. 251; Hazlitt, _Manual_, 201).\r\n\r\n[768] In the Dorset (A) version, the king of Egypt is ‘Anthony’ and\r\nthe doctor ‘Mr. Martin Dennis.’ Conceivably these are reminiscences\r\nof St. Anthony of Padua and St. Denys of France. The Revesby Plough\r\nMonday play (cf. p. 208) has also an ‘Anthony.’ The ‘Seven Champions’\r\ndo not appear in the English sword-dances described in ch. ix, but the\r\nmorris-dancers at Edgemond wake used to take that name (Burne-Jackson,\r\n491). Mrs. Nina Sharp writes in _F. L. R._ iii. 1. 113: ‘I was staying\r\nat Minety, near Malmesbury, in Wilts (my cousin is the vicar), when\r\nthe mummers came round (1876). They went through a dancing fight in\r\ntwo lines opposed to each other--performed by the Seven Champions of\r\nChristendom. There was no St. George, and they did not appear to have\r\nheard of the Dragon. When I inquired for him, they went through the\r\nperformance of drawing a tooth--the tooth produced, after great agony,\r\nbeing a horse’s. The mummers then carried into the hall a bush gaily\r\ndecorated with coloured ribbons.... [They] were all in white smock\r\nfrocks and masks. At Acomb, near York, I saw very similar mummers a\r\nfew years ago, but they distinguished St. George, and the Dragon was\r\na prominent person. There was the same tooth-drawing, and I think the\r\nDragon was the patient, and was brought back to life by the operation.’\r\nI wonder whether the ‘Seven Champions’ were _named_ or whether Mrs.\r\nSharp _inferred them_. Anyhow, there could not have been _seven_ at\r\nMinety, without St. George. The ‘bush’ is an interesting feature.\r\nAccording to C. R. Smith, _Isle of Wight Words_ (_Eng. Dial. Soc._\r\nxxxii. 63) the mummers are known in Kent as the ‘Seven Champions.’\r\n\r\n[769] Entered on the _Stationers’ Registers_ in 1596. The first extant\r\nedition is dated 1597. Johnson first introduced Sabra, princess of\r\nEgypt, into the story; in the mediaeval versions, the heroine is an\r\nunnamed princess of Silena in Libya. The mummers’ play follows Johnson,\r\nand makes it Egypt. On Johnson was based Heylin’s _History of St.\r\nGeorge_ (1631 and 1633), and on one or both of these Kirke’s play.\r\n\r\n[770] Jackson and Burne, 489: ‘Miss L.

She was in his mouth, but made the\r\nsign of the cross, and he burst asunder.\r\n\r\n[774] Cf. p. 177.\r\n\r\n[775] Kelly, 37. The ‘dressyng of the dragon’ appears in the town\r\naccounts for 1536. The guild had dropped the riding, even before the\r\nReformation.\r\n\r\n[776] Harris, 97, 190, 277; Kelly, 41. The guild was formed by\r\njourneymen in 1424. Probably there was a riding. In any case, at the\r\nvisit of Prince Edward in 1474, there was a pageant or _mystère mimé_\r\n‘upon the Conddite in the Crosse Chepyng’ of ‘seint George armed and\r\nKynges dought^r knelyng afore hym w^t a lambe and the fader and the\r\nmoder beyng in a toure a boven beholdyng seint George savyng their\r\ndought^r from the dragon.’ There was a similar pageant at the visit of\r\nPrince Arthur in 1498.\r\n\r\n[777] Kelly, 42.\r\n\r\n[778] Morris, 139, 168; Fenwick, _Hist. of Chester_, 372; Dyer, 195.\r\nThe Fraternity of St. George was founded for the encouragement of\r\nshooting in 1537. They had a chapel with a George in the choir of St.\r\nPeter’s. St. George’s was the great day for races on the Rooddee.\r\nIn 1610 was a famous show, wherein St. George was attended by Fame,\r\nMercury, and various allegorical figures.\r\n\r\n[779] Cf. _Representations_, s. v. York, Dublin.\r\n\r\n[780] Dyer, 194, gives from Coates, _Hist. of Reading_, 221, the\r\naccount for setting-up a ‘George’ in 1536. Dugdale, _Hist. of\r\nWarwickshire_, 928, has a notice of a legacy in 1526 by John Arden to\r\nAston church of his ‘white harneis ... for a George to were it, and to\r\nstand on his pewe, a place made for it.’\r\n\r\n[781] R. W. Goulding, _Louth Records_, quotes from the churchwardens’\r\naccounts for 1538 payments for taking down the image of St. George and\r\nhis horse.\r\n\r\n[782] _Representations_, s. v. Windsor, Lydd, New Romney, Bassingbourne.\r\n\r\n[783] For the legend, see _Acta Sanctorum_, _April_, iii. 101; Jacobus\r\nà Voragine, _Legenda Aurea_ (1280), lviii; E. A. W. Budge, _The\r\nMartyrdom and Miracles of St. George of Cappadocia: the Coptic Texts_\r\n(Oriental Text Series, 1888). In Rudder, _Hist. of Gloucestershire_,\r\n461, and _Gloucester F. L._ 47, is printed an English version of the\r\nlegend, apparently used for reading in church on the Sunday preceding\r\nSt. George’s day, April 23. Cf. also Gibbon (ed. Bury), ii. 472, 568;\r\nHartland, _Perseus_, iii. 38; Baring-Gould, _Curious Myths of the\r\nMiddle Ages_, 266; Zöckler, s. v. St. Georg, in Herzog and Plitt’s\r\n_Encyclopedia_; F. Görres, _Ritter St. Georg in Geschichte, Legende und\r\nKunst, in Zeitschrift für wissenschaftliche Theologie_, xxx (1887),\r\n54; F. Vetter, _Introduction_ to Reimbot von Durne’s _Der heilige\r\nGeorg_ (1896). Gibbon identified St. George with the Arian bishop\r\nGeorge of Cappadocia, and the dragon with Athanasius. This view has\r\nbeen recently revived with much learning by J. Friedrich in _Sitzb.\r\nAkad. Wiss. München_ (_phil.-hist. Kl._), 1899, ii. 2. Pope Gelasius\r\n(†495) condemned the _Passio_ as apocryphal and heretical, but he\r\nadmits the historical existence of the saint, whose cult indeed was\r\nwell established both in East and West in the fifth century. Budge\r\ntries to find an historical basis for him in a young man at Nicomedia\r\nwho tore down an edict during the persecution of Diocletian (†303), and\r\nidentifies his torturer Dadianus with the co-emperor Galerius.\r\n\r\n[784] Du Méril, _La Com._ 98. He quotes Novidius, _Sacri Fasti_ (ed.\r\n1559), bk. vi. f. 48^{vo}:\r\n\r\n    ‘perque annos duci monet [rex] in spectacula casum\r\n      unde datur multis annua scena locis.’\r\n\r\nA fifteenth-century Augsburg miracle-play of St. George is printed by\r\nKeller, _Fastnachtsspiele_, No. 125; for other Continental data cf.\r\nCreizenach, i. 231, 246; Julleville, _Les Myst._ ii. 10, 644; D’Ancona,\r\ni. 104.\r\n\r\n[785] Rabelais, _Gargantua_, iv. 59. The dragon was called Graoully,\r\nand snapped its jaws, like the Norwich ‘snap-dragons’ and the English\r\nhobby-horse.\r\n\r\n[786] Cf. p. 138. The myth has attached itself to other undoubtedly\r\nhistorical persons besides St. George (Bury, _Gibbon_, ii. 569). In\r\nhis case it is possibly due to a misunderstood bit of rhetoric. In the\r\nCoptic version of the legend edited by Budge (p. 223), Dadianus is\r\ncalled ‘the dragon of the abyss.’ There is no literal dragon in this\r\nversion: the princess is perhaps represented by Alexandra, the wife of\r\nDadianus, whom George converts. Cf. Hartland, _Perseus_, iii. 44.\r\n\r\n[787] Cf. ch. xxiv, as to these plays.\r\n\r\n[788] I ought perhaps to say that in one of the Coptic versions of the\r\nlegend St. George is periodically slain and brought back to life by a\r\nmiracle during the space of seven years. But I do not think that this\r\nepisode occurs in any of the European versions of the legend.\r\n\r\n[789] ‘Sant George and the dragon’ are introduced into a London\r\nMay-game in 1559 (ch. viii).\r\n\r\n[790] See the Manchester _Peace Egg_ chap-book. At Manchester,\r\nLangdale, and, I believe, Coniston, the play is performed at Easter:\r\ncf. Halliwell, _Popular Rhymes_, 231. The Steyning play is believed\r\nto have been given at May-day as well as Christmas. Of course, so far\r\nas this goes, the transference might have been from Christmas, not to\r\nChristmas, but the German analogies point the other way. The Cheshire\r\nperformance on All Souls’ Day (Nov. 2), mentioned by Child, v. 291, is,\r\nso far as I know, exceptional.\r\n\r\n[791] Cf. ch. xvii: In the Isle of Wight the performers are called\r\nthe ‘Christmas Boys’ (C. R. Smith, _Isle of Wight Words_, in _E. D.\r\nS._ xxxii. 63). The terms ‘Seven Champions’ (Kent) and ‘John Jacks’\r\n(Salisbury) have already been explained. The Steyning ‘Tipteers’ or\r\n‘Tipteerers’ may be named from the ‘tips’ collected in the _quête_.\r\nThe ‘Guisers’ of Staffordshire become on the Shropshire border\r\n‘Morris-dancers,’ ‘Murry-dancers,’ or ‘Merry-dancers’--a further proof\r\nof the essential identity of the morris- or sword-dance with the play.\r\n\r\n[792] Tille, _Y. and C._ 78, 107; Rhys, _C. H._ 519; cf. ch. v.\r\n\r\n[793] Tille, _Y. and C._ 18; _D. W._ 6. Bede, _D. T. R._ 15, gives\r\nBlot-monath as the Anglo-Saxon name for November, and explains it as\r\n‘mensis immolationum, quia in ea pecora quae occisuri erant, Diis suis\r\nvoverent.’\r\n\r\n[794] Burton, 15, notes a tradition at Disley, in Cheshire, that the\r\nlocal wake was formerly held after the first fall of snow.\r\n\r\n[795] Tille, _Y. and C._ 18.\r\n\r\n[796] Mogk, iii. 391; Tille, _Y. and C._ 24, find the winter feast\r\nin the festival of Tanfana which the Marsi were celebrating when\r\nGermanicus attacked them in A. D. 14 (Tacitus, _Ann._ i. 51). Winter,\r\nthough imminent, had not yet actually set in, but this might be the\r\ncase in any year after the festival had come to be determined by a\r\nfixed calendar.\r\n\r\n[797] Tille, _Y. and C._ 57.\r\n\r\n[798] Rhys, _C. H._ 513, says that the _Samhain_ fell on Nov. 1. The\r\npreceding night was known as _Nos Galan-geaf_, the ‘night of winter\r\ncalends,’ and that following as _Dy’ gwyl y Meirw_, ‘the feast of the\r\nDead.’ In _F. L._ ii. 308 he gives the date of the Manx _Samhain_ as\r\nNov. 12, and explains this as being Nov. 1, O. S. But is it not really\r\nthe original date of the feast which has been shifted elsewhere to the\r\nbeginning of the month?\r\n\r\n[799] Tille, _Y. and C._ 12, citing M. Heyne, _Ulfilas_, 226: ‘In a\r\nGothic _calendarium_ of the sixth century November, or _Naubaímbaír_,\r\nis called _fruma Iiuleis_, which presupposes that December was called\r\n*_aftuma Iiuleis_.’\r\n\r\n[800] Bede, _de temp. rat._ c. 15. Tille, _Y. and C._ 20, points out\r\nthat the application of the old tide-name to fit November and December\r\nby the Goths and December and January by the Anglo-Saxons is fair\r\nevidence for the belief that the tide itself corresponded to a period\r\nfrom mid-November to mid-January.\r\n\r\n[801] Tille, _Y. and C._ 147. The terms _gehhol_, _geóhel_, _geól_,\r\n_giúl_, _iûl_, &c. signify the Christmas festival season from the ninth\r\ncentury onwards, and from the eleventh also Christmas Day itself. The\r\nfifteenth-century forms are _Yule_, _Ywle_, _Yole_, _Yowle_. In the\r\nA.-S. Chronicle the terms used for Christmas are ‘midewinter,’ ‘Cristes\r\nmæssa,’ ‘Cristes tyde,’ ‘Natiuitedh.’ As a single word ‘Cristesmesse’\r\nappears first in 1131 (Tille, _Y. and C._ 159). The German ‘Weihnacht’\r\n(M.H.G. _wich_, ‘holy’) appears †1000 (Tille, _D. W._ 22).\r\n\r\n[802] Pfannenschmidt, 238, 512.\r\n\r\n[803] The notion is of a circular course of the sun, passing through\r\nthe four turning- or wheeling-points of the solstices and equinoxes. Cf.\r\nch. vi for the use of the wheel as a solar symbol.\r\n\r\n[804] Mogk, iii. 391, quoting Kluge, _Englische Studien_, ix. 311, and\r\nBugge, _Ark. f. nord. Filolog._ iv. 135. Tille, _Y. and C._ 8, 148,\r\ndesirous to establish an Oriental origin for the Three Score Day tides,\r\ndoubts the equation *_jehwela_ = _ioculus_, and suggests a connexion\r\nbetween the Teutonic terms and the old Cypriote names ἰλαῖος, ἰουλαῖος,\r\nἰουλίηος, ἰούλιος for the period Dec. 22 to Jan. 23 (K. F. Hermann,\r\n_Über griech. Monatskunde_, 64), and, more hesitatingly, with the Greek\r\nἼουλος or hymn to Ceres. Weinhold, _Deutsche Monatsnamen_, 4; _Deutsche\r\nJahrteilung_, 15, thinks that both the Teutonic and Cypriote names are\r\nthe Roman _Julius_ transferred from mid-summer to mid-winter. Northall,\r\n208, makes _yule_ = _ol_, _oel_, a feast or ‘ale,’ for which I suppose\r\nthere is nothing to be said. Skeat, _Etym. Dict._ s. v., makes it ‘a\r\ntime of revelry,’ and connects with M.E. _youlen_, _yollen_, to ‘yawl’\r\nor ‘yell,’ and with A.-S. _gýlan_, Dutch _joelen_, to make merry, G.\r\n_jolen_, _jodeln_, to sing out. He thus gets in a different way much\r\nthe sense given in the text.\r\n\r\n[805] At a Cotswold Whitsun ale a lord and lady ‘of yule’ were chosen\r\n(_Gloucester F. L._ 56). Rhys, _C. H._ 412, 421, 515, and in _F. L._\r\nii. 305, gives _Gwyl_ as a Welsh term for ‘feast’ in general, and in\r\nparticular mentions, besides the _Gwyl y Meirw_ at the _Samhain_,\r\nthe _Gwyl Aust_ (Aug. 1, Lammas or Lugnassad Day). This also appears\r\nin Latin as the _Gula Augusti_ (Ducange, s. v. temp. Edw. III), and\r\nin English as ‘the Gule of August’ (Hearne, _Robert of Gloucester’s\r\nChron._ 679). Tille, _Y. and C._ 56, declares that _Gula_ here is only\r\na mutilation of _Vincula_, Aug. 1 being in the ecclesiastical calendar\r\nthe feast of St. Peter _ad Vincula_.\r\n\r\n[806] Kluge and Lutz, _English Etymology_, s. v. Yule.\r\n\r\n[807] Bede, _D. T. R._ c. 15 ‘ipsam noctem nobis sacrosanctam, tunc\r\ngentili vocabulo _Modranicht_ [v.l. _Modraneht_], id est, matrum\r\nnoctem appellabant; ob causam ut suspicamur ceremoniarum, quas in ea\r\npervigiles agebant.’\r\n\r\n[808] Mogk, iii. 391. Tille, _Y. and C._ 152, gives some earlier\r\nexplanations, criticizes that of Mogk, and offers as his own a\r\nreference to a custom of baking a cake (_placenta_) to represent the\r\nphysical motherhood of the Virgin. The practice doubtless existed and\r\nwas condemned by Pope Hormisdas (514-23), by the Lateran Council of\r\n649, the Council of Hatfield (680), and the Trullan Council (692).\r\nBut Bede must have known this as a Christian abuse, and he is quite\r\nplainly speaking of a pre-Christian custom. J. M. Neale, _Essays in\r\nLiturgiology_ (1867), 511, says, ‘In most Celtic languages Christmas\r\neve is called the night of Mary,’ the Virgin, here as elsewhere, taking\r\nover the cult of the mother-goddesses.\r\n\r\n[809] Tille, _Y. and C._ 65. In his earlier book _D. W._ 7, 29, Dr.\r\nTille held the view that there had always been a second winter feast\r\nabout three weeks after the first, when the males held over for\r\nbreeding were slain.\r\n\r\n[810] According to Bede, _D. T. R._ c. 15, the Anglo-Saxons had adopted\r\nthe system of intercalary months which belongs to the pre-Julian\r\nand not the Julian Roman calendar. But Bede’s chapter is full of\r\nconfusions: cf. Tille, _Y. and C._ 145.\r\n\r\n[811] All Saints’ day or Hallowmas (November 1) and All Souls’ day\r\n(November 2) have largely, though not wholly, absorbed the November\r\nfeast of the Dead.\r\n\r\n[812] Pfannenschmidt, 203; Jahn, 229; Tille, _Y. and C._ 21, 28, 36,\r\n42, 57; _D. W._ 23.\r\n\r\n[813] Tille, _D. W._ 29; Müller, 239, 248. According to Tille, _D. W._\r\n63, Christmas only replaced the days of St. Martin and St. Nicholas as\r\na German children’s festival in the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\n[814] Tille, _Y. and C._ 34, 65; Pfannenschmidt, 206; Dyer, 418;\r\nN. Drake, _Shakespeare and his Times_ (1838), 93. Martinmas was a\r\nfavourite Anglo-Saxon and mediaeval legal term. It survived also as\r\na traditional ‘tyme of slauchter’ for cattle. ‘Martlemas beef’ was a\r\ncommon term for salt beef. In Scotland a Mart is a fat cow or bullock,\r\nbut the derivation of this appears to be from a Celtic word _Mart_ =\r\ncow.\r\n\r\n[815] Rhys, in _F. L._ ii. 308.\r\n\r\n[816] Mommsen, _C. I.

An\r\nearlier cult of the same type introduced by Elagabalus did not survive\r\nits founder.\r\n\r\n[820] The earliest reference is probably that in the calendar of the\r\nGreek astronomer, of uncertain date, Antiochus, Ἡλίου γενέθλιον·\r\nαὔξει φῶς (Cumont, i. 342, from _Cod. Monac._ gr. 287, f. 132). The\r\n_Fasti_ of Furius Dionysius Philocalus (A.D. 354) have ‘VIII. KAL. IAN.\r\nN[atalis] INVICTI C[ircenses] M[issus] XXX’ (_C. I. L._ i^2. 278, 338).\r\nCf.

Mithra was originally a form of the Aryan Sun-god, who\r\nthough subordinated in the Mazdean system to Ahoura Mazda continued to\r\nbe worshipped by the Persian folk. His cult made its appearance in Rome\r\nabout 70 B.C., and was developed during the third and fourth centuries\r\nA.D. under philosophic influences. Mithra was regarded as the fount\r\nof all life, and the yearly obscuration of the sun’s forces in winter\r\nbecame a hint and promise of immortality to his worshippers: cf. _Carm.\r\nadv. paganos_, 47 ‘qui hibernum docuit sub terra quaerere solem.’\r\nMithraic votive stones have been found in all parts of the empire,\r\nBritain included. They are inscribed ‘Soli Invicto,’ ‘Deo Soli Invicto\r\nMithrae,’ ‘Numini Invicto Soli Mithrae,’ and the like.\r\n\r\n[823] Cumont, _Textes et Mon._ i. 325; ii. 66, and in Roscher’s\r\n_Lexicon_, ii. 3065; Lichtenberger, _Encycl. des Sciences religieuses_,\r\ns. v.

Jacobitz, iii. 307; _Saturnalia_, p.\r\n393) in the mouth of the divinely instructed νομοθέτης, Chronosolon,\r\nand in the ‘Letters of Saturn’ that follow.\r\n\r\n[827] According to Tacitus, _Ann._ xiii. 15, Nero was king of the\r\nSaturnalia at the time of the murder of Britannicus. On the nature of\r\nthis sovereignty, cf. Arrian, _Epictetus_, i. 25; Martial, xi. 6:\r\n\r\n    ‘unctis falciferi senis diebus,\r\n    regnator quibus imperat fritillus.’\r\n\r\nLucian, _Saturnalia_, p. 385, introduces a dialogue between Saturn\r\nand his priests. Saturn says ἑπτὰ μὲν ἡμερῶν ἡ πᾶσα βασιλεία, καὶ\r\nἢν ἐκπρόθεσμος τούτων γένωμαι, ἰδιώτης εὐθύς εἰμι, καὶ τοῦ πολλοῦ\r\nδήμου εἷσ· ἐν αὐταῖς δέ ταῖς ἑπτὰ σπουδαῖον μὲν οὐδὲν οὐδὲ ἀγοραῖον\r\nδιοικήσασθαί μοι συγκεχώρηται, πίνειν δὲ καὶ μεθύειν καὶ βοᾶν καὶ\r\nπαίζειν καὶ κυβεύειν καὶ ἄρχοντας καθίσταναι καὶ τοὺς οἰκέτας εὐωχεῖν\r\nκαὶ γυμνὸν ἄδειν καὶ κροτεῖν ὑποτρέμοντα, ἐνίοτε δὲ καὶ ἐς ὕδωρ\r\nψυχρὸν ἐπὶ κεφαλὴν ὠθεῖσθαι ἀσβόλῳ κεχρισμένον τὸ πρόσωπον, ταῦτα\r\nἐφεῖταί μοι ποιεῖν; and again: εὐωχώμεθα δὲ ἤδη καὶ κροτῶμεν καὶ ἐπὶ\r\nτῆ ἑορτῆ ἐλευθεριάζωμεν, εἲτα πεττεύωμεν ἐς τὸ ἀρχαῖον ἐπὶ καρύων καὶ\r\nβασιλέας χειροτονῶμεν καὶ πειθαρχῶμεν αὐτοῖσ· οὕτω γὰρ ἂν τὴν παροιμίαν\r\nἐπαληθεύσαιμι, ἥ φησι, παλίμπαιδας τοὺς γέροντας γίγνεσθαι. The ducking\r\nis curiously suggestive of western festival customs, but I do not feel\r\nsure whether it was the image of Saturn that was ducked or the _rex_\r\nwith whom he appears to half, and only half, identify himself. Frazer,\r\niii. 140, lays stress on the primitive sacrificial character of the\r\n‘rex,’ who is said still to have been annually slain in Lower Moesia\r\nat the beginning of the fourth century A.D.; cf. _Acta S. Dasii_, in\r\n_Acta Bollandiana_, xvi. (1897), 5; Parmentier et Cumont, _Le Roi des\r\nSaturnales_, in _R. de Philologie_, xxi (1897), 143.\r\n\r\n[828] Frazer, iii. 144, suggests that the _Saturnalia_ may once have\r\nbeen in February, and have left a trace of themselves in the similar\r\nfestival of the female slaves, the _Matronalia_, on March 1, which,\r\nlike the winter feasts, came in for Christian censure; cf. Appendix N.\r\nNo. (i).\r\n\r\n[829] Preller, _R. M._ i. 64, 178; ii. 13; C.

Lipenius, _Strenarum Historia_ in J. G. Graevius, _Thesaurus\r\nAntiq. Rom._ (1699), xii. 409. The last-named treatise contains a\r\nquantity of information set out with some obsolete learning. The most\r\nimportant contemporary account is that of Libanius (314-†95) in his\r\nείς τὰς καλάνδας and his καλανδῶν ἔκφρασις (ed. Reiske, i. 256; iv.\r\n1053; cf. Sievers, _Das Leben der Libanius_, 170, 204). In the former\r\nspeech he says ταύτην τὴν ἑορτὴν εὔροι τ’ ἂν τεταμένην ἐφ’ ἅπαν, ὅσον ἡ\r\nῬωμαίων ἀρχὴ τέταται, in the latter, μίαν δὲ οἶδα κοινὴν ἁπάντων ὁπόσοι\r\nζῶσιν ὑπὸ τὴν Ῥωμαίων ἀρχήν. Under the emperors, who made much of the\r\n_strenae_ and _vota_, the importance of the Kalends grew, probably at\r\nthe expense of the Saturnalia; cf. Macrobius, _Saturnalia_, i. 2. 1\r\n‘adsunt feriae quas indulget magna pars mensis Iano dicati.’\r\n\r\n[830] Preller, i. 180; Mommsen and Marquardt, vi. 14; vii. 245; W. W.\r\nFowler, 278; Tille, _Y. and C._ 84, 104. _Strenia_ was interpreted in\r\nthe sense of ‘strenuous’; cf. Symmachus, _Epist._ x. 15 ‘ab exortu\r\npaene urbis Martiae strenarum usus adolevit auctore Tatio rege, qui\r\nverbenas felicis arboris ex luco Streniae anni novi auspices primus\r\naccepit.... Nomen indicio est viris strenuis haec convenire virtute.’\r\nPreller calls Strenia a Sabine _Segensgöttin_.\r\n\r\n[831] Mommsen and Marquardt, vii. 245; Lipenius, 489. The gifts were\r\noften inscribed ‘anno novo faustum felix tibi.’ It is probable that\r\nthe sweet cakes and the lamps like the _verbenae_ had originally a\r\ncloser connexion with the rites of the feast than that of mere omens.\r\nThe emperors expected liberal _strenae_, and from them the custom\r\npassed into mediaeval and Renaissance courts. Queen Elizabeth received\r\nsumptuous new year gifts from her subjects. For a money payment the\r\nlater empire used the term καλανδικόν or _kalendaticum_. _Strenae_\r\nsurvives in the French _étrennes_ (Müller, 150, 504).\r\n\r\n[832] Appendix N, Nos.

I have not been\r\nable to see an article praised by Mr. Conybeare, in P. de Lagarde,\r\n_Mittheilungen_ (1890), iv. 241.\r\n\r\n[834] Conybeare, _Am. J. Th._ iii. 7, cites, without giving exact\r\nreferences, two ‘north Italian homilies’ of the fourth century, which\r\nseem to show this.\r\n\r\n[835] _Sermo_ ccii (_P. L._ xxxviii. 1033).\r\n\r\n[836] The _depositio martyrum_, attached to the _Fasti_ of Philocalus\r\ndrawn up in 354, opens with the entry ‘viii kl. ianu. natus Christus\r\nin Bethleem Iudeae.’ December 25 was therefore kept as the birthday\r\nat least as early as 353. Usener, i. 267, argued that the change must\r\nhave taken place in this very year, because Liberius, while veiling\r\nMarcellina, the sister of St. Ambrose, on the Epiphany, spoke of the\r\nday as ‘natalem Sponsi tui’ (_de Virginibus_, iii. 1, in _P. L._ xvi.\r\n219). But it is not proved either that this event took place in 363,\r\nor that it was on Epiphany rather than Christmas day. Liberius refers\r\nto the Marriage at Cana and the Feeding of the Five Thousand. But the\r\nfirst allusion is directly led up to by the _sponsalia_ of Marcellina,\r\nand both events, although at a later date commemorated at Epiphany, may\r\nhave belonged to Christmas at Rome, before Epiphany made its appearance\r\n(Duchesne, _Bulletin critique_ (1890), 41). Usener adds that Liberius\r\nbuilt the _Basilica Liberii_, also known as _Sta. Maria ad Praesepe_ or\r\n_Sta. Maria Maggiore_, which is still a great station for the Christmas\r\nceremonies, in honour of the new feast. But Duchesne shows that the\r\ndedication to St. Mary only dates from a rebuilding in the fifth\r\ncentury, that the _praesepe_ cannot be traced there before the seventh,\r\nand that the original Christmas _statio_ was at St. Peter’s.\r\n\r\n[837] Duchesne, _Bulletin critique_ (1890), 44. This document also\r\nbelongs to the collection of Philocalus.\r\n\r\n[838] Conybeare, _Key of Truth_, clii-clvii, quoting an Armenian bishop\r\nHippolytus in _Bodl. Armen. Marsh_ 467, f. 338^a, ‘as many as were\r\ndisobedient have divided the two feasts.’ According to the _Catechism\r\nof the Syrian Doctors_ in the same MS., Sahak asked Afrem why the\r\nchurches feast Dec. 25: the teacher replied, ‘The Roman world does so\r\nfrom idolatry, because of the worship of the Sun. And on the 25th of\r\nDec., which is the first of Qanûn; when the day made a beginning out\r\nof the darkness they feasted the Sun with great joy, and declared that\r\nday to be the nuptials [? ‘natals,’ but cf. p. 241, n. 1] of the Sun.\r\nHowever, when the Son of God was born of the Virgin, they celebrated\r\nthe same feast, although they had turned from their idols to God. And\r\nwhen their bishops (_or_ primates) saw this, they proceeded to take the\r\nFeast of the Birth of Christ, which was on the sixth of January, and\r\nplaced it there (viz. on Dec. 25). And they abrogated the feast of the\r\nSun, because it (the Sun) was nothing, as we said before.’ Mommsen, _C.\r\nI. L._ i^2. 338, quotes to the same effect another _Scriptor Syrus_ (in\r\nAssemanus, _Bibl. Orient._ ii. 164): cf. p. 235. The early apologists\r\n(Tertullian, _Apol._ 16; _ad Nationes_, i. 13; Origen, _contra Celsum_,\r\nviii. 67) defend Christianity against pagan charges of Sun-worship.\r\n\r\n[839] Conybeare, _J. Am. Th._ iii. 8.\r\n\r\n[840] Most of these dates were in the spring (Duchesne, 247). As\r\nlate as †243 the Pseudo-Cyprianic _de Pascha computus_ gives March\r\n28. On the other hand, December 25 is given early in the third\r\ncentury by Hippolytus, _Comm. super Danielem_, iv. 23 (p. 243, ed.\r\nBonwetsch, 1897), although the text has been suspected of interpolation\r\n(Hilgenfeld, in _Berlin. phil. Wochenschrift_, 1897, p. 1324, s.).\r\nAnanias of Shirak (†600-50), _Hom. de Nat._ (transl. in _Expositor_,\r\nNov. 1890), says that the followers of Cerinthus first separated the\r\nbirth and baptism: cf. Conybeare, _Key of Truth_, cliv. This is further\r\nexplained by Paul of Taron (ob. 1123), _adv. Theopistum_, 222 (quoted\r\nConybeare, clvi), who says that Artemon calculated the dates of the\r\nAnnunciation as March 25 and the Birth as December 25, ‘the birth,\r\nnot however of the Divine Being, but only of the mere man.’ Both\r\nCerinthus (end of 1st cent.) and Artemon (†202-17) appear to have held\r\nAdoptionist tenets: cf. Schaff, iv. 465, 574. Paul adds that Artemon\r\ncalculated the dates from those for the conception and nativity of John\r\nthe Baptist. This implies that St. John Baptist’s day was already June\r\n24 by †200. It was traditional on that day by St. Augustine’s time,\r\n‘Hoc maiorum traditione suscepimus’ (_Sermo_ ccxcii. 1, in Migne, _P.\r\nL._ xxxviii. 1320). The six months’ interval between the two nativities\r\nmay be inferred from _St. Luke_ i. 26. St. Augustine refers to the\r\nsymbolism of their relation to each other, and quotes with regard to\r\ntheir position on the solstices the words ascribed to the Baptist in\r\n_St. John_ iii. 30 ‘illum oportet crescere, me autem minui’ (_Sermo_\r\ncxciv. 2; cclxxxvii. 3; cclxxxviii. 5; Migne, _P. L._ xxxviii. 1016,\r\n1302, 1306). Duchesne, 250, conjectures that the varying dates of West\r\n(Dec. 25) and East (Jan. 6) depended on a similar variation in the date\r\nassigned to the Passion, it being assumed in each case that the life\r\nof Christ must have been a complete circle, and that therefore he must\r\nhave died on the anniversary of his conception in the womb. Thus St.\r\nAugustine (_in Heptat._ ii. 90) upbraids the Jews, ‘non coques agnum in\r\nlacte matris suae.’ March 25 was widely accepted for the Passion from\r\nTertullian onwards, and certain Montanists held to the date of April\r\n6. Astronomy makes it impossible that March 25 can be historically\r\ncorrect, and therefore the whole calculation, if Duchesne is right,\r\nprobably started from an arbitrary identification of a Christian date\r\nwith the spring equinox, just as, if Ananias of Shirak is right, it\r\nstarted from a similar identification of another such date with the\r\nsummer solstice. But it seems just as likely that the birth was fixed\r\nfirst, and the Annunciation and St. John Baptist’s day calculated\r\nback from that. If the Passion had been the starting-point, would not\r\nthe feast of Christmas, as distinct from the traditional date for the\r\nevent, have become a movable one?\r\n\r\n[841] The Armenian criticism just quoted only re-echoes that put by St.\r\nAugustine in the mouth of the Manichaeans in _Contra Faustum_, xx. 4\r\n(_Corp. Script. Eccl._ xxv) ‘Faustus dixit ... solemnes gentium dies\r\ncum ipsis celebratis ut Kalendas et solstitia.’ Augustine answers other\r\ncriticisms of the same order in the course of the book, but he does not\r\ntake up this one.\r\n\r\n[842] Augustine, in his sermons, uses a solar symbolism in two ways,\r\nbesides drawing the parallel with St. John already quoted. Christ is\r\n_lux e tenebris_: ‘quoniam ipsa infidelitas quae totum mundum vice\r\nnoctis obtexerat, minuenda fuerat fide crescente; ideo die Natalis\r\nDomini nostri Iesu Christi, et nox incipit perpeti detrimenta, et dies\r\nsumere augmenta’ (_Sermo_ cxc. 1 in _P. L._ xxxviii. 1007). He is\r\nalso _sponsus procedens de thalamo suo_ (_Sermo_ cxcii. 3; cxcv. 3,\r\nin _P. L._ xxxviii. 1013, 1018). Following this Caesarius or another\r\ncalls Christmas the _dies nuptialis Christi_, on which ‘sponsae suae\r\nEcclesiae adiunctus est’ (_Serm. Pseudo-Aug._ cxvi. 2, in _P. L._\r\nxxxix. 1975). Cumont, i. 355, gives other examples of _Le Soleil\r\nSymbole du Christ_ from an early date, and especially of the use of the\r\nphrase _Sol Iustitiae_ from _Malachi_, iv. 2.\r\n\r\n[843] Pseudo-Chrysostom (Italian, 4th cent.), _de solstitiis et\r\naequinoctiis_ (_Op._ Chrys. ed. 1588, ii. 118) ‘Sed et dominus nascitur\r\nmense Decembri, hiemis tempore, viii kal. Ianuarias.... Sed et invicti\r\nnatalem appellant. Quis utique tam invictus nisi dominus noster qui\r\nMortem subactam devicit? vel quod dicant Solis esse natalem, ipse est\r\nSol iustitiae de quo Malachias propheta dixit’; St. Augustine, _Sermo_\r\ncxc. 1 (_P. L._ xxxviii. 1007) ‘habeamus, igitur, fratres, solemnem\r\nistum diem; non sicut infideles propter hunc solem, sed propter eum qui\r\nfecit hunc solem’; _Tract. in Iohann._ xxxiv. 2 (_P. L._ xxxv. 1652)\r\n‘numquid forte Dominus Christus est Sol iste qui ortu et occasu peragit\r\ndiem? Non enim defuerunt heretici qui ita senserunt ... (c. 4) ne quis\r\ncarnaliter sapiens solem istum intelligendum putaret’; Pseudo-Ambrose\r\n(perhaps Maximus of Turin, †412-65), _Sermo_ vi. (_P. L._ xvii. 614)\r\n‘bene quodammodo sanctum hunc diem natalis Domini solem novum vulgus\r\nappellat ... quod libenter nobis amplectendum est; quia oriente\r\nSalvatore non solum humani generis salus, sed etiam solis ipsius\r\nclaritas innovatur’; Leo Magnus, _Sermo_ xxii, _in Nativ. Dom._ (_P.\r\nL._ liv. 198) ‘Ne idem ille tentator, cuius iam a vobis dominationem\r\nChristus exclusit, aliquibus vos iterum seducat insidiis, et haec\r\nipsa praesentis diei gaudia suae fallaciae arte corrumpat, illudens\r\nsimplicioribus animis de quorumdam persuasione pestifera, quibus haec\r\ndies solemnitatis nostrae non tam de nativitate Christi quam de novi,\r\nut dicunt, solis ortu honorabilis videatur’; _Sermo_ xxvii, _in Nat.\r\nDom._ (_P. L._ liv. 218) ‘De talibus institutis etiam illa generatur\r\nimpietas ut sol in inchoatione diurnae lucis exsurgens a quibusdam\r\ninsipientioribus de locis eminentioribus adoretur; quod nonnulli etiam\r\nChristiani adeo se religiose facere putant, ut priusquam ad B. Petri\r\napostoli basilicam, quae uni Deo vivo et vero est dedicata, perveniant,\r\nsuperatis gradibus quibus ad suggestum areae superioris ascenditur,\r\nconverso corpore ad nascentem se solem reflectant, et curvatis\r\ncervicibus, in honorem se splendidi orbis inclinent. Quod fieri partim\r\nignorantiae vitio, partim paganitatis spiritu, multum tabescimus et\r\ndolemus.’ Eusebius, _Sermo_ xxii. περὶ ἀστρονόμων (_P. G._ lxxxvi.\r\n453), also refers to the adoration of the sun by professing Christians.\r\nThe ‘tentator’ of Leo and the ‘heretici’ of Augustine are probably\r\nManichaeus and his followers, against whose sun-worship Augustine\r\nargues at length in _Contra Faustum_, xx (_Corp. Script. Eccl._ xxv).\r\n\r\n[844] Duchesne, 248.\r\n\r\n[845] Cf. p. 14.\r\n\r\n[846] _C. Agathense_, c. 21 (Mansi, viii. 328) ‘Pascha vero, natale\r\ndomini, epiphania, ascensionem domini, pentecostem, et natalem S.\r\nIoannis Baptistae, vel si qui maximi dies in festivitatibus habentur,\r\nnon nisi in civitatibus aut in parochiis teneant.’\r\n\r\n[847] _Conc. Bracarense_ (†560), Prop. 4 (Mansi, ix. 775) ‘Si quis\r\nnatalem Christi secundum carnem non bene honorat, sed honorare se\r\nsimulat, ieiunans in eodem die, et in dominico; quia Christum in\r\nvera hominis natura natum esse non credit, sicut Cerdon, Marcion,\r\nManichaeus, et Priscillianus, anathema sit.’ A similar prohibition\r\nis given by Gregory II (†725), _Capitulare_, c. 10 (_P. L._ lxxxix.\r\n534). To failings in the opposite direction the Church was more\r\ntender: cf. _Penitentiale Theodori_ (Haddan and Stubbs, iii. 177),\r\n_de Crapula et Ebrietate_ ‘Si vero pro infirmitate aut quia longo\r\ntempore se abstinuerit, et in consuetudine non erit ei multum bibere\r\nvel manducare, aut pro gaudio in Natale Domini aut in Pascha aut pro\r\nalicuius Sanctorum commemoratione faciebat, et tunc plus non accipit\r\nquam decretum est a senioribus, nihil nocet.

It cannot of course\r\nbe positively said whether the Epiphany fires and some of the other\r\nagricultural rites to be presently mentioned (ch. xii) came from the\r\nNovember or the ploughing festival.\r\n\r\n[860] _C. of Auxerre_ (573-603), c. 11 (Appendix N. No. xxv).\r\n\r\n[861] In the south of France Christmas is _Chalendes_, in Provence\r\n_Calendas_ or _Calenos_. The log is _calignau_, _chalendau_,\r\n_chalendal_, _calignaon_, or _culenos_, and the peasants sang round it\r\n‘Calène vient’ (Tille, _D. W._ 286; Müller, 475, 478). Thiers, i. 264,\r\nspeaks of ‘le pain de Calende.’ Christmas songs used to be known in\r\nSilesia as _Kolendelieder_ (Tille, _D. W._ 287). The Lithuanian term\r\nfor Christmas is _Kalledos_ and the Czechic _Koleda_ (Polish _Kolenda_,\r\nRussian _Koljada_). A verb _colendisare_ appears as a Bohemian law term\r\n(Tille, _Y. and C._ 84); while in the fourteenth century the Christmas\r\n_quête_ at Prague was known as the _Koledasammeln_ (Tille, _D. W._\r\n112). The Bohemian Christmas procession described by Alsso (cf. ch.\r\nxii) was called _Calendizatio_, and according to tradition St. Adalbert\r\n(tenth century) transferred it from the Kalends to Christmas, and\r\ncalled it _colendizatio_ ‘_a colendo_.’\r\n\r\n[862] _C. of Auxerre_ (573-603), c. 5 (Appendix N, No. xxv).\r\nPfannenschmidt, 498, has collected a number of notices of _Martinalia_\r\nfrom the tenth century onwards.\r\n\r\n[863] Pfannenschmidt, 279; Dyer, 386, describe the ‘Horn Fair’ at\r\nCharlton, Kent, on St. Luke’s Day, Oct. 18. A king and queen were\r\nchosen, who went in procession to the church, wearing horns. The\r\nvisitors wore masks or women’s clothes, and played practical jokes with\r\nwater. Rams’ horns were sold at the fair, which lasted three days, and\r\nthe gilt on the gingerbread took the same shape. It will be remembered\r\nthat the symbol of St. Luke in Christian art is a horned ox.\r\n\r\n[864] Cf. p. 114. According to Spence, 196, the Shetland Christmas\r\nbegins on St. Thomas’s Day and ends on Jan. 18, known as ‘Four and\r\nTwenty Day.’ Candlemas (Feb. 2) is also often regarded as the end of\r\nthe Christmas season. The Anglo-Saxon Christmas feast lasted to the\r\nOctave of Epiphany (Tille, _Y. and C._ 165).\r\n\r\n[865] Dyer, 451; Ashton, 118, where the custom is said to have\r\nbeen ‘started by the Rev. J. Kenworthy, Rector of Ackworth, in\r\nYorkshire, ... for the special benefit of the birds.’\r\n\r\n[866] Frazer, i. 177, ii. 172, 286; Grimm, iv. 1783; Tille, _D.

The Conduits and Standards in the streetes\r\nwere, likewise, garnished.’ He gives an example from 1444.\r\n\r\n[869] Burne-Jackson, 245, 397, 411; Ashton, 95. Customs vary: here\r\nthe evergreens must be burnt; there given to the cattle. They should\r\nnot touch the ground (Grimm, iii. 1207). With this taboo compare that\r\ndescribed by ancient writers, probably on the authority of Posidonius,\r\nas existing in a cult of a god identified with Dionysus amongst the\r\nNamnites on the west coast of Gaul. A temple on an island was unroofed\r\nand reroofed by the priestesses annually. Did one of them drop her\r\nmaterials on the ground, she was torn to pieces by her companions\r\n(Rhys, _C. H._ 196). They are replaced on Candlemas by snowdrops, or,\r\naccording to Herrick, ‘the greener box.’ In Shropshire a garland made\r\nof blackthorn is left hanging from New Year to New Year, and then burnt\r\nin a festival fire (_F. L._ x. 489; xii. 349).\r\n\r\n[870] The Christmas, rivalry between holly and ivy is the subject\r\nof carols, some dating from the fifteenth century; cf.

Mistletoe is the chief ingredient of the ‘kissing-bunch,’\r\nsometimes a very elaborate affair, with apples and dolls hung in it.\r\nThe ecclesiastical taboo is not universal; in York Minster, e.g.,\r\nmistletoe was laid on the altar.\r\n\r\n[874] Tille, _Y. and C._ 174; _D.

My mother has\r\nhad branches of them for a flower-pott, several Christmasses, which I\r\nhave seen. Elias Ashmole, Esq., in his notes upon _Theatrum Chymicum_,\r\nsaies that in the churchyard at Glastonbury grew a walnutt tree, that\r\ndid putt out young leaves at Christmas, as doth the King’s Oake in the\r\nNew Forest. In Parham Park, in Suffolk (Mr. Boutele’s), is a pretty\r\nancient thorne, that blossomes like that at Glastonbury; the people\r\nflock hither to see it on Christmas day. But in the rode that leades\r\nfrom Worcester to Droitwiche is a black thorne hedge at Clayes, half\r\na mile long or more, that blossoms about Christmas-day for a week or\r\nmore together. Dr. Ezerel Tong sayd that about Rumly-Marsh in Kent,\r\nare thornes naturally like that near Glastonbury. The Soldiers did\r\ncutt downe that near Glastonbury: the stump remaines.’ Specimens are\r\nstill found about Glastonbury of _Crataegus oxyacantha praecox_, a\r\nwinter-flowering variety of hawthorn: some of the alleged slips from\r\nthe Glastonbury thorn appear, however, to be _Prunus communis_, or\r\nblackthorn. A writer in the _Gentleman’s Magazine_ for 1753 reports\r\nthat the opponents of the ‘New Style’ introduced in 1752 were\r\nencouraged by the refusal of the thorns at Glastonbury and Quainton in\r\nBuckinghamshire to flower before Old Christmas day. A Somerset woman\r\ntold a writer in 3 _N. Q._ ix. 33 that the buds of the thorns burst\r\ninto flower at midnight on Christmas Eve, ‘As they comed out, you could\r\nhear ‘um haffer.’\r\n\r\n[877] Tille, _Y. and C._ 175.\r\n\r\n[878] Usener, ii. 61.

The dolls sometimes\r\nrepresent the Virgin and Child. ‘Wesley-bob’ and the alternative\r\n‘vessel-cup’ appear to be corruptions of ‘wassail.’\r\n\r\n[880] Cf., however, the Burghead ceremony (p. 256).\r\n\r\n[881] Brand, i. 217; Burne-Jackson, 381; Dyer, 405; Ditchfield, 25,\r\n161; Northall, 216; Henderson, 66; Haddon, 476; Pfannenschmidt, 206.\r\nThe _N.

B. Thiers, _Traité des jeux et des\r\ndivertissemens_, 452; Müller, 103. There are some Guillaneu songs in\r\nBujeaud, ii. 153. The _quête_ was prohibited by two synods of Angers in\r\n1595 and 1668.\r\n\r\n[885] Brand, i. 247; Dyer, 505; Ditchfield, 44; Ashton, 217; Northall,\r\n181; Henderson, 76; Tille, _Y. and C._ 204; Nicholson, _Golspie_, 100;\r\nRhys, in _F. L._ ii. 308. Properly speaking, ‘Hogmanay’ is the gift\r\nof an oaten farl asked for in the _quête_. It is also applied to the\r\nday on which the _quête_ takes place, which is in Scotland generally\r\nNew Year’s Eve. Besides the _quête_, Hogmanay night, like Halloween\r\nelsewhere, is the night for horse-play and practical joking. The name\r\nappears in many forms, ‘Hogmana,’ ‘Hogomanay,’ ‘Nog-money’ (Scotland),\r\n‘Hogmina’ (Cumberland), ‘Hagmena’ (Northumberland), ‘Hagman heigh!’\r\n‘Hagman ha!’ (Yorkshire), ‘Agganow’ (Lancashire), ‘Hob dy naa,’ ‘Hob\r\nju naa’ (Isle of Man). It is generally accepted as equivalent to the\r\nFrench _aguilanneuf_, _aguilanleu_, _guillaneu_, _hagui men lo_,\r\n_hoquinano_, &c., ad infin., the earliest form being _auguilanleu_\r\n(1353). With the Scotch\r\n\r\n              ‘Hogmanay,\r\n              Trollolay,\r\n    Give us of your white bread and none of your grey’!\r\n\r\nmay be compared the French,\r\n\r\n              ‘Tire lire,\r\n    Maint de blanc, et point du bis.’\r\n\r\nOn no word has amateur philology been more riotous. It has been\r\nderived from ‘au gui menez,’ ‘à gui l’an neuf,’ ‘au gueux menez,’\r\n‘Hálig monath,’ ἁγία μήνη, ‘Homme est né,’ and the like. Tille thinks\r\nthat the whole of December was formerly Hogmanay, and derives from\r\n_monâth_ and either *_hoggva_, ‘hew,’ _hag_, ‘witch,’ or _hog_, ‘pig.’\r\nNicholson tries the other end, and traces _auguilanleu_ to the Spanish\r\n_aguinaldo_ or _aguilando_, ‘a New Year’s gift.’ This in turn he\r\nmakes the gerund of *_aguilar_, an assumed corruption of _alquilar_,\r\n‘to hire oneself out.’ Hogmanay will thus mean properly ‘handsel’ or\r\nhiring-money,’ and the first Monday in the New Year is actually called\r\nin Scotland ‘Handsel Monday.’ This is plausible, but, although no\r\nphilologist, I think a case might be made out for regarding the terms\r\nas corruptions of the Celtic _Nos Galan-gaeaf_, ‘the night of the\r\nwinter Calends’ (Rhys, 514). This is All Saints’ eve, while the Manx\r\n‘Hob dy naa’ _quête_ is on Hollantide (November 12; cf. p. 230).\r\n\r\n[886] A Gloucestershire wassail song in Dixon, _Ancient Poems_, 199,\r\nends,\r\n\r\n    ‘Come, butler, come bring us a bowl of the best:\r\n    I hope your soul in heaven will rest;\r\n    But if you do bring us a bowl of the small,\r\n    Then down fall butler, bowl and all.’\r\n\r\n[887] In Herefordshire and the south of Scotland it is lucky to draw\r\n‘the cream of the well’ or ‘the flower of the well,’ i. e. the first\r\npail of water after midnight on New Year’s eve (Dyer, 7, 17). In\r\nGermany _Heilwag_ similarly drawn at Christmas is medicinal (Grimm, iv.\r\n1810). Pembroke folk sprinkle each other on New Year’s Day (_F. L._\r\niii. 263). St. Martin of Braga condemns amongst Kalends customs ‘panem\r\nin fontem mittere (Appendix N, No. xxiii), and this form of well-cult\r\nsurvives at Christmas in the Tyrol (Jahn, 283) and in France (Müller,\r\n500). Tertullian chaffs the custom of early bathing at the _Saturnalia_\r\n(Appendix N, No. ii). Gervase of Tilbury (ed. Liebrecht, ii. 12)\r\nmentions an English belief (†1200) in a wonder-working Christmas dew.\r\nThis Tille (_Y. and C._ 168) thinks an outgrowth from the Advent chant\r\n_Rorate coeli_, but it seems closely parallel to the folk belief in\r\nMay-dew.\r\n\r\n[888] Burne-Jackson, 388; Simpson, 202; _F.

The familiar mode\r\nof choosing the king is thus described at Mont St. Michel ‘In vigilia\r\nEpyphaniae ad prandium habeant fratres gastellos et ponatur faba in\r\nuno; et frater qui inveniet fabam, vocabitur rex et sedebit ad magnam\r\nmensam, et scilicet sedebit ad vesperas ad matutinam et ad magnam\r\nmissam in cathedra parata’ (Gasté, 53).

In Davies, 270, is a letter from\r\nArchbp. Grindal and other ecclesiastical commissioners to the Lord\r\nMayor, dated November 13, 1572, blaming ‘a very rude and barbarouse\r\ncustome maynteyned in this citie and in no other citie or towne of\r\nthis realme to our knowledge, that yerely upon St. Thomas day before\r\nChristmas twoo disguysed persons, called Yule and Yule’s wife, shoulde\r\nryde throughe the citie very undecently and uncomely....’ Hereupon the\r\ncouncil suppressed the riding. Drake, _Eboracum_ (1736), 217, says that\r\noriginally a friar rode backwards and ‘painted like a Jew.’ He gives an\r\nhistorical legend to account for the origin of the custom. Religious\r\ninterludes were played on the same day: cf. _Representations_.

The riot was against the Abbot of St. Benet’s Holm, and the\r\nmonks declared that one John Gladman was set up as a king, an act of\r\ntreason against Henry VI. The city was fined 1,000 marks. In 1448 they\r\nset forth their wrongs in a ‘Bill’ and explained that Gladman ‘who\r\nwas ever, and at thys our is, a man of sad disposition, and trewe and\r\nfeythfull to God and to the Kyng, of disporte as hath ben acustomed\r\nin ony cite or burgh thorowe alle this realme, on Tuesday in the last\r\nende of Cristemesse, viz.

A custom of\r\nfeasting on the tombs of the dead on the day of St. Peter de Cathedra\r\n(Feb. 22) is condemned by the _Council of Tours_ (567), c. 23 (Maassen,\r\ni. 133) ‘sunt etiam qui in festivitate cathedrae domui Petri apostoli\r\ncibos mortuis offerunt, et post missas redeuntes ad domos proprias, ad\r\ngentilium revertuntur errores, et post corpus Domini, sacratas daemoni\r\nescas accipiunt.’ I do not doubt that the Germano-Keltic tribes had\r\ntheir spring _Todtenfest_, but the date Feb. 22 seems determined by the\r\nRoman _Parentalia_ extending from Feb. 13 to either Feb. 21 (_Feralia_)\r\nor Feb. 22 (_Cara Cognatio_): cf. Fowler, 306. The ‘cibi’ mentioned\r\nby the council of Tours seem to have been offered in the house, like\r\nthe winter offerings described below; but there is also evidence for\r\nsimilar Germano-Keltic offerings on the tomb or howe itself; and these\r\nwere often accompanied by _dadsisas_ or dirges; cf. Saupe, _Indiculus_,\r\n5-9. Saupe considers the _spurcalia in Februario_, explained above (p.\r\n114) as a ploughing rite, to be funereal.\r\n\r\n[933] Pfannenschmidt, 123, 165, 435; Saupe, 9; Golther, 586; _C. P.

Octobris, qui dies erroris,\r\nreligiosorum sanctione virorum mutati sunt in ieiunia et orationes,\r\noblationes quoque omnium nos praecedentium christianorum.’ This is\r\nprobably a myth to account for the harvest _Todtenfest_, which may more\r\nnaturally be thought of as transferred with the agricultural rites from\r\nNovember. For the mediaeval _Gemeinwoche_, beginning on the Sunday\r\nafter Michaelmas, was common to Germany, and not confined to Saxony.\r\nMichaelmas, the feast of angels, known at Rome in the sixth century,\r\nand in Germany by the ninth, also adapts itself to the notion of a\r\n_Todtenfest_.\r\n\r\n[934] Pfannenschmidt, 168, 443.\r\n\r\n[935] Mogk, in Paul, iii. 260; Tille, _Y. and C._ 107.\r\n\r\n[936] Cf. p. 231.\r\n\r\n[937] Appendix N, Nos. xii, xvii, xxvii, xxxiii, xxxv, xxxix.\r\n\r\n[938] Appendix N, No. xlii.\r\n\r\n[939] Martin of Amberg, _Gewissensspiegel_ (thirteenth century, quoted\r\nJahn, 282), the food and drink are left for ‘Percht mit der eisnen\r\nnasen.’\r\n\r\n[940] _Thes.

I do not know where Shakespeare got the\r\nidea, of which I find no confirmation; but its origin is probably an\r\necclesiastical attempt to parry folk-belief. Other Kalends notions have\r\ntaken on a Christian colouring. The miraculous events of Christmas\r\nnight are rooted in the conception that the Kalends must abound in all\r\ngood things, in order that the coming year may do so. But allusions to\r\nChristian legend have been worked into and have transformed them. On\r\nChristmas night bees sing (Brand, i. 3), and water is turned into wine\r\n(Grimm, iv. 1779, 1809). While the genealogy is sung at the midnight\r\nmass, hidden treasures are revealed (Grimm, iv. 1840). Similarly, the\r\ncattle of heathen masters naturally shared in the Kalends good cheer;\r\nwhence a Christian notion that they, and in particular the ox and the\r\nass, witnesses of the Nativity, can speak on that night, and bear\r\ntestimony to the good or ill-treatment of the farmers (Grimm, iv. 1809,\r\n1840); cf. the _Speculum Perfectionis_, c. 114, ed. Sabatier, 225 ‘quod\r\nvolebat [S. Franciscus] suadere imperatori ut faceret specialem legem\r\nquod in Nativitate Domini homines bene providerent avibus et bovi et\r\nasino et pauperibus’: also p. 250, n. 1.--Ten minutes after writing\r\nthe above note, I have come on the following passage in Tolstoi,\r\n_Résurrection_ (trad. franç.), i. 297 ‘Un proverbe dit que les coqs\r\nchantent de bonne heure dans les nuits joyeuses.’\r\n\r\n[956] Müller, 272.\r\n\r\n[957] Pfannenschmidt, 207.\r\n\r\n[958] Müller, 235, 239, 248.\r\n\r\n[959] Tille, _D.

The _sacci_ are\r\ninteresting, for English nurses frighten children with a threat that\r\nthe chimney-sweep (here as in the May-game inheriting the tradition on\r\naccount of his black face) will put them in his sack. The _beneficent_\r\nChristmas wanderers use the sack to bring presents in; cf. the\r\ndevelopment of the sack in the Mummers’ play (p. 215).\r\n\r\n[960] Müller, 235, 248.\r\n\r\n[961] A mince-pie eaten in a different house on each night of the\r\nTwelves (_not_ twelve mince-pies eaten _before_ Christmas) ensures\r\ntwelve lucky months. The weather of each day in the Twelves determines\r\nthat of a month (Harland, 99; Jackson and Burne, 408). I have heard of\r\na custom of leaping over twelve lighted candles on New Year’s eve.

Fiunt autem quatuor tripudia post Nativitatem\r\nDomini in Ecclesia, levitarum scilicet, sacerdotum, puerorum, id est\r\nminorum aetate et ordine, et hypodiaconorum, qui ordo incertus est.\r\nUnde fit ut ille quandoque annumeretur inter sacros ordines, quandoque\r\nnon, quod expresse ex eo intelligitur quod certum tempus non habeat, et\r\nofficio celebretur confuso.’ Cf. ch. xv on the three other _tripudia_.\r\n\r\n[982] Lebeuf, _Hist. de Paris_ (1741), ii. 277; Grenier, 365:\r\n\r\n      _Ad amicum venturum ad festum Baculi._\r\n    Festa dies aliis Baculus venit et novus annus,\r\n      Qua venies, veniet haec mihi festa dies.\r\n\r\nLeonius is named as canon of N.-D. in the _Obituary_ of the church\r\nGuérard, _Cartulaire de N.-D._ in (_Doc. inédits sur l’Hist. de\r\nFrance_, iv. 34), but unfortunately the year of his death is not given.\r\n\r\n[983] During the fifteenth century the _Chantre_ of N.-D. ‘porta le\r\nbaston’ at the chief feasts as ruler of the choir (F. L. Chartier,\r\n_L’ancien Chapitre de N.-D. de Paris_ (1897), 176). This _baculus_ must\r\nbe distinguished from the _baculus pastoralis_ or _episcopi_.\r\n\r\n[984] Guérard, _Cartulaire de N.-D._ (_Doc. inéd. sur l’Hist. de\r\nFrance_), i. 73; also printed by Ducange, s. v. _Kalendae_; _P. L._\r\nccxii. 70. The _charta_, dated 1198, runs in the names of ‘Odo [de\r\nSoliaco] episcopus, H. decanus, R. cantor, Mauricius, Heimericus et\r\nOdo archidiaconi, Galo, succentor, magister Petrus cancellarius, et\r\nmagister Petrus de Corbolio, canonicus Parisiensis.’ Possibly the real\r\nmoving spirit in the reform was the dean H[ugo Clemens], to whom the\r\nParis _Obituary_ (Guérard, _loc. cit._ iv. 61) assigns a similar reform\r\nof the feast of St. John the Evangelist. Petrus de Corbolio we shall\r\nmeet again. Eudes de Sully was bishop 1196-1208. His _Constitutions_\r\n(_P. L._ ccxii. 66) contain a prohibition of ‘choreae ... in ecclesiis,\r\nin coemeteriis et in processionibus.’ In a second decree of 1199 (_P.\r\nL._ ccxii. 72) he provided a _solatium_ for the loss of the Feast of\r\nFools in a payment of three _deniers_ to each clerk below the degree\r\nof canon, and two _deniers_ to each boy present at Matins on the\r\nCircumcision. Should the abuses recur, the payment was to lapse. This\r\ndonation was confirmed in 1208 by his successor Petrus de Nemore (_P.\r\nL._ ccxii. 92).\r\n\r\n[985] A ‘hearse’ was a framework of wood or iron bearing spikes for\r\ntapers (Wordsworth, _Mediaeval Services_, 156). The _penna_ was also a\r\nstand for candles (Ducange, s.v.).\r\n\r\n[986] A _prosa_ is a term given in French liturgies to an additional\r\nchant inserted on festal occasions as a gloss upon or interpolation in\r\nthe text of the office or mass. It covers nearly, though not quite,\r\nthe same ground as _Sequentia_, and comes under the general head of\r\n_Tropus_ (ch. xviii). For a more exact differentiation cf. Frere,\r\n_Winchester Troper_, ix. _Laetemur gaudiis_ is a prose ascribed to\r\nNotker Balbulus of St. Gall.\r\n\r\n[987] _cum farsia_: a _farsia_, _farsa_, or _farsura_ (Lat.\r\n_farcire_, ‘to stuff’), is a _Tropus_ interpolated into the text of\r\ncertain portions of the office or mass, especially the _Kyrie_, the\r\n_Lectiones_ and the _Epistola_. Such farces were generally in Latin,\r\nbut occasionally, especially in the Epistle, in the vernacular (Frere,\r\n_Winchester Troper_, ix, xvi).\r\n\r\n[988] _Laetabundus_: i. e. St. Bernard’s prose beginning _Laetabundus\r\nexultet fidelis chorus; Alleluia_ (Daniel, _Thesaurus Hymnologicus_,\r\nii. 61), which was widely used in the feasts of the Christmas season.\r\n\r\n[989] The document is too long to quote in full. These are the\r\nessential passages. The legate says: The Church of Paris is famous,\r\ntherefore diligence must be used ‘ad exstirpandum penitus quod ibidem\r\nsub praetextu pravae consuetudinis inolevit ... Didicimus quod in\r\nfesto Circumcisionis Dominicae ... tot consueverunt enormitates et\r\nopera flagitiosa committi, quod locum sanctum ... non solum foeditate\r\nverborum, verum etiam sanguinis effusione plerumque contingit\r\ninquinari, et ... ut sacratissima dies ... festum fatuorum nec\r\nimmerito generaliter consueverit appellari.’ Odo and the rest order:\r\n‘In vigilia festivitatis ad Vesperas campanae ordinate sicut in duplo\r\nsimplici pulsabuntur. Cantor faciet matriculam (the roll of clergy for\r\nthe day’s services) in omnibus ordinate; rimos, personas, luminaria\r\nherciarum nisi tantum in rotis ferreis, et in penna, si tamen voluerit\r\nille qui capam redditurus est, fieri prohibemus; statuimus etiam ne\r\ndominus festi cum processione vel cantu ad ecclesiam adducatur, vel ad\r\ndomum suam ab ecclesia reducatur. In choro autem induet capam suam,\r\nassistentibus ei duobus canonicis subdiaconis, et tenens baculum\r\ncantoris, antequam incipiantur Vesperae, incipiet prosam _Laetemur\r\ngaudiis_: qua finita episcopus, si praesens fuerit ... incipiet\r\nVesperas ordinate et solemniter celebrandas; ... a quatuor subdiaconis\r\nindutis capis sericis Responsorium cantabitur.... Missa similiter cum\r\nhoris ordinate celebrabitur ab aliquo praedictorum, hoc addito quod\r\nEpistola cum farsia dicetur a duobus in capis sericis, et postmodum a\r\nsubdiacono ... Vesperae sequentes sicut priores a _Laetemur gaudiis_\r\nhabebunt initium: et cantabitur _Laetabundus_, loco hymni. _Deposuit_\r\nquinquies ad plus dicetur loco suo; et si captus fuerit baculus,\r\nfinito _Te Deum laudamus_, consummabuntur Vesperae ab eo quo fuerint\r\ninchoatae.... Per totum festum in omnibus horis canonici et clerici in\r\nstallis suis ordinate et regulariter se habebunt.’\r\n\r\n[990] The feast lasted from Vespers on the vigil to Vespers on the day\r\nof the Circumcision. The _Hauptmoment_ was evidently the _Magnificat_\r\nin the second Vespers. But what exactly took place then? Did the\r\ncathedral precentor hand over the _baculus_ to the _dominus festi_,\r\nor was it last year’s _dominus festi_, who now handed it over to his\r\nnewly-chosen successor? Probably the latter. The _dominus festi_ is\r\ncalled at first Vespers ‘capam redditurus’: doubtless the cope and\r\n_baculus_ went together. The _dominus festi_ may have, as elsewhere,\r\nexercised disciplinary and representative functions amongst the\r\ninferior clergy during the year. His title I take to have been, as\r\nat Sens, _precentor stultorum_. The order says, ‘si captus fuerit\r\nbaculus’; probably it was left to the chapter to decide whether the\r\nformal installation of the _precentor_ in church should take place in\r\nany particular year.\r\n\r\n[991] _P. L._ ccxv. 1070 ‘Interdum ludi fiunt in eisdem ecclesiis\r\ntheatrales, et non solum ad ludibriorum spectacula introducuntur in\r\neas monstra larvarum, verum etiam in tribus anni festivitatibus, quae\r\ncontinue Natalem Christi sequuntur, diaconi, presbiteri ac subdiaconi\r\nvicissim insaniae suae ludibria exercentes, per gesticulationum\r\nsuarum debacchationes obscoenas in conspectu populi decus faciunt\r\nclericale vilescere....

IX_, lib. iii. tit. i. cap. 12 (_C. I. Can._\r\ned. Friedberg, ii. 452).

Idem fortius\r\nmonachis et monialibus prohibemus.’ Can. 18 is a prohibition against\r\n‘choreae,’ similar to that of Eudes de Sully already referred to. Such\r\ngeneral prohibitions are as common during the mediaeval period as\r\nduring that of the conversion (cf. ch. viii), and probably covered the\r\nFeast of Fools. See e.g. _C. of Avignon_ (1209), c. 17 (Mansi, xxii.\r\n791), _C. of Rouen_ (1231), c. 14 (Mansi, xxiii. 216), _C. of Bayeux_\r\n(1300), c. 31 (Mansi, xxv. 66).\r\n\r\n[994] _Codex Senonen._ 46 A.

Molinier, _Hist. générale des Arts\r\nappliqués_, i; _Les Ivoires_ (1896), 47 (plate); A. M. Cust, _Ivory\r\nWorkers of the Middle Ages_ (1902), 34. This last writer says that\r\nthe diptych is now in the Bibl. Nationale. The leaves of the diptych\r\nrepresent a Triumph of Bacchus, and a Triumph of Artemis or Aphrodite.\r\nIt has nothing to do with the Feast of Fools, and is of sixth-century\r\nworkmanship.\r\n\r\n[996] Dreves, 575, thinks the MS. was ‘für eine Geckenbruderschaft,’ as\r\nthe chants are not in the contemporary Missals, Breviaries, Graduais,\r\nand Antiphonals of the church. But if they were, a separate _Officium_\r\nbook would be superfluous. Such special _festorum libri_ were in use\r\nelsewhere, e.g. at Amiens. Nisard, _op. cit._, thinks the _Officium_\r\nwas an imitation one written by ‘notaires’ to amuse the choir-boys,\r\nand cites a paper of M. Carlier, canon of Sens, before the Historic\r\nCongress held at Sens in 1850 in support of this view. Doubtless the\r\n_goliardi_ wrote such imitations (cf. the _missa lusorum_ in Schmeller,\r\n_Carmina Burana_, 248; the _missa de potatoribus_ in Wright-Halliwell,\r\n_Reliquiae Antiquae_, ii. 208; and the _missa potatorum_ in F.\r\nNovati, _La Parodia sacra nelle Letterature moderne_ (_Studi critici\r\ne letterari_, 289)); but this is too long to be one, and is not a\r\nburlesque at all.\r\n\r\n[997] Cf. the chapter decree of 1524 ‘festum Circumcisionis a\r\ndefuncto Corbolio institutum,’ which is doubtless the authority for\r\nthe statements of Taveau, _Hist. archiep. Senonen_. (1608), 94;\r\nSaint-Marthe, _Gallia Christiana_ (1770), xii. 60; Baluze, note in _B.\r\nN. Cod. Parisin_. 1351 C. (quoted Nisard, _op. cit._).\r\n\r\n[998] Dreves, 575; Chérest, 15, who quotes an elaborate opinion of M.\r\nQuantin, ‘archiviste de l’Yonne.’ M. Quantin believes that the hand\r\nis that of a charter of Pierre de Corbeil, dated 1201, in the Yonne\r\narchives. On the other hand Nisard, _op. cit._, and Danjou, _Revue\r\nde musique religieuse_ (1847), 287, think that the MS. is of the\r\nfourteenth century.\r\n\r\n[999] Chérest, 35; Dreves, 576.\r\n\r\n[1000] Liturgically a _conductus_ is a form of _Cantio_, that is, an\r\ninterpolation in the mass or office, which stands as an independent\r\nunit, and not, like the Tropes, Proses and Sequences, as an extension\r\nof the proper liturgical texts. The _Cantiones_ are, however, only a\r\nfurther step in the process which began with Tropes (Nisard, _op. cit._\r\n191; Dreves, _Anal. Hymn._ xx. 6). From the point of view of musical\r\nscience H. E. Wooldridge, _Oxford Hist. of Music_, i. 308, defines a\r\n_conductus_ as ‘a composition of equally free and flowing melodies in\r\nall the parts, in which the words are metrical and given to the lower\r\nvoice only.’ The term is several times used in the _Officium_. Clément,\r\n163, falls foul of Dulaure for taking it as an adjective throughout,\r\nwith _asinus_ understood.\r\n\r\n[1001] Wordsworth, _Mediaeval Services_, 289; Clément, 126, 163.\r\nDulaure seems to have taken the _tabula_ for the altar. The English\r\nname for the _tabula_ was _wax-brede_. An example (†1500) is printed by\r\nH. E. Reynolds, _Use of Exeter Cathedral_, 73.\r\n\r\n[1002] Appendix L; where the various versions of the ‘Prose’ are\r\ncollated.\r\n\r\n[1003] There are many hymns beginning _Salve, festa dies_. The model\r\nis a couplet of Venantius Fortunatus, _Carmina_, iii. 9, _Ad Felicem\r\nepiscopum de Pascha_, 39 (M. G. H. _Auct. Antiquiss_. iv. 1. 60):\r\n\r\n    ‘Salve, festa dies, toto venerabilis aevo,\r\n     qua Deus infernum vicit et astra tenet.’\r\n\r\n[1004] Clément, 127, correcting an error of Lebeuf. A still more\r\ncurious slip is that of M. Bourquelot, who found in the word _euouae_,\r\nwhich occurs frequently in the _Officium_, an echo of the Bacchic cry\r\n_évohé_. Now _euouae_ represents the vowels of the words _Seculorum\r\namen_, and is noted at the ends of antiphons in most choir-books to\r\ngive the tone for the following psalm (Clément, 164).\r\n\r\n[1005] Clément, 138, reads _Conductus ad Ludos_, and inserts before _In\r\nLaudibus_ the word _Ludarius_. Dreves, _Anal. Hymn._ xx. 221, reads\r\n_Conductus ad Laudes_. The section _In Laudibus_, not being metrical,\r\nis not printed by him, so I do not know what he makes of _Ludarius_. If\r\nClément is right, I suppose a secular revel divided Matins and Lauds,\r\nwhich seems unlikely.\r\n\r\n[1006] I follow Dreves, _Anal. Hymn._ xx. 228. Clément, 151, has again\r\n_Ludarium_.\r\n\r\n[1007] Prudentius, _Cathemerinon_, iii.\r\n\r\n[1008] _Egerton MS._ 2615 (_Catalogue of Additions to MSS. in B. M._\r\n1882-87, p. 336). On the last page is written ‘Iste liber est beati\r\npetri beluacensis.’ On ff. 78, 110^v are book-plates of the chapter of\r\nBeauvais, the former signed ‘Vollet f[ecit].’ The MS. was bought by the\r\nBritish Museum in 1883, and formerly belonged to Signor Pachiarotti\r\nof Padua. It was described and a facsimile of the harmonized Prose\r\nof the Ass given in _Annales archéologiques_ (1856), xvi. 259, 300.\r\nDreves, _Anal. Hymn._ xx. 230 (1895), speaks of it as ‘vielleicht noch\r\nin Italien in Privatbesitz.’ This, and not the MS. used by Ducange’s\r\neditors, is the MS. whose description Desjardins, 127, 168, gives from\r\na 1464 Beauvais inventory: ‘N^o. 76. Item ung petit volume entre deux\r\nais sans cuir l’ung d’icelx ais rompu à demy contenant plusieurs proses\r\nantiennes et commencemens des messes avec oraisons commençant au ii^e\r\nfeuillet _Belle bouche_ et au pénultième _coopertum stolla candida_.’\r\nThe broken board was mended, after 420 years, by the British Museum in\r\n1884.\r\n\r\n[1009] _B. M. Catalogue_, _loc. cit._, ‘Written in the xiii^{th} cent.,\r\nprobably during the pontificate of Gregory IX (1227-41) and before the\r\nmarriage of Louis IX to Marguerite of Provence in 1234.’ There are\r\nprayers for Gregorius Papa and Ludovicus Rex on ff. 42, 42^v, but none\r\nfor any queen of France.\r\n\r\n[1010] Between ff. 40^{vo} and 41.\r\n\r\n[1011] So _B. M. Catalogue_, _loc. cit._ To me it reads like ‘Conductus\r\nasi ... adducitur.’\r\n\r\n[1012] F. 43.\r\n\r\n[1013] Cf. ch. xix.\r\n\r\n[1014] Louis VII married Adèle de Champagne in 1160 and died in 1180.\r\n\r\n[1015] Pierre Louvet, _Hist. du Dioc. de Beauvais_ (1635), ii. 299,\r\nquoted by Desjardins, 124. I am sorry not to have been able to get hold\r\nof the original. Nor can I find E. Charvet, _Rech. sur les anciens\r\nthéâtres de Beauvais_ (1881).\r\n\r\n[1016] Grenier, 362. He says the ‘cérémonial’ is ‘tiré d’un ms. de\r\nla cathédrale de Beauvais,’ and gives the footnote ‘Preuv. part\r\n1, n^o.  .’ On the prose _Kalendas Ianuarias_ and the censing his\r\nfootnotes refer to Ducange, s. v. _Kalendae_. The ‘Preuves’ for his\r\nhistory are scattered through the _MSS. Picardie_ in the _Bibl. Nat._\r\nNo doubt the reference here is to MSS. 14 and 158 which are copies of\r\nthe Beauvais office (Dreves, in _Stimmen aus Maria-Laach_, xlvii. 575).\r\nThese, or parts of them, are printed by F. Bourquelot, in _Bulletin de\r\nla Soc. arch. de Sens_ (1854), vi. 171 (which also, unfortunately, I\r\nhave not seen), and chants from them are in Dreves, _Anal. Hymn._ xx.\r\n229. But here Dreves seems to speak of them as copies of Pacchiarotti’s\r\nMS. (_Egerton MS._ 2615). And Desjardins, 124, says that Grenier\r\nand Bourquelot used extracts from eighteenth-century copies of\r\nPacchiarotti’s MS. in the library of M. Borel de Brétizel. Are these\r\nwriters mistaken, or did Grenier only see the copies, and take his\r\ndescription from Louvet? And what has become of the twelfth-century MS.?\r\n\r\n[1017] Ducange, s. v. _Kalendae_, ‘MS. codice Bellovac. ann. circiter\r\n500, ubi 1^a haec occurrit rubrica _Dominus ... ianuae_. Et alibi\r\n_Hac ... saucita_.’\r\n\r\n[1018] Ducange, s. v. _Festum Asinorum_. Desjardins and other writers\r\ngive the date of the ‘codex’ as twelfth century. But 500 years from\r\n1733-6 only bring it to the thirteenth century. The mistake is due to\r\nthe fact that the _first_ edition of Ducange, in which the ‘codex’ is\r\nnot mentioned, is of 1678. Clément, 158, appears to have no knowledge\r\nof the MS. but what he read in Ducange; and it is not quite clear what\r\nhe means when he says that it ‘d’après nos renseignements, ne renferme\r\npas un office, mais une sorte de _mystère_ postérieur d’un siècle au\r\nmoins à l’office de Sens, et n’ayant aucune autorité historique et\r\nencore bien moins religieuse.’ The MS. was contemporary with the Sens\r\n_Officium_, and although certainly influenced by the religious drama\r\nwas still liturgic (cf. ch. xx).\r\n\r\n[1019] Cf. Appendix L, on an _Officium_ (1553) for Jan. 1 without\r\n_stulti_ or _asinus_, from Puy.\r\n\r\n[1020] Leber, ix. 238. This is a note by J. B. Salques to the reprint\r\nof D’Artigny’s memoir on the _Fête des Fous_. The writer calls the\r\nceremony the ‘fête des apôtres,’ and says that it was held at the same\r\ntime as the ‘fête de l’âne.’ He describes a Rabelaisian _contretemps_,\r\nwhich is said to have put an end to the procession in 1634. No\r\nauthority is given for this account, which I believe to be the source\r\nof all later notices. I may add that Ducange gives the name _Festum\r\nApostolorum_ to the feast of St. Philip and St. James on May 1.\r\n\r\n[1021] _Cod. Senonens_.

The directions for Jan. 1 are fragmentary: ‘In\r\nquo vicarii ceterique clerici chorum frequentantes et eorum episcopus\r\nse habeant in cantando et officiando sicut superius dictum est in\r\nfesto Sanctorum Innocentium (cf. p. 370), hoc tamen excepto quod omnia\r\nquae ista die fiunt officiando quando est festum fatuorum pro posse\r\nfiunt et etiam ullulando ... domino decano fatuorum ferunt incensum\r\nsed prepostere ut dictum est.’ _Ululatus_ is, however, sometimes a\r\ntechnical term in church music; cf. vol. ii. p. 7.\r\n\r\n[1023] _R. de Renard_, xii. 469 (ed. Martin, vol. ii. 14):\r\n\r\n    ‘Dan prestre, il est la feste as fox.\r\n     Si fera len demein des chox\r\n     Et grant departie a Baieus:\r\n     Ales i, si verres les jeus.’\r\n\r\nBranch xii of the _Roman_ is the composition of Richart de Lison,\r\nwho, according to Martin, suppl. 72, wrote in Normandy †1200. The\r\nphrase ‘faire les choux’ = ‘get drunk,’ cabbages being regarded as\r\nprophylactic of the ill effects of liquor.\r\n\r\n[1024] _Hist. de l’Église d’Autun_ (1774), 469, 631 ‘Item innovamus,\r\nquod ille qui de caetero capiet baculum anni novi nihil penitus habebit\r\nde bursa Capituli’ (_Registr. Capit._ s. a. 1230).\r\n\r\n[1025] Martene and Durand, _Thesaurus Anecdotorum_, iv. 1070 ‘in\r\nfesto stultorum, scilicet Innocentium et anni novi ... multa fiunt\r\ninhonesta ... ne talia festa irrisoria de cetero facere praesumant.’\r\n\r\n[1026] Ducange, s. v. _abbas esclaffardorum_, quoting _Hist. Delphin._\r\ni. 132; J. J. A. Pilot de Thorey, _Usages, Fêtes et Coutumes en\r\nDauphiné_, i. 182. The latter writer says that there was also an\r\n_episcopus_, who was not suppressed, that the canons did reverence to\r\nhim, and that the singing of the _Magnificat_ was part of the feast.\r\n\r\n[1027] C. Hidé, _Bull. de la Soc. acad. de Laon_ (1863), xiii. 115.\r\n\r\n[1028] Grenier, 361 ‘Si hoc dicitur festum stultorum a subdiaconis\r\nfiat, et dominica eveniat, ab ipsis fiat festum in cappis sericis,\r\nsicut in libris festorum continetur.’ These _libri_ possibly resembled\r\nthose of Sens and Beauvais.\r\n\r\n[1029] _Summa Gulielmi Autissiodorensis de Off. Eccles._ (quoted by\r\nChérest, 44, from _Bibl. Nat. MS._ 1411) ‘Quaeritur quare in hac die\r\nfit festum stultorum.... Ante adventum Domini celebrabant festa quae\r\nvocabant Parentalia; et in illa die spem ponebant credentes quod si in\r\nilla die bene eis accideret, quod similiter in toto anno. Hoc festum\r\nvoluit removere Ecclesia quod contra fidem est. Et quia extirpare\r\nomnino non potuit, festum illud permittit et celebrat illud festum\r\nceleberrimum ut aliud demittatur: et ideo in matutinali officio\r\nleguntur lectiones quae dehortantur ab huiusmodi quae sunt contra\r\nfidem (cf. p. 245). Et si ista die ab ecclesia quaedam fiunt praeter\r\nfidem, nulla tamen contra fidem. Et ideo ludos qui sunt contra fidem\r\npermutavit in ludos qui non sunt contra fidem.’ There is clearly\r\na confusion here between the Roman _Parentalia_ (Feb. 13-22) and\r\n_Kalendae_ (Jan. 1). On William of Auxerre, whose work remains in MS.,\r\ncf. Lebeuf, in P. Desmolets, _Mémoires_, iii. 339; _Nouvelle Biographie\r\nuniverselle_, s. n. He was bishop of Auxerre, translated to Paris\r\nin 1220, ob. 1223. He must be distinguished from another William of\r\nAuxerre, who was archdeacon of Beauvais (†1230), and wrote a comment on\r\nPetrus Lombardus, printed at Paris in 1500 (Gröber, _Grundriss der röm.\r\nPhilologie_, ii. 1. 239).\r\n\r\n[1030] Gulielmus Durandus, _Rationale Div. Off._ (Antwerp, 1614), vi.\r\n15, _de Circumcisione_, ‘In quibusdam ecclesiis subdiaconi fortes\r\net iuvenes faciunt hodie festum ad significandum quod in octava\r\nresurgentium, quae significatur per octavam diem, qua circumcisio\r\nfiebat, nulla erit debilis aetas, non senectus, non senium, non\r\nimpotens pueritia ... &c.’ A reference to the heathen Kalends\r\nfollows; cf. also vii. 42, _de festis SS. Stephani, Ioannis Evang.\r\net Innocentium_, ‘... subdiaconi vero faciunt festum in quibusdam\r\necclesiis in festo circumcisionis, ut ibi dictum est: in aliis in\r\nEpiphania et etiam in aliis in octava Epiphaniae, quod vocant festum\r\nstultorum. Quia enim ordo ille antiquitus incertus erat, nam in\r\ncanonibus antiquis (extra de aetate et qualitate) multis quandoque\r\nvocatur sacer et quandoque non, ideo subdiaconi certum ad festandum non\r\nhabent diem, et eorum festum officio celebratur confuso.’ On Durandus\r\ncf. the translation of his work by C. Barthélemy (1854). He was born at\r\nPuymisson in the diocese of Béziers (1230), finished the _Rationale_\r\n(1284), became bishop of Mende (1285), and ob. (1296).\r\n\r\n[1031] A.

A chapter decree of 1437 lays down that a vicar who has served\r\nas ‘archbishop’ and has subsequently left the cathedral and returned\r\nagain, need not serve a second time.

Extracts are given\r\nby Ducange, s. v. _Kalendae_. The king speaks of the Troyes affair\r\nas leading to the Theological Faculty’s letter. It is permissible to\r\nconjecture that he was moved, no doubt by the abstract rights and\r\nwrongs of the case, but also by a rumour spread at Troyes that he had\r\nrevoked the Pragmatic Sanction. For, as a matter of fact, Peter of\r\nBrescia, the papal legate, was trying hard to get him to revoke it.\r\n\r\n[1046] Boutiot, _op. cit._ i. 494, iii. 20. The chapters of St.\r\nStephen’s and St. Urban’s and the abbey of St. Loup all continued to\r\nmake payments for their feasts after 1445. They may have been pruned of\r\nabuses. In the sixteenth century the Comte of Champagne pays five sous\r\nto the ‘archevesque des Saulx’ at St. Stephen’s, and this appears to be\r\nthe _droit_ charged upon the royal demesne up to 1789.\r\n\r\n[1047] Chérest, 66, from _Acta Capitularia_ (Dec. 4, 1444) in _Bibl.\r\nNat. Cod. Paris._ 1014 and 1351 ‘De servitio dominicae circumcisionis,\r\nviso super hoc statuto per quemdam legatum edito, et consideratis\r\naliis circa hoc considerandis, et ad evitandum scandala, quae super\r\nhoc possent exoriri, ordinatum fuit unanimiter et concorditer, nemine\r\ndiscrepante, quod de caetero dictum servitium fiet, prout iacet\r\nin libro ipsius servitii, devote et cum reverentia; absque aliqua\r\nderisione, tumultu aut turpitudine, prout fiunt alia servitia in\r\naliis festis, in habitibus per dictum statutum ordinatis, et non\r\nalias, et voce modulosa, absque dissonantia, et assistant in huiusmodi\r\nservitio omnes qui tenentur in eo interesse, et faciant debitum suum\r\nabsque discursu aut turbatione servitii, potissime in ecclesia; nec\r\nproiiciatur aqua in vesperis super praecentorem stultorum ultra\r\nquantitatem trium sitularum ad plus; nec adducantur nudi in crastino\r\nfesti dominicae nativitatis, sine brachis verenda tegentibus, nec etiam\r\nadducantur in ecclesia, sed ducantur ad puteum claustri, non hora\r\nservitii sed alia, et ibi rigentur sola situla aquae sine lesione.\r\nQui contrarium fecerit occurrit ipso facto suspensionis censuram per\r\ndictum statutum latam; attamen extra ecclesiam permissum est quod\r\nstulti faciant alias ceremonias sine damno aut iniuria cuiusquam.’ The\r\nproceedings on the day after the Nativity are probably explained by\r\nthe election of the precentor on that day (after Vespers). The victims\r\nducked may have failed to be present at the election; but cf. the\r\nEaster _prisio_ (ch. vii).\r\n\r\n[1048] Saint-Marthe, _Gallia Christiana_, xii. 96, partly quoted by\r\nDucange, s. v. _Kalendae_. The bishop describes the feast almost in the\r\n_ipsissima verba_ of the Paris Theologians, but in one passage (‘nudos\r\nhomines sine verendorum tegmine inverecunde ducendo per villam et\r\ntheatra in curribus et vehiculis sordidis, &c.’) he adds a trait from\r\nthe Sens chapter act just quoted.\r\n\r\n[1049] Chérest, 68. The councils of Sens in 1460 and 1485 (p. 300) are\r\nfor the province. That of 1528 (sometimes called of Sens, but properly\r\nof Paris) is national. They are not evidence for the feast at Sens\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n[1050] Ibid. 72 ‘Insolentias, tam de die quam de nocte, faciendo\r\ntondere barbam parte, ut fieri consuevit, in theatro ... ac ludere\r\npersonagia, die scilicet circumcisionis Domini.’ The shaven face was\r\ncharacteristic of the mediaeval fool, minstrel, or actor (cf. ch. ii).\r\nDreves, 586, adds that Tallinus Bissart, the precentor of this year,\r\nwas threatened with excommunication.\r\n\r\n[1051] Ibid. 75.\r\n\r\n[1052] Ibid. 76 ‘prohibitum vicariis ne attentent, ultima die anni,\r\nin theatro tabulato ante valvas ecclesiae aut alibi in civitate\r\nSenonensi, publice barbam illius qui se praecentorem fatuorum nominat,\r\naut alterius, radere, radifacere, permittere, aut procurare; et ne ad\r\nelectionem dicti praecentoris die festo Sancti Iohannis Evangelistae\r\nsub poenis excommunicationis.’\r\n\r\n[1053] Ibid. 77 ‘honeste, ac devote, sine laternis, sine precentore,\r\nsine delatione baculi domini precentoris, nec poterunt facere rasuram\r\nin theatro ante ecclesiam.’\r\n\r\n[1054] Ibid. 78.\r\n\r\n[1055] Dreves, 586.\r\n\r\n[1056] _Prov. C. of Rouen_ (1445), c. 11 (Labbé, xiii. 1304) ‘prohibet\r\nhaec sancta synodus ludos qui fatuorum vulgariter nuncupantur\r\ncum larvatis faciebus et alias inhoneste fieri in ecclesiis aut\r\ncemeteriis’; _Prov. C. of Sens_ (1485, repeats decrees of earlier\r\ncouncil of 1460), c. 3 (Labbé, xiii. 1728), quoting and adopting Basle\r\ndecree, with careful exception for _consuetudines_ of Nativity and\r\nResurrection; cf. ch. xx; _Dioc. C. of Chartres_ (1526, apparently\r\nrepeated 1550, tit. 16; cf. Du Tilliot, 62) quoted Bochellus, iv. 7.\r\n46 ‘denique ab Ecclesia eiiciantur vestes fatuorum personas scenicas\r\nagentium’; _Nat. C. of Paris_ (1528, held by Abp. of Sens as primate),\r\n_Decr. Morum_, c. 16 (Labbé, xiv. 471) ‘prohibemus ne fiat deinceps\r\nfestum fatuorum aut innocentium, neque erigatur decanatus patellae.’\r\nThe _Prov. C. of Rheims_ (1456, held at Soissons) in Labbé, xiii. 1397,\r\nmentions only ‘larvales et theatrales ioci,’ ‘choreae,’ ‘tripudia,’ but\r\nrefers explicitly to the Pragmatic Sanction. This, it may be observed,\r\nwas suspended for a while in 1461 and finally annulled in 1516. Still\r\nmore general are the terms of the _C. of Orleans_ (1525, repeated 1587;\r\nDu Tilliot, 61); _C. of Narbonne_ (1551), c. 46 (Labbé, xv. 26); _C.\r\nof Beauvais_ (1554; E. Fleury, _Cinquante Ans de Laon_, 53); _C. of\r\nCambrai_ (1565), vi. 11 (Labbé, xv. 160); _C. of Rheims_ (1583), c. 5\r\n(Labbé, xv. 889); _C. of Tours_ (1583, quoted Bochellus, iv. 7. 40).\r\nSee also the councils quoted as to the Boy Bishop, in ch. xv. Finally,\r\nthe _C. of Trent_, although in its 22nd session (1562) it renewed the\r\ndecrees of popes and councils ‘de choreis, aleis, lusibus’ (_Decr. de\r\nReformatione_, c. 1), made no specific mention of ‘fatui’ (_Can. et\r\nDecr. Sacros. Oec. Conc. Tridentini_, (Romae, 1845), 127). Probably the\r\nrange of the feast was by this time insignificant.\r\n\r\n[1057] Cf. ch. xvi.\r\n\r\n[1058] But there was another revel on Aug. 28. F. L. Chartier,\r\n_L’ancien Chapitre de N.-D. de Paris_, 175, quotes _Archives\r\nNationales_, LL. 288, p. 219 ‘iniunctum est clericis matutinalibus, ne\r\nin festo S. Augustini faciant dissolutiones quas facere assueverant\r\nannis praeteritis.’\r\n\r\n[1059] Dulaure, _Hist. de Paris_, iii. 81; Grenier, 370. A ‘cardinal’\r\nwas chosen on Jan. 13, and took part in the office.\r\n\r\n[1060] Grenier, 362. A model account form has the heading ‘in die\r\nCircumcisionis, si fiat festum stultorum.’ The ‘rubriques du luminaire’\r\nprovide for a distribution of wax to the sub-deacons and choir-clerks.\r\n\r\n[1061] Martonne, 49, giving no authority.\r\n\r\n[1062] Grenier, 361; Dreves, 583; Rigollot, 15, quoting _Actum Capit._\r\nLeave was given to John Cornet, of St. Michael’s, John de Nœux of St.\r\nMaurice’s, rectors, and Everard Duirech, _capellanus_ of the cathedral,\r\n‘pridem electi, instituti et assumpti in papatum stultorum villae\r\nAmbianensis ... quod dictus Cornet ... et sui praedecessores in ipso\r\npapatu ordinati superstites die circumcisionis Domini ... facerent\r\nprandium in quo beneficiati ipsius villae convocarentur ... ut\r\ninibi eligere instituere et ordinare valerent papam ac papatum\r\nrelevarent absque tamen praeiudicio in aliquo tangendo servitium\r\ndivinum ... faciendum.’ Apparently the parochial clergy of Amiens\r\njoined with the cathedral vicars and chaplains in the feast.\r\n\r\n[1063] Grenier, 362; Rigollot, 15 ‘Servitium divinum facient honeste\r\nin choro ecclesiae solemne, absque faciendo insolentias aut aliquas\r\nirrisiones, nec deferendo aliquas campanas in dicta ecclesia, aut\r\nalibi, et si dicti vicarii facere voluerint aliqua convivia, erit eorum\r\nsumptibus et non sumptibus Dominorum canonicorum.’\r\n\r\n[1064] Rigollot, 16 ‘inhibuerunt capellanis et vicariis ... facere\r\nrecreationes solitas in pascha annotino, etiam facere electionem de\r\nPapa Stultorum.’ Later in the year the ‘iocalia Papae, videlicet\r\nannulus aureus, tassara (_sic_) argentea et sigillum’ were put in\r\ncharge of the ‘canonicus vicarialis.’\r\n\r\n[1065] Rigollot, 17 ‘licentiam dederunt ... ludere die dominica proxima\r\nbrioris.’ Rigollot and Leber think that ‘brioris’ may be for ‘burarum,’\r\nthe feast of ‘buras’ or ‘brandons’ on the first Sunday in Lent. Can it\r\nbe the same as the ‘fête des Braies’ of Laon?\r\n\r\n[1066] Grenier, 414; Rigollot, 17.\r\n\r\n[1067] L. Maziére, _Noyon Religieux_ in _Comptes-Rendus et Mémoires_ of\r\nthe _Comité arch. et hist. de Noyon_ (1895), xi. 92; Grenier, 370, 413;\r\nRigollot, 28, quoting _Actum Capit._ of 1497 ‘cavere a cantu carminum\r\ninfamium et scandalosorum, nec non similiter carminibus indecoris et\r\nimpudicis verbis in ultimo festo Innocentium per eos fetide decantatis;\r\net si vicarii cum rege vadant ad equitatum solito, nequaquam fiet\r\nchorea et tripudia ante magnum portale, saltem ita impudice ut fieri\r\nsolet.’\r\n\r\n[1068] Grenier, 365; Rigollot, 29, quoting, I think, a ceremonial\r\n(1350) of the collegiate church of Saint-Pierre-au-Parvis. The masquers\r\nobtained permission from some canons seated on a theatre near the house\r\ncalled _Grosse-Tête_.\r\n\r\n[1069] Grenier, 365; Rigollot, 26; Dreves, 584, quoting cathedral\r\n_Actum Capit._ of 19 Dec. 1403, from Grenier’s _MS. Picardie_, 158.\r\nFive canons said ‘quod papa fieret in ecclesia, sed nulla elevatio, et\r\nquod, qui vellet venire, in habitu saeculari honesto veniret, et quod\r\nnulla dansio ibi fieret’; but the casting-vote of the dean was against\r\nthem, ‘sed extra possent facere capellani et alii quidquid vellent.’\r\n\r\n[1070] Grenier, 370; Rigollot, 22; E. Fleury, _Cinquante Ans de Laon_,\r\n16; C. Hidé, in _Bull. de la Soc. académique de Laon_ (1863), xiii. 111.\r\n\r\n[1071] Hidé, _op. cit._ 116, thinks that the Patriarch used _jetons\r\nde présence_, similar to those used by the Boy Bishop at Amiens and\r\nelsewhere (ch. xv). He figures some, but they may belong to the period\r\nof the _confrérie_.\r\n\r\n[1072] _MS. Hist._ of Dom. Bugniatre (eighteenth century) quoted\r\nFleury, _op. cit._ 16. I do not feel sure that the term ‘fête des ânes’\r\nwas really used at Laon.\r\n\r\n[1073] Julleville, _Les Com._ 36; _Rép. Com._ 348; L. Paris,\r\n_Remensiana_, 32, _Le Théâtre à Reims_, 30; Coquillart, _Œuvres_ (Bibl.\r\nElzév.), i. cxxxv. Coquillart is said to have written verses for the\r\nBasoche on this occasion.\r\n\r\n[1074] Rigollot, 211, from A. Hugo, _La France pittoresque_, ii. 226,\r\non the authority of a register of 1570 in the cathedral archives.\r\n\r\n[1075] It begins ‘Cantemus ad honorem, gloriam et laudem Sancti\r\nStephani.’\r\n\r\n[1076] L. Deschamps de Pas, in _Mém. de la Soc. des Antiq. de la\r\nMorinie_, xx. 104, 107, 133; O. Bled, in _Bull.

Grenier, 414, citing Sammarthanus, _Gallia\r\nChristiana_, x. 1510, calls Francis de Melun ‘bishop of Terouanne.’\r\nAn earlier reform of the feast seems implied by the undated Chapter\r\nStatute in Ducange, s. v. _Episcopus Fatuorum_ ‘quia temporibus\r\nretroactis multi defectus et plura scandala, deordinationes et mala,\r\noccasione Episcopi Fatuorum et suorum evenerint, statuimus et ordinamus\r\nquod de caetero in festo Circumcisionis Domini Vicarii caeterique\r\nchorum frequentantes et eorum Episcopus se habeant honeste, cantando et\r\nofficiando sicut continetur plenius in Ordinario Ecclesiae.’\r\n\r\n[1079] De la Fons-Melicocq, _Cérémonies dramatiques et Anciens Usages\r\ndans les Eglises du Nord de la France_ (1850), 4. In 1445 is a payment\r\nto the ‘évêque des fous de Saint-Aldegonde’ for a ‘jeu’; in 1474, one\r\nfor the chapter’s share of ‘le feste du vesque des asnes, par dessus\r\ntout ce que ly cœurz paya.’\r\n\r\n[1080] E.

Capit. S. Petri Insul._\r\nJuly 13, 1531, ex Reg. k.) ‘Scandala et ludibria quae sub Fatuitatis\r\npraetextu per beneficiatos et habituatos dictae nostrae ecclesiae\r\na vigilia usque ad completas octavas Epiphaniae fieri et exerceri\r\nconsueverunt ... deinceps nullus nominetur, assumatur et creetur\r\npraelatus follorum, nec ludus, quem Deposuit vocant, in dicta vigilia,\r\naut alio quocumque tempore, ludatur, exerceatur, aut fiat.’ Probably\r\nto this date belongs the very similarly worded but undated memorandum\r\nin Delobel, _Collectanea_, f. 76, which Hautcœur, _Hist._ ii. 220,\r\n224, assigns to 1490. This adds ‘de non ... faciendo officio ... per\r\nvicarios in octava Epiphaniae.’ The municipal duties of the _praelatus_\r\nfell to the _confrérie_ of the Prince des Foux, afterwards Prince\r\nd’Amour, which held revels in 1547 (Du Tilliot, 87), and still later to\r\nthe ‘fou de la ville’ who led the procession of the Holy Sacrament, and\r\nflung water at the people in the eighteenth century (Leber, ix. 265).\r\n\r\n[1083] Rigollot, 14.\r\n\r\n[1084] Two documents are preserved, each giving a full account of the\r\nevent: (_a_) summons of the delinquents before the Parlement, dated\r\nMarch 16, 149⁸⁄₉ (J. F. Foppens, _Supplément_ (1748), to A. Miraeus,\r\n_Opera Diplomatica_, iv. 295). This is endorsed with some notes of\r\nfurther proceedings; (_b_) official notes of the hearing on Nov. 18,\r\n1499 (_Bibl. de l’École des Chartes_, iii. 568); cf. Julleville,\r\n_Rép. com._ 355; Cousin, _Hist. de Tournay_, Bk. iv. 261. The Synod\r\nof Tournai in 1520 still found it necessary to forbid students to\r\nappear in church ‘en habits de fous, en représentant des personnages de\r\ncomédie’ on St. Nicholas’ day, Innocents’ day, or ‘la fête de l’évêque’\r\n(E. Fleury, _Cinquante Ans de Laon_, 54).\r\n\r\n[1085] Rigollot, 19, 157.\r\n\r\n[1086] Cf. ch. xix.\r\n\r\n[1087] Martene, iii. 41 ‘[at second Vespers] Cantor ... dicit ter\r\n_Deposuit_ baculum tenens, et si baculus capitur, _Te Deum Laudamus_\r\nincipietur ... [at Compline] ascendunt duo clerici super formam\r\nthesaurarii et cantant _Haec est sancta dies_, &c. et post _Conserva\r\nDeus_, et dum canitur verberant eum clerici baculis, et ante eos\r\ncantores festi et erupitores.... Post incipit cantor novus _Verbum caro\r\nfactum est_, et hoc cantando ducunt eum in domum suam per parietes cum\r\nbaculis feriendo. Si autem baculus non accipitur, nihil de iis dicitur,\r\nsed vadunt, et extinguitur luminare.’\r\n\r\n[1088] Cf. Appendix L.\r\n\r\n[1089] Chérest, 9, 55, quoting _Acta Capit._ (1453) ‘item circa festum\r\nInnocentium ordinatum est quod in ecclesia nullae fient insolenciae\r\nseu derisiones potissime tempore divini servitii et quod pulsentur\r\nmatutinae non ante quartam horam. Permittimus tamen quod reverenter\r\net in habitu ecclesiastico per Innocentes et alios iuvenes de sedibus\r\ninferioribus dictum fiat officium, saltem circa ea quae sine sacris\r\nordinibus possunt exerceri’; (1510) ‘item turpem illum abusum festi\r\nfatuorum in nostra hactenus ecclesia, proh dolor, frequentatum quo\r\nin celebritate sanctorum Innocentium quidam sub nomine patriarchali\r\ndivinum celebrant officium, penitus detestamus, abolemus et\r\ninterdicimus.’\r\n\r\n[1090] Lebeuf, _Mém. concernant l’Histoire ... d’Auxerre_ (ed. Challe\r\net Quantin, 1848-55), ii. 30; iv. 232 (quoting _Acta Capit._ partly\r\nextracted by Ducange, s.v. _Kalendae_); and in Leber, ix. 358, 375, 385.\r\n\r\n[1091] ‘Cum domini nostri rex et alii regales Franciae sint valde\r\ndolorosi, propter nova armaturae factae in partibus Ungariae contra\r\nSaracenos et inimicos fidei’; cf. Bury-Gibbon, vii. 35.\r\n\r\n[1092] ‘Ordinavit quod de caetero omnes, qui de festo fatuorum fuerint,\r\nnon pulsent campanam capituli sui post prandium, dempta prima die in\r\nqua suum episcopum eligent, et etiam quod in suis sermonibus fatuis non\r\nponant seu dicant aliqua opprobria in vituperium alicuius personae.’\r\n\r\n[1093] Lebeuf, _Hist. d’Auxerre_, ii. 30.\r\n\r\n[1094] I suppose the intended action took shape in the _Quinque\r\nConclusiones_ of Gerson (p. 292), in which he quotes the dictum of\r\nan Auxerre preacher that the feast of Fools was as _approbatum_ as\r\nthat of the Conception. To this there seems to be a reference in\r\nthe account of the Abbot of Pontigny’s sermon in the _Acta Capit._\r\n‘praedicavit ... quod dictum festum non erat, nec unquam fuerat a Deo\r\nnec Ecclesia approbandum seu approbatum.’ Lebeuf, in Leber, ix. 385,\r\npoints out that Gerson was intimate with one member of the Auxerre\r\nchapter. This was Nicolas de Clamengis, whose _Opera_, 151 (ed. Lydius,\r\n1613), include a treatise _De novis celebritatibus non instituendis_,\r\nin which the suppression of feasts in his diocese by Michael of Auxerre\r\nis alluded to.\r\n\r\n[1095] These were canons of inferior rank at Auxerre (Ducange, s. v.\r\n_tortarius_).\r\n\r\n[1096] Canons J. Boileaue, Devisco, Pavionis, Viandi and H. Desnoes.\r\nWas Viandi the canon John Vivien who, according to Lebeuf, _Hist.\r\nd’Auxerre_, iv. 234, noted on his Breviary (now _Bibl. Nat. Cod.\r\nColbert._ 4227) that at first Vespers on the Circumcision, _Hodie\r\nChristus_ was sung after each Psalm, ‘quia Festum Circumcisionis\r\nvocatur in diversis ecclesiis festum Fatuorum’?\r\n\r\n[1097] Chérest, 76; Julleville, _Les Com._ 234; Lebeuf, in Leber,\r\nix. 358, 373, quoting a _Cry pour l’abbé de l’église d’Ausserre et\r\nses supposts_, from the _Œuvres_ of Roger de Collerye (1536). This\r\nresembles the productions of the _confréries des fous_ (cf. ch. xvi)\r\nand begins,\r\n\r\n    ‘Sortez, saillez, venez de toutes parts,\r\n     Sottes et sots plus prompts que liépars.’\r\n\r\n[1098] Dunot de Charnage, _Hist. de Besançon_, i. 227; Rigollot, 47;\r\nLeber, ix. 434; x. 40.\r\n\r\n[1099] The anonymous author of the _Histoire de l’Église d’Autun_\r\n(1774), 462, 628, gives _probata_ from the _Acta Capitularia_ for some,\r\nbut not all of his statements. Du Tilliot, 24 and possibly Ducange, s.\r\nv. _Festum Asinorum_ appear also to have seen at least one register\r\nkept by the _rotarius_ which covered the period 1411 to 1416.\r\n\r\n[1100] ‘Deliberaverunt super festo folorum quod fieri consuevit anno\r\nquolibet in festo Circumcisionis Domini, ad resecandum superfluitates\r\net derisiones quae fieri consueverunt ... item quod amodo non adducatur\r\nasinus ad processionem dictae diei, ut fuit solitum fieri, nec dicatur\r\ncantilena quae dici solebat super dictum asinum, et supra officio\r\nquod fieri consuetum est dicta die in Ecclesia dicti Domini postea\r\nprovidebunt.’ Ducange says that the ass had a golden foot-cloth of\r\nwhich four of the principal canons held the corners. On the _cantilena_\r\ncf. Appendix L.\r\n\r\n[1101] ‘Ordinaverunt quod festum folorum penitus cesset.’\r\n\r\n[1102] ‘Concluserunt ad requestum stultorum quod hoc anno fiat festum\r\nfolorum ... cum solemnitatibus in dicto festo requisitis in libris\r\ndicti festi descriptis ... qui defecerit in matutinis et aliis horis\r\nstatutis comburatur in fonte.’\r\n\r\n[1103] ‘In fine Matutinarum nonnulli larvati alii inordinate vestiti\r\nchoreas, tripudia et saltus in eadem ecclesia faciunt ... [aliquos] ad\r\nfontem deferunt et ibi aqua intinguntur.’\r\n\r\n[1104] Cf. ch. xix. A representation of the ‘Flight into Egypt’\r\nmight well come into a play of Herod. The _Hist. d’Autun_, 462, says\r\nthat, before the reform of 1411, the ass appeared as Balaam’s ass in\r\nconnexion with a _Prophetae_ on a stage at the church door. There was a\r\nprocession to church, and the Prose. The _rex_ received a cheese from\r\nthe chapter.\r\n\r\n[1105] Cf. ch. xv.\r\n\r\n[1106] ‘Regna Herodis et Episcopatus Innocentium, seu fatuorum festa\r\nhactenus ... fieri solita ... abolentes.’\r\n\r\n[1107] ‘Quod vulgo dicitur _Les Gaigizons_ ... amplius neminem balneare\r\naut ... pignus aufferre.’ It is here only the choice of ‘bishop’ and\r\n‘dean’ of Innocents, ‘quod festum fatuorum a nonnullis nuncupatur’ that\r\nis forbidden. Apparently ‘Herod’ had died out.\r\n\r\n[1108] Du Tilliot, 100; Petit de Julleville, _Les Com._ 194.

But that in the Franciscan convent at Antibes is the\r\nonly actual instance I have come across.\r\n\r\n[1144] There were _canonici presbiteri_, _diaconi_, _subdiaconi_ and\r\neven _pueri_ at Salisbury (W. H. Frere, _Use of Sarum_, i. 51).\r\n\r\n[1145] On the nature and growth of vicars choral, cf. Cutts, 341; W.\r\nH. Frere, _Use of Sarum_, i. xvii; _Lincoln Statutes_, passim; A. R.\r\nMaddison, _Vicars Choral of Lincoln_ (1878); H. E. Reynolds, _Wells\r\nCathedral_, xxix, cvii, clxx. Vicars choral make their appearance in\r\nthe eleventh century as choir substitutes for non-resident canons. At\r\nLincoln they got benefactions from about 1190, and in the thirteenth\r\ncentury formed a regularly organized _communitas_. The _vicarii_ were\r\noften at the same time _capellani_ or chantry-priests. On chantries see\r\nCutts, 438.\r\n\r\n[1146] The Lincoln vicars chose two Provosts yearly (Maddison, _op.\r\ncit._); the Wells vicars two Principals (Reynolds, _op. cit._ clxxi).\r\n\r\n[1147] Reynolds, _op. cit._, gives numerous and interesting notices of\r\nchapter discipline from the Wells _Liber Ruber_.\r\n\r\n[1148] In Leber, ix. 379, 407, is described a curious way of raising\r\nfunds for choir suppers, known at Auxerre and in Auvergne, and not\r\nquite extinct in the eighteenth century. It has a certain analogy\r\nto the _Deposuit_. From Christmas to Epiphany the Psalm _Memento_\r\nwas sung at Vespers, and the anthem _De fructu ventris_ inserted in\r\nit. When this began the ruler of the choir advanced and presented a\r\nbouquet to some canon or _bourgeois_ as a sign that the choir would\r\nsup with him. This was called ‘annonce en forme d’antienne,’ and the\r\nsuppers _defructus_. The _C. of Narbonne_ (1551), c. 47, forbade\r\n‘parochis ... ne ... ad commessationes quas defructus appellant, ullo\r\nmodo parochianos suos admittant, nec permittant quempiam canere ut\r\ndicunt: Memento, Domine, _David sans truffe_, &c. Nec alia huiusmodi\r\nridenda, quae in contemptum divini officii ac in dedecus et probrum\r\ntotius cleri et fiunt et cantantur.’\r\n\r\n[1149] When, however, Ducange says that the feast was not called\r\n_Subdiaconorum_, because the sub-deacons held it, but rather as being\r\n‘ebriorum Clericorum seu Diaconorum: id enim evincit vox _Soudiacres_,\r\nid est, ad litteram, _Saturi Diaconi_, quasi _Diacres Saouls_,’ we must\r\ntake it for a ‘sole joke of Thucydides.’ I believe there is also a joke\r\nsomewhere in Liddell and Scott.\r\n\r\n[1150] Cf. p. 60; Gautier, _Les Tropaires_, i. 186; and _C. of Treves_\r\nin 1227 (J. F. Schannat, _Conc. Germ._ iii. 532) ‘praecipimus ut\r\nomnes Sacerdotes non permittant trutannos et alios vagos scolares aut\r\ngoliardos cantare versus super _Sanctus_ et _Agnus Dei_.’\r\n\r\n[1151] The ‘abbot’ appears to have been sometimes charged with choir\r\ndiscipline throughout the year, and at Vienne and Viviers exists side\r\nby side with another _dominus festi_. Similarly at St. Omer there was\r\na ‘dean’ as well as a ‘bishop.’ The vicars of Lincoln and Wells also\r\nchose two officers.\r\n\r\n[1152] I suppose that ‘portetur in rost’ at Vienne means that the\r\nvictims were roasted like the fags in _Tom Brown_.\r\n\r\n[1153] Ducange, s. v. _Kalendae_.\r\n\r\n[1154] Gibbon-Bury, v. 201.

He is not speaking here of the\r\nFeast of Fools.\r\n\r\n[1159] e.g. Du Tilliot, 2.\r\n\r\n[1160] S. R. Maitland, _The Dark Ages_, 141, tilts at the Protestant\r\nhistorian Robertson’s _History of Charles V_, as do F. Clément,\r\n159, and A. Walter, _Das Eselsfest_ in _Caecilien-Kalender_ (1885),\r\n75, at Dulaure, _Hist. des Environs de Paris_, iii. 509, and other\r\n‘Voltairiens.’\r\n\r\n[1161] Chérest, 81.\r\n\r\n[1162] J. Bujeaud, _Chants et Chansons populaires des Provinces de\r\nl’Ouest_, i. 63. The _ronde_ is known in Poitou, Aunis, Angoumois. P.\r\nTarbé, _Romancero de Champagne_ (2^e partie), 257, gives a variant.\r\nBujeaud, i. 61, gives another _ronde_, the _Testament de l’Âne_, in\r\nwhich the ass has fallen into a ditch, and amongst other legacies\r\nleaves his tail to the _curé_ for an _aspersoir_. This is known in\r\nPoitou, Angoumois, Franche-Comté. He also says that he has heard\r\nchildren of Poitou and Angoumois go through a mock catechism, giving an\r\necclesiastical significance to each part of the ass. The tail is the\r\n_goupillon_, and so forth. Fournier-Verneuil, _Paris, Tableau moral et\r\nphilosophique_ (1826), 522, with the Beauvais _Officium_ in his mind,\r\nsays ‘Voulez-vous qu’au lieu de dire, _Ite, missa est_, le prêtre se\r\nmette à braire trois fois de toute sa force, et que le peuple réponde\r\nen chœur, comme je l’ai vu faire en 1788, dans l’église de Bellaigues,\r\nen Périgord?’\r\n\r\n[1163] Cf. ch. xx. Gasté, 20, considers the Rouen _Festum Asinorum_\r\n‘l’origine de toutes les Fêtes de l’Âne qui se célébraient dans\r\nd’autres diocèses’: but the Rouen MS. in which it occurs is only of\r\nthe fourteenth century, and the Balaam episode does not occur at all\r\nin the more primitive forms of the _Prophetae_, while the Sens Feast\r\nof Fools is called the _festa asinaria_ in the _Officium_ of the early\r\nthirteenth century.\r\n\r\n[1164] Tille, _D. W._ 31. In Madrid an ass was led in procession on\r\nJan. 17, with anthems on the Balaam legend (Clément, 181).\r\n\r\n[1165] Clément, 182; Didron, _Annales archéologiques_, xv. 384.\r\n\r\n[1166] Dulaure, _Hist. des Environs de Paris_, iii. 509, quotes a\r\nlegend to the effect that the very ass ridden by Christ came ultimately\r\nto Verona, died there, was buried in a wooden effigy at S^{ta}-Maria in\r\nOrgano, and honoured by a yearly procession. He guesses at this as the\r\norigin of the Beauvais and other _fêtes_. Didron, _Annales arch._ xv.\r\n377, xvi. 33, found that nothing was known of this legend at Verona,\r\nthough such a statue group as is described above apparently existed\r\nin the church named. Dulaure gives as his authorities F. M. Misson,\r\n_Nouveau Voyage d’ Italie_ (1731), i. 164; _Dict. de l’ Italie_, i.\r\n56. Misson’s visit to Verona was in 1687, although the passage was not\r\nprinted in the first edition (1691) of his book. It is in the English\r\ntranslation of 1714 (i. 198). _His_ authority was a French merchant\r\n(M. Montel) living in Verona, who had often seen the procession. In\r\n_Cenni intorno all’ origine e descrizione della Festa che annualmente\r\nsi celebra in Verona l’ ultimo Venerdì del Carnovale, comunamente\r\ndenominata Gnoccolare_ (1818), 75, is a mention of the ‘asinello\r\ndel vecchio padre Sileno’ which served as a mount for the ‘Capo de’\r\nMaccheroni.’ This is probably Misson’s procession, but there is no\r\nmention of the legend in any of the eighteenth-century accounts quoted\r\nin the pamphlet. Rienzi was likened to an ‘Abbate Asinino’ (Gibbon,\r\nvii. 269).\r\n\r\n[1167] Ducange, s. v. _Festum Asinorum_; cf. Leber, ix. 270; Molanus,\r\n_de Hist. SS. Imaginum et Picturarum_ (1594), iv. 18.\r\n\r\n[1168] T. Naogeorgus (Kirchmeyer), _The Popish Kingdom_, iv. 443\r\n(1553, transl. Barnabe Googe, 1570, in New Shakspere Society edition\r\nof Stubbes, _Anatomy of Abuses_, i. 332); cf. _Beehive of the Roman\r\nChurch_, 199. The earliest notice is in Gerardus, _Leben St. Ulrichs\r\nvon Augsburg_ (ob. 973), c. 4. E. Bishop, in _Dublin Review_, cxxiii.\r\n405, traces the custom in a Prague fourteenth-century _Missal_ and\r\nsixteenth-century _Breviary_; also in the modern Greek Church at Moscow\r\nwhere until recently the Czar held the bridle. But there is no ass, as\r\nhe says, in the Palm Sunday ceremony described in the _Peregrinatio\r\nSilviae_ (Duchesne, 486).\r\n\r\n[1169] A peeress of the realm lately stated that this custom had been\r\nintroduced in recent years into the Anglican church. Denials were to\r\nhand, and an amazing conflict of evidence resulted. Is there any proof\r\nthat the _Palmesel_ was ever an English ceremony at all? The Hereford\r\nriding of 1706 (cf. _Representations_) was not in the church. Brand,\r\ni. 73, quotes _A Dialogue: the Pilgremage of Pure Devotyon_ (1551?),\r\n‘Upon Palme Sondaye they play the foles sadely, drawynge after them\r\nan Asse in a rope, when they be not moche distante from the Woden\r\nAsse that they drawe.’ Clearly this, like Googe’s translation of\r\nNaogeorgus, is a description of contemporary continental Papistry.\r\nW. Fulke, _The Text of the New Testament_ (ed. 1633), 76 (_ad Marc._\r\nxi. 8) quotes a note of the Rheims translation to the effect that in\r\nmemory of the entry into Jerusalem is a procession on Palm Sunday\r\n‘with the blessed Sacrament reverently carried as it were Christ upon\r\nthe Asse,’ and comments, ‘But it is pretty sport, that you make the\r\nPriest that carrieth the idoll, to supply the roome of the Asse on\r\nwhich Christ did ride.... Thus you turn the holy mysterie of Christ’s\r\nriding to Jerusalem to a May-game and Pageant-play.’ Fulke, who lived\r\n1538-89, is evidently unaware that there was an ass, as well as the\r\npriest, in the procession, from which I infer that the custom was not\r\nknown in England. Not that this consideration would weigh with the\r\nmediaevally-minded curate, who is as a rule only too ready to make up\r\nby the ceremonial inaccuracy of his mummeries for the offence which\r\nthey cause to his congregation.\r\n\r\n[1170] Marquardt-Mommsen, vi. 191; Jevons, _Plutarch’s Romane\r\nQuestions_, 134; Fowler, 304, 322; Ovid, _Fasti_, ii. 531:\r\n\r\n    ‘stultaque pars populi, quae sit sua curia, nescit;\r\n      sed facit extrema sacra relata die.’\r\n\r\n[1171] Fowler, 306.\r\n\r\n[1172] Schaff, iii. 131.\r\n\r\n[1173] Belethus, c. 70 ‘Debent ergo vesperae Natalis primo integre\r\ncelebrari, ac postea conveniunt diaconi quasi in tripudio, cantantque\r\n_Magnificat_ cum antiphona de S. Stephano, sed sacerdos recitat\r\ncollectam. Nocturnos et universum officium crastinum celebrant\r\ndiaconi, quod Stephanus fuerit diaconus, et ad lectiones concedunt\r\nbenedictiones, ita tamen, ut eius diei missam celebret hebdomarius,\r\nhoc est ille cuius tum vices fuerint eam exsequi. Sic eodem modo\r\nomne officium perficient sacerdotes ipso die B. Ioannis, quod hic\r\nsacerdos fuerit, et pueri in ipso festo Innocentium, quia innocentes\r\npro Christo occisi sunt, ... in festo itaque Innocentium penitus\r\nsubticentur cantica laetitiae, quoniam ii ad inferos descenderunt.’\r\nCf. also c. 72, quoted on p. 275. Durandus, _Rat. Div. Off._ (1284),\r\nvii. 42, _De festis SS. Stephani, Ioannis Evang. et Innocentium_, gives\r\na similar account. At Vespers on Christmas Day, he says, the deacons\r\n‘in tripudio convenientes cantant antiphonam de sancto Stephano, et\r\nsacerdos collectam. Nocturnos autem et officium in crastinum celebrant\r\net benedictiones super lectiones dant: quod tamen facere non debent.’\r\nSo too for the priests and boys on the following days.\r\n\r\n[1174] Honorius Augustodunensis, _Gemma Animae_, iii. 12 (_P.

L._ cxlvii. 41), with fairly full account of the ‘officia.’\r\n\r\n[1176] Ekkehardus IV, _de Casibus S. Galli_, c. 14 (ed. G. Meyer von\r\nKnonau, in _Mittheilungen zur vaterländischen Gesch._ of the Hist.\r\nVerein in St. Gallen, N. F., v.; _M. G. H. Scriptores_, ii. 84)\r\n‘longum est dicere, quibus iocunditatibus dies exegerit et noctes,\r\nmaxime in processione infantum; quibus poma in medio ecclesiae\r\npavimento antesterni iubens, cum nec unum parvissimorum moveri nec ad\r\nea adtendere vidisset, miratus est disciplinam.’ Ekkehart was master\r\nof the song-school, and von Knonau mentions some _cantiones_ written\r\nby him and others for the feast, e.g. one beginning ‘Salve lacteolo\r\ndecoratum sanguine festum.’ He has another story (c. 26) of how Solomon\r\nwho was abbot of the monastery, as well as bishop of Constance, looking\r\ninto the song-school on the ‘dies scolarium,’ when the boys had a\r\n‘ius ... ut hospites intrantes capiant, captos, usque dum se redimant,\r\nteneant,’ was duly made prisoner, and set on the master’s seat. ‘Si in\r\nmagistri solio sedeo,’ cried the witty bishop, ‘iure eius uti habeo.\r\nOmnes exuimini.’ After his jest, he paid his footing like a man. The\r\n‘Schulabt’ of St. Gall is said to have survived until the council of\r\nTrent.\r\n\r\n[1177] Frere, _Winch. Troper_, 6, 8, 10. The deacons sang ‘Eia,\r\nconlevitae in protomartyris Stephani natalicio ex persona ipsius\r\ncum psalmista ouantes concinnamus’; the priests, ‘Hodie candidati\r\nsacerdotum chori centeni et milleni coniubilent Christo dilectoque suo\r\nIohanni’; the boys, ‘Psallite nunc Christo pueri, dicente propheta.’\r\n\r\n[1178] Rock, iii. 2. 214; Clément, 118; Grenier, 353; Martene, iii.\r\n38. These writers add several references for the _triduum_ or one\r\nor other of its feasts to those here given: e.g. Martene quotes on\r\nSt. Stephen’s feast _Ordinarium of Langres_, ‘finitis vesperis fiunt\r\ntripudia’; _Ordinarium of Limoges_, ‘vadunt omnes ad capitulum, ubi\r\nEpiscopus, sive praesens, sive absens fuerit, dat eis potum ex tribus\r\nvinis’; _Ordinarium of Strasburg_ (†1364), ‘propinatur in refectorio,\r\nsicut in vigilia nativitatis.’\r\n\r\n[1179] Martene, iii. 38 ‘tria festa, quae sequuntur, fiunt cum magna\r\nsolemnitate et tripudio. Primum faciunt diaconi, secundum presbiteri,\r\ntertium pueri.’\r\n\r\n[1180] Grenier, 353 ‘si festa [S. Stephani] fiant, ut consuetum est, a\r\ndiaconis in cappis sericis ... fit statio in medio choro, et ab ipsis\r\nregitur chorus ... et fiant festa sicut docent libri’; and so for the\r\ntwo other feasts.\r\n\r\n[1181] Martene, iii. 38 ‘cum in primis vesperis [in festo S. Stephani]\r\nad illum cantici _Magnificat_ versiculum _Deposuit potentes_ perventum\r\nerat, cantor baculum locumque suum diacono, qui pro eo chorum regeret,\r\ncedebat’; and so on the other feasts.\r\n\r\n[1182] Cf. p. 315.\r\n\r\n[1183] Durr, 77. Here the sub-deacons shared in the deacons’ feast.\r\n\r\n[1184] The _Consuetudinarium_ of †1210 (Frere, _Use of Sarum_, i. 124,\r\n223) mentions the procession of deacons after Vespers on Christmas\r\nday, but says nothing of the share of the priests and boys in those\r\nof the following days. The _Sarum Breviary_ gives all three (Fasc. i.\r\ncols. cxcv, ccxiii, ccxxix), and has a note (col. clxxvi) ‘nunquam enim\r\ndicitur Prosa ad Matutinas per totum annum, sed ad Vesperas, et ad\r\nProcessionem, excepto die sancti Stephani, cuius servitium committitur\r\nvoluntati Diaconorum; et excepto die sancti Iohannis, cuius servitium\r\ncommittitur voluntati Sacerdotum; et excepto die sanctorum Innocentium,\r\ncuius servitium committitur voluntati Puerorum.’\r\n\r\n[1185] _York Missal_, i. 20, 22, 23 (from fifteenth-century MS. _D_\r\nused in the Minster) ‘_In die S.

L._ ccxii.\r\n73) ‘quoniam festivitas beati protomartyris Stephani eiusdem fere\r\nsubiacebat dissolutionis et temeritatis incommodo, nec ita solemniter,\r\nsicut decebat et martyris merita requirebant, in Ecclesia Parisiensi\r\nconsueverat celebrari, nos, qui eidem martyri sumus specialiter\r\ndebitores, quoniam in Ecclesia Bituricensi patronum habuerimus,\r\nin cuius gremio ab ineunte aetate fuimus nutriti; de voluntate et\r\nassensu dilectorum nostrorum Hugonis decani et capituli Parisiensis,\r\nfestivitatem ipsam ad statum reducere regularem, eumque magnis\r\nEcclesiae solemnitatibus adnumerare decrevimus; statuentes ut in ipso\r\nfesto tantum celebritatis agatur, quantum in ceteris festis annualibus\r\nfieri consuevit.’ Eudes de Sully made a donative to the canons and\r\nclerks present at Matins on the feast, which his successor Petrus\r\nde Nemore confirmed in 1208 (_P. L._ ccxii. 91). Dean Hugo Clemens\r\ninstigated a similar reform of St. John’s day (see p. 276).\r\n\r\n[1191] Martene, iii. 40; Grenier, 353, 412. The _Ritual_ of Bishop\r\nNivelon, at the end of the twelfth century, orders St. Stephen’s to be\r\nkept as a triple feast, ‘exclusa antiqua consuetudine diaconorum et\r\nludorum.’\r\n\r\n[1192] Schannat, iv. 258 (1316) ‘illud, quod ... causa devotionis\r\nordinatum fuerat ... ut Sacerdotes singulis annis in festivitate Beati\r\nIohannis Evangelistae unum ex se eligant, qui more episcopi illa die\r\nMissam gloriose celebret et festive, nunc in ludibrium vertitur, et in\r\necclesia ludi fiunt theatrales, et non solum in ecclesia introducuntur\r\nmonstra larvarum, verum etiam Presbyteri, Diaconi et Subdiaconi\r\ninsaniae suae ludibria exercere praesumunt, facientes prandia\r\nsumptuosa, et cum tympanis et cymbalis ducentes choreas per domos et\r\nplateas civitatis.’\r\n\r\n[1193] At Rouen in 1445 the feast of St. John, held by the _capellani_,\r\nwas alone in question. The chapter ordered (Gasté, 46) ‘ut faciant die\r\nfesti sancti euangelistae Iohannis servicium divinum bene et honeste,\r\nsine derisionibus et fatuitatibus; et inhibitum fuit eisdem ne habeant\r\nvestes difformes, insuper quod fiat mensa et ponantur boni cantores,\r\nqui bene sciant cantare, omnibus derisionibus cessantibus.’ But in 1446\r\nthe feast of St. Stephen needed reforming, as well as that of St. John\r\n(A. Chéruel, _Hist. de Rouen sous la Domination anglaise_, 206); and in\r\n1451 all three (Gasté, 47) ‘praefati Domini capitulantes ordinaverunt\r\nquod in festis solemnitatis Nativitatis Domini nostri Ihesu Christi\r\nproxime futuris, omnes indecencie et inhonestates consuete fieri in\r\ndedecus ecclesie, tam per presbyteros dyaconos quam pueros chori et\r\nbasse forme, cessent omnino, nec sit aliquis puer in habitu episcopi,\r\nsed fiat servicium devote et honorifice prout in aliis festis similis\r\ngradus.’\r\n\r\n[1194] _C. of Toledo_ (1473), c. 19 (Labbé, xiii. 1460) ‘Quia vero\r\nquaedam tam in Metropolitains quam in Cathedralibus et aliis Ecclesiis\r\nnostrae provinciae consuetudo inolevit ut videlicet in festis\r\nNativitatis Domini nostri Iesu Christi et sanctorum Stephani, Ioannis\r\net Innocentium aliisque certis diebus festivis, etiam in solemnitatibus\r\nMissarum novarum dum divina aguntur, ludi theatrales, larvae,\r\nmonstra, spectacula, necnon quamplurima inhonesta et diversa figmenta\r\nin Ecclesiis introducuntur ... huiusmodi larvas, ludos, monstra,\r\nspectacula, figmenta et tumultuationes fieri ... prohibemus....\r\nPer hoc tam honestas repraesentationes et devotas, quae populum ad\r\ndevotionem movent, tam in praefatis diebus quam in aliis non intendimus\r\nprohibere’; _C. of Lyons_ (1566 and 1577), c. 15 (Du Tilliot, 63) ‘Es\r\njours de Fête des Innocens et autres, l’on ne doit souffrir ès Églises\r\njouer jeux, tragédies, farces, &c.’; cf. the Cologne statutes (1662)\r\nquoted on p. 352.\r\n\r\n[1195] H.

He wishes them\r\n‘Salutem, et morum clericalium honestatem,’ and adds ‘Ad nostram,\r\nnon sine gravi cordis displicencia et stupore, pervenit noticiam\r\nquod, annis praeteritis et quibusdam praecedentibus, in Sanctissimis\r\nDominice Nativitatis, ac Sanctorum Stephani, Iohannis, Apostoli et\r\nEvangelistae, ac Innocencium Solempniis, quando omnes Christi Fideles\r\nDivinis laudibus et Officiis Ecclesiasticis devocius ac quiescius\r\ninsistere tenentur, aliqui praedicte Ecclesie nostre Ministri, cum\r\npueris, nedum Matutinis et Vesperis ac Horis aliis, set, quod magis\r\ndetestandum est, inter Missarum Sollempnia, ludos ineptos et noxios,\r\nhonestatique clericali indecentes, quia verius Cultus Divini ludibria\r\ndetestanda, infra Ecclesiam ipsam inmiscendo committere, Divino\r\ntimore postposito, pernicioso quarundam Ecclesiarum exemplo, temere\r\npraesumpserunt; Vestimenta et alia Ornamenta Ecclesie, in non modicum\r\neiusdem Ecclesie nostre et nostrum dampnum et dedecus, vilium scilicet\r\nscenulentorumque (_or_ scev.) sparsione multipliciter deturpando.

Gasté, 33, gives several Rouen\r\nchapter acts from 1449 to 1457 requiring them to officiate ‘cessantibus\r\nstultitiis et insolenciis.’ These orders and those quoted on p. 341\r\nabove were prompted by the _Letter_ of the Paris theologians against\r\nthe Feast of Fools and similar revels. In 1445 (or 1449) a committee\r\nwas chosen ‘ad videndum et visitandum ordinationem ecclesiae pro festis\r\nNativitatis Domini et deliberationes Facultatis Theologiae super hoc\r\nhabitas et quod tollantur derisiones in ipsis fieri solitas.’\r\n\r\n[1199] At Sarum a _Constitutio_ of Roger de Mortival in 1324 (Dayman\r\nand Jones, _Sarum Statutes_, 52) forbade drinking when the antiphon\r\n‘O Sapientia’ was sung after Compline on Dec. 16. John of Avranches\r\n(†1070) allowed for the feast of his ‘O’ at Rouen ‘unum galonem vini\r\nde cellario archiepiscopi,’ and the ‘vin de l’O’ was still given in\r\n1377 (Gasté, 47). On these ‘Oes,’ sung by the great functionaries of\r\ncathedrals and monasteries, see E. Green, _On the words ‘O Sapientia’\r\nin the Kalendar_ (_Archaeologia_, xlix. 219); Cynewulf, _Christ_ (ed.\r\nA. S. Cook), xxxv. Payments ‘cantoribus ad ludum suum’ or ‘ad’ or ‘ante\r\nnatale’ appear in Durham accounts; cf. _Finchale Priory_ ccccxxviii\r\n(Surtees Soc.,) and _Durham Accounts_, _passim_ (Surtees Soc.).

Hi sunt, qui cum mulieribus non sunt coinquinati,\r\nvirgines enim sunt. Hi sequuntur Agnum quocumque ierit.’ This passage\r\nis still read in the ‘Epistle’ at Mass on Holy Innocents’ day. Cf. the\r\nuse of the same chants at Salisbury (Appendix M).\r\n\r\n[1204] ‘Et tamdiu cantetur _Deposuit potentes_ quod baculus accipiatur\r\nab eo qui accipere voluerit.’\r\n\r\n[1205] _Ordinarium_ of Bayeux (undated) in Gasté, 37.

Episcopo vero,\r\ncantori et aliis canonicis aquam, manutergium, missale, ignem et\r\ncampanam possunt imponere pro suae libito voluntatis. Nihil tamen\r\ninhonestum aut impertinens apponatur; antiquiores primi ponantur in\r\ntabula et ultimi iuniores.’\r\n\r\n[1209] ‘Quo facto dicat [Episcopus] _Deposuit_. Statimque electus\r\nEpiscopus, tradito sibi baculo pastorali a pueris ad altare\r\npraesentetur, et osculato altari in domum suam a dictis pueris\r\ndeferatur.

At second\r\nVespers ‘quando _Magnificat_ canitur, veniunt clericuli in choro cum\r\nepiscopo habentes candelas accensas de proprio et quando _Deposuit_\r\ncanitur, accipit cantor puerorum baculum, et tunc in stallo ascendunt\r\npueri, et alii descendunt.’\r\n\r\n[1211] Ducange, s. v. _Kalendae_.\r\n\r\n[1212] ‘Omnes pueri et subdiaconi feriati, qui in numero dictorum\r\nInnocentium computantur.’\r\n\r\n[1213] ‘Ipsa autem die de mane equitare habet idem episcopus\r\nInnocentium ad monasteria SS.

The M. G. H. editors of Gregory,\r\nhowever, explain ‘_barbatoria_’ as ‘_primam barbam ponere_’ the sense\r\nborne by the term in Petronius, _Sat._ lxxiii. 6. The abbess’s niece\r\nhad probably no beard, but may not the reference be to the cutting of\r\nthe hair of a novice when she takes the vows?\r\n\r\n[1305] Ducange, s. v. _Kalendae_ (‘de monialibus Villae-Arcelli’),\r\n‘Item inhibemus ne de caetero in festis Innocentum et B. M. Magdalenae\r\nludibria exerceatis consueta, induendo vos scilicet vestibus\r\nsaecularium aut inter vos seu cum secularibus choreas ducendo’;\r\nand again ‘in festo S. Iohannis et Innocentium mimia iocositate et\r\nscurrilibus cantibus utebantur, ut pote farsis, conductis, motulis;\r\npraecepimus quod honestius et cum maiori devotione alias se haberent’;\r\nGasté, 36 (on Caen) ‘iuniores in festo Innocentium cantant lectiones\r\nsuas cum farsis. Hoc inhibuimus.’ In 1423, the real abbess gave place\r\nto the little abbess at the _Deposuit_. Gasté, 44, describes a survival\r\nof the election of an ‘abbess’ from amongst the _pensionnaires_ on\r\nthe days of St. Catherine and the Innocents in the Abbaye aux Bois,\r\nFaubourg St. Germain, from the _Mémoires_ of Hélène Massalska. This was\r\nabout 1773.\r\n\r\n[1306] Howlett, _Monumenta Franciscana_ (R. S.), ii. 93 ‘Caveant\r\nfratres in festo Sancti Nicolai seu Innocentium, vel quibuscunque\r\naliis festis vestes extraneas religiosas seu seculares aut clericales\r\nvel muliebres sub specie devotionis induere; nec habitus fratrum\r\nsecularibus pro ludis faciendis accommodentur sub poena amotionis\r\nconfusibilis de conventu.’\r\n\r\n[1307] Denifle, i. 532. It was forbidden ‘in eisdem festis vel aliis\r\nparamenta nec coreas duci in vico de die nec de nocte cum torticiis vel\r\nsine.’ But it was on Innocents’ Day that the _béjaunes_ or ‘freshmen’\r\nof the Sorbonne were subjected to rites bearing a close analogy to\r\nthe feast of fools; cf. Rigollot, 172 ‘1476 ... condemnatus fuit in\r\ncrastino Innocentium capellanus abbas beiannorum ad octo solidos\r\nparisienses, eo quod non explevisset officium suum die Innocentium post\r\nprandium, in mundationem beiannorum per aspersionem aquae ut moris est,\r\nquanquam solemniter incoepisset exercere suum officium ante prandium\r\ninducendo beiannos per vicum super asinum.’\r\n\r\n[1308] Denifle, iii. 166.\r\n\r\n[1309] ‘Verbis nedum gallicis sed eciam latinis, ut ipsi qui de\r\npartibus alienis oriundi linguam gallicam nequaquam intelligebant\r\nplenarie.’\r\n\r\n[1310] S.

C. C. C. C._, Q. 8, quoted\r\nWarton, ii. 230) ‘Hoc anno, 1464, in festo Sancti Nicolai non erat\r\nepiscopus puerorum in schola grammatica in civitate Cantuariae ex\r\ndefectu Magistrorum, viz. I. Sidney et T. Hikson.’\r\n\r\n[1319] J. Stuart, _Extracts from Council Registers of Aberdeen_\r\n(Spalding Club), i. 186. The council ordered on Nov. 27, 1542, ‘that\r\nthe maister of thair grammar scuyll sell haf iiij^s Scottis, of the\r\nsobirest persoun that resauis him and the bischop at Sanct Nicolace\r\nday.’ This is to be held a legal fee, ‘he hes na uder fee to leif on.’\r\n\r\n[1320] Wilkins, _Concilia_, iii. 860 ‘And whereas heretofore dyverse\r\nand many superstitious and childysshe observations have been usid, and\r\nyet to this day are observed and kept in many and sondry parties of\r\nthis realm, as upon sainte Nicolas, sainte Catheryne, sainte Clement,\r\nthe holye Innocentes, and such like; children be strangelye decked\r\nand apparelid to counterfaite priestes, bysshopps, and women; and so\r\nledde with songes and daunces from house to house, bleasing the people,\r\nand gatherynge of monye; and boyes doo singe masse, and preache in\r\nthe pulpitt, with suche other unfittinge and inconvenyent usages,\r\nrather to the derision than to any true glory of God, or honour of his\r\nsaints; the kyng’s majestie therefore mynding nothing so moche, as to\r\navaunce the true glorye of God without vayne superstition, willith and\r\ncommaundeth, that from henceforth all suche superstitions be loste and\r\nclyerlye extinguisshed throughowte all this his realmes and dominions,\r\nforasmoche as the same doo resemble rather the unlawfull superstition\r\nof gentilitie, than the pure and sincere religion of Christe.’ Brand,\r\ni. 236, suggests that there was an earlier proclamation of July 22,\r\n1540, to the same effect. Johan Bale in his _Yet a Course at the\r\nRomyshe Foxe_ (1542), says that if Bonner’s censure of those who lay\r\naside certain ‘auncyent rytes’ is justified, ‘then ought my Lorde also\r\nto suffer the same selfe ponnyshment, for not goynge abought with Saynt\r\nNycolas clarkes.’ Thomas Becon, _Catechism_, 320 (ed. Parker Soc.),\r\ncompares a bishop who does not preach, a ‘dumb dog,’ to a ‘Nicholas\r\nbishop.’ The _Articles_ put to bishop Gardiner in 1550 required him\r\nto declare ‘that the counterfeiting St. Nicholas, St. Clement, St.\r\nCatherine and St. Edmund, by children, heretofore brought into the\r\nchurch, was a mockery and foolishness’ (Froude, iv. 550).\r\n\r\n[1321] _Machyn’s Diary_, 75 ‘The xij day of November [1554] was\r\ncommondyd by the bysshope of London to all clarkes in the dyoses of\r\nLondon for to have Sant Necolas and to go a-brod, as mony as wold have\r\nytt ... [the v day of December, the which was Saint Nicholas’ eve,\r\nat even-song time, came a commandment that St. Nicholas should not\r\ngo abroad, nor about. But, notwithstanding, there went about these\r\nSaint Nicholases in divers parishes, as St. Andrew’s, Holborn, and\r\nSt.] Nicolas Olyffe in Bredstret.’ Warton, iv. 237, says that during\r\nMary’s reign Hugh Rhodes, a gentleman or musician of the Chapel royal,\r\nprinted in black letter quarto a poem of thirty-six octave stanzas,\r\nentitled _The Song of the Chyldbysshop, as it was songe before the\r\nqueenes maiestie in her privie chamber at her manour of saynt James in\r\nthe Feeldes on Saynt Nicholas day and Innocents day this yeare nowe\r\npresent, by the chylde bysshope of Poules churche with his company_.’\r\nWarton apparently saw the poem, for he describes it as ‘a fulsome\r\npanegyric on the queen’s devotion, in which she is compared to Judith,\r\nEsther, the Queen of Sheba, and the Virgin Mary,’ but no copy of it is\r\nnow known; cf. F. J. Furnivall, _The Babees Book_ (E. E. T. S.), lxxxv.\r\n\r\n[1322] _Machyn’s Diary_, 121 ‘The v day of Desember [1556] was Sant\r\nNecolas evyn, and Sant Necolas whentt a-brod in most partt in London\r\nsyngyng after the old fassyon, and was reseyvyd with mony good pepulle\r\nin-to ther howses, and had myche good chere as ever they had, in mony\r\nplasses.’ Foxe, _Acts and Monuments_, viii. 726, celebrates the wit\r\nof a ‘godly matron,’ Mrs. Gertrude Crockhay, who shut ‘the foolish\r\npopish Saint Nicholas’ out of her house in this year, and told her\r\nbrother-in-law, Dr. Mallet, when he remonstrated, that she had heard\r\nof men robbed by ‘Saint Nicholas’s clerks.’ This was a slang term for\r\nthieves, of whom, as of children, St. Nicholas was the patron; for\r\nthe reason of which cf. _Golden Legend_, ii. 119. Another procession\r\nforbidden by the proclamation of 1541 was also revived in 1556; cf.\r\n_Machyn’s Diary_, 119 ‘[The xxiv day of November, being the eve of\r\nSaint Katharine, at six of the clock at night] sant Katheryn(’s) lyght\r\n[went about the battlements of Saint Paul’s with singing,] and Sant\r\nKatheryn gohying a prossessyon.’\r\n\r\n[1323] At Exton in Rutlandshire, children were allowed at the beginning\r\nof the nineteenth century to play in the church on Innocents’ Day\r\n_(Leicester and Rutland Folk-Lore_, 96). Probably a few other examples\r\ncould be collected.\r\n\r\n[1324] At Mainz, not only the _pueri_, but also the _diaconi_ and\r\nthe _sacerdotes_, had their _episcopus_ (Dürr, 71). On the other\r\nhand at Vienne the term used at all the feasts, of the _triduum_ and\r\non January 1 and 6, was _rex_ (Pilot de Thorey, _Usages, Fêtes et\r\nCoutumes en Dauphiné_, i. 179). The Boy Bishops received, for their\r\nbrief day, all the external marks of honour paid to real bishops.\r\nThey are alleged to have occasionally enjoyed more solid privileges.\r\nLouvet (_Hist. et Ant. de Beauvais_, cited Rigollot, 142), says that\r\nat Beauvais the right of presentation to chapter benefices falling\r\nvacant on Innocents’ Day fell to the _pueri_. Jean Van der Muelen or\r\nMolanus (_De Canonicis_ (1587), ii. 43) makes a similar statement\r\nas to Cambrai: ‘Immo personatus hic episcopus in quibusdam locis\r\nreditus, census et capones, annue percipit: alibi mitram habet, multis\r\nepiscoporum mitris sumptuosiorem. In Cameracensi ecclesia visus est\r\nvacantem, in mense episcopi, praebendam, quasi iure ad se devoluto,\r\nconferre; quam collationem beneficii vere magnifici, reverendissimus\r\npraesul, cum puer grato animo, magistrum suum, bene de ecclesia\r\nmeritum, nominasset, gratam et raram habuit.’ At Mainz lost tradition\r\nhad it that if an Elector died during the tenure of office by a Boy\r\nBishop, the revenues _sede vacante_ would fall to him. Unfortunately\r\nthe chapter and verse of history disprove this (Dürr, 67, 79). On the\r\nother hand it is certain that the Boy Bishops assumed the episcopal\r\nprivilege of coinage. Rigollot, 52 sqq., describes and figures a long\r\nseries of fifteenth-and sixteenth-century coins or medals mostly struck\r\nby ‘bishops’ of the various churches and monastic houses of Amiens.\r\nThey are the more interesting, because some of them bear ‘fools’ as\r\ndevices, and thus afford another proof of the relations between the\r\nfeasts of Boys and Fools. Lille _monetae_ of the sixteenth century are\r\nfigured by Vanhende, _Numismatique Lilloise_, 256, and others from\r\nLaon by C. Hidé, in _Bull. de la Soc. acad. de Laon_, xiii. 126. Some\r\nof Rigollot’s specimens seem to have belonged, not to Boy Bishops, but\r\nto _confréries_, who struck them as ‘jetons de présence’ (Chartier,\r\n_L’ancien Chapitre de N.-D. de Paris_, 178); and probably this is also\r\nthe origin of the pieces found at Bury St. Edmunds, which have nothing\r\nin their devices to connect them with a Boy Bishop (Rimbault, xxvi).\r\n\r\n[1325] Ivo Carnotensis, _Epist._ 67, _ad papam Urbanum_ (_P. L._ clxii.\r\n87)\r\n\r\n    ‘eligimus puerum, puerorum festa colentes,\r\n     non nostrum morem, sed regis iussa sequentes.’\r\n\r\nCf. Rigollot, 143.\r\n\r\n[1326] Lucas Cusentinus (†1203-24) _Ordinarium_ (Martene, iii. 39):\r\n‘Puero episcopello pontificalia conceduntur insignia, et ipse dicit\r\norationes.’\r\n\r\n[1327] _The Ritual_ (†1264) of St. Omer (_Mém. de la Soc. des Antiq. de\r\nla Morinie_, xx. 186) has the following rubric for St. Nicholas’ Day\r\n‘in secundis vesperis ... a choristis incipitur prosa _Sospitati dedit\r\negros_, in qua altercando cantatur iste versus _Ergo laudes_ novies\r\ntantum, ne immoderatum tedium generet vel derisum.’ The same rubric\r\nrecurs on St. Catherine’s Day. At St. Omer, as at Paris (cf. p. 363),\r\nthese were the two winter holidays for scholars. Cf. also p. 289, and\r\nA. Legrand, _Réjouissances des écoliers de N.-D. de St. Omer, le jour\r\nde St.-Nicholas, leur glorieux patron_ (_Mémoires_, _ut cit._ vii.\r\n160). The St. Omer _Episcopus puerorum_ also officiated on Innocents’\r\nEve and the octave. Dreves, _Anal. Hymn._ xxi. 82, gives various\r\n_cantiones_ for St. Nicholas’ Day; e.g.\r\n\r\n    ‘Nicolai praesulis\r\n    Festum celebremus,\r\n      .  .  .  .  .\r\n    In tanto natalitio\r\n    Patrum docet traditio\r\n    Ut consonet in gaudio\r\n    Fidelium devotio,\r\n    Est ergo superstitio\r\n    Vacare a tripudio.’\r\n\r\nIn England it is probable that the Beverley Boy Bishop also officiated\r\non St. Nicholas’ Day. A chapter order of Jan. 7, 1313, directs the\r\ntransfer of the ‘servitium sancti Nicholai in festo eiusdem per\r\nMagistrum Scholarum Beverlacensium celebrandum’ to the altar of St.\r\nBlaize during the building of a new nave (A. F. Leach, _Memorials of\r\nBeverley Minster_, Surtees Soc. i. 307).\r\n\r\n[1328] Tille, _D. W._ 32; Leach, 130. The connexion of St. Nicholas\r\nwith children may be explained by, if it did not rather give rise\r\nto, either the legend of his early piety, ‘The first day that he was\r\nwashed and bained, he addressed him right up in the bason, and he wold\r\nnot take the breast nor the pap but once on the Wednesday and once\r\non the Friday, and in his young age he eschewed the plays and japes\r\nof other young children’ (_Golden Legend_, ii. 110); or the various\r\nother legends which represent him as bringing children out of peril.\r\nCf. _Golden Legend_, ii. 119 sqq., and especially the history of the\r\nresurrection of three boys from a pickle-tub narrated by Mr. Leach\r\nfrom Wace. A. Maury, (_Croyances et Légendes du Moyen Âge_ (ed. 1896),\r\n149) tries to find the origin of this in misunderstood iconographic\r\nrepresentations of the missionary saint at the baptismal font.\r\n\r\n[1329] Leach, 130; _Golden Legend_, ii. 111.\r\n\r\n[1330] Cf. ch. xi. The position of St. Nicholas’ Day in the ceremonies\r\ndiscussed in this chapter is sometimes shared by other feasts of the\r\nwinter cycle: St. Edmund’s (Nov. 20), St. Clement’s (Nov. 23), St.\r\nCatherine’s (Nov. 25), St. Andrew’s (Nov. 30), St. Eloi’s (Dec. 1),\r\nSt. Lucy’s (Dec. 13). Cf. pp. 349-51, 359, 366-8. The feast of St.\r\nMary Magdalen, kept in a Norman convent (p. 362), was, however, in the\r\nsummer (July 22).\r\n\r\n[1331] Specht, 229; Tille, _D. W._ 300; Wetze and Welte, iv. 1411.\r\nRoman schoolmasters expected a present at the _Minervalia_ (March\r\n18-23); cf. the passage from Tertullian in Appendix N (1).\r\n\r\n[1332] Martin Franc, _Champion des dames_ (_Bibl. de l’École des\r\nChartes_, v. 58).\r\n\r\n[1333] Du Tilliot, 87.\r\n\r\n[1334] Julleville, _Les Com._ 241.\r\n\r\n[1335] Julleville, _Les Com._ 193, 256; Du Tilliot, 97. The\r\nchief officers of the chapel _fous_ were the ‘bâtonnier’ and the\r\n‘protonotaire et procureur des fous.’ In the _Infanterie_ these are\r\nreplaced by the emblematical _Mère Folle_ and the ‘Procureur fiscal’\r\nknown as ‘Fiscal vert’ or ‘Griffon vert.’ Du Tilliot and others have\r\ncollected a number of documents concerning the _Infanterie_, together\r\nwith representations of seals, badges, &c., used by them. These may be\r\ncompared in Du Tilliot with the _bâton_ belonging to the Chapel period\r\n(1482), which he also gives. The motto of the _Infanterie_ is worth\r\nnoticing. It was _Numerus stultorum infinitus est_, and was taken from\r\n_Ecclesiastes_, i. 15. It was used also at Amiens (Julleville, _Les\r\nCom._ 234).\r\n\r\n[1336] At Amiens the ‘feste du Prince des Sots’ existed in 1450\r\n(Julleville, _Les Com._ 233), but the ‘Pope of Fools’ was not finally\r\nsuppressed in the cathedral for another century. But at Amiens there\r\nwas an immense multiplication of ‘fool’-organizations. Each church and\r\nconvent had its ‘episcopus puerorum,’ and several of these show _fous_\r\non their coins. Rigollot, 77, 105, figures a coin with _fous_, which he\r\nassigns to a _confrérie_ in the parish of St. Remigius; also a coin,\r\ndated 1543, of an ‘Evesque des Griffons.’\r\n\r\n[1337] Julleville, _Les Com._ 144.\r\n\r\n[1338] The term _cornard_ seems to be derived from the ‘cornes’ of the\r\ntraditional fool headdress. Leber, ix. 353, reprints from the _Mercure\r\nde France_ for April, 1725, an account of a procession made by the\r\n_abbas cornardorum_ at Evreux mounted upon an ass, which directly\r\nrecalls the Feast of Fools. A macaronic _chanson_ used on the occasion\r\nof one of these processions is preserved:\r\n\r\n    ‘_De asino bono nostro,_\r\n     _Meliori et optimo,_\r\n     _Debemus_ faire fête.\r\n     En revenant de Gravignariâ,\r\n     Un gros chardon _reperit in viâ_;\r\n     Il lui coupa la tête.\r\n     _Vir monachus, in mense Iulio,_\r\n     _Egressus est e monasterio_,\r\n     C’est dom de la Bucaille.\r\n     _Egressus est sine licentiâ_,\r\n     Pour aller voir donna Venissia,\r\n     Et faire la ripaille.’\r\n\r\nResearch has identified Dom de la Bucaille and Donna Venissia as\r\nrespectively a prior of St. Taurin, and a prioress of St. Saviour’s, in\r\nEvreux.\r\n\r\n[1339] A _coquille_ is a misprint, and this _société_ was composed of\r\nthe printers of Lyon.\r\n\r\n[1340] _Conc. of Avignon_ (1326), c. 37, _de societatibus\r\ncolligationibus et coniurationibus quas confratrias appellant radicitus\r\nextirpandis_ (Labbé, xi. 1738), forbids both clerks and laymen ‘ne\r\nse confratres priores abbatas praedictae societatis appellent.’ The\r\ncharges brought against the _confréries_ are of perverting justice, not\r\nof wanton revelry, and therefore it is probably not ‘sociétés joyeuses’\r\nthat are in question; cf. Ducange, s. v. _Abbas Confratriae_, quoting\r\na Paris example. Grenier, 362, however, mentions a ‘confrérie’ in the\r\nHôpital de Rue at Amiens (†1210) which was under an ‘évêque’; cf. the\r\nfollowing note.\r\n\r\n[1341] I find an ‘évesque des folz’ at Béthune, a ‘M. le Cardinal’\r\nas head of the ‘Joyeux’ at Rheims (Julleville, _Les Com._ 242; _Rép.\r\nCom._ 340), and an ‘évesque des Griffons’ at Amiens (Rigollot, 105).\r\nExceptional is, I believe, the _Société des Foux_ founded on the lines\r\nof a chivalric order by Adolphe, Comte de Clèves, in 1380 (Du Tilliot,\r\n84).\r\n\r\n[1342] Julleville, 236; Guy, 471.\r\n\r\n[1343] Julleville, 88, 136. The Paris _Basoche_ was a ‘royaume’; those\r\nof Chambéry and Geneva were ‘abbayes.’\r\n\r\n[1344] Cf. p. 304.\r\n\r\n[1345] Julleville, _Les Com._ 152.\r\n\r\n[1346] Bulaeus, _Hist. Univ. Paris_, v. 690; Julleville, _Les Com._\r\n297; Rashdall, _Universities of Europe_, ii. 611. It was probably to\r\nthis student custom that the Tournai rioters of 1499 appealed (cf. p.\r\n301). In 1470 the Faculty of Arts ordered the suppression of it. Cf.\r\nC. Jourdain, _Index Chartarum Paris_. 294 (No. 1369). On Jan. 5 they\r\nmet ‘ad providendum remedium de electione regis fatuorum,’ and decreed\r\n‘quod nullus scolaris assumeret habitum fatui pro illo anno, nec in\r\ncollegio, nec extra collegium, nisi forsan duntaxat ludendo farsam vel\r\nmoralitatem.’ Several scholars ‘portantes arma et assumentes habitus\r\nfatuorum’ were corrected on Jan. 24, and it was laid down that ‘reges\r\nvero fatuorum priventur penitus a gradu quocumque.’\r\n\r\n[1347] Grenier, 365; Ducange, s. v. _Deposuit_, quoting _Stat. Hosp.\r\nS. Iacobi Paris._ (sixteenth century), ‘après le diner, on porte\r\nle baton au cueur, et là est le trésorier, qui chante et fait le\r\n_Deposuit_.’ _Stat. Syn. Petri de Broc. episc. Autiss._ (1642) ‘pendant\r\nque les bâtons de confrérie seront exposez, pour être enchéris, l’on\r\nne chantera _Magnificat_, et n’appliquera-t-on point ces versets\r\n_Deposuit_ et _Suscepit_ à la délivrance d’iceux; ains on chantera\r\nquelque antienne et répons avec l’oraison propre en l’honneur du Saint,\r\nduquel on célèbre la feste.’\r\n\r\n[1348] Cf. ch. iii and Appendix F; and on the general character of\r\nthe _puys_, Julleville, _Les Com._ 42; Guy, xxxiv; Paris, 185. Some\r\ndocuments with regard to a fourteenth-century _puy_ in London are in\r\nRiley, _Liber Custumarum_, xlviii. 216, 479 (_Munim. Gildh. Lond._ in\r\nR. S.); _Memorials of London_, 42.\r\n\r\n[1349] Julleville, _Les Com._ 92, 233, 236, 241.\r\n\r\n[1350] Clément-Hémery, _Fêtes du Dép. du Nord_, 184, states on the\r\nauthority of a MS. without title or signature that this _fête_\r\noriginated in a prose with a bray in it, sung by the canons of St.\r\nPeter’s. The lay form of the feast can be traced from †1476 to 1668.\r\nLeber, x. 135, puts the (clerical) origin before 1282.\r\n\r\n[1351] Julleville, _Les Com._ 92, 204, 247.\r\n\r\n[1352] F. Guérard, _Les Fous de Saint-Germain_, in _Mélanges d’Hist. et\r\nd’Arch._ (Amiens, 1861), 17. On the Saturday before the first Sunday in\r\nMay children in the rue St. Germain carry boughs, singing\r\n\r\n    ‘Saint Germain, coucou,\r\n     Ch’est l’fette d’chés fous, &c.’\r\n\r\nIn the church they used to place a bottle crowned with yellow\r\nprimroses, called ‘coucous.’ The dwellers in the parish are locally\r\nknown as ‘fous,’ and an historical myth is told to account for this.\r\nProbably May-day has here merged with St. Germain’s Day (May 2) in a\r\n‘fête des fous.’ Payments for decking the church appear in old accounts.\r\n\r\n[1353] Guérard, _op. cit._ 46.\r\n\r\n[1354] Leber, x. 125, from _Mercure de France_ for April, 1726; Gasté,\r\n46.\r\n\r\n[1355] ‘ludunt ad quillas super voltas ecclesiae ... faciunt podia,\r\nchoreas et choros ... et reliqua sicut in natalibus.’\r\n\r\n[1356] Leber, ix. 261.\r\n\r\n[1357] Julleville, _Les Com._ 233, quotes a decree of the municipality\r\nof Amiens in 1450, ‘Il a esté dit et declairié qu’il semble que ce sera\r\ntres grande recreacion, considéré les bonnes nouvelles que de jour en\r\njour en disoit du Roy nostre sire, et que le ducée de Normendie est du\r\ntout reunye en sa main, de fere la feste du Prince des Sots.’\r\n\r\n[1358] Ibid. 214.\r\n\r\n[1359] Cf. ch. vii.\r\n\r\n[1360] Julleville, _Les Com._ 209.\r\n\r\n[1361] Leber, ix. 150, reprints the _Recueil de la Chevauchée faicte\r\nen la Ville de Lyon le dix septiesme de novembre_, 1578. Another Lyon\r\n_Recueil_ dates from 1566. Cf. Julleville, _Les Com._ 234 (Amiens), 243\r\n(Lyon), 248 (Rouen).\r\n\r\n[1362] Cf. chs. xiii, xiv. The _theatrales ludi_ of Pope Innocent III’s\r\ndecree in 1207 probably refers only to the burlesque ‘offices’ of the\r\nfeasts condemned; and even the terms used by the Theological Faculty\r\nin 1445--_spectacula_, _ludi theatrales_, _personagiorum ludi_--might\r\nmean no more, for at Troyes in the previous year the ‘_jeu du sacre de\r\nleur arcevesque_’ was called a ‘jeu de personnages,’ and this might\r\nhave been a mere burlesque consecration. However, ‘jeu de personnages’\r\ngenerally implies something distinctly dramatic (cf. ch. xxiv). It\r\nrecurs in the Sens order of 1511. The Beauvais _Daniel_ was possibly\r\nplayed at a Feast of Fools: at Tours a _Prophetae_ and a _miraculum_\r\nappear under similar conditions; at Autun a _Herod_ gave a name to the\r\n_dominus festi_. At Laon there were ‘mysteries’ in 1464 and 1465; by\r\n1531 these had given way to ‘comedies.’ Farces were played at Tournai\r\nin 1498 and comedies at Lille in 1526.\r\n\r\n[1363] Cf. ch. xv. The Toul _Statutes_ of 1497 mention the playing of\r\nmiracles, morals, and farces. At Laon the playing of a comedy had been\r\ndropped before 1546.\r\n\r\n[1364] Julleville, _Rép. Com._ 321 (_Catalogue des representations_),\r\nand elsewhere, gives many examples. The following decree (†1327)\r\nof Dominique Grima, bishop of Pamiers, is quoted by L. Delisle, in\r\n_Romania_, xxii. 274: ‘Dampnamus autem et anathematizamus ludum cenicum\r\nvocatum _Centum Drudorum_, vulgariter _Cent Drutz_, actenus observatum\r\nin nostra dyocesi, et specialiter in nostra civitate Appamiensi et\r\nvilla de Fuxo, per clericos et laycos interdum magni status; in quo\r\nludo effigiabantur prelati et religiosi graduum et ordinum diversorum,\r\nfacientes processionem cum candelis de cepo, et vexilis in quibus\r\ndepicta erant membra pudibunda hominis et mulieris. Induebant etiam\r\nconfratres illius ludi masculos iuvenes habitu muliebri et deducebant\r\neos processionaliter ad quendam quem vocabant priorem dicti ludi, cum\r\ncarminibus inhonestissima verba continentes....’ The _confrates_ and\r\nthe _prior_ here look like a _société joyeuse_, but the ‘ludus cenicus’\r\nwas probably less a regular play than a dramatized bit of folk-ritual,\r\nlike the Troyes _Sacre de l’arcevesque_ and the _Charivaris_. The\r\nchange of sex-costume is to be noted.\r\n\r\n[1365] Cf. ch. xx.\r\n\r\n[1366] Julleville, _Les Com._ 33; _La Com._ 73 ‘Le premier qui s’avisa,\r\npendant l’ivresse bruyante de la fête, de monter dans la chaire\r\nchrétienne et d’y parodier le prédicateur dans une improvisation\r\nburlesque, débita le premier sermon joyeux.

Le Seigneur Dieu\r\nveuille avoir en gré l’âme de luy qui oneques ne faillit en sa charge\r\net fonction emprès nostre royale Seigneurie et mesmement ne voult\r\nsi trespasser sans faire quelque joyeuseté et gentille farce de son\r\nmétier.’\r\n\r\n[1393] Moreau, 177, 197.\r\n\r\n[1394] Quoted by Julleville, _Les Com._ 148:\r\n\r\n    ‘L’un [le poète] a la teste verte; et l’autre va couvert\r\n     D’un joli chapperon, fait de jaune et de vert;\r\n     L’un s’amuse aux grelots, et l’autre à des sornettes.’\r\n\r\n[1395] _Requestes présentées au Roy ... par le S. de Vertau_ (1605),\r\nquoted by Leber, in Rigollot, lxvi; Julleville, _Les Com._ 147 ‘un\r\nhabit ... qui estoit faict par bandes de serge, moitié de couleur verte\r\net l’autre de jaune; et là où il y avoit des bandes jaunes, il y avoit\r\ndes passemens verts, et sur les vertes des passemens jaunes ... et un\r\nbonnet aussi moitié de jaune et vert, avec des oreilles, &c.’\r\n\r\n[1396] Kempe, _Loseley MSS_, 35, 47, 85.\r\n\r\n[1397] Douce, 512; Doran, 293.

Hence the common derived sense of ‘coxcomb’ for\r\na foolish, vain fellow.\r\n\r\n[1400] Douce, 509, quoting ‘the second tale of the priests of Peblis,’\r\nwhich, for all I know, may be a translation, ‘a man who counterfeits a\r\nfool is described “with club and bel and partie cote with eiris”; but\r\nit afterwards appears that he had both a club and a bauble.’\r\n\r\n[1401] Douce, 510.\r\n\r\n[1402] Douce, 512, quoting _Gesta Grayorum_, ‘the scribe claims the\r\nmanor of Noverinte, by providing sheepskins and calves-skins to wrappe\r\nhis highness wards and idiotts in’; cf. _King John_, iii. 1. 129 ‘And\r\nhang a calf’s-skin on those recreant limbs.’\r\n\r\n[1403] Douce, 511.\r\n\r\n[1404] _Twelfth Night_, i. 5. 63; _As You Like It_, ii. 7. 13, 43;\r\n_King Lear_, i. 4. 160; _Midsummer Night’s Dream_, iv. 1. 215.

A notion of their appearance is given by\r\nthe cuts from miniatures (†1343) in Strutt, 160.\r\n\r\n[1421] ‘Et ad faciendum ludos Regis ad festum Natalis domini anno\r\nRegis xxij^{do} celebratum apud Ottefordum ubi expendebantur viseres\r\nvidelicet xij capita hominum et desuper tot capita leonum, xij\r\ncapita hominum et tot capita elephantum, xij capita hominum cum alis\r\nvespertilionum, xij capita de wodewose [cf. p. 185], xvij capita\r\nvirginum, xiiij supertunicae de worsted rubro guttatae cum auro et\r\nlineatae et reversatae et totidem tunicae de worsted viridi....

The element of semi-dramatic\r\n_spectacle_ was already getting into the fourteenth-century tournament.\r\nIn 1331 Edward III and his court rode to the lists in Cheap, ‘omnes\r\nsplendido apparatu vestiti et ad similitudinem Tartarorum larvati’\r\n(_Annales Paulini_ in _Chron. Edw. I and II_, R. S. i. 354). In 1375\r\n‘rood dame Alice Perrers, as lady of the sune, fro the tour of London\r\nthorugh Chepe; and alwey a lady ledynge a lordys brydell. And thanne\r\nbegun the grete justes in Smythefeld’ (_London Chronicle_, 70). These\r\nridings closely resemble the ‘mummings’ proper. But they were a prelude\r\nto _hastiludia_, which from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century\r\nconstantly grew less actual and more mimetic. In 1343 ‘fuerunt pulchra\r\nhastiludia in Smethfield, ubi papa et duodecim cardinales per tres\r\ndies contra quoscumque tirocinium habuerunt’ (Murimuth, _Continuatio\r\nChronicarum_, R. S. 146). And so on, through the jousts of Pallas\r\nand Diana at the coronation of Henry VIII (Hall, 511) to the regular\r\nElizabethan ‘Barriers,’ such as the siege of the ‘Fortress of Perfect\r\nBeauty’ by the ‘Four Foster Children of Desire,’ in which Sidney took\r\npart in 1581.\r\n\r\n[1423] This seems to be clearly the sense of the _ludi Domini Prioris_\r\nin the accounts of Durham Priory (cf. Appendix E). The Scottish\r\nExchequer Rolls between 1446 and 1478 contain such entries as ‘iocis\r\net ludis,’ ‘ludis et interludiis,’ ‘ioculancium et ludencium,’ ‘ludos\r\net disportus suos,’ where all the terms used, except ‘interludiis’\r\n(cf. ch. xxiv), appear to be more or less equivalent (_Accounts of the\r\nTreasurer of Scotland_, i. ccxxxix). The _Liber Niger_ of Edward IV\r\ndeclares that in the _Domus_ of Henry I were allowed ‘ludi honesti,’\r\nsuch as military sports ‘cum ceterorum iocorum diversitate’ (_Household\r\nOrdinances_, 18). ‘Ioca’ is here exactly the French ‘jeux.’ Polydore\r\nVergil, _Hist. Anglica_ (ed. Thysius), 772, says of the weddings of\r\nthe children of Henry VII ‘utriusque puellae nuptiae omnium generum\r\nludis factae.’ For ‘disports’ cf. Hall, 774, ‘enterludes ... maskes\r\nand disportes,’ and _Paston Letters_, iii. 314, where Lady Morley is\r\nsaid to have ordered in 1476 that on account of her husband’s death\r\nthere should be at Christmas ‘non dysgysyngs, ner harpyng, ner lutyng,\r\nner syngyn, ner non lowde dysports, but pleyng at the tabyllys, and\r\nschesse, and cards. Sweche dysports sche gave her folkys leve to play,\r\nand non odyr.’ I find the first use of ‘revels’ in the Household Books\r\nof Henry VII for 1493 (Collier, i. 50). In 1496 the same source gives\r\nthe Latin ‘revelliones’ (Collier, i. 46). Sir Thomas Cawarden (1545)\r\nwas patented ‘magister iocorum, revellorum et mascorum’ (Rymer, xv.\r\n62). Another synonym is ‘triumph,’ used in 1511 (Arnold, _Chronicle_,\r\nxlv). The latter means properly a royal entry or reception; cf. ch.\r\nxxiii.\r\n\r\n[1424] Warton, ii. 220, from _Compotus Magn. Garderobae_, 14 Ric.\r\nII, f. 198^b ‘pro xxi coifs de tela linea pro hominibus de lege\r\ncontrafactis pro ludo regis tempore natalis domini anno xii.’\r\n\r\n[1425] Froissart (ed. Buchon, iii. 176), Bk. iv, ch. 32, describes the\r\ndance of 1393, in which Charles VI dressed in flax as a wild man was\r\nnearly burnt to death.\r\n\r\n[1426] The English _William of Palerne_, 1620 (†1350, ed. Skeat, E. E.\r\nT. S.), has ‘daunces disgisi.’\r\n\r\n[1427] H. T. Riley, _Liber Albus_ (R. S. xii), i. 644, 645, 647, 673,\r\n676; _Memorials of London_, 193, 534, 561. For similar orders elsewhere\r\ncf. L. T. Smith, _Ricart’s Calendar_, 85 (Bristol), and _Harl. MS._\r\n2015, f. 64 (Chester).\r\n\r\n[1428] Riley, _Memorials_, 658.\r\n\r\n[1429] Ibid. 669. It was proclaimed ‘that no manere persone, of what\r\nastate, degre, or condicioun that euere he be, duryng this holy\r\ntyme of Cristemes be so hardy in eny wyse to walk by nyght in any\r\nmanere mommyng, pleyes, enterludes, or eny other disgisynges with eny\r\nfeynyd berdis, peyntid visers, diffourmyd or colourid visages in eny\r\nwyse ... outake that hit be leful to eche persone for to be honestly\r\nmery as he can, with in his owne hous dwellyng.’\r\n\r\n[1430] Stowe, _Survey_ (ed. Thoms), 37, from a fragment of an English\r\nchronicle, in a sixteenth-century hand, in _Harl. MS._ 247, f. 172^v\r\n(cf. _Archaeologia_, xxii. 208). I print the original text, which\r\nStowe paraphrases, introducing, e.g., the term ‘maskers’: ‘At y^e same\r\ntyme y^e Comons of London made great sporte and solemnity to y^e yong\r\nprince: for upon y^e monday next before y^e purification of our lady\r\nat night and in y^e night were 130 men disguizedly aparailed and well\r\nmounted on horsebacke to goe on mumming to y^e said prince, riding from\r\nNewgate through Cheape whear many people saw them with great noyse of\r\nminstralsye, trumpets, cornets and shawmes and great plenty of waxe\r\ntorches lighted and in the beginning they rid 48 after y^e maner of\r\nesquiers two and two together clothed in cotes and clokes of red say\r\nor sendall and their faces covered with vizards well and handsomely\r\nmade: after these esquiers came 48 like knightes well arayed after y^e\r\nsame maner: after y^e knightes came one excellent arrayed and well\r\nmounted as he had bene an emperor: after him some 100 yards came one\r\nnobly arayed as a pope and after him came 24 arayed like cardinals and\r\nafter y^e cardinals came 8 or 10 arayed and with black vizardes like\r\ndeuils appearing nothing amiable seeming like legates, riding through\r\nLondon and ouer London bridge towards Kenyton wher y^e yong prince\r\nmade his aboad with his mother and the D. of Lancaster and y^e Earles\r\nof Cambridge, Hertford Warrick and Suffolk and many other lordes which\r\nwere with him to hould the solemnity, and when they were come before\r\ny^e mansion they alighted on foot and entered into y^e haule and sone\r\nafter y^e prince and his mother and y^e other lordes came out of y^e\r\nchamber into y^e haule, and y^e said mummers saluted them, shewing a\r\npair of dice upon a table to play with y^e prince, which dice were\r\nsubtilly made that when y^e prince shold cast he shold winne and y^e\r\nsaid players and mummers set before y^e prince three jewels each after\r\nother: and first a balle of gould, then a cupp of gould, then a gould\r\nring, y^e which y^e said prince wonne at thre castes as before it was\r\nappointed, and after that they set before the prince’s mother, the D.\r\nof Lancaster, and y^e other earles euery one a gould ringe and y^e\r\nmother and y^e lordes wonne them. And then y^e prince caused to bring\r\ny^e wyne and they dronk with great joye, commanding y^e minstrels to\r\nplay and y^e trompets began to sound and other instruments to pipe &c.\r\nAnd y^e prince and y^e lordes dansed on y^e one syde, and y^e mummers\r\non y^e other a great while and then they drank and tooke their leaue\r\nand so departed toward London.’ Collier, i. 26, speaks of earlier\r\nmummings recorded by Stowe in 1236 and 1298; but Stowe only names\r\n‘pageants’ (cf. ch. xxiii). M. Paris, _Chronica Maiora_ (R. S. lvii),\r\nv. 269, mentions ‘vestium transformatarum varietatem’ at the wedding\r\nof Alexander III of Scotland and Margaret of England in 1251, but this\r\nprobably means ‘a succession of rapidly changed robes.’\r\n\r\n[1431] _A Chronicle of London_ (†1442, ed. N. H. Nicolas or E. Tyrrell,\r\n1827), 85 ‘to have sclayn the kyng ... be a mommynge’; _Incerti\r\nScriptoris Chronicon_ (before 1455, ed. J. A. Giles), 7 ‘conduxerunt\r\nlusores Londoniam, ad inducendum regi praetextum gaudii et laetitiae\r\niuxta temporis dispositionem, ludum nuncupatum Anglice Mummynge’;\r\nCapgrave, _Chronicle of England_ (†1464, R. S.), 275 ‘undir the coloure\r\nof mummeris in Cristmasse tyme’; _An English Chronicle_ (†1461-71,\r\nC. S.), 20 ‘to make a mommyng to the king ... and in that mommyng\r\nthey purposid to sle him’; Fabian, _Chronicle_, 567 ‘a dysguysynge or\r\na mummynge.’ But other chroniclers say that the outbreak was to be\r\nat a tournament, e.g. _Continuatio Eulogii_ (R. S. ix), iii. 385;\r\n_Annales Henrici_ (R. S. xxviii), 323 ‘Sub simulatione natalitiorum\r\nvel hastiludiorum.’ I suppose ‘natalitia’ is ‘Christmas games’ and\r\nmight cover a mumming. Hall, _Chronicle_ (ed. 1809), 16, makes it\r\n‘justes.’ So does Holinshed (ed. 1586), iii. 514, 516, but he knew both\r\nversions; ‘them that write how the king should have beene made awaie at\r\na justs; and other that testifie, how it should have been at a maske or\r\nmummerie’; cf. Wylie, _Henry the Fourth_, i. 93; Ramsay, _L. and Y._ i.\r\n20.\r\n\r\n[1432] Stowe, _Survey_ (ed. Thoms), 37, doubtless from _A Chronicle of\r\nLondon_ (†1442, _ut supra_), 87. I do not find the mumming named in\r\nother accounts of the visit.\r\n\r\n[1433] _Gregory’s Chronicle_ (before 1467, in _Hist. Collections of a\r\nCitizen of London_, C. S.), 108 ‘the whyche Lollers hadde caste to have\r\nmade a mommynge at Eltham, and undyr coloure of the mommynge to have\r\ndestryte the Kynge and Hooly Chyrche.’\r\n\r\n[1434] _Acte against disguysed persons and Wearing of Visours_ (3 Hen.\r\nVIII, c. 9). The preamble states that ‘lately wythin this realme dyvers\r\npersons have disgysed and appareld theym, and covert theyr fayces with\r\nVysours and other thynge in such manner that they sholde nott be knowen\r\nand divers of theym in a Companye togeder namyng them selfe Mummers\r\nhave commyn to the dwellyng place of divers men of honor and other\r\nsubstanciall persones; and so departed unknowen.’ Offenders are to be\r\ntreated as ‘Suspectes or Vacabundes.’\r\n\r\n[1435] The _Promptorium Parvulorum_ (†1440 C. S.), ii. 348, translates\r\n‘_Mummynge_’ by ‘_mussacio vel mussatus_’ (‘murmuring’ or ‘keeping\r\nsilence,’ conn. _mutus_), and gives a cognate word ‘Mummȳn, as\r\nthey that noȝt speke _Mutio_.’ This is of course the ordinary sense\r\nof _mum_. But Skeat (_Etym. Dict._ s.v.) derives ‘mummer’ from the\r\nDutch through Old French, and explains it by the Low German _Mumme_,\r\na ‘mask.’ He adds ‘The word is imitative, from the sound _mum_ or\r\n_mom_, used by nurses to frighten or amuse children, at the same time\r\npretending to cover their faces.’ Whether the fourteenth-century\r\nmumming was silent or not, there is no reason to suppose that the\r\nprimitive folk-procession out of which it arose was unaccompanied\r\nby dance and song; and silence is rarely, if ever (cf. p. 211) _de\r\nrigueur_ in modern ‘guisings.’\r\n\r\n[1436] They are in _Trin. Coll. Camb. MS._ R. iii. 20 (Shirley’s; cf.\r\nE. P. Hammond, _Lydgate’s Mumming at Hertford_ in _Anglia_, xxii.\r\n364), and copied by or for Stowe ‘out of þe boke of John Sherley’\r\nin _B. M. Add. MS._ 29729, f. 132 (cf. E. Sieper, _Lydgate’s Reson\r\nand Sensuallyte_, E. E. T. S. i. xvi). The Hertford verses have been\r\nprinted by Miss Hammond (_loc. cit._) and the others by Brotanek,\r\n306. I do not find any notice of disguisings when Henry VI spent the\r\nChristmas of 1433 at Lydgate’s own monastery of Bury St. Edmunds (F.

Devon,\r\n_Issues of the Exchequer_, 473, notes a payment for the king’s ‘plays\r\nand recreations’ at Christmas, 1449.\r\n\r\n[1437] ‘A lettre made in wyse of balade by daun Johan, brought by a\r\npoursuyant in wyse of Mommers desguysed to fore þe Mayre of London,\r\nEestfeld, vpon þe twelffeþe night of Cristmasse, ordeyned Ryallych by\r\nþe worthy Merciers, Citeseyns of london’ and ‘A lettre made in wyse of\r\nbalade by ledegate daun Johan, of a mommynge, whiche þe Goldesmythes of\r\nþe Cite of London mommed in Right fresshe and costele welych desguysing\r\nto þeyre Mayre Eestfeld, vpon Candelmasse day at nyght, affter souper;\r\nbrought and presented vn to þe Mayre by an heraude, cleped ffortune.’\r\nThe Mercer’s pursuivant is sent from Jupiter; the Goldsmiths’ mummers\r\nare David and the twelve tribes. The Levites were to sing. William\r\nEastfield was mayor 1429-30 and 1437-8. Brotanek, 306, argues that, as\r\na second term is not alluded to, this was probably the first. Fairholt,\r\n_Lord Mayors’ Pageants_, ii. 240, prints a similar letter of Lydgate’s\r\nsent to the Sheriffs at a May-day dinner.\r\n\r\n[1438] ‘A balade made by daun John Lidegate at Eltham in Cristmasse\r\nfor a momyng tofore þe kyng and þe Qwene.’ Bacchus, Juno and Ceres\r\nsend gifts ‘by marchandes þat here be.’ The same collections contain a\r\nbalade, ‘gyven vnto þe Kyng Henry and to his moder the quene Kateryne\r\nsittyng at þe mete vpon the yeares day in the castell of Hertford.’\r\nSome historical allusions make 1427 a likely date (Brotanek, 305).\r\n\r\n[1439] ‘Þe devyse of a momyng to fore þe kyng henry þe sixte, beinge\r\nin his Castell of wyndesore, þe fest of his crystmasse holdyng þer,\r\nmade by lidegate daun John, þe munk of Bury, howe þampull and þe floure\r\ndelys came first to þe Kynges of ffraunce by myrakle at Reynes.’ An\r\nallusion to Henry’s coming coronation in Paris fixes the date to\r\n1429-30.\r\n\r\n[1440] ‘Þe deuyse of a desguysing to fore þe gret estates of þis lande,\r\nþane being at London, made by Lidegate daun Johan, þe Munk of Bury, of\r\ndame fortune, dame prudence, dame Rightwysnesse and dame ffortitudo.\r\nbeholdeþe, for it is moral, plesaunt and notable.’ A fifth dame is\r\n‘Attemperaunce.’ The time is ‘Cristmasse.’ An elaborate pageant in\r\nwhich Fortune dwelt is described. A song is directed at the close.\r\nHenry V is spoken of as dead.\r\n\r\n[1441] ‘Nowe foloweth here the maner of a bille by weye of supplycation\r\nput to the kynge holdinge his noble fest of crystmasse in the\r\ncastell of hartford as in dysguysinge of þe rude vpplandishe people\r\ncomplayninge on their wyues with the boystrus answere of ther wyues\r\ndeuysed by lidgate at þe requeste of the countrowlore Brys slain at\r\nlouiers.’ Louviers was taken by the French in 1430 and besieged next\r\nyear (Brotanek, 306).

Away from court\r\nin 1543 four players were committed to the Counter for ‘unlawful\r\ndisguising’ (_P. C. Acts_, i. 109, 110, 122). They surely played\r\ninterludes. It may be further noted (i) the elaborate disguisings of\r\nHenry VII and Henry VIII, with much action and speechifying besides\r\nthe dancing, are difficult to distinguish when merely described from\r\ninterludes. What Hall, 518, calls in 1511 an interlude, seems from the\r\nRevels Accounts (Brewer, ii. 1495) to have been really a disguising.\r\nHall, 641, speaks of a ‘disguisyng or play’ in 1522, and Cavendish,\r\n_Life of Wolsey_, i. 136, of a ‘disguising or interlude’ in 1527; (ii)\r\na disguising or dance might be introduced, as _entr’acte_ or otherwise,\r\ninto an interlude. In 1514 an interlude ‘conteyned a moresk of vj\r\npersons and ij ladys’ (Collier, i. 68). In 1526 a moral play was ‘set\r\nforth with straunge deuises of Maskes and Morrishes’ (Hall, 719). The\r\ninterlude of _The Nature of the Four Elements_ (early Hen. VIII) has\r\nafter the _dramatis personae_ the direction, ‘Also yf ye lyst ye may\r\nbrynge in a dysgysynge’; cf. Soergel, 21.\r\n\r\n[1455] Hall, 526.\r\n\r\n[1456] Evans, xxi. Other not very plausible suggestions are made by\r\nWard, i. 150; Soergel, 13. There is a good account of the Italian\r\n_mascherata_ from about 1474 in Symonds, _Shakespeare’s Predecessors_,\r\n321.\r\n\r\n[1457] Brewer, ii. 1497. There is a further entry in an account of 1519\r\n(Brewer, iii. 35) of a revel, called a ‘masklyne,’ after the manner of\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\n[1458] ‘Maske’ first appears in 1514 (Collier, i. 79 ‘iocorum\r\nlarvatorum, vocat. Maskes, Revelles, and Disguysings’); ‘masque’\r\nis not English until the seventeenth century (Evans, xiii). Skeat\r\nderives through the French _masque_, _masquer_, _masquerer_, and the\r\nSpanish _mascara_, _mascarada_ (Ital. _mascherata_) from the Arabic\r\n_maskharat_, a buffoon or droll (root _sakhira_, ‘he ridiculed’). The\r\noriginal sense would thus be ‘entertainment’ and that of ‘face-mask’\r\n(_larva_, ‘vizard,’ ‘viser’) only derivative. But late Latin has\r\nalready _masca_, _talamasca_ in this sense; e.g. Burchardus of Worms,\r\n_Coll. Decretorum_ (before 1024), bk. ii. c. 161 ‘nec larvas daemonum\r\nquas vulgo Talamascas dicunt, ibi ante se ferri consentiat’; cf.\r\nDucange, s.v. _Talamasca_; Pfannenschmidt, 617, with some incorrect\r\netymology. And the French _masque_ is always the face-mask and never\r\nthe performance; while _se masquier_, _masquillier_, _maschurer_,\r\nare twelfth-to thirteenth-century words for ‘blacken,’ ‘dirty.’ I\r\ntherefore prefer the derivation of Brotanek, 120, from a Germanic\r\nroot represented by the M. E. _maskel_ ‘stain’; and this has the\r\nfurther advantage of explaining ‘maskeler,’ ‘maskeling,’ which appear,\r\nvariously spelt, in documents of †1519-26. Both terms signify the\r\nperformance, and ‘maskeler’ the performer also (Brotanek, 122).\r\nFace-masks were _de rigueur_ in the Mask to a late date. In 1618\r\nJohn Chamberlain writes ‘the gentlemen of Gray’s Inn came to court\r\nwith their show, for I cannot call it a masque, seeing they were not\r\ndisguised, nor had vizards’ (Nichols, _James I_, iii. 468).\r\n\r\n[1459] Ben Jonson, iii. 162. _Masque of Augurs_ (1623) ‘Disguise was\r\nthe old English word for a masque, sir, before you were an implement\r\nbelonging to the Revels’; ii. 476, _A Tale of a Tub_ (1634), v. 2:\r\n\r\n    ‘_Pan._ A masque! what’s that?\r\n\r\n     _Scriben._ A mumming or a shew,\r\n     With vizards and fine clothes.\r\n\r\n     _Clench._ A disguise, neighbour,\r\n     Is the true word.’\r\n\r\n[1460] Cf. ch. x. Less dramatic performances are described for the\r\n‘guizards’ of the Scottish Lowlands by R. Chambers, _Popular Rhymes of\r\nScotland_, 169, for the ‘mummers’ of Ireland in _N. and Q._ 3rd series,\r\nviii. 495, for the ‘mummers’ of Yorkshire in _F. L._ iv. 162. The\r\nlatter sweep the hearth, humming ‘mumm-m-m.’\r\n\r\n[1461] _L. H. T. Accounts_, i. ccxl, 270, 327; ii. cx, 111, 320, 374,\r\n430, 431; iii. 127. In 1504 is a payment ‘to the barbour helit Paules\r\nhed quhen he wes hurt with the Abbot of Unresoun.’ Besides the court\r\nAbbot, there was an ‘Abbot of Unresone of Linlithgow’ in 1501, who\r\n‘dansit to the king,’ and an ‘Abbot of Unresoun of the pynouris of\r\nLeith’ in 1504. Such entries cease after the Scottish Act of Parliament\r\nof 1555 (cf. p. 181).\r\n\r\n[1462] Stowe, _Survey_, 37 ‘There was in the feast of Christmas in\r\nthe King’s house, wheresoever he was lodged, a Lord of Misrule or\r\nMaster of Merry Disports; and the like had ye in the house of every\r\nnobleman of honour or good worship, were he spiritual or temporal.\r\nAmong the which, the Mayor of London and either of the Sheriffs had\r\ntheir several Lords of Misrule, ever contending, without quarrel or\r\noffence, who should make the rarest pastimes to delight the beholders.\r\nThese Lords beginning their rule on Allhollons eve, continued the\r\nsame til the morrow after the feast of the Purification, commonly\r\ncalled Candlemas-day. In all which space there were fine and subtle\r\ndisguisings, masks and mummeries’; Holinshed (ed. 1587), iii. 1067\r\n‘What time [at Christmas], of old ordinarie course, there is alwaies\r\none appointed to make sport in the court, called commonlie lord of\r\nmisrule: whose office is not unknowne to such as haue beene brought up\r\nin noble mens houses, & among great house keepers which use liberall\r\nfeasting in that season.’ The sense of ‘misrule’ in this phrase is\r\n‘disorder’; cf. the ‘uncivil rule’ of _Twelfth Night_, ii. 3. 132.\r\n\r\n[1463] Collier, i. 48-55; Bentley, _Excerpt.

In\r\nthis year the terms ‘Lordship’ and ‘Abbot’ are both used.

The term ‘Master of the\r\nRevels’ is in none of these cases used. But in an ‘Order for sitting\r\nin the King’s great Chamber,’ dated Dec. 31, 1494 (_Ordinances and\r\nRegulations_, Soc.

The said letters being put into the hands of the\r\nBachelaur Fellows, they brought them into the Hall that night, and\r\nstanding, sometimes walking, round the fire, there reading the contents\r\nof them, would choose the senior Fellow that had not yet borne that\r\noffice, whether he was a Doctor of Divinity, Law, or Physic, and being\r\nso elected, had power put into his hands of punishing all misdemeanours\r\ndone in the time of Christmas, either by imposing exercises on the\r\njuniors, or putting into the stocks at the end of the Hall any of the\r\nservants, with other punishments that were sometimes very ridiculous.\r\nHe had always a chair provided for him, and would sit in great state\r\nwhen any speeches were spoken, or justice to be executed, and so this\r\nhis authority would continue till Candlemas, or much about the time\r\nthat the Ignis Regentium was celebrated in that college’; _Life and\r\nTimes_ (O.

Andrewes and his company resorting to the\r\nColledge.’ These were perhaps from the city; cf. p. 419.\r\n\r\n[1497] Dee, _Compendious Rehearsal_ (_Chronicle of John of\r\nGlastonbury_, ed. T. Hearne, 502), ‘in that College also (by my advice\r\nand by my endeavors, divers ways used with all the other colleges) was\r\ntheir Christmas Magistrate first named and confirmed an Emperor. The\r\nfirst was one Mr. Thomas Dun, a very goodly man of person, stature\r\nand complexion, and well learned also.’ Warton, iii. 302, describes\r\na draught of the college statutes in _Rawl. MS. 233_, in which cap.\r\nxxiv is headed ‘de Praefecto Ludorum qui Imperator dicitur,’ and\r\nprovides for the superintendence by the Imperator of the _Spectacula_\r\nat Christmas and Candlemas. But the references to the Imperator have\r\nbeen struck out with a pen, and the title altered to ‘de Comoediis\r\nLudisque in natali Christi exhibendis.’ This is the title of cap. xxiv\r\nas actually issued in 1560 (Mullinger, _University of Cambridge_, 579).\r\nThe earlier statutes of 1552 have no such chapter.\r\n\r\n[1498] H. King, _Funeral Sermon of Bishop Duppa_ (1662), 34 ‘Here he\r\nhad the greatest dignity which the School could afford put upon him,\r\nto be the Paedonomus at Christmas, Lord of his fellow scholars: which\r\ntitle was a pledge and presage that, from a Lord in jeast, he should,\r\nin his riper age, become one in earnest’; cf. J. Sargeaunt, _Annals of\r\nWestminster School_, 64.\r\n\r\n[1499] _Records of Lincoln’s Inn: Black Books_, i. 1.\r\n\r\n[1500] _Paston Letters_, i. 186.

About Seaven of the\r\nClocke in the Morning the Lord of Misrule is abroad, and if he lack any\r\nOfficer or attendant, he repaireth to their Chambers, and compelleth\r\nthem to attend in person upon him after Service in the Church, to\r\nbreakfast, with Brawn, Mustard, and Malmsey. After Breakfast ended, his\r\nLordship’s power is in suspence, until his personal presence at night;\r\nand then his power is most potent.’\r\n\r\n[1506] W. Dugdale, 153; Herbert, 205, 254; F. A.
