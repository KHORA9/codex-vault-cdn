Chesterton\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrefatory Note:\r\n\r\n\r\nThis ballad needs no historical notes, for the simple reason that it\r\ndoes not profess to be historical.  All of it that is not frankly\r\nfictitious, as in any prose romance about the past, is meant to\r\nemphasize tradition rather than history. King Alfred is not a legend in\r\nthe sense that King Arthur may be a legend; that is, in the sense that\r\nhe may possibly be a lie. But King Alfred is a legend in this broader\r\nand more human sense, that the legends are the most important things\r\nabout him.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cult of Alfred was a popular cult, from the darkness of the ninth\r\ncentury to the deepening twilight of the twentieth. It is wholly as a\r\npopular legend that I deal with him here. I write as one ignorant of\r\neverything, except that I have found the legend of a King of Wessex\r\nstill alive in the land.  I will give three curt cases of what I mean.\r\nA tradition connects the ultimate victory of Alfred with the valley in\r\nBerkshire called the Vale of the White Horse. I have seen doubts of the\r\ntradition, which may be valid doubts. I do not know when or where the\r\nstory started; it is enough that it started somewhere and ended with me;\r\nfor I only seek to write upon a hearsay, as the old balladists did.  For\r\nthe second case, there is a popular tale that Alfred played the harp and\r\nsang in the Danish camp; I select it because it is a popular tale, at\r\nwhatever time it arose. For the third case, there is a popular tale that\r\nAlfred came in contact with a woman and cakes; I select it because it is\r\na popular tale, because it is a vulgar one.  It has been disputed by\r\ngrave historians, who were, I think, a little too grave to be good\r\njudges of it. The two chief charges against the story are that it was\r\nfirst recorded long after Alfred's death, and that (as Mr. Oman urges)\r\nAlfred never really wandered all alone without any thanes or soldiers.\r\nBoth these objections might possibly be met. It has taken us nearly as\r\nlong to learn the whole truth about Byron, and perhaps longer to learn\r\nthe whole truth about Pepys, than elapsed between Alfred and the first\r\nwriting of such tales. And as for the other objection, do the historians\r\nreally think that Alfred after Wilton, or Napoleon after Leipsic, never\r\nwalked about in a wood by himself for the matter of an hour or two? Ten\r\nminutes might be made sufficient for the essence of the story. But I am\r\nnot concerned to prove the truth of these popular traditions. It is\r\nenough for me to maintain two things:  that they are popular traditions;\r\nand that without these popular traditions we should have bothered about\r\nAlfred about as much as we bother about Eadwig.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne other consideration needs a note.  Alfred has come down to us in the\r\nbest way (that is, by national legends) solely for the same reason as\r\nArthur and Roland and the other giants of that darkness, because he\r\nfought for the Christian civilization against the heathen nihilism. But\r\nsince this work was really done by generation after generation, by the\r\nRomans before they withdrew, and by the Britons while they remained, I\r\nhave summarised this first crusade in a triple symbol, and given to a\r\nfictitious Roman, Celt, and Saxon, a part in the glory of Ethandune. I\r\nfancy that in fact Alfred's Wessex was of very mixed bloods; but in any\r\ncase, it is the chief value of legend to mix up the centuries while\r\npreserving the sentiment; to see all ages in a sort of splendid\r\nforeshortening.  That is the use of tradition: it telescopes history.\r\n\r\n\r\nG.K.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEDICATION\r\n\r\n\r\n          Of great limbs gone to chaos,\r\n          A great face turned to night--\r\n          Why bend above a shapeless shroud\r\n          Seeking in such archaic cloud\r\n          Sight of strong lords and light?\r\n\r\n          Where seven sunken Englands\r\n          Lie buried one by one,\r\n          Why should one idle spade, I wonder,\r\n          Shake up the dust of thanes like thunder\r\n          To smoke and choke the sun?\r\n\r\n          In cloud of clay so cast to heaven\r\n          What shape shall man discern?\r\n          These lords may light the mystery\r\n          Of mastery or victory,\r\n          And these ride high in history,\r\n          But these shall not return.\r\n\r\n          Gored on the Norman gonfalon\r\n          The Golden Dragon died:\r\n          We shall not wake with ballad strings\r\n          The good time of the smaller things,\r\n          We shall not see the holy kings\r\n          Ride down by Severn side.\r\n\r\n          Stiff, strange, and quaintly coloured\r\n          As the broidery of Bayeux\r\n          The England of that dawn remains,\r\n          And this of Alfred and the Danes\r\n          Seems like the tales a whole tribe feigns\r\n          Too English to be true.\r\n\r\n          Of a good king on an island\r\n          That ruled once on a time;\r\n          And as he walked by an apple tree\r\n          There came green devils out of the sea\r\n          With sea-plants trailing heavily\r\n          And tracks of opal slime.\r\n\r\n          Yet Alfred is no fairy tale;\r\n          His days as our days ran,\r\n          He also looked forth for an hour\r\n          On peopled plains and skies that lower,\r\n          From those few windows in the tower\r\n          That is the head of a man.\r\n\r\n          But who shall look from Alfred's hood\r\n          Or breathe his breath alive?\r\n          His century like a small dark cloud\r\n          Drifts far; it is an eyeless crowd,\r\n          Where the tortured trumpets scream aloud\r\n          And the dense arrows drive.\r\n\r\n          Lady, by one light only\r\n          We look from Alfred's eyes,\r\n          We know he saw athwart the wreck\r\n          The sign that hangs about your neck,\r\n          Where One more than Melchizedek\r\n          Is dead and never dies.\r\n\r\n          Therefore I bring these rhymes to you\r\n          Who brought the cross to me,\r\n          Since on you flaming without flaw\r\n          I saw the sign that Guthrum saw\r\n          When he let break his ships of awe,\r\n          And laid peace on the sea.\r\n\r\n          Do you remember when we went\r\n          Under a dragon moon,\r\n          And 'mid volcanic tints of night\r\n          Walked where they fought the unknown fight\r\n          And saw black trees on the battle-height,\r\n          Black thorn on Ethandune?\r\n\r\n          And I thought, \"I will go with you,\r\n          As man with God has gone,\r\n          And wander with a wandering star,\r\n          The wandering heart of things that are,\r\n          The fiery cross of love and war\r\n          That like yourself, goes on.\"\r\n\r\n          O go you onward; where you are\r\n          Shall honour and laughter be,\r\n          Past purpled forest and pearled foam,\r\n          God's winged pavilion free to roam,\r\n          Your face, that is a wandering home,\r\n          A flying home for me.\r\n\r\n          Ride through the silent earthquake lands,\r\n          Wide as a waste is wide,\r\n          Across these days like deserts, when\r\n          Pride and a little scratching pen\r\n          Have dried and split the hearts of men,\r\n          Heart of the heroes, ride.\r\n\r\n          Up through an empty house of stars,\r\n          Being what heart you are,\r\n          Up the inhuman steeps of space\r\n          As on a staircase go in grace,\r\n          Carrying the firelight on your face\r\n          Beyond the loneliest star.\r\n\r\n          Take these; in memory of the hour\r\n          We strayed a space from home\r\n          And saw the smoke-hued hamlets, quaint\r\n          With Westland king and Westland saint,\r\n          And watched the western glory faint\r\n          Along the road to Frome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I. THE VISION OF THE KING\r\n\r\n\r\n          Before the gods that made the gods\r\n          Had seen their sunrise pass,\r\n          The White Horse of the White Horse Vale\r\n          Was cut out of the grass.\r\n\r\n          Before the gods that made the gods\r\n          Had drunk at dawn their fill,\r\n          The White Horse of the White Horse Vale\r\n          Was hoary on the hill.\r\n\r\n          Age beyond age on British land,\r\n          Aeons on aeons gone,\r\n          Was peace and war in western hills,\r\n          And the White Horse looked on.\r\n\r\n          For the White Horse knew England\r\n          When there was none to know;\r\n          He saw the first oar break or bend,\r\n          He saw heaven fall and the world end,\r\n          O God, how long ago.\r\n\r\n          For the end of the world was long ago,\r\n          And all we dwell to-day\r\n          As children of some second birth,\r\n          Like a strange people left on earth\r\n          After a judgment day.\r\n\r\n          For the end of the world was long ago,\r\n          When the ends of the world waxed free,\r\n          When Rome was sunk in a waste of slaves,\r\n          And the sun drowned in the sea.\r\n\r\n          When Caesar's sun fell out of the sky\r\n          And whoso hearkened right\r\n          Could only hear the plunging\r\n          Of the nations in the night.\r\n\r\n          When the ends of the earth came marching in\r\n          To torch and cresset gleam.\r\n          And the roads of the world that lead to Rome\r\n          Were filled with faces that moved like foam,\r\n          Like faces in a dream.\r\n\r\n          And men rode out of the eastern lands,\r\n          Broad river and burning plain;\r\n          Trees that are Titan flowers to see,\r\n          And tiger skies, striped horribly,\r\n          With tints of tropic rain.\r\n\r\n          Where Ind's enamelled peaks arise\r\n          Around that inmost one,\r\n          Where ancient eagles on its brink,\r\n          Vast as archangels, gather and drink\r\n          The sacrament of the sun.\r\n\r\n          And men brake out of the northern lands,\r\n          Enormous lands alone,\r\n          Where a spell is laid upon life and lust\r\n          And the rain is changed to a silver dust\r\n          And the sea to a great green stone.\r\n\r\n          And a Shape that moveth murkily\r\n          In mirrors of ice and night,\r\n          Hath blanched with fear all beasts and birds,\r\n          As death and a shock of evil words\r\n          Blast a man's hair with white.\r\n\r\n          And the cry of the palms and the purple moons,\r\n          Or the cry of the frost and foam,\r\n          Swept ever around an inmost place,\r\n          And the din of distant race on race\r\n          Cried and replied round Rome.\r\n\r\n          And there was death on the Emperor\r\n          And night upon the Pope:\r\n          And Alfred, hiding in deep grass,\r\n          Hardened his heart with hope.\r\n\r\n          A sea-folk blinder than the sea\r\n          Broke all about his land,\r\n          But Alfred up against them bare\r\n          And gripped the ground and grasped the air,\r\n          Staggered, and strove to stand.\r\n\r\n          He bent them back with spear and spade,\r\n          With desperate dyke and wall,\r\n          With foemen leaning on his shield\r\n          And roaring on him when he reeled;\r\n          And no help came at all.\r\n\r\n          He broke them with a broken sword\r\n          A little towards the sea,\r\n          And for one hour of panting peace,\r\n          Ringed with a roar that would not cease,\r\n          With golden crown and girded fleece\r\n          Made laws under a tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n          The Northmen came about our land\r\n          A Christless chivalry:\r\n          Who knew not of the arch or pen,\r\n          Great, beautiful half-witted men\r\n          From the sunrise and the sea.\r\n\r\n          Misshapen ships stood on the deep\r\n          Full of strange gold and fire,\r\n          And hairy men, as huge as sin\r\n          With horned heads, came wading in\r\n          Through the long, low sea-mire.\r\n\r\n          Our towns were shaken of tall kings\r\n          With scarlet beards like blood:\r\n          The world turned empty where they trod,\r\n          They took the kindly cross of God\r\n          And cut it up for wood.\r\n\r\n          Their souls were drifting as the sea,\r\n          And all good towns and lands\r\n          They only saw with heavy eyes,\r\n          And broke with heavy hands,\r\n\r\n          Their gods were sadder than the sea,\r\n          Gods of a wandering will,\r\n          Who cried for blood like beasts at night,\r\n          Sadly, from hill to hill.\r\n\r\n          They seemed as trees walking the earth,\r\n          As witless and as tall,\r\n          Yet they took hold upon the heavens\r\n          And no help came at all.\r\n\r\n          They bred like birds in English woods,\r\n          They rooted like the rose,\r\n          When Alfred came to Athelney\r\n          To hide him from their bows\r\n\r\n          There was not English armour left,\r\n          Nor any English thing,\r\n          When Alfred came to Athelney\r\n          To be an English king.\r\n\r\n          For earthquake swallowing earthquake\r\n          Uprent the Wessex tree;\r\n          The whirlpool of the pagan sway\r\n          Had swirled his sires as sticks away\r\n          When a flood smites the sea.\r\n\r\n          And the great kings of Wessex\r\n          Wearied and sank in gore,\r\n          And even their ghosts in that great stress\r\n          Grew greyer and greyer, less and less,\r\n          With the lords that died in Lyonesse\r\n          And the king that comes no more.\r\n\r\n          And the God of the Golden Dragon\r\n          Was dumb upon his throne,\r\n          And the lord of the Golden Dragon\r\n          Ran in the woods alone.\r\n\r\n          And if ever he climbed the crest of luck\r\n          And set the flag before,\r\n          Returning as a wheel returns,\r\n          Came ruin and the rain that burns,\r\n          And all began once more.\r\n\r\n          And naught was left King Alfred\r\n          But shameful tears of rage,\r\n          In the island in the river\r\n          In the end of all his age.\r\n\r\n          In the island in the river\r\n          He was broken to his knee:\r\n          And he read, writ with an iron pen,\r\n          That God had wearied of Wessex men\r\n          And given their country, field and fen,\r\n          To the devils of the sea.\r\n\r\n          And he saw in a little picture,\r\n          Tiny and far away,\r\n          His mother sitting in Egbert's hall,\r\n          And a book she showed him, very small,\r\n          Where a sapphire Mary sat in stall\r\n          With a golden Christ at play.\r\n\r\n          It was wrought in the monk's slow manner,\r\n          From silver and sanguine shell,\r\n          Where the scenes are little and terrible,\r\n          Keyholes of heaven and hell.\r\n\r\n          In the river island of Athelney,\r\n          With the river running past,\r\n          In colours of such simple creed\r\n          All things sprang at him, sun and weed,\r\n          Till the grass grew to be grass indeed\r\n          And the tree was a tree at last.\r\n\r\n          Fearfully plain the flowers grew,\r\n          Like the child's book to read,\r\n          Or like a friend's face seen in a glass;\r\n          He looked; and there Our Lady was,\r\n          She stood and stroked the tall live grass\r\n          As a man strokes his steed.\r\n\r\n          Her face was like an open word\r\n          When brave men speak and choose,\r\n          The very colours of her coat\r\n          Were better than good news.\r\n\r\n          She spoke not, nor turned not,\r\n          Nor any sign she cast,\r\n          Only she stood up straight and free,\r\n          Between the flowers in Athelney,\r\n          And the river running past.\r\n\r\n          One dim ancestral jewel hung\r\n          On his ruined armour grey,\r\n          He rent and cast it at her feet:\r\n          Where, after centuries, with slow feet,\r\n          Men came from hall and school and street\r\n          And found it where it lay.\r\n\r\n          \"Mother of God,\" the wanderer said,\r\n          \"I am but a common king,\r\n          Nor will I ask what saints may ask,\r\n          To see a secret thing.\r\n\r\n          \"The gates of heaven are fearful gates\r\n          Worse than the gates of hell;\r\n

That sits by his hovel fire as oft,\r\n          But hears on his old bare roof aloft\r\n          A belfry burst in song.\r\n\r\n          \"The gates of heaven are lightly locked,\r\n          We do

spoke she was not,\r\n          Nor any word said he,\r\n          He only heard, still as he stood\r\n          Under the old night's nodding hood,\r\n          The sea-folk breaking down the wood\r\n          Like a high tide from sea.\r\n\r\n          He only heard the heathen men,\r\n          Whose eyes are blue and bleak,\r\n          Singing about some cruel thing\r\n          Done by a great and smiling king\r\n          In daylight on a deck.\r\n\r\n          He only heard the heathen men,\r\n          Whose eyes are blue and blind,\r\n          Singing what shameful things

THE GATHERING OF THE CHIEFS\r\n\r\n\r\n          Up across windy wastes and up\r\n          Went Alfred over the shaws,\r\n          Shaken of the joy of giants,\r\n          The joy without a cause.\r\n\r\n          In the slopes away to the western bays,\r\n          Where blows not ever a tree,\r\n          He washed his soul in the west wind\r\n          And his body in the sea.\r\n\r\n          And he set to rhyme his ale-measures,\r\n          And he sang aloud his laws,\r\n          Because of the joy of the giants,\r\n          The joy without a cause.\r\n\r\n          The King went gathering Wessex men,\r\n          As grain out of the chaff\r\n          The few that were alive to die,\r\n          Laughing, as littered skulls that lie\r\n          After lost battles turn to the sky\r\n          An everlasting laugh.\r\n\r\n          The King went gathering Christian men,\r\n          As wheat out of the husk;\r\n          Eldred, the Franklin by the sea,\r\n          And Mark, the man from Italy,\r\n          And Colan of the Sacred Tree,\r\n          From the old tribe on Usk.\r\n\r\n          The rook croaked homeward heavily,\r\n          The west was clear and warm,\r\n          The smoke of evening food and ease\r\n          Rose like a blue tree in the trees\r\n          When he came to Eldred's farm.\r\n\r\n          But Eldred's farm was fallen awry,\r\n          Like an old cripple's bones,\r\n          And Eldred's tools were red with rust,\r\n          And on his well was a green crust,\r\n          And purple thistles upward thrust,\r\n          Between the kitchen stones.\r\n\r\n          But smoke of some good feasting\r\n          Went upwards evermore,\r\n          And Eldred's doors stood wide apart\r\n          For loitering foot or labouring cart,\r\n          And Eldred's great and foolish heart\r\n          Stood open like his door.\r\n\r\n          A mighty man was Eldred,\r\n          A bulk for casks to fill,\r\n          His face a dreaming furnace,\r\n          His body a walking hill.\r\n\r\n          In the old wars of Wessex\r\n          His sword had sunken deep,\r\n          But all his friends, he sighed and said,\r\n          Were broken about Ethelred;\r\n          And between the deep drink and the dead\r\n          He had fallen upon sleep.\r\n\r\n          \"Come not to me, King Alfred, Save always for the ale:\r\n          Why should my harmless hinds be slain\r\n          Because the chiefs cry once again,\r\n          As in all fights, that we shall gain,\r\n          And in all fights we fail?\r\n\r\n          \"Your scalds still thunder and prophesy\r\n          That crown that never comes;\r\n          Friend, I will watch the certain things,\r\n          Swine, and slow moons like silver rings,\r\n          And the ripening of the plums.\"\r\n\r\n          And Alfred answered, drinking,\r\n          And gravely, without blame,\r\n          \"Nor bear I boast of scald or king,\r\n          The thing I bear is a lesser thing,\r\n          But comes in a better name.\r\n\r\n          \"Out of the mouth of the Mother of God,\r\n          More than the doors of doom,\r\n          I call the muster of Wessex men\r\n          From grassy hamlet or ditch or den,\r\n          To break and be broken, God knows when,\r\n          But I have seen for whom.\r\n\r\n          \"Out of the mouth of the Mother of God\r\n          Like a little word come I;\r\n          For I go gathering Christian men\r\n          From sunken paving and ford and fen,\r\n          To die in a battle, God knows when,\r\n          By God, but I know why.\r\n\r\n          \"And this is the word of Mary,\r\n          The word of the world's desire\r\n          'No more of comfort shall ye get,\r\n          Save that the sky grows darker yet\r\n          And the sea rises higher.'\"\r\n\r\n          Then silence sank. And slowly\r\n          Arose the sea-land lord,\r\n          Like some vast beast for mystery,\r\n          He filled the room and porch and sky,\r\n          And from a cobwebbed nail on high\r\n          Unhooked his heavy sword.\r\n\r\n          Up on the shrill sea-downs and up\r\n          Went Alfred all alone,\r\n          Turning but once e'er the door was shut,\r\n          Shouting to Eldred over his butt,\r\n          That he bring all spears to the woodman's hut\r\n          Hewn under Egbert's Stone.\r\n\r\n          And he turned his back and broke the fern,\r\n          And fought the moths of dusk,\r\n          And went on his way for other friends\r\n          Friends fallen of all the wide world's ends,\r\n          From Rome that wrath and pardon sends\r\n          And the grey tribes on Usk.\r\n\r\n          He saw gigantic tracks of death\r\n          And many a shape of doom,\r\n          Good steadings to grey ashes gone\r\n          And a monk's house white like a skeleton\r\n          In the green crypt of the combe.\r\n\r\n          And in many a Roman villa\r\n          Earth and her ivies eat,\r\n          Saw coloured pavements sink and fade\r\n          In flowers, and the windy colonnade\r\n          Like the spectre of a street.\r\n\r\n          But the cold stars clustered\r\n          Among the cold pines\r\n          Ere he was half on his pilgrimage\r\n          Over the western lines.\r\n\r\n          And the white dawn widened\r\n          Ere he came to the last pine,\r\n          Where Mark, the man from Italy,\r\n          Still made the Christian sign.\r\n\r\n          The long farm lay on the large hill-side,\r\n          Flat like a painted plan,\r\n          And by the side the low white house,\r\n          Where dwelt the southland man.\r\n\r\n          A bronzed man, with a bird's bright eye,\r\n          And a strong bird's beak and brow,\r\n          His skin was brown like buried gold,\r\n          And of certain of his sires was told\r\n          That they came in the shining ship of old,\r\n          With Caesar in the prow.\r\n\r\n          His fruit trees stood like soldiers\r\n          Drilled in a straight line,\r\n          His strange, stiff olives did not fail,\r\n          And all the kings of the earth drank ale,\r\n          But he drank wine.\r\n\r\n          Wide over wasted British plains\r\n          Stood never an arch or dome,\r\n          Only the trees to toss and reel,\r\n          The tribes to bicker, the beasts to squeal;\r\n          But the eyes in his head were strong like steel,\r\n          And his soul remembered Rome.\r\n\r\n          Then Alfred of the lonely spear\r\n          Lifted his lion head;\r\n          And fronted with the Italian's eye,\r\n          Asking him of his whence and why,\r\n          King Alfred stood and said:\r\n\r\n          \"I am that oft-defeated King\r\n          Whose failure fills the land,\r\n          Who fled before the Danes of old,\r\n          Who chaffered with the Danes with gold,\r\n          Who now upon the Wessex wold\r\n          Hardly has feet to stand.\r\n\r\n          \"But out of the mouth of the Mother of God\r\n          I have seen the truth like fire,\r\n          This--that the sky grows darker yet\r\n          And the sea rises higher.\"\r\n\r\n          Long looked the Roman on the land;\r\n          The trees as golden crowns\r\n          Blazed, drenched with dawn and dew-empearled\r\n          While faintlier coloured, freshlier curled,\r\n          The clouds from underneath the world\r\n          Stood up over the downs.\r\n\r\n          \"These vines be ropes that drag me hard,\"\r\n          He said. \"I go not far;\r\n          Where would you meet? For you must hold\r\n          Half Wiltshire and the White Horse wold,\r\n          And the Thames bank to Owsenfold,\r\n          If Wessex goes to war.\r\n\r\n          \"Guthrum sits strong on either bank\r\n          And you must press his lines\r\n          Inwards, and eastward drive him down;\r\n          I doubt if you shall take the crown\r\n          Till you have taken London town.\r\n          For me, I have the vines.\"\r\n\r\n          \"If each man on the Judgment Day\r\n          Meet God on a plain alone,\"\r\n          Said Alfred, \"I will speak for you\r\n          As for myself, and call it true\r\n          That you brought all fighting folk you knew\r\n          Lined under Egbert's Stone.\r\n\r\n          \"Though I be in the dust ere then,\r\n          I know where you will be.\"\r\n          And shouldering suddenly his spear\r\n          He faded like some elfin fear,\r\n          Where the tall pines ran up, tier on tier\r\n          Tree overtoppling tree.\r\n\r\n          He shouldered his spear at morning\r\n          And laughed to lay it on,\r\n          But he leaned on his spear as on a staff,\r\n          With might and little mood to laugh,\r\n          Or ever he sighted chick or calf\r\n          Of Colan of Caerleon.\r\n\r\n          For the man dwelt in a lost land\r\n          Of boulders and broken men,\r\n          In a great grey cave far off to the south\r\n          Where a thick green forest stopped the mouth,\r\n          Giving darkness in his den.\r\n\r\n          And the man was come like a shadow,\r\n          From the shadow of Druid trees,\r\n          Where Usk, with mighty murmurings,\r\n          Past Caerleon of the fallen kings,\r\n          Goes out to ghostly seas.\r\n\r\n          Last of a race in ruin--\r\n          He spoke the speech of the Gaels;\r\n          His kin were in holy Ireland,\r\n          Or up in the crags of Wales.\r\n\r\n          But his soul stood with his mother's folk,\r\n          That were of the rain-wrapped isle,\r\n          Where Patrick and Brandan westerly\r\n          Looked out at last on a landless sea\r\n          And the sun's last smile.\r\n\r\n          His harp was carved and cunning,\r\n          As the Celtic craftsman makes,\r\n          Graven all over with twisting shapes\r\n          Like many headless snakes.\r\n\r\n          His harp was carved and cunning,\r\n          His sword prompt and sharp,\r\n          And he was gay when he held the sword,\r\n          Sad when he held the harp.\r\n\r\n          For the great Gaels of Ireland\r\n          Are the men that God made mad,\r\n          For all their wars are merry,\r\n          And all their songs are sad.\r\n\r\n          He kept the Roman order,\r\n          He made the Christian sign;\r\n          But his eyes grew often blind and bright,\r\n          And the sea that rose in the rocks at night\r\n          Rose to his head like wine.\r\n\r\n          He made the sign of the cross of God,\r\n          He knew the Roman prayer,\r\n          But he had unreason in his heart\r\n          Because of the gods that were.\r\n\r\n          Even they that walked on the high cliffs,\r\n          High as the clouds were then,\r\n          Gods of unbearable beauty,\r\n          That broke the hearts of men.\r\n\r\n          And whether in seat or saddle,\r\n          Whether with frown or smile,\r\n          Whether at feast or fight was he,\r\n          He heard the noise of a nameless sea\r\n          On an undiscovered isle.\r\n\r\n          Lifting the great green ivy\r\n          And the great spear lowering,\r\n          One said, \"I am Alfred of Wessex,\r\n          And I am a conquered king.\"\r\n\r\n          And the man of the cave made answer,\r\n          And his eyes were stars of scorn,\r\n          \"And better kings were conquered\r\n          Or ever your sires were born.\r\n\r\n          \"What goddess was your mother,\r\n          What fay your breed begot,\r\n          That you should not die with Uther\r\n          And Arthur and Lancelot?\r\n\r\n          \"But when you win you brag and blow,\r\n          And when you lose you rail,\r\n          Army of eastland yokels\r\n          Not strong enough to fail.\"\r\n\r\n          \"I bring not boast or railing,\"\r\n          Spake Alfred not in ire,\r\n          \"I bring of Our Lady a lesson set,\r\n          This--that the sky grows darker yet\r\n          And the sea rises higher.\"\r\n\r\n          Then Colan of the Sacred Tree\r\n          Tossed his black mane on high,\r\n          And cried, as rigidly he rose,\r\n          \"And if the sea and sky be foes,\r\n          We will tame the sea and sky.\"\r\n\r\n          Smiled Alfred, \"Seek ye a fable\r\n          More dizzy and more dread\r\n          Than all your mad barbarian tales\r\n          Where the sky stands on its head?\r\n\r\n          \"A tale where a man looks down on the sky\r\n          That has long looked down on him;\r\n          A tale where a man can swallow a sea\r\n          That might swallow the seraphim.\r\n\r\n          \"Bring to the hut by Egbert's Stone\r\n          All bills and bows ye have.\"\r\n          And Alfred strode off rapidly,\r\n          And Colan of the Sacred Tree\r\n          Went slowly to his cave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III. THE HARP OF ALFRED\r\n\r\n\r\n          In a tree that yawned and twisted\r\n          The King's few goods were flung,\r\n          A mass-book mildewed, line by line,\r\n          And weapons and a skin of wine,\r\n          And an old harp unstrung.\r\n\r\n          By the yawning tree in the twilight\r\n          The King unbound his sword,\r\n          Severed the harp of all his goods,\r\n          And there in the cool and soundless woods\r\n          Sounded a single chord.\r\n\r\n          Then laughed; and watched the finches flash,\r\n          The sullen flies in swarm,\r\n          And went unarmed over the hills,\r\n          With the harp upon his arm,\r\n\r\n          Until he came to the White Horse Vale\r\n          And saw across the plains,\r\n          In the twilight high and far and fell,\r\n          Like the fiery terraces of hell,\r\n          The camp fires of the Danes--\r\n\r\n          The fires of the Great Army\r\n          That was made of iron men,\r\n          Whose lights of sacrilege and scorn\r\n          Ran around England red as morn,\r\n          Fires over Glastonbury Thorn--\r\n          Fires out on Ely Fen.\r\n\r\n          And as he went by White Horse Vale\r\n          He saw lie wan and wide\r\n          The old horse graven, God knows when,\r\n          By gods or beasts or what things then\r\n          Walked a new world instead of men\r\n          And scrawled on the hill-side.\r\n\r\n          And when he came to White Horse Down\r\n          The great White Horse was grey,\r\n          For it was ill scoured of the weed,\r\n          And lichen and thorn could crawl and feed,\r\n          Since the foes of settled house and creed\r\n          Had swept old works away.\r\n\r\n          King Alfred gazed all sorrowful\r\n          At thistle and mosses grey,\r\n          Till a rally of Danes with shield and bill\r\n          Rolled drunk over the dome of the hill,\r\n          And, hearing of his harp and skill,\r\n          They dragged him to their play.\r\n\r\n          And as they went through the high green grass\r\n          They roared like the great green sea;\r\n          But when they came to the red camp fire\r\n          They were silent suddenly.\r\n\r\n          And as they went up the wastes away\r\n          They went reeling to and fro;\r\n          But when they came to the red camp fire\r\n          They stood all in a row.\r\n\r\n          For golden in the firelight,\r\n          With a smile carved on his lips,\r\n          And a beard curled right cunningly,\r\n          Was Guthrum of the Northern Sea,\r\n          The emperor of the ships--\r\n\r\n          With three great earls King Guthrum\r\n          Went the rounds from fire to fire,\r\n          With Harold, nephew of the King,\r\n          And Ogier of the Stone and Sling,\r\n          And Elf, whose gold lute had a string\r\n          That sighed like all desire.\r\n\r\n          The Earls of the Great Army\r\n          That no men born could tire,\r\n          Whose flames anear him or aloof\r\n          Took hold of towers or walls of proof,\r\n          Fire over Glastonbury roof\r\n          And out on Ely, fire.\r\n\r\n          And Guthrum heard the soldiers' tale\r\n          And bade the stranger play;\r\n          Not harshly, but as one on high,\r\n          On a marble pillar in the sky,\r\n          Who sees all folk that live and die--\r\n          Pigmy and far away.\r\n\r\n          And Alfred, King of Wessex,\r\n          Looked on his conqueror--\r\n          And his hands hardened; but he played,\r\n          And leaving all later hates unsaid,\r\n          He sang of some old British raid\r\n          On the wild west march of yore.\r\n\r\n          He sang of war in the warm wet shires,\r\n          Where rain nor fruitage fails,\r\n          Where England of the motley states\r\n          Deepens like a garden to the gates\r\n          In the purple walls of Wales.\r\n\r\n          He sang of the seas of savage heads\r\n          And the seas and seas of spears,\r\n          Boiling all over Offa's Dyke,\r\n          What time a Wessex club could strike\r\n          The kings of the mountaineers.\r\n\r\n          Till Harold laughed and snatched the harp,\r\n          The kinsman of the King,\r\n          A big youth, beardless like a child,\r\n          Whom the new wine of war sent wild,\r\n          Smote, and began to sing--\r\n\r\n          And he cried of the ships as eagles\r\n          That circle fiercely and fly,\r\n          And sweep the seas and strike the towns\r\n          From Cyprus round to Skye.\r\n\r\n          How swiftly and with peril\r\n          They gather all good things,\r\n          The high horns of the forest beasts,\r\n          Or the secret stones of kings.\r\n\r\n          \"For Rome was given to rule the world,\r\n          And gat of it little joy--\r\n          But we, but we shall enjoy

ivory\r\n          That the Turks sell in the street.\"\r\n\r\n          He sang the song of the thief of the world,\r\n          And the gods that love the thief;\r\n          And he yelled aloud at the cloister-yards,\r\n          Where men go gathering grief.\r\n\r\n          \"Well have you sung, O stranger,\r\n          Of death on the dyke in Wales,\r\n          Your chief was a

was a mighty clerk,\r\n          And had read lines in the Latin books\r\n          When all the north was dark.\r\n\r\n          He said, \"I am older than you, Ogier;\r\n          Not all things

whinnying,\r\n          Were the night's noises when the King\r\n          Shouldering his harp, went home.\r\n\r\n          With eyes of owl and feet of fox,\r\n          Full of all thoughts he went;\r\n          He marked the tilt of the pagan camp,\r\n          The paling of pine, the sentries' tramp,\r\n          And the one great stolen altar-lamp\r\n          Over Guthrum in his tent.\r\n\r\n          By scrub and thorn in Ethandune\r\n          That night the foe had lain;\r\n          Whence ran across the heather grey\r\n          The old stones of a Roman way;\r\n

he went down to the river-hut\r\n          He went as one that fell;\r\n          Seeing the high forest domes and spars.\r\n          Dim green or torn with golden scars,\r\n          As the proud look up at the evil stars,\r\n          In the red heavens of hell.\r\n\r\n          For he must meet by the river-hut\r\n          Them he had bidden to arm,\r\n          Mark from the towers of Italy,\r\n          And Colan of the Sacred Tree,\r\n          And Eldred who beside the sea\r\n          Held heavily his farm.\r\n\r\n          The roof leaned gaping to the grass,\r\n          As a monstrous mushroom lies;\r\n          Echoing and empty seemed the place;\r\n          But opened in a little space\r\n          A great grey woman with scarred face\r\n          And strong and humbled eyes.\r\n\r\n          King Alfred was but a meagre man,\r\n          Bright eyed, but lean and pale:\r\n          And swordless, with his harp and rags,\r\n          He seemed a beggar, such as lags\r\n          Looking for crusts and ale.\r\n\r\n          And the woman, with a woman's eyes\r\n          Of pity at once and ire,\r\n          Said, when that she had glared a span,\r\n          \"There is a cake for any man\r\n          If he will watch the fire.\"\r\n\r\n          And Alfred, bowing heavily,\r\n          Sat down the fire to stir,\r\n          And even as the woman pitied him\r\n          So did he pity her.\r\n\r\n          Saying, \"O great heart in the night,\r\n          O best cast forth for worst,\r\n          Twilight shall melt and morning stir,\r\n          And no kind thing shall come to her,\r\n          Till God shall turn the world over\r\n          And all the last are first.\r\n\r\n          \"And well may God with the serving-folk\r\n

      With Druid beards and Druid spears,\r\n          As a resurrected race appears\r\n          Out of an elder earth.\r\n\r\n          And though the King had called them forth\r\n          And knew them for his own,\r\n          So still each eye stood like a gem,\r\n          So spectral hung each broidered hem,\r\n          Grey carven men he fancied them,\r\n          Hewn in an age of stone.\r\n\r\n          And the two wild peoples of the north\r\n          Stood fronting in the gloam,\r\n          And heard and knew each in its mind\r\n          The third great thunder on the wind,\r\n          The living walls that hedge mankind,\r\n          The walking walls of Rome.\r\n\r\n          Mark's were the mixed tribes of the west,\r\n          Of many a hue and strain,\r\n          Gurth, with rank hair like yellow grass,\r\n          And the Cornish fisher, Gorlias,\r\n          And Halmer, come from his first mass,\r\n          Lately baptized, a Dane.\r\n\r\n          But like one man in armour\r\n          Those hundreds trod the field,\r\n          From red Arabia to the Tyne\r\n          The earth had heard that marching-line,\r\n          Since the cry on the hill Capitoline,\r\n          And the fall of the golden shield.\r\n\r\n          And the earth shook and the King stood still\r\n          Under the greenwood bough,\r\n          And the smoking cake lay at his feet\r\n          And the blow was on his brow.\r\n\r\n          Then Alfred laughed out suddenly,\r\n          Like thunder in the spring,\r\n          Till shook aloud the lintel-beams,\r\n          And the squirrels stirred in dusty dreams,\r\n          And the startled birds went up in streams,\r\n          For the laughter of the King.\r\n\r\n          And the beasts of the earth and the birds looked down,\r\n          In a wild solemnity,\r\n          On a stranger sight than a sylph or elf,\r\n          On one man laughing at himself\r\n          Under the greenwood tree--\r\n\r\n          The giant laughter of Christian men\r\n          That roars through a thousand tales,\r\n          Where greed is an ape and pride is an ass,\r\n          And Jack's away with his master's lass,\r\n          And the miser is banged with all his brass,\r\n          The farmer with all his flails;\r\n\r\n          Tales that tumble and tales that trick,\r\n          Yet end not all in scorning--\r\n          Of kings and clowns in a merry plight,\r\n          And the clock gone wrong and the world gone right,\r\n          That the mummers sing upon Christmas night\r\n          And Christmas Day in the morning.\r\n\r\n          \"Now here is a good warrant,\"\r\n          Cried Alfred, \"by my sword;\r\n          For he that is struck for an ill

ETHANDUNE: THE FIRST STROKE\r\n\r\n\r\n          King Guthrum was a dread king,\r\n          Like death out of the north;\r\n          Shrines without name or number\r\n          He rent and rolled as lumber,\r\n          From Chester to the Humber\r\n          He drove his foemen forth.\r\n\r\n          The Roman villas heard him\r\n          In the valley of the Thames,\r\n          Come over the hills roaring\r\n          Above their roofs, and pouring\r\n          On spire and stair and flooring\r\n          Brimstone and pitch and flames.\r\n\r\n          Sheer o'er the great chalk uplands\r\n          And the hill of the Horse went he,\r\n          Till high on Hampshire beacons\r\n          He saw the southern sea.\r\n\r\n          High on the heights of Wessex\r\n          He saw the southern brine,\r\n          And turned him to a conquered land,\r\n          And where the northern thornwoods stand,\r\n          And the road parts on either hand,\r\n          There came to him a sign.\r\n\r\n          King Guthrum was a war-chief,\r\n          A wise man in the field,\r\n          And though he prospered well, and knew\r\n          How Alfred's folk were sad and few,\r\n          Not less with weighty care he drew\r\n          Long lines for pike and shield.\r\n\r\n          King Guthrum lay on the upper land,\r\n          On a single road at gaze,\r\n          And his foe must come with lean array,\r\n          Up the left arm of the cloven way,\r\n          To the meeting of the ways.\r\n\r\n          And long ere the noise of armour,\r\n          An hour ere the break of light,\r\n          The woods awoke with crash and cry,\r\n          And the birds sprang clamouring harsh and high,\r\n          And the rabbits ran like an elves' army\r\n          Ere Alfred came in sight.\r\n\r\n          The live wood came at Guthrum,\r\n          On foot and claw and wing,\r\n          The nests were noisy overhead,\r\n          For Alfred and the star of red,\r\n          All life went forth, and the forest fled\r\n          Before the face of the King.\r\n\r\n          But halted in the woodways\r\n          Christ's few were grim and grey,\r\n          And each with a small, far, bird-like sight\r\n          Saw the high folly of the fight;\r\n          And though strange joys had grown in the night,\r\n          Despair grew with the day.\r\n\r\n          And when white dawn crawled through the wood,\r\n          Like cold foam of a flood,\r\n          Then weakened every warrior's mood,\r\n          In hope, though not in hardihood;\r\n          And each man sorrowed as he stood\r\n          In the fashion of his blood.\r\n\r\n          For the Saxon Franklin sorrowed\r\n          For the things that had been fair;\r\n          For the dear dead woman, crimson-clad,\r\n          And the great feasts and the friends he had;\r\n          But the Celtic prince's soul was sad\r\n          For the things that never were.\r\n\r\n          In the eyes Italian all things\r\n          But a black laughter died;\r\n          And Alfred flung his shield to earth\r\n          And smote his breast and cried--\r\n\r\n          \"I wronged a man to his slaying,\r\n          And a woman to her shame,\r\n          And once I looked on a sworn maid\r\n          That was wed to the Holy Name.\r\n\r\n          \"And once I took my neighbour's wife,\r\n          That was bound to an eastland man,\r\n          In the starkness of my evil youth,\r\n          Before my griefs began.\r\n\r\n          \"People, if you have

     And all poor men are free.\"\r\n\r\n          Then Eldred of the idle farm\r\n          Leaned on his ancient sword,\r\n          As fell his heavy words and few;\r\n          And his eyes were of such alien blue\r\n          As gleams where the Northman saileth new\r\n          Into an unknown fiord.\r\n\r\n          \"I was a fool and wasted ale--\r\n          My slaves found it sweet;\r\n

Next night a king may starve or sleep,\r\n          But men and birds and beasts shall weep\r\n          At the burial of a fool.\r\n\r\n          \"O, drunkards in my cellar,\r\n          Boys in my apple tree,\r\n          The world grows stern and strange and new,\r\n          And wise men shall govern you,\r\n          And you shall weep for me.\r\n\r\n          \"But yoke me my own oxen,\r\n          Down to my own farm;\r\n          My own dog will whine for me,\r\n          My own friends will bend the knee,\r\n          And the foes I slew openly\r\n          Have never wished me harm.\"\r\n\r\n          And all were moved a little,\r\n          But Colan stood apart,\r\n          Having first pity, and after\r\n          Hearing, like rat in rafter,\r\n          That little worm of laughter\r\n          That eats the Irish heart.\r\n\r\n          And his grey-green eyes were cruel,\r\n          And the smile of his mouth waxed hard,\r\n          And he said, \"And when did Britain\r\n          Become your burying-yard?\r\n\r\n          \"Before the Romans lit the land,\r\n          When schools and monks were none,\r\n          We reared such stones to the sun-god\r\n          As might put out the sun.\r\n\r\n          \"The tall trees of Britain\r\n          We worshipped and were wise,\r\n          But you shall raid the whole land through\r\n          And never a tree shall talk to you,\r\n          Though every leaf is a tongue taught true\r\n          And the forest is full of eyes.\r\n\r\n          \"On one round hill to the seaward\r\n          The trees grow tall and grey\r\n          And the trees talk together\r\n          When all men are away.\r\n\r\n          \"O'er a few round hills forgotten\r\n          The trees grow tall in rings,\r\n          And the trees talk together\r\n          Of many pagan things.\r\n\r\n          \"Yet I could lie and listen\r\n          With a cross upon my clay,\r\n          And hear unhurt for ever\r\n          What the trees of Britain say.\"\r\n\r\n          A proud man was the Roman,\r\n          His speech a single one,\r\n          But his eyes were like an eagle's eyes\r\n          That is staring at the sun.\r\n\r\n          \"Dig for me where I die,\" he said,\r\n          \"If first or last I fall--\r\n          Dead on the fell at the first charge,\r\n          Or dead by Wantage wall;\r\n\r\n          \"Lift not my head from bloody ground,\r\n          Bear not my body home,\r\n          For all the earth is Roman earth\r\n          And I shall die in Rome.\"\r\n\r\n          Then Alfred, King of England,\r\n          Bade blow the horns of war,\r\n          And fling the Golden Dragon out,\r\n          With crackle and acclaim and shout,\r\n          Scrolled and aflame and far.\r\n\r\n          And under the Golden Dragon\r\n          Went Wessex all along,\r\n          Past the sharp point of the cloven ways,\r\n          Out from the black wood into the blaze\r\n          Of sun and steel and song.\r\n\r\n          And when they came to the open land\r\n          They wheeled, deployed and stood;\r\n          Midmost were Marcus and the King,\r\n          And Eldred on the right-hand wing,\r\n          And leftwards Colan darkling,\r\n          In the last shade of the wood.\r\n\r\n          But the Earls of the Great Army\r\n          Lay like a long half moon,\r\n          Ten poles before their palisades,\r\n          With wide-winged helms and runic blades\r\n          Red giants of an age of raids,\r\n          In the thornland of Ethandune.\r\n\r\n          Midmost the saddles rose and swayed,\r\n          And a stir of horses' manes,\r\n          Where Guthrum and a few rode high\r\n          On horses seized in victory;\r\n          But Ogier went on foot to die,\r\n          In the old way of the Danes.\r\n\r\n          Far to the King's left Elf the bard\r\n          Led on the eastern wing\r\n          With songs and spells that change the blood;\r\n          And on the King's right Harold stood,\r\n          The kinsman of the King.\r\n\r\n          Young Harold, coarse, with colours gay,\r\n          Smoking with oil and musk,\r\n          And the pleasant violence of the young,\r\n          Pushed through his people, giving tongue\r\n          Foewards, where, grey as cobwebs hung,\r\n          The banners of the Usk.\r\n\r\n          But as he came before his line\r\n          A little space along,\r\n          His beardless face broke into mirth,\r\n          And he cried: \"What broken bits of earth\r\n          Are here? For what their clothes are worth\r\n          I would sell them for a song.\"\r\n\r\n          For Colan was hung with raiment\r\n          Tattered like autumn leaves,\r\n          And his men were all as thin as saints,\r\n          And all as poor as thieves.\r\n\r\n          No bows nor slings nor bolts they bore,\r\n          But bills and pikes ill-made;\r\n          And none but Colan bore a sword,\r\n          And rusty was its blade.\r\n\r\n          And Colan's eyes with mystery\r\n          And iron laughter stirred,\r\n          And he spoke aloud, but lightly\r\n          Not labouring to be heard.\r\n\r\n          \"Oh, truly we be broken hearts,\r\n          For that cause, it is said,\r\n          We light our candles to that Lord\r\n          That broke Himself for bread.\r\n\r\n          \"But though we hold but bitterly\r\n          What land the Saxon leaves,\r\n          Though Ireland be but a land of saints,\r\n          And Wales a land of thieves,\r\n\r\n          \"I say you yet shall weary\r\n          Of the working of your word,\r\n          That stricken spirits never strike\r\n          Nor lean hands hold a sword.\r\n\r\n          \"And if ever ye ride in Ireland,\r\n          The jest may yet be said,\r\n          There is the land of broken hearts,\r\n          And the land of broken heads.\"\r\n\r\n          Not less barbarian laughter\r\n          Choked Harold like a flood,\r\n          \"And shall I fight with scarecrows\r\n          That am of Guthrum's blood?\r\n\r\n          \"Meeting may be of war-men,\r\n          Where the best war-man wins;\r\n          But all this carrion a man shoots\r\n          Before the fight begins.\"\r\n\r\n          And stopping in his onward strides,\r\n          He snatched a bow in scorn\r\n          From some mean slave, and bent it on\r\n          Colan, whose doom grew dark; and shone\r\n          Stars evil over Caerleon,\r\n          In the place where he was born.\r\n\r\n          For Colan had not bow nor sling,\r\n          On a lonely sword leaned he,\r\n          Like Arthur on Excalibur\r\n          In the battle by the sea.\r\n\r\n          To his great gold ear-ring Harold\r\n          Tugged back the feathered tail,\r\n          And swift had sprung the arrow,\r\n          But swifter sprang the Gael.\r\n\r\n          Whirling the one sword round his head,\r\n          A great wheel in the sun,\r\n          He sent it splendid through the sky,\r\n          Flying before the shaft could fly--\r\n          It smote Earl Harold over the eye,\r\n          And blood began to run.\r\n\r\n          Colan stood bare and weaponless,\r\n          Earl Harold, as in pain,\r\n          Strove for a smile, put hand to head,\r\n          Stumbled and suddenly fell dead;\r\n          And the small white daisies all waxed red\r\n          With blood out of his brain.\r\n\r\n          And all at that marvel of the sword,\r\n          Cast like a stone to slay,\r\n          Cried out. Said Alfred: \"Who would see\r\n          Signs, must give all things. Verily\r\n          Man shall not taste of victory\r\n          Till he throws his sword away.\"\r\n\r\n          Then Alfred, prince of England,\r\n          And all the Christian earls,\r\n          Unhooked their swords and held them up,\r\n          Each offered to Colan, like a cup\r\n          Of chrysolite and pearls.\r\n\r\n          And the King said, \"Do thou take my sword\r\n          Who have done this deed of fire,\r\n          For this is the manner of Christian men,\r\n          Whether of steel or priestly pen,\r\n          That they cast their hearts out of their ken\r\n          To get their heart's desire.\r\n\r\n          \"And whether ye swear a hive of monks,\r\n          Or one fair wife to friend,\r\n          This is the manner of Christian men,\r\n          That their oath endures the end.\r\n\r\n          \"For love, our Lord, at the end of the world,\r\n          Sits a red horse like a throne,\r\n          With a brazen helm and an iron bow,\r\n          But one arrow alone.\r\n\r\n          \"Love with the shield of the Broken Heart\r\n          Ever his bow doth bend,\r\n          With a single shaft for a single prize,\r\n          And the ultimate bolt that parts and flies\r\n          Comes with a thunder of split skies,\r\n          And a sound of souls that rend.\r\n\r\n          \"So shall you earn a king's sword,\r\n          Who cast your sword away.\"\r\n          And the King took, with a random eye,\r\n          A rude axe from a hind hard by\r\n          And turned him to the fray.\r\n\r\n          For the swords of the Earls of Daneland\r\n          Flamed round the fallen lord.\r\n          The first blood woke the trumpet-tune,\r\n          As in monk's rhyme or wizard's rune,\r\n          Beginneth the battle of Ethandune\r\n          With the throwing of the sword.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VI. ETHANDUNE: THE SLAYING OF THE CHIEFS\r\n\r\n\r\n          As the sea flooding the flat sands\r\n          Flew on the sea-born horde,\r\n          The two hosts shocked with dust and din,\r\n          Left of the Latian paladin,\r\n          Clanged all Prince Harold's howling kin\r\n          On Colan and the sword.\r\n\r\n          Crashed in the midst on Marcus,\r\n          Ogier with Guthrum by,\r\n          And eastward of such central stir,\r\n          Far to the right and faintlier,\r\n          The house of Elf the harp-player,\r\n          Struck Eldred's with a cry.\r\n\r\n          The centre swat for weariness,\r\n          Stemming the screaming horde,\r\n          And wearily went Colan's hands\r\n          That swung King Alfred's sword.\r\n\r\n          But like a cloud of morning\r\n          To eastward easily,\r\n          Tall Eldred broke the sea of spears\r\n          As a tall ship breaks the sea.\r\n\r\n          His face like a sanguine sunset,\r\n          His shoulder a Wessex down,\r\n          His hand like a windy hammer-stroke;\r\n          Men could not count the crests he broke,\r\n          So fast the crests went down.\r\n\r\n          As the tall white devil of the Plague\r\n          Moves out of Asian skies,\r\n          With his foot on a waste of cities\r\n          And his head in a cloud of flies;\r\n\r\n          Or purple and peacock skies grow dark\r\n          With a moving locust-tower;\r\n          Or tawny sand-winds tall and dry,\r\n          Like hell's red banners beat and fly,\r\n          When death comes out of Araby,\r\n          Was Eldred in his hour.\r\n\r\n          But while he moved like a massacre\r\n          He murmured as in sleep,\r\n          And his words were all of low hedges\r\n          And little fields and sheep.\r\n\r\n          Even as he strode like a pestilence,\r\n          That strides from Rhine to Rome,\r\n          He thought how tall his beans might be\r\n          If ever he went home.\r\n\r\n          Spoke some stiff piece of childish prayer,\r\n          Dull as the distant chimes,\r\n          That thanked our God for good eating\r\n          And corn and quiet times--\r\n\r\n          Till on the helm of a high chief\r\n          Fell shatteringly his brand,\r\n          And the helm broke and the bone broke\r\n          And the sword broke in his hand.\r\n\r\n          Then from the yelling Northmen\r\n          Driven splintering on him ran\r\n          Full seven spears, and the seventh\r\n          Was never made by man.\r\n\r\n          Seven spears, and the seventh\r\n          Was wrought as the faerie blades,\r\n          And given to Elf the minstrel\r\n          By the monstrous water-maids;\r\n\r\n          By them that dwell where luridly\r\n          Lost waters of the Rhine\r\n          Move among roots of nations,\r\n          Being sunken for a sign.\r\n\r\n          Under all graves they murmur,\r\n          They murmur and rebel,\r\n          Down to the buried kingdoms creep,\r\n          And like a lost rain roar and weep\r\n          O'er the red heavens of hell.\r\n\r\n          Thrice drowned was Elf the minstrel,\r\n          And washed as dead on sand;\r\n          And the third time men found him\r\n          The spear was in his hand.\r\n\r\n          Seven spears went about Eldred,\r\n          Like stays about a mast;\r\n          But there was sorrow by the sea\r\n          For the driving of the last.\r\n\r\n          Six spears thrust upon Eldred\r\n          Were splintered while he laughed;\r\n          One spear thrust into Eldred,\r\n          Three feet of blade and shaft.\r\n\r\n          And from the great heart grievously\r\n          Came forth the shaft and blade,\r\n          And he stood with the face of a dead man,\r\n          Stood a little, and swayed--\r\n\r\n          Then fell, as falls a battle-tower,\r\n          On smashed and struggling spears.\r\n          Cast down from some unconquered town\r\n          That, rushing earthward, carries down\r\n          Loads of live men of all renown--\r\n          Archers and engineers.\r\n\r\n          And a great clamour of Christian men\r\n          Went up in agony,\r\n          Crying, \"Fallen is the tower of Wessex\r\n          That stood beside the sea.\"\r\n\r\n          Centre and right the Wessex guard\r\n          Grew pale for doubt and fear,\r\n          And the flank failed at the advance,\r\n          For the death-light on the wizard lance--\r\n          The star of the evil spear.\r\n\r\n          \"Stand like an oak,\" cried Marcus,\r\n          \"Stand like a Roman wall!\r\n          Eldred the Good is fallen--\r\n          Are you too good to fall?\r\n\r\n          \"When we were wan and bloodless\r\n          He gave you ale enow;\r\n          The pirates deal with him as dung,\r\n          God! are you bloodless now?\"\r\n\r\n          \"Grip, Wulf and

    Leaned back and reeled a space to rear\r\n          As Elf charged with the Rhine maids' spear,\r\n          And roaring like the Rhine.\r\n\r\n          For the men were borne by the waving walls\r\n          Of woods and clouds that pass,\r\n          By dizzy plains and drifting sea,\r\n          And they mixed God with glamoury,\r\n          God with the gods of the burning tree\r\n          And the wizard's tower and glass.\r\n\r\n          But Mark was come of the glittering towns\r\n          Where hot white details show,\r\n          Where men can number and expound,\r\n          And his faith grew in a hard ground\r\n          Of doubt and reason and falsehood found,\r\n          Where no faith else could grow.\r\n\r\n          Belief that grew of all beliefs\r\n          One moment back was blown\r\n          And belief that stood on unbelief\r\n          Stood up iron and alone.\r\n\r\n          The Wessex crescent backwards\r\n          Crushed, as with bloody spear\r\n          Went Elf roaring and routing,\r\n          And Mark against Elf yet shouting,\r\n          Shocked, in his mid-career.\r\n\r\n          Right on the Roman shield and sword\r\n          Did spear of the Rhine maids run;\r\n          But the shield shifted never,\r\n          The sword rang down to sever,\r\n          The great Rhine sang for ever,\r\n          And the songs of Elf were done.\r\n\r\n          And a great thunder of Christian men\r\n          Went up against the sky,\r\n          Saying, \"God hath broken the evil spear\r\n          Ere the good man's blood was dry.\"\r\n\r\n          \"Spears at the charge!\" yelled Mark amain.\r\n          \"Death on the gods of death!\r\n          Over the thrones of doom and blood\r\n          Goeth God that is a craftsman good,\r\n          And gold and iron, earth and wood,\r\n          Loveth and laboureth.\r\n\r\n          \"The fruits leap up in all your farms,\r\n          The lamps in each abode;\r\n

\"The God that heweth kings in oak\r\n          Writeth songs on vellum,\r\n          God of gold and flaming glass,\r\n          Confregit potentias\r\n          Acrcuum, scutum, Gorlias,\r\n          Gladium et bellum.\"\r\n\r\n          Steel and lightning broke about him,\r\n          Battle-bays and palm,\r\n          All the sea-kings swayed among\r\n          Woods of the Wessex arms upflung,\r\n          The trumpet of the Roman tongue,\r\n          The thunder of the psalm.\r\n\r\n          And midmost of that rolling field\r\n          Ran Ogier ragingly,\r\n          Lashing at Mark, who turned his blow,\r\n          And brake the helm about his brow,\r\n          And broke him to his knee.\r\n\r\n          Then Ogier heaved over his head\r\n          His huge round shield of proof;\r\n          But Mark set one foot on the shield,\r\n          One on some sundered rock upheeled,\r\n          And towered above the tossing field,\r\n          A statue on a roof.\r\n\r\n          Dealing far blows about the fight,\r\n          Like thunder-bolts a-roam,\r\n          Like birds about the battle-field,\r\n          While Ogier writhed under his shield\r\n          Like a tortoise in his dome.\r\n\r\n          But hate in the buried Ogier\r\n          Was strong as pain in hell,\r\n          With bare brute hand from the inside\r\n          He burst the shield of brass and hide,\r\n          And a death-stroke to the Roman's side\r\n          Sent suddenly and well.\r\n\r\n          Then the great statue on the shield\r\n          Looked his last look around\r\n          With level and imperial eye;\r\n          And Mark, the man from Italy,\r\n          Fell in the sea of agony,\r\n          And died without a sound.\r\n\r\n          And Ogier, leaping up alive,\r\n          Hurled his huge shield away\r\n          Flying, as when a juggler flings\r\n          A whizzing plate in play.\r\n\r\n          And held two arms up rigidly,\r\n          And roared to all the Danes:\r\n          \"Fallen is Rome, yea, fallen\r\n          The city of the plains!\r\n\r\n          \"Shall no man born remember,\r\n          That breaketh wood or weald,\r\n          How long she stood on the roof of the world\r\n          As he stood on my shield.\r\n\r\n          \"The new wild world forgetteth her\r\n          As foam fades on the sea,\r\n          How long she stood with her foot on Man\r\n          As he with his foot on me.\r\n\r\n          \"No more shall the brown men of the south\r\n          Move like the ants in lines,\r\n          To quiet men with olives\r\n          Or madden men with vines.\r\n\r\n          \"No more shall the white towns of the south,\r\n          Where Tiber and Nilus run,\r\n          Sitting around a secret sea\r\n          Worship a secret sun.\r\n\r\n          \"The blind gods roar for Rome fallen,\r\n          And forum and garland gone,\r\n          For the ice of the north is broken,\r\n          And the sea of the north comes on.\r\n\r\n          \"The blind gods roar and rave and dream\r\n          Of all cities under the sea,\r\n          For the heart of the north is

swirled\r\n          Until we come to the end of the world\r\n          That breaks short, like a cliff.\r\n\r\n          \"And when we come to the end of the world\r\n          For me, I count it fit\r\n          To take the leap like a good river,\r\n          Shot shrieking over it.\r\n\r\n          \"But whatso hap at the end of the world,\r\n          Where Nothing is struck and

that in the wild men back of him,\r\n          There was that in his own wild song,\r\n          A dizzy throbbing, a drunkard smoke,\r\n          That dazed to death all Wessex folk,\r\n          And swept their spears along.\r\n\r\n          Vainly the sword of Colan\r\n          And the axe of Alfred plied--\r\n          The Danes poured in like a brainless plague,\r\n          And knew not when they died.\r\n\r\n          Prince Colan slew a score of them,\r\n          And was stricken to his knee;\r\n          King Alfred slew a score and seven\r\n          And was borne back on a tree.\r\n\r\n          Back to the black gate of the woods,\r\n          Back up the single way,\r\n          Back by the place of the parting ways\r\n          Christ's knights were whirled away.\r\n\r\n          And when they came to the parting ways\r\n          Doom's heaviest hammer fell,\r\n          For the King was beaten, blind, at bay,\r\n          Down the right lane with his array,\r\n          But Colan swept the other way,\r\n          Where he smote great strokes and fell.\r\n\r\n          The thorn-woods over Ethandune\r\n          Stand sharp and thick as spears,\r\n          By night and furze and forest-harms\r\n          Far sundered were the friends in arms;\r\n          The loud lost blows, the last alarms,\r\n          Came not to Alfred's ears.\r\n\r\n          The thorn-woods over Ethandune\r\n          Stand stiff as spikes in mail;\r\n          As to the Haut King came at morn\r\n          Dead Roland on a doubtful horn,\r\n          Seemed unto Alfred lightly borne\r\n          The last cry of the Gael.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VII. ETHANDUNE: THE LAST CHARGE\r\n\r\n\r\n          Away in the waste of White Horse Down\r\n          An idle child alone\r\n          Played some small game through hours that pass,\r\n          And patiently would pluck the grass,\r\n          Patiently push the stone.\r\n\r\n          On the lean, green edge for ever,\r\n          Where the blank chalk touched the turf,\r\n          The child played on, alone, divine,\r\n          As a child plays on the last line\r\n          That sunders sand and surf.\r\n\r\n          For he dwelleth in high divisions\r\n          Too simple to understand,\r\n          Seeing on what morn of mystery\r\n          The Uncreated rent the sea\r\n          With roarings, from the land.\r\n\r\n          Through the long infant hours like days\r\n          He built one tower in vain--\r\n          Piled up small stones to make a town,\r\n          And evermore the stones fell down,\r\n          And he piled them up again.\r\n\r\n          And crimson kings on battle-towers,\r\n          And saints on Gothic spires,\r\n          And hermits on their peaks of snow,\r\n          And heroes on their pyres,\r\n\r\n          And patriots riding royally,\r\n          That rush the rocking town,\r\n          Stretch hands, and hunger and aspire,\r\n          Seeking to mount where high and higher,\r\n          The child whom Time can never tire,\r\n          Sings over White Horse Down.\r\n\r\n          And this was the might of Alfred,\r\n          At the ending of the way;\r\n          That of such smiters, wise or wild,\r\n          He was least distant from the child,\r\n          Piling the stones all day.\r\n\r\n          For Eldred fought like a frank hunter\r\n          That killeth and goeth home;\r\n          And Mark had fought because all arms\r\n          Rang like the name of Rome.\r\n\r\n          And Colan fought with a double mind,\r\n          Moody and madly gay;\r\n          But Alfred fought as gravely\r\n          As a good child at play.\r\n\r\n          He saw wheels break and work run back\r\n          And all things as they were;\r\n          And his heart was orbed like victory\r\n          And simple like despair.\r\n\r\n          Therefore is Mark forgotten,\r\n          That was wise with his tongue and brave;\r\n          And the cairn over Colan crumbled,\r\n          And the cross on Eldred's grave.\r\n\r\n          Their great souls went on a wind away,\r\n          And they have not tale or tomb;\r\n          And Alfred born in Wantage\r\n          Rules England till the doom.\r\n\r\n          Because in the forest of all fears\r\n          Like a strange fresh gust from sea,\r\n          Struck him that ancient innocence\r\n          That is more than mastery.\r\n\r\n          And as a child whose bricks fall down\r\n          Re-piles them o'er and o'er,\r\n          Came ruin and the rain that burns,\r\n          Returning as a wheel returns,\r\n          And crouching in the furze and ferns\r\n          He began his life once more.\r\n\r\n          He took his ivory horn unslung\r\n          And smiled, but not in scorn:\r\n          \"Endeth the Battle of Ethandune\r\n          With the blowing of a horn.\"\r\n\r\n          On a dark horse at the double way\r\n          He saw great Guthrum ride,\r\n          Heard roar of brass and ring of steel,\r\n          The laughter and the trumpet peal,\r\n          The pagan in his pride.\r\n\r\n          And Ogier's red and hated head\r\n          Moved in some talk or task;\r\n          But the men seemed scattered in the brier,\r\n          And some of them had lit a fire,\r\n          And one had broached a cask.\r\n\r\n          And waggons one or two stood up,\r\n          Like tall ships in sight,\r\n          As if an outpost were encamped\r\n          At the cloven ways for night.\r\n\r\n          And joyous of the sudden stay\r\n          Of Alfred's routed few,\r\n          Sat one upon a stone to sigh,\r\n          And some slipped up the road to fly,\r\n          Till Alfred in the fern hard by\r\n          Set horn to mouth and blew.\r\n\r\n          And they all abode like statues--\r\n          One sitting on the stone,\r\n          One half-way through the thorn hedge tall,\r\n          One with a leg across a wall,\r\n          And one looked backwards, very small,\r\n          Far up the road, alone.\r\n\r\n          Grey twilight and a yellow star\r\n          Hung over thorn and hill;\r\n          Two spears and a cloven war-shield lay\r\n          Loose on the road as cast away,\r\n          The horn died faint in the forest grey,\r\n          And the fleeing men stood still.\r\n\r\n          \"Brothers at arms,\" said Alfred,\r\n          \"On this side lies the foe;\r\n          Are slavery and starvation flowers,\r\n          That you should pluck them so?\r\n\r\n          \"For whether is it better\r\n          To be prodded with Danish poles,\r\n          Having hewn a chamber in a ditch,\r\n          And hounded like a howling witch,\r\n          Or smoked to death in holes?\r\n\r\n          \"Or that before the red cock crow\r\n          All we, a thousand strong,\r\n          Go down the dark road to God's house,\r\n          Singing a Wessex song?\r\n\r\n          \"To sweat a slave to a race of slaves,\r\n          To drink up infamy?\r\n          No, brothers, by your leave, I think\r\n          Death is a better ale to drink,\r\n          And by all the stars of Christ that sink,\r\n          The Danes shall drink with me.\r\n\r\n          \"To grow old cowed in a conquered land,\r\n          With the sun itself discrowned,\r\n          To see trees crouch and cattle slink--\r\n          Death is a better ale to drink,\r\n          And by high Death on the fell brink\r\n          That flagon shall go round.\r\n\r\n          \"Though dead are all the paladins\r\n          Whom glory had in ken,\r\n          Though all your thunder-sworded thanes\r\n          With proud hearts died among the Danes,\r\n          While a man remains, great war remains:\r\n          Now is a war of men.\r\n\r\n          \"The men that tear the furrows,\r\n          The men that fell the trees,\r\n          When all their lords be lost and dead\r\n          The bondsmen of the earth shall tread\r\n          The tyrants of the seas.\r\n\r\n          \"The wheel of the roaring stillness\r\n          Of all labours under the sun,\r\n          Speed the wild work as well at least\r\n          As the whole world's work is done.\r\n\r\n          \"Let Hildred hack the shield-wall\r\n          Clean as he hacks the hedge;\r\n          Let Gurth the fowler stand as cool\r\n          As he stands on the chasm's edge;\r\n\r\n          \"Let Gorlias ride the sea-kings\r\n          As Gorlias rides the sea,\r\n          Then let all hell and Denmark drive,\r\n          Yelling to all its fiends alive,\r\n          And not a rag care we.\"\r\n\r\n          When Alfred's word was ended\r\n          Stood firm that feeble line,\r\n          Each in his place with club or spear,\r\n          And fury deeper than deep fear,\r\n          And smiles as sour as brine.\r\n\r\n          And the King held up the horn and said,\r\n          \"See ye my father's horn,\r\n          That Egbert blew in his empery,\r\n          Once, when he rode out commonly,\r\n          Twice when he rode for venery,\r\n          And thrice on the battle-morn.\r\n\r\n          \"But heavier fates have fallen\r\n

two blasts, the hunting sign,\r\n          Because we turn to bay;\r\n          But I will not blow the three blasts,\r\n          Till we be lost or they.\r\n\r\n          \"And now I blow the hunting sign,\r\n          Charge some by rule and rod;\r\n          But when I blow the battle sign,\r\n          Charge all and go to God.\"\r\n\r\n          Wild stared the Danes at the double ways\r\n          Where they loitered, all at large,\r\n          As that dark line for the last time\r\n          Doubled the knee to charge--\r\n\r\n          And caught their weapons clumsily,\r\n          And marvelled how and why--\r\n          In such degree, by rule and rod,\r\n          The people of the peace of God\r\n          Went roaring down to die.\r\n\r\n          And when the last arrow\r\n          Was fitted and was flown,\r\n          When the broken shield hung on the breast,\r\n          And the hopeless lance was laid in rest,\r\n          And the hopeless horn blown,\r\n\r\n          The King looked up, and what he saw\r\n          Was a great light like death,\r\n          For Our Lady stood on the standards rent,\r\n          As lonely and as innocent\r\n          As when between white walls she went\r\n          And the lilies of Nazareth.\r\n\r\n          One instant in a still light\r\n          He saw Our Lady then,\r\n          Her dress was soft as western sky,\r\n          And she was a queen most womanly--\r\n          But she was a queen of men.\r\n\r\n          Over the iron forest\r\n          He saw Our Lady stand,\r\n          Her eyes were sad withouten art,\r\n          And seven swords were in her heart--\r\n          But one was in her hand.\r\n\r\n          Then the last charge went blindly,\r\n          And all too lost for fear:\r\n          The Danes closed round, a roaring ring,\r\n          And twenty clubs rose o'er the King,\r\n          Four Danes hewed at him, halloing,\r\n          And Ogier of the Stone and Sling\r\n          Drove at him with a spear.\r\n\r\n          But the Danes were wild with laughter,\r\n          And the great spear swung wide,\r\n          The point stuck to a straggling tree,\r\n          And either host cried suddenly,\r\n          As Alfred leapt aside.\r\n\r\n          Short time had shaggy Ogier\r\n          To pull his lance in line--\r\n          He knew King Alfred's axe on high,\r\n          He heard it rushing through the sky,\r\n\r\n          He cowered beneath it with a cry--\r\n          It split him to the spine:\r\n          And Alfred sprang over him dead,\r\n          And blew the battle sign.\r\n\r\n          Then bursting all and blasting\r\n          Came Christendom like death,\r\n          Kicked of such catapults of will,\r\n          The staves shiver, the barrels spill,\r\n          The waggons waver and crash and kill\r\n          The waggoners beneath.\r\n\r\n          Barriers go backwards, banners rend,\r\n          Great shields groan like a gong--\r\n          Horses like horns of nightmare\r\n          Neigh horribly and long.\r\n\r\n          Horses ramp high and rock and boil\r\n          And break their golden reins,\r\n          And slide on carnage clamorously,\r\n          Down where the bitter blood doth lie,\r\n          Where Ogier went on foot to die,\r\n          In the old way of the Danes.\r\n\r\n          \"The high tide!\" King Alfred cried.\r\n          \"The high tide and the turn!\r\n          As a tide turns on the tall grey seas,\r\n          See how they waver in the trees,\r\n

And the storm-cloud drifts from city and dale,\r\n          And the White Horse stamps in the White Horse Vale,\r\n          And we all shall yet drink Christian ale\r\n          In the village of our name.\r\n\r\n          \"The Mother of God goes over them,\r\n          On dreadful cherubs borne;\r\n          And the psalm is roaring above the rune,\r\n          And the Cross goes over the sun and moon,\r\n          Endeth the battle of Ethandune\r\n          With the blowing of a horn.\"\r\n\r\n          For back indeed disorderly\r\n          The Danes went clamouring,\r\n          Too worn to take anew the tale,\r\n          Or dazed with insolence and ale,\r\n          Or stunned of heaven, or stricken pale\r\n          Before the face of the King.\r\n\r\n          For dire was Alfred in his hour\r\n          The pale scribe witnesseth,\r\n          More mighty in defeat was he\r\n          Than all men else in victory,\r\n          And behind, his men came murderously,\r\n          Dry-throated, drinking death.\r\n\r\n          And Edgar of the Golden Ship\r\n          He slew with his own hand,\r\n          Took Ludwig from his lady's bower,\r\n          And smote down Harmar in his hour,\r\n          And vain and lonely stood the tower--\r\n          The tower in Guelderland.\r\n\r\n          And Torr out of his tiny boat,\r\n          Whose eyes beheld the Nile,\r\n          Wulf with his war-cry on his lips,\r\n          And Harco born in the eclipse,\r\n          Who blocked the Seine with battleships\r\n          Round Paris on the Isle.\r\n\r\n          And Hacon of the Harvest-Song,\r\n          And Dirck from the Elbe he slew,\r\n          And Cnut that melted Durham bell\r\n          And Fulk and fiery Oscar fell,\r\n          And Goderic and Sigael,\r\n          And Uriel of the Yew.\r\n\r\n          And highest sang the slaughter,\r\n          And fastest fell the slain,\r\n          When from the wood-road's blackening throat\r\n          A crowning and crashing wonder smote\r\n          The rear-guard of the Dane.\r\n\r\n          For the dregs of Colan's company--\r\n          Lost down the other road--\r\n          Had gathered and grown and heard the din,\r\n          And with wild yells came pouring in,\r\n          Naked as their old British kin,\r\n          And bright with blood for woad.\r\n\r\n          And bare and bloody and aloft\r\n          They bore before their band\r\n          The body of the mighty lord,\r\n          Colan of Caerleon and its horde,\r\n          That bore King Alfred's battle-sword\r\n          Broken in his left hand.\r\n\r\n          And a strange music went with him,\r\n          Loud and yet strangely far;\r\n          The wild pipes of the western land,\r\n          Too keen for the ear to understand,\r\n          Sang high and deathly on each hand\r\n          When the dead man went to war.\r\n\r\n          Blocked between ghost and buccaneer,\r\n          Brave men have dropped and died;\r\n          And the wild sea-lords well might quail\r\n          As the ghastly war-pipes of the Gael\r\n          Called to the horns of White Horse Vale,\r\n          And all the horns replied.\r\n\r\n          And Hildred the poor hedger\r\n          Cut down four captains dead,\r\n          And Halmar laid three others low,\r\n          And the great earls wavered to and fro\r\n          For the living and the dead.\r\n\r\n          And Gorlias grasped the great flag,\r\n          The Raven of Odin, torn;\r\n          And the eyes of Guthrum altered,\r\n          For the first time since morn.\r\n\r\n          As a turn of the wheel of tempest\r\n          Tilts up the whole sky tall,\r\n          And cliffs of wan cloud luminous\r\n          Lean out like great walls over us,\r\n          As if the heavens might fall.\r\n\r\n          As such a tall and tilted sky\r\n          Sends certain snow or light,\r\n          So did the eyes of Guthrum change,\r\n          And the turn was more certain and more strange\r\n          Than a thousand men in flight.\r\n\r\n          For not till the floor of the skies is split,\r\n          And hell-fire shines through the sea,\r\n          Or the stars look up through the rent earth's knees,\r\n          Cometh such rending of certainties,\r\n          As when one wise man truly sees\r\n          What is more wise than he.\r\n\r\n          He set his horse in the battle-breech\r\n          Even Guthrum of the Dane,\r\n          And as ever had fallen fell his brand,\r\n          A falling tower o'er many a land,\r\n          But Gurth the fowler laid one hand\r\n          Upon this bridle rein.\r\n\r\n          King Guthrum was a great lord,\r\n          And higher than his gods--\r\n          He put the popes to laughter,\r\n          He chid the saints with rods,\r\n\r\n          He took this hollow world of ours\r\n          For a cup to hold his wine;\r\n          In the parting of the woodways\r\n          There came to him a sign.\r\n\r\n          In Wessex in the forest,\r\n          In the breaking of the spears,\r\n          We set a sign on Guthrum\r\n          To blaze a thousand years.\r\n\r\n          Where the high saddles jostle\r\n          And the horse-tails toss,\r\n          There rose to the birds flying\r\n          A roar of dead and dying;\r\n          In deafness and strong crying\r\n          We signed him with the cross.\r\n\r\n          Far out to the winding river\r\n          The blood ran down for days,\r\n          When we put the cross on Guthrum\r\n          In the parting of the ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VIII. THE SCOURING OF THE HORSE\r\n\r\n\r\n          In the years of the peace of Wessex,\r\n          When the good King sat at home;\r\n          Years following on that bloody boon\r\n          When she that stands above the moon\r\n          Stood above death at Ethandune\r\n          And saw his kingdom come--\r\n\r\n          When the pagan people of the sea\r\n          Fled to their palisades,\r\n          Nailed there with javelins to cling\r\n          And wonder smote the pirate king,\r\n          And brought him to his christening\r\n          And the end of all his raids.\r\n\r\n          (For not till the night's blue slate is wiped\r\n          Of its last star utterly,\r\n          And fierce new signs writ there to read,\r\n          Shall eyes with such amazement heed,\r\n          As when a great man knows indeed\r\n          A greater thing than he.)\r\n\r\n          And there came to his chrism-loosing\r\n          Lords of all lands afar,\r\n          And a line was drawn north-westerly\r\n          That set King Egbert's empire free,\r\n          Giving all lands by the northern sea\r\n          To the sons of the northern star.\r\n\r\n          In the days of the rest of Alfred,\r\n          When all these things were done,\r\n          And Wessex lay in a patch of peace,\r\n          Like a dog in a patch of sun--\r\n\r\n          The King sat in his orchard,\r\n          Among apples green and red,\r\n          With the little book in his bosom\r\n          And the sunshine on his head.\r\n\r\n          And he gathered the songs of simple men\r\n          That swing with helm and hod,\r\n          And the alms he gave as a Christian\r\n          Like a river alive with fishes ran;\r\n          And he made gifts to a beggar man\r\n          As to a wandering god.\r\n\r\n          And he gat good laws of the ancient kings,\r\n          Like treasure out of the tombs;\r\n          And many a thief in thorny nook,\r\n          Or noble in sea-stained turret shook,\r\n          For the opening of his iron book,\r\n          And the gathering of the dooms.\r\n\r\n          Then men would come from the ends of the earth,\r\n          Whom the King sat welcoming,\r\n          And men would go to the ends of the earth\r\n          Because of the word of the King.\r\n\r\n          For folk came in to Alfred's face\r\n          Whose javelins had been hurled\r\n          On monsters that make boil the sea,\r\n          Crakens and coils of mystery.\r\n          Or thrust in ancient snows that be\r\n          The white hair of the world.\r\n\r\n          And some had knocked at the northern gates\r\n          Of the ultimate icy floor,\r\n          Where the fish freeze and the foam turns black,\r\n          And the wide world narrows to a track,\r\n          And the other sea at the world's back\r\n          Cries through a closed door.\r\n\r\n          And men went forth from Alfred's face,\r\n          Even great gift-bearing lords,\r\n          Not to Rome only, but more bold,\r\n          Out to the high hot courts of old,\r\n          Of negroes clad in cloth of gold,\r\n          Silence, and crooked swords,\r\n\r\n          Scrawled screens and secret gardens\r\n          And insect-laden skies--\r\n          Where fiery plains stretch on and on\r\n          To the purple country of Prester John\r\n          And the walls of Paradise.\r\n\r\n          And he knew the might of the Terre Majeure,\r\n          Where kings began to reign;\r\n          Where in a night-rout, without name,\r\n          Of gloomy Goths and Gauls there came\r\n          White, above candles all aflame,\r\n          Like a vision, Charlemagne.\r\n\r\n          And men, seeing such embassies,\r\n          Spake with the King and said:\r\n          \"The steel that sang so sweet a tune\r\n          On Ashdown and on Ethandune,\r\n          Why hangs it scabbarded so soon,\r\n          All heavily like lead?\r\n\r\n          \"Why dwell the Danes in North England,\r\n          And up to the river ride?\r\n          Three more such marches like thine own\r\n          Would end them;
