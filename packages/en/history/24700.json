Qualified in\r\nknowledge I was not, and could not be. No one can pretend to know\r\nthe whole of a vast literature. He may have opened many books and\r\nturned many pages; he cannot have penetrated to the soul of all books\r\nfrom the _Song of Roland_ to _Toute la Lyre_. Without reaching its\r\nspirit, to read a book is little more than to amuse the eye with printed\r\ntype.\r\n\r\nAn adequate history of a great literature can be written only by\r\ncollaboration. Professor Petit de Julleville, in the excellent\r\n_Histoire de la Langue et de la Litterature Francaise_, at present\r\nin process of publication, has his well-instructed specialist for\r\neach chapter. In this small volume I too, while constantly exercising\r\nmy own judgment, have had my collaborators--the ablest and most\r\nlearned students of French literature--who have written each a part\r\nof my book, while somehow it seems that I have written the whole.\r\nMy collaborators are on my shelves. Without them I could not have\r\naccomplished my task; here I give them credit for their assistance.\r\nSome have written general histories of French literature; some have\r\nwritten histories of periods--the Middle Ages, the sixteenth,\r\nseventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth centuries; some have studied\r\nspecial literary fields or forms--the novel, the drama, tragedy,\r\ncomedy, lyrical poetry, history, philosophy; many have written\r\nmonographs on great authors; many have written short critical studies\r\nof books or groups of books. I have accepted from each a gift. But\r\nmy assistants needed to be controlled; they brought me twenty thousand\r\npages, and that was too much. Some were accurate in statement of fact,\r\nbut lacked ideas; some had ideas, but disregarded accuracy of\r\nstatement; some unjustly depreciated the seventeenth century, some\r\nthe eighteenth. For my purposes their work had to be rewritten; and\r\nso it happens that this book is mine as well as theirs.\r\n\r\nThe sketch of mediaeval literature follows the arrangement of matter\r\nin the two large volumes of M. Petit de Julleville and his\r\nfellow-labourers, to whom and to the writings of M. Gaston Paris I\r\nam on almost every page indebted. Many matters in dispute have here\r\nto be briefly stated in one way; there is no space for discussion.\r\nProvencal literature does not appear in this volume. It is omitted\r\nfrom the History of M. Petit de Julleville and from that of M. Lanson.\r\nIn truth, except as an influence, it forms no part of literature in\r\nthe French language.\r\n\r\nThe reader who desires guidance in bibliography will find it at the\r\nclose of each chapter of the History edited by M. Petit de Julleville,\r\nless fully in the notes to M. Lanson's History, and an excellent table\r\nof critical and biographical studies is appended to each volume of\r\nM. Lintilhac's _Histoire de la Litterature Francaise_. M. Lintilhac,\r\nhowever, omits many important English and German titles--among\r\nothers, if I am not mistaken, those of Birsch-Hirschfeld's\r\n_Geschichte der Franzosichen Litteratur: die Zeit der Renaissance_,\r\nof Lotheissen's important _Geschichte der Franzosichen Litteratur\r\nim XVII. Jahrhundert_, and of Professor Flint's learned _Philosophy\r\nof History_ (1893).\r\n\r\nM. Lanson's work has been of great service in guiding me in the\r\narrangement of my subjects, and in giving me courage to omit many\r\nnames of the second or third rank which might be expected to appear\r\nin a history of French literature. In a volume like the present,\r\nselection is important, and I have erred more by inclusion than by\r\nexclusion. The limitation of space has made me desire to say no word\r\nthat does not tend to bring out something essential or characteristic.\r\n\r\nM. Lanson has ventured to trace French literature to the present\r\nmoment. I have thought it wiser to close my survey with the decline\r\nof the romantic movement. With the rise of naturalism a new period\r\nopens. The literature of recent years is rather a subject for current\r\ncriticism than for historical study.\r\n\r\nI cannot say how often I have been indebted to the writings of M.\r\nBrunetiere, M. Faguet, M. Larroumet, M. Paul Stapfer, and other living\r\ncritics: to each of the volumes of _Les Grands Ecrivains Francais_,\r\nand to many of the volumes of the _Classiques Populaires_. M.\r\nLintilhac's edition of Merlet's _Etudes Litteraires_ has also often\r\nserved me. But to name my aids to study would be to fill some pages.\r\n\r\nWhile not unmindful of historical and social influences, I desire\r\nespecially to fix my reader's attention on great individuals, their\r\nideas, their feelings, and their art. The general history of ideas\r\nshould, in the first instance, be discerned by the student of\r\nliterature through his observation of individual minds.\r\n\r\nThat errors must occur where so many statements are made, I am aware\r\nfrom past experience; but I have taken no slight pains to attain\r\naccuracy. It must not be hastily assumed that dates here recorded\r\nare incorrect because they sometimes differ from those given in other\r\nbooks. For my errors I must myself bear the responsibility; but by\r\nthe editorial care of Mr. Gosse, in reading the proof-sheets of this\r\nbook, the number of such errors has been reduced.\r\n\r\n                                                           EDWARD DOWDEN.\r\n\r\nDUBLIN, _June_ 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n_BOOK THE FIRST_--_THE MIDDLE AGES_\r\n\r\nCHAPTER                                                          PAGE\r\n   I.

From the union of feudalism\r\nand Christianity arose the chivalric ideals, the new courtesy, the\r\nhomage to woman. Abstract ideas, ethical, theological, and those of\r\namorous metaphysics, were rendered through allegory into art.\r\nAgainst these high conceptions, and the overstrained sentiment\r\nconnected with them, the positive intellect and the mocking temper\r\nof France reacted; a literature of satire arose. By degrees the\r\nbourgeois spirit encroached upon and overpowered the chivalric\r\nideals. At length the mediaeval conceptions were exhausted.\r\nLiterature dwindled as its sources were impoverished; ingenuities\r\nand technical formalities replaced imagination. The minds of men were\r\nprepared to accept the new influences of the Renaissance and the\r\nReformation.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\nNARRATIVE RELIGIOUS POETRY\r\n\r\nThe oldest monument of the French language is found in the Strasburg\r\nOaths (842); the oldest French poem possessing literary merit is the\r\n_Vie de Saint Alexis_, of which a redaction belonging to the middle\r\nof the eleventh century survives. The passion of piety and the passion\r\nof combat, the religious and the warrior motives, found early\r\nexpression in literature; from the first arose the Lives of Saints\r\nand other devout writings, from the second arose the _chansons de\r\ngeste_. They grew side by side, and had a like manner of development.\r\nIf one takes precedence of the other, it is only because by the chances\r\nof time _Saint Alexis_ remains to us, and the forerunners of the\r\n_Chanson de Roland_ are lost. With each species of poetry\r\n_cantilenes_--short lyrico-epic poems--preceded the narrative form.\r\nBoth the profane and what may be called the religious _chanson de\r\ngeste_ were sung or recited by the same jongleurs--men of a class\r\nsuperior to the vulgar purveyors of amusement. Gradually the poems\r\nof both kinds expanded in length, and finally prose narrative took\r\nthe place of verse.\r\n\r\nThe Lives of Saints are in the main founded on Latin originals; the\r\nnames of their authors are commonly unknown. _Saint Alexis_, a tale\r\nof Syriac origin, possibly the work of Tedbalt, a canon of Vernon,\r\nconsists of 125 stanzas, each of five lines which are bound together\r\nby a single assonant rhyme. It tells of the chastity and poverty of\r\nthe saint, who flies from his virgin bride, lives among beggars,\r\nreturns unrecognised to his father's house, endures the insults of\r\nthe servants, and, dying at Rome, receives high posthumous honours;\r\nfinally, he is rejoined by his wife--the poet here adding to the\r\nlegend--in the presence of God, among the company of the angels. Some\r\nof the sacred poems are derived from the Bible, rhymed versions of\r\nwhich were part of the jongleur's equipment; some from the apocryphal\r\ngospels, or legends of Judas, of Pilate, of the Cross, or, again,\r\nfrom the life of the Blessed Virgin. The literary value of these is\r\ninferior to that of the versified Lives of the Saints. About the tenth\r\ncentury the marvels of Eastern hagiography became known in France,\r\nand gave a powerful stimulus to the devout imagination. A certain\r\nrivalry existed between the claims of profane and religious\r\nliterature, and a popular audience for narrative poems designed for\r\nedification was secured by their recital in churches. Wholly fabulous\r\nsome of these are--as the legend of St. Margaret--but they were not\r\non this account the less welcome or the less esteemed. In certain\r\ninstances the tale is dramatically placed in the mouth of a narrator,\r\nand thus the way was in a measure prepared for the future\r\nmystery-plays.\r\n\r\nMore than fifty of these Lives of Saints are known, composed generally\r\nin octosyllabic verse, and varying in length from some hundreds of\r\nlines to ten thousand. In the group which treats of the national saints\r\nof France, an element of history obscured by errors, extravagances,\r\nand anachronisms may be found. The purely legendary matter occupies\r\na larger space in those derived from the East, in which the religious\r\nideal is that of the hermit life. The celebrated _Barlaam et Joasaph_,\r\nin which Joasaph, son of a king of India, escaping from his father's\r\nrestraints, fulfils his allotted life as a Christian ascetic, is\r\ntraceable to a Buddhist source. The narratives of Celtic origin--such\r\nas those of the Purgatory of St. Patrick and the voyages of St.\r\nBrendan--are coloured by a tender mysticism, and sometimes charm us\r\nwith a strangeness of adventure, in which a feeling for external\r\nnature, at least in its aspects of wonder, appears. The Celtic saints\r\nare not hermits of the desert, but travellers or pilgrims. Among the\r\nlives of contemporary saints, by far the most remarkable is that of\r\nour English Becket by Garnier de Pont-Sainte-Maxence. Garnier had\r\nhimself known the archbishop; he obtained the testimony of witnesses\r\nin England; he visited the places associated with the events of\r\nBecket's life; his work has high value as an historical document;\r\nit possesses a personal accent, rare in such writings; a genuine\r\ndramatic vigour; and great skill and harmonious power in its stanzas\r\nof five rhyming lines.\r\n\r\nA body of short poems, inspired by religious feeling, and often\r\ntelling of miracles obtained by the intercession of the Virgin or\r\nthe saints, is known as _Contes pieux_. Many of these were the work\r\nof Gautier de Coinci (1177-1236), a Benedictine monk; he translates\r\nfrom Latin sources, but with freedom, adding matter of his own, and\r\nin the course of his pious narratives gives an image, far from\r\nflattering, of the life and manners of his own time. It is he who\r\ntells of the robber who, being accustomed to commend himself in his\r\nadventures to our Lady, was supported on the gibbet for three days\r\nby her white hands, and received his pardon; and of the illiterate\r\nmonk who suffered shame because he knew no more than his _Ave Maria_,\r\nbut who, when dead, was proved a holy man by the five roses that came\r\nfrom his mouth in honour of the five letters of Maria's name; and\r\nof the nun who quitted her convent to lead a life of disorder, yet\r\nstill addressed a daily prayer to the Virgin, and who, returning after\r\nlong years, found that the Blessed Mary had filled her place, and\r\nthat her absence was unknown. The collection known as _Vies des Peres_\r\nexhibits the same naivete of pious feeling and imagination. Man is\r\nweak and sinful; but by supernatural aid the humble are exalted,\r\nsinners are redeemed, and the suffering innocent are avenged. Even\r\nTheophile, the priest who sold his soul to the devil, on repentance\r\nreceives back from the Queen of Heaven the very document by which\r\nhe had put his salvation in pawn. The sinner (_Chevalier au barillet_)\r\nwho endeavours for a year to fill the hermit's little cask at running\r\nstreams, and endeavours in vain, finds it brimming the moment one\r\ntear of true penitence falls into the vessel. Most exquisite in its\r\nfeeling is the tale of the _Tombeur de Notre-Dame_--a poor acrobat--a\r\njongleur turned monk--who knows not even the _Pater noster_ or the\r\n_Credo_, and can only offer before our Lady's altar his tumbler's\r\nfeats; he is observed, and as he sinks worn-out and faint before the\r\nshrine, the Virgin is seen to descend, with her angelic attendants,\r\nand to wipe away the sweat from her poor servant's forehead. If there\r\nbe no other piety in such a tale as this, there is at least the piety\r\nof human pity.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\nTHE NATIONAL EPIC\r\n\r\nGreat events and persons, a religious and national spirit, and a\r\ngenius for heroic narrative being given, epic literature arises, as\r\nit were, inevitably. Short poems, partly narrative, partly lyrical,\r\ncelebrate victories or defeats, the achievements of conquerors or\r\ndefenders, and are sung to relieve or to sustain the passion of the\r\ntime. The French epopee had its origin in the national songs of the\r\nGermanic invaders of Gaul, adopted from their conquerors by the\r\nGallo-Romans. With the baptism of Clovis at Reims, and the acceptance\r\nof Christianity by the Franks (496), a national consciousness began\r\nto exist--a national and religious ideal arose. Epic heroes--Clovis,\r\nClotaire, Dagobert, Charles Martel--became centres for the popular\r\nimagination; an echo of the Dagobert songs is found in _Floovent_,\r\na poem of the twelfth century; eight Latin lines, given in the _Vie\r\nde Saint Faron_ by Helgaire, Bishop of Meaux, preserve, in their\r\nninth-century rendering, a fragment of the songs which celebrated\r\nClotaire II. Doubtless more and more in these lost _cantilenes_ the\r\nGerman element yielded to the French, and finally the two streams\r\nof literature--French and German--separated; gradually, also, the\r\nlyrical element yielded to the epic, and the _chanson de geste_ was\r\ndeveloped from these songs.\r\n\r\nIn Charlemagne, champion of Christendom against Islam, a great epic\r\nfigure appeared; on his person converged the epic interest; he may\r\nbe said to have absorbed into himself, for the imagination of the\r\nsingers and the people, the persons of his predecessors, and even,\r\nat a later time, of his successors; their deeds became his deeds,\r\ntheir fame was merged in his; he stood forth as the representative\r\nof France. We may perhaps regard the ninth century as the period of\r\nthe transformation of the _cantilenes_ into the _chansons de geste_;\r\nin the fragment of Latin prose of the tenth century--reduced to prose\r\nfrom hexameters, but not completely reduced--discovered at La Haye\r\n(and named after the place of its discovery), is found an epic episode\r\nof Carlovingian war, probably derived from a _chanson de geste_ of\r\nthe preceding century. In each _chanson_ the _gesta_,[1] the deeds\r\nor achievements of a heroic person, are glorified, and large as may\r\nbe the element of invention in these poems, a certain historical basis\r\nor historical germ may be found, with few exceptions, in each. Roland\r\nwas an actual person, and a battle was fought at Roncevaux in 778.\r\nWilliam of Orange actually encountered the Saracens at Villedaigne\r\nin 793. Renaud de Montauban lived and fought, not indeed against\r\nCharlemagne, but against Charles Martel. Ogier, Girard de Roussillon,\r\nRaoul de Cambrai, were not mere creatures of the fancy. Even when\r\nthe narrative records no historical series of events, it may express\r\ntheir general significance, and condense into itself something of\r\nthe spirit of an epoch. In the course of time, however, fantasy made\r\na conquest of the historical domain; a way for the triumph of fantasy\r\nhad been opened by the incorporation of legend into the narrative,\r\nwith all its wild exaggerations, its reckless departures from truth,\r\nits conventional types of character, its endlessly-repeated\r\nincidents of romance--the child nourished by wild beasts, the combat\r\nof unrecognised father and son, the hero vulnerable only in one point,\r\nthe vindication of the calumniated wife or maiden; and by the\r\nover-labour of fantasy, removed far from nature and reality, the epic\r\nmaterial was at length exhausted.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Gestes_ meant (1) deeds, (2) their history, (3) the\r\nheroic family.]\r\n\r\nThe oldest surviving _chanson de geste_ is the SONG OF ROLAND, and\r\nit is also the best. The disaster of Roncevaux, probably first sung\r\nin _cantilenes_, gave rise to other chansons, two of which, of earlier\r\ndate than the surviving poem, can in a measure be reconstructed from\r\nthe Chronicle of Turpin and from a Latin _Carmen de proditione\r\nGuenonis_. These, however, do not detract from the originality of\r\nthe noble work in our possession, some of the most striking episodes\r\nof which are not elsewhere found. The oldest manuscript is at Oxford,\r\nand the last line has been supposed to give the author's\r\nname--Touroude (Latinised \"Turoldus\")--but this may have been the\r\nname of the jongleur who sang, or the transcriber who copied. The\r\ndate of the poem lies between that of the battle of Hastings, 1066,\r\nwhere the minstrel Taillefer sang in other words the deeds of Roland,\r\nand the year 1099. The poet was probably a Norman, and he may have\r\nbeen one of the Norman William's followers in the invasion of England.\r\n\r\nMore than any other poem, the _Chanson de Roland_ deserves to be named\r\nthe Iliad of the Middle Ages. On August 15, 778, the rearguard of\r\nCharlemagne's army, returning from a successful expedition to the\r\nnorth of Spain, was surprised and destroyed by Basque mountaineers\r\nin the valley of Roncevaux. Among those who fell was Hrodland (Roland),\r\nCount of the march of Brittany. For Basques, the singers substituted\r\na host of Saracens, who, after promise of peace, treacherously attack\r\nthe Franks, with the complicity of Roland's enemy, the traitor Ganelon.\r\nBy Roland's side is placed his companion-in-arms, Olivier, brave but\r\nprudent, brother of Roland's betrothed, _la belle Aude_, who learns\r\nher lover's death, and drops dead at the feet of Charlemagne. In fact\r\nbut thirty-six years of age, Charlemagne is here a majestic old man,\r\n_a la barbe fleurie_, still full of heroic vigour. Around him are\r\nhis great lords--Duke Naime, the Nestor of this Iliad; Archbishop\r\nTurpin, the warrior prelate; Oger the Dane; the traitor Ganelon. And\r\noverhead is God, who will send his angels to bear heavenwards the\r\nsoul of the gallant Roland. The idea of the poem is at once national\r\nand religious--the struggle between France, as champion of\r\nChristendom, and the enemies of France and of God. Its spirit is that\r\nof the feudal aristocracy of the eleventh century. The characters\r\nare in some degree representative of general types, but that of Roland\r\nis clearly individualised; the excess of soldierly pride which will\r\nnot permit him, until too late, to sound his horn and recall\r\nCharlemagne to his aid, is a glorious fault. When all his comrades\r\nhave fallen, he still continues the strife; and when he dies, it is\r\nwith his face to the retreating foe. His fall is not unavenged on\r\nthe Saracens and on the traitor. The poem is written in decasyllabic\r\nverse--in all 4000 lines--divided into sections or _laisses_ of\r\nvarying length, the lines of each _laisse_ being held together by\r\na single assonance.[2] And such is the form in which the best _chansons\r\nde geste_ are written. The decasyllabic line, derived originally from\r\npopular Latin verse, rhythmical rather than metrical, such as the\r\nRoman legionaries sang, is the favourite verse of the older chansons.\r\nThe alexandrine,[3] first seen in the _Pelerinage de Jerusalem_ of\r\nthe early years of the twelfth century, in general indicates later\r\nand inferior work. The _laisse_, bound in one by its identical\r\nassonance, might contain five lines or five hundred. In chansons of\r\nlate date the full rhyme often replaces assonance; but inducing, as\r\nit did in unskilled hands, artificial and feeble expansions of the\r\nsense, rhyme was a cause which co-operated with other causes in the\r\ndecline of this form of narrative poetry.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Assonance_, _i.e._ vowel-rhyme, without an agreement\r\nof consonants.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Verse of twelve syllables, with cesura after the sixth\r\naccented syllable. In the decasyllabic line the cesura generally\r\nfollowed the fourth, but sometimes the sixth, tonic syllable.]\r\n\r\nNaturally the chansons which celebrated the achievements of one epic\r\npersonage or one heroic family fell into a group, and the idea of\r\ncycles of songs having arisen, the later poets forced many independent\r\nsubjects to enter into the so-called cycle of the king (Charlemagne),\r\nor that of William of Orange, or that of Doon of Mayence. The second\r\nof these had, indeed, a genuine cyclic character: it told of the\r\nresistance of the south of France to the Mussulmans. The last cycle\r\nto develop was that of the Crusades. Certain poems or groups of poems\r\nmay be distinguished as _gestes_ of the provinces, including the\r\n_Geste des Lorrains_, that of the North (_Raoul de Cambrai_), that\r\nof Burgundy, and others.[4] Among these may be placed the beautiful\r\ntale of _Amis et Amiles_, a glorification of friendship between man\r\nand man, which endures all trials and self-sacrifices. Other poems,\r\nagain, are unconnected with any of these cycles; and, indeed, the\r\ncyclic division is more a convenience of classification than a fact\r\nin the spontaneous development of this form of art. The entire period\r\nof the evolution of epic song extends from the tenth or eleventh to\r\nthe fifteenth century, or, we might say, from the _Chanson de Roland_\r\nto the _Chronique de Bertrand Duguesclin_. The eleventh century\r\nproduced the most admirable work; in the twelfth century the chansons\r\nare more numerous, but nothing was written of equal merit with the\r\nSong of Roland; after the death of Louis VII. (1180) the old epic\r\nmaterial was rehandled and beaten thin--the decadence was already\r\nin progress.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The epopee composed in Provencal, sung but not\r\ntranscribed, is wholly lost. The development of lyric poetry in the\r\nSouth probably checked the development of the epic.]\r\n\r\nThe style in which the _chansons de geste_ are written is something\r\ntraditional, something common to the people and to the time, rather\r\nthan characteristic of the individual authors. They show little of\r\nthe art of arranging or composing the matter so as to produce an unity\r\nof effect: the narrative straggles or condenses itself as if by\r\naccident; skill in transitions is unknown. The study of character\r\nis rude and elementary: a man is either heroic or dastard, loyal or\r\na traitor; wholly noble, or absolutely base. Yet certain types of\r\nmanhood and womanhood are presented with power and beauty. The feeling\r\nfor external nature, save in some traditional formulae, hardly\r\nappears. The passion for the marvellous is everywhere present: St.\r\nMaurice, St. George, and a shining company, mounted on white steeds,\r\nwill of a sudden bear down the hordes of the infidel; an angel stands\r\nglorious behind the throne of Charlemagne; or in narrative of Celtic\r\norigin angels may be mingled with fays. God, the great suzerain, to\r\nwhom even kings owe homage, rules over all; Jesus and Mary are watchful\r\nof the soldiers of the cross; Paradise receives the souls of the\r\nfaithful. As for earth, there is no land so gay or so dear as _la\r\ndouce France_. The Emperor is above all the servant and protector\r\nof the Church. As the influence of the great feudal lords increased,\r\nthey are magnified often at the expense of the monarchy; yet even\r\nwhen in high rebellion, they secretly feel the duty of loyalty. The\r\nrecurring poetic epithet and phrase of formula found in the _chansons\r\nde geste_ often indicate rather than veil a defect of imagination.\r\nEpisodes and adventures are endlessly repeated from poem to poem with\r\nvarying circumstances--the siege, the assault, the capture, the duel\r\nof Christian hero and Saracen giant, the Paynim princess amorous of\r\na fair French prisoner, the marriage, the massacre, and a score of\r\nother favourite incidents.\r\n\r\nThe popularity of the French epopee extended beyond France. Every\r\ncountry of Europe translated or imitated the _chansons de geste_.\r\nGermany made the fortunate choice of _Roland_ and _Aliscans_. In\r\nEngland two of the worst examples, _Fierabras_ and _Otinel_, were\r\nspecial favourites. In Norway the chansons were applied to the purpose\r\nof religious propaganda. Italy made the tales of Roland, Ogier, Renaud,\r\nher own. Meanwhile the national epopee declined in France; a breath\r\nof scepticism touched and withered the leafage and blossom of\r\nimagination; it even became possible to parody--as in _Audigier_--the\r\nheroic manner. The employment of rhyme in place of assonance, and of\r\nthe alexandrine in place of the decasyllabic line, encouraged what may\r\nbe called poetical padding. The influence of the Breton romances\r\ndiverted the _chansons de geste_ into ways of fantasy; \"We shall never\r\nknow,\" writes M. Leon Gautier, \"the harm which the Round Table has\r\ndone us.\" Finally, verse became a weariness, and was replaced by\r\nprose. The decline had progressed to a fall.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\nTHE EPIC OF ANTIQUITY\r\n\r\nLater to develop than the national epopee was that which formed the\r\ncycle of antiquity. Their romantic matter made the works of the\r\nGreco-Roman decadence even more attractive than the writings of the\r\ngreat classical authors to poets who would enter into rivalry with\r\nthe singers of the _chansons de geste_. These poems, which\r\nmediaevalise ancient literature--poems often of portentous\r\nlength--have been classified in three groups--epic romances,\r\nhistorical or pseudo-historical romances, and mythological tales,\r\nincluding the imitations of Ovid. The earliest in date of the first\r\ngroup (about 1150-1155) is the ROMANCE OF THEBES, the work of an\r\nunknown author, founded upon a compendium of the Thebaid of Statius,\r\npreceded by the story of OEdipus. It opened the way for the vast\r\nROMANCE OF TROY, written some ten years later, by Benoit de\r\nSainte-More. The chief sources of Benoit were versions, probably more\r\nor less augmented, of the famous records of the Trojan war, ascribed\r\nto the Phrygian Dares, an imaginary defender of the city, and the\r\nCretan Dictys, one of the besiegers. Episodes were added, in which,\r\non a slender suggestion, Benoit set his own inventive faculty to work,\r\nand among these by far the most interesting and admirable is the story\r\nof Troilus and Briseida, known better to us by her later name of\r\nCressida. Through Boccaccio's _Il Filostrato_ this tale reached our\r\nEnglish Chaucer, and through Chaucer it gave rise to the strange,\r\nhalf-heroic, half-satirical play of Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nAgain, ten years later, an unknown poet was adapting Virgil to the\r\ntaste of his contemporaries in his _Eneas_, where the courtship of\r\nthe Trojan hero and Lavinia is related in the chivalric manner. All\r\nthese poems are composed in the swift octosyllabic verse; the _Troy_\r\nextends to thirty thousand lines. While the names of the personages\r\nare classical, the spirit and life of the romances are wholly\r\nmediaeval: Troilus, and Hector, and AEneas are conceived as if knights\r\nof the Middle Ages; their wars and loves are those of gallant\r\nchevaliers. The _Romance of Julius Caesar_ (in alexandrine verse),\r\nthe work of a certain Jacot de Forest, writing in the second half\r\nof the thirteenth century, versifies, with some additions from the\r\nCommentaries of Caesar, an earlier prose translation by Jehan de Thuin\r\n(about 1240) of Lucan's Pharsalia--the oldest translation in prose\r\nof any secular work of antiquity. Caesar's passion for Cleopatra in\r\nthe Romance is the love prescribed to good knights by the amorous\r\ncode of the writer's day, and Cleopatra herself has borrowed something\r\nof the charm of Tristram's Iseult.\r\n\r\nIf _Julius Caesar_ may be styled historical, the ROMAN D'ALEXANDRE,\r\na poem of twenty thousand lines (to the form of which this romance\r\ngave its name--\"alexandrine\" verse), the work of Lambert le Tort and\r\nAlexandre de Bernay, can only be described as legendary. All--or\r\nnearly all--that was written during the Middle Ages in French on the\r\nsubject of Alexander may be traced back to Latin versions of a Greek\r\ncompilation, perhaps of the first century, ascribed to Callisthenes,\r\nthe companion of Alexander on his Asiatic expedition.[5] It is\r\nuncertain how much the _Alexandre_ may owe to a Provencal poem on\r\nthe same subject, written in the early years of the twelfth century,\r\nprobably by Alberic de Briancon, of which only a short fragment, but\r\nthat of high merit, has been preserved. From his birth, and his\r\neducation by Aristotle and the enchanter Nectanebus, to the division,\r\nas death approaches, of his empire between his twelve peers, the story\r\nof Alexander is a series of marvellous adventures; the imaginary\r\nwonders of the East, monstrous wild beasts, water-women,\r\nflower-maidens, Amazons, rain of fire, magic mountains, magic\r\nfountains, trees of the sun and of the moon, are introduced with a\r\nliberal hand. The hero is specially distinguished by the virtue of\r\nliberality; a jongleur who charms him by lays sung to the flute, is\r\nrewarded with the lordship of Tarsus, a worthy example for the\r\ntwelfth-century patrons of the poet. The romance had a resounding\r\nfame.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Not quite all, for certain borrowings were made from\r\nthe correspondence of Alexander with Dindimus, King of the Brahmans,\r\nand from the _Alexandri Magni iter ad Paradisum_.]\r\n\r\nOf classical poets, Ovid ranked next to Virgil in the esteem of the\r\nMiddle Ages. The mythology of paganism was sanctified by the\r\nassumption that it was an allegory of Christian mysteries, and thus\r\nthe stories might first be enjoyed by the imagination, and then be\r\nexpounded in their spiritual meaning. The _Metamorphoses_ supplied\r\nChretien de Troyes with the subject of his _Philomena_; other writers\r\ngracefully dealt with the tales of _Piramus_ and of _Narcissus_. But\r\nthe most important work founded upon Ovid was a versified translation\r\nof the _Metamorphoses_ (before 1305) by a Franciscan monk, Chretien\r\nLegouais de Sainte-Maure, with appended interpretations, scientific,\r\nhistorical, moral, or religious, of the mythological fables. Ovid's\r\n_Art of Love_, of which more than one rendering was made, aided in\r\nthe formation or development of the mediaeval theory of love and the\r\namorous casuistry founded upon that theory.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\nROMANCES OF LOVE AND COURTESY\r\n\r\nUnder the general title of the _Epopee courtoise_--the Epopee of\r\nCourtesy--may be grouped those romances which are either works of\r\npure imagination or of uncertain origin, or which lead us back to\r\nByzantine or to Celtic sources. They include some of the most\r\nbeautiful and original poems of the Middle Ages. Appearing first about\r\nthe opening of the twelfth century, later in date than the early\r\n_chansons de geste_, and contemporary with the courtly lyric poetry\r\nof love, they exhibit the chivalric spirit in a refined and graceful\r\naspect; their marvels are not gross wonders, but often surprises of\r\nbeauty; they are bright in colour, and varied in the play of life;\r\nthe passions which they interpret, and especially the passion of love,\r\nare felt with an exquisite delicacy and a knowledge of the workings\r\nof the heart. They move lightly in their rhymed or assonanced verse;\r\neven when they passed into the form of prose they retained something\r\nof their charm. Breton harpers wandering through France and England\r\nmade Celtic themes known through their _lais_; the fame of King Arthur\r\nwas spread abroad by these singers and by the _History_ of Geoffrey\r\nof Monmouth. French poets welcomed the new matter of romance, infused\r\ninto it their own chivalric spirit, made it a receptacle for their\r\nideals of gallantry, courtesy, honour, grace, and added their own\r\nbeautiful inventions. With the story of King Arthur was connected\r\nthat of the sacred vessel--the graal--in which Joseph of Arimathea\r\nat the cross had received the Saviour's blood. And thus the rude Breton\r\n_lais_ were elevated not only to a chivalric but to a religious\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe romances of Tristan may certainly be named as of Celtic origin.\r\nAbout 1150 an Anglo-Norman poet, BEROUL, brought together the\r\nscattered narrative of his adventures in a romance, of which a large\r\nfragment remains. The secret loves of Tristan and Iseut, their\r\nwoodland wanderings, their dangers and escapes, are related with fine\r\nimaginative sympathy; but in this version of the tale the fatal\r\nlove-philtre operates only for a period of three years; Iseut, with\r\nTristan's consent, returns to her husband, King Marc; and then a\r\nsecond passion is born in their hearts, a passion which is the\r\noffspring not of magic but of natural attraction, and at a critical\r\nmoment of peril the fragment closes. About twenty years later (1170)\r\nthe tale was again sung by an Anglo-Norman named THOMAS. Here--again\r\nin a fragment--we read of Tristan's marriage, a marriage only in name,\r\nto the white-handed Iseut of Brittany, his fidelity of heart to his\r\none first love, his mortal wound and deep desire to see the Queen\r\nof Cornwall, the device of the white or black sails to announce the\r\nresult of his entreaty that she should come, his deception, and the\r\ndeath of his true love upon her lover's corpse. Early in the thirteenth\r\ncentury was composed a long prose romance, often rehandled and\r\nexpanded, upon the same subject, in which Iseut and Tristan meet at\r\nthe last moment and die in a close embrace.\r\n\r\n_Le Chevrefeuille_ (The Honeysuckle), one of several _lais_ by a\r\ntwelfth-century poetess, MARIE, living in England, but a native of\r\nFrance, tells gracefully of an assignation of Tristan and Iseut, their\r\nmeeting in the forest, and their sorrowful farewell. Marie de France\r\nwrote with an exquisite sense of the generosities and delicacy of\r\nthe heart, and with a skill in narrative construction which was rare\r\namong the poets of her time. In _Les Deux Amants_, the manly pride\r\nof passion, which in a trial of strength declines the adventitious\r\naid of a reviving potion, is rewarded by the union in death of the\r\nlover and his beloved. In _Yonec_ and in _Lanval_ tales of love and\r\nchivalry are made beautiful by lore of fairyland, in which the element\r\nof wonder is subdued to beauty. But the most admirable poem by Marie\r\nde France is unquestionably her _Eliduc_. The Breton knight Eliduc\r\nis passionately loved by Guilliadon, the only daughter of the old\r\nKing of Exeter, on whose behalf he had waged battle. Her tokens of\r\naffection, girdle and ring, are received by Eliduc in silence; for,\r\nthough her passion is returned, he has left in Brittany, unknown to\r\nGuilliadon, a faithful wife. Very beautiful is the self-transcending\r\nlove of the wife, who restores her rival from seeming death, and\r\nherself retires into a convent. The lovers are wedded, and live in\r\ncharity to the poor, but with a trouble at the heart for the wrong\r\nthat they have done. In the end they part; Eliduc embraces the\r\nreligious life, and the two loving women are united as sisters in\r\nthe same abbey.\r\n\r\nWace, in his romance of the _Brut_ (1155), which renders into verse\r\nthe _Historia_ of Geoffrey of Monmouth, makes the earliest mention\r\nof the Round Table. Whether the Arthurian legends be of Celtic or\r\nof French origin--and the former seems probable--the French romances\r\nof King Arthur owe but the crude material to Celtic sources; they\r\nmay be said to begin with CHRETIEN DE TROYES, whose lost poem on\r\nTristan was composed about 1160. Between that date and 1175 he wrote\r\nhis _Erec et Enide_ (a tale known to us through Tennyson's idyll of\r\nGeraint and Enid, derived from the Welsh _Mabinogion_), _Cliges_,\r\n_Le Chevalier de la Charrette_, _Le Chevalier au Lion_, and _Perceval_.\r\nIn _Cliges_ the maidenhood of his beloved Fenice, wedded in form to\r\nthe Emperor of Constantinople, is guarded by a magic potion; like\r\nRomeo's Juliet, she sleeps in apparent death, but, happier than Juliet,\r\nshe recovers from her trance to fly with her lover to the court of\r\nArthur. The _Chevalier de la Charrette_, at first unknown by name,\r\nis discovered to be Lancelot, who, losing his horse, has condescended,\r\nin order that he may obtain sight of Queen Guenievre, and in passionate\r\ndisregard of the conventions of knighthood, to seat himself in a cart\r\nwhich a dwarf is leading. After gallant adventures on the Queen's\r\nbehalf, her indignant resentment of his unknightly conduct,\r\nestrangement, and rumours of death, he is at length restored to her\r\nfavour.[6] While _Perceval_ was still unfinished, Chretien de Troyes\r\ndied. It was continued by other poets, and through this romance the\r\nquest of the holy graal became a portion of the Arthurian cycle. A\r\n_Perceval_ by ROBERT DE BORON, who wrote in the early part of the\r\nthirteenth century, has been lost; but a prose redaction of the\r\nromance exists, which closes with the death of King Arthur. The great\r\n_Lancelot_ in prose--a vast compilation--(about 1220) reduces the\r\nvarious adventures of its hero and of other knights of the King to\r\ntheir definitive form; and here the achievement of the graal is\r\nassigned, not to Perceval, but to the saintly knight Sir Galaad;\r\nArthur is slain in combat with the revolter Mordret; and Lancelot\r\nand the Queen enter into the life of religion. Passion and piety are\r\nalike celebrated; the rude Celtic legends have been sanctified. The\r\nearlier history of the sacred vase was traced by Robert de Boron in\r\nhis _Joseph d'Arimathie_ (or the _Saint-Graal_), soon to be rehandled\r\nand developed in prose; and he it was who, in his _Merlin_--also\r\npresently converted into prose--on suggestions derived from Geoffrey\r\nof Monmouth, brought the great enchanter into Arthurian romance. By\r\nthe middle of the thirteenth century the cycle had received its full\r\ndevelopment. Towards the middle of the fourteenth century, in\r\n_Perceforest_, an attempt was made to connect the legend of Alexander\r\nthe Great with that of King Arthur.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Chretien de Troyes is the first poet to tell of the love\r\nof Lancelot for the Queen.]\r\n\r\nBeside the so-called Breton romances, the _Epopee courtoise_ may be\r\ntaken to include many poems of Greek, of Byzantine, or of uncertain\r\norigin, such as the _Roman de la Violette_, the tale of a wronged\r\nwife, having much in common with that novel of Boccaccio with which\r\nShakespeare's _Cymbeline_ is connected, the _Floire et\r\nBlanchefleur_; the _Partenopeus de Blois_, a kind of \"Cupid and\r\nPsyche\" story, with the parts of the lovers transposed, and others.\r\nIn the early years of the thirteenth century the prose romance\r\nrivalled in popularity the romance in verse. The exquisite\r\n_chante-fable_ of _Aucassin et Nicolette_, of the twelfth century,\r\nis partly in prose, partly in assonanced _laisses_ of seven-syllable\r\nverse. It is a story of the victory of love: the heir of Count Garin\r\nof Beaucaire is enamoured of a beautiful maiden of unknown birth,\r\npurchased from the Saracens, who proves to be daughter of the King\r\nof Carthage, and in the end the lovers are united. In one remarkable\r\npassage unusual sympathy is shown with the hard lot of the peasant,\r\nwhose trials and sufferings are contrasted with the lighter troubles\r\nof the aristocratic class.\r\n\r\nIn general the poems of the _Epopee courtoise_ exhibit much of the\r\nbrilliant external aspect of the life of chivalry as idealised by\r\nthe imagination; dramatic situations are ingeniously devised; the\r\nemotions of the chief actors are expounded and analysed, sometimes\r\nwith real delicacy; but in the conception of character, in the\r\nrecurring incidents, in the types of passion, in the creation of\r\nmarvel and surprise, a large conventional element is present. Love\r\nis independent of marriage, or rather the relation of wedlock excludes\r\nlove in the accepted sense of the word; the passion is almost\r\nnecessarily illegitimate, and it comes as if it were an irresistible\r\nfate; the first advance is often made by the woman; but, though at\r\nwar with the duty of wedlock, love is conceived as an ennobling\r\ninfluence, prompting the knight to all deeds of courage and\r\nself-sacrifice. Through the later translation of the Spanish _Amadis\r\ndes Gaules_, something of the spirit of the mediaeval romances was\r\ncarried into the chivalric and pastoral romances of the seventeenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\nLYRICAL POETRY--FABLES, AND RENARD THE FOX--FABLIAUX--THE ROMANCE\r\nOF THE ROSE\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\nLYRICAL POETRY\r\n\r\nLong before the date of any lyrical poems that have come down to us,\r\nsong and dance were a part of the life of the people of the North\r\nas well as of the South of France; religious festivals were celebrated\r\nwith a gaiety which had its mundane side; love and malicious sport\r\ndemanded an expression as well as pious joy. But in tracing the forms\r\nof lyrical verse anterior to the middle of the twelfth century, when\r\nthe troubadour influence from the South began to be felt, we must\r\nbe guided partly by conjecture, derived from the later poetry, in\r\nwhich--and especially in the refrains--earlier fragments have been\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\nThe common characteristic which distinguishes the earlier lyrics is\r\nthe presence in them of an objective element: they do not merely render\r\nan emotion; they contain something of a story, or they suggest a\r\nsituation. In this literature of sentiment, the singer or imagined\r\nsinger is commonly a woman. The _chanson d'histoire_ is also known\r\nas _chanson de toile_, for the songs were such as suited \"the spinsters\r\nand the knitters in the sun.\" Their inspiring motive was a girl's\r\njoy or grief in love; they lightly outline or suggest the facts of\r\na miniature drama of passion, and are aided by the repeated lyrical\r\ncry of a refrain. As yet, love was an affair for the woman; it was\r\nshe alone who made a confession of the heart. None of these poems\r\nare later than the close of the twelfth century. If the author be\r\nrepresented as actor or witness, the poem is rather a _chanson a\r\npersonnages_ than a _chanson d'histoire_; most frequently it is a\r\nwife who is supposed to utter to husband, or lover, or to the poet,\r\nher complaint of the grievous servitude of marriage. The _aube_ is,\r\nagain, a woman's song, uttered as a parting cry when the lark at\r\ndaybreak, or the watcher from his tower, warns her lover to depart.\r\nIn the _pastourelle_--a form much cultivated--a knight and a\r\nshepherdess meet; love proposals are made, and find a response\r\nfavourable or the reverse; witnesses or companions may be present,\r\nand take a part in the action. The _rondet_ is a dancing-song, in\r\nwhich the refrain corresponds with one of the movements of the dance;\r\na solo-singer is answered by the response of a chorus; in the progress\r\nof time the _rondet_ assumed the precise form of the modern triolet;\r\nthe theme was still love, at first treated seriously if not tragically,\r\nbut at a later time in a spirit of gaiety. It is conjectured that\r\nall these lyrical forms had their origin in the festivities of May,\r\nwhen the return of spring was celebrated by dances in which women\r\nalone took part, a survival from the pagan rites of Venus.\r\n\r\nThe _poesie courtoise_, moulded in form and inspired in its sentiment\r\nby the Provencal lyrics, lies within the compass of about one hundred\r\nand thirty years, from 1150 to 1280. The Crusade of 1147 served,\r\ndoubtless, as a point of meeting for men of the North and of the South;\r\nbut, apart from this, we may bear in mind the fact that the mediaeval\r\npoet wandered at will from country to country and from court to court.\r\nIn 1137, Louis VII. married Eleonore of Aquitaine, who was an ardent\r\nadmirer of the poetry of courtesy. Her daughters inherited her taste,\r\nand themselves became patronesses of literature at the courts of their\r\nhusbands, Henri de Champagne and Thibaut de Blois. From these courts,\r\nand that of Paris, this poetry of culture spread, and the earlier\r\nsingers were persons of royal or noble rank and birth. The chief period\r\nof its cultivation was probably from 1200 to 1240. During the\r\nhalf-century before its sudden cessation, while continuing to be a\r\nfashion in courts and high society, it reached the wealthy bourgeoisie\r\nof the North. At Arras, where Jacques Bretel and Adam de la Halle,\r\nthe hunchback, were eminent in song, it had its latest moments of\r\nsplendour.\r\n\r\nIt is essentially a poetry of the intellect and of the imagination,\r\ndealing with an elaborated theory of love; the simple and spontaneous\r\ncry of passion is rarely heard. According to the amorous doctrine,\r\nlove exists only between a married woman and the aspirant to her heart,\r\nand the art of love is regulated by a stringent code. Nothing can\r\nbe claimed by the lover as a right; the grace of his lady, who is\r\nplaced far above him, must be sought as a favour; for that favour\r\nhe must qualify himself by all knightly virtues, and chief among these,\r\nas the position requires, are the virtues of discretion and patience.\r\nHence the poet's ingenuities of adoration; hence often the monotony\r\nof artificial passion; hence, also, subtleties and curiosities of\r\nexpression, and sought-out delicacies of style. In the earlier\r\nchansons some outbreak of instinctive feeling may be occasionally\r\npresent; but, as the amorous metaphysics developed, what came to be\r\nadmired was the skill shown in manipulating a conventional sentiment;\r\nthe lady became an abstraction of exalted beauty, the lover an\r\ninterpreter of the theory of love; the most personal of passions lost\r\nthe character of individuality. Occasionally, as in the poems of the\r\nChatelain de Couci, of Conon de Bethune, of Thibaut de Champagne,\r\nand of Adam de la Halle, something personal to the writer may be\r\ndiscerned; but in general the poetry is that of a doctrine and of\r\na school.\r\n\r\nIn some instances the reputation of the lyrical trouvere was founded\r\nrather on his music than his verse. The metrical forms were various,\r\nand were gradually reduced to rule; the _ballette_, of Provencal\r\norigin, was a more elaborate _rondet_, consisting of stanzas and\r\nrefrain; the _estampie_ (_stampon_, to beat the ground with the foot)\r\nwas a dancing-song; the lyric _lai_, virtually identical with the\r\n_descort_, consisted of stanzas which varied in structure; the\r\n_motet_, a name originally applied to pieces of church music, was\r\nfreer in versification, and occasionally dealt with popular themes.\r\nAmong forms which cannot be included under the general title of\r\nchansons, are those in dialogue derived from the Provencal\r\nliterature; in the _tenson_ or _debat_ the two interlocutors put forth\r\ntheir opinions on what theme they may please; in the _jeu parti_ one\r\nof the imagined disputants proposes two contrary solutions of some\r\npoetical or amorous question, and defends whichever solution his\r\nassociate refuses to accept; the earliest _jeu parti_, attributed\r\nto Gace Brule and Count Geoffroi of Brittany, belongs to the second\r\nhalf of the twelfth century. The _serventois_ were historical poems,\r\nand among them songs of the crusades, or moral, or religious, or\r\nsatirical pieces, directed against woman and the worship of woman.\r\nTo these various species we should add the songs in honour of the\r\nsaints, the sorrows of the Virgin uttered at the foot of the cross,\r\nand other devout lyrics which lie outside the _poesie courtoise_.\r\nWith the close of the thirteenth century this fashion of artificial\r\nlove-lyric ceased: a change passed over the modes of thought and\r\nfeeling in aristocratic society, and other forms took the place of\r\nthose found in the _poesie courtoise_.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\nFABLES, AND RENARD THE FOX\r\n\r\nThe desire of ecclesiastical writers in the Middle Ages to give\r\nprominence to that part of classical literature which seemed best\r\nsuited to the purpose of edification caused the fables of Phaedrus\r\nand Avianus to be regarded with special honour. Various renderings\r\nfrom the thirteenth century onwards were made under the title of\r\n_Isopets_,[1] a name appropriated to collections of fables whether\r\nderived from AEsop or from other sources. The twelfth-century fables\r\nin verse of Marie de France, founded on an English collection, include\r\napologues derived not only from classical authors but from the tales\r\nof popular tradition. A great collection made about 1450 by\r\nSteinhoewel, a physician of Ulm, was translated into French, and\r\nbecame the chief source of later collections, thus appearing in the\r\nremote ancestry of the work of La Fontaine. The aesthetic value of\r\nthe mediaeval fables, including those of Marie de France, is small;\r\nthe didactic intention was strong, the literary art was feeble.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The earlier \"Romulus\" was the name of the supposed author\r\nof the fables of Phaedrus, while that of Phaedrus was still unknown.]\r\n\r\nIt is far otherwise with the famous beast-epic, the ROMAN DE RENARD.\r\nThe cycle consists of many parts or \"branches\" connected by a common\r\ntheme; originating and obscurely developed in the North, in Picardy,\r\nin Normandy, and the Isle of France, it suddenly appeared in\r\nliterature in the middle of the twelfth century, and continued to\r\nreceive additions and variations during nearly two hundred years.\r\nThe spirit of the _Renard_ poems is essentially bourgeois; the heroes\r\nof the _chansons de geste_ achieve their wondrous deeds by strength\r\nand valour; Renard the fox is powerful by skill and cunning; the\r\ngreater beasts--his chief enemy the wolf, and others--are no match\r\nfor his ingenuity and endless resources; but he is powerless against\r\nsmaller creatures, the cock, the crow, the sparrow. The names of the\r\npersonages are either significant names, such as Noble, the lion,\r\nand Chanticleer, the cock, or proper names, such as Isengrin, the\r\nwolf, Bruno, the bear, Tibert, the cat, Bernard, the ass; and as\r\ncertain of these proper names are found in the eastern district, it\r\nhas been conjectured that a poet of Lotharingia in the tenth century\r\nfirst told in Latin the wars of fox and wolf, and that through\r\ntranslations the epic matter, derived originally from popular\r\ntradition, reached the trouveres of the North. While in a certain\r\ndegree typical figures, the beasts are at the same time individual;\r\nRenard is not the representative merely of a species; he is Renard,\r\nan individual, with a personality of his own; Isengrin is not merely\r\na wolf, he is the particular wolf Isengrin; each is an epic individual,\r\nheroic and undying. Classical fable remotely exerted an influence\r\non certain branches of the Romance; but the vital substance of the\r\nepic is derived from the stores of popular tradition in which material\r\nfrom all quarters--the North of Europe and the Eastern world--had\r\nbeen gradually fused. In the artistic treatment of such material the\r\nchief difficulty lies in preserving a just measure between the\r\nbeast-character and the imported element of humanity. Little by\r\nlittle the anthropomorphic features were developed at the expense\r\nof verisimilitude; the beast forms became a mere masquerade; the\r\nromances were converted into a satire, and the satire lost rather\r\nthan gained by the inefficient disguise.\r\n\r\nThe earliest branches of the cycle have reached us only in a\r\nfragmentary way, but they can be in part reconstructed from the Latin\r\n_Isengrinus_ of Nivard of Ghent (about 1150), and from the German\r\n_Reinhart Fuchs_, a rendering from the French by an Alsatian, Henri\r\nle Glichezare (about 1180). The wars of Renard and Isengrin are here\r\nsung, and the failure of Renard's trickeries against the lesser\r\ncreatures; the spirit of these early branches is one of frank gaiety,\r\nuntroubled by a didactic or satirical intention. In the branches of\r\nthe second period the parody of human society is apparent; some of\r\nthe episodes are fatiguing in their details; some are intolerably\r\ngross, but the poem known as the Branch of the Judgment is masterly--an\r\nironical comedy, in which, without sacrifice of the primitive\r\ncharacter of the beast-epic, the spirit of mediaeval life is\r\ntransported into the animal world. Isengrin, the accuser of Renard\r\nbefore King Noble and his court, is for a moment worsted; the fox\r\nis vindicated, when suddenly enters a funeral cortege--Chanticleer\r\nand his four wives bear upon a litter the dead body of one of their\r\nfamily, the victim of Renard's wiles. The prayers for the dead are\r\nrecited, the burial is celebrated with due honour, and Renard is\r\nsummoned to justice; lie heaped upon lie will not save him; at last\r\nhe humbles himself with pious repentance, and promising to seek God's\r\npardon over-sea, is permitted in his pilgrim's habit to quit the court.\r\nIt is this Judgment of Renard which formed the basis of the _Reineke\r\nFuchs_, known to us through the modernisation of Goethe.\r\n\r\nFrom the date of the Branch of the Judgment the Renard Romances\r\ndeclined. The Judgment was imitated by inferior hands, and the beasts\r\nwere more and more nearly transformed to men; the spirit of gaiety\r\nwas replaced by seriousness or gloom; Renard ceased to be a\r\nlight-footed and ingenious rogue; he became a type of human fraud\r\nand cruelty; whatever in society was false and base and merciless\r\nbecame a form of \"renardie,\" and by \"renardie\" the whole world seemed\r\nto be ruled. Such is the temper expressed in _Le Couronnement Renard_,\r\nwritten in Flanders soon after 1250, a satire directed chiefly against\r\nthe mendicant orders, in which the fox, turned friar for a season,\r\nascends the throne. _Renard le Nouveau_, the work of a poet of Lille,\r\nJacquemart Gelee, nearly half a century later, represents again the\r\ntriumph of the spirit of evil; although far inferior in execution\r\nto the _Judgment_, it had remarkable success, to which the allegory,\r\nwearying to a modern reader, no doubt contributed at a time when\r\nallegory was a delight. The last of the Renard romances, _Renard le\r\nContrefait_, was composed at Troyes before 1328, by an ecclesiastic\r\nwho had renounced his profession and turned to trade. In his leisure\r\nhours he spun, in discipleship to Jean de Meun, his interminable poem,\r\nwhich is less a romance than an encyclopaedia of all the knowledge\r\nand all the opinions of the author. This latest _Renard_ has a value\r\nakin to that of the second part of _Le Roman de la Rose_; it is a\r\npresentation of the ideas and manners of the time by one who freely\r\ncriticised and mocked the powers that be, both secular and sacred,\r\nand who was in sympathy with a certain movement or tendency towards\r\nsocial, political, and intellectual reform.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\nFABLIAUX\r\n\r\nThe name _fabliaux_ is applied to short versified tales, comic in\r\ncharacter, and intended rather for recitation than for song. Out of\r\na far larger number about one hundred and fifty have survived. The\r\nearliest--_Richeut_--is of the year 1159. From the middle of the\r\ntwelfth century, together with the heroic or sentimental poetry of\r\nfeudalism, we find this bourgeois poetry of realistic observation;\r\nand even in the _chansons de geste_, in occasional comic episodes,\r\nsomething may be seen which is in close kinship with the fabliaux.\r\nMany brief humorous stories, having much in common under their various\r\ndisguises, exist as part of the tradition of many lands and peoples.\r\nThe theory which traces the French fabliaux to Indian originals is\r\nunproved, and indeed is unnecessary. The East, doubtless,\r\ncontributed its quota to the common stock, but so did other quarters\r\nof the globe; such tales are ubiquitous and are undying, only the\r\nparticular form which they assume being determined by local\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe fabliaux, as we can study them, belong especially to the north\r\nand north-east of France, and they continued to be put forth by their\r\nrhymers until about 1340, the close of the twelfth and the beginning\r\nof the thirteenth century being the period of their greatest\r\npopularity. Simple and obvious jests sufficed to raise a laugh among\r\nfolk disposed to good humour; by degrees something of art and skill\r\nwas attained. The misfortunes of husbands supplied an inexhaustible\r\nstore of merriment; if woman and the love of woman were idealised\r\nin the romances, the fabliaux took their revenge, and exhibited her\r\nas the pretty traitress of a shameless comedy. If religion was\r\nhonoured in the age of faith, the bourgeois spirit found matter of\r\nmirth in the adventures of dissolute priests and self-indulgent monks.\r\nNot a few of the fabliaux are cynically gross--ribald but not\r\nvoluptuous. To literary distinction they made small pretence. It\r\nsufficed if the tale ran easily in the current speech, thrown into\r\nrhyming octosyllables; but brevity, frankness, natural movement are\r\nno slight or common merits in mediaeval poetry, and something of the\r\nsocial life of the time is mirrored in these humorous narratives.\r\n\r\nTo regard them as a satire of class against class, inspired by\r\nindignation, is to misconceive their true character; they are rather\r\nminiature comedies or caricatures, in which every class in turn\r\nprovides material for mirth. It may, however, be said that with the\r\nwriters of the fabliaux to hold woman in scorn is almost an article\r\nof faith. Among these writers a few persons of secular rank or\r\ndignified churchmen occasionally appeared; but what we may call the\r\nprofessional rhymers and reciters were the humbler jongleurs\r\naddressing a bourgeois audience--degraded clerics, unfrocked monks,\r\nwandering students, who led a bohemian life of gaiety alternating\r\nwith misery. In the early part of the fourteenth century these errant\r\njongleurs ceased to be esteemed; the great lord attached a minstrel\r\nto his household, and poetry grew more dignified, more elaborate in\r\nits forms, more edifying in its intention, and in its dignity grew\r\ntoo often dull. Still for a time fabliaux were written; but the age\r\nof the jongleurs was over. _Virelais_, _rondeaux_, _ballades_,\r\n_chants royaux_ were the newer fashion; and the old versified tale\r\nof mirth and ribaldry was by the middle of the century a thing of\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\nTHE ROMANCE OF THE ROSE\r\n\r\nThe most extraordinary production in verse of the thirteenth century\r\nis undoubtedly _Le Roman de la Rose_. It is indeed no single\r\nachievement, but two very remarkable poems, written at two different\r\nperiods, by two authors whose characters and gifts were not only alien,\r\nbut opposed--two poems which reflect two different conditions of\r\nsociety. Of its twenty-two thousand octosyllabic lines, upwards of\r\nfour thousand are the work of GUILLAUME DE LORRIS; the remainder is\r\nthe work of a later writer, JEAN DE MEUN.\r\n\r\nLorris is a little town situated between Orleans and Montargis. Here,\r\nabout the year 1200, the earlier poet was born. He was a scholar,\r\nat least as far as knowledge of Latin extends, and learned above all\r\nin the lore of love. He died young, probably before 1230, and during\r\nthe five years that preceded his death the first part of _Le Roman\r\nde la Rose_ was composed. Its subject is an allegorised tale of love,\r\nhis own or imagined, transferred to the realm of dreams. The writer\r\nwould fain win the heart of his beloved, and at the same time he would\r\ninstruct all amorous spirits in the art of love. He is twenty years\r\nof age, in the May-morn of youth. He has beheld his beautiful lady,\r\nand been charmed by her fairness, her grace, her courtesy; she has\r\nreceived him with gentleness, but when he declares his love she grows\r\nalarmed. He gains at last the kiss which tells of her affection; but\r\nher parents intervening, throw obstacles between the lovers. Such,\r\ndivested of ornament, allegory, and personification, is the theme\r\nof the poem.\r\n\r\nTo pluck the rose in the garden of delight is to win the maiden; her\r\nfears, her virgin modesty and pride, her kindness, her pity, are the\r\ncompany of friends or foes by whom the rose is surrounded; and to\r\nharmonise the real and the ideal, all the incidents are placed in\r\nthe setting of a dream. Wandering one spring morning by the\r\nriver-banks, the dreamer finds himself outside the walls of a fair\r\norchard, owned by Deduit (Pleasure), of which the portress is Oiseuse\r\n(Idleness); on the walls are painted figures of Hatred, Envy, Sadness,\r\nOld Age, Poverty, and other evil powers; but unterrified by these,\r\nhe enters, and finds a company of dancers on the turf, among whom\r\nis Beauty, led by the god of Love. Surrounded by a thorny hedge is\r\nthe rosebud on which all his desire now centres. He is wounded by\r\nthe arrows of Love, does homage to the god, and learns his commandments\r\nand the evils and the gains of love. Invited by Bel-Accueil, the son\r\nof Courtoisie, to approach the rose, he is driven back by Danger and\r\nhis companions, the guardians of the blossom. Raison descends from\r\na tower and discourses against the service of Love; Ami offers his\r\nconsolations; at length the lover is again admitted to the flowery\r\nprecinct, finds his rosebud half unclosed, and obtains the joy of\r\na kiss. But Jealousy raises an unscalable wall around the rose; the\r\nserviceable Bel-Accueil is imprisoned, and with a long lament of the\r\nlover, the poem (line 4068) closes.\r\n\r\nDid Guillaume de Lorris ever complete his poem, or did he die while\r\nit was still but half composed? We may conjecture that it wanted little\r\nto reach some denouement--perhaps the fulfilment of the lover's\r\nhopes; and it is not impossible that a lost fragment actually brought\r\nthe love-tale to its issue. But even if the story remained without\r\nan end, we possess in Guillaume's poem a complete mediaeval Art of\r\nLove; and if the amorous metaphysics are sometimes cold, conventional,\r\nor laboured, we have gracious allegories, pieces of brilliant\r\ndescription, vivid personifications, and something of ingenious\r\nanalysis of human passion. Nevertheless the work of this Middle-Age\r\ndisciple of Ovid and of Chretien de Troyes owes more than half its\r\ncelebrity to the continuation, conceived in an entirely opposite\r\nspirit, by his successor, Jean de Meun.\r\n\r\nThe contrast is striking: Guillaume de Lorris was a refined and\r\ngraceful exponent of the conventional doctrine of love, a seemly\r\ncelebrant in the cult of woman, an ingenious decorator of accepted\r\nideas; Jean de Meun was a passionate and positive spirit, an ardent\r\nspeculator in social, political, and scientific questions, one who\r\ncared nothing for amorous subtleties, and held woman in scorn.\r\nGuillaume addressed an aristocratic audience, imbued with the\r\nsentiments of chivalry; Jean was a bourgeois, eager to instruct, to\r\narouse, to inflame his fellows in a multitude of matters which\r\nconcerned the welfare of their lives. He was little concerned for\r\nthe lover and his rose, but was deeply interested in the condition\r\nof society, the corruptions of religion, the advance of knowledge.\r\nHe turned from ideals which seemed spurious to reason and to nature;\r\nhe had read widely in Latin literature, and found much that suited\r\nhis mood and mind in Boethius' _De Consolatione Philosophiae_ and\r\nin the _De Planctu Naturae_ of the \"universal doctor\" of the twelfth\r\ncentury, Alain de Lille, from each of which he conveyed freely into\r\nhis poem. Of his life we know little; Jean Clopinel was born at Meun\r\non the Loire about the year 1240; he died before the close of 1305;\r\nhis continuation of Guillaume's _Roman_ was made about 1270. His later\r\npoems, a _Testament_, in which he warned and exhorted his\r\ncontemporaries of every class, the _Codicille_, which incited to\r\nalmsgiving, and his numerous translations, prove the unabated energy\r\nof his mind in his elder years.\r\n\r\nThe rose is plucked by the lover in the end; but lover and rose are\r\nalmost forgotten in Jean's zeal in setting forth his views of life,\r\nand in forming an encyclopaedia of the knowledge of his time. Reason\r\ndiscourses on the dangers of passion, commends friendship or\r\nuniversal philanthropy as wiser than love, warns against the\r\ninstability of fortune and the deceits of riches, and sets charity\r\nhigh above justice; if love be commendable, it is as the device of\r\nnature for the continuation of the species. The way to win woman and\r\nto keep her loyalty is now the unhappy way of squandered largess;\r\nformerly it was not so in the golden age of equality, before private\r\nproperty was known, when all men held in common the goods of the earth,\r\nand robber kings were evils of the future. The god of Love and his\r\nbarons, with the hypocrite monk Faux-Semblant--a bitter satirist of\r\nthe mendicant orders--besiege the tower in which Bel-Accueil is\r\nimprisoned, and by force and fraud an entrance is effected. The old\r\nbeldame, who watches over the captive, is corrupted by promises and\r\ngifts, and frankly exposes her own iniquities and those of her sex.\r\nWar is waged against the guardians of the rose, Venus, sworn enemy\r\nof chastity, aiding the assailants. Nature, devoted to the\r\ncontinuance of the race, mourns over the violation of her laws by\r\nman, unburdens herself of all her scientific lore in a confession\r\nto her chaplain Genius, and sends him forth to encourage the lover's\r\nparty with a bold discourse against the crime of virginity. The\r\ntriumph of the lover closes the poem.\r\n\r\nThe graceful design of the earlier poet is disregarded; the love-story\r\nbecomes a mere frame for setting forth the views of Jean de Meun,\r\nhis criticism of the chivalric ideal, his satire upon the monkish\r\nvices, his revolutionary notions respecting property and government,\r\nhis advanced opinions in science, his frank realism as to the\r\nrelations of man and woman. He possesses all the learning of his time,\r\nand an accomplished judgment in the literature which he had studied.\r\nHe is a powerful satirist, and passages of narrative and description\r\nshow that he had a poet's feeling for beauty; he handles the language\r\nwith the strength and skill of a master. On the other hand, he lacks\r\nall sense of proportion, and cannot shape an imaginative plan; his\r\nprolixity wearies the reader, and it cannot be denied that as a moral\r\nreformer he sometimes topples into immorality. The success of the\r\npoem was extraordinary, and extended far beyond France. It was\r\nattacked and defended, and up to the time of Ronsard its influence\r\non the progress of literature--encouraging, as it did, to excess the\r\nart of allegory and personification--if less than has commonly been\r\nalleged, was unquestionably important.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\nDIDACTIC LITERATURE--SERMONS--HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\nDIDACTIC LITERATURE\r\n\r\nThe didactic literature, moral and scientific, of the Middle Ages\r\nis abundant, and possesses much curious interest, but it is seldom\r\noriginal in substance, and seldom valuable from the point of view\r\nof literary style. In great part it is translated or derived from\r\nLatin sources. The writers were often clerks or laymen who had turned\r\nfrom the vanities of youth--fabliau or romance--and now aimed at\r\nedification or instruction. Science in the hands of the clergy must\r\nneeds be spiritualised and moralised; there were sermons to be found\r\nin stones, pious allegories in beast and bird; mystic meanings in\r\nthe alphabet, in grammar, in the chase, in the tourney, in the game\r\nof chess. Ovid and Virgil were sanctified to religious uses. The\r\nearliest versified Bestiary, which is also a Volucrary, a Herbary,\r\nand a Lapidary, that of Philippe de Thaon (before 1135), is versified\r\nfrom the Latin _Physiologus_, itself a translation from the work of\r\nan Alexandrian Greek of the second century. In its symbolic zoology\r\nthe lion and the pelican are emblems of Christ; the unicorn is God;\r\nthe crocodile is the devil; the stones \"turrobolen,\" which blaze when\r\nthey approach each other, are representative of man and woman. A\r\n_Bestiaire d'Amour_ was written by Richard de Fournival, in which\r\nthe emblems serve for the interpretation of human love. A Lapidary,\r\nwith a medical--not a moral--purpose, by Marbode, Bishop of Rennes,\r\nwas translated more than once into French, and had, indeed, an\r\nEuropean fame.\r\n\r\nBestiaries and Lapidaries form parts of the vast encyclopaedias,\r\nnumerous in the thirteenth century, which were known by such names\r\nas _Image du Monde_, _Mappe-monde_, _Miroir du Monde_. Of these\r\nencyclopaedias, the only one which has a literary interest is the\r\n_Tresor_ (1265), by Dante's master, Brunetto Latini, who wrote in\r\nFrench in preference to his native Italian. In it science escapes\r\nnot wholly from fantasy and myth, but at least from the allegorising\r\nspirit; his ethics and rhetoric are derived from Latin originals;\r\nhis politics are his own. The _Somme des Vices et des Vertus_, compiled\r\nin 1279 by Friar Lorens, is a well-composed _tresor_ of religion and\r\nmorals. Part of its contents has become familiar to us through the\r\nCanterbury discourse of Chaucer's parson. The moral experience of\r\na man of the world is summed up in the prose treatise on \"The Four\r\nAges of Man,\" by Philippe de Novare, chancellor of Cyprus. With this\r\nedifying work may be grouped the so-called _Chastiements_, counsels\r\non education and conduct, designed for readers in general or for some\r\nspecial class--women, children, persons of knightly or of humble\r\nrank; studies of the virtues of chivalry, the rules of courtesy and\r\nof manners.[1] Other writings, the _Etats du Monde_, present a view\r\nof the various classes of society from a standpoint ethical, religious,\r\nor satirical, with warnings and exhortations, which commonly\r\nconclude with a vision of the last judgment and the pains of hell.\r\nWith such a scene of terror closes the interesting _Poeme Moral_ of\r\nEtienne de Fougeres, in which the life of St. Moses, the converted\r\nrobber, serves as an example to monks, and that of the converted Thais\r\nto ladies who are proud of their beauty. Its temper of moderation\r\ncontrasts with the bitter satire in the _Bible_ by Guiot de Provins,\r\nand with many shorter satirical pieces directed against clerical\r\nvices or the infirmities of woman. The _Besant de Dieu_, by Guillaume\r\nle Clerc, a Norman poet (1227), preaches in verse, with eloquence\r\nand imaginative power, the love of God and contempt of the world from\r\nthe texts of two Scripture parables--that of the Talents and that\r\nof the Bridegroom; Guillaume anticipates the approaching end of the\r\nworld, foreshown by wars, pestilence, and famine, condemns in the\r\nspirit of Christian charity the persecution of the Albigenses, and\r\nmourns over the shame that has befallen the Holy Sepulchre.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Two works of the fourteenth century, interesting in the\r\nhistory of manners and ideas, may here be mentioned--the _Livre du\r\nChevalier de la Tour-Landry_ (1372), composed for the instruction\r\nof the writer's daughters, and the _Menagier de Paris_, a treatise\r\non domestic economy, written by a Parisian bourgeois for the use of\r\nhis young wife.]\r\n\r\nAmong the preacher poets of the thirteenth century the most\r\ninteresting personally is the minstrel RUTEBEUF, who towards the\r\nclose of his gay though ragged life turned to serious thoughts, and\r\nexpressed his penitent feelings with penetrating power. Rutebeuf,\r\nindeed--the Villon of his age--deployed his vivid and ardent powers\r\nin many directions, as a writer of song and satire, of allegory, of\r\nfabliaux, of drama. On each and all he impressed his own personality;\r\nthe lyric note, imaginative fire, colour, melody, these were gifts\r\nthat compensated the poet's poverty, his conjugal miseries, his lost\r\neye, his faithless friends, his swarming adversaries. The\r\npersonification of vices and virtues, occasional in the _Besant_ and\r\nother poems, becomes a system in the _Songe d'Enfer_, a pilgrim's\r\nprogress to hell, and the _Voie de Paradis_, a pilgrim's progress\r\nto heaven, by Raoul de Houdan (after 1200). The _Pelerinage de la\r\nVie Humaine_--another \"way to Paradise\"; the _Pelerinage de\r\nl'Ame_--a vision of hell, purgatory, and heaven; and the _Pelerinage\r\nde Jesus-Christ_--a narrative of the Saviour's life, by Guillaume\r\nde Digulleville (fourteenth century), have been imagined by some to\r\nhave been among the sources of Bunyan's allegories. Human life may\r\nbe represented in one aspect as a pilgrimage; in another it is a\r\nknightly encounter; there is a great strife between the powers of\r\ngood and evil; in _Le Tornoiement Antecrist_, by Huon de Meri, Jesus\r\nand the Knights of the Cross, among whom, besides St. Michael, St.\r\nGabriel, Confession, Chastity, and Alms, are Arthur, Launcelot, and\r\nGawain, contend against Antichrist and the infernal barons--Jupiter,\r\nNeptune, Beelzebub, and a crowd of allegorical personages. But the\r\nbattles and _debats_ of a chivalric age were not only religious; there\r\nare battles of wine and water, battles of fast and feasting, battles\r\nof the seven arts. A disputation between the body and the soul, a\r\nfavourite subject for separate treatment by mediaeval poets, is found\r\nalso in one of the many sermons in verse; the _Debat des Trois Morts\r\net des Trois Vifs_ recalls the subject of the memorable painting in\r\nthe Campo Santo at Pisa.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\nSERMONS\r\n\r\nThe Latin sermons of the Middle Ages were countless; but it is not\r\nuntil Gerson and the close of the fourteenth century that we find\r\na series of discourses by a known preacher written and pronounced\r\nin French. It is maintained that these Latin sermons, though prepared\r\nin the language of the Church, were delivered, when addressed to lay\r\naudiences, in the vernacular, and that those composite sermons in\r\nthe macaronic style, that is, partly in French, partly in Latin, which\r\nappear in the thirteenth century and are frequent in the fifteenth,\r\nwere the work of reporters or redactors among the auditory. On the\r\nother hand, it is argued that both Latin and French sermons were\r\npronounced as each might seem suitable, before the laity, and that\r\nthe macaronic style was actually practised in the pulpit. Perhaps\r\nwe may accept the opinion that the short and simple homilies designed\r\nfor the people, little esteemed as compositions, were rarely thought\r\nworthy of preservation in a Latin form; those discourses which remain\r\nto us, if occasionally used before an unlearned audience, seem to\r\nhave been specially intended for clerkly hearers. The sermons of St.\r\nBernard, which have been preserved in Latin and in a French\r\ntranslation of the thirteenth century, were certainly not his\r\neloquent popular improvisations; they are doctrinal, with crude or\r\ncurious allegorisings of Holy Scripture. Those of Maurice de Sully,\r\nArchbishop of Paris, probably also translated from the Latin, are\r\nsimpler in manner and more practical in their teaching; but in these\r\ncharacteristics they stand apart from the other sermons of the twelfth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the mendicant orders, Franciscans and Dominicans,\r\nbegan their labours that preaching, as preserved to us, was truly\r\nlaicised and popularised. During the thirteenth century the work of\r\nthe pulpit came to be conceived as an art which could be taught;\r\ncollections of anecdotes and illustrations--_exempla_--for the\r\nenlivening of sermons, manuals for the use of preachers were formed;\r\nrules and precepts were set forth; themes for popular discourse were\r\nproposed and enlarged upon, until at length original thought and\r\ninvention ceased; the preacher's art was turned into an easy trade.\r\nThe effort to be popular often resulted in pulpit buffoonery. When\r\nGERSON preached at court or to the people towards the close of the\r\nfourteenth century, gravely exhorting high and low to practical\r\nduties, with tender or passionate appeals to religious feeling, his\r\nsermons were noble exceptions to the common practice. And the descent\r\nfrom Gerson to even his more eminent successors is swift and steep.\r\nThe orators of the pulpit varied their discourse from burlesque mirth\r\nor bitter invective to gross terrors, in which death and judgment,\r\nSatan and hell-fire were largely displayed. The sermons of Michel\r\nMenot and Olivier Maillard, sometimes eloquent in their censure of\r\nsin, sometimes trivial or grotesque, sometimes pedantic in their\r\nexhibition of learning, have at least an historical value in\r\npresenting an image of social life in the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nA word must be said of the humanism which preceded the Renaissance.\r\nScholars and students there were in France two hundred years before\r\nthe days of Erasmus and of Bude; but they were not scholars inspired\r\nby genius, and they contented themselves with the task of translators,\r\nundertaken chiefly with a didactic purpose. If they failed to\r\ncomprehend the spirit of antiquity, none the less they did something\r\ntowards quickening the mind of their own time and rendering the French\r\nlanguage less inadequate to the intellectual needs of a later age.\r\nAll that was then known of Livy's history was rendered into French\r\nin 1356 by the friend of Petrarch, Pierre Bercuire. On the suggestion\r\nof Charles V., Nicole Oresme translated from the Latin the Ethics,\r\nPolitics, and Economics of Aristotle. It was to please the king that\r\nthe aged Raoul de Presles prepared his version of St. Augustine's\r\n_De Civitate Dei_, and Denis Foulechat, with very scanty scholarship,\r\nset himself to render the _Polycraticus_ of John of Salisbury. The\r\ndukes of Bourbon, of Berry, of Burgundy, were also patrons of letters\r\nand encouraged their translators. We cannot say how far this movement\r\nof scholarship might have progressed, if external conditions had\r\nfavoured its development. In Jean de Montreuil, secretary of Charles\r\nVI., the devoted student of Cicero, Virgil, and Terence, we have an\r\nexample of the true humanist before the Renaissance. But the seeming\r\ndawn was a deceptive aurora; the early humanism of France was clouded\r\nand lost in the tempests of the Hundred Years' War.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\nHISTORY\r\n\r\nWhile the mediaeval historians, compilers, and abbreviators from\r\nrecords of the past laboured under all the disadvantages of an age\r\ndeficient in the critical spirit, and produced works of little value\r\neither for their substance or their literary style, the chroniclers,\r\nwho told the story of their own times, Villehardouin, Joinville,\r\nFroissart, Commines, and others, have bequeathed to us, in living\r\npictures or sagacious studies of events and their causes, some of\r\nthe chief treasures of the past. History at first, as composed for\r\nreaders who knew no Latin, was comprised in those _chansons de geste_\r\nwhich happened to deal with matter that was not wholly--or almost\r\nwholly--the creation of fancy. Narrative poems treating of\r\ncontemporary events came into existence with the Crusades, but of\r\nthese the earliest have not survived, and we possess only rehandlings\r\nof their matter in the style of romance. What happened in France might\r\nbe supposed to be known to persons of intelligence; what happened\r\nin the East was new and strange. But England, like the East, was\r\nforeign soil, and the Anglo-Norman trouveres of the eleventh and\r\ntwelfth centuries busied themselves with copious narratives in rhyme,\r\nsuch as Gaimar's _Estorie des Engles_ (1151), Wace's _Brut_ (1155)\r\nand his _Roman de Rou_, which, if of small literary importance, remain\r\nas monuments in the history of the language. The murder of Becket\r\ncalled forth the admirable life of the saint by Garnier de\r\nPont-Sainte-Maxence, founded upon original investigations; Henry\r\nII.'s conquest of Ireland was related by an anonymous writer; his\r\nvictories over the Scotch (1173-1174) were strikingly described by\r\nJordan Fantosme. But by far the most remarkable piece of versified\r\nhistory of this period, remarkable alike for its historical interest\r\nand its literary merit, is the _Vie de Guillaume le Marechal_--William,\r\nEarl of Pembroke, guardian of Henry III.--a poem of nearly twenty\r\nthousand octosyllabic lines by an unknown writer, discovered by M.\r\nPaul Meyer in the library of Sir Thomas Phillipps. \"The masterpiece\r\nof Anglo-Norman historiography,\" writes M. Langlois, \"is assuredly\r\nthis anonymous poem, so long forgotten, and henceforth classic.\"\r\n\r\nProse, however, in due time proved itself to be the fitting medium\r\nfor historical narrative, and verse was given over to the\r\nextravagances of fantasy. Compilations from the Latin, translations\r\nfrom the pseudo-Turpin, from Geoffrey of Monmouth, from Sallust,\r\nSuetonius, and Caesar were succeeded by original record and testimony.\r\nGEOFFROY DE VILLEHARDOUIN, born between 1150 and 1164, Marshal of\r\nChampagne in 1191, was appointed eight years later to negotiate with\r\nthe Venetians for the transport of the Crusaders to the East. He was\r\nprobably a chief agent in the intrigue which diverted the fourth\r\nCrusade from its original destination--the Holy Land--to the assault\r\nupon Constantinople. In the events which followed he had a prominent\r\npart; before the close of 1213 Villehardouin was dead. During his\r\nlast years he dictated the unfinished Memoirs known as the _Conquete\r\nde Constantinople_, which relate the story of his life from 1198 to\r\n1207. Villehardouin is the first chronicler who impresses his own\r\npersonality on what he wrote: a brave leader, skilful in resource,\r\nhe was by no means an enthusiast possessed by the more extravagant\r\nideas of chivalry; much more was he a politician and diplomatist,\r\nwith material interests well in view; not, indeed, devoid of a certain\r\nimaginative wonder at the marvels of the East; not without his moments\r\nof ardour and excitement; deeply impressed with the feeling of feudal\r\nloyalty, the sense of the bond between the suzerain and his vassal;\r\ndeeply conscious of the need of discipline in great adventures;\r\nkeeping in general a cool head, which could calculate the sum of profit\r\nand loss.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Villehardouin knew too much of affairs, and was\r\ntoo experienced a man of the world to be quite frank as a historian:\r\nwe can hardly believe, as he would have us, that the diversion of\r\nthe crusading host from its professed objects was unpremeditated;\r\nwe can perceive that he composes his narrative so as to form an\r\napology; his recital has been justly described as, in part at least,\r\n\"un memoire justificatif.\" Nevertheless, there are passages, such\r\nas that which describes the first view of Constantinople, where\r\nVillehardouin's feelings seize upon his imagination, and, as it were,\r\noverpower him. In general he writes with a grave simplicity, sometimes\r\nwith baldness, disdaining ornament, little sensible to colour or\r\ngrace of style; but by virtue of his clear intelligence and his real\r\ngrasp of facts his chronicle acquires a certain literary dignity,\r\nand when his words become vivid we know that it is because he had\r\nseen with inquisitive eyes and felt with genuine ardour. Happily for\r\nstudents of history, while Villehardouin presents the views of an\r\naristocrat and a diplomatist, the incidents of the same extraordinary\r\nadventure can be seen, as they struck a simple soldier, in the record\r\nof Robert de Clari, which may serve as a complement and a counterpoise\r\nto the chronicle of his more illustrious contemporary. The unfinished\r\n_Histoire de l'Empereur Henri_, which carries on the narrative of\r\nevents for some years subsequent to those related by Villehardouin,\r\nthe work of Henri de Valenciennes, is a prose redaction of what had\r\noriginally formed a _chanson de geste_.\r\n\r\nThe versified chronicle or history in the thirteenth century declined\r\namong Anglo-Norman writers, but was continued in Flanders and in\r\nFrance. Prose translations and adaptations of Latin chronicles,\r\nancient and modern, were numerous, but the literary value of many\r\nof these is slight. In the Abbey of Saint-Denis a corpus of national\r\nhistory in Latin had for a long while been in process of formation.\r\nUtilising this corpus and the works from which it was constructed,\r\none of the monks of the Abbey--perhaps a certain Primat--compiled,\r\nin the second half of the century, a History of France in the\r\nvernacular--the _Grandes Chroniques de Saint-Denis_--with which\r\nlater additions were from time to time incorporated, until under\r\nCharles V. the _Grandes Chroniques de France_ attained their\r\ndefinitive form.[2] Far more interesting as a literary composition\r\nis the little work known as _Recits d'un Menestrel de Reims_ (1260),\r\na lively, graceful, and often dramatic collection of traditions,\r\nanecdotes, dialogues, made rather for the purposes of popular\r\nentertainment than of formal instruction, and expressing the ideas\r\nof the middle classes on men and things. Forgotten during several\r\ncenturies, it remains to us as one of the happiest records of the\r\nmediaeval spirit.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The _Chroniques_ were continued by lay writers to the\r\naccession of Louis XI.]\r\n\r\nBut among the prose narratives to which the thirteenth century gave\r\nbirth, the _Histoire de Saint Louis_, by JEAN DE JOINVILLE, stands\r\npre-eminent. Joinville, born about 1224, possessed of such literary\r\nculture as could be gained at the Court of Thibaut IV. of Champagne,\r\nbecame a favoured companion of the chivalric and saintly Louis during\r\nhis six years' Crusade from 1248 to 1254. The memory of the King\r\nremained the most precious possession of his follower's elder years.\r\nIt is probable that soon after 1272 Joinville prepared an\r\nautobiographic fragment, dealing with that period of his youth which\r\nhad been his age of adventure. When he was nearly eighty, Jeanne of\r\nNavarre, wife of Philippe le Bel, invited the old seneschal to put\r\non record the holy words and good deeds of Saint Louis. Joinville\r\nwillingly acceded to the request, and incorporating the fragment of\r\nautobiography, in which the writer appeared in close connection with\r\nhis King, he had probably almost completed his work at the date of\r\nQueen Jeanne's death (April 2, 1305); to her son, afterwards Louis\r\nX., it was dedicated. His purpose was to recite the pious words and\r\nset forth the Christian virtues of the royal Saint in one book of\r\nthe History, and to relate his chivalric actions in the other; but\r\nJoinville had not the art of construction, he suffered from the\r\nfeebleness of old age, and he could not perfectly accomplish his\r\ndesign; in 1317 Joinville died. Deriving some of his materials from\r\nother memoirs of the King, especially those by Geoffroy de Beaulieu\r\nand Guillaume de Nangis, he drew mainly upon his own recollections.\r\nUnhappily the most authoritative manuscripts of the _Histoire de\r\nSaint Louis_ have been lost; we possess none earlier than the close\r\nof the fourteenth century; but by the learning and skill of a modern\r\neditor the text has been substantially established.\r\n\r\nWe must not expect from Joinville precision of chronology or\r\nexactitude in the details of military operations. His recollections\r\ncrowd upon him; he does not marshal them by power of intellect, but\r\nabandons himself to the delights of memory. He is a frank, amiable,\r\nspirited talker, who has much to tell; he succeeds in giving us two\r\nadmirable portraits--his own and that of the King; and unconsciously\r\nhe conveys into his narrative both the chivalric spirit of his time,\r\nand a sense of those prosaic realities which tempered the ideals of\r\nchivalry. What his eyes had rested on lives in his memory, with all\r\nits picturesque features, all its lines and colours, undimmed by time;\r\nand his curious eyes had been open to things great and small. He\r\nappears as a brave soldier, but, he confesses, capable of mortal fear;\r\nsincerely devout, but not made for martyrdom; zealous for his master's\r\ncause, but not naturally a chaser of rainbow dreams; one who enjoys\r\ngood cheer, who prefers his wine unallayed with water, who loves\r\nsplendid attire, who thinks longingly of his pleasant chateau, and\r\nthe children awaiting his return; one who will decline future\r\ncrusading, and who believes that a man of station may serve God well\r\nby remaining in his own fields among his humble dependants. But\r\nJoinville felt deeply the attraction of a nature more under the\r\ncontrol of high, ideal motives than was his own; he would not himself\r\nwash the feet of the poor; he would rather commit thirty mortal sins\r\nthan be a leper; but a kingly saint may touch heights of piety which\r\nare unattainable by himself. And, at the same time, he makes us feel\r\nthat Louis is not the less a man because he is a saint. Certain human\r\ninfirmities of temper are his; yet his magnanimity, his sense of\r\njustice, his ardent devotion, his charity, his pure self-surrender\r\nare made so sensible to us as we read the record of Joinville that\r\nwe are willing to subscribe to the sentence of Voltaire: \"It is not\r\ngiven to man to carry virtue to a higher point.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the fourteenth century the higher spirit of feudalism\r\ndeclined; the old faith and the old chivalry were suffering a decay;\r\nthe bourgeoisie grew in power and sought for instruction; it was an\r\nage of prose, in which learning was passing to the laity, or was\r\nadapted to their uses. Yet, while the inner life of chivalry failed\r\nday by day, and self-interest took the place of heroic self-surrender,\r\nthe external pomp and decoration of the feudal world became more\r\nbrilliant than ever. War was a trade practised from motives of vulgar\r\ncupidity; but it was adorned with splendour, and had a show of\r\ngallantry. The presenter in literature of this glittering spectacle\r\nis the historian JEAN FROISSART. Born in 1338, at Valenciennes, of\r\nbourgeois parents, Froissart, at the age of twenty-two, a\r\ndisappointed lover, a tonsured clerk, and already a poet, journeyed\r\nto London, with his manuscript on the battle of Poitiers as an offering\r\nto his countrywoman, Queen Philippa of Hainault. For nearly five years\r\nhe was the _ditteur_ of the Queen, a sharer in the life of the court,\r\nbut attracted before all else to those \"ancient knights and squires\r\nwho had taken part in feats of arms, and could speak of them rightly.\"\r\nHis patroness encouraged Froissart's historical inquiries. In the\r\n_Chroniques_ of Jean le Bel, canon of Liege, he found material ready\r\nto his hand, and freely appropriated it in many of his most admirable\r\npages; but he also travelled much through England and Scotland, noting\r\neverything that impressed his imagination, and gathering with\r\ndelight the testimony of those who had themselves been actors in the\r\nevents of the past quarter of a century. He accompanied the Black\r\nPrince to Aquitaine, and, later, the Duke of Clarence to Milan. The\r\ndeath of Queen Philippa, in 1369, was ruinous to his prospects. For\r\na time he supported himself as a trader in his native place. Then\r\nother patrons, kinsfolk of the Queen, came to his aid. The first\r\nrevised redaction of the first book of his Chronicles was his chief\r\noccupation while cure of Lestinnes; it is a record of events from\r\n1325 to the death of Edward III., and its brilliant narrative of events\r\nstill recent or contemporary insured its popularity with\r\naristocratic readers. Under the influence of Queen Philippa's\r\nbrother-in-law, Robert of Namur, it is English in its sympathies and\r\nadmirations. Unhappily Froissart was afterwards moved by his patron,\r\nGui de Blois, to rehandle the book in the French interest; and once\r\nagain in his old age his work was recast with a view to effacing the\r\nlarge debt which he owed to his predecessor, Jean le Bel. The first\r\nredaction is, however, that which won and retained the general favour.\r\nIf his patron induced Froissart to wrong his earlier work, he made\r\namends, for it is to Gui de Blois that we owe the last three books\r\nof the history, which bring the tale of events down to the\r\nassassination of Richard II. Still the cure of Lestinnes and the canon\r\nof Chimai pursued his early method of travel--to the court of Gaston,\r\nCount of Foix, to Flanders, to England--ever eager in his\r\ninterrogation of witnesses. It is believed that he lived to the close\r\nof 1404, but the date of his death is uncertain.\r\n\r\nFroissart as a poet wrote gracefully in the conventional modes of\r\nhis time. His vast romance _Meliador_, to which Wenceslas, Duke of\r\nBrabant, contributed the lyric part--famous in its day, long lost\r\nand recently recovered--is a construction of external marvels and\r\nsplendours which lacks the inner life of imaginative faith. But as\r\na brilliant scene-painter Froissart the chronicler is unsurpassed.\r\nHis chronology, even his topography, cannot be trusted as exact; he\r\nis credulous rather than critical; he does not always test or control\r\nthe statements of his informants; he is misled by their prejudices\r\nand passions; he views all things from the aristocratic standpoint;\r\nthe life of the common people does not interest him; he has no sense\r\nof their wrongs, and little pity for their sufferings; he does not\r\nstudy the deeper causes of events; he is almost incapable of\r\nreflection; he has little historical sagacity; he accepts\r\nappearances without caring to interpret their meanings. But what a\r\nvivid picture he presents of the external aspects of fourteenth-century\r\nlife! What a joy he has in adventure! What an eye for the picturesque!\r\nWhat movement, what colour! What a dramatic--or should we say\r\ntheatrical?--feeling for life and action! Much, indeed, of the\r\nvividness of Froissart's narrative may be due to the eye-witnesses\r\nfrom whom he had obtained information; but genius was needed to\r\npreserve--perhaps to enhance--the animation of their recitals. If he\r\nunderstood his own age imperfectly, he depicted its outward appearance\r\nwith incomparable skill; and though his moral sense was shallow, and\r\nhis knowledge of character far from profound, he painted portraits\r\nwhich live in the imagination of his readers.\r\n\r\nThe fifteenth century is rich in historical writings of every\r\nkind--compilations of general history, domestic chronicles, such as\r\nthe _Livre des Faits du bon Messire Jean le Maingre, dit Bouciquaut_,\r\nofficial chronicles both of the French and Burgundian parties,\r\njournals and memoirs. The Burgundian Enguerrand de Monstrelet was\r\na lesser Froissart, faithful, laborious, a transcriber of documents,\r\nbut without his predecessor's genius. On the French side the so-called\r\n_Chronique Scandaleuse_, by Jean de Roye, a Parisian of the time of\r\nLouis XI., to some extent redeems the mediocrity of the writers of\r\nhis party.\r\n\r\nIn PHILIPPE DE COMMINES we meet the last chronicler of the Middle\r\nAges, and the first of modern historians. Born about 1445, in Flanders,\r\nof the family of Van den Clyte, Commines, whose parents died early,\r\nreceived a scanty education; but if he knew no Latin, his acquaintance\r\nwith modern languages served him well. At first in the service of\r\nCharles the Bold, in 1472 he passed over to the cause of Louis XI.\r\nHis treason to the Duke may be almost described as inevitable; for\r\nCommines could not attach himself to violence and folly, and was\r\nnaturally drawn to the counsels of civil prudence. The bargain was\r\nas profitable to his new master as to the servant. On the King's death\r\ncame a reverse of fortune for Commines: for eight months he was cramped\r\nin the iron cage; during two years he remained a prisoner in the\r\nConciergerie (1487-89), with enforced leisure to think of the\r\npreparation of his _Memoires_.[3] Again the sunshine of royal favour\r\nreturned; he followed Charles VIII. to Italy, and was engaged in\r\ndiplomatic service at Venice. In 1511 he died.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Books I.-VI., written 1488-94; Books VII., VIII.,\r\nwritten 1494-95.]\r\n\r\nThe _Memoires_ of Commines were composed as a body of material for\r\na projected history of Louis XI. by Archbishop Angelo Cato; the writer,\r\napparently in all sincerity, hoped that his unlearned French might\r\nthus be translated into Latin, the language of scholars; happily we\r\npossess the Memoirs as they left their author's mind. And, though\r\nCommines rather hides than thrusts to view his own personality, every\r\npage betrays the presence of a remarkable intellect. He was no artist\r\neither in imaginative design or literary execution; he was before\r\nall else a thinker, a student of political phenomena, a searcher after\r\nthe causes of events, an analyst of motives, a psychologist of\r\nindividual character and of the temper of peoples, and, after a\r\nfashion, a moralist in his interpretation of history. He cared little,\r\nor not at all, for the coloured surface of life; his chief concern\r\nis to seize the master motive by which men and events are ruled, to\r\ncomprehend the secret springs of action. He is aristocratic in his\r\npolitics, monarchical, an advocate for the centralisation of power;\r\nbut he would have the monarch enlightened, constitutional, and\r\npacific. He values solid gains more than showy magnificence; and\r\nknowing the use of astuteness, he knows also the importance of good\r\nfaith. He has a sense of the balance of European power, and anticipates\r\nMontesquieu in his theory of the influence of climates on peoples.\r\nThere is something of pity, something of irony, in the view which\r\nhe takes of the joyless lot of the great ones of the earth. Having\r\nascertained how few of the combinations of events can be controlled\r\nby the wisest calculation, he takes refuge in a faith in Providence;\r\nhe finds God necessary to explain this entangled world; and yet his\r\nmorality is in great part that which tries good and evil by the test\r\nof success. By the intensity of his thought Commines sometimes becomes\r\nstriking in his expression; occasionally he rises to a grave\r\neloquence; occasionally his irony is touched by a bitter humour. But\r\nin general he writes with little sentiment and no sense of beauty,\r\nunder the control of a dry and circumspect intelligence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\nLATEST MEDIAEVAL POETS--THE DRAMA\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\nLATEST MEDIAEVAL POETS\r\n\r\nThe fourteenth and fifteenth centuries form a period of transition\r\nfrom the true Middle Ages to the Renaissance. The national epopee\r\nwas dead; the Arthurian tales were rehandled in prose; under the\r\ninfluence of the _Roman de la Rose_, allegory was highly popular,\r\nand Jean de Meun had shown how it could be applied to the\r\nsecularisation of learning; the middle classes were seeking for\r\ninstruction. In lyric poetry the free creative spirit had declined,\r\nbut the technique of verse was elaborated and reduced to rule; ballade,\r\nchant royal, lai, virelai, rondeau were the established forms, and\r\nlyric verse was often used for matter of a didactic, moral, or\r\nsatirical tendency. Even Ovid was tediously moralised (_c_. 1300)\r\nin some seventy thousand lines by Chretien Legouais. Literary\r\nsocieties or _puys_[1] were instituted, which maintained the rules\r\nof art, and awarded crowns to successful competitors in poetry; a\r\nformal ingenuity replaced lyrical inspiration; poetry accepted\r\nproudly the name of \"rhetoric.\" At the same time there is gain in\r\none respect--the poets no longer conceal their own personality behind\r\ntheir work: they instruct, edify, moralise, express their real or\r\nsimulated passions in their own persons; if their art is mechanical,\r\nyet through it we make some acquaintance with the men and manners\r\nof the age.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Puy_, mountain, eminence, signifying the elevated seat\r\nof the judges of the artistic competition.]\r\n\r\nThe chief exponent of the new art of poetry was GUILLAUME DE MACHAUT.\r\nBorn about 1300, he served as secretary to the King of Bohemia, who\r\nfell at Crecy. He enjoyed a tranquil old age in his province of\r\nChampagne, cultivating verse and music with the applause of his\r\ncontemporaries. The ingenuities of gallantry are deployed at length\r\nin his _Jugement du Roi de Navarre_; he relates with dull prolixity\r\nthe history of his patron, Pierre de Lusignan, King of Cyprus, in\r\nhis _Prise d'Alexandrie_; the _Voir dit_ relates in varying verse\r\nand prose the course of his sexagenarian love for a maiden in her\r\nteens, Peronne d'Armentieres, who gratified her coquetry with an old\r\npoet's adoration, and then wedded his rival.\r\n\r\nIn the forms of his verse EUSTACHE DESCHAMPS, also a native of\r\nChampagne (_c_. 1345-1405), was a disciple of Machaut: if he was not\r\na poet, he at least interests a reader by rhymed journals of his own\r\nlife and the life of his time, written in the spirit of an honest\r\nbourgeois, whom disappointed personal hopes and public misfortune\r\nhad early embittered. Eighty thousand lines, twelve hundred ballades,\r\nnearly two hundred rondeaux, a vast unfinished satire on woman, the\r\n_Miroir de Mariage_, fatigued even his own age, and the official court\r\npoet of France outlived his fame. He sings of love in the conventional\r\nmodes; his historical poems, celebrating events of the day, have\r\ninterest by virtue of their matter; as a moralist in verse he deplores\r\nthe corruption of high and low, the cupidity in Church and State,\r\nand, above all, applies his wit to expose the vices and infirmities\r\nof women. The earliest Poetic in French--_L'art de dictier et de fere\r\nchancons, balades, virelais, et rondeaulx_ (1392)--is the work of\r\nEustache Deschamps, in which the poet, by no means himself a master\r\nof harmonies, insists on the prime importance of harmony in verse.\r\n\r\nThe exhaustion of the mediaeval sources of inspiration is still more\r\napparent in the fifteenth-century successors of Deschamps. But\r\nalready something of the reviving influence of Italian culture makes\r\nitself felt. CHRISTINE DE PISAN, Italian by her parentage and place\r\nof birth (_c_. 1363), was left a widow with three young children at\r\nthe age of twenty-five. Her sorrow, uttered in verse, is a genuine\r\nlyric cry; but when in her poverty she practised authorship as a trade,\r\nwhile she wins our respect as a mother, the poetess is too often at\r\nonce facile and pedantic. Christine was zealous in maintaining the\r\nhonour of her sex against the injuries of Jean de Meun; in her prose\r\n_Cite des Dames_ she celebrates the virtues and heroism of women,\r\nwith examples from ancient and modern times; in the _Livre des Trois\r\nVertus_ she instructs women in their duties. When advanced in years,\r\nand sheltered in the cloister, she sang her swan-song in honour of\r\nJoan of Arc. Admirable in every relation of life, a patriot and a\r\nscholar, she only needed one thing--genius--to be a poet of\r\ndistinction.\r\n\r\nA legend relates that the Dauphiness, Margaret of Scotland, kissed\r\nthe lips of a sleeper who was the ugliest man in France, because from\r\nthat \"precious mouth\" had issued so many \"good words and virtuous\r\nsayings.\" The sleeper was Christine's poetical successor, ALAIN\r\nCHARTIER. His fame was great, and as a writer of prose he must be\r\nremembered with honour, both for his patriotic ardour, and for the\r\nharmonious eloquence (modelled on classical examples) in which that\r\nardour found expression. His first work, the _Livre des Quatre Dames_,\r\nis in verse: four ladies lament their husbands slain, captured, lost,\r\nor fugitive and dishonoured, at Agincourt. Many of his other poems\r\nwere composed as a distraction from the public troubles of the time;\r\nthe title of one, widely celebrated in its own day, _La Belle Dame\r\nsans Mercy_, has obtained a new meaning of romance through its\r\nappropriation by Keats. In 1422 he wrote his prose _Quadrilogue\r\nInvectif_, in which suffering France implores the nobles, the clergy,\r\nthe people to show some pity for her miserable state. If Froissart\r\nhad not discerned the evils of the feudal system, they were patent\r\nto the eyes of Alain Chartier. His _Livre de l'Esperance_, where the\r\noratorical prose is interspersed with lyric verse, spares neither\r\nthe clergy nor the frivolous and dissolute gentry, who forget their\r\nduty to their country in wanton self-indulgence; yet his last word,\r\nwritten at the moment when Joan of Arc was leaving the pastures for\r\nbattle, is one of hope. His _Curial_ (_The Courtier_) is a satire\r\non the vices of the court by one who had acquaintance with its\r\ncorruption. The large, harmonious phrase of Alain Chartier was new\r\nto French prose, and is hardly heard again until the seventeenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe last grace and refinements of chivalric society blossom in the\r\npoetry of CHARLES D'ORLEANS, \"la grace exquise des choses freles.\"\r\nHe was born in 1391, son of Louis, Duke of Orleans, and an Italian\r\nmother, Valentine of Milan. Married at fifteen to the widow of Richard\r\nII. of England, he lost his father by assassination, his mother by\r\nthe stroke of grief, his wife in childbirth. From the battlefield\r\nof Agincourt he passed to England, where he remained a prisoner,\r\nclosely guarded, for twenty-five years. It seems as if events should\r\nhave made him a tragic poet; but for Charles d'Orleans poetry was\r\nthe brightness or the consolation of his exile. His elder years at\r\nthe little court of Blois were a season of delicate gaiety, when he\r\nenjoyed the recreations of age, and smiled at the passions of youth.\r\nHe died in 1465. Neither depth of reflection nor masculine power of\r\nfeeling finds expression in his verse; he does not contribute new\r\nideas to poetry, nor invent new forms, but he rendered the old material\r\nand made the accepted moulds of verse charming by a gracious\r\npersonality and an exquisite sense of art. Ballade, rondeau, chanson,\r\neach is manipulated with the skill of a goldsmith setting his gems.\r\nHe sings of the beauty of woman, the lighter joys of love, the pleasure\r\nof springtide, the song of the birds, the gliding of a stream or a\r\ncloud; or, as an elder man, he mocks with amiable irony the fatiguing\r\nardours of young hearts. When St. Valentine's day comes round, his\r\ngood physician \"Nonchaloir\" advises him to abstain from choosing a\r\nmistress, and recommends an easy pillow. The influence of Charles\r\nd'Orleans on French poetry was slight; it was not until 1734 that\r\nhis forgotten poems were brought to light.\r\n\r\nIn the close of the mediaeval period, when old things were passing\r\naway and new things were as yet unborn, the minds of men inclined\r\nto fill the void with mockery and satire. Martin Lefranc (_c_. 1410-61)\r\nin his _Champion des Dames_--a poem of twenty-four thousand lines, in\r\nwhich there is much spirit and vigour of versification--balances one\r\nagainst another the censure and the praise of women. Coquillard, with\r\nhis railleries assuming legal forms and phrases, laughs at love and\r\nlovers, or at the _Droits Nouveaux_ of a happy time when licence had\r\nbecome the general law. Henri Baude, a realist in his keen observation,\r\nsatirises with direct, incisive force, the manners and morals of his\r\nage. Martial d'Auvergne (_c_. 1433-1508), chronicling events in his\r\n_Vigiles de Charles VII._, a poem written according to the scheme of\r\nthe liturgical Vigils, is eloquent in his expression of the wrongs of\r\nthe poor, and in his condemnation of the abuses of power and station.\r\nIf the _Amant rendu Cordelier_ be his, he too appears among those who\r\njest at the follies and extravagance of love. His prose _Arrets\r\nd'Amour_ are discussions and decisions of the imaginary court which\r\ndetermines questions of gallantry.\r\n\r\nAmid such mockery of life and love, the horror of death was ever\r\npresent to the mind of a generation from which hope and faith seemed\r\nto fail; it was the time of the _Danse Macabre_; the skeleton became\r\na grim humourist satirising human existence, and verses written for\r\nthe dance of women were ascribed in the manuscript which preserves\r\nthem to Martial d'Auvergne.\r\n\r\nPassion and the idea of death mingle with a power at once realistic\r\nand romantic in the poetry of FRANCOIS VILLON. He was born in poverty,\r\nan obscure child of the capital, in 1430 or 1431; he adopted the name\r\nof his early protector, Villon; obtained as a poor scholar his\r\nbachelor's degree in 1449, and three years later became a _maitre\r\nes arts_; but already he was a master of arts less creditable than\r\nthose of the University. In 1455 Villon--or should we call him\r\nMonterbier, Montcorbier, Corbueil, Desloges, Mouton (aliases\r\nconvenient for vagabondage)?--quarrelled with a priest, and killed\r\nhis adversary; he was condemned to death, and cheered his spirits\r\nwith the piteous ballade for those about to swing to the kites and\r\nthe crows; but the capital punishment was commuted to banishment.\r\nNext winter, stung by the infidelity and insults of a woman to whom\r\nhe had abandoned himself, he fled, perhaps to Angers, bidding his\r\nfriends a jesting farewell in the bequests of his _Petit Testament_.\r\nBetrayed by one who claimed him as an associate in robbery, Villon\r\nis lost to view for three years; and when we rediscover him in 1461,\r\nit is as a prisoner, whose six months' fare has been bread and water\r\nin his cell at Meun-sur-Loire. The entry of Louis XI., recently\r\nconsecrated king, freed the unhappy captive. Before the year closed\r\nhe had composed his capital work, the _Grand Testament_, and proved\r\nhimself the most original poet of his century. And then Villon\r\ndisappears; whether he died soon after, whether he lived for half\r\na score of years, we do not know.\r\n\r\nWhile he handles with masterly ease certain of the fifteenth-century\r\nforms of verse--in particular the ballade--Villon is a modern in his\r\nabandonment of the traditional machinery of the imagination, its\r\nconvention of allegories and abstractions, and those half-realised\r\nmoralisings which were repeated from writer to writer; he is modern\r\nin the intensity of a personal quality which is impressed upon his\r\nwork, in the complexity of his feelings, passing from mirth to despair,\r\nfrom beauty to horror, from cynical grossness to gracious memories\r\nor aspirations; he is modern in his passion for the real, and in those\r\ngleams of ideal light which are suddenly dashed across the vulgar\r\nsurroundings of his sorry existence. While he flings out his scorn\r\nand indignation against those whom he regarded as his ill-users, or\r\ncries against the injuries of fortune, or laments his miserable past,\r\nhe yet is a passionate lover of life; and shadowing beauty and youth\r\nand love and life, he is constantly aware of the imminent and\r\ninexorable tyranny of death. The ideas which he expresses are few\r\nand simple--ideas common to all men; but they take a special colour\r\nfrom his own feelings and experiences, and he renders them with a\r\npoignancy which is his own, with a melancholy gaiety and a desperate\r\nimaginative sincerity. His figure is so interesting in itself--that\r\nof the _enfant perdu_ of genius--and so typical of a class, that the\r\ntemptation to create a Villon legend is great; but to magnify his\r\nproportions to those of the highest poets is to do him wrong. His\r\npassionate intensity within a limited range is unsurpassed; but\r\nVillon wanted sanity, and he wanted breadth.\r\n\r\nIn his direct inspiration from life, co-operating with an admirable\r\nskill and science in literary form, Villon stands alone. For\r\nothers--Georges Chastelain, Meschinot, Molinet, Cretin--poetry was\r\na cumbrous form of rhetoric, regulated by the rules of those arts\r\nof poetry which during the fifteenth century appeared at not\r\ninfrequent intervals. The _grands rhetoriqueurs_ with their\r\ncomplicated measures, their pedantic diction, their effete allegory,\r\ntheir points and puerilities, testify to the exhaustion of the Middle\r\nAges, and to the need of new creative forces for the birth of a living\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nThere is life, however, in the work of one remarkable prose-writer\r\nof the time--ANTOINE DE LA SALLE. His residence in Rome (1422) had\r\nmade him acquainted with the tales of the Italian _novellieri_; he\r\nwas a friend of the learned and witty Poggio; Rene of Anjou entrusted\r\nto him the education of his son; when advanced in years he became\r\nthe author certainly of one masterpiece, probably of three. If he\r\nwas the writer of the _Quinze Joies de Mariage_, he knew how to mask\r\na rare power of cynical observation under a smiling face: the Church\r\nhad celebrated the fifteen joys of the Blessed Virgin; he would\r\nironically depict the fifteen afflictions of wedded life, in scenes\r\nfinely studied from the domestic interior. How far the _Cent Nouvelles\r\nnouvelles_ are to be ascribed to him is doubtful; it is certain that\r\nthese licentious tales reproduce, with a new skill in narrative prose,\r\nthe spirit of indecorous mirth in their Italian models. The _Petit\r\nJehan de Saintre_ is certainly the work of Antoine de la Salle; the\r\nirony of a realist, endowed with subtlety and grace, conducts the\r\nreader through chivalric exaltations to vulgar disillusion. The\r\nwriter was not insensible to the charm of the ideals of the past,\r\nbut he presents them only in the end to cover them with disgrace.\r\nThe anonymous farce of _Pathelin_, and the _Chronique de petit Jehan\r\nde Saintre_, are perhaps the most instructive documents which we\r\npossess with respect to the moral temper of the close of the Middle\r\nAges; and there have been critics who have ventured to ascribe both\r\nworks to the same hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\nTHE DRAMA\r\n\r\nThe mediaeval drama in France, though of early origin, attained its\r\nfull development only when the Middle Ages were approaching their\r\nterm; its popularity continued during the first half of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. It waited for a public; with the growth of industry, the\r\nuprising of the middle classes, it secured its audience, and in some\r\nmeasure filled the blank created by the disappearance of the _chansons\r\nde geste_. The survivals of the drama of the twelfth and thirteenth\r\ncenturies are few; the stream, as we know, was flowing, but it ran\r\nunderground.\r\n\r\nThe religious drama had its origin in the liturgical offices of the\r\nChurch. At Christmas and at Easter the birth and resurrection of the\r\nSaviour were dramatically recited to the people by the clergy, within\r\nthe consecrated building, in Latin paraphrases of the sacred text;\r\nbut, as yet, neither Jesus nor His mother appeared as actors in the\r\ndrama. By degrees the vernacular encroached upon the Latin and\r\ndisplaced it; the scene passed from the church to the public place\r\nor street; the action developed; and the actors were priests supported\r\nby lay-folk, or were lay-folk alone.\r\n\r\nThe oldest surviving drama written in French (but with interspersed\r\nliturgical sentences of Latin) is of the twelfth century--the\r\n_Representation d'Adam_: the fall of man, and the first great crime\r\nwhich followed--the death of Abel--are succeeded by the procession\r\nof Messianic prophets. It was enacted outside the church, and the\r\nspectators were alarmed or diverted by demons who darted to and fro\r\namidst the crowd. Of the thirteenth century, only two religious pieces\r\nremain. Jean Bodel, of Arras, was the author of _Saint Nicholas_.\r\nThe poet, himself about to assume the cross, exhibits a handful of\r\nCrusaders in combat with the Mussulmans; all but one, a supplicant\r\nof the saint, die gloriously, with angelic applause and pity;\r\nwhereupon the feelings of the audience are relieved by the mirth and\r\nquarrels of drinkers in a tavern, who would rob St. Nicholas of the\r\ntreasure entrusted to his safeguard; miracles, and general\r\nconversion of the infidels, conclude the drama. The miracle of\r\n_Theophile_, the ambitious priest who pawned his soul to Satan, and\r\nthrough our Lady's intercession recovered his written compact, is\r\nby the trouvere Rutebeuf. These are scanty relics of a hundred years;\r\nyet their literary value outweighs that of the forty-two _Miracles\r\nde Notre Dame_ of the century which followed--rude pieces, often\r\ntrivial, often absurd in their incidents, with mystic extravagance\r\nsanctifying their vulgar realism. They formed, with two exceptions,\r\nthe dramatic repertory of some mediaeval _puy_, an association\r\nhalf-literary, half-religious, devoted to the Virgin's honour; their\r\nrhymed octosyllabic verse--the special dramatic form--at times\r\nborders upon prose. One drama, and only one, of the fourteenth century,\r\nchooses another heroine than our Lady--the _Histoire de Griselidis_,\r\nwhich presents, with pathos and intermingling mirth, those marvels\r\nof wifely patience celebrated for other lands by Boccaccio, by\r\nPetrarch, and by Chaucer.\r\n\r\nThe fifteenth-century Mystery exhibits the culmination of the\r\nmediaeval sacred drama. The word _mystere_,[2] first appropriated\r\nto tableaux vivants, is applied to dramatic performances in the royal\r\nprivilege which in 1402 conferred upon the association known as the\r\n_Confrerie de la Passion_ the right of performing the plays of our\r\nRedemption. Before this date the Blessed Virgin and the infant Jesus\r\nhad appeared upon the scene. The Mystery presents the course of sacred\r\nstory, derived from the Old and the New Testaments, together with\r\nthe lives of the saints from apostolic times to the days of St. Dominic\r\nand St. Louis; it even includes, in an extended sense, subjects from\r\nprofane history--the siege of Orleans, the destruction of Troy--but\r\nsuch subjects are of rare occurrence during the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Derived from _ministerium_ (_metier_), but doubtless\r\noften drawing to itself a sense suggested by the _mysteries_ of\r\nreligion.]\r\n\r\nFor a hundred years, from 1450 onwards, an unbounded enthusiasm for\r\nthe stage possessed the people, not of Paris merely, but of all France.\r\nThe _Confreres de la Passion_, needing a larger repertoire, found\r\nin young ARNOUL GREBAN, bachelor in theology, an author whose vein\r\nwas copious. His _Passion_, written about the middle of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, embraces the entire earthly life of Christ in its thirty-four\r\nthousand verses, which required one hundred and fifty performers and\r\nfour crowded days for the delivery. Its presentation was an\r\nunprecedented event in the history of the theatre. The work of Greban\r\nwas rehandled and enlarged by Jean Michel, and great was the triumph\r\nwhen it was given at Angers in 1486. Greban was not to be outdone\r\neither by his former self or by another dramatist; in collaboration\r\nwith his brother Simon, he composed the yet more enormous _Actes des\r\nApotres_, in sixty-two thousand lines, demanding the services of five\r\nhundred performers. When presented at Bourges as late as 1536, the\r\nhappiness of the spectators was extended over no fewer than forty\r\ndays. The Mystery of the Old Testament, selecting whatever was\r\nsupposed to typify or foreshadow the coming of the Messiah, is only\r\nless vast, and is not less incoherent. Taken together, the Mysteries\r\ncomprise over a million verses, and what remains is but a portion\r\nof what was written.\r\n\r\nThough the literary value of the Mysteries is slight, except in\r\noccasional passages of natural feeling or just characterisation,\r\ntheir historical importance was great; they met a national\r\ndemand--they constituted an animated and moving spectacle of\r\nuniversal interest. A certain unity they possessed in the fact that\r\neverything revolved around the central figure of Christ and the\r\ncentral theme of man's salvation; but such unity is only to be\r\ndiscovered in a broad and distant view. Near at hand the confusion\r\nseems great. Their loose construction and unwieldy length\r\nnecessarily endangered their existence when a truer feeling for\r\nliterary art was developed. The solemnity of their matter gave rise\r\nto a further danger; it demanded some relief, and that relief was\r\nsecured by the juxtaposition of comic scenes beside scenes of gravest\r\nimport. Such comedy was occasionally not without grace--a passage\r\nof pastoral, a song, a naive piece of gaiety; but buffoonery or vulgar\r\nriot was more to the taste of the populace. It was pushed to the\r\nfurthest limit, until in 1548 the Parlement of Paris thought fit to\r\ninterdict the performance of sacred dramas which had lost the sense\r\nof reverence and even of common propriety. They had scandalised\r\nserious Protestants; the Catholics declined to defend what was\r\nindefensible; the humanists and lovers of classical art in\r\nRenaissance days thought scorn of the rude mediaeval drama. Though\r\nit died by violence, its existence could hardly have been prolonged\r\nfor many years. But in the days of its popularity the performance\r\nof a mystery set a whole city in motion; carpenters, painters,\r\ncostumiers, machinists were busy in preparation; priests, scholars,\r\ncitizens rehearsed their parts; country folk crowded to every\r\nhostelry and place of lodging. On the day preceding the first morning\r\nof performance the personages, duly attired--Christians, Jews,\r\nSaracens, kings, knights, apostles, priests--defiled through the\r\nstreets on their way to the cathedral to mass. The vast stage hard\r\nby the church presented, with primitive properties, from right to\r\nleft, the succession of places--lake, mountain, manger, prison,\r\nbanquet-chamber--in which the action should be imagined; and from\r\none station to another the actors passed as the play proceeded. At\r\none end of the stage rose heaven, where God sat throned; at the other,\r\nhell-mouth gaped, and the demons entered or emerged. Music aided the\r\naction; the drama was tragedy, comedy, opera, pantomime in one. The\r\nactors were amateurs from every class of society--clergy, scholars,\r\ntradesmen, mechanics, occasionally members of the _noblesse_. In\r\nParis the Confraternity of the Passion had almost an exclusive right\r\nto present these sacred plays; in the provinces associations were\r\nformed to carry out the costly and elaborate performance. To the\r\n_Confreres de la Passion_--bourgeois folk and artisans--belonged the\r\nfirst theatre, and it was they who first presented plays at regular\r\nintervals. From the Hospital of the Trinity, originally a shelter\r\nfor pilgrims, they migrated in 1539 to the Hotel de Flandres, and\r\nthence in 1548 to the Hotel de Bourgogne. Their famous place of\r\nperformance passed in time into the hands of professional actors;\r\nbut it was not until 1676 that the Confrerie ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nComedy, unlike the serious drama, suffered no breach of continuity\r\nduring its long history. The jongleurs of the Middle Ages were the\r\nimmediate descendants of the Roman mimes and histrions; their\r\ndeclamations, accompanied by gestures, at least tended towards the\r\ndramatic form. Classical comedy was never wholly forgotten in the\r\nschools; the liturgical drama and the sacred pieces developed from\r\nit had an indirect influence as encouraging dramatic feeling, and\r\nproviding models which could be applied to other uses. The earliest\r\nsurviving _jeux_ are of Arras, the work of ADAM DE LA HALLE. In the\r\n_Jeu d'Adam_ or _de la Feuillee_ (_c_. 1262) satirical studies of\r\nreal life mingle strangely with fairy fantasy; the poet himself,\r\nlamenting his griefs of wedlock, his father, his friends are\r\nhumorously introduced; the fool and the physician play their\r\nlaughable parts; and the three fay ladies, for whom the citizens have\r\nprepared a banquet under _la feuillee_, grant or refuse the wishes\r\nof the mortal folk in the traditional manner of enchantresses amiable\r\nor perverse. The _Jeu de Robin et Marlon_--first performed at Naples\r\nin 1283--is a pastoral comic opera, with music, song, and dance; the\r\ngood Marion is loyal to her rustic lover, and puts his rival, her\r\ncavalier admirer, to shame. These were happy inventions happily\r\nexecuted; but they stand alone. It is not until we reach the fifteenth\r\ncentury that mediaeval comedy, in various forms, attained its true\r\nevolution.\r\n\r\nThe Moralities, of which sixty-five survive, dating, almost all, from\r\n1450 to 1550, differed from the Mysteries in the fact that their\r\npurpose was rather didactic than religious; as a rule they handled\r\nneither historical nor legendary matter; they freely employed\r\nallegorical personification after the fashion of the _Roman de la\r\nRose_. The general type is well exemplified in _Bien-Avise,\r\nMal-Avise_, a kind of dramatic Pilgrim's Progress, with two\r\npilgrims--one who is instructed in the better way by all the\r\npersonified powers which make for righteousness; the other finding\r\nhis companions on the primrose path, and arriving at the everlasting\r\nbonfire. Certain Moralities attack a particular vice--gluttony or\r\nblasphemy, or the dishonouring of parents. From satirising the social\r\nvices of the time, the transition was easy to political satire or\r\ninvective. In the sixteenth century both the partisans of the\r\nReformation and the adherents to the traditional creed employed the\r\nMorality as a medium for ecclesiastical polemics. Sometimes treating\r\nof domestic manners and morals, it became a kind of bourgeois drama,\r\npresenting the conditions under which character is formed. Sometimes\r\nagain it approached the farce: two lazy mendicants, one blind, the\r\nother lame, fear that they may suffer a cure and lose their trade\r\nthrough the efficacy of the relics of St. Martin; the halt, mounted\r\non the other's back, directs his fellow in their flight; by ill luck\r\nthey encounter the relic-bearers, and are restored in eye and limb;\r\nthe recovered cripple swears and rages; but the man born blind,\r\nravished by the wonders of the world, breaks forth in praise to God.\r\nThe higher Morality naturally selected types of character for satire\r\nor commendation. It is easy to perceive how such a comic art as that\r\nof Moliere lay in germ in this species of the mediaeval drama. At\r\na late period examples are found of the historical Morality. The\r\npathetic _l'Empereur qui tua son Neveu_ exhibits in its action and\r\nits stormy emotion something of tragic power. The advent of the\r\npseudo-classical tragedy of the Pleiade checked the development of\r\nthis species. The very name \"Morality\" disappears from the theatre\r\nafter 1550.\r\n\r\nThe _sottie_, like the Morality, was a creation of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. Whether it had its origin in a laicising of the irreverent\r\ncelebration of the Feast of Fools, or in that parade of fools which\r\nsometimes preceded a Mystery, it was essentially a farce, but a farce\r\nin which the performers, arrayed in motley, and wearing the long-eared\r\ncap, distributed between them the several roles of human folly.\r\nAssociations of _sots_, known in Paris as _Enfants sans Souci_, known\r\nin other cities by other names, presented the unwisdom or madness\r\nof the world in parody. The _sottie_ at times rose from a mere\r\ndiversion to satire; like the Morality, it could readily adapt itself\r\nto political criticism. The _Gens Nouveaux_, belonging perhaps to\r\nthe reign of Louis XI., mocks the hypocrisy of those sanguine\r\nreformers who promise to create the world anew on a better model,\r\nand yet, after all, have no higher inspiration than that old greed\r\nfor gold and power and pleasure which possessed their predecessors.\r\nLouis XII., who permitted free comment on public affairs from actors\r\non the stage, himself employed the poet Pierre Gringoire to satirise\r\nhis adversary the Pope. In 1512 the _Jeu du Prince des Sots_ was given\r\nin Paris; Gringoire, the _Mere-Sotte_, but wearing the Papal robes\r\nto conceal for a time the garb of folly, discharged a principal part.\r\nSuch dangerous pleasantries as this were vigorously restrained by\r\nFrancois I.\r\n\r\nA dramatic monologue or a _sermon joyeux_ was commonly interposed\r\nbetween the _sottie_ and the Morality or miracle which followed. The\r\nsermon parodied in verse the pulpit discourses of the time, with text\r\nduly announced, the customary scholastic divisions, and an\r\nincredible licence in matter and in phrase. Among the dramatic\r\nmonologues of the fifteenth century is found at least one little\r\nmasterpiece, which has been ascribed on insufficient grounds to\r\nVillon, and which would do no discredit to that poet's genius--the\r\n_Franc-Archer de Bagnolet_. The francs-archers of Charles VII.--a\r\nrural militia--were not beloved of the people; the _miles gloriosus_\r\nof Bagnolet village, boasting largely of his valour, encounters a\r\nstuffed scarecrow, twisting to the wind; his alarms, humiliations,\r\nand final triumph are rendered in a monologue which expounds the\r\naction of the piece with admirable spirit.\r\n\r\nIf the Mystery served to fill the void left by the national epopee,\r\nthe farce may be regarded as to some extent the dramatic inheritor\r\nof the spirit of the fabliau. It aims at mirth and laughter for their\r\nown sakes, without any purpose of edification; it had, like the\r\nfabliau, the merit of brevity, and not infrequently the fault of\r\nunabashed grossness. But the very fact that it was a thing of little\r\nconsequence allowed the farce to exhibit at times an audacity of\r\npolitical or ecclesiastical criticism which transformed it into a\r\ndramatised pamphlet. In general it chose its matter from the ludicrous\r\nmisadventures of private life: the priest, the monk, the husband,\r\nthe mother-in-law, the wife, the lover, the roguish servant are the\r\nagents in broadly ludicrous intrigues; the young wife lords it over\r\nher dotard husband, and makes mockery of his presumptive heirs, in\r\n_La Cornette_ of Jean d'Abondance; in _Le Cuvier_, the husband, whose\r\nmany household duties have been scheduled, has his revenge--the list,\r\nwhich he deliberately recites while his wife flounders helpless in\r\nthe great washing-tub, does not include the task of effecting her\r\ndeliverance.\r\n\r\nAmid much that is trivial and much that is indecent, one farce stands\r\nout pre-eminent, and may indeed be called a comedy of manners and\r\nof character--the merry misfortunes of that learned advocate,\r\n_Maitre Pierre Pathelin_. The date is doubtless about 1470; the author,\r\nprobably a Parisian and a member of the Basoche, is unknown. With\r\nall his toiling and cheating, Pathelin is poor; with infinite art\r\nand spirit he beguiles the draper of the cloth which will make himself\r\na coat and his faithful Guillemette a gown; when the draper, losing\r\nno time, comes for his money and an added dinner of roast goose, behold\r\nMaitre Pathelin is in a raging fever, raving in every dialect. Was\r\nthe purchase of his cloth a dream, or work of the devil? To add to\r\nthe worthy tradesman's ill-luck, his shepherd has stolen his wool\r\nand eaten his sheep. The dying Pathelin unexpectedly appears in court\r\nto defend the accused, and having previously advised his client to\r\naffect idiocy and reply to all questions with the senseless utterance\r\n_bee_, he triumphantly wins the case; but the tables are turned when\r\nMaster Pathelin demands his fee, and can obtain no other response\r\nthan _bee_ from the instructed shepherd. The triumph of rogue over\r\nrogue is the only moral of the piece; it is a satire on fair dealing\r\nand justice, and, though the morals of a farce are not to be gravely\r\ninsisted on, such morals as _Maitre Pathelin_ presents agree well\r\nwith the spirit of the age which first enjoyed this masterpiece of\r\ncaricature.\r\n\r\nThe actors in mediaeval comedy, as in the serious drama, were amateurs.\r\nThe members of the academic _puys_ were succeeded by the members of\r\nguilds, or _confreries_, or _societes joyeuses_. Of these societies\r\nthe most celebrated was that of the Parisian _Enfants sans Souci_.\r\nWith this were closely associated the Basochiens, the corporation\r\nof clerks to the _procureurs_ of the Parlement of Paris.[3] It may\r\nbe that the _sots_ of the capital were only members of the _basoche_,\r\nassuming for the occasion the motley garb. In colleges, scholars\r\nperformed at first in Latin plays, but from the fifteenth century\r\nin French. At the same time, troupes of performers occasionally moved\r\nfrom city to city, exhibiting a Mystery, but they did not hold together\r\nwhen the occasion had passed. Professional comedians were brought\r\nfrom Italy to Lyons in 1548, for the entertainment of Henri II. and\r\nCatherine de Medicis. From that date companies of French actors appear\r\nto become numerous. New species of the drama--tragedy, comedy,\r\npastoral--replace the mediaeval forms; but much of the genius of\r\nFrench classical comedy is a development from the Morality, the\r\n_sottie_, and the farce. To present these newer forms the service\r\nof trained actors was required. During the last quarter of the\r\nsixteenth century the amateur performers of the ancient drama finally\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: This corporation, known as the _Royaume de la Basoche_\r\n(_basilica_), was probably as old as the fourteenth century.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE SECOND\r\n_THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\nRENAISSANCE AND REFORMATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe literature of the sixteenth century is dominated by two chief\r\ninfluences--that of the Renaissance and that of the Reformation. When\r\nFrench armies under Charles VIII. and Louis XII. made a descent on\r\nItaly, they found everywhere a recognition of the importance of art,\r\nan enthusiasm for beauty, a feeling for the aesthetic as well as the\r\nscholarly aspects of antiquity, a new joy in life, an universal\r\ncuriosity, a new confidence in human reason. To Latin culture a Greek\r\nculture had been added; and side by side with the mediaeval master\r\nof the understanding, Aristotle, the master of the imaginative reason,\r\nPlato, was held in honour. Before the first quarter of the sixteenth\r\ncentury closed, France had received a great gift from Italy, which\r\nprofoundly modified, but by no means effaced, the characteristics\r\nof her national genius. The Reformation was a recovery of Christian\r\nantiquity and of Hebraism, and for a time the religious movement made\r\ncommon cause with the Renaissance; but the grave morals, the\r\nopposition of grace to nature, and the dogmatic spirit of theology\r\nafter a time alienated the Reforming party from the mere humanism\r\nof literature and art. An interest in general ideas and a capacity\r\nfor dealing with them were fostered by the study of antiquity both\r\nclassical and Christian, by the meeting of various tendencies, and\r\nby the conflict of rival creeds. To embody general ideas in art under\r\na presiding feeling for beauty, to harmonise thought and form, was\r\nthe great work of the seventeenth century; but before this could be\r\neffected it was necessary that France should enjoy tranquillity after\r\nthe strife of the civil wars.\r\n\r\nLearning had received the distinction of court patronage when Louis\r\nXII. appointed the great scholar Bude his secretary. Around Francis\r\nI., although he was himself rather a lover of the splendour and\r\nornament of the Renaissance than of its finer spirit, men of learning\r\nand poets gathered. On the suggestion of GUILLAUME BUDE he endowed\r\nprofessorships of Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, to which were added those\r\nof medicine, mathematics, and philosophy (1530-40), and in this\r\nprojected foundation of the College de France an important step was\r\nmade towards the secularisation of learned studies. The King's sister,\r\nMARGUERITE OF NAVARRE (1492-1549), perhaps the most accomplished\r\nwoman of her time, represents more admirably than Francis the genius\r\nof the age. She studied Latin, Italian, Spanish, German, Hebrew, and,\r\nwhen forty, occupied herself with Greek. Her heart was ardent as well\r\nas her intellect; she was gay and mundane, and at the same time she\r\nwas serious (with even a strain of mystical emotion) in her concern\r\nfor religion. Although not in communion with the Reformers, she\r\nsympathised with them, and extended a generous protection to those\r\nwho incurred danger through their liberal opinions. Her poems,\r\n_Marguerites de la Marguerite des Princesses_ (1547), show the\r\nmediaeval influences forming a junction with those of the Renaissance.\r\nSome are religious, but side by side with her four dramatic Mysteries\r\nand her eloquent _Triomphe de l'Agneau_ appears the _Histoire des\r\nSatyres et Nymphes de Diane_, imitated from the Italian of Sannazaro.\r\nAmong her latest poems, which remained in manuscript until 1896, are\r\na pastoral dramatic piece expressing her grief for the death of her\r\nbrother Francis I.; a second dramatic poem, _Comedie jouee au Mont\r\nde Marsan_, in which love (human or divine) triumphs over the spirit\r\nof the world, over superstitious asceticism, and over the wiser temper\r\nof religious moderation. _Les Prisons_ tells in allegory of her\r\nservitude to passion, to worldly ambition, and to the desire for human\r\nknowledge, until at last the divine love brought her deliverance.\r\nThe union of the mundane and the moral spirit is singularly shown\r\nin Marguerite's collection of prose tales, written in imitation of\r\nBoccaccio, the _Heptameron des Nouvelles_ (1558).\r\n\r\nThese tales were not an indiscretion of youth; probably Marguerite\r\ncomposed them a few years before her death; perhaps their licence\r\nand wanton mirth were meant to enliven the melancholy hours of her\r\nbeloved brother; certainly the writer is ingenious in extracting\r\nedifying lessons from narratives which do not promise edification.\r\nThey are not so gross as other writings of the time, and this is\r\nMarguerite's true defence; to laugh at the immoralities of monks and\r\npriests was a tradition in literature which neither the spirit of\r\nthe Renaissance nor that of the Reformation condemned. A company of\r\nladies and gentlemen, detained by floods on their return from the\r\nPyrenean baths, beguile the time by telling these tales, and the pious\r\nwidow Dame Oisille gives excellent assistance in showing how they\r\ntend to a moral purpose. The series, designed to equal in number the\r\ntales of the Decameron, is incomplete. Possibly Marguerite was aided\r\nby some one or more of the authors of whom she was the patroness and\r\nprotector; but no sufficient evidence exists for the ascription of\r\nthe _Heptameron_ to Bonaventure des Periers.\r\n\r\nAmong the poets whom Marguerite received with favour at her court\r\nwas CLEMENT MAROT, the versifier, as characterised by Boileau, of\r\n\"elegant badinage.\" His predecessors and early contemporaries in the\r\nopening years of the sixteenth century continued the manner of the\r\nso-called _rhetoriqueurs_, who endeavoured to maintain allegory, now\r\ndecrepit or effete, with the aid of ingenuities of versification and\r\npedantry of diction; or else they carried on something of the more\r\nliving tradition of Villon or of Coquillard. Among the former, Jean\r\nle Maire de Belges deserves to be remembered less for his verse than\r\nfor his prose work, _Illustrations de Gaule et Singularitez de Troie_,\r\nin which the Trojan origin of the French people is set forth with\r\nsome feeling for beauty and a mass of crude erudition. Clement Marot,\r\nborn at Cahors in 1495 or 1496, a poet's son, was for a time in the\r\nservice of Francis I. as _valet de chambre_, and accompanied his\r\nmaster to the battle of Pavia, where he was wounded and made prisoner.\r\nPursued by the Catholics as a heretic, and afterwards by the Genevan\r\nCalvinists as a libertine, he was protected as long as was possible\r\nby the King and by his sister. He died at Turin, a refugee to Italy,\r\nin 1544.\r\n\r\nIn his literary origins Marot belongs to the Middle Ages; he edited\r\nthe _Roman de la Rose_ and the works of Villon; his immediate masters\r\nwere the _grands rhetoriqueurs_; but the spirit of the Renaissance\r\nand his own genius delivered him from the oppression of their\r\nauthority, and his intellect was attracted by the revolt and the\r\npromise of freedom found in the Reforming party. A light and\r\npleasure-loving nature, a temper which made the prudent conduct of\r\nlife impossible, exposed him to risks, over which, aided by protectors\r\nwhom he knew how to flatter with a delicate grace, he glided without\r\nfatal mishap. He did not bring to poetry depth of passion or solidity\r\nof thought; he brought what was needed--a bright intelligence, a sense\r\nof measure and proportion, grace, gaiety, _esprit_. Escaping, after\r\nhis early _Temple de Cupido_, from the allegorising style, he learned\r\nto express his personal sentiments, and something of the gay,\r\nbourgeois spirit of France, with aristocratic distinction. His\r\npoetry of the court and of occasion has lost its savour; but when\r\nhe writes familiarly (as in the _Epitre au Roi pour avoir ete derobe_),\r\nor tells a short tale (like the fable of the rat and the lion), he\r\nis charmingly bright and natural. None of his poems--elegies,\r\nepistles, satires, songs, epigrams, rondeaux, pastorals,\r\nballades--overwhelm us by their length; he was not a writer of vast\r\nimaginative ambitions. His best epigrams are masterpieces in their\r\nkind, with happy turns of thought and expression in which art seems\r\nto have the ease of nature. The satirical epistle supposed to be sent,\r\nnot by Marot, but by his valet, to Marot's adversary, Sagon, is\r\nspirited in its insolence. _L'Enfer_ is a satiric outbreak of\r\nindignation suggested by his imprisonment in the Chatelet on the\r\ncharge of heresy. His versified translation of forty-nine Psalms\r\nadded to his glory, and brought him the honour of personal danger\r\nfrom the hostility of the Sorbonne; but to attempt such a translation\r\nis to aim at what is impossible. His gift to French poetry is\r\nespecially a gift of finer art--firm and delicate expression,\r\nfelicity in rendering a thought or a feeling, certainty and grace\r\nin poetic evolution, skill in handling the decasyllabic line. A great\r\npoet Marot was not, and could not be; but, coming at a fortunate moment,\r\nhis work served literature in important ways; it was a return from\r\nlaboured rhetoric to nature. In the classical age his merit was\r\nrecognised by La Bruyere, and the author of the _Fables_ and the\r\n_Contes_--in some respects a kindred spirit--acknowledged a debt to\r\nMarot.\r\n\r\nFrom Marot as a poet much was learned by Marguerite of Navarre. Of\r\nhis contemporaries, who were also disciples, the most distinguished\r\nwas MELIN DE SAINT-GELAIS, and on the master's death Melin passed\r\nfor an eminent poet. We can regard him now more justly, as one who\r\nin slender work sought for elegance, and fell into a mannered\r\nprettiness. While preserving something of the French spirit, he\r\nsuffered from the frigid ingenuities which an imitation of Italian\r\nmodels suggested to him; but it cannot be forgotten that Saint-Gelais\r\nbrought the sonnet from Italy into French poetry. The school of Marot,\r\nambitious in little things, affected much the _blason_, which\r\ncelebrates an eyebrow, a lip, a bosom, a jewel, a flower, a precious\r\nstone; lyrical inspiration was slender, but clearness and grace were\r\nworth attaining, and the conception of poetry as a fine art served\r\nto lead the way towards Ronsard and the Pleiade.\r\n\r\nThe most powerful personality in literature of the first half of the\r\nsixteenth century was not a poet, though he wrote verses, but a great\r\ncreator in imaginative prose, great partly by virtue of his native\r\ngenius, partly because the sap of the new age of enthusiasm for science\r\nand learning was thronging in his veins--FRANCOIS RABELAIS. Born\r\nabout 1490 or 1495, at Chinon, in Touraine, of parents in a modest\r\nstation, he received his education in the village of Seuille and at\r\nthe convent of La Baumette. He revolted against the routine of the\r\nschools, and longed for some nutriment more succulent and savoury.\r\nFor fifteen years he lived as a Franciscan monk in the cell and\r\ncloisters of the monastery at Fontenay-le-Comte. In books, but not\r\nthose of a monastic library, he found salvation; mathematics,\r\nastronomy, law, Latin, Greek consoled him during his period of\r\nuncongenial seclusion. His criminal companions--books which might\r\nbe suspected of heresy--were sequestrated. The young Bishop of\r\nMaillezais--his friend Geoffroy d'Estissac, who had aided his\r\nstudies--and the great scholar Bude came to his rescue, and passing\r\nfirst, by favour of the Pope, to the Benedictine abbey of Maillezais,\r\nbefore long he quitted the cloister, and, as a secular priest, began\r\nhis wanderings of a scholar in search of universal knowledge. In\r\n1530-31 he was at Montpellier, studying medicine and lecturing on\r\nmedical works of Hippocrates and Galen; next year, at Lyons, one of\r\nthe learned group gathered around the great printers of that city,\r\nhe practised his art of physic in the public hospital, and was known\r\nas a scientific author. Towards the close of 1532 he re-edited the\r\npopular romance _Chroniques Gargantuines_, which tells the\r\nadventures of the \"enormous giant Gargantua.\" It was eagerly read,\r\nand brought laughter to the lips of Master Rabelais' patients.\r\nLearning, he held, was good, but few things in this world are\r\nwholesomer than laughter. The success of the _Chroniques_ seems to\r\nhave moved him to write a continuation, and in 1533 appeared\r\n_Pantagruel_, the story of the deeds and prowess of Gargantua's giant\r\nson, newly composed by Alcofribas Nasier, an anagram which concealed\r\nthe name of Francois Rabelais. It forms the second of the five books\r\nwhich make up its author's famous work. A recast or rather a new\r\ncreation of the Chronicles of Gargantua, replacing the original\r\n_Chroniques_, followed in 1535. It was not until 1546 and 1552 that\r\nthe second and--in its complete form--the third books of _Pantagruel_\r\nappeared, and the authorship was acknowledged. The last book was\r\nposthumous (1562 in part, 1564 in full), and the inferiority of style,\r\ntogether with the more bitter spirit of its satire, have led many\r\ncritics to the opinion that it is only in part from the hand of the\r\ngreat and wise humourist.\r\n\r\nRabelais was in Rome in 1534, and again in 1535, as physician to the\r\nFrench ambassador, Jean du Bellay, Bishop of Paris. He pursued his\r\nscientific studies in medicine and botany, took lessons in Arabic,\r\nand had all a savant's intelligent curiosity for the remains of\r\nantiquity. Some years of his life were passed in wandering from one\r\nFrench university to another. Fearing the hostility of the Sorbonne,\r\nduring the last illness of his protector Francis I., he fled to the\r\nimperial city of Metz. He was once again in Rome with Cardinal du\r\nBellay, in 1549. Next year the author of _Pantagruel_ was appointed\r\ncure of Meudon, near Paris, but, perhaps as a concession to public\r\nopinion, he resigned his clerical charges on the eve of the\r\npublication of his fourth book. Rabelais died probably in 1552 or\r\n1553, aged about sixty years.\r\n\r\nOn his death it might well have been said that the gaiety of nations\r\nwas eclipsed; but to his contemporaries Rabelais appeared less as\r\nthe enormous humourist, the buffoon Homer, than as a great scholar\r\nand man of science, whose bright temper and mirthful conversation\r\nwere in no way inconsistent with good sense, sound judgment, and even\r\na habit of moderation. It is thus that he should still be regarded.\r\nBelow his laughter lay wisdom; below his orgy of grossness lay a noble\r\nideality; below the extravagances of his imagination lay the\r\nequilibrium of a spirit sane and strong. The life that was in him\r\nwas so abounding and exultant that it broke all dikes and dams; and\r\nlaughter for him needed no justification, it was a part of this\r\nabounding life. After the mediaeval asceticism and the intellectual\r\nbondage of scholasticism, life in Rabelais has its vast outbreak and\r\nexplosion; he would be no fragment of humanity, but a complete man.\r\nHe would enjoy the world to the full, and yet at the same time there\r\nis something of stoicism in his philosophy of life; while gaily\r\naccepting the good things of the earth, he would hold himself detached\r\nfrom the gifts of fortune, and possess his soul in a strenuous sanity.\r\nLet us return--such is his teaching--to nature, honouring the body,\r\nbut giving higher honour to the intellect and to the moral feeling;\r\nlet us take life seriously, and therefore gaily; let us face death\r\ncheerfully, knowing that we do not wholly die; with light in the\r\nunderstanding and love in the heart, we can confront all dangers and\r\ndefy all doubts.\r\n\r\nHe is the creator of characters which are types. His\r\ngiants--Grandgousier, Gargantua, Pantagruel--are giants of good\r\nsense and large benevolence. The education of Pantagruel presents\r\nthe ideal pedagogy of the Renaissance, an education of the whole\r\nman--mind and body--in contrast with the dwarfing subtleties and\r\nword-spinning of the effete mediaeval schools. Friar John is the monk\r\nwhose passion for a life of activity cannot be restrained; his\r\nviolence is the overflow of wholesome energy. It is to his care that\r\nthe Abbey of Thelema is confided, where young men and maidens are\r\nto be occupied with every noble toil and every high delight, an abbey\r\nwhose rule has but a single clause (since goodness has no rule save\r\nfreedom), \"Do what you will.\" Of such a fraternity, love and marriage\r\nare the happiest outcome. Panurge, for whom the suggestion was derived\r\nfrom the macaronic poet Folengo, is the fellow of Shakespeare's\r\nFalstaff, in his lack of morals, his egoism, his inexhaustible wit;\r\nhe is the worst and best of company. We would dispense with such a\r\ndisreputable associate if we could, but save that he is a \"very wicked\r\nlewd rogue,\" he is \"the most virtuous man in the world,\" and we cannot\r\npart with him. Panurge would marry, but fears lest he may be the victim\r\nof a faithless wife; every mode of divination, every source of\r\nprediction except one is resorted to, and still his fate hangs\r\nthreatening; it only remains to consult the oracle of La Dive\r\nBouteille. The voyaging quest is long and perilous; in each island\r\nat which the adventurers touch, some social or ecclesiastical abuse\r\nis exhibited for ridicule; the word of the oracle is in the end the\r\nmysterious \"Drink\"--drink, that is, if one may venture to interpret\r\nan oracle, of the pure water of wisdom and knowledge, and let the\r\nunknown future rest.\r\n\r\nThe obscenity and ordure of Rabelais were to the taste of his time;\r\nhis severer censures of Church and State were disguised by his\r\nbuffoonery; flinging out his good sense and wise counsels with a\r\nliberal hand, he also wields vigorously the dunghill pitchfork. If\r\nhe is gross beyond what can be described, he is not, apart from the\r\nevil of such grossness, a corrupter of morals, unless morals be\r\ncorrupted by a belief in the goodness of the natural man. The graver\r\nwrongs of his age--wars of ambition, the abuse of public justice,\r\nthe hypocrisies, cruelties, and lethargy of the ecclesiastics,\r\ndistrust of the intellectual movement, spurious ideals of life--are\r\nvigorously condemned. Rabelais loves goodness, charity, truth; he\r\npleads for the right of manhood to a full and free development of\r\nall its powers; and if questions of original sin and divine grace\r\ntrouble him little, and his creed has some of the hardihood of the\r\nRenaissance, he is full of filial gratitude to _le bon Dieu_ for His\r\ngift of life, and of a world in which to live strongly should be to\r\nlive joyously.\r\n\r\nThe influence of Rabelais is seen in the writers of prose tales who\r\nwere his contemporaries and successors; but they want his broad good\r\nsense and real temperance. BONAVENTURE DES PERIERS, whom Marguerite\r\nof Navarre favoured, and whose _Nouvelles Recreations_, with more\r\nof the tradition of the French fabliaux and farces and less of the\r\nItalian manner, have something in common with the stories of the\r\n_Heptameron_, died in desperation by his own hand about 1543. His\r\nLucianic dialogues which compose the _Cymbalum Mundi_ show the\r\naudacity of scepticism which the new ideas of the Renaissance\r\nengendered in ill-balanced spirits. With all his boldness and ardour\r\nRabelais exercised a certain discretion, and in revising his own text\r\nclearly exhibited a desire to temper valour with prudence.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that just at the time when Rabelais published the\r\nsecond and best book of his _Pantagruel_, in which the ideality and\r\nthe realism of the Renaissance blossom to the full, there was a certain\r\nrevival of the chivalric romance. The Spanish _Amadis des Gaules_\r\n(1540-48), translated by Herberay des Essarts, was a distant echo\r\nof the Romances of the Round Table. The gallant achievements of\r\ncourtly knights, their mystical and platonic loves, were a delight\r\nto Francis I., and charmed a whole generation. Thus, for the first\r\ntime, the literature of Spain reached France, and the influence of\r\n_Amadis_ reappears in the seventeenth century in the romances of\r\nd'Urfe and Mdlle. de Scudery.\r\n\r\nIf the genius of the Renaissance is expressed ardently and amply in\r\nthe writings of Rabelais, the genius of the Reformation finds its\r\nhighest and most characteristic utterance through one whom Rabelais\r\ndescribes as the \"demoniacle\" of Geneva--JEAN CALVIN (1509-64). The\r\npale face and attenuated figure of the great Reformer, whose life\r\nwas a long disease, yet whose indomitable will sustained him amid\r\nbodily infirmities, present a striking contrast to the sanguine\r\nhealth and overflowing animal spirits of the good physician who\r\nreckoned laughter among the means of grace. Yet Calvin was not merely\r\na Reformer: he was also a humanist, who, in his own way, made a profound\r\nstudy of man, and who applied the learning of a master to the\r\ndetermination of dogma. His education was partly theological, partly\r\nlegal; and in his body of doctrine appear some of the rigour, the\r\nseverity, and the formal procedures of the law. Indignation against\r\nthe imprisonment and burning of Protestants, under the pretence that\r\nthey were rebellious anabaptists, drew him from obscurity; silence,\r\nhe thought, was treason. He addressed to the King an eloquent letter,\r\nin which he maintained that the Reformed faith was neither new nor\r\ntending towards schism, and next year (1536) he published his lucid\r\nand logical exposition of Protestant doctrine--the _Christianae\r\nReligionis Institutio_. It placed him, at the age of twenty-seven,\r\nas leader in the forefront of the new religious movement.\r\n\r\nBut the movement was not merely learned, it was popular, and Calvin\r\nwas resolved to present his work to French readers in their own tongue.\r\nHis translation--the _Institution_--appeared probably in 1541.\r\nPerhaps no work by an author of seven-and-twenty had ever so great\r\nan influence. It consists of four books--of God, of Jesus as a Mediator,\r\nof the effects of His mediatorial work, and of the exterior forms\r\nof the Church. The generous illusion of Rabelais, that human nature\r\nis essentially good, has no place in Calvin's system. Man is fallen\r\nand condemned under the law; all his righteousness is as filthy rags;\r\nGod, of His mere good pleasure, from all eternity predestinated some\r\nmen to eternal life and others to eternal death; the Son of God came\r\nto earth to redeem the elect; through the operation of the Holy Spirit\r\nin the gift of faith they are united to Christ, are justified through\r\nHis righteousness imputed to them, and are sanctified in their hearts;\r\nthe Church is the body of the faithful in every land; the officers\r\nof the Church are chosen by the people; the sacraments are\r\ntwo--baptism and the Lord's Supper. In his spirit of system, his\r\nclearness, and the logical enchainment of his ideas, Calvin is\r\neminently French. On the one side he saw the Church of Rome, with--as\r\nhe held--its human tradition, its mass of human superstitions,\r\nintervening between the soul and God; on the other side were the\r\nscepticism, the worldliness, the religious indifference of the\r\nRenaissance. Within the Reforming party there was the conflict of\r\nprivate opinions. Calvin desired to establish once for all, on the\r\nbasis of the Scriptures, a coherent system of dogma which should\r\nimpose itself upon the minds of men as of divine authority, which\r\nshould be at once a barrier against the dangers of superstition and\r\nthe dangers of libertine speculation. As the leaders of the French\r\nRevolution propounded political constitutions founded on the idea\r\nof the rights of man, so Calvin aimed at setting forth a creed\r\nproceeding, if we may so put it, from a conception of the absolute\r\nrights of God. Through the mere good pleasure of our Creator, Ruler,\r\nJudge, we are what we are.\r\n\r\nIt is not perhaps too much to say that Calvin is the greatest writer\r\nof the sixteenth century. He learned much from the prose of Latin\r\nantiquity. Clearness, precision, ordonnance, sobriety, intellectual\r\nenergy are compensations for his lack of grace, imagination,\r\nsensibility, and religious unction. He wrote to convince, to impress\r\nhis ideas upon other minds, and his austere purpose was attained.\r\nIn the days of the pagan Renaissance, it was well for France that\r\nthere should also be a Renaissance of moral rigour; if freedom was\r\nneedful, so also was discipline. On the other hand, it may be admitted\r\nthat Calvin's reason is sometimes the dupe of Calvin's reasoning.\r\n\r\nHis _Life_ was written in French by his fellow-worker in the\r\nReformation, Theodore de Beze, who also recorded the history of the\r\nReformed Churches in France (1580). Beze and Viret, together with\r\ntheir leader Calvin, were eminent in pulpit exposition and\r\nexhortation, and in Beze the preacher was conjoined with a poet. At\r\nCalvin's request he undertook his translation of the Psalms, to\r\ncomplete that by Marot, and in 1551 his sacred drama the _Tragedie\r\nFrancaise du sacrifice d'Abraham_, designed to inculcate the duty\r\nof entire surrender to the divine will, and written with a grave and\r\nrestrained ardour, was presented at the University of Lausanne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\nFROM THE PLEIADE TO MONTAIGNE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe classical Renaissance was not necessarily opposed to high ethical\r\nideals; it was not wholly an affair of the sensuous imagination; it\r\nbrought with it the conception of Roman virtue, and this might well\r\nunite itself (as we see afterwards in Corneille) with Christian faith.\r\nAmong the many translators of the sixteenth century was Montaigne's\r\nearly friend--the friend in memory of all his life--ETIENNE DE LA\r\nBOETIE (1530-63). It is not, however, for his fragments of Plutarch\r\nor his graceful rendering of Xenophon's Economics (named by him the\r\n_Mesnagerie_) that we remember La Boetie; it is rather for his\r\neloquent pleading on behalf of freedom in the _Discours de la\r\nServitude Volontaire_ or _Contr'un_, written at sixteen--revised\r\nlater--in which, with the rhetoric of youth, he utters his invective\r\nagainst tyranny. Before La Boetie's premature death the morals of\r\nantiquity as seen in action had been exhibited to French readers in\r\nthe pages of Amyot's delightful translation of Plutarch's Lives\r\n(1559), to be followed, some years later, by his _OEuvres Morales\r\nde Plutarque_. JACQUES AMYOT (1513-93), from an ill-fed, ragged boy,\r\nrose to be the Bishop of Auxerre. His scholarship, seen not only in\r\nhis Plutarch, but in his rendering of the _Daphnis et Chloe_ of Longus,\r\nand other works, was exquisite; but still more admirable was his sense\r\nof the capacities of French prose. He divined with a rare instinct\r\nthe genius of the language; he felt the affinities between his Greek\r\noriginal and the idioms of his own countrymen; he rather re-created\r\nthan translated Plutarch. \"We dunces,\" wrote Montaigne, \"would have\r\nbeen lost, had not this book raised us from the mire; thanks to it,\r\nwe now venture to speak and write; ... it is our breviary.\" The life\r\nand the ideas of the ancient world became the possession, not of\r\nscholars only, but of all French readers. The book was a school of\r\nmanners and of thought, an inspirer of heroic deeds. \"To love\r\nPlutarch,\" said the greatest Frenchman of the century, Henry of\r\nNavarre, \"is to love me, for he was long the master of my youth.\"\r\n\r\nIt was such an interest in the life and ideas of antiquity as Amyot\r\nconveyed to the general mind of France that was wanting to Ronsard\r\nand the group of poets surrounding him. Their work was concerned\r\nprimarily with literary form; of the life of the world and general\r\nideas, apart from form, they took too little heed. The transition\r\nfrom Marot to Ronsard is to be traced chiefly through the school of\r\nLyons. In that city of the South, letters flourished side by side\r\nwith industry and commerce; Maurice Sceve celebrated his mistress\r\nDelie, \"object of the highest virtue,\" with Petrarchan ingenuities;\r\nand his pupil LOUISE LABE, \"la belle Cordiere,\" sang in her sonnets\r\nof a true passion felt, as she declares, \"en ses os, en son sang,\r\nen son ame.\" The Lyonese poets, though imbued with Platonic ideas,\r\nrather carry on the tradition of Marot than announce the Pleiade.\r\nPIERRE DE RONSARD, born at a chateau a few leagues from Vendome, in\r\nthe year 1524, was in the service of the sons of Francis I. as page,\r\nwas in Scotland with James V., and later had the prospect of a\r\ndistinguished diplomatic career, when deafness, consequent on a\r\nserious malady, closed for him the avenue to public life. He threw\r\nhimself ardently into the study of letters; in company with the boy\r\nAntoine de Baif he received lessons from an excellent Hellenist, Jean\r\nDaurat, soon to be principal of the College Coqueret. At the College\r\na group of students--Ronsard, Baif, Joachim du Bellay, Remi\r\nBelleau--gathered about the master. The \"Brigade\" was formed, which,\r\nby-and-by, with the addition of Jodelle and Pontus de Thyard, and\r\nincluding Daurat, became the constellation of the Pleiade. The seven\r\nassociates read together, translated and imitated the classics; a\r\ncommon doctrine of art banded them in unity; they thought scorn of\r\nthe vulgar ways of popular verse; poetry for them was an arduous and\r\nexquisite toil; its service was a religion. At length, in 1549, they\r\nflung out their manifesto--the _Defense et Illustration de la Langue\r\nFrancaise_ by Du Bellay, the most important study in literary\r\ncriticism of the century. With this should be considered, as less\r\nimportant manifestoes, the later _Art Poetique_ of Ronsard, and his\r\nprefaces to the _Franciade_. To formulate principles is not always\r\nto the advantage of a movement in literature; but champions need a\r\nbanner, reformers can hardly dispense with a definite creed. Against\r\nthe popular conception of the ignorant the Pleiade maintained that\r\npoetry was a high and difficult form of art; against the pedantry\r\nof humanism they maintained that the native tongue of France admitted\r\nof literary art worthy to take its place beside that of Greece or\r\nRome. The French literary vocabulary, they declared, has excellences\r\nof its own, but it needs to be enriched by technical terms, by words\r\nof local dialects, by prudent adoptions from Greek and Latin, by\r\njudicious developments of the existing families of words, by the\r\nrecovery of words that have fallen into disuse.\r\n\r\nIt is unjust to the Pleiade to say that they aimed at overloading\r\npoetic diction with neologisms of classical origin; they sought to\r\ninnovate with discretion; but they unquestionably aimed at the\r\nformation of a poetic diction distinct from that of prose; they turned\r\naway from simplicity of speech to ingenious periphrasis; they desired\r\na select, aristocratic idiom for the service of verse; they\r\nrecommended a special syntax in imitation of the Latin; for the elder\r\nforms of French poetry they would substitute reproductions or\r\nre-creations of classical forms. Rondeaux, ballades, virelais,\r\nchants royaux, chansons are to be cast aside as _epiceries_; and their\r\nplace is to be taken by odes like those of Pindar or of Horace, by\r\nthe elegy, satire, epigram, epic, or by newer forms justified by the\r\npractice of Italian masters. Rich but not over-curious rhymes are\r\nto be cultivated, with in general the alternation of masculine and\r\nfeminine rhymes; the caesura is to fall in accordance with the meaning.\r\nRonsard, more liberal than Du Bellay, permits, on the ground of\r\nclassical example, the gliding from couplet to couplet without a pause.\r\n\"The alexandrine holds in our language the place of heroic verse among\r\nthe Greeks and Romans\"--in this statement is indicated the chief\r\nservice rendered to French poetry by Ronsard and the rest of the\r\nPleiade; they it was who, by their teaching and example, imposed on\r\nlater writers that majestic line, possessing the most varied powers,\r\ncapable of the finest achievements, which has yielded itself alike\r\nto the purposes of Racine and to those of Victor Hugo.\r\n\r\nRonsard and Du Bellay broke with the tradition of the Middle Ages,\r\nand inaugurated the French classical school; it remained for Malherbe,\r\nat a later date, to reform the reformation of the Pleiade, and to\r\nwin for himself the glory which properly belongs to his predecessors.\r\nUnfortunately from its origin the French classical school had in it\r\nthe spirit of an intellectual aristocracy, which removed it from\r\npopular sympathies; unfortunately, also, the poets of the Pleiade\r\nfailed to perceive that the masterpieces of Greece and Rome are\r\nadmirable, not because they belong to antiquity, but because they\r\nare founded on the imitation of nature and on ideas of the reason.\r\nThey were regarded as authorities equal with nature or independent\r\nof it; and thus while the school of Ronsard did much to renew literary\r\nart, its teaching involved an error which eventually tended to the\r\nsterilisation of art. That error found its correction in the\r\nliterature of the seventeenth century, and expressly in the doctrine\r\nset forth by Boileau; yet under the correction some of the\r\nconsequences of the error remained. Ronsard and his followers, on\r\nthe other hand, never made the assumption, common enough in the\r\nseventeenth century, that poetry could be manufactured by observance\r\nof the rules, nor did they suppose that the total play of emotion\r\nmust be rationalised by the understanding; they left a place for the\r\ninstinctive movements of poetic sensibility.\r\n\r\nDuring forty years Ronsard remained the \"Prince of Poets.\" Tasso\r\nsought his advice; the Chancellor Michel de l'Hospital wrote in his\r\npraise; Brantome placed him above Petrarch; Queen Elizabeth and Mary\r\nStuart sent him gifts; Charles IX. on one occasion invited him to\r\nsit beside the throne. In his last hours he was still occupied with\r\nhis art. His death, at the close of 1585, was felt as a national\r\ncalamity, and pompous honours were awarded to his tomb. Yet Ronsard,\r\nthough ambitious of literary distinction, did not lose his true self\r\nin a noisy fame. His was the delicate nature of an artist; his deafness\r\nperhaps added to his timidity and his love of retirement; we think\r\nof him in his garden, cultivating his roses as \"the priest of Flora.\"\r\n\r\nHis work as a poet falls into four periods. From 1550 to 1554 he was\r\na humanist without discretion or reserve. In the first three books\r\nof the _Odes_ he attempted to rival Pindar; in the _Amours de\r\nCassandre_ he emulates the glory of Petrarch. From 1554 to 1560,\r\nabandoning his Pindarism, he was in discipleship to Anacreon[1] and\r\nHorace. It is the period of the less ambitious odes found in the fourth\r\nand fifth books, the period of the _Amours de Marie_ and the _Hymnes_.\r\nFrom 1560 to 1574 he was a poet of the court and of courtly occasions,\r\nan eloquent declaimer on public events in the _Discours des Miseres\r\nde ce Temps_, and the unfortunate epic poet of his unfinished\r\n_Franciade_. During the last ten years of his life he gave freer\r\nexpression to his personal feelings, his sadness, his gladness; and\r\nto these years belong the admirable sonnets to Helene de Surgeres,\r\nhis autumnal love.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _i.e._ the Anacreontic poems, found, and published in\r\n1554, by Henri Estienne.]\r\n\r\nRonsard's genius was lyrical and elegiac, but the tendencies of a\r\ntime when the great affair was the organisation of social life, and\r\nas a consequence the limitation of individual and personal passions,\r\nwere not favourable to the development of lyrical poetry. In his\r\nimitations of Pindar a narrative element checks the flight of song,\r\nand there is a certain unreality in the premeditated attempt to\r\nreproduce the passionate fluctuations and supposed disorder of his\r\nmodel. The study of Pindar, however, trained Ronsard in the handling\r\nof sustained periods of verse, and interested him in complex lyrical\r\ncombinations. His Anacreontic and Horatian odes are far happier;\r\namong these some of his most delightful work is found. If he was\r\ndeficient in great ideas, he had delicacy of sentiment and an\r\nexquisite sense of metrical harmony. The power which he possessed\r\nas a narrative poet appears best in episodes or epic fragments. His\r\nambitious attempt to trace the origin of the French monarchy from\r\nthe imaginary Trojan Francus was unfortunate in its subject, and\r\nequally unfortunate in its form--the rhyming decasyllabic verse.\r\n\r\nIn pieces which may be called hortatory, the pulpit eloquence, as\r\nit were, of a poet addressing his contemporaries on public matters,\r\nthe utterances of a patriot and a citizen moved by pity for his fellows,\r\nsuch poetry as the _Discours des Miseres de ce Temps_ and the\r\n_Institution pour l'Adolescence du Roi, Charles IX._, Ronsard is\r\noriginal and impressive, a forerunner of the orator poets of the\r\nseventeenth century. His eclogues show a true feeling for external\r\nnature, touched at times by a tender sadness. When he escapes from\r\nthe curiosities and the strain of his less happy Petrarchism, he is\r\nan admirable poet of love in song and sonnet; no more beautiful\r\nvariation on the theme of \"gather the rosebuds while ye may\" exists\r\nthan his sonnet _Quand vous serez bien vieille_, unless it be his\r\ndainty ode _Mignonne, allons voir si la Rose_. Passionate in the\r\ndeepest and largest sense Ronsard is not; but it was much to be sincere\r\nand tender, to observe just measure, to render a subtle phase of\r\nemotion. In the fine melancholy of his elegiac poetry he is almost\r\nmodern. Before all else he is a master of his instrument, an inventor\r\nof new effects and movements of the lyre; in his hands the entire\r\nrhythmical system was renewed or was purified. His dexterity in\r\nvarious metres was that of a great virtuoso, and it was not the mere\r\ndexterity which conquers difficulties, it was a skill inspired and\r\nsustained by the sentiment of metre.\r\n\r\nOf the other members of the Pleiade, one--Jodelle--is remembered\r\nchiefly in connection with the history of the drama. Baif (1532-89),\r\nson of the French ambassador at Venice, translated from Sophocles\r\nand Terence, imitated Plautus, Petrarchised in sonnets, took from\r\nVirgil's Georgics the inspiration of his _Meteores_, was guided by\r\nthe Anacreontic poems in his _Passe-Temps_, and would fain rival\r\nTheognis in his most original work _Les Mimes_, where a moral or\r\nsatiric meaning masks behind an allegory or a fable. He desired to\r\nconnect poetry more closely with music, and with this end in view\r\nthought to reform the spelling of words and to revive the quantitative\r\nmetrical system of classical verse.[2] REMI BELLEAU (1528-77)\r\npractised the Horatian ode and the sonnet; translated Anacreon;\r\nfollowed the Neapolitan Sannazaro in his _Bergerie_ of connected\r\nprose and verse, where the shepherds are persons of distinction\r\narrayed in a pastoral disguise; and adapted the mediaeval _lapidary_\r\n(with imitations of the pseudo-Orpheus) to the taste of the\r\nRenaissance in his _Amours et Nouveaux Eschanges des Pierres\r\nPrecieuses_. These little myths and metamorphoses of gems are\r\ningenious and graceful. The delicate feeling for nature which Belleau\r\npossessed is seen at its best in the charming song _Avril_, included\r\nin his somewhat incoherent _Bergerie_. Among his papers was found,\r\nafter his death, a comedy, _La Reconnue_, which, if it has little\r\ndramatic power, shows a certain instinct for satire.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The \"Baifin verse,\" French not classical, is of fifteen\r\nsyllables, divided into hemistichs of seven and eight syllables.]\r\n\r\nThese are minor lights in the poetical constellation; but the star\r\nof JOACHIM DU BELLAY shines with a ray which, if less brilliant than\r\nthat of Ronsard, has a finer and more penetrating influence. Du Bellay\r\nwas born about 1525, at Lire, near Angers, of an illustrious family.\r\nHis youth was unhappy, and a plaintive melancholy haunts his verse.\r\nLike Ronsard he suffered from deafness, and he has humorously sung\r\nits praises. _Olive_, fifty sonnets in honour of his Platonic or\r\nPetrarchan mistress, Mlle. de Viole (the letters of whose name are\r\ntransposed to Olive), appeared almost at the same moment as the\r\nearliest _Odes_ of Ronsard; but before long he could mock in sprightly\r\nstanzas the fantasies and excesses of the Petrarchan style. It was\r\nnot until his residence in Rome (1551) as intendant of his cousin\r\nCardinal du Bellay, the French ambassador, that he found his real\r\nself. In his _Antiquites de Rome_ he expresses the sentiment of ruins,\r\nthe pathos of fallen greatness, as it had never been expressed before.\r\nThe intrigues, corruption, and cynicism of Roman society, his broken\r\nhealth, an unfortunate passion for the Faustina of his Latin verses,\r\nand the longing for his beloved province and little Lire depressed\r\nhis spirits; in the sonnets of his _Regrets_ he embodied his intimate\r\nfeelings, and that lively spirit of satire which the baseness of the\r\nPontifical court summoned into life. This satiric vein had, indeed,\r\nalready shown itself in his mocking counsel to _le Poete courtisan_:\r\nthe courtier poet is to be a gentleman who writes at ease; he is not\r\nto trouble himself with study of the ancients; he is to produce only\r\npieces of occasion, and these in a negligent style; the rarer and\r\nthe smaller they are the better; and happily at last he may cease\r\nto bring forth even these. Possibly his _poete courtisan_ was Melin\r\nde Saint-Gelais. As a rural poet Du Bellay is charming; his _Jeux\r\nRustiques_, while owing much to the _Lusus_ of the Venetian poet\r\nNavagero, have in them the true breath of the fields; it is his _douce_\r\nprovince of Anjou which inspires him; the song to _Venus_ in its\r\nhappiest stanzas is only less admirable than the _Vanneur de Ble_,\r\nwith which more than any other single poem the memory of Du Bellay\r\nis associated. The personal note, which is in general absent from\r\nthe poetry of Ronsard, is poignantly and exquisitely audible in the\r\nbest pieces of Du Bellay. He did not live long enough to witness the\r\ncomplete triumph of the master; in 1560 he died exhausted, at the\r\nage of thirty-five.\r\n\r\nThe Pleiade served literature by their attention to form, by their\r\nskill in poetic instrumentation; but they were incapable of\r\ninterpreting life in any large and original way. In the hands of their\r\nsuccessors poetry languished for want of an inspiring theme. PHILIPPE\r\nDESPORTES (1546-1606) was copious and skilful in his reproduction\r\nand imitation of Italian models; as a courtier poet he reduced\r\nliterary flattery to a fine art; but his mannered graces are cold,\r\nhis pretence of passion is a laboured kind of _esprit_. A copy of\r\nhis works annotated by the hand of Malherbe survives; the comments,\r\nsevere and just, remained unpublished, probably because the writer\r\nwas unwilling to pursue an adversary whom death had removed from his\r\nway. Jean Bertaut, his disciple, is a lesser Desportes. Satire was\r\ndeveloped by Jean Vauquelin de la Fresnaye, and to him we owe an _Art\r\nPoetique_ (1575) which adapts to his own time the teaching of\r\nAristotle and Horace. More interesting than these is JEAN PASSERAT\r\n(1534-1602), whose spirit is that of old France in its mirth and\r\nmockery, and whose more serious verse has the patriotism of French\r\ncitizenship; his field was small, but he tilled his field gaily and\r\ncourageously. The villanelle _J'ai perdu ma tourterelle_ and the ode\r\non May-day show Passerat's art in its happiest moments.\r\n\r\nThe way for a reform in dramatic poetry had been in some degree\r\nprepared by plays of the sixteenth century, written in Latin--the\r\nwork of Buchanan, Muret, and others--by translations from Terence,\r\nSophocles, Euripides, translations from Italian comedy, and\r\nrenderings of one Spanish model, the highly-popular _Celestina_ of\r\nFernando de Rojas. The Latin plays were acted in schools. The first\r\nperformance of a play in French belonging to the new tendency was\r\nthat of Ronsard's translation of the Plutus of Aristophanes, in 1549,\r\nby his friends of the College de Coqueret. It was only by amateurs,\r\nand before a limited scholarly group of spectators, that the new\r\nclassical tragedies could be presented. Gradually both tragedy and\r\ncomedy came to be written solely with a view to publication in print.\r\nThe mediaeval drama still held the stage.\r\n\r\nJODELLE'S _Cleopatre_ (1552), performed with enthusiasm by amateurs,\r\nwas therefore a false start; it was essentially literary, and not\r\ntheatrical. Greek models were crudely imitated, with a lack of almost\r\neverything that gave life and charm to the Greek drama. Seneca was\r\nmore accessible than Sophocles, and his faults were easy to\r\nimitate--his moralisings, his declamatory passages, his excess of\r\nemphasis. The so-called Aristotelian dramatic canons, formulated by\r\nScaliger in his Poetic, were rigorously applied. Unity of place is\r\npreserved in _Cleopatre_; the time of the action is reduced to twelve\r\nhours; there are interminable monologues, choral moralities, a ghost\r\n(in Seneca's manner), a narration of the heroine's death; of action\r\nthere is none, the stage stands still. If Jodelle's _Didon_ has some\r\nliterary merit, it has little dramatic vitality. The oratorical\r\nenergy of Grevin's _Jules Cesar_, the studies of history in _La Mort\r\nde Daire_ and _La Mort d'Alexandre_, by Jacques de La Taille, do not\r\ncompensate their deficiency in the qualities required by the theatre.\r\nOne tragedy alone, _La Sultane_, by Gabriel Bounin (1561), amid its\r\nviolences and extravagances, shows a feeling for dramatic action and\r\nscenic effect.\r\n\r\nCould the mediaeval mystery and classical tragedy be reconciled? The\r\nProtestant Reformer Beze, in his _Sacrifice d'Abraham_, attempted\r\nsomething of the kind; his sacred drama is a mystery by its subject,\r\na tragedy in the conduct of the action. Three tragedies on the life\r\nof David--one of them admirable in its rendering of the love of Michol,\r\ndaughter of Saul--were published in 1556 by Loys Des-Masures: the\r\nstage arrangements are those of the mediaeval drama, but the unity\r\nof time is observed, and chorus and semi-chorus respond in alternate\r\nstrains. No junction of dramatic systems essentially opposed proved\r\nin the end possible. When Jean de La Taille wrote on a biblical subject\r\nin his _Saul le Furieux_, a play remarkable for its impressive\r\nconception and development of the character of Saul, he composed it\r\n_selon l'art_, and in the manner of \"the old tragic authors.\" He is\r\nuncompromising in his classical method; the mediaeval drama seemed\r\ninartificial to him in the large concessions granted by the spectators\r\nto the authors and actors; he would have what passes on the stage\r\napproximate, at least, to reality; the unities were accepted not\r\nmerely on the supposed authority of Aristotle, but because they were\r\nan aid in attaining verisimilitude.\r\n\r\nThe most eminent name in the history of French tragedy of the sixteenth\r\ncentury is that of ROBERT GARNIER (1534-90). His discipleship to\r\nSeneca was at first that of a pupil who reproduces with exaggeration\r\nhis master's errors. Sensible of the want of movement in his scenes,\r\nhe proceeded in later plays to accumulate action upon action without\r\nreducing the action to unity. At length, in _Les Juives_ (1583), which\r\nexhibits the revolt of the Jewish King and his punishment by\r\nNabuchodonosor, he attained something of true pity and terror, beauty\r\nof characterisation, beauty of lyrical utterance in the plaintive\r\nsongs of the chorus. Garnier was assuredly a poet; but even in _Les\r\nJuives_, the best tragedy of his century, he was not a master of\r\ndramatic art. If anywhere he is in a true sense dramatic, it is in\r\nhis example of the new form of tragi-comedy. _Bradamante_, derived\r\nfrom the _Orlando Furioso_ of Ariosto, shows not only poetic\r\nimagination, but a certain feeling for the requirements of the\r\ntheatre.\r\n\r\nComedy in the sixteenth century, dating from Jodelle's _Eugene_, is\r\neither a development of the mediaeval farce, indicated in point of\r\nform by the retention of octosyllabic verse, or an importation from\r\nthe drama of Italy. Certain plays of Aristophanes, of Terence, of\r\nPlautus were translated; but, in truth, classical models had little\r\ninfluence. Grevin, while professing originality, really follows the\r\ntraditions of the farce. Jean de La Taille, in his prose comedy _Les\r\nCorrivaux_, prepared the way for the easy and natural dialogue of\r\nthe comic stage. The most remarkable group of sixteenth-century\r\ncomedies are those translated in prose from the Italian, with such\r\nobvious adaptations as might suit them to French readers, by PIERRE\r\nDE LARIVEY (1540 to after 1611). Of the family of the Giunti, he had\r\ngallicised his own name (_Giunti_, i.e. _Arrives_); and the\r\noriginality of his plays is of a like kind with that of his name;\r\nthey served at least to establish an Italian tradition for comedy,\r\nwhich was not without an influence in the seventeenth century; they\r\nserved to advance the art of dialogue. If any comedy of the period\r\nstands out as superior to its fellows, it is _Les Contents_ (1584),\r\nby Odet de Turnebe, a free imitation of Italian models united with\r\nsomething imported from the Spanish _Celestina_. Its intrigue is an\r\nItalian imbroglio; but there are lively and natural scenes, such as\r\ncan but rarely be found among the predecessors of Moliere. In general\r\nthe comedy of the sixteenth century is wildly confused in plot,\r\nconventional in its types of character, and too often as grossly\r\nindecent as the elder farces. Before the century closed, the pastoral\r\ndrama had been discovered, and received influences from both Italy\r\nand Spain; the soil was being prepared for that delicate flower of\r\npoetry, but as yet its nurture was little understood, nor indeed can\r\nit be said to have ever taken kindly to the climate of France.\r\n\r\nWhile on the one hand the tendencies of the Pleiade may be described\r\nas exotic, going forth, as they did, to capture the gifts of classical\r\nand Italian literature, on the other hand they pleaded strenuously\r\nthat thus only could French literature attain its highest\r\npossibilities. In the scholarship of the time, side by side with the\r\nhumanism which revived and restored the culture of Greece and Rome,\r\nwas another humanism which was essentially national. The historical\r\norigins of France were studied for the first time with something of\r\na critical spirit by CLAUDE FAUCHET in his _Antiquites Gauloises et\r\nFrancoises_ (1579-1601). His _Recueil de l'Origine de la Langue et\r\nPoesie Francoise_, in spite of its errors, was an effort towards\r\nFrench philology; and in calling attention to the trouveres and their\r\nworks, Fauchet may be considered a remote master of the school of\r\nmodern literary research. ESTIENNE PASQUIER (1529-1615), the jurist\r\nwho maintained in a famous action the cause of the University against\r\nthe Jesuits, in his _Recherches de la France_ treated with learning\r\nand vigour various important points in French history--civil and\r\necclesiastical--language, literary history, and the foundation of\r\nuniversities. HENRI ESTIENNE (1531-98), who entered to the full into\r\nthe intoxication of classical humanism, was patriotic in his\r\nreverence for his native tongue. In a trilogy of little treatises\r\n(1565-79), written with much spirit, he maintained that of modern\r\nlanguages the French has the nearest affinity to the Greek, attempted\r\nto establish its superiority to Italian, and much more to Spanish,\r\nand mocked the contemporary fashion of Italianised French.\r\n\r\nThe study of history is supported on the one hand by such erudite\r\nresearch as that of Fauchet and Pasquier; on the other hand it is\r\nsupported by political philosophy and speculation. To philosophy,\r\nin the wider sense of the word, the sixteenth century made no large\r\nand coherent contribution; the Platonism, Pyrrhonism, Epicureanism,\r\nStoicism of the Renaissance met and clashed together; the rival\r\ntheologies of the Roman and Reformed Churches contended in a struggle\r\nfor life. PIERRE DE LA RAMEE (1515-72) expressed the revolt of\r\nrationalism against the methods of the schoolmen and the authority\r\nof Aristotle; but he ordinarily wrote in Latin, and his _Dialectique_,\r\nthe first philosophical work in the vulgar tongue, hardly falls within\r\nthe province of literary history.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy of politics is represented by one great name, that\r\nof JEAN BODIN (1529-96), whose _Republique_ may entitle him to be\r\nstyled the Montesquieu of the Renaissance. In an age which tended\r\ntowards the formation of great monarchies he was vigorously\r\nmonarchical. The patriarchal power of the sovereign might well be\r\nthought needful, in the second half of the century, as a barrier\r\nagainst anarchy; but Bodin was no advocate of tyranny; he condemned\r\nslavery, and held that religious persecution can only lead to a\r\ndissolution of religious belief. A citizen is defined by Bodin as\r\na free man under the supreme government of another; like Montesquieu,\r\nhe devotes attention to the adaptation of government to the varieties\r\nof race and climate. The attempts at a general history of France in\r\nthe earlier part of the sixteenth century preserved the arid methods\r\nand unilluminated style of the mediaeval chronicles;[3] in the second\r\nhalf of the century they imitated with little skill the models of\r\nantiquity. Histories of contemporary events in Europe were written\r\nwith conscientious impartiality by Lancelot de la Popeliniere, and\r\nwith personal and party passion, struggling against his well-meant\r\nresolves, by Agrippa d'Aubigne. The great _Historia mei Temporis_\r\nof De Thou, faithful and austere in its record of fact, was a\r\nhighly-important contribution to literature, but it is written in\r\nLatin.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The narrative of the life of Bayard, by his secretary,\r\nwriting under the name of \"Le Loyal Serviteur\" (1527), is admirable\r\nfor its clearness, grace, and simplicity.]\r\n\r\nWith a peculiar gift for narrative, the French have been long\r\npre-eminent as writers of memoirs, and already in the sixteenth\r\ncentury such personal recitals are numerous. The wars of Francois\r\nI. and of Henri II. gave abundant scope for the display of individual\r\nenterprise and energy; the civil wars breathed into the deeds of men\r\nan intensity of passion; the actors had much to tell, and a motive\r\nfor telling it each in his own interest.\r\n\r\nThe _Commentaires_ of BLAISE DE MONLUC (1502-77) are said to have\r\nbeen named by Henri IV. \"the soldier's Bible\"; the Bible is one which\r\ndoes not always inculcate mercy or peace. Monluc, a Gascon of\r\nhonourable birth and a soldier of fortune, had the instinct of battle\r\nin his blood; from a soldier he rose through every rank to be the\r\nKing's lieutenant of Guyenne and a Marshal of France; during fifty\r\nyears he fought, as a daring captain rather than as a great general,\r\namorous of danger, and at length, terribly disfigured by wounds, he\r\nsat down, not to rest, but to wield his pen as if it were a sword\r\nof steel. His _Commentaires_ were meant to be a manual for hardy\r\ncombatants, and what model could he set before the young aspirant\r\nso animating as himself? In his earlier wars against the foreign foes\r\nof his country, Monluc was indeed a model of military prowess; the\r\ncivil wars added cruelty to his courage; after a fashion he was\r\nreligious, and a short shrift and a cord were good enough for heretics\r\nand adversaries of his King. An unlettered soldier, Monluc, by virtue\r\nof his energy of character and directness of speech, became a most\r\nimpressive and spirited narrator. His Memoirs close with a sigh for\r\nstern and inviolable solitude. Among the Pyrenean rocks he had\r\nformerly observed a lonely monastery, in view at once of Spain and\r\nFrance; there it was his wish to end his days.\r\n\r\nFrom the opposite party in the great religious and political strife\r\ncame the temperate Memoirs of Lanoue, the simple and beautiful record\r\nof her husband's life by Madame de Mornay, and that of his own career,\r\nwritten in an old age of gloom and passion, by D'Aubigne. The ideas\r\nof Henri IV.--himself a royal author in his _Lettres missives_--are\r\nembodied in the _OEconomies Royales_ of the statesman Sully, whose\r\nsecretaries were employed for the occasion in laboriously reciting\r\nhis words and deeds as they had learnt them from their chief. The\r\nsuperficial aspects of the life of society, the manners and morals--or\r\nlack of morals--of the time, are lightly and brightly exhibited by\r\nPIERRE DE BOURDEILLE, lord of BRANTOME, Catholic abbe, soldier and\r\ncourtier, observer of the great world, gossip of amorous secrets.\r\nHis _Vies des Hommes Illustres et des Grands Capitaines_, his _Vies\r\ndes Dames Illustres et des Dames Galantes_, and his _Memoires_\r\ncontained matter too dangerous, perhaps, for publication during his\r\nlifetime, but the author cherished the thought of his posthumous\r\nrenown. Brantome, wholly indifferent to good and evil, had a vivid\r\ninterest in life; virtue and vice concerned him alike and equally,\r\nif only they had vivacity, movement, colour; and although, as with\r\nMonluc, it was a physical calamity that made him turn to authorship,\r\nhe wrote with a naive art, an easy grace, and abundant spirit. To\r\ncorrect and complete Brantome's narrative as it related to herself,\r\nMarguerite, Queen of Navarre, first wife of Henri IV., prepared her\r\nunfinished Memoirs, which opens the delightful series of\r\nautobiographies and reminiscences of women. Her account of the night\r\nof St. Bartholomew is justly celebrated; the whole record, indeed,\r\nis full of interest; but there were passages of her life which it\r\nwas natural that she should pass over in silence; her sins of omission,\r\nas Bayle has observed, are many.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The _Memoires-Journeaux_ of Pierre de l'Estoile are a\r\ngreat magazine of the gains of the writer's disinterested curiosity.\r\nThe _Lettres_ of D'Ossat and the _Negotiations_ of the President\r\nJeannin are of importance in the records of diplomacy.]\r\n\r\nThe controversies of the civil wars produced a militant literature,\r\nin which the extreme parties contended with passion, while between\r\nthese a middle party, the aspirants to conciliation, pleaded for the\r\nways of prudence, and, if possible, of peace. FRANCOIS HOTMAN, the\r\neffect of whose Latin _Franco-Gallia_, a political treatise\r\npresenting the Huguenot demands, has been compared to that of\r\nRousseau's _Contrat Social_, launched his eloquent invective against\r\nthe Cardinal de Lorraine, in the _Epistre envoyee au Tigre de la\r\nFrance_. Hubert Languet, the devoted friend of Philip Sidney, in his\r\n_Vindiciae contra Tyrannos_, justified rebellion against princes who\r\nviolate by their commands the laws of God. D'Aubigne, in his\r\n_Confession de Sancy_, attacked with characteristic ardour the\r\napostates and waverers of the time, above the rest that threefold\r\nrecanter of his faith, Harlay de Sancy. Marnix de Sainte-Aldegonde,\r\nin his _Tableau des Differands de la Religion_, mingles theological\r\nerudition with his raillery against the Roman communion. Henri\r\nEstienne applied the spirit and learning of a great humanist to\r\nreligious controversy in the second part of his _Apologie pour\r\nHerodote_; the marvellous tales of the Greek historian may well be\r\ntrue, he sarcastically maintains, when in this sixteenth century the\r\nabuses of the Roman Church seem to pass all belief. On the other hand,\r\nDu Perron, a cardinal in 1604, replied to the arguments and citations\r\nof the heretics. As the century drew towards its close, violence\r\ndeclined; the struggle was in a measure appeased. In earlier days\r\nthe Chancellor, Michel de l'Hospital, had hoped to establish harmony\r\nbetween the rival parties; grief for the massacre of St. Bartholomew\r\nhastened his death. The learned Duplessis-Mornay, leader and guide\r\nof the Reformed Churches of France, a devoted servant of Henri of\r\nNavarre, while fervent in his own beliefs, was too deeply attached\r\nto the common faith of Christianity to be an extreme partisan. The\r\nreconciliation of Henri IV. with the Church of Rome, which delivered\r\nFrance from anarchy, was, however, a grief to some of his most loyal\r\nsupporters, and of these Duplessis-Mornay was the most eminent.\r\n\r\nThe cause of Henri against the League was served by the manuscript\r\ncirculation of a prose satire, with interspersed pieces of verse,\r\nthe work of a group of writers, moderate Catholics or converted\r\nProtestants, who loved their country and their King, the _Satire\r\nMenipee_.[5] When it appeared in print (1594; dated on the title-page\r\n1593) the cause was won; the satire rose upon a wave of success, like\r\na gleaming crest of bitter spray. It is a parody of the Estates of\r\nthe League which had been ineffectually convoked to make choice of\r\na king. Two Rabelaisian charlatans, one from Spain, one from Lorraine,\r\noffer their drugs for sale in the court of the Louvre; the virtues\r\nof the Spanish Catholicon, a divine electuary, are manifold--it will\r\nchange the blackest criminal into a spotless lamb, it will transform\r\na vulgar bonnet to a cardinal's hat, and at need can accomplish a\r\nscore of other miracles. Presently the buffoon Estates file past to\r\ntheir assembly; the hall in which they meet is tapestried with\r\ngrotesque scenes from history; the order of the sitting is determined,\r\nand the harangues begin, harangues in which each speaker exposes his\r\nown ambitions, greeds, hypocrisies, and egoism, until Monsieur\r\nd'Aubray, the orator of the _tiers etat_, closes the debate with a\r\nspeech in turn indignant, ironical, or grave in its commiseration\r\nfor the popular wrongs--an utterance of bourgeois honesty and good\r\nsense. The writers--Canon Pierre Leroy; Gillot, clerk-advocate of\r\nthe Parliament of Paris; Rapin, a lettered combatant at Ivry; Jean\r\nPasserat, poet and commentator on Rabelais; Chrestien and Pithou,\r\ntwo Protestants discreetly converted by force of events--met in a\r\nroom of Gillot's house, where, according to the legend, Boileau was\r\nafterwards born, and there concocted the venom of their pamphlet.\r\nIts wit, in spite of some extravagances and the tedium of certain\r\npages, is admirable; farce and comedy, sarcasm and moral prudence\r\nalternate; and it had the great good fortune of a satire, that of\r\ncoming at the lucky moment.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Varro, who to a certain extent copied from Menippus the\r\nGadarene, had called his satires _Saturae Menippeae_; hence the\r\ntitle.]\r\n\r\nThe French Huguenots were not without their poets. Two of\r\nthese--Guillaume Saluste, Seigneur du Bartas, and Agrippa\r\nd'Aubigne--are eminent. The fame of DU BARTAS (1544-90) was indeed\r\nEuropean. Ronsard sent him a pen of gold, and feared at a later time\r\nthe rivalry of his renown; Tasso drew inspiration from his verse;\r\nthe youthful Milton read him with admiration in the rendering by\r\nSylvester; long afterwards Goethe honoured him with praise beyond\r\nhis deserts. To read his poems now, notwithstanding passages of vivid\r\ndescription and passages of ardent devotional feeling, would need\r\nrare literary fortitude. His originality lies in the fact that while\r\nhe was a disciple of the Pleiade, a disciple crude, intemperate, and\r\nprovincial, he deserted Greece and Rome, and drew his subjects from\r\nHebraic sources. His _Judith_ (1573), composed by the command of\r\nJeanne d'Albret, has more of Lucan than of Virgil in its over-emphatic\r\nstyle. _La Sepmaine, ou la Creation en Sept Journees_, appeared in\r\n1578, and within a few years had passed through thirty editions. Du\r\nBartas is always copious, sometimes brilliant, sometimes majestic;\r\nbut laboured and rhetorical description, never ending and still\r\nbeginning, fatigues the mind; an encyclopaedia of the works of\r\ncreation weighs heavily upon the imagination; we sigh for the arrival\r\nof the day of rest.\r\n\r\nTHEODORE-AGRIPPA D'AUBIGNE (1550-1630) was not among the admirers\r\nof Du Bartas. His natural temper was framed for pleasure; at another\r\ntime he might have been known only as a poet of the court, of lighter\r\nsatire, and of love; the passions of the age transformed him into\r\nan ardent and uncompromising combatant. His classical culture was\r\nwide and exact; at ten years old he translated the _Crito_; Latin,\r\nGreek, Hebrew, Italian, Spanish were at his command. He might, had\r\nFrance been at peace with herself, have appeared in literature as\r\na somewhat belated Ronsardist; but his hereditary cause became his\r\nown. While still a child he accepted from his father, in presence\r\nof the withering heads of the conspirators of Amboise, the oath of\r\nimmitigable vengeance. Pursuits, escapes, the camp, the battle-field,\r\nthe prison, the court made up no small part of his life of vicissitude\r\nand of unalterable resolve. He roused Henri of Navarre from the\r\nlethargy of pleasure; he warned the King against the crime of\r\napostasy; he dreaded the mass, but could cheerfully have accepted\r\nthe stake. Extreme in his rage of party, he yet in private affairs\r\ncould show good sense and generosity. His elder years were darkened\r\nby what he regarded as treason in his King, and by the falling away\r\nfrom the faith of that son who, by an irony of fate, became the father\r\nof Madame de Maintenon. Four times condemned to death, he died in\r\nexile at the age of eighty.\r\n\r\nD'Aubigne's satirical tale, _Les Aventures du Baron de Faeneste_,\r\ncontrasts the man who _appears_--spreading his plumes in the sunshine\r\nof the court--with the man who _is_, the man who lives upon his estate,\r\namong his rustic neighbours, tilling his fields and serving his people\r\nand his native land. As an elegiac poet D'Aubigne is little more than\r\na degenerate issue from the Pleiade. It is in his vehement poem of\r\nmourning and indignation and woe, _Les Tragiques_, begun in 1577 but\r\nnot published till 1616, that his power is fully manifested. To\r\nD'Aubigne, as its author, the characterisation of Sainte-Beuve\r\nexactly applies: \"Juvenal du xvi. siecle, apre, austere, inexorable,\r\nherisse d'hyperboles, etincelant de beautes, rachetant une rudesse\r\ngrossiere par une sublime energie.\" In seven books it tells of the\r\nmisery of France, the treachery of princes, the abuse of public law\r\nand justice, the fires and chains of religious persecution, the\r\nvengeance of God against the enemies of the saints, and the final\r\njudgment of sinners, when air and fire and water become the accusers\r\nof those who have perverted the powers of nature to purposes of cruelty.\r\nThe poem is ill composed, its rhetoric is often strained or hard and\r\nmetallic, its unrelieved horrors oppress the heart; but the cry of\r\ntrue passion is heard in its finer pages; from amid the turmoil and\r\nsmoke, living tongues of flame seem to dart forth which illuminate\r\nthe gloom. The influence of _Les Tragiques_ may still be felt in\r\npassages of Victor Hugo's fulgurant eloquence.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of strife, however, there were men who pursued the\r\ndisinterested service of humanity and whose work made for peace. The\r\ngreat surgeon Ambroise Pare, full of tolerance and deeply pious,\r\nadvanced his healing art on the battle-field or amid the ravages of\r\npestilence, and left a large contribution to the literature of science.\r\nBernard Palissy, a devout Huguenot, was not only the inventor of\r\n\"rustic figulines,\" the designer of enamelled cups and platters, but\r\na true student of nature, who would substitute the faithful\r\nobservation of phenomena for vain and ambitious theory. Olivier de\r\nSerres, another disciple of Calvin, cultivated his fields, helped\r\nto enrich France by supporting Henri IV. in the introduction of the\r\nindustry in silk, and amassed his knowledge and experience in his\r\nadmirably-written _Theatre d'Agriculture_. At a later date Antoine\r\nde Montchrestien, adventurous and turbulent in his Protestant zeal,\r\nthe writer of tragedies which connect the sixteenth century with the\r\nclassical school of later years, became the advocate of a\r\nprotectionist and a colonial policy in his _Traicte de l'OEconomie\r\nPolitique_; the style of his essay towards economic reform has some\r\nof the passion and enthusiasm of a poet.\r\n\r\nA refuge from the troubles and vicissitudes of the time was sought\r\nby some in a Christianised Stoicism. Guillaume du Vair (1556-1621),\r\neminent as a magistrate, did not desert his post of duty; he pleaded\r\neloquently, as chief orator of the middle party of conciliation, on\r\nbehalf of unity under Henri of Navarre. In his treatise on French\r\neloquence he endeavoured to elevate the art of public speaking above\r\nlaboured pedantry to true human discourse. But while taking part in\r\nthe contentious progress of events, he saw the flow of human affairs\r\nas from an elevated plateau. In the conversations with friends which\r\nform his treatise _De la Constance et Consolation es Calamites\r\nPubliques_, Du Vair's counsels are those of courage and resignation,\r\nnot unmingled with hope. He rendered into French the stoical morals\r\nof Epictetus; and in his own _Sainte Philosophie_ and _Philosophie\r\nMorale des Stoiques_ he endeavoured, with honest purpose, rather than\r\nwith genius, to ally speculation to religion, and to show how human\r\nreason can lead the way to those ethical truths which are the guiding\r\nlights of conduct.\r\n\r\nPerhaps certitude sufficient for human life may be found by\r\nlimitation; a few established truths will, after all, carry us from\r\nthe cradle to the grave; and beyond the bounds of certitude lies a\r\nlimitless and fascinating field for observation and dubious\r\nconjecture. Amid the multitude of new ideas which the revival of\r\nantiquity brought with it, amid the hot disputes of the rival churches,\r\namid the fierce contentions of civil war, how delightful to possess\r\none's soul in quiet, to be satisfied with the needful knowledge, small\r\nthough it be, which is vouchsafed to us, and to amuse the mind with\r\nevery opinion and every varying humour of that curious and wayward\r\ncreature man! And who so wayward, who so wavering as one's self in\r\nall those parts of our composite being which are subject to the play\r\nof time and circumstance? Such, in an age of confusion working towards\r\nclearness, an age of belligerency tending towards concord, were the\r\nreflections of a moralist, the most original of his century--Michel\r\nde Montaigne.\r\n\r\nMICHEL EYQUEM, SEIGNEUR DE MONTAIGNE, was born at a chateau in\r\nPerigord, in the year 1533. His father, whom Montaigne always\r\nremembered with affectionate reverence, was a man of original ideas.\r\nHe entrusted the infant to the care of peasants, wishing to attach\r\nhim to the people; educated him in Latin as if his native tongue;\r\nroused him at morning from sleep to the sound of music. From his sixth\r\nto his thirteenth year Montaigne was at the College de Guyenne, where\r\nhe took the leading parts in Latin tragedies composed by Muret and\r\nBuchanan. In 1554 he succeeded his father as councillor in the court\r\n_des aides_ of Perigueux, the members of which were soon afterwards\r\nincorporated in the Parliament of Bordeaux. But nature had not\r\ndestined Montaigne for the duties of the magistracy; he saw too many\r\nsides of every question; he chose rather to fail in justice than in\r\nhumanity. In 1565 he acquired a large fortune by marriage, and having\r\nlost his father, he retired from public functions in 1570, to enjoy\r\na tranquil existence of meditation, and of rambling through books.\r\nHe had published, a year before, in fulfilment of his father's desire,\r\na translation of the _Theologia Naturalis_ of Raimond de Sebonde,\r\na Spanish philosopher of the fifteenth century; and now he occupied\r\nhimself in preparing for the press the writings of his dead friend\r\nLa Boetie. Love for his father and love for his friend were the two\r\npassions of Montaigne's life. From 1571 to 1580 he dwelt in retreat,\r\nin company with his books and his ideas, indulging his humour for\r\ntranquil freedom of the mind. It was his custom to enrich the margins\r\nof his books with notes, and his earliest essays may be regarded as\r\nan extension of such notes; Plutarch and Seneca were, above all, his\r\nfavourites; afterwards, the volume which he read with most enjoyment,\r\nand annotated most curiously, was that of his own life.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, Montaigne's daily life, with outward monotony and\r\ninternal variety, was a pleasant miscellany on which to comment. He\r\nwas of a middle temperament, \"between the jovial and the melancholic\";\r\na lover of solitude, yet the reverse of morose; choosing bright\r\ncompanions rather than sad; able to be silent, as the mood took him,\r\nor to gossip; loyal and frank; a hater of hypocrisy and falsehood;\r\na despiser of empty ceremony; disposed to interpret all things to\r\nthe best; cheerful among his children; careless of exercising\r\nauthority; incapable of household management; trustful and kind\r\ntowards his neighbours; indulgent in his judgments, yet warm in his\r\nadmiration of old, heroic virtue. His health, which in boyhood had\r\nbeen robust, was shaken in middle life by an internal malady. He\r\ntravelled in the hope of finding strength, visiting Germany,\r\nSwitzerland, Italy, Tyrol, and observing, with a serious amusement,\r\nthe varieties of men and manners. While still absent from France,\r\nin 1581, he learned that he had been elected mayor of Bordeaux; he\r\nhesitated in accepting an honourable but irksome public office; the\r\nKing permitted no dallying, and Montaigne obeyed. Two years later\r\nthe mayor was re-elected; it was a period of difficulty; a Catholic\r\nand a Royalist, he had a heretic brother, and himself yielded to the\r\ncharm of Henri of Navarre; \"for the Ghibelline I was a Guelph, for\r\nthe Guelph a Ghibelline.\" When, in 1585, pestilence raged in Bordeaux,\r\nMontaigne's second period of office had almost expired; he quitted\r\nthe city, and the election of his successor took place in his absence.\r\nHis last years were brightened by the friendship--almost filial--of\r\nMlle. de Gournay, an ardent admirer, and afterwards editor, of the\r\n_Essais_. In 1592 Montaigne died, when midway in his sixtieth year.\r\n\r\nThe first two books of the _Essais_ were published by their author\r\nin 1580; in 1588 they appeared in an augmented text, with the addition\r\nof the third book. The text superintended by Mlle. de Gournay, based\r\nupon a revised and enlarged copy left by Montaigne, is of the year\r\n1595.\r\n\r\nThe unity of the book, which makes no pretence to unity, may be found\r\nin the fact that all its topics are concerned with a common\r\nsubject--the nature of man; that the writer accepts himself as the\r\nexample of humanity most open to his observation; and that the same\r\ntranquil, yet insatiable curiosity is everywhere present. Man, as\r\nconceived by Montaigne, is of all creatures the most variable,\r\nunstable, inconstant. The species includes the saint and the brute,\r\nthe hero and the craven, while between the extremes lies the average\r\nman, who may be anything that nature, custom, or circumstances make\r\nhim. And as the species varies indefinitely, so each individual varies\r\nendlessly from himself: his conscience controls his temperament; his\r\ntemperament betrays his conscience; external events transform him\r\nfrom what he was. Do we seek to establish our moral being upon the\r\nrock of philosophical dogma? The rock gives way under our feet, and\r\nscatters as if sand. Such truth as we can attain by reason is relative\r\ntruth; let us pass through knowledge to a wise acceptance of our\r\nignorance; let us be contented with the probabilities which are all\r\nthat our reason can attain. The truths of conduct, as far as they\r\nare ascertainable, were known long since to the ancient moralists.\r\nCan any virtue surpass the old Roman virtue? We believe in God,\r\nalthough we know little about His nature or His operations; and why\r\nshould we disbelieve in Christianity, which happens to be part of\r\nthe system of things under which we are born? But why, also, should\r\nwe pay such a compliment to opinions different from our own as to\r\nburn a heretic because he prefers the Pope of Geneva to the Pope of\r\nRome? Let each of us ask himself, \"Que sais-je?\"--\"What do I really\r\nknow?\" and the answer will serve to temper our zeal.\r\n\r\nWhile Montaigne thus saps our confidence in the conclusions of the\r\nintellect, when they pass beyond a narrow bound, he pays a homage\r\nto the force of will; his admiration for the heroic men of Plutarch\r\nis ardent. An Epicurean by temperament, he is a Stoic through his\r\nimagination; but for us and for himself, who are no heroes, the\r\nappropriate form of Stoical virtue is moderation within our sphere,\r\nand a wise indifference, or at most a disinterested curiosity, in\r\nmatters which lie beyond that sphere. Let us resign ourselves to life,\r\nsuch as it is; let us resign ourselves to death; and let the\r\nresignation be cheerful or even gay. To spend ourselves in attempted\r\nreforms of the world, of society, of governments, is vain. The world\r\nwill go its own way; it is for us to accept things as they are, to\r\nobserve the laws of our country because it is ours, to smile at them\r\nif we please, and to extract our private gains from a view of the\r\nreformers, the enthusiasts, the dogmatists, the credulous, the\r\ncombatants; there is one heroism possible for us--the heroism of good\r\nsense. \"It is an absolute perfection, and as it were divine,\" so we\r\nread on the last page of Florio's translation of the _Essais_, \"for\r\na man to know how to enjoy his being loyally. We seek for other\r\nconditions because we understand not the use of ours; and go out of\r\nourselves, forasmuch as we know not what abiding there is. We may\r\nlong enough get upon stilts, for be we upon them, yet must we go with\r\nour legs. And sit we upon the highest throne of the world, yet sit\r\nwe upon our own tail. The best and most commendable lives, and best\r\npleasing me are (in my conceit), those which with order are fitted,\r\nand with decorum are ranged, to the common mould and human model;\r\nbut without wonder or extravagancy. Now hath old age need to be handled\r\nmore tenderly. Let us recommend it unto that God who is the protector\r\nof health and fountain of all wisdom; but blithe and social.\" And\r\nwith a stanza of Epicurean optimism from Horace the Essay closes.\r\n\r\nSuch, or somewhat after this fashion, is the doctrine of Montaigne.\r\nIt is conveyed to the reader without system, in the most informal\r\nmanner, in a series of discourses which seem to wander at their own\r\nwill, resembling a bright and easy conversation, vivid with imagery,\r\nenlivened by anecdote and citation, reminiscences from history,\r\nobservations of curious manners and customs, offering constantly to\r\nview the person of Montaigne himself in the easiest undress. The style,\r\nalthough really carefully studied and superintended, has an air of\r\nlight facility, hardly interposing between the author and his reader;\r\nthe book is of all books the most sociable, a living companion rather\r\nthan a book, playful and humorous, amiable and well bred, learned\r\nwithout pedantry, and wise without severity.\r\n\r\nDuring the last three years of his life Montaigne enjoyed the\r\nfriendship of a disciple who was already celebrated for his eloquence\r\nas a preacher. PIERRE CHARRON (1541-1603), legist and theologian,\r\nunder the influence of Montaigne's ideas, aspired to be a philosopher.\r\nIt was as a theologian that he wrote his book of the _Trois Verites_,\r\nwhich attempts to demonstrate the existence of God, the truth of\r\nChristianity, and the exclusive orthodoxy of the Roman communion.\r\nIt was as a philosopher, in the _Traite de la Sagesse_, that he\r\nsystematised the informal scepticism of Montaigne. Instead of\r\nputting the question, \"Que sais-je?\" Charron ventures the assertion,\r\n\"Je ne sais.\" He exhibits man's weakness, misery, and bondage to the\r\npassions; gives counsel for the enfranchisement of the mind; and\r\nstudies the virtues of justice, prudence, temperance, and valiance.\r\nGod has created man, says Charron, to know the truth; never can he\r\nknow it of himself or by human means, and one who despairs of reason\r\nis in the best position for accepting divine instruction; a Pyrrhonist\r\nat least will never be a heretic; even if religion be regarded as\r\nan invention of man, it is an invention which has its uses. Not a\r\nfew passages of the _Sagesse_ are directly borrowed, with slight\r\nrehandling, from Montaigne and from Du Vair; but, instead of\r\nMontaigne's smiling agnosticism, we have a grave and formal\r\nindictment of humanity; we miss the genial humour and kindly temper\r\nof the master; we miss the amiable egotism and the play of a versatile\r\nspirit; we miss the charm of an incomparable literary style.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE THIRD\r\n_THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\nLITERARY FREEDOM AND LITERARY ORDER\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the restoration of order under Henri IV. the delights of peace\r\nbegan to be felt; a mundane society, polished and pleasure-loving,\r\nbegan to be constituted, and before many years had passed the\r\ninfluence of women and of the _salon_ appeared in literature. Should\r\nsuch a society be permitted to remain oblivious to spiritual truth,\r\nor to repose on the pillow of scepticism provided by Charron and\r\nMontaigne? Might it not be captured for religion, if religion were\r\npresented in its most gracious aspect, as a source of peace and joy,\r\na gentle discipline of the heart? If one who wore the Christian armour\r\nshould throw over his steel some robe of courtly silk, with floral\r\nadornments, might he not prove a persuasive champion of the Cross?\r\nSuch was the hope of FRANCOIS DE SALES (1567-1622), Bishop of Geneva,\r\nwhen, in 1608, he published his _Introduction a la Vie Devote_. The\r\nangelic doctor charmed by his mere presence, his grace of person,\r\nhis winning smile, his dove's eyes; he showed how amiable piety might\r\nbe; his eloquence was festooned with blossoms; he strewed the path\r\nto heaven with roses; he conquered by docility; yet under his\r\nsweetness lay strength, and to methodise and popularise moral\r\nself-superintendence was to achieve much. The _Traite de l'Amour de\r\nDieu_ (1616), while it expounds the highest reaches of mystical\r\ndevotion, yet presents religion as accessible to every child of God.\r\nWith his tender and ardent devotion, something of a poet's sentiment\r\nfor nature was united; but mysticism and poetry were both subservient\r\nto his aim of regulating the conduct of the heart; he desired to show\r\nhow one may remain in the world, and yet not be of the world; by personal\r\nconverse and by his spiritual letters he became the director of\r\ncourtiers and of ladies. The motto of the literary Academy which he\r\nfounded at Annecy expresses his spirit--_flores fructusque\r\nperennes_--flowers for their own sake, but chiefly for the sake of\r\nfruit. Much of the genius for holiness of the courtly saint has passed\r\ninto the volume of reminiscences by Bishop Camus, his companion and\r\ndisciple--_l'Esprit de Saint Francois de Sales_.\r\n\r\nA mundane society, however, where fine gentlemen and ladies meet to\r\nadmire and be admired, needs other outlets for its imagination than\r\nthat of the primrose way to Paradise. The labour of the fields had\r\ninspired Olivier de Serres with the prose Georgics of his _Theatre\r\nd'Agriculture_, a work directed towards utility; the romance of the\r\nfields, and the pastoral, yet courtly, loves of a French Arcady, were\r\nthe inspiration of the endless prose bucolics found in the _Astree_\r\nof HONORE D'URFE. The Renaissance delight in the pastoral had passed\r\nfrom Italy to Spain; through the _Diana_ of the Spanish Montemayor\r\nit passed to France. After a period of turbulent strife there was\r\na fascination in visions of a peace, into which, if warfare entered,\r\nthe strange irruption only enhanced an habitual calm. A whole\r\ngeneration waited long to learn the issue of the passion of Celadon\r\nand Astree. The romance, of which the earliest part appeared in 1610,\r\nor earlier, was not completely published until 1627, when its author\r\nwas no longer living.[1] The scene is laid in the fields of d'Urfe's\r\nfamiliar Forez and on the banks of the Lignon; the time is of\r\nMerovingian antiquity. The shepherd Celadon, banished on suspicion\r\nof faithlessness from the presence of his beloved Astree, seeks death\r\nbeneath the stream; he is saved by the nymphs, escapes the amorous\r\npursuit of Galatea, assumes a feminine garb, and, protected by the\r\nDruid Adamas, has the felicity of daily beholding his shepherdess.\r\nAt length he declares himself, and is overwhelmed with reproaches;\r\ntrue lover that he is, when he offers his body to the devouring lions\r\nof the Fountain of Love, the beasts refuse their prey; the venerable\r\nDruid discreetly guides events; Celadon's fidelity receives its\r\nreward in marriage, and the banks of the Lignon become a scene of\r\nuniversal joy. The colours of the _Astree_ are faded now as those\r\nof some ancient tapestry, but during many years its success was\r\nprodigious. D'Urfe's highest honour, of many, is the confession of\r\nLa Fontaine:--\r\n\r\n   \"_Etant petit garcon je lisais son roman,\r\n    Et je le lis encore ayant la barbe grise._\"\r\n\r\nThe _Astree_ won its popularity, in part because it united the old\r\nattraction of a chivalric or heroic strain with that of the newer\r\npastoral; in part because it idealised the gallantries and developed\r\nthe amorous casuistry of the day, not without a real sense of the\r\npower of love; in part because it was supposed to exhibit ideal\r\nportraits of distinguished contemporaries. It was the parent of a\r\nnumerous progeny; and as the heroic romance of the seventeenth century\r\nis derived in direct succession from the loves of Celadon and Astree,\r\nso the comic romance, beside all that it owes to the tradition of\r\nthe _esprit gaulois_, owes something to the mocking gaiety with which\r\nd'Urfe exhibits the adventures and emotional vicissitudes of his\r\ninconstant shepherd Hylas.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It should be noted that the close of the _Astree_ is\r\nby D'Urfe's secretary Baro.]\r\n\r\nIn the political and social reconstruction which followed the civil\r\nand religious wars, the need of discipline and order in literature\r\nwas felt; in this province, also, unity under a law was seen to be\r\ndesirable. The work of the Pleiade had in a great measure failed;\r\nthey had attempted to organise poetry and its methods, and poetry\r\nwas still disorganised. To reduce the realm of caprice and fantasy\r\nto obedience to law was the work of FRANCOIS DE MALHERBE. Born at\r\nCaen in 1555, he had published in 1587 his _Larmes de Saint Pierre_,\r\nan imitation of the Italian poem by Tansillo, in a manner which his\r\nmaturer judgment must have condemned. It was not until about his\r\nfortieth year that he found his true direction. Du Vair, with whom\r\nhe was acquainted, probably led him to a true conception of the nature\r\nof eloquence. Vigorous of character, clear in understanding, with\r\nno affluence of imagination and no excess of sensibility, Malherbe\r\nwas well qualified for establishing lyrical poetry upon the basis\r\nof reason, and of general rather than individual sentiment. He chose\r\nthe themes of his odes from topics of public interest, or founded\r\nthem on those commonplaces of emotion which are part of the possession\r\nof all men who think and feel. If he composed his verses for some\r\ngreat occasion, he sought for no curiosities of a private imagination,\r\nbut considered in what way its nobler aspects ought to be regarded\r\nby the community at large; if he consoled a friend for losses caused\r\nby death, he held his personal passion under restraint; he generalised,\r\nand was content to utter more admirably than others the accepted\r\ntruths about the brevity and beauty of life, and the inevitable doom\r\nof death. What he gained by such a process of abstraction, he lost\r\nin vivid characterisation; his imagery lacks colour; the movement\r\nof his verse is deliberate and calculated; his ideas are rigorously\r\nenchained one to another.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that poetry--the overflow of individual emotion--is\r\noverheard; while oratory--the appeal to an audience--is heard. The\r\nprocesses of Malherbe's art were essentially oratorical; the lyrical\r\ncry is seldom audible in his verse; it is the poetry of eloquence\r\nthrown into studied stanzas. But the greater poetry of the seventeenth\r\ncentury in France--its odes, its satires, its epistles, its noble\r\ndramatic scenes--and much of its prose literature are of the nature\r\nof oratory; and for the progress of such poetry, and even of such\r\nprose, Malherbe prepared a highway. He aimed at a reformation of the\r\nlanguage, which, rejecting all words either base, provincial,\r\narchaic, technical, or over-learned and over-curious, should employ\r\nthe standard French, pure and dignified, as accepted by the people\r\nof Paris. In his hands language became too exclusively an instrument\r\nof the intelligence; yet with this instrument great things were\r\nachieved by his successors. He methodised and regulated\r\nversification, insisting on rich and exact rhymes, condemning all\r\nlicence and infirmity of structure, condemning harshness of sound,\r\ninversion, hiatus, negligence in accommodating the cesura to the\r\nsense, the free gliding of couplet into couplet. It may be said that\r\nhe rendered verse mechanical; but within the arrangement which he\r\nprescribed, admirable effects were attainable by the mastery of\r\ngenius. He pondered every word, weighed every syllable, and thought\r\nno pains ill-spent if only clearness, precision, the logic of\r\nordonnance, a sustained harmony were at length secured; and until\r\nthe day of his death, in 1628, no decline in his art can be perceived.\r\n\r\nMalherbe fell far short of being a great poet, but in the history\r\nof seventeenth-century classicism, in the effort of the age to\r\nrationalise the forms of art, his name is of capital importance. It\r\ncannot be said that he founded a school. His immediate disciples,\r\nMAYNARD and RACAN, failed to develop the movement which he had\r\ninitiated. Maynard laid verse by the side of verse with exact care,\r\nand sometimes one or the other verse is excellent, but he lacked\r\nsustained force and flight. Racan had genuine inspiration; a true\r\nfeeling for nature appears in his dramatic pastoral, the _Bergeries_\r\n(1625); unhappily he had neither the culture nor the patience needed\r\nfor perfect execution; he was rather an admirable amateur than an\r\nartist. But if Malherbe founded no school, he gave an eminent example,\r\nand the argument which he maintained in the cause of poetic art was\r\nat a later time carried to its conclusion by Boileau.\r\n\r\nMalherbe's reform was not accepted without opposition. While he\r\npleaded for the supremacy of order, regularity, law, the voice of\r\nMATHURIN REGNIER (1573-1613) was heard on behalf of freedom. A nephew\r\nof the poet Desportes, Regnier was loyal to his uncle's fame and to\r\nthe memory of the Pleiade; if Malherbe spoke slightingly of Desportes,\r\nand cast aside the tradition of the school of Ronsard, the retort\r\nwas speedy and telling against the arrogant reformer, tyrant of words\r\nand syllables, all whose achievement amounted to no more than _proser\r\nde la rime et rimer de la prose_. Unawares, indeed, Regnier, to a\r\ncertain extent, co-operated with Malherbe, who recognised the genius\r\nof his younger adversary; he turned away from languid elegances to\r\nobservation of life and truth of feeling; if he imitated his masters\r\nHorace and Ovid, or the Italian satiric poets, with whose writings\r\nhe had become acquainted during two periods of residence in Rome,\r\nhis imitations were not obsequious, like those of the Pleiade, but\r\nvigorous and original, like those of Boileau; in his sense of comedy\r\nhe anticipates some of Moliere's feeling for the humorous\r\nperversities of human character; his language is vivid, plain, and\r\npopular. The classical school of later years could not reject Regnier.\r\nBoileau declared that no poet before Moliere was so well acquainted\r\nwith the manners and characters of men; through his impersonal study\r\nof life he is indeed classic. But his ardent nature rebelled against\r\nformal rule; he trusted to the native force of genius, and let his\r\nideas and passions lead him where they would. His satires are those\r\nof a painter whose eye is on his object, and who handles his brush\r\nwith a vigorous discretion; they are criticisms of society and its\r\ntypes of folly or of vice, full of force and colour, yet general in\r\ntheir intention, for, except at the poet who had affronted his uncle,\r\n\"le bon Regnier\" struck at no individual. Most admirable, amid much\r\nthat is admirable, is the picture of the old worldling Macette, whose\r\nveil of pretended piety is gradually dropped as she discourses with\r\ngrowing wantonness to the maiden whom she would lead in the way she\r\nshould not go: Macette is no unworthy elder of the family of Tartufe.\r\nRegnier confesses freely the passions of his own irregular life; had\r\nit been wisely conducted, his genius might have carried him far; as\r\nit was, he passed away prematurely at the age of forty, the victim\r\nof his own intemperate pursuit of pleasure.\r\n\r\nStill more unfortunate was the life of a younger poet, who, while\r\nhonouring the genius of Malherbe, pronounced, like Regnier, for\r\nfreedom rather than order, and maintained that each writer of genius\r\nshould be a law to himself--a poet whom his contemporaries esteemed\r\ntoo highly, and whom Malherbe, and afterwards Boileau, unjustly\r\ndepreciated--THEOPHILE DE VIAU. A Huguenot who had abjured his faith,\r\nafterwards pursued as a libertine in conduct and as a freethinker,\r\nTheophile was hunted, imprisoned, exiled, condemned to execution,\r\nand died exhausted in 1626, when only six-and-thirty years old. He\r\nhas been described as the last lyrical poet of his age, and the first\r\nof the poetical exponents of the new preciosity. His dramatic _Pyrame\r\net Thisbe_, though disfigured by those _concetti_ which the Italian\r\nMarini--an honoured guest at the French court--and the invasion of\r\nSpanish tastes had made the mode, is not without touches of genuine\r\npathos. The odes of Theophile are of free and musical movement, his\r\ndescriptions of natural beauty are graciously coloured, his judgment\r\nin literary matters was sound and original; but he lacked the patient\r\nworkmanship which art demands, and in proclaiming himself on the side\r\nof freedom as against order, he was retrograding from the position\r\nwhich had been secured for poetry under the leadership of Malherbe.\r\n\r\nWith social order came the desire for social refinement, and following\r\nthe desire for refinement came the prettinesses and affectations of\r\nover-curious elegance. Peace returned to France with the monarchy\r\nof Henri IV., but the Gascon manners of his court were rude. Catherine\r\nde Vivonne, Marquise de Rambouillet, whose mother was a great Roman\r\nlady, and whose father had been French ambassador at Rome, young,\r\nbeautiful, delicately nurtured, retired in 1608 from the court, and\r\na few years later opened her _salon_ of the Hotel de Rambouillet to\r\nsuch noble and cultivated persons as were willing to be the courtiers\r\nof womanly grace and wit and taste. The rooms were arranged and\r\ndecorated for the purposes of pleasure; the _chambre bleue_ became\r\nthe sanctuary of polite society, where Arthenice (an anagram for\r\n\"Catherine\") was the high priestess. To dance, to sing, to touch the\r\nlute was well; to converse with wit and refinement was something more\r\nadmirable; the _salon_ became a mart for the exchange of ideas; the\r\nfashion of Spain was added to the fashion of Italy; Platonism,\r\nPetrarchism, Marinism, Gongorism, the spirit of romance and the\r\ndaintinesses of learning and of pedantry met and mingled. Hither came\r\nMalherbe, Racan, Chapelain, Vaugelas; at a later time Balzac, Segrais,\r\nVoiture, Godeau; and again, towards the mid-years of the century,\r\nSaint-Evremond and La Rochefoucauld. Here Corneille read his plays\r\nfrom the _Cid_ to _Rodogune_; here Bossuet, a marvellous boy,\r\nimprovised a midnight discourse, and Voiture declared he had never\r\nheard one preach so early or so late.\r\n\r\nAs Julie d'Angennes and her sister Angelique attained an age to divide\r\ntheir mother's authority in the _salon_, its sentiment grew\r\nquintessential, and its taste was subtilised well-nigh to inanity.\r\nThey censured _Polyeucte_; they found Chapelain's unhappy epic\r\n\"perfectly beautiful, but excessively tiresome\"; they laid their\r\nheads together over Descartes' _Discours de la Methode_, and\r\nprofoundly admired the philosopher; they were enraptured by the\r\nmadrigals on flowers, more than three score in number, offered as\r\nthe _Guirlande de Julie_ on Mademoiselle's fete; they gravely debated\r\nthe question which should be the approved spelling, _muscadin_ or\r\n_muscardin_. In 1649 they were sundered into rival parties--_Uranistes_\r\nand _Jobelins_--tilting in literary lists on behalf of the respective\r\nmerits of a sonnet by Voiture and a sonnet by Benserade. The word\r\n_precieux_ is said to date from 1650. The Marquise de Rambouillet\r\nsurvived Moliere's satiric comedy _Les Precieuses Ridicules_ (1659) by\r\nseveral years. Mme. de Sevigne, Mme. de la Fayette, Flechier, the\r\npreacher of fashion, were among the illustrious personages of the\r\ndecline of her _salon_. We smile at its follies and affectations; but,\r\nwhile it harmed literature by magnifying things that were petty, it did\r\nsomething to refine manners, to quicken ideas, to encourage clearness\r\nand grace of expression, and to make the pursuit of letters an avenue\r\nto social distinction. Through the Hotel de Rambouillet, and the\r\n_salons_ which both in Paris and the provinces imitated its modes, and\r\npushed them to extravagance, the influence of women on literature\r\nbecame a power for good and for evil.\r\n\r\nThe \"Works,\" as they were styled, of VINCENT VOITURE\r\n(1598-1648)--posthumously published--represent one side of the\r\nspirit of the _salon_. Capable of something higher, he lived to\r\nexhibit his ingenuity and wit in little ways, now by a cleverly-turned\r\nverse, now by a letter of gallantry. Although of humble origin, he\r\nwas for long a presiding genius in the _chambre bleue_ of Arthenice.\r\nHis play of mind was unhappily without a subject, and to be witty\r\non nothings puts a strain on wit. Voiture expends much labour on being\r\nlight, much serious effort in attaining vanities. His letters were\r\nadmired as models of ingenious elegance; the life has long since\r\npassed from their raillery and badinage, but Voiture may be credited\r\nwith having helped to render French prose pliant for the uses of\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nThe dainty trifles of the school of preciosity fluttered at least\r\nduring the sunshine of a day. Its ambitious epics, whatever attention\r\nthey may have attracted in their time, cannot be said to have ever\r\npossessed real life. The great style is not to be attained by tagging\r\nplatitudes with points. The _Saint Louis_ of Lemoyne, the _Clovis_\r\nof Desmarets de Saint-Sorlin, the _Alaric_ of Scudery, the\r\n_Charlemagne_ of Louis le Laboureur remain only as evidences of the\r\nvanity of misplaced ambition. During twenty years JEAN CHAPELAIN,\r\na man of no mean ability in other fields, was occupied with his _La\r\nPucelle d'Orleans_; twelve cantos at length appeared magnificently\r\nin 1656, and won a brief applause; the remaining twelve cantos lie\r\nstill inedited. The matter of history was too humble for Chapelain's\r\ngenius; history is ennobled by an allegorical intention; France\r\nbecomes the soul of man; Charles, swayed between good and evil, is\r\nthe human will; the Maid of Orleans is divine grace. The satire of\r\nBoileau, just in its severity, was hardly needed to slay the slain.\r\n\r\nIn the prose romances, which are epics emancipated from the trammels\r\nof verse, there was more vitality. Bishop Camus, the friend of\r\nFrancois de Sales, had attempted to sanctify the movement which d'Urfe\r\nhad initiated; but the spirit of the _Astree_ would not unite in a\r\nsingle stream with the spirit of the _Introduction a la Vie Devote_.\r\nGomberville is remembered rather for the remorseless war which he\r\nwaged against the innocent conjunction _car_, never to be admitted\r\ninto polite literature, than for his encyclopaedic romance\r\n_Polexandre_, in which geography is illustrated by fiction, as\r\ncopious as it is fantastic; yet it was something to annex for the\r\nfirst time the ocean, with all its marvels, to the scenery of adventure.\r\nGombauld, the _Beau Tenebreux_ of the Hotel de Rambouillet, secured\r\na reading for his unreadable _Endymion_ by the supposed transparence\r\nof his allusions to living persons. Desmarets de Saint-Sorlin\r\nrelieved the amorous exaltations of his _Ariane_, a tale of the time\r\nof Nero, by excursions which touch the borders of comedy. These are\r\nbooks on which the dust gathers thick in ancient libraries.\r\n\r\nBut the romances of LA CALPRENEDE and of GEORGES and MADELEINE DE\r\nSCUDERY might well be taken down by any lover of literature who\r\npossesses the virtue of fortitude. Since d'Urfe's day the taste for\r\npastoral had declined; the newer romance was gallant and heroic.\r\nLegend or history supplied its framework; but the central motive was\r\nideal love at odds with circumstance, love the inspirer of limitless\r\ndevotion and daring. The art of construction was imperfectly\r\nunderstood; the narratives are of portentous length; ten, twelve,\r\ntwenty volumes were needed to deploy the sentiments and the adventures.\r\nIn _Cassandre_, in _Cleopatre_, in _Pharamond_, La Calprenede\r\nexhibits a kind of universal history; the dissolution of the\r\nMacedonian empire, the decline of the empire of Rome, the beginnings\r\nof the French monarchy are successively presented. But the chief\r\npersonages are idealised portraits drawn from the society of the\r\nauthor's time. The spirit of the Hotel de Rambouillet is transferred\r\nto the period when the Scythian Oroondate was the lover of Statira,\r\ndaughter of Darius; the Prince de Conde masks in _Cleopatre_ as\r\nCoriolan; Pharamond is the Grand Monarch in disguise. Notwithstanding\r\nthe faded gallantries and amorous casuistry of La Calprenede's\r\ninterminable romances, a certain spirit of real heroism, offspring of\r\nthe writer's ardent imagination and bright southern temper, breathes\r\nthrough them. They were the delight of Mme. de Sevigne and of La\r\nFontaine; even in the eighteenth century they were the companions of\r\nCrebillon, and were not forgotten by Rousseau.\r\n\r\nStill more popular was _Artamene, ou le Grand Cyrus_. Mdlle. de\r\nScudery, the \"Sapho\" of her Saturday _salon_, a true _precieuse_,\r\nas good of heart and quick of wit as she was unprepossessing of person,\r\nsupplied the sentiment and metaphysics of love to match the\r\ngasconading exploits of her brother's invention. It was the time not\r\nonly of preciosity, but of the Fronde, with its turbulent adventures\r\nand fantastic chivalry. Under the names of Medes and Persians could\r\nbe discovered the adventurers, the gallants, the fine ladies of the\r\nseventeenth century. In _Clelie_ an attempt is made to study the\r\ncuriosities of passion; it is a manual of polite love and elegant\r\nmanners; in its _carte de Tendre_ we can examine the topography of\r\nlove-land, trace the routes to the three cities of \"Tendre,\" and learn\r\nthe dangers of the way. Thus the heroic romance reached its term;\r\nits finer spirit became the possession of the tragic drama, where\r\nit was purified and rendered sane. The modern novel had wandered in\r\nsearch of its true self, and had not succeeded in the quest. When\r\n_Gil Blas_ appeared, it was seen that the novel of incident must also\r\nbe the novel of character, and that in its imitation of real life\r\nit could appropriate some of the possessions which by that time comedy\r\nhad lost.\r\n\r\nThe extravagances of sentiment produced a natural reaction. Not a\r\nfew of the intimates of the Hotel de Rambouillet found a relief from\r\ntheir fatigue of fine manners and high-pitched emotions in the\r\nunedifying jests and merry tales of the tavern. A comic, convivial,\r\nburlesque or picaresque literature became, as it were, a parody of\r\nthe literature of preciosity. Saint-Amand (1594-1661) was at once\r\na disciple of the Italian Marini, the admired \"Sapurnius\" of the\r\n_salon_, author of at least one beautiful ode--_La Solitude_--breathing\r\na gentle melancholy, and a gay singer of bacchic chants. Desmarets de\r\nSaint-Sorlin, in his comedy _Les Visionnaires_ (1637), mocked the\r\n_precieuses_, and was applauded by the spectators of the theatre. One\r\nof his heroines is hopelessly enamoured of Alexander the Great; one is\r\nenamoured of poetry, and sees life as if it were material for the\r\nstage; and the third is enamoured of her own beauty, with its imagined\r\npotency over the hearts of men. As early as 1622 CHARLES SOREL\r\nexpressed, in his _Histoire Comique de Francion_, a Rabelaisian and\r\npicaresque tale of low life, the revolt of the _esprit gaulois_ against\r\nthe homage of the imagination to courtly shepherdesses and pastoral\r\ncavaliers. It was reprinted more than forty times. In _Le Berger\r\nExtravagant_ (1628) he attempted a kind of Don Quixote for his own\r\nday--an \"anti-romance\"--which recounts the pastoral follies of a young\r\nParisian bourgeois, whose wits have been set wandering by such dreams\r\nas the _Astree_ had inspired; its mirth is unhappily overloaded with\r\npedantry.\r\n\r\nThe master of this school of seventeenth-century realism was PAUL\r\nSCARRON (1610-60), the comely little abbe, unconcerned with\r\necclesiastical scruples or good manners, who, when a paralytic,\r\ntwisted and tortured by disease, became the husband of D'Aubigne's\r\ngranddaughter, destined as Madame de Maintenon to become the most\r\ninfluential woman in all the history of France. In his _Virgile\r\nTravesti_ he produced a vulgar counterpart to the heroic epics, which\r\ntheir own dead-weight would have speedily enough borne downwards to\r\noblivion. His _Roman Comique_ (1651), a short and lively narrative\r\nof the adventures of a troupe of comedians strolling in the provinces,\r\ncontrasted with the exaltations, the heroisms, the delicate\r\ndistresses of the ideal romance. The _Roman Bourgeois_ (1666) of\r\nANTOINE FURETIERE is a belated example of the group to which\r\n_Francion_ belongs. The great event of its author's life was his\r\nexclusion from the Academy, of which he was a member, on the ground\r\nthat he had appropriated for the advantage of his Dictionary the\r\nresults of his fellow-members' researches for the Dictionary, then\r\nin progress, of the learned company. His _Roman_ is a remarkable study\r\nof certain types of middle-class Parisian life, often animated, exact,\r\neffective in its satire; but the analysis of a petty and commonplace\r\nworld needs some relief of beauty or generosity to make its triviality\r\nacceptable, and such relief Furetiere will not afford.\r\n\r\nSomewhat apart from this group of satiric tales, yet with a certain\r\nkinship to them, lie the more fantastic satires of that fiery\r\nswashbuckler--\"demon des braves\"--CYRANO DE BERGERAC (1619-55),\r\n_Histoire Comique des Etats et Empires de la Lune_, and _Histoire\r\nComique des Etats et Empires du Soleil_. Cyrano's taste, caught by\r\nthe mannerisms of Italy and extravagances of Spain, was execrable.\r\nTo his violences of temper he added a reputation for irreligion. His\r\ncomedy _Le Pedant Joue_ has the honour of having furnished Moliere\r\nwith the most laughable scene of the _Fourberies de Scapin_. The\r\nvoyages to the moon and the sun, in which the inhabitants, their\r\nmanners, governments, and ideas, are presented, mingle audacities\r\nand caprices of invention with a portion of satiric truth; they lived\r\nin the memories of the creator of Gulliver and the creator of\r\nMicromegas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\nTHE FRENCH ACADEMY--PHILOSOPHY (DESCARTES)--RELIGION (PASCAL)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe French Academy, an organised aristocracy of letters, expressed\r\nthe growing sense that anarchy in literature must end, and that\r\ndiscipline and law must be recognised in things of the mind. It is\r\none of the glories of RICHELIEU that he perceived that literature\r\nhas a public function, and may indeed be regarded as an affair of\r\nthe State. His own writings, or those composed under his\r\ndirection--memoirs; letters; the _Succincte Narration_, which sets\r\nforth his policy; the _Testament_, which embodies his counsel in\r\nstatecraft--belong less to literature than to French history. But\r\nhe honoured the literary art; he enjoyed the drama; he devised plots\r\nfor plays, and found docile poets--his Society of five--to carry out\r\nhis designs.\r\n\r\nIn 1629 Valentin Conrart, secretary to the King, and one of the\r\nfrequenters of the Hotel de Rambouillet, was accustomed to receive\r\nweekly a group of distinguished men of letters and literary amateurs,\r\nwho read their manuscripts aloud, discussed the merits of new works,\r\nand considered questions of criticism, grammar, and language.\r\nTidings of these reunions having reached Richelieu, he proposed that\r\nthe society should receive an official status. By the influence of\r\nChapelain the objections of certain members were overcome. The\r\n_Academie Francaise_ held its first sitting on March 13, 1634; three\r\nyears later the letters patent were registered; the number of members\r\nwas fixed at forty; when vacancies occurred, new members were co-opted\r\nfor life. Its history to the year 1652 was published in the following\r\nyear by Pellisson, and obtained him admission to a chair. The\r\nfunctions of the learned company were to ascertain, as far as possible,\r\nthe French language, to regulate grammar, and to act as a literary\r\ntribunal if members consented to submit their works to its examination.\r\nThere were hopes that authoritative treatises on rhetoric and poetics\r\nmight be issued with its sanction; but these hopes were not fulfilled.\r\nA dictionary, of which Chapelain presented the plan in 1638, was,\r\nhowever, undertaken; progressing by slow degrees, the first edition\r\nappeared in 1694. Its aim was not to record every word of which an\r\nexample could be found, but to select those approved by the usage\r\nof cultivated society and of the best contemporary or recent authors.\r\nThus it tended to establish for literary use an aristocracy of words;\r\nand while literary expression gained in dignity and intellectual\r\nprecision, gained as an instrument of reason and analysis, such\r\nregulation created a danger that it might lose in elements that have\r\naffinities with the popular mind--vivacity, colour, picturesqueness,\r\nvariety. At its commencement no one was more deeply interested in\r\nthe dictionary than Vaugelas (1585-1650), a gentleman of Savoie,\r\nwhose concern for the purity of the language, as determined by the\r\nbest usage, led him to resist innovations and the invasion of foreign\r\nphraseology. His _Remarques sur la Langue Francaise_ served as a guide\r\nto his fellow-members of the Academy. Unhappily he was wholly ignorant\r\nof the history of the language. With the erudite Chapelain he mediated\r\nbetween the scholarship and the polite society of the time. But while\r\nVaugelas was almost wholly occupied with the vocabulary and grammar,\r\nChapelain did much to enforce the principles of the classical school\r\nupon literary art. The Academy took up the work which the _salons_\r\nhad begun; its spirit was more robust and masculine than theirs; it\r\nwas freer from passing fashions, affectations, prettinesses; it\r\nleaned on the side of intellect rather than of sentiment.\r\n\r\nIn what may be called the regulation of French prose the influence\r\nof JEAN-LOUIS GUEZ DE BALZAC (1594-1654) was considerable. He had\r\nlearnt from Malherbe that a literary craftsman should leave nothing\r\nto chance, that every effect should be exactly calculated. It was\r\nhis task to apply to prose the principles which had guided his master\r\nin verse. His _Lettres_, of which a first series appeared in 1624,\r\nand a second twelve years later, are not the spontaneous intercourse\r\nof friend with friend, but rather studious compositions which deal\r\nwith matters of learning, literature, morals, religion, politics,\r\nevents, and persons of the time. Their contents are of little\r\nimportance; Balzac was not an original thinker, but he had the art\r\nof arranging his ideas, and of expressing them in chosen words\r\nmarshalled in ample and sonorous sentences. A certain fire he had,\r\na limited power of imagination, a cultivated judgment, a taste, which\r\nsuffered from bad workmanship; a true affection for rural life. These\r\nhardly furnished him with matter adequate to support his elevated\r\nstyle. His letters were regarded as models of eloquence; but it is\r\neloquence manufactured artificially and applied to subjects, not\r\nproceeding from them. His _Prince_, a treatise on the virtues of kings,\r\nwith a special reference to Louis XIII., was received coldly. His\r\n_Aristippe_, which dealt with the manners and morals of a court, and\r\nhis _Socrate Chretien_, a study in ethics and theology, were efforts\r\nbeyond his powers. His gift to literature was a gift of method and\r\nof style; others who worked in marble learned something from his\r\nstudious modellings in clay.\r\n\r\nTo regulate thought required an intellect of a different order from\r\nthat of Balzac, \"emperor of orators.\" It was the task of RENE DESCARTES\r\n(1596-1650). A child of delicate health, born at La Haye, near Tours,\r\nhe became, under Jesuit teachers, a precocious student both in\r\nlanguages and science. But truth, not erudition, was the demand and\r\nthe necessity of his mind. Solitary investigations in mathematics\r\nwere for a time succeeded by the life of a soldier in the Netherlands\r\nand Holland. The stream of thought was flowing, however, underground.\r\nSuddenly it emerged to light. In 1619, when the young volunteer was\r\nin winter quarters at Neuburg, on the Danube, on a memorable day the\r\nfirst principles of a new philosophical method presented themselves\r\nto his intellect, and, as it were, claimed him for their interpreter.\r\nAfter wanderings through various parts of Europe, and a period of\r\nstudious leisure in Paris, he chose Holland for his place of abode\r\n(1629), and though often shifting his residence, little disturbed\r\nsave by the controversies of philosophy and the orthodox zeal of Dutch\r\ntheologians, he gave his best hours during twenty years to thought.\r\nAn invitation from Queen Christina to the Swedish court was accepted\r\nin 1649. The change in his habits and the severity of a northern winter\r\nproved fatal to the health which Descartes had carefully cherished;\r\nin February of 1650 he was dead.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical cycle in the development of Descartes' system of\r\nthought preceded the metaphysical. His great achievements in\r\nanalytical geometry, in optics, in physical research, his\r\nexplanation of the laws of nature, and their application in his theory\r\nof the material universe, belong to the history of science. Algebra\r\nand geometry led him towards his method in metaphysical speculation.\r\nHow do all primary truths verify themselves to the human mind? By\r\nthe fact that an object is clearly and distinctly conceived. The\r\nobjects of knowledge fall into certain groups or series; in each\r\nseries there is some simple and dominant element which may be\r\nimmediately apprehended, and in relation to which the subordinate\r\nelements become intelligible. Let us accept nothing on hearsay or\r\nauthority; let us start with doubt in order to arrive at certitude;\r\nlet us test the criterion of certitude to the uttermost. There is\r\none fact which I cannot doubt, even in doubting all--I think, and\r\nif I think, I exist--\"Je pense, donc je suis.\" No other evidence of\r\nthis is needed than that our conception is clear and distinct; in\r\nthis clearness and distinctness we find the principle of certitude.\r\nMind, then, exists, and is known to us as a thinking substance. But\r\nthe idea of an infinite, perfect Being is also present to our\r\nintellect; we, finite, imperfect beings, could not have made it;\r\nunmake it we cannot; and in the conception of perfection that of\r\nexistence is involved. Therefore God exists, and therefore the laws\r\nof our consciousness, which are His laws, cannot deceive us. We have\r\nseen what mind or spirit signifies--a thinking substance. Reduce our\r\nidea of matter to clearness and distinctness, and what do we find?\r\nThe idea of an extended substance. Our complex humanity, made up of\r\nsoul and body, comprises both kinds of substance. But thought and\r\nextension have nothing in common; their union can only be conceived\r\nas the collocation at a single point of a machine with that which\r\nraises it above a mere machine. As for the lower animals, they are\r\nno more than automata.\r\n\r\nDescartes' _Principia_ and his _Meditationes_ were written in Latin.\r\nThe _Discours de la Methode_ (1637) and the later _Traite des\r\nPassions_ showed how the French language could be adapted to the\r\npurposes of the reason. Such eloquence as is found in Descartes is\r\nthat of thought illuminating style. The theory of the passions\r\nanticipates some of the tendencies of modern psychology in its\r\nphysical investigations. No one, however, affirmed more absolutely\r\nthan Descartes the freedom of the will--unless, indeed, we regard\r\nit as determined by God: it cannot directly control the passions,\r\nbut it can indirectly modify them with the aid of imagination; it\r\nis the supreme mistress of action, however the passions may oppose\r\nits fiat. Spiritualist as he was, Descartes was not disposed to be\r\nthe martyr of thought. Warned by the example of Galileo, he did not\r\ndesire to expose himself to the dangers attending heretical opinions.\r\nHe separated the province of faith from that of reason: \"I revere\r\nour theology,\" he said; but he held that theology demanded other\r\nlights than those of the unaided powers of man. In its own province,\r\nhe made the reason his absolute guide, and with results which\r\ntheologians might regard as dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of Descartes' work was in harmony with that of his time,\r\nand reacted upon literature. He sought for general truths by the light\r\nof reason; he made clearness a criterion of truth; he proclaimed man\r\na spirit; he asserted the freedom of the will. The art of the classical\r\nperiod sought also for general truths, and subordinated imagination\r\nto reason. It turned away from ingenuities, obscurities, mysteries;\r\nit was essentially spiritualist; it represented the crises and heroic\r\nvictories of the will.\r\n\r\nDescartes' opponent, Pierre Gassendi (1592-1655), epicurean in his\r\nphysics, an empiricist, though an inconsistent one, in philosophy,\r\nchose the Latin language as the vehicle for his ideas. A group of\r\nwriters whose tendencies were towards sensualism or scepticism,\r\nviewed him as their master. Chapelle in verse, La Mothe le Vayer in\r\nprose, may serve as representatives of art surrendering itself to\r\nvulgar pleasures, and thought doubting even its doubts, and finding\r\nrepose in indifference.\r\n\r\nThe true successor of Descartes in French philosophy, eminent in the\r\nsecond half of the century, was NICOLAS DE MALEBRANCHE (1638-1715).\r\nSoul and body, Descartes had shown, are in their very nature alien\r\neach from the other. How then does the soul attain a knowledge of\r\nthe external world? In God, the absolute substance, are the ideas\r\nof all things; in God we behold those ideas which matter could never\r\nconvey to us, and which we could never ourselves originate; in God\r\nwe see and know all things. The _Recherche de la Verite_ (1674-75)\r\nwas admirably written and was widely read. The theologians found it\r\ndangerous; and when six years later Malebranche published his _Traite\r\nde la Nature et de la Grace_, characterised briefly and decidedly\r\nby Bossuet as \"pulchra, nova, falsa,\" at Bossuet's request both\r\nArnauld and Fenelon attempted to refute \"the extravagant Oratorian.\"\r\nHis place in the evolution of philosophy lies between Descartes and\r\nSpinoza, who developed and completed the doctrine of Descartes. In\r\nthe transition from dualism to monism Malebranche served as a\r\nmediator.\r\n\r\nReligious thought in the seventeenth century, wedded to an austere\r\nmorality, is expressed by the writers of Port-Royal, and those who\r\nwere in sympathy with them. They could not follow the flowery path\r\nof piety--not the less the narrow path because it was cheerful--pointed\r\nout by St. Francois de Sales. Between nature and grace they saw a deep\r\nand wide abyss. In closest connection with them was one man of the\r\nhighest genius--author of the _Provinciales_ and the _Pensees_--whose\r\nspiritual history was more dramatic than any miracle-play or morality\r\nof the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nBLAISE PASCAL was born at Clermont-Ferrand in 1623. His father, a\r\npresident of the Court of Aids at Clermont, a man of intellect and\r\ncharacter, guided his education in languages, natural science, and\r\nmathematics. The boy's precocity was extraordinary; at sixteen he\r\nhad written a treatise on Conic Sections, which excited the\r\nastonishment of Descartes. But the intensity of study, preying upon\r\na nervous constitution, consumed his health and strength; at an early\r\nage he suffered from temporary paralysis. When about twenty-three\r\nhe fell under the religious influences of certain disciples of St.\r\nCyran, read eagerly in the writings of Jansen and Arnauld, and\r\nresolved to live for God alone. But to restore his health he was urged\r\nto seek recreation, and by degrees the interests and pleasures of\r\nthe world took hold upon him; the master of his mind was the sceptical\r\nMontaigne; he moved in the mundane society of the capital; and it\r\nhas been conjectured from hints in his _Discours sur les Passions\r\nde l'Amour_ that he loved the sister of his friend, the Duc de Roannez,\r\nand had the vain hope of making her his wife.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of religion, however, lived within his heart, and needed\r\nonly to be reawakened. The reawakening came in 1654 through the\r\npersuasions of his sister, Jacqueline, who had abandoned the world\r\ntwo years previously, and entered the community of Port-Royal. The\r\nabbey of Port-Royal, situated some seven or eight miles from\r\nVersailles, was presided over by Jacqueline Arnauld, the Mere\r\nAngelique, and a brotherhood of solitaries, among whom were several\r\nof the Arnauld family, had settled in the valley in the year 1637.\r\nWith this unvowed brotherhood Pascal, though never actually a\r\nsolitary, associated himself at the close of 1654. An escape from\r\nsudden danger in a carriage accident, and a vision or ecstasy which\r\ncame to him, co-operated in his conversion. After his death, copies\r\nof a fragmentary and passionate writing referring to this period--the\r\nso-called \"amulet\" of Pascal--were found upon his person; its words,\r\n\"renonciation totale et douce,\" and \"joie, joie, joie, pleurs de\r\njoie,\" express something of his resolution and his rapture.\r\n\r\nThe affair of the _Provinciales_, and the design of an apology for\r\nChristianity with which his _Pensees_ are connected, together with\r\ncertain scientific studies and the deepening passion of religion,\r\nmake up what remained of Pascal's life. His spirit grew austere, but\r\nin his austerity there was an inexpressible joy. Exhausted by his\r\nascetic practices and the inward flame of his soul, Pascal died on\r\nAugust 19, 1662. \"May God never leave me\" were his last words.\r\n\r\nWith Pascal's work as a mathematician and a physicist we are not here\r\nconcerned. In it \"we see,\" writes a scientific authority, \"the\r\nstrongest marks of a great original genius creating new ideas, and\r\nseizing upon, mastering, and pursuing further everything that was\r\nfresh and unfamiliar in his time. After the lapse of more than two\r\nhundred years, we can still point to much in exact science that is\r\nabsolutely his; and we can indicate infinitely more which is due to\r\nhis inspiration.\"\r\n\r\nJansenism and Jesuitism, opposed as they were, have this in common,\r\nthat both were movements in that revival of Roman Catholicism which\r\nwas stimulated by the rivalry of the Protestant Reformation. But the\r\nJesuits sought to win the world to religion by an art of piety, in\r\nwhich a system of accommodation was recognised as a means of drawing\r\nworldlings to the Church; the Jansenists held up a severe moral ideal,\r\nand humbled human nature in presence of the absolute need and\r\nresistless omnipotence of divine grace. Like the Jesuits, but in a\r\ndifferent spirit, the Port-Royalists devoted themselves much to the\r\ntask of education. They honoured classical studies; they honoured\r\nscience, dialectics, philosophy. Their grammar, logic, geometry were\r\nsubstantial additions to the literature of pedagogy. Isaac le Maistre\r\nde Sacy and others translated and annotated the Bible. Their\r\ntheologian, moralist, and controversialist, Pierre Nicole (1625-95),\r\nauthor of _Essais de Morale_ (1671), if not profound or brilliant,\r\nwas the possessor of learning, good sense, good feeling, and religious\r\nfaith. Under the influence of St. Cyran, the Port-Royalists were in\r\nclose sympathy with the teaching of Jansen, Bishop of Ypres; the\r\nwritings of their great theologian Antoine Arnauld were vigorously\r\nanti-Jesuitical. In 1653 five propositions, professedly extracted\r\nfrom Jansen's _Augustinus_, were condemned by a Papal bull. The\r\ninsulting triumph of the Jesuits drew Arnauld again into controversy;\r\nand on a question concerning divine grace he was condemned in January\r\n1656 by the Sorbonne. \"You who are clever and inquiring\" (_curieux_),\r\nsaid Arnauld to Pascal, \"you ought to do something.\" Next day was\r\nwritten the first of Pascal's _Lettres a un Provincial_, and on 23rd\r\nJanuary it was issued to the public; a second followed within a week;\r\nthe success was immense. The writer concealed his identity under the\r\npseudonym \"Louis de Montalte.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Lettres Provinciales_ are eighteen in number. The first three\r\nand the last three deal with the affair of Arnauld and the Sorbonne,\r\nand the questions under discussion as to the nature and the need of\r\ndivine grace. In the opening letters the clearest intellectual\r\ninsight and the deepest seriousness of spirit are united with the\r\nfinest play of irony, and even with the temper of comedy. The supposed\r\nLouis de Montalte, seeking theological lights from a doctor of the\r\nSorbonne, finds only how hopelessly divided in opinion are the\r\nopponents of Arnauld, and how grotesquely they darken counsel with\r\nspeech. In the twelve letters intervening between the third and the\r\nsixteenth, Pascal takes the offensive, and deploys an incomparably\r\nskilful attack on the moral theology of the Jesuits. For the rigid\r\nthey may have a stricter morality, but for the lax their casuistry\r\nsupplies a pliable code of morals, which, by the aid of ingenious\r\ndistinctions, can find excuses for the worst of crimes. With force\r\nof logic, with fineness of irony, with energy of moral indignation,\r\nwith a literary style combining strength and lightness, Pascal\r\npresses his irresistible assault. The effect of the \"Provincial\r\nLetters\" was to carry the discussion of morals and theology before\r\na new court of appeal--not the Sorbonne, but the public intelligence\r\nand the unsophisticated conscience of men. To French prose they added\r\na masterpiece and a model.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the _Provinciales_ is in part a thing of the past;\r\nthe _Pensees_ deal with problems which can never lose their interest.\r\nAmong Pascal's papers were found, after his early death, many\r\nfragments which his sister, Madame Perier, and his friends recognised\r\nas of rare value; but the editors of the little volume which appeared\r\nin 1670, imagining that they could safeguard its orthodoxy, and even\r\namend its style, freely omitted and altered what Pascal had written.\r\nIt was not until 1844 that a complete and genuine text was established\r\nin the edition of M. Faugere. We can hardly hope to arrange the\r\nfragments so as to exhibit the design of that apology for Christianity,\r\nwith which many of them were doubtless connected, but the main\r\noutlines of Pascal's body of thought can be clearly discerned.\r\n\r\nThe intellect of Pascal, so powerful in its grasp of scientific truth,\r\ncould find by its own researches no certitude in the sphere of\r\nphilosophy and religion. He had been deeply influenced by the\r\nsceptical mind of Montaigne. He found within him a passionate craving\r\nfor certitude; man is so constituted that he can never be at rest\r\nuntil he rests in knowledge of the truth; but man, as he now exists,\r\nis incapable of ascertaining truth; he is weak and miserable, and\r\nyet the very consciousness of his misery is evidence of his greatness;\r\n\"Nature confounds the Pyrrhonist, and reason the dogmatist;\" \"Man\r\nis but a reed, the feeblest of created things, but a reed which\r\nthinks.\" How is this riddle of human nature to be explained? Only\r\nin one way--by a recognition of the truth taught by religion, that\r\nhuman nature is fallen from its true estate, that man is a dethroned\r\nking. And how is the dissonance in man's nature to be overcome? Only\r\nin one way--through union with God made man; with Jesus Christ, the\r\ncentre in which alone we find our weakness and the divine strength.\r\nThrough Christ man is abased and lifted up--abased without despair,\r\nand lifted up without pride; in Him all contradictions are reconciled.\r\nSuch, in brief, is the vital thought from which Pascal's apologetic\r\nproceeds. It does not ignore any of the external evidences of\r\nChristianity; but the irresistible evidence is that derived from the\r\nproblem of human nature and the essential needs of the spirit--a\r\nproblem which religion alone can solve, and needs which Christ alone\r\ncan satisfy. Pascal's \"Thoughts\" are those of an eminent intelligence.\r\nBut they are more than thoughts; they are passionate lyrical cries\r\nof a heart which had suffered, and which had found more than\r\nconsolation; they are the interpretation of the words of his\r\namulet--\"Joie, joie, joie, pleurs de joie.\" The union of the ardour\r\nof a poet or a saint with the scientific rigour of a great geometer,\r\nof wit and brilliance with a sublime pathos, is among the rarest\r\nphenomena in literature; all this and more is found in Pascal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\nTHE DRAMA (MONTCHRESTIEN TO CORNEILLE)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe classical and Italian drama of the sixteenth century was literary,\r\noratorical, lyrical; it was anything but dramatic. Its last\r\nrepresentative, ANTOINE DE MONTCHRESTIEN (1575-1621), a true poet,\r\nand one whose life was a series of strange adventures, wrote, like\r\nhis predecessors, rather for the readers of poetry than for the\r\ntheatre. With a gift for style, and a lyrical talent, seen not only\r\nin the chants of the chorus, but in the general character of his dramas,\r\nhe had little feeling for life and movement; his personages expound\r\ntheir feelings in admirable verse; they do not act. He attempted a\r\ntragedy--L'Ecossaise--on the story of Mary, Queen of Scots, a theme\r\nbeyond his powers. In essentials he belonged rather to the past, whose\r\ntraditions he inherited, than to the future of the stage. But his\r\nfeeling for grandeur of character, for noble attitudes, for the\r\npathetic founded on admiration, and together with these the firm\r\nstructure of his verse, seem to warrant one in thinking of him as\r\nin some respects a forerunner of Corneille.\r\n\r\nAt the Hotel de Bourgogne, until 1599, the Confreres de la Passion\r\nstill exhibited the mediaeval drama. It passed away when their theatre\r\nwas occupied by the company of Valleran Lecomte, who had in his pay\r\na dramatist of inexhaustible fertility--ALEXANDRE HARDY (_c_. 1560\r\nto _c_. 1630). During thirty years, from the opening of the\r\nseventeenth century onwards, Hardy, author of some six or seven\r\nhundred pieces, of which forty-one remain, reigned as master of the\r\nstage.[1] A skilful improvisor, devoid of genius, devoid of taste,\r\nhe is the founder of the French theatre; he first made a true appeal\r\nto the people; he first showed a true feeling for theatrical effects.\r\nWherever material suitable for his purposes could be caught\r\nat--ancient or modern, French, Italian, or Spanish--Hardy made it\r\nhis own. Whatever form seemed likely to win the popular favour, this\r\nhe accepted or divined. The _Astree_ had made pastoral the fashion;\r\nHardy was ready with his pastoral dramas. The Italian and Spanish\r\nnovels were little tragi-comedies waiting to be dramatised;\r\nforthwith Hardy cast them into a theatrical mould. Writing for the\r\npeople, he was not trammelled by the unities of time and place; the\r\nmediaeval stage arrangements favoured romantic freedom. In his\r\ndesire to please a public which demanded animation, action, variety,\r\nHardy allowed romantic incident to predominate over character; hence,\r\nthough he produced tragedies founded on legendary or historical\r\nsubjects, his special talent is seen rather in tragi-comedy. He\r\ncomplicated the intrigue, he varied the scenes, he shortened the\r\nmonologues, he suppressed or reduced the chorus--in a word, the drama\r\nin his hands ceased to be oratorical or lyrical, and became at length\r\ndramatic. The advance was great; and it was achieved by a hack\r\nplaywright scrambling for his crusts of bread.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Or thirty-four pieces, if _Theagene et Cariclee_ be\r\nreckoned as only one.]\r\n\r\nBut to dramatic life and movement it was necessary that order,\r\ndiscipline, regulation should be added. The rules of the unities were\r\nnot observed by Hardy--were perhaps unknown to him. But they were\r\nknown to others. Jean de Schelandre (the pseudonym formed from the\r\nletters of his name being Daniel d'Ancheres), in his vast drama in\r\ntwo parts, _Tyr et Sidon_, claimed all the freedom of the mysteries\r\nin varying the scene, in mingling heroic matter with buffoonery. In\r\nthe edition of 1628 a preface appears by Francois Ogier, a learned\r\nchurchman, maintaining that the modern stage, in accordance with\r\naltered circumstances, should maintain its rights to complete\r\nimaginative liberty against the authority of the Greeks, who\r\npresented their works before different spectators under different\r\nconditions. Ogier's protest was without effect. Almost immediately\r\nafter its appearance the _Sophonisbe_ of Jean de Mairet was given,\r\nand the classical tragedy of France was inaugurated on a popular stage.\r\nIn the preface to his pastoral tragi-comedy _Sylvanire_, Mairet in\r\n1631 formulated the doctrine of the unities. The adhesion of Richelieu\r\nand the advocacy of Chapelain insured their triumph. The \"rules\" came\r\nto be regarded as the laws of a literary species.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the Spanish drama, seen in the writings of Rotrou\r\nand others, might be supposed to make for freedom. It encouraged\r\nromantic inventions and ambitious extravagances of style. Much that\r\nis rude and unformed is united with a curiosity for points and laboured\r\ningenuity in the dramatic work of Scudery, Du Ryer, Tristan l'Hermite.\r\nA greater dramatist than these showed how Spanish romance could\r\ncoalesce with French tragedy in a drama which marks an epoch--the\r\n_Cid_; and the _Cid_, calling forth the judgment of the Academy,\r\nserved to establish the supremacy of the so-called rules of Aristotle.\r\n\r\nPIERRE CORNEILLE, son of a legal official, was born at Rouen in 1606.\r\nHis high promise as a pupil of the Jesuits was not confirmed when\r\nhe attempted to practise at the bar; he was retiring, and spoke with\r\ndifficulty. At twenty-three his first dramatic piece, _Melite_, a\r\ncomedy, suggested, it is told, by an adventure of his youth, was given\r\nwith applause in Paris; it glitters with points, and is of a\r\ncomplicated intrigue, but to contemporaries the plot appeared less\r\nentangled and the style more natural than they seem to modern readers.\r\nThe tragi-comedy, _Clitandre_, which followed (1632), was a romantic\r\ndrama, crowded with extravagant incidents, after the manner of Hardy.\r\nIn _La Veuve_ he returned to the style of _Melite_, but with less\r\nartificial brilliance and more real vivacity; it was published with\r\nlaudatory verses prefixed, in one of which Scudery bids the stars\r\nretire for the sun has risen. The scene is laid in Paris, and some\r\npresentation of contemporary manners is made in _La Galerie du Palais_\r\nand _La Place Royale_. It was something to replace the nurse of elder\r\ncomedy by the soubrette. The attention of Richelieu was attracted\r\nto the new dramatic author; he was numbered among the five _garcons\r\npoetes_ who worked upon the dramatic plans of the Cardinal; but he\r\ndispleased his patron by his imaginative independence. Providing\r\nhimself with a convenient excuse, Corneille retired to Rouen.\r\n\r\nThese early works were ventures among which the poet was groping for\r\nhis true way. He can hardly be said to have found it in _Medee_ (1635),\r\nbut it was an advance to have attempted tragedy; the grandiose style\r\nof Seneca was a challenge to his genius; and in the famous line--\r\n\r\n   \"_Dans un si grand revers, que vous reste-t-il? Moi!_\"\r\n\r\nwe see the flash of his indomitable pride of will, we hear the sudden\r\nthunder of his verse. An acquaintance, M. de Chalon, who had been\r\none of the household of Marie de Medicis, directed Corneille to the\r\nSpanish drama. The _Illusion Comique_, the latest of his tentative\r\nplays, is a step towards the _Cid_; its plot is fantastical, but in\r\nsome of the fanfaronades of the braggart Matamore, imported from Spain,\r\nare pseudo-heroics which only needed a certain transposition to\r\nbecome the language of chivalric heroism. The piece closes with a\r\nlofty eulogy of the French stage.\r\n\r\nThe sun had indeed risen and the stars might disappear when in the\r\nclosing days of 1636 the _Cid_ was given in Paris at the Theatre du\r\nMarais; the eulogy of the stage was speedily justified by its author.\r\nHis subject was found by Corneille in a Spanish drama, _Las Mocedades\r\ndel Cid_, by Guilhem de Castro; the treatment was his own; he reduced\r\nthe action from that of a chronicle-history to that of a tragedy;\r\nhe centralised it around the leading personages; he transferred it\r\nin its essential causes from the external world of accident to the\r\ninner world of character; the critical events are moral events,\r\nvictories of the soul, triumphs not of fortune but of the will. And\r\nthus, though there are epic episodes and lyric outbreaks in the play,\r\nthe _Cid_ definitely fixed, for the first time in France, the type\r\nof tragedy. The central tragic strife here is not one of rival houses.\r\nRodrigue, to avenge his father's wrong, has slain the father of his\r\nbeloved Chimene; Chimene demands from the King the head of her beloved\r\nRodrigue. In the end Rodrigue's valour atones for his offence. The\r\nstruggle is one of passion with honour or duty; the fortunes of the\r\nhero and heroine are affected by circumstance, but their fate lies\r\nin their own high hearts.\r\n\r\nThe triumph of Corneille's play was immense. The Cardinal, however,\r\ndid not join in it. Richelieu's intractable poet had glorified Spain\r\nat an inconvenient moment; he had offered an apology for the code\r\nof honour when edicts had been issued to check the rage of the duel;\r\nyet worse, he had not been crushed by the great man's censure. The\r\nquarrel of the _Cid_, in which Mairet and Scudery took an embittered\r\npart, was encouraged by Richelieu. He pressed the Academy, of which\r\nCorneille was not a member until 1647, for a judgment upon the piece,\r\nand at length he was partially satisfied by a pronouncement, drawn\r\nup by Chapelain, which condemned its ethics and its violation of\r\ndramatic proprieties, yet could not deny the author's genius.\r\nCorneille was deeply discouraged, but prepared himself for future\r\nvictories.\r\n\r\nUntil 1640 he remained silent. In that illustrious year _Horace_ and\r\n_Cinna_ were presented in rapid succession. From Spain, the land of\r\nchivalric honour, the dramatist passed to antique Rome, the mother\r\nand the nurse of heroic virtue. In the _Cid_ the dramatic conflict\r\nis between love and filial duty; in _Horace_ it is between love, on\r\nthe one side, united with the domestic affections, and, on the other,\r\ndevotion to country. In both plays the inviolable will is arbiter\r\nof the contention. The story of the Horatii and Curiatii, as told\r\nby Livy, is complicated by the union of the families through love\r\nand marriage; but patriotism requires the sacrifice of the tenderer\r\npassions. It must be admitted that the interest declines after the\r\nthird act, and that our sympathies are alienated from the younger\r\nHorace by the murder of a sister; we are required to feel that a private\r\ncrime, the offence of overstrained patriotism, is obliterated in the\r\nglory of the country. In _Cinna_ we pass from regal to imperial Rome;\r\nthe commonwealth is represented by Augustus; a great monarchy is\r\nglorified, but in the noblest way, for the highest act of empire is\r\nto wield supreme power under the sway of magnanimity, and to remain\r\nthe master of all self-regarding passions. The conspiracy of Cinna\r\nis discovered; it is a prince's part to pardon, and Augustus rises\r\nto a higher empire than that of Rome by the conquest of himself. In\r\nboth _Horace_ and _Cinna_ there are at times a certain overstrain,\r\nan excess of emphasis, a resolve to pursue heroism to all extremities;\r\nbut the conception of moral grandeur is genuine and lofty; the error\r\nof Corneille was the error of an imagination enamoured of the sublime.\r\n\r\nBut are there not heroisms of religion as pure as those of patriotism?\r\nAnd must we go back to pagan days to find the highest virtue? Or can\r\ndivine grace effect no miracles above those of the natural will?\r\nCorneille gives his answer to such a challenge in the tragedy of\r\n_Polyeucte_ (1643). It is the story of Christian martyrdom; a homage\r\nrendered to absolute self-devotion to the ideal; a canticle intoned\r\nin celebration of heavenly grace. Polyeucte, the martyr, sacrifices\r\nto his faith not only life, but love; his wife, who, while she knew\r\nhim imperfectly, gave him an imperfect love, is won both for God and\r\nfor her husband by his heroism; she is caught away from her tenderness\r\nfor Severe into the flame of Polyeucte's devout rapture; and through\r\nher Severe himself is elevated to an unexpected magnanimity. The\r\nfamily, the country, the monarchy, religion--these in turn were\r\nhonoured by the genius of Corneille. He had lifted the drama from\r\na form of loose diversion to be a great art; he had recreated it as\r\nthat noblest pastime whose function is to exercise and invigorate\r\nthe soul.\r\n\r\nThe transition from _Polyeucte_ to _Le Menteur_, of the same year,\r\nis among the most surprising in literature.[2] From the most elevated\r\nof tragedies we pass to a comedy, which, while not belonging to the\r\ngreat comedy of character, is charmingly gay. We expect no grave\r\nmoralities here, nor do we find them. The play is a free and original\r\nadaptation from a work of the Spanish dramatist Alarcon, but in\r\nCorneille's hands it becomes characteristically French. Young\r\nDorante, the liar, invents his fictions through an irresistible\r\ngenius for romancing. His indignant father may justly ask, Has he\r\na heart? Is he a gentleman? But how can a youth with such a pretty\r\nwit resist the fascination of his own lies? He is sufficiently\r\npunished by the fact that they do not assist, but rather trouble,\r\nthe course of his love adventure, and we demand no further poetical\r\njustice. In Corneille's art, tragedy had defined itself, and comedy\r\nwas free to be purely comic; but it is also literary--light, yet solid\r\nin structure; easy, yet exact in style. The _Suite du Menteur_,\r\nfounded on a comedy by Lope de Vega, has a curious attraction of its\r\nown, half-fantastic as it is, and half-realistic; yet it has shared\r\nthe fate of all continuations, and could not attain the popularity\r\nof its predecessor. It lacks gaiety; the liar has sunk into a rascal,\r\nand we can hardly lend credence to the amendment in his mendacious\r\nhabit when he applies the art of dissimulation to generous purposes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Polyeucte_ may possibly be as early as 1641.]\r\n\r\nThese are the masterpieces of Corneille. Already in _Pompee_,\r\nalthough its date is that of _Polyeucte_, while the great dramatist\r\nis present throughout, he is not always present at his best. It should\r\nnot surprise us that Corneille preferred Lucan to Virgil. Something\r\nof the over-emphasis of the _Pharsalia_, his original, has entered\r\ninto the play; but the pomp of the verse is no vulgar pomp. A graver\r\nfault is the want of a dramatic centre for the action, which tends\r\ntoo much towards the epic. Pompey is the presiding power of the\r\ntragedy; his spirit dominates the lesser characters; but he does not\r\nappear in person. The political interest develops somewhat to the\r\nsubordination of the personal interest. Corneille's unhappy theory\r\nof later years, that love is unworthy of a place in high tragedy,\r\nsave as an episode, is here exemplified in the passion of Caesar for\r\nCleopatra; but, in truth, love is too sovereign a power to admit of\r\nits being tagged to tragedy as an ornament.\r\n\r\nUntil 1636 Corneille was seeking his way. From 1636 to 1644 his genius\r\nsoared on steady pinions. During the eight years that followed he\r\ntriumphed, but he also faltered. _Rodogune_ (1644), which he\r\npreferred to all his other plays, is certainly, by virtue of the\r\nenormity of the characters, the violence of the passions, the vastness\r\nof its crimes, the most romantic of his tragedies; it is constructed\r\nwith the most skilful industry; from scene to scene the emotion is\r\nintensified and heightened until the great fifth act is reached; but\r\nif by incomparable audacity the dramatist attains the ideal, it is\r\nan ideal of horror. _Theodore_, a second play of martyrdom, fell far\r\nbelow _Polyeucte_. _Heraclius_ is obscure through the complication\r\nof its intrigue. _Don Sanche d'Aragon_, a romantic tragi-comedy, is\r\nless admirable as a whole than in the more brilliant scenes. In the\r\nhistorical drama _Nicomede_ (1651), side by side with tragic\r\nsolemnities appears matter of a familiar kind. It was the last great\r\neffort of its author's genius. The failure of _Pertharite_, in 1652,\r\nled to the withdrawal of Corneille from the theatre during seven years.\r\nHe completed during his seclusion a rendering into verse of the\r\n_Imitation of Jesus Christ_. When he returned to the stage it was\r\nwith enfeebled powers, which were overstrained by the effort of his\r\nwill; yet he could still write noble lines, and in the tragedy-ballet\r\nof _Psyche_, in which Quinault and Moliere were his collaborators,\r\nthe most charming verses are those of Corneille. His young rival\r\nRacine spoke to the hearts of a generation less heroic and swayed\r\nby tenderer passion, and the old man resented the change. Domestic\r\nsorrows were added to the grief of ill success in his art. Living\r\nsimply, his means were narrow for his needs. The last ten years of\r\nhis life were years of silence. He died in 1684, at the age of\r\nseventy-eight.\r\n\r\nThe drama of Corneille deals with what is extraordinary, but in what\r\nis extraordinary it seeks for truth. He finds the marvellous in the\r\ntriumphs of the human will. His great inventive powers were applied\r\nto creating situations for the manifestation of heroic energy.\r\nHistory attracted him, because a basis of fact seemed to justify what\r\notherwise could not be accepted as probable. Great personages suited\r\nhis purpose, because they can deploy their powers on the amplest scale.\r\nHis characters, men and women, act not through blind, instinctive\r\npassion, but with deliberate and intelligent force; they reason, and\r\ntoo often with casuistical subtlety, about their emotions. At length\r\nhe came to glorify the will apart from its aims and ends, when tending\r\neven to crime, or acting, as it were, in the void. He thought much\r\nof the principles of his art, and embodied his conclusions in critical\r\ndissertations and studies of his own works. He accepted the rule of\r\nthe unities of place and time (of which at first he was ignorant)\r\nas far as his themes permitted, as far as the rules served to\r\nconcentrate action and secure verisimilitude. His mastery in verse\r\nof a masculine eloquence is unsurpassed; his dialogue of rapid\r\nstatement and swift reply is like a combat with Roman short swords;\r\nin memorable single lines he explodes, as it were, a vast charge of\r\nlatent energy, and effects a clearance for the progress of his action.\r\nHis faults, like his virtues, are great; and though faults and virtues\r\nmay be travestied, both are in reality alike inimitable.\r\n\r\nAlone among Corneille's dramatic rivals, if they deserve that\r\nname--Du Ryer, Tristan, Scudery, Boisrobert, and others--JEAN ROTROU\r\n(1610-50) had the magnanimity to render homage to the master of his\r\nart. While still a boy he read Sophocles, and resolved that he would\r\nlive for the dramatic art. His facility was great, and he had the\r\nfaults of a facile writer, who started on his career at the age of\r\nnineteen. He could not easily submit to the regulation of the\r\nclassical drama, and squandered his talents in extravagant\r\ntragi-comedies; but his work grew sounder and stronger towards the\r\nclose. _Saint Genest_ (1645), which is derived, but in no servile\r\nfashion, from Lope de Vega, recalls _Polyeucte_; an actor of the time\r\nof Diocletian, in performing the part of a Christian martyr, is\r\npenetrated by the heroic passion which he represents, confesses his\r\nfaith, and receives its crown in martyrdom. The tragi-comedy _Don\r\nBernard de Cabrere_ and the tragedy _Venceslas_ of the following year\r\nexhibit the romantic and passionate sides of Rotrou's genius. The\r\nintemperate yet noble Ladislas has rashly and in error slain his\r\nbrother; he is condemned to death by his father Venceslas, King of\r\nPoland, and he accepts his doom. The situation is such as Corneille\r\nmight have imagined; but Rotrou's young hero in the end is pardoned\r\nand receives the kingdom. If their careless construction and unequal\r\nstyle in general forbade the dramas of Rotrou to hold the stage, they\r\nremained as a store from which greater artists than he could draw\r\ntheir material. His death was noble: the plague having broken out\r\nat Dreux, he hastened from Paris to the stricken town, disregarding\r\nall affectionate warnings, there to perform his duty as a magistrate;\r\nwithin a few days the inhabitants followed Rotrou's coffin to the\r\nparish church.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS CORNEILLE, the faithful and tender brother of \"le grand\r\nCorneille,\" and his successor in the Academy, belongs to a younger\r\ngeneration. He was born in 1625, and did not die until near the close\r\nof the first decade of the eighteenth century. As an industrious\r\nplaywright he imitated his brother's manner, and reproduced his\r\nsituations with a feebler hand. Many of his dramas are of Spanish\r\norigin, comic imbroglios, tragic extravagances; they rather diverted\r\ndramatic art from its true way than aided its advance. Perhaps for\r\nthis reason they were the more popular. His _Timocrate_ (1656), drawn\r\nfrom the romance of _Cleopatre_, and itself a romance written for\r\nthe stage, had a success rarely equalled during the century. The hero\r\nis at once the enemy and the lover of the Queen of Argos; under one\r\nname he besieges her, under another he repels his own attack; he is\r\nhated and adored, the conquered and the conqueror. The languors of\r\nconventional love and the plaintive accents of conventional grief\r\nsuited the powers of the younger Corneille. His _Ariane_ (1672)\r\npresents a heroine, Ariadne, abandoned by Theseus, who reminds us\r\nof one of Racine's women, drawn with less certain lines and fainter\r\ncolours. In _Le Comte d'Essex_ history is transformed to a romance.\r\nPerhaps the greatest glory of Thomas Corneille is that his reception\r\nas an Academician became the occasion for a just and eloquent tribute\r\nto the genius of his brother uttered by Racine, when the bitterness\r\nof rivalry was forgotten and the offences of Racine's earlier years\r\nwere nobly repaired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\nSOCIETY AND PUBLIC LIFE IN LETTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore noticing the theories of classical poetry in the writings of\r\nits master critic, Boileau, we must glance at certain writers who\r\nbelonged rather to the world of public life and of society than to\r\nthe world of art, but who became each a master in literary craft,\r\nas it were, by an irresistible instinct. Memoirs, maxims, epistolary\r\ncorrespondence, the novel, in their hands took a distinguished place\r\nin the hierarchy of literary art.\r\n\r\nFRANCOIS VI., DUC DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULD, Prince de Marsillac, was born\r\nin 1613, of one of the greatest families of France. His life is divided\r\ninto two periods--one of passionate activity, when with romantic\r\nardour he threw himself into the struggles of the Fronde, only to\r\nbe foiled and disillusioned; and the other of bitter reflection,\r\nconsoled by certain social successes, loyal friendships, and an\r\nunique literary distinction. His _Maximes_ are the brief confession\r\nof his experience of life, an utterance of the pessimism of an\r\naristocratic spirit, moulded into a form proper to the little world\r\nof the _salon_--each maxim a drop of the attar not of roses but of\r\nsome more poignant and bitterly aromatic blossom. In the circle of\r\nMme. de Sable, now an elderly _precieuse_, a circle half-Epicurean,\r\nhalf-Jansenist, frivolously serious and morosely gay, the\r\ncomposition of maxims and \"sentences\" became a fashion. Those of La\r\nRochefoucauld were submitted to her as to an oracle; five years were\r\ngiven to shaping a tiny volume; fifteen years to rehandling and\r\npolishing every phrase. They are like a collection of medals struck\r\nin honour of the conquests of cynicism. The first surreptitious\r\nedition, printed in Holland in 1664, was followed by an authorised\r\nedition in 1665; the number of maxims, at first 317, rose finally\r\nin 1678 to 504; some were omitted; many were reduced to the extreme\r\nof concision; under the influence of Mme. de la Fayette, in the later\r\ntexts the indictment of humanity was slightly attenuated. \"Il m'a\r\ndonne de l'esprit,\" said Mme. de la Fayette, \"mais j'ai reforme son\r\ncoeur.\"\r\n\r\nThe motto of the book, \"Our virtues are commonly vices in disguise,\"\r\nexpresses its central idea. La Rochefoucauld does not absolutely deny\r\ndisinterested goodness; there may be some such instinctive virtue\r\nlying below all passions which submit to be analysed; he does not\r\nconsider the love of God, the parental or the filial affections; but\r\nwherever he applies analysis, it is to reduce each apparently\r\ndisinterested feeling to self-love. \"We all have strength enough to\r\nendure the misfortunes of another;\" \"When vices desert us, we flatter\r\nourselves with the belief that it is we who desert them;\" \"With true\r\nlove it is as with apparitions--every one talks of them, but few\r\npersons have seen them;\" \"Virtues lose themselves in self-interest\r\nas rivers lose themselves in the sea;\" \"In the adversity of our best\r\nfriends we always find something which does not displease us\"--such\r\nare the moral comments on life graven in ineffaceable lines by La\r\nRochefoucauld. He is not a philosophic thinker, but he is a\r\npenetrating and remorseless critic, who remains at one fixed point\r\nof view; self-interest is assuredly a large factor in human conduct,\r\nand he exposes much that is real in the heart of man; much also that\r\nis not universally true was true of the world in which he had moved;\r\nwhether we accept or reject his doctrine, we are instructed by a\r\nstatement so implacable and so precise of the case against human\r\nnature as he saw it. Pitiless he was not himself; perhaps his artistic\r\ninstinct led him to exclude concessions which would have marred the\r\nunity of his conception; possibly his vanity co-operated in producing\r\nphrases which live and circulate by virtue of the shock they\r\ncommunicate to our self-esteem. The merit of his _Maximes_ as examples\r\nof style--a style which may be described as lapidary--is\r\nincomparable; it is impossible to say more, or to say it more\r\nadequately, in little; but one wearies in the end of the monotony\r\nof an idea unalterably applied, of unqualified brilliance, of\r\nunrelieved concision; we anticipate our surprise, and its purpose\r\nis defeated. Traces of preciosity are found in some of the earliest\r\nsentences; that infirmity was soon overcome by La Rochefoucauld, and\r\nhis utterances become as clear and as hard as diamond.\r\n\r\nHe died at the age of sixty-seven, in the arms of Bossuet. His\r\n_Memoires_,[1] relating to the period of the Fronde, are written with\r\nan air of studied historical coldness, which presents a striking\r\ncontrast to the brilliant vivacity of Retz.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Ed. 1662, surreptitious and incomplete; complete ed.,\r\n1868-1884.]\r\n\r\nThe most interesting figure of the Fronde, its portrait-painter, its\r\nanalyst, its historian, is CARDINAL DE RETZ (1614-1679). Italian by\r\nhis family, and Italian in some features of his character, he had,\r\non a scale of grandeur, the very genius of conspiracy. When his first\r\nwork, _La Conjuration de Fiesque_, was read by Richelieu, the judgment\r\nwhich that great statesman pronounced was penetrating--\"Voila un\r\ndangereux esprit.\" Low of stature, ugly, ill-made, short-sighted,\r\nRetz played the part of a gallant and a duellist. Never had any one\r\nless vocation for the spiritual duties of an ecclesiastic; but, being\r\na churchman, he would be an illustrious actor on the ecclesiastical\r\nstage. There was something demoniac in his audacity, and with the\r\nspirit of turbulence and intrigue was united a certain power of\r\nself-restraint. When fallen, he still tried to be magnificent, though\r\nin disgrace: he would resign his archbishopric, pay his enormous debts,\r\nresign his cardinalate, exhibit himself as the hero in misfortune.\r\n\"Having lived as a Catiline,\" said Voltaire, \"he lived as an Atticus.\"\r\nIn retirement, as his adventurous life drew towards its close, he\r\nwrote, at the request of Madame de Caumartin, those Memoirs which\r\nremained unpublished until 1717, and which have insured him a place\r\nin literature only second to Saint-Simon.\r\n\r\nIt was an age remarkable for its memoirs; those of Mlle. de Montpensier,\r\nof Mme. de Motteville, of Bussy-Rabutin are only a few of many. The\r\n_Memoires_ of Retz far surpass the rest not only in their historical\r\ninterest, but in their literary excellence. Arranging facts and dates\r\nso that he might superbly figure in the drama designed for future\r\ngenerations, he falsifies the literal truth of things; but he lays\r\nbare the inner truth of politics, of life, of character, with\r\nincomparable mastery. He exposes the disorder of his conduct in early\r\nyears with little scruple. The origins of the Fronde are expounded\r\nin pages of profound sagacity. His narrative has all the impetuosity,\r\nall the warmth and hues of life, all the tumult and rumour of action;\r\nhe paints, but in painting he explains; he touches the hidden springs\r\nof passion; his portraits of contemporaries are not more vivid in\r\ntheir colours than they are searching in their psychology: and in\r\nhis style there is that negligent grandeur which belongs rather to\r\nthe days of Louis XIII. than to the age of his successor, when language\r\ngrew more exact for the intelligence, but lost much of its passion\r\nand untamed energy.\r\n\r\nThe epistolary art, in which the art itself is nature, may be said\r\nto have reached perfection, with scarcely an historical development,\r\nin the letters of MME. DE SEVIGNE. The letters of Balzac are rhetorical\r\nexercises; those of Voiture are often, to use a word of Shakespeare,\r\n\"heavy lightness, serious vanity.\" Mme. de Sevigne entered into the\r\ngains of a cultivated society, in which graceful converse had become\r\na necessity of existence. She wrote delightfully, because she\r\nconveyed herself into her letters, and because she conversed freely\r\nand naturally by means of her pen. Marie de Rabutin-Chantal, born\r\nin 1626, deprived of both parents in her earliest years, was carefully\r\ntrained in literary studies--Latin, Italian, French--under the\r\nsuperintendence of her uncle, \"le bien bon,\" the Abbe de Coulanges.\r\nAmong her teachers were the scholar Menage and the poet Chapelain.\r\nMarried at eighteen to an unworthy husband, the Marquis Henri de\r\nSevigne, she was left at twenty-five a widow with two children, the\r\ndaughter whom she loved with excess of devotion, and a son, who\r\nreceived from his mother a calmer affection. She saw the life of the\r\ncourt, she was acquainted with eminent writers, she frequented the\r\nHotel de Rambouillet (retaining from it a touch of preciosity, \"one\r\nsuperfluous ribbon,\" says Nisard, \"in a simple and elegant toilet\"),\r\nshe knew and loved the country and its rural joys, she read with\r\nexcellent judgment and eager delight the great books of past and\r\npresent times.\r\n\r\nWhen her daughter, \"the prettiest girl in France,\" was married in\r\n1669 to M. de Grignan, soon to be Lieutenant-General of Provence,\r\nMme. de Sevigne, desiring to be constantly one with her, at least\r\nin thought, transferred into letters her whole life from day to day,\r\ntogether with much of the social life of the time during a period\r\nof nearly thirty years. She allowed her pen to trot, throwing the\r\nreins, as she says, upon its neck; but if her letters are\r\nimprovisations, they are improvisations regulated by an exquisite\r\nartistic instinct. Her imagination is alert in discovering,\r\ncombining, and presenting the happiest meanings of reality. She is\r\ngay, witty, ironical, malicious, and all this without a trace of\r\nmalignity; amiable rather than passionate, except in the ardour of\r\nher maternal devotion, which sometimes proved oppressive to a\r\ndaughter who, though not unloving, loved with a temperate heart;\r\nfaithful to friends, loyal to those who had fallen into misfortune,\r\nbut neither sentimental nor romantic, nor disposed to the\r\ngenerosities of a universal humanity; a woman of spirit, energy, and\r\ngood sense; capable of serious reflection, though not of profound\r\nthought; endowed with an exquisite sense of the power of words, and,\r\nindeed, the creator of a literary style. While her interests were\r\nin the main of a mundane kind, she was in sympathy with Port-Royal,\r\nadmired the writings of Pascal, and deeply reverenced Nicole.\r\nDomestic affairs, business (concern for her children having involved\r\nher in financial troubles), the aristocratic life of Paris and\r\nVersailles, literature, the pleasures and tedium of the country, the\r\ndulness or gaiety of a health-resort, the rise and fall of those in\r\npower, the petty intrigues and spites and follies of the day--these,\r\nand much besides, enter into Mme. de Sevigne's records, records made\r\nupon the moment, with all the animation of an immediate impression,\r\nbut remaining with us as one of the chief documents for the social\r\nhistory of the second half of the seventeenth century. In April 1696\r\nMme. de Sevigne died.\r\n\r\nBeside the letters addressed to her daughter are others--far fewer\r\nin number--to her cousin Bussy-Rabutin, to her cousin Mme. de\r\nCoulanges, to Pomponne, and other correspondents. In Bussy's\r\n_Memoires et Correspondance_ (1696-97) first appeared certain of her\r\nletters; a collection, very defective and inaccurate, was published\r\nin 1726; eight years later the first portion of an authorised text\r\nwas issued under the sanction of the writer's grand-daughter;\r\ngradually the material was recovered, until it became of vast extent;\r\neven since the appearance of the edition among the _Grands Ecrivains\r\nde la France_ two volumes of _Lettres inedites_ have been published.\r\n\r\nAmong the other letter-writers of the period, perhaps the most\r\ndistinguished were Mme. de Sevigne's old and attached friend Mme.\r\nde la Fayette, and the woman of supreme authority with the King, Mme.\r\nde Maintenon. A just view of Mme. de Maintenon's character has been\r\nlong obscured by the letters forged under her name by La Beaumelle,\r\nand by the bitter hostility of Saint-Simon. On a basis of ardour and\r\nsensibility she built up a character of unalterable reason and good\r\nsense. Her letters are not creations of genius, unless practical\r\nwisdom and integrity of purpose be forms of genius. She does not gossip\r\ndelightfully; at times she may seem a little hard or dry; but her\r\nreason is really guided by human kindness. \"Her style,\" wrote a high\r\nauthority, Dollinger, \"is clear, terse, refined, often sententious;\r\nher business letters are patterns of simplicity and pregnant brevity.\r\nThey might be characterised as womanly yet manly, so well do they\r\ncombine the warmth and depth of womanly feeling with the strength\r\nand lucidity of a masculine mind.\" The foundation of Saint-Cyr, for\r\nthe education of girls wellborn but poor, was the object of her\r\nconstant solicitude; there she put out her talents as a teacher and\r\nguide of youth to the best interest; there she found play for her\r\nbest affections: \"C'est le lieu,\" she said, \"de delices pour moi.\"\r\n\r\nThe friend of Madame de Sevigne, the truest woman whom La\r\nRochefoucauld had ever known, MADAME DE LA FAYETTE was the author\r\nof two historical works, of which one is exquisite--a memorial of\r\nher friend the Duchess of Orleans, and of two--perhaps\r\nthree--romances, the latest of which, in the order of chronology,\r\nis the masterpiece of seventeenth-century fiction. Marie de la Vergne,\r\nborn in 1634, a pupil of Menage, married at twenty-one to M. de la\r\nFayette, became the trusted companion of the bright and gracious\r\nHenrietta of England. It is not that part of Madame's life, when she\r\nacted as intermediary between Louis XIV. and her brother, Charles\r\nII., that is recorded by her friend: it is the history of her heart.\r\nNothing is more touching in its simplicity than the narrative of\r\nMadame's last moments; it serves as the best possible comment on the\r\npathetic Funeral Oration of Bossuet. We have no grounds for asserting\r\nthat the married life of Madame de la Fayette was unhappy, except\r\nthrough the inadequacy of a husband whose best qualities seem to have\r\nbeen of a negative kind. During the fifteen years which preceded the\r\ndeath of La Rochefoucauld her friendship for him was the centre of\r\nher existence. She seemed to bear about with her some secret grief;\r\nsomething remained veiled from other friends than he, and they named\r\nher _le Brouillard_. She outlived her friend by thirteen years, and\r\nduring ten was widowed. In 1693 she died.\r\n\r\nHer earliest novel, _La Princesse de Montpensier_ (1662), a tale of\r\nthe days of the Valois and of St. Bartholomew, is remarkable for its\r\ntruthful pictures of the manners of the court, its rendering of\r\nnatural and unexaggerated feeling, and for the fact that it treats\r\nof married life, occupying itself with such themes as have been dealt\r\nwith in many of its modern successors. The _Zayde_, of eight years\r\nlater, was written in collaboration with Segrais. It is in _La\r\nPrincesse de Cleves_ (1678) that the genius and the heart of Madame\r\nde la Fayette find a perfect expression. The Princess, married to\r\na husband who loves her devotedly, and whom she honours, but whose\r\nfeelings she cannot return, is tempted by the brilliant Duc de Nemours\r\nand by the weakness of her own passion, to infidelity. She resolves\r\nto confide her struggle to her husband, and seek in him a protector\r\nagainst herself. The hard confession is made, but a grievous and\r\ninevitable change has passed over their lives. Believing himself\r\ndeceived, M. de Cleves is seized by a fever and dies, not without\r\nthe consolation of learning his error. Nemours renews his vows and\r\nentreaties; the Princess refuses his hand, and atones for her error\r\nin cloistered seclusion. The tale has lost none of its beauty and\r\npathos after a lapse of two centuries. Does it reveal the hidden grief\r\nof the writer's life? And was her friend, the Duc de la Rochefoucauld,\r\ndelivered from his gout and more than a score of years, transformed\r\nby Madame de la Fayette into the foiled lover of her tale?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\nBOILEAU AND LA FONTAINE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great name in criticism of the second half of the seventeenth\r\ncentury is that of Boileau. But one of whom Boileau spoke harshly,\r\na soldier, a man of the world, the friend of Ninon de l'Enclos, a\r\nsceptical Epicurean, an amateur in letters, Saint-Evremond\r\n(1613-1703), among his various writings, aided the cause of criticism\r\nby the intuition which he had of what is excellent, by a fineness\r\nof judgment as far removed from mere licence as from the pedantry\r\nof rules. Fallen into disfavour with the King, Saint-Evremond was\r\nreceived into the literary society of London. His criticism is that\r\nof a fastidious taste, of balance and moderation, guided by tradition,\r\nyet open to new views if they approved themselves to his culture and\r\ngood sense. Had his studies been more serious, had his feelings been\r\nmore generous and ardent, had his moral sense been less shallow, he\r\nmight have made important contributions to literature. As it was,\r\nto be a man of the world was his trade, to be a writer was only an\r\nadmirable foible.\r\n\r\nNICOLAS BOILEAU, named DESPREAUX, from a field (pre) of his father's\r\nproperty at Crosne, was born in Paris, 1636, son of the registrar\r\nof the Grand Chambre du Palais. His choice of a profession lay between\r\nthe Church and that with which his father was connected--the law;\r\nbut though he made some study of theology, and was called to the bar,\r\nhis inclination for literature could not be resisted. His whole life,\r\nindeed, was that of a man of letters--upright, honourable, serious,\r\ndignified, simple; generous to the friends whose genius he could\r\njustly applaud; merciless to books and authors condemned by his reason,\r\nhis good sense, his excellent judgment. He was allied by an ardent\r\nadmiration to Racine, and less intimately to Moliere, La Fontaine,\r\nand Chapelle; Jansenist through his religious sympathies, and\r\nclosely attached to the venerable Arnauld; appointed historiographer\r\nto the King (1677) together with Racine; an Academician by the King's\r\ndesire, notwithstanding the opposition of his literary enemies. In\r\nhis elder years his great position of authority in the world of letters\r\nwas assured, but he suffered from infirmities of body, and from an\r\nincreasing severity of temper. In 1711 he died, bequeathing a large\r\nsum of money to the poor.\r\n\r\nBoileau's literary career falls into three periods--the first,\r\nmilitant and destructive, in which he waged successful war against\r\nall that seemed to him false and despicable in art; the second,\r\nreconstructive, in which he declared the doctrine of what may be\r\ntermed literary rationalism, and legislated for the French\r\nParnassus; the third, dating from his appointment as historiographer,\r\na period of comparative repose and, to some extent, of decline, but\r\none in which the principles of his literary faith were maintained\r\nand pressed to new conclusions. His writings include twelve satires\r\n(of which the ninth, \"A son Esprit,\" is the chief masterpiece); twelve\r\nepistles (that to Racine being pre-eminent); the literary-didactic\r\npoem, _L'Art Poetique_; a heroi-comical epic, _Le Lutrin_;\r\nmiscellaneous shorter poems (among which may be noted the admirable\r\nepitaph on Arnauld, and an unhappy ode, _Sur la Prise de Namur_, 1693);\r\nand various critical studies in prose, his Lucianic dialogue _Les\r\nHeros de Roman_, satirising the extravagant novels not yet dismissed\r\nto oblivion, and his somewhat truculent _Reflexions sur Longin_ being\r\nspecially deserving of attention. The satires preceded in date the\r\nepistles; of the former, the first nine belong to the years 1660-67;\r\nthe first nine of the epistles to the years 1669-77; three satires\r\nand three epistles may be described as belated. The year 1674 is\r\nmemorable as that in which were published _L'Art Poetique_ and the\r\nfirst four _chants_ of _Le Lutrin_.\r\n\r\nThe genius of Boileau was in a high degree intellectual, animated\r\nby ideas; but it is an error to suppose that a sensuous element is\r\nabsent from his verse. It is verse of the classical school, firm and\r\nclear, but it addresses the ear with a studied harmony, and what\r\nBoileau saw he could render into exact, definite, and vivid expression.\r\nHis imagination was not in a large sense creative; he was wholly\r\nlacking in tenderness and sensibility; his feeling for external\r\nnature was no more than that of a Parisian bourgeois who enjoys for\r\na day the repose of the fields; but for Paris itself, its various\r\naspects, its life, its types, its manners, he had the eye and the\r\nprecise rendering of a realist in art; his faithful objective touch\r\nis like that of a Dutch painter. As a moralist, he is not searching\r\nor profound; he saw too little of the inner world of the heart, and\r\nknew too imperfectly its agitations. When, however, he deals with\r\nliterature--and a just judgment in letters may almost be called an\r\nelement in morals--all his penetration and power become apparent.\r\n\r\nTo clear the ground for the new school of nature, truth and reason\r\nwas Boileau's first task. It was a task which called for courage and\r\nskill. The public taste was still uncertain. Laboured and lifeless\r\nepics like Chapelain's _La Pucelle_, petty ingenuities in metre like\r\nthose of Cotin, violence and over-emphasis, extravagances of\r\nsentiment, faded preciosities, inane pastoralisms, gross or vulgar\r\nburlesques, tragedies languorous and insipid, lyrics of pretended\r\npassion, affectations from the degenerate Italian literature,\r\nsuper-subtleties from Spain--these had still their votaries. And the\r\nconduct of life and characters of men of letters were often unworthy\r\nof the vocation they professed. \"La haine d'un sot livre\" was an\r\ninspiration for Boileau, as it afterwards was for our English satirist\r\nPope; and he felt deeply that dignity of art is connected with dignity\r\nof character and rectitude of life--\"Le vers se sent toujours des\r\nbassesses de coeur.\" He struck at the follies and affectations of\r\nthe world of letters, and he struck with force: it was a needful duty,\r\nand one most effectively performed. Certain of the Epistles, which\r\nare written with less pitiless severity and with a more accomplished\r\nmastery of verse, continue the work of the Satires. From Horace he\r\nderived much, something from Juvenal, and something from his\r\npredecessor Regnier; but he had not the lightness nor the _bonhomie_\r\nof Horace, nor his easy and amiable wisdom.\r\n\r\nIn the _Art Poetique_ Boileau is constructive; he exhibits the true\r\ndoctrine of literature, as he conceived it. Granted genius, fire,\r\nimagination--the gifts of heaven--what should be the self-imposed\r\ndiscipline of a poet? Above all, the cultivation of that power which\r\ndistinguishes false from true, and aids every other faculty--the\r\nreason. \"Nothing,\" declares Boileau, \"is beautiful save what is\r\ntrue;\" nature is the model, the aim and end of art; reason and good\r\nsense discern reality; they test the fidelity of the artistic\r\nimitation of nature; they alone can vouch for the correspondence of\r\nthe idea with its object, and the adequacy of the expression to the\r\nidea. What is permanent and universal in literature lives by the aid\r\nof no fashion of the day, but by virtue of its truth to nature. And\r\nhence is derived the authority of the ancient classics, which have\r\nbeen tried by time and have endured; these we do not accept as tyrants,\r\nbut we may safely follow as guides.\r\n\r\nTo study nature is, however, before all else to study man--that is,\r\nhuman nature--and to distinguish in human nature what is universal\r\nand abiding from what is transitory and accidental; we cannot be\r\nexpected to discover things absolutely new; it suffices to give to\r\nwhat is true a perfect expression. Unhappily, human nature, as\r\nunderstood by Boileau, included little beyond the court and the town.\r\nUnhappily his appreciation of classical literature was defective;\r\nto justify as true and natural the mythology of Greece he has to regard\r\nit as a body of symbols or a moral allegory. Unhappily his survey\r\nof literature was too narrow to include the truths and the splendours\r\nof Mediaeval poetry and art. For historical truth, indeed, he had\r\nlittle sense; seeking for what is permanent and universal, he had\r\nlittle regard for local colour and the truth of manners. To secure\r\nassent from contemporary minds truth must assume what they take to\r\nbe its image, and a Greek or Roman on the stage must not shock the\r\ndemand for verisimilitude made by the courtly imagination of the days\r\nof Louis Quatorze. Art which fails to please is no longer art.\r\n\r\nTo the workmanship, the technique of poetry, Boileau attaches a high\r\nimportance. Its several species--idyl, elegy, ode, sonnet, epigram,\r\nrondeau, ballade, madrigal, satire, epic, tragedy, comedy--are\r\nseparated from one another by fixed boundaries, and each is subject\r\nto its own rules; but genius, on occasion, may transcend those rules,\r\nand snatch an unauthorised grace. It is difficult to understand why\r\nfrom among the _genres_ of poetry Boileau omitted the fable; perhaps\r\nhe did not regard its form, now in verse and now in prose, as defined;\r\npossibly he was insensible of the perfection to which the fable in\r\nverse had been carried by La Fontaine. The fourth _chant_ of the _Art\r\nPoetique_ is remarkable for its lofty conception of the position of\r\nthe poet; its counsels express the dignity of the writer's own\r\nliterary life. He has been charged not only with cruelty as a satirist,\r\nbut with the baseness of a flatterer of the great. It would be more\r\njust to notice the honourable independence which he maintained,\r\nnotwithstanding his poetical homage to the King, which was an\r\ninevitable requisition. Boileau's influence as a critic of\r\nliterature can hardly be overrated; it has much in common with the\r\ninfluence of Pope on English literature--beneficial as regards his\r\nown time, somewhat restrictive and even tyrannical upon later\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\n_Le Lutrin_ (completed in 1683) is not a burlesque which degrades\r\na noble theme, but, like Pope's far more admirable _Rape of the Lock_,\r\na heroi-comic poem humorously exalting humble matter of the day. It\r\ntells of the combats of ecclesiastics respecting the position of a\r\nlectern, combats in which the books of a neighbouring publisher serve\r\nas formidable projectiles. The scene is in the Sainte-Chapelle and\r\nthe Palais de Justice. Boileau's gift for the vivid presentation of\r\nvisible detail, and his skill in versification, served him here better\r\nthan did his choice of a subject. On the whole, we think of him less\r\nas a poet than as the classical guardian and legislator of poetry.\r\nHe was an emancipator by directing art towards reason and truth; when\r\nlarger interpretations of truth and reason than his became possible,\r\nhis influence acted unfavourably as a constraint.\r\n\r\nAll that Boileau lacked as a poet was possessed by the most easy and\r\nnatural of the singers of his time--one whose art is like nature in\r\nits freedom, while yet it never wrongs the delicate bounds of art.\r\nJEAN DE LA FONTAINE was born in 1621 at Chateau-Thierry, in Champagne,\r\nson of the \"maitre des eaux et forets.\" His education was less of\r\na scholastic kind than an education derived from books read for his\r\nown pleasure, and especially from observation or reverie among the\r\nwoods and fields, with their population of bird, beast, and insect,\r\nso dear to his heart and his imagination. Slipping away from theology\r\nand law, he passed ten years, from twenty-three to thirty-three, in\r\nseeming indolence, a \"bon garcon,\" irreclaimably wayward as regards\r\nworldly affairs, but already drawing in to himself all that fed his\r\ngenius, all sights and sounds of nature, all the lore of old poets,\r\nstory-tellers, translators, and already practising his art of verse.\r\nNothing that was not natural to him, and wholly to his liking, would\r\nhe or could he do; but happily he was born to write perfect verses,\r\nand the labour of the artist was with him an instinct and a delight.\r\nHe allowed himself to be married to a pretty girl of fifteen, and\r\npresently forgot that he had a wife and child, drifted away, and agreed\r\nin 1659 to a division of goods; but his carelessness and egoism were\r\nwithout a touch of malignity, those of an overgrown child rather than\r\nof a man.\r\n\r\nIn 1654 he published a translation of the _Eunuch_ of Terence of small\r\nworth, and not long after was favoured with the patronage of Fouquet,\r\nthe superintendant of finance. To him La Fontaine presented his\r\n_Adonis_, a narrative poem, graceful, picturesque, harmonious,\r\nexpressing a delicate feeling for external nature rarely to be found\r\nin poetry of the time, and reviving some of the bright Renaissance\r\nsense of antiquity. The genius of France is united in La Fontaine's\r\nwritings with the genius of Greece. But the verses written by command\r\nfor Fouquet are laboured and ineffective. His ill-constructed and\r\nunfinished _Songe de Vaux_, partly in prose, partly in verse, was\r\ndesigned to celebrate his patron's Chateau de Vaux.\r\n\r\nFar happier than this is the poem in dialogue _Clymene_, a dramatic\r\nfantasy, in which Apollo on Mount Parnassus learns by the aid of the\r\nMuses the loves of Acante (La Fontaine) and Clymene (Madame X ...),\r\na rural beauty, whom the god had seen wandering on the banks of\r\nHippocrene. On the fall of his magnificent patron La Fontaine did\r\nnot desert him, pleading in his _Elegie aux Nymphes de Vaux_ on behalf\r\nof the disgraced minister. As a consequence, the poet retired for\r\na time from Paris to banishment at Limoges. But in 1664 he is again\r\nin Paris or at Chateau-Thierry, his native place, where the Duchesse\r\nde Bouillon, niece of Mazarin, young, gay, pleasure-loving, bestowed\r\non him a kind protection. His tedious paraphrase of _Psyche_, and\r\nthe poem _Quinquina_, in which he celebrates the recovery from illness\r\nof the Duchess, were performances of duty and gratitude rather than\r\nof native impulse; but the tendencies of her salon, restrained neither\r\nby the proprieties of the classical doctrine in literature nor those\r\nof religious strictness, may have encouraged him to the production\r\nof his _Contes_.\r\n\r\nIn Paris, from 1661 to 1664 joyous meetings took place in Boileau's\r\nrooms in the Rue du Colombier of a distinguished group, which included\r\nMoliere, Chapelle, Racine, and La Fontaine. La Fontaine, the\r\n_bonhomme_, who escaped from the toil of conversation which did not\r\ninterest him in shy or indolent taciturnity, could be a charming\r\ntalker with companions of his choice. Probably to Boileau's urgency\r\nis due the first original publication of La Fontaine, a little volume\r\nof _Nouvelles en Vers_ (1664-1665), containing the _Joconde_, a tale\r\nfrom Ariosto, and a comic story versified from Boccaccio. Almost\r\nimmediately there followed a collection of ten _Contes_, with the\r\nauthor's name upon the title-page, and at various later dates were\r\npublished added tales, until five parts completed the series. The\r\nsuccess was great, but great also was the scandal, for the _bonhomme_,\r\ndrawing from Boccaccio, the Heptameron, the Cent Nouvelles nouvelles,\r\nRabelais, Petronius, Athenaeus, and other sources, had exhibited no\r\nmore regard for decency than that which bestows the graces of\r\nlightness, brightness, wit, and gaiety upon indecency. His unabashed\r\napology was that the artistic laws of the _conte_ obliged him to\r\ndecline the laws of modesty; and among those who applauded his tales\r\nwere the Duchess de Bouillon and Mme. de Sevigne. It is indeed\r\nimpossible not to applaud their skill in rapid and easy narrative,\r\nand the grace, freedom, and spontaneity of the verse.\r\n\r\nThe first six books of the _Fables_ appeared in 1668; the next five\r\nin two parts, in 1678 and 1679; the twelfth and last book in 1694.\r\nWhen the _Psyche_ was published, soon after the first group of the\r\n_Fables_, the prose and verse were placed in a graceful setting, which\r\ntells of the converse of the author with his friends Boileau, Racine,\r\nand Moliere (or possibly Chapelle) in the midst of the unfinished\r\ngardens of Versailles, where the author of _Psyche_, named happily\r\nPolyphile (for he loved many things, and among them his friends),\r\nwill read his romance for his literary comrades.\r\n\r\n   \"_J'aime le jeu, l'amour, les livres, la musique,\r\n    La ville et la campagne, enfin tout: il n'est rien\r\n        Qui ne me soit souverain bien\r\n    Jusq'aux sombres plaisirs d'un coeur melancolique._\"\r\n\r\nSome of his friends before long had passed away, but others came to\r\nfill their places. For many years he was cared for and caressed by\r\nthe amiable and cultivated Mme. de Sabliere, and when she dismissed\r\nother acquaintances she still kept \"her dog, her cat, and her La\r\nFontaine.\" The Academy would have opened its doors to him sooner than\r\nto Boileau, but the King would not have it so, and he was admitted\r\n(1684) only when he had promised Louis XIV. henceforth to be _sage_.\r\nWhen Mme. de Sabliere died, Hervart, maitre des requetes, one day\r\noffered La Fontaine the hospitality of his splendid house. \"I was\r\non my way there,\" replied the poet. After a season of conversion,\r\nin which he expressed penitence for his \"infamous book\" of _Contes_,\r\nthe _bonhomme_ tranquilly died in April 1693. \"He is so simple,\" said\r\nhis nurse, \"that God will not have courage to damn him.\" \"He was the\r\nmost sincere and candid soul,\" wrote his friend Maucroix, who had\r\nbeen intimate with him for more than fifty years, \"that I have ever\r\nknown; never a disguise; I don't know that he spoke an untruth in\r\nall his life.\"\r\n\r\nAll that is best in the genius of La Fontaine may be found in his\r\n_Fables_. The comedies in which he collaborated, the _Captivite de\r\nSaint Malc_, written on the suggestion of the Port-Royalists, the\r\nmiscellaneous poems, though some of these are admirable, even the\r\n_Contes_, exhibit only a fragment of his mind; in the _Fables_ the\r\nplay of his faculties is exquisite, and is complete. His imagination\r\nwas unfitted for large and sustained creation; it operated most\r\nhappily in a narrow compass. The _Fables_, however, contain much in\r\nlittle; they unite an element of drama and of lyric with narrative;\r\nthey give scope to his feeling for nature, and to his gift for the\r\nobservation of human character and society; they form, as he himself\r\nhas said--\r\n\r\n   \"_Une ample comedie a cents actes divers\r\n    Et dont la scene est l'univers._\"\r\n\r\nHe had not to invent his subjects; he found them in all the fabulists\r\nwho had preceded him--Greek, Latin, Oriental, elder French\r\nwriters--\"j'en lis qui sont du Nord et qui sont du Midi;\" but he may\r\nbe said to have recreated the species. From an apologue, tending to\r\nan express moral, he converted the fable into a _conte_, in which\r\nnarrative, description, observation, satire, dialogue have an\r\nindependent value, and the moral is little more than an accident.\r\nThis is especially true of the midmost portion of the collection--Books\r\nvii.-ix.--which appeared ten years after the earliest group. He does\r\nnot impose new and great ideas on the reader; he does not interpret the\r\ndeepest passions; he takes life as he sees it, as an entertaining\r\ncomedy, touched at times with serious thought, with pathos, even with\r\nmelancholy, but in the main a comedy, which teaches us to smile at the\r\nvanities, the follies, the egoisms of mankind, and teaches us at the\r\nsame time something of tenderness and pity for all that is gentle or\r\nweak. His morality is amiable and somewhat epicurean, a morality of\r\nindulgence, of moderation, of good sense. His eye for what is\r\ncharacteristic and picturesque in animal life is infallible; but his\r\nhumanised wild creatures are also a playful, humorous, ironical\r\npresentation of mankind and of the society of his own day, from the\r\ngrand monarch to the bourgeois or the lackey.\r\n\r\nLa Fontaine's language escapes from the limitations of the classical\r\nschool of the seventeenth century; his manifold reading in elder\r\nFrench literature enriched his vocabulary; he seems to light by\r\ninstinct upon the most exact and happiest word. Yet we know that the\r\nperfection of his art was attained only as the result of untiring\r\ndiligence; indolent and careless as he was in worldly affairs, he\r\nwas an indefatigable craftsman in poetry. His verse is as free as\r\nit is fine; it can accomplish whatever it intends; now it is light\r\nand swift, but when needful it can be grave and even magnificent:\r\n\r\n   \"_Aurait-il imprime sur le front des etoiles\r\n    Ce que la nuit des temps enferme dans ses voiles?_\"\r\n\r\nIt is verse which depends on no mechanical rules imposed from without;\r\nits life and movement come from within, and the lines vary, like a\r\nbreeze straying among blossoms, with every stress or relaxation of\r\nthe writer's mood. While La Fontaine derives much from antiquity,\r\nhe may be regarded as incarnating more than any other writer of his\r\ncentury the genius of France, exquisite in the proportion of his\r\nfeeling and the expression of feeling to its source and cause. If\r\nwe do not name him, with some of his admirers, \"the French Homer,\"\r\nwe may at least describe him, with Nisard, as a second Montaigne,\r\n\"mais plus doux, plus aimable, plus naif que le premier,\" and with\r\nall the charm of verse superadded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\nCOMEDY AND TRAGEDY--MOLIERE--RACINE\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe history of comedy, from Larivey to Moliere, is one of arrested\r\ndevelopment, followed by hasty and ill-regulated growth. During the\r\nfirst twenty-five years of the seventeenth century, comedy can hardly\r\nbe said to have existed; whatever tended to beauty or elevation, took\r\nthe form of tragi-comedy or pastoral; what was rude and popular became\r\na farce. From the farce Moliere's early work takes its origin, but\r\nof the repertory of his predecessors little survives. Much, indeed,\r\nin these performances was left to the improvisation of the burlesque\r\nactors. Gros-Guillaume, Gaultier-Garguille, Turlupin, Tabarin,\r\nrejoiced the heart of the populace; but the _farces tabariniques_\r\ncan hardly be dignified with the name of literature.\r\n\r\nIn 1632 the comedy of intrigue was advanced by Mairet in his\r\n_Galanteries du Duc d'Ossone_. The genius of Rotrou, follower though\r\nhe was of Plautus, tended towards the tragic; if he is really gay,\r\nit is in _La Soeur_ (1645), a bright tangle of extravagant incidents.\r\nFor Rotrou the drama of Italy supplied material; the way to the Spanish\r\ndrama was opened by d'Ouville, the only writer of the time devoted\r\nspecially to comedy, in _L'Esprit Follet_ (1641); once opened, it\r\nbecame a common highway. Scarron added to his Spanish originals in\r\n_Jodelet_ and _Don Japhet d'Armenie_ his own burlesque humour. The\r\ncomedy of contemporary manners appears with grace and charm in\r\nCorneille's early plays; the comedy of character, in his admirable\r\n_Le Menteur_. Saint-Evremond satirised literary affectations in _La\r\nComedie des Academistes_; these and other follies of the time are\r\npresented with spirit in Desmaret's remarkable comedy, _Les\r\nVisionnaires_. If we add, for sake of its study of the peasant in\r\nthe character of Mathieu Gareau, the farcical _Pedant Joue_ of Cyrano,\r\nwe have named the most notable comedies of the years which preceded\r\n_Les Precieuses Ridicules_.\r\n\r\nTheir general character is extravagance of resources in the plot,\r\nextravagance of conception in the characters. Yet in both intrigue\r\nand characters there is a certain monotony. The same incidents,\r\nromantic and humorous, are variously mingled to produce the\r\nimbroglio; the same typical characters--the braggart, the parasite,\r\nthe pedant, the extravagant poet, the amorous old man, the designing\r\nwoman, the knavish valet, the garrulous nurse--play their mirthful\r\nparts. If the types are studied from real life rather than adopted\r\nfrom Italian or Spanish models, they are exaggerated to absurdity.\r\nCorneille alone is distinguished by delicacy of imagination and the\r\nfiner touch of a dexterous artist.\r\n\r\nJEAN-BAPTISTE POQUELIN, who, when connected with the stage, named\r\nhimself MOLIERE, was born in January 1622, in Paris, the son of a\r\nprosperous upholsterer, Jean Poquelin, and Marie Cresse, his wife.\r\nEducated at the College de Clermont, he had among his fellow-pupils\r\nthe Prince de Conti, Chapelle, the future poet Hesnault, the future\r\ntraveller Bernier. There seems to be no sufficient reason to doubt\r\nthat he and some of his friends afterwards received lessons in\r\nphilosophy from Gassendi, whose influence must have tended to loosen\r\nhim from the traditional doctrines, and to encourage independence\r\nof thought. A translation by Moliere of the great poem of Lucretius\r\nhas been lost, but a possible citation from it appears in the second\r\nact of the _Misanthrope_. Legal studies followed those of philosophy.\r\nBut Moliere had other ends in view than either those of an advocate\r\nor of the hereditary office of upholsterer to the King. In 1643, at\r\nthe age of twenty-one, he decided to throw in his lot with the\r\ntheatrical company in which Madeleine Bejart and her brothers were\r\nleading members. The _Illustre Theatre_ was constituted, but Paris\r\nlooked askance at the illustrious actors; debt, imprisonment, and\r\nrelease through friendly aid, formed the net result of Moliere's first\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nThe troupe decided at the close of 1645 or in the early days of the\r\nfollowing year to try their fortune in the provinces. It is needless\r\nto follow in detail their movements during twelve years--twelve years\r\nfruitful in experience for one who observed life with keenest eyes,\r\nyears of toil, in which the foundations of his art were laid. At Lyons,\r\nprobably in 1655, possibly in 1653, a comedy, founded on the Italian\r\nof Nicolo Barbieri, _L'Etourdi_, saw the light, and Moliere revealed\r\nhimself as a poet. Young Lelie, the _Etourdi_, is enamoured of the\r\nbeautiful Celie, whom the merchant Trufaldin, old and rich, has\r\npurchased from corsairs. Lelie's valet Mascarille, who is the life\r\nof the play, invents stratagem on stratagem to aid the lover, and\r\nis for ever foiled by his master's indiscretions, until the inevitable\r\nhappy denouement arrives. The romantic intrigue is conventional; the\r\ncharm is in the vivacity and colour of the style. In 1656 _Le Depit\r\nAmoureux_ was given with applause at Beziers; much is derived from\r\nthe Italian of Secchi, something perhaps from Terence; the tender\r\nscenes of lovers' quarrels and lovers' reconciliation, contrasting\r\nwith the franker comedy of the loves of waiting-maid and valet, still\r\nlive, if the rest of the play be little remembered.\r\n\r\nThe years of apprenticeship were over when, in 1658, Moliere and his\r\ncompany once more in Paris presented, by command, before the King,\r\nCorneille's _Nicomede_, and, leave being granted, gave his farce in\r\nthe Italian style, the _Docteur Amoureux_, before pleased spectators.\r\nThe company was now the troupe of Monsieur, the King's brother, with\r\nthe Petit-Bourbon as theatre, and there, in November 1659, was enacted\r\nMoliere's first satiric play on contemporary manners, _Les\r\nPrecieuses Ridicules_. We do not need the legendary old man crying\r\nfrom the pit \"Courage, Moliere! voila la bonne comedie\" to assure\r\nus that the comic stage possessed at length a masterpiece. The\r\ndramatist had himself known the precieuses of the provinces; through\r\nthem he might with less danger exhibit the follies of the Hotel de\r\nRambouillet and the _ruelles_ of the capital. The good bourgeois\r\nGorgibus is induced by his niece and daughter, two precieuses, to\r\nestablish himself in Paris. Their aspirant lovers, unversed in the\r\naffectations of the salon, are slighted and repelled; in revenge they\r\nemploy their valets, Mascarille and Jodelet, to play the parts of\r\nmen of fashion and of taste. The exposure and confusion of the ladies,\r\nwith an indignant rebuke from Gorgibus, close the piece. It was a\r\nfarce raised to the dignity of comedy. Moliere's triumph was the\r\ntriumph of good sense.\r\n\r\nAfter a success in _Sganarelle_ (1660), a broad comedy of vulgar\r\njealousy, and a decided check--the only one in his dramatic career--in\r\nthe somewhat colourless tragi-comedy _Don Garcie de Navarre_ (1661),\r\nMoliere found a theme, suggested by the Adelphi of Terence, which\r\nwas happily suited to his genius. _L'Ecole des Maris_ (1661) contrasts\r\ntwo methods of education--one suspicious and severe, the other wisely\r\nindulgent. Two brothers, Ariste and Sganarelle, seek the hands of\r\ntheir wards, the orphan sisters Isabelle and Leonor; the amiable\r\nAriste, aided by the good sense of a gay soubrette, is rewarded with\r\nhappiness; the vexatious Sganarelle is put to confusion. The drama\r\nis a plea, expressing the writer's personal thoughts, for nature and\r\nfor freedom. The comedy of manners is here replaced by the comedy\r\nof character. Its success suggested to Fouquet that Moliere might\r\ncontribute to the amusement of the King at the fetes of the Chateau\r\nde Vaux; in fifteen days the dramatist had his bright improvisation\r\n_Les Facheux_ ready, a series of character sketches in scenes rather\r\nthan a comedy. The King smiled approval, and, it was whispered, hinted\r\nto Moliere that another bore might with advantage be added to the\r\ncollection--the sportsman whose talk shall be of sport. At\r\nFontainebleau he duly appeared before his Majesty, and unkind\r\nspectators recognised a portrait of the Marquis de Soyecourt.\r\n\r\nNext February (1662) Moliere, aged forty, was married to the actress\r\nArmande Bejart, whose age was half his own--a disastrous union, which\r\ncaused him inexpressible anxiety and unhappiness. In _L'Ecole des\r\nFemmes_ of the same year he is wiser than he had shown himself in\r\nactual life. Arnolphe would train a model wife from childhood by the\r\nmethod of jealous seclusion and in infantile ignorance; but love,\r\nin the person of young Horace, finds out a way. There is pathos in\r\nthe anguish of Arnolphe; yet it is not the order of nature that\r\nmiddle-aged folks should practise perverting arts upon innocent\r\naffections. The charming Agnes belongs of right to Horace, and the\r\nover-wise, and therefore foolish, Arnolphe must quit the scene with\r\nhis despairing cry. Some matter of offence was found by the devout\r\nin Moliere's play; it was the opening of a long campaign; the\r\n_precieuses_, the dainty gentle-folk, the critical disciples of\r\nAristotle, the rival comedians, were up in arms. Moliere for the\r\noccasion ignored the devout; upon the others he made brilliant\r\nreprisals in _La Critique de l'Ecole des Femmes_ (1663) and\r\n_L'Impromptu de Versailles_ (1663).\r\n\r\nAmong those who war against nature and human happiness, not the least\r\ndangerous foe is the religious hypocrite. On May 12, 1664, Moliere\r\npresented before the King the first three acts of his great\r\ncharacter-comedy _Tartufe_. Instantly Anne of Austria and the King's\r\nconfessor, now Archbishop of Paris, set to work; the public\r\nperformance of \"The Hypocrite\" was inhibited; a savage pamphlet was\r\ndirected against its author by the cure of Saint-Barthelemy. Private\r\nrepresentations, however, were given; _Tartufe_, in five acts, was\r\nplayed in November in presence of the great Conde. In 1665 Moliere's\r\ncompany was named the servants of the King; two years later a verbal\r\npermission was granted for the public performance of the play. It\r\nappeared under the title of _L'Imposteur_; the victory seemed won,\r\nwhen again, and without delay, the blow fell; by order of the President,\r\nM. de Lamoignon, the theatre was closed. Moliere bore up courageously.\r\nThe King was besieging Lille; Moliere despatched two of his comrades\r\nto the camp, declaring that if the Tartufes of France should carry\r\nall before them he must cease to write. The King was friendly, but\r\nthe Archbishop fulminated threats of excommunication against any one\r\nwho should even read the play. At length in 1669, when circumstances\r\nwere more favourable, Louis XIV. granted the desired permission; in\r\nits proper name Moliere's play obtained complete freedom. Bourdaloue\r\nmight still pronounce condemnation; Bossuet might draw terrible\r\nmorals from the author's sudden death; an actor, armed with the sword\r\nof the comic spirit, had proved victorious. And yet the theologians\r\nwere not wholly wrong; the tendency of Moliere's teaching, like that\r\nof Rabelais and like that of Montaigne, is to detach morals from\r\nreligion, to vindicate whatever is natural, to regard good sense and\r\ngood feeling as sufficient guides of conduct.\r\n\r\nThere is an accent of indignation in the play; the follies of men\r\nand women may be subjects of sport; base egoism assuming the garb\r\nof religion deserves a lash that draws the blood. Is it no act of\r\nnatural piety to defend the household against the designs of greedy\r\nand sensual imposture; no service to society to quicken the\r\npenetration of those who may be made the dupes of selfish craft? While\r\nOrgan and his mother are besotted by the gross pretensions of the\r\nhypocrite, while the young people contend for the honest joy of life,\r\nthe voice of philosophic wisdom is heard through the sagacious Cleante,\r\nand that of frank good sense through the waiting-maid, Dorine.\r\nSuddenly a providence, not divine but human, intervenes in the\r\nrepresentative of the monarch and the law, and the criminal at the\r\nmoment of triumph is captured in his own snare.\r\n\r\nWhen the affair of _Tartufe_ was in its first tangle, Moliere produced\r\na kind of dramatic counterpart--_Don Juan, ou le Festin de Pierre_\r\n(1665). In Don Juan--whose valet Sganarelle is the faithful critic\r\nof his master--the dramatist presented one whose cynical incredulity\r\nand scorn of all religion are united with the most complete moral\r\nlicence; but hypocrisy is the fashion of the day, and Don Juan in\r\nsheer effrontery will invest himself for an hour in the robe of a\r\npenitent. Atheist and libertine as he is, there is a certain glamour\r\nof reckless courage about the figure of his hero, recreated by Moliere\r\nfrom a favourite model of Spanish origin. His comedy, while a vigorous\r\nstudy of character, is touched with the light of romance.\r\n\r\nThese are masterpieces; but neither _Tartufe_ nor _Don Juan_\r\nexpresses so much of the mind of Moliere as does _Le Misanthrope_\r\n(1666). His private griefs, his public warfare, had doubtless a little\r\nhardened and a little embittered his spirit. In many respects it is\r\na sorry world; and yet we must keep on terms with it. The misanthropist\r\nAlceste is nobly fanatical on behalf of sincerity and rectitude. How\r\ndoes his sincerity serve the world or serve himself? And he, too,\r\nhas his dose of human folly, for is he not enamoured of a heartless\r\ncoquette? Philinte is accommodating, and accepts the world for what\r\nit is; and yet, we might ask, is there not a more settled misanthropy\r\nin such cynical acquiescence than there is in the intractable virtue\r\nof Alceste? Alone of Moliere's plays, _Le Misanthrope_ has that\r\nShakespearean obscurity which leaves it open to various\r\ninterpretations. It is idle to try to discover actual originals for\r\nthe characters. But we may remember that when Alceste cried to\r\nCelimene, \"C'est pour mes peches que je vous aime,\" the actors who\r\nstood face to face were Moliere and the wife whom he now met only\r\non the stage.\r\n\r\nMoliere's genius could achieve nothing higher than _Tartufe_ and the\r\n_Misanthrope_. His powers suffered no decline, but he did not again\r\nput them to such strenuous uses. In 1668 the brilliant fantasy of\r\n_Amphitryon_, freely derived from Plautus, was succeeded by an\r\nadmirable comedy in prose, _Georges Dandin_, in which the folly of\r\nunequal marriage between the substantial farmer and the fine lady\r\nis mocked with bitter gaiety. Before the year closed Moliere,\r\ncontinuing to write in prose, returned to Plautus, and surpassed him\r\nin _L'Avare_. To be rich and miserly is in itself a form of fatuity;\r\nbut Harpagon is not only miserly but amorous, as far as a ruling\r\npassion will admit one of subordinate influence. _Le Bourgeois\r\nGentilhomme_ (1670), a lesson of good sense to those who suffer from\r\nthe social ambition to rise above their proper rank, is wholly\r\noriginal; it mounts in the close from comedy to the extravagance of\r\nfarce, and perhaps in the uproarious laughter of the play we may\r\ndiscover a touch of effort or even of spasm. The operatic _Psyche_\r\n(1671) is memorable as having combined the talents of Moliere,\r\nCorneille, and Quinault, with the added musical gifts of Lulli.\r\n\r\nIn _Les Femmes Savantes_ (1672) Moliere returned to an early theme,\r\nwith variations suited to the times. The Hotel de Rambouillet was\r\nclosed; the new tribe of _precieuses_ had learnt the Cartesian\r\nphilosophy, affected the sciences, were patronesses of physics,\r\nastronomy, anatomy. Something of the old romantic follies survived,\r\nand mingled strangely with the pretensions to science and the\r\npedantries of erudition. Trissotin (doubtless a portrait in\r\ncaricature from the Abbe Cotin) is the Tartufe of spurious culture;\r\nVadius (a possible satire of Menage) is a pedant, arrogant and brutal.\r\nShall the charming Henriette be sacrificed to gratify her mother's\r\ndomineering temper and the base designs of an impostor? The forces\r\nare arrayed on either side; the varieties of learned and elegant folly\r\nin woman are finely distinguished; of the opposite party are Chrysale,\r\nthe bourgeois father with his rude common-sense; the sage Ariste;\r\nthe faithful servant, Martine, whose grammar may be faulty, but whose\r\nwit is sound and clear; and Henriette herself, the adorable, whom\r\nto know is more of a liberal education than to have explored all the\r\nGreek and Latin masters of Vadius and Trissotin. The final issue of\r\nthe encounter between good sense, good nature, reason and folly,\r\npedantry and pride, cannot be uncertain.\r\n\r\n_Le Malade Imaginaire_ was written when Moliere was suffering from\r\nillness; but his energy remained indomitable. The comedy continued\r\nthat long polemic against the medical faculty which he had sustained\r\nin _L'Amour Medecin_, _Monsieur de Pourceaugnac_, and other plays.\r\nMoliere had little faith in any art which professes to mend nature;\r\nthe physicians were the impostors of a learned hygiene. It was the\r\ndramatist's last jest at the profession. While playing the part of\r\nArgan on February 17, 1673, the \"Malade Imaginaire\" fell dying on\r\nthe stage; he forced a laugh, but could not continue his part; at\r\nten o'clock he was no more. Through the exertions of his widow a\r\nreligious funeral was permitted to an actor who had died unfortified\r\nby the rites of the Church.\r\n\r\nMany admirable though slighter pieces served as the relief of his\r\nmind between the effort of his chief works. In all, gaiety and good\r\nsense interpenetrate each other. Kindly natured and generous,\r\nMoliere, a great observer, who looked through the deeds of men, was\r\noften taciturn--_le contemplateur_ of Boileau--and seemingly\r\nself-absorbed. Like many persons of artistic temperament, he loved\r\nsplendour of life; but he was liberal in his largess to those who\r\nclaimed his help. He brought comedy to nature, and made it a study\r\nof human life. His warfare was against all that is unreal and unnatural.\r\nHe preached the worth of human happiness, good sense, moderation,\r\nhumorous tolerance. He does not indulge in heroics, and yet there\r\nis heroism in his courageous outlook upon things. The disciple of\r\nMoliere cannot idealise the world into a scene of fairyland; he will\r\nconceive man as far from perfect, perhaps as far from perfectible;\r\nbut the world is our habitation; let us make it a cheerful one with\r\nthe aid of a sane temper and an energetic will. As a writer, Moliere\r\nis not free from faults; but his defects of style are like the\r\naccidents that happen within the bounds of a wide empire. His stature\r\nis not diminished when he is placed among the greatest European\r\nfigures. \"I read some pieces of Moliere's every year,\" said Goethe,\r\n\"just as from time to time I contemplate the engravings after the\r\ngreat Italian masters. For we little men are not able to retain the\r\ngreatness of such things within ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nTo study the contemporaries and immediate successors of Moliere in\r\ncomedy--Thomas Corneille, Quinault, Montfleury, Boursault,\r\nBaron--would be to show how his genius dominates that of all his\r\nfellows. The reader may well take this fact for granted.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: An excellent guide will be found in Victor Fournel's\r\n_Le Theatre au xvii. Siecle, La Comedie_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWith the close of the sanguinary follies of the Fronde, with the\r\ninauguration of the personal government of Louis XIV. and the triumph\r\nof an absolute monarchy, a period of social and political\r\nreorganisation began. The court became the centre for literature;\r\nto please courtiers and great ladies was to secure prosperity and\r\nfame; the arts of peace were magnificently ordered; the conditions\r\nwere favourable to ideals of grace and beauty rather than of proud\r\nsublimity; to isolate one's self was impossible; literature became\r\nthe pastime of a cultivated society; it might be a trivial pastime,\r\nbut in fitting hands it might become a noble pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe easier part was chosen by PHILIPPE QUINAULT, the more arduous\r\nby Racine. Quinault (1635-88) had given his first comedy as early\r\nas 1653; in tragedies and tragi-comedies which followed, he heaped\r\nup melodramatic incidents, but could not base them upon characters\r\nstrongly conceived, or passion truly felt. A frigid sentimentality\r\nreplaces passion, and this is expressed with languorous monotony.\r\nLove reigns supreme in his theatre; but love, as interpreted by\r\nQuinault, is a kind of dulcet gallantry. His tragedy _Astrate_ (1663)\r\nwas not the less popular because its sentiment was in the conventional\r\nmode. One comedy by Quinault, _La Mere Coquette_, is happy in its\r\nplot and in its easy style. But he did not find his true direction\r\nuntil he declined--or should we rather say, until he rose?--into the\r\nlibrettist for the operas of Lulli. His lyric gifts were considerable;\r\nhe could manipulate his light and fragile material with extraordinary\r\nskill. The tests of truth and reality were not applied to such verse;\r\nif it was decorative, the listeners were satisfied. The opera\r\nflourished, and literature suffered through its pseudo-poetics. But\r\nthe libretti of Quinault and the ballets of Benserade are\r\nrepresentative of the time, and in his mythological or chivalric\r\ninventions Benserade sometimes could attain to the poetry of graceful\r\nfantasy.\r\n\r\nQuinault retired from the regular drama almost at the moment when\r\nRacine appeared. Born at La Ferte-Milon in 1639, son of a procureur\r\nand comptroller of salt, JEAN RACINE lost both parents while a child.\r\nHis widowed grandmother retired to Port-Royal in 1649. After six\r\nyears' schooling at Beauvais the boy passed into the tutelage of the\r\nJansenists, and among his instructors was the devout and learned\r\nNicole. Solitude, religion, the abbey woods, Virgil, Sophocles,\r\nEuripides--these were the powers that fostered his genius. Already\r\nhe was experimenting in verse. At nineteen he continued his studies\r\nin Paris, where the little abbe Le Vasseur, who knew the _salons_\r\nand haunted the theatre, introduced him to mundane pleasures.\r\nRacine's sensitive, mobile character could easily adapt itself to\r\nthe world. His ode on the marriage of the King, _La Nymphe de la Seine_,\r\ncorrected by Chapelain (for to bring Tritons into a river was highly\r\nimproper), won him a gift of louis d'or. But might not the world\r\ncorrupt the young Port-Royalist's innocence? The company of ladies\r\nof the Marais Theatre and that of La Fontaine might not tend to\r\nedification. So thought Racine's aunts; and, with the expectation\r\nthat he would take orders, he was exiled to Uzes, where his uncle\r\nwas vicar-general, and where the nephew could study the _Summa_ of\r\ntheology, but also the Odyssey, the odes of Pindar, Petrarch, and\r\nthe pretty damsels who prayed in the cathedral church.\r\n\r\nIn 1663 he was again in Paris, was present at royal levees, and in\r\nBoileau's chambers renewed his acquaintance with La Fontaine, and\r\nbecame a companion of Moliere. His vocation was not that of an\r\necclesiastic. Two dramatic works of earlier date are lost; his first\r\npiece that appeared before the public, _La Thebaide_, was presented\r\nin 1664 by Moliere's company. It is a tragedy written in discipleship\r\nto Rotrou and to Corneille, and the pupil was rather an imitator of\r\nCorneille's infirmities than of his excellences. _Alexandre_\r\nfollowed towards the close of the ensuing year--a feeble play, in\r\nwhich the mannered gallantry of the time was liberally transferred\r\nto the kings of India and their Macedonian conqueror. But amorous\r\nsighs were the mode, and there was a young grand monarch who might\r\ndiscover himself in the person of the magnanimous hero. The success\r\nwas great, though Saint-Evremond pronounced his censures, and\r\nCorneille found ridiculous the trophies erected upon the imagined\r\nruins of his own. Discontented with the performers at the Palais-Royal,\r\nRacine offered his play to the Hotel de Bourgogne; Moliere's best\r\nactress seceded to the rival house. Racine's ambition may excuse,\r\nbut cannot justify an injurious act; a breach between the friends\r\nwas inevitable.\r\n\r\nBoileau remained now, as ever, loyal--loyal for warning as well as\r\nfor encouragement. Nicole, the former guide of Racine's studies, in\r\nhis _Visionnaires_, had spoken of dramatic poets as \"public\r\npoisoners.\" The reproach was taken to himself by Racine, and in two\r\nletters, written with some of the spirit of the _Provinciales_, he\r\nturned his wit against his Jansenist friends. Thanks to Boileau's\r\nwise and firm counsel, the second of these remained unpublished.\r\n\r\nMadame de Sevigne was the devoted admirer of the great Corneille,\r\nbut when she witnessed his young rival's _Andromaque_ she yielded\r\nto its pathos six reluctant tears. On its first appearance in 1667\r\na triumph almost equal to that of the _Cid_ was secured. Never before\r\nhad grace and passion, art and nature, ideality and truth, been so\r\nunited in the theatre of France. Racine did not seek for novelty in\r\nthe choice of a subject; Euripides had made Andromache familiar to\r\nthe Greek stage. The invention of Racine was of a subtler kind than\r\nthat which manufactures incidents and constructs a plot. Like Raphael\r\nin the art of painting, he could accept a well-known theme and renew\r\nit by the finest processes of genius. He did not need an extraordinary\r\naction, or personages of giant proportions; the simpler the intrigue,\r\nthe better could he concentrate the interest on the states of a soul;\r\nthe more truly and deeply human the characters, the more apt were\r\nthey for betraying the history of a passion. In its purity of outline,\r\nits harmony of proportions, _Andromaque_ was Greek; in its sentiment,\r\nit gained something from Christian culture; in its manners, there\r\nwas a certain reflection of the Versailles of Louis XIV. It was at\r\nonce classical and modern, and there was no discordance between\r\nqualities which had been rendered, to borrow a word from Shakespeare,\r\n\"harmonious charmingly.\" With _Andromaque_ French tragedy ceased to\r\nbe oratorical, and became essentially poetic.\r\n\r\nAdversaries there were, such as success calls forth; the irritable\r\npoet retorted with epigrams of a kind which multiply and perpetuate\r\nenmities. His true reprisal was another work, _Britannicus_,\r\nestablishing his fame in another province of tragedy. But before\r\n_Britannicus_ appeared he had turned aside, as if his genius needed\r\nrecreation, to produce the comedy, or farce, or buffoonery, or\r\nbadinage, or mockery (for it is all these), _Les Plaideurs_. It may\r\nbe that his failure in a lawsuit moved Racine to have his jest at\r\nthe gentlemen of the Palais; he and his friends of the tavern of the\r\n_Mouton Blanc_--Furetiere among them--may have put their wits\r\ntogether to devise material for laughter, and discussed how far _The\r\nWasps_ of Aristophanes could be acclimatised in Paris. At first the\r\nburlesque was meant for an Italian troupe, but Scaramouche left the\r\ntown, and something more carefully developed would be expected at\r\nthe Hotel de Bourgogne. The play was received with hisses, but Moliere\r\ndid not fear to laugh at what was comic, whether he laughed according\r\nto the rules or against them. A month later, at a court performance,\r\nLouis XIV. laughed loudly; the courtiers quickly discovered Racine's\r\nwit, and the laughter was echoed by all loyal citizens. In truth,\r\nthere is laughing matter in the play; the professional enthusiasm\r\nof Dandin, the judge, who wears his robe and cap even in bed, the\r\nrage and rapture of litigation in Chicanneau and the Countess, have\r\nin them something of nature beneath the caricature; in the buffoonery\r\nthere is a certain extravagant grace.\r\n\r\n_Les Plaideurs_, however, was only an interlude between graver\r\nefforts. _Britannicus_ (1669), founded on the Annals of Tacitus,\r\nexhibits with masterly power Nero's adolescence in crime; the young\r\ntiger has grace and strength, but the instinct of blood needs only\r\nto be awakened within him. Agrippine is a superb incarnation of\r\nwomanly ambition, a Roman sister of Athalie. The play was at first\r\ncoldly received; Corneille and his cabal did not spare their censures.\r\nIn a preface Racine struck back, but afterwards repented of his bitter\r\nwords and withdrew them. The critics, as he says in a later preface,\r\ndisappeared; the piece remained. His conception of tragedy in\r\ncontrast with that of Corneille was defined by him in memorable\r\nwords--what is natural should be sought rather than what is\r\nextraordinary; the action should be simple, \"chargee de peu de\r\nmatiere\"; it should advance gradually towards the close, sustained\r\nby the interests, sentiments, and passions of the personages.\r\n\r\nThe sprightly Henrietta of England, Duchess of Orleans, seems to have\r\nconceived the idea of bringing the rivalry between the old dramatic\r\npoet and his young successor to a decisive test. She proposed to each,\r\nwithout the other's knowledge, a subject for a tragedy--the parting,\r\nfor reasons of State policy, of two royal lovers, Titus, Emperor of\r\nRome, and Berenice, Queen of Palestine. Perhaps Henrietta\r\nmischievously thought of the relations of her friend Marie de Mancini\r\nwith Louis XIV. The plays appeared almost simultaneously in November\r\n1670; Corneille's was before long withdrawn; Racine's _Berenice_,\r\nin which the penetrating voice of La Champmesle interpreted the\r\nsorrows of the heroine, obtained a triumph. Yet the elegiac subject\r\nis hardly suited to tragedy; a situation rather than an action is\r\npresented; it needed all the poet's resources to prevent the scenes\r\nfrom being stationary. In Berenice there is a suavity in grief which\r\ngives a grace to her passion; the play, if not a drama of power, is\r\nthe most charming of elegiac tragedies.\r\n\r\n_Bajazet_ (1672), a tragedy of the seraglio, although the role of\r\nthe hero is feeble, has virile qualities. The fury of Eastern passion,\r\na love resembling hate, is represented in the Sultana Roxane. In the\r\nVizier Acomat, deliberate in craft, intrepid in danger, Racine proved,\r\nas he proved by his Nero and his Joad, that he was not always doomed\r\nto fail in his characters of men. The historical events were\r\ncomparatively recent; but in the perspective of the theatre, distance\r\nmay produce the idealising effect of time. The story was perhaps found\r\nby Racine in _Floridon_, a tale by Segrais. The heroine of\r\n_Mithridate_ (1673), the noble daughter of Ephesus, Monime, queen\r\nand slave, is an ideal of womanly love, chastity, fidelity, sacrifice;\r\ngentle, submissive, and yet capable of lofty courage. The play unites\r\nthe passions of romance with a study of large political interests\r\nhardly surpassed by Corneille. The cabal which gathered head against\r\n_Bajazet_ could only whisper its malignities when _Mithridate_\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\n_Iphigenie_, which is freely imitated from Euripides, was given at\r\nthe fetes of Versailles in the summer of 1674. The French Iphigenia\r\nis enamoured of Achilles, and death means for her not only departure\r\nfrom the joy of youth and the light of the sun, but the loss of love.\r\nHere, as elsewhere, Racine complicates the moral situation with cross\r\nand counter loves: Eriphile is created to be the jealous rival of\r\nIphigenie, and to be her substitute in the sacrifice of death. The\r\ningenious transpositions, which were necessary to adapt a Greek play\r\nto Versailles in the second half of the seventeenth century, called\r\nforth hostile criticisms. Through miserable intrigues a competing\r\n_Iphigenie_, the work of Le Clerc and Coras, was produced in the spring\r\nof 1675; it was born dead, and five days later it was buried.\r\n\r\nThe hostilities culminated two years later. It is commonly said that\r\nRacine wrote in the conventional and courtly taste of his own day.\r\nIn reality his presentation of tragic passions in their terror and\r\ntheir truth shocked the aristocratic proprieties which were the mode.\r\nHe was an innovator, and his audacity at once conquered and repelled.\r\nIt was known that Racine was engaged on _Phedre_. The Duchesse de\r\nBouillon and her brother the Duc de Nevers were arbiters of elegance\r\nin literature, and decreed that it should fail. A rival play on the\r\nsame subject was ordered from Pradon; and to insure her victory the\r\nDuchess, at a cost of fifteen thousand livres, as Boileau declares,\r\nengaged the front seats of two theatres for six successive\r\nevenings--the one to be packed with applauding spectators, the other\r\nto exhibit empty benches, diversified with creatures who could hiss.\r\nNothing could dignify Pradon's play, as nothing could really degrade\r\nthat of Racine. But Racine was in the highest degree sensitive, and\r\nsuch a desperate plot against his fame might well make him pause and\r\nreflect.\r\n\r\n_Phedre_, like _Iphigenie_, is a new creation from Euripides. Its\r\nsingular beauty has been accurately defined as a mingling of horror\r\nand compassion, of terror and curiosity. It is less a drama than one\r\ngreat part, and that part consists of a diseased state of the soul,\r\na morbid conflict of emotions, so that the play becomes overmuch a\r\nstudy in the pathology of passion. The greatness of the role of the\r\nheroine constitutes the infirmity of the play as a whole; the other\r\ncharacters seem to exist only for the sake of deploying the inward\r\nstruggle of which Phedre is the victim. Love and jealousy rage within\r\nher; remorse follows, for something of Christian sentiment is\r\nconveyed by Racine into his classical fable. Never had his power as\r\na psychologist in art been so wonderfully exhibited; yet he had\r\nelsewhere attained more completely the ideal of the drama. In the\r\nsuccession of his profane masterpieces we may say of the last that\r\nit is lesser than the first and greater. _Phedre_ lacks the balance\r\nand proportion of _Andromaque_; but never had Racine exhibited the\r\ntempest and ravage of passion in a woman's soul on so great a scale\r\nor with force so terrible.\r\n\r\nThe cabal might make him pause; his own play, profoundly moralised\r\nas it was, might cause him to consider. Events of the day, crimes\r\nof passion, adulteries, poisonings, nameless horrors, might agitate\r\nhis spirit. Had he not fed the full-blown passions of the time? What\r\nif Nicole's word that playwrights were public poisoners should be\r\ntrue? Probably various causes operated on the mobile spirit of Racine;\r\ncertainly the Christian, of Jansenist education, who had slumbered\r\nwithin him, now awakened. He resolved to quit the world and adopt\r\nthe Carthusian habit. The advice of his confessor was that he should\r\nregulate his life by marriage. Racine yielded, and found his\r\ncontentment in a wife who was ignorant of his plays, and in children\r\nwhose inclinations and training were religious. The penitent was\r\nhappy in his household, happy also in his reconciliation with Nicole\r\nand Arnauld. To Boileau he remained attached. And he did not renounce\r\nthe court. Was not the King the anointed vicegerent of God, who could\r\nnot be too much honoured? He accepted, with Boileau as fellow-labourer,\r\nthe position of the King's historiographer, and endeavoured to fulfil\r\nits duties.\r\n\r\nTwelve years after his withdrawal from the theatre, Racine, at the\r\nrequest of Madame de Maintenon, composed his Biblical tragedy of\r\n_Esther_ (1688-89) for her cherished schoolgirls at Saint-Cyr. The\r\nsubject was not unaptly chosen--a prudent and devout Esther now helped\r\nto guide the fortunes of France, and she was surrounded at Saint-Cyr\r\nby her chorus of young daughters of Sion. _Esther_ was rendered by\r\nthe pupils, with graceful splendours, before the King, and the delight\r\nwas great. The confidante of the Persian Queen indeed forgot her\r\nwords; at Racine's hasty complaint the young actress wept, and the\r\npoet, weeping with her, wiped away her tears.\r\n\r\n_Esther_ is a melodious play, exquisite in its refined style and\r\ndelicate versification; but the characters are faintly drawn. Its\r\nnovelty lay in its lyrical movements and in the poetical uses of its\r\nfinely-imagined spectacle. Madame de Maintenon or her directors\r\nfeared that the excitement and ambitions of another play in costume\r\nmight derange the spirits of her girls, and when _Athalie_ was recited\r\nat Versailles, in January 1691, it was little of an event; the play\r\npassed almost unnoticed. A noisy reception, indeed, would have been\r\nno fitting tribute to its solemn beauty. All Racine's religious\r\nfeeling, all his domestic tenderness are united in _Athalie_ with\r\nhis matured feeling for Greek art. The great protagonist is the Divine\r\nBeing; Providence replaces the fate of the ancient drama. A child\r\n(for Racine was still an innovator in the French theatre) was the\r\ncentre of the action; the interests were political, or rather national,\r\nin the highest sense; the events were, as formerly, the developments\r\nof inward character; but events and characters were under the\r\npresiding care of God. The tragedy is lyrical, not merely through\r\nthe chorus, which expresses common emotions of devout joy and fear,\r\nindignation, praise, and rapture. The chorus is less developed here,\r\nand its chants are less impressive than in _Esther_. There is, however,\r\na lyrism, personal and modern, in the prophetic inspiration of the\r\nHigh Priest, and Racine anticipated that his boldness in presenting\r\nthis might be censured by his contemporaries. The unity of place,\r\nwhich had been disregarded in _Esther_, is here preserved; the scene\r\nis the temple at Jerusalem; and by its impressive grandeur, and the\r\nawful associations of the place, the spectacle may be said to take\r\npart in the action of the play. Perhaps it would be no exaggeration\r\nto assert that grandeur and beauty are nowhere else so united in French\r\ndramatic art as in _Athalie_; perhaps it might truly be described\r\nas flawless in majesty and grace.\r\n\r\nA light disfavour of the King saddened, and perhaps hastened, the\r\nclose of Racine's life. Port-Royal was regarded as a centre of\r\nrebellious heresy; and Racine's piety to his early masters was humble\r\nand devout. He had further offended by drawing up a memorandum on\r\nthe sufferings of the French people resulting from the wars. Madame\r\nde Maintenon assured him that the cloud would pass; but the favour\r\nof death, accepted with tranquillity, came before the returning\r\nfavour of the poet's master. He died in April 1699, soon after he\r\nhad entered his sixtieth year.\r\n\r\nThe highest distinction of the drama of Racine is its truth to\r\nnature--truth, that is, in its interpretation and rendering of human\r\npassion. Historical accuracy and local colour concerned him as far\r\nas they were needful with his courtly spectators for verisimilitude.\r\nThe fluctuations of passion he studies to most advantage in his\r\ncharacters of women. Love, in all its varieties, from the passion\r\nof Roxane or Phedre to the pure devotion of Berenice, Iphigenie, or\r\nMonime; maternal tenderness or the tenderness of the foster-mother\r\n(Andromaque, Clytemnestre, Josabeth); female ambition (Agrippine,\r\nAthalie)--these are the themes of his exposition. His style has been\r\njustly characterised as a continual creation; its audacity underlies\r\nits suavity; its miracles are accomplished with the simplest means.\r\nHis vocabulary is singularly small, yet with such a vocabulary he\r\ncan attain the rarest effects. From sustained dignity he can pass\r\nsuddenly, when the need arises, to the most direct familiarity. The\r\nmusic of his verse is seldom rich or sonorous; it is at once a pure\r\nvehicle for the idea and a delicate caress to the senses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\nBOSSUET AND THE PREACHERS--FENELON\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\"A man set under authority\"--these words, better than any other,\r\ndefine Bossuet. Above him was God, represented in things spiritual\r\nby the Catholic Church, in things temporal by the French monarchy;\r\nbelow him were the faithful confided to his charge, and those who\r\nwould lead the faithful astray from the path of obedience and\r\ntradition. Duty to what was above him, duty to those placed under\r\nhim, made up the whole of Bossuet's life. To maintain, to defend,\r\nto extend the tradition he had received, was the first of duties.\r\nAll his powers as an orator, a controversialist, an educator were\r\ndirected to this object. He wrote and spoke to dominate the intellects\r\nof men and to subdue their wills, not for the sake of personal power,\r\nbut for the truth as he had received it from the Church and from the\r\nmonarchy.\r\n\r\nJACQUES-BENIGNE BOSSUET was born in 1627, at Dijon, of a middle-class\r\nfamily, distinguished in the magistracy. In his education, pursued\r\nwith resolute ardour, the two traditions of Hellenism and Hebraism\r\nwere fused together: Homer and Virgil were much to him; but the Bible,\r\nabove all, nourished his imagination, his conscience, and his will.\r\nThe celebrity of his scholarship and the flatteries of Parisian\r\n_salons_ did not divert him from his course. At twenty-five he was\r\na priest and a doctor of the Sorbonne. Six years were spent at Metz,\r\na city afflicted by the presence of Protestants and Jews, where\r\nBossuet fortified himself with theological studies, preached,\r\npanegyrised the saints, and confuted heretics. His fame drew him to\r\nParis, where, during ten years, his sermons were among the great\r\nevents of the time. In 1669 he was named Bishop of Condom, but, being\r\nappointed preceptor to the Dauphin, he resigned his bishopric, and\r\ndevoted himself to forming the mind of a pupil, indolent and dull,\r\nwho might one day be the vicegerent of God for his country. Bishop\r\nof Meaux in 1681, he opened the assembly of French clergy next year\r\nwith his memorable sermon on the unity of the Church, and by his\r\nauthority carried, in a form decisive for freedom while respectful\r\ntowards Rome, the four articles which formulated the liberties of\r\nthe Gallican Church. The duties of his diocese, controversy against\r\nProtestantism, the controversy against Quietism, in which Fenelon\r\nwas his antagonist, devotional writings, strictures upon the stage,\r\ncontroversy against the enlightened Biblical criticism of Richard\r\nSimon, filled his energetic elder years. He ceased from a life of\r\nglorious labour and resolute combat in April 1704.\r\n\r\nThe works of Bossuet, setting aside his commentaries on Holy Scripture,\r\ndevotional treatises, and letters, fall into three chief groups: the\r\neloquence of the pulpit, controversial writings, and writings\r\ndesigned for the instruction of the Dauphin.\r\n\r\nPolitical eloquence could not exist where power was grasped by the\r\nhands of one great ruler. Judicial eloquence lacked the breadth and\r\nelevation which come with political freedom; it contented itself with\r\nsubtleties of argument, decked with artificial flowers of style. The\r\npulpit was the school of oratory. St. Vincent de Paul had preached\r\nwith unction and a grave simplicity, and Bossuet, his disciple, felt\r\nhis influence. But the offering which Bossuet laid upon the altar\r\nmust needs be costly, an offering of all his powers. While an\r\nunalterable good sense regulates all he wrote, the sweep of his\r\nintellect demanded plenitude of expression; his imagination, if it\r\ndealt with life and death, must needs deal with them at times in the\r\nway of magnificence, which was natural to it; and his lyrical\r\nenthusiasm, fed by the prophetic poetry of the Old Testament, could\r\nnot but find an escape in words. He sought no literary fame; his\r\nsermons were acts of faith, acts of duty. Out of the vast mass of\r\nhis discourses he printed one, a sermon of public importance--that\r\non the unity of the Church.\r\n\r\nAt the request of friends, some of the Funeral Orations were published.\r\nThese, with his address on the profession of Louise de La Valliere,\r\nwere all that could be read of Bossuet's pulpit oratory by his\r\ncontemporaries. His sermons were carefully meditated and prepared,\r\nbut he would not check his power of lofty improvisation by following\r\nthe words of a manuscript. After his death his papers had perilous\r\nadventures. By the devotion of his first editor, Deforis, nearly two\r\nhundred sermons were after many years recovered; later students have\r\npresented them with as close an approximation as is possible to their\r\noriginal form. Bossuet's first manner--that of the years at Metz--is\r\nsometimes marred by scholastic subtleties, a pomp of quotations, too\r\ncurious imagery, and a temper rather aggressive than conciliating.\r\nDuring the period when he preached in Paris he was master of all his\r\npowers, which move with freedom and at the same time with a majestic\r\norder; his grandeur grows out of simplicity. As Bishop of Meaux he\r\nexhorted his flock out of the abundance of his heart, often without\r\nthe intermediary of written preparation.\r\n\r\nHe is primarily a doctor of the faith: dogma first, determined by\r\nauthority, and commending itself to human reason; morality, not\r\nindependent, but proceeding from or connected with dogma, and while\r\ntruly human yet resting upon divine foundations. But neither dogma\r\nnor morals are presented in the manner of the schools; both are made\r\nliving powers by the preacher's awe, adoration, joy, charity,\r\nindignation, pity; in the large ordonnance of his discourse each\r\npassion finds its natural place. His eloquence grows out of his theme;\r\nhis logic is the logic of clear and natural ideas; he is lucid, rapid,\r\nenergetic; then suddenly some aspect of his subject awakens a lyrical\r\nemotion, and the preacher rises into the prophet.\r\n\r\nBossuet's panegyrics of the saints are sermons in which doctrine and\r\nmorals are enforced by great examples. His _Oraisons Funebres_ preach,\r\nfor the uses of the living, the doctrine of death. Nowhere else does\r\nhe so fill the mind with a sense of the greatness and the glory of\r\nlife as when he stands beside the bier and reviews the achievements\r\nor presents the characters of the illustrious deceased. Observing\r\nas he did all the decorum of the occasion, his discourses do not\r\ndegenerate into mere adulation; some are historic surveys,\r\nmagnificent in their breadth of view and mastery of events. He\r\npresents things as he saw them, and he did not always see aright.\r\nCromwell is a hypocrite and an impostor; the revocation of the edict\r\nof Nantes is the laudable act of a king who is a defender of the faith.\r\nThe intolerance of Bossuet proceeds not so much from his heart as\r\nfrom the logic of his orthodoxy. His heart had a tenderness which\r\nbreaks forth in many places, and signally in the discourse occasioned\r\nby the death of the Duchess of Orleans. This, and the eloquent\r\nmemorials of her mother, Henrietta, Queen of England, and of the\r\nPrince de Conde, touch the heights and depths of the passions proper\r\nto the grave.\r\n\r\nBossuet's polemic against Protestantism is sufficiently represented\r\nby his _Exposition de la Doctrine Catholique_ (published 1671) and\r\nthe _Histoire des Variations des Eglises Protestantes_ (1688). The\r\nlatter, in its fifteen books, is an attempt to overwhelm the\r\ncontending Protestant communions by one irresistible attack. Their\r\ndiversities of error are contrasted with the one, unchanging faith\r\nof the infallible Church. Lutherans, Calvinists, Anglicans, the\r\nAlbigenses, the Hussites, the Wicliffites are routed and slain, as\r\nopponents are slain in theological warfare--to rise again. History\r\nand theology co-operate in the result. The characters of the\r\nProtestant Reformers are studied with a remorseless scrutiny, and\r\nan art which can bring into relief what the work of art requires.\r\nWhy the children of the infallible Church rose up in disobedience\r\nagainst their mother is left unexplained. The great heresy, Bossuet\r\nwas persuaded, had almost reached its term; the intellectual chaos\r\nwould soon be restored to universal order under the successors of\r\nInnocent XI.\r\n\r\nIn the embittered controversy with his brother-Bishop of Cambrai,\r\non the significance of which the singular autobiography of Madame\r\nGuyon[1] throws much light, Bossuet remained the victor. It was a\r\ncontention between dogmatic rectitude and the temper of emotional\r\nreligion. Bossuet was at first unversed in the writings of the\r\nCatholic mystics. Being himself a fully-formed will, watchful and\r\narmed for obedience and command--the \"man under authority\"--he\r\nrightly divined the dangers to dogmatic faith arising from\r\nself-abandonment to God within the heart. The elaborate structure\r\nof orthodoxy seemed to dissolve in the ardour of a personal emotion;\r\nit seemed to him another form of the individualism which he condemned.\r\nThe Church was a great objective reality; it had laid down a system\r\nof belief. A love of God which ignored the method of God, was but\r\na spurious love, leading to destruction.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Translated into English for the first time in full, 1897,\r\nby T. T. Allen.]\r\n\r\nProtestant self-will, mystical private emotion--these were in turn\r\nmet by the champion of tradition, and, as he trusted, were subdued.\r\nAnother danger he perceived, not in the unregenerate will or wandering\r\nheart, but in the critical intelligence. Bossuet again was right in\r\nviewing with alarm the Biblical studies of Richard Simon. But his\r\nscholarship was here defective. He succeeded in suppressing an\r\nedition of the _Histoire Critique du Vieux Testament_. There were\r\nprinters in Holland beyond the reach of Bossuet's arm; and Simon\r\ncontinued the work which others have carried further with the aids\r\nof more exact science.\r\n\r\nTo doubt the government of His world by the Divine Ruler, who assigns\r\nus our duty and our place, is to sap the principles of authority and\r\nof obedience. The doctrine of God's providence is at the centre of\r\nall Bossuet's system of thought, at the heart of his loyal passions.\r\nOn earth, the powers that be; in France, the monarch; in heaven, a\r\ngreater Monarch (we will not say a magnified Louis XIV.) presiding\r\nover all the affairs of this globe. When Bossuet tried to educate\r\nhis indocile pupil the Dauphin, he taught him how God is above man,\r\nas man is above the brute. Monarchy--as he showed in his _Politique\r\nTiree de l'Ecriture Sainte_--is hereditary and absolute; but\r\nabsolute power is not arbitrary power; the King is God's subject,\r\nand his laws must conform to those of his Divine Ruler. The _Discours\r\nsur l'Histoire Universelle_ (1681) was written in the first instance\r\nfor the Dauphin; but its purpose was partly apologetic, and Bossuet,\r\nespecially in the second part of the book, had the errors of\r\nfree-thinkers--Spinoza and Simon--before his mind.\r\n\r\nThe seventeenth century had not contributed largely to historical\r\nliterature, save in the form of memoirs. Mezeray, in the first half\r\nof the century, Fleury, in the second, cannot be ranked among those\r\nwriters who illuminate with profound and just ideas. The Cartesian\r\nphilosophy viewed historical studies with haughty indifference.\r\nBossuet's _Discours_ is a vindication of the ways of God in history,\r\na theology of human progress. He would exhibit the nations and\r\ngenerations of human-kind bound each to each under the Providential\r\ngovernment. The life of humanity, from Adam to Charlemagne, is mapped\r\ninto epochs, ages, periods--the periods of nature, of the law, and\r\nof grace. In religion is found the unity of human history. By religion\r\nis meant Judaism and Christianity; by Christianity is meant the\r\nCatholicism of Rome.\r\n\r\nHaving expounded the Divine policy in the government of the world,\r\nBossuet is free to study those secondary causes which have determined\r\nthe rise and fall of empires. With magisterial authority, and with\r\nmajestic skill, he presents the movements of races and peoples. His\r\nsympathy with the genius of ancient Rome proceeds not only from his\r\ncomprehensive grasp of facts, but from a kinship between his own and\r\nthe Roman type of character. The magnificent design of Bossuet was\r\nmagnificently accomplished. He hoped to extend his studies, and apply\r\nhis method to other parts of his vast subject, but the hope was not\r\nto be fulfilled. A disinterested student of the philosophy of history\r\nhe is not; he is the theologian who marshals facts under an accepted\r\ndogma. A conception of Providence may indeed emerge from the\r\nresearches of a devout investigator of the life of humanity as their\r\nlast result; but towards that conception the secular life and the\r\nvarious religions of the world will contribute; the ways of the Divine\r\nSpirit will appear other than those of the anthropomorphic Ruler of\r\nBossuet's imagination. He was not an original thinker; he would have\r\nscorned such a distinction--\"l'heretique est celui qui a une\r\nopinion\"; he had received the truth, and only gave it extended\r\napplications. He is \"le sublime orateur des idees communes.\"\r\n\r\nMore than an orator, before all else he was a combatant. Falling at\r\nhis post as the eighteenth century opened, he is like some majestic,\r\nwhite-haired paladin of old romances which tell of the strife between\r\nFrench chivalry and the Saracenic hordes. Bossuet fell; the age of\r\ngrowing incredulity and novel faiths was inaugurated; the infidels\r\npassed over the body of the champion of conservative tradition.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nBossuet's contemporaries esteemed him as a preacher less highly than\r\nthey esteemed the Jesuit Bourdaloue. The life of LOUIS BOURDALOUE\r\n(1632-1704) is told in the words of Vinet: \"He preached, confessed,\r\nconsoled, and then he died.\" It does credit to his hearers that they\r\nvalued him aright--a modest man of simple probity. He spoke, with\r\ndowncast eyes and full harmonious voice, as a soul to souls; his\r\neloquence was not that of the rhetorician; his words were grave and\r\nplain and living, and were pressed home with the force of their reality.\r\nHe aimed never at display, but always at conviction. When the crowd\r\nat St. Sulpice was moved as he entered the church and ascended the\r\npulpit, \"Silence!\" cried the Prince de Conde, \"there is our enemy!\"\r\nBourdaloue marshalled his arguments and expositions with the\r\nelaborate skill of a tactician; he sought to capture the judgment;\r\nhe reached the heart through a wise director's knowledge of its inmost\r\nprocesses. When his words were touched with emotion, it was the\r\ninvoluntary manifestation of the life within him. His studies of\r\ncharacter sometimes tended to the form of portraits of moral types,\r\nfeatures in which could be identified with actual persons; but in\r\nthese he was the moralist, not the satirist. During four-and-thirty\r\nyears Bourdaloue distributed, to those who would take it, the bread\r\nof life--plain, wholesome, prepared skilfully and with clean hands,\r\nnever varying from the evenness and excellence of its quality. He\r\ndoes not startle or dazzle a reader; he does what is better--he\r\nnourishes.\r\n\r\nBourdaloue pronounced only two _Oraisons Funebres_, and those under\r\nthe constraint of duty. He thought the Christian pulpit was meant\r\nfor less worldly uses than the eulogy of mortal men. The _Oraison\r\nFunebre_ was more to the taste of Mascaron (1634-1703), whose unequal\r\nrhetoric was at its best in his panegyric of Turenne; more to the\r\ntaste of the elegant FLECHIER, Bishop of Nimes. All the literary\r\ngraces were cultivated by Flechier (1632-1710), and his eloquence\r\nis unquestionable; but it was not the eloquence proper to the pulpit.\r\nHe was a man of letters, a man of the world, formed in the school\r\nof preciosity, a haunter of the Hotel de Rambouillet; knowing the\r\nsurface of society, he knew as a moralist how to depict its manners\r\nand the evil that lay in them. He did not apply doctrine to life like\r\nBossuet, nor search the heart with Bourdaloue's serious zeal; to save\r\nsouls was indeed important; to exhibit his talents before the King\r\nwas also important. But the true eloquence of the pulpit has deeper\r\nsprings than lay in Flechier's mundane spirit. Already the decadence\r\nhas begun.\r\n\r\nProtestantism had its preacher in JACQUES SAURIN (1677-1730), clear,\r\nlogical, energetic, with negligences of style and sudden flashes of\r\ngenius. But he belongs to London, to Geneva, to the Hague more perhaps\r\nthan to France. An autumnal colouring, bright and abundant, yet\r\nindicative of the decline, is displayed in the discourses of the\r\nlatest of the great pulpit orators, JEAN-BAPTISTE MASSILLON\r\n(1663-1742), who belongs more to the eighteenth than to the\r\nseventeenth century. \"He must increase,\" said Bourdaloue, \"but I must\r\ndecrease.\" Massillon, with gifts of person and of natural grace,\r\nsensitive, tender, a student and professor of the rhetorical art,\r\nsincerely devout, yet with waverings towards the world, had something\r\nin his genius that resembled Racine. A pathetic sentiment, a feeling\r\nfor human passions, give his sermons qualities which contrast with\r\nthe severer manner of Bourdaloue. They are simple in plan; the\r\npreacher's art lay in deploying and developing a few ideas, and\r\ninfusing into them an imaginative sensibility; he is facile and\r\nabundant; faultless in amenity, but deficient in force and fire. Yet\r\nthe opening words of the Funeral Oration on Louis XIV.--\"God alone\r\nis great, my brethren\"--are noble in their simplicity; and the thought\r\nof Jesus suddenly appearing in \"the most august assembly of the\r\nworld\"--in the chapel at Versailles--startled the hearers of the\r\nsermon on the \"small number of the elect.\" \"There is an orator!\" cried\r\nthe actor Baron, \"we are only comedians;\" but no actor would have\r\ninstituted a comparison between himself and Bourdaloue. \"When one\r\nenters the avenue at Versailles,\" said Massillon, \"one feels an\r\nenervating air.\"\r\n\r\nHe was aware of the rising tide of luxury and vice around him; he\r\ntried to meet it, tracing the scepticism of the time to its\r\nill-regulated passions; but he met scepticism by morality detached\r\nfrom dogma. The _Petit Careme_, preached before Louis XV. when a child\r\nof eight, expresses the sanguine temper of the moment: the young King\r\nwould grow into the father of his people; the days of peace would\r\nreturn. Great and beneficent kings are not effeminately amiable; it\r\nwere better if Massillon had preached \"Be strong\" than \"Be tender.\"\r\nVoltaire kept on his desk the sermons of Massillon, and loved to hear\r\nthe musical periods of the _Petit Careme_ read aloud at meal-time.\r\nTo be the favourite preacher of eighteenth-century philosophers is\r\na distinction somewhat compromising to an exponent of the faith.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nBossuet's great antagonist in the controversy concerning Quietism\r\nmight have found the approval of the philosophers for some of his\r\npolitical opinions. His religious writings would have spoken to them\r\nin an unknown tongue.\r\n\r\nFRANCOIS DE SALIGNAC DE LA MOTHE-FENELON was born in Perigord (1651),\r\nof an ancient and illustrious family. Of one whose intellect and\r\ncharacter were infinitely subtle and complex, the blending of all\r\nopposites, it is possible to sustain the most conflicting opinions,\r\nand perhaps in the end no critic can seize this Proteus. Saint-Simon\r\nnoticed how in his noble countenance every contrary quality was\r\nexpressed, and how all were harmonised: \"Il fallait faire effort pour\r\ncesser de le regarder.\" During the early years of his clerical career\r\nhe acted as superior to female converts from Protestantism, and as\r\nmissionary among the unconverted Calvinists. In 1689 he was appointed\r\ntutor to the King's grandson, the Duc de Bourgogne, and from a\r\npassionate boy he transformed his pupil into a youth too blindly\r\ndocile. Fenelon's nomination to the Archbishopric of Cambrai (1695),\r\nwhich removed him from the court, was in fact a check to his ambition.\r\nHis religious and his political views were regarded by Louis XIV.\r\nas dangerous for the Church and the monarchy.\r\n\r\nThrough his personal interest in Mme. Guyon, and his sympathy with\r\nher mystical doctrine in religion--one which inculcated complete\r\nabnegation of the will, and its replacement by absolute surrender\r\nto the Divine love--he came into conflict with Bossuet, and after\r\na fierce war of diplomacy and of pamphlets, in which Fenelon displayed\r\nthe utmost skill and energy as tactician and dialectician, he received\r\na temperate condemnation from Rome, and submitted. The death of the\r\nDauphin (1711), which left his former pupil heir to the throne,\r\nrevived Fenelon's hopes of political influence, but in the next year\r\nthese hopes disappeared with the decease of the young Duc de Bourgogne.\r\nAt Cambrai, where he discharged his episcopal duties like a saint\r\nand a _grand seigneur_, Fenelon died six months before Louis XIV.,\r\nin 1715.\r\n\r\n\"The most original intellect--if we set Pascal aside--of the\r\nseventeenth century\"--so Fenelon is described by one excellent\r\ncritic. \"Antique and modern,\" writes his biographer, M. Paul Janet,\r\n\"Christian and profane, mystical and diplomatic, familiar and noble,\r\ngentle and headstrong, natural and subtle, fascinating the\r\neighteenth century as he had fascinated the seventeenth, believing\r\nlike a child, and daring as Spinoza, Fenelon is one of the most\r\noriginal figures which the Catholic Church has produced.\" His first\r\npublication was the treatise _De l'Education des Filles_ (written\r\n1681, published 1687), composed at the request of his friends the\r\nDuc and Duchesse de Beauvilliers. It is based on a recognition of\r\nthe dignity of woman and the duty of a serious effort to form her\r\nmind. It honours the reason, opposes severity, would make instruction,\r\nas far as possible, a delight, and would exhibit goodness in a gracious\r\naspect; commends object-lessons in addition to book-learning,\r\nindicates characteristic feminine failings (yet liveliness of\r\ndisposition is not regarded as one of these), exhorts to a dignified\r\nsimplicity in dress. The range of studies recommended is narrow, but\r\nfor Fenelon's time it was liberal; the book marks an epoch in the\r\nhistory of female education.\r\n\r\nFor his pupil the Duc de Bourgogne, Fenelon wrote his graceful prose\r\n_Fables_ (which also include under that title short tales, allegories,\r\nand fairy stories), the _Dialogues des Morts_, aiming at the\r\napplication of moral principles to politics, and his _Telemaque_,\r\nnamed in the first (incomplete) edition _Suite du IVe Livre de\r\nl'Odyssee_ (1699). In this, for long the most popular of tales for\r\nthe young, Fenelon's imaginative devotion to antiquity finds ample\r\nexpression; it narrates the wanderings of Telemachus in search of\r\nhis father Ulysses, under the warning guidance and guardianship of\r\nMinerva disguised as Mentor. Imitations and borrowings from\r\nclassical authors are freely and skilfully made. It is a poem in prose,\r\na romance of education, designed at once to charm the imagination\r\nand to inculcate truths of morals, politics, and religion. The\r\ndidactic purpose is evident, yet it remains a true work of art, full\r\nof grace and colour, occasionally, indeed, languid, but often vivid\r\nand forcible.\r\n\r\nFenelon's views on politics were not so much fantastic as those of\r\nan idealist. He dreamed of a monarchy which should submit to the\r\ncontrol of righteousness; he mourned over the pride and extravagance\r\nof the court; he constantly pleaded against wars of ambition; he\r\ndesired that a powerful and Christian nobility should mediate between\r\nthe crown and the people; he conceived a system of decentralisation\r\nwhich should give the whole nation an interest in public affairs;\r\nin his ecclesiastical views he was Ultramontane rather than Gallican.\r\nThese ideas are put forth in his _Direction pour la Conscience d'un\r\nRoi_ and the _Plan de Gouvernement_. Louis XIV. suspected the\r\npolitical tendency of _Telemaque_, and caused the printing of the\r\nfirst edition to be suspended. Fenelon has sometimes been regarded\r\nas a forerunner of the Revolutionary movement; but he would rather,\r\nby ideas in which, as events proved, there may have been something\r\nchimerical, have rendered revolution impossible.\r\n\r\nInto his controversy with Bossuet he threw himself with a combative\r\nenergy and a skill in defence and attack that surprise one who knows\r\nhim only through his _Lettres Spirituelles_, which tend towards the\r\neffacement of the will in a union with God through love. Bossuet\r\npleaded against the dangers for morals and for theology of a false\r\nmysticism; Fenelon, against confounding true mysticism with what is\r\nfalse. In his _Traite de l'Existence de Dieu_ he shows himself a bold\r\nand subtle thinker: the first part, which is of a popular character,\r\nattempts to prove the existence of the Deity by the argument from\r\ndesign in nature and from the reason in man; the second part--of a\r\nlater date--follows Descartes in metaphysical proofs derived from\r\nour idea of an infinite and a perfect being. To his other distinctions\r\nFenelon added that of a literary critic, unsurpassed in his time,\r\nunless it be by Boileau. His _Dialogues sur l'Eloquence_ seek to\r\nreplace the elaborate methods of logical address, crowded with\r\ndivisions and subdivisions, and supported with a multitude of\r\nquotations, by a style simple, natural, and delicate in its fervency.\r\n\r\nThe admirable _Lettre a l'Academie_, Fenelon's latest gift to\r\nliterature, states the case of the ancients against the moderns, and\r\nof the moderns against the ancients, with an attempt at impartiality,\r\nbut it is evident that the writer's love was chiefly given to his\r\nfavourite classical authors; simplicity and natural beauty attracted\r\nhim more than ingenuity or wit or laboured brilliance. He feared that\r\nthe language was losing some of its richness and flexibility; he\r\ncondemns the use of rhyme; he is hardly just to Racine, but honours\r\nhimself by his admiration of Moliere. In dealing with historical\r\nwritings he recognises the importance of the study of governments,\r\ninstitutions, and social life, and at the same time values highly\r\na personal, vivid, direct manner, and a feeling for all that is real,\r\nconcrete, and living. To his rare gifts of intellect and of the soul\r\nwas added an inexpressible personal charm, in which something that\r\nwas almost feminine was united with the reserved power and authority\r\nof a man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\nTRANSITION TO THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spiritual life was interpreted from within by Fenelon. The facts\r\nof the moral world, as seen in society, were studied, analysed, and\r\nportrayed by La Bruyere and Saint-Simon.\r\n\r\nJEAN DE LA BRUYERE (1645-96), a Parisian of the _bourgeoisie_,\r\nappointed preceptor in history to the grandson of the great Conde,\r\nsaw with the keen eyes of a disenchanted observer the spectacle of\r\nseventeenth-century society. In 1688, appended to his translation\r\nof the Characters of Theophrastus, appeared his only important work,\r\n_Les Caracteres ou les Moeurs de ce Siecle_; revised and enlarged\r\neditions followed, until the ninth was published in 1696. \"I restore\r\nto the public,\" he wrote, \"what the public lent me.\" In a series of\r\nsixteen chapters, each consisting of detached paragraphs, his\r\nstudies of human life and of the social environment are presented\r\nin the form of maxims, reflections, observations, portraits. For the\r\nmaxims a recent model lay before him in the little volume of La\r\nRochefoucauld; portraits, for which the romances of Mlle. de Scudery\r\nhad created a taste, had been exhibited in a collection formed by\r\nMlle. de Montpensier--the growth of her _salon_--in collaboration\r\nwith Segrais (_Divers Portraits_, 1659). Aware of his mastery as a\r\npainter of character, La Bruyere added largely to the number of his\r\nportraits in the later editions. Keys, professing to identify his\r\ncharacter-sketches with living persons, enhanced the interest\r\nexcited by the work; but in many instances La Bruyere aims at\r\npresenting a type rather than an individual, a type which had been\r\nindividualised by his observation of actual persons.\r\n\r\nA profound or an original thinker he was not. Incapable of employing\r\nbase means to attain worldly success, his honourable failure left\r\na certain bitterness in his spirit; he regarded the life around him\r\nas a looker-on, who enjoyed the spectacle, and enjoyed also to note\r\nthe infirmities of those who took part in the game which he had\r\ndeclined. He is neither a determined pessimist, nor did he see\r\nrealities through a roseate veil; he neither thinks basely of human\r\nnature nor in a heroic fashion: he studies its weakness with a view,\r\nhe declares, to reformation, but actually, perhaps, more in the way\r\nof an observer than of a moral teacher. He is before all else a\r\n\"naturalist,\" a naturalist with a sufficient field for investigation,\r\nthough the life of the provinces and that of the fields (save in their\r\nmore obvious aspect of mournful toil) lie beyond his sphere. The value\r\nof his criticisms of men and manners arises partly from the fact that\r\nhe is not pledged to a system, that he can take up various points\r\nof view, and express the results of many moods of mind. Now he is\r\nsevere, and again he is indulgent; now he appears almost a cynic,\r\nand presently we find that his heart is tender; now he is grave, and\r\nin a moment mirthful; while for every purpose and in every mood he\r\nhas irony at his command. He divines the working of the passions with\r\na fine intelligence, and is a master in noting every outward betrayal\r\nor indication of the hidden processes of the heart.\r\n\r\nThe successive chapters deal with the intellect and authorship,\r\npersonal merit, women, the heart, society and conversation, the gifts\r\nof fortune, the town, the court, men in high station, the King and\r\ncommonwealth, the nature of man, judgments and criticism, fashion,\r\ncustoms, the pulpit; and under each head are grouped, without formal\r\nsystem, those notes on life and studies of society that had gradually\r\naccumulated in the author's mind. A final chapter, \"Des Esprits\r\nForts,\" expresses a vague spiritual philosophy, which probably was\r\nnot insincere, and which at least served to commend the mundane\r\nportion of his book to pious readers. The special attraction of the\r\nwhole lies in its variety. A volume merely of maxims would have been\r\ntoo rigid, too oracular for such a versatile spirit as that of La\r\nBruyere. \"Different things,\" he says, \"are thought out by different\r\nmethods, and explained by diverse expressions, it may be by a sentence,\r\nan argument, a metaphor or some other figure, a parallel, a simple\r\ncomparison, a complete fact, a single feature, by description, or\r\nby portraiture.\" His book contains all these, and his style\r\ncorresponds with the variety of matter and method--a style, as\r\nVoltaire justly characterises it, rapid, concise, nervous,\r\npicturesque. \"Among all the different modes in which a single thought\r\nmay be expressed,\" wrote La Bruyere, \"only one is correct.\" To find\r\nthis exact expression he sometimes over-labours his style, and\r\nsearches the vocabulary too curiously for the most striking word.\r\nIn his desire for animation the periodic structure of sentence yields\r\nto one of interruptions, suspensions, and surprises. He is at once\r\na moralist and a virtuoso in the literary art.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of Saint-Simon's life and the composition of his\r\n_Memoires_ belong to the eighteenth century; but his mind was moulded\r\nduring his early years, and retained its form and lineaments. He may\r\nbe regarded as a belated representative of the great age of Louis\r\nXIV. If he belongs in some degree to the newer age by virtue of his\r\nsense that political reform was needed, his designs of political\r\nreform were derived from the past rather than pointed towards the\r\nfuture. LOUIS DE ROUVRAY, DUC DE SAINT-SIMON, was born at Versailles\r\nin 1675. He cherished the belief that his ancestry could be traced\r\nto Charlemagne. His father, a page of Louis XIII., had been named\r\na duke and peer of France in 1635; from his father descended to the\r\nson a devotion to the memory of Louis XIII., and a passionate\r\nattachment to the dignity of his own order.\r\n\r\nSaint-Simon's education was narrow, but he acquired some Latin, and\r\nwas a diligent reader of French history. In 1691 he was presented\r\nto the King and was enrolled as a soldier in the musketeers. He\r\npurchased by-and-by what we should now call the colonelcy of a cavalry\r\nregiment, but was ill-pleased with the system which had transformed\r\na feudal army into one where birth and rank were subjected to official\r\ncontrol; and in 1702, when others received promotion and he was passed\r\nover, he sent in his resignation. Having made a fortunate and happy\r\nmarriage, Saint-Simon was almost constantly at Versailles until the\r\ndeath of the King, and obtained the most intimate acquaintance with\r\nwhat he terms the mechanics of the court. He had many grievances\r\nagainst Louis XIV., chief among them the insult shown to the nobility\r\nin the King's legitimatising his natural offspring; and he justly\r\nregarded Madame de Maintenon as his enemy.\r\n\r\nThe death of the Duc de Bourgogne, to whose party he belonged, was\r\na blow to Saint-Simon's hopes; but the Regent remained his friend.\r\nHe helped, on a diplomatic mission to Spain, to negotiate the marriage\r\nof Louis XV.; yet still was on fire with indignation caused by the\r\nwrongs of the dukes and peers, whom he regarded as entitled on\r\nhistorical grounds to form the great council of the monarchy, and\r\nalmost as rightful partners in the supreme power. His political life\r\nclosed in 1723 with the death of the Regent. He lived in retirement\r\nat his chateau of La Ferte-Vidame, sorrowfully surviving his wife\r\nand his sons. In Paris, at the age of eighty (1755), Saint-Simon died.\r\n\r\nWhen nineteen years old, reading Bassompierre's _Memoires_ in a\r\nsoldier's hour of leisure, he conceived the idea of recording his\r\nown experiences, and the _Memoires_ of Saint-Simon were begun. During\r\nlater years, in the camp or at the court, notes accumulated in his\r\nhands, but the definitive form which they took was not determined\r\nuntil, in his retirement at La Ferte-Vidame, the _Journal_ of Dangeau\r\ncame into his hands. Dangeau's _Journal_ is dry, colourless,\r\npassionless, without insight and without art; but it is a\r\nwell-informed and an exact chronicle, extending over the years from\r\n1684 to 1720. Saint-Simon found it \"d'une fadeur a faire vomir\"; its\r\nservility towards the King and Madame de Maintenon enraged him; but\r\nit exhibited facts in an orderly sequence; it might serve as a guide\r\nand a clue among his own reminiscences; on the basis of Dangeau's\r\nliteral transcript of occurrences he might weave his own brilliant\r\nrecitals and passionate presentations of character. Thus\r\nSaint-Simon's _Memoires_ came to be written.\r\n\r\nHe himself saw much, and his eye had a demonic power of observation;\r\nnothing escaped his vision, and his passions enabled him to penetrate\r\nthrough what he saw to its secret meanings. He had gathered\r\ninformation from those who knew the mysteries of the palace and the\r\ncourt; great persons, court ladies, even valets and waiting-women,\r\nhad been sought and searched to satisfy his insatiable curiosity.\r\nIt is true that the passions which often lit up the truth sometimes\r\nobscured it; any gossip discreditable to those whom he hated was\r\nwelcome to him; he confesses that he did not pique himself on his\r\nimpartiality, and it is certain that he did not always verify details.\r\nNevertheless he did not consciously falsify facts; he had a sense\r\nof the honour of a gentleman; his spirit was serious, and his feeling\r\nof duty and of religion was sincere. Without his impetuosity, his\r\nviolence, his exaggerations, we might not have had his vividness,\r\nlike that of life itself, his incomparable portraits, more often\r\ninspired by hatred than by love, his minuteness and his breadth of\r\nstyle, the phrases which ineffaceably brand his victims, the lyrical\r\noutcry of triumph over enemies of his order. His style is the large\r\nstyle of seventeenth-century prose, but alive with words that sparkle\r\nand gleam, words sometimes created by himself to express the intensity\r\nof his imagination.\r\n\r\nThe _Memoires_, the final preparation of which was the work of his\r\nelder years, cover the period from 1691 to 1723. His manuscripts were\r\nbequeathed to his cousin, the Bishop of Metz; a lawsuit arose with\r\nSaint-Simon's creditors, and in the end the papers were buried among\r\nthe public archives. Considerable fragments saw the light before the\r\nclose of the eighteenth century, but it was not until 1829-31 that\r\na true _editio princeps_, substantially correct, was published. The\r\nviolences and irregularities of Saint-Simon's style offered no\r\nobstacle to the admiration of readers at a time when the romantic\r\nmovement was dominant. He was hailed as the Tacitus of French history,\r\nand had his manner something more of habitual concentration the\r\ncomparison would not be unjust.\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth century may be said to have begun before the year 1701\r\nwith the quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns. If we can speak\r\nof any one idea as dominant during the age of the philosophers, it\r\nis the idea of human progress. Through an academic disputation that\r\nidea emerged to the light. At first a religious question was\r\ncomplicated with a question relating to art; afterwards the religious\r\nquestion was replaced by one of philosophy. As early as 1657,\r\nDesmarets de Saint-Sorlin, turned pietist after a youth of licence,\r\nmaintained in theory, as well as by the examples of his unreadable\r\nepic poems, that Christian heroism and Christian faith afforded\r\nmaterial for imaginative handling more suitable to a Christian poet\r\nthan the history and fables of antiquity. Boileau, in the third\r\n_chant_ of his _Art Poetique_, replied--the mysteries of the\r\nChristian faith are too solemn, too awful, to be tricked out to gratify\r\nthe fancy.\r\n\r\nDesmarets dying, bequeathed his contention to CHARLES PERRAULT\r\n(1628-1703), who had burlesqued the _AEneid_, written light and\r\nfragile pieces of verse, and occupied himself as a dilettante in\r\npatristic and historical studies. In 1687, after various skirmishes\r\nbetween partisans on either side, the quarrel assumed a new importance.\r\nThe King had recovered after a painful operation; it was a moment\r\nfor gratulation. Perrault, at a sitting of the Academy, read his poem\r\n_Le Siecle de Louis le Grand_, in which the revolt against the\r\nclassical tyranny was formulated, and contemporary authors were\r\nglorified at the expense of the poets of antiquity. Boileau murmured,\r\nindignant; Racine offered ironical commendations; other\r\nAcademicians patriotically applauded their own praises.\r\nLight-feathered epigrams sped to and fro.\r\n\r\nFontenelle, in his _Discours sur l'Eglogue_ and a _Digression sur\r\nles Anciens et les Modernes_, widened the field of debate. Were trees\r\nin ancient days taller than those in our own fields? If not, why may\r\nnot modern men equal Homer, Plato, and Demosthenes? \"Nothing checks\r\nthe progress of things, nothing confines the intelligence so much\r\nas admiration of the ancients.\" Genius is bestowed by Nature on every\r\nage, but knowledge grows from generation to generation. In his\r\ndialogues entitled the _Parallele des Anciens et des Modernes_\r\n(1688-97), Perrault maintained that in art, in science, in literature,\r\nthe law of the human mind is a law of progress; that we are the true\r\nancients of the earth, wise with inherited science, more exact in\r\nreasoning, more refined in psychological distinctions, raised to a\r\nhigher plane by Christianity, by the invention of printing, and by\r\nthe favour of a great monarch. La Fontaine in his charming _Epitre_\r\nto Huet, La Bruyere in his _Caracteres_, Boileau in his ill-tempered\r\n_Reflexions sur Longin_, rallied the supporters of classicism.\r\nGradually the fires smouldered or were assuaged; Boileau and Perrault\r\nwere reconciled.\r\n\r\nPerrault, if he did not honour antiquity in classical forms, paid\r\na homage to popular tradition in his delightful _Contes de ma Mere\r\nl'Oie_ (if, indeed, the tales be his), which have been a joy to\r\ngenerations of children. With inferior art, Madame d'Aulnoy added\r\nto the golden treasury for the young. When, fifteen or twenty years\r\nafter the earlier war, a new campaign began between the Ancients and\r\nthe Moderns, the philosophical discussion of the idea of progress\r\nhad separated itself from the literary quarrel. But in the tiltings\r\nof Lamotte-Houdart, the champion of the moderns, against a\r\nwell-equipped female knight, the learned Madame Dacier--indignant\r\nat Lamotte's _Iliade_, recast in the eighteenth-century taste--a new\r\nquestion was raised, and one of significance for the eighteenth\r\ncentury--that of the relative merits of prose and verse.\r\n\r\nLamotte, a writer of comedy, tragedy, opera, fables, eclogues, odes,\r\nmaintained that the highest literary form is prose, and he versified\r\nnone the less. The age was indeed an age of prose--an age when the\r\n_salons_ discussed the latest discovery in science, the latest\r\ndoctrine in philosophy or politics. Its imaginative enthusiasm\r\npassed over from art to speculation, and what may be called the poetry\r\nof the eighteenth century is to be found less in its odes or dramas\r\nor elegies than in the hopes and visions which gathered about that\r\nidea of human progress emerging from a literary discussion, idle,\r\nperhaps, in appearance, but in its inner significance no unfitting\r\ninauguration of an era which looked to the future rather than to the\r\npast.\r\n\r\nBERNARD LE BOVIER DE FONTENELLE (1657-1757), a son of Corneille's\r\nsister, whose intervention in the quarrel of Ancients and Moderns\r\nturned the discussion in the direction of philosophy, belongs to both\r\nthe seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries. In the hundred years\r\nwhich made up his life, there was indeed time for a second Fontenelle\r\nto develop from the first. The first Fontenelle, satirised as the\r\nCydias of La Bruyere, \"un compose du pedant et du precieux,\" was an\r\naspirant poet, without vision, without passion, who tried to\r\ncompensate his deficiencies by artificial elegances of style. The\r\norigin of hissing is maliciously dated by Racine from his tragedy\r\n_Aspar_. His operas fluttered before they fell; his _Eglogues_ had\r\nnot life enough to flutter. The _Dialogues des Morts_ (1683) is a\r\nyoung writer's effort to be clever by paradox, an effort to show his\r\nwit by incongruous juxtapositions, and a cynical levelling of great\r\nreputations. But there was another Fontenelle, the untrammelled\r\ndisciple of Descartes, a man of universal interests, passionless,\r\nbut curious for all knowledge, an assimilator of new ideas, a\r\ndissolver of old beliefs, an intermediary between science and the\r\nworld of fashion, a discreet insinuator of doubts, who smiled but\r\nnever condescended to laugh, an intelligence supple, subtle, and\r\nuntiring.\r\n\r\nIn 1686 he published his _Entretiens sur la Pluralite des Mondes_,\r\nevening conversations between an astronomer and a marchioness,\r\nhalf-scientific, half-gallant, learned coquetries with science, for\r\nwhich he asked no more serious attention than a novel might require,\r\nwhile he communicated the theories of Descartes and the discoveries\r\nof Galileo, suggested that science is our safest way to truth, and\r\nthat truth at best is not absolute but relative to the human\r\nunderstanding. The _Histoire des Oracles_, in which the cargo of Dutch\r\nerudition that loaded his original by Van Dale is skilfully lightened,\r\nglided to the edge of theological storm. Fontenelle would show that\r\nthe pagan oracles were not delivered by demons, and did not cease\r\nat the coming of Jesus Christ; innocent opinions, but apt to\r\nillustrate the origins and growth of superstitions, from which we\r\ntoo may not be wholly free in spite of all our advantages of true\r\nreligion and sound philosophy. Of course God's chosen people are not\r\nlike unguided Greeks or Romans; and yet human beings are much the\r\nsame in all times and places. The Jesuit Baltus scented heresy, and\r\nFontenelle was very ready to admit that the devil was a prophet, since\r\nFather Baltus wished it so to be, and held the opinion to be orthodox.\r\n\r\nAppointed perpetual secretary of the _Academie des Sciences_ in 1697,\r\nFontenelle pronounced during forty years the panegyrics of those who\r\nhad been its members. These _Eloges des Academiciens_ are\r\nmasterpieces in a difficult art, luminous, dignified, generous\r\nwithout ostentation, plain without poverty of thought or expression.\r\nThe discreet Fontenelle loved tranquillity--\"If I had my hand full\r\nof truths, I should take good care before I opened it.\" He never lost\r\na friend, acting on two prudent maxims, \"Everything is possible,\"\r\nand \"Every one is right.\" \"It is not a heart,\" said Madame de Tencin,\r\n\"which you have in your breast; it is a brain.\" It was a kindly brain,\r\nwhich could be for a moment courageous. And thus it was possible for\r\nhim to enter his hundredth year, still interested in ideas, still\r\ntranquil and alert.\r\n\r\nA great arsenal for the uses of eighteenth-century philosophy was\r\nconstructed and stored by PIERRE BAYLE (1647-1706) in his\r\n_Dictionnaire Historique et Critique_, of which the first edition\r\nwas published in 1697. Science, which found its popular interpreter\r\nin Fontenelle, was a region hardly entered by Bayle; the general\r\nhistory of Europe, from the close of the mediaeval period, and\r\nespecially the records in every age of mythologies, religions,\r\ntheologies, philosophies, formed his province, and it was one of wide\r\nextent. Born in 1647, son of a Protestant pastor, educated by Jesuits,\r\nconverted by them and reconverted, professor of philosophy at Sedan,\r\na fugitive to Rotterdam, professor there of history and philosophy,\r\ndeprived of his position for unorthodox opinions, Bayle found rest\r\nnot in cessation from toil, but in the research of a sceptical scholar,\r\npeaceably and endlessly pursued.\r\n\r\nHis early zeal of proselytism languished and expired. In its place\r\ncame a boundless curiosity, a penetrating sagacity. His vast\r\naccumulations of knowledge were like those of the students of the\r\nRenaissance. The tendencies of his intellect anticipate the\r\ntendencies of the eighteenth century, but with him scepticism had\r\nnot become ambitious or dogmatic. He followed tranquilly where reason\r\nand research led, and saw no cause why religion and morals more than\r\nany other subjects should not be submitted to the scrutiny of rational\r\ninquiry. Since men have held all beliefs, and are more prone to error\r\nthan apt to find the truth, why should any opinions be held sacred?\r\nLet us ascertain and expose the facts. In doing so, we shall learn\r\nthe lesson of universal tolerance; and if the principle of authority\r\nin matters of religion be gently sapped, can this be considered an\r\nevil? Morals, which have their foundation in the human understanding,\r\nremain, though all theologies may be in doubt. If the idea of\r\nProvidence be a superstition, why should not man guide his life by\r\ngood sense and moderation? Bayle did not attack existing beliefs with\r\nthe battering-ram: he quietly removed a stone here and a stone there\r\nfrom the foundations. If he is aggressive, it is by means of a tranquil\r\nirony. The errors of human-kind are full of curious interest; the\r\ndisputes of theologians are both curious and amusing; the moral\r\nlicences of men and women are singular and often diverting. Why not\r\ninstruct and entertain our minds with the facts of the world?\r\n\r\nThe instruction is delivered by Bayle in the dense and sometimes heavy\r\ncolumns of his text; the entertainment will be found in the rambling\r\ngossip, interspersed with illuminating ideas, of his notes. Almost\r\nevery eminent writer of the eighteenth century was a debtor to Bayle's\r\nDictionary. He kept his contemporaries informed of all that was added\r\nto knowledge in his periodical publication, _Nouvelles de la\r\nRepublique des Lettres_ (begun in 1684). He called himself a\r\ncloud-compeller: \"My gift is to create doubts; but they are no more\r\nthan doubts.\" Yet there is light, if not warmth, in such a genius\r\nfor criticism as his; and it was light not only for France, but for\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE FOURTH\r\n_THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\nMEMOIRS AND HISTORY--POETRY--THE THEATRE--THE NOVEL\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe literature of the second half of the seventeenth century was\r\nmonarchical, Christian, classical. The eighteenth century was to\r\nlose the spirit of classical art while retaining many of its forms,\r\nto overthrow the domination of the Church, to destroy the monarchy.\r\nIt was an age not of great art but of militant ideas, which more and\r\nmore came to utilise art as their vehicle. Political speculation,\r\ncriticism, science, sceptical philosophy invaded literature. The\r\ninfluence of England--of English free-thinkers, political writers,\r\nmen of science, essayists, novelists, poets--replaced the influence\r\nof Italy and Spain, and for long that of the models of ancient Greece\r\nand Rome. The century of the philosophers was eminently social and\r\nmundane; the _salons_ revived; a new preciosity came into fashion;\r\nbut as time went on the _salons_ became rather the mart of ideas\r\nphilosophical and scientific than of the daintinesses of letters and\r\nof art. Journalism developed, and thought tended to action, applied\r\nitself directly to public life. While the work of destructive\r\ncriticism proceeded, the bases of a moral reconstruction were laid;\r\nthe free play of intellect was succeeded by a great enfranchisement\r\nof the passions; the work of Voltaire was followed by the work of\r\nRousseau.\r\n\r\nBefore the close of the reign of Louis XIV. the old order of things\r\nhad suffered a decline. War, famine, public debt, oppressive taxation\r\nhad discredited the monarchy. A dull hypocrisy hardly disguised the\r\ngross licentiousness of the times. The revocation of the edict of\r\nNantes had exiled those Protestants who formed a substantial part\r\nof the moral conscience of France. The bitter feud of brother-bishops,\r\nBossuet and Fenelon, hurling defiance against each other for the love\r\nof God, had made religion a theme for mockery. Port-Royal, once the\r\nrefuge of serious faith and strict morals, was destroyed. The bull\r\n_Unigenitus_ expelled the spiritual element from French Christianity,\r\nreduced the clergy to a state of intellectual impotence, and made\r\na lasting breach between them and the better part of the laity.\r\nMeanwhile the scientific movement had been proving its power. Science\r\nhad come to fill the place left void by religion. The period of the\r\nRegency (1715-23) is one of transition from the past to the newer\r\nage, shameless in morals, degraded in art; the period of Voltaire\r\nfollowed, when intellect sapped and mined the old beliefs; with\r\nRousseau came the explosion of sentiment and an effort towards\r\nreconstruction. A great political and social revolution closed the\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe life of the time is seen in many memoirs, and in the correspondence\r\nof many distinguished persons, both men and women. Among the former\r\nthe _Memoires_ of Mdlle. Delaunay, afterwards Mme. de Staal\r\n(1684-1750) are remarkable for the vein of melancholy, subdued by\r\nirony, underlying a style which is formed for fine and clear exactness.\r\nThe Duchesse du Maine's lady-in-waiting, daughter of a poor painter,\r\nbut educated with care, drew delicately in her literary art with an\r\netcher's tool, and her hand was controlled by a spirit which had in\r\nit something of the Stoic. The _Souvenirs_ of Mme. de Caylus\r\n(1673-1729), niece of Mme. de Maintenon--\"jamais de creature plus\r\nseduisante,\" says Saint-Simon--give pictures of the court, charming\r\nin their naivete, grace, and mirth. Mme. d'Epinay, designing to tell\r\nthe story of her own life, disguised as a piece of fiction, became\r\nin her _Memoires_ the chronicler of the manners of her time. The\r\nsociety of the _salons_ and the men of letters is depicted in the\r\nMemoirs of Marmontel. These are but examples from an abundant\r\nliterature constantly augmented to the days of Mme. de Campan and\r\nMme. Roland. The general aspect of the social world in the mid-century\r\nis presented by the historian Duclos (1704-1772) in his\r\n_Considerations sur les Moeurs de ce Siecle_, and with reparation\r\nfor his previous neglect of the part played in society by women in\r\nhis _Memoires pour servir a l'Histoire du XVIIIe Siecle_.\r\n\r\nAs much or more may be learnt from the letter-writers as from the\r\nwriters of memoirs. If Voltaire did not take the first place by his\r\ncorrespondence, so vast, so luminous, so comprehensive, it might\r\njustly be assigned to his friend Mme. du Deffand (1697-1780), whose\r\nlucid intelligence perceived everything, whose disabused heart\r\nseemed detached until old age from all that most interested her\r\nunderstanding. For clear good sense we turn to the Marquise de Lambert,\r\nfor bourgeois worth and kindliness to Mme. Geoffrin, for passion which\r\nkindles the page to Mdlle. de Lespinasse, for sensibility and romance\r\nripening to political ardour and strenuous convictions to Mme. Roland.\r\nAmong the philosophers Diderot pours the torrent, clear or turbid,\r\nof his genius into his correspondence with affluent improvisation;\r\nD'Alembert is grave, temperate, lucid; the Abbe Galiani, the little\r\nMachiavel--\"a pantomime from head to foot,\" said Diderot--the gay\r\nNeapolitan punchinello, given the freedom of Paris, that \"capital\r\nof curiosity,\" is at once wit, cynic, thinker, scholar, and buffoon.\r\nThese, again, are but examples from an epistolary swarm.\r\n\r\nWhile the eighteenth century thus mirrored itself in memoirs and\r\nletters, it did not forget the life of past centuries. The studious\r\nBenedictines, who had already accomplished much, continued their\r\nerudite labours. Nicolas Freret (1688-1749), taking all antiquity\r\nfor his province, illuminated the study of chronology, geography,\r\nsciences, arts, language, religion. Daniel and Velly narrated the\r\nhistory of France. Vertot (1655-1735), with little of the spirit of\r\nhistorical fidelity, displayed certain gifts of an historical artist.\r\nThe school of scepticism was represented by the Jesuit Hardouin, who\r\ndoubted the authenticity of all records of the past except those of\r\nhis own numismatic treasures. Questions as to the principles of\r\nhistorical certitude occupied the Academy of Inscriptions during\r\nmany sittings from 1720 onwards, and produced a body of important\r\nstudies. While the Physiocrats were endeavouring to demonstrate that\r\nthere is a natural order in social circumstances, a philosophy of\r\nhistory, which bound the ages together, was developed in the writings\r\nof Montesquieu and Turgot, if not of Voltaire. The _Esprit des Lois_,\r\nthe _Essai sur les Moeurs_, and Turgot's discourses, delivered in\r\n1750 at the Sorbonne, contributed in different degrees and ways\r\ntowards a new and profounder conception of the life of societies or\r\nof humanity. By Turgot for the first time the idea of progress was\r\naccepted as the ruling principle of history. It cannot be denied that,\r\nas regards the sciences of inorganic nature, he more than foreshadowed\r\nComte's theory of the three states, theological, metaphysical, and\r\npositive, through which the mind of humanity is alleged to have\r\ntravelled.\r\n\r\nIn the second half of the century, history tended to become\r\ndoctrinaire, aggressive, declamatory--a pamphlet in the form of\r\ntreatise or narrative. Morelly wrote in the interest of socialistic\r\nideas, which correspond to those of modern collectivism. Mably,\r\ninspired at first by enthusiasm for the ancient republics, advanced\r\nto a communistic creed. Condorcet, as the century drew towards a close,\r\nbringing together the ideas of economists and historians, traced\r\nhuman progress through the past, and uttered ardent prophecies of\r\nhuman perfectibility in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nPoetry other than dramatic grew in the eighteenth century upon a\r\nshallow soil. The more serious and the more ardent mind of the time\r\nwas occupied with science, the study of nature, the study of society,\r\nphilosophical speculation, the criticism of religion, of government,\r\nand of social arrangements. The old basis of belief upon which reposed\r\nthe great art of the preceding century had given way. The analytic\r\nintellect distrusted the imagination. The conventions of a brilliant\r\nsociety were unfavourable to the contemplative mood of high poetry.\r\nThe tyranny of the \"rules\" remained when the enthusiasm which found\r\nguidance and a safeguard in the rules had departed. The language\r\nitself had lost in richness, variety, harmony, and colour; it was\r\nan admirable instrument for the intellect, but was less apt to render\r\nsensations and passions; when employed for the loftier purposes of\r\nart it tended to the oratorical, with something of over-emphasis and\r\nstrain. The contention of La Motte-Houdart that verse denaturalises\r\nand deforms ideas, expresses the faith of the time, and La Motte's\r\nown cold and laboured odes did not tend to refute his theory.\r\n\r\nChaulieu (1639-1720), the \"poete de la bonne compagnie,\" an\r\nanacreontic senior, patriarch of pleasure, survived the classical\r\ncentury, and sang his songs of facile, epicurean delights; his friend\r\nLa Fare (1644-1712) survived, but slept and ate more than a songster\r\nshould. Anthony Hamilton (1646?-1720) wrote graceful verses, and in\r\nhis brilliant _Memoires de la Vie du Comte de Gramont_ became the\r\nhistorian of the amorous intrigues of the court of Charles II.\r\nJean-Baptiste Rousseau (1670-1741), who in the days of Mme. de\r\nMaintenon's authority had in his sacred _Cantates_ been pious by\r\ncommand, recompensed himself by retailing unbecoming epigrams--and\r\nfor epigram he had a genuine gift--to the Society of the Temple. He\r\nmanufactured odes with skill in the mechanism of verse, and carefully\r\nsecured the fine disorder required in that form of art by factitious\r\nenthusiasm and the abuse of mythology and allegory. When Rousseau\r\ndied, Lefranc de Pompignan mourned for \"le premier chantre du monde,\"\r\nreborn as the Orpheus of France, in a poem which alone of Lefranc's\r\nnumerous productions--and by virtue of two stanzas--has not that\r\nsanctity ascribed to them by Voltaire, the sanctity which forbids\r\nany one to touch them. Why name their fellows and successors in the\r\neighteenth-century art of writing poems without poetry?\r\n\r\nLouis Racine (1692-1763), son of the author of _Athalie_, in his\r\nversified discourses on _La Grace_ and _La Religion_ was devout and\r\nedifying, but with an edification which promotes slumber. If a poet\r\nin sympathy with the philosophers desired to edify, he described the\r\nphenomena of nature as Saint-Lambert (1716-1803) did in his\r\n_Saisons_--\"the only work of our century,\" Voltaire assured the\r\nauthor, \"which will reach posterity.\" To describe meant to draw out\r\nthe inventory of nature's charms with an eye not on the object but\r\non the page of the Encyclopaedia, and to avoid the indecency of naming\r\nanything in direct and simple speech. The _Seasons_ of Saint-Lambert\r\nwere followed by the _Months_ (_Mois_) of Roucher (1745-94)--\"the\r\nmost beautiful poetic shipwreck of the century,\" said the malicious\r\nRivarol--and by the _Jardins_ of Delille (1738-1813). When Delille\r\ntranslated the _Georgics_ he was saluted by Voltaire as the Abbe\r\nVirgil.[1] The _salons_ heard him with rapture recite his verses as\r\nfrom the tripod of inspiration. He was the favourite of\r\nMarie-Antoinette. Aged and blind, he was a third with Homer and Milton.\r\nIn death they crowned his forehead, and for three days the mourning\r\ncrowd gazed on all that remained of their great poet. And yet Delille's\r\n_Jardins_ is no better than a patchwork of carpet-gardening, in which\r\nthe flowers are theatrical paper-flowers. If anything lives from the\r\ndescriptive poetry of the eighteenth century, it is a few detached\r\nlines from the writings of Lemierre.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Or was this Rivarol's ironical jest?]\r\n\r\nThe successor of J.-B. Rousseau in the grand ode was Ecouchard Lebrun\r\n(1729-1807), rival of Pindar. All he wanted to equal Pindar was some\r\nforgetfulness of self, some warmth, some genuine enthusiasm, some\r\nharmony, a touch of genius; a certain dignity of imagination he\r\nexhibits in his best moments. If we say that he honoured Buffon and\r\nwas the friend of Andre Chenier, we have said in his praise that which\r\ngives him the highest distinction; yet it may be added that if he\r\noften falsified the ode, he, like Rousseau, excelled in epigram. It\r\nwas not the great lyric but _le petit lyrisme_ which blossomed and\r\nran to seed in the thin poetic soil. The singers of fragile loves\r\nand trivial pleasures are often charming, and as often they are merely\r\nfrivolous or merely depraved. Grecourt; Piron; Bernard, the curled\r\nand powdered Anacreon; Bernis, Voltaire's \"Babet la Bouquetiere,\"\r\nKing Frederick's poet of \"sterile abundance\"; Dorat, who could\r\nflutter at times with an airy grace; Bertin, born in the tropics,\r\nand with the heat of the senses in his verse; Parny, an estray in\r\nParis from the palms and fountains of the Isle Bourbon, the \"dear\r\nTibullus\" of Voltaire--what a swarm of butterflies, soiled or\r\nshining!\r\n\r\nIf two or three poets deserve to be distinguished from the rest, one\r\nis surely JEAN-BAPTISTE-LOUIS GRESSET (1709-77), whose parrot\r\n_Vert-Vert_, instructed by the pious Sisters, demoralised by the\r\nboatmen of the Loire, still edifies and scandalises the lover of happy\r\nbadinage in verse; one is the young and unfortunate\r\nNICOLAS-JOSEPH-LAURENT GILBERT (1751-80), less unfortunate and less\r\ngifted than the legend makes him, yet luckless enough and embittered\r\nenough to become the satirist of Academicians and philosophers and\r\nthe society which had scorned his muse; and the third is JEAN-PIERRE\r\nCLARIS DE FLORIAN (1755-94), the amiable fabulist, who, lacking La\r\nFontaine's lyric genius, fine harmonies, and penetrating good sense,\r\nyet can tell a story with pleasant ease, and draw a moral with gentle\r\npropriety.\r\n\r\nIn every poetic form, except comedy, that he attempted, Voltaire\r\nstands high among his contemporaries; they give us a measure of his\r\nrange and excellence. But the two greatest poets of the eighteenth\r\ncentury wrote in prose. Its philosophical poet was the naturalist\r\nBuffon; its supreme lyrist was the author of _La Nouvelle Heloise_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nIn the history of French tragedy only one name of importance--that\r\nof Crebillon--is to be found in the interval between Racine and\r\nVoltaire. Campistron feebly, Danchet formally and awkwardly,\r\nimitated Racine; Duche followed him in sacred tragedy; La\r\nGrange-Chancel (author of the _Philippiques_, directed against the\r\nRegent) followed him in tragedies on classical subjects. If any piece\r\ndeserves to be distinguished above the rest, it is the _Manlius_\r\n(1698) of La Fosse, a work--suggestive rather of Corneille than of\r\nRacine--which was founded on the _Venice Preserved_ of Otway. The\r\nart of Racine languished in inferior hands. The eighteenth century,\r\nwhile preserving its form, thought to reanimate it by the provocatives\r\nof scenic decoration and more rapid and more convulsive action.\r\n\r\nPROSPER JOLYOT DE CREBILLON (1674-1762), a diligent reader of\r\nseventeenth-century romances, transported the devices of romance,\r\nits horrors, its pathetic incidents, its disguises, its surprises,\r\nits discoveries, into the theatre, and substituted a tragedy of\r\nviolent situations for the tragedy of character. His _Rhadamiste et\r\nZenobie_ (1711), which has an air of Corneillean grandeur and heroism,\r\nnotwithstanding a plot so complicated that it is difficult to follow,\r\nwas received with unmeasured enthusiasm. To be atrocious within the\r\nrules was to create a new and thrilling sensation. Torrents of tears\r\nflowed for the unhappy heroine of La Motte's _Ines de Castro_ (1723),\r\nsecretly married to the Prince of Portugal, and pardoned only when\r\nthe fatal poison is in her veins. Voltaire's effort to renovate\r\nclassical tragedy was that of a writer who loved the theatre, first\r\nfor its own sake, afterwards as an instrument for influencing public\r\nopinion, who conceived tragedy aright as the presentation of\r\ncharacter and passion seen in action. His art suffered from his\r\nextreme facility, from his inability (except it be in _Zaire_) to\r\nattain dramatic self-detachment, from the desire to conquer his\r\nspectators in the readiest ways, by striking situations, or, at a\r\nlater date, by the rhetoric of philosophical doctrine and sentiment.\r\n\r\nThere is no one, with all his faults, to set beside Voltaire. Piron\r\nand Gresset are remembered, not by their tragedies, but each by a\r\nsingle comedy. Marmontel's Memoirs live; his tales have a faded glory;\r\nas for his tragedies, the ingenious stage asp which hissed as the\r\ncurtain fell on his _Cleopatre_, was a sound critic of their\r\nmediocrity. Lemierre, with some theatrical talent, wrote ill; as the\r\nlove of spectacle grew, he permitted his William Tell to shoot the\r\napple, and his widow of Malabar to die in flames upon the stage.\r\n\r\nSaurin in _Spartacus_ (1760) declaimed and dissertated in the manner\r\nof Voltaire. De Belloy at a lucky moment showed, in his _Siege de\r\nCalais_ (1765), that rhetorical patriotism had survived the Seven\r\nYears' War; he was supposed to have founded that national, historic\r\ndrama which the President Henault had projected; but with the _Siege\r\nde Calais_ the national drama rose and fell. Laharpe (1739-1803) was\r\nthe latest writer who compounded classical tragedy according to the\r\napproved recipe. In the last quarter of the century Shakespeare became\r\nknown to the French public through the translation of Letourneur.\r\nBefore that translation began to appear, JEAN-FRANCOIS DUCIS\r\n(1733-1816), the patron of whose imagination was his \"Saint\r\nGuillaume\" of Stratford, though he knew no English, had in a fashion\r\npresented Hamlet (1769) and Romeo and Juliet to his countrymen; King\r\nLear, Macbeth, King John, Othello (1792) followed. But Ducis came\r\na generation too soon for a true Shakespearian rendering; simple and\r\nheroic in his character as a man, he belonged to an age of philosophers\r\nand sentimentalists, an age of \"virtue\" and \"nature.\" Shakespeare's\r\ntranslation is as strange as that of his own Bottom. Ophelia is the\r\ndaughter of King Claudius; the Queen dies by her own hand; old Montague\r\nis a Montague-Ugolino who has devoured his sons; Malcolm is believed\r\nto be a mountaineer's child; Lear is borne on the stage, sleeping\r\non a bed of roses, that he may behold a sunrise; Hedelmone (Desdemona)\r\nis no longer Othello's wife; Iago disappears; Desdemona's\r\nhandkerchief is not among the properties; and Juliet's lark is\r\nvoiceless. Eighteenth-century tragedy is indeed a city of tombs.\r\n\r\nComedy made some amends. Before the appearance of Regnard, the actor\r\nBaron, Moliere's favourite pupil, had given a lively play--_L'Homme\r\na bonne Fortune_ (1686). JEAN-FRANCOIS REGNARD (1655-1709) escaped\r\nfrom his corsair captors and slavery at Algiers, made his sorry\r\ncompany of knaves and fools acceptable by virtue of inexhaustible\r\ngaiety, bright fantasy, and the liveliest of comic styles. His\r\n_Joueur_ (1696) is a scapegrace, possessed by the passion of gaming,\r\nwhose love of Angelique is a devotion to her dowry, but he will console\r\nhimself for lost love by another throw of the dice. His _Legataire\r\nUniversel_, greedy, old, and ailing, is surrounded by pitiless rogues,\r\nyet the curtain falls on a general reconciliation. Regnard's morals\r\nmay be doubtful, but his mirth is unquestionable.\r\n\r\nDancourt (1661-1725), with a far less happy style, had a truer power\r\nof observation, and as quick an instinct for theatrical effects; he\r\nexhibits in the _Chevalier a la Mode_ and the _Bourgeoises a la Mode_,\r\nif not with exact fidelity, at least in telling caricature, the\r\nstruggle of classes in the society around him, wealth ambitious for\r\nrank, rank prepared to sell itself for wealth. The same spirit of\r\ncynical gaiety inspires the _Double Veuvage_ of Charles Riviere\r\nDufresny (1655?-1724), where husband and wife, each disappointed in\r\nfalse tidings of the other's death, exhibit transports of feigned\r\njoy on meeting, and assist in the marriage of their respective lovers,\r\neach to accomplish the vexation of the other. Among such plays as\r\nthese the _Turcaret_ (1709) of Lesage appears as the creation of a\r\ntype, and a type which verifies itself as drawn with a realism powerful\r\nand unfaltering.\r\n\r\nIn striking contrast with Lesage's bold and bitter satire are the\r\ncomedies of Marivaux, delicate indeed in observation of life and\r\ncharacter, skilled in their exploration of the byways of the heart,\r\nbrilliant in fantasy, subtle in sentiment, lightly touched by the\r\nsensuality of the day. Philippe Nericault Destouches (1680-1754) had\r\nthe ambition to revive the comedy of character, and by its means to\r\nread moral lessons on the stage; unfortunately what he lacked was\r\ncomic power. In his most celebrated piece, _Le Glorieux_, he returns\r\nto the theme treated by Dancourt of the struggle between the ruined\r\nnoblesse and the aspiring middle class. Pathos and something of\r\nromance are added to comedy.\r\n\r\nAlready those tendencies which were to produce the so-called _comedie\r\nlarmoyante_ were at work. Piron (1689-1773), who regarded it with\r\nhostility, undesignedly assisted in its creation; _Les Fils Ingrats_,\r\nnamed afterwards _L'Ecole des Peres_, given in 1728, the story of\r\na too generous father of ungrateful children, a play designed for\r\nmirth, was in fact fitter to draw tears than to excite laughter.\r\nPiron's special gift, however, was for satire. In _La Metromanie_\r\nhe smiles at the folly of the aspirant poet with all his cherished\r\nillusions; yet young Damis with his folly, the innocent error of a\r\ngenerous spirit, wins a sympathy to which the duller representatives\r\nof good sense can make no claim. It is satire also which gives whatever\r\ncomic force it possesses to the one comedy of Gresset that is not\r\nforgotten: _Le Mechant_ (1747), a disloyal comrade, would steal the\r\nheart of his friend's beloved; soubrette and valet conspire to expose\r\nthe traitor; but Cleon, who loves mischief in the spirit of sport,\r\nthough unmasked, is little disconcerted. Brilliant in lines and\r\nspeeches, _Le Mechant_ is defective in its composition as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe decline in a feeling for composition, for art, for the severity\r\nof outline, was accompanied by a development of the emotional or\r\nsentimental element in drama. As sensibility was quickened, and\r\nwealth and ease increased, little things came to be felt as important.\r\nThe middle class advanced in prosperity and power. Why should emperors\r\nand kings, queens and princesses occupy the stage? Why neglect the\r\njoys and griefs of every-day domestic life? If \"nature\" and \"virtue\"\r\nwere to be honoured, why not seek them here? Man, the new philosophy\r\ntaught, is essentially good; human nature is of itself inclined to\r\nvirtue; if it strays through force of circumstance into vice or folly,\r\nshould not its errors be viewed with sympathy, with tenderness? Thus\r\ncomedy grew serious, and tragedy put off its exalted airs; the genius\r\nof tragedy and the genius of comedy were wedded, and the _comedie\r\nlarmoyante_, which might be named more correctly the bourgeois drama,\r\nwas born of this union.\r\n\r\nIn the plays of NIVELLE DE LA CHAUSEE (1692-1754) the new type is\r\nalready formed. The relations of wife and husband, of father and child,\r\nform the theme of all his plays. In _Melanide_, father and son,\r\nunrecognised, are rivals in love; the wife and mother, supposed to\r\nbe dead, is discovered; the husband returns to her arms, and is\r\nreconciled to his son. It is the victory of nature and of innate\r\ngoodness; comic intention and comic power are wholly absent. La\r\nChausee's morals are those of an optimist; but those modern domestic\r\ntragedies, the ethics of which do not err by over-sanguine views of\r\nhuman nature, may trace their ancestry to _Melanide_.\r\n\r\nFor such serious comedy or bourgeois drama the appropriate vehicle,\r\nso Diderot maintained, is prose. Diderot, among his many gifts, did\r\nnot possess a talent for dramatic writing. But as a critic his\r\ninfluence was considerable. Midway between tragedy and comedy he\r\nperceived a place for the serious drama; to right and left, on either\r\nside of the centre, were spaces for forms approximating, the one to\r\ntragedy, the other to comedy. The hybrid species of tragi-comedy he\r\nwholly condemned; each genre, as he conceived it, is a unity\r\ncontaining its own principle of life. The function of the theatre\r\nis less to represent character fully formed than to study the natural\r\nhistory of character, to exhibit the environments which determine\r\ncharacter. Its purpose is to moralise life, and the chief means of\r\nmoralisation is that effusive sensibility which is the outflow of\r\nthe inherent goodness of human nature.\r\n\r\nDiderot attempted to justify his theory by examples, and only proved\r\nhis own incapacity as a writer for the stage. His friend SEDAINE\r\n(1719-97) was more fortunate. Of the bourgeois drama of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, _Le Philosophe sans le savoir_ alone survives. It is little\r\nmore than a domestic anecdote rendered dramatic, but it has life and\r\nreality. The merchant Vanderk's daughter is to be married; but on\r\nthe same day his son, resenting an insult to his father, must expose\r\nhis life in a duel. Old Antoine, the intendant, would take his young\r\nmaster's place of danger; Antoine's daughter, Victorine,\r\nhalf-unawares has given her heart to the gallant duellist. Hopes and\r\nfears, joy and grief contend in the Vanderk habitation. Sedaine made\r\na true capture of a little province of nature. When Mercier\r\n(1740-1814) tried to write in the same vein, his \"nature\" was that\r\nof declamatory sentiment imposed upon trivial incidents.\r\nBeaumarchais, in his earlier pieces, was tearful and romantic;\r\nhappily he repented him of his lugubrious sentiment, and restored\r\nto France its old gaiety in the _Barbier de Seville_ and the inimitable\r\n_Mariage de Figaro_; but amid the mirth of _Figaro_ can be heard the\r\ndetonation of approaching revolutionary conflict.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe history of the novel in the eighteenth century corresponds with\r\nthe general movement of ideas; the novel begins as art, and proceeds\r\nto propagandism. ALAIN-RENE LESAGE, born at Sarzeau, near Vannes,\r\nin 1668, belongs as much to the seventeenth as to the eighteenth\r\ncentury. His life of nearly eighty years (died 1747) was the\r\nhonourable life of a bourgeois, who was also a man of genius, and\r\nwho maintained his own independence and that of his wife and children\r\nby the steadfast diligence of his pen. He was no passionate reformer,\r\nno preacher of ideas; he observed life and human nature with shrewd\r\ncommon-sense, seeing men in general as creatures in whom good and\r\nevil are mixed; his imagination combined and vivified all he had\r\nobserved; and he recorded the results of his study of the world in\r\na style admirable for naturalness and ease, though these were not\r\nattained without the careful practice of literary art.\r\n\r\nFrom translations for the readers of fiction and for the theatre,\r\nhe advanced to free adaptations, and from these to work which may\r\nbe called truly original. Directed by the Abbe de Lyonne to Spanish\r\nliterature, he endeavoured in his early plays to preserve what was\r\nbrilliant and ingenious in the works of Spanish dramatists, and to\r\navoid what was strained and extravagant. In his _Crispin Rival de\r\nson Maitre_ (1707), in which the roguish valet aspires to carry off\r\nhis master's betrothed and her fortune, he borrows only the idea of\r\nMendoza's play; the conduct of the action, the dialogue, the\r\ncharacters are his own. His prose story of the same year, _Le Diable\r\nBoiteux_, owes but little to the suggestion derived from Guevara;\r\nit is, in fact, more nearly related to the _Caracteres_ of La Bruyere;\r\nwhen Asmodeus discloses what had been hidden under the house-roofs\r\nof the city, a succession of various human types are presented, and,\r\nas in the case of La Bruyere, contemporaries attempted to identify\r\nthese with actual living persons.\r\n\r\nIn his remarkable satiric comedy _Turcaret_, and in his realistic\r\nnovel _Gil Blas_, Lesage enters into full possession of his own genius.\r\n_Turcaret, ou le Financier_, was completed early in 1708; the efforts\r\nof the financiers to hinder its performance served in the end to\r\nenhance its brief and brilliant success. The pitiless amasser of\r\nwealth, Turcaret, is himself the dupe of a coquette, who in her turn\r\nis the victim of a more contemptible swindler. Lesage, presenting\r\na fragment of the manners and morals of his day, keeps us in\r\nexceedingly ill company, but the comic force of the play lightens\r\nthe oppression of its repulsive characters. It is the first\r\nmasterpiece of the eighteenth-century _comedie de moeurs_.\r\n\r\nMuch of Lesage's dramatic work was produced only for the hour or the\r\nmoment--pieces thrown off, sometimes with brilliance and wit, for\r\nthe _Theatres de la Foire_, where farces, vaudevilles, and comic opera\r\nwere popular. They served to pay for the bread of his household. His\r\ngreat comedy, however, a comedy in a hundred acts, is the story of\r\n_Gil Blas_. Its composition was part of his employment during many\r\nyears; the first volumes appeared in 1715, the last volume in 1735.\r\nThe question of a Spanish original for the story is settled--there\r\nwas none; but from Spanish fiction and from Spanish history Lesage\r\nborrowed what suited his purpose, without in any way compromising\r\nhis originality. To the picaresque tales (and among these may be noted\r\na distant precursor of _Gil Blas_ in the _Francion_ of Charles Sorel)\r\nhe added his own humanity, and in place of a series of vulgar\r\nadventures we are given a broad picture of social life; the comedy\r\nof manners and intrigue grows, as the author proceeds, into a comedy\r\nof character, and to this something of the historical novel is added.\r\nThe unity of the book is found in the person of Gil Blas himself:\r\nhe is far from being a hero, but he is capable of receiving all\r\nimpressions; he is an excellent observer of life, his temper is bright,\r\nhe is free from ill-nature; we meet in him a pleasant companion, and\r\naccompany him with sympathy through the amusing Odyssey of his varied\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\nAs a moralist Lesage is the reverse of severe, but he is far from\r\nbeing base. \"All is easy and good-humoured,\" wrote Sir Walter Scott,\r\n\"gay, light, and lively; even the cavern of the robbers is illuminated\r\nwith a ray of that wit with which Lesage enlightens his whole narrative.\r\nIt is a work which renders the reader pleased with himself and with\r\nmankind, where faults are placed before him in the light of follies\r\nrather than vices, and where misfortunes are so interwoven with the\r\nludicrous that we laugh in the very act of sympathising with them.\"\r\nIn the earlier portion incidents preponderate over character; in the\r\nclose, some signs of the writer's fatigue appear. Of Lesage's other\r\ntales and translations, _Le Bachelier de Salamanque_ (1736) takes\r\ndeservedly the highest rank.\r\n\r\nWith PIERRE CARLET DE CHAMBLAIN DE MARIVAUX (1688-1763) the novel\r\nceases to be primarily a study of manners or a romance of adventures;\r\nit becomes an analysis of passions to which manners and adventures\r\nare subordinate. As a journalist he may be said to have proceeded\r\nfrom Addison; by his novels he prepared the way for Richardson and\r\nfor Rousseau. His early travesties of Homer and of Fenelon's\r\n_Telemaque_ seem to indicate a tendency towards realism, but\r\nMarivaux's realism took the form not so much of observation of society\r\nin its breadth and variety as of psychological analysis. If he did\r\nnot know the broad highway of the heart, he traversed many of its\r\nsecret paths. His was a feminine spirit, delicate, fragile, curious,\r\nunconcerned about general ideas; and yet, while untiring in his\r\nanatomy of the passions, he was not truly passionate; his heart may\r\nbe said to have been in his head.\r\n\r\nIn the opening of the eighteenth century there was a revival of\r\npreciosity, which Moliere had never really killed, and in the _salon_\r\nof Madame de Lambert, Marivaux may have learned something of his\r\nmetaphysics of love and something of his subtleties or affectations\r\nof style. He anticipates the sensibility of the later part of the\r\ncentury; but sensibility with Marivaux is not profound, and it is\r\nrelieved by intellectual vivacity. His conception of love has in it\r\nnot a little of mere gallantry. Like later eighteenth-century writers,\r\nhe at once exalts \"virtue,\" and indulges his fancy in a licence which\r\ndoes not tend towards good morals or manners. His _Vie de Marianne_\r\n(1731-41), which occupied him during many years, is a picture of\r\nsocial life, and a study, sometimes infinitely subtle, of the emotions\r\nof his heroine; her genius for coquetry is finely allied to her maiden\r\npride; the hypocrite, M. de Climal--old angel fallen--is a new variety\r\nof the family of Tartufe. _Le Paysan Parvenu_ (1735-36), which tells\r\nof the successes of one whom women favour, is on a lower level of\r\nart and of morals. Both novels were left unfinished; and while both\r\nattract, they also repel, and finally weary the reader.[2] Their\r\ninfluence was considerable in converting the romance of adventures\r\ninto the romance of emotional incident and analysis.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The twelfth part of _Marianne_ is by Madam Riccoboni.\r\nOnly five parts of the _Paysan_ are by Marivaux.]\r\n\r\nThe work of Marivaux for the stage is more important than his work\r\nin prose fiction. His comedy has been described as the tragedy of\r\nRacine transposed, with love leading to marriage, not to death. Love\r\nis his central theme--sometimes in conflict with self-love--and\r\nwomen are his protagonists. He discovers passion in its germ, and\r\ntraces it through its shy developments. His plays are little romances\r\nhandled in dramatic fashion; each records some delicate adventure\r\nof the heart. He wrote much for the Comedie-Italienne, where he did\r\nnot suffer from the tyranny of rules and models, and where his graceful\r\nfancy had free play. Of his large repertoire, the most admirable\r\npieces are _Le Jeu de l'Amour et du Hasard_ (1730) and _Les Fausses\r\nConfidences_ (1732). In the former the heroine and her chambermaid\r\nexchange costumes; the hero and his valet make a like exchange; yet\r\nlove is not misled, and heroine and hero find each other through their\r\ndisguises. In _Les Fausses Confidences_ the young widow Araminte is\r\nwon to a second love in spite of her resolve, and becomes the happy\r\nvictim of her own tender heart and of the devices of her assailants.\r\nThe \"marivaudage\" of Marivaux is sometimes a refined and novel mode\r\nof expressing delicate shades and half-shades of feeling; sometimes\r\nan over-refined or over-subtle attempt to express ingenuities of\r\nsentiment, and the result is then frigid, pretentious, or pedantic.\r\nNo one excelled him in the art, described by Voltaire, of weighing\r\nflies' eggs in gossamer scales.\r\n\r\nThe Abbe A.-F. PREVOST D'EXILES (1697-1763) is remembered by a single\r\ntale of rare power and beauty, _Manon Lescaut_, but his work in\r\nliterature was voluminous and varied. Having deserted his\r\nBenedictine monastery in 1728, he led for a time an irregular and\r\nwandering life in England and Holland; then returning to Paris, he\r\ngained a living by swift and ceaseless production for the booksellers.\r\nIn his journal, _Le Pour et le Contre_, he did much to inform his\r\ncountrymen respecting English literature, and among his translations\r\nare those of Richardson's _Pamela_, _Sir Charles Grandison_, and\r\n_Clarissa Harlowe_. Many of his novels are melodramatic narratives\r\nof romantic adventure, having a certain kinship to our later romances\r\nof Anne Radcliffe and Matthew Gregory Lewis, in which horror and pity,\r\nblood and tears abound. Sometimes, however, when he writes of passion,\r\nwe feel that he is engaged in no sport of the imagination, but\r\ntranscribing the impulsive speech of his own tumultuous heart. The\r\n_Memoires d'un Homme de Qualite_, _Cleveland_, _Le Doyen de\r\nKillerine_ are tragic narratives, in which love is the presiding\r\npower.\r\n\r\n_Manon Lescaut_, which appeared in 1731, as an episode of the first\r\nof these, is a tale of fatal and irresistible passion. The heroine\r\nis divided in heart between her mundane tastes for luxury and her\r\nlove for the Chevalier des Grieux. He, knowing her inconstancy and\r\ninfirmity, yet cannot escape from the tyranny of the spell which has\r\nsubdued him; his whole life is absorbed and lost in his devotion to\r\nManon, and he is with her in the American wilds at the moment of her\r\npiteous death. The admirable literary style of _Manon Lescaut_ is\r\nunfelt and disappears, so directly does it bring us into contact with\r\nthe motions of a human heart.\r\n\r\nIn the second half of the eighteenth century, philosophy, on the one\r\nhand, invaded the novel and the short tale; on the other hand it was\r\ninvaded by a flood of sentiment. An irritated and irritating\r\nsensuality could accommodate itself either to sentiment or to\r\nphilosophy. Voltaire's tales are, in narrative form, criticisms of\r\nbelief or opinion which scintillate with ironic wit. His disciple,\r\nMarmontel, would \"render virtue amiable\" in his _Contes Moraux_\r\n(1761), and cure the ravage of passion with a canary's song. His more\r\nambitious _Belisaire_ seems to a modern reader a masterpiece in the\r\n_genre ennuyeux_. His _Incas_ is exotic without colour or credibility.\r\nFlorian, with little skill, imitated the _Incas_ and _Telemaque_,\r\nor was feebly idyllic and conventionally pastoral as a follower of\r\nthe Swiss Gessner. Restif de la Bretonne could be gross, corrupt,\r\ndeclamatory, sentimental, humanitarian in turns or all together.\r\nThree names are eminent--that of Diderot, who flung his good and evil\r\npowers, mingling and fermenting, into his novels as into all else;\r\nthat of Rousseau, who interpreted passion, preached its restraints,\r\ndepicted the charms of the domestic interior, and presented the\r\nglories of external nature in _La Nouvelle Heloise_; that of Bernardin\r\nde Saint-Pierre, who reaches a hand to Rousseau on the one side, and\r\non the other to Chateaubriand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\nMONTESQUIEU--VAUVENARGUES--VOLTAIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe author of _De l'Esprit des Lois_ was as important in the history\r\nof European speculation as in that of French literature; but\r\ninevitable changes of circumstances and ideas have caused his\r\ninfluence to wane. His life was one in which the great events were\r\nthoughts. Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de MONTESQUIEU, was born\r\nin 1689 at La Brede, near Bordeaux. After his years of education by\r\nthe Oratorians, which left him with something of scepticism in his\r\nintellect, and something of stoicism in his character, he pursued\r\nlegal studies, and in 1716 became President of the Parliament of\r\nBordeaux. The scientific researches of his day attracted him;\r\ninvestigating anatomy, botany, natural philosophy, the history of\r\nthe earth, he came to see man as a portion of nature, or at least\r\nas a creature whose life is largely determined by natural laws. With\r\na temper of happy serenity, and an admirable balance of faculties,\r\nhe was possessed by an eager intellectual curiosity. \"I spend my\r\nlife,\" he said, \"in examining; everything interests, everything\r\nsurprises me.\"\r\n\r\nNothing, however, interested him so much as the phenomena of human\r\nsociety; he had no aptitude for metaphysical speculations; his\r\nfeeling for literature and art was defective; he honoured the antique\r\nworld, but it was the Greek and Latin historians and the ideals of\r\nRoman virtue and patriotism which most deeply moved him. At the same\r\ntime he was a man of his own generation, and while essentially serious,\r\nhe explored the frivolous side of life, and yielded his imagination\r\nto the licence of the day.\r\n\r\nWith enough wit and enough wantonness to capture a multitude of\r\nreaders, the _Lettres Persanes_ (1721) contain a serious criticism\r\nof French society in the years of the Regency. It matters little that\r\nthe idea of the book may have been suggested by the Siamese travellers\r\nof Dufresny's _Amusements_; the treatment is essentially original.\r\nThings Oriental were in fashion--Galland had translated the _Arabian\r\nNights_ (1704-1708)--and Montesquieu delighted in books of travel\r\nwhich told of the manners, customs, religions, governments of distant\r\nlands. His Persians, Usbek and Rica, one the more philosophical, the\r\nother the more satirical, visit Europe, inform their friends by letter\r\nof all the aspects of European and especially of French life, and\r\nreceive tidings from Persia of affairs of the East, including the\r\ntroubles and intrigues of the eunuchs and ladies of the harem. The\r\nspirit of the reaction against the despotism of Louis XIV. is\r\nexpressed in Montesquieu's pages; the spirit also of religious\r\nfree-thought, and the reaction against ecclesiastical tyranny. A\r\nsense of the dangers impending over society is present, and of the\r\nneed of temperate reform. Brilliant, daring, ironical, licentious\r\nas the _Persian Letters_ are, the prevailing tone is that of judicious\r\nmoderation; and already something can be discerned of the large views\r\nand wise liberality of the _Esprit des Lois_. The book is valuable\r\nto us still as a document in the social history of the eighteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nIn Paris, Montesquieu formed many distinguished acquaintances, among\r\nothers that of Mlle. de Clermont, sister of the Duke de Bourbon.\r\nPerhaps it was in homage to her that he wrote his prose-poem, which\r\npretends to be a translation from the Greek, _Le Temple de Gnide_\r\n(1725). Its feeling for antiquity is overlaid by the artificialities,\r\nlong since faded, of his own day--\"naught remains,\" writes M. Sorel,\r\n\"but the faint and subtle perfume of a _sachet_ long hidden in a\r\n_rococo_ cabinet.\" Although his publications were anonymous,\r\nMontesquieu was elected a member of the Academy in 1728, and almost\r\nimmediately after this he quitted France for a long course of travel\r\nthroughout Europe, undertaken with the purpose of studying the\r\nmanners, institutions, and governments of foreign lands. At Venice\r\nhe gained the friendship of Lord Chesterfield, and they arrived\r\ntogether in England, where for nearly two years Montesquieu remained,\r\nfrequently hearing the parliamentary debates, and studying the\r\nprinciples of English politics in the writings of Locke. His thoughts\r\non government were deeply influenced by his admiration of the British\r\nconstitution with its union of freedom and order attained by a balance\r\nof the various political powers of the State. On Montesquieu's return\r\nto La Brede he occupied himself with that great work which resumes\r\nthe observations and meditations of twenty years, the _Esprit des\r\nLois_. In the history of Rome, which impressed his imagination with\r\nits vast moral, social, and political significance, he found a signal\r\nexample of the causes which lead a nation to greatness and the causes\r\nwhich contribute to its decline. The study made at this point of view\r\ndetached itself from the more comprehensive work which he had\r\nundertaken, and in 1734 appeared his _Considerations sur les Causes\r\nde la Grandeur et de la Decadence des Romains_.\r\n\r\nBossuet had dealt nobly with Roman history, but in the spirit of a\r\ntheologian expounding the course of Divine Providence in human\r\naffairs. Montesquieu studied the operation of natural causes. His\r\nknowledge, indeed, was incomplete, but it was the knowledge afforded\r\nby the scholarship of his own time. The love of liberty, the patriotic\r\npride, the military discipline, the education in public spirit\r\nattained by discussion, the national fortitude under reverses, the\r\nsupport given to peoples against their rulers, the respect for the\r\nreligion of conquered tribes and races, the practice of dealing at\r\none time with only a single hostile power, are pointed out as\r\ncontributing to the supremacy of Rome in the ancient world. Its\r\ndecadence is explained as the gradual result of its vast overgrowth,\r\nits civil wars, the loss of patriotism among the soldiery engaged\r\nin remote provinces, the inroads of luxury, the proscription of\r\ncitizens, the succession of unworthy rulers, the division of the\r\nEmpire, the incursion of the barbarians; and in treating this portion\r\nof his subject Montesquieu may be said to be wholly original. A short\r\n_Dialogue de Sylla et d'Eucrate_ may be viewed as a pendant to the\r\n_Considerations_, discussing a fragment of the subject in dramatic\r\nform. Montesquieu's desire to arrive at general truths sometimes led\r\nhim to large conclusions resting on too slender a basis of fact; but\r\nthe errors in applying his method detract only a little from the\r\nservice which he rendered to thought in a treatment of history at\r\nleast tending in the direction of philosophic truth.\r\n\r\nThe whole of his mind--almost the whole of his existence--is embodied\r\nin the _Esprit des Lois_ (1748). It lacks the unity of a ruling idea;\r\nit is deficient in construction, in continuity, in cohesion; much\r\nthat it contains has grown obsolete or is obsolescent; yet in the\r\nliterature of eighteenth-century thought it takes, perhaps, the\r\nhighest place; and it must always be precious as the self-revealment\r\nof a great intellect--swift yet patient, ardent yet temperate,\r\nliberal yet the reverse of revolutionary--an intellect that before\r\nall else loved the light. It lacks unity, because its author's mind\r\nwas many-sided, and he would not suppress a portion of himself to\r\nsecure a factitious unity. Montesquieu was a student of science, who\r\nbelieved in the potency of the laws of nature, and he saw that human\r\nsociety is the product of, or at least is largely modified by, natural\r\nlaw; he was also a believer in the power of human reason and human\r\nwill, an admirer of Roman virtue, a citizen, a patriot, and a reformer.\r\nHe would write the natural history of human laws, exhibit the\r\ninvariable principles from which they proceed, and reduce the study\r\nof governments to a science; but at the same time he would exhibit\r\nhow society acts upon itself; he would warn and he would exhort; he\r\nwould help, if possible, to create intelligent and patriotic citizens.\r\nTo these intentions we may add another--that of a criticism, touched\r\nwith satire, of the contemporary political and social arrangements\r\nof France.\r\n\r\nAnd yet again, Montesquieu was a legist, with some of the curiosity\r\nof an antiquary, not without a pride in his rank, interested in its\r\norigins, and desirous to trace the history of feudal laws and\r\nprivileges. The _Esprit des Lois_ is not a doctrinaire exposition\r\nof a theory, but the record of a varied life of thought, in which\r\nthere are certain dominant tendencies, but no single absolute idea.\r\nThe forms of government, according to Montesquieu, are\r\nthree--republic (including both the oligarchical republic and the\r\ndemocratic), monarchy, despotism. Each of these structural\r\narrangements requires a principle, a moral spring, to give it force\r\nand action: the popular republic lives by virtue of patriotism, public\r\nspirit, the love of equality; the aristocratic republic lives by the\r\nspirit of moderation among the members of the ruling class; monarchy\r\nlives by the stimulus of honour, the desire of superiority and\r\ndistinction; despotism draws its vital force from fear; but each of\r\nthese principles may perish through its corruption or excess. The\r\nlaws of each country, its criminal and civil codes, its system of\r\neducation, its sumptuary regulations, its treatment of the relation\r\nof the sexes, are intimately connected with the form of government,\r\nor rather with the principle which animates that form.\r\n\r\nLaws, under the several forms of government, are next considered in\r\nreference to the power of the State for purposes of defence and of\r\nattack. The nature of political liberty is investigated, and the\r\nrequisite separation of the legislative, judicial, and\r\nadministrative powers is exhibited in the example set forth in the\r\nBritish constitution. But political freedom must include the liberty\r\nof the individual; the rights of the citizen must be respected and\r\nguaranteed; and, as part of the regulation of individual freedom,\r\nthe levying and collection of taxes must be studied.\r\n\r\nFrom this subject Montesquieu passes to his theory, once celebrated,\r\nof the influence of climate and the soil upon the various systems\r\nof legislation, and especially the influence of climate upon the slave\r\nsystem, the virtual servitude of woman, and the growth of political\r\ndespotism. Over against the fatalism of climate and natural\r\nconditions he sets the duty of applying the reason to modify the\r\ninfluences of external nature by wise institutions. National\r\ncharacter, and the manners and customs which are its direct expression,\r\nif they cannot be altered by laws, must be respected, and something\r\neven of direction or regulation may be attained. Laws in relation\r\nto commerce, to money, to population, to religion, are dealt with\r\nin successive books.\r\n\r\nThe duty of religious toleration is urged from the point of view of\r\na statesman, while the discussions of theology are declined. Very\r\nnoteworthy is the humble remonstrance to the inquisitors of Spain\r\nand Portugal ascribed to a Jew of eighteen, who is supposed to have\r\nperished in the last _auto-da-fe_. The facts of the civil order are\r\nnot to be judged by the laws of the religious order, any more than\r\nthe facts of the religious order are to be judged by civil laws. Here\r\nthe great treatise might have closed, but Montesquieu adds what may\r\nbe styled an historical appendix in his study of the origin and\r\ndevelopment of feudal laws. At a time when antiquity was little\r\nregarded, he was an ardent lover of antiquity; at a time when mediaeval\r\nhistory was ignored, he was a student of the forgotten centuries.\r\n\r\nSuch in outline is the great work which in large measure modified\r\nthe course of eighteenth-century thought. Many of its views have been\r\nsuperseded; its collections of facts are not critically dealt with;\r\nits ideas often succeed each other without logical sequence; but\r\nMontesquieu may be said to have created a method, if not a science;\r\nhe brought the study of jurisprudence and politics, in the widest\r\nsense, into literature, laicising and popularising the whole\r\nsubject; he directed history to the investigation of causes; he led\r\nmen to feel the greatness of the social institution; and, while\r\nretiring from view behind his work, he could not but exhibit, for\r\nhis own day and for ours, the spectacle of a great mind operating\r\nover a vast field in the interests of truth, the spectacle of a great\r\nnature that loved the light, hating despotism, but fearing revolution,\r\nsane, temperate, wisely benevolent. In years tyrannised over by\r\nabstract ideas, his work remained to plead for the concrete and the\r\nhistorical; among men devoted to the absolute in theory and the\r\nextreme in practice, it remained to justify the relative, to demand\r\na consideration of circumstances and conditions, to teach men how\r\nlarge a field of reform lay within the bounds of moderation and good\r\nsense.\r\n\r\nThe _Esprit des Lois_ was denounced by Jansenists and Jesuits; it\r\nwas placed in the Index, but in less than two years twenty-two editions\r\nhad appeared, and it was translated into many languages. The author\r\njustified it brilliantly in his _Defense_ of 1750. His later writings\r\nare of small importance. With failing eyesight in his declining years,\r\nhe could enjoy the society of friends and the illumination of his\r\ngreat fame. He died tranquilly (1755) at the age of sixty-six, in\r\nthe spirit of a Christian Stoic.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe life of society was studied by Montesquieu; the inward life of\r\nthe heart was studied by a young moralist, whose premature loss was\r\nlamented with tender passion by Voltaire.\r\n\r\nLuc de Clapiers, Marquis de VAUVENARGUES, though neither a thinker\r\nnor a writer of the highest order, attaches us by the beauty of his\r\ncharacter as seen through his half-finished work, more than any other\r\nauthor of the earlier part of the eighteenth century. He was born\r\n(1715) at Aix, in Provence, received a scanty education, served in\r\nthe army during more than ten years, retired with broken health and\r\nfound no other employment, lived on modest resources, enjoyed the\r\nacquaintance of the Marquis de Mirabeau and the friendship and high\r\nesteem of Voltaire, and died in 1747, at the early age of thirty-two.\r\nHis knowledge of literature hardly extended beyond that of his French\r\npredecessors of the seventeenth century. The chief influences that\r\nreached him came from Pascal, Bossuet, and Fenelon. His learning was\r\nderived from action, from the observation of men, and from\r\nacquaintance with his own heart.\r\n\r\nThe writings of Vauvenargues are the fragmentary _Introduction a la\r\nConnaissance de l'Esprit Humain_, followed by _Reflexions et\r\nMaximes_ (1746), and a few short pieces of posthumous publication.\r\nHe is a moralist, who studies those elements of character which tend\r\nto action, and turns away from metaphysical speculations. His early\r\nfaith in Christianity insensibly declined and disappeared, but his\r\nspirit remained religious; he believed in God and immortality, and\r\nhe never became a militant philosopher. He thought generously of human\r\nnature, but without extravagant optimism. The reason, acting alone,\r\nhe distrusted; he found the source of our highest convictions and\r\nour noblest practice in the emotions, in the heart, in the obscure\r\ndepths of character and of nature. Here, indeed, is Vauvenargues'\r\noriginality. In an age of ill living, he conceived a worthy ideal\r\nof conduct; in an age tending towards an exaggerated homage to reason,\r\nhe honoured the passions: \"Great thoughts come from the heart\"; \"We\r\nowe, perhaps, to the passions the greatest gains of the intellect\";\r\n\"The passions have taught men reason.\"\r\n\r\nVauvenargues, with none of the violences of Rousseau's temperament,\r\nnone of the excess of his sensibility, by virtue of his recognition\r\nof the potency of nature, of the heart, may be called a precursor\r\nof Rousseau. Into his literary criticism he carries the same\r\ntendencies: it is far from judicial criticism; its merit is that it\r\nis personal and touched with emotion. His total work seems but a\r\nfragment, yet his life had a certain completeness; he knew how to\r\nact, to think, to feel, and after great sufferings, borne with\r\nserenity, he knew how to die.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe movement of Voltaire's mind went with that of the general mind\r\nof France. During the first half of the century he was primarily a\r\nman of letters; from about 1750 onwards he was the aggressive\r\nphilosopher, the social reformer, using letters as the vehicle of\r\nmilitant ideas.\r\n\r\nBorn in Paris in 1694, the son of a notary of good family,\r\nFRANCOIS-MARIE AROUET, who assumed the name VOLTAIRE (probably an\r\nanagram formed from the letters of _Arouet l.j._, that is _le jeune_),\r\nwas educated by the Jesuits, and became a precocious versifier of\r\nlittle pieces in the taste of the time. At an early age he was\r\nintroduced to the company of the wits and fine gentlemen who formed\r\nthe sceptical and licentious Society of the Temple. Old Arouet\r\ndespaired of his son, who was eager for pleasure, and a reluctant\r\nstudent of the law. A short service in Holland, in the household of\r\nthe French ambassador, produced no better result than a fruitless\r\nlove-intrigue.\r\n\r\nAgain in Paris, where he ill endured the tedium of an attorney's office,\r\nVoltaire haunted the theatres and the _salons_, wrote light verse\r\nand indecorous tales, planned his tragedy _OEdipe_, and, inspired\r\nby old M. de Caumartin's enthusiasm for Henri IV., conceived the idea\r\nof his _Henriade_. Suspected of having written defamatory verses\r\nagainst the Regent, he was banished from the capital, and when\r\nreadmitted was for eleven months, on the suspicion of more atrocious\r\nlibels, a prisoner in the Bastille. Here he composed--according to\r\nhis own declaration, in sleep--the second canto of the _Henriade_,\r\nand completed his _OEdipe_, which was presented with success before\r\nthe close of 1718. The prisoner of the Bastille became the favourite\r\nof society, and repaid his aristocratic hosts by the brilliant sallies\r\nof his conversation.\r\n\r\nA second tragedy, _Artemire_, afterwards recast as _Mariamne_, was\r\nill received in its earlier form. Court pensions, the death of his\r\nfather, and lucky financial speculations brought Voltaire\r\nindependence. He travelled in 1722 to Holland, met Jean-Baptiste\r\nRousseau on the way, and read aloud for his new acquaintance _Le Pour\r\net le Contre_, a poem of faith and unfaith--faith in Deism, disbelief\r\nin Christianity. The meeting terminated with untimely wit at\r\nRousseau's expense and mutual hostility. Unable to obtain the\r\napprobation for printing his epic, afterwards named _La Henriade_,\r\nVoltaire arranged for a secret impression, under the title _La Ligue_,\r\nat Rouen (1723), whence many copies were smuggled into Paris. The\r\nyoung Queen, Marie Lecszinska, before whom his _Mariamne_ and the\r\ncomedy _L'Indiscret_ were presented, favoured Voltaire. His\r\nprospects were bright, when sudden disaster fell. A quarrel in the\r\ntheatre with the Chevalier de Rohan, followed by personal violence\r\nat the hands of the Chevalier's bullies, ended for Voltaire, not with\r\nthe justice which he demanded, but with his own lodgment in the\r\nBastille. When released, with orders to quit Paris, he thought of\r\nhis acquaintance and admirer Bolingbroke, and lost no time in taking\r\nrefuge on English soil.\r\n\r\nVoltaire's residence in England extended over three years (1726-29).\r\nBolingbroke, Peterborough, Chesterfield, Pope, Swift, Gay, Thomson,\r\nYoung, Samuel Clarke were among his acquaintances. He discovered the\r\ngenius of that semi-barbarian Shakespeare, but found the only\r\nreasonable English tragedy in Addison's \"Cato.\" He admired the epic\r\npower of Milton, and scorned Milton's allegory of Sin and Death. He\r\nfound a master of philosophy in Locke. He effected a partial entrance\r\ninto the scientific system of Newton. He read with zeal the writings\r\nof those pupils of Bayle, the English Deists. He honoured English\r\nfreedom and the spirit of religious toleration. In 1728 the _Henriade_\r\nwas published by subscription in London, and brought the author\r\nprodigious praise and not a little pelf. He collected material for\r\nhis _Histoire de Charles XII._, and, observing English life and\r\nmanners, prepared the _Lettres Philosophiques_, which were to make\r\nthe mind of England favourably known to his countrymen.\r\n\r\n_Charles XII._, like _La Ligue_, was printed at Rouen, and smuggled\r\ninto Paris. The tragedies _Brutus_ and _Eriphyle_, both of which show\r\nthe influence of the English drama, were coldly received. Voltaire\r\nrose from his fall, and produced _Zaire_ (1732), a kind of\r\neighteenth-century French \"Othello,\" which proved a triumph; it was\r\nheld that Corneille and Racine had been surpassed. In 1733 a little\r\nwork of mingled verse and prose, the _Temple du Gout_, in which recent\r\nand contemporary writers were criticised, gratified the self-esteem\r\nof some, and wounded the vanity of a larger number of his\r\nfellow-authors. The _Lettres Philosophiques sur les Anglais_, which\r\nfollowed, were condemned by the Parliament to be burnt by the public\r\nexecutioner. With other audacities of his pen, the storm increased.\r\nVoltaire took shelter (1734) in Champagne, at Cirey, the chateau of\r\nMadame du Chatelet.\r\n\r\nVoltaire was forty years of age; Madame, a woman of intellect and\r\nvaried culture, was twelve years younger. During fifteen years, when\r\nhe was not wandering abroad, Cirey was the home of Voltaire, and Madame\r\ndu Chatelet his sympathetic, if sometimes his exacting companion.\r\nTo this period belong the dramas _Alzire_, _Zulime_, _L'Enfant\r\nProdigue_, _Mahomet_, _Merope_, _Nanine_. The divine Emilie was\r\ndevoted to science, and Voltaire interpreted the Newtonian\r\nphilosophy to France or discussed questions of physics. Many\r\nadmirable pieces of verse--ethical essays in the manner of Pope,\r\nlighter poems of occasion, _Le Mondain_, which contrasts the golden\r\nage of simplicity with the much more agreeable age of luxury, and\r\nmany besides--were written. Progress was made with the shameless\r\nburlesque on Joan of Arc, _La Pucelle_. In _Zadig_ Voltaire gave the\r\nfirst example of his sparkling tales in prose. Serious historical\r\nlabours occupied him--afterwards to be published--the _Siecle de\r\nLouis XIV._ and the great _Essai sur les Moeurs_. In 1746, with the\r\nsupport of Madame de Pompadour, he entered the French Academy. The\r\ndeath of Madame du Chatelet, in 1749, was a cruel blow to Voltaire.\r\nHe endeavoured in Paris to find consolation in dramatic efforts,\r\nentering into rivalry with the aged Crebillon.\r\n\r\nAmong Voltaire's correspondents, when he dwelt at Cirey, was the Crown\r\nPrince of Prussia, a royal _philosophe_ and aspirant French poet.\r\nRoyal flatteries were not more grateful to Voltaire than philosophic\r\nand literary flatteries were to Frederick. Personal acquaintance\r\nfollowed; but Frederick would not receive Madame du Chatelet, and\r\nVoltaire would not desert his companion. Now when Madame was dead,\r\nwhen the Pompadour ceased from her favours to the poet, when Louis\r\nturned his back in response to a compliment, Frederick was to secure\r\nhis philosopher. In July 1750 Voltaire was installed at Berlin. For\r\na time that city was \"the paradise of _philosophes_.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Siecle de Louis XIV._ was published next year. Voltaire's\r\ninsatiable cupidity, his tricks, his tempers, his vindictiveness,\r\nshown in the _Diatribe du Docteur Akakia_ (an embittered attack on\r\nMaupertuis), alienated the King; when \"the orange\" of Voltaire's\r\ngenius \"was sucked\" he would \"throw away the rind.\" With unwilling\r\ndelays, and the humiliation of an arrest at Frankfort, Voltaire\r\nescaped from the territory of the royal \"Solomon\" (1753), and\r\nattracted to Switzerland by its spirit of toleration, found himself\r\nin 1755 tenant of the chateau which he named Les Delices, near Geneva,\r\nhis \"summer palace,\" and that of Monrion, his \"winter palace,\" in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Lausanne. His pen was busy: the tragedy\r\n_L'Orphelin de la Chine_, tales, fugitive verses, the poem on the\r\nearthquake at Lisbon, with its doubtful assertion of Providence as\r\na slender counterpoise to the certainty of innumerable evils in the\r\nworld, pursued one another in varied succession. Still keeping in\r\nhis hands Les Delices, he purchased in 1758 the chateau and demesne\r\nof Ferney on French soil, and became a kind of prince and patriarch,\r\na territorial lord, wisely benevolent to the little community which\r\nhe made to flourish around him, and at the same time the intellectual\r\npotentate of Europe.\r\n\r\nNever had his brain been more alert and indefatigable. The years from\r\n1760 to 1778 were years of incessant activity. Tragedy, comedy, opera,\r\nepistles, satires, tales in verse, _La Pucelle_,[1] _Le Pauvre\r\nDiable_ (admirable in its malignity), literary criticism, a\r\ncommentary on Corneille (published for the benefit of the great\r\ndramatist's grandniece), brilliant tales in prose, the _Essai sur\r\nles Moeurs et l'Esprit des Nations_, the _Histoire de l'Empire de\r\nRussie sous Pierre le Grand_, with other voluminous historical works,\r\ninnumerable writings in philosophy, in religious polemics, including\r\nmany articles of the _Dictionnaire Philosophique_, in politics, in\r\njurisprudence, a vast correspondence which extended his influence\r\nover the whole of Europe--these are but a part of the achievement\r\nof a sexagenarian progressing to become an octogenarian.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: First authorised edition, 1762; surreptitiously printed,\r\n1755.]\r\n\r\nHis work was before all else a warfare against intolerance and in\r\nfavour of free thought. The grand enemy of intellectual liberty\r\nVoltaire saw in the superstition of the Church; his word of command\r\nwas short and uncompromising--_Ecrasez l'Infame_. Jean Calas, a\r\nProtestant of Toulouse, falsely accused of the murder of his son,\r\nwho was alleged to have been converted to the Roman communion, was\r\ntortured and broken on the wheel. Voltaire, with incredible zeal,\r\ntook up the victim's cause, and finally established the dead man's\r\ninnocence. Sirven, a Protestant, declared guilty of the murder of\r\nhis Roman Catholic daughter, was beggared and banished; Voltaire\r\nsucceeded, after eight years, in effecting the reversal of the\r\nsentence. La Barre was tortured and decapitated for alleged impiety.\r\nVoltaire was not strong enough to overpower the French magistracy\r\nsupported now by the French monarch. He turned to Frederick with a\r\nrequest that he would give shelter to a colony of _philosophes_, who\r\nshould through the printing-press make a united assault upon\r\n_l'Infame_.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of 1778, Voltaire, urged by friends, imprudently\r\nconsented to visit Paris. His journey was like a regal progress; his\r\nreception in the capital was an overwhelming ovation. In March he\r\nwas ailing, but he rose from his bed, was present at a performance\r\nof his _Irene_, and became the hero and the victim of extravagant\r\npopular enthusiasm. In April he eagerly pleaded at the French Academy\r\nfor a new dictionary, and undertook himself to superintend the letter\r\nA. In May he was dangerously ill; on the 26th he had the joy of learning\r\nthat his efforts to vindicate the memory of the unfortunate Count\r\nLally were crowned with success. It was Voltaire's last triumph; four\r\ndays later, unshriven and unhouseled, he expired. Seldom had such\r\na coil of electrical energy been lodged within a human brain. His\r\ndesire for intellectual activity was a consuming passion. His love\r\nof influence, his love of glory were boundless. Subject to spasms\r\nof intensest rage, capable of malignant trickery to gain his ends,\r\njealous, mean, irreverent, mendacious, he had yet a heart open to\r\ncharity and pity, a zeal for human welfare, a loyalty to his ruling\r\nideas, and a saving good sense founded upon his swift and clear\r\nperception of reality.\r\n\r\nVoltaire's mind has been described as \"a chaos of clear ideas.\" It\r\nis easy to point out the inconsistencies of his opinions, yet certain\r\ndominant thoughts can be distinguished amid the chaos. He believed\r\nin a God; the arrangements of the universe require a designer; the\r\nidea of God is a benefit to society--if He did not exist, He must\r\nbe invented. But to suppose that the Deity intervenes in the affairs\r\nof the world is superstition; He rules through general laws--His\r\nexecutive; He is represented in the heart of man by His\r\nviceroy--conscience. The soul is immortal, and God is just; therefore\r\nlet wrong-doers beware. In _L'Histoire de Jenni_ the youthful hero\r\nis perverted by his atheistic associates, and does not fear to murder\r\nhis creditor; he is reconverted to theism, and becomes one of the\r\nbest men in England. As to the evil which darkens the world, we cannot\r\nunderstand it; let us not make it worse by vain perplexities; let\r\nus hope that a future life will right the balance of things; and,\r\nmeanwhile, let us attend to the counsels of moderation and good sense;\r\nlet the narrow bounds of our knowledge at least teach us the lesson\r\nof toleration.\r\n\r\nApplied to history, such ideas lead Voltaire, in striking contrast\r\nwith Bossuet, to ignore the supernatural, to eliminate the\r\nProvidential order, and to seek the explanation of events in human\r\nopinion, in human sentiments, in the influence of great men, even\r\nin the influence of petty accident, the caprice of _sa Majeste le\r\nHasard_. In the epoch of classical antiquity--which Voltaire\r\nunderstood ill--man had advanced from barbarism to a condition of\r\ncomparative well-being and good sense; in the Christian and mediaeval\r\nperiod there was a recoil and retrogression; in modern times has begun\r\na renewed advance. In fixing attention on the _esprit et moeurs_ of\r\nnations--their manners, opinions, institutions, sentiments,\r\nprejudices--Voltaire was original, and rendered most important\r\nservice to the study of history. Although his blindness to the\r\nsignificance of religious phenomena is a grave defect, his historical\r\nscepticism had its uses. As a writer of historical narrative he is\r\nadmirably lucid and rapid; nor should the ease of his narration\r\nconceal the fact that he worked laboriously and carefully among\r\noriginal sources. With his _Charles XII._, his _Pierre le Grand_,\r\nhis _Siecle de Louis XIV._, we may class the _Henriade_ as a piece\r\nof history; its imaginative power is not that of an epic, but it is\r\nan interpretation of a fragment of French history in the light of\r\none generous idea--that of religious toleration.\r\n\r\nFilled with destructive passion against the Church, Voltaire, in\r\naffairs of the State, was a conservative. His ideal for France was\r\nan intelligent despotism. But if a conservative, he was one of a\r\nreforming spirit. He pleaded for freedom in the internal trade of\r\nprovince with province, for legal and administrative uniformity\r\nthroughout the whole country, for a reform of the magistracy, for\r\na milder code of criminal jurisprudence, for attention to public\r\nhygiene. His programme was not ambitious, but it was reasonable, and\r\nhis efforts for the general welfare have been justified by time.\r\n\r\nAs a literary critic he was again conservative. He belonged to the\r\nclassical school, and to its least liberal section. He regarded\r\nliterary forms as imposed from without on the content of poetry, not\r\nas growing from within; passion and imagination he would reduce to\r\nthe strict bounds of uninspired good sense; he placed Virgil above\r\nHomer, and preferred French tragedy to that of ancient Greece; from\r\nhis involuntary admiration of Shakespeare he recoiled in alarm; if\r\nhe admired Corneille, it was with many reservations. Yet his taste\r\nwas less narrow than that of some of his contemporaries; he had a\r\ntrue feeling for the genius of the French language; he possessed,\r\nafter the manner of his nation and his time, _le grand gout_; he\r\nhonoured Boileau; he exalted Racine in the highest degree; and, to\r\nthe praise of his discernment, it may be said that he discovered\r\n_Athalie_.\r\n\r\nThe spectacular effects of _Athalie_ impressed Voltaire's\r\nimagination. In his own tragedies, while continuing the\r\nseventeenth-century tradition, he desired to exhibit more striking\r\nsituations, to develop more rapid action, to enhance the dramatic\r\nspectacle, to add local colour. His style and speech in the theatre\r\nhave the conventional monotonous pomp, the conventional monotonous\r\ngrace, without poetic charm, imaginative vision, or those flashes\r\nwhich spring from passionate genius. When, as was frequently the case,\r\nhe wrote for the stage to advocate the cause of an idea, to preach\r\ntolerance or pity, he attained a certain height of eloquence. Whatever\r\nsensibility there was in Voltaire's heart may be discovered in _Zaire_.\r\n_Merope_ has the distinction of being a tragedy from which the passion\r\nof love is absent; its interest rests wholly on maternal affection.\r\n_Tancrede_ is remarkable as an eighteenth-century treatment of the\r\nchivalric life and spirit. The Christian temper of tolerance and\r\nhumanity is honoured in _Alzire_.\r\n\r\nVoltaire's incomparable gift of satirical wit did not make him a\r\nwriter of high comedy: he could be grotesque without lightness or\r\nbrightness. But when a sentimental element mingles with the comic,\r\nand almost obscures it, as in _Nanine_ (a dramatised tale derived\r\nfrom Richardson's _Pamela_), the verse acquires a grace, and certain\r\nscenes an amiable charm. _Nanine_, indeed, though in dramatic form,\r\nlies close to those tales in verse in which Voltaire mingled happily\r\nhis wisdom and his wit. \"The philosophy of Horace in the language\r\nof La Fontaine, this,\" writes a critic, \"is what we find from time\r\nto time in Voltaire.\" In his lighter verses of occasion, epigram,\r\ncompliment, light mockery, half-playful, half-serious sentiment, he\r\nis often exquisite.\r\n\r\nNo part of Voltaire's work has suffered so little at the hands of\r\ntime as his tales in prose. In his contributions to the satire of\r\nhuman-kind he learned something from Rabelais, something from Swift.\r\nIt is the satire of good sense impatient against folly, and armed\r\nwith the darts of wit. Voltaire does not esteem highly the wisdom\r\nof human creatures: they pretend to knowledge beyond their powers;\r\nthey kill one another for an hypothesis; they find ingenious reasons\r\nfor indulging their base or petty passions; their lives are under\r\nthe rule of _sa Majeste le Hasard_. But let us not rage in Timon's\r\nmanner against the human race; if the world is not the best of all\r\npossible worlds, it is not wholly evil. Let us be content to mock\r\nat the absurdity of the universe, and at the diverting, if irritating,\r\nfollies of its inhabitants. Above all, let us find support in work,\r\neven though we do not see to what it tends; \"Il faut cultiver notre\r\njardin\"--such is Voltaire's word, and the final word of Candide. With\r\nlight yet effective irony, Voltaire preaches the lesson of good sense.\r\nWhen bitter, he is still gay; his sad little philosophy of existence\r\nis uttered with an accent of mirth; his art in satirical narrative\r\nis perfect; he is not resigned; he is not enraged; he is indignant,\r\nbut at the same time he smiles; there is always the last resource\r\nof blindly cultivating our garden.\r\n\r\nIn Voltaire's myriad-minded correspondence the whole man may be\r\nfound--his fire, his sense, his universal curiosity, his wit, his\r\nmalignity, his goodness, his Protean versatility, his ruling ideas;\r\nand one may say that the whole of eighteenth-century Europe presses\r\ninto the pages. He is not only the man of letters, the student of\r\nscience, the philosopher; he is equally interested in politics, in\r\nsocial reform, in industry, in agriculture, in political economy,\r\nin philology, and, together with these, in the thousand incidents\r\nof private life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\nDIDEROT AND THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA--PHILOSOPHERS, ECONOMISTS,\r\nCRITICS--BUFFON\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\"When I recall Diderot,\" wrote his friend Meister, \"the immense\r\nvariety of his ideas, the amazing multiplicity of his knowledge, the\r\nrapid flight, the warmth, the impetuous tumult of his imagination,\r\nall the charm and all the disorder of his conversation, I venture\r\nto liken his character to Nature herself, exactly as he used to\r\nconceive her--rich, fertile, abounding in germs of every sort ...\r\nwithout any dominating principle, without a master, and without a\r\nGod.\" No image more suitable could be found; and his works resemble\r\nthe man, in their richness, their fertility, their variety, and their\r\ndisorder. A great writer we can hardly call him, for he has left no\r\nbody of coherent thought, no piece of finished art; but he was the\r\ngreatest of literary improvisators.\r\n\r\nDENIS DIDEROT, son of a worthy cutler of Langres, was born in 1713.\r\nEducated by the Jesuits, he turned away from the regular professions,\r\nand supported himself and his ill-chosen wife by hack-work for the\r\nParis booksellers--translations, philosophical essays directed\r\nagainst revealed religion, stories written to suit the appetite for\r\ngarbage. From deism he advanced to atheism. Arguing in favour of the\r\nrelativity of human knowledge in his _Lettre sur les Aveugles_ (1749),\r\nhe puts his plea for atheism into the lips of an English man of science,\r\nbut the device did not save him from an imprisonment of three months.\r\n\r\nIn 1745 the booksellers, contemplating a translation of the English\r\n\"Cyclopaedia\" of Chambers, applied to Diderot for assistance. He\r\nreadily undertook the task, but could not be satisfied with a mere\r\ntranslation. In a Prospectus (1750) he indicated the design of the\r\n\"Encyclopaedia\" as he conceived it: the order and connection of the\r\nvarious branches of knowledge should be set forth, and in dictionary\r\nform the several sciences, liberal arts, and mechanical arts should\r\nbe dealt with by experts. The homage which he rendered to science\r\nexpressed the mind of his time; in the honour paid to mechanical toil\r\nand industry he was in advance of his age, and may be called an\r\norganiser of modern democracy. At his request JEAN LE ROND D'ALEMBERT\r\n(1717-83) undertook the direction of the mathematical articles, and\r\nwrote the _Discours Preliminaire_, which classified the departments\r\nof human knowledge on the basis of Bacon's conceptions, and gave a\r\nsurvey of intellectual progress. It was welcomed with warm applause.\r\nThe aid of Voltaire, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Buffon, Turgot, Quesnay,\r\nand a host of less illustrious writers was secured; but the vast\r\nenterprise excited the alarms of the ecclesiastical party; the\r\nJesuits were active in rivalry and opposition; Rousseau deserted and\r\nbecame an enemy; D'Alembert, timid, and a lover of peace, withdrew.\r\nIn 1759 the privilege of publication was revoked, but the Government\r\ndid not enforce its own decree. Through all difficulties and dangers\r\nDiderot held his ground. One day he wrote a fragment of the history\r\nof philosophy; the next he was in a workshop examining the\r\nconstruction of some machine: nothing was too great or too small for\r\nhis audacity or his patience. To achieve the work, tact was needed\r\nas well as courage; at times he condescended to disguise his real\r\nopinions, striving to weather the storm by yielding to it. In 1765\r\nhis gigantic labours were substantially accomplished, though the\r\nlast plates of the _Encyclopedie_ were not issued until 1772. When\r\nall was finished, the scientific movement of the century was\r\nmethodised and popularised; a barrier against the invasion of the\r\npast was erected; the rationalist philosophy, with all its truths\r\nand all its errors, its knowledge and its ignorance, had obtained\r\nits _Summa_.\r\n\r\nBut, besides this co-operative work, Diderot did much, and in many\r\ndirections, single-handed, flinging out his thoughts with ardent\r\nhaste, and often leaving what he had written to the mercies of chance;\r\na prodigal sower of good and evil seed. Several of his most remarkable\r\npieces came to light, as it were, by accident, and long after his\r\ndeath. His novel _La Religieuse_--influenced to some extent by\r\nRichardson, whom he superstitiously admired--is a repulsive exposure\r\nof conventual life as it appeared to him, and of its moral disorder.\r\n_Jacques le Fataliste_, in which the manner is coarsely imitated from\r\nSterne, a book ill-composed and often malodorous, contains, among\r\nits heterogeneous tales, one celebrated narrative, the _Histoire de\r\nMme. de la Pommeraye_, relating a woman's base revenge on a faithless\r\nlover. If anything of Diderot's can be named a masterpiece, it is\r\ncertainly _Le Neveu de Rameau_, a satire and a character-study of\r\nthe parasite, thrown into the form of dialogue, which he handled with\r\nbrilliant success; it remained unknown until the appearance of a\r\nGerman version (1805), made by Goethe from a manuscript copy.\r\n\r\nIn his _Salons_, Diderot elevated and enlarged the criticism of the\r\npictorial art in France. His eye for colour and for contour was\r\nadmirable; but it is less the technique of paintings that he studies\r\nthan the subjects, the ideas, and the moral significance. Such\r\ncriticism may be condemned as literary rather than artistic; it was,\r\nhowever, new and instructive, and did much to quicken the public taste.\r\nDiderot pleaded for a return to nature in the theatre; for a bourgeois\r\ndrama, domestic tragedy and serious comedy, touched with pathos,\r\nstudied from real life, and inspired by a moral purpose; for the\r\npresentation on the stage of \"conditions\" rather than individual\r\ntypes--that is, of character as modified by social environments and\r\nthe habits which they produce. He maintained that the actor should\r\nrather possess than be possessed by his theme, should be the master\r\nrather than the slave of his sensibility.\r\n\r\nThe examples of dramatic art which Diderot gave in his own plays,\r\nthe _Pere de Famille_ and the _Fils Naturel_, are poor affectations\r\nof a style supposed to be natural, and are patently doctrinaire in\r\ntheir design, laboured developments of a moral thesis. One piece in\r\nwhich he paints himself, _Est-il bon? Est-il mechant?_ and this alone,\r\nfalls little short of being admirable, and yet it fails of true\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nA coherent system of thought cannot be found in Diderot's writings,\r\nbut they are pregnant with ideas. He is deist, pantheist, atheist;\r\nhe is a materialist--one, however, who conceives matter not as inert,\r\nbut quick with force. He is edifying and sincere in his morality;\r\nand presently his morals become the doctrines of an anarchical licence.\r\nAll the ideas of his age struggle within him, and are never reduced\r\nto unity or harmony; light is never separate in his nature from heat,\r\nand light and warmth together give rise to thoughts which are\r\nsometimes the anticipations of scientific genius; he almost leaps\r\nforward to some of the conclusions of Darwin. His great powers and\r\nhis incessant energy were not directed to worldly prosperity. Diderot\r\nwas never rich. The Empress Catherine of Russia magnificently\r\npurchased his library, and entrusted him with the books, as her\r\nlibrarian, providing a salary which to him was wealth. He travelled\r\nto St. Petersburg to thank her in person for her generous and delicate\r\ngift. But her imperial generosity was not greater than his own; he\r\nwas always ready to lavish the treasures of his knowledge and thought\r\nin the service of others; no small fragment of his work was a free\r\ngift to his friends, and passed under their name; Holbach and Raynal\r\nwere among his debtors.\r\n\r\nHis correspondence presents a vivid image of the man and of the group\r\nof philosophers to which he belonged; the letters addressed to Mlle.\r\nVolland, to whom he was devotedly attached during many years, are\r\nfrank betrayals of his character and his life. Her loss saddened his\r\nlast days, but the days of sorrow were few. In July 1784, Diderot\r\ndied. His reputation and influence were from time to time enhanced\r\nby posthumous publications. Other writers of his century impressed\r\ntheir own personalities more distinctly and powerfully upon society;\r\nno other writer mingled his genius so completely with external things,\r\nor responded so fully and variously to the stimulus of the spirit\r\nof his age.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe French philosophical movement--the \"Illumination\"--of the\r\neighteenth century, proceeds in part from the empiricism of Locke,\r\nin part from the remarkable development of physical and natural\r\nscience; it incorporated the conclusions of English deism, and\r\nadvanced from deism to atheism. An intellectual centre for the\r\nmovement was provided by the _Encyclopedie_; a social centre was found\r\nin Parisian _salons_. It was sustained and invigorated by the passion\r\nfor freedom and for justice asserting itself against the despotism\r\nand abuses of government and against the oppressions and abuses of\r\nthe Church. The opposing forces were feeble, incompetent,\r\ndisorganised. The methods of government were, in truth,\r\nindefensible; religion had surrendered dogma, and lost the austerity\r\nof morals; within the citadel of the Church were many professed and\r\nmany secret allies of the philosophers.\r\n\r\nWhile in England an apologetic literature arose, profound in thought\r\nand adequate in learning, in France no sustained resistance was\r\noffered to the inroad of free thought. Episcopal fulminations rolled\r\nlike stage thunder; the Bastille and Vincennes were holiday retreats\r\nfor fatigued combatants; imprisonment was tempered with cajoleries;\r\nthe censors of the press connived with their victims. The Chancellor\r\nD'AGUESSEAU (1668-1751), an estimable magistrate, a dignified orator,\r\nmaintained the old seriousness of life and morals, and received the\r\nreward of exile. The good ROLLIN (1661-1741) dictated lessons to youth\r\ndrawn from antiquity and Christianity, narrated ancient history, and\r\ndiscoursed admirably on a plan of studies with a view to form the\r\nheart and mind; an amiable Christian Nestor, he was not a man-at-arms.\r\nThe Abbe Guenee replied to Voltaire with judgment, wit, and erudition,\r\nin his _Lettres de quelques Juifs_ (1769), but it was a single victory\r\nin a campaign of many battles. The satire of Gilbert, _Le Dix-huitieme\r\nSiecle_, is rudely vigorous; but Gilbert was only an angry youth,\r\ndisappointed of his fame. Freron, the \"Wasp\" (_frelon_) of Voltaire's\r\n_L'Ecossaise_, might sting in his _Annee Litteraire_, but there were\r\nsharper stings in satire and epigram which he must endure. Palissot\r\nmight amuse the theatrical spectators of 1760 with his ridiculous\r\nphilosophers; the _Philosophes_ was taken smilingly by Voltaire, and\r\nwas sufficiently answered by Morellet's pamphlet and the\r\n_bouts-rimes_ of Marmontel or Piron. The _Voltairomanie_ of\r\nDesfontaines is only the outbreak of resentment of the accomplished\r\nand disreputable Abbe against a benefactor whose offence was to have\r\nsaved him from the galleys.\r\n\r\nThe sensationalist philosophy is inaugurated by JULIEN OFFRAY DE LA\r\nMETTRIE (1709-51) rather than by Condillac. A physician, making\r\nobservations on his own case during an attack of fever, he arrived\r\nat the conclusion that thought is but a result of the mechanism of\r\nthe body. Man is a machine more ingeniously organised than the brute.\r\nAll ideas have their origin in sensation. As for morals, they are\r\nnot absolute, but relative to society and the State. As for God,\r\nperhaps He exists, but why should we worship this existence more than\r\nany other? The law of our being is to seek happiness; the law of society\r\nis that we should not interfere with the happiness of others. The\r\npleasure of the senses is not the only pleasure, but it has the\r\ndistinction of being universal to our species.\r\n\r\nLa Mettrie, while opposing the spiritualism of Descartes, is more\r\nclosely connected with that great thinker, through his doctrine that\r\nbrutes are but machines, than with Locke. It is from Locke--though\r\nfrom Locke mutilated--that ETIENNE BONNOT DE CONDILLAC (1715-80)\r\nproceeds. All ideas are sensations, but sensations transformed.\r\nImagine a marble statue endowed successively with the several human\r\nsenses; it will be seen how perceptions, consciousness, memory, ideas,\r\ncomparison, judgment, association, abstraction, pleasure, desire\r\nare developed. The _ego_ is but the bundle of sensations experienced\r\nor transformed and held in recollection. Yet the unity of the _ego_\r\nseems to argue that it is not composed of material particles.\r\nCondillac's doctrine is sensationalist, but not materialistic.\r\nCondillac's disciple, the physician Cabanis (1757-1808), proceeded\r\nto investigate the nature of sensibility itself, and to develop the\r\nphysiological method of psychology. The unnecessary soul which\r\nCondillac preserved was suppressed by Destutt de Tracy (1754-1836);\r\nhis ideology was no more than a province of zoology.\r\n\r\nThe morals of the sensationalist school were expressed by\r\nCLAUDE-ADRIEN HELVETIUS (1715-71), a worthy and benevolent\r\nfarmer-general. The motive of all our actions is self-love, that\r\ntendency which leads us to seek for pleasure and avoid pain; but,\r\nby education and legislation, self-love can be guided and trained\r\nso that it shall harmonise with the public good. It remained for a\r\nGerman acclimatised to Paris to compile the full manifesto of\r\natheistic materialism. At Holbach's hospitable table the\r\nphilosophers met, and the air was charged with ideas. To condense\r\nthese into a system was Holbach's task. Diderot, Lagrange, Naigeon\r\nmay have lent their assistance, but PAUL-HENRY THIRY, BARON D'HOLBACH\r\n(1723-89) must be regarded as substantially the author of the _Systeme\r\nde la Nature_ (1770), which the title-page prudently attributed to\r\nthe deceased Mirabaud. What do we desire but that men should be happy,\r\njust, benevolent? That they may become so, it is necessary to deliver\r\nthem from those errors on which political and spiritual despotism\r\nis founded, from the chains of tyrants and the chimeras of priests,\r\nand to lead them back from illusions to nature, of which man is a\r\npart. We find everywhere matter and motion, a chain of material causes\r\nand effects, nor can we find aught beside these. An ever-circulating\r\nsystem of motions connects inorganic and organic nature, fire and\r\nair and plant and animal; free-will is as much excluded as God and\r\nHis miraculous providence. The soul is nothing but the brain receiving\r\nand transmitting motions; morals form a department of physiology.\r\nReligions and governments, as they exist, are based on error, and\r\ndrive men into crime. But though Holbach \"accommodated atheism,\" as\r\nGrimm puts it, \"to chambermaids and hairdressers,\" he would not hurry\r\nforward a revolution. All will come in good time; in some happier\r\nday Nature and her daughters Virtue, Reason, and Truth will alone\r\nreceive the adoration of mankind.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Swiss naturalist Charles Bonnet (1720-93)\r\nendeavoured to reconcile his sensationalism with a religious faith\r\nand a private interpretation of Christianity.]\r\n\r\nAmong the friends of Holbach and Helvetius was C.-F. de Chasseboeuf,\r\nCount de VOLNEY (1757-1820), who modified and developed the ethics\r\nof Helvetius. An Orientalist by his studies, he travelled in Egypt\r\nand Syria, desiring to investigate the origins of ancient religions,\r\nand reported what he had seen in colourless but exact description.\r\nIn _Les Ruines, ou Meditations sur les Revolutions des Empires_, he\r\nrecalls the past like \"an Arab Ossian,\" monotonous and grandiose,\r\nand expounds the history of humanity with cold and superficial\r\nanalysis clothed in a pomp of words. His faith in human progress,\r\nfounded on nature, reason, and justice, sustained Volney during the\r\nrise and fall of the Girondin party.\r\n\r\nA higher and nobler spirit, who perished in the Revolution, but ceased\r\nnot till his last moment to hope and labour for the good of men, was\r\nJ.-A.-N. de Caritat, Marquis de CONDORCET (1743-94). Illustrious in\r\nmathematical science, he was interested by Turgot in political\r\neconomy, and took a part in the polemics of theology. While lying\r\nconcealed from the emissaries of Robespierre he wrote his _Esquisse\r\nd'un Tableau Historique des Progres de l'Esprit Humain_. It is a\r\nphilosophy of the past, and almost a hymn in honour of human\r\nperfectibility. The man-statue of Condillac, receiving, retaining,\r\ndistinguishing, and combining sensations, has gradually developed,\r\nthrough nine successive epochs, from that of the hunter and fisher\r\nto the citizen of 1789, who comprehends the physical universe with\r\nNewton, human nature with Locke and Condillac, and society with Turgot\r\nand Rousseau. In the vision of the future, with its progress in\r\nknowledge and in morals, its individual and social improvement, its\r\nlessening inequalities between nations and classes, the philosopher\r\nfinds his consolation for all the calamities of the present age.\r\nCondorcet died in prison, poisoned, it is believed, by his own hand.\r\n\r\nThe economists, or, as Dupont de Nemours named them, the physiocrats,\r\nformed a not unimportant wing of the philosophic phalanx, now in\r\nharmony with the Encyclopaedic party, now in hostility. The sense\r\nof the misery of France was present to many minds in the opening of\r\nthe century, and with the death of Louis XIV. came illusive hopes\r\nof amelioration. The Abbe de Saint-Pierre (1658-1743), filled with\r\nardent zeal for human happiness, condemned the government of the\r\ndeparted Grand Monarch, and dreamed of a perpetual peace; among his\r\ndreams arose projects for the improvement of society which were\r\njustified by time. Boisguillebert, and Vauban, marshal of France and\r\nmilitary engineer, were no visionary spirits; they pleaded for a\r\nserious consideration of the general welfare, and especially the\r\nwelfare of the agricultural class, the wealth-producers of the\r\ncommunity. To violate economic laws, Boisguillebert declared, is to\r\nviolate nature; let governments restrain their meddling, and permit\r\nnatural forces to operate with freedom.\r\n\r\nSuch was the doctrine of the physiocratic school, of which FRANCOIS\r\nQUESNAY (1694-1774) was the chief. Let human institutions conform\r\nto nature; enlarge the bounds of freedom; give play to the spirit\r\nof individualism; diminish the interference of government--\"laissez\r\nfaire, laissez passer.\"[2] Agriculture is productive, let its\r\nburdens be alleviated; manufactures are useful but \"sterile\": honour,\r\ntherefore, above all, to the tiller of the fields, who hugs nature\r\nclose, and who enriches humankind! The elder Mirabeau--\"ami des\r\nhommes\"--who had anticipated Quesnay in some of his views, and himself\r\nhad learnt from Cantillon, met Quesnay in 1757, and thenceforth\r\nsubordinated his own fiery spirit, as far as that was possible, to\r\nthe spirit of the master. From the physiocrats--Gournay and\r\nQuesnay--the noble-minded and illustrious TURGOT (1727-81) derived\r\nmany of those ideas of reform which he endeavoured to put into action\r\nwhen intendant of Limoges, and later, when Minister of Finance. By\r\nhis _Reflexions sur la Formation et la Distribution des Richesses_,\r\nTurgot prepared the way for Adam Smith.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: This phrase had been used by Boisguillebert and by the\r\nMarquis d'Argenson before Gournay made it a power. On D'Argenson\r\n(1694-1757), whose _Considerations sur le Gouvernement de la France_\r\nwere not published until 1764, see the study by Mr. Arthur Ogle\r\n(1893).]\r\n\r\nIn 1770 the Abbe Galiani, as alert of brain as he was diminutive of\r\nstature, attacked the physiocratic doctrines in his _Dialogues sur\r\nle Commerce des Bles_, which Plato and Moliere--so Voltaire\r\npronounced--had combined to write. The refutation of the _Dialogues_\r\nby Morellet was the result of no such brilliant collaboration, and\r\nGaliani, proposed that his own unstatuesque person should be honoured\r\nby a statue above an inscription, declaring that he had wiped out\r\nthe economists, who were sending the nation to sleep. The fame of\r\nhis _Dialogues_ was perhaps in large measure due to the party-spirit\r\nof the Encyclopaedists, animated by a vivacious attack upon the\r\nphysiocrats. The book was applauded, but reached no second edition.\r\n\r\nAn important body of articles on literature was contributed to the\r\n_Encyclopedie_ by JEAN-FRANCOIS MARMONTEL. As early as 1719 a\r\nremarkable study in aesthetics had appeared--the _Reflexions\r\nCritiques sur la Poesie et la Peinture_, by the Abbe Dubos. Art is\r\nconceived as a satisfaction of the craving for vivid sensations and\r\nemotions apart from the painful consequences which commonly attend\r\nthese in actual life. That portion of Dubos' work which treats of\r\n\"physical causes in the progress of art and literature,\" anticipates\r\nthe views of Montesquieu on the influence of climate, and studies\r\nthe action of environment on the products of the imagination. In 1746\r\nCharles Batteux, in his treatise _Les Beaux-Arts reduits a un meme\r\nPrincipe_, defined the end of art as the imitation of nature--not\r\nindeed of reality, but of nature in its actual or possible beauty;\r\nof nature not as it is, but as it may be. The articles of Marmontel,\r\nrevised and collected in the six volumes of his _Elements de\r\nLitterature_ (1787), were full of instruction for his own time,\r\ndelicate and just in observation, as they often were, if not\r\npenetrating or profound. In his earlier _Poetique Francaise_--\"a\r\npetard,\" said Mairan, \"laid at the doors of the Academy to blow them\r\nup if they should not open\"--he had shown himself strangely\r\ndisrespectful towards the fame of Racine, Boileau, and the poet\r\nRousseau.\r\n\r\nThe friend of Marmontel, Antoine-Leonard Thomas (1732-85),\r\nhonourably distinguished by the dignity of his character and conduct,\r\na composer of _Eloges_ on great men, somewhat marred by strain and\r\noratorical emphasis, put his best work into an _Essai sur les Eloges_.\r\nAt a time when Bossuet was esteemed below his great deserts,\r\nThomas--almost alone--recognised his supremacy in eloquence. As the\r\ncentury advanced, and philosophy developed its attack on religion\r\nand governments, the classical tradition in literature not only\r\nremained unshaken, but seemed to gain in authority. The first\r\nlieutenant of Voltaire, his literary \"son,\" LAHARPE (1739-1803)\r\nrepresents the critical temper of the time. In 1786 he began his\r\ncourses of lectures at the Lycee, before a brilliant audience composed\r\nof both sexes. For the first time in France, instruction in literature,\r\nnot trivial and not erudite, but suited to persons of general culture,\r\nwas made an intellectual pleasure. For the first time the history\r\nof literature was treated, in its sequence from Homer to modern times,\r\nas a totality. Laharpe's judgments of his contemporaries were often\r\nmisled by his bitterness of spirit; his mind was not capacious, his\r\nsympathies were not liberal; his knowledge, especially of Greek\r\nletters, was defective. But he knew the great age of Louis XIV., and\r\nhe felt the beauty of its art. No one has written with finer\r\nintelligence of Racine than he in his _Lycee, ou Cours de Litterature_.\r\nAs the Revolution approached he sympathised with its hopes and fears;\r\nthe professor donned the _bonnet rouge_. The storm which burst\r\nsilenced his voice for a time; in 1793 he suffered imprisonment; and\r\nwhen he occupied his chair again, it was a converted Laharpe who\r\ndeclaimed against philosophers, republicans, and atheists, the\r\ntyrants of reason, morals, art and letters.\r\n\r\nThe finest and surest judgment in contemporary literature was that\r\nof a gallicised German--MELCHIOR GRIMM (1723-1807). As Laharpe was\r\nbound in filial loyalty to Voltaire, so Grimm was in fraternal\r\nattachment to the least French of eighteenth-century French\r\nauthors--Diderot. From a basis of character in which there was a\r\nmeasure of Teutonic enthusiasm and romance, his intellect rose clear,\r\nlight, and sure, with no mists of sentiment about it, and no clouds\r\nof fancy. During thirty-seven years, as a kind of private journalist,\r\nhe furnished princely and royal persons of Germany, Russia, Sweden,\r\nPoland, with \"Correspondence,\" which reflected as from a mirror all\r\nthe lights of Paris to the remote North and East. His own philosophy,\r\nhis political views, were cheerless and arid; but he could judge the\r\nwork of others generously as well as severely. No one of his generation\r\nso intelligently appreciated Shakespeare; no one more happily\r\ninterpreted Montaigne. By swift _apercu_, by criticism, by anecdote,\r\nby caustic raillery, or serious record, he makes the intellectual\r\nworld of his day pass before us and expound its meanings. The\r\nRevolution, the dangers of which he divined early, drove him from\r\nParis. In bidding it farewell he wished that he were in his grave.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nBuffon, whose power of wing was great, and who did not love the heat\r\nand dust of combat, soared smoothly above the philosophic strife.\r\nBorn in 1707, at Montbard, in Burgundy, GEORGE-LOUIS LECLERC, created\r\nComte de BUFFON by Louis XV., fortunate in the possession of riches,\r\nhealth, and serenity of heart and brain, lived in his domestic circle,\r\napart from the coteries of Paris, pursuing with dignity and infinite\r\npatience his proper ends. The legend describes him as a pompous\r\nOlympian even in his home; in truth, if he was majestic--like a marshal\r\nof France, as Hume describes him--he was also natural, genial, and\r\nat times gay. His appointment, in 1739, as intendant of the Royal\r\nGarden, now the _Jardin des Plantes_, turned his studies from\r\nmathematical science to natural history.\r\n\r\nThe first volumes of his vast _Histoire Naturelle_ appeared in 1749;\r\naided by Daubenton and others, he was occupied with the succeeding\r\nvolumes during forty years, until death terminated his labours in\r\n1788. The defects of his work are obvious--its want of method, its\r\ndisdain of classification, its abuse of hypotheses, its humanising\r\nof the animal world, its pomp of style. But the progress of science,\r\nwhich lowered the reputation of Buffon, has again re-established his\r\nfame. Not a few of his disdained hypotheses are seen to have been\r\nthe divinations of genius; and if he wrote often in the ornate,\r\nclassical manner, he could also write with a grave simplicity.\r\n\r\nIn his _Discours de Reception_, pronounced before the French Academy\r\nin 1753, he formulated his doctrine of literary style, insisting that\r\nit is, before all else, the manifestation of order in the evolution\r\nof ideas; ideas alone form the basis and inward substance of style.\r\nRejecting merely abstract conceptions as an explanation of natural\r\nphenomena, viewing classifications as no more than a convenience of\r\nthe human intellect, refusing to regard final causes as a subject\r\nof science, he envisaged nature with a tranquil and comprehensive\r\ngaze, and with something of a poet's imagination. He perceived that\r\nthe globe, in its actual condition, is the result of a long series\r\nof changes, and thereby he gave an impulse to sound geological study;\r\nhe expounded the geography of species, and almost divined the theory\r\nof their transformation or variability; he recognised in some degree\r\nthe struggle for existence and the survival of the fittest; he\r\nregarded man as a part of nature, but as its noblest part, capable\r\nof an intellectual and moral progress which is not the mere result\r\nof physical laws.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been Buffon's errors as a thinker, he enlarged the\r\nbounds of literature by annexing the province of natural history as\r\nMontesquieu had annexed that of political science. His vision of the\r\nuniverse was unclouded by passion, and part of its grandeur is derived\r\nfrom this serenity. He studied and speculated with absolute freedom,\r\nprepared to advance from his own ideas to others more in accordance\r\nwith observed phenomena. \"He desired to be,\" writes a critic, \"and\r\nalmost became, a pure intelligence in presence of eternal things.\"\r\nHow could he concern himself with the strifes and passions of a day\r\nto whom the centuries were moments in the vast process of evolving\r\nchange? In Andre Chenier he found a disciple who would fain have been\r\nthe Lucretius of the new system of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\nROUSSEAU--BEAUMARCHAIS--BERNARDIN DE SAINT-PIERRE--ANDRE CHENIER\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nJEAN-JACQUES ROUSSEAU the man is inseparable from Rousseau the\r\nwriter; his works proceed directly from his character and his life.\r\nBorn at Geneva in 1712, he died at Ermenonville in 1778. His childhood\r\nwas followed by years of vagabondage. From 1732, the date of his third\r\nresidence with Madame de Warens, until 1741, though his vagabondage\r\ndid not wholly cease, he was collecting his powers and educating his\r\nmind with studies ardently pursued. During nine subsequent years in\r\nParis, in Venice, and elsewhere, he was working his way towards the\r\nlight; it was the period of his gayer writings, ballet, opera, comedy,\r\nand of the articles on music contributed to the _Encyclopedie_: he\r\nhad not yet begun to preach and prophesy to his age. The great fourth\r\nperiod of his life, from 1749 to 1762, includes all his masterpieces\r\nexcept the _Confessions_. From 1762 until his death, while his temper\r\ngrew darker and his reason was disturbed, Rousseau was occupied with\r\napologetic and autobiographic writings.\r\n\r\nHis mother died in giving birth to Jean-Jacques. His father, a\r\nwatchmaker, filled the child's head with the follies of romances,\r\nwhich they read together, and gave him through Plutarch's Lives a\r\nsense of the exaltations of virtue. The boy's feeling for nature was\r\nquickened and fostered in the garden of the pastor of Bossey. From\r\na notary's office, where he seemed an incapable fool, he passed under\r\nthe harsh rule of an engraver of watches, learning the vices that\r\ngrow from fear. At sixteen he fled, and found protection at Annecy,\r\nunder Madame de Warens, a young and comely lady, recently converted\r\nto the Roman communion, frank, kind, gay, and as devoid of moral\r\nprinciples as any creature in the Natural History. Sent to Turin for\r\ninstruction, Rousseau renounced his Protestant faith, and soon after\r\nfound in the good Abbe Gaime the model in part of his Savoyard vicar.\r\nSome experience of domestic service was followed by a year at Annecy,\r\nduring which Rousseau's talent as a musician was developed. From\r\neighteen to twenty he led a wandering life--\"starved, feasted,\r\ndespaired, was happy.\" Rejoining Madame de Warens at Chambery in 1732,\r\nhe interested himself in music, physics, botany, and was more and\r\nmore drawn towards the study of letters. He methodised his reading\r\n(1738-41), and passionately pursued a liberal system of\r\nself-education, literary, scientific, and philosophical.\r\n\r\nRousseau's relations with his _bonne maman_, Madame de Warens, had\r\nbeen troubled by the latest of her other loves. In 1741 he set off\r\nfor Paris, bearing with him the manuscript of a new system of musical\r\nnotation, which was offered to the Academie des Sciences, and was\r\ndeclared neither new nor useful for instrumentalists. An experiment\r\nin life as secretary to the French Ambassador at Venice closed, after\r\nfourteen months, with his abrupt dismissal. Again in Paris, Rousseau\r\nobtained celebrity by his operas and comedies, was received in the\r\n_salons_, and associated joyously with Diderot, Marmontel, and Grimm.\r\nHe arranged his domestic life by taking an illiterate and vulgar\r\ndrudge, Therese Le Vasseur, for his companion; their children were\r\nabandoned to the care of the Foundling Hospital.\r\n\r\nIn 1749 Diderot was a prisoner at Vincennes. Rousseau, on the road\r\nto visit his friend, read in the _Mercure de France_ that the Academy\r\nof Dijon had proposed as the subject for a prize to be awarded next\r\nyear the question, \"Has the progress of arts and sciences contributed\r\nto purify morals?\" Suddenly a tumult of ideas arose in his brain and\r\noverwhelmed him; it was an ecstasy of the intellect and the passions.\r\nWith Diderot's encouragement he undertook his indictment of\r\ncivilisation; in 1750 the _Discours sur les Sciences et les Arts_\r\nwas crowned. In accordance with his theory he proceeded to simplify\r\nhis own life, intensifying his self-consciousness by singularities\r\nof assumed austerity, and playing the part (not wholly a fictitious\r\none) of a moral reformer. Famous as author of the _Discours_ and the\r\nopera _Le Devin de Village_, presented before the King, he returned\r\nto his native Switzerland, and there re-entered the Protestant\r\ncommunion. In 1754 he again competed for a prize at Dijon, on the\r\nquestion, \"What is the origin of inequality among men, and is it\r\nauthorised by the law of nature?\" Rousseau failed to obtain the prize,\r\nbut the _Discours sur l'Inegalite_ was published (1755) with a\r\ndedication to the Republic of Geneva. He had discovered in private\r\nproperty the source of all the evils of society.\r\n\r\nIn Switzerland Rousseau prepared a first redaction of his political\r\ntreatise, the _Contrat Social_, and filled his heart with the beauty\r\nof those prospects which form an environment for the lovers in his\r\nHeloise. In 1756 he was established, through the kindness of Madame\r\nd'Epinay, in the Hermitage, near the borders of the forest of\r\nMontmorency. His delight in the woods and fields was great; his\r\ndelight in Madame d'Houdetot, kinswoman of his hostess, was a more\r\ntroubled passion. Quarrels with Madame d'Epinay, quarrels with Grimm\r\nand Diderot, estrangement from Madame d'Houdetot, closed the scene\r\nat the Hermitage.\r\n\r\nAuthorship, however, had its joys and consolations. The _Lettre a\r\nD'Alembert_, a censure of the theatre (1758), was succeeded by _La\r\nNouvelle Heloise_ (1761), by the _Contrat Social_ (1762), and _Emile_\r\n(1762). The days at Montmorency which followed his departure from\r\nthe Hermitage passed in calm. With the publication of _Emile_ the\r\nstorms began again. The book, condemned by the Sorbonne, was ordered\r\nby the Parliament to be burnt by the common executioner. Rousseau\r\nescaped imprisonment by flight. In Switzerland he could not settle\r\nnear Voltaire. A champion for the doctrine of a providential order\r\nof the world, an enemy of the stage--especially in republican\r\nGeneva--Rousseau had flung indignant words against Voltaire, and\r\nVoltaire had tossed back words of bitter scorn. Geneva had followed\r\nParis in its hostility towards Rousseau's recent publications; whose\r\ndoing could it be except Voltaire's? He fled from his persecutors\r\nto Motiers, where the King of Prussia's governor afforded him\r\nprotection. Renewed quarrels with his countrymen, clerical\r\nintolerance, mob violence, an envenomed pamphlet from Voltaire, once\r\nmore drove him forth. He took refuge on an island in the lake of Bienne,\r\nonly to be expelled by the authorities of Berne. Encouraged by\r\nHume--\"le bon David\"--he arrived in January 1766 in London.\r\n\r\nAt Wootton, in the Peak of Derbyshire, Rousseau prepared the first\r\nfive books of his _Confessions_. Within a little time he had assured\r\nhimself that Hume was joined with D'Alembert and Voltaire in a\r\ntriumvirate of persecutors to defame his character and render him\r\nan outcast; the whole human race had conspired to destroy him. Again\r\nRousseau fled, sojourned a year at Trye-Chateau under an assumed name,\r\nand after wanderings hither and thither, took refuge in Paris, where,\r\nliving meanly, he completed his _Confessions_, wrote other eloquent\r\npieces of self-vindication, and relieved his morbid cerebral\r\nexcitement by music and botanising rambles. The hospitality of M.\r\nde Girardin at Ermenonville was gladly accepted in May 1778; and there,\r\non July 2, he suddenly died; suicide was surmised; the seizure was\r\nprobably apoplectic.\r\n\r\nRousseau was essentially an idealist, but an idealist whose dreams\r\nand visions were inspired by the play of his sensibility upon his\r\nintellect and imagination, and therefore he was the least impersonal\r\nof thinkers. Generous of heart, he was filled with bitter suspicions;\r\ninordinately proud, he nursed his pride amid sordid realities;\r\ncherishing ideals of purity and innocence, he sank deep in the mire\r\nof imaginative sensuality; effeminate, he was also indomitable; an\r\nuncompromising optimist, he saw the whole world lying in wickedness;\r\na passionate lover of freedom, he aimed at establishing the most\r\nunqualified of tyrannies; among the devout he was a free-thinker,\r\namong the philosophers he was the sentimentalist of theopathy. He\r\nstands apart from his contemporaries: they did homage to the\r\nunderstanding; he was the devotee of the heart: they belonged to a\r\nbrilliant society; he was elated, suffered, brooded, dreamed in\r\nsolitude: they were aristocratic, at least by virtue of the\r\nintellectual culture which they represented; he was plebeian in his\r\norigin, and popular in his sympathies.\r\n\r\nHe became a great writer comparatively late in life, under the\r\ncompulsion of a ruling idea which lies at the centre of all his more\r\nimportant works, excepting such as are apologetic and autobiographical:\r\nNature has made man good and happy; society has made him evil and\r\nmiserable. Are we, then, to return to a state of primitive savagery?\r\nNo: society cannot retrograde. But in many ways we can ameliorate\r\nhuman life by approximating to a natural condition.\r\n\r\nIn the _Discours sur les Sciences et les Arts_, the _Discours sur\r\nl'Inegalite_, and the _Lettre a D'Alembert sur les Spectacles_,\r\nRousseau pleads against the vices, the artificiality, the\r\ninsincerities, the luxuries, the false refinements, the factitious\r\npassions, the dishonest pleasures of modern society. \"You make one\r\nwish,\" wrote Voltaire, \"to walk on all fours.\" By nature all men are\r\nborn free and equal; society has rendered them slaves, and impounded\r\nthem in classes of rich and poor, powerful and weak, master and servant,\r\npeasant and peer. Rousseau's conception of the primitive state of\r\nnature, and the origin of society by a contract, may not be\r\nhistorically exact--this he admits; nevertheless, it serves well,\r\nhe urges, as a working hypothesis to explain the present state of\r\nthings, and to point the way to a happier state. It exhibits property\r\nas the confiscation of natural rights; it justifies the sacred cause\r\nof insurrection; it teaches us to honour man as man, and the simple\r\ncitizen more than the noble, the scientific student, or the artist.\r\nPlain morals are the only safe morals. We are told that the theatre\r\nis a school of manners, purifying the passions; on the contrary, it\r\nirritates and perverts them; or it offers to ridicule the man of\r\nstraightforward virtue, as Moliere was not ashamed to do in his\r\n_Misanthrope_.\r\n\r\nHaving developed his destructive criticism against society as it is,\r\nRousseau would build up. In the _Contrat Social_ he would show how\r\nfreedom and government may be conciliated; how, through the\r\narrangements of society, man may in a certain sense return to the\r\nlaw of nature. \"Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains;\"\r\nyet social order, Rousseau declares, is sacred. Having resigned his\r\nindividual liberty by the social pact, how may man recover that\r\nliberty? By yielding his individual rights absolutely to a\r\nself-governing community of which he forms a part. The _volonte\r\ngenerale_, expressing itself by a plurality of votes, resumes the\r\nfree-will of every individual. If any person should resist the general\r\nwill, he thereby sacrifices his true freedom, and he must be \"forced\r\nto be free.\" Thus the dogma of the sovereignty of the people is\r\nformulated by Rousseau. Government is merely a delegation of power\r\nmade by the people as sovereign for the uses of the people as subjects.\r\nIn Rousseau's system, if the tyranny of the majority be established\r\nwithout check or qualification, at least equality is secured, for,\r\nin the presence of the sovereign people and its manifested will, each\r\nindividual is reduced to the level of all his fellows.\r\n\r\n_La Nouvelle Heloise_, in the form of a romance, considers the\r\npurification of domestic manners. Richardson's novels are followed\r\nin the epistolary style of narration, which lends itself to the\r\nexposition of sentiment. The story is simple in its incidents.\r\nSaint-Preux's crime of passion against his pupil Julie resembles that\r\nof Abelard against Eloisa. Julie, like Eloisa, has been a consenting\r\nparty. Obedient to her father's will, Julie marries Wolmar. In despair\r\nSaint-Preux wanders abroad. Wolmar offers him his friendship and a\r\nhome. The lovers meet, are tried, and do not yield to the temptation.\r\nJulie dies a victim to her maternal devotion, and not too\r\nsoon--\"Another day, perhaps, and I were guilty!\"\r\n\r\nIn 1757 Rousseau conceived the design of his romance. It might have\r\nbeen coldly edifying had not the writer's consuming passion for Madame\r\nd'Houdetot, awakening all that he had felt as the lover of Madame\r\nde Warens, filled it with intensity of ardour. In the first part of\r\nthe romance, passion asserts the primitive rights of nature; in the\r\nsecond part, those rights are shown to be no longer rights in an\r\norganised society. But the ideal of domestic life exhibited is one\r\nfar removed from the artificialities of the world of fashion: it is\r\na life of plain duties, patriarchal manners, and gracious beneficence.\r\nRousseau the moralist is present to rebuke Rousseau the\r\nsentimentalist; yet the sentimentalist has his own persuasive power.\r\nThe emotion of the lovers is reinforced by the penetrating influences\r\nof the beauty of external nature; and both are interpreted with\r\nincomparable harmonies of style and poignant lyrical cries, in which\r\nthe violin note outsoars the orchestra.\r\n\r\nA reform of domestic life must result in a reform of education.\r\nRousseau's ideal of education, capable of adaptations and\r\nmodifications according to circumstances, is presented in his\r\n_Emile_. How shall a child be formed in accordance, not with the\r\nvicious code of an artificial society, but in harmony with nature?\r\nRousseau traces the course of Emile's development from birth to adult\r\nyears. Unconstrained by swaddling-bands, suckled by his mother, the\r\nchild enjoys the freedom of nature, and at five years old passes into\r\nthe care of his father or his tutor. During the earlier years his\r\neducation is to be negative: let him be preserved from all that is\r\nfalse or artificial, and enter upon the heritage of childhood, the\r\ngladness of animal life, vigorous delights in sunshine and open air;\r\nat twelve he will hardly have opened a book, but he will have been\r\nin vital relation with real things, he will unconsciously have laid\r\nthe foundations of wisdom. When the time for study comes, that study\r\nshould be simple and sound--no Babel of words, but a wholesome\r\nknowledge of things; he may have learnt little, but he will know that\r\nlittle aright; a sunrise will be his first lesson in cosmography;\r\nhe may watch the workman in his workshop; he may practise the\r\ncarpenter's trade; he may read _Robinson Crusoe_, and learn the lesson\r\nof self-help. Let him ask at every moment, \"What is the good of this?\"\r\nUnpuzzled by questions of morals, metaphysics, history, he will have\r\ngrown up laborious, temperate, patient, firm, courageous.\r\n\r\nAt fifteen the passions are awake; let them be gently and wisely guided.\r\nLet pity, gratitude, benevolence be formed within the boy's heart,\r\nso that the self-regarding passions may fall into a subordinate place.\r\nTo read Plutarch is to commune with noble spirits; to read Thucydides\r\nis almost to come into immediate contact with facts. The fables of\r\nLa Fontaine will serve as a criticism of the errors of the passions.\r\n\r\nAnd now Emile, at eighteen, may learn the sublime mysteries of that\r\nfaith which is professed by Rousseau's Savoyard vicar. A Will moves\r\nthe universe and animates nature; that Will, acting through general\r\nlaws, is guided by supreme intelligence; if the order of Providence\r\nbe disturbed, it is only through the abuse of man's free-will; the\r\nsoul is immaterial and survives the body; conscience is the voice\r\nof God within the soul; \"dare to confess God before the philosophers,\r\ndare to preach humanity before the intolerant;\" God demands no other\r\nworship than that of the heart. With such a preparation as this, Emile\r\nmay at length proceed to aesthetic culture, and find his chief delight\r\nin those writers whose genius has the closest kinship to nature.\r\nFinally, in Sophie, formed to be the amiable companion and helpmate\r\nof man, Emile should find a resting-place for his heart. Alas, if\r\nshe should ever betray his confidence!\r\n\r\nThe _Confessions_, with its sequels in the _Dialogues, ou Rousseau\r\njuge de Jean-Jacques_, and the _Reveries du Promeneur Solitaire_,\r\nconstitute an autobiographical romance. The sombre colours of the\r\nlast six Books throw out the livelier lights and shades of the\r\npreceding Books. While often falsifying facts and dates, Rousseau\r\nwrites with all the sincerity of one who was capable of boundless\r\nself-deception. He will reserve no record of shame and vice and\r\nhumiliation, confident that in the end he must appear the most\r\nvirtuous of men. As the utterance of a soul touched and thrilled by\r\nall the influences of nature and of human life, the _Confessions_\r\naffects the reader like a musical symphony in which various movements\r\nare interpreted by stringed and breathing instruments. If Rousseau\r\nhere is less of the prophet than in his other writings, he is more\r\nof the great enchanter. Should a moral be drawn from the book, the\r\nauthor would have us learn that nature has made man good, that society\r\nhas the skill to corrupt him, and finally that it is in his power\r\nto refashion himself to such virtue as the world most needs and most\r\nimpatiently rejects.\r\n\r\nThe influence of Rousseau cannot easily be over-estimated. He\r\nrestored the sentiment of religion in an age of abstract deism or\r\nturbid materialism. He inaugurated a moral reform. He tyrannised over\r\nFrance in the person of his disciple Robespierre. He emancipated the\r\npassions from the domination of the understanding. He liberated the\r\nimagination. He caught the harmonies of external nature, and gave\r\nthem a new interpretation.[1] He restored to French prose, colour,\r\nwarmth, and the large utterance which it had lost. He created a\r\nliterature in which all that is intimate, personal, lyrical asserted\r\nits rights, and urged extravagant claims. He overthrew the classical\r\nideal of art, and enthroned the _ego_ in its room.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Among writers who fostered the new feeling for external\r\nnature, Ramond (1755-1827), who derived his inspiration, partly\r\nscientific, partly imaginative, from the Swiss Alps and the Pyrenees,\r\ndeserves special mention.]\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe fermentation of ideas was now quickened by the new life of\r\npassion--passion social and democratic as the days of Revolution\r\napproached; passion also personal and private, which, welcomed as\r\na sacred fire, too often made the inmost being of the individual a\r\nscene of agitating and desolating conflict.\r\n\r\nThe Abbe Raynal (1713-96) made his _Histoire des Deux Indes_ a\r\nreceptacle not only for just views and useful information, but for\r\nevery extravagance of thought and sentiment. \"Insert into my book,\"\r\nhe said to his brother philosophers, \"everything that you choose\r\nagainst God, against religion, and against government.\" In the third\r\nedition appears a portrait of the author, posing theatrically, with\r\nthe inscription, \"To the defender of humanity, of truth, of liberty!\"\r\nThe _salons_ caught the temper of the time. Voltairean as they were,\r\ndisposed to set down Rousseau as an enthusiast or a charlatan, they\r\ncould not resist the invasion of passion or of sensibility. It mingled\r\nwith a swarm of incoherent ideas and gave them a new intensity of\r\nlife. The incessant play of intellect flashed and glittered for many\r\nspirits over a moral void; the bitter, almost misanthropic temper\r\nof Chamfort's maxims and _pensees_ may testify to the vacuity of faith\r\nand joy; sentiment and passion came to fill the void; to desire, to\r\nlove, to pity, to suffer, to weep, was to live the true life of the\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nMadame du Deffand (1697-1780) might oppose the demon of ennui with\r\nthe aid of a cool temperament and a brilliant wit; at sixty-eight,\r\nwhatever ardour had been secretly stored up in her nature escaped\r\nto lavish itself half-maternally on Horace Walpole. Her young\r\ncompanion and reader, who became a rival and robbed her _salon_ of\r\nits brilliance, Mlle. de Lespinasse (1732?-76) might cherish a calm\r\nfriendship for D'Alembert. When M. de Guibert came to succeed M. de\r\nMora in her affections, she poured out the lava torrent of passion\r\nin those Letters which have given her a place beside Sappho and beside\r\nEloisa. Madame Roland in her girlhood had been the ardent pupil of\r\nRousseau, whose _Nouvelle Heloise_ was to her as a revelation from\r\nheaven. The first appearance in literature of Madame Necker's amazing\r\ndaughter was as the eulogist of Rousseau.\r\n\r\nThe intellect untouched by emotion may be aristocratic; passion and\r\nsentiment have popular and democratic instincts. \"The Revolution was\r\nalready in action,\" said Napoleon, \"when in 1784 Beaumarchais's\r\n_Mariage de Figaro_ appeared upon the stage.\" If Napoleon's words\r\noverstate the fact, we may at least name that masterpiece of comedy\r\na symptom of the coming explosion, or even, in Sainte-Beuve's words,\r\nan armed Fronde.\r\n\r\nPierre-Augustin Caron, who took the name of BEAUMARCHAIS (1732-99),\r\nson of a watchmaker of Paris, was born under a merry star, with a\r\ntrue genius for comedy, yet his theatrical pieces were only the\r\nrecreations of a man of affairs--a demon of intrigue--determined to\r\nbuild up his fortune by financial adventures and commercial\r\nenterprises. Suddenly in 1774-75 he leaped into fame. Defeated in\r\na trial in which his claim to fifteen thousand livres was disputed,\r\nBeaumarchais, in desperate circumstances, made his appeal to public\r\nopinion in four _Memoires_, which admirably united seriousness,\r\ngaiety, argument, irony, eloquence, and dramatic talent. \"I am a\r\ncitizen,\" he cried--\"that is to say, something wholly new, unknown,\r\nunheard of in France. I am a citizen--that is to say, what you should\r\nhave been two hundred years ago, what perhaps you will be twenty years\r\nhence.\" The word \"citizen\" sounded strange in 1774; it was soon to\r\nbecome familiar.\r\n\r\nBefore this incident Beaumarchais had produced two dramas, _Eugenie_\r\nand _Les Deux Amis_, of the tearful, sentimental, bourgeois type,\r\nyet with a romantic tendency, which distinguishes at least _Eugenie_\r\nfrom the bourgeois drama of Diderot and of Sedaine. The failure of\r\nthe second may have taught their author the wisdom of mirth; he\r\nabandoned his high dramatic principles to laugh and to evoke laughter.\r\n_Le Barbier de Seville_, developed from a comic opera to a comedy\r\nin five acts, was given, after long delays, in 1775. The spectators\r\nmanifested fatigue; instantly the play reappeared in four acts,\r\nBeaumarchais having lost no time in removing the fifth wheel from\r\nhis carriage. It delighted the public by the novelty of its abounding\r\ngaiety, a gaiety full and free, yet pointed with wit, a revolving\r\nfirework scattering its dazzling spray. The old comic theme of the\r\namorous tutor, the charming pupil, the rival lover, adorned with the\r\nprestige of youth, the intriguing attendant, was renewed by a dialogue\r\nwhich was alive with scintillating lights.\r\n\r\nFrom the success of the _Barbier_ sprang _Le Mariage de Figaro_.\r\nCompleted in 1778, the royal opposition to its performance was not\r\novercome until six years afterwards. By force of public opinion the\r\nwatchmaker's son had triumphed over the King. The subject of the play\r\nis of a good tradition--a daring valet disputes the claim of a\r\nlibertine lord to the possession of his betrothed. Spanish colour\r\nand Italian intrigue are added to the old mirth of France. From Regnard\r\nthe author had learnt to entangle a varied intrigue; from Lesage he\r\nborrowed his Spanish costumes and decoration--Figaro himself is a\r\nGil Blas upon the stage; in Marivaux he saw how women may assert\r\nthemselves in comic action with a bright audacity. The _Mariage de\r\nFigaro_ resumes the past; it depicts the present, as a social satire,\r\nand a painting of manners; it conveys into art the experience, the\r\nspirit, the temerity of Beaumarchais's adventurous life as a man of\r\nthe world; it creates characters--Almaviva, Suzanne, Figaro himself,\r\nthe budding Cherubin. It is at the same time--or, rather, became\r\nthrough its public reception--a pamphlet in comedy which announces\r\nthe future; it ridicules the established order with a sprightly\r\ninsolence; it pleads for social equality; it exposes the iniquity\r\nof aristocratic privilege, the venality of justice, the greed of\r\ncourtiers, the chicanery of politicians. Figaro, since he appeared\r\nin \"The Barber of Seville,\" has grown somewhat of a moralist and a\r\npedant; he must play the part of censor of society, he must represent\r\nthe spirit of independent criticism, he must maintain the cause of\r\nintelligence against the authority of rank and station. Beaumarchais\r\nmay have lacked elevation and delicacy, but he knew his craft as a\r\ndramatist, and left a model of prose comedy from which in later years\r\nothers of his art and mystery made profitable studies. He restored\r\nmirth to the stage; he rediscovered theatrical intrigue; he created\r\na type, which was Beaumarchais himself, and was also the lighter\r\ngenius of France; he was the satirist of society; he was the\r\nnimble-feathered bird that foretells the storm.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nBERNARDIN DE SAINT-PIERRE connects Rousseau with Chateaubriand and\r\nthe romantic school of the nineteenth century. The new feeling for\r\nexternal nature attained through him a wider range, embracing the\r\nromance of tropic lands; it acquired an element of the exotic; at\r\nthe same time, descriptive writing became more vivid and picturesque,\r\nand the vocabulary for the purposes of description was enlarged. He\r\nadded to French literature a tale in which human passion and the\r\nsentiment of nature are fused together by the magic of genius; he\r\ncreated two figures which live in the popular imagination, encircled\r\nwith a halo of love and sorrow.\r\n\r\nBorn at Havre in 1737, Bernardin, through his imagination, was an\r\nUtopian visionary, an idyllic dreamer; through his temper, an angry\r\ndisputant with society. His life was a fantastic series of adventures.\r\nHaving read as a boy the story of Crusoe, and listened to the heroic\r\nrecord of the travels and sufferings of Jesuit missionaries, his fancy\r\ncaught fire; he would seek some undiscovered island in mid-ocean,\r\nhe would found some colony of the true children of nature, far from\r\na corrupt civilisation, peaceable, virtuous, and free.\r\n\r\nIn France, in Russia, he was importunate in urging his extravagant\r\ndesigns upon persons of influence. When the French Government in 1767\r\ncommissioned him to work in Madagascar, he believed that his dream\r\nwas to come true, but a rude awakening and the accustomed quarrels\r\nfollowed. He landed on the Isle of France, purposing to work as an\r\nengineer, and there spent his days in gazing at the sea, the skies,\r\nthe mountains, the tropical forests. All forms and colours and sounds\r\nand scents impressed themselves on his brain, and were transferred\r\nto his collection of notes. When, on returning to Paris, he published\r\n(1773) his _Voyage a l'Ile de France_, the literature of picturesque\r\ndescription may be said to have been founded. Already in this volume\r\nhis feeling for nature is inspired by an emotional theism, and is\r\nburdened by his sentimental science, which would exhibit a fantastic\r\narray of evidences of the designs for human welfare of an amiable\r\nand ingenious Author of nature. Before the book appeared, Bernardin\r\nhad made the acquaintance of Rousseau, then living in retirement,\r\ntormented by his diseased suspicions and cloudy indignations. To his\r\nnew disciple Rousseau was in general gracious, and they rambled\r\ntogether, botanising in the environs of Paris.\r\n\r\nFor a time Bernardin himself was in a condition bordering upon\r\ninsanity; but the crisis passed, and he employed himself on the\r\n_Etudes de la Nature_, which appeared in three volumes in 1784. The\r\ntale of _Paul et Virginie_ was not included; for when the author had\r\nread it aloud, though ladies wept, the sterner auditors had been\r\ncontemptuous; Thomas slumbered, and Buffon called for his carriage.\r\nThe _Etudes_ accumulate the grotesque notions of Bernardin with\r\nreference to final causes in nature: nature is benevolent and\r\nharmonious; society is corrupt and harsh; scientific truth is to be\r\ndiscovered by sentiment, and not by reason; the whole universe is\r\nplanned for the happiness of man; the melon is large because it was\r\ndesigned for the family; the pumpkin is larger, because Providence\r\nintended that it should be shared with our neighbours. Providence,\r\nindeed, in a sceptical and mocking generation, suffered cruelly at\r\nthe hands of its advocate. Yet Bernardin conveyed into his book a\r\nfeeling of the rich and obscure life and energy of nature; his\r\ndescriptive power is admirable. \"He desired,\" says M. Barine, \"to\r\nopen the door for Providence to enter; in fact he opened the door\r\nfor the great Pan,\" and in this he was a precursor of much that followed\r\nin literature.\r\n\r\nBernardin's fame was now established. In the sentimental reaction\r\nagainst the dryness of sceptical philosophy, in the return to a\r\nfeeling for the poetical aspect of things, he was looked upon as a\r\nleader. In the fourth volume of _Etudes_ (1788) he had courage to\r\nprint the tale of _Paul et Virginie_. It is an idyll of the tropics,\r\nwritten with the moral purpose of contrasting the beneficent\r\ninfluence of nature and of feeling with the dangers and evils of\r\ncivilised society and of the intellect. The children grow up side\r\nby side in radiant innocence and purest companionship; then passion\r\nmakes its invasion of their hearts. The didactic commonplaces and\r\nthe faded sentimentalities of the idyll may veil, but cannot hide,\r\nthe genuine power of those pages which tell of the modest ardours\r\nof first love. An element of melodrama mingles with the tragic close.\r\nThroughout we do more than see the landscape of the tropics: we feel\r\nthe life of external nature throbbing in sympathy with human emotion.\r\nSomething was gained by Bernardin from the _Daphnis and Chloe_ of\r\nLongus in the motives and the details of his story, but it is\r\nessentially his own. It had a resounding success, and among its most\r\nardent admirers was Napoleon.\r\n\r\nBernardin married at fifty-five, and became the father of a Paul and\r\na Virginie. On the death of his wife, whom he regarded as a faithful\r\nhousekeeper, he married again, and his life was divided between the\r\ndevotion of an old man's love and endless quarrels with his colleagues\r\nof the _Institut_. His later writings added nothing to his fame. _La\r\nChaumiere Indienne_--the story of a pariah who learns wisdom from\r\nnature and from the heart--has a certain charm, but it lacks the power\r\nof the better portions of _Paul et Virginie_. The _Harmonies de la\r\nNature_ is a feeble reflection of the _Etudes_. Chateaubriand, to\r\nwhom Bernardin was personally known, gave a grudging recognition of\r\nthe genius of his precursor. Lamartine, in after years, was a more\r\ngenerous disciple. In January 1814 Bernardin died, murmuring the name\r\nof God; among the great events of the time his death was almost\r\nunnoticed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nIn the second half of the eighteenth century, aided by the labours\r\nof the Academie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, came a revival\r\nof the study of antiquity and of the sentiment for classical art.\r\nThe Count de Caylus (1692-1765), travelling in Italy and the East\r\nwith the enthusiasm of an archaeologist, presented in his writings\r\nan ideal of beauty and grace which was new to sculptors and painters\r\nof the time. The discovery of Pompeii followed, after an interval,\r\nthe discovery of Herculaneum. The Abbe BARTHELEMY (1716-95) embodied\r\nthe erudite delights of a lifetime in his _Voyage du Jeune Anacharsis\r\nen Grece_ (1788), which seemed a revelation of the genius of Hellenism\r\nas it existed four centuries prior to the Christian era. It was an\r\nideal Greece--the Greece of Winckelmann and Goethe--unalterably\r\ngracious, radiantly calm, which was discovered by the eighteenth\r\ncentury; but it served the imaginative needs of the age. We trace\r\nits influence in the harmonious forms of Bernardin's and\r\nChateaubriand's imagining, and in the marbles of Canova. A poet, the\r\noffspring of a Greek mother and a French father--Andre Chenier--a\r\nlatter-day Greek or demi-Greek himself, and yet truly a man of his\r\nown century, interpreted this new ideal in literary art.\r\n\r\nBorn at Constantinople in 1762, ANDRE CHENIER was educated in France,\r\ntravelled in Switzerland and Italy, resided as secretary to the French\r\nAmbassador for three weary years in England--land of mists, land of\r\ndull aristocrats--returned to France in 1790, ardent in the cause\r\nof constitutional freedom, and defended his opinions and his friends\r\nas a journalist. The violences of the Revolution drove him into\r\nopposition to the Jacobin party. In March 1794 he was arrested; on\r\nthe 25th July, two days before the overthrow of Robespierre, Andre\r\nChenier's head fell on the scaffold.\r\n\r\nOnly two poems, the _Jeu de Paume_ and the _Hymne aux Suisses_, were\r\npublished by Chenier; after his death appeared in journals the _Jeune\r\nCaptive_ and the _Jeune Tarentine_; his collected poems, already\r\nknown in manuscript to lovers of literature, many of them fragmentary,\r\nwere issued in 1819. The romantic school had come into existence\r\nwithout his aid; but under Sainte-Beuve's influence it chose to regard\r\nhim as a predecessor, and during the years about 1830 he was studied\r\nand imitated as a master.\r\n\r\nHe belongs, however, essentially to the eighteenth century, to its\r\ngraceful sensuality, its revival of antiquity, its faith in human\r\nreason, its comprehensive science of nature and of society. In certain\r\nof his poems suggested by public occasions he is little more than\r\na disciple of Lebrun. His _Elegies_ are rather Franco-Roman than\r\nGreek; these, together with beauties of their own, have the\r\ncharacteristic rhetoric, the conventional graces, the mundane\r\nvoluptuousness of their age. His philosophical poem _Hermes_, of\r\nwhich we have designs and fragments, would have been the _De Rerum\r\nNatura_ of an admiring student of Buffon.\r\n\r\nIn his _Eglogues_ and his epic fragments he is a Greek or a demi-Greek,\r\nwho has learnt directly from Homer, from the pastoral and idyllic\r\npoets of antiquity, and from the Anthology. The Greece of Chenier's\r\nimagination is the ideal Greece of his time, more finely outlined,\r\nmore delicately coloured, more exquisitely felt by him than was\r\npossible with his contemporaries in an age of prose. \"It is the\r\nlandscape-painter's Greece,\" writes M. Faguet, \"the Greece of fair\r\nriver-banks, of gracious hill-slopes, of comely groups around a\r\nwell-head or a stream, of harmonious theories beside the voiceful\r\nsea, of dancing choirs upon the luminous heights, under the blue\r\nheavens, which lift to ecstasy his spirit, light as the light\r\nbreathing of the Cyclades.\"\r\n\r\nIn the _Iambes_, inspired by the emotions of the Revolution during\r\nhis months of imprisonment, Chenier united modern passion with the\r\nbeauty of classic form; satire in these loses its critical temper,\r\nand becomes truly lyrical. In his versification he attained new and\r\nalluring harmonies; he escaped from the rhythmical uniformity of\r\neighteenth-century verse, gliding sinuously from line to line and\r\nfrom strophe to strophe. He did over again for French poetry the work\r\nof the Pleiade, but he did this as one who was a careful student and\r\na critic of Malherbe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE FIFTH\r\n1789-1850\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\nTHE REVOLUTION AND THE EMPIRE--MADAME DE STAEL--CHATEAUBRIAND\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe literature of the Revolution and the Empire is that of a period\r\nof transition. Madame de Stael and Chateaubriand announce the future;\r\nthe writers of an inferior rank represent with declining power the\r\npast, and give some faint presentiment of things to come. The great\r\npolitical concussion was not favourable to art. Abstract ideas united\r\nwith the passions of the hour produced poetry which was of the nature\r\nof a declamatory pamphlet. Innumerable pieces were presented on the\r\nstage, but their literary value is insignificant.\r\n\r\nMarie-Joseph Chenier (1764-1811), brother of the great poet who\r\nperished on the scaffold, attempted to inaugurate a school of national\r\ntragedy in his _Charles IX._; neither he nor the public knew history\r\nor possessed the historical sentiment--his tragedy was a\r\nrevolutionary \"school of kings.\" Arnault, Legouve, Nepomucene\r\nLemercier were applauded for their classic dignity, or their depth\r\nof characterisation, or their pomp of language. The true tragedy of\r\nthe time was enacted in the streets and in the clubs. Comedy was\r\nwelcome in days of terror as at all other times. Collin d'Harleville\r\ndrew mirth from the infirmities and follies of old age in _Le Vieux\r\nCelibataire_ (1792); Fabre d'Eglantine moralised Moliere to the\r\ntaste of Rousseau by exhibiting a Philante debased by egoism and\r\naccommodations with the world; Louis Laya, during the trial of the\r\nKing, satirised the pretenders to patriotism in _L'Ami des Lois_,\r\nyet escaped the vengeance of the Jacobins.\r\n\r\nHistorical comedy, a novelty in art, was seen in Lemercier's _Pinto_\r\n(1799), where great events are reduced to petty dimensions, and the\r\ndestiny of nations is satirically viewed as a vulgar game of\r\ntrick-track. In his _Christophe Colomb_ of 1809 he dared to despise\r\nthe unities of time and place, and excited a battle, not bloodless,\r\namong the spectators. Exotic heroes suited the imperial regime.\r\nBaour-Lormian, the translator of _Ossian_ (1801), converted the\r\nstory of Joseph in Egypt into a frigid tragedy; Hector and Tippoo\r\nSahib, Mahomet II., and Ninus II. (with scenes of Spanish history\r\ntransported to Assyria) diversified the stage. The greatest success\r\nwas that of Raynouard's _Les Templiers_ (1805); the learned author\r\nwisely applied his talents in later years to romance philology. Among\r\nthe writers of comedy--Andrieux, Etienne, Duval, and others--Picard\r\nhas the merit of reproducing the life of the day, satirising social\r\nclasses and conditions with vivacity and careless mirth. In melodrama,\r\nPixerecourt contributed unconsciously to prepare the way for the\r\nromantic stage. Desaugiers, with his gift for gay plebeian song, was\r\nthe master of the vaudeville.\r\n\r\nSong of a higher kind had been heard twice or thrice during the\r\nRevolution. The lesser Chenier's _Chanson du Depart_ has in it a\r\nstirring rhetoric for soldiers of the Republic sent forth to war with\r\nthe acclaim of mother and wife and maiden, old men and little children.\r\nLebrun-_Pindare_, in his ode _Sur le Vaisseau le Vengeur_, does not\r\nquite stifle the sense of heroism under his flowers of classical\r\nimagery. Rouget de Lisle's improvised verse and music, _La\r\nMarseillaise_ (1792), was an inspiration which equally lent itself\r\nto the enthusiasm of victory and the gallantries of despair. The\r\npseudo-epics and the descriptive poetry of the Empire are laboured\r\nand lifeless. But Creuze de Lesser, in his _Chevaliers de la\r\nTable-Ronde_ (1812) and other poems, and Baour-Lormian, in his\r\n_Poesies Ossianiques_, widened the horizons of literature. The\r\n_Panhypocrisiade_ of Lemercier, published in 1819, but written\r\nseveral years earlier--an \"infernal comedy of the sixteenth\r\ncentury\"--is an amazing chaos of extravagance, incompetence, and\r\ngenius; it bears to Hugo's _Legende des Siecles_ the relation which\r\nthe megatherium or mastodon may bear to some less monstrous analogues.\r\n\r\nIf we are to look for a presentiment of Lamartine's poetry, we may\r\nfind it in the harmonious melancholy of Chenedolle, in the grace of\r\nFontanes' stanzas, in the timid elegiac strains of Millevoye. The\r\nspecial character of the poetry of the Empire lies in its combination\r\nof the tradition derived from the eighteenth century, with a certain\r\nreaching-forth to an ideal, by-and-by to be realised, which it could\r\nnot attain. Its comparative sterility is not to be explained solely\r\nor chiefly by the vigilance of the imperial censure of publications.\r\nThe preceding century had lost the large feeling for composition,\r\nfor beauty and severity of form; attention was fixed upon details.\r\nIf invention ceased to create, it must necessarily trick out what\r\nwas commonplace in ingenuities of decorative periphrasis. Literature\r\nin the eighteenth century had almost ceased to be art, and had become\r\na social and political weapon; under the imperial rule this militant\r\nfunction was withdrawn; what remained for literature but frigid\r\nambitions or petty adornments, until a true sense of art was once\r\nagain recovered?\r\n\r\nThe Revolution closed the _salons_ and weakened the influence of\r\ncultivated society upon literature. Journalism and the pamphlet\r\nfilled the place left vacant by the _salons_. The _Decade\r\nPhilosophique_ was the organ of the ideologists, who applied the\r\nconceptions of Condillac and his followers to literary and\r\nphilosophical criticism. In 1789 the _Journal des Debats_ was founded.\r\nMuch ardour of feeling, much vigour of intellect was expended in the\r\ncolumns of the public press. Among the contributors were Andre Chenier,\r\nMallet du Pin, Suard, Rivarol. With a little ink and a guillotine,\r\nCamille Desmoulins hoped to render France happy, prosperous, and\r\nrepublican. Heady, vain, pleasure-loving, gay, bitter, sensitive,\r\nwith outbreaks of generosity and moments of elevation, he did\r\nsomething to redeem his crimes and follies by pleas for justice and\r\nmercy in his journal, _Le Vieux Cordelier_, and died, with Danton\r\nas his companion, after a frenzy of resistance and despair.\r\n\r\nThe orators of the Revolution glorified doctrinaire abstractions,\r\noverflowed with sentimental humanity, and decorated their harangues\r\nwith heroic examples of Roman virtue. The most abstract, colourless,\r\nand academic was Rousseau's disciple, who took the \"Supreme Being\"\r\nunder his protection, Robespierre. The fervid spirit of the Girondins\r\nfound its highest expression in Vergniaud, who, with infirm character,\r\nfew ideas, and a hesitating policy, yet possessed a power of vibrating\r\nspeech. Danton, the Mirabeau of the populace, was richer in ideas,\r\nand with sudden accesses of imagination thundered in words which\r\ntended to action; but in general the Mountain cared more for deeds\r\nthan words. The young Saint-Just thrilled the Convention with icy\r\napothegms which sounded each, short and sharp, like the fall of the\r\nknife. Barnave, impetuous in his temper, was clear and measured in\r\ndiscourse, and once in opposition to Mirabeau, defending the royal\r\nprerogative, rose beyond himself to the height of a great occasion.\r\n\r\nBut it was MIRABEAU, and Mirabeau alone, who possessed the genius\r\nof a great statesman united with the gifts of an incomparable orator.\r\nBorn in 1749, of the old Riquetti family, impulsive, proud, romantic,\r\nyet clear of intellect and firmly grasping facts, a thinker and a\r\nstudent, calmly indifferent to religion, irregular in his conduct,\r\nthe passionate foe of his father, the passionate lover of his Sophie\r\nand of her child, he had conceived, and in a measure comprehended,\r\nthe Revolution long before the explosion came. Already he was a\r\ncopious author on political subjects. He knew that France needed\r\nindividual liberty and individual responsibility; he divined the\r\ndangers of a democratic despotism. He hoped by the decentralisation\r\nof power to balance Paris by the provinces, and quicken the political\r\nlife of the whole country; he desired to balance the constitution\r\nby playing off the King against the Assembly, and the Assembly against\r\nthe King, and to control the action of each by the force of public\r\nopinion. From Montesquieu he had learnt the gains of separating the\r\nlegislative, the executive, and the judicial functions. His hatred\r\nof aristocracy, enhanced by the hardship of imprisonment at Vincennes,\r\nled him to ignore an influence which might have assisted in the\r\nequilibration of power. As an orator his ample and powerful rhetoric\r\nrested upon a basis of logic; slow and embarrassed as he began to\r\nspeak, he warmed as he proceeded, negligent of formal correctness,\r\ndisdainful of the conventional classical decorations, magnificent\r\nin gesture, weaving together ideas, imagery, and passion. His speech,\r\nsaid Madame de Stael, was \"like a powerful hammer, wielded by a skilful\r\nartist, and fashioning men to his will.\" At the sitting of the Assembly\r\non April 2, 1791, the President announced, amid murmurs, \"Ah! il est\r\nmort,\" which anticipated his words, that Gabriel-Honore Riquetti was\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n\"The 18th Brumaire,\" writes M. Lanson, \"silenced the orators. For\r\nfifteen years a solitary voice was heard, imperious but eloquent....\r\nNapoleon was the last of the great Revolutionary orators.\" As he\r\nadvanced in power he dropped the needless ornaments of rhetoric, and\r\ncondensed his summons to action into direct, effective words, now\r\nsimple and going straight at some motive of self-interest, now\r\ngrandiose to seduce the imagination to his side. Speech with Napoleon\r\nwas a means of government, and he knew the temper of the men whom\r\nhe addressed. His own taste in literature was touched with\r\nsentimentality; _Ossian_ and _Werther_ were among his favourite\r\nbooks; but what may be styled the official literature of the Empire\r\nwas of the decaying classical or neo-classical tradition.\r\n\r\nYet while the democratic imperialism was the direct offspring of the\r\nRevolution with its social contract and its rights of man, it was\r\nnecessary to combat eighteenth-century ideas and defend the throne\r\nand the altar. Great scientific names--Laplace, Bichat, Cuvier,\r\nLamarck--testify to the fact that a movement which made the eighteenth\r\ncentury illustrious had not spent its force. Scholarship was laying\r\nthe bases for future constructions; Ginguene published in 1811 the\r\nfirst volumes of his _Histoire Litteraire de l'Italie_; Fauriel and\r\nRaynouard accumulated the materials for their historical, literary,\r\nand philological studies. Philosophy was turning away from\r\nsensationalism, which seemed to have said its final word, towards\r\nspiritualist conceptions. Maine de Biran (1766-1824) found in the\r\nprimitive fact of consciousness--the _nisus_ of the will--and in the\r\nself-recognition of the _ego_ as a cause, an escape from materialism.\r\nRoyer-Collard (1763-1845), afterwards more distinguished in\r\npolitics than he was in speculation, read for his class at the Sorbonne\r\nfrom the Scottish philosophy of Reid, and turned it by his commentary\r\nas a siege-train against the positions of Condillac.\r\n\r\nThe germs of new literary growths were in the soil; but the spring\r\ncame slowly, and after the storms of Revolution were spent, a chill\r\nwas in the air. Measureless hopes, and what had come of them? infinite\r\ndesire, and so poor an attainment! A disciple of Rousseau, who shared\r\nin his sentiment without his optimistic faith, and who, like Rousseau,\r\nfelt the beauty of external nature without Rousseau's sense of its\r\njoy, Etienne Pivert de SENANCOURT published in 1799 his _Reveries_,\r\na book of disillusion, melancholy atheism, and stoical resistance\r\nto sadness, a resistance which he was unable to sustain. It was\r\nfollowed in 1804 by _Obermann_, a romance in epistolary form, in which\r\nthe writer, disguised in the character of his hero, expresses a fixed\r\nand sterile grief, knowing not what he needs, nor what he loves, nor\r\nwhat he wills, lamenting without a cause and desiring without an\r\nobject. The glories of Swiss landscape, which quicken his imagination,\r\ndo not suffice to fill the void that is in his soul; yet perhaps in\r\nold age--if ever it come--he may resign himself to the infinite\r\nillusion of life. It is an indication of the current of the time that\r\nfifteen years later, when the _Libres Meditations_ appeared,\r\nSenancourt had found his way through a vague theopathy to autumnal\r\nbrightness, late-born hope, and tranquil reconcilement with\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nThe work of the professional critics of the time--Geoffroy, De Feletz,\r\nDussault, Hoffman--counts now for less than the words of one who was\r\nonly an amateur of letters, and a moralist who never moralised in\r\npublic. JOSEPH JOUBERT (1754-1824), the friend of Fontanes and of\r\nChateaubriand, a delicate spirit, filled with curiosity for ideas,\r\nand possessing the finest sense of the beauty of literature, lacked\r\nthe strength and self-confidence needful in a literary career. He\r\nread everything; he published nothing; but the _Pensees_, which were\r\ncollected from his manuscripts by Chateaubriand, and his letters\r\nreveal a thinker who loved the light, a studious dilettante charmed\r\nby literary grace, a writer tormented by the passion to put a volume\r\nin a page, a page in a phrase, a phrase in a word. Plato in philosophy,\r\nVirgil in poetry, satisfy his feeling for beauty and refinement of\r\nstyle. From Voltaire and Rousseau he turns away, offended by their\r\nlack of moral feeling, of sanity, of wisdom, of delicacy. A man of\r\nthe eighteenth century, Joubert had lifted himself into thin clear\r\nheights of middle air, where he saw much of the past and something\r\nof the future; but the middle air is better suited for speculation\r\nthan for action.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe movement towards the romantic theory and practice of art was\r\nfostered in the early years of the nineteenth century by two eminent\r\nwriters--one a woman with a virile intellect, the other a man with\r\nmore than a woman's imaginative sensibility--by GERMAINE DE STAEL\r\nand by Chateaubriand. The one exhibits the eighteenth century passing\r\ninto the nineteenth, receiving new developments, yet without a breach\r\nof continuity; the other represents a reaction against the ideas of\r\nthe age of the philosophers. Both opened new horizons--one, by the\r\ndivinations of her ardent intelligence; the other, by his creative\r\ngenius. Madame de Stael interpreted new ideas and defined a new theory\r\nof art. Chateaubriand was himself an extraordinary literary artist.\r\nThe style of the one is that of an admirable improvisator, a brilliant\r\nand incessant converser; that of the other is at its best a miracle\r\nof studied invention, a harmony of colour and of sound. The genius\r\nof the one was quickened in brilliant social gatherings; a Parisian\r\n_salon_ was her true seat of empire. The genius of the other was nursed\r\nin solitude by the tempestuous sea or on the wild and melancholy moors.\r\n\r\nGermaine Necker, born in 1766, daughter of the celebrated Swiss banker\r\nand future minister of France, a child of precocious intelligence\r\nand eager sympathies, reared amid the brilliant society of her\r\nmother's _salon_, a girl whose demands on life were large--demands\r\nof the intellect, demands of the heart--enamoured of the writings\r\nof Rousseau, married at twenty to the Swedish Ambassador, the Baron\r\nde Stael-Holstein, herself a light and an inspirer of the\r\nconstitutional party of reform in the early days of the Revolution,\r\nin her literary work opened fresh avenues for nineteenth-century\r\nthought. She did not recoil from the eighteenth century, but rather\r\ncarried forward its better spirit. The Revolution, as a social\r\nupheaval, she failed to understand; her ideal was liberty, not\r\nequality; and Necker's daughter was assured that all would be well\r\nwere liberty established in constitutional forms of government. A\r\nrepublican among aristocrats, she was an aristocrat among\r\nrepublicans. During the years of Revolutionary trouble, the years\r\nof her flights from Paris, her returns, excursions, and retreats,\r\nshe was sustained by her zeal for justice, her pity for the oppressed,\r\nand her unquenchable faith in human progress.\r\n\r\nA crude panegyric of Rousseau, certain political pamphlets, an _Essai\r\nsur les Fictions_, a treatise on the Influence of the Passions upon\r\nthe Happiness of Individuals and Nations (1796), were followed in\r\n1800 by her elaborate study, _De la Litterature consideree dans ses\r\nRapports avec les Institutions Sociales_. Its central idea is that\r\nof human progress: freedom, incarnated in republican institutions,\r\nwill assure the natural development of the spirit of man; a great\r\nliterature will be the offspring of progress and of freedom; and each\r\nnation will lend its lights to other nations to illuminate the general\r\nadvance. Madame de Stael hoped to cast the spell of her intellect\r\nover the young conqueror Bonaparte; Bonaparte regarded a political\r\nmeteor in feminine form with cold and haughty aversion. In 1802 the\r\nhusband, whom she had never loved, was dead. Her passion for Benjamin\r\nConstant had passed through various crises in its troubled career--a\r\nseries of attractions ending in repulsions, and repulsions leading\r\nto attractions, such as may be discovered in Constant's remarkable\r\nnovel _Adolphe_. They could neither decide to unite their lives, nor\r\nto part for ever. Adolphe, in Constant's novel, after a youth of\r\npleasure-seeking, is disenchanted with life; his love of Ellenore\r\nis that of one whose passions are exhausted, who loves for vanity\r\nor a new indulgence of egoism; but Ellenore, whose youth is past,\r\nwill abandon all for him, and she imposes on him the tyranny of her\r\ndevotion. Each is the other's torturer, each is the other's\r\nconsolation. In the mastery of his cruel psychology Constant\r\nanticipates Balzac.\r\n\r\nMadame de Stael lightened the stress of inward storm by writing\r\n_Delphine_, the story of a woman of genius, whose heroic follies bring\r\nher into warfare with the world. The lover of Delphine, violent and\r\nfeeble, sentimental and egoistic, is an accomplice of the world in\r\ndoing her wrong, and Delphine has no refuge but death in the wilds\r\nof America.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In the first edition, Delphine dies by her own hand.]\r\n\r\nIn 1803 Madame de Stael received orders to trouble Paris with her\r\ntorrent of ideas and of speech no longer. The illustrious victim of\r\nNapoleon's persecution hastened to display her ideas at Weimar, where\r\nGoethe protected his equanimity, as well as might be, from the storm\r\nof her approach, and Schiller endured her literary enthusiasm with\r\na sense of prostration. August Wilhelm von Schlegel, tutor to her\r\nsons, became the interpreter of Germany to her eager and apprehensive\r\nmind. Having annexed Germany to her empire, she advanced to the\r\nconquest of Italy, and had her Roman triumph. England, which she had\r\nvisited in her Revolutionary flights, and Italy conspired in the\r\ncreation of her novel _Corinne_ (1807). It is again the history of\r\na woman of genius, beautiful, generous, enthusiastic, whom the world\r\nunderstands imperfectly, and whom her English lover, after his fit\r\nof Italian romance, discards with the characteristic British phlegm.\r\nThe paintings of Italian nature are rhetorical exercises; the\r\nwriter's sympathy with art and history is of more value; the\r\ninterpretation of a woman's heart is alive with personal feeling.\r\nMadame de Stael's novels are old now, which means that they once were\r\nyoung, and for her own generation they had the freshness and charm\r\nof youth.\r\n\r\nHer father's death had turned her thoughts towards religion. A\r\nProtestant and a liberal, her spiritualist faith now found support\r\nin the moral strength of Christianity. She was not, like Chateaubriand,\r\nan epicurean and a Catholic; she did not care to decorate religion\r\nwith flowers, or make it fragrant with incense; it spoke to her not\r\nthrough the senses, but directly to the conscience, the affections,\r\nand the will. In the chapters of her book on Germany which treat of\r\n\"the religion of enthusiasm,\" her devout latitudinarianism finds\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nThe book _De l'Allemagne_, published in London in 1813, after the\r\nconfiscation and destruction of the Paris edition by the imperial\r\npolice, prepared the way by criticism for the romantic movement. It\r\ntreats of manners, letters, art, philosophy, religion, interpreting\r\nwith astonishing insight, however it may have erred in important\r\ndetails, the mind of Germany to the mind of France. It was a Germany\r\nof poets, dreamers, and metaphysicians, loyal and sincere, but\r\nincapable of patriotic passion, disqualified for action and for\r\nfreedom, which she in 1804 had discovered. The life of society\r\nproduces literature in France; the genius of inward meditation and\r\nsentiment produces literature in Germany. The literature and art of\r\nthe South are classical, those of the North are romantic; and since\r\nthe life of our own race and the spirit of our own religion are infused\r\ninto romantic art, it has in it possibilities of indefinite growth.\r\nMadame de Stael advanced criticism by her sense that art and\r\nliterature are relative to ages, races, governments, environments.\r\nShe dreamed of an European or cosmopolitan literature, in which each\r\nnation, while retaining its special characteristics, should be in\r\nfruitful communication with its fellows.\r\n\r\nIn 1811 Madame de Stael, when forty-five, became the wife of Albert\r\nde Rocca, a young Swiss officer, more than twenty years her junior.\r\nTheir courage was rewarded by six years of happiness. Austria, Poland,\r\nRussia, Sweden, England were visited. Upon the fall of Napoleon Madame\r\nde Stael was once more in Paris, and there in 1817 she died. The _Dix\r\nAnnees d'Exil_, posthumously published, records a portion of her\r\nagitated life, and exhales her indignation against her imperial\r\npersecutor. The unfinished _Considerations sur la Revolution\r\nFrancaise_, designed originally as an apology for Necker, defends\r\nthe Revolution while admitting its crimes and errors; its true object,\r\nas the writer conceived--political liberty--had been in the end\r\nattained; her ideal of liberty was indeed far from that of a\r\nrevolutionary democracy; England, liberal, constitutional, with a\r\nsystem at once popular and aristocratic, was the country in which\r\nshe saw her political aspirations most nearly realised.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nFRANCOIS-RENE DE CHATEAUBRIAND was born in 1768, at St.-Malo, of an\r\nancient Breton family. Except for the companionship of an elder sister,\r\nof fragile health and romantic temper, his childhood was solitary.\r\nThe presence of the old count his father inspired terror. The boy's\r\nsociety was with the waves and winds, or at the old chateau of Combourg,\r\nwith lonely woods and wilds. Horace, Tibullus, _Telemaque_, the\r\nsermons of Massillon, nourished his imagination or stimulated his\r\nreligious sentiment; but solitude and nature were his chief\r\ninspirers.\r\n\r\nAt seventeen he already seemed worn with the fatigue of unsatisfied\r\ndreaming, before he had begun to know life. A commission in the army\r\nwas procured for him. He saw, interested yet alien in heart, something\r\nof literary life in Paris; then in Revolution days (1791) he quitted\r\nFrance, and, with the dream of discovering the North-West Passage,\r\nset sail to America. If he did not make any geographical discovery,\r\nChateaubriand found his own genius in the western world. The news\r\nof the execution of Louis XVI. decided him to return; a Breton and\r\na royalist should show himself among the ranks of the emigrants. To\r\ngratify the wish of his family, he married before crossing the\r\nfrontier. Madame de Chateaubriand had the dignity to veil her sorrow\r\ncaused by an imperfect union, and at a later time she won such a portion\r\nof her husband's regard as he could devote to another than himself.\r\n\r\nThe episode of war having soon closed--not without a wound and a\r\nserious illness--he found a refuge in London, enduring dire poverty,\r\nbut possessing the consolation of friendship with Joubert and\r\nFontanes, and there he published in 1797 his first work, the _Essai\r\nsur les Revolutions_. The doctrine of human progress had been part\r\nof the religion of the eighteenth century; Chateaubriand in 1797 had\r\nfaith neither in social, nor political, nor religious progress. Why\r\nbe deceived by the hopes of revolution, since humanity can only circle\r\nfor ever through an exhausting round of illusions? The death of his\r\nmother and words of a dying sister awakened him from his melancholy\r\nmood; he resolved to write a second book, which should correct the\r\nerrors of the first, and exhibit a source of hope and joy in religion.\r\nTo the eighteenth century Christianity had appeared as a gross and\r\nbarbarous superstition; he would show that it was a religion of beauty,\r\nthe divine mother of poetry and of art, a spring of poetic thought\r\nand feeling alike through its dogma and its ritual; he would convert\r\nliterature from its decaying cult of classicism, and restore to honour\r\nthe despised Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nThe _Genie du Christianisme_, begun during its author's residence\r\nin London, was not completed until four years later. In 1801,\r\ndetaching a fragment from his poetic apology for religion, he\r\npublished his _Atala, ou les Amours de Deux Sauvages dans le Desert_.\r\nIt is a romance, or rather a prose poem, in which the magic of style,\r\nthe enchantment of descriptive power, the large feeling for nature,\r\nthe sensibility to human passion, conceal many infirmities of design\r\nand of feeling. Chateaubriand suddenly entered into his fame.\r\n\r\nOn April 18, 1802, the Concordat was celebrated with high solemnities;\r\nthe Archbishop of Paris received the First Consul within the portals\r\nof Notre-Dame. It was the fitting moment for the publication of the\r\n_Genie du Christianisme_. Its value as an argumentative defence of\r\nChristianity may not be great; but it was the restoration of religion\r\nto art, it contained or implied a new system of aesthetics, it was\r\na glorification of devout sentiment, it was a pompous manifesto of\r\nromanticism, it recovered a lost ideal of beauty. From Ronsard to\r\nChenier the aim of art had been to imitate the ancients, while\r\nimitating or interpreting life. Let us be national, let us be modern,\r\nlet us therefore be Christians, declared Chateaubriand, and let us\r\nseek for our tradition in the great Christian ages. It was a revolution\r\nin art for which he pleaded, and throughout the first half of the\r\nnineteenth century the revolution was in active progress.\r\n\r\nThe episode of _Rene_, which was included in the _Genie_, and\r\nafterwards published separately, has been described as a\r\nChristianised _Werther_; its passion is less frank, and even more\r\nremote from sanity of feeling, than that of Goethe's novel, but the\r\nsadness of the hero is more magnificently posed. A sprightly English\r\nlady described Chateaubriand as \"wearing his heart in a sling\"; he\r\ndid so during his whole life; and through Rene we divine the inventor\r\nof Rene carrying his wounded heart, as in the heroine we can discern\r\nsome features of his sister Lucile. In all his writings his feelings\r\ncentre in himself: he is a pure egoist through his sensibility; but\r\naround his own figure his imagination, marvellous in its expansive\r\npower, can deploy boundless perspectives.\r\n\r\nBoth _Atala_ and _Rene_, though brought into connection with the\r\n_Genie du Christianisme_, are in fact more closely related to the\r\nprose epic _Les Natchez_, written early, but held in reserve until\r\nthe publication of his collected works in 1826-31. _Les Natchez_,\r\ninspired by Chateaubriand's American travels, idealises the life of\r\nthe Red Indian tribes. The later books, where he escapes from the\r\npseudo-epic manner, have in them the finest spirit of his early years,\r\nhis splendour and delicacy of description, his wealth of imaginative\r\nreverie. Famous as the author of the _Genie_, Chateaubriand was\r\nappointed secretary to the embassy at Rome. The murder of the Duc\r\nd'Enghien alienated him from Napoleon. Putting aside the _Martyrs_,\r\non which he had been engaged, he sought for fresh imagery and local\r\ncolour to enrich his work, in a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, a record\r\nof which was published in his (1811) _Itineraire de Paris a\r\nJerusalem_.\r\n\r\nThe _Martyrs_ appeared in 1809. It was designed as a great example\r\nof that art, inspired by Christianity, on behalf of which he had\r\ncontended in the _Genie_; the religion of Christ, he would prove,\r\ncan create passions and types of character better suited for noble\r\nimaginative treatment than those of paganism; its supernatural\r\nmarvels are more than a compensation for the loss of pagan mythology.\r\nThe time chosen for his epopee in prose is the reign of the persecutor\r\nDiocletian; Rome and the provinces of the Empire, Gaul, Egypt, the\r\ndeserts of the Thebaid, Jerusalem, Sparta, Athens, form only portions\r\nof the scene; heaven and hell are open to the reader, but Chateaubriand,\r\nwhose faith was rather a sentiment than a passion, does not succeed\r\nin making his supernatural habitations and personages credible even\r\nto the fancy. Far more admirable are many of the terrestrial scenes\r\nand narrations, and among these, in particular the story of Eudore.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the travels which led him to Jerusalem, Chateaubriand\r\nhad visited Spain, and it was his recollections of the Alhambra that\r\nmoved him to write, about 1809, the _Aventures du Dernier des\r\nAbencerages_, published many years later. It shows a tendency towards\r\nself-restraint, excellent in itself, but not entirely in harmony with\r\nhis effusive imagination. With this work Chateaubriand's inventive\r\nperiod of authorship closed; the rest of his life was in the main\r\nthat of a politician. From the position of an unqualified royalist\r\n(1814-24) he advanced to that of a liberal, and after 1830 may be\r\ndescribed as both royalist and republican. His pamphlet of 1814, _De\r\nBonaparte et des Bourbons_, was declared by Louis XVIII. to be worth\r\nan army to his cause.\r\n\r\nIn his later years he published an _Essai sur la Litterature Anglaise_\r\nand a translation of \"Paradise Lost.\" But his chief task was the\r\nrevision of the _Memoires d'Outre-Tombe_, an autobiography designed\r\nfor posthumous publication, and actually issued in the pages of the\r\n_Presse_, through the indiscreet haste of the publishers, while\r\nChateaubriand was still living. Its egotism, its vanity, its\r\nmalicious wit, its fierce reprisals on those whom the writer regarded\r\nas his enemies, its many beauties, its brilliance of style, make it\r\nan exposure of all that was worst and much of what was best in his\r\ncharacter and genius. Tended by his old friend Mme. Recamier, to whom,\r\nif to any one, he was sincerely attached, Chateaubriand died in the\r\nsummer of 1848. His tomb is on the rocky islet of Grand-Be, off the\r\ncoast of Brittany.\r\n\r\nChateaubriand cannot be loved, and his character cannot be admired\r\nwithout grave reserves. But an unique genius, developed at a fortunate\r\ntime, enabled him to play a most significant part in the history of\r\nliterature. He was the greatest of landscape painters; he restored\r\nto art the sentiment of religion; he interpreted the romantic\r\nmelancholy of the age. If he posed magnificently, there were native\r\nimpulses which suggested the pose; and at times, as in the\r\n_Itineraire_, the pose is entirely forgotten. His range of ideas is\r\nnot extraordinary; but vision, imagination, and the passion which\r\nmakes the imaginative power its instrument, were his in a supereminent\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\nTHE CONFLICT OF IDEAS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the imagination of France was turning towards the romance of\r\nthe Middle Ages and the art of Christianity, Hellenic scholarship\r\nwas maintained by Jean-Francois Boissonade. The representative of\r\nHellenism in modern letters was Courier, a brave but undisciplined\r\nartillery officer under Napoleon, who loved the sight of a Greek\r\nmanuscript better than he loved a victory. PAUL-LOUIS COURIER DE MERE\r\n(1772-1825) counts for nothing in the history of French thought; in\r\nthe history of French letters his pamphlets remain as masterpieces\r\nof Attic grace, luminous, light and bright in narrative, easy in\r\ndialogue, of the finest irony in comment, impeccable in measure and\r\nin malice. The translator of _Daphnis and Chloe_, wearied by war and\r\nwanderings in Italy, lived under the Restoration among his vines at\r\nVeretz, in Touraine. In 1816 he became the advocate of provincial\r\npopular rights against the vexations of the Royalist reaction. He\r\nis a vine-dresser, a rustic bourgeois, occupied with affairs of the\r\nparish. Shall Chambord be purchased for the Duke of Burgundy? shall\r\nan intolerant young _cure_ forbid the villagers to dance? shall\r\nmagistrates harass the humble folk? Such are the questions agitating\r\nthe country-side, which the vine-dresser Courier will resolve. The\r\nquestions have been replaced to-day by others; but nothing has quite\r\nreplaced the _Simple Discours_, the _Petition pour les Villageois_,\r\nthe _Pamphlet des Pamphlets_, in which the ease of the best sixteenth\r\nand seventeenth century prose is united with a deft rapier-play like\r\nthat of Voltaire, and with the lucidity of the writer's classical\r\nmodels.\r\n\r\nChateaubriand's artistic and sentimental Catholicism was the\r\nsatisfaction of imaginative cravings. When JOSEPH DE MAISTRE\r\n(1753-1821) revolted against the eighteenth century, it was a revolt\r\nof the soul; when he assailed the authority of the individual reason,\r\nit was in the name of a higher reason. Son of the President of the\r\nSenate of Savoy, he saw his country invaded by the French Republican\r\nsoldiery in 1792, and he retired to Lausanne. He protested against\r\nthe Revolutionary aggression in his _Lettres d'un Royaliste\r\nSavoisien_; inspired by the mystical Saint-Martin, in his\r\n_Considerations sur la France_, he interpreted the meaning of the\r\ngreat political cataclysm as the Divine judgment upon France--assigned\r\nby God the place of the leader of Christendom, the eldest daughter of\r\nthe Church--for her faithlessness and proud self-will. The sacred\r\nchastisement accomplished, monarchy and Catholicism must be restored\r\nto an intact and regenerated country. During fifteen years Maistre\r\nserved the King of Sardinia as envoy and plenipotentiary at the\r\nRussian Court, maintaining his dignity in cruel distress upon the\r\nsalary of a clerk. Amiable in his private life, he was remorseless--with\r\nthe stern charity of an inquisitor--in dogma. In a style of\r\nextraordinary clearness and force he expounded a system of ideas,\r\nlogically connected, on which to base a complete reorganisation of\r\nEuropean society. Those ideas are set forth most powerfully in the\r\ndialogues entitled _Les Soirees de Saint-Petersbourg_ and the\r\ntreatises _Du Pape_ and _De l'Eglise Gallicane_.\r\n\r\nHe honours reason; not the individual reason, source of innumerable\r\nerrors, but the general reason, which, emanating from God, reveals\r\nuniversal and immutable truth--_quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab\r\nomnibus_. To commence philosophising we should despise the\r\nphilosophers. Of these, Bacon, to whose errors Maistre devotes a\r\nspecial study, is the most dangerous; Locke is the most contemptible.\r\nThe eighteenth century spoke of nature; Maistre speaks of God, the\r\nGrand Monarch who rules His worlds by laws which are flexible in His\r\nhands. To punish is the prime duty of authority; the great Justiciary\r\navenges Himself on the whole offending race of men; there is no\r\ngovernment without an executioner. But God is pitiful, and allows\r\nus the refuge of prayer and sacrifice. Without religion there is no\r\nsociety; without the Catholic Church there is no religion; without\r\nthe sovereign Pontiff there is no Catholic Church. The sovereignty\r\nof the Pope is therefore the keystone of civilisation; his it is to\r\ngive and take away the crowns of kings. Governments absolute over\r\nthe people, the Pontiff absolute over governments--such is the\r\nearthly reflection of the Divine monarchy in heaven. To suppose that\r\nmen can begin the world anew from a Revolutionary year One, is the\r\nfolly of private reason; society is an organism which grows under\r\nprovidential laws; revolutions are the expiation for sins. Such are\r\nthe ideas which Maistre bound together in serried logic, and deployed\r\nwith the mastery of an intellectual tactician. The recoil from\r\nindividualism to authority could not have found a more absolute\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nThe Vicomte de Bonald (1754-1840), whose theocratic views have much\r\nin common with those of Maistre, and of his teacher Saint-Martin,\r\ndwelt on the necessity of language as a condition of thought, and\r\nmaintained that language is of divine origin. Ballanche (1776-1847),\r\nhalf poet, half philosopher, connected theocratic ideas with a theory\r\nof human progress--a social and political palingenesis--which had\r\nin it the elements of political liberalism. Theocracy and liberalism\r\nmet in the genius of FELICITE-ROBERT DE LAMENNAIS (1782-1854); they\r\nengaged after a time in conflict, and in the end the victory lay with\r\nhis democratic sympathies. A Breton and a priest, Lamennais, endowed\r\nwith imagination, passion, and eloquence, was more a prophet than\r\na priest. He saw the world around him perishing through lack of faith;\r\nreligion alone could give it life and health; a Church, freed from\r\npolitical shackles, in harmony with popular tendencies, governed by\r\nthe sovereign Pontiff, might animate the world anew. The voice of\r\nthe Catholic Church is the voice of humanity, uttering the general\r\nreason of mankind. When the _Essai sur l'Indifference en Matiere de\r\nReligion_ appeared, another Bossuet seemed to have arisen. But was\r\na democratic Catholicism possible? Lamennais trusted that it might\r\nbe so, and as the motto of the journal _L'Avenir_ (1830), in which\r\nLacordaire and Montalembert were his fellow-labourers, he chose the\r\nwords _Dieu et Liberte_.\r\n\r\nThe orthodoxy of the _Avenir_ was suspected. Lamennais, with his\r\nfriends, journeyed to Rome \"to consult the Lord in Shiloh,\" and in\r\nthe _Affaires de Rome_ recorded his experiences. The Encyclical of\r\n1832 pronounced against the doctrines dearest to his heart and\r\nconscience; he bowed in submission, yet he could not abandon his\r\ninmost convictions. His hopes for a democratic theocracy failing,\r\nhe still trusted in the peoples. But the democracy of his desire and\r\nfaith was one not devoted to material interests; to spiritualise the\r\ndemocracy became henceforth his aim. In the _Paroles d'un Croyant_\r\nhe announced in rhythmical prose his apocalyptic visions. \"It is,\"\r\nsaid a contemporary, \"a _bonnet rouge_ planted on a cross.\" In his\r\nelder years Lamennais believed in a spiritual power, a common thought,\r\na common will directing society, as the soul directs the body, but,\r\nlike the soul, invisible. His metaphysics, in which it is attempted\r\nto give a scientific interpretation and application to the doctrine\r\nof the Trinity, are set forth in the _Esquisse d'une Philosophie_.\r\nHis former associates, Lacordaire, the eloquent Dominican, and\r\nMontalembert, the historian, learned and romantic, of Western\r\nmonasticism, remained faithful children of the Church. Lamennais,\r\nno less devout in spirit than they, died insubmissive, and above his\r\ngrave, among the poor of Pere-Lachaise, no cross was erected.\r\n\r\nThe antagonism to eighteenth-century thought assumed other forms\r\nthan those of the theocratic school. VICTOR COUSIN (1792-1867), a\r\npupil of Maine de Biran and Royer-Collard, became at the age of\r\ntwenty-three a lecturer on philosophy at the Sorbonne. He was\r\nenthusiastic, ambitious, eloquent; with scanty knowledge he spoke\r\nas one having authority, and impressed his hearers with the force\r\nof a ruling personality. Led on from Scotch to German philosophy,\r\nand having the advantage of personal acquaintance with Hegel, he\r\nadvanced through psychology to metaphysics. Not in the senses but\r\nin the reason, impersonal in its spontaneous activity, he recognised\r\nthe source of absolute truth; in the first act of consciousness are\r\ndisclosed the finite, the infinite, and their mutual relations. In\r\nthe history of philosophy, in its four great systems of sensationalism,\r\nidealism, scepticism, mysticism, he recognised the substance of\r\nphilosophy itself undergoing the process of evolution; each system\r\nis true in what it affirms, false in what it denies. With psychology\r\nas a starting-point, and eclecticism as a method, Cousin attempted\r\nto establish a spiritualist doctrine. A young leader in the domain\r\nof thought, he became at a later time too imperious a ruler. In the\r\nwritings of his disciple and friend THEODORE JOUFFROY (1796-1842)\r\nthere is a deeper accent of reality. Doubting, and contending with\r\nhis doubts, Jouffroy brooded upon the destiny of man, made inquisition\r\ninto the problems of psychology, refusing to identify mental science\r\nwith physiology, and applied his remarkable powers of patient and\r\nsearching thought to the solution of questions in morals and\r\naesthetics. The school of Cousin has been named eclectic; it should\r\nrather be named spiritualist. The tendencies to which it owed its\r\norigin extended beyond philosophy, and are apparent in the literary\r\nart of Cousin's contemporaries.\r\n\r\nAs a basis for social reconstruction the spiritualist philosophy was\r\nineffectual. Another school of thought issuing from the Revolution,\r\nyet opposing its anarchic individualism, aspired to regenerate\r\nsociety by the application of the principles of positive science.\r\nCLAUDE-HENRI DE SAINT-SIMON (1760-1825), and FRANCOIS-CHARLES\r\nFOURIER (1772-1837), differing in many of their opinions, have a\r\ncommon distinction as the founders of modern socialism.\r\nSaint-Simon's ideal was that of a State controlled in things of the\r\nmind by men of science, and in material affairs by the captains of\r\nindustry. The aim of society should be the exploitation of the globe\r\nby associative effort. In his _Nouveau Christianisme_ he thought to\r\ndeliver the Christian religion from the outworn superstition, as he\r\nregarded it, alike of Catholicism and Protestantism, and to point\r\nout its true principle as adapted to our nineteenth century--that\r\nof human charity, the united effort of men towards the well-being\r\nof the poorest class.\r\n\r\nSaint-Simon, fantastic, incoherent, deficient in the scientific\r\nspirit and in the power of co-ordinating his results, yet struck out\r\nsuggestive ideas. A great and systematic thinker, AUGUSTE COMTE\r\n(1798-1857), who was associated with Saint-Simon from 1817 to 1824,\r\nperceived the significance of these ideas, and was urged forward by\r\nthem to researches properly his own. The positivism of Comte consists\r\nof a philosophy and a polity, in which a religion is involved. The\r\nquickening of his emotional nature through an adoring friendship with\r\nMme. Clotilde de Vaux, made him sensible of the incompleteness of\r\nhis earlier efforts at an intellectual reconstruction; he felt the\r\nneed of worship and of love. Comte's philosophy proceeds from the\r\ntheory that all human conceptions advance from the primitive\r\ntheological state, through the metaphysical--when abstract forces,\r\noccult causes, scholastic entities are invented to explain the\r\nphenomena of nature--to the positive, when at length it is recognised\r\nthat human knowledge cannot pass beyond the region of phenomena. With\r\nthese stages corresponds the progress of society from militarism,\r\naggressive or defensive, to industrialism. The several abstract\r\nsciences--those dealing with the laws of phenomena rather than with\r\nthe application of laws--are so arranged by Comte as to exhibit each\r\nmore complex science resting on a simpler, to which it adds a new\r\norder of truths; the whole erection, ascending to the science of\r\nsociology, which includes a dynamical as well as a statical doctrine\r\nof human society--a doctrine of the laws of progress as well as of\r\nthe laws of order--is crowned by morals.\r\n\r\nIn the polity of positivism the supreme spiritual power is entrusted\r\nto a priesthood of science. Their moral influence will be chiefly\r\ndirected to reinforcing the social feeling, altruism, as against the\r\npredominance of self-love. The object of religious reverence is not\r\nGod, but the \"Great Being\"--Humanity, the society of the noble living\r\nand the noble dead, the company, or rather the unity, of all those\r\nwho contribute to the better life of man. To Humanity we pay our vows,\r\nwe yield our gratitude, we render our homage, we direct our\r\naspirations; for Humanity we act and live in the blessed subordination\r\nof egoistic desire. Women--the mother, the wife, the daughter--purifying\r\nthrough affection the energies of man, act, under the Great Being, as\r\nangelic guardians, accomplishing a moral providence.\r\n\r\nComte's theory of the three states, theological, metaphysical, and\r\npositive, was accepted by PIERRE JOSEPH PROUDHON (1809-65), a far\r\nmore brilliant writer, a far less constructive thinker, and aided\r\nhim in arriving at conclusions which differ widely from those of Comte.\r\nSon of a cooper at Besancon, Proudhon had the virtues of a true child\r\nof the people--integrity, affection, courage, zeal, untiring energy.\r\nReligion he would replace by morality, ardent, strict, and pure. Free\r\nassociations of workmen, subject to no spiritual or temporal\r\nauthority, should arise over all the land. _Qu'est-ce que la\r\nPropriete?_ he asked in the title of a work published in 1840; and\r\nhis answer was, _La Propriete c'est le Vol_. Property, seizing upon\r\nthe products of labour in the form of rent or interest, and rendering\r\nno equivalent, is theft. Justice demands that service should be repaid\r\nby an equal service. Society, freely organising itself on the\r\nprinciples of liberty and justice, requires no government; only\r\nthrough such anarchy as this can true order be attained. An apostle\r\nof modern communism, Proudhon, by ideas leavening the popular mind,\r\nbecame no insignificant influence in practical politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\nPOETRY OF THE ROMANTIC SCHOOL\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth century did homage to the reason; it sought for general\r\ntruths, scientific, social, political; its art was in the main an\r\ninheritance, diminished with lapse of time, from the classical art\r\nof the preceding century. With Rousseau came an outburst of the\r\npersonal element in literature, an overflow of sensibility, an\r\nenfranchisement of the passions, and of imagination as connected with\r\nthe passions; his eloquence has in it the lyrical note. The romantic\r\nmovement was an assertion of freedom for the imagination, and an\r\nassertion of the rights of individuality. Love, wonder, hope,\r\nmeasureless desire, strange fears, infinite sadness, the sentiment\r\nof nature, aspiration towards God, were born anew. Imagination,\r\nclaiming authority, refused to submit to the rules of classic art.\r\nWhy should the several literary species be impounded each in its\r\nseparate paddock? Let them mingle at the pleasure of the artist's\r\ngenius; let the epic and the drama catch what they can of the lyric\r\ncry; let tragedy and comedy meet and mix. Why remain in servitude\r\nto the models of Greece and Rome? Let all epochs and every clime\r\ncontribute to the enrichment of art. The primitive age was above all\r\nothers the age of poetry. The great Christian centuries were the\r\ncenturies of miracle and marvel, of spiritual exaltation and\r\ntranscendent passion. Honour, therefore, to our mediaeval\r\nforefathers! It is the part of reason to trust the imagination in\r\nthe imaginative sphere. Through what is most personal and intimate\r\nwe reach the truths of the universal heart of man. An image may at\r\nthe same time be a symbol; behind a historical tableau may lie a\r\nphilosophical idea.\r\n\r\nAt first the romantic movement was Christian and monarchical. Its\r\nassertion of freedom, its claims on behalf of the _ego_, its licence\r\nof the imagination, were in reality revolutionary. The intellect is\r\nmore aristocratic than the passions. The great spectacle of modern\r\ndemocracy deploying its forces is more moving than any pallid ideals\r\nof the past; it has the grandeur and breadth of the large phenomena\r\nof nature; it is wide as a sunrise; its advance is as the onset of\r\nthe sea, and has like rumours of victory and defeat. The romantic\r\nmovement, with no infidelity to its central principle, became modern\r\nand democratic.\r\n\r\nForeign life and literatures lent their aid to the romantic movement\r\nin France--the passion and mystery of the East; the struggle for\r\nfreedom in Greece; the old ballads of Spain; the mists, the solitudes,\r\nthe young heroes, the pallid female forms of Ossian; the feudal\r\nsplendours of Scott; the melancholy Harold; the mysterious Manfred;\r\nGoethe's champion of freedom, his victim of sensibility, his seeker\r\nfor the fountains of living knowledge; Schiller's revolters against\r\nsocial law, and his adventurers of the court and camp.\r\n\r\nWith the renewal of imagination and sentiment came a renewal of\r\nlanguage and of metre. The poetical diction of the eighteenth century\r\nhad grown colourless and abstract; general terms had been preferred\r\nto particular; simple, direct, and vivid words had been replaced by\r\nperiphrases--the cock was \"the domestic bird that announces the day.\"\r\nThe romantic poets sought for words--whether noble or vulgar--that\r\nwere coloured, concrete, picturesque. The tendency culminated with\r\nGautier, to whom words were valuable, like gems, for their gleam,\r\ntheir iridescence, and their hardness. Lost treasures of the language\r\nwere recovered; at a later date new verbal inventions were made. By\r\ndegrees, also, grammatical structure lost some of its rigidity;\r\nsentences and periods grew rather than were built; phrases were alive,\r\nand learnt, if there were a need, to leap and bound. Verse was moulded\r\nby the feeling that inspired it; the melodies were like those of an\r\nEolian harp, long-drawn or retracted as the wind swept or touched\r\nthe strings. Symmetry was slighted; harmony was valued for its own\r\nsake and for its spiritual significance. Rich rhymes satisfied or\r\nsurprised the ear, and the poet sometimes suffered through his\r\ncuriosity as a virtuoso. By internal licences--the mobile cesura,\r\nnew variations and combinations--the power of the alexandrine was\r\nmarvellously enlarged; it lost its monotony and became capable of\r\nevery achievement; its external restraints were lightened; verse\r\nglided into verse as wave overtaking wave. The accomplishment of these\r\nchanges was a gradual process, of which Hugo and Sainte-Beuve were\r\nthe chief initiators. Gautier and, in his elder years, Hugo\r\ncontributed to the later evolution of romantic verse. The influence\r\non poetical form of Lamartine, Vigny, Musset, was of minor importance.\r\n\r\nThe year 1822 is memorable; it saw the appearance of Vigny's _Poemes_,\r\nthe _Odes_ of Hugo, which announced a new power in literature, though\r\nthe direction of that power was not yet defined, and almost to the\r\nsame moment belongs the indictment of classical literature by Henri\r\nBeyle (\"Stendhal\") in his study entitled _Racine et Shakespeare_.\r\nAround Charles Nodier, in the library of the Arsenal, gathered the\r\nyoung revolters--among them Vigny, Sainte-Beuve, Emile Deschamps,\r\nafterwards the translator of _Romeo and Juliet_ and _Macbeth_, his\r\nbrother Antony, afterwards the translator of the _Divine Comedy_.\r\nThe first Cenacle was formed; in the _Muse Francaise_ and in the\r\n_Globe_ the principles of the new literary school were expounded and\r\nillustrated. Victor Hugo looked on with friendly intentions, but\r\nstill held aloof.\r\n\r\nJEAN-PIERRE DE BERANGER (1780-1857) was not one of this company of\r\npoets. A child of Paris, of humble parentage, he discovered, after\r\nvarious experiments, that his part was not that of a singer of large\r\nambitions. In 1815 his first collection of _Chansons_ appeared; the\r\nfourth appeared in 1833. Standing between the bourgeoisie and the\r\npeople, he mediated between the popular and the middle-class\r\nsentiment. His songs flew like town sparrows from garret to garden;\r\nimpudent or discreet, they nested everywhere. They seemed to be the\r\nembodied wisdom of good sense, good temper, easy morals, love without\r\nits ardours, poverty without its pains, patriotism without its\r\nfatigues, a religion on familiar terms with the _Dieu des bonnes gens_.\r\nIn his elder years a Beranger legend had evolved itself; he was the\r\nsage of democracy, the Socrates of the people, the patriarch to whom\r\npilgrims travelled to receive the oracles of liberal and benevolent\r\nphilosophy. Notwithstanding his faults in the pseudo-classic taste,\r\nBeranger was skilled in the art of popular song; he knew the virtue\r\nof concision; he knew how to evolve swiftly his little lyric drama;\r\nhe knew how to wing his verses with a volant refrain; he could catch\r\nthe sentiment of the moment and of the multitude; he could be gay\r\nwith touches of tenderness, and smile through a tear reminiscent of\r\ndeparted youth and pleasure and Lisette. For the good bourgeois he\r\nwas a liberal in politics and religion; for the people he was a\r\ndemocrat who hated the Restoration, loved equality more than liberty,\r\nand glorified the legendary Napoleon, representative of democratic\r\nabsolutism. In the history of politics the songs of Beranger count\r\nfor much; in the history of literature the poet has a little niche\r\nof his own, with which one may be content who, if he had not in elder\r\nyears supposed himself the champion of a literary revolution, might\r\nbe called modest.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAmong the members of the Cenacle was to be seen a poet already famous,\r\ntheir elder by several years, who might have been the master of a\r\nschool had he not preferred to dwell apart; one who, born for poetry,\r\nchose to look on verse as no more than an accident of his existence.\r\nIn the year 1820 had appeared a slender volume entitled _Meditations\r\nPoetiques_. The soul, long departed, returned in this volume to French\r\npoetry. Its publication was an event hardly less important than that\r\nof the _Genie du Christianisme_. The well-springs of pure inspiration\r\nonce more flowed. The critics, indeed, were not all enthusiastic;\r\nthe public, with a surer instinct, recognised in Lamartine the singer\r\nthey had for many years desired, and despaired to find.\r\n\r\nALPHONSE DE LAMARTINE, born at Macon in 1790, of royalist parents,\r\nhad passed his childhood among the tranquil fields and little hills\r\naround his homestead at Milly. From his mother he learned to love\r\nthe Bible, Tasso, Bernardin, and a christianised version of the\r\nSavoyard Vicar's faith; at a later time he read Chateaubriand,\r\nRousseau, Milton, Byron, and was enchanted by the wandering gleams\r\nand glooms of Ossian. From the melancholy of youth he was roused by\r\nItalian travel, and by that Italian love romance of Graziella, the\r\ncircumstances of which he has dignified for the uses of idealised\r\nautobiography. A deeper passion of love and grief followed; Madame\r\nCharles, the \"Julie\" of Lamartine's _Raphael_, the \"Elvire\" of his\r\n_Meditations_, died. Lamartine had versified already in a manner\r\nwhich has affinities with that of those eighteenth-century poets and\r\nelegiac singers of the Empire whom he was to banish from public regard.\r\nLove and grief evoked finer and purer strains; his deepest feelings\r\nflowed into verse with perfect sincerity and perfect spontaneity.\r\nWithout an effort of the will he had become the most illustrious poet\r\nof France.\r\n\r\nLamartine had held and had resigned a soldier's post in the body-guard\r\nof Louis XVIII. He now accepted the position of attache to the embassy\r\nat Naples; published in 1823 his _Nouvelles Meditations_, and two\r\nyears later _Le Dernier Chant du Pelerinage d'Harold_ (Byron's Childe\r\nHarold); after which followed a long silence. Secretary in 1824 to\r\nthe legation at Florence, he abandoned after a time the diplomatic\r\ncareer, and on the eve of the Revolution of July (1830) appeared again\r\nas a poet in his _Harmonies Poetiques et Religieuses_; travelled in\r\nthe East in company with his wife, and recorded his impressions in\r\nthe _Voyage en Orient_; entered into political life, at first a\r\nsolitary in politics as he had been in literature, but by degrees\r\nfinding himself drawn more and more towards democratic ideas. \"Where\r\nwill you sit?\" he was asked on his presentation in the Chamber. His\r\nsmiling reply, \"On the ceiling,\" was symbolical of the fact; but from\r\n\"the ceiling\" his exalted oratory, generous in temper, sometimes wise\r\nand well informed, descended with influence. _Jocelyn_ (1836), _La\r\nChute d'un Ange_ (1838), the _Recueillements Poetiques_ (1839),\r\nclosed the series of his poetical works, though he did not wholly\r\ncease from song.\r\n\r\nIn 1847 Lamartine's idealising _Histoire des Girondins_, brilliant\r\nin its romantic portraiture, had the importance of a political event.\r\nThe Revolution of February placed him for a little time at the head\r\nof affairs; as he had been the soul of French poetry, so for a brief\r\nhour he was the soul of the political life of France. With the victory\r\nof imperialism Lamartine retired into the shade. He was more than\r\nsixty years of age; he had lost his fortune and was burdened with\r\ndebt. His elder years were occupied with incessant improvisations\r\nfor the booksellers--histories, biographies, tales, criticism,\r\nautobiographic confidences flowed from his pen. It was a gallant\r\nstruggle and a sad one. Through the delicate generosity of Napoleon\r\nIII. he was at length relieved without humiliating concessions. In\r\n1869 Lamartine died in his eightieth year.\r\n\r\nHe was a noble dreamer in practical affairs, and just ideas formed\r\na portion of his dreams. Nature had made him an irreclaimable\r\noptimist; all that is base and ugly in life passed out of view as\r\nhe soared above earth in his luminous ether. Sadness and doubt indeed\r\nhe knew, but his sadness had a charm of its own, and there were\r\nconsolations in maternal nature, in love, in religious faith and\r\nadoration. His power of vision was not intense or keen; his\r\ndescriptions are commonly vague or pale; but no one could mirror more\r\nfaithfully a state of feeling divested of all material circumstance.\r\nThe pure and ample harmonies of his verse do not attack the ear, but\r\nthey penetrate to the soul. All the great lyric themes--God, nature,\r\ndeath, glory, melancholy, solitude, regret, desire, hope, love--he\r\ninterpreted on his instrument with a musician's inspiration.\r\nUnhappily he lacked the steadfast force of will, the inexhaustible\r\npatience, which go to make a complete artist; he improvised admirably;\r\nhe refused to labour as a master of technique; hence his diffuseness,\r\nhis negligences; hence the decline of his powers after the first\r\nspontaneous inspiration was exhausted.\r\n\r\nLamartine may have equalled but he never surpassed the best poems\r\nof his earliest volume. But the elegiac singer aspired to be a\r\nphilosophic poet, and, infusing his ideas into sentiment and\r\nnarrative, became the author of _Jocelyn_ and _La Chute d'un Ange_.\r\nRecalling and idealising an episode in the life of his friend the\r\nAbbe Dumont, he tells how Jocelyn, a child of humble parents--not\r\nyet a priest--takes shelter among the mountains from the\r\nRevolutionary terror; how a proscribed youth, Laurence, becomes his\r\ncompanion; how Laurence is found to be a girl; how friendship passes\r\ninto love; how, in order that he may receive the condemned bishop's\r\nlast confession, Jocelyn submits to become a priest; how the lovers\r\npart; how Laurence wanders into piteous ways of passion; how Jocelyn\r\nattends her in her dying hours, and lays her body among the hills\r\nand streams of their early love. It is Jocelyn who chronicles events\r\nand feelings in his journal of joy and of sorrow. Lamartine\r\nacknowledges that he had before him as a model the idyl dear to him\r\nin childhood--Bernardin's _Paul et Virginie_.\r\n\r\nThe poem is complete in itself, but it was designed as a fragment\r\nof that vast modern epopee, with humanity for the hero, of which _La\r\nChute d'un Ange_ was another fragment. The later poem, vast in\r\ndimensions, fantastic in subject, negligent in style, is a work of\r\nLamartine's poetic decline. We are among the mountains of Lebanon,\r\nwhere dwell the descendants of Cain. The angel, enamoured of the\r\nmaiden Daidha, becomes human. Through gigantic and incoherent\r\ninventions looms the idea of humanity which degrades itself by\r\nsubjugation to the senses, as in _Jocelyn_ we had seen the type of\r\nhumanity which ascends by virtue of aspirations of the soul. It was\r\na poor jest to say that the title of his poem _La Chute d'un Ange_\r\ndescribed its author. Lamartine had failed; he could not handle so\r\nvast a subject with plastic power; but in earlier years he had\r\naccomplished enough to justify us in disregarding a late failure--he\r\nhad brought back the soul to poetry.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAmong the romantic poets who made themselves known between 1820 and\r\n1830, ALFRED DE VIGNY is distinguished by the special character of\r\nhis genius, and by the fact that nothing in his poetry is derived\r\nfrom his contemporaries. Lamartine, Hugo, and, at a later date, Musset,\r\nfound models or suggestions in his writings. He, though for a time\r\nclosely connected with the romantic school, really stands apart and\r\nalone. Born in 1797, he followed the profession of his father, that\r\nof arms, and knew the hopes, the illusions, and the disappointments\r\nof military service at the time of the fall of the Empire and the\r\nBourbon restoration. He read eagerly in Greek literature, in the Old\r\nTestament, and among eighteenth-century philosophers. As early as\r\n1815 he wrote his admirable poem _La Dryade_, in which, before Andre\r\nChenier's verse had appeared, Chenier's fresh and delicate feeling\r\nfor antiquity was anticipated. In 1822 his first volume, _Poemes_,\r\nwas published, including the _Helena_, afterwards suppressed, and\r\ngroups of pieces classified as _Antiques_, _Judaiques_, and\r\n_Modernes_. Already his _Moise_, majestic in its sobriety, was\r\nwritten, though it waited four years for publication in the volume\r\nof _Poemes Antiques et Modernes_ (1826). Moses climbing the slopes\r\nof Nebo personifies the solitude and the heavy burden of genius; his\r\none aspiration now is for the sleep of death; and it is the lesser\r\nleader Joshua who will conduct the people into the promised land.\r\nThe same volume included _Eloa_, a romance of love which abandons\r\njoy through an impulse of divine pity: the radiant spirit Eloa, born\r\nfrom a tear of Christ, resigns the happiness of heaven to bring\r\nconsolation to the great lost angel suffering under the malediction\r\nof God. Other pieces were inspired by Spain, with its southern\r\nviolence of passion, and by the pass of Roncesvalles, with its\r\nchivalric associations.\r\n\r\nThe novel of _Cinq-Mars_, which had a great success, is a free\r\ntreatment of history; but Vigny's best work is rather the embodiment\r\nof ideas than the rendering of historical matter. His _Stello_ in\r\nits conception has something of kinship with _Moise_; in three prose\r\ntales relating the sufferings of Chatterton, Chenier, and Gilbert,\r\nit illustrates the sorrows of the possessors of genius. Vigny's\r\nmilitary experience suggested another group of tales, the _Servitude\r\net Grandeur Militaires_; the soldier in accepting servitude finds\r\nhis consolation in the duty at all costs of strenuous obedience.\r\n\r\nIn 1827 Vigny quitted the army, and next year took place his\r\nmarriage--one not unhappy, but of imperfect sympathy--to an English\r\nlady, Lydia Bunbury. His interest in English literature was shown\r\nby translations of _Othello_ and the _Merchant of Venice_. The former\r\nwas acted with the applause of the young romanticists, who worshipped\r\nShakespeare ardently if not wisely, and who bore the shock of hearing\r\nthe unclassical word _mouchoir_ valiantly pronounced on the French\r\nstage. The triumph of his drama of _Chatterton_ (1835) was\r\noverwhelming, though its glory to-day seems in excess of its deserts.\r\nTen years later Vigny was admitted to the Academy. But with the\r\nrepresentation of _Chatterton_, and at the moment of his highest fame,\r\nhe suddenly ceased from creative activity. Never was his mind more\r\nenergetic, never was his power as an artist so mature; but, except\r\na few wonderful poems contributed to the _Revue des Deux Mondes_,\r\nand posthumously collected, nothing was given by him to the world\r\nfrom 1835 to 1863, the year of his death.\r\n\r\nHe had always been a secluded spirit; external companionship left\r\nhim inwardly solitary; secret--so Sainte-Beuve puts it--in his\r\n\"tower of ivory\"; touching some mountain-summit for a moment--so\r\nDumas describes him--if he folded his wings, as a concession to\r\nhumanity. A great disillusion of passion had befallen him; but, apart\r\nfrom this, he must have retreated into his own sphere of ideas and\r\nof images, which seemed to him to be almost wronged by an attempt\r\nat literary expression. He looked upon the world with a disenchanted\r\neye; he despaired of the possibilities of life for himself and for\r\nall men; without declamation or display, he resigned himself to a\r\nsilent and stoical acceptance of the lot of man; but out of this calm\r\ndespair arose a passionate pity for his fellows, a pity even for things\r\nevil, such as his Eloa felt for the lost angel. _La Colere de Samson_\r\ngives majestic utterance to his despair of human love; his _Mont des\r\nOliviers_, where Jesus seeks God in vain, and where Judas lurks near,\r\nexpresses his religious despair. Nature, the benevolent mother, says\r\nVigny, is no mother, but a tomb. Yet he would not clamour against\r\nthe heavens or the earth; he would meet death silently when it comes,\r\nlike the dying wolf of his poem (_La Mort du Loup_), suffering but\r\nvoiceless. Wealth and versatility of imagination were not Vigny's\r\ngifts. His dominant ideas were few, but he lived in them; for them\r\nhe found apt imagery or symbol; and in verse which has the dignity\r\nof reserve and of passion controlled to sobriety, he let them as it\r\nwere involuntarily escape from the seclusion of his soul. He is the\r\nthinker among the poets of his time, and when splendours of colour\r\nand opulence of sound have passed away, the idea remains. In fragments\r\nfrom his papers, published in 1867, with the title _Journal d'un\r\nPoete_, the inner history of Vigny's spirit can be traced.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTo present VICTOR HUGO in a few pages is to carve a colossus on a\r\ncherry-stone. His work dominates half a century. In the years of exile\r\nhe began a new and greater career. During the closing ten years his\r\npowers had waned, but still they were extraordinary. Even with death\r\nhe did not retire; posthumous publications astonished and perhaps\r\nfatigued the world.\r\n\r\nVictor-Marie Hugo was born at Besancon on February 26, 1802, son of\r\na distinguished military officer--\r\n\r\n   \"_Mon pere vieux soldat, ma mere Vendeenne._\"\r\n\r\nMother and children followed Commandant Hugo to Italy in 1807; in\r\nSpain they halted at Ernani and at Torquemada--names remembered by\r\nthe poet; at Madrid a Spanish Quasimodo, their school servant, alarmed\r\nthe brothers Eugene and Victor. A schoolboy in Paris, Victor Hugo\r\nrhymed his chivalric epic, his tragedy, his melodrama--\"les betises\r\nque je faisais avant ma naissance.\" In 1816 he wrote in his manuscript\r\nbook the words, \"I wish to be Chateaubriand or nothing.\" At fifteen\r\nhe was the laureate of the Jeux Floraux, the \"enfant sublime\" of\r\nChateaubriand's or of Soumet's praise.\r\n\r\nFounder, with his brothers, of the _Conservateur Litteraire_, he\r\nentered into the society of those young aspirants who hoped to renew\r\nthe literature of France. In 1822 he published his _Odes et Poesies\r\nDiverses_, and, obtaining a pension from Louis XVIII., he married\r\nhis early playfellow Adele Foucher. Romances, lyrics, dramas\r\nfollowed in swift succession. Hugo, by virtue of his genius, his\r\ndomineering temper, his incessant activity, became the acknowledged\r\nleader of the romantic school. In 1841 he was a member of the Academy;\r\nfour years later he was created a peer. Elected deputy of Paris in\r\n1848, the year of revolution, he sat on the Right in the Constituant,\r\non the Left in the Legislative Assembly, tending more and more towards\r\nsocialistic democracy. The Empire drove him into exile--exile first\r\nat Brussels, then in Jersey, finally in Guernsey, where Hugo, in his\r\nown imagination, was the martyred but unsubdued demi-god on his\r\nsea-beaten rock. In 1870, on the fall of the Empire, he returned to\r\nParis, witnessed the siege, was elected to the National Assembly,\r\nurged a continuance of the war, spoke in favour of recognising\r\nGaribaldi's election, and being tumultuously interrupted by the\r\nRight, sent in his resignation. Occupied at Brussels in the interests\r\nof his orphaned grandchildren, he was requested to leave, on the\r\nground of his zeal on behalf of the fallen Communists; he returned\r\nto Paris, and pleaded in the _Rappel_ for amnesty. In 1875 he was\r\nelected a senator. His eightieth birthday was celebrated with\r\nenthusiasm. Three years later, on May 23, 1885, Victor Hugo died.\r\nHis funeral pomps were such that one might suppose the genius of France\r\nitself was about to be received at the Pantheon.\r\n\r\nIn Victor Hugo an enormous imagination and a vast force of will\r\noperated amid inferior faculties. His character was less eminent than\r\nhis genius. If it is vanity to take a magnified Brocken-shadow for\r\none's self and to admire its superb gestures upon the mist, never\r\nwas vanity more complete or more completely satisfied than his. He\r\nwas to himself the hero of a Hugo legend, and did not perceive when\r\nthe sublime became the ridiculous. Generous to those beneath him,\r\ncharitable to universal humanity, he was capable of passionate\r\nvindictiveness against individuals who had wounded his self-esteem;\r\nand, since whatever opposed him was necessarily an embodiment of the\r\npower of evil, the contest rose into one of Ormuzd against Ahriman.\r\nHis intellect, the lesser faculty, was absorbed by his imagination.\r\nVacuous generalities, clothed in magnificent rhetoric, could pass\r\nwith him for ideas; but his visions are sometimes thoughts in images.\r\nThe voice of his passions was leonine, but his moral sensibility\r\nwanted delicacy. His laughter was rather boisterous than fine. He\r\nis a poet who seldom achieved a faultless rendering of the subtle\r\npsychology of lovers' hearts; there was in him a vein of robust\r\nsensuality. Children were dear to him, and he knew their pretty ways;\r\na cynical critic might allege that he exploited overmuch the tender\r\ndomesticities. His eye seized every form, vast or minute, defined\r\nor vague; his feeling for colour was rather strong than delicate;\r\nhis vision was obsessed by the antithesis of light and shade; his\r\near was awake to every utterance of wind or wave; phantoms of sound\r\nattacked his imagination; he lent the vibrations of his nerves, his\r\nown sentiments, to material objects; he took and gave back the soul\r\nof things. Words for him were living powers; language was a moving\r\nmass of significant myths, from which he chose and which he\r\naggrandised; sensations created images and words, and images and\r\nwords created ideas. He was a master of all harmonies of verse; now\r\na solitary breather through pipe or flute; more often the conductor\r\nof an orchestra.\r\n\r\nTo say that Hugo was the greatest lyric poet of France is to say too\r\nlittle; the claim that he was the greatest lyric poet of all literature\r\nmight be urged. The power and magnitude of his song result from the\r\nfact that in it what is personal and what is impersonal are fused\r\nin one; his soul echoed orchestrally the orchestrations of nature\r\nand of humanity--\r\n\r\n   \"_Son ame aux mille voix, que le Dieu qu'il adore\r\n     Mit au centre de tout comme un echo sonore._\"\r\n\r\nAnd thus if his poetry is not great by virtue of his own ideas, it\r\nbecomes great as a reverberation of the sensations, the passions,\r\nand the thoughts of the world. He did not soar tranquilly aloft and\r\nalone; he was always a combatant in the world and wave of men, or\r\nborne joyously upon the flood. The evolution of his genius was a long\r\nprocess. The _Odes_ of 1822 and 1824, the _Odes et Ballades_ of 1826,\r\nCatholic and royalist in their feeling, show in their form a\r\nstruggling originality oppressed by the literary methods of his\r\npredecessors--J.-B. Rousseau, Lebrun, Casimir Delavigne. This\r\noriginality asserts itself chiefly in the _Ballades_. His early prose\r\nromances, _Han d'Islande_ (1823) and _Bug-Jargal_ (1826)--the one\r\na tale of the seventeenth-century man-beast of Norway, the other a\r\ntale of the generous St. Domingo slave--are challenges of youthful\r\nand extravagant romanticism. _Le Dernier Jour d'un Condamne_ (1829)\r\nis a prose study in the pathology of passion. The same year which\r\nsaw the publication of the last of these is also the year of _Les\r\nOrientales_. These poems are also studies--amazing studies in colour,\r\nin form, in all the secrets of poetic art. The East was popular--Hugo\r\nwas ever passionate for popularity--and Spain, which he had seen,\r\nis half-Oriental. But of what concern is the East? he had seen a sunset\r\nlast summer, and the fancy took him; the East becomes an occasion\r\nfor marvellous combinations of harmony and lustrous tinctures; art\r\nfor its own sake is precious.\r\n\r\nFrom 1827, when _Cromwell_ appeared, to 1843, when the epic in drama\r\n_Les Burgraves_ failed, Hugo was a writer for the stage, diverting\r\ntragedy from its true direction towards lyrical melodrama.[1] In the\r\noperatic libretto _La Esmeralda_ (1836) his lyrical virtuosity was\r\nfree to display itself in an appropriate dramatic form. The libretto\r\nwas founded on his own romance _Notre-Dame de Paris_ (1831), an\r\nevocation, more imaginative than historical, of the old city of the\r\nfifteenth century, its tragic passions, its strangeness, its horrors,\r\nand its beauty; it is a marvellous series of fantasies in black and\r\nwhite; things live in it more truly than persons; the cathedral, by\r\nits tyrannous power and intenser life, seems to overshadow the other\r\nactors. The tale is a juxtaposition of violent contrasts, an\r\nantithesis of darkness and light. Through Quasimodo afflicted\r\nhumanity appeals for pity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See section VII, this chapter.]\r\n\r\nIn the volume of verse which followed _Les Orientales_ after an\r\ninterval of two years, _Les Feuilles d'Automne_ (1831), Hugo is a\r\nmaster of his instrument, and does not need to display his miracles\r\nof skill; he is freer from faults than in the poetry of later years,\r\nbut not therefore more to be admired. His noblest triumphs were almost\r\ninevitably accompanied by the excesses of his audacity. Here the\r\nlyrism is that of memory and of the heart--intimate, tender, grave,\r\nwith a feeling for the hearth and home, a sensibility to the\r\ntranquillising influences of nature, a charity for human-kind, a\r\nfaith in God, a hope of immortality. Now and again, as in the epilogue,\r\nthe spirit of public indignation breaks forth--\r\n\r\n   \"_Et j'ajoute a ma lyre une corde d'airain._\"\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the _Chants du Crespuscule_ (1835) is one of doubt,\r\ntrouble, almost of gloom. Hugo's faith in the bourgeois monarchy is\r\nalready waning; he is a satirist of the present; he sees two things\r\nthat are majestic--the figure of Napoleon in the past, the popular\r\nflood-tide in the future which rises to threaten the thrones of kings.\r\nBut this tide is discerned, as it were, through a dimness of weltering\r\nmist. _Les Voix Interieures_ (1837) resumes the tendencies of the\r\ntwo preceding volumes; the dead Charles X. is reverently saluted;\r\nthe legendary Napoleon is magnified; the faith in the people grows\r\nclearer; the inner whispers of the soul are caught with heedful ear;\r\nthe voice of the sea now enters into Hugo's poetry; Nature, in the\r\nsymbolic _La Vache_, is the mother and the exuberant nurse of all\r\nliving things. In _Les Rayons et les Ombres_ (1840), Nature is not\r\nonly the nurse, but the instructress and inspirer of the soul,\r\nmingling spirit with spirit. Lamartine's _Le Lac_ and Musset's\r\n_Souvenir_ find a companion, not more pure, but of fuller harmonies,\r\nin the _Tristesse d'Olympio_; reminiscences of childhood are\r\nmagically preserved in the poem of the _Feuillantines_.\r\n\r\nFrom 1840 to 1853 Hugo as a lyrical poet was silent. Like Lamartine,\r\nhe had concerned himself with politics. A private grief oppressed\r\nhis spirits. In 1843 his daughter Leopoldine and her husband of a\r\nfew short months were drowned. In 1852 the poet who had done so much\r\nto magnify the first Napoleon in the popular imagination was the exile\r\nwho launched his prose invective _Napoleon le Petit_. A year later\r\nappeared _Les Chatiments_, in which satire, with some loss of critical\r\ndiscernment, is infused with a passionate lyrical quality,\r\nunsurpassed in literature, and is touched at times with epic grandeur.\r\nThe Empire, if it severed Hugo from the soil of France, restored him\r\nto himself with all his superb power and all his violences and errors\r\nof genius.\r\n\r\nThe volumes of _Les Contemplations_ (1856) mark the culmination of\r\nHugo's powers as a lyrical poet. The earlier pieces are of the past,\r\nfrom 1830 to 1843, and resemble the poems of the past. A group of\r\npoems, sacred to the memory of his daughter, follow, in which beauty\r\nand pathos are interpenetrated by a consoling faith in humanity, in\r\nnature, and in God. The concluding pieces are in a greater manner.\r\nThe visionary Hugo lives and moves amid a drama of darkness and of\r\nlight; gloom is smitten by splendour, splendour collapses into gloom;\r\nand darkness and light seem to have become vocal in song.\r\n\r\nBut a further development lay before him. The great lyric poet was\r\nto carry all his lyric passion into an epic presentation, in detached\r\nscenes, of the life of humanity. The first part of _La Legende des\r\nSiecles_ was published in 1859 (later series, 1877, 1883). From the\r\nbirth of Eve to the trumpet of judgment the vast cycle of ages and\r\nevents unrolls before us; gracious episodes relieve the gloom; beauty\r\nand sublimity go hand in hand; in the shadow the great criminals are\r\npursued by the great avengers. The spirit of _Les Chatiments_ is\r\nconveyed into a view of universal history; if kings are tyrants and\r\npriests are knaves, the people is a noble epic hero. This poem is\r\nthe epopee of democratic passions.\r\n\r\nThe same spirit of democratic idealism inspires Hugo's romance _Les\r\nMiserables_ (1862). The subject now is modern; the book is rather\r\nthe chaos of a prose epic than a novel; the hero is the high-souled\r\noutcast of society; everything presses into the pages; they are turn\r\nby turn historical, narrative, descriptive, philosophical (with such\r\nphilosophy as Hugo has to offer), humanitarian, lyrical, dramatic,\r\nat times realistic; a vast invention, beautiful, incredible, sublime,\r\nabsurd, absorbing in its interest, a nightmare in its tedium.\r\n\r\nWe have passed beyond the mid-century, but Hugo is not to be presented\r\nas a torso. In the tale _Les Travailleurs de la Mer_ (1866) the choral\r\nvoices of the sea cover the thinness and strain of the human voices;\r\nif the writer's genius is present in _L'Homme qui Rit_ (1869), it\r\noften chooses to display its most preposterous attitudes; the better\r\nscenes of _Quatre-vingt Treize_ (1874) beguile our judgment into the\r\ngenerous concessions necessary to secure an undisturbed delight.\r\nThese are Hugo's later poems in prose. In verse he revived the feelings\r\nof youth with a difference, and performed happy caprices of style\r\nin the _Chansons des Rues et des Bois_ (1865); sang the incidents\r\nand emotions of his country's sorrow and glory in _L'Annee Terrible_\r\n(1872), and--strange contrast--the poetry of babyland in _L'Art\r\nd'etre Grandpere_ (1877). Volume still followed volume--_Le Pape_,\r\n_La Pitie Supreme_, _Religions et Religion_, _L'Ane_, _Les Quatre\r\nVents de l'Esprit_, the drama _Torquemada_. The best pages in these\r\nvolumes are perhaps equal to the best in any of their author's\r\nwritings; the pages which force antithesis, pile up synonyms, develop\r\ncommonplaces in endless variations, the pages which are hieratic,\r\nprophetic, apocalyptic, put a strain upon the loyalty of our\r\nadmiration. The last legend of Hugo's imagination was the Hugo legend:\r\nif theism was his faith, autotheism was his superstition. Yet it is\r\neasy to restore our loyalty, and to rediscover the greatest lyric\r\npoet, the greatest master of poetic counterpoint that France has\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nALFRED DE MUSSET has been reproached with having isolated himself\r\nfrom the general interests and affairs of his time. He did not isolate\r\nhimself from youth or love, and the young of two generations were\r\nhis advocates. Born in 1810, son of the biographer of Rousseau, he\r\nwas a Parisian, inheriting the sentiment and the scepticism of the\r\neighteenth century. Impressionable, excitable, greedy of sensations,\r\nhe felt around him the void left by the departed glories of the Empire,\r\nthe void left by the passing away of religious faiths. One thing was\r\nnew and living--poetry. Chenier's remains had appeared; Vigny, Hugo,\r\nLamartine had opened the avenues for the imagination; Byron was dead,\r\nbut Harold and Manfred and Don Juan survived. Musset, born a poet,\r\nwas ready for imaginative ventures; he had been introduced, while\r\nstill a boy, to the Cenacle. Spain and Italy were the regions of\r\nromance; at nineteen he published his first collection of poems,\r\n_Contes d'Espagne et d'Italie_, and--an adolescent Cherubin-Don Juan\r\nof song--found himself famous.\r\n\r\nHe gave his adhesion to the romantic school, rather with the light\r\neffrontery of youth than with depth of conviction; he was impertinent,\r\nironical, incredulous, blasphemous, despairing, as became an elegant\r\nByron minor of the boulevards, aged nineteen. But some of the pieces\r\nwere well composed; all had the \"form and feature of blown youth\";\r\nthe echoes of southern lands had the fidelity and strangeness of\r\nechoes tossed from Paris backwards; certain passages and lines had\r\na classic grace; it might even be questioned whether the _Ballade\r\na la Lune_ was a challenge to the school of tradition, or a jest at\r\nthe expense of his own associates.\r\n\r\nA season of hesitation and of transition followed. Musset was not\r\ndisposed to play the part of the small drummer-boy inciting the\r\nromantic battalion to the double-quick. He began to be aware of his\r\nown independence. He was romantic, but he had wit and a certain\r\nintellectual good-sense; he honoured Racine together with Hugo; he\r\ncould not merge his individuality in a school. Yet, with an infirmity\r\ncharacteristic of him, Musset was discouraged. It was not in him to\r\nwrite great poetry of an impersonal kind; his _Nuit Venitienne_ had\r\nbeen hissed at the Odeon; and what had he to sing out of his own heart?\r\nHe resolved to make the experiment. Three years after his first volume\r\na second appeared, which announced by its title that, while still\r\na dramatic poet, he had abandoned the stage; the _Spectacle dans un\r\nFauteuil_ declared that, though his glass was small, it was from his\r\nown glass that he would drink.\r\n\r\nThe glass contained the wine of love and youth mingled with a grosser\r\npotion. In the drama _La Coupe et les Levres_ he exhibited libertine\r\npassion seeking alliance with innocence and purity, and incapable\r\nof attaining self-recovery; in _Namouna_, hastily written to fit the\r\nvolume for publication, he presented the pursuit of ideal love as\r\nconducting its victim through all the lures of sensual desire; the\r\ncomedy _A quoi revent les jeunes Filles_, with its charm of fantasy,\r\ntells of a father's device to prepare his daughters for the good prose\r\nof wedlock by the poetry of invented romance. Musset had emancipated\r\nhimself from the Cenacle, and would neither appeal to the eye with\r\nan overcharge of local colour, nor seduce the ear with rich or curious\r\nrhymes. Next year (1833) in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_ appeared\r\n_Rolla_, the poem which marks the culmination of Musset's early manner,\r\nand of Byron's influence on his genius; the prodigal, beggared of\r\nfaith, debased by self-indulgence, is not quite a disbeliever in love;\r\nthrough passion he hastens forward in desperation to the refuge of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nAt the close of 1833 Musset was with George Sand in Italy. The hours\r\nof illusion were followed by months of despair. He knew suffering,\r\nnot through the imagination, but in his own experience. After a time\r\ncalm gradually returned, and the poet, great at length by virtue of\r\nthe sincerity of genius, awoke. He is no longer frivolously despairing\r\nand elegantly corrupt. In _Les Nuits_--two of these (_Mai_,\r\n_Octobre_) inspired by the Italian joy and pain--he speaks simply\r\nand directly from the heart in accents of penetrating power. Solitude,\r\nhis constant friend, the Muse, and love rising from the grave of love,\r\nshall be his consolers--\r\n\r\n   \"_Apres avoir souffert, il faut souffrir encore;\r\n     Il faut aimer sans cesse, apres avoir aime._\"\r\n\r\nMusset's powers had matured through suffering; the _Lettre a\r\nLamartine_, the _Espoir en Dieu_, the _Souvenir_, the elegy _A la\r\nMalibran_, the later stanzas _Apres une Lecture_ (1842), are\r\nmasterpieces of the true Musset--the Musset who will live.\r\n\r\nAt thirty Musset was old. At rare intervals came the flash and outbreak\r\nof a fiery mind; but the years were years of lassitude. His patriotic\r\nsong, _Le Rhin Allemand_, is of 1841. In 1852 the Academy received\r\nhim. \"Musset s'absente trop,\" observed an Academician; the\r\nungracious reply, \"Il s'absinthe trop,\" told the truth, and it was\r\na piteous decline. In 1857, attended by the pious Sister Marceline,\r\nMusset died.\r\n\r\nPassion, the spirit of youth, sensibility, a love of beauty,\r\nintelligence, _esprit_, fantasy, eloquence, graceful converse--these\r\nwere Musset's gifts. He lacked ideas; he lacked the constructive\r\nimagination; with great capacities as a writer, he had too little of\r\nan artist's passion for perfection. His longest narrative in prose,\r\nthe _Confession d'un Enfant du Siecle_, has borne the lapse of time\r\nill. \"J'y ai vomi la verite,\" he said. It is not the happiest way of\r\ncommunicating truth, and the moral of the book, that debauchery ends\r\nin cynicism, was not left for Musset to discover. Some of his shorter\r\ntales have the charm of fancy or the charm of tenderness, with\r\nbreathings of nature here, and there the musky fragrance of a\r\nLouis-Quinze boudoir. _Pierre et Camille_, with its deaf-and-dumb\r\nlovers, and their baby, who babbles in the presence of the relenting\r\ngrandfather \"Bonjour, papa,\" has a pretty innocence. _Le Fils de\r\nTitien_ returns to the theme of fallen art, the ruin of self-indulgence.\r\n_Frederic et Bernerette_ and _Mimi Pinson_ may be said to have created\r\nthe poetic literature of the grisette--gay and good, or erring and\r\ndespairful--making a flower of what had blossomed in the stories of\r\nPaul de Kock as a weed.\r\n\r\nNext to the most admirable of his lyric and elegiac poems, Musset's\r\nbest _Comedies_ and _Proverbes_ (proverbial sayings exemplified in\r\ndramatic action), deserve a place. Written in prose for readers of\r\nthe _Revue des Deux Mondes_, their scenic qualities were discovered\r\nonly in 1847, when the actress Madame Allan presented _Un Caprice_\r\nand _Il faut qu'une Porte soit ouverte ou fermee_ at St. Petersburg.\r\nThe ambitious Shakespearian drama of political conspiracy,\r\n_Lorenzaccio_, was an effort beyond the province and the powers of\r\nMusset. His _Andre del Sarto_, a tragic representation of the great\r\npainter betrayed by his wife and his favourite pupil, needed the\r\nrelief of his happier fantasy. It is in such delicate creations of\r\na world of romance, a world of sunshine and of perpetual spring, as\r\n_On ne badine pas avec l'Amour_, _Les Caprices de Marianne_, _Le\r\nChandelier_, _Il ne faut jurer de rien_, that Musset showed how\r\nromantic art could become in a high sense classic by the balance of\r\nsensibility and intelligence, of fantasy and passion. The graces of\r\nthe age of Madame de Pompadour ally themselves here with the freer\r\ngraces of the Italian Renaissance. Something of the romance of\r\nShakespeare's more poetic comedies mingles with the artificial\r\nelegance of Marivaux. Their subject is love, and still repeated love;\r\nsentiment is relieved by the play of gaiety; the grotesque approaches\r\nthe beautiful; we sail in these light-timbered barques to a land that\r\nlies not very far from the Illyria and Bohemia and Arden forest of\r\nour own great enchanter.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nLyrical self-confession reached its limit in the poetry of Musset.\r\nDetachment from self and complete surrender to the object is the law\r\nof Gautier's most characteristic work; he is an eye that sees, a hand\r\nthat moulds and colours--that is all. A child of the South, born at\r\nTarbes in 1811, THEOPHILE GAUTIER was a pupil in the painter Rioult's\r\nstudio till the day when, his friend the poet Gerard de Nerval having\r\nsummoned him to take part in the battle of _Hernani_, he swore by\r\nthe skull from which Byron drank that he would not be a defaulter.\r\nHis first volume, _Poesies_, appeared in 1830, and was followed in\r\ntwo years by _Albertus_, a fantastic manufacture of strangeness and\r\nhorror, amorous sorcery, love-philtres, witches' Sabbaths. The\r\n_Comedie de la Mort_ evokes the illustrious shades of Raphael, Faust,\r\nDon Juan to testify to the vanity of knowledge and glory and art and\r\nlove. Gautier's romantic enthusiasm was genuine and ardent. The\r\n_Orientales_ was his poetic gospel; but the _Orientales_ is precisely\r\nthe volume in which Hugo is least effusive, and pursues art most\r\nexclusively for art's sake. Love and life and death in these early\r\npoems of Gautier are themes into which he works coloured and\r\npicturesque details; sentiment, ideas are of value to him so far as\r\nthey can be rendered in images wrought in high relief and tinctured\r\nwith vivid pigments.\r\n\r\nIt was the sorrow of Gautier's life, that born, as he believed, for\r\npoetry, he was forced to toil day after day, year after year, as a\r\ncritic of the stage and of the art-exhibitions. He performed his task\r\nin workman-like fashion, seeking rather to communicate impressions\r\nthan to pronounce judgments. His most valuable pieces of literary\r\ncriticism are his exhumations of the earlier seventeenth-century\r\npoets--Theophile, Cyrano, Saint-Amant, Scarron, and others--published\r\nin 1844, together with a study of Villon, under the title _Les\r\nGrotesques_, and the memoir of 1867, drawn up in compliance with the\r\nrequest of the Minister of Public Instruction, on _Les Progres de la\r\nPoesie Francaise depuis 1830_. A reader of that memoir to-day will\r\nfeel, with Swift, that literary reputations are dislimned and shifted\r\nas quickly and softly as the forms of clouds when the wind plays aloft.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 Gautier visited Spain; afterwards he saw Italy, Algeria,\r\nConstantinople, Russia, Greece. He travelled not as a student of life\r\nor as a romantic sentimentalist. He saw exactly, and saw all things\r\nin colour; the world was for him so much booty for the eye. Endowed\r\nwith a marvellous memory, an unwearied searcher of the vocabulary,\r\nhe could transfer the visual impression, without a faltering outline\r\nor a hue grown dim, into words as exact and vivid as the objects which\r\nhe beheld. If his imagination recomposed things, it was in the manner\r\nof some admired painter; he looked on nature through the medium of\r\na Zurbaran or a Watteau. The dictionary for Gautier was a collection\r\nof gems that flashed or glowed; he chose and set them with the skill\r\nand precision of a goldsmith enamoured of his art. At Athens, in one\r\nof his latest wanderings, he stood in presence of the Parthenon, and\r\nfound that he was a Greek who had strayed into the Middle Ages; on\r\nthe faith of _Notre-Dame de Paris_ he had loved the old cathedrals;\r\n\"the Parthenon,\" he writes, \"has cured me of the Gothic malady, which\r\nwith me was never very severe.\"\r\n\r\nGautier's tales attained one of their purposes, that of astonishing\r\nthe bourgeois; yet if he condescended to ideas, his ideas on all\r\nsubjects except art had less value than those of the philistine.\r\n_Mademoiselle de Maupin_ has lost any pretensions it possessed to\r\nsupereminent immorality; its sensuality is that of a dream of youth;\r\nsuch purity as it possesses, compared with books of acrid grossness,\r\nlies in the fact that the young author loved life and cared for beauty.\r\nIn shorter tales he studiously constructs strangeness--the sense of\r\nmystery he did not in truth possess--on a basis of exactly carved\r\nand exactly placed material. His best invention is the tale of actors\r\nstrolling in the time most dear to his imagination, the old days of\r\nLouis XIII., _Le Capitaine Fracasse_, suggested doubtless by\r\nScarron's _Roman Comique_, and patiently retouched during a quarter\r\nof a century.\r\n\r\nGautier as a poet found his true self in the little pieces of the\r\n_Emaux et Camees_. He is not without sensibility, but he will not\r\nembarrass himself with either feelings or ideas. He has emancipated\r\nhimself from the egoism of the romantic tendency. He sees as a painter\r\nor a gem-engraver sees, and will transpose his perceptions into\r\ncoloured and carven words. That is all, but that is much. He values\r\nwords as sounds, and can combine them harmoniously in his little\r\nstanzas. Life goes on around him; he is indifferent to it, caring\r\nonly to fix the colour of his enamel, to cut his cameo with unfaltering\r\nhand. When the Prussian assault was intended to the city, when\r\nRegnault gave away his life as a soldier, Gautier in the Muses' bower\r\nsat pondering his epithets and filing his phrases. Was it strength,\r\nor was it weakness? His work survives and will survive by virtue of\r\nits beauty--beauty somewhat hard and material, but such as the artist\r\nsought. In 1872 Gautier died. By directing art to what is impersonal\r\nhe prepared the way for the Parnassien school, and may even be\r\nrecognised as one of the lineal predecessors of naturalism.\r\n\r\nThese--Lamartine, Vigny, Hugo, Musset, Gautier--are the names which\r\nrepresent the poetry of nineteenth-century romance; four stars of\r\nvarying magnitudes, and one enormous cometary apparition. There was\r\nalso a _via lactea_, from which a well-directed glass can easily\r\ndisentangle certain orbs, pallid or fiery: Sainte-Beuve, a critic\r\nand analyst of moral disease and disenchantment in the _Vie, Poesies\r\net Pensees de Joseph Delorme_; a singer of spiritual reverie, modest\r\npleasures, modest griefs, and tender memories in the _Consolations_\r\nand the _Pensees d'Aout_; a virtuoso always in his metrical\r\nresearches; Auguste Barbier, eloquent in his indignant satires the\r\n_Iambes_, lover of Italian art and nature in _Il Pianto_; Auguste\r\nBrizeux, the idyllist, in his _Marie_, of Breton wilds and provincial\r\nworks and ways; Gerard de Nerval, Hegesippe Moreau, Madame\r\nDesbordes-Valmore, and paler, lessening lights. These and others\r\ndwindle for the eye into a general stream of luminous atoms.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nThe weaker side of the romantic school is apparent in the theatre.\r\nIt put forth a magnificent programme of dramatic reform, which it\r\nwas unable to carry out. The preface to Victor Hugo's _Cromwell_\r\n(1827) is the earliest and the most important of its manifestoes.\r\nThe poetry of the world's childhood, we are told, was lyrical; that\r\nof its youth was epic; the poetry of its maturity is dramatic. The\r\ndrama aims at truth before all else; it seeks to represent complete\r\nmanhood, beautiful and revolting, sublime and grotesque. Whatever\r\nis found in nature should be found in art; from multiple elements\r\nan aesthetic whole is to be formed by the sovereignty of imagination;\r\nunity of time, unity of place are worthless conventions; unity of\r\naction remains, and must be maintained. The play meant to exemplify\r\nthe principles of Hugo's preface is of vast dimensions, incapable\r\nof presentation on the stage; the large painting of life for which\r\nhe pleaded, and which he did not attain, is of a kind more suitable\r\nto the novel than to the drama. _Cromwell_, which departs little from\r\nthe old rules respecting time and place, is a flux and reflux of action,\r\nor of speeches in place of action, with the question of the hero's\r\nambition for kingship as a centre; its personages are lay figures\r\ndraped in the costumes of historical romance.\r\n\r\nThe genius of Hugo was pre-eminently lyrical; the movement to which\r\nhe belonged was also essentially lyrical, a movement for the\r\nemancipation of the personal element in art; it is by qualities which\r\nare non-dramatic that his dramas are redeemed from dishonour. When,\r\nin 1830, his _Hernani_ was presented at the Theatre Francais, a\r\nstrange, long-haired, bearded, fantastically-attired brigade of\r\nyoung supporters engaged in a melee with those spectators who\r\nrepresented the tyranny of tradition. \"Kill him! he is an\r\nAcademician,\" was heard above the tumult. Gautier's truculent\r\nwaistcoat flamed in the thickest of the fight. The enthusiasm of\r\nGautier's party was justified by splendours of lyrism and of oratory;\r\nbut Hugo's play is ill-constructed, and the characters are beings\r\nof a fantastic world. In _Marion Delorme_, in _Le Roi s'amuse_, in\r\nthe prose-tragedy _Lucrece Borgia_, Victor Hugo develops a favourite\r\ntheme by a favourite method--the moral antithesis of some purity of\r\npassion surviving amid a life of corruption, the apotheosis of virtue\r\ndiscovered in a soul abandoned to vice, and exhibited in violent\r\ncontrasts. Marion is ennobled by the sacrifice of whatever remains\r\nto her of honour; the moral deformity of Lucrece is purified by her\r\ninstinct of maternal love; the hideous Triboulet is beautiful by\r\nvirtue of his devotion as a father. The dramatic study of character\r\nis too often replaced by sentimental rhetoric. _Ruy Blas_, like\r\n_Marion Delorme_ and _Hernani_, has extraordinary beauties; yet the\r\nwhole, with its tears and laughter, its lackey turned minister of\r\nstate, its amorous queen, is an incredible phantasmagoria. _Angelo_\r\nis pure melodrama; _Marie Tudor_ is the melodrama of history. _Les\r\nBurgraves_ rises from declamation to poetry, or sinks from poetry\r\nto declamation; it is grandiose, epic, or, if the reader please,\r\nsymbolic; it is much that it ought not to be, much that is admirable\r\nand out of place; failing in dramatic truth, it fails with a certain\r\nsublimity. The logic of action, truth of characterisation, these in\r\ntragic creation are essentials; no heights or depths of poetry which\r\nis non-dramatic can entirely justify works which do not accept the\r\nconditions proper to their kind.\r\n\r\nThe tragedy of _Torquemada_, strange in conception, wonderful--and\r\nwonderfully unequal--in imaginative power, was an inspiration of\r\nHugo's period of exile, wrought into form in his latest years. The\r\ndramas of the earlier period, opening with an historical play too\r\nenormous for the stage, closed in 1843 with _Les Burgraves_, which\r\nis an epic in dialogue. Aspiring to revolutionary freedom, the\r\nromantic drama disdained the bounds of art; epic, lyric, tragedy,\r\ncomedy met and mingled, with a result too often chaotic. The desired\r\nharmony of contraries was not attained. Past ages were to be revived\r\nupon the stage. The historic evocation possessed too often neither\r\nhistoric nor human truth; it consisted in \"local colour,\" and local\r\ncolour meant a picturesque display of theatrical bric-a-brac. Yet\r\na drama requires some centre of unity. Failing of unity in coherent\r\naction and well-studied character, can a centre be provided by some\r\nphilosophical or pseudo-philosophical idea? Victor Hugo, wealthy in\r\nimagery, was not wealthy in original ideas; in grandiose prefaces\r\nhe attempted to exhibit his art as the embodiment of certain abstract\r\nconceptions. A great poet is not necessarily a philosophical poet.\r\nHugo's interpretations of his own art are only evidence of the fact\r\nthat a writer's vanity can practise on his credulity.\r\n\r\nAmong the romantic poets the thinker was Vigny. But it is not by its\r\nphilosophical symbolism that his _Chatterton_ lives; it is by virtue\r\nof its comparative strength of construction, by what is sincere in\r\nits passion, what is genuine in its pathos, and by the character of\r\nits heroine, Kitty Bell. In the instincts of a dramaturgist both Vigny\r\nand Hugo fell far short of ALEXANDRE DUMAS (1803-70). Before the\r\nbattle of _Hernani_ he had unfolded the romantic banner in his _Henri\r\nIII. et sa Cour_ (1829); it dazzled by its theatrical inventions,\r\nits striking situations, its ever-changing display of the stage\r\nproperties of historical romance. His _Antony_, of two years later,\r\nparent of a numerous progeny, is a domestic tragedy of modern life,\r\nexhaling Byronic passion, misanthropy, crime, with a bastard, a\r\nseducer, a murderer for its hero, and for its ornaments all those\r\natrocities which fascinate a crowd whose nerves can bear to be\r\nagreeably shattered. Something of abounding vitality, of tingling\r\nenergy, of impetuosity, of effrontery, secured a career for _Antony_,\r\nthe _Tour de Nesle_, and his other plays. The trade in horrors lost\r\nits gallant freebooting airs and grew industriously commercial in\r\nthe hands of Frederic Soulie. When in 1843--the year of Hugo's\r\nunsuccessful _Les Burgraves_--a pseudo-classical tragedy, the\r\n_Lucrece_ of Ponsard, was presented on the stage, the enthusiasm was\r\ngreat; youth and romance, if they had not vanished, were less militant\r\nthan in the days of _Hernani_; it seemed as if good sense had returned\r\nto the theatre.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The influence of the great actress Rachel helped to\r\nrestore to favour the classical theatre of Racine and Corneille.]\r\n\r\nCasimir Delavigne (1793-1843) is remembered in lyric poetry by his\r\npatriotic odes, _Les Messeniennes_, suggested by the military\r\ndisasters of France. His dramatic work is noteworthy, less for the\r\nwriter's talent than as indicating the influence of the romantic\r\nmovement in checking the development of classical art. Had he been\r\nfree to follow his natural tendencies, Delavigne would have remained\r\na creditable disciple of Racine; he yielded to the stream, and timidly\r\napproached the romantic leaders in historical tragedy. Once in comedy\r\nhe achieved success; _L'Ecole des Vieillards_ has the originality\r\nof presenting an old husband who is generous in heart, and a young\r\nwife who is good-natured amid her frivolity. Comedy during the second\r\nquarter of the century had a busy ephemeral life. The name of Eugene\r\nScribe, an incessant improvisator during forty years, from 1811\r\nonwards, in comedy, vaudeville, and lyric drama, seems to recall that\r\nof the seventeenth-century Hardy. His art was not all commerce; he\r\nknew and he loved the stage; a philistine writing for philistines,\r\nScribe cared little for truth of character, for beauty of form; the\r\ntheatrical devices became for him ends in themselves; of these he\r\nwas as ingenious a master as is the juggler in another art when he\r\ntosses his bewildering balls, or smiles at the triumph of his\r\ninexplicable surprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\nTHE NOVEL\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe novel in the nineteenth century has yielded itself to every\r\ntendency of the age; it has endeavoured to revive the past, to paint\r\nthe present, to embody a social or political doctrine, to express\r\nprivate and personal sentiment, to analyse the processes of the heart,\r\nto idealise life in the magic mirror of the imagination. The\r\nliterature of prose fiction produced by writers who felt the influence\r\nof the romantic movement tended on the one hand towards lyrism, the\r\npassionate utterance of individual emotion--George Sand's early\r\ntales are conspicuous examples; on the other hand it turned to history,\r\nseeking to effect a living and coloured evocation of former ages.\r\nThe most impressive of these evocations was assuredly Hugo's\r\n_Notre-Dame de Paris_. It was not the earliest; Vigny's _Cinq-Mars_\r\npreceded _Notre-Dame_ by five years. The writer had laboriously\r\nmastered those details which help to make up the romantic _mise en\r\nscene_; but he sought less to interpret historical truth by the\r\nimagination than to employ the material of history as a vehicle for\r\nwhat he conceived to be ideal truth. In Merimee's _Chronique de\r\nCharles IX._ (1829), which also preceded Hugo's romance, the\r\nhistorical, or, if not this, the archaeological spirit is present;\r\nit skilfully sets a tale of the imagination in a framework of history.\r\n\r\nHugo's narratives are eminent by virtue of his imagination as a poet;\r\nthey are lyrical, dramatic, epic; as a reconstitution of history their\r\nvalue is little or is none. The historical novel fell into the hands\r\nof Alexandre Dumas. No one can deny the brilliance, the animation,\r\nthe bustle, the audacity, the inexhaustible invention of _Les Trois\r\nMousquetaires_ and its high-spirited fellows. There were times when\r\nno company was so inspiriting to us as that of the gallant Athos,\r\nPorthos, and Aramis. Let the critics assure us that Dumas' history\r\nis untrue, his characters superficial, his action incredible; we\r\nadmit it, and we are caught again by the flash of life, the fanfaronade\r\nof adventure. We throw Eugene Sue to the critics that we may save\r\nAlexandre Dumas. But Dumas' brain worked faster than his hand--or\r\nany human hand--could obey its orders; the mine of his inventive\r\nfaculty needed a commercial company and an army of diggers for its\r\nexploitation. He constituted himself the managing director of this\r\ncompany; twelve hundred volumes are said to have been the output of\r\nthe chief and his subordinates; the work ceased to be literature,\r\nand became mere commerce. The money that Dumas accumulated he\r\nrecklessly squandered. Half genius, half charlatan, his genius\r\ndecayed, and his charlatanry grew to enormous proportions. Protected\r\nby his son, he died a poor man amid the disasters of the\r\nFranco-Prussian war.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nHENRI BEYLE, who wrote under the pseudonym of Stendhal, not popular\r\namong his contemporaries, though winning the admiration of Merimee\r\nand the praise of Balzac, predicted that he would be understood about\r\n1880. If to be studied and admired is to be understood, the prediction\r\nhas been fulfilled. Taine pronounced him the greatest psychologist\r\nof the century; M. Zola, doing violence to facts, claimed him as a\r\nliterary ancestor; M. Bourget discovered in him the author of a\r\nnineteenth-century Bible and a founder of cosmopolitanism in letters.\r\nDuring his lifetime Beyle was isolated, and had a pride in isolation.\r\nBorn at Grenoble in 1783, he had learnt, during an unhappy childhood,\r\nto conceal his natural sensibility; in later years this reserve was\r\npushed to affectation. He served under Napoleon with coolness and\r\nenergy; he hated the Restoration, and, a lover of Italian manners\r\nand Italian music, he chose Milan for his place of abode. The\r\neighteenth-century materialists were the masters of his intellect;\r\n\"the only excuse for God,\" he declared, \"is that he does not exist\";\r\nin man he saw a being whose end is pleasure, whose law is egoism,\r\nand who affords a curious field for studying the dynamics of the\r\npassions. He honoured Napoleon as an incarnation of force, the\r\ngreatest of the _condottieri_. He loved the Italian character because\r\nthe passions in Italy manifest themselves with the sudden outbreaks\r\nof nature. He indulged his own passions as a refuge from ennui, and\r\nturned the scrutiny of his intelligence upon every operation of his\r\nheart. Fearing to be duped, he became the dupe of his own philosophy.\r\nHe aided the romantic movement by the paradox that all the true\r\nclassical writers were romantic in their own day--they sought to\r\nplease their time; the pseudo-classical writers attempt to maintain\r\na lifeless tradition. But he had little in common with the romantic\r\nschool, except a love for Shakespeare, a certain feeling for local\r\ncolour, and an interest in the study of passion; the effusion and\r\nexaltation of romance repelled him; he laboured to be \"dry,\" and often\r\nsucceeded to perfection.\r\n\r\nHis analytical study _De l'Amour_, resting on a sensual basis, has\r\nall the depth and penetration which is possible to a shallow\r\nphilosophy. His notes on travel and art anticipate in an informal\r\nway the method of criticism which became a system in the hands of\r\nTaine; in a line, in a phrase, he resolves the artist into the\r\nresultant of environing forces. His novels are studies in the\r\nmechanics of the passions and the will. Human energy, which had a\r\nhappy outlet in the Napoleonic wars, must seek a new career in\r\nRestoration days. Julien Sorel, the low-born hero of _Le Rouge et\r\nle Noir_, finding the red coat impossible, must don the priestly black\r\nas a cloak for his ambition. Hypocrite, seducer, and assassin, he\r\nends his career under the knife of the guillotine. _La Chartreuse\r\nde Parme_ exhibits the manners, characters, intrigues of\r\nnineteenth-century Italy, with a remarkable episode which gives a\r\nsoldier's experiences of the field of Waterloo. In the artist's\r\nplastic power Beyle was wholly wanting; a collection of ingenious\r\nobservations in psychology may be of rare value, but it does not\r\nconstitute a work of art. His writings are a whetstone for the\r\nintelligence, but we must bring intelligence to its use, else it will\r\ngrind down or break the blade. In 1842 he died, desiring to perpetuate\r\nhis expatriation by the epitaph which names him Arrigo Beyle Milanese.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nLyrical and idealistic are epithets which a critic is tempted to affix\r\nto the novels of George Sand; but from her early lyrical manner she\r\nadvanced to perfect idyllic narrative; and while she idealised, she\r\nobserved, incorporating in her best work the results of a patient\r\nand faithful study of reality. A vaguer word may be applied to whatever\r\nshe wrote; offspring of her idealism or her realism, it is always\r\nin a true sense poetic.\r\n\r\nLUCILE-AURORE DUPIN, a descendant of Marshal Saxe, was born in Paris\r\nin 1804, the daughter of Lieutenant Dupin and a mother of humble\r\norigin--a child at once of the aristocracy and of the people. Her\r\nearly years were passed in Berri, at the country-house of her\r\ngrandmother. Strong, calm, ruminating, bovine in temperament, she\r\nhad a large heart and an ardent imagination. The woods, the flowers,\r\nthe pastoral heights and hollows, the furrows of the fields, the\r\nlittle peasants, the hemp-dressers of the farm, their processes of\r\nlife, their store of old tales and rural superstitions made up her\r\nearliest education. Already endless stories shaped themselves in her\r\nbrain. At thirteen she was sent to be educated in a Paris convent;\r\nfrom the boisterous moods which seclusion encouraged, she sank of\r\na sudden into depths of religious reverie, or rose to heights of\r\nreligious exaltation, not to be forgotten when afterwards she wrote\r\n_Spiridion_. The country cooled her devout ardour; she read widely,\r\npoets, historians, philosophers, without method and with boundless\r\ndelight; the _Genie du Christianisme_ replaced the _Imitation_;\r\nRousseau and Byron followed Chateaubriand, and romance in her heart\r\nput on the form of melancholy. At eighteen the passive Aurore was\r\nmarried to M. Dudevant, whose worst fault was the absence of those\r\nqualities of heart and brain which make wedded union a happiness.\r\nTwo children were born; and having obtained her freedom and a scanty\r\nallowance, Madame Dudevant in 1831, in possession of her son and\r\ndaughter, resolved upon trying to obtain a livelihood in the capital.\r\n\r\nPerhaps she could paint birds and flowers on cigar-cases and\r\nsnuff-boxes; happily her hopes received small encouragement. Perhaps\r\nshe could succeed in journalism under her friend Delatouche; she\r\nproved wholly wanting in cleverness; her imagination had wings; it\r\ncould not hop on the perch; before she had begun the beginning of\r\nan article the column must end. With her compatriot Jules Sandeau,\r\nshe attempted a novel--_Rose et Blanche_. \"Sand\" and Sandeau were\r\nfraternal names; a countryman of Berri was traditionally George.\r\nHenceforth the young Bohemian, who traversed the _quais_ and streets\r\nin masculine garb, should be GEORGE SAND.\r\n\r\nTo write novels was to her only a process of nature; she seated herself\r\nbefore her table at ten o'clock, with scarcely a plot, and only the\r\nslightest acquaintance with her characters; until five in the evening,\r\nwhile her hand guided a pen, the novel wrote itself. Next day and\r\nthe next it was the same. By-and-by the novel had written itself in\r\nfull, and another was unfolding. Not that she composed mechanically;\r\nher stories were not manufactured; they grew--grew with facility and\r\nin free abundance. At first, a disciple of Rousseau and Chateaubriand,\r\nher theme was the romance of love. In _Indiana_, _Valentine_, _Lelia_,\r\n_Jacques_, she vindicated the supposed rights of passion. These\r\nnovels are lyrical cries of a heart that had been wounded; protests\r\nagainst the crime of loveless marriage, against the tyranny of man,\r\nthe servitude of woman; pleas for the individualism of the\r\nsoul--superficial in thought, ill-balanced in feeling, unequal in\r\nstyle, yet rising to passages of rare poetic beauty, and often\r\nadmirable in descriptive power. The imagination of George Sand had\r\ntranslated her private experiences into romance; yet she, the\r\nspectator of her own inventions, possessed of a fund of sanity which\r\nunderlay the agitations of her genius, while she lent herself to her\r\ncreations, plied her pen with a steady hand from day to day. Unwise\r\nand blameful in conduct she might be for a season; she wronged her\r\nown life, and helped to ruin the life of Musset, who had neither her\r\ndiscretion nor her years; but when the inevitable rupture came she\r\ncould return to her better self.\r\n\r\nThrough _Andre_, _Simon_, _Mauprat_--the last a tale of love subduing\r\nand purifying the savage instincts in man--her art advanced in\r\nsureness and in strength. Singularly accessible to external\r\ninfluences, singularly receptive of ideas, the full significance and\r\nrelations of which she failed to comprehend, she felt the force of\r\nintelligences stronger than her own--of Lamennais, of Ledru-Rollin,\r\nof Jean Raynaud, of Pierre Leroux. Mystical religious sentiment, an\r\nardent enthusiasm of humanity, mingled in her mind with all the\r\ndiscordant formulas of socialism. From 1840 to 1848 her love and large\r\ngenerosity of nature found satisfaction in the ideals and the hopes\r\nof social reform. Her novels _Consuelo_, _Jeanne_, _Le Meunier\r\nd'Angibault_, _Le Peche de M. Antoine_, become expositions of a thesis,\r\nor are diverted from their true development to advocate a cause. The\r\nart suffers. _Jeanne_, so admirable in its rural heroine, wanders\r\nfrom nature to humanitarian symbolism; _Consuelo_, in which the\r\nwriter studies so happily the artistic temperament, too often loses\r\nitself in a confusion of ill-understood ideas and tedious declamation.\r\nBut the gain of escape from the egoism of passion to a more\r\ndisinterested, even if a doctrinaire, view of life was great. George\r\nSand was finding her way.\r\n\r\nIndeed, while writing novels in this her second manner, she had found\r\nher way; her third manner was attained before the second had lost\r\nits attraction. _La Mare au Diable_ belongs to the year 1846; _La\r\nPetite Fadette_, to the year of Revolution, 1848, which George Sand,\r\never an optimist, hailed with joy; _Francois le Champi_ is but two\r\nyears later. In these delightful tales she returns from humanitarian\r\ntheories to the fields of Berri, to humble walks, and to the huts\r\nwhere poor men lie. The genuine idyll of French peasant life was new\r\nto French literature; the better soul of rural France, George Sand\r\nfound deep within herself; she had read the external circumstances\r\nand incidents of country life with an eye as faithful in observation\r\nas that of any student who dignifies his collection of human documents\r\nwith the style and title of realism in art; with a sense of beauty\r\nand the instincts of affection she merged herself in what she saw;\r\nher feeling for nature is realised in gracious art, and her art seems\r\nitself to be nature.\r\n\r\nIn the novels of her latest years she moved from Berri to other regions\r\nof France, and interpreted aristocratic together with peasant life.\r\nOld, experienced, infinitely good and attaching, she has tales for\r\nher grandchildren, and romances--_Jean de la Roche_, _Le Marquis de\r\nVillemer_, and the rest--for her other grandchildren the public. The\r\nsoul of the peasant, of the artist, of the man who must lean upon\r\na stronger woman's arm, of the girl--neither child nor fully\r\nadult--she entered into with deepest and truest sympathy. The simple,\r\naustere, stoical, heroic man she admired as one above her. Her style\r\nat its best, flowing without impetuosity, full and pure without\r\ncommotion, harmonious without complex involutions, can mirror beauty\r\nas faithfully and as magically as an inland river. \"Calme, toujours\r\nplus calme,\" was a frequent utterance of her declining years. \"Ne\r\ndetruisez pas la verdure\" were her latest words. In 1876 George Sand\r\ndied. Her memoirs and her correspondence make us intimate with a\r\nspirit, amid all its errors, sweet, generous, and gaining through\r\nexperience a wisdom for the season of old age.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nGeorge Sand may be described as an \"idealist,\" if we add the words\r\n\"with a remarkable gift for observation.\" Her great contemporary\r\nHONORE DE BALZAC is named a realist, but he was a realist haunted\r\nor attacked by phantasms and nightmares of romance. Born in 1799 at\r\nTours, son of an advocate turned military commissariat-agent, Honore\r\nde Balzac, after some training in the law, resolved to write, and,\r\nif possible, not to starve. With his robust frame, his resolute will,\r\nmanifest in a face coarsely powerful, his large good-nature, his large\r\negoism, his audacity of brain, it seemed as if he might shoulder his\r\nway through the crowd to fortune and to fame. But fortune and fame\r\nwere hard to come at. His tragedy _Cromwell_ was condemned by all\r\nwho saw the manuscript; his novels were published, and lie deep in\r\ntheir refuge under the waters of oblivion. He tried the trades of\r\npublisher, printer, type-founder, and succeeded in encumbering\r\nhimself with debt. At length in 1829 _Le Dernier Chouan_, a\r\nhalf-historical tale of Brittany in 1800, not uninfluenced by Scott,\r\nwas received with a measure of favour.\r\n\r\nNext year Balzac found his truer self, overlaid with journalism,\r\npamphleteering, and miscellaneous writing, in a Dutch painting of\r\nbourgeois life, _Le Maison du Chatqui-pelote_, which relates the\r\nsorrows of the draper's daughter, Augustine, drawn from her native\r\nsphere by an artist's love. From the day that Balzac began to wield\r\nhis pen with power to the day, in 1850, when he died, exhausted by\r\nthe passion of his brain, his own life was concentrated in that of\r\nthe creatures of his imagination. He had friends, and married one\r\nof the oldest of them, Madame Hanska, shortly before his death.\r\nSometimes for a little while he wandered away from his desk. More\r\nthan once he made wild attempts to secure wealth by commercial\r\nenterprise or speculation. These were adventures or incidents of his\r\nexistence. That existence itself is summed up in the volumes of his\r\n_Human Comedy_. He wrote with desperate resolve and a violence of\r\nimagination; he attacked the printer's proof as if it were crude\r\nmaterial on which to work. At six in the evening he retired to sleep;\r\nhe rose at the noon of night, urged on his brain with cups of coffee,\r\nand covered page after page of manuscript, until the noon of day\r\nreleased him. So it went on for nearly twenty years, until the\r\nintemperance of toil had worn the strong man out.\r\n\r\nThere is something gross in Balzac's genius; he has little wit, little\r\ndelicacy, no sense of measure, no fine self-criticism, no lightness\r\nof touch, small insight into the life of refined society, an imperfect\r\nsense of natural beauty, a readiness to accept vulgar marvels as the\r\nequivalent of spiritual mysteries; he is monarchical without the\r\nsentiment of chivalric loyalty, a Catholic without the sentiment of\r\nreligion; he piles sentence on sentence, hard and heavy as the\r\naccumulated stones of a cairn. Did he love his art for its own sake?\r\nIt must have been so; but he esteemed it also as an implement of power,\r\nas the means of pushing towards fame and grasping gold.\r\n\r\nWithin the gross body of his genius, however, an intense flame burnt.\r\nHe had a vivid sense of life, a perception of all that can be seen\r\nand handled, an eager interest in reality, a vast passion for _things_,\r\nan inexhaustible curiosity about the machinery of society, a feeling,\r\nexultant or cynical, of the battle of existence, of the conflict for\r\nwealth and power, with its triumphs and defeats, its display of fierce\r\nvolition, its pushing aside of the feeble, its trampling of the fallen,\r\nits grandeur, its meanness, its obscure heroisms, and the cruelties\r\nof its pathos. He flung himself on the life of society with a desperate\r\nenergy of inspection, and tried to make the vast array surrender to\r\nhis imagination. And across his vision of reality shot strange beams\r\nand shafts of romantic illumination--sometimes vulgar theatrical\r\nlights, sometimes gleams like those which add a new reality of wonder\r\nto the etchings of Rembrandt. What he saw with the eyes of the senses\r\nor those of the imagination he could evoke without the loss of any\r\nfragment of its life, and could transfer it to the brain of his reader\r\nas a vision from which escape is impossible.\r\n\r\nThe higher world of aristocratic refinement, the grace and natural\r\ndelicacy of virginal souls, in general eluded Balzac's observation.\r\nHe found it hard to imagine a lady; still harder--though he tried\r\nand half succeeded--to conceive the mystery of a young girl's mind,\r\nin which the airs of morning are nimble and sweet. The gross bourgeois\r\nworld, which he detested, and a world yet humbler were his special\r\nsphere. He studied its various elements in their environment; a street,\r\na house, a chamber is as much to him as a human being, for it is part\r\nof the creature's shell, shaped to its uses, corresponding to its\r\nnature, limiting its action. He has created a population of persons\r\nwhich numbers two thousand. Where Balzac does not fail, each of these\r\nis a complete individual; in the prominent figures a controlling\r\npassion is the centre of moral life--the greed of money, the desire\r\nfor distinction, the lust for power, some instinct or mania of animal\r\naffection. The individual exists in a group; power circulates from\r\ninanimate objects to the living actors of his tale; the environment\r\nis an accomplice in the action; power circulates from member to member\r\nof the group; finally, group and group enter into correspondence or\r\nconflict; and still above the turmoil is heard the groundswell of\r\nthe tide of Paris.\r\n\r\nThe change from the Renes and Obermanns of melancholy romance was\r\ngreat. But in the government of Louis-Philippe the bourgeoisie\r\ntriumphed; and Balzac hated the bourgeoisie. From 1830 to 1840 were\r\nhis greatest years, which include the _Peau de Chagrin_, _Eugenie\r\nGrandet_, _La Recherche de l'Absolu_, _Le Pere Goriot_, and other\r\nmasterpieces. To name their titles would be to recite a Homeric\r\ncatalogue. At an early date Balzac conceived the idea of connecting\r\nhis tales in groups. They acquired their collective title, _La Comedie\r\nHumaine_, in 1842. He would exhibit human documents illustrating the\r\nwhole social life of his time; \"the administration, the church, the\r\narmy, the judicature, the aristocracy, the bourgeoisie, the\r\nproletariat, the peasantry, the artists, the journalists, the men\r\nof letters, the actors, ... the shopkeepers of every degree, the\r\ncriminals,\" should all appear in his vast tableau of society. His\r\nrecord should include scenes from private life, scenes from Parisian,\r\nprovincial, political, military, rural life, with philosophical\r\nstudies in narrative and analytic treatises on the passions. The\r\nspirit of system took hold upon Balzac; he had, in common with Victor\r\nHugo, a gift for imposing upon himself with the charlatanry of\r\npseudo-ideas; to observe, to analyse, to evoke with his imagination\r\nwas not enough; he also would be among the philosophers--and Balzac's\r\nphilosophy is often pretentious and vulgar, it is often banal. Outside\r\nthe general scheme of the human comedy lie his unsuccessful attempts\r\nfor the theatre, and the _Contes Drolatiques_, in which the\r\npseudo-antique Rabelaisian manner and the affluent power do not\r\nentirely atone for the anachronism of a grossness more natural in\r\nthe sixteenth than in the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nWas it possible to be romantic without being lyrical? Was it possible\r\nto produce purely objective work, reserving one's own personality,\r\nand glancing at one's audience only with an occasional look of\r\nsuperior irony? Such was the task essayed by PROSPER MERIMEE (1803-70).\r\nWith some points of resemblance in character to Beyle, whose ideas\r\nwere influential on his mind, Merimee possessed the plastic\r\nimagination and the craftsman's skill, in which Beyle was deficient.\r\n\"He is a gentleman,\" said Cousin, and the words might serve for\r\nMerimee's epitaph; a gentleman not of nature's making, or God\r\nAlmighty's kind, but constructed in faultless bearing according to\r\nthe rules. Such a gentleman must betray no sensibility, must express\r\nno sentiment, must indulge no enthusiasm, must attach himself to no\r\nfaith, must be superior to all human infirmities, except the infirmity\r\nof a pose which is impressive only by its correctness; he may be\r\ncynical, if the cynicism is wholly free from emphasis; he may be\r\nironical, if the irony is sufficiently disguised; he may mystify his\r\nfellows, if he keeps the pleasure of mystification for his private\r\namusement. Should he happen to be an artist, he must appear to be\r\nonly a dilettante. He must never incur ridicule, and yet his whole\r\nattitude may be ridiculous.\r\n\r\nSuch a gentleman was Prosper Merimee. He had the gift of imagination,\r\npsychological insight, the artist's shaping hand. His early romantic\r\nplays were put forth as those of Clara Gazul, a Spanish _comedienne_.\r\nHis Illyrian poems, _La Guzla_, were the work of an imaginary\r\nHyacinthe Maglanovich, and Merimee could smile gently at the\r\ncredulity of a learned public. He took up the short story where Xavier\r\nde Maistre, who had known how to be both pathetic and amiably humorous,\r\nand Charles Nodier, who had given play to a graceful fantasy, left\r\nit. He purged it of sentiment, he reduced fantasy to the law of the\r\nimagination, and produced such works as _Carmen_ and _Colomba_, each\r\none a little masterpiece of psychological truth, of temperate local\r\ncolour, of faultless narrative, of pure objective art. The public\r\nmust not suppose that he cares for his characters or what befell them;\r\nhe is an archaeologist, a savant, and only by accident a teller of\r\ntales. Merimee had more sensibility than he would confess; it shows\r\nitself for moments in the posthumous _Lettres a une Inconnue_; but\r\nhe has always a bearing-rein of ironical pessimism to hold his\r\nsensibility in check. The egoism of the romantic school appears in\r\nMerimee inverted; it is the egoism not of effusion but of disdainful\r\nreserve.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It is one of Merimee's merits that he awakened in France\r\nan interest in Russian literature.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\nHISTORY--LITERARY CRITICISM\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe progress of historical literature in the nineteenth century was\r\naided by the change which had taken place in philosophical opinion;\r\ninstead of a rigid system of abstract ideas, which disdained the\r\nthought of past ages as superstition, had come an eclecticism guided\r\nby spiritual beliefs. The religions of various lands and various ages\r\nwere viewed with sympathetic interest; the breach of continuity from\r\nmediaeval to modern times was repaired; the revolutionary spirit of\r\nindividualism gave way before a broader concern for society; the\r\ntemper in politics grew more cautious and less dogmatic; the great\r\nevents of recent years engendered historical reflection; literary\r\nart was renewed by the awakening of the romantic imagination.\r\n\r\nThe historical learning of the Empire is represented by Daunou, an\r\nexplorer in French literature; by Ginguene, the literary historian\r\nof Italy; by Michaud, who devoted his best years to a _History of\r\nthe Crusades_. In his _De la Religion_ (1824-31) Benjamin Constant,\r\nin Restoration days, traced the progress of the religious sentiment,\r\ncleaving its way through dogma and ordinance to a free and full\r\ndevelopment. Sismondi (1773-1842), in his _Histoire des Francais_,\r\ninvestigated such sources as were accessible to him, studied economic\r\nfacts, and in a liberal spirit exhibited the life of the nation, and\r\nnot merely the acts of monarchs or the intrigues of statesmen. His\r\nwide, though not profound, erudition comprehended Italy as well as\r\nFrance; the _Histoire des Republiques Italiennes_ is the chart of\r\na difficult labyrinth. The method of disinterested narrative, which\r\nabstains from ethical judgments, propounds no thesis, and aims at\r\nno doctrinaire conclusion, was followed by Barante in his _Histoire\r\ndes Ducs de Bourgogne_. The precept of Quintilian expresses his rule:\r\n\"Scribitur ad narrandum, non ad probandum.\"\r\n\r\nEach school of nineteenth-century thought has had its historical\r\nexponents. Liberal Catholicism is represented by Montalembert,\r\nOzanam, De Broglie; socialism, by Louis Blanc; a patriotic Caesarism,\r\nby Thiers; the democratic school, by Michelet and Quinet; philosophic\r\nliberalism, by Guizot, Mignet, and Tocqueville.\r\n\r\nAUGUSTIN THIERRY (1795-1856) nobly led the way. Some pages of\r\nChateaubriand, full of the sentiment of the past, were his first\r\ninspiration; at a later time the influence of Fauriel and the novels\r\nof Walter Scott, \"the master of historical divination,\" confirmed\r\nhim in his sense of the uses of imagination as an aid to the scholarship\r\nof history. For a time he acted as secretary to Saint-Simon, and under\r\nhis influence proposed a scheme for a community of European peoples\r\nwhich should leave intact the nationality of each. Then he parted\r\nfrom his master, to pursue his way in independence. It seemed to him\r\nthat the social condition and the revolutions of modern Europe had\r\ntheir origins in the Germanic invasions, and especially in the Norman\r\nConquest of England. As he read the great collection of the original\r\nhistorians of France and Gaul, he grew indignant against the modern\r\ntravesties named history, indignant against writers without\r\nerudition, who could not see, and writers without imagination, who\r\ncould not depict. The conflict of races--Saxons and Normans in England,\r\nGauls and Franks in his own country--remained with him as a dominant\r\nidea, but he would not lose himself in generalisations; he would\r\ninvolve the abstract in concrete details; he would see, and he would\r\ndepict. There was much philosophy in abstaining from philosophy\r\novermuch. The _Lettres sur l'Histoire de France_ were followed in\r\n1825 by the _Histoire de la Conquete de l'Angleterre_, in which the\r\nart of historiography attained a perfection previously unknown.\r\nThrough charter and chronicle, Thierry had reached the spirit of the\r\npast. He had prophesied upon the dry bones and to the wind, and the\r\ndry bones lived. As a liberal, he had been interested in contemporary\r\npolitics. His political ardour had given him that historical\r\nperspicacity which enabled him to discover the soul behind an ancient\r\ntext.\r\n\r\nIn 1826 Thierry, the martyr of his passionate studies, suffered the\r\ncalamity of blindness. With the aid of his distinguished brother,\r\nof friends, and secretaries--above all, with the aid of the devoted\r\nwoman who became his wife, he pursued his work. The _Recits des Temps\r\nMerovingiens_ and the _Essai sur l'Histoire de la Formation du Tiers\r\nEtat_ were the labours of a sightless scholar. His passion for\r\nperfection was greater than ever; twenty, fifteen lines a day\r\ncontented him, if his idea was rendered clear and enduring in\r\nfaultless form. Paralysis made its steady advance; still he kept his\r\nintellect above his infirmities, and followed truth and beauty. On\r\nMay 22, 1856, he woke his attendant at four in the morning, and\r\ndictated with laboured speech the alteration of a phrase for the\r\nrevised _Conquete_. On the same day, \"insatiable of perfection,\"\r\nThierry died. He is not, either in substance, thought, or style, the\r\ngreatest of modern French historians; but, more than any other, he\r\nwas an initiator.\r\n\r\nThe life of FRANCOIS GUIZOT--great and venerable name--is a portion\r\nof the history of his country. Born at Nimes in 1787, of an honourable\r\nProtestant family, he died, with a verse of his favourite Corneille\r\nor a text of Scripture on his lips, in 1874. Austere without severity,\r\nsimple in habit without rudeness, indomitable in courage, imperious\r\nin will, gravely eloquent, he had at once the liberality and the\r\nnarrowness of the middle classes, which he represented when in power.\r\nA threefold task, as he conceived, lies before the historian: he must\r\nascertain facts; he must co-ordinate these facts under laws, studying\r\nthe anatomy and the physiology of society; finally, he must present\r\nthe external physiognomy of the facts. Guizot was not endowed with\r\nthe artist's imagination; he had no sense of life, of colour, of\r\nliterary style; he was a thinker, who saw the life of the past through\r\nthe medium of ideas; he does not in his pages evoke a world of animated\r\nforms, of passionate hearts, of vivid incidents; he distinguishes\r\nsocial forces, with a view to arrive at principles; he considers those\r\nforces in their play one upon another.\r\n\r\nThe _Histoire Generale de la Civilisation en Europe_ and the _Histoire\r\nde la Civilisation en France_ consist of lectures delivered from 1828\r\nto 1830 at the Sorbonne.[1] Guizot recognised that the study of\r\ninstitutions must be preceded by a study of the society which has\r\ngiven them birth. In the progress of civilisation he saw not merely\r\nthe development of communities, but also that of the individual. The\r\ncivilisation of Europe, he held, was most intelligibly exhibited in\r\nthat of France, where, more than in other countries, intellectual\r\nand social development have moved hand in hand, where general ideas\r\nand doctrines have always accompanied great events and public\r\nrevolutions. The key to the meaning of French history he found in\r\nthe tendency towards national and political unity. From the tenth\r\nto the fourteenth century four great forces met in co-operation or\r\nin conflict--royalty, the feudal system, the communes, the Church.\r\nFeudalism fell; a great monarchy arose upon its ruins. The human mind\r\nasserted its spiritual independence in the Protestant reformation.\r\nThe _tiers etat_ was constantly advancing in strength. The power of\r\nthe monarchy, dominant in the seventeenth century, declined in the\r\ncentury that followed; the power of the people increased. In modern\r\nsociety the elements of national life are reduced to two--the\r\ngovernment on the one hand, the people on the other; how to harmonise\r\nthese elements is the problem of modern politics. As a capital example\r\nfor the French bourgeoisie, Guizot, returning to an early work, made\r\na special study of the great English revolution of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. In Germany, of the preceding century, the revolution was\r\nreligious and not political. In France, of the succeeding century,\r\nthe revolution was political and not religious. The rare good fortune\r\nof England lay in the fact that the spirit of religious faith and\r\nthe spirit of political freedom ruled together, and co-operated\r\ntowards a common result.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The _History of Civilisation in France_ closes with the\r\nfourteenth century.]\r\n\r\nThe work of FRANCOIS MIGNET (1796-1884), eminent for its research,\r\nexactitude, clearness, ordonnance, has been censured for its\r\nhistorical fatalism. In reality Mignet's mind was too studious of\r\nfacts to be dominated by a theory. He recognised the great forces\r\nwhich guide and control events; he recognised also the power and\r\nfreedom of the individual will. His early _Histoire de la Revolution\r\nFrancaise_ is a sane and lucid arrangement of material that came to\r\nhis hands in chaotic masses. His later and more important writings\r\ndeal with his special province, the sixteenth century; his method,\r\nas he advanced, grew more completely objective; we discern his ideas\r\nthrough the lines of a well-proportioned architecture.\r\n\r\nThe analytic method of Guizot, supported by a method of patient\r\ninduction, was applied by ALEXIS DE TOCQUEVILLE (1805-59) to the study\r\nof the great phenomenon of modern democracy. Limiting the area of\r\ninvestigation to America, which he had visited on a public mission,\r\nhe investigated the political organisation, the manners and morals,\r\nthe ideas, the habits of thought and feeling of the United States\r\nas influenced by the democratic equality of conditions. He wrote as\r\na liberal in whom the spirit of individualism was active. He regarded\r\nthe progress of democracy in the modern world as inevitable; he\r\nperceived the dangers--formidable for society and for individual\r\ncharacter--which accompany that progress; he believed that by\r\nforesight and wise ordering many of the dangers could be averted.\r\nThe fears and hopes of the citizen guided and sustained in Tocqueville\r\na philosophical intelligence. Turning from America to France, he\r\ndesigned to disengage from the tangle of events the true historical\r\nsignificance of the Revolution. Only one volume, _L'Ancien Regime\r\net la Revolution_, was accomplished. It can stand alone as a work\r\nof capital importance. In the great upheaval he saw that all was not\r\nprogress; the centralisation of power under the old regime remained,\r\nand was rendered even more formidable than before; the sentiment of\r\nequality continued to advance in its inevitable career; unhappily\r\nthe spirit of liberty was not always its companion, its moderator,\r\nor its guide.\r\n\r\nADOLPHE THIERS (1797-1877) was engaged at the same time as Mignet,\r\nhis lifelong friend, upon a history of the French Revolution (1823-27).\r\nThe same liberal principles were held in common by the young authors.\r\nTheir methods differed widely: Mignet's orderly and compact\r\nnarration was luminous through its skilful arrangement; Thiers'\r\n_Histoire_ was copious, facile, brilliant, more just in its general\r\nconception than exact in statement, a plea for revolutionary\r\npatriotism as against the royalist reaction of the day, and not\r\nwithout influence in preparing the spirit of the country for the\r\napproaching Revolution of July. His _Histoire du Consulat et de\r\nl'Empire_ (1845-62) is the great achievement of Thiers' maturity;\r\njournalist, orator, minister of state, until he became the chief of\r\nstricken France in 1871 his highest claim to be remembered was this\r\nvast record of his country's glory. He had an appetite for facts;\r\nno detail--the price of bread, of soap, of candles--was a matter of\r\nindifference to him; he could not show too many things, or show them\r\ntoo clearly; his supreme quality was intelligence; his passion was\r\nthe pride of patriotism; his foible was the vanity of military success,\r\nthe zeal of a chauvinist. He was a liberal; but Napoleon summed up\r\nFrance, and won her battles, therefore Napoleon, the great captain,\r\nwho \"made war with his genius and politics with his passions,\" must\r\nbe for ever magnified. The _coup d'etat_ of the third Napoleon owed\r\na debt to the liberal historian who had reconstructed the Napoleonic\r\nlegend. The campaigns and battle-pieces of Thiers are unsurpassed\r\nin their kind. His style in narrative is facile, abundant, animated,\r\nand so transparent that nothing seems to intervene between the object\r\nand the reader who has become a spectator; a style negligent at times,\r\nand even incorrect, adding no charm of its own to a lucid presentation\r\nof things.\r\n\r\nJULES MICHELET, the greatest imaginative restorer of the past, the\r\ngreatest historical interpreter of the soul of ancient France, was\r\nborn in 1798 in Paris, an infant seemingly too frail and nervous to\r\nremain alive. His early years gave him experience, brave and pathetic,\r\nof the hardships of the poor. His father, an unsuccessful printer,\r\noften found it difficult to procure bread or fire for his household;\r\nbut he resolved that his son should receive an education. The boy,\r\nof a fine and sensitive organisation, knew cold and hunger; he watched\r\nhis mother toiling, and from day to day declining in health. Two\r\nsources of consolation he found--the _Imitation_, which told him of\r\na Divine refuge from sorrow, and the Museum of French monuments, which\r\nmade him forget all present distress in visions of the vanished\r\ncenturies. Mocked and persecuted by his schoolfellows, he never lost\r\ncourage, and had the joy of rewarding his parents with the cross won\r\nby his schoolboy theme. In happy country days his aunt Alexis told\r\nhim legendary tales, and read to him the old chroniclers of France.\r\nMichelet's vocation was before long revealed, and its summons was\r\nirresistible.\r\n\r\nIn 1827 he published his earliest works, the _Precis de l'Histoire\r\nModerne_, a modest survey of a wide field, in which genius illuminated\r\nscholarship, and a translation of the _Scienza Nuova_ of Vico, the\r\nmaster who impressed him with the thought that humanity is in a\r\nconstant process of creation under the influence of the Divine ideas.\r\nThe _Histoire Romaine_ and the _Introduction a l'Histoire\r\nUniverselle_ followed; the latter a little book, written with\r\nincredible ardour under the inspiration of the days of July. His\r\nfriend Quinet had taught him to see in history an ever-broadening\r\ncombat for freedom--in Michelet's words, \"an eternal July,\" and the\r\nexposition of this idea was of the nature of a philosophical\r\nentrancement.\r\n\r\nA teacher at the Ecole Normale, appointed chief of the historical\r\nsection of the National Archives in 1831, Guizot's substitute at the\r\nSorbonne in 1833, professor of history and morals at the College de\r\nFrance in 1838, Michelet lived in and for the life of his people and\r\nof his land. The _Histoire de France_, begun in 1830, was completed\r\nthirty-seven years later. After the disasters of the war of 1870-71,\r\nwith failing strength the author resumed his labours, endeavouring\r\nto add, as it were, an appendix on the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nA passionate searcher among original sources, published and\r\nunpublished, handling documents as if they were things of flesh and\r\nblood, seeing the outward forms of existence with the imaginative\r\neye, pressing through these to the soul of each successive epoch,\r\npossessed by an immense pity for the obscure generations of human\r\ntoilers, having, more than almost any other modern writer, Virgil's\r\ngift of tears, ardent in admiration, ardent in indignation, with ideas\r\nimpregnated by emotions, and emotions quickened by ideas, Michelet\r\nset himself to resuscitate the buried past. It seemed to him that\r\nhis eminent predecessors--Guizot, Mignet, Thiers, Thierry--had each\r\nenvisaged history from some special point of view. Each had too little\r\nof the outward body or too little of the inward soul of history.\r\nMichelet dared to hope that a resurrection of the integral life of\r\nthe dead centuries was possible. All or nothing was his word. It was\r\na bold venture, but it was a venture, or rather an act, of faith.\r\nThierry had been tyrannised by the idea of the race: the race is much,\r\nbut the people does not march in the air; it has a geographical basis;\r\nit draws its nutriment from a particular soil. Michelet, at the moment\r\nof his narrative when France began to have a life distinct from Germany,\r\nenters upon a survey of its geography, in which the physiognomy and\r\nthe genius of each region are studied as if each were a separate living\r\ncreature, and the character of France itself is discovered in the\r\ncohesion or the unity of its various parts. Reaching the tenth and\r\neleventh centuries, he feels the sadness of their torpor and their\r\nviolence; yet humanity was living, and soon in the enthusiasm of\r\nGothic art and the enthusiasm of the Crusades the sacred aspirations\r\nof the soul had their manifestation. At the close of the mediaeval\r\nperiod everything seems to droop and decay: no! it was then, during\r\nthe Hundred Years' War, that the national consciousness was born,\r\nand patriotism was incarnated in an armed shepherdess, child of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nBy the thirteenth year of his labours--1843--Michelet had traversed\r\nthe mediaeval epoch, and reached the close of the reign of Louis XI.\r\nThere he paused. Seeing one day high on the tower of Reims Cathedral,\r\nbelow which the kings of France received their consecration, a group\r\nor garland of tortured and mutilated figures carved in stone, the\r\nthought possessed him that the soul and faith of the people should\r\nbe confirmed within his own soul before he could trust himself to\r\ntreat of the age of the great monarchy. He leaped at once the\r\nintervening centuries, and was at work during eight years--from 1845\r\nto 1853--on the French Revolution. He found a hero for his\r\nrevolutionary epic in the people.\r\n\r\nThe temper of 1848 was hardly the temper in which the earlier\r\nRevolution could be judiciously investigated. Michelet and Quinet\r\nhad added to their democratic zeal the passions connected with an\r\nanticlerical campaign. The violence of liberalism was displayed in\r\n_Des Jesuites_, and _Du Pretre, de la Femme et de la Famille_. When\r\nthe historian returned to the sixteenth century his spirit had\r\nundergone a change: he adored the Middle Ages; but was it not the\r\nperiod of the domination of the Church, and how could it be other\r\nthan evil? He could no longer be a mere historian; he must also be\r\na prophet. The volumes which treat of the Reformation, the Renaissance,\r\nthe wars of religion, are as brilliant as earlier volumes, but they\r\nare less balanced and less coherent. The equilibrium between\r\nMichelet's intellect and his imagination, between his ideas and his\r\npassions, was disturbed, if not destroyed.\r\n\r\nMichelet, who had been deprived of his chair in the College de France,\r\nlost also his post in the Archives upon his refusal, in 1852, to swear\r\nallegiance to the Emperor. Near Nantes in his tempest-beaten home,\r\nnear Genoa in a fold of the Apennines, where he watched the lizards\r\nsleep or slide, a great appeasement came upon his spirit. He had\r\ninterpreted the soul of the people; he would now interpret the soul\r\nof humbler kinsfolk--the bird, the insect; he would interpret the\r\ninarticulate soul of the mountain and the sea. He studied other\r\ndocuments--the documents of nature--with a passion of love, read\r\ntheir meanings, and mingled as before his own spirit with theirs.\r\n_L'Oiseau_, _L'Insecte_, _La Mer_, _La Montagne_, are canticles in\r\nprose by a learned lover of the external world, rather than essays\r\nin science; often extravagant in style, often extreme in sentiment,\r\nand uncontrolled in imagination, but always the betrayals of genius.\r\n\r\nMichelet's faults as an historian are great, and such as readily\r\nstrike an English reader. His rash generalisations, his lyrical\r\noutbreaks, his Pindaric excitement, his verbiage assuming the place\r\nof ideas, his romantic excess, his violence in ecclesiastical affairs,\r\nhis hostility to our country, his mysticism touched with sensuality,\r\nhis insistence on physiological details, his quick and irregular\r\nutterance--these trouble at times his imaginative insight, and mar\r\nhis profound science in documents. He died at Hyeres in 1874, hoping\r\nthat God would grant him reunion with his lost ones, and the joys\r\npromised to those who have sought and loved.\r\n\r\nEDGAR QUINET (1803-1875), the friend and brother-in-arms of Michelet\r\nin his attack upon the Jesuits, born at Bourg, of a Catholic father\r\nand a Protestant mother, approached the study of literature and\r\nhistory with that tendency to large _vues d'ensemble_ which was\r\nnatural to his mind, and which had been strengthened by discipleship\r\nto Herder. Happy in temper, sound of conscience, generous of heart,\r\nhe illuminated many subjects, and was a complete master of none. A\r\npoet of lofty intentions, in his _Ahasverus_ (1833)--the wandering\r\nJew, type of humanity in its endless Odyssey--in his _Napoleon_, his\r\n_Promethee_, his vast encyclopaedic allegory _Merlin l'Enchanteur_\r\n(1860), his poetry lacked form, and yielded itself to the rhetoric\r\nof the intellect.\r\n\r\nIn the _Genie des Religions_ Quinet endeavoured to exhibit the\r\nreligious idea as the germinative power of civilisation, giving its\r\nspecial character to the political and social idea. _La Revolution_,\r\nwhich is perhaps his most important work, attempts to replace the\r\nRevolutionary hero-worship, the Girondin and Jacobin legends, by a\r\nfaithful interpretation of the meaning of events. The principles of\r\nmodern society and the principles of the Roman Catholic Church, Quinet\r\nregarded as incapable of conciliation. In the incompetence of the\r\nleaders to perceive and apply this truth, and in the fatal logic of\r\ntheir violent and anarchic methods, lay, as he believed, the causes\r\nof the failure which followed the bright hopes of 1789. In 1848 Quinet\r\nwas upon the barricades; the Empire drove him into exile. In his elder\r\nyears, like Michelet, he found a new delight in the study of nature.\r\n_La Creation_ (1870) exhibits the science of nature and that of human\r\nhistory as presenting the same laws and requiring kindred methods.\r\nIt closes with the prophecy of science that creation is not yet fully\r\naccomplished, and that a nobler race will enter into the heritage\r\nof our humanity.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nLiterary criticism in the eighteenth century had been the criticism\r\nof taste or the criticism of dogma; in the nineteenth century it became\r\nnaturalistic--a natural history of individual minds and their\r\nproducts, a natural history of works of art as formed or modified\r\nby social, political, and moral environments, and by the tendencies\r\nof races. Such criticism must inevitably have followed the growth\r\nof the comparative study of literatures in an age dominated by the\r\nscientific spirit. If we are to name any single writer as its founder,\r\nwe must name Mme. de Stael. The French nation, she explained in\r\n_L'Allemagne_, inclines towards what is classical; the Teutonic\r\nnations incline towards what is romantic. She cares not to say whether\r\nclassical or romantic art should be preferred; it is enough to show\r\nthat the difference of taste results not from accidental causes, but\r\nfrom the primitive sources of imagination and of thought.\r\n\r\nThe historical tendency, proceeding from the eighteenth century,\r\ninfluenced alike the study of philosophy, of politics, and of\r\nliterature. While Cousin gave an historical interpretation of\r\nphilosophy, and Guizot applied history to the exposition of politics,\r\na third eminent professor, ABEL-FRANCOIS VILLEMAIN (1790-1870) was\r\nilluminating literature with the light of history. An accomplished\r\nclassical scholar, a student of English, Italian, and Spanish authors,\r\nVillemain, in his _Tableau de la Litterature au Moyen Age_, and his\r\nmore admirable _Tableau de la Litterature au XVIIIe Siecle_, viewed\r\na wide prospect, and could not apply a narrow rule to the measurement\r\nof all that he saw. He did not formulate a method of criticism; but\r\ninstinctively he directed criticism towards history. He perceived\r\nthe correspondence between literary products and the other phenomena\r\nof the age; he observed the movement in the spirit of a period; he\r\npassed from country to country; he made use of biography as an aid\r\nin the study of letters. His learning was at times defective; his\r\nviews often superficial; he suffered from his desire to entertain\r\nhis audience or to capture them by rhetoric. Yet Villemain served\r\nletters well, and, accepted as a master by the young critics of the\r\n_Globe_, he prepared the way for Sainte-Beuve.\r\n\r\nWhile such criticism as that of Villemain was maintained by Saint-Marc\r\nGirardin (1801-73), professor of French poetry at the Sorbonne, the\r\ndogmatic or doctrinaire school of criticism was represented with rare\r\nability by DESIRE NISARD (1806-88). His capital work, the _Histoire\r\nde la Litterature Francaise_, the labour of many years, is\r\ndistinguished by a magisterial application of ideas to the decision\r\nof literary questions. Criticism with Nisard is not a natural history\r\nof minds, nor a study of historical developments, so much as the\r\njudgment of literary art in the light of reason. He confronts each\r\nbook on which he pronounces judgment with that ideal of its species\r\nwhich he has formed in his own mind: he compares it with the ideal\r\nof the genius of France, which attains its highest ends rather through\r\ndiscipline than through freedom; he compares it with the ideal of\r\nthe French language; finally, he compares it with the ideal of\r\nhumanity as seen in the best literature of the world. According to\r\nthe result of the comparison he delivers condemnation or awards the\r\ncrown. In French literature, at its best, he perceives a marvellous\r\nequilibrium of the faculties under the control of reason; it applies\r\ngeneral ideas to life; it avoids individual caprice; it dreads the\r\nchimeras of imagination; it is eminently rational; it embodies ideas\r\nin just and measured form. Such literature Nisard found in the great\r\nage of Louis XIV. Certain gains there may have been in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, but these gains were more than counterbalanced by losses.\r\nTo disprove the saying that there is no disputing about tastes, to\r\nestablish an order and a hierarchy in letters, to regulate\r\nintellectual pleasures, was Nisard's aim; but in attempting to\r\nconstitute an exact science founded upon general principles, he too\r\noften derived those principles from the attractions and repulsions\r\nof his individual taste. Criticism retrograded in his hands; yet,\r\nin retrograding, it took up a strong position: the influence of such\r\na teacher was not untimely when facile sympathies required the\r\nguidance or the check of a director.\r\n\r\nThe admirable critic of the romantic school, CHARLES-AUGUSTIN\r\nSAINTE-BEUVE (1804-69), developed, as time went on, into the great\r\ncritic of the naturalistic method. In his _Tableau de la Poesie\r\nFrancaise au XVIe Siecle_ he found ancestors for the romantic poets\r\nas much older than the ancestors of classical art in France as Ronsard\r\nis older than Malherbe. Wandering endlessly from author to author\r\nin his _Portraits Litteraires_ and _Portraits Contemporains_, he\r\nstudied in all its details what we may term the physiology of each.\r\nThe long research of spirits connected with his most sustained work,\r\n_Port-Royal_, led him to recognise certain types or families under\r\nwhich the various minds of men can be grouped and classified. During\r\na quarter of a century he investigated, distinguished, defined in\r\nthe vast collection of little monographs which form the _Causeries\r\ndu Lundt_ and the _Nouveaux Lundis_. They formed, as it were, a natural\r\nhistory of intellects and temperaments; they established a new method,\r\nand illustrated that method by a multitude of examples.\r\n\r\nNever was there a more mobile spirit; but he was as exact and\r\nsure-footed as he was mobile. When we have allowed for certain\r\npersonal jealousies or hostilities, and for an excessive attraction\r\ntowards what may be called the morbid anatomy of minds, we may give\r\nour confidence with scarcely a limit to the psychologist critic\r\nSainte-Beuve. Poet, novelist, student of medicine, sceptic, believer,\r\nsocialist, imperialist--he traversed every region of ideas; as soon\r\nas he understood each position he was free to leave it behind. He\r\ndid not pretend to reduce criticism to a science; he hoped that at\r\nlength, as the result of numberless observations, something like a\r\nscience might come into existence. Meanwhile he would cultivate the\r\nrelative and distrust the absolute. He would study literary products\r\nthrough the persons of their authors; he would examine each detail;\r\nhe would inquire into the physical characteristics of the subject\r\nof his investigation; view him through his ancestry and among his\r\nkinsfolk; observe him in the process of education; discover him among\r\nhis friends and contemporaries; note the moment when his genius first\r\nunfolded itself; note the moment when it was first touched with decay;\r\napproach him through admirers and disciples; approach him through\r\nhis antagonists or those whom he repelled; and at last, if that were\r\npossible, find some illuminating word which resumes the results of\r\na completed study. There is no \"code Sainte-Beuve\" by which off-hand\r\nto pronounce literary judgments; a method of Sainte-Beuve there is,\r\nand it is the method which has best served the study of literature\r\nin the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere this survey of a wide field finds its limit. The course of French\r\nliterature since 1850 may be studied in current criticism; it does\r\nnot yet come within the scope of literary history. The product of\r\nthese years has been manifold and great; their literary importance\r\nis attested by the names--among many others--of Leconte de Lisle,\r\nSully Prudhomme, Verlaine, in non-dramatic poetry; of Augier and the\r\nyounger Dumas in the theatre; of Flaubert, Edmond and Jules de\r\nGoncourt, Zola, Daudet, Bourget, Pierre Loti, Anatole France, in\r\nfiction; of Taine and Renan in historical study and criticism; of\r\nFromentin in the criticism of art; of Scherer, Brunetiere, Faguet,\r\nLemaitre, in the criticism of literature.\r\n\r\nThe dominant fact, if we discern it aright, has been the scientific\r\ninfluence, turning poetry from romantic egoism to objective art,\r\ndirecting the novel and the drama to naturalism and to the study of\r\nsocial environments, informing history and criticism with the spirit\r\nof curiosity, and prompting research for laws of evolution. Whether\r\nthe spiritualist tendency observable at the present moment be a\r\nsymptom of languor and fatigue, or the indication of a new moral energy,\r\nfuture years will determine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following notes are designed as an indication of some books which\r\nmay be useful to students.\r\n\r\nOf the many Histories of French Literature the fullest and most\r\ntrustworthy is that at present in course of publication under the\r\neditorship of M. Petit de Julleville, _Histoire de la Langue et de\r\nla Litterature francaise_ (A. Colin et Cie.). M. Lanson's _Histoire\r\nde la Litterature francaise_ should be in the hands of every student,\r\nand this may be supplemented by M. Lintilhac's _Litterature\r\nfrancaise_ (2 vols.).\r\n\r\nThe works of Mr. Saintsbury, Geruzez, Demogeot, are widely known,\r\nand have proved useful during many years. Much may be learnt and learnt\r\npleasantly from Paul Albert's volumes on the literature of the\r\nsixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries. Two\r\nvolumes out of five of M. Charles Gidel's _Histoire de la Litterature\r\nfrancaise_ (Lemerre) are occupied with literature from 1815 to 1886.\r\nM. Hermann Pergamini's _Histoire generale de la Litterature\r\nfrancaise_ (Alcan) sometimes gives fresh and interesting views. For\r\na short school history by an accomplished scholar, none is better\r\nthan M. Petit de Julleville's _Histoire de la Litterature francaise_,\r\nwhich, in 555 pages, packs a great deal of information. The _Histoire\r\nelementaire de la Litterature francaise_, by M. Jean Fleury, has been\r\npopular; it tells much of the contents of great books, and makes no\r\nassumption that the reader is already acquainted with them. Dr.\r\nWarren's _A Primer of French Literature_ (Heath, Boston, U.S.A.) is\r\nwell proportioned and well arranged, but it has room for little more\r\nthan names, dates, and the briefest characterisations. Dr. Wells's\r\n_Modern French Literature_ (Roberts, Boston, U.S.A.) sketches French\r\nliterature to Chateaubriand, and treats with considerable fulness\r\nthe literature from Chateaubriand and Mme. de Stael to the present\r\ntime. For the present century M. G. Pellissier's _Le Mouvement\r\nlitteraire au XIXe Siecle_ is valuable.\r\n\r\nOf elder histories that by Nisard is by far the most distinguished,\r\nthe work of a scholar and a thinker. (See the final section of the\r\npresent volume.)\r\n\r\nThe student will find Merlet's _Etudes litteraires sur les Classiques\r\nfrancais_ (2 vols.), revised and enlarged by M. Lintilhac, highly\r\ninstructive; the second volume is wholly occupied with Corneille,\r\nRacine, and Moliere.\r\n\r\nFor the history of the French theatre the best introduction is M.\r\nPetit de Julleville's _Le Theatre en France_; it may be supplemented\r\nby M. Brunetiere's _Les Epoques du Theatre francais_. Learning wide\r\nand exact, and original thought, characterise all the work of M.\r\nBrunetiere; each of his many volumes should be searched by the student\r\nfor what he may need. The studies of M. Faguet on the writers of the\r\nsixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries are the\r\nwork of a critic who is penetrating in his psychological study of\r\nauthors, and who, just or unjust, is always suggestive. For numberless\r\nlittle monographs the student may turn to Sainte-Beuve. Monographs\r\non a larger scale will be found in the admirable series of _Grands\r\nEcrivains francais_ (Hachette); the _Classiques populaires_ (Lecene,\r\nOudin et Cie.) are in some instances no less scholarly. The writings\r\nof Scherer, of M. Jules Lemaitre, and of M. Anatole France are\r\nespecially valuable on nineteenth-century literature. The best study\r\nof French historical literature is Professor Flint's _The Philosophy\r\nof History_ (1893).\r\n\r\nProvided with such books as these the student will hardly need the\r\ngeneral histories of French literature by German writers. I may name\r\nProf. Bornhak's _Geschichte der Franzosischen Literatur_, and the\r\nmore popular history by Engel (4th ed., 1897). Lotheissen's\r\n_Geschichte der Franzosischen Literatur im XVII. Jahrhundert_ seems\r\nto me the best book on the period. The monographs in German are\r\nnumberless.\r\n\r\nThe editions of authors in the _Grands Ecrivains de la France_ are\r\nof the highest authority. The best anthology of French poetry is\r\nCrepet's _Les Poetes francais_ (4 vols.). Small anthologies of French\r\npoetry since the fifteenth century, and of French lyrical poets of\r\nthe nineteenth century, are published by Lemerre.\r\n\r\nThe list which follows is taken partly from books which I have used\r\nin writing this volume, partly from the Bibliography in M. Lintilhac's\r\n_Histoire de la Litterature francaise_. To name English writers and\r\nbooks seems unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MIDDLE AGES\r\n\r\n_Histoire litteraire de la France_ (a vast repertory on mediaeval\r\nliterature).\r\n\r\nGASTON PARIS. _La Litterature francaise au moyen Age_. 1890.\r\n\r\nAUBERTIN. _Hist. de la Langue et de la Litt. francaises au moyen Age_.\r\n2 vols. 1883.\r\n\r\nG.
