'96).--The Governor General to the Colonial\r\nMinister:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Vast organization of secret societies discovered with anti-national\r\n    tendencies.\r\n\r\n    Twenty-two persons detained, among them the Gran Oriente\r\n    (of Philippine freemasonry) of the Philippines, and others of\r\n    importance.....................................................\r\n    ...............................................................\r\n    Immediate action taken and special judge will be designated for\r\n    greater activity in the proceedings............................\r\n    ...............................................................\r\n\r\n        --Blanco.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was the telegram sent by Gen. Blanco and read by Sr. Castellano\r\nin the Spanish Camara, announcing the discovery of the revolutionary\r\nmovement headed by the Katipunan, the bastard child of Filipino\r\nfreemasonry.\r\n\r\nFreemasonry in the Philippines was but a pretext: under this pretext\r\nthe enemies of Spain, in days of Spanish rule, and the enemies of\r\nthe U. S. in these days of American rule, put themselves into close\r\nand secret communion, to earn out plans of revolt.\r\n\r\nThis Filipino masonry cast its net far and wide, and in its meshes were\r\ncaught many fish of all classes and conditions; some of them men of\r\nmoney who sought in masonry what money could easily purchase,--honors\r\nand titles, grand crosses and medals; others were men whose pockets\r\nwere more or less replete, and whose aims were of a great variety of\r\nnatures; whilst others were men whose treasuries were more or less\r\nempty and who sought in masonry what they did not care to earn by\r\nhonest labor--a livelihood.\r\n\r\nMasonry was imported into the Archipelago, shortly after the Spanish\r\nRevolution, and was, during the first years of its life, confined\r\nto Spaniards; but later on it opened its doors to half-castes and\r\nindians. In 1887 it extended by leaps and bounds; but upon the\r\ncoming of Gen. Weyler to the Archipelago, as Governor General, in\r\n1888, it dwindled away almost into nothingness. Gen. Weyler was,\r\nand has ever shown himself, a patriotic Spaniard; and he would not\r\npermit the existence here, under his Governorship, of anything which\r\ntended to the detriment of his country. Well did the masons of the\r\nPhilippines and elsewhere know this, and hence the vicious and cruel\r\ncampaign they carried on against him both in the Peninsular and Cuba,\r\nbut more especially in the U. S. of America.\r\n\r\nThe Katipunan, the bastard child of filipino masonry, that ungrateful\r\noffspring which was unfaithful even to the mother which brought it\r\nforth, was a society within the bosom of which was redeveloped the\r\nmalay instinct which had lain dormant for some three centuries. This\r\ninstinct, brutal, savage, intensely ignorant, immoral, ungodly;\r\nan instinct found still among some of the uncivilized tribes of the\r\nmountain fastnesses of Luzon; an instinct once almost blotted out after\r\nmany years of most difficult labor and self-sacrifice on the part of\r\nthe Religious Orders, once again burst forth in all its strength.\r\n\r\nThe indian left to himself, deprived of the curbing influence of the\r\nchristian religion, speedily falls back into the condition of depravity\r\nin which Urdaneta and Legazpi found him. The malay instinct, like the\r\nvolcano, vomits forth when least expected; the history of the revolt of\r\nthe Tagalogs gives overabundant proof of it. Take one by one the many\r\nleading characters in the revolution, and the instinct will be found\r\nso plainly marked, that it is unmistakable. Take for instance Marcelo\r\nH. del Pilar, in whose brain was conceived the plot of the Katipunan\r\nfarsical-tragedy; Andres Bonifacio, whose duty was the materializing\r\nof the plot; the Lunas, Juan especially, who had some time previous,\r\nin Paris, given an example of how easily the malay burned through the\r\nveneer of civilization to which the Filipino indian is susceptible;\r\nand so on, including the Aguinaldos, the Mabinis, the Agoncillos\r\nand even many of those, who in these days boast in public of their\r\namericanist ideas, and in private plot with treacherous zeal to\r\noverthrow the government of those they call their deliverers from\r\nSpanish tyranny. In them all may be traced the strange instinct\r\nof the old time filipino indian. Entering the fold of freemasonry,\r\nthey threw off the bridle of religion which restrained them; loosing\r\nrespect for Almighty God and for their faith they soon lost respect\r\nfor others and for themselves. The result is well known. History,\r\nthe history of the last five or six years, has shown it to us.\r\n\r\nIt is of this society of notables--for such is the meaning of the full\r\ntitle of the Katipunan--that I wish to say a few words in the following\r\npages. I have taken as a foundation for my study, a very concise\r\nstatement of the whole situation, drawn up by Capt. Olegario Diaz,\r\nCommander of the Guardia Civil Veterana de Manila. This document being\r\nan official statement, is of vital interest in the study of the birth,\r\nlife and internal corruption of that diabolical association which,\r\ngigantic though it was, comparatively speaking, could, by reason of\r\nits infantility, have been easily stifled, had it been dealt with,\r\nwith a strong hand. I have taken the document as a base, and by a\r\nseries of notes in the form of a somewhat more lengthy appendix,\r\nhave endeavored to provide my readers with a file of interesting\r\nitems of historical value.\r\n\r\nThis pamphlet is not intended to be a history of the rebellion; I have\r\nendeavored to confine myself to the society which brought about the\r\nrevolt, and if at any time I have strayed from the path I laid out\r\nfor myself, it has been because there was by the wayside some flower\r\nI wished to pluck to add to the bouquet I herewith present to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATEMENT OF CAPT. OLEGARIO DIAZ [1]\r\n\r\n\r\nFREEMASONRY\r\n\r\nIt is fully proved that freemasonry has been the principal factor\r\nfor the development in these islands, not only of advanced (2)\r\nand anti-religious ideas, but chiefly for the foundation of secret\r\nsocieties, possessing a character especially separatist (3). This\r\nconviction I have come to after the examination of a countless number\r\nof documents, and the much correspondence this Corps (4) fell in with,\r\nafter laborious work and investigations, in the possession of several\r\nwell known filibusters (5) who are at the present time prisoners;\r\nthese documents and parcels of correspondence were included in the\r\nmilitary suit tried before Colonel D. Francisco Olive (6).\r\n\r\n\"Some 20 years ago, there was installed in this country, a lodge\r\ndependent upon the Gr. Or. Espanol (7): a lodge which was inoffensive\r\nin its beginning because it was composed of peninsular Spaniards, with\r\nthe absolute exclusion of the native element of the Archipelago. In\r\nthis form it developed languidly until the year 1890.\r\n\r\n\"During this epoch, the Filipino colony resident in Madrid, Hong-Kong\r\nand Paris, in the which figured as exalted separatists Jose Rizal (8),\r\nMarcelo H. del Pilar (9), Graciano Lopez, Mariano Ponce, Eduardo Lete,\r\nAntonio and Juan Luna (10), Julio Llorente, Salvador V. del Rosario,\r\nDoroteo Cortes (11), Jose Baza, Pedro Serrano (12), Moises Salvador,\r\nGalicano Apacible and many others, who were in communication with\r\nthe seditious elements of Manila, strove hard to influence don Miguel\r\nMorayta (13), (Grand master of the Oriente Espanol), in Madrid, and\r\nwith whom they sustained close relations, to the end that the statutes\r\nshould be reformed so that the native element might be affiliated,\r\nand even more, that lodges of a character exclusively Tagalog (14),\r\nmight be created in the Archipelago. Conferences, general gatherings,\r\nand finally compromises of certain magnitude decided in the favor\r\nof the Filipinos, Morayta thus, unconsciously sowing the seed, the\r\nfruit of which we are to-day gathering.\r\n\r\n\"D. Alejandro Roji, resident in this capital, Captain of Engineers, was\r\nnominated general delegate to direct the works, and with ample powers\r\nfrom Morayta, came the native school-teacher Pedro Serrano, who enjoyed\r\nin Manila the confidence and protection of the said Colonel, assisted\r\nby the Flores, lieutenants of Infantry, Numeriano Adriano, Ambrosio\r\nRianzares, Juan Zulueta, Faustino Villaruel (15), Agustin de la Rosa,\r\nAmbrosio Salvador, Andres Bonifacio (16), Apolinario Mabini (17),\r\nEstanislao Legaspi Domingo Franco (18), Roman Basa, Deodato Arellano,\r\nAntonio Salazar, Felipe Zamora, Nazario Constantino, Bonifacio Arevalo,\r\nPedro Casimiro, Dionisio Ferraz, Timoteo Paez and a thousand others,\r\nall indians, but having a career or a comfortable social position;\r\nthey commenced a silent and tenacious propaganda which resulted in\r\n180 Tagalog lodges, extended throughout the territory of Luzon and\r\npart of the Bisayas, being constituted in 5 years. The character of\r\nthe native (19), so propitious to all the mysterious and symbolic,\r\neasily accustomed itself to the ridiculous practices of freemasonry:\r\nthe initiations (20), the proofs (21), the oaths (22), attributes,\r\nsigns and pass words, and the pseudonyms, all and everything surrounded\r\nby shade and mystery, appealed to the native and served him as an\r\neducative ladder which prepared his mind for his entry into other\r\nassociations of graver transcendencies, according as the initiators\r\nand apostles of filibusterism, Rizal, Pilar, Lopez, Cortes and Zulueta\r\nhad forseen, as can be proved by that correspondence which has come\r\nto my hands.\r\n\r\n\"In order to direct the organization of the lodges dependant upon the\r\nGran Oriente Espanol, there was constituted by Morayta, a Gran Consejo\r\nRegional (23) which received its instructions from him, and which was\r\npresided over by Ambrosio Flores (h. Muza), and formed of Adriano,\r\nVillaruel, Flores (A), Mabini, Paez, Zamora, Mariano and Salazar. The\r\nnewspaper La Solidaridad (24) which, in the previous year had been\r\nfounded in Barcelona by M. Pilar, as a delegate of the propaganda of\r\nManila, and the publishing centre of which was later on translated to\r\nMadrid, was declared the official organ of all Filipino masonry; and\r\nin its collaboration, all the Filipinos of a medium culture resident\r\nin the capital, took a hand, under the auspices and direction of its\r\nnew proprietor, the oft-mentioned and ill-starred Morayta.\r\n\r\n\"In 1893 the Gran Oriente Nacional, of which the Grand Master\r\nis Sr. Pantoja, reporter of the highest tribunal of justice,\r\nconceded powers to the lieutenant military councillor Sr. Lacasa,\r\nand the sergeant of Infantry, Jose Martin, to carry on propaganda\r\nin these islands among the native element, and in competition with\r\nthe other Oriente. The result did not correspond to the efforts of\r\nthe propagandists, who only succeeded in creating some few lodges\r\nin the Capital, in Cavite, Cagayan, Iloilo and Negros. How could it\r\nbe expected to prosper, when the Gran Oriente Espanol had already\r\ncatechized the masses of the country!\r\n\r\n\"It must be declared, although it makes one blush to do so, that many\r\npeninsular Spaniards, and among them some holding important official\r\npositions in the country, have contributed to this propaganda,\r\nscandalous, and from all points of view, aimed at the integrity of\r\nthe nation (25). Only candor can exculpate them. May the country\r\npardon them.\r\n\r\n\"From the first moments, both in the organ of Filipino freemasonry,\r\nLa Solidaridad, and in the circulars which the Gran Oriente sent to\r\nSpain for the information of the brethren there resident, was commenced\r\na coarse and shameless campaign against the Monastic Orders (26), and\r\nof scoffing and ridicule of religion. Later on, this campaign acquired\r\na political character, attacking the government of the metropolis,\r\nand the authorities of the archipelago, demanding liberal reforms\r\nfor the country, such as representation in the Cortes, the colonial\r\nCamara, municipal autonomy, increase of individual rights etc. etc.,\r\nLet anyone with half an eye examine carefully the collections of the\r\ncited paper, and he will certainly meet with something contrary to\r\nthe national unity, artfully and modestly hidden. Let him read the\r\nalmost countless number of documents (27) pertaining to the Tagalog\r\nlodges, and sent by me to the judge, Senor Olive, which were united\r\nto the charges, and the most incredulous will be convinced that the\r\nlodges and their aids and abettors devoted themselves to something\r\nmore than the propaganda of freemasonry. There is not a single one\r\nof the chiefs and organizers of the filibuster organizations up to\r\nthis time discovered, who is not a freemason.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"LA PROPAGANDA\" AND THE \"ASOCIACION HISPANO-FILIPINA.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of the year 1888, Marcelo del Pilar, a lawyer of Bulacan,\r\nand a frenetic filibuster, considering himself in peril of deportation\r\nin consequence of juridical proceedings formed against him in\r\nthe said province, decided to translate his residence to Spain,\r\nunder the shelter of a certain element of the country (28). In those\r\ndays was created in Manila a committee of propaganda (29) formed by\r\nDoroteo Cortes, Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista, Pedro Serrano and Deodato\r\nArellano, under the presidency of the first named, its mission being\r\nthe gathering from among the better class and more wealthy element,\r\nfunds for the propagation throughout the Archipelago, of all classes\r\nof pamphlets and proclamations written to depreciate and cast slurs\r\nupon the Monastic Orders (30), and upon Religion; and likewise\r\nfor the implantation in the country democratic doctrines; finally\r\nthe nomination was agreed to of a delegation which should depend\r\ndirectly upon the committee recently constituted, and which should\r\nhave its residence in Barcelona, its duty being to make overtures\r\nto the public authorities for the concession to the Archipelago of\r\ngreater liberties and of representation in the Cortes in the first\r\nplace. And in order to sustain and defend these ideals together with\r\nsome few more, the foundation was authorized of a bi-monthly newspaper.\r\n\r\n\"The committee of propaganda fully fulfilled its mission; it overcame\r\nall the wealthy element of Luzon (31), gathered grand quantities,\r\nand Marcelo del Pilar set off for the Peninsular, installing himself\r\ncomfortably in the \"Ciudad Condal\"  [2] at the expense of his\r\ncountrymen (32).\r\n\r\n\"In January 1889, he commenced the campaign in union with his companion\r\nof the delegation Mariano Ponce. They founded the paper La Solidaridad\r\nand constituted the Hispano-Filipino association, into which were\r\ndrawn a large number of the native students residing in Barcelona\r\n[3]. The committee made great progress in Manila, added to the number\r\nof its followers and collected funds in return for subscriptions to\r\nLa Solidaridad which, day by day, had more readers; it distributed\r\nbooks, pamphlets and proclamations of the worst class, for which a\r\ngood price was collected.\r\n\r\n\"The association had increased hand over hand; its aspirations (33)\r\nwere most radical; and considering its action limited in Barcelona,\r\nit determined to translate its headquarters to Madrid, where it\r\nwould have a wider field for its pretensions. About this same time\r\nSerrano, Rizal, Luna, Lopez etc., were united to the delegation and\r\nthey succeeded in implanting Tagalog masonry in their country (34),\r\nand from this precise moment, commenced their relations with Morayta.\r\n\r\n\"In January 1890 the \"Asociacion Hispano-Filipina,\" [4] the delegation,\r\nand the paper La Solidaridad were installed in Madrid. Morayta\r\naccepted the presidency of the Association and became proprietor of\r\nthe newspaper from which such good results were expected, it counting\r\nwith an increased output to supply enforced subscriptions among masons\r\nand their associates at the rate of a peso a head.\r\n\r\n\"From that moment Morayta was made the idol of the turbulent indians,\r\nwho considered him as their redeemer; no one is ignorant of the\r\nlabors undertaken by the said personage in Spain, both in the realms\r\nof journalism and around and about the powers that be, on behalf of\r\nthe securing representation in the Cortes, the liberty of association\r\n(35) and that of the press, municipal autonomy and even under a hidden\r\nguise, of that of the colony; in the memory of all is preserved\r\nthe remembrance of the banquet given by the Filipinos inspired by\r\nMorayta, to Sr. Labra, the autonomist deputy for Cuba, and no one has\r\nforgotten the proposition presented to the Congress by Sr. Junoy, the\r\nrepublican deputy, also inspired by the Association and the delegation\r\npresided over and protected by Morayta. And who finally, does not\r\nfeel indignation upon calling to mind the articles published in La\r\nSolidaridad by the Filipinos Kalipulako (M. Ponce), Jaena (G. Lopez),\r\nDimas-Alang (Jose Rizal), Eduardo Lete, Taga-Ilog (Antonio Luna),\r\nJuan Totoo (J. Zulueta) and Kupang or Maitalaga (M. del Pilar)?\r\n\r\n\"What Spaniard is not fired to anger, upon reading the books and\r\npamphlets written by Rizal, Luna and Lopez and the infinite number of\r\nprinted libels which circulate here full of falsities and loathsome\r\ncalumnies against the most sacred and venerated, the Fatherland? Have\r\nwe forgotten, perhaps, Dr. Blumentritt (36) who repaid our most\r\ngenerous hospitality by making common cause with our enemies? Do\r\nwe not call to mind, peradventure, that all the filipino colony in\r\nSpain and a good portion of that here resident, sympathised with that\r\nungrateful man, conferring upon him the honor of banqueting him and\r\nextending to him their congratulations?\r\n\r\n\"Fortunately these labors obtained no practical result in the peninsula\r\n(37), but they caused the native element of some amount of culture\r\nto harbor imaginary ills and want of confidence in the Metropolis,\r\ncovert discontent with the authorities of the islands (38), and\r\nfinally, sowed the seed of aspirations which could never be realized\r\n[5]. but a seed which is to-day, unfortunately, bearing fruit.\r\n\r\n\"A casino of recreation known as the Centro Filipino, was also\r\norganized in Madrid: a revolutionary club was the only thing to\r\nwhich that center could be compared. There Spain was discussed,\r\ncriticized and slandered under the shelter of the law of association\r\nwhich prevails in the Peninsula, and shielded by the hypocrisy and\r\ndeception so proper of cowards.\r\n\r\n\"Personal rivalries and the want of morality in the administration of\r\nthe funds (39) remitted from Manila by the committee of propaganda,\r\ngave rise to a grave disagreement between the two apostles of filipino\r\nfilibusterism, Rizal and Pilar; with the former sided the young\r\nand impetuous element; with the latter the mature and thoughtful\r\n(40). Both elaborated the same material, but each using a different\r\nprocess; the one boldly insolent and hostile, the other masked with\r\nhypocrisy and calm. Both being ambitious, each found the world too\r\nsmall to contain him. This state of things ceased with the coming\r\nof Rizal to these islands in 1892 (41), Pilar remaining the absolute\r\npossessor of the field at Madrid.\r\n\r\n\"In the meanwhile the committee of propaganda was not inactive. It\r\ncreated delegations throughout the archipelago, and by their means\r\nintroduced the La Solidaridad and all kinds of revolutionary printed\r\nmatter into the utmost corners of the archipelago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \"LIGA FILIPINA\"\r\n\r\n\"Rizal, magnanimously pardoned by His Excellency the Captain General\r\nof the Archipelago, D. Eulogio Despujol (42), after the making of a\r\nthousand and one lying protests of repentance, reached this capital in\r\nMay 1892, being received by his countrymen with extraordinary proofs\r\nof enthusiasm and rejoicing; and converting himself into an apostle\r\nof filibusterism, commenced a campaign of scandalous propaganda.\r\n\r\n\"Three days after his arrival he convoked a large reunion (43) in\r\nthe house of the Chinese half-caste Ongjungco in Tondo, and under his\r\npresidentship there gathered Franco, property owner; Flores, Lieutenant\r\nof Infantry; Rianzares, lawyer; Zulueta, government employee; Adriano,\r\nnotary; Reyes, tailor; Paez, business agent; Francisco, industrial;\r\nSerrano, school-teacher; A. Salvador, contractor; Salazar, industrial;\r\nMariano, property owner; Legaspi, industrial; Jose, property owner;\r\nBonifacio, warehouse porter; Plata, curial; Villareal, tailor; Rosa,\r\nbook-keeper; Arellano, military employee; M. Salvador, industrial;\r\nArevalo, dentist; Rosario, merchant; Santillan, industrial; Ramos,\r\nindustrial; Joven, property owner; Villaruel, merchant; Mabini,\r\nlawyer; Nacpil, silversmith; and many other Filipinos well known by\r\ntheir ideas. To this assembly Rizal made known the motive which had\r\ninspired him to call it together, which was no other than the creation\r\nof a secret society to be known as the \"Liga Filipina\", founded for\r\nthe purpose of fomenting the advancement and culture of the country and\r\nthe attaining, later on, of emancipation from Spain (44). He read out a\r\nlist of provisional regulations drawn up by himself; these regulations\r\nwere unanimously approved; a commission formed of Ambrosio Salvador\r\nand Deodato Arellano as president and secretary respectively, was at\r\nonce nominated for the studying and development of Rizal's project,\r\nand the reunion was dissolved till it should be again convoked.\r\n\r\n\"The opportune deportation of Rizal (45), Cortes and Salvador,\r\nupset the plans of the \"oath bound\" conspirators and the panic thus\r\nbrought about dispersed them for the moment. In the beginning of the\r\nyear 1893 they re-assumed the work (46), sometimes in the house of\r\nDomingo Franco, and at others in that of Deodato Arellano; and after\r\nit had been agreed that they should be ruled by the regulations of\r\nRizal, and votes having been cast, the Supreme Council of the \"Liga\"\r\nwas constituted in the following form:\r\n\r\n\r\n            President                   Franco.\r\n            Secretary & Treasurer       Arellano.\r\n            Fiscal                      Francisco.\r\n                                     /  Zulueta.\r\n                                     |  Legaspi.\r\n                                     |  Paez.\r\n                                     |  Bonifacio.\r\n            Councillors              +  Nacpil.\r\n                                     |  Adriano.\r\n                                     |  Mabini.\r\n                                     |  Rianzares.\r\n                                     \\  Flores.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Before continuing, and in order that the facts which follow\r\nmay be better understood, I will give some idea of the \"Liga\"\r\naccording to the mentioned regulations. Its determined ends (47),\r\nwere the independence of the islands; its means, the propaganda of\r\nadvanced political ideas (48), availing themselves of conferences,\r\nbooks, pamphlets and the paper \"La Solidaridad\" which was declared\r\nthe official organ of the association; the culture of the country\r\nby means of study, and its material advancement by stimulating the\r\ncreation of large enterprises and industries; and, as a final means,\r\narmed rebellion (49). The catechised or initiated submitted themselves\r\nto a solemn oath before a human skull, which they afterwards kissed,\r\nsigning with their own blood (50) a compromising document, after\r\nmaking the corresponding incision in one of their arms.\r\n\r\n\"All those initiated incurred the duty of making propaganda (51) by all\r\nmeans in their power, and of increasing the number of the associates,\r\nof preserving under severest penalties, the most impenetrable silence\r\non all matters relating to the \"Liga\" and blind obedience to their\r\nsuperiors. The association was governed by a Supreme Council with\r\nresidence in Manila, and composed of a President, a Treasurer, a\r\nFiscal, a Secretary and twelve Councillors; for the Peninsular and\r\nHong-Kong, the delegations composed of Marcelo del Pilar and Ildefonso\r\nLaurel [6].\r\n\r\n\"In each province was formed a provincial council with the same\r\norganizations as the Supreme Council, but with only six councillors,\r\nwho, in their turn, had under their orders as many popular councils as\r\nthere should be pueblos in the province in which the council should\r\nbe constituted. The popular councils with analogous organization to\r\nthe provincial councils, had jurisdiction within the demarcation of a\r\npueblo; they depended directly upon the respective provincial council\r\nand the provincial upon the Supreme.\r\n\r\n\"All the members of the Supreme Council were to constitute in the\r\ncapital of Manila a popular council formed of their converts within\r\nthe zone of their residences; and all the members had to recruit among\r\nthe natives of some culture, till the society should be thoroughly\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\n\"Each treasurer collected a peso as entrance fee from the initiated and\r\na medio (half) peso, as a monthly subscription for each member. With\r\nthe said funds there was created a central deposit in the treasury\r\nof the Supreme Council, for the covering of the expenses of the\r\ndelegations, and the sustainment of the Solidaridad; and it was agreed\r\nthat once there should be sufficient capital, great enterprises,\r\nof a nature undetermined, should be undertaken.\r\n\r\n\"The eternal question of money in this class of organizations\r\n(52) gave rise to a serious falling out between Rizal and the Liga\r\n(53), on which account their official relations were severed. The\r\nsubscriptions were badly collected, and those encharged with the\r\ncustody and turning in of what few funds did exist misapplied them\r\n(54); this was what brought about the decadence of the league and\r\nthe cause of its falling into discredit and disrepute and for its\r\nnot prospering, in spite of the fact that among those who aided\r\nit with their moral and metalic aid, but without formal or written\r\ncompromise (55), were a number of shameless filibusters, so much the\r\nmore repugnant as the brilliant social position they held under the\r\nprotection of Spain was elevated. Among many others may be cited the\r\nwealthy proprietors Pedro and Francisco Roxas (56), Mariano Linjap,\r\nTelesforo Chuidian, Luis R. Yangco, Antonio and Juan Luna, Felipe\r\nZamora, Eduardo Litonjua, Marcelino de los Santos, Maximo Paterno\r\n(57) and Nazario Constantino (58).\r\n\r\n\"Of the members of the Supreme Council, only the following succeeded\r\nin forming popular councils: Estanislao Legaspi who organized one\r\nin Tondo, known as Talang Bakero; Andres Bonifacio, one in Trozo,\r\nknown as Mayon; and Francisco Nacpil, one in Santa Cruz, known as\r\nMactan (59). The rest of the members of the Supreme Council only\r\nsucceeded in forming the following fruitless sections: Flores, one\r\nin Ermita and Malate; Zulueta in Binondo; Rianzares in San Nicolas;\r\nFrancisco in Quiapo; Adriano and Mabini in Sampaloc and Nagtajan,\r\nand Salvador in Pandacan.\r\n\r\n\"In the provinces also the Liga enjoyed such slow progress, that it was\r\nnot possible to organize to popular councils, but sections only, and\r\nthese were organized in the Laguna, by Vicente Reyes; in Batangas by\r\nFelipe Agoncillo (60); in Nueva Ecija, Bentus and Natividad; in Tarlac\r\nthe notary del Rosario, and in Bulacan, Pampanga and other provinces\r\nwealthy persons of the same. In time, there was not a Filipino of\r\nwealth or career or of medium social position, who did not pertain to,\r\nor aid and abet the Liga, apart from a few most honorable exceptions\r\n(61) which it pleases me to recognize.\r\n\r\n\"At the commencement of the year 1894 and when the league had reached\r\nthe age of one year, the members agreed to the dissolution of the\r\nsociety, both on account of the discords which continually sprung up in\r\nits bosom, and for the fear of discovery by the authorities which had\r\nalready perceived something of the goings on (62). A grand assembly\r\nof the leaders was called together and it was determined to gather\r\nin as many documents as had been drawn up or circulated, and make a\r\nbonfire of them, so that all compromising indications should be made\r\nto disappear. The society became dissolved but it took a form more\r\nhypocritical. The popular councils re-entered the masonic lodges, and\r\nthese took up the work of the Liga, a thing very easy to accomplish,\r\nwhen we remember that there was not a single member of the society\r\nwho was not a freemason.\r\n\r\n\"There remained however, as a living remembrance of the Liga, a\r\ncommittee formed of the lawyer Numeriano Adriano and Deodato Arellano\r\n(a brother-in-law of Pilar) president and secretary, who had at their\r\norders some 20 or 30 members from among the most important of the\r\ndefunct Liga and who were known under the name of the compromisarios\r\n(63). These enjoyed no special organization and worked with almost\r\nentire independence. Their mission was the propagation of the La\r\nSolidaridad and the gathering of funds for the sustainment of the\r\npaper, and of the delegations in the Peninsula and elsewhere, with\r\nwhich they sustained active political correspondence. The work was\r\ncontinued with greater cunning by the lodges and by the compromisarios;\r\nand they succeeded in keeping alive the spirit of protest in a good\r\npart (the most influential) of the native element till the end of\r\nthe year 1895.\r\n\r\n\"About this time the populous empire of China was defeated by the\r\nJapanese, and the Japanese Empire, having won the laurels of victory so\r\neasily, began to consider the weaving of a net of preponderance in the\r\nOccident. The Filipinos who followed with interest and satisfaction\r\nour contrarieties in Cuba, considered the occasion propitious for\r\nthe Empire of the Rising Sun to copy in these islands the conduct\r\nof the Americans in the Antilles. Japan became the fashion in the\r\nArchipelago and its inhabitants were chosen as models of culture (64),\r\nwealth, of liberty and strength. They sighed for their protection and\r\nassistance, and to the attaining of it they uselessly directed their\r\nefforts. Doroteo Cortes emigrated to Yokohama (65), and with him Ramos,\r\nBaza, Espanol and others, where they established a separatist committee\r\nin correspondence with that of Manila. Marcelo del Pilar prepared to\r\nleave Madrid to join them, but died suddenly in Barcelona and finally\r\nthe foolish political schemers dreamed of the liberation of Rizal\r\n(66) who had been deported to Dapitan, in order that he also should\r\nfollow Cortes and the others. From Manila there departed frequently\r\nparties of wealthy Filipinos who went to Japan under the pretext of\r\nmaking recreative, instructive or artistic voyages, but in reality\r\nto conspire, and it is assured that they were listened to by some of\r\nthe official element of that nation (67). The Japanese corvette Kongo\r\n(68) arrived in Manila in the month of May and no one could explain\r\nits sudden appearance in the bay; but on the other hand the officers\r\nwere mysteriously banqueted by a commission of Filipinos in the Bazar\r\nJapones (69) where they lodged. Causalities perhaps, but....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        K. K. K. N. M. A. N. B.\r\n\r\n     KATAASTAASANG KALAGAYAN KATIPUNAN NANG MANGA ANAK NANG BAYAN.\r\n\r\n             Supreme Society of the Sons of the People [7].\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst Rizal, in Manila, was engaged in the organization of the\r\n\"Liga Filipina\" into which only the well-to-do or educated classes\r\ncould enter (70), an attempt which, for that time, failed on account\r\nof his immediate deportation, Marcelo H. del Pilar, from Madrid,\r\nin July 1892, advised the creation of another association, which\r\nwas to be similar thereto, but which was to include the agricultural\r\nlaborers and persons of little or no education and instruction (71),\r\nbut who directed in the localities by the caciques and chiefs, were\r\nto form an enormous nucleus which should, at the proper time, give\r\nforth the cry of rebellion. He (Pilar) provided minute instructions\r\nconcerning the organization and forwarded a project of regulations.\r\n\r\n\"Deodato Arellano (brother in-law of Marcelo), Andres Bonifacio,\r\nLadislao Dina and Teodoro Plata where those commissioned to carry into\r\npractice the project of Pilar (72); they discussed the regulations and\r\nadded to them making them still more terrifying, agreeing that they\r\nshould all immediately proceed with the preparatory works, and they\r\nwere not interrupted till the conspiracy was discovered on the 19th of\r\nAugust of this year (1896). Both the said organizers and the others who\r\ncomposed the first Supreme Council, belonged to the \"Liga filipina\".\r\n\r\n\"The organization given to the society was analogous to that enjoyed by\r\nthe \"Liga\" (73) but amplified to the extent of anarchism, swearing\r\nhatred and destruction to everything of a character or nature Spanish\r\n(74), and sowing the seed of a race-hatred which has developed to\r\na great extent (75). The Supreme, the Provincial and the popular\r\nCouncils, the sections and the delegations ruled this horrible\r\nassociation. The first governed the whole Tagalog Katipunan (76);\r\nthe second, that corresponding to a pueblo and the sections were\r\nsub-divisions or fractions into which the popular councils were\r\ndivided. Those commissioned to form sections were called delegations,\r\nand whilst they remained unconstituted, they depended directly upon\r\nthe Supreme Council. Every associate paid an entrance fee of a medio\r\npeso, and a monthly subscription of a real. The collections were made\r\nby the respective treasurers and passed into the central treasury\r\nof the Supreme Council. The funds so gathered were utilized for the\r\nsuccor of the brethren in their afflictions and sicknesses, for the\r\ncovering the expenses of the works of propaganda, and for the secret\r\nacquisition of fire and other arms (77).\r\n\r\n\"As in freemasonry, the initiations (78) were performed with a wealth\r\nof the ridiculous, and with unending extravagances; but of such a\r\nnature, that the ignorant indian was fascinated and became converted\r\ninto a slave of his oath.\r\n\r\n\"The initiated were masked (79) as also was the person to be initiated;\r\nbefore a table was placed a skull and crossbones, a triangle and two\r\ncandles; the person about to be initiated was told that the object of\r\nthe Katipunan [8] was the liberating of the Tagalog people, and the\r\nexpulsion of the Spaniards from the archipelago, or their destruction\r\n(80); following this, came a series of questions and replies in the\r\nwhich the martyrdom of Gomez, Burgos and Zamora (81), native priests\r\njudged and condemned for their part in the rebellion of Cavite in 1872\r\nwas exalted, and they passed on to the proofs (82) which consisted in\r\nimitating an assassination, a suicide, etc. This was followed by the\r\ntaking of an oath of striving to effect the liberation of the people\r\ntill death, an oath which demanded a blind obedience to the commands\r\nof the superior and the preservation of the secrets of the association\r\nunder the pain of death (83). Finally, to terminate the ceremony,\r\nthey made with a dagger especially adapted to that use, an incision\r\nin the arm of the person initiated and with the blood which flowed\r\nfrom the wound thus made, the new katipunero signed his compromise\r\n(see note 50.)\r\n\r\n\"The initiated were called brethren and had their \"sacred words\"\r\nand their special signs of recognition. They were ruled by a code\r\nwhich established punishments ranging from whipping till death (84)\r\nand received no orders from anyone, or had no intercourse with anyone,\r\nexcept with their immediate superiors. The details which might be\r\nmade mention of are infinite and curious, but it would make this\r\nshort memorial unending to speak of them all.\r\n\r\n\"All the matters of importance and organization were dealt with\r\nin assemblies (85) constituted by the Supreme Councils and all the\r\npresidents of the provincial and popular councils. The accords were\r\ntaken and discussions decided by a nominal votation and at least by\r\na majority of votes.\r\n\r\n\"Both the Supreme, the provincial and the popular Councils and the\r\nsections held their periodical sessions in the which were discussed a\r\nthousand different affairs, and the decisions of the Councils had to\r\nbe submitted to the approval of the immediate superior. The gatherings\r\nwere always held in different houses and localities, no day being set\r\naside as fixed, but the days of festivities or those upon which was\r\nobserved some ecclesiastical feast were chosen for that purpose (86),\r\nunder the pretext of banquets or dances in which the authorities had no\r\nsuspicion, and because on the said days these semi-public rejoicings\r\nwere permitted without the necessity of seeking the license of the\r\ngoverning authorities.\r\n\r\n\"Both the provincial and the popular councils and the sections were\r\nknown by special names; the initiated were \"baptized\" with symbolic\r\nappellations; and the documents were drawn up in the Tagalog dialect,\r\nthe most important being in secret code.\r\n\r\n\"The first Supreme Council was constituted on the 15th of July 1892,\r\nand was as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n            President           Deodato Arellano.\r\n            Secretary           Andres Bonifacio.\r\n            Treasurer           Valentin Diaz.\r\n                              / Ladislao Dina.\r\n            Councillors       + Bricio Pantas.\r\n                              \\ Teodoro Plata.\r\n\r\n\r\nDelegates were immediately appointed to establish sections in Tondo,\r\nBinondo, Trozo, Sta. Cruz, Nagtajan, Sampaloc, Quiapo, Dilao (Paco)\r\nand Intramuros. Commissioners set out with all rapidity to the\r\nneighboring pueblos and provinces, and in a few weeks councils\r\nwere in working order in Caloocan, Malabon, Mandaloyan, San Juan\r\ndel Monte, Pandacan, Sta. Ana, and Pasay. In the Capital of Cavite\r\nwas constituted a popular council, and sections in Noveleta, Cavite\r\nViejo and Imus. The same occurred in San Isidro, Gapan and several\r\nother pueblos of these provinces.\r\n\r\n'Andres Bonifacio, Secretary of the Supreme Council, displayed a\r\nnotable audacity and energy, and this united to a clear intelligence,\r\ngave him a great predominance over his companions. This predominance\r\nhe asserted, and in 1893 brought about the destitution from the\r\npresidency, of Deodato Arellano, Roman Baza (87), chief clerk of\r\nthe Comandancia General de Marina being elevated to that office. On\r\naccount of the want of character and initiative on the part of the new\r\npresident, Bonifacio decided, by a coup-d'etat if we may so call it,\r\nto depose him also, putting himself in that office and becoming the\r\n\"dictator\" of the Katipunan.\r\n\r\n\"Under the Presidency of Bonifacio, the society commenced an era of\r\nfebrile activity; the greater number of the tribunales of the pueblos\r\nwere converted into centres of propaganda, which were directed by the\r\nmunicipalities. Pamphlets and proclamations against the friars and\r\nthe whole Spanish element were circulated in profusion (88). Injuries\r\nand outrages were invented, and by these and a thousand and one other\r\ninfamous means, little by little, hatred and revenge were inculcated\r\ninto the mind of the indian.\r\n\r\n\"In 1895 Bonifacio took the first decisive steps towards the\r\norganizing of an armed rebellion; he sent different delegations to\r\nDapitan to confer with Rizal and receive his advice and instruction\r\n(89); he opened negotiations with the Japanese Government (90),\r\nbut did not succeed therein. But with his immense ascendancy over\r\nthe popular masses, an ascendancy beyond imagination, he declared\r\nhimself dictator. The secret aiders of the Katipunan who pertained\r\nto the upper classes, offered funds of considerable amount, with the\r\nwhich were acquired a good number of arms which were landed on the\r\ncoast of Cavite and Batangas with the aid of wealthy persons (91).\r\n\r\n\"In August of this year (1896) exaltation among the masses reached\r\nits full height, and Bonifacio realizing the fact, prepared what\r\nwas necessary in order that in a short time, the conspiracy which\r\nwas to take effect on the same day and hour in almost all Luzon,\r\nshould be in readiness. The plan of the attack and taking of Manila\r\nwas coarsely conceived but it might have been successful and massacre,\r\nsacking and pillage would have crowned the iniquitous work.\r\n\r\n\"At this time the Supreme Council was was composed as follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n            President           Andres Bonifacio.\r\n            Secretary           Emilio Jacinto.\r\n            Treasurer           Enrique Pacheco.\r\n            Fiscal              Pio Valenzuela (92).\r\n                             /  Hermenegildo Reyes.\r\n                             |  Teodoro Plata.\r\n                             |  Balbino Florentino.\r\n                             |  Bricio Pantas.\r\n                             |  Pantaleon Torres.\r\n            Councillors      +  Jose Trinidad.\r\n                             |  Francisco Carreon.\r\n                             |  Aguedo del Rosario.\r\n                             |  Vicente Molina.\r\n                             |  Alejandro Santiago.\r\n                             \\  Jose T. Santiago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In Tondo existed the popular Council Catagalugan presided over by\r\nAlejandro Santiago; and the sections Cabuhayan, Catotohanan, Pagtibain,\r\nCalingaan and Bagongsilang, presided over by Hilarion Cruz, Braulio\r\nRivera, Cipriano Pacheco, Nicolas Rivera, and Deogracias Fajardo.\r\n\r\n\"In Sta. Cruz the popular Council Laonlaan presided over by Julian\r\nNepomuceno, and the sections Tanglao and Dimas Alang [9] by Procopio\r\nBonifacio and Restituto Javier.\r\n\r\n\"In Trozo the popular Council Dapitan [10] presided over by Francisco\r\nCarreon, and the sections Silanganan and Alapaap, by Juan de la Cruz\r\nand R. Concha.\r\n\r\n\"In Binondo the popular Council Ilog Pasig by Faustino Manalac.\r\n\r\n\"In Concepcion and Dilao (Paco) the popular Council Mahiganti,\r\npresided over by Rafael Gutierrez, and the sections Panday and Ilog\r\nwith a delegation in Ermita.\r\n\r\n\"But why continue? It would not be exaggerating to assert that the\r\nfourth of the native population pertained to the Katipunan, and the\r\ntask of consigning more names would be useless, as nothing new would\r\nbe discovered.\r\n\r\n\"Astounding is the number of the initiated; in Manila and its province\r\nalone they exceed 14,000, and in the provinces of Cavite, Batangas,\r\nLaguna and Nueva Ecija there are no less than 20,000. Adding to\r\nthis number those of the remainder of Luzon, the total will ascend\r\nto an enormous mass of \"illusioned\" who bowed in obedience to an\r\ninquisitous schemer. It must be recognized, however, that Bonifacio\r\nis not a common man; of active character, energetic and bold, gifted\r\nwith a facility of expression in his language which suggested itself\r\nto his countrymen; of a criterion clear but badly cultivated by the\r\nreading of books of an elevated style and a pernicious character [11]\r\nand possessed of an unfathomable ambition--such was the warehouse\r\nporter who had charge of the store house of the foreign commercial\r\nhouse of Fressel and Co. in Calle Nueva, Binondo [12].\r\n\r\n\"His proclamations, pamphlets, and circulars although not a model of\r\nliterature were possessed of a certain amount of culture.\r\n\r\n\"In Calle Clavel, in the dwelling house of Alejandro Santiago, the\r\nKatipunan possessed a secret printing establishment, in which were\r\nprepared many most injurious and insulting publications. There also was\r\nedited and published the paper Kalayaan (Liberty) (93) which only twice\r\nsaw the light and which was supposed to have been printed in Yokohama,\r\n(it bearing the name of that town as the place of publication) and\r\nwas published over the signature of Marcelo H. del Pilar. This was\r\nall false, all studied out for the purpose of throwing dust in the\r\neyes of the local authorities. The paper was edited by Bonifacio, his\r\nbrother-in-law Teodoro Plata and the secretary of the Supreme Council,\r\nEmilio Jacinto, a young student of law, of no scanty intelligence.\r\n\r\n\"On the 19th of August last (1896) the conspiracy was denounced and\r\na great number of imprisonments were made by this Corps. Bonifacio\r\nand those more closely connected with him in his schemes, fled aghast\r\nto the neighboring pueblo of Caloocan and there remained hidden in\r\nthe house of the Capitan Municipal (a native) and in that of the\r\nCapitan Pasado (also a native) Adriano de J, father-in-law to Andres\r\nBonifacio. On the 23rd Bonifacio set out for the barrio of Balintauac,\r\nfollowed by some 200 inhabitants of Caloocan; on the 24th they were\r\ncombatted by the Civil Guard in the fields of the said pueblo and\r\nfled to their former hiding place.\r\n\r\n\"The Supreme Council convoked a large assembly to be held on the\r\nfollowing day in the said barrio, to which gathered more than 500\r\nmembers; there a discussion took place concerning the steps which\r\nwould have to be taken in view of the failure of the conspiracy, and\r\nof the imprisonments which were being made. Some, feeling repentant,\r\ndesired to return to a legal status, submitting to the Spanish\r\nauthority but the president Bonifacio protested, proposing immediate\r\nrebellion. Both propositions were put to the vote, and as a result,\r\nthat of the president gained by an immense majority; so much for the\r\nprestige of Andres Bonifacio! (94).\r\n\r\n\"The orders were circulated with rapidity throughout Manila, Cavite,\r\nNueva Ecija and other provinces, commanding that armed rebellion\r\nshould commence at day-break of Sunday the 30th. The day and hour\r\nassigned finally arrived, and the whole province of Manila broke out;\r\nthe rebels committing a thousand and one abuses and crimes upon as many\r\nEuropeans and loyal natives as were encountered. Like wild beasts they\r\nattacked the waterworks and the powder station situated at San Juan\r\ndel Monte from whence they were valiantly driven back by a section\r\nof artillery and another of the 70th regiment. Simultaneously they\r\nattempted to invade the suburb of Sampaloc by way of Santa Mesa and\r\nthere also they were combatted and dispersed by 60 Veteran Guards\r\nwho prevented, by their defence, a day of mourning for the city of\r\nManila. All Cavite, except the capital, arose in insurrection on\r\nthe afternoon of the 31st., assassinating and disarming the whole\r\nof the Civil Guard of the province, after an heroic defence on the\r\npart of the latter. They assaulted the convents and estates of the\r\nReligious Orders and murdered the defenseless ministers of the Lord\r\n(95). On the 3rd of September the capital of Nueva Ecija was attacked\r\nby large masses of rebels, and the colony [13] and the Civil Guard\r\nheroically resisted until the arrival, from Manila, of a column which\r\ncombatted the enemy and saved that handful of Spaniards from a certain\r\ndeath. But why continue to relate events so well known to all [14].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDENOUNCEMENT OF THE CONSPIRACY AND ITS DISCOVERER.\r\n\r\n\"Teodoro Patino. A name which all Spaniards should pronounce with\r\npleasure, because, by his repentance, inspired by divine Providence\r\n(96), Spain was saved from an unending series of bitter experiences.\r\n\r\n\"Patino, a workman in the printing establishment of the Diario de\r\nManila, pertained to the Katipunan of Tondo, as did also the majority\r\nof the compositors and book binders of the said establishment.\r\n\r\n\"Repentant and fearful of the increase of the association, and of\r\nthe criminal projects it pursued, he decided to denounce it to\r\nhis sister, a student of the College of Looban, directed by the\r\nlearned and virtuous Sisters of Mercy (97). His sister made known\r\nthe denunciation to her Superior who called Patino into her presence;\r\nand realizing the gravity which surrounded the matter, sent him to the\r\nRev. P. Mariano Gil, parish priest of Tondo (98), a suburb of Manila;\r\nto this Rev. Father, Patino repeated all that he had manifested, and\r\nall that he could know, he being only a simple initiated member. He\r\naffirmed that in the printing establishment of the Diario receipts\r\nand proclamations were printed, and daggers were secretly made for\r\nthe Katipunan, and he offered, moreover, to make known where the\r\nlithographic stones used for the printing were hidden.\r\n\r\n\"Srs. Grund and Cortes, lieutenants of the sub-division of the Veterana\r\nof that district, were called to the convent by P. Gil, who expounded\r\nto them all that had occurred. These officers made known the facts to\r\ntheir chiefs, and constituted themselves into a \"cuartelillo\". That\r\nsame night there fell into the power of P. Gil the lithographic stones,\r\nsome receipts and printed regulations of the Katipunan: objects which\r\nwere placed at the disposition of this Corps. In the \"cuartelillo\"\r\nPatino was minutely examined, and immediate proceedings were commenced\r\nfor the arrest of 22 oath bound katipuneros, whose houses were also\r\nsearched. In this search an abundance of documents and effects which\r\njustified the denunciation were encountered. From that time no stone\r\nwas left unturned by the officers and guards of this Corps, who for\r\n15 days worked unceasingly and untiringly that their labor might be\r\ncrowned with the greatest success.\r\n\r\n\"More than 500 prisoners of importance, among those who were convicted\r\nand among those who confessed, were handed over to the Courts of\r\nJustice together with all the documents, books, pamphlets, seals,\r\nattributes and the archives of the Supreme Council. The back of the\r\nvast conspiracy was broken; some of the guilty have already expiated\r\ntheir crimes (99), many have suffered deportation, (100) whilst no\r\nfew still remain in prison awaiting the decision of human justice.\r\n\r\n\"If with our aid we have contributed to the salvation of this portion\r\nof Spanish territory, what better recompense and reward for this\r\nSection of the Guardia Civil Veterana?\r\n\r\n\"Manila, 28th October 1896--Olegario Diaz--Signed--The document bears\r\na seal which reads: Seccion de Guardia Civil Veterana.--Manila.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere ends the document which forms the text. In continuation follow\r\nthe notes with their corresponding numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 NOTES.\r\n\r\n                 These notes are, as regards historical\r\n                   matter, chiefly taken from Spanish\r\n                    official documents drawn up as a\r\n                      result of juridical procee-\r\n                         dings against certain\r\n                          individuals accused\r\n                              of treason.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 2. In that period of time in which the evil effects of freemasonry\r\nbegan to tell upon the public and private life of the government\r\nofficials and upon the morals of the people in general, the Civil\r\nGovernor of Manila, D. Justo Martin Lunas (1886), gave a ball to\r\nwhich the cream of Manila society was invited. Among the selections\r\nfor the evening was an extravagant item, nothing more or less than\r\n... a can-can! This in itself was enough; but what made the matter\r\nso much the worse was that the governor had invited the venerable\r\nArchbishop of Manila to the ball. The news of the innovation spread\r\nfar and wide, and very soon the whole city was in a state of wild\r\nexcitement. In the defense of public morals the Archbishop deemed it\r\nnecessary to issue a pastoral letter condemning such spectacles.\r\n\r\nAlthough not directed at that particular \"school of scandal\", this\r\npastoral was interpreted by all those concerned, as well as by the\r\npublic in general, as a severe lesson for Sr. Lunas and those who\r\nhad gathered in the government house to dance the can-can or to take\r\npleasure therein. Hence Sr. Luna and his party considered themselves\r\noffended, and did not hesitate to take revenge when an opportunity\r\noccurred, upon the aged and infirm Archbishop who did all he had done,\r\nin defense of the morals of his flock.\r\n\r\nFrom this event sprung the seed which gave rise, later on, to the\r\nfamous, or rather infamous manifestation of '88: an insensate campaign\r\ninspired against the Religious Orders by these offended ones and\r\ntheir followers (See note 30).\r\n\r\nThe Civil Governor at that time was D. Jose Centeno y Garcia an active\r\npropagator of freemasonry, holding the 33rd degree. He, together\r\nwith Sr. Quiroja, fostered and godfathered the \"manifestation\". In\r\nthis semi-official insult to Archbishop Payo, an insult so ably\r\nanalysed by Sr. Retana [15], we have one of the best examples that\r\ncould be furnished of the methods adopted by the masonic enemies of\r\nthe Catholic faith in this archipelago. This manifestation, fostered\r\nby a governor who drew down upon himself the righteous ire of all\r\nhonorable men and women by reason of his protection of the houses\r\nof ill-fame in and about the city, was a truly masonic invention by\r\nwhich many, in fact some 98% of those who signed it, were grossly\r\ndeceived. The following notes taken from the analysis of Sr. Retana,\r\nwill give an idea of the real value of the \"manifestation\" and the\r\npart the people had therein. In the Suburb of Sta. Cruz there were\r\n144 people who signed the document, that is to say there were 144\r\nnames. Of these no less than 56 were unknown, 3 were minors and 3 did\r\nnot recognize their signatures; 52 were natives and 8 were Chinese\r\nhalf-castes. In Sampaloc: 61 signatures, all of which were of indians\r\nnone of whom followed trades or professions which necessitated the\r\nuse of brain power. In Malate: 38 signatures, 31 of indians, only 15\r\nof whom understood Spanish. In Binondo: 41, 31 of whom were indians;\r\nfive minors. In Sta. Ana, out of 104, the number of minors was 14,\r\nand 50 did not understand Spanish; 66 were indians. In Caloocan: 80\r\nsignatures of which 55 were indians who did not understand Spanish; 38\r\nwere laborers, 7 were minors. In Navotas: 140 signatures; 49 laborers,\r\nand 49 fishermen; 127 did not understand Spanish. In Mariquina:\r\n68, 38 of whom were laborers, 51 did not understand Spanish. In San\r\nFernando de Dilao (Paco): 35; 6 minors and all indians. In San Mateo,\r\n50 signatures; 39 laborers, 45 indians, 41 of whom did not understand\r\nSpanish. In San Miguel 49; and here comes the crowning piece of the\r\nmagnificent work, for of these 49 no fewer than 16 had died! yes died\r\nprevious to the drawing up of the document and therefore could not\r\npossibly have signed it; moreover 7 did not recognize their signatures,\r\nand all were indians.\r\n\r\nIn recapitulation; there were 810 signatures; of these 85 did not\r\ndeclare on examination, 56 were unknown, 39 were minors, 22 did not\r\nrecognize their signatures and 16 had died previous to the drawing\r\nup of the document (Feb. 20th 1888). This brings the 810 down to\r\n592. Of these 592 signatures 208 were of laborers, 50 of fishermen,\r\n31 of carpenters, 7 washermen and 5 barbers: a total of 301 persons\r\nwhose occupations called for no particular amount of education, and\r\nwhose interest and concern in such a movement as this may be judged\r\nfrom their social standing. Deducting these 301 from the remaining 592\r\nwe have 291 left for further analysis. Of these 25 were of tailors,\r\n4 singers (!) and 3 school masters; 58 escribientes whose occupation\r\nit is to make clean copies of documents and other manuscript, the most\r\nthat can be said of the majority of them being that they can write\r\nwell, not an uncommon thing anyhow for a filipino; 11 of musicians,\r\nmen who lead the life of crickets, enjoying hunger by day and noise\r\nby night; 9 type-setters, men who after having set a dozen columns\r\nof material could not tell you anything of the subject they were\r\ncomposing, in other words, men who like the escribientes reproduce\r\nmechanically without knowing what they are reproducing; this gives us\r\n107 of another grade leaving 184 to be divided among the many odds\r\nand ends of occupations followed by the native to earn his \"fish\r\nand rice\". No less than 384 of the number did not understand Spanish\r\nand 13 could not write. In the matter of races: ONE was a Spaniard,\r\nEnrique Rodriguez de los Palacios who called himself a merchant and\r\nwas domiciled in Binondo. Upon investigation it turned out that he\r\nalso had been fooled and that he had signed the protest because he had\r\nbeen told that other Spaniards had also signed it; as to its contents\r\nhe affirmed that he knew nothing. One was a Spanish mestizo, 66 were\r\nChinese half-castes and 524 were indians. So much for the famous\r\nmanifestation which resulted in giving a most decisive blow to the\r\nmoral and social standing of those who prepared and those who signed\r\nit. Those concerned therein learned the bitter lesson that \"they who\r\ndig pits for their neighbors are apt to fall therein themselves.\"\r\n\r\nThe common opinion has always been that the document in question\r\nwas drawn up by Doroteo Cortes (see note 11) who had on several\r\noccasions been under police vigilance; had been expelled from Navotas\r\nand compelled to reside within the walled city, later on pardoned,\r\nbut still kept under police surveillance. But however that may be,\r\nthe document was infamous in the extreme, and was the precursor of\r\nthe modern campaign against the Religious Orders. From that time to\r\nthis present, this campaign has continued to spread, and is still\r\nbeing fostered by the Federal Party.\r\n\r\nAnother of the advanced ideas which saw the light of day during\r\nthe interim governorship of D. Jose Centeno y Garcia, a 33rd\r\ndegree freemason and a stout republican, was the toleration, for\r\nthe first time in the history of the Archipelago, of houses of\r\nprostitution. Centeno was a governor who, having erred considerably\r\nduring his governorship, attempted some years later to regain public\r\nconfidence by the publication of an insulting pamphlet against the\r\nReligious Orders. This novelty of semi-official houses of ill-fame was,\r\nfor Manila, a most genuine expression of modern democracy. Scandals\r\nuntil then unheard of or undreamed of in Manila, became the order\r\nof the day. White girls imported or inveigled, were hired out by\r\ntheir mistresses to pander to the sensual appetites of blacks, merely\r\nbecause the said black-skinned sensualists were wealthy enough to pay\r\nthe price demanded. What edification! Fundicion street became a centre\r\nin which the scandals daily increased in number and importance. The\r\nnative weaned after many long years of careful training at the hands of\r\nthe Religious Orders, from the vices in which he was found submerged\r\nat the time of the Spanish Conquest, was brought face to face with\r\nthe same scandalous surroundings, introduced by people of the same\r\nwhite race which had removed his forefathers therefrom. Gradually but\r\nsurely this leaven of corruption has eaten its way into the customs\r\nof the people, and to-day we are witnesses of its terrible effects. A\r\ncomparison of the public morals of to-day with those of 20 years or\r\nso ago, would reveal facts which would astound many of those who are\r\nat a loss to account for the reason of the existence of the \"querida\"\r\nevil among so many of the Filipinos of modern Manila. A quarter of\r\na century ago Manila was a paradise to what it is to-day, crimes so\r\ncommon in these days that they are scarcely worth recording, were\r\nunheard of; and even drunkenness was almost entirely confined to\r\nforeign sailors. What Manila is to-day it owes to the advanced and\r\nanti religious ideas introduced by freemasonry and modern democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 3. Separatism, vulgarly called filibusterism, has always,\r\nin the Philippines, been marked by essential characteristics. It\r\nwas always, under the circumstances by which it was surrounded,\r\nnecessarily anti-patriotic. One thing which helped to give it the\r\nrobust life it enjoyed among the middle class of people, was the\r\nsupposition of the existence of a Tagalog civilization anterior\r\nto the discovery of the archipelago by the famous Magallanes. This\r\nfantastic doctrine was preached and propagated principally by two\r\nof the more prominent Filipinos, Pedro Paterno and Jose Rizal. The\r\nformer, much less cultured than Rizal, was the one to whom the most\r\ninsensate ideas on this subject were owing, and this because although\r\nRizal upheld the idea, he was led to do so by his perverse character\r\nrather than by his belief; whilst Paterno really believes in this\r\npre-Spanish civilization, and that to such a degree that many of his\r\nown country-men call him a fool and ridicule him. Another essential\r\nmark was the enmity demonstrated against the Religious Orders. But few,\r\nif any at all of the propagators of the doctrines of separatism labored\r\noutside of the four walls of the masonic lodge room. In other words\r\nthey were freemasons. Masonry was to them a medium through which they\r\nmight carry on their conspiracies; it was an excuse for the creation\r\nof the spirit of association, till then unknown in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nThe aims of separatism may be classed as direct and indirect. The\r\nindirect aim was the independence of the country from the yoke of\r\nSpain. At the best this idea of independence was but second hand,\r\na lesson learned by heart by a scholar whose power of thought was\r\ninsufficient to enable him to grasp the true meaning of the words of\r\nthe lesson. The average Filipino lacks the sentiment of nationality;\r\nhence in the minds of the majority of the people independence is\r\nbut the enjoyment of the unbridled liberty to do as they please,\r\nin fact to revert to the times of their ancestors when everyone who\r\ncould exert an authority was a king, a prince or a ruler of some\r\ndescription. To the Filipino it is of little importance whether his\r\nsovereign or his supreme ruler be the King of Spain or the President\r\nof the U. S. of America, as long as he is protected from his \"friends\"\r\nand from his own country-men and may enjoy his cock-fighting and have\r\nthe necessary supply of rice and fish for his daily sustenance.\r\n\r\nThe direct aims of the separatists were those they sought in public,\r\nviz: representation in the Spanish Cortes, the expulsion of the\r\nReligious Orders, etc., etc. The result of representation in the Cortes\r\nwould have been a veritable comedy; that of the expulsion of the Friars\r\na decided tragedy for Spain, in as much as the Religious was ever the\r\nbackbone of the administration of the colony. The consequences of the\r\nindependence of the country would have been equally disastrous. There\r\nwould have been the tremendous preponderance of the black over the\r\nwhite and eventually inter-tribal disputes and even armed struggles\r\nfor the mastery. This would entail the complete stagnation of the\r\nmoral and material progress of the people, who would gradually but\r\nsurely drift back into the savage ways of their ancestors. And at\r\nlast, who knows but that Japan or perhaps China would have to step\r\nin to save the inhabitants from becoming cannibals.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine of separatism was the doctrine disseminated by Filipino\r\nmasonry, a daughter of Spanish freemasonry. Filipino freemasonry\r\nhowever, was to a great extent addicted to views not held or sustained\r\nby the Gr. Or. Espanol, and hence did not make common cause with\r\nUniversal Freemasonry, although it used its ritual, its signs and\r\nits name, to shield from public view those of its labors which could\r\nnot be allowed to see the light of day. Hence the diving into the\r\nsubject of Universal Freemasonry is somewhat irrelevant to our present\r\nstudy, suffice it to say that the brotherhood, universal as it is,\r\nsuffers no other division than that into families. Its aim is one;\r\nits methods one; its doctrine one [16]; it is the worldly imitation\r\nof the unparalleled Catholic unity of divine foundation.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish family was founded in 1811 by the Count de\r\nGrasse-Tilley. On the 21st of February 1804 the Supreme Council\r\nof Charleston issued a circular to the Count in which it said\r\namong other things which demonstrate the aim of the foundation:\r\n\"Above the idea of country is the idea of humanity\"; \"frontiers are\r\ncapricious demarcations imposed by the use of force.\" And others of\r\nthe same nature.\r\n\r\nWhen the Count set forth to found the Spanish Supreme Council he was\r\narmed with a letters patent issued by the Supreme Council of Charleston\r\ncontaining this sentence: \"the masonic solidity will never be effective\r\nwhilst the brethren do not recognize one only power, as is one only\r\nthe earth we inhabit, and one also the horizon we contemplate.... To\r\nunify, therefore, the masonic labors we all journey to the one end to\r\nwhich the work of this Supreme Council is directed, and hence what\r\nwe have pointed out to Spain as one of the points in which is more\r\nnecessary than elsewhere the one direction to which we refer.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1882 Spanish freemasons were divided into different Orientes each\r\nof which claimed continuity with the institution of Grasse-Tilley;\r\nthe matter was finally settled by the Supreme Council of Charleston.\r\n\r\nOpinion is divided on the question of the responsibility of the\r\nSpanish freemason lodges or rather the ruling \"Oriente\" for the\r\nbeliefs and practices of their filipino brethren. That they were\r\nindirectly responsible is more than certain; and oft-times they were\r\nso indirectly. D. Manuel Sastron ex-Deputy to the Spanish Cortes,\r\nex-Civil Governor of the Philippines, speaking on this subject says:\r\n\"It is not possible for us on any account to fall in line with these\r\nsuspicious reasonings: never have we had a disposition to form a part\r\nof such a sect, because we are old time Christians; but we repeat that\r\nwe cannot believe nor do we imagine that any masonic centre composed of\r\npeninsular Spaniards could tolerate, and much less foment consciously,\r\nthe propagation of doctrines which, whatever masonry brought about\r\nin the Philippines, could have given origin to the congregation of\r\nseparatist elements.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless side by side with this firm conviction we repeat\r\nwhat we tersely maintained, viz: that freemasonry has been the\r\nmedium which marshalled the element which generalled the Filipino\r\ninsurrection. Filibusterism knew how to exploit it to a fine point.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We do not find it inconvenient to affirm, but just the opposite, we\r\nrepeat with pleasure and absolute belief that Spanish freemasonry was\r\nignorant of the true ends of the Filipino masons. But it is proved to\r\nour way of thinking, to the point of evidence, that Filipino masonry\r\npursued no other ends than the independence of those islands (the\r\nPhilippines.)\" [17]\r\n\r\nIt must be noted that this is the opinion of a Spanish patriot, for\r\na patriot Sastron certainly was, and what is more natural than that\r\na true patriot should doubt the possibility of his own countrymen\r\nmixing themselves up in anti-patriotic movements: Yet while Sastron\r\nand other writers would redeem their fellow countrymen from such a\r\nstain as that of treason, I am inclined to believe that the asserted\r\nignorance of the Spanish freemason was too often official, that is\r\nto say it was not genuine, but limited to the members of the society\r\nwho enjoyed the privileges of the lower degrees.\r\n\r\nThere are two sides to every question, however, and that the \"other\r\nside\" may be given a fair hearing, I will quote a declaration of\r\nAntonio Luna on this subject. Luna, among the many statements made\r\nbefore the Lieut. Col. in command of the Cuartel de Caballeria, on the\r\n8th of October 1896, confessed that \"in the year 1890 or 91, of his\r\nown free-will, he formed a masonic project based on Spanish masonry:\r\na project which might, at its proper time be applied to filibuster\r\nconspiracy. This project was discussed and approved by the Oriente\r\nEspanol in Madrid; but that center did not know the secondary ends\r\nto which it would be applied.... Of his own free-will he manifested\r\nthat his ideas were, when he formed the project, anti-Spanish....\"\r\n\r\nWith rare exceptions the Filipinos who left their native soil to\r\nfinish their education in the Spanish peninsula, were those to whom\r\nthe real work of separatism is owing. The Filipino at home who has\r\nfallen into line with his foreign educated brother is but a blind\r\nworker. And the Filipino who went to Spain was as a rule, a very\r\ngeneral rule, taken under the sheltering care of Miguel Morayta (see\r\nnote 13). The responsibility therefore for the ideas inculcated into\r\nthe minds of those \"students\" lies, and that heavily, upon Morayta,\r\nthe chief of that family of freemasonry which claims ignorance of the\r\naims of its filipino membership. The only logical excuse that can be\r\nbrought forwards is that filipino freemasonry degenerated. When once it\r\ntook root in the Archipelago it spread with wonderful rapidity. The\r\nadepts were for the most part Chinese half-castes; and little by\r\nlittle that strange train of thought of the native, whether he be\r\nfull blooded or mixed, a train of thought which, like the filipino\r\npony is accustomed to walk backwards when it should go forwards,\r\nor like the patient carabao which too often lies down just at the\r\nmoment when its services are the most needed to drag a load over a\r\nmud hole, carried the would-be citizens of an independent country to\r\nthe verge of political insanity. Certain it is that as the idea of\r\nseparation became more and more developed the Spanish masons who were\r\nmember of the Filipino lodges severed their connection therewith. But\r\nyet it does not appear within the limits of common sense to believe\r\nthat the Spanish masons were ignorant; the greater probability is\r\nthat they were too indulgent, too confiding. To hold too fast to the\r\nexcuse of ignorance is to profess oneself very ignorant. But whether\r\nit was ignorance or the wanting of even that species of patriotism\r\nwhich one expects to find in beasts of burden (for every horse knows\r\nhis own stables) the black fact still remains that Spanish masonry\r\ngave birth to, and fostered, Filipino freemasonry or in other words,\r\nthe katipunan.\r\n\r\nHowever, be the degree of ignorance what it may, we cannot overlook\r\nthe fact that the actions of the Tagalog freemasons, the katipunan\r\nif you will, for the one and the other are the same thing under\r\ndifferent names, were the cause of no little surprise to the Grand\r\nOriente Espanol. The filipino mason was a traitor to the mother which\r\ngave him being and nourished him into activity: a traitor who used\r\nthe cover of the freemason lodge only that he might the easier and\r\nsafer hatch out his plot to gain, by the most brutal means imaginable,\r\nthe independence of his country.\r\n\r\nIn his declaration made in the presence of Colonel Francisco Olive\r\ny Garcia and others on the 23rd of September 1896, Moises Salvador\r\nFrancisco, of Quiapo (Manila) stated that \"in April 1891 he came to\r\nManila bringing with him a copy of the agreements arrived at by the\r\nJunta of Madrid, and these he handed over to Timoteo Paez to see if\r\nmasonic lodges could be established as a commencement of the work. In\r\nthe following year of 1892 Pedro Serrano arrived from Spain and then\r\nMasonry (native) was introduced into the Philippines, the first lodge\r\ninstituted being the Nilad.\"\r\n\r\nTo give some idea of the separatist aims which gave life and\r\nnourishment to the Tagalog revolt, I will quote a few extracts taken\r\nfrom masonic documents, and from the declarations, made by persons\r\ncomplicated in the conspiracy. These declarations were made in the\r\npresence of the appointed judge, Col. D. Francisco Olive y Garcia,\r\nand others, and are of capital interest in the study of the rise and\r\nfall of the filipino \"commune\".\r\n\r\nThe citations are as follows:\r\n\r\nI. In an act of Session of the Katipunan Sur at the commencement of\r\nthe year 1896, the session being opened, the president don Agustin\r\nTantoko, a native priest [18], invited the membership present to\r\nexpress its opinion concerning the questions proposed, viz: how\r\nought we to act towards society; towards ourselves; and how ought\r\nwe to act in case of surprise. Mariano Kalisan considered, dealing\r\nwith the first question, that \"as their principal object was not to\r\nleave alive any Spaniard in all the future Filipino republic\" they\r\nshould procure to make friends with them as much as possible in order\r\nto be able to carry out their plans with more surety when the time\r\nshould arrive to give the cry of independence. D. Gabino Tantoko,\r\nbrother of the president, considered that the said principle should\r\nbe carried out especially in dealing with the members of the Religious\r\nOrders. Both propositions were accepted.\r\n\r\nAs regards the second question, Epifanio Ramos proposed that meetings\r\nshould be held as seldom as possible \"in order to avoid scandals\".\r\n\r\nIn case of surprise, Hermenegildo Garcia considered that \"the\r\nstrongest fort lay in denial.\" The brothers Tantoko remarked that such\r\nsurprise was almost impossible seeing that they had determined \"not\r\nto leave alive any of those who might surprise them.\" The president\r\nmoreover remarked that, from that time forward, in case of danger,\r\n\"they should destroy all the papers they held in their power, such\r\nas acts, receipts, letters, plans and especially the arms they held,\r\nin case the blow they were to deal in Manila should not succeed.\" This\r\nwas accepted unanimously.\r\n\r\nIn reply to a question, the president affirmed that \"all the sections\r\nof Katipunan existing in the future Filipino republic pursued the\r\nsame end: viz: the independence of the Filipino people, the release\r\nfrom the yoke of the step-mother [19] Spain.\"\r\n\r\nII. In a document dated the 12th of June 1896 and giving instructions\r\nto those who should carry out the proposed slaughter of all the\r\nSpaniards in Manila, we read:\r\n\r\n\"2nd. Once the signal is given every bro. shall fulfill the duty\r\nimposed upon him by this Gr. Reg. Log. without considerations of any\r\nkind, neither of parentage, friendship nor of gratitude, etc.\"\r\n\r\n\"4th. The blow having been struck at the Captain General and the other\r\nSpanish Authorities, the loyals shall attack the convents and shall\r\nbehead their infamous inhabitants, respecting the wealth contained\r\nin the said convents; this shall be gathered ... etc.\"\r\n\r\n\"6th. On the following day the bbro. designated shall bury all the\r\nbodies of their hateful oppressors in the field of Bagumbayan together\r\nwith their wives and children, and on the site shall later on be raised\r\na monument commemorative of the independence of the G. N. F. (Gran\r\nNacion Filipina).\"\r\n\r\n\"7th. The bodies of the members of the Religious Orders shall not be\r\nburied, but burned in just payment for the felonies (sic) which they\r\ncommitted during life against the Filipino nation during the three\r\nhundred years of their nefarious domination.\" [20]\r\n\r\nThis infamous document is signed by the president of the\r\nexecutive commission by the Gr. Mast. adj. Giordano Bruno, and the\r\nGr. Sec. Galileo. [21]\r\n\r\nIII. In his declaration made before Col. Olive y Garcia, the second\r\nLieutenant D. Benedicto Nijaga y Polonis, a native of Carbeyeng,\r\nprovince of Samar, stated that the conspiracy was entered into for\r\nthe purpose of securing from Spain, by peaceful means, or by the\r\nprocess of revolution, the independence of the country. He affirmed\r\nmoreover that, in the case of revolution, the aid of Japan was to be\r\nsought and that the co-operation of the native troops was expected:\r\nand that the plan of campaign of the rebels who were in San Mateo,\r\nwas to \"fall upon Manila\", the native infantry sent out to meet the\r\nattack to pass over to the rebel ranks.\r\n\r\nIV. In his declaration made in Manila before the same judge, Pio\r\nValenzuela y Alejandrino stated that he was one of the members of the\r\nInterior Supreme Council of the Katipunan, the aim of which was to\r\ncollect a large amount of money and promote a general rising in order\r\nto declare the independence of the islands under the protectorate\r\nof the Empire of Japan. Further on he stated that the rising was to\r\nhave taken place at 7 o'clock p. m. on the 29th of August, entry being\r\nmade into Manila and its suburbs, the rebels \"killing the Spaniards,\r\nand the natives and Chinese who did not wish to follow them, and\r\nthen devoting themselves to the sacking of the town, to robbery and\r\nincendiarism and the violation of women.\"\r\n\r\nV. Romualdo de J., sculptor of Sta. Cruz, Manila, declared that he had\r\nfounded the Katipunan in 1888, the year in which the manifestation\r\nagainst the Archbishop was made; he defined the aim of the society\r\nto be \"the killing of all the Spaniards and the taking possession of\r\nthe islands.\"\r\n\r\nVI. In his declaration made in Cavite, September 3, 1896, Alfonso\r\nOcampo affirmed that according to the plans formulated, they\r\nwere \"to make the assault, killing and robbing all the peninsular\r\nSpaniards.\" And moreover, that \"the rebellion had for its object the\r\nassassination of all the peninsular Spaniards, the violation and\r\nbeheading afterwards of their wives and of their children even to\r\nthe youngest.\"\r\n\r\nMany others might be cited; with these six samples an idea may be\r\ngathered of the progressive idea advocated or fostered by Rizal,\r\nPilar, Lopez, Ponce, the Lunas, Rosario, Cortes, and others who were\r\ninspired by Morayta, the Grand Master of the Gran Oriente Espanol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 4. The then Civil Governor of Manila, in a report to the Colonial\r\nMinister concerning what was taking place in Manila says, speaking\r\nof this Corps:\r\n\r\n\"... this Corps of Vigilance which, although composed of no more than\r\n45 persons including the inspectors of the same ... renders a service\r\n(to the Government in secret service work) which should be confided\r\nto 100 persons, considering the nature and the amount of the work\r\nundertaken and performed daily, from the day of the formation of the\r\nCorps to this day: a period of about a year. The interesting body of\r\npolice which under my orders has performed such valuable services,\r\nis that which has attained greatest success in the fruitful labor of\r\nmaking clear the vandalistic events we have been experiencing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 5. Filibusters: more properly called separatists. Noah Webster\r\ndescribes a filibuster as a \"lawless military adventurer, especially\r\none in quest of plunder; a free-booter, a pirate.\" Hence, taken\r\nin its true meaning, the word does not apply to the separatists of\r\nthe Philippines. Retana classifies the filibuster in three groups:\r\nthe first: he who, thinking little or nothing of the independence\r\nof his country, showed more or less aversion to the peninsular\r\nSpaniards. 2. He who, under the pretext or without it, of illustrating\r\nhis countrymen, inculcated into their minds political ideas which,\r\nwithout meriting the qualification of subversive, tended to incite\r\nthem against supposed oppressions of the Spaniards; against all\r\nthings which appeared behind the times, hence according to their way\r\nof arguing, against the Religious Corporations, to which they owed\r\neverything except their anti-Spaniardism. As a rule those belonging\r\nto this group professed great love for the mother-country and did\r\nnot preach ideas of independence; they held the belief that theirs\r\nwas the duty to prepare the way for the emancipation which should\r\nbe attained by their grandchildren. And 3. Those whose aim was to\r\nattain the emancipation of their country as soon as possible. This\r\nlatter group were the true separatists. It is however difficult to\r\ndistinguish between the filibuster so called, and the true separatist;\r\nperhaps the only admissible distinction is that the separatist is a man\r\nof peaceful methods whilst the filibuster is a man of struggles. Rizal\r\nwas more or less a separatist, Andres Bonifacio a veritable filibuster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 6. Sr. Olive was a gentleman who well deserved the respect and\r\nhonor paid to him by his nation, and the hatred of those whose plans of\r\ntreachery he thwarted and who, in spiteful revenge, have gone so far as\r\nto accuse him of using torture and other forcible means of extorting\r\nconfessions, many of which they claim to have been false. Sr. Olive\r\nwas too kind-hearted a man to stoop to such methods even had the\r\ncircumstances demanded the use of moderate physical persuasion.\r\n\r\nAt one time Sr. Olive was the Governor of the Marianas Islands\r\nconcerning the which he wrote and published a very interesting\r\nmemoir. He was at that time Lieut. Colonel.\r\n\r\nLater on he was made Colonel and as such was placed at the head of\r\none of the sections of the Guardia Civil of Manila. He was secretary\r\nof the sub-inspection of arms of the Philippines. When a state of\r\nwar was declared, the charges which were at that time being prepared\r\nin connection with the insurrection, were handed over to Sr. Olive,\r\nwho with a zeal worthy of praise, and an energy too seldom exerted,\r\ncommenced to deal out strict justice to the enemies of their\r\ncountry. About a year and a half ago Sr. Olive was made General\r\nof Brigade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 7. According to a pamphlet written by a pseudonymous freemason and\r\nprinted in Paris in 1896, the first lodge founded in the Philippines\r\nwas that established in Cavite about 1860 under the name of Luz\r\nFilipina and subject to the Gr. Or. Lusitian, enjoying immediate\r\ncorrespondence with the Portuguese lodges of Macao and Hong-Kong\r\nwhich served as intermediaries between that lodge and those of other\r\nneighboring countries.\r\n\r\nAnother statement however, from the pen of Sr. Nicolas Diaz y Perez\r\nwho formed his data from the original documents of the lodges, places\r\nthe first foundation at the end of the year 1834. At this time,\r\nsays Sr. Diaz, D. Mariano Marti, who died twenty-seven years later,\r\nwhilst on his return to Spain, founded, together with others, lodges\r\nin various parts of the Archipelago, but they did not prosper and soon\r\ndissolved. The epoch of intrigues which produced so much disquietude\r\nand perversion of moral customs and ideas, more especially in the\r\nTagal provinces, commenced about 1868. The masonic activity at that\r\ntime was owing greatly to the political intriguers who were deported\r\nfrom Spain to this archipelago, where their influence was felt in no\r\nsmall degree, to the detriment of public morals.\r\n\r\nAbout 1872, during the interim government of Gen. Blanco Valderrama,\r\na lodge was founded in Sampaloc, subject to the Gr. Or. Esp.,\r\nand composed entirely of peninsular Spaniards with the exclusion\r\nof natives.\r\n\r\nIn the same year D. Rufino Pascual Torrejon reached Manila and united\r\nhis efforts to those of Marti, founding lodges purely Spanish.\r\n\r\nOn the first of March 1874 was created the lodge \"Luz de Oriente\" under\r\nthe obedience of the Gr. Or. de Esp., the Gr. Comend. being D. Juan\r\nde la Somera. This was really the first successful establishment of\r\nmasonry in the Philippines. The cited Sr. Diaz y Perez says on this\r\npoint; \"It may be said that freemasonry regularly constituted in the\r\nPhilippines, dates from the 1st. of March 1874, with the creation of\r\nthe lodge Luz de Oriente....\"\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of March 1875 was installed the Gr. L. Departmental,\r\nD. Rufino Pascual Torrejon being the Gr. President.\r\n\r\nUp to the year 1884 the lodges of the Philippines did not admit to\r\ntheir membership either indians or half-castes; but since that time,\r\nand upon the initiative of the Gr. Mast. of the Gr. Or. Esp. the doors\r\nof the lodges were opened to all indians and half-castes who could read\r\nor write. Later on purely native lodges were founded and from that time\r\nSpain lost, little by little but surely, her hold upon the people,\r\nwith the result that she eventually lost her colony. What masonry\r\nhas accomplished in other parts of the world it also accomplished\r\nhere very effectually. It laid the foundation for the undermining of\r\nsociety, bringing forth a generation of traitors and building up a\r\nkingdom for anti-Christ.\r\n\r\nAs has been proved over and over again by the many masonic documents\r\nwhich have been discovered, freemasonry was ever anti-Catholic\r\nin the Philippines; but it was not until it had degenerated into\r\nfilibusterism that the anti-Spanish spirit really took shape. Year\r\nby year this spirit spread and more, especially among the natives\r\nand half-castes of less intellectual capacity. Among this element,\r\nseparatist ideas spread with marvelous rapidity owing to the\r\npeculiarity of the character of the native and of the half-caste,\r\nmore especially the Chinese half-caste. (See note 19).\r\n\r\nUp to 1890, even Filipino masonry enjoyed but insignificant\r\ndevelopment. By 1892, however, it had spread widely, and in the\r\nfollowing year Manila was gifted with a female lodge founded on the\r\n18th of July of that year, under the name of \"La Semilla\", of which\r\nRosario Villareal, the daughter of Faustino Villareal, was declared\r\nthe Ven. Gr. Mistress.\r\n\r\nFrom this time the element of politico-social decomposition\r\ngained ground among the native and half-caste population. New ideas\r\ncontinually gave place to the old and as the aims and purposes of the\r\nlodges degenerated, these centers of anti-catholic propaganda became\r\nmore and more anti-Spanish.\r\n\r\nIsabelo de los Reyes, in an attempted defense of his \"friends\",\r\nmakes the important confession that \"Filipino freemasonry was not so\r\ninoffensive as it was believed.... The \"Liga\" at least was a school of\r\nconspiracy, and in truth, the Filipinos did not turn out bad pupils.\"\r\n\r\nAnother demonstration of the inoffensiveness of freemasonry is the\r\nfollowing series of facts taken from a pamphlet published in 1896 in\r\nParis by Antonio Regidor under the pseudonym of Francisco Engracio\r\nVergara. Regidor was a distinguished figure in the attempted revolt\r\nof 1872, and hence may justly be supposed to know something of the\r\nmatter of which he speaks. He says:\r\n\r\n\"By reason of the rising of Cavite many Filipinos characterized as\r\nprogressives were deported to Marianas.... To the masons of Hong-Kong\r\nwas owing the flight of several Filipinos....\"\r\n\r\n\"The foreign masons distributed arms in Negros, Mindanao and Jolo. The\r\nofficial bank of Singapore distributed in Cebu, Leyte and Bohol over\r\nL80,000 stg., and that of Hong-Kong more than L200,000 in Panay and\r\nNegros.... The French freemasons at the petition of brother Paraiso,\r\nwent to aid also the escape of the deported in Marianas.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 8. Rizal and others: Of this group Rizal, Pilar, the Lunas and\r\nCortes, formed the more guilty part, they being men of superior\r\neducation and more enlightened minds. Rizal was the center upon\r\nwhich almost everything connected with the revolt turned. During\r\nhis younger days he lived with his parents in Calamba, where they\r\noccupied a stretch of land owned by the Dominican Corporation. The\r\nRizal family was one of those most favored by the Dominicans [22],\r\nand one of those ungrateful ones too, which commenced law-suit against\r\nthe said Corporation to unjustly possess themselves of the land they\r\nheld at rent.\r\n\r\nRizal received his secondary education at the Ateneo Municipal\r\nconducted by the Jesuit Fathers, and was always a bright attentive and\r\nsuccessful pupil. At that time he was secretary of the Sodality of the\r\nBlessed Virgin and Promoter of the Apostleship of Prayer. Whilst he\r\nremained true to the traditions of Catholic Spain, he was an upright\r\npious youth. Much of his time he spent in carving wooden images of the\r\nBlessed Virgin and of the Sacred Heart, and in writing compositions,\r\nsome of them remarkable for their beauty, in which were reflected a\r\npure love for Spain.\r\n\r\nHaving attained the degree of Bachelor he left the Ateneo and passed to\r\nthe University of Manila, continuing his studies under the Dominican\r\nFathers. There he studied medicine with great success for some years,\r\nand at length went to Europe to terminate his career and take his\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\nRizal left school like so many other filipino students, overloaded\r\nwith science he was unable to direct, full of pride because of his\r\naccomplishments, and very ambitious. He terminated his studies in\r\nMadrid and Germany, in both of which places he fell in with a class\r\nof people who utilized him as a tool to accomplish an end at that\r\ntime unknown to him. They filled his head with new and false ideas,\r\nmaking him vain promises which appealed to his pride, and by their\r\ndark arts made of him a separatist. He also studied English and\r\nGerman, his studies in this latter language making him enthusiastic\r\nin the things of Germany and, in an extraordinary degree, with those\r\nof protestantism.\r\n\r\nAmong his own people he was the possessor of an exceptional\r\nintelligence and talent but outside his own circle his most famous\r\naccomplishments are but poor to the student of Literature. His sadly\r\nfamous Noli me tangere and El Filibusterismo cannot pass for more\r\nthan very second-hand for their ingenuity and literary taste, but\r\nthey possess the quality of being a mirror in which is reflected the\r\ninclinations, character and perverse moral sense of their author. In\r\nthem he is reflected as a restless spirit anxious for human glory,\r\nhaughty and above all, anti-Spanish and ungrateful in the extreme.\r\n\r\nIt was in Berlin that he published his Noli in 1886. That this novel\r\nwas written by Rizal there in no doubt, but that the ideas therein\r\nexpressed came directly from his own head is more than doubtful. Like\r\nthe vast majority of Filipino productions, it is but a copy taken\r\nfrom models which had struck the fancy of the author. The pictures\r\nhe draws therein of the disadvantages suffered by the Filipinos who\r\nhave become espanolized, are but reproductions prepared in his own\r\ncoarse and crude way of thinking, of the most scurrilous anti-Spanish\r\nand anti-Catholic works of propaganda produced by the Bible Societies\r\nand spread abroad throughout the world as gospel truth. Taking away\r\nthe insults hurled against the Church and the Religious Orders,\r\nand against Spain, there is absolutely nothing new in the novel. Its\r\nobject was to attack the friars and the chiefs of the Guardia Civil,\r\nboth of which the author well knew to be the sustainment and guarantee\r\nof peace and order in the Archipelago and consequently the strongest\r\nsupport of the Spanish sovereignty in the Philippines, a sovereignty\r\nhe wished to overthrow. To a reader whose library consists of a half\r\na dozen books of insignificant literary value, the noli of Rizal is a\r\nmasterpiece; but to the reader who has seen a book with a cover, who\r\nhas had some experience of that portion of the world which lies outside\r\nthe limits of the town of his birth, and who is gifted with more or\r\nless ability to think for himself, and sift the wheat from the straw\r\nin a literary composition, noli me tangere is but a half-tone picture\r\ncut from a newspaper and colored with water-colors by a ... school-boy.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of 1887, Rizal returned to the Archipelago, remaining\r\nabout two months, during the which he made active propaganda of the\r\nideas and fancies he had picked up in Europe: ideas which he himself\r\ncould not really understand.\r\n\r\nIn February 1888 he left Manila for Japan, from whence he returned\r\nto Europe, living for a while in Paris and later on in London.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 Rizal, relying upon the generous character of D. Eulogio\r\nDespujols, the then Governor General of the Archipelago, decided\r\nto return to Manila. From Hong-Kong where he was then residing, he\r\nwrote to the governor, asking permission to return to his home; the\r\nGovernor replied by means of the Spanish Consul at Hong-Kong, that\r\nhe had no reason to prohibit him from returning, and that he could\r\ndo so when it so pleased him, providing he came with no intention to\r\ndisturb the peace then reigning in the Islands.\r\n\r\nThis Rizal lost no time in doing; he arrived together with his\r\nsister. The baggage of both was carefully examined and in one of the\r\ntrunks was discovered a bundle of leaflets in the form of anti-friar\r\nproclamations which indicated the bad faith of a traitor. These were\r\nhanded over to Despujols unknown to Rizal. The Governor preserved\r\nthem in his desk for future reference. In an interview with the\r\nGovernor, Rizal begged pardon for his father who was under sentence\r\nof deportation for certain events which had taken place in Calamba;\r\nthis was granted him without reserve.\r\n\r\nOur hero soon forgot the aims he professed to the Governor; instead\r\nof thinking about his folks and making his arrangements for the\r\ncolonizing scheme he professed to have worked out in Borneo, he set\r\nto work to stir up disrespect towards the authorities, and the spirit\r\nof political unrest. He together with Doroteo Cortes and Jose Basa\r\nwere the objects of careful vigilance on the part of the secret police.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days a prolonged conference took place between the Governor\r\nGeneral and Rizal. During this conference the latter made patent his\r\npolitical feelings, at the same time making protestations of respect\r\nfor Spain. His political programme however was not in keeping with\r\nhis protestations of patriotism, and this fact so angered Despujols,\r\nwho now saw that Rizal's idea was to fool him, that he took from his\r\ndrawer the proclamations discovered in the agitator's baggage and\r\nthrusting them under the nose of the traitor, said:\r\n\r\n--And these proclamations; what are they, what do they mean?\r\n\r\nRizal taken by surprise and confounded, cowardly declared that they\r\nwere the property of his sister, a declaration which only enraged\r\nthe General the more, and he ordered his detention in Fort Santiago;\r\non the following day he decreed his deportation to Dapitan.\r\n\r\nWhilst in exile his opinion and advice were sought concerning the\r\nadvisability of immediate armed rebellion. But he, crafty, more or\r\nless far seeing and, above all, jealous of Bonifacio's increasing\r\nascendancy over the people, refused to countenance the idea. Granting\r\nthe unselfish desire he professed of seeking merely the independence\r\nof his country, Rizal's jealousy was justified. Bonifacio's one\r\ngreat idea was the presidency; Rizal's: the honor and glory of having\r\nprepared the way for, and eventually, by his labors accomplishing his\r\ncountry's deliverance from what he was pleased to call the oppression\r\nof the Spanish Government. Had such oppression existed, Rizal's idea\r\nwould have been worthy of classifying as noble. George Washington well\r\ndeserved the name of the \"Father of his Country,\" for he, laying aside\r\nall selfish aims and desires, led a handful of men against a horde of\r\nmercenaries sent by a cruel monarch who oppressed his people, not only\r\nin the colonies but in the mother-country also. Washington was a man\r\nwho deserved and received the respect of those against whom he fought,\r\nfor he fought for a principle. Such an honor never has, and never\r\ncan be received by Rizal from his own countrymen. The campaign Rizal\r\nfought was inspired by and worked out in the freemason lodges which\r\nused our \"hero\" as a willing tool. Rizal was a Filipino Garibaldi,\r\nnever a Filipino Washington, and hence the honors paid to his memory\r\nas a \"patriot\" must emanate from the lodge rooms which made him what\r\nhe was, and not from the people of his country.\r\n\r\nIn Dapitan the Filipino agitator was not inactive. On one occasion\r\nhe directed a letter (which never reached its destination on account\r\nof its having fallen into the hands of Spanish authorities) to the\r\nCapitan Municipal of the province of Batangas, giving him information\r\nof the work of filibusterism which was at that time being carried on.\r\n\r\nRizal, tiring of his position in Dapitan, eventually asked permission\r\nof the Governor General, Gen. Blanco, to be sent to Cuba as physician\r\nto the Spanish forces there. Blanco agreed to the proposition and\r\nordered his return to Manila in preparation for the voyage to Spain,\r\nwhere he was to be sent and placed at the disposition of the Minister\r\nof War.\r\n\r\nFrom Spain came word, however, that the petition could not be accepted;\r\nand for a very good reason. Rizal's idea of becoming an army surgeon,\r\nwas a manifest pretence, his real aim was to aid the separatist\r\nmovement there, if he ever got there, but primarily to make his\r\nescape at an intermediate port, Singapore probably, if opportunity\r\noccurred. Moreover, it having come to the ears of the authorities that\r\ncertain people of Pampanga and Bulacan were preparing a reception for\r\nthe agitator, the Governor ordered that he should not be allowed to\r\nleave Dapitan, and that should he have left there, he should not be\r\nallowed to land in Manila on his arrival, but be transferred to another\r\nship which should carry him back to Mindanao. It happened that he had\r\nleft Dapitan on board the S. S. Espana, and in due time he arrived\r\nat Manila. At 11 a. m. on the 6th of August the ship on which he came\r\nanchored in the bay and everyone landed except Rizal. A lieutenant of\r\nthe Veterana went aboard and took possession of the person of Rizal,\r\nholding him as a prisoner till 7:30 p. m., at which time, through an\r\nerror in the delivery of an order, he was allowed to disembark. This he\r\ndid in company with his sister Narcisa, and they made their way to the\r\noffice of the Captain of the Port and later on to the Comandancia of\r\nthe Veterana. His sister not having been under sentence of deportation,\r\nwas allowed to go to the home of her relatives.\r\n\r\nDuring the evening of the same day Gen. Blanco gave a reception\r\nat Malacanang at which were present the Archbishop of Manila, the\r\nIllust. Sr. Bernardino Nozaleda; Sr. Echaluce; Sr. Fernandez Victorio,\r\nPresident of Audiencia; Sr. Bores Romero, the Civil Director and\r\nothers. During the reception Gen. Blanco received a telegram from the\r\nGovernor of the province of Batangas stating that in the pueblo of\r\nTaal, in the house of the brother of the filibuster Felipe Agoncillo,\r\nhad been discovered a quantity of arms and ammunition, among other\r\nthings being 10 revolvers, 10 winchesters, 10 other guns, a case of\r\nexplosive bullets, a quantity of dynamite, a Japanese flag, another\r\ncomposed of red and blue with a representation of the sun in the\r\ncenter surrounded by seven stars--the flag of the future Filipino\r\nrepublic. Blanco realizing the importance of the news, formed a\r\ncommittee from among those present, choosing those who were members\r\nof the Junta of Authorities, to take steps in the matter. Orders were\r\nimmediately given that Rizal should be placed on board the cruiser\r\nCastilla which was stationed at Cavite; this was carried out, the\r\nstart from Manila being made at 11 p. m. the same night. This action\r\nwas considered necessary, in as much as the news of the landing of\r\nRizal spread fast and caused no little stir among his followers.\r\n\r\nWhilst Rizal was on board the cruiser Castilla which was awaiting\r\norders, the Katipunan revolt broke out in Manila and the suburbs. Very\r\nsoon afterwards his voyage Spainwards was commenced on board the\r\nS. S. Colon, the insurrection becoming more and more wide-spread\r\ndaily. On finding to what an extent Rizal was complicated in the\r\nwork of the revolution, his return to the Archipelago, as a prisoner,\r\nwas demanded, and so our \"hero\" returned to be judged as were so many\r\nof his fellow agitators, for the crimes for which he was morally and\r\nphysically responsible.\r\n\r\nA council of war was constituted under the presidency of\r\nLieut. Col. Tabares, Capt. Tavil de Andrade taking charge of the\r\ndefense of the prisoner. The accusation preferred against him was that\r\nhe was the chief organizer of the revolution. The trial took place in\r\nthe hall of the Cuartel de Espana in the presence of a large audience\r\namong whom were his sister and the woman with whom he had been living\r\nin Dapitan. The charge having been read out, several declarations were\r\nmade by Rizal, some before his voyage to Spain and others since his\r\nreturn were also read. During his trial Rizal denied the knowledge\r\nof several persons who were his intimate friends and co-workers;\r\namong them Maximo Inocencio and Mariano Linjap, and others with whom\r\nhe had been in almost continual communication. He denied knowledge\r\nof the \"Liga Filipina\" stating that not only did he not found it,\r\nbut that he was not aware of its existence. He affirmed ignorance of\r\nwho Valenzuela was, and almost immediately afterwards stated that he\r\nhad held an interview with him in Dapitan when that individual had\r\nbeen sent there by Bonifacio to consult him on the subject of armed\r\nrebellion. Throughout the whole trial he pursued the same tactics,\r\nproving that, of himself, he was but an ordinary Filipino indian who,\r\nwhen left to himself to stand on his own merits, gave no signs of\r\nparticular judgement or power of thought. The Filipino on trial,\r\neven for some significant affair, cannot tell a lie to advantage:\r\nRizal was no exception even in this. The trial being ended he was\r\ncondemned to execution.\r\n\r\nPrevious to meeting his death he confessed and received the Holy\r\nCommunion from the hands of the Jesuit Fathers having after long\r\nconsideration, made the following retraction of his errors:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I declare myself Catholic and in this religion in which I was born\r\n    and educated I wish to live and die. I retract with all my heart\r\n    all my words, writings and actions that have been contrary to my\r\n    condition as a son of the Catholic Church. I believe and profess\r\n    whatever She teaches and I submit to whatever She demands. I\r\n    abominate masonry as an enemy of the Church and as a society\r\n    condemned by the Church.\r\n\r\n    \"The diocesan prelate, as superior ecclesiastical authority, may\r\n    make public this spontaneous manifestation, to make reparation\r\n    for the scandals which may have been caused by my works, and that\r\n    God and my fellow-men may pardon me.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Manila 29th December 1896.--Jose Rizal.--Witnesses: Juan del\r\n    Fresno, Chief of Picket.--Eloy Maure, Adjutant.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHe also entered the holy bonds of matrimony with the young woman\r\nwith whom he had been living for some time in Mindanao. On the way\r\nto the place of his execution he remarked to one of the Fathers who\r\naccompanied him. Father, it is my pride that has brought me here.\"\r\n\r\nOf the political error committed by the Spanish Authorities in\r\nthe execution of Rizal, I do not hold myself up as a judge. All\r\ngovernments, like human beings, commit mistakes and at times grave\r\nones. The Spanish authorities, feeling themselves justified in so\r\ndoing, ordered the execution of the prisoner who was responsible\r\nfor one of the most bloody revolts since the time of the French\r\nrevolution: the pattern taken by the Filipino leaders, for the means\r\nof the foundation of the Filipino republic. Rizal was executed on the\r\nLuneta. To assert that he was offered up as a victim to gratify the\r\nwishes of the Religious Orders is but a crude and vicious argument\r\nworthy of its inventors and propagators. Nothing, absolutely nothing,\r\ncan be brought forward to prove such an assertion, but on the contrary,\r\nthose members of the Religious Orders who concerned themselves in\r\nthe stirring affairs of the revolution were, as a very general rule,\r\nopposed to harsh and extreme measures being taken; and among these\r\nwas the Illustrious Archbishop of Manila, Sr. Nozaleda, a noble,\r\ntenderhearted and compassionate prelate, a prelate who has been dubbed\r\nby Foreman as \"the blood-thirsty Archbishop\". Had the friars held the\r\nreins of government as they are stated to have done, history would not\r\nhave to record the names of so many, many people who were executed:\r\npeople who were scarcely to be held as guilty, in as much as they\r\nwere but sheep who thoughtlessly followed their shepherds without\r\neven looking to see where the road they trod would lead them.\r\n\r\nIn politics Rizal had his party composed of a number of insignificant\r\npetty-lawyers, petty-doctors and others possessing academic titles and\r\na semi-formed cerebral power. These were backed by a mass of the people\r\nof Calamba, Rizal's birthplace. In their eyes he was a \"Messiah\", a\r\n\"Mahdi\", their prophet and redeemer. As an individual he was bright\r\nand intelligent, and had he not been led astray by those who made a\r\n\"cat's paw\" of him, and who cruelly deserted him in his hour of need,\r\nhe would doubtless have been one of the foremost Filipinos of to-day\r\nin that sphere of life in which God had placed him.\r\n\r\nA Spanish proverb says: \"In blind man's land the one eyed man is a\r\nking.\" Rizal was a king.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 9. Marcelo Hilario del Pilar y Gatmaytan was a native of\r\nBulacan. He was, by profession, a lawyer, and had been enabled to\r\ncomplete his studies in that direction through the good offices of the\r\nAugustinian Fathers of Manila, who had given him the money necessary\r\nto matriculate and to pay the cost of his title of \"abogado.\" [23]\r\n\r\nPilar left Manila for the peninsula about the end of '88 for fear of\r\ndeportation: a punishment at that time staring him in the face. He\r\nwas one of the earliest workers on the \"La Solidaridad\", the official\r\norgan of Filipino freemasonry in all its sections. He later on became\r\nits director.\r\n\r\nPilar was another of the many malays whose ways were beyond human\r\ncomprehension. Spaniards who have lived a life-time among the indians\r\nand studied them carefully from all points of view agree that the\r\ndeeper one studies the native character the more incomprehensible it\r\nbecomes. That is, the study of the average filipino: Pilar was one of\r\nthe average. He was not gifted with the education enjoyed by Rizal,\r\nnor was he such a stupid visionary as Pedro Paterno; he possessed\r\ntouches of the character of both.\r\n\r\nLike so many of those Filipinos who fed at the hands of the Religious\r\nOrders, he eventually turned to bite the hand that fed him. As in the\r\ncase of the others who had done the like, he did so, not because he had\r\ncause to, but because he fell, as did they, under the evil influence\r\nof those who utilized them to work out their schemes of treachery.\r\n\r\nPilar was sent to Spain as a delegate of the Committee of\r\npropaganda. Owing to this position of chief of the delegation in\r\nMadrid, and by reason of his intimate friendship with Morayta,\r\nhe occupied a position from which neither Rizal nor even the whole\r\nof the progressive indians combined, could drive him. He held, for\r\nsome time, high office in the Gr. Or. Esp. as will be seen from the\r\nfollowing clipping taken from page 107 of the Annual of that Orient\r\nfor the year 1894-95.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        \"GRAN CONS. DE LA ORDEN\r\n                               1894-1895\r\n                    Muy Ven. Gran Maestre Presidente\r\n               Ven. H. Miguel Morayta y Sagrario, Gr. 33\r\n                  ...................................\r\n                        Ven. Gran Orador Adjunto\r\n              V. Marcelo H. del Pilar Gr. 33\" (h. Kupang)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was Pilar who conceived the plan of the Katipunan; and yet after\r\nall it was not his conception, for the scheme he formed was at the\r\nbest, a piece of patch work made up of the plans worked out in the\r\nvarious revolutions which had taken place in some part of the world.\r\n\r\nWhat Pilar's ambition was, it is hard to say; from his actions and\r\nwritings one is almost driven to the supposition that he had none\r\nin particular, but was led to the separatist labors he performed by\r\nforce of compromise.\r\n\r\nWhen the time was ripe for action Pilar determined to leave Madrid and\r\nmake his way to Japan. He commenced the journey arriving at Barcelona,\r\nfrom whence he was to make his way east. There, however, he was taken\r\nsuddenly ill, and died on the 4th of June 1896, in the Hospital of\r\nthat city.\r\n\r\nIn many things Pilar was superior to Rizal. Unlike that agitator, Pilar\r\nwas not a sneaking, skulking petty-politician; he was straight-forward\r\nand had the courage of his opinions. What Pilar would have done if\r\nplaced in the same circumstances as Rizal it is hard to say, but we\r\nmay be assured that he would not have acted the coward as did Rizal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 10. Antonio and Juan Luna were two of four brothers. The former\r\nwas a bacteriologist, the latter an artist who at one time, whilst\r\nhe followed the instruction, and remained under the guidance of\r\nhis master, showed no little talent. Antonio went to Spain in '88,\r\nand later on passed to Paris where he lived with his brother Juan\r\nwho supported him. There he devoted himself to the study which made\r\nhim famous; this he did in the laboratory of Dr. Roux. He became an\r\nassistant editor of the Solidaridad, the official organ of filipino\r\nfreemasonry, and wrote many vicious articles in its columns over the\r\npseudonym of Taga-Ilog. As a member of the freemason fraternity he\r\nwas known as Gay Lussac.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Manila he established, for a livelihood, a school\r\nof fencing, and like the vain, insensate \"magpie in borrowed plumes\"\r\nthat he was, he once sent his seconds to a Spanish officer, inviting\r\nhim to a duel!\r\n\r\nDuring the second half of the rebellion of '96, Aguinaldo offered\r\nAntonio the position of director of the War Department with the\r\ngrade of General of Brigade. This honor, however, he declined. The\r\nIndependencia speaking on this incident, says:--\r\n\r\n\"The military knowledge of Sr. Luna, acquired during his captivity\r\n(sic) in the prisons of the peninsula (Spain), is to be found condensed\r\nin two small works, one concerning the organization of the army, having\r\nas its base the idea of obligatory service in which he demonstrates\r\nthat Luzon might put on a war footing 250,000 to 400,000 men, and\r\nthe whole archipelago as many as from 800,000 to 900,000. The other\r\nwork is a practical course in field fortifications as adopted by the\r\nFrench and German armies.\" [24]\r\n\r\nJuan, from childhood, was of an artistic turn of mind and found among\r\nhis many protectors those who sent him to Spain to study art. In\r\nSpain he met with Sr. Alejo Vera, a noteworthy artist, under whom\r\nhe studied, receiving an exceptional education both in art and in\r\nmorals, Sr. Vera being a Christian gentleman. Later on he went to\r\nRome, and there formed part of the Spanish artistic colony. After some\r\ntwo or three years of study there he sent to Spain his first painting\r\n[25]. Being an artistic production of a Filipino indian it was received\r\nwith open hands and given a reception greater than it really deserved,\r\nas a result of the influence of Luna's friends. From Rome he went\r\nto Paris. It was in that city that he committed the fiendish double\r\nmurder which so startled and shocked his friends and acquaintances,\r\nhis victims being his wife and his mother-in-law, sister and mother\r\nof a prominent political aspirant of modern Manila. The result of\r\nthe trial was that the courts of Justice of Paris absolved him. He\r\nthen returned to Madrid, and soon after, to Manila.\r\n\r\nWhat Spain did for the Filipino brought forth fruit in only a few of\r\nthe people who fell under her beneficent christian influence. The Lunas\r\nwere among the few. They, like so many other ungrateful children,\r\nrepaid their benefactors by becoming leaders of the insensate and\r\ninexcusable revolt against them: a revolt, the first act of which was\r\nto be the brutal murder of all Spaniards irrespective of parentage or\r\nother claims of consideration. Both the brothers suffered arrest by\r\nthe Spanish authorities for rebellion and sedition, but in spite of\r\nthe degree to which they were complicated, they remained practically\r\nfree from punishment, and ever at the right hand of the imbecile\r\nGeneral Blanco, himself a freemason, and friend of the enemies of\r\nhis country. Eventually the two brothers left the ante-chamber of\r\nthe Governor to enter the security of the military prison.\r\n\r\nBoth brothers eventually retracted their errors only to fall into\r\nthem again as soon as the lying protests of repentance had fallen\r\nfrom their lips.\r\n\r\nJuan died in Hong-Kong; Antonio, after a career of militarism succumbed\r\nto the same unprincipled ambition which carried Andres Bonifacio to\r\nan untimely grave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 11. Doroteo Cortes was banished by Governor Despujol in the year\r\n1893, to the province of La Union where he founded in San Fernando,\r\nthe Capital, aided by Arturo Dancel, the lodge \"Rousseau\" and two\r\nothers in the pueblos of San Juan and Agoo. He was a lawyer and became\r\nthe president of the committee of Propaganda which was formed with\r\nthe idea of gathering pecuniary resources for covering the expense\r\nof the distribution of all classes of pamphlets and anti-Religious\r\nproclamations. He was at one time the president of the Superior Supreme\r\nCouncil of the Katipunan [26], and received the funds collected for\r\nthe payment of the expenses of the political commission sent to Japan\r\nto seek the aid and protection of that power. Cortes was a co-worker\r\nwith Andres Bonifacio and whilst the former devoted his efforts to the\r\nenlistment of people for the general rising throughout the country,\r\nthe latter continued his negotiations with Japan to the end of forcing\r\nsome international struggle between Spain and that Power [27]. By\r\norder of the Superior Council Cortes went to Japan to join Ramos and\r\naid in the purchase of arms. Shortly after his arrival he communicated\r\nby letter with Ambrosio Bautista informing him that he had seen and\r\nspoken on the subject with the Japanese ministers of State and of\r\nForeign Affairs [28], and that the said ministers \"demanded guarantees\"\r\nof the probable success of the undertaking before entering into the\r\nscheme. According to a statement of Isabelo de los Reyes, Cortes was\r\n\"the first person of means and position who came to the decision of\r\nattacking, in the Philippines, the Religious Corporations. He was the\r\nsoul of the manifestation of '88.\" (See appendix B.) At the time of\r\nthe American occupation of the Archipelago the Cortes family showed\r\nthemselves friendly to the new sovereignty and aided in many ways\r\nthe establishment of good feeling between the two peoples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 12. Pedro Serrano, symbolic name Panday-Pira, was a 24th degree\r\nmason. He was a school-master of the municipal school of Quiapo. After\r\nhaving done considerable work of propaganda in masonry he abjured\r\nit. He was the cause of the entry into the lodges of hundreds of indian\r\nand half-caste clerks, laborers, employees, petty merchants and others\r\nof all classes and employments. He was accused by his fellow masons of\r\nexploiting the society [29] and of treason, of frequenting the Palace\r\nof the Archbishop and the College of San Juan de Letran, and of many\r\nthings unbecoming a mason. In a document dated the 31st of March 1894,\r\ndispatched by the G. Cons. Reg. of Filipino masonry to the lodge\r\nModestia, Serrano was denounced, and all masons were urged to flee\r\nfrom him. In the said document, a translation of which will be found\r\nin Appendix C, is poured forth the complaint of the president of the\r\nGr. Cons. (h. Muza) of a leakage somewhere in the treasury in which\r\nwere stored up the secrets of the treasonable labors being carried\r\nout in the Filipino lodges. By way of specific charges the president\r\ndenounces Panday-Pira because he had the courage to give vent to his\r\nopinions concerning the doings of the Filipino lodges, to a foreign\r\nmason; because he was known to have, for some reason or other, visited\r\nthe Archbishop's palace and Dominican College; that he had demanded\r\nthe possession of certain documents, threatening the possessors if\r\nthey did not give them up, etc. etc. On this account he was denounced\r\nas a traitor and dubbed \"reptile\", the pot calling the kettle black.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 13. Morayta, the famous Don Miguel, the \"papa\" of the rebellious\r\nFilipinos! It is an almost world-wide belief that the number 13 is\r\nan unlucky number. If this be so, then Miguel Morayta well deserves\r\nhis name, for in it there are thirteen letters; the first letter of\r\neach word commences with the thirteenth letter of the alphabet and\r\nit happens also that this miserable individual falls to note 13. I\r\nwill therefore complete the coincidence by saying all I have to say\r\nof this person in thirteen lines.\r\n\r\nMorayta was at one time Gr. Master of the Gr. Or. de Espana, but was\r\nlater on expelled therefrom, according to a masonic publication. In\r\n1888 he founded the Gr. Or. Espanol, the mother of the Katipunan. In\r\n1890 he took over the proprietorship of La Solidaridad then published\r\nby Marcelo del Pilar for separatist ends. Morayta was the idol of\r\nthe Filipino students who sought education in the Peninsula. Using\r\nhim as a means towards an end they aimed at, they banquetted him and\r\nthus assiduously attacking his stomach they finally captured him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 14. Tagalog: The Tagalogs are a branch of the Malay family\r\nwhich, in former times, dominated from Madagascar to the ends of the\r\nPacific. They form part of what we might call the Malay-Chinee race,\r\ni. e. the cross between the female on the Malay side and the Chinee\r\non the side of the male. This cross has been taking place from time\r\nimmemorial, commencing long before the islands were discovered by\r\nthe Spanish explorers. The present Tagalog indian enjoys more of the\r\ncharacteristics of the Chinee than of the Malay on account of the\r\npotency of the Chinee blood over the Malay.\r\n\r\nGoing back to ancient times the probability is that the original\r\nMalay first became modified by its crossing with the inhabitants\r\nproper of the archipelago--the Negritos--marks of which mixture are\r\nstill discernible in many of the Tagalogs.\r\n\r\nA second modification came through the mixture between the\r\nMalay-Negrito and the Indonesian, traces of which are seen in\r\nthe light color of the skin in a portion, although small, of the\r\nTagalogs. Another modification, the most marked, originated from the\r\ncrossing of the Malay-Negrito-Indonesian with the Chinee, the Chinee\r\nbeing marked by the increase in stature, the elevation of the skull\r\nand other minor marks.\r\n\r\nDuring the last three centuries this hybrid Tagalog has undergone\r\nanother small and gradual change by reason of a limited crossing with\r\nSpanish blood. This latter mixture however is insignificant in extent\r\nbut always produces a superior type. As a people the Tagalogs number\r\nabout one and a half millions, and inhabit the regions around about\r\nManila. The traits of character of the four principal trunks from\r\nwhich the Tagalog of to-day is derived are, although still present in\r\na greater or lesser degree, considerably modified by climatological\r\nand historical circumstances.\r\n\r\nAt the coming of the Spaniards the Tagalogs, like the remaining native\r\npeoples of the archipelago, were met with in the depths of the savage\r\nages, and were to a certain extent, of cannibalistic tendencies.\r\n\r\nThe average Tagalog is not wanting in courage, a fact he has often\r\ndisplayed, but this courage is never seen to advantage except when the\r\nindian is under the leadership of a person of exceptional valor or a\r\nstrict disciplinarian. Like most peoples derived from the Malay stock,\r\nthe Tagalog indian is subject to strange fits of mental aberration,\r\nthe fits taking different forms, generally innocent ones, the worst\r\nbeing a homicide under the influence of a \"hot head\". At least that\r\nis what might have been said of him 8 or 10 years ago, previous to\r\nthe time in which he became fanaticised by freemasonry. He is not\r\neven yet apt to run amok as is usual among the Malays and this is\r\nundoubtedly due to the civilizing religious influence which has been\r\nbrought to bear upon him during the three centuries of Spanish rule\r\nin the Archipelago. It is a noteworthy fact that in the same degree\r\nas the influence of religion, of the Religious Orders if you will,\r\nbecame lesser, in exactly equal degree did crime increase. Explain\r\nthis as you will the fact remains that during the four years or\r\nso that the indian has been under the care and protection of a\r\ngovernment indifferent to all religion, crime has increased a hundred\r\nfold, perhaps arithmetically so also, and crimes unheard of in days\r\ngone by, have become so common as scarcely to merit mention in the\r\ncolumns of Manila's yellow journalism. What the Tagalog indian is\r\nequal to when free from the restraint of the Catholic religion,\r\nhas been seen from the fearful crimes and barbarities committed\r\nagainst Spaniards and against Americans during the insurrection. The\r\nbrutalities committed upon the unfortunate prisoners who fell into\r\ntheir hands were unheard of even among the savage Arab hordes of the\r\nSoudan, nor have the records of the ferocity of the Chinese boxers\r\nyet told us of things equal to the fearful events which took place in\r\nthe province of Cavite and elsewhere. And for all this the Tagalog\r\nindian is responsible: the Tagalog for whom Pedro Paterno claims a\r\npre-Spanish civilization on the plan of the Aztec and ancient Peruvian\r\nindians. Like all oriental peoples the Tagalog is superstitious and\r\nloves demonstration, symbolism and things grotesque. About the only\r\nthing left to him of his ancient civilization as Paterno calls it,\r\nbarbarism we generally say, is his mythology. In it everything is\r\nmore or less connected with spirits. Their faith in what they call\r\ntheir anting anting [30] is unbreakable. Rizal was supposed to be\r\nunder the protection of the anting-anting but the leaden missiles\r\nwhich took away his life carried away the anting-anting also: and yet\r\nthere are thousands upon thousands of indians, some of them men of\r\nenlightenment, who still cling to the belief that Rizal still lives,\r\nthanks to the influence of his protecting amulet. Nor did anting anting\r\navail Aguinaldo who now probably believes far more in the protection of\r\nhis American prison than in that offered by his anting anting charms.\r\n\r\nTheir mythology has, like their ancient character, been greatly\r\nmodified in the vast majority, by the influence of the civilization\r\nimplanted by Spain. This is one point in which Spain has differed from\r\nmost nations in methods of civilization and colonization. However\r\nwe may judge her in respect to her colonial administration in the\r\nPhilippines, we cannot deny that she has been distinguished from other\r\nnations by her aim of preserving the native races of the archipelago,\r\nthe destruction consequent upon the radical change undergone in\r\neverything, being limited to the savage customs and immoralities in\r\nwhich the native peoples were found submerged.\r\n\r\nThe masonic lodges spoken of in the text which were asked of Morayta,\r\nwere established, although they were not exclusively Tagalog in\r\ntheir membership. As a result of the petition of the Filipino colony\r\nmentioned in the same text, the theories and practices of Masonry\r\nwere carried to the Tagalogs but instead of the needy brethren being\r\naided by the wealthy ones, they were subjected to a contribution\r\nin exchange for which they received a gaudy regalia; in other words\r\nthey were bought over with strings of beads and with tinsel truck as\r\nwere the indians discovered by Capt. Cook in the South Sea Islands,\r\nwith the exception that Capt. Cook and those who followed him carried\r\ncivilization to the natives, whilst the founders of the Katipunan\r\ncarried to the Tagalogs and the other indians of the archipelago\r\nmisery and demoralization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 15. Faustino Villaruel Gomara was a Spanish half-caste, a native\r\nof Pandaran, living in Binondo. He was the founder of the lodge \"La\r\nPatria\" of which he was also the Ven. Gr. Master with grade 18. He\r\nalso founded a lodge of female freemasons, for the foundation of\r\nwhich he committed the nefarious crime of prostituting his daughter,\r\nhanding her over, in the period of her innocence and candor, to the\r\nridiculous workings and practices of freemasonry. Rosario Villaruel\r\n(Minerva), thus sacrificed by her father, was initiated in Hong-Kong\r\nand made venerable of the first lodge of female masons in Manila,\r\ndrawing in after her a large number of her half-caste friends, young\r\nfolk of bare instruction. This lodge was known as \"La Semilla\". Its\r\ncomposition was: Sisters: Carlota Zamora, of Calle Crespo; Maria\r\nTeresa Bordas, of Tabaco, province of Albay; Fabiana Robledo,\r\nwife of Sixto Celis; Lorenza Nepomuceno, of Calle San Jose, Trozo;\r\nAngelica Lopez, Calle Jolo; Narcisa Rizal; Maria Dizon, Calle Trozo,\r\nand other fanatic females.\r\n\r\nVillaruel was the Gr. Oriente of filipino masonry, a deluded fanatic,\r\na man of but scarce intellectual endowments, an instrument of those\r\nwho knew more and were shrewder than he. By laying hands upon him\r\nthe Spanish Authorities laid hands also upon a large number of\r\nincriminating documents which were the means of connecting many\r\nprominent business men of Manila with the bloody programme of the\r\nKatipunan. Among these was Francisco L. Roxas.\r\n\r\nBesides these documents were a large number of loose papers written\r\nin Tagalog, in which were discovered many threatening phrases and the\r\nexpression of hopes in the success of an event to take place in the\r\nnear future. Masks and other masonic implements, including a heavily\r\nmade and sharply pointed dagger were also discovered.\r\n\r\nPrevious to suffering the penalty of his treason he made and signed\r\na public abjuration, for the copy of which see Appendix E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 16. Andres Bonifacio was the soul of the Katipunan movement;\r\nhe was the President of the \"Council of Ministers of the Supreme\r\nPopular Council.\" His social condition was of a low grade, that grade\r\nfrom which many of the most fanatical pseudo-reformers have come;\r\nhe was a warehouseman, a porter. In this capacity he was employed\r\nin the establishment of Messrs Fressel and Co., and was one of the\r\nhumblest of the employees.\r\n\r\nBonifacio was, however, very vain and quixotic. He was, too, a man\r\nof sanguinary character, and held the people over whom he attained\r\nascendancy, in awe. His ambition was the cause of his ignominious\r\ndownfall and brutal murder at the hands of another self-asserted\r\ndictator of the filipino Commune. Like most of his kind, he was\r\na great reader, and by those who knew him best he was likened to\r\nDon Quixote, for like that worthy he passed many a night burning\r\naway oil and candles, and sacrificing needed sleep in reading,\r\nuntil his brain was turned and his whole mind given up to ideas of\r\nrevolutions. His favorite study was the French Revolution, from the\r\nwhich he learned many lessons which he utilized in his projects, the\r\nprincipal of which was the formation of a government after the style\r\nof the French Commune. He was astute and comparatively intelligent,\r\nand spoke the Tagalog dialect well. For the carrying out of his plans\r\nhe had agents in every nook and corner. No place where information\r\nmight be gathered or the work of propaganda done, was over-looked. The\r\noffices of the Civil Government had their quota of his spies, as also\r\ndid the Intendencia, the Maestraza de Artilleria and the other large\r\ncenters. Nor were the Convents and Colleges overlooked, nor even the\r\nbig business Corporations.\r\n\r\nBonifacio enjoyed an envied ascendancy over the lower classes and\r\nthe ignorant. Like others of similar tendencies, Bonifacio knew how\r\nto exploit the \"membership\". He was at one time treasurer of the\r\nKatipunan, and upon one occasion after the examination of the books\r\nby the president of the society Andres was denounced as an exploiter,\r\nthe accounts being found in a very bad condition. A series of mutual\r\nsquabbles and insults passed between the president Roman Basa, and\r\nBonifacio, the whole affair ending up in a re-election of officers,\r\nBonifacio being chosen as president. This occurred towards the end\r\nof the year 1893.\r\n\r\nThe vanity of Bonifacio was comparable only to that of Aguinaldo. Among\r\nthe number of chief workers of the Katipunan was a certain Valenzuela,\r\na doctor who had, according to his own confession, been forced into\r\nthe membership by Bonifacio, on the strength of a \"love\" affair; he\r\nwas given the choice of membership or death. He chose the former but\r\nlater on resigned. Whilst a member he enjoyed a salary of 30 pesos a\r\nmonth as medical officer, but only with difficulty could he collect\r\nhis pay. He claimed to have been exploited by Bonifacio who, whilst\r\nmerely a porter, could thus have at his command the free services of\r\na real doctor, spurning the services of the petty physicians which\r\nabound in Manila. Nor was this all. His own (Bonifacio's) house\r\nhaving been burned down, he went, on the strength of this same \"love\"\r\naffair, to live in the house of the said doctor (see foot-note p. 48),\r\ntaking with him his paramour, the doctor paying the greater part of\r\nthe expenses thus incurred.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the organization of the popular Supreme Councils,\r\nBonifacio was chosen president of the Council of Trozo; but in\r\nconsequence of internal troubles occasioned by his rebelliousness,\r\nthe Supreme Council decided to dissolve the local Council. Bonifacio,\r\ntrue to his colors, disregarded this order and continued working on his\r\nown account, taking upon himself the faculties of the Supreme Council.\r\n\r\nHe preserved in a case which was found in the warehouse of Messrs\r\nFressel and Co., the organization of the \"Filipino Republic\" which\r\nwas to be, as well as a number of regulations, codes, decrees of\r\nnominations, etc., all drawn up in Tagalog (see foot-note p. 49.)\r\n\r\nUpon the discovery, on the 19th of August 1896, by the Augustinian\r\nPadre fray Mariano Gil, parish priest of Tondo, of the plot of the\r\nKatipuneros, Bonifacio and his immediate assistants fled from Manila to\r\nCaloocan. From that point he sent orders to the provinces of Manila,\r\nCavite and Nueva Ecija that a general rising should take place on the\r\n30th of that month. These orders were given out of revenge for the\r\nfailure of the blood-thirsty plot whereby every Spaniard, man, woman\r\nor child should share in the sufferings which his diseased brain had\r\nconcocted for those who should fall into his hands. Bonifacio issued\r\nspecial orders concerning the Governor General, his plan being that he\r\nand the other Spanish authorities of any importance should be taken\r\nprisoners, but not killed, it being intended to hold their persons\r\nas security for the granting of their demands. He called together\r\nthe members of the Junta Superior and nominated a general-in-chief,\r\na general of division and other officials. These however refused to\r\nstep into the places he had prepared for them and Bonifacio angered\r\nthereat threatened to have the head removed from the shoulders of\r\nanyone who dared to disobey him. The general-in-chief Teodoro Plata,\r\na cousin of Bonifacio, fled during the night following his nomination,\r\nwhereupon Bonifacio issued orders for his capture, commanding his\r\ndeath wherever he should be found.\r\n\r\nSometime previous to this, about the month of May, Bonifacio sent\r\nPio Valenzuela to Dapitan to hold a conference with Rizal concerning\r\nthe convenience of immediate rebellion against Spain. Rizal would not\r\nconsent to the projected revolt but opposed the idea most strenuously,\r\nbeing thrown into such a bad humor by the information he received\r\nof Bonifacio, that Valenzuela, who had gone to Dapitan intending to\r\nspend a month there, determined to return on the following day. On\r\nhis return to Manila he recounted to Bonifacio the result of his\r\nmission. Bonifacio who knew Rizal's influence over the people to\r\nbe greater than his own, had been living in hopes of receiving\r\nRizal's consent which would be the surrendering to him of the whole\r\nresponsibility and glory of the bloody enterprise. Bonifacio aspired to\r\nthe absolute, like all the so-called leaders of the revolt; so when he\r\nrealized the stand taken by Rizal, who was willing to wait patiently\r\ntill the poison with which he had inoculated the people should work\r\nof itself, he flew into a rage like a spoilt child, declaring Rizal\r\nto be a coward and imposing upon Valenzuela, his messenger, implicit\r\nsilence on this subject, prohibiting him from manifesting to anyone\r\nwhat he considered to be the bad exit of the consultation.\r\n\r\nNo methods were too underhand for Bonifacio; to gain his end he lied to\r\nthe people over whom he held sway as only a Filipino can lie. On one\r\noccasion he affirmed that in Coregidor was a vessel loaded with arms\r\nand ammunition for the rebels, and by this means he animated them,\r\na very necessary thing at that time, as they were but scantily armed\r\nwith bolos and were no match against those they intended to assail.\r\n\r\nTaking him all in all, Bonifacio was a first class organizer for\r\nsuch an enterprise as that aimed at by the Katipunan, and upon his\r\nshoulders lies the weight of the greater part of the iniquities of\r\nthe diabolical society. He ordered the outbreak and in a skillful\r\nmanner pulled the strings which worked the figures which formed the\r\nperformers in the marionette revolution. He had rivals in the field\r\nhowever, the most powerful being Aguinaldo, the would be president\r\nof the mushroom republic. After the encounter at San Juan del Monte\r\nin which the insurgents suffered the loss of 95 killed and 42 taken\r\nprisoners in the first instance, and shortly afterwards of 200 more,\r\nBonifacio escaped, carrying with him the funds of the Katipunan,\r\nsome 20,000 pfs. [31] He was supposed to be in hiding in the most\r\ninaccessible parts of the mountains of San Mateo, in as much as he had\r\ntold Pio Valenzuela that in case the movement were unsuccessful he had\r\ndetermined to retire to that point to devote himself to highway robbery\r\n[32], to foot-padding, an idea gotten from some modern French novel\r\nprobably. He worked his way eventually into Cavite, and, according to\r\ninformation gotten from Pedro Gonzalez, he fell into the disfavor of\r\nAguinaldo who saw his own superiority in danger of being supplanted;\r\nthe generalisimo therefore put a price upon his head [33]. A party was\r\nsent in search for the runaway and upon his capture he was subjected\r\nto most brutal treatment, and at last fell a victim to the unprincipled\r\nambition of the Dictator.\r\n\r\nHad Bonifacio lived he would have made a splendid acquisition to\r\nthe Partido Federal, he being a man who could, like many of the\r\nself-asserted leaders of to-day, plan and follow out any double-faced\r\npolicy that might be needed under the circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 17. This note not being ready at the time of the printing of the\r\npages of this section, it has been reserved for note 101, which see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 18. Domingo Franco y Tuason was a native of Mambusao, Province\r\nof Capiz. He was the president of the first junta called by Rizal in\r\n1892 for the formation of the \"Liga Filipina\". Till that time he was\r\nlike many others of the same class almost unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 19. The character of the native: this is a subject upon which\r\none might write many volumes without conveying to the minds of his\r\nreaders more than a faint idea of what that strange character is.\r\n\r\nMore mysterious than the most profound mystery of Religion,\r\nhis most striking trait of character being a decided tendency to\r\nretrogression, the Malay stands out among the numerous divisions of\r\nthe human family as a man with a marked propensity to the mysterious,\r\nto the prodigious. He is accustomed to give a blind obedience to\r\nhis superiors and more so to his own caciques, he is docile as a\r\ngeneral rule, and shows but little resentment to abusive language,\r\nalthough he will sometimes carefully guard the remembrance of some\r\ninsignificant insult or blow, and take a cruel revenge, a thousand\r\ntimes greater than the injury he received, after a period, at times,\r\nof years. Other peculiarities of the native are his delight in gambling\r\nand cockfighting, his aversion to manual labor, his infantile but\r\nexcessive vanity, his lack of the power of thought in matters of\r\nmoment, his well developed imagination, his instability from all points\r\nof view and his liability to complete and radical changes. The average\r\nindian is to-day virtuous, honest and grateful for favors received,\r\ntomorrow he is vicious, thieving and shows an ingratitude not to be\r\nfound even in the brute creation. This very marked trait of character\r\nmay be found in many of the Filipinos who have held and still hold\r\nsome of the highest official positions in the islands.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the Filipino indian in a few words: he is inexplicable. There\r\nhave been those who have spent their lives in the study of the indian,\r\nbut in spite of all that man can do to study man, the problem remains\r\nunsolved. Only those \"globe trotters\" who have studied the native\r\nfrom the muchacho who waited upon them at the hotel at which they\r\nstayed during their few days visit, and the cochero who had the honor\r\nof conducting such savants to and from the Luneta, have so far been\r\nable to demonstrate what is this character which has puzzled men of\r\ncommon sense and lifelong experience, for centuries.\r\n\r\nBeing by nature credulous, ignorant and superstitious, the indian fell\r\nan easy victim to the mysteries of freemasonry, which served him as\r\nare introduction to the semi-savage methods of the \"Liga Filipina\"\r\nand the barbarous practices of the Katipunan, the pacto-de-sangre of\r\nwhich, carried him back to the savage times of his remote ancestors\r\nwho were drawn from their mountain and forest lairs and domesticated\r\nby the Religious Orders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes 20, 21, 22. The initiations, proofs, oaths etc., of Universal\r\nfreemasonry were utilized by the Filipino lodges to serve as a\r\nceremonial, a very essential thing to the success of any association\r\namong orientals. Nothing suited the taste of the Filipino better than\r\nthe awe inspiring solemnity of his initiation. These ceremonies however\r\nfell into abuse, and by the time they became utilized by the Katipunan\r\nthey had reached the verge of the grossest superstition and absurdity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 23. The G. Cons. Reg. was installed in 1893. A masonic document\r\nbearing a seal \"Gr. Consejo Regional de Filipinas. G. Secretaria\",\r\nand purporting to be a copy of two paragraphs from a letter of the\r\nillustrious bro. Kupang (Marcelo H. del Pilar) dated from Madrid on\r\nthe 17th December 1894, says: \"D. Miguel (Morayta) has a very poor\r\nopinion of the Reg. (Regional Council).... He says that this Council\r\ncontinues working well for some few months, at the end of which all\r\nthe enthusiasm of the founders vanishes and.... Oh, if we could only\r\nby our acts give the lie to this pessimism. Morayta was the founder\r\nof the Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 24. La Solidaridad was the official organ of Filipino freemasonry\r\nin all its branches. Although it was published in the peninsula\r\nits circulation was intended for the Philippines. Its editors were\r\nthe leaders of the disaffection against the metropolis and stout\r\nadvocates, indirectly, of an impossible independence. The chief\r\naim of the paper was to mortify everything Spanish, and to this\r\nend its columns were continually full of seditious articles aimed,\r\nnot merely at individuals but at the State. Its diatribes against\r\nthe Government of the Metropolis were of the bitterest nature, and\r\ntherefore but little publicity was given to the sheet in Madrid,\r\nwhere it was printed. It enjoyed no exchange with the periodicals of\r\nimportance of the city, had no street sales, nor was it exposed for\r\nsale publicly. The libraries did not carry it on their tables and it\r\nnever reached the hands of the public authorities. In fact the people\r\nof the official element know nothing of its existence.\r\n\r\nIn the office of this bi-monthly paper was established a freemason\r\nlodge bearing the same name as the paper; all the members of the\r\nAssociation Hispano-Filipina became members of the lodge. Being the\r\norgan of masonry as well as of separatism it was introduced into\r\nthe Archipelago and secured a free circulation in all parts of the\r\nprincipal islands where its calumnies against the Religious Orders\r\nhad the effect of producing a decided effect upon the maintenance of\r\npublic order.\r\n\r\nThe statement that the bi-monthly was founded by Pilar is erroneous;\r\nit was first published by Lopez Jaena in Barcelona where it enjoyed\r\nits enforced life till it reached its number 18, of October 1889,\r\nwhen it suddenly ceased publication on account of the seizure by the\r\nauthorities of a number of incriminating documents and pamphlets. It\r\nrecommenced publication in Madrid on the 15th of November of the\r\nsame year. It was later on acquired by Pilar and Morayta. It was in\r\nreality a vent for the spleen of its writers against Spain and things\r\nSpanish; it was a precursor of the Independencia [34] the official\r\norgan of the Revolution against the U. S., and of the La Democracia\r\nits daughter, the official organ of the Federal Party, the dregs of\r\nthe old revolutionary government of Malolos. [35]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 25. One of the first propagators of Filipino masonry was\r\nSr. Centeno, Civil Governor of Manila, a man of anything but happy\r\nmemory for this country [36]. Centeno and Quiroga Ballesteros worked\r\nhard to undermine the beneficial influence of the Clergy, an influence\r\nwhich was the safe-guard of law and order. Their most famous piece of\r\nwork was the manifestation of '88 against Archbishop Payo (See note\r\n2). In that manifestation was conceived the cry of sedition which\r\nwas later on to ring throughout the archipelago and tear down the\r\nbanner of the fatherland to replace it with the red flag of anarchy;\r\na flag which well nigh brought the people of a would be independent\r\ncountry to the verge of political and moral destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 26. No sooner had Almighty God consummated the grand work of\r\nthe creation, the culmination of which was the breathing into man\r\nof an immortal soul, than the devil, the father of evil, jealous of\r\nthe attributes given by God to man, made his bold attempt to destroy\r\nGod's immortal work. From that moment to this present the spirits\r\nof evil have carried on an unceasing warfare against what has been\r\nfor the glory of God. The Monastic Orders ever since the days of\r\ntheir birth have had to contend against these powers of evil; and\r\nthere is therefore little necessity for surprise that those who were\r\nemployed in such work as were the unscrupulous persons who came to the\r\narchipelago to sow ruin in the consciences of the people and scandal\r\nin society, should carry on a bitter campaign against the Religious\r\nOrders to whom was owing every jot and tittle of the civilization and\r\nculture enjoyed by the Filipinos. The Monastic Orders have ever been\r\nthe bulwark of Christianity, and as such have had to bear the brunt\r\nof the battle. Europe owes the solid foundation of its political,\r\nsocial and religious life to the Religious Orders, which, during\r\nthe ages in which the Huns, Goths and other barbarians overran and\r\ndevastated those lands, hoarded up in the nooks and corners of their\r\nmonastic dwellings the seed which, when afterwards sown, was to become\r\nthe stout tree of civilization which should spread its sheltering\r\nbranches to the four corners of the earth. One of these branches\r\ndrawing its fullness of life and vigor directly from the trunk,\r\nextended to these far off islands and, casting its shade over the\r\nembruted mankind here existing at that time, wrought a change over\r\nit no less marked than that wrought over the European peoples. From\r\nthe day in which Father Urdaneta, that intrepid Augustinian, set\r\nfoot upon Philippine soil, till the day upon which the hydra-headed\r\nKatipunan appeared in the land, the Monastic Orders have been the\r\none great source of all that was really useful and beneficial to the\r\ninhabitants of the archipelago, although at times the moral interests\r\nof the people were not the commercial interests of the country.\r\n\r\nThe \"friar\" so much slandered by those who wish to overthrow his\r\nbeneficent influence, ever carried the banner of his country enlaced\r\nwith the Cross of the Redeemer. He came to the Archipelago as a\r\nmessenger of peace and order, and was the strongest supporter of the\r\nsovereignty of his nation. The \"friar\" was hated because he was the\r\none who best knew and understood the indian, and from his intimate\r\nknowledge of his parishioners, could the more easily detect anything\r\non their part which tended to the detriment of the integrity of the\r\nSpanish sovereignty.\r\n\r\nThe campaign against the Religious Orders was the attack of the\r\nbattering-rams against the city to be captured. By piercing the\r\nwall the entry into the city could be the easier made; and this the\r\nseparatist element well knew, hence all their efforts were directed\r\nagainst the stout wall which defended from its assaults the treasure\r\nof the metropolis.\r\n\r\nFor three hundred years the Philippines remained submitted to Spain\r\nexclusively by reason of the moral influence of the Clergy. Whilst\r\nthe banner of Spain, floated over the Archipelago, the Religious\r\nformed the strongest guard for its protection; when it fell, strung\r\nby the ingratitude and treachery of those who had sworn to defend\r\nit to the last drop of their blood, and lay dishonored in the dust,\r\nit was the Religious who bowed his head in the deepest grief and who\r\nshed the bitterest tears. When the flag of the conquerer was hauled up\r\nto the height from which once gloriously floated the symbol of Spanish\r\nauthority, the Religious, obedient to the commands of his superiors,\r\nwithdrew to the solicitude of his convent, to await in patience,\r\nthe passing of the storm. He looks out upon the clouded political\r\nhorizon, as Noah looked out from the window of the ark upon the vast\r\nsea of waters which hid from his view the fearful destruction which\r\nhad overcome the world, patiently awaiting the time when he should,\r\nat God's will, go forth to commence again the work of reconstruction.\r\n\r\nOften have I heard the opinion expressed that the Government's worst\r\nenemy is the \"friar\", that it is the \"friar\" who keeps alive the\r\nspirit of rebellion. Let those who think thus, ponder over one small\r\nthought: what has the friar to gain in sustaining a rebellion which\r\nhas caused him more moral and material damage, than has been caused\r\nto any other entity in the Philippines? To those who are able and\r\nwilling to utilize the power of thought with which God has endowed\r\nthem, it is sufficiently clear that the Religious has nothing to gain\r\nby such tactics, but, on the contrary, all to lose.\r\n\r\nIn Spanish times the native enemies of the Religious Orders were the\r\nenemies of Spain and in these days, the enemy of the friar is by no\r\nmeans a real friend, whatever he may claim to be, of the Government of\r\nof the U. S. The Spanish masons and the Filipino separatists found the\r\nfriar to be the greatest obstacle to be encountered. \"The friar,\" wrote\r\nGovernor D. Francisco Borrero, to Sr. Canovas, in a memoir concerning\r\nthe Archipelago, \"knowing the language, spirit, and tendencies of the\r\nnatives, is considered as the principal obstacle for the realization\r\nof the filibuster idea, and hence arises their aspiration (that of\r\nthe enemies of Spain) that the Religious Orders should be eliminated,\r\nbecause such a step being taken, they believe they will have travelled\r\nhalf the journey....\"\r\n\r\nThe propaganda of Universal freemasonry, of Filipino freemasonry,\r\nof the Liga Filipina, of the Compromisarios, was aimed principally at\r\nthe Religious Orders, but the results attained were but introductory\r\nto the real work of the Katipunan, which, finding itself cornered by\r\nthe discovery of the plot it had concocted against the Government,\r\nshowed its hand. Its aim was anti-Spanish and not merely anti-friar,\r\nas is sufficiently clear from the fact that in all the documents of\r\nthe diabolical association it is death to all the Spaniards, and not\r\nto this or that class. Moreover in many cases the same Katipuneros\r\nsaved their parish priests from a sure death whilst they dealt out\r\nanything but kind treatment to those of the Civil Guard (Filipinos)\r\nand the Spanish troops who fell into their hands. The friars who were\r\nmurdered by the rebels were not murdered for being friars but because\r\nthey were Spaniards. The documents captured, the result of the trials\r\nheld in judgement of persons guilty of treason, show clearly that the\r\nrevolution was for the purpose of gaining the independence of the\r\ncountry from Spain, and not merely to bring about the expulsion of\r\nthe Religious Orders. Aguinaldo, the leader of the Katipunan hordes,\r\ndesired to send the friars who fell prisoners into his hands, over\r\nto Hong-Kong, where they would be at liberty to return to their own\r\ncountry; but this merciful desire of his was overruled by his advisers,\r\namong whom were numbered Mabini his right hand man, Pardo de Tavera,\r\nLegarda and Buencamino, all three of them traitors to the cause of\r\nindependence. To-day they stand in positions of honor, honor which\r\nthey have done nothing to deserve, whilst Aguinaldo who was the tool\r\nof political schemers, their play-thing, is cast into disgrace and\r\nkept in the background, a scape-goat for the sins and shortcomings\r\nof men whose names disgrace the darkest pages of Philippine history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 27. Vast numbers of these documents were later on destroyed in\r\nthe hope that certain affairs of an anti-patriotic nature might be\r\nhushed up, and many persons of a high official standing saved from\r\nscandal. Padre Mariano Gil, O. S. A., who made known to the public\r\nauthorities the fearful plot of the Katipunan in time to prevent the\r\nbrutal murder of hundreds of Spaniards, was granted certified copies\r\nof a large number (all the principal ones) of the documents and these\r\nhave been since preserved with the greatest care, and remain to-day\r\nas a standing proof of the duplicity of many persons who live in\r\nignorance of the fact of the existence of the said certified copies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 28. The element here spoken of was the Filipino colony (all of\r\nthem separatists) and Morayta the \"papa\" of the said Filipinos of\r\nseparatist tendencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 29. This committee, although not exclusively masonic, was\r\nessentially revolutionary, and had for its duty the distribution of\r\nworks of propaganda. Its delegate in Europe was Marcelo H. del Pilar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 30. See note 26. The campaign at this present carried on by some\r\nof the filipino and Spanish papers, and, in contradiction to the\r\nfundamental principles of Americanism, by the local American press\r\nalso, is but a sequel to the work of this committee of propaganda. The\r\ncalumnies which are literally crammed into the columns of Manila's\r\nEnglish speaking daily and weekly press are but a poor reproduction of\r\nthe vicious publications distributed throughout the archipelago since\r\nthe year 1888. For fourteen years have these calumnies been published,\r\nbut in spite of countless challenges, never have the statements\r\nbrought forward been backed up with even the shadow of proof. When\r\nalmighty God completed his creation by the making of man and woman,\r\nhe led them to Eden, placing them under his law. Then it was that the\r\ndevil beguiled them with lying words: \"For God doth know that in that\r\nday that you shall eat thereof (of the forbidden fruit) your eyes shall\r\nbe opened, and you shall be as Gods knowing good and evil.\" From that\r\nday to this, this same argument that the devil used to try to prove\r\nthat God was withholding from the people what was to their benefit,\r\nis being to-day used by certain of the offspring of that evil spirit\r\nagainst the element of good, against the Religious Orders, the servants\r\nof God, claiming that they held from the people of this Archipelago\r\nthat which was for their good and advancement. Adam and Eve found\r\nto their bitter cost that the devil lied: those who are to-day being\r\nmisled by anti-friar calumny will make the same discovery in due time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 31. This statement is erroneous. The opinion of the author was\r\nformed from statements made by those charged with treason. Many of\r\nthose under this charge gave false testimony, as was later on proved,\r\nand in that testimony implicated honorable Filipinos who had never\r\nharbored such ideas in their hearts as those they were accused of. Many\r\nof the wealthy element of Luzon and other islands of the group, were\r\nforced by threats and compromises into position they had no desire to\r\noccupy. Of these the great majority were either insular Spaniards, that\r\nis sons of Spanish parents, but born in the Philippines, or they were\r\nSpanish mestizos or indians. Some 90% of the wealthy revolutionists\r\nwere Chinese half-castes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 32. And at what a cost! Think of the thousands of hard earned\r\ndollars which went to swell the funds gathered to feed and clothe and\r\nto satisfy the fads and fancies of those exploiters. And what has\r\nthe poor indian who provided the money gained in the deal? Four or\r\nfive years of bloodshed and disaster he has surely gained; but what\r\nis of more importance to him is that he barely escaped falling into\r\nthe hands of his own countrymen! He fell out of the frying-pan and\r\nalmost fell into the fire!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 33. The aspirations of the association were, to say the least,\r\nanti-patriotic; they were always underhand; they were the aspirations\r\nof the \"Liga\", of the \"Compromisarios\" and of the Katipunan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 34. \"In the following year, Pedro Serrano arrived from Spain and\r\nthen was masonry introduced into the Philippines, the first lodge\r\ninstituted being the \"Nilad\" [37] its first Venerable being Jose\r\nRamos.\" Testimony of Moises Salvador y Francisco (fol. 1,138 to 1,143).\r\n\r\nAccording to the testimony of Antonio Salazar (fol. 1,118 to 1,129)\r\n\"In 1892 Pedro Serrano came from Spain and in union with Jose Ramos\r\njoined a lodge of peninsular Spaniards, and commenced the propaganda\r\nof masonry exclusively among Filipinos, in a short time establishing\r\nthe mother lodge known as the Nilad ... the number of members becoming\r\nexcessive, other lodges were established in the suburbs....\"\r\n\r\nInto this lodge Nilad or the lodges formed therefrom, passed all the\r\nmembers of the committee of propaganda and of the local delegations,\r\nthe work of the propaganda of masonry and that of separatism being\r\ncarried on in the same lodge room. The plea that masonry had no\r\nconnection with the Katipunan fails to stand good in face of this\r\ntestimony, added to which may be mentioned letters of M. del Pilar\r\nto La Modestia concerning the organization and labors of separatism;\r\nas well as other letters, rich in masonic jargon, to the lodges and\r\nto individuals connected with the double work of propagating masonry\r\nand spreading among the people ideas of the basest of ingratitude.\r\n\r\nTo the lodge Nilad, the Gr. Sec. of the Gr. Or. Esp. wrote from Madrid,\r\nJune 8th 1892:\r\n\r\n\r\n                         AL. G. D. G. A. D. U.\r\n                    Liberty.--Equality.--Fraternity.\r\n                 Universal Freemasonry. Spanish Family.\r\n\r\n    The Resp. Log. Nilad, No. 144 of A. L. and A. masons of the\r\n    Philippines regularly constituted in the Federation of the\r\n    Gr. Or. Espanol (seat in Madrid).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letter goes on to speak of the new foundation and the number\r\nof initiations.\r\n\r\n\"It pleases us much,\" says the Gr. Sec. \"to see the activity and zeal\r\nwhich you employ in the labors, and for it we greet you. Nevertheless,\r\nwe must remind you always of the greatest care in the election of the\r\nlaborers. Not all men, although they profess our ideas and doctrines,\r\nserve for good masons,...\"\r\n\r\nMorayta, writing on the 12th of June 1892 to bro. Panday Pira, says:\r\n\"... But do not forget an advice which I believe Ruiz gave you also:\r\nbe very careful; do not open your arms to any except they be of full\r\nconfidence.... Remember that, even though things have changed there (in\r\nthe Philippines) you run all the danger consequent upon the domination\r\n(sic) of the friar and of the General.\" The general was Despujols,\r\nan upright, honest and sincere man who was too apt to measure other\r\npeople's corn by his own bushel. The filibusters took advantage of\r\nthe fact, and by their lying protests of love for Spain, captivated\r\nhim and fooled him out and out for a time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 35. At that time liberty of association was not allowed by law in\r\nthe Archipelago. To attain their ends this was the thing most necessary\r\nfor the separatists. Without the shelter of the law of association\r\nnothing could be done except by stealth. It was for want of this\r\nprivilege that the shelter of the masonic lodge room was sought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 36. Blumentritt, Fernando; of German race, Austrian by\r\nnationality, resident in Bohemia and therefore spoken of by\r\nvarious writers sometimes as a German, at others as a Bohemian or\r\nan Austrian. Like Foreman [38], Blumentritt claimed to be a fervent\r\nCatholic and yet was an open enemy of the Church. He claimed moreover\r\nto be a great friend of Spain and yet openly sided with her enemies. He\r\nwas one of the collaborators of the La Solidaridad.\r\n\r\nIsabelo de los Reyes writes of him: \"The savant (sic) Blumentritt the\r\nbrother of the Filipinos, has always served us with disinterest (except\r\nin what concerned his pocket) and opportuneness. He was the first who\r\ndid us justice by publishing many valuable articles to demonstrate,\r\nunder all points of view, the superiority of the Filipino (Isabelo\r\ndoes not say over what) and defending our cause against the ambition\r\nof the imperialists (that is the Spaniards).\"\r\n\r\nBlumentritt was a member of the society known as the \"Amigos del Pais\"\r\n[39], and remained so till his actions and writings caused well\r\nthinking Spaniards and Philippinos [40] to call for his dismissal\r\nfrom its membership. The patriotic outcry against him caused him to\r\nresign on the 14th of November 1889; the Solidaridad of the 31st of\r\nDecember of the same year published his resignation. The press of\r\nManila was exceptionally bitter against him and only such Filipinos\r\nas those who continue up to the present time forming part of the\r\njuntas in Hong-Kong, Madrid, Paris, London and other places looked\r\nup to him for the assistance they could not find at home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 37. It was naturally in the Peninsula where the chief work of\r\nthe propaganda had to be carried on, and it was there also that the\r\npropaganda had the least effect. The principal instrument for the\r\ndissemination of the seed of separatist aspirations was the Solidaridad\r\n(See note 24). The Filipinos here, who gave their subscriptions and\r\nother sums of money for the support of the bi-monthly, were kept\r\nunder the impression that the official organ was making a great\r\nnoise in Madrid; but as it never reached the official world it was\r\nsupposed to influence, its publication was practically useless. In\r\nthe Philippines it served the same purpose as the La Independencia:\r\nthat is, it served to keep alive the spirit of unrest, and by the\r\nlies it published, made the people believe that their leaders were\r\ngoing to lead them to a promised land which \"flowed with milk and\r\nhoney.\" They eventually got into the promised land, only to find that\r\nthe milk was very much \"condensed\", and that the honey was only to be\r\ngot after those who secured it had been exposed to the very unpleasant\r\noperation of being stung by the bees which produced it.\r\n\r\nInstead of serving to keep together the subjects and their rulers\r\nin a bond of peace and tranquility, and helping them to come to a\r\nmutual understanding, in which state the progress and advancement\r\nof the islands and their inhabitants could be the easier and the\r\nbetter accomplished, the separatist element, by their propaganda,\r\ncaused more and more strife by attacking national institutions\r\nand by casting slurs upon national honor. The discontent stirred\r\nup against the Spanish authorities was identical to that which,\r\nuntil the passing of the law of sedition and even since that time,\r\nwas stirred up against the American sovereignty. In its propaganda\r\nagainst the Religious Orders, inciting the native clergy against the\r\nlawful authority of their Bishops, it was the precursor of modern\r\nManila's American press. History tells us what was the result of the\r\nlessening of the moral influence of the Religious Orders in the days\r\nof Spanish rule, and to-day History repeats itself. The inciting of\r\nthe native clergy against their Bishops is encouraging the natives,\r\nas a whole, to resist lawful authority. The cry to-day is \"down with\r\nthe friar,\" tomorrow it will be \"down with the American.\" In 1888 it\r\nwas down with the Religious Orders, in 1896 it had become \"death to\r\nall Spaniards\". In 1898 the American was blessed as a deliverer from\r\noppression, in 1899 cursed as an intruder. To-day...? Who knows the\r\nopinion of the people? Who but a few ignorantes trust the great men\r\nof the late revolution?\r\n\r\nIn Spain the work of the separatists produced no effect upon the\r\npeople; a few here and there of the least patriotic of the scum of\r\nBarcelona and Madrid aided them but apart from these and the Bible\r\nSocieties, no one interested themselves in their cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 39. From the earliest to the latest days of the period of the\r\nrevolt, that is from '88 to '98, this was one of the greatest obstacles\r\nto be overcome. Money was collected for propaganda in Spain and in\r\nJapan; what became of it all? Money was collected for the purpose\r\nof releasing or stealing away Rizal; what became of it? Funds were\r\ncollected for the purchase of rifles and ammunition for the Katipunan,\r\nand, at the last moment, Andres Bonifacio fled with some 20,000\r\npesos. This continual squabble over the administration of the funds\r\nis a proof clear enough, of the existence of organized exploiters\r\nwhose pockets were of more concern to them than were the interests\r\nof their country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 40. It is almost needless to say that this latter was in the\r\nminority; later on Pilar suffered a marked change of temperament\r\nand became more decidedly separatist than Rizal. Rizal was willing\r\nto give the goose a chance to lay her golden eggs; Pilar becoming\r\nimpatient killed the goose with the scheme of the Katipunan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 41. \"Previous to his return to Manila Rizal lived some time in\r\nHong-Kong. From there he forwarded to Moises Salvador Francisco the\r\nstatutes and instructions for the \"Liga Filipina\".\"--Testimony of\r\nthe said Francisco. (fols. 1,138-1,143.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 42. \"It resulting that after some years of voluntary expatriation\r\n... a Spanish citizen (Rizal) born in the Philippines, directed a\r\nfirst letter, dated some months back in Hong-Kong, to the superior\r\nAuthorities, offering his aid and assistance for the better government\r\nand progress of the Philippines, at the same time in which his latest\r\nbook commenced circulation, for which reason no reply was given; and in\r\na second letter dated in the month of May, in which, recognizing the\r\npolicy of generous attraction, of morality and justice here implanted\r\n... announced his intention of returning to his native soil to dispose,\r\ntogether with his friends, of the property they possessed, and to\r\ngo with their families to found, in Borneo, a filipino agricultural\r\ncolony under English protection....\"\r\n\r\n\"A few days afterwards, the Spanish citizen ... disembarked with his\r\nsister in Manila....\" (See also note 8.) Extracts from the Decree of\r\nDeportation issued against Rizal by Governor Despujols, 7th July 1892.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 43. \"In the year 1892, Rizal being in Manila, recently arrived\r\nfrom Europe, several people of the country were gathered together,\r\namong them Andres Bonifacio, Numeriano Adriano, Timoteo Paez and\r\nEstanislao Legaspi, in a wooden house in calle Dulumbayan, were\r\na society known as the \"Liga Filipina\" was founded.\" Testimony of\r\nValentin Diaz, native of Panay, Ilocos Norte.\r\n\r\n\"In May or June 1892 Jose Rizal reached Manila; and encharged by\r\nhim, Paez and Serrano invited a large number of persons to gather\r\non a certain day ... in the house of Doroteo Ongjungco where Rizal\r\nmanifested to those present, among whom was the witness, that it was\r\nnecessary to form an association which should be called the \"Liga\r\nFilipina\", the object and of which should be the attainment of the\r\nseparation of these islands from Spain.\" Moises Salvador y Francisco\r\n(fols. 1,296-1,299).\r\n\r\n\"The reunion was called by Rizal, and the witness was invited\r\nby Timoteo Paez, who conducted him to the house of Doroteo\r\nOngjungco.... That Jose Rizal addressed those present, manifesting\r\nthe convenience of establishing an association under the name of the\r\n\"Liga Filipina\" with the object of collecting funds by different\r\nmeans, to the end of securing opportunely the independence of these\r\nislands\".... Testimony of Domingo Franco y Tuason (fols. 1299-1303).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 44. It was not the aim which Rizal had in his mind, of delivering\r\nhis country from disabilities but the manner in which he set to work to\r\naccomplish that end, to which objection must be raised. When a people\r\nsuffer under the oppression of its rulers, all the world admires the\r\nman who rises to throw off the hateful yoke. But when the oppression is\r\nimaginary and when the so-called hero is but a marionette in the hands\r\nof political schemers who seek their own advantage under the shelter\r\nof a pretence to throw off a yoke which does not exist, one cannot\r\nadmire the part played by the deluded \"tool\". The emancipation from\r\nthe mother-country was the key-note of the revolt. It was the aim of\r\nthe Filipino freemasons, of the Liga Filipina, of the Compromisarios\r\nand of the Katipunan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 45. Rizal was deported to Dapitan, in the island of Mindanao,\r\nby decree of Governor Despujols, part of which has been quoted in\r\nnote 42. The decree goes on to say that, by reason of the fact that\r\n\"the veil under which, up this present, he has succeeded in hiding his\r\ntrue intentions has been torn asunder,\" ... \"that he adduces no other\r\ndefence but useless denials, having recourse to throwing the blame\r\nof the discovery of the leaflets upon his own sister (see page 99)....\"\r\n\r\n\"In fulfillment of the high duties which devolve upon me as your\r\nGeneral and Vice Royal Patron ...

See note 102.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 49. \"The object of the society (the Liga) is the establishment\r\nof shops, workshops, businesses, industries and even a bank if\r\npossible, with the end in view of collecting funds for an armed\r\nrising.\"--Testimony of Juan Dizon Matanza, (fols. 1,132-1,138.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 50. The ceremonies practiced by the Liga differed but little from\r\nthose practiced by the Katipunan. The chief difference lay in the fact\r\nthat the ceremonial of the Katipunan partook more of the grotesque,\r\nof the absurd, of paganism.\r\n\r\nPio Valenzuela in recounting the forms and ceremonies practiced upon\r\nhis initiation, said:\r\n\r\n\"Once in the house [42], they spoke of many things, en resume,\r\nthat the aim of the association was to obtain the independence of\r\nthe Philippines, oppressed and enslaved by the Spaniards. Placing,\r\nlater on, a dagger at his breast, they obliged him to throw himself\r\nupon it, a thing which the witness could not pluck up courage enough\r\nto do; whereupon they placed it in his hand, leading him to a man\r\nwhom he recognized to be seated, and ordered him (the witness) to\r\nstrike him with the dagger, a thing which he dare not do either. He\r\nwas then conducted into a room and addressed by a person he knew\r\nto be Bonifacio by the voice, who informed him that he could not\r\nretrace his steps because he knew of the existence of the society,\r\nbut he could not assist at the juntas nor could they teach him the\r\nsigns of recognition till he had been re-initiated; they moreover\r\nmade him sign two sheets of blank paper, causing him to swear never\r\nto reveal the existence of the society to anyone, under the pain of\r\nassassination. They then removed the bandage which he was blindfolded\r\nand he saw around him eight or nine individuals dressed in cloaks and\r\nhoods; he signed the two sheets of paper and was again blindfolded\r\nand conducted to a considerable distance from the house where the\r\nbandage was again removed.\r\n\r\nAnother member of the Katipunan in his declaration made on the 22nd\r\nof September 1896, stated that during the month of February 1893, one\r\nSunday morning, a certain Estanislao Legaspi entered his store, telling\r\nhim to accompany him in a calesa. He listened to tirades against\r\nthe Spanish Government till their arrival at the house of a certain\r\nTranquilino Torres, in calle Elcano. Here \"his eyes were bandaged by\r\nLegaspi and he was handed over to the care of another individual who\r\nconducted him to the upper story of the house and made him sit down;\r\nhe then heard a person whom he knew to be Legaspi by his voice speak,\r\nsaying several things against the Spanish Government, demanding of him\r\nan oath of blind obedience, and a defense of the Philippines till the\r\nshedding of the last drop of his blood, threatening him with fearful\r\npunishments if he should turn traitor. This ceremony being terminated,\r\nhis eyes were unbound and he saw, on a table, a skull which they\r\nmade him kiss, and Legaspi handed him a lance commanding him to wound\r\nhimself in the arm; but he felt a feeling of faintheartedness come over\r\nhim, and manifested to those present that he had not courage enough\r\nto wound himself and wished that the oath he had taken be enough;\r\nhe was dispensed from the operation. When the bandage was removed the\r\neight individuals composing the junta were masked with black hoods, but\r\nafter he kissed the skull and attempted to wound himself they removed\r\nthe hoods and he then recognized Estanislao Legaspi who presided,\r\nMariano de Vera, Teodoro Plata and Juan de la Cruz who was a clerk\r\nof the Tabacalera, and who had led him upstairs; he did not know the\r\nother three. The witness paid two pesos as entrance fee promising\r\nto pay 50 cents monthly. He asked Legaspi what association it was,\r\nand he replied that it was the Liga Filipina.\"\r\n\r\nIn the daily report of the secret police department made to General\r\nBlanco on the 30th of June 1896, is the following notice:\r\n\r\n\"Herewith is given translated most faithfully from Tagalog, the\r\nresult of an interview held with a well-to-do indian who belonged to\r\nthe most popular of the masonic lodges, who tried to draw into it a\r\nfriend. Questioned upon certain affairs, he said: \"In the masonic\r\nlodges of San Juan del Monte and of Pandacan, the whole pueblo,\r\nrich and poor, is inscribed.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the reunions the brethren attend blind-folded, and the chiefs\r\nwith the face covered.\"\r\n\r\n\"The person who desires to enter the lodge is obliged to have his\r\nface covered and his eyes bandaged in sign of blind obedience; the\r\nproofs are carried out and signature made as follows. The person\r\nreceiving the initiated takes a dagger and gives it to him saying to\r\nhim: do you swear to be steel like that which you hold in your hand\r\nand not to bend in the exigencies which oppress and vex us, and to\r\nlabor in pro of the independence of your enslaved country? I swear\r\nanswers the person to be initiated. Do you swear not to have father,\r\nmother, wife, child nor any relative but the revenging arm which shall\r\nsleep and live with you? I swear. They then surround him with arms\r\nof all classes and say to him: here is thy family, thy only work,\r\nand may it give thee thy life and open thy eyes for thy good of the\r\ncountry. They then make a small incision in the form of a cross in\r\nthe right arm near the shoulder.\"\r\n\r\n\"At present our meetings are held at night and in the most lonely\r\nfields, with the object of not being surprised.\"\r\n...................................................................\r\n\r\n\"It is well known among us masons that Rizal is attributed with the\r\nfaculty of being able to translate his person instantaneously from\r\none point to another.\"\r\n...................................................................\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 51. Juan Castaneda testified on the 21st of September 1896 before\r\nthe Chief Inspector of the Corps of Vigilance that \"he was recommended\r\nto make the greatest amount of propaganda possible, of Japanese ideas\r\nin the pueblo of Imus.\" The Japanese ideas here spoken of were those\r\nof the foundation of the Japanese protectorate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 52. Money! money!! money!!! was the great cry in the majority of\r\nthe masonic correspondence between the workers in Spain and those who\r\nhad to supply the funds here. On the 8th of June 1892 Morayta wrote\r\nto bro. Panday-Pira informing him (a favorite custom of Morayta's)\r\nthat what was wanted was \"money to invite journalists (to dine or\r\ntake a drink) and to pay articles in the papers.\" Morayta, probably\r\nwith tears in his eyes, in ending his letter, heaves a sigh, whilst\r\nhis fingers itching for the touch of gold, nervously clutch the pen\r\nwhich scrawls these words: \"if we only had here a good administrator\r\nwith funds then you would see how we should advance!\"\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of June 1892 the secretary of the Gr. Or. Esp. wrote to\r\nthe same explaining how \"in a few meetings, a couple of banquets and\r\na few presents made at the right time\" much could be accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 53. Rizal had money troubles previously with Pilar in Madrid\r\n(see note 39). The excessive earnest and zeal displayed at the\r\ntime of the foundation of the Liga by Rizal died away on his\r\ndeportation. This zeal was owing to the captivating manner in which\r\nthe founder demonstrated to his audience the brilliant future to be\r\nattained by such an undertaking. Rizal had the advantage of a ready\r\noratory and like Bonifacio, drew his hearers to his cause in spite of\r\nthemselves. And then again, the same as in masonry, the association\r\nwas secret, and its true end and aim were but whispered; and whilst\r\nmany of the associated were laboring to assist, as they thought, in\r\nthe fomentation of the culture and advancement of the country, they\r\nwere in reality playing with the toy allotted to them by the society,\r\nwhilst the chief members, those members best suited to be masons,\r\nas says the Gr. Sec. of the Gr. Or. Esp. [43], carried on the true\r\nwork of the Liga. As in the lower degrees of any secret society,\r\nand of masonry in particular, the members are unaware of what is\r\naimed at in the degrees to which they have not attained, to which\r\nall cannot attain, and the secrets of which are zealously guarded,\r\nso it was in the Liga.\r\n\r\nUpon its re-establishment the Liga counted among its members several\r\nwho aimed at the leadership. The absence of Rizal, deported to Dapitan,\r\nleft open the door for unbridled ambition. Everyone wanted to be the\r\nhead. This together with money troubles brought about considerable ill\r\nfeeling between the absent founder and those continuing the work of the\r\nassociation. Rizal had so far kept up a continual secret communication\r\nwith the Liga, thanks to the liberty allowed him by his keepers in\r\nMindanao, who guarded him with scandalous carelessness; and thanks also\r\nto the emissaries sent to him from Manila in search of instructions\r\nand advice. The result of the ill-feeling thus brought about was the\r\nrupture in official relations between the Liga and its founder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 54. See note 39.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 55. One of the facts clearly developed in the trials of\r\nthose suspected of treason, was that the guilty ones had taken the\r\nutmost care not to leave behind them traces of their work. This was\r\nprincipally the case with Rizal and the other chief workers of the\r\nrevolt, and of those who formed the association of Compromisarios.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 56. Both Pedro and Francisco Roxas were honorary councillors of\r\nthe Administration. On the 19th of September 1896 Blanco published\r\nthe following decrees:\r\n\r\n\"In as much as Sr. D. Francisco Roxas, honorary councillor of the\r\nAdministration is found under process in the courts of law: in the\r\nuse of the faculties in me invested, I decree that he cease from the\r\nexercise of his functions etc., etc.\"\r\n\r\nAnd on the 30th of September the following:\r\n\r\n\"In as much as the Excellent Sr. D. Pedro P. Roxas, honorary councillor\r\nof the Administration has been found under process in the courts of\r\nlaw, for rebellion; in the use of my faculties, etc., etc.\"\r\n\r\nMoises Salvador y Francisco testified (fols. 1138-1143) that \"among\r\nthe persons who sympathised with the cause and who aided it with\r\ntheir means for its realization, he remembered D. Pedro Roxas and\r\nD. Francisco Roxas ... (and others); and there existed in the provinces\r\nothers whose names he could not remember.\"\r\n\r\nDomingo Franco y Tuason testified on the 30th of September 1896\r\n(fols. 1332-1337) that \"in another of the several interviews he\r\nhad with Francisco L. Roxas, he asked him if in the circle of his\r\nrelations (with the association) he counted with persons who had\r\noffered to aid the objects and ends of the Liga. Sr. Roxas replied:\r\nYes. And in proof thereof he drew from a drawer in his desk a record\r\nwhich he read, and among the names he read the witness remembered\r\nthose of don P. Roxas and others.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Francisco Roxas found himself in danger of arrest, he attempted\r\nto flee to Hong-Kong, but was captured on board the ship which was to\r\ncarry him there. From the ship he was conducted under arrest to the\r\nComendancia of the Veterana where he remained several days, at the\r\nend of which he was transferred to the Fort of Santiago.\r\n\r\nFrancisco was a millionaire who had received from Spain a name and\r\nreputation superior to his personal merits, and yet in spite of\r\nall that the mother-country had done for him in raising him up to a\r\nposition to which he could never have attained without her aid, he was\r\nfound to have placed himself in the vanguard of the bitterest enemies\r\nof his country. He was the director of the workings of separatism\r\nand was the chief provider of arms for the revolt, as was testified\r\nby innumerable witnesses. [44]\r\n\r\nOn the eve of his execution for treason Francisco penned the following\r\nabjuration:\r\n\r\n\"I, Francisco L. Roxas, on the eve of my death, in reparation for what\r\nin my words and actions may have offended my neighbor; for warning\r\nof others of my person and in order to satisfy my conscience, to the\r\nend that no one, and especially my children, fall into the net of\r\nfreemasonry, or of any other secret society, all of which I detest\r\nand curse, and be not in a day to come ungrateful sons of our Mother\r\nSpain, beg pardon for all my faults and bad example.\"\r\n\r\n\"I die in the Holy Roman Catholic Apostolic faith in which I was born\r\nand educated in a christian manner. I admit all that she admits and\r\ncondemn all that she condemns.\"\r\n\r\n\"This I sign with my own hand with entire liberty.\"\r\n\r\nJany. 10th 1897 in Manila, Royal Fort of\r\nSantiago.--F. L. Roxas:--Witnesses: Antonio Pardo and Felix Garcia.\r\n\r\nOn January 11th Gov. Gen. Polavieja telegraphed to Madrid as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Sentenced by council of War, to-day there have been executed (shot)\r\ntwelve persons guilty of treason ... among them Francisco Roxas,\r\nCouncillor of Administration; Nijaga, Lieut. of native infantry;\r\nVillaroel, Villareal, Moises Salvador and others.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPedro Roxas was also a millionaire who inherited a good fortune, which,\r\nunder the shelter of official protection multiplied considerably. Spain\r\nhonored him with the grand cross of Isabela la Catolica. Like Francisco\r\nhe was a Councillor of Administration. He possessed a large estate\r\nin Nasugbu which, when the revolt broke out, became an insurgent\r\nhornet's nest. There the rebels had a cannon, three falconettes and\r\na large number of arms.\r\n\r\nAfter having been deprived of his office by decree previously\r\nmentioned, Pedro Roxas secured in some way or other from Blanco,\r\npermission to go to Spain. On arrival at Singapore he landed and\r\nremained there. Later on he was defended in the Spanish Cortes by\r\nSr. Romero Robledo [45]. In Manila, to those who could judge of\r\nthe facts on the spot, this defence came as a thunderbolt. However,\r\nthe Spanish paper El Correo in the issue of August 15th said:\r\n\r\n\"The conduct of Sr. Roxas results satisfactorily cleared, so that\r\nno doubt remains in respect to his complete disconnection with the\r\nrevolt.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the separatist element Pedro Roxas was known as the Emperor\r\nPedro I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 57. Maximo M. A. Paterno was the father of the well known Pedro\r\nPaterno. Maximo was in his latter days the leading spirit of the\r\ncelebrations held in honor of the amnesty proclaimed in 1900, by the\r\nlate President McKinley. He died at the age of 76, just before the\r\ncelebrations took place.\r\n\r\nThis amnesty celebration, like most things attempted by Filipinos\r\nalone, turned but a fiasco, the speeches which were to be delivered\r\non the occasion not being in any way in keeping with the oath\r\nof allegiance taken by the speakers. The speeches contemplated\r\nwere in advocation of practically the same thing as that for which\r\nthe rebels had been keeping up an armed struggle, and so, when the\r\nU. S. Commission was invited by Pedro Paterno to be present thereat,\r\nit naturally was unable to accept the invitation.\r\n\r\nThe whole celebration was an abortive attempt on the part of its\r\norganizers to antagonize the Military and Civil authorities. Mr. Taft,\r\nas president of the Commission, at first accepted the invitation\r\nextended, supposing the speeches to be given, had been censored by\r\nthe proper authorities, at that time the military; but on finding that\r\nthis was not so, he declined in the name of the other members of the\r\nCommission, and thus avoided the unpleasantness of being present at\r\na banquet at which both the Military and the Civil authorities would\r\nbe insulted and the Government of the U. S. defied.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of July 1900, the day of the banquet, Mr. Taft on behalf\r\nof his fellow Commissioners, addressed a letter to Pedro Paterno on\r\nthe subject. See Appendix J.\r\n\r\nPedro Paterno was one of those who for a considerable time refused\r\nto take the oath of allegiance; with him were others, Mabini in\r\nparticular.\r\n\r\nMaximo Paterno had received from Spain the Cross of Knight of the\r\nRoyal and American Order of Isabela La Catolica.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 58. And others: Among the names mentioned in many of the documents\r\nI have consulted on the subject of the trials of those guilty of\r\ntreason, I have frequently come across those of Linjap (Mariano),\r\nChidian (Telesforo), Yangco (Luis R.), and others. Of this latter\r\nDomingo Franco was asked during his trial, if Luis R. Yangco had\r\nassisted at any reunion of the compromisarios, to which he replied\r\nthat he (Yangco) had not assisted at any session (fols. 1381-1382).\r\n\r\nAs I have already remarked in another note, many of those charged\r\nwith complicity in the affairs of the revolt were latter on proved\r\nto be innocent. That considerable number of the wealthy natives\r\nand half-castes sympathised more or less with the idea of greater\r\nliberality in government, is undoubtedly true, but that they extended\r\ntheir sympathies to the aims of the hordes of cut-throats led by\r\nBonifacio is absurd.\r\n\r\nThe leading Filipinos and many insular Spaniards sighed for privileges\r\nwhich the Government of Madrid did not deem well to concede. To bring\r\npressure upon the Government some of these combined to support in\r\nthe metropolis, some of their number who should keep up the work of\r\nagitation. This agitation however took a form displeasing to many,\r\nwho thereupon ceased to lend it their aid and consent. But few of the\r\nleaders of the people, especially of the wealthy ones, desired to\r\ncut themselves adrift from Spain, and not till a few insignificant\r\nbeings such as Aguinaldo, Bonifacio, Mabini, and Pilar (Pio del)\r\nand Buencamino came upon the scene did the idea of independence\r\nof the island really take form. A faint idea of such a thing as\r\nindependence did exist formerly, but the enlightened Filipinos saw,\r\nonly too clearly, the probable result.\r\n\r\nThe wealthy proprietors here cited, no doubt sympathised more or\r\nless with the Liga Filipina in its beginning, whilst it was under\r\nthe complete control of its founder Rizal; but as the Liga lost the\r\ncharacter given to it by Rizal, and underwent the change it did,\r\nit is only natural to suppose that many of its former supporters\r\nleft it as they would a sinking ship. However the fact that they\r\nwere identified with the original Liga seems to have been taken as\r\na proof of their connection with the revolt. This is certainly the\r\nopinion expressed by Sr. Diaz.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 59. Mactan is the name of the island upon which Magallanes, the\r\nfamous explorer, met his death at the hands of the savage hordes who\r\nat that time peopled the land. Names of places and persons associated\r\nwith the disasters suffered by Spain, were greatly admired among the\r\nseparatists. Surely Mactan, an island peopled by savages at the time\r\nof its chief notoriety, and Mayon, the site of a destructive volcano,\r\nare very suitable names to give to such centers as were the popular\r\ncouncils of Trozo and Sta. Cruz.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 60. On the 30th of August 1895, the Civil Governor of Batangas\r\nasked of the commander of the Guardia Civil of Lemery, information\r\nconcerning \"persons in the pueblo of Taal who were distinguished\r\nfor their separatists opinions\". The said commander replied that a\r\nreport on all such persons would be unending, and proceeded to cite\r\nthe case of Felipe Agoncillo to personify the said separatist element,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"Among the group of the chief ones and as chief of them, stands\r\nFelipe Agoncillo, proprietor and lawyer.\" He then goes on to explain\r\nhow Agoncillo imposed his will upon every one in the pueblo, even\r\nupon the Municipality, no law or regulation sent even by the highest\r\nauthorities going into force until it had been passed upon by him. \"It\r\nwould be difficult,\" says he, \"for me to collect any perfect proof of\r\nhis anti-Spanish tendencies which are, however, self-evident to the\r\nSpanish element of this province.\" This report, which was a sufficient\r\nwarning of danger, was sent to the Gov. of Batangas on the 18th of\r\nSeptember 1895. He immediately forwarded it to Gen. Blanco. About\r\nthree months afterwards Blanco looked into the matter, circumstances\r\ndemanding that some steps should be taken to preserve national honor;\r\nand he decided to deport six of the separatists as an example to\r\nthe remainder. Of these six one was Agoncillo. This industrious\r\nfilibuster had influential and watchful friends in Manila, who,\r\nupon seeing the turn things were taking, telegraphed him \"Cafe en\r\nbaja; fuera existencias.\" This was warning sufficient and Agoncillo\r\naccompanied by Ramon Atienza succeeded in escaping.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of April the Japanese Mail Steamer Hiorine left Manila. On\r\nthis steamer Agoncillo fled, hidden it is said, in a coal bunk. The\r\nHeraldo de Madrid of the 16th of September 1896, in speaking of the\r\naffair says: \"Agoncillo gave the captain of the ship the sum of 350\r\npesos as gratification and on this account had placed at his disposal\r\nupon arrival at Kobe, a ship's boat, whilst the remaining passengers\r\nhad to hire their transportation.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of May 1896, the secret police of Manila reported to\r\nGen. Blanco, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Notice is hereby given of the sailing for Japan of Felipe Agoncillo,\r\nproperty-owner of the province of Batangas, who goes to put himself\r\nat the disposition of the junta magna (in Japan), carrying with him\r\nsome 80,000 pesos collected in Lipa, Taal and other pueblos, for the\r\nsustainment of anti-Spanish propaganda.\"\r\n\r\nLike most of the leaders of the separatist campaign, Agoncillo was\r\nastute. He partook of that peculiar trait of the native character: a\r\nsharpness of perception, a cuteness which one not acquainted with the\r\nindian would take for intelligence. An Indian will often do something\r\nremarkable, but in spite of its appearance of being an extraordinary\r\naction, a result of a well thought out plan, it proceeds in ninety-nine\r\ncases out of a hundred, from instinct rather from intelligence. Native\r\npeoples are more accustomed to use their common-sense than most of us\r\nand hence arises the fact, that frequently the Filipino has outwitted\r\nboth the military and the civil authorities. England learned this\r\nlesson in dealing with the Oriental in India, Spain learned it here,\r\nand America has yet to discover the same truth.\r\n\r\nMr. Wildman [46], the late U. S. Consul at Hong-Kong, once affirmed of\r\nAgoncillo, \"Sr. Agoncillo is a very intelligent and daring diplomat\r\n(the Government later on found him to be far more daring than\r\nintelligent), and could fill the position of chief of any department\r\nof State in any civilized country.\" But then, it was nothing strange\r\nfor Wildman to make such breaks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 61. Among these honorable exceptions which Sr. Diaz says he has\r\ngreat pleasure in recognizing, might be mentioned several who were\r\nfalsely accused and whose names have gone down to the reading public\r\nin the works of various writers who wrote in good faith, branded with\r\nthe mark of ingratitude which characterized and still characterizes\r\nso many natives and half-castes.\r\n\r\nIt gives a careful student of the subject more than passing pleasure to\r\nbe able to give the lie to those who in their testimony classified as\r\nmembers of the infernal plot to \"cut the throats of every Spaniard,\r\nwithout regard even to parentage\", the names of some of the most\r\nprominent Filipinos of to-day, men who although they have not grovelled\r\nin the dust before the conqueror and accepted positions under the new\r\nGovernment, are more truly prominent than those who assert themselves\r\nas the \"leaders\" of the people.\r\n\r\nAmong these honorable exceptions there were many who although they came\r\nto form part of the so-called Revolutionary Government, did so only\r\nwhen Spanish rule had ceased to exist, and when the accepted opinion\r\nwas that a government elected by the people would be recognized by\r\nthe U. S. These, however, were never traitors to the mother country;\r\nthey were men who treated Spain as every honorable man should treat his\r\ncountry. These were not men who changed their religion as they changed\r\ntheir clothes: to suit the occasion. They were not men who concealed\r\ntheir titles to freemason degrees, at the bottom of their trunks,\r\nand exposed them with pride upon the change of sovereignty. These men\r\nwere never perjurers, never traitors. Born and raised in the bosom of\r\nthe Catholic faith they remained faithful to it, and faithful to the\r\ntraditions of the country which gave them their political being; and\r\nit is with great pleasure that, with Sr. Diaz, I also can say, that\r\nI have great pleasure in recognizing these honorable exceptions, and\r\nin proof thereof have I dedicated this small historical sketch to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 62. Day by day the morality in the administration of the funds\r\nbecame worse, and so intense did the ill-feeling engendered by pride\r\nbecome, that the members forgot all about the fomentation of the\r\nculture and advancement of the country. Like a nursery full of willful\r\nchildren, they all wanted their own way, and when they could not have\r\nit, some cried: \"now I shan't play,\" \"now I'll go and tell ma;\" this\r\nperhaps was the chief cause of the dissolution of the association,\r\nfor some did go and tell \"ma;\" and the wealthy members, and those who\r\nhad anything to lose, were immediately overcome with abject fear lest\r\n\"ma\" should punish them with a good spanking.\r\n\r\n\"In the month of October 1893, the Superior Council becoming\r\naware that some documents pertaining, to the Liga had been handed\r\nover to the offices of the General Government, the dissolution\r\nof the society was determined.\"--Testimony of Domingo Franco y\r\nTuason. (fols. 1,299-1,303).\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of May 1896, notice was given by the secret police to\r\nGovernor General Blanco, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Notice is herewith given of the existence in Manila, of a Society\r\nnamed La Liga Filipina, to which are affiliated a large number of\r\nindividuals....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 63. The testimony given by many of the political prisoners as\r\nto the foundation, aims and work of the Compromisarios is somewhat\r\nconflicting. For instance: Antonio Salazar, (fols. 1,008-1,013)\r\ntestified that on account of the mal-administration of the funds,\r\n\"the subscription on behalf of La Propaganda ceased, and under\r\nthe name of Compromisarios was founded an association composed of\r\n... (here follow names of members), and seeing that they could not\r\ngather sufficient funds, they agreed to increase the subscription\r\nand seek persons to associate with them.\"\r\n\r\nOn another occasion the same witness testified (fols. 1,014-1,018) that\r\ncertain persons whom he named were the \"Compromisarios, who were in\r\ncommunion with Marcelo (del Pilar), and who remitted money to him.\" He\r\nalso stated that \"on account of the bad conduct observed in Madrid by\r\nPilar, ... some of the Compromisarios refused to send him resources.\"\r\n\r\nIn reply to a question as to the relationship between the\r\nCompromisarios and the Katipunan, he gave as his opinion, that \"there\r\ncould be no doubt that both societies aimed at the same end.\" At\r\nfols. 1118-1129 the same witness affirmed that \"as the partisans\r\nof Rizal and Pilar ... saw that neither masonry nor the Liga could\r\nhope for funds [47], they formed the society of Compromisarios among\r\nwealthy persons of Manila and the Provinces.\"\r\n\r\nDomingo Franco affirmed that the outbreak of the revolt came as a\r\ngreat surprise to the Compromisarios.\r\n\r\nAs to the aims of the society, Moises Salvador y Francisco is authority\r\nfor the statement that: \"in one of the juntas they treated of the\r\nprovision of arms and other material of war; and it was agreed,\r\nmoreover, to gather funds for the said expenses, and as the junta\r\nreplied that it was impossible at that time, a committee was appointed,\r\ncomposed of Jose Ramos, Doroteo Cortes and Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista,\r\nto draw up a petition for the aid of Japan.\"\r\n\r\nMoises also affirmed (fols. 1,296-1,299) that the Supreme Council of\r\nthe Compromisarios was formed as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n            President           Domingo Franco.\r\n            Secretary           Apolinario Mabini.\r\n            Treasurer           Bonifacio Arevalo.\r\n                             /  Numeriano Adriano.\r\n            Vocales          +  Ambrosio Bautista.\r\n                             \\  Moises Salvador.\r\n\r\n\r\nDomingo Franco (fol. 1,299-1,303) testified that upon the dissolution\r\nof the Liga, and in the month of October 1894, there gathered together\r\nin a house of the witness, Numeriano Adriano, Apolinario Mabini,\r\nIsidoro Francisco, Deodato Arellano and the witness, and it was\r\ndecided to constitute the association known as the Compromisarios,\r\nendeavouring to gather as many as forty members, each paying a monthly\r\nsubscription of 5 pesos, for the sustainment of the La Solidaridad.\r\n\r\nThe same witness also testified (fols. 1,332-1,337) that \"The Liga\r\nand the Katipunan were constituted in three groups, viz.: the Supreme\r\nCouncil or the aristocracy, under the presidency of Francisco L. Roxas;\r\nthe Compromisarios or middle classes, divided into juntas or local\r\ncouncils.... The third aggregation was the Katipunan under the\r\npresidency of Andres Bonifacio, and was composed of the lower classes.\r\n\r\nFrom all this we gather that the association of Compromisarios\r\nwas founded with the idea of collecting funds to continue the work\r\ncommenced by masonry and the Liga. The association was, practically,\r\na committee formed to take up the work of the Liga, but formed in\r\nsuch a manner as to avoid suspicion, and all compromise with the late\r\nLiga. In its formation, its duties and its methods, it differed from\r\nboth the Liga and from the Katipunan, but whilst differing from them\r\nit formed a tie between them, carrying on a work which the Katipunan\r\ncould not carry on of itself. The Liga died; and its mantle fell upon\r\nthe Compromisarios. This society inspired, watched over and protected\r\nthe labor of its successor, the Katipunan, the fighting machine of\r\nthe separatist or filibuster element.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 64. The idea which appeared to pervade the minds of the so-called\r\nprogressive Filipinos was that with a code of laws a la Europea,\r\nthe adoption of some or other new fangled idea imported from France,\r\nGermany or anywhere but the Peninsular, the Filipino would immediately\r\nattain the advancement and culture enjoyed among the Japanese. To\r\nanyone not acquainted with either the Filipino or the Japanese, such\r\nan idea might be acceptable; but no student of Oriental races, nor even\r\nthe mere casual observer of these two peoples, would venture to predict\r\nthan even with all the advantages of modernism the Filipino now enjoys,\r\nwill he, as a people, attain to such a state of culture as that enjoyed\r\nby the sons of the Empire of the Rising Sun even in a hundred years.\r\n\r\nAmong the European peoples the progress of civilization and\r\nregeneration was slow but it was none the less decisive. Among\r\nOrientals it is, as a rule, quick but not lasting. Among almost all\r\nOriental peoples the rising generation is bright and gives signs of\r\ngreat possibilities; but these youths after having passed with honors\r\nthrough college and university, too often end their lives as they began\r\nthem--as children. What the Oriental lacks is stability. Nothing is\r\nmore common in the Philippines than to find that your cook or coachman\r\nhas completed four-fifths of his studies as lawyer, doctor or something\r\nelse. The Filipino who has reached the age of thirty and has not,\r\nin these days, been bata [48] in a convent or with a private family,\r\nbeen cochero, cook, collector of accounts for some business house,\r\nletter-carrier, postman, policeman, musician in a church choir,\r\nfireman, and connected with a few other employments of more or less\r\nimportance, is by no means a rara avis, to say nothing of the many\r\nwho have also been majors and generals in the insurgent \"army\", and\r\nwithout stopping to consider a pair of very prominent natives who\r\nfrom batas in the University of Sto. Tomas have, after a series of\r\npolitical intrigues, risen to positions of law-tinkers over a people,\r\nthe vast majority of whom hate and despise them.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact the very best of the filipino politicians and\r\nother local men of fame, bright, learned and progressive though they\r\nbe, would count but little side by side with the foremost sons of the\r\nFlowery Kingdom. To find in Yokohama, or even in Nagasaki or Kobe, or\r\nany other city of Japan, a hundred Rizals, a hundred Pilars (Marcelos,\r\nPios or Gregorios), a hundred Apacibles, or Mabinis, or Aguinaldos,\r\nor Buencaminos or Taveras would be an easy task. But to find in the\r\nPhilippines a Marquis Ito, a Mutsu, a Yamata or a Matsugata,--that\r\nis the question.\r\n\r\nAnd why? Because at the time when Spain discovered these islands,\r\nfinding the people in a state of social and moral degradation,\r\nwithout formal government or any social organization beyond the\r\ntribal system (and that but limited) common to almost all savage\r\npeoples, the Japanese had already counted with more than 1000 years\r\nof more or less stable government, always organized, and with a\r\nsocial organization and a firm national unity. The people of Japan,\r\nat that time, cultivated the arts and sciences, enjoyed the fruits of\r\nprosperous industries and of external commerce. They had a religion and\r\na language which could be written and understood when written. Three\r\nhundred years ago, when the Filipinos were just commencing to learn\r\nthe difference between man and beast, the Japanese was enjoying a\r\nrelative civilization not yet attained by the Chinese, much less by\r\nthe partisans of the separatist leaders of Luzon and the Visayas.\r\n\r\nNo country has ever done for her colonial children what Spain did\r\nfor the Filipinos during the three centuries she held control over\r\nthe Archipelago; and yet how far are the people from the state of\r\nculture of the Japanese! Well might the leaders of the people look\r\nto Japan as a model!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 65. Domingo Franco (fols. 1,332-1,337) testified that on a\r\ncertain day \"he went to see Francisco L. Roxas and asked him if it\r\nwere certain that he had been to the house of Cortes, and had arranged\r\nmatters in respect to the Commission which should go to Japan; to which\r\nSr. Roxas replied, yes; and that it was agreed that Cortes should go,\r\ncommissioned to ask of the Japanese Government, help and protection for\r\nthese islands, (the Filipino Government) handing over as a guarantee,\r\none of the islands near Luzon, which the witness believed to be\r\nMindoro on account of its large size and small population.\r\n\r\n\"Antonio Salazar (fol. 1,118-1,129) stated that \"of the junta of\r\ncompromisarios there formed part: Cortes, Espanol and Ramos, who\r\nwere then in Japan petitioning that Empire to aid them with arms,\r\nships and money....\"\r\n\r\nIsabelo de los Reyes, in telling the Governor General, Primo de Rivera,\r\nwhat he affirmed to be the truth of the situation in 1897, stated\r\nthat \"the Filipino burguesses had nominated a commission composed\r\nof Doroteo Cortes, Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista, Jose A. Ramos and\r\nMarcelo H. del Pilar, the latter of whom died in Barcelona whilst on\r\nhis way to Japan. This commission had for its object the securing of\r\nthe protection of that empire; Cortes, as president, gathered funds\r\nto sustain Ramos and Isabelo Artacho Vicos, who were his agents in\r\nthat country.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 66. Antonio Salazar (fols. 1,008-1,013) testified that \"The\r\nyear previous he met Timoteo Paez in Calle Echague, and enquired of\r\nhim if he had moved his residence to Quiapo; Paez replied that he had\r\ntransferred the members of his family to a house of strong materials,\r\nnot wishing to leave them in a nipa [49] house in Tondo, as he was\r\ngoing to Singapore, and after encharging the witness to preserve\r\nsecrecy, told him that he was going there to engage a steamer which\r\nwas to make a trip to Dapitan to steal away Rizal from that place;\r\nmoreover that the date upon which Paez went to Singapore might be\r\nknown by enquiring at the house of Echeita and Co., where the said\r\nPaez was engaged, and which conceded him permission to go.\"\r\n\r\nOn another occasion this same individual testified (fols. 1,118-1,129)\r\nthat \"the Compromisarios agreed to employ the sum (of money gathered\r\nfor another purpose) for the purpose of aiding the stealing away of\r\nthe person of Rizal from Dapitan, for which purpose they sent it\r\n(the money) to Timoteo Paez, at Singapore that he might engage a\r\nsteamer which should go to Dapitan; and as they could not realize the\r\nundertaking, they sent the money to Jose Baza who lived in Hong-Kong,\r\nand Baza sent the money to Sandakan (in Borneo) so that a ship might\r\nbe engaged there for the purpose.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of January 1895, the Gr. Pres. of the Gr. Cons. Reg.,\r\nbro. Musa, gr. 18, wrote to the lodge Modestia, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                        \"A. L. G. D. G. A. D. U.\r\n\r\n                   A la Resp. Log. Modestia No. 199.\r\n\r\n                                S. F. U.\r\n\r\n        Ven. Maes. Pres.\r\n\r\n    \"Our very beloved bro. Dimas-Alang (Jose Rizal, see foot-note,\r\n    page 47), who for some time has been, as you know, expiating\r\n    in Dapitan, faults he has not committed [50], is authorized to\r\n    change his residence, under the condition that it be in some part\r\n    of Spain and not in the Archipelago.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Together with this notice we have received another that the\r\n    said bro. lacks absolutely the resources for such a long voyage\r\n    ... etc.\"\r\n    ................................................................\r\n\r\n    \"In virtue of this, I write to you that, bearing in mind what I\r\n    have explained, you may arrange to be collected from the members,\r\n    the pecuniary aid they wish and are able to contribute for the\r\n    meritorious work in question.\"\r\n\r\n        The Gr. Pres., Muza.\r\n\r\n\r\nJose Dison Matanza testified (fols. 1,132-1,138) that \"the Secret\r\nCamara of the Katipunan gathered together and decided upon another\r\nplan, which was, as Bonifacio told the witness, to embark a large\r\nnumber of people as passengers on a ship which was to go to Dapitan;\r\nand these when they were upon the high seas, were to surprise the\r\ncrew and take possession of the ship; they should then steal away\r\nRizal from Dapitan and take him wherever they could.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 67. If elsewhere in the history of the workings of separatism\r\nin the Philippines, proof were wanting of the cruel deceit practiced\r\nby the filibuster leaders upon the ignorants who formed the mass of\r\nthe secret associations of masonic origin, here in this instance it\r\nwould be found in abundance. Taking the whole question of the part\r\nplayed by Japan or by individual Japanese in the separatist movement\r\nfrom beginning to end I am strongly of the opinion that the supposed\r\nassistance, whether in the form of arms and ammunition, or in that of\r\nfinancial or moral support was a deliberate imposture, and that those\r\ncredulous persons who contributed with their hard-earned money towards\r\nthe sums said to have been utilized for propaganda in Japan, were\r\ndefrauded, not only out of the money they gave to the funds, but also\r\nof what they might legitimately hope for as a result of the expenditure\r\nof the said funds. It is a well known fact that the hopes of the people\r\nwere kept up by many statements which were absolutely unfounded [51];\r\nthe assertions of Cortes, Ramos and others who performed the duties\r\nof the embassy to Japan, were most probably of this nature.\r\n\r\nThe person who, during the trials of those accused of treason,\r\ngave the most interesting testimony relative to this matter, was\r\nJuan Castaneda. He affirmed that \"on account of family troubles,\r\nand for questions arising from losses at gambling, and in view of\r\nhis having robbed his mother, he decided to leave for Hong-Kong,\r\nembarking on the SS. Esmeralda, on the 31st of July 1895\" [52]. He\r\nwent on to describe how he there met his friend, the native ex-priest\r\nSevero Buenaventura; how the said Buenaventura initiated him into\r\nthe secrets of freemasonry, and how this native ex-priest had\r\nbeen himself initiated by Ambrosio Flores [53]. That they later\r\non decided to go to Japan sailing on the SS. Natal. That on their\r\narrival at Yokohama they lodged at the house of Jose Ramos, where\r\nthere also lived Artacho. \"During the first days of their stay Ramos\r\nand Artacho seemed to look upon them with want of confidence, and\r\nhid from them their conversations.\" He affirmed also that among the\r\nvisitors to the house of Ramos were a Mr. Hirata, a professor of law,\r\nintermediary between Ramos and Prince Konoy, resident in Tokyo, and\r\nalso, a Mr. Yosida, merchant. He stated also that \"to excuse their\r\nfrequent absence, Ramos and Artacho assured him that they had been\r\nto Tokyo to interview the dignitaries of the Empire, Prince Konoy,\r\nGeneral Yamagata and the count of Tokogana, one of the ministers who\r\nhad been Japanese ambassador to the court of Italy. Ramos assured them\r\nthat, with these Japanese politicians they were arranging the securing\r\nof the independence of the Philippines, to which end the Japanese\r\noffered to land here 100,000 rifles with their ammunition, the cost\r\nof which should be paid for in a fixed number of years ... etc., etc.\"\r\n\r\nIsabelo de los Reyes [54] says on this point:\r\n\r\n\"According to what is said, Ramos interviewed, on several occasions,\r\nPrince Konoy, General Yamagata and the Count of Tokogana, who was\r\nthen a minister. These gentlemen, it seems, were sympathizers with the\r\nidea of our independence under the protectorate of Japan, as in Korea,\r\nand that they proposed, as a means of gaining it, the fomentation of\r\nJapanese immigration in the Philippines, and that when once this was\r\nattained, the seeking of a conflict with Spain.\"\r\n\r\nFurther on he states that: \"Some days before the insurrection broke\r\nout, Isabelo Artacho brought me a letter from Jose A. Ramos, in which\r\nhe gave me an account of the efforts they were exerting to influence\r\nthe leading politicians of Japan, to the end that they should aid us to\r\nsecure our independence. Artacho told me verbally the details and that\r\nhe knew that the liberal party of Japan, which then was the opposition,\r\nsympathized with the idea, and proposed as a means of attaining it,\r\nthe seeking of a cause of conflict with Spain, introducing Japanese\r\nemigrants to that end.\"\r\n\r\nMoises Salvador (fols. 1,138-1,143) stated that according to letters\r\nreceived by Bonifacio Arevalo from Cortes and Ramos, these two had\r\nbeen received by the Japanese minister of foreign affairs, to whom\r\nthey expounded the object of their journey; and as the minister asked\r\nthem what money they had to cover the expenses of the enterprise,\r\nthey replied that they would pay their way with the money they should\r\nseize, pertaining to the Religions Orders and to the Treasury [55];\r\nand being satisfied, the Japanese minister told them they might prepare\r\nthemselves, for he would send them arms in June or July, to the coast\r\nof Luzon, to be disembarked near the island of Polillo....\"\r\n\r\nThat the separatists hoped for, and aimed to secure the aid of Japan\r\nis certain; many testified to the fact; but this testimony was more or\r\nless hearsay. Certain leading separatists went to Japan to concoct the\r\nscheme and were, no doubt, listened to by some more or less prominent\r\npersons. This is all the more probable when we remember that the\r\ncredentials carried by the Commission took the form of a petition\r\nsigned by some 22,000 Filipinos, that is, it bore that number of\r\nsignatures. [56]\r\n\r\nThe work of propaganda carried on by certain Filipinos cannot be\r\ncalled into question; but what is very uncertain is whether or not\r\nthe Japanese extended the wished and hoped for assistance. To be\r\nreceived in interview, and to be heard with attention, are two very\r\ndifferent things. A father listens to the idle prattle of his child,\r\nbut the childish words leave no other impression on his mind than\r\ntheir cuteness merits at the time. This is probably what occurred\r\nbetween Cortes and Ramos and the so-called \"official\" element of Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes 68 and 69. Pio Valenzuela testified (fols. 582-605) that \"in\r\nthe month of May, a student of Law Daniel Aria y Tirona, came to his\r\nhouse and invited him to go to salute the commander of the Japanese\r\ncruiser the Kongo [57]. That at an hour fixed, there gathered at the\r\nBazar [58], with the witness, Andres Bonifacio, Emilio Jacinto, Jose\r\nDizon and others, who were received by the commander of the cruiser\r\nwith an air of indifference, and of apparent ridicule.... Bonifacio\r\nsaluted and welcomed him to the islands, offering his services. The\r\ncommander replied, thanking them and inviting them to take a voyage\r\nto Japan to visit the towns of that country, and enjoy its beautiful\r\nclimate. Later on they directed a letter to the Commander, Jacinto\r\ndrawing it up and Bonifacio, Dizon and himself and others signing\r\nit; its text was a salutation to the Emperor and Empress of Japan,\r\nand a manifestation of a desire to form a part of the said Empire,\r\netc.... With the letter were presented twelve water-melons [59]\r\nsent by Emilio Aguinaldo, capitan municipal of Cavite Viejo, and a\r\nquantity of mangoes purchased by Cipriano Pacheco, and also a picture.\"\r\n\r\nJose Dizon Matanza questioned on the same subject, affirmed\r\n(fols. 1,132-1,138) that he was invited to the \"Bazar Japones,\" to\r\nsalute and welcome the commander of the cruiser (Kongo).... When he\r\narrived they gave him iced water.... About an hour afterwards there\r\narrived an officer of the ship who said he was the doctor, and soon\r\nafter the commander arrived; all saluted him.... On the evening of\r\nthe same day Bonifacio, Valenzuela and the witness went to Nagtajan\r\nto the house where lived the Japanese who kept the Bazar.... Bonifacio\r\ntold them they had a letter to give them. Three or four days later on,\r\nValenzuela presented himself at the house of the witness with a letter\r\nin Tagalo which read more or less as follows: (here follows what the\r\nwitness remembered of the letter.) Bonifacio signed it as president of\r\nthe Supreme Council of the Katipunan, Jacinto as secretary, Valenzuela\r\nas Fiscal and the witness with the name of Jose Talin.... After the\r\ndeparture of the Commander, the witness enquired of Bonifacio what\r\nresult the letter had obtained, Andres replying that the Commander\r\nhad taken a copy of it, returning the original, because the persons\r\nsigning it were not representative; but that the said officer was\r\nvery pleased with the pictures given in the name of the Katipunan,\r\nand with the melons and mangoes sent from Cavite.\"\r\n\r\nIsabelo de los Reyes affirms that: \"When the Japanese cruiser Kongo\r\nvisited the port of Manila in May 1896, the Supreme Council of the\r\nKatipunan went to salute its commander in the upstairs of the Bazar\r\nJapones, situated in the plaza del Padre Moraga, and handed him a\r\nmanuscript setting forth their desire for the aid and assistance of\r\nJapan towards the gaining of independence for the Philippines. They\r\nalso offered him a picture and some native fruits.\"\r\n\r\n\"The commander received them well and even regaled them with iced\r\ndrinks and coffee, but did not dare to accept the document, limiting\r\nhimself to the taking of a copy of it and promising to transmit their\r\ndesires to the Emperor; he also invited them to make a voyage to his\r\ncountry. Nothing has since been heard of the commander.\"\r\n\r\nSo much for the testimony given concerning the Kongo and its commander.\r\n\r\nInformation I have obtained from Japanese semi-official sources on this\r\npoint, shows that the Kongo steamed into Manila bay in 1896 in the same\r\nmanner as it did recently, on a non-official visit. As was customary,\r\nthe Japanese Commander and other officers visited the Japanese Bazaar\r\nin Plaza Moraga as well as other Japanese business houses. The Bazar\r\nJapones was a center to which friends and acquaintances gathered to\r\nsalute the visiting officers. Upstairs were prepared iced drinks,\r\netc. for those who cared to take them. Bonifacio and others,\r\nuninvited, walked in and presented themselves and their petition and\r\nofferings. The latter the commander accepted; the petition he did not\r\naccept: in this he showed good sense. As to the supposed copy which\r\nhe promised to take, evidence goes to show that it was not taken,\r\nbut that the said commander merely made a few notes of it on a scrap\r\nof paper. The proprietors of the Bazar ridicule the idea that the\r\ncommander favored the petition or received the so-called commission\r\nwith pleasure; their opinion is that to which any investigator of the\r\naffair would come, that the Commander was a gentleman and did not\r\nwish to hurt the feelings, by his refusal, of even such ignorantes\r\nas those who at that time forced themselves upon him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 70. The idea that the Liga was but an introduction to the\r\nKatipunan is not borne out by the facts of the case. The Liga\r\nFilipina was a foundation of Rizal, whilst the Katipunan was a\r\nconception of Pilar who, finding Rizal was carrying all before him,\r\ndetermined not to be out-done by his former companion. The very fact\r\nof the enmity existing between the two leaders is proof enough that\r\nthe two societies were not one and the same thing, although after\r\ntheir foundation they walked arm in arm. The Liga, as an association,\r\nwas eventually dissolved, and from it was formed the Compromisarios\r\n(see note 63) and this body continued its functions till the outbreak\r\nof the revolt. The vicissitudes of the Liga did not lessen Rizal's\r\ninfluence. Ever ready to tell a lie or act one if it were to his own\r\nadvantage, Rizal permitted the free use of his name in connection\r\nwith the Katipunan also. To the vast majority of the oath-bound,\r\nthe Katipunan was but the Liga under another form; and in order that\r\nthe people should not know of the rivalry existing between himself\r\nand Pilar, Rizal gave no signs of disfavor towards the foundation of\r\nthe new society; in fact he rather favored it, seeing that under the\r\ncircumstances it would make him figure as its \"hero,\" and he would thus\r\nbe enabled to take the wind out of Pilar's sails. The only objection\r\nraised by Rizal to the work of the Katipunan, was that which he made\r\nto Valenzuela: that the time had not yet come for armed rebellion.\r\n\r\nAs long as he held supreme influence Rizal was satisfied; but as the\r\nseparatist element was becoming weary at the long absence of its\r\n\"Moses\" and had begun to worship the \"calf\" (not a golden one, by\r\nthe way) \"Moses\" got angry and threw down, in disgust, the \"tables\r\nof the law.\"\r\n\r\nIn its beginning, Rizal was the idol of the Katipunan, in the same\r\nway as Morayta (note 13) was the idol of the rebellious Filipinos\r\nin Madrid, and others parts of the Peninsular. Isabelo de los Reyes\r\n[60] would have us believe that the foundation of the Katipunan\r\nwas a result of the indignation of the people, consequent upon the\r\ndeportation of Rizal. This, in the face of facts, is a very poor\r\nargument and demonstrates either the ignorance or the bad faith of\r\nReyes. And he himself contradicts it a few lines further on by saying\r\n\"that without knowing Rizal, the Katipunan acclaimed him its honorary\r\nPresident.\" This latter they certainly did but not \"without knowing\"\r\nhim. They did so because they knew nothing of his disagreement with\r\nPilar, the real founder of their society, and because the aim of the\r\ntwo societies was practically one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 71. The similarity of character between the Liga and the Katipunan\r\nhas always been a matter of discussion. Some writers would draw a hard\r\nand fast line between the two, considering them as oil and water, two\r\nbodies enemies one of the other; others looking upon them as two oils,\r\nthe one vegetable and the other mineral which, although differing in\r\nnature, mix together thoroughly.\r\n\r\nReyes, in his oft-quoted \"Memoria\" to the then Gov. General, Primo\r\nde Rivera, in a mad attempt to prove that the insurrection was owing\r\nto the \"friars\" and that they attempted to invent the Katipunan plot\r\nto cover up their treason, says:\r\n\r\n\"Above all, the friars committed the criminal and suicidal infamy\r\nof calumniously including in the Katipunan the millionaire and\r\naristocratic element, and the middle classes, the fact being that\r\nthey had nothing in common with the plebeian association which they\r\nnot only despised for its low condition, but which the few who knew of\r\nits existence must have hated, if not for egotism, for the socialistic\r\ntendencies of the said group.\"\r\n\r\nSuch assertions scarcely deserve comment, for from beginning to end,\r\nthe proceedings against the separatists were in the hands of the civil\r\nauthorities, the members of the Religious Orders having no influence\r\nwhatever in the matter, although it was they who, by their watchfulness\r\nover the interests of the country had detected symptoms which they,\r\nas true patriots, made known to the civil authorities. True it is also\r\nthat a friar, Padre Mariano Gil, made known, at a critical moment,\r\nthe plot of the diabolical society, in time to prevent the bloodthirsty\r\nfiends rising in a night and cutting the throats of those who had been\r\ntheir benefactors; but the \"friar\" was never a secret service agent of\r\nthe Government. What he did was what every patriotic Spaniard would\r\nhave done under the circumstances. It was the civil authorities who,\r\nupon the discovery of the plot, caused the arrest of those complicated,\r\nand who tried and passed judgement upon the guilty. If millionaires\r\nand others were counted among the members of the Katipunan it was\r\nbecause they were guilty of the same treason as the katipuneros and\r\nnot because they were \"included\" by the \"friar\".\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"... Association which they not only despised for its low\r\n    condition, but which the few who knew of its existence must have\r\n    hated, if not for egotism, for the socialistic tendencies of the\r\n    said group.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSo says Isabelo de los Reyes, the founder of the late Filipino\r\nDemocratic Party, and the Workman's Democratic Union, the most\r\nsocialist movement in the history of the Philippines. So much for\r\nthe Liberty, Equality and Fraternity which they all professed.\r\n\r\nAnother writer, C. de Valdez, a nom-de-plume under which I recognize\r\nas hidden one whose knowledge on this subject was very extensive,\r\nwho for the study of the question had at his disposition innumerable\r\ndocuments of vital importance, gives as his opinion: \"It has been\r\nsaid that the Liga was a society into the which there entered only\r\nelements of a certain culture, and the people of money; whilst\r\nthe Katipunan was formed for the poor and laboring classes. If by\r\nthis it is intended to signify that they were two close societies,\r\nthe one which should comprehend what we might call the aristocracy\r\nand the other the common people, we cannot agree with the opinion,\r\nbecause it is in contradiction with the facts. There existed a free\r\ncommunication between both societies and the prominent personages of\r\nthe Liga mixed with the humble ones of the Katipunan, taking active\r\npart in the labors and forming part of the reunions and assemblies\r\n[61]; in the same way the individuals of common class entered the files\r\nof the Liga without any distinction of class being drawn between them.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer goes on to show that the three main things needed for the\r\nRevolution were 1st: an active propaganda of separatist ideas; 2nd:\r\nfunds to cover expenses and to purchase arms, and 3rd: a considerable\r\nnumber of persons ready to take up arms in the field. The first two\r\nof these main things were to be attended to by the Liga and the third\r\nby the Katipunan.\r\n\r\n\"In the greatest utility in attaining the ultimate end of the\r\ninitiators and directors of the conspiracy, must be sought the\r\ndistinction between the Liga and the Katipunan, and the difference\r\nwhich the one or the other society enjoyed.\"\r\n\r\n\"In all other things, both societies, or both organisms of the same\r\nsociety, co-exist, and display their activity jointly, the campaign of\r\nthe Katipunan or that of the Liga being the most active; according as\r\nthe necessities with which the one or the other were preferentially\r\nencharged to satisfy the final triumph of the revolt, might be of\r\nthe greatest urgency or immediate utility.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact is that the Liga and the Katipunan were the distinct\r\nfoundations of two personal enemies, both of whom wished to hold for\r\nhimself the position of supreme chief of the movement. (See note 70).\r\n\r\nD. Manuel Luengo, Civil Governor of Manila, in a report to the Minister\r\nof Foreign affairs, speaking on the subject of the Katipunan, says:\r\n\r\n\"To carry to a head their fearful and criminal idea, they found it\r\nnecessary to recruit many people of all classes and from all the\r\nprovinces, seeking a useful means to facilitate the conjuration. And\r\nthe indian being by reason of his ignorance and his barbarianism,\r\nlike all peoples of his kind, easily fanaticised, they set to work to\r\nfanaticise the masses, these hordes of childish people, these ignorant\r\nlaborers; and they fanaticised them by means of the pacto-de-sangre,\r\nmaking them swear war to the death to Spaniards, practicing an incision\r\nin the left arm, and with the blood which flowed from the wound made\r\nthem sign their frightful oath.\"\r\n\r\n\"The masonic attributes discovered, and the \"apron\" [62] upon which\r\nappeared the head of a Spaniard suspended by the hair, by the hand\r\nof a criminal indian, whilst with the other hand a dagger was plunged\r\ninto the throat, evidenced, in a notorious manner, that this Society\r\nwas found well provided with masonic rites.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 72. Deodato Arellano, Bonifacio, Dina and Plata, it will be\r\nremembered, were energetic workers of the Liga. They had entered into\r\nthe scheme of Rizal's association before Pilar's idea of a similar\r\nsociety had become known. Two months or so after the foundation of\r\nthe Liga, at the time when its founder was deported to Dapitan, it\r\nwas decided to take up Pilar's project and see what could be done\r\ntowards carrying it to a successful issue.\r\n\r\nJose Dizon y Matanza (fols. 1,129-1,131) testified that \"on the\r\nsame day in which General Despujols ordered the publication in the\r\nGaceta of the deportation of Rizal, there gathered in a house in\r\ncalle Ilaya, Bonifacio, Arellano, Valentin Diaz, Teodoro Plata, Dina\r\nand the witness; and they agreed to form a society to be known as the\r\nKatipunan, the object and ends of which were to be filibusterism, or,\r\nin other words, the liberty of the country from Spanish rule; the six\r\npersons present immediately proceeded to perform upon themselves the\r\nincision of the pacto-de-sangre, signing with their own blood a blank\r\npaper, placing after the signature, the symbolic name each chose\r\nfor himself. They then drew up the programme of the Society. This\r\nprogramme was composed of 6 articles, viz.: 1st: to constitute a\r\nsecret society known as the Katipunan; 2nd: that the organization\r\nwas to be by triangles, to the end that no more than three members\r\nshould know one another; 3rd: that the initiated should pay one real\r\nentrance fee, and a half real as a monthly subscription; 4th: that\r\nas the number of the members increased they should found one or more\r\nbalangay in each district; 5th: to try to gather funds to carry out\r\nthe purposes of the society; 6th: that when the opportunity occurred\r\nthey should reform these articles.\r\n\r\nThey also agreed upon the form of oath which should be taken by the\r\ninitiated, which was to promise to shed even the last drop of blood\r\nfor the liberty of the Philippines.\r\n\r\nThe Katipunan was founded upon masonic usage adapted to the character\r\nof the association. Its formation was one of triangles, each new\r\nKatipunero being bound to attract to the association, two others to\r\noccupy the opposite angles. This formation was eventually changed on\r\naccount of the extent to which the society extended, its management\r\nbecoming very difficult. The particular triangles were broken up\r\nand the association formed in three degrees. The first degree was\r\ncomposed of the recently initiated members. These each possessed a\r\nmask and some form of arm, either fire-arm or bolo, the cost of which\r\nwas borne by the member possessing it. The members who enjoyed the\r\nsecond degree also possessed masks and wore as a regalia a ribbon\r\nto which was attached a medal bearing a letter (equivalent to K)\r\nof the old-time form of script of the pre-Spanish filipino; also a\r\nsword and banner crossed.\r\n\r\nThe third degree members possessed red masks, the color being\r\ndistinctive of the degree, in the same way as the color of the\r\nsecond degree was green, and that of first, black. These colors\r\nwere symbolic: green signified hope, and red, war. Black was but a\r\ngeneral color common to bandits all the world over. The masks of the\r\nthird degree bore a triangle with three K's in the upper part, in the\r\nancient Filipino script, and at the base the letters Z. Ll. B. (see\r\nat commencement of book). The inferior inscription signified \"sons\r\nof the people.\"\r\n\r\nEach degree had its pass words and the members only knew those of\r\ntheir own degree.\r\n\r\nThis was the latter form of the Katipunan in which it differed somewhat\r\nfrom the Liga.\r\n\r\nPilar's plan was revolutionary; Bonifacio's truly anarchistic.\r\n\r\nAmong the \"chosen people\" who testified before the Schurman Commission\r\nwere two of the three native members of the present U. S. Commission,\r\nTavera and Legarda. Both of these, among many other statements\r\nwhich will not hold water, had something to say on the subject of\r\nthe Katipunan.\r\n\r\nLegarda stated that: (see Report of the Philippine Commission, 1900;\r\nvol. II page 377.)\r\n\r\n\"This Society of Filipinos (the separatist element) united itself to\r\nthe masonic society in Spain, and they established branches here;\r\nand this masonic society which was a true masonic society with all\r\nthe characteristics of Masonry, converted itself afterwards into the\r\nKatipunan society. This society, the Katipunan, made great progress\r\nhere in the Philippines, for they had to do greatly with the common\r\npeople; they never had anything to do, or mixed at at all, with the\r\nhigher class of people here in the Philippines [63]. As a result of\r\nthis the society gained much credit and power, and undermined the\r\nforces which were in existence, especially the native regiments of\r\nTagalogs. This was in 1896; the Revolution broke out at San Juan del\r\nMonte in August. A curious fact that must be noted was that a friar,\r\nwho was the priest of Tondo, was the cause of its breaking out; for\r\nGen. Blanco knew of this movement of the people and what was going\r\non [64], and was in favor of making concessions to the people. This\r\nfriar denounced the society, for he had a very intimate friend who\r\nwas a filipino, and he caused this friend to be introduced into\r\nthe Katipunan society [65], and this friend afterwards became the\r\nleader of the revolution himself. This Filipino was named Andres\r\nBonifacio, and later on he was chief of the revolution and chief of\r\nthe Katipunan society. He took refuge in Cavite, and all that province\r\nrose up. Aguinaldo who was Municipal Captain in Cavite Viejo that\r\ntime, was also a member of the Katipunan. When he heard that the\r\nCivil Guard was going to arrest him, he revolted too. He met a man\r\nwho was his superior in the society--that is, Bonifacio--and as his\r\nambition was his moving spirit, he caused Bonifacio to be shot.\"\r\n\r\nTavera gave his opinion as follows: (see same Report, page 399. Vol\r\nII).\r\n\r\n\"The conviction was strong among the Filipinos that they would not\r\nsucceed in attaining anything by any other means than force. This\r\nbeing the case, the idea occurred to some Filipinos to found a system\r\nof masonry here. There were some lodges of the masonic order here,\r\nand the idea presented itself to form a sort of political masonry,\r\nwhich was created and called the Katipunan. This Katipunan society\r\nwas naturally a secret society and had, I think, about 400,000\r\nmembers, principally in the Tagalog provinces and of the people of\r\nthe valley of the Pasig River. I think in Manila and in the valley\r\nof the Pasig there were 80,000, naturally, as there were so many,\r\nand as they were so strong, the idea of a revolution was a natural\r\nconsequence. The principal agitator of all this movement was a\r\nman named Andres Bonifacio, who stirred up and directed it. The\r\npolitical movement in the Philippines was started, as was natural,\r\nby the aristocracy of wealth and of intelligence, but the Katipunan\r\nsociety was formed entirely of the elements from the lowest class of\r\nsociety. Bonifacio was a man without education. He was employed in\r\none of the business houses at a small salary, of perhaps $30 or $40\r\n(Mexican) a month. They went on arranging their affairs very quietly\r\nand very secretly, awaiting a proper moment for action, which they\r\nbelieved would be the time of General Blanco's departure from the\r\nPhilippines. Gen. Blanco was a man who was well thought of here\r\n[66], for he had a great deal of tolerance for the people [67]. He\r\ndid tolerate masonry, and they believed that he also tolerated the\r\nexistence of the Katipunan society. One day the priest of Tondo,\r\nPadre Gil, through the confession of a woman [68], learned of the\r\nexistence of the Katipunan society, for the woman's husband was a\r\nmember [69]. This Father Gil informed the General, so the Katipunan\r\nsociety was discovered.\r\n\r\nAs the reader can easily see for himself there is considerable\r\ndifference between the statements of these two persons; a comparison\r\nof these with the real facts of the case will show how easy it is for\r\na certain element to distort truth when it serves its purpose. I have\r\nquoted these two \"chosen\" people, not that their statements may go\r\ndown to posterity as history (which has been distorted sufficiently),\r\nbut because both Tavera and Legarda formed part of Aguinaldo's mock\r\ngovernment--the Filipino Commune; and therefore both of them had\r\nplenty of occasion to know the real facts of the case, facts they\r\nevidently desired, for some reason, to distort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 73. See notes 70 and 71.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 74. Herein the katipuneros showed their madness. So fanaticised\r\ndid they become that nothing of a nature or character Spanish was\r\nallowed to remain. They carried this anti-Espanolism to the utmost\r\nextreme. Those of the native clergy who sympathised with the Katipunan\r\nfrequently tore down the images of the saints in the churches, merely\r\nbecause the said saints were Spanish or painted them black in order\r\nto work the easier upon the imagination of the people.\r\n\r\nIt was this hatred for things Spanish that gave rise to the bitterness\r\ndemonstrated against the Religious Orders. The friar was a Spaniard,\r\nthe most Spanish, as a general rule, of all the Spaniards in the\r\nArchipelago, and as such became the principal target.\r\n\r\n(See page 148).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 75. The revolution ever showed unmistakable signs of a bitter race\r\nhatred. When the revolt first broke forth this race hatred was confined\r\nto Spaniards; and it was not until the breaking out of the insurrection\r\nagainst the lawful authority of the U. S. that it became general. Till\r\nthen anyone but a Spaniard could go from end to end of the Archipelago\r\nwithout molestation; but when the promises of independence and other\r\nthings of a like nature, made by the American Consuls of Hong-Kong and\r\nSingapore, and other irresponsible persons, failed to materialize, the\r\nself-asserted leaders of the people lost confidence in the white man\r\nand race hatred commenced to include all white people. When Aguinaldo's\r\nhordes of semi-savages commenced their attack upon the American forces,\r\nthe effects of this race-hatred were felt more than ever before in the\r\nhistory of the country. Not only was the white man to be destroyed,\r\nbut all those who sympathised with him--the Filipinos determined to\r\n\"stagger humanity.\" And how they were going to do it is demonstrated\r\nin a document signed by Aguinaldo, captured by the American forces and\r\npublished by the War Department of the U. S. on the 5th of September\r\n1900. The following are a few extracts from it:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Malolos, Jan. 9, 1899--Instructions to the Brave Soldiers of\r\n    Sandtahan of Manila.\r\n\r\n    \"Article 1. All Filipinos should observe our fellow-countrymen\r\n    in order to see whether they are American sympathizers. They\r\n    shall take care to work with them in order to inspire them\r\n    with confidence of the strength of the holy cause of their\r\n    country. Whenever they are assured of the loyalty of the converts\r\n    they shall instruct them to continue in the character of an\r\n    American sympathizer in order that they may receive good pay,\r\n    but without prejudicing the cause of our country. In this way\r\n    they can serve themselves, and at the same time serve the public\r\n    by communicating to the committee of chiefs, and of our army,\r\n    whatever news of importance they may have [70].\r\n\r\n\r\n    GIFTS AS COVERS FOR ATTACK.\r\n\r\n    \"Art. 2. All of the chiefs and Filipino brothers should be ready\r\n    and courageous for the combat, and should take advantage of the\r\n    opportunity to study well the situation of the American outposts\r\n    and headquarters, observing especially secret places where they\r\n    can approach and surprise the enemy.\r\n\r\n    \"Art. 3. The chief of those who go to attack the barracks should\r\n    send in first, four men with a good present for the American\r\n    commander. Immediately after will follow four others, who will\r\n    make a pretense of looking for the same officer for some reason\r\n    and a larger group shall be concealed in the corners or houses in\r\n    order to aid the other groups at the first signal. This wherever\r\n    it is possible at the moment of attack.\r\n\r\n\r\n    TO MURDER IN WOMAN'S DISGUISE.\r\n\r\n    \"Art. 4. They should not, prior to the attack, look at the\r\n    Americans in a threatening manner. On the contrary, the attack\r\n    on the barracks by the Sandtahan should be a complete surprise\r\n    and with decision and courage. One should go alone in advance\r\n    in order to kill the sentinel. In order to deceive the sentinel\r\n    this one should dress as a woman, and must take great care that\r\n    the sentinel is not able to discharge his piece, thus calling\r\n    the attention of those in the barracks. This will enable his\r\n    companions who are approaching to assist in the general attack.\r\n\r\n    \"Art. 5. At the moment of the attack the Sandtahan should not\r\n    attempt to secure rifles from their dead enemies, but shall pursue,\r\n    slashing right and left with bolos until the Americans surrender,\r\n    and after there remains no enemy who can injure, they may take\r\n    the rifles in one hand and the ammunition in the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FIREBRANDS FROM THE HOUSETOPS\r\n\r\n    \"Art. 6.

At the same time in\r\n    the lower parts of the houses will be concealed the Sandtahan,\r\n    who will attack immediately.\r\n\r\n    \"Great care should be taken not to throw glass in the streets, as\r\n    the greater part of our soldiers go barefooted. On these houses\r\n    there will, if possible, be arranged in addition to the objects\r\n    to be thrown down, a number of the Sandtahan, in order to cover\r\n    a retreat or to follow up a rout of the enemy's column, so that\r\n    we may be sure of the destruction of all the opposing forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WOMEN TO PREPARE \"BOMBS\"\r\n\r\n    \"Art. 9.

In these houses shall\r\n    be the Sandtahan, who shall hurl the liquids that shall be passed\r\n    to them by women and children.\r\n\r\n    \"Art. 10. In place of bolos or daggers if they do not possess\r\n    the same, the Sandtahan can provide themselves with lances and\r\n    arrows with long sharp heads, and these should be shot with great\r\n    force in order that they may penetrate well into the bodies of\r\n    the enemy.

No\r\nparticular hatred was shown to any class; it was all Spaniards of\r\nall classes and conditions who were to be assassinated. It is also\r\nclearly depicted in the Act of Session of the Katipunan Sur already\r\nquoted (See page 81; also foot-note page 80).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 76. What Sr. Diaz intends by Tagalog Katipunan is not quite\r\nclear. The whole society was practically confined to the Tagalog\r\nprovinces and was insignificant in extent even beyond the city of\r\nManila and its suburbs. There was no other Katipunan.\r\n\r\nIn November 1895 the assembly of the Katipunan was composed of\r\nten individuals of the Supreme Council, and the presidents of the\r\npopular sections who were entitled to assist in virtue of holding\r\nsome office therein.\r\n\r\nIn January of the following year of 1896, after the annual election,\r\nthe assembly was composed as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n            President           Andres Bonifacio.\r\n            Secretary           Emilio Jacinto.\r\n                             /  Vicente Molina.\r\n            Treasurer        +  Pantaleon Torres.\r\n                             \\  Hermenegildo Reyes.\r\n                             /  Francisco Carreon.\r\n                             |  Jose Trinidad.\r\n            Councillors      +  Balbino Florentino.\r\n                             \\  Aguedo del Rosario.\r\n            Fiscal              Pio Valenzuela.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 77. The question of the amount and the source of the supply of\r\narms possessed by the Katipunan has always been one of dispute. Some\r\nsuppose the rebels to have been well armed, whilst others reckon the\r\nnumber of serviceable guns to have been very small.\r\n\r\nAmong the papers and documents belonging to the Katipunan Sur, seized\r\nby the Spanish authorities, is the following:\r\n\r\n\"Commissioned for the purchase of arms:\r\n\r\n\r\n            D. Gabino    \\\r\n            D. Juan      + Tantoko\r\n            D. Antonio   |\r\n            D. Ezequiel  /\r\n            D. Epifanio Ramos.\r\n            D. Victoriano Luis\r\n                 for the distinct armories of Manila.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a letter of the Secretary to the President D. Agustin Tantoko\r\n(a native priest; see page 79):\r\n\r\n\"I believe we can obtain the dynamite by bribing some of the harbor\r\nemployees.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter has a foot-note which says: \"When you have read this,\r\ndestroy it.\"\r\n\r\nNumeriano Adriano testified (fols. 1,309-1,312) that Andres Bonifacio\r\nhad collected 10,000 pesos for the purchase, in Japan, of 4,000 rifles\r\nwith abundant ammunition.\r\n\r\nHe also stated that the arms had been purchased and were to be landed\r\nnear by the mountains of San Mateo and in the Batanes islands, from\r\nwhence they would be brought to Manila.\r\n\r\nThat \"Andres Bonifacio went to San Mateo with men to receive and\r\narrange arms, whilst Deodato Arellano and Timoteo Paez were encharged\r\nto send people to Batanes to the same end.\"\r\n\r\nAlso that \"It is said that many of the insurgents in the province of\r\nCavite bear arms of different systems, and he supposed that they must\r\nhave been acquired by the rich and wealthy persons of that province,\r\nsuch as Francisco Osario and others, who knowing perhaps of the\r\nexistence of the Liga of Manila, its form and object, had formed\r\ntheir own also, in the said province, in order to unite to that of\r\nManila and make common cause therewith.\"\r\n\r\nDomingo Franco declared (fols. 1,381-1,382), in answer to a question\r\nduring his trial, as to what he knew in reference to the purchase of\r\narms and ammunition, that \"all he knew was that arms and ammunition\r\nhad been purchased, because at the end of 1895, or the beginning\r\nof 1896, he saw Francisco L. Rojas in his office in Calle Jolo, and\r\nthe said Rojas told him that he had received a quantity of arms and\r\nammunition.\" He stated moreover, that he did not know the make or\r\nnumber, nor where they had been landed.\r\n\r\nTomas Prieto of Nueva Caceres mentioned the receipt of 50 arms from\r\nBato. He also stated that Mariano Melgarejo, according to references\r\nfrom Macario Valentin, received a load of arms in eleven cases from\r\nPasacao.\"\r\n\r\nPio Valenzuela affirmed that the arms borne by the rebels were for\r\nthe most part domestic bolos [71] and lances, and that the chiefs\r\nwere armed with revolvers.\" These revolvers were, he affirmed,\r\nacquired from the Maestranzi de Artilleria.\r\n\r\nJuan Castaneda declared that \"the Japanese offered to land here 100,000\r\nrifles with their ammunition, the expense of which should be paid in\r\na fixed number of years.\"\r\n\r\nNumeriano Adriano also affirmed that it had been decided to purchase\r\narms in Japan and that one of the islands of the Archipelago should\r\nbe given to Japan in exchange for its aid.\r\n\r\nDomingo Abella affirmed that he had visited Francisco Rojas in his\r\noffice for the purpose of finding out if the arms which the tailor\r\nLuis Villareal had ordered for the society, had arrived; and that\r\nalthough Francisco Rojas did not belong to the society, he was\r\nencharged to portion out the arms and commissioned to bring them to\r\nManila. Francisco told him that he could not provide him with any as\r\nthey were all sold.\r\n\r\nThe net cost of the arms and ammunition necessary to carry out\r\nthe revolt was considerable, and as their introduction into the\r\ncountry would have to be very carefully planned, and be carried out\r\nwith the greatest secrecy, the original cost would be considerably\r\nincreased. Large sums of money were therefore necessary to cover\r\nexpenses. Although the entrance fees and monthly subscriptions were\r\nconsiderable they could not produce the amount necessary to provide\r\nfor the revolution, especially when there existed such a wide spread\r\ntendency among those who handled the funds, to absorb them as a sponge\r\nabsorbs water. Castillo in his work concerning this association and\r\nits funds says [72]:\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly it (the Katipunan) possessed large sums of money,\r\nonly the most insignificant part of which, according to report, was\r\ndiscovered in the possession of Pio Valenzuela, preserved in gold and\r\namounting, we believe, to less than 30,000 pesos. These resources\r\ncould not cover the extraordinary expenses of the propaganda, that\r\nof the Commissioners sent to Japan to treat with that power on the\r\nquestion of a protectorate, and that of the coming war expenses which\r\nwere without doubt, very considerable.\r\n\r\n\"The Indian is not so selfish or so patriotic that he would, without\r\nimmediate advantage to himself permit himself the extravagance\r\nof abandoning the sedentary life he usually leads, to launch out\r\ninto the field of adventures of doubtful result. Those who from the\r\nheadquarters of the revolution directed those torpid masses must\r\nhave realised this, and to make sure of the exit, caused money to be\r\ndistributed to all the affiliated and to their families, giving them\r\nat the same time rice in abundance.\r\n\r\n\"On the morning of the events which took place at San Juan del Monte,\r\ntwo women who live in the Santa Mesa road, were engaged in giving money\r\nto the taos [73] who passed that way, advising them to unite themselves\r\nwith the insurrectos to the end of killing all the Spaniards....\r\n................................................................\r\n\r\n\"This money set aside for distribution in San Juan del Monte, in\r\nPasig and in the pueblos on the banks of the river, must have come\r\nfrom a well stocked treasury......................................\r\n..................................................................\"\r\n\r\nA little further on, the author gives a very broad hint as to one\r\nprobable source of funds when he asks the question, where is the\r\nmillion and a half pesos which constitute the default in the public\r\ntreasury of Manila?\r\n\r\n\"It would be a curious coincidence,\" says the author, \"if part of\r\nthis amount perhaps the greater part should have served as funds from\r\nwhich the expenses of the revolution and the war were paid.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 78. The initiations into the Katipunan were grotesque in the\r\nextreme. The person introduced for initiation was placed in a room\r\ndraped in black, with its walls hung with mottoes in Tagalog dialect\r\nsuch as: \"If you have courage you may continue,\" \"If you have been\r\nbrought here by your curiosity, retire.\" Upon a table was placed a\r\nskull, a loaded revolver and a bolo. A paper upon which were written\r\nthree questions lay also upon the table. These questions were: \"In\r\nwhat state did the Spaniards find the Tagalog people at the time of\r\nthe conquest? In what state are they found now? What future can it\r\nhope for?\r\n\r\nThe initiated previously instructed by his god-father, or by the\r\nperson who catechised him, was to reply that, at the time of the\r\narrival of the Spaniards, the Filipinos living on the coasts enjoyed\r\na certain amount of civilization, since they already had cannons and\r\nsilk dresses, that they enjoyed political liberty, sustained diplomatic\r\n(sic) relations and commerce with the neighboring countries of Asia;\r\nhad their own religion and writing; in a word, lived happy with their\r\nindependence. A certain amount of civilization may be. Let us see\r\nwhat that certain amount was:\r\n\r\n\"Barely clothed, and more often naked, revelling day and night in\r\ndrunkenness, given to the practice of infanticide, holding virginity\r\nas a dishonor, having among them people who practiced defloration as a\r\nprofession, ignorant of the value and uses of money, making use of men,\r\nwomen and children to pay debts, in continual warfare with one another\r\nand enslaving their prisoners, practicing wholesale murder of slaves on\r\nthe death of a chief or important personage, adoring and sacrificing\r\nto rocks, trees, crocodiles and idols of wood; lacking religion, but\r\nhaving in its stead most bestial and absurd superstitions; without\r\ntemples, monuments or even literature, although they possessed a\r\nspecies of written language. The only human ideas they possessed were\r\nadopted from the Chinese, Japanese and Borneo Mohammedans whom they\r\nimitated after the manner of apes. This, historians tell us, was the\r\ncondition of this people 340 years ago! when the missionaries planted\r\nthe Cross on Philippine soil, and brought to the benighted natives\r\nthe gospel.\" So much for the certain amount of civilization.\r\n\r\nCannons and silk dresses: of a kind; as to the cannons, where\r\ndid they all come from? Bought from or exchanged with the Borneo\r\nmoros probably. As to these and the silk dresses, the savages of the\r\nsouth-sea islands enjoyed the use of such things and enjoyed them with\r\nbetter knowledge of how to use them! They enjoyed political liberty;\r\nlet us see what Morga the historian who speaks most glowingly of the\r\nancient civilization of the Filipino peoples, has to say on this point.\r\n\r\nHe says: \"In all these islands the people had neither kings nor lords\r\nto dominate them as in other kingdoms and provinces. But in each\r\nisland were many chiefs from among the same natives, some greater\r\nthan others each one with his subjects, by groups and families, who\r\nobeyed and respected them. Sometimes these chiefs were at peace with\r\none another and some times at war.... The superiority which these\r\nchiefs had over the people of their group was such that they held\r\nthem as subjects, with power to treat them well or ill, disposing of\r\ntheir persons, children and estates at their will, without resistance\r\nor the necessity of giving account to anyone, and for very slight\r\noffences they killed and wounded them and made slaves of them; and\r\nif it happened that one of the chiefs were bathing in the river and a\r\nnative passed in front of him or looked upon him with want of respect,\r\nand for other similar things, they made slaves of them for ever.\" This\r\nis a good and practical kind of political liberty, just the kind of\r\nliberty the country would enjoy if in the hands of the leaders of the\r\nFederal Party, so anxious for liberties for themselves and coercion\r\nfor those who do not agree with their way of thinking.\r\n\r\nDiplomatic relations and commerce with the neighboring countries of\r\nAsia: As to the diplomatic relations the mere idea of such a thing is\r\npreposterous. If we are to concede the use of diplomatic relations\r\nto the ancient Tagalog people, then we must consider as diplomatic\r\nrelations such customs as the passing of the \"peace pipe\" practiced\r\nby the indian of the United States, and the giving and accepting of\r\nyoung women for sensual convenience practiced in many of the islands\r\nof the Pacific up to the present day. As to their foreign commerce\r\nlet us listen once more to Morga. \"Their contracts and negotiations\r\nwere as a rule illicit, each one considering the best way to come\r\noff successful in his business.\"\r\n\r\nTheir own religion: For a religious system they worshiped their\r\nancestors and performed human sacrifices. The Spaniards found in\r\nthese islands less than a million inhabitants, who were divided\r\ninto innumerable tribes governed by rulers who had no more title of\r\nsovereignty than that they were enabled to impose upon the people by\r\nbrute force and untold cruelties. The inhabitants formed a jumble of\r\ninferior races some more or less pure in blood, others intermixed;\r\npeople speaking many dialects. They all lacked religion, in the proper\r\nsense of the word; they lacked morals, in fact they were wanting in\r\neverything that raises man above the level of the brute creation.\r\n\r\nAs to their own writing, certain it is that they possessed a crude and\r\nvery inefficient manner of writing, but what is very remarkable is,\r\nthat in spite of their possessing a system of script, not a single\r\npiece of their literary work has yet been discovered nor even a written\r\ntradition. This goes to prove that either the Filipinos were at that\r\ntime too deep in the savage ages to realise the importance of writing,\r\nor that the form of script was useless for practical purposes.\r\n\r\nTo the second question the initiated replied that the friar\r\nmissionaries had done nothing to civilize the Filipinos, as they\r\nconsidered the civilization and illustration of the country to be\r\nincompatible with their interests [74].\r\n\r\nTo the third question the initiated was to reply that they had\r\nfaith, courage and constancy to aid them to remedy these evils in\r\nthe future. [75]\r\n\r\nThe master of ceremonies warned him that he was taking a very important\r\nand very solemn step, and he was recommended to retire if he did not\r\nfeel courage enough to continue since he would uselessly expose his\r\nlife. If the initiated insisted in continuing with the mysteries of\r\nthe initiation he was presented to the reunion of the brethren to\r\nbe tried by the proofs assigned, which were very similar to those\r\nadopted in universal masonry, but surrounded with more paganism,\r\nif that be possible. He was blindfolded and made to discharge a\r\nrevolver against an imaginary enemy, a person he was made to believe\r\nreally was present and awaiting there the executionary bullet which\r\nshould make him pay the penalty of a treason. If he passed through\r\nthe proofs successfully he was introduced into the hall of oaths and\r\nthere with his own blood, drawn by means of an incision made in the\r\nleft arm between the shoulder and the elbow, he signed the oath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 79. See note 50, pages 171, 173 and 174.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 80. The liberty of the Tagalog people; the chief aim which gave\r\nrise to the revolt. The first thing the separatists desired was to\r\nget rid of the Peninsular Spaniard; the next to go would have been the\r\ninsular Spaniard, then the Spanish mestizo, then the Chinee half-caste\r\nand the Chinee; after which would come the gradual extinction of the\r\nvarious tribes. In the mean time the country would suffer considerably\r\nand at last...? See page 69, last four lines of the first paragraph.\r\n\r\nIt is well nigh impossible to imagine to what the liberty of the\r\nTagalog people would mean if it were put into practice. If the\r\nSouth American states which are recognized as independent, are\r\nunable to govern themselves in spite of the political superiority\r\nof the people inhabiting them over the peoples of this archipelago,\r\nwithout an unending series of revolutions, what might we expect from\r\nthe Philippines? Give the country independence with one of the native\r\n\"commissioners\" as president of the republic and how long do you\r\nsuppose it would be before Pedro Paterno at the head of some 5 or\r\n6,000 men would march into Manila to depose the president and proclaim\r\nhimself Emperor Pedro I? And before the new Emperor could install\r\nhimself in Malacanan he would have at his heels a thousand and one\r\npetty chiefs, princes, kings and perhaps even a few ambitious queens!\r\n\r\nIt is over a half a century ago since the South American Republics\r\nbecame independent, and at that time the rest of the world cared but\r\nlittle for the consequences of such a step. But this indifference of\r\nthe nations can never exist here in the Orient at the commencement\r\nof this XX Century. It would never suit the rest of the world to\r\nsee independence declared in the Philippines and especially if that\r\nindependence left the reins of government in the hands of the Tagalog\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe question of the expulsion from the country or the destruction of\r\nthe Spaniards has been spoken of under several notes; the idea was,\r\ndoubtless, a semi-savage interpretation of the preachings and teachings\r\nspread abroad by the Bible societies in all parts and especially in\r\nSpanish countries. And this becomes the more probable when we call\r\nto mind what the El Imparcial of the 26th of August 1896 published\r\nconcerning this identical point. Speaking of the state of the country\r\nin general as a result of the insurrection, it says:\r\n\r\n\"The minister of Foreign affairs received a telegram yesterday from\r\nGeneral Blanco manifesting that more arrests had been made.........\r\n...................................................................\r\n\r\nThe conjuration had ramifications in various parts of the Archipelago,\r\nand in it figured not only masonic societies but also Bible\r\nsocieties..........................................................\r\n...................................................................\r\n\r\nThe propaganda of filibusterism is encharged to the colporteurs\r\nof evangelical books, who wander all over the Archipelago selling\r\nprotestant publications.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 81. These three native priests were among the prime movers of\r\nthe rebellion of 1872, a revolt which was planned out in the houses\r\nof Joaquin Pardo de Tavera and Jacinto Zamora. The three priests were\r\nexecuted by the garrote together with Francisco Saldua. Gomez left\r\nthe sum of 200,000 pesos to his natural son, born to him before he\r\nentered the priesthood. In his will he strongly counselled his son to\r\nbe ever faithful to the Spanish authorities. I had intended to give a\r\nbrief outline of the revolt of '72 but space will not permit. Taking\r\nit as a whole, it differed little from the revolt of '96 with the\r\nexception that it was directly brought about by the propagators of\r\nrevolutionary ideas then rampant in Spain, and by the emissaries of\r\nthe revolutionary government then established.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 82.--See note 20.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 83. The oath taken by the katipuneros was as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                K. K. K.\r\n                             N. M. A. N. B.\r\n\r\n    Section....\r\n\r\n    I declare that on account of my entrance into the K. K. K. of\r\n    the A. N. B. I have sworn a solemn oath in my native pueblo and\r\n    in the presence of a superior of the Junta of the Katipunan,\r\n    to do away with everything that is possible and even with that\r\n    which is to me most near and dear and appreciated in this life,\r\n    and to defend the cause to victory or to death. And in truth of\r\n    this I swear also to be obedient in everything and to follow in\r\n    the fight wherever I am led.\r\n\r\n    And in proof of what I have said I place my true name with the\r\n    blood of my veins at the foot of this declaration.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 84. Pio Valenzuela, who gave some of the most interesting and\r\nreliable information concerning the inner life of the Katipunan,\r\ntestified (fols. 1,663-1,673) that on the 30th of November 1895,\r\nthe birthday of Bonifacio, a meeting was held in Caloocan, in\r\na house situated in the rice fields, some thirty five or forty\r\nindividuals assisting thereat, among them being the witness. This\r\nmeeting continued all day and all night till the following day, the\r\nfirst of December. At this meeting they pronounced the death sentence\r\nupon the tailor Guzman for publishing the secrets of the Katipunan;\r\nthis sentence was signed by all present including the witness, after\r\nhe had made many observations against it, observations the rest would\r\nnot listen to. One of the lighter punishments meted out was the public\r\nexposition in the lodge rooms of the picture of the person punished,\r\nwith the word traitor written over or under it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 85. The Katipunan enjoyed a peculiar and special organization,\r\nwhich was given to it in order to avoid surprises and treachery. The\r\nassemblies were always held in secluded places and under the cover\r\nof the greatest secrecy. Sometimes they were held at midnight in the\r\nopen cornfields so as not to attract the attention of those indians\r\nwho were not members of the society. Valenzuela relates how a secret\r\nmeeting was held in the pueblo of Pasig at midnight, on one occasion\r\nto arrange the matter of the annexation of the Islands to Japan in\r\ncase that nation did not care to declare a protectorate over them.\r\n\r\nThe Council of Ministers of the Supreme popular Council was as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n            President      Andres Bonifacio.\r\n            War            Teodoro Plata.\r\n\r\n            State          Emilio Jacinto.\r\n            Interior       Aguedo del Rosario.\r\n            Justice        Birecio Pantas.\r\n            Finance        Enrique Pacheco.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 86. Pio Valenzuela mentioned one occasion upon which such a\r\nmeeting of the society was held, he himself assisting thereat, in\r\nthe house of Andres Bonifacio. It was a supper given in honor of the\r\nbaptism of a child to which the said Valenzuela was god-father. After\r\nthe supper, which served as a shield under the which the work of the\r\nlodge was to be done, an election was held for the Supreme and the\r\nPopular Councils, and the sections. Some thirty members were present.\r\n\r\nAnother case he mentioned was that of a meeting held on the birthday\r\nof Bonifacio 30th of November 1895.\r\n\r\nThe Katipunan moreover had its own festivals. This is how Valenzuela\r\ndescribes them:\r\n\r\n\"The Katipunan held its festival, according as Andres Bonifacio had\r\ntold the witness, on the 7th of July, anniversary of the foundation\r\nof the society; it also celebrated another anniversary on the 28th\r\nof February, the date of the execution of the three native priests,\r\nBurgos, Gomez and Zamora (see note 81). On that day a catafalque draped\r\nwith black cloth, was erected in each one of the popular Councils,\r\nhaving four hachones [76], one in each of its four angles, adorned\r\nwith crowns made with plants named Macabuhay [77]. All the members\r\nfiled before the funeral pile, reciting prayers for the dead and\r\nswearing to avenge the death of the three priests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 87. Roman Baza, who was one of the many who suffered the death\r\npenalty for his treason, undertook to educate in ultra-democratic\r\nideas, (as Isabelo de los Reyes is doing in our days), all he came\r\nin contact with. He printed and spread abroad the \"rights of man\"\r\nof the French revolution.\r\n\r\nHe was at one time president of the Katipunan (see p. 44) but being\r\na man little suited to carry out to a successful issue the set\r\nplans of the society, Bonifacio determined to remove him, by what\r\nSr. Diaz terms a coup-d'etat, but more properly called an underhand\r\ntrick. Bonifacio, at that time treasurer, forced a conflict on the\r\nsubject of the financial conditions of the society, being denounced\r\nas an exploiter for his pains. The quarrel was settled by an election,\r\nBonifacio by his unholy influence carrying all before him.\r\n\r\nIt was during the presidency of Baza that the Katipunan society for\r\nwomen was founded, \"the object of which was mutual succor (!). The\r\ninstitution serving at the same time to dissimulate the meetings of\r\nthe male Katipuneros. Whilst the latter were holding their sessions\r\nin a retired room, the women were in the salon with some young men\r\ndancing, singing or eating. The presidentess of this society of mutual\r\nsuccorers was Mariana Dizon.\r\n\r\nTo secure admission it was necessary to be a daughter or sister of\r\none of the male members. Mariana Dizon later on married Jose Turiano\r\nSantiago, and as a result, the female Katipunan, as an organization\r\nwas broken up, the late members however continuing to shield as before,\r\nthe labors of the Katipunan reunions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 88. See notes 74, 75 and 93. Part of the local and provincial\r\nSpanish press has not failed to give the public a rehash from time to\r\ntime, of the greater part of the inventions of the separatists. It is\r\nneedless to say, however, that in this it has failed to receive the\r\nsupport of representative Spaniards who look upon such an action as\r\nlittle to the honor of the good name of Spain. As to the corresponding\r\nEnglish-speaking press in this connection, the less said the better\r\nfor the good name of American journalism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 89. Jose Dizon Matanza stated during his trial (fols. 1,132-1,138)\r\n\"that Pio Valenzuela sought money from the wealthy, and as he (the\r\nprisoner) understood, from a statement of Bonifacio, had collected\r\nover a thousand pesos for the object of covering the expenses of the\r\ntrip which he made to Dapitan to confer with Rizal; and in order to\r\nfool the authorities he took with him a blind individual with his\r\nguide, that Rizal might perform a cure or some operation upon the\r\nblind man. The motive of the conference was the proposition to Rizal\r\nof the armed rebellion, etc., etc.\"\r\n\r\nValenzuela himself spoke of this trip to Dapitan (see note 16, p. 133)\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n\"In the month of May of that year 1896, a reunion was held in\r\nPasig and there it was agreed to send a commission to Japan ... and\r\nit was agreed also to commence the armed rebellion, settling the\r\nmanner in which it should be carried out, but it was decided that,\r\nprevious to taking action it would be wise to consult with Rizal,\r\nthe witness being chosen as emissary. The schoolmaster of Cavite\r\nViejo, by name Santos, proposed that a blind man named Raymundo Mata\r\nshould accompany Valenzuela that Rizal might cure him. The witness\r\nembarked on the S. S. Venus at the end of May, meeting on board,\r\none of Rizal's sisters, and his (Rizal's) querida, an American or\r\nEnglish woman named Josefina; and arriving at Dapitan, the witness\r\nwent ashore with the two women and a servant that accompanied them,\r\nmaking their way to the house of Rizal, etc., etc.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to a statement of Isabelo de los Reyes, \"Rizal, as has\r\nbeen clearly proved at the trials (of traitors) advised them to wait\r\nanother two years, as they lacked arms.\"\r\n\r\nI wonder if Rizal foresaw the war to break out two years later between\r\nSpain and the United States! His intense desire to go to Cuba would\r\ngive one that idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 90. Negotiations indeed! Who can imagine the circumspect and\r\nformal little nation of Japan admitting negotiations with a warehouse\r\nporter, a man who was representative only of the worst of the lowest\r\nclasses! Sr. Diaz probably made this statement from hearsay por boca de\r\nganso as they say in Spanish. If any negotiations took place between\r\nBonifacio and the Japanese Government they were on a par with those\r\nbetween the late U. S. Consuls of Singapore and Hong-Kong, and a few\r\nother irresponsible people, and Aguinaldo, the leader of the Katipunan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 91. As has been seen in the foregoing notes, it was the\r\nintention of the separatists to make purchases of arms and their\r\nnecessary ammunition in Japan. Those wealthy Filipinos who were\r\nowners of steamships were looked to as the chief assistance in the\r\ntransportation and landing of the said arms, etc.\r\n\r\nThe date of the arrival of the arms, according as appeared from\r\nevidence given during the trial of Francisco L. Roxas, was to have\r\nbeen the 31st of December 1896. Lorenzo de la Paz, however, stated\r\nthat it was the 1st of September of the said year. Others claimed\r\nit to be the 13th of September or the 30th of November. As may be\r\neasily seen, there was no lack of disagreement among the chiefs\r\nof the revolt, and perhaps, as far as the majority were concerned,\r\nstill more exploitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 92. Pio Valenzuela y Alejandrino was a licentiate of Medicine,\r\nand one of the members of the inferior Supreme Council of the\r\nKatipunan. According to his own story he entered the files of the\r\nsociety under compulsion at the hands of Andres Bonifacio, who on\r\nthe strength of a love affair, gave him the alternative of death or\r\nmembership in the Katipunan (see p. 132). In his declaration during\r\nhis trial (fol. 142-147) on the 6th of September 1896, he recorded\r\nhow on the 30 day of November, S. Andrew's day of the year 1895,\r\nhe was presented by Andres Bonifacio to various Katipuneros as\r\n\"brother\" Medico (Doctor), Bonifacio stating that from that time he\r\n(Valenzuela) would be the doctor of the society. He also stated how,\r\nin the following month of January and in another meeting, he was\r\nnominated Fiscal, and official doctor with a salary of thirty pesos\r\nmonthly, a salary he had no little difficulty in collecting. He was\r\ncommissioned in May 1896 to go to Dapitan to hold a conference with\r\nRizal concerning armed rising against the supreme authority of Spain\r\nin the Archipelago; but Rizal was shrewder and more far-sighted than\r\nthe others and would not consent to the carrying out of the scheme as\r\nproposed by Bonifacio. On the return of Valenzuela Bonifacio imposed\r\nupon him a strict silence concerning the outcome of the conference;\r\nbut being pressed by certain members of the society, among whom were\r\nEmilio Jacinto, Secretary of the Supreme Council, and capita Ramon\r\nof Pandacan, he revealed the secret of Rizal's opposition to a plan\r\nhe feared would be abortive. When once the cat was out of the bag the\r\nfacts soon became public among the principal members, with the result\r\nthat many who had promised funds for the purchase of arms etc. in\r\nJapan, refused to pay the amounts promised. Among these was a colonel\r\nof Malabon who had promised 500 pesos for the said object. This breach\r\nof confidence on the part of Valenzuela brought about the separation\r\nof himself and Bonifacio, and the former presented his resignation\r\nas doctor and fiscal of the society. Bonifacio opposed the idea of\r\nhis resignation but it was finally accepted, and the former friends\r\nparted company each to work in his own sphere.\r\n\r\nValenzuela was in fact one of the chief movers of the rebellion;\r\nthis was confessed by Domingo Franco, the late president of the then\r\ndefunct Liga Filipina. \"The rebellion,\" says he, \"was produced by a\r\nfoolish child, whose name it would dirty the tongue to pronounce,\r\nbecause after being the author of all (this however is somewhat\r\ninexact) has given himself up to the authorities to denounce those\r\nhe has succeeded in misleading.\"\r\n\r\nDuring his trial in the Bilibid prison, before Col. Francisco Olive\r\ny Garcia on the 2nd of September 1896, he gave some of the most\r\ninteresting and reliable information that has yet been gathered\r\nconcerning the interior workings and doings of the Katipunan.\r\n\r\nWhen the Guardia Civil set out from Manila to break up Bonifacio's\r\nparty in Caloocan, several of those forming the leadership fled,\r\nand among them Valenzuela. He entered Manila by way of Sampaloc,\r\npassing through Quiapo to the Escolta and down the Pasaje de Perez,\r\nembarking there on one of the lake steamers. On arrival at Binang he\r\nwent to the house of the co-adjutor D. Silvino Manaol (native priest),\r\nto whom he recounted what had taken place. The co-adjutor asked of\r\nthe parish priest the proclamation of the Governor General conceding\r\npardon to those who should present themselves [78]. Having read it\r\nwith care and under the advice of the co-adjutor, he set out for the\r\ncapital disembarking at the Ayala bridge from whence he took a quiles\r\nand went immediately to the palace of the Governor to present himself\r\nto him. The Governor General was not at home so Valenzuela at once\r\nstarted for the offices of the Military Government.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of this giving up of himself of Valenzuela, Sr. Jose\r\nM. del Castillo y Jimenez says: \"The forty-eight hours conceded by\r\nthe proclamation of the Governor Blanco were about to close when\r\nthere reached the palace of Sta. Potenciana, worn out, bathed in\r\nperspiration, and almost in a period of agony, Pio Valenzuela, an\r\nimportant person of revolution he being in such a condition that it\r\nwas necessary to assist him previous to his passing into the presence\r\nof Gov. Blanco. When he had come to himself and was in a condition\r\nto make an explicit and ample confession he had two hours conference\r\nwith the Governor, giving information of as such as he knew.\"\r\n...................................................................\r\n\r\n\"Valenzuela and Rosario were of great utility in clarifying the facts\r\nand especially in the explanation of the cipher documents discovered\r\nin the house of Villaruel and others.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader's attention is called to paragraph 3 on the following page\r\nof the text (p. 47).\r\n\r\nApart from the Councils spoken of in this and the former paragraphs\r\nthere were others formed at a later date. These were more properly\r\nvariations and were as follows:\r\n\r\nTrozo: Popular Council Maypagasa with four sections, Dapitan,\r\nSilanganan, Dimasagaran, and Dimas-Alang.\r\n\r\nPalomar: Popular Council Pinkian with two sections.\r\n\r\nTondo: Council Katagalugan with the sections Katutuhanan, Kabuhayan,\r\nPagtibayan, Kalingaan and Bagong-sinag under the presidency of\r\nAlejandro Santiago, Braulio Rivera, Hilarion Cruz, Cipriano Pacheco,\r\nNicolas Rivera and Deogracias Fajardo.\r\n\r\nConception and Dilao (Paco): the Council Mahaganti presided over by\r\nRafael Gutierrez; and the sections Panday and Ilog, with a delegation\r\nin Ermita.\r\n\r\nIn Cavite was the popular Council Kawit the president of which\r\nwas Emilio Aguinaldo [79] the capitan municipal of the pueblo of\r\nCavite Viejo and later on the dictator of the Filipino Commune. This\r\nCouncil comprehended Imus, Noveleta, Silang, Naic, Maragondon and\r\nother pueblos. Imus was presided over by Juan Castaneda, Noveleta by\r\nAlejandro Crisostomo.\r\n\r\nIn Bacoor was a Popular Council presided over by Genaro Valdes with\r\nthree sections Dimagpatantan (not to leave in peace), Ditutugutan (not\r\nto rest till the end is reached), and Pananginginigan (formidable).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 93. The Kalayaan was intended to be a monthly review. Its\r\nfirst number consisted of thirty-two pages in quarto. The price\r\nof each number was 50c (Mexican). It was a most rabid anti-Spanish\r\npublication and advocated separatism openly, and yet in spite of the\r\npress censorship it circulated freely in the Archipelago.\r\n\r\nAs the common belief was that this paper was published in Japan, as\r\nwould appear from the paper itself, General Blanco decided to send a\r\nspecial delegate to Japan to investigate the matter of its impression,\r\nits publishers, authors, etc., that steps might be taken to put a\r\nstop to its impression or at least that a check be put on its entry\r\nand circulation into the Philippines. Don Alfredo Villeta was chosen;\r\nbut on account of some hitch in the arrangements, he never started on\r\nhis errand. Some say that the paper did not reach its second number,\r\nbut it is certain that it did not reach its third.\r\n\r\nThe heading was as under:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                KALAYAAN\r\n                    Issued at the end of each month.\r\n  1st year.

No. 1.\r\n\r\n  Price of subscription,  Articles must be signed  If purchased will cost\r\n  3 months 1 peso;        by their authors.        2 reales per number.\r\n  in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe headings of the principal articles were as follows:\r\n\r\nTo the Compatriots.\r\n\r\nManifesto; by Dimas-Alang (Jose Rizal.)\r\n\r\nWhat the indian ought to know and understand; by Agapito Bagumbayan.\r\n\r\nThis latter article is a mirror in which the purpose of the paper is\r\nreflected; it reads remarkably like a composition of Pedro Paterno,\r\nthe visionary who claims for the peoples of the Archipelago a glorious\r\npre-Spanish history and civilization. The following citations from\r\nthe article will give some idea of the whole publication.\r\n\r\n\"In these islands, which were previously cared for by our true\r\nneighbors of Malaysia at a time when the Spaniards had not as yet set\r\nfoot upon the land, there existed a complete abundance and a state of\r\nwelfare. Our friends the neighboring kingdoms, and especially Japan,\r\nbrought commerce to our shores which formed the most abundant market,\r\nand there was found everything necessary, wherefore it was the richest\r\ncountry and its customs were all very good [80]. Everyone, youths and\r\nadvanced in years and even the women, could read and write according\r\nto our manner of script.\"\r\n\r\nThe article goes on to say that upon the arrival of the Spaniards the\r\nnatives only made friends with them after that Legazpi had performed\r\nthe ceremonies of the pacto-de-Sangre [81] with one of the indio\r\npetty sovereigns.\r\n\r\n\"The Spaniards,\" says the writer, \"have perverted us with their bad\r\ncustoms and have destroyed and obliged us to forget the noble and\r\nbeautiful customs of our country.\"\r\n\r\nNoble and beautiful customs: Compulsory defloration of young girls,\r\nas a result of the belief that a girl who died a virgin could not\r\nenter heaven! Could anything be more noble and beautiful?\r\n\r\nKalayaan purported to be and was always considered as the soul of\r\nthe defunct Solidaridad (see note 24). It was printed in the Tagalog\r\ndialect and died, as it was born and had lived--in shame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 94. Pio Valenzuela testified (fols. 582-591) that on the 22nd\r\nof August he was informed by Josefa Dizon that her son Jose together\r\nwith Bonifacio had fled from Manila. Valenzuela thereupon fled also,\r\nfollowing them, and reaching Caloocan about 8 p. m. There he found\r\nBonifacio with some twenty others. Andres informed them that they\r\nmust not separate as it was now time to commence the armed rebellion,\r\nthe plot of the Katipunan having been discovered. From Caloocan they\r\nwent to Balintauac arriving about 11 p. m. Here they met a certain\r\nLaong with a group of men. They remained in the pueblo Sunday,\r\nMonday and Tuesday preparing for the onslaught they were to make\r\nupon the Spaniards, which was fixed for the 29th of the same month,\r\nthe plans being that they should advance in groups upon Manila,\r\nkilling the Spaniards and also the indians and Chinese who refused\r\nto follow them, \"dedicating themselves to the sacking of the city,\r\nrobbery and incendiarism and to the violation of women.\" Many Chinese\r\nwere murdered and their stores robbed.\r\n\r\nWhilst in the fields of Balintauac distribution was made of bolos and\r\nten revolvers, the latter stolen from the Maestranza of Manila. On\r\nTuesday evening preparations were made to meet the attack of the\r\nSpanish troops which had been sent out in persecution of the rebels,\r\nand the first conflict took place. Valenzuela also stated that the\r\ngreater part of the people who formed the rebel forces were drawn,\r\ncatechised and initiated all in a moment by the fanatic Laong, who\r\nwas practically the active chief of the revolt, and who directed in\r\nperson the attack upon the Chinese stores.\r\n\r\nAbout 5 pm. on the 29th five hundred men under a \"leader of Pasig\"\r\nappeared on the scene at the waterworks. They at once took possession\r\nof the building and of the persons of the workmen. Their first\r\nintention was to stop the machinery so that no one need be left\r\nin charge thereof when orders should be received for a start for\r\nManila. The engineer however, reminded the chief that if such a thing\r\nwas done their brethren in Manila would die of thirst. This excuse\r\ncarried the day and the chief decided to leave some workmen there under\r\nthe condition that the engineer and others who wore moustaches should\r\nshave, and that all should dress like indians, and that the engineer's\r\nwife should dress like a native woman and prepare food for his men. The\r\nparty finally set out on their way. They tried to avoid an encounter\r\nwith the troops composed of artillery and infantry, 65 men in all,\r\nstationed at the powder works. In avoiding this handful of defenders\r\nthey fell afoul of other troops which gave them a good sharp reception.\r\n\r\nAs to those who, repenting, desired to return to a legal status, it\r\nis difficult to form an opinion, on account of the contrary evidence\r\nadduced in connection therewith. Isabelo de los Reyes already cited,\r\nin a futile attempt to justify the acts of the Katipuneros, claims\r\nthat some of the chiefs opposed the plan of the armed resistance as\r\ncontained in the propositions of Bonifacio, claiming that it would\r\nbe a great and useless sacrifice, to say nothing of the imprudence of\r\nsuch an act, to launch forth against an armed force without possessing\r\nbetter arms than a few bolos and lances. He claims that Bonifacio\r\nlistened to the advice and was on the point of acting upon it, but\r\nwas compelled to take the step he did in declaring the revolt, by\r\nthe attitude of his 500 followers. The authority for this statement\r\nwas Pedro Nicodemus, who was the commander of the said group, a man\r\nwho was as ignorant as he was blood-thirsty.\r\n\r\nFurther on Isabelo states that \"in the famous reunion of Balintauac,\r\nin the solemn moment of the breaking forth of the revolt (August,\r\n26th 1896) Andres Bonifacio as president of the Supreme Council of the\r\nKatipunan, explained that the plot had been discovered, and that in\r\norder to save those who were compromised and who had not up to that\r\ntime been arrested, it was necessary to launch forth to the fight,\r\nalthough the arms with which they should fight had not yet arrived\r\nfrom Japan.\"\r\n\r\nGranted however the character of Bonifacio, his aims and the methods\r\nhe adopted to carry out his ideas, such an excuse as that of Reyes\r\nargue but little in pro of the good judgement or better said the good\r\nfaith of its author. Bonifacio was anxious for the first blow of the\r\nrevolt to be struck that he might not lose the confidence of those\r\nwho had intrusted him with the undertaking and who had been fooled\r\ninto the idea that the Katipunan forces were so powerful that nothing\r\ncould resist their onward course once they had been started on their\r\nway. And to suppose that Bonifacio was to be so easily influenced by\r\na few petty chiefs is to show a complete ignorance of the character\r\nof the hero of the Katipunan. If the opposition of the said petty\r\nchiefs really occurred it was probably inspired more by fear of\r\nthe consequences than by the true spirit of repentance, for if the\r\ncruelties and abuses said to have been committed by the Spaniards\r\nwere the cause of the revolt, what need was there of such a repentance?\r\n\r\nThe prestige enjoyed by Bonifacio among the katipuneros was natural\r\nenough, in as much as he was the father of the Katipunan, the\r\nillegitimate offspring of filipino freemasonry, itself a legitimate\r\nchild of the Spanish family of universal freemasonry.\r\n\r\n\"The Katipunan,\" says the author of an exposition to Congress, dated\r\n1900 and published at the printing office of the El Liberal, \"the\r\nworthy and legitimate [82] child of Andres Bonifacio, was founded in\r\nhis own house in calle Sagunto (Tondo) between six and seven in the\r\nevening of the 7th of July 1892. Andres Bonifacio gathered together\r\nhis best friends, Teodoro Plata, Valentin Diaz, Ladislao Dina,\r\nDeodato Arellano, and Ildefonso Laurel, to whom he proposed the\r\nnecessity of the creation of that Superior Association of the Sons\r\nof the People, whose only aim should be that of the independence\r\nof the people under a Spanish protectorate or in default of that,\r\nof Japan. Those assembled took to the idea with great enthusiasm and\r\nat once commenced the propaganda of the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 95. One thing which clearly demonstrates the state of fanaticism\r\nand moral degradation to which the Katipunan fell, was the savage\r\nmanner in which they treated the Religious prisoners who fell into\r\ntheir hands. Disrespect for all authority and especially that of\r\nthe clergy, was one of the chief fruits of the work of propaganda\r\ncarried on by Rizal and other of the separatist element, aided and\r\nabetted by the Bible societies who gave moral as well as practical\r\nassistance to their labors.\r\n\r\nAs fanaticism increased, this want of respect became more intense\r\nand eventually led to a thirst for the blood of those whose greatest\r\ncrime was the excessive favor they had extended to the indian, to\r\nwhom such a thing as gratitude was unknown [83].\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the intention of the Katipuneros was the annihilation\r\nof the Spaniards, irrespective of class or condition. The parish\r\npriest being the strongest support of the administration was the\r\ntarget for the bitterest treatment at the hands of the rebels.\r\n\r\nAmong the number of those parish priests murdered by the Tagalog\r\nrebels were P. Toribio Moreno; Recolet, parish priest of Silang;\r\nP. Toribio Mateo, Recolet and parish priest of Perez Dasmarinas; and\r\nthe lay brothers: fray Luis Garbayo and Julian Umbon, these latter were\r\nmurdered in San Francisco de Malabon. Upon the Estate of Imus, then\r\nproperty of the Recolet Corporation, now in the possession of a large\r\nLondon Syndicate, were most brutally murdered the following Recolets:\r\n\r\nP. Jose Ma. Learte, ex-Provincial and parish priest of Imus, P. Simeon\r\nMarin, ex-Definitor and parish priest of Maragondon, P. Agipito\r\nEchegoyen, parish priest of Amadeo, P. Faustino Lizasoain, parish\r\npriest of Bailen, and the lay-brothers:\r\n\r\nRoman Caballero, Jorge Zueco del Rosario, Damaso Goni, Bernardo Angos,\r\nVictoriano Lopez.\r\n\r\nIt is affirmed by eye-witnesses that these victims to Tagalog\r\nfanaticism were saturated with petroleum and burned alive.\r\n\r\nFear was entertained for the safety of of several Dominican Fathers\r\nwho held parishes near by, and therefore P. Buenaventura Campa,\r\nP. Francisco Cabenas and fray Natalio Esparza immediately set\r\nout in search for them. Regardless of the great risk they ran in\r\nfalling into the hands of the bloodthirsty Katipuneros, these three\r\nheroic Dominicans casting aside all thought for self and all care\r\nfor their own welfare [84] set out for Naic in the steam launch\r\nMariposa. Difficulties were encountered from the start. The native\r\ncaptain and engineer conspired to prevent the carrying out of the\r\nattempted rescue. P. Buenaventura calling up the refractory captain\r\ntold him that he and his companions were firm in their purpose and\r\nthat progress must be made. The captain pleaded inability for want of\r\ncoal. Then hoist the sails, said P. Campa. There are none replied the\r\ncaptain. Then take my habit and those of my companions and make sails\r\nof them, thundered the Padre. The captain gave in and the journey was\r\ncontinued. Naic was reached; they failed to find their companions but\r\nwere in time to save the unfortunate wife and children of Lieut. Perez\r\nHerrero; they discovered them barefooted and wellnigh mad with terror,\r\ndressed in native clothes and hidden in a nipa shack. P. Galo Minguez,\r\nparish priest of Naic, Padres Nicolas Pena and Jose Digne and the\r\nlaybrothers Saturnino Garcia and Jose Pedida had succeeded in escaping\r\nfrom the clutches of the rebellious Tagalogs, having fled to Labay\r\nfrom whence they made their way to Corregidor, meeting there those\r\nwho had come to seek them in the Mariposa.\r\n\r\nThe Augustinian Father P. Piernavieja was another victim to\r\nfanaticism. This Father has been termed medio loco [85] and in\r\nall truth he was so if the possession of a presence of mind such\r\nas that shown by P. Piernavieja is to be termed craziness. True\r\nit is that he was at times gifted with a strange turn of mind. He\r\nhad, during the many years he administered the parish, established\r\ntherein a christian communism. When the revolt broke out he was\r\nheld as a prisoner and obliged to invest himself with the authority\r\nof an Archbishop. Had the revolt prospered and P. Piernavieja lived,\r\nundoubtedly he would have been made Archbishop of Manila by the Tagalog\r\ndiscontents. P. Piernavieja was shrewd enough to take well to his new\r\noffice. He was once called upon to anoint the chiefs and rulers, as the\r\nkings and emperors of olden time were anointed by the Church. Padre\r\nPiernavieja told them that olive oil was not suitable for such a\r\npurpose and therefore proceeded to anoint them with cocoanut oil such\r\nas is used by the natives for their lamps! Under pretext of his office\r\nof Bishop this strange old man claimed liberty to make his pastoral\r\nvisits and when he succeeded in securing this liberty which was readily\r\ngranted to him, he overran all that part of the province in the hands\r\nof the insurgents, secretly collecting all kinds of information, which\r\nhe immediately sent his superiors in Manila. This information reached\r\nthe military authorities and would have become of utility to them for\r\nthe carrying out of the campaign had it been prosecuted as a military\r\ncampaign should have been. But the Padre's messenger was eventually\r\ncaptured with messages in his possession. When questioned as to the\r\nsource of the information, and where he was taking it, he told all,\r\nand as a result Padre Piernavieja was condemned to death as a traitor\r\nto a cause to which he had never held allegiance. As a punishment he\r\nwas tied to a tree exposed to the burning rays of the tropical sun,\r\nand thus left to the mercy of the voracious birds and insects, dying\r\nof hunger, thirst and of terror in the midst of inconceivable torments.\r\n\r\nPadre David Veras, Dominican, was another of the many victims of\r\nthe Katipuneros. He was the parish priest of the pueblo of Hermosa\r\nin the province of Bataan. When the insurgents attacked the pueblo\r\nthey captured P. David, and after cutting off both his hands, dragged\r\nhim to the most distant of the ten barrios of that pueblo, and there\r\nhacked him to death with bolos and hatchets mutilating his body in\r\na horrible manner, and throwing the corpse on to a dung heap.\r\n\r\nIn the early dawn of the 25th of December 1896, in Morong province\r\nof Bataan, Padre Domingo Cabrejas, Recolet, was murdered at the altar\r\nwhile offering up the holy sacrifice of the Mass, his blood staining\r\nthe sacred linen and the steps of the altar. The katipunero murderers\r\nhurriedly hid the body in the church and fled.\r\n\r\nPadre Jose Sanjuan, also Recolet and parish priest of Bagac was\r\nanother victim. To name all those who suffered barbarous treatment at\r\nthe merciful hands of the insurgents would be a well-nigh impossible\r\ntask. Recalling the acts of those fanaticised sectarians, one might\r\nalmost recall the barbarities and brutalities of the diabolical\r\nNero. Certainly the ancient Chinese and Japanese were scarcely\r\nmore excessive in their treatment of the unfortunate missionaries\r\nthey tortured in their attempt to stamp out the christian faith;\r\nand even the Chinese boxers of our days could have taken lessons\r\nfrom the disciples of Filipino freemasonry. Many, many are the\r\nunfortunate missionaries whose blood cries to heaven for vengeance\r\nand this vengeance of the God of Justice will one day fall upon this\r\npeople. Even in our own days we cannot shut our eyes to the fact of the\r\nexistence of the well marked track of the hand of Divine Justice as it\r\npasses here and there throughout the land, calling now upon this one,\r\nnow upon that, to pay his debt even to the last farthing. The track\r\nof the finger of God has been remarkably distinct in this archipelago\r\nand many are the cases in which that finger moving slowly and silently\r\nalong has pointed out the unfruitful tree which the scythe of death\r\nshall cut down.\r\n\r\n\"For I the Lord thy God am a jealous God; visiting the sins of the\r\nfathers upon the children until the third and fourth generation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 96. Some there are who see in every event which takes place,\r\nthe protecting or avenging hand of Providence. Others there are who\r\nlaugh to scorn the idea that Providence should concern itself in\r\nsuch matters.\r\n\r\nThe hand of Providence surely has manifested itself of late in this\r\narchipelago, here protecting the one from a cruel torture, there\r\npermitting the sacrifice of a martyr to the faith or a martyr to duty\r\nand honor, and the integrity of the Spanish nation. Here giving one\r\nover to a just punishment, there pointing out another as an object\r\nfor Divine vengeance.\r\n\r\nIs proof needed perhaps that the finger of the avenging hand of Divine\r\njustice has left its well-marked path in the Philippines? Then we\r\nhave a notable case before us. A few months ago, a steamer, the Rio\r\nde Janeiro, left the Orient bound for the port of San Francisco,\r\nCal. Within sight of the city, almost within sight of the crowds\r\nwho stood upon the wharf in expectation of the ship's arrival,\r\nthe good vessel, by the will of God who rules over all things,\r\nwent to the bottom, carrying with her, among other passengers,\r\na man who was morally and physically responsible for the greater\r\npart of the barbarities practiced upon the long suffering Spanish\r\nprisoners, Religious, Civil and Military, at the hands of the Tagalog\r\nrevolutionists. With that man disappeared from the land of the living\r\nhis whole family, together with state and private papers of unknown\r\nvalue. How often before in the past history of the world has the God\r\nof Justice obliterated whole families and even whole nations!\r\n\r\nAnd who shall say that the hand of Divine Justice has not protected\r\nas well as avenged. For many months the katipuneros had woven a\r\nfine-meshed net around the Spanish population of the Philippines,\r\na labor the more easily accomplished in the same degree as the\r\nscandalous carelessness of the Blanco administration became more and\r\nmore marked. Blanco himself was a freemason [86] and was always, like\r\nour present civil administration, surrounded by friends of his own\r\nchoice, people who at no time suffered from an excess of patriotism;\r\nand the few honorable exceptions which did exist were, unfortunately,\r\npersons whose good moral influence was powerless to better a situation\r\nwhich day by day became worse [87].\r\n\r\nThis net already woven was set, and it needed but the given signal\r\nfor its string to be tightly drawn and the unsuspecting prey would\r\nimmediately fall into its folds, to be redeemed only by a barbarous,\r\ncruel death. But providence is merciful as well as just, and in her own\r\ntime opened up a way of escape for the coveted prize of the katipunero\r\nsavages. This opening was no other than Teodoro Patino, himself a\r\nmember of the diabolical society, the plot of which he was to reveal.\r\n\r\nPatino was one of the many compositors in the printing establishment of\r\nthe Diario de Manila. He was an indian of but little importance both\r\nas regards his abilities as a workman or as a katipunero: he was one\r\nof the thousands of unknowns from which have sprung so many of those\r\nsadly famous ignorantes and others of our own days. But he was destined\r\nto act an important part in the society to which he belonged: a part\r\nhowever not in the programme of proceedings drawn up by the society.\r\n\r\nA discussion took place one day as to the subscription the said\r\nPatino should pay into the common funds of the society, and heated\r\nwords passed between him and his companions on the subject. From words\r\nthey came to blows; and as Patino was one against many he came out of\r\nthe tussle second best, having received a good sound thrashing for\r\ndaring to differ from the majority. To satisfy his injured feelings\r\nhe looked around him for some one from whom he could expect sympathy,\r\nand he bethought himself of his sister who was a pupil of the College\r\nof Mandaloya, under the care of the Augustinian Nuns. To his sister\r\nhe repaired and to her he told his tale of woe, making mention at the\r\nsame time of a certain society to which he and his assailants belonged.\r\n\r\nThe sister startled by what her brother related, questioned him\r\nclosely, as only a woman can question when she wishes to get to\r\nthe bottom of anything. Having been a pupil of the Augustinian Nuns\r\nfor a considerable time and preserving in her heart sentiments of\r\ngratitude little known among the peoples of the Archipelago, she was\r\nmuch hurt to hear of the plans mapped out by the Katipunan for the\r\nbrutal destruction of those who had always been so good and kind to\r\nher and her brother. And before Patino could tell all his tale, his\r\nsister had bidden him good-bye and gone off in search of the Mother\r\nSuperior of the College, to whom she immediately told all she knew\r\nof the affair. The two women trembling with fear for the safety of\r\nthe lives of so many hundreds of innocent victims, hurriedly sought\r\nthe presence of the Rev. Padre Mariano Gil, Augustinian, and parish\r\npriest of Tondo. This Rev. Father, realizing the enormity of the\r\nKatipunan plot, advised them to send Patino to him without delay.\r\n\r\nPatino presented himself at the convento and underwent a close\r\nexamination at the hands of Padre Mariano. At first little progress\r\nwas made, as Patino feared both the anger of the authorities and\r\nthat of his fellow katipuneros, who would doubtless take revenge upon\r\nhim according to the laws of the society, for his tale-telling. And\r\nin spite of the fact that he tried at every turn to avoid telling\r\nthe naked truth, and to escape here and there by professions of\r\nignorance, he eventually manifested to P. Mariano Gil all he knew\r\nof the society, of its plans and of its resources. After a long and\r\ntedious conversation, the patriotic Augustinian was gratified with\r\nthe knowledge of where to lay his hands upon hidden documents etc.,\r\nwhich would throw much light upon the purposes of the society of\r\ncut-throats. P. Gil immediately set to work to disclose the hidden\r\nsecrets.\r\n\r\n\"Without losing a moment,\" writes P. Mariano Gil, to a friend who\r\nhad asked of him the true story of what took place on that memorable\r\noccasion, \"I sent notice to the Lieut. of the Veterana of this\r\nsub-division, D. Jose Cortes, to whom in the presence of the denouncer,\r\nPatino, I communicated the most necessary data, giving him at the same\r\ntime the names of all those persons in the printing establishment who\r\nwere compromised, commencing with the two who signed the receipts,\r\nPolicarpo Tarla and Braulio Rivera, indicating to him the manner of\r\nprocedure for the detention of all those complicated.\r\n\r\n...................................................................\r\n... \"I decided, confiding in God, to go alone to the printing\r\nestablishment, at a time when none of the workmen should be present.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer goes on to explain how he made known his mission to D. Ramon\r\nMontes and two other Spaniards who, astonished at the news, aided in\r\nthe search for the documents, stones etc. After a half hour's search\r\nthe lithographic stone was discovered, and like a tiger springing\r\nupon its prey, the zealous son of St. Augustine pounced upon it, as\r\nthough he feared that the very roof of the building should fall in\r\nupon it and bury it beneath its rubbish out of reach of his hands. A\r\nproof was taken from the said stone, of the Katipunero receipts,\r\nand P. Gil immediately set off in the direction of the Veterana of\r\nTondo where he met Patino, who recognized the receipt as authentic,\r\nand two hours later the Patriotic Augustinian saw his efforts crowned\r\nwith the confession of guilt of the delinquents, the two previously\r\nnamed, figuring at the head of the list. Having performed this, P. Gil\r\nhumbly wended his way back to his parochial dwelling, satisfied to\r\nhave been an instrument of divine Providence for the unravelling of\r\none of the most bloodthirsty plots ever invented by the perverse mind\r\nof embruted mankind.\r\n\r\nAt midnight was discovered in the locker of Policarpo Tarla, in the\r\nsame place, a dagger, the regulations of the Katipunan and several\r\ndocuments having connection with the said society, all of which,\r\ntogether with the famous lithographic stone, were handed over by\r\nSr. Montes to the Veterana.\r\n\r\nOn the following day P. Gil discovered in the house of one of his\r\nparishioners a dagger identical to the one mentioned, also several\r\nreceipts in Tagalog with the key of the symbolic language in which\r\nthey were printed.\r\n\r\n\"This\", affirms P. Gil, \"is the truth of the discovery.\"\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that Patino was directly inspired more by the\r\nthrashing he received than by providence, although it is not possible\r\nto deny that the thrashing and the consequent divulging of the secrets\r\nof the Katipunan were providential. And as regards to his repentance,\r\nI doubt judging from the character of the average indian, whether he\r\nreally felt repentant till the enormity of the crime to which he was\r\nan abettor was brought home to him by P. Mariano Gil. Be that as it\r\nmay. The ways of Providence are hidden from us and we can seldom see,\r\nwith our human eyes, more than the actions of the human reason. Yet\r\nthe truth remains, that whether directly or indirectly inspired by\r\nprovidence it was Patino's action which saved Spain \"from an unending\r\nseries of bitter experiences.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 97. What has, up to this present, been written concerning these\r\nstirring events has been taken chiefly from the reports made by\r\nGen. Blanco to Sr. Canovas. Whether from ignorance or from malice,\r\nthese reports contained about as many errors as words. From these\r\nSr. Diaz evidently took the statement that the sister of Patino was a\r\npupil in the College of Looban, whereas P. Mariano Gil himself states\r\nthat it was that known as the Orphan Asylum for Girls at Mandaloya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 98. The following sketch of P. Mariano Gil is taken from the\r\nHeraldo de Madrid which in its number of the 6th October 1896, said:\r\n\r\n\"P. Gil was born in Carreon de los Condes (Palencia) on the 2nd of\r\nJuly 1849. Whilst still young he entered the Augustinian College of\r\nValladolid. His studies concluded, he passed to the Philippines where\r\nhe filled the duties of parish priest in several Tagalog pueblos. Till\r\nrecently he has been holding the position of parish priest of Tondo,\r\na suburb of Manila. He was fortunate enough to discover the plot\r\nof the insurrection on the 19th of August last, denouncing it at an\r\nopportune moment. The Spaniards gathered in manifestation to the palace\r\nof the Governor General; Sr. Blanco did not condescend to receive them\r\nand they therefore went at once to pay their respects to P. Gil and\r\nthe Archbishop, both of whom congratulated them for their patriotic\r\nattitude. A newspaper of Manila, El Espanol, published the picture\r\nof the parish priest of Tondo; but scarcely had the first copies\r\nof the paper appeared on the street, than General Blanco ordered\r\ntheir suppression, commanding that a new edition be printed omitting\r\nthe said picture and the laudatory phrases which the El Espanol had\r\ndedicated to the eminent Augustinian, from this time a note-worthy\r\npatriot to whom the public did a justice which General Blanco either\r\ndid not know how, or did not wish to do him.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of this patriotic Padre, Sr. Castillo y Jimenez [88] says:\r\n\r\n\"His character is gruff; he asks nothing, he demands; he does not\r\nbeseech, he asks; and what he demands and asks is just and lawful,\r\nbecause it bears in its essence the benefit of mankind, aiding the\r\nunfortunate, warding off their dangers, delivering them from the\r\nattacks which envy and vengeance might deal out to pacific and humble\r\npeople. He is inflexible with the reprobate and disloyal, magnanimous\r\nwith those who have been deceived; proud with the haughty and humble\r\nwith the weak, and in his generous life has wiped away many tears,\r\ndistributed much bread to the poor, and many times proportioned\r\nassistance to the needy that they should not fall into want.\"\r\n\r\nThe good work done in the discovery of the diabolical plot of the\r\nKatipunan, has very naturally been the object of a great amount\r\nof bitter criticism at the hands of the separatist element, which\r\nhas never pardoned the valiant Augustinian for springing their\r\ncarefully laid traps. He was denounced in the lodge rooms of Filipino\r\nfreemasonry, from one of which was despatched a letter directed to\r\nhim and bearing his picture, as will be seen in the accompanying\r\nillustration. His discovery was depreciated and belittled, and made\r\nto appear a farce. His patriotism was called into question and his\r\nvery life was placed in imminent danger.\r\n\r\nHowever the torrents of lies that have poured forth against him have\r\nnot, and can not obliterate the truth.\r\n\r\nIsabelo de los Reyes to belittle the labors of discovery of P. Gil,\r\naffirms that Antonio Luna notified Blanco of the existence of the\r\nassociation previous to the discovery of P. Gil. Be that as it may;\r\nthe secret police had also notified Blanco of what was going on. Three\r\ntimes did the Archbishop of Manila do the same, and so also did\r\nthe other prelates of Manila and Prior of the Convent of Guadalupe,\r\nand Lieut. Sityer [89]. But this does not lessen the value of Padre\r\nGil's discovery, but rather adds to its importance. For whilst Blanco\r\nwas sufficiently posted on the matter to be able to judge of the\r\nnecessity of taking immediate proceedings, there was wanting that\r\nhealthy stimulus which was given by P. Gil. A stubborn carbuncle\r\noften needs the aid of the lance: P. Gil's discovery was the lance\r\nwhich brought to the surface the putrid matter which nature could\r\nnot, of herself, eject. This putrid matter extending itself, would\r\nhave brought about the mortification of the whole body, had not the\r\nsurgeon applied his lance in good time. And although the lance of\r\nthe surgeon brought pain to the patient it saved her for the time,\r\ngiving back to her a state of relative health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 99. The first executions which took place were those of four\r\nrebels captured in flagrante in San Juan del Monte. These were Sancho\r\nValenzuela, Eugenio Silvestre, Modesto Sarmiento and Ramon Peralta. Of\r\nthese Valenzuela was the only one of any importance. Sarmiento was\r\na cabeza de barangay [90] of Santa Ana where he owned a small nipa\r\nhouse which he rented out, performing at the same time the office of\r\ncook and house boy to the tenant. On the way to execution he met his\r\ntenant-master and, in a nonchalant manner, greeted him with as pleasant\r\na Buenos dias Senor, as if he were on the way to some joyous function\r\nor a grand \"meet\" at the cock-pit. Before his execution Valenzuela\r\nalso showed a spirit of coolness and serenity, signing his last will\r\nand testament with a firm hand, and smiling. Both showed the spirit\r\nof men thoroughly fascinated by some superior power, neither realizing\r\nthe crime they had committed nor the punishment they were to undergo.\r\n\r\nThe second execution took place in Cavite, thirteen rebels being\r\nshot. These were Francisco Osorio, Maximo Inocencio, Luis Aguado,\r\nVictoriano Luciano, Hugo Perez, Jose Lallana, Antonio San Agustin,\r\nAgapito Conchu, Feliciano Cabuco, Mariano Gregorio, Eugenio Cabezas and\r\ntwo constables of the public prison of the province. These constables\r\nhad pressed into their traitorous service a number of the muchachos of\r\nthe prison. Francisco Osorio was a very wealthy Chinese half-caste. He\r\nhad been honored by Spain with several honors, among them the Grand\r\nCross of Carlos III. He was very intimate with the authorities in\r\nCavite. His father, a wealthy Chinee, and his cousin, a doctor,\r\nboth denounced him at the moment of his execution.\r\n\r\n\"After the reading of the sentence,\" says an eye-witness, \"in front\r\nof the square which we formed, he commenced to cry, asking pardon of\r\nthe General and of all Spaniards; he affirmed that he was a Spaniard\r\nand that he would never conspire again against the country in which\r\nhe had been educated, and he cursed the freemasons who in Madrid had\r\ninitiated him into the hatred of religion and the fatherland. The\r\ndoctor his cousin, turning to him, said: Silence Osorio! don't cry so;\r\nwhat will the Spaniards benefit from your repentance; but the miserable\r\nfellow paid no attention to him, and asked to be allowed to kiss the\r\nSpanish flag before he died. This permission was not granted.\"\r\n\r\nMaximo Inocencio was the proprietor of a large store and was a\r\ncontractor to the Arsenal. He had been previously arrested for\r\nimplication in the revolt in Cavite in 1872. At that time he escaped\r\nbut was afterwards pardoned; the signal rocket was to be fired from\r\nhis storehouse in Cavite.\r\n\r\nLuis Aguado was also a contractor for the Arsenal.\r\n\r\nVictoriano Luciano, a chemist, was a wealthy half-caste who had not\r\nlived long in Cavite.\r\n\r\nHugo Perez, was an indio. He was the venerable of the masonic lodge. In\r\nhis house were discovered two large photographs in which the majority\r\nof the thirteen persons executed were photographed in the form of\r\na triangle; a book with a triangle and other masonic insignia on\r\nits front page, and four important letters of anti-Spanish masonic\r\npropaganda.\r\n\r\nLallana was a tailor, and some say a peninsular Spaniard. For a while\r\nhe was chief of police of Cavite and had been a corporal of Marines.\r\n\r\nAntonio San Agustin was an indian, a petty merchant and a man who\r\ncould scarcely bear the sight of a Spaniard.\r\n\r\nAgapito Conchu was a master of a primary school, and a half-caste. He\r\nhad once been detained in the time of Despujols but granted his\r\nliberty. Apart from his school, he gave lessons to some of the children\r\nof the Spanish families of the town, including the daughter of the\r\nGovernor of Cavite.\r\n\r\nCabuco was an escribiente [91] of the administration of State; and\r\nEugenio Cabezas a watch-tinker.\r\n\r\nThese executions were followed by that of a member of the Guardia\r\nCivil, Mariano Magno, in Nueva Ecija. Magno had always been noted for\r\nhis lack of obedience to his superiors, his hatred of discipline and\r\nill-feeling in general towards Spaniards. Fifteen others were shot in\r\nIligan on the 28th of October of the same year. Many others suffered\r\nthe like penalty in different parts of the Archipelago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 100. Those sentenced to deportation were, for the most part, sent\r\nto Jolo, Puerta Princesa, Balabac and to the penitentiary colonies.\r\n\r\nTo the first named place were sent 69 persons of all kinds and\r\nconditions, trades and occupations. Among them was a Juan Cuadra,\r\na chemist in Ermita. To Puerta Princesa went 53, and to Balabac 56\r\nboth lots well assorted. Those most compromised in the insurrection\r\nwere sent to Fernando Poo, these numbering some 200. Three hundred\r\nmore were sent to Mindanao. Among the 200 sent to Fernando Poo were\r\nmerchants, compositors, silversmiths, book-binders, carriage painters,\r\nlaundrymen, escribientes, a clerk of the Puerta del Sol on the Escolta,\r\nhat-makers, tailors, laborers, students, lawyers and among them the\r\nirrepressible jack-in-the-box, Thomas William of the Rosary (Tomas\r\nG. del Rosario); telephone operators, school-teachers and three members\r\nof the secret police; among the rag and tag of the good-for-nothings,\r\nand as chief of them, was the famous translator of the scriptures,\r\nPascual H. Poblete [92].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 101. Apolinario Mabini was born in the pueblo of Tanauan,\r\nprovince of Batangas, and was the son of parents of the poorer and\r\nlower classes. He came to Manila as a lad and received his secondary\r\neducation in the College of San Juan de Letran at the hands of\r\nthe Dominican Fathers, taking the degree of professor. Later on he\r\nwas employed in the Intendencia and by careful saving and by steady\r\napplication he continued his studies for law and concluded his course\r\nat the University of Santo Tomas also at the hands of the Dominicans\r\nwho spared no efforts on behalf of his success. From the University\r\nhe received the title of Licentiate of Law in 1895.\r\n\r\nHe entered the office of the notary Numeriano Adriano to practice\r\nlaw, and whilst there employed, was drawn by Adriano into the net of\r\nmasonry, joining the lodge Balagtas which was one of those founded\r\nfrom the overflow of the original Filipino lodge Nilad. Adriano was\r\nthe venerable of the said lodge. When the Liga Filipina was formed\r\nand had gotten well into working order Mabini was named a councillor\r\nof the superior Council (see page 28). According to the testimony\r\nof Moises Salvador (see page 296) Mabini was also secretary of the\r\nAssociation of Compromisarios.\r\n\r\nHe was arrested as one of the chief instigators of the revolt and\r\nafter due trial was sentenced to death. The Spanish authorities\r\nhowever, took compassion upon him because of his pitiful condition,\r\nhe being paralysed in the lower parts of the body [93]; so instead\r\nof including his name in the list of those who expiated their treason\r\non the field of Bagumbayan, they foolishly gave him his liberty.\r\n\r\nOnce more free, Mabini left Manila for his own pueblo of Tanauan\r\nwhere he lived quietly till Aguinaldo was brought over in 1898 by\r\nAdmiral Dewey to serve as a bush-beater to the American forces. Mabini\r\nwas thereupon carried from Tanauan to Cavite where he joined the\r\nfaithless Magdalo.\r\n\r\nIn Cavite he drew up a project of a constitutional law for the\r\nPhilippines. In the first page of this he affirmed that the precepts\r\nof the Ten Commandments were an invention of the friars! And yet Mabini\r\nwas the Filipino Solomon. He instructed the people that they ought not\r\nto believe in the said decalogue or practice what it commanded, but\r\nthat they should only practice the precepts of the Verdadero Decalogo\r\nwhich he prepared and gave to the public as their spiritual guide.\r\n\r\nMabini very soon became radical and decidedly anti-American in his\r\nideas, and succeeded in attaining such moral ascendancy over Aguinaldo\r\nthat the latter ceased to be the leader of the people and the true\r\ndictator of the Filipino republic, becoming a toy in the hands of a\r\nman who could twist and turn him here and there at his will.\r\n\r\nMabini refused to take the oath of allegiance and was, on the 7th\r\nof January 1901 deported under General Order No. 4 to the island of\r\nGuam, as one of the persons \"whose acts clearly demonstrate them to\r\nbe favorers or sympathizers with the insurrection.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 102. The advanced political ideas held and propagated by the\r\nseparatists were not bad in themselves; no particular objection can be\r\nraised against them as political ideas. But when we consider by whom\r\nand for whom these \"reforms\" were asked, we begin to appreciate the\r\nnecessity to which the indian was put of endeavoring to attain them\r\nby armed struggle. Taking away the revolutionary basis upon which the\r\nplans of the Liga were raised, nothing remains but the empty walls of\r\na roofless building. These walls or ideas are contained in the plans of\r\nreforms drawn up by almost every jackanapes in the Liga who could write\r\ndown his thoughts with any amount of clearness. These plans agreed upon\r\ncertain points, chiefly representation in the Spanish parliament and\r\nthe expulsion of the Religious Orders. These two points appear to have\r\nbeen the essence of the direct aims of the separatists (see p. 69).\r\n\r\nOthers called for the Spanish constitution with its consequences:\r\nthe liberty of the press and the liberty of associations. Liberty of\r\nthe press was ever an unknown quantity in the Philippines. The idea of\r\nthe liberty of the press is very beautiful when its liberties are not\r\nabused; it was the abuse of what little liberty the press enjoyed,\r\nin the latter days of Spanish rule, that induced the authorities\r\nto impose such a close censure upon it as they did. Whatever may\r\nbe said in its favor, press censorship and such sedition laws as we\r\nenjoy to-day in this nondescript piece of the world's surface, are\r\nmore proper of absolute monarchies than of territory of the U. S. of\r\nAmerica, although in our particular case we might as well be under the\r\ndespotic, ever deteriorating rule of Aguinaldo, as that of a body of\r\nmen whose intentions however good and sincere they may be, fall short,\r\nwhen put into practice, of the proverbial ingenuity in governing,\r\nof the famous Sancho Panza in his island of Barataria. Freedom of\r\nthe press is at times a blessing, and at others a curse. From 1888\r\nto 1896 it would have been more of the latter than of the former;\r\nfor giving such a liberty to the separatists who asked it, would be\r\narming the enemy with the best arms.\r\n\r\nAs to liberty of associations. People in the Temperance world often ask\r\nthemselves, does prohibition prohibit? Some make themselves believe\r\nthat it does; but practice has shown what common sense tells each\r\nand every one of us, that it does not; for if a man (and I do not\r\nwish to be so ungallant as to exclude the ladies) cannot get what\r\nhe wants legally, he as a rule sees that he gets it somehow. And so\r\nwith the Filipinos who, denied the liberty of association, defied the\r\nauthorities and held their gatherings in secret and secluded places.\r\n\r\nAll these various political ideas were decidedly advanced in as much as\r\nthey had relation to a people in no way prepared to receive them. No\r\nfather would put a loaded revolver or an open razor into the hands\r\nof his child; but those were the very things the separatists were\r\nhowling for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A.\r\n\r\n                           A.

We will now pass on to the enumeration of the same.\r\n\r\nFirst: The triangles will perform strictly all and every one of the\r\ndispositions dictated by their respective presidents, and venerable\r\nhonorary brethren, not allowing the least or most insignificant point\r\nto slip their observation, for even when it seems to our venerable\r\nbrethren otherwise, it is of the greatest transcendency.\r\n\r\n\"The smallest omission in these dispositions might prejudice in a\r\ngreat manner our labors, the fruit of many years of constancy and\r\nhope of a sure triumph.\r\n\r\n\"Second: Once the signal is given every bro. shall fulfill the duty\r\nimposed upon him by this Gr.

They are\r\nmost commonly met with in the form of amulets which their possessors\r\ncarry about with them to ward off dangers of all kinds. There are\r\namulets for protection against fire arms, against sword thrust\r\nor bolo slash; against diseases of all parts of the body; amulets\r\nagainst the bursting of fire arms or to prevent them making a noise\r\nwhen discharged by the wearer of the amulet; against snakes and their\r\nbites, against lightning; amulets to protect their wearers against the\r\ncourts of justice and against the authorities when they pursue them\r\nfor robbery. In a word amulets or anting-anting against everything.\r\n\r\nAs a rules these amulets consist of small booklets containing prayers\r\ncomposed of Latin and Spanish words mixed with words and abbreviations\r\nof the native dialects. Some times they are stones or mineral deposits\r\nfound in the bodies of animals, or the seed portion of petrified\r\nfruits, or even parts of the skeletons of children.\r\n\r\nAlthough one would suppose that such superstitions had long since\r\nceased to exist among the indians of the archipelago such is not the\r\ncase; and it is more than probable that the majority of the members\r\nof the federal party and may be two out of the three native members\r\nof the Commission carry their anting-anting carefully guarded in\r\none of their pockets. However their use is most common among native\r\ndoctors, that is those who have not studied medicine, but who dabble\r\nin the art for what they can get out of it, and by tulisanes or armed\r\nrobbers. They were also much in vogue among the enlightened officers\r\nand men of the insurgent ranks, many of whom considered themselves\r\nperfectly safe from the bullets of their enemies when they carried\r\nin their person an amulet or anting-anting.\r\n\r\nThe following are samples of pages of one of the booklets found on\r\nthe person of a wounded tulisan. The first of these two pages contains\r\na prayer against fire-arms, and the second a conglomeration which no\r\none has never been able to decipher.\r\n\r\n\r\n    +---------------------------+ +-----------------------------+\r\n    |   talis misererenobis     | |                             |\r\n    |          Amin.            | |    Prele queno niar en res  |\r\n    |                           | |      tom Domi nom nos tom   |\r\n    |   Oracion de S.

He\r\napproached the altar to recite the Mass, and upon genuflecting at\r\nthe centre of the altar noticed that there was something unusual,\r\nalthough small, under the altar cloth. He put his hand under the\r\ncloth to see what it was and found there a slip of paper bearing\r\nthree crosses, thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n                              +    +    +\r\n\r\n\r\nThis paper had been carelessly folded and placed where he found it,\r\nupon the altar stone. Had it remained undisturbed and the service of\r\nMass been said over it, it would have, in the belief of the indian\r\nwho put it there, become infused with marvelous virtues and could\r\nhave protected its wearer from the dangers to be incurred in the\r\narmed rising against the Spaniards which they were about to attempt.\r\n\r\nIn all probability Buencamino carried some anting-anting with him to\r\nWashington to protect him from assassination or from ... nausea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Manila, 10th January 1897.\r\n\r\n\"I Faustino Villaruel y Zapanta, 52 years of age, publicly declare\r\nthat as I was born so wish I to die--a Spaniard, a christian, a Roman\r\nApostolic Catholic; and that I detest with my whole soul any rebellion\r\nor treason against our beloved mother Spain.\r\n\r\n\"I also repent of having belonged to masonry and of having devoted\r\nmyself to its propaganda in these islands and having been such a\r\nbigoted mason that I caused my two children to enter also into the\r\nsociety I now curse.

There it was that steps were\r\ntaken to catechize the masses of the Filipinos in their own homes.\r\n\r\n[4] In the Official Bulletin of the Gr. Or. Esp. for Sept. 1896,\r\nMorayta, speaking of this association of separatists said: \"It was\r\nborn strong,--the filipino colony numbered then more than 70 members,\r\nby the side of whom labored several peninsular Spaniards.\" It is a\r\npity Morayta did not classify these peninsular Spaniards, for had he\r\ndone so we might perhaps have found among their number some of the\r\nsocial outcasts who have since aided the insurgent element against\r\nthe legitimate authority of the United States.\r\n\r\n[5] These aspirations almost all turned upon the idea of\r\nindependence. The ability of the natives to govern themselves has\r\nhad many tests. During the last days of Spanish rule a taste of this\r\nprivilege in minor grade was allowed the native as a test, and it\r\nneeded but a drop of the independence tincture to put the patient\r\ninto a burning fever. It truly takes a visionary to claim for the\r\nFilipino the ability to govern his own country. In the Filipino family\r\nthe woman \"wears the breeches\" and in the pueblo all is subservient\r\nto the \"boss\", the presidente. The aspirations of the pre-American\r\nFilipinos are the same as the aspirations of the Federal Party:\r\naspirations which can never be realized till the character of the\r\naspirant radically changes. \"Filipinas\" yet awaits in expectation to\r\nfind the Filipino who can govern his own household!\r\n\r\n[6] The executive committee of the Liga was composed of Moises\r\nSalvador, Ambrosio Flores, Apolinario Mabini, Domingo Franco, Numeriano\r\nAdriano, Timoteo Paez, Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista, and the brothers\r\nVenancio and Alejandro Reyes. Testimony of Antonio Salazar. (fols. 1118\r\nto 1129).\r\n\r\n[7] The words Supreme Society express the idea of supreme social\r\nsituation, of a society formed of noteworthy people. A well-read writer\r\non the subject of \"El Katipunan o el filibusterismo en Filipinas,\"\r\nsays, speaking of this union of such notable folk: \"A reunion of\r\npeople who meet to concoct assassinations, cannot be a reunion of\r\nnoteworthy people but should rather be called a reunion of noteworthy\r\ncriminals.\" There is not the shadow of a doubt that this is the best\r\nand, in fact, the only title to which such a society as the katipunan\r\ncan justly lay claim.\r\n\r\nOpinion is divided as to the origin of the word katipunan, and as to\r\nthe manner in which it should be written. Some spell it with C whilst\r\nthe majority use K. As to the derivation: the root word is undoubtedly\r\nTipon which, prefixed with the particle ca and terminated with an\r\ngives us a word, which signifies very select association. The word\r\nis however generally written with K so as to be in keeping with the\r\nTagalog way of spelling, as they (that is to say the \"redimidos\" have\r\ntaken to the use of K for C whenever C has a hard sound as in cat. In\r\nlike manner, to the insurgent and his sympathisers, Cavite should be\r\nKawite. The K and W are Blumentrittisms, i. e. of German descent.\r\n\r\n[8] See note 49.\r\n\r\n[9] The pseudonym of Rizal. By this name he is mentioned in almost\r\nall the masonic documents relating to him and over this same name he\r\nwrote in the La Solidaridad and the Kalayaan.\r\n\r\n[10] The place of Rizal's banishment.\r\n\r\n[11] Pio Valenzuela y Alejandro, a near companion of Bonifacio in\r\nmatters relative to the Katipunan, testified in his evidence in the\r\ncourts of Justice, (fols 1,663 to 1,673), that Andres Bonifacio had\r\nread much, and possessed a library which was destroyed when his house\r\ncaught fire. (See note 16) That he would pass the night in reading\r\ninstead of sleeping, and that from such an excess of reading there\r\nhad happened to him the same as happened to Don Quixote--his brain\r\nhad become turned. Thus it was that Andres was ever dreaming of the\r\npresidency and speaking of the French Revolution.\r\n\r\n[12] It was in the warehouse of this German firm that the Spanish\r\nauthorities discovered the documentary evidence which Valenzuela\r\ntestified had been hidden there by Bonifacio. It had been determined\r\nby the Katipunan to destroy all documents, but evidently Bonifacio\r\novertaken suddenly by the unexpected discovery of the plot he was\r\ndeveloping, had not sufficient presence of mind, or what is more\r\nprobable still, enough time to put them out of existence, and he\r\ntherefore hid them as has been said, hoping no doubt, to be thus\r\nenabled to put the authorities off the track in case they should\r\nhappen to get possession of them.\r\n\r\n[13] That is to say the Spanish population.\r\n\r\n[14] As the events here spoken of do not fall within the scope of\r\nthis sketch, no note has here been made of them. As was pointed out\r\nin the introduction, this review is not intended as a history of the\r\nrevolution, but as a brief sketch of the society which gave rise to it.\r\n\r\n[15] Avisos y profecias, Madrid 1892. pp. 286-308.\r\n\r\n[16] Concerning the doctrines of Universal Freemasonry D. Gabriel\r\nJogand-Pages says writing on the subject of freemasonry in Spain:\r\n\"The teaching which according to the ritual of the 33rd degree is\r\nthe synthesis of freemasonry, is well worthy of being borne in mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the reception to the 33rd degree, the Grand Master turning to\r\nthe person to be received, ends his discourse with the following\r\nsignificant exhortation:\r\n\r\n\"I owe you, Illustrious brother, an explanation which it is necessary\r\nto give to our rituals.\"\r\n\r\n\"Masonry being nothing else than active revolution, permanent\r\nconspiracy against political and religious despotism,....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Grand Master innocent, you have already seen, is man ... man\r\nwho was born innocent because he was born unconsciously.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our Grand Master Innocent was born to be happy and to enjoy in\r\nall their fullness all his rights without exception: But he fell,\r\nstruck with the blows of three assassins: of three infamous beings\r\nwho placed formidable obstacles in the way of his happiness, and\r\nagainst his rights....\"\r\n\r\n\"These three infamous assassins are: the Law, Property and Religion\".\r\n\r\n\"The Law because it is not in harmony with the rights of the individual\r\nman and the duties of the man who lives in society: rights which all\r\nacquire in all their integrity....\"\r\n\r\n\"Property: because the earth is the property of no one and its products\r\npertain to all in the measure for each one of the true necessities\r\nfor his welfare.\"\r\n\r\n\"Religion: because religions are no more than the philosophies of\r\nmen of talent, which the people have adopted....\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither the Law, Property nor Religion can impose themselves upon\r\nman, and as they deprive him of his most precious rights they are\r\nassassins against whom we have sworn to exercise the utmost vengeance.\r\n\r\n\"Of these three infamous enemies, Religion ought to be the object of\r\nour constant mortal attacks, because a people never have survived\r\ntheir religion, and destroying religion we have at our disposition\r\nthe law and property and we can then regenerate society, establishing\r\nover the ruins, masonic Religion, masonic Law and masonic property.\"\r\n\r\n[17] \"Insurreccion en Filipinas\"; vol. I. p. 109.\r\n\r\n[18] One not acquainted with the seducing nature of the masonic\r\noperation and the peculiarity of the native character, would wonder\r\nto find the name of a Catholic priest so intimately connected with\r\nfreemasonry and its offspring, especially in a country in which\r\nthe Church wages close and continual warfare with the evil. There\r\nis little need for surprise however, when we consider the seductive\r\ninfluence of the one hand and the simplicity and childishness of the\r\nnative character on the other. Many of the native clergy were body\r\nand soul wrapt up in the workings of freemasonry and were Spain's\r\nworst and most crafty enemies.\r\n\r\nIn Nueva Caceres, Inocencio Herrera, Severo Estrada and Severino Diaz,\r\nthree native priests of the Cathedral of that diocese, headed the\r\nconspiracy against the Government. They formed a deposit of arms and\r\nammunition in the organ of the Cathedral and, according to the plan\r\nthey had prepared, one of their first steps was to murder the Bishop\r\nof the diocese. On this point it will be interesting to quote the\r\ntestimony of Tomas Prieto, of Nueva Caceres, who, whilst on board\r\nthe S. S. Isarog, on the 20th of September 1896, testified in the\r\npresence of the captain of the Ship and other witnesses that he had\r\nreceived 50 rifles, 10 of which he had given into the care of Manuel\r\nAbella, a millionaire of that province who was eventually executed for\r\ntreason; the remainder he had distributed among other persons, 3 being\r\nplaced in the care of Severino Diaz, parish priest of the Cathedral of\r\nNueva Caceres.... As to their plans of action, he testified that the\r\nintention was to kill all the Spaniards, the mentioned parish priest of\r\nthe Cathedral, the coadjutor Inocencio and Severo Estrada, all natives,\r\nhaving promised to aid personally to secure the success of the affair.\r\n\r\nHe also declared that \"on the 9th of July of the same year, a reunion\r\nwas celebrated in the house of Manuel Abella, and among those present\r\nwere Gabriel Prieto, a native priest and brother of the witness,\r\nSeverino Diaz and others; it was in this reunion that it was decided\r\nto carry out the programme above mentioned.\"\r\n\r\nIn both provinces of the Camarines many were mixed up in some of the\r\ndirtiest work of the revolt.\r\n\r\nInnumerable cases might be mentioned also in which the native clergy\r\nhave exerted considerable influence against the American Government,\r\ninciting the rebels to resist its lawful authority, much to the\r\ndetriment of the interests of the Church and bringing down upon\r\nthe clergy in general accusations of sedition and treachery. Juan\r\nCastaneda testified that he had been initiated into the mysteries\r\nof freemasonry by Severo Buenaventura, a native priest, coadjutor\r\nof Imus. Buenaventura received his initiation from Ambrosio Flores,\r\nnow the Governor of the province of Rizal; he possessed three grades\r\nand enjoyed the use of the symbolic name of \"cuitib\" (the name of a\r\nsmall ant which bites furiously). Nine native priests were sent to\r\nManila from Vigan and La Union; all of these were convicted of treason.\r\n\r\n[19] The word in the original Spanish is madrasta which, apart from\r\nthat of step-mother, has the meaning of \"anything disagreeable.\"\r\n\r\n[20] See note 26.\r\n\r\n[21] For the complete document see appendix A.\r\n\r\n[22] A contract was made between the administrator of the estate in\r\nquestion, situated at Calamba, and Francisco Mercado Rizal, father of\r\nthe subject of this note, for the land the Rizal family occupied and\r\ncultivated. This land measured some 500 hectares and was clear and\r\nclean, the tenant having merely to give it three or four turns with\r\nthe plow in order to prepare it for use. To show the treatment meted\r\nout to the tenant, it will be sufficient to say that the contract\r\nagreed that the tenant should have the entire use of the land and\r\nits product for four harvests or five years RENT FREE. As great as\r\nthis advantage was to the Rizal family it is but a little of what\r\nwas done by the Dominicans for that ungrateful family of filibusters.\r\n\r\n[23] Lawyer.\r\n\r\n[24] \"La Independencia\" was a revolutionary daily of four pages,\r\npublished in the Orphan Asylum of Malabon, property of the Augustinian\r\nCorporation and stolen and eventually totally destroyed by the \"ever\r\ndestructive\" Tagalog rebels during the revolution. The first number\r\nwas published on Saturday, 3rd Sept. 1898. Its leading article is\r\nan exposition of the purpose of the publication of the paper, which\r\nwas the defense of the independence of the Philippines. \"We defend,\r\nsays the writer of the article, the independence of the Philippines\r\nbecause it is the aspiration of the country which has come of age;\r\nand when a people rise as a man to protest, arm in hand, against a\r\npolicy of oppression and injustice, it manifests sufficient vitality\r\nto live free.\" This is a fair sample of the style of the conduct of the\r\npaper. It is worthy of note that the history of the revolt has clearly\r\nshown that, in the first place, independence was not the aspiration of\r\nthe people, but a fanciful hope of a handful of exploiters; secondly\r\nthat the country has not come of age, not having even reached the age\r\nof puberty; thirdly that the people did not rise as a man but that the\r\nTagal \"discontents\" were the body and soul of the whole insurrection\r\nboth against Spain and against the U. S.; and finally, that the \"policy\r\nof oppression and injustice\" was imaginary, the same complaint having\r\nsince been made against the Government of Washington as was then made\r\nagainst the Government of Madrid. The quotation concerning Luna is\r\ntaken from No. 2 of the paper published on the 5th of Sept. 1898.\r\n\r\n[25] The principal works of Juan Luna are: The death of Cleopatra for\r\nwhich he received a silver medal; this was painted under the tutorship\r\nof Sr. Vera. Under the same master he painted the Spoliarium for which\r\nhe was rewarded a gold medal, but this not really for the merit of the\r\npicture but in order to put an end to a rivalry between two Spanish\r\npainters. On his own account he painted and gave forth The Battle\r\nof Lepanto; this was received almost with hisses and was heartily\r\ncriticized. Also the Profanation of the Tombs; if anything this was\r\nworse. As the savage nature which lay dormant in his breast became\r\nmore and more awakened his paintings became more and more decadescent:\r\nhis Pacto-de-Sangre, in the which he inspired the return to one of\r\nthe most barbarous customs of pre-Spanish times in the archipelago,\r\nrubs off the last touches of the veneer of civilization which formed\r\nthe dividing line between the indian of the city and the indian of\r\nthe mountain and forest.\r\n\r\n[26] \"Andres Bonifacio told the witness that he communicated with the\r\npresident of the Superior Supreme Council, who was Francisco L.

In this matter of the flight of Bonifacio he stated that \"it was\r\nnot exact as had been said, that Andres Bonifacio was in Cavite (at\r\nthat particular time), for after the defeat at San Juan del Monte he\r\ndisappeared with the funds of the Katipunan, which amounted to some\r\n20,000 pesos, as he had been assured.\"\r\n\r\n[32] Having been asked during his trial whether he was aware of the\r\nhiding place of Bonifacio, Valenzuela (fol. 600 to 605) stated that\r\n\"he was not aware of the place in which Bonifacio and others were to\r\nbe met with; that he merely supposed that Bonifacio could be found\r\nin the mountains of San Mateo, in Tapusi, in other words in the most\r\ninaccessible part of the said mountain range; because the witness\r\nheard him say that he would retire to that point to dedicate himself\r\nto highway robbery if the movement should not be successful.\r\n\r\n[33] \"The generalisimo, captain Emilio, is very indignant with the\r\nconduct of Andres Bonifacio, upon whose head he has set a price,\r\noffering a good recompense to the one who will present him dead or\r\nalive, for he says that he cannot consent to such a desertion after\r\nhe had been the principal promoter of the popular rebellion\". From\r\nthe statement of Pedro Gonzalez previously quoted.\r\n\r\n[34] See foot-note page 114.\r\n\r\n[35] The head offices of the La Democracia in Manila are situated\r\non Calle Villalobos, a name which put into English signifies wolf\r\nvillage. For the headquarters of such a scurrilous sheet and for such\r\na political party no better place could be found, for taking the two\r\nat their very best they are veritable \"wolves in sheep's clothing\".\r\n\r\n[36] See page 60.\r\n\r\n[37] Nilad is the name of a plant, from which is derived the name\r\nof Manila.\r\n\r\n[38] In an interesting pamphlet entitled \"Vexata Questio\", giving\r\na brief sketch of three centuries of history in the Philippines,\r\npublished in Manila in 1901, the author, in a foot note to page 28,\r\nsays of Foreman:\r\n\r\n\"It should be remarked that this writer, in the first edition of his\r\nwork, claims to be an earnest Catholic. Dean Worcester, who copies\r\nfrom Foreman's book some of the most drivelling paragraphs, lays\r\nparticular stress upon this fact. I leave it to the common sense of\r\nany one who has read Foreman's history, or what Worcester stoops so\r\nlow to copy therefrom, whether a man whose Alpha and Omega is truly\r\nanti-Catholic and often anti-christian, and the ink of whose pen\r\nsavors of Catholic blood shed upon the altars of Freemasonry can be\r\na Catholic, at least an honorable one.\"\r\n\r\nForeman was a traveller in machinery and as such was enabled to\r\nget to all the principal parts of the Archipelago. He was, as he\r\nhimself confesses, always well received in the pueblos, and greeted\r\nby the parish priests (friars) and lodged in the convents free of\r\ncost. Although Foreman did not perform vile practical jokes upon\r\nunsuspecting and inoffensive hosts as did the now \"commissioner\"\r\nWorcester in his travels, he did many things no honorable man would\r\nhave done. Although he professed himself a Catholic it was only for\r\n\"business\" purposes; one has only to read the preface to his book to\r\nfind that out.\r\n\r\nForeman was an Englishman, disliked by the English, despised by\r\neveryone he came in contact with; and if the things said of him by\r\nhis intimate acquaintances, are true, then he well deserved the snubs\r\nhe has lately received all round.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of April 1899, before the members of the Schurman\r\nCommission, Neil Macleod testified of Foreman, as follows:\r\n\r\nQuestioned by Worcester:\r\n\r\nQ. Have you read Foreman's book?\r\n\r\nA. Yes; I know him personally.\r\n\r\nQ. Was he a Catholic?\r\n\r\nA. I do not know.\r\n\r\nQ. He says so?\r\n\r\nA. Yes.\r\n\r\nQ. He is an engineer, isn't he?\r\n\r\nA. He has been here frequently travelling all over the country,\r\nselling machinery.\r\n\r\nQ. You know he attacks the Church?\r\n\r\nA. He attacks the church very much, and he ought to be very thankful\r\nto the priests, for they have been very good to him; ...............\r\n....................................................................\r\n\r\nconsidering that he availed himself of their services and hospitality\r\nall over the country, he should have thought twice before putting a\r\nthing like that (his history) into print.\"\r\n\r\nWorcester was fishing for trout and caught a crab. He got enough and\r\nthe subject ... suddenly changed.\r\n\r\n[39] See Appendix G.\r\n\r\n[40] Philippinos: insular Spaniards, or Spaniards born in the\r\nPhilippines. Filipino: more commonly known as indio: that is, an\r\nindian native of the Archipelago.\r\n\r\n[41] For this decree see Appendix H.\r\n\r\n[42] He was conducted from calle Iris blindfolded in a quilez (a\r\nvehicle of the country) to a house which he later on discovered to\r\nbe that of Bonifacio, situated in calle Oroquieta.\r\n\r\n[43] In an official letter of the Grand Secretary of the Oriente\r\nEspanol to the Lodge Nilad, dated Madrid 8th of June 1892, the\r\nsecretary, warning the said lodge to be careful in the performance\r\nof its labors says: \"... not all men, although they profess our ideas\r\nand doctrines, serve for good masons.\"\r\n\r\n[44] \"The oath bound (the Katipuneros) as well as the militares\r\n(the rebel army) were to be supported and equipped by several wealthy\r\npersons of Manila, among them D. Francisco Roxas who was in charge of\r\nthe maintenance of the rebel army.\" Testimony of 2nd Lieut Benedicto\r\nNijaga y Polonio. (fols. 222-224)\r\n\r\n[45] See Appendix I.\r\n\r\n[46] Wildman will probably be long remembered by many who suffered\r\nbrutalities and tortures at the hands of Aguinaldo's horde of\r\ncut-throats, inspired by the late Consul's advise.\r\n\r\nCorrespondence took place between Aguinaldo and Wildman concerning\r\nthe Spanish prisoners. In reply to a request of the Dictator,\r\nWildman wrote:\r\n\r\n\"Never mind feeding them. A meal every day, of course, and water\r\nwill be a good diet. They have been living too high during the last\r\nfew years. As the Spaniards want more bloodshed in the Philippines,\r\nI trust you will let them have a taste of real war. Do not be so\r\ntender with them, etc., etc.\"\r\n\r\nLittle did Wildman think that the day would come when these words\r\nof his would inspire equal or greater barbarity against his own\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\nThe publication of the valuable papers in Wildman's possession at\r\nthe time of his death in the shipwreck which occurred almost at the\r\nvery door of his home would doubtless throw much light upon the past\r\nfour years of Philippine history. The shipment of tons upon tons of\r\nammunition, a large shipment of which left London on the \"Inaba Maru,\"\r\non the 25th of September 1899, addressed to the \"American Consul\",\r\nHong-Kong, have yet to be accounted for.\r\n\r\n[47] There were always plenty of funds, but the money too often stuck\r\nto the fingers of those who had the handling of it.\r\n\r\n[48] A name given among Spaniards, to young servant boys or girls. The\r\nword signifies servant and is used as such in the same manner as in\r\nBritish Oriental colonies the word boy is used,--irrespective of age.\r\n\r\n[49] Nipa.--Nipa fructificans.--Nipa is a small palm which grows in\r\nsalt water. From it the natives make a species of wine and vinegar,\r\nwhilst its leaves serve to thatch their houses. It is one of the\r\nplants of most utility to the indian.\r\n\r\n[50] The reason for Rizal's deportation is set forth clearly in the\r\ndecree of Deportation which is given entire in Appendix.\r\n\r\n[51] As a sample of these statements I will quote the following\r\ndocument, which is one of a number copied from a book of decrees\r\nreceived by the Revolutionary authorities of the pueblo of Mendez\r\nNunez, province of Cavite,\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"K. K. K.\"\r\n    \"Chiefs of each pueblo\"\r\n\r\n    \"In the urgent letter received to-day from the General (Aguinaldo)\r\n    concrete notice is given that to-day there have anchored the\r\n    warships proceeding from Japan to our assistance, and it is\r\n    said, that they are now just on the other side of the island\r\n    of Corregidor....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis document is dated 11th September 1896, and is signed by El\r\ncapitan comandante, Crisostomo Riel.\r\n\r\n[52] What a fine president he would have made for the Federal\r\nParty! Castaneda was worthy of an office in the Ayuntamiento with a\r\nsign over the door--Hon. Juan Castaneda, Native Commissioner.\r\n\r\n[53] Ambrosio Flores: (bro. musa) was the Gr. Pres. of the\r\nGr. Cons. Reg. of the Philippines. (See note 23)--Moises Salvador\r\nstated of him in his declaration (fols. 1,138-1,143), in reply\r\nto a question as to the manner in which Flores was affiliated to\r\nfilibusterism, that \"by reason of his high position in freemasonry,\r\nhe aided the ends of the filibusters, making propaganda among those\r\naffiliated to the lodges.\" He stated, at the same time that Flores,\r\nin no concept, formed part of the Liga or Compromisarios. It was\r\nAmbrosio Flores who, at the opportune moment let fall the masonic\r\nsledge hammer upon the back of Pedro Serrano, charging him with being\r\na traitor (see note 12) to the cause.\r\n\r\n[54] I have frequently quoted the \"Memoria\" of Isabelo de los\r\nReyes, because I consider that whilst in it he exaggerates and lies\r\nconsiderably, there are yet points upon which what he says has all\r\nthe probability of the truth, in as much as when he finds it pays to\r\ntell the truth he tells it. In this particular point, however, it is\r\n\"according to what is said.\"\r\n\r\n[55] How much this reminds me of the story of the little boy who\r\nwent to the grocer's and asked for 10 cents worth of molasses. The\r\nshop-keeper measured out the molasses into the jug and asked the\r\nlittle boy for the dime, receiving the reply: \"its at the bottom of\r\nthe jug.\" And that's just where the other little boy's money would\r\nhave been.\r\n\r\n[56] In the official extract of advice given by the Secret Service to\r\nthe Gov. Gen. Blanco, we read: \"Aug 1. Notice is hereby given that,\r\nby references from Japan, the Gov. Gen. has received from the Emperor\r\nof that nation some messages which had been directed to him by some\r\n22,000 Filipinos in representation of the native inhabitants of these\r\nislands, and in the which, after congratulating him for his triumphs\r\nover the Chinese Empire, asks his protection and shelter for this\r\nArchipelago, and its annexation to the Japanese Empire.\"\r\n\r\n[57] The word Kongo signifies Imperial diamond.\r\n\r\n[58] The Bazar Japones situated in Plaza Moraga.\r\n\r\n[59] Typical of the heads of the twelve apostles of filibusterism.\r\n\r\n[60] In his \"Memoria\".\r\n\r\n[61] I am inclined to differ somewhat with this opinion. What is more\r\nprobable is that as regards the actual membership there existed a\r\ngulf between the wealthy and the lower classes which was bridged by\r\nthe representatives of either association. I have not come across any\r\nconcrete evidence that the two elements really mixed, the one with\r\nthe other; the inborn pride of the Chinese half caste, the class from\r\nwhich, the majority of the wealthy elements came, and of the indio\r\nof money or political \"pull\", would not permit such a mixture of the\r\ntwo associations Senor Valdes supposes.\r\n\r\n[62] See appendix A.\r\n\r\n[63] See note 56; also foot-note, page 180.\r\n\r\n[64] The witness might have added that Blanco as a mason did more than\r\n\"know\" of it: he took no steps to counter-act it, till circumstances\r\ndemanded that harsh measures should be taken to maintain national\r\nhonor.\r\n\r\n[65] In plain English, this is a lie and no one could know it better\r\nthan the witness.\r\n\r\n[66] By an element. Even would-be-president Bryan has his followers\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n[67] In other words: he allowed a certain wealthy and influential\r\nclass of people to lead him around wherever they would, by the nose.\r\n\r\n[68] This statement is the result of either ignorance or malice. (See\r\nnote 97, 98.) This account also materially differs from the \"faked up\"\r\nstory of Legarda. How little some people know of the truth when they\r\ndo not wish to tell it!\r\n\r\n[69] This is another. Now that Tavera and Legarda are side by side in\r\nthe U. S. Commission they might compare their testimony with advantage:\r\nit might aid them to preserve somewhat of the truth in future.\r\n\r\n[70] It would be interesting to know just how many of the late\r\ninsurgents who now hold position of importance under the Government,\r\nare following up this piece of advice of Aguinaldo.\r\n\r\n[71] Domestic: i. e., made for household use, for cutting up meat,\r\ncutting down bamboos, and in fact for every use for which a knife or\r\nchopper is needed.\r\n\r\n[72] Castillo y Jimenez; El Katipunan o el filibusterismo en Filipinas:\r\npp. 128-129.\r\n\r\n[73] That is men of the lower classes, laborers.\r\n\r\n[74] It is difficult to determine whether such statements are due\r\nto ignorance or to malice. The real truth of the situation is that\r\nalthough the friar came to the Philippines to perform sacerdotal\r\nduties and preach the Gospel, his beneficial influence was not\r\nconfined to the mere preaching of the Gospel. \"What most honors the\r\nwhole membership past and present of the Religious Orders is the\r\nintense zeal shown in the temporal as well as the spiritual welfare\r\nof their parishioners. To merely defeat and drive out the bad that\r\nwas in them was not sufficient, for Satan finds mischief for idle\r\nhands, and when one devil is driven out of a man he roams around\r\nseeking other devils with whom he returns and re-enters the soul\r\nand \"the last state of that man becomes worse than the first.\" So\r\nto thoroughly carry out their christianizing and civilizing purpose\r\nthey did their best to instruct their converts to occupy their time\r\nin the fields, in the building of houses, of churches, of structures\r\nof all kinds necessary. They taught them to be self-supporting and\r\nto build up happy homes around them. The few industries, if the\r\nlittle then done by the natives in the way of manual labor can be\r\nclassed as industry, that existed among the people at that time were\r\ncopied from the Chinese and Mohammedan traders who visited and traded\r\nwith them. These industries however were but crude as a rule; and\r\nmoreover the connection with these anti-christian influences had to\r\nbe cut for the moral protection of the indian and therefore the friar\r\nmissionary, ever on the alert for his children's welfare, instructed\r\nthem in industries which, whilst occupying their time formerly spent\r\nin abject laziness, also gave them the advantage of money making.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as the natives had become accustomed to living after\r\nthe manner of civilized beings, the friars taught them the art of\r\nmaking lime, mortar and bricks and of utilizing these materials in\r\nbuildings and fortifications for the common protection against their\r\nenemies. They instructed them in the method of tilling the virgin\r\nand fertile soil, of utilizing the many streams of water that nature\r\nhad provided.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet there are those who would make us believe that the friar\r\nmissionary has done nothing to civilize the Filipinos. To whom then\r\ndo they owe the civilization they enjoy?\r\n\r\n[75] Faith in their anting-anting; courage to maltreat and murder the\r\nhelpless and sometimes dying prisoners that fell into their hands;\r\nand as to constancy...? The majority of the leaders eventually became\r\ntraitors to the most cherished ideas of independence. Three figures\r\nalone stand out as really constant throughout the whole rebellion,\r\nand these three are Aguinaldo, Mabini, and Pio del Pilar; and of these\r\nthree the most constant was Aguinaldo, a misguided man who deserves\r\nfar more honor than those who deserted him and who never thought of\r\nraising a finger to alleviate his hard lot, a lot for which they are\r\nmorally responsible.\r\n\r\n[76] A kind of altar on which bonfires are lighted for illumination.\r\n\r\n[77] The name of this plant signifies that it possesses the power to\r\nbring to life again--to resuscitate.\r\n\r\n[78] This granting of pardon to those who should present themselves\r\nis contained in Art. 7. of the proclamation of the Governor General\r\nBlanco, issued on the 30th of August 1896, and which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Art. 7. The rebels who present themselves to the authorities within\r\n48 hours after the publication of this proclamation, shall be exempt\r\nfrom punishment for rebellion, with the exception of the chiefs of the\r\nseditious groups and those who relapse into those crimes. The chiefs\r\nto whom reference is made shall be pardoned of the punishment due\r\nthem if they surrender within the fixed time suffering a punishment\r\nimmediately inferior according to grade.\"\r\n\r\n[79] Previous to 1896 Aguinaldo was an almost unknown indio. He was\r\nat that time about 23 or 24 years of age, and like the far greater\r\nmajority of the indios of the archipelago had forgotten what little\r\nhe had learned at school. He was a lavandero ((Washerman.))  for the\r\nArsenal at Cavite, and possessed little command over the Spanish\r\nlanguage, speaking it after the Cavite style, de cocina as the\r\nSpaniards say. He was the son of Carlos Aguinaldo who had several\r\ntimes held office under the Spanish Government, and who was at heart\r\na bitter anti-Spaniard. Like the remainder of his fellow Tagalogs,\r\nAguinaldo demonstrates a different character in connection with\r\neach event which takes place in his life. As capitan municipal in\r\n1896 he was very Spanish in dealing with the authorities, but in\r\ndealing with his own people quite the reverse. Like the Taveras,\r\nthe Legardas and the Buencaminos etc., he was an adept at political\r\nlightning changes. Buencamino in one of his absurd articles to the\r\nFilipino press (La Independencia, Sept. 6th 1896) speaking of him says:\r\n\"... all the Filipinos unconditionally obey the president Aguinaldo\r\nseeing in him the messenger of God sent to redeem the Filipino people\r\nfrom all foreign domination, and because they see in the said chief\r\nthe great virtues of fortitude, honor and magnanimity which ought to\r\nadorn all saviors of their country.\"\r\n\r\nThe belief among some Filipinos that Aguinaldo was a semi-God was\r\nnot uncommon at one time, and many hold to it even in these days. A\r\ncertain Bray (apparently related very closely to the bray of an ass)\r\nwent a step further in an article to the French Revue de Revues and\r\ncompared Aguinaldo to Christ, to Alexander the Great, to Mahomet,\r\nto Caesar, to Napoleon and others!\r\n\r\nAguinaldo certainly demonstrated fortitude, and did not sell his\r\nsword to those he considered his enemies. His misfortune was that\r\nhe fell into the hands of such advisers as Buencamino and others,\r\nwho, after working up his stupid pride, deserted him in his hour\r\nof need. Aguinaldo showed fortitude and was never a traitor to what\r\nhe considered the honor of his country. Honor to Aguinaldo in this\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n[80] As to the goodness of customs read the testimony of the most\r\nreliable chroniclers and historians of the earliest days of Spanish\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n[81] The pacto de sangre was performed thus: a wound was made in the\r\nbody of each person who was to form a party to the treaty about to be\r\nmade, and the blood that flowed from the wounds thus made was mixed\r\nin a receptacle prepared for the occasion; each then drank a portion\r\nof the blood thus mixed. It is needless to say that Legaspi refused\r\nto perform such a savage, cannibalistic ceremony.\r\n\r\n[82] Worthy perhaps but certainly not legitimate. The Katipunan was\r\nillegitimate from all points of view; nor was it a child really of\r\nBonifacio. The conception was of Pilar (Marcelo H.) and Bonifacio\r\nwas but the foster father encharged with the bringing up of the child.\r\n\r\n[83] A people's language is the expression of its sentiments. There\r\nare in this archipelago, native languages in which no word exists to\r\nexpress \"thank you.\"\r\n\r\n[84] F. Buenaventura Campa was one of the two Dominican Fathers who\r\nwillingly devoted themselves to the care of the sufferers stricken with\r\nthe cholera plague which has carried off so many people both in Manila\r\nand the provinces. He, together with his companion, P. Candido, bore\r\nwith remarkable patience and self-abnegation the troubles and trials\r\nconsequent upon the extraordinary plans adopted by an inexperienced\r\nSanitary Department for the treatment of the dread enemy.\r\n\r\n[85] Half mad.\r\n\r\n[86] Juan Utor y Fernandez (bro. Espartero) confessed that\r\nBlanco was a freemason; he affirmed also that his masonic name was\r\nbro. Barcelona. Lacasa, Lieut. Auditor of war, and one of the heads\r\nof freemasonry in the Philippines declared that among the freemasons\r\nof the archipelago was counted Sr. D. Ramon Blanco, Capt Gen. of the\r\nArmy and Gov. Gen. of the Islands.\r\n\r\n[87] The following interesting notes will give some idea of what the\r\nBlanco administration was like.\r\n\r\nIn the report of the secret police for the 3rd of June 1896, appears\r\nthe following:--\r\n\r\n\"Notice is hereby given of the confidential information given by a\r\nfreemason in respect to the reason why the masonic lodges are at rest,\r\nand the attitude of Generals Blanco and Echaluce in regard to the same.\r\n\r\n\"This freemason, Juan Merchan, says: \"we are now sleeping; we cannot\r\nwork; we are tutored by the experience of the persecution directed\r\nagainst us by General Echaluce. Until General Blanco returns from\r\nMindanao we can do nothing, for he at least does not disturb us, and\r\neven helps us. The proof of this is that during the previous voyage\r\nto Mindanao (of Blanco) Gen. Echaluce commenced to deport people;\r\nbut when Blanco got to know of it, he wrote to him ordering him not\r\nto deport anyone without his consent, and not to do anything in the\r\nmatter till his return from Mindanao.\"\r\n\r\n[88] El Katipunan, etc.; p. 89.\r\n\r\n[89] Blanco, whether because he was bound by compromise, or because\r\nof fear, heeded not the warnings of the approaching danger. As a\r\nsoldier face to face with an enemy Blanco was not lacking in courage;\r\nbut when the enemy was invisible, and more tact than courage was\r\nneeded in the combat, Blanco was like a little child in the dark,\r\nfrightened at the least sound--chicken hearted. It is certainly a\r\nremarkable thing that bro. Barcelona had the courage to pass through\r\nthe ordeals of his initiation into freemasonry.\r\n\r\n[90] The head of a pueblo. The most ancient form of rule in the\r\nArchipelago.\r\n\r\n[91] See page 63.\r\n\r\n[92] Pascual H. Poblete: a pobre diablo who speaks Spanish like a chino\r\nand writes it far worse. Poblete is greatly devoted to cock-fighting;\r\nbut being as reckless in the enjoyment of this sport as he is in\r\neverything else he undertakes, he finds his pocket always more or less\r\nempty. To fill this pocket he is ever hunting up schemes to make money\r\nin the easiest way possible. The subscription lists he has started\r\nfor various pious or patriotic objects are well nigh innumerable.\r\n\r\nThe Heraldo de Madrid, of the 19th of November 1896, says of this\r\ncharlatan:\r\n\r\n\"Well paired with Tomas del Rosario, the indio who, by literary fraud\r\ngained from Senor Nunez de Arce a good position in the Philippines,\r\nis Pascual H. Poblete also an indio ((If I am not in error, Poblete\r\nis a Chinee halfcaste.))  and a person of history too.\r\n\r\n\"His first steps in work in the newspapers of his country were as\r\ntranslator of the Spanish text of a bilingual review into Tagalog.\r\n\r\n\"He propagated political themes widely, but above all, those articles\r\nof the Civil and Penal code favorable to his countrymen; to these\r\narticles he added comments.... Under the pretext of competing with\r\nthe Chinese he founded a cooperative association which was the\r\nsubject of much talk. It was really nothing else than an association\r\ndistinctly political and eminently anti-Spanish. He however succeeded\r\nin dissimulating, and when he created the newspaper El Resumen,\r\nplaced a peninsular Spaniard, a native of Aragon, at its head. He\r\nthen did all he could to gain the confidence of Despujols, whom he\r\nvisited every once in a while.\r\n\r\n\"As Despujols step by step lost favor with the European element,\r\nPoblete praised him more and more and this was, in itself, a good sign\r\nof the direction in which was going this Poblete, a man lacking talent,\r\nlacking wit, and enjoying nothing but an insane intention. During\r\nthe last years he made continuous anti-Spanish propaganda, and was\r\na bitter enemy of the Spaniards, excepting some few degenerates who\r\nyet believed in the good faith of this pobre diablo.\"\r\n\r\nIn later days he changed his religion--that is if he ever had\r\none to change, and devoted himself to sponging upon the Bible\r\nSocieties and the protestant and Mormon missionaries who came to the\r\nPhilippines. On one occasion he translated from Spanish into Tagalog\r\nthe Holy Scriptures, and seeing that never in his life had he been a\r\nsuccessful translator even of newspaper paragraphs, but could only\r\nsucceed in giving little more than a very general idea of what was\r\ncontained in the Spanish text, it was not to be wondered at that,\r\nas a famous literary critic well versed in the Tagalog once said:\r\n\"Poblete's Tagalog bible reads more like a badly written chronicle\r\nthan a version of the sacred Scriptures. If I thought that our Lord\r\nand his Apostles preached and taught what Poblete puts into their\r\nmouths, I would go to China and become a disciple of Confucius.\"\r\n\r\nIn the latter days of Spanish rule Poblete was always more or less\r\nunder the eyes of the authorities, and on the 17th of April 1896 the\r\nSecret Police asked of General Blanco the necessary permission to\r\nsearch the houses of several highly suspicious people, among them\r\nthat of Pascual H. Poblete.\r\n\r\nOur hero figured at one time as an expert in the raising of\r\nsubscriptions for monuments and if I am not very much mistaken,\r\nhe once had a hand in the raising of money for the coming monument\r\nto Rizal the hero and martyr of the Filipino Libre party. It would\r\nbe very interesting to know what became of all the funds that passed\r\nthrough his hands: the majority apparently went to back his favorite\r\nbirds at the cock-pits.\r\n\r\nSince the American occupation Poblete's chief enterprise, apart\r\nfrom cock-fighting and \"sponging upon the ignorantes who listened\r\nto his ravings with more or less favor because he was a protestant,\r\nwas the editing and publishing of a dirty little \"sheet\" known as\r\nthe Ang Kapatid nang Bayan.\" In this so called newspaper Poblete\r\naired his radical political ideas with such vigor that the Provost\r\nMarshal was compelled to call him down. The pobre diablo then turned\r\nhis attention to another pastime which would combine the advantages of\r\ndemonstrating his unsurpassable abilities, of airing his opinions and,\r\nlast mentioned but of the greatest importance, the quality of putting\r\ninto his pocket a goodly number of easily earned dollars. This pastime\r\ntook the shape of a theatrical enterprise: Constancia, the daughter of\r\nthe said mountebank \"composed and wrote\" a play entitled Ang Pag Ibig\r\nSa Lupang Tinubinan: For the Love of Country. Poblete's better half\r\n(which is not saying much) played the part of the heroine. The whole\r\nplay was incendiary in the extreme and the audience being Tagalogs\r\nof the lowest and most ignorant class, the result was that they were\r\nthrown into a state of the greatest frenzy. Poblete put this play\r\non the boards of the Teatro Oriental. All went well in the first\r\nacts; and following out the \"plot\" of the play, the town of Imus was\r\nsupposed to have been taken by the rebels. Dramatic shouts of Viva La\r\nIndependencia; were raised from time to time by the actors, followed by\r\nshouts from the audience of Viva Filipinas! Viva Aguinaldo! Suddenly\r\nthere rushed from the \"wings\" a gaudy looking creature who ought to\r\nhave been the Tondo market selling cockles and crabs; this turned out\r\nto be the heroine. In one hand she held a revolutionary flag and in\r\nthe other a bolo. Viva La Independencia was the shout which almost\r\nraised the roof; but as fate would have it Poblete was doomed to be\r\nhumbled to the dust. Just as he was promising himself a fine string\r\nof dollars from his new enterprise Capt. Lara and a number of police\r\nappeared on the scene, and Poblete, his katipunan banners and bolos\r\netc., were seized and the house cleared of its fanatical occupants.\r\n\r\nTo-day he amuses himself in fitting out bands of little boys who on\r\n\"state\" occasions parade the streets with American flags and Japanese\r\nlanterns, and placards with various inscriptions, the chief ones\r\nbeing petitions for an amnesty on behalf of all those who have \"done\r\nwhat they ought not to have done\". Poblete would open the doors of\r\nthe prisons of the Archipelago and let loose all their occupants. The\r\nresult? A political boom for Poblete, an increase in the membership of\r\nthe Partido Nacionalista and an increase of crime to a thousand fold,\r\nnot only in Manila but throughout the whole archipelago.\r\n\r\nPoor Poblete a pobre infeliz, a stain upon the good name of the\r\nfilipino. But then, what would Filipinas be without her Poblete;\r\nalmost like a cat without fleas.\r\n\r\n[93] Cruz Herrera, now alcalde of Manila, was another upon whom the\r\nauthorities took pity on account of the rheumatism from which he\r\nsuffered to such an extent that he could scarcely walk.\r\n\r\n[94] This was Alfonso XII. the anniversary of whose death fell of the\r\n25th of November. Archbishop Payo had been suffering for a considerable\r\ntime from dysentery. Apart from this, the bitterness of the official\r\nrelations at that time between the civil and ecclesiastical authorities\r\nhad completely incapacitated the venerable prelate from attending\r\nto his official duties. Consequently, acting upon the advice of his\r\nphysician, the Archbishop left Manila for Navotas for a few days of\r\ncomplete rest. The departure of the Archbishop happened to almost\r\ncoincide with the anniversary of the death of the King; but as the\r\nprelate was physically unable to attend to the pontifical ceremonies\r\nwhich were to be held on that day and to the other functions consequent\r\nupon such a solemn occasion, he was wisely advised to absent himself\r\nfrom the city.\r\n\r\nFreemasonry ever on the watch, saw in this an opportunity to attack\r\nthe Religious Orders, and taking advantage of it, demanded: \"The\r\ninsult committed by the archbishop being therefore very culpable,\r\nand having caused the greatest indignation to the government, to\r\nthe nation, and in particular to those of this country, as devoted\r\nto their king; it is indispensable to expel him from this soil,\r\nimposing upon him the penalty of temporary banishment marked out by\r\narticle 142 of the penal code.\r\n\r\n[95] To judge from his writing, Isabelo held the idea that he alone\r\nwas able to direct everything connected with the revolt. Isabelo\r\ntakes upon himself the intellectual work of the affair leaving to\r\nothers the dirty work.",
